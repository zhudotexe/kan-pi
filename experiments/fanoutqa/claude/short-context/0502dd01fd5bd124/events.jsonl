Among the fastest animals in the sea is the black marlin, with uncertain and conflicting reports of recorded speeds.[2][3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Eland | 55–70 km/h (34–43 mph)[62] | Estimated by observing the odometer when an animal ran at its maximum speed, alongside a vehicle on a road.\n |\n| Coyote | 60–65 km/h (37–40 mph)[m] | Coyotes can easily reach 48 km/h (30 mph), and can sprint at 65 km/h (40 mph) when hunting.[95] Even without a front foot, a coyote can still run at around 32 km/h (20 mph).[94] |\n| Big brown bat(flight) | 56–64 km/h (35–40 mph)\n | Big brown bats are reported to be one of the fastest bats reaching speeds of up to 40 mph.[97] |\n| Common dolphin(swimming) | 55–64 km/h (34–40 mph)[n] | Common dolphins are the fastest marine mammals. When reaching their top speed, they take very short breaths. As an example, fin whales, which are much larger, can empty and refill their lungs in 2 seconds\n |\n| Tiger | 56–64 km/h (35–40 mph)[o] | Tigers live in jungles, and have been recorded going anywhere from 30 mph (48 km/h) to 40 mph (64 km/h); much like the cheetah and lion, however, they only maintain this for a short burst.\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n**List of animals by speed**\n| Rank\n | Animal\n | Maximum speed\n | Class\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | Peregrine falcon | 389 km/h (242 mph)108 m/s (354 ft/s)[1][7] | Flight-diving\n | The peregrine falcon is the fastest aerial animal, fastest animal in flight, fastest bird, and the overall fastest member of the animal kingdom. The peregrine achieves its highest velocity not in horizontal level flight, but during its characteristic hunting stoop (vertical flight). While stooping, the peregrine falcon soars to a great height, then dives steeply at speeds of over 320 km/h (200 mph).[1]Assuming the maximum size at 58 cm, its relative speed clocks at 186 body lengths per second during its hunting swoop, the equivalent of a human running at 170 m/s (560 ft/s).\n |\n| 2\n | Golden eagle | 240–320 km/h (150–200 mph)67–89 m/s (220–293 ft/s)[8] | Flight-diving\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Animal\n | Maximum speed\n | **Notes** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Mexican free-tailed bat(in flight) | 160 km/h (99 mph)[13] | They are the fastest mammal in the world and one of the fastest flying animals on level flight.\n |\n| Cheetah | 109.4–120.7 km/h (68.0–75.0 mph)[d] | The cheetah can accelerate from 0 to 96.6 km/h (60.0 mph) in under three seconds,[54] though endurance is limited: most cheetahs run for only 60 seconds at a time.[18] When sprinting, cheetahs spend more time in the air than on the ground.[55] See *Sarah*, the fastest cheetah.\nA widely quoted top speed figure of 71 mph (113 Km/h) has been discredited due to lax and questionable methodology.[56] The highest speed reliably and rigorously measured in cheetahs in a straight line is 29 m/s (104 Km/h), as an average of 3 runs over a 201.2-meter (220 yards) course (starting from start line already running).[57][58]\nTop speed data is result of dividing distance by time spent.\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Animal\n | Maximum recorded speed\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Perentie | 40.23 km/h (25.00 mph) | Generally considered the fastest recorded reptile\n |\n| Green Iguana | 35.41 km/h (22.00 mph)[41] | Green Iguanas are large arboreal lizards capable of running at high speed on the ground.\n |\n| Leatherback sea turtle | 35.28 km/h (21.92 mph)[42] | Leatherback turtles have the most hydrodynamic body design of any sea turtle, with a large, teardrop-shaped body.\n |\n| Costa Rican spiny-tailed iguana | 34.6 km/h (21.5 mph)[43] | Often cited as the world's fastest lizard in older sources.\n |\n| Six-lined racerunner | 28.97 km/h (18.00 mph)\n | A small lizard found throughout the Southern United States and Mexico.\n |\n| Black mamba | 22.53 km/h (14.00 mph)[44] |  |\n| Komodo dragon | 20.92 km/h (13.00 mph)[45] | Komodo dragons can run briefly up to 13 mph (21 km/h) but prefer to hunt by stealth.[45] |\n\n\n## Birds[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of birds by flight speed\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Tsessebe | 70–90 km/h (43–56 mph)[60][61][62] | Estimated by observing the odometer when an animal ran at its maximum speed, alongside a vehicle on a road.\n |\n| Domestic Horse | 70.76–88.5 km/h (43.97–54.99 mph)[63] | The fastest horse speed was achieved by a thoroughbred.\n |\n| Thomson's gazelle | 81 km/h (50 mph)[62][e] | Thomson's gazelles, being long-distance runners, can escape cheetahs by sheer endurance.[65] Their speed is partially due to their \"stotting\", or bounding leaps.[64]\nEstimated by observing the odometer when an animal ran at its maximum speed, alongside a vehicle on a road.[62]\n |\n| Wildebeest | 80.5 km/h (50.0 mph)[62][f] | The wildebeest, an antelope, exists as two species: the blue wildebeest and the black wildebeest.

While not the fastest bird at level (horizontal) flight, its great speed is achieved in its hunting dive (vertical flight), the stoop, wherein it soars to a great height, then dives steeply at speeds of over 200 mph (320 km/h).\n |\n| Golden eagle | 240–320 km/h (150–200 mph)\n | In full stoop, a golden eagle can reach spectacular speeds of up to 240 to 320 kilometers per hour (150 to 200 mph) when diving after prey. Although less agile and maneuverable, the golden eagle is apparently quite the equal and possibly even the superior of the peregrine falcon's stooping and gliding speed.\n |\n| White-throated needletail | 169 km/h (105 mph)[9][10][11] | The fastest-flying bird in flapping flight.\n |\n| Eurasian hobby | 160 km/h (100 mph)[12] | It can sometimes even outfly birds such as the swift when hunting.\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Animal\n | Maximum recorded speed\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Black marlin | 132 km/h (82 mph)[*citation needed*][*dubious – discuss*] | A hooked black marlin has been recorded stripping line off a fishing reel at 120 feet per second (82 mph; 132 km/h).\n |\n| Sailfish | 109.19 km/h (67.85 mph)[*citation needed*][*dubious – discuss*] | In a series of tests carried out in a fishing cam at Long Key, Florida, United States, sailfish swam and leapt 91 meters (300 feet) in 3 seconds, equivalent to a speed of 109 km/h (68 mph), although this speed includes leaps out of the water, which do not strictly qualify as swimming speed.\n |\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_01RkcMBR6fKUkHyGACTWH3dC","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
