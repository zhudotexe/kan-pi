Peregrine Falcon (Falco peregrinus)\n- Maximum speed: 389 km/h (242 mph)\n- Note: This is achieved during diving/stooping, making it the fastest animal in the world\n\n2. Golden Eagle (Aquila chrysaetos)\n- Maximum speed: 240-320 km/h (150-200 mph)\n- Note: This speed is also achieved during diving/stooping\n\n3. White-throated Needletail (Hirundapus caudacutus)\n- Maximum speed: 169 km/h (105 mph)\n- Note: Fastest bird in level (flapping) flight\n\n4. Mexican Free-tailed Bat (Tadarida brasiliensis)\n- Maximum speed: 160 km/h (99 mph)\n- Note: Fastest mammal in level flight\n\n5. Cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus)\n- Maximum speed: 109.4-120.7 km/h (68-75 mph)\n- Note: Fastest land animal, can accelerate from 0 to 96.6 km/h (60 mph) in under three seconds\n\nIt's worth noting that some of these speeds, particularly for aquatic animals like sailfish and black marlin, are disputed or need additional verification. I've included the most reliably documented speeds in this list.",

Among the fastest animals in the sea is the black marlin, with uncertain and conflicting reports of recorded speeds.[2][3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Eland | 55\u201370\u00a0km/h (34\u201343\u00a0mph)[62] | Estimated by observing the odometer when an animal ran at its maximum speed, alongside a vehicle on a road.\n |\n| Coyote | 60\u201365\u00a0km/h (37\u201340\u00a0mph)[m] | Coyotes can easily reach 48\u00a0km/h (30\u00a0mph), and can sprint at 65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph) when hunting.[95] Even without a front foot, a coyote can still run at around 32\u00a0km/h (20\u00a0mph).[94] |\n| Big brown bat(flight) | 56\u201364\u00a0km/h (35\u201340\u00a0mph)\n | Big brown bats are reported to be one of the fastest bats reaching speeds of up to 40\u00a0mph.[97] |\n| Common dolphin(swimming) | 55\u201364\u00a0km/h (34\u201340\u00a0mph)[n] | Common dolphins are the fastest marine mammals. When reaching their top speed, they take very short breaths. As an example, fin whales, which are much larger, can empty and refill their lungs in 2 seconds\n |\n| Tiger | 56\u201364\u00a0km/h (35\u201340\u00a0mph)[o] | Tigers live in jungles, and have been recorded going anywhere from 30\u00a0mph (48\u00a0km/h) to 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h); much like the cheetah and lion, however, they only maintain this for a short burst.\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n**List of animals by speed**\n| Rank\n | Animal\n | Maximum speed\n | Class\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | Peregrine falcon | 389\u00a0km/h (242\u00a0mph)108\u00a0m/s (354\u00a0ft/s)[1][7] | Flight-diving\n | The peregrine falcon is the fastest aerial animal, fastest animal in flight, fastest bird, and the overall fastest member of the animal kingdom. The peregrine achieves its highest velocity not in horizontal level flight, but during its characteristic hunting stoop (vertical flight). While stooping, the peregrine falcon soars to a great height, then dives steeply at speeds of over 320\u00a0km/h (200\u00a0mph).[1]Assuming the maximum size at 58\u00a0cm, its relative speed clocks at 186 body lengths per second during its hunting swoop, the equivalent of a human running at 170\u00a0m/s (560\u00a0ft/s).\n |\n| 2\n | Golden eagle | 240\u2013320\u00a0km/h (150\u2013200\u00a0mph)67\u201389\u00a0m/s (220\u2013293\u00a0ft/s)[8] | Flight-diving\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Animal\n | Maximum speed\n | **Notes** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Mexican free-tailed bat(in flight) | 160\u00a0km/h (99\u00a0mph)[13] | They are the fastest mammal in the world and one of the fastest flying animals on level flight.\n |\n| Cheetah | 109.4\u2013120.7\u00a0km/h (68.0\u201375.0\u00a0mph)[d] | The cheetah can accelerate from 0 to 96.6\u00a0km/h (60.0\u00a0mph) in under three seconds,[54] though endurance is limited: most cheetahs run for only 60 seconds at a time.[18] When sprinting, cheetahs spend more time in the air than on the ground.[55] See *Sarah*, the fastest cheetah.\nA widely quoted top speed figure of 71\u00a0mph (113 Km/h) has been discredited due to lax and questionable methodology.[56] The highest speed reliably and rigorously measured in cheetahs in a straight line is 29\u00a0m/s (104 Km/h), as an average of 3 runs over a 201.2-meter (220 yards) course (starting from start line already running).[57][58]\nTop speed data is result of dividing distance by time spent.\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Animal\n | Maximum recorded speed\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Perentie | 40.23\u00a0km/h (25.00\u00a0mph) | Generally considered the fastest recorded reptile\n |\n| Green Iguana | 35.41\u00a0km/h (22.00\u00a0mph)[41] | Green Iguanas are large arboreal lizards capable of running at high speed on the ground.\n |\n| Leatherback sea turtle | 35.28\u00a0km/h (21.92\u00a0mph)[42] | Leatherback turtles have the most hydrodynamic body design of any sea turtle, with a large, teardrop-shaped body.\n |\n| Costa Rican spiny-tailed iguana | 34.6\u00a0km/h (21.5\u00a0mph)[43] | Often cited as the world's fastest lizard in older sources.\n |\n| Six-lined racerunner | 28.97\u00a0km/h (18.00\u00a0mph)\n | A small lizard found throughout the Southern United States and Mexico.\n |\n| Black mamba | 22.53\u00a0km/h (14.00\u00a0mph)[44] |  |\n| Komodo dragon | 20.92\u00a0km/h (13.00\u00a0mph)[45] | Komodo dragons can run briefly up to 13\u00a0mph (21\u00a0km/h) but prefer to hunt by stealth.[45] |\n\n\n## Birds[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of birds by flight speed\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Tsessebe | 70\u201390\u00a0km/h (43\u201356\u00a0mph)[60][61][62] | Estimated by observing the odometer when an animal ran at its maximum speed, alongside a vehicle on a road.\n |\n| Domestic Horse | 70.76\u201388.5\u00a0km/h (43.97\u201354.99\u00a0mph)[63] | The fastest horse speed was achieved by a thoroughbred.\n |\n| Thomson's gazelle | 81\u00a0km/h (50\u00a0mph)[62][e] | Thomson's gazelles, being long-distance runners, can escape cheetahs by sheer endurance.[65] Their speed is partially due to their \"stotting\", or bounding leaps.[64]\nEstimated by observing the odometer when an animal ran at its maximum speed, alongside a vehicle on a road.[62]\n |\n| Wildebeest | 80.5\u00a0km/h (50.0\u00a0mph)[62][f] | The wildebeest, an antelope, exists as two species: the blue wildebeest and the black wildebeest. Both are extremely fast runners, which allows them to flee from predators.[34] They are better at maintaining endurance for long distances than at sprinting.[33]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n4. ^ ***a*** ***b*** PTI (28 April 2014). \"Mite runs faster than cheetah, sets record as world's fastest land animal\".

Golden Eagle (Aquila chrysaetos)\n- Maximum speed: 240-320 km/h (150-200 mph)\n- Note: This speed is also achieved during diving/stooping\n\n3. White-throated Needletail (Hirundapus caudacutus)\n- Maximum speed: 169 km/h (105 mph)\n- Note: Fastest bird in level (flapping) flight\n\n4. Mexican Free-tailed Bat (Tadarida brasiliensis)\n- Maximum speed: 160 km/h (99 mph)\n- Note: Fastest mammal in level flight\n\n5. Cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus)\n- Maximum speed: 109.4-120.7 km/h (68-75 mph)\n- Note: Fastest land animal, can accelerate from 0 to 96.6 km/h (60 mph) in under three seconds\n\nIt's worth noting that some of these speeds, particularly for aquatic animals like sailfish and black marlin, are disputed or need additional verification.
