The Chinese (or 'Sinitic') languages are typically divided into seven major language groups, and their study is a distinct academic discipline.[1] They differ as much from each other morphologically and phonetically as do English, German and Danish, but meanwhile share the same writing system (Hanzi) and are mutually intelligible in written form.

Gordon Brown, the former British prime minister, estimated that the total English-speaking population in China would outnumber the native speakers in the rest of the world in two decades.[22]\n\n\nThere have been a growing number of students studying Arabic, due to reasons of cultural interest and belief in better job opportunities.[23] The language is also widely studied amongst the Hui people.[24] In the past, literary Arabic education was promoted in Islamic schools by the Kuomintang when it ruled mainland China.[25]\n\n\nThere have also been a growing number of students choosing to learn Urdu, due to interest in Pakistani culture, close ties between the respective nations, and job opportunities provided by the CPEC.[26]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Sinitic\n\t+ Chinese, \u6c49\u8bed, \u6f22\u8a9e\n\t\t- Mandarin Chinese, \u5b98\u8bdd, \u5b98\u8a71\n\t\t\t* Beijing Mandarin, \u5317\u4eac\u5b98\u8bdd, \u5317\u4eac\u5b98\u8a71\n\t\t\t\t+ Standard Chinese, \u666e\u901a\u8bdd, \u666e\u901a\u8a71\n\t\t\t\t+ Singaporean Mandarin, \u65b0\u52a0\u5761\u534e\u8bed, \u65b0\u52a0\u5761\u83ef\u8a9e\n\t\t\t\t+ Malaysian Mandarin, \u9a6c\u6765\u897f\u4e9a\u534e\u8bed, \u99ac\u4f86\u897f\u4e9e\u83ef\u8a9e\n\t\t\t* Taiwanese Mandarin, \u53f0\u6e7e\u534e\u8bed, \u81fa\u7063\u83ef\u8a9e\n\t\t\t\t+ Taipei Mandarin, \u53f0\u5317\u8154/\u56fd\u8bed, \u81fa\u5317\u8154/\u570b\u8a9e\n\t\t\t* Northeastern Mandarin, \u4e1c\u5317\u5b98\u8bdd, \u6771\u5317\u5b98\u8a71\n\t\t\t* Jilu Mandarin, \u5180\u9c81\u5b98\u8bdd, \u5180\u9b6f\u5b98\u8a71\n\t\t\t* Jiaoliao Mandarin, \u80f6\u8fbd\u5b98\u8bdd, \u81a0\u907c\u5b98\u8a71\n\t\t\t* Zhongyuan Mandarin, \u4e2d\u539f\u5b98\u8bdd, \u4e2d\u539f\u5b98\u8a71\n\t\t\t* Lanyin Mandarin, \u5170\u94f6\u5b98\u8bdd, \u862d\u9280\u5b98\u8a71\n\t\t\t* Lower Yangtze Mandarin, \u6c5f\u6dee\u5b98\u8bdd, \u6c5f\u6dee\u5b98\u8a71\n\t\t\t* Southwestern Mandarin, \u897f\u5357\u5b98\u8bdd, \u897f\u5357\u5b98\u8a71\n\t\t- Jin Chinese, \u664b\u8bed, \u6649\u8a9e\n\t\t- Wu Chinese, \u5434\u8bed, \u5433\u8a9e\n\t\t\t* Shanghainese, \u4e0a\u6d77\u8bdd, \u4e0a\u6d77\u8a71\n\t\t- Huizhou Chinese, \u5fbd\u8bed, \u5fbd\u8a9e\n\t\t- Yue Chinese, \u7ca4\u8bed, \u7ca4\u8a9e\n\t\t\t* Cantonese, \u5e7f\u4e1c\u8bdd, \u5ee3\u6771\u8a71\n\t\t- Ping Chinese, \u5e73\u8bdd, \u5e73\u8a71\n\t\t- Gan Chinese, \u8d63\u8bed, \u8d1b\u8a9e\n\t\t- Xiang Chinese, \u6e58\u8bed, \u6e58\u8a9e\n\t\t- Hakka language, \u5ba2\u5bb6\u8bdd, \u5ba2\u5bb6\u8a71\n\t\t- Min Chinese, \u95fd\u8bed, \u95a9\u8a9e\n\t\t\t* Southern Min, \u95fd\u5357\u8bed, \u95a9\u5357\u8a9e\n\t\t\t\t+ Hokkien, \u6cc9\u6f33\u8bdd, \u6cc9\u6f33\u8a71\n\t\t\t\t+ Teochew dialect, \u6f6e\u5dde\u8bdd, \u6f6e\u5dde\u8a71\n\t\t\t* Eastern Min, \u95fd\u4e1c\u8bed, \u95a9\u6771\u8a9e\n\t\t\t* Pu-Xian Min, \u8386\u4ed9\u8bdd, \u8386\u4ed9\u8a71\n\t\t\t* Leizhou Min, \u96f7\u5dde\u8bdd, \u96f7\u5dde\u8a71\n\t\t\t* Hainanese, \u6d77\u5357\u8bdd, \u6d77\u5357\u8a71\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Ethnolinguistic map of China\n* The Sino-Tibetan family: 19 official ethnicities (including the Han and Tibetans)\n* The Tai\u2013Kadai family: several languages spoken by the Zhuang, the Bouyei, the Dai, the Dong, and the Hlai (Li people). 9 official ethnicities.\n* The Hmong\u2013Mien family: 3 official ethnicities\n* The Austroasiatic family: 4 official ethnicities (the De'ang, Blang, Gin (Vietnamese), and Wa)\n* The Turkic family: Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Salars, etc. 7 official ethnicities.[6]\n* The Mongolic family: Mongols, Dongxiang, and related groups. 6 official ethnicities.[6]\n* The Tungusic family: Manchus (formerly), Hezhe, etc. 5 official ethnicities.\n* The Koreanic family: Korean language\n* The Indo-European family: 2 official ethnicities, the Russians and Tajiks (actually Pamiri people).

Telugu is an official language in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Yanam, making it one of the few languages (along with Hindi, Bengali, and Urdu) with official status in more than one state. It is also spoken by a significant number of people in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Chhattisgarh, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and by the Sri Lankan Gypsy people. It is one of six languages with classical status in India. Telugu ranks fourth by the number of native speakers in India (81\u00a0million in the 2011 Census),[159] fifteenth in the *Ethnologue* list of most-spoken languages worldwide and is the most widely spoken Dravidian language.\n\n\n\n### Tamil[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tamil language\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe first official survey of language diversity in the Indian subcontinent was carried out by Sir George Abraham Grierson from 1898 to 1928. Titled the Linguistic Survey of India, it reported a total of 179 languages and 544 dialects.[40] However, the results were skewed due to ambiguities in distinguishing between \"dialect\" and \"language\",[40] use of untrained personnel and under-reporting of data from South India, as the former provinces of Burma and Madras, as well as the princely states of Cochin, Hyderabad, Mysore and Travancore were not included in the survey.[41]\n\n\nDifferent sources give widely differing figures, primarily based on how the terms \"language\" and \"dialect\" are defined and grouped. *Ethnologue*, produced by the Christian evangelist organisation SIL International, lists 461 tongues for India (out of 6,912 worldwide), 447 of which are living, while 14 are extinct. The 447 living languages are further subclassified in *Ethnologue* as follows:[42][43]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
