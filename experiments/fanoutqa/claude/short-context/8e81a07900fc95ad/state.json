The Union was a heterogeneous alliance, which was formed by centrist parties like UDEUR and communists like PRC and Party of Italian Communists.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 19 April 2006, Italy's Supreme Court of Cassation ruled that Prodi had indeed won the election, winning control of the Chamber of Deputies by only 24,755 votes out of more than 38 million votes cast, and winning 158 seats in the Senate to 156 for Berlusconi's coalition. Even so, Berlusconi refused to concede defeat, claiming unproven fraud.\n\n\n\n### Government formation[edit]\n\n\nProdi's appointment was somewhat delayed, as the outgoing President of the Republic, Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, ended his mandate in May, not having enough time for the usual procedure (consultations made by the President, appointment of a Prime Minister, the motion of confidence and oath of office). After the acrimonious election of Giorgio Napolitano to replace Ciampi, Prodi could proceed with his transition to government. On 16 May he was invited by Napolitano to form a government. The following day, 17 May 2006, Prodi and his second cabinet were sworn into office.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA former professor of economics and international advisor to Goldman Sachs, Prodi ran as lead candidate of The Olive Tree coalition, winning the 1996 Italian general election and serving as Prime Minister until 1998. Following the victory of his coalition The Union over the House of Freedoms led by Silvio Berlusconi in the 2006 Italian general election, Prodi took power again. On 24 January 2008, he lost a vote of confidence in the Senate and consequently tendered his resignation as Prime Minister to President Giorgio Napolitano; he continued in office for almost four months for routine business until early elections were held and a new government was formed. Prodi has been the first left-leaning candidate to ever come first at legislative elections since the 1921 Italian general election and to manage to form a government without the need of opponents' parliamentary support.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nProdi's government fell in 1998 when the Communist Refoundation Party withdrew its external support. This led to the formation of a new government led by Massimo D'Alema as Prime Minister. There are those who claim that D'Alema, along with People's Party leader Franco Marini, deliberately engineered the collapse of the Prodi government to become Prime Minister himself.[46] As the result of a vote of no confidence in Prodi's government, D'Alema's nomination was passed by a single vote. This was the first occasion in the history of the Italian Republic on which a vote of no confidence had ever been called; the Republic's many previous governments had been brought down by a majority \"no\" vote on some crucially important piece of legislation (such as the budget).\n\n\n\n## President of the European Commission (1999\u20132004)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Prodi Commission\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Romano Prodi\n |\n| --- |\n| | * v\n* t\n* e\nPrime Ministers of Italy\n |\n| --- |\n| Kingdom of Italy | ![](image)\n* Cavour\n* Ricasoli\n* Rattazzi\n* Farini\n* Minghetti\n* La Marmora\n* Ricasoli\n* Rattazzi\n* Menabrea\n* Lanza\n* Minghetti\n* Depretis\n* Cairoli\n* Depretis\n* Cairoli\n* Depretis\n* Crispi\n* Starabba\n* Giolitti\n* Crispi\n* Starabba\n* Pelloux\n* Saracco\n* Zanardelli\n* Giolitti\n* Tittoni\n* Fortis\n* Sonnino\n* Giolitti\n* Sonnino\n* Luzzatti\n* Giolitti\n* Salandra\n* Boselli\n* Orlando\n* Nitti\n* Giolitti\n* Bonomi\n* Facta\n* Mussolini\n* Badoglio\n* Bonomi\n* Parri\n* De Gasperi\n |\n| Italian Republic | ![](image)\n- De Gasperi\n\n- Pella\n\n- Fanfani\n\n- Scelba\n\n- Segni\n\n- Zoli\n\n- Fanfani\n\n- Segni\n\n- Tambroni\n\n- Fanfani\n\n- Leone\n\n- Moro\n\n- Leone\n\n- Rumor\n\n- Colombo\n\n- Andreotti\n\n- Rumor\n\n- Moro\n\n- Andreotti\n\n- Cossiga\n\n- Forlani\n\n- Spadolini\n\n- Fanfani\n\n- Craxi\n\n- Fanfani\n\n- Goria\n\n- De Mita\n\n- Andreotti\n\n- Amato\n\n- Ciampi\n\n- Berlusconi\n\n- Dini\n\n- Prodi\n\n- D'Alema\n\n- Amato\n\n- Berlusconi\n\n- Prodi\n\n- Berlusconi\n\n- Monti\n\n- Letta\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Romano Prodi\nOMRI\n |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)Prodi in 2016\n |\n|  |\n| Prime Minister of Italy |\n| **In office**17 May 2006\u00a0\u2013 8 May 2008 |\n| President | Giorgio Napolitano |\n| Deputy | * Massimo D'Alema\n* Francesco Rutelli\n |\n| Preceded by | Silvio Berlusconi |\n| Succeeded by | Silvio Berlusconi |\n| **In office**18 May 1996\u00a0\u2013 21 October 1998 |\n| President | Oscar Luigi Scalfaro |\n| Deputy | Walter Veltroni |\n| Preceded by | Lamberto Dini |\n| Succeeded by | Massimo D'Alema |\n| President of the European Commission |\n| **In office**16 September 1999\u00a0\u2013 21 November 2004 |\n| Vice President | Neil Kinnock |\n| Preceded by | Manuel Mar\u00edn (*Acting*) |\n| Succeeded by | Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso |\n| President of the Democratic Party |\n| **In office**14 October 2007\u00a0\u2013 16 April 2008 |\n| Secretary | Walter Veltroni |\n| Preceded by | *Position established* |\n| Succeeded by | Rosy Bindi |\n| President of the Institute for Industrial Reconstruction |\n| **In office**20 May 1993\u00a0\u2013 27 July 1994 |\n| Preceded by | Franco Nobili |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Political offices\n |\n| --- |\n| Preceded\u00a0byCarlo Donat-Cattin\n |  **Minister of Industry, Commerce and Crafts** 1978\u20131979\n | Succeeded\u00a0byFranco Nicolazzi\n |\n| Preceded\u00a0byLamberto Dini\n |  **Prime Minister of Italy** 1996\u20131998\n | Succeeded\u00a0byMassimo D'Alema\n |\n| Preceded\u00a0byManuel Mar\u00edn\n |  **President of the European Commission** 1999\u20132004\n | Succeeded\u00a0byJos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso\n |\n| Preceded\u00a0bySilvio Berlusconi\n |  **Prime Minister of Italy** 2006\u20132008\n | Succeeded\u00a0bySilvio Berlusconi\n |\n| Party political offices\n |\n| **Position established**  |  **Leader of The Olive Tree** 1995\u20131998\n | Succeeded\u00a0byMassimo D'Alema\n |\n| Preceded\u00a0byFrancesco Rutelli\n |  **Leader of The Olive Tree** 2004\u20132007\n | **Position abolished**  |\n| **Position established**  |  **President of the Democratic Party** 2007\u20132008\n | Succeeded\u00a0byRosy Bindi\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n- Renzi\n\n- Gentiloni\n\n- Conte\n\n- Draghi\n\n- Meloni\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nAndreotti IV Cabinet (1978\u201379)\n |\n| --- |\n| * De Mita\n* Forlani\n* Cossiga/Andreotti (*interim*)/Rognoni\n* Bonifacio\n* Morlino\n* Malfatti\n* Pandolfi\n* Ruffini\n* Pedini\n* Stammati\n* Marcora\n* Colombo\n* Gullotti\n* Donat-Cattin/Prodi\n* Anselmi\n* Ossola\n* Colombo (*interim*)\n* Bisaglia\n* Scotti\n* Antoniozzi\n* Pastorino\n | ![](image)\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nProdi I Cabinet (1996\u201398)\n |\n| --- |\n| * Veltroni\n* Dini\n* Napolitano\n* Ciampi\n* Visco\n* Andreatta\n* Flick\n* Bersani\n* Pinto\n* Berlinguer\n* Bindi\n* Treu\n* Di Pietro\n* Costa\n* Burlando\n* Ronchi\n* Maccanico\n* Fantozzi\n* Bassanini\n* Turco\n* Finocchiaro\n* Bogi\n | ![](image)\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe UDEUR defection forced caused Prodi to ask for a confidence vote in both Chambers: he won a clear majority in the Chamber of Deputies on 23 January,[72] but was defeated 156 to 161 (with 1 abstention)[73] in the Senate the next day. He therefore tendered his resignation as Prime Minister to President Giorgio Napolitano, who accepted it and appointed the President of the Senate, Franco Marini, with the task of evaluating possibilities for forming interim government to implement electoral reforms prior to holding elections. Marini, after consultation with all major political forces, acknowledged the impossibility of doing so on 5 February, forcing Napolitano to announce the end of the legislature.[74] Prodi said that he would not seek to lead a new government and snap election were called.[75] In the election that followed in April 2008, Berlusconi's centre-right The People of Freedom and allies defeated the Democratic Party.[76]\n\n\n\n## After the premiership (2008\u2013present)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n53. **^** Unione, quasi 4 milioni di elettori.

Though facing strong opposition from the centre-right coalition, the vote resulted in a 162\u2013157 victory.

He supported the PS candidate S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal during her campaign for the 2007 French presidential election.[108]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe theory that the bombing affected the result is a counterfactual that cannot be verified. As elections in European states hinge on social and economic policies mainly, it is equally possible the terrorist events had no notable effect. In this regard, a majority of 74%[70] of the Spanish people were against Spanish involvement in the war.\n\n\nOn 13 June 2004 (three months after the General Election) the Election for the European Parliament took place. The Socialist Party tied with 25 seats vs 25 for the People's Party (out of 54), but narrowly won in popular vote. Although Jos\u00e9 Borrell was the official candidate, Zapatero played an important role in that campaign (as is usual in Spain).\n\n\n\n## Premiership[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Styles of**Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero** |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) |\n| Reference style | *Excelent\u00edsimo Se\u00f1or (Don)* |\n| Spoken style | *Se\u00f1or Presidente* |\n| Alternative style | *Se\u00f1or* Zapatero, *Don* Jos\u00e9 Luis |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPreviously, on 8 January 2004, Zapatero had created a Committee of Notables composed of 10 highly qualified experts with considerable political weight. Its mission was to help him to become prime minister. Among its members: Jos\u00e9 Bono (his ex-rival for the Secretaryship of the party and later appointed Minister of Defence), Juan Carlos Rodr\u00edguez Ibarra (president of the regional government of Extremadura and one of the most important socialist leaders), Miguel \u00c1ngel Moratinos (his minister of foreign affairs 2004\u20132010), Gregorio Peces-Barba (later appointed by him High Commissioner for the Victims of Terrorism, although he has already made public his resignation), Carmen Calvo (later appointed minister of culture), etc.[59]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTen days later, on 18 January 2004, Zapatero announced that he would only become prime minister if the Spanish Socialist Workers Party received a plurality, renouncing possible parliamentary alliances in advance if that situation did not happen after the election. Minority parties (especially United Left, a communist party) criticized the decision, for they considered it an attempt to attract their own voters, who would rather ensure a defeat of the People's Party even at the expense of voting for an unfavorable party.[60]\n\n\nZapatero's slogan became \"we deserve a better Spain\", which was coupled with \"Zapatero Presidente\", or \"(ZP)\", which became a popular nickname of the then Spanish Prime Minister.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Party political offices\n |\n| --- |\n| **Vacant**Title last held by\n**Joaqu\u00edn Almunia**  |  **Secretary-General of theSpanish Socialist Workers' Party** 2000\u20132012\n | Succeeded\u00a0byAlfredo P\u00e9rez Rubalcaba\n |\n| Political offices\n |\n| **Vacant**Title last held by\n**Joaqu\u00edn Almunia**  |  **Leader of the Opposition** 2000\u20132004\n | Succeeded\u00a0byMariano Rajoy\n |\n| Preceded\u00a0byJos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar\n |  **Prime Minister of Spain** 2004\u20132011\n |\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nSpanish Socialist Workers' Party\n |\n| --- |\n| Leadership | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter becoming Secretary General, he was congratulated by the French PM Lionel Jospin, by the German Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der and by Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar.[36]\n\n\nHe moved to Madrid with his family that year. As a Congressman he had lived from Monday to Thursday in Madrid and the rest of the time in Le\u00f3n.[37]\n\n\n\n### Opposition leader[edit]\n\n\nThis was the period when Zapatero was appointed as Secretary General of the PSOE in 2000 until he became Prime Minister of Spain on 14 March 2004.\n\n\nZapatero has always claimed to base his political activity on his love of dialogue. When he was an opposition leader, he liked to contrast his behaviour with the \"arrogant\", \"authoritarian\" approach of the People's Party and, especially, that of its leader Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nPrime ministers of Spain\n |\n| --- |\n| Acting prime ministers shown in *italics*.\n |\n| Queen Isabella II(1833\u20131868) | * Mart\u00ednez de la Rosa\n* Toreno\n* \u00c1lava\n* \u00c1lvarez Mendiz\u00e1bal\n* Ist\u00fariz\n* *Calatrava*\n* Espartero\n* Bardaj\u00ed\n* Heredia-Sp\u00ednola\n* Fr\u00edas\n* *Alaix*\n* P\u00e9rez de Castro\n* A.

The People's Party, led in Galicia by Manuel Fraga Iribarne, obtained a new absolute majority. The Socialist party increased its number of seats from 15 to 17, but, after several years of opposition the results were also considered bad.[48] These two negative results seemed to confirm that Zapatero's approach was not working.\n\n\nOn 19 December 2001 Zapatero travelled to Morocco, after the Moroccan government expelled the Spanish ambassador sine die. Javier Arenas, then secretary general of the People's Party, accused him of not being loyal to Spanish interests. Zapatero denied it and claimed that one of his purposes was to help solve the crisis.[49]\n\n\nIn 2002, Zapatero was chosen as the Socialist candidate for the next general election.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| The Restoration(1874\u20131931) | * C\u00e1novas\n* Jovellar\n* Mart\u00ednez Campos\n* Sagasta\n* Posada\n* *Azc\u00e1rraga*\n* Silvela\n* Fern\u00e1ndez-Villaverde\n* Maura\n* Montero\n* Moret\n* L\u00f3pez Dom\u00ednguez\n* Vega de Armijo\n* Canalejas\n* Garc\u00eda Prieto\n* Romanones\n* Dato\n* Maura\n* S\u00e1nchez de Toca\n* *Bugallal*\n* S\u00e1nchez-Guerra\n* Primo de Rivera\n* Berenguer\n* Aznar-Caba\u00f1as\n |\n| Second Republic(1931\u20131939) | * Alcal\u00e1-Zamora\n* Aza\u00f1a\n* Lerroux\n* Mart\u00ednez Barrio\n* Samper\n* Chapaprieta\n* Portela\n* Barc\u00eda\n* Casares\n* Mart\u00ednez Barrio\n* Giral\n* Largo\n* Negr\u00edn\n |\n| Spain under Franco(1936\u20131975) | * Franco\n* Carrero Blanco\n* *Fern\u00e1ndez-Miranda*\n* Arias\n |\n| Since 1975 | * Arias\n* *Santiago*\n* Su\u00e1rez\n* Calvo-Sotelo\n* F.

In reply, both Jos\u00e9 Blanco and Alfredo P\u00e9rez Rubalcaba broke the silence from the Socialist Party's side, in separate appearances. In the end both sides accused each other of breaking the electoral law on reflection day.\n\n\nIn this climate of social unrest and post-attack shock, the elections were held on 14 March 2004. Zapatero's Socialist Party won the elections, with 164 seats in the Cortes, while the People's Party obtained 148. It seems likely that the election result was influenced to a greater or lesser extent by the Spanish public's response to the attacks[68] and the informative coverage by the different media and political parties. He took office on 17 April.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring the Debate over the State of the Nation, an annual debate that takes place in the Spanish Congress of Deputies, Zapatero was harshly criticised by Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar on account of the scandal. For the first time, the opinion polls showed that most Spaniards believed that the then Spanish Prime Minister had been the winner (Zapatero had always been considered the winner since his first debate in 2001).\n\n\nLater, in October, a regional election took place in Catalonia, whose results were worse than expected for the Socialist Party. As most of the Autonomous communities of Spain hold the elections to their assemblies the same day, with the exception of Andalusia, Catalonia, Galicia and the Basque Country, coinciding with the municipal elections all over Spain, the results are hugely significant.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Constituency | Madrid |\n| **In office**9 July 1986\u00a0\u2013 2 August 2004 |\n| Constituency | Le\u00f3n |\n|  |\n| Personal details |\n| Born |  (1960-08-04) 4 August 1960 (age\u00a063)Valladolid, Castile and Le\u00f3n, Spain |\n| Political party | PSOE (since 1979) |\n| Spouse | \nSonsoles Espinosa\n\n\u200b\n \u200b\n(m.\u00a01990)\u200b\n |\n| Children | 2 |\n| Alma mater | University of Le\u00f3n |\n| Signature | ![](image) |\n|  |\n\n\n**Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero** (Spanish: [xose\u02c8lwis ro\u02c8\u00f0\u027ei\u0263e\u03b8 \u03b8apa\u02c8te\u027eo] \u24d8;[1] born 4 August 1960) is a Spanish politician and member of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE). He was the Prime Minister of Spain being elected for two terms, in the 2004 and 2008 general elections.[2] On 2 April 2011 he announced he would not stand for re-election in the 2011 general election and left office on 21 December 2011.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nZapatero condemned the 2006 Lebanon War. Zapatero issued a statement saying that \"From my point of view, Israel is wrong. One thing is self defense, and the other is to launch a counter offensive consisting on a general attack in Lebanon and Gaza that is just going to further escalate violence in the area\".[109][110]\n\n\n\n### 2008 election[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Spanish general election, 2008\n\nOn 9 March 2008, Zapatero's Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) won the general election with 44% of the votes.[111] Two days earlier, on 7 March, Isa\u00edas Carrasco, a PSOE Basque politician was shot dead in what is believed to be an attack by ETA, and which resulted in the agreed canceling of the final days of the campaign.[112][113]\n\n\n\n## Post-Premiership[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHis style's defining word is *(buen) talante*, roughly \"pleasantness\", \"niceness\" or \"good disposition\", which is in brisk and carefully chosen contrast with the more confrontational and brusque premiership style of previous Prime Minister Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar. Similarly, Zapatero has been quoted to shy away from adopting unpopular measures, having a \"habit of showering public money on any problem\" and, in all, being \"averse to tough decisions\".[71]\n\n\n\n### Withdrawal from Iraq[edit]\n\n\nOne of the first measures he carried out as soon as he took office was to withdraw every Spanish soldier fighting in Iraq, calling the invasion of that country \"an error based on lies\".[72] In less than a month, his nation's 1,300 troops were withdrawn from Iraq. This drew criticism from the right, who held the view that he was ceding to the pressure of the terrorists who attacked Spain. However, it was a measure announced by him before the general elections and supported by the majority of Spanish population.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Zapatero in the WorldPride 2017 \u2013 Madrid Summit\nHe left office on 20 December 2011[114] and left the PSOE's Secretary General chair on 4 February 2012 to Alfredo P\u00e9rez Rubalcaba.[115] On 9 February 2012 he took up a role as a member of the Council of State.[116][117] He left the Council of State in 2015 in order to become the President of the Advisory Board of the Institute for Cultural Diplomacy,[118] a Berlin-based organization trying to foster intercultural relations.[119]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* ![](image)Media from Commons\n* ![](image)Quotations from Wikiquote\n\n### Official[edit]\n\n\n* Spanish Socialist Workers' Party\n* Appearances on C-SPAN (2004\u20132005)\n* Appearances on C-SPAN (2009\u20132010)\n* Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero at IMDb\n* Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero collected news and commentary at *The Guardian*\n* Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero collected news and commentary at *The New York Times*\n\n\n### Press[edit]\n\n\n* News and Videos *ABC.es* (in Spanish)\n* \"The second transition, a survey of Spain\" *The Economist*, 24 June 2004\n* Interview *Time*, 19 September 2004\n* \"Accidental Prime Minister\" *The Times*\n* Extended biography Archived 21 March 2009 at the Wayback Machine by CIDOB Foundation (in Spanish)\n* Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero Biography\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAt end of 2003 and the beginning of 2004 the Spanish political parties started to prepare themselves for the general election of 2004.

A member of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), she previously served as Leader of the Opposition from 2002 to 2005 and as Leader of the Christian Democratic Union from 2000 to 2018.[9] Merkel was the first female chancellor of Germany.[b] During her chancellorship, Merkel was frequently referred to as the *de facto* leader of the European Union (EU) and the most powerful woman in the world. Beginning in 2016, she was often described as the leader of the free world.[13]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nFourth Merkel cabinet (2018\u20132021)\n |\n| --- |\n| * **Angela

CDU/CSU, leading to a stalemate.[163][164] The German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier subsequently appealed successfully to the SPD to change their hard stance against coalition with the CDU/CSU, and the SPD agreed to a third grand coalition with the CDU/CSU.[165] The negotiations leading up to this agreement were the longest in German post-war history, lasting almost six months.[166][167]\n\n\nA YouGov survey published in late December 2017 found that just 36% of all respondents wanted Merkel to stay at the helm until 2021, while half of those surveyed voters called for a change at the top before the end of the legislature.[168]\n\n\nThe Fourth Merkel cabinet was sworn in on 14 March 2018.[169]\n\n\n\n#### 2018 government crisis[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2018

international cooperation, both in the context of the EU and NATO, and the strengthening of transatlantic economic relations. In 2008, Merkel served as president of the European Council and played a central role in the negotiation of the Treaty of Lisbon and the Berlin Declaration. Merkel's governments managed the global 2007\u20132008 financial crisis and the European debt crisis. She negotiated the 2008 European Union stimulus plan, which focused on infrastructure spending and public investment to counteract the Great Recession. In domestic policy, Merkel's *Energiewende* program supported the development of renewable energy sources and eventually phased out the use of nuclear power in Germany. Reforms to the *Bundeswehr*, health care reform, the 2010s European migrant crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic were major issues during her chancellorship. Merkel stepped down as leader of the CDU and did not seek a fifth term as chancellor in the 2021 federal election.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nheld enough seats to form a majority in the Bundestag.[85] A grand coalition between the CDU/CSU and SPD would face the challenge of both parties demanding the chancellorship.[85][86] However, after three weeks of negotiations, the two parties reached a deal for a grand coalition whereby Merkel would become Chancellor and the SPD would hold 8 of the 16 seats in the cabinet.[86] The deal was approved by both parties at party conferences on 14 November 2005.[87]\n\n\nMerkel was elected Chancellor by the majority of delegates (397 to 217) in the newly assembled Bundestag on 22 November 2005, but 51 members of the governing coalition voted against her.[88] Reports at the time indicated that the grand coalition would pursue a mix of policies, some of which differed from Merkel's political platform as leader of the opposition and candidate for Chancellor. The coalition's intent was to cut public spending whilst increasing VAT (from 16 to 19%), social insurance contributions and the top rate of income tax.[89]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFollowing the 2005 federal election, Merkel was elected chancellor, leading a grand coalition consisting of the CDU, the Christian Social Union (CSU), and the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD). She was the first woman to be elected chancellor, and the first chancellor of reunified Germany to have been raised in the former East Germany.[c] In the 2009 federal election, the CDU obtained the largest share of the vote, and Merkel subsequently formed a coalition government with the Free Democratic Party (FDP), an alliance more favourable to the CDU than the grand coalition.[16] In the 2013 federal election, the CDU won a landslide victory and formed a second grand coalition with the SPD, after the FDP lost all of its representation in the Bundestag.[17] In the 2017 federal election, Merkel led the CDU to become the largest party for the fourth time, resulting in the formation of a third grand coalition with the SPD.[18]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Merkel at the signing of the coalition agreement for the 18th election period of the Bundestag, December 2013\nIn the election of September 2013, Merkel won one of the most decisive victories in German history, achieving the best result for the CDU/CSU since reunification and coming within five seats of the first absolute majority in the Bundestag since 1957.[124] However, their preferred coalition partner, the FDP, failed to enter parliament for the first time since 1949, being below the minimum of 5% of second votes required to enter parliament.[17][125]\n\n\nThe CDU/CSU turned to the SPD to form the third grand coalition in postwar German history and the second under Merkel's leadership. The third Cabinet of Angela Merkel was sworn in on 17 December 2013.[126]\n\n\nMerkel scored well in opinion polls on her handling of the recent euro crisis (69% rated her performance as good rather than poor), and her approval rating reached an all-time high of 77% in February 2012 and again in July 2014.[127]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n67. **^** Chase, Jefferson (4 December 2021). \"Bavaria's Christian Social Union: What you need to know\". *dw.com*.

He served as a member of the National Assembly from 2012 to 2017, representing the seventh constituency of Seine-Maritime. After being elected to the presidency on 7 May 2017, Macron appointed him Prime Minister of France. Philippe subsequently appointed his government on 17 May. He was succeeded by Jean Castex before his reelection to the mayorship in Le Havre.\n\n\nAs Prime minister, Philippe oversaw the passage of a package of labour law and taxation system reforms as part of Macron's self-proclaimed 'pro-business' agenda. During his time in office, he also led the controversial police response to the Yellow Vests crisis starting in late 2018, and later became a prominent figure in leading the French government's early response to the COVID-19 pandemic, implementing a 55-day national lockdown starting on 17 March 2020. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n27. **^** \"Edouard Philippe: France will maintain border controls until November\". *POLITICO*. 12 July 2017.

He was confirmed with a vote of 370 against 67.[21] Following the vote, Philippe addressed the parliament, talking about plans to tackle France's debt by raising cigarette tax and cutting spending.[22] Philippe also talked about plans to reduce corporate tax from 33.3% to 25% by 2022.[23] Philippe announced the government's labour reform plan which will give companies more power when it comes to negotiating conditions directly with their employees.[24] Labour reform was one of Macron's biggest election promises and has been seen as the government's biggest economic reform.[25]\n\n\nOn 12 July 2017, Philippe announced a new immigration plan. The plan attempts to speed up asylum claims from fourteen months to six, provide housing for 7,500 refugees by the end of 2019, improve living conditions for minors and deport economic migrants.[26][27] The draft of the law will be introduced in September.[28]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n32. **^** Tristan Quinault-Maupoil (12 September 2021), Pr\u00e9sidentielle: \u00c9douard Philippe \u00absoutiendra\u00bb Emmanuel Macron en 2022 Archived 22 February 2022 at the Wayback Machine *Le Figaro*.\n33. **^** \"School of Law\".

Philippe is a member of The Republicans though he campaigned for La R\u00e9publique En Marche! due to the party supporting his role as Prime Minister. He formed the Second Philippe government on 21 May 2017 following a series of resignations after scandal embroiled Ministers Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou, Sylvie Goulard, Marielle de Sarnez and Richard Ferrand.
