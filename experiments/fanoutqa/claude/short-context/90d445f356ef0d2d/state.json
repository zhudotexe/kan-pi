Its cast includes Lee Jung-jae, Park Hae-soo, Wi Ha-joon, HoYeon Jung, O Yeong-su, Heo Sung-tae, Anupam Tripathi and Kim Joo-ryoung.\n\n\nThe series revolves around a secret contest where 456 players, all of whom are in deep financial hardship, risk their lives to play a series of deadly children's games for the chance to win a \u20a945.6 billion prize. The series' title draws from a similarly named Korean children's game. Hwang conceived the idea based on his own economic struggles, as well as the class disparity in South Korea and capitalism. Though he wrote the story in 2009, Hwang couldn't find a production company to fund the idea until Netflix took an interest around 2019 as part of a drive to expand their foreign programming offerings.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Squid Game: the smash-hit South Korean horror is a perfect fit for our dystopian mood\". *the Guardian*.

Its cast includes Lee Jung-jae, Park Hae-soo, Wi Ha-joon, HoYeon Jung, O Yeong-su, Heo Sung-tae, Anupam Tripathi and Kim Joo-ryoung.\n\n\nThe series revolves around a secret contest where 456 players, all of whom are in deep financial hardship, risk their lives to play a series of deadly children's games for the chance to win a \u20a945.6 billion prize. The series' title draws from a similarly named Korean children's game. Hwang conceived the idea based on his own economic struggles, as well as the class disparity in South Korea and capitalism. Though he wrote the story in 2009, Hwang couldn't find a production company to fund the idea until Netflix took an interest around 2019 as part of a drive to expand their foreign programming offerings.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n132. **^** Hayes, Dade (October 21, 2021). \"'Squid Game' Claims U.S. Streaming Crown, With Nielsen Crediting Multicultural Audiences; 'Ted Lasso' Cracks Top 10\". *Deadline Hollywood*.
