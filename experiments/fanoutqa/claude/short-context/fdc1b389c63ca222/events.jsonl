She is scheduled to enter service in early 2024 out of PortMiami in the US.[3] At 250,800 gross tonnage (GT), *Icon of the Seas* will be the largest cruise ship in the world.[2][1]\n\n\n\n\n## History\n\n[edit]\n\nIn October 2016, Royal Caribbean and Finnish shipbuilder Meyer Turku announced an order to build two ships under the project name \"Icon\".[4] The ships are expected to be delivered in the third quarter of 2023 and in 2025.[5][6] The ships will be classified by DNV.[7]\n\n\nRoyal Caribbean applied to register a trademark for \"Icon of the Seas\" in 2016.[8]\n\n\nSteel-cutting for *Icon of the Seas* began in June 2021.[9] In October 2021, Royal Caribbean announced that the first LNG tank for the ship was installed at the Neptun Werft in Rostock, Germany.[10] In December 2021, the floating engine room unit, including the LNG tanks, was towed to Turku in Finland by tug.[11] The keel was laid in April 2022.[12]\nIn May 2022, Royal Caribbean confirmed that *Icon of the Seas* would be bigger than the *Oasis* class.[13]\n\n\nOn 19 June 2023, *Icon of the Seas* sailed for the first of her sea trials.[14] She returned to the Meyer Turku shipyard on 22 June for adjustments to her systems, and interior spaces will be completed and furnished.[15]\n\n\n\n## Design\n\n[edit]\n\n*Icon of the Seas* is powered by liquified natural gas (LNG), with a gross tonnage of 250,800. The ship has six multi-fuel Wärtsilä engines generating 67,500 kW (90,520 hp) of power. The engines can be powered with both LNG and distillate fuel. The ship contains other alternative energy features, like the use of fuel cells to produce electricity and fresh water.[4] *Icon of the Seas* is the first Royal Caribbean vessel to use such technology.[16]\n\n\nThe ship will have a crew of 2,350, and a capacity of 5,610 passengers at double occupancy, or 7,600 passengers at maximum capacity.[2]\n\n\n*Icon of the Seas* has 20 decks with seven swimming pools and six water slides. The company claims the ship has the tallest waterfall, the tallest water slide, the largest waterpark, and the first suspended infinity pool of any ship.[2]\n\n\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Icon of the Seas Ship Details Revealed - Cruise Critic\". *www.cruisecritic.com*.\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** \"Royal Caribbean reveals spectacular design for new Icon of the Seas cruise ship\". *Royal Caribbean Blog*. 20 October 2022.\n3. **^** \"Icon of the Seas | Cruise Ships | Royal Caribbean Cruise\". *Icon of the Seas*.

She was completed in 2022 in the Chantiers de l'Atlantique shipyard in Saint-Nazaire, France,[5] the fifth in Royal Caribbean's *Oasis* class of cruise ships.[6] At 236,857 GT, she was the largest cruise ship in the world by gross tonnage, surpassed by the succeeding ship, *Icon of the Seas*, also owned by Royal Caribbean International.\n\n\n\n\n## Description and design[edit]\n\n\n*Wonder of the Seas* measures 1,188 feet (362 m) in length and has a gross tonnage of 236,857 across 18 decks. This ship accommodates 5,734 passengers at double occupancy or up to a maximum of 6,988 passengers, as well as a 2,300 crew. There are 16 decks for guest use, 20 restaurants, four pools and 2,867 cabins.[4]\n\n\nFacilities include a children's water park, a children's playground, a full-size basketball court, an ice-skating rink, a surf simulator, a zip line that is 10 decks high, a 1,400-seat theater, an outdoor aquatic theater with 30-foot (9.1 m) high platforms, and two 43-foot (13 m) rock-climbing walls.[7][8][9][10][11]\n\n\nAs with all *Oasis*-class ships, one of the special features on board is the Central Park, with more than 10,000 plants and flowers.[12]\n\n\n*Wonder of the Seas* is powered by six marine-diesel sets: two 16-cylinder Wärtsilä 16V46D common rail engines and four 12-cylinder Wärtsilä 12V46D engines.[1]\n\n\nFor propulsion, *Wonder of the Seas* uses three 20,000 kilowatt azipod main engines, which are electric thrusters. These engines are mounted under the stern of the ship and they each drive 20 foot wide rotatable propellers. In addition to the three electric thrusters, there are four bow thrusters used for docking, each with 5,500 kilowatts of power or 7,380 horsepower.[1]\n\n\n\n## Construction and career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*Wonder of the Seas* under construction at Saint-Nazaire in 2020\n![](image)*Wonder of the Seas* in Saint-Nazaire, August 2021\n![](image)*Wonder of the Seas* in Málaga\nOn 25 May 2016, Royal Caribbean Group signed a memorandum of understanding with STX France (now Chantiers de l'Atlantique) for a fifth *Oasis*-class ship for delivery in the spring of 2021.[13] The first steel for the new ship was cut at the Saint-Nazaire shipyard in April 2019,[14] and the vessel's keel was laid on 9 May 2019.[1] Construction cost £1 billion.[15]\n\n\nIn August 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Royal Caribbean announced that delivery of the ship would be delayed until 2022.[16]\n\n\nIn April 2021, Royal Caribbean opened bookings aboard *Wonder of the Seas* for an inaugural 2022 season sailing in Asia from ports in Shanghai and Hong Kong.[17][18] However, in September of that year, Royal Caribbean announced that the ship would instead debut at Port Everglades, sailing Caribbean cruises, before moving to the Mediterranean in the summer, sailing out of Barcelona and Rome.[19] In November 2021, the ship's livery was modified to resemble that of *Odyssey of the Seas*, with her name moved rearward and repainted in larger print.[20] The following month, Royal Caribbean announced that the ship would homeport at Port Canaveral in Florida starting in November 2022.[21]\n\n\nOn 29 October 2021, Royal Caribbean accepted the ship for \"technical delivery\", and the following week she sailed under her own power from Saint-Nazaire to a *Chantier Naval de Marseille* drydock in Marseille-Fos Port for finishing work.[22][23] On 27 January 2022, the ship was handed over to Royal Caribbean.[24][25] She arrived in North America in February 2022,[26] and commenced her maiden voyage on 4 March 2022 out of Port Everglades.[27]\n\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** ***k*** ***l*** ***m*** \"*Wonder of the Seas* (38209)\". *Vessel Register for DNV*.

She is scheduled to enter service in early 2024 out of PortMiami in the US.[3] At 250,800 gross tonnage (GT), *Icon of the Seas* will be the largest cruise ship in the world.[2][1]\n\n\n\n\n## History\n\n[edit]\n\nIn October 2016, Royal Caribbean and Finnish shipbuilder Meyer Turku announced an order to build two ships under the project name \"Icon\".[4] The ships are expected to be delivered in the third quarter of 2023 and in 2025.[5][6] The ships will be classified by DNV.[7]\n\n\nRoyal Caribbean applied to register a trademark for \"Icon of the Seas\" in 2016.[8]\n\n\nSteel-cutting for *Icon of the Seas* began in June 2021.[9] In October 2021, Royal Caribbean announced that the first LNG tank for the ship was installed at the Neptun Werft in Rostock, Germany.[10] In December 2021, the floating engine room unit, including the LNG tanks, was towed to Turku in Finland by tug.[11] The keel was laid in April 2022.[12]\nIn May 2022, Royal Caribbean confirmed that *Icon of the Seas* would be bigger than the *Oasis* class.[13]\n\n\nOn 19 June 2023, *Icon of the Seas* sailed for the first of her sea trials.[14] She returned to the Meyer Turku shipyard on 22 June for adjustments to her systems, and interior spaces will be completed and furnished.[15]\n\n\n\n## Design\n\n[edit]\n\n*Icon of the Seas* is powered by liquified natural gas (LNG), with a gross tonnage of 250,800. The ship has six multi-fuel Wärtsilä engines generating 67,500 kW (90,520 hp) of power. The engines can be powered with both LNG and distillate fuel. The ship contains other alternative energy features, like the use of fuel cells to produce electricity and fresh water.[4] *Icon of the Seas* is the first Royal Caribbean vessel to use such technology.[16]\n\n\nThe ship will have a crew of 2,350, and a capacity of 5,610 passengers at double occupancy, or 7,600 passengers at maximum capacity.[2]\n\n\n*Icon of the Seas* has 20 decks with seven swimming pools and six water slides. The company claims the ship has the tallest waterfall, the tallest water slide, the largest waterpark, and the first suspended infinity pool of any ship.[2]\n\n\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Icon of the Seas Ship Details Revealed - Cruise Critic\". *www.cruisecritic.com*.\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** \"Royal Caribbean reveals spectacular design for new Icon of the Seas cruise ship\". *Royal Caribbean Blog*. 20 October 2022.\n3. **^** \"Icon of the Seas | Cruise Ships | Royal Caribbean Cruise\". *Icon of the Seas*.

She was completed in 2022 in the Chantiers de l'Atlantique shipyard in Saint-Nazaire, France,[5] the fifth in Royal Caribbean's *Oasis* class of cruise ships.[6] At 236,857 GT, she was the largest cruise ship in the world by gross tonnage, surpassed by the succeeding ship, *Icon of the Seas*, also owned by Royal Caribbean International.\n\n\n\n\n## Description and design[edit]\n\n\n*Wonder of the Seas* measures 1,188 feet (362 m) in length and has a gross tonnage of 236,857 across 18 decks. This ship accommodates 5,734 passengers at double occupancy or up to a maximum of 6,988 passengers, as well as a 2,300 crew. There are 16 decks for guest use, 20 restaurants, four pools and 2,867 cabins.[4]\n\n\nFacilities include a children's water park, a children's playground, a full-size basketball court, an ice-skating rink, a surf simulator, a zip line that is 10 decks high, a 1,400-seat theater, an outdoor aquatic theater with 30-foot (9.1 m) high platforms, and two 43-foot (13 m) rock-climbing walls.[7][8][9][10][11]\n\n\nAs with all *Oasis*-class ships, one of the special features on board is the Central Park, with more than 10,000 plants and flowers.[12]\n\n\n*Wonder of the Seas* is powered by six marine-diesel sets: two 16-cylinder Wärtsilä 16V46D common rail engines and four 12-cylinder Wärtsilä 12V46D engines.[1]\n\n\nFor propulsion, *Wonder of the Seas* uses three 20,000 kilowatt azipod main engines, which are electric thrusters. These engines are mounted under the stern of the ship and they each drive 20 foot wide rotatable propellers. In addition to the three electric thrusters, there are four bow thrusters used for docking, each with 5,500 kilowatts of power or 7,380 horsepower.[1]\n\n\n\n## Construction and career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*Wonder of the Seas* under construction at Saint-Nazaire in 2020\n![](image)*Wonder of the Seas* in Saint-Nazaire, August 2021\n![](image)*Wonder of the Seas* in Málaga\nOn 25 May 2016, Royal Caribbean Group signed a memorandum of understanding with STX France (now Chantiers de l'Atlantique) for a fifth *Oasis*-class ship for delivery in the spring of 2021.[13] The first steel for the new ship was cut at the Saint-Nazaire shipyard in April 2019,[14] and the vessel's keel was laid on 9 May 2019.[1] Construction cost £1 billion.[15]\n\n\nIn August 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Royal Caribbean announced that delivery of the ship would be delayed until 2022.[16]\n\n\nIn April 2021, Royal Caribbean opened bookings aboard *Wonder of the Seas* for an inaugural 2022 season sailing in Asia from ports in Shanghai and Hong Kong.[17][18] However, in September of that year, Royal Caribbean announced that the ship would instead debut at Port Everglades, sailing Caribbean cruises, before moving to the Mediterranean in the summer, sailing out of Barcelona and Rome.[19] In November 2021, the ship's livery was modified to resemble that of *Odyssey of the Seas*, with her name moved rearward and repainted in larger print.[20] The following month, Royal Caribbean announced that the ship would homeport at Port Canaveral in Florida starting in November 2022.[21]\n\n\nOn 29 October 2021, Royal Caribbean accepted the ship for \"technical delivery\", and the following week she sailed under her own power from Saint-Nazaire to a *Chantier Naval de Marseille* drydock in Marseille-Fos Port for finishing work.[22][23] On 27 January 2022, the ship was handed over to Royal Caribbean.[24][25] She arrived in North America in February 2022,[26] and commenced her maiden voyage on 4 March 2022 out of Port Everglades.[27]\n\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** ***k*** ***l*** ***m*** \"*Wonder of the Seas* (38209)\". *Vessel Register for DNV*.

One of these is the implementation of a new system that releases tiny air bubbles under the hull to enable the vessel to glide more smoothly through the water.[23] The air layer also reduces excitation from the propellers, which cuts noise and vibration levels in the aft part of the ship.[24]\n\n\n\n## Construction and career[edit]\n\n\nOn 29 October 2015, the vessel's keel was laid by the Chantiers de l'Atlantique shipyard in Saint-Nazaire, France.[5] *Symphony of the Seas* floated out on 9 June 2017.[25] Actors Alexa Vega and Carlos Pena Jr., and their 23-month-old son Ocean were chosen as the \"Godfamily\" of the ship, marking the first time in the industry that a family was a ship sponsor.[26] The christening ceremony took place in Miami in November 2018.[27]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe energy-efficient design of *Symphony of the Seas* requires less shipboard power generation, with 85 MW versus the 100 MW normally found on *Oasis* class ships.[21] One of the key design features is the use of only LED or fluorescent lights in order to avoid the heat generation from incandescent bulbs, thereby reducing the load on air conditioning systems.[21]\n\n\nAdditional energy efficiency is accomplished by using a 2 MW steam turbine to recover waste heat from the engines and converting it into energy to power a portion of the onboard hotel load.[22]\n\n\nFor propulsion, *Symphony of the Seas* uses three 20,000 kilowatt azipod main engines, which are electric thrusters. These engines are mounted under the stern of the ship and they each drive 20 foot wide rotatable propellers. In addition to the three main engines, there are four bow thrusters used for docking, each with 5,500 kilowatts of power or 7,380 horsepower.[20]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2020, Channel 4 in the United Kingdom aired a behind-the-scenes show featuring *Symphony of the Seas* called *Billion Pound Cruise*.[44] The three-part series was filmed at the end of 2019 and covers the on-board experiences*.*[45][46]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nTimeline of largest passenger ships\n |\n| --- |\n| * Briefly held the title before the preceding ship reclaimed it†\n* Shared record‡\n |\n| * SS *Royal William* (1831)\n* SS *Great Western* (1837)\n* SS *British Queen* (1839)\n* SS *President* (1840)†\n* SS *Great Britain* (1843)\n* RMS *Atrato* (1853)\n* SS *Adriatic* (1857)\n* SS *Great Eastern* (1858)\n* SS *City of New York* (1888)\n* RMS *Campania* (1893)‡\n* SS *Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse* (1897)\n* RMS *Oceanic* (1899)\n* RMS *Celtic* (1901)\n* RMS *Cedric* (1903)\n* RMS *Baltic* (1904)\n* RMS *Empress of Scotland* (1906)\n* RMS *Lusitania* (1907)\n* RMS *Mauretania* (1907)\n* RMS *Olympic* (1911)\n* RMS *Titanic* (1912)†\n* SS *Imperator* (1913)\n* SS *Vaterland* (1913)\n* RMS *Majestic* (1922)\n* SS *Normandie* (1935)\n* RMS *Queen Mary* (1936)†\n* RMS *Queen Elizabeth* (1942)\n* SS *France* (1972)\n* MS *Sovereign of the Seas* (1987)†\n* *Sun Princess* (1995)\n* MS *Carnival Destiny* (1996)\n* MS *Grand Princess* (1998)\n* MS *Voyager of the Seas* (1999)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n32. **^** Tribou, Richard (24 March 2018). \"Royal Caribbean takes delivery of world's largest cruise ship\". *Orlando Sentinel*.

Call signs are typically assigned by the ship's flag state and are used for maritime communication, but this information is usually found in maritime databases and official registration documents that I don't have access to.\n\nWould you like me to try to find any other specific information about these ships instead?","name":null,"tool_call_id":null,"tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":null}}
