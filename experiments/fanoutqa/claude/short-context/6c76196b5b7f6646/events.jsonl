Many films that were released during the 20th century do not appear on this list as figures have not been adjusted for inflation, and as a result the films on this list have all had a theatrical run (including re-releases) since 2004. Films that have not played since then do not appear on the chart due to ticket price inflation, population size, and ticket purchasing trends not being considered. If inflation were adjusted for, *Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs* would appear at the top of the chart with an adjusted gross of $1,977,000,000.[2][nb 1] All except two—*The Simpsons Movie* and the original 1994 version of *The Lion King*—are computer-animated films. *Despicable Me* is the most represented franchise with all five films in the top 50 highest-grossing animated films. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe top 48 films listed are also among the 50 highest-grossing animated films and the top 11 are among the 50 highest-grossing films, each having grossed in excess of $1 billion worldwide.\n\n\n\n† *Background shading indicates films playing in the week commencing 7 June 2024 in theaters around the world*.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIncluded in the list are charts of the top box-office earners, a chart of high-grossing animated films by the calendar year, a timeline showing the transition of the highest-grossing animated film record, and a chart of the highest-grossing animated film franchises and series.

It grossed over $1.6 billion worldwide during its theatrical run, breaking several box-office records, including overtaking *Frozen* to become the highest-grossing animated film of all time. It also became the seventh-highest-grossing film of all time and the second-highest-grossing film of 2019, as well as the highest-grossing Disney readaptation to date. Despite the major box office success, *The Lion King* received mixed reviews from critics, with praise for its visual effects, musical score, and vocal performances (particularly Rogen and Eichner), but criticism for its unoriginality and lack of facial emotion on the characters. The film received nominations for Best Animated Feature Film and Original Song categories at the 77th Golden Globe Awards and 25th Critics' Choice Awards. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Academy Awards | February 9, 2020 | Best Visual Effects | Robert Legato, Adam Valdez, Andrew R.

It grossed over $1.6 billion worldwide during its theatrical run, breaking several box-office records, including overtaking *Frozen* to become the highest-grossing animated film of all time. It also became the seventh-highest-grossing film of all time and the second-highest-grossing film of 2019, as well as the highest-grossing Disney readaptation to date. Despite the major box office success, *The Lion King* received mixed reviews from critics, with praise for its visual effects, musical score, and vocal performances (particularly Rogen and Eichner), but criticism for its unoriginality and lack of facial emotion on the characters. The film received nominations for Best Animated Feature Film and Original Song categories at the 77th Golden Globe Awards and 25th Critics' Choice Awards. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n124. **^** \"Animation comes to life in India with box office, streaming success\". *Livemint*.

Favreau was inspired by certain roles of characters in the Broadway adaptation and developed upon elements of the original film's story. Much of the main cast signed in early 2017, and principal photography began in mid-2017 on a blue screen stage in Los Angeles. The \"virtual-reality tools\" utilized in *The Jungle Book*'s cinematography were used to a greater degree during filming of *The Lion King*. Composers Hans Zimmer, Elton John, and lyricist Tim Rice returned to compose the score alongside Knowles-Carter, who assisted John in the reworking of the soundtrack and wrote a new song for the film, titled \"Spirit\", which she also performed. The film serves as the final credit for editor Mark Livolsi who died on September 23, 2018, and it is dedicated to his memory. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n83. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Tartaglione, Nancy (July 21, 2019). \"Cat's Meow: 'The Lion King' Rises To $531M Global In 10 Days; 'Aladdin' & 'Spider-Man' Each Near $1B WW – International Box Office\". *Deadline Hollywood*.

It grossed over $1.6 billion worldwide during its theatrical run, breaking several box-office records, including overtaking *Frozen* to become the highest-grossing animated film of all time. It also became the seventh-highest-grossing film of all time and the second-highest-grossing film of 2019, as well as the highest-grossing Disney readaptation to date. Despite the major box office success, *The Lion King* received mixed reviews from critics, with praise for its visual effects, musical score, and vocal performances (particularly Rogen and Eichner), but criticism for its unoriginality and lack of facial emotion on the characters. The film received nominations for Best Animated Feature Film and Original Song categories at the 77th Golden Globe Awards and 25th Critics' Choice Awards. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nSatellite Award for Best Animated or Mixed Media Feature\n |\n| --- |\n| * *The Hunchback of Notre Dame* (1996)\n* *Men in Black* (1997)\n* *A Bug's Life* (1998)\n* *Toy Story 2* (1999)\n* *Chicken Run* (2000)\n* *The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring* (2001)\n* *Spirited Away* (2002)\n* *The Triplets of Belleville* (2003)\n* *The Incredibles* (2004)\n* *The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe* (2005)\n* *Pan's Labyrinth* (2006)\n* *Ratatouille* (2007)\n* *WALL-E* (2008)\n* *Fantastic Mr. Fox* (2009)\n* *Toy Story 3* (2010)\n* *The Adventures of Tintin* (2011)\n* *Rise of the Guardians* (2012)\n* *The Wind Rises* (2013)\n* *Song of the Sea* (2014)\n* *Inside Out* (2015)\n* *My Life as a Zucchini* (2016)\n* *Coco* (2017)\n* *Isle of Dogs* (2018)\n* *The Lion King* (2019)\n* *Wolfwalkers* (2020)\n* *Encanto* (2021)\n* *Marcel the Shell with Shoes On* (2022)\n* *The Boy and the Heron* (2023)\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n19. **^** Bell, Breanna (July 10, 2019). \"Chance the Rapper Says He Joined 'The Lion King' Cast as a 'Nostalgia Consultant'\". *Variety*.

Favreau was inspired by certain roles of characters in the Broadway adaptation and developed upon elements of the original film's story. Much of the main cast signed in early 2017, and principal photography began in mid-2017 on a blue screen stage in Los Angeles. The \"virtual-reality tools\" utilized in *The Jungle Book*'s cinematography were used to a greater degree during filming of *The Lion King*. Composers Hans Zimmer, Elton John, and lyricist Tim Rice returned to compose the score alongside Knowles-Carter, who assisted John in the reworking of the soundtrack and wrote a new song for the film, titled \"Spirit\", which she also performed. The film serves as the final credit for editor Mark Livolsi who died on September 23, 2018, and it is dedicated to his memory. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n38. **^** \"'Lion King's' Young Simba Actor Signs With ICM Partners (Exclusive)\". *The Hollywood Reporter*.

It is a photorealistic computer-animated remake of Disney's traditionally animated 1994 film of the same name. The film stars the voices of Donald Glover, Seth Rogen, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Alfre Woodard, Billy Eichner, John Kani, John Oliver, Florence Kasumba, Eric André, Keegan-Michael Key, JD McCrary, Shahadi Wright Joseph, with Beyoncé Knowles-Carter, and James Earl Jones (reprising his voice role). The plot follows Simba, a young lion who must embrace his role as the rightful king of his homeland following the murder of his father, Mufasa, at the hands of his uncle, Scar.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n*The Lion King* premiered in Hollywood, Los Angeles on July 9, 2019, and was theatrically released in the United States on July 19, 2019, in the Dolby Cinema, RealD 3D, and IMAX formats. It grossed over $1.6 billion worldwide during its theatrical run, breaking several box-office records, including overtaking *Frozen* to become the highest-grossing animated film of all time. It also became the seventh-highest-grossing film of all time and the second-highest-grossing film of 2019, as well as the highest-grossing Disney readaptation to date. Despite the major box office success, *The Lion King* received mixed reviews from critics, with praise for its visual effects, musical score, and vocal performances (particularly Rogen and Eichner), but criticism for its unoriginality and lack of facial emotion on the characters. The film received nominations for Best Animated Feature Film and Original Song categories at the 77th Golden Globe Awards and 25th Critics' Choice Awards. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n168. **^** Couch, Aaron; Kits, Borys (September 29, 2020). \"'Lion King' Prequel in the Works with Director Barry Jenkins\". *The Hollywood Reporter*.

Favreau was inspired by certain roles of characters in the Broadway adaptation and developed upon elements of the original film's story. Much of the main cast signed in early 2017, and principal photography began in mid-2017 on a blue screen stage in Los Angeles. The \"virtual-reality tools\" utilized in *The Jungle Book*'s cinematography were used to a greater degree during filming of *The Lion King*. Composers Hans Zimmer, Elton John, and lyricist Tim Rice returned to compose the score alongside Knowles-Carter, who assisted John in the reworking of the soundtrack and wrote a new song for the film, titled \"Spirit\", which she also performed. The film serves as the final credit for editor Mark Livolsi who died on September 23, 2018, and it is dedicated to his memory. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n19. **^** Bell, Breanna (July 10, 2019). \"Chance the Rapper Says He Joined 'The Lion King' Cast as a 'Nostalgia Consultant'\". *Variety*.

Disney also did not describe it as live-action, only stating it would follow the \"technologically groundbreaking\" approach of *The Jungle Book*.[23] While the film acts as a remake of the 1994 animated film, Favreau was inspired by the Broadway adaptation of the film for certain aspects of the remake's plot, particularly Nala and Sarabi's roles.[24] Favreau also aimed to develop his own take on the original film's story with what he said was the spectacle of a BBC wildlife documentary.[25]\n\n\nThis serves as the final credit for film editor Mark Livolsi, who died in September 2018.[26] The film is dedicated to him.[1]\n\n\n\n### Casting[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n124. **^** \"Animation comes to life in India with box office, streaming success\". *Livemint*.

It received generally positive reviews from critics and garnered many accolades, including the Best Original Song (\"Let It Go\") and Best Animated Feature at the 86th Academy Awards. The film grossed a total of $1.285 billion in worldwide box office revenue and became the highest-grossing animated film at the time, the highest-grossing film of 2013, and finished its theatrical run as the fifth-highest-grossing film of all time. *Frozen* became a cultural phenomenon with its songs, characters, storytelling elements, and appeal to a general audience. Its popularity inspired the creation of a franchise, which included an animated short in 2015, an animated featurette in 2017, and a feature-length sequel, *Frozen II*, in 2019.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n***Frozen*** is a 2013 American animated musical fantasy film produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Pictures. Produced by Peter Del Vecho, the film was directed by Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee from a screenplay by Lee. The directors co-wrote the story with Shane Morris, drawing inspiration from Hans Christian Andersen's \"The Snow Queen\". It stars the voices of Kristen Bell, Idina Menzel, Josh Gad, Jonathan Groff, and Santino Fontana. *Frozen* follows Princess Anna as she teams up with Kristoff, Sven, and Olaf to find her estranged sister Elsa, whose icy powers have inadvertently trapped their kingdom in eternal winter. The film explores the themes of feminism, social identities, and sisterly bonds.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n*Frozen* debuted with the previews of the songs at the 2013 D23 Expo, where Idina Menzel performed \"Let It Go\" live.[134] Disney parks, including Disneyland, Disney California Adventure, and Epcot featured extensive promotions for the film.[135][136] Theme parks offered meet-and-greet sessions with Anna and Elsa cosplayers.[137] Disney Consumer Products launched a merchandise line ranging from toys to home décor on November 6, 2013.[138] A teaser trailer was released on June 18, 2013,[139] followed by the official trailer on September 26, 2013.[140]\n\n\n*Frozen* was released theatrically in the US on November 27, 2013, and it was accompanied by a Mickey Mouse animated short film, *Get a Horse!*.[141] The film premiered at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on November 19, 2013,[142] and had a five-day limited release there, starting from November 22, before going into wide release.[143][144] Various sing-along versions of *Frozen* were released internationally.[145][146]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAccording to Josh Gad, he became involved with the film during its early stages when the plot closely resembled the original Andersen fairy tale, and Megan Mullally was set to voice Elsa.[45] In early 2010, the project entered a period of development challenges where the studio struggled to make \"The Snow Queen\" story work.[46]\n\n\nOn December 22, 2011, Disney revealed a new title for the film, *Frozen*, and set a release date for November 27, 2013. A month later, Disney announced that the film would be computer-animated instead of the initially planned traditional animation.[47] Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez joined the project and started writing songs for *Frozen* in January 2012.[48]: 44:00 On March 5, 2012, it was announced that Buck would be directing, with Lasseter and Peter Del Vecho producing.[49] Lasseter was later credited as executive producer.[1]\n\n\n\n### Writing[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Frozen |\n| --- |\n| ![The main characters submerged in snow, with Olaf detaching his head](image)Theatrical release poster\n |\n| Directed by | * Chris Buck\n* Jennifer Lee\n |\n| Screenplay by | Jennifer Lee |\n| Story by | * Chris Buck[1]\n* Jennifer Lee[1]\n* Shane Morris[1]\n |\n| Produced by | Peter Del Vecho |\n| Starring | * Kristen Bell\n* Idina Menzel\n* Jonathan Groff\n* Josh Gad\n* Santino Fontana\n |\n| Cinematography | Mohit Kallianpur |\n| Edited by | Jeff Draheim |\n| Music by | * Christophe Beck (score)\n* Robert Lopez (songs)\n* Kristen Anderson-Lopez (songs)\n |\n| Layouts by | Scott Beattie |\n| Productioncompanies\n | * Walt Disney Pictures\n* Walt Disney Animation Studios\n |\n| Distributed by | Walt Disney StudiosMotion Pictures |\n| Release dates\n | * November 19, 2013 (2013-11-19) (El Capitan Theatre)\n* November 27, 2013 (2013-11-27) (United States)\n |\n| Running time\n | 102 minutes[2] |\n| Country | United States |\n| Language | English |\n| Budget | $150 million[3][4] |\n| Box office | $1.285 billion[4] |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n20. **^** \"Olaf\". *Frozen*.
