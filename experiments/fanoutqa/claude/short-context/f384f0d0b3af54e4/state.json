It has a mass that amounts to 1.2% of Earth's, and a diameter that is roughly one-quarter of Earth's or with 3,474\u00a0km (2,159\u00a0mi) about as wide as Australia.[17] Within the Solar System it is the most massive and largest satellite in relation to its parent planet, the fifth most massive and largest moon overall, and more massive and larger than all known dwarf planets.[18] Its surface gravity is about one sixth of Earth's, about half of that of Mars, and after Jupiter's moon Io the second highest among all Solar System moons. The body of the Moon is differentiated and terrestrial, with no significant hydrosphere, atmosphere, or magnetic field. It formed 4.51\u00a0billion years ago, not long after Earth's formation, out of the debris from a giant impact between Earth and a hypothesized Mars-sized body called Theia.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n3. **^** The *maximum value* is given based on scaling of the brightness from the value of \u221212.74 given for an equator to Moon-centre distance of 378\u00a0000\u00a0km in the NASA factsheet reference to the minimum Earth\u2013Moon distance given there, after the latter is corrected for Earth's equatorial radius of 6\u00a0378\u00a0km, giving 350\u00a0600\u00a0km. The *minimum value* (for a distant new moon) is based on a similar scaling using the maximum Earth\u2013Moon distance of 407\u00a0000\u00a0km (given in the factsheet) and by calculating the brightness of the earthshine onto such a new moon. The brightness of the earthshine is [ Earth albedo \u00d7 (Earth radius / Radius of Moon's orbit)2\u00a0] relative to the direct solar illumination that occurs for a full moon. (Earth albedo = 0.367; Earth radius = (polar radius\u00a0\u00d7 equatorial radius)\u00bd = 6 367 km.)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)A view of the rotating Earth and the far side of the Moon as the Moon passes on its orbit in between the observing DSCOVR satellite and Earth\nThe Earth and the Moon form the Earth-Moon satellite system with a shared center of mass, or barycenter. This barycenter is 1,700\u00a0km (1,100\u00a0mi) (about a quarter of Earth's radius) beneath the Earth's surface.\n\n\nThe Moon's orbit is slightly elliptical, with an orbital eccentricity of 0.055.[1]\nThe semi-major axis of the geocentric lunar orbit, called the Lunar distance, is approximately 400,000\u00a0km (250,000 miles or 1.28 light-seconds), comparable to going around Earth 9.5 times.[166]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe **Moon** is Earth's only natural satellite. It orbits at an average distance of 384400\u00a0km (238900\u00a0mi), about 30 times the planet's diameter. The Moon always presents the same side to Earth, because gravitational pull has locked its rotation to the planet. This results in the lunar day of 29.5 days matching the lunar month. The Moon's gravitational pull\u00a0\u2013 and to a lesser extent the Sun's\u00a0\u2013 are the main drivers of the tides.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Moon is the second-densest satellite in the Solar System, after Io.[76] However, the inner core of the Moon is small, with a radius of about 350 kilometres (220\u00a0mi) or less,[1] around 20% of the radius of the Moon. Its composition is not well understood, but is probably metallic iron alloyed with a small amount of sulfur and nickel; analyses of the Moon's time-variable rotation suggest that it is at least partly molten.[77] The pressure at the lunar core is estimated to be 5\u00a0GPa (49,000\u00a0atm).[78]\n\n\n\n### Gravitational field[edit]\n\n\n![](image)An astronaut jumping on the Moon, illustrating that the gravitational pull of the Moon is approximately 1/6 of Earth's.\nOn average the Moon's surface gravity is 1.62\u00a0m/s2[4] (0.1654\u00a0g; 5.318\u00a0ft/s2), about half of the surface gravity of Mars and about a sixth of Earth's.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Moon's internal structure: solid inner core (iron-metallic), molten outer core, hardened mantle and crust. The crust on the Moon's near side permanently facing Earth is thinner, featuring larger areas flooded by material of the once molten mantle forming today's lunar mare.\nThe Moon is a differentiated body that was initially in hydrostatic equilibrium but has since departed from this condition.[71] It has a geochemically distinct crust, mantle, and core. The Moon has a solid iron-rich inner core with a radius possibly as small as 240 kilometres (150\u00a0mi) and a fluid outer core primarily made of liquid iron with a radius of roughly 300 kilometres (190\u00a0mi). Around the core is a partially molten boundary layer with a radius of about 500 kilometres (310\u00a0mi).[72][73] This structure is thought to have developed through the fractional crystallization of a global magma ocean shortly after the Moon's formation 4.5\u00a0billion years ago.[74]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n6. **^** With 27% the diameter and 60% the density of Earth, the Moon has 1.23% of the mass of Earth. The moon Charon is larger relative to its primary Pluto, but Earth and the Moon are different since Pluto is considered a dwarf planet and not a planet, unlike Earth.\n7. **^** There is no strong correlation between the sizes of planets and the sizes of their satellites.

In the northern hemisphere it appears upside down compared to the view from the southern hemisphere.[186] Sometimes the \"horns\" of a crescent moon appear to be pointing more upwards than sideways. This phenomenon is called a wet moon and occurs more frequently in the tropics.[187]\n\n\nThe distance between the Moon and Earth varies from around 356,400\u00a0km (221,500\u00a0mi) (perigee) to 406,700\u00a0km (252,700\u00a0mi) (apogee), making the Moon's apparent size fluctuate. On average the Moon's angular diameter is about 0.52\u00b0, roughly the same apparent size as the Sun (see \u00a7\u00a0Eclipses). In addition, a purely psychological effect, known as the Moon illusion, makes the Moon appear larger when close to the horizon.[188]\n\n\nDespite the Moon's tidal locking, the effect of libration makes about 59% of the Moon's surface visible from Earth over the course of one month.[168][70]\n\n\n\n### Rotation[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n106. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Martel, L.

It orbits Mars much faster than Mars rotates and completes an orbit in just 7 hours and 39 minutes.[10] As a result, from the surface of Mars it appears to rise in the west, move across the sky in 4 hours and 15 minutes or less, and set in the east, twice each Martian day.\n\n\nPhobos is one of the least reflective bodies in the Solar System, with an albedo of 0.071. Surface temperatures range from about \u22124\u00a0\u00b0C (25\u00a0\u00b0F) on the sunlit side to \u2212112\u00a0\u00b0C (\u2212170\u00a0\u00b0F) on the shadowed side.[11] The notable surface feature is the large impact crater, Stickney, which takes up a substantial proportion of the moon's surface.

Phobos does not have an atmosphere due to its low mass and low gravity.[31] It is one of the least reflective bodies in the Solar System, with an albedo of about 0.071.[32] Infrared spectra show that it has carbon-rich material found in carbonaceous chondrites, and its composition shows similarities to that of Mars' surface.[33] Phobos's density is too low to be solid rock, and it is known to have significant porosity.[34][35][36] These results led to the suggestion that Phobos might contain a substantial reservoir of ice. Spectral observations indicate that the surface regolith layer lacks hydration,[37][38] but ice below the regolith is not ruled out.[39][40]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe orbital motion of Phobos has been intensively studied, making it \"the best studied natural satellite in the Solar System\" in terms of orbits completed.[55] Its close orbit around Mars produces some unusual effects. With an altitude of 5,989\u00a0km (3,721\u00a0mi), Phobos orbits Mars below the synchronous orbit radius, meaning that it moves around Mars faster than Mars itself rotates.[35] Therefore, from the point of view of an observer on the surface of Mars, it rises in the west, moves comparatively rapidly across the sky (in 4 h 15 min or less) and sets in the east, approximately twice each Martian day (every 11 h 6 min). Because it is close to the surface and in an equatorial orbit, it cannot be seen above the horizon from latitudes greater than 70.4\u00b0. Its orbit is so low that its angular diameter, as seen by an observer on Mars, varies visibly with its position in the sky. Seen at the horizon, Phobos is about 0.14\u00b0 wide; at zenith it is 0.20\u00b0, one-third as wide as the full Moon as seen from Earth. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe density of Phobos has now been directly measured by spacecraft to be 1.887 g/cm3.[27] Current observations are consistent with Phobos being a rubble pile.[27] In addition, images obtained by the *Viking* probes in the 1970s clearly showed a natural object, not an artificial one. Nevertheless, mapping by the *Mars Express* probe and subsequent volume calculations do suggest the presence of voids and indicate that it is not a solid chunk of rock but a porous body.[28] The porosity of Phobos was calculated to be 30% \u00b1 5%, or a quarter to a third being empty.[29]\n\n\n\n## Physical characteristics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n*Top:* The impact crater Stickney imaged by the *Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter* in March 2008.

The fraction of the mass of Phobos that will form the ring depends on the unknown internal structure of Phobos. Loose, weakly bound material will form the ring. Components of Phobos with strong cohesion will escape tidal breakup and will enter the Martian atmosphere.[61]\n\n\n\n## Origin[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAnother hypothesis is that Mars was once surrounded by many Phobos- and Deimos-sized bodies, perhaps ejected into orbit around it by a collision with a large planetesimal.[69] The high porosity of the interior of Phobos (based on the density of 1.88 g/cm3, voids are estimated to comprise 25 to 35 percent of Phobos's volume) is inconsistent with an asteroidal origin.[29] Observations of Phobos in the thermal infrared suggest a composition containing mainly phyllosilicates, which are well known from the surface of Mars. The spectra are distinct from those of all classes of chondrite meteorites, again pointing away from an asteroidal origin.[70] Both sets of findings support an origin of Phobos from material ejected by an impact on Mars that reaccreted in Martian orbit,[71] similar to the prevailing theory for the origin of Earth's moon.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n112. **^** Lee, Pascal; Braham, Stephen; Mungas, Greg; Silver, Matt; Thomas, Peter C.; and West, Michael D.

Some key facts about Phobos:\n\n1. Orbit and Movement:\n- It orbits very close to Mars, just 6,000 km from the Martian surface\n- It completes an orbit every 7 hours and 39 minutes\n- It moves faster than Mars rotates, causing it to appear to rise in the west and set in the east\n\n2. Physical Characteristics:\n- It's irregularly shaped\n- Has very low reflectivity (albedo of 0.071)\n- Surface temperatures range from -4\u00b0C on the sunlit side to -112\u00b0C on the shadowed side\n- The most prominent feature is the Stickney crater, which is about 9 km in diameter\n- It's believed to be a rubble pile held together by a thin crust\n\n3. Composition and Structure:\n- Density is 1.861 g/cm\u00b3\n- Has significant porosity (30% \u00b1 5% of its volume is empty space)\n- Shows similarities to Mars' surface composition\n- Contains carbon-rich material similar to carbonaceous chondrites\n\n4. Future:\n- It's getting closer to Mars by about 2 cm per year\n- Scientists predict it will either collide with Mars or break up into a planetary ring within 30-50 million years\n\nPhobos was discovered in 1877 by American astronomer Asaph Hall and is named after the Greek god of fear and panic.",

The next planned mission to the Jovian system is the European Space Agency's Jupiter Icy Moon Explorer (JUICE), which was launched in 2023.[27] After flybys of all three icy Galilean moons, it is planned to enter orbit around Ganymede.[28]\n\n\n\n![](image)Size comparison of Earth, the Moon (top left), and Ganymede (bottom left)\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Ganymede from *Pioneer 10* (1973)\nThe first spacecraft to approach close to Ganymede was *Pioneer 10*, which performed a flyby in 1973 as it passed through the Jupiter system at high speed. *Pioneer 11* made a similar flyby in 1974.[26] Data sent back by the two spacecraft was used to determine the moon's physical characteristics[107] and provided images of the surface with up to 400\u00a0km (250\u00a0mi) resolution.[108] Pioneer 10's closest approach was 446,250\u00a0km, about 85 times Ganymede's diameter.[109]\n\n\n*Voyager 1* and *Voyager 2* both studied Ganymede when passing through the Jupiter system in 1979. Data from those flybys were used to refine the size of Ganymede, revealing it was larger than Saturn's moon Titan, which was previously thought to have been bigger.[110] Images from the *Voyagers* provided the first views of the moon's grooved surface terrain.[111]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n## External links[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Ganymede (moon).\n\n* Ganymede page at NASA's Solar System Exploration site\n* Ganymede page at *The Nine Planets*\n* Ganymede page at *Views of the Solar System*\n* Ganymede Crater Database from the Lunar and Planetary Institute\n* Images of Ganymede at JPL's Planetary Photojournal\n* Movie of Ganymede's rotation from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\n* Ganymede map from *Scientific American* article\n* Ganymede map with feature names from Planetary Photojournal\n* Ganymede nomenclature and Ganymede map with feature names from the USGS planetary nomenclature page\n* Paul Schenk's 3D images and flyover videos of Ganymede and other outer solar system satellites\n* Ganymede Orbiter Concept\n* Global Geologic Map of Ganymede (USGS)\n* Google Ganymede 3D, interactive map of the moon\n* Video (animation; 4:00): Flyby of Ganymede and Jupiter (NASA; July 15, 2021).\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nGanymede\n |\n| --- |\n| Geology | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGanymede is composed of silicate rock and water in approximately equal proportions. It is a fully differentiated body with an iron-rich, liquid core, and an internal ocean that potentially contains more water than all of Earth's oceans combined.[17][18][19][20] Its surface is composed of two main types of terrain. Dark regions, saturated with impact craters and dated to four billion years ago, cover about a third of it. Lighter regions, crosscut by extensive grooves and ridges and only slightly less ancient, cover the remainder. The cause of the light terrain's disrupted geology is not fully known, but was likely the result of tectonic activity due to tidal heating.[8] Ganymede orbits Jupiter in roughly seven days and is in a 1:2:4 orbital resonance with the moons Europa and Io, respectively.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n15. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** Hall, D.

This flyby provided images of the moon's polar regions.[115][116] In June 2021, *Juno* performed a second flyby, at a closer distance of 1,038 kilometers (645\u00a0mi).[106][117] This encounter was designed to provide a gravity assist to reduce *Juno'*s orbital period from 53 days to 43 days.

Titan is the tenth-largest object in the solar system, including the Sun. Before the arrival of *Voyager 1* in 1980, Titan was thought to be slightly larger than Ganymede (diameter 5,262 kilometers (3,270\u00a0mi)) and thus the largest moon in the Solar System; this was an overestimation caused by Titan's dense, opaque atmosphere, with a haze layer 100-200 kilometres above its surface. This increases its apparent diameter.[31] Titan's diameter and mass (and thus its density) are similar to those of the Jovian moons Ganymede and Callisto.[32] Based on its bulk density of 1.88\u00a0g/cm3, Titan's composition is half ice and half rocky material. Though similar in composition to Dione and Enceladus, it is denser due to gravitational compression. It has a mass 1/4226 that of Saturn, making it the largest moon of the gas giants relative to the mass of its primary. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTitan is one of the seven gravitationally rounded moons in orbit around Saturn, and the second most distant from Saturn of those seven. Frequently described as a planet-like moon, Titan is 50% larger (in diameter) than Earth's Moon and 80% more massive. It is the second-largest moon in the Solar System after Jupiter's moon Ganymede, and is larger than the planet Mercury, but only 40% as massive.\n\n\nDiscovered in 1655 by the Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens, Titan was the first known moon of Saturn, and the sixth known planetary satellite (after Earth's moon and the four Galilean moons of Jupiter). Titan orbits Saturn at 20 Saturn radii. From Titan's surface, Saturn subtends an arc of 5.09 degrees, and if it were visible through the moon's thick atmosphere, it would appear 11.4 times larger in the sky, in diameter, than the Moon from Earth, which subtends 0.48\u00b0 of arc.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Lorenz, Ralph; Mitton, Jacqueline (2002). *Lifting Titan's Veil: Exploring the Giant Moon of Saturn*.

Christiaan, with the help of his elder brother Constantijn Huygens Jr., began building telescopes around 1650 and discovered the first observed moon orbiting Saturn with one of the telescopes they built.[21] It was the sixth moon ever discovered, after Earth's Moon and the Galilean moons of Jupiter.[22]\n\n\nTitan is the largest and brightest moon of Saturn, and so is the easiest to observe of Saturn's moons with a standard optical telescope from Earth. \n\n\n\n### Naming[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nTitan orbits Saturn once every 15 days and 22 hours. Like Earth's Moon and many of the satellites of the giant planets, its rotational period (its day) is identical to its orbital period; Titan is tidally locked in synchronous rotation with Saturn, and permanently shows one face to the planet. Longitudes on Titan are measured westward, starting from the meridian passing through this point.[29] Its orbital eccentricity is 0.0288, and the orbital plane is inclined 0.348 degrees relative to the Saturnian equator,[6] and hence also about a third of a degree off of the equatorial ring plane. Viewed from Earth, Titan reaches an angular distance of about 20 Saturn radii (just over 1,200,000 kilometers (750,000\u00a0mi)) from Saturn and subtends a disk 0.8 arcseconds in diameter.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nTitan is the largest moon of Saturn and second largest moon in our solar system\n\nNot to be confused with Titania (moon) or Triton (moon).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n40. **^** Zebker, H.
