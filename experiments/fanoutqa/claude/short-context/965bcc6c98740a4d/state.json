Continents are generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria. A continent could be a single landmass or a part of a very large landmass, as in the case of Asia or Europe. Due to this, the number of continents varies; up to seven or as few as four geographical regions are commonly regarded as continents. Most English-speaking countries recognize seven regions as continents. In order from largest to smallest in area, these seven regions are Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia.[1] Different variations with fewer continents merge some of these regions; examples of this are merging North America and South America into America, Asia and Europe into Eurasia, and Africa, Asia, and Europe into Afro-Eurasia.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn some non-English-speaking countries, such as China, Poland, and Russia, Oceania is considered a proper continent because their equivalent word for \"continent\" has a rather different meaning which can be interpreted as \"a major division of land including islands\" (leaning towards a region) rather than \"land associated with a large landmass\" (leaning towards a landmass).[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Area and population\n\n[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a more detailed list of populations by continental regions and subregions, see List of continents and continental subregions by population.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n44. **^** \"Continents\".

In the mid-17th century, Peter Heylin wrote in his *Cosmographie* that \"A Continent is a great quantity of Land, not separated by any Sea from the rest of the World, as the whole Continent of Europe, Asia, Africa.\" In 1727, Ephraim Chambers wrote in his *Cyclop\u00e6dia,* \"The world is ordinarily divided into two grand continents: the old and the new.\" And in his 1752 atlas, Emanuel Bowen defined a continent as \"a large space of dry land comprehending many countries all joined together, without any separation by water. Thus Europe, Asia, and Africa is one great continent, as America is another.\"[95] However, the old idea of Europe, Asia and Africa as \"parts\" of the world ultimately persisted with these being regarded as separate continents.\n\n\n\n### Beyond four continents\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIf continents are defined strictly as discrete landmasses, embracing all the contiguous land of a body, then Africa, Asia, and Europe form a single continent which may be referred to as Afro-Eurasia.[17] Combined with the consolidation of the Americas, this would produce a four-continent model consisting of Afro-Eurasia, America, Antarctica, and Australia.\n\n\nWhen sea levels were lower during the Pleistocene ice ages, greater areas of continental shelf were exposed as dry land, forming land bridges between Tasmania and the Australian mainland.[18] At those times, Australia and New Guinea were a single, continuous continent known as Sahul. Likewise, Afro-Eurasia and the Americas were joined by the Bering Land Bridge. Other islands, such as Great Britain, were joined to the mainlands of their continents. At that time, there were just three discrete landmasses in the world: Africa-Eurasia-America, Antarctica, and Australia-New Guinea (Sahul).\n\n\n\n### Number\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
