OPEC decisions have come to play a prominent role in the global oil-market and in international relations. Economists have characterized OPEC as a textbook example of a cartel[5]\n(a group whose members cooperate to reduce market competition) but one whose consultations may be protected by the doctrine of state immunity under international law.[6]\n\n\nCurrent OPEC members are[ref] Algeria, Angola, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, the Republic of the Congo, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela. Meanwhile, Ecuador, Indonesia and Qatar are former OPEC members.[7] A larger group called **OPEC+**, consisting of OPEC members plus other oil-producing countries, formed in late 2016 to exert more control on the global crude-oil market.[8] Canada, Egypt, Norway and Oman are observer states.\n\n\n\n\n## Organization and structure[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring 1961–1975, the five founding nations were joined by Qatar (1961), Indonesia (1962–2008, rejoined 2014–2016), Libya (1962), United Arab Emirates (originally just the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, 1967), Algeria (1969), Nigeria (1971), Ecuador (1973–1992, 2007–2020), and Gabon (1975–1994, rejoined 2016).[37] By the early 1970s, OPEC's membership accounted for more than half of worldwide oil production.[38] Indicating that OPEC is not averse to further expansion, Mohammed Barkindo, OPEC's acting secretary general in 2006, urged his African neighbors Angola and Sudan to join,[39] and Angola did in 2007, followed by Equatorial Guinea in 2017.[40] Since the 1980s, representatives from Canada, Egypt, Mexico, Norway, Oman, Russia, and other oil-exporting nations have attended many OPEC meetings as observers, as an informal mechanism for coordinating policies.[41]\n\n\n\n### 1973–1974: oil embargo[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 1973 oil crisis\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n167. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Field Listing: Area\". *The World Factbook*.

Poorer members have pushed for production cuts from fellow members, to increase the price of oil and thus their own revenues.[98] These proposals conflict with Saudi Arabia's stated long-term strategy of being a partner with the world's economic powers to ensure a steady flow of oil that would support economic expansion.[99] Part of the basis for this policy is the Saudi concern that overly expensive oil or unreliable supply will drive industrial nations to conserve energy and develop alternative fuels, curtailing the worldwide demand for oil and eventually leaving unneeded barrels in the ground.[100] To this point, Saudi Oil Minister Yamani famously remarked in 1973: \"The Stone Age didn't end because we ran out of stones.\"[101]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n33. **^** \"Switzerland Reduces Her Foreign Population\". *The Telegraph*. 29 June 1965.\n34. **^** \"OPEC : Thank you Austria – thank you Vienna!\". *www.opec.org*.

Saudi Arabia is not totalitarian. Travel outside the country is common, political crimes and violence are rare, people are not in constant fear of the police, and the state does not try to take over all existing organizations, such as philanthropic, religious, commercial, and industrial groups. Saudi rulers still see themselves in a parental role, much like a sheikh of a tribe who is in close touch with the concerns of his tribesmen and keeps those concerns in balance.

It is bordered by the Red Sea to the west; Jordan, Iraq, and Kuwait to the north; the Persian Gulf, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates to the east; Oman to the southeast; and Yemen to the south. Bahrain is an island country off its east coast. The Gulf of Aqaba in the northwest separates Saudi Arabia from Egypt and Israel. Saudi Arabia is the only country with a coastline along both the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf, and most of its terrain consists of arid desert, lowland, steppe, and mountains. Saudi Arabia's capital and largest city is Riyadh; the kingdom is also the location of Islam's two holiest cities of Mecca and Medina.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIslamism was not the only source of hostility to the government. Although extremely wealthy by the 21st century, Saudi Arabia's economy was near stagnant. High taxes and a growth in unemployment have contributed to discontent and have been reflected in a rise in civil unrest, and discontent with the royal family. In response, a number of limited reforms were initiated by King Fahd. In March 1992, he introduced the \"Basic Law\", which emphasized the duties and responsibilities of a ruler. In December 1993, the Consultative Council was inaugurated. It is composed of a chairman and 60 members—all chosen by the King. Fahd made it clear that he did not have democracy in mind, saying: \"A system based on elections is not consistent with our Islamic creed, which [approves of] government by consultation [shūrā].\"[75]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_0141qjZbuQy5SACH7x7zLPpb","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

Freedom House rates the country as \"partly free\" in the Freedom in the World survey.[283] The Emir is the head of state.

The emir is the head of state and the Al Sabah is the ruling family which dominates the country's political system. Kuwait's official state religion is Islam, specifically the Maliki school of Sunni Islam. Kuwait is a developing country with a high-income economy, backed by the world's sixth largest oil reserves. Kuwaiti popular culture, in the form of theatre, radio, music, and television soap opera, is regionally influential and exported to neighboring GCC states.[19] In 2009, Kuwait had the highest Human Development Index in the Arab world.[20][21] Kuwait is a founding member of the GCC and is also a member of the UN, AL, OPEC and the OIC. In July 2022, Kuwait named the emir's son as the country's new prime minister to replace caretaker premier Sheikh Sabah al-Khalid, who faced a combative parliament as head of cabinet in a feud hindering fiscal reform.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n312. **^** Nyrop, Richard F.
