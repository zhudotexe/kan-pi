They have not been out of the top tier since 1975, and they have never been lower than the second tier.[1] They have also been involved in European football ever since they became the first English club to enter the European Cup in 1956.[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n126. **^** \"Top Ten: Manchester United shock League defeats\". sport.co.uk.

The club was founded as Newton Heath LYR F.C. in 1878 and turned professional in 1885, before joining the Football League in 1892. After a brush with bankruptcy in 1901, the club reformed as Manchester United in 1902. Manchester United currently play in the Premier League, the top tier of English football. They have not been out of the top tier since 1975, and they have never been lower than the second tier.[1] They have also been involved in European football ever since they became the first English club to enter the European Cup in 1956.[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This article **needs additional citations for verification**.

The club was founded as Newton Heath LYR F.C. in 1878 and turned professional in 1885, before joining the Football League in 1892. After a brush with bankruptcy in 1901, the club reformed as Manchester United in 1902. Manchester United currently play in the Premier League, the top tier of English football. They have not been out of the top tier since 1975, and they have never been lower than the second tier.[1] They have also been involved in European football ever since they became the first English club to enter the European Cup in 1956.[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** ***k*** \"Manchester United\".
