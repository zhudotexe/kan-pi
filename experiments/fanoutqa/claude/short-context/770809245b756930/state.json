The club was founded as Newton Heath LYR F.C. in 1878 and turned professional in 1885, before joining the Football League in 1892. After a brush with bankruptcy in 1901, the club reformed as Manchester United in 1902. Manchester United currently play in the Premier League, the top tier of English football. They have not been out of the top tier since 1975, and they have never been lower than the second tier.[1] They have also been involved in European football ever since they became the first English club to enter the European Cup in 1956.[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n126. **^** \"Top Ten: Manchester United shock League defeats\". sport.co.uk.

The club was founded as Newton Heath LYR F.C. in 1878 and turned professional in 1885, before joining the Football League in 1892. After a brush with bankruptcy in 1901, the club reformed as Manchester United in 1902. Manchester United currently play in the Premier League, the top tier of English football. They have not been out of the top tier since 1975, and they have never been lower than the second tier.[1] They have also been involved in European football ever since they became the first English club to enter the European Cup in 1956.[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This article **needs additional citations for verification**.

According to the article, Thierry Henry is Arsenal's record goalscorer with 228 goals. He broke Ian Wright's previous record in October 2005 after scoring twice against Sparta Prague.\n\nHere are the key points about Arsenal's goalscorers:\n\n1. Thierry Henry - 228 goals (1999-2007, 2012)\n- Was Arsenal's leading goalscorer for seven consecutive seasons from 1999-2000 to 2005-06\n- Holds the record for most goals in a 38-game Premier League season (30 goals in 2003-04)\n\n2. Ian Wright - Previous record holder before Henry\n\nOther notable goalscoring records mentioned:\n- Single season record: Ted Drake - 44 goals (1934-35 season)\n- Most goals in a single match: Ted Drake - 7 goals (vs Aston Villa, December 1935)\n\nLet me search specifically for the complete list of top goalscorers.\n\n\nLet me try one more specific search to find the complete list.\n\n\nBased on the available information from the searches, I can confirm these definitive records:\n\n1. Thierry Henry - 228 goals (1999-2007, 2012)\n2. Ian Wright - (Previous record holder before Henry)\n\nWhile there were certainly other prolific goalscorers in Arsenal's history, like Ted Drake (who holds the single-season record with 44 goals), I cannot provide their exact total goal tallies without having access to the complete historical records. To avoid providing potentially incorrect information, I'll stick to the confirmed numbers we found in our searches.\n\nIf you'd like to know the complete list with exact numbers for other top scorers, you may want to consult Arsenal's official website or other reliable football statistics sources.",

They also reached the final of the UEFA Cup in 2000 and the Europa League in 2019, and became the first London team to appear in a UEFA Champions League final in 2006.[162][163] Despite having never won the UEFA Champions League, Arsenal have set numerous records in the competition. Between the 1998\u201399 and 2016\u201317 seasons, they participated in nineteen successive editions, a record only surpassed in Europe by Real Madrid.[164] Goalkeeper Jens Lehmann kept ten consecutive clean sheets in the run-in to Arsenal's first UEFA Champions League final and the defence went 995 minutes until conceding a goal.[165] Arsenal were also the first British side to defeat Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund away from home, and both Milanese teams: Internazionale and Milan at the San Siro. They were also the first British side to win away to Juventus.[166]\n\n\n\n## Global records[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n93. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** \"Folarin Balogun: Monaco sign Arsenal forward on five-year deal for \u00a335m\". *BBC Sport*. 30 August 2023.
