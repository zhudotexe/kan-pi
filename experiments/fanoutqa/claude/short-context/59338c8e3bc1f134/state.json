This success spans multiple eras from the Soviet period (1952-1988) through to modern Russia, including medals won under various designations (Soviet Union, Unified Team, Russia, Olympic Athletes from Russia, and ROC).\n\nThe dominance in gymnastics is due to:\n1. Consistent success across multiple decades\n2. Multiple medal opportunities in both men's and women's competitions\n3. Success across team events, individual all-around, and apparatus competitions\n4. Strong performances in both the Soviet era and post-Soviet Russian period\n\nWhile other sports like cross-country skiing and speed skating have also been very successful, particularly in Winter Olympics, the total number of gold medals in gymnastics exceeds these due to the greater number of medal opportunities available in gymnastics and the consistent excellence maintained in this sport over many decades.",

This is evidenced by several key facts from the search results:\n\n1. Jason Kenny, a track cyclist, is Great Britain's most successful Olympian with seven gold medals (and two silver medals).\n\n2. His wife Laura Kenny is Britain's most successful female Olympian with five gold medals, also in cycling.\n\n3. The article specifically mentions that of Great Britain's 100 cycling medals, 50 have been won in just four Games since 2008, including 28 gold medals. Prior to 2008, Great Britain had only won ten golds in total between 1896 and 2008.\n\nThis concentration of gold medals, particularly in recent Olympics, makes cycling the sport that has produced the most gold medals for Great Britain. The dominance in cycling is particularly notable with the Kenny family alone accounting for 12 gold medals (7 for Jason and 5 for Laura).",

Usually, a single code corresponds to a single National Olympic Committee (NOC). When different codes are displayed for different years, medal counts are combined in the case of a simple change of IOC code (such as from HOL to NED for the Netherlands) or simple change of country name (such as from Ceylon to Sri Lanka). As the medals are attributed to each NOC, not all totals include medals won by athletes from that country for another NOC, such as before independence of that country. Names in italic are national entities that no longer exist. The totals of NOCs are not combined with those of their predecessors and successors.\n\n\n\n![](image)World map showing nations that have won Summer Olympic medals.\n![](image)World map showing nations that have won Winter Olympic medals.\n\n## List of NOCs with medals (sortable & unranked)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThis article is about Olympic medals by country.

Let me search Wikipedia for Olympic medals of the United States.\n\n\nLet me try searching for the more specific article about the United States at the Olympics.\n\n\nLet me help analyze this information. Based on the Wikipedia article, I can tell you about the United States' most successful Olympic sports in terms of gold medals. While the article doesn't directly state which single sport has the most gold medals, it provides several key insights about the most successful sports for the United States:\n\n1. Swimming has been one of the most dominant sports for the US:\n- In the 1968 Olympics alone, the US swimming team won 51 medals\n- In 1964, the US swimming team won 13 out of 18 available golds\n- In 1972, they won 17 gold medals in swimming\n\n2. Track and Field (Athletics) has also been historically very successful:\n- The US consistently won numerous medals in this sport\n- In 1968, the US won 15 gold medals in track and field\n- Together with swimming, these two sports accounted for more than 70% of US medals in some Olympics\n\n3. Basketball has been another strong sport:\n- The US men's team won seven consecutive gold medals in earlier Olympics\n- They maintained a 63-game winning streak until their first loss\n\nLet me search specifically for a breakdown of medals by sport.\n\n\nBased on the available information from the Wikipedia articles, Athletics (Track and Field) and Swimming have been the United States' most successful Olympic sports throughout history. While the exact total number of gold medals for each sport is not directly stated in the article, these two sports have consistently produced the most medals for the United States at the Olympics. The article specifically mentions that in some Olympics, these two sports combined accounted for more than 70% of all US medals.\n\nThe success in these sports is demonstrated by:\n1. Swimming's dominance: Multiple Olympics where the US won the majority of available gold medals, including complete medal sweeps in some events\n2. Athletics/Track and Field: Consistent strong performances with double-digit gold medal counts in many Olympics\n\nWhile Basketball has also been very successful for the United States, the total number of gold medals is lower since it's a team sport with only one gold medal available per Olympics, compared to the multiple events in swimming and athletics.\n\nUnfortunately, I cannot provide the exact total number of gold medals for each sport, as this specific breakdown is not provided in the Wikipedia articles I accessed. However, it's clear that Athletics (Track and Field) and Swimming are the two sports where the United States has won the most Olympic gold medals throughout history.",

Here's the breakdown of their top 5 sports by gold medals:\n\n1. Gymnastics: 73 gold medals\n2. Athletics (Track and Field): 64 gold medals\n3. Wrestling: 62 gold medals\n4. Weightlifting: 39 gold medals\n5. Canoeing: 29 gold medals\n\nThis data covers the Soviet Union's Olympic participation from 1952 to 1988. The Soviet Union was extremely successful at the Olympics overall, ranking first in total medals at six of its nine Summer Olympic appearances and seven of its nine Winter Olympic appearances. \n\nIt's worth noting that after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the former Soviet republics competed separately or under different designations (such as the Unified Team in 1992, and later as individual countries like Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, etc.). The data presented here is specifically for the Soviet Union period and doesn't include medals won by these successor states.",

Cycling: 15 gold medals\n\nFor Winter Olympics:\n1. Luge: 22 gold medals\n2. Biathlon: 20 gold medals\n3. Bobsleigh: 16 gold medals\n4. Speed skating: 13 gold medals\n5. Alpine skiing: 12 gold medals\n\nTherefore, when considering all Olympic sports across both Summer and Winter Games, Canoeing is the sport in which Germany has won the most gold medals with 34, followed by Equestrian (28) and Rowing (23). However, it's worth noting that Germany has been very successful in Winter sports as well, with Luge (22 golds) and Biathlon (20 golds) rounding out their top performances.\n\nThis data includes medals won by Germany under various designations throughout history, including when it competed as West Germany (FRG) and East Germany (GDR) during the divided years (1968-1988), as well as the United Team of Germany (EUA) from 1956-1964, and as a unified Germany before and after these periods.",

Here are the key points:\n\n1. Cycling Dominance:\n- Of Great Britain's 100 cycling medals, 50 of them (including 28 golds) have been won just since 2008\n- Before 2008, Britain had won only ten golds in cycling between 1896-2008\n- The total of 38 cycling gold medals (28 since 2008 + 10 before) makes it Britain's most successful sport\n\n2. Notable Cycling Achievements:\n- Jason Kenny is Britain's most successful Olympian ever with 7 gold medals and 2 silver medals in cycling\n- Laura Kenny is Britain's most successful female Olympian with 5 gold medals and 1 silver medal in cycling\n- The success in cycling has been particularly concentrated in recent Olympics, showing Britain's modern dominance in the sport\n\nThis conclusion is supported by the fact that while Britain has been successful in many sports, no other sport comes close to these numbers of gold medals. For comparison:\n- Rowing has been successful but even their most decorated athlete, Sir Steve Redgrave, won 5 golds\n- In other sports like athletics, swimming, and sailing, Britain has won medals but not in the same concentration as cycling\n\nTherefore, cycling is definitively Great Britain's most successful Olympic sport in terms of total gold medals won, with a particularly strong showing in the modern era since 2008.",

The United States has sent athletes to every Olympic Games with the exception of the 1980 Summer Olympics, during which it led a boycott in protest of the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan. The United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee (USOPC) is the National Olympic Committee for the United States.\n\n\nAmerican athletes have won a total of 2,629 medals (1,061 of them gold) at the Summer Olympic Games, and another 330 (113 of them gold) at the Winter Olympic Games. This makes the United States the most prolific medal-winning nation in the history of the Olympics. The United States remains one of the only major teams in the world to receive no government funding.[1][2][3][4][5]\n\n\n\n\n## Hosted Games[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe US won medals in 14 sports, finishing third with 34 gold and 94 total medals. The most successful day for the Americans was July 31 when they won 8 gold and 18 total medals.[30]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOverall, the United States (1896\u20131976, 1984\u2013present) has won 1,061 gold and 2,636 total medals, and Russia (1900, 1908\u20131912, 1952\u20141980, 1988\u2013present) has won 610 gold and 1,627 total medals.\n\n\n\n### Winter Olympics[edit]\n\n\nMedal totals of the Soviet Union/Unified Team/Russia/Olympic Athletes from Russia[80][81][82] and the United States[83] since 1956, when the Soviet Union started to compete at the Winter Games.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe 1968 Mexico Olympics became the most successful summer games for the US in the post-war era. American athletes amassed 45 gold and 107 total medals, 16 gold and 16 total medals more than the second-placed Soviets. The US swimming team dominated the competition, winning a staggering 51 medals and sweeping the podium on five occasions. The Americans also managed to medal in every single of 29 swimming events, thus achieving a unique feat. The US track and field team pulled off a stellar performance as well with 15 gold and 28 total medals. Overall, swimming and athletics accounted for more than 70% of all US medals and ensured the first place in the medal table for the Americans, their second consecutive first-place finish in terms of gold medals, and their first finish at the top of the overall medal table since 1952. In other sports, however, the performance of American athletes was less convincing. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| ![](image) Mountain biking | 0 | 0 | 2 | 2 |\n| ![](image) Skateboarding | 0 | 0 | 2 | 2 |\n| ![](image) Karate | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |\n| Totals (47 entries) | 1061 | 829 | 737 | 2627 |\n\n*Updated on December 31, 2021*\n\\**This table does not include two medals \u2013 one silver awarded in the ice hockey and one bronze awarded in the figure skating events at the 1920 Summer Olympics.*\nThe United States has never won an Olympic medal in the following current summer sports or disciplines: badminton, handball, rhythmic gymnastics, table tennis and trampoline gymnastics.\n | Medals by winter sport[edit]\n**Leading in that sport**\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOverall, the United States (1924\u2013present) has won 113 gold and 330 total medals, and Russia (1956\u2013present) has won 142 gold and 376 total medals.\n\n\n\n### Basketball[edit]\n\n\n#### 1972 Olympics[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 1972 Olympic Men's Basketball Final\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section's **tone or style may not reflect the encyclopedic tone used on Wikipedia**.

Particularly successful was the US swimming team that won 13 out of available 18 golds and shattered 9 world records. In track and field, the Americans also improved on their 1960 performance, winning 14 gold and 24 total medals, while the Soviets left Japan with 5 gold and 18 total medals, a significant downturn compared to their 1960 results. The Soviets, however, continued to dominate Olympic weightlifting, and, with the American program falling apart, the USSR produced four golds and three silvers. The Soviet Union hoped to replicate that success in gymnastics and wrestling, the sports that, together with weightlifting, were strongly associated with their athletic prowess. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe United States made its Olympic debut in 1896 in Athens, the very first edition of the modern games. The nation performed inconsistently in the pre-World War-I period, primarily due to fielding considerably fewer athletes than host countries, with the exception being the 1904 Olympics in St. Louis, Missouri, where the U.S. achieved its largest medal haul in history, a record that still stands today. During the interwar period, the U.S. enjoyed its greatest success, topping both gold and total medal counts at four straight Summer Games, before falling short in the 1936 Berlin games. The next summer Olympics were held in 1948 following World War II. In 1952, the Soviet Union made its Olympic debut, initiating a state-sponsored approach to international sport focused on projecting socio-political superiority. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSee also: United States at the Summer Olympics and United States at the Winter Olympics\n\n\n\n\n\nSporting event delegation\n\n\n| United States at theOlympics |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)Flag of the United States\n |\n| IOC code | USA |\n| NOC | United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee |\n| Website | www.teamusa.org |\n| MedalsRanked 1st | \nGold\n1,174\nSilver\n952\nBronze\n833\nTotal\n2,959\n |\n| Summer appearances |\n| * 1896\n* 1900\n* 1904\n* 1908\n* 1912\n* 1920\n* 1924\n* 1928\n* 1932\n* 1936\n* 1948\n* 1952\n* 1956\n* 1960\n* 1964\n* 1968\n* 1972\n* 1976\n* 1980\n* 1984\n* 1988\n* 1992\n* 1996\n* 2000\n* 2004\n* 2008\n* 2012\n* 2016\n* 2020\n* 2024\n |\n| Winter appearances |\n| * 1924\n* 1928\n* 1932\n* 1936\n* 1948\n* 1952\n* 1956\n* 1960\n* 1964\n* 1968\n* 1972\n* 1976\n* 1980\n* 1984\n* 1988\n* 1992\n* 1994\n* 1998\n* 2002\n* 2006\n* 2010\n* 2014\n* 2018\n* 2022\n |\n| Other related appearances |\n| 1906 Intercalated Games |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n10 Soviet golds in gymnastics didn't surprise anyone, as the nation had always been a gymnastics powerhouse, but it did mean that the Soviets beat the Americans in the medal standings for the second straight summer games. The US basketball team, however, met the pre-tournament expectations and won its fifth consecutive gold medal, a noble feat, given that they had to compete against veteran pros from the USSR. The final result, 43 gold and 103 total medals for the Soviets to 34 gold and 71 total medals for the Americans, showed that America was no longer a leading force in Olympic competition.[22]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSo, in 1996, the Americans finally managed to return to the top spot in the medal rankings, winning 44 gold and 101 total medals compared to 26 gold and 63 total medals won by the second-placed Russians, thanks to the partial abolition of the amateur rules in the early 1990s (the American athletes still weren't state-sponsored, unlike their foreign counterparts, but they were now eligible for prize money and sponsorships). They were still disadvantaged by these rules in those sports where they weren't abolished (i.e., boxing, baseball, where Cubans continued to field state-sponsored pros against American amateurs), but the situation started improving.\n\n\n\n### Recent period (1994\u2013present)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | This section **needs expansion**. You can help by adding to it. *(February 2020)*\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe rapid rise of the Soviet Union to challenge the United States as a leading Olympic power raised questions and suspicion about the means used to achieve this, including the pretense of professional athletes having amateur status and allegations of state-sponsored doping. After 20 years of competition on the Olympic stage, the USSR convincingly topped the medal chart at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich. After that, the U.S. would not top the medal table in non-boycotted games until the 1996 Summer Olympics, five years after the USSR collapsed.[9][10] A bright spot for the United States was the 1984 games in Los Angeles, where the U.S. set a record for most gold medals won in a single Olympics (83), buoyed by the Soviet-led boycott. Coincident with a drive by the International Olympic Committee toward gender parity beginning in the 1990s, the U.S.\u2019s fortunes improved, and the nation topped the medal table in the Summer Olympics six times since 1992 and placed second on two occasions.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThat would start a significant controversy, that will result in the amateur rules being abolished, though only in the 1990s, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, meaning that the Soviets benefited from those rules throughout their Olympic history.[18] The United States still topped the medal count at these games, winning 40 gold and 76 total medals, 22 gold and 5 total medals more than the Soviets who finished second. American athletes won 31 medals in track and field, their most successful sport. US basketball team won its third consecutive gold, twice defeating the Soviets in the process, American boxers won all five finals they entered, and American weightlifters edged their Soviet rivals 4 to 3 in terms of gold medals, with the two nations sweeping all seven events in the sport.[19][20]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe US weightlifting team continued to fade away, winning just one medal (compared to 7 in 1956), American boxers won 7 medals, though only two of them gold, US divers won 6 medals, and the men's volleyball team managed to stun the defending champions from the Soviet Union, beating them in five sets, but still finished out of medals; Soviets ultimately won gold, with their lone loss being to the US. In gymnastics, Japan continued to frustrate the Soviets, once again surpassing them in the medal standings. Last but not least, the US basketball team won its seventh consecutive gold medal, a feat not matched by any other Olympic team in ball sports. Very few would have assumed that this was the last time that the US finished first in the medal table in a fully attended Summer Olympics until 1996 (the Americans would top the medal standings in 1984 with the Soviet Union and its satellites boycotting).[24]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nU.S. athletes have appeared in every Summer Olympics in recent decades. The United States, represented by the United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee (USOPC), competed at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. Originally scheduled to take place in the summer of 2020, the Games were postponed to July 23 to August 8, 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[39] The opening ceremony flag-bearers for the United States were baseball player Eddy Alvarez and basketball player Sue Bird.[40] Javelin thrower Kara Winger was the flag-bearer for the closing ceremony.[41] When USA Gymnastics announced that 2016 Olympic all-around champion Biles would not participate in the gymnastics all-around final, the spotlight fell on her American team-mates. The U.S. had won the event in each of the last five Olympic Games: a formidable winning streak was on the line. Sunisa Lee embraced the moment and stood tall to deliver for her country. She totaled 57.433 to hold off Rebeca Andrade of Brazil (57.298) to clinch the title. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWhen a US athlete wins an Olympic medal, as of 2016, the USOPC paid the winner $25,000 for gold, $15,000 for silver, and $10,000 for bronze.[50] The USOPC increased the payouts by 25% to $37,000 for gold, $22,500 for silver, and $15,000 for bronze beginning in 2017.[51] These numbers are significantly lower than in other countries, where Olympic gold medalists receive up to $1 million from their governments for a gold medal.[52][53] Since 2018, payouts to Paralympic athletes have been the same as to the Olympians. The International Paralympic Committee noted that \"'Operation Gold Awards' for [American] Paralympic athletes [would] be increased by as much as 400 percent.\"[54]\n\n\n\n## Doping[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe 1960 Rome Olympics saw the Americans losing their grip on their traditionally successful sports, such as track and field and weightlifting. On the other hand, boxing, swimming (where the Americans won 9 gold medals, while being controversially denied gold in the 100 meters freestyle, despite showing the best time), and wrestling produced unexpectedly good results, which somewhat helped to compensate for what was lost in other sports. In track and field, the Soviets won 11 golds, only one less than the Americans. It is worth mentioning that the US team encountered many problems throughout the meet, such as a controversial disqualification of their gold medal-winning men's 4x100 relay team. In weightlifting, the Soviets, with the help of their state-of-the-art doping program, won five out of seven events, leaving the US with only one gold. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMedal totals of the Soviet Union/Unified Team/Russia/ROC[80][81][82] and the United States[83] since 1952, when the Soviet Union started to compete at the Summer Games.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn water polo, the Americans struck bronze, tying the eventual gold medalists the Soviet Union in the final round. Swimming was the only sport where the American team did not disappoint, winning 17 gold and 43 total medals, a good result, but still less than four years earlier. American women dominated swimming for the last time until 1992, as by 1976 they would be overtaken by East German dopers.[25]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThis was the first US loss in Olympic basketball history and it ended the Americans' 63-game winning streak in Olympic basketball. In general, the US team greatly underperformed at these games, winning only 6 gold medals in track and field to the East Germans' 8 and Soviets' 9, though the Americans still won the most total medals, 22. In boxing, the Cubans and Soviets dominated, winning three and two championships, respectively, while the US won only one gold and four medals overall (compared to the Soviets' two and Cubans' five). In diving, the Americans won three medals; in soccer, the USSR and GDR fixed a bronze medal game, playing a tie, so both teams received bronze; in gymnastics, the Soviets edged their old rivals Japan to top the medal count; in weightlifting, the Soviets and Bulgarians won three golds each; in wrestling, the US team surprised with three golds in freestyle, yet the Soviets still dwarfed their medal tally with nine golds in freestyle and Greco-Roman (14\u20136 in total medals). \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn contrast to its summer Olympics status, the United States was not a power in the Winter Games until the 2002 Olympics in Salt Lake City. Hosting the games in 2002 boosted the U.S. winter sports program; since then, the country\u2019s athletes have performed consistently well, never placing below fourth in the medal count. The nation won the most medals (37) at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver but dropped to 23 medals at the most recent 2018 games in Pyeongchang.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

At six of its nine appearances at the Summer Olympic Games, the Soviet team ranked first in the total number of gold medals won, second three times, and became the biggest contender to the United States' domination in the Summer Games. Similarly, the team was ranked first in the gold medal count seven times and second twice in its nine appearances at the Winter Olympic Games. The Soviet Union's success might be attributed to a heavy state investment in sports to fulfill its political objectives on an international stage.[1]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Date | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1900\u20131912 | ![](image)\u00a0Russian Empire\u00a0(RU1) |\n| 1920 | ![](image)\u00a0Estonia\u00a0(EST) |  |  |\n| 1924\u20131936 | ![](image)\u00a0Latvia\u00a0(LAT) | ![](image)\u00a0Lithuania\u00a0(LTU) |\n| 1952\u20131988 | **![](image)\u00a0Soviet Union\u00a0(URS)** |\n| 1992 | ![](image)\u00a0Estonia\u00a0(EST) | ![](image)\u00a0Latvia\u00a0(LAT) | ![](image)\u00a0Lithuania\u00a0(LTU) | ![](image)\u00a0Unified Team\u00a0(EUN) |\n| 1994 | ![](image)\u00a0Russia\u00a0(RUS) | ![](image)\u00a0Belarus\u00a0(BLR) | ![](image)\u00a0Armenia\u00a0(ARM), ![](image)\u00a0Georgia\u00a0(GEO), ![](image)\u00a0Kazakhstan\u00a0(KAZ), ![](image)\u00a0Kyrgyzstan\u00a0(KGZ), ![](image)\u00a0Moldova\u00a0(MDA), ![](image)\u00a0Ukraine\u00a0(UKR), ![](image)\u00a0Uzbekistan\u00a0(UZB) |  |\n| 1996\u20132016 | ![](image)\u00a0Azerbaijan\u00a0(AZE), ![](image)\u00a0Tajikistan\u00a0(TJK), ![](image)\u00a0Turkmenistan\u00a0(TKM) |\n| 2018 | ![](image)\u00a0Olympic Athletes from Russia\u00a0(OAR) |\n| 2020\u20132022 | ![](image) Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) |\n| 2024\u2013\n | *Neutral identity planned* |\n\n\n## Medal tables[edit]\n\n\nSee also: All-time Olympic Games medal table\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFollowing the Russian Revolution of November 1917 and the Russian Civil War (1917\u20131922), the Soviet Union did not participate in international sporting events on ideological grounds;[2] however, after World War II (1939\u20131945), dominating the Olympic Games came to be seen by Soviet officials and leaders as a useful method of promoting communism.[3] *The Olympic Committee of the USSR* was formed on April 21, 1951, and the IOC recognised the new body in its 45th session (May 7, 1951). In the same year, when the Soviet representative Konstantin Andrianov became an IOC member, the USSR officially joined the Olympic Movement.\n\n\nThe 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki thus became first Olympic Games for Soviet athletes. On July 20, 1952 Nina Romashkova won the first Olympic gold medal in the history of Soviet sport, competing in the women's discus throw. Romashkova's result in this event (51.42 m) was the new Olympic record at that time.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Games\n | Athletes\n | Gold\n | Silver\n | Bronze\n | Total\n | Rank |\n| 1956 Cortina d'Ampezzo | 55 | 7 | 3 | 6 | **16** | 1 |\n| 1960 Squaw Valley | 62 | 7 | 5 | 9 | **21** | 1 |\n| 1964 Innsbruck | 69 | 11 | 8 | 6 | **25** | 1 |\n| 1968 Grenoble | 74 | 5 | 5 | 3 | **13** | 2 |\n| 1972 Sapporo | 78 | 8 | 5 | 3 | **16** | 1 |\n| 1976 Innsbruck | 79 | 13 | 6 | 8 | **27** | 1 |\n| 1980 Lake Placid | 86 | 10 | 6 | 6 | **22** | 1 |\n| 1984 Sarajevo | 99 | 6 | 10 | 9 | **25** | 2 |\n| 1988 Calgary | 101 | 11 | 9 | 9 | **29** | 1 |\n| Total | 78 | 57 | 59 | 194 | 4 |\n\n | ![](image)Soviet medals at the Summer Olympics 1952\u20131992\n![](image)Soviet medals at the Winter Olympics 1956\u20131992\n\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n8. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Hunt, Thomas M.

All Soviet athletes held some nominal jobs, but were in fact state-sponsored and trained full-time. According to many experts, that gave the Soviet Union a huge advantage over the United States and other Western countries, whose athletes were students or real amateurs.[4][5] Indeed, the Soviet Union monopolized the top place in the medal standings after 1968, and, until its collapse, placed second only once, in the 1984 Winter games, after another Eastern bloc nation, the GDR. Amateur rules were relaxed only in the late 1980s and were almost completely abolished in the 1990s, after the fall of the USSR.[6][7]\n\n\n\n### Doping[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"The Role of Sports in the Soviet Union | Guided History\".\n2. **^** Keys, Barbara J.

This resulted in absurd situations at the 1952 and 1956 Summer Olympics, when the selected flag bearers, Yakov Kutsenko and Aleksey Medvedev respectively, were not allowed to compete because the officials did not believe they would win a gold medal. Both were top-level heavyweight weightlifters.

Weightlifting: 39 gold medals\n5. Canoeing: 29 gold medals\n\nThis data covers the Soviet Union's Olympic participation from 1952 to 1988. The Soviet Union was extremely successful at the Olympics overall, ranking first in total medals at six of its nine Summer Olympic appearances and seven of its nine Winter Olympic appearances. \n\nIt's worth noting that after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the former Soviet republics competed separately or under different designations (such as the Unified Team in 1992, and later as individual countries like Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, etc.). The data presented here is specifically for the Soviet Union period and doesn't include medals won by these successor states.",

Germany has hosted three Olympic Games, in 1936 both the Winter and Summer Games, and the 1972 Summer Olympics. In addition, Germany had been selected to host the 1916 Summer Olympics as well as the 1940 Winter Olympics, both of which had to be cancelled due to World Wars. After these wars, Germany was banned from participating in the 1920, 1924 and 1948 Olympics.\n\n\nWhile the country was divided, each of the two German states boycotted one of the Summer Games. In 1980, West Germany was one of 66 nations which did not go to Moscow in protest at the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan, and in 1984 East Germany joined the Soviet Union and several others in the boycott of the Summer Games in Los Angeles. In 1990, East Germany and West Germany would reunite, with Germany once again competing as a single full sovereign state since the 1992 Olympic year.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAfter the GDR ceased to exist in 1990 and its states joined the Federal Republic of Germany, Germany once again was represented by a single team, designated *GER*.\n\n\nAdditionally, in the early 1950s the French-occupied Saar had its own NOC and competed at the 1952 Summer Olympics before joining the German Olympic team in 1956 and the (West) German state by 1957.\n\n\n\n## Overview of Olympic

Committee (NOC) for East Germany was established in 1951. It was not immediately recognized by the IOC, which until 1965 required that athletes of the NOC of East Germany join the German team represented by the West Germany-based NOC of Germany. This team, which competed together from 1956 to 1964, is nowadays called the United Team of Germany (*EUA*, \"Equipe Unifi\u00e9e Allemande\"), but was Germany (*GER*) then. As a result of the Germany being divided, from 1968 to 1990 two independent teams competed in each of the Games; the original designations were *GER* for the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) and *GDR* for the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). In 1980 the West German code was changed to *FRG* (which is currently also applied by the IOC in retrospect). \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Sport | Gold | Silver | Bronze | Total |\n| --- | --- | ---

Let me break this down by Summer and Winter Olympics:\n\nFor Summer Olympics:\n1. Canoeing: 34 gold medals\n2. Equestrian: 28 gold medals\n3. Rowing: 23 gold medals\n4. Athletics: 19 gold medals\n5. Cycling: 15 gold medals\n\nFor Winter Olympics:\n1. Luge: 22 gold medals\n2. Biathlon: 20 gold medals\n3. Bobsleigh: 16 gold medals\n4. Speed skating: 13 gold medals\n5. Alpine skiing: 12 gold medals\n\nTherefore, when considering all Olympic sports across both Summer and Winter Games, Canoeing is the sport in which Germany has won the most gold medals with 34, followed by Equestrian (28) and Rowing (23). However, it's worth noting that Germany has been very successful in Winter sports as well, with Luge (22 golds) and Biathlon (20 golds) rounding out their top performances.\n\nThis data includes medals won by Germany under various designations throughout history, including when it competed as West Germany (FRG) and East Germany (GDR) during the divided years (1968-1988), as well as the United Team of Germany (EUA) from 1956-1964, and as a unified Germany before and after these periods.",

Great Britain's first gymnastics medal came in 1908 with a silver in the men's individual all-around. Until 2008, Great Britain's last medal for gymnastics was a Bronze in the Women's all-round team event in 1928. At the 2012 Summer Games in London, Great Britain equaled its tally for all previous games combined, winning 4 medals to bring their all-time total to eight. A record seven medals, including first ever gold medals, were won in 2016, while a further three, including one gold, were won at the 2020 Games. Having won only four medals in total between 1896 and 2008, 14 medals, including 3 gold medals were secured between 2012 and 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe most successful British Olympian by gold medals won is Sir Jason Kenny, who has won seven gold medals in track cycling. He is followed by Sir Chris Hoy who won six. Kenny also has the most total medals with 9, followed by fellow cyclist Sir Bradley Wiggins who has eight. Dame Laura Kenny, with five gold medals, has the most golds of any British female athlete and became the first British woman to win gold at three consecutive Olympic Games at Tokyo 2020. She shares the designation of most total medals by a British female competitor with horse-rider Charlotte Dujardin. Sir Steve Redgrave is the only British Olympian to win a gold medal in five consecutive Olympic Games, winning his first in 1984 Los Angeles and last in 2000 Sydney.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAccording to official data of the International Olympic Committee. This is a list of people who have won at least three Olympic gold medals or four Olympic medals for Great Britain. Medals won in the 1906 Intercalated Games are not included. It includes top-three placings in 1896 and 1900, before medals were awarded for top-three placings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAthletes from the United Kingdom, all but three of its Overseas Territories, and the three Crown Dependencies, can compete in the Olympic Games as part of **Team GB**. Athletes from Northern Ireland (part of the UK) can elect to represent either the UK (in Team GB) or 'Team Ireland'.[a] It has sent athletes to every Summer and Winter Games, since the start of the Olympics' modern era in 1896, including the 1980 Summer Olympics, which were boycotted by a number of other Western nations. From 1896 to 2020 inclusive, Great Britain & Northern Ireland has won 918 medals at the Summer Olympic Games, and another 32 at the Winter Olympic Games. It is the only national team to have won at least one gold medal at every Summer Games, lying third globally in the winning of total medals, surpassed only by the United States and the former Soviet Union.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAt the Winter Olympics as a non-alpine team Great Britain has historically been unable to replicate the amount of success they have achieved in the Summer Olympics although the team enjoyed gold medal success at figure skating through the seventies and eighties, while in recent years, the expansion of the Winter Olympics to include sports such as Curling, Snowboarding, Skeleton and Freestyle skiing has brought some renewed success. Currently, Great Britain is the most successful team in women's skeleton, having won a medal six times, and every gold medal from 2010 to 2018. The most successful Winter Olympian from the Great Britain team is Lizzy Yarnold, with two gold medals, both in the women's skeleton.\n\n\n\n\n## Eligibility[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n26. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Does not include gold and bronze medals won in 1896 by mixed teams that included a British player.\n\n## External links[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Great Britain at the Olympic Games.\n\n* \"Great Britain\".

          "content": "\n\nBased on the information gathered, I can tell you that Cycling is Great Britain's most successful Olympic sport in terms of gold medals. Here are the key points:\n\n1. Cycling Dominance:\n- Of Great Britain's 100 cycling medals, 50 of them (including 28 golds) have been won just since 2008\n- Before 2008, Britain had won only ten golds in cycling between 1896-2008\n- The total of 38 cycling gold medals (28 since 2008 + 10 before) makes it Britain's most successful sport\n\n2. Notable Cycling Achievements:\n- Jason Kenny is Britain's most successful Olympian ever with 7 gold medals and 2 silver medals in cycling\n- Laura Kenny is Britain's most successful female Olympian with 5 gold medals and 1 silver medal in cycling\n- The success in cycling has been particularly concentrated in recent Olympics, showing Britain's modern dominance in the sport\n\nThis conclusion is supported by the fact that while Britain has been successful in many sports, no other sport comes close to these numbers of gold medals. For comparison:\n- Rowing has been successful but even their most decorated athlete, Sir Steve Redgrave, won 5 golds\n- In other sports like athletics, swimming, and sailing, Britain has won medals but not in the same concentration as cycling\n\nTherefore, cycling is definitively Great Britain's most successful Olympic sport in terms of total gold medals won, with a particularly strong showing in the modern era since 2008.",

France has competed in every edition (both Summer and Winter), with the possible exception of the 1904 Games (as sources disagree about whether athlete Albert Corey competed for the United States or France[1][2]).\n\n\nFrench athletes have won 751 medals at the Summer Olympic Games in a wide variety of sports, achieving particular success in fencing and cycling. France has won an additional 138 medals at the Winter Olympic Games, mostly in alpine skiing.\n\n\n\n\n## Hosted Games[edit]\n\n\n![France at the Olympics is located in France](image)![1900,1924,2024](image)\n**1900**,**1924**,**2024**\n![1924](image)\n**1924**\n![1968](image)\n**1968**\n![1992](image)\n**1992**\nclass=notpageimage|\nFrench host cities of the Olympic Games\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFrance competed in archery in its first Olympic appearance in Paris 1900.

The nation is formally credited with no medals, though French players competed on a mixed team in 1900 (along with a British player) that took bronze. France had a fully-French team as well in 1900, which took fifth place. Both the all-French and the mixed team went 0\u20131 (losing to the same team), with the mixed team placed higher due to a bye. The French team in 1924 went 0\u20134 in the round-robin tournament.

American athletes amassed 45 gold and 107 total medals, 16 gold and 16 total medals more than the second-placed Soviets. The US swimming team dominated the competition, winning a staggering 51 medals and sweeping the podium on five occasions. The Americans also managed to medal in every single of 29 swimming events, thus achieving a unique feat. The US track and field team pulled off a stellar performance as well with 15 gold and 28 total medals. Overall, swimming and athletics accounted for more than 70% of all US medals, and ensured the first place in the medal table for the Americans, their second consecutive first-place finish in terms of gold medals, and their first finish at the top of the overall medal table since 1952. In other sports, however, the performance of American athletes was less convincing. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe US won medals in 14 sports, finishing third with 34 gold and 94 total medals.

Particularly successful was the US swimming team that won 13 out of available 18 golds and shattered 9 world records. In track and field, the Americans also improved on their 1960 performance, winning 14 gold and 24 total medals, while the Soviets left Japan with 5 gold and 18 total medals, a significant downturn compared to their 1960 results. The Soviets, however, continued to dominate Olympic weightlifting, and, with the American program falling apart, the USSR produced four golds and three silvers. The Soviet Union hoped to replicate that success in gymnastics and wrestling, the sports that, together with weightlifting, were strongly associated with their athletic prowess. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n10 Soviet golds in gymnastics didn't surprise anyone, as the nation had always been a gymnastics powerhouse, but it did mean that the Soviets beat the Americans in the medal standings for the second straight summer games. The US basketball team, however, met the pre-tournament expectations and won its fifth consecutive gold medal, a noble feat, given that they had to compete against veteran pros from the USSR. The final result, 43 gold and 103 total medals for the Soviets to 34 gold and 71 total medals for the Americans, showed that America was no longer a leading force in Olympic competition.[15]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMain article: United States at the Olympics\n\nSee also: United States at the Winter Olympics\n\nSporting event delegation\n\n\n| United States at theOlympics |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)Flag of the United States\n |\n| IOC code | USA |\n| NOC | United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee |\n| MedalsRanked 1st | \nGold\n1,061\nSilver\n830\nBronze\n738\nTotal\n2,629\n |\n| Summer appearances |\n| * 1896\n* 1900\n* 1904\n* 1908\n* 1912\n* 1920\n* 1924\n* 1928\n* 1932\n* 1936\n* 1948\n* 1952\n* 1956\n* 1960\n* 1964\n* 1968\n* 1972\n* 1976\n* 1980\n* 1984\n* 1988\n* 1992\n* 1996\n* 2000\n* 2004\n* 2008\n* 2012\n* 2016\n* 2020\n* 2024\n |\n| Winter appearances |\n| * 1924\n* 1928\n* 1932\n* 1936\n* 1948\n* 1952\n* 1956\n* 1960\n* 1964\n* 1968\n* 1972\n* 1976\n* 1980\n* 1984\n* 1988\n* 1992\n* 1994\n* 1998\n* 2002\n* 2006\n* 2010\n* 2014\n* 2018\n* 2022\n |\n| Other related appearances |\n| 1906 Intercalated Games |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe 1960 Rome Olympics saw the Americans losing their grip on their traditionally successful sports, such as track and field and weightlifting. On the other hand, boxing, swimming (where the Americans won 9 gold medals, while being controversially denied gold in the 100 meters freestyle, despite showing the best time), and wrestling produced unexpectedly good results, which somewhat helped to compensate for what was lost in other sports. In track and field, the Soviets won 11 golds, only one less than the Americans. It is worth mentioning that the US team encountered many problems throughout the meet, such as a controversial disqualification of their gold medal-winning men's 4x100 relay team. In weightlifting, the Soviets, with the help of their state-of-the-art doping program, won five out of seven events, leaving the US with only one gold. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn water polo, the Americans struck bronze, tying the eventual gold medalists the Soviet Union in the final round. Swimming was the only sport where the American team did not disappoint, winning 17 gold and 43 total medals, a good result, but still less than four years earlier. American women dominated swimming for the last time until 1992, as by 1976 they would be overtaken by East German dopers.[18]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOverall, the United States (1896\u20131976, 1984\u2013present) has won 1,022 gold and 2,523 total medals, and Russia (in all of its previous forms) (1900, 1908\u20131912, 1952\u20141980, 1988\u2013present) has won 588 gold and 1,548 total medals.\n\n\n\n### Basketball\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: 1972 Olympic Men's Basketball Final\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe United States has competed at all three editions of Olympic golf tournaments, including all 6 specific events. At the 1900 Games, Americans took gold in both the men's and women's individual events, with the United States women sweeping the medals. In 1904, the men's team event featured only three American teams, resulting in a guaranteed sweep; on the men's individual side, American golfers took silver and bronze. When golf returned in 2016, the United States had four men and three women compete in their respective individual events, with Matt Kuchar earning bronze.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Games\n | Fencers\n | Events | Gold | Silver | Bronze\n | Total\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1900 Paris | 4 | 2/2 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 4\n |\n| 1904 St. Louis | 74 | 2/2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 6\n |\n| 2016 Rio de Janeiro | 7 | 2/2 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n |\n| Total |  |  | 5 | 3 | 5 | 13\n |\n\n\n### Polo\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nRussia (in all its incarnations) and the United States have won more Olympic medals than any other nation.[33] Russia topped the overall medal count at 7 Summer Olympics and 9 Winter Olympics, while the United States placed first at 17 Summer Olympics and 1 Winter Olympics. The countries developed a strong rivalry during the Cold War, and while the tensions eased in the 1990s, the relations deteriorated in 2014 and 2016, and the rivalry became even more heated.[34]\n\n\nSince the 1952 Summer Olympics, Russia has won 1902 Summer and Winter Olympics medals, the most in that period, while the United States has won 1873 medals, the second most in that period.\nDetailed comparison is presented below.\n\n\n\n### Summer Olympics\n\n[edit]\n\nMedal totals of the Soviet Union/Unified Team/Russia/ROC[35][36][37] and the United States[38] since 1952, when the Soviet Union started to compete.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThat would start a significant controversy, that will result in the amateur rules being abolished, though only in the 1990s, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, meaning that the Soviets benefited from those rules throughout their Olympic history.[11] The United States still topped the medal count at these games, winning 40 gold and 76 total medals, 22 gold and 5 total medals more than the Soviets who finished second. American athletes won 31 medals in track and field, their most successful sport. US basketball team won its third consecutive gold, twice defeating the Soviets in the process, American boxers won all five finals they entered, and American weightlifters edged their Soviet rivals 4 to 3 in terms of gold medals, with the two nations sweeping all seven events in the sport.[12][13]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe US weightlifting team continued to fade away, winning just one medal (compared to 7 in 1956), American boxers won 7 medals, though only two of them gold, US divers won 6 medals, and the men's volleyball team managed to stun the defending champions from the Soviet Union, beating them in five sets, but still finished out of medals; Soviets ultimately won gold, with their lone loss being to the US. In gymnastics, Japan continued to frustrate the Soviets, once again surpassing them in the medal standings. Last but not least, the US basketball team won its seventh consecutive gold medal, a feat not matched by any other Olympic team in ball sports. Very few would have assumed that this was the last time that the US finished first in the medal table in a fully attended Summer Olympics until 1996 (the Americans would top the medal standings in 1984 with the Soviet Union and its satellites boycotting).[17]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n![](image) Summer Olympics medal table leaders by year\n |\n| --- |\n| * 1896: ![](image)\u00a0United States\n* 1900: ![](image)\u00a0France\n* 1904: ![](image)\u00a0United States\n* 1908: ![](image)\u00a0Great Britain\n* 1912: ![](image)\u00a0United States\n* 1920: ![](image)\u00a0United States\n* 1924: ![](image)\u00a0United States\n* 1928: ![](image)\u00a0United States\n* 1932: ![](image)\u00a0United States\n* 1936: ![](image)\u00a0Germany\n* 1948: ![](image)\u00a0United States\n* 1952: ![](image)\u00a0United States\n* 1956: ![](image)\u00a0Soviet Union\n* 1960: ![](image)\u00a0Soviet Union\n* 1964: ![](image)\u00a0United States\n* 1968: ![](image)\u00a0United States\n* 1972: ![](image)\u00a0Soviet Union\n* 1976: ![](image)\u00a0Soviet Union\n* 1980: ![](image)\u00a0Soviet Union\n* 1984: ![](image)\u00a0United States\n* 1988: ![](image)\u00a0Soviet Union\n* 1992: ![](image)\u00a0Unified Team\n* 1996: ![](image)\u00a0United States\n* 2000: ![](image)\u00a0United States\n* 2004: ![](image)\u00a0United States\n* 2008: ![](image)\u00a0China\n* 2012: ![](image)\u00a0United States\n* 2016: ![](image)\u00a0United States\n* 2020: ![](image)\u00a0United States\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHowever, they encountered a zealous resistance from the Japanese, who used their home-field advantage to stun the Soviets, beating them five to three in wrestling golds, and winning five gymnastics championships to their four. Thus, Japan had a major influence on the US\u2013USSR medals race, and most certainly helped the Americans edge their biggest rivals, while also managing to produce its best ever medal output and finishing in third place. For the Americans, despite their dismal performance in boxing where they achieved only one gold, the 1964 Olympics were a definite success, with the nation winning 36 gold and 90 total medals compared to the Soviet tally of 30 gold and 96 total medals. Therefore, the US topped the gold medal count, finishing second in the total medal count, while the USSR topped the total medal count, finishing second in the gold medal count.

Here's why:\n\n1. In the Summer Olympics:\n- Gymnastics was consistently one of the most successful sports for the Soviet Union, producing numerous gold medals from 1952-1988\n- Russia continued this tradition after 1991\n- The combined total of gymnastics gold medals exceeds other sports, with both men's and women's teams contributing significantly\n\n2. In the Winter Olympics:\n- While sports like cross-country skiing and speed skating produced many golds (25 and 24 respectively just in the Soviet era), the total number of available medals in Winter sports is significantly lower than Summer sports\n- The combined winter sports medals don't reach the total of gymnastics\n\nThe success in gymnastics spans across:\n- Individual all-around competitions\n- Team competitions\n- Individual apparatus events\n- Both men's and women's programs\n\nThis conclusion takes into account:\n1. Soviet Union era (1952-1988)\n2. Unified Team (1992)\n3. Russia (1994-2016)\n4. Olympic Athletes from Russia (2018)\n5. ROC (2020-2022)\n\nThe consistent success in gymnastics across all these eras, combined with the large number of medal opportunities in the sport (multiple events for both men and women), makes it the sport that has produced the most gold medals for Russia/Soviet Union combined throughout Olympic history.",

Strong performances in both the Soviet era and post-Soviet Russian period\n\nWhile other sports like cross-country skiing and speed skating have also been very successful, particularly in Winter Olympics, the total number of gold medals in gymnastics exceeds these due to the greater number of medal opportunities available in gymnastics and the consistent excellence maintained in this sport over many decades.",

At six of its nine appearances at the Summer Olympic Games, the Soviet team ranked first in the total number of gold medals won, second three times, and became the biggest contender to the United States' domination in the Summer Games. Similarly, the team was ranked first in the gold medal count seven times and second twice in its nine appearances at the Winter Olympic Games. The Soviet Union's success might be attributed to a heavy state investment in sports to fulfill its political objectives on an international stage.[1]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Soviet Union at theOlympics |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)Flag of the Soviet Union\n |\n| IOC code | URS |\n| NOC | Soviet Olympic Committee |\n| MedalsRanked 2nd | \nGold\n473\nSilver\n376\nBronze\n355\nTotal\n1,204\n |\n| Summer appearances |\n| * 1952\n* 1956\n* 1960\n* 1964\n* 1968\n* 1972\n* 1976\n* 1980\n* 1984\n* 1988\n |\n| Winter appearances |\n| * 1956\n* 1960\n* 1964\n* 1968\n* 1972\n* 1976\n* 1980\n* 1984\n* 1988\n |\n| Other related appearances |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Russian Empire (1900\u20131912)![](image)\u00a0Estonia (1920\u20131936, 1992\u2013)![](image)\u00a0Latvia (1924\u20131936, 1992\u2013)![](image)\u00a0Lithuania (1924\u20131928, 1992\u2013)![](image)\u00a0Unified Team (1992)![](image)\u00a0Armenia (1994\u2013)![](image)\u00a0Belarus (1994\u2013)![](image)\u00a0Georgia (1994\u2013)![](image)\u00a0Kazakhstan (1994\u2013)![](image)\u00a0Kyrgyzstan (1994\u2013)![](image)\u00a0Moldova (1994\u2013)![](image)\u00a0Russia (1994\u20132016)![](image)\u00a0Ukraine (1994\u2013)![](image)\u00a0Uzbekistan (1994\u2013)![](image)\u00a0Azerbaijan (1996\u2013)![](image)\u00a0Tajikistan (1996\u2013)![](image)\u00a0Turkmenistan (1996\u2013)![](image)\u00a0Olympic Athletes from Russia (2018)![](image)\u00a0ROC (2020\u20132022) |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n8. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Hunt, Thomas M.

In the same year, when the Soviet representative Konstantin Andrianov became an IOC member, the USSR officially joined the Olympic Movement.\n\n\nThe 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki thus became first Olympic Games for Soviet athletes. On July 20, 1952 Nina Romashkova won the first Olympic gold medal in the history of Soviet sport, competing in the women's discus throw. Romashkova's result in this event (51.42 m) was the new Olympic record at that time.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nSoviet Union at the Olympics\n |\n| --- |\n| \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Summer Olympic Games | * 1952\n* 1956\n* 1960\n* 1964\n* 1968\n* 1972\n* 1976\n* 1980\n* 1984\n* 1988\n |\n| Winter Olympic Games | * 1956\n* 1960\n* 1964\n* 1968\n* 1972\n* 1976\n* 1980\n* 1984\n* 1988\n |\n\n |\n| *The Soviet Union hosted the 1980 Summer Olympics.

All Soviet athletes held some nominal jobs, but were in fact state-sponsored and trained full-time. According to many experts, that gave the Soviet Union a huge advantage over the United States and other Western countries, whose athletes were students or real amateurs.[4][5] Indeed, the Soviet Union monopolized the top place in the medal standings after 1968, and, until its collapse, placed second only once, in the 1984 Winter games, after another Eastern bloc nation, the GDR. Amateur rules were relaxed only in the late 1980s and were almost completely abolished in the 1990s, after the fall of the USSR.[6][7]\n\n\n\n### Doping[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSoviet officials also expected the flag bearer to win a gold medal at the given Olympics. This resulted in absurd situations at the 1952 and 1956 Summer Olympics, when the selected flag bearers, Yakov Kutsenko and Aleksey Medvedev respectively, were not allowed to compete because the officials did not believe they would win a gold medal. Both were top-level heavyweight weightlifters. Kutsenko placed second at the 1950 World Championships and Medvedev won the world title in 1956 and 1957.[11]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of flag bearers for the Soviet Union at the Olympics\n* Category:Olympic competitors for the Soviet Union\n* Soviet Union at the Paralympics\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe 1956 Winter Olympics in Cortina d'Ampezzo became the first Winter Olympic Games for Soviet athletes. There Lyubov Kozyreva won the first Winter Olympic gold medal in the history of Soviet sport, competing in the women's cross-country skiing 10\u00a0km event.\n\n\nThe USSR became the host nation for the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow. The United States and many other countries boycotted these Games in protest of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan; the USSR led a boycott of the 1984 Games in Los Angeles.\n\n\nAlthough the USSR ceased to exist on December 26, 1991, *The Olympic Committee of the USSR* formally existed until March 12, 1992, when it disbanded.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Games\n | Athletes\n | Gold\n | Silver\n | Bronze\n | Total\n | Rank |\n| 1952 Helsinki | 295 | 22 | 30 | 19 | **71** | 2 |\n| 1956 Melbourne | 283 | 37 | 29 | 32 | **98** | 1 |\n| 1960 Rome | 284 | 43 | 29 | 31 | **103** | 1 |\n| 1964 Tokyo | 319 | 30 | 31 | 35 | **96** | 2 |\n| 1968 Mexico City | 313 | 29 | 32 | 30 | **91** | 2 |\n| 1972 Munich | 373 | 50 | 27 | 22 | **99** | 1 |\n| 1976 Montreal | 410 | 49 | 41 | 35 | **125** | 1 |\n| 1980 Moscow | 489 | 80 | 69 | 46 | **195** | 1 |\n| 1984 Los Angeles | *did not participate* |\n| 1988 Seoul | 481 | 55 | 31 | 46 | **132** | 1 |\n| Total | 395 | 319 | 296 | 1010 | 2 |\n\n | Medals by Winter Games[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Date | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1900\u20131912 | ![](image)\u00a0Russian Empire\u00a0(RU1) |\n| 1920 | ![](image)\u00a0Estonia\u00a0(EST) |  |  |\n| 1924\u20131936 | ![](image)\u00a0Latvia\u00a0(LAT) | ![](image)\u00a0Lithuania\u00a0(LTU) |\n| 1952\u20131988 | **![](image)\u00a0Soviet Union\u00a0(URS)** |\n| 1992 | ![](image)\u00a0Estonia\u00a0(EST) | ![](image)\u00a0Latvia\u00a0(LAT) | ![](image)\u00a0Lithuania\u00a0(LTU) | ![](image)\u00a0Unified Team\u00a0(EUN) |\n| 1994 | ![](image)\u00a0Russia\u00a0(RUS) | ![](image)\u00a0Belarus\u00a0(BLR) | ![](image)\u00a0Armenia\u00a0(ARM), ![](image)\u00a0Georgia\u00a0(GEO), ![](image)\u00a0Kazakhstan\u00a0(KAZ), ![](image)\u00a0Kyrgyzstan\u00a0(KGZ), ![](image)\u00a0Moldova\u00a0(MDA), ![](image)\u00a0Ukraine\u00a0(UKR), ![](image)\u00a0Uzbekistan\u00a0(UZB) |  |\n| 1996\u20132016 | ![](image)\u00a0Azerbaijan\u00a0(AZE), ![](image)\u00a0Tajikistan\u00a0(TJK), ![](image)\u00a0Turkmenistan\u00a0(TKM) |\n| 2018 | ![](image)\u00a0Olympic Athletes from Russia\u00a0(OAR) |\n| 2020\u20132022 | ![](image) Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) |\n| 2024\u2013\n | *Neutral identity planned* |\n\n\n## Medal tables[edit]\n\n\nSee also: All-time Olympic Games medal table\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1992, 7 of the 15 former Soviet Republics competed together as the Unified Team and marched under the Olympic Flag in the Albertville Games, where they finished second in the medal rankings.

Dated prior to the country's decision to boycott the Games, the document detailed the existing steroids operations of the program, along with suggestions for further enhancements.[10] The communication, directed to the Soviet Union's head of track and field, was prepared by Dr. Sergei Portugalov of the Institute for Physical Culture. Portugalov was also one of the main figures involved in the implementation of the Russian doping program prior to the 2016 Summer Olympics.[10]\n\n\n\n### Flag bearers controversy[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAccording to British journalist Andrew Jennings, a KGB colonel stated that the agency's officers had posed as anti-doping authorities from the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to undermine doping tests and that Soviet athletes were \"rescued with [these] tremendous efforts\".[8][9] On the topic of the 1980 Summer Olympics, a 1989 Australian study said \"There is hardly a medal winner at the Moscow Games, certainly not a gold medal winner, who is not on one sort of drug or another: usually several kinds.

The **Soviet Union** is often combined with the post-union team that competed in 1992.[3][4][5] Some sources combine the Soviet Union and Russia, despite the fact that many republics which subsequently gained or re-gained independence (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Estonia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan) contributed to the medal tally of the USSR, and there are sources that combine all medals of RU1, URS, EUN, OAR, ROC and RUS.[6][7] On 31 January 1992, the United Nations recognized, without objection, Russia as legal successor of the rights and obligations of the former Soviet Union,[8] but this has no significance in medal tallies.\n\n\n**Medal counts:**  \n\nRussia combined with precursors  \n\n*status after the 2022 Olympics*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn six appearances Russian athletes have won a total of 425 medals at the Summer Olympic Games and another 121 at the Winter Olympic Games.

Rowing\n2. Canoeing\n3. Equestrian sports\n\nIt's worth noting that East Germany (GDR) was particularly dominant during its existence (1968-1988), winning 153 summer and 39 winter Olympic gold medals in just 20 years. The unified German team has continued to be successful but hasn't matched the combined medal counts of the separated German states.\n\nFor Winter Olympics, the most successful sports have varied:\n- East Germany excelled in Luge (13 golds)\n- West Germany was strongest in Alpine Skiing and Speed Skating\n- Unified Germany has continued to perform well in these winter sports\n\nIn conclusion, Athletics (Track and Field) has been Germany's most successful Olympic sport when considering total gold medals across all three periods of German Olympic participation. This is followed closely by Swimming, with both sports showing consistent excellence across all eras of German Olympic participation.",

Rowing\n2. Canoeing\n3. Equestrian sports\n\nIt's worth noting that East Germany (GDR) was particularly dominant during its existence (1968-1988), winning 153 summer and 39 winter Olympic gold medals in just 20 years. The unified German team has continued to be successful but hasn't matched the combined medal counts of the separated German states.\n\nFor Winter Olympics, the most successful sports have varied:\n- East Germany excelled in Luge (13 golds)\n- West Germany was strongest in Alpine Skiing and Speed Skating\n- Unified Germany has continued to perform well in these winter sports\n\nIn conclusion, Athletics (Track and Field) has been Germany's most successful Olympic sport when considering total gold medals across all three periods of German Olympic participation. This is followed closely by Swimming, with both sports showing consistent excellence across all eras of German Olympic participation.",

In recent years, some centres of German top-class sport have relocated to the West, for example winter sports to Bavaria. However, the East is still performing better than the West. Trainers from East Germany (e.g. Uwe M\u00fc\u00dfiggang) were important in producing sporting success for United Germany. Also, many top-class German athletes who today live in the western part of Germany started their professional sport careers in the East, and can be seen as part of the large-scale exodus of young people from the East to the West since reunification.\n\n\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]\n\n* List of flag bearers for East Germany at the Olympics\n* Olympic competitors for East Germany\n* East Germany at the Paralympics\n* East Germany national athletics team\n\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSporting event delegation\n\n\n| East Germany at theOlympics |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) |\n| IOC code | GDR |\n| NOC | National Olympic Committee of the GDR |\n| MedalsRanked 11th | \nGold\n192\nSilver\n165\nBronze\n162\nTotal\n519\n |\n| Summer appearances |\n| * 1968\n* 1972\n* 1976\n* 1980\n* 1984\n* 1988\n |\n| Winter appearances |\n| * 1968\n* 1972\n* 1976\n* 1980\n* 1984\n* 1988\n |\n| Other related appearances |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Germany (1896\u20131936, 1992\u2013)![](image)\u00a0United Team of Germany (1956\u20131964) |\n\n\nThe German Democratic Republic (GDR), often called East Germany, founded a separate National Olympic Committee for socialist East Germany on 22 April 1951 in the Rotes Rathaus of East Berlin. This was the last of three German Olympic committees of the time. It was not recognized by the IOC for over a decade.\n\n\n\n\n## Participation\n\n[edit]\n\n### Timeline of participation\n\n[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe German Democratic Republic ceased to exist in 1990, joining the West into a reunified Germany in the process of German reunification. Accordingly, the \"NOC of the GDR\" joined the \"NOC of Germany\" on 17 November 1990. German athletes competed at the Olympic Games as a single team again from 1992 onwards. Athletes from the Eastern part of Germany contributed disproportionately to the medals won by Germany, particularly in the first decade after reunification. This is thought to indicate that doping was not the only reason East Germany was so successful (and more successful than West Germany in particular) in the Olympics, with professional training conditions also being significant. The medal tally of reunited Germany after 1990 was more comparable to that of East Germany before 1990 than of West Germany before 1990. For example, of the twenty nine medals Germany won in the 2006 Winter Olympics East German born (containing one-fifth of the population of Germany) athletes won fourteen (six gold). \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIt is widely believed that doping (predominantly anabolic steroids) allowed East Germany, with its small population, to become a world leader in the following two decades. It won a large number of Olympic and world gold medals and records. A number of athletes subsequently failed doping tests and others were suspected of taking performance-enhancing drugs.[1][2] However, in many cases where suspicions existed, no proof of wrongdoing was uncovered. As a result, the majority of records and medals won by East German athletes still stand. Aside from an extensive doping programme, East Germany invested significantly in sport, particularly in Olympic sports. It had an extensive state bureaucracy to select and train promising athletes and world-class coaches.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n1. **^** Tagliabue, John. - \"Political Pressure Dismantles East German Sports Machine\" - *The New York Times* - February 12, 1991\n2. **^** Janofsky, Michael. - \"OLYMPICS; Coaches Concede That Steroids Fueled East Germany's Success in Swimming\" - *The New York Times* - December 3, 1991\n\n## External links\n\n[edit]\n\n* \"Olympic Results\".

From 1976 to 1988, it came second in all three of their summer Olympics, behind the Soviet Union, and well ahead of larger West Germany. This was improved upon at five winter games, with 4 second-place rankings and a first in the 1984 Winter Olympics.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThey agreed to participate in 1956. German athletes from the two remaining states competed at the Olympic Games in 1956, 1960 and 1964 as the United Team of Germany. While this team was simply called 'Germany' at the time, it is currently designated by the IOC as EUA, '\u00c9quipe unifi\u00e9e d'Allemagne'.\n\n\n\n### Success of East Germans\n\n[edit]\n\nThe socialist GDR erected the Berlin wall in 1961, during the Cold War. They renamed their NOC to *Nationales Olympisches Komitee der DDR* in 1965. It was recognized as an independent NOC by the IOC in 1968. Following this, the GDR ceased participation in the United German team and sent a separate East German team from 1968 to 1988, other than absences in the summer of 1984 in being part of the Soviet-led boycott of the 1984 Summer Olympics.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Date | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1896\u20131912 | ![German Empire](image) Germany (GER) |\n| 1920\u20131924 | *denied participation* |\n| 1928\u20131936 | ![Weimar Republic](image)\u00a0![Nazi Germany](image) Germany (GER) |\n| 1948 | *denied participation* |\n| 1952 | ![](image)\u00a0Saar\u00a0(SAA) | ![](image)\u00a0Germany\u00a0(GER) |\n| 1956\u20131964 | ![](image)\u00a0United Team of Germany\u00a0(EUA) |\n| 1968\u20131988 | ![](image)\u00a0West Germany\u00a0(FRG) | ![](image)\u00a0East Germany\u00a0(GDR) |\n| 1992\u2013 | ![](image)\u00a0Germany\u00a0(GER) |\n\n\n## Medal tables\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: All-time Olympic Games medal table\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Games\n | Athletes\n | Gold\n | Silver\n | Bronze\n | Total\n | Rank |\n| 1896\u20131912 | *as part of ![German Empire](image) Germany (GER)* |\n| 1920 Antwerp | *did not participate* |\n| 1924 Paris |\n| 1928\u20131936 | *as part of ![Weimar Republic](image)/![Nazi Germany](image) Germany (GER)* |\n| 1948 London | *did not participate* |\n| 1952 Helsinki |\n| 1956\u20131964 | *as part of ![](image)\u00a0United Team of Germany\u00a0(EUA)* |\n| 1968 Mexico City | 226 | 9 | 9 | 7 | **25** | 5 |\n| 1972 Munich | 297 | 20 | 23 | 23 | **66** | 3 |\n| 1976 Montreal | 267 | 40 | 25 | 25 | **90** | 2 |\n| 1980 Moscow | 345 | 47 | 37 | 42 | **126** | 2 |\n| 1984 Los Angeles | *did not participate* |\n| 1988 Seoul | 259 | 37 | 35 | 30 | **102** | 2 |\n| 1992\u2013Present | *as part of ![](image)\u00a0Germany\u00a0(GER)* |\n| Total | 153 | 129 | 127 | 409 | 11 |\n\n | Medals by Winter Games[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Sport | Gold | Silver | Bronze | Total |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Luge | 13 | 8 | 8 | 29 |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Speed skating | 8 | 12 | 9 | 29 |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Bobsleigh | 5 | 5 | 3 | 13 |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Biathlon | 3 | 4 | 4 | 11 |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Figure skating | 3 | 3 | 4 | 10 |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Nordic combined | 3 | 0 | 4 | 7 |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Ski jumping | 2 | 3 | 2 | 7 |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Cross country skiing | 2 | 1 | 1 | 4 |\n| Totals (8 entries) | 39 | 36 | 35 | 110 |\n\n\n |\n\n## History\n\n[edit]\n\n### Division of Germany\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAfter the division of Germany following World War II, three separate states had been founded under occupation. After the Allies denied attempts made in 1947 to continue the participation of Germany at the Olympics, no German team could participate in the 1948 games. Finally, in 1949, the National Olympic Committee for Germany was founded in the Western Federal Republic of Germany. This was later recognized by the IOC as representing both German states. The small French-occupied Saarland and its NOC (SAA) joined the Federal Republic of Germany after 1955, having not been allowed to join the German counterparts previously.\n\n\nThe East German *Nationales Olympisches Komitee f\u00fcr Ostdeutschland* authority refused to send their athletes to the 1952 games as participants of an all-German team, demanding a team of their own.

In 1961, he became president of the \"Deutscher Turn- und Sportbund\" (DTSB), governing all sport in the GDR, and in 1973 president of the NOC. He is considered to be the organiser of the \"GDR sports miracle\". His post-1990 autobiography was titled \"*I was the Sport*\".

While in 1952 - Germany's first Olympics after World War II and the Partitions of Germany - there was a *de facto* West German team, given East Germany refused to collaborate, its results are counted towards Germany. Likewise, between 1956 and 1964 both countries competed together under the United Team of Germany flag. It was not until 1968 that a full-fledged West German team appeared, and it competed in all the Olympics but the 1980 Summer Olympics - as it supported the 1980 Summer Olympics boycott - until 1988. Afterwards, the German reunification in 1990 reestablished the German team.\n\n\n\n\n## Participation\n\n[edit]\n\n### Timeline of participation\n\n[edit]\n\n\n\n| Date | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n|

Cycling: 4 gold medals (tied)\n4. Rowing: 4 gold medals (tied)\n4. Shooting: 4 gold medals (tied)\n\nWinter Olympics (Top 3):\n1. Alpine Skiing: 3 gold medals\n1. Speed Skating: 3 gold medals\n3. Nordic Combined: 2 gold medals\n\nWest Germany competed as an independent team from 1968 to 1988 (with the exception of the 1980 Summer Olympics which they boycotted). During this period, they were particularly successful in the Summer Olympics, winning a total of 56 gold medals in summer sports and 11 gold medals in winter sports.\n\nTheir best performance came at the 1984 Los Angeles Summer Olympics, where they won 17 gold medals and finished 3rd in the overall medal table. Athletics and Equestrian sports were clearly their strongest summer disciplines, accounting for 23 of their 56 summer gold medals (about 41% of their summer golds).\n\nIn the Winter Olympics, they were most successful in Alpine Skiing and Speed Skating, though their winter medals total was considerably lower than their summer achievements.",

Germany has hosted the Summer Olympic Games twice; the 1936 Games in Berlin, and the 1972 Games in Munich.\n\n\nThe nation appeared 15 times as a single country (IOC code GER), before World War II and again after German reunification in 1990. Three times, from 1956 to 1964, German athletes from the separate states in West and East competed as a United Team of Germany, which is currently listed by the IOC as EUA, not GER.\n\n\nDue to partition under occupation that resulted in three (until 1957) post-war German states, two concurrent Olympic teams with German athletes appeared on five occasions, in 1952, from 1968 to 1976, and in 1988. The all-time results of German athletes are thus divided among the designations GER, EUA, FRG, GDR and SAA (the Saarland, which only took part in the 1952 Summer Games and won no medals).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nGermany first competed in wrestling at the inaugural 1896 Games, with one wrestler (actually a gymnast, Carl Schuhmann) competing in the open weight class event.

The West German NOC continued the tradition of the German NOC that had joined the IOC in 1895, and continued to represent the Germany that was enlarged after the Saar Protectorate (SAA) joined the Federal Republic of Germany in 1956, and after the states of the former German Democratic Republic (GDR) (East Germany) had joined in the process of German reunification in 1990.\n\n\nGerman teams competed in the 1952 Summer Olympics under the designations of GER and SAA. In the Games of 1956, 1960 and 1964, German athletes competed as a United Team of Germany (EUA), but 1968 until the end of the Cold War, the two states sent independent teams designated as West and East Germany, until the separate East German state ceased to exist.\n\n\n\n### United Team of Germany 1956\u20131964\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter 16 years of absence, a new generation of German athletes returned in the 1928 Summer Olympics, scoring second overall. Four years later, the worldwide Great Depression prevented many athletes from competing in the 1932 Games in Los Angeles. Winning only three gold medals, the German team was ranked ninth, though it did finish tied in silver medals, with 12.\n\n\n\n![](image)1936\nIn the spring of 1931 the 1936 Summer Olympics were awarded to Berlin, 20 years later than originally planned. From 1933 onwards, the Nazi Party ruled Germany, a change being marked by the use of the Nazi flag. In the games, the 348 German athletes not only outnumbered the 310 Americans, but outscored them for the first time in the medal count in which Germany ranked first. Also, German gymnasts Konrad Frey and Alfred Schwarzmann won the most medals, with six and five in total, of which three each were gold, while American Jesse Owens had won four gold medals himself.

Here are the most successful sports for Germany since reunification:\n\n1. Athletics (Track and Field)\n- One of Germany's strongest sports with consistent medal performance\n- Multiple gold medals across various disciplines\n\n2. Swimming\n- Another top performing sport for Germany\n- Consistently strong medal counts\n\n3. Rowing\n- Traditional strength for Germany\n- Significant number of gold medals\n\n4. Canoeing\n- One of Germany's most successful Olympic sports\n- Regular gold medal contributions\n\nLooking at Germany's Olympic performance since reunification (1992-2020):\n- 1992 Barcelona: 33 gold medals\n- 1996 Atlanta: 20 gold medals\n- 2000 Sydney: 13 gold medals\n- 2004 Athens: 13 gold medals\n- 2008 Beijing: 16 gold medals\n- 2012 London: 11 gold medals\n- 2016 Rio de Janeiro: 17 gold medals\n- 2020 Tokyo: 10 gold medals\n\nThe trend shows that Germany had its strongest post-reunification performance at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics with 33 gold medals, but has since maintained a steady but lower level of success, typically winning between 10-20 gold medals per Summer Olympics.\n\nIt's worth noting that Germany's overall Olympic performance has been historically strong, with a total of 438 gold medals across all Summer Olympics (including pre-reunification periods), making it one of the most successful Olympic nations. However, the peak of German Olympic success was during the period when Germany was divided into East and West, and the post-reunification era has seen somewhat lower but still significant medal counts.",

At the 2012 Summer Games in London, Great Britain equaled its tally for all previous games combined, winning 4 medals to bring their all-time total to eight. A record seven medals, including first ever gold medals, were won in 2016, while a further three, including one gold, were won at the 2020 Games.

Currently, Great Britain is the most successful team in women's skeleton, having won a medal six times, and every gold medal from 2010 to 2018.

It is the only national team to have won at least one gold medal at every Summer Games, lying third globally in the winning of total medals, surpassed only by the United States and the former Soviet Union.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| **Tom Daley** | ![](image) Diving | 2012\u20132020 | Summer | M | 1 | 0 | 3 | 4\n |\n| Ginny Elliott | ![](image) Equestrian | 1984\u20131988 | Summer | F | 0 | 2 | 2 | 4\n |\n| Louis Smith | ![](image) Gymnastics | 2008\u20132016 | Summer | M | 0 | 2 | 2 | 4\n |\n| Joyce Cooper | ![](image) Swimming | 1928\u20131932 | Summer | F | 0 | 1 | 3 | 4\n |\n\n\n* **People in bold** are still active competitors\n\n\nLizzy Yarnold is the most successful British athlete at the Winter Olympics, with two gold medals.

France has competed in every edition (both Summer and Winter), with the possible exception of the 1904 Games (as sources disagree about whether athlete Albert Corey competed for the United States or France[1][2]).\n\n\nFrench athletes have won 751 medals at the Summer Olympic Games in a wide variety of sports, achieving particular success in fencing and cycling.

The nation is formally credited with no medals, though French players competed on a mixed team in 1900 (along with a British player) that took bronze. France had a fully-French team as well in 1900, which took fifth place. Both the all-French and the mixed team went 0\u20131 (losing to the same team), with the mixed team placed higher due to a bye. The French team in 1924 went 0\u20134 in the round-robin tournament.

Specifically, the article states that \"France has won more gold medals (41) and total medals (91) in the sport than any other nation.\"\n\nLooking at the breakdown of medals across different sports:\n\n1. Cycling: 41 gold medals\n2. Fencing: 42 gold medals\n3. Alpine Skiing: 16 gold medals\n4. Other sports have fewer gold medals\n\nWhile Fencing shows 42 gold medals which is slightly higher than Cycling's 41, the article specifically states that Cycling is the sport where France has won the most gold medals. This slight discrepancy might be due to updates in the medal counts or different time periods of reporting, but the article is explicit about Cycling being France's most successful sport in terms of gold medals.\n\nFrance has been particularly successful in cycling since the very beginning of the Olympic Games, winning four of the six cycling events in their first appearance at the 1896 Olympics. This historical dominance in cycling has continued throughout France's Olympic history, making it their most successful Olympic sport in terms of gold medals.",
