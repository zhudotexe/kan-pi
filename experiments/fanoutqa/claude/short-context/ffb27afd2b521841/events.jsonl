Byzantine emperors Constantine VIII and Basil II, reigning for 66 years in total (962–1028) and for 65 years in total (960–1025) respectively, are not included, because for part of those periods they reigned only nominally as junior co-emperors alongside senior emperors.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThese monarchs are grouped according to length of reign by year in whole numbers. Within each year-grouping, they appear in historical order. In a given year, there may have been a wide array of actual reign lengths based on days. Thus, this table does not present a precise ranking by length of reign. The list is limited to those that might reasonably be expected to lie within the range of those in the tables above, at minimum 56 years. The list is sorted alphabetically. ***Emphasised*** states were sovereign. Japanese legendary emperors, according to the ancient Japanese calendar, reigned for very long terms of 60–70 years each. The longest ruler of the legendary emperors, Emperor Kōan, was claimed to have reigned for about 101 years. These figures are not included in the table because they are regarded as inaccurate by modern scholars. For those, see Longevity myths.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n## Monarchs of dependent or constituent states with verifiable reigns by exact date[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

When he was only four months old, his father died suddenly while dancing incwala. Sobhuza was chosen king soon after that and his grandmother Labotsibeni and his uncle Prince Malunge led the Swazi nation until his maturity in 1921.[3] Sobhuza was acknowledged as King by the British in 1967, and Swaziland achieved independence in 1968. Sobhuza continued to reign until his death in 1982. He was succeeded by Mswati III, his young son with Inkhosikati Ntfombi Tfwala, who was crowned in 1986.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nIngwenyama Sobhuza was born in Zombodze on 22 July 1899.[4] He ascended to the throne after the death of his father, Ngwane V, as King of Swaziland on 10 December 1899, when he was only four months old.[5] He was educated at the Swazi National School, Zombodze, and at the Lovedale Institution in the Eastern Cape, South Africa, before assuming the Swazi throne as King at the age of twenty-two.[4] His grandmother, Labotsibeni Mdluli, served as regent throughout his youth, formally transferring power to the *Ngwenyama* on 22 December 1921.[5] Before assuming his royal duties, he studied anthropology in England.[6]\n\n\n\n## Kingship[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nThe National Archives pictures of the Swazi royal family\n\nSobhuza's direct reign would endure more than 60 years (1921–1982), during which he presided over Swaziland's independence from the United Kingdom in 1968, after which the British government recognised him as *King of Swaziland* (Eswatini).[5] Early in his reign, Sobhuza sought to address the problem of land partition and deprivation instituted by the British authorities in 1907. He did so by first leading a delegation to London to meet with King George V and petition him to restore the lands to the Swazi people.[7] He again took his case on the land issue in 1929 to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. He was defeated by the terms of the Foreign Jurisdictions Act 1890, which effectively placed the actions of British administrations in protectorates beyond the reach of the British courts.[4] Sobhuza's role during this colonial period was for the most part ceremonial, but he still had major influence as a traditional head of the Swazi nation.[4] In 1934, he received the anthropologist Bronislaw Malinowski. In 1953, he attended the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in London.[8]\n\n\nIn the early 1960s Sobhuza played a major role in events that led to independence for his country in 1968. He opposed the post-colonial Westminster constitution proposed by the British government, in which he was assigned the role of constitutional monarch.[4] As a consequence, acting through his advisory council, he formed the *Imbokodvo National Movement*, a political party, which contested and won all seats in the 1967 pre-independence elections.[4] He became recognized by the British as King of Swaziland in 1967 when Swaziland was given direct rule. Independence was achieved on 6 September 1968. Following this, Sobhuza skilfully blended appeal to tribal custom with a capacity to manage economic and social change for his kingdom.[4] On 12 April 1973, the king repealed the constitution and dissolved parliament, henceforth exercising power as an absolute ruler.[5] In 1978 a new constitution was promulgated which provided for an elaborate reversion to a tribal mode of rule involving an electoral college of eighty members chosen by forty local councils known as tinkhundla, dominated by tribal elements. The Swazi economy prospered under Sobhuza's leadership. Swaziland is rich in natural resources, and much of the land and mineral wealth originally owned by non-Swazi interests was brought under indigenous control during Sobhuza's reign.[4]\n\n\n\n## Later life and death[edit]\n\n\n![](image)1959 Buick LeSabre, owned by Sobhuza II. Photographed at the Sobhuza II Memorial Park in Lobamba.\nSobhuza celebrated his Diamond Jubilee in 1981. At this time, he had successfully restored and indeed strengthened the monarch's role as the chief arbiter of decision-making in his kingdom.[4] In the early 1980s King Sobhuza attempted to acquire control over KaNgwane, a Bantustan set up by the South African government in an attempt to reunite all Swazi people separated by the colonial boundary. He died on 21 August 1982 at Embo State house at the age of 83.[9]\n\n\nSobhuza's official incumbency of 82 years and 254 days is the longest precisely dated monarchical reign on record and the world's longest documented reign of any sovereign since antiquity. Only Min Hti of the Burmese Kingdom of Arakan, Pepi II Neferkare of Ancient Egypt and Taejo of the ancient Korean kingdom of Goguryeo are claimed to have reigned longer, though these claims are disputed.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Family and succession[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mswati III, Sobhuza II's son and eventual successor\nKnown by the honorific \"Bull of Swazi\" by virtue of his numerous progeny,[10] King Sobhuza continued the tribal practice of maintaining many consorts. According to the Swaziland National Trust Commission, King Sobhuza II had 70 wives, who gave him 210 children between 1920 and 1970. About 180 children survived infancy, and 97 sons and daughters were reported living as of 2000. At his death he had more than 1,000 grandchildren.[11]\n\n\nSobhuza died in 1982, having appointed Prince Sozisa Dlamini to serve as 'Authorized Person', advising a regent. Selection of a successor was confirmed only after King Sobhuza's death, a regent being necessary if the heir remained under age at that time. By tradition, the regent would be one of the queens consort who had borne the late king a son.[5] The first regent was Queen Dzeliwe, but after a power struggle Sozisa deposed her and she was replaced by Queen Ntfombi. During this period Andy Warhol boosted her renown, and that of Swaziland, by including her portrait along with those of Elizabeth II of the Commonwealth Realms, Beatrix of the Netherlands and Margrethe II of Denmark in his *Reigning Queens* series.[12] Ntombi reigned on behalf of her young son by King Sobhuza, Prince Makhosetive Dlamini, who was designated as Crown Prince or *Umntfwana*. He was crowned King Mswati III in 1986.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nOne of Sobhuza's sons-in-law was the late Goodwill Zwelithini kaBhekuzulu, King of the Zulus of South Africa, who married the Swazi king's daughter, Princess Mantfombi (born at Siteki in 1956, betrothed in 1973), at Nongoma in June 1977.[5] Another in-law is Zenani Mandela, the daughter of former South African President Nelson Mandela, who belonged to a cadet branch of the Thembu dynasty which reigns as paramount chiefs in the Transkei. She wed Sobhuza's son, Prince Thumbumuzi Dlamini who, although an older half-brother of Mswati and Mantfombi,[5] did not inherit the Swazi throne, instead launching, with his wife, an enterprise in the United States.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Honours[edit]\n\n\n### National honours[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image) Grand Master of the Royal Order of the King Sobhuza II (Kingdom of Swaziland, 1975).[*citation needed*]\n\n\n### Foreign honours[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)\n\n\nHonorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire, Civil Division (KBE) (United Kingdom, 1 January 1966).[13]\n\n\nHonorary Commander of the Order of the British Empire, Civil Division (CBE) (United Kingdom, 8 June 1950.)[14]\n\n\nHonorary Officer of the Order of the British Empire, Civil Division (OBE) (United Kingdom, 11 May 1937).[15]\n\n\n\n* ![](image) Supreme Companion of the Order of the Companions of O.

Because of the many bloody feuds in which he was involved, he was nicknamed \"the Bellicose\". He is the longest-ever ruling European monarch.[1]\n\n\n\n\n## Life[edit]\n\n\nHe was the son of Lord Simon IV of Lippe and his wife, Margaret of Brunswick-Grubenhagen. He inherited Lippe in 1429, before his first birthday. He stood under the regency and guardianship of his uncle Otto. After Otto died in 1446, his great-uncle Archbishop Dietrich II of Cologne was appointed regent. Dietrich was represented in Lippe by his *Amtmann*, Johann Möllenbeck.\n\n\nIn 1444, Bernard VII concluded a treaty with Duke Adolph I of Cleves-Mark, in which he ceded to Adolph a 50% share in the city of Lippstadt, which had been mortgaged to Cleves. At the same time, he joined an alliance, which made him a party in the so-called Feud of Soest against Archbishop Dietrich II of Cologne. In 1447, Dietrich called in a Bohemian army, which devastated the countryside in Lippe and levelled the town of Blomberg to the ground. The Bohemians also besieged the cities of Lippstadt and Soest, but were unsuccessful.\n\n\nAfter the feud had been settled in 1449, Bernard took up residence at Blomberg Castle. In 1468, he moved to Detmold, which at the time was the smallest city in Lippe, with only 350 inhabitants. He expanded the Detmold Castle; an inscription in the old castle tower dated 1470 is a reminder of this.\n\n\nBernard was involved in a large number of feuds against various enemies, with shifting alliances. In 1469, he supported Landgrave Louis II, Landgrave of Lower Hesse against his brother Henry III, Landgrave of Upper Hesse. On the other hand, in 1464, he supported his own brother, Prince-Bishop Simon III of Paderborn against Louis II of Lower Hesse when they fought the Hesse-Paderborn Feud about Calenberg Castle.\n\n\n\n## Marriage and issue[edit]\n\n\nFrom his marriage to Anna, the daughter of Count Otto II of Holstein-Schauenburg, he had the following children:\n\n\n\n* Anna (b. c. 1450), married:\n\t1. Otto VI, Count of Hoya\n\t2. John II, Count of Nassau-Beilstein (d. 1513)\n* Margaret (b. c. 1452), married to John I, Count of Rietberg\n* Elisabeth (b. c. 1460), married:\n\t1.

He donated large tracts of land to build infrastructure of Ranchi city. He built the Ratu Palace in Ranchi in 1901.[1] He was conferred the Kaiser-i-Hind Medal for public services.[2][3] He reigned for 81 years, and 74 days, the longest-reigning Indian monarch, the longest-reigning Princely State ruler and third longest verifiable reign of any monarch in history.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nDeo was born on 23 March 1866 in Bharno. The king Jagannath Shah Deo died in 1869. As mentioned in Mangobinda Banargee's book \"Historical Outline of Pre-British Chotanagpur\", he was the nephew of Maharaja Jagannath Shah Deo. As Maharaja Jagannath Shah Deo had no sons, Udai Pratap Shah Deo succeeded to the throne after several court cases as other relatives of Maharaja claimed to be entitled to become king. Then the queen of King Jagannath Shah Deo, Luchun Kunwar shifted from Bharno to Ratu in 1879 and a palace was built in 1975.[4]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nDeo married Rajkumari Mohan Kumari, daughter of Maharaja Udit Narayan Singh Deo, Raja of Saraikela State, in 1881. Rajkumari Mohan Kumari died in 1905. His second marriage was to Saudamani Devi, daughter of Raja Ram Kanhai Singh of Barabhum Estate. He had eight sons and two daughters.[5][6]\n\n\n\n## Reign[edit]\n\n\nKing Udai Pratap Nath Shah Deo donated large tracts of the land in Ranchi to develop its infrastructure. He donated land for building Ranchi University, G.E.L church, Gossner College, Ranchi Club, Pepe compound and other institutions. He donated 320 acres of land to G.E.L. Church and 17 acres of land for the construction of Ranchi Club.[5] Ten thousand acres of land of McCluskieganj was built on his land.[7]\n\n\nHe built Ratu Palace in Ratu. The construction of Palace started in 1899 and completed in 1901. The Palace has 103 rooms and spread over 22 acres. It was constructed by British company of Kolkata and designed after Buckingham palace of Westminster, London.[1][5][8]\n\n\n\n## Death[edit]\n\n\nHe died in 1950. He was succeeded by his great-grandson, Lal Chintamani Sharan Nath Shahdeo.[5]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"बीच और हिल स्टेशन से अलग इस बार छुट्टियों में रांची आएं, जहां देखने को हैं काफी कुछ\". *jagran*. 20 November 2019.\n2. **^** \"Ratu royalty stands by kin - Cong loses traditional trump card to JVM in Hatia run-up\". *telegraphindia*. 20 May 2012.\n3. **^** \"The Nagbanshis And The Cheros\". *archive.org*.\n4. **^** Ansari, Tahir Hussain (20 June 2019). *Mughal Administration and the Zamindars of Bihar*.

When he was only four months old, his father died suddenly while dancing incwala. Sobhuza was chosen king soon after that and his grandmother Labotsibeni and his uncle Prince Malunge led the Swazi nation until his maturity in 1921.[3] Sobhuza was acknowledged as King by the British in 1967, and Swaziland achieved independence in 1968. Sobhuza continued to reign until his death in 1982. He was succeeded by Mswati III, his young son with Inkhosikati Ntfombi Tfwala, who was crowned in 1986.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nIngwenyama Sobhuza was born in Zombodze on 22 July 1899.[4] He ascended to the throne after the death of his father, Ngwane V, as King of Swaziland on 10 December 1899, when he was only four months old.[5] He was educated at the Swazi National School, Zombodze, and at the Lovedale Institution in the Eastern Cape, South Africa, before assuming the Swazi throne as King at the age of twenty-two.[4] His grandmother, Labotsibeni Mdluli, served as regent throughout his youth, formally transferring power to the *Ngwenyama* on 22 December 1921.[5] Before assuming his royal duties, he studied anthropology in England.[6]\n\n\n\n## Kingship[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nThe National Archives pictures of the Swazi royal family\n\nSobhuza's direct reign would endure more than 60 years (1921–1982), during which he presided over Swaziland's independence from the United Kingdom in 1968, after which the British government recognised him as *King of Swaziland* (Eswatini).[5] Early in his reign, Sobhuza sought to address the problem of land partition and deprivation instituted by the British authorities in 1907. He did so by first leading a delegation to London to meet with King George V and petition him to restore the lands to the Swazi people.[7] He again took his case on the land issue in 1929 to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. He was defeated by the terms of the Foreign Jurisdictions Act 1890, which effectively placed the actions of British administrations in protectorates beyond the reach of the British courts.[4] Sobhuza's role during this colonial period was for the most part ceremonial, but he still had major influence as a traditional head of the Swazi nation.[4] In 1934, he received the anthropologist Bronislaw Malinowski. In 1953, he attended the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in London.[8]\n\n\nIn the early 1960s Sobhuza played a major role in events that led to independence for his country in 1968. He opposed the post-colonial Westminster constitution proposed by the British government, in which he was assigned the role of constitutional monarch.[4] As a consequence, acting through his advisory council, he formed the *Imbokodvo National Movement*, a political party, which contested and won all seats in the 1967 pre-independence elections.[4] He became recognized by the British as King of Swaziland in 1967 when Swaziland was given direct rule. Independence was achieved on 6 September 1968. Following this, Sobhuza skilfully blended appeal to tribal custom with a capacity to manage economic and social change for his kingdom.[4] On 12 April 1973, the king repealed the constitution and dissolved parliament, henceforth exercising power as an absolute ruler.[5] In 1978 a new constitution was promulgated which provided for an elaborate reversion to a tribal mode of rule involving an electoral college of eighty members chosen by forty local councils known as tinkhundla, dominated by tribal elements. The Swazi economy prospered under Sobhuza's leadership. Swaziland is rich in natural resources, and much of the land and mineral wealth originally owned by non-Swazi interests was brought under indigenous control during Sobhuza's reign.[4]\n\n\n\n## Later life and death[edit]\n\n\n![](image)1959 Buick LeSabre, owned by Sobhuza II. Photographed at the Sobhuza II Memorial Park in Lobamba.\nSobhuza celebrated his Diamond Jubilee in 1981. At this time, he had successfully restored and indeed strengthened the monarch's role as the chief arbiter of decision-making in his kingdom.[4] In the early 1980s King Sobhuza attempted to acquire control over KaNgwane, a Bantustan set up by the South African government in an attempt to reunite all Swazi people separated by the colonial boundary. He died on 21 August 1982 at Embo State house at the age of 83.[9]\n\n\nSobhuza's official incumbency of 82 years and 254 days is the longest precisely dated monarchical reign on record and the world's longest documented reign of any sovereign since antiquity. Only Min Hti of the Burmese Kingdom of Arakan, Pepi II Neferkare of Ancient Egypt and Taejo of the ancient Korean kingdom of Goguryeo are claimed to have reigned longer, though these claims are disputed.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Family and succession[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mswati III, Sobhuza II's son and eventual successor\nKnown by the honorific \"Bull of Swazi\" by virtue of his numerous progeny,[10] King Sobhuza continued the tribal practice of maintaining many consorts. According to the Swaziland National Trust Commission, King Sobhuza II had 70 wives, who gave him 210 children between 1920 and 1970. About 180 children survived infancy, and 97 sons and daughters were reported living as of 2000. At his death he had more than 1,000 grandchildren.[11]\n\n\nSobhuza died in 1982, having appointed Prince Sozisa Dlamini to serve as 'Authorized Person', advising a regent. Selection of a successor was confirmed only after King Sobhuza's death, a regent being necessary if the heir remained under age at that time. By tradition, the regent would be one of the queens consort who had borne the late king a son.[5] The first regent was Queen Dzeliwe, but after a power struggle Sozisa deposed her and she was replaced by Queen Ntfombi. During this period Andy Warhol boosted her renown, and that of Swaziland, by including her portrait along with those of Elizabeth II of the Commonwealth Realms, Beatrix of the Netherlands and Margrethe II of Denmark in his *Reigning Queens* series.[12] Ntombi reigned on behalf of her young son by King Sobhuza, Prince Makhosetive Dlamini, who was designated as Crown Prince or *Umntfwana*. He was crowned King Mswati III in 1986.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nOne of Sobhuza's sons-in-law was the late Goodwill Zwelithini kaBhekuzulu, King of the Zulus of South Africa, who married the Swazi king's daughter, Princess Mantfombi (born at Siteki in 1956, betrothed in 1973), at Nongoma in June 1977.[5] Another in-law is Zenani Mandela, the daughter of former South African President Nelson Mandela, who belonged to a cadet branch of the Thembu dynasty which reigns as paramount chiefs in the Transkei. She wed Sobhuza's son, Prince Thumbumuzi Dlamini who, although an older half-brother of Mswati and Mantfombi,[5] did not inherit the Swazi throne, instead launching, with his wife, an enterprise in the United States.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Honours[edit]\n\n\n### National honours[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image) Grand Master of the Royal Order of the King Sobhuza II (Kingdom of Swaziland, 1975).[*citation needed*]\n\n\n### Foreign honours[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)\n\n\nHonorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire, Civil Division (KBE) (United Kingdom, 1 January 1966).[13]\n\n\nHonorary Commander of the Order of the British Empire, Civil Division (CBE) (United Kingdom, 8 June 1950.)[14]\n\n\nHonorary Officer of the Order of the British Empire, Civil Division (OBE) (United Kingdom, 11 May 1937).[15]\n\n\n\n* ![](image) Supreme Companion of the Order of the Companions of O.

Because of the many bloody feuds in which he was involved, he was nicknamed \"the Bellicose\". He is the longest-ever ruling European monarch.[1]\n\n\n\n\n## Life[edit]\n\n\nHe was the son of Lord Simon IV of Lippe and his wife, Margaret of Brunswick-Grubenhagen. He inherited Lippe in 1429, before his first birthday. He stood under the regency and guardianship of his uncle Otto. After Otto died in 1446, his great-uncle Archbishop Dietrich II of Cologne was appointed regent. Dietrich was represented in Lippe by his *Amtmann*, Johann Möllenbeck.\n\n\nIn 1444, Bernard VII concluded a treaty with Duke Adolph I of Cleves-Mark, in which he ceded to Adolph a 50% share in the city of Lippstadt, which had been mortgaged to Cleves. At the same time, he joined an alliance, which made him a party in the so-called Feud of Soest against Archbishop Dietrich II of Cologne. In 1447, Dietrich called in a Bohemian army, which devastated the countryside in Lippe and levelled the town of Blomberg to the ground. The Bohemians also besieged the cities of Lippstadt and Soest, but were unsuccessful.\n\n\nAfter the feud had been settled in 1449, Bernard took up residence at Blomberg Castle. In 1468, he moved to Detmold, which at the time was the smallest city in Lippe, with only 350 inhabitants. He expanded the Detmold Castle; an inscription in the old castle tower dated 1470 is a reminder of this.\n\n\nBernard was involved in a large number of feuds against various enemies, with shifting alliances. In 1469, he supported Landgrave Louis II, Landgrave of Lower Hesse against his brother Henry III, Landgrave of Upper Hesse. On the other hand, in 1464, he supported his own brother, Prince-Bishop Simon III of Paderborn against Louis II of Lower Hesse when they fought the Hesse-Paderborn Feud about Calenberg Castle.\n\n\n\n## Marriage and issue[edit]\n\n\nFrom his marriage to Anna, the daughter of Count Otto II of Holstein-Schauenburg, he had the following children:\n\n\n\n* Anna (b. c. 1450), married:\n\t1. Otto VI, Count of Hoya\n\t2. John II, Count of Nassau-Beilstein (d. 1513)\n* Margaret (b. c. 1452), married to John I, Count of Rietberg\n* Elisabeth (b. c. 1460), married:\n\t1.

He built the Ratu Palace in Ranchi in 1901.[1] He was conferred the Kaiser-i-Hind Medal for public services.[2][3] He reigned for 81 years, and 74 days, the longest-reigning Indian monarch, the longest-reigning Princely State ruler and third longest verifiable reign of any monarch in history.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nDeo was born on 23 March 1866 in Bharno. The king Jagannath Shah Deo died in 1869. As mentioned in Mangobinda Banargee's book \"Historical Outline of Pre-British Chotanagpur\", he was the nephew of Maharaja Jagannath Shah Deo. As Maharaja Jagannath Shah Deo had no sons, Udai Pratap Shah Deo succeeded to the throne after several court cases as other relatives of Maharaja claimed to be entitled to become king.

He donated land for building Ranchi University, G.E.L church, Gossner College, Ranchi Club, Pepe compound and other institutions. He donated 320 acres of land to G.E.L. Church and 17 acres of land for the construction of Ranchi Club.[5] Ten thousand acres of land of McCluskieganj was built on his land.[7]\n\n\nHe built Ratu Palace in Ratu. The construction of Palace started in 1899 and completed in 1901. The Palace has 103 rooms and spread over 22 acres. It was constructed by British company of Kolkata and designed after Buckingham palace of Westminster, London.[1][5][8]\n\n\n\n## Death[edit]\n\n\nHe died in 1950.

However, when the last Count George Ernest of Henneberg died, both the Ernestine and the Albertine branch of the Wettin dynasty claimed his estates, that were finally divided in 1660 among the Ernestine duchies of Saxe-Weimar and Saxe-Gotha and the Albertine duke Maurice of Saxe-Zeitz. The Lordship of Schmalkalden fell to Landgrave William IV of Hesse-Kassel, according to an inheritance treaty of 1360.\n\n\nAfter the Congress of Vienna (1815), the former Albertine parts around Schleusingen and Suhl fell to the Prussian province of Saxony.

Count Berthold VII of Henneberg-Schleusingen (1272–1340) was elevated to princely status in 1310, his estates comprised the towns of Schmalkalden, Suhl and Coburg. In 1343 the Counts of Hennberg also purchased the Thuringian town of Ilmenau. The Coburg lands passed to the Saxon House of Wettin upon the marriage of Countess Catherine of Henneberg to Margrave Frederick III of Meissen in 1347.\n\n\nAfter the Imperial Reform of 1500, the County of Henneberg formed the northernmost part of the Franconian Circle, bordering on the Upper Saxon Ernestine duchies and the lands of the Upper Rhenish prince-abbacy of Fulda in the northwest. A thorn in the side remained the enclave of Meiningen, a fief held by the Bishops of Würzburg, which was not acquired by the counts until 1542.\n\n\n\n## Disestablishment\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | Sons of Berthold VII, ruled jointly.

In 1096 one Count Godebold II of Henneberg served as a burgrave of the Würzburg bishops, his father Poppo had been killed in battle in 1078.

He was the son of William II of Henneberg and Catherine of Hanau. William III inherited the princely county of Henneberg in 1440, when his father died in a hunting accident. In 1469, he married Margaret (1451 – 13 February 1509), the daughter of Duke Henry the Peaceful of Brunswick-Lüneburg.[1]\n\n\nIn 1463 or 1464, the imperial city of Schweinfurt transferred the office of Imperial bailiff to William and made him patron of the city.[2] This combination of competencies offered Schweinfurt some degree of protection against the Bishopric of Würzburg.[3] Apparently out of personal piety, William promoted pilgrimages and founded churches and monasteries.[4]\n\n\nWilliam died in 1480 in Salorno, when he was returning from Rome. His grave stone can be found in the Assumption of Mary Church in Bolzano, near the altar. In 1482, his body was transferred to the Henneberg family vault in the church of the monastery at Kloster Veßra.[5] The epitaph in Bolzano was sculpted by Erasmus Forster in Gardolo near Trento and installed in the Church in 1495 or 1496. Like his father, he left only underage children, including his heir, William IV. His widow, however, succeeded in securing their inheritance.[2]\n\n\n\n## Footnotes\n\n[edit]\n\n1. **^** Franziskus Lubecus and Reinhard Vogelsang (eds.): *Göttinger Annalen.
