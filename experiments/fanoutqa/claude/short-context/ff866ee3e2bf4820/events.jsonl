The university's central campus sits on a 15-acre (6.1-hectare) block bounded by Waterman, Prospect, George, and Thayer Streets; newer buildings extend northward, eastward, and southward. Brown's core, historic campus, constructed primary between 1770 and 1926, is defined by three greens: the Front or Quiet Green, the Middle or College Green, and the Ruth J. Simmons Quadrangle (historically known as Lincoln Field).[57][58] A brick and wrought-iron fence punctuated by decorative gates and arches traces the block's perimeter. This section of campus is primarily Georgian and Richardsonian Romanesque in its architectural character.[57]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBrown is the largest institutional landowner in Providence, with properties on College Hill and in the Jewelry District.[55] The university was built contemporaneously with the eighteenth and nineteenth-century precincts surrounding it, making Brown's campus tightly integrated into Providence's urban fabric. Among the noted architects who have shaped Brown's campus are McKim, Mead & White, Philip Johnson, Rafael Viñoly, Diller Scofidio + Renfro, and Robert A. M. Stern.[56]\n\n\n\n### Main campus[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nEast Campus, centered on Hope and Charlesfield streets, originally served as the campus of Bryant University. In 1969, as Bryant was preparing to relocate to Smithfield, Rhode Island, Brown purchased their Providence campus for $5 million. The transaction expanded the Brown campus by 10 acres (40,000 m2) and 26 buildings. In 1971, Brown renamed the area East Campus.[74] Today, the area is largely used for dormitories.\n\n\nThayer Street runs through Brown's main campus. As a commercial corridor frequented by students, Thayer is comparable to Harvard Square or Berkeley's Telegraph Avenue. Wickenden Street, in the adjacent Fox Point neighborhood, is another commercial street similarly popular among students.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBrown's School of Public Health occupies a landmark modernist building along the Providence River. Other Brown properties include the 376-acre (1.52 km2) Mount Hope Grant in Bristol, Rhode Island, an important Native American site noted as a location of King Philip's War. Brown's Haffenreffer Museum of Anthropology Collection Research Center, particularly strong in Native American items, is located in the Mount Hope Grant.\n\n\n\n### Sustainability[edit]\n\n\nBrown has committed to \"minimize its energy use, reduce negative environmental impacts, and promote environmental stewardship.\"[78] Since 2010, the university has required all new buildings meet LEED silver standards.[79] Between 2007 and 2018, Brown reduced its greenhouse emissions by 27 percent; the majority of this reduction is attributable to the university's Thermal Efficiency Project which converted its central heating plant from a steam-powered system to a hot water-powered system.[80]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe university comprises the College, the Graduate School, Alpert Medical School, the School of Engineering, the School of Public Health and the School of Professional Studies. Its international programs are organized through the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs, and it is academically affiliated with the Marine Biological Laboratory and the Rhode Island School of Design; with the latter, it offers undergraduate and graduate dual degree programs.\n\n\nBrown's main campus is in the College Hill neighborhood of Providence, Rhode Island. The university is surrounded by a federally listed architectural district with a dense concentration of Colonial-era buildings. Benefit Street, which runs along the campus's western edge, has one of America's richest concentrations of 17th- and 18th-century architecture.[14][15] Brown's undergraduate admissions are among the most selective in the country, with an overall acceptance rate of 5% for the class of 2026.[16][17]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBuilt in 1925, Brown Stadium—the home of the school's football team—is located approximately a mile and a half northeast of the university's central campus.[75] Marston Boathouse, the home of Brown's crew teams, lies on the Seekonk River, to the southeast of campus. Brown's sailing teams are based out of the Ted Turner Sailing Pavilion at the Edgewood Yacht Club in adjacent Cranston.\n\n\nSince 2011, Brown's Warren Alpert Medical School has been located in Providence's historic Jewelry District, near the medical campus of Brown's teaching hospitals, Rhode Island Hospital and the Women and Infants Hospital of Rhode Island. Other university facilities, including molecular medicine labs and administrative offices, are likewise located in the area.[76][77]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBrown University| File:Langfr-150px-Université Brown (logo).pngCoat of arms\n |\n| Latin: *Universitas Brunensis* |\n| Former names\n | Rhode Island College (1764–1804) |\n| Motto | *In Deo Speramus* (Latin) |\n| Motto in English\n | \"In God We Hope\"[1] |\n| Type | Private research university |\n| Established | September 15, 1764; 259 years ago (1764-09-15) |\n| Accreditation | NECHE |\n| Academic affiliations\n | * AAU\n* COFHE\n* URA\n* NAICU\n* Space-grant\n |\n| Endowment | $6.6 billion (2023)[2] |\n| President | Christina Paxson |\n| Provost | Francis J.

[83]\n\n\nAccording to the A. W. Kuchler U.S. potential natural vegetation types, Brown would have a dominant vegetation type of Appalachian Oak (*104*) with a dominant vegetation form of Eastern Hardwood Forest (*25*).[84]\n\n\n\n## Academics[edit]\n\n\n### The College[edit]\n\n\nMain article: College of Brown University\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTo the south of the central campus are academic buildings and residential quadrangles, including Wriston, Keeney, and Gregorian quadrangles. Immediately to the east of the campus core sit Sciences Park and Brown's School of Engineering. North of the central campus are performing and visual arts facilities, life sciences labs, and the Pembroke Campus, which houses both dormitories and academic buildings. Facing the western edge of the central campus sit two of the Brown's seven libraries, the John Hay Library and the John D. Rockefeller Jr. Library.\n\n\nThe university's campus is contiguous with that of the Rhode Island School of Design, which is located immediately to Brown's west, along the slope of College Hill.\n\n\n\n#### Van Wickle Gates[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Van Wickle Gates\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Brown University Admission Facts and Figures\".

It is the seventh-oldest institution of higher education in the United States, founded in 1764 as the **College in the English Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations**. One of nine colonial colleges chartered before the American Revolution,[6] it was the first college in the United States to codify in its charter that admission and instruction of students was to be equal regardless of their religious affiliation.[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1770, the college moved from Warren to Providence. To establish a campus, John and Moses Brown purchased a four-acre lot on the crest of College Hill on behalf of the school. The majority of the property fell within the bounds of the original home lot of Chad Brown, an ancestor of the Browns and one of the original proprietors of Providence Plantations.[34] After the college was relocated to the city, work began on constructing its first building.\n\n\nA building committee, organized by the corporation, developed plans for the college's first purpose-built edifice, finalizing a design on February 9, 1770. The subsequent structure, referred to as \"The College Edifice\" and later as University Hall, may have been modeled on Nassau Hall, built 14 years prior at the College of New Jersey. President Manning, an active member of the building process, was educated at Princeton and might have suggested that Brown's first building resemble that of his alma mater.[35]\n\n\n\n#### Brown family[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Admit rate | 4% (![Steady](image) +0.67)\n |\n| Yield rate | 62.05% (![Increase](image) +1.25)\n |\n| Test scores middle 50% |\n| SAT EBRW | 750–780 |\n| SAT Math | 750–790 |\n| ACT Composite | 34–36 |\n| High school GPA[i] |\n| Top 10% | 95% (![Increase](image) +4.7)\n |\n| 1. **^** Among students whose school ranked\n |\n\n\n### Undergraduate[edit]\n\n\nUndergraduate admission to Brown University is considered \"most selective\" by *U.S. News & World Report.*[146] For the undergraduate class of 2026, Brown received 50,649 applications—the largest applicant pool in the university's history and a 9% increase from the prior year.

The campus was designed along Beaux-Arts planning principles by the architects McKim, Mead & White. Columbia's main campus occupies more than six city blocks, or 32 acres (13 ha), in Morningside Heights, New York City, a neighborhood that contains a number of academic institutions. The university owns over 7,800 apartments in Morningside Heights, housing faculty, graduate students, and staff. Almost two dozen undergraduate dormitories (purpose-built or converted) are located on campus or in Morningside Heights. Columbia University has an extensive tunnel system, more than a century old, with the oldest portions predating the present campus. Some of these remain accessible to the public, while others have been cordoned off.[94]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn April 2007, the university purchased more than two-thirds of a 17 acres (6.9 ha) site for a new campus in Manhattanville, an industrial neighborhood to the north of the Morningside Heights campus. Stretching from 125th Street to 133rd Street, Columbia Manhattanville houses buildings for Columbia's Business School, School of International and Public Affairs, Columbia School of the Arts, and the Jerome L. Greene Center for Mind, Brain, and Behavior, where research will occur on neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's.[108][109] The $7 billion expansion plan included demolishing all buildings, except three that are historically significant (the Studebaker Building, Prentis Hall, and the Nash Building), eliminating the existing light industry and storage warehouses, and relocating tenants in 132 apartments. Replacing these buildings created 6.8 million square feet (630,000 m2) of space for the university. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Access to Columbia is enhanced by the 116th Street–Columbia University subway station (1 train) on the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line.\nAccording to the A. W. Kuchler U.S. potential natural vegetation types, Columbia University would have a dominant vegetation type of Appalachian Oak (*104*) with a dominant vegetation form of Eastern Hardwood Forest (*25*).[121]\n\n\n\n### Transportation[edit]\n\n\nColumbia Transportation is the bus service of the university, operated by Academy Bus Lines. The buses are open to all Columbia faculty, students, Dodge Fitness Center members, and anyone else who holds a Columbia ID card. In addition, all TSC students can ride the buses.[122]\n\n\nIn the New York City Subway, the ![\"1\" train](image) train serves the university at 116th Street-Columbia University.

Wien Stadium as well as facilities for field sports, outdoor track, and tennis. There is a third campus on the west bank of the Hudson River, the 157-acre (64 ha) Lamont–Doherty Earth Observatory and Earth Institute in Palisades, New York. A fourth is the 60-acre (24 ha) Nevis Laboratories in Irvington, New York, for the study of particle and motion physics.

For much of the 19th century, the university consisted of decentralized and separate faculties specializing in Political Science, Philosophy, and Pure Science. In 1979, these faculties were merged into the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.[92] In 1991, the faculties of Columbia College, the School of General Studies, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, the School of the Arts, and the School of Professional Studies were merged into the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, leading to the academic integration and centralized governance of these schools. In 2010, the School of International and Public Affairs, which was previously a part of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, became an independent faculty.[93]\n\n\n\n## Campus[edit]\n\n\n### Morningside Heights[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | * NCAA Division I FCS – Ivy League\n* EARC\n* IRA\n* EAWRC\n |\n| Mascot | Roar-ee the Lion |\n| Website | columbia.edu |\n| File:Columbia University logo.svg |\n\n\n**Columbia University**, officially **Columbia University in the City of New York**,[9] is a private Ivy League research university in New York City.

It was renamed Columbia College in 1784 following the American Revolution, and in 1787 was placed under a private board of trustees headed by former students Alexander Hamilton and John Jay. In 1896, the campus was moved to its current location in Morningside Heights and renamed Columbia University.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n118. **^** \"Columbia Greenmarket\". GrowNYC.

The campus has expanded to approximately 745 acres (301 ha) since its founding, comprising academic buildings, laboratories, administrative facilities, athletic centers, auditoriums, museums, and residential areas.[36][37] In 2011, *Travel+Leisure* recognized the Ithaca Campus as one of the most beautiful in the United States, praising its unique blend of architectural styles, historic landmarks, and picturesque surroundings.[38]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Ithaca campus is located in the Finger Lakes region and has views of the city, Cayuga Lake, and the surrounding valleys. The campus is bordered by two gorges, Fall Creek Gorge and Cascadilla Gorge, which contribute to the university's natural landscape. Although these gorges are popular swimming spots during warmer months, their use is discouraged by the university and city code due to potential safety hazards.[49] Adjacent to the main campus, Cornell owns the 2,800-acre (1,100 ha) Cornell Botanic Gardens, featuring various plants, trees, and ponds. The gardens' trails allow visitors to explore the natural surroundings.[50]\n\n\n\n#### Sustainability[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMain articles: Cornell Central Campus, Cornell North Campus, and Cornell West Campus\n\nCentral Campus is the heart of the university, housing the majority of academic and administrative facilities. The architectural styles on Central Campus range from ornate Collegiate Gothic, Victorian, and Neoclassical buildings to more spare international, and modernist structures. Frederick Law Olmsted, the designer of Central Park, proposed a \"grand terrace\" overlooking Cayuga Lake in one of the earliest plans for the campus.[43]\n\n\nNorth Campus features primarily residential buildings, with ten residence halls designed to accommodate first and second-year students, as well as transfer students in the Townhouse Community.,[44] The architectural styles of North Campus are more modern, reflecting the growth of the university and the need for additional housing during the mid-20th century.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Nickname | Big Red |\n| Sporting affiliations\n | * NCAA Division I FCS – Ivy League\n* IRA\n* EARC\n* EAWRC\n |\n| Mascot | Touchdown the Bear (unofficial)[8] |\n| Website | www.cornell.edu |\n| ![](image) |\n\n\n**Cornell University** is a private Ivy League land-grant research university based in Ithaca, New York. The university was founded in 1865 by Ezra Cornell and Andrew Dickson White. Since its founding, Cornell has been a co-educational, non-sectarian institution where admission has not been restricted by religion or race. The student body for the fall 2022 semester consisted of more than 15,000 undergraduate and 7,000 graduate students from all 50 American states and 130 countries.[4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPrivate university in Ithaca, New York, U.S.\n\n\"Cornell\" redirects here.

These offices provide programs in agriculture and food systems, children, youth and families, community and economic vitality, environment and natural resources, and nutrition and health.[87] Additionally, the university operates New York's Animal Health Diagnostic Center, which serves as a valuable resource for animal disease control and husbandry.[88]\n\n\n\n## Organization and administration[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| **College/school founding** |\n| --- |\n| **College/school** | **Year founded** |\n| \n\n---\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCornell's off-campus research facilities include Shoals Marine Laboratory, a seasonal marine field station on Appledore Island off the Maine–New Hampshire coast, is operated in conjunction with the University of New Hampshire and focuses on undergraduate education and research.[74] Until 2011, Cornell operated the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico, which was the site of the world's largest single-dish radio telescope.[75]\n\n\nThe university also maintains several facilities dedicated to conservation and ecology, such as the New York State Agricultural Experiment Station in Geneva, New York. This station operates three substations, including the Cornell Lake Erie Research and Extension Laboratory in Portland,[76] the Hudson Valley Laboratory in Highland,[77] and the Long Island Horticultural Research Laboratory in Riverhead.[78] The Cornell Lab of Ornithology in Ithaca conducts research on biological diversity, primarily in birds,[79]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)A World War I memorial on Cornell's West Campus in Ithaca\n![](image)Cornell's Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art designed by I. M. Pei\n![](image)The A.D. White Reading Room contains much of the 30,000 volume collection donated to the university by its co-founder and first president.\nCornell University owns and operates a variety of off-campus research facilities and offers study abroad and scholarship programs.[73] These facilities and programs contribute to the university's research endeavors and provide students with unique learning opportunities.\n\n\n\n#### Research facilities[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCornell's nine privately endowed, non-statutory colleges include the College of Arts and Sciences, College of Engineering, College of Architecture, Art, and Planning, and College of Hotel Administration. These colleges operate independently of state funding and oversight, giving them greater autonomy in determining their academic programs, admissions, and advising. They also do not offer discounted tuition for New York residents.\n\n\nOf the 15,182 undergraduate students at Cornell, 4,602 (30.3%) are affiliated with the largest college by enrollment, Arts and Sciences, followed by 3,203 (21.1%) in Engineering and 3,101 (20.4%) in Agriculture and Life Sciences. The smallest of the seven undergraduate colleges is Architecture, Art, and Planning, with 503 (3.3%) students.[4] The only university-wide requirements for a baccalaureate degree are to pass a swimming test, take two physical education courses, and satisfy a writing requirement. \n\n\n\n### Fundraising and financial support[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Cornell University Mission\".

By 2022, the university aims to add 2,000 beds on North Campus. Five new dorms and a dining hall will be created, three of which will be located in Appel Field and will be exclusive for freshmen. Sophomores will have two new dorms located in the current CC Parking Lot.[224]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCornell University is a non-profit organization with a decentralized structure where colleges and schools exercise wide autonomy in defining academic programs, admissions, advising, and conferring degrees. The university comprises nine privately endowed colleges and four publicly supported statutory colleges, offering undergraduate, graduate, and professional programs. Cornell operates eCornell for online professional development and certificate programs[89] and participates in New York's land-grant, sea-grant, and space-grant programs.[90][91]\n\n\n\n### Governance and administration[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAdmission to Cornell University is highly competitive. In spring of 2022 (Class of 2026), Cornell's undergraduate programs received 71,164 applications and admitted only 5,168 for a 7.2% acceptance rate.[116] For Fall 2019 enrolling freshmen, the middle 50% range of SAT scores were 680–760 for evidence-based reading and writing and 720–800 for mathematics.[117] The middle 50% range of the ACT composite score was 32–35.[117]\n\n\nThe university continues to attract a diverse and inclusive student body. The proportion of admitted students who self-identify as underrepresented minorities increased to 34.2% from 33.7% in 2021, and 59.3% self-identify as students of color. That number has increased steadily over the past five years, enrollment officials said, from 52.5% in 2017 and 57.2% in 2020.\n\n\nOf those admitted, 1,163 will be first-generation college students, another increase over 2020's 844.[118] The university is need-blind for domestic applicants.[119]\n\n\n\n### Financial aid[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n114. **^** \"Academic Calendar 2010–2011 – 2014–2015\" (PDF).

Dubbed the Postal Lands, the site extends from Market Street on the north to Penn's Bower Field on the south, including the former main regional U.S. Postal Building at 30th and Market Streets, now the regional office for the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. Over the next decade, the site became the home to educational, research, biomedical, and mixed-use facilities. The first phase, comprising a park and athletic facilities, opened in the fall of 2011.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe University of Pennsylvania's main campus is located in the University City neighborhood of West Philadelphia, and is centered around College Hall. Notable campus landmarks include Houston Hall, the first modern student union, and Franklin Field, the nation's first dual-level college football stadium and the nation's longest-standing NCAA Division I college football stadium in continuous operation.[15] The university's athletics program, the Penn Quakers, fields varsity teams in 33 sports as a member of NCAA Division I's Ivy League conference.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n112. **^** Helmer, Madeleine (March 16, 2017). \"Tracking The Evolution Of Industry At 34th And Grays Ferry\".

But in addition to a significant student population from the Delaware Valley, the university continued to attract international students from at least 50 countries and from all 50 states as early as of the second decade of the 1920s.[84][87] Penn Trustee Paul Miller wrote that, in the post-World War II era,: \"[t]he bricks-and-mortar Capital Campaign of the Sixties...built the facilities that turned Penn from a commuter school to a residential one....\"[88] By 1961, 79% of male undergraduates and 57% of female undergraduates lived on campus.[89]\n\n\n\n### Controversies[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)A c. 1815 illustration of the Ninth Street campus of the University of Pennsylvania, including the medical department (on left) and the college building (on right), which was originally intended to serve as the residence for the President of the United States before the national capital was moved from Philadelphia to Washington, D.C. in 1800\n![](image)A ticket to an 1807 lecture by Benjamin Rush, then a professor at Penn's Department of Medicine[61]\n![](image)The Ninth Street Campus, located on the west side of Ninth Street between Market and Chestnut Streets, and a hand-colored lithograph created in 1842 by John Caspar Wild of Medical Hall (on left) and College Hall (on right), both built between 1829 and 1830\n![](image)The Ninth Street Campus above Chestnut Street and Medical Hall just prior to the university's 1871 move to its current location in West Philadelphia\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 2010, in its first significant expansion across the Schuylkill River, Penn purchased 23 acres (9.3 ha) at the northwest corner of 34th Street and Grays Ferry Avenue, the then site of DuPont Marshall Research Labs.

It was built between 1924 and 1928 at a cost of $2.3 million,[203] approximately $40.8 million adjusted for inflation in 2020. Ralph Adams Cram, the university's supervising architect, designed the chapel, which he viewed as the crown jewel for the Collegiate Gothic motif he had championed for the campus.[204] At the time of its construction, it was the second largest university chapel in the world, after King's College Chapel, Cambridge.[205] It underwent a two-year, $10 million restoration campaign between 2000 and 2002.[206] The Chapel seats around 2,000 and serves as a site for religious services and local celebrations.[207]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe university has ties with the Institute for Advanced Study,[221] Princeton Theological Seminary, Rutgers University, and the Westminster Choir College of Rider University.[222] Princeton is a member of the Association of American Universities,[223] the Universities Research Association,[224] and the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities.[225] The university is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE), with its last reaffirmation in 2014.[226]\n\n\n\n### Finances[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPrivate university in Princeton, New Jersey\n\n\"Princeton\" redirects here.

They can also participate in 55 interdisciplinary certificate programs;[217] since Princeton does not offer an academic minor, the certificates effectively serve as one.[237] Course structure is determined by the instructor and department. Classes vary in their format, ranging from small seminars to medium-sized lecture courses to large lecture courses.[238] The latter two typically have precepts, which are extra weekly discussion sessions that are led by either the professor or a graduate student.[238][239] The average class meeting time is 3–4 hours a week, although this can vary depending on the course.[238] The student to faculty ratio is 5 to 1,[239] and a majority of classes have fewer than 20 students.[234] In the *Fiske Guide to Colleges*, academic culture is considered as \"tight-knit, extremely hardworking, highly cooperative, and supportive.\"[69]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n160. **^** \"Princeton University: An Interactive Campus History.

As part of this commitment, the university allocates renewable energy credits to offset some of the energy used by residential colleges.[135] Eleven campus buildings are candidates for LEED design and certification.[136] Yale Sustainable Food Project initiated the introduction of local, organic vegetables, fruits, and beef to all residential college dining halls.[137] Yale was listed as a Campus Sustainability Leader on the Sustainable Endowments Institute's College Sustainability Report Card 2008, and received a \"B+\" grade overall.[138] Yale is a member of the Ivy Plus Sustainability Consortium, through which it has committed to best-practice sharing and the ongoing exchange of campus sustainability solutions along with other member institutions.[139]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2004, the national non-profit watchdog group Security on Campus filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education, accusing Yale of under-reporting rape and sexual assaults.[150][151]\n\n\nIn April 2021, Yale announced that it will require students to receive a COVID-19 vaccine as a condition of being on campus during the fall 2021 term.[152]\n\n\n\n## Academics[edit]\n\n\n### Admissions[edit]\n\n\nUndergraduate admission to Yale College is considered \"most selective\" by *U.S. News*.[153][154] In 2022, Yale accepted 2,234 students to the Class of 2026 out of 50,015 applicants, for an acceptance rate of 4.46%.[155] 98% of students graduate within six years.[156]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nYale is noted for its largely Collegiate Gothic campus[117] as well as several iconic modern buildings commonly discussed in architectural history survey courses: Louis Kahn's Yale Art Gallery[118] and Center for British Art, Eero Saarinen's Ingalls Rink and Ezra Stiles and Morse Colleges, and Paul Rudolph's Art & Architecture Building. Yale also owns and has restored many noteworthy 19th-century mansions along Hillhouse Avenue, which was considered the most beautiful street in America by Charles Dickens when he visited the United States in the 1840s.[119] In 2011, Travel+Leisure listed the Yale campus as one of the most beautiful in the United States.[120]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHalf of all Yale undergraduates are women, more than 39% are ethnic minority U.S. citizens (19% are underrepresented minorities), and 10.5% are international students.[158] 55% attended public schools and 45% attended private, religious, or international schools, and 97% of students were in the top 10% of their high school class.[156] Every year, Yale College also admits a small group of non-traditional students through the Eli Whitney Students Program.\n\n\n\n### Collections[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Yale University's Sterling Memorial Library, as seen from Maya Lin's sculpture, *Women's Table*. The sculpture records the number of women enrolled at Yale over its history; female undergraduates were not admitted until 1969.\nYale University Library, which holds over 15 million volumes, is the third-largest university collection in the United States.[9][162] The main library, Sterling Memorial Library, contains about 4 million volumes, and other holdings are dispersed at subject and location libraries.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n137. **^** \"Yale Sustainable Food Program\".

Under President Levin, Yale has financially supported many of New Haven's efforts to reinvigorate the city. Evidence suggests that the town and gown relationships are mutually beneficial. Still, the economic power of the university increased dramatically with its financial success amid a decline in the local economy.[143]\n\n\n\n#### Campus safety[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nYale is a research university, with the majority of its students in the graduate and professional schools. Undergraduates, or Yale College students, come from a variety of ethnic, national, socioeconomic, and personal backgrounds. Of the 2010–2011 freshman class, 10% are non‑U.S. citizens, while 54% went to public high schools.[184] The median family income of Yale students is $192,600, with 57% of students coming from the top 10% highest-earning families and 16% from the bottom 60%.[185]\n\n\n\n### Residential colleges[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Residential colleges of Yale University\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n117. **^** Assorted pictures of Yale's campus Archived October 3, 2019, at the Wayback Machine.
