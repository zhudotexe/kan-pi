Thus, he attends Hogwarts to practise magic under the guidance of the kindly headmaster Albus Dumbledore and other school professors along with his best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. Harry also discovers that he is already famous throughout the novel's magical community, and that his fate is tied with that of Lord Voldemort \u2013 the internationally feared Dark Wizard and murderer of his parents, James and Lily Potter.

H. White's novel *The Once and Future King* is \"Harry's spiritual ancestor\".[4] Finally, she established Harry's birth date as 31 July, the same as her own. However, she maintained that Harry was not directly based on any real-life person: \"he came just out of a part of me\".[5]\n\n\nRowling has also maintained that Harry is a suitable real-life role model for children. \"The advantage of a fictional hero or heroine is that you can know them better than you can know a living hero, many of whom you would never meet\u00a0... if people like Harry and identify with him, I am pleased, because I think he is very likeable.\"[6]\n\n\n\n## Appearances[edit]\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n7. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Jensen, Jeff (7 September 2000). \"'Fire' Storm\". *Entertainment Weekly*.

According to Rowling, after Voldemort's defeat, Harry joins the \"reshuffled\" Auror Department under Kingsley Shacklebolt's mentoring, and ends up eventually rising to become Head of said department in 2007.[15] Rowling said that his old rival Draco has a grudging gratitude towards Harry for saving his life in the final battle, but the two are not friends.[14]\n\n\n\n## Film appearances[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  | Gabrielle Delacour |  |  | Charlie Weasley |  |  | Fred Weasley |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | Fleur Delacour |  | William \"Bill\" Weasley |  | Percy Weasley |  | Audrey Weasley |  | George Weasley |  | Angelina Johnson |  | Hermione Jean Granger |  | Ronald Bilius \"Ron\" Weasley |  | Ginevra Molly \"Ginny\" Weasley |  | Harry James Potter |  | Dudley Dursley |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHarry is an orphan living with his abusive aunt and uncle, Vernon and Petunia Dursley and their bullying son, Dudley. On his eleventh birthday, Harry discovers he is a wizard when Rubeus Hagrid delivers him an acceptance letter to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He learns that his parents, James and Lily Potter, were murdered by a powerful dark wizard, Lord Voldemort. Harry, instead, survived Voldemort's killing curse, which ended up bouncing back and apparently killing Voldemort, leaving a lightning bolt shaped scar on his forehead. Thus Harry became famous in the wizarding world.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the novels, Harry is the only child of James and Lily Potter, orphaned as an infant. Rowling made Harry an orphan from the early drafts of her first book. She felt an orphan would be the most interesting character to write about.[3] However, after her mother's death, Rowling wrote Harry as a child longing to see his dead parents again, incorporating her own anguish into him. Harry is categorised as a \"half-blood\" wizard in the series, because although both his parents were magical, Lily was \"Muggle-born\", and James was a pure-blood.\n\n\nHarry's aunt and uncle kept the truth about his parents' deaths from Harry, telling him that they had died in a car crash.[2] James Potter is a descendant of Ignotus Peverell, the third of the three original owners of the Deathly Hallows, and thus so is Harry, a realisation he makes during the course of the final book. The lineage continues at the end of the saga through his three children with Ginny: James Sirius Potter, Albus Severus Potter and Lily Luna Potter.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAccording to Rowling, the idea for both the Harry Potter books and its eponymous character came while waiting for a delayed train from Manchester, England to London in 1990. She stated that the idea of \"this scrawny, black-haired, bespectacled boy who didn't know he was a wizard became more and more real to me\".[2] While developing the ideas for her book, she also decided to make Harry an orphan who attended a boarding school called Hogwarts. She explained in a 1999 interview with *The Guardian*: \"Harry had to be an orphan\u2014so that he's a free agent, with no fear of letting down his parents, disappointing them\u00a0... Hogwarts has to be a boarding school\u2014half the important stuff happens at night! Then there's the security. Having a child of my own reinforces my belief that children above all want security, and that's what Hogwarts offers Harry.\"[3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHagrid takes Harry to Diagon Alley to shop for his school supplies. He gifts Harry an owl that he names Hedwig, while Harry buys his very first wand at Ollivanders. The owner reveals to him that the cores of Harry and Lord Voldemort's wands have feathers from the same phoenix bird, establishing a powerful connection between the two. At the end of the summer, Harry boards the Hogwarts Express, where he befriends Ronald Weasley and meets Hermione Granger, who both him and Ron initially dislike. Upon his arrival at Hogwarts, Harry is sorted into Gryffindor House after begging the Sorting Hat not to put him in Slytherin House. He finds mentors in Transfiguration professor and head of Gryffindor Minerva McGonagall and headmaster Albus Dumbledore, whereas he forms a rivalry with Draco Malfoy, a classmate from an elitist wizarding family, and the condescending Potions master, Severus Snape, Draco's mentor and the head of Slytherin House. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | Victoire Weasley |  | Dominique Weasley |  | Louis Weasley |  |  |  |  |  |  | Fred Weasley, Jr. |  | Roxanne Weasley |  | Rose Granger-Weasley |  | Hugo Granger-Weasley |  | James Sirius Potter |  | Albus Severus Potter |  | Lily Luna Potter |\n|\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | Molly Weasley |  | Lucy Weasley |\n|\n\n |\n| **Notes:**\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** The names \"Thomas\" and \"Mary\" Riddle are taken from the *Harry Potter* film series.\n2. **^** In *Harry Potter and the Cursed Child*, Bellatrix is depicted as having had a secret daughter \u2014 Delphini (Delphi) \"The Augurey\" \u2014 who claims to also be the daughter of Lord Voldemort.\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the sixth book, *Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince*, Harry enters a tumultuous puberty that, Rowling says, is based on her and her younger sister's own difficult teenage years.[11] Rowling also made an intimate statement about Harry's personal life: \"Because of the demands of the adventure that Harry is following, he has had less sexual experience than boys of his age might have had.\"[12] This inexperience with romance was a factor in Harry's failed relationship with Cho. Now his thoughts concern Ginny, and a vital plot point in the last chapter includes Harry ending their budding romance to protect her from Voldemort.\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

His first appearance was in the first book of the series, *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*, as the best friend of Harry Potter and Hermione Granger. He is a member of the Weasley family, a pure blood family that resides in \"The Burrow\" outside Ottery St. Catchpole. Being the only member of the three main characters raised in magical society, he also provides insight into the Wizarding World's magical customs and traditions. Along with Harry and Hermione, he is a member of Gryffindor house and is present for most of the action throughout the series.\n\n\n\n\n## Character development[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n8. **^** \"Online Chat Transcript\".

His middle name, Bilius, is the same as that of a deceased uncle. Ron grew up in the family home, The Burrow, near the village of Ottery St Catchpole in Devon. Ron has six siblings: his five older brothers, Bill, Charlie, Percy, twins Fred and George, and a younger sister, Ginny, each with their own distinct personality trait. Ron is often overshadowed by his siblings' accomplishments, but this is shown to be borne out of a lack of belief in himself, rather than a lack of actual talent or skill. Like his brothers, Percy and Bill he is made a Prefect. Like Fred, George and Ginny, he joins the Quidditch team and eventually grows to be an excellent Keeper.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nRowling first introduces Ron with his family in *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*. Harry is lost at King's Cross railway station, and the Weasleys guide him through the barrier at Platform 9\u00be into the wizarding world. Ron and Harry share a compartment on the Hogwarts Express, and they begin their friendship. Ron is fascinated with the famous Harry, and Harry is fascinated with the ordinary Ron. On the train, they both meet Hermione Granger as well, whom they initially dislike but who later becomes their close friend after they save each other during a dangerous encounter with a mountain troll.[PS\u00a0Ch.6] Ron and Harry share the same classes throughout the series and generally have similar academic successes and disappointments. Ron plays a vital part in the quest to save the Philosopher's Stone. His strategy at Wizard's Chess allows Hermione and Harry to proceed safely through a dangerous, life-sized animated chess game. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the epilogue of *Deathly Hallows*, which is set nineteen years after Voldemort's death, Ron and Hermione have two children: Rose Granger-Weasley, whom they are sending off to her first year at Hogwarts, and a younger son named Hugo.[DH\u00a0Ch.37] Though the epilogue does not explicitly say Ron and Hermione are married,[DH\u00a0Ch.37] news articles and other sources treat it as a fact.[4][5][6] Ron has also passed his Muggle driving test, despite Hermione's apparent belief that he could not do so without Confunding the examiner. (Ron secretly reveals to Harry he actually did Confund the examiner.) He and Harry work for the Ministry of Magic as Aurors, and along with Hermione they have helped to revamp the Ministry; it is far different from the one that existed previously.[7] Before becoming an Auror, Ron joins George at Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes, which becomes a very lucrative business.[8]\n\n\n\n## Characterisation[edit]\n\n\n### Outward appearance[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nRon is known for his humour, loyalty, readiness to defend his friends and his love of food. Rowling in an interview described Ron as very funny but insensitive and immature, saying \"There's a lot of immaturity about Ron, and that's where a lot of the humor comes from.\"[9] As his first exercise with the actors who portray the central trio, Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n, who directed the third film in the series, *Prisoner of Azkaban*, assigned them to write an autobiographical essay about their character, written in the first person, spanning birth to the discovery of the magical world, and including the character's emotional experience. Of Rupert Grint's essay, Cuar\u00f3n recalls, \"Rupert didn't deliver the essay. When I questioned why he didn't do it, he said, 'I'm Ron; Ron wouldn't do it.' So I said, 'Okay, you do understand your character.'\"[10] Commenting on Ron's character development in the final book, Rowling explained that \"Ron is the most immature of the three main characters, but in part seven he grows up. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | Victoire Weasley |  | Dominique Weasley |  | Louis Weasley |  |  |  |  |  |  | Fred Weasley, Jr. |  | Roxanne Weasley |  | Rose Granger-Weasley |  | Hugo Granger-Weasley |  | James Sirius Potter |  | Albus Severus Potter |  | Lily Luna Potter |\n|\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | Molly Weasley |  | Lucy Weasley |\n|\n\n |\n| **Notes:**\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** The names \"Thomas\" and \"Mary\" Riddle are taken from the *Harry Potter* film series.\n2. **^** In *Harry Potter and the Cursed Child*, Bellatrix is depicted as having had a secret daughter \u2014 Delphini (Delphi) \"The Augurey\" \u2014 who claims to also be the daughter of Lord Voldemort.\n |\n\n\n![](image)The Weasley family as shown in *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban*, from left to right: Fred or George, Ron, Charlie, Molly, Arthur, Ginny, Bill, Percy, and George or Fred.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| *Harry Potter*(cast \u00b7 music) | * *The Philosopher's Stone*\n\t+ soundtrack, \"Hedwig's Theme\"\n* *The Chamber of Secrets*\n\t+ soundtrack\n* *The Prisoner of Azkaban*\n\t+ soundtrack\n* *The Goblet of Fire*\n\t+ soundtrack\n* *The Order of the Phoenix*\n\t+ soundtrack\n* *The Half-Blood Prince*\n\t+ soundtrack\n* *The Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 1*\n\t+ production\n\t+ soundtrack\n* *The Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2*\n\t+ production\n\t+ soundtrack\n\t+ accolades\n |\n| *Fantastic Beasts*(cast \u00b7 characters) | * *Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them*\n\t+ soundtrack\n* *The Crimes of Grindelwald*\n\t+ soundtrack\n* *The Secrets of Dumbledore*\n |\n\n |\n| Characters | * Harry Potter\n* Ron Weasley\n* Hermione Granger\n* Lord Voldemort\n* Albus Dumbledore\n* Severus Snape\n* Rubeus Hagrid\n* Minerva McGonagall\n* Draco Malfoy\n* Neville Longbottom\n* Ginny Weasley\n* Fred and George Weasley\n* Sirius Black\n* Remus Lupin\n* Cedric Diggory\n* Bellatrix Lestrange\n* Dolores Umbridge\n* Luna Lovegood\n* Supporting characters\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n23. **^** \"Harry Potter and the Secret Chamberpot of Azerbaijan\". tv.com.

Ron fits many of the stereotypes expected of the sidekick; he is often used as comic relief, is loyal to the hero, and lacks much of the talent Harry possesses, at least, early on, in terms of magical power. However, he proves his bravery and magical ability several times, such as by playing 'real wizard's chess' in the first book, entering into the Forbidden Forest with Harry during the second book despite his arachnophobia, producing a full-corporeal Patronus Charm in the fifth book and even, in the seventh book, getting basilisk fangs from the Chamber of Secrets by mimicking Parseltongue without understanding it.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRowling introduces Ron as \"tall, thin and gangling, with freckles, big hands and feet, and a long nose.\"[PS\u00a0Ch.6] Ron has the trademark red hair of the Weasleys and is indeed one of Harry's tallest schoolmates, even outgrowing some of his older brothers. Rowling states in the novels that Ron has freckles, though Rupert Grint, the actor who plays Ron, has none. Rowling has also stated that Ron has blue eyes.\n\n\n\n### Personality[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn *Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire*, the Weasleys invite Harry and Hermione to the Quidditch World Cup. Ron is in awe of his favourite Quidditch champion, Viktor Krum.[GoF\u00a0Ch.7][GoF\u00a0Ch.8] Ron is even more excited when Krum, still a student at the Durmstrang wizarding school, comes to Hogwarts to take part in the Triwizard Tournament, a magical wizarding tournament opposing the top three magic schools in Europe.[GoF\u00a0Ch.12] However, when Harry, underage, mysteriously becomes the fourth Tournament champion, Ron joins the dissenters who think Harry somehow cheated his way into the tournament and feels let down; according to Hermione, this stems from Ron's latent envy caused by being left out of the spotlight shared by Harry or his brothers. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nInitially, Ron does not support Harry's belief that Draco Malfoy is a Death Eater, a follower of Voldemort, but is later convinced. Before leaving Hogwarts with Dumbledore to recover a Horcrux Harry arranges for Ron, Hermione, and Ginny\u2014together with any of Dumbledore's Army they can summon\u2014to keep a close watch on Malfoy and Snape. Harry also provides them with the remains of his vial of Felix Felicis, to aid them in the effort.[HBP\u00a0Ch.25] Despite the D.A.'s watch, Malfoy provides the Death Eaters entrance into Hogwarts, and a battle ensues. Thanks to Felix Felicis, Ron, Hermione and Ginny are unharmed by the Death Eater's hexes during the battle.[HBP\u00a0Ch.29] Snape kills Dumbledore during the battle when Malfoy proves that he is unable to.[HBP\u00a0Ch.27] During his funeral, Ron comforts a weeping Hermione. Ron and Hermione vow to help Harry find and destroy the Horcruxes and kill Voldemort, even if it means leaving Hogwarts.[HBP\u00a0Ch.30]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe trio are eventually captured by Snatchers, and Bellatrix Lestrange tortures Hermione with the Cruciatus Curse for information. This sends Ron into a panic, and he continually screams and fights with all his effort to save her, despite Harry's instruction that he calm down and think of a better plan. The trio and some other prisoners are rescued by Dobby, but the house-elf is killed by Bellatrix during the escape. Eventually, the trio returns to Hogwarts, hoping to find the last unknown Horcrux shown in Harry's vision. Having lost the Sword of Gryffindor to Griphook the goblin, Ron gets an idea to procure more Basilisk fangs and manages to speak enough Parseltongue to open the Chamber of Secrets, where Hermione destroys the Horcrux in Helga Hufflepuff's cup. He begins to worry about the fate of Hogwarts' elves. Upon hearing this, Hermione drops the basilisk fangs she was carrying and kisses him for the first time. \n</fragment>\n</document>",

Rowling's series of eponymous novels. The majority of the books' plot covers seven years in the life of the orphan Harry, who, on his eleventh birthday, learns he is a wizard. Thus, he attends Hogwarts to practise magic under the guidance of the kindly headmaster Albus Dumbledore and other school professors along with his best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. Harry also discovers that he is already famous throughout the novel's magical community, and that his fate is tied with that of Lord Voldemort \u2013 the internationally feared Dark Wizard and murderer of his parents, James and Lily Potter. The book and film series revolve around Harry's struggle to adapt to the wizarding world and defeat Voldemort.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHer own mother's death on 30 December 1990 inspired Rowling to write Harry as a boy longing for his dead parents, his anguish becoming \"much deeper, much more real\" than in earlier drafts because she related to it herself.[2] In a 2000 interview with *The Guardian*, Rowling also established that the character of Wart in T. H. White's novel *The Once and Future King* is \"Harry's spiritual ancestor\".[4] Finally, she established Harry's birth date as 31 July, the same as her own. However, she maintained that Harry was not directly based on any real-life person: \"he came just out of a part of me\".[5]\n\n\nRowling has also maintained that Harry is a suitable real-life role model for children. \"The advantage of a fictional hero or heroine is that you can know them better than you can know a living hero, many of whom you would never meet\u00a0... if people like Harry and identify with him, I am pleased, because I think he is very likeable.\"[6]\n\n\n\n## Appearances[edit]\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the sixth book, *Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince*, Harry enters a tumultuous puberty that, Rowling says, is based on her and her younger sister's own difficult teenage years.[11] Rowling also made an intimate statement about Harry's personal life: \"Because of the demands of the adventure that Harry is following, he has had less sexual experience than boys of his age might have had.\"[12] This inexperience with romance was a factor in Harry's failed relationship with Cho. Now his thoughts concern Ginny, and a vital plot point in the last chapter includes Harry ending their budding romance to protect her from Voldemort.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Harry Potter |\n| --- |\n| *Harry Potter* character |\n| ![](image)Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter in*Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix*\n |\n| First appearance | *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone* (1997) |\n| Last appearance | *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows* (2007) |\n| Created by | J.

According to Rowling, after Voldemort's defeat, Harry joins the \"reshuffled\" Auror Department under Kingsley Shacklebolt's mentoring, and ends up eventually rising to become Head of said department in 2007.[15] Rowling said that his old rival Draco has a grudging gratitude towards Harry for saving his life in the final battle, but the two are not friends.[14]\n\n\n\n## Film appearances[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n18. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Vineyard, Jennifer. \"Daniel Radcliffe Talks Harry Potter's First Kiss\".

He gifts Harry an owl that he names Hedwig, while Harry buys his very first wand at Ollivanders. The owner reveals to him that the cores of Harry and Lord Voldemort's wands have feathers from the same phoenix bird, establishing a powerful connection between the two. At the end of the summer, Harry boards the Hogwarts Express, where he befriends Ronald Weasley and meets Hermione Granger, who both him and Ron initially dislike. Upon his arrival at Hogwarts, Harry is sorted into Gryffindor House after begging the Sorting Hat not to put him in Slytherin House. He finds mentors in Transfiguration professor and head of Gryffindor Minerva McGonagall and headmaster Albus Dumbledore, whereas he forms a rivalry with Draco Malfoy, a classmate from an elitist wizarding family, and the condescending Potions master, Severus Snape, Draco's mentor and the head of Slytherin House. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| *Harry Potter*(cast \u00b7 music) | * *The Philosopher's Stone*\n\t+ soundtrack, \"Hedwig's Theme\"\n* *The Chamber of Secrets*\n\t+ soundtrack\n* *The Prisoner of Azkaban*\n\t+ soundtrack\n* *The Goblet of Fire*\n\t+ soundtrack\n* *The Order of the Phoenix*\n\t+ soundtrack\n* *The Half-Blood Prince*\n\t+ soundtrack\n* *The Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 1*\n\t+ production\n\t+ soundtrack\n* *The Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2*\n\t+ production\n\t+ soundtrack\n\t+ accolades\n |\n| *Fantastic Beasts*(cast \u00b7 characters) | * *Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them*\n\t+ soundtrack\n* *The Crimes of Grindelwald*\n\t+ soundtrack\n* *The Secrets of Dumbledore*\n |\n\n |\n| Characters | * Harry Potter\n* Ron Weasley\n* Hermione Granger\n* Lord Voldemort\n* Albus Dumbledore\n* Severus Snape\n* Rubeus Hagrid\n* Minerva McGonagall\n* Draco Malfoy\n* Neville Longbottom\n* Ginny Weasley\n* Fred and George Weasley\n* Sirius Black\n* Remus Lupin\n* Cedric Diggory\n* Bellatrix Lestrange\n* Dolores Umbridge\n* Luna Lovegood\n* Supporting characters\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHarry is an orphan living with his abusive aunt and uncle, Vernon and Petunia Dursley and their bullying son, Dudley. On his eleventh birthday, Harry discovers he is a wizard when Rubeus Hagrid delivers him an acceptance letter to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He learns that his parents, James and Lily Potter, were murdered by a powerful dark wizard, Lord Voldemort. Harry, instead, survived Voldemort's killing curse, which ended up bouncing back and apparently killing Voldemort, leaving a lightning bolt shaped scar on his forehead. Thus Harry became famous in the wizarding world.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAccording to Rowling, the idea for both the Harry Potter books and its eponymous character came while waiting for a delayed train from Manchester, England to London in 1990. She stated that the idea of \"this scrawny, black-haired, bespectacled boy who didn't know he was a wizard became more and more real to me\".[2] While developing the ideas for her book, she also decided to make Harry an orphan who attended a boarding school called Hogwarts. She explained in a 1999 interview with *The Guardian*: \"Harry had to be an orphan\u2014so that he's a free agent, with no fear of letting down his parents, disappointing them\u00a0... Hogwarts has to be a boarding school\u2014half the important stuff happens at night! Then there's the security. Having a child of my own reinforces my belief that children above all want security, and that's what Hogwarts offers Harry.\"[3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n41. **^** Petre, Jonathan (20 October 2007). \"J K Rowling: 'Christianity inspired Harry Potter'\".

After Harry and Ron save her from a mountain troll in the girls' restroom, she becomes best friends with them and often uses her quick wit, deft recall, and encyclopaedic knowledge to lend aid in dire situations. Rowling has stated that Hermione resembles herself as a young girl, with her insecurity and fear of failure.[2]\n\n\nThe character has had immense popularity. The version of Hermione portrayed by Emma Watson in all eight *Harry Potter* films from *Philosopher's Stone* in 2001 to *Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2* in 2011 was voted the best female character of all time in a poll conducted amongst Hollywood professionals by *The Hollywood Reporter* in 2016.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## Character development[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHermione later uses Polyjuice Potion to impersonate Bellatrix when the trio steal Hufflepuff's cup (a Horcrux) from Gringotts. She, Harry, and Ron join Dumbledore's Army in the Battle of Hogwarts, during which Hermione destroys Hufflepuff's cup in the Chamber of Secrets with a basilisk fang. Hermione and Ron also share their first kiss during the battle.[29] In the final battle in the Great Hall, Hermione fights Bellatrix with the help of Ginny Weasley and Luna. However, the three of them are unable to defeat Bellatrix and stop fighting her once Molly Weasley orders them to disengage.[30]\n\n\n\n#### Epilogue[edit]\n\n\nIn the epilogue of *Deathly Hallows*, which is set nineteen years after Voldemort's death, Hermione and Ron have two children: Rose Granger-Weasley, whom they are sending off to her first year at Hogwarts, and a younger son named Hugo.[DH\u00a0Ch.37] Though the epilogue does not explicitly say Hermione and Ron are married,[31] news articles and other sources treat it as fact.[32][33][34]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Carey, Brycchan (2003). \"Hermione and the house-elves: the literary and historical contexts of J.

She proves just how much she knows by declaring that she memorized all the textbooks by heart. She constantly annoys her peers with her knowledge, so Harry and Ron initially consider her arrogant, especially after she criticises Ron's incantation of the *Levitation* Charm.[13] They heartily dislike her until they rescue her from a troll, for which she is so thankful that she lies to protect them from punishment, thus winning their friendship.[14] Hermione's knack for logic later enables the trio to solve a puzzle that is essential to retrieving the Philosopher's Stone, and she defeats the constrictive Devil's Snare plant by summoning a jet of \"bluebell flame\".[15][a]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHermione becomes a Gryffindor prefect along with Ron and befriends Luna Lovegood, but their friendship has a rocky start after Hermione chastises the publication of Luna's father: \"*The Quibbler*'s rubbish, everyone knows that.\" She also lambasts housemate Lavender Brown for believing the *Daily Prophet's* allegations of Harry fabricating stories of Voldemort's return. Ron and Hermione spend much of their time bickering, likely due to their growing romantic feelings toward one another, but they show continued loyalty to Harry. One turning point in the series is when Hermione conceives the idea of Harry secretly teaching defensive magic to a small band of students in defiance of the Ministry of Magic's dictum to teach only the subject's basic principles from a textbook, with no hands-on practice. Hermione gets an unexpectedly huge response, and the group becomes the nascent Dumbledore's Army. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHermione is extremely compassionate; and very quick to help others, especially the defenceless, such as Neville Longbottom, first-years, House-Elves, fellow Muggle-borns, half-giants like Hagrid, and werewolves like Lupin. After publication of the last book, J.K. Rowling revealed that Hermione's career in the Ministry was to fight for the rights of the oppressed and disenfranchised (such as House-elves or Muggle-borns). Hermione is also very protective of her friends and values them so much that Rowling has suggested that, if Hermione looked in the Mirror of Erised, she would see Harry, Ron, and herself alive and Voldemort defeated.[52] Hermione also learns to ignore what bullies such as Draco Malfoy say to her, often preventing Harry and Ron from retaliating and thinking of some way to outsmart him. She accepts her status as a Muggle-born, and says in *Deathly Hallows* that she is \"a Mudblood and proud of it\".[53]\n\n\n\n### Magical abilities and skills[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHermione's first name is taken from a character in William Shakespeare's *The Winter's Tale*, though Rowling has said that the two characters have little to nothing in common.[12] Rowling said that she wanted her name to be unusual since if fewer girls had the name, fewer girls would get teased for it and it seemed the sort of name that \"a pair of professional dentists, who liked to prove how clever they were\" would give their daughter.[12] Her original surname was \"Puckle\", but Rowling felt the name \"did not suit her at all\", and so the less frivolous Granger was used.[2]\n\n\n\n## *Harry Potter* books[edit]\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n12. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Hermione Jean Granger's name is more a reflection of her parents than her own personality\". *Insider*. 15 November 2018.

She concocts the Polyjuice Potion needed for the trio to disguise themselves as Draco's housemates to collect information about the Heir of Slytherin who has reopened the Chamber of Secrets. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHermione is horrified by the cruelty that house-elves suffer, and establishes S.P.E.W., the Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare, as an effort to gain basic rights for them. She is Bulgarian Quidditch prodigy Viktor Krum's date at the Yule Ball of the Triwizard Tournament.[21] The proper pronunciation of her name (*Her-my-oh-nee*) is interjected into the plot when she teaches it to Krum; the best he can do is \"Herm-own-ninny,\" but she has no problem with it.[2] She later gets into a heated argument with Ron after he accuses her of \"fraternising with the enemy\" about her friendship with Krum. In the book, Hermione's feelings toward Ron are hinted at when she says that Ron can't see her \"like a girl,\" but Krum could. She supports Harry through the Triwizard Tournament, helping him prepare for each task. At the end of the second task, Krum asks her to come to see him over the summer in Bulgaria, but she politely declines. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n77. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Listfield, Emily (8 July 2007). \"We're all so grown up!\". *Parade*.
