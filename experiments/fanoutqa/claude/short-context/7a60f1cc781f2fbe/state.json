The first two were marketed as the \"AFL\u2013NFL World Championship Game\", but were also casually referred to as \"the Super Bowl game\" during the television broadcast.[3] Super Bowl III in January 1969 was the first such game that carried the \"Super Bowl\" moniker in official marketing; the names \"Super Bowl I\" and \"Super Bowl II\" were retroactively applied to the first two games.[4]\n\n\nA total of 20 franchises, including teams that have relocated to another city or changed their name, have won the Super Bowl.[5] There are four NFL teams that have never appeared in a Super Bowl: the Cleveland Browns, Detroit Lions, Jacksonville Jaguars, and Houston Texans, though both the Browns (1950, 1954, 1955, 1964) and Lions (1935, 1952, 1953, 1957) had won NFL Championship Games prior to the creation of the Super Bowl in the 1966 season. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)The Steelers defeated the Rams in Super Bowl XIV to win an unprecedented four championships in six years.\nSeven franchises have won consecutive Super Bowls, one of which (Pittsburgh) has accomplished it twice:\n\n\n\n* Green Bay Packers (Super Bowls I and II)\n* Miami Dolphins (VII and VIII)\n* Pittsburgh Steelers (twice: IX and X; XIII and XIV)\n* San Francisco 49ers (XXIII and XXIV)\n* Dallas Cowboys (XXVII and XXVIII)\n* Denver Broncos (XXXII and XXXIII)[n 1]\n* New England Patriots (XXXVIII and XXXIX)\n\n\nNo franchise has ever won three Super Bowls in a row.

All three teams with three or more consecutive Super Bowl appearances are in the AFC East division. Including those three, 11 teams have at least two consecutive appearances. The Dallas Cowboys are the only team with three separate streaks (1970\u20131971, 1977\u20131978, and 1992\u20131993). The Green Bay Packers, Pittsburgh Steelers, Denver Broncos,[n 1] and New England Patriots have each had two separate consecutive appearances.

The contest is held in an American city, chosen three to four years beforehand,[1] usually at warm-weather sites or domed stadiums.[2] Since January 1971, the winner of the American Football Conference (AFC) Championship Game has faced the winner of the National Football Conference (NFC) Championship Game in the culmination of the NFL playoffs.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| People | * Champions\n\t+ Pre-Super Bowl NFL champions\n* Head coaches\n* Quarterbacks\n* Officials\n |\n| Awards, trophies, records | * Super Bowl ring\n* Vince Lombardi Trophy\n* Most Valuable Players\n\t+ Pete Rozelle Trophy\n* Records\n |\n| Broadcast and\u200b production | * National anthem\n* Halftime\n* Commercials\n\t+ *USA Today* Ad Meter\n\t+ List\n* Broadcast\n\t+ Network broadcasters\n\t+ Counterprogramming\n\t+ Lead-out programming\n\t+ Television ratings\n |\n\n |\n| * Super Bowl Experience\n* Super Bowl Sunday\n* Curse\n* Super Ball\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nNFL championship games (1933\u2013present)\n |\n| --- |\n| NFL Championship(1933\u20131969)[1] | * 1933\n* 1934\n* 1935\n* 1936\n* 1937\n* 1938\n* 1939\n* 1940\n* 1941\n* 1942\n* 1943\n* 1944\n* 1945\n* 1946\n* 1947\n* 1948\n* 1949\n* 1950\n* 1951\n* 1952\n* 1953\n* 1954\n* 1955\n* 1956\n* 1957\n* 1958\n* 1959\n* 1960\n* 1961\n* 1962\n* 1963\n* 1964\n* 1965\n* 1966\n* 1967\n* 1968\n* 1969\n |\n| * 1921 APFA de facto championship game\n* 1925 NFL Championship controversy\n* 1932 NFL Playoff Game\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nSuper Bowl champions\n |\n| --- |\n| * I: Green Bay Packers\n* II: Green Bay Packers\n* III: New York Jets\n* IV: Kansas City Chiefs\n* V: Baltimore Colts\n* VI: Dallas Cowboys\n* VII: Miami Dolphins\n* VIII: Miami Dolphins\n* IX: Pittsburgh Steelers\n* X: Pittsburgh Steelers\n* XI: Oakland Raiders\n* XII: Dallas Cowboys\n* XIII: Pittsburgh Steelers\n* XIV: Pittsburgh Steelers\n* XV: Oakland Raiders\n* XVI: San Francisco 49ers\n* XVII: Washington Redskins\n* XVIII: Los Angeles Raiders\n* XIX: San Francisco 49ers\n* XX: Chicago Bears\n* XXI: New York Giants\n* XXII: Washington Redskins\n* XXIII: San Francisco 49ers\n* XXIV: San Francisco 49ers\n* XXV: New York Giants\n* XXVI: Washington Redskins\n* XXVII: Dallas Cowboys\n* XXVIII: Dallas Cowboys\n* XXIX: San Francisco 49ers\n* XXX: Dallas Cowboys\n* XXXI: Green Bay Packers\n* XXXII: Denver Broncos\n* XXXIII: Denver Broncos\n* XXXIV: St. Louis Rams\n* XXXV: Baltimore Ravens\n* XXXVI: New England Patriots\n* XXXVII: Tampa Bay Buccaneers\n* XXXVIII: New England Patriots\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* 3 times \u2013 Pittsburgh Steelers (X and XIII) vs. Dallas Cowboys (XXX) *see also Cowboys\u2013Steelers rivalry*\n* 2 times \u2013 Miami Dolphins (VII) vs. Washington Redskins (XVII)\n* 2 times \u2013 San Francisco 49ers (XVI and XXIII) vs. Cincinnati Bengals\n* 2 times \u2013 Dallas Cowboys (XXVII and XXVIII) vs. Buffalo Bills[n 3]\n* 2 times \u2013 New York Giants (XLII and XLVI) vs. New England Patriots *see also Giants\u2013Patriots rivalry*\n* 2 times \u2013 New England Patriots (XXXIX) vs. Philadelphia Eagles (LII)\n* 2 times \u2013 New England Patriots (XXXVI and LIII) vs. St. Louis/Los Angeles Rams[n 4]\n\n\n## Super Bowl records by team[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| NFLn/NFCN teams (29\u201328)\n | AFLa/AFCA teams (28\u201329)\n |\n| Pre-merger (0\u20131) as NFLn team\u00a0: Post-merger (2-1) as AFCA team[n 5] |\n\n\nIn the sortable table below, teams are ordered first by number of wins, followed by the number of appearances, and finally by the total number of points scored by the team throughout all appearances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Green Bay Packers (twice: Super Bowls **I** and **II**;

Based on the search results, here are the top 4 teams with the most Super Bowl victories:\n\n1. New England Patriots (6 wins) - Located in Massachusetts\n2. Pittsburgh Steelers (6 wins) - Located in Pennsylvania\n3. San Francisco 49ers (5 wins) - Located in California\n4. Dallas Cowboys (5 wins) - Located in Texas\n\nThese teams have established themselves as the most successful franchises in Super Bowl history. The New England Patriots and Pittsburgh Steelers are tied for the most Super Bowl victories with 6 each, while the San Francisco 49ers and Dallas Cowboys are tied with 5 victories each.\n\nIt's worth noting that these teams have also appeared in more Super Bowls than their win totals indicate, as they've also lost some of their Super Bowl appearances. However, the question specifically asked about wins, so I've focused on their victories.",
