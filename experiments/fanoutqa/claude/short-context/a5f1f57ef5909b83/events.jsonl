The first two were marketed as the \"AFL–NFL World Championship Game\", but were also casually referred to as \"the Super Bowl game\" during the television broadcast.[3] Super Bowl III in January 1969 was the first such game that carried the \"Super Bowl\" moniker in official marketing; the names \"Super Bowl I\" and \"Super Bowl II\" were retroactively applied to the first two games.[4]\n\n\nA total of 20 franchises, including teams that have relocated to another city or changed their name, have won the Super Bowl.[5] There are four NFL teams that have never appeared in a Super Bowl: the Cleveland Browns, Detroit Lions, Jacksonville Jaguars, and Houston Texans, though both the Browns (1950, 1954, 1955, 1964) and Lions (1935, 1952, 1953, 1957) had won NFL Championship Games prior to the creation of the Super Bowl in the 1966 season. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* The New England Patriots won Super Bowls XLIX, LI, and LIII for three wins in five seasons. They also appeared in and lost Super Bowl LII to the Philadelphia Eagles following the 2017 season, giving them four Super Bowl appearances in five years and putting them one win away from three consecutive Super Bowl titles. Moreover, in the intervening year, were eliminated in the AFC Championship Game by the eventual Super Bowl 50 champion Denver Broncos. In total, then, the Patriots were three wins away from five consecutive Super Bowl appearances.\n* The Pittsburgh Steelers won two consecutive Super Bowls (IX and X); the following season they were eliminated in the AFC Championship Game, two wins short of a three-peat, by the eventual Super Bowl XI champion Oakland Raiders.

In August 2008, ESPN.com ranked the Steelers' fans as the best in the NFL, citing their \"unbelievable\" sellout streak of 299 consecutive games.[10][51] The team gained a large fan base nationally based on its success in the 1970s, but many consider the collapse of the city's steel industry at the end of the 1970s dynasty into the 1980s (and the resulting diaspora) to be a large catalyst for the size of the fan base in other cities.[52] The Steelers have sold out every home game since the 1972 season.[53]\n\n\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers have numerous unofficial fan clubs in many cities throughout the country, that typically meet in bars or taverns on game days. This phenomenon is known to occur for other NFL teams as well, but \"Steeler bars\" are more visible than most, including representative establishments even in cities that field their own NFL teams.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe New England Patriots emerged as a prominent rival in league circles when the Patriots upset the Steelers in the 2001 AFC Championship Game at Heinz Field, though the two teams had met in the postseason twice before; the Patriots defeated the Steelers in 1996 28-3 while the Steelers won 7–6 in 1997; both times, the Patriots fielded players with Pittsburgh-area roots in Ty Law and Curtis Martin. Martin's final game with the Patriots was in the 1997 playoffs before he departed to the rival New York Jets. Following the 2001 AFC title upset, the Patriots defeated the Steelers 30–14 at the start of the 2002 season. Pittsburgh did not exact revenge for the two losses until ending the Patriots' record-setting 21-game winning streak in week 6 of the 2004 NFL season. Later that season, the Steelers lost to the eventual Super Bowl champion Patriots in the AFC Championship game after a 15–1 regular season.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nPittsburgh Steelers\n |\n| --- |\n| * Founded in 1933\n* Formerly the **Pittsburgh Pirates** (1933–1939)\n* Based and headquartered in **Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania**\n |\n| Franchise | * History\n* All-Time Team\n* Seasons\n* Logos and uniforms\n* Coaches\n* Players\n* Starting quarterbacks\n* First-round draft picks\n* Records\n |\n| Stadiums | * Home fields: Forbes Field\n* Pitt Stadium\n* Three Rivers Stadium\n* **Acrisure Stadium**\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn contrast with their status as perennial also-rans in the pre-merger NFL, where they were the oldest team never to have won a league championship, the Steelers of the post-merger (modern) era are among the most successful NFL franchises, especially during their dynasty in the 1970s.[6][7][8] The team is tied with the New England Patriots for the most Super Bowl titles at six, and they have both played in (16 times) and hosted (11 times) more conference championship games than any other team in the NFL.

Eight years later, the Steelers advanced to Super Bowl XL by beating Denver 34–17 in Colorado. In 2011, after appearing in Super Bowl XLV, the Steelers had their campaign to repeat as AFC Champions dashed in Denver after a stunning overtime upset by the Tim Tebow-led Broncos in January 2012, in what would become known as the \"316 game\". The following September the Steelers were defeated in Denver 31–19 in Peyton Manning's debut as Broncos quarterback. The two clubs met twice in 2015, as the Steelers defeated the Broncos in the regular season but fell in the Divisional Round of the AFC playoffs; through the 2021 season, Denver leads the series 20–13–1, including 5–3 in the playoffs. Neither team has beaten the other more than three times in a row.

The Patriots compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the league's American Football Conference (AFC) East division. The Patriots play home games at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts, which is 22 miles (35 km) southwest of Boston. The franchise is owned by Robert Kraft, who purchased the team in 1994.[12][13] As of 2023, the Patriots are the second most valuable sports team in the world and have sold out every home game since 1994.[14][15]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)The Super Bowl banners for the Patriots' first three league championships at Gillette Stadium (pictured in 2007, they have since switched the location of them within the stadium, alongside the addition of three more championship banners).\nThe New England Patriots have won six Super Bowls, the league championship of the NFL. The franchise is tied for the most all-time with the Pittsburgh Steelers. The team repeated as champions between the 2003 and 2004 NFL seasons, the last club to do so among the seven franchises who have accomplished it (Green Bay Packers, Miami Dolphins, Pittsburgh Steelers (twice), San Francisco 49ers, Dallas Cowboys, and the Denver Broncos). Between 2001 and 2004, the Patriots became the second team in NFL history (after the Dallas Cowboys) to win three Super Bowls in four years (2001, 2003, 2004), and are also the last franchise to have achieved it.[140]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n67. **^** Bill Pennington (January 12, 2019). \"Foxboro(ugh!): Where Visiting N.F.L.

Two businessmen had tried and failed to get Dallas a team in the NFL: Lamar Hunt responded by forming the American Football League with a group of owners, which would spur the NFL to expand beyond twelve teams. Oilman Clint Murchison Jr. persisted with his intent to bring a team to Dallas, but George Preston Marshall, owner of the Washington Redskins, had a monopoly in the South (after the addition of Dallas, the South would see three further teams - NFL teams in Atlanta and New Orleans, and an AFL team in Miami - added in the next six years).[14]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe NFC East, composed of the Cowboys, Philadelphia Eagles, the Washington Commanders and New York Giants, is one of the least-changed divisions of the original six formed in the wake of the NFL-AFL merger (its only major changes being the relocation of the Cardinals franchise from St. Louis to Arizona and its subsequent move to the NFC West in the league's 2002 realignment). Three of the four teams have been division rivals since the Cowboys' entry into the NFL.

The APFA changed its name to the National Football League a year later. Financial troubles plagued the team and the franchise was forfeited within the year before Lambeau found new financial backers and regained the franchise the next year. These backers, known as \"The Hungry Five\", formed the Green Bay Football Corporation.[28]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe city of Green Bay had a population of only 107,395 as of the 2020 census,[108] and 600,000 in its television market, significantly less than the average NFL figures. The team, however, has long had an extended fan base throughout Wisconsin and parts of the Midwest, thanks in part to playing one pre-season and three regular-season home games each year in Milwaukee through 1995. It was only when baseball-only Miller Park preempted football there that the Packers' home slate became played entirely in Green Bay.\n\n\nAs of 2021, there have been six stock sales to fund Packer operations over the team's history, beginning with $5,000 being raised through 1,000 shares offered at $5 apiece in 1923.[109] The latest was in November 2021, where they sold almost 200,000 shares.[110]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Packers are the last of the \"small-town teams\" that were common in the NFL during the league's early days of the 1920s and 1930s. Founded in 1919 by Earl \"Curly\" Lambeau and George Whitney Calhoun, the franchise traces its lineage to other semi-professional teams in Green Bay dating back to 1896. Between 1919 and 1920, the Packers competed against other semi-pro clubs from around Wisconsin and the Midwest, before joining the American Professional Football Association (APFA), the forerunner of today's NFL, in 1921. In 1933, the Packers began playing part of their home slate in Milwaukee until changes at Lambeau Field in 1995 made it more lucrative to stay in Green Bay full-time; Milwaukee is still considered a home media market for the team.[17][18][19] Although Green Bay is by far the smallest major league professional sports market in North America,[a][20] *Forbes* ranked the Packers as the world's 27th-most-valuable sports franchise in 2019, with a value of $2.63 billion.[21]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n17. **^** Zanghi, Peter (October 2, 2014). \"The Packers' roots run deep in Milwaukee\". *OnMilwaukee*.

He was given $500 for uniforms and equipment in return for the team being named for its sponsor. An early newspaper article referred to the fledglings as \"the Indians\", but by the time they played their first game \"Packers\" had taken hold.\n\n\nIndian Packing was purchased in 1920 by the Acme Packing Company. Acme continued to support the team, which played its first NFL season with \"ACME PACKERS\" emblazoned on its jerseys.\n\n\n\n### Team colors[edit]\n\n\nLambeau, a Notre Dame alumnus, borrowed its Irish's navy blue and gold team colors, much as George Halas borrowed his Illinois alma mater's for the Chicago Bears. As a result, the early Packers were often referred to as the \"Bays\" or the \"Blues\" (and even occasionally as \"the Big Bay Blues\").\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the 2022 season, the Green Bay Packers struggled, and were eliminated from advancing to the NFL's wild card playoffs when they lost their last regular-season game 20-16 to the Detroit Lions. This was the first time the team missed the playoffs during Matt LaFleur's coaching stint, and the last season with Rodgers. The team finished with an 8-9 record. [104]\n\n\n\n## Community ownership[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Green Bay Packers, Inc.\n\n![](image)The Don Hutson Center\nThe Packers are the only community-owned franchise in North America's four traditional major leagues.[a][14][105][106] Rather than being the property of an individual, partnership, or corporate entity, they are held by stockholders, more than 537,000 in total as of 2022. No one is allowed to hold more than 200,000 shares.[5] It is this broad-based community support and non-profit structure[107] which has kept the team in Green Bay for nearly a century even though it is the smallest market in North American professional sports.[a]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nCitations\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** \"Packers Timeline\". *Packers.com*.
