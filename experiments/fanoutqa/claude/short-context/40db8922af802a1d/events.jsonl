They range from 10 to 30 m (33 to 98 ft) in diameter. Their most notable feature is the presence of T-shaped limestone pillars evenly set within thick interior walls composed of unworked stone. Four such circular structures have been unearthed so far. Geophysical surveys indicate that there are 16 more, enclosing up to eight pillars each, amounting to nearly 200 pillars in all. The slabs were transported from bedrock pits located approximately 100 m (330 ft) from the hilltop, with workers using flint points to cut through the limestone bedrock.[56] The pillars are the oldest known megaliths in the world.[57]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe site was first used at the dawn of the Southwest Asian Neolithic period, which marked the appearance of the oldest permanent human settlements anywhere in the world. Prehistorians link this Neolithic Revolution to the advent of agriculture, but disagree on whether farming caused people to settle down or vice versa. Göbekli Tepe, a monumental complex built on the top of a rocky mountaintop, with no clear evidence of agricultural cultivation produced to date, has played a prominent role in this debate. \n\n\nCurrent excavators interpret Göbekli Tepe as a settlement, based on recent findings such as domestic structures and features, water supply installations, and Neolithic tools associated with domestic use.[8] The site's original excavator Klaus Schmidt had described it as a sanctuary used by groups of nomadic hunter-gatherers from a wide area, with few or no permanent inhabitants.[1]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nMiddle Eastern megaliths\n |\n| --- |\n| Lebanon | * Sands of Beirut\n* Hermel\n* Kouachra\n* Tlail\n* Wadi Boura\n | ![Flint Dolmen in Johfiyeh in Jordan](image)\n |\n| Syria | * Stone circles, lines and tombs near the Monastery of Saint Moses the Abyssinian\n |\n| Saudi Arabia | * Hejaz\n* Tihamah\n |\n| Israel | * Atlit Yam\n* Dan (ancient city)\n |\n| Jordan | * Johfiyeh\n* Amman\n |\n| Turkey | * Göbekli Tepe\n* Karahan Tepe\n |\n| Egypt | * Nabta Playa\n |\n| Iran | * Kharg Island\n |\n| Iraq | * Barda Balka\n |\n| General articles | * Standing stone\n* Dolmen\n* Henge\n* Menhir\n* Stone circle\n* Stone row\n* Concentric stone circle\n* Recumbent stone circle\n* Chambered cairn\n* Harrespil\n* Photographs of stone circles\n* European megaliths\n |\n\n| Authority control databases ![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\n |\n| --- |\n| International | * VIAF\n |\n| National | * Germany\n* Czech Republic\n |\n| Geographic | * Pleiades\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBefore any burials were found, Schmidt speculated that graves could have been located in niches behind the walls of the circular building.[59] In 2017, fragments of human crania with incisions were discovered at the site, interpreted as a manifestation of the widespread Neolithic skull cult.[18] Special preparation of human crania in the form of plastered human skulls is known from the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B period at sites such as 'Ain Mallaha, Tell es-Sultan (also known as Jericho), and Yiftahel.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Other structures[edit]\n\n\nAt the western edge of the hill, a lionlike figure was found. In this area, flint and limestone fragments occur more frequently. It was, therefore, suggested that this could have been some kind of sculpture workshop.[68] It is unclear, on the other hand, how to classify three phallic depictions from the surface of the southern plateau. They are near the quarries of classical times, making their dating difficult.[17]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe assumption that the site was strictly cultic in purpose and not inhabited has been challenged as well by the suggestion that the structures served as large communal houses, \"similar in some ways to the large plank houses of the Northwest Coast of North America with their impressive house posts and totem poles.\"[44] It is not known why every few decades the existing pillars were buried to be replaced by new stones as part of a smaller, concentric ring inside the older one.[97] According to Rémi Hadad, in recent years \"the interpretative enthusiasm that sought to see Göbekli Tepe as a regional ceremonial centre where nomadic populations would periodically converge is giving way to a vision that is more in line with what is known about other large Pre-Pottery Neolithic sites, where ritual and profane functions coexist.\"[98] For example, the discovery of domestic buildings and rainwater harvesting systems has forced a revision of the 'temple' narrative.[1]\n\n\n\n## Research history[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nUnequivocally Neolithic are three T-shaped pillars that had not yet been levered out of the bedrock. The largest of them lies on the northern plateau. It has a length of 7 m (23 ft) and its head has a width of 3 m (10 ft). Its weight may be around 50 tons. The two other unfinished pillars lie on the southern Plateau.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Göbekli Tepe** (Turkish: [ɟœbecˈli teˈpe],[2] 'Potbelly Hill';[3] known as *Girê Mirazan* or *Xirabreşkê* in Kurdish,[4] Armenian: Պորտասար)[5] is a Neolithic archaeological site in the Southeastern Anatolia Region of Turkey. The settlement was inhabited from c. 9500 to at least 8000 BCE,[6] during the Pre-Pottery Neolithic. It is famous for its large circular structures that contain massive stone pillars—the world's oldest known megaliths. Many of these pillars are decorated with anthropomorphic details, clothing, and sculptural reliefs of wild animals, providing archaeologists rare insights into prehistoric religion and the particular iconography of the period. The 15 m (50 ft)-high, 8 ha (20-acre) tell is densely covered with ancient domestic structures[7] and other small buildings, quarries, and stone-cut cisterns from the Neolithic, as well as some traces of activity from later periods.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFew humanoid figures have appeared in the art at Göbekli Tepe. Some of the T-shaped pillars have human arms carved on their lower half, however, suggesting to site excavator Schmidt that they are intended to represent the bodies of stylized humans (or perhaps deities). Loincloths appear on the lower half of a few pillars. The horizontal stone slab on top is thought by Schmidt to symbolize shoulders, which suggests that the figures were left headless.[60] Whether they were intended to serve as surrogate worshippers, symbolize venerated ancestors, or represent supernatural, anthropomorphic beings is not known.\n\n\nSome of the floors in this, the oldest, layer are made of terrazzo (burnt lime); others are bedrock from which pedestals to hold the large pair of central pillars were carved in high relief.[61] Radiocarbon dating places the construction of these early circles around 9000 BCE.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Richter, Tobias; Darabi, Hojjat; Alibaigi, Sajjad; Arranz‐Otaegui, Amaia; Bangsgaard, Pernille; Khosravi, Shokouh; Maher, Lisa; Mortensen, Peder; Pedersen, Patrick; Roe, Joe; Yeomans, Lisa (February 2021). \"The Formation of Early Neolithic Communities in the Central Zagros: an 11,500 year-old communal structure at Asiab\". *Oxford Journal of Archaeology*. **40** (1): 2–22. doi:10.1111/ojoa.12213.

They often are associated with the emergence of the Neolithic,[62] but the T-shaped pillars, the main feature of the older enclosures, also are present here, indicating that the buildings continued to serve the same function in the culture,[63] during the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB). The several adjoining rectangular, doorless, and windowless rooms have floors of polished lime reminiscent of Roman terrazzo floors. Carbon dating has yielded dates between 8800 and 8000 BCE.[64] Several T-pillars up to 1.5 meters tall occupy the center of the rooms. A pair decorated with fierce-looking lions is the rationale for the name \"lion pillar building\" by which their enclosure is known.[65]\n\n\n\n* ![Enclosure B](image)\n\nEnclosure B\n* ![Enclosure C](image)\n\nEnclosure C\n* ![Enclosure F](image)\n\nEnclosure F\n\n\n### Slope slide events[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* DVD-ROM: MediaCultura (Hrsg.): *Vor 12.000 Jahren in Anatolien.

The large circular enclosures were attributed to Layer III, dated to the 10th millennium BCE (PPNA). The smaller rectangular structures and the abandonment of the site were assigned to Layer II in the 9th millennium BCE (early to middle PPNB). Layer I consisted of all post-Neolithic activities up to the modern surface.[9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNo definitive purpose has been determined for the megalithic enclosures; Schmidt had described them as the \"world's first temple[s]\" that were intentionally and ritually backfilled. However, recent stratigraphic studies revealed that they had been filled by slope slide events, and were sometimes repaired and modified thereafter.[9]\n\n\nThe site was first noted in a survey in 1963. Schmidt recognized its significance in 1994 and began excavations there the following year. After his death in 2014, work continued as a joint project of Istanbul University, Şanlıurfa Museum, and the German Archaeological Institute, under the direction of Turkish prehistorian Necmi Karul. Göbekli Tepe was designated an UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2018, recognising its outstanding universal value as \"one of the first manifestations of human-made monumental architecture\".[10] As of 2021[update], less than 5% of the site had been excavated.[11]\n\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nApart from the tell, there is an incised platform with two sockets that could have held pillars and a surrounding flat bench. This platform corresponds to the oldest parts of the tell. Continuing the naming pattern, it is called \"complex E\". Owing to its similarity to the cult-buildings at Nevalı Çori it has also been called \"Temple of the Rock\". Its floor has been carefully hewn out of the bedrock and smoothed, reminiscent of the terrazzo floors of the younger complexes at Göbekli Tepe. Immediately northwest of this area are two cistern-like pits that are believed to be part of complex E. One of these pits has a table-high pin as well as a staircase with five steps.[69]\n\n\n\n### Later structures[edit]\n\n\nThe uppermost layer of the tell is the shallowest but accounts for the longest stretch of time. It consists of loose sediments caused by erosion and the virtually-uninterrupted use of the hill for agricultural purposes since it ceased to operate as a ceremonial center.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTwo taller pillars stand facing one another at the centre of each circle. Whether the circles were provided with a roof is uncertain. Stone benches designed for sitting are found in the interior.[58] Many of the pillars are decorated with abstract, enigmatic pictograms and carved animal reliefs. The pictograms may represent commonly understood sacred symbols, as known from Neolithic cave paintings elsewhere. The reliefs depict mammals such as lions, bulls, boars, foxes, gazelle, and donkeys; snakes and other reptiles; arthropods such as insects and arachnids; and birds, particularly vultures. At the time the edifice was constructed, the surrounding country was likely to have been forested and capable of sustaining this variety of wildlife, before millennia of human settlement and cultivation led to the near–Dust Bowl conditions prevalent today.[59] Vultures also feature prominently in the iconography of Çatalhöyük and Jericho.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* **Phases 6 and 7:** Building activity gradually declined in phases 6 and 7 (late 9th to early 8th millennium BC). The loss of enclosures B and D may have led to the construction of building G and the \"Lion Pillar Building\". In Phase 7 another terrace wall was constructed in a last attempt to stabilize the northern slope.[55]\n\n\n* **Phase 8:** In the final occupation period, small habitation structures were built within the remains of the abandoned Neolithic village.[55]\n\n\n## Architecture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Aerial view of the main excavation area, showing circular enclosures A, B, C and D and a number of rectangular structures.\n### Large enclosures[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_01AbF6eRCtH1Cn6TuqwheVBP","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

After this date, the temple-building culture disappeared.[6][7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSome of these sites were excavated but afterwards reburied, such as the Debdieba site. Others, such as Kordin I and II, were destroyed. The other temples usually consist of only a few scattered megaliths or remains, but some such as Buġibba Temple (which is now in the grounds of a hotel) are in better condition. A few sites, such as Ta' Marżiena, have never been excavated. Tas-Silġ contains few megalithic remains, but many more Bronze Age and later remains since the site was used until at least the ninth century AD.\n\n\nApart from these, cart ruts were found at Misraħ Għar il-Kbir, but these may or may not date from the temple period. A submerged site known as Ġebel ġol-Baħar possibly exists off the coast of Malta, but it is not proven to be a megalithic temple.\n\n\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]\n\n* List of World Heritage Sites in Southern Europe\n* List of oldest known surviving buildings\n* Megalithic architectural elements\n* Neolithic architecture\n* Tombs of Malta\n* Xagħra Stone Circle\n* List of largest monoliths\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe oldest structure is the eleven-metre-long straight wall to the west of the temples' first entrance.[54] The deposit against it contained material from the first known human occupation of the island, the Għar Dalam phase. Among the domestic deposits found in this material, which included charcoal and carbonised grain, there were several fragments of daub, accidentally baked.[55] The charcoal fragments were then radiocarbon dated, and their age analysis stood at 4850 BC.[54]\n\n\n\n### Ħaġar Qim\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Ħaġar Qim\n\n![](image)The forecourt of Ħaġar Qim temple\nĦaġar Qim stands on a ridge some two kilometers away from the villages of Qrendi and Siġġiewi.[56] Its builders used the soft globigerina limestone that caps the ridge to construct the temple.[57] One can clearly see the effects of this choice in the outer southern wall, where the great orthostats are exposed to the sea-winds. Here the temple has suffered from severe weathering and surface flaking over the centuries.[58]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAncient temples of Malta (3600 BC–2500 BC)\n\n\n\nMegalithic Temples of Malta| UNESCO World Heritage Site |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) |\n| Location | Malta |\n| Includes | 1.

Its presence was known for a very long time, and even before any excavations were carried out a largely correct plan of its layout was drawn by Jean-Pierre Houël in the late eighteenth century.[42] In 1827, the site was cleared of debris—the soil and remains being lost without proper examination.[43] The loss resulting from this clearance was partially compensated by the German artist Brochtorff, who painted the site within a year or two from the removal of the debris. This is the only practical record of the clearance.[43]\n\n\nA boundary wall encloses the temples. The southerly one is the elder, and is better preserved.[44] The plan of the temple incorporates five large apses, with traces of the plaster that once covered the irregular wall still clinging between the blocks.[45]\n\n\n\n### Ta' Ħaġrat\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Ta' Ħaġrat Temples\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFurthermore, in some cases, later Bronze Age peoples built their own sites over the Neolithic temples, thus adding an element of confusion to early researchers who did not have modern dating technology. Sir Temi Żammit, an eminent Maltese archaeologist of the late nineteenth century, had dated the Neolithic temples to 2800 BC and the Tarxien Bronze Age culture to 2000 BC.[16] These dates were considered \"considerably too high\" by scholars,[17] who proposed a reduction of half a millennium each.[18] However, radiocarbon testing favoured Żammit's dating.[19][20] A theory that the temple art was connected with an Aegean-derived culture collapsed with this proof of the temples' elder origins.[21]\n\n\n\n### Temple phases\n\n[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Węsiory\n |\n| Portugal | * Almendres Cromlech\n* Anta de Adrenunes\n* Anta de Agualva\n* Anta do Alto da Toupeira‎\n* Antas do Barrocal\n* Anta de Carcavelos\n* Anta da Estria\n* Antas da Valeira\n* Anta do Monte Abraão\n* Antas do Olival da Pêga\n* Anta da Pedra dos Mouros\n* Anta das Pedras Grandes\n* Anta da Vidigueira\n* Great Dolmen of Zambujeiro\n* Barreira Megalithic Complex\n* Dolmen of Cunha Baixa\n* Dolmen of Carapito I\n* Great Dolmen of Comenda da Igreja\n* Menhir of Outeiro\n* Menhir of Bulhoa\n* Vale Maria do Meio Cromlech\n* Xerez Cromlech\n |\n| Russia | * Dolmens of North Caucasus\n* Thunder Stone\n* Megaliths in the Urals\n* Russian geoglyph\n |\n| Scandinavia | * Picture stones\n* Runestones\n* Stone circles\n* Stone ships\n |\n| Spain | * Antequera Dolmens Site\n* Chabola de la Hechicera\n* Cova d'en Daina\n* Dolmen de Axeitos\n* Dolmen of Guadalperal\n* Dolmen of Menga\n* Dolmen de la Pastora\n* Dolmen del prado de Lácara\n* Dolmen de Soto\n* Dolmen de Viera\n* La Torre–La Janera\n* Son Matge\n |\n| Turkey | * Obelisk of Theodosius\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* List of multiple-stone circles\n* Aideen's Grave\n* Ardgroom\n* Ardristan standing stones\n* Beltany stone circle\n* Bohonagh\n* Brennanstown Portal Tomb\n* Brownshill dolmen\n* Brú na Bóinne\n* Carraig á Mhaistin stone\n* Carrigagulla\n* Carrowmore\n* Castlenalacht Stone Row\n* Castlestrange Stone\n* Creevykeel Court Tomb\n* Drombeg\n* Gaulstown Portal Tomb\n* Glantane East\n* Grange stone circle\n* High cross\n* Kealkill\n* Knocknakilla\n* Meehambee Dolmen\n* Mount Venus\n* Piper's Stones\n* Poulnabrone dolmen\n* Reask\n* Templebryan Stone Circle\n* Turoe Stone\n* Uragh Stone Circle\n |\n| Jersey | * Jersey dolmens\n* La Hougue Bie\n |\n| Malta | * Megalithic Temples (Borġ l-Imramma\n* Borġ in-Nadur\n* Buġibba\n* Debdieba\n* Ġgantija\n* Ħaġar Qim\n* Ħal Ġinwi\n* Kordin\n* Mnajdra\n* Qortin l-Imdawwar\n* Santa Verna\n* Skorba\n* Ta' Ħaġrat\n* Ta' Marżiena\n* Ta' Raddiena\n* Tal-Qadi\n* Tarxien\n* Tas-Silġ\n* Xemxija\n* Xrobb l-Għaġin)\n* Ħal Saflieni Hypogeum\n* Xagħra Stone Circle\n |\n| Netherlands | * Hunebed\n |\n| Poland | * Brąchnówko\n* Grzybnica\n* Odry\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nEuropean megaliths\n |\n| --- |\n| Armenia | * Metsamor\n* Zorats Karer\n |\n| Azerbaijan | * Gobustan Rocks\n |\n| Bulgaria | * Beglik Tash\n* Garlo\n* Tatul Sanctuary\n |\n| France | * Barnenez\n* Tumulus of Bougon\n* Caixa de Rotllan\n* Carnac\n* Menhir de Champ-Dolent\n* Dolmen de Bagneux\n* Broken Menhir of Er Grah\n* Dolmen de Mané-Kerioned\n* Filitosa\n* Gallardet Dolmen\n* Gavrinis\n* Harrespil\n* Hotié de Viviane\n* Kerzérho\n* Locmariaquer megaliths\n* Mane Braz\n* Paddaghju\n* Peyre-Brune\n* Tombeau de Merlin\n* Tremeca\n* Verziau of Gargantua\n |\n| Germany | * Altendorf\n* Denghoog\n* Fraubillen cross\n* Harhoog\n* Lancken-Granitz dolmens\n* Lohra\n* Megaliths in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern\n* Niedertiefenbach\n* Oldendorfer Totenstatt\n* Riesenstein\n* Route of Megalithic Culture\n* Sieben Steinhäuser\n* Wotanstein\n* Züschen\n |\n| Guernsey | * Castel Menhir\n* Le Creux ès Faïes\n* Déhus Dolmen\n* Les Fouillages\n* La Gran'mère du Chimquière\n* Le Trépied\n* La Varde\n |\n| Ireland | * List of five-stone circles\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* \"Ħal-Saflieni Hypogeum (1982) Malta\". *Ann Mette Heindorff*.

There is evidence of human activity in the islands since the Early Neolithic Period (c. 5000 BC), attested by pottery shards, evidence of fires, and bones.[14][15] The dating and understanding of the various phases of activity in the temples is not easy. The main problem found is that the sites themselves are evolutionary in nature, in that each successive temple brought with it further refinement to architectural development.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n12. **^** De Soldanis, *Gozo, Ancient and Modern, Religious and Profane, Book I*, pp. 86–88\n13. **^** Aquilina, *Maltese- English Dictionary*, p. 776\n14. **^** Żammit, Mayrhofer, *The Prehistoric Temples of Malta and Gozo*, p. 5\n15. **^** \"Maltese Temples\".

What remains are the stone paving of the entrance passage, with its perforations, the *torba* floors,[50] and a large upright slab of coralline limestone.[51] The north wall is in better shape; originally the entrance opened on a court, but the doorway was later closed off in the Tarxien phase, with altars set in the corners formed by the closure.[52] East of this temple, a second monument was added in the Tarxien phase, with four apses and a central niche.[53] Before the temples were built, the area had supported a village over a period of roughly twelve centuries.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe external walls were usually built of coralline limestone, which is harder than the globigerina limestone used in the internal sections of the temples.[33][36] The softer globigerina was used for decorative elements within the temples, usually carvings. These features are usually sculpted in relief, and they show a variety of designs linked to vegetative or animal symbolism.[37] These usually depict running spiral motifs, trees and plants as well as a selection of animals.[38] Although in their present form the temples are unroofed, a series of unproven theories regarding possible ceiling and roof structures have been debated for several years.[39][40][41]\n\n\n\n## UNESCO sites\n\n[edit]\n\n### Ġgantija\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Ġgantija\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe development of the chronological phases, based on recalibrated radiocarbon dating, has split the period up to the Bronze Age in Malta into a number of phases. The first evidence of human habitation in the Neolithic occurred in the Għar Dalam phase, in c. 5000 BC. The Temple period, from c. 4100 BC to roughly 2500 BC, produced the most notable monumental remains. This period is split into five phases;[*citation needed*][22] however, the first two of these left mostly pottery shards. The next three phases, starting from the Ġgantija phase, begins in c. 3600 BC, and the last, the Tarxien phase, ends in c. 2500 BC.\n\n\n\n#### Ġgantija phase (3600–3200 BC)\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Loanhead of Daviot\n* Lochmaben Stone\n* Pictish\n* Ring of Brodgar\n* Sheldon\n* Stenness\n* Steinacleit\n* Strichen\n* Sunhoney\n* Tomnaverie\n* Tyrebagger\n* Yonder Bognie\n |\n| Wales | * Barclodiad y Gawres\n* Bedd Arthur\n* Bedd Taliesin\n* Bodowyr\n* Bryn Cader Faner\n* Bryn Celli Ddu\n* Bryn Gwyn stones\n* Capel Garmon\n* Carreg Coetan Arthur\n* Carreg Samson\n* Coetan Arthur\n* Foel Chwern\n* Llanfechell\n* Lligwy Burial Chamber\n* Maen Llia\n* Maen Madoc\n* Meini Hirion\n* Moel Tŷ Uchaf\n* Parc Cwm long cairn\n* Penrhos Feilw\n* Pentre Ifan\n* St Lythans burial chamber\n* Trefignath\n* Tinkinswood\n* Tŷ Newydd Burial Chamber\n* Whetstones\n |\n| Isle of Man | * Manx runestones\n |\n\n |\n| General | * Axial stone circle\n* Chambered cairn\n* Concentric stone circle\n* Dolmen\n* Henge\n* Harrespil\n* Menhir\n* Standing stone\n* Stone circle\n* Stone row\n* Recumbent stone circle\n* Photographs of stone circles\n* Middle Eastern megaliths\n |\n\n36°02′50″N 14°16′09″E﻿ / ﻿36.04722°N 14.26917°E﻿ / 36.04722; 14.26917\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n78. **^** \"L-Imramma Temple [it-Torri] Ancient Temple : The Megalithic Portal and Megalith Map\".

It details the history of the large circular enclosures, including events that led to their alteration or abandonment, and the evolution of the domestic buildings surrounding them.[54]\n\n\n\n* **Phase 1**: The earliest settlement phase includes the first versions of enclosures A to D and round-oval domestic structures, which indicate a (semi) sedentary lifestyle.[53]\n\n\n* **Phase 2:** In the second phase (early 9th millennium BC) significant modifications of enclosures A-D were undertaken: New walls were erected, which incorporated the first monolithic T-shaped pillars. An increasing number of domestic structures were built, still mostly oval-round, though with a rising tendency for a rectangular floor plan.[53]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRadiocarbon dating shows that the earliest exposed structures at Göbekli Tepe were built between 9500 and 9000 BCE, towards the end of the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A (PPNA) period.[9][25] The site was significantly expanded in the early 9th millennium BCE and remained in use until around 8000 BCE, or perhaps slightly later (the early Pre-Pottery Neolithic B, PPNB).[25] There is evidence that smaller groups returned to live amongst the ruins after the Neolithic structures were abandoned.[25]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Protective roof added to the site\nGöbekli Tepe was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2018, recognising its outstanding universal value as \"one of the first manifestations of human-made monumental architecture\".[10] As of 2021[update], less than 5% of the site had been excavated.[11]\n\n\nConservation work at the site caused controversy in 2018, when Çiğdem Köksal Schmidt, an archaeologist, and widow of Klaus Schmidt, said that damage was caused by the use of concrete and \"heavy equipment\" during the construction of a new walkway. The Ministry of Culture and Tourism responded that no concrete was used and that no damage had occurred.[109]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAt this early stage of the site's history, circular compounds first appear. They range from 10 to 30 m (33 to 98 ft) in diameter. Their most notable feature is the presence of T-shaped limestone pillars evenly set within thick interior walls composed of unworked stone. Four such circular structures have been unearthed so far. Geophysical surveys indicate that there are 16 more, enclosing up to eight pillars each, amounting to nearly 200 pillars in all. The slabs were transported from bedrock pits located approximately 100 m (330 ft) from the hilltop, with workers using flint points to cut through the limestone bedrock.[56] The pillars are the oldest known megaliths in the world.[57]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nApart from the tell, there is an incised platform with two sockets that could have held pillars and a surrounding flat bench. This platform corresponds to the oldest parts of the tell. Continuing the naming pattern, it is called \"complex E\". Owing to its similarity to the cult-buildings at Nevalı Çori it has also been called \"Temple of the Rock\". Its floor has been carefully hewn out of the bedrock and smoothed, reminiscent of the terrazzo floors of the younger complexes at Göbekli Tepe. Immediately northwest of this area are two cistern-like pits that are believed to be part of complex E. One of these pits has a table-high pin as well as a staircase with five steps.[69]\n\n\n\n### Later structures[edit]\n\n\nThe uppermost layer of the tell is the shallowest but accounts for the longest stretch of time. It consists of loose sediments caused by erosion and the virtually-uninterrupted use of the hill for agricultural purposes since it ceased to operate as a ceremonial center.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nincluding the abandonment of the hypothesis that the fill of the structures was brought from elsewhere, and a recognition that direct dates on plaster are affected by the old wood effect.[51] Together with new radiocarbon dates, this has established the site's absolute chronology as falling in the period 9500 to 8000 BCE – the late PPNA and PPNB.[1][52]\n\n\n\n### Building phases[edit]\n\n\nThe preliminary, now abandoned,[53] stratigraphic model by Klaus Schmidt consisted of three architectural layers. The large circular enclosures were attributed to Layer III, dated to the 10th millennium BCE (PPNA). The smaller rectangular structures and the abandonment of the site were assigned to Layer II in the 9th millennium BCE (early to middle PPNB). Layer I consisted of all post-Neolithic activities up to the modern surface.[9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* **Phases 6 and 7:** Building activity gradually declined in phases 6 and 7 (late 9th to early 8th millennium BC). The loss of enclosures B and D may have led to the construction of building G and the \"Lion Pillar Building\". In Phase 7 another terrace wall was constructed in a last attempt to stabilize the northern slope.[55]\n\n\n* **Phase 8:** In the final occupation period, small habitation structures were built within the remains of the abandoned Neolithic village.[55]\n\n\n## Architecture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Aerial view of the main excavation area, showing circular enclosures A, B, C and D and a number of rectangular structures.\n### Large enclosures[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLater enclosures were rectangular in shape, perhaps to make more efficient use of space compared with circular structures. They often are associated with the emergence of the Neolithic,[62] but the T-shaped pillars, the main feature of the older enclosures, also are present here, indicating that the buildings continued to serve the same function in the culture,[63] during the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB). The several adjoining rectangular, doorless, and windowless rooms have floors of polished lime reminiscent of Roman terrazzo floors. Carbon dating has yielded dates between 8800 and 8000 BCE.[64] Several T-pillars up to 1.5 meters tall occupy the center of the rooms. A pair decorated with fierce-looking lions is the rationale for the name \"lion pillar building\" by which their enclosure is known.[65]\n\n\n\n* ![Enclosure B](image)\n\nEnclosure B\n* ![Enclosure C](image)\n\nEnclosure C\n* ![Enclosure F](image)\n\nEnclosure F\n\n\n### Slope slide events[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nwith techniques used to construct other monuments such as Stonehenge.[44] Experiments at Göbekli Tepe itself have suggested that all the PPNB structures currently exposed could have been built by 12–24 people in less than four months, allowing for time spent quarrying stone and gathering, and preparing food.[76] These labour estimates are thought to be within the capability of a single extended family or village community in the Neolithic.[44] They also match the number of people that could have comfortably been inside one of the buildings at the same time.[77]\n\n\nEnclosures B, C and D were initially planned as a single, hierarchical complex that forms an equilateral triangle, according to Haklay and Gopher.[78]\n\n\n\n## Tools[edit]\n\n\nGöbekli Tepe is littered with flint artifacts, from the ridge-top site to the slopes.[79] The tool assemblage found resembles that of other Northern Levantine Pre-Pottery Neolithic (settlement) sites.[80]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFew humanoid figures have appeared in the art at Göbekli Tepe. Some of the T-shaped pillars have human arms carved on their lower half, however, suggesting to site excavator Schmidt that they are intended to represent the bodies of stylized humans (or perhaps deities). Loincloths appear on the lower half of a few pillars. The horizontal stone slab on top is thought by Schmidt to symbolize shoulders, which suggests that the figures were left headless.[60] Whether they were intended to serve as surrogate worshippers, symbolize venerated ancestors, or represent supernatural, anthropomorphic beings is not known.\n\n\nSome of the floors in this, the oldest, layer are made of terrazzo (burnt lime); others are bedrock from which pedestals to hold the large pair of central pillars were carved in high relief.[61] Radiocarbon dating places the construction of these early circles around 9000 BCE.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* **Phases 3–5:** In the early PPNB, the northern and western slopes saw the erection of rectangular (domestic) structures. They underwent multiple construction phases, for instance, the addition of benches with incorporated T-shaped pillar, and new inner walls resulting in more rectangular rooms. The large enclosures were modified as well. Walls were repaired and new ones added. Benches were placed against the interior sides of phase 2 walls.[54]  \n At the end of the early PPNB, a slope slide inundated the lower lying structures, flushing sediments and domestic rubble (likely including midden and burials) downhill. This caused extensive damage to enclosure D, and led to stabilization works in Phase 5. Building C was reconstructed for the last time, and a terrace wall was placed above it, to prevent future slope-slides. Nonetheless, a second major slope-slide event occurred, which likely resulted in enclosure D being abandoned in the late 9th millennium BC.[54]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nUnequivocally Neolithic are three T-shaped pillars that had not yet been levered out of the bedrock. The largest of them lies on the northern plateau. It has a length of 7 m (23 ft) and its head has a width of 3 m (10 ft). Its weight may be around 50 tons. The two other unfinished pillars lie on the southern Plateau.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| UNESCO World Heritage Site\n |\n| Official name | Göbekli Tepe |\n| Type | Cultural |\n| Criteria | (i), (ii), (iv) |\n| Designated | 2018 (42nd session) |\n| Reference no. | 1572 |\n| Region | Western Asia |\n|  |\n|  |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Richter, Tobias; Darabi, Hojjat; Alibaigi, Sajjad; Arranz‐Otaegui, Amaia; Bangsgaard, Pernille; Khosravi, Shokouh; Maher, Lisa; Mortensen, Peder; Pedersen, Patrick; Roe, Joe; Yeomans, Lisa (February 2021). \"The Formation of Early Neolithic Communities in the Central Zagros: an 11,500 year-old communal structure at Asiab\". *Oxford Journal of Archaeology*. **40** (1): 2–22. doi:10.1111/ojoa.12213.

Prehistorians link this Neolithic Revolution to the advent of agriculture, but disagree on whether farming caused people to settle down or vice versa. Göbekli Tepe, a monumental complex built on the top of a rocky mountaintop, with no clear evidence of agricultural cultivation produced to date, has played a prominent role in this debate. \n\n\nCurrent excavators interpret Göbekli Tepe as a settlement, based on recent findings such as domestic structures and features, water supply installations, and Neolithic tools associated with domestic use.[8] The site's original excavator Klaus Schmidt had described it as a sanctuary used by groups of nomadic hunter-gatherers from a wide area, with few or no permanent inhabitants.[1]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Göbekli Tepe** (Turkish: [ɟœbecˈli teˈpe],[2] 'Potbelly Hill';[3] known as *Girê Mirazan* or *Xirabreşkê* in Kurdish,[4] Armenian: Պորտասար)[5] is a Neolithic archaeological site in the Southeastern Anatolia Region of Turkey. The settlement was inhabited from c. 9500 to at least 8000 BCE,[6] during the Pre-Pottery Neolithic. It is famous for its large circular structures that contain massive stone pillars—the world's oldest known megaliths. Many of these pillars are decorated with anthropomorphic details, clothing, and sculptural reliefs of wild animals, providing archaeologists rare insights into prehistoric religion and the particular iconography of the period. The 15 m (50 ft)-high, 8 ha (20-acre) tell is densely covered with ancient domestic structures[7] and other small buildings, quarries, and stone-cut cisterns from the Neolithic, as well as some traces of activity from later periods.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBefore any burials were found, Schmidt speculated that graves could have been located in niches behind the walls of the circular building.[59] In 2017, fragments of human crania with incisions were discovered at the site, interpreted as a manifestation of the widespread Neolithic skull cult.[18] Special preparation of human crania in the form of plastered human skulls is known from the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B period at sites such as 'Ain Mallaha, Tell es-Sultan (also known as Jericho), and Yiftahel.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Other structures[edit]\n\n\nAt the western edge of the hill, a lionlike figure was found. In this area, flint and limestone fragments occur more frequently. It was, therefore, suggested that this could have been some kind of sculpture workshop.[68] It is unclear, on the other hand, how to classify three phallic depictions from the surface of the southern plateau. They are near the quarries of classical times, making their dating difficult.[17]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe assumption that the site was strictly cultic in purpose and not inhabited has been challenged as well by the suggestion that the structures served as large communal houses, \"similar in some ways to the large plank houses of the Northwest Coast of North America with their impressive house posts and totem poles.\"[44] It is not known why every few decades the existing pillars were buried to be replaced by new stones as part of a smaller, concentric ring inside the older one.[97] According to Rémi Hadad, in recent years \"the interpretative enthusiasm that sought to see Göbekli Tepe as a regional ceremonial centre where nomadic populations would periodically converge is giving way to a vision that is more in line with what is known about other large Pre-Pottery Neolithic sites, where ritual and profane functions coexist.\"[98] For example, the discovery of domestic buildings and rainwater harvesting systems has forced a revision of the 'temple' narrative.[1]\n\n\n\n## Research history[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_015FpFrTsMT3w5Z72gRqCf1K","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

The 6-tier, 4-sided structure is the earliest colossal stone building in Egypt.[4] It was built in the 27th century BC during the Third Dynasty for the burial of Pharaoh Djoser. The pyramid is the central feature of a vast mortuary complex in an enormous courtyard surrounded by ceremonial structures and decoration.

This suggests that the state, and therefore the royal government, had a new level of control of resources, both material and human. Also, from this point on, kings of the Old Kingdom are buried in the North, rather than at Abydos.\n\n\nAlthough the plan of Djoser's pyramid complex is different from later complexes, many elements persist and the step pyramid sets the stage for later pyramids of the 4th, 5th, and 6th Dynasties, including the great pyramids of Giza. Though the Dynastic Egyptians themselves did not credit him as such,[11] most Egyptologists credit Djoser's vizier Imhotep with the design and construction of the complex.[9]\n\n\n\n## Precedents[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe complex is enclosed by a wall 10.5 m (34 ft) high that stretched for over 1.6 km (0.99 mi). This wall was built from a thick core of masonry that was encased with Tura limestone, wholly on the outside but partially on the inside.[43] The external façade of the wall had a bastion at a regular interval of 4.1 m (13 ft) adorned with 1,680 hand-carved niches 9 m (30 ft) tall.[16][44] Fourteen of these bastions were larger than the rest. These hosted false double-doors, while a fifteenth situated in the south-east corner of the east façade held the real entrance.[44][45] The entrance was flanked by two towers leading to a passage past which lay the colonnaded entrance.[44]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| III | * Djoser\n* *Buried*\n* *Layer*\n* *Lepsius I*\n* *Athribis*\n* *Elephantine*\n* *Edfu South*\n* *el-Kula*\n* *Naqada*\n* *Saujet el-Meitin [de]*\n* *Sinki [de]*\n |\n| IV | * *Seila*\n* *Meidum*\n* *Bent*\n* *Red*\n* Khufu\n* Djedefre\n* *Unfinished Northern Pyramid of Zawyet el'Aryan*\n* Khafre\n* Menkaure\n* Khentkaus I\n* *Mastabet el-Fara'un*\n* *G1-a*\n* *G1-b*\n* *G1-c*\n* *G1-d*\n* *G2-a*\n* *G3-a*\n* *G3-b*\n* *G3-c*\n* *Lepsius L*\n |\n| V | * Userkaf\n* Neferhetepes [de]\n* Sahure\n* Neferirkare\n* Khentkaus II\n* Neferefre\n* *Unfinished*\n* Nyuserre\n* *Lepsius XXIV*\n* *Double*\n* *Headless*\n* Djedkare-Isesi\n* Unas\n |\n| VI | * Teti\n* Pepi I\n* Merenre\n* Pepi II\n* Sesheshet\n |\n\n |\n| 1st Intermediate Period(2181–2040 BC) | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| * VIII\n | * Ity\n* Neferkare Neby\n* Ibi\n* Khui\n |\n| X | * Merikare\n |\n\n |\n| Middle Kingdom(2040–1650 BC) | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![Outlines of various pyramids overlaid on top of on another to show relative height](image)Comparison of approximate profiles of the Pyramid of Djoser with some notable pyramidal or near-pyramidal buildings.

The complex covers 15 ha (37 acres) and is about 2.5 times as large as the Old Kingdom town of Hierakonpolis.[9] Several features of the complex differ from those of later Old Kingdom pyramids. The pyramid temple is situated at the north side of the pyramid, whereas in later pyramids it is on the east side. Also, the Djoser complex is built on a north–south axis, whereas later complexes utilize an east–west axis. Furthermore, the Djoser complex has one niched enclosure wall, whereas later pyramids have two enclosure walls with the outside one being smooth and the inside one sometimes niched.[10]\n\n\n\n### Great trench[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n40. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** Miroslav Verner, *The Pyramids* (New York: Grove Press, 1998), 105–139.\n41. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** Gay Robins, *The Art of Ancient Egypt* (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2000), 40–45.\n42. **^** Verner 2001d, pp. 110–111.\n43. **^** Edwards 1993, pp. 50–51.\n44. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** Edwards 1993, p. 51.\n45. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** Verner 2001d, p. 112.\n46. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Spencer 1993, pp. 98–99.\n47. **^** Robins 1997, p. 40.\n48. **^** Siliotti & Hawass 1997, pp. 105–113.\n49. **^** Bard 2015, p. 142, fig. 6.2.\n50. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Verner 2001d, p. 113.\n51. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** Lauer 1999, p. 861.\n52. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Edwards 1993, p. 47.\n53. **^** Bard 2015, p. 143.\n54. **^** Edwards 1993, pp. 47–48.\n55. **^** Edwards 1993, p. 46.\n56. **^** Lauer 1962, p. 111.\n57. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Edwards 1993, p. 48.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Perspective view, plan and elevation images Djoser's Pyramid Complex taken from a 3d model\nDjoser was the first or second king of the 3rd Dynasty (c. 2670–2650 BC) of the Old Kingdom of Egypt (c. 2686 – c. 2125 BC).[1] He is believed to have ruled for 19 years or, if the 19 years were biennial taxation years, 38 years.[8] He reigned long enough to allow the grandiose plan for his pyramid to be realized in his lifetime.[9]\n\n\nDjoser is best known for his innovative tomb, which dominates the Saqqara landscape.[8] In this tomb he is referred to by his Horus name Netjerikhet; Djoser is a name given by New Kingdom visitors thousands of years later. Djoser's step pyramid is astounding in its departure from previous architecture. It sets several important precedents, perhaps the most important of which is its status as the first monumental structure made of stone.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the storerooms along here over 40,000 stone vessels were found, many of which predate Djoser.[9] These would have served Djoser's visceral needs in the afterlife. An extensive network of underground galleries was located to the north, west and south of the central burial chamber and crude horizontal magazines were carved into these.[10]\n\n\n\n### Burial chamber[edit]\n\n\nThe burial chamber was a vault constructed of four courses of well-dressed granite. It had one opening, which was sealed with a 3.5 ton block after the burial.[8] No body was recovered as the tomb had been extensively robbed. Lauer believes that a burial chamber of alabaster existed before the one of granite. He found interesting evidence of limestone blocks with five pointed stars in low relief that were likely on the ceiling, indicating the first occurrence of what would become a tradition.[10] The king sought to associate himself with the eternal North Stars that never set so as to ensure his rebirth and eternity.[41]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nthey built successive inclined accretion layers 2–3 m (6.6–9.8 ft) thick.[16][34] These leaned on each other from opposite ends providing greater stability preventing a collapse.[34] The whole was then cased in fine white limestone with a layer of packing in between.[16] This phase of the pyramid had four steps that rose to a height of 42 m (138 ft; 80 cu).[18] The decision was then made to expand the pyramid north and west from four to six steps (P1') which was then finished with a final layer of limestone casing (P2) that gave the pyramid its final form. On completion the step pyramid had a base length of 109 m (358 ft; 208 cu) by 121 m (397 ft; 231 cu) that rose to a height of 60–62.5 m (197–205 ft; 115–119 cu) and occupied a volume of 330,400 m3 (11,670,000 cu ft).[2][18][35]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_017yhv715qB8yWdku7uBYj6V","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

Three sides were extended and built out to create eight shallow steps rising at an angle of 49°. This would have been an elongated step pyramid if the remaining side had not been left uncovered.

It sets several important precedents, perhaps the most important of which is its status as the first monumental structure made of stone.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Spencer, Alan (1993). *Early Egypt: The Rise of Civilization in the Nile Valley*.

This suggests that the state, and therefore the royal government, had a new level of control of resources, both material and human. Also, from this point on, kings of the Old Kingdom are buried in the North, rather than at Abydos.\n\n\nAlthough the plan of Djoser's pyramid complex is different from later complexes, many elements persist and the step pyramid sets the stage for later pyramids of the 4th, 5th, and 6th Dynasties, including the great pyramids of Giza. Though the Dynastic Egyptians themselves did not credit him as such,[11] most Egyptologists credit Djoser's vizier Imhotep with the design and construction of the complex.[9]\n\n\n\n## Precedents[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe main modern excavator of the Step Pyramid was Jean-Philippe Lauer, a French architect who reconstructed key portions of the complex. The complex covers 15 ha (37 acres) and is about 2.5 times as large as the Old Kingdom town of Hierakonpolis.[9] Several features of the complex differ from those of later Old Kingdom pyramids. The pyramid temple is situated at the north side of the pyramid, whereas in later pyramids it is on the east side. Also, the Djoser complex is built on a north–south axis, whereas later complexes utilize an east–west axis. Furthermore, the Djoser complex has one niched enclosure wall, whereas later pyramids have two enclosure walls with the outside one being smooth and the inside one sometimes niched.[10]\n\n\n\n### Great trench[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBefore the enclosure wall, Djoser's pyramid complex is surrounded by a trench dug into the underlying rock. At 750 m (2,460 ft; 1,430 cu) long and 40 m (130 ft; 76 cu) wide, the trench is the largest structure of this kind in the Memphis necropolis. It is rectangular in shape, oriented on the north–south axis. The trench resembles a 𓉔 (hieroglyph h) which represents the floorplan of a house. It is decorated with niches which are suggested by Nabil Swelim to have hosted the spirits of members of the king's court, there to serve the king in his afterlife. In parts, the trench doubles into two with distinct entries. These make accessing the enclosure wall more difficult, indicating its function as a safe-guard. Miroslav Verner suspects that a single entrance was built at the south-east corner granting access to the area.[42]\n\n\n\n### Enclosure wall[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Relief of Djoser facing the temple of Horus of Behedet (modern Edfu) in a blue faience chamber of the south tomb\nThe south tomb has been likened to the satellite pyramids of later dynasties, and has been proposed to house the ka in the afterlife. Another proposal is that it may have held the canopic jar with the king's organs, but this does not follow later trends where the canopic jar is found in the same place as the body. These proposals stem from the fact that the granite burial vault is much too small to have facilitated an actual burial.[10]\n\n\nThe substructure of the south tomb is entered through a tunnel-like corridor with a staircase that descends about 30 m before opening up into the pink granite burial chamber. The staircase then continues east and leads to a gallery that imitates the blue chambers below the step pyramid.[40]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDjoser's mortuary complex comprises the great trench, enclosure wall, colonnaded entrance, 'T' temple, *Sed* festival complex, north and south pavilions, south tomb and court, western mounds, mortuary temple, and the crowning feature of it all, the step pyramid with its substructure.[12][13] The complex was a landmark achievement for Egyptian architecture.[14] It was the advent of the pyramidal form of the royal tomb and the first instance of the mass use of limestone in construction,[15] replacing mudbrick which had been the staple building material prior.[16] This shift to limestone – a hard, dense material compared to mudbrick – presented novel challenges to the architects, though they kept to earlier tradition, copying architectonic elements and carving them into the stone.[15] For example, the Egyptians hand-carved 1,680 9 m (30 ft; 17 cu)-tall niches out of the limestone enclosure wall.[16] In earlier projects, this element was built with wooden planks, ropes, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Entry hall. Step Pyramid Complex, Saqqara\n![](image)Temples of the festival complex\n## Pyramid complex[edit]\n\n\nDjoser's Step Pyramid complex included several structures pivotal to its function in both life and the afterlife. A pyramid was not simply a grave in ancient Egypt. Its purpose was to facilitate a successful afterlife for the king so that he could be eternally reborn. The symbolism of the step pyramid form, which did not survive beyond the 3rd Dynasty, is unknown, but it has been suggested that it may be a monumental symbol of the crown, especially the royal mortuary cult, since seven small step pyramids (that were not tombs) were built in the provinces.[9] Another well accepted theory is that it facilitated the king's ascension to join the eternal North Star.[38]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe south court is a large court between the south tomb and the pyramid. Within the court are curved stones thought to be territorial markers associated with the Heb-sed festival, an important ritual completed by Egyptian kings (typically after 30 years on the throne) to renew their powers.[9] These would have allowed Djoser to claim control over all of Egypt,[9] while its presence in the funerary complex would allow Djoser to continue to benefit from the ritual in the afterlife.[41] At the southern end of the court was a platform approached by steps. It has been suggested that this was a platform for the double throne. This fits into the theory proposed by Barry Kemp, and generally accepted by many, that suggests the whole step pyramid complex symbolizes the royal palace enclosure and allows the king to eternally perform the rituals associated with kingship.[41] At the very south of the South Court lay the South Tomb.\n\n\n\n### South tomb[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSuch statues are present in the monuments of the Fourth Dynasty, but no trace of them has been uncovered at Djoser's complex.[45][52] The end walls of the alcoves had slits cut into them near the ceiling thus allow light to filter in.[54] Near the beginning of the colonnade, at its eastern end, is a corridor which leads to the *heb-sed* court.[55] Between the twelfth and thirteenth alcove[56] is a 'transverse vestibule' with a passage flanked by eight 5 m (16 ft) tall columns and cross-walls leading to a sanctuary.[50][57] Lauer believes this chamber contained a statue of Djoser on a pedestal that bore his name and Imhotep's titles.[51] The torso and base of this statue were found in the entrance colonnade.[19] The west wall of the entrance colonnade has the form of an open door which leads into the south court.[57]\n\n\n\n* ![Entrance](image)\n\nEntrance\n* ![Entrance colonnade of the step pyramid complex](image)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nEgyptologists are split on the motivations behind the conception of the pyramidal form that the mastaba was converted into.[30] Lauer believed that the alteration was made to have the tomb visible from Memphis.[29][31] The fact of the mastaba's square plan led Rainer Stadelmann, however, to suggest that it was never the intended final form and that it was planned to be a pyramid from the outset.[32] The conversion (P1) encased the mastaba (M3) extending its length by 5.76 m (19 ft; 11 cu) on each axis giving it a base length of 85.5 m (281 ft; 163 cu) by 77 m (253 ft; 147 cu).[18][33] The alteration from mastaba to pyramid came with a shift in construction.[18] The builders used larger and better quality, roughly dressed limestone blocks – but instead of horizontal beds, \n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_019uik5HSh6RvMFH1vQdaCLi","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

The several adjoining rectangular, doorless, and windowless rooms have floors of polished lime reminiscent of Roman terrazzo floors. Carbon dating has yielded dates between 8800 and 8000 BCE.[64] Several T-pillars up to 1.5 meters tall occupy the center of the rooms.

They range from 10 to 30 m (33 to 98 ft) in diameter. Their most notable feature is the presence of T-shaped limestone pillars evenly set within thick interior walls composed of unworked stone. Four such circular structures have been unearthed so far. Geophysical surveys indicate that there are 16 more, enclosing up to eight pillars each, amounting to nearly 200 pillars in all. The slabs were transported from bedrock pits located approximately 100 m (330 ft) from the hilltop, with workers using flint points to cut through the limestone bedrock.[56] The pillars are the oldest known megaliths in the world.[57]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTwo taller pillars stand facing one another at the centre of each circle. Whether the circles were provided with a roof is uncertain. Stone benches designed for sitting are found in the interior.[58] Many of the pillars are decorated with abstract, enigmatic pictograms and carved animal reliefs. The pictograms may represent commonly understood sacred symbols, as known from Neolithic cave paintings elsewhere. The reliefs depict mammals such as lions, bulls, boars, foxes, gazelle, and donkeys; snakes and other reptiles; arthropods such as insects and arachnids; and birds, particularly vultures. At the time the edifice was constructed, the surrounding country was likely to have been forested and capable of sustaining this variety of wildlife, before millennia of human settlement and cultivation led to the near–Dust Bowl conditions prevalent today.[59] Vultures also feature prominently in the iconography of Çatalhöyük and Jericho.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nMiddle Eastern megaliths\n |\n| --- |\n| Lebanon | * Sands of Beirut\n* Hermel\n* Kouachra\n* Tlail\n* Wadi Boura\n | ![Flint Dolmen in Johfiyeh in Jordan](image)\n |\n| Syria | * Stone circles, lines and tombs near the Monastery of Saint Moses the Abyssinian\n |\n| Saudi Arabia | * Hejaz\n* Tihamah\n |\n| Israel | * Atlit Yam\n* Dan (ancient city)\n |\n| Jordan | * Johfiyeh\n* Amman\n |\n| Turkey | * Göbekli Tepe\n* Karahan Tepe\n |\n| Egypt | * Nabta Playa\n |\n| Iran | * Kharg Island\n |\n| Iraq | * Barda Balka\n |\n| General articles | * Standing stone\n* Dolmen\n* Henge\n* Menhir\n* Stone circle\n* Stone row\n* Concentric stone circle\n* Recumbent stone circle\n* Chambered cairn\n* Harrespil\n* Photographs of stone circles\n* European megaliths\n |\n\n| Authority control databases ![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\n |\n| --- |\n| International | * VIAF\n |\n| National | * Germany\n* Czech Republic\n |\n| Geographic | * Pleiades\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Göbekli Tepe** (Turkish: [ɟœbecˈli teˈpe],[2] 'Potbelly Hill';[3] known as *Girê Mirazan* or *Xirabreşkê* in Kurdish,[4] Armenian: Պորտասար)[5] is a Neolithic archaeological site in the Southeastern Anatolia Region of Turkey. The settlement was inhabited from c. 9500 to at least 8000 BCE,[6] during the Pre-Pottery Neolithic. It is famous for its large circular structures that contain massive stone pillars—the world's oldest known megaliths. Many of these pillars are decorated with anthropomorphic details, clothing, and sculptural reliefs of wild animals, providing archaeologists rare insights into prehistoric religion and the particular iconography of the period. The 15 m (50 ft)-high, 8 ha (20-acre) tell is densely covered with ancient domestic structures[7] and other small buildings, quarries, and stone-cut cisterns from the Neolithic, as well as some traces of activity from later periods.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe plateau Göbekli Tepe is situated on has been shaped by erosion and quarrying from the Neolithic onwards. There are four 10-metre-long (33 ft) and 20-centimetre-wide (7.9 in) channels on the southern part of the plateau, interpreted as the remains of an ancient quarry from which rectangular blocks were taken. These are possibly related to a square building in the neighbourhood, of which only the foundation is preserved. Presumably, this is the remains of a Roman watchtower that was part of the *Limes Arabicus*, though this is conjecture.[70] Most structures on the plateau seem to be the result of Neolithic quarrying, with the quarries being used as sources for the huge, monolithic architectural elements. Their profiles were pecked into the rock, with the detached blocks then levered out of the rock bank.[70] Several quarries where round workpieces had been produced were identified. Their status as quarries was confirmed by the find of a 3-by-3 metre piece at the southeastern slope of the plateau. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBefore any burials were found, Schmidt speculated that graves could have been located in niches behind the walls of the circular building.[59] In 2017, fragments of human crania with incisions were discovered at the site, interpreted as a manifestation of the widespread Neolithic skull cult.[18] Special preparation of human crania in the form of plastered human skulls is known from the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B period at sites such as 'Ain Mallaha, Tell es-Sultan (also known as Jericho), and Yiftahel.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Other structures[edit]\n\n\nAt the western edge of the hill, a lionlike figure was found. In this area, flint and limestone fragments occur more frequently. It was, therefore, suggested that this could have been some kind of sculpture workshop.[68] It is unclear, on the other hand, how to classify three phallic depictions from the surface of the southern plateau. They are near the quarries of classical times, making their dating difficult.[17]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Hadad, Rémi (2022). \"In the shadow of monoliths: Göbekli Tepe and the monumental tradition of the Pre-Pottery Levant\".

The large circular enclosures were attributed to Layer III, dated to the 10th millennium BCE (PPNA). The smaller rectangular structures and the abandonment of the site were assigned to Layer II in the 9th millennium BCE (early to middle PPNB). Layer I consisted of all post-Neolithic activities up to the modern surface.[9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* **Phases 6 and 7:** Building activity gradually declined in phases 6 and 7 (late 9th to early 8th millennium BC). The loss of enclosures B and D may have led to the construction of building G and the \"Lion Pillar Building\". In Phase 7 another terrace wall was constructed in a last attempt to stabilize the northern slope.[55]\n\n\n* **Phase 8:** In the final occupation period, small habitation structures were built within the remains of the abandoned Neolithic village.[55]\n\n\n## Architecture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Aerial view of the main excavation area, showing circular enclosures A, B, C and D and a number of rectangular structures.\n### Large enclosures[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nApart from the tell, there is an incised platform with two sockets that could have held pillars and a surrounding flat bench. This platform corresponds to the oldest parts of the tell. Continuing the naming pattern, it is called \"complex E\". Owing to its similarity to the cult-buildings at Nevalı Çori it has also been called \"Temple of the Rock\". Its floor has been carefully hewn out of the bedrock and smoothed, reminiscent of the terrazzo floors of the younger complexes at Göbekli Tepe. Immediately northwest of this area are two cistern-like pits that are believed to be part of complex E. One of these pits has a table-high pin as well as a staircase with five steps.[69]\n\n\n\n### Later structures[edit]\n\n\nThe uppermost layer of the tell is the shallowest but accounts for the longest stretch of time. It consists of loose sediments caused by erosion and the virtually-uninterrupted use of the hill for agricultural purposes since it ceased to operate as a ceremonial center.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNo definitive purpose has been determined for the megalithic enclosures; Schmidt had described them as the \"world's first temple[s]\" that were intentionally and ritually backfilled. However, recent stratigraphic studies revealed that they had been filled by slope slide events, and were sometimes repaired and modified thereafter.[9]\n\n\nThe site was first noted in a survey in 1963. Schmidt recognized its significance in 1994 and began excavations there the following year. After his death in 2014, work continued as a joint project of Istanbul University, Şanlıurfa Museum, and the German Archaeological Institute, under the direction of Turkish prehistorian Necmi Karul. Göbekli Tepe was designated an UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2018, recognising its outstanding universal value as \"one of the first manifestations of human-made monumental architecture\".[10] As of 2021[update], less than 5% of the site had been excavated.[11]\n\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nwith techniques used to construct other monuments such as Stonehenge.[44] Experiments at Göbekli Tepe itself have suggested that all the PPNB structures currently exposed could have been built by 12–24 people in less than four months, allowing for time spent quarrying stone and gathering, and preparing food.[76] These labour estimates are thought to be within the capability of a single extended family or village community in the Neolithic.[44] They also match the number of people that could have comfortably been inside one of the buildings at the same time.[77]\n\n\nEnclosures B, C and D were initially planned as a single, hierarchical complex that forms an equilateral triangle, according to Haklay and Gopher.[78]\n\n\n\n## Tools[edit]\n\n\nGöbekli Tepe is littered with flint artifacts, from the ridge-top site to the slopes.[79] The tool assemblage found resembles that of other Northern Levantine Pre-Pottery Neolithic (settlement) sites.[80]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe assumption that the site was strictly cultic in purpose and not inhabited has been challenged as well by the suggestion that the structures served as large communal houses, \"similar in some ways to the large plank houses of the Northwest Coast of North America with their impressive house posts and totem poles.\"[44] It is not known why every few decades the existing pillars were buried to be replaced by new stones as part of a smaller, concentric ring inside the older one.[97] According to Rémi Hadad, in recent years \"the interpretative enthusiasm that sought to see Göbekli Tepe as a regional ceremonial centre where nomadic populations would periodically converge is giving way to a vision that is more in line with what is known about other large Pre-Pottery Neolithic sites, where ritual and profane functions coexist.\"[98] For example, the discovery of domestic buildings and rainwater harvesting systems has forced a revision of the 'temple' narrative.[1]\n\n\n\n## Research history[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nGöbekli Tepe| * Girê Mirazan\n* Xirabreşkê\n |\n| ![Photograph of the main excavation area of Göbekli Tepe, showing the ruins of several prehistoric structures.](image)View overlooking the main excavation area of Göbekli Tepe\n |\n| ![Göbekli Tepe is located in Turkey](image)![Göbekli Tepe](image)\nShown within Turkey\nShow map of Turkey\n![Göbekli Tepe is located in Near East](image)![Göbekli Tepe](image)\nGöbekli Tepe (Near East)\nShow map of Near East\n |\n| Location | Şanlıurfa Province, Turkey |\n| Region | Southeastern Anatolia |\n| Coordinates | 37°13′25″N 38°55′18″E﻿ / ﻿37.22361°N 38.92167°E﻿ / 37.22361; 38.92167 |\n| Type | Settlement |\n| History |\n| Founded | c. 9500 BCE;[1] 11524 years ago |\n| Abandoned | c. 8000 BCE[1] |\n| Periods | * Pre-Pottery Neolithic A\n* Pre-Pottery Neolithic B\n |\n| Site notes |\n| Discovered | 1963 |\n| Excavation dates | 1995–present |\n| Archaeologists | * Klaus Schmidt\n* Necmi Karul\n* Lee Clare\n |\n| Condition | Well-preserved |\n| Ownership | Turkey |\n| Public access | no |\n|  |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPPN villages consisted mainly of clusters of stone or mud brick houses,[19] but sometimes also substantial monuments and large buildings.[20] These include the tower and walls at Tell es-Sultan (Jericho), as well as large, roughly contemporaneous circular buildings at Göbekli Tepe, Nevalı Çori, Çayönü, Wadi Feynan 16, Jerf el-Ahmar, Tell 'Abr 3, and Tepe Asiab.[26] Archaeologists typically associate these structures with communal activities which, together with the communal effort needed to build them, helped to maintain social interactions in PPN communities as they grew in size.[27]\n\n\nThe T-shaped pillar tradition seen at Göbekli Tepe is unique to the Urfa region, but is found at the majority of PPN sites there.[28] These include Nevalı Çori, Hamzan Tepe,[29] Karahan Tepe,[30] Harbetsuvan Tepesi,[31] Sefer Tepe,[28] and Taslı Tepe.[32] Other stone stelae—without the characteristic T shape—have been documented at contemporary sites further afield, including Çayönü, Qermez Dere, and Gusir Höyük.[33]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Present day landscape around Göbekli TepeGöbekli Tepe is located in the Taş Tepeler ('Stone Hills'), in the foothills of the Taurus Mountains.[12] It overlooks the Harran plain and the headwaters of the Balikh River, a tributary of the Euphrates.[12] The site is a tell (artificial mound) situated on a flat limestone plateau.[13] In the north, the plateau is connected to the neighbouring mountains by a narrow promontory. In all other directions, the ridge descends steeply into slopes and steep cliffs.[14]\n\n\nLike most Pre-Pottery Neolithic (PPN) sites in the Urfa region, Göbekli Tepe was built on a high point on the edge of the mountains, giving it both a wide view over the plain beneath, and good visibility from the plain.[15] This location also gave the builders good access to raw material: the soft limestone bedrock from which the complex was built, and the flint to make the tools to work the limestone.[15]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_015SKVmgFQU1FhH3Prom6bZm","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
