On February 6, 2015, the Leafs set a new franchise record of 11 consecutive games without a win. At the beginning of February, Shanahan gained the approval of MLSE's board of directors to begin a \"scorched earth\" rebuild of the club.[134] Both Dave Nonis and Horachek were relieved of their duties on April 12, just one day after the season concluded. In addition, the Leafs also fired several assistant coaches, including Steve Spott, and Rick St. Croix; as well as individuals from the Leafs' player scouting department.[135][136]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn March 2, 2012, Burke fired Wilson and named Randy Carlyle the new head coach. However, the termination proved to be controversial as Wilson had received a contract extension just two months before being let go.[127] Changes at the ownership level also occurred in August 2012, when the OTPP completed the sale of their shares in MLSE to BCE Inc. and Rogers Communications.[128] On January 9, 2013, Burke was fired as general manager, and replaced by Dave Nonis.[129] In their first full season under the leadership of Carlyle, Toronto managed to secure a playoff berth in the 2012\u201313 season (which was shortened again due to another lock-out) for the first time in eight years. However, the Leafs lost in seven games to eventual 2013 Stanley Cup finalist Boston in the first round.[130] Despite the season's success, it was not repeated during the 2013\u201314 season, as the Leafs failed to make the playoffs.[131]\n\n\n\n### Brendan Shanahan era (2014\u2013present)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Division championships | **6** (1932\u201333, 1933\u201334, 1934\u201335, 1937\u201338, 1999\u20132000, 2020\u201321) |\n| Official website | www.nhl.com/mapleleafs |\n\n\nThe **Toronto Maple Leafs** (officially the **Toronto Maple Leaf Hockey Club** and often referred to as the **Leafs**) are a professional ice hockey team based in Toronto.

They also reached the Stanley Cup Finals in 2015 and in 2022. The team is owned by Jeffrey Vinik, and the general manager is Julien BriseBois.

However, the Lightning did not get off to a great start as hoped, and Melrose was eventually fired by the Lightning with a 5\u20137\u20134 record.

Despite an overmatched roster on paper, and a team that struggled in the first two periods of many games, the Lightning remained competitive in the playoff race until March, when they went 5\u201310\u20131 for the month and fell eight points out of a playoff spot.
