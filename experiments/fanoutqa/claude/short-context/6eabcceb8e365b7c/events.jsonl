(The team was officially renamed the Yomiuri Giants in 1947.)\n\n\n\n### NPB establishment[edit]\n\n\nAfter the 1949 season, the JBL team owners reorganized into the NPB; Daiei Stars owner Masaichi Nagata promoted a two-league system, which became the Pacific League (initially called the **Taiheiyo Baseball Union**) and the Central League.

There are also two secondary-level professional minor leagues, the Eastern League and the Western League, that play shorter schedules for developing players. NPB teams are allowed to have more than one minor league team as long as they are outside of the established minor league system, with the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks and Yomiuri Giants being the only teams taking advantage of this. As of 2023, the Hawks have three minor league teams,[3] the Giants have two, and the other ten teams only have one minor league team each. Teams below the Eastern and Western Leagues play exhibition matches against various teams of collegiate, industrial, Shikoku Island League Plus, and other NPB minor league statuses.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* YouTube (Pacific League TV ENG)\n |\n| Official website | NPB.jp |\n\n\n**Nippon Professional Baseball** (日本野球機構, *Nippon Yakyū Kikō*) or **NPB** is the highest level of baseball in Japan. Locally, it is often called **Puro Yakyū** (プロ野球), meaning *Professional Baseball*. Outside of Japan, it is often referred to as \"Japanese baseball\".\n\n\nThe roots of the league can be traced back to the formation of the \"Greater Japan Tokyo Baseball Club\" (大日本東京野球倶楽部, *Dai-Nippon Tōkyō Yakyū Kurabu*) in Tokyo, founded in 1934, and the original circuit for the sport in the Empire founded two years later, the Japanese Baseball League (JBL), which continued to play even through the final years of World War II. The organization that is today's NPB was formed when the JBL reorganized in 1950, creating two leagues with six teams each in the Central League and the Pacific League with an annual season-ending Japan Series championship play-off series of games starting that year.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBaseball league representing the highest level of professional baseball in Japan\n\n\"NPB\" redirects here.

Entering the 2024 season, the Hanshin Tigers, who defeated the Orix Buffaloes 4-3 in the 2023 Japan Series, are the reigning champions. The Japan Series has been contested 74 times as of 2023, with the Pacific League and the Central League winning 37 each.\n\n\n\n\n## League structure[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nUntil 1993, baseball was the only team sport played professionally in Japan. In that year, the J.League professional football league was founded. The new football league placed teams in prefectural capitals around the country—rather than clustering them in and around Tokyo—and the teams were named after their locations rather than after corporate sponsors, despite many clubs in the J.League still being owned and subsidized by corporate entities.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFour JBL teams formed the basis of the Central League: the Chunichi Dragons, the Hanshin Tigers, the Yomiuri Giants, and the Shochiku Robins (formerly the Taiyō Robins). To fill out the league, four new teams were formed: the Hiroshima Carp, the Kokutetsu Swallows, the Nishi Nippon Pirates, and the Taiyō Whales.\n\n\nFour JBL teams formed the basis of the Pacific League: the Hankyu Braves, the Nankai Hawks, the Daiei Stars, and the Tokyu Flyers. To fill out the league, three new teams were formed: the Kintetsu Pearls, the Mainichi Orions, and the Nishitetsu Clippers.\n\n\nMatsutarō Shōriki, the Giants' owner, acted as NPB's unofficial commissioner and oversaw the first Japan Series, which featured the Mainichi Orions defeating the Shochiku Robins 4 games to 2.\n\n\n\n### Expansion and contraction[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1954 a new Pacific League team was founded, the Takahashi Unions, to increase the number of teams in that division to eight. Although the team was stocked with players from the other Pacific League teams, the Unions struggled from the outset and finished in the second division every season. In 1957, the Unions were merged with the Daiei Stars to form the Daiei Unions (and again bringing the number of Pacific League teams down to seven). The Unions existed for a single season, finishing in last place, 43-1/2 games out of first. In 1958, the Unions merged with the Mainichi Orions to form the Daimai Orions. This enabled the Pacific League to contract from the ungainly seven-team arrangement to six teams.\n\n\nAfter these various franchise developments, by the end of the 1950s Nippon Professional Baseball had contracted from the initial allotment of 15 teams down to the current number of 12.\n\n\n\n### 1960s and 1970s[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nNippon Professional Baseball\n |\n| --- |\n| 2024 season\n |\n| Central League | * Chunichi Dragons\n* Hanshin Tigers\n* Hiroshima Toyo Carp\n* Tokyo Yakult Swallows\n* Yokohama DeNA BayStars\n* Yomiuri Giants\n |\n| Pacific League | * Chiba Lotte Marines\n* Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks\n* Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters\n* Orix Buffaloes\n* Saitama Seibu Lions\n* Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles\n |\n| Schedule | * All-Star Series\n* Interleague play\n* Seasons\n* World Baseball Classic\n |\n| Postseason | * Climax Series\n* Japan Series\n |\n| Awards | * Eiji Sawamura Award\n* Most Valuable Player\n* Comeback Player of the Year\n* Rookie of the Year\n* Japan Series Most Valuable Player Award\n* Best Nine Award\n* Golden Spirit Award\n* Matsutaro Shoriki Award\n* Hall of Fame\n |\n| Miscellaneous | * Commissioner\n* Players\n* Foreign players\n\t+ Americans\n* Rosters\n* Stadiums\n* Comparison with Major League Baseball\n* Minor leagues\n\t+ Western League\n\t+ Eastern League\n* Japanese Baseball League\n |\n| * Professional baseball in Japan\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Locality\n | 1950\n | 1951–1952\n | 1953\n | 1954\n | 1955–1956\n | 1957\n | 1958–1972\n | 1973–1977\n | 1978\n | 1979–1988\n | 1989–2003\n | 2004\n | 2005–2022\n | 2023-present\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Sapporo |  | Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters (PL), 2004–2022\n |\n| Kitahiroshima |  | Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters (PL), 2023–present\n |\n| Sendai |  | Lotte Orions (PL), 1973–1977\n |  | Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles (PL), 2005–present\n |\n| Greater Tokyo | Kokutetsu Swallows / Sankei Atoms / Yakult Swallows (CL), 1950–present\n |\n| Yomiuri Giants (CL), 1950–present\n |\n| Toei Flyers / Nippon-Ham Fighters (PL), 1950–2003\n |\n| Mainichi/Daimai/Tokyo/Lotte Orions (PL), 1950–1972\n |  | Lotte Orions / Chiba Lotte Marines (PL), 1978–present\n |\n|  | Takahashi Unions (PL), 1954–1956\n | Daiei Unions (PL), 1957\n |  | Saitama Seibu Lions (PL), 1979–present\n |\n| Daiei Stars (PL), 1950–1956\n |\n|  | Taiyo Whales / Yokohama BayStars (CL), 1955–present\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Comparison of Major League Baseball and Nippon Professional Baseball\n* High school baseball in Japan\n* Japanese Baseball Hall of Fame\n* List of Japanese baseball players\n* List of Japanese players in Major League Baseball\n* Shikoku Island League Plus (Regional professional league)\n* List of Nippon Professional Baseball mascots\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe first professional baseball team in Japan was founded by media mogul Matsutarō Shōriki in late 1934 and called the Dai Nippon Tokyo Yakyu Kurabu (\"the Great Japan Tokyo Baseball Club\"). After matching up with a team of visiting American All-Stars that included Babe Ruth, Jimmie Foxx, Lou Gehrig, and Charlie Gehringer, the team spent the 1935 season barnstorming in the U.S., winning 93 of 102 games against semi-pro and Pacific Coast League teams. According to historian Joseph Reaves, \"The only minor drawbacks to the team's popularity in the States were their kanji characters and their cumbersome Japanese name. They rectified both by renaming themselves the Tokyo Kyojin ['Tokyo Giants'] and adopting a uniform identical to the New York Giants...\"[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn September 1, 1964, Nankai Hawks' prospect Masanori Murakami became the first Japanese player to play in Major League Baseball[12] when he appeared on the mound for the San Francisco Giants; he returned to Japan in 1966. Disputes over the rights to his contract eventually led to the 1967 United States – Japanese Player Contract Agreement; it would be almost 30 years before another Japanese player played in the Major Leagues.[*further explanation needed*]\n\n\nContinuing their dominance from the JBL, the Yomiuri Giants won nine consecutive Japan Series championships from 1965 to 1973.\n\n\nThe Black Mist Scandal rocked Nippon Professional Baseball between 1969 and 1971. The fallout from a series of game-fixing scandals resulted in several star players receiving long suspensions, salary cuts, or being banned from professional play entirely; the resulting abandonment of baseball by many fans in Japan also led to the sale of the Nishitetsu Lions and the Toei Flyers.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAmerican expatriate players made their mark in NPB in the 1980s, with players like the Lee brothers (Leron Lee and Leon Lee), Greg \"Boomer\" Wells, Randy Bass, and Ralph Bryant playing key roles on their NPB teams.\n\n\n\n### Hideo Nomo and the exodus to MLB[edit]\n\n\nIn 1995, star pitcher Hideo Nomo \"retired\" from the Kintetsu Buffaloes and signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers. Nomo pitched over the span of 14 seasons in the Major Leagues before retiring in 2008. He won the Rookie of the Year Award in 1995. He twice led the league in strikeouts, and also threw two no-hitters (the only Japanese pitcher to throw a no-hitter in Major League Baseball until Hisashi Iwakuma achieved the feat in August 2015). Nomo's MLB success led to more NPB players moving to Major League Baseball,[13] and eventually led to the creation of the \"posting system\" in 1998.[14]\n\n\nSince Nomo's exodus, more than 60 NPB players have played Major League Baseball. Some of the more notable examples include:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe 2020 NPB season was delayed numerous times due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Initially preseason games were set to be played without spectators, but with opening day of March 20 remaining unchanged.[26] With the lifting of states of emergency over major Japanese cities, NPB announced that it would begin its regular season on 19 June behind closed doors. \"Warm-up\" games began 26 May.[27] The shortened 120-game regular season began on 19 June.[28] On 10 July NPB began allowing a limited number of fans to attend games, with plans to further ease restrictions in the near future.[29] On 19 September, attendance was expanded to a maximum of 20,000 fans per game, or 50% of stadium capacity.[30]\n\n\n\n## Expatriate baseball players in Japan[edit]\n\n\nMain article: American expatriate baseball players in Japan\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFormer Prime Minister Shinzō Abe's ruling Liberal Democratic Party has proposed expanding NPB to 16 total teams by adding two expansion franchises in each of the country's top-tier professional baseball leagues. The goal of such a move would be to energize the economies of the regions receiving the new teams. Okinawa, Shizuoka, Shikoku, and Niigata have been identified as regions that could play host to said teams.[25]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNonetheless, expatriate baseball players in Japan have been a feature of the Japanese professional leagues since 1934. Hundreds of foreigners—particularly Americans—have played NPB. Taiwanese nationals Shosei Go and Hiroshi Oshita both starred in the 1940s. American players began to steadily find spots on NPB rosters in the 1960s. American players hold several NPB records, including highest career batting average (Leron Lee, .334), highest single-season batting average (Randy Bass, .389), and the dubious record of most strikeouts in a season by a hitter (Ralph Bryant, 204). Americans rank #3 (Tuffy Rhodes, 55) and #6 (Randy Bass, 54) on the list of most home runs in a season, and #2 in single-season RBI (Bobby Rose, 153).

A third mascot, a harpy eagle named Switch, was unveiled in 2016.[112] The Eagles have also periodically featured an unofficial, mischievous mascot named Mr. Carrasco. The character, based on a black crow, is masked and rides a motorcycle.[113] For Black Eagles Day in 2017, Rakuten added a mascot character called Kurowashi-san. Unlike the other costumed mascots, Kurowashi-san appeared as a normal man with a black eagle on his head.[114]\n\n\n\n## Minor League team\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Golden Eagles farm team plays in the Eastern League.

The club's name changed to the **Nippon-Ham Fighters**, its official name became the Nippon-Ham Baseball Corporation, Osamu Mihara became the team president and Futoshi Nakanishi its manager. After 27 years, the \"Flyers\" nickname was abandoned. The \"Fighters\" nickname was born from a public appeal by the team's management. A female high school student from Okayama prefecture submitted the winning name, giving the reasoning that \"(former Fighters player) Katsuo Osugi has guts, so he's a fighter.\" Ironically, Osugi would be traded to the Yakult Swallows soon after the Fighters were rechristened.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Sapporo Dome in 2004\n![](image)Sapporo dome\nPrior to the 2002 season, the idea of moving the Fighters to Sapporo, the capital of Hokkaidō and Japan's fifth largest city, emerged. The Seibu Lions also had preliminary plans to move to the northern metropolis. Tokyo's Fighters fans voiced their opposition to the proposed relocation (though the franchise never drew as many fans as their co-habitual counterparts, the Giants, while playing in the capital), but it was eventually announced that the team would indeed call the Sapporo Dome its new home beginning in 2004. Aiming to build a grassroots relationship with its future fans, the team decided to change its name to the **Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters**.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters roster* view\n* talk\n* edit\n |\n| --- |\n| **First squad** | **Second squad** |\n| **Pitchers**\n* 13 Tsubasa Nabatame\n* 17 Hiromi Itoh\n* 22 Toshihiro Sugiura\n* 24 Shōma Kanemura\n* 25 Naoki Miyanishi\n* 26 Seigi Tanaka\n* 28 Ryūsei Kawano\n* 45 Drew VerHagen\n* 48 Yukiya Saitoh\n* 57 Kōki Kitayama\n* 94 Ren Fukushima\n* 95 Taisei Yanagawa\n\n**Catchers**\n* 2 Ariel Martínez\n* 10 Yūshi Shimizu\n* 23 Torai Fushimi\n* 30 Yūya Gunji\n* 64 Yua Tamiya\n |  | **Infielders**\n* 4 Daigo Kamikawabata\n* 9 Takuya Nakashima\n* 21 Kōtarō Kiyomiya\n* 38 Kazunari Ishii\n* 43 Tatsuki Mizuno\n* 58 Taiki Narama\n\n**Outfielders**\n* 7 Gō Matsumoto\n* 8 Daiki Asama\n* 37 Taiga Egoshi\n* 50 Ryōta Isobata\n* 53 Shun Mizutani\n* 66 Chūsei Mannami\n* 99 Franmil Reyes\n\n\n**Manager**\n* 1 Tsuyoshi Shinjō\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHitters such as Nigel Wilson, Jerry Brooks, Yukio Tanaka, Atsushi Kataoka, Katsuhiro Nishiura and a young Michihiro Ogasawara formed what became known as the **Big Bang lineup** and subsequently shattered various batting records. They ran away with first place for the first half of the season, but a pitching collapse in the second half caused a fall of historical proportions. The Fighters would ultimately finish in second place to the Seibu Lions.\n\n\n\n### Hokkaido Nippon-Ham era\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFrom 1988 until the move to Hokkaidō, the Fighters played their home games in Tokyo Dome, the stadium that replaced their longtime home Korakuen. After the Dome was finished, the pitching dominance of Yukihiro Nishizaki and Yasumitsu Shibata began to emerge. Keiji Osawa came out of retirement to manage the team for a third time in 1993, only to see his team sink to the bottom of the standings; he gained notoriety for kneeling to the fans at the end of that season, begging for their forgiveness. With the Fighters experiencing more managerial troubles in 1996, then-manager Toshiharu Ueda suddenly took a personal leave during a pennant race with the Orix BlueWave, eventually causing the Fighters to fade over the last month of the season. However, new life was born in Tokyo Dome in 1998. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n1. **^** Jason Coskrey (2008-02-21). \"Power-hitting phenom Nakata thrust into spotlight\". *The Japan Times*.

The team's name became the **Nittaku Home Flyers**. Nishimura, in an attempt to inject life back into the unpopular Pacific League, developed seven different uniforms for his team and experimented in every aspect of the team's operation, but the effort failed to produce results. Believing that the Pacific League's chances of survival were grim, Nishimura was on the verge of partnering with the Lotte Orions, who were eyeing a league reunification. When the deal fell through, Nishimura, tired of the baseball establishment, resigned from his leadership position and abandoned the Flyers.\n\n\n\n### Nippon-Ham era\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n28. **^** \"A Wrestler Threw Out an Opening Pitch and Everything Turned to Chaos\". *Thrillist*.

Yukihiro Nishizaki particularly stood out, recording 15 wins and an ERA under three in each of his first two years (though the Rookie of the Year title eluded him), racking up seven double-digit win seasons over the course of his eleven-year stay with the Fighters and gaining a considerable following from female fans due to his easy-going demeanor. In 1986 shortstop Yukio Tanaka joined the club; he remained with the team for 22 seasons, becoming known as \"Mr. Fighters.\"[1]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn January 8, 2018, the Fighters signed a partnership agreement with the Texas Rangers to exchange scouting info with each other and the Rangers will share advice to the Fighters for their plans to build ES-CON Field Hokkaido. ES-CON Field plans would be similar to the then-under construction Globe Life Field in Arlington. Both ballparks would have mixed use community districts,[4] and similar structure, hence why both ballparks look very similar. Also, this was due to the stadium being designed by HKS Architects, who also designed Globe Life Field.\n\n\nIn October 2021, the Fighters replaced longtime manager Hideki Kuriyama, who went on to become manager of Samurai Japan, with former player Tsuyoshi Shinjo. He is best known for winning his first Japan Series title in his last game before retirement.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAlso in 2005, a previously unknown manager, Shigeru Takada, became the club's first general manager. On April 27, owner Yoshinori Ohkoso died. The Fighters retired the number 100 in his honor, a first in club history (also the first retired number for owners in NPB; in North American Major League Baseball, the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim (Gene Autry, 26) and St. Louis Cardinals (August A. Busch Jr., 85) have retired numbers, and in Minor League Baseball, the Kannapolis Cannon Ballers (Dale Earnhardt Sr., 3) are the most notable team owners with retired numbers). Yukio Tanaka reached a career 1,000 RBI total, and Makoto Kaneko joined the 1,000 hit club in the same year. On September 20 the Lions smashed the Fighters at home, crushing the Fighters’ hopes of making the playoffs for the second year in a row. In the offseason, the Fighters acquired Major League veteran José Macías, and as former number one starter Yusaku Iriki tried his luck in America the club attempted to sign Kazuhisa Ishii, but failed. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOver the four seasons between 1974 and 1977, the Fighters dwelled at the bottom of the Pacific League, but after improving to finishing in third place for three straight years between 1978 and 1980, manager Keiji Osawa finally led the Fighters to their second Pacific League pennant in 1981. With saves leader Yutaka Enatsu and starter Shigekuni Mashiba (who went 15–0 over the season) forming the heart of the pitching staff, the Fighters shined with offensive sluggers Tony Solaita, Junichi Kashiwabara, and Tommy Cruz. The team that year also featured various important players of smaller stature, like Makoto Shimada and Nobuhiro Takashiro. They would go on to play the Yomiuri Giants in the Japan Series, where the Fighters lost in six games.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFounded in 1946, the Fighters called Tokyo home for 58 years, as co-tenants of the Tokyo Dome & Korakuen Stadium with the Central League's Yomiuri Giants near the end of their tenure in the capital city. The franchise has won three Japan Series titles, in 1962, 2006, and, most recently, 2016.\n\n\n\n\n## Team history\n\n[edit]\n\n### Senators and Tokyo eras\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWith the formation of the National Baseball League drawing nearer, in 1948 the not-yet-affiliated Daiei club, which had played a few exhibition games against the Otsuka Athletics, joined with Tokyu to create the **Kyuei Flyers** (\"Kyuei\" being a portmanteau of the two companies' names). However, Daiei decided to purchase a separate team, the Kinsei Stars, and after only one year the Flyers reverted to their former name.\n\n\nDuring the off-season of 1949, the Flyers joined the Pacific League after the former league split. In September 1953, the team completed a new ballpark—Komazawa Stadium—along one of Tokyu's train lines in Setagaya, Tokyo, moving from Bunkyo ward's Korakuen Stadium. The Flyers' wild play on the field eventually earned them the nickname, \"Komazawa's hooligans.\"\n\n\n\n### Toei and Nittaku eras\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAt the time, the franchise shared Korakuen Stadium with the Giants, so scheduling games throughout the season for both teams posed a problem. League schedulers tried to avoid putting the Fighters and the Giants at Korakuen on the same day, but when they both had home games scheduled, league officials made the implicit decision that the Giants would play during the day and the Fighters during the night. One novel aspect of the Fighters was that they attracted armies of grade-school boys to sit in the outfield stands on weekend games under a \"Young Boys’ Fan Club\" promotion, starting the first organized fan club in Japanese professional baseball.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAt first, with the unhappy Seibu Lions suddenly changing their approval vote, Giants owner Tsuneo Watanabe and Seibu owner Yoshiaki Tsutsumi voiced their concerns over the move. They believed that Nippon Ham's choice to move the team would spur a decentralization in Japanese professional baseball, and they threatened that a decrease in the number of teams in the Kantō and Kansai regions should merit a one-league system instead of two. As a matter of fact, the question of reorganizing baseball's league structure eventually became a bigger issue than the sale and renaming of the Kintetsu Buffaloes. The issue eventually settled down, though, and the Fighters' relocation was eventually approved by the league. The response from the people of Hokkaidō was weak, but NPB fans welcomed the move, noting that the Fighters could now be free from the Tokyo Dome's high rent and perpetual second-billing to the Giants. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn January 21, 2022, new manager Tsuyoshi Shinjo unveiled a new logo and uniform for the Fighters. The response from fans was mixed to mostly negative.[5][6] Fans often compared their jerseys to the Toronto Blue Jays due to the font they used.[7]\n\n\nOn March 24, 2022, Shinjo was approved by the NPB to be registered as \"BIGBOSS\" for the 2022 season.[8]\n\n\nOn September 28, 2022, the Fighters played their final game at Sapporo Dome, an 11-3 loss to the Chiba Lotte Marines. After the game, it was announced that Tsuyoshi Shinjo would continue being manager for the 2023 season, but he will not wear \"BIGBOSS\" on his jersey.[9]\n\n\n\n## The Fox Dance\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe 2006 offseason saw the departure of two of Nippon-Ham's best players, both via free agency. First baseman Michihiro Ogasawara was signed to a blockbuster contract with the Yomiuri Giants, and left-handed reliever Hideki Okajima departed to the Boston Red Sox. At the start of the 2007 season, Nippon-Ham had a lot of trouble scoring runs, relying far too much on their pitching, despite the continuing maturation of Yu Darvish, who had back-to-back complete game, 14-strikeout performances early in the season. At one point, Nippon Ham was second-to-last in the Pacific League, but recently has been able to turn it around. With the start of Interleague play, Nippon-Ham began a 14-game winning streak, which ended on June 9 with a 3–2 extra inning loss to the Yakult Swallows, with the bullpen wasting another great performance by Darvish.\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_014rAsy4uVMRXsLmfVvyd4vR","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

A third mascot, a harpy eagle named Switch, was unveiled in 2016.[112] The Eagles have also periodically featured an unofficial, mischievous mascot named Mr. Carrasco. The character, based on a black crow, is masked and rides a motorcycle.[113] For Black Eagles Day in 2017, Rakuten added a mascot character called Kurowashi-san. Unlike the other costumed mascots, Kurowashi-san appeared as a normal man with a black eagle on his head.[114]\n\n\n\n## Minor League team\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Golden Eagles farm team plays in the Eastern League.

A former mascot of the team, Cool-kun, who was a penguin, was Mar-kun's friend and rival. He was retired by the team in 2016.[4] |\n| Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks | Hawk Family\n | The SoftBank Hawks have the most mascots of any NPB team, with 11, 9 of which being part of the Hawk Family. These mascots are Harry Hawk, the main mascot, Honey Hawk, his girlfriend (formerly a huge fan of him when Daiei owned the team) and the namesake of Honeys, the club's cheerleading squad, Herculy Hawk, his longstanding rival, Honky Hawk, his uncle, Helen Hawk, Honkey's wife, Hack, Rick and Hock Hawk, his nephews, and Homer Hawk, his older brother and the former main mascot when the club was owned by Daiei.[5] |\n| Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters | Frep the Fox, Polly Polaris, Brisky the Bear, Cubby the Bear\n | An anthropomorphic Ezo red fox, brown squirrel, and black and brown bear.

They were both introduced in 2011.[7] |\n| Saitama Seibu Lions | Leo and Lina\n | Two anthropomorphic white lions, based on Kimba the White Lion, although series creator Osamu Tezuka said Leo was based on Caesar (or Panja as he is known in Japan).\n |\n| Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles | Clutch, Clutchyna, Switch\n | Clutch and Clutchyna are both anthropomorphic golden eagles, whilst Switch is an anthropomorphic harpy eagle from California.[8] |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Central League** |\n| Team\n | Mascot(s)\n | Description\n |\n| Chunichi Dragons | Doala, Shaolon, Paolon\n | An anthropomorphic blue koala, and 2 dragons.

Both of them were introduced in 2011, when DeNA bought the club.\n |\n| Yomiuri Giants | Giabbits\n | Consisting of 6 rabbits, as the Giants' cap logo would look like a rabbit.
