Nile River (including White Nile-Kagera-Nyabarongo-Mwogo-Rukarara system)\n   - Length: 6,650 km (4,130 miles)\n   \n2. Amazon River (including Ucayali-Tambo-Ene-Mantaro system)\n   - Length: 6,400 km (3,976 miles)\n   \n3. Yangtze River (including Jinsha-Tongtian-Dangqu/Chang Jiang)\n   - Length: 6,300 km (3,917 miles)\n   \n4. Mississippi-Missouri River (including Jefferson-Beaverhead-Red Rock-Hell Roaring)\n   - Length: 6,275 km (3,902 miles)\n   \n5. Yenisei-Angara-Selenga River system\n   - Length: 5,539 km (3,445 miles)\n\nIt's worth noting that there is some debate about whether the Nile or the Amazon is truly the longest river in the world. While the Nile has traditionally been considered longer, some recent studies have suggested the Amazon might be longer, with measurements ranging up to 6,992 km. The difference depends on how the rivers' sources and mouths are defined, and which tributaries and channels are included in the measurements. A 2009 peer-reviewed study in the International Journal of Digital Earth concluded that the Nile is longer, measuring 7,088 km compared to the Amazon's 6,575 km.",

Length and Debate:\n- The Amazon River's length is subject to ongoing debate and different measurements\n- It's generally considered to be at least 6,400 km (4,000 mi) long\n- Length estimates range from 6,275 km to 6,992 km\n- There's a historical debate about whether it or the Nile is longer\n\n2. Geography:\n- Flows through Peru, Colombia, and Brazil\n- Source: Apur\u00edmac River at Mismi Peak in Peru's Arequipa Region\n- Mouth: Atlantic Ocean in Brazil\n- Major cities along the river include Iquitos (Peru), Manaus (Brazil), and Macap\u00e1 (Brazil)\n\n3. Basin and Tributaries:\n- Basin size: approximately 7,000,000 km\u00b2\n- Major tributaries include:\n  - Madeira River (largest tributary by discharge)\n  - Rio Negro (second largest)\n  - Japur\u00e1\n  - Mara\u00f1\u00f3n\n  - Tapaj\u00f3s\n  - Ucayali\n\n4. Discharge:\n- The Amazon has an average discharge of 209,000 cubic meters per second\n- This makes it the largest river by water volume in the world\n\n5. Source Elevation:\n- The source is at an elevation of 5,220 meters (17,130 feet)\n\nThis river system is not only one of the longest in the world but also the largest in terms of water volume and basin size, playing a crucial role in South America's geography and ecology.",

Here are the specific details:\n\nLocation: The source is located in Rwanda, specifically in the Nyungwe Forest Reserve.\n\nExact coordinates: 2\u00b016\u2032055.962\u2033S 29\u00b019\u2032052.470\u2033E\n\nElevation: 7,966 feet (2,428 meters) above sea level\n\nThis location was confirmed by a 2005/2006 expedition using modern navigation equipment. The Rukarara River flows into the Mwogo River, which then joins the Mbirurume River to form the Nyabarongo River. The Nyabarongo eventually becomes part of the Kagera River system, which flows into Lake Victoria and ultimately forms the Nile.\n\nThe source is located in forested country in southern Rwanda, east of the Congo-Nile Divide, and the Kamiranzovu Swamp in the Nyungwe Forest Reserve serves as a natural reservoir for the river.",

The Traditional Source (Tuotuo/Dangqu tributary):\n- Location: At the base of a glacier on the west of Geladandong Mountain in the Tanggula Mountains\n- Coordinates: 33\u00b025\u203244\u2033N 91\u00b010\u203257\u2033E\n- Elevation: 5,342 m (17,526 ft) above sea level\n- This is considered the highest source, though not the longest tributary\n\n2. The True Source (hydrologically longest):\n- Location: Jari Hill at the head of the Dam Qu tributary, southeast of Geladandong\n- Coordinates: 32\u00b036\u203214\u2033N 94\u00b030\u203244\u2033E\n- Elevation: 5,170 m (16,960 ft) above sea level\n- Located in wetlands just southeast of Chadan Township in Zadoi County, Yushu Prefecture, Qinghai\n\nThe Tuotuo headwaters are known in Tibetan as \"Machu\" (\u0f62\u0fa8\u0f0b\u0f46\u0f74\u0f0b), which means \"Red Water.\" While the Jari Hill source was discovered to be the true source (in terms of longest distance from the sea) in the late 20th century, the Geladandong source is still commonly referred to as the source of the Yangtze due to its historical and spiritual significance.",

The Ider River is one of the two main source rivers of the Selenga (along with the Delger m\u00f6r\u00f6n).\n\nThe river system's progression from source to sea is as follows:\n1. Ider River (source in Khangai Mountains)\n2. Selenga River (formed by the confluence of Ider and Delger m\u00f6r\u00f6n at Olon Golyn Bilchir, Mongolia)\n3. Lake Baikal (where the Selenga flows into)\n4. Angara River (flows from Lake Baikal)\n5. Yenisei River\n6.

The varying accuracy and precision also makes it difficult to make length comparisons between different rivers without a degree of uncertainty.\n\n\n\n## List of river systems longer than 1,000 km[edit]\n\n\nFor most rivers, different sources provide conflicting information on the length of a river system.

As a result, the length measurements of many rivers are only approximations (see also coastline paradox). In particular, there seems to exist disagreement as to whether the Nile[3] or the Amazon[4] is the world's longest river. The Nile has traditionally been considered longer, but in 2007 and 2008 some scientists claimed that the Amazon is longer[5][6][7] by measuring the river plus the adjacent Par\u00e1 estuary and the longest connecting tidal canal.[8] A peer-reviewed article published 2009 in the *International Journal of Digital Earth* concludes that the Nile is longer.[9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Rank\n | River\n | Length (km)\n | Length (miles)\n | Drainage area(km2)[*citation needed*] | Average discharge(m3/s)[*citation needed*] | Outflow\n | Countries in the drainage basin [*citation needed*] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1.\n | Nile\u2013White Nile\u2013Kagera\u2013Nyabarongo\u2013Mwogo\u2013Rukarara[n 1] | 6,650[3](7,088)[9] | 4,130[3](4,404)[9] | 3,254,555\n | 2,800\n | Mediterranean | Ethiopia, Eritrea, Sudan, Uganda, Tanzania, Kenya, Rwanda, Burundi, Egypt, Democratic Republic of the Congo, South Sudan |\n| 2.\n | Amazon\u2013Ucayali\u2013Tambo\u2013Ene\u2013Mantaro[n 1] | 6,400[4](6,992)[9] | 3,976[4](4,345)[9] | 7,000,000[4] | 209,000\n | Atlantic Ocean | Brazil, Peru, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Venezuela, Guyana |\n| 3.\n | Yangtze\u2013Jinsha\u2013Tongtian\u2013Dangqu (Chang Jiang) | 6,300(6,418) | 3,917(3,988) | 1,800,000\n | 30,166\n | East China Sea | China |\n| 4.\n | Mississippi\u2013Missouri\u2013Jefferson\u2013Beaverhead\u2013Red Rock\u2013Hell Roaring | 6,275 | 3,902 | 2,980,000\n | 16,792\n | Gulf of Mexico | United States (98.5%), Canada (1.5%)\n |\n| 5.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Scientists debate whether the Amazon or the Nile is the longest river in the world. Traditionally, the Nile is considered longer, but recent information suggests that the Amazon may be longer. Differences in the recorded length of the Amazon mainly depend on whether the course south of the Ilha de Maraj\u00f3 at the Amazon's mouth is to be treated as part of the Amazon, or as part of the separate Tocantins River. New evidence, (dated 16 June 2007) obtained from a high-altitude scientific venture in the Andes, claims that \"the Amazon is longer than the Nile by 100\u00a0km, with its longest headwater being the Carhuasanta stream originating in the south of Peru on the Nevado Mismi mountain's northern slopes and flowing into the R\u00edo Apur\u00edmac\".[29] However, the origin of the river at Nevado Mismi had already been known more than one decade earlier (see Jacek Palkiewicz), and satellite based measuring from this origin to the Amazon mouth has resulted in not more than 6,400\u00a0km.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nReferences\n1. **^** \"Where Does the Amazon River Begin?\". *National Geographic News*. 2014-02-15.

That gives the impression that most of the Congo basin was formerly on a much higher land level and that the Congo River was rejuvenated by much of its lower course being removed, likeliest when Africa split from South America when Gondwanaland broke up due to continental drift, and before that, the Congo would likely have flowed into the Amazon,[30] producing a river around 6000 miles or 10,000\u00a0km long.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | 952\n |  |  | Yangtze | China\n |\n| 91.\n | Kura/Mt'k'vari | 1,515\n | 941\n | 188,400\n | 575\n | Caspian Sea | Turkey, Georgia, Azerbaijan |\n| 92.\n | Oka | 1,500\n | 932\n | 245,000\n | 1,258\n | Volga | Russia\n |\n| 93.\n | Upper Murray | 1,500[22] | 932 |  |  | Lower Murray | Australia\n |\n| 94.\n | Guaviare | 1,497\n | 930\n |  |  | Orinoco | Colombia\n |\n| 95.\n | Pecos | 1,490\n | 926\n |  |  | Rio Grande | United States\n |\n| 96.\n | Murrumbidgee River | 1,485 [15] | 923\n | 84,917\n | 120\n | Murray River | Australia\n |\n| 97.\n | Upper Yenisey\u2013Little Yenisey (Kaa-Hem) | 1,480\n | 920\n |  |  | Yenisey | Russia, Mongolia\n |\n| 98.\n | Godavari | 1,465\n | 910\n | 312,812\n | 3,061\n | Bay of Bengal | India\n |\n| 99.\n | Colorado (Texas)\n | 1,438\n | 894\n |  |  | Gulf of Mexico\n | United States\n |\n| 100.\n | Upper Tocantins | 1,427\n | 887\n |  |  | Tocantins | Brazil\n |\n| 101.\n | Belaya | 1,420\n | 882\n | 142,000\n | 858\n | Kama | Russia\n |\n| 101.\n | Cooper\u2013Barcoo | 1,420\n | 880\n |  |  | Lake Eyre | Australia\n |\n| 103.\n | Mara\u00f1\u00f3n | 1,415\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Lists of rivers\n* List of drainage basins by area\n* List of rivers by discharge\n* List of river films and television series\n\n\n## Notes and references[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |  |  | Mississippi | United States\n |\n| 129.\n | Rhine | 1,233\n | 768\n | 185,000 [27] | 2,330\n | North Sea | Germany (57.3%), Switzerland (15.1%), Netherlands (12.3%), France (12.2%), Luxembourg (1.4%), Austria (1.3%), Belgium (0.4%), Liechtenstein (0.1%), Italy (0.03%)\n |\n| 130.\n | Athabasca | 1,231\n | 765\n | 95,300\n |  | Mackenzie | Canada\n |\n| 131.\n | Canadian | 1,223\n | 760\n |  |  | Arkansas | United States\n |\n| 132.\n | North Saskatchewan | 1,220\n | 758\n |  |  | Saskatchewan | Canada\n |\n| 133.\n | Vistula\u2013Narew-Bug | 1,213\n | 754\n | 194,424\n | 1,080\n | Baltic Sea | Poland, Belarus, Ukraine\n |\n| 134.\n | Vaal | 1,210\n | 752\n |  |  | Orange | South Africa |\n| 135.\n | Shire | 1,200\n | 746\n |  |  | Zambezi | Mozambique, Malawi |\n| 135.\n | Ogoou\u00e9 (or Ogowe) | 1,200\n | 746\n | 223,856\n | 4,706\n | Atlantic Ocean\n | Gabon, Republic of the Congo |\n| 137.\n | Nen (Nonni) | 1,190\n | 739\n |  |  | Songhua | China\n |\n| 138.\n | K\u0131z\u0131l River | 1,182\n | 734\n | 115,000\n | 400\n | Black Sea | Turkey\n |\n| 139.\n | Markha | 1,181\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

While the Nile has traditionally been considered longer, some recent studies have suggested the Amazon might be longer, with measurements ranging up to 6,992 km. The difference depends on how the rivers' sources and mouths are defined, and which tributaries and channels are included in the measurements.

Winter winds blow south, up river, so ships could sail up river using sails and down river using the flow of the river. While most Egyptians still live in the Nile valley, the 1970 completion of the Aswan Dam ended the summer floods and their renewal of the fertile soil, fundamentally changing farming practices. The Nile supports much of the population living along its banks, enabling Egyptians to live in otherwise inhospitable regions of the Sahara. The river's flow is disturbed at several points by the Cataracts of the Nile which form an obstacle to navigation by boats. The Sudd also forms a formidable navigation obstacle and impedes water flow, to the extent that Sudan had once attempted to build the Jonglei Canal to bypass the swamp.[81][82]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe source of the White Nile, even after centuries of exploration, remains in dispute. The most remote source that is indisputably a source for the White Nile is the Kagera River; however, the Kagera has tributaries that are in contention for the farthest source of the White Nile. Two start in Burundi: the Ruvyironza River (also known as the Luvironza) and the Rurubu River.[34][33] In addition, in 2010, an exploration party in Rwanda[35] went to a place described as the source of the Rukarara tributary,[36] and by hacking a path up steep jungle-choked mountain slopes in the Nyungwe Forest found (in the dry season) an appreciable incoming surface flow for many kilometres upstream, and found a new source, giving the Nile a length of 6,758\u00a0km (4,199\u00a0mi).[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### In Uganda[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The Blue Nile Falls fed by Lake Tana near the city of Bahir Dar, Ethiopia\n![](image)Annotated view of the Nile and Red Sea, with a dust storm[43]\nThe Blue Nile (Amharic: \u12d3\u1263\u12ed, *\u02bf\u0100bay*[44][45]) springs from Lake Tana in the Ethiopian Highlands. The Blue Nile flows about 1,400 kilometres to Khartoum, where the Blue Nile and White Nile join to form the Nile.[46] Ninety percent of the water and ninety-six percent of the transported sediment carried by the Nile[47] originates in Ethiopia, with fifty-nine percent of the water from the Blue Nile (the rest being from the Tekez\u00e9, Atbarah, Sobat, and small tributaries). The erosion and transportation of silt only occurs during the Ethiopian rainy season when rainfall is especially high in the Ethiopian Highlands; the rest of the year, the great rivers draining Ethiopia into the Nile have a weaker flow. In harsh and arid seasons and droughts, the Blue Nile dries out completely.[48]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNotes\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** The length of the Nile is usually said to be about 6,650\u00a0km (4,130\u00a0mi),[3] but reported values lie anywhere between 5,499\u00a0km (3,417\u00a0mi) and 7,088\u00a0km (4,404\u00a0mi).[4] The measurements of many rivers' lengths are only approximations and may differ from each other because there are many factors that determine the calculated length of a river, such as the position of the geographical source and the mouth, the scale of measurement, and the technique used to measure length (see also List of rivers by length).[4][8]\n2. **^** Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0646\u064a\u0644, romanized:\u00a0*an-N\u012bl*, Arabic pronunciation: [an'ni\u02d0l], Bohairic Coptic: \u2cab\u2c93\u2c81\u2ca3\u2c9f Coptic pronunciation: [p\u02b0ja\u02c8ro],[1] Luganda: *Kiira* Luganda pronunciation: [ki:ra], Nobiin: \u00c1man Daw\u016b[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe **Nile**[b] is a major north-flowing river in northeastern Africa. It flows into the Mediterranean Sea. The Nile is the longest river in Africa and has historically been considered the longest river in the world,[3][4] though this has been contested by research suggesting that the Amazon River is slightly longer.[5][6] Of the world's major rivers, the Nile is one of the smallest, as measured by annual flow in cubic metres of water.[7] About 6,650\u00a0km (4,130\u00a0mi)[a] long, its drainage basin covers eleven countries: the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Tanzania, Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda, Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, South Sudan, Republic of the Sudan, and Egypt.[9] In particular, the Nile is the primary water source of Egypt, Sudan and South Sudan.[10] Additionally, the Nile is an important economic river, supporting agriculture and fishing.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n60. **^** El Mahmoudi, A.; Gabr, A.

The drainage basin of the Nile covers 3,254,555 square kilometers (1,256,591\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), about 10% of the area of Africa.[28] Compared to other major rivers, though, the Nile carries little water (5% of that of the Congo River, for example).[29] The Nile basin is complex, and because of this, the discharge at any given point along the main stem depends on many factors including weather, diversions, evaporation and evapotranspiration, and groundwater flow.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n81. **^** Shahin, Mamdouh (2002). *Hydrology and Water Resources of Africa*.

In 2009, a peer-reviewed article, was published, concluding that the Nile is longer than the Amazon by stating a length of 7,088\u00a0km (4,404\u00a0mi) for the Nile and 6,575\u00a0km (4,086\u00a0mi) for the Amazon, measured by using a combination of satellite image analysis and field investigations to the source regions.[3]\nAccording to the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, the final length of the Amazon remains open to interpretation and continued debate.[2][20]\n\n\n\n## Watershed[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Amazon basin\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Amazon River*Rio Amazonas*\n |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)Amazon River\n |\n| ![](image)Amazon River and its drainage basin\n |\n| Native name | *Amazonas*\u00a0(Portuguese) |\n| Location |\n| Country | Peru, Colombia, Brazil |\n| Cities | Iquitos (Peru); Leticia (Colombia); Tabatinga (Brazil); Tef\u00e9 (Brazil); Itacoatiara (Brazil) Parintins (Brazil); \u00d3bidos (Brazil); Santar\u00e9m (Brazil); Almeirim (Brazil); Macap\u00e1 (Brazil);Manaus (Brazil) |\n| Physical\u00a0characteristics |\n|  |\n| Source | Apur\u00edmac River, Mismi Peak |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0location | Arequipa Region, Peru |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0coordinates | 15\u00b031\u203204\u2033S 71\u00b041\u203237\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff15.51778\u00b0S 71.69361\u00b0W\ufeff / -15.51778; -71.69361 |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0elevation | 5,220\u00a0m (17,130\u00a0ft) |\n|  |\n| Mouth | Atlantic Ocean |\n| \u2022\u00a0location\n | Brazil |\n| \u2022\u00a0coordinates\n | 0\u00b042\u203228\u2033N 50\u00b05\u203222\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff0.70778\u00b0N 50.08944\u00b0W\ufeff / 0.70778; -50.08944[1] |\n| Length | 6,400\u00a0km (4,000\u00a0mi)[n 1] |\n| Basin size | 7,000,000\u00a0km2 (2,700,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi)[2]\n6,743,000\u00a0km2 (2,603,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi)[5] |\n| Width |  |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn July 2008, the Brazilian Institute for Space Research (INPE) published a news article on their webpage, claiming that the Amazon River was 140\u00a0km (87\u00a0mi) longer than the Nile. The Amazon's length was calculated as 6,992\u00a0km (4,345\u00a0mi), taking the Apacheta Creek as its source. Using the same techniques, the length of the Nile was calculated as 6,853\u00a0km (4,258\u00a0mi), which is longer than previous estimates but still shorter than the Amazon. The results were reached by measuring the Amazon downstream to the beginning of the tidal estuary of *Canal do Sul* and then, after a sharp turn back, following tidal canals surrounding the isle of Maraj\u00f3 and finally including the marine waters of the *R\u00edo Par\u00e1* bay in its entire length.[58][20] According to an earlier article on the webpage of the National Geographic, the Amazon's length was calculated as 6,800\u00a0km (4,200\u00a0mi) by a Brazilian scientist. \n</fragment>\n</document>",

[5]\nThe Rukarara is the longest of the streams that supply the Mwogo.[6]\nThe Rukarara flows south and then east, emptying into the Mwogo River. The Mwogo flows north, merging with the Mbirurume River south of Bwakira to become the Nyabarongo River.[6]\n\n\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Hughes, Hughes & Bernacsek 1992, p.\u00a0203.\n2. **^** Brakspear 2008, p.\u00a020.\n3. **^** Dumont 2009, p.\u00a02.\n4. **^** Briggs & Booth 2010, p.\u00a0154.\n5. **^** Nyamagabe Administrative Map.\n6. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ITMB Publishing 2007.\n\n## Sources\n\n[edit]\n\n* Brakspear, Patrick (2008). *On Safari in Africa: 101 Things to Know When You Go*.

With a total length of 351\u00a0km (218\u00a0mi), it is the longest river entirely in Rwanda. It is extended 421\u00a0km (262\u00a0mi) in Lake Rweru including a 69\u00a0km (43\u00a0mi) upper course of Kagera River before joining into Ruvuvu River to form the Kagera River. The river begins its course at the confluence of the rivers Mbirurume and Mwogo in the South West of the country. These two rivers themselves begin in Nyungwe Forest, and are considered by some to be the most distant source of the Nile. From its start, Nyabarongo flows northward for 85\u00a0km (53 miles), and forms the border between the Western and Southern Provinces. At the confluence with the river Mukungwa, the river changes course and flows eastward for 12\u00a0km (7.5 miles), then to a more South Eastern course for the last 200\u00a0km (124 miles). For the longest stretch of this course, the river serves as the boundary between the Northern and Southern Provinces, then between the City of Kigali and the Southern Province, and lastly between the City of Kigali and the Eastern Province.\n\n\nThe river then before enters the Eastern Province and ends its course close to the border with Burundi. The Nyabarongo River empties both into Lake Rweru and the Kagera (or Akagera) river in a small but complicated delta. The Kagera river outflows from Lake Rweru, a mere 1\u00a0km from the Nyabarongo delta. Almost all the branches of the Nyabarongo delta empty in the lake, however, one branch of the delta empties directly in the just formed Kagera river. The Kagera River eventually flows into Lake Victoria and forms the Nile.\n\n\n\n![](image)An aerial of Nyabarongo River from Nyungwe National Park to River Nile. Emmanuel Kwizera\n\n## Origins\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Nyabarongo River originates in southwestern Rwanda to the east of Lake Kivu.[1]\nThe river's sources rise in the mountain chain that covers most of the western third of Rwanda, to the east of the Albertine Rift.[2]\nThe main headwaters in the forested mountain country, originating at heights of 2,600 to 2,750 metres (8,530 to 9,020\u00a0ft) above sea level, are the Mbirurume and Mwogo rivers.[3]\nThe longest of the streams that supply the Mwogo is the Rukarara, which rises in the Nyungwe Forest.[4]\nThe Rukarara flows south and then east, emptying into the Mwogo River. The Mwogo flows north, merging with the Mbirurume River south of Bwakira.\nFrom this confluence, the river assumes the name Nyabarongo.[4]\nThe source of the Rukarara is a contender for the overall source of the Nile, the most distant headwater.[5]\n\n\n\n## Course\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Canoeing on the Nyabarongo\nThe Nyawarungu runs northward through the mountain chain in a deep valley roughly parallel to Lake Kivu and about the same elevation of about 1,500 metres (4,900\u00a0ft).\nAt Muramba it swings to the southeast. On its left bank the Nyabugogo River delivers the outflow from Lake Muhazi.[3]\nAround Kigali the river is used for cooking, drinking and bathing. It also receives sewage and waste from industry and agriculture.[6]\nAbout 35 kilometres (22\u00a0mi) further downstream the Akanyaru river enters on its right bank, to the southwest of Kigali.[3]\n\n\nThe combined river flows east and then southeast through a broad, swampy valley.[3]\nAt the border with Burundi it drains Lake Rweru.\nIt then flows roughly east along the border between Rwanda and Burundi, then between Rwanda and Tanzania, to the point where it is joined by the Ruvuvu River. From there onward it is called the Kagera River, the main affluent of Lake Victoria, which drains into the Nile.[1]\nThe river drains the east of the mountains and most of the central plateau of Rwanda.[2]\n\n\n\n## Wetlands\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)The Nyabarongo River in Rwanda\nSoon after being joined by the Akanyaru, the combined river meanders east and then south through a complex of lakes and wetlands in a flat valley running in a SSE direction, 35 kilometres (22\u00a0mi) wide, which it floods to create a zone of permanent swamps and lakes.\nLake Mugesera lies on the east bank of the river, and is the largest Rwandan lake in the complex.\nLakes Birara and Sake also lie along the left bank of the river.[7]\nThe lakes on the right bank, from north to south, are Gashanga, Kidogo, Rumira, Maravi, Kilimbi, Gaharwa, Rweru and Kanzigiri.[8]\nLake Rweru, which mostly lies in Burundi, drains in a northeast direction into the river through a short swampy section.[9][10]\n\n\nAlthough close to the equator, the climate is comparatively temperate due to the elevation.\nThe rainy seasons are from March to May and again from September to December.[11]\nIn the upper reaches of the wetlands the forest is only flooded seasonally. Further down, common plants are *Ficus verruculosa*, *Myrica kandtiana*, *Phoenix reclinata* and *Cyperus papyrus*.[12]\nThe water is generally around 25\u00a0\u00b0C (77\u00a0\u00b0F).[8]\nFish are abundant, and there are many species of waterbirds. \nOther animals include water turtles, crocodiles, monitors, snakes and otters.[13]\n\n\nThe Nyabarongo River Wetlands is an unprotected area surrounding the course of the Nyabarongo,[14] and covering 142.62 square kilometres (55.07\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). It is of great importance for biodiversity conservation, especially birds, with species such as the endangered Malagasy pond heron (*Ardeola idae*), the near-threatened papyrus gonolek (*Laniarius mufumbiri*), the vulnerable grey crowned crane (*Balearica regulorum*), and the sitatunga (*Tragelaphus spekii*).[15]\nThe wetlands are under serious pressure from agriculture.[16][17]\n\n\nThe following species in the Nyabarongo River Wetlands are red-listed as endangered: papyrus gonolek (*Laniarius mufumbiri*), Carruthers's cisticola (*Cisticola carruthersi*), white-winged scrub-warbler (*Bradypterus carpalis*), papyrus yellow warbler (*Chloropeta gracilirostris*), Sharpe's pied-babbler (*Turdoides sharpei*), northern brown-throated weaver (*Ploceus castanops*), white-collared oliveback (*Nesocharis ansorgei*), and papyrus canary (*Serinus koliensis*).[16][18]\n\n\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n**Citations**\n\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Hughes, Hughes & Bernacsek 1992, p.\u00a097.\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Hughes, Hughes & Bernacsek 1992, p.\u00a0199.\n3. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** Hughes, Hughes & Bernacsek 1992, p.\u00a0201.\n4. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ITMB Publishing 2007.\n5. **^** Grainger 2006.\n6. **^** Gasana et al. 1997, p.\u00a0523.\n7. **^** Hughes, Hughes & Bernacsek 1992, p.\u00a0205.\n8. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Hughes, Hughes & Bernacsek 1992, p.\u00a0206.\n9. **^** Hughes, Hughes & Bernacsek 1992, p.\u00a0125.\n10. **^** \"Exploring the Nyabarongo river\".

Here are the specific details:\n\nLocation: The source is located in Rwanda, specifically in the Nyungwe Forest Reserve.\n\nExact coordinates: 2\u00b016\u2032055.962\u2033S 29\u00b019\u2032052.470\u2033E\n\nElevation: 7,966 feet (2,428 meters) above sea level\n\nThis location was confirmed by a 2005/2006 expedition using modern navigation equipment. The Rukarara River flows into the Mwogo River, which then joins the Mbirurume River to form the Nyabarongo River. The Nyabarongo eventually becomes part of the Kagera River system, which flows into Lake Victoria and ultimately forms the Nile.\n\nThe source is located in forested country in southern Rwanda, east of the Congo-Nile Divide, and the Kamiranzovu Swamp in the Nyungwe Forest Reserve serves as a natural reservoir for the river.",

Thus, over the first 2,600\u00a0km (1,600\u00a0mi) of its length, the river has fallen more than 5,200\u00a0m (17,000\u00a0ft).[46]\n\n\nIt enters the basin of Sichuan at Yibin. While in the Sichuan basin, it receives several mighty tributaries, increasing its water volume significantly. It then cuts through Mount Wushan bordering Chongqing and Hubei to create the famous Three Gorges. Eastward of the Three Gorges, Yichang is the first city on the Yangtze Plain.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0coordinates | 35\u00b027\u203219\u2033N 90\u00b055\u203250\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff35.45528\u00b0N 90.93056\u00b0E\ufeff / 35.45528; 90.93056 |\n|  |\n|  |\n| 4th source | Muluwusu River |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0coordinates | 33\u00b022\u203213\u2033N 91\u00b010\u203229\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff33.37028\u00b0N 91.17472\u00b0E\ufeff / 33.37028; 91.17472 |\n|  |\n|  |\n| 5th source | Bi Qu |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0coordinates | 33\u00b016\u203258\u2033N 91\u00b023\u203229\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff33.28278\u00b0N 91.39139\u00b0E\ufeff / 33.28278; 91.39139 |\n|  |\n| Mouth | East China Sea |\n| \u2022\u00a0location\n | Shanghai and Jiangsu |\n| \u2022\u00a0coordinates\n | 31\u00b023\u203237\u2033N 121\u00b058\u203259\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff31.39361\u00b0N 121.98306\u00b0E\ufeff / 31.39361; 121.98306 |\n| Length | 6,300\u00a0km (3,900\u00a0mi)[1] |\n| Basin size | 1,808,500\u00a0km2 (698,300\u00a0sq\u00a0mi)[2] |\n|  |\n| Discharge |  |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0average | 30,146\u00a0m3/s (1,064,600\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s)[3] |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0minimum | 2,000\u00a0m3/s (71,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s) |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0maximum | 110,000\u00a0m3/s (3,900,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s)[4][5] |\n|  |\n|  |\n| Discharge |  |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0location | Datong hydrometric station, Anhui (Uppermost boundary of the ocean tide) |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0average | (Period: 1980\u20132020)905.7\u00a0km3/a (28,700\u00a0m3/s)[6]\n30,708\u00a0m3/s (1,084,400\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s) (2019\u20132020)[7] |\n|  |\n|  |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Yangtze flows through a wide array of ecosystems and is habitat to several endemic and threatened species including the Chinese alligator, the narrow-ridged finless porpoise, and also was the home of the now extinct Yangtze river dolphin (or *baiji*) and Chinese paddlefish, as well as the Yangtze sturgeon, which is extinct in the wild.

Brower who in 1896 declared it to be the source of the Missouri in his book published by the Pioneer Press titled *The Missouri river and its utmost source*. He visited the site in 1895 and buried a copper plate upon which the name of the river and the date were engraved.[1]\n\n\nThe spring is 100 miles (160\u00a0km) further than the spot Meriwether Lewis reported in 1805 as the source of the river above Lemhi Pass on Trail Creek. Both sources are near the Continental Divide in Montana. It is 298.3 miles (480.1\u00a0km) upstream from where the name \"Missouri River\" is first used.\n\n\nThough the copper plate has not been located, the site of Brower's Spring is believed to be at about 8,800 feet (2,700\u00a0m) [2] on the north fork of where Hell Roaring Creek divides near its source. It is commemorated by a rock pile. Hell Roaring Creek flows west into the Red Rock River, which flows through Upper, then Lower Red Rock Lakes, west through Lima Reservoir, and then northwest into Clark Canyon Reservoir. From Clark Canyon Reservoir the Beaverhead River flows northeast to join the Big Hole River, forming the Jefferson River, which with the Madison and Gallatin Rivers form the Missouri at Missouri River Headwaters State Park at Three Forks, Montana.[3]\n\n\nBrower's location is just below a ridge extending to the southeast from Mt.

Found in the administrative region of the Republic of Buryatia, the wetlands are the habitat of a large number of threatened and endemic species, including the Siberian Baikal sturgeon and over 170 species of birds. The Selenge-Orkhon forest steppe includes the areas of the Orkhon and Selenge river basins. The region has scattered forests and extensive mountain ranges.\n\n\nRiver modifications like the Irkutsk Hydroelectric Power Station have affected the environment of the Selenga Delta, causing it to become waterlogged. Activities including mining, agriculture, breeding and dumping of wastewater have also affected the environment of the river. There has been an observed degradation of water quality from these anthropogenic factors. Natural factors like erosion processes and weathering have also contributed to the decline in water quality.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe volume of water inflow into Lake Baikal during the 1897 flood is estimated to have been approximately 22.2 cubic kilometres (5.3\u00a0cu\u00a0mi).[10] Based on the observations of increased water level during floods, it has been deduced that flooding from the Selenge River can affect the environment of Lake Baikal. It can also cause an increase in runoff from the Angara River.[10]\n\n\n\n## River course\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Selenga River is 1,480 kilometres (920\u00a0mi) long and is formed from the convergence of the Ider and Delger rivers.[11] It flows from Mongolia and into east-central Russia, acting as the main tributary of Lake Baikal.[11]\n\n\nThe Delger River flows from the Sangilen Mountains, \"found on the border between Mongolia and the Russian republic of Tyva\",[11] while the Ider's headwaters are located in the Hangyn Mountains in central Mongolia.[11]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPeriodic annual floods are a feature of the Selenga River. The floods can be classified as \u201cordinary\u201d, \u201clarge\u201d or \u201ccatastrophic\u201d based on the degree of impact. Of the twenty-six documented floods that occurred between 1730 and 1900, three were \u201ccatastrophic\u201d. The three \u201ccatastrophic\u201d floods were the floods of 1830, 1869 and 1897.\n\n\nThe Selenga River basin is a semi-arid region that is 280,000 square kilometres (110,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) in area. It is part of the Arctic Ocean Basin and is located in northern Mongolia. Stone implement artifacts found on the Selenga River at the end of the 19th century have been used to form a link between Native Americans and their ancestors in East Asia. The climate of the Selenga basin is influenced by a powerful Siberian anti-cyclone.

The formation of the delta is dependent on the sediment load carried by the river, with the lake tides having little impact in terms of geographical change.[16] The sediment balance of the delta is dependent on physical processes, and this, in turn, affects the geochemical barrier functions of the area. During the period of the Irkutsk dam construction (1950\u201356), there was \"increased sediment delivery to the delta\" according to an article published in 2017 by Chalov *et al*.[17]\n\n\nThe wetlands of the Selenga River delta are classified as a Ramsar site and are found within the administrative region of the Republic of Buryatia.[18] The wetlands support a large number of threatened and endemic species, including over 170 species of bird.[16] The area has mean air temperatures of 14 degrees Celsius in July and -19.4 degrees Celsius in January, with floods often occurring in summer after heavy rains.[18]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n24. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** ***k*** ***l*** ***m*** ***n*** ***o*** ***p*** ***q*** ***r*** ***s*** ***t*** ***u*** ***v*** ***w*** ***x*** ***y*** ***z*** ***aa*** ***ab*** ***ac*** \"Selenga Delta | Ramsar Sites Information Service\". *rsis.ramsar.org*.

The Ider River is one of the two main source rivers of the Selenga (along with the Delger m\u00f6r\u00f6n).\n\nThe river system's progression from source to sea is as follows:\n1. Ider River (source in Khangai Mountains)\n2. Selenga River (formed by the confluence of Ider and Delger m\u00f6r\u00f6n at Olon Golyn Bilchir, Mongolia)\n3. Lake Baikal (where the Selenga flows into)\n4. Angara River (flows from Lake Baikal)\n5. Yenisei River\n6.
