The varying accuracy and precision also makes it difficult to make length comparisons between different rivers without a degree of uncertainty.\n\n\n\n## List of river systems longer than 1,000 km[edit]\n\n\nFor most rivers, different sources provide conflicting information on the length of a river system. The information in different sources is between parentheses.\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | This list is incomplete; you can help by adding missing items. *(July 2011)*\n |\n\n\n\n\nLegend of colors used in main table, by continent\n| Continent color key\n |\n| --- |\n| Africa | Asia | Australia | Europe | North America | South America |\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThere are many factors, such as the identification of the source,[1] the identification or the definition of the mouth, and the scale of measurement[2] of the river length between source and mouth, that determine the precise meaning of \"river length\". As a result, the length measurements of many rivers are only approximations (see also coastline paradox). In particular, there seems to exist disagreement as to whether the Nile[3] or the Amazon[4] is the world's longest river. The Nile has traditionally been considered longer, but in 2007 and 2008 some scientists claimed that the Amazon is longer[5][6][7] by measuring the river plus the adjacent Pará estuary and the longest connecting tidal canal.[8] A peer-reviewed article published 2009 in the *International Journal of Digital Earth* concludes that the Nile is longer.[9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Rank\n | River\n | Length (km)\n | Length (miles)\n | Drainage area(km2)[*citation needed*] | Average discharge(m3/s)[*citation needed*] | Outflow\n | Countries in the drainage basin [*citation needed*] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1.\n | Nile–White Nile–Kagera–Nyabarongo–Mwogo–Rukarara[n 1] | 6,650[3](7,088)[9] | 4,130[3](4,404)[9] | 3,254,555\n | 2,800\n | Mediterranean | Ethiopia, Eritrea, Sudan, Uganda, Tanzania, Kenya, Rwanda, Burundi, Egypt, Democratic Republic of the Congo, South Sudan |\n| 2.\n | Amazon–Ucayali–Tambo–Ene–Mantaro[n 1] | 6,400[4](6,992)[9] | 3,976[4](4,345)[9] | 7,000,000[4] | 209,000\n | Atlantic Ocean | Brazil, Peru, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Venezuela, Guyana |\n| 3.\n | Yangtze–Jinsha–Tongtian–Dangqu (Chang Jiang) | 6,300(6,418) | 3,917(3,988) | 1,800,000\n | 30,166\n | East China Sea | China |\n| 4.\n | Mississippi–Missouri–Jefferson–Beaverhead–Red Rock–Hell Roaring | 6,275 | 3,902 | 2,980,000\n | 16,792\n | Gulf of Mexico | United States (98.5%), Canada (1.5%)\n |\n| 5.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Scientists debate whether the Amazon or the Nile is the longest river in the world. Traditionally, the Nile is considered longer, but recent information suggests that the Amazon may be longer. Differences in the recorded length of the Amazon mainly depend on whether the course south of the Ilha de Marajó at the Amazon's mouth is to be treated as part of the Amazon, or as part of the separate Tocantins River. New evidence, (dated 16 June 2007) obtained from a high-altitude scientific venture in the Andes, claims that \"the Amazon is longer than the Nile by 100 km, with its longest headwater being the Carhuasanta stream originating in the south of Peru on the Nevado Mismi mountain's northern slopes and flowing into the Río Apurímac\".[29] However, the origin of the river at Nevado Mismi had already been known more than one decade earlier (see Jacek Palkiewicz), and satellite based measuring from this origin to the Amazon mouth has resulted in not more than 6,400 km.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nReferences\n1. **^** \"Where Does the Amazon River Begin?\". *National Geographic News*. 2014-02-15.

That gives the impression that most of the Congo basin was formerly on a much higher land level and that the Congo River was rejuvenated by much of its lower course being removed, likeliest when Africa split from South America when Gondwanaland broke up due to continental drift, and before that, the Congo would likely have flowed into the Amazon,[30] producing a river around 6000 miles or 10,000 km long.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | 952\n |  |  | Yangtze | China\n |\n| 91.\n | Kura/Mt'k'vari | 1,515\n | 941\n | 188,400\n | 575\n | Caspian Sea | Turkey, Georgia, Azerbaijan |\n| 92.\n | Oka | 1,500\n | 932\n | 245,000\n | 1,258\n | Volga | Russia\n |\n| 93.\n | Upper Murray | 1,500[22] | 932 |  |  | Lower Murray | Australia\n |\n| 94.\n | Guaviare | 1,497\n | 930\n |  |  | Orinoco | Colombia\n |\n| 95.\n | Pecos | 1,490\n | 926\n |  |  | Rio Grande | United States\n |\n| 96.\n | Murrumbidgee River | 1,485 [15] | 923\n | 84,917\n | 120\n | Murray River | Australia\n |\n| 97.\n | Upper Yenisey–Little Yenisey (Kaa-Hem) | 1,480\n | 920\n |  |  | Yenisey | Russia, Mongolia\n |\n| 98.\n | Godavari | 1,465\n | 910\n | 312,812\n | 3,061\n | Bay of Bengal | India\n |\n| 99.\n | Colorado (Texas)\n | 1,438\n | 894\n |  |  | Gulf of Mexico\n | United States\n |\n| 100.\n | Upper Tocantins | 1,427\n | 887\n |  |  | Tocantins | Brazil\n |\n| 101.\n | Belaya | 1,420\n | 882\n | 142,000\n | 858\n | Kama | Russia\n |\n| 101.\n | Cooper–Barcoo | 1,420\n | 880\n |  |  | Lake Eyre | Australia\n |\n| 103.\n | Marañón | 1,415\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Lists of rivers\n* List of drainage basins by area\n* List of rivers by discharge\n* List of river films and television series\n\n\n## Notes and references[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |  |  | Mississippi | United States\n |\n| 129.\n | Rhine | 1,233\n | 768\n | 185,000 [27] | 2,330\n | North Sea | Germany (57.3%), Switzerland (15.1%), Netherlands (12.3%), France (12.2%), Luxembourg (1.4%), Austria (1.3%), Belgium (0.4%), Liechtenstein (0.1%), Italy (0.03%)\n |\n| 130.\n | Athabasca | 1,231\n | 765\n | 95,300\n |  | Mackenzie | Canada\n |\n| 131.\n | Canadian | 1,223\n | 760\n |  |  | Arkansas | United States\n |\n| 132.\n | North Saskatchewan | 1,220\n | 758\n |  |  | Saskatchewan | Canada\n |\n| 133.\n | Vistula–Narew-Bug | 1,213\n | 754\n | 194,424\n | 1,080\n | Baltic Sea | Poland, Belarus, Ukraine\n |\n| 134.\n | Vaal | 1,210\n | 752\n |  |  | Orange | South Africa |\n| 135.\n | Shire | 1,200\n | 746\n |  |  | Zambezi | Mozambique, Malawi |\n| 135.\n | Ogooué (or Ogowe) | 1,200\n | 746\n | 223,856\n | 4,706\n | Atlantic Ocean\n | Gabon, Republic of the Congo |\n| 137.\n | Nen (Nonni) | 1,190\n | 739\n |  |  | Songhua | China\n |\n| 138.\n | Kızıl River | 1,182\n | 734\n | 115,000\n | 400\n | Black Sea | Turkey\n |\n| 139.\n | Markha | 1,181\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_0141cbWPGboxYfbbgUj7eHzX","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

Winter winds blow south, up river, so ships could sail up river using sails and down river using the flow of the river. While most Egyptians still live in the Nile valley, the 1970 completion of the Aswan Dam ended the summer floods and their renewal of the fertile soil, fundamentally changing farming practices. The Nile supports much of the population living along its banks, enabling Egyptians to live in otherwise inhospitable regions of the Sahara. The river's flow is disturbed at several points by the Cataracts of the Nile which form an obstacle to navigation by boats. The Sudd also forms a formidable navigation obstacle and impedes water flow, to the extent that Sudan had once attempted to build the Jonglei Canal to bypass the swamp.[81][82]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe source of the White Nile, even after centuries of exploration, remains in dispute. The most remote source that is indisputably a source for the White Nile is the Kagera River; however, the Kagera has tributaries that are in contention for the farthest source of the White Nile. Two start in Burundi: the Ruvyironza River (also known as the Luvironza) and the Rurubu River.[34][33] In addition, in 2010, an exploration party in Rwanda[35] went to a place described as the source of the Rukarara tributary,[36] and by hacking a path up steep jungle-choked mountain slopes in the Nyungwe Forest found (in the dry season) an appreciable incoming surface flow for many kilometres upstream, and found a new source, giving the Nile a length of 6,758 km (4,199 mi).[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### In Uganda[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The Blue Nile Falls fed by Lake Tana near the city of Bahir Dar, Ethiopia\n![](image)Annotated view of the Nile and Red Sea, with a dust storm[43]\nThe Blue Nile (Amharic: ዓባይ, *ʿĀbay*[44][45]) springs from Lake Tana in the Ethiopian Highlands. The Blue Nile flows about 1,400 kilometres to Khartoum, where the Blue Nile and White Nile join to form the Nile.[46] Ninety percent of the water and ninety-six percent of the transported sediment carried by the Nile[47] originates in Ethiopia, with fifty-nine percent of the water from the Blue Nile (the rest being from the Tekezé, Atbarah, Sobat, and small tributaries). The erosion and transportation of silt only occurs during the Ethiopian rainy season when rainfall is especially high in the Ethiopian Highlands; the rest of the year, the great rivers draining Ethiopia into the Nile have a weaker flow. In harsh and arid seasons and droughts, the Blue Nile dries out completely.[48]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNotes\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** The length of the Nile is usually said to be about 6,650 km (4,130 mi),[3] but reported values lie anywhere between 5,499 km (3,417 mi) and 7,088 km (4,404 mi).[4] The measurements of many rivers' lengths are only approximations and may differ from each other because there are many factors that determine the calculated length of a river, such as the position of the geographical source and the mouth, the scale of measurement, and the technique used to measure length (see also List of rivers by length).[4][8]\n2. **^** Arabic: النيل, romanized: *an-Nīl*, Arabic pronunciation: [an'niːl], Bohairic Coptic: ⲫⲓⲁⲣⲟ Coptic pronunciation: [pʰjaˈro],[1] Luganda: *Kiira* Luganda pronunciation: [ki:ra], Nobiin: Áman Dawū[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe **Nile**[b] is a major north-flowing river in northeastern Africa. It flows into the Mediterranean Sea. The Nile is the longest river in Africa and has historically been considered the longest river in the world,[3][4] though this has been contested by research suggesting that the Amazon River is slightly longer.[5][6] Of the world's major rivers, the Nile is one of the smallest, as measured by annual flow in cubic metres of water.[7] About 6,650 km (4,130 mi)[a] long, its drainage basin covers eleven countries: the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Tanzania, Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda, Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, South Sudan, Republic of the Sudan, and Egypt.[9] In particular, the Nile is the primary water source of Egypt, Sudan and South Sudan.[10] Additionally, the Nile is an important economic river, supporting agriculture and fishing.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n60. **^** El Mahmoudi, A.; Gabr, A.

The drainage basin of the Nile covers 3,254,555 square kilometers (1,256,591 sq mi), about 10% of the area of Africa.[28] Compared to other major rivers, though, the Nile carries little water (5% of that of the Congo River, for example).[29] The Nile basin is complex, and because of this, the discharge at any given point along the main stem depends on many factors including weather, diversions, evaporation and evapotranspiration, and groundwater flow.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n81. **^** Shahin, Mamdouh (2002). *Hydrology and Water Resources of Africa*.

In 2009, a peer-reviewed article, was published, concluding that the Nile is longer than the Amazon by stating a length of 7,088 km (4,404 mi) for the Nile and 6,575 km (4,086 mi) for the Amazon, measured by using a combination of satellite image analysis and field investigations to the source regions.[3]\nAccording to the Encyclopædia Britannica, the final length of the Amazon remains open to interpretation and continued debate.[2][20]\n\n\n\n## Watershed[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Amazon basin\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Amazon River*Rio Amazonas*\n |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)Amazon River\n |\n| ![](image)Amazon River and its drainage basin\n |\n| Native name | *Amazonas* (Portuguese) |\n| Location |\n| Country | Peru, Colombia, Brazil |\n| Cities | Iquitos (Peru); Leticia (Colombia); Tabatinga (Brazil); Tefé (Brazil); Itacoatiara (Brazil) Parintins (Brazil); Óbidos (Brazil); Santarém (Brazil); Almeirim (Brazil); Macapá (Brazil);Manaus (Brazil) |\n| Physical characteristics |\n|  |\n| Source | Apurímac River, Mismi Peak |\n|  • location | Arequipa Region, Peru |\n|  • coordinates | 15°31′04″S 71°41′37″W﻿ / ﻿15.51778°S 71.69361°W﻿ / -15.51778; -71.69361 |\n|  • elevation | 5,220 m (17,130 ft) |\n|  |\n| Mouth | Atlantic Ocean |\n| • location\n | Brazil |\n| • coordinates\n | 0°42′28″N 50°5′22″W﻿ / ﻿0.70778°N 50.08944°W﻿ / 0.70778; -50.08944[1] |\n| Length | 6,400 km (4,000 mi)[n 1] |\n| Basin size | 7,000,000 km2 (2,700,000 sq mi)[2]\n6,743,000 km2 (2,603,000 sq mi)[5] |\n| Width |  |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn July 2008, the Brazilian Institute for Space Research (INPE) published a news article on their webpage, claiming that the Amazon River was 140 km (87 mi) longer than the Nile. The Amazon's length was calculated as 6,992 km (4,345 mi), taking the Apacheta Creek as its source. Using the same techniques, the length of the Nile was calculated as 6,853 km (4,258 mi), which is longer than previous estimates but still shorter than the Amazon. The results were reached by measuring the Amazon downstream to the beginning of the tidal estuary of *Canal do Sul* and then, after a sharp turn back, following tidal canals surrounding the isle of Marajó and finally including the marine waters of the *Río Pará* bay in its entire length.[58][20] According to an earlier article on the webpage of the National Geographic, the Amazon's length was calculated as 6,800 km (4,200 mi) by a Brazilian scientist. \n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_01XUMGsqvpKQ4EUtf4TCGnrv","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

With a total length of 351 km (218 mi), it is the longest river entirely in Rwanda. It is extended 421 km (262 mi) in Lake Rweru including a 69 km (43 mi) upper course of Kagera River before joining into Ruvuvu River to form the Kagera River. The river begins its course at the confluence of the rivers Mbirurume and Mwogo in the South West of the country. These two rivers themselves begin in Nyungwe Forest, and are considered by some to be the most distant source of the Nile. From its start, Nyabarongo flows northward for 85 km (53 miles), and forms the border between the Western and Southern Provinces. At the confluence with the river Mukungwa, the river changes course and flows eastward for 12 km (7.5 miles), then to a more South Eastern course for the last 200 km (124 miles). For the longest stretch of this course, the river serves as the boundary between the Northern and Southern Provinces, then between the City of Kigali and the Southern Province, and lastly between the City of Kigali and the Eastern Province.\n\n\nThe river then before enters the Eastern Province and ends its course close to the border with Burundi. The Nyabarongo River empties both into Lake Rweru and the Kagera (or Akagera) river in a small but complicated delta. The Kagera river outflows from Lake Rweru, a mere 1 km from the Nyabarongo delta. Almost all the branches of the Nyabarongo delta empty in the lake, however, one branch of the delta empties directly in the just formed Kagera river. The Kagera River eventually flows into Lake Victoria and forms the Nile.\n\n\n\n![](image)An aerial of Nyabarongo River from Nyungwe National Park to River Nile. Emmanuel Kwizera\n\n## Origins\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Nyabarongo River originates in southwestern Rwanda to the east of Lake Kivu.[1]\nThe river's sources rise in the mountain chain that covers most of the western third of Rwanda, to the east of the Albertine Rift.[2]\nThe main headwaters in the forested mountain country, originating at heights of 2,600 to 2,750 metres (8,530 to 9,020 ft) above sea level, are the Mbirurume and Mwogo rivers.[3]\nThe longest of the streams that supply the Mwogo is the Rukarara, which rises in the Nyungwe Forest.[4]\nThe Rukarara flows south and then east, emptying into the Mwogo River. The Mwogo flows north, merging with the Mbirurume River south of Bwakira.\nFrom this confluence, the river assumes the name Nyabarongo.[4]\nThe source of the Rukarara is a contender for the overall source of the Nile, the most distant headwater.[5]\n\n\n\n## Course\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Canoeing on the Nyabarongo\nThe Nyawarungu runs northward through the mountain chain in a deep valley roughly parallel to Lake Kivu and about the same elevation of about 1,500 metres (4,900 ft).\nAt Muramba it swings to the southeast. On its left bank the Nyabugogo River delivers the outflow from Lake Muhazi.[3]\nAround Kigali the river is used for cooking, drinking and bathing. It also receives sewage and waste from industry and agriculture.[6]\nAbout 35 kilometres (22 mi) further downstream the Akanyaru river enters on its right bank, to the southwest of Kigali.[3]\n\n\nThe combined river flows east and then southeast through a broad, swampy valley.[3]\nAt the border with Burundi it drains Lake Rweru.\nIt then flows roughly east along the border between Rwanda and Burundi, then between Rwanda and Tanzania, to the point where it is joined by the Ruvuvu River. From there onward it is called the Kagera River, the main affluent of Lake Victoria, which drains into the Nile.[1]\nThe river drains the east of the mountains and most of the central plateau of Rwanda.[2]\n\n\n\n## Wetlands\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)The Nyabarongo River in Rwanda\nSoon after being joined by the Akanyaru, the combined river meanders east and then south through a complex of lakes and wetlands in a flat valley running in a SSE direction, 35 kilometres (22 mi) wide, which it floods to create a zone of permanent swamps and lakes.\nLake Mugesera lies on the east bank of the river, and is the largest Rwandan lake in the complex.\nLakes Birara and Sake also lie along the left bank of the river.[7]\nThe lakes on the right bank, from north to south, are Gashanga, Kidogo, Rumira, Maravi, Kilimbi, Gaharwa, Rweru and Kanzigiri.[8]\nLake Rweru, which mostly lies in Burundi, drains in a northeast direction into the river through a short swampy section.[9][10]\n\n\nAlthough close to the equator, the climate is comparatively temperate due to the elevation.\nThe rainy seasons are from March to May and again from September to December.[11]\nIn the upper reaches of the wetlands the forest is only flooded seasonally. Further down, common plants are *Ficus verruculosa*, *Myrica kandtiana*, *Phoenix reclinata* and *Cyperus papyrus*.[12]\nThe water is generally around 25 °C (77 °F).[8]\nFish are abundant, and there are many species of waterbirds. \nOther animals include water turtles, crocodiles, monitors, snakes and otters.[13]\n\n\nThe Nyabarongo River Wetlands is an unprotected area surrounding the course of the Nyabarongo,[14] and covering 142.62 square kilometres (55.07 sq mi). It is of great importance for biodiversity conservation, especially birds, with species such as the endangered Malagasy pond heron (*Ardeola idae*), the near-threatened papyrus gonolek (*Laniarius mufumbiri*), the vulnerable grey crowned crane (*Balearica regulorum*), and the sitatunga (*Tragelaphus spekii*).[15]\nThe wetlands are under serious pressure from agriculture.[16][17]\n\n\nThe following species in the Nyabarongo River Wetlands are red-listed as endangered: papyrus gonolek (*Laniarius mufumbiri*), Carruthers's cisticola (*Cisticola carruthersi*), white-winged scrub-warbler (*Bradypterus carpalis*), papyrus yellow warbler (*Chloropeta gracilirostris*), Sharpe's pied-babbler (*Turdoides sharpei*), northern brown-throated weaver (*Ploceus castanops*), white-collared oliveback (*Nesocharis ansorgei*), and papyrus canary (*Serinus koliensis*).[16][18]\n\n\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n**Citations**\n\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Hughes, Hughes & Bernacsek 1992, p. 97.\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Hughes, Hughes & Bernacsek 1992, p. 199.\n3. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** Hughes, Hughes & Bernacsek 1992, p. 201.\n4. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ITMB Publishing 2007.\n5. **^** Grainger 2006.\n6. **^** Gasana et al. 1997, p. 523.\n7. **^** Hughes, Hughes & Bernacsek 1992, p. 205.\n8. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Hughes, Hughes & Bernacsek 1992, p. 206.\n9. **^** Hughes, Hughes & Bernacsek 1992, p. 125.\n10. **^** \"Exploring the Nyabarongo river\".

Brower who in 1896 declared it to be the source of the Missouri in his book published by the Pioneer Press titled *The Missouri river and its utmost source*. He visited the site in 1895 and buried a copper plate upon which the name of the river and the date were engraved.[1]\n\n\nThe spring is 100 miles (160 km) further than the spot Meriwether Lewis reported in 1805 as the source of the river above Lemhi Pass on Trail Creek. Both sources are near the Continental Divide in Montana. It is 298.3 miles (480.1 km) upstream from where the name \"Missouri River\" is first used.\n\n\nThough the copper plate has not been located, the site of Brower's Spring is believed to be at about 8,800 feet (2,700 m) [2] on the north fork of where Hell Roaring Creek divides near its source. It is commemorated by a rock pile. Hell Roaring Creek flows west into the Red Rock River, which flows through Upper, then Lower Red Rock Lakes, west through Lima Reservoir, and then northwest into Clark Canyon Reservoir. From Clark Canyon Reservoir the Beaverhead River flows northeast to join the Big Hole River, forming the Jefferson River, which with the Madison and Gallatin Rivers form the Missouri at Missouri River Headwaters State Park at Three Forks, Montana.[3]\n\n\nBrower's location is just below a ridge extending to the southeast from Mt. Jefferson 2 miles (3 km) to the northwest, and is 1.6 miles (2.6 km) southwest of the Sawtell Peak Observatory in Idaho, about 20 miles (32 km) southwest of West Yellowstone, Montana, and about 1,600 feet (500 m) southwest of the nearest point on the North American Continental Divide. \n\n\nBrower's Spring is not listed as an official name on the Geographic Names Information System maintained by USGS.[4]\n\n\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n1. **^** Brower, Jacob (1896). *The Missouri river and its utmost source;*.

Found in the administrative region of the Republic of Buryatia, the wetlands are the habitat of a large number of threatened and endemic species, including the Siberian Baikal sturgeon and over 170 species of birds. The Selenge-Orkhon forest steppe includes the areas of the Orkhon and Selenge river basins. The region has scattered forests and extensive mountain ranges.\n\n\nRiver modifications like the Irkutsk Hydroelectric Power Station have affected the environment of the Selenga Delta, causing it to become waterlogged. Activities including mining, agriculture, breeding and dumping of wastewater have also affected the environment of the river. There has been an observed degradation of water quality from these anthropogenic factors. Natural factors like erosion processes and weathering have also contributed to the decline in water quality.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe volume of water inflow into Lake Baikal during the 1897 flood is estimated to have been approximately 22.2 cubic kilometres (5.3 cu mi).[10] Based on the observations of increased water level during floods, it has been deduced that flooding from the Selenge River can affect the environment of Lake Baikal. It can also cause an increase in runoff from the Angara River.[10]\n\n\n\n## River course\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Selenga River is 1,480 kilometres (920 mi) long and is formed from the convergence of the Ider and Delger rivers.[11] It flows from Mongolia and into east-central Russia, acting as the main tributary of Lake Baikal.[11]\n\n\nThe Delger River flows from the Sangilen Mountains, \"found on the border between Mongolia and the Russian republic of Tyva\",[11] while the Ider's headwaters are located in the Hangyn Mountains in central Mongolia.[11]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPeriodic annual floods are a feature of the Selenga River. The floods can be classified as “ordinary”, “large” or “catastrophic” based on the degree of impact. Of the twenty-six documented floods that occurred between 1730 and 1900, three were “catastrophic”. The three “catastrophic” floods were the floods of 1830, 1869 and 1897.\n\n\nThe Selenga River basin is a semi-arid region that is 280,000 square kilometres (110,000 sq mi) in area. It is part of the Arctic Ocean Basin and is located in northern Mongolia. Stone implement artifacts found on the Selenga River at the end of the 19th century have been used to form a link between Native Americans and their ancestors in East Asia. The climate of the Selenga basin is influenced by a powerful Siberian anti-cyclone. The weather consists of harsh winters and warm summers, with the river freezing from November to April.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThere are ten large-scale wastewater treatment plants in the Selenge River basin in Mongolia.[26] These wastewater treatment plants are located in the Mongolian cities of Tsetserleg, Bulgan, Darkhan City, Uliastai, Erdenet City, Arvaikheer, Sukhbaatar, Zuunmod, Murun and Ulaanbaatar.[26]\n\n\nThe city of Ulan-Ude uses the Selenga River as its primary source of water for its municipal water supply, using 60 wells with submersible pumps to withdraw water.[9] The total pumped water in 2009 was 56.68 million cubic metres (14.97 billion US gallons).[9]\n\n\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]\n\n* Baikal sturgeon\n* Irkutsk Hydroelectric Power Station\n* List of rivers of Mongolia\n* List of rivers of Russia\n* Selenga Highlands\n* Ulaanbaatar\n\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nLobate shaped and 40 km wide, the Selenga River delta is surrounded by marshlands. The formation of the delta is dependent on the sediment load carried by the river, with the lake tides having little impact in terms of geographical change.[16] The sediment balance of the delta is dependent on physical processes, and this, in turn, affects the geochemical barrier functions of the area. During the period of the Irkutsk dam construction (1950–56), there was \"increased sediment delivery to the delta\" according to an article published in 2017 by Chalov *et al*.[17]\n\n\nThe wetlands of the Selenga River delta are classified as a Ramsar site and are found within the administrative region of the Republic of Buryatia.[18] The wetlands support a large number of threatened and endemic species, including over 170 species of bird.[16] The area has mean air temperatures of 14 degrees Celsius in July and -19.4 degrees Celsius in January, with floods often occurring in summer after heavy rains.[18]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n24. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** ***k*** ***l*** ***m*** ***n*** ***o*** ***p*** ***q*** ***r*** ***s*** ***t*** ***u*** ***v*** ***w*** ***x*** ***y*** ***z*** ***aa*** ***ab*** ***ac*** \"Selenga Delta | Ramsar Sites Information Service\". *rsis.ramsar.org*.
