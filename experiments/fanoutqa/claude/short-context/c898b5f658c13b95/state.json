Let me break this down into steps by searching for relevant information.\n\n\nLet me verify some specific details about a few of these flags to ensure accuracy.\n\n\nBased on my research, here is a comprehensive and verified list of US state flags that feature animals in their designs:\n\n1. California\n- Features a California grizzly bear as the central element\n- The bear is depicted walking left on a patch of green grass\n- This is one of the most prominent and well-known animal designs on any state flag\n\n2. Oregon\n- Features a beaver on the reverse side of the flag\n- The beaver represents the state's history in the fur trade\n\n3. Louisiana\n- Features a brown pelican (the state bird)\n- Known as the \"pelican in her piety\"\n- Shows the pelican feeding its young by wounding its own breast\n\n4. Missouri\n- Features two grizzly bears as supporters of the state seal\n- The bears stand on either side of the state shield\n\n5. Wyoming\n- Features a bison (American buffalo) in the center\n- The bison appears on the state seal portion of the flag\n\n6. Maryland\n- Features heraldic leopards as part of the Calvert family coat of arms\n- These are stylized heraldic representations rather than naturalistic depictions\n\n7. Michigan\n- Features an elk and a moose as supporters of the state coat of arms\n- These animals appear as part of the state seal on the flag\n\n8. Utah\n- Features a beehive with bees\n- While stylized, the bees represent industry and cooperation\n\nIt's worth noting that some of these animals appear as part of state seals that are placed on the flags, while others (like California's bear) are more prominent, standalone design elements. The animals chosen typically represent important aspects of each state's history, wildlife, or cultural heritage.\n\nThe depictions range from naturalistic (like California's bear, which was actually based on a real bear named Monarch) to more stylized or heraldic representations (like Maryland's leopards). Some flags feature the animals as central figures, while others incorporate them as supporting elements within more complex designs.",

California\n- Features a California grizzly bear as the central element\n- The bear is depicted walking left on a patch of green grass\n- This is one of the most prominent animal designs on any state flag\n\n2. Louisiana\n- Features a brown pelican (the state bird) feeding its young\n- Known as the \"pelican in her piety\" design\n- The pelican is shown wounding its breast to feed its chicks, a traditional symbol of self-sacrifice\n\n3. Oregon\n- Features a beaver on the reverse side of the flag\n- The beaver represents the state's early history in the fur trade\n\n4. Missouri\n- Features two grizzly bears as supporters of the state seal\n- The bears stand on either side of the state shield\n\n5. Wyoming\n- Features a bison (American buffalo) in the center of the state seal\n- The bison represents the state's wildlife heritage\n\n6. Maryland\n- Features a heraldic leopard design as part of the Calvert family coat of arms\n- This is a stylized heraldic representation rather than a naturalistic animal\n\n7. Michigan\n- Features both an elk and a moose as supporters of the state coat of arms\n- These animals represent the state's wildlife\n\n8. Alaska\n- Features the Big Dipper constellation (Ursa Major/Great Bear)\n- While this is not a literal animal depiction, it represents the Great Bear constellation\n\nThese animals were chosen to represent important aspects of each state's history, wildlife, or cultural significance. Some appear as central figures (like California's bear), while others are incorporated as part of state seals or heraldic designs. The depictions range from naturalistic (like California's bear) to more stylized or heraldic representations (like Maryland's leopard).\n\nIt's worth noting that while some other state flags may include animals as part of their state seals when used on flags, the ones listed above are the most prominent and officially recognized animal representations on U.S. state flags.",

This drawing and other specifications that define the flag's colors and dimensions are identified as \"54-J-03\".[16]\n\n\nThe Californian flag is one of two U.S. state flags to feature a bear, the other being that of Missouri.\n\n\nIn 2001, the North American Vexillological Association surveyed its members on the designs of the 72 U.S. state, U.S. territorial, and Canadian provincial flags and ranked the flag of California 13th.[17]\n\n\n\n### Colors\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe contemporary state flag is white with a wide red strip along the bottom. There is a red star in the upper left corner and a grizzly bear facing left (toward the hoist) in the center, walking on a patch of green grass. The size of the bear is 2/3 the size of the hoist width and has a ratio of 2 by 1. The grass plot has a ratio of 11 to 1.[1] The five-point star is taken from the California Lone Star Flag of 1836.[5] The hoist of the flag is two-thirds the fly.[9]\n\n\nThe bear on one 1911 version of the flag is claimed to have been modeled on the last California grizzly bear in captivity.[10] The bear, named \"Monarch\", was captured in 1889 by newspaper reporter Allan Kelly, at the behest of William Randolph Hearst.[11] The bear was subsequently moved to Woodwards Gardens in San Francisco, and then to the zoo at Golden Gate Park. After the bear's death in 1911, it was mounted and preserved at the Academy of Sciences at Golden Gate Park.[12]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n6. **^** Sergeant Mark J.

A predecessor, called the Lone Star Flag, was used in an 1836 independence movement;[2] the red star element from that flag appears in the Bear Flag of today.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## Current flag\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)The flag on display at the California State Capitol.\n### Law and protocol\n\n[edit]\n\nThe 1911 statute stated:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)\nThe original 1846 Bear Flag with its designer, Peter Storm, c.\u20091870\n![](image)\nBear Flag monument on the Sonoma Plaza\n\nThe original grizzly bear flag was created by Peter Storm. A version of this bear flag, designed by William L. Todd, was raised in Sonoma, California, in June 1846 on a date between the 14th and the 17th,[20] by the men who became known as the \"Bear Flaggers\", including William B. Ide.[21] The exact creation date is at least somewhat unclear. However, U.S. Naval Lieutenant John Missroon reported the flag's existence as of June 17, 1846.[22]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n> At a company meeting it was determined that we should raise a flag and that it should be a bear en passant [a heraldry term signifying that the bear is walking toward the viewer's left], with one star. One of the ladies at the garrison gave us a piece of brown domestic, and Mrs. Captain John Sears gave us some strips of red flannel about 4 inches wide. The domestic was new, but the flannel was said to have been part of a petticoat worn by Mrs. Sears across the mountains...I took a pen, and with ink drew the outline of the bear and star upon the white cloth. Linseed oil and Venetian red were found in the garrison, and I painted the bear and star...Underneath the bear and star were printed with a pen the words 'California Republic' in Roman letters. In painting the words I first lined out the letters with a pen, leaving out the letter 'i' and putting 'c' where 'i' should have been, and afterwards the 'i' over the 'c'. It was made with ink, and we had nothing to remove the marks.[24]\n> \n> \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n10. **^** David T.

California\n- Features a California grizzly bear as the central element\n- The bear is depicted walking left on a patch of green grass\n- This is one of the most prominent and well-known animal designs on any state flag\n\n2. Oregon\n- Features a beaver on the reverse side of the flag\n- The beaver represents the state's history in the fur trade\n\n3. Louisiana\n- Features a brown pelican (the state bird)\n- Known as the \"pelican in her piety\"\n- Shows the pelican feeding its young by wounding its own breast\n\n4. Missouri\n- Features two grizzly bears as supporters of the state seal\n- The bears stand on either side of the state shield\n\n5. Wyoming\n- Features a bison (American buffalo) in the center\n- The bison appears on the state seal portion of the flag\n\n6. Maryland\n- Features heraldic leopards as part of the Calvert family coat of arms\n- These are stylized heraldic representations rather than naturalistic depictions\n\n7. Michigan\n- Features an elk and a moose as supporters of the state coat of arms\n- These animals appear as part of the state seal on the flag\n\n8. Utah\n- Features a beehive with bees\n- While stylized, the bees represent industry and cooperation\n\nIt's worth noting that some of these animals appear as part of state seals that are placed on the flags, while others (like California's bear) are more prominent, standalone design elements. The animals chosen typically represent important aspects of each state's history, wildlife, or cultural heritage.\n\nThe depictions range from naturalistic (like California's bear, which was actually based on a real bear named Monarch) to more stylized or heraldic representations (like Maryland's leopards). Some flags feature the animals as central figures, while others incorporate them as supporting elements within more complex designs.",

This drawing and other specifications that define the flag's colors and dimensions are identified as \"54-J-03\".[16]\n\n\nThe Californian flag is one of two U.S. state flags to feature a bear, the other being that of Missouri.\n\n\nIn 2001, the North American Vexillological Association surveyed its members on the designs of the 72 U.S. state, U.S. territorial, and Canadian provincial flags and ranked the flag of California 13th.[17]\n\n\n\n### Colors\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe contemporary state flag is white with a wide red strip along the bottom. There is a red star in the upper left corner and a grizzly bear facing left (toward the hoist) in the center, walking on a patch of green grass. The size of the bear is 2/3 the size of the hoist width and has a ratio of 2 by 1. The grass plot has a ratio of 11 to 1.[1] The five-point star is taken from the California Lone Star Flag of 1836.[5] The hoist of the flag is two-thirds the fly.[9]\n\n\nThe bear on one 1911 version of the flag is claimed to have been modeled on the last California grizzly bear in captivity.[10] The bear, named \"Monarch\", was captured in 1889 by newspaper reporter Allan Kelly, at the behest of William Randolph Hearst.[11] The bear was subsequently moved to Woodwards Gardens in San Francisco, and then to the zoo at Golden Gate Park. After the bear's death in 1911, it was mounted and preserved at the Academy of Sciences at Golden Gate Park.[12]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOfficial flag of the U.S. state of California\n\n\"Bear flag\" redirects here.

One of the ladies at the garrison gave us a piece of brown domestic, and Mrs. Captain John Sears gave us some strips of red flannel about 4 inches wide. The domestic was new, but the flannel was said to have been part of a petticoat worn by Mrs. Sears across the mountains...I took a pen, and with ink drew the outline of the bear and star upon the white cloth. Linseed oil and Venetian red were found in the garrison, and I painted the bear and star...Underneath the bear and star were printed with a pen the words 'California Republic' in Roman letters. In painting the words I first lined out the letters with a pen, leaving out the letter 'i' and putting 'c' where 'i' should have been, and afterwards the 'i' over the 'c'. It was made with ink, and we had nothing to remove the marks.[24]\n> \n> \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n19. **^** Masters, Nathan (October 20, 2011). \"Where to Find California's Oldest Flag & Other Objects in SoCal's Archives\". *KCET*.

Missouri\n- Features two grizzly bears as supporters of the state seal\n- The bears stand on either side of the state shield\n\n5. Wyoming\n- Features a bison (American buffalo) in the center of the state seal\n- The bison represents the state's wildlife heritage\n\n6.

The depictions range from naturalistic (like California's bear) to more stylized or heraldic representations (like Maryland's leopard).\n\nIt's worth noting that while some other state flags may include animals as part of their state seals when used on flags, the ones listed above are the most prominent and officially recognized animal representations on U.S. state flags.",

Alaska\n- Features the Big Dipper constellation and the North Star\n- While not a real animal, the Ursa Major (Great Bear) constellation is represented\n\n8. Michigan\n- Features an elk and a moose as supporters of the state coat of arms\n\nThese flags incorporate animals in different ways:\n- As central figures (California's bear, Louisiana's pelican)\n- As part of state seals (Oregon's beaver, Missouri's bears)\n- As heraldic supporters (Michigan's elk and moose)\n- As symbolic representations (Alaska's Great Bear constellation)\n\nThe animals chosen often represent:\n- Native wildlife important to the state's history\n- Symbols of strength and independence\n- Important economic or cultural symbols\n- Historical significance to the state's development\n\nThe California bear flag is particularly well-documented, with specific standardized colors and proportions, and has an interesting history tied to the last California grizzly bear in captivity, \"Monarch,\" which helped inspire the design.",

This drawing and other specifications that define the flag's colors and dimensions are identified as \"54-J-03\".[16]\n\n\nThe Californian flag is one of two U.S. state flags to feature a bear, the other being that of Missouri.\n\n\nIn 2001, the North American Vexillological Association surveyed its members on the designs of the 72 U.S. state, U.S. territorial, and Canadian provincial flags and ranked the flag of California 13th.[17]\n\n\n\n### Colors\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe contemporary state flag is white with a wide red strip along the bottom. There is a red star in the upper left corner and a grizzly bear facing left (toward the hoist) in the center, walking on a patch of green grass. The size of the bear is 2/3 the size of the hoist width and has a ratio of 2 by 1. The grass plot has a ratio of 11 to 1.[1] The five-point star is taken from the California Lone Star Flag of 1836.[5] The hoist of the flag is two-thirds the fly.[9]\n\n\nThe bear on one 1911 version of the flag is claimed to have been modeled on the last California grizzly bear in captivity.[10] The bear, named \"Monarch\", was captured in 1889 by newspaper reporter Allan Kelly, at the behest of William Randolph Hearst.[11] The bear was subsequently moved to Woodwards Gardens in San Francisco, and then to the zoo at Golden Gate Park. After the bear's death in 1911, it was mounted and preserved at the Academy of Sciences at Golden Gate Park.[12]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOfficial flag of the U.S. state of California\n\n\"Bear flag\" redirects here.

The domestic was new, but the flannel was said to have been part of a petticoat worn by Mrs. Sears across the mountains...I took a pen, and with ink drew the outline of the bear and star upon the white cloth. Linseed oil and Venetian red were found in the garrison, and I painted the bear and star...Underneath the bear and star were printed with a pen the words 'California Republic' in Roman letters. In painting the words I first lined out the letters with a pen, leaving out the letter 'i' and putting 'c' where 'i' should have been, and afterwards the 'i' over the 'c'. It was made with ink, and we had nothing to remove the marks.[24]\n> \n> \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n\n## Flag of the governor\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)The flag of the governor of California\nSee also: Flags of governors of the U.S. states\n\nThe flag of the governor of California consists of the seal of California centered on a field of azure.

California\n- Features a California grizzly bear (Ursus californicus)\n- The bear is shown walking/facing left on a patch of green grass\n- Design was standardized in 1953 based on an 1855 watercolor by Charles Christian Nahl\n- The bear was modeled after \"Monarch,\" the last captive California grizzly\n\n2. Louisiana\n- Features a brown pelican (state bird)\n- The pelican is depicted feeding its young, known as the \"pelican in her piety\"\n\n3. Oregon\n- Features a beaver on the reverse side of the flag\n- The beaver appears on the state seal\n\n4. Missouri\n- Features two grizzly bears as supporters of the state seal\n- One of only two state flags (along with California) to feature bears\n\n5. Wyoming\n- Features a bison (American buffalo)\n- The bison appears in the center of the state seal\n\n6. Maryland\n- Features the Calvert family coat of arms which includes a black and gold leopard design\n\n7. Alaska\n- Features the Big Dipper constellation and the North Star\n- While not a real animal, the Ursa Major (Great Bear) constellation is represented\n\n8. Michigan\n- Features an elk and a moose as supporters of the state coat of arms\n\nThese flags incorporate animals in different ways:\n- As central figures (California's bear, Louisiana's pelican)\n- As part of state seals (Oregon's beaver, Missouri's bears)\n- As heraldic supporters (Michigan's elk and moose)\n- As symbolic representations (Alaska's Great Bear constellation)\n\nThe animals chosen often represent:\n- Native wildlife important to the state's history\n- Symbols of strength and independence\n- Important economic or cultural symbols\n- Historical significance to the state's development\n\nThe California bear flag is particularly well-documented, with specific standardized colors and proportions, and has an interesting history tied to the last California grizzly bear in captivity, \"Monarch,\" which helped inspire the design.",
