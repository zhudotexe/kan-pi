She also reached No. 15 with \"Shake It Off\" and No. 69 with \"It's Like That\" featuring Jermaine Dupri and Fatman Scoop.\nThe *Billboard* Hot 100 is a chart that ranks the best-performing singles of the United States. Its data, published by *Billboard* magazine and compiled by Nielsen SoundScan, is based collectively on each single's weekly physical and digital sales, as well as airplay and streaming. At the end of a year, *Billboard* will publish an annual list of the 100 most successful songs throughout that year on the Hot 100 chart based on the information. For 2005, the list was published on December 20, calculated with data from December 4, 2004, to November 26, 2005.[1] The R&B track \"We Belong Together\" by American singer Mariah Carey was named the number 1 song of 2005 and it spent the longest time at number 1 for the year, 14 weeks. This is also the third-longest time at number 1 for a single in the 57-year history of the Hot 100 post-1958 inception, after Mariah Carey's own collaboration with Boyz II Men, \"One Sweet Day\", which spent 16 weeks atop the Hot 100 from 1995 to 1996, and \"Despacito\" by Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee, featuring Justin Bieber, which equaled that mark in 2017, both being beaten in 2019 by \"Old Town Road\" by Lil Nas X and Billy Ray Cyrus, which had 19 weeks at No. 1.\n\n\n\n## List[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rapper 50 Cent had six songs on the chart, five of them in the top 40, the highest one being \"Candy Shop\" at number eight.\n![](image)Singer Ciara had four songs in the top 40 of the chart, the highest one being \"1, 2 Step\" at number five.\n![](image)The Black Eyed Peas had three

Angel. Music. Baby.* (2004). It is a hip-hop song that draws influence from 1980s hip-hop and dance music. The song was written by Stefani, Pharrell Williams, and Chad Hugo, with the latter two handling production as the Neptunes. The song was released as the album's third single on March 22, 2005, and was one of the year's most popular songs, peaking inside the top 10 of the majority of the charts it entered. It reached number one in Australia and the United States, where it became the first digital download to sell one million copies.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n31. **^** \"Single Review: Gwen Stefani - Hollaback Girl\". *Drowned In Sound*.

Since the song interpolates lyrics from Bobby Womack's \"If You Think You're Lonely Now\" (1981) and the Deele's \"Two Occasions\" (1987), the songwriters of those respective songs are credited. \"We Belong Together\" is built on a simple piano arrangement with an understated backbeat.

Carey's vocal range is demonstrated with a greater emphasis in the ending chorus, where the chorus is raised an octave higher, lying from G4 to A5.[11] As such, Carey ends with an anticipated coda, completing both the chorus and the song with a potent, belted note of C5 for approximately four semibreves (around 17 seconds).[11] It follows the common verse-chorus form and is structured into three sections that portray the protagonist in a range of emotions; from doleful and resigned in the first section, to desperate and agitated in the second.[12] In the last section the song climaxes with an octave raise, which not only emphasizes the protagonist's heightened desperation, but her determination to be with her lover.[12] The song is written in the key of C major with a slow tempo of 70 beats per minute. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDuring the week of September 25, 2005, Carey set another record, becoming the first female to occupy the first two spots atop the Hot 100, as \"We Belong Together\" remained at number one, and her next single, \"Shake It Off\", held the number two spot.[27] Additionally, the song held the top position on the official Hot 100 Airplay chart for sixteen weeks, tying for the second all time spot with No Doubt's \"Don't Speak\" (1996).[27] \"We Belong Together\" was certified 4× Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), denoting shipments of 4 million copies throughout the United States.[32] On the *Billboard* Hot 100 Year-end Chart of 2005, the song was declared the number one song, a career first for Carey.[33] *Billboard* listed \"We Belong Together\" ninth on the Billboard Hot 100 All-Time Top Songs[34] and second on Top Billboard Hot 100 R&B/Hip-Hop Songs.[35] On the Hot 100, \"We Belong Together\" spent 23 consecutive weeks in the top ten and 43 weeks total on the chart, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe song's music video premiered worldwide on April 11, 2005, although MSN offered an exclusive look at the music video on April 9.

Angel. Music. Baby.* (2004). It is a hip-hop song that draws influence from 1980s hip-hop and dance music. The song was written by Stefani, Pharrell Williams, and Chad Hugo, with the latter two handling production as the Neptunes. The song was released as the album's third single on March 22, 2005, and was one of the year's most popular songs, peaking inside the top 10 of the majority of the charts it entered. It reached number one in Australia and the United States, where it became the first digital download to sell one million copies.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n2005 single by Gwen Stefani\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| \"Hollaback Girl\" |\n| --- |\n| ![A collage of shots from the single's music video, portraying Stefani.](image) |\n| Single by Gwen Stefani |\n| from the album  *Love.

The two decided that Stefani did not have to have an answer for her intentions and that the choices she made were based on what she felt was wrong or right.[2] On its creation, Stefani said, \"To me, it is the freshest attitude song I've heard in so long.\" Pharrell was pleased with the song, commenting, \"Gwen is like the girl in high school who just had her own style.\"[3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n13. **^** \"Gwen Stefani – Hollaback Girl – Video Streams\". *Contactmusic.com*.

The song, which was written and produced by Max Martin and Lukasz \"Dr. Luke\" Gottwald, was released as the lead single from *Breakaway* two weeks before the album was released. It is an uptempo pop rock and power pop power ballad that infuses electronic sounds with a mixture of a soft and loud pop rock sound. Martin originally wrote \"Since U Been Gone\" with Pink in mind, but she turned it down. It was then given to Hilary Duff, but she rejected the song because she could not reach its higher notes. The song was finally given to Clarkson after Clive Davis convinced the writers to give it to her. Clarkson decided to add heavier guitars and harder drums to the song after noticing that the demo had an obvious pop sound. Lyrically, the song is written from a woman's point of view where she expresses her sense of relief with the end of her troubled relationship.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| \"Since U Been Gone\" |\n| --- |\n| ![A front face image of Kelly Clarkson.

My record label was freaking out about it and I was, like, why?\"[11] Clarkson also explained that when she first heard \"Since U Been Gone\", she felt that it sounded a little bit pop for her direction, and she decided to tweak the song musically by incorporating drums and guitars.[1] Clarkson told MTV that the song is about a relationship turned sour although it was going well at the very beginning.[6] The song was officially released to mainstream radio stations in the United States on November 16, 2004, as the lead single of *Breakaway*.[12]\n\n\n\n## Composition[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\n\"Since U Been Gone\" (2004)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nClarkson performed \"Since U Been Gone\" at the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards and at the 2006 BRIT Awards. It has been included on the set-list of Clarkson's many tours. The song's accompanying music video was directed by Alex De Rakoff, which shows Clarkson ruining her ex-boyfriend's apartment. The music video was nominated for three awards in the 2005 MTV Music Awards, winning two out of the three awards namely Best Female Video and Best Pop Video. At the 48th Grammy Awards, the song won the award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. \"Since U Been Gone\" was covered by many artists, notably the American rock band A Day to Remember, indie rocker Ted Leo as well as the Canadian indie rock band, Tokyo Police Club, and used in the musical *& Juliet*.\n\n\n\n\n## Background and writing[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n140. **^** \"Top 50 Singles\".

As the song begins, you see Jazze Pha reciting the introduction, featuring Elliott, and then finally Ciara herself. We see Ciara and her dancers, dancing in the Atlanta dance studio, and certain shots of her teaching her female friend the \"1, 2 Step\". We then see a clip of Ciara meeting up with B5 and performing the \"1, 2 Step\". Later, Ciara is seen dancing alone on the streets. While dancing at the studio, she looks behind her, and sees Elliott in the mirror, says she is just looking things. Then Elliott begins to rap her verse and they continue dancing with each other in front of the mirror, until the songs ends. During this time, we also see shots of Ciara teaching a group of young girls the dance and also, she meets a boy who is standing in front of his house and kind of gives him a flirtatious look. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n65. **^** \"Gold-/Platin-Datenbank (Ciara feat.

The song was created on one of Jazze Pha's five Akai MPC3000s. Pha used laser pulses from E-mu Proteus in the 2000s that were used for old school hip hop songs and b-boy break dance tracks. \"1, 2 Step\" is inspired by Afrika Bambaataa's \"Planet Rock.\" Jazze Pha thought about how he could create a more melodic version and \"shared some interesting ideas on what kind of music he would like to produce with her. Let's put it this way, it would be epic.\"[3] \"1, 2 Step\" references her past song \"Goodies\" and \"We Will Rock You\" by Queen. Missy Elliott's verse was inspired by Teena Marie's song \"Square Biz\".[4]\n\n\n\n## Critical reception[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWe also see four skaters, three male, and one female skater, skating in the streets and a last shot of Ciara and her dancers.\n\n\n\n## Track listings[edit]\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **US 12-inch single**[25]\n\nA1. \"1, 2 Step\" (main) – 3:22\nA2. \"1, 2 Step\" (instrumental) – 3:22\nB1. \"1, 2 Step\" (main) – 3:22\nB2. \"1, 2 Step\" (acappella) – 3:14\n**UK CD1**[26]\n1. \"1, 2 Step\" (album version) – 3:22\n2. \"1, 2 Step\" (instrumental) – 3:22\n\n**UK CD2**[27]\n1. \"1, 2 Step\" (album version) – 3:22\n2. \"1, 2 Step\" (Delinquent \"Growing Pains\" remix) – 4:55\n3. \"1, 2 Step\" (Phatbelly club remix) – 3:30\n4. \"1, 2 Step\" (Eazy remix) – 5:16\n5. \"1, 2 Step\" (video)\n | **UK 12-inch single**[28]\n\nA1. \"1, 2 Step\" (album version) – 3:22\nA2. \"1, 2 Step\" (Phatbelly club remix) – 3:30\nB1. \"1, 2 Step\" (Delinquent \"Growing Pains\" remix) – 4:55\nB2. \"1, 2 Step\" (Eazy remix) – 5:16\n**European CD single**[29]\n1. \"1, 2 Step\" (album version) – 3:22\n2. \"1, 2 Step\" (Johnny Budz Mixshow edit) – 4:40\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nCiara\n |\n| --- |\n| * Discography\n* Videography\n* Awards and nominations\n |\n| *Goodies* | * \"Goodies\"\n* \"1, 2 Step\"\n* \"Oh\"\n* \"And I\"\n |\n| *Ciara: The Evolution* | * \"That's Right\"\n* \"Like a Boy\"\n* \"Promise\"\n* \"Can't Leave 'em Alone\"\n* \"Get Up\"\n |\n| *Fantasy Ride* | * \"Love Sex Magic\"\n* \"High Price\"\n* \"Like a Surgeon\"\n* \"Never Ever\"\n* \"Work\"\n* \"Go Girl\"\n |\n| *Basic Instinct* | * \"Ride\"\n* \"Gimmie Dat\"\n* \"Speechless\"\n |\n| *Ciara* | * \"I'm Out\"\n* \"Body Party\"\n* \"Read My Lips\"\n* \"Livin' It Up\"\n* \"Overdose\"\n |\n| *Jackie* | * \"Dance like We're Making Love\"\n* \"I Bet\"\n |\n| *Beauty Marks* | * \"Level Up\"\n* \"Thinkin Bout You\"\n* \"Dose\"\n* \"Greatest Love\"\n |\n| *CiCi* | * \"How We Roll\"\n |\n| Other singles | * \"Sorry\"\n* \"Got Me Good\"\n* \"Get Up\"\n* \"Jump\"\n* \"Better Thangs\"\n* \"Da Girls\"\n |\n| Featured singles | * \"Lose Control\"\n* \"Like You\"\n* \"So What\"\n* \"Promise Ring\"\n* \"Stepped on My J'z\"\n* \"Just Stand Up!\"\n* \"Takin' Back My Love\"\n |\n| Other songs | * \"Sweat\"\n* \"Paint It Black\"\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n\"1, 2 Step\" was nominated for the 2006 Grammy Award for \"Best Rap/Sung Collaboration,\" but lost to \"Numb/Encore\" by Jay-Z and Linkin Park.
