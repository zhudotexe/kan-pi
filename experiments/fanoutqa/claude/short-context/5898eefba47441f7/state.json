The combined area of these two districts is 18,200 square kilometres (7,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi),[8] which has been subtracted from Heilongjiang's reported area to arrive at the figure of 454,800 square kilometres (175,600\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) reported in the table and corroborated by ref. 6.\n2. **^** Figure is the sum of the areas of the listed administrative divisions, rounded to the nearest hundred square kilometres.

Religiously, the most Uyghur peoples of Xinjiang follow Islam; in the rest of China, many are Buddhist, Taoist and Confucian, although many follow Islam as well, such as the Hui ethnic subgroup of the Han ethnicity, comprising some 10 million people. Thus, the major difference and source of friction with eastern China is ethnicity and religious doctrinal differences that differentiate them politically from other Muslim minorities elsewhere in the country.[161]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Development of GDP\n |\n| --- |\n| Year\n | GDP in billions of Yuan\n |\n| 1995\n | 82\n |\n| 2000\n | 136\n |\n| 2005\n | 260\n |\n| 2010\n | 544\n |\n| 2015\n | 932\n |\n| 2020\n | 1,380\n |\n| Source:[163] |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Ethnic groups in Xinjiang\n |\n| --- |\n| 2020 Chinese census[235] |\n| Nationality | Population | Percentage\n |\n| Uyghur | 11,624,257 | 44.96 percent\n |\n| Han | 10,920,098 | 42.24 percent\n |\n| Kazakh | 1,539,636 | 5.96 percent\n |\n| Hui | 1,102,928 | 4.27 percent\n |\n| Kirghiz | 199,264 | 0.77 percent\n |\n| Mongols | 169,143 | 0.65 percent\n |\n| Dongxiang | 72,036 | 0.28 percent\n |\n| Tajiks | 50,238 | 0.19 percent\n |\n| Xibe | 34,105 | 0.13 percent\n |\n| Manchu | 20,915 | 0.080 percent\n |\n| Tujia | 15,787 | 0.086 percent\n |\n| Tibetan | 18,276 | 0.071 percent\n |\n| Uzbek | 12,301 | 0.048 percent\n |\n| Miao | 12,220 | 0.047 percent\n |\n| Russian | 8,024 | 0.031 percent\n |\n| Yi | 7,752 | 0.030 percent\n |\n| Zhuang | 5,727 | 0.022 percent\n |\n| Daur | 5,447 | 0.021 percent\n |\n| Tatar | 5,183 | 0.024 percent\n |\n| Tu | 3,827 | 0.015 percent\n |\n| Salar | 3,266 | 0.013 percent\n |\n| Other | 11,764 | 0.046 percent\n |\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** 6-1 \u81ea\u7136\u8d44\u6e90\u5212 [6-1 Natural Resources] (in Chinese).

With nine percent of Xinjiang's population, \u00dcr\u00fcmqi accounts for 25 percent of the region's GDP; many rural Uyghurs have migrated to the city for work in its light, heavy and petrochemical industries.[100] Han in Xinjiang are older, better-educated and work in higher-paying professions than their Uyghur counterparts. Han are more likely to cite business reasons for moving to \u00dcr\u00fcmqi, while some Uyghurs cite legal trouble at home and family reasons for moving to the city.[101] Han and Uyghurs are equally represented in \u00dcr\u00fcmqi's floating population, which works primarily in commerce. Auto-segregation in the city is widespread in residential concentration, employment relationships and endogamy.[102] In 2010, Uyghurs were a majority in the Tarim Basin and a plurality in Xinjiang as a whole.[103]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the late 19th century, it was still being proposed by some people that two separate regions be created out of Xinjiang, the area north of the Tianshan and the area south of the Tianshan, while it was being argued over whether to turn Xinjiang into a province.[40]\n\n\nXinjiang is a large, sparsely populated area, spanning over 1.6 million km2 (comparable in size to Iran), which takes up about one sixth of the country's territory.

Southern Xinjiang, with 95 percent non-Han population, has an average per capita income half that of Xinjiang as a whole.[6] XPCC plays an outsized role in Xinjiang's economy, with the organization producing CN\u00a5350 billion (US$52 billion), or around 19.7% of Xinjiang's economy, while the per capita GDP was CN\u00a598,748 (US$14,680).[165]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n161. ^ ***a*** ***b*** *Uyghur Muslim Ethnic Separatism in Xinjiang, China Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies Archived 15 December 2013 at the Wayback Machine*\n162. **^** Martina, Michael; Blanchard, Ben; Spring, Jake (20 July 2016).

With nine percent of Xinjiang's population, \u00dcr\u00fcmqi accounts for 25 percent of the region's GDP; many rural Uyghurs have migrated to the city for work in its light, heavy and petrochemical industries.[100] Han in Xinjiang are older, better-educated and work in higher-paying professions than their Uyghur counterparts. Han are more likely to cite business reasons for moving to \u00dcr\u00fcmqi, while some Uyghurs cite legal trouble at home and family reasons for moving to the city.[101] Han and Uyghurs are equally represented in \u00dcr\u00fcmqi's floating population, which works primarily in commerce. Auto-segregation in the city is widespread in residential concentration, employment relationships and endogamy.[102] In 2010, Uyghurs were a majority in the Tarim Basin and a plurality in Xinjiang as a whole.[103]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAccording to the Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies, the two main sources for separatism in the Xinjiang Province are religion and ethnicity. Religiously, the most Uyghur peoples of Xinjiang follow Islam; in the rest of China, many are Buddhist, Taoist and Confucian, although many follow Islam as well, such as the Hui ethnic subgroup of the Han ethnicity, comprising some 10 million people. Thus, the major difference and source of friction with eastern China is ethnicity and religious doctrinal differences that differentiate them politically from other Muslim minorities elsewhere in the country.[161]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Development of GDP\n |\n| --- |\n| Year\n | GDP in billions of Yuan\n |\n| 1995\n | 82\n |\n| 2000\n | 136\n |\n| 2005\n | 260\n |\n| 2010\n | 544\n |\n| 2015\n | 932\n |\n| 2020\n | 1,380\n |\n| Source:[163] |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n7. **^** \"Human Development Indices (5.0)- China\".

China's first border free trade zone (Horgos Free Trade Zone) was located at the Xinjiang-Kazakhstan border city of Horgos.[191] Horgos is the largest \"land port\" in China's western region and it has easy access to the Central Asian market. Xinjiang also opened its second border trade market to Kazakhstan in March 2006, the Jeminay Border Trade Zone.[192]\n\n\n\n### Economic and Technological Development Zones[edit]\n\n\n* Bole Border Economic Cooperation Area[193]\n* Shihezi Border Economic Cooperation Area[194]\n* Tacheng Border Economic Cooperation Area[195]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nEconomic development of Xinjiang is a priority for China.[166] In 2000, the government articulated its strategy for developing the western regions of the country, and that plan made Xinjiang a major focus.[166] Accelerating development in Xinjiang is intended by China to achieve a number of objectives, including narrowing the economic gap between Xinjiang and the more developed eastern provinces, as well as alleviating political discontent and security problems by alleviating poverty and raising the standard of living in order to increase stability.[166]\n\n\nIn July 2010, state media outlet *China Daily* reported that:\n\n\n\n\n> Local governments in China's 19 provinces and municipalities, including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangdong, Zhejiang and Liaoning, are engaged in the commitment of \"pairing assistance\" support projects in Xinjiang to promote the development of agriculture, industry, technology, education and health services in the region.[167]\n> \n> \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\u2610 **Disputed areas claimed by Indiaand administered by China(see Sino-Indian border dispute)**\n |\n| Division code[132] | Division\n | Area in km2[133] | Population 2020 (XPCC data from 2010)[134][135] | Seat\n | Divisions[136] |\n| Districts | Counties | Aut. counties | CL cities |\n| 650000 | Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region\n | 1,664,900.00 | 25,852,345 | \u00dcr\u00fcmqi city | 13 | 61 | 6 | 27\n |\n| 650100 | \u00dcr\u00fcmqi city\n | 13,787.90 | 4,054,369 | Tianshan District | 7 | 1 |  |  |\n| 650200 | Karamay city\n | 8,654.08 | 490,348 | Karamay District | 4 |  |  |  |\n| 650400 | Turpan city\n | 67,562.91 | 693,988 | Gaochang District | 1 | 2 |  |  |\n| 650500 | Hami city\n | 142,094.88 | 673,383 | Yizhou District | 1 |  | 1 | 1\n |\n| 652300 | Changji Hui Autonomous Prefecture | 73,139.75 | 1,613,585 | Changji city |  | 4 | 1 | 2\n |\n| 652700 | Bortala Mongol Autonomous Prefecture | 24,934.33 | 488,198 | Bole city |  | 2 |  | 2\n |\n| 652800 | Bayingolin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture | 470,954.25 | 1,613,979 | Korla city |  | 7 | 1 | 1\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 12 | Hotan | 119,804 | 322,300 | *part of Hotan Prefecture* | 2010-11-01\n |\n| 13 | Altay | 112,711 | 190,064 | *part of Altay Prefecture* | 2010-11-01\n |\n| 14 | Turpan[ii] | 89,719 | 273,385 | 622,903 | 2010-11-01\n |\n| 15 | Tacheng | 75,122 | 161,037 | *part of Tacheng Prefecture* | 2010-11-01\n |\n| 16 | Wujiaqu | 75,088 | 96,436 | 96,436 | 2010-11-01\n |\n| 17 | Fukang | 67,598 | 165,006 | *part of Changji Prefecture* | 2010-11-01\n |\n| 18 | Aral | 65,175 | 158,593 | 158,593 | 2010-11-01\n |\n| 19 | Artux | 58,427 | 240,368 | *part of Kizilsu Prefecture* | 2010-11-01\n |\n| (\u2013) | Beitun[iii] | 57,889 | 57,889 | 57,889 | 2010-11-01\n |\n| (\u2013) | Kokdala[iv] | 57,537 | 57,537 | 57,537 | 2010-11-01\n |\n| (\u2013) | Shuanghe[v] | 53,565 | 53,565 | 53,565 | 2010-11-01\n |\n| (\u2013) | Korgas[vi] | 51,462 | 51,462 | *part of Ili Prefecture* | 2010-11-01\n |\n| (\u2013) | Kunyu[vii] | 36,399 | 36,399 | 36,399 | 2010-11-01\n |\n| 20 | Tumxuk | 34,808 | 135,727 | 135,727 | 2010-11-01\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDue to water scarcity, most of Xinjiang's population lives within fairly narrow belts that are stretched along the foothills of the region's mountain ranges in areas conducive to irrigated agriculture.

Its per capita GDP was CN\u00a596,474 (US$14,343 in nominal), ranking 8th among all the 31 provincial divisions of China.[5] The primary, secondary and tertiary industries contributed \u00a5265 billion ($39.45 billion), \u00a51.12 trillion ($167.1 billion) and \u00a5926 billion ($137.7 billion) to the GDP respectively.[5]\n\n\nIn addition to its large reserves of natural resources, Inner Mongolia also has the largest usable wind power capacity in China[47] thanks to strong winds which develop in the province's grasslands. Some private companies have set up wind parks in parts of Inner Mongolia such as Bailingmiao, Hutengliang and Zhouzi.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nInner Mongolia has seen considerable development since Deng Xiaoping instituted Chinese economic reform in 1978. For about ten years since 2000, Inner Mongolia's GDP growth has been the highest in the country, (along with Guangdong) largely owing to the success of natural resource industries in the region. GDP growth has continually been over 10%, even 15% and connections with the Wolf Economy to the north has helped development. However, growth has come at a cost with huge amounts of pollution and degradation to the grasslands.[30] Attempts to attract ethnic Chinese to migrate from other regions, as well as urbanise those rural nomads and peasants has led to huge amounts of corruption and waste in public spending, such as Ordos City.[31][32] Acute uneven wealth distribution has further exacerbated ethnic tensions, many indigenous Mongolians feeling they are increasingly marginalised in their own homeland, leading to riots in 2011 and 2013.[33][34]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n|  Most populous cities in Inner MongoliaSource: *China Urban Construction Statistical Yearbook 2018* Urban Population and Urban Temporary Population[45]\n |\n| --- |\n|  | Rank\n |  | Municipal pop.\n | Rank\n |  | Municipal pop. |  |\n| ![Hohhot](image)Hohhot![Baotou](image)Baotou | 1 | Hohhot | 2,364,800 | 11 | Xilinhot | 233,700\n | ![Chifeng](image)Chifeng![Wuhai](image)Wuhai |\n| 2 | Baotou | 1,936,200 | 12 | Manzhouli | 212,200\n |\n| 3 | Chifeng | 963,000 | 13 | Fengzhen | 138,600\n |\n| 4 | Wuhai | 563,300 | 14 | Zalantun | 134,400\n |\n| 5 | Ordos | 530,400 | 15 | Yakeshi | 131,900\n |\n| 6 | Tongliao | 460,000 | 16 | Holingol | 130,700\n |\n| 7 | Bayannur | 383,500 | 17 | Erenhot | 75,200\n |\n| 8 | Hulunbuir | 350,400 | 18 | Genhe | 64,000\n |\n| 9 | Ulanqab | 309,600 | 19 | Arxan | 47,800\n |\n| 10 | Ulanhot | 272,500 | 20 | Ergun | 38,000\n |\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nInner Mongolia is one of the more economically developed provinces in China with annual GDP per capita at US$14,343 (2022), ranked 8th in the nation.

The region is also a source of crude oil, with sites such as the Xifeng oil field producing tens of thousands of barrels per day.[46] However, in the past, the exploitation and utilisation of resources were rather inefficient, which resulted in poor returns from rich resources. Inner Mongolia is also an important coal production base, with more than a quarter of the world's coal reserves located in the province.[47] It plans to double annual coal output by 2010 (from the 2005 volume of 260 million tons) to 500 million tons of coal a year.[48]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | 65,755.47 | 1,538,715 | Linhe District | 1 | 6 |  |  |\n| 150900 | Ulanqab city\n | 54,447.72 | 1,706,328 | Jining District | 1 | 9 |  | 1\n |\n| 152200 | Hinggan League | 59,806.00 | 1,416,929 | Ulanhot city |  | 4 |  | 2\n |\n| 152500 | Xilingol League | 202,580.00 | 1,107,075 | Xilinhot city |  | 10 |  | 2\n |\n| 152900 | Alxa League | 267,574.00 | 262,361 | Alxa Left Banner |  | 3 |  |  |\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTerritories with Mongol majorities and near-majorities[*citation needed*]\n| Name of banner | Mongol population | Percentage\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Horqin Right Middle Banner, Hinggan (2020)[68] | 221,258 | 86.6%\n |\n| New Barag Right Banner, Hulunbuir (2009) | 28,369 | 82.2%\n |\n| Horqin Left Back Banner, Tongliao | 284,000 | 75%\n |\n| New Barag Left Banner, Hulunbuir (2009) | 31,531 | 74.9%\n |\n| Horqin Left Middle Banner, Tongliao | 395,000 | 73.5%\n |\n| East Ujimqin Banner, Xilingol (2009) | 43,394 | 72.5%\n |\n| West Ujimqin Banner, Xilingol | 57,000 | 65%\n |\n| Sonid Left Banner, Xilingol (2006) | 20,987 | 62.6%\n |\n| Bordered Yellow Banner, Xilingol | 19,000 | 62%\n |\n| Hure Banner, Tongliao | 93,000 | 56%\n |\n| Jarud Banner, Tongliao | 144,000 | 48%\n |\n| Horqin Right Front Banner, Hinggan | 162,000 | 45%\n |\n| Old Barag Banner, Hulunbuir (2006) | 25,903 | 43.6%\n |\n| Jalaid Banner, Hinggan | 158,000 | 39%\n |\n| Ar Khorchin Banner, Chifeng (2002) | 108,000 | 36.6%\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHistorical population| Year | Pop. | \u00b1% p.a. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1954[52] | 6,100,104 | \u2014\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 |\n| 1964[53] | 12,348,638 | +7.31% |\n| 1982[54] | 19,274,279 | +2.50% |\n| 1990[55] | 21,456,798 | +1.35% |\n| 2000[56] | 23,323,347 | +0.84% |\n| 2010[57] | 24,706,321 | +0.58% |\n| 2020[58] | 24,049,155 | \u22120.27% |\n| Established in 1947 from dissolution of Xing'an Province, Qahar Province, parts of Rehe Province, and Suiyuan Province; parts of Ningxia Province were incorporated into Inner Mongolia AR. |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n58. **^** \"FACTBOX-Key takeaways from China's 2020 population census\". *Reuters*. 11 May 2021.\n59. **^** Myron Weiner, Sharon Stanton Russell(2001).

Southern Xinjiang, with 95 percent non-Han population, has an average per capita income half that of Xinjiang as a whole.[6] XPCC plays an outsized role in Xinjiang's economy, with the organization producing CN\u00a5350 billion (US$52 billion), or around 19.7% of Xinjiang's economy, while the per capita GDP was CN\u00a598,748 (US$14,680).[165]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n161. ^ ***a*** ***b*** *Uyghur Muslim Ethnic Separatism in Xinjiang, China Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies Archived 15 December 2013 at the Wayback Machine*\n162. **^** Martina, Michael; Blanchard, Ben; Spring, Jake (20 July 2016).

Religiously, the most Uyghur peoples of Xinjiang follow Islam; in the rest of China, many are Buddhist, Taoist and Confucian, although many follow Islam as well, such as the Hui ethnic subgroup of the Han ethnicity, comprising some 10 million people. Thus, the major difference and source of friction with eastern China is ethnicity and religious doctrinal differences that differentiate them politically from other Muslim minorities elsewhere in the country.[161]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Development of GDP\n |\n| --- |\n| Year\n | GDP in billions of Yuan\n |\n| 1995\n | 82\n |\n| 2000\n | 136\n |\n| 2005\n | 260\n |\n| 2010\n | 544\n |\n| 2015\n | 932\n |\n| 2020\n | 1,380\n |\n| Source:[163] |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n7. **^** \"Human Development Indices (5.0)- China\".

Han are more likely to cite business reasons for moving to \u00dcr\u00fcmqi, while some Uyghurs cite legal trouble at home and family reasons for moving to the city.[101] Han and Uyghurs are equally represented in \u00dcr\u00fcmqi's floating population, which works primarily in commerce.

Han Chinese predominate in the cities of Xining, Haidong, Delingha and Golmud, and elsewhere in the northeast. The Hui are concentrated in Xining, Haidong, Minhe County, Hualong County, and Datong County. The Tu people predominate in Huzhu County and the Salars in Xunhua County; Tibetans and Mongols are sparsely distributed across the rural western part of the province.[27] Of the Muslim ethnic groups in China, Qinghai has communities of Hui, Salar, Dongxiang, and Bao'an.[16] The Hui dominate the wholesale business in Qinghai.[49]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nReligion in Qinghai (2000s)\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n**Qinghai** (/t\u0283\u026a\u014b\u02c8ha\u026a/, *ching-HY*;[5] Chinese: \u9752\u6d77\u24d8; alternately romanized as Tsinghai or Chinghai)[6] is a landlocked province in the northwest of the People's Republic of China. It is the largest province of China by area and has the third smallest population. Its capital and largest city is Xining.\n\n\nQinghai borders Gansu on the northeast, Xinjiang on the northwest, Sichuan on the southeast and the Tibet Autonomous Region on the southwest. Qinghai province was established in 1928 during the period of the Republic of China, and until 1949 was ruled by Chinese Muslim warlords known as the Ma clique. The Chinese name \"Qinghai\" is after Qinghai Lake, the largest lake in China. The lake is known as Tso ngon in Tibetan, and as Kokonor Lake in English, derived from the Mongol Oirat name for Qinghai Lake. Both Tso ngon and Kokonor are names found in historic documents to describe the region.[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nXETDZ enjoys a convenient transportation system, connected by the Xining-Lanzhou expressway and running through by two main roads, the broadest in the city.

Religiously, the most Uyghur peoples of Xinjiang follow Islam; in the rest of China, many are Buddhist, Taoist and Confucian, although many follow Islam as well, such as the Hui ethnic subgroup of the Han ethnicity, comprising some 10 million people. Thus, the major difference and source of friction with eastern China is ethnicity and religious doctrinal differences that differentiate them politically from other Muslim minorities elsewhere in the country.[161]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Development of GDP\n |\n| --- |\n| Year\n | GDP in billions of Yuan\n |\n| 1995\n | 82\n |\n| 2000\n | 136\n |\n| 2005\n | 260\n |\n| 2010\n | 544\n |\n| 2015\n | 932\n |\n| 2020\n | 1,380\n |\n| Source:[163] |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n7. **^** \"Human Development Indices (5.0)- China\".

Han are more likely to cite business reasons for moving to \u00dcr\u00fcmqi, while some Uyghurs cite legal trouble at home and family reasons for moving to the city.[101] Han and Uyghurs are equally represented in \u00dcr\u00fcmqi's floating population, which works primarily in commerce.

Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping made a nine-day visit to Xinjiang in 1981 and described the region as \"unsteady\".[97] The Deng era reforms encouraged China's ethnic minorities, including Uyghurs, to establish small private companies for commodity transit, retail, and restaurants.[98] A brisk cross-border shuttle trade by Uyghurs further developed following the Soviet Union's perestroika.[98]\n\n\nIncreased ethnic contact and labor competition coincided with Uyghur terrorism since the 1990s, such as the 1997 \u00dcr\u00fcmqi bus bombings.[99]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n185. **^** Jinhui Duan; Shuying Wei; Ming Zeng; Yanfang Ju (1 January 2016). \"The Energy Industry in Xinjiang, China: Potential, Problems, and Solutions\".

The population overall growth rate was 1.09 percent, with 1.63 percent of birth rate and 0.54 percent mortality rate.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTrade with Central Asian countries is crucial to Xinjiang's economy.[190] Most of the overall import/export volume in Xinjiang was directed to and from Kazakhstan through Ala Pass. China's first border free trade zone (Horgos Free Trade Zone) was located at the Xinjiang-Kazakhstan border city of Horgos.[191] Horgos is the largest \"land port\" in China's western region and it has easy access to the Central Asian market. Xinjiang also opened its second border trade market to Kazakhstan in March 2006, the Jeminay Border Trade Zone.[192]\n\n\n\n### Economic and Technological Development Zones[edit]\n\n\n* Bole Border Economic Cooperation Area[193]\n* Shihezi Border Economic Cooperation Area[194]\n* Tacheng Border Economic Cooperation Area[195]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nZulfiya Abdiqadir, head of the Transport Department was quoted as saying that 24,800,000,000 RMB had been invested into Xinjiang's road network in 2010 alone and, by this time, the roads covered approximately 152,000\u00a0km (94,000\u00a0mi).[244]\n\n\n\n### Rail[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.
