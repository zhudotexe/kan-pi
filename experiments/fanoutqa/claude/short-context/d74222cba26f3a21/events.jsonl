Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, many former Warsaw Pact and post-Soviet states sought to join NATO. Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic became NATO members in 1999, amid much debate within NATO itself and Russian opposition. NATO then formalized the process of joining the organization with \"Membership Action Plans\", which aided the accession of seven Central and Eastern Europe countries shortly before the 2004 Istanbul summit: Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia. Two countries on the Adriatic Sea—Albania and Croatia—joined on 1 April 2009 before the 2009 Strasbourg–Kehl summit. The next member states to join NATO were Montenegro on 5 June 2017, and North Macedonia on 27 March 2020.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs NATO Secretary General Willy Claes noted, the 1995 study did not specify the \"who or when,\"[100] though it discussed how the then newly formed Partnership for Peace and North Atlantic Cooperation Council could assist in the enlargement process,[101] and noted that on-going territorial disputes could be an issue for whether a country was invited.[102] At the 1997 Madrid summit, the heads of state of NATO issued the \"Madrid Declaration on Euro-Atlantic Security and Cooperation\" which invited three Central European countries to join the alliance, out of the twelve that had at that point requested to join, laying out a path for others to follow.[98] The text of Article 10 was the origin for the April 1999 statement of a \"NATO open door policy\".[103]\n\n\n\n### Membership Action Plan[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n103. **^** \"NATO's Open Door Policy\" (PDF).

The process of joining the alliance is governed by Article 10 of the North Atlantic Treaty, which allows for the invitation of \"other European States\" only and by subsequent agreements. Countries wishing to join must meet certain requirements and complete a multi-step process involving political dialog and military integration. The accession process is overseen by the North Atlantic Council, NATO's governing body. NATO was formed in 1949 with twelve founding members and has added new members nine times. The first additions were Greece and Turkey in 1952. In May 1955, West Germany joined NATO, which was one of the conditions agreed to as part of the end of the country's occupation by France, the United Kingdom, and the United States, prompting the Soviet Union to form its own collective security alliance (commonly called the Warsaw Pact) later that month. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNATO Aspirant Countries[117]\n| Country[4] | Partnership for Peace[118] | Individualized Action Plan[119] | Intensified Dialogue\n | Membership Action Plan[120] | Application\n | Accession Protocol\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![Bosnia and Herzegovina](image) Bosnia and Herzegovina[121] | 2006–12 December 2006\n | 2008-01IPAP September 2008\n | 2008-04 April 2008[122] | 2010-04 December 2018[123][Note 2] |  |  |\n| ![Georgia (country)](image) Georgia[125] | 1994-03 March 1994\n | 2004–10IPAP October 2004\n | 2006–09 September 2006[126] |  |  |  |\n| ![Sweden](image) Sweden | 1994-05 May 1994\n | —\n | —\n | —\n | 18 May 2022[127] | 5 July 2022[3](29/31 ratified[128])\n |\n| ![Ukraine](image) Ukraine | 1994-02 February 1994\n | 2002–11 Action Plan November 2002[Note 3] | 2005-04 April 2005[130] | —[Note 4] | 30 September 2022[132] |  |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Harding, Luke; Koshiw, Isobel (30 September 2022). \"Ukraine applies for Nato membership after Russia annexes territory\". *The Guardian*.

As such, opposition to Soviet-style communism became a defining characteristic of the organization and the anti-communist governments of Greece, which had just fought a civil war against a pro-communist army, and Turkey, whose newly-elected Democrat Party were staunchly pro-American, came under internal and external pressure to join the alliance, which both did in February 1952.[7][8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMontenegro declared independence on 3 June 2006; the new country subsequently joined the Partnership for Peace program at the 2006 Riga summit and then applied for a Membership Action Plan on 5 November 2008,[67] which was granted in December 2009.[68] Montenegro also began full membership with the Adriatic Charter of NATO aspirants in May 2009.[69][70] NATO formally invited Montenegro to join the alliance on 2 December 2015,[71] with negotiations concluding in May 2016;[72] Montenegro joined NATO on 5 June 2017.[73]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* NATO open door policy\n* Enlargement of the European Union\n* Withdrawal from NATO\n* Partnership for Peace\n* Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council\n* Major non-NATO ally\n* List of countries in Europe by military expenditures\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nEnlargement of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\n |\n| --- |\n| * 1952 (Greece, Turkey)\n* 1955 (West Germany)\n* 1982 (Spain)\n* 1990 (German reunification)\n* 1999 (Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland)\n* 2004 (Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia)\n* 2009 (Albania, Croatia)\n* 2017 (Montenegro)\n* 2020 (North Macedonia)\n* 2023 (Finland)\n* 2024 (Sweden)\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn September 2006, Georgia became the second to be offered the Intensified Dialogue status, following a rapid change in foreign policy under President Mikhail Saakashvili[112] and what it perceived as a demonstration of military readiness during the 2006 Kodori crisis.[113] Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Serbia similarly received offers at the April 2008 Bucharest summit.[114] While its neighbors both requested and accepted the dialog program, Serbia's offer was presented to guarantee the possibility of future ties with the alliance.[115]\n\n\n\n## Current status[edit]\n\n\n![Map of Europe with countries in six different colors based on their affiliation with NATO](image)|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Members of NATO\nAccession protocol signed\nMembership Action Plan\n | Enhanced Opportunity Partner\nIndividual Partnership Action Plan\nPartnership for Peace[Note 1]\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_013iX7uzcX9qPoiZxAcumEQP","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

While the simple HDI remains useful, it stated that \"the IHDI is the actual level of human development (accounting for inequality), while the HDI can be viewed as an index of 'potential' human development (or the maximum level of HDI) that could be achieved if there were no inequality.\"[4]\n\n\nThe index is based on the human development approach, developed by Mahbub ul-Haq, anchored in Amartya Sen's work on human capabilities, and often framed in terms of whether people are able to \"be\" and \"do\" desirable things in life. Examples include – being: well fed, sheltered, and healthy; doing: work, education, voting, participating in community life. The freedom of choice is central – someone choosing to be hungry (e.g. when fasting for religious reasons) is quite different from someone who is hungry because they cannot afford to buy food, or because the country is in a famine.[5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2010, the UNDP reacted to the criticism and updated the thresholds to classify nations as low, medium, and high human development countries. In a comment to *The Economist* in early January 2011, the Human Development Report Office responded[18] to a 6 January 2011 article in the magazine[19] which discusses the Wolff *et al.* paper. The Human Development Report Office states that they undertook a systematic revision of the methods used for the calculation of the HDI, and that the new methodology directly addresses the critique by Wolff *et al.* in that it generates a system for continuously updating the human-development categories whenever formula or data revisions take place.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Developing country\n* Economic development\n* Ethics of care\n* Happiness economics\n* Human Development and Capability Association\n* Humanistic economics\n* International development\n* List of sovereign states by percentage of population living in poverty\n* List of countries by share of income of the richest one percent\n* Right to an adequate standard of living\n* Life satisfaction\n* Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** HDI not available before 2018 in latest report\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n14. ^ ***a*** ***b*** *Human Development Report 2021-22: Uncertain Times, Unsettled Lives: Shaping our Future in a Transforming World* (PDF).

The index considers the health, education, income and living conditions in a given country to provide a measure of human development which is comparable between countries and over time.[1][2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe HDI was first published in 1990 with the goal of being a more comprehensive measure of human development than purely economic measures such as gross domestic product. The index incorporates three dimensions of human development: a long and healthy life, knowledge, and decent living standards. Various indicators are used to quantify how countries perform on each dimension. The indicators used in the 2022 report were life expectancy at birth; expected years of schooling for children; mean years of schooling for adults; and gross national income per capita. The indicators are used to create a health index, an education index and an income index, each with a value between 0 and 1. The geometric mean of the three indices—that is, the cube root of the product of the indices—is the human development index. A value above 0.800 is classified as very high, between 0.700 and 0.799 as high, 0.550 to 0.699 as medium, and below 0.550 as low.[1][12][13]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n18. **^** \"Subnational Human Development Index (SHDI) Area Database – Somalia\".

Some scholars have criticized how the factors are weighed, in particular how an additional year of life expectancy is valued differently between countries;[4][5] and the limited factors it considers, noting the omission of factors such as the levels of distributional and gender inequality.[6] In response to the former, the UNDP introduced the inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI) in its 2010 report, and in response to the latter the Gender Development Index (GDI) was introduced in the 1995 report.[7][8] Others have criticized the perceived oversimplification of using a single number per country.[9][10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe data used to calculate HDI comes mostly from United Nations agencies and international institutions, such as United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, the World Bank, International Monetary Fund and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Rarely, when one of the indicators is missing, cross-country regression models are used. Due to improved data and methodology updates, HDI values are not comparable across human development reports; instead, each report recalculates the HDI for some previous years.[13][14]\n\n\n\n\n\nHDI dimensions and indicators[15]\n| Dimensions | Indicators | Dimension index | HDI\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Long and healthy life | Life expectancy at birth | Life expectancy index | Human Development Index\n |\n| Knowledge | Expected years of schoolingMean years of schooling | Education index\n |\n| A decent standard of living | GNI per capita (PPP $) | GNI index\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n12. **^** *Human Development Report 1990* (PDF).

The index incorporates three dimensions of human development: a long and healthy life, knowledge, and decent living standards. Various indicators are used to quantify how countries perform on each dimension. The indicators used in the 2022 report were life expectancy at birth; expected years of schooling for children; mean years of schooling for adults; and gross national income per capita. The indicators are used to create a health index, an education index and an income index, each with a value between 0 and 1. The geometric mean of the three indices—that is, the cube root of the product of the indices—is the human development index. A value above 0.800 is classified as very high, between 0.700 and 0.799 as high, 0.550 to 0.699 as medium, and below 0.550 as low.[1][12][13]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 189 | ![Increase](image) (2) | ![](image) Niger | 0.400 | ![Increase](image) 1.54% |\n| 190 | ![Decrease](image) (1) | ![](image) Chad | 0.394 | ![Increase](image) 0.77% |\n| 191 | ![Decrease](image) (3) | ![](image) South Sudan | 0.385 | ![Decrease](image) 1.00% |\n\n\n## Regions and groups[edit]\n\n\nThe Human Development Report also reports the HDI for various groups of countries. These include regional groupings based on the UNDP regional classifications,[21] HDI groups including the countries currently falling into a given HDI bracket, OECD members and various other UN groupings.[22] The aggregate HDI values are calculated in the same way as for individual countries with the input data being the weighted average for all countries with available data in the group.[23]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n18. **^** \"Subnational Human Development Index (SHDI) Area Database – Somalia\".

Some scholars have criticized how the factors are weighed, in particular how an additional year of life expectancy is valued differently between countries;[4][5] and the limited factors it considers, noting the omission of factors such as the levels of distributional and gender inequality.[6] In response to the former, the UNDP introduced the inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI) in its 2010 report, and in response to the latter the Gender Development Index (GDI) was introduced in the 1995 report.[7][8] Others have criticized the perceived oversimplification of using a single number per country.[9][10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n22. **^** \"Human Development Report 2020: Reader's Guide | Human Development Reports\". *hdr.undp.org*.

These include regional groupings based on the UNDP regional classifications,[21] HDI groups including the countries currently falling into a given HDI bracket, OECD members and various other UN groupings.[22] The aggregate HDI values are calculated in the same way as for individual countries with the input data being the weighted average for all countries with available data in the group.[23]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe HDI was first published in 1990 with the goal of being a more comprehensive measure of human development than purely economic measures such as gross domestic product. The index incorporates three dimensions of human development: a long and healthy life, knowledge, and decent living standards. Various indicators are used to quantify how countries perform on each dimension. The indicators used in the 2022 report were life expectancy at birth; expected years of schooling for children; mean years of schooling for adults; and gross national income per capita. The indicators are used to create a health index, an education index and an income index, each with a value between 0 and 1. The geometric mean of the three indices—that is, the cube root of the product of the indices—is the human development index. A value above 0.800 is classified as very high, between 0.700 and 0.799 as high, 0.550 to 0.699 as medium, and below 0.550 as low.[1][12][13]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCountries ranked from 1 to 66 in 2021 are designated \"very high\" HDI; those ranked from 67 to 115 are designated \"high\" HDI; those ranked from 116 to 159 are denoted \"medium\" HDI; and those ranked from 160 to 191 are designated \"low\" HDI.[19][13]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Human Development Index (HDI) | Human Development Reports\". *hdr.undp.org*.

Some scholars have criticized how the factors are weighed, in particular how an additional year of life expectancy is valued differently between countries;[4][5] and the limited factors it considers, noting the omission of factors such as the levels of distributional and gender inequality.[6] In response to the former, the UNDP introduced the inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI) in its 2010 report, and in response to the latter the Gender Development Index (GDI) was introduced in the 1995 report.[7][8] Others have criticized the perceived oversimplification of using a single number per country.[9][10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n22. **^** \"Human Development Report 2020: Reader's Guide | Human Development Reports\". *hdr.undp.org*.

It is a standard means of measuring well-being. It is used to distinguish whether the country is a developed, developing, or underdeveloped country, and also to measure the impact of economic policies on quality of life. Countries fall into four broad categories based on their HDI: very high, high, medium, and low human development.

culturally a European country.\n2. **^** The European portion of Turkey comprises 3% of the country, making it a transcontinental country.\n3. **^** Geographically, the majority of Russia lies in North Asia, but Russia is culturally and ethnically a part of Europe. European Russia is home to 78% of Russia's total population, but covers less than 25% of Russia's total land area.\n4. **^** Kazakhstan is mainly located in Central Asia with a small portion west of the Ural River located in Eastern Europe.\n5. **^** Generally, the Greater Caucasus separates Europe from Asia, putting Georgia mostly in Western Asia, and only a small part in Europe. Some other definitions place the whole Caucasus region, including Georgia, in Eastern Europe instead.\n6. **^** Armenia is sometimes considered a European country. Geographically, it is considered an Asian country. By physiographic criteria, Armenia integrates Asia, but the country has political, historical and cultural ties with Europe.\n7. **^** Geographically, Azerbaijan is located in the South Caucasus region of Eurasia, straddling Western Asia and Eastern Europe.\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n1. **^** \"Table 1: Human Development Index (HDI) and its components\".\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** *Human Development Report 2020 The Next Frontier: Human Development and the Anthropocene* (PDF).

It is a standard means of measuring well-being. It is used to distinguish whether the country is a developed, developing, or underdeveloped country, and also to measure the impact of economic policies on quality of life. Countries fall into four broad categories based on their HDI: very high, high, medium, and low human development. Currently, all European countries fall into the very high or high human development category.\n\n\n\n\n## List\n\n[edit]\n\nThe table below presents the latest Human Development Index (HDI)[1] for countries in Europe as included in a United Nations Development Programme's Human Development Report (released in 2020).[2][3] Previous HDI values and rankings are retroactively recalculated using the same updated data sets and current methodologies, as presented in Table 2 of the Statistical Annex of the Human Development Report.[4]\n\n\nCountries that are not entirely located in Europe are shown here in italics, but HDI figures are given for the whole country. Monaco and Vatican City are not ranked as they are not included in the latest report by the United Nations Development Programme.

culturally a European country.\n2. **^** The European portion of Turkey comprises 3% of the country, making it a transcontinental country.\n3. **^** Geographically, the majority of Russia lies in North Asia, but Russia is culturally and ethnically a part of Europe. European Russia is home to 78% of Russia's total population, but covers less than 25% of Russia's total land area.\n4. **^** Kazakhstan is mainly located in Central Asia with a small portion west of the Ural River located in Eastern Europe.\n5. **^** Generally, the Greater Caucasus separates Europe from Asia, putting Georgia mostly in Western Asia, and only a small part in Europe. Some other definitions place the whole Caucasus region, including Georgia, in Eastern Europe instead.\n6. **^** Armenia is sometimes considered a European country. Geographically, it is considered an Asian country. By physiographic criteria, Armenia integrates Asia, but the country has political, historical and cultural ties with Europe.\n7. **^** Geographically, Azerbaijan is located in the South Caucasus region of Eurasia, straddling Western Asia and Eastern Europe.\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n1. **^** \"Table 1: Human Development Index (HDI) and its components\".\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** *Human Development Report 2020 The Next Frontier: Human Development and the Anthropocene* (PDF).

The index considers the health, education, income and living conditions in a given country to provide a measure of human development which is comparable between countries and over time.[1][2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe HDI was first published in 1990 with the goal of being a more comprehensive measure of human development than purely economic measures such as gross domestic product. The index incorporates three dimensions of human development: a long and healthy life, knowledge, and decent living standards. Various indicators are used to quantify how countries perform on each dimension. The indicators used in the 2022 report were life expectancy at birth; expected years of schooling for children; mean years of schooling for adults; and gross national income per capita. The indicators are used to create a health index, an education index and an income index, each with a value between 0 and 1. The geometric mean of the three indices—that is, the cube root of the product of the indices—is the human development index. A value above 0.800 is classified as very high, between 0.700 and 0.799 as high, 0.550 to 0.699 as medium, and below 0.550 as low.[1][12][13]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n12. **^** *Human Development Report 1990* (PDF).

Some scholars have criticized how the factors are weighed, in particular how an additional year of life expectancy is valued differently between countries;[4][5] and the limited factors it considers, noting the omission of factors such as the levels of distributional and gender inequality.[6] In response to the former, the UNDP introduced the inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI) in its 2010 report, and in response to the latter the Gender Development Index (GDI) was introduced in the 1995 report.[7][8] Others have criticized the perceived oversimplification of using a single number per country.[9][10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTo reflect developmental differences within countries, a subnational HDI (SHDI) featuring data for more than 1,600 regions was introduced in 2018 by the Global Data Lab at Radboud University in the Netherlands.[10] In 2020, the UNDP introduced another index, the planetary pressures–adjusted Human Development Index (PHDI), which decreases the scores of countries with a higher ecological footprint.[11]\n\n\n\n\n## Dimensions and indicators[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n22. **^** \"Human Development Report 2020: Reader's Guide | Human Development Reports\". *hdr.undp.org*.

It is a standard means of measuring well-being. It is used to distinguish whether the country is a developed, developing, or underdeveloped country, and also to measure the impact of economic policies on quality of life. Countries fall into four broad categories based on their HDI: very high, high, medium, and low human development. Currently, all European countries fall into the very high or high human development category.\n\n\n\n\n## List\n\n[edit]\n\nThe table below presents the latest Human Development Index (HDI)[1] for countries in Europe as included in a United Nations Development Programme's Human Development Report (released in 2020).[2][3] Previous HDI values and rankings are retroactively recalculated using the same updated data sets and current methodologies, as presented in Table 2 of the Statistical Annex of the Human Development Report.[4]\n\n\nCountries that are not entirely located in Europe are shown here in italics, but HDI figures are given for the whole country.

culturally a European country.\n2. **^** The European portion of Turkey comprises 3% of the country, making it a transcontinental country.\n3. **^** Geographically, the majority of Russia lies in North Asia, but Russia is culturally and ethnically a part of Europe. European Russia is home to 78% of Russia's total population, but covers less than 25% of Russia's total land area.\n4. **^** Kazakhstan is mainly located in Central Asia with a small portion west of the Ural River located in Eastern Europe.\n5. **^** Generally, the Greater Caucasus separates Europe from Asia, putting Georgia mostly in Western Asia, and only a small part in Europe. Some other definitions place the whole Caucasus region, including Georgia, in Eastern Europe instead.\n6. **^** Armenia is sometimes considered a European country. Geographically, it is considered an Asian country. By physiographic criteria, Armenia integrates Asia, but the country has political, historical and cultural ties with Europe.\n7. **^** Geographically, Azerbaijan is located in the South Caucasus region of Eurasia, straddling Western Asia and Eastern Europe.\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n1. **^** \"Table 1: Human Development Index (HDI) and its components\".\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** *Human Development Report 2020 The Next Frontier: Human Development and the Anthropocene* (PDF).
