Though the 1983\u201384 season saw the Celtics win the title and the Sixers upset in the first round by the New Jersey Nets, the Sixers had a measure of satisfaction in the regular season by winning 4 of their 6 regular season games versus Boston, the only time the Sixers managed to win the regular season series versus Boston in the Larry Bird era. Charles Barkley joined the Sixers for the 1984\u201385 season, and the 1985 Eastern Final series was the Sixers' last conference final until 2001. In the 1985 Finals, they lost to Boston in five games after Boston had won the first 3 games, including a third game in Philadelphia where Julius Erving was uncharacteristically booed by the home crowd for his poor play. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe next season, both the Celtics and the Sixers finished with the best record in the NBA at 62\u201320, but Boston held the tiebreaker in the ranking. In a classic 7-game Eastern Finals, the Celtics beat the 76ers in 1981 4\u20133, coming all the way back from a 3\u20131 deficit to win the next 3 games in classic finishes. The Celtics won Games 5 and 6 by 2 points each and the seventh game by 1 point, 91\u201390, coming back from a 7-point deficit with a few minutes left to win on a Larry Bird banker from the left side with barely a minute left. The Celtics then defeated the Houston Rockets on their way to their first title in 5 years. For the 1981\u20131982 season, the Celtics again had the best record in the NBA at 63\u201319, followed by Philadelphia at 58\u201324, with one of the Sixers' key victories in the regular season being a win in Boston to snap the Celtics' 18-game winning streak. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Celtics and Sixers met in the Eastern Conference Finals that season with a trip to the NBA Finals on the line. The series went the distance, with Game 7 being held at the Boston Garden. With 5 seconds left and Boston leading 110\u2013109, Russell tried to inbound the ball when it hit a guy wire that supported the backboard, which resulted in a turnover. However, the Sixers failed to capitalize when Celtics forward John Havlicek deflected the inbound pass to Sam Jones, who ran out the clock. The Celtics advanced to the NBA Finals and defeated the Los Angeles Lakers in five games for their seventh straight title.[8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* **1969 Eastern Division Semifinals**: Celtics won, 4\u20131\n* **1977 Eastern Conference Semifinals**: 76ers won, 4\u20133\n* **1980 Eastern Conference Finals**: 76ers won, 4\u20131\n* **1981 Eastern Conference Finals**: Celtics won, 4\u20133\n* **1982 Eastern Conference Finals**: 76ers won, 4\u20133\n* **1985 Eastern Conference Finals**: Celtics won, 4\u20131\n* **2002 Eastern Conference First Round**: Celtics won, 3\u20132\n* **2012 Eastern Conference Semifinals**: Celtics won, 4\u20133\n* **2018 Eastern Conference Semifinals**: Celtics won, 4\u20131\n* **2020 Eastern Conference First Round**: Celtics won, 4\u20130\n* **2023 Eastern Conference Semifinals**: Celtics won, 4\u20133\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe two teams met again in the 2012 Eastern Conference Semifinals, which the Celtics won 4\u20133. The fourth-seeded Celtics defeated the eighth-seeded Sixers in a tight, back and forth series.\n\n\nThe teams met again in the 2018 Eastern Conference Semifinals as both team advanced from the first round lead by their new draft pick Jayson Tatum from Celtics with Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid from 76ers, respectively. The Celtics won 4\u20131, and Joel Embiid afterwards exclaimed \"This is not a rivalry, I don't know our record against them, but it's pretty bad. They always kick our ass.\"[15]\n\n\nThe teams met again in the first round of the 2020 NBA playoffs and the Celtics swept the series 4\u20130. This series took place in the 2020 NBA Bubble.[16]\n\n\nThe teams met again in the 2023 Eastern Conference Semifinals and, despite the 76ers being up 3-2 going into game 6, the Celtics managed to come back and won 4\u20133.[17]\n\n\n\n## The Boston Strangler[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the 1982 Eastern Finals, Boston attempted to come back from a similar 3\u20131 predicament and managed to extend the series to seven games, with the seventh game playing in raucous Boston Garden. However, Philadelphia had the last laugh, winning Game 7. In that finale, as Boston fans saw their team losing, in a show of respect, they congratulated the Sixers by shouting the now-famous \"Beat L.A.\" chant as the Sixers were about to face the well-rested Lakers.[9][10] In the end, however, the weary Sixers couldn't keep up, losing to the Lakers in the Finals.\n\n\nThe next season, the Sixers picked up MVP Moses Malone from the Houston Rockets. Malone repeated as the MVP and led the 76ers to an NBA Championship in a 4-game sweep against the Lakers. With the Bucks sweeping Boston, it made the Sixers' title run much easier.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n13. **^** Thomas, Mike (2020-07-05). \"Larry Bird's Heated Brawl with Julius Erving in 1984 Began Innocently Enough\". *Sportscasting | Pure Sports*.

Bird and the Celtics would win one more championship in 1986, but the Sixers would not reach another conference finals until 2001. The Sixers saw a steep decline through the rest of the '80's, trading Malone and Cheeks along with the retirements of Erving and Toney. Charles Barkley emerged as the Sixers new leader and a prominent NBA superstar, however he was not able to get the team past the second round. Though considered an MVP candidate in his prime, the Sixers traded him in 1992 and went through a period of rebuilding.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBoston Celtics\n |\n| First meeting | November 30, 1949Nationals 87, Celtics 71 |\n| Latest meeting | November 15, 202376ers 107, Celtics 117 |\n| Next meeting | December 1, 2023 |\n| Statistics |\n| Meetings total | 581 |\n| All-time series | 334\u2013247 (BOS) |\n| Regular season series | 268\u2013197 (BOS) |\n| Postseason results | 66\u201350 (BOS) |\n| Longest win streak | BOS W20 |\n| Current win streak | BOS W1 |\n| Postseason history |\n| * **1953 Eastern Division Semifinals**: Celtics won, 2\u20130\n* **1954 Eastern Division Finals**: Nationals won, 2\u20130\n* **1955 Eastern Division Finals**: Nationals won, 3\u20131\n* **1956 Eastern Division Semifinals**: Nationals won, 2\u20131\n* **1957 Eastern Division Finals**: Celtics won, 3\u20130\n* **1959 Eastern Division Finals**: Celtics won, 4\u20133\n* **1961 Eastern Division Finals**: Celtics won, 4\u20131\n* **1965 Eastern Division Finals**: Celtics won, 4\u20133\n* **1966 Eastern Division Finals**: Celtics won, 4\u20131\n* **1967 Eastern Division Finals**: 76ers won, 4\u20131\n* **1968 Eastern Division Finals**: Celtics won, 4\u20133\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Wilt Chamberlain being defended by Bill Russell.\nThe **76ers\u2013Celtics rivalry** is a National Basketball Association (NBA) rivalry between the Philadelphia 76ers and the Boston Celtics. The two teams have the most meetings in the NBA playoffs, playing each other in 22 series (and the 1954 Eastern Division Round Robin), with the Celtics winning 15 of them.[1] The 76ers are considered to be the Celtics' second biggest rival, behind only the Los Angeles Lakers.[2][3][4][5][6][7]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Celtics\u2013Nationals rivalry[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

Hannum had also coached the Bob Pettit-led St. Louis Hawks to the 1958 NBA Championship-the last year someone had defeated the Celtics in the championship. The Sixers went a then-NBA record 68-13 while the Celtics were 60\u201321. In the Eastern Conference Finals, the Sixers overpowered Boston, beating them in five games and ending Boston's eight-year reign as NBA champions. The Sixers won the NBA Championship by beating the San Francisco Warriors in six games, giving the Sixers and Chamberlain their first title. The 1966-67 76ers were voted in 1980 as being the greatest team in the history of the NBA to that point.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1968, the Sixers finished 62\u201320, eight games above Boston, and Chamberlain won his third consecutive MVP award. Both teams met in the Conference Championship again, and the Celtics won the Series in seven games after trailing 3\u20131, and went on to win the 1968 NBA Championship. After the season, 76ers head coach Alex Hannum left the NBA for the ABA in order to move closer to his family on the West Coast, and Chamberlain requested a trade, and was traded to Los Angeles.\n\n\nWithout Wilt, the Sixers managed a 55\u201327 record. Though Philadelphia again won the regular-season series against the Celtics, they were no match for Boston in the playoffs and lost 4\u20131. The Celtics went on to win the championship, their 11th in 13 seasons. After this season, Russell retired and both teams would not meet in the playoffs until 1977. The only two years Russell's Celtics did not win the championship, they lost to teams coached by Alex Hannum.\n\n\n\n### Dr. J and Bird[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter winning the championship in 1986, the Celtics also began a decline that started with tragedy. Two days after they drafted him in the 1986 draft, Len Bias died of a drug overdose. Reggie Lewis died of a heart attack in his prime in 1993. The Celtics then missed the playoffs in 1994, and did not post a winning record until the 2001\u201302 season.\n\n\nDespite the 90's being a period of stagnation for both teams, it did produce some key developments. Allen Iverson was drafted by the 76ers as the first overall pick in the 1996 draft, and the Celtics would draft Paul Pierce two years later. Both players would become superstars in the league and lead their respective team into the playoffs numerous times.\n\n\nIn 2002, the Celtics, in their first appearance since 1995, won the first round meeting 3\u20132 over the defending conference champion 76ers. That series featured the scoring exploits of Allen Iverson and Paul Pierce.[14]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n9. **^** Viser, Matt (June 1, 2008). \"Region revs up for an East-West rivalry reborn\". *Boston Globe*. p.\u00a0A1.

The Nationals beat the Celtics in three straight playoff series in 1954, 1955, and 1956, winning the NBA Championship in 1955. After the 1956 season the Celtics traded for Bill Russell and drafted K.C. Jones, both of whom starred and won Championships at the University of San Francisco. Also adding Tom Heinsohn with a territorial pick, the Celtics would win their next three playoff series against the Nationals in the playoffs (1957, 1959, and 1961) before the Nationals were sold and moved to Philadelphia.\n\n\n\n### Chamberlain and Russell[edit]\n\n\nIn 1963, the Syracuse Nationals moved to Philadelphia and became the 76ers, renewing the basketball rivalry between Philadelphia and Boston (from when the Warriors had been in Philadelphia). Shortly after the All-Star break in 1965, the Sixers acquired Wilt Chamberlain from the Warriors, bringing the Chamberlain/Russell matchup back into the rivalry as well.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Sixers slumped until acquiring Julius Erving before the 1977 season. They became a contender in the East, and in Erving's first season with the team, the Sixers eliminated the defending champion Boston Celtics in a tough seven-game Eastern semifinals in 1977. Boston slumped for the next two seasons while Philadelphia continued to be a strong team in the NBA, but in 1978, the Celtics drafted Indiana State forward Larry Bird in the hope of reviving their glory years as a franchise. Bird joined the team for the 1980 season and his impact was immediate. The Celtics improved from a 29\u201353 record in the 1978\u201379 season to a league-best 61\u201321 record in 1979\u20131980, advancing to the Eastern Conference Finals that season to face the Sixers.

Though the 1983\u201384 season saw the Celtics win the title and the Sixers upset in the first round by the New Jersey Nets, the Sixers had a measure of satisfaction in the regular season by winning 4 of their 6 regular season games versus Boston, the only time the Sixers managed to win the regular season series versus Boston in the Larry Bird era. Charles Barkley joined the Sixers for the 1984\u201385 season, and the 1985 Eastern Final series was the Sixers' last conference final until 2001. In the 1985 Finals, they lost to Boston in five games after Boston had won the first 3 games, including a third game in Philadelphia where Julius Erving was uncharacteristically booed by the home crowd for his poor play. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* **1969 Eastern Division Semifinals**: Celtics won, 4\u20131\n* **1977 Eastern Conference Semifinals**: 76ers won, 4\u20133\n* **1980 Eastern Conference Finals**: 76ers won, 4\u20131\n* **1981 Eastern Conference Finals**: Celtics won, 4\u20133\n* **1982 Eastern Conference Finals**: 76ers won, 4\u20133\n* **1985 Eastern Conference Finals**: Celtics won, 4\u20131\n* **2002 Eastern Conference First Round**: Celtics won, 3\u20132\n* **2012 Eastern Conference Semifinals**: Celtics won, 4\u20133\n* **2018 Eastern Conference Semifinals**: Celtics won, 4\u20131\n* **2020 Eastern Conference First Round**: Celtics won, 4\u20130\n* **2023 Eastern Conference Semifinals**: Celtics won, 4\u20133\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe two teams met again in the 2012 Eastern Conference Semifinals, which the Celtics won 4\u20133. The fourth-seeded Celtics defeated the eighth-seeded Sixers in a tight, back and forth series.\n\n\nThe teams met again in the 2018 Eastern Conference Semifinals as both team advanced from the first round lead by their new draft pick Jayson Tatum from Celtics with Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid from 76ers, respectively. The Celtics won 4\u20131, and Joel Embiid afterwards exclaimed \"This is not a rivalry, I don't know our record against them, but it's pretty bad. They always kick our ass.\"[15]\n\n\nThe teams met again in the first round of the 2020 NBA playoffs and the Celtics swept the series 4\u20130. This series took place in the 2020 NBA Bubble.[16]\n\n\nThe teams met again in the 2023 Eastern Conference Semifinals and, despite the 76ers being up 3-2 going into game 6, the Celtics managed to come back and won 4\u20133.[17]\n\n\n\n## The Boston Strangler[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Celtics and Sixers met in the Eastern Conference Finals that season with a trip to the NBA Finals on the line. The series went the distance, with Game 7 being held at the Boston Garden. With 5 seconds left and Boston leading 110\u2013109, Russell tried to inbound the ball when it hit a guy wire that supported the backboard, which resulted in a turnover. However, the Sixers failed to capitalize when Celtics forward John Havlicek deflected the inbound pass to Sam Jones, who ran out the clock. The Celtics advanced to the NBA Finals and defeated the Los Angeles Lakers in five games for their seventh straight title.[8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe next season, both the Celtics and the Sixers finished with the best record in the NBA at 62\u201320, but Boston held the tiebreaker in the ranking. In a classic 7-game Eastern Finals, the Celtics beat the 76ers in 1981 4\u20133, coming all the way back from a 3\u20131 deficit to win the next 3 games in classic finishes. The Celtics won Games 5 and 6 by 2 points each and the seventh game by 1 point, 91\u201390, coming back from a 7-point deficit with a few minutes left to win on a Larry Bird banker from the left side with barely a minute left. The Celtics then defeated the Houston Rockets on their way to their first title in 5 years. For the 1981\u20131982 season, the Celtics again had the best record in the NBA at 63\u201319, followed by Philadelphia at 58\u201324, with one of the Sixers' key victories in the regular season being a win in Boston to snap the Celtics' 18-game winning streak. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the 1982 Eastern Finals, Boston attempted to come back from a similar 3\u20131 predicament and managed to extend the series to seven games, with the seventh game playing in raucous Boston Garden. However, Philadelphia had the last laugh, winning Game 7. In that finale, as Boston fans saw their team losing, in a show of respect, they congratulated the Sixers by shouting the now-famous \"Beat L.A.\" chant as the Sixers were about to face the well-rested Lakers.[9][10] In the end, however, the weary Sixers couldn't keep up, losing to the Lakers in the Finals.\n\n\nThe next season, the Sixers picked up MVP Moses Malone from the Houston Rockets. Malone repeated as the MVP and led the 76ers to an NBA Championship in a 4-game sweep against the Lakers. With the Bucks sweeping Boston, it made the Sixers' title run much easier.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n13. **^** Thomas, Mike (2020-07-05). \"Larry Bird's Heated Brawl with Julius Erving in 1984 Began Innocently Enough\". *Sportscasting | Pure Sports*.

Bird and the Celtics would win one more championship in 1986, but the Sixers would not reach another conference finals until 2001. The Sixers saw a steep decline through the rest of the '80's, trading Malone and Cheeks along with the retirements of Erving and Toney. Charles Barkley emerged as the Sixers new leader and a prominent NBA superstar, however he was not able to get the team past the second round. Though considered an MVP candidate in his prime, the Sixers traded him in 1992 and went through a period of rebuilding.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNational Basketball Association rivalry\n\n\n\n76ers\u2013Celtics rivalry| ![](image)\n\nPhiladelphia 76ers\n![](image)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Wilt Chamberlain being defended by Bill Russell.\nThe **76ers\u2013Celtics rivalry** is a National Basketball Association (NBA) rivalry between the Philadelphia 76ers and the Boston Celtics. The two teams have the most meetings in the NBA playoffs, playing each other in 22 series (and the 1954 Eastern Division Round Robin), with the Celtics winning 15 of them.[1] The 76ers are considered to be the Celtics' second biggest rival, behind only the Los Angeles Lakers.[2][3][4][5][6][7]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Celtics\u2013Nationals rivalry[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

Two days after they drafted him in the 1986 draft, Len Bias died of a drug overdose. Reggie Lewis died of a heart attack in his prime in 1993. The Celtics then missed the playoffs in 1994, and did not post a winning record until the 2001\u201302 season.\n\n\nDespite the 90's being a period of stagnation for both teams, it did produce some key developments. Allen Iverson was drafted by the 76ers as the first overall pick in the 1996 draft, and the Celtics would draft Paul Pierce two years later. Both players would become superstars in the league and lead their respective team into the playoffs numerous times.\n\n\nIn 2002, the Celtics, in their first appearance since 1995, won the first round meeting 3\u20132 over the defending conference champion 76ers. That series featured the scoring exploits of Allen Iverson and Paul Pierce.[14]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n9. **^** Viser, Matt (June 1, 2008). \"Region revs up for an East-West rivalry reborn\". *Boston Globe*. p.\u00a0A1.

Hannum had also coached the Bob Pettit-led St. Louis Hawks to the 1958 NBA Championship-the last year someone had defeated the Celtics in the championship. The Sixers went a then-NBA record 68-13 while the Celtics were 60\u201321. In the Eastern Conference Finals, the Sixers overpowered Boston, beating them in five games and ending Boston's eight-year reign as NBA champions. The Sixers won the NBA Championship by beating the San Francisco Warriors in six games, giving the Sixers and Chamberlain their first title. The 1966-67 76ers were voted in 1980 as being the greatest team in the history of the NBA to that point.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1968, the Sixers finished 62\u201320, eight games above Boston, and Chamberlain won his third consecutive MVP award. Both teams met in the Conference Championship again, and the Celtics won the Series in seven games after trailing 3\u20131, and went on to win the 1968 NBA Championship. After the season, 76ers head coach Alex Hannum left the NBA for the ABA in order to move closer to his family on the West Coast, and Chamberlain requested a trade, and was traded to Los Angeles.\n\n\nWithout Wilt, the Sixers managed a 55\u201327 record. Though Philadelphia again won the regular-season series against the Celtics, they were no match for Boston in the playoffs and lost 4\u20131. The Celtics went on to win the championship, their 11th in 13 seasons. After this season, Russell retired and both teams would not meet in the playoffs until 1977. The only two years Russell's Celtics did not win the championship, they lost to teams coached by Alex Hannum.\n\n\n\n### Dr. J and Bird[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Sixers slumped until acquiring Julius Erving before the 1977 season. They became a contender in the East, and in Erving's first season with the team, the Sixers eliminated the defending champion Boston Celtics in a tough seven-game Eastern semifinals in 1977. Boston slumped for the next two seasons while Philadelphia continued to be a strong team in the NBA, but in 1978, the Celtics drafted Indiana State forward Larry Bird in the hope of reviving their glory years as a franchise. Bird joined the team for the 1980 season and his impact was immediate. The Celtics improved from a 29\u201353 record in the 1978\u201379 season to a league-best 61\u201321 record in 1979\u20131980, advancing to the Eastern Conference Finals that season to face the Sixers. The Sixers beat Boston in 5 but failed to win the title against the Lakers.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Syracuse Nationals and Boston Celtics played in the Eastern Division in the 1950s. The Nationals beat the Celtics in three straight playoff series in 1954, 1955, and 1956, winning the NBA Championship in 1955. After the 1956 season the Celtics traded for Bill Russell and drafted K.C. Jones, both of whom starred and won Championships at the University of San Francisco. Also adding Tom Heinsohn with a territorial pick, the Celtics would win their next three playoff series against the Nationals in the playoffs (1957, 1959, and 1961) before the Nationals were sold and moved to Philadelphia.\n\n\n\n### Chamberlain and Russell[edit]\n\n\nIn 1963, the Syracuse Nationals moved to Philadelphia and became the 76ers, renewing the basketball rivalry between Philadelphia and Boston (from when the Warriors had been in Philadelphia). Shortly after the All-Star break in 1965, the Sixers acquired Wilt Chamberlain from the Warriors, bringing the Chamberlain/Russell matchup back into the rivalry as well.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* *Lakers versus Celtics and the NBA Playoffs*\n* Mike Gorman\n* Johnny Most\n* \"Havlicek stole the ball\"\n* 1961 Boston Celtics boycott\n* The Auerbach Center\n* North Station\n* The Sports Museum of New England\n* Reebok Pro Summer League\n* *Newhart*\n* *Uncut Gems*\n* *Extended Family*\n |\n| * ![](image) Category\n* ![](image) Commons\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nNational Basketball Association rivalries\n |\n| --- |\n| EasternConference | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Atlantic | * 76ers\u2013Celtics\n* Celtics\u2013Knicks\n* Knicks\u2013Nets\n* Nets\u2013Raptors\n |\n| Central | * Bulls\u2013Cavaliers\n* Bulls\u2013Pistons\n |\n| Southeast | * Heat\u2013Magic\n |\n| Interdivisional | * Bulls\u2013Knicks\n* Celtics\u2013Heat\n* Celtics\u2013Pistons\n* Heat\u2013Knicks\n* Heat\u2013Pacers\n* Knicks\u2013Pacers\n |\n\n |\n| WesternConference | \n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Game 5 saw Brandon Bass score 27 points, including 18 in the third quarter as the Celtics blew out the Sixers, 101\u201385, to push them a win away from the Eastern Conference Finals. Before the start of Game 6, Allen Iverson presented the game ball, prompting huge cheers from the crowd. It was enough to motivate the Sixers to defeat the Celtics 82\u201375 to force a Game 7. Jrue Holiday scored 20 points, including two free-throws with 31 seconds to go to put the game away. Game 7 was a tight contest, with the two teams going back-and-forth. Paul Pierce fouled out late in the fourth quarter, but Rondo had his second triple-double of the series, including a fourth quarter that helped the Celtics advance to the Conference Finals to face the Miami Heat.\n\n\nThis series is an important plot point in the 2019 film *Uncut Gems*, in which Garnett co-stars.[20]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nRegular-season series\n\n\n| Philadelphia won 2\u20131 in the regular-season series\n |\n| --- |\n| |  |\n| --- |\n| March 7, 2012\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Recap\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Boston Celtics 71, **Philadelphia 76ers** **103** |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Wells Fargo Center, Philadelphia\n |\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| March 23, 2012\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Recap\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Boston Celtics 86, **Philadelphia 76ers** **99** |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Wells Fargo Center, Philadelphia\n |\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| April 8, 2012\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Recap\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Philadelphia 76ers 79, **Boston Celtics** **103** |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| TD Garden, Boston\n |\n |\n\n\nThis was the 20th playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Celtics winning 11 of the first 19 meetings.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious playoff series[21]\n| Boston leads 11\u20138 in all-time playoff series\n |\n| --- |\n| |  |\n| --- |\n| 1953\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Boston Celtics** 2, Syracuse Nationals 0\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 1953 Eastern Division Semifinals\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWith their Game 7 win over the Philadelphia 76ers, the Boston Celtics returned to the Conference Finals for the third time in five seasons. With the loss, the Philadelphia 76ers suffered the same fate as last season\u2019s Memphis Grizzlies by beating a top seed, taking their fourth seed opponent to a Game 7, only to lose on the road. The 76ers would not return to the playoffs until 2018.\n\n\n\n### Conference finals\n\n[edit]\n\nFor the third consecutive season, the Miami Heat and the Boston Celtics met in the postseason.\n\n\nWith their Game 2 win over the Oklahoma City Thunder, the San Antonio Spurs won 20 straight games. As a result, they set an NBA record for the longest winning streak carried over from the regular season to the playoffs, which was broken with the Game 3 loss, and finished a win short of tying the longest unbeaten playoff run in a single postseason.[1]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Sixers came off fresh of an upset over the injury-laden Bulls. Both the Celtics and the Sixers clinched their first round series on the same day. In Game 1, Rondo had another triple-double, but the Sixers held a 10-point lead with 10:53 left in the fourth quarter. However, the Celtics eventually came back, winning Game 1 by a point to take a 1\u20130 series lead. On the final possession, the Sixers were unable to foul a speedy Rondo, who dribbled out the clock. Game 2 saw the visitors lead for most of the game. With the Sixers leading 78\u201375 with 12 seconds to go, the Celtics squandered a chance to tie the game, as Garnett was called for an offensive foul. The Sixers then hit their final four free-throws to tie the series at 1 going back to Philadelphia. In Game 3, the Sixers held their last lead with 9:09 left in the second quarter as the Celtics took over the rest of the game to lead them to a 2\u20131 series advantage. In Game 4, the Celtics led by as much as 18 in the third quarter. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Boston Celtics** 4, Syracuse Nationals 1\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 1961 Eastern Division Finals\n |\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 1965\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Boston Celtics** 4, Philadelphia 76ers 3\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 1965 Eastern Division Finals\n |\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 1966\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Boston Celtics** 4, Philadelphia 76ers 1\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 1966 Eastern Division Finals\n |\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 1967\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Boston Celtics 1, **Philadelphia 76ers** 4\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 1967 Eastern Division Finals\n |\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 1968\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Boston Celtics** 4, Philadelphia 76ers 3\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 1968 Eastern Division Finals\n |\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 1969\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Boston Celtics** 4, Philadelphia 76ers 1\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 1969 Eastern Division Semifinals\n |\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 1977\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPrevious playoff series[19]\n| Indiana leads 1\u20130 in all-time playoff series\n |\n| --- |\n| |  |\n| --- |\n| 2004\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Indiana Pacers** 4, Miami Heat 2\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 2004 Eastern Conference Semifinals\n |\n |\n\n\n#### (5) Boston Celtics vs. (8) Philadelphia 76ers\n\n[edit]\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| TNT\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| May 12 8:00 pm\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Recap\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Philadelphia 76ers 91, **Boston Celtics** **92** |\n| **Scoring by quarter:** **28**\u201318, 19\u2013**24**, 24\u2013**25**, 20\u2013**25** |\n| **Pts:** Andre Iguodala 19**Rebs:** Evan Turner 10**Asts:** Andre Iguodala 6 |  | **Pts:** Kevin Garnett 29**Rebs:** Rajon Rondo 12**Asts:** Rajon Rondo 17 |\n| ***Boston leads series, 1\u20130*** |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| TD Garden, Boston**Attendance:** 18,624**Referees:** Greg Willard, James Capers, David Jones,\n |\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| TNT\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| May 14 7:00 pm\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Recap\n |\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |\n| --- |\n| April 1, 2012\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Recap\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Miami Heat 72, **Boston Celtics** **91** |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| TD Garden, Boston\n |\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| April 10, 2012\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Recap\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Boston Celtics** **115**, Miami Heat 107\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| American Airlines Arena, Miami\n |\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| April 24, 2012\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Recap\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Miami Heat 66, **Boston Celtics** **78** |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| TD Garden, Boston\n |\n |\n\n\nThis was the third playoff meeting between these two teams, with each team winning one series apiece.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious playoff series[24]\n| Tied 1\u20131 in all-time playoff series\n |\n| --- |\n| |  |\n| --- |\n| 2010\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Boston Celtics** 4, Miami Heat 1\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 2010 Eastern Conference First Round\n |\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 2011\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Boston Celtics 1, **Miami Heat** 4\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 2011 Eastern Conference Semifinals\n |\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHe made his second to cut it to one and the Hawks quickly fouled Paul Pierce.

In the second quarter, Garnett picked up his third foul, giving the Heat a chance to try and take a lead. However, Bass led a run that pushed the Celtics' lead to 11. The Celtics would still have a 7-point lead at halftime. The third quarter was decisive once again, letting the Heat tie the game going to the fourth quarter, which was even more decisive. With the Celtics leading by 1 with 8 minutes left, James had a dunk that gave the Heat the lead. It was soon followed by Bosh's third three-pointer of the night (a career-high three 3 pointers) that gave the Heat the lead for good. The Celtics never recovered as the Heat booked a return trip to the Finals with a 101\u201388 Game 7 win in Miami.\n\n\n\nRegular-season series\n\n\n| Boston won 3\u20131 in the regular-season series\n |\n| --- |\n| |  |\n| --- |\n| December 27, 2011\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Recap\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Boston Celtics 107, **Miami Heat** **115** |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| American Airlines Arena, Miami\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPrevious playoff series[9]\n| Boston leads 9\u20131 in all-time playoff series\n |\n| --- |\n| |  |\n| --- |\n| 1957\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Boston Celtics** 4, St. Louis Hawks 3\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 1957 NBA Finals\n |\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 1958\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Boston Celtics 2, **St. Louis Hawks** 4\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 1958 NBA Finals\n |\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 1960\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Boston Celtics** 4, St. Louis Hawks 3\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 1960 NBA Finals\n |\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 1961\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Boston Celtics** 4, St. Louis Hawks 1\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 1961 NBA Finals\n |\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 1972\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Atlanta Hawks 2, **Boston Celtics** 4\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 1972 Eastern Conference Semifinals\n |\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 1973\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Atlanta Hawks 2, **Boston Celtics** 4\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 1973 Eastern Conference Semifinals\n |\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 1983\n |\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| TD Garden, Boston**Attendance:** 18,624**Referees:** Ken Mauer, Ed Malloy, Rodney Mott,\n |\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ESPN\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| May 23 8:00 pm\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Recap\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Boston Celtics 75, **Philadelphia 76ers** **82** |\n| **Scoring by quarter:** 19\u2013**22**, **17**\u201311, 20\u2013**27**, 19\u2013**22** |\n| **Pts:** Paul Pierce 24**Rebs:** Kevin Garnett 11**Asts:** Rajon Rondo 6 |  | **Pts:** Jrue Holiday 20**Rebs:** Elton Brand 10**Asts:** Holiday, Williams 6 each |\n| ***Series tied, 3\u20133*** |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Wells Fargo Center, Philadelphia**Attendance:** 20,403**Referees:** Joe Crawford, James Capers, Ron Garretson,\n |\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ABC\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| May 26 8:00 pm\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Recap\n |\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n15. **^** \"Pau Gasol-led Lakers top Nuggets in Game 7; Metta World Peace adds 15 points in return\". *ESPN.com*.

Boston led the majority of the game thanks to a 14\u20134 run to start the game, with six Celtics players scoring in double figures. Although Philadelphia pulled within four points late in the final quarter, Boston hit timely three-pointers that prevented the 76ers from gaining any more ground. Despite Embiid's 30-point and 13-rebound performance on one good knee, James Harden and Tyrese Maxey's combined shooting of 7-for-30 (23%) left him with little offensive support.\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ESPN\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| May 7 3:30 pm\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Recap\n |\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Wells Fargo Center, Philadelphia, PA**Attendance:** 21,337**Referees:** David Guthrie, Ed Malloy, Curtis Blair\n |\n Jayson Tatum struggled mightily in the first three quarters, scoring just three points on 1-of-13 shooting. However, he came alive during the final quarter, dropping 16 points and leading a crucial 14\u20131 run in the final five minutes to force a Game 7 back in Boston. Despite trailing by as much as 16 points in the first half, the 76ers rallied thanks to the efforts of Joel Embiid and Tyrese Maxey, who helped the team take the lead entering the fourth quarter. However, Philadelphia faltered down the stretch, missing all eight of their three-point attempts in the fourth and failing to make a single field goal over the last six minutes until garbage time. Embiid and Maxey scored 26 points each, while James Harden shot a poor 4-of-16 from the field.\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ABC\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| May 14 3:30 pm\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Recap\n |\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Boston Celtics 3, **Philadelphia 76ers** **4** |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 1982 Eastern Conference finals\n |\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 1985\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Boston Celtics** **4**, Philadelphia 76ers 1\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 1985 Eastern Conference finals\n |\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 2002\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Boston Celtics** **3**, Philadelphia 76ers 2\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 2002 Eastern Conference First Round\n |\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 2012\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Boston Celtics** **4**, Philadelphia 76ers 3\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 2012 Eastern Conference semifinals\n |\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 2018\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Boston Celtics** **4**, Philadelphia 76ers 1\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 2018 Eastern Conference semifinals\n |\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 2020\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Boston Celtics** **4**, Philadelphia 76ers 0\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 2020 Eastern Conference First Round\n |\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Boston Celtics** **95**, Philadelphia 76ers 86\n |\n| **Scoring by quarter:** **29**\u201322, 21\u201321, 21\u2013**30**, **24**\u201313 |\n| **Pts:** Marcus Smart 22**Rebs:** Al Horford 11**Asts:** Marcus Smart 7 |  | **Pts:** Embiid, Maxey 26 each**Rebs:** Joel Embiid 10**Asts:** James Harden 9 |\n| ***Series tied, 3\u20133*** |\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Boston Celtics 115, **Philadelphia 76ers** **116**\u00a0(OT)\n |\n| **Scoring by quarter:** 19\u2013**27**, 31\u2013**32**, 33\u201333, **24**\u201315,\u00a0**Overtime:** 8\u2013**9** |\n| **Pts:** Jayson Tatum 24**Rebs:** Jayson Tatum 18**Asts:** Marcus Smart 7 |  | **Pts:** James Harden 42**Rebs:** Joel Embiid 13**Asts:** James Harden 9 |\n| ***Series tied, 2\u20132*** |\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| TD Garden, Boston, MA**Attendance:** 19,156**Referees:** David Guthrie, Courtney Kirkland, Karl Lane\n |\n Led by James Harden's 45 points, the 76ers rallied without Joel Embiid to beat the Celtics on the road to take a 1\u20130 series lead.

The season was suspended by league officials following the games of March 11[1] due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[2] On March 19, Marcus Smart announced that he tested positive for COVID-19.[3]\n\n\nOn June 4, the Celtics were one of 22 teams invited to the NBA Bubble.

Game 5 saw Brandon Bass score 27 points, including 18 in the third quarter as the Celtics blew out the Sixers, 101\u201385, to push them a win away from the Eastern Conference Finals. Before the start of Game 6, Allen Iverson presented the game ball, prompting huge cheers from the crowd. It was enough to motivate the Sixers to defeat the Celtics 82\u201375 to force a Game 7. Jrue Holiday scored 20 points, including two free-throws with 31 seconds to go to put the game away. Game 7 was a tight contest, with the two teams going back-and-forth. Paul Pierce fouled out late in the fourth quarter, but Rondo had his second triple-double of the series, including a fourth quarter that helped the Celtics advance to the Conference Finals to face the Miami Heat.\n\n\nThis series is an important plot point in the 2019 film *Uncut Gems*, in which Garnett co-stars.[20]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Sixers came off fresh of an upset over the injury-laden Bulls. Both the Celtics and the Sixers clinched their first round series on the same day. In Game 1, Rondo had another triple-double, but the Sixers held a 10-point lead with 10:53 left in the fourth quarter. However, the Celtics eventually came back, winning Game 1 by a point to take a 1\u20130 series lead. On the final possession, the Sixers were unable to foul a speedy Rondo, who dribbled out the clock. Game 2 saw the visitors lead for most of the game. With the Sixers leading 78\u201375 with 12 seconds to go, the Celtics squandered a chance to tie the game, as Garnett was called for an offensive foul. The Sixers then hit their final four free-throws to tie the series at 1 going back to Philadelphia. In Game 3, the Sixers held their last lead with 9:09 left in the second quarter as the Celtics took over the rest of the game to lead them to a 2\u20131 series advantage. In Game 4, the Celtics led by as much as 18 in the third quarter. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Boston Celtics 3, **Philadelphia 76ers** 4\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 1977 Eastern Conference Semifinals\n |\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 1980\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Boston Celtics 1, **Philadelphia 76ers** 4\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 1980 Eastern Conference Finals\n |\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 1981\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Boston Celtics** 4, Philadelphia 76ers 3\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 1981 Eastern Conference Finals\n |\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 1982\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Boston Celtics 3, **Philadelphia 76ers** 4\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 1982 Eastern Conference Finals\n |\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 1985\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Boston Celtics** 4, Philadelphia 76ers 1\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 1985 Eastern Conference Finals\n |\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 2002\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Boston Celtics** 3, Philadelphia 76ers 2\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 2002 Eastern Conference First Round\n |\n |\n\n\n### Western Conference semifinals\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWith their Game 7 win over the Philadelphia 76ers, the Boston Celtics returned to the Conference Finals for the third time in five seasons. With the loss, the Philadelphia 76ers suffered the same fate as last season\u2019s Memphis Grizzlies by beating a top seed, taking their fourth seed opponent to a Game 7, only to lose on the road. The 76ers would not return to the playoffs until 2018.\n\n\n\n### Conference finals\n\n[edit]\n\nFor the third consecutive season, the Miami Heat and the Boston Celtics met in the postseason.\n\n\nWith their Game 2 win over the Oklahoma City Thunder, the San Antonio Spurs won 20 straight games. As a result, they set an NBA record for the longest winning streak carried over from the regular season to the playoffs, which was broken with the Game 3 loss, and finished a win short of tying the longest unbeaten playoff run in a single postseason.[1]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Philadelphia 76ers 75, **Boston Celtics** **85** |\n| **Scoring by quarter:** 20\u201320, 13\u2013**21**, **19**\u201314, 23\u2013**30** |\n| **Pts:** Andre Iguodala 18**Rebs:** Thaddeus Young 10**Asts:** Jrue Holiday 9 |  | **Pts:** Garnett, Rondo 18 each**Rebs:** Kevin Garnett 13**Asts:** Rajon Rondo 10 |\n| ***Boston wins series, 4\u20133*** |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| TD Garden, Boston**Attendance:** 18,624**Referees:** Monty McCutchen, Tony Brothers, Mike Callahan,\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nRegular-season series\n\n\n| Philadelphia won 2\u20131 in the regular-season series\n |\n| --- |\n| |  |\n| --- |\n| March 7, 2012\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Recap\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Boston Celtics 71, **Philadelphia 76ers** **103** |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Wells Fargo Center, Philadelphia\n |\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| March 23, 2012\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Recap\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Boston Celtics 86, **Philadelphia 76ers** **99** |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Wells Fargo Center, Philadelphia\n |\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| April 8, 2012\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Recap\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Philadelphia 76ers 79, **Boston Celtics** **103** |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| TD Garden, Boston\n |\n |\n\n\nThis was the 20th playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Celtics winning 11 of the first 19 meetings.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious playoff series[21]\n| Boston leads 11\u20138 in all-time playoff series\n |\n| --- |\n| |  |\n| --- |\n| 1953\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Boston Celtics** 2, Syracuse Nationals 0\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 1953 Eastern Division Semifinals\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Philadelphia 76ers** **82**, Boston Celtics 81\n |\n| **Scoring by quarter:** 21\u2013**25**, **15**\u201313, **21**\u201311, 25\u2013**32** |\n| **Pts:** Jrue Holiday 18**Rebs:** Spencer Hawes 10**Asts:** Andre Iguodala 7 |  | **Pts:** Ray Allen 17**Rebs:** Kevin Garnett 12**Asts:** Rajon Rondo 13 |\n| ***Series tied, 1\u20131*** |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| TD Garden, Boston**Attendance:** 18,624**Referees:** Dan Crawford, Jason Phillips, Michael Smith,\n |\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| TNT\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| May 16 7:00 pm\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Recap\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Boston Celtics** **107**, Philadelphia 76ers 91\n |\n| **Scoring by quarter:** 28\u2013**33**, **32**\u201316, **29**\u201317, 18\u2013**25** |\n| **Pts:** Kevin Garnett 27**Rebs:** Kevin Garnett 13**Asts:** Rajon Rondo 14 |  | **Pts:** Thaddeus Young 22**Rebs:** Evan Turner 8**Asts:** Jrue Holiday 9 |\n| ***Boston leads series, 2\u20131*** |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Wells Fargo Center, Philadelphia**Attendance:** 20,351**Referees:** Derrick Stafford, Mike Callahan, Eric Lewis,\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| TD Garden, Boston**Attendance:** 18,624**Referees:** Ken Mauer, Ed Malloy, Rodney Mott,\n |\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ESPN\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| May 23 8:00 pm\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Recap\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Boston Celtics 75, **Philadelphia 76ers** **82** |\n| **Scoring by quarter:** 19\u2013**22**, **17**\u201311, 20\u2013**27**, 19\u2013**22** |\n| **Pts:** Paul Pierce 24**Rebs:** Kevin Garnett 11**Asts:** Rajon Rondo 6 |  | **Pts:** Jrue Holiday 20**Rebs:** Elton Brand 10**Asts:** Holiday, Williams 6 each |\n| ***Series tied, 3\u20133*** |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Wells Fargo Center, Philadelphia**Attendance:** 20,403**Referees:** Joe Crawford, James Capers, Ron Garretson,\n |\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ABC\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| May 26 8:00 pm\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Recap\n |\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn Game 7, the Celtics started strong. In the second quarter, Garnett picked up his third foul, giving the Heat a chance to try and take a lead. However, Bass led a run that pushed the Celtics' lead to 11. The Celtics would still have a 7-point lead at halftime. The third quarter was decisive once again, letting the Heat tie the game going to the fourth quarter, which was even more decisive. With the Celtics leading by 1 with 8 minutes left, James had a dunk that gave the Heat the lead. It was soon followed by Bosh's third three-pointer of the night (a career-high three 3 pointers) that gave the Heat the lead for good.

The Celtics still held a 2-point lead in the dying seconds, but Wade missed a potential game-winning 3 at the buzzer, giving the Celtics a 93\u201391 win to tie the series going back to Miami. \n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Philips Arena, Atlanta**Attendance:** 19,319**Referees:** Dan Crawford, David Jones, Tom Washington,\n |\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| TNT\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| May 10 8:00 pm\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Recap\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Atlanta Hawks 80, **Boston Celtics** **83** |\n| **Scoring by quarter:** **23**\u201320, 18\u2013**27**, **22**\u201320, **17**\u201316 |\n| **Pts:** Josh Smith 18**Rebs:** Horford, Smith 9 each**Asts:** Jeff Teague 6 |  | **Pts:** Kevin Garnett 28**Rebs:** Kevin Garnett 14**Asts:** Rajon Rondo 8 |\n| ***Boston wins series, 4\u20132*** |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| TD Garden, Boston**Attendance:** 18,624**Referees:** Derrick Stafford, Bill Kennedy, Eric Lewis,\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nCeltics proceeded to lead the series, 3\u20132, with a 94\u201390 win in Game 5. In the game, Bosh returned for the first time since he got injured in Game 1 of the Heat-Pacers series but was not much of a help on the offensive end. He came off the bench in the game and scored 9 points and grabbed 7 rebounds in 14 minutes played. With the Celtics leading by 1 with less than a minute to go, Pierce knocked down a crucial three-pointer that gave the Celtics the lead for good. \nThe Heat prevented a celebration from happening in Game 6 with a 98\u201379 blowout win at Boston to send the series back to Miami for a seventh and deciding game. James had one of his best playoff games, scoring 45 points and getting 15 rebounds, 30 of his 45 came in the first half alone.\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
