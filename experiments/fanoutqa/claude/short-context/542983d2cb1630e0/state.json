Among the nine justices, there are two African American justices (Justices Thomas and Jackson) and one Hispanic justice (Justice Sotomayor). One of the justices was born to at least one immigrant parent: Justice Alito's father was born in Italy.[121][122]\n\n\nAt least six justices are Roman Catholics, one is Jewish, and one is Protestant. It is unclear whether Neil Gorsuch considers himself a Catholic or an Episcopalian.[123] Historically, most justices have been Protestants, including 36 Episcopalians, 19 Presbyterians, 10 Unitarians, 5 Methodists, and 3 Baptists.[124][125] The first Catholic justice was Roger Taney in 1836,[126] and 1916 saw the appointment of the first Jewish justice, Louis Brandeis.[127] In recent years the historical situation has reversed, as most recent justices have been either Catholic or Jewish.\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Bush appointed him to the District of Columbia Circuit. During his two-year tenure on the D.C. Circuit, Roberts authored 49 opinions, eliciting two dissents from other judges, and authoring three dissents of his own.[13] In 2005, Bush nominated Roberts to the Supreme Court, initially to be an associate justice to fill the vacancy left by the retirement of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. Chief Justice William Rehnquist died shortly afterward, however, before Roberts's Senate confirmation hearings had begun. Bush then withdrew Roberts's nomination and instead nominated him to become Chief Justice, choosing Samuel Alito to replace O'Connor.\n\n\nRoberts has authored the majority opinion in many important cases, including decisions relating to elections, federal agencies, presidential power, the Affordable Care Act, and race-based college admissions.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n78. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Rosen, Jeffrey. \"Jeffrey Rosen: Big Chief \u2013 The New Republic\". *The New Republic*.

As the five other conservative justices could outvote the rest, he supposedly could no longer preside over a moderately conservative course while respecting precedent.[82][83] This view was espoused again after the 2022 *Dobbs* decision, which overturned rulings from 1973 and 1992.[84][85]\n\n\n\n### Early decisions[edit]\n\n\nOn January 17, 2006, Roberts dissented along with Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas in *Gonzales v. Oregon*, which held that the Controlled Substances Act does not allow the United States attorney general to prohibit physicians from prescribing drugs for the assisted suicide of the terminally ill as permitted by an Oregon law. The point of contention in the case was largely one of statutory interpretation, not federalism.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Roberts is sworn in as Chief Justice by Justice John Paul Stevens in the East Room of the White House as President Bush and Roberts's wife Jane look on, September 29, 2005.\nRoberts took the Constitutional oath of office, administered by Associate Justice John Paul Stevens at the White House, on September 29, 2005. On October 3, he took the judicial oath provided for by the Judiciary Act of 1789 at the United States Supreme Court building.\n\n\nJustice Antonin Scalia said that Roberts \"pretty much run[s] the show the same way\" as Rehnquist, albeit \"let[ting] people go on a little longer at conference ... but [he'll] get over that.\"[64] Roberts has been portrayed as a consistent advocate for conservative principles by analysts such as Jeffrey Toobin.[65] Garrett Epps has described Roberts's prose as \"crystalline, vivid, and often humorous\".[66]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| John Roberts\n |\n| --- |\n| ![Official portrait of John Roberts as Chief Justice of the United States](image)Official portrait, 2005\n |\n|  |\n| 17th Chief Justice of the United States |\n| **Incumbent**\n |\n| **Assumed office** September 29, 2005 |\n| Nominated by | George W.

Gore* is compared to Roberts's vote for the ACA: his vote in *National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius* to uphold the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) caused the press to contrast his Court with the Rehnquist Court.[77] Roberts's judicial philosophy is seen as more moderate and conciliatory than Antonin Scalia's and Clarence Thomas's.[78][79][77] He wishes more consensus from the Court.[78] At the beginning of his tenure, Roberts's voting pattern closely aligned with Samuel Alito's.[80] However, in recent years, his voting pattern has closely resembled Brett Kavanaugh's, who is generally seen as far more moderate than Alito.[81]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n (1955-01-27) January 27, 1955 (age\u00a069)Buffalo, New York, U.S. |\n| Spouse | \nJane Sullivan\n \u200b\n(m.\u00a01996)\u200b\n |\n| Children | 2 |\n| Education | Harvard University (BA, JD) |\n| Signature | ![Cursive signature in ink](image) |\n| John Roberts's voice\n\n\nJohn Roberts's opening statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee on his nomination to the Supreme CourtRecorded September 12, 2005\n |\n|  |\n\n\n**John Glover Roberts Jr.** (born January 27, 1955) is an American lawyer and jurist who has served as the 17th chief justice of the United States since 2005.[3] He has been described as having a moderate conservative judicial philosophy, though he is primarily an institutionalist.[4][5] He has shown a willingness to work with the Supreme Court's liberal bloc, and has been regarded as a swing vote on the Court.[6][7][8][9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

W. Bush nominated Thomas to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to fill the seat vacated by Robert Bork.[103][104] Thomas gained the support of other African American officials, including former transportation secretary William Coleman, and said that when meeting white Democratic staffers in the United States Senate, he was \"struck by how easy it had become for sanctimonious whites to accuse a black man of not caring about civil rights\".[65]\n\n\nIn February 1990, the Senate Judiciary Committee recommended Thomas by a vote of 12 to 1. On March 6, 1990, the Senate confirmed him to the Court of Appeals by a vote of 98 to 2.[102] He developed cordial relationships during his 19 months on the federal court, including with Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg.[65] During his judgeship, Thomas authored 19 opinions.[105]\n\n\n\n## Nomination to the Supreme Court[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Clarence Thomas Supreme Court nomination\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** U.S. presidents have traditionally submitted potential federal court nominees to the American Bar Association (ABA) for a confidential rating of their judicial temperament, competence and integrity on a three-level scale of well qualified, qualified or unqualified.[117] Adam Liptak of *The New York Times* noted that the ABA has historically taken generally liberal positions on divisive issues, and studies suggest that candidates nominated by Democratic presidents fare better in the group's ratings than those nominated by Republicans.[118]\n2. **^** Thomas was 43 years old when he was appointed to the Supreme Court.[172]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n3. **^** On average, from 1994 to 2004, Scalia and Thomas had an 87% voting alignment, the highest on the court, followed by Ruth Bader Ginsburg and David Souter (86%). In that same period, Thomas was the third-most-frequent dissenter on the Court, behind Stevens and Scalia.[179] Scalia's and Thomas's agreement rate peaked in 1996 at 98%.[179] By 2004, other pairs of justices were more closely aligned than Scalia and Thomas.[180]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSome legal scholars have called Thomas's views on race and the constitution \"idiosyncratic\",[286] \"pessimistic\", or \"fatalistic\".[287] For example, professors Corey Robin and Stephen F. Smith have characterized Thomas's philosophy as grounded in a form of black nationalism that sees governmental attempts to address racism as either futile or counterproductive.[287][288][289][290] That view contrasts with the belief that laws should be race-neutral because racial discrimination is no longer a serious problem in the United States.[286]\n\n\nThomas joined the majority in *Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard*, which struck down affirmative action in college admissions. He filed a concurring opinion, which he read from the bench, a rare practice for Supreme Court justices.[291]\n\n\n\n#### Abortion and family planning[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Justice Thomas administers the oath of office to Amy Coney Barrett (Oct 26, 2020)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Thomas, Andrew Peyton (Spring 2002). \"Clarence Thomas: The Law School Years\". *The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education* (35): 106\u2013114. doi:10.2307/3133873.
