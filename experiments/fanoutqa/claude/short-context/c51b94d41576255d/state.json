The major cities from other countries closest to the capital are Iqaluit and St. John's in Canada and Reykjav\u00edk in Iceland.

It began as a small fishing settlement with a harbor, but as the economy developed rapidly during the 1970s and 1980s, the fishing industry in the capital declined.[43] The port is nevertheless still home to almost half of Greenland's fishing fleet. The local Royal Greenland processing plant absorbs landed seafood amounting to over DKK 50 million (US$7\u00a0million) per annum, mainly (80%) shrimp, but also cod, lumpfish and halibut.[22] Seafood, including seal, is also sold in abundance in Nuuk's fish markets, the largest being Kalaaliaraq Market. Minerals including zinc and gold have contributed to the development of Nuuk's economy.[44]\n\n\nThe city, like much of Greenland, is heavily dependent upon Danish investment and relies on Denmark for block funding.[45]\n\n\n\n### Energy[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n64. **^** \"About the University\".

The population of Nuuk has doubled since 1977, increased by over a third since 1990, and risen by almost 21% since 2000. In addition to those born in Greenland, data from 2015 showed 3,826 were born outside the country.[33] Attracted by good employment opportunities with high wages, Danes have continued to settle in the town. Today, Nuuk has the highest proportion of Danes of any town in Greenland.[34] Half of Greenland's immigrants live in Nuuk, which also accounts for a quarter of the country's native population.[22]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

This Countryside Council was abolished on 1 May 1979, when the city of Godth\u00e5b was renamed Nuuk by the Greenland Home Rule government. The city boomed during the 1950s when Denmark began to modernize Greenland. As in Greenland as a whole, Nuuk is populated today by both Inuit and Danes. Over a third of Greenland's total population lives in the Nuuk Greater Metropolitan area.[17]\n\n\nAn article examining indigenous influences on cities worldwide[18] suggested,\n\n\n\n\n> One city... stands out. Nuuk... has probably the highest percentage of aboriginal people of any city: almost 90% of Greenland's population of 58,000 is Inuit, and at least eight in 10 live in urban settlements. Nuuk also celebrates Inuit culture and history to an extent that is unprecedented in many cities with higher total aboriginal populations. By proportion and by cultural authority and impact, it may well be tiny Nuuk that is the most indigenous city in the world.[18]\n> \n> \n> \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs of January 2021, the mayor of Nuuk is Charlotte Ludvigsen.

Nuuk is the seat of government and the territory's largest cultural and economic center. The major cities from other countries closest to the capital are Iqaluit and St. John's in Canada and Reykjav\u00edk in Iceland. Nuuk contains a third of Greenland's population and its tallest building. Nuuk is also the seat of government for the Sermersooq municipality. In January 2023, it had a population of 19,604.[3] Nuuk is considered a modernized city after the policy began in 1950.[4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Nuuk \u2013 Greenland's largest city and capital. Visitgreenland.com.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWith 19,604 inhabitants as of January 2023,[32] Nuuk is by far the largest town in Greenland. The population of Nuuk has doubled since 1977, increased by over a third since 1990, and risen by almost 21% since 2000. In addition to those born in Greenland, data from 2015 showed 3,826 were born outside the country.[33] Attracted by good employment opportunities with high wages, Danes have continued to settle in the town. Today, Nuuk has the highest proportion of Danes of any town in Greenland.[34] Half of Greenland's immigrants live in Nuuk, which also accounts for a quarter of the country's native population.[22]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues. There is more info on Phabricator and on MediaWiki.org.\n |\n\n\n## Government[edit]\n\n\nAs the capital of Greenland, Nuuk is the administrative center of the country, containing all of the important government buildings and institutions. The public sector bodies are also the town's largest employer.[22]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)The port of Nuuk\n![](image)Air Greenland headquarters in Nuuk\nAlthough only a small town, Nuuk has developed trade, business, shipping and other industries. It began as a small fishing settlement with a harbor, but as the economy developed rapidly during the 1970s and 1980s, the fishing industry in the capital declined.[43] The port is nevertheless still home to almost half of Greenland's fishing fleet. The local Royal Greenland processing plant absorbs landed seafood amounting to over DKK 50 million (US$7\u00a0million) per annum, mainly (80%) shrimp, but also cod, lumpfish and halibut.[22] Seafood, including seal, is also sold in abundance in Nuuk's fish markets, the largest being Kalaaliaraq Market. Minerals including zinc and gold have contributed to the development of Nuuk's economy.[44]\n\n\nThe city, like much of Greenland, is heavily dependent upon Danish investment and relies on Denmark for block funding.[45]\n\n\n\n### Energy[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Nuuk\n |\n| --- |\n| Capital city\n |\n| ![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n(left to right, top to bottom:) Downtown Nuuk, with Katuaq in the foreground; the Telet\u00e5rnet (\"Teletower\") office tower; Nuussuaq district; Qernertunnguit, neighbourhood in the Quassussuup Tungaa district; Sermitsiaq mountain overlooking Nuussuaq\n |\n| \n![Flag of Nuuk](image)Flag\n![](image)Coat of arms\n |\n| ![Nuuk is located in Greenland](image)![Nuuk](image)\nNuuk\nLocation within Greenland\nShow map of Greenland\n![Nuuk is located in North America](image)![Nuuk](image)\nNuuk\nNuuk (North America)\nShow map of North America\n |\n| Coordinates: 64\u00b010\u203253\u2033N 51\u00b041\u203239\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff64.18139\u00b0N 51.69417\u00b0W\ufeff / 64.18139; -51.69417 |\n| Sovereign state | ![](image)\u00a0Kingdom of Denmark |\n| Constituent country | ![](image)\u00a0Greenland |\n| Municipality | Sermersooq |\n| Founded | 29 August 1728 |\n| Incorporated | 1728 |\n| Area |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Total | 690\u00a0km2 (265\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) |\n| Elevation | 5\u00a0m (16\u00a0ft) |\n| Population(2023)\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n16. **^** Wittman, P. \"Greenland\". *The Catholic Encyclopedia*.

Built in 1979, it is a hub for Air Greenland, which is also headquartered in Nuuk[48] and operates its technical base at the airport. There are flights inside Greenland and to Iceland. A decision has been made to extend the runway to allow for flights to European destinations, such as Denmark.[49]\n\n\n\n### Sea[edit]\n\n\nAs a result of the high cost of flying goods to Greenland, Nuuk and other towns in Greenland are connected to Denmark by cargo vessels which sail mainly from Aalborg during the warmer months after the winter ice has melted. They bring clothing, flour, medicine, timber and machinery and return with deep-frozen shrimp and fish.[50] For most of the year, Nuuk is served twice-weekly by the coastal ferry of the Arctic Umiaq Line, which links the communities of the western coast.[51]\n\n\n\n### Roadways[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs of January 2021, the mayor of Nuuk is Charlotte Ludvigsen. She replaced former mayor Asii Chemnitz Narup in 2019 following a social media scandal involving posts criticizing her party. Like Narup, Ludvigsen is a member of the Inuit Ataqatigiit party.[35]\n\n\nGreenland's self-government parliament, the Inatsisartut, is in Nuuk.

At that time, Greenland was formally still a Norwegian colony (until 1814) under the united Dano-Norwegian Crown, but the colony had not had any contact for over three centuries. Paarss's colonists consisted of mutinous soldiers, convicts, and prostitutes and most died within the first year of scurvy and other ailments. In 1733 and 1734, a smallpox epidemic killed most of the native population as well as Egede's wife.[11] Hans Egede went back to Denmark in 1736 after 15 years in Greenland, leaving his son Poul to continue his work.[12] Godthaab became the seat of government for the Danish colony of South Greenland,[13] while Godhavn (modern Qeqertarsuaq) was the capital of North Greenland until 1940, when the administration was unified in Godthaab.[14]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe city was founded in 1728 by the Dano-Norwegian missionary Hans Egede when he relocated from the earlier Hope Colony (*Haabets Koloni*) where he arrived in 1721. The governor Claus Paarss was part of the relocation. The new colony was placed at the Inuit settlement of N\u00fbk and was named *Godthaab* (\"Good Hope\"). \"Nuuk\" is the Greenlandic word for \"cape\" (Danish: *n\u00e6s*) and is commonly found in Greenlandic place names. It is so named because of its position at the end of the Nuup Kangerlua fjord on the eastern shore of the Labrador Sea. Its latitude, at 64\u00b011' N, makes it the world's northernmost capital, only a few kilometres farther north than the Icelandic capital Reykjav\u00edk. When home rule was established in 1979, the authorization of place names was transferred to Greenlandic authorities, who subsequently preferred Greenlandic names over Danish ones. The name *Godth\u00e5b* mostly went out of use over the next two decades.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nUnder new regulations in 1950, two councils amalgamated into one. This Countryside Council was abolished on 1 May 1979, when the city of Godth\u00e5b was renamed Nuuk by the Greenland Home Rule government. The city boomed during the 1950s when Denmark began to modernize Greenland. As in Greenland as a whole, Nuuk is populated today by both Inuit and Danes. Over a third of Greenland's total population lives in the Nuuk Greater Metropolitan area.[17]\n\n\nAn article examining indigenous influences on cities worldwide[18] suggested,\n\n\n\n\n> One city... stands out. Nuuk... has probably the highest percentage of aboriginal people of any city: almost 90% of Greenland's population of 58,000 is Inuit, and at least eight in 10 live in urban settlements. Nuuk also celebrates Inuit culture and history to an extent that is unprecedented in many cities with higher total aboriginal populations. By proportion and by cultural authority and impact, it may well be tiny Nuuk that is the most indigenous city in the world.[18]\n> \n> \n> \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Queen Ingrid's Health Center\nThe city is served by Queen Ingrid's Health Center. The health center serves as the regional health center for Region Sermersooq. It has an emergency room, and a central clinic with several general practitioners. Nuuk also has Queen Ingrid's Hospital which is the central hospital of Greenland.\n\n\n\n### Tourism[edit]\n\n\nThe Nuuk Tourist Office was built in 1992 to house the headquarters of the new National Tourist Board of Greenland.[47]\n\n\n\n### Shopping[edit]\n\n\nShops in Nuuk offer local art and craftwork. In July 2012, Greenland's first shopping center, Nuuk Center *(NC)*, opened. The center has Greenland's first underground parking.

The Europeans had brought diseases and a culture that conflicted with the ways of the native Greenlanders. Many Greenlanders were living in poverty. In 1853, Hinrich Johannes Rink came to Greenland and was surprised at how local Greenlandic culture and identity had been suppressed under Danish influence. In response, in 1861, he started the *Atuagagdliutt*, Greenland's first newspaper, with a native Greenlander as editor. This newspaper based in Nuuk later became an important token of Greenlandic identity.\n\n\nDuring World War II, there was a reawakening of Greenlandic national identity. The use of written Greenlandic grew, a council was assembled under Eske Brun's leadership in Nuuk. In 1940, an American and a Canadian Consulate were established in Nuuk. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Total | 19,604 (Largest in Greenland) |\n|  | City and metropolitan population is co-extensive, the entire Metro area belongs to Nuuk City[*clarify*] |\n| Demonym | Nuummioq |\n| Time zone | UTC\u221202:00 (Western Greenland Time) |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Summer (DST) | UTC\u221201:00 (Western Greenland Summer Time) |\n| Postal code | 3900, 3905\n |\n| Website | www.sermersooq.gl |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAll of Greenland's electricity is supplied by the government-owned company Nukissiorfiit, which has a monopoly on the electricity in Greenland.[46] Since 1993, Nuuk has received its electric power mainly from Buksefjord hydroelectric power plant by way of a 132\u00a0kV powerline crossing Ameralik fjord over a distance of 5,376\u00a0m (17,638\u00a0ft), the world's longest free span.[7][8]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)University of Greenland\nNuuk has several educational institutions of higher learning.

It is one of the largest cities in the southwestern Pacific (along with Jayapura) outside of Australia and New Zealand. It is located on the shores of the Gulf of Papua, on the south-western coast of the Papuan Peninsula of the island of New Guinea. The city emerged as a trade centre in the second half of the 19th century. During World War II, it was a prime objective for conquest by the Imperial Japanese forces during 1942\u201343 as a staging point and air base to cut off Australia from Southeast Asia and the Americas.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPrior to the arrival of Europeans to the region, it was inhabited by the Motu-Koitabu. The Motu were originally coastal dwellers, while the Koitabu lived more inland.[4] There was significant intermarriage between these two groups. They were organized into units called *iduhu*, which are somewhat similar to clans.[4]\n\n\n\n### Colonisation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Queensland raises the British flag at Port Moresby in 1883\n![](image)Government House in Port Moresby\u2014still used today though substantially enlarged\u2014at the beginning of the 20th century\nIn 1883, Queensland attempted to annex the south-eastern corner of the New Guinea Island (subsequently known as Papua), fearing that Germany would take control of the entire eastern half of the island.[5] British authorities refused to approve the annexation following the German annexation of New Guinea in 1884, but four years later it established a protectorate over Papua as British New Guinea.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn September 1975, Papua New Guinea became an independent country with Port Moresby as its capital city. Prince Charles, Prince of Wales, represented the Queen of Papua New Guinea at the celebrations.[15] New government, intellectual and cultural buildings were constructed in the suburb of Waigani to supplement and replace those of downtown Port Moresby. They included those for government departments, including a National Parliament Building, which was opened in 1984 by Prince Charles and blends traditional design with modern building technology.[15]\n\n\nThe Papua New Guinea National Museum and National Library are in Waigani. A mansion was built in Port Moresby just west of the old legislative building but the last pre-independence chief minister and first prime minister of the sovereign state declared it not nearly grand enough; it was made the residence of Australian high commissioners and a mansion suitable to Somare's demands was built in Waigani.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n*Pot Mosbi*\n |\n| --- |\n| Capital city\n |\n| ![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n**Clockwise from top:** Downtown of Port Moresby, Sir John Guise Stadium, National Parliament House, Jacksons International Airport\n |\n| \n![Flag of Port Moresby](image)Flag\n |\n| OpenStreetMap\n![Map](image)\n |\n| ![Port Moresby is located in Papua New Guinea](image)![Port Moresby](image)\nPort Moresby\nLocation within Papua New Guinea\nShow map of Papua New Guinea\n![Port Moresby is located in Oceania](image)![Port Moresby](image)\nPort Moresby\nPort Moresby (Oceania)\nShow map of Oceania\n |\n| Coordinates: 9\u00b028\u203244\u2033S 147\u00b008\u203258\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff9.47889\u00b0S 147.14944\u00b0E\ufeff / -9.47889; 147.14944 |\n| Country | ![](image)\u00a0Papua New Guinea |\n| Division | National Capital District |\n| Established | 1873 |\n| Named for | Admiral Fairfax Moresby |\n| Government |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Governor | Powes Parkop (2007\u2013present) |\n| Area |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Capital city | 240\u00a0km2 (90\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) |\n| Elevation | 35\u00a0m (115\u00a0ft) |\n| Population(2011 census)\n |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Capital city | 364,145 |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* ![](image)New Guinea portal\n\n\n* Naval Base Port Moresby\n* Port Moresby Airfield Complex\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The longstanding downtown United Church with next door office building in 2013 were replaced with one building, the church on the ground floor.\n![](image)Downtown\nIn 1945, the Territory of Papua and New Guinea was formed when Papua and the former German New Guinea, which had been administered by Australia since 1918, were amalgamated under a single Australian administration though several laws remained in two territories and remain so, which can be complicating with provinces sitting on two sides of the otherwise extinct boundary. Port Moresby became the capital of the new combined territory and a focal point for the expansion of public services.

Though PNG is filled with resources, the lack of development led foreign countries to take over some sites. Continuing foreign demand for PNG's resources led the United States to set up an oil company that began to export in 2004. This was the largest project in PNG's history. The project increased the potential to triple PNG's export revenue. Papua New Guinea gained much assistance from Australia and was offered two hundred million dollars a year in aid, and many countries such as Singapore, Japan and China have also played a great part in PNG's industry business.[27] The decision to host the 2018 APEC meeting,[28] brought a large number of world leaders to Port Moresby.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n12. **^** Salak, Kira. \"Nonfiction book about Papua New Guinea,\"Four Corners\"\".

An unofficial 2020 estimate gives the population as 383,000.[2] The place where the city was founded has been inhabited by the Motu-Koitabu people for centuries. The first Briton to see it was Royal Navy Captain John Moresby in 1873. It was named in honour of his father, Admiral of the Fleet Sir Fairfax Moresby.\n\n\nAlthough Port Moresby is surrounded by Central Province, of which it is also the capital, it is not part of that province but forms the National Capital District. The traditional landowners, the Motu and Koitabu people, are represented by the Motu Koita Assembly.\n\n\nPort Moresby hosted the APEC summit in November 2018.[3] However, there were concerns about security given the capital's reputation for violent crime.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Hiri expedition arriving in Port Moresby in the 1990s\n### Before colonisation[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Sachse came ashore at Humboldt Bay near the mouth of the Numbay river. Their task was the systematic exploration of northern New Guinea and the search for a natural border between the Dutch and German spheres on New Guinea. Their camp along the river was called Kloofkamp, a name still in use as the name of an ancient district of Jayapura. Forty coconut trees were cut down for the establishment of the camp. They were bought from the owners at a cost of one rijksdaalder per palm.\n\n\nOn 7 March 1910, the Dutch flag was raised and the settlement was named *Hollandia*. On the other side of the bay there was already a German camp, *Germania-Huk* (German Corner), which is now uninhabited and part of Indonesian territory. Hollandia was the capital of a district of the same name in the northeast of West New Guinea. The name Hollandia was used until 1962.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe main newspaper in Papua, *Cenderawasih Pos*, is published in Jayapura.

It is one of the largest cities in the southwestern Pacific (along with Jayapura) outside of Australia and New Zealand. It is located on the shores of the Gulf of Papua, on the south-western coast of the Papuan Peninsula of the island of New Guinea. The city emerged as a trade centre in the second half of the 19th century. During World War II, it was a prime objective for conquest by the Imperial Japanese forces during 1942\u201343 as a staging point and air base to cut off Australia from Southeast Asia and the Americas.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n![Papua New Guinea](image) Provinces of Papua New Guinea\n |\n| --- |\n| Highlands Region | * Chimbu (Simbu)\n* Eastern Highlands\n* Enga\n* Hela\n* Jiwaka\n* Southern Highlands\n* Western Highlands\n |\n| Islands Region | * Bougainville1\n* East New Britain\n* Manus\n* New Ireland\n* West New Britain\n |\n| Momase Region | * East Sepik\n* Madang\n* Morobe\n* Sandaun (West Sepik)\n |\n| Southern Region | * Central\n* Gulf\n* Milne Bay\n* Oro (Northern)\n* Western\n* National Capital District (Port Moresby)\n |\n| **![](image) New Guinea portal** \u00a0\u2022 1 Autonomous region\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n*Pot Mosbi*\n |\n| --- |\n| Capital city\n |\n| ![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n**Clockwise from top:** Downtown of Port Moresby, Sir John Guise Stadium, National Parliament House, Jacksons International Airport\n |\n| \n![Flag of Port Moresby](image)Flag\n |\n| OpenStreetMap\n![Map](image)\n |\n| ![Port Moresby is located in Papua New Guinea](image)![Port Moresby](image)\nPort Moresby\nLocation within Papua New Guinea\nShow map of Papua New Guinea\n![Port Moresby is located in Oceania](image)![Port Moresby](image)\nPort Moresby\nPort Moresby (Oceania)\nShow map of Oceania\n |\n| Coordinates: 9\u00b028\u203244\u2033S 147\u00b008\u203258\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff9.47889\u00b0S 147.14944\u00b0E\ufeff / -9.47889; 147.14944 |\n| Country | ![](image)\u00a0Papua New Guinea |\n| Division | National Capital District |\n| Established | 1873 |\n| Named for | Admiral Fairfax Moresby |\n| Government |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Governor | Powes Parkop (2007\u2013present) |\n| Area |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Capital city | 240\u00a0km2 (90\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) |\n| Elevation | 35\u00a0m (115\u00a0ft) |\n| Population(2011 census)\n |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Capital city | 364,145 |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn September 1975, Papua New Guinea became an independent country with Port Moresby as its capital city. Prince Charles, Prince of Wales, represented the Queen of Papua New Guinea at the celebrations.[15] New government, intellectual and cultural buildings were constructed in the suburb of Waigani to supplement and replace those of downtown Port Moresby. They included those for government departments, including a National Parliament Building, which was opened in 1984 by Prince Charles and blends traditional design with modern building technology.[15]\n\n\nThe Papua New Guinea National Museum and National Library are in Waigani. A mansion was built in Port Moresby just west of the old legislative building but the last pre-independence chief minister and first prime minister of the sovereign state declared it not nearly grand enough; it was made the residence of Australian high commissioners and a mansion suitable to Somare's demands was built in Waigani.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The longstanding downtown United Church with next door office building in 2013 were replaced with one building, the church on the ground floor.\n![](image)Downtown\nIn 1945, the Territory of Papua and New Guinea was formed when Papua and the former German New Guinea, which had been administered by Australia since 1918, were amalgamated under a single Australian administration though several laws remained in two territories and remain so, which can be complicating with provinces sitting on two sides of the otherwise extinct boundary. Port Moresby became the capital of the new combined territory and a focal point for the expansion of public services. Port Moresby was granted city status in 1972, with Oala Oala-Rarua becoming the first Lord Mayor.[14]\n\n\n\n### Independence[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nCapitals of Oceania\n |\n| --- |\n| Dependent territories are in italics\n |\n| Australasia | * **Canberra**, Australia\n* **Wellington**, New Zealand1\n |\n| Melanesia | * **Honiara**, Solomon Islands\n* **Noum\u00e9a**, *New Caledonia*2\n* **Port Moresby**, Papua New Guinea3\n* **Port Vila**, Vanuatu\n* **Suva**, Fiji\n |\n| Micronesia | * **Hag\u00e5t\u00f1a**, *Guam*4\n* **Majuro**, Marshall Islands5\n* **Ngerulmud**, Palau5\n* **Palikir**, Federated States of Micronesia5\n* **Saipan**, *Northern Mariana Islands*4\n* **South Tarawa**, Kiribati\n* **Yaren**, Nauru (de facto)\n |\n| Polynesia | * **Adamstown**, *Pitcairn Islands*6\n* **Alofi**, *Niue*7\n* **Apia**, Samoa\n* **Avarua**, *Cook Islands*7\n* **Fakaofo**, *Tokelau*8\n* **Funafuti**, Tuvalu\n* **Mata Utu**, *Wallis and Futuna* (de facto)2\n* **Nuku\u02bbalofa**, Tonga\n* **Pago Pago**, *American Samoa*4\n* **Papeete**, *French Polynesia*2\n |\n| * 1Often included in Polynesia\n* 2Overseas collectivities or *sui generis* collectivity of France\n* 3Often included in Australasia\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe National Capital District machinery of government also incorporates the Motu Koita Assembly, established by an act of parliament to represent the traditional landowners of Port Moresby, the Motu and Koitabu people. The Assembly governs the traditional lands and inhabitants of the ten recognised villages, and is the only entity of its kind in Papua New Guinea. The Chair of the Motu Koita Assembly also holds the position of Deputy Governor of the National Capital District.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nPort Moresby refers to both the urbanised area of the National Capital District and more specifically to the main business area, known locally as \"Town\".[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPrior to the arrival of Europeans to the region, it was inhabited by the Motu-Koitabu. The Motu were originally coastal dwellers, while the Koitabu lived more inland.[4] There was significant intermarriage between these two groups. They were organized into units called *iduhu*, which are somewhat similar to clans.[4]\n\n\n\n### Colonisation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Queensland raises the British flag at Port Moresby in 1883\n![](image)Government House in Port Moresby\u2014still used today though substantially enlarged\u2014at the beginning of the 20th century\nIn 1883, Queensland attempted to annex the south-eastern corner of the New Guinea Island (subsequently known as Papua), fearing that Germany would take control of the entire eastern half of the island.[5] British authorities refused to approve the annexation following the German annexation of New Guinea in 1884, but four years later it established a protectorate over Papua as British New Guinea.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* ![](image)New Guinea portal\n\n\n* Naval Base Port Moresby\n* Port Moresby Airfield Complex\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Hanuabada, which offers a safe haven for LGBT people in PNG[21]\n* Kira Kira village[22] (sometimes spelt Kirakira[23]), the home town of Australian footballer Mary Fowler's mother\n\n\n## Crime[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Crime in Papua New Guinea\n\n*Al Jazeera* describes Port Moresby as \"one of the most dangerous cities in the world\".[24] *ABC Australia* reports that \"many homes have big fences covered in metal sheeting, locked gates and internal steel security doors.\"[25]\nTravel by foot is not recommended in and about the city and suburbs due to continuing breakdown in law and order. The UN Global Compact Cities Programme, using a method called Circles of Sustainability, has assessed the urban security of Port Moresby as 'critical'.[26]\n\n\n\n## Transport[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs of the 2011 census, Port Moresby had 364,145 inhabitants. An unofficial 2020 estimate gives the population as 383,000.[2] The place where the city was founded has been inhabited by the Motu-Koitabu people for centuries. The first Briton to see it was Royal Navy Captain John Moresby in 1873. It was named in honour of his father, Admiral of the Fleet Sir Fairfax Moresby.\n\n\nAlthough Port Moresby is surrounded by Central Province, of which it is also the capital, it is not part of that province but forms the National Capital District. The traditional landowners, the Motu and Koitabu people, are represented by the Motu Koita Assembly.\n\n\nPort Moresby hosted the APEC summit in November 2018.[3] However, there were concerns about security given the capital's reputation for violent crime.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Hiri expedition arriving in Port Moresby in the 1990s\n### Before colonisation[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThere has been substantial building of housing, office towers, shopping malls and commercial establishments over much of the city.[*citation needed*] The waterfront area has been completely redeveloped with apartments, restaurants and shopping centres. Sporting facilities were upgraded significantly for the 2015 South Pacific Games, and further development took place in preparation for the 2016 FIFA Under-20 Women's World Cup.[29]\n\n\nAir Niugini, the national airline of Papua New Guinea, and Airlines PNG, the second biggest airline in the country, have their head offices on the grounds of Jacksons International Airport.[30]\n\n\n\n## Sports[edit]\n\n\nThe 1969 South Pacific Games, held from 13 to 23 August 1969 at Port Moresby, were the third South Pacific Games to be held. A total of 1,150 athletes participated.[31]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1905, the recently federated Australian government passed the Papua Act which came into effect in 1906. The act transferred Papua, with Port Moresby as its capital, to direct Australian rule. From then until 1941 Port Moresby grew slowly. The main growth was on the peninsula, where port facilities and other services were gradually improved. The first butcher's shop and grocery opened in 1909,[6] electricity was introduced in 1925,[7] and piped water supply was provided in 1941.[8]\n\n\n\n![](image)Douglas Street, Port Moresby: Old hotel lot, vacant for 30 years, and new building behind it.\n### World War II[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Port Moresby, seen from the International Space Station\nPapua New Guinea is rich in natural resources, which account for two thirds of its export earnings. Though PNG is filled with resources, the lack of development led foreign countries to take over some sites. Continuing foreign demand for PNG's resources led the United States to set up an oil company that began to export in 2004. This was the largest project in PNG's history. The project increased the potential to triple PNG's export revenue. Papua New Guinea gained much assistance from Australia and was offered two hundred million dollars a year in aid, and many countries such as Singapore, Japan and China have also played a great part in PNG's industry business.[27] The decision to host the 2018 APEC meeting,[28] brought a large number of world leaders to Port Moresby.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe 1991 South Pacific Games held from 7\u201321 September 1991 at Port Moresby and along Lae were the ninth South Pacific Games to be held. This was the first time that events at one games had been held in two cities. The decision to do so was to allow both locations to benefit from the construction of new facilities.[32]\n\n\nCricket PNG is the official governing body of the sport of cricket in Papua New Guinea. Its headquarters is in Port Moresby. Cricket PNG is Papua New Guinea's representative at the International Cricket Council and is an associate member and has been a member of that body since 1973. It is also a member of the East Asia-Pacific Cricket Council.[33][34]\n\n\nThe city hosted the 2017 FIBA Melanesia Basketball Cup, where the Papua New Guinea national basketball team won the gold medal.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n17. **^** \"World Weather Information Service\u00a0\u2014 Port Moresby\".

The city sits at 1,280\u00a0m (4,199\u00a0ft) above sea level in the center of the island, the highest national capital by elevation among the island countries. It has been the country's largest population center since at least the 18th century. The presidency, National Assembly, Senate and Supreme Court are located there, as are 21 diplomatic missions and the headquarters of many national and international businesses and NGOs.

These conquests continued under his son, Radama I, who eventually controlled over two-thirds of the island, leading him to be considered the King of Madagascar by European diplomats. Antananarivo remained the island's capital after Madagascar was colonized by the French in 1897, and after independence in 1960.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* **Lusaka**, Zambia\n* **Malabo**, Equatorial Guinea\n* **Maputo**, Mozambique\n* **Maseru**, Lesotho\n* + **Mbabane** (executive)\n\t+ **Lobamba** (legislative), Eswatini\n* **Mogadishu**, Somalia\n* **Monrovia**, Liberia\n* **Moroni**, Comoros\n* **Nairobi**, Kenya\n* **N'Djamena**, Chad\n* **Niamey**, Niger\n* **Nouakchott**, Mauritania\n* **Ouagadougou**, Burkina Faso\n* **Port Louis**, Mauritius\n* **Porto-Novo**, Benin\n* **Praia**, Cape Verde\n* + **Pretoria** (executive)\n\t+ **Cape Town** (legislative)\n\t+ **Bloemfontein** (judicial), South Africa\n* **Rabat**, Morocco\n* **S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9**, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe\n* **Tripoli**, Libya\n* **Tunis**, Tunisia\n* **Victoria**, Seychelles\n* **Windhoek**, Namibia\n* + **Yamoussoukro** (political)\n\t+ **Abidjan** (economic), Ivory Coast\n* **Yaound\u00e9**, Cameroon\n |\n| * 1 An unrecognised or partially-recognised nation\n* 2 British Overseas Territory\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nTananarive\n |\n| --- |\n| Capital city\n |\n| ![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nFile:Kriegerdenkmal Antananarivo 2019-10-02.jpg\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nLake Anosy Central Antananarivo, Jacarandas blooming, Lake Anozy, Royal chapel, Chemin des Dames, bust of Philibert Tsiranana, Mausol\u00e9e d'Andrainarivo, Train station, Presidential office\n |\n| \n![Flag of Antananarivo](image)Flag\n![Coat of arms of Antananarivo](image)Coat of arms\n |\n| Nickname:\u00a0Tana\n |\n| ![Antananarivo is located in Madagascar](image)![Antananarivo](image)\nAntananarivo\nLocation in Madagascar & Africa\nShow map of Madagascar\n![Antananarivo is located in Africa](image)![Antananarivo](image)\nAntananarivo\nAntananarivo (Africa)\nShow map of Africa\n |\n| Coordinates: 18\u00b056\u2032S 47\u00b031\u2032E\ufeff / \ufeff18.933\u00b0S 47.517\u00b0E\ufeff / -18.933; 47.517 |\n| Country | ![](image)\u00a0Madagascar |\n| Region | Analamanga |\n| Historic Countries/Colonies | Merina Kingdom  Malagasy Protectorate  French Madagascar |\n| Founded | 1610 or 1625 |\n| Government |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nUpon Andriamasinavalona's death in 1710, Imerina split into four warring quadrants, and Antananarivo was made the capital of the southern district.[15] During the 77-year civil war that followed, the eastern district's capital at Ambohimanga rose in prominence.[16] The last king of Ambohimanga, Andrianampoinimerina, successfully conquered Antananarivo in 1793;[17] he reunited the provinces of Imerina, ending the civil war. He moved the kingdom's political capital back to Antananarivo in 1794,[15] and declared Ambohimanga the kingdom's spiritual capital, a role it still maintains.[18] Andrianampoinimerina created a large marketplace in Analakely, establishing the city's economic center.[19]\n\n\n\n### Kingdom of Madagascar[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Institut National de la Statistique Madagascar (web)\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Institut National de la Statistique, Madagascar.\n3. **^** Dictionary.com: Antananarivo\n4. **^** Dictionary.com: Tananarive\n5. **^** Oxford Dictionary: Tananarive (American English)\n6. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** Shillington 2004, p.\u00a0158.\n7. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Callet 1908, pp.\u00a0654\u2013656.\n8. **^** Government of France 1898, pp.\u00a0918\u2013919.\n9. **^** Desmonts 2004, pp.\u00a0114\u2013115.\n10. **^** Roman Adrian Cybriwsky, *Capital Cities around the World: An Encyclopedia of Geography, History, and Culture*, ABC-CLIO, USA, 2013, p. 15\n11. **^** Callet 1908, p.\u00a0522.\n12. **^** Callet 1908, pp.\u00a0563\u2013565.\n13. **^** Acquier 1997, pp.\u00a063\u201364.\n14. **^** Oliver 1886, p.\u00a0221.\n15. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Royal Hill of Ambohimanga\".

The city's population reached 1.4\u00a0million by the end of the 20th century; in 2013, it was estimated at nearly 2.1\u00a0million.[33] Uncontrolled urban sprawl has challenged the city's infrastructure, producing shortages of clean water and electricity, sanitation and public health problems, and heavy traffic congestion.[31] There are more than 5,000 church buildings in the city and its suburbs, including an Anglican and a Roman Catholic cathedral. Antananarivo is the see city of Madagascar's Roman Catholic Archdiocese. The city has repeatedly been the site of large demonstrations and violent political clashes, including the 1972 *rotaka* that brought down President Philibert Tsiranana and the 2009 Malagasy political crisis, which resulted in Andry Rajoelina replacing Marc Ravalomanana as head of state.[34]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n104. **^** Madagasikara, Redaction Midi (October 31, 2018). \"Rapport de l'OMS\u00a0: Antananarivo, parmi les villes les plus pollu\u00e9es au monde \u2013 Midi Madagasikara\" (in French).

These venues do not show international releases but occasionally screen Malagasy films or are used for private events and religious services.[72]\n\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\nRugby Union is considered the national sport of Madagascar.[77] The national rugby team is nicknamed the Makis after the local word for the indigenous ring-tailed lemur. The team trains and plays domestic matches at Maki Stadium in Antananarivo. Constructed in 2012, the stadium has a capacity of 15,000 and houses a gym and administrative offices for the team.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAntananarivo was historically the capital of the Merina people, who continue to form the majority of the city's 1,275,207 (2018 Census[2]) inhabitants. The surrounding urban areas have a total metropolitan population approaching three million. All eighteen Malagasy ethnic groups, as well as residents of Chinese, Indian, European and other origins, are represented in the city. It was founded circa 1610, when the Merina King Andrianjaka (1612\u20131630) expelled the Vazimba inhabitants of the village of Analamanga. Declaring it the site of his capital, Andrianjaka built a *rova* (fortified royal dwelling) that expanded to become the royal palaces of the Kingdom of Imerina. The city retained the name Analamanga until the reign of King Andriamasinavalona (1675\u20131710), who renamed it Antananarivo (\"City of the Thousand\") in honor of Andrianjaka's soldiers.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe British diplomats who concluded trade treaties with Radama recognized him as the \"ruler of Madagascar\", a position he and his successors claimed despite never managing to impose their authority over the larger portion of the island's south. Thereafter, Merina sovereigns declared Antananarivo the capital of the entire island.[23]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n75. **^** \"Qui Sommes Nous?\". Goethe Institut Antananarivo. 2013.

The city gradually spread out from this central point to cover the hillsides; by the late 19th century it had expanded to the flat terrain at the base of the hills. These plains are susceptible to flooding during the rainy season; they are drained by the Ikopa River, which skirts the capital to the south and west. The western slopes and plains, being best protected from cyclone winds originating over the Indian Ocean, were settled before those to the east.[6]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs the historic capital of Imerina, Antananarivo is centrally located in the homeland of the Merina people, who comprise about 24 percent of the population and are the largest Malagasy ethnic group. The city's history as the island's major center for politics, culture, and trade has ensured a cosmopolitan mix of ethnic groups from across the island and overseas.[30] Most Antananarivo residents have strong ties to their *tanindrazana* (ancestral village), where the extended family and typically a family tomb or burial place is located; many older residents leave the city upon retirement to return to their rural area of origin.[56]\n\n\n\n### Crime[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Fournet-Gu\u00e9rin, Catherine (2007). *Vivre \u00e0 Tananarive: g\u00e9ographie du changement dans la capitale malgache*.

During World War II, it was a prime objective for conquest by the Imperial Japanese forces during 1942\u201343 as a staging point and air base to cut off Australia from Southeast Asia and the Americas.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Official Port Moresby\u2212National Capital District website Archived 23 March 2023 at the Wayback Machine\n* ![](image) Port Moresby travel guide from Wikivoyage\n\n\n![](image)\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Port Moresby.\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nProvincial capitals of Papua New Guinea\n |\n| --- |\n| * Alotau (MB)\n* Buka (Bougainville)\n* Daru (Western)\n* Goroka (EHP)\n* Kavieng (NI)\n* Kerema (Gulf)\n* Kimbe (WNB)\n* Kokopo (ENB)\n* Kundiawa (Chimbu)\n* Lae (Morobe)\n* Lorengau (Manus)\n* Madang (Madang)\n* Mendi (SHP)\n* Mount Hagen (WHP)\n* Popondetta (Oro)\n* Port Moresby (Central/NCD)\n* Tari (Hela)\n* Vanimo (WS)\n* Wabag (Enga)\n* Wewak (ES)\n | ![](image)\n |\n| **![](image) New Guinea portal**\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n*Pot Mosbi*\n |\n| --- |\n| Capital city\n |\n| ![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n**Clockwise from top:** Downtown of Port Moresby, Sir John Guise Stadium, National Parliament House, Jacksons International Airport\n |\n| \n![Flag of Port Moresby](image)Flag\n |\n| OpenStreetMap\n![Map](image)\n |\n| ![Port Moresby is located in Papua New Guinea](image)![Port Moresby](image)\nPort Moresby\nLocation within Papua New Guinea\nShow map of Papua New Guinea\n![Port Moresby is located in Oceania](image)![Port Moresby](image)\nPort Moresby\nPort Moresby (Oceania)\nShow map of Oceania\n |\n| Coordinates: 9\u00b028\u203244\u2033S 147\u00b008\u203258\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff9.47889\u00b0S 147.14944\u00b0E\ufeff / -9.47889; 147.14944 |\n| Country | ![](image)\u00a0Papua New Guinea |\n| Division | National Capital District |\n| Established | 1873 |\n| Named for | Admiral Fairfax Moresby |\n| Government |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Governor | Powes Parkop (2007\u2013present) |\n| Area |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Capital city | 240\u00a0km2 (90\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) |\n| Elevation | 35\u00a0m (115\u00a0ft) |\n| Population(2011 census)\n |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Capital city | 364,145 |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The longstanding downtown United Church with next door office building in 2013 were replaced with one building, the church on the ground floor.\n![](image)Downtown\nIn 1945, the Territory of Papua and New Guinea was formed when Papua and the former German New Guinea, which had been administered by Australia since 1918, were amalgamated under a single Australian administration though several laws remained in two territories and remain so, which can be complicating with provinces sitting on two sides of the otherwise extinct boundary. Port Moresby became the capital of the new combined territory and a focal point for the expansion of public services. Port Moresby was granted city status in 1972, with Oala Oala-Rarua becoming the first Lord Mayor.[14]\n\n\n\n### Independence[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn September 1975, Papua New Guinea became an independent country with Port Moresby as its capital city. Prince Charles, Prince of Wales, represented the Queen of Papua New Guinea at the celebrations.[15] New government, intellectual and cultural buildings were constructed in the suburb of Waigani to supplement and replace those of downtown Port Moresby. They included those for government departments, including a National Parliament Building, which was opened in 1984 by Prince Charles and blends traditional design with modern building technology.[15]\n\n\nThe Papua New Guinea National Museum and National Library are in Waigani. A mansion was built in Port Moresby just west of the old legislative building but the last pre-independence chief minister and first prime minister of the sovereign state declared it not nearly grand enough; it was made the residence of Australian high commissioners and a mansion suitable to Somare's demands was built in Waigani.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPrior to the arrival of Europeans to the region, it was inhabited by the Motu-Koitabu. The Motu were originally coastal dwellers, while the Koitabu lived more inland.[4] There was significant intermarriage between these two groups. They were organized into units called *iduhu*, which are somewhat similar to clans.[4]\n\n\n\n### Colonisation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Queensland raises the British flag at Port Moresby in 1883\n![](image)Government House in Port Moresby\u2014still used today though substantially enlarged\u2014at the beginning of the 20th century\nIn 1883, Queensland attempted to annex the south-eastern corner of the New Guinea Island (subsequently known as Papua), fearing that Germany would take control of the entire eastern half of the island.[5] British authorities refused to approve the annexation following the German annexation of New Guinea in 1884, but four years later it established a protectorate over Papua as British New Guinea.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nCapitals of Oceania\n |\n| --- |\n| Dependent territories are in italics\n |\n| Australasia | * **Canberra**, Australia\n* **Wellington**, New Zealand1\n |\n| Melanesia | * **Honiara**, Solomon Islands\n* **Noum\u00e9a**, *New Caledonia*2\n* **Port Moresby**, Papua New Guinea3\n* **Port Vila**, Vanuatu\n* **Suva**, Fiji\n |\n| Micronesia | * **Hag\u00e5t\u00f1a**, *Guam*4\n* **Majuro**, Marshall Islands5\n* **Ngerulmud**, Palau5\n* **Palikir**, Federated States of Micronesia5\n* **Saipan**, *Northern Mariana Islands*4\n* **South Tarawa**, Kiribati\n* **Yaren**, Nauru (de facto)\n |\n| Polynesia | * **Adamstown**, *Pitcairn Islands*6\n* **Alofi**, *Niue*7\n* **Apia**, Samoa\n* **Avarua**, *Cook Islands*7\n* **Fakaofo**, *Tokelau*8\n* **Funafuti**, Tuvalu\n* **Mata Utu**, *Wallis and Futuna* (de facto)2\n* **Nuku\u02bbalofa**, Tonga\n* **Pago Pago**, *American Samoa*4\n* **Papeete**, *French Polynesia*2\n |\n| * 1Often included in Polynesia\n* 2Overseas collectivities or *sui generis* collectivity of France\n* 3Often included in Australasia\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Hanuabada, which offers a safe haven for LGBT people in PNG[21]\n* Kira Kira village[22] (sometimes spelt Kirakira[23]), the home town of Australian footballer Mary Fowler's mother\n\n\n## Crime[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Crime in Papua New Guinea\n\n*Al Jazeera* describes Port Moresby as \"one of the most dangerous cities in the world\".[24] *ABC Australia* reports that \"many homes have big fences covered in metal sheeting, locked gates and internal steel security doors.\"[25]\nTravel by foot is not recommended in and about the city and suburbs due to continuing breakdown in law and order.

The main growth was on the peninsula, where port facilities and other services were gradually improved.

Though PNG is filled with resources, the lack of development led foreign countries to take over some sites. Continuing foreign demand for PNG's resources led the United States to set up an oil company that began to export in 2004. This was the largest project in PNG's history. The project increased the potential to triple PNG's export revenue. Papua New Guinea gained much assistance from Australia and was offered two hundred million dollars a year in aid, and many countries such as Singapore, Japan and China have also played a great part in PNG's industry business.[27] The decision to host the 2018 APEC meeting,[28] brought a large number of world leaders to Port Moresby.\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Before this event, Iqaluit was a small city and not well known outside the Canadian Arctic or Canada, with population and economic growth highly limited. This is due to the city's isolation and heavy dependence on expensive imported supplies, as the city, like the rest of Nunavut, has no road or rail, and only has ship connections for part of the year to the rest of Canada. The city has a polar climate, influenced by the cold deep waters of the Labrador Current just off Baffin Island\u2014this makes the city of Iqaluit cold, although it is well south of the Arctic Circle.\n\n\nAs of the 2021 Canadian census, the population was 7,429[5] (population centre: 6,991[6]), a decrease of 4.0 per cent from the 2016 census. Iqaluit has the lowest population of any capital city in Canada. Inhabitants of Iqaluit are called *Iqalummiut* (singular: *Iqalummiuq*).\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nCapital city of Nunavut, Canada\n\nFor the film, see *Iqaluit* (film).\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This article **needs additional citations for verification**.

They included those for government departments, including a National Parliament Building, which was opened in 1984 by Prince Charles and blends traditional design with modern building technology.[15]\n\n\nThe Papua New Guinea National Museum and National Library are in Waigani. A mansion was built in Port Moresby just west of the old legislative building but the last pre-independence chief minister and first prime minister of the sovereign state declared it not nearly grand enough; it was made the residence of Australian high commissioners and a mansion suitable to Somare's demands was built in Waigani.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe National Capital District machinery of government also incorporates the Motu Koita Assembly, established by an act of parliament to represent the traditional landowners of Port Moresby, the Motu and Koitabu people. The Assembly governs the traditional lands and inhabitants of the ten recognised villages, and is the only entity of its kind in Papua New Guinea. The Chair of the Motu Koita Assembly also holds the position of Deputy Governor of the National Capital District.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nPort Moresby refers to both the urbanised area of the National Capital District and more specifically to the main business area, known locally as \"Town\".[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs of the 2011 census, Port Moresby had 364,145 inhabitants. An unofficial 2020 estimate gives the population as 383,000.[2] The place where the city was founded has been inhabited by the Motu-Koitabu people for centuries. The first Briton to see it was Royal Navy Captain John Moresby in 1873. It was named in honour of his father, Admiral of the Fleet Sir Fairfax Moresby.\n\n\nAlthough Port Moresby is surrounded by Central Province, of which it is also the capital, it is not part of that province but forms the National Capital District. The traditional landowners, the Motu and Koitabu people, are represented by the Motu Koita Assembly.\n\n\nPort Moresby hosted the APEC summit in November 2018.[3] However, there were concerns about security given the capital's reputation for violent crime.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Hiri expedition arriving in Port Moresby in the 1990s\n### Before colonisation[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPrior to the arrival of Europeans to the region, it was inhabited by the Motu-Koitabu. The Motu were originally coastal dwellers, while the Koitabu lived more inland.[4] There was significant intermarriage between these two groups. They were organized into units called *iduhu*, which are somewhat similar to clans.[4]\n\n\n\n### Colonisation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Queensland raises the British flag at Port Moresby in 1883\n![](image)Government House in Port Moresby\u2014still used today though substantially enlarged\u2014at the beginning of the 20th century\nIn 1883, Queensland attempted to annex the south-eastern corner of the New Guinea Island (subsequently known as Papua), fearing that Germany would take control of the entire eastern half of the island.[5] British authorities refused to approve the annexation following the German annexation of New Guinea in 1884, but four years later it established a protectorate over Papua as British New Guinea.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n12. **^** Salak, Kira. \"Nonfiction book about Papua New Guinea,\"Four Corners\"\".

The act transferred Papua, with Port Moresby as its capital, to direct Australian rule. From then until 1941 Port Moresby grew slowly. The main growth was on the peninsula, where port facilities and other services were gradually improved. The first butcher's shop and grocery opened in 1909,[6] electricity was introduced in 1925,[7] and piped water supply was provided in 1941.[8]\n\n\n\n![](image)Douglas Street, Port Moresby: Old hotel lot, vacant for 30 years, and new building behind it.\n### World War II[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Port Moresby, seen from the International Space Station\nPapua New Guinea is rich in natural resources, which account for two thirds of its export earnings. Though PNG is filled with resources, the lack of development led foreign countries to take over some sites. Continuing foreign demand for PNG's resources led the United States to set up an oil company that began to export in 2004. This was the largest project in PNG's history. The project increased the potential to triple PNG's export revenue. Papua New Guinea gained much assistance from Australia and was offered two hundred million dollars a year in aid, and many countries such as Singapore, Japan and China have also played a great part in PNG's industry business.[27] The decision to host the 2018 APEC meeting,[28] brought a large number of world leaders to Port Moresby.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nCapitals of Oceania\n |\n| --- |\n| Dependent territories are in italics\n |\n| Australasia | * **Canberra**, Australia\n* **Wellington**, New Zealand1\n |\n| Melanesia | * **Honiara**, Solomon Islands\n* **Noum\u00e9a**, *New Caledonia*2\n* **Port Moresby**, Papua New Guinea3\n* **Port Vila**, Vanuatu\n* **Suva**, Fiji\n |\n| Micronesia | * **Hag\u00e5t\u00f1a**, *Guam*4\n* **Majuro**, Marshall Islands5\n* **Ngerulmud**, Palau5\n* **Palikir**, Federated States of Micronesia5\n* **Saipan**, *Northern Mariana Islands*4\n* **South Tarawa**, Kiribati\n* **Yaren**, Nauru (de facto)\n |\n| Polynesia | * **Adamstown**, *Pitcairn Islands*6\n* **Alofi**, *Niue*7\n* **Apia**, Samoa\n* **Avarua**, *Cook Islands*7\n* **Fakaofo**, *Tokelau*8\n* **Funafuti**, Tuvalu\n* **Mata Utu**, *Wallis and Futuna* (de facto)2\n* **Nuku\u02bbalofa**, Tonga\n* **Pago Pago**, *American Samoa*4\n* **Papeete**, *French Polynesia*2\n |\n| * 1Often included in Polynesia\n* 2Overseas collectivities or *sui generis* collectivity of France\n* 3Often included in Australasia\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n7. **^** \"Progress in Papua\". *The Argus*.

Several coal deposits are located in the northern part of the island,[32] concentrated in Fukushima Prefecture and Niigata Prefecture, though Honshu's coal production is negligible in comparison to Hokkaido and Kyushu.[33] Most of Japan's oil reserves are also located in northern Honshu, along the west coast, spanning Niigata, Yamagata, and Akita Prefectures.[34]\n\n\nMost of Japan's copper, lead, zinc and chromite is located on Honshu, along with smaller, scattered deposits of gold, silver, arsenic, sulfur and pyrite.[35]\n\n\n\n## Transportation[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* ![](image)\u00a0Aichi Prefecture\n* ![](image)\u00a0Fukui Prefecture\n* ![](image)\u00a0Gifu Prefecture\n* ![](image)\u00a0Ishikawa Prefecture\n* ![](image)\u00a0Nagano Prefecture\n* ![](image)\u00a0Niigata Prefecture\n* ![](image)\u00a0Shizuoka Prefecture\n* ![](image)\u00a0Toyama Prefecture\n* ![](image)\u00a0Yamanashi Prefecture\n* ---\n\nKansai\n\n* ![](image)\u00a0Hy\u014dgo Prefecture\n* ![](image)\u00a0Kyoto Prefecture\n* ![](image)\u00a0Mie Prefecture\n* ![](image)\u00a0Nara Prefecture\n* ![](image)\u00a0Osaka Prefecture\n* ![](image)\u00a0Shiga Prefecture\n* ![](image)\u00a0Wakayama Prefecture\n* ---\n\nCh\u016bgoku\n\n* ![](image)\u00a0Hiroshima Prefecture\n* ![](image)\u00a0Okayama Prefecture\n* ![](image)\u00a0Shimane Prefecture\n* ![](image)\u00a0Tottori Prefecture\n* ![](image)\u00a0Yamaguchi Prefecture\n* ---\n |\n| Largest settlement | ![](image)\u00a0Tokyo (pop.\u00a014,043,239) |\n| Demographics |\n| Population | 104,000,000[2] (2017) |\n| Pop. density | 447/km2 (1158/sq\u00a0mi) |\n| Ethnic groups | Japanese |\n| Additional information |\n| Time zone | * Japan Standard Time (UTC+9)\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Japan as seen from a satellite. Honshu is the largest, middle island.\nThe island is roughly 1,300\u00a0km (810\u00a0mi) long and ranges from 50 to 230\u00a0km (31 to 143\u00a0mi) wide, and its total area is 227,960\u00a0km2 (88,020\u00a0sq\u00a0mi),[1] making it slightly larger than the island of Great Britain 209,331\u00a0km2 (80,823\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).[10] Its land area has been increasing with land reclamation and coastal uplift in the north due to plate tectonics with a convergent boundary. Honshu has 10,084 kilometres (6,266\u00a0mi) of coastline.[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFruit, vegetables, grains, rice and cotton make up the main produce grown in Honshu.[26] The Tohoku region, spanning the north-eastern part of the island, is notable for its rice production, with 65% of cultivated land being rice paddy fields \u2013 almost a quarter of all paddy fields in Japan.[27] Chiba Prefecture is famous for its peanuts, also being the largest producer in Japan.[28] Rare species of the lichen genus Menegazzia are found only in Honshu.[29]\n\n\n\n### Industry[edit]\n\n\nMost of Japan's tea and silk is from Honshu.[26] Japan's three largest industrial regions are all located on Honshu: the Keihin region, the Hanshin Industrial Region, and the Ch\u016bky\u014d Industrial Area.\n\n\n\n### Minerals and fuels[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Tokaido Shinkansen, opened in 1964 between Tokyo and Shin-\u014csaka, is Japan's first high-speed rail line.[36] It is the world's oldest high-speed rail line and one of the most heavily used.[37][38] The San'y\u014d Shinkansen, connects the two largest cities in western Japan, Shin-Osaka in Osaka with Hakata Station in Fukuoka. Both the Tokaido Shinkansen and the Sanyo Shinkansen help form a continuous high-speed railway through the Taiheiy\u014d Belt megalopolis.\n\n\n\n![](image)Mt.

The first air raid to strike Honshu and the other home islands was the Doolittle Raid. With the introduction of the Boeing B-29 Superfortress, the firebombing of Tokyo culminated in Operation Meetinghouse, the most destructive air raid in human history, which destroyed 16 square miles (41\u00a0km2; 10,000 acres) of central Tokyo, leaving an estimated 100,000 civilians dead, and over one million homeless.[17] The war ended with the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki shortly before Japan's surrender and signing of the Japanese Instrument of Surrender on September 2, 1945, on board the USS\u00a0*Missouri*\u00a0(BB-63) in Tokyo Bay.\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Hokkaid\u014d | * Hokkaido\n |\n| T\u014dhoku | * Aomori\n* Iwate\n* Miyagi\n* Akita\n* Yamagata\n* Fukushima\n |\n| Kant\u014d | * Ibaraki\n* Tochigi\n* Gunma\n* Saitama\n* Chiba\n* Tokyo\n* Kanagawa\n |\n| Ch\u016bbu | * Niigata\n* Toyama\n* Ishikawa\n* Fukui\n* Yamanashi\n* Nagano\n* Gifu\n* Shizuoka\n* Aichi\n |\n| Kansai | * Mie\n* Shiga\n* Kyoto\n* Osaka\n* Hy\u014dgo\n* Nara\n* Wakayama\n |\n| Ch\u016bgoku | * Tottori\n* Shimane\n* Okayama\n* Hiroshima\n* Yamaguchi\n |\n| Shikoku | * Tokushima\n* Kagawa\n* Ehime\n* K\u014dchi\n |\n| Ky\u016bsh\u016b | * Fukuoka\n* Saga\n* Nagasaki\n* Kumamoto\n* \u014cita\n* Miyazaki\n* Kagoshima\n* Okinawa\n |\n\n |\n| * Category\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Farjon, Aljos; Filer, Denis (2013). *An Atlas of the World's Conifers: An Analysis of their Distribution, Biogeography, Diversity and Conservation Status*.
