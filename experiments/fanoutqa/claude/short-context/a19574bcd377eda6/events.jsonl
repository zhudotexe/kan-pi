Members of the royal family are members of the Church of England\nGiven the royal family's public role and activities, it is sometimes referred to by courtiers as \"The Firm\", a term that originated with George VI.[32][33] Members of the royal family are politically and commercially independent, avoiding conflict of interest with their public roles.[34] The royal family are considered British cultural icons, with young adults from abroad naming the family among a group of people who they most associated with British culture.[35] Members are expected to promote British industry.[36] Royals are typically members of the Church of England, headed by the monarch.

The surname of the male-line descendants of Queen Elizabeth II, except for women who marry, is Mountbatten-Windsor, reflecting the name taken by her Greek-born husband, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, upon his naturalisation. A surname is generally not needed by members of the royal family who are entitled to the titles of prince or princess and the style His or Her Royal Highness. Such individuals use surnames on official documents such as marriage registers.[16]\n\n\n\n## Public role[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)The Princess Royal meeting members of the public during a walkabout in Paisley, Renfrewshire\nMembers of the royal family support the monarch in \"state and national duties\", while also carrying out charity work of their own.[17][18] If the sovereign is indisposed, two counsellors of state are required to fulfil his role, with those eligible being restricted to the sovereign's spouse, and the first four people in the line of succession over the age of 21.
