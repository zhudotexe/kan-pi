Let me search for the Nobel Prize in Literature history.\n\n\nLet me search the more specific article title.\n\n\nLet me search specifically for information about the first winner.\n\n\nLet me search for more details about the first five winners individually.\n\n\nBased on the search results, I can provide information about the first Nobel Prize in Literature winner and the early history of the prize:\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Literature was first awarded in 1901 to Ren\u00e9 Fran\u00e7ois Armand \"Sully\" Prudhomme (1839-1907), a French poet and essayist. Here are the key details:\n\n1. First Winner: Sully Prudhomme was awarded the prize \"in special recognition of his poetic composition, which gives evidence of lofty idealism, artistic perfection and a rare combination of the qualities of both heart and intellect.\"\n\n2. Early History:\n- The prize was established in 1895 by Alfred Nobel's will\n- It began being awarded in 1901\n- The Swedish Academy is responsible for selecting the winners\n- The prize has been awarded 116 times between 1901 and 2023 to 120 individuals (103 men and 17 women)\n\n3. About Sully Prudhomme:\n- He was born in Paris in 1839\n- Originally studied to be an engineer but turned to philosophy and poetry\n- His notable works include \"Stances et Po\u00e8mes\" (1865), which included his famous poem \"Le vase bris\u00e9\"\n- He was also elected to the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise in 1881\n- After winning the Nobel Prize, he used much of his prize money to create a poetry prize awarded by the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des gens de lettres\n- He died in 1907 at Ch\u00e2tenay-Malabry, France\n\n4. Early Controversy:\nIt's worth noting that the early prize selections have been criticized by literary historians. Some notable authors who were overlooked in favor of now lesser-known writers included Leo Tolstoy, Henrik Ibsen, \u00c9mile Zola, and Mark Twain. The literary historian Kjell Espmark later admitted that \"as to the early prizes, the censure of bad choices and blatant omissions is often justified.\"\n\nThe first five winners of the Nobel Prize in Literature were:\n1901: Sully Prudhomme (France)\n1902: Theodor Mommsen (Germany)\n1903: Bj\u00f8rnstjerne Bj\u00f8rnson (Norway)",

Let me search for the Nobel Prize in Literature winners from those years.\n\n\nLet me search for information about the 1904 co-winner and the 1905 winner.\n\n\nLet me search for information about Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mistral, who shared the 1904 Nobel Prize with Echegaray.\n\n\nBased on the search results, I can provide information about Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mistral and his shared 1904 Nobel Prize in Literature. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mistral (1830-1914) was a French writer who wrote in Occitan literature and was a lexicographer of the Proven\u00e7al form of the language. He shared the 1904 Nobel Prize in Literature with Jos\u00e9 Echegaray.\n\nKey points about Mistral and the 1904 Nobel Prize:\n\n1. He received the prize \"in recognition of the fresh originality and true inspiration of his poetic production, which faithfully reflects the natural scenery and native spirit of his people, and, in addition, his significant work as a Proven\u00e7al philologist.\"\n\n2. He was nominated by two professors from the Swedish Uppsala University.\n\n3. He shared the prize money equally with Jos\u00e9 Echegaray, who was honored for his Spanish dramas.\n\n4. Mistral devoted his half of the prize money to the creation of the Museum at Arles, known locally as \"Museon Arlaten,\" which became the most important collection of Proven\u00e7al folk art, displaying furniture, costumes, ceramics, tools and farming implements.\n\nMistral was particularly notable for his efforts to restore and promote the Proven\u00e7al language. His major works included:\n- \"Mir\u00e8io\" (1859) - his most important work, a long poem about thwarted love\n- \"Lou Tresor d\u00f3u F\u00e9librige\" (1878-1886) - a comprehensive bilingual Occitan-French dictionary\n- He was also a founding member of F\u00e9librige, a literary and cultural association promoting the Occitan language.\n\nIn addition to the Nobel Prize, Mistral was also awarded the L\u00e9gion d'honneur, which was unusual as it was typically only awarded for national achievements, while Mistral's work was specifically focused on Provence.",

The prize has been shared between two individuals on four occasions. It was not awarded on seven occasions. The laureates have included writers in 25 different languages. The youngest laureate was Rudyard Kipling, who was 41 years old when he was awarded in 1907. The oldest laureate to receive the prize was Doris Lessing, who was 88 when she was awarded in 2007. It has been awarded posthumously once, to Erik Axel Karlfeldt in 1931. On some occasions, the awarding institution, the Swedish Academy, has awarded the prize to its own members; Verner von Heidenstam in 1916, the posthumous prize to Karlfeldt in 1931, P\u00e4r Lagerkvist in 1951, and the shared prize to Eyvind Johnson and Harry Martinson in 1974. Selma Lagerl\u00f6f was elected a member of the Swedish Academy in 1914, five years after she was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1909. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe **Nobel Prize in Literature** (here meaning *for* literature; Swedish: *Nobelpriset i litteratur*) is a Swedish literature prize that is awarded annually, since 1901, to an author from any country who has, in the words of the will of Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel, \"in the field of literature, produced the most outstanding work in an idealistic direction\" (original Swedish: *den som inom litteraturen har producerat det utm\u00e4rktaste i idealisk riktning*).[2][3] Though individual works are sometimes cited as being particularly noteworthy, the award is based on an author's body of work as a whole. The Swedish Academy decides who, if anyone, will receive the prize. The academy announces the name of the laureate in early October. It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the will of Alfred Nobel in 1895. Literature is traditionally the final award presented at the Nobel Prize ceremony. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n35. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** \"A unique gold medal\". Nobel Foundation.

The prize-awarding organisations followed: the Karolinska Institutet on 7 June, the Swedish Academy on 9 June, and the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences on 11 June.[14][15] The Nobel Foundation then reached an agreement on guidelines for how the Nobel Prize should be awarded. In 1900, the Nobel Foundation's newly created statutes were promulgated by King Oscar II.[13][16][17] According to Nobel's will, the prize in literature should be determined by \"the Academy in Stockholm\", which was specified by the statutes of the Nobel Foundation to mean the Swedish Academy.[18]\n\n\n\n## Nomination and award procedure[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of nominees for the Nobel Prize in Literature.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n61. **^** Warme, Lars G., ed.

Sometimes, however, the award has been announced the year after the nominal year, the latest such case being the 2018 award. In the midst of controversy surrounding claims of sexual assault, conflict of interest, and resignations by officials, on 4 May 2018, the Swedish Academy announced that the 2018 laureate would be announced in 2019 along with the 2019 laureate.[5][4] Some years, such as in 1949, no candidate received the required majority of the votes, and for that reason, the prize was postponed and announced the following year.[26]\n\n\n\n## Prizes[edit]\n\n\nA Literature Nobel Prize laureate receives a gold medal, a diploma bearing a citation, and a sum of money.[27] The amount of money awarded depends on the income of the Nobel Foundation that year.[28] The literature prize can be shared between two, but not three, laureates.[29] If a prize is awarded jointly, the prize money is split equally between them.[30]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThousands of requests are sent out each year, and as of 2011[update] about 220 proposals were returned.[20] These proposals must be received by the Academy by 1 February, after which they are examined by the Nobel Committee, a working group within the Academy comprising four to five members.[21] By April, the committee narrows the field to around 20 candidates.[20] By May, a shortlist of five names is approved by the Academy.[20] The next four months are spent reading and reviewing the works of the five candidates.[20] In October, members of the Academy vote, and the candidate who receives more than half of the votes is named the Nobel laureate in Literature. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n### Controversies about Nobel laureate selections[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Nobel Prize controversies \u00a7\u00a0Literature\n\nFrom 1901 to 1912, the committee, led by the conservative Carl David af Wirs\u00e9n, assessed the literary quality of a work in relation to its contribution to humanity's pursuit of the \"ideal.\" Leo Tolstoy, Henrik Ibsen, \u00c9mile Zola, and Mark Twain were rejected in favour of authors who are little read today.[47][49]\n\n\nLater, the prize has often been controversial due to the Swedish Academy's Eurocentric choices of laureates for political reasons, as seen in the years 1970, 2005, and 2019, and for the Academy awarding its own members, as happened in 1974.[50]\n\n\n\n### Nationality-based criticism[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNobel Prize Laureates in Literature are awarded for the author's life work, but on some occasions, the Academy has singled out a specific work for particular recognition. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n83. **^** L\u00f6fgren, Emma (29 August 2018). \"Four writers shortlisted for 'the new Nobel Literature Prize'\". *The Local*.

The literary historian Kjell Espmark admitted that \"as to the early prizes, the censure of bad choices and blatant omissions is often justified. Tolstoy, Ibsen, and Henry James should have been rewarded instead of, for instance, Sully Prudhomme, Eucken, and Heyse.\"[57] There are omissions which are beyond the control of the Nobel Committee such as the early death of an author as was the case with Marcel Proust, Italo Calvino, and Roberto Bola\u00f1o. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n44. **^** Feldman, Burton (2000). *The Nobel Prize: A History of Genius, Controversy, and Prestige*.

Members of the Academy, members of literature academies and societies, professors of literature and language, former Nobel literature laureates, and the presidents of writers' organisations are all allowed to nominate a candidate. It is not allowed to nominate oneself.[19]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAlthough the Nobel Prize in Literature has become the world's most prestigious literature prize,[42] the Swedish Academy has attracted significant criticism for its handling of the award. Many authors who have won the prize have fallen into obscurity, while others rejected by the jury remain widely studied and read. In the *Wall Street Journal*, Joseph Epstein wrote, \"You might not know it, but you and I are members of a club whose fellow members include Leo Tolstoy, Henry James, Anton Chekhov, Mark Twain, Henrik Ibsen, Marcel Proust, James Joyce, Jorge Luis Borges and Vladimir Nabokov. The club is the Non-Winners of the Nobel Prize in Literature. All these authentically great writers, still alive when the prize, initiated in 1901, was being awarded, didn't win it.\"[43] Other notable names from the non-western canon who were ignored despite being nominated several times for the prize include Sri Aurobindo and Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNominations are kept secret for fifty years until they are publicly available at The Nomination Database for the Nobel Prize in Literature. Currently, only nominations submitted between 1901 and 1971 are available for public viewing.[40]\n\n\n\n\n> What about the rumours circling around the world about certain people being nominated for the Nobel Prize this year? \u2013 Well, either it's just a rumour, or someone among the invited nominators has leaked information.

He was the first winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1901.\n\n\nBorn in Paris, Prudhomme originally studied to be an engineer, but turned to philosophy and later to poetry; he declared it as his intention to create scientific poetry for modern times. In character sincere and melancholic, he was linked to the Parnassus school, although, at the same time, his work displays characteristics of its own.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nPrudhomme was born to a French shopkeeper.[1]\n\n\nPrudhomme attended the Lyc\u00e9e Bonaparte, but eye trouble interrupted his studies. He worked for a while in the Creusot region for the Schneider steel foundry, and then began studying law in a notary's office. The favourable reception of his early poems by the *Conf\u00e9rence La Bruy\u00e8re* (a student society) encouraged him to begin a literary career.\n\n\n\n## Writing[edit]\n\n\nHis first collection, *Stances et Po\u00e8mes* (\"Stanzas and Poems\", 1865), was praised by Sainte-Beuve. It included his most famous poem, *Le vase bris\u00e9*. He published more poetry before the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War. This war, which he discussed in *Impressions de la guerre* (1872) and *La France* (1874), permanently damaged his health.\n\n\nDuring his career, Prudhomme gradually shifted from the sentimental style of his first books towards a more personal style which unified the formality of the Parnassus school with his interest in philosophical and scientific subjects. One of his inspirations was clearly Lucretius's *De rerum natura*, whose first book he translated into verse. His philosophy was expressed in *La Justice* (1878) and *Le Bonheur* (1888). The extreme economy of means employed in these poems has, however, usually been judged as compromising their poetical quality without advancing their claims as works of philosophy. He was elected to the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise in 1881. Another distinction, *Chevalier de la L\u00e9gion d\u2019honneur*, was to follow in 1895.\n\n\nAfter *Le Bonheur*, Prudhomme turned from poetry to write essays on aesthetics and philosophy. He published two important essays: *L'Expression dans les beaux-arts* (1884) and *R\u00e9flexions sur l'art des vers* (1892), a series of articles on Blaise Pascal in *La Revue des Deux Mondes* (1890), and an article on free will (*La Psychologie du Libre-Arbitre*, 1906) in the *Revue de m\u00e9taphysique et de morale*.\n\n\n\n## Nobel Prize[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 1901 Nobel Prize in Literature\n\nThe first writer to receive the Nobel Prize for Literature (given \"in special recognition of his poetic composition, which gives evidence of lofty idealism, artistic perfection and a rare combination of the qualities of both heart and intellect\"), he devoted the bulk of the money he received to the creation of a poetry prize awarded by the *Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des gens de lettres*. He also founded, in 1902, the *Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des po\u00e8tes fran\u00e7ais* with Jose-Maria de Heredia and Leon Dierx.\n\n\n\n## Death[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Grave of Sully Prudhomme at P\u00e8re-Lachaise in Paris.\nAt the end of his life, his poor health (which had troubled him ever since 1870) forced him to live almost as a recluse at Ch\u00e2tenay-Malabry, suffering attacks of paralysis while continuing to work on essays. He died suddenly on 6 September 1907, and was buried at P\u00e8re-Lachaise in Paris.\n\n\n\n## Bibliography[edit]\n\n\n### Poetry[edit]\n\n\n* 1865: *Stances et po\u00e8mes*\n* 1866: *Les \u00e9preuves*\n* 1868: *Croquis italiens*\n* 1869: *Les solitudes: po\u00e9sies* [*Les \u00e9curies d\u2019Augias*]\n* 1872: *Les destins*\n* 1874: *La r\u00e9volte des fleurs*\n* 1874: *La France*\n* 1875: *Les vaines tendresses*\n* 1876: *Le z\u00e9nith*, previously published in *Revue des deux mondes*\n* 1878: *La justice*\n* 1865\u20131888: *Po\u00e9sie*\n* 1886: *Le prisme, po\u00e9sies diverses*\n* 1888: *Le bonheur*\n* 1908: *\u00c9paves*\n\n\n### Prose[edit]\n\n\n* 1883\u20131908: *\u0152uvres de Sully Prudhomme* (poetry and prose), 8 volumes, A.

Here are the key details:\n\n1. First Winner: Sully Prudhomme was awarded the prize \"in special recognition of his poetic composition, which gives evidence of lofty idealism, artistic perfection and a rare combination of the qualities of both heart and intellect.\"\n\n2. Early History:\n- The prize was established in 1895 by Alfred Nobel's will\n- It began being awarded in 1901\n- The Swedish Academy is responsible for selecting the winners\n- The prize has been awarded 116 times between 1901 and 2023 to 120 individuals (103 men and 17 women)\n\n3. About Sully Prudhomme:\n- He was born in Paris in 1839\n- Originally studied to be an engineer but turned to philosophy and poetry\n- His notable works include \"Stances et Po\u00e8mes\" (1865), which included his famous poem \"Le vase bris\u00e9\"\n- He was also elected to the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise in 1881\n- After winning the Nobel Prize, he used much of his prize money to create a poetry prize awarded by the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des gens de lettres\n- He died in 1907 at Ch\u00e2tenay-Malabry, France\n\n4. Early Controversy:\nIt's worth noting that the early prize selections have been criticized by literary historians. Some notable authors who were overlooked in favor of now lesser-known writers included Leo Tolstoy, Henrik Ibsen, \u00c9mile Zola, and Mark Twain. The literary historian Kjell Espmark later admitted that \"as to the early prizes, the censure of bad choices and blatant omissions is often justified.\"\n\nThe first five winners of the Nobel Prize in Literature were:\n1901: Sully Prudhomme (France)\n1902: Theodor Mommsen (Germany)\n1903: Bj\u00f8rnstjerne Bj\u00f8rnson (Norway)",

They shared the prize money equally.[5] Mistral devoted his half to the creation of the Museum at Arles, known locally as \"Museon Arlaten\". The museum is considered to be the most important collection of Proven\u00e7al folk art, displaying furniture, costumes, ceramics, tools and farming implements. In addition, Mistral was awarded the L\u00e9gion d'honneur. This was a most unusual occurrence since it is usually only awarded for notable achievement on a national level, whereas Mistral was uniquely Proven\u00e7al in his work and achievement.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* 1980: Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz\n |\n| 1981\u20132000 | * 1981: Elias Canetti\n* 1982: Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez\n* 1983: William Golding\n* 1984: Jaroslav Seifert\n* 1985: Claude Simon\n* 1986: Wole Soyinka\n* 1987: Joseph Brodsky\n* 1988: Naguib Mahfouz\n* 1989: Camilo Jos\u00e9 Cela\n* 1990: Octavio Paz\n* 1991: Nadine Gordimer\n* 1992: Derek Walcott\n* 1993: Toni Morrison\n* 1994: Kenzabur\u014d \u014ce\n* 1995: Seamus Heaney\n* 1996: Wis\u0142awa Szymborska\n* 1997: Dario Fo\n* 1998: Jos\u00e9 Saramago\n* 1999: G\u00fcnter Grass\n* 2000: Gao Xingjian\n |\n| 2001\u20132020 | * 2001: V.

As early as 1471, his paternal ancestor, Mermet Mistral, lived in Maillane.[1] By 1588, the Mistral family lived in Saint-R\u00e9my-de-Provence.[1]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFrench Proven\u00e7al writer and lexicographer (1830\u20131914)\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t+ \"He who has seen Paris and not Cassis has seen nothing.\"\n\n\n## Works[edit]\n\n\n* *Mir\u00e8io* (1859) - PDF (in Proven\u00e7al)\n* *Calendau* (1867) - online\n* *Lis Isclo d\u2019or* (1875) - en ligne\u00a0: part I, part II\n* *Nerto*, short story (1884) - online\n* *La R\u00e8ino Jano*, drama (1890) - en ligne\n* *Lou Pou\u00e8mo d\u00f3u Rose* (1897) - online\n* *Moun espelido, Mem\u00f2ri e Raconte* (Mes m\u00e9moires) (1906) - online\n* *Discours e dicho* (1906) - online\n* *La Gen\u00e8si, traducho en prouven\u00e7au* (1910) - online\n* *Lis \u00f3ulivado* (1912) - online\n* *Lou Tresor d\u00f3u Felibrige ou Dictionnaire proven\u00e7al-fran\u00e7ais embrassant les divers dialectes de la langue d'oc moderne* (1878\u20131886) - online\n* *Proso d\u2019Armana* (posthume) (1926, 1927, 1930) - online\n* *Coupo Santo* (1867)\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* The works of Antonin Merci\u00e9\n* List of works by Louis Botinelly\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMistral is the author of *Lou Tresor d\u00f3u F\u00e9librige* (1878\u20131886), which to date remains the most comprehensive dictionary of the Occitan language, and one of the most reliable, thanks to the precision of its definitions. It is a bilingual dictionary, Occitan-French, in two large volumes, with all of the dialects of *oc*, including Proven\u00e7al. Mistral owes to Fran\u00e7ois Vidal the work of typesetting and revising that dictionary.\n\n\n\n## *Mir\u00e8io* \u2013 *Mireille*[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mistral during his career.\nMistral's most important work is *Mir\u00e8io* (*Mireille*), published in 1859, after eight years of effort. *Mir\u00e8io*, a long poem in Proven\u00e7al consisting of twelve songs, tells of the thwarted love of Vincent and Mireille, two young Proven\u00e7al people of different social backgrounds. The name Mireille (Mir\u00e8io in Provence) is a doublet of the word *meraviho* which means wonder.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter receiving his bachelor's degree in N\u00eemes, Mistral studied law in Aix-en-Provence from 1848 to 1851. He became a champion for the independence of Provence, and in particular for restoring the \"first literary language of civilized Europe\"\u2014Proven\u00e7al. He had studied the history of Provence during his time in Aix-en-Provence. Emancipated by his father, Mistral resolved: \"to raise, revive in Provence the feeling of race ...; to move this rebirth by the restoration of the natural and historical language of the country ...; to restore the fashion to Provence by the breath and flame of divine poetry\". For Mistral, the word race designates \"people linked by language, rooted in a country and in a story\".\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe seven founders of the organization were (to use their Proven\u00e7al names): J\u00f3us\u00e8 Roumaniho, Frederi Mistral, Teodor Aubanel, Ans\u00e8ume Mati\u00e9u, Jan Brunet, Anfos Tavan and Paul Giera. F\u00e9librige exists to this day, one of the few remaining cultural organizations in 32 departments of the \"Langue d'Oc\".\n\n\nMistral strove to rehabilitate the language of Provence, while carrying it to the highest summits of epic poetry. He redefined the language in its purest form by creating a dictionary and transcribing the songs of the troubadours, who spoke the language in its original form.\n\n\n\n## Lexicography: *Lou Tresor d\u00f3u Felibrige*[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTo you, I dedicate Mireille:\nIt is my heart and my soul;\nIt is the flower of my years;\nIt is bunch of grapes from La Crau, leaves and all, a peasant's offering.\"\n\n\nLamartine wrote enthusiastically: \"I will tell you good news today! A great epic poet is born ... A true Homeric poet in our time; ... Yes, your epic poem is a masterpiece; ... the perfume of your book will not evaporate in a thousand years.\"\n\n\n*Mir\u00e8io* was translated into some fifteen European languages, including into French by Mistral himself. In 1863, Charles Gounod made it into an opera, *Mireille*.\n\n\n\n## Quotations[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Relief of Mistral by Jean Barnab\u00e9 Amy\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

Among other tales, he tells of Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer, where according to legend the dragon Tarasque was driven out, and of the famous and ancient Venus of Arles. He prefaced the poem with a short notice about Proven\u00e7al pronunciation.\n\n\nThe poem tells how Mireille's parents wish her to marry a Proven\u00e7al landowner, but she falls in love with a poor basket maker named Vincent, who loves her as well. After rejecting three rich suitors, a desperate Mireille, driven by the refusal of her parents to let her marry Vincent, runs off to Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer to pray to the patrons of Provence to change her parents' minds. Having forgotten to bring a hat, she falls victim to the heat, dying in Vincent's arms under the gaze of her parents.\n\n\nMistral dedicated his book to Alphonse de Lamartine as follows:\n\n\n\"To Lamartine:\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | You can help **expand this article with text translated from the corresponding article in Polish and French**. *(December 2021)* Click [show] for important translation instructions.\n* \n* Machine translation, like DeepL or Google Translate, is a useful starting point for translations, but translators must revise errors as necessary and confirm that the translation is accurate, rather than simply copy-pasting machine-translated text into the English Wikipedia.\n* Do not translate text that appears unreliable or low-quality.

He was awarded the 1904 Nobel Prize in Literature \"in recognition of the numerous and brilliant compositions which, in an individual and original manner, have revived the great traditions of the Spanish drama\".\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nHe was born in Madrid on 19 April 1832.[2] His father, a doctor and institute professor of Greek,[3] was from Aragon and his mother was from Navarra. He spent his childhood in Murcia, where he finished his elementary school education. It was there, at the Murcia Institute, where he first gained his love for mathematics. While still a child he read Goethe, Homer, and Balzac, readings that alternated with those of mathematicians like Gauss, Legendre, and Lagrange.\n\n\nIn order to earn enough money to attend the *Escuela T\u00e9cnica Superior de Ingenier\u00eda de Caminos, Canales y Puertos* (Engineering School of Roads, Channels and Ports), he moved at the age of fourteen to Madrid.[4] At the age of twenty, he left the Madrid School with a Civil Engineering degree, which he had obtained as first in his class, and he had to move to Almeria and Granada to begin working at his first job.[5]\n\n\n\n## Professor and scientist[edit]\n\n\nIn 1854 he began teaching a class at the Engineering School, working as a secretary there also. He taught mathematics, stereotomy, hydraulics, descriptive geometry, and differential and physical calculus from that year until 1868. From 1858 to 1860 he was also a professor at the Assistants' School of Public Works.\n\n\nHis *Problemas de geometr\u00eda anal\u00edtica* (1865) and *Teor\u00edas modernas de la f\u00edsica. Unidad de las fuerzas materiales* (1867) were held in some regard. He became a member of the Society of Political Economy, helped to found the magazine *La Revista*, and took a prominent part in propagating free trade doctrines in the press and on the platform.[5]\n\n\nHe was clearly marked out for office, and when the revolution of 1868 overthrew the monarchy, he resigned his post for a place in the revolutionary cabinet.[5]\n\n\n\n## Government service[edit]\n\n\nEchegaray also entered politics later in his life. As a founding member of the republican Radical Democratic Party,[6] he enjoyed a career in the government sector, being appointed Minister of Education, of Public Works and Finance Minister successively between 1867 and 1874.[3] He retired from politics after the Bourbon restoration in 1874.[5]\n\n\n\n## Literary career[edit]\n\n\nTheater had always been the love of Jos\u00e9 Echegaray's life. Although he had written earlier plays (*La Hija natural* and *La \u00daltima Noche*, both in 1867), he truly became a dramatist in 1874.[5] His plays reflected his sense of duty, which had made him famous during his time in the governmental offices. Dilemmas centered on duty and morality are the motif of his plays. He replicated the achievements of his predecessors of the Spanish Golden Age, remaining a prolific playwright.\n\n\nHis most famous play is *El gran Galeoto*, a drama written in the grand nineteenth century manner of melodrama. It is about the poisonous effect that unfounded gossip has on a middle-aged man's happiness. Echegaray filled it with elaborate stage instructions that illuminate what we would now consider a hammy style of acting popular in the 19th century. Paramount Pictures filmed it as a silent with the title changed to *The World and His Wife*, and it was the basis for a later film The Great Galeoto. His most remarkable plays[*citation needed*] are *O locura o santidad* (Saint or Madman?, 1877); *Mariana* (1892); *El estigma* (1895); *La duda*, 1898; and *El loco Dios* (God, the fool, 1900).\n\n\nAmong his other famous plays are *La esposa del vengador* (1874) (The Avenger's Wife); *En el pu\u00f1o de la espada* (1875) (In the Sword's Handle); *En el pilar y en la cruz* (1878) (On the Stake and on the Cross); and *Conflicto entre dos deberes* (1882) (Conflict of Two Duties).[3]\n\n\nAlong with the Proven\u00e7al poet Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mistral, he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1904, after having been nominated that year by a member of the Royal Spanish Academy, making him the first Spaniard to win the prize.[7]\n\n\n\n![](image)Jos\u00e9 Echegaray\nJos\u00e9 Echegaray maintained constant activity until his death on 14 September 1916 in Madrid.[2] His extensive work did not stop growing in his old age: in the final stage of his life he wrote 25 or 30 mathematical physics volumes. At the age of 83 he commented: \n\n\n> I cannot die, because if I am going to write my mathematical physics encyclopedia, I need at least 25 more years.\n> \n> \n\n\n## Honors[edit]\n\n\nSeveral streets in Spain are named after Jos\u00e9 Echegaray. *Calle Echegaray* in Madrid's *Barrio de las Letras* is especially noteworthy.[8][9] In 1971 the Bank of Spain issued a 1000-peseta banknote in his honor.[10]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Burell was elected for the position in 1916 but never took the seat\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Jos\u00e9 Echegaray y Eizaguirre - Spanish dramatist\". *Britannica.com*.

They shared the prize money equally.[5] Mistral devoted his half to the creation of the Museum at Arles, known locally as \"Museon Arlaten\". The museum is considered to be the most important collection of Proven\u00e7al folk art, displaying furniture, costumes, ceramics, tools and farming implements. In addition, Mistral was awarded the L\u00e9gion d'honneur. This was a most unusual occurrence since it is usually only awarded for notable achievement on a national level, whereas Mistral was uniquely Proven\u00e7al in his work and achievement.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* 1980: Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz\n |\n| 1981\u20132000 | * 1981: Elias Canetti\n* 1982: Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez\n* 1983: William Golding\n* 1984: Jaroslav Seifert\n* 1985: Claude Simon\n* 1986: Wole Soyinka\n* 1987: Joseph Brodsky\n* 1988: Naguib Mahfouz\n* 1989: Camilo Jos\u00e9 Cela\n* 1990: Octavio Paz\n* 1991: Nadine Gordimer\n* 1992: Derek Walcott\n* 1993: Toni Morrison\n* 1994: Kenzabur\u014d \u014ce\n* 1995: Seamus Heaney\n* 1996: Wis\u0142awa Szymborska\n* 1997: Dario Fo\n* 1998: Jos\u00e9 Saramago\n* 1999: G\u00fcnter Grass\n* 2000: Gao Xingjian\n |\n| 2001\u20132020 | * 2001: V.

As early as 1471, his paternal ancestor, Mermet Mistral, lived in Maillane.[1] By 1588, the Mistral family lived in Saint-R\u00e9my-de-Provence.[1]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFrench Proven\u00e7al writer and lexicographer (1830\u20131914)\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t+ \"He who has seen Paris and not Cassis has seen nothing.\"\n\n\n## Works[edit]\n\n\n* *Mir\u00e8io* (1859) - PDF (in Proven\u00e7al)\n* *Calendau* (1867) - online\n* *Lis Isclo d\u2019or* (1875) - en ligne\u00a0: part I, part II\n* *Nerto*, short story (1884) - online\n* *La R\u00e8ino Jano*, drama (1890) - en ligne\n* *Lou Pou\u00e8mo d\u00f3u Rose* (1897) - online\n* *Moun espelido, Mem\u00f2ri e Raconte* (Mes m\u00e9moires) (1906) - online\n* *Discours e dicho* (1906) - online\n* *La Gen\u00e8si, traducho en prouven\u00e7au* (1910) - online\n* *Lis \u00f3ulivado* (1912) - online\n* *Lou Tresor d\u00f3u Felibrige ou Dictionnaire proven\u00e7al-fran\u00e7ais embrassant les divers dialectes de la langue d'oc moderne* (1878\u20131886) - online\n* *Proso d\u2019Armana* (posthume) (1926, 1927, 1930) - online\n* *Coupo Santo* (1867)\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* The works of Antonin Merci\u00e9\n* List of works by Louis Botinelly\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMistral is the author of *Lou Tresor d\u00f3u F\u00e9librige* (1878\u20131886), which to date remains the most comprehensive dictionary of the Occitan language, and one of the most reliable, thanks to the precision of its definitions. It is a bilingual dictionary, Occitan-French, in two large volumes, with all of the dialects of *oc*, including Proven\u00e7al. Mistral owes to Fran\u00e7ois Vidal the work of typesetting and revising that dictionary.\n\n\n\n## *Mir\u00e8io* \u2013 *Mireille*[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mistral during his career.\nMistral's most important work is *Mir\u00e8io* (*Mireille*), published in 1859, after eight years of effort. *Mir\u00e8io*, a long poem in Proven\u00e7al consisting of twelve songs, tells of the thwarted love of Vincent and Mireille, two young Proven\u00e7al people of different social backgrounds. The name Mireille (Mir\u00e8io in Provence) is a doublet of the word *meraviho* which means wonder.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter receiving his bachelor's degree in N\u00eemes, Mistral studied law in Aix-en-Provence from 1848 to 1851. He became a champion for the independence of Provence, and in particular for restoring the \"first literary language of civilized Europe\"\u2014Proven\u00e7al. He had studied the history of Provence during his time in Aix-en-Provence. Emancipated by his father, Mistral resolved: \"to raise, revive in Provence the feeling of race ...; to move this rebirth by the restoration of the natural and historical language of the country ...; to restore the fashion to Provence by the breath and flame of divine poetry\". For Mistral, the word race designates \"people linked by language, rooted in a country and in a story\".\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe seven founders of the organization were (to use their Proven\u00e7al names): J\u00f3us\u00e8 Roumaniho, Frederi Mistral, Teodor Aubanel, Ans\u00e8ume Mati\u00e9u, Jan Brunet, Anfos Tavan and Paul Giera. F\u00e9librige exists to this day, one of the few remaining cultural organizations in 32 departments of the \"Langue d'Oc\".\n\n\nMistral strove to rehabilitate the language of Provence, while carrying it to the highest summits of epic poetry. He redefined the language in its purest form by creating a dictionary and transcribing the songs of the troubadours, who spoke the language in its original form.\n\n\n\n## Lexicography: *Lou Tresor d\u00f3u Felibrige*[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTo you, I dedicate Mireille:\nIt is my heart and my soul;\nIt is the flower of my years;\nIt is bunch of grapes from La Crau, leaves and all, a peasant's offering.\"\n\n\nLamartine wrote enthusiastically: \"I will tell you good news today! A great epic poet is born ... A true Homeric poet in our time; ... Yes, your epic poem is a masterpiece; ... the perfume of your book will not evaporate in a thousand years.\"\n\n\n*Mir\u00e8io* was translated into some fifteen European languages, including into French by Mistral himself.

Among other tales, he tells of Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer, where according to legend the dragon Tarasque was driven out, and of the famous and ancient Venus of Arles. He prefaced the poem with a short notice about Proven\u00e7al pronunciation.\n\n\nThe poem tells how Mireille's parents wish her to marry a Proven\u00e7al landowner, but she falls in love with a poor basket maker named Vincent, who loves her as well. After rejecting three rich suitors, a desperate Mireille, driven by the refusal of her parents to let her marry Vincent, runs off to Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer to pray to the patrons of Provence to change her parents' minds. Having forgotten to bring a hat, she falls victim to the heat, dying in Vincent's arms under the gaze of her parents.\n\n\nMistral dedicated his book to Alphonse de Lamartine as follows:\n\n\n\"To Lamartine:\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | You can help **expand this article with text translated from the corresponding article in Polish and French**. *(December 2021)* Click [show] for important translation instructions.\n* \n* Machine translation, like DeepL or Google Translate, is a useful starting point for translations, but translators must revise errors as necessary and confirm that the translation is accurate, rather than simply copy-pasting machine-translated text into the English Wikipedia.\n* Do not translate text that appears unreliable or low-quality.

Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mistral (1830-1914) was a French writer who wrote in Occitan literature and was a lexicographer of the Proven\u00e7al form of the language. He shared the 1904 Nobel Prize in Literature with Jos\u00e9 Echegaray.\n\nKey points about Mistral and the 1904 Nobel Prize:\n\n1. He received the prize \"in recognition of the fresh originality and true inspiration of his poetic production, which faithfully reflects the natural scenery and native spirit of his people, and, in addition, his significant work as a Proven\u00e7al philologist.\"\n\n2. He was nominated by two professors from the Swedish Uppsala University.\n\n3. He shared the prize money equally with Jos\u00e9 Echegaray, who was honored for his Spanish dramas.\n\n4. Mistral devoted his half of the prize money to the creation of the Museum at Arles, known locally as \"Museon Arlaten,\" which became the most important collection of Proven\u00e7al folk art, displaying furniture, costumes, ceramics, tools and farming implements.\n\nMistral was particularly notable for his efforts to restore and promote the Proven\u00e7al language. His major works included:\n- \"Mir\u00e8io\" (1859) - his most important work, a long poem about thwarted love\n- \"Lou Tresor d\u00f3u F\u00e9librige\" (1878-1886) - a comprehensive bilingual Occitan-French dictionary\n- He was also a founding member of F\u00e9librige, a literary and cultural association promoting the Occitan language.\n\nIn addition to the Nobel Prize, Mistral was also awarded the L\u00e9gion d'honneur, which was unusual as it was typically only awarded for national achievements, while Mistral's work was specifically focused on Provence.",

He was awarded the 1904 Nobel Prize in Literature \"in recognition of the numerous and brilliant compositions which, in an individual and original manner, have revived the great traditions of the Spanish drama\".\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nHe was born in Madrid on 19 April 1832.[2] His father, a doctor and institute professor of Greek,[3] was from Aragon and his mother was from Navarra. He spent his childhood in Murcia, where he finished his elementary school education. It was there, at the Murcia Institute, where he first gained his love for mathematics. While still a child he read Goethe, Homer, and Balzac, readings that alternated with those of mathematicians like Gauss, Legendre, and Lagrange.\n\n\nIn order to earn enough money to attend the *Escuela T\u00e9cnica Superior de Ingenier\u00eda de Caminos, Canales y Puertos* (Engineering School of Roads, Channels and Ports), he moved at the age of fourteen to Madrid.[4] At the age of twenty, he left the Madrid School with a Civil Engineering degree, which he had obtained as first in his class, and he had to move to Almeria and Granada to begin working at his first job.[5]\n\n\n\n## Professor and scientist[edit]\n\n\nIn 1854 he began teaching a class at the Engineering School, working as a secretary there also. He taught mathematics, stereotomy, hydraulics, descriptive geometry, and differential and physical calculus from that year until 1868. From 1858 to 1860 he was also a professor at the Assistants' School of Public Works.\n\n\nHis *Problemas de geometr\u00eda anal\u00edtica* (1865) and *Teor\u00edas modernas de la f\u00edsica. Unidad de las fuerzas materiales* (1867) were held in some regard. He became a member of the Society of Political Economy, helped to found the magazine *La Revista*, and took a prominent part in propagating free trade doctrines in the press and on the platform.[5]\n\n\nHe was clearly marked out for office, and when the revolution of 1868 overthrew the monarchy, he resigned his post for a place in the revolutionary cabinet.[5]\n\n\n\n## Government service[edit]\n\n\nEchegaray also entered politics later in his life. As a founding member of the republican Radical Democratic Party,[6] he enjoyed a career in the government sector, being appointed Minister of Education, of Public Works and Finance Minister successively between 1867 and 1874.[3] He retired from politics after the Bourbon restoration in 1874.[5]\n\n\n\n## Literary career[edit]\n\n\nTheater had always been the love of Jos\u00e9 Echegaray's life. Although he had written earlier plays (*La Hija natural* and *La \u00daltima Noche*, both in 1867), he truly became a dramatist in 1874.[5] His plays reflected his sense of duty, which had made him famous during his time in the governmental offices. Dilemmas centered on duty and morality are the motif of his plays. He replicated the achievements of his predecessors of the Spanish Golden Age, remaining a prolific playwright.\n\n\nHis most famous play is *El gran Galeoto*, a drama written in the grand nineteenth century manner of melodrama. It is about the poisonous effect that unfounded gossip has on a middle-aged man's happiness. Echegaray filled it with elaborate stage instructions that illuminate what we would now consider a hammy style of acting popular in the 19th century. Paramount Pictures filmed it as a silent with the title changed to *The World and His Wife*, and it was the basis for a later film The Great Galeoto. His most remarkable plays[*citation needed*] are *O locura o santidad* (Saint or Madman?, 1877); *Mariana* (1892); *El estigma* (1895); *La duda*, 1898; and *El loco Dios* (God, the fool, 1900).\n\n\nAmong his other famous plays are *La esposa del vengador* (1874) (The Avenger's Wife); *En el pu\u00f1o de la espada* (1875) (In the Sword's Handle); *En el pilar y en la cruz* (1878) (On the Stake and on the Cross); and *Conflicto entre dos deberes* (1882) (Conflict of Two Duties).[3]\n\n\nAlong with the Proven\u00e7al poet Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mistral, he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1904, after having been nominated that year by a member of the Royal Spanish Academy, making him the first Spaniard to win the prize.[7]\n\n\n\n![](image)Jos\u00e9 Echegaray\nJos\u00e9 Echegaray maintained constant activity until his death on 14 September 1916 in Madrid.[2] His extensive work did not stop growing in his old age: in the final stage of his life he wrote 25 or 30 mathematical physics volumes. At the age of 83 he commented: \n\n\n> I cannot die, because if I am going to write my mathematical physics encyclopedia, I need at least 25 more years.\n> \n> \n\n\n## Honors[edit]\n\n\nSeveral streets in Spain are named after Jos\u00e9 Echegaray. *Calle Echegaray* in Madrid's *Barrio de las Letras* is especially noteworthy.[8][9] In 1971 the Bank of Spain issued a 1000-peseta banknote in his honor.[10]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Burell was elected for the position in 1916 but never took the seat\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Jos\u00e9 Echegaray y Eizaguirre - Spanish dramatist\". *Britannica.com*.

In the late 1870s he traveled to the United States, sending back travel essays that won him popularity with Polish readers. In the 1880s he began serializing novels that further increased his popularity. He soon became one of the most popular Polish writers of the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries, and numerous translations gained him international renown, culminating in his receipt of the 1905 Nobel Prize in Literature for his \"outstanding merits as an epic writer.\"\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Nobel laureate, 1905\nSienkiewicz maintained some ties with Polish right-wing National Democracy politicians and was critical of the socialists, but he was generally a moderate and declined to become a politician and a deputy to the Russian Duma.[21][22] In the cultural sphere, he was involved in the creation of the Krak\u00f3w and Warsaw monuments to Adam Mickiewicz.[19] He supported educational endeavors and co-founded the Polska Macierz Szkolna organization.[22] \"Reasonably wealthy\" by 1908 thanks to sales of his books, he often used his new wealth to support struggling writers.[19] He helped gather funds for social-welfare projects such as starvation relief, and for construction of a tuberculosis sanatorium at Zakopane.[19] He was as prominent in philanthropy as in literature.[5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSienkiewicz received 15,000 rubles, in recognition of his achievements, from an unknown admirer who signed himself \"Micha\u0142 Wo\u0142odyjowski\" after the Trilogy character.[17] Sienkiewicz used the money to set up a fund, named for his wife and supervised by the Academy of Learning, to aid artists endangered by tuberculosis.[17]\n\n\nIn 1886, he visited Istanbul; in 1888, Spain.[17] At the end of 1890 he went to Africa, resulting in *Listy z Afryki* (Letters from Africa, published in *The Word* in 1891\u201392, then collected as a book in 1893).[17] The turn of the 1880s and 1890s was associated with intensive work on several novels. In 1891 his novel *Without dogma* (*Bez Dogmatu*), previously serialized in 1889\u201390 in *The Word*, was published in book form.[18] In 1892 Sienkiewicz signed an agreement for another novel, Rodzina Po\u0142anieckich (Children of the Soil), which was serialized in *The Polish Gazette* from 1893 and came out in book form in 1894.[18]\n\n\n\n### Later years\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 2021\u2013present | * 2021: Abdulrazak Gurnah\n* 2022: Annie Ernaux\n* 2023: Jon Fosse\n* 2024: Han Kang\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n1905 Nobel Prize laureates\n |\n| --- |\n| Chemistry | * Adolf von Baeyer (Germany)\n |\n| Literature (1905) | * Henryk Sienkiewicz (Poland)\n |\n| Peace | * Bertha von Suttner (Austria-Hungary)\n |\n| Physics | * Philipp Lenard (Germany)\n |\n| Physiology or Medicine | * Robert Koch (Germany)\n |\n| Nobel Prize recipients\n1901\n1902\n1903\n1904\n**1905** \n1906\n1907\n1908\n1909\n1910\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nHenryk Sienkiewicz's *Quo Vadis*\n |\n| --- |\n| Characters | * Gaius Petronius\n* Nero\n* Tigellinus\n* Poppaea Sabina\n* Acte\n* Aulus Plautius\n* Pomponia Graecina\n* Ursus\n* Saint Peter\n* Saint Paul\n |\n| Adaptations | * *Quo Vadis?* (1913)\n* *Quo Vadis* (1924)\n* *Quo Vadis* (1951)\n* *Quo Vadis?* (TV, 1985)\n* *Quo Vadis* (2001)\n |\n| Related | * *The Sign of the Cross*\n* Quo vadis?\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nHenryk Sienkiewicz's Trilogy\n |\n| --- |\n| *With Fire and Sword* | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n40. **^** \"Muzeum Henryka Sienkiewicza w Woli Okrzejskiej\".
