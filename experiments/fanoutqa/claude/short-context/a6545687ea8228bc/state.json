Until 2016, the championship winners could compete in the following year's FIFA Confederations Cup, but were not obliged to do so.[3] From the 2020 edition onwards, the winner competes in the CONMEBOL\u2013UEFA Cup of Champions.\n\n\nThe sixteen European Championship tournaments have been won by ten national teams: Germany and Spain have each won three titles, Italy and France have won two titles, and the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, the Netherlands, Denmark, Greece and Portugal have won one title each. To date, Spain is the only team to have won consecutive titles, doing so in 2008 and 2012.\n\n\nThe most recent championship, held across Europe in 2021 (postponed from 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic), was won by Italy, who lifted their second European title after beating England in the final at Wembley Stadium in London on penalties.[4][5]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Beginnings[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| * UEFA men's club competitions\n\t+ Records and statistics\n\t+ Winning teams\n\t+ Winning managers\n\t+ UEFA coefficient\n* FENIX Trophy\n* Policies\n\t+ Bosman ruling\n\t+ Coaching licences\n\t+ Financial Fair Play Regulations\n\t+ Homegrown Player Rule\n\t+ Respect campaign\n\t+ Stadium categories\n* Issues\n\t+ Proposals for a European Super League\n\t+ UEFA\u2013CONMEBOL memorandum of understanding\n\t+ 2009 European football match-fixing scandal\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nUEFA European Championship winners\n |\n| --- |\n| * **1960:** ![](image)\u00a0Soviet Union\n* **1964:** ![](image)\u00a0Spain\n* **1968:** ![](image)\u00a0Italy\n* **1972:** ![](image)\u00a0West Germany\n* **1976:** ![](image)\u00a0Czechoslovakia\n* **1980:** ![](image)\u00a0West Germany\n* **1984:** ![](image)\u00a0France\n* **1988:** ![](image)\u00a0Netherlands\n* **1992:** ![](image)\u00a0Denmark\n* **1996:** ![](image)\u00a0Germany\n* **2000:** ![](image)\u00a0France\n* **2004:** ![](image)\u00a0Greece\n* **2008:** ![](image)\u00a0Spain\n* **2012:** ![](image)\u00a0Spain\n* **2016:** ![](image)\u00a0Portugal\n* **2020:** ![](image)\u00a0Italy\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n## Summary[edit]\n\n\nSee also: UEFA European Championship records and statistics \u00a7\u00a0Comprehensive team results by tournament\n\n![](image)Map of winners\n\n\n| Team\n | Winners\n | Runners-up\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Germany1 | 3 (1972, 1980, 1996)\n | 3 (1976, 1992, 2008)\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Spain | 3 (1964\\*, 2008, 2012)\n | 1 (1984)\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Italy | 2 (1968\\*, 2020\\*)\n | 2 (2000, 2012)\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0France | 2 (1984\\*, 2000)\n | 1 (2016\\*)\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Russia2 | 1 (1960)\n | 3 (1964, 1972, 1988)\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Czech Republic3 | 1 (1976)\n | 1 (1996)\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Portugal | 1 (2016)\n | 1 (2004\\*)\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Netherlands | 1 (1988)\n | \u2014\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Denmark | 1 (1992)\n | \u2014\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Greece | 1 (2004)\n | \u2014\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Serbia4 | \u2014\n | 2 (1960, 1968)\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Belgium | \u2014\n | 1 (1980)\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0England | \u2014\n | 1 (2020\\*)\n |\n\n\n\\* *hosts*\n\n1 *named West Germany until 1990*\n\n2 *includes results representing the Soviet Union and CIS*\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nUEFA European Championship\n |\n| --- |\n| Tournaments | * France 1960\n* Spain 1964\n* Italy 1968\n* Belgium 1972\n* Yugoslavia 1976\n* Italy 1980\n* France 1984\n* West Germany 1988\n* Sweden 1992\n* England 1996\n* Belgium / Netherlands 2000\n* Portugal 2004\n* Austria / Switzerland 2008\n* Poland / Ukraine 2012\n* France 2016\n* Pan-European 2020\u2020\n* *Germany 2024*\n* *United Kingdom / Ireland 2028*\n* *Italy / Turkey 2032*\n |\n| Qualifying | * 1960\n* 1964\n* 1968\n* 1972\n* 1976\n* 1980\n* 1984\n* 1988\n* 1992\n* 1996\n* 2000\n* 2004\n* 2008\n* 2012\n* 2016\n* 2020\n* 2024\n |\n| Finals | * 1960\n* 1964\n* 1968\n* 1972\n* 1976\n* 1980\n* 1984\n* 1988\n* 1992\n* 1996\n* 2000\n* 2004\n* 2008\n* 2012\n* 2016\n* 2020\n* 2024\n |\n| Squads | * 1960\n* 1964\n* 1968\n* 1972\n* 1976\n* 1980\n* 1984\n* 1988\n* 1992\n* 1996\n* 2000\n* 2004\n* 2008\n* 2012\n* 2016\n* 2020\n* 2024\n |\n| Bids | * 2004\n* 2008\n* 2012\n* 2016\n* 2020\n* 2024\n* 2028\n* 2032\n |\n| Statistics | * 1992\n* 1996\n* 2000\n* 2004\n* 2008\n* 2012\n* 2016\n* 2020\n |\n| Broadcasting rights | * 2000\n* 2004\n* 2008\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n79. **^** \"Uefa to expand Euro Championship\". *BBC Sport*.

The competition is contested by UEFA members' senior men's national teams, determining the continental champion of Europe. It is the second-most watched football tournament in the world after the FIFA World Cup. The Euro 2012 final was watched by a global audience of around 300 million.[2] The competition has been held every four years since 1960, except for 2020, when it was postponed until 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe, but kept the name Euro 2020. Scheduled to be in the even-numbered year between FIFA World Cup tournaments, it was originally called the **European Nations' Cup** before changing to its current name in 1968. Since 1996, the individual events have been branded as \"**UEFA Euro [year]**\".\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | 2008 | ![](image)\u00a0Austria![](image)\u00a0\u00a0Switzerland |\n| 14\n | 2012 | ![](image)\u00a0Poland![](image)\u00a0Ukraine |\n| 15\n | 2016 | ![](image)\u00a0France | 24\n | 51\n | 6 groups of 4 teams: 36 matches\n | knockout of 16 teams (round 1 group winners and runners-up, plus four best third-placed teams): 15 matches\n |\n| 16\n | 2020[s 1] | ![](image)\u00a0Europe[s 2] |\n| *17* | *2024* | *![](image)\u00a0Germany* |\n| *18* | *2028* | *![](image)\u00a0England![](image)\u00a0Northern Ireland![](image)\u00a0Republic of Ireland![](image)\u00a0Scotland![](image)\u00a0Wales* |\n| *19* | *2032* | *![](image)\u00a0Italy![](image)\u00a0Turkey* |\n\n\n1. **^** Postponed to 2021 due to the\u00a0COVID-19 pandemic in Europe\n2. **^** Pan\u2013European edition hosted by eleven countries: Azerbaijan, Denmark, England, Germany, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Romania, Russia, Scotland and Spain\n\nUp to 1968 draws were to be broken via a coin toss in all matches but the final, draw in final match was resolved via a replay.\n\n\nNo third place play-off has been played since 1980.\n\n\n\n### Qualifying[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAssociation football tournament\n\nThis article is about the men's tournament.

After a 1\u20130 win against Norway in New York City and a 1\u20131 draw with Mexico at the RFK Stadium in Washington, D.C., Italy advanced from Group E based on goals scored among the four teams tied on points. During their round of 16 match at the Foxboro Stadium near Boston, Italy was down 0\u20131 late against Nigeria, but Baggio rescued Italy with an equaliser in the 88th minute and a penalty in extra time to take the win.[43] Baggio scored another late goal against Spain at their quarter-final match in Boston to seal a 2\u20131 win and two goals against Bulgaria in their semi-final match in New York City for another 2\u20131 win.[44][45]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMain articles: List of Italy national football team managers and Italy national football team records and statistics\n\nMost manager appearances\nEnzo Bearzot: 104[175]\n## Team records[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Italy national football team records and statistics\n\nLargest victory\n9\u20130 vs. **United States**, 2 August 1948\nLargest defeat\n1\u20137 vs. **Hungary**, 6 April 1924\n## Competitive record[edit]\n\n\n*For the all-time record, see Italy national football team all-time record.*\n\n\n\u00a0 **Champions**\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 **Runners-up**\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 **Third place**\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tournament played fully or partially on home soil\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n### FIFA World Cup[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Italy at the FIFA World Cup\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the 1930s, Italy wore a black kit, ordered by the fascist regime of Benito Mussolini. The black kit debuted on 17 February 1935 in a friendly against France at the Stadio Nazionale PNF in Rome.[157] A blue shirt, white shorts and black socks were worn at the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin the following year. At the 1938 FIFA World Cup in France, the all-black kit was worn once in the match against France.[158]\n\n\nAfter World War II, the fascist regime fell and the monarchy was abolished in 1946. The same year saw the birth of the Italian Republic, and the blue-and-white kit was reinstated. The cross of the former Royal House of Savoy was removed from the flag of Italy, and consequently from the national team's badge, now consisting solely of the *Tricolore*. For the 1954 FIFA World Cup, the country's name in Italian, *ITALIA*, was placed above the tricolour shield, and for the 1982 FIFA World Cup, *FIGC*, the abbreviation of the Italian Football Federation, was incorporated into the badge.[153]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 1 June 2022, Italy took part in the CONMEBOL\u2013UEFA Cup of Champions match, rebranded as the 2022 Finalissima, losing 3\u20130 against Argentina.[135] On 26 September, Italy qualified to the 2023 UEFA Nations League Finals after beating Hungary 2\u20130 in Budapest.[136] On 15 June 2023, Italy played the semi-final against Spain, losing 2\u20131.[137] Three days later, Italy won the third-place final 3\u20132 against the Netherlands.[138] Mancini's stay on Italy's bench ended a few months later following his resignation, with Luciano Spalletti being chosen in his place.[139][140]\n\n\n\n## Rivalries[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nItaly has notable rivalries with other footballing nations, such as Brazil, France, Germany and Spain.

The Commission took the role that a standard coach would currently play. Ever since 1967, the national team has been controlled only by the coach. For this reason, the coach of the Italy national team is still called *Technical Commissioner* (*Italian: *Commissario tecnico**) or *CT.* The use of this title has since then expanded into other team sports in Italy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAfter declining to participate in the inaugural World Cup (1930, in Uruguay) the Italy national team won two consecutive editions of the tournament in 1934 and 1938, under the direction of coach Vittorio Pozzo and the performance of Giuseppe Meazza, who is considered one of the best Italian football players of all time by some.[12][13] Italy hosted the 1934 World Cup, and played their first ever World Cup match in a 7\u20131 win over the United States in Rome. Italy defeated Czechoslovakia 2\u20131 in extra time in the final in Rome, with goals by Raimundo Orsi and Angelo Schiavio to achieve their first World cup title in 1934. They achieved their second title in 1938 in a 4\u20132 defeat of Hungary, with two goals by Gino Colaussi and two goals by Silvio Piola in the World Cup that followed. Rumour has it, before the 1938 finals fascist Italian Prime Minister Benito Mussolini was to have sent a telegram to the team, saying \"Vincere o morire!\" (literally translated as \"Win or die!\"). \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nItaly squad \u2013 2010 FIFA World Cup\n |\n| --- |\n| * 1\u00a0Buffon\n* 2\u00a0Maggio\n* 3\u00a0Criscito\n* 4\u00a0Chiellini\n* 5\u00a0Cannavaro\u00a0(c)\n* 6\u00a0De Rossi\n* 7\u00a0Pepe\n* 8\u00a0Gattuso\n* 9\u00a0Iaquinta\n* 10\u00a0Di Natale\n* 11\u00a0Gilardino\n* 12\u00a0Marchetti\n* 13\u00a0Bocchetti\n* 14\u00a0De Sanctis\n* 15\u00a0Marchisio\n* 16\u00a0Camoranesi\n* 17\u00a0Palombo\n* 18\u00a0Quagliarella\n* 19\u00a0Zambrotta\n* 20\u00a0Pazzini\n* 21\u00a0Pirlo\n* 22\u00a0Montolivo\n* 23\u00a0Bonucci\n* Coach:\u00a0Lippi\n | ![Italy](image)\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nItaly squad \u2013 2014 FIFA World Cup\n |\n| --- |\n| * 1\u00a0Buffon\u00a0(c)\n* 2\u00a0De Sciglio\n* 3\u00a0Chiellini\n* 4\u00a0Darmian\n* 5\u00a0Motta\n* 6\u00a0Candreva\n* 7\u00a0Abate\n* 8\u00a0Marchisio\n* 9\u00a0Balotelli\n* 10\u00a0Cassano\n* 11\u00a0Cerci\n* 12\u00a0Sirigu\n* 13\u00a0Perin\n* 14\u00a0Aquilani\n* 15\u00a0Barzagli\n* 16\u00a0De Rossi\n* 17\u00a0Immobile\n* 18\u00a0Parolo\n* 19\u00a0Bonucci\n* 20\u00a0Paletta\n* 21\u00a0Pirlo\n* 22\u00a0Insigne\n* 23\u00a0Verratti\n* Coach:\u00a0Prandelli\n | ![Italy](image)\n |\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

The capital city of Madrid (Bernab\u00e9u and Metropolitano), Seville (Pizju\u00e1n, La Cartuja and Villamar\u00edn), Valencia (Mestalla and Orriols) and Barcelona (Camp Nou and Montju\u00efc), are the four Spanish cities that have hosted more than 15 national team matches, while also being home to the largest stadiums in the country.[47]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe **Spain national football team** (Spanish: *Selecci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola de F\u00fatbol*) has represented Spain in men's international football competitions since 1920. It is governed by the Royal Spanish Football Federation, the governing body for football in Spain.\n\n\nSpain is one of eight national teams to have been crowned world champions and have participated in a total of 16 of 22 FIFA World Cups, also qualifying consistently since 1978. Spain have won three continental titles during their appearances of 11 out of 16 UEFA European Championships. Spain currently competes in League A of the UEFA Nations League alongside the other top teams of Europe. Their best result was in the 2022\u201323 season where they reached the final, winning against Croatia.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOther friendly matches, as well as qualifying fixtures against smaller opponents, are played in provincial stadia. The 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign included matches at the Reino de Le\u00f3n in Le\u00f3n,[48] Los C\u00e1rmenes in Granada,[49] El Molin\u00f3n in Gij\u00f3n,[50] and the Rico P\u00e9rez in Alicante.[51]\n\n\n\n### Media coverage[edit]\n\n\nSpain's UEFA European Qualifiers and UEFA Nations League matches, and all friendly games from 2018 until 2022, will be televised nationwide by La 1, flagship television channel of the public broadcaster TVE.[52]\n\n\n\n## Rivalries[edit]\n\n\nSpain has four main rivalries with other top footballing nations.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nSpain squad \u2013 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup runners-up\n |\n| --- |\n| * 1\u00a0Casillas (c)\n* 2\u00a0Albiol\n* 3\u00a0Piqu\u00e9\n* 4\u00a0Mart\u00ednez\n* 5\u00a0Azpilicueta\n* 6\u00a0Iniesta\n* 7\u00a0Villa\n* 8\u00a0Xavi\n* 9\u00a0Torres\n* 10\u00a0F\u00e0bregas\n* 11\u00a0Pedro\n* 12\u00a0Vald\u00e9s\n* 13\u00a0Mata\n* 14\u00a0Soldado\n* 15\u00a0Ramos\n* 16\u00a0Busquets\n* 17\u00a0Arbeloa\n* 18\u00a0Alba\n* 19\u00a0Monreal\n* 20\u00a0Cazorla\n* 21\u00a0Silva\n* 22\u00a0Navas\n* 23\u00a0Reina\n* Coach:\u00a0Del Bosque\n | ![Spain](image)\n |\n |\n |\n\n| Links to related articles\n |\n| --- |\n| | * v\n* t\n* e\nSpain national football team matches\n |\n| --- |\n| FIFA World Cup Final | * 2010\n |\n| UEFA European Championship Finals | * 1964\n* 1984\n* 2008\n* 2012\n |\n| UEFA Nations League Finals | * 2021\n* 2023\n |\n| FIFA Confederations Cup Final | * 2013\n |\n| Other matches | * Spain 4\u20133 England (1929)\n* Morocco v Spain (1961)\n* Spain 12\u20131 Malta (1983)\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n![Spain](image) Football in Spain\n |\n| --- |\n| * AFE\n* ANEF\n* CTA\n* CSD\n* TAD\n* COE\n* LaLiga\n* RFEF\n |\n| National teams | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n72. **^** Emlyn Begley (15 June 2023). \"Spain 2\u20131 Italy: Joselu winner sends La Roja to Nations League final\".

However, Spain only met Germany for the first time in any competitive fixture in 1966, as part of the 1966 FIFA World Cup, where Germany (known as West Germany at the time) came back to win 2\u20131.[60] However, since the unification of Germany in 1991, Spain has remained undefeated in competitive fixtures against Germany, including the famous 6\u20130 rout in the 2020\u201321 UEFA Nations League A.[61] Total head-to-head result however is slightly favourable for Germany with 9 wins, 9 draws compared to 8 wins by Spain.\n\n\n## Results and fixtures[edit]\n\n\nFor all past match results of the national team, see single-season articles, and Spain national football team results.\n\nFurther information: 2022\u201323 in Spanish football and 2023\u201324 in Spanish football\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe other most common nickname, known by fans, is \"*Los Toros*\" (*Fighting Bulls*), since Spanish Fighting Bull is one of Spain's famous national treasures and often used to define Spanish culture, and also often depicted by Spanish supporters alike.[33] The Spain football team is sometimes referred as the Bulls due to this cultural heritage.[34]\n\n\nThe Spanish team also received other nicknames, mostly \"*Toreros*\" or \"*Matador*\" (*Bullfighters* in Spanish), to describe its passionate and romantic style of football playing.[35]\n\n\n\n### Style of play[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tiki-taka\n\n![](image)Spain, UEFA Euro 2008 winners\n![](image)Spain's players celebrate winning the 2010 FIFA World Cup\n![](image)Spain, UEFA Euro 2012 winners\nBetween 2008 and 2012, the team played a style of football dubbed 'tiki-taka', a systems approach to football founded upon the ideal of team unity and a comprehensive understanding in the geometry of space on a football field.[36]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nSpain squad \u2013 2010 FIFA World Cup winners (1st title)\n |\n| --- |\n| * 1\u00a0Casillas (c)\n* 2\u00a0Albiol\n* 3\u00a0Piqu\u00e9\n* 4\u00a0Marchena\n* 5\u00a0Puyol\n* 6\u00a0Iniesta\n* 7\u00a0Villa\n* 8\u00a0Xavi\n* 9\u00a0Torres\n* 10\u00a0F\u00e0bregas\n* 11\u00a0Capdevila\n* 12\u00a0Vald\u00e9s\n* 13\u00a0Mata\n* 14\u00a0Alonso\n* 15\u00a0Ramos\n* 16\u00a0Busquets\n* 17\u00a0Arbeloa\n* 18\u00a0Pedro\n* 19\u00a0Llorente\n* 20\u00a0Mart\u00ednez\n* 21\u00a0Silva\n* 22\u00a0Navas\n* 23\u00a0Reina\n* Coach:\u00a0Del Bosque\n | ![Spain](image)\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nSpain squad \u2013 2014 FIFA World Cup\n |\n| --- |\n| * 1\u00a0Casillas (c)\n* 2\u00a0Albiol\n* 3\u00a0Piqu\u00e9\n* 4\u00a0Mart\u00ednez\n* 5\u00a0Juanfran\n* 6\u00a0Iniesta\n* 7\u00a0Villa\n* 8\u00a0Xavi\n* 9\u00a0Torres\n* 10\u00a0F\u00e0bregas\n* 11\u00a0Pedro\n* 12\u00a0De Gea\n* 13\u00a0Mata\n* 14\u00a0Alonso\n* 15\u00a0Ramos\n* 16\u00a0Busquets\n* 17\u00a0Koke\n* 18\u00a0Alba\n* 19\u00a0Costa\n* 20\u00a0Cazorla\n* 21\u00a0Silva\n* 22\u00a0Azpilicueta\n* 23\u00a0Reina\n* Coach:\u00a0Del Bosque\n | ![Spain](image)\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Association football portal\n* ![flag](image)Spain portal\n\n\n* Spain national under-23 football team (Olympic football team)\n* Spain national under-21 football team\n* Spain national under-20 football team\n* Spain national under-19 football team\n* Spain national under-18 football team\n* Spain national under-17 football team\n* Spain national under-16 football team\n* Spain national under-15 football team\n* Spain women's national football team\n* Spain women's national under-23 football team\n* Spain women's national under-20 football team\n* Spain women's national under-19 football team\n* Spain women's national under-17 football team\n* La Liga\n* Football in Spain\n* Sport in Spain\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n\n1. **^** Spanish players named in the *team of the tournament* were: goalkeeper and captain Iker Casillas; defenders Carles Puyol and Carlos Marchena; midfielders Xavi, Cesc F\u00e0bregas, Andr\u00e9s Iniesta and Marcos Senna; and strikers David Villa and Fernando Torres.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSpain has been a member of FIFA since its founding in 1904, even though the Spanish Football Federation was first established in 1909. The first Spain national football team was constituted in 1920, with the main objective of finding a team that would represent Spain at the 1920 Summer Olympics held in Belgium in that same year. Spain made their debut at the tournament on 28 August 1920 against Denmark, silver medalists at the last two Olympic tournaments. Spain managed to win that match by a scoreline of 1\u20130, eventually finishing with the silver medal.[12] Spain qualified for their first FIFA World Cup in 1934, defeating Brazil in their first game and losing in a replay to the hosts and eventual champions Italy in the quarter-finals.[13] The Spanish Civil War and World War II prevented Spain from playing any competitive matches between the 1934 World Cup and the 1950 edition's qualifiers. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSpain's kit is traditionally a red jersey with yellow trim, dark blue shorts and black socks, whilst their current away kit is all predominantly white. The colour of the socks altered throughout the 1990s from black to the same blue colour as the shorts, matching either the blue of the shorts or the red of the shirt until the mid-2010s when they returned to their traditional black. Spain's kits have been produced by manufacturers including Adidas (from 1981 until 1983), Le Coq Sportif (from 1983 until 1991) and Adidas once again (since 1991). Rather than displaying the logo of the Spanish football federation, Spain's jersey traditionally features the country's coat of arms over the left side. After winning the 2010 World Cup, the World Cup winners badge was added to the right side of the jersey and a golden star at the top of Spain's coat of arms.\n\n\n\n#### Kit suppliers[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nSpain squad \u2013 2002 FIFA World Cup\n |\n| --- |\n| * 1\u00a0Casillas\n* 2\u00a0C.

Their first home match away from it was played at the Nikos Goumas Stadium in 1962, while the Karaiskakis Stadium was used for the first time in 1964, when it was renovated. In 1966, Kaftanzoglio Stadium in Thessaloniki became the first stadium outside of the Athens area to be used. Since then all of these stadiums were alternately used until the early 1980s, while a few other stadiums were inaugurated by the national team as well such as Thessaloniki's Toumba Stadium and Harilaou Stadium in 1975 and 1977 respectively. Greece also held matches at other home grounds outside of the two major cities in 1976, such as Panachaiki Stadium in Patras and Kavala Stadium in Kavala. In 1982, Georgios Kamaras Stadium was added to the list of home grounds for the national team, the first in Athens out of the three major stadiums.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn 16 November 1983, the newly built Athens Olympic Stadium, to date the largest stadium in the country, housed the national team for the first time in a qualifier for UEFA Euro 1984 against Denmark. It served as the primary home ground for the team for the rest of the 1980s and the 1990s, until 2001 when it was closed for renovations. Meanwhile, a large number of matches were held in various stadiums including old choices and some new in provincial cities all over the country, something that did not change until the early 2000s, when the Athens Olympic Stadium was almost abandoned. From the start of the 2000 until the qualifiers games of Euro 2004, the Greek National Team uses Leoforos Stadium as its home. Since 2004 Greece has mainly used Karaiskakis Stadium, with very few of Greece's matches being played in other stadiums. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe **Greece national football team** (Greek: \u0395\u03b8\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac\u03b4\u03b1\u03c2, *Ethniki Elladas*) represents Greece in men's international football matches, and is controlled by the Hellenic Football Federation, the governing body for football in Greece. Starting in 2023, Greece play their home matches in Nea Filadelfeia, a suburb of Athens, at the newly built Agia Sophia Stadium. Greece is one of only ten national teams to have been crowned UEFA European Champions.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThey returned to OAKA in 2018 for a friendly against Switzerland and announced they would play their home matches for the new UEFA Nations League there, as well.[52] For the UEFA Euro 2020 qualifiers, they were slated to split time between OAKA in Athens, and the Pankritio Stadium in Heraklion on the island of Crete, but with the latter requiring upgrades to be fit for FIFA standards, the entire campaign was held in Athens. They remained at OAKA until 2021, before making a temporary move to the Georgios Kamaras Stadium in late 2021 for the UEFA Nations League campaign, also hosting two matches in Volos.\n\n\nOn 7 March 2023, it was announced that the new Agia Sophia Stadium in the Nea Filadelfeia section of Athens would become the new home of the Ethniki.\n\n\n\n## Team image[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Greece national football team kits.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nGreece national football team\n |\n| --- |\n| General topics | * Hellenic Football Federation\n* History\n* Managers\n |\n| Venues | * Leoforos Alexandras Stadium (until 1982)\n* Olympic Stadium (1982\u20132004)\n* Karaiskakis Stadium (2004\u20132017)\n* Panthessaliko Stadium (2017\u20132022)\n* OPAP Arena (2022\u2013present)\n* List of football stadiums in Greece\n |\n| Results | * 1929\u201359\n* 1960\u201379\n* 1980\u201399\n* 2000\u201319\n* 2020\u2013present\n |\n| Players | * List of Greece international footballers\n* World Cup & Euro Championship squads\n* Other footballers\n* Hat-tricks\n |\n| FIFA World Cup tournaments | * Summary\n* 1994\n* 2010\n* 2014\n |\n| UEFA Euro tournaments | * Summary\n* 1980\n* **2004**\n* 2008\n* 2012\n |\n| FIFA Confed Cup tournaments | * Summary\n* 2005\n |\n| Matches | * UEFA Euro 2004 final\n* Faroe Islands v Greece (2014\u201315)\n |\n| Rivalries | * Turkey\n |\n| Other HFF teams | * U-21\n* U-20\n* U-19\n* U-17\n* Olympic team\n* \u0392each soccer\n* Futsal\n* Women\n* Military\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n47. **^** \"Greece v Colombia\". *ESPN.com*. 14 June 2014.

Although blue was used as the home kit since the team's inception, white became the primary home color following UEFA Euro 2004. In recent decades, Greece wear either a set of white jerseys, shorts and socks, or an all-blue combination. Formerly, the kit consisted of a combination of blue jerseys and white shorts and vice versa. Meanwhile, Greece's kit has occasionally featured stripes, crosses or other designs, as well as various values of blue.\n\n\nOn 10 April 2013, the Hellenic Football Federation announced a partnership with American manufacturer Nike, which is Greece's current official supplier, with their first kit debuting on 7 June 2013 in the away match to Lithuania.[53][54] On 4 March 2014, Greece unveiled their latest kit also worn at the 2014 FIFA World Cup.[55]\n\n\nThe crest (*\u03b5\u03b8\u03bd\u03cc\u03c3\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf* means \"national sign\"),[56] which is used in the kit, is the official emblem of the national team.[57]\n\n\n\n### Kit sponsorship[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Greece national team in 2013\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n55. **^** \"Greece unveils 2014 national team kit with Nike\".

This match is recognized as their first official match by FIFA.[7] Notable figures during these years was Giorgos Kalafatis, player and later manager of the team, and Giannis Andrianopoulos.\n\n\nThe Greece national team's first official match came on 7 April 1929 in a 1\u20134 loss to Italy B, with Alvertos Nahmias being the author of the nation's first-ever official goal.[8]\n\n\n\n### 1930s Balkan Cups[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 24 March 2023 UEFA Euro 2024 qualifying |  **Gibraltar\u00a0![](image)**  | **0\u20133** |  **![](image)\u00a0Greece**  | Faro/Loul\u00e9, Portugal |\n| 20:45 |  | Report | * Masouras ![](image) 11'\n* Siopis ![](image) 45'\n* Bakasetas ![](image) 58'\n | Stadium: Est\u00e1dio AlgarveAttendance: 390Referee: Rohit Saggi (Norway) |\nGreece\u00a0![](image) v ![](image)\u00a0Lithuania\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 27 March 2023 Friendly |  **Greece\u00a0![](image)**  | **0\u20130** |  **![](image)\u00a0Lithuania**  | Nea Filadelfeia, Greece |\n| 18:00\u00a0UTC+2 |  | Report |  | Stadium: Agia Sofia (OPAP Arena)Attendance: 11,950Referee: Jonathan Lardot (Belgium) |\nGreece\u00a0![](image) v ![](image)\u00a0Republic of Ireland\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 13 October 2023 UEFA Euro 2024 qualifying |  **Republic of Ireland\u00a0![](image)**  | **0\u20132** |  **![](image)\u00a0Greece**  | Dublin, Republic of Ireland |\n| 19:45 UTC+1 |  | Report | * Giakoumakis ![](image) 20'\n* Masouras ![](image) 45+4'\n | Stadium: Aviva StadiumAttendance: 41,239Referee: Glenn Nyberg (Sweden) |\n\nGreece\u00a0![](image) v ![](image)\u00a0Netherlands\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 16 October 2023 UEFA Euro 2024 qualifying |  **Greece\u00a0![](image)**  | **0\u20131** |  **![](image)\u00a0Netherlands**  | Nea Filadelfeia, Greece |\n| 21:45 UTC+3 |  | Report | * Van Dijk ![](image) 90+3'\u00a0(pen.)\n | Stadium: Agia Sofia (OPAP Arena)Attendance: 24,967Referee: Alejandro Hern\u00e1ndez Hern\u00e1ndez (Spain) |\n\nGreece\u00a0![](image) v ![](image)\u00a0New Zealand\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Its seating capacity of 80,698 makes it the largest stadium in France. The stadium is used by the French national football and rugby union teams for international competitions. It is the largest in Europe for track and field events, seating 78,338 in that configuration. During other events, the stadium's running track is mostly hidden under the football pitch. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFFR had to move two of its 2010\u201311 home Tests to Montpellier and Nantes due to fixture clashes with the national football team.[44] Also, former FFR president Serge Blanco claimed that the 2009 Top 14 final had to be moved from May to June because of a conflict with a Johnny Hallyday rock concert.[43]\n\n\nIn June 2012, FFR announced that it had selected the site for its new ground, tentatively known as Grand Stade FFR.[46] The 82,000-seat stadium, featuring a retractable roof and slide-out pitch, was to be built on a former horse racing track in \u00c9vry, about 25\u00a0km (16\u00a0mi) south of Paris. The new stadium, estimated to cost \u20ac600 million, was originally scheduled to open in 2017,[44] but completion was later pushed back to the 2021/2022 time frame.[47] FFR officially abandoned the stadium project in December 2016.[48]\n\n\n\n## Access[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe stadium was inaugurated on 28 January 1998 as it hosted a football match between France and Spain. The match was played in front of 78,368 spectators, which included President Jacques Chirac, with France winning the match 1\u20130 with Zinedine Zidane scoring the lone goal, and the first-ever in the Stade de France, in the 20th minute.[7] Six months later, France returned to the stadium and defeated Brazil in the 1998 FIFA World Cup Final to earn their first World Cup title. Stade de France has hosted group, quarter-final, semi-final and the final match of 1998 FIFA World Cup.[8] The national rugby team's first match in the facility was contested five days after its opening, on 2 February, with France earning a 24\u201317 win over England in front of 77,567 spectators.[9] Philippe Bernat-Salles converted the first ever try at the stadium scoring it in the 11th minute of play.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nStade de France| ![](image) |\n| ![](image)**UEFA** ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)\n |\n| ![Map](image) |\n| Full name | Stade de France |\n| Address | Porte H - Avenue Jules Rimet, 93200Saint-DenisFrance |\n| Location | ZAC du Cornillon Nord Saint-Denis, \u00cele-de-France, France |\n| Coordinates | 48\u00b055\u203228\u2033N 2\u00b021\u203237\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff48.9245\u00b0N 2.3602\u00b0E\ufeff / 48.9245; 2.3602 |\n| Public transit | ![](image) ![Paris M\u00e9tro Line 13](image) Saint-Denis \u2013 Porte de Paris![](image) ![RER D](image) Stade de France \u2013 Saint-Denis![](image) ![RER B](image) La Plaine \u2013 Stade de France |\n| Owner | Consortium Stade de France |\n| Operator | Consortium Stade de France |\n| Type |  Football Stadium |\n| Executive suites | 172 |\n| Capacity | 81,338 (football, rugby); 75,000 (athletics)[2] |\n| Field size | 119\u00a0m \u00d7\u00a075\u00a0m (130\u00a0yd \u00d7\u00a082\u00a0yd) |\n| Surface | GrassMaster by Tarkett Sports |\n| Construction |\n| Built | 2\u00a0May 1995; 29 years ago\u00a0(1995-05-02) |\n| Opened | 28\u00a0January 1998; 26 years ago\u00a0(1998-01-28) |\n| Construction cost | \u20ac364 million |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Stade de France has as a regular tenant only the national football and national rugby teams. Repeated attempts to persuade a professional football or rugby team to move there have failed so far. Upon the construction of the stadium, Paris Saint-Germain declined to move there, choosing to remain at the Parc des Princes under pressure from its then-owner (pay-TV network Canal Plus) and the Paris city government.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe discussion of a national stadium in France came about as a result of the country's selection to host the 1998 FIFA World Cup on 2 July 1992.[*citation needed*] As a result of the selection, the country and the French Football Federation made a commitment to construct an 80,000+ capacity all-seater stadium with every seat in the facility being covered. It was the first time in over 70 years since the construction of the Stade Olympique Yves-du-Manoir that a stadium in France was being constructed for a specific event. Due to the magnitude and importance of the facility, the Council of State was allowed first hand approach to how the stadium would be constructed and paid for. The Council sought for the stadium to be built as close as possible to the capital of France, Paris, and that the constructor and operator of the facility would receive significant financial contribution for a period of 30 months following the completion of the stadium. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Lille OSC football team played all its \"home\" games in European competition during the 2005\u201306 season, both in the UEFA Champions League and the UEFA Cup, at the Stade de France because its own stadium was then under renovation, and the only nearer alternative on French soil, Stade F\u00e9lix-Bollaert, was not available as that ground's occupant, Lille's local rival Lens, was also participating in the UEFA Cup. The Stade de France has hosted the Champions League final on three occasions: 2000 (Real Madrid 3 Valencia 0), 2006 (Barcelona 2 Arsenal 1), and 2022 (Real Madrid 1 Liverpool 0),\n\n\n\n### Future developments[edit]\n\n\nFrance's governing body for rugby union, the French Rugby Federation (FFR), announced in November 2010 that it would not renew its deal to use Stade de France for international rugby matches when it expires in 2013. FFR also stated that it planned to build a new stadium of its own in the Paris region.[43]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDomestically, the Stade de France serves as a secondary home facility of Parisian rugby clubs Stade Fran\u00e7ais and Racing 92, hosting a few of their regular-season fixtures. The stadium also hosts the main French domestic cup finals, which include the Coupe de France (both football and rugby), Coupe de la Ligue, Challenge de France, and the Coupe Gambardella, as well as the Top 14 rugby union championship match.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nStadium in Saint-Denis, in the north of Paris, France\n\nNot to be confused with Stade Fran\u00e7ais. For other uses, see Stade de France (disambiguation).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Stade de France, listed as a Category 4 stadium by UEFA, hosted matches at the 1998 FIFA World Cup, the UEFA Champions League finals in 2000, 2006 and 2022. As well as the 1999 and 2007 Rugby World Cup, making it one of only two stadia in the world to have hosted both a Football World Cup final and a rugby union World Cup final (along with Nissan Stadium in Yokohama). It also hosted seven matches at UEFA Euro 2016, including the final, where France lost to Portugal 1\u20130 after extra-time. The facility also hosted the Race of Champions auto race in 2004, 2005, and 2006. The stadium hosted the 2003 World Championships in Athletics and from 1999 to 2016 it hosted the annual Meeting Areva athletics meet.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring the developmental phase, the stadium was referred to in French as the *Grand Stade* (\"large stadium\" or \"great stadium\"). On 4 December 1995, the Ministry of Sport launched a design competition to decide on a name for the stadium. The stadium was officially named the Stade de France after the Ministry heard a proposal from French football legend Michel Platini, who recommended the name. The total cost of the stadium was \u20ac364 million.[5][6]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 24 May 2000, the Stade de France hosted the 2000 UEFA Champions League Final. In the match, which saw 78,759 spectators attend, Spanish club Real Madrid defeated fellow Spanish club Valencia 3\u20130. In 2003, the Stade de France was the primary site of the 2003 World Championships in Athletics. Three years later, the facility hosted another UEFA Champions League final with another Spanish club Barcelona defeating England's Arsenal 2\u20131. On 9 May 2009, the Stade de France set the national attendance record for a sporting match played in France with 80,832 showing up to watch Guingamp upset Brittany rivals Rennes 2\u20131 in the 2009 Coupe de France Final. On 22 May 2010, the Stade de France hosted the 2010 Heineken Cup Final.[11] On 11 February 2012, a Six Nations international rugby game between France and Ireland had to be cancelled just before kick-off due to the pitch freezing as the stadium lacks under-soil heating.[12]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Stade de France with uncovered athletics track during the 2003 World Championships\nThe Stade de France has a movable stand which can be retracted to uncover part of the athletics track.[24] The stadium was notably designed with the assistance of a software simulation of crowd in order to get an accurate observation of how it would look fully developed. The facility was also intended to draw interest in and develop the area of the Plaine Saint-Denis, which straddle the communes of Saint-Denis, Aubervilliers, and Saint-Ouen. The primary goal was to renovate the area by building new residential and tertiary sites.\n\n\nThe stadium was built without any undersoil heating as noted when Ireland were due to play France in the Six Nations Tournament rugby union match of 2012, in which the game had to be canceled.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Stade Geoffroy-Guichard\n* Allianz Riviera\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLocated at 11 meters below the court, the playing area measures 9,000 square meters (120 meters long and 75 meters wide) to a grassed area of 11,000 square meters. Nearly one billion seeds were sown to produce the first pitch in 1997. Today, the grass comes in rolls of 1.20 m x 8 m. Changing the pitch calls for three days of preparation and five days of installation. The change takes place several times a year, depending on the programming stage.\nUnlike many other stadiums, the Stade de France was built without under pitch heating, as the stadium was constructed on the site of an old gasworks,[25] and there were concerns[*by whom?*] it could cause an explosion.\n\n\n\n### Giant screens[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOriginally built for the 1998 FIFA World Cup, the stadium's name was recommended by Michel Platini, head of the organising committee. On 12 July 1998, France beat Brazil 3\u20130 in the 1998 FIFA World Cup Final contested at the stadium. It will host the athletics events at the 2024 Summer Olympics. It will also host matches for the 2023 Rugby World Cup. After the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the 2022 UEFA Champions League Final was moved from the Gazprom Arena to the Stade de France. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nUEFA Euro 2016 stadiums\n |\n| --- |\n| * Parc des Princes (Paris)\n* Nouveau Stade de Bordeaux (Bordeaux)\n* Stade de France (Saint-Denis)\n* Stade de Nice (Nice)\n* Parc Olympique Lyonnais (Lyon)\n* Stade Bollaert-Delelis (Lens)\n* Stade Geoffroy-Guichard (Saint-\u00c9tienne)\n* Stade Pierre-Mauroy (Lille)\n* Stade V\u00e9lodrome (Marseille)\n* Stadium Municipal (Toulouse)\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n46. **^** \"Projet Stade\" (in French).

The new displays have a surface 58% greater than the previous screens installed in 1998. The newer giant screens are each composed of 4,423,680 light emitting diodes. They have faster response time and are brighter than the previous screens.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Major sports matches[edit]\n\n\nSporting events held at the Stade de France include matches (preliminary contests as well as finals) of the 1998 FIFA World Cup, 2003 FIFA Confederations Cup, 2007 Rugby World Cup and UEFA Euro 2016. The 2023 Rugby World Cup, including the final, and the MLB World Tour in 2025 is also planned for the venue.

Its elliptical shape symbolizes the universality of sport in France. Its area of six hectares and weight, 13,000 tons, is considered a technical marvel by many. It was designed to easily protect the 80,000 spectators without covering the playing field.

The tinted glass in the center reduces the contrast and distributes natural light. It filters out red and infrared radiation, however, it allows blue and green lights, due to their necessity involving the health of the turf.\n\n\n\n## Interior[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Visitors' changing room\n### Stands[edit]\n\n\nThe Stade de France is the biggest modular stadium in the world with three galleries.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** \"Zublena Macary Architects\". *e-Architect*. 3 March 2010.

The latter two were absorbed along with their records;[13][14] the present team represents the reunified Federal Republic. The official name and code \"Germany FR (FRG)\" was shortened to \"Germany (GER)\" following reunification in 1990.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe national team's home kit has been traditionally a white shirt, black shorts, and white socks. The colours are derived from the 19th-century flag of the North German State of Prussia.[146] Since 1988, many of the home kit's designs incorporate details patterned after the modern German flag. For the 2014 World Cup, Germany's kit was white shorts rather than the traditional black due to FIFA's kit clashing rule for the tournament.[147] The away shirt colour has changed several times. Historically, a green shirt with white shorts is the most often used alternative colour combination, derived from the DFB colours\u00a0\u2013 though it is often erroneously reported that the choice is in recognition of the fact that Ireland, whose home shirts are green, were the first nation to play Germany in a friendly game after World War II. However, the first team to play Germany after WWII, as stated above, was actually Switzerland.[148] Other colours such as red, grey and black have also been used.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Germany men's national association football team.\n\n* Official website ![Edit this at Wikidata](image) (in German)\n* Germany at UEFA\n* Germany at FIFA\n* Matches results by RSSSF\n* Most capped players by RSSSF\n* Reports for all official matches by eu-football\n\n\n\n\n| Awards and achievements\n |\n| --- |\n| Preceded\u00a0by*Award established*\n |  **FIFA Team of the Year** 1993\n | Succeeded\u00a0by![](image)\u00a0Brazil\n |\n| Preceded\u00a0by![](image)\u00a0Spain\n |  **FIFA Team of the Year** 2014\n | Succeeded\u00a0by![](image)\u00a0Belgium\n |\n| Preceded\u00a0by![](image)\u00a0Argentina\n |  **FIFA Team of the Year** 2017\n | Succeeded\u00a0by![](image)\u00a0Belgium\n |\n| Preceded\u00a0by![](image) Bayern Munich\n |  **Laureus World Team of the Year** 2015\n | Succeeded\u00a0by![](image)\u00a0New Zealand\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMen's association football team\n\nThis article is about the men's team.

After initial security reservations, the DFB decided to play the match on 15 November.[123] After reports about a concrete threat to the stadium, the match was cancelled 90 minutes before kickoff.[124]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAll five matches ended in large defeats for the Germany teams, including a 12\u20130 loss at White Hart Lane in September 1901.[21] Eight years after the establishment of the German Football Association (DFB) in 1900, the first official match of the Germany national football team[d] was played on 5 April 1908, against Switzerland in Basel, with the Swiss winning 5\u20133.[7] A follow-up to the earlier series between England Amateurs and Germany occurred in March 1909 at Oxford's White House Ground[22] and resulted in Germany's largest official defeat to date: 9\u20130 (this time, the match was recognised and recorded as official by the DFB but not by the FA, again due to the amateur side being fielded).[21] These early confrontations formed the beginning of the rich rivalry between the two teams: one of the longest and most enduring international rivalries in football.[23]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the 2022 World Cup, Germany were drawn into Group E with Spain, Japan and Costa Rica. The campaign started with a shock 2\u20131 defeat to Japan.[141] Germany drew 1\u20131 with Spain,[142] and then were knocked out of the World Cup in the group stage for the second consecutive tournament, despite a 4\u20132 win over Costa Rica, missing out on a place in the knockout stages on goal difference.[143]\n\n\nAfter several poor performances following Germany's World Cup exit \u2013 including a 1\u20134 home loss to Japan \u2013 Flick was dismissed on 10 September 2023, while Rudi V\u00f6ller took interim charge of the team, leading the team to a 2\u20131 victory over France.[144]\n\n\nOn 22 September 2023, Julian Nagelsmann was named the new head coach.[145]\n\n\n\n## Team image[edit]\n\n\n### Kits and crest[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\nWikimedia Commons has media

In 2010, the away colours then changed back to a black shirt and white shorts, but at the World Cup, the team dressed up in the black shorts from the home kit. The kit used by Germany returned to a green shirt on its away kit, but then changed again to red-and-black striped shirts with white stripes and letters and black shorts.\n\n\nAdidas AG is the longstanding kit provider to the national team, a sponsorship that began in 1954 and is contracted to continue until at least 2022.[150] In the 70s, Germany wore Erima kits (a German brand, formerly a subsidiary of Adidas).[151][26]\n\n\nAs a common practice, three stars were added above the crest in 1996, symbolising Germany's World Cup titles in 1954, 1974 and 1990. In 2014, a fourth star was added after Germany were crowned world champions for the fourth time.\n\n\n\n#### Kit suppliers[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nGermany squad \u2013 1998 FIFA World Cup\n |\n| --- |\n| * 1\u00a0K\u00f6pke\n* 2\u00a0W\u00f6rns\n* 3\u00a0Heinrich\n* 4\u00a0Kohler\n* 5\u00a0Helmer\n* 6\u00a0Thon\n* 7\u00a0M\u00f6ller\n* 8\u00a0Matth\u00e4us\n* 9\u00a0Kirsten\n* 10\u00a0H\u00e4\u00dfler\n* 11\u00a0Marschall\n* 12\u00a0Kahn\n* 13\u00a0Jeremies\n* 14\u00a0Babbel\n* 15\u00a0Freund\n* 16\u00a0Hamann\n* 17\u00a0Ziege\n* 18\u00a0Klinsmann\u00a0(c)\n* 19\u00a0Reuter\n* 20\u00a0Bierhoff\n* 21\u00a0Tarnat\n* 22\u00a0Lehmann\n* Coach:\u00a0Vogts\n | ![Germany](image)\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nGermany squad \u2013 2002 FIFA World Cup runners-up\n |\n| --- |\n| * 1\u00a0Kahn\u00a0(c)\n* 2\u00a0Linke\n* 3\u00a0Rehmer\n* 4\u00a0Baumann\n* 5\u00a0Ramelow\n* 6\u00a0Ziege\n* 7\u00a0Neuville\n* 8\u00a0Hamann\n* 9\u00a0Jancker\n* 10\u00a0Ricken\n* 11\u00a0Klose\n* 12\u00a0Lehmann\n* 13\u00a0Ballack\n* 14\u00a0Asamoah\n* 15\u00a0Kehl\n* 16\u00a0Jeremies\n* 17\u00a0Bode\n* 18\u00a0B\u00f6hme\n* 19\u00a0Schneider\n* 20\u00a0Bierhoff\n* 21\u00a0Metzelder\n* 22\u00a0Frings\n* 23\u00a0Butt\n* Coach:\u00a0V\u00f6ller\n | ![Germany](image)\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 13 June 2012\n | ![](image)\u00a0Netherlands | Kharkiv, UKR\n | \\*\n | 2\u20131\n | EC 2012 Group | G\u00f3mez ![](image) 24', 38' |\n| 17 June 2012\n | ![](image)\u00a0Denmark | Lviv, UKR\n | \\*\n | 2\u20131\n | EC 2012 Group | Podolski ![](image) 19', Bender ![](image) 80' |\n| 22 June 2012\n | ![](image)\u00a0Greece | Gda\u0144sk, POL\n | \\*\n | 4\u20132\n | EC 2012 Quarter final | Lahm ![](image) 39', Khedira ![](image) 61', Klose ![](image) 68', Reus ![](image) 74' |\n\n\n## Competitive record[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Germany national football team records and statistics\n\n* 1930\u20131938 as ![](image) \u2192 ![](image) \u2192 ![](image)\u00a0Germany\n* 1950\u20131990 as ![](image)\u00a0West Germany\n* 1994\u2013present as ![](image)\u00a0Germany\n\n\n\u00a0 **Champions**\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 **Runners-up**\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Third place\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tournament played fully or partially on home soil\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

The last national team match in Idr\u00e6tsparken was a 0\u20132 Euro 1992 qualification loss to Yugoslavia on 14 November 1990, and on 9 September 1992, Parken was opened with a 1\u20132 defeat in a friendly game against Germany.\n\n\nThe stadium was rebuilt by investors Baltica Finans A/S in turn of the guarantee from the Danish Football Association, that all national matches would be played at Parken for 15 years. The re-construction, tore down and re-built three of the original four stands, cost 640 million Danish kroner.\n\n\nIn 1998, Baltica Finans sold the stadium to F.C. Copenhagen for 138 million DKK, and the club now owns both the stadium and the adjacent office buildings in the company of Parken Sport & Entertainment.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 1980s | * ![Belgium](image) Heysel Stadium (1980)\n* ![West Germany](image) Rheinstadion (1981)\n* ![Spain](image) Camp Nou (1982)\n* ![Sweden](image) Ullevi (1983)\n* ![Switzerland](image) St. Jakob Stadium (1984)\n* ![Netherlands](image) De Kuip (1985)\n* ![France](image) Stade de Gerland (1986)\n* ![Greece](image) Olympic Stadium (1987)\n* ![France](image) Stade de la Meinau (1988)\n* ![Switzerland](image) Wankdorf Stadium (1989)\n |\n| 1990s | * ![Sweden](image) Ullevi (1990)\n* ![Netherlands](image) De Kuip (1991)\n* ![Portugal](image) Est\u00e1dio da Luz (1992)\n* ![England](image) Wembley Stadium (1993)\n* ![Denmark](image) Parken Stadium (1994)\n* ![France](image) Parc des Princes (1995)\n* ![Belgium](image) Heysel Stadium (1996)\n* ![Netherlands](image) De Kuip (1997)\n* ![Sweden](image) R\u00e5sunda Stadium (1998)\n* ![England](image) Villa Park (1999)\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nUEFA Cup and UEFA Europa League final venues\n |\n| --- |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Date | Team #1 | Result | Team #2 | Round | Attendance\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 12 June 2021 | ![](image)\u00a0Denmark | 0\u20131 | ![](image)\u00a0Finland | Group B | 15,200[9] |\n| 17 June 2021 | ![](image)\u00a0Denmark | 1\u20132 | ![](image)\u00a0Belgium | 23,395[10] |\n| 21 June 2021 | ![](image)\u00a0Russia | 1\u20134 | ![](image)\u00a0Denmark | 23,644[11] |\n| 28 June 2021 | ![](image)\u00a0Croatia | 3\u20135 (a.e.t.) | ![](image)\u00a0Spain | Round of 16 | 22,771[12] |\n\n\n## Concert venue[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of concerts at Parken Stadium\n\nAlso used as a concert venue, Parken hosted the Eurovision Song Contest 2001.

Being a 4-star stadium, Parken can not apply for the biggest European club game, the UEFA Champions League final, as that demands 50,000 seats.\n\n\nOn 2 June 2007, Parken was the venue for the UEFA Euro 2008 qualifier fan attack.\n\n\nOn 1 May 2014 a new stadium covering Wi-Fi solution, powered by Telia was published. The deal provides free high speed Wi-Fi for all spectators at any event at the stadium.[6] The agreement includes a 7 year long naming sponsorship, and on 17 July 2014, the stadium name was changed to Telia Parken.[7]\n\n\nOn 26 August 2020, it was announced that the stadiums name would be reverted to the original name, Parken, five days later on 31 August.\n\n\n\n## Notable matches[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** https://www.uefa.com/MultimediaFiles/Download/FirstDiv/uefaorg/Publications/01/67/03/93/1670393\\_DOWNLOAD.pdf [*bare URL PDF*]\n2. **^** [1], fck.dk\n3. **^** Wembley to stage UEFA EURO 2020 final, UEFA.com\n4. **^** Geranium (The World's 50 Best Restaurants)\n5. **^** \"PARKEN AND 3 ENTER INTO STADIUM SPONSORSHIP AGREEMENT\".

In 1986, a new Olympic stadium was designed, with a football field and an athletics track. It was to be built in the area of Strandvliet in Amsterdam Zuidoost. After Amsterdam lost the bid to Barcelona in October 1986, the plans for the new stadium were abandoned. In 1987, the Stichting Amsterdam Sportstad (English: \"Amsterdam Sports City Foundation\") was established, which made new plans for a sports stadium with an all-seated capacity of 55,000. In 1990, a new design was made based on both previous designs, with a football field, an athletics track, and completely covered by a roof. By this time, AFC Ajax needed a new stadium, as their previous home ground, De Meer, was far too small for most of Ajax's games. Since the late 1960s, Ajax had moved its most important games to Olympisch Stadion.[7] Indeed, from the 1920s onward, Ajax had played all of their European fixtures and midweek night games at Olympisch Stadion.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSports venue in Amsterdam, Netherlands\n\nThis article is about the stadium of AFC Ajax.
