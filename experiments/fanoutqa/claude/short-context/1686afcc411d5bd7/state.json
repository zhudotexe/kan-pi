The headquarters has since experienced multiple expansions since its establishment. It is estimated to encompass over 8\u00a0million ft2 (750,000\u00a0m2) of office space and 30,000\u201340,000 employees.[244] Additional offices are located in Bellevue and Issaquah, Washington (90,000 employees worldwide). The company is planning to upgrade its Mountain View, California, campus on a grand scale. The company has occupied this campus since 1981. In 2016, the company bought the 32-acre (13\u00a0ha) campus, with plans to renovate and expand it by 25%.[245] Microsoft operates an East Coast headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina,[246] where the construction of a data center led to the destruction of a historic black cemetery.[247]\n\n\n\n### Flagship stores[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Palo Alto Networks\n* Paychex\n* PayPal\n* PDD Holdings\n* PepsiCo\n* Qualcomm\n* Regeneron\n* Roper Technologies\n* Ross Stores\n* Sirius XM\n* Starbucks\n* Synopsys\n* Take-Two Interactive\n* T-Mobile US\n* Tesla\n* Texas Instruments\n* Trade Desk\n* Verisk\n* Vertex\n* Walgreens Boots Alliance\n* Warner Bros.

Microsoft also has additional offices in nearby Bellevue and Issaquah, Washington.\n\nThe company also maintains other significant locations, including:\n- An East Coast headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina\n- A campus in Mountain View, California (which they've occupied since 1981 and plan to renovate and expand)\n- Various international offices\n\nBut the main global headquarters remains at the Redmond campus in Washington state.",

The visitor's center includes a brick-and-mortar Google Store, a public plaza, a caf\u00e9, and public art, and opened on October 12, 2023.[20]\n\n\n\n## Location[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Google buildings are near Shoreline Park.\n![](image)Googleplex courtyard\nIn 2013, construction began on a new 1.1-million-square-foot (100,000-square-meter) campus dubbed \"Bay View\", adjoining the original campus on 42 acres (17\u00a0ha) leased from the NASA Ames Research Center and overlooking San Francisco Bay at Moffett Federal Airfield. The estimated cost of the project was $120 million with a target opening date of 2015.[12][13][14]\n\n\nNBBJ was the architect and this was the first time Google has designed its own buildings.[15]\n\n\nThe addition is off the northeast corner of the complex, by the Stevens Creek Nature Study Area and Shoreline Park. Before announcing the construction, Google, through its internal real estate firm, Planetary Ventures, sought permission from the City of Mountain View to build bridges over the adjacent Stevens Creek.[16] Google's 2012 year-end annual report noted it can develop only 7 acres (2.8\u00a0ha) of the 42-acre (17-hectare) site.[17]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n6. **^** Conrad, Katherine (June 14, 2006). \"Google to purchase Mountain View buildings\". *San Jose Mercury News*.

The lawsuit, which was filed in 2019, alleged that the company enabled housing discrimination through targeted advertising, as it allowed home owners and landlords to run housing ads excluding people based on sex, race, religion, and other characteristics. The US Department of Justice stated that this was in violation of the Fair Housing Act.

Meta Platforms Ireland is subject to the US GILTI tax of 10.5% on global intangible profits (i.e. Irish profits). On the basis that Meta Platforms Ireland Limited is paying some tax, the effective minimum US tax for Facebook Ireland will be circa 11%. In contrast, Meta Platforms Inc. would incur a special IP tax rate of 13.125% (the FDII rate) if its Irish business relocated to the US. Tax relief in the US (21% vs. Irish at the GILTI rate) and accelerated capital expensing, would make this effective US rate around 12%.[159][160][161]\n\n\nThe insignificance of the US/Irish tax difference was demonstrated when Facebook moved 1.5bn non-EU accounts to the US to limit exposure to GDPR.[162][163]\n\n\n\n## Facilities[edit]\n\n\n### Offices[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n\"Meta\" had been registered as a trademark in the United States in 2018 (after an initial filing in 2015) for marketing, advertising, and computer services, by a Canadian company that provided big data analysis of scientific literature.[64] This company was acquired in 2017 by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI), a foundation established by Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan, and became one of their projects.[65] Following the rebranding announcement, CZI announced that it had already decided to deprioritize the earlier Meta project, that it would be transferring its rights to the name to Meta Platforms, and that the project would end in 2022.[66]\n\n\n\n### 2022\u2013present: Declining profits and mass layoffs[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAccording to published reports by Bloomberg on March 30, 2022, Meta turned over data such as phone numbers, physical addresses, and IP addresses to hackers posing as law enforcement officials using forged documents. The law enforcement requests sometimes included forged signatures of real or fictional officials. When asked about the allegations, a Meta representative said, \"We review every data request for legal sufficiency and use advanced systems and processes to validate law enforcement requests and detect abuse.\"[75] In June 2022, Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer of 14 years, announced she would step down that year. Zuckerberg said that Javier Olivan would replace Sandberg, though in a \"more traditional\" role.[76]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n13. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Meta Platforms, Inc. 2022 Annual Report (Form 10-K)\".

In late November 2019, Facebook, Inc. announced the acquisition of the game developer Beat Games, responsible for developing one of that year's most popular VR games, *Beat Saber*.[101] In Late 2022 after Facebook Inc rebranded to Meta Platforms Inc, Oculus was rebranded to Meta Quest.\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
