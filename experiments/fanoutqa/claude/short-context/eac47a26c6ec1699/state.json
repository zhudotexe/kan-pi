Assuming office in 2023, she became the university's first black president 368 years after its founding.[2]\n\n\nPrior to becoming the university's president, she served as the Edgerley Family Dean of Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences and the Wilbur A. Cowett Professor of Government and of African and African-American Studies.[3] Gay's research addresses American political behavior, including voter turnout and politics of race and identity.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education\n\n[edit]\n\nGay grew up the child of Haitian immigrants, who came to the United States over fifty years ago and met in New York City as students. Her mother studied nursing and her father studied engineering.[4] Gay spent much of her childhood first in New York City, and then in Saudi Arabia, where her father worked for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,[5] while her mother was a registered nurse.[5] Gay is a cousin of writer Roxane Gay.[4]\n\n\nGay attended Phillips Exeter Academy, a private boarding school in Exeter, New Hampshire,[6] and then attended Stanford University, where she studied economics. She received the Anna Laura Myers Prize for best undergraduate thesis in economics and graduated in 1992.[5] Gay then earned her Ph.D. in 1998 from Harvard University, where she won the university's Toppan Prize for the best dissertation in political science.[7]\n\n\n\n## Career\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter graduating, Gay served as assistant professor, then tenured associate professor in Stanford University's Department of Political Science from 2000 to 2006. In the 2003-2004 academic year, Gay was a fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences.[5]\n\n\nSubsequently, Gay was recruited to Harvard to be a professor of government in 2006 and additionally appointed professor of African American studies in 2007.[3] In 2015, she was simultaneously named the Wilbur A. Cowett Professor of Government and of African and African-American Studies and Dean of Social Studies at the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. Three years later, in 2018, she was appointed to become the Edgerley Family Dean of the Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences.\n\n\nAs Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS), which is responsible for both graduate and undergraduate studies, Gay outlined four priorities: increasing diversity among faculty, increasing interdisciplinary studies among students, encouraging collaboration among professors, and fostering faculty involvement in the university's community.[8] During this time, the university had to deal with educational and financial disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic. For fiscal year 2020, the FAS reported losses of $15.8 million.[9] In 2021, Gay announced that the cost of the FAS's core academic commitments were greater than its revenues and began processes to reduce expenses including a freeze on faculty bonuses and salary increases and a freeze on faculty searches.[8] In 2021, FAS reported a surplus of $51 million, a dramatic increase from the projected deficit of $112 million.[10] The surplus was part of a larger $238 million university wide surplus for fiscal year 2021.[11]\n\n\nIn 2019, Harvard Law Professor and Faculty Dean of Winthrop House, Ronald Sullivan, faced scrutiny by students and school administrators, including Gay, for joining the legal defense team for Harvey Weinstein, who at the time was on trial for rape, while serving as dean.[12] Gay believed that the role of a residential dean came with \"an expectation of a special responsibility to the well-being of the students\" and found Sullivan's justification for defending a unpopular defendant \"insufficient.\"[13] In May 2019, the college announced that Sullivan and his wife, who were the university's first black faculty deans, would not have their faculty dean contracts renewed. The decision was controversial and was denounced by the American Civil Liberties Union, saying the university \"could have used the incident as a teachable moment about the importance of criminal defense in our society as well as about the importance of tolerance on a campus of higher learning.\"[14] The university controversially announced that the decision to not renew Sullivan's contract was due to performance and morale conditions in Winthrop House.[15] However, the ACLU concluded that \"from all appearances, it was Sullivan\u2019s representation of Weinstein, not his performance as dean, that prompted his dismissal.\"[14] Sullivan publicly accused Gay and Dean Rakesh Khurana of misleading the university and the public as to their reasonings for his dismissal.[16]\n\n\nIn June 2022, Harvard President Larry Bacow announced he would be resigning from the post in one year. A search committee, led by Penny Pritzker, Senior Fellow at the Harvard Corporation, considered 600 nominees and selected Gay to succeed Bacow in one of the shortest presidential search committees in the university's history. On December 15, 2022, Harvard University announced that Gay had been selected as the 30th president of Harvard University where she would serve as the university's first black president.[17][18] She officially took over the role on July 1, 2023.[19]\n\n\nIn addition to her time at Harvard and Stanford, Gay served as a vice president of the Midwest Political Science Association from 2014 to 2017[20] and as a trustee of Phillips Exeter Academy since 2017.[6]\n\n\nFollowing Hamas's terrorist attack on Israel, Gay was criticized by many individuals, including former Harvard President Larry Summers,[21][22] for failing to condemn the attacks.\n\n\n\n## Publications\n\n[edit]\n\n* 1998: \"Doubly Bound: The Impact of Gender and Race on the Politics of Black Women\", *Political Psychology*, co-authored with Katherine Tate\n* 2001: \"The Effect of Black Congressional Representation on Political Participation\", *American Political Science Review*\n* 2001: *The Effect of Minority Districts and Minority Representation on Political Participation in California*, Public Policy Institute of California\n* 2002: \"Spirals of Trust?

The band has a rotating membership of Yale faculty, students, and residents of New Haven and released its first album, \"Pick or Perish\", in June 2013.[29][30] He served as a trustee of the International Bluegrass Music Museum and on the advisory board of the Connecticut Folk Festival.[8] He now is a trustee of the IBMA Foundation for bluegrass music.\n\n\nSalovey is married to Marta Elisa Moret, a 1984 graduate of the Yale School of Public Health, former Deputy Commissioner for the Connecticut Department of Social Services, and the president of Urban Policy Strategies, LLC. She is an adjunct faculty member in the Department of Public Health at Southern Connecticut State University.[31] They met as students at Yale and married in 1986 in Orange, Connecticut.[1][32]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn recognition of his research contributions, Salovey has received the National Science Foundation Presidential Young Investigator Award, the National Cancer Institute CIS Partner in Research Award, and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration Excellence Award. The Division of Health Psychology (Division 38) of the American Psychological Association recognized him with its Outstanding Contributions to Health Psychology by a Senior Professional Award. He has received two awards for excellence in teaching at Yale, the William Clyde DeVane Medal and the Lex Hixon '63 Prize for Teaching Excellence in the Social Sciences. Other honors include honorary degrees from the University of Pretoria, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Harvard University, McGill University, National Tsing Hua University, University of Haifa, and Vytautas Magnus University, as well as membership in the National Academy of Medicine and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.[5][8][26]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn all, Salovey has authored or edited thirteen books translated into eleven languages and published more than 350 journal articles and essays.\n\n\nOutside Yale, Salovey has served on the National Science Foundation's Social Psychology Advisory Panel, the National Institute of Mental Health Behavioral Science Working Group, and the NIMH National Advisory Mental Health Council. Salovey served as President of the Society for General Psychology and Treasurer of the International Society for Research on Emotion.

It is one of nine colonial colleges and was chartered prior to the U.S. Declaration of Independence when Benjamin Franklin, the university's founder and first president, advocated for an educational institution that trained leaders in academia, commerce, and public service. Penn identifies as the fourth oldest institution of higher education in the United States, though this representation is challenged by other universities, as Franklin first convened the Board of Trustees in 1749, arguably making it the fifth oldest institution of higher education in the U.S.[note 2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n31. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Montgomery, Thomas Harrison (1900). *A History of the University of Pennsylvania from Its Foundation to A.

Rockefeller Professor of Public Affairs in the Princeton School of Public and International Affairs and the University Center for Human Values.[3][4][5] He is also an expert on constitutional law, with an emphasis on law & religion and federal judicial appointments.\n\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\nEisgruber graduated *magna cum laude* from Princeton University in 1983, receiving an AB in physics and was inducted into Phi Beta Kappa.[5][6][7] He completed his senior thesis, titled \"The global implications of local violations of the energy conditions\", under the supervision of Malcolm Perry; his thesis addressed topics in the theory of general relativity.[8][7] He also studied political theory with Jeffrey K. Tulis and constitutional interpretation with Walter F. Murphy, (the latter would inspire Eisgruber to pursue a career in constitutional law). During his junior year at Princeton, he was a member of the Elm Club.[9] After graduating from Princeton, Eisgruber won a Rhodes Scholarship to attend University College, Oxford, where he earned an MLitt in politics in 1987. Upon his return from Oxford, Eisgruber attended the University of Chicago Law School where he graduated *cum laude* with a JD in 1988.[5][6] While in law school, he served as editor-in-chief of the *University of Chicago Law Review*.[10]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nFollowing his graduation from law school, Eisgruber served as law clerk to Judge Patrick Higginbotham of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit and then Justice John Paul Stevens of the Supreme Court of the United States.[5]\n\n\nAfter clerking, Eisgruber taught at New York University Law School for eleven years, from 1990 to 2001, before coming to Princeton.[5] From 2001 to 2004, Eisgruber was the director of Princeton's Program in Law and Public Affairs.[6] He served as the provost of Princeton from 2004 to 2013.[6]\n\n\n\n![](image)Eisgruber (third from left) signing an agreement to bring Navy ROTC back to Princeton.\nEisgruber was elected as Princeton's 20th president on April 21, 2013, and assumed the office on July 1, 2013.[11] A formal installation ceremony was held on September 22, 2013.[12]\n\n\nEisgruber has served on several boards, including the academic advisory board of Coursera, a provider of massive open online courses; the Board of Trustees of the Educational Testing Service; the Board of Trustees of Princeton University Press;[13] the Board of Trustees of ITHAKA and Artstor; and the Board of Directors of Liulishuo. He is also a steering committee member of the American Talent Initiative and a member of the Global University Leaders Forum of the World Economic Forum.[14]\n\n\nEisgruber was elected as a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2014.[15]\n\n\n\n## Presidency[edit]\n\n\nEisgruber was formally installed as Princeton's 20th president on September 22, 2013.[16] Eisgruber is the first Princeton president who received his undergraduate degree from the university since Robert Goheen, who served from 1957 to 1972.[17] He is also the first president since Francis Landey Patton (president from 1888 to 1902) who does not hold a PhD.[18]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nEisgruber is a native of Lafayette, Indiana.[2] Both his parents were German immigrants who met as graduate students at Purdue University.[19] Eisgruber moved to Oregon with his family in 1973.[20] His father was the dean of the School of Agricultural Sciences at Oregon State University.[19]\n\n\nEisgruber captained the 1979 U.S. National High School Chess Champion team in his senior year at Corvallis High School[21]\n\n\nHis wife, Lori A. Martin, is a partner in the New York office of the law firm WilmerHale,[22] and they have a son, Danny, who is a graduate of the University of Chicago.[13]\n\n\nEisgruber was raised Catholic and married his wife in an Episcopal church. While helping his son, then in the fourth grade, with a school project, he discovered that his Berlin-born mother, who had arrived in New York as an eight-year-old refugee, was Jewish. Today, Eisgruber identifies as a nontheist Jew.[23] His wife is Episcopalian.[24] In 2009, a Holocaust claims tribunal awarded Eisgruber and his three sisters 162,500 Swiss francs, representing the value of the bank account of their maternal great-grandfather, Salomon Kalisch.[2]\n\n\nEisgruber is a lifelong fan of the Chicago Cubs.[25]\n\n\n\n## Publications[edit]\n\n\nBooks\n* *The Next Justice: Repairing the Supreme Court Appointments Process* (2007)\n* *Religious Freedom and the Constitution*, with Lawrence G.

The position was first created in 1754 by the original royal charter for the university, issued by George II, and the power to appoint the president was given to an autonomous board of trustees. The university suspended operations upon the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War, during which no individual served as president. When it was resuscitated by the New York State Legislature, the university was placed directly under the control of the Board of Regents of the University of the State of New York; its chancellor, George Clinton, served as the *de facto* president of Columbia University.[1] Through the efforts of Alexander Hamilton and John Jay, control of the university was returned to a private board of trustees in 1787, which has to this day maintained the right to appoint or remove the president, who also serves on the board *ex officio*.[1] The university's first president was Samuel Johnson, who held the office from 1754 to 1763, and its 20th and current president is Minouche Shafik, whose tenure began on July 1, 2023.\n\n\nUpon the founding of the university, it was stipulated by the vestrymen of Trinity Church, on whose land King's College sat, that every president must be a member of the Church of England; otherwise, the land would revert back to the church.[2] As such, every single president of the university until the appointment of Dwight D. Eisenhower was Anglican, while the first six presidents, with the exception of William Samuel Johnson, were all either Anglican priests or bishops.[3] Michael I. Sovern, appointed in 1980, was the university's first Jewish president.[4] In 2023, Minouche Shafik became the woman to serve as president of the university.[5]\n\n\nFrom 1902 to 1970, every president was involved in foreign relations in some capacity: Nicholas Murray Butler was the president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace from 1925 to 1945, and was awarded a Nobel Peace Prize for his promotion of the Kellogg\u2013Briand Pact; Dwight D. Eisenhower served as Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force during World War II, and after his tenure would serve as President of the United States; and Grayson L. Kirk and Andrew W. Cordier were both instrumental to the formation of the United Nations.\n\n\nAs established by Columbia University's governing statutes, it is the duty of the president to exercise jurisdiction over all affairs of the university; to call special meetings of the University Senate, faculties, and administration; to report to the Trustees of Columbia on the state and needs of the university annually; and to administer discipline. The consent of the president is necessary for any act made by a faculty or administrative board, unless their veto is overridden by two-thirds vote. Additionally, the president is able to grant leaves of absences, give faculty permission to use university laboratories for experiments, and confer academic and honorary degrees on behalf of the board of trustees.[1]\n\n\nThe president is *ex officio* a permanent member of the Pulitzer Prize Board, and has annually presented the awards to its recipients since 1984.[6] In addition, the president is an *ex officio* member of the board of trustees of Barnard College.[7]\n\n\n\n## List of presidents[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| # | Image | President | Birth year\u2013Death year | Years as president | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | ![](image) | Samuel Johnson[8] | 1696\u20131772 | 1754\u20131763 |  |\n| 2 | ![](image) | Myles Cooper[8] | 1735\u20131785 | 1763\u20131775 |  |\n| \u2013 | ![](image) | Benjamin Moore, B.A. 1768[8] | 1748\u20131816 | 1775\u20131776 | acting\n |\n| \u2013 | ![](image) | George Clinton[9] | 1739\u20131812 | 1784\u20131787 | as chancellor of the University of the State of New York; 1st governor of New York and later 4th vice president of the United States |\n| 3 | ![](image) | William Samuel Johnson[8] | 1727\u20131819 | 1787\u20131800 | signed the Constitution of the United States; served as United States Senator from Connecticut |\n| 4 | ![](image) | Charles Henry Wharton[8] | 1748\u20131833 | 1801\u20131801 |  |\n| 5 | ![](image) | Benjamin Moore, B.A. 1768[8] | 1748\u20131816 | 1801\u20131810 |  |\n| 6 | ![](image) | William Harris[8] | 1765\u20131829 | 1811\u20131829 | shared authority with Provost John Mitchell Mason until 1816\n |\n| 7 | ![](image) | William Alexander Duer[8] | 1780\u20131858 | 1829\u20131842 |  |\n| 8 | ![](image) | Nathaniel Fish Moore, B.A. 1802[8] | 1782\u20131872 | 1842\u20131849 |  |\n| 9 | ![](image) | Charles King[8] | 1789\u20131867 | 1849\u20131863 | presided over move to Madison Avenue campus\n |\n| 10 | ![](image) | Frederick Augustus Porter Barnard[8] | 1809\u20131889 | 1864\u20131888 |  |\n| \u2013\n | ![](image) | Henry Drisler, B.A. 1839[10] | 1818\u20131897\n | 1867, 1888\u20131889\n | acting\n |\n| 11 | ![](image) | Seth Low, B.A. 1870[8] | 1850\u20131916 | 1890\u20131901 | presided over move to Morningside Heights campus; 23rd mayor of Brooklyn and 92nd mayor of New York City |\n| \u2013\n | ![](image) | John Howard Van Amringe, B.A. 1860, M.A. 1863[11] | 1836\u20131915\n | 1899\n | acting\n |\n| 12 | ![](image) | Nicholas Murray Butler, B.A. 1882, M.A. 1883, Ph.D. 1884[8] | 1862\u20131947 | 1902\u20131945 | Nobel Peace Prize laureate\n |\n| \u2013 | ![](image) | Frank D.

Previously, she was the Hughes Rogers Professor of Economics & Public Affairs at Princeton University as well as the dean of Princeton School of Public and International Affairs.[1][2]\n\n\nIn March 2012, Paxson was selected as the 19th president of Brown University. She officially succeeded Ruth Simmons on July 1, 2012, and was inaugurated on October 27, 2012.[3][4]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter spending her childhood in Forest Hills, a suburb of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Paxson received her B.A. from Swarthmore College in 1982, where she majored in economics and minored in English and philosophy as a member of the Phi Beta Kappa Society.[5][6]\n\n\nOriginally a graduate student at Columbia University's Business School, Paxson transferred to Columbia's Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, receiving her M.A. and Ph.D. in economics, in 1985 and 1987, respectively, with a focus on labor.[1][7] Paxson was advised by Joseph Altonji and her dissertation involved analyzing the effects of consumer interest rates on the consumer credit market.[7] Paxson is married to Ari Gabinet and has two children, Nicholas and Benjamin.[7] Raised a Quaker, she converted to her husband's Jewish faith.[8]\n\n\n\n## Career\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2000, she founded the Center for Health and Wellbeing at Princeton, an interdisciplinary research center based in the Woodrow Wilson School. She served as the chair of Princeton's Economics Department in academic year 2008\u201309. She was also the founding director of an NIA Center for the Economics and Demography of Aging at Princeton.[1] During her time at Princeton, Paxson also served as a visiting professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.[9]\n\n\nPaxson's most recent research focuses on the impact of childhood health and circumstances on economic and health outcomes over the lifecourse; the impact of the AIDS crisis on children's health and education in Africa; and the long run consequences of Hurricane Katrina on the mental and physical health of vulnerable populations. Paxson has been a Senior Editor of *The Future of Children*, an interdisciplinary journal that works to build a bridge between cutting edge social science research and the policy community.\n\n\n\n### Brown University\n\n[edit]\n\nChristina Paxson at Brown\n![](image)\nPaxson presided over Brown's 250th anniversary celebration in 2014\n![](image)\nHonoring Richard I. Gouse '68, primary donor of the Richard Gouse Field at Brown Stadium, in 2021\n\nAs President of Brown University, Paxson has focused on a set of strategic goals announced in 2014; among these institutional priorities are data science, the creative arts, and brain science.[10] Under Paxson's leadership, the University has established a School of Public Health as well as numerous centers and institutes including the Brown Arts Institute, the Brown Institute for Translational Science, the Data Science Initiative, and the Nelson Center for Entrepreneurship.\n\n\nFor three consecutive years under her leadership, Brown students and graduates have earned the most Fulbright Scholarships of all U.S. Universities.[11]\n\n\nShe has also sustained undergraduate financial aid as the fastest growing area of Brown's budget by increasing scholarships for low-income families and eliminating loans from University-awarded financial aid packages, as part of The Brown Promise, in addition to Brown's Pathways to Diversity and Inclusion action plan.[11]\n\n\nPaxson has overseen a considerable expansion of Brown's academic, performing arts, and residential facilities. Expansion of Brown's physical footprint under Paxson's leadership has been controversial, at times spurring criticism from community organizations and preservation groups.[12][13][14][15]\n\n\nIn 2019, she told the University that she would not honor a student-sponsored referendum calling for Brown to divest from companies that engage in human rights abuses in Palestine, and said that it would not be possible to make the details of the University's investments available to the public.[16][17] She has been a member of the Kol Emet congregation, a Jewish Reconstructionist synagogue, committed to the growth of a spiritually and intellectually engaging Judaism.[18][19][20]\n\n\nA Fall 2021 poll conducted by *The Brown Daily Herald* found that 47.1% of surveyed students \"strongly\" or \"somewhat\" disapproved of Paxson's leadership while 32.8% \"strongly\" or \"somewhat\" approved.[21] The publication's Fall 2017 poll placed Paxson's approval rating at 61.9%.[22][23]\n\n\n\n### Other Activities\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2013, Paxson wrote a *New Republic* op-ed, arguing for ongoing relevance of the humanities from an economist's perspective.[24]\n\n\nPaxson has also maintained numerous institutional affiliations: in addition to being a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, she was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2017.[25][26] The previous year, she became a member of the board of directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. After serving as its deputy chair, she became the chair of its board of directors in 2021.[27][28][29] In 2018, Paxson received an honorary doctorate from Williams College.[30]\n\n\nIn wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, Paxson penned a *New York Times* op-ed and appeared on CNN, outlining her views on the importance of reopening colleges safely in the fall of 2020.[31][32] On June 4, 2020, Paxson testified before the U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, during a hearing entitled \"COVID-19: Going Back to College Safely.\"[33]\n\n\n\n## Selected publications\n\n[edit]\n\n* \"Stature and Status: Height, Ability, and Labor Market Outcomes\" (with Anne Case), *Journal of Political Economy*, 116(3): 499\u2013532, June 2008.\n* \"Racial Disparities in Childhood Asthma in the US: Evidence from the National Health Interview Survey, 1997\u20132003\" (with Marla McDaniel and Jane Waldfogel), *Pediatrics* 117(5): e868-e877, May 2006.\n* \"Orphans in Africa: Parental Death, Poverty and School Enrollment\" (with Anne Case and Joseph Ableidinger), *Demography* 41(3), pp.\u00a0483\u2013508, August 2004.\n* \"Economic Status and Health in Childhood: The Origins of the Gradient\" (with Anne Case and Darren Lubotsky), *American Economic Review* 92(5), December 2002.\n* \"Economies of Scale, Household Size, and the Demand for Food\" (with Angus Deaton), *Journal of Political Economy* 106(5): 897\u2013930, October 1998.\n* \"Intertemporal Choice and Inequality\" (with Angus Deaton), *Journal of Political Economy* 102(3): 437\u2013467, 1994.\n* \"Consumption and Income Seasonality in Thailand,\" *Journal of Political Economy* 101(1): 39\u201372, February 1993.\n* \"Using Weather Variability to Estimate the Response of Savings to Transitory Income in Thailand,\" *American Economic Review* 82(1), March 1992.\n* \"Causes and Consequences of Early Life Health\" (with Anne Case) *Demography* 47(1): S65-S85, March 2010.\n* \"The Long Reach of Childhood Health and Circumstance: Evidence from the Whitehall II Study\" (with Anne Case), *Economic Journal, Royal Economic Society* 121(554): F183-F204, 2008.\n* \"The Impact of the AIDS Pandemic on Health Services in Africa: Evidence from Demographic and Health Surveys\" (With Anne Case), *Demography* 48(2): 675\u2013697, May 2009.\n* \"Making Sense of the Labor Market Height Premium: Evidence From the British Household Panel Survey\" (With Anne Case and Mahnaz Islam), *Economics Letters* 102(3): 174\u2013176, March 2008.\n* \"The Income Gradient in Children's Health: A Comment on Currie, Shields and Wheatley Price\" (With Anne Case & Diana Lee), *Journal of Health Economics* 27(3), 801\u2013807, October 2007\n* \"Socioeconomic Status and Health in Childhood: A Comment on Chen, Martin and Matthews\" (With Anne Case & Tom Vogl), *Social Science & Medicine, 189-214*\n* \"From Cradle to Grave?

As President of Barnard, she was also an academic dean within Columbia University. Beilock spent 12 years at the University of Chicago, departing Chicago as the Stella M. Rowley Professor of Psychology and Executive Vice Provost.[4] She holds doctorates of philosophy in both kinesiology and psychology from Michigan State University.[5][6]\n\n\n\n\n## Education\n\n[edit]\n\nBeilock graduated from the University of California, San Diego with a B.S. in Cognitive Science and a minor in Psychology. She was awarded a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) from Michigan State University in 2003.\n\n\n\n## Career\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring and subsequent to her PhD research, Beilock explored differences between novice and expert athletic performances. Later in her career, Beilock's research focused on why people perform poorly in stressful academic situations, such as taking a high-stakes mathematics exam. Beilock found that worries during those situations rob individuals of the working memory or cognitive horsepower they would normally have to focus. Because people with more working memory rely on their brainpower more, they can be affected to a greater extent in stressful academic situations. Beilock's work demonstrated that stressful situations during tests might diminish meaningful differences between students that, under less-stressful situations, might exhibit greater differences in performance.[7]\n\n\nFrom 2003 to 2005, Beilock was an assistant professor in the Department of Psychology at Miami University. She was on the faculty at The University of Chicago from 2005 until 2017, where she was the Stella M. Rowley Professor of Psychology and Executive Vice Provost.[5] On July 1, 2017, she became the 8th president of Barnard College.[8][9] On July 21, 2022, it was announced that Beilock will become the first woman ever to lead Dartmouth College in 2023.[10][11] She began as president of Dartmouth on June 12, 2023.[12] Beilock stated her focus is on improving student mental health. She has faced a tumultuous start due to several high profile incidents, including the arrests of two student protestors and free-speech concerns around monitoring of student communications. [13] [14]\n\n\n\n### Cognitive science and education\n\n[edit]\n\nBeilock's research relates to educational practice and policy.[15] Her work demonstrates that students' attitudes and anxieties (as well as those of their teachers) are critical to student success.[16] In her work, she has developed simple psychological interventions to help people perform their best under stress.[17]\n\n\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]\n\n* Wheelock Succession\n\n\n## Books\n\n[edit]\n\n* Beilock, S.

As a result, classes and research were suspended until a tentative agreement was reached on April 15, 2023.[56][57] Five months later, in September, the university's faculty senate voted \"no confidence\" in Holloway; in addition to issues related to the strikes, the motion also cited Halloway's decision to dismiss the chancellor of the university's Newark campus and his proposal to merge the university's two medical schools.[58]\n\n\n\n## Organization and administration[edit]\n\n\n### University president[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Rutgers University presidents\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n64. **^** Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey.

Rutgers invited multiple notable alumni from around the world to the celebration.[51] Steven Van Zandt was the commencement speaker the following year and received an honorary doctorate.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMulti-campus public research university in New Jersey\n\n\"Rutgers\" redirects here. For other uses, see Rutgers (disambiguation).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGovernance at Rutgers University rests with a board of trustees consisting of 41 members, and a board of governors consisting of 15 voting members: 8 appointed by the Governor of New Jersey and 7 chosen by and from among the board of trustees.[68][69][70] The trustees constitute chiefly an advisory body to the board of governors and are the fiduciary overseers of the property and assets of the university that existed before the institution became the State University of New Jersey in 1945. The initial reluctance of the trustees (still acting as a private corporate body) to cede control of certain business affairs to the state government for direction and oversight caused the state to establish the Board of governors in 1956.[71] Today, the board of governors maintains much of the corporate control of the university.[72]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1825, Queen's College was renamed **Rutgers College**[14] in honor of Colonel Henry Rutgers, whose substantial gift to the school had stabilized its finances during a period of uncertainty.[15] For most of its existence, Rutgers was a private liberal arts college but it has evolved into a coeducational public research university after being designated The State University of New Jersey by the New Jersey Legislature via laws enacted in 1945 and 1956.[16]\n\n\nRutgers has four distinct campuses: Rutgers University\u2013New Brunswick, including grounds in adjacent Piscataway; Rutgers University\u2013Newark; Rutgers University\u2013Camden; and Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences. The university has additional facilities throughout the state, including oceanographic research facilities at the Jersey Shore.[17]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRutgers is a land-grant, sea-grant, and space-grant university, as well as the largest university in the state.[18] Instruction is offered by 9,000 faculty members in 175 academic departments to over 45,000 undergraduate students and more than 20,000 graduate and professional students.[6] The university is accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools[19] and is a member of the Association of American Universities[20] and the Universities Research Association.[21]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Rutgers University\n\n### 18th century[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Doctor Honoris Causa Archived September 4, 2015, at the Wayback Machine diploma of Linus Pauling.\n2. **^** \"Official Rutgers University Seal\".

She was named the twenty-eighth president of the College of William & Mary on February 20, 2018. She began her service on July 2, 2018 succeeding W. Taylor Reveley III, who had served as president since 2008.[2] After seven months in office, Rowe was formally inaugurated February 8, 2019 as part of the university's annual Charter Day ceremony.[3]\n\n\n\n## Career\n\n[edit]\n\nRowe, a Shakespearean scholar, is recognized for her work in the digital innovation of the liberal arts. As the guest editor of the *Shakespeare Quarterly*'s special issue on New Media, Rowe led the first open review of a traditional humanities journal on the web. *The New York Times* deemed the special issue \"trailblazing.\"[4] In a 2020 special report, *Diverse: Issues in Higher Education* highlighted Rowe as one of 35 leading women in higher education.[5]\n\n\nRowe served as provost and dean of the faculty of Smith College from 2014 to 2018. While at Smith, she also served as the interim vice president for inclusion, diversity and equity. In this role, Rowe is credited with transforming Smith's liberal arts curriculum and increasing diversity in faculty hiring.[6] During her tenure as provost, Smith College developed \"one of the first statistical and data sciences majors at a liberal arts college\u2026\u201d[7] as well as worked to integrate design thinking methodology across curricula.[8] Rowe also oversaw the creation of Smith College's first MOOC (Massive Open Online Course).[9]\n\n\nPrior to Smith, she served as an English professor at Bryn Mawr College from 1998 to 2014, and at Yale University from 1992 to 1998, teaching courses exploring the history of reading, writing, and performance from the Renaissance to the digital age. In another leadership position, she served as the director for the Tri-College Digital Humanities Initiative, a collaboration of faculty, students and staff from Bryn Mawr, Haverford and Swarthmore Colleges as well as the Mellon Tri-College Faculty Forum, a group supporting collaboration between the three colleges\u2019 faculty members.[10] An entrepreneur, Rowe is also the co-founder and was chief executive officer of Luminary Digital Media, an organization responsible for creating social reading apps in partnership with the Folger Library Shakespeare editions on the iPad.[11]\n\n\n\n![](image)Rowe (seated, green sash) at the College of William & Mary's 2023 homecoming parade\nRowe and her husband, Bruce Jacobson, a telecom entrepreneur, co-founded the nonprofit Boston Ultimate Disc Alliance and Rowe co-founded the Carleton College women's Ultimate team. As a player, Rowe was a World Ultimate Club Finalist and a Women's National Finalist.[12] She has served as an Ultimate coach for more than a decade and led multiple teams to state championships in Pennsylvania.[13] It was also through Ultimate that Rowe met and married Jacobson.[14]\n\n\nRowe received a bachelor's degree in English and American literature from Carleton College in 1984. She earned a master's and a Ph.D. in English and American literature from Harvard University. Mid-career, Rowe completed graduate work in Cinema and Media Studies at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts. She is the recipient of grants from the National Endowment for Humanities, the Mellon Foundation, and the Pennsylvania Department of Education. Rowe also served as President [15] of the Shakespeare Association of America and the Associate General Editor of *The Cambridge Guide to the Worlds of Cambridge*. She also served on Harvard University's Board of Overseers\u2019 Visiting Committee of the Library and on the Executive Committee of the American Council of Learned Societies. She has also been a member of the Modern Language Association, International Shakespeare Association and the Society for Cinema and Media Studies.[16] She was inducted into Omicron Delta Kappa - The National Leadership Honor Society, in 2018 at William & Mary.\n\n\nRowe and Bruce Jacobson have two adult children.[17]\n\n\n\n## Selected works\n\n[edit]\n\n* *New Wave Shakespeare on Screen with Thomas Cartelli* (Polity Press, 2007) ISBN\u00a0978-0745633923\n* *Reading the Early Modern Passions: Essays in the Cultural History of Emotion* (Penn Press, 2004) ISBN\u00a0978-0812218725\n* *Dead Hands: Fictions of Agency, Renaissance to Modern* (Stanford UP, 1999) ISBN\u00a0978-0804733854\n\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n1. **^** \"Katherine A.
