It was the first time since 1986 that none of the five films in that category were among the top ten releases in box office prior to the nominations announcement.[40] Furthermore, before the ceremony, all five films sold the lowest cumulative number of tickets sold since 1984.[41] *Ray* was the highest-grossing film among the Best Picture nominees with $73\u00a0million in domestic box office receipts. The film was followed by *The Aviator* ($58.4\u00a0million), *Finding Neverland* ($32.7\u00a0million), *Sideways* ($32.4\u00a0million), and finally *Million Dollar Baby* ($8.4\u00a0million).[42] The combined gross of the five Best Picture nominees when the Oscars were announced was $205\u00a0million with an average gross of $41.3\u00a0million per film.[42]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe winners were announced during the awards ceremony on February 27, 2005.[10] At age 74, Clint Eastwood became the oldest winner for Best Director in Oscar history.[11] With his latest unsuccessful nomination for directing *The Aviator*, nominee Martin Scorsese joined Robert Altman, Clarence Brown, Alfred Hitchcock, and King Vidor as the most nominated individuals in the Best Director category without a single win at the time.[12] Best Actor winner Jamie Foxx became the third actor and tenth individual overall to earn two acting nominations in the same year.[13] By virtue of her portrayal of Katharine Hepburn, Best Supporting Actress winner Cate Blanchett was the first performer to win an Oscar for a portrayal of a previous Oscar winner.[14] \"Al otro lado del r\u00edo\" from *The Motorcycle Diaries* became the second song with non-English lyrics to win Best Original Song. The first to achieve this feat was the titular song from the 1960 Greek film *Never on Sunday* at the 33rd Academy Awards.[15]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Nominations\n | Film\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 11\n | *The Aviator* |\n| 7\n | *Finding Neverland* |\n| *Million Dollar Baby* |\n| 6\n | *Ray* |\n| 5\n | *Sideways* |\n| 4\n | *The Incredibles* |\n| *Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events* |\n| 3\n | *Hotel Rwanda* |\n| *The Passion of the Christ* |\n| *The Phantom of the Opera* |\n| *The Polar Express* |\n| *Spider-Man 2* |\n| *Vera Drake* |\n| 2\n | *The Chorus* |\n| *Closer* |\n| *Collateral* |\n| *Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind* |\n| *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban* |\n| *The Motorcycle Diaries* |\n| *The Sea Inside* |\n| *Shrek 2* |\n| *A Very Long Engagement* |\n\n | The following four films received multiple awards:\n\n\n| Awards\n | Film\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 5\n | *The Aviator* |\n| 4\n | *Million Dollar Baby* |\n| 2\n | *The Incredibles* |\n| *Ray* |\n\n\n |\n\n## Presenters and performers[edit]\n\n\nThe following individuals, listed in order of appearance, presented awards or performed musical numbers.[19][20][21][22]\n\n\n\n### Presenters[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t+ *Finding Neverland*\u00a0\u2013 Art Direction: Gemma Jackson; Set Decoration: Trisha Edwards\n\t+ *Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events*\u00a0\u2013 Art Direction: Rick Heinrichs; Set Decoration: Cheryl Carasik\n\t+ *The Phantom of the Opera*\u00a0\u2013 Art Direction: Anthony Pratt; Set Decoration: Celia Bobak\n\t+ *A Very Long Engagement*\u00a0\u2013 Art Direction and Set Decoration: Aline Bonetto\n | **Best Cinematography**\n* ***The Aviator*\u00a0\u2013 Robert Richardson**\u2021\n\t+ *House of Flying Daggers*\u00a0\u2013 Zhao Xiaoding\n\t+ *The Passion of the Christ*\u00a0\u2013 Caleb Deschanel\n\t+ *The Phantom of the Opera*\u00a0\u2013 John Mathieson\n\t+ *A Very Long Engagement*\u00a0\u2013 Bruno Delbonnel\n |\n| **Best Makeup**\n* ***Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events*\u00a0\u2013 Valli O'Reilly and Bill Corso**\u2021\n\t+ *The Passion of the Christ*\u00a0\u2013 Keith VanderLaan and Christien Tinsley\n\t+ *The Sea Inside*\u00a0\u2013 Jo Allen and Manolo Garc\u00eda\n | **Best Costume Design**\n* ***The Aviator*\u00a0\u2013 Sandy Powell**\u2021\n\t+ *Finding Neverland*\u00a0\u2013 Alexandra Byrne\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t+ *Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events*\u00a0\u2013 Colleen Atwood\n\t+ *Ray*\u00a0\u2013 Sharen Davis\n\t+ *Troy*\u00a0\u2013 Bob Ringwood\n |\n| **Best Film Editing**\n* ***The Aviator*\u00a0\u2013 Thelma Schoonmaker**\u2021\n\t+ *Collateral*\u00a0\u2013 Jim Miller and Paul Rubell\n\t+ *Finding Neverland*\u00a0\u2013 Matt Chess\u00e9\n\t+ *Million Dollar Baby*\u00a0\u2013 Joel Cox\n\t+ *Ray*\u00a0\u2013 Paul Hirsch\n | **Best Visual Effects**\n* ***Spider-Man 2*\u00a0\u2013 John Dykstra, Scott Stokdyk, Anthony LaMolinara and John Frazier**\u2021\n\t+ *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban*\u00a0\u2013 Roger Guyett, Tim Burke, John Richardson and Bill George\n\t+ *I, Robot*\u00a0\u2013 John Nelson, Andrew R.

On February 20, 2010, in a ceremony at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Beverly Hills, California, the Academy Awards for Technical Achievement were presented by host Elizabeth Banks.[10]\n\n\n*The Hurt Locker* won six awards, including Best Picture.[11][12] Other winners were *Avatar* with three awards, *Crazy Heart*, *Precious: Based on the Novel 'Push' by Sapphire*, and *Up* with two, and *The Blind Side*, *The Cove*, *Inglourious Basterds*, *Logorama*, *Music by Prudence*, *The New Tenants*, *The Secret in Their Eyes*, *Star Trek*, and *The Young Victoria* with one. The telecast garnered nearly 42 million viewers in the United States, making it the most watched Oscar telecast since the 77th Academy Awards in 2005.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Kathryn Bigelow, Best Director winner and Best Picture co-winner\n![](image)Jeff Bridges, Best Actor winner\n![](image)Sandra Bullock, Best Actress winner\n![](image)Christoph Waltz, Best Supporting Actor winner\n![](image)Mo'Nique, Best Supporting Actress winner\n![](image)Mark Boal, Best Original Screenplay winner\n![](image)Pete Docter, Best Animated Feature winner\n![](image)Fisher Stevens, Best Documentary Feature co-winner\n![](image)Roger Ross Williams, Best Documentary Short Subject co-winner\n![](image)Michael Giacchino, Best Original Score winner\n![](image)Ray Beckett, Best Sound Mixing co-winner\n![](image)Sandy Powell, Best Costume Design winner\nWinners are listed first, highlighted in **boldface** and indicated with a double dagger (\u2021).[20]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n## Winners and nominees\n\n[edit]\n\nThe nominees for the 82nd Academy Awards were announced on February 2, 2010, at 5:38\u00a0a.m. PST (13:38 UTC) at the Samuel Goldwyn Theater in Beverly Hills, California, by Tom Sherak, president of the Academy, and actress Anne Hathaway.[13] *Avatar* and *The Hurt Locker* led the nominations with nine each.[14]\n\n\nThe winners were announced during the awards ceremony on March 7, 2010.[15][16][17] Kathryn Bigelow made history as the first female to win the Oscar for Best Director.[18] *Up* became the second animated film to be nominated for Best Picture after 1991's *Beauty and the Beast*.[14] Best Adapted Screenplay winner Geoffrey Fletcher was the first African American winner of a screenwriting Oscar.[19]\n\n\n\n### Awards\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Best Picture**\n* ***The Hurt Locker* \u00a0\u2013 Kathryn Bigelow, Mark Boal, Nicolas Chartier and Greg Shapiro, producers**\u2021\n\t+ *Avatar* \u00a0\u2013 James Cameron and Jon Landau, producers\n\t+ *The Blind Side* \u00a0\u2013 Gil Netter, Andrew A.

A cause of this was required a change in the voting system from first-past-the-post to alternative vote.[26]\n\n\nChoreographer Adam Shankman and Bill Mechanic were hired as producers for the ceremony. Shankman revealed in an interview on NPR's *Fresh Air* that he and Mechanic had originally chosen Sacha Baron Cohen as the host, but the Academy rejected this proposal because Baron Cohen was \"too much of a wild card.\"[27]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n26. **^** Smith, Neil (March 1, 2010). \"BBC News: Oscars 2010: Best picture voting changes explained\". *BBC News*.

The ceremony was scheduled after its usual late-February date to avoid conflicting with the 2010 Winter Olympics.[7] During the ceremony, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences presented Academy Awards (commonly referred to as Oscars) in 24 categories. The ceremony was televised in the United States by ABC, and was produced by Bill Mechanic and Adam Shankman and directed by Hamish Hamilton. Actors Alec Baldwin and Steve Martin hosted the show. Martin hosted for the third time; he first presided over the 73rd ceremony held in 2001 and last hosted the 75th ceremony held in 2003. Meanwhile, this was Baldwin's first Oscars hosting stint. This was also the first telecast to have multiple hosts since the 59th ceremony held in 1987.[8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n11. **^** Marszalek, Keith I.

Five of the nominees had grossed over $100\u00a0million before the nominations were announced.[32] Many critics, reporters, and entertainment industry analysts cite the AMPAS's decision to expand the roster of Best Picture nominees from five to ten films as one of the reasons for this.[32][33]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMany of the previous year's well-received elements returned. Five actors with a personal connection with each of the nominees presented the Best Actor and Best Actress awards. Shankman and Mechanic announced their intention to make the running time of the telecast shorter.[28] Most presenters this year introduced each winner with the phrase \"And the winner is ...\" rather than \"And the Oscar goes to...\" for the first time since 1988. The Academy gave no reason for the change to a phrase which it had once felt humiliating to the other nominees; but apparently acquiesced in Shankman and Mechanic's decision to return to the older phrase.[29] David Rockwell's proscenium curtain, decorated with 100,000 Swarovski crystals, was reused as part of the stage design for this year's telecast.[30] Unlike most Oscar ceremonies, however, Mechanic and Shankman announced that none of the five songs nominated for Best Original Song would be performed live.[31]\n\n\n\n### Box office performance of nominated films\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n31. **^** Finke, Nikki (February 17, 2010). \"Oscar Spoilers: Best Original Song Artists Not Performing\". *Deadline Hollywood Daily*.
