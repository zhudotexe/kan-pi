It was the first time since 1986 that none of the five films in that category were among the top ten releases in box office prior to the nominations announcement.[40] Furthermore, before the ceremony, all five films sold the lowest cumulative number of tickets sold since 1984.[41] *Ray* was the highest-grossing film among the Best Picture nominees with $73 million in domestic box office receipts. The film was followed by *The Aviator* ($58.4 million), *Finding Neverland* ($32.7 million), *Sideways* ($32.4 million), and finally *Million Dollar Baby* ($8.4 million).[42] The combined gross of the five Best Picture nominees when the Oscars were announced was $205 million with an average gross of $41.3 million per film.[42]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe winners were announced during the awards ceremony on February 27, 2005.[10] At age 74, Clint Eastwood became the oldest winner for Best Director in Oscar history.[11] With his latest unsuccessful nomination for directing *The Aviator*, nominee Martin Scorsese joined Robert Altman, Clarence Brown, Alfred Hitchcock, and King Vidor as the most nominated individuals in the Best Director category without a single win at the time.[12] Best Actor winner Jamie Foxx became the third actor and tenth individual overall to earn two acting nominations in the same year.[13] By virtue of her portrayal of Katharine Hepburn, Best Supporting Actress winner Cate Blanchett was the first performer to win an Oscar for a portrayal of a previous Oscar winner.[14] \"Al otro lado del río\" from *The Motorcycle Diaries* became the second song with non-English lyrics to win Best Original Song. The first to achieve this feat was the titular song from the 1960 Greek film *Never on Sunday* at the 33rd Academy Awards.[15]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Nominations\n | Film\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 11\n | *The Aviator* |\n| 7\n | *Finding Neverland* |\n| *Million Dollar Baby* |\n| 6\n | *Ray* |\n| 5\n | *Sideways* |\n| 4\n | *The Incredibles* |\n| *Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events* |\n| 3\n | *Hotel Rwanda* |\n| *The Passion of the Christ* |\n| *The Phantom of the Opera* |\n| *The Polar Express* |\n| *Spider-Man 2* |\n| *Vera Drake* |\n| 2\n | *The Chorus* |\n| *Closer* |\n| *Collateral* |\n| *Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind* |\n| *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban* |\n| *The Motorcycle Diaries* |\n| *The Sea Inside* |\n| *Shrek 2* |\n| *A Very Long Engagement* |\n\n | The following four films received multiple awards:\n\n\n| Awards\n | Film\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 5\n | *The Aviator* |\n| 4\n | *Million Dollar Baby* |\n| 2\n | *The Incredibles* |\n| *Ray* |\n\n\n |\n\n## Presenters and performers[edit]\n\n\nThe following individuals, listed in order of appearance, presented awards or performed musical numbers.[19][20][21][22]\n\n\n\n### Presenters[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t+ *Finding Neverland* – Art Direction: Gemma Jackson; Set Decoration: Trisha Edwards\n\t+ *Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events* – Art Direction: Rick Heinrichs; Set Decoration: Cheryl Carasik\n\t+ *The Phantom of the Opera* – Art Direction: Anthony Pratt; Set Decoration: Celia Bobak\n\t+ *A Very Long Engagement* – Art Direction and Set Decoration: Aline Bonetto\n | **Best Cinematography**\n* ***The Aviator* – Robert Richardson**‡\n\t+ *House of Flying Daggers* – Zhao Xiaoding\n\t+ *The Passion of the Christ* – Caleb Deschanel\n\t+ *The Phantom of the Opera* – John Mathieson\n\t+ *A Very Long Engagement* – Bruno Delbonnel\n |\n| **Best Makeup**\n* ***Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events* – Valli O'Reilly and Bill Corso**‡\n\t+ *The Passion of the Christ* – Keith VanderLaan and Christien Tinsley\n\t+ *The Sea Inside* – Jo Allen and Manolo García\n | **Best Costume Design**\n* ***The Aviator* – Sandy Powell**‡\n\t+ *Finding Neverland* – Alexandra Byrne\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t+ *Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events* – Colleen Atwood\n\t+ *Ray* – Sharen Davis\n\t+ *Troy* – Bob Ringwood\n |\n| **Best Film Editing**\n* ***The Aviator* – Thelma Schoonmaker**‡\n\t+ *Collateral* – Jim Miller and Paul Rubell\n\t+ *Finding Neverland* – Matt Chessé\n\t+ *Million Dollar Baby* – Joel Cox\n\t+ *Ray* – Paul Hirsch\n | **Best Visual Effects**\n* ***Spider-Man 2* – John Dykstra, Scott Stokdyk, Anthony LaMolinara and John Frazier**‡\n\t+ *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban* – Roger Guyett, Tim Burke, John Richardson and Bill George\n\t+ *I, Robot* – John Nelson, Andrew R.

The ceremony was scheduled after its usual late-February date to avoid conflicting with the 2010 Winter Olympics.[7] During the ceremony, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences presented Academy Awards (commonly referred to as Oscars) in 24 categories. The ceremony was televised in the United States by ABC, and was produced by Bill Mechanic and Adam Shankman and directed by Hamish Hamilton. Actors Alec Baldwin and Steve Martin hosted the show. Martin hosted for the third time; he first presided over the 73rd ceremony held in 2001 and last hosted the 75th ceremony held in 2003. Meanwhile, this was Baldwin's first Oscars hosting stint. This was also the first telecast to have multiple hosts since the 59th ceremony held in 1987.[8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n11. **^** Marszalek, Keith I.

Five of the nominees had grossed over $100 million before the nominations were announced.[32] Many critics, reporters, and entertainment industry analysts cite the AMPAS's decision to expand the roster of Best Picture nominees from five to ten films as one of the reasons for this.[32][33]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMany of the previous year's well-received elements returned. Five actors with a personal connection with each of the nominees presented the Best Actor and Best Actress awards. Shankman and Mechanic announced their intention to make the running time of the telecast shorter.[28] Most presenters this year introduced each winner with the phrase \"And the winner is ...\" rather than \"And the Oscar goes to...\" for the first time since 1988. The Academy gave no reason for the change to a phrase which it had once felt humiliating to the other nominees; but apparently acquiesced in Shankman and Mechanic's decision to return to the older phrase.[29] David Rockwell's proscenium curtain, decorated with 100,000 Swarovski crystals, was reused as part of the stage design for this year's telecast.[30] Unlike most Oscar ceremonies, however, Mechanic and Shankman announced that none of the five songs nominated for Best Original Song would be performed live.[31]\n\n\n\n### Box office performance of nominated films\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n31. **^** Finke, Nikki (February 17, 2010). \"Oscar Spoilers: Best Original Song Artists Not Performing\". *Deadline Hollywood Daily*.
