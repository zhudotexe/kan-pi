The Pacific Plate is seismically active beneath Denali, a tectonic region that is known as the \"McKinley cluster\".[14]\n\n\nDenali has a summit elevation of 20,310 feet (6,190\u00a0m) above sea level, making it the highest peak in North America and the northernmost mountain above 19,685 feet (6,000\u00a0m) elevation in the world.[1] Measured from base to peak at some 18,000\u00a0ft (5,500\u00a0m), it is among the largest mountains situated entirely above sea level. Denali rises from a sloping plain with elevations from 1,000 to 3,000\u00a0ft (300 to 910\u00a0m), for a base-to-peak height of 17,000 to 19,000\u00a0ft (5,000 to 6,000\u00a0m).[15]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Denali |\n| --- |\n| ![A snow-covered, gently sloping mountain is in the background, with a lake in the foreground](image)From the north, with Wonder Lake in the foreground\n |\n| Highest\u00a0point |\n| Elevation | 20,310 ft (6,190 m) top of snow[1][2]NAVD88 |\n| Prominence | 20,194\u00a0ft (6,155\u00a0m)[3] |\n| Parent peak | Aconcagua[3] |\n| Isolation | 4,621.1\u00a0mi (7,436.9\u00a0km)[3] |\n| Listing | * World's most prominent peaks 3rd\n* World's most isolated peaks 3rd\n* Continent high points 3rd\n* Country high points 14th\n* North America highest peaks 1st\n* US highest major peaks 1st\n* Alaska highest major peaks 1st\n* U.S. state high points 1st\n |\n| Coordinates | 63\u00b004\u203210\u2033N 151\u00b000\u203227\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff63.0695\u00b0N 151.0074\u00b0W\ufeff / 63.0695; -151.0074[4] |\n| Geography |\n| ![Denali is located in Alaska](image)![Denali](image)\nDenali\nAlaska\n |\n| Location | Denali National Park and Preserve, Alaska, U.S. |\n| Parent range | Alaska Range |\n| Topo map | USGS Mt.

It is the tallest mountain in the world from base-to-peak on land, measuring 18,000\u00a0ft (5,500\u00a0m),[8] and Earth's highest mountain north of 43\u00b0N. With a topographic prominence of 20,194 feet (6,155\u00a0m)[3] and a topographic isolation of 4,621.1 miles (7,436.9\u00a0km),[3] Denali is the third most prominent and third-most isolated peak on Earth, after Mount Everest and Aconcagua. Located in the Alaska Range in the interior of the U.S. state of Alaska, Denali is the centerpiece of Denali National Park and Preserve.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBy comparison, Mount Everest rises from the Tibetan Plateau at a much higher base elevation. Base elevations for Everest range from 13,800\u00a0ft (4,200\u00a0m) on the south side to 17,100\u00a0ft (5,200\u00a0m) on the Tibetan Plateau, for a base-to-peak height in the range of 12,000 to 15,300\u00a0ft (3,700 to 4,700\u00a0m).[16] Denali's base-to-peak height is little more than half the 33,500\u00a0ft (10,200\u00a0m) of the volcano Mauna Kea, which lies mostly under water.[17]\n\n\n\n### Geography of the mountain[edit]\n\n\nDenali has two significant summits: the South Summit is the higher one, while the North Summit has an elevation of 19,470\u00a0ft (5,934\u00a0m)[12] and a prominence of approximately 1,270\u00a0ft (387\u00a0m).[18] The North Summit is sometimes counted as a separate peak (see e.g., fourteener) and sometimes not; it is rarely climbed, except by those doing routes on the north side of the massif.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWilliam Dickey, a New Hampshire-born resident of Seattle, Washington who had been digging for gold in the sands of the Susitna River, wrote, after his returning from Alaska, an account in the *New York Sun* that appeared on January 24, 1897.[42] His report drew attention with the sentence \"We have no doubt that this peak is the highest in North America, and estimate that it is over 20,000 feet (6,100\u00a0m) high.\" Until then, Mount Logan in Canada's Yukon Territory was believed to be the continent's highest point. Though later praised for his estimate, Dickey admitted that other prospector parties had also guessed the mountain to be over 20,000 feet (6,100\u00a0m).[43] These estimates were confirmed in 1898 by the surveyor Robert Muldrow, who measured its elevation as 20,300 feet (6,200\u00a0m).[44]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n53.

The mountain is about 90 miles (140\u00a0km) east of El Paso and about 50 miles (80\u00a0km) southwest of Carlsbad, New Mexico. The peak rises more than 3,000 feet (910\u00a0m) above the arid floor of the Chihuahuan Desert.\n\n\n\n\n## Trail and summit[edit]\n\n\nThe peak can be climbed at any time of the year by a maintained stony trail (4.25 miles or 6.8 kilometers each way) with a 3,000-foot (910\u00a0m) elevation gain.[5] The trail is part of the network of hiking trails in the surrounding national park.\n\n\nA stainless steel pyramid marks the summit. It was erected by American Airlines in 1958 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Butterfield Overland Mail, a stagecoach route that passed south of the mountain. One side of the pyramid has the American Airlines logo. The second side displays a U.S. Postal Service tribute to the Pony Express Riders of the Butterfield Stage. The third side displays a compass with the logo of the Boy Scouts of America. \n\n\n\n![](image)\nGuadalupe Peak from Hunter Peak\n\n\nA hiker was found dead on New Year's Eve 2022, as there were wind gusts of more than 50 miles (80\u00a0km) per hour and wind chills were \"well below freezing\" that day, according to the release.\n\n\n\"At nearly 9,000 feet (2,700\u00a0m) above sea level, Guadalupe Peak is a mountain environment with associated risks not found elsewhere in Texas,\" the park said, noting that the hike is a \"very strenuous, 8.4-mile (13.5\u00a0km) round trip hike with a 3,000-foot (910\u00a0m) elevation gain\" to the highest point in the state.\n\n\n\n## Gallery[edit]\n\n\n* ![View west from top of peak.](image)\n\nView west from top of peak.\n* ![Salt Flats from summit.](image)\n\nSalt Flats from summit.\n* ![Guadalupe Mountains in sunset.](image)\n\nGuadalupe Mountains in sunset.\n* ![Hiking trail up the peak.](image)\n\nHiking trail up the peak.\n* ![High elevation (8,100 feet (2,500\u00a0m)) campground near summit.](image)\n\nHigh elevation (8,100 feet (2,500\u00a0m)) campground near summit.\n* ![Culberson County, Texas, from the summit.](image)\n\nCulberson County, Texas, from the summit.\n* ![The pyramid at the summit.](image)\n\nThe pyramid at the summit.\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![map](image)North America portal\n* ![flag](image)United States portal\n* ![flag](image)Texas portal\n* ![icon](image)Mountains portal\n\n\n* List of mountain peaks of North America\n\t+ List of mountain peaks of the United States\n\t\t- List of U.S. states by elevation\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** \"El Capitan\". *NGS Data Sheet*.

In 1871, King returned to climb what he believed to be Whitney, but having taken a different approach, he actually summited nearby Mount Langley. Upon learning of his mistake in 1873, King finally completed his own first ascent of Whitney, but did so a month too late to be first.[24] On August 18, 1873, Charles Begole, A. H. Johnson, and John Lucas, all of nearby Lone Pine, had become the first to reach the contiguous United States' highest summit. As they climbed the mountain during a fishing trip to nearby Kern Canyon, they called the mountain Fisherman's Peak.[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSouth of the main summit is a series of minor summits that are completely inconspicuous from the west but appear as a series of \"needles\" from the east. The routes on these include some of the finest big-wall climbing in the high Sierra. Two of the needles were named after participants in an 1880 scientific expedition to the mountain: Keeler Needle for James Keeler and Day Needle for William Cathcart Day. The latter has been renamed Crooks Peak after Hulda Crooks, who hiked up Mount Whitney every year until well into her nineties.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Mountains portal\n* ![flag](image)California portal\n\n\n* List of mountain peaks of California\n* List of highest points in California by county\n* List of U.S. states by elevation\n* List of the highest major summits of the United States\n* List of the most prominent summits of the United States\n* List of the most isolated major summits of the United States\n* Whitney Classic\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nShow map of California\n![Mount Whitney is located in the United States](image)![Mount Whitney](image)\nMount Whitney\nShow map of the United States\n |\n| Location | * Sequoia National Park\n* Inyo National Forest\n* Sequoia-Kings Canyon Wilderness\n* John Muir Wilderness\n* Inyo and Tulare counties, California, U.S.\n |\n| Parent range | Sierra Nevada |\n| Topo map | USGS Mount Whitney |\n| Geology |\n| Age of rock | Cretaceous |\n| Mountain type | Granite |\n| Climbing |\n| First ascent | August 18, 1873 by Charles Begole, Albert Johnson, and John Lucas[7] |\n| Easiest route | Mount Whitney Trail (class\u00a01) |\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

This weather station was designed to transmit data in real-time for use by the climbing public and the science community. Since its establishment, annual upgrades to the equipment have been performed with instrumentation custom built for the extreme weather and altitude conditions. This weather station is the third-highest weather station in the world.[101]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBy comparison, Mount Everest rises from the Tibetan Plateau at a much higher base elevation. Base elevations for Everest range from 13,800\u00a0ft (4,200\u00a0m) on the south side to 17,100\u00a0ft (5,200\u00a0m) on the Tibetan Plateau, for a base-to-peak height in the range of 12,000 to 15,300\u00a0ft (3,700 to 4,700\u00a0m).[16] Denali's base-to-peak height is little more than half the 33,500\u00a0ft (10,200\u00a0m) of the volcano Mauna Kea, which lies mostly under water.[17]\n\n\n\n### Geography of the mountain[edit]\n\n\nDenali has two significant summits: the South Summit is the higher one, while the North Summit has an elevation of 19,470\u00a0ft (5,934\u00a0m)[12] and a prominence of approximately 1,270\u00a0ft (387\u00a0m).[18] The North Summit is sometimes counted as a separate peak (see e.g., fourteener) and sometimes not; it is rarely climbed, except by those doing routes on the north side of the massif.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1903, James Wickersham recorded the first attempt at climbing Denali, which was unsuccessful. In 1906, Frederick Cook claimed the first ascent, but this ascent is unverified and its legitimacy questioned. The first verifiable ascent to Denali's summit was achieved on June 7, 1913, by climbers Hudson Stuck, Harry Karstens, Walter Harper, and Robert Tatum, who went by the South Summit. In 1951, Bradford Washburn pioneered the West Buttress route, considered to be the safest and easiest route, and therefore the most popular currently in use.[11]\n\n\nOn September 2, 2015, the U.S. Geological Survey announced that the mountain is 20,310 feet (6,190\u00a0m) high,[1] not 20,320 feet (6,194\u00a0m), as measured in 1952 using photogrammetry.\n\n\n\n\n## Geology and features[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n7. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Mr. Wyden, from the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources (September 10, 2013). \"Senate Report 113-93 \u2013 Designation of Denali in the State of Alaska\".

Though later praised for his estimate, Dickey admitted that other prospector parties had also guessed the mountain to be over 20,000 feet (6,100\u00a0m).[43] These estimates were confirmed in 1898 by the surveyor Robert Muldrow, who measured its elevation as 20,300 feet (6,200\u00a0m).[44]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)An aerial photo Denali in 1987\nThe Koyukon people who inhabit the area around the mountain have referred to the peak as \"Denali\" for centuries.

The mountain is about 90 miles (140\u00a0km) east of El Paso and about 50 miles (80\u00a0km) southwest of Carlsbad, New Mexico. The peak rises more than 3,000 feet (910\u00a0m) above the arid floor of the Chihuahuan Desert.\n\n\n\n\n## Trail and summit[edit]\n\n\nThe peak can be climbed at any time of the year by a maintained stony trail (4.25 miles or 6.8 kilometers each way) with a 3,000-foot (910\u00a0m) elevation gain.[5] The trail is part of the network of hiking trails in the surrounding national park.\n\n\nA stainless steel pyramid marks the summit. It was erected by American Airlines in 1958 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Butterfield Overland Mail, a stagecoach route that passed south of the mountain. One side of the pyramid has the American Airlines logo. The second side displays a U.S. Postal Service tribute to the Pony Express Riders of the Butterfield Stage. The third side displays a compass with the logo of the Boy Scouts of America. \n\n\n\n![](image)\nGuadalupe Peak from Hunter Peak\n\n\nA hiker was found dead on New Year's Eve 2022, as there were wind gusts of more than 50 miles (80\u00a0km) per hour and wind chills were \"well below freezing\" that day, according to the release.\n\n\n\"At nearly 9,000 feet (2,700\u00a0m) above sea level, Guadalupe Peak is a mountain environment with associated risks not found elsewhere in Texas,\" the park said, noting that the hike is a \"very strenuous, 8.4-mile (13.5\u00a0km) round trip hike with a 3,000-foot (910\u00a0m) elevation gain\" to the highest point in the state.\n\n\n\n## Gallery[edit]\n\n\n* ![View west from top of peak.](image)\n\nView west from top of peak.\n* ![Salt Flats from summit.](image)\n\nSalt Flats from summit.\n* ![Guadalupe Mountains in sunset.](image)\n\nGuadalupe Mountains in sunset.\n* ![Hiking trail up the peak.](image)\n\nHiking trail up the peak.\n* ![High elevation (8,100 feet (2,500\u00a0m)) campground near summit.](image)\n\nHigh elevation (8,100 feet (2,500\u00a0m)) campground near summit.\n* ![Culberson County, Texas, from the summit.](image)\n\nCulberson County, Texas, from the summit.\n* ![The pyramid at the summit.](image)\n\nThe pyramid at the summit.\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![map](image)North America portal\n* ![flag](image)United States portal\n* ![flag](image)Texas portal\n* ![icon](image)Mountains portal\n\n\n* List of mountain peaks of North America\n\t+ List of mountain peaks of the United States\n\t\t- List of U.S. states by elevation\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** \"El Capitan\". *NGS Data Sheet*.

For the former town with this name, see Lone Pine Station, California. For the ship, see USS Mount Whitney (LCC-20).\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe mountain is the highest point on the Great Basin Divide. Waterways on the peak's west side flow into Whitney Creek, which flows into the Kern River. The Kern River terminates at Bakersfield in the Tulare Basin, the southern part of the San Joaquin Valley. Today, the water in the Tulare Basin is largely diverted for agriculture. Historically, during very wet years, water overflowed from the Tulare Basin into the San Joaquin River, which flows to the Pacific Ocean.\n\n\nFrom the east, water from Mount Whitney flows to Lone Pine Creek, where most of the water is diverted into the Los Angeles Aqueduct via a sluice. Some water in the creek is allowed to continue on its natural course, joining the Owens River, which terminates at Owens Lake, an endorheic lake of the Great Basin.\n\n\n\n### Elevation measurements[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSouth of the main summit is a series of minor summits that are completely inconspicuous from the west but appear as a series of \"needles\" from the east. The routes on these include some of the finest big-wall climbing in the high Sierra. Two of the needles were named after participants in an 1880 scientific expedition to the mountain: Keeler Needle for James Keeler and Day Needle for William Cathcart Day. The latter has been renamed Crooks Peak after Hulda Crooks, who hiked up Mount Whitney every year until well into her nineties.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Mountains portal\n* ![flag](image)California portal\n\n\n* List of mountain peaks of California\n* List of highest points in California by county\n* List of U.S. states by elevation\n* List of the highest major summits of the United States\n* List of the most prominent summits of the United States\n* List of the most isolated major summits of the United States\n* Whitney Classic\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** \n\"Whitney\". *NGS Data Sheet*.

In 1871, King returned to climb what he believed to be Whitney, but having taken a different approach, he actually summited nearby Mount Langley. Upon learning of his mistake in 1873, King finally completed his own first ascent of Whitney, but did so a month too late to be first.[24] On August 18, 1873, Charles Begole, A. H. Johnson, and John Lucas, all of nearby Lone Pine, had become the first to reach the contiguous United States' highest summit. As they climbed the mountain during a fishing trip to nearby Kern Canyon, they called the mountain Fisherman's Peak.[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Peaks >14,000 ft | * Whitney\n* Williamson\n* North Palisade\n* Sill\n* Russell\n* Split\n* Langley\n* Tyndall\n* Muir\n* Middle Palisade\n | ![](image)\n |\n| Northern peaks | * Lola\n* Castle\n* Granite Chief\n* Rose\n* Tallac\n* Pyramid\n* Freel\n |\n| Central peaks | * Red Lake\n* Round Top\n* Mokelumne\n* Sonora\n* Leavitt\n* Dana\n* Lyell\n* Banner\n* Ritter\n* Mammoth\n |\n| Southern peaks | * Humphreys\n* Tom\n* Bear Creek Spire\n* Darwin\n* Agassiz\n* Kaweah\n* Brewer\n* Olancha\n* Kern\n* Double\n |\n| Climbing | * Peak list\n* First ascents\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n13. **^** Perlman, Eric (May 1985). \"Nice Going, Whitney\". *Backpager*: 49\u201355.

The technology of elevation measurement has become more refined and, more importantly, the vertical coordinate system has changed. The peak was commonly said to be at 14,494\u00a0ft (4,418\u00a0m) and this is the elevation stamped on the USGS brass benchmark disk on the summit. An older plaque on the summit (sheet metal with black lettering on white enamel) reads \"elevation 14,496.811 feet\", but this was estimated using the older vertical datum (NGVD29) from 1929. Since then the shape of the Earth (the geoid) has been estimated more accurately. Using a new vertical datum established in 1988 (NAVD88) the benchmark is now estimated to be 14,505\u00a0ft (4,421\u00a0m).[1][16]\n\n\n\n## Geology[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nThe 126 highest major summits of greater North America\n |\n| --- |\n| 1.

Granite Peak is 10 miles (16\u00a0km) north of the Wyoming border and 45 miles (72\u00a0km) southwest of Columbus, Montana.\n\n\nGranite Peak is often considered the second most difficult state high point to climb after Denali in Alaska, due to technical climbing, poor weather, and route finding.[4][5] Granite Peak's first ascent was made by Elers Koch, James C. Whitham, and R.T. Ferguson on August 29, 1923, after several failed attempts by others. It was the last of the state high points to be climbed.[5] Today, climbers typically spend two or three days ascending the peak, stopping over on the Froze-to-Death Plateau, although some climbers choose to ascend the peak in a single day. Another route that has gained popularity in recent years is the Southwest Couloir route, a non-technical route from the south starting near Cooke City; climbers generally take two days to complete it.\n\n\n\n\n## Climate[edit]\n\n\n| Climate data for Granite Peak 45.1650 N, 109.8158 W, Elevation: 12,192\u00a0ft (3,716\u00a0m) (1991\u20132020 normals)\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Mean daily maximum \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n | 17.8(\u22127.9)\n | 16.9(\u22128.4)\n | 21.7(\u22125.7)\n | 27.2(\u22122.7)\n | 36.5(2.5)\n | 46.3(7.9)\n | 56.6(13.7)\n | 56.0(13.3)\n | 47.1(8.4)\n | 34.2(1.2)\n | 23.0(\u22125.0)\n | 17.0(\u22128.3)\n | 33.4(0.8)\n |\n| Daily mean \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n | 8.5(\u221213.1)\n | 6.8(\u221214.0)\n | 10.9(\u221211.7)\n | 15.6(\u22129.1)\n | 24.4(\u22124.2)\n | 33.5(0.8)\n | 42.5(5.8)\n | 42.0(5.6)\n | 33.9(1.1)\n | 22.8(\u22125.1)\n | 13.8(\u221210.1)\n | 8.1(\u221213.3)\n | 21.9(\u22125.6)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n | \u22120.8(\u221218.2)\n | \u22123.4(\u221219.7)\n | 0.2(\u221217.7)\n | 4.0(\u221215.6)\n | 12.2(\u221211.0)\n | 20.7(\u22126.3)\n | 28.4(\u22122.0)\n | 27.9(\u22122.3)\n | 20.7(\u22126.3)\n | 11.5(\u221211.4)\n | 4.6(\u221215.2)\n | \u22120.9(\u221218.3)\n | 10.4(\u221212.0)\n |\n| Average precipitation inches (mm)\n | 6.87(174)\n | 6.61(168)\n | 6.59(167)\n | 6.24(158)\n | 5.44(138)\n | 4.55(116)\n | 3.23(82)\n | 2.68(68)\n | 2.88(73)\n | 4.53(115)\n | 6.52(166)\n | 7.50(191)\n | 63.64(1,616)\n |\n| Source: PRISM Climate Group[6] |\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n![](image)Froze-to-Death Plateau, on the slope leading to the summit\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image) Geography portal\n* ![icon](image) Mountains portal\n* List of mountains in Montana\n* List of U.S. states by elevation\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** \"Granite Peak\". *NGS Data Sheet*.

It is located northeast of Taos and south of Red River in the northern part of the state, and just 2 miles (3.2\u00a0km) southeast of the ski slopes of Taos Ski Valley. It lies in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, the southernmost subrange of the Rocky Mountains. The peak's elevation is 13,167 feet (4,013\u00a0m).\n\n\nFormerly named Taos Peak, after the nearby town of Taos, New Mexico, it was renamed Wheeler Peak in 1950.[3] A plaque at the summit states that the mountain was:\n\n\n\n\n> Named in honor of Major George Montague Wheeler (1832\u20131909) who for ten years led a party of surveyors and naturalists collecting geologic, biologic, planimetric and topographic data in New Mexico and six other southwestern states.\n> \n> \n\n\n\n## Nearby peaks and features[edit]\n\n\nJust north of Wheeler Peak is Mount Walter. At 13,141 feet (4,005\u00a0m) it is the second highest named summit in New Mexico, but it is not usually considered an independent peak as it has only about 53 feet (16\u00a0m) of topographic prominence. It is sometimes mistaken for Wheeler Peak, since it is along the standard route to Wheeler. Lake Fork Peak at 12,881 feet (3,926\u00a0m) lies just across Williams Lake and to the west of Wheeler Mountain.\n\n\nTaos Ski Valley lies to the northwest of Wheeler Peak, while both the town of Taos and Taos Pueblo are about 15 miles (24\u00a0km) to the southwest. \n\n\nWheeler Peak is the focus of the 19,661-acre (79.57\u00a0km2) Wheeler Peak Wilderness area in the Carson National Forest. Much of the mountain area just south of the peak is on Taos Pueblo land. Some 48,000 acres (190\u00a0km2) was returned to the pueblo from the Carson National Forest in 1970[4]\nand another 764 acres (3.09\u00a0km2) in 1996.[5]\n\n\n\n## Climate[edit]\n\n\n| Climate data for Wheeler Peak 36.5619 N, 105.4181 W, Elevation: 12,789\u00a0ft (3,898\u00a0m) (1991\u20132020 normals)\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Mean daily maximum \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n | 27.1(\u22122.7)\n | 27.3(\u22122.6)\n | 32.3(0.2)\n | 36.1(2.3)\n | 45.3(7.4)\n | 56.5(13.6)\n | 59.9(15.5)\n | 57.7(14.3)\n | 51.7(10.9)\n | 41.8(5.4)\n | 34.0(1.1)\n | 27.4(\u22122.6)\n | 41.4(5.2)\n |\n| Daily mean \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n | 15.6(\u22129.1)\n | 15.5(\u22129.2)\n | 20.1(\u22126.6)\n | 24.4(\u22124.2)\n | 33.3(0.7)\n | 43.4(6.3)\n | 47.4(8.6)\n | 45.9(7.7)\n | 40.3(4.6)\n | 31.0(\u22120.6)\n | 23.0(\u22125.0)\n | 16.3(\u22128.7)\n | 29.7(\u22121.3)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n | 4.2(\u221215.4)\n | 3.8(\u221215.7)\n | 7.9(\u221213.4)\n | 12.7(\u221210.7)\n | 21.2(\u22126.0)\n | 30.4(\u22120.9)\n | 34.8(1.6)\n | 34.0(1.1)\n | 28.8(\u22121.8)\n | 20.2(\u22126.6)\n | 11.9(\u221211.2)\n | 5.2(\u221214.9)\n | 17.9(\u22127.8)\n |\n| Average precipitation inches (mm)\n | 3.44(87)\n | 3.23(82)\n | 4.41(112)\n | 4.13(105)\n | 3.00(76)\n | 1.34(34)\n | 3.49(89)\n | 4.10(104)\n | 3.18(81)\n | 3.08(78)\n | 3.73(95)\n | 3.69(94)\n | 40.82(1,037)\n |\n| Source: PRISM Climate Group[6] |\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n## Climbing[edit]\n\n\nThe standard route on Wheeler Peak is along the north ridge. The route starts at the parking lot for Taos Ski Valley, and proceeds east along an old road to a broad saddle at Bull-of-the-Woods Meadow. It then turns south and winds its way among minor peaks and small valleys to gain Wheeler Peak from the north, going over the summit of Mount Walter along the way. This is a practical route, even in winter, due to low (but nonzero) avalanche exposure.\n\n\nAn alternate route is to hike south from Taos Ski Valley to Williams Lake, then take a newly constructed switchback trail to the top. This trail was completed in 2011 by a Forest Service trail crew from the Gallatin National Forest, 8 people working 12 hours per day, building 4 miles of new trail with hand tools to the top in 14 days. \n\n\nAnother alternate route is to begin from the nearby ski resort of Red River. From the town of Red River drive 6.4 miles south on NM 578, then 1.3 miles on FR 58 to the trailhead parking area. From the parking area Wheeler peak is about 7 miles on Forest Trail 91. This route passes two alpine lakes, Lost Lake and Horseshoe Lake.\n\n\nWheeler Peak has a summit register as do many major western peaks.\n\n\n\n![](image)\nPanorama from Wheeler Peak\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Mountains portal\n\n\n* List of mountain peaks of North America\n\t+ List of mountain peaks of the United States\n\t\t- List of U.S. states by elevation\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Wheeler\". *NGS Data Sheet*.
