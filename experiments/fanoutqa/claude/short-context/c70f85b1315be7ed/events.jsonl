Please help improve it by revising it to be neutral and encyclopedic. *(February 2021)*\n |\n\n\nHMC employs financial professionals to manage the approximately 12,000 funds that constitute the endowment. The company directly manages about one third of the total endowment portfolio while working closely with the external companies that manage the rest.[*citation needed*] HMC is headed by a professional, who holds the titles of president and chief executive officer of the company.\n\n\nHMC is a 501(c)(3) non-profit entity[5] and so is exempt from federal income taxation.[6]\n\n\n\n### Past management[edit]\n\n\nJack Meyer managed HMC from 1990 to September 30, 2005, beginning with an endowment worth $4.8 billion and ending with a value of $25.9 billion (including new contributions). During the last decade of his tenure, the endowment earned an annualized return of 15.9%.[7] In part after compensation disagreements, a number of HMC managers including Meyer himself left to form their own investment management firms. Bloomberg in 2011 reviewed a group of the resultant firms—Adage Capital Management LP, Charlesbank Capital Partners LLC, Convexity Capital Management LP (Meyer's), Highfields Capital Management LP and Regiment Capital Advisors LLC—which at that time between them managed $43 billion in assets.[8]\n\n\nThe university hired Mohamed El-Erian to succeed Meyer as HMC's next president and CEO. He came from the bond trading company PIMCO and pledged to \"rebuild and reinvent\" the company. He announced his leaving September 12, 2007, to return to PIMCO after guiding the endowment to a one-year return of 23%.[9]\n\n\nJane Mendillo was named the new head of HMC, effective July 1, 2008. She had been Wellesley College’s chief investment officer since 2002. Prior to that, she served as vice president for external management at HMC. A 1984 graduate of Yale University followed by an MBA from Yale School of Management, Mendillo first joined HMC as an equities analyst in 1987. Her tenure was largely shaped by the financial crisis of 2007–2010, with a cash squeeze in University operation and endowment performance, a shrinkage of endowment asset value, and errant interest rate, financial derivatives and leveraged positions, according to a Feb. 2009 news report. Staff of HMC was trimmed 25%, or by about 50 people, in line with shrinkage of about $8 billion (about 22%). A source for the report said that some of the positions in the endowment which had to be liquidated were in hedge funds run by Meyer's Convexity Capital and Seth Klarman's Baupost Group.[10]\n\n\nStephen Blyth became the CEO of HMC on January 1, 2015. Blyth joined the firm in 2006, and previously held roles as Head of Internal Management and Head of Public Markets, responsible for investments in public equity, credit and fixed income markets. An alumnus of Cambridge University and Harvard University, Blyth has also served as a Professor of the Practice of Statistics at Harvard University.[11]\n\n\nMarc Seidner joined HMC as vice president for domestic fixed income in an effort to revamp the company's bond division in 2006. Mr. Seidner was previously the director of active core strategies at Standish Mellon Asset Management.[12] *The Wall Street Journal* reported on June 23, 2009, that Seidner was departing from the organization. On August 14, 2009 PIMCO announced that it had hired Seidner as an executive vice president and portfolio manager to manage a range of fixed-income portfolios.\n\n\n\n### Current management[edit]\n\n\nOn September 30, 2016, N.P. Narvekar was appointed as CEO.[13] In January 2017, Narvekar announced the company would be laying off about half of the 230-employee staff by outsourcing some positions and closing all its internally managed hedge funds by the end of the 2017 fiscal year.[14] In 2019, Narvekar was paid $9.3 million compensation.[15][16]\n\n\n\n### Harken Energy[edit]\n\n\nIn 2002, Harvard Management Company was linked to George W. Bush's Harken Energy scandal.[17][18] Specifically, Michael R. Eisenson, who would later found private equity firm Charlesbank Capital Partners was the Harvard representative on the Harken Energy board when Harvard made a $30 million investment into the ill-fated oil company venture.[19] At the time, employees were accused of improperly investing their own money into Harken but Harvard deemed those investments appropriate.[20]\n\n\n\n### Investments in Romania[edit]\n\n\nFrom 2004 to 2015 Harvard University acquired 33,600 hectares (83,000 acres) of Romanian forest land. In 2015 they abruptly sold their entire holding to a subsidiary of Ikea. These holdings have since faced significant legal challenge as many were acquired corruptly during Romania's post-Communist restitution process.[21]\n\n\n\n### Ending investments in fossil fuels[edit]\n\n\nIn September 2021, after years of pressure from student and outside groups, Harvard announced that it will stop investments in fossil fuels.[22] The university's public announcement cited \"the need to decarbonize the economy and our responsibility as fiduciaries\" in explaining its decision.[23] Climate activists on campus had waged a multi-year campaign for full divestment, including bringing lawsuits, storming the field of the 2019 Harvard-Yale football game, organizing on-campus protests, and other strategies.[24]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of colleges and universities in the United States by endowment\n* List of wealthiest charitable foundations\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Virginia L.

Please help improve it by revising it to be neutral and encyclopedic. *(February 2021)*\n |\n\n\nHMC employs financial professionals to manage the approximately 12,000 funds that constitute the endowment. The company directly manages about one third of the total endowment portfolio while working closely with the external companies that manage the rest.[*citation needed*] HMC is headed by a professional, who holds the titles of president and chief executive officer of the company.\n\n\nHMC is a 501(c)(3) non-profit entity[5] and so is exempt from federal income taxation.[6]\n\n\n\n### Past management[edit]\n\n\nJack Meyer managed HMC from 1990 to September 30, 2005, beginning with an endowment worth $4.8 billion and ending with a value of $25.9 billion (including new contributions). During the last decade of his tenure, the endowment earned an annualized return of 15.9%.[7] In part after compensation disagreements, a number of HMC managers including Meyer himself left to form their own investment management firms. Bloomberg in 2011 reviewed a group of the resultant firms—Adage Capital Management LP, Charlesbank Capital Partners LLC, Convexity Capital Management LP (Meyer's), Highfields Capital Management LP and Regiment Capital Advisors LLC—which at that time between them managed $43 billion in assets.[8]\n\n\nThe university hired Mohamed El-Erian to succeed Meyer as HMC's next president and CEO. He came from the bond trading company PIMCO and pledged to \"rebuild and reinvent\" the company. He announced his leaving September 12, 2007, to return to PIMCO after guiding the endowment to a one-year return of 23%.[9]\n\n\nJane Mendillo was named the new head of HMC, effective July 1, 2008. She had been Wellesley College’s chief investment officer since 2002. Prior to that, she served as vice president for external management at HMC. A 1984 graduate of Yale University followed by an MBA from Yale School of Management, Mendillo first joined HMC as an equities analyst in 1987. Her tenure was largely shaped by the financial crisis of 2007–2010, with a cash squeeze in University operation and endowment performance, a shrinkage of endowment asset value, and errant interest rate, financial derivatives and leveraged positions, according to a Feb. 2009 news report. Staff of HMC was trimmed 25%, or by about 50 people, in line with shrinkage of about $8 billion (about 22%). A source for the report said that some of the positions in the endowment which had to be liquidated were in hedge funds run by Meyer's Convexity Capital and Seth Klarman's Baupost Group.[10]\n\n\nStephen Blyth became the CEO of HMC on January 1, 2015. Blyth joined the firm in 2006, and previously held roles as Head of Internal Management and Head of Public Markets, responsible for investments in public equity, credit and fixed income markets. An alumnus of Cambridge University and Harvard University, Blyth has also served as a Professor of the Practice of Statistics at Harvard University.[11]\n\n\nMarc Seidner joined HMC as vice president for domestic fixed income in an effort to revamp the company's bond division in 2006. Mr. Seidner was previously the director of active core strategies at Standish Mellon Asset Management.[12] *The Wall Street Journal* reported on June 23, 2009, that Seidner was departing from the organization. On August 14, 2009 PIMCO announced that it had hired Seidner as an executive vice president and portfolio manager to manage a range of fixed-income portfolios.\n\n\n\n### Current management[edit]\n\n\nOn September 30, 2016, N.P. Narvekar was appointed as CEO.[13] In January 2017, Narvekar announced the company would be laying off about half of the 230-employee staff by outsourcing some positions and closing all its internally managed hedge funds by the end of the 2017 fiscal year.[14] In 2019, Narvekar was paid $9.3 million compensation.[15][16]\n\n\n\n### Harken Energy[edit]\n\n\nIn 2002, Harvard Management Company was linked to George W. Bush's Harken Energy scandal.[17][18] Specifically, Michael R. Eisenson, who would later found private equity firm Charlesbank Capital Partners was the Harvard representative on the Harken Energy board when Harvard made a $30 million investment into the ill-fated oil company venture.[19] At the time, employees were accused of improperly investing their own money into Harken but Harvard deemed those investments appropriate.[20]\n\n\n\n### Investments in Romania[edit]\n\n\nFrom 2004 to 2015 Harvard University acquired 33,600 hectares (83,000 acres) of Romanian forest land. In 2015 they abruptly sold their entire holding to a subsidiary of Ikea. These holdings have since faced significant legal challenge as many were acquired corruptly during Romania's post-Communist restitution process.[21]\n\n\n\n### Ending investments in fossil fuels[edit]\n\n\nIn September 2021, after years of pressure from student and outside groups, Harvard announced that it will stop investments in fossil fuels.[22] The university's public announcement cited \"the need to decarbonize the economy and our responsibility as fiduciaries\" in explaining its decision.[23] Climate activists on campus had waged a multi-year campaign for full divestment, including bringing lawsuits, storming the field of the 2019 Harvard-Yale football game, organizing on-campus protests, and other strategies.[24]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of colleges and universities in the United States by endowment\n* List of wealthiest charitable foundations\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Virginia L.

In 1718, Elihu Yale sold a portion of his collection of gems and furniture to provide an initial fund of £562 for the establishment of the school's endowment.[5] From 1985 until 2021, the Chief Investment Officer of Yale was alumnus David Swensen, who was replaced by alumnus Matthew Mendelsohn.[2][3] As of 2013, the chairman of the Yale Investment Committee, which provides oversight of the endowment, was Douglas A. Warner III.[6]\n\n\n\n## Investments and performance[edit]\n\n\nAs of June 30, 2021, the endowment was valued at $42.3 billion.[1] Since the early 1990s, the endowment has generated annual returns for the university of approximately 11.3 percent, with a portion of the annual return forming part of the university's operating budget and the remainder reinvested to grow the size of the endowment.[7] Spending from revenue earned off the endowment accounted for $1.2 billion of the university's operating budget in 2017 and $1.5 billion in 2021.[7][1] The university aims to spend approximately 5.25 percent of the endowment on its annual operating budget.[1]\n\n\nThe endowment has become known for seeking out \"unconventional assets\" and for investments in emerging businesses.[8] In the 1990s it invested in Google and Amazon and was later an early investor in Facebook, LinkedIn, and Airbnb.[8] As of 2016, its venture capital investments had averaged 93-percent returns over the preceding two decades.[9]\n\n\n\n## Issues[edit]\n\n\nIn 2016 the State of Connecticut considered taxing Yale's investment returns as a way of plugging a gap in the state budget.[10] The university objected, in part, on the grounds that such a move would be a violation of the tax exemption guaranteed to the university by the Colony of Connecticut in 1745.[10][11]\n\n\nBeginning in the early 2000s, some criticized the size of compensation given to the endowment's managers.[12] In 2015, Swenson earned $4.5 million, making him the highest-paid employee at the university, surpassing the compensation of even university president Peter Salovey.[12][13] Others have said the salaries of endowment managers are justifiable, asserting that they are less than what could be earned in the private sector and pay for themselves with the endowment's high rates of return.[12]\n\n\nYale's endowment has been widely criticized for its investments in fossil fuel companies, Puerto Rican debt, private prisons, companies which provide services to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, subprime mortgage lending companies, and for other controversial holdings. In December 2018, after years of criticism from campus fossil fuel divestment groups, Yale University arrested 48 student activists for staging a sit-in at the Yale Investment Office to protest Yale’s holdings in the fossil fuel industry and Puerto Rican debt.[14] That same quarter Yale sold 99 percent of its direct investment holdings in Antero Resource Corporation, a natural gas and oil company, according to Yale’s 2018 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.[15]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of colleges and universities in the United States by endowment\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** \"Yale endowment earns 40.2% investment return in fiscal 2021\". *YaleNews*. 2021-10-14.

On April 11, 2007, Columbia University announced a $400 million donation from media billionaire alumnus John Kluge to be used exclusively for undergraduate financial aid. The donation is among the largest single gifts to higher education.[129] As of 2008[update], undergraduates from families with incomes as high as $60,000 a year will have the projected cost of attending the university, including room, board, and academic fees, fully paid for by the university. That same year, the university ended loans for incoming and then-current students who were on financial aid, replacing loans that were traditionally part of aid packages with grants from the university. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n193. **^** \"Edwin Howard Armstrong Memorial Award.

Its official corporate name is \"The Trustees of Columbia University in the City of New York\". The university's first charter was granted in 1754 by King George II; however, its modern charter was first enacted in 1787 and last amended in 1810 by the New York State Legislature. The university is governed by 24 trustees, customarily including the president, who serves *ex officio*. The trustees themselves are responsible for choosing their successors. Six of the 24 are nominated from a pool of candidates recommended by the Columbia Alumni Association.

It is one of nine colonial colleges and was chartered prior to the U.S. Declaration of Independence when Benjamin Franklin, the university's founder and first president, advocated for an educational institution that trained leaders in academia, commerce, and public service. Penn identifies as the fourth oldest institution of higher education in the United States, though this representation is challenged by other universities, as Franklin first convened the Board of Trustees in 1749, arguably making it the fifth oldest institution of higher education in the U.S.[note 2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n151. **^** \"Penn to Build New College House Near 40th and Walnut Streets: University of Pennsylvania\".

Sometime later in its early history, Penn began naming 1749 as its founding date, which it continued to reference as the founding date for over a century, including at a centennial celebration in 1849.[49] In 1899, the board of trustees voted to adjust the founding date earlier again, this time to 1740, the date of \"the creation of the earliest of the many educational trusts the University has taken upon itself\", according to a book on the university's history.[50] The board of trustees voted in response to a three-year campaign by Penn's General Alumni Society to retroactively revise the university's founding date to 1740 for a number of reasons, including to appear older than Princeton University, which had been chartered in 1746.[51]\n\n\n\n### First university[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n13. **^** Permissible in situations where it may help to distinguish Penn from other universities within the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and used as part of email address, accessed June 9, 2021\n14. **^** \"Penn Research: By the Numbers\", University of Pennsylvania website\n15. **^** \"These are the 10 oldest stadiums in Division I college football\", NCAA, July 26, 2022\n16. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Nobel Prize Awarded to Covid Vaccine Pioneers https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/02/health/nobel-prize-medicine.html?smid=nytcore-android-share accessed October 2, 2023\n17. **^** \"Congratulations to Claudia Goldin, who was awarded the 2023 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences today\".

In spring of 2022 (Class of 2026), Cornell's undergraduate programs received 71,164 applications and admitted only 5,168 for a 7.2% acceptance rate.[116] For Fall 2019 enrolling freshmen, the middle 50% range of SAT scores were 680–760 for evidence-based reading and writing and 720–800 for mathematics.[117] The middle 50% range of the ACT composite score was 32–35.[117]\n\n\nThe university continues to attract a diverse and inclusive student body. The proportion of admitted students who self-identify as underrepresented minorities increased to 34.2% from 33.7% in 2021, and 59.3% self-identify as students of color. That number has increased steadily over the past five years, enrollment officials said, from 52.5% in 2017 and 57.2% in 2020.\n\n\nOf those admitted, 1,163 will be first-generation college students, another increase over 2020's 844.[118] The university is need-blind for domestic applicants.[119]\n\n\n\n### Financial aid[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCornell has a rich history of scientific, technological, and engineering research accomplishments. The university has made significant contributions to the fields of nuclear physics, high-energy physics, space exploration, automotive safety, and computing technology, among others. Cornell consistently ranks among the top U.S. universities for patent acquisition and start-up company formation.[176] In the 2004–05 academic year, the university filed 203 U.S. patent applications, completed 77 commercial license agreements, and distributed royalties of more than $4.1 million to Cornell units and inventors.[13] In 2009 Cornell spent $671 million on science and engineering research and development, the 16th highest in the United States.[177]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n125. **^** Skorton, David (25 January 2009). \"Trustees approve budget cuts to safeguard strength of Cornell\" (Press release).

Established in 1769 by Eleazar Wheelock, it is one of the nine colonial colleges chartered before the American Revolution. Although originally established to educate Native Americans in Christian theology and the English way of life, the university primarily trained Congregationalist ministers during its early history before it gradually secularized. Emerging into national prominence at the turn of the 20th century, Dartmouth was considered to be the most prestigious undergraduate college in the United States in the early 1900s.[8][9] While Dartmouth is now a research university rather than simply an undergraduate college, it continues to go by \"Dartmouth College\" to emphasize its focus on undergraduate education.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDartmouth emerged onto the national academic stage at the turn of the 20th century. Prior to this period, the college had clung to traditional methods of instruction and was relatively poorly funded.[30] Under President William Jewett Tucker (1893–1909), Dartmouth underwent a major revitalization of facilities, faculty, and the student body, following large endowments such as the $10,000 given by Dartmouth alumnus and law professor John Ordronaux.[31] 20 new structures replaced antiquated buildings, while the student body and faculty both expanded threefold. Tucker is often credited for having \"refounded Dartmouth\" and bringing it into national prestige.[32] \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n192. **^** \"What is the Ivy League?\". Ivy League Sports.

Dartmouth is one of seven American universities to practice international need-blind admissions.[92] This means that all applicants, including U.S. permanent residents, undocumented students in the U.S., and international students, are admitted to the college without regard to their financial circumstances. At Dartmouth, free tuition is provided for students from families with total incomes of $125,000 or less and possessing typical assets.[93] Dartmouth is also one of a few U.S. universities to eliminate undergraduate student loans and replace them with expanded scholarship grants.[94] In 2015, $88.8 million (~$112 million in 2023) in need-based scholarships were awarded to Dartmouth students.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSituated on a terrace above the Connecticut River, Dartmouth's 269-acre (109 ha) main campus is in the rural Upper Valley region of New England.[13] The university functions on a quarter system, operating year-round on four ten-week academic terms.[14] Dartmouth is known for its undergraduate focus, Greek culture, and campus traditions.[15][16] Its 34 varsity sports teams compete intercollegiately in the Ivy League conference of the NCAA Division I. The university has many prominent alumni, including 170 members of the United States Congress,[17] 24 U.S. governors, 23 billionaires,[a] 8 U.S. Cabinet secretaries, 3 Nobel Prize laureates, 2 U.S. Supreme Court justices, and a U.S. vice president.

In 2005, sponsored project awards to Dartmouth faculty research amounted to $169 million.[62]\n\n\nDartmouth served as the host member of the University Press of New England, a university press founded in 1970 that included Brandeis University, Tufts University, the University of New Hampshire, and Northeastern University. The University Press of New England shut down in 2018.[63][64] With the exception of Dartmouth College Press titles, in 2021, Brandeis become the sole owner of all copyrights and titles of UPNE.[65]\n\n\n\n### Rankings[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n44. **^** Schpero, William (September 19, 2007). \"Battle for Board leaves boardroom\". *The Dartmouth*.

On April 11, 2007, Columbia University announced a $400 million donation from media billionaire alumnus John Kluge to be used exclusively for undergraduate financial aid. The donation is among the largest single gifts to higher education.[129] As of 2008[update], undergraduates from families with incomes as high as $60,000 a year will have the projected cost of attending the university, including room, board, and academic fees, fully paid for by the university. That same year, the university ended loans for incoming and then-current students who were on financial aid, replacing loans that were traditionally part of aid packages with grants from the university. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nColumbia is organized into twenty schools, including four undergraduate schools and 16 graduate schools. The university's research efforts include the Lamont–Doherty Earth Observatory, the Goddard Institute for Space Studies, and accelerator laboratories with Big Tech firms such as Amazon and IBM.[10][11] Columbia is a founding member of the Association of American Universities and was the first school in the United States to grant the MD degree.[12] The university also annually administers the Pulitzer Prize. Its endowment stands at $13.3 billion as of 2022[update], which is among the largest of any academic institution.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nColumbia University| ![](image)Coat of arms\n |\n| Latin: *Universitas Columbiae* |\n| Former names\n | King's College(1754–1784)Columbia College(1784–1896)[1]: 53–60 |\n| Motto | *In lumine Tuo videbimus lumen* (Latin) |\n| Motto in English\n | \"In Thy light shall we see light\"[2] |\n| Type | Private research university |\n| Established | May 25, 1754; 270 years ago (1754-05-25) |\n| Accreditation | MSCHE |\n| Academic affiliations\n | * AAU\n* NAICU\n* URA\n* Space-grant\n |\n| Endowment | $13.3 billion (2022)[3] |\n| President | Minouche Shafik |\n| Provost | Dennis Mitchell |\n| Academic staff\n | 4,370[4] |\n| Students | 34,782 (Fall 2022)[5] |\n| Undergraduates | 6,668 (Fall 2022)[n 1][5] |\n| Postgraduates | 25,880 (Fall 2022)[5] |\n| Location | New York\n, New York\n, United States\n40°48′27″N 73°57′43″W﻿ / ﻿40.80750°N 73.96194°W﻿ / 40.80750; -73.96194 |\n| Campus | Large city, 299 acres (1.21 km2) |\n| Newspaper | *Columbia Daily Spectator* |\n| Colors | Columbia blue and white[8]    |\n| Nickname | Lions |\n| Sporting affiliations\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Undergraduate admissions statistics |\n| --- |\n| 2021 enteringclass[123]Change vs.2016[124]\n\n\n---\n\n |\n| Admit rate | 3.9% (![Neutral decrease](image) −2.1)\n |\n| Yield rate | 66.5% (![Increase](image) +1.4)\n |\n| Test scores middle 50% |\n| SAT Total | 1510–1560 (![Decrease](image) −10 median)\n |\n|  |\n\n\nColumbia University received 60,551 applications for the class of 2025 (entering 2021) and a total of around 2,218 were admitted to the two schools for an overall acceptance rate of 3.66%.[125] Columbia is a racially diverse school, with approximately 52% of all students identifying themselves as persons of color.

The university is governed by 24 trustees, customarily including the president, who serves *ex officio*. The trustees themselves are responsible for choosing their successors. Six of the 24 are nominated from a pool of candidates recommended by the Columbia Alumni Association. Another six are nominated by the board in consultation with the executive committee of the University Senate. The remaining 12, including the president, are nominated by the trustees themselves through their internal processes. The term of office for trustees is six years.

Cornell University: 1 confirmed Nobel laureate\n- David Lee (Physics, 1996)\n\n4.

The data shown might not include all historical affiliations\n2. Some laureates might have multiple affiliations\n3. Some more recent winners might not be included\n4. Different universities may count affiliations differently (some count visiting professors, some only count full-time faculty, etc.)\n\nTo get more accurate numbers, I would recommend:\n1.
