He previously led the company's Sam's Club division, from 2005 to 2009, and Walmart International, from 2009 to 2013.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nMcMillon was born in Memphis, Tennessee,[2] and grew up in Jonesboro, Arkansas,[3] the eldest of three children born to Laura and Morris McMillon, a dentist who served in Vietnam.[4] His parents moved the family to Bentonville, Arkansas, the home of Walmart headquarters, when McMillon was 16.[4] A sports enthusiast, McMillon played point guard on the Bentonville High School basketball team.[4]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring McMillon's tenure, Walmart International's sales growth outpaced Walmart US[14] and grew to 29 percent of total sales company-wide.[9] When McMillon first became head of the division, it comprised more than 3,300 stores in 14 countries.[15] When Walmart announced it would move him to head Walmart Stores, Inc. in late 2013, Walmart International operated 6,300 stores in 26 countries.[16][*failed verification*]\n\n\n\n### CEO of Walmart, Inc.

While increased spending on labor and Walmart's digital offerings lowered short-term profits, McMillon argued that the moves would lead to happier workers and better customer service,[18] as well as a better footing in a changing retail market.[19]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n7. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Microsoft names former Sam's Club exec as new COO\".

The \"pinnacle of Saudization\" occurred when the Shaybah oil field came on line in July 1998, after a three-year effort by a team consisting of 90% Saudis. The Aramco of 2016 still maintained an expatriate workforce of about 15%, so Aramco can, in the words of Al-Naimi, \"be sure it is getting access to the latest innovations and technical expertise.\"[27]\n\n\nSaudi Aramco has emitted 59.26 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent since it began operations, accounting for 4.38% of worldwide anthropogenic CO2 emissions since 1965.[115]\n\n\nIn a letter sent to nine international banks reportedly hired by Aramco to assist it in arranging its US$2 trillion market debut, ten environmental groups warned about the listing causing a highly possible hindrance in the effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and end human rights abuses committed by the Saudi regime.[116]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 1970, Aramco started hiring its first high school graduates, and in 1979 started offering college scholarships. In 1965, Zafer H. Husseini was named the first Saudi manager and in 1974, Faisal Al-Bassam was named the first Saudi vice president. One of the early students was Al-Naimi, who was named the first Saudi president of Aramco in November 1983. As Al-Naimi states, \"The oil company committed itself to developing qualified Saudis to become fully educated and trained industry professionals.\" Al-Naimi acknowledged Thomas Barger's championing of Saudization, \"You, of all of Aramco's leaders, had the greatest vision when you supported the training effort of Saudi Arab employees during its early days. That visionary support and effort is bearing fruit now and many executive positions are filled by Saudis because of that effort.\" In 1943, 1,600 Saudis were employed at Aramco, but by 1987, nearly two-thirds of Aramco's 43,500 strong workforce were Saudis. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n77. **^** \"Saudi Aramco's profits slide nearly 45% after lower oil demand\". *BBC News*. 21 March 2021.

It has repeatedly achieved the largest annual profits in global corporate history. Saudi Aramco has both the world's second-largest proven crude oil reserves, at more than 270 billion barrels (43\u00a0billion cubic metres),[9] and largest daily oil production of all oil-producing companies.[10][11][12]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn June 2008, in response to crude oil prices exceeding US$130 a barrel, Aramco announced it would increase production to 9.7 million barrels per day (mbpd). Then as prices plummeted, Aramco stated in January 2009, that it would reduce production to 7.7 mbpd.[27]:\u200a265\u2013267\n\n\nIn 2011, Saudi Aramco started production from the Karan Gas Field, with an output of more than 400 million scf per day.[31]\n\n\nIn January 2016, the Deputy Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammad bin Salman Al Saud, announced he was considering listing shares of the state-owned company, and selling around 5% of them in order to build a large sovereign wealth fund.[32]\n\n\nOn 26 April 2017, Saudi security forces thwarted an attempted attack on an Aramco oil distribution center involving an unmanned boat from Yemen.[33]\n\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported in September 2018, Aramco was considering a US$1 billion venture-capital fund to invest in international technology firms.[34]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn June 2019, a report by Financial Times claimed that Aramco had been bearing the ministry-related expenses; boosting the finance ministry budget allocation. It also included Energy Minister Khalid Al Falih\u2019s company-related and diplomatic trips, as well as his stays in luxurious hotels. However, an ally mentioned that Falih\u2019s policies have delivered additional oil revenues that far exceeded his expenses.[35]\n\n\nIn September 2019, Saudi Arabia appointed Yasir Al-Rumayyan as the Chairman of Aramco. Al-Rumayyan became head of the country\u2019s sovereign wealth fund by replacing Khalid Al-Falih, who was holding the position since 2015.[36]\n\n\n\n### 2012 cyber attack[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n98. **^** \"Aramco to buy Shell's stake in Saudi refining JV for $631 million\". *Reuters*. 21 April 2019.

In 1965, Zafer H. Husseini was named the first Saudi manager and in 1974, Faisal Al-Bassam was named the first Saudi vice president. One of the early students was Al-Naimi, who was named the first Saudi president of Aramco in November 1983. As Al-Naimi states, \"The oil company committed itself to developing qualified Saudis to become fully educated and trained industry professionals.\" Al-Naimi acknowledged Thomas Barger's championing of Saudization, \"You, of all of Aramco's leaders, had the greatest vision when you supported the training effort of Saudi Arab employees during its early days. That visionary support and effort is bearing fruit now and many executive positions are filled by Saudis because of that effort.\" In 1943, 1,600 Saudis were employed at Aramco, but by 1987, nearly two-thirds of Aramco's 43,500 strong workforce were Saudis. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 1988, Al-Naimi became CEO and Hisham Nazer became chairman, the first Saudis to hold those positions. The \"pinnacle of Saudization\" occurred when the Shaybah oil field came on line in July 1998, after a three-year effort by a team consisting of 90% Saudis. The Aramco of 2016 still maintained an expatriate workforce of about 15%, so Aramco can, in the words of Al-Naimi, \"be sure it is getting access to the latest innovations and technical expertise.\"[27]\n\n\nSaudi Aramco has emitted 59.26 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent since it began operations, accounting for 4.38% of worldwide anthropogenic CO2 emissions since 1965.[115]\n\n\nIn a letter sent to nine international banks reportedly hired by Aramco to assist it in arranging its US$2 trillion market debut, ten environmental groups warned about the listing causing a highly possible hindrance in the effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and end human rights abuses committed by the Saudi regime.[116]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSaudi Arabian Oil Group| ![](image) |\n| ![](image)Headquarters in Dhahran, Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia\n |\n| Trade name\n | Saudi Aramco |\n| Native name\n | \u0623\u0631\u0627\u0645\u0643\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0639\u0648\u062f\u064a\u0629 |\n| Company type | Public (mostly state-owned) |\n| Traded as\n | Tadawul:\u00a02222 |\n| ISIN | SA14TG012N13\u00a0![Edit this on Wikidata](image) |\n| Industry | Oil and gas |\n| Founded | 29 May 1933; 91 years ago\u00a0(29 May 1933) |\n| Headquarters | Dhahran, Saudi Arabia[1] |\n| Area served\n | Worldwide |\n| Key people\n | * Amin H.

Al-Naimi pointed out, \"From the beginning, the development of Aramco was directly tied to the betterment of Saudi Arabia.\" Another school was located in Dhahran in 1941, and was called the Jebel School. Boys hired into entry-level positions attended at 7\u00a0AM for four hours, followed by four hours of work in the afternoon. In 1950, Aramco built schools for 2,400 students. In 1959, Aramco sent the first group of Saudi students to college in the States. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Saudi Arabian Oil Company (Saudi Aramco)\". *Forbes*.

It has repeatedly achieved the largest annual profits in global corporate history. Saudi Aramco has both the world's second-largest proven crude oil reserves, at more than 270 billion barrels (43\u00a0billion cubic metres),[9] and largest daily oil production of all oil-producing companies.[10][11][12]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSaudi Arabian petroleum company\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1973, following US support for Israel during the Yom Kippur War, the Saudi Arabian government acquired a 25% \"participation interest\" in Aramco's assets.

Aramco continued to operate and manage the former Aramco assets, including its concessionary interest in certain Saudi Arab oil fields, on behalf of the Saudi Arab Government until 1988. In November 1988, a royal decree created a new Saudi Arab company, the Saudi Arabian Oil Company, to take control of the former Aramco assets (or Saudi Aramco)[28] and took the management and operations control of Saudi Arabia's oil and gas fields from Aramco and its partners.

It is the largest utility company in the world. As of 2022[update], State Grid is the world's third largest company overall by revenue, behind Walmart and Saudi Aramco.[5] In 2022 it was reported as having 871,145 employees, 1.1 billion customers and revenue equivalent to US$460 billion. It is overseen by the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council.\n\n\nAfter the electricity Plant-Grid Separation reform in early 2002, the assets of State Electric Power Corporation (\u56fd\u5bb6\u7535\u529b\u516c\u53f8) were divided into five power generation groups that retained the power plants and five regional subsidiaries belonging to the State Grid Corporation of China in Beijing.[6]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nChina began an initiative to reform the country's power sector in a three-stage process in 1986.[7] In the third and final stage in March 2002 the State Council of the People's Republic of China put into effect a plan to restructure the country's electric power system in order to create competition and separate generation and transmission functions.[8] The State Grid Corporation of China was founded on December 29, 2002, when the restructuring divided the former State Power Corporation of China into two grid companies, five generation groups and four accessorial business companies.[9] The two grid companies created were the State Grid Corporation of China and a smaller China Southern Power Grid Company.[10] SGCC accounts for 80% of the Chinese grid, with China Southern Power Grid accounting for the other 20%.[11]:\u200a40 At its creation, SGCC company had a generation capacity of 6.47 gigawatts.[8]\n\n\nIn 2003 and progressively so through the early 2000s, electrical shortages caused the government to institute rolling blackouts. The State Grid Corporation estimated there were 1 trillion yuan in losses from 2002 to 2005.[8] The State Grid Corporation of China ran the first 1,000-kilovolt alternating current power line between Northern Shanxi and center Hubei in January 2009. In 2012 it began operation of an 800-kilovolt direct current line that sends hydropower from western Sichuan to Shanghai. It also has an alternating current loop line in the Yangtze River delta, and three longitudinal alternating current lines that bring power to Southern China from the Northern region.[12]\n\n\nThe State Grid Corporation was involved in a multi-phase smart-grid project for China's electrical grid planned for 2011\u20132015.[13] China's smart grid efforts are different from those in the United States in that its plans heavily use ultra high voltage (UHV) lines. Several UHV construction projects began in 2012 to bring UHV power lines across Huainan, Wannan, and Shanghai and another from Xilingol League to Nanjing. By 2015, the company planned to have three more horizontal UHV lines through West Inner Mongolia to Weifang, from Central Shanxi\u2013Xuzhou to Yaan\u2013southern Anhui and 11 other lines by 2015.[12]\n\n\nIn 2012 the company invested in CDP Reti.\n\n\nFrom 2010 to 2020 the companies investments in grid expansion rose from 291.12 BioYuan to 460.5 BioYuan.[14]\n\n\n\n## Controversy[edit]\n\n\nOn October 29, 2014, The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection declared that the general manager of State Grid Shanghai Municipal Electric Power, Feng Jun, was detained in an anti-graft operation overseen by the commission.[15] In 2017, his assets (worth 53 million yuan) were seized, and he was sentenced to life in prison.[16]\n\n\n\n## Overseas investments[edit]\n\n\n### Philippines[edit]\n\n\nOn December 12, 2007, two consortia bid for a 25-year license to run the Philippines power grid\u2014privatization of the management of the Philippine government-owned National Transmission Corporation (TransCo), the consortium of Monte Oro Grid Resources Corp., led by businessman Enrique Razon, comprising the State Grid Corporation of China, and Calaca High Power Corp., won an auction conducted by the Power Sector Assets and Liabilities Management (PSALM) Corp. as it submitted the highest offer of $3.95 billion, for the right to operate TransCo for 25 years, outbidding San Miguel Energy, a unit of the Filipino San Miguel Corporation (bid of $3.905 billion), Dutch firm TPG Aurora BV, and Malaysia's TNB Prai Sdn Bhd.[17][18][19] This initiated the privatization process for the transmission sector. The resulting consortium became the National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP).[20]\n\n\nOn February 21, 2008, NGCP was registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\n\nOn February 28, 2008, TransCo's concession agreement with NGCP was executed and became effective. The agreement between NGCP and TransCo was signed by TransCo president Arthur Aguilar, PSALM president Jose Ibazeta, and NGCP directors Walter Brown, Elmer Pedregosa and Du Zhigang.[21][22] In November of that same year, Congress approved bicameral resolution granting franchise to NGCP to manage and operate its transmission facilities nationwide. President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo signed Republic Act 9511 which granted NGCP to operate and manage the country's power grid in December 2008.\n\n\nOn January 15, 2009, TransCo turned over the operations, maintenance, and management of the transmission system to NGCP which marked the start of the 25-year concession period and franchise and renewable for another 25 years with a total of 50 years, which privatized the operations and maintenance of the Philippine power grid and its related assets and facilities and turned over from the Philippine government to the private sector. The franchise and concession period will end on December 1, 2058.[23][24][25]\n\n\n\n### Other countries[edit]\n\n\nIn Portugal, State Grid has a 25% stake in REN since the second stage of its privatization (in 2012\u20132014).[26]\n\n\nIn Australia, State Grid owns a 41% stake in ElectraNet, a 19.9% stake in AusNet Services, and 60% stake in Jemena.[27]\n\n\nIn Brazil, State Grid is involved in developing, building, and operating hydropower facilities.[11]:\u200a207 State Grid acquired the control of CPFL Energia S.A. for the equivalent of US$3.4 billion in 2017.[28] State Grid built the 2000\u00a0km Ultra High Voltage power line delivering hydropower to the megacities Rio de Janeiro and S\u00e3o Paulo.[29]\n\n\nIn Chile, State Grid acquired Chilquinta Energ\u00eda, the third-largest distributor of electricity in Chile, and Tecnored SA, which provides construction services to Chilquinta, from U.S. power company Sempra Energy. The deal was closed on June 24, 2020.[30] On 13 November 2020, it was announced that State Grid had reached an agreement to acquire Compa\u00f1ia General de Electricidad (CGE), the largest distribution of electricity in this country.[31]\n\n\n\n## Subsidiaries[edit]\n\n\n* State Grid Yingda Group\n\t+ Yingda International Trust (89.76%)\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Energy portal\n* ![](image)Companies portal\n\n\n* China Southern Power Grid\n* China Datang Corporation\n* List of companies of China\n* Smart grid\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"State Grid's 2017 financial report\".

It is the largest utility company in the world. As of 2022[update], State Grid is the world's third largest company overall by revenue, behind Walmart and Saudi Aramco.[5] In 2022 it was reported as having 871,145 employees, 1.1 billion customers and revenue equivalent to US$460 billion. It is overseen by the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council.\n\n\nAfter the electricity Plant-Grid Separation reform in early 2002, the assets of State Electric Power Corporation (\u56fd\u5bb6\u7535\u529b\u516c\u53f8) were divided into five power generation groups that retained the power plants and five regional subsidiaries belonging to the State Grid Corporation of China in Beijing.[6]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nChina began an initiative to reform the country's power sector in a three-stage process in 1986.[7] In the third and final stage in March 2002 the State Council of the People's Republic of China put into effect a plan to restructure the country's electric power system in order to create competition and separate generation and transmission functions.[8] The State Grid Corporation of China was founded on December 29, 2002, when the restructuring divided the former State Power Corporation of China into two grid companies, five generation groups and four accessorial business companies.[9] The two grid companies created were the State Grid Corporation of China and a smaller China Southern Power Grid Company.[10] SGCC accounts for 80% of the Chinese grid, with China Southern Power Grid accounting for the other 20%.[11]:\u200a40 At its creation, SGCC company had a generation capacity of 6.47 gigawatts.[8]\n\n\nIn 2003 and progressively so through the early 2000s, electrical shortages caused the government to institute rolling blackouts. The State Grid Corporation estimated there were 1 trillion yuan in losses from 2002 to 2005.[8] The State Grid Corporation of China ran the first 1,000-kilovolt alternating current power line between Northern Shanxi and center Hubei in January 2009. In 2012 it began operation of an 800-kilovolt direct current line that sends hydropower from western Sichuan to Shanghai. It also has an alternating current loop line in the Yangtze River delta, and three longitudinal alternating current lines that bring power to Southern China from the Northern region.[12]\n\n\nThe State Grid Corporation was involved in a multi-phase smart-grid project for China's electrical grid planned for 2011\u20132015.[13] China's smart grid efforts are different from those in the United States in that its plans heavily use ultra high voltage (UHV) lines. Several UHV construction projects began in 2012 to bring UHV power lines across Huainan, Wannan, and Shanghai and another from Xilingol League to Nanjing. By 2015, the company planned to have three more horizontal UHV lines through West Inner Mongolia to Weifang, from Central Shanxi\u2013Xuzhou to Yaan\u2013southern Anhui and 11 other lines by 2015.[12]\n\n\nIn 2012 the company invested in CDP Reti.\n\n\nFrom 2010 to 2020 the companies investments in grid expansion rose from 291.12 BioYuan to 460.5 BioYuan.[14]\n\n\n\n## Controversy[edit]\n\n\nOn October 29, 2014, The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection declared that the general manager of State Grid Shanghai Municipal Electric Power, Feng Jun, was detained in an anti-graft operation overseen by the commission.[15] In 2017, his assets (worth 53 million yuan) were seized, and he was sentenced to life in prison.[16]\n\n\n\n## Overseas investments[edit]\n\n\n### Philippines[edit]\n\n\nOn December 12, 2007, two consortia bid for a 25-year license to run the Philippines power grid\u2014privatization of the management of the Philippine government-owned National Transmission Corporation (TransCo), the consortium of Monte Oro Grid Resources Corp., led by businessman Enrique Razon, comprising the State Grid Corporation of China, and Calaca High Power Corp., won an auction conducted by the Power Sector Assets and Liabilities Management (PSALM) Corp. as it submitted the highest offer of $3.95 billion, for the right to operate TransCo for 25 years, outbidding San Miguel Energy, a unit of the Filipino San Miguel Corporation (bid of $3.905 billion), Dutch firm TPG Aurora BV, and Malaysia's TNB Prai Sdn Bhd.[17][18][19] This initiated the privatization process for the transmission sector. The resulting consortium became the National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP).[20]\n\n\nOn February 21, 2008, NGCP was registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\n\nOn February 28, 2008, TransCo's concession agreement with NGCP was executed and became effective. The agreement between NGCP and TransCo was signed by TransCo president Arthur Aguilar, PSALM president Jose Ibazeta, and NGCP directors Walter Brown, Elmer Pedregosa and Du Zhigang.[21][22] In November of that same year, Congress approved bicameral resolution granting franchise to NGCP to manage and operate its transmission facilities nationwide. President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo signed Republic Act 9511 which granted NGCP to operate and manage the country's power grid in December 2008.\n\n\nOn January 15, 2009, TransCo turned over the operations, maintenance, and management of the transmission system to NGCP which marked the start of the 25-year concession period and franchise and renewable for another 25 years with a total of 50 years, which privatized the operations and maintenance of the Philippine power grid and its related assets and facilities and turned over from the Philippine government to the private sector. The franchise and concession period will end on December 1, 2058.[23][24][25]\n\n\n\n### Other countries[edit]\n\n\nIn Portugal, State Grid has a 25% stake in REN since the second stage of its privatization (in 2012\u20132014).[26]\n\n\nIn Australia, State Grid owns a 41% stake in ElectraNet, a 19.9% stake in AusNet Services, and 60% stake in Jemena.[27]\n\n\nIn Brazil, State Grid is involved in developing, building, and operating hydropower facilities.[11]:\u200a207 State Grid acquired the control of CPFL Energia S.A. for the equivalent of US$3.4 billion in 2017.[28] State Grid built the 2000\u00a0km Ultra High Voltage power line delivering hydropower to the megacities Rio de Janeiro and S\u00e3o Paulo.[29]\n\n\nIn Chile, State Grid acquired Chilquinta Energ\u00eda, the third-largest distributor of electricity in Chile, and Tecnored SA, which provides construction services to Chilquinta, from U.S. power company Sempra Energy. The deal was closed on June 24, 2020.[30] On 13 November 2020, it was announced that State Grid had reached an agreement to acquire Compa\u00f1ia General de Electricidad (CGE), the largest distribution of electricity in this country.[31]\n\n\n\n## Subsidiaries[edit]\n\n\n* State Grid Yingda Group\n\t+ Yingda International Trust (89.76%)\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Energy portal\n* ![](image)Companies portal\n\n\n* China Southern Power Grid\n* China Datang Corporation\n* List of companies of China\n* Smart grid\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"State Grid's 2017 financial report\".

Jassy** (born January 13, 1968)[5][6] is an American business executive who is the president and chief executive officer (CEO) of Amazon. Before being appointed by Jeff Bezos and the Amazon board during the fourth quarter of 2020,[7][8] Jassy served as the SVP and later as the CEO of Amazon Web Services from 2003 to 2021.[9]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nJassy is the son of Margery and Everett L. Jassy of Scarsdale, New York.[3] Jewish[10][11] with Hungarian ancestry,[10] his father was a senior partner in the corporate law firm Dewey Ballantine in New York City, and chairman of the firm's management committee.[3] Jassy grew up in Scarsdale, and attended Scarsdale High School,[3][12] where he played varsity soccer and tennis.[13]\n\n\nJassy graduated cum laude from Harvard College in government, where he was advertising manager of *The Harvard Crimson*, before earning an MBA from Harvard Business School. In 1989, he wrote in *The Crimson* that the newspaper should continue to publish advertisements from Eastern Air Lines, despite an ongoing labor dispute there.[14][15][16]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nJassy worked for five years after graduation before entering his MBA program as a project manager for a collectibles company, MBI, and then he and an MBI colleague started a company and closed it down.[15][17]\n\n\nJassy joined Amazon as a marketing manager in 1997[13] with several other Harvard MBA colleagues.[17][15] In 2003, he and Jeff Bezos came up with the idea to create the cloud computing platform that became known as Amazon Web Services, which launched in 2006.[18] Jassy headed it and its team of 57 people.[1]\n\n\n\n![](image)Jassy in 2016\nIn 2016, Jassy was named Person of the Year by the *Financial Times*.[15] A month later, Jassy was promoted from senior vice president to chief executive officer of Amazon Web Services.[19][16] That year Jassy earned $36.6 million.[20]\n\n\nFor his work as chief executive officer of Amazon Web Services, Jassy earned a base compensation of $175,000 in 2020, plus a restricted stock unit award of 4,023 shares (a value of $12,104,844.93 as of July 26, 2020[21]) of Amazon with vesting beginning in 2023. He also received a restricted stock unit award in April 2018 for 10,000 shares (a value of $30,089,100 as of July 26, 2020),[21] which vest 37.5% in 2021, 12.5% in 2022, 37.5% in 2023, and 12.5% in 2024.[22]\n\n\nIn January 2021, Bezos designated Jassy his official successor as CEO;[23] with the transition occurring on July 5, 2021.[24] As CEO of Amazon, Jassy received a ten year pay package totaling $212.7 million. The majority of the compensation package is in stock and vests over 10 years.[25]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nIn 1997, Jassy married Elana Rochelle Caplan, a fashion designer for Eddie Bauer and graduate of the Philadelphia College of Textiles and Science, at a Loews Hotel in Santa Monica, California.[3] Their wedding was officiated by New York Rabbi James Brandt, a cousin of Elana.[26] Both their fathers were senior partners in law firm Dewey Ballantine.[3] Jassy and Caplan have two children.[4]\n\n\nThey live in the Capitol Hill neighborhood of Seattle in a 10,000-square-foot house bought in 2009 for $3.1 million.[2][27] In October 2020, it was reported that Jassy had bought a $6.7 million 5,500-square-foot house in Santa Monica.[28][29][27]\n\n\nHe is chairman of Rainier Prep, a charter school in Seattle.[30]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** McLaughlin, Kevin (August 4, 2015). \"Andy Jassy: Amazon's $6 Billion Man\".

Vitol has 40 offices worldwide and its largest operations are in Geneva, Houston, London, and Singapore.[8]\n\n\nWith revenues of $505 billion in 2022,[9] Vitol is the largest independent energy trader in the world, and would be the second-largest company worldwide as measured by revenue on the *Fortune* Global 500 list.[10] Given the secrecy Vitol maintains around all its business activities and the limited nature of its statutory disclosures,[11] it is excluded from rankings. The company, however, does provide some more financial information to its lenders and to a few other entities with which it trades.[12] The company ships more than 350 million tonnes of crude oil per year and controls 250 supertankers and other vessels to move it around the world. On average it handles more than 7.6 million barrels a day of oil and products, [9] roughly equivalent to the daily consumption of Japan, the world's fourth-largest oil consumer after the United States, China, and India.[13][14]\n\n\nVitol is a privately held company by about 400 partners who are current and former employees,[15] who are known for their intense culture of privacy and secrecy from both competitors and the general public.[16] It is reported that Vitol made a payout of $2.9 billion to all its partners in 2021[17][18]\n\n\n\n\n## Activities[edit]\n\n\n### Trading[edit]\n\n\nIn addition to the global crude and product trading businesses, the company trades coal, natural gas, power, ethanol, methanol, gasoline, LNG, LPG, naphtha, bitumen, base oils and carbon emissions.[19][20]\n\n\n\n### Terminals and infrastructure[edit]\n\n\nIn total, Vitol has around 16 million cubic meters of storage capacity across the globe.[21]\n\n\nVitol (45% stake), along with IFM Investors (45% stake) and Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (10% stake), own VTTI B.V., a storage and terminals business with a capacity of around 8.7 million cubic meters (MCM) in 11 countries: Netherlands (1.328 MCM + 1.118 MCM), Latvia (1.195 MCM), UAE (1.180 MCM), Belgium (0.965 MCM), Malaysia (0.893 MCM), Cyprus (0.544 MCM), USA (0.452 MCM), Argentina (0.218 MCM), Kenya (0.111 MCM), Russia (0.049 MCM), Nigeria (0.016 MCM).[22] MISC Berhad held a 50% stake in VTTI from May 2010 until August 2015.[23] In April 2022, Vitol announced its intention to stop trading Russian petrol by the end of 2022 due to International sanctions during the Russo-Ukrainian War.[24]\n\n\nIn January 2012, Vitol acquired a stake in a subsidiary of the South African shipping firm Grindrod, which gives it access to a coal terminal in Mozambique.[25]\n\n\n\n### Refining[edit]\n\n\nIn addition to offices in Dubai and Bahrain, Vitol's key strategic asset in the Middle East is the Fujairah Refinery Company Limited (FRCL), which operates an 82,000\u00a0barrel per day refinery and a 1,034,000\u00a0cubic meter tank farm. FRCL has further development plans in place, which include a 140,000 cubic meter expansion of the tank farm, refurbishment of existing refining units and the installation of additional processing units.[26] Vitol also has invested in refining assets in Bayernoil (Germany), Cressier (Switzerland), Antwerp (Belgium) and the Geelong refinery near Melbourne (Australia). In 2018, Vitol bought the 85,000 barrel per day Rotterdam Condensate Splitter from Koch Industries.\n\n\n\n### Exploration and production[edit]\n\n\nVitol, through its wholly owned subsidiaries Arawak Energy Limited and Vitol E&P, has interests in various exploration and production projects worldwide. Arawak Energy is mainly focused on the FSU where it produces oil and gas in Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan, while Vitol E&P holds a portfolio of exploration and development assets along the West African Transform Margin in Ghana and the Ivory Coast.\n\n\nIn February 2014, it was reported that Vitol, in concert with the Abu Dhabi Investment Council, had bought the downstream businesses of Shell Australia (excluding aviation) for a total of approximately AU$2.9 billion. The purchase included Shell's Geelong Refinery and its 870-site retail business, along with its bulk fuels, bitumen, chemicals and part of its lubricants businesses in Australia.[27] The business trades as Viva Energy, although the Shell brand remains on many of its retail products.[28]\n\n\nFurther, in January 2015, Vitol in collaboration with Eni signed a $7 billion agreement with the government, for the production of oil and gas at Cape Three Points in Western Region of Ghana. The contract is expected to help meet Ghana's burgeoning energy needs.[29]\n\n\n\n### Aviation[edit]\n\n\nVitol Aviation is focused on Europe, North America and Africa, serving the world\u2019s largest airlines and military customers with 5.7 million tonnes of jet fuel a year into wing.\n\n\n\n### Power[edit]\n\n\nIn 2013, Vitol invested in its first power plant, VPI Immingham in the UK. The combined heat and power plant (CHP) is one of the largest of its kind in Europe, capable of generating 1,240 MW and up to 930 tonnes of steam per hour which is used by nearby refineries. The gas-fired plant provides approximately 2.5% of UK peak electricity demand.\n\n\n\n### Renewable[edit]\n\n\nIn 2021, Vitol had 1.2 GW[9] of renewable power generation currently operational, planned & with further investments across the energy spectrum.\n\n\n\n## Figures[edit]\n\n\nIn 2018, Vitol traded:[20]\n\n\n\n* Oil: 367 million tonnes of crude oil and product sales\n* Natural Gas: over 20 billion cubic meters of physical gas globally\n* LPG: 14 million tonnes\n* Naphtha: 15 million tonnes\n* Gasoline: 1 million barrels of physical gasoline traded per day\n* Coal: over 30 million tonnes\n* Power: 93 TWh of power sales contracted\n* Carbon: 49\u00a0mm tonnes of contracted carbon volume\n* Methanol: 1.4 million tonnes\n* Chemicals: 4 million tonnes (Benzene and Paraxylene)\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\nA 2001 article in The Observer stated that in 1995 Vitol had secretly paid US$1 million to Serbian war criminal Arkan to settle a deal with a Serbian Oil company, Orion.[30][31] Vitol has denied all charges, arguing that no government agency has ever prosecuted the company in this respect.[32]\n\n\nIn 2007, Vitol pleaded guilty to grand larceny in a New York court for paying surcharges to Iraq's national oil company during Saddam's regime and circumventing the UN oil-for-food program. Vitol subsequently paid $17.5 million in restitution for its actions.[33]\n\n\nAccording to an article in the Financial Times, Vitol was the company to organise the first controversial sale of Libyan rebel oil to Tesoro Corporation in early April 2011.[34] According to the *Financial Times*, the company was approached by the Qatari national oil company to sell a cargo of crude oil supplied by the Libyans in exchange for technological supplies and fuel for the National Transitional Council of Libya.[35]\n\n\nIn September 2012, an article in *Reuters* alleged that the company had bought and sold Iranian fuel oil, bypassing an EU embargo against Tehran. Vitol bought 2 million barrels using a ship-to-ship transfer off the coast of Malaysia from a National Iranian Tanker Company vessel and sold it to Chinese traders. The article stated that as Vitol is based in Switzerland, which did not implement Western sanctions, Vitol had skirted the charges.[36]\n\n\nIn 2013, The Telegraph alleged that the company had been using, for over a decade, an Employee Benefit Trust, avoiding paying income tax for its UK staff.[37]\n\n\nIn 2018, The Dispute Settlement and Sanctions Committee of CRE, the French Energy Regulatory Commission, fined VITOL S.A. \u20ac5 million for engaging in market manipulation on the French Southern virtual Gas Trading Point (\u201cPEG Sud\u201d) between 1 June 2013 and 31 March 2014.[38] Vitol appealed this decision,[39] but the French Council of State confirmed the sanction in June 2021.[40]\n\n\nIn 2020, Vitol Inc. agreed to pay a combined total criminal penalty of $135 million to resolve bribery charges with law enforcement authorities in the United States and Brazil.[41][42][43] The resolution arises out of Vitol schemes to pay bribes to officials in Brazil, Ecuador and Mexico.[41]\n\n\n\n## Vitol Asia Pte Ltd[edit]\n\n\nVitol Asia Pte Ltd operates as an energy and commodities company, and offers refining, trading, shipping, and storage of crude oil and energy products.[44]\n\n\nThe company was founded in April 1990 and is headquartered in Singapore. The CEO of this subsidiary has been Mike Muller since 10 September 2019.[45]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** \"Meet The Mysterious Trading Firms Who Control The Price Of Commodities\". *BusinessNews*. 2011-10-31.
