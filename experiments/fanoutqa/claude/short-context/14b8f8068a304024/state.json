Andre Geim (Russia/Netherlands/United Kingdom)\n2. Konstantin Novoselov (Russia/United Kingdom)\n\nThey were awarded the prize \"for groundbreaking experiments regarding the two-dimensional material graphene.\" Their groundbreaking work involved discovering and isolating graphene, which is a single free-standing atomic layer of carbon, and studying its remarkable electronic properties.\n\nThe discovery was particularly notable because:\n1. It was the first time scientists had been able to isolate and study a single atomic layer of carbon (graphene).\n2. The material they discovered, graphene, showed remarkable properties that could potentially revolutionize various fields of technology.\n\nWhen Geim heard about winning the award, he responded modestly, saying \"I'm fine, I slept well. I didn't expect the Nobel Prize this year.\" He expressed hope that graphene and other two-dimensional crystals would change everyday life as plastics did for humanity, though he noted it might take a few decades to see the results.\n\nThe formal presentation of the Nobel lecture took place on December 8, 2010, at Stockholm University. This discovery was considered so significant that both scientists received numerous other honors, including knighthoods in the UK (Sir Andre Geim was knighted in the 2012 New Year Honours for services to science).",

This discovery was made through their detailed observations of distant supernovae. Their work led to the revolutionary discovery of dark energy and changed our understanding of the universe's evolution.\n\nThe discovery was made through two independent research teams:\n- Saul Perlmutter led the Supernova Cosmology Project\n- Brian Schmidt and Adam Riess were part of the High-Z Supernova Team\n\nThis discovery was so significant that it not only earned them the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics but also several other prestigious awards, including:\n- The 2006 Shaw Prize in Astronomy\n- The 2007 Gruber Cosmology Prize\n- The 2015 Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics\n\nThe monetary award for the Nobel Prize was 10 million Swedish kronor (approximately US$1.5 million at the time), with Perlmutter receiving one half and Riess and Schmidt sharing the other half.\n\nThis discovery fundamentally changed our understanding of the universe and introduced the concept of dark energy, which is now considered to be one of the greatest mysteries in modern physics and cosmology.",

Wineland (United States)\n\nThey were awarded the prize \"for ground-breaking experimental methods that enable measuring and manipulation of individual quantum systems.\"\n\nTheir specific contributions:\n- They developed innovative methods to measure and manipulate individual particles while preserving their quantum-mechanical nature.\n- Haroche's work primarily focused on atomic physics and quantum optics. He developed new methods for laser spectroscopy and worked with Rydberg atoms (giant atomic states particularly sensitive to microwaves). He demonstrated that these atoms, when coupled to a superconducting cavity containing a few photons, are well-suited for:\n  - Testing quantum decoherence\n  - Realizing quantum logic operations necessary for quantum information processing\n\nTheir groundbreaking work has helped in the study of the particle of light (the photon) and advanced our understanding of the quantum world. Their research has important implications for the development of quantum computers and super-precise atomic clocks.\n\nThis was a significant achievement in the field of quantum physics, as their methods allowed scientists to directly observe individual quantum particles without destroying them, which was previously thought impossible due to the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics.",

It's worth noting that Englert's co-researcher Robert Brout had died in 2011 and could not be awarded the prize as the Nobel Prize is not given posthumously.\n\nThe discovery of the Higgs boson was a major scientific breakthrough that validated theories about the origin of mass in subatomic particles that had been proposed nearly 50 years earlier. The particle was discovered by the ATLAS and CMS experiments at CERN's Large Hadron Collider.\n\nWould you like me to search for more specific information about any aspect of their Nobel Prize win or the Higgs boson discovery?",

Kamioka.\n\n- Arthur B. McDonald, working with the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory team, made similar discoveries about neutrino behavior.\n\nThe significance of their work:\n- Their discoveries solved the long-standing Solar neutrino problem, which was a major discrepancy between the predicted and measured Solar neutrino fluxes.\n- Their work proved that neutrinos have mass, which was contrary to the Standard Model of particle physics that had assumed neutrinos were massless.\n- This discovery indicated that the Standard Model of particle physics had weaknesses and needed to be revised.\n\nThe impact was so significant that Kajita, upon receiving the Nobel Prize, said at a news conference at the University of Tokyo, \"I want to thank the neutrinos, of course. And since neutrinos are created by cosmic rays, I want to thank them, too.\"\n\nThis breakthrough has been crucial for our understanding of the universe and the fundamental properties of subatomic particles.",

Andre Geim (Russia/Netherlands/United Kingdom)\n2. Konstantin Novoselov (Russia/United Kingdom)\n\nThey were awarded the prize \"for groundbreaking experiments regarding the two-dimensional material graphene.\" Their groundbreaking work involved discovering and isolating graphene, which is a single free-standing atomic layer of carbon, and studying its remarkable electronic properties.\n\nThe discovery was particularly notable because:\n1. It was the first time scientists had been able to isolate and study a single atomic layer of carbon (graphene).\n2. The material they discovered, graphene, showed remarkable properties that could potentially revolutionize various fields of technology.\n\nWhen Geim heard about winning the award, he responded modestly, saying \"I'm fine, I slept well. I didn't expect the Nobel Prize this year.\" He expressed hope that graphene and other two-dimensional crystals would change everyday life as plastics did for humanity, though he noted it might take a few decades to see the results.\n\nThe formal presentation of the Nobel lecture took place on December 8, 2010, at Stockholm University. This discovery was considered so significant that both scientists received numerous other honors, including knighthoods in the UK (Sir Andre Geim was knighted in the 2012 New Year Honours for services to science).",

Wineland for \"ground-breaking experimental methods that enable measuring and manipulation of individual quantum systems\", a study of the particle of light, the photon.[2][3][4] This and his other works developed laser spectroscopy. Since 2001, Haroche is a professor at the Coll\u00e8ge de France and holds the chair of quantum physics.\n\n\nIn 1971 he defended his doctoral thesis in physics at the University of Paris VI: his research had been conducted under the direction of Claude Cohen-Tannoudji.[5]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nHaroche was born in Casablanca, Morocco, to Albert Haroche (1920\u20131998), from a Moroccan Jewish family, and Valentine Haroche, born Roubleva (1921\u20131998), a teacher who was born in Odessa to a Jewish family of physicians who relocated to Morocco in the early 1920s. His father, a lawyer trained in Rabat, was one of seven children born to a family of teachers, Isaac and Esther Haroche, who worked at the *\u00c9cole de l\u2019Alliance isra\u00e9lite* (AIU).[6][7][8][9][10][11][12]\n\n\nBoth paternal grandparents of Serge Haroche had been AIU students in their respective hometowns of Marrakesh and T\u00e9touan (the school which Esther Azerad attended in T\u00e9touan had been founded in 1862; it was the first school of the AIU network).[13]\n\n\nHaroche left Morocco and settled in France in 1956, at the end of the French protectorate treaty.\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nHaroche worked in the Centre national de la recherche scientifique (CNRS) as a research scientist from 1967 to 1975, and spent a year (1972\u20131973) as a visiting post-doc in Stanford University, in Arthur Leonard Schawlow's team. In 1975 he moved to a professor position at Paris VI University. At the same time he taught in other institutions, in particular at the \u00c9cole polytechnique (1973\u20131984), MIT (1980)[1], Harvard University (1981), Yale University (1984\u20131993) and Conservatoire national des arts et m\u00e9tiers (2000). He was head of the Physics department at the \u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure from 1994 to 2000.\n\n\nSince 2001, Haroche has been a professor at the Coll\u00e8ge de France and holds the chair of quantum physics.\nHe is a member of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Fran\u00e7aise de Physique, the European Physical society and a fellow and member of the American Physical Society.\n\n\nIn September 2012, Serge Haroche was elected by his peers to the position of administrator of the Coll\u00e8ge de France.\n\n\nOn 9 October 2012 Haroche was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics, together with the American physicist David Wineland, for their work regarding measurement and manipulation of individual quantum systems.\n\n\nIn 2020, Haroche was appointed by European Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth Mariya Gabriel to serve on an independent search committee for the next president of the European Research Council (ERC), chaired by Helga Nowotny.[14]\n\n\n\n## Research[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Serge Haroche (who won Nobel Prize in Physics in 2012) visited Stockholm, June 2016, as a member of the Wallenberg Foundation Scientific Advisory Board.\nHaroche works primarily in atomic physics and quantum optics.[15][16][17][18][19][20][21] He is principally known for showing quantum decoherence by experimental observation, while working with colleagues at the \u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure in Paris in 1996.\n\n\nAfter a PhD dissertation on dressed atoms under the supervision of Claude Cohen-Tannoudji (himself a Nobel Prize recipient) from 1967 to 1971, he developed new methods for laser spectroscopy, based on the study of quantum beats and superradiance. He then moved on to Rydberg atoms, giant atomic states particularly sensitive to microwaves, which makes them well adapted for studying the interactions between light and matter. He showed that such atoms, coupled to a superconducting cavity containing a few photons, are well-suited to the testing of quantum decoherence and to the realization of quantum logic operations necessary for the treatment of quantum information.\n\n\n\n## Awards[edit]\n\n\nSerge Haroche after his Nobel Lecture\n* Commander of the French Legion of Honour\n* 1988 Einstein Prize for Laser Science (awarded at *Lasers* '88).\n* 1990 Fellow of the American Physical Society[22]\n* 1992 The Humboldt Prize\n* 1993 Albert A.

Serge Haroche (France)\n2. David J. Wineland (United States)\n\nThey were awarded the prize \"for ground-breaking experimental methods that enable measuring and manipulation of individual quantum systems.\"\n\nTheir specific contributions:\n- They developed innovative methods to measure and manipulate individual particles while preserving their quantum-mechanical nature.\n- Haroche's work primarily focused on atomic physics and quantum optics. He developed new methods for laser spectroscopy and worked with Rydberg atoms (giant atomic states particularly sensitive to microwaves). He demonstrated that these atoms, when coupled to a superconducting cavity containing a few photons, are well-suited for:\n  - Testing quantum decoherence\n  - Realizing quantum logic operations necessary for quantum information processing\n\nTheir groundbreaking work has helped in the study of the particle of light (the photon) and advanced our understanding of the quantum world. Their research has important implications for the development of quantum computers and super-precise atomic clocks.\n\nThis was a significant achievement in the field of quantum physics, as their methods allowed scientists to directly observe individual quantum particles without destroying them, which was previously thought impossible due to the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics.",

John Bardeen is the only laureate to win the prize twice\u2014in 1956 and 1972.\n\n\nWilliam Lawrence Bragg was the youngest Nobel laureate in physics; he won the prize in 1915 at the age of 25. He was also the youngest laureate for any Nobel prize until 2014 (when Malala Yousafzai won the Nobel Peace Prize at age 17).[6] The oldest Nobel Prize laureate in physics was Arthur Ashkin who was 96 years old when he was awarded the prize in 2018.[7]\n\n\nOnly five women have won the prize: Marie Curie (1903), Maria Goeppert-Mayer (1963), Donna Strickland (2018), Andrea Ghez (2020), and Anne L'Huillier (2023).[8] Before L'Huillier, each woman only ever received a quarter share of the prize, although Marie Curie did receive an unshared Nobel prize in chemistry in 1911. In 2023 L'Huillier received a one-third share.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n125. **^** \"He is considered a U.S. citizen by Nobel Prize Committee\". *Reuters*.

A 1974 paper and comprehensive review in *Reviews of Modern Physics* commented that \"while no one doubted the [mathematical] correctness of these arguments, no one quite believed that nature was diabolically clever enough to take advantage of them\",[87] adding that the theory had so far produced accurate answers that accorded with experiment, but it was unknown whether the theory was fundamentally correct.[88] By 1986 and again in the 1990s it became possible to write that understanding and proving the Higgs sector of the Standard Model was \"the central problem today in particle physics\".[25][26]\n\n\n\n#### Summary and impact of the PRL papers\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* The story of the Higgs theory by the authors of the PRL papers and others closely associated:\n\t+ Higgs, Peter (2010). \"My Life as a Boson\" (PDF).

It's worth noting that Englert's co-researcher Robert Brout had died in 2011 and could not be awarded the prize as the Nobel Prize is not given posthumously.\n\nThe discovery of the Higgs boson was a major scientific breakthrough that validated theories about the origin of mass in subatomic particles that had been proposed nearly 50 years earlier.

Isamu Akasaki (Japan)\n2. Hiroshi Amano (Japan)\n3. Shuji Nakamura (Japan/United States)\n\nThey were awarded the Nobel Prize \"for the invention of efficient blue light-emitting diodes (LEDs), which has enabled bright and energy-saving white light sources.\" This breakthrough was particularly significant because:\n\n1. Their invention of the blue LED was a crucial missing piece in LED technology. While red and green LEDs had existed for many years, the blue LED was necessary to create white LED light.\n\n2. This invention revolutionized lighting technology by making it possible to create energy-efficient white LED lights, which are now commonly used worldwide.\n\n3. The technology they developed has led to significant energy savings and has had a major impact on sustainable lighting solutions globally.\n\nThe significance of their work was further recognized when Shuji Nakamura, along with the other inventors, received several other prestigious awards, including:\n- The Millennium Technology Prize (2006)\n- The Global Energy Prize (2015)\n- The Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering (2021, along with other LED pioneers)\n\nTheir invention has become fundamental to modern lighting technology and has contributed significantly to energy-efficient lighting solutions that are both environmentally friendly and cost-effective.",

Kamioka.[2][5] This discovery helped prove the existence of neutrino oscillation and that neutrinos have mass. In 2015, Kajita shared the Nobel Prize in Physics with Canadian physicist Arthur McDonald, whose Sudbury Neutrino Observatory discovered similar results.[5] Kajita's and McDonald's work solved the longstanding Solar neutrino problem, which was a major discrepancy between the predicted and measured Solar neutrino fluxes, and indicated that the Standard Model, which required neutrinos to be massless, had weaknesses.[5] In a news conference at the University of Tokyo, shortly after the Nobel announcement, Kajita said, \"I want to thank the neutrinos, of course.

He studied physics at Saitama University and graduated in 1981. He received his doctorate in 1986 at the University of Tokyo.[2] At the University of Tokyo, he joined Masatoshi Koshiba's research group because neutrinos \"seemed like they might be interesting.\"\n\n\n\n## Career and research\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Specifically:\n\n- Takaaki Kajita and his team at the Super-Kamiokande facility in Japan discovered that when cosmic rays hit Earth's atmosphere, the resulting neutrinos switched between two different \"flavors\" before reaching their detector under Mt. Kamioka.\n\n- Arthur B. McDonald, working with the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory team, made similar discoveries about neutrino behavior.\n\nThe significance of their work:\n- Their discoveries solved the long-standing Solar neutrino problem, which was a major discrepancy between the predicted and measured Solar neutrino fluxes.\n- Their work proved that neutrinos have mass, which was contrary to the Standard Model of particle physics that had assumed neutrinos were massless.\n- This discovery indicated that the Standard Model of particle physics had weaknesses and needed to be revised.\n\nThe impact was so significant that Kajita, upon receiving the Nobel Prize, said at a news conference at the University of Tokyo, \"I want to thank the neutrinos, of course. And since neutrinos are created by cosmic rays, I want to thank them, too.\"\n\nThis breakthrough has been crucial for our understanding of the universe and the fundamental properties of subatomic particles.",
