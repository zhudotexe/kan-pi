In 2010, Perlmutter was named a Miller Senior Fellow of the Miller Institute at the University of California Berkeley.

Perlmutter received one-half of the cash prize, while Riess and Schmidt shared the other half.[11]\n\n\nIn 2014, Perlmutter received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.[12]\n\n\nPerlmutter, Schmidt, Riess and their teams shared the 2015 Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics with $3 million to be split among them.[13]\n\n\nA United States Department of Energy 2020 supercomputer is named Perlmutter in his honor.[14]\n\n\n\n## Family[edit]\n\n\nSaul Perlmutter has two sisters: Shira Perlmutter (b. 1956), a lawyer, and Tova Perlmutter (b. 1967), a nonprofit executive. He is married to Laura Nelson, an anthropologist at University of California, Berkeley, and has one daughter, Noa.[15]\n\n\n\n## Popular culture[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Saul Perlmutter** (born September 22, 1959) is a U.S. astrophysicist, a professor of physics at the University of California, Berkeley, where he holds the Franklin W. and Karen Weber Dabby Chair, and head of the International Supernova Cosmology Project at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. He is a member of both the American Academy of Arts & Sciences and the American Philosophical Society,[2] and was elected a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2003. He is also a member of the National Academy of Sciences. Perlmutter shared the 2006 Shaw Prize in Astronomy, the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics, and the 2015 Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics with Brian P. Schmidt and Adam Riess for providing evidence that the expansion of the universe is accelerating. Since 2021, he has been a member of the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST).[3]\n\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n8. **^** Saul Perlmutter (1986). \"An Astrometric Search for a Stellar Companion to the Sun\".

Wineland for \"ground-breaking experimental methods that enable measuring and manipulation of individual quantum systems\", a study of the particle of light, the photon.[2][3][4] This and his other works developed laser spectroscopy. Since 2001, Haroche is a professor at the Collège de France and holds the chair of quantum physics.\n\n\nIn 1971 he defended his doctoral thesis in physics at the University of Paris VI: his research had been conducted under the direction of Claude Cohen-Tannoudji.[5]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nHaroche was born in Casablanca, Morocco, to Albert Haroche (1920–1998), from a Moroccan Jewish family, and Valentine Haroche, born Roubleva (1921–1998), a teacher who was born in Odessa to a Jewish family of physicians who relocated to Morocco in the early 1920s. His father, a lawyer trained in Rabat, was one of seven children born to a family of teachers, Isaac and Esther Haroche, who worked at the *École de l’Alliance israélite* (AIU).[6][7][8][9][10][11][12]\n\n\nBoth paternal grandparents of Serge Haroche had been AIU students in their respective hometowns of Marrakesh and Tétouan (the school which Esther Azerad attended in Tétouan had been founded in 1862; it was the first school of the AIU network).[13]\n\n\nHaroche left Morocco and settled in France in 1956, at the end of the French protectorate treaty.\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nHaroche worked in the Centre national de la recherche scientifique (CNRS) as a research scientist from 1967 to 1975, and spent a year (1972–1973) as a visiting post-doc in Stanford University, in Arthur Leonard Schawlow's team. In 1975 he moved to a professor position at Paris VI University. At the same time he taught in other institutions, in particular at the École polytechnique (1973–1984), MIT (1980)[1], Harvard University (1981), Yale University (1984–1993) and Conservatoire national des arts et métiers (2000). He was head of the Physics department at the École normale supérieure from 1994 to 2000.\n\n\nSince 2001, Haroche has been a professor at the Collège de France and holds the chair of quantum physics.\nHe is a member of the Société Française de Physique, the European Physical society and a fellow and member of the American Physical Society.\n\n\nIn September 2012, Serge Haroche was elected by his peers to the position of administrator of the Collège de France.\n\n\nOn 9 October 2012 Haroche was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics, together with the American physicist David Wineland, for their work regarding measurement and manipulation of individual quantum systems.\n\n\nIn 2020, Haroche was appointed by European Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth Mariya Gabriel to serve on an independent search committee for the next president of the European Research Council (ERC), chaired by Helga Nowotny.[14]\n\n\n\n## Research[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Serge Haroche (who won Nobel Prize in Physics in 2012) visited Stockholm, June 2016, as a member of the Wallenberg Foundation Scientific Advisory Board.\nHaroche works primarily in atomic physics and quantum optics.[15][16][17][18][19][20][21] He is principally known for showing quantum decoherence by experimental observation, while working with colleagues at the École normale supérieure in Paris in 1996.\n\n\nAfter a PhD dissertation on dressed atoms under the supervision of Claude Cohen-Tannoudji (himself a Nobel Prize recipient) from 1967 to 1971, he developed new methods for laser spectroscopy, based on the study of quantum beats and superradiance. He then moved on to Rydberg atoms, giant atomic states particularly sensitive to microwaves, which makes them well adapted for studying the interactions between light and matter. He showed that such atoms, coupled to a superconducting cavity containing a few photons, are well-suited to the testing of quantum decoherence and to the realization of quantum logic operations necessary for the treatment of quantum information.\n\n\n\n## Awards[edit]\n\n\nSerge Haroche after his Nobel Lecture\n* Commander of the French Legion of Honour\n* 1988 Einstein Prize for Laser Science (awarded at *Lasers* '88).\n* 1990 Fellow of the American Physical Society[22]\n* 1992 The Humboldt Prize\n* 1993 Albert A. Michelson Medal by the Franklin Institute[23]\n* 2007 Charles Hard Townes Award[24] by the OSA\n* 2009 CNRS Gold medal\n* 2012 Nobel Prize in Physics (shared with David J. Wineland)[2]\n* 2017 IEEE Honorary Membership\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nHaroche currently lives in Paris; he is married to the sociologist Claudine Haroche (née Zeligson), also descending from the Russian Jewish émigrés family, with two children (aged 40 and 43).[25][26][27] He is the uncle of French singer–songwriter and actor Raphaël Haroche (known as Raphaël, his stage name).[28]\n\n\n\n## Bibliography[edit]\n\n\n* Serge Haroche, Jean-Michel Raimond, *Exploring the quantum.

John Bardeen is the only laureate to win the prize twice—in 1956 and 1972.\n\n\nWilliam Lawrence Bragg was the youngest Nobel laureate in physics; he won the prize in 1915 at the age of 25. He was also the youngest laureate for any Nobel prize until 2014 (when Malala Yousafzai won the Nobel Peace Prize at age 17).[6] The oldest Nobel Prize laureate in physics was Arthur Ashkin who was 96 years old when he was awarded the prize in 2018.[7]\n\n\nOnly five women have won the prize: Marie Curie (1903), Maria Goeppert-Mayer (1963), Donna Strickland (2018), Andrea Ghez (2020), and Anne L'Huillier (2023).[8] Before L'Huillier, each woman only ever received a quarter share of the prize, although Marie Curie did receive an unshared Nobel prize in chemistry in 1911. In 2023 L'Huillier received a one-third share.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n125. **^** \"He is considered a U.S. citizen by Nobel Prize Committee\". *Reuters*.

Kamioka.[2][5] This discovery helped prove the existence of neutrino oscillation and that neutrinos have mass. In 2015, Kajita shared the Nobel Prize in Physics with Canadian physicist Arthur McDonald, whose Sudbury Neutrino Observatory discovered similar results.[5] Kajita's and McDonald's work solved the longstanding Solar neutrino problem, which was a major discrepancy between the predicted and measured Solar neutrino fluxes, and indicated that the Standard Model, which required neutrinos to be massless, had weaknesses.[5] In a news conference at the University of Tokyo, shortly after the Nobel announcement, Kajita said, \"I want to thank the neutrinos, of course.

He studied physics at Saitama University and graduated in 1981. He received his doctorate in 1986 at the University of Tokyo.[2] At the University of Tokyo, he joined Masatoshi Koshiba's research group because neutrinos \"seemed like they might be interesting.\"\n\n\n\n## Career and research\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_01MdDD1EFPBA7cQHtqohCxyR","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
