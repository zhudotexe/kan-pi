Google.com & YouTube.com:\n- Owned by Google LLC, which is a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc.\n- Alphabet Inc. is a publicly traded company (NASDAQ: GOOGL and GOOG)\n- Key controlling shareholders include:\n  * Larry Page (co-founder)\n  * Sergey Brin (co-founder)\n- Current CEO: Sundar Pichai\n\n2. Facebook.com & Instagram.com:\n- Owned by Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook, Inc.)\n- Meta is a publicly traded company (NASDAQ: META)\n- Mark Zuckerberg remains the controlling shareholder and CEO\n- Instagram was acquired by Facebook (now Meta) in 2012\n\n3. Twitter.com (X.com):\n- Owned by X Corp.\n- Privately held company owned by Elon Musk following his $44 billion acquisition in October 2022\n- Elon Musk serves as owner and CTO\n- Linda Yaccarino serves as CEO\n\nIt's worth noting that while Google/YouTube and Facebook/Instagram are part of publicly traded companies (meaning shares are available to the public), they maintain special voting structures that ensure their founders retain control over company decisions. Twitter (X) is now a private company following Elon Musk's acquisition, meaning it's no longer publicly traded.",
