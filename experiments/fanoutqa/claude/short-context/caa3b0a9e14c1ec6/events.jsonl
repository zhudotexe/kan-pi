In 2023, a government recount of the islands with digital maps increased the total from 6,852 to 14,125 islands.[9] The five main islands are (from north to south) Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, Kyushu and Okinawa. Three of the four major islands (Honshu, Kyushu and Shikoku) are separated by narrow straits of the Seto Inland Sea and form a natural entity. The 6,847 smaller islands are called remote islands.[10][11] This includes the Bonin Islands, Daitō Islands, Minami-Tori-shima, Okinotorishima, the Ryukyu Islands, the Volcano Islands, Nansei Islands, and the Nanpō Islands, as well as numerous islets, of which 430 are inhabited. The Senkaku Islands are administered by Japan but disputed by China. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n*Shikoku* (四国) is the second smallest of the five main islands (after Okinawa island), 18,800 km2 (7,300 sq mi). It is located south of Honshu and northeast of Kyushu. It has the second smallest population of 3,845,534 million (2015)[11][124] and the third highest population density of 204.55 persons/km2.\n\n\n\n### Hokkaido[edit]\n\n\n*Hokkaido* (北海道) is the second largest island of Japan, and the largest and northernmost prefecture. The Tsugaru Strait separates Hokkaido from Honshu.[125] It has the third largest population of the five main islands with 5,383,579 (2015)[11][116] and the lowest population density with just 64.5 persons/km2 (2016).

For example, maps and geography textbooks divide Japan into the eight regions, weather reports usually give the weather by region, and many businesses and institutions use their home region as part of their name (Kinki Nippon Railway, Chūgoku Bank, Tohoku University, etc.).

About 80 million of the urban population is heavily concentrated on the Pacific coast of Honshu.[24]\n\n\n81% of the population lives on Honshu, 10% on Kyushu, 4.2% on Hokkaido, 3% on Shikoku, 1.1% in Okinawa Prefecture and 0.7% on other Japanese islands such as the Nanpō Islands. Nearly 1 in 3 Japanese people live in the Greater Tokyo Area, and over half live in the Kanto, Kinki, and Chukyo metropolitan areas.[115]\n\n\n\n### Honshu[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Japanese archipelago has diverse landscapes.[8] For example, the northern part of Hokkaido has a taiga biome.[103] Hokkaido has 22% of Japan's forestland with coniferous trees (Sakhalin fir and Sakhalin spruce) and broad-leaved trees (Japanese oak, birch and Painted maple). The seasonal views change throughout the year.[104] In the south, the Yaeyama Islands are in the subtropics with numerous species of subtropical and tropical plants, and mangrove forests.[105][106] Most natural islands have mountain ranges in the center with coastal plains.\n\n\n\n* List of National Parks of Japan\n* List of National Geoparks in Japan\n* Wildlife Protection Areas in Japan\n* List of Ramsar sites in Japan\n* Cultural Landscapes\n\n\n### Places of Scenic Beauty[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 43 | Ōshima (Ehime) | 41.87 | 16.17 |  |\n| 44 | Ōsakikamijima | 38.27 | 14.78 |  |\n| 45 | Kuchinoerabu-jima | 38.04 | 14.69 |  |\n| 46 | Hisaka | 37.23 | 14.37 |  |\n| 47 | Innoshima | 35.03 | 13.53 |  |\n| 48 | Nakanoshima (in Kagoshima) | 34.47 | 13.31 | Tokara Islands |\n| 49 | Hario Island | 33.16 | 12.80 |  |\n| 50 | Nakanoshima (in Shimane) | 32.21 | 12.44 | Oki Islands |\n\n\n### Northern Territories[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Kuril Islands with Russian names.

It is part of the Daisetsuzan Volcanic Group of the Ishikari Mountains, it is located in the northern part of the Daisetsuzan National Park.\n\n\nIts native Ainu name is *Kamui-mintara*, which means \"the playground of the gods\".[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe mountain is popular with hikers in the summer and can be easily reached from Asahidake Onsen via Asahidake Ropeway. During winter, the mountain is open for use by skiers and snowboarders.\n\n\nSugatami Pond, directly below the peak, is famous for its reflection of the peaks, snow, and steam escaping from the volcanic vents.\n\n\n\n\n## History\n\n[edit]\n\nSulphur was once mined in the fumarolic areas.[2]\n\n\n\n## Geology\n\n[edit]\n\nMount Asahi is an active stratovolcano, 2,291 metres (7,516 ft) in height[2] that arose 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) southwest of the Ohachi-Daira caldera.[2] The Japan Meteorological Agency gave the region rank C[4] in volcanic activity. The volcano consists mainly of andesite and dacite,[4] Holocene volcanic non-alkali mafic rock less than 18,000 years old.[3] In addition to the main peak, there is a smaller volcano emerging from the southeast shoulder of the mountain, Mount Ushiro Asahi or *Rear Mount Asahi* (後旭岳, *Ushiro-Asahi-dake*).\n\n\n\n### Eruptive history\n\n[edit]\n\nWhilst there is no historical record of the eruptions of Mount Asahi, tephrochronology and radiocarbon dating have determined the following events:[2]\n\n\n\n* 3200 BC ± 75 years, Asahi Soria deposit, corrected radiocarbon dating, explosive eruption\n* 2800 BC ± 100 years, As-A tephra, corrected radiocarbon dating, explosive eruption and phreatic explosions\n* 1450 BC ± 50 years, As-B tephra, uncorrected radiocarbon dating, explosive eruption and phreatic explosions\n* 500 BC ± 50 years, Ash-b tephra, tephrochonology, explosive eruption and phreatic explosions and debris avalanches\n* 1739, tephrochronology, explosive eruption and phreatic explosions with possible eruption of the central vent and radial good\n\n\nMount Asahi currently exhibits steam activity in the form of fumaroles.[4]\n\n\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]\n\n* List of volcanoes in Japan\n* List of mountains in Japan\n\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n1. **^** Geological Survey Institute Archived 2011-05-27 at the Wayback Machine topographic map Asahi-dake 旭岳\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** \"Daisetsu\". *Global Volcanism Program*.

It is the tallest mountain in Japan, the second-highest volcano located on an island in Asia (after Mount Kerinci on the island of Sumatra), and seventh-highest peak of an island on Earth.[1] Mount Fuji last erupted from 1707 to 1708.[4][5] The mountain is located about 100 km (62 mi) southwest of Tokyo and is visible from the Japanese capital on clear days. Mount Fuji's exceptionally symmetrical cone, which is covered in snow for about five months of the year, is commonly used as a cultural icon of Japan and is frequently depicted in art and photography, as well as visited by sightseers, hikers and mountain climbers.[6]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Hida Mountains  (Northern Alps) | * Mt.

They are (clockwise, starting north): Kawaguchiko, Subashiri, Gotemba, and Fujinomiya routes.[74] Climbers usually start at the fifth stations, as these are reachable by car or by bus. The summit is the tenth station on each trail. The stations on different routes are at different elevations; the highest fifth station is located at Fujinomiya, followed by Yoshida, Subashiri, and Gotemba. There are four additional routes from the foot of the mountain: Shojiko, Yoshida, Suyama, and Murayama routes.[75]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMount Fuji as seen from the air and from the window of a bullet train, 2014\n![](image)Fuji in early summer seen from the International Space Station (May 2001)\nMount Fuji is a very distinctive feature of the geography of Japan. It stands 3,776.24 m (12,389 ft) tall and is located near the Pacific coast of central Honshu, just southwest of Tokyo. It straddles the boundary of Shizuoka and Yamanashi prefectures. Four small cities surround it: Gotemba to the east, Fujiyoshida to the north, Fujinomiya to the southwest, and Fuji to the south. It is surrounded by five lakes: Lake Kawaguchi, Lake Yamanaka, Lake Sai, Lake Motosu and Lake Shōji.[37] They, and nearby Lake Ashi, provide views of the mountain. The mountain is part of the Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park. It can be seen more distantly from Yokohama, Tokyo, and sometimes as far as Chiba, Saitama, Tochigi, Ibaraki and Lake Hamana when the sky is clear. It has been photographed from space during a space shuttle mission.[38]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Geology |\n| Age of rock | 100,000 years |\n| Mountain type | Stratovolcano |\n| Last eruption | 1707–08 |\n| Climbing |\n| First ascent | 663 by En no Odzunu (役行者, En no gyoja, En no Odzuno) |\n| Easiest route | Hiking |\n| \n |\n| UNESCO World Heritage Site\n |\n| Official name | Fujisan, sacred place and source of artistic inspiration |\n| Criteria | Cultural: iii, vi |\n| Reference | 1418 |\n| Inscription | 2013 (37th Session) |\n| Area | 20,702.1 ha |\n| Buffer zone | 49,627.7 ha |\n|  |\n\n\n\n\n| Mount Fuji |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| ![](image)\"Mt.

Fuji once in their lifetime, but only a fool would climb it twice.[30][31] It remains a popular symbol in Japanese culture, including making numerous movie appearances,[32] inspiring the Infiniti logo,[33] and even appearing in medicine with the Mount Fuji sign.[34][35]\n\n\nIn September 2004, the staffed weather station at the summit was closed after 72 years in operation. Observers monitored radar sweeps that detected typhoons and heavy rains. The station, which was the highest in Japan at 3,780 m (12,402 ft), was replaced by a fully automated meteorological system.[36]\n\n\nMount Fuji was added to the World Heritage List as a Cultural Site on June 22, 2013.[7]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThere are eight peaks around the crater at the summit. The highest point in Japan, Ken-ga-mine, is where the Mount Fuji Radar System used to be (it was replaced by an automated system in 2004). Climbers are able to visit each of these peaks.\n\n\n\n### Paragliding[edit]\n\n\nParagliders take off in the vicinity of the fifth station Gotemba parking lot, between Subashiri and Hōei-zan peak on the south side of the mountain, in addition to several other locations, depending on wind direction. Several paragliding schools use the wide sandy/grassy slope between Gotemba and Subashiri parking lots as a training hill.\n\n\n\n## In culture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Outer shrine of Fujisan Hongū Sengen Taisha\n### Shinto mythology[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Fujisan jōhō kōnā\" 富士山情報コーナー [Mt.

According to the historian H. Byron Earhart, \"in medieval times it eventually came to be seen by Japanese as the \"number one\" mountain of the known world of the three countries of India, China, and Japan\".[17] The mountain is mentioned in Japanese literature throughout the ages and is the subject of many poems.[18]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Aerial panorama of Mount Fuji from Lake Saiko, June 2023\n![](image)Aerial panorama of Mount Fuji with Saiko Iyashi-no-Sato Nenba in the foreground, June 2023\nModern linguist Alexander Vovin proposes an alternative hypothesis based on Old Japanese reading \\*/puⁿzi/: the word may have been borrowed from Eastern Old Japanese \\*/pu nusi/ 火主, meaning \"fire master\".[15]\n\n\n\n### Variations[edit]\n\n\nIn English, the mountain is known as Mount Fuji. Some sources refer to it as \"Fuji-san\", \"Fujiyama\" or, redundantly, \"Mt. Fujiyama\". Japanese speakers refer to the mountain as \"Fuji-san\". This \"san\" is not the honorific suffix used with people's names, such as Watanabe-san, but the Sino-Japanese reading of the character *yama* (山, \"mountain\") used in Sino-Japanese compounds. In Nihon-shiki and Kunrei-shiki romanization, the name is transliterated as *Huzi*.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Historical illustration of the routes to Mount Fuji\n![](image)*Torii* near the summit\n![](image)Hikers climbing Mount Fuji\nApproximately 300,000 people climbed Mount Fuji in 2009.[70] The most popular period for people to hike up Mount Fuji is from July to August, while huts and other facilities are operating and the weather is warmest.[70] Buses to the trail heads typically used by climbers start running on July 1.[71] Climbing from October to May is very strongly discouraged, after a number of high-profile deaths and severe cold weather.[72] Most Japanese climb the mountain at night in order to be in a position at or near the summit when the sun rises. The morning light is called 御来光 *goraikō*, \"arrival of light\".[73]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_011gVqTHabfy6jVqTXnH6pjL","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

This mountain is one of the 100 famous mountains in Japan. It is the highest mountain in Western Japan and the island of Shikoku.\n\n\n\n\n## Outline[edit]\n\n\nMount Ishizuchi is the highest mountain on the island of Shikoku and also the highest mountain west of Mount Haku. It is known as 'the roof of Shikoku' and the sharp, rocky summit resembles a huge stone hammer (石鎚, *ishizuchi*).\n\n\nMount Ishizuchi is an important object of worship in this region and one of the major centers of Shugendō, a sect of mixture of Shinto and Buddhism. At the top of the mountain there is a small shrine called the Ishizuchi Shrine. This mountain is also known as one of Seven Holy Mountains (七霊山, *nana reizan*). There are several sets of heavy iron chains (鎖, *kusari*) leading up to the summit and this is the route many pilgrims opt to take, the longest set being 68m. However, it is possible to hike all the way to the peak along a trail which includes stairs and ramps with handrails.\n\n\nThe climbing season opens every year on July 1, and women are forbidden from climbing the mountain on this day.[2] Between mid-October and mid-November, people come from far and wide to view the autumn colours.\n\n\nThe area around Mount Ishizuchi is a major part of Ishizuchi Quasi-National Park.\n\n\n\n## Access[edit]\n\n\n* Sanchōjōju Station of Ishizuchi Ropeway\n* Ishizuchi Tsuchigoya Bus Stop of Iyotetsu Bus\n\n\n* ![Mount Ishizuchi from South](image)\n\nMount Ishizuchi from South\n* ![Top of Mount Ishizuchi](image)\n\nTop of Mount Ishizuchi\n* ![A view of the middle of the mountain](image)\n\nA view of the middle of the mountain\n* ![A stone wall of the mountain](image)\n\nA stone wall of the mountain\n* ![Mt.

It is one of the 100 Famous Japanese Mountains. It is part of the Aso-Kujū National Park.\n\n\n\n\n## Summary\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Kujū range consists of a dozen or so volcanic bodies gathered in a region of 13km east-west and 10km north-south. The mountains in the range include:\n\n\n\n* Kujū Mountains\n\t+ Mount Kujū (1,787 m)- The main peak (久住山)\n\t+ Mount Nakadake (1,791 m)- The highest peak in Kyushu\n\t+ Mount Inahoshi (1,774 m)\n\t+ Mount Hōsshō (1,762 m)\n\t+ Mount Mimata (1,745 m)\n* Taisen Mountains\n\t+ Mount Taisen (1,786 m)\n\t+ Mount North (Kita) Taisen (1,706 m)\n\t+ Mount Heiji (1,642 m)\n\n\nThe Kujū volcanic group is mainly composed of andesite and dacite, which is defined as the volcanic activity above the Miyagi pyroclastic flow deposit which formed about 200,000 years ago. The north and south areas of Mt. Kujū are plateau grasslands whose main industry is dairy farming.\n\n\n\n## Gallery\n\n[edit]\n\n* ![Mount Kujū from Mount Aso](image)\n\nMount Kujū from Mount Aso\n* ![Mount Iō from Chōjabaru](image)\n\nMount Iō from Chōjabaru\n* ![Mount Hōsshō and Mount Iō from Chōjabaru](image)\n\nMount Hōsshō and Mount Iō from Chōjabaru\n* ![Mount Kujū from Narukogawa Gorge](image)\n\nMount Kujū from Narukogawa Gorge\n* ![Mount Taisen](image)\n\nMount Taisen\n* ![Kujū Flower Gardens and Kujū Mountains](image)\n\nKujū Flower Gardens and Kujū Mountains\n* ![Mount Kujū from Makinoto Pass with Mount Mimata on the right](image)\n\nMount Kujū from Makinoto Pass with Mount Mimata on the right\n\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]\n\n* List of Ultras of Japan\n\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** \"Japan Ultra-Prominences\".

It has an elevation of 503 m (1,650 ft), but Yonaha-dake triangulation station is located at the next peak of elevation of 498 m (1,634 ft).\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\n\"Mount Yonaha\" in the Japanese language is formed from three kanji, 与, 那 and 覇. The kanji are ateji, or kanji used phonetically to represent native or borrowed words.\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMount Yonaha is approximately 80 km (50 mi) north of the capital of Okinawa Prefecture, Naha,[2] and approximately 4.5 km (3 mi) east of the Okuma district (奥間集落, *Okuma shūraku*) of Kunigami. It is formed from schist, phyllite, and sandstone, and dates from the Tertiary period to the mid-Mesozoic era.[3] It appears as a gentle slope, but its summit is surrounded by a series of complex valleys.[1] It is the highest mountain on the island and the second highest in the prefecture after Mount Omoto 525.5 m (1,724 ft) in Ishigaki, Okinawa.[3] It is part of the Okinawa Kaigan Quasi-National Park, and the highest mountain in the park. A paved road extends from the village of Kunigami at the mountain's base to its summit.[3]\n\n\nMount Yonaha is home to the largest waterfall on Okinawa Island, the Hiji Waterfall (26 m (85 ft)).[2] Due to the effect of the Kuroshio Current, the mountain is almost always covered in fog.[2]\n\n\n\n## Rivers[edit]\n\n\n* Okuma River (奥間川, *Okuma-gawa*)\n* Hiji River (比地川, *Hiji-gawa*)\n* Toko River (床川, *Toko-gawa*)\n\n\n## Yanbaru forest[edit]\n\n\nMount Yonaha is at the center of the Yanbaru forest that spans the villages of Higashi, Kunigami, and Ōgimi. Yanbaru contains some of the last large surviving tracts of subtropical rainforest in Asia, and the mountain is lush with evergreens forests. While Mount Yonaha is an important natural habitat to numerous species of plants, birds, and animals, its ecology has been negatively affected by agricultural development at its base, and lumbering and the subsequent establishment of second-growth forest.[3]\n\n\n\n## Military installation[edit]\n\n\nMount Yonaha's summit is approximately 2 km (1 mi) west of the border of Camp Gonsalves, a jungle warfare training center of the United States Marine Corps.\n\n\n\n## External links[edit]\n\n\n* 与那覇岳天然保護区 (in Japanese)\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Yonaha-dake\". *Nihon Rekishi Chimei Taikei (日本歴史地名大系 “Compendium of Japanese Historical Place Names”)* (in Japanese).

It is part of the Daisetsuzan Volcanic Group of the Ishikari Mountains, it is located in the northern part of the Daisetsuzan National Park.\n\n\nIts native Ainu name is *Kamui-mintara*, which means \"the playground of the gods\".[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe mountain is popular with hikers in the summer and can be easily reached from Asahidake Onsen via Asahidake Ropeway. During winter, the mountain is open for use by skiers and snowboarders.\n\n\nSugatami Pond, directly below the peak, is famous for its reflection of the peaks, snow, and steam escaping from the volcanic vents.\n\n\n\n\n## History\n\n[edit]\n\nSulphur was once mined in the fumarolic areas.[2]\n\n\n\n## Geology\n\n[edit]\n\nMount Asahi is an active stratovolcano, 2,291 metres (7,516 ft) in height[2] that arose 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) southwest of the Ohachi-Daira caldera.[2] The Japan Meteorological Agency gave the region rank C[4] in volcanic activity. The volcano consists mainly of andesite and dacite,[4] Holocene volcanic non-alkali mafic rock less than 18,000 years old.[3] In addition to the main peak, there is a smaller volcano emerging from the southeast shoulder of the mountain, Mount Ushiro Asahi or *Rear Mount Asahi* (後旭岳, *Ushiro-Asahi-dake*).\n\n\n\n### Eruptive history\n\n[edit]\n\nWhilst there is no historical record of the eruptions of Mount Asahi, tephrochronology and radiocarbon dating have determined the following events:[2]\n\n\n\n* 3200 BC ± 75 years, Asahi Soria deposit, corrected radiocarbon dating, explosive eruption\n* 2800 BC ± 100 years, As-A tephra, corrected radiocarbon dating, explosive eruption and phreatic explosions\n* 1450 BC ± 50 years, As-B tephra, uncorrected radiocarbon dating, explosive eruption and phreatic explosions\n* 500 BC ± 50 years, Ash-b tephra, tephrochonology, explosive eruption and phreatic explosions and debris avalanches\n* 1739, tephrochronology, explosive eruption and phreatic explosions with possible eruption of the central vent and radial good\n\n\nMount Asahi currently exhibits steam activity in the form of fumaroles.[4]\n\n\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]\n\n* List of volcanoes in Japan\n* List of mountains in Japan\n\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n1. **^** Geological Survey Institute Archived 2011-05-27 at the Wayback Machine topographic map Asahi-dake 旭岳\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** \"Daisetsu\". *Global Volcanism Program*.

It is the tallest mountain in Japan, the second-highest volcano located on an island in Asia (after Mount Kerinci on the island of Sumatra), and seventh-highest peak of an island on Earth.[1] Mount Fuji last erupted from 1707 to 1708.[4][5] The mountain is located about 100 km (62 mi) southwest of Tokyo and is visible from the Japanese capital on clear days. Mount Fuji's exceptionally symmetrical cone, which is covered in snow for about five months of the year, is commonly used as a cultural icon of Japan and is frequently depicted in art and photography, as well as visited by sightseers, hikers and mountain climbers.[6]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Hida Mountains  (Northern Alps) | * Mt.

The summit is the tenth station on each trail. The stations on different routes are at different elevations; the highest fifth station is located at Fujinomiya, followed by Yoshida, Subashiri, and Gotemba.

Fuji once in their lifetime, but only a fool would climb it twice.[30][31] It remains a popular symbol in Japanese culture, including making numerous movie appearances,[32] inspiring the Infiniti logo,[33] and even appearing in medicine with the Mount Fuji sign.[34][35]\n\n\nIn September 2004, the staffed weather station at the summit was closed after 72 years in operation. Observers monitored radar sweeps that detected typhoons and heavy rains. The station, which was the highest in Japan at 3,780 m (12,402 ft), was replaced by a fully automated meteorological system.[36]\n\n\nMount Fuji was added to the World Heritage List as a Cultural Site on June 22, 2013.[7]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMount Fuji as seen from the air and from the window of a bullet train, 2014\n![](image)Fuji in early summer seen from the International Space Station (May 2001)\nMount Fuji is a very distinctive feature of the geography of Japan. It stands 3,776.24 m (12,389 ft) tall and is located near the Pacific coast of central Honshu, just southwest of Tokyo. It straddles the boundary of Shizuoka and Yamanashi prefectures. Four small cities surround it: Gotemba to the east, Fujiyoshida to the north, Fujinomiya to the southwest, and Fuji to the south. It is surrounded by five lakes: Lake Kawaguchi, Lake Yamanaka, Lake Sai, Lake Motosu and Lake Shōji.[37] They, and nearby Lake Ashi, provide views of the mountain. The mountain is part of the Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park. It can be seen more distantly from Yokohama, Tokyo, and sometimes as far as Chiba, Saitama, Tochigi, Ibaraki and Lake Hamana when the sky is clear. It has been photographed from space during a space shuttle mission.[38]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n40. **^** Miyaji, Naomichi. \"Geology of Fuji Volcano\".

Mount Fuji is also located near three island arcs: the Southwestern Japan Arc, the Northeastern Japan Arc, and the Izu-Bonin-Mariana Arc.[43] The Fuji triple junction is only ~400 kilometers from the Boso Triple Junction.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n15. **^** Vovin, Alexander (January 1, 2017). \"On the Etymology of the Name of Mt.

This mountain is one of the 100 famous mountains in Japan. It is the highest mountain in Western Japan and the island of Shikoku.\n\n\n\n\n## Outline[edit]\n\n\nMount Ishizuchi is the highest mountain on the island of Shikoku and also the highest mountain west of Mount Haku. It is known as 'the roof of Shikoku' and the sharp, rocky summit resembles a huge stone hammer (石鎚, *ishizuchi*).\n\n\nMount Ishizuchi is an important object of worship in this region and one of the major centers of Shugendō, a sect of mixture of Shinto and Buddhism. At the top of the mountain there is a small shrine called the Ishizuchi Shrine. This mountain is also known as one of Seven Holy Mountains (七霊山, *nana reizan*). There are several sets of heavy iron chains (鎖, *kusari*) leading up to the summit and this is the route many pilgrims opt to take, the longest set being 68m. However, it is possible to hike all the way to the peak along a trail which includes stairs and ramps with handrails.\n\n\nThe climbing season opens every year on July 1, and women are forbidden from climbing the mountain on this day.[2] Between mid-October and mid-November, people come from far and wide to view the autumn colours.\n\n\nThe area around Mount Ishizuchi is a major part of Ishizuchi Quasi-National Park.\n\n\n\n## Access[edit]\n\n\n* Sanchōjōju Station of Ishizuchi Ropeway\n* Ishizuchi Tsuchigoya Bus Stop of Iyotetsu Bus\n\n\n* ![Mount Ishizuchi from South](image)\n\nMount Ishizuchi from South\n* ![Top of Mount Ishizuchi](image)\n\nTop of Mount Ishizuchi\n* ![A view of the middle of the mountain](image)\n\nA view of the middle of the mountain\n* ![A stone wall of the mountain](image)\n\nA stone wall of the mountain\n* ![Mt.
