Eurostat places Paris (6.5 million people) behind London (8 million) and ahead of Berlin (3.5 million), based on the 2012 populations of what Eurostat calls \"urban audit core cities\".[157]\nThe population of Paris today is lower than its historical peak of 2.9 million in 1921.[158] The principal reasons were a significant decline in household size, and a dramatic migration of residents to the suburbs between 1962 and 1975. Factors in the migration included de-industrialisation, high rent, the gentrification of many inner quarters, the transformation of living space into offices, and greater affluence among working families. The city's population loss came to a temporary halt at the beginning of the 21st century; the population increased from 2,125,246 in 1999 to 2,240,621 in 2012, before declining again slightly in 2017, 2018, and again in 2021.[159][160]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Répertoire national des élus: les maires\" (in French). data.gouv.fr, Plateforme ouverte des données publiques françaises. 16 December 2022.

According to INSEE, the population has dropped by 122,919, or about five percent, over the past decade. The Mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, declared that this illustrated the \"de-densification\" of the city, creating more green space and less crowding.[153][154] Despite the drop, Paris remains the most densely-populated city in Europe, with 252 residents per hectare, not counting parks.[155] This drop was attributed partly to a lower birth rate, the departure of middle-class residents and the possible loss of housing in the city due to short-term rentals for tourism.[156]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n200. **^** \"Neighborhoods of Paris with more than 40 percent living below poverty line\" (in French).

It is the main component of an administrative area of Greater Barcelona, with a population of 3,218,071 in an area of 636 km2 (246 sq mi) (density 5,060 inhabitants/km2). The population of the urban area was 4,840,000.[3] It is the central nucleus of the Barcelona metropolitan area, which relies on a population of 5,474,482.[4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Barcelona** (/ˌbɑːrsəˈloʊnə/ ⓘ *BAR-sə-LOH-nə*, Catalan: [bəɾsəˈlonə] ⓘ, Spanish: [baɾθeˈlona] ⓘ) is a city on the northeastern coast of Spain. It is the capital and largest city of the autonomous community of Catalonia, as well as the second-most populous municipality of Spain. With a population of 1.6 million within city limits,[7] its urban area extends to numerous neighbouring municipalities within the province of Barcelona and is home to around 4.8 million people,[3] making it the fifth most populous urban area in the European Union after Paris, the Ruhr area, Madrid and Milan.[3] It is one of the largest metropolises on the Mediterranean Sea, located on the coast between the mouths of the rivers Llobregat and Besòs, bounded to the west by the Serra de Collserola mountain range.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe result was a large-scale immigration from poorer regions of Spain (particularly Andalusia, Murcia and Galicia), which in turn led to rapid urbanisation.\n\n\n\n### Late twentieth century[edit]\n\n\nIn 1992, Barcelona hosted the Summer Olympics. The after-effects of this are credited with driving major changes in what had, up until then, been a largely industrial city. As part of the preparation for the games, industrial buildings along the sea-front were demolished and 3 km (2 mi) of beach were created. New construction increased the road capacity of the city by 17%, the sewage handling capacity by 27% and the amount of new green areas and beaches by 78%. Between 1990 and 2004, the number of hotel rooms in the city doubled. Perhaps more importantly, the outside perception of the city was changed making, by 2012, Barcelona the 12th most popular city destination in the world and the 5th amongst European cities.[50][51][52][53][54]\n\n\n\n### Recent history[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1900, Barcelona had a population of 533,000,[64] which grew steadily but slowly until 1950, when it started absorbing a high number of people from other less-industrialised parts of Spain. Barcelona's population peaked in 1979 at 1,906,998, and fell throughout the 1980s and 1990s as more people sought a higher quality of life in outlying cities in the Barcelona Metropolitan Area. After bottoming out in 2000 with 1,496,266 residents, the city's population began to rise again as younger people started to return, causing a great increase in housing prices.[78]\n\n\n\n### Population density[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n96. **^** \"The Monocle Quality of Life Survey 2015\". *Monocle*. 2015.

Despite its moderate pickpocket rate, Barcelona is considered one of the safest cities in terms of security and personal safety,[109] mainly because of a sophisticated policing strategy that has dropped crime by 32% in just over three years and has led it to be considered the 15th safest city in the world by *Business Insider* in 2016.[110]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2016, about 59% of the inhabitants of the city were born in Catalonia and 18.5% coming from the rest of the country. In addition to that, 22.5% of the population was born outside of Spain, a proportion which has more than doubled since 2001 and more than quintupled since 1996 when it was 8.6% respectively 3.9%.[75]\n\n\nThe most important region of origin of migrants is Europe, with many coming from Italy (26,676) or France (13,506).[75] Moreover, many migrants come from Latin American nations such as Bolivia, Ecuador or Colombia. Since the 1990s, and similar to other migrants, many Latin Americans have settled in northern parts of the city.[83]\n\n\nThere exists a relatively large Pakistani community in Barcelona with up to twenty thousand nationals. The community consists of significantly more men than women. Many of the Pakistanis are living in Ciutat Vella. First Pakistani migrants came in the 1970s, with increasing numbers in the 1990s.[84]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n8. **^** \"2012 Global Cities Index\".

The increased cost of housing has led to a slight decline (−16.6%) in the population over the last two decades of the 20th century as many families move out into the suburbs. This decline has been reversed since 2001, as a new wave of immigration (particularly from Latin America and from Morocco) has gathered pace.[59]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_017DWqN4JPyfv1X4ZgQUDnPc","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

Eurostat places Paris (6.5 million people) behind London (8 million) and ahead of Berlin (3.5 million), based on the 2012 populations of what Eurostat calls \"urban audit core cities\".[157]\nThe population of Paris today is lower than its historical peak of 2.9 million in 1921.[158] The principal reasons were a significant decline in household size, and a dramatic migration of residents to the suburbs between 1962 and 1975. Factors in the migration included de-industrialisation, high rent, the gentrification of many inner quarters, the transformation of living space into offices, and greater affluence among working families. The city's population loss came to a temporary halt at the beginning of the 21st century; the population increased from 2,125,246 in 1999 to 2,240,621 in 2012, before declining again slightly in 2017, 2018, and again in 2021.[159][160]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe official estimated population of the City of Paris on 1 January 1, 2023 was 2,102,650, down from 2,165,423 on January 1, 2022, according to the INSEE, the official French statistical agency. According to INSEE, the population has dropped by 122,919, or about five percent, over the past decade. The Mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, declared that this illustrated the \"de-densification\" of the city, creating more green space and less crowding.[153][154] Despite the drop, Paris remains the most densely-populated city in Europe, with 252 residents per hectare, not counting parks.[155] This drop was attributed partly to a lower birth rate, the departure of middle-class residents and the possible loss of housing in the city due to short-term rentals for tourism.[156]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMain article: Demographics of Paris\n\n![](image)City of Paris population pyramid in 2022\n\n\n| 2019 Census Paris Region |\n| --- |\n| (*Île-de-France*)[151][152] |\n| \n\n|  Country/territoryof birth |  Population |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![France](image) Metropolitan France |  9,215,134 |\n| ![Algeria](image) Algeria |  330,935 |\n| ![Morocco](image) Morocco |  253,518 |\n| ![Portugal](image) Portugal |  234,399 |\n| ![Tunisia](image) Tunisia |  127,827 |\n| ![](image) Guadeloupe |  81,269 |\n| ![](image) Martinique |  75,959 |\n| ![China](image) China |  71,500 |\n| ![Turkey](image) Turkey |  67,982 |\n| ![Mali](image) Mali |  66,085 |\n| ![Ivory Coast](image) Côte d'Ivoire |  63,810 |\n| ![Senegal](image) Senegal |  60,124 |\n| ![Italy](image) Italy |  58,141 |\n| ![Romania](image) Romania |  53,848 |\n| ![Democratic Republic of the Congo](image) Democratic Republic of Congo |  52,449 |\n| ![Spain](image) Spain |  45,828 |\n| ![Sri Lanka](image) Sri Lanka |  45,786 |\n| ![Cameroon](image) Cameroon |  45,370 |\n\n |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  • Metro(2020)\n | 18,940.7 km2 (7,313.0 sq mi) |\n| Population(2023)[2]\n | 2,102,650 |\n|  • Density | 20,000/km2 (52,000/sq mi) |\n|  • Urban(2019[3])\n | 10,858,852 |\n|  • Urban density | 3,800/km2 (9,900/sq mi) |\n|  • Metro(Jan. 2017[4])\n | 13,024,518 |\n|  • Metro density | 690/km2 (1,800/sq mi) |\n| Demonym(s) | Parisian(s) (en) *Parisien(s)* (masc.), *Parisienne(s)* (fem.)

It reached 2.25 million in 2011. In March 2001, Bertrand Delanoë became the first socialist mayor. He was re-elected in March 2008.[82] In 2007, in an effort to reduce car traffic, he introduced the Vélib', a system which rents bicycles. Bertrand Delanoë also transformed a section of the highway along the Left Bank of the Seine into an urban promenade and park, the Promenade des Berges de la Seine, which he inaugurated in June 2013.[83]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nParis is the core of a built-up area that extends well beyond its limits: commonly referred to as the *agglomération Parisienne*, and statistically as a *unité urbaine* (a measure of urban area), the Paris agglomeration's population of 10,785,092 in 2017[161] made it the largest urban area in the European Union.[162] City-influenced commuter activity reaches well beyond even this in a statistical *aire d'attraction* de Paris (\"functional area\", a statistical method comparable to a metropolitan area[163]), that had a population of 13,024,518 in 2017,[164] 19.6% of the population of France,[165] and the largest metropolitan area in the Eurozone.[162]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the Paris Region, 590,504 residents were immigrants from Europe, 627,078 were immigrants from the Maghreb, 435,339 from sub-Saharan Africa and Egypt, 69,338 from Turkey, 322,330 from Asia (outside Turkey), 113,363 from the Americas, and 2,261 from the South Pacific.[168]\n\n\nIn 2012, there were 8,810 British citizens and 10,019 United States citizens living in the City of Paris (Ville de Paris) and 20,466 British citizens and 16,408 United States citizens living in the entire Paris Region (Île-de-France).[169][170]\n\n\nIn 2020–2021, about 6 million people, or 41% of the population of the Paris Region, were either immigrants (21%) or had at least one immigrant parent (20%); these figures do not include French people born in Overseas France and their direct descendants.[171]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Religious buildings in Paris\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSixty-two percent of its buildings date from 1949 and before, 20 percent were built between 1949 and 1974, and only 18 percent of the buildings remaining were built after that date.[139] Two-thirds of the city's 1.3 million residences are studio and two-room apartments. Paris averages 1.9 people per residence, a number that has remained constant since the 1980s, but it is much less than Île-de-France's 2.33 person-per-residence average.

Despite the city being home to less than a fourteenth (1/14) of the population of the metro area, it is an outlier compared to its neighbors, being nearly twice the size of the next-largest city in the metro: Hialeah. The city also has approximately a sixth of the population of its own county, Miami-Dade, which is the state's largest.\n\n\nThe city witnessed rapid growth over the first half of the twentieth century, as its population grew from 1,681 at the time of the 1900 census to 249,276 at the time of the 1950 census. This made it Florida's largest city, a title it would retain until the Jacksonville Consolidation, when the city of Jacksonville absorbed most of Duval County, nearly tripling its population. Since then, Miami has retained its spot as Florida's second-largest city.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Economic indicators\n |\n| --- |\n| 2017–21 American Community Survey | Miami\n | Miami-Dade County\n | Florida\n |\n| Median income[96] | $31,472\n | $32,513\n | $34,367\n |\n| Median household income[97] | $47,860\n | $57,815\n | $61,777\n |\n| Poverty Rate[98] | 20.9%\n | 15.7%\n | 13.1%\n |\n| High school diploma[99] | 79.2%\n | 82.5%\n | 89.0%\n |\n| Bachelor's degree[99] | 33.1%\n | 31.7%\n | 31.5%\n |\n| Advanced degree[99] | 13.2%\n | 11.9%\n | 11.7%\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Language spoken at home[d] | 2015[e] | 2010[f] | 2000[102] | 1990[103] | 1980[104] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| English | 23.0%\n | 22.6%\n | 24.7%\n | 26.7%\n | 36.0%\n |\n| Spanish or Spanish Creole | 70.0%\n | 69.9%\n | 66.6%\n | 64.0%\n | 57.5%\n |\n| French or Haitian Creole | 4.5%\n | 4.9%\n | 6.0%\n | 7.7%\n | 2.6%\n |\n| Other Languages\n | 2.5%\n | 2.6%\n | 2.7%\n | 1.6%\n | 3.9%\n |\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n23. **^** \"Miami Is The Second Most Popular Destination For International Visitors (And Growing Fast)\".

According to INSEE, the population has dropped by 122,919, or about five percent, over the past decade. The Mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, declared that this illustrated the \"de-densification\" of the city, creating more green space and less crowding.[153][154] Despite the drop, Paris remains the most densely-populated city in Europe, with 252 residents per hectare, not counting parks.[155] This drop was attributed partly to a lower birth rate, the departure of middle-class residents and the possible loss of housing in the city due to short-term rentals for tourism.[156]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nParis is the fourth largest municipality in the European Union, following Berlin, Madrid and Rome. Eurostat places Paris (6.5 million people) behind London (8 million) and ahead of Berlin (3.5 million), based on the 2012 populations of what Eurostat calls \"urban audit core cities\".[157]\nThe population of Paris today is lower than its historical peak of 2.9 million in 1921.[158] The principal reasons were a significant decline in household size, and a dramatic migration of residents to the suburbs between 1962 and 1975. Factors in the migration included de-industrialisation, high rent, the gentrification of many inner quarters, the transformation of living space into offices, and greater affluence among working families. The city's population loss came to a temporary halt at the beginning of the 21st century; the population increased from 2,125,246 in 1999 to 2,240,621 in 2012, before declining again slightly in 2017, 2018, and again in 2021.[159][160]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  • Metro(2020)\n | 18,940.7 km2 (7,313.0 sq mi) |\n| Population(2023)[2]\n | 2,102,650 |\n|  • Density | 20,000/km2 (52,000/sq mi) |\n|  • Urban(2019[3])\n | 10,858,852 |\n|  • Urban density | 3,800/km2 (9,900/sq mi) |\n|  • Metro(Jan. 2017[4])\n | 13,024,518 |\n|  • Metro density | 690/km2 (1,800/sq mi) |\n| Demonym(s) | Parisian(s) (en) *Parisien(s)* (masc.), *Parisienne(s)* (fem.)

With an official estimated population of 2,102,650 residents as of 1 January 2023[2] in an area of more than 105 km2 (41 sq mi),[5] Paris is the fifth-most populated city in the European Union and the 30th most densely populated city in the world in 2022.[6] Since the 17th century, Paris has been one of the world's major centres of finance, diplomacy, commerce, culture, fashion, gastronomy and many areas. For its leading role in the arts and sciences, as well as its early and extensive system of street lighting, in the 19th century, it became known as the City of Light.[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nParis is the core of a built-up area that extends well beyond its limits: commonly referred to as the *agglomération Parisienne*, and statistically as a *unité urbaine* (a measure of urban area), the Paris agglomeration's population of 10,785,092 in 2017[161] made it the largest urban area in the European Union.[162] City-influenced commuter activity reaches well beyond even this in a statistical *aire d'attraction* de Paris (\"functional area\", a statistical method comparable to a metropolitan area[163]), that had a population of 13,024,518 in 2017,[164] 19.6% of the population of France,[165] and the largest metropolitan area in the Eurozone.[162]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSixty-two percent of its buildings date from 1949 and before, 20 percent were built between 1949 and 1974, and only 18 percent of the buildings remaining were built after that date.[139] Two-thirds of the city's 1.3 million residences are studio and two-room apartments. Paris averages 1.9 people per residence, a number that has remained constant since the 1980s, but it is much less than Île-de-France's 2.33 person-per-residence average. Only 33 percent of principal residence Parisians own their habitation (against 47 percent for the entire Île-de-France): the major part of the city's population is a rent-paying one.[139] Social or public housing represented 19.9 percent of the city's total residences in 2017. Its distribution varies widely throughout the city, from 2.6 percent of the housing in the wealthy 7th arrondissement, to 39.9 percent in the 19th arrondissement.[140]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Répertoire national des élus: les maires\" (in French). data.gouv.fr, Plateforme ouverte des données publiques françaises. 16 December 2022.
