The group began their musical career as **Girl's Tyme**, formed in 1990 in Houston, Texas.[1] After years of limited success, the original quartet comprising Knowles, Rowland, LaTavia Roberson, and LeToya Luckett were signed in 1997 to Columbia Records as Destiny's Child. The group was launched into mainstream recognition following the release of the song \"No, No, No\" and their best-selling second album, *The Writing's on the Wall* (1999), which contained the number-one singles \"Bills, Bills, Bills\" and \"Say My Name\". Despite critical and commercial success, the group was plagued by internal conflict and legal turmoil, as Roberson and Luckett attempted to split from the group's manager Mathew Knowles, citing favoritism of Knowles and Rowland.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The final line-up of Destiny's Child performing during their 2005 Destiny Fulfilled... and Lovin' It concert tour.\nTo promote the album, Destiny's Child embarked on their worldwide concert tour, Destiny Fulfilled... and Lovin' It Tour.
