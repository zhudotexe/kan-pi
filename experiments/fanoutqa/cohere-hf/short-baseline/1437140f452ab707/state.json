The only exemption being if the individual is being released following a first or second degree felony conviction and federal officials obtain a warrant from a judge[37][38] - effectively making Philadelphia a sanctuary city.[39][40] Nutter indicated that the change in policy supports public safety and will help rebuild the trust between police and the immigrant community.[38] The executive order was highlighted in June 2014 after a previously deported undocumented immigrant from Honduras was accused of raping a woman in Rittenhouse Square with the concern that if acquitted, the accused would not be submitted for deportation due to Philadelphia's new policy.[41][42][43]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of mayors of the largest 50 US cities\n* History of African Americans in Philadelphia\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNutter has supported the eviction of the Cradle of Liberty Council of the Boy Scouts of America from their headquarters on the Benjamin Franklin Parkway, both as a councilman and as mayor.

Registered Democrats hold a formidable 7-to-1 ratio over registered Republicans in Philadelphia, giving Democratic candidates a distinct advantage in citywide elections. The mayoral primary elections were held on May 19, 2015. Kenney won the primary in a landslide with 55.83% of the vote, defeating a crowded field of five other Democratic candidates, including Anthony H. Williams and former District Attorney Lynn Abraham. Republican Melissa Murray Bailey, a business executive, ran unopposed for the Republican nomination. Kenney won with 85.1% of the vote.[12] Kenney was inaugurated as the 99th Mayor of Philadelphia on January 4, 2016.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nMayors of Philadelphia (chronologically)\n |\n| --- |\n| Colonial era(1691\u20131776) | * Morrey\n* Shippen (I)\n* Morris (I)\n* G.
