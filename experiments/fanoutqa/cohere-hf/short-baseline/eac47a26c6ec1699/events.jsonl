Between the Revolution and the American Civil War, it was a private institution, but it suffered significant damage during the Civil War and began to receive public support in the 1880s. William & Mary officially became a public college in 1906.\n\n\nRutgers was founded in 1766 as Queen's College, named for Queen Charlotte, and was for much of its history privately affiliated with the Dutch Reformed Church. It changed its name to Rutgers College in 1825 and was designated as the State University of New Jersey after World War II.\n\n\n\n\n## The nine colonial colleges\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Image\n | Colonial college  (*present name, if different*)\n | Colony\n | Founded\n | Chartered\n | First instruction (degrees)\n | Primary religious influence\n | Ivy League\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | **New College**[nb 1](*Harvard University*)\n | Massachusetts Bay Colony | 1636\n | 1650[3] | 1642 (1642)\n | Puritan (Congregational) | Yes\n |\n| ![](image) | **College of William & Mary** | Colony of Virginia | 1693[nb 2] | 1693[6] | 1694[7] | Church of England[nb 3](Episcopalian)\n | No\n |\n| ![](image) | **Collegiate School**(*Yale University*)\n | Connecticut Colony | 1701\n | 1701[8] | 1702 (1702 honorary MA) (1703 BA)[9] | Puritan (Congregational)\n | Yes\n |\n| ![](image) | **College of New Jersey**(*Princeton University*)\n | Province of New Jersey | 1746\n | 1746[10] | 1747 (1748)\n | Presbyterian but officially nonsectarian\n | Yes\n |\n| ![](image) | **King's College**(*Columbia University*)\n | Province of New York | 1754\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSeveral other colleges and universities can be traced to colonial-era \"academies\" or \"schools\", but are not considered colonial colleges because they were not formally chartered as colleges with degree-granting powers until after the formation of the United States in 1776.
