CCP. It is one of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council and a founding member of several multilateral and regional organizations such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the Silk Road Fund, the New Development Bank, and the RCEP. It is also a member of the BRICS, the G20, APEC, and the East Asia Summit. China ranks poorly in measures of democracy, transparency, and human rights, including for press freedom, religious freedom, and ethnic equality. Making up around one-fifth of the world economy, China is the world's largest economy by GDP at purchasing power parity, the second-largest economy by nominal GDP, and the second-wealthiest country. The country is one of the fastest-growing major economies and is the world's largest manufacturer and exporter, as well as the second-largest importer. China is a nuclear-weapon state with the world's largest standing army by military personnel and the second-largest defense budget.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n### Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Administrative divisions of China, Districts of Hong Kong, and Municipalities and parishes of Macau\n\nThe PRC is constitutionally a unitary state officially divided into 23 provinces,[x] five autonomous regions (each with a designated minority group), and four directly administered municipalities\u2014collectively referred to as \"mainland China\"\u2014as well as the special administrative regions (SARs) of Hong Kong and Macau.[219] The PRC considers Taiwan to be its 23rd province,[220] although it is governed by the Republic of China (ROC), which claims to be the legitimate representative of China and its territory, though it has downplayed this claim since its democratization.[221] Geographically, all 31 provincial divisions of mainland China can be grouped into six regions: North China, Northeast China, East China, South Central China, Southwest China, and Northwest China.[222]\n\n\n\n![](image)\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe PRC officially terms itself as a democracy, using terms such as \"socialist consultative democracy\",[202] and \"whole-process people's democracy\".[203] However, the country is commonly described as an authoritarian one-party state and a dictatorship,[204][205] with among the heaviest restrictions worldwide in many areas, most notably against freedom of the press, freedom of assembly, reproductive rights, free formation of social organizations, freedom of religion and free access to the Internet.[206] China has consistently been ranked amongst the lowest as an \"authoritarian regime\" by the Economist Intelligence Unit's Democracy Index, ranking at 156th out of 167 countries in 2022.[207]\n\n\n\n### Chinese Communist Party[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Chinese Communist Party\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**China** (Chinese: \u4e2d\u56fd; pinyin: *Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3*), officially the **People's Republic of China** (**PRC**),[k] is a country in East Asia.

China spans the equivalent of five time zones and borders fourteen countries by land,[l] tied with Russia as having the most of any country in the world. With an area of nearly 9.6\u00a0million square kilometers (3,700,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), it is the world's third-largest country by total land area.[m] The country is divided into 22 provinces,[n] five autonomous regions, four municipalities, and two semi-autonomous special administrative regions.

The country's head of government is the prime minister, who holds office by virtue of their ability to command the confidence of the elected House of Commons and is \"called upon\" by the governor general, representing the monarch of Canada, the head of state. The country is a Commonwealth realm and is officially bilingual (English and French) in the federal jurisdiction. It is very highly ranked in international measurements of government transparency, quality of life, economic competitiveness, innovation, education and gender equality. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration. Canada's long and complex relationship with the United States has had a significant impact on its history, economy, and culture.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Contents | * Index\n* Outline\n*

Provincial legislatures are unicameral and operate in parliamentary fashion similar to the House of Commons.[196] Canada's three territories also have legislatures; but, these are not sovereign and have fewer constitutional responsibilities than the provinces.[205] The territorial legislatures also differ structurally from their provincial counterparts.[206]\n\n\nThe Bank of Canada is the central bank of the country.[207] The minister of finance and minister of innovation, science, and industry use the Statistics Canada agency for financial planning and economic policy development.[208] The Bank of Canada is the sole authority authorized to issue currency in the form of Canadian bank notes.[209] The bank does not issue Canadian coins; they are issued by the Royal Canadian Mint.[210]\n\n\n\n### Law[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Law of Canada\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Denmark | * Greenland\n |\n| France | * Clipperton Island\n* St. Barth\u00e9lemy\n* St. Martin\n* St. Pierre and Miquelon\n |\n| Netherlands | * Aruba\n* Cura\u00e7ao\n* Sint Maarten\n |\n| United Kingdom | * Anguilla\n* Bermuda\n* British Virgin Islands\n* Cayman Islands\n* Montserrat\n* Turks and Caicos Islands\n |\n| United States | * Puerto Rico\n* United States Virgin Islands\n |\n| **![map](image) North America portal**\n |\n\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n187. **^** Geddes, John (February 8, 2022). \"What's actually standing in the way of right-wing populism in Canada?\". *Macleans.ca*.\n188. **^** Dowding, Keith; Dumont, Patrick (2014). *The Selection of Ministers around the World*.

Its border with the United States is the world's longest international land border. The country is characterized by a wide range of both meteorologic and geological regions. It is a sparsely inhabited country of 40\u00a0million people, the vast majority residing south of the 55th parallel in urban areas.

In turn, these may be grouped into four main regions: Western Canada, Central Canada, Atlantic Canada, and Northern Canada (*Eastern Canada* refers to Central Canada and Atlantic Canada together).[261] Provinces and territories have responsibility for social programs such as healthcare, education, and welfare,[262] as well as administration of justice (but not criminal law). Together, the provinces collect more revenue than the federal government, a rarity among other federations in the world. Using its spending powers, the federal government can initiate national policies in provincial areas such as health and child care; the provinces can opt out of these cost-share programs but rarely do so in practice. Equalization payments are made by the federal government to ensure reasonably uniform standards of services and taxation are kept between the richer and poorer provinces.[263]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n277. **^** \"Corruption Perceptions Index (latest)\".

The powers flowing from the *Constitution Act, 1867*, are divided between the federal government and the provincial governments to exercise exclusively[267] and any changes to that arrangement require a constitutional amendment, while changes to the roles and powers of the territories may be performed unilaterally by the Parliament of Canada.[268]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of Canada\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n406. **^** Epstein, Irving (2008). *The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Children's Issues Worldwide*.

Nevertheless, in the performance of official duties, the monarch has \"the right to be consulted, the right to encourage, and the right to warn\".[170] In addition, the monarch has a number of reserve powers at his disposal, albeit rarely used, to uphold responsible government and prevent constitutional crises.[q]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * Constitution\n* Corruption\n* Devolution\n* Elections\n\t+ By-elections\n* Foreign relations\n* Human rights\n\t+ LGBT\n* Judiciary\n* Law\n* Law enforcement\n* Local government\n* Monarchy\n\t+ monarchs\n\t+ republicanism\n* Nationality\n* Parliament\n\t+ House of Commons\n\t+ House of Lords\n* Political parties\n* Female party leaders\n* Political scandals\n* Shadow Cabinet\n |\n| Government | * Cabinet\n\t+ list\n* Civil service\n* Departments\n* Ministers\n\t+ list\n* Prime Minister\n\t+ list\n |\n| Military | * His Majesty's Naval Service\n* British Army\n* Royal Air Force\n* Weapons of mass destruction\n |\n\n |\n\n |\n| Economy | \n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * Banks\n\t+ Bank of England\n* Budget\n* Economic geography\n* Free trade agreements\n* Income\n* Manufacturing\n* Pound sterling (currency)\n* Science and technology\n* Stock exchanges (London Exchange)\n* Taxation\n* Telecommunications\n* Tourism\n |\n| Transport | * Air transport\n* Bus transport\n* Driving\n* Roads\n* Rail transport\n |\n\n |\n| Society | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * **Countries and territories where English is an official language, but not the majority first language**\n |\n| Africa | * Botswana\n* Cameroon\n* Eswatini\n* The Gambia\n* Ghana\n* Kenya\n* Lesotho\n* Liberia\n* Malawi\n* Mauritius\n* Namibia\n* Nigeria\n* Rwanda\n* Sierra Leone\n* Somaliland\n* South Africa\n* South Sudan\n* Sudan\n* Tanzania\n* Uganda\n* Zambia\n* Zimbabwe\n |\n| Americas | * *Puerto Rico*\n |\n| Asia | * *Christmas Island*\n* *Cocos (Keeling) Islands*\n* *Hong Kong*\n* India\n* Pakistan\n* Philippines\n* Singapore\n |\n| Europe | * *Gibraltar*\n* *Akrotiri and Dhekelia*\n* Malta\n |\n| Oceania | * *American Samoa*\n* Cook Islands\n* Fiji\n* *Guam*\n* Kiribati\n* Marshall Islands\n* Micronesia\n* Nauru\n* Niue\n* *Northern Mariana Islands*\n* Palau\n* Papua New Guinea\n* Samoa\n* Solomon Islands\n* *Tokelau*\n* Tuvalu\n* Vanuatu\n |\n\n |\n\n |\n| Dependencies shown in *italics*.\n |\n\n |\n\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n11. **^** Usage is mixed.

Other major cities include Birmingham, Manchester, Glasgow, and Leeds.[26] The UK consists of three distinct legal jurisdictions: England and Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. This is due to these areas retaining their existing legal systems even after joining the UK.[27] Since 1998, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland also have their own devolved governments and legislatures, each with varying powers.[28]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n6. **^** Some of the devolved countries, Crown Dependencies and British Overseas Territories issue their own sterling banknotes or currencies, or use another nation's currency.

A series of Jacobite uprisings sought to remove the Protestant House of Hanover from the throne and restore the Catholic House of Stuart. The Jacobites were finally defeated at the Battle of Culloden in 1746, after which the Scottish Highlanders were forcibly assimilated into Scotland by revoking the feudal independence of clan chiefs. The British colonies in North America that broke away in the American War of Independence became the United States, recognised by Britain in 1783. British imperial ambition turned towards Asia, particularly to India.[72]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Crown Dependencies are possessions of the Crown, as opposed to territories of the UK.[222] They comprise three independently administered jurisdictions: the Bailiwicks of Jersey and of Guernsey in the English Channel, and the Isle of Man in the Irish Sea. By mutual agreement, the British Government manages the islands' foreign affairs and defence and the UK Parliament has the authority to legislate on their behalf. Internationally, they are regarded as \"territories for which the United Kingdom is responsible\".[223] The power to pass legislation affecting the islands ultimately rests with their own respective legislative assemblies, with the assent of the Crown (Privy Council or, in the case of the Isle of Man, in certain circumstances the Lieutenant-Governor).[224] Since 2005, each Crown dependency has had a Chief Minister as its head of government.[225]\n\n\n\n### Law and criminal justice[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Law of the United Kingdom, Censorship in the United Kingdom, and Crime in the United Kingdom\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Country\n | Population | Total area\n | Capital | Parliament | First Minister\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\u00a0England | 56,489,800 (2021) | 130,279\u00a0km2 (50,301\u00a0sq\u00a0mi)\n | London | none\n | none\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Scotland | 5,436,600 (2022) | 77,933\u00a0km2 (30,090.1\u00a0sq\u00a0mi)\n | Edinburgh | Scottish Parliament | Humza Yousaf |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Wales | 3,267,501 (2022) | 20,779\u00a0km2 (8,022.82\u00a0sq\u00a0mi)\n | Cardiff | Senedd | Mark Drakeford |\n| Northern Ireland | 1,903,100 (2021) | 14,130\u00a0km2 (5,455.62\u00a0sq\u00a0mi)\n | Belfast | Northern Ireland Assembly | vacant\n |\n\n\n#### Scotland[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Scottish Parliament, Scottish Government, and Local government in Scotland\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * Akrotiri and Dhekelia2 (Sovereign Base Areas)\n* Gibraltar (British Overseas Territory)\n |\n| Crown Dependencies | * Bailiwick of Guernsey\n\t+ Alderney\n\t+ Guernsey\n\t+ Sark\n* Bailiwick of Jersey\n* Isle of Man\n |\n\n |\n\n |\n| Special areasof internalsovereignty\n | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Finland | * \u00c5land (autonomous region subject to the \u00c5land convention of 1921)\n |\n| Norway | * Svalbard (unincorporated area subject to the Svalbard Treaty)\n |\n| United Kingdom | * England\n* Scotland\n* Wales\n* Northern Ireland (country of the United Kingdom subject to the British-Irish Agreement)\n |\n\n |\n| * 1 Spans the conventional boundary between Europe and another continent.\n* 2 Considered European for cultural, political and historical reasons but is geographically in Western Asia.\n* 3 Oceanic islands within the vicinity of Europe are usually grouped with the continent even though they are not situated on its continental shelf.\n* 4 Governed by the Holy See which has sovereignty over Vatican City.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| England | * History\n\t+ social\n\t+ timeline\n* Geography\n* Politics\n* Law\n* Economy\n\t+ tourism\n* Education\n* Health care\n* Homelessness\n* Culture\n* Religion\n* Symbols\n |\n| Northern Ireland | * History\n* Geography\n* Politics\n\t+ Assembly\n\t+ Executive\n\t+ First Minister and deputy\n* Law\n* Economy\n\t+ tourism\n* Education\n* Health care\n* Culture\n* Religion\n* Symbols\n |\n| Scotland | * History\n\t+ timeline\n* Geography\n* Politics\n\t+ Parliament\n\t+ Government\n\t+ First Minister\n* Law\n* Economy\n\t+ tourism\n* Education\n* Health care\n* Homelessness\n* Culture\n* Religion\n* Symbols\n |\n| Wales | * History\n* Geography\n* Politics\n\t+ Senedd\n\t+ Government\n\t+ First Minister\n* Law\n* Economy\n\t+ tourism\n* Education\n* Health care\n* Culture\n* Religion\n* Symbols\n |\n\n |\n\n |\n\n |\n| * Outline\n* Index\n\n* Category\n* Portal\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n133. **^** \"Oxford University/AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine approved\". *UK Government*.

The British constitution would develop on the basis of constitutional monarchy and the parliamentary system.[69] With the founding of the Royal Society in 1660, science was greatly encouraged. During this period, particularly in England, the development of naval power and the interest in voyages of discovery led to the acquisition and settlement of overseas colonies, particularly in North America and the Caribbean.[70]\n\n\nThough previous attempts at uniting the two kingdoms within Great Britain in 1606, 1667, and 1689 had proved unsuccessful, the attempt initiated in 1705 led to the Treaty of Union of 1706 being agreed and ratified by both parliaments.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n386. **^** \"How does UK healthcare spending compare with other countries?\".

It is therefore by and through the monarch that Parliament exercises supreme legislative authority over both the executive and judiciary. Distinguished Professor of Public Law Maurice Sunkin opined the Crown symbolically occupies \"\u2026what in other places would be a core element of a written constitution.\"[163] As a result of this state of constitutional affairs, the monarch is formally referred to as \"the Sovereign\" in legislation.[164]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)University of Oxford is widely regarded as one of the world's leading universities.\nEducation in the United Kingdom is a devolved matter, with each country having a separate education system. About 38 per cent of the United Kingdom population has a university or college degree, which is the highest percentage in Europe, and among the highest percentages in the world.[377] The United Kingdom is home to many universities, including the University of Oxford and University of Cambridge which often achieve first place on global rankings.[378][379]\n\n\nIn 2018, the Programme for International Student Assessment, coordinated by the OECD, ranked the overall knowledge and skills of British 15-year-olds as 13th in the world in reading, literacy, mathematics, and science.

Australia's population of nearly 27 million[11] is highly urbanised and heavily concentrated on the eastern seaboard.[30] Canberra is the nation's capital, while its most populous cities are Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide.[31] It is ethnically diverse and multicultural, the product of large-scale immigration, with almost half of the population having at least one parent born overseas.[32] Australia's abundant natural resources and well-developed international trade relations are crucial to the country's economy, which generates its income from various sources including services, mining exports, banking, manufacturing, agriculture and international education.[33][34][35] Australia ranks highly for quality of life, health, education, economic freedom, civil liberties and political rights.[36]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAustralia is a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy.[216] The country has maintained a stable liberal democratic political system under its constitution, which is one of the world's oldest, since Federation in 1901. It is also one of the world's oldest federations, in which power is divided between the federal and state and territorial governments. The Australian system of government combines elements derived from the political systems of the United Kingdom (a fused executive, constitutional monarchy and strong party discipline) and the United States (federalism, a written constitution and strong bicameralism with an elected upper house), along with distinctive indigenous features.[217][218]\n\n\nThe federal government is separated into three branches:[219]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Articles | * English-speaking world\n* History of the English language\n* British Empire\n* English in the Commonwealth of Nations\n* Anglosphere\n |\n| Lists | * List of countries by English-speaking population\n* List of countries where English is an official language\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \u00a0 | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Entire | * Australia\n* Fiji\n* Kiribati\n* Marshall Islands\n* Micronesia\n* Nauru\n* New Zealand\n* Palau\n* Papua New Guinea\n* Samoa\n* Solomon Islands\n* Tonga\n* Tuvalu\n* Vanuatu\n |\n| In part | * Chile\n\t+ Easter Island\n\t+ Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands\n* Ecuador\n\t+ Gal\u00e1pagos Islands\n* Indonesia\n\t+ Central Papua\n\t+ Highland Papua\n\t+ Papua\n\t+ South Papua\n\t+ Southwest Papua\n\t+ West Papua\n* Japan\n\t+ Dait\u014d Islands\n\t+ Nanp\u014d Islands\n* United States\n\t+ Hawaii\n\t+ Palmyra Atoll\n |\n\n | ![](image)\n |\n| Associated states\n | * Cook Islands\n* Niue\n |\n| Dependencies andother territories\n | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * Asylum\n* Constitution\n* Courts\n* Elections\n\t+ Donations\n\t+ Electoral system\n\t+ Parties\n* Federal budget\n* Foreign relations\n* Government\n* Governor-General\n* Human rights\n\t+ Intersex\n\t+ LGBT\n\t+ Transgender\n* Intelligence and security\n* Law\n\t+ Constitution\n\t+ Judiciary\n\t+ Enforcement\n* Military\n* Monarchy\n* National debt\n* Parliament\n* Political ideology\n\t+ Anarchism\n\t+ Christian\n\t+ Conservatism\n\t+ Far-right\n\t+ Liberalism\n\t+ Nationalism\n\t+ Republicanism\n\t+ Socialism\n* Public Service\n* Women\n\t+ Government leaders\n\t+ Government ministers\n* Shadow Cabinet\n |\n\n |\n| Economy | \n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * Agriculture\n* Dollar\n* Energy\n* Gross state product\n* Home ownership\n\t+ Public housing\n* Household income\n* Manufacturing\n* Media\n* Mining\n* Poverty\n* Reserve Bank\n* Stock exchange\n* Superannuation\n* Taxation\n* Telecommunications\n* Tourism\n* Transport\n* Welfare system\n |\n\n |\n| Society | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAustralia maintains a deeply integrated relationship with neighbouring New Zealand, with free mobility of citizens between the two countries under the Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement and free trade under the Closer Economic Relations agreement.[254] The most favourably viewed countries by the Australian people in 2021 include New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Japan, Germany, Taiwan, Thailand, the United States and South Korea.[255] A founding member country of the United Nations, Australia is strongly committed to multilateralism,[256] and maintains an international aid program under which some 60 countries receive assistance.[257] Australia ranked fourth in the Center for Global Development's 2021 Commitment to Development Index.[258]\n\n\n\n### Military[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Australian Defence Force, Royal Australian Navy, Australian Army, and Royal Australian Air Force\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * Abortion\n* Aged care\n* Censorship\n* Citizenship\n* Crime\n* Education\n* Euthanasia\n* Healthcare\n* Homelessness\n* Human trafficking\n* Immigration\n* Irreligion\n* Languages\n* Life expectancy\n* People\n\t+ Demographics\n\t+ Ethnic groups\n\t+ Indigenous Australians\n* Prostitution\n* Racism\n* Religion\n* Squatting\n* Waste management\n* Women\n |\n| Culture | * Architecture\n* Art\n* Arts\n* Australian English\n* Cinema\n* Cuisine\n* Dance\n* Literature\n* Music\n* Public holidays\n* Radio\n* Sport\n* Symbols\n* Television\n* Theatre\n* Anglosphere\n* Australian studies\n |\n\n |\n| * Outline\n* Index\n* Bibliography\n\n* Category\n* Portal\n |\n\n| Articles related to Australia\n |\n| --- |\n| | * v\n* t\n* e\nCountries and territories of Oceania\n |\n| --- |\n| * List of Oceanian countries by area\n* List of Oceanian countries by population\n |\n| Sovereign states | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n2 Rhodesia unilaterally declared independence in 1965, but this was not recognised internationally.

As in most other parliamentary democracies, the term \"Government\" refers chiefly to the executive branch, and more specifically to the collective ministry directing the executive.[11] Based on the principle of responsible government, it operates within the framework that \"the [King] reigns, but the government rules, so long as it has the support of the House of Representatives\".[12] The *Cabinet Manual* describes the main laws, rules and conventions affecting the conduct and operation of the Government.\n\n\nExecutive power is exercised by ministers, all of whom are sworn into the Executive Council and accountable to the elected legislature, the House of Representatives.[13] Several senior ministers (usually 20) constitute a collective decision-making body known as the Cabinet, which is led by the prime minister (currently Chris Hipkins).[14] A few more ministers (usually junior or supporting) are part of the Executive Council but are outside Cabinet. Most ministers have a portfolio of specific responsibilities such as departments or policy areas, although ministers without portfolio can be appointed.\n\n\nThe position of prime minister belongs to the person who commands the confidence of the majority of members in the House of Representatives. The position is determined also by several other factors, such as support agreements between parties and internal leadership votes in the party that leads the Government. The prime minister and other ministers are formally appointed by the governor-general (who is the King's personal representative in New Zealand).[13] By convention, the governor-general acts on the advice of the prime minister in appointing ministers.\n\n\n\n\n## Terminology\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)The Beehive, Wellington, is the seat of government (i.e. headquarters of the executive branch)\nIn New Zealand, the term *Government* can have a number of different meanings. At its widest, it can refer collectively to the three traditional branches of government\u2014namely, the executive branch, legislative branch (the King-in-Parliament and House of Representatives) and judicial branch (the Supreme Court and subordinate courts).[15] Each branch operates independently of the others in an arrangement described as \"separation of powers\".[16]\n\n\nMore commonly, the term is used to refer specifically to the executive branch.[16] The largest party or coalition in the House of Representatives, with a sufficient number of MPs to win crucial parliamentary votes, will form a Cabinet\u2014this is the sense intended when it is said that a political party \"forms the government\".[17][18] The Constitution Act 1986, the principal part of New Zealand's constitution, locates the executive government in the Executive Council,[13] which also includes ministers outside Cabinet.[19]\n\n\nThe Executive Wing of Parliament Buildings, commonly called the \"Beehive\" because of the building's shape, houses many government offices and is also where the Cabinet meets.[20] Thus the name *Beehive* is sometimes used metonymically to refer to the New Zealand Government.[21]\nThe official website of the New Zealand Government uses the web address `beehive.govt.nz`.[22]\n\n\n\n## History\n\n[edit]\n\nNew Zealand was granted colonial self-government in 1853 following the New Zealand Constitution Act 1852, which was an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Governments were set up at both central and provincial level, with initially six provinces.[23] The provinces were abolished by the Abolition of Provinces Act 1876, during the premiership of Harry Atkinson. For the purposes of the law, the provinces formally ceased to exist on 1 January 1877.[24]\n\n\nThe Sewell Ministry constituted the first responsible government, with control over all domestic matters other than native policy.[23] Formed in 1856, it lasted from 18 April to 20 May. From 7 May onward, Henry Sewell was titled \"colonial secretary\", and is generally regarded as having been the country's first prime minister.[25] The first ministry that formed along party lines did not appear until 1891, when John Ballance formed the Liberal Party and the Liberal Government.[26][27] The prime minister became the leader and public face of the governing party.[28] The status of the monarch's representative was upgraded from \"governor\" to \"governor-general\" in 1917 letters patent.[23][29]\n\n\n\n## Government and the Crown\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: Monarchy of New Zealand and The Crown\n\n![](image)Elizabeth II and her New Zealand Cabinet, photographed during the Queen's 1981 tour of the country\nThe New Zealand Government is formally styled *[His] Majesty's Government* in the Seal of New Zealand Act 1977.[30] This is a reference to the monarch, currently King Charles III, who is identified as the head of state in the Constitution Act 1986.[13] The legal authority of the state that is vested in the monarch, known as \"the Crown\", remains the source of the executive power exercised by the Government.[16][31] Sovereignty in New Zealand has never rested solely with the monarch due to the English Bill of Rights 1689, later inherited by New Zealand, which establishes the principle of parliamentary sovereignty.[32] Nonetheless, the Constitution Act describes the monarch as the \"Sovereign\".[13]\n\n\nIn many areas the Crown possesses a body of powers known as the royal prerogative.[33][34] For example, the Royal Assent (the monarch's approval)[35] is required to enact laws and the royal sign-manual gives authority to letters patent and orders in council.[36][37] The royal prerogative also includes summoning and dissolving the Parliament in order to call an election,[38] and extends to foreign affairs: the negotiation and ratification of treaties, alliances, international agreements, the right to declare war and peace, and the deployment and armament of defence forces.[39][40]\n\n\nThe King rarely personally exercises his executive powers; since the sovereign does not normally reside in New Zealand, he appoints a governor-general to represent him and exercise most of his powers.[41] The person who fills this role is selected on the advice of the prime minister and other ministers.[41] \"Advice\" in this sense is a choice generally without options since it would be highly unconventional for the prime minister's advice to be overlooked\u2014a convention that protects the monarchy. As long as the monarch is following the advice of his ministers, he is not held personally responsible for the decisions of the Government. The governor-general has no official term limit, and is said to serve \"at His Majesty's pleasure\".[42]\n\n\nAs per the conventional stipulations of constitutional monarchy, the King and his representative rarely intervene directly in political affairs.[41] Just as the sovereign's choice of governor-general is on the prime minister's advice, the governor-general exercises the executive powers of state on the advice of ministers.[13] For example, the governor-general's power to withhold the Royal Assent to Bills has been rendered ineffective by convention.[38]\n\n\n\n## Government in Parliament\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Chart showing the relationship between the executive Government and the Parliament. All ministers are MPs.\nUnder the conventions of the Westminster system, the Government is accountable to the House of Representatives, the democratically elected component of Parliament, rather than to the sovereign. This is called responsible government.[15][16] For example, ministers are required to be members of the House, and they make statements and take questions from other members in the House.[43] The Government is required by convention and for practical reasons to maintain the support, or confidence, of the House of Representatives. It also requires the support of the House for the maintenance of supply (by voting through the government's budgets) and in order to pass primary legislation.[44][45] By convention, if a government loses the confidence of the House then it must either resign or call for a general election.[16][46] Not since 1928 has a government been defeated on a confidence vote and therefore been obliged to resign.[47]\n\n\nAs the Constitution Act 1986 requires general elections every three years, this is the maximum period of time that a government can serve without its mandate being renewed.[48] Upon the dissolution of Parliament (preceding a general election) ministers are no longer members of the House of Representatives; however, they can remain members of the Executive Council \"until the expiration of the 28th day after the day on which that person ceases to be a member of Parliament\".[13]\n\n\n\n## Ministers\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Ministers in the New Zealand Government\n\nAlso known as \"ministers of the Crown\", these are members of Parliament who hold ministerial warrants from the Crown to perform certain functions of government. This includes formulating and implementing policies and advising the governor-general.[49] Before 1996 nearly all ministers were members of the Cabinet, but since the introduction of proportional representation, which has led to complex governing arrangements, there are currently three categories of minister: ministers in Cabinet, ministers outside Cabinet, and ministers from supporting parties.[50]\n\n\n\n### Executive Council\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Executive Council of New Zealand\n\n![](image)The ministers of the Sixth Labour Government, with Governor-General Dame Patsy Reddy, 6 November 2020\nThe Executive Council, established under the Letters Patent 1983, is a formal body that meets to give legal effect to decisions made by the Cabinet, and to carry out various other functions, such as the making of certain appointments to government agencies and boards. The Executive Council's primary function is to issue Orders in Council, which are legally binding regulations made by the Government.[42][51]\n\n\nAll ministers are members of the Executive Council and are entitled to be styled \"The Honourable\" for life,[52] except for the prime minister, who is styled \"The Right Honourable\", a privilege they retain for life.[53] Although not a member of the Executive Council, the governor-general usually presides at Council meetings.[54]\n\n\n\n### Cabinet\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Cabinet of New Zealand\n\nCabinet (Template:Lang-mi) is the senior decision-making body of the Government.[55][56] Constitutional law, such as the Constitution Act 1986, does not recognise the Cabinet as a legal entity; it exists solely by constitutional convention.[57][58] Its decisions do not in and of themselves have legal force; however, it serves as the practical expression of the Executive Council, which is New Zealand's highest formal governmental body.[49]\n\n\nThe prime minister is responsible for chairing meetings of Cabinet.[28] The governor-general will appoint as prime minister the person most likely to receive the confidence of the House of Representatives to lead the Government. In practice, the appointment is determined by size of each political party, support agreements between parties, and leadership votes in the party that leads the Government.[28][59] The prime minister then advises the governor-general to appoint other ministers. Each minister is responsible for the general administration of at least one portfolio, and heads a corresponding public service department (see \u00a7\u00a0Departments).[56][60] The most important minister, following the prime minister, is the finance minister, while other high-profile portfolios include foreign affairs, justice, health and education.\n\n\nTraditionally, all members are collectively responsible for the actions taken by Cabinet\u2014typically all Cabinet ministers must publicly support the decisions of Cabinet.[61] However, since the introduction of the mixed-member proportional (MMP) electoral system in 1993,[62] processes were developed to allow different parties within a coalition cabinet to \"agree to disagree\" on some issues.[63]\n\n\nThe legislative agenda of Parliament is determined by the Cabinet. At the start of each new parliamentary term, the governor-general gives an address prepared by the Cabinet that outlines the Government's policy and legislative proposals.[64]\n\n\n\n### Ministers outside Cabinet\n\n[edit]\n\nA few other ministers serve in the Executive Council but outside of Cabinet. Since the introduction of MMP, governments have been formed following agreements between a major party and smaller support parties. In such arrangements, government ministers from the support parties are often ministers outside Cabinet.[63] Non-Cabinet ministers may also be from the major governing party, as has been the case in the current government.[65] Ministers outside the Cabinet have the same overall duties and responsibilities as their senior colleagues inside Cabinet.[56][14]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Departments and other public sector organisations\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: Public sector organisations in New Zealand\n\nNew Zealand's public service includes 32 core government institutions\u2014most have *ministry* or *department* in their name, e.g. Ministry for Culture and Heritage, or Department of Internal Affairs\u2014which are listed in the first schedule to the State Sector Act 1988.[66][6] Staffed by around 45,000 public servants,[67] they provide the government of the day with advice and deliver services to the public. Since the 1980s, the public service has been marketised.[68] Each department is headed by a chief executive who answers to a government minister for that department's performance. In turn, a minister bears the ultimate responsibility for the actions of their department, being answerable to the House of Representatives.[6] This principle is called individual ministerial responsibility.[50]\n\n\nThe wider state sector[66] also includes about 2,800 Crown entities (including some 2,600 school boards of trustees and 20 district health boards), 17 state-owned enterprises, three officers of Parliament, and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand.[69]\n\n\n\n## Relationship with local government\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Local government in New Zealand\n\nThere are two main tiers of elected local authorities\u2014regional councils and territorial authorities\u2014in some places merged into unitary authorities. While the central government deals with issues relevant to New Zealand and its people as a nation, local government exists \"to enable democratic local decision-making and action by, and on behalf of, communities\", and \"to meet the current and future needs of communities for good-quality local infrastructure, local public services, and performance of regulatory functions in a way that is most cost-effective for households and businesses.\"[70]\n\n\n\n## List of successive governments\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: List of New Zealand governments\n\nThere have been three distinctly different periods of New Zealand government\u2014firstly, the period before responsible government; second, from 1856 to 1890, the period in which responsible government begins; and the third period starting with the formation of political parties in 1891.[71]\n\n\nBy convention, a distinct government is named for the largest party that leads it.[72][73][74]\n\n\n\n### Current government\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: Sixth Labour Government of New Zealand\n\nThe current ministry, since January 2023, is the Labour Party government led by Prime Minister Chris Hipkins. The majority government has a cooperation agreement with the Green Party.[75]\n\n\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]\n\n* ![icon](image)Politics portal\n* ![flag](image)New Zealand portal\n\n\n* *K\u0101wanatanga*, a M\u0101ori word for \"governorship\", appearing in the Treaty of Waitangi\n* Politics of New Zealand, for a description of other jurisdictions, politics and political institutions\n* *New Zealand Gazette*, the official Government newspaper\n* New Zealand order of precedence\n* Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (New Zealand)\n* Official Opposition (New Zealand)\n\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n1. **^** 30 June 1852 is the date the Constitution Act 1852 was assented to.

Norway ranks as the second-wealthiest country in monetary value, with the largest capital reserve per capita of any nation.[149] According to the CIA World Factbook, Norway is a net external creditor of debt.[93] Norway reclaimed first place in the world in the UNDP Human Development Index (HDI) in 2009.[150] The standard of living in Norway is among the highest in the world. *Foreign Policy* magazine ranks Norway last in its Failed States Index for 2009 and 2023, judging Norway to be the world's most well-functioning and stable country. The OECD ranks Norway fourth in the 2013 equalised Better Life Index and third in intergenerational earnings elasticity.[151][152]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe country is richly endowed with natural resources including petroleum, hydropower, fish, forests, and minerals. Large reserves of petroleum and natural gas were discovered in the 1960s, which led to an economic boom. Norway has obtained one of the highest standards of living in the world in part by having a large amount of natural resources compared to the size of the population. In 2011, 28% of state revenues were generated from the petroleum industry.[162]\n\n\nNorway was the first country to ban deforestation, with a view to preventing its rain forests from vanishing. The country declared its intention at the UN Climate Summit in 2014 alongside Great Britain and Germany.[163]\n\n\n\n### Resources\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nKing Charles III John came to the throne of Norway and Sweden in 1818 and reigned to 1844. He protected the constitution and liberties of Norway and Sweden during the age of Metternich.[*neutrality is disputed*] As such, he was regarded as a liberal monarch. However, he was ruthless in his use of paid informers, secret police and restrictions on the freedom of the press to put down public movements for reform\u2014especially the Norwegian national independence movement.[66]\n\n\nThe Romantic Era that followed the reign of Charles III John brought some significant social and political reforms. In 1854, women won the right to inherit property. In 1863, the last trace of keeping unmarried women in the status of minors was removed. Furthermore, women were eligible for different occupations, particularly the common school teacher.[67] By mid-century, Norway's democracy was limited; voting was limited to officials, property owners, leaseholders and burghers of incorporated towns.[68]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe monarch officially retains executive power. But following the introduction of a parliamentary system of government, the duties of the monarch became strictly representative and ceremonial.[119] The Monarch is commander-in-chief of the Norwegian Armed Forces, and serves as chief diplomatic official abroad and as a symbol of unity. Harald V of the House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl\u00fccksburg ascended to the Norwegian throne in 1991, the first since the 14th century who has been born in the country.[120] Haakon, Crown Prince of Norway, is the heir to the throne.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n### Dissolution of the union and the First World War\n\n[edit]\n\nMain articles: Union dissolution referendum and Dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden\n\nChristian Michelsen, Prime Minister of Norway from 1905 to 1907, played a central role in the peaceful separation of Norway from Sweden on 7 June 1905. A national referendum confirmed the people's preference for a monarchy over a republic. However, no Norwegian could legitimately claim the throne, since none of Norway's noble families could claim royal descent.\n\n\nThe government then offered the throne of Norway to Prince Carl of Denmark, a prince of the Dano-German royal house of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl\u00fccksburg and a distant relative of Norway's medieval kings. Following the plebiscite, he was unanimously elected king by the Norwegian Parliament; he took the name Haakon VII.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n1. **^** Names in the official and recognised languages: Bokm\u00e5l: *Norge* [\u02c8n\u0254\u0302r\u0261\u0259] \u24d8; Nynorsk: *Noreg\u24d8*; Official names in minority languages: Northern Sami: *Norga*; Lule Sami: *Vuodna*; Southern Sami: *N\u00f6\u00f6rje*; Kven: *Norja*\n\n1. **^** Written Bokm\u00e5l and Nynorsk\n2. **^** Northern, Lule, and Southern\n3. **^** Including indigenous group S\u00e1mi, and minority groups Jewish, Traveller, Forest Finn, Romani, and Kven.\n4. **^** Until the 2012 constitutional amendment the Evangelical-Lutheran religion was the public religion of the State.[10]\n5. ^ ***a*** ***b*** The Spitsbergen Treaty (also known as the Svalbard Treaty) of 9 February 1920 recognises Norway's full and absolute sovereignty over the arctic archipelago of Spitsbergen (now called Svalbard).[19]\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n### Citations\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n138. **^** Aslaug Moksnes. *Likestilling eller s\u00e6rstilling?

The investment choices of the Norwegian fund are directed by ethical guidelines; for example, the fund is not allowed to invest in companies that produce parts for nuclear weapons.

It is bordered by Finland and Russia to the northeast and the Skagerrak strait to the south. Norway has an extensive coastline facing the North Atlantic Ocean and the Barents Sea. Harald V of the House of Gl\u00fccksburg is the current King. Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re has been Prime Minister since 2021. As a unitary state with a constitutional monarchy, Norway divides state power between the parliament, the cabinet, and the supreme court, as determined by the 1814 constitution. The unified kingdom of Norway was established in 872 as a merger of petty kingdoms and has existed continuously for 1151\u20131152 years. From 1537 to 1814, Norway was part of Denmark\u2013Norway, and, from 1814 to 1905, it was in a personal union with Sweden. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)A municipal and regional reform: \"On 8 June 2017, the Storting decided the following merger of counties.\"\nNorway, a unitary state, is divided into eleven first-level administrative counties (*fylke*). The counties are administered through directly elected county assemblies who elect the County Governor. Additionally, the King and government are represented in every county by a fylkesmann, who effectively acts as a Governor.[131] The counties are then sub-divided into 356 second-level municipalities (*kommuner*), which in turn are administered by directly elected municipal council, headed by a mayor and a small executive cabinet. The capital of Oslo is considered both a county and a municipality. Norway has two integral overseas territories out of mainland: Jan Mayen and Svalbard, the only developed island in the archipelago of the same name, located far to the north of the Norwegian mainland.[132]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn practice, the Prime Minister exercises the executive powers. Constitutionally, legislative power is vested with both the government and the Parliament of Norway, but the latter is the supreme legislature and a unicameral body.[121] Norway is fundamentally structured as a representative democracy. The Parliament can pass a law by simple majority of the 169 representatives, of which 150 are elected directly from 19 constituencies, and an additional 19 seats (\"levelling seats\") are allocated on a nationwide basis to make the representation in parliament correspond better with the popular vote for the political parties. A 4% election threshold is required for a party to gain levelling seats in Parliament.[122]\n\n\nThe Parliament of Norway, called the *Storting*, ratifies national treaties developed by the executive branch.

In the north, its territory was increased by the acquisition of the northern provinces of Troms and Finnmark, at the expense of Sweden and Russia.\n\n\nThe famine of 1695\u20131696 killed roughly 10% of Norway's population.[60] The harvest failed in Scandinavia at least nine times between 1740 and 1800, with great loss of life.[61]\n\n\n\n### Later modern period\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: United Kingdoms of Sweden and Norway\n\nSee also: Norwegian protectorate and Norwegian romantic nationalism\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nNordic Council\n |\n| --- |\n| Full members | * ![](image)\u00a0Denmark\n* ![](image)\u00a0Finland\n* ![](image)\u00a0Iceland\n* ![](image)\u00a0Norway\n* ![](image)\u00a0Sweden\n | ![Flag of the Nordic Council](image)\n |\n| Associate members | * ![](image)\u00a0\u00c5land\n* ![](image)\u00a0Faroe Islands\n* ![](image)\u00a0Greenland\n |\n| Observer / offices | * ![](image)\u00a0S\u00e1pmi\n* ![](image)\u00a0Estonia (identity)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Latvia\n* ![](image)\u00a0Lithuania\n* ![](image)\u00a0Schleswig-Holstein\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)A satellite image of continental Norway in winter\nNorway's core territory comprises the western and northernmost portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula; the remote island of Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard are also included.[note 5] The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom.

Formerly, the PM had to have more than half the members of cabinet be members of the Church of Norway; this rule was removed in 2012. The issue of separation of church and state in Norway has been increasingly controversial. A part of this is the evolution of the public school subject Christianity, a required subject since 1739. Even the state's loss in a battle at the European Court of Human Rights at Strasbourg[124] in 2007 did not settle the matter. As of 1 January 2017, the Church of Norway is a separate legal entity, and no longer a branch of the civil service.[125]\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

The fact that Germany is an economic powerhouse makes it an attractive destination for those searching for employment after studying.

In June 1976, Spain's new King Juan Carlos dismissed Carlos Arias Navarro and appointed the reformer Adolfo Su\u00e1rez as Prime Minister.[98][99] The resulting general election in 1977 convened the *Constituent Cortes* (the Spanish Parliament, in its capacity as a constitutional assembly) for the purpose of drafting and approving the constitution of 1978.[100] After a national referendum on 6 December 1978, 88% of voters approved of the new constitution. As a result, Spain is now composed of 17 autonomous communities and two autonomous cities with varying degrees of autonomy thanks to its Constitution, which nevertheless explicitly states the indivisible unity of the Spanish nation.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n97. **^** Biodiversidad, Fundaci\u00f3n (18 February 2014). \"The Foundation\". *Fundaci\u00f3n Biodiversidad*.

It reached its apogee during the reigns of the first two Spanish Habsburgs\u2014Charles V/I (1516\u20131556) and Philip II (1556\u20131598). This period saw the Italian Wars, the Schmalkaldic War, the Dutch Revolt, the War of the Portuguese Succession, clashes with the Ottomans, intervention in the French Wars of Religion and the Anglo-Spanish War.[42]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The hemicycle of the Congress of Deputies\nSpain is a constitutional monarchy, with a hereditary monarch and a bicameral parliament, the *Cortes Generales* (English: Spanish Parliament, lit.\u2009'General Courts').[104] The legislative branch is made up of the Congress of Deputies (*Congreso de los Diputados*), a lower house with 350 members, elected by popular vote on block lists by proportional representation to serve four-year terms, and the Senate (*Senado*), an upper house with 259 seats of which 208 are directly elected by popular vote, using a limited voting method, and the other 51 appointed by the regional legislatures to also serve four-year terms. The executive branch consists of a Council of Ministers presided over by the Prime Minister, who is nominated as candidate by the monarch after holding consultations with representatives from the different parliamentary groups, voted in by the members of the lower house during an investiture session and then formally appointed by the monarch.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring this war, a new dynasty originating in France, the Bourbons, was installed. The Crowns of Castile and Aragon had been long united only by the Monarchy and the common institution of the Inquisition's Holy Office.[47] A number of reform policies (the so-called Bourbon Reforms) were pursued by the Monarchy with the overarching goal of centralized authority and administrative uniformity.[48] They included the abolishment of many of the old regional privileges and laws,[49] as well as the customs barrier between the Crowns of Aragon and Castile in 1717, followed by the introduction of new property taxes in the Aragonese kingdoms.[50]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter a period of Crown-supported dictatorship from 1923 to 1931, the first elections since 1923, largely understood as a plebiscite on Monarchy, took place: the 12 April 1931 municipal elections. These gave a resounding victory to the Republican-Socialist candidacies in large cities and provincial capitals, with a majority of monarchist councilors in rural areas. The king left the country and the proclamation of the Republic on 14 April ensued, with the formation of a provisional government.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Spanish administration approved the *Gender Equality Act* in 2007 aimed at furthering equality between genders in Spanish political and economic life.[101] According to Inter-Parliamentary Union data as of 1 September 2018, 137 of the 350 members of the Congress were women (39.1%), while in the Senate, there were 101 women out of 266 (39.9%), placing Spain 16th on their list of countries ranked by proportion of women in the lower (or single) House.[102] The Gender Empowerment Measure of Spain in the United Nations Human Development Report is 0.794, 12th in the world.[103]\n\n\n\n### Government\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe 18th century saw a gradual recovery and an increase in prosperity through much of the empire. The predominant economic policy was an interventionist one, and the State also pursued policies aiming towards infrastructure development as well as the abolition of internal customs and the reduction of export tariffs.[51] Projects of agricultural colonisation with new settlements took place in the south of mainland Spain.[52] Enlightenment ideas began to gain ground among some of the kingdom's elite and monarchy.\n\n\n\n### Liberalism and nation state\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Contemporary history of Spain\n\nMain articles: Mid-19th-century Spain, Spanish American wars of independence, Spanish\u2013American War, Anarchism in Spain, and Second Spanish Republic\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n171. **^** Joseph Harrison, David Corkill (2004). \"*Spain: a modern European economy*\".
