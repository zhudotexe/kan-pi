The series depicts four young women living in New York City. The show's premise was drawn from Dunham's own life, as were major aspects of the main character, including financial isolation from her parents, becoming a writer, and making unfortunate decisions.[1]\n\n\nThe first season of *Girls* was filmed between April and August 2011. The first three episodes were screened at the 2012 SXSW Festival and the series premiered on HBO on April 15, 2012.[2] The series ran for six seasons until April 16, 2017. There were a total of 62 episodes.[3][4]\n\n\nThe show has received critical praise and awards, including the Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series \u2013 Musical or Comedy and the British Academy Television Award for Best International Programme.\n\n\n\n\n## Synopsis\n\n[edit]\n\nTwo years after graduating from Oberlin College, aspiring writer Hannah Horvath is shocked when her parents announce they will no longer financially support her life in Brooklyn, New York. Left to her own devices, Hannah navigates her twenties \"one mistake at a time.\"[5] Allison Williams, Jemima Kirke, Zosia Mamet, Adam Driver, Alex Karpovsky, and Andrew Rannells co-star as Hannah's circle of friends.\n\n\n\n## Cast and characters\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Promotional poster for the series premiere showing the cast. From left to right: Jemima Kirke (Jessa), Allison Williams (Marnie), Lena Dunham (Hannah), and Zosia Mamet (Shoshanna).\nMain article: List of Girls characters\n\n* Lena Dunham as Hannah Helene Horvath: an aspiring writer living in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, originally from East Lansing, Michigan, known for her spunk and bad decisions, who struggles to support herself and find a direction in her life. In season two, she struggles with a relapse of the OCD symptoms she suffered from in her youth. In the final season, she becomes pregnant after a brief fling, and later leaves New York City to take a teaching job upstate and raise her baby.[6]\n* Allison Williams as Marnie Marie Michaels: Hannah's best friend and, at the start of season 1, roommate. Domineering and arguably as self-centred and narcissistic as Hannah, Marnie struggles in her relationships with Charlie and Ray for much of the series, and eventually ends up marrying her musical partner, Desi Harperin. When both her career and her marriage collapse, she eventually moves upstate with Hannah to help raise her baby.[7]\n* Jemima Kirke as Jessa Johansson: One of Hannah's closest friends, Jessa is a global citizen of British origin, and is known for being bohemian, unpredictable, and brash. Jessa navigates many life struggles and poor choices, including a short-lived marriage and a stint in rehab due to heroin and cocaine addiction. When she pursues a relationship with Hannah's ex-boyfriend, Adam, she and Hannah have an explosive falling out. Ultimately, she manages to make her peace with Hannah before she leaves New York.[8]\n* Zosia Mamet as Shoshanna Shapiro: Jessa's naive and innocent American cousin who's a Media, Culture, and Communications major at New York University. She is embarrassed to still be a virgin at the start of the series.[9] The character is fast talking and her lack of enunciation gives her a mumbling, nervous persona. After a brief career stint in Japan, she comes to realize that her friendship with the other three has only ever held her back, and ultimately distances herself from them.[10]\n* Adam Driver as Adam Sackler: an aloof, passionate young man, Adam works as a part-time carpenter and actor. At the start of the series, he is in a casual relationship with Hannah, which becomes serious before ultimately falling apart as he gains success as an actor. He later enters a volatile relationship with Jessa, which is implied to be ongoing as the series ends. Adam is an alcoholic who has been sober for years.[11]\n* Alex Karpovsky as Raymond \"Ray\" Ploshansky (seasons 2\u20136; recurring season 1):[12] Originally Charlie's friend, but later a friend of the others, and the group's straight man. Eventually, he has sexual and romantic relationships with both Shoshanna and Marnie. At the start of season 3, he is made manager of a spin-off of Grumpy's, called Ray's.\n* Andrew Rannells as Elijah Krantz (seasons 4\u20136; recurring seasons 1\u20133):[13] Hannah's ex-boyfriend from college, who reveals that he is gay. Despite some initial hostility between the pair, they eventually become friends and later roommates on and off. The two grow much closer as roommates.\n* Ebon Moss-Bachrach as Desi Harperin (seasons 4\u20136; recurring season 3): Adam's co-star in *Major Barbara* and Marnie's bandmate. They become engaged, and later marry. Marnie eventually ends the relationship with him when she tires of his childishness and self-indulgence. In season 6, it is revealed that Desi is addicted to prescription pain killers after Marnie cheats on Ray with him.\n* Jake Lacy as Fran Parker (season 5; recurring season 4): A colleague of Hannah's whom she dates. In season 5, Fran moves in with Hannah and Elijah, but he and Hannah break up by the end of the season.\n\n\n## Production\n\n[edit]\n\nLena Dunham's 2010 second feature, *Tiny Furniture*\u2014which she wrote, directed and starred in\u2014received positive reviews at festivals as well as awards attention, including Best Narrative Feature at South by Southwest and Best First Screenplay at the 2010 Independent Spirit Awards.[14][15] The independent film's success earned her the opportunity to collaborate with Judd Apatow for an HBO pilot.[16] Judd Apatow said he was drawn to Dunham's imagination after watching *Tiny Furniture*, and added that *Girls* would provide men with an insight into \"realistic females.\"[1]\n\n\nSome of the struggles facing Dunham's character Hannah\u2014including being cut off financially from her parents, becoming a writer and making unfortunate decisions\u2014are inspired by Dunham's real-life experiences.[1] The show's look is achieved by furnishings at a number of vintage boutiques in New York, including Brooklyn Flea and Geminola owned by Jemima Kirke's mother.[17]\n\n\nDunham said *Girls* reflects a part of the population not portrayed in the 1998 HBO series *Sex and the City*. \"*Gossip Girl* was teens duking it out on the Upper East Side and *Sex and the City* was women who [had] figured out work and friends and now want to nail romance and family life. There was this 'hole-in-between' space that hadn't really been addressed,\" she said.[1] The pilot intentionally references *Sex and the City* as producers wanted to make it clear that the driving force behind *Girls* is that the characters were inspired by the former HBO series and moved to New York to pursue their dreams.[1] Dunham herself says she \"revere[s] that show just as much as any girl of her generation\".[1]\n\n\nAs executive producer,[18] Dunham and Jennifer Konner were both showrunners of the series while Dunham was the head writer.[19][20] Apatow is also executive producer,[18] under his Apatow Productions label. Dunham wrote or co-wrote all ten episodes of the first season and directed five, including the pilot.[18][21] Season one was filmed between April and August 2011 and consisted of 10 episodes. As did the second season, running on HBO from January 13, 2013, to March 17, 2013.\n\n\nOn April 4, 2013,[*citation needed*] Christopher Abbott left the series. Dunham announced via Instagram on September 6, 2013, that production for the third season had concluded.[22][23] Season 3, which contained 12 episodes as opposed to the previous 10-episode seasons, ran from January 12, 2014, to March 23, 2014. The fourth season of the series started filming in April 2014.[24] On January 5, 2016, HBO announced that the series' sixth season would be its last, allowing the writers to create a proper finale.[25]\n\n\n\n## Episodes\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: List of Girls episodes\n\n| Season | Episodes | Originally aired |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| First aired | Last aired | Network |\n| 1 | 10 | April\u00a015,\u00a02012\u00a0(2012-04-15) | June\u00a017,\u00a02012\u00a0(2012-06-17) | HBO |\n| 2 | 10 | January\u00a013,\u00a02013\u00a0(2013-01-13) | March\u00a017,\u00a02013\u00a0(2013-03-17) |\n| 3 | 12 | January\u00a012,\u00a02014\u00a0(2014-01-12) | March\u00a023,\u00a02014\u00a0(2014-03-23) |\n| 4 | 10 | January\u00a011,\u00a02015\u00a0(2015-01-11) | March\u00a022,\u00a02015\u00a0(2015-03-22) |\n| 5 | 10 | February\u00a021,\u00a02016\u00a0(2016-02-21) | April\u00a017,\u00a02016\u00a0(2016-04-17) |\n| 6 | 10 | February\u00a012,\u00a02017\u00a0(2017-02-12) | April\u00a016,\u00a02017\u00a0(2017-04-16) |\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n## Reception\n\n[edit]\n\n### Critical response\n\n[edit]\n\n#### Season 1\n\n[edit]\n\nThe first season of *Girls* received universal acclaim from television critics. On review aggregation website Metacritic, the series' first season holds an average of 87 based on 29 reviews.[26] The website also lists the show as the highest-rated fictional series debut of 2012.\n\n\nJames Poniewozik from *Time* reserved high praise for the series, calling it \"raw, audacious, nuanced and richly, often excruciatingly funny\".[27] Tim Goodman of *The Hollywood Reporter* called *Girls* \"one of the most original, spot-on, no-missed-steps series in recent memory\". Reviewing the first three episodes at the 2012 SXSW Festival, he said the series conveys \"real female friendships, the angst of emerging adulthood, nuanced relationships, sexuality, self-esteem, body image, intimacy in a tech-savvy world that promotes distance, the bloodlust of surviving New York on very little money and the modern parenting of entitled children, among many other things\u2014all laced together with humor and poignancy\".[28] *The New York Times* also applauded the series and said: \"*Girls* may be the millennial generation's rebuttal to *Sex and the City*, but the first season was at times as cruelly insightful and bleakly funny as *Louie* on FX or *Curb Your Enthusiasm* on HBO.\"[29]\n\n\nDespite many positive reviews, several critics criticized the characters themselves. Gawker's John Cook strongly criticized *Girls*, saying it was \"a television program about the children of wealthy famous people and shitty music and Facebook and how hard it is to know who you are and Thought Catalog and sexually transmitted diseases and the exhaustion of ceaselessly dramatizing your own life while posing as someone who understands the fundamental emptiness and narcissism of that very self-dramatization.\"[30]\n\n\n\n#### Season 2\n\n[edit]\n\nThe second season of *Girls* continued to receive critical acclaim. On Metacritic, the second season of the series holds an average of 84 based on 19 reviews.[31] \nTim Goodman of *The Hollywood Reporter* stated that \"*Girls* kicks off its second season even more assured of itself, able to deftly work strands of hard-earned drama into the free-flowing comedic moments of four postcollege girls trying to find their way in life\".[32] David Wiegland of the *San Francisco Chronicle* said that \"The entire constellation of impetuous, ambitious, determined and insecure young urbanites in *Girls* is realigning in the new season, but at no point in the four episodes sent to critics for review do you feel that any of it is artificial\".[33] Verne Gay of *Newsday* said it is \"Sharper, smarter, more richly layered, detailed and acted\".[34] Ken Tucker of *Entertainment Weekly* felt that \"As bright-eyed and bushy-tailed as it was in its first season, *Girls* may now be even spunkier, funnier, and riskier\".[35] In reference to the series' growth, Willa Paskin of *Salon* thought that *Girls* \"has matured by leaps and bounds, comedically and structurally, but it has jettisoned some of its ambiguity, its sweetness, its own affection for its characters. It's more coherent, but it's also safer.\"[36]\n\n\n\n\n\nMetacritic ratings per season\n| \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

On Metacritic, the third season of the series holds an average of 76 based on 18 reviews.[37] Rotten Tomatoes reports an 89% approval rating from critics, based on 27 reviews with an average score of 7.8/10. The consensus states: \"Still rife with shock value, Season 3 of *Girls* also benefits from an increasingly mature tone.\"[41]\n\n\nTim Goodman of *The Hollywood Reporter* lauded the first two episodes, and commented: \"Going into its third season, Girls is as refreshing and audacious as ever and one of the few half-hour dramedies where you can feel its heart pounding and see its belly ripple with laughter.\"[42] In addition, *The New York Times*, *Entertainment Weekly* and *PopMatters* praised the comedic portrayal of its lead female characters.[43][44][45]\n\n\n\n#### Season 4\n\n[edit]\n\nThe fourth season of *Girls* received generally positive reviews. On Metacritic, the fourth season of the series holds an average of 75 based on 16 reviews.[38] Rotten Tomatoes reports an 83% approval rating from critics, based on 24 reviews with an average score of 7.5/10. The consensus states: \"*Girls* is familiar after four seasons, but its convoluted-yet-comical depiction of young women dealing with the real world still manages to impress.\"[46]\n\n\n\n#### Season 5\n\n[edit]\n\nThe fifth season of *Girls* received generally positive reviews. On Metacritic, the fifth season of the series holds an average of 73 based on 13 reviews.[39] Rotten Tomatoes reports an 85% \"Certified Fresh\" approval rating from critics, based on 20 reviews with an average score of 8.14/10. The consensus states: \"Though some characters have devolved into caricatures, watching them struggle in *Girls* is more fun in season five, with sharper humor and narrative consistency than prior seasons.\"[47] \nDaniel Fienberg of *The Hollywood Reporter* gave the season a positive review writing: \"*Girls* had only a niche audience. It's possible that being freed from the responsibility of the zeitgeist is what has kept *Girls* so watchable. The start of the fifth season won't launch an armada of think pieces, but if you still get pleasure from watching these flawed, often awful characters make flawed, often funny choices, *Girls* is still *Girls*.\"[48]\n\n\n\n#### Season 6\n\n[edit]\n\nThe sixth season of *Girls* received highly positive reviews from critics. On Metacritic, the sixth season of the series holds an average of 79 based on 15 reviews.[40] Rotten Tomatoes reports an 89% approval rating from critics, based on 35 reviews with an average score of 8.01/10. The consensus states, \"In its final season, *Girls* remains uncompromising, intelligent, character-driven, compassionate \u2013 and at times consciously aggravating.\"[49]\n\n\nThe broadcast of the season's third episode \"American Bitch\" in Australia on showcase had to be edited, due to a scene that breached the maximum MA15+ classification of the broadcaster.[50]\n\n\n\n### Criticism and impact\n\n[edit]\n\nThe pilot was met with criticism regarding the all-white main cast in the otherwise culturally diverse setting of New York City.[51] Catherine Scott of *The Independent* asked: \"What's there to celebrate for feminism when black, Hispanic or Asian women are totally written out of a series that's supposedly set in one of the most diverse cities on earth? But also, what's there to celebrate for feminism when a show depicts four entirely self-interested young women and a lead character having the most depressing, disempowered sexual relationships imaginable?\"[52] Fox News's Hollie McKay wrote that many white Americans are friends with other people of the same race, and adding a \"token\" African-American or Asian-American friend would be \"immature\" to reality.[53] Writing at *The Hairpin*, Jenna Wortham deemed the series' lack of a main black character \"alienating, a party of four engineered to appeal to a very specific subset of the television viewing audience, when the show has the potential to be so much bigger than that\".[54] Maureen Ryan from *The Huffington Post* attributes the lack of diversity to the industry as a whole, specifying that not only is it \"easier (and lazier) to attack a 25-year-old woman who's just starting out than to attack the men twice her age who actually control the industry\", but that \"of all shows, this is the one that is being attacked for being too white.\"[55]\n\n\nLesley Arfin, a writer for the show, responded to the criticism, tweeting: \"What really bothered me most about *Precious* was that there was no representation of ME\". Arfin later deleted the comment following backlash.[56] Dunham has publicly said, \"I really wrote the show from a gut-level place, and each character was a piece of me or based on someone close to me\". She adds that she wanted to avoid tokenism in casting. The experience of a black character would involve a certain specificity, a type she could not speak to.[57]\n\n\n*The New York Times* concluded that the series earned praise \"for its sexually frank, wryly satirical look at millennial angst\" and criticism \"for its lack of diversity while raising \"an endless stream of essays and social media posts thanks to its explorations of gender politics and post-collegiate social panic\".[58] In a review for *Ms.*, Kerensa Cadenas writes, \"Despite its lack of a serious class and race consciousness, *Girls* does address other feminist issues currently in play, among them body image, abortion, relationships within a social media age, and street harassment.\"[59] Kim Price of *The Independent* predicted that the *Girls*' legacy would be the series' \"mainstreaming of 'gross-out' femininity\" and \"intermittent and sometimes cack-handed attempts to comment on contemporary issues such as race relations or lack of opportunities for young people\".[60]\n\n\n\n### Accolades\n\n[edit]\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Award\n | Category\n | Nominee(s)\n | Result\n | Episode\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2012\n | 2nd Critics' Choice
