He is a member and co-founder of the Sidemen, a British YouTube group.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nBarn is of Indian descent[3] and was born on 2 August 1995[4] in Guildford, Surrey, England,[5] where he lived until eight years of age.[6] He later lived in Sheffield where he attended Silverdale School.[7] He is the youngest of three children.[8] Barn was offered a place to study natural sciences at University College London, but he ended up declining the offer in order to pursue his YouTube career full-time.[9]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nBarn joined YouTube in 2010; having played games with his friends he got into watching YouTubers and making videos of their own. Eventually he decided to launch his own channel, stating:[10]\n\n\n\n\n> I got involved thinking I might be able to do a little bit better than they were doing, and get involved and have some fun with it. I started recording myself playing *Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2*. I started making tutorial videos that people could watch – some of them were for knives and how you could throw them across the map. I made videos showing places where you could throw a knife or tomahawk and get a kill. I thought it would be cool to show off these ridiculous kills.\n> \n> \n\n\nAs his popularity increased, he began to take it more seriously, branching out into *Minecraft*.[10]\n\n\nIn 2013, he joined the Sidemen, which caused his popularity to rise further.[11] He would later move in with three other members, sharing a house with them from 2014 to 2018, when he announced he was moving out of the Sidemen House.[12][13] He is also part of the Dream SMP server.[14]\n\n\nIn January 2021, he announced on his channel that he was quitting playing *Call of Duty: Warzone* due to a proliferation of cheating,[15] saying hackers would be \"the death of the game\" if it went unfixed.[16] Along with criticism from several other high-profile streamers, the resulting uproar caused Activision to update the game's anti-cheat software.[17]\n\n\n\n## Other ventures[edit]\n\n\nBarn is an investor in esports teams and has spoken about how he has invested in London Royal Ravens, a *Call of Duty* team, speaking of his desire to 'build a blueprint' for the wider popularisation of the sport.[18]\n\n\nOn 28 September 2023, Barn released a single with Alan Walker and Dash Berlin titled \"Better Off (Alone, Pt. III)\" on digital platforms.[19]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2021, Barn announced his engagement to his longtime girlfriend.[20] They got married in 2023.[21]\n\n\n\n## Filmography[edit]\n\n\n\n\nFilm\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2023\n | *KSI: In Real Life* | Himself\n | Documentary; Cameo\n |  |\n\n\n\n\nWeb roles\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Network\n | Notes\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2014\n | *The Sidemen Experience* | Himself\n | Comedy Central UK | Main role; 5 episodes\n | [22] |\n| 2018\n | *The Sidemen Show* | YouTube Premium | Main role; 7 episodes\n | [23] |\n| 2020\n | *How To Be Behzinga* | YouTube | 1 episode\n | [24] |\n\n\n\n\nTelevision roles\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Network\n | Notes\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2021\n | *The Wheel* | Himself / Celebrity expert (Gaming)\n | BBC One | Series 1, episode 6\n | [25] |\n\n\n## Discography[edit]\n\n\n### Singles[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Title\n | Year\n | Album\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| \"Better Off (Alone, Pt.

He is a member and co-founder of the Sidemen, a British YouTube group.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nBarn is of Indian descent[3] and was born on 2 August 1995[4] in Guildford, Surrey, England,[5] where he lived until eight years of age.[6] He later lived in Sheffield where he attended Silverdale School.[7] He is the youngest of three children.[8] Barn was offered a place to study natural sciences at University College London, but he ended up declining the offer in order to pursue his YouTube career full-time.[9]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nBarn joined YouTube in 2010; having played games with his friends he got into watching YouTubers and making videos of their own. Eventually he decided to launch his own channel, stating:[10]\n\n\n\n\n> I got involved thinking I might be able to do a little bit better than they were doing, and get involved and have some fun with it. I started recording myself playing *Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2*. I started making tutorial videos that people could watch – some of them were for knives and how you could throw them across the map. I made videos showing places where you could throw a knife or tomahawk and get a kill. I thought it would be cool to show off these ridiculous kills.\n> \n> \n\n\nAs his popularity increased, he began to take it more seriously, branching out into *Minecraft*.[10]\n\n\nIn 2013, he joined the Sidemen, which caused his popularity to rise further.[11] He would later move in with three other members, sharing a house with them from 2014 to 2018, when he announced he was moving out of the Sidemen House.[12][13] He is also part of the Dream SMP server.[14]\n\n\nIn January 2021, he announced on his channel that he was quitting playing *Call of Duty: Warzone* due to a proliferation of cheating,[15] saying hackers would be \"the death of the game\" if it went unfixed.[16] Along with criticism from several other high-profile streamers, the resulting uproar caused Activision to update the game's anti-cheat software.[17]\n\n\n\n## Other ventures[edit]\n\n\nBarn is an investor in esports teams and has spoken about how he has invested in London Royal Ravens, a *Call of Duty* team, speaking of his desire to 'build a blueprint' for the wider popularisation of the sport.[18]\n\n\nOn 28 September 2023, Barn released a single with Alan Walker and Dash Berlin titled \"Better Off (Alone, Pt. III)\" on digital platforms.[19]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2021, Barn announced his engagement to his longtime girlfriend.[20] They got married in 2023.[21]\n\n\n\n## Filmography[edit]\n\n\n\n\nFilm\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2023\n | *KSI: In Real Life* | Himself\n | Documentary; Cameo\n |  |\n\n\n\n\nWeb roles\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Network\n | Notes\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2014\n | *The Sidemen Experience* | Himself\n | Comedy Central UK | Main role; 5 episodes\n | [22] |\n| 2018\n | *The Sidemen Show* | YouTube Premium | Main role; 7 episodes\n | [23] |\n| 2020\n | *How To Be Behzinga* | YouTube | 1 episode\n | [24] |\n\n\n\n\nTelevision roles\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Network\n | Notes\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2021\n | *The Wheel* | Himself / Celebrity expert (Gaming)\n | BBC One | Series 1, episode 6\n | [25] |\n\n\n## Discography[edit]\n\n\n### Singles[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Title\n | Year\n | Album\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| \"Better Off (Alone, Pt.
