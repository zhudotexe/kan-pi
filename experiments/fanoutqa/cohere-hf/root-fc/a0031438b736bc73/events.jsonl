Thomas regularly breaks with Scalia, disagreeing on points of doctrine, finding a more measured and judicial tone, and calling for the elimination of bad law.

Wade*. He was also the most senior associate justice by that time.[210][211][212]\n\n\n\n### Government powers and legal structure[edit]\n\n\n#### Court precedent[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n4. **^** Thomas's close early association with Scalia came under scrutiny by critics in multiple law review articles. In November 1996, *Emerge* magazine titled him as \"Uncle Thomas: Lawn Jockey of the Far Right\".[181] Linda Greenhouse observed that Thomas voted with Scalia 91% of the time during October Term 2006, and with Justice John Paul Stevens the least, 36% of the time.[182] Biographer Jan Crawford noted that Scalia often joined Thomas instead of Thomas joining Scalia.[183][184] Biographer Corey Robin has called the idea that Thomas followed Scalia's votes a debunked myth.[185]\n5. **^** Thomas's jurisprudence has also been compared to that of Justice Hugo Black, who \"resisted the tendency to create social policy out of 'whole cloth.'\" According to the same critic, Thomas generally declines to engage in judicial lawmaking, viewing the Court's constitutional role as the interpretation of law, rather than making law.[192][193]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Clarence Thomas\n |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)Official portrait, 2007\n |\n|  |\n| Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States |\n| **Incumbent**\n |\n| **Assumed office** October 23, 1991 |\n| Nominated by | George H.

He became the subject of intense media criticism for his decisions, including from figures that supported his appointment. Having previously experienced scrutiny during his confirmation hearings, Thomas believed in producing results without regard for his public image, a characteristic which embodied his lack of questions during oral arguments. His conservative approach moved O'Connor to take liberal positions but attracted Scalia. He formed a friendship with Justice Byron White, with whom he shared multiple interests, and found support from Justice David Souter.[189][190]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSince the death of Antonin Scalia, Thomas has been the Court's foremost originalist, stressing the original meaning in interpreting the Constitution.[7] In contrast to Scalia—who had been the only other consistent originalist—he pursues a more classically liberal variety of originalism.[8] Thomas was known for his silence during most oral arguments,[9] though has since begun asking more questions to counsel.[10] He is notable for his majority opinions in *Good News Club v. Milford Central School* (determining the freedom of religious speech in relation to the First Amendment) and *New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen* (affirming the individual right to bear arms outside the home), as well as his dissent in *Gonzales v. Raich* (arguing that Congress may not criminalize the private cultivation of medical marijuana). He is widely considered the Court's most conservative member.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n21. **^** Foskett 2004, pp. 53.\n22. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Tumulty, Karen (July 5, 1991). \"Sister of High Court Nominee Traveled Different Road : Family: Although Clarence Thomas held her up as a horrible example, Emma Mae Martin defends her life and the choices she made\". *Los Angeles Times*.

Smith have characterized Thomas's philosophy as grounded in a form of black nationalism that sees governmental attempts to address racism as either futile or counterproductive.[287][288][289][290] That view contrasts with the belief that laws should be race-neutral because racial discrimination is no longer a serious problem in the United States.[286]\n\n\nThomas joined the majority in *Students for Fair Admissions v.

Marshall would later give advice to Thomas after the confirmation.[106][107]\nWhen Justice William Brennan retired from the Supreme Court in July 1990, Thomas was Bush's favorite among the five candidates on his shortlist for the position. However, Bush's advisors, including Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, considered Thomas inexperienced,[108] and he instead nominated David Souter of the First Circuit Court of Appeals.[65] A year later, Justice Thurgood Marshall announced his retirement on June 27, 1991, and Bush nominated Thomas to replace him.[109][110] Bush announced his selection on July 1, calling Thomas the \"best qualified at this time\".[65] Thornburgh cautioned Bush that replacing Marshall with any candidate who was not perceived to share Marshall's views would make confirmation difficult.[111]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring a 10-year period from February 2006 to February 2016, Thomas read his opinions from the bench but asked no questions during oral arguments.[317][318] He said in 2013 that it was \"unnecessary in deciding cases to ask that many questions ... we should listen to lawyers who are arguing their cases, and I think we should allow the advocates to advocate.\"[319] By May 2020, he had asked questions in two oral arguments since 2006.[320]\n\n\nThomas took a more active role in questioning when the Supreme Court shifted to holding teleconferenced arguments in May 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic;[321][322][323][320] before that, he had spoken during 32 of the roughly 2,400 arguments since 1991.[324] Since the court resumed in-person oral arguments at the beginning of the 2021 term, the justices agreed to allow Thomas to ask the first question to each advocate.[325]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn October 2020, Thomas joined the other justices in denying an appeal from Kim Davis, a county clerk who refused to give marriage licenses to same-sex couples, but wrote a separate opinion reiterating his dissent from *Obergefell v. Hodges* and expressing his belief that it was wrongly decided.[308][309][310] In July 2021, he was one of three justices, with Gorsuch and Alito, who voted to hear an appeal from a Washington florist who had refused service to a same-sex couple based on her religious beliefs against same-sex marriage.[311][312][313] In November 2021, Thomas dissented from the majority of justices in a 6-3 vote to reject an appeal from Mercy San Juan Medical Center, a hospital affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church, which had sought to deny a hysterectomy to a transgender patient on religious grounds.[314] Alito and Gorsuch also dissented, and the vote to reject the appeal left in place a lower court ruling in the patient's favor.[315][316]\n\n\n\n### Oral arguments[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Clarence Thomas at the *Biographical Directory of Federal Judges*, a publication of the Federal Judicial Center.\n* Clarence Thomas at Ballotpedia\n* Issue positions and quotes at On the Issues\n* Appearances on C-SPAN\n* Cornell Law School Biography of Clarence Thomas\n* Oyez, Official Supreme Court media, Clarence Thomas biography\n* Supreme Court Associate Justice Nomination Hearings on Clarence Thomas in September and October 1991 United States Government Publishing Office\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n290. **^** Szalai, Jennifer (September 23, 2019). \"'The Enigma of Clarence Thomas' Makes a Strong Case for Its Provocative Thesis\". *The New York Times*.

As a means to impartiality, he is an advocate of judicial restraint to limit judicial discretion.[191][e] Thomas has been the most-willing of all justices on the Court to overrule precedent; according to Scalia, \"he does not believe in *stare decisis*, period\".[194][195][f] By October 1, 2012, he had written 475 opinions, including 171 majority opinions, 138 concurrences, and 166 dissenting opinions—approximately 10 percent of the 1,772 cases the Court had decided since he was elevated.[197] In 2016, Thomas wrote nearly twice as many opinions as any other justice.[9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n345. **^** Heyer, Kristin E.; Rozell, Mark J.; Genovese, Michael A.

Wade*. He was also the most senior associate justice by that time.[210][211][212]\n\n\n\n### Government powers and legal structure[edit]\n\n\n#### Court precedent[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n4. **^** Thomas's close early association with Scalia came under scrutiny by critics in multiple law review articles. In November 1996, *Emerge* magazine titled him as \"Uncle Thomas: Lawn Jockey of the Far Right\".[181] Linda Greenhouse observed that Thomas voted with Scalia 91% of the time during October Term 2006, and with Justice John Paul Stevens the least, 36% of the time.[182] Biographer Jan Crawford noted that Scalia often joined Thomas instead of Thomas joining Scalia.[183][184] Biographer Corey Robin has called the idea that Thomas followed Scalia's votes a debunked myth.[185]\n5. **^** Thomas's jurisprudence has also been compared to that of Justice Hugo Black, who \"resisted the tendency to create social policy out of 'whole cloth.'\" According to the same critic, Thomas generally declines to engage in judicial lawmaking, viewing the Court's constitutional role as the interpretation of law, rather than making law.[192][193]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Clarence Thomas\n |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)Official portrait, 2007\n |\n|  |\n| Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States |\n| **Incumbent**\n |\n| **Assumed office** October 23, 1991 |\n| Nominated by | George H.

He became the subject of intense media criticism for his decisions, including from figures that supported his appointment. Having previously experienced scrutiny during his confirmation hearings, Thomas believed in producing results without regard for his public image, a characteristic which embodied his lack of questions during oral arguments. His conservative approach moved O'Connor to take liberal positions but attracted Scalia. He formed a friendship with Justice Byron White, with whom he shared multiple interests, and found support from Justice David Souter.[189][190]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSince the death of Antonin Scalia, Thomas has been the Court's foremost originalist, stressing the original meaning in interpreting the Constitution.[7] In contrast to Scalia—who had been the only other consistent originalist—he pursues a more classically liberal variety of originalism.[8] Thomas was known for his silence during most oral arguments,[9] though has since begun asking more questions to counsel.[10] He is notable for his majority opinions in *Good News Club v. Milford Central School* (determining the freedom of religious speech in relation to the First Amendment) and *New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen* (affirming the individual right to bear arms outside the home), as well as his dissent in *Gonzales v. Raich* (arguing that Congress may not criminalize the private cultivation of medical marijuana).

Smith have characterized Thomas's philosophy as grounded in a form of black nationalism that sees governmental attempts to address racism as either futile or counterproductive.[287][288][289][290] That view contrasts with the belief that laws should be race-neutral because racial discrimination is no longer a serious problem in the United States.[286]\n\n\nThomas joined the majority in *Students for Fair Admissions v.

However, Bush's advisors, including Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, considered Thomas inexperienced,[108] and he instead nominated David Souter of the First Circuit Court of Appeals.[65] A year later, Justice Thurgood Marshall announced his retirement on June 27, 1991, and Bush nominated Thomas to replace him.[109][110] Bush announced his selection on July 1, calling Thomas the \"best qualified at this time\".[65] Thornburgh cautioned Bush that replacing Marshall with any candidate who was not perceived to share Marshall's views would make confirmation difficult.[111]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring a 10-year period from February 2006 to February 2016, Thomas read his opinions from the bench but asked no questions during oral arguments.[317][318] He said in 2013 that it was \"unnecessary in deciding cases to ask that many questions ... we should listen to lawyers who are arguing their cases, and I think we should allow the advocates to advocate.\"[319] By May 2020, he had asked questions in two oral arguments since 2006.[320]\n\n\nThomas took a more active role in questioning when the Supreme Court shifted to holding teleconferenced arguments in May 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic;[321][322][323][320] before that, he had spoken during 32 of the roughly 2,400 arguments since 1991.[324] Since the court resumed in-person oral arguments at the beginning of the 2021 term, the justices agreed to allow Thomas to ask the first question to each advocate.[325]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn October 2020, Thomas joined the other justices in denying an appeal from Kim Davis, a county clerk who refused to give marriage licenses to same-sex couples, but wrote a separate opinion reiterating his dissent from *Obergefell v. Hodges* and expressing his belief that it was wrongly decided.[308][309][310] In July 2021, he was one of three justices, with Gorsuch and Alito, who voted to hear an appeal from a Washington florist who had refused service to a same-sex couple based on her religious beliefs against same-sex marriage.[311][312][313] In November 2021, Thomas dissented from the majority of justices in a 6-3 vote to reject an appeal from Mercy San Juan Medical Center, a hospital affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church, which had sought to deny a hysterectomy to a transgender patient on religious grounds.[314] Alito and Gorsuch also dissented, and the vote to reject the appeal left in place a lower court ruling in the patient's favor.[315][316]\n\n\n\n### Oral arguments[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Clarence Thomas at the *Biographical Directory of Federal Judges*, a publication of the Federal Judicial Center.\n* Clarence Thomas at Ballotpedia\n* Issue positions and quotes at On the Issues\n* Appearances on C-SPAN\n* Cornell Law School Biography of Clarence Thomas\n* Oyez, Official Supreme Court media, Clarence Thomas biography\n* Supreme Court Associate Justice Nomination Hearings on Clarence Thomas in September and October 1991 United States Government Publishing Office\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n290. **^** Szalai, Jennifer (September 23, 2019). \"'The Enigma of Clarence Thomas' Makes a Strong Case for Its Provocative Thesis\". *The New York Times*.

As a means to impartiality, he is an advocate of judicial restraint to limit judicial discretion.[191][e] Thomas has been the most-willing of all justices on the Court to overrule precedent; according to Scalia, \"he does not believe in *stare decisis*, period\".[194][195][f] By October 1, 2012, he had written 475 opinions, including 171 majority opinions, 138 concurrences, and 166 dissenting opinions—approximately 10 percent of the 1,772 cases the Court had decided since he was elevated.[197] In 2016, Thomas wrote nearly twice as many opinions as any other justice.[9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n345. **^** Heyer, Kristin E.; Rozell, Mark J.; Genovese, Michael A.

After a failed filibuster attempt by Senator John Kerry, the Senate confirmed Alito to the Supreme Court on January 31 by a vote of 58–42.[47] All Senate Republicans voted in favor of confirmation except Lincoln Chafee, and all Senate Democrats voted against confirmation except Tim Johnson, Robert Byrd, Kent Conrad, and Ben Nelson. An Independent, Jim Jeffords, voted against confirmation.[48][49] Alito was sworn in as an associate justice of the Supreme Court later that day.[50][51] He became the 110th justice, the second Italian-American,[52][53] the 11th Catholic in the history of the Supreme Court, and the fifth Catholic on the Court at the time he assumed office.[54]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe *ProPublica* report on unreported gifts to both Alito and Thomas led several Democratic members of Congress to call for ethics reform for the Supreme Court. This included a Senate Judiciary Committee proposal to establish a code of ethics for the Court.[92] In a July 2023 *Wall Street Journal* opinion column, Alito wrote, \"Congress did not create the Supreme Court [...] I know this is a controversial view, but I'm willing to say it. No provision in the Constitution gives them the authority to regulate the Supreme Court—period.\"[93] This declaration led to further debate among Democratic lawmakers. Senator Chris Murphy asserted that the Constitution gives Congress power to oversee the Court: \"It is just wrong on the facts to say that Congress doesn't have anything to do with the rules guiding the Supreme Court. In fact, from the very beginning, Congress has set those rules.\"[94]\n\n\n\n## Teaching[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Samuel A.

Justices Roberts, Scalia and Thomas were in favor of vacating the stay; Missouri had twice asked the justices to lift the stay and permit the execution.[61] Moreover, despite having been at one time nicknamed \"Scalito\", Alito's views have differed from those of Scalia (and Thomas), as in the Michael Taylor case and various other cases of the 2005 term.[*original research?*] A fierce critic of reliance on legislative history in statutory interpretation,[*citation needed*] Scalia was the only member of the Court in *Zedner v. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn his first term, Alito compiled a fairly conservative record.[*original research?*] For example, in the three reargued cases (*Garcetti v. Ceballos*, *Hudson v. Michigan* and *Kansas v. Marsh*), Alito created a 5–4 majority by voting with the four other conservative Justices – Chief Justice John G. Roberts and Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy, and Clarence Thomas. He further voted with the conservative wing of the court on *Sanchez-Llamas v. Oregon*[55] and *Rapanos v. United States*.

Carhart* that a state's ban on partial birth abortion was unconstitutional because such a ban did not have an exception in the case of a threat to the health of the mother. The membership of the Court changed after *Stenberg*, with Roberts and Alito replacing Rehnquist (a dissenter in *Roe*) and O'Connor (a supporter of *Roe*) respectively. Further, the ban at issue in *Gonzales v.

In two higher-profile cases, one involving the constitutionality of political gerrymandering and one involving campaign finance reform (*LULAC v. Perry* and *Randall v. Sorrell*), Alito adopted narrow positions, declining to join the bolder positions advanced by either philosophical side of the Court.[*original research?*] According to a SCOTUSblog analysis of 2005 term decisions, Alito and Scalia concurred in the result of 86% of decisions in which both participated, and concurred in full in 75%.[62] Alito also differed from Scalia in applying originalism flexibly to arrive at conservative outcomes \"with plodding consistency\", rather than following it so strictly as to occasionally produce outcomes unfavorable to conservatives.[63]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBecause Alito joined the Court mid-term, he did not participate in the decisions of most of the early cases in the Court term because he had not heard arguments for them. These decisions were released with an 8-member Court; none were 4–4, so Alito would not have been the deciding vote in any of them if he had participated. Only three of these cases  – *Garcetti v. Ceballos*, *Hudson v. Michigan*, and *Kansas v. Marsh*  – were reargued since a tie needed to be broken.\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn April 18, 2007, the Supreme Court handed down a decision ruling the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act constitutional. Kennedy wrote for the five-justice majority that Congress was within its power to generally ban the procedure, although the Court left open the door for as-applied challenges. Kennedy said that the challenged statute was consistent with the Court's prior decisions in *Roe v. Wade*, *Planned Parenthood v. Casey*, and *Stenberg v. Carhart*.\n\n\nAlito joined fully in the majority, as did Roberts. Thomas filed a concurring opinion, joined by Scalia, contending that the Court's prior decisions in *Roe v. Wade* and *Planned Parenthood v. Casey* should be reversed, and also noting that the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act may exceed the powers of Congress under the Commerce Clause. Alito, Roberts, and Kennedy did not join that assertion. Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, David Souter, Stephen Breyer, and John Paul Stevens dissented, contending that the ruling ignored Supreme Court abortion precedent.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAlito delivered his first written Supreme Court opinion on May 1, 2006, in *Holmes v. South Carolina*, a case involving the right of criminal defendants to present evidence that a third party committed the crime. From the beginning of the Rehnquist Court to the nomination of Justice Elena Kagan, each new justice has been given a unanimous opinion to write as their first Supreme Court opinion; this practice is designed to help \"break in\" new justices so that each justice has at least one unanimous, uncontroversial opinion under their belt.[*original research?*] Alito wrote for a unanimous court in ordering a new trial for Bobby Lee Holmes due to South Carolina's rule that barred such evidence based on the strength of the prosecution's case, rather than on the relevance and strength of the defense evidence itself. His other majority opinions in his first term were in *Zedner v. United States*, *Woodford v. Ngo*, and *Arlington Central School District Board of Education v. Murphy*.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAlito was raised in Hamilton Township, New Jersey, and was educated at Princeton University and Yale Law School. After graduating from law school, he worked as an assistant attorney general for the Office of Legal Counsel and served as the U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey. In 1990, Alito was appointed as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, where he served until joining the Supreme Court. He has called himself a \"practical originalist\" and has been described as one of the Court's \"most conservative justices\".\n\n\nAlito wrote the majority opinion in *Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization* (2022), in which the Supreme Court overturned its 1973 abortion rights decision *Roe v. Wade*. He has also written majority opinions in the landmark cases *McDonald v. Chicago*, *Burwell v. Hobby Lobby*, *Murphy v. NCAA*, and *Janus v.

In that capacity he argued 12 cases before the Supreme Court for the federal government.[21] In *Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians & Gynecologists* (1986), the Supreme Court ruled against Charles Fried after he rejected a memo by Alito urging the Solicitor General to avoid directly attacking the constitutional right to an abortion.[22] Alito lost only two of the cases he argued before the Supreme Court.[23]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAlito joined Thomas in writing a separate dissent in *Obergefell v. Hodges*.[64][65][66] In 2020, Alito wrote a dissent joined by Thomas to *Bostock v. Clayton County*, arguing that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 does not prohibit discrimination by sexual orientation or gender identity and criticizing the majority's interpretation of Title VII.[67][68] In October 2020, Alito agreed with the other justices on the denial of an appeal filed by Kim Davis, a county clerk who refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples.\n\n\nOn November 12, 2020, Alito made headlines for comments about the COVID-19 pandemic. Speaking to the Federalist Society, Alito criticized what he called the \"loss of individual liberties\", saying, \"We have never before seen restrictions as severe, extensive and prolonged as those experienced for most of 2020\" and calling the pandemic \"a Constitutional stress test\".[69]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs an adjunct professor at Seton Hall University School of Law in Newark from 1999 to 2004, Alito taught courses in constitutional law and an original course on terrorism and civil liberties. In 1995, he received the school's Saint Thomas More Medal \"in recognition of his outstanding contributions to the field of law\".[95] On May 25, 2007, he delivered the commencement address at Seton Hall Law's commencement ceremony and received an honorary law degree from the school.[96]\n\n\nAs a visiting professor at Duke University School of Law, Alito taught Current Issues in Constitutional Interpretation in fall 2011 and a course in the Master of Laws in Judicial Studies program in summer 2012.[97][*better source needed*]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn October 31, Bush announced that he was nominating Alito to O'Connor's seat, and he submitted the nomination to the Senate on November 10.[36] Alito was unanimously rated \"well qualified\" to fill the Associate Justice post by the American Bar Association's Standing Committee on Federal Judiciary, which measures the professional qualifications of a nominee.[37] The committee rates judges as \"not qualified\", \"qualified\", or \"well qualified\".[38] Leonard Leo was selected to play a role in shepherding Alito's appointment through the Senate.[39]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson, referencing his pending resignation, and Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, who had compared the ruling to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.[76][77] During an October 2022 talk at The Heritage Foundation, Alito said that the leaked opinion made some justices \"targets for assassination\", referring to the assassination attempt on fellow Justice Brett Kavanaugh during that year.[78] At the same event, he said that \"questioning [the Court's] integrity crosses an important line\", which many media commentators interpreted as criticism of Kagan's recent statements on the court's overturning of precedent during the past term.[79]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Sherman\n* Taft (Robert)\n* Taft (William)\n* Thurmond\n* Tilden\n* Trump\n* Vance\n* Wolfowitz\n* Yoo\n |\n| Jurists\n* Alito\n* Barrett\n* Bork\n* Burger\n* Butler\n* Colson\n* Goldsmith\n* Gorsuch\n* Harlan II\n* Kavanaugh\n* Kennedy\n* O'Connor\n* Parker\n* Rehnquist\n* Roberts\n* Scalia\n* Sessions\n* Sanford\n* Sutherland\n* Taft\n* Thomas\n |\n| Commentators\n* Beck\n* Bartiromo\n* Bongino\n* Breitbart\n* Buchanan\n* Buckley\n* Caldwell\n* Carlson\n* Cooper\n* Coulter\n* Crowder\n* D'Souza\n* Douthat\n* Dreher\n* Drudge\n* Elder\n* Grant\n* Hannity\n* Hodgetwins\n* Huckabee\n* Ingraham\n* Jones\n* Kirk\n* Klavan\n* Knowles\n* Krauthammer\n* Lahren\n* Levin\n* Limbaugh\n* North\n* Novak\n* O'Reilly\n* Owens\n* Palin\n* Park\n* Peterson\n* Podhoretz\n* Prager\n* Robertson\n* Rubin\n* Santorum\n* Shapiro\n* Tatum\n* Walsh\n* Watters\n* Weyrich\n* White\n* Will\n* Woods\n* Yarvin\n |\n| Activists\n* Bannon\n* Bozell III\n* Dobson\n* Falwell\n* Feulner\n* Gabriel\n* Graham\n* Horowitz\n* Kirk\n* Kristol (Bill)\n* LaHaye (Beverly)\n* LaHaye (Tim)\n* Owens\n* Prager\n* Reed\n* Rufo\n* Schlafly (Andrew)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSamuel Alito attending the inauguration of U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt.\nAlito has also dissented from the opinions of the Court's conservative justices on free speech cases, one of which, *Snyder v. Phelps*, had to do with Westboro Baptist Church members' right to protest a military funeral.[84] Alito offered the sole dissenting opinion, saying protesters \"were sued under a very well-established tort that goes back to the 19th century, the intentional infliction of emotional, of severe emotional distress. And I thought that this tort constituted a reasonable exception to the First Amendment, but my colleagues disagreed about that.\"[85]\n\n\nIn the 2007 landmark free speech case *Morse v. Frederick*, Alito joined Roberts's majority decision that speech advocating drug use can be banned in public schools, but also warned that the ruling must be circumscribed so as not to interfere with political speech, such as discussion of the medical marijuana debate.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAlito's confirmation hearing was held from January 9 to 13, 2006. Two active-duty members of the Third Circuit, Judge Maryanne Trump Barry and Chief Judge Anthony J. Scirica, testified in Alito's confirmation hearing, as did five senior and retired circuit judges.[40] Alito responded to some 700 questions over 18 hours of testimony. He rejected the use of foreign legal materials in the Constitution, did not state a position on cameras in courtrooms (he had supported them while on the 3rd Circuit), said Congress could choose to outlaw LGBT employment discrimination in the United States if it wished, and told then-Senator Joe Biden (D-DE) that he endorsed a weak version of the unitary executive theory.[41]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn May 2, 2022, *Politico* published a leak of a first draft of a majority opinion by Alito that circulated among the justices in February 2022 for the upcoming decision in *Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization*. The opinion would overturn *Roe v. Wade* and *Planned Parenthood v. Casey*, and would likely either severely restrict access to abortion or make it completely illegal in states with trigger laws.[74] On June 24, 2022, the ruling was handed down. It was mostly identical to the leaked draft, with the addition of replies to the dissenting and concurring opinions. Alito wrote that \"*Roe* was egregiously wrong from the start.\"[75] In July 2022, Alito gave his first public comments on the ruling in a keynote address for Notre Dame Law School's Religious Liberty Initiative in Rome. He mocked several foreign leaders for criticizing the decision, particularly U.K. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAlito was born in Trenton, New Jersey. He was the son of Samuel A. Alito Sr., an Italian immigrant from Roccella Ionica, Calabria, and Rose Fradusco, an Italian-American whose parents came from Palazzo San Gervasio in Basilicata.[1][2][3] Alito's father earned a master's degree at Rutgers University and was a high school teacher and later the first director of the New Jersey Office of Legislative Services, a state government position he held from 1952 to 1984. Alito's mother was a schoolteacher. Both are deceased.[4]\n\n\nAlito grew up in Hamilton Township, New Jersey, a suburb of Trenton.[5] He attended Steinert High School, where he graduated in 1968 as the class valedictorian,[6] subsequently matriculating at Princeton University. In 1972, he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts, *summa cum laude*, from the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs.[7] His senior thesis, supervised by political scientist Walter F. Murphy, was entitled \"An Introduction to the Italian Constitutional Court\".[8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter graduating from law school, Alito clerked for Third Circuit appeals judge Leonard I. Garth in Newark, New Jersey, in 1976 and 1977.[15] He interviewed with Supreme Court Justice Byron White for a clerkship but was not hired.[17] Between 1977 and 1981, Alito was Assistant United States Attorney, District of New Jersey.[18] There, he served under the then-chief of the appeals division Assistant U.S. Attorney, Maryanne Trump Barry (Barry later became a federal judge).[19] While an Assistant U.S. Attorney for New Jersey, he prosecuted many cases involving drug trafficking and organized crime.[20]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAt Princeton, Alito was \"almost alone\" in his familiarity with the writings of John Marshall Harlan II[14] and was much influenced by the course on constitutional interpretation taught by Walter F. Murphy, also his faculty adviser.[14] During his senior year at Princeton, Alito moved out of New Jersey for the first time to study in Italy, where he wrote his thesis on the Italian legal system.[15] Graduating in 1972, Alito left a sign of his lofty aspirations in his yearbook, which said that he hoped to \"eventually warm a seat on the Supreme Court\".[16]\n\n\nAlito then attended Yale Law School, where he served as an editor of the *Yale Law Journal* and earned a Juris Doctor in 1975.[7]\n\n\n\n## Early legal career[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) formally opposed Alito's nomination to the Supreme Court. The ACLU has only taken this step three other times in its entire history, opposing the nominations of William Rehnquist, Robert Bork and Brett Kavanaugh.[44][*better source needed*] In releasing its report[45][*better source needed*] on Alito, ACLU Executive Director Anthony Romero said, \"At a time when our president has claimed unprecedented authority to spy on Americans and jail terrorism suspects indefinitely, America needs a Supreme Court justice who will uphold our precious civil liberties. Alito's record shows a willingness to support government actions that abridge individual freedoms.\"[46][*better source needed*]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFrom 1985 to 1987, Alito was Deputy Assistant Attorney General under Charles J. Cooper in the Office of Legal Counsel during the tenure of Attorney General Edwin Meese. John F. Manning worked under Alito there.[11] Between 1986 and 1987, Alito authored nearly 470 pages of memoranda, in which he argued for expanding his client's law enforcement and personnel authorities.[24] In his 1985 application for Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Alito espoused conservative views, naming William F. Buckley, Jr., the *National Review*, Alexander Bickel, and Barry Goldwater's 1964 presidential campaign as major influences. He also expressed concern about Warren Court decisions in the areas of criminal procedure, the Establishment Clause, and reapportionment.[25]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n### Nomination and confirmation[edit]\n\n\nThird Circuit Judges Leonard I. Garth, for whom Alito clerked, and Maryanne Trump Barry, under whom Alito worked as an assistant U.S. Attorney, recommended Alito's judicial nomination to President George H. W. Bush.[19] On February 20, 1990, Bush nominated Alito to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, to a seat vacated by John Joseph Gibbons. The American Bar Association rated Alito \"Well Qualified\" at the time of his nomination. He was confirmed by unanimous consent in the Senate on April 27, 1990,[33][34] and received his commission three days later. As a Third Circuit judge, his chambers were in Newark, New Jersey.[15]\n\n\n\n### Notable opinions[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Legal Memo written while working in the United States Solicitor General's office regarding the Fleeing felon rule.

Democratic Senators characterized Alito as a hard-right conservative in the mold of Clarence Thomas or Robert Bork. Alito professed reluctance to commit to any type of ideology, stating he would act as an impartial referee. He said he would look at abortion with an open mind but would not state how he would rule on *Roe v. Wade* if that decision were to be challenged. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHobby Lobby* weeks before the June 2014 decision, authored by Alito and favorable to anti-abortion conservatives, was officially announced.[80] Schenck claimed to have heard of the outcome from Gayle Wright, a conservative donor, shortly after she and her husband had lunch with Alito and his wife on June 3, 2014.[80] *The New York Times* claims contemporaneous emails written by Schenck \"strongly suggested he knew the outcome and the author of the Hobby Lobby decision before it was made public.\"[80] In a statement, Alito denied having revealed the outcome or authorship of any decision before its official announcement, but did not dispute that the June 3 lunch with Wright had occurred.[80]\n\n\nOn April 21, 2023, Alito dissented when the Supreme Court reversed a ruling by Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk that would have banned mifepristone (one of two medications used in the emergency contraception medication Plan B) nationwide.[81][82][83]\n\n\n\n#### Free speech jurisprudence[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n104. **^** Journal, A.

After a failed filibuster attempt by Senator John Kerry, the Senate confirmed Alito to the Supreme Court on January 31 by a vote of 58–42.[47] All Senate Republicans voted in favor of confirmation except Lincoln Chafee, and all Senate Democrats voted against confirmation except Tim Johnson, Robert Byrd, Kent Conrad, and Ben Nelson. An Independent, Jim Jeffords, voted against confirmation.[48][49] Alito was sworn in as an associate justice of the Supreme Court later that day.[50][51] He became the 110th justice, the second Italian-American,[52][53] the 11th Catholic in the history of the Supreme Court, and the fifth Catholic on the Court at the time he assumed office.[54]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe *ProPublica* report on unreported gifts to both Alito and Thomas led several Democratic members of Congress to call for ethics reform for the Supreme Court. This included a Senate Judiciary Committee proposal to establish a code of ethics for the Court.[92] In a July 2023 *Wall Street Journal* opinion column, Alito wrote, \"Congress did not create the Supreme Court [...] I know this is a controversial view, but I'm willing to say it. No provision in the Constitution gives them the authority to regulate the Supreme Court—period.\"[93] This declaration led to further debate among Democratic lawmakers. Senator Chris Murphy asserted that the Constitution gives Congress power to oversee the Court: \"It is just wrong on the facts to say that Congress doesn't have anything to do with the rules guiding the Supreme Court. In fact, from the very beginning, Congress has set those rules.\"[94]\n\n\n\n## Teaching[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Samuel A.

Justices Roberts, Scalia and Thomas were in favor of vacating the stay; Missouri had twice asked the justices to lift the stay and permit the execution.[61] Moreover, despite having been at one time nicknamed \"Scalito\", Alito's views have differed from those of Scalia (and Thomas), as in the Michael Taylor case and various other cases of the 2005 term.[*original research?*] A fierce critic of reliance on legislative history in statutory interpretation,[*citation needed*] Scalia was the only member of the Court in *Zedner v. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn his first term, Alito compiled a fairly conservative record.[*original research?*] For example, in the three reargued cases (*Garcetti v. Ceballos*, *Hudson v. Michigan* and *Kansas v. Marsh*), Alito created a 5–4 majority by voting with the four other conservative Justices – Chief Justice John G. Roberts and Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy, and Clarence Thomas. He further voted with the conservative wing of the court on *Sanchez-Llamas v. Oregon*[55] and *Rapanos v. United States*. Alito also dissented in *Hamdan v.

Carhart*. The Court had previously ruled in *Stenberg v. Carhart* that a state's ban on partial birth abortion was unconstitutional because such a ban did not have an exception in the case of a threat to the health of the mother. The membership of the Court changed after *Stenberg*, with Roberts and Alito replacing Rehnquist (a dissenter in *Roe*) and O'Connor (a supporter of *Roe*) respectively. Further, the ban at issue in *Gonzales v. Carhart* was a federal statute, rather than a state statute as in the *Stenberg* case.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n83. **^** \"22a901\\_3d9g.pdf\" (PDF). *supremecourt.gov*. April 21, 2023.

In two higher-profile cases, one involving the constitutionality of political gerrymandering and one involving campaign finance reform (*LULAC v. Perry* and *Randall v. Sorrell*), Alito adopted narrow positions, declining to join the bolder positions advanced by either philosophical side of the Court.[*original research?*] According to a SCOTUSblog analysis of 2005 term decisions, Alito and Scalia concurred in the result of 86% of decisions in which both participated, and concurred in full in 75%.[62] Alito also differed from Scalia in applying originalism flexibly to arrive at conservative outcomes \"with plodding consistency\", rather than following it so strictly as to occasionally produce outcomes unfavorable to conservatives.[63]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBecause Alito joined the Court mid-term, he did not participate in the decisions of most of the early cases in the Court term because he had not heard arguments for them. These decisions were released with an 8-member Court; none were 4–4, so Alito would not have been the deciding vote in any of them if he had participated. Only three of these cases  – *Garcetti v. Ceballos*, *Hudson v. Michigan*, and *Kansas v. Marsh*  – were reargued since a tie needed to be broken.\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn April 18, 2007, the Supreme Court handed down a decision ruling the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act constitutional. Kennedy wrote for the five-justice majority that Congress was within its power to generally ban the procedure, although the Court left open the door for as-applied challenges. Kennedy said that the challenged statute was consistent with the Court's prior decisions in *Roe v. Wade*, *Planned Parenthood v. Casey*, and *Stenberg v. Carhart*.\n\n\nAlito joined fully in the majority, as did Roberts. Thomas filed a concurring opinion, joined by Scalia, contending that the Court's prior decisions in *Roe v. Wade* and *Planned Parenthood v. Casey* should be reversed, and also noting that the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act may exceed the powers of Congress under the Commerce Clause. Alito, Roberts, and Kennedy did not join that assertion. Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, David Souter, Stephen Breyer, and John Paul Stevens dissented, contending that the ruling ignored Supreme Court abortion precedent.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAlito delivered his first written Supreme Court opinion on May 1, 2006, in *Holmes v. South Carolina*, a case involving the right of criminal defendants to present evidence that a third party committed the crime. From the beginning of the Rehnquist Court to the nomination of Justice Elena Kagan, each new justice has been given a unanimous opinion to write as their first Supreme Court opinion; this practice is designed to help \"break in\" new justices so that each justice has at least one unanimous, uncontroversial opinion under their belt.[*original research?*] Alito wrote for a unanimous court in ordering a new trial for Bobby Lee Holmes due to South Carolina's rule that barred such evidence based on the strength of the prosecution's case, rather than on the relevance and strength of the defense evidence itself. His other majority opinions in his first term were in *Zedner v. United States*, *Woodford v. Ngo*, and *Arlington Central School District Board of Education v. Murphy*.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAlito was raised in Hamilton Township, New Jersey, and was educated at Princeton University and Yale Law School. After graduating from law school, he worked as an assistant attorney general for the Office of Legal Counsel and served as the U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey. In 1990, Alito was appointed as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, where he served until joining the Supreme Court. He has called himself a \"practical originalist\" and has been described as one of the Court's \"most conservative justices\".\n\n\nAlito wrote the majority opinion in *Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization* (2022), in which the Supreme Court overturned its 1973 abortion rights decision *Roe v. Wade*. He has also written majority opinions in the landmark cases *McDonald v. Chicago*, *Burwell v. Hobby Lobby*, *Murphy v. NCAA*, and *Janus v.

Scirica, testified in Alito's confirmation hearing, as did five senior and retired circuit judges.[40] Alito responded to some 700 questions over 18 hours of testimony. He rejected the use of foreign legal materials in the Constitution, did not state a position on cameras in courtrooms (he had supported them while on the 3rd Circuit), said Congress could choose to outlaw LGBT employment discrimination in the United States if it wished, and told then-Senator Joe Biden (D-DE) that he endorsed a weak version of the unitary executive theory.[41]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn May 2, 2022, *Politico* published a leak of a first draft of a majority opinion by Alito that circulated among the justices in February 2022 for the upcoming decision in *Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization*. The opinion would overturn *Roe v. Wade* and *Planned Parenthood v. Casey*, and would likely either severely restrict access to abortion or make it completely illegal in states with trigger laws.[74] On June 24, 2022, the ruling was handed down. It was mostly identical to the leaked draft, with the addition of replies to the dissenting and concurring opinions. Alito wrote that \"*Roe* was egregiously wrong from the start.\"[75] In July 2022, Alito gave his first public comments on the ruling in a keynote address for Notre Dame Law School's Religious Liberty Initiative in Rome. He mocked several foreign leaders for criticizing the decision, particularly U.K. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAlito was born in Trenton, New Jersey. He was the son of Samuel A. Alito Sr., an Italian immigrant from Roccella Ionica, Calabria, and Rose Fradusco, an Italian-American whose parents came from Palazzo San Gervasio in Basilicata.[1][2][3] Alito's father earned a master's degree at Rutgers University and was a high school teacher and later the first director of the New Jersey Office of Legislative Services, a state government position he held from 1952 to 1984. Alito's mother was a schoolteacher. Both are deceased.[4]\n\n\nAlito grew up in Hamilton Township, New Jersey, a suburb of Trenton.[5] He attended Steinert High School, where he graduated in 1968 as the class valedictorian,[6] subsequently matriculating at Princeton University. In 1972, he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts, *summa cum laude*, from the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs.[7] His senior thesis, supervised by political scientist Walter F. Murphy, was entitled \"An Introduction to the Italian Constitutional Court\".[8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter graduating from law school, Alito clerked for Third Circuit appeals judge Leonard I. Garth in Newark, New Jersey, in 1976 and 1977.[15] He interviewed with Supreme Court Justice Byron White for a clerkship but was not hired.[17] Between 1977 and 1981, Alito was Assistant United States Attorney, District of New Jersey.[18] There, he served under the then-chief of the appeals division Assistant U.S. Attorney, Maryanne Trump Barry (Barry later became a federal judge).[19] While an Assistant U.S. Attorney for New Jersey, he prosecuted many cases involving drug trafficking and organized crime.[20]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAt Princeton, Alito was \"almost alone\" in his familiarity with the writings of John Marshall Harlan II[14] and was much influenced by the course on constitutional interpretation taught by Walter F. Murphy, also his faculty adviser.[14] During his senior year at Princeton, Alito moved out of New Jersey for the first time to study in Italy, where he wrote his thesis on the Italian legal system.[15] Graduating in 1972, Alito left a sign of his lofty aspirations in his yearbook, which said that he hoped to \"eventually warm a seat on the Supreme Court\".[16]\n\n\nAlito then attended Yale Law School, where he served as an editor of the *Yale Law Journal* and earned a Juris Doctor in 1975.[7]\n\n\n\n## Early legal career[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) formally opposed Alito's nomination to the Supreme Court. The ACLU has only taken this step three other times in its entire history, opposing the nominations of William Rehnquist, Robert Bork and Brett Kavanaugh.[44][*better source needed*] In releasing its report[45][*better source needed*] on Alito, ACLU Executive Director Anthony Romero said, \"At a time when our president has claimed unprecedented authority to spy on Americans and jail terrorism suspects indefinitely, America needs a Supreme Court justice who will uphold our precious civil liberties. Alito's record shows a willingness to support government actions that abridge individual freedoms.\"[46][*better source needed*]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFrom 1985 to 1987, Alito was Deputy Assistant Attorney General under Charles J. Cooper in the Office of Legal Counsel during the tenure of Attorney General Edwin Meese. John F. Manning worked under Alito there.[11] Between 1986 and 1987, Alito authored nearly 470 pages of memoranda, in which he argued for expanding his client's law enforcement and personnel authorities.[24] In his 1985 application for Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Alito espoused conservative views, naming William F. Buckley, Jr., the *National Review*, Alexander Bickel, and Barry Goldwater's 1964 presidential campaign as major influences. He also expressed concern about Warren Court decisions in the areas of criminal procedure, the Establishment Clause, and reapportionment.[25]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n### Nomination and confirmation[edit]\n\n\nThird Circuit Judges Leonard I. Garth, for whom Alito clerked, and Maryanne Trump Barry, under whom Alito worked as an assistant U.S. Attorney, recommended Alito's judicial nomination to President George H. W. Bush.[19] On February 20, 1990, Bush nominated Alito to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, to a seat vacated by John Joseph Gibbons. The American Bar Association rated Alito \"Well Qualified\" at the time of his nomination. He was confirmed by unanimous consent in the Senate on April 27, 1990,[33][34] and received his commission three days later. As a Third Circuit judge, his chambers were in Newark, New Jersey.[15]\n\n\n\n### Notable opinions[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Legal Memo written while working in the United States Solicitor General's office regarding the Fleeing felon rule.

Democratic Senators characterized Alito as a hard-right conservative in the mold of Clarence Thomas or Robert Bork. Alito professed reluctance to commit to any type of ideology, stating he would act as an impartial referee. He said he would look at abortion with an open mind but would not state how he would rule on *Roe v. Wade* if that decision were to be challenged. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHobby Lobby* weeks before the June 2014 decision, authored by Alito and favorable to anti-abortion conservatives, was officially announced.[80] Schenck claimed to have heard of the outcome from Gayle Wright, a conservative donor, shortly after she and her husband had lunch with Alito and his wife on June 3, 2014.[80] *The New York Times* claims contemporaneous emails written by Schenck \"strongly suggested he knew the outcome and the author of the Hobby Lobby decision before it was made public.\"[80] In a statement, Alito denied having revealed the outcome or authorship of any decision before its official announcement, but did not dispute that the June 3 lunch with Wright had occurred.[80]\n\n\nOn April 21, 2023, Alito dissented when the Supreme Court reversed a ruling by Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk that would have banned mifepristone (one of two medications used in the emergency contraception medication Plan B) nationwide.[81][82][83]\n\n\n\n#### Free speech jurisprudence[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n104. **^** Journal, A.

Wesley said that his interactions with Sotomayor had been \"totally antithetical to this perception that has gotten some traction that she is somehow confrontational.\"[133] Second Circuit Judge and former teacher Guido Calabresi said his tracking showed that Sotomayor's questioning patterns were no different from those of other members of the court and added, \"Some lawyers just don't like to be questioned by a woman. [The criticism] was sexist, plain and simple.\"[133]\nSotomayor's law clerks regarded her as a valuable and strong mentor, and she said that she viewed them like family.[51]\n\n\nIn 2005, Senate Democrats suggested Sotomayor, among others, to President George W.

California* (holding that a child's age \"would have affected how a reasonable person\" would \"perceive his or her freedom to leave\") and *Yarborough v. Alvarado* (holding that a child's age \"generates commonsense conclusions about behavior and perception\"). Sotomayor also pointed out that the law recognizes that a child's judgment is not the same as an adult's, in the form of legal disqualifications on children as a class (*e.g.*, limitations on a child's ability to marry without parental consent). Associate Justice Samuel Alito, jointed by three other justices, wrote a dissenting opinion.\n\n\n\n#### Stolen Valor Act[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThere have been some deviations from the ideological pattern. In a 2013 book on the Roberts Court, author Marcia Coyle assessed Sotomayor's position on the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment as a strong guarantee of the right of a defendant to confront his or her accusers.[223] Sotomayor's judicial philosophy on the issue is seen as being in parity with Elena Kagan and, unexpectedly for Sotomayor, also in at least partial agreement with the originalist reading of Antonin Scalia when applied to the clause.\n\n\nOn January 20 and 21, 2013, Sotomayor administered the oath to Vice President Joe Biden for the inauguration of his second term. Sotomayor became the first Hispanic and fourth woman to administer the oath to a president or vice president.[228] On January 20, 2021, Sotomayor administered the oath of office to Kamala Harris for her inauguration as vice president, the first woman to ever hold the office.[229]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2020, Justice Sotomayor was reportedly targeted by the same gunman, an angry lawyer, who entered U.S. District Court Judge Esther Salas's home, shooting her husband and killing her son. The gunman had subsequently killed himself, after which his detailed planning notes regarding Sotomayor were found.[271]\n\n\nIn January 2021, Sonia Sotomayor swore in Kamala Harris as the Vice President of the United States. It was considered historic as Sotomayor is the first woman of color to serve on the Supreme Court and Harris is the first woman, African-American, and Asian-American Vice President.[272]\n\n\n\n## Awards and honors[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n73. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** Sloan, Karen (May 27, 2009). \"Nominee's civil practice was with a small, but specialized, firm\". *The National Law Journal*.

Her nomination was confirmed by the Senate in August 2009 by a vote of 68–31. While on the Court, Sotomayor has supported the informal liberal bloc of justices when they divide along the commonly perceived ideological lines. During her Supreme Court tenure, Sotomayor has been identified with concern for the rights of defendants and criminal justice reform, and is known for her impassioned dissents on issues of race, ethnic, and gender identity, including in *Schuette v. BAMN*, *Utah v. Strieff*, and *Trump v. Hawaii*.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nSotomayor[5] was born in the New York City borough of the Bronx.[6] Her father was Juan Sotomayor (c. 1921–1964),[7] from the area of Santurce, San Juan, Puerto Rico,[8][9][10] and her mother was Celina Báez (1927–2021),[11] an orphan[12] from Santa Rosa in Lajas, a rural area on Puerto Rico's southwest coast.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n​\n ​\n(m. 1976; div. 1983)​\n |\n| Education | * Princeton University (BA)\n* Yale University (JD)\n |\n| Signature | ![Cursive signature in ink](image) |\n| Sonia Sotomayor's voice\n\n\nSonia Sotomayor's opening statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee on her nomination to the Supreme CourtRecorded July 13, 2009\n |\n|  |\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n11. **^** Cave, Damien (May 29, 2009). \"In Puerto Rico, Supreme Court Pick With Island Roots Becomes a Superstar\". *The New York Times*.

Hobby Lobby*, in which the conservative bloc had prevailed, was opposed by the court's three female members: Sotomayor, Ginsburg and Kagan. Writing in dissent, Sotomayor wrote that the case was at odds with the majority's previous statements in *Hobby Lobby* and said, \"Those who are bound by our decisions usually believe they can take us at our word ...

The empathy to understand what it's like to be poor, or African-American, or gay, or disabled, or old.\"[177]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"268ccea0-d6f9-418d-b3e6-2d3aefa92edf","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

However, there is a wide divergence among Catholics in general in their approaches to the law.[3] Due to her upbringing and her past jobs and positions, Sotomayor has brought one of the more diverse sets of life experiences to the Court.[227]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n116. **^** Biskupic, Joan (July 19, 2005). \"The next president could tip high court\". *USA Today*.

California* (holding that a child's age \"would have affected how a reasonable person\" would \"perceive his or her freedom to leave\") and *Yarborough v. Alvarado* (holding that a child's age \"generates commonsense conclusions about behavior and perception\"). Sotomayor also pointed out that the law recognizes that a child's judgment is not the same as an adult's, in the form of legal disqualifications on children as a class (*e.g.*, limitations on a child's ability to marry without parental consent).

In a 2013 book on the Roberts Court, author Marcia Coyle assessed Sotomayor's position on the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment as a strong guarantee of the right of a defendant to confront his or her accusers.[223] Sotomayor's judicial philosophy on the issue is seen as being in parity with Elena Kagan and, unexpectedly for Sotomayor, also in at least partial agreement with the originalist reading of Antonin Scalia when applied to the clause.\n\n\nOn January 20 and 21, 2013, Sotomayor administered the oath to Vice President Joe Biden for the inauguration of his second term. Sotomayor became the first Hispanic and fourth woman to administer the oath to a president or vice president.[228] On January 20, 2021, Sotomayor administered the oath of office to Kamala Harris for her inauguration as vice president, the first woman to ever hold the office.[229]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2020, Justice Sotomayor was reportedly targeted by the same gunman, an angry lawyer, who entered U.S. District Court Judge Esther Salas's home, shooting her husband and killing her son. The gunman had subsequently killed himself, after which his detailed planning notes regarding Sotomayor were found.[271]\n\n\nIn January 2021, Sonia Sotomayor swore in Kamala Harris as the Vice President of the United States. It was considered historic as Sotomayor is the first woman of color to serve on the Supreme Court and Harris is the first woman, African-American, and Asian-American Vice President.[272]\n\n\n\n## Awards and honors[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n73. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** Sloan, Karen (May 27, 2009). \"Nominee's civil practice was with a small, but specialized, firm\". *The National Law Journal*.

Hawaii*.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nSotomayor[5] was born in the New York City borough of the Bronx.[6] Her father was Juan Sotomayor (c. 1921–1964),[7] from the area of Santurce, San Juan, Puerto Rico,[8][9][10] and her mother was Celina Báez (1927–2021),[11] an orphan[12] from Santa Rosa in Lajas, a rural area on Puerto Rico's southwest coast.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n​\n ​\n(m. 1976; div. 1983)​\n |\n| Education | * Princeton University (BA)\n* Yale University (JD)\n |\n| Signature | ![Cursive signature in ink](image) |\n| Sonia Sotomayor's voice\n\n\nSonia Sotomayor's opening statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee on her nomination to the Supreme CourtRecorded July 13, 2009\n |\n|  |\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n11. **^** Cave, Damien (May 29, 2009). \"In Puerto Rico, Supreme Court Pick With Island Roots Becomes a Superstar\". *The New York Times*.

Hobby Lobby*, in which the conservative bloc had prevailed, was opposed by the court's three female members: Sotomayor, Ginsburg and Kagan. Writing in dissent, Sotomayor wrote that the case was at odds with the majority's previous statements in *Hobby Lobby* and said, \"Those who are bound by our decisions usually believe they can take us at our word ... Not today.\" Sotomayor stated further her opinion that the decision risked depriving \"hundreds of Wheaton's employees and students of their legal entitlement to contraceptive coverage.\"[243]\n\n\n\n#### Immigration[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nwriting that \"she's not nearly as smart as she seems to think she is,\" and that \"her reputation for being something of a bully could well make her liberal impulses backfire and simply add to the fire power of the Roberts/Alito/Scalia/Thomas wing of the court.\"[171][172][173]\n\n\nOn May 25, Obama informed Sotomayor of his choice; she later said, \"I had my [hand] over my chest, trying to calm my beating heart, literally.\"[174] On May 26, 2009, Obama nominated her.[175] She became only the second jurist to be nominated to three different judicial positions by three different presidents.[176] The selection appeared to closely match Obama's presidential campaign promise that he would nominate judges who had \"the heart, the empathy, to recognize what it's like to be a teenage mom. The empathy to understand what it's like to be poor, or African-American, or gay, or disabled, or old.\"[177]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"268ccea0-d6f9-418d-b3e6-2d3aefa92edf","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

She was nominated by President Barack Obama on May 10, 2010, and has served since August 7, 2010. Kagan is the fourth woman to become a member of the Court.\n\n\nKagan was born and raised in New York City. After graduating from Princeton University, Worcester College, Oxford, and Harvard Law School, she clerked for a federal Court of Appeals judge and for Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall. She began her career as a professor at the University of Chicago Law School, leaving to serve as Associate White House Counsel, and later as a policy adviser under President Bill Clinton. After a nomination to the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, which expired without action, she became a professor at Harvard Law School and was later named its first female dean.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2009, Kagan became the first female solicitor general of the United States.[5] The following year, President Obama nominated her to the Supreme Court to fill the vacancy arising from the impending retirement of Justice John Paul Stevens. The United States Senate confirmed her nomination by a vote of 63–37. As of 2022, she is the most recent justice appointed without any prior judicial experience. She is considered part of the Court's liberal wing, but tends to be its most moderate justice. She has written the majority opinion in some landmark cases, such as *Cooper v. Harris*, *Chiafalo v. Washington*, and *Kisor v. Wilkie*, as well as several notable dissenting opinions, such as in *Rucho v. Common Cause*, *West Virginia v. EPA*, *Brnovich v. DNC*, *Janus v. AFSCME*, and *Seila Law v.

Kagan initially offered to go hunting with Risch before promising instead to go hunting with Scalia if confirmed. According to Kagan, Scalia laughed when she told him of the promise and took her to his hunting club for the first of several hunting trips.[156] Kagan is known to spend time with longtime friends from law school and her stint in the Clinton administration rather than attending Washington, D.C., social events she is invited to as a justice.[155]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Education | Princeton University (BA)Worcester College, Oxford (MPhil)Harvard University (JD) |\n| Signature | ![Cursive signature in ink](image) |\n| Elena Kagan's voice\n\n\nElena Kagan's opening statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee on her nomination to the Supreme CourtRecorded June 28, 2010\n |\n|  |\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nYet the Court today prevents congressionally authorized agency action to curb power plants' carbon dioxide emissions.

She wrote only majority opinions or dissents that more senior justices assigned to her, and in which she and a group of justices agreed upon a rationale for deciding the case. This tendency to write for a group rather than herself made it difficult to discern her own views or where she might lean in future cases.[140] She wrote the fewest opinions for the terms from 2011 through 2014, tying with Kennedy in 2011 and 2013.[141]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n92. **^** Goldstein, Amy (June 15, 2010). \"69 law school deans endorse Kagan in letter to Senate\". *The Washington Post*.

On August 5 the full Senate confirmed her nomination by a vote of 63–37.[99] The voting was largely along party lines, with five Republicans (Richard Lugar, Judd Gregg, Lindsey Graham, Susan Collins, and Olympia Snowe) supporting her and one Democrat (Ben Nelson) opposing.[100]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n67. **^** \"Obama names Jewish woman as solicitor general\".

She became one of Mikva's favorite clerks; he called her \"the pick of the litter\".[33] From 1988 to 1989, Kagan clerked for justice Thurgood Marshall of the U.S. Supreme Court. Marshall said he hired Kagan to help him put the \"spark\" back into his opinions as the Court had been undergoing a conservative shift since William Rehnquist became Chief Justice in 1986.[34] Marshall nicknamed the 5-foot-3-inch (1.60-metre) Kagan \"Shorty\".[12]\n\n\nFrom 1989 to 1991, Kagan was in private practice at the Washington, D.C., law firm Williams & Connolly.[35] As a junior associate, she drafted briefs and conducted discovery.[36] During her short time at the firm, she handled five lawsuits that involved First Amendment or media law issues and libel issues.[37]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nKagan's confirmation hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee began on June 28.[93] As they began, Kagan was expected to be confirmed, with Senator John Cornyn calling her \"justice-to-be\".[94] During the hearings, she demonstrated a deep knowledge of Supreme Court cases, expounding upon cases senators mentioned in their questions to her without taking notes on the questions. A number of Democratic senators criticized recent decisions of the court as \"activist\", but Kagan avoided joining in their criticisms.[95] Like many prior nominees, including Chief Justice John Roberts, she declined to answer whether she thought particular cases were correctly decided or how she would vote on particular issues.[95][96] Senators Jon Kyl and Arlen Specter[d] criticized her evasiveness. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n78. **^** Mears, Bill (June 27, 2010). \"Kagan: Campaign finance reform proved a major defeat\".

City of St. Paul*;[41] an article discussing the significance of governmental motive in regulating speech;[42] and a review of a book by Stephen L.

She was nominated by President Barack Obama on May 10, 2010, and has served since August 7, 2010. Kagan is the fourth woman to become a member of the Court.\n\n\nKagan was born and raised in New York City. After graduating from Princeton University, Worcester College, Oxford, and Harvard Law School, she clerked for a federal Court of Appeals judge and for Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall. She began her career as a professor at the University of Chicago Law School, leaving to serve as Associate White House Counsel, and later as a policy adviser under President Bill Clinton. After a nomination to the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, which expired without action, she became a professor at Harvard Law School and was later named its first female dean.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2009, Kagan became the first female solicitor general of the United States.[5] The following year, President Obama nominated her to the Supreme Court to fill the vacancy arising from the impending retirement of Justice John Paul Stevens. The United States Senate confirmed her nomination by a vote of 63–37. As of 2022, she is the most recent justice appointed without any prior judicial experience. She is considered part of the Court's liberal wing, but tends to be its most moderate justice. She has written the majority opinion in some landmark cases, such as *Cooper v. Harris*, *Chiafalo v. Washington*, and *Kisor v. Wilkie*, as well as several notable dissenting opinions, such as in *Rucho v. Common Cause*, *West Virginia v. EPA*, *Brnovich v. DNC*, *Janus v. AFSCME*, and *Seila Law v.

(O'Connor is not wearing a robe because she had retired before the picture was taken).\nLike other justices, Kagan makes public appearances when she is not hearing cases.[145] In her first four years on the Court, she made at least 20 public appearances.[146] Kagan tends to choose speaking engagements that allow her to speak to students.[145]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n*Time* magazine named Kagan one of its Time 100 most influential people for 2013. Former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote the article on Kagan, calling her \"an incisive legal thinker\" and \"excellent communicator\".[147] That same year, a painting of the four women to have served as Supreme Court justices, Kagan, Sotomayor, Ginsburg, and O'Connor, was unveiled at the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C.[148] In 2018, Kagan received the Marshall-Wythe Medallion from William & Mary Law School,[149] and an honorary degree of Doctor of Humane Letters from Hunter College.[150]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nKagan has never married. During her confirmation, a photo of her playing softball, which is sometimes characterized in popular culture as unfeminine, led to unsubstantiated claims that Kagan was a lesbian.[151] Her friends have criticized the rumors. Kagan's law school roommate Sarah Walzer said, \"I've known her for most of her adult life and I know she's straight.\"[152]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n117. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Court issues new circuit assignments\". *SCOTUSblog*.

It lauded what it called her coalition-building skills and \"understanding of both doctrine and policy\" as well as her written record of legal analysis.[92]\n\n\n\n#### Confirmation hearings[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIdeologically, Kagan is part of the Supreme Court's liberal wing:[108][109][110] she voted with the liberal bloc in *King v. Burwell*, 576 U.S. 988 (2015), finding that Obamacare's subsidies and individual mandate are constitutional, and in *Obergefell v. Hodges*, 576 U.S. 644 (2015), which prohibits states from outlawing same-sex marriage.[111] In 2018, *Slate* observed that Kagan had crossed ideological lines on multiple cases during the preceding term, and considered her to be part of a centrist bloc along with Justices Roberts, Stephen Breyer, and Anthony Kennedy.[112] Still, *FiveThirtyEight* observed that Kagan voted with her more liberal peers, Ginsburg and Sotomayor, over 90% of the time.[113] Also during the 2017–18 term, Kagan most commonly agreed with Breyer; they voted together in 93% of cases. She agreed least often with Justice Samuel Alito, in 58.82% of cases.[114]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn April 9, 2010, Justice John Paul Stevens announced he would retire at the start of the Court's summer 2010 recess, triggering new speculation about potential replacements, and Kagan was once again considered a contender.[87] In a *Fresh Dialogues* interview, Jeffrey Toobin, a Supreme Court analyst and Kagan's friend and law school classmate,[88] speculated that she would be Obama's nominee, describing her as \"very much an Obama-type person, a moderate Democrat, a consensus builder\".[89] This alarmed some liberals and progressives, who worried that \"replacing Stevens with Kagan risks moving the Court to the right, perhaps substantially to the right\".[90]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Kagan meets with then President Obama in the Oval Office, April 2010, a month before nominating her to the U.S. Supreme Court\nObama nominates Kagan to be an Associate Justice for the United States Supreme Court\nBefore Obama's election, Kagan was the subject of media speculation as a potential Supreme Court nominee if a Democratic president were elected in 2008.[82] Obama had his first Supreme Court vacancy to fill in 2009 when Associate Justice David H. Souter announced his upcoming retirement.[83] Senior Obama adviser David Axelrod later recounted that during the search for a new justice, Antonin Scalia told him he hoped Obama would nominate Kagan, because of her intelligence.[84] On May 13, 2009, the Associated Press reported that Obama was considering Kagan, among others.[85] On May 26, 2009, Obama announced that he had chosen Sonia Sotomayor.[86]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring her 15 months as Solicitor General, Kagan argued six cases before the Supreme Court.[79] *The Washington Post* described her style during argument as \"confident\" and \"conversational\".[74] She helped win four cases: *Salazar v.

Kagan initially offered to go hunting with Risch before promising instead to go hunting with Scalia if confirmed. According to Kagan, Scalia laughed when she told him of the promise and took her to his hunting club for the first of several hunting trips.[156] Kagan is known to spend time with longtime friends from law school and her stint in the Clinton administration rather than attending Washington, D.C., social events she is invited to as a justice.[155]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Education | Princeton University (BA)Worcester College, Oxford (MPhil)Harvard University (JD) |\n| Signature | ![Cursive signature in ink](image) |\n| Elena Kagan's voice\n\n\nElena Kagan's opening statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee on her nomination to the Supreme CourtRecorded June 28, 2010\n |\n|  |\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nYet the Court today prevents congressionally authorized agency action to curb power plants' carbon dioxide emissions.

Respectfully, I dissent.\"[138][139]\n\n\n\n#### Writing style[edit]\n\n\nIn her first term on the Court, Kagan did not write any separate opinions, and wrote the fewest opinions of any justice. She wrote only majority opinions or dissents that more senior justices assigned to her, and in which she and a group of justices agreed upon a rationale for deciding the case. This tendency to write for a group rather than herself made it difficult to discern her own views or where she might lean in future cases.[140] She wrote the fewest opinions for the terms from 2011 through 2014, tying with Kennedy in 2011 and 2013.[141]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n92. **^** Goldstein, Amy (June 15, 2010). \"69 law school deans endorse Kagan in letter to Senate\". *The Washington Post*.

On August 5 the full Senate confirmed her nomination by a vote of 63–37.[99] The voting was largely along party lines, with five Republicans (Richard Lugar, Judd Gregg, Lindsey Graham, Susan Collins, and Olympia Snowe) supporting her and one Democrat (Ben Nelson) opposing.[100]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n67. **^** \"Obama names Jewish woman as solicitor general\".

She became one of Mikva's favorite clerks; he called her \"the pick of the litter\".[33] From 1988 to 1989, Kagan clerked for justice Thurgood Marshall of the U.S. Supreme Court. Marshall said he hired Kagan to help him put the \"spark\" back into his opinions as the Court had been undergoing a conservative shift since William Rehnquist became Chief Justice in 1986.[34] Marshall nicknamed the 5-foot-3-inch (1.60-metre) Kagan \"Shorty\".[12]\n\n\nFrom 1989 to 1991, Kagan was in private practice at the Washington, D.C., law firm Williams & Connolly.[35] As a junior associate, she drafted briefs and conducted discovery.[36] During her short time at the firm, she handled five lawsuits that involved First Amendment or media law issues and libel issues.[37]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nKagan's confirmation hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee began on June 28.[93] As they began, Kagan was expected to be confirmed, with Senator John Cornyn calling her \"justice-to-be\".[94] During the hearings, she demonstrated a deep knowledge of Supreme Court cases, expounding upon cases senators mentioned in their questions to her without taking notes on the questions. A number of Democratic senators criticized recent decisions of the court as \"activist\", but Kagan avoided joining in their criticisms.[95] Like many prior nominees, including Chief Justice John Roberts, she declined to answer whether she thought particular cases were correctly decided or how she would vote on particular issues.[95][96] Senators Jon Kyl and Arlen Specter[d] criticized her evasiveness. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n78. **^** Mears, Bill (June 27, 2010). \"Kagan: Campaign finance reform proved a major defeat\".

City of St. Paul*;[41] an article discussing the significance of governmental motive in regulating speech;[42] and a review of a book by Stephen L. Carter discussing the judicial confirmation process.[43] In the first article, which became highly influential, Kagan argued that the Supreme Court should examine governmental motives when deciding First Amendment cases and analyzed historic draft-card burning and flag burning cases in light of free speech arguments.[44]\n\n\nIn 1993, Senator Joe Biden appointed Kagan as a special counsel for the Senate Judiciary Committee. During this time, she worked on Ruth Bader Ginsburg's Supreme Court confirmation hearings.[45]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn June 17, 1999, Clinton nominated Kagan to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, to replace James L. Buckley, who took senior status in 1996. The Senate Judiciary Committee's Republican Chairman, Orrin Hatch, scheduled no hearing, effectively ending her nomination. When the Senate term ended, her nomination lapsed, as did that of fellow Clinton nominee Allen Snyder.[49][50]\n\n\n\n### Academia[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"eb104856-ef21-44a5-b93f-c6f202fe7de3","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

Gerhardt also found that during the Rehnquist Court's last 11 years, the average number of times a justice called for the overruling of precedent was higher for textualist justices, with one per year coming from Ginsburg (non-textualist) up to just over two per year from Thomas (textualist). \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Amy Coney Barrett; John H.

The letter expressed doubts about her ability to separate faith from her rulings on LGBT matters.[52][53] During her Senate hearing, Barrett was questioned about landmark LGBTQ legal precedents such as *Obergefell v. Hodges*, *United States v. Windsor*, and *Lawrence v. Texas*. She said these cases are \"binding precedents\" that she intended to \"faithfully follow if confirmed\" to the appeals court, as required by law.[52] The letter Lambda Legal co-signed read, \"Simply repeating that she would be bound by Supreme Court precedent does not illuminate—indeed, it obfuscates—how Professor Barrett would interpret and apply precedent when faced with the sorts of dilemmas that, in her view, 'put Catholic judges in a bind.'\"[52]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn May 8, 2017, President Donald Trump nominated Barrett to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit—the federal appellate court covering Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin—after Judge John Daniel Tinder took senior status.[5][40] A Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on her nomination was held on September 6, 2017.[41] During the hearing, Senator Dianne Feinstein questioned Barrett about a law review article Barrett co-wrote in 1998 with Professor John H. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nA petition for rehearing *en banc* was denied, with Chief Judge Wood, joined by Rovner and Hamilton, dissenting.

In 2018, she voted against striking down another Indiana law requiring burial or cremation of fetal remains. In both cases, Barrett voted with the minority.

They included *Brown v. Board of Education* and *Mapp v. Ohio* (incorporating the Fourth Amendment onto the states),[202] but specifically excluded *Roe v. Wade* (1973). In explaining why it was excluded, Barrett referenced scholarship agreeing that in order to qualify as \"superprecedent\", a decision must have widespread support from not only jurists but politicians and the public at large to the extent of becoming immune to reversal or challenge (for example, the constitutionality of paper money). She argued that the people must trust a ruling's validity to such an extent that the matter has been taken \"off of the Court's agenda\", with lower courts no longer taking challenges to them seriously.

Gerhardt also found that during the Rehnquist Court's last 11 years, the average number of times a justice called for the overruling of precedent was higher for textualist justices, with one per year coming from Ginsburg (non-textualist) up to just over two per year from Thomas (textualist). \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Amy Coney Barrett; John H.
