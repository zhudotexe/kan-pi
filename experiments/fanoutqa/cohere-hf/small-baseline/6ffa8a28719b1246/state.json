held on November 7, 2023 to elect the mayor of Philadelphia. Nominees for the Democratic and Republican parties were selected through primaries on May 16, 2023.\n\n\nIncumbent Democratic mayor Jim Kenney was term limited and could not seek reelection to a third term. Philadelphia's three most recent mayors were previously members of Philadelphia City Council who resigned their seats to run for mayor due to the \"resign to run\" provision of Philadelphia's election law. Ed Rendell was the last mayor that did not come from City Council.\n\n\nNotable Democratic candidates included former city councilmembers Allan Domb, Helen Gym, and Cherelle Parker; state representative Amen Brown; former municipal judge James DeLeon; former city controller Rebecca Rhynhart; businessman Jeff Brown; and pastor Warren Bloom Sr. Cherelle Parker won the Democratic primary on September 3 to go on and become the nominee. The Republican nominee is former longtime At-Large City Councilmember David Oh, who ran unopposed in his party's primary.\n\n\nParker was heavily favored in the general election, as Philadelphia has not elected a Republican mayor since 1947. Kenney was re-elected with 80% of the vote in 2019, while Democrat Joe Biden carried the city of Philadelphia with 81% of the vote in 2020.[1]\n\n\n\n\n## Democratic primary[edit]\n\n\n### Background[edit]\n\n\nIn 2019, incumbent Mayor Jim Kenney was re-elected to his second and final term. Polling in March 2022 showed Kenney with a 55% approval rating among Philadelphia Democrats, while an equal percentage said the city was moving in the wrong direction.[2]\n\n\nGun violence and public safety was a top issue in the election.[2][3] While Philadelphia saw 8% fewer homicides in 2022 than in 2021,[4] the city recorded more than 500 homicides for the second year in a row.[5] After a shooting at the city's July 4 celebration, Mayor Kenney told reporters he will \"be happy\" when he is no longer mayor,[6] prompting City Council members Derek S. Green and Allan Domb to call for his resignation.[7]\n\n\nIn August 2022, Allan Domb resigned from City Council ahead of an expected run for mayor but did not announce his candidacy until November of that year.[8][9] In September, Derek Green, Maria Qui\u00f1ones-S\u00e1nchez, and Cherelle Parker also resigned from City Council and announced their candidacies.[10][11][12] City Controller Rebecca Rhynhart joined the race in October, followed by ShopRite retailer Jeff Brown and City Council member Helen Gym in November.[13][14][15] State Representative Amen Brown announced his campaign in December.[16]\n\n\n\n### Candidates[edit]\n\n\n#### Nominee[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Candidate\n | Experience\n | Announced\n | Ref |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)Cherelle Parker | **Philadelphia City Councilmember for the 9th district (2016\u20132022)**Pennsylvania state representative for the 200th district (2005\u20132015)\n | September 7, 2022![](image)Website | [12] |\n\n\n#### Eliminated in primary[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Candidate\n | Experience\n | Announced\n | Ref |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)Warren Bloom Sr.\n | **Pastor**Acting Committeemember from Ward 6, Division 5 (2021)\n | December 2, 2022![](image)Website | [17] |\n| ![](image)Amen Brown | **Pennsylvania state representative for the 10th district (2021\u2013present)**\n | December 16, 2022![](image)Website | [16] |\n| ![](image)Jeff Brown\n | **Businessman**Owner of several ShopRite locations\n | November 16, 2022![](image)Website | [14] |\n| ![](image)James DeLeon\n | **Philadelphia Municipal Judge (1984\u20132021)** | November 22, 2022![](image)Website | [18] |\n| ![](image)Allan Domb | **At-large Philadelphia City Councilmember (2016\u20132022)**Real estate developer\n | November 15, 2022![](image)Website | [9] |\n| ![](image)Helen Gym | **At-large Philadelphia City Councilmember (2016\u20132022)** | November 30, 2022![](image)Website | [19] |\n| ![](image)Rebecca Rhynhart | **Philadelphia City Controller (2018\u20132022)**\n | October 25, 2022![](image)Website | [13] |\n\n\n#### Other declared candidates[edit]\n\n\n* Delscia Gray[20]\n\n\n![](image)\nPhiladelphia city councilmember Maria Qui\u00f1ones-S\u00e1nchez dropped out, citing the \"obnoxious, obscene amount of money that is shaping the race.\"\n![](image)\nPhiladelphia city councilmember, Derek S.

The ads highlight his work opening grocery stores in \"underserved communities\" and accuses his rivals from City Council of inaction.[41] This coincided with Brown receiving endorsements from some of Philadelphia's most powerful labor unions including the chapters of the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, Transport Workers Union of America and United Food and Commercial Workers.[42] Brown faced controversy when he aired an ad that showed an old clip of former First Lady Michelle Obama praising him. An advisor to Obama said that she does not get involved in Democratic primaries and criticized the ad for implying that she had endorsed Brown.[43]\n\n\nCampaign finance reports, released in early April, showed Allan Domb and Jeff Brown as having raised the most money of the candidates.[44] The report showed that Domb had raised $2.6 million, with a $2 million being self-financed. In comparison, Brown raised $2 million with $800,000 being self-financed.[44] The report also showed that more than half of the money donated came from outside of Philadelphia. Only Parker and Rhynhart raised a majority of their funds from Philadelphia donors.[45]\n\n\nLongtime city councilmember Maria Qui\u00f1ones-S\u00e1nchez was originally a candidate,[24] but withdrew on April 10, citing an \"obnoxious, obscene amount of money that is shaping the race.\"[24] Qui\u00f1ones-S\u00e1nchez failed to win the endorsement of any labor unions and her $800,000 in campaign funds paled in comparison to other candidates in the race, who were primarily self-funding their campaigns.[24]\n\n\nOn April 10, The Philadelphia Board of Ethics sued \"For A Better Philadelphia\", a super PAC and nonprofit, by the same name, supporting Jeff Brown's candidacy.[46] The Board of Ethics investigation found an \"extensive and elaborate scheme to circumvent the city's campaign contribution limits.\"[46] In addition, the Board of Ethics said that Brown engaged in fundraising for \"For A Better Philadelphia\" by directing donors to give to the outside spending group.[46] If Brown coordinated with the PAC, then the PAC's spending would be subject to the city's limits on political donations.[46] The Philadelphia Board of Ethics asked a judge to issue an emergency order prohibiting the super PAC and nonprofit from spending money to support Brown.[46]\n\n\nIn May 2023, two canvassers working for the group One PA, who were canvassing for Gym and a candidate for City Council, got into an altercation, which resulted in a fatal shooting.[47]\n\n\n\n### Debates[edit]\n\n\n\n\n2023 Philadelphia mayoral election Democratic primary debates\n| No. | Date\n | Host\n | Moderator\n | Link\n | Participants\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Key:\u00a0P\u00a0 Participant\u00a0 \u00a0A\u00a0 Absent\u00a0 \u00a0N\u00a0 Non-invitee\u00a0 \u00a0I\u00a0 Invitee \u00a0W\u00a0 Withdrawn |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Warren Bloom\n | Amen Brown | Jeff Brown\n | Allan Domb | James DeLeon\n | Derek S.
