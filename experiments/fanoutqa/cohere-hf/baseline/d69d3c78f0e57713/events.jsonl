From 2015 to 2019, the state proportion of total UK students admitted each year was: 55.6%, 58.0%, 58.2%, 60.5% and 62.3%.[138] Oxford University spends over £6 million per year on outreach programs to encourage applicants from underrepresented demographics.[134]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n104. **^** \"Oxford's Said Business School\". *The Guardian*. 10 December 2001.

Archibald Campbell Tait, former headmaster of Rugby School, was a key member of the Oxford Commission; he wanted Oxford to follow the German and Scottish model in which the professorship was paramount. The commission's report envisioned a centralised university run predominantly by professors and faculties, with a much stronger emphasis on research. The professional staff should be strengthened and better paid. For students, restrictions on entry should be dropped, and more opportunities given to poorer families. It called for an enlargement of the curriculum, with honours to be awarded in many new fields. Undergraduate scholarships should be open to all Britons. Graduate fellowships should be opened up to all members of the university. It recommended that fellows be released from an obligation for ordination. Students were to be allowed to save money by boarding in the city, instead of in a college.[48][49]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n139. **^** \"Oxford failing on diversity says Lammy\". *BBC News*. 23 May 2018.

Thereafter, an increasing number of students lived in colleges rather than in halls and religious houses.[25]\n\n\nIn 1333–1334, an attempt by some dissatisfied Oxford scholars to found a new university at Stamford, Lincolnshire, was blocked by the universities of Oxford and Cambridge petitioning King Edward III.[29] Thereafter, until the 1820s, no new universities were allowed to be founded in England, even in London; thus, Oxford and Cambridge had a duopoly, which was unusual in large western European countries.[30][31]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n72. **^** Jenifer Hart (1989). \"Women at Oxford since the Advent of Mixed Colleges\". *Oxford Review of Education*. **15** (3): 217–219. doi:10.1080/0305498890150302.

From 2015 to 2019, the state proportion of total UK students admitted each year was: 55.6%, 58.0%, 58.2%, 60.5% and 62.3%.[138] Oxford University spends over £6 million per year on outreach programs to encourage applicants from underrepresented demographics.[134]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n104. **^** \"Oxford's Said Business School\". *The Guardian*. 10 December 2001.

Archibald Campbell Tait, former headmaster of Rugby School, was a key member of the Oxford Commission; he wanted Oxford to follow the German and Scottish model in which the professorship was paramount. The commission's report envisioned a centralised university run predominantly by professors and faculties, with a much stronger emphasis on research. The professional staff should be strengthened and better paid. For students, restrictions on entry should be dropped, and more opportunities given to poorer families. It called for an enlargement of the curriculum, with honours to be awarded in many new fields. Undergraduate scholarships should be open to all Britons. Graduate fellowships should be opened up to all members of the university. It recommended that fellows be released from an obligation for ordination. Students were to be allowed to save money by boarding in the city, instead of in a college.[48][49]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n139. **^** \"Oxford failing on diversity says Lammy\". *BBC News*. 23 May 2018.

Thereafter, an increasing number of students lived in colleges rather than in halls and religious houses.[25]\n\n\nIn 1333–1334, an attempt by some dissatisfied Oxford scholars to found a new university at Stamford, Lincolnshire, was blocked by the universities of Oxford and Cambridge petitioning King Edward III.[29] Thereafter, until the 1820s, no new universities were allowed to be founded in England, even in London; thus, Oxford and Cambridge had a duopoly, which was unusual in large western European countries.[30][31]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n72. **^** Jenifer Hart (1989). \"Women at Oxford since the Advent of Mixed Colleges\". *Oxford Review of Education*. **15** (3): 217–219. doi:10.1080/0305498890150302.

Due to a high proportion of applicants receiving the highest school grades, an interview process was introduced as a component of consideration for admission. Interviews are performed by College Fellows, who evaluate candidates on unexamined factors including potential for original thinking and creativity.[114] For exceptional candidates, a matriculation offer is sometimes offered, requiring only two A-levels at grade E or above.

UAE also was behind the leak of over 50,000 phone numbers, including hundreds belonging to British citizens. Stephen Toope, the university's outgoing Vice-Chancellor, said the decision to suspend its collaboration with UAE also was a result of additional revelations about UAE's Pegasus software hacking.[94]\n\n\n\n#### Bonds[edit]\n\n\nThe University of Cambridge borrowed £350 million in October 2012 by issuing 40-year security bonds,[95] whose interest rate is approximately 0.6 percent higher than the British government's 40-year bond.[96]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAs a result of St Hilda's College, Oxford ending its ban on male students in 2008, Cambridge is now the only remaining university in the United Kingdom with female-only colleges; the two female-only colleges at the university are Newnham and Murray Edwards.[38][39] As of the 2019–2020 academic year, the university's male to female enrollment, including post-graduates, was nearly balanced with its total student population being 53% male and 47% female.[40]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2006, a Thomson Scientific study reported that the University of Cambridge had the highest research paper output of any British university and ranked first in research production as assessed by total paper citation count in ten of 21 major British research fields.[170] An evidence-based study published the same year showed that the University of Cambridge won a larger proportion (6.6%) of total British research grants and contracts than any other university, ranking first in three out of four major measured discipline fields.[171]\n\n\n\n## Student life[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Academic dress of the University of Cambridge, List of organisations and institutions associated with the University of Cambridge, and List of social activities at the University of Cambridge\n\n### Formal halls and May balls[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n83. **^** Grace 2 5 December 2007\n84. **^** \"How the University works: The Senate\".

But since women were not yet admitted to the Bachelor of Arts degree program, they were excluded from the university's governance structure. Since University of Cambridge students must belong to a college, and since established colleges remained closed to women, women found admissions restricted to few university colleges that had been established only for them. Darwin College, the first graduate college of the university, matriculated both male and female students from its inception in 1964 and elected a mixed fellowship. Undergraduate colleges, starting with Churchill, Clare, and King's Colleges, began admitting women between 1972 and 1988. Among women's colleges at the university, Girton began admitting male students in 1979, and Lucy Cavendish began admitting men in 2021. But the other female-only colleges have remained female-only colleges as of 2023. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn January 2021, Cambridge created foundation courses for disadvantaged students.[139] While the usual entry requirements are A\\*AA in A-Levels, the one-year foundation course has 50 places for students who achieve BBB.[140] If successful on the course, students receive a recognised CertHE qualification and can progress to degrees in the arts, humanities, and social sciences at the university.[139] Candidates include those who have been in care, who are estranged from their families, who have missed significant periods of learning because of health issues, those from low-income backgrounds, and those from schools with few students attending universities.[139]\n\n\n\n### Teaching[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Cambridge School (intellectual history) and List of professorships at the University of Cambridge\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Percent of state school students at Cambridge and Oxford[125][126]\nPublic debate in the United Kingdom exists over whether admissions processes used at the University of Oxford and Cambridge are entirely merit-based and fair, whether enough students from state schools are encouraged to apply, and whether these students are offered sufficient admission. In 2020–21, 71% of all successful applicants were from state schools[127] compared to approximately 93% of all students in the UK who attended state schools and 82% of post-16 students[128]). \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nUniversity of Cambridge| ![](image)Coat of arms\n |\n| Latin: *Universitas Cantabrigiensis* |\n| Other name\n | The Chancellor, Masters and Scholars of the University of Cambridge |\n| Motto | Latin: *Hinc lucem et pocula sacra* |\n| Motto in English\n | Literal: From here, light and sacred draughts.\nNon literal: From this place, we gain enlightenment and precious knowledge. |\n| Type | Public research university |\n| Established | c. 1209; 815 years ago (1209) |\n| Academic affiliations\n | * Russell Group\n* EUA\n* LERU\n* IARU\n* Universities UK\n |\n| Endowment | £9.326 billion (including colleges)[3] |\n| Budget | £2.308 billion (excluding colleges)[4] |\n| Chancellor | The Lord Sainsbury of Turville |\n| Vice-Chancellor | Deborah Prentice |\n| Academic staff\n | 6,170 (2020)[5] |\n| Administrative staff\n | 3,615 (excluding colleges)[5] |\n| Students | 24,450 (2020)[6] |\n| Undergraduates | 12,850 (2020) |\n| Postgraduates | 11,600 (2020) |\n| Location | Cambridge\n, England\n |\n| Campus | * University town\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n14. **^** \"Nobel prize winners\".

Founded in 1209, the University of Cambridge is the world's third-oldest university in continuous operation. The university's founding followed the arrival of scholars who left the University of Oxford for Cambridge after a dispute with local townspeople.[10][11] The two ancient English universities, although sometimes described as rivals, share many common features and are often jointly referred to as *Oxbridge*. In 1231, 22 years after its founding, the university was recognised with a royal charter granted by King Henry III.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2021, Cambridge Students' Union launched a petition opposing the financial collaboration between the university and the government of United Arab Emirates that was worth £400m. The Union cited a \"values gap\" and threat to \"academic freedom and institutional autonomy\" following the release of internal UAE documents. Citing UAE's history of violating international human rights laws, it warned that university staff were vulnerable under the partnership to repression by gender, sexuality, or freedom of expression.[182]\n\n\nIn 2023, 72% of the Students' Union voted in favour of hosting talks regarding the removal of all animal products from cafes and canteens operated by the university's catering services. The students backed vegan food in response to threats to the climate and biodiversity. The vote is non-binding since the university controls the catering service.[183] After the vote, Darwin College decided to serve only vegan food at its May Ball in 2023.[184]\n\n\n\n## Notable alumni and academics[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nUniversity of Cambridge\n |\n| --- |\n| People | * Chancellor\n\t+ The Lord Sainsbury of Turville\n* Vice-Chancellor\n\t+ Deborah Prentice\n* List of University of Cambridge people\n | ![](image)\n |\n| Colleges | * Christ's\n* Churchill\n* Clare\n* Clare Hall\n* Corpus Christi\n* Darwin\n* Downing\n* Emmanuel\n* Fitzwilliam\n* Girton\n* Gonville and Caius\n* Homerton\n* Hughes Hall\n* Jesus\n* King’s\n* Lucy Cavendish\n* Magdalene\n* Murray Edwards\n* Newnham\n* Pembroke\n* Peterhouse\n* Queens’\n* Robinson\n* St Catharine’s\n* St Edmund’s\n* St John’s\n* Selwyn\n* Sidney Sussex\n* Trinity\n* Trinity Hall\n* Wolfson\n |\n| Faculties anddepartments, by school | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![Peterhouse Old Court](image)Peterhouse Old Court\n![](image)Great Court of Trinity College, dating back to the 16th Century\nAdmission to the University of Cambridge is competitive. In 2018–2019, for instance, 18.8% of applicants were admitted.[108][109] In 2021, Cambridge introduced an over-subscription clause to its offers of admission, which also permits the university to withdraw acceptances if too many students meet its selective entrance criteria. The clause can be invoked in the event of circumstances outside the reasonable control of the university. The clause was introduced following a record number of A-level pupils obtained the highest grades from teacher assessment, which was introduced due to the cancellation of A-level examinations during the COVID-19 pandemic.[110][111]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| University  of London | * Birkbeck\n* City\n* Courtauld\n* Goldsmiths\n* Institute of Cancer Research\n* King's\n* London Business School\n* LSE\n* LSHTM\n* Queen Mary\n* Royal Academy of Music\n* Royal Central School of Speech and Drama\n* Royal Holloway\n* Royal Veterinary College\n* School of Advanced Study\n* St George's\n* SOAS\n* UCL\n |\n| Other | * Brunel\n* East London\n* Greenwich\n* Imperial\n* Kingston\n* London Met\n* London South Bank\n* Middlesex\n* Northeastern University – London\n* Ravensbourne\n* Regent's\n* Richmond, The American International University in London\n* Royal College of Art\n* Royal College of Music\n* Roehampton\n* St Mary's\n* University of the Arts London\n* Westminster\n* West London\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Grove at Fitzwilliam College\n* ![Gatehouse at Girton College](image)\n\nGatehouse at Girton College\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)United Kingdom portal\n\n\n* Armorial of British universities\n* Cambridge University Constabulary\n* Cambridge University primates\n* Coat of arms of the University of Cambridge\n* List of medieval universities\n* List of Nobel laureates affiliated with the University of Cambridge\n* List of organisations and institutions associated with the University of Cambridge\n* List of organisations with a British royal charter\n* List of professorships at the University of Cambridge\n* List of universities in the United Kingdom\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThere were, as of the 2020–21 admissions cycle, only two grounds for compulsory pooling. For post-qualified applicants, their achieved grades at A level or equivalent and, for applicants with overseas interviews, an interview score of at least eight is achieved in all interviews. The second criterion does not apply to medicine applicants.[123] Previously, AS-Level UMS have been used as pooling criteria, but after A-levels became linear this was discontinued.[123]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nEnough scholars ultimately took residence in Cambridge to form, along with the many scholars already there, the nucleus for the new university's formation.[16][17][18]\n\n\nBy 1225, a chancellor of the university was appointed, and writs issued by King Henry III in 1231 established that rents in Cambridge were to be set *secundum consuetudinem universitatis*, according to the custom of the university, and established a panel of two masters and two townsmen to determine these. A letter from Pope Gregory IX two years later to the chancellor and the guild of scholars granted the new university *ius non trahi extra*, or the right not to be drawn out, for three years, meaning its members could not be summoned to a court outside of the diocese of Ely.[19]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe University of Cambridge's first college, Peterhouse, was founded in 1284 by Hugh de Balsham, the Bishop of Ely. Multiple additional colleges were founded during the 14th and 15th centuries, and colleges continued being established through modern times, though there was a 204-year gap between the founding of Sidney Sussex in 1596 and that of Downing in 1800. The most recent college to be established is Robinson, which was built in the late 1970s. Most recently, in March 2010, Homerton College achieved full university college status, making it technically the university's newest full college.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n37. **^** \"Trinity Hall's Steamboat Ladies\".

Due to a high proportion of applicants receiving the highest school grades, an interview process was introduced as a component of consideration for admission. Interviews are performed by College Fellows, who evaluate candidates on unexamined factors including potential for original thinking and creativity.[114] For exceptional candidates, a matriculation offer is sometimes offered, requiring only two A-levels at grade E or above. Sutton Trust maintains that the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge recruit disproportionately from eight schools, which account for 1,310 Oxbridge places over three years contrasted with 1,220 from 2,900 other schools.[115]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nCritics have argued that the relative lower percent of state school applicants with the required grades for admission to Cambridge and Oxford has had a negative impact on Oxford and Cambridge's collective reputation, though both universities have encouraged pupils from state schools to apply to help redress the perceived imbalance.[129] Others counter that government pressure to increase state school admissions constitutes inappropriate social engineering.[130][131] The proportion of undergraduates drawn from independent schools has dropped over the years, constituting, as of 2020, 26% of total admissions among the university's 3,436 applicants from independent schools compared to 23% of the 9,237 applications from state schools.[132] Cambridge, together with Oxford and Durham, was among those universities that adopted formulae in 2009 to rate the GCSE performance of schools, using data from the Department for Children, Schools and Families, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2000, Bill Gates of Microsoft donated US$210 million through the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to endow Gates Scholarships for students from outside the United Kingdom pursuing post-graduate study at Cambridge.[93]\n\n\nIn October 2021, the university suspended its £400m collaboration with the United Arab Emirates, citing allegations that UAE was involved in illegal hacking of the university's computer and storage systems using NSO Group's Pegasus software. UAE also was behind the leak of over 50,000 phone numbers, including hundreds belonging to British citizens. Stephen Toope, the university's outgoing Vice-Chancellor, said the decision to suspend its collaboration with UAE also was a result of additional revelations about UAE's Pegasus software hacking.[94]\n\n\n\n#### Bonds[edit]\n\n\nThe University of Cambridge borrowed £350 million in October 2012 by issuing 40-year security bonds,[95] whose interest rate is approximately 0.6 percent higher than the British government's 40-year bond.[96]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAs a result of St Hilda's College, Oxford ending its ban on male students in 2008, Cambridge is now the only remaining university in the United Kingdom with female-only colleges; the two female-only colleges at the university are Newnham and Murray Edwards.[38][39] As of the 2019–2020 academic year, the university's male to female enrollment, including post-graduates, was nearly balanced with its total student population being 53% male and 47% female.[40]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2006, a Thomson Scientific study reported that the University of Cambridge had the highest research paper output of any British university and ranked first in research production as assessed by total paper citation count in ten of 21 major British research fields.[170] An evidence-based study published the same year showed that the University of Cambridge won a larger proportion (6.6%) of total British research grants and contracts than any other university, ranking first in three out of four major measured discipline fields.[171]\n\n\n\n## Student life[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Academic dress of the University of Cambridge, List of organisations and institutions associated with the University of Cambridge, and List of social activities at the University of Cambridge\n\n### Formal halls and May balls[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n83. **^** Grace 2 5 December 2007\n84. **^** \"How the University works: The Senate\".

But since women were not yet admitted to the Bachelor of Arts degree program, they were excluded from the university's governance structure. Since University of Cambridge students must belong to a college, and since established colleges remained closed to women, women found admissions restricted to few university colleges that had been established only for them. Darwin College, the first graduate college of the university, matriculated both male and female students from its inception in 1964 and elected a mixed fellowship. Undergraduate colleges, starting with Churchill, Clare, and King's Colleges, began admitting women between 1972 and 1988. Among women's colleges at the university, Girton began admitting male students in 1979, and Lucy Cavendish began admitting men in 2021. But the other female-only colleges have remained female-only colleges as of 2023. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn January 2021, Cambridge created foundation courses for disadvantaged students.[139] While the usual entry requirements are A\\*AA in A-Levels, the one-year foundation course has 50 places for students who achieve BBB.[140] If successful on the course, students receive a recognised CertHE qualification and can progress to degrees in the arts, humanities, and social sciences at the university.[139] Candidates include those who have been in care, who are estranged from their families, who have missed significant periods of learning because of health issues, those from low-income backgrounds, and those from schools with few students attending universities.[139]\n\n\n\n### Teaching[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Cambridge School (intellectual history) and List of professorships at the University of Cambridge\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Percent of state school students at Cambridge and Oxford[125][126]\nPublic debate in the United Kingdom exists over whether admissions processes used at the University of Oxford and Cambridge are entirely merit-based and fair, whether enough students from state schools are encouraged to apply, and whether these students are offered sufficient admission.

Founded in 1209, the University of Cambridge is the world's third-oldest university in continuous operation. The university's founding followed the arrival of scholars who left the University of Oxford for Cambridge after a dispute with local townspeople.[10][11] The two ancient English universities, although sometimes described as rivals, share many common features and are often jointly referred to as *Oxbridge*. In 1231, 22 years after its founding, the university was recognised with a royal charter granted by King Henry III.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2021, Cambridge Students' Union launched a petition opposing the financial collaboration between the university and the government of United Arab Emirates that was worth £400m. The Union cited a \"values gap\" and threat to \"academic freedom and institutional autonomy\" following the release of internal UAE documents. Citing UAE's history of violating international human rights laws, it warned that university staff were vulnerable under the partnership to repression by gender, sexuality, or freedom of expression.[182]\n\n\nIn 2023, 72% of the Students' Union voted in favour of hosting talks regarding the removal of all animal products from cafes and canteens operated by the university's catering services. The students backed vegan food in response to threats to the climate and biodiversity. The vote is non-binding since the university controls the catering service.[183] After the vote, Darwin College decided to serve only vegan food at its May Ball in 2023.[184]\n\n\n\n## Notable alumni and academics[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nUniversity of Cambridge\n |\n| --- |\n| People | * Chancellor\n\t+ The Lord Sainsbury of Turville\n* Vice-Chancellor\n\t+ Deborah Prentice\n* List of University of Cambridge people\n | ![](image)\n |\n| Colleges | * Christ's\n* Churchill\n* Clare\n* Clare Hall\n* Corpus Christi\n* Darwin\n* Downing\n* Emmanuel\n* Fitzwilliam\n* Girton\n* Gonville and Caius\n* Homerton\n* Hughes Hall\n* Jesus\n* King’s\n* Lucy Cavendish\n* Magdalene\n* Murray Edwards\n* Newnham\n* Pembroke\n* Peterhouse\n* Queens’\n* Robinson\n* St Catharine’s\n* St Edmund’s\n* St John’s\n* Selwyn\n* Sidney Sussex\n* Trinity\n* Trinity Hall\n* Wolfson\n |\n| Faculties anddepartments, by school | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![Peterhouse Old Court](image)Peterhouse Old Court\n![](image)Great Court of Trinity College, dating back to the 16th Century\nAdmission to the University of Cambridge is competitive. In 2018–2019, for instance, 18.8% of applicants were admitted.[108][109] In 2021, Cambridge introduced an over-subscription clause to its offers of admission, which also permits the university to withdraw acceptances if too many students meet its selective entrance criteria. The clause can be invoked in the event of circumstances outside the reasonable control of the university. The clause was introduced following a record number of A-level pupils obtained the highest grades from teacher assessment, which was introduced due to the cancellation of A-level examinations during the COVID-19 pandemic.[110][111]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| University  of London | * Birkbeck\n* City\n* Courtauld\n* Goldsmiths\n* Institute of Cancer Research\n* King's\n* London Business School\n* LSE\n* LSHTM\n* Queen Mary\n* Royal Academy of Music\n* Royal Central School of Speech and Drama\n* Royal Holloway\n* Royal Veterinary College\n* School of Advanced Study\n* St George's\n* SOAS\n* UCL\n |\n| Other | * Brunel\n* East London\n* Greenwich\n* Imperial\n* Kingston\n* London Met\n* London South Bank\n* Middlesex\n* Northeastern University – London\n* Ravensbourne\n* Regent's\n* Richmond, The American International University in London\n* Royal College of Art\n* Royal College of Music\n* Roehampton\n* St Mary's\n* University of the Arts London\n* Westminster\n* West London\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Grove at Fitzwilliam College\n* ![Gatehouse at Girton College](image)\n\nGatehouse at Girton College\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)United Kingdom portal\n\n\n* Armorial of British universities\n* Cambridge University Constabulary\n* Cambridge University primates\n* Coat of arms of the University of Cambridge\n* List of medieval universities\n* List of Nobel laureates affiliated with the University of Cambridge\n* List of organisations and institutions associated with the University of Cambridge\n* List of organisations with a British royal charter\n* List of professorships at the University of Cambridge\n* List of universities in the United Kingdom\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThere were, as of the 2020–21 admissions cycle, only two grounds for compulsory pooling. For post-qualified applicants, their achieved grades at A level or equivalent and, for applicants with overseas interviews, an interview score of at least eight is achieved in all interviews. The second criterion does not apply to medicine applicants.[123] Previously, AS-Level UMS have been used as pooling criteria, but after A-levels became linear this was discontinued.[123]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nEnough scholars ultimately took residence in Cambridge to form, along with the many scholars already there, the nucleus for the new university's formation.[16][17][18]\n\n\nBy 1225, a chancellor of the university was appointed, and writs issued by King Henry III in 1231 established that rents in Cambridge were to be set *secundum consuetudinem universitatis*, according to the custom of the university, and established a panel of two masters and two townsmen to determine these. A letter from Pope Gregory IX two years later to the chancellor and the guild of scholars granted the new university *ius non trahi extra*, or the right not to be drawn out, for three years, meaning its members could not be summoned to a court outside of the diocese of Ely.[19]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe University of Cambridge's first college, Peterhouse, was founded in 1284 by Hugh de Balsham, the Bishop of Ely. Multiple additional colleges were founded during the 14th and 15th centuries, and colleges continued being established through modern times, though there was a 204-year gap between the founding of Sidney Sussex in 1596 and that of Downing in 1800. The most recent college to be established is Robinson, which was built in the late 1970s. Most recently, in March 2010, Homerton College achieved full university college status, making it technically the university's newest full college.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n37. **^** \"Trinity Hall's Steamboat Ladies\".

In 2004, Queen Elizabeth II opened the Imperial College Business School.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n\n |\n| Colours |   Imperial blue[5] |\n| Affiliations | * ACU\n* EUA\n* Global Alliance of Technological Universities\n* LERU\n* Russell Group\n* SES\n |\n| Mascot | Lion |\n| Website | www.imperial.ac.uk ![Edit this at Wikidata](image) |\n| ![](image) |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAt the start of the 20th century, there was a concern that Great Britain was falling behind Germany in scientific and technical education. A departmental committee was set up at the Board of Education in 1904, to look into the future of the Royal College of Science. A report released in 1906 called for the establishment of an institution unifying the Royal College of Science and the Royal School of Mines, as well as – if an agreement could be reached with the City and Guilds of London Institute – its Central Technical College.[20][21]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nLeague of European Research Universities (LERU)\n |\n| --- |\n| * Amsterdam\n* Barcelona\n* Cambridge\n* Copenhagen\n* Dublin (TCD)\n* Edinburgh\n* Freiburg\n* Geneva\n* Heidelberg\n* Helsinki\n* Imperial\n* Leiden\n* Leuven\n* Lund\n* Milan\n* LMU Munich\n* Oxford\n* Paris-Saclay\n* Sorbonne\n* Strasbourg\n* UCL\n* Utrecht\n* Zurich\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nGlobal Alliance of Technological Universities\n |\n| --- |\n| * California Institute of Technology\n* Carnegie Mellon University\n* ETH Zurich\n* Georgia Tech\n* Imperial College London\n* Indian Institute of Technology Bombay\n* Nanyang Technological University\n* Shanghai Jiao Tong University\n* Technical University of Munich\n* University of New South Wales\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n108. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Where do HE students study?\". *hesa.ac.uk*.

In 2004, Queen Elizabeth II opened the Imperial College Business School.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n\n |\n| Colours |   Imperial blue[5] |\n| Affiliations | * ACU\n* EUA\n* Global Alliance of Technological Universities\n* LERU\n* Russell Group\n* SES\n |\n| Mascot | Lion |\n| Website | www.imperial.ac.uk ![Edit this at Wikidata](image) |\n| ![](image) |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAt the start of the 20th century, there was a concern that Great Britain was falling behind Germany in scientific and technical education.

The portico and dome were completed in 1829, but lack of funds meant it would be many years before reality matched the picture.\nUCL was founded on 11 February 1826 as an alternative to the Anglican universities of Oxford and Cambridge. It took the form of a joint stock company, with shares sold for £100 (equivalent to £10,600 in 2023) to proprietors, under the name of *London University*, although without legal recognition as a university or the associated right to award degrees.[20][21][22] London University's first warden was Leonard Horner, who was the first scientist to head a British university.[23]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe late 2010s saw student campaigns around the cost of university-run accommodation. In 2016, over 1000 students took part in a rent strike in protest against high rents and poor conditions. Organisers said they had won over £1 million in rent cuts, freezes and grants from UCL in the settlement that ended the strike.[294] Another rent strike in 2017 lead to UCL pledging around £1.4 million in bursaries and rent freezes, mostly in the form of accommodation bursaries for less well-off students totalling £600,000 per year for the 2017/18 and 2018/19 academic years.[295] Another rent strike was held at two halls of residence in the third term of the 2017/18 academic year due to complaints over conditions at those halls.[296]\n\n\n\n## Student body[edit]\n\n\nUCL student body 2021/22\n\n\n\nUK undergrad (23.5%)\nInt undergrad (27.3%)\nUK taught postgrad (17.4%)\nInt taught postgrad (18.7%)\nUK research postgrad (7.5%)\nInt research postgrad (5.6%)\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Undergraduates | 23,800 (2021/22)[6] |\n| Postgraduates | 23,030 (2021/22)[6] |\n| Other students\n | 895 (studying wholly overseas; 2021/22) |\n| Location | London, England\n51°31′29″N 00°08′01″W﻿ / ﻿51.52472°N 0.13361°W﻿ / 51.52472; -0.13361 |\n| Campus | Urban |\n| Colours | Purple and blue celeste[7]\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n\n |\n| Affiliations | * ACU\n* EUA\n* LERU\n* Russell Group\n* SES\n* University of London\n* Universities UK\n |\n| Website | ucl.ac.uk |\n\n\n**University College London**, which operates as **UCL**,[8][9][10] is a public research university in London, England.

On the same day, the University of London was created by royal charter as a degree-awarding examining board for students from affiliated schools and colleges, with University College and King's College, London being named in the charter as the first two affiliates.[32][33] The first students from UCL and King's matriculated as undergraduates in 1838 and the first degrees were awarded to students of the two colleges in 1839.[34]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPublic research university in London, England\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFor UK domiciled young full-time undergraduate entrants in 2020/21, 67.6% came from state schools, significantly below the location-adjusted benchmark of 74.5%, and 4.3% came from low participation neighbourhoods, not significantly different from the location-adjusted benchmark of 4.0%.[252] For UK-domiciled undergraduate entrants in 2022/23, UCAS data shows no significant difference in offer rate with ethnicity or gender.[246] Applicants from the 20% of neighbourhoods with the lowest rates of participation in higher education receive offers at a rate 4.9% higher than would be expected based on their subject choice and predicted grades alone, a statistically significant difference, accounting for 6.3% of all offers.

The portico and dome were completed in 1829, but lack of funds meant it would be many years before reality matched the picture.\nUCL was founded on 11 February 1826 as an alternative to the Anglican universities of Oxford and Cambridge. It took the form of a joint stock company, with shares sold for £100 (equivalent to £10,600 in 2023) to proprietors, under the name of *London University*, although without legal recognition as a university or the associated right to award degrees.[20][21][22] London University's first warden was Leonard Horner, who was the first scientist to head a British university.[23]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe late 2010s saw student campaigns around the cost of university-run accommodation. In 2016, over 1000 students took part in a rent strike in protest against high rents and poor conditions. Organisers said they had won over £1 million in rent cuts, freezes and grants from UCL in the settlement that ended the strike.[294] Another rent strike in 2017 lead to UCL pledging around £1.4 million in bursaries and rent freezes, mostly in the form of accommodation bursaries for less well-off students totalling £600,000 per year for the 2017/18 and 2018/19 academic years.[295] Another rent strike was held at two halls of residence in the third term of the 2017/18 academic year due to complaints over conditions at those halls.[296]\n\n\n\n## Student body[edit]\n\n\nUCL student body 2021/22\n\n\n\nUK undergrad (23.5%)\nInt undergrad (27.3%)\nUK taught postgrad (17.4%)\nInt taught postgrad (18.7%)\nUK research postgrad (7.5%)\nInt research postgrad (5.6%)\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Undergraduates | 23,800 (2021/22)[6] |\n| Postgraduates | 23,030 (2021/22)[6] |\n| Other students\n | 895 (studying wholly overseas; 2021/22) |\n| Location | London, England\n51°31′29″N 00°08′01″W﻿ / ﻿51.52472°N 0.13361°W﻿ / 51.52472; -0.13361 |\n| Campus | Urban |\n| Colours | Purple and blue celeste[7]\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n\n |\n| Affiliations | * ACU\n* EUA\n* LERU\n* Russell Group\n* SES\n* University of London\n* Universities UK\n |\n| Website | ucl.ac.uk |\n\n\n**University College London**, which operates as **UCL**,[8][9][10] is a public research university in London, England.

The scheme came to be known as the 'LLA examination' (Lady Literate in Arts). It required women to pass five subjects at an ordinary level and one at honours level and entitled them to hold a diploma from the university. Not being required to attend the university in person, the women were learning by correspondence, taking as many years as needed to complete the course. They were both examined and assisted in their studies by educationalists in the town or city in which they lived in the UK or abroad.[26]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nUniversity of St Andrews| ![Crest of the University of St Andrews](image)Shield of the University of St Andrews\n |\n| Latin: *Universitas Sancti Andreae apud Scotos* |\n| Motto | Ancient Greek: Αἰὲν ἀριστεύειν(Aien aristeuein)[1]\n |\n| Motto in English\n | Ever to ExcelorEver to be the Best |\n| Type | Public research university\nAncient university |\n| Established | 1413; 611 years ago (1413)[2] |\n| Academic affiliations\n | EUAEuropaeumUniversities ScotlandUniversities UKWallace Group  Sutton 13  |\n| Endowment | £113.1 million (2022)[3] |\n| Budget | £305.7 million (2021–22)[3] |\n| Chancellor | The Lord Campbell of Pittenweem |\n| Rector | Stella Maris |\n| Principal | Dame Sally Mapstone |\n| Academic staff\n | 1,355 (2021/22)[4] |\n| Administrative staff\n | 1,700 (2021/22)[4] |\n| Students | 11,820 (2021/22)[5] |\n| Undergraduates | 9,345 (2021/22)[5] |\n| Postgraduates | 2,475 (2021/22)[5] |\n| Location | St Andrews\n, Scotland\n |\n| Campus | College town |\n| Colours | United College, St Andrews\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nthe acceptance rate was 8.35% and the offer rate was 22.5% for Scottish/EU applicants where places are capped by the Scottish Government.[110][111] In 2017, the most competitive courses for Scottish/EU applicants were those within the Schools of International Relations, Management, and Economics and Finance with offer rates of 8.0%, 10.9% and 11.5% respectively.[110][112] The university has a higher proportion of female than male students with a female ratio of 59.7% in the undergraduate population.[113]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n33. **^** \"Literate Ladies – A fifty year experiment\" (PDF).

The residence was named University Hall.[33][34]\n\n\n\n#### Dundee[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n37. **^** *Records of University College, Dundee, being the University of St Andrews in Dundee*.

The Commission of 1878 recommended a college be established in Dundee to teach mathematical and physical and natural sciences and medicine, **leaving the literary part of the Arts faculty to St Andrews**. The deed of endowment provided for the erection of a comprehensive 'University College', providing courses for both sexes in a wide variety of subjects except divinity (forbidden by the non-conformist founder) and medicine (which would follow). After 1 October 1897 the college became subject to the academic control of the senate and its teaching staff was appointed by the St Andrews University Court. In an effort to avoid duplication the two Arts chairs (Classics and English) in University College lapsed into lectureships after the professors left in 1895 and 1901 respectively. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Castle House, School of English\n### Faculties and schools[edit]\n\n\nThe four academic faculties collectively encompass 18 schools.

Students apply to become members of a particular faculty, as opposed to the school within which teaching is based. The faculties and their affiliated schools are:\n\n\n\n* Faculty of Arts: art history, classics, economics, English, film studies, history, international relations, management, modern languages, philosophy, social anthropology.[67]\n* Faculty of Divinity: divinity.[68]\n* Faculty of Medicine: medicine.[69]\n* Faculty of Science: biology, chemistry, computer science, geography and geosciences, mathematics, physics and astronomy, psychology and neuroscience.[70]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nActive recruitment of students from North America first began in 1984, with Americans now making up around 1 in 6 of the student population in 2017.[42] Students from almost every state in the United States and province in Canada are represented.[43][44] This is the highest proportion and absolute number of American students amongst all British universities.[45][46] Media reports indicate growing numbers of American students are attracted to the university's academics, traditions, prestige, internationalism, and comparatively low tuition fees.[47][48][49][50] The university also regularly features as one of the few non-North American universities in the Fiske Guide to Colleges, an American college guide, as a 'Best Buy'.[51][52] St Andrews has developed a sizable alumni presence in the United States, with over 8000 alumni spread across all 50 states.[53] Most major cities host alumni clubs, the largest of which is in New York.[54] Both London and New York also host the St Andrews Angels, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)College Hall, within the 16th-century St Mary's College building\nThe university was founded in 1410 when a group of Augustinian clergy, driven from the University of Paris by the Avignon schism and from the universities of Oxford and Cambridge by the Anglo-Scottish Wars, formed a society of higher learning in St Andrews, which offered courses of lectures in divinity, logic, philosophy, and law. A charter of privilege was bestowed upon the society of masters and scholars by the Bishop of St Andrews, Henry Wardlaw,[14] on 28 February 1411–12.[15] Wardlaw then successfully petitioned the Avignon Pope Benedict XIII to grant the school university status by issuing a series of papal bulls, which followed on 28 August 1413.[16] King James I of Scotland confirmed the charter of the university in 1432. Subsequent kings supported the university, with King James V of Scotland \"confirming privileges of the university\" in 1532.[17][18]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1967, the union with Queen's College Dundee (formerly University College Dundee) ended, when it became an independent institution under the name of the University of Dundee. As a result of this, St Andrews lost its capacity to provide degrees in many areas such as Medicine, Dentistry, Law, Accountancy, and Engineering. As well as losing the right to confer the undergraduate medical degree MBChB, it was also deprived of the right to confer the postgraduate degree MD. St Andrews was eventually able to continue to offer the opportunity to study medicine through a new arrangement with the University of Manchester in England.\n\n\nIn 1972, the College of St Leonard was reconstituted as a postgraduate institute.[38]\n\n\n\n### Links with the United States[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This article's list of alumni **may not follow Wikipedia's verifiability policy**.

In a particularly acute depression in 1747, severe financial problems triggered the dissolution of St Leonard's College, whose properties and staff were merged into St Salvator's College to form the United College of St Salvator and St Leonard.[15] Throughout this period student numbers were very low; for instance, when Samuel Johnson visited the university in 1773, the university had fewer than 100 students, and was in his opinion in a steady decline. He described it as \"pining in decay and struggling for life\".[24] The poverty of Scotland during this period also damaged St Andrews, as few were able to patronise the university and its colleges, and with state support being improbable, the income they received was scarce.\n\n\n\n### Modern period[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Sporting affiliations\n | University of St Andrews Athletic Union |\n| Website | st-andrews.ac.uk ![Edit this at Wikidata](image) |\n\n\nThe **University of St Andrews** (Scots: *University o St Andras*, Scottish Gaelic: *Oilthigh Chill Rìmhinn*;[6] abbreviated as **St And**, from the Latin *Sancti Andreae*, in post-nominals) is a public university in St Andrews, Scotland. It is the oldest of the four ancient universities of Scotland and, following the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, the third-oldest university in the English-speaking world. St Andrews was founded in 1413 when the Avignon Antipope Benedict XIII issued a papal bull to a small founding group of Augustinian clergy. Along with the universities of Glasgow, Aberdeen, and Edinburgh, St Andrews was part of the Scottish Enlightenment during the 18th century.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Arts University Plymouth\n* Portsmouth\n* Reading\n* Royal Agricultural\n* Solent\n* Southampton\n* Surrey\n* Sussex\n* UWE Bristol\n* Winchester\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"73b48450-66d1-4336-a785-88d87ddb1dfd","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

placed seventh in the UK (1st in Scotland) for the employability of its graduates as chosen by recruiters from the UK's major companies.[91] In 2017, St Andrews was named as the university with the joint second highest graduate employment rate of any UK university (along with Warwick), with 97.7 per cent of its graduates in work or further study three and a half years after graduation.[92] An

The scheme came to be known as the 'LLA examination' (Lady Literate in Arts). It required women to pass five subjects at an ordinary level and one at honours level and entitled them to hold a diploma from the university. Not being required to attend the university in person, the women were learning by correspondence, taking as many years as needed to complete the course. They were both examined and assisted in their studies by educationalists in the town or city in which they lived in the UK or abroad.[26]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nUniversity of St Andrews| ![Crest of the University of St Andrews](image)Shield of the University of St Andrews\n |\n| Latin: *Universitas Sancti Andreae apud Scotos* |\n| Motto | Ancient Greek: Αἰὲν ἀριστεύειν(Aien aristeuein)[1]\n |\n| Motto in English\n | Ever to ExcelorEver to be the Best |\n| Type | Public research university\nAncient university |\n| Established | 1413; 611 years ago (1413)[2] |\n| Academic affiliations\n | EUAEuropaeumUniversities ScotlandUniversities UKWallace Group  Sutton 13  |\n| Endowment | £113.1 million (2022)[3] |\n| Budget | £305.7 million (2021–22)[3] |\n| Chancellor | The Lord Campbell of Pittenweem |\n| Rector | Stella Maris |\n| Principal | Dame Sally Mapstone |\n| Academic staff\n | 1,355 (2021/22)[4] |\n| Administrative staff\n | 1,700 (2021/22)[4] |\n| Students | 11,820 (2021/22)[5] |\n| Undergraduates | 9,345 (2021/22)[5] |\n| Postgraduates | 2,475 (2021/22)[5] |\n| Location | St Andrews\n, Scotland\n |\n| Campus | College town |\n| Colours | United College, St Andrews\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nthe acceptance rate was 8.35% and the offer rate was 22.5% for Scottish/EU applicants where places are capped by the Scottish Government.[110][111] In 2017, the most competitive courses for Scottish/EU applicants were those within the Schools of International Relations, Management, and Economics and Finance with offer rates of 8.0%, 10.9% and 11.5% respectively.[110][112] The university has a higher proportion of female than male students with a female ratio of 59.7% in the undergraduate population.[113]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n33. **^** \"Literate Ladies – A fifty year experiment\" (PDF).

The faculties and their affiliated schools are:\n\n\n\n* Faculty of Arts: art history, classics, economics, English, film studies, history, international relations, management, modern languages, philosophy, social anthropology.[67]\n* Faculty of Divinity: divinity.[68]\n* Faculty of Medicine: medicine.[69]\n* Faculty of Science: biology, chemistry, computer science, geography and geosciences, mathematics, physics and astronomy, psychology and neuroscience.[70]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nActive recruitment of students from North America first began in 1984, with Americans now making up around 1 in 6 of the student population in 2017.[42] Students from almost every state in the United States and province in Canada are represented.[43][44] This is the highest proportion and absolute number of American students amongst all British universities.[45][46] Media reports indicate growing numbers of American students are attracted to the university's academics, traditions, prestige, internationalism, and comparatively low tuition fees.[47][48][49][50] The university also regularly features as one of the few non-North American universities in the Fiske Guide to Colleges, an American college guide, as a 'Best Buy'.[51][52] St Andrews has developed a sizable alumni presence in the United States, with over 8000 alumni spread across all 50 states.[53] Most major cities host alumni clubs, the largest of which is in New York.[54] Both London and New York also host the St Andrews Angels, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)College Hall, within the 16th-century St Mary's College building\nThe university was founded in 1410 when a group of Augustinian clergy, driven from the University of Paris by the Avignon schism and from the universities of Oxford and Cambridge by the Anglo-Scottish Wars, formed a society of higher learning in St Andrews, which offered courses of lectures in divinity, logic, philosophy, and law. A charter of privilege was bestowed upon the society of masters and scholars by the Bishop of St Andrews, Henry Wardlaw,[14] on 28 February 1411–12.[15] Wardlaw then successfully petitioned the Avignon Pope Benedict XIII to grant the school university status by issuing a series of papal bulls, which followed on 28 August 1413.[16] King James I of Scotland confirmed the charter of the university in 1432. Subsequent kings supported the university, with King James V of Scotland \"confirming privileges of the university\" in 1532.[17][18]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1967, the union with Queen's College Dundee (formerly University College Dundee) ended, when it became an independent institution under the name of the University of Dundee. As a result of this, St Andrews lost its capacity to provide degrees in many areas such as Medicine, Dentistry, Law, Accountancy, and Engineering. As well as losing the right to confer the undergraduate medical degree MBChB, it was also deprived of the right to confer the postgraduate degree MD. St Andrews was eventually able to continue to offer the opportunity to study medicine through a new arrangement with the University of Manchester in England.\n\n\nIn 1972, the College of St Leonard was reconstituted as a postgraduate institute.[38]\n\n\n\n### Links with the United States[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This article's list of alumni **may not follow Wikipedia's verifiability policy**.

In a particularly acute depression in 1747, severe financial problems triggered the dissolution of St Leonard's College, whose properties and staff were merged into St Salvator's College to form the United College of St Salvator and St Leonard.[15] Throughout this period student numbers were very low; for instance, when Samuel Johnson visited the university in 1773, the university had fewer than 100 students, and was in his opinion in a steady decline. He described it as \"pining in decay and struggling for life\".[24] The poverty of Scotland during this period also damaged St Andrews, as few were able to patronise the university and its colleges, and with state support being improbable, the income they received was scarce.\n\n\n\n### Modern period[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Sporting affiliations\n | University of St Andrews Athletic Union |\n| Website | st-andrews.ac.uk ![Edit this at Wikidata](image) |\n\n\nThe **University of St Andrews** (Scots: *University o St Andras*, Scottish Gaelic: *Oilthigh Chill Rìmhinn*;[6] abbreviated as **St And**, from the Latin *Sancti Andreae*, in post-nominals) is a public university in St Andrews, Scotland. It is the oldest of the four ancient universities of Scotland and, following the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, the third-oldest university in the English-speaking world. St Andrews was founded in 1413 when the Avignon Antipope Benedict XIII issued a papal bull to a small founding group of Augustinian clergy. Along with the universities of Glasgow, Aberdeen, and Edinburgh, St Andrews was part of the Scottish Enlightenment during the 18th century.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Arts University Plymouth\n* Portsmouth\n* Reading\n* Royal Agricultural\n* Solent\n* Southampton\n* Surrey\n* Sussex\n* UWE Bristol\n* Winchester\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"73b48450-66d1-4336-a785-88d87ddb1dfd","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
