In 1984, Li met with US President Ronald Reagan during Reagan's visit to China, notably discussing the status of Taiwan with the President. In 1988, Li resigned from his position as President of the People's Republic of China and was replaced by Yang Shangkun.

Jiang has been criticized for being too concerned about his personal image at home, and too conciliatory towards Russia and the United States abroad.[2] Served as General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party (1989\u20132002), Chairman of the Central Military Commission (1989\u20132004), Communist Party secretary of Shanghai (1987\u20131989). |\n| 6\n | ![](image) | **Hu Jintao**\u80e1\u9526\u6d9b(1942\u2013 )Tibet At-large (until 2008)Zhejiang At-large (from 2008) | 15 March 2003\n | 15 March 2008\n | X | Zeng Qinghong | Himself\n |\n| 15 March 2008\n | 14 March 2013\n | XI | Xi Jinping |\n| During his term in office, Hu reintroduced state control in some sectors of the economy that were relaxed by the previous administration, and has been conservative with political reforms.[3] Along with his colleague, Premier Wen Jiabao, Hu presided over nearly a decade of consistent economic growth and development that cemented China as a major world power. He sought to improve socio-economic equality domestically through the Scientific Development Concept, which aimed to build a \"Socialist Harmonious Society\" that was prosperous and free of social conflict.[4] In foreign policy, Hu advocated for \"China's peaceful development\", pursuing soft power in international relations and a business-oriented approach to diplomacy.
