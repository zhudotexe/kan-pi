He sought to improve socio-economic equality domestically through the Scientific Development Concept, which aimed to build a \"Socialist Harmonious Society\" that was prosperous and free of social conflict.[4] In foreign policy, Hu advocated for \"China's peaceful development\", pursuing soft power in international relations and a business-oriented approach to diplomacy.

He sought to improve socio-economic equality domestically through the Scientific Development Concept, which aimed to build a \"Socialist Harmonious Society\" that was prosperous and free of social conflict.[4] In foreign policy, Hu advocated for \"China's peaceful development\", pursuing soft power in international relations and a business-oriented approach to diplomacy.
