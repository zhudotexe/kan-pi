An early example is Blackpool Tower in England. The mayor of Blackpool, Sir John Bickerstaffe, was so impressed on seeing the Eiffel Tower at the 1889 exposition that he commissioned a similar tower to be built in his town. It opened in 1894 and is 158.1 m (519 ft) tall.[110] Tokyo Tower in Japan, built as a communications tower in 1958, was also inspired by the Eiffel Tower.[111]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n86. **^** \"History: Development of clear span buildings – Exhibition buildings\". *Architectural Teaching Resource*.

To bring our arguments home, imagine for a moment a giddy, ridiculous tower dominating Paris like a gigantic black smokestack, crushing under its barbaric bulk Notre Dame, the Tour Saint-Jacques, the Louvre, the Dome of les Invalides, the Arc de Triomphe, all of our humiliated monuments will disappear in this ghastly dream. And for twenty years ... we shall see stretching like a blot of ink the hateful shadow of the hateful column of bolted sheet metal.[14]\n> \n> \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe design of the Eiffel Tower is attributed to Maurice Koechlin and Émile Nouguier, two senior engineers working for the Compagnie des Établissements Eiffel. It was envisioned after discussion about a suitable centerpiece for the proposed 1889 Exposition Universelle, a world's fair to celebrate the centennial of the French Revolution. Eiffel openly acknowledged that inspiration for a tower came from the Latting Observatory built in New York City in 1853.[8] In May 1884, working at home, Koechlin made a sketch of their idea, described by him as \"a great pylon, consisting of four lattice girders standing apart at the base and coming together at the top, joined together by metal trusses at regular intervals\".[9] Eiffel initially showed little enthusiasm, but he did approve further study, and the two engineers then asked Stephen Sauvestre, the head of the company's architectural department, to contribute to the design. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLocally nicknamed \"*La dame de fer*\" (French for \"Iron Lady\"), it was constructed as the centerpiece of the 1889 World's Fair. Although initially criticised by some of France's leading artists and intellectuals for its design, it has since become a global cultural icon of France and one of the most recognisable structures in the world.[3] The tower received 5,889,000 visitors in 2022.[4] The Eiffel Tower is the most visited monument with an entrance fee in the world:[5] 6.91 million people ascended it in 2015. It was designated a *monument historique* in 1964, and was named part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site (\"Paris, Banks of the Seine\") in 1991.[6]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Eiffel Tower |\n| --- |\n| *Tour Eiffel* (French)\n |\n| ![](image)Seen from the Champ de Mars\n |\n| ![Map](image) |\n| Record height |\n| Tallest in the world from 1889 to 1930[I] |\n| General information |\n| Type | Observation towerBroadcasting tower |\n| Location | 7th arrondissement, Paris, France |\n| Coordinates | 48°51′29.6″N 2°17′40.2″E﻿ / ﻿48.858222°N 2.294500°E﻿ / 48.858222; 2.294500 |\n| Construction started | 28 January 1887; 137 years ago (28 January 1887) |\n| Completed | 15 March 1889; 135 years ago (15 March 1889) |\n| Opening | 31 March 1889; 135 years ago (31 March 1889) |\n| Owner | City of Paris, France |\n| Management | *Société d'Exploitation de la Tour Eiffel* (SETE) |\n| Height |\n| Architectural | 300 m (984 ft)[1] |\n| Tip | 330 m (1,083 ft) |\n| Top floor | 276 m (906 ft)[1] |\n| Technical details |\n| Floor count | 3[2] |\n| Lifts/elevators | 8[2] |\n| Design and construction |\n| Architect(s) | Stephen Sauvestre |\n| Structural engineer | Maurice KoechlinÉmile Nouguier |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Names engraved on the tower\nGustave Eiffel engraved on the tower the names of 72 French scientists, engineers and mathematicians in recognition of their contributions to the building of the tower. Eiffel chose this \"invocation of science\" because of his concern over the artists' protest. At the beginning of the 20th century, the engravings were painted over, but they were restored in 1986–87 by the *Société Nouvelle d'exploitation de la Tour Eiffel*, a company operating the tower.[81]\n\n\n\n### Aesthetics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Some original architectural details\nThe tower is painted in three shades: lighter at the top, getting progressively darker towards the bottom to complement the Parisian sky.[82] It was originally reddish brown; this changed in 1968 to a bronze colour known as \"Eiffel Tower Brown\".[83] In what is expected to be a temporary change, the tower is being painted gold in commemoration of the upcoming 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris.[84][85]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Foundations of the Eiffel Tower, photographed in 1887\nWork on the foundations started on 28 January 1887.[21] Those for the east and south legs were straightforward, with each leg resting on four 2 m (6.6 ft) concrete slabs, one for each of the principal girders of each leg. The west and north legs, being closer to the river Seine, were more complicated: each slab needed two piles installed by using compressed-air caissons 15 m (49 ft) long and 6 m (20 ft) in diameter driven to a depth of 22 m (72 ft)[22] to support the concrete slabs, which were 6 m (20 ft) thick. Each of these slabs supported a block of limestone with an inclined top to bear a supporting shoe for the ironwork.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The Eiffel Tower has been a subject of art, as in this cubist painting by Robert Delaunay (1911)\nOn two separate but related occasions in 1925, the con artist Victor Lustig \"sold\" the tower for scrap metal.[42] A year later, in February 1926, pilot Leon Collet was killed trying to fly under the tower. His aircraft became entangled in an aerial belonging to a wireless station.[43] A bust of Gustave Eiffel by Antoine Bourdelle was unveiled at the base of the north leg on 2 May 1929.[44] In 1930, the tower lost the title of the world's tallest structure when the Chrysler Building in New York City was completed.[45] In 1938, the decorative arcade around the first level was removed.[46]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n80. **^** Eiffel, Gustave (1900). *La Tour de Trois Cents Mètres* (in French).

It was to be dismantled in 1909, when its ownership would revert to the City of Paris. The city had planned to tear it down (part of the original contest rules for designing a tower was that it should be easy to dismantle) but as the tower proved to be valuable for many innovations in the early 20th century, particularly radio telegraphy, it was allowed to remain after the expiry of the permit, and from 1910 it also became part of the International Time Service.[34]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFamous visitors to the tower included the Prince of Wales, Sarah Bernhardt, \"Buffalo Bill\" Cody (his Wild West show was an attraction at the exposition) and Thomas Edison.[29] Eiffel invited Edison to his private apartment at the top of the tower, where Edison presented him with one of his phonographs, a new invention and one of the many highlights of the exposition.[32] Edison signed the guestbook with this message: \n\n\n> To M Eiffel the Engineer the brave builder of so gigantic and original specimen of modern Engineering from one who has the greatest respect and admiration for all Engineers including the Great Engineer the Bon Dieu, Thomas Edison.\n> \n> \n\n\nEiffel made use of his apartment at the top of the tower to carry out meteorological observations, and also used the tower to perform experiments on the action of air resistance on falling bodies.[33]\n\n\n\n### Subsequent events[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n1889 Paris Universal Exposition\n |\n| --- |\n| Site\nChamp de Mars, Trocadéro and esplanade des Invalides.

Will it not also be grandiose in its way? And why would something admirable in Egypt become hideous and ridiculous in Paris?\"[15] These criticisms were also dealt with by Édouard Lockroy in a letter of support written to Alphand, sardonically saying,[16] \"Judging by the stately swell of the rhythms, the beauty of the metaphors, the elegance of its delicate and precise style, one can tell this protest is the result of collaboration of the most famous writers and poets of our time\", and he explained that the protest was irrelevant since the project had been decided upon months before, and construction on the tower was already under way.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Lightning striking the tower in 1902\nWhen it was built, many were shocked by the tower's daring form. Eiffel was accused of trying to create something artistic with no regard to the principles of engineering. However, Eiffel and his team – experienced bridge builders – understood the importance of wind forces, and knew that if they were going to build the tallest structure in the world, they had to be sure it could withstand them.

Most of the party chose to stop at the lower levels, but a few, including the structural engineer, Émile Nouguier, the head of construction, Jean Compagnon, the President of the City Council, and reporters from *Le Figaro* and *Le Monde Illustré*, completed the ascent. At 2:35 pm, Eiffel hoisted a large Tricolour to the accompaniment of a 25-gun salute fired at the first level.[28]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n109. **^** *Notions Fondamentales Du Droit D'auteur* (in French).

Prior to the Eiffel Tower's construction, no structure had ever been constructed to a height of 300 m, or even 200 m for that matter,[13] and many people believed it was impossible. These objections were an expression of a long-standing debate in France about the relationship between architecture and engineering. It came to a head as work began at the Champ de Mars: a \"Committee of Three Hundred\" (one member for each metre of the tower's height) was formed, led by the prominent architect Charles Garnier and including some of the most important figures of the arts, such as William-Adolphe Bouguereau, Guy de Maupassant, Charles Gounod and Jules Massenet. A petition called \"Artists against the Eiffel Tower\" was sent to the Minister of Works and Commissioner for the Exposition, Adolphe Alphand, and it was published by *Le Temps* on 14 February 1887:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nTourism in Paris\n |\n| --- |\n| Landmarks | * Arc de Triomphe\n* Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel\n* Arènes de Lutèce\n* Bourse\n* Catacombs\n* Conciergerie\n* Eiffel Tower\n* Gare d'Austerlitz\n* Gare de l'Est\n* Gare de Lyon\n* Gare du Nord\n* Gare Montparnasse\n* Gare Saint-Lazare\n* Grand Palais and Petit Palais\n* Institut de France\n* *Jeanne d'Arc*\n* Les Invalides\n* Louvre Pyramid\n* Luxor Obelisk\n* Odéon\n* Opéra Bastille\n* Opéra Garnier\n* Panthéon\n* Philharmonie de Paris\n* Place Diana\n\t+ *Flame of Liberty*\n* Porte Saint-Denis\n* Porte Saint-Martin\n* Sorbonne\n* Tour Montparnasse\n |\n| Museums(list) | * Army Museum\n* Bibliothèque nationale\n* Carnavalet\n* Centre Pompidou\n* Cité des Sciences et de l'Industrie\n* Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume\n* Louis Vuitton Foundation\n* Musée des Arts décoratifs\n* Musée des Arts et Métiers\n* Musée d'Art et d'Histoire du Judaïsme\n* Musée d'Art Moderne de Paris\n* Maison de Balzac\n* Musée Bourdelle\n* Musée de la Cinémathèque\n* Musée Cognacq-Jay\n* Musée Grévin\n* Musée Guimet\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Base of the Eiffel Tower\nThe four columns of the tower each house access stairs and elevators to the first two floors, while at the south column only the elevator to the second floor restaurant is publicly accessible.\n\n\n\n#### 1st floor[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Original restaurants at the 1st floor, as viewed from inside the tower\nThe first floor is publicly accessible by elevator or stairs. \nWhen originally built, the first level contained three restaurants – one French, one Russian and one Flemish — and an \"Anglo-American Bar\". After the exposition closed, the Flemish restaurant was converted to a 250-seat theatre. Today there is the *Le 58 Tour Eiffel* restaurant and other facilities.\n\n\n\n![](image)A promenade 2.6-metre (8 ft 6 in) wide ran around the outside of the first level\n#### 2nd floor[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAt first, the legs were constructed as cantilevers, but about halfway to the first level construction was paused to create a substantial timber scaffold. This renewed concerns about the structural integrity of the tower, and sensational headlines such as \"Eiffel Suicide!\" and \"Gustave Eiffel Has Gone Mad: He Has Been Confined in an Asylum\" appeared in the tabloid press.[25] Multiple famous artists of that time, Charles Garnier and Alexander Dumas, thought poorly of the newly made tower. Charles Garnier thought it was a “ truly tragic street lamp.” Alexander Dumas said that it was like “ Odius shadow of the odious column built of rivets and iron plates extending like a black blot.” There was multiple protests over the style and the reasoning of placing it in the middle of Paris.[26] At this stage, a small \"creeper\" crane designed to move up the tower was installed in each leg. They made use of the guides for the lifts which were to be fitted in the four legs. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe nearest Paris Métro station is Bir-Hakeim and the nearest RER station is Champ de Mars-Tour Eiffel.[94] The tower itself is located at the intersection of the quai Branly and the Pont d'Iéna.\n\n\n\n![](image)Eiffel Tower seen from Branly Museum Garden\n### Popularity[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Number of visitors per year between 1889 and 2004\nMore than 300 million people have visited the tower since it was completed in 1889.[95][3] In 2015, there were 6.91 million visitors.[96] The tower is the most-visited paid monument in the world.[5] An average of 25,000 people ascend the tower every day (which can result in long queues).[97]\n\n\n\n## Illumination copyright[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Freedom of panorama § France\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIndeed, Garnier was a member of the Tower Commission that had examined the various proposals, and had raised no objection. Eiffel was similarly unworried, pointing out to a journalist that it was premature to judge the effect of the tower solely on the basis of the drawings, that the Champ de Mars was distant enough from the monuments mentioned in the protest for there to be little risk of the tower overwhelming them, and putting the aesthetic argument for the tower: \"Do not the laws of natural forces always conform to the secret laws of harmony?\"[17]\n\n\nSome of the protesters changed their minds when the tower was built; others remained unconvinced.[18] Guy de Maupassant supposedly ate lunch in the tower's restaurant every day because it was the one place in Paris where the tower was not visible.[19]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n1937 Paris International Exposition of Arts and Techniques Applied to Modern Life\n |\n| --- |\n| Site\nChamp de Mars, Trocadéro, esplanade des Invalides and banks of the Seine.

Close examination of the tower reveals a basically exponential shape.[69] All parts of the tower were overdesigned to ensure maximum resistance to wind forces. The top half was even assumed to have no gaps in the latticework.[70] In the years since it was completed, engineers have put forward various mathematical hypotheses in an attempt to explain the success of the design. The most recent, devised in 2004 after letters sent by Eiffel to the French Society of Civil Engineers in 1885 were translated into English, is described as a non-linear integral equation based on counteracting the wind pressure on any point of the tower with the tension between the construction elements at that point.[69]\n\n\nThe Eiffel Tower sways by up to 9 cm (3.5 in) in the wind.[71]\n\n\n\n### Floors[edit]\n\n\n#### Ground floor[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n31. **^** Eiffel, Gustave (1900). *La Tour de Trois Cents Mètres* (in French).

It was removed due to structural considerations; engineers had determined it was too heavy and was causing the tower to sag.[75] This restaurant was sold to an American restaurateur and transported to New York and then New Orleans. It was rebuilt on the edge of New Orleans' Garden District as a restaurant and later event hall.[76] Today there is a champagne bar.\n\n\n\n### Lifts[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe tower is 330 metres (1,083 ft) tall,[7] about the same height as an 81-storey building, and the tallest structure in Paris. Its base is square, measuring 125 metres (410 ft) on each side. During its construction, the Eiffel Tower surpassed the Washington Monument to become the tallest human-made structure in the world, a title it held for 41 years until the Chrysler Building in New York City was finished in 1930. It was the first structure in the world to surpass both the 200-metre and 300-metre mark in height. Due to the addition of a broadcasting aerial at the top of the tower in 1957, it is now taller than the Chrysler Building by 5.2 metres (17 ft). Excluding transmitters, the Eiffel Tower is the second tallest free-standing structure in France after the Millau Viaduct.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe tower has three levels for visitors, with restaurants on the first and second levels. The top level's upper platform is 276 m (906 ft) above the ground – the highest observation deck accessible to the public in the European Union. Tickets can be purchased to ascend by stairs or lift to the first and second levels. The climb from ground level to the first level is over 300 steps, as is the climb from the first level to the second, making the entire ascent a 600 step climb. Although there is a staircase to the top level, it is usually accessible only by lift. On this top, third level is a private apartment built for Gustave Eiffel's private use. He decorated it with furniture by Jean Lachaise and invited friends such as Thomas Edison.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Origin[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Trocadéro Palace\n* Pavilion of Finland\n\t+ *The Defense of the Sampo* fresco\n* Royal Pavilion of Spain\n |\n| Events | * 1900 Summer Olympics\n* Paris 1900 chess tournament\n |\n| Attractions | * Cinéorama\n* Eiffel Tower\n* Globe Céleste\n* Grande Roue\n* Mareorama\n* Passerelle Debilly\n* Pont Alexandre III\n* Rue de l'Avenir\n |\n| Urban development | * Chemin de fer de Petite Ceinture\n* Gare de Lyon\n\t+ Le Train Bleu\n* Gare d'Orsay\n* Gare du Champ de Mars\n* Gare de Javel\n* Hôtel Régina\n* Métro Line 1\n\t+ entrances\n |\n| Others | * Lafayette dollar\n* *Paris Exposition, 1900*\n* *Verset laïque et somptueux*\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThere are various scale models of the tower in the United States, including a half-scale version at the Paris Las Vegas, Nevada, one in Paris, Texas built in 1993, and two 1:3 scale models at Kings Island, located in Mason, Ohio, and Kings Dominion, Virginia, amusement parks opened in 1972 and 1975 respectively. Two 1:3 scale models can be found in China, one in Durango, Mexico that was donated by the local French community, and several across Europe.[112]\n\n\nIn 2011, the TV show *Pricing the Priceless* on the National Geographic Channel speculated that a full-size replica of the tower would cost approximately US$480 million to build.[113] This would be more than ten times the cost of the original (nearly 8 million in 1890 Francs; ~US$40 million in 2018 dollars).\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)France portal\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nSupertall structures\n |\n| --- |\n| *Italics* indicate structures under construction\n |\n| Towers | * Almaty Tower\n* Aspire Tower\n* Bailong Elevator\n* Baku TV Tower\n* Berliner Fernsehturm\n* Canton Tower\n* China Central Radio & TV Tower\n* CN Tower\n* Dragon Tower\n* Eiffel Tower\n* Emley Moor transmitting station\n* Europaturm\n* Fazilka TV Tower\n* Gerbrandy Tower\n* Indosiar Television Tower\n* Jaisalmer TV Tower\n* Jiangsu Nanjing Broadcast Television Tower\n* KCTV Tower\n* Kyiv TV Tower\n* Kuala Lumpur Tower\n* Liaoning Broadcast and TV Tower\n* Liberation Tower\n* Lotus Tower\n* Macau Tower\n* Milad Tower\n* Mumbai Television Tower\n* N Seoul Tower\n* Oriental Pearl Tower\n* Ostankino Tower\n* Pitampura TV Tower\n* Rameswaram TV Tower\n* Riga Radio and TV Tower\n* Saint Petersburg TV Tower\n* Samatra TV Tower\n* Sint-Pieters-Leeuw Tower\n* Sky Tower\n* Strat Tower\n* Sydney Tower\n* Taipei 101\n* Tallinn TV Tower\n* Tashkent Tower\n* Tbilisi TV Broadcasting Tower\n* Tianjin Radio and Television Tower\n* Tokyo Skytree\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter some debate about the exact location of the tower, a contract was signed on 8 January 1887. Eiffel signed it acting in his own capacity rather than as the representative of his company, the contract granting him 1.5 million francs toward the construction costs: less than a quarter of the estimated 6.5 million francs. Eiffel was to receive all income from the commercial exploitation of the tower during the exhibition and for the next 20 years. He later established a separate company to manage the tower, putting up half the necessary capital himself.[11]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Records\n |\n| --- |\n| Preceded byWashington Monument\n |  **World's tallest structure** 1889–1931312 m (1,024 ft) | Succeeded byChrysler Building\n |\n|  **World's tallest tower** 1889–1956\n | Succeeded byKCTV Broadcast Tower\n |\n| Preceded byKCTV Broadcast Tower\n |  **World's tallest tower** 1957–1958\n | Succeeded byTokyo Tower\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLittle progress was made until 1886, when Jules Grévy was re-elected as president of France and Édouard Lockroy was appointed as minister for trade. A budget for the exposition was passed and, on 1 May, Lockroy announced an alteration to the terms of the open competition being held for a centrepiece to the exposition, which effectively made the selection of Eiffel's design a foregone conclusion, as entries had to include a study for a 300 m (980 ft) four-sided metal tower on the Champ de Mars.[10] (A 300-metre tower was then considered a herculean engineering effort.) On 12 May, a commission was set up to examine Eiffel's scheme and its rivals, which, a month later, decided that all the proposals except Eiffel's were either impractical or lacking in details.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAccording to *The New York Times*, \"[at] a time when the [CIC] was helping finance one of the world's best-known landmarks, the Eiffel Tower, as a monument to French liberty, it was choking Haiti's economy, taking much of the young nation's income back to Paris and impairing its ability to start schools, hospitals and the other building blocks of an independent country.\"[12]\n\n\n\n### Artists' protest[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The Eiffel Tower illuminated in 2015\nThe tower and its image have been in the public domain since 1993, 70 years after Eiffel's death.[98] In June 1990 a French court ruled that a special lighting display on the tower in 1989 to mark the tower's 100th anniversary was an \"original visual creation\" protected by copyright. The Court of Cassation, France's judicial court of last resort, upheld the ruling in March 1992.[99] The *Société d'Exploitation de la Tour Eiffel* (SETE) now considers any illumination of the tower to be a separate work of art that falls under copyright.[100] As a result, the SNTE alleges that it is illegal to publish contemporary photographs of the lit tower at night without permission in France and some other countries for commercial use.[101][102] For this reason, it is often rare to find images or videos of the lit tower at night on stock image sites,[103] and media outlets rarely broadcast images or videos of it.[104]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n> Is it not true that the very conditions which give strength also conform to the hidden rules of harmony? ... Now to what phenomenon did I have to give primary concern in designing the Tower? It was wind resistance. Well then! I hold that the curvature of the monument's four outer edges, which is as mathematical calculation dictated it should be ... will give a great impression of strength and beauty, for it will reveal to the eyes of the observer the boldness of the design as a whole.[68]\n> \n> \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Illumination of the tower at night during the exposition; painted by Georges Garen [fr], 1889\nOn the second level, the French newspaper *Le Figaro* had an office and a printing press, where a special souvenir edition, *Le Figaro de la Tour*, was made. There was also a pâtisserie.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAt the top, there was a post office where visitors could send letters and postcards as a memento of their visit. Graffitists were also catered for: sheets of paper were mounted on the walls each day for visitors to record their impressions of the tower.

Depending on the ambient temperature, the top of the tower may shift away from the sun by up to 18 cm (7 in) due to thermal expansion of the metal on the side facing the sun.[67]\n\n\n\n### Wind and weather considerations[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The tower is the focal point for New Year's Eve and Bastille Day (as in this image from 2013) celebrations.\nFor its \"Countdown to the Year 2000\" celebration on 31 December 1999, flashing lights and high-powered searchlights were installed on the tower. During the last three minutes of the year, the lights were turned on starting from the base of the tower and continuing to the top to welcome 2000 with a huge fireworks show. An exhibition above a cafeteria on the first floor commemorates this event. The searchlights on top of the tower made it a beacon in Paris's night sky, and 20,000 flashing bulbs gave the tower a sparkly appearance for five minutes every hour on the hour.[58]\n\n\nThe lights sparkled blue for several nights to herald the new millennium on 31 December 2000. The sparkly lighting continued for 18 months until July 2001. The sparkling lights were turned on again on 21 June 2003, and the display was planned to last for 10 years before they needed replacing.[59]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe pinnacle height of the Eiffel Tower has changed multiple times over the years as described in the chart below.[91]\n\n\n\n\n\n| From\n | To\n | Height m\n | Height ft\n | Type of addition\n | Remarks\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1889\n | 1957\n | 312.27\n | 1,025\n | Flagpole\n | Architectural height of 300 m (980 ft) Tallest freestanding structure in the world until surpassed by the Chrysler Building in 1930.

The foundations were completed on 30 June, and the erection of the ironwork began. The visible work on-site was complemented by the enormous amount of exacting preparatory work that took place behind the scenes: the drawing office produced 1,700 general drawings and 3,629 detailed drawings of the 18,038 different parts needed.[23] The task of drawing the components was complicated by the complex angles involved in the design and the degree of precision required: the position of rivet holes was specified to within 1 mm (0.04 in) and angles worked out to one second of arc.[24] The finished components, some already riveted together into sub-assemblies, arrived on horse-drawn carts from a factory in the nearby Parisian suburb of Levallois-Perret and were first bolted together, with the bolts being replaced with rivets as construction progressed. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n1900 Paris Exposition\n |\n| --- |\n| Site\nChamp de Mars, Trocadéro, esplanade des Invalides, banks of the Seine and Bois de Vincennes.

Until the 1950s, sets of aerial wires ran from the cupola to anchors on the Avenue de Suffren and Champ de Mars. These were connected to longwave transmitters in small bunkers. In 1909, a permanent underground radio centre was built near the south pillar, which still exists today. On 20 November 1913, the Paris Observatory, using the Eiffel Tower as an aerial, exchanged wireless signals with the United States Naval Observatory, which used an aerial in Arlington County, Virginia. The object of the transmissions was to measure the difference in longitude between Paris and Washington, D.C.[90] Today, radio and digital television signals are transmitted from the Eiffel Tower.\n\n\n\n### FM radio[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA fire started in the television transmitter on 3 January 1956, damaging the top of the tower. Repairs took a year, and in 1957, the present radio aerial was added to the top.[51] In 1964, the Eiffel Tower was officially declared to be a historical monument by the Minister of Cultural Affairs, André Malraux.[52] A year later, an additional lift system was installed in the north pillar.[53]\n\n\nAccording to interviews, in 1967, Montreal Mayor Jean Drapeau negotiated a secret agreement with Charles de Gaulle for the tower to be dismantled and temporarily relocated to Montreal to serve as a landmark and tourist attraction during Expo 67. The plan was allegedly vetoed by the company operating the tower out of fear that the French government could refuse permission for the tower to be restored in its original location.[54]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFor the 1900 *Exposition Universelle*, the lifts in the east and west legs were replaced by lifts running as far as the second level constructed by the French firm Fives-Lille. These had a compensating mechanism to keep the floor level as the angle of ascent changed at the first level, and were driven by a similar hydraulic mechanism as the Otis lifts, although this was situated at the base of the tower. Hydraulic pressure was provided by pressurised accumulators located near this mechanism.[35] At the same time the lift in the north pillar was removed and replaced by a staircase to the first level. The layout of both first and second levels was modified, with the space available for visitors on the second level. The original lift in the south pillar was removed 13 years later.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe tower received its 200,000,000th guest on 28 November 2002.[60] The tower has operated at its maximum capacity of about 7 million visitors per year since 2003.[61] In 2004, the Eiffel Tower began hosting a seasonal ice rink on the first level.[62] A glass floor was installed on the first level during the 2014 refurbishment.[63]\n\n\n\n\n## Design[edit]\n\n\n### Material[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nA French bank, the *Crédit Industriel et Commercial* (CIC), helped finance the construction of the Eiffel Tower. During the period of the tower's construction, the CIC was acquiring funds from predatory loans to the National Bank of Haiti, some of which went towards the financing of the tower. These loans were connected to an indemnity controversy which saw France force Haiti's government to financially compensate French slaveowners for lost income as a result of the Haitian Revolution, and required Haiti to pay the CIC and its partner nearly half of all taxes collected on exports, \"effectively choking off the nation's primary source of income\". \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Les Deux Magots\n* Maxim's\n* Moulin de la Galette\n* Moulin Rouge\n* Paris Métro\n\t+ entrances\n\t+ Montmartre Funicular\n* Paris Musées\n* Paris syndrome\n* Paris Zoological Park\n* Pyramide inversée\n* World Heritage Centre\n |\n| Related | * List of tourist attractions in Paris\n* Art in Paris\n* Paris syndrome\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n20 March 1888:  \nCompletion of the first level\n* ![15 May 1888: Start of construction on the second stage](image)\n\n15 May 1888:  \nStart of construction on the second stage\n* ![21 August 1888: Completion of the second level](image)\n\n21 August 1888:  \nCompletion of the second level\n* ![26 December 1888: Construction of the upper stage](image)\n\n26 December 1888:  \nConstruction of the upper stage\n* ![15 March 1889: Construction of the cupola](image)\n\n15 March 1889:  \nConstruction of the cupola\n\n\n### Inauguration and the 1889 exposition[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe original lifts for the journey between the second and third levels were supplied by Léon Edoux. A pair of 81 m (266 ft) hydraulic rams were mounted on the second level, reaching nearly halfway up to the third level. One lift car was mounted on top of these rams: cables ran from the top of this car up to sheaves on the third level and back down to a second car. Each car travelled only half the distance between the second and third levels and passengers were required to change lifts halfway by means of a short gangway. The 10-ton cars each held 65 passengers.[80]\n\n\n\n### Engraved names[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of the 72 names on the Eiffel Tower\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nUpon the German occupation of Paris in 1940, the lift cables were cut by the French. The tower was closed to the public during the occupation and the lifts were not repaired until 1946.[47] In 1940, German soldiers had to climb the tower to hoist a swastika-centered Reichskriegsflagge,[48] but the flag was so large it blew away just a few hours later, and was replaced by a smaller one.[49] When visiting Paris, Hitler chose to stay on the ground. When the Allies were nearing Paris in August 1944, Hitler ordered General Dietrich von Choltitz, the military governor of Paris, to demolish the tower along with the rest of the city. Von Choltitz disobeyed the order.[50] On 25 August, before the Germans had been driven out of Paris, the German flag was replaced with a Tricolour by two men from the French Naval Museum, who narrowly beat three men led by Lucien Sarniguet, who had lowered the Tricolour on 13 June 1940 when Paris fell to the Germans.[47]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1910, Father Theodor Wulf measured radiant energy at the top and bottom of the tower. He found more at the top than expected, incidentally discovering what are known today as cosmic rays.[37] Two years later, on 4 February 1912, Austrian tailor Franz Reichelt died after jumping from the first level of the tower (a height of 57 m) to demonstrate his parachute design.[38] In 1914, at the outbreak of World War I, a radio transmitter located in the tower jammed German radio communications, seriously hindering their advance on Paris and contributing to the Allied victory at the First Battle of the Marne.[39] From 1925 to 1934, illuminated signs for Citroën adorned three of the tower's sides, making it the tallest advertising space in the world at the time.[40] In April 1935, the tower was used to make experimental low-resolution television transmissions, using a shortwave transmitter of 200 watts power. On 17 November, an improved 180-line transmitter was installed.[41]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThere was still work to be done, particularly on the lifts and facilities, and the tower was not opened to the public until nine days after the opening of the exposition on 6 May; even then, the lifts had not been completed. The tower was an instant success with the public, and nearly 30,000 visitors made the 1,710-step climb to the top before the lifts entered service on 26 May.[29]\nTickets cost 2 francs for the first level, 3 for the second, and 5 for the top, with half-price admission on Sundays,[30] and by the end of the exhibition there had been 1,896,987 visitors.[3]\n\n\nAfter dark, the tower was lit by hundreds of gas lamps, and a beacon sent out three beams of red, white and blue light. Two searchlights mounted on a circular rail were used to illuminate various buildings of the exposition. The daily opening and closing of the exposition were announced by a cannon at the top.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe imposition of copyright has been controversial. The Director of Documentation for what was then called the *Société Nouvelle d'exploitation de la Tour Eiffel* (SNTE), Stéphane Dieu, commented in 2005: \"It is really just a way to manage commercial use of the image, so that it isn't used in ways [of which] we don't approve\".[105] SNTE made over €1 million from copyright fees in 2002.[106] However, it could also be used to restrict the publication of tourist photographs of the tower at night, as well as hindering non-profit and semi-commercial publication of images of the illuminated tower.[107]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Santos-Dumont No. 5; 13 July 1901\nOn 19 October 1901, Alberto Santos-Dumont, flying his No.6 airship, won a 100,000-franc prize offered by Henri Deutsch de la Meurthe for the first person to make a flight from St. Cloud to the Eiffel Tower and back in less than half an hour.[36]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The Roux, Combaluzier & Lepape lifts during construction.\nEquipping the tower with adequate and safe passenger lifts was a major concern of the government commission overseeing the Exposition. Although some visitors could be expected to climb to the first level, or even the second, lifts clearly had to be the main means of ascent.[78]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The Otis lifts originally fitted in the north and south legs\nInstalling lifts to the second level was more of a challenge because a straight track was impossible. No French company wanted to undertake the work. The European branch of Otis Brothers & Company submitted a proposal but this was rejected: the fair's charter ruled out the use of any foreign material in the construction of the tower. The deadline for bids was extended but still no French companies put themselves forward, and eventually the contract was given to Otis in July 1887.[35] Otis were confident they would eventually be given the contract and had already started creating designs.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe motive power was moved from the water hydraulic system to a new electrically driven oil-filled hydraulic system, and the original water hydraulics were retained solely as a counterbalance system.[53] A service lift was added to the south pillar for moving small loads and maintenance personnel three years later.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nRobert Moriarty flew a Beechcraft Bonanza under the tower on 31 March 1984.[55] In 1987, A. J. Hackett made one of his first bungee jumps from the top of the Eiffel Tower, using a special cord he had helped develop. Hackett was arrested by the police.[56] On 27 October 1991, Thierry Devaux, along with mountain guide Hervé Calvayrac, performed a series of acrobatic figures while bungee jumping from the second floor of the tower. Facing the Champ de Mars, Devaux used an electric winch between figures to go back up to the second floor. When firemen arrived, he stopped after the sixth jump.[57]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t+ Brady\n* Latin Quarter\n* Le Marais\n* Montmartre\n* Montparnasse\n* Place Diana\n* Place Dauphine\n* Place de la Bastille\n* Place de la Concorde\n* Place de la Nation\n* Place de la République\n* Place des Émeutes-de-Stonewall\n* Place des États-Unis\n* Place des Pyramides\n* Place des Victoires\n* Place des Vosges\n* Place du Carrousel\n* Place du Châtelet\n* Place du Tertre\n* Place Saint-Michel\n* Place Vendôme\n* Pont Alexandre III\n* Pont d'Iéna\n* Pont de Bir-Hakeim\n* Pont des Arts\n* Pont Neuf\n* Port du Louvre\n* Rive Gauche\n* Rue Basse\n* Rue Bonaparte\n* Rue Charlemagne\n* Rue d'Argenteuil\n* Rue de la Ferronnerie\n* Rue de la Paix\n* Rue de la Sourdière\n* Rue de Montmorency\n* Rue de Richelieu\n* Rue de Rivoli\n* Rue de Vaugirard\n* Rue des Francs-Bourgeois\n* Rue des Lombards\n* Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré\n* Rue Elzévir\n* Rue Foyatier\n* Rue Molière\n* Rue Montorgueil\n* Rue Radziwill\n* Rue Rambuteau\n* Rue Mondétour\n* Rue Pastourelle\n* Rue des Rosiers\n* Rue Saint-Honoré\n* Rue Saint-Denis\n* Rue Sainte-Anne\n* Saint-Germain-des-Prés\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe second floor is publicly accessible by elevator or stairs and has a restaurant called *Le Jules Verne*, a gourmet restaurant with its own lift going up from the south column to the second level.

It opened in 1894 and is 158.1 m (519 ft) tall.[110] Tokyo Tower in Japan, built as a communications tower in 1958, was also inspired by the Eiffel Tower.[111]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n86. **^** \"History: Development of clear span buildings – Exhibition buildings\". *Architectural Teaching Resource*.

Eiffel openly acknowledged that inspiration for a tower came from the Latting Observatory built in New York City in 1853.[8] In May 1884, working at home, Koechlin made a sketch of their idea, described by him as \"a great pylon, consisting of four lattice girders standing apart at the base and coming together at the top, joined together by metal trusses at regular intervals\".[9] Eiffel initially showed little enthusiasm, but he did approve further study, and the two engineers then asked Stephen Sauvestre, the head of the company's architectural department, to contribute to the design. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLocally nicknamed \"*La dame de fer*\" (French for \"Iron Lady\"), it was constructed as the centerpiece of the 1889 World's Fair. Although initially criticised by some of France's leading artists and intellectuals for its design, it has since become a global cultural icon of France and one of the most recognisable structures in the world.[3] The tower received 5,889,000 visitors in 2022.[4] The Eiffel Tower is the most visited monument with an entrance fee in the world:[5] 6.91 million people ascended it in 2015. It was designated a *monument historique* in 1964, and was named part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site (\"Paris, Banks of the Seine\") in 1991.[6]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Eiffel Tower |\n| --- |\n| *Tour Eiffel* (French)\n |\n| ![](image)Seen from the Champ de Mars\n |\n| ![Map](image) |\n| Record height |\n| Tallest in the world from 1889 to 1930[I] |\n| General information |\n| Type | Observation towerBroadcasting tower |\n| Location | 7th arrondissement, Paris, France |\n| Coordinates | 48°51′29.6″N 2°17′40.2″E﻿ / ﻿48.858222°N 2.294500°E﻿ / 48.858222; 2.294500 |\n| Construction started | 28 January 1887; 137 years ago (28 January 1887) |\n| Completed | 15 March 1889; 135 years ago (15 March 1889) |\n| Opening | 31 March 1889; 135 years ago (31 March 1889) |\n| Owner | City of Paris, France |\n| Management | *Société d'Exploitation de la Tour Eiffel* (SETE) |\n| Height |\n| Architectural | 300 m (984 ft)[1] |\n| Tip | 330 m (1,083 ft) |\n| Top floor | 276 m (906 ft)[1] |\n| Technical details |\n| Floor count | 3[2] |\n| Lifts/elevators | 8[2] |\n| Design and construction |\n| Architect(s) | Stephen Sauvestre |\n| Structural engineer | Maurice KoechlinÉmile Nouguier |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Names engraved on the tower\nGustave Eiffel engraved on the tower the names of 72 French scientists, engineers and mathematicians in recognition of their contributions to the building of the tower. Eiffel chose this \"invocation of science\" because of his concern over the artists' protest. At the beginning of the 20th century, the engravings were painted over, but they were restored in 1986–87 by the *Société Nouvelle d'exploitation de la Tour Eiffel*, a company operating the tower.[81]\n\n\n\n### Aesthetics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Some original architectural details\nThe tower is painted in three shades: lighter at the top, getting progressively darker towards the bottom to complement the Parisian sky.[82] It was originally reddish brown; this changed in 1968 to a bronze colour known as \"Eiffel Tower Brown\".[83] In what is expected to be a temporary change, the tower is being painted gold in commemoration of the upcoming 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris.[84][85]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Foundations of the Eiffel Tower, photographed in 1887\nWork on the foundations started on 28 January 1887.[21] Those for the east and south legs were straightforward, with each leg resting on four 2 m (6.6 ft) concrete slabs, one for each of the principal girders of each leg. The west and north legs, being closer to the river Seine, were more complicated: each slab needed two piles installed by using compressed-air caissons 15 m (49 ft) long and 6 m (20 ft) in diameter driven to a depth of 22 m (72 ft)[22] to support the concrete slabs, which were 6 m (20 ft) thick. Each of these slabs supported a block of limestone with an inclined top to bear a supporting shoe for the ironwork.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The Eiffel Tower has been a subject of art, as in this cubist painting by Robert Delaunay (1911)\nOn two separate but related occasions in 1925, the con artist Victor Lustig \"sold\" the tower for scrap metal.[42] A year later, in February 1926, pilot Leon Collet was killed trying to fly under the tower. His aircraft became entangled in an aerial belonging to a wireless station.[43] A bust of Gustave Eiffel by Antoine Bourdelle was unveiled at the base of the north leg on 2 May 1929.[44] In 1930, the tower lost the title of the world's tallest structure when the Chrysler Building in New York City was completed.[45] In 1938, the decorative arcade around the first level was removed.[46]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n80. **^** Eiffel, Gustave (1900). *La Tour de Trois Cents Mètres* (in French).

It was to be dismantled in 1909, when its ownership would revert to the City of Paris. The city had planned to tear it down (part of the original contest rules for designing a tower was that it should be easy to dismantle) but as the tower proved to be valuable for many innovations in the early 20th century, particularly radio telegraphy, it was allowed to remain after the expiry of the permit, and from 1910 it also became part of the International Time Service.[34]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFamous visitors to the tower included the Prince of Wales, Sarah Bernhardt, \"Buffalo Bill\" Cody (his Wild West show was an attraction at the exposition) and Thomas Edison.[29] Eiffel invited Edison to his private apartment at the top of the tower, where Edison presented him with one of his phonographs, a new invention and one of the many highlights of the exposition.[32] Edison signed the guestbook with this message: \n\n\n> To M Eiffel the Engineer the brave builder of so gigantic and original specimen of modern Engineering from one who has the greatest respect and admiration for all Engineers including the Great Engineer the Bon Dieu, Thomas Edison.\n> \n> \n\n\nEiffel made use of his apartment at the top of the tower to carry out meteorological observations, and also used the tower to perform experiments on the action of air resistance on falling bodies.[33]\n\n\n\n### Subsequent events[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n1889 Paris Universal Exposition\n |\n| --- |\n| Site\nChamp de Mars, Trocadéro and esplanade des Invalides.

Will it not also be grandiose in its way? And why would something admirable in Egypt become hideous and ridiculous in Paris?\"[15] These criticisms were also dealt with by Édouard Lockroy in a letter of support written to Alphand, sardonically saying,[16] \"Judging by the stately swell of the rhythms, the beauty of the metaphors, the elegance of its delicate and precise style, one can tell this protest is the result of collaboration of the most famous writers and poets of our time\", and he explained that the protest was irrelevant since the project had been decided upon months before, and construction on the tower was already under way.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Lightning striking the tower in 1902\nWhen it was built, many were shocked by the tower's daring form. Eiffel was accused of trying to create something artistic with no regard to the principles of engineering. However, Eiffel and his team – experienced bridge builders – understood the importance of wind forces, and knew that if they were going to build the tallest structure in the world, they had to be sure it could withstand them.

Most of the party chose to stop at the lower levels, but a few, including the structural engineer, Émile Nouguier, the head of construction, Jean Compagnon, the President of the City Council, and reporters from *Le Figaro* and *Le Monde Illustré*, completed the ascent. At 2:35 pm, Eiffel hoisted a large Tricolour to the accompaniment of a 25-gun salute fired at the first level.[28]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n109. **^** *Notions Fondamentales Du Droit D'auteur* (in French).

Prior to the Eiffel Tower's construction, no structure had ever been constructed to a height of 300 m, or even 200 m for that matter,[13] and many people believed it was impossible. These objections were an expression of a long-standing debate in France about the relationship between architecture and engineering. It came to a head as work began at the Champ de Mars: a \"Committee of Three Hundred\" (one member for each metre of the tower's height) was formed, led by the prominent architect Charles Garnier and including some of the most important figures of the arts, such as William-Adolphe Bouguereau, Guy de Maupassant, Charles Gounod and Jules Massenet. A petition called \"Artists against the Eiffel Tower\" was sent to the Minister of Works and Commissioner for the Exposition, Adolphe Alphand, and it was published by *Le Temps* on 14 February 1887:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nTourism in Paris\n |\n| --- |\n| Landmarks | * Arc de Triomphe\n* Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel\n* Arènes de Lutèce\n* Bourse\n* Catacombs\n* Conciergerie\n* Eiffel Tower\n* Gare d'Austerlitz\n* Gare de l'Est\n* Gare de Lyon\n* Gare du Nord\n* Gare Montparnasse\n* Gare Saint-Lazare\n* Grand Palais and Petit Palais\n* Institut de France\n* *Jeanne d'Arc*\n* Les Invalides\n* Louvre Pyramid\n* Luxor Obelisk\n* Odéon\n* Opéra Bastille\n* Opéra Garnier\n* Panthéon\n* Philharmonie de Paris\n* Place Diana\n\t+ *Flame of Liberty*\n* Porte Saint-Denis\n* Porte Saint-Martin\n* Sorbonne\n* Tour Montparnasse\n |\n| Museums(list) | * Army Museum\n* Bibliothèque nationale\n* Carnavalet\n* Centre Pompidou\n* Cité des Sciences et de l'Industrie\n* Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume\n* Louis Vuitton Foundation\n* Musée des Arts décoratifs\n* Musée des Arts et Métiers\n* Musée d'Art et d'Histoire du Judaïsme\n* Musée d'Art Moderne de Paris\n* Maison de Balzac\n* Musée Bourdelle\n* Musée de la Cinémathèque\n* Musée Cognacq-Jay\n* Musée Grévin\n* Musée Guimet\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Base of the Eiffel Tower\nThe four columns of the tower each house access stairs and elevators to the first two floors, while at the south column only the elevator to the second floor restaurant is publicly accessible.\n\n\n\n#### 1st floor[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Original restaurants at the 1st floor, as viewed from inside the tower\nThe first floor is publicly accessible by elevator or stairs. \nWhen originally built, the first level contained three restaurants – one French, one Russian and one Flemish — and an \"Anglo-American Bar\".

This renewed concerns about the structural integrity of the tower, and sensational headlines such as \"Eiffel Suicide!\" and \"Gustave Eiffel Has Gone Mad: He Has Been Confined in an Asylum\" appeared in the tabloid press.[25] Multiple famous artists of that time, Charles Garnier and Alexander Dumas, thought poorly of the newly made tower. Charles Garnier thought it was a “ truly tragic street lamp.” Alexander Dumas said that it was like “ Odius shadow of the odious column built of rivets and iron plates extending like a black blot.” There was multiple protests over the style and the reasoning of placing it in the middle of Paris.[26] At this stage, a small \"creeper\" crane designed to move up the tower was installed in each leg. They made use of the guides for the lifts which were to be fitted in the four legs. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe nearest Paris Métro station is Bir-Hakeim and the nearest RER station is Champ de Mars-Tour Eiffel.[94] The tower itself is located at the intersection of the quai Branly and the Pont d'Iéna.\n\n\n\n![](image)Eiffel Tower seen from Branly Museum Garden\n### Popularity[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Number of visitors per year between 1889 and 2004\nMore than 300 million people have visited the tower since it was completed in 1889.[95][3] In 2015, there were 6.91 million visitors.[96] The tower is the most-visited paid monument in the world.[5] An average of 25,000 people ascend the tower every day (which can result in long queues).[97]\n\n\n\n## Illumination copyright[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Freedom of panorama § France\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIndeed, Garnier was a member of the Tower Commission that had examined the various proposals, and had raised no objection. Eiffel was similarly unworried, pointing out to a journalist that it was premature to judge the effect of the tower solely on the basis of the drawings, that the Champ de Mars was distant enough from the monuments mentioned in the protest for there to be little risk of the tower overwhelming them, and putting the aesthetic argument for the tower: \"Do not the laws of natural forces always conform to the secret laws of harmony?\"[17]\n\n\nSome of the protesters changed their minds when the tower was built; others remained unconvinced.[18] Guy de Maupassant supposedly ate lunch in the tower's restaurant every day because it was the one place in Paris where the tower was not visible.[19]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n1937 Paris International Exposition of Arts and Techniques Applied to Modern Life\n |\n| --- |\n| Site\nChamp de Mars, Trocadéro, esplanade des Invalides and banks of the Seine.

Close examination of the tower reveals a basically exponential shape.[69] All parts of the tower were overdesigned to ensure maximum resistance to wind forces. The top half was even assumed to have no gaps in the latticework.[70] In the years since it was completed, engineers have put forward various mathematical hypotheses in an attempt to explain the success of the design. The most recent, devised in 2004 after letters sent by Eiffel to the French Society of Civil Engineers in 1885 were translated into English, is described as a non-linear integral equation based on counteracting the wind pressure on any point of the tower with the tension between the construction elements at that point.[69]\n\n\nThe Eiffel Tower sways by up to 9 cm (3.5 in) in the wind.[71]\n\n\n\n### Floors[edit]\n\n\n#### Ground floor[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n31. **^** Eiffel, Gustave (1900). *La Tour de Trois Cents Mètres* (in French).

It was removed due to structural considerations; engineers had determined it was too heavy and was causing the tower to sag.[75] This restaurant was sold to an American restaurateur and transported to New York and then New Orleans. It was rebuilt on the edge of New Orleans' Garden District as a restaurant and later event hall.[76] Today there is a champagne bar.\n\n\n\n### Lifts[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe tower is 330 metres (1,083 ft) tall,[7] about the same height as an 81-storey building, and the tallest structure in Paris. Its base is square, measuring 125 metres (410 ft) on each side. During its construction, the Eiffel Tower surpassed the Washington Monument to become the tallest human-made structure in the world, a title it held for 41 years until the Chrysler Building in New York City was finished in 1930. It was the first structure in the world to surpass both the 200-metre and 300-metre mark in height. Due to the addition of a broadcasting aerial at the top of the tower in 1957, it is now taller than the Chrysler Building by 5.2 metres (17 ft). Excluding transmitters, the Eiffel Tower is the second tallest free-standing structure in France after the Millau Viaduct.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe tower has three levels for visitors, with restaurants on the first and second levels. The top level's upper platform is 276 m (906 ft) above the ground – the highest observation deck accessible to the public in the European Union. Tickets can be purchased to ascend by stairs or lift to the first and second levels. The climb from ground level to the first level is over 300 steps, as is the climb from the first level to the second, making the entire ascent a 600 step climb. Although there is a staircase to the top level, it is usually accessible only by lift. On this top, third level is a private apartment built for Gustave Eiffel's private use. He decorated it with furniture by Jean Lachaise and invited friends such as Thomas Edison.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Origin[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Trocadéro Palace\n* Pavilion of Finland\n\t+ *The Defense of the Sampo* fresco\n* Royal Pavilion of Spain\n |\n| Events | * 1900 Summer Olympics\n* Paris 1900 chess tournament\n |\n| Attractions | * Cinéorama\n* Eiffel Tower\n* Globe Céleste\n* Grande Roue\n* Mareorama\n* Passerelle Debilly\n* Pont Alexandre III\n* Rue de l'Avenir\n |\n| Urban development | * Chemin de fer de Petite Ceinture\n* Gare de Lyon\n\t+ Le Train Bleu\n* Gare d'Orsay\n* Gare du Champ de Mars\n* Gare de Javel\n* Hôtel Régina\n* Métro Line 1\n\t+ entrances\n |\n| Others | * Lafayette dollar\n* *Paris Exposition, 1900*\n* *Verset laïque et somptueux*\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThere are various scale models of the tower in the United States, including a half-scale version at the Paris Las Vegas, Nevada, one in Paris, Texas built in 1993, and two 1:3 scale models at Kings Island, located in Mason, Ohio, and Kings Dominion, Virginia, amusement parks opened in 1972 and 1975 respectively. Two 1:3 scale models can be found in China, one in Durango, Mexico that was donated by the local French community, and several across Europe.[112]\n\n\nIn 2011, the TV show *Pricing the Priceless* on the National Geographic Channel speculated that a full-size replica of the tower would cost approximately US$480 million to build.[113] This would be more than ten times the cost of the original (nearly 8 million in 1890 Francs; ~US$40 million in 2018 dollars).\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)France portal\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nSupertall structures\n |\n| --- |\n| *Italics* indicate structures under construction\n |\n| Towers | * Almaty Tower\n* Aspire Tower\n* Bailong Elevator\n* Baku TV Tower\n* Berliner Fernsehturm\n* Canton Tower\n* China Central Radio & TV Tower\n* CN Tower\n* Dragon Tower\n* Eiffel Tower\n* Emley Moor transmitting station\n* Europaturm\n* Fazilka TV Tower\n* Gerbrandy Tower\n* Indosiar Television Tower\n* Jaisalmer TV Tower\n* Jiangsu Nanjing Broadcast Television Tower\n* KCTV Tower\n* Kyiv TV Tower\n* Kuala Lumpur Tower\n* Liaoning Broadcast and TV Tower\n* Liberation Tower\n* Lotus Tower\n* Macau Tower\n* Milad Tower\n* Mumbai Television Tower\n* N Seoul Tower\n* Oriental Pearl Tower\n* Ostankino Tower\n* Pitampura TV Tower\n* Rameswaram TV Tower\n* Riga Radio and TV Tower\n* Saint Petersburg TV Tower\n* Samatra TV Tower\n* Sint-Pieters-Leeuw Tower\n* Sky Tower\n* Strat Tower\n* Sydney Tower\n* Taipei 101\n* Tallinn TV Tower\n* Tashkent Tower\n* Tbilisi TV Broadcasting Tower\n* Tianjin Radio and Television Tower\n* Tokyo Skytree\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter some debate about the exact location of the tower, a contract was signed on 8 January 1887. Eiffel signed it acting in his own capacity rather than as the representative of his company, the contract granting him 1.5 million francs toward the construction costs: less than a quarter of the estimated 6.5 million francs. Eiffel was to receive all income from the commercial exploitation of the tower during the exhibition and for the next 20 years. He later established a separate company to manage the tower, putting up half the necessary capital himself.[11]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Records\n |\n| --- |\n| Preceded byWashington Monument\n |  **World's tallest structure** 1889–1931312 m (1,024 ft) | Succeeded byChrysler Building\n |\n|  **World's tallest tower** 1889–1956\n | Succeeded byKCTV Broadcast Tower\n |\n| Preceded byKCTV Broadcast Tower\n |  **World's tallest tower** 1957–1958\n | Succeeded byTokyo Tower\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLittle progress was made until 1886, when Jules Grévy was re-elected as president of France and Édouard Lockroy was appointed as minister for trade. A budget for the exposition was passed and, on 1 May, Lockroy announced an alteration to the terms of the open competition being held for a centrepiece to the exposition, which effectively made the selection of Eiffel's design a foregone conclusion, as entries had to include a study for a 300 m (980 ft) four-sided metal tower on the Champ de Mars.[10] (A 300-metre tower was then considered a herculean engineering effort.) On 12 May, a commission was set up to examine Eiffel's scheme and its rivals, which, a month later, decided that all the proposals except Eiffel's were either impractical or lacking in details.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAccording to *The New York Times*, \"[at] a time when the [CIC] was helping finance one of the world's best-known landmarks, the Eiffel Tower, as a monument to French liberty, it was choking Haiti's economy, taking much of the young nation's income back to Paris and impairing its ability to start schools, hospitals and the other building blocks of an independent country.\"[12]\n\n\n\n### Artists' protest[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The Eiffel Tower illuminated in 2015\nThe tower and its image have been in the public domain since 1993, 70 years after Eiffel's death.[98] In June 1990 a French court ruled that a special lighting display on the tower in 1989 to mark the tower's 100th anniversary was an \"original visual creation\" protected by copyright. The Court of Cassation, France's judicial court of last resort, upheld the ruling in March 1992.[99] The *Société d'Exploitation de la Tour Eiffel* (SETE) now considers any illumination of the tower to be a separate work of art that falls under copyright.[100] As a result, the SNTE alleges that it is illegal to publish contemporary photographs of the lit tower at night without permission in France and some other countries for commercial use.[101][102] For this reason, it is often rare to find images or videos of the lit tower at night on stock image sites,[103] and media outlets rarely broadcast images or videos of it.[104]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n> Is it not true that the very conditions which give strength also conform to the hidden rules of harmony? ... Now to what phenomenon did I have to give primary concern in designing the Tower? It was wind resistance. Well then! I hold that the curvature of the monument's four outer edges, which is as mathematical calculation dictated it should be ... will give a great impression of strength and beauty, for it will reveal to the eyes of the observer the boldness of the design as a whole.[68]\n> \n> \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Illumination of the tower at night during the exposition; painted by Georges Garen [fr], 1889\nOn the second level, the French newspaper *Le Figaro* had an office and a printing press, where a special souvenir edition, *Le Figaro de la Tour*, was made. There was also a pâtisserie.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAt the top, there was a post office where visitors could send letters and postcards as a memento of their visit. Graffitists were also catered for: sheets of paper were mounted on the walls each day for visitors to record their impressions of the tower.

Although construction involved 300 on-site employees,[21] due to Eiffel's safety precautions and the use of movable gangways, guardrails and screens, only one person died.[27]\n\n\n\n\n* ![18 July 1887: The start of the erection of the metalwork](image)\n\n18 July 1887:  \nThe start of the erection of the metalwork\n* ![7 December 1887: Construction of the legs with scaffolding](image)\n\n7 December 1887:  \nConstruction of the legs with scaffolding\n* ![20 March 1888: Completion of the first level](image)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n> [n]ot only the art of the modern engineer, but also the century of Industry and Science in which we are living, and for which the way was prepared by the great scientific movement of the eighteenth century and by the Revolution of 1789, to which this monument will be built as an expression of France's gratitude.[10]\n> \n> \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Saint-Germain l'Auxerrois\n* Saint-Gervais-Saint-Protais\n* Tour Saint-Jacques\n* Saint-Jean de Montmartre\n* Saint-Paul-Saint-Louis\n* Saint-Pierre de Montmartre\n* Saint-Roch\n* Saint-Sulpice\n* Saint-Vincent-de-Paul\n* Sainte-Chapelle\n* Sainte-Clotilde\n* Sainte-Trinité\n* Temple du Marais\n* Val-de-Grâce\n |\n| Hôtels particuliersand palaces | * Élysée Palace\n* Hôtel de Beauvais\n* Hôtel de Charost\n* Hôtel de Crillon\n* Hôtel d'Estrées\n* Hôtel de la Païva\n* Hôtel de Pontalba\n* Hôtel de Sens\n* Hôtel de Soubise\n* Hôtel de Sully\n* Hôtel de Ville\n* Hôtel Lambert\n* Hôtel Matignon\n* Luxembourg Palace\n\t+ Petit Luxembourg\n* Palais Bourbon\n* Palais de Justice\n\t+ Palais de la Cité\n* Palais-Royal\n |\n| Bridges, streets,areas, squaresand waterways | * Avenue de l'Opéra\n* Avenue Foch\n* Avenue George V\n* Boulevard de la Madeleine\n* Boulevard de Sébastopol\n* Canal de l'Ourcq\n* Canal Saint-Martin\n* Champ de Mars\n* Champs-Élysées\n* Covered passages\n\t+ Galerie Véro-Dodat\n\t+ Choiseul\n\t+ Panoramas\n\t+ Galerie Vivienne\n\t+ Havre\n\t+ Jouffroy\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe copyright claim itself has never been tested in courts to date, according to a 2014 article in the *Art Law Journal*, and there has never been an attempt to track down millions of people who have posted and shared their images of the illuminated tower on the Internet worldwide. It added, however, that permissive situation may arise on commercial use of such images, like in a magazine, on a film poster, or on product packaging.[108]\n\n\nFrench doctrine and jurisprudence allows pictures incorporating a copyrighted work as long as their presence is incidental or accessory to the subject being represented,[109] a reasoning akin to the *de minimis* rule. Therefore, SETE may be unable to claim copyright on photographs of Paris which happen to include the lit tower.\n\n\n\n## Replicas[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Eiffel Tower replicas\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)The Eiffel Tower from below\nThe puddle iron (wrought iron) of the Eiffel Tower weighs 7,300 tonnes,[64] and the addition of lifts, shops and antennae have brought the total weight to approximately 10,100 tonnes.[65] As a demonstration of the economy of design, if the 7,300 tonnes of metal in the structure were melted down, it would fill the square base, 125 metres (410 ft) on each side, to a depth of only 6.25 cm (2.46 in) assuming the density of the metal to be 7.8 tonnes per cubic metre.[66] Additionally, a cubic box surrounding the tower (324 m × 125 m × 125 m) would contain 6,200 tonnes of air, weighing almost as much as the iron itself. Depending on the ambient temperature, the top of the tower may shift away from the sun by up to 18 cm (7 in) due to thermal expansion of the metal on the side facing the sun.[67]\n\n\n\n### Wind and weather considerations[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The tower is the focal point for New Year's Eve and Bastille Day (as in this image from 2013) celebrations.\nFor its \"Countdown to the Year 2000\" celebration on 31 December 1999, flashing lights and high-powered searchlights were installed on the tower. During the last three minutes of the year, the lights were turned on starting from the base of the tower and continuing to the top to welcome 2000 with a huge fireworks show. An exhibition above a cafeteria on the first floor commemorates this event. The searchlights on top of the tower made it a beacon in Paris's night sky, and 20,000 flashing bulbs gave the tower a sparkly appearance for five minutes every hour on the hour.[58]\n\n\nThe lights sparkled blue for several nights to herald the new millennium on 31 December 2000. The sparkly lighting continued for 18 months until July 2001. The sparkling lights were turned on again on 21 June 2003, and the display was planned to last for 10 years before they needed replacing.[59]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe pinnacle height of the Eiffel Tower has changed multiple times over the years as described in the chart below.[91]\n\n\n\n\n\n| From\n | To\n | Height m\n | Height ft\n | Type of addition\n | Remarks\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1889\n | 1957\n | 312.27\n | 1,025\n | Flagpole\n | Architectural height of 300 m (980 ft) Tallest freestanding structure in the world until surpassed by the Chrysler Building in 1930.

The foundations were completed on 30 June, and the erection of the ironwork began. The visible work on-site was complemented by the enormous amount of exacting preparatory work that took place behind the scenes: the drawing office produced 1,700 general drawings and 3,629 detailed drawings of the 18,038 different parts needed.[23] The task of drawing the components was complicated by the complex angles involved in the design and the degree of precision required: the position of rivet holes was specified to within 1 mm (0.04 in) and angles worked out to one second of arc.[24] The finished components, some already riveted together into sub-assemblies, arrived on horse-drawn carts from a factory in the nearby Parisian suburb of Levallois-Perret and were first bolted together, with the bolts being replaced with rivets as construction progressed. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n1900 Paris Exposition\n |\n| --- |\n| Site\nChamp de Mars, Trocadéro, esplanade des Invalides, banks of the Seine and Bois de Vincennes.

Until the 1950s, sets of aerial wires ran from the cupola to anchors on the Avenue de Suffren and Champ de Mars. These were connected to longwave transmitters in small bunkers. In 1909, a permanent underground radio centre was built near the south pillar, which still exists today. On 20 November 1913, the Paris Observatory, using the Eiffel Tower as an aerial, exchanged wireless signals with the United States Naval Observatory, which used an aerial in Arlington County, Virginia. The object of the transmissions was to measure the difference in longitude between Paris and Washington, D.C.[90] Today, radio and digital television signals are transmitted from the Eiffel Tower.\n\n\n\n### FM radio[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA fire started in the television transmitter on 3 January 1956, damaging the top of the tower. Repairs took a year, and in 1957, the present radio aerial was added to the top.[51] In 1964, the Eiffel Tower was officially declared to be a historical monument by the Minister of Cultural Affairs, André Malraux.[52] A year later, an additional lift system was installed in the north pillar.[53]\n\n\nAccording to interviews, in 1967, Montreal Mayor Jean Drapeau negotiated a secret agreement with Charles de Gaulle for the tower to be dismantled and temporarily relocated to Montreal to serve as a landmark and tourist attraction during Expo 67. The plan was allegedly vetoed by the company operating the tower out of fear that the French government could refuse permission for the tower to be restored in its original location.[54]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFor the 1900 *Exposition Universelle*, the lifts in the east and west legs were replaced by lifts running as far as the second level constructed by the French firm Fives-Lille. These had a compensating mechanism to keep the floor level as the angle of ascent changed at the first level, and were driven by a similar hydraulic mechanism as the Otis lifts, although this was situated at the base of the tower. Hydraulic pressure was provided by pressurised accumulators located near this mechanism.[35] At the same time the lift in the north pillar was removed and replaced by a staircase to the first level. The layout of both first and second levels was modified, with the space available for visitors on the second level. The original lift in the south pillar was removed 13 years later.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe tower received its 200,000,000th guest on 28 November 2002.[60] The tower has operated at its maximum capacity of about 7 million visitors per year since 2003.[61] In 2004, the Eiffel Tower began hosting a seasonal ice rink on the first level.[62] A glass floor was installed on the first level during the 2014 refurbishment.[63]\n\n\n\n\n## Design[edit]\n\n\n### Material[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nA French bank, the *Crédit Industriel et Commercial* (CIC), helped finance the construction of the Eiffel Tower. During the period of the tower's construction, the CIC was acquiring funds from predatory loans to the National Bank of Haiti, some of which went towards the financing of the tower. These loans were connected to an indemnity controversy which saw France force Haiti's government to financially compensate French slaveowners for lost income as a result of the Haitian Revolution, and required Haiti to pay the CIC and its partner nearly half of all taxes collected on exports, \"effectively choking off the nation's primary source of income\". \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Les Deux Magots\n* Maxim's\n* Moulin de la Galette\n* Moulin Rouge\n* Paris Métro\n\t+ entrances\n\t+ Montmartre Funicular\n* Paris Musées\n* Paris syndrome\n* Paris Zoological Park\n* Pyramide inversée\n* World Heritage Centre\n |\n| Related | * List of tourist attractions in Paris\n* Art in Paris\n* Paris syndrome\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n20 March 1888:  \nCompletion of the first level\n* ![15 May 1888: Start of construction on the second stage](image)\n\n15 May 1888:  \nStart of construction on the second stage\n* ![21 August 1888: Completion of the second level](image)\n\n21 August 1888:  \nCompletion of the second level\n* ![26 December 1888: Construction of the upper stage](image)\n\n26 December 1888:  \nConstruction of the upper stage\n* ![15 March 1889: Construction of the cupola](image)\n\n15 March 1889:  \nConstruction of the cupola\n\n\n### Inauguration and the 1889 exposition[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe original lifts for the journey between the second and third levels were supplied by Léon Edoux. A pair of 81 m (266 ft) hydraulic rams were mounted on the second level, reaching nearly halfway up to the third level. One lift car was mounted on top of these rams: cables ran from the top of this car up to sheaves on the third level and back down to a second car. Each car travelled only half the distance between the second and third levels and passengers were required to change lifts halfway by means of a short gangway. The 10-ton cars each held 65 passengers.[80]\n\n\n\n### Engraved names[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of the 72 names on the Eiffel Tower\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nUpon the German occupation of Paris in 1940, the lift cables were cut by the French. The tower was closed to the public during the occupation and the lifts were not repaired until 1946.[47] In 1940, German soldiers had to climb the tower to hoist a swastika-centered Reichskriegsflagge,[48] but the flag was so large it blew away just a few hours later, and was replaced by a smaller one.[49] When visiting Paris, Hitler chose to stay on the ground. When the Allies were nearing Paris in August 1944, Hitler ordered General Dietrich von Choltitz, the military governor of Paris, to demolish the tower along with the rest of the city. Von Choltitz disobeyed the order.[50] On 25 August, before the Germans had been driven out of Paris, the German flag was replaced with a Tricolour by two men from the French Naval Museum, who narrowly beat three men led by Lucien Sarniguet, who had lowered the Tricolour on 13 June 1940 when Paris fell to the Germans.[47]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1910, Father Theodor Wulf measured radiant energy at the top and bottom of the tower. He found more at the top than expected, incidentally discovering what are known today as cosmic rays.[37] Two years later, on 4 February 1912, Austrian tailor Franz Reichelt died after jumping from the first level of the tower (a height of 57 m) to demonstrate his parachute design.[38] In 1914, at the outbreak of World War I, a radio transmitter located in the tower jammed German radio communications, seriously hindering their advance on Paris and contributing to the Allied victory at the First Battle of the Marne.[39] From 1925 to 1934, illuminated signs for Citroën adorned three of the tower's sides, making it the tallest advertising space in the world at the time.[40] In April 1935, the tower was used to make experimental low-resolution television transmissions, using a shortwave transmitter of 200 watts power. On 17 November, an improved 180-line transmitter was installed.[41]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThere was still work to be done, particularly on the lifts and facilities, and the tower was not opened to the public until nine days after the opening of the exposition on 6 May; even then, the lifts had not been completed. The tower was an instant success with the public, and nearly 30,000 visitors made the 1,710-step climb to the top before the lifts entered service on 26 May.[29]\nTickets cost 2 francs for the first level, 3 for the second, and 5 for the top, with half-price admission on Sundays,[30] and by the end of the exhibition there had been 1,896,987 visitors.[3]\n\n\nAfter dark, the tower was lit by hundreds of gas lamps, and a beacon sent out three beams of red, white and blue light. Two searchlights mounted on a circular rail were used to illuminate various buildings of the exposition. The daily opening and closing of the exposition were announced by a cannon at the top.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe imposition of copyright has been controversial. The Director of Documentation for what was then called the *Société Nouvelle d'exploitation de la Tour Eiffel* (SNTE), Stéphane Dieu, commented in 2005: \"It is really just a way to manage commercial use of the image, so that it isn't used in ways [of which] we don't approve\".[105] SNTE made over €1 million from copyright fees in 2002.[106] However, it could also be used to restrict the publication of tourist photographs of the tower at night, as well as hindering non-profit and semi-commercial publication of images of the illuminated tower.[107]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Santos-Dumont No. 5; 13 July 1901\nOn 19 October 1901, Alberto Santos-Dumont, flying his No.6 airship, won a 100,000-franc prize offered by Henri Deutsch de la Meurthe for the first person to make a flight from St. Cloud to the Eiffel Tower and back in less than half an hour.[36]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The Roux, Combaluzier & Lepape lifts during construction.\nEquipping the tower with adequate and safe passenger lifts was a major concern of the government commission overseeing the Exposition. Although some visitors could be expected to climb to the first level, or even the second, lifts clearly had to be the main means of ascent.[78]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The Otis lifts originally fitted in the north and south legs\nInstalling lifts to the second level was more of a challenge because a straight track was impossible. No French company wanted to undertake the work. The European branch of Otis Brothers & Company submitted a proposal but this was rejected: the fair's charter ruled out the use of any foreign material in the construction of the tower. The deadline for bids was extended but still no French companies put themselves forward, and eventually the contract was given to Otis in July 1887.[35] Otis were confident they would eventually be given the contract and had already started creating designs.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe motive power was moved from the water hydraulic system to a new electrically driven oil-filled hydraulic system, and the original water hydraulics were retained solely as a counterbalance system.[53] A service lift was added to the south pillar for moving small loads and maintenance personnel three years later.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nRobert Moriarty flew a Beechcraft Bonanza under the tower on 31 March 1984.[55] In 1987, A. J. Hackett made one of his first bungee jumps from the top of the Eiffel Tower, using a special cord he had helped develop. Hackett was arrested by the police.[56] On 27 October 1991, Thierry Devaux, along with mountain guide Hervé Calvayrac, performed a series of acrobatic figures while bungee jumping from the second floor of the tower. Facing the Champ de Mars, Devaux used an electric winch between figures to go back up to the second floor. When firemen arrived, he stopped after the sixth jump.[57]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t+ Brady\n* Latin Quarter\n* Le Marais\n* Montmartre\n* Montparnasse\n* Place Diana\n* Place Dauphine\n* Place de la Bastille\n* Place de la Concorde\n* Place de la Nation\n* Place de la République\n* Place des Émeutes-de-Stonewall\n* Place des États-Unis\n* Place des Pyramides\n* Place des Victoires\n* Place des Vosges\n* Place du Carrousel\n* Place du Châtelet\n* Place du Tertre\n* Place Saint-Michel\n* Place Vendôme\n* Pont Alexandre III\n* Pont d'Iéna\n* Pont de Bir-Hakeim\n* Pont des Arts\n* Pont Neuf\n* Port du Louvre\n* Rive Gauche\n* Rue Basse\n* Rue Bonaparte\n* Rue Charlemagne\n* Rue d'Argenteuil\n* Rue de la Ferronnerie\n* Rue de la Paix\n* Rue de la Sourdière\n* Rue de Montmorency\n* Rue de Richelieu\n* Rue de Rivoli\n* Rue de Vaugirard\n* Rue des Francs-Bourgeois\n* Rue des Lombards\n* Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré\n* Rue Elzévir\n* Rue Foyatier\n* Rue Molière\n* Rue Montorgueil\n* Rue Radziwill\n* Rue Rambuteau\n* Rue Mondétour\n* Rue Pastourelle\n* Rue des Rosiers\n* Rue Saint-Honoré\n* Rue Saint-Denis\n* Rue Sainte-Anne\n* Saint-Germain-des-Prés\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe second floor is publicly accessible by elevator or stairs and has a restaurant called *Le Jules Verne*, a gourmet restaurant with its own lift going up from the south column to the second level.

Located on the foreshore of Sydney Harbour, it is widely regarded as one of the world's most famous and distinctive buildings and a masterpiece of 20th-century architecture.[3][4]\n\n\nDesigned by Danish architect Jørn Utzon, but completed by an Australian architectural team headed by Peter Hall, the building was formally opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 20 October 1973,[5] 16 years after Utzon's 1957 selection as winner of an international design competition. The Government of New South Wales, led by the premier, Joseph Cahill, authorised work to begin in 1958 with Utzon directing construction. The government's decision to build Utzon's design is often overshadowed by circumstances that followed, including cost and scheduling overruns as well as the architect's ultimate resignation.[6]\n\n\nThe building and its surrounds occupy the whole of Bennelong Point on Sydney Harbour, between Sydney Cove and Farm Cove, adjacent to the Sydney central business district and the Royal Botanic Gardens, and near to the Sydney Harbour Bridge.\n\n\nThe building comprises multiple performance venues, which together host well over 1,500 performances annually, attended by more than 1.2 million people.[7] Performances are presented by numerous performing artists, including three resident companies: Opera Australia, the Sydney Theatre Company and the Sydney Symphony Orchestra. As one of the most popular visitor attractions in Australia, the site is visited by more than eight million people annually, and approximately 350,000 visitors take a guided tour of the building each year.[8] The building is managed by the Sydney Opera House Trust, an agency of the New South Wales State Government.\n\n\nOn 28 June 2007, the Sydney Opera House became a UNESCO World Heritage Site,[9] having been listed on the (now defunct) Register of the National Estate since 1980, the National Trust of Australia register since 1983, the City of Sydney Heritage Inventory since 2000, the New South Wales State Heritage Register since 2003, and the Australian National Heritage List since 2005.[10][11] The Opera House was also a finalist in the *New7Wonders of the World* campaign list.[12][13]\n\n\n\n\n## Description[edit]\n\n\nThe facility features a modern expressionist design, with a series of large precast concrete \"shells\",[14] each composed of sections of a sphere of 75.2 metres (246 ft 8.6 in) radius,[15] forming the roofs of the structure, set on a monumental podium. The building covers 1.8 hectares (4.4 acres) of land and is 183 m (600 ft) long and 120 m (394 ft) wide at its widest point. It is supported on 588 concrete piers sunk as much as 25 m (82 ft) below sea level. The highest roof point is 67 metres above sea-level which is the same height as that of a 22-storey building. The roof is made of 2,194 pre-cast concrete sections, which weigh up to 15 tonnes each.[16]\n\n\nAlthough the roof structures are commonly referred to as \"shells\" (as in this article), they are precast concrete panels supported by precast concrete ribs, not shells in a strictly structural sense.[17] Though the shells appear uniformly white from a distance, they actually feature a subtle chevron pattern composed of 1,056,006 tiles in two colours: glossy white and matte cream. The tiles were manufactured by the Swedish company Höganäs AB which generally produced stoneware tiles for the paper-mill industry.[18]\n\n\nApart from the tile of the shells and the glass curtain walls of the foyer spaces, the building's exterior is largely clad with aggregate panels composed of pink granite quarried at Tarana. Significant interior surface treatments also include off-form concrete, Australian white birch plywood supplied from Wauchope in northern New South Wales, and brush box glulam.[19]\n\n\nOf the two larger spaces, the Concert Hall is in the western group of shells, the Joan Sutherland Theatre in the eastern group. The scale of the shells was chosen to reflect the internal height requirements, with low entrance spaces, rising over the seating areas up to the high stage towers. The smaller venues (the Drama Theatre, the Playhouse and the Studio) are within the podium, beneath the Concert Hall. A smaller group of shells set to the western side of the Monumental Steps houses the Bennelong Restaurant. The podium is surrounded by substantial open public spaces, and the large stone-paved forecourt area with the adjacent monumental steps is regularly used as a performance space.\n\n\n\n### Performance venues and facilities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The main Concert Hall\n![](image)Joan Sutherland Theatre interior\n![](image)The Bennelong Restaurant, located at the southernmost sailThe Sydney Opera House includes a number of performance venues:[20]\n\n\n* **Concert Hall**: With 2,679 seats, the home of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra and used by a large number of other concert presenters. It contains the Sydney Opera House Grand Organ, the largest mechanical tracker action organ in the world, with over 10,000 pipes.[21]\n* **Joan Sutherland Theatre**: A proscenium theatre with 1,507 seats,[22] the Sydney home of Opera Australia and The Australian Ballet. Until 17 October 2012 it was known as the Opera Theatre.[23][24]\n* **Drama Theatre**: A proscenium theatre with 544 seats, used by the Sydney Theatre Company and other dance and theatrical presenters.\n* **Playhouse**: A non-proscenium end-stage theatre with 398 seats.\n* **Studio**: A flexible space with 280 permanent seats (some of which can be folded up) and a maximum capacity of 400, depending on configuration.\n* **Utzon Room**: A small multi-purpose venue for parties, corporate functions and small productions (such as chamber music performances).\n* **Recording Studio**\n* **Outdoor Forecourt**: A flexible open-air venue with a wide range of configuration options, including the possibility of utilising the Monumental Steps as audience seating, used for a range of community events and major outdoor performances.\n\n\nOther areas (for example the northern and western foyers) are also used for performances on an occasional basis. Venues are also used for conferences, ceremonies and social functions.\n\n\n\n### Other facilities[edit]\n\n\nThe building also houses a recording studio, retail shops, cafes, restaurants, bars including the Opera Bar and Opera Kitchen. Guided tours are available, including a frequent tour of the front-of-house spaces, and a daily backstage tour that takes visitors backstage to see areas normally reserved for performers and crew members.\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Construction history[edit]\n\n\n#### Origins[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bennelong Point with tram depot in the 1920s (top left-hand side of photograph), during the building of Sydney Harbour Bridge (foreground)\nPlanning began in the late 1940s when Eugene Goossens, the Director of the New South Wales State Conservatorium of Music, lobbied for a suitable venue for large theatrical productions. The normal venue for such productions, the Sydney Town Hall, was not considered large enough. By 1954, Goossens succeeded in gaining the support of New South Wales Premier Joseph Cahill, who called for designs for a dedicated opera house. It was also Goossens who insisted that Bennelong Point be the site: Cahill had wanted it to be on or near Wynyard Railway Station in the northwest of the central business district.[25]\n\n\nAn international design competition was launched by Cahill on 13 September 1955 and received 233 entries, representing architects from 32 countries. The criteria specified a large hall seating 3,000 and a small hall for 1,200 people, each to be designed for different uses, including full-scale operas, orchestral and choral concerts, mass meetings, lectures, ballet performances, and other presentations.[26]\n\n\n\n![](image)Utzon's initial sketches in 1957\nThe winner, announced in 1957, was Danish architect Jørn Utzon. Utzon's design was selected by Finnish-American architect Eero Saarinen from a final cut of 30 rejects.[27] The runner-up was a Philadelphia-based team assembled by Robert Geddes and George Qualls, both teaching at the University of Pennsylvania School of Design. They brought together a band of Penn faculty and friends from Philadelphia architectural offices, including Melvin Brecher, Warren Cunningham, Joseph Marzella, Walter Wiseman, and Leon Loschetter. Geddes, Brecher, Qualls, and Cunningham went on to found the firm GBQC Architects. The grand prize was 5,000 Australian pounds.[28] Utzon visited Sydney in 1957 to help supervise the project.[29] His office moved to Palm Beach, Sydney in February 1963.[30]\n\n\nUtzon received the Pritzker Architecture Prize, architecture's highest honour, in 2003.[31] The Pritzker Prize citation read:\n\n\n\n\n> There is no doubt that the Sydney Opera House is his masterpiece. It is one of the great iconic buildings of the 20th century, an image of great beauty that has become known throughout the world – a symbol for not only a city but a whole country and continent.\n> \n> \n\n\n#### Design and construction[edit]\n\n\nThe Fort Macquarie Tram Depot, occupying the site at the time of these plans, was demolished in 1958 and construction began in March 1959. It was built in four stages: stage I (1957–1959) was planning out the building; stage II (1959–1963) consisted of building the upper podium; stage III (1963–1967) the construction of the outer shells; stage IV (1967–1973) interior design and construction.\n\n\n\n#### Stage I: Podium[edit]\n\n\nStage I commenced on 2 March 1959 with the construction firm Civil & Civic, monitored by the engineers Ove Arup and Partners.[32] The government had pushed for work to begin early, fearing that funding, or public opinion, might turn against them. However, Utzon had still not completed the final designs. Major structural issues still remained unresolved. By 23 January 1961, work was running 47 weeks behind,[32] mainly because of unexpected difficulties (inclement weather, unexpected difficulty diverting stormwater, construction beginning before proper construction drawings had been prepared, changes of original contract documents). Work on the podium was finally completed in February 1963. The forced early start led to significant later problems, not least of which was that the podium columns were not strong enough to support the roof structure, and had to be re-built.[33]\n\n\n\n##### Stage II: Roof[edit]\n\n\n* ![Podium structure complete, 1962](image)\n\nPodium structure complete, 1962\n* ![Shells structure, c. 1965](image)\n\nShells structure, c. 1965\n* ![c. 1965](image)\n\nc. 1965\n* ![Tiles complete, c. 1968](image)\n\nTiles complete, c. 1968\n\n\nThe shells of the competition entry were originally of undefined geometry,[34] but, early in the design process, the \"shells\" were perceived as a series of parabolas supported by precast concrete ribs. However, engineers Ove Arup and Partners were unable to find an acceptable solution to constructing them. The formwork for using *in-situ* concrete would have been prohibitively expensive, and, because there was no repetition in any of the roof forms, the construction of precast concrete for each individual section would possibly have been even more expensive.\n\n\n\n![](image)Sydney Opera House shell ribs\n![](image)The glazed ceramic tiles of the Sydney Opera House\nFrom 1957 to 1963, the design team went through at least 12 iterations of the form of the shells trying to find an economically acceptable form (including schemes with parabolas, circular ribs and ellipsoids) before a workable solution was completed. The design work on the shells involved one of the earliest uses of computers in structural analysis, to understand the complex forces to which the shells would be subjected.[35][36] The computer system was also used in the assembly of the arches. The pins in the arches were surveyed at the end of each day, and the information was entered into the computer so the next arch could be properly placed the following day. In mid-1961, the design team found a solution to the problem: the shells all being created as sections from a sphere. This solution allows arches of varying length to be cast in a common mould, and a number of arch segments of common length to be placed adjacent to one another, to form a spherical section. With whom exactly this solution originated has been the subject of some controversy. It was originally credited to Utzon. Ove Arup's letter to Ashworth, a member of the Sydney Opera House Executive Committee, states: \"Utzon came up with an idea of making all the shells of uniform curvature throughout in both directions.\"[37] Peter Jones, the author of Ove Arup's biography, states that \"the architect and his supporters alike claimed to recall the precise *eureka* moment ...; the engineers and some of their associates, with equal conviction, recall discussion in both central London and at Ove's house.\"\n\n\nHe goes on to claim that \"the existing evidence shows that Arup's canvassed several possibilities for the geometry of the shells, from parabolas to ellipsoids and spheres.\"[35] Yuzo Mikami, a member of the design team, presents an opposite view in his book on the project, *Utzon's Sphere*.[38][39] It is unlikely that the truth will ever be categorically known, but there is a clear consensus that the design team worked very well indeed for the first part of the project and that Utzon, Arup, and Ronald Jenkins (partner of Ove Arup and Partners responsible for the Opera House project) all played a very significant part in the design development.[40]\n\n\nAs Peter Murray states in *The Saga of the Sydney Opera House*:[33]\n\n\n\n\n> ... the two men—and their teams—enjoyed a collaboration that was remarkable in its fruitfulness and, despite many traumas, was seen by most of those involved in the project as a high point of architect/engineer collaboration.\n> \n> \n\n\nThe design of the roof was tested on scale models in wind tunnels at University of Southampton and later NPL in order to establish the wind-pressure distribution around the roof shape in very high winds, which helped in the design of the roof tiles and their fixtures.[41][42]\n\n\n\n![](image)The shells of the Opera House at night, viewed from the south\nThe immensely complex design and construction of the shells was completed by Hornibrook Group Pty Ltd,[43] who were also responsible for construction in Stage III.[44] Hornibrook manufactured the 2400 precast ribs and 4000 roof panels in an on-site factory and also developed the construction processes.[33] The achievement of this solution avoided the need for expensive formwork construction by allowing the use of precast units and it also allowed the roof tiles to be prefabricated in sheets on the ground, instead of being stuck on individually at height.\n\n\nThe tiles themselves were manufactured by the Swedish company Höganäs Keramik. It took three years of development to produce the effect Utzon wanted in what became known as the Sydney Tile, 120mm square. It is made from clay with a small percentage of crushed stone.[45]\n\n\nOve Arup and Partners' site engineer supervised the construction of the shells, which used an innovative adjustable steel-trussed \"erection arch\" (developed by Hornibrook's engineer Joe Bertony) to support the different roofs before completion.[36] On 6 April 1962, it was estimated that the Opera House would be completed between August 1964 and March 1965.\n\n\n\n##### Stage III: Interiors[edit]\n\n\n* ![The Concert Hall and organ](image)\n\nThe Concert Hall and organ\n* ![View from the stage of the Concert Hall](image)\n\nView from the stage of the Concert Hall\n* ![View from the stage of the Joan Sutherland Theatre](image)\n\nView from the stage of the Joan Sutherland Theatre\n* ![Interior of the Studio Theatre](image)\n\nInterior of the Studio Theatre\n\n\nStage III, the interiors, started with Utzon moving his entire office to Sydney in February 1963. However, there was a change of government in 1965, and the new Robert Askin government declared the project under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Public Works. Due to the Ministry's criticism of the project's costs and time,[46] along with their impression of Utzon's designs being impractical, this ultimately led to his resignation in 1966 (see below).\n\n\nThe cost of the project so far, even in October 1966, was still only A$22.9 million,[47] less than a quarter of the final $102 million cost. However, the projected costs for the design were at this stage much more significant.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Concert Hall prior to renovations in 2020\nThe second stage of construction was progressing toward completion when Utzon resigned. His position was principally taken over by Peter Hall, who became largely responsible for the interior design. Other persons appointed that same year to replace Utzon were E. H. Farmer as government architect, D. S. Littlemore and Lionel Todd.\n\n\nFollowing Utzon's resignation, the acoustic advisor, Lothar Cremer, confirmed to the Sydney Opera House Executive Committee (SOHEC) that Utzon's original acoustic design allowed for only 2,000 seats in the main hall and further stated that increasing the number of seats to 3,000 as specified in the brief would be disastrous for the acoustics. According to Peter Jones, the stage designer, Martin Carr, criticised the \"shape, height and width of the stage, the physical facilities for artists, the location of the dressing rooms, the widths of doors and lifts, and the location of lighting switchboards.\"[48]\n\n\n\n#### Significant changes to Utzon's design[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The foyer of the Joan Sutherland Theatre, showing the internal structure and steel framing of the glass curtain walls; the final constructions were modified from Utzon's original designs\n![](image)The foyer of the Concert Hall\n* The major hall, which was originally to be a multipurpose opera/concert hall, became solely a concert hall, called the Concert Hall. The minor hall, originally for stage productions only, incorporated opera and ballet functions and was called the Opera Theatre, later renamed the Joan Sutherland Theatre. As a result, the Joan Sutherland Theatre is inadequate to stage large-scale opera and ballet. A theatre, a cinema and a library were also added. These were later changed to two live drama theatres and a smaller theatre \"in the round\". These now comprise the Drama Theatre, the Playhouse and the Studio respectively. These changes were primarily because of inadequacies in the original competition brief, which did not make it adequately clear how the Opera House was to be used. The layout of the interiors was changed, and the stage machinery, already designed and fitted inside the major hall, was pulled out and largely thrown away, as detailed in the 1968 BBC TV documentary *Autopsy on a Dream*, which \"chronicles the full spectrum of controversy surrounding the construction of the Sydney Opera House\".[49]\n* Externally, the cladding to the podium and the paving (the podium was originally not to be clad down to the water, but to be left open).\n* The construction of the glass walls (Utzon was planning to use a system of prefabricated plywood mullions, but a different system was designed to deal with the glass).\n* Utzon's plywood corridor designs, and his acoustic and seating designs for the interior of both major halls, were scrapped completely. His design for the Concert Hall was rejected as it only seated 2000, which was considered insufficient.[35] Utzon employed the acoustic consultant Lothar Cremer, and his designs for the major halls were later modelled and found to be very good. The subsequent Todd, Hall and Littlemore versions of both major halls have some problems with acoustics, particularly for the performing musicians. The orchestra pit in the Joan Sutherland Theatre is cramped and dangerous to musicians' hearing.[50] The Concert Hall has a very high roof, leading to a lack of early reflections onstage—perspex rings (the \"acoustic clouds\") hanging over the stage were added shortly before opening in an (unsuccessful) attempt to address this problem.\n\n\n#### Completion and cost[edit]\n\n\nThe Opera House was formally completed in 1973, having cost $102 million.[51] H.R. \"Sam\" Hoare, the Hornibrook director in charge of the project, provided the following approximations in 1973:\nStage I: podium Civil & Civic Pty Ltd approximately $5.5m.\nStage II: roof shells M.R. Hornibrook (NSW) Pty Ltd approximately $12.5m.\nStage III: completion The Hornibrook Group $56.5m.\nSeparate contracts: stage equipment, stage lighting and organ $9.0m. Fees and other costs: $16.5m.\n\n\nThe original cost and scheduling estimates in 1957 projected a cost of £3,500,000 ($7 million) and completion date of 26 January 1963 (Australia Day).[35] In reality, the project was completed ten years late and 1,357% over budget in real terms.\n\n\n\n#### Strike and Workers' Control[edit]\n\n\nIn 1972, a construction worker was fired, leading the BLF affiliated workers to demand his rehiring and a 25% wage increase. In response to this, all the workers were fired, and in revenge the workers broke into the construction site with a crowbar and brought their own toolboxes. Workers' control was applied to the site for five weeks as the construction workers worked 35 hours a week with improved morale, more efficient organization and fewer people skipping work. The workers agreed to end their work-in when management agreed to give them a 25% wage increase, the right to elect their foremen, four weeks annual leave and a large payment for their troubles.[52][53]\n\n\n\n### Utzon and his resignation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The building illuminated at night\nBefore the Sydney Opera House competition, Jørn Utzon had won seven of the 18 competitions he had entered but had never seen any of his designs built.[54] Utzon's submitted concept for the Sydney Opera House was almost universally admired and considered groundbreaking. The Assessors Report of January 1957 stated:\n\n\n\n\n> The drawings submitted for this scheme are simple to the point of being diagrammatic. Nevertheless, as we have returned again and again to the study of these drawings, we are convinced that they present a concept of an Opera House which is capable of becoming one of the great buildings of the world.\n> \n> \n\n\nFor the first stage, Utzon worked successfully with the rest of the design team and the client, but, as the project progressed, the Cahill government insisted on progressive revisions. They also did not fully appreciate the costs or work involved in design and construction. Tensions between the client and the design team grew further when an early start to construction was demanded despite an incomplete design. This resulted in a continuing series of delays and setbacks while various technical engineering issues were being refined. The building was unique, and the problems with the design issues and cost increases were exacerbated by commencement of work before the completion of the final plans.\n\n\nAfter the 1965 election of the Liberal Party, with Robert Askin becoming Premier of New South Wales, the relationship of client, architect, engineers and contractors became increasingly tense. Askin had been a \"vocal critic of the project prior to gaining office.\"[55] His new Minister for Public Works, Davis Hughes, was even less sympathetic. Elizabeth Farrelly, an Australian architecture critic, wrote that:\n\n\n\n\n> at an election night dinner party in Mosman, Hughes' daughter Sue Burgoyne boasted that her father would soon sack Utzon. Hughes had no interest in art, architecture or aesthetics. A fraud, as well as a philistine, he had been exposed before Parliament and dumped as Country Party leader for 19 years of falsely claiming a university degree. The Opera House gave Hughes a second chance. For him, as for Utzon, it was all about control; about the triumph of homegrown mediocrity over foreign genius.[55]\n> \n> \n\n\n![](image)The Opera House seen from the north\nDifferences ensued. One of the first was that Utzon believed the clients should receive information on all aspects of the design and construction through his practice, while the clients wanted a system (notably drawn in sketch form by Davis Hughes) where architect, contractors, and engineers each reported to the client directly and separately. This had great implications for procurement methods and cost control, with Utzon wishing to negotiate contracts with chosen suppliers (such as Ralph Symonds for the plywood interiors) and the New South Wales government insisting contracts be put out to tender.[33]\n\n\nUtzon was highly reluctant to respond to questions or criticism from the client's Sydney Opera House Executive Committee (SOHEC).[56] However, he was greatly supported throughout by a member of the committee and one of the original competition judges, Harry Ingham Ashworth. Utzon was unwilling to compromise on some aspects of his designs that the clients wanted to change.\n\n\nUtzon's ability was never in doubt, despite questions raised by Davis Hughes, who attempted to portray Utzon as an impractical dreamer. Ove Arup actually stated that Utzon was \"probably the best of any I have come across in my long experience of working with architects\"[57] and: \"The Opera House could become the world's foremost contemporary masterpiece if Utzon is given his head.\"\n\n\n\n![](image)The Opera House, backed by the Sydney Harbour Bridge, from the eastern Botanic Gardens\nIn October 1965, Utzon gave Hughes a schedule setting out the completion dates of parts of his work for stage III.[*citation needed*] Utzon was at this time working closely with Ralph Symonds, a manufacturer of plywood based in Sydney and highly regarded by many, despite an Arup engineer warning that Ralph Symonds's \"knowledge of the design stresses of plywood was extremely sketchy\" and that the technical advice was \"elementary to say the least and completely useless for our purposes.\" Australian architecture critic Elizabeth Farrelly has referred to Ove Arup's project engineer Michael Lewis as having \"other agendas\".[55] In any case, Hughes shortly after withheld permission for the construction of plywood prototypes for the interiors,[*citation needed*] and the relationship between Utzon and the client never recovered. By February 1966, Utzon was owed more than $100,000 in fees.[58] Hughes then withheld funding so that Utzon could not even pay his own staff. The government minutes record that following several threats of resignation, Utzon finally stated to Davis Hughes: \"If you don't do it, I resign.\" Hughes replied: \"I accept your resignation. Thank you very much. Goodbye.\"[59]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Opera House viewed from the south\nUtzon left the project on 28 February 1966. He said that Hughes's refusal to pay him any fees and the lack of collaboration caused his resignation and later described the situation as \"Malice in Blunderland\". In March 1966, Hughes offered him a subordinate role as \"design architect\" under a panel of executive architects, without any supervisory powers over the House's construction, but Utzon rejected this. Utzon left the country never to return.\n\n\nFollowing the resignation, there was great controversy about who was in the right and who was in the wrong. *The Sydney Morning Herald* initially opined: \"No architect in the world has enjoyed greater freedom than Mr Utzon. Few clients have been more patient or more generous than the people and the Government of NSW. One would not like history to record that this partnership was brought to an end by a fit of temper on the one side or by a fit of meanness on the other.\" On 17 March 1966, the *Herald* offered the view that:[60] \"It was not his [Utzon's] fault that a succession of Governments and the Opera House Trust should so signally have failed to impose any control or order on the project ... his concept was so daring that he himself could solve its problems only step by step ... his insistence on perfection led him to alter his design as he went along.\"\n\n\nThe Sydney Opera House opened the way for the immensely complex geometries of some modern architecture. The design was one of the first examples of the use of computer-aided design to design complex shapes. The design techniques developed by Utzon and Arup for the Sydney Opera House have been further developed and are now used for architecture, such as works of Gehry and blobitecture, as well as most reinforced concrete structures. The design is also one of the first in the world to use araldite to glue the precast structural elements together and proved the concept for future use.\n\n\nIt was also a first in mechanical engineering. Another Danish firm, Steensen Varming, was responsible for designing the new air-conditioning plant, the largest in Australia at the time, supplying over 600,000 cubic feet (17,000 m3) of air per minute,[61] using the innovative idea of harnessing the harbour water to create a water-cooled heat pump system that is still in operation today.[62]\n\n\n\n### Opening[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The steps of the Opera House\nThe Sydney Opera House was formally opened by Queen Elizabeth II, on 20 October 1973. A large crowd attended. The opening was televised and included fireworks and a performance of Beethoven's Symphony No. 9.[63]\n\n\n\n### Reconciliation with Utzon; building refurbishment[edit]\n\n\nIn the late 1990s, the Sydney Opera House Trust resumed communication with Utzon in an attempt to effect a reconciliation and to secure his involvement in future changes to the building. In 1999, he was appointed by the trust as a design consultant for future work.[64]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Utzon Room: rebuilt under Utzon in 2000 with his tapestry, *Homage to Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach*\nIn 2004, the first interior space rebuilt to an Utzon design was opened and renamed \"The Utzon Room\" in his honour. It contains an original Utzon tapestry (14.00 x 3.70 metres) called *Homage to Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach*.[65] In April 2007, he proposed a major reconstruction of the Opera Theatre, as it was then known.[66] Utzon died on 29 November 2008.[67]\n\n\nA state memorial service, attended by Utzon's son Jan and daughter Lin, was held in the Concert Hall on 25 March 2009 featuring performances, readings and recollections from prominent figures in the Australian performing arts scene.\n\n\nRefurbished Western Foyer and accessibility improvements were commissioned on 17 November 2009, the largest building project completed since Utzon was re-engaged in 1999. Designed by Utzon and his son Jan, the project provided improved ticketing, toilet and cloaking facilities. New escalators and a public lift enabled enhanced access for the disabled and families with prams. The prominent paralympian athlete Louise Sauvage was announced as the building's \"accessibility ambassador\" to advise on further improvements to aid people with disabilities.[68]\n\n\nIn 2013, a 60 metre long artwork by artist Reg Mombassa was unveiled at the Sydney Opera House. The Gumscape, Road and Creatures triptych was commissioned by the Sydney Opera House to cover the scaffolding concealing refurbishment building work.[69]\n\n\nOn 29 March 2016, an original 1959 tapestry by Le Corbusier (2.18 x 3.55 metres), commissioned by Utzon to be hung in the Sydney Opera House and called *Les Dés Sont Jetés* (The Dice Are Cast), was finally unveiled *in situ* after being owned by the Utzon family and held at their home in Denmark for over 50 years. The tapestry was bought at auction by the Sydney Opera House in June 2015. It now hangs in the building's Western Foyer and is accessible to the public.[70]\n\n\nIn the second half of 2017, the Joan Sutherland Theatre was closed to replace the stage machinery and for other works.\n\n\n\n## Architectural design role of Peter Hall[edit]\n\n\nAfter the resignation of Utzon, the Minister for Public Works, Davis Hughes, and the Government Architect, Ted Farmer, organised a team to bring the Sydney Opera House to completion. The architectural work was divided between three appointees who became the Hall, Todd, Littlemore partnership. David Littlemore would manage construction supervision, Lionel Todd contract documentation, while the crucial role of design became the responsibility of Peter Hall.[71]: 45\n\n\nHall completed a combined arts and architecture degree at Sydney University. Upon graduation a travel scholarship enabled him to spend twelve months in Europe during which time he visited Utzon in Hellebæk.[72] Returning to Sydney, Hall worked for the Government Architect, a branch of the NSW Public Works Department. While there he established himself as a talented design architect with a number of court and university buildings, including the Goldstein Hall at the University of New South Wales, which won the Sir John Sulman Medal in 1964.\n\n\nHall resigned from the Government Architects office in early 1966 to pursue his own practice. When approached to take on the design role, (after at least two prominent Sydney architects had declined), Hall spoke with Utzon by phone before accepting the position. Utzon reportedly told Hall: he (Hall) would not be able to finish the job and the Government would have to invite him back.[71]: 46 Hall also sought the advice of others, including architect Don Gazzard who warned him acceptance would be a bad career move as the project would \"never be his own\".[71]: 47[73]\n\n\nHall agreed to accept the role on the condition there was no possibility of Utzon returning. Even so, his appointment did not go down well with many of his fellow architects who considered that no one but Utzon should complete the Sydney Opera House.[72] Upon Utzon's dismissal, a rally of protest had marched to Bennelong Point. A petition was also circulated, including in the Government Architects office. Peter Hall was one of the many who had signed the petition that called for Utzon's reinstatement.[72]\n\n\nWhen Hall agreed to the design role and was appointed in April 1966, he imagined he would find the design and documentation for the Stage III well advanced. What he found was an enormous amount of work ahead of him with many aspects completely unresolved by Utzon in relation to seating capacity, acoustics and structure.[71]: 42 In addition Hall found the project had proceeded for nine years without the development of a concise client brief. To bring himself up to speed, Hall investigated concert and opera venues overseas and engaged stage consultant Ben Schlange and acoustic consultant Wilhelm Jordan, while establishing his team. In consultation with all the potential building users, the first Review of Program was completed in January 1967. The most significant conclusion reached by Hall was that concert and opera were incompatible in the same hall.[71]: 53 Although Utzon had sketched ideas using plywood for the great enclosing glass walls, their structural viability was unresolved when Hall took on the design role.[71]: 49 With the ability to delegate tasks and effectively coordinate the work of consultants, Hall guided the project for over five years until the opening day in 1973.\n\n\nA former Government Architect, Peter Webber, in his book *Peter Hall: the Phantom of the Opera House*, concludes: when Utzon resigned no one was better qualified (than Hall) to rise to the challenge of completing the design of the Opera House.[71]: 126\n\n\n\n## Performance firsts[edit]\n\n\nDuring the construction phase, lunchtime performances were often arranged for the workers, with American vocalist Paul Robeson the first artist to perform, in 1960.\n\n\nVarious performances were presented prior to the official opening:\n\n\n\n* The first solo piano recital was in the Concert Hall on 10 April 1973, played by Romola Costantino to an invited audience.[74]\n* The first performance of an opera was Larry Sitsky's *The Fall of the House of Usher* (1965), to a libretto by Mary Durack, [75] in a double-bill with *Dalgerie* by James Penberthy, conducted by Rex Hobcroft; it took place on 25 July 1973.[76]\n* The first opera to be performed in what was then known as the Opera Theatre was Sergei Prokofiev's *War and Peace*, on 28 September 1973, conducted by the Australian Opera's Music Director, Edward Downes. (It had been intended that Peter Sculthorpe's work *Rites of Passage* would have this honour, but it was not ready on time. *Rites of Passage* was premiered almost exactly a year later, on 27 September 1974.)[*citation needed*]\n* The first public concert in the Concert Hall took place on 29 September 1973. It was an all-Wagner orchestral concert performed by the Sydney Symphony Orchestra,[77] conducted by Charles Mackerras and with Birgit Nilsson as the soprano soloist. The first music played was the Prelude to *Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg*. The concert closed with the Immolation Scene from *Götterdämmerung*.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAfter the opening:\n\n\n\n* The first violin and piano recital was given by Wanda Wiłkomirska, with pianist Geoffrey Parsons.[78]\n\n\n## Public and commemorative events[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Sydney Opera House during Vivid Sydney (2019)\nIn 1993, Constantine Koukias was commissioned by the Sydney Opera House Trust in association with REM Theatre to compose *Icon*, a large-scale music theatre piece for the 20th anniversary of the Sydney Opera House.[79]\n\n\nDuring the 2000 Summer Olympics, the venue served as the focal point for the triathlon events. The event had a 1.5 km (0.9 mi) swimming loop at Farm Cove, along with competitions in the neighbouring Royal Botanical Gardens for the cycling and running portions of the event.[80]\n\n\nSince 2013, a group of residents from the nearby Bennelong Apartments (better known as 'The Toaster'), calling themselves the Sydney Opera House Concerned Citizens Group, have been campaigning against Forecourt Concerts on the grounds that they exceed noise levels outlined in the development approval (DA). In February 2017 the NSW Department of Planning and the Environment handed down a $15,000 fine to the Sydney Opera House for breach of allowed noise levels at a concert held in November 2015. However, the DA was amended in 2016 to allow an increase in noise levels in the forecourt by 5 decibels. The residents opposing the concerts contend that a new DA should have been filed rather than an amendment.[81][82]\n\n\nThe Sydney Opera House sails formed a graphic projection-screen in a lightshow mounted in connection with the International Fleet Review in Sydney Harbour on 5 October 2013.[83]\n\n\nOn 31 December 2013, the venue's 40th anniversary year, a New Year fireworks display was mounted for the first time in a decade.[84] The Sydney Opera House hosted an event, 'the biggest blind date' on Friday 21 February 2014 that won an historic Guinness World Record.[85] The longest continuous serving employee was commemorated on 27 June 2018, for 50 years of service.[86]\n\n\nOn 14 June 2019, a state memorial service for former Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke was held at the Sydney Opera House.\n\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\nThe Opera House chief executive Louise Herron clashed with Sydney radio commentator Alan Jones on 5 October 2018. Jones called for her sacking for refusing to allow Racing NSW to use the Opera House sails to advertise The Everest horse race.[87][88] Within hours, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian overruled Herron. Two days later, Prime Minister Scott Morrison supported the decision, calling the Opera House \"the biggest billboard Sydney has\".[89] The NSW Labor Party leader, Luke Foley, and senior federal Labor frontbencher Anthony Albanese had supported the proposal.[90] The political view was not supported by significant public opinion, with a petition against the advertising collecting over 298,000 names by 9 October 2018.[91] 235,000 printed petition documents were presented to the NSW Parliament in the morning.[92] A survey conducted on 8 October by market research firm Micromex found that 81% of those surveyed were not supportive of the premier's direction.[93]\n\n\n\n### Coronation controversy[edit]\n\n\nIn 2023, the New South Wales Government scrapped plans to light the sails of the Sydney Opera House in honor of the coronation of King Charles.\n\n\nState Premier Chris Minns argued that the sails had been lit up too often and was costing significant taxpayer money, stating that the cost was somewhere between 80 and 100 thousand dollars.[94]\n\n\n\n## Notable performances[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

Located on the foreshore of Sydney Harbour, it is widely regarded as one of the world's most famous and distinctive buildings and a masterpiece of 20th-century architecture.[3][4]\n\n\nDesigned by Danish architect Jørn Utzon, but completed by an Australian architectural team headed by Peter Hall, the building was formally opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 20 October 1973,[5] 16 years after Utzon's 1957 selection as winner of an international design competition. The Government of New South Wales, led by the premier, Joseph Cahill, authorised work to begin in 1958 with Utzon directing construction. The government's decision to build Utzon's design is often overshadowed by circumstances that followed, including cost and scheduling overruns as well as the architect's ultimate resignation.[6]\n\n\nThe building and its surrounds occupy the whole of Bennelong Point on Sydney Harbour, between Sydney Cove and Farm Cove, adjacent to the Sydney central business district and the Royal Botanic Gardens, and near to the Sydney Harbour Bridge.\n\n\nThe building comprises multiple performance venues, which together host well over 1,500 performances annually, attended by more than 1.2 million people.[7] Performances are presented by numerous performing artists, including three resident companies: Opera Australia, the Sydney Theatre Company and the Sydney Symphony Orchestra. As one of the most popular visitor attractions in Australia, the site is visited by more than eight million people annually, and approximately 350,000 visitors take a guided tour of the building each year.[8] The building is managed by the Sydney Opera House Trust, an agency of the New South Wales State Government.\n\n\nOn 28 June 2007, the Sydney Opera House became a UNESCO World Heritage Site,[9] having been listed on the (now defunct) Register of the National Estate since 1980, the National Trust of Australia register since 1983, the City of Sydney Heritage Inventory since 2000, the New South Wales State Heritage Register since 2003, and the Australian National Heritage List since 2005.[10][11] The Opera House was also a finalist in the *New7Wonders of the World* campaign list.[12][13]\n\n\n\n\n## Description[edit]\n\n\nThe facility features a modern expressionist design, with a series of large precast concrete \"shells\",[14] each composed of sections of a sphere of 75.2 metres (246 ft 8.6 in) radius,[15] forming the roofs of the structure, set on a monumental podium. The building covers 1.8 hectares (4.4 acres) of land and is 183 m (600 ft) long and 120 m (394 ft) wide at its widest point. It is supported on 588 concrete piers sunk as much as 25 m (82 ft) below sea level. The highest roof point is 67 metres above sea-level which is the same height as that of a 22-storey building. The roof is made of 2,194 pre-cast concrete sections, which weigh up to 15 tonnes each.[16]\n\n\nAlthough the roof structures are commonly referred to as \"shells\" (as in this article), they are precast concrete panels supported by precast concrete ribs, not shells in a strictly structural sense.[17] Though the shells appear uniformly white from a distance, they actually feature a subtle chevron pattern composed of 1,056,006 tiles in two colours: glossy white and matte cream. The tiles were manufactured by the Swedish company Höganäs AB which generally produced stoneware tiles for the paper-mill industry.[18]\n\n\nApart from the tile of the shells and the glass curtain walls of the foyer spaces, the building's exterior is largely clad with aggregate panels composed of pink granite quarried at Tarana. Significant interior surface treatments also include off-form concrete, Australian white birch plywood supplied from Wauchope in northern New South Wales, and brush box glulam.[19]\n\n\nOf the two larger spaces, the Concert Hall is in the western group of shells, the Joan Sutherland Theatre in the eastern group. The scale of the shells was chosen to reflect the internal height requirements, with low entrance spaces, rising over the seating areas up to the high stage towers. The smaller venues (the Drama Theatre, the Playhouse and the Studio) are within the podium, beneath the Concert Hall. A smaller group of shells set to the western side of the Monumental Steps houses the Bennelong Restaurant. The podium is surrounded by substantial open public spaces, and the large stone-paved forecourt area with the adjacent monumental steps is regularly used as a performance space.\n\n\n\n### Performance venues and facilities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The main Concert Hall\n![](image)Joan Sutherland Theatre interior\n![](image)The Bennelong Restaurant, located at the southernmost sailThe Sydney Opera House includes a number of performance venues:[20]\n\n\n* **Concert Hall**: With 2,679 seats, the home of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra and used by a large number of other concert presenters. It contains the Sydney Opera House Grand Organ, the largest mechanical tracker action organ in the world, with over 10,000 pipes.[21]\n* **Joan Sutherland Theatre**: A proscenium theatre with 1,507 seats,[22] the Sydney home of Opera Australia and The Australian Ballet. Until 17 October 2012 it was known as the Opera Theatre.[23][24]\n* **Drama Theatre**: A proscenium theatre with 544 seats, used by the Sydney Theatre Company and other dance and theatrical presenters.\n* **Playhouse**: A non-proscenium end-stage theatre with 398 seats.\n* **Studio**: A flexible space with 280 permanent seats (some of which can be folded up) and a maximum capacity of 400, depending on configuration.\n* **Utzon Room**: A small multi-purpose venue for parties, corporate functions and small productions (such as chamber music performances).\n* **Recording Studio**\n* **Outdoor Forecourt**: A flexible open-air venue with a wide range of configuration options, including the possibility of utilising the Monumental Steps as audience seating, used for a range of community events and major outdoor performances.\n\n\nOther areas (for example the northern and western foyers) are also used for performances on an occasional basis. Venues are also used for conferences, ceremonies and social functions.\n\n\n\n### Other facilities[edit]\n\n\nThe building also houses a recording studio, retail shops, cafes, restaurants, bars including the Opera Bar and Opera Kitchen. Guided tours are available, including a frequent tour of the front-of-house spaces, and a daily backstage tour that takes visitors backstage to see areas normally reserved for performers and crew members.\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Construction history[edit]\n\n\n#### Origins[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bennelong Point with tram depot in the 1920s (top left-hand side of photograph), during the building of Sydney Harbour Bridge (foreground)\nPlanning began in the late 1940s when Eugene Goossens, the Director of the New South Wales State Conservatorium of Music, lobbied for a suitable venue for large theatrical productions. The normal venue for such productions, the Sydney Town Hall, was not considered large enough. By 1954, Goossens succeeded in gaining the support of New South Wales Premier Joseph Cahill, who called for designs for a dedicated opera house. It was also Goossens who insisted that Bennelong Point be the site: Cahill had wanted it to be on or near Wynyard Railway Station in the northwest of the central business district.[25]\n\n\nAn international design competition was launched by Cahill on 13 September 1955 and received 233 entries, representing architects from 32 countries. The criteria specified a large hall seating 3,000 and a small hall for 1,200 people, each to be designed for different uses, including full-scale operas, orchestral and choral concerts, mass meetings, lectures, ballet performances, and other presentations.[26]\n\n\n\n![](image)Utzon's initial sketches in 1957\nThe winner, announced in 1957, was Danish architect Jørn Utzon. Utzon's design was selected by Finnish-American architect Eero Saarinen from a final cut of 30 rejects.[27] The runner-up was a Philadelphia-based team assembled by Robert Geddes and George Qualls, both teaching at the University of Pennsylvania School of Design. They brought together a band of Penn faculty and friends from Philadelphia architectural offices, including Melvin Brecher, Warren Cunningham, Joseph Marzella, Walter Wiseman, and Leon Loschetter. Geddes, Brecher, Qualls, and Cunningham went on to found the firm GBQC Architects. The grand prize was 5,000 Australian pounds.[28] Utzon visited Sydney in 1957 to help supervise the project.[29] His office moved to Palm Beach, Sydney in February 1963.[30]\n\n\nUtzon received the Pritzker Architecture Prize, architecture's highest honour, in 2003.[31] The Pritzker Prize citation read:\n\n\n\n\n> There is no doubt that the Sydney Opera House is his masterpiece. It is one of the great iconic buildings of the 20th century, an image of great beauty that has become known throughout the world – a symbol for not only a city but a whole country and continent.\n> \n> \n\n\n#### Design and construction[edit]\n\n\nThe Fort Macquarie Tram Depot, occupying the site at the time of these plans, was demolished in 1958 and construction began in March 1959. It was built in four stages: stage I (1957–1959) was planning out the building; stage II (1959–1963) consisted of building the upper podium; stage III (1963–1967) the construction of the outer shells; stage IV (1967–1973) interior design and construction.\n\n\n\n#### Stage I: Podium[edit]\n\n\nStage I commenced on 2 March 1959 with the construction firm Civil & Civic, monitored by the engineers Ove Arup and Partners.[32] The government had pushed for work to begin early, fearing that funding, or public opinion, might turn against them. However, Utzon had still not completed the final designs. Major structural issues still remained unresolved. By 23 January 1961, work was running 47 weeks behind,[32] mainly because of unexpected difficulties (inclement weather, unexpected difficulty diverting stormwater, construction beginning before proper construction drawings had been prepared, changes of original contract documents). Work on the podium was finally completed in February 1963. The forced early start led to significant later problems, not least of which was that the podium columns were not strong enough to support the roof structure, and had to be re-built.[33]\n\n\n\n##### Stage II: Roof[edit]\n\n\n* ![Podium structure complete, 1962](image)\n\nPodium structure complete, 1962\n* ![Shells structure, c. 1965](image)\n\nShells structure, c. 1965\n* ![c. 1965](image)\n\nc. 1965\n* ![Tiles complete, c. 1968](image)\n\nTiles complete, c. 1968\n\n\nThe shells of the competition entry were originally of undefined geometry,[34] but, early in the design process, the \"shells\" were perceived as a series of parabolas supported by precast concrete ribs. However, engineers Ove Arup and Partners were unable to find an acceptable solution to constructing them. The formwork for using *in-situ* concrete would have been prohibitively expensive, and, because there was no repetition in any of the roof forms, the construction of precast concrete for each individual section would possibly have been even more expensive.\n\n\n\n![](image)Sydney Opera House shell ribs\n![](image)The glazed ceramic tiles of the Sydney Opera House\nFrom 1957 to 1963, the design team went through at least 12 iterations of the form of the shells trying to find an economically acceptable form (including schemes with parabolas, circular ribs and ellipsoids) before a workable solution was completed. The design work on the shells involved one of the earliest uses of computers in structural analysis, to understand the complex forces to which the shells would be subjected.[35][36] The computer system was also used in the assembly of the arches. The pins in the arches were surveyed at the end of each day, and the information was entered into the computer so the next arch could be properly placed the following day. In mid-1961, the design team found a solution to the problem: the shells all being created as sections from a sphere. This solution allows arches of varying length to be cast in a common mould, and a number of arch segments of common length to be placed adjacent to one another, to form a spherical section. With whom exactly this solution originated has been the subject of some controversy. It was originally credited to Utzon. Ove Arup's letter to Ashworth, a member of the Sydney Opera House Executive Committee, states: \"Utzon came up with an idea of making all the shells of uniform curvature throughout in both directions.\"[37] Peter Jones, the author of Ove Arup's biography, states that \"the architect and his supporters alike claimed to recall the precise *eureka* moment ...; the engineers and some of their associates, with equal conviction, recall discussion in both central London and at Ove's house.\"\n\n\nHe goes on to claim that \"the existing evidence shows that Arup's canvassed several possibilities for the geometry of the shells, from parabolas to ellipsoids and spheres.\"[35] Yuzo Mikami, a member of the design team, presents an opposite view in his book on the project, *Utzon's Sphere*.[38][39] It is unlikely that the truth will ever be categorically known, but there is a clear consensus that the design team worked very well indeed for the first part of the project and that Utzon, Arup, and Ronald Jenkins (partner of Ove Arup and Partners responsible for the Opera House project) all played a very significant part in the design development.[40]\n\n\nAs Peter Murray states in *The Saga of the Sydney Opera House*:[33]\n\n\n\n\n> ... the two men—and their teams—enjoyed a collaboration that was remarkable in its fruitfulness and, despite many traumas, was seen by most of those involved in the project as a high point of architect/engineer collaboration.\n> \n> \n\n\nThe design of the roof was tested on scale models in wind tunnels at University of Southampton and later NPL in order to establish the wind-pressure distribution around the roof shape in very high winds, which helped in the design of the roof tiles and their fixtures.[41][42]\n\n\n\n![](image)The shells of the Opera House at night, viewed from the south\nThe immensely complex design and construction of the shells was completed by Hornibrook Group Pty Ltd,[43] who were also responsible for construction in Stage III.[44] Hornibrook manufactured the 2400 precast ribs and 4000 roof panels in an on-site factory and also developed the construction processes.[33] The achievement of this solution avoided the need for expensive formwork construction by allowing the use of precast units and it also allowed the roof tiles to be prefabricated in sheets on the ground, instead of being stuck on individually at height.\n\n\nThe tiles themselves were manufactured by the Swedish company Höganäs Keramik. It took three years of development to produce the effect Utzon wanted in what became known as the Sydney Tile, 120mm square. It is made from clay with a small percentage of crushed stone.[45]\n\n\nOve Arup and Partners' site engineer supervised the construction of the shells, which used an innovative adjustable steel-trussed \"erection arch\" (developed by Hornibrook's engineer Joe Bertony) to support the different roofs before completion.[36] On 6 April 1962, it was estimated that the Opera House would be completed between August 1964 and March 1965.\n\n\n\n##### Stage III: Interiors[edit]\n\n\n* ![The Concert Hall and organ](image)\n\nThe Concert Hall and organ\n* ![View from the stage of the Concert Hall](image)\n\nView from the stage of the Concert Hall\n* ![View from the stage of the Joan Sutherland Theatre](image)\n\nView from the stage of the Joan Sutherland Theatre\n* ![Interior of the Studio Theatre](image)\n\nInterior of the Studio Theatre\n\n\nStage III, the interiors, started with Utzon moving his entire office to Sydney in February 1963. However, there was a change of government in 1965, and the new Robert Askin government declared the project under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Public Works. Due to the Ministry's criticism of the project's costs and time,[46] along with their impression of Utzon's designs being impractical, this ultimately led to his resignation in 1966 (see below).\n\n\nThe cost of the project so far, even in October 1966, was still only A$22.9 million,[47] less than a quarter of the final $102 million cost. However, the projected costs for the design were at this stage much more significant.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Concert Hall prior to renovations in 2020\nThe second stage of construction was progressing toward completion when Utzon resigned. His position was principally taken over by Peter Hall, who became largely responsible for the interior design. Other persons appointed that same year to replace Utzon were E. H. Farmer as government architect, D. S. Littlemore and Lionel Todd.\n\n\nFollowing Utzon's resignation, the acoustic advisor, Lothar Cremer, confirmed to the Sydney Opera House Executive Committee (SOHEC) that Utzon's original acoustic design allowed for only 2,000 seats in the main hall and further stated that increasing the number of seats to 3,000 as specified in the brief would be disastrous for the acoustics. According to Peter Jones, the stage designer, Martin Carr, criticised the \"shape, height and width of the stage, the physical facilities for artists, the location of the dressing rooms, the widths of doors and lifts, and the location of lighting switchboards.\"[48]\n\n\n\n#### Significant changes to Utzon's design[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The foyer of the Joan Sutherland Theatre, showing the internal structure and steel framing of the glass curtain walls; the final constructions were modified from Utzon's original designs\n![](image)The foyer of the Concert Hall\n* The major hall, which was originally to be a multipurpose opera/concert hall, became solely a concert hall, called the Concert Hall. The minor hall, originally for stage productions only, incorporated opera and ballet functions and was called the Opera Theatre, later renamed the Joan Sutherland Theatre. As a result, the Joan Sutherland Theatre is inadequate to stage large-scale opera and ballet. A theatre, a cinema and a library were also added. These were later changed to two live drama theatres and a smaller theatre \"in the round\". These now comprise the Drama Theatre, the Playhouse and the Studio respectively. These changes were primarily because of inadequacies in the original competition brief, which did not make it adequately clear how the Opera House was to be used. The layout of the interiors was changed, and the stage machinery, already designed and fitted inside the major hall, was pulled out and largely thrown away, as detailed in the 1968 BBC TV documentary *Autopsy on a Dream*, which \"chronicles the full spectrum of controversy surrounding the construction of the Sydney Opera House\".[49]\n* Externally, the cladding to the podium and the paving (the podium was originally not to be clad down to the water, but to be left open).\n* The construction of the glass walls (Utzon was planning to use a system of prefabricated plywood mullions, but a different system was designed to deal with the glass).\n* Utzon's plywood corridor designs, and his acoustic and seating designs for the interior of both major halls, were scrapped completely. His design for the Concert Hall was rejected as it only seated 2000, which was considered insufficient.[35] Utzon employed the acoustic consultant Lothar Cremer, and his designs for the major halls were later modelled and found to be very good. The subsequent Todd, Hall and Littlemore versions of both major halls have some problems with acoustics, particularly for the performing musicians. The orchestra pit in the Joan Sutherland Theatre is cramped and dangerous to musicians' hearing.[50] The Concert Hall has a very high roof, leading to a lack of early reflections onstage—perspex rings (the \"acoustic clouds\") hanging over the stage were added shortly before opening in an (unsuccessful) attempt to address this problem.\n\n\n#### Completion and cost[edit]\n\n\nThe Opera House was formally completed in 1973, having cost $102 million.[51] H.R. \"Sam\" Hoare, the Hornibrook director in charge of the project, provided the following approximations in 1973:\nStage I: podium Civil & Civic Pty Ltd approximately $5.5m.\nStage II: roof shells M.R. Hornibrook (NSW) Pty Ltd approximately $12.5m.\nStage III: completion The Hornibrook Group $56.5m.\nSeparate contracts: stage equipment, stage lighting and organ $9.0m. Fees and other costs: $16.5m.\n\n\nThe original cost and scheduling estimates in 1957 projected a cost of £3,500,000 ($7 million) and completion date of 26 January 1963 (Australia Day).[35] In reality, the project was completed ten years late and 1,357% over budget in real terms.\n\n\n\n#### Strike and Workers' Control[edit]\n\n\nIn 1972, a construction worker was fired, leading the BLF affiliated workers to demand his rehiring and a 25% wage increase. In response to this, all the workers were fired, and in revenge the workers broke into the construction site with a crowbar and brought their own toolboxes. Workers' control was applied to the site for five weeks as the construction workers worked 35 hours a week with improved morale, more efficient organization and fewer people skipping work. The workers agreed to end their work-in when management agreed to give them a 25% wage increase, the right to elect their foremen, four weeks annual leave and a large payment for their troubles.[52][53]\n\n\n\n### Utzon and his resignation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The building illuminated at night\nBefore the Sydney Opera House competition, Jørn Utzon had won seven of the 18 competitions he had entered but had never seen any of his designs built.[54] Utzon's submitted concept for the Sydney Opera House was almost universally admired and considered groundbreaking. The Assessors Report of January 1957 stated:\n\n\n\n\n> The drawings submitted for this scheme are simple to the point of being diagrammatic. Nevertheless, as we have returned again and again to the study of these drawings, we are convinced that they present a concept of an Opera House which is capable of becoming one of the great buildings of the world.\n> \n> \n\n\nFor the first stage, Utzon worked successfully with the rest of the design team and the client, but, as the project progressed, the Cahill government insisted on progressive revisions. They also did not fully appreciate the costs or work involved in design and construction. Tensions between the client and the design team grew further when an early start to construction was demanded despite an incomplete design. This resulted in a continuing series of delays and setbacks while various technical engineering issues were being refined. The building was unique, and the problems with the design issues and cost increases were exacerbated by commencement of work before the completion of the final plans.\n\n\nAfter the 1965 election of the Liberal Party, with Robert Askin becoming Premier of New South Wales, the relationship of client, architect, engineers and contractors became increasingly tense. Askin had been a \"vocal critic of the project prior to gaining office.\"[55] His new Minister for Public Works, Davis Hughes, was even less sympathetic. Elizabeth Farrelly, an Australian architecture critic, wrote that:\n\n\n\n\n> at an election night dinner party in Mosman, Hughes' daughter Sue Burgoyne boasted that her father would soon sack Utzon. Hughes had no interest in art, architecture or aesthetics. A fraud, as well as a philistine, he had been exposed before Parliament and dumped as Country Party leader for 19 years of falsely claiming a university degree. The Opera House gave Hughes a second chance. For him, as for Utzon, it was all about control; about the triumph of homegrown mediocrity over foreign genius.[55]\n> \n> \n\n\n![](image)The Opera House seen from the north\nDifferences ensued. One of the first was that Utzon believed the clients should receive information on all aspects of the design and construction through his practice, while the clients wanted a system (notably drawn in sketch form by Davis Hughes) where architect, contractors, and engineers each reported to the client directly and separately. This had great implications for procurement methods and cost control, with Utzon wishing to negotiate contracts with chosen suppliers (such as Ralph Symonds for the plywood interiors) and the New South Wales government insisting contracts be put out to tender.[33]\n\n\nUtzon was highly reluctant to respond to questions or criticism from the client's Sydney Opera House Executive Committee (SOHEC).[56] However, he was greatly supported throughout by a member of the committee and one of the original competition judges, Harry Ingham Ashworth. Utzon was unwilling to compromise on some aspects of his designs that the clients wanted to change.\n\n\nUtzon's ability was never in doubt, despite questions raised by Davis Hughes, who attempted to portray Utzon as an impractical dreamer. Ove Arup actually stated that Utzon was \"probably the best of any I have come across in my long experience of working with architects\"[57] and: \"The Opera House could become the world's foremost contemporary masterpiece if Utzon is given his head.\"\n\n\n\n![](image)The Opera House, backed by the Sydney Harbour Bridge, from the eastern Botanic Gardens\nIn October 1965, Utzon gave Hughes a schedule setting out the completion dates of parts of his work for stage III.[*citation needed*] Utzon was at this time working closely with Ralph Symonds, a manufacturer of plywood based in Sydney and highly regarded by many, despite an Arup engineer warning that Ralph Symonds's \"knowledge of the design stresses of plywood was extremely sketchy\" and that the technical advice was \"elementary to say the least and completely useless for our purposes.\" Australian architecture critic Elizabeth Farrelly has referred to Ove Arup's project engineer Michael Lewis as having \"other agendas\".[55] In any case, Hughes shortly after withheld permission for the construction of plywood prototypes for the interiors,[*citation needed*] and the relationship between Utzon and the client never recovered. By February 1966, Utzon was owed more than $100,000 in fees.[58] Hughes then withheld funding so that Utzon could not even pay his own staff. The government minutes record that following several threats of resignation, Utzon finally stated to Davis Hughes: \"If you don't do it, I resign.\" Hughes replied: \"I accept your resignation. Thank you very much. Goodbye.\"[59]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Opera House viewed from the south\nUtzon left the project on 28 February 1966. He said that Hughes's refusal to pay him any fees and the lack of collaboration caused his resignation and later described the situation as \"Malice in Blunderland\". In March 1966, Hughes offered him a subordinate role as \"design architect\" under a panel of executive architects, without any supervisory powers over the House's construction, but Utzon rejected this. Utzon left the country never to return.\n\n\nFollowing the resignation, there was great controversy about who was in the right and who was in the wrong. *The Sydney Morning Herald* initially opined: \"No architect in the world has enjoyed greater freedom than Mr Utzon. Few clients have been more patient or more generous than the people and the Government of NSW. One would not like history to record that this partnership was brought to an end by a fit of temper on the one side or by a fit of meanness on the other.\" On 17 March 1966, the *Herald* offered the view that:[60] \"It was not his [Utzon's] fault that a succession of Governments and the Opera House Trust should so signally have failed to impose any control or order on the project ... his concept was so daring that he himself could solve its problems only step by step ... his insistence on perfection led him to alter his design as he went along.\"\n\n\nThe Sydney Opera House opened the way for the immensely complex geometries of some modern architecture. The design was one of the first examples of the use of computer-aided design to design complex shapes. The design techniques developed by Utzon and Arup for the Sydney Opera House have been further developed and are now used for architecture, such as works of Gehry and blobitecture, as well as most reinforced concrete structures. The design is also one of the first in the world to use araldite to glue the precast structural elements together and proved the concept for future use.\n\n\nIt was also a first in mechanical engineering. Another Danish firm, Steensen Varming, was responsible for designing the new air-conditioning plant, the largest in Australia at the time, supplying over 600,000 cubic feet (17,000 m3) of air per minute,[61] using the innovative idea of harnessing the harbour water to create a water-cooled heat pump system that is still in operation today.[62]\n\n\n\n### Opening[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The steps of the Opera House\nThe Sydney Opera House was formally opened by Queen Elizabeth II, on 20 October 1973. A large crowd attended. The opening was televised and included fireworks and a performance of Beethoven's Symphony No. 9.[63]\n\n\n\n### Reconciliation with Utzon; building refurbishment[edit]\n\n\nIn the late 1990s, the Sydney Opera House Trust resumed communication with Utzon in an attempt to effect a reconciliation and to secure his involvement in future changes to the building. In 1999, he was appointed by the trust as a design consultant for future work.[64]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Utzon Room: rebuilt under Utzon in 2000 with his tapestry, *Homage to Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach*\nIn 2004, the first interior space rebuilt to an Utzon design was opened and renamed \"The Utzon Room\" in his honour. It contains an original Utzon tapestry (14.00 x 3.70 metres) called *Homage to Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach*.[65] In April 2007, he proposed a major reconstruction of the Opera Theatre, as it was then known.[66] Utzon died on 29 November 2008.[67]\n\n\nA state memorial service, attended by Utzon's son Jan and daughter Lin, was held in the Concert Hall on 25 March 2009 featuring performances, readings and recollections from prominent figures in the Australian performing arts scene.\n\n\nRefurbished Western Foyer and accessibility improvements were commissioned on 17 November 2009, the largest building project completed since Utzon was re-engaged in 1999. Designed by Utzon and his son Jan, the project provided improved ticketing, toilet and cloaking facilities. New escalators and a public lift enabled enhanced access for the disabled and families with prams. The prominent paralympian athlete Louise Sauvage was announced as the building's \"accessibility ambassador\" to advise on further improvements to aid people with disabilities.[68]\n\n\nIn 2013, a 60 metre long artwork by artist Reg Mombassa was unveiled at the Sydney Opera House. The Gumscape, Road and Creatures triptych was commissioned by the Sydney Opera House to cover the scaffolding concealing refurbishment building work.[69]\n\n\nOn 29 March 2016, an original 1959 tapestry by Le Corbusier (2.18 x 3.55 metres), commissioned by Utzon to be hung in the Sydney Opera House and called *Les Dés Sont Jetés* (The Dice Are Cast), was finally unveiled *in situ* after being owned by the Utzon family and held at their home in Denmark for over 50 years. The tapestry was bought at auction by the Sydney Opera House in June 2015. It now hangs in the building's Western Foyer and is accessible to the public.[70]\n\n\nIn the second half of 2017, the Joan Sutherland Theatre was closed to replace the stage machinery and for other works.\n\n\n\n## Architectural design role of Peter Hall[edit]\n\n\nAfter the resignation of Utzon, the Minister for Public Works, Davis Hughes, and the Government Architect, Ted Farmer, organised a team to bring the Sydney Opera House to completion. The architectural work was divided between three appointees who became the Hall, Todd, Littlemore partnership. David Littlemore would manage construction supervision, Lionel Todd contract documentation, while the crucial role of design became the responsibility of Peter Hall.[71]: 45\n\n\nHall completed a combined arts and architecture degree at Sydney University. Upon graduation a travel scholarship enabled him to spend twelve months in Europe during which time he visited Utzon in Hellebæk.[72] Returning to Sydney, Hall worked for the Government Architect, a branch of the NSW Public Works Department. While there he established himself as a talented design architect with a number of court and university buildings, including the Goldstein Hall at the University of New South Wales, which won the Sir John Sulman Medal in 1964.\n\n\nHall resigned from the Government Architects office in early 1966 to pursue his own practice. When approached to take on the design role, (after at least two prominent Sydney architects had declined), Hall spoke with Utzon by phone before accepting the position. Utzon reportedly told Hall: he (Hall) would not be able to finish the job and the Government would have to invite him back.[71]: 46 Hall also sought the advice of others, including architect Don Gazzard who warned him acceptance would be a bad career move as the project would \"never be his own\".[71]: 47[73]\n\n\nHall agreed to accept the role on the condition there was no possibility of Utzon returning. Even so, his appointment did not go down well with many of his fellow architects who considered that no one but Utzon should complete the Sydney Opera House.[72] Upon Utzon's dismissal, a rally of protest had marched to Bennelong Point. A petition was also circulated, including in the Government Architects office. Peter Hall was one of the many who had signed the petition that called for Utzon's reinstatement.[72]\n\n\nWhen Hall agreed to the design role and was appointed in April 1966, he imagined he would find the design and documentation for the Stage III well advanced. What he found was an enormous amount of work ahead of him with many aspects completely unresolved by Utzon in relation to seating capacity, acoustics and structure.[71]: 42 In addition Hall found the project had proceeded for nine years without the development of a concise client brief. To bring himself up to speed, Hall investigated concert and opera venues overseas and engaged stage consultant Ben Schlange and acoustic consultant Wilhelm Jordan, while establishing his team. In consultation with all the potential building users, the first Review of Program was completed in January 1967. The most significant conclusion reached by Hall was that concert and opera were incompatible in the same hall.[71]: 53 Although Utzon had sketched ideas using plywood for the great enclosing glass walls, their structural viability was unresolved when Hall took on the design role.[71]: 49 With the ability to delegate tasks and effectively coordinate the work of consultants, Hall guided the project for over five years until the opening day in 1973.\n\n\nA former Government Architect, Peter Webber, in his book *Peter Hall: the Phantom of the Opera House*, concludes: when Utzon resigned no one was better qualified (than Hall) to rise to the challenge of completing the design of the Opera House.[71]: 126\n\n\n\n## Performance firsts[edit]\n\n\nDuring the construction phase, lunchtime performances were often arranged for the workers, with American vocalist Paul Robeson the first artist to perform, in 1960.\n\n\nVarious performances were presented prior to the official opening:\n\n\n\n* The first solo piano recital was in the Concert Hall on 10 April 1973, played by Romola Costantino to an invited audience.[74]\n* The first performance of an opera was Larry Sitsky's *The Fall of the House of Usher* (1965), to a libretto by Mary Durack, [75] in a double-bill with *Dalgerie* by James Penberthy, conducted by Rex Hobcroft; it took place on 25 July 1973.[76]\n* The first opera to be performed in what was then known as the Opera Theatre was Sergei Prokofiev's *War and Peace*, on 28 September 1973, conducted by the Australian Opera's Music Director, Edward Downes. (It had been intended that Peter Sculthorpe's work *Rites of Passage* would have this honour, but it was not ready on time. *Rites of Passage* was premiered almost exactly a year later, on 27 September 1974.)[*citation needed*]\n* The first public concert in the Concert Hall took place on 29 September 1973. It was an all-Wagner orchestral concert performed by the Sydney Symphony Orchestra,[77] conducted by Charles Mackerras and with Birgit Nilsson as the soprano soloist. The first music played was the Prelude to *Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg*. The concert closed with the Immolation Scene from *Götterdämmerung*.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAfter the opening:\n\n\n\n* The first violin and piano recital was given by Wanda Wiłkomirska, with pianist Geoffrey Parsons.[78]\n\n\n## Public and commemorative events[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Sydney Opera House during Vivid Sydney (2019)\nIn 1993, Constantine Koukias was commissioned by the Sydney Opera House Trust in association with REM Theatre to compose *Icon*, a large-scale music theatre piece for the 20th anniversary of the Sydney Opera House.[79]\n\n\nDuring the 2000 Summer Olympics, the venue served as the focal point for the triathlon events. The event had a 1.5 km (0.9 mi) swimming loop at Farm Cove, along with competitions in the neighbouring Royal Botanical Gardens for the cycling and running portions of the event.[80]\n\n\nSince 2013, a group of residents from the nearby Bennelong Apartments (better known as 'The Toaster'), calling themselves the Sydney Opera House Concerned Citizens Group, have been campaigning against Forecourt Concerts on the grounds that they exceed noise levels outlined in the development approval (DA). In February 2017 the NSW Department of Planning and the Environment handed down a $15,000 fine to the Sydney Opera House for breach of allowed noise levels at a concert held in November 2015. However, the DA was amended in 2016 to allow an increase in noise levels in the forecourt by 5 decibels. The residents opposing the concerts contend that a new DA should have been filed rather than an amendment.[81][82]\n\n\nThe Sydney Opera House sails formed a graphic projection-screen in a lightshow mounted in connection with the International Fleet Review in Sydney Harbour on 5 October 2013.[83]\n\n\nOn 31 December 2013, the venue's 40th anniversary year, a New Year fireworks display was mounted for the first time in a decade.[84] The Sydney Opera House hosted an event, 'the biggest blind date' on Friday 21 February 2014 that won an historic Guinness World Record.[85] The longest continuous serving employee was commemorated on 27 June 2018, for 50 years of service.[86]\n\n\nOn 14 June 2019, a state memorial service for former Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke was held at the Sydney Opera House.\n\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\nThe Opera House chief executive Louise Herron clashed with Sydney radio commentator Alan Jones on 5 October 2018. Jones called for her sacking for refusing to allow Racing NSW to use the Opera House sails to advertise The Everest horse race.[87][88] Within hours, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian overruled Herron. Two days later, Prime Minister Scott Morrison supported the decision, calling the Opera House \"the biggest billboard Sydney has\".[89] The NSW Labor Party leader, Luke Foley, and senior federal Labor frontbencher Anthony Albanese had supported the proposal.[90] The political view was not supported by significant public opinion, with a petition against the advertising collecting over 298,000 names by 9 October 2018.[91] 235,000 printed petition documents were presented to the NSW Parliament in the morning.[92] A survey conducted on 8 October by market research firm Micromex found that 81% of those surveyed were not supportive of the premier's direction.[93]\n\n\n\n### Coronation controversy[edit]\n\n\nIn 2023, the New South Wales Government scrapped plans to light the sails of the Sydney Opera House in honor of the coronation of King Charles.\n\n\nState Premier Chris Minns argued that the sails had been lit up too often and was costing significant taxpayer money, stating that the cost was somewhere between 80 and 100 thousand dollars.[94]\n\n\n\n## Notable performances[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

It was commissioned in 1631 by the fifth Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan (r. 1628–1658) to house the tomb of his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.\n\n\nConstruction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but work continued on other phases of the project for another 10 years. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around ₹32 million, which in 2023 would be approximately ₹35 billion.[7] The construction project employed some 20,000 artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by Ustad Ahmad Lahori, the emperor's court architect. Various types of symbolism have been employed in the Taj to reflect natural beauty and divinity.\n\n\nThe Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being \"the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage\". It is regarded by many as the best example of Mughal architecture and a symbol of India's rich history. The Taj Mahal attracts 7-8 million visitors a year,[8] and in 2007 it was declared a winner of the New 7 Wonders of the World (2000–2007) initiative.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nAbdul Hamid Lahori, in his book from 1636 *Padshahnama*, refers to the Taj Mahal as *rauza-i munawwara* (Perso-Arabic: روضه منواره, *rawdah-i munawwarah*), meaning the illumined or illustrious tomb.[9]\nThe current name for the Taj Mahal is of Urdu origin, and believed to be derived from Arabic and Persian, with the words *tāj mahall* meaning \"crown\" (*tāj*) \"palace\" (*mahall*).[10][11][4] The name \"Taj\" came from the corruption of the second syllable of \"Mumtaz\".[12][13]\n\n\n\n## Inspiration[edit]\n\n\nThe Taj Mahal was commissioned by Shah Jahan in 1631, to be built in the memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal, who died on 17 June that year, while giving birth to their 14th child, Gauhara Begum.[14][15] Construction started in 1632,[16] and the mausoleum was completed in 1648, while the surrounding buildings and garden were finished five years later.[17] The imperial court documenting Shah Jahan's grief after the death of Mumtaz Mahal illustrates the love story held as the inspiration for the Taj Mahal.[18] According to contemporary historians Muhammad Amin Qazvini, Abdul Hamid Lahori and Muhammad Saleh Kamboh, he did not show the same level of affection to others as he had shown her while she was alive. He avoided royal affairs for a week due to his grief, along with giving up listening to music and dressing lavishly for two years. Shah Jahan was enamored by the beauty of the land at the south side of Agra on which a mansion belonging to Raja Jai Singh I stood. This place was chosen for the construction of Mumtaz's tomb by Shah Jahan and Jai Singh agreed to donate it to the emperor.[19]\n\n\n\nShah Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal\n* ![\"Shah Jahan on a globe\" from the Smithsonian Institution](image)\n\n\"Shah Jahan on a globe\" from the Smithsonian Institution\n* ![Artistic depiction of Mumtaz Mahal](image)\n\nArtistic depiction of Mumtaz Mahal\n\n## Architecture and design[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Origins and architecture of the Taj Mahal\n\nAnimation showing the Taj Mahal (English subtitles)\nThe Taj Mahal incorporates and expands on design traditions of Indo-Islamic and earlier Mughal architecture. Specific inspiration came from successful Timurid and Mughal buildings including the Gur-e Amir (the tomb of Timur, progenitor of the Mughal dynasty, in Samarkand),[20] Humayun's Tomb which inspired the Charbagh gardens and hasht-behesht (architecture) plan of the site, Itmad-Ud-Daulah's Tomb (sometimes called the *Baby Taj*), and Shah Jahan's own Jama Masjid in Delhi. While earlier Mughal buildings were primarily constructed of red sandstone, Shah Jahan promoted the use of white marble inlaid with semi-precious stones. Buildings under his patronage reached new levels of refinement.[21]\n\n\n\n### Tomb[edit]\n\n\nThe tomb is the central focus of the entire complex of the Taj Mahal. It is a large, white marble structure standing on a square plinth and consists of a symmetrical building with an *iwan* (an arch-shaped doorway) topped by a large dome and finial. Like most Mughal tombs, the basic elements are Indo-Islamic in origin.[22]\n\n\nThe base structure is a large multi-chambered cube with chamfered corners forming an unequal eight-sided structure that is approximately 55 metres (180 ft) on each of the four long sides. Each side of the iwan is framed with a huge *pishtaq* or vaulted archway with two similarly shaped arched balconies stacked on either side. This motif of stacked *pishtaqs* is replicated on the chamfered corner areas, making the design completely symmetrical on all sides of the building. Four minarets frame the tomb, one at each corner of the plinth facing the chamfered corners. The main chamber houses the false sarcophagi of Mumtaz Mahal and Shah Jahan; the actual graves are at a lower level.[23]\n\n\n\nTaj Mahal gallery\n* ![The main gateway (darwaza) to the Taj Mahal](image)\n\nThe main gateway (darwaza) to the Taj Mahal\n* ![Taj Mahal minaret](image)\n\nTaj Mahal minaret\n* ![Taj Mahal at sunrise from Main Entrance](image)\n\nTaj Mahal at sunrise from Main Entrance\n* ![Sketch of the interior view of the vaulted dome over the tombs of Shah Jahan (left) and Mumtaz Mahal (right)](image)\n\nSketch of the interior view of the vaulted dome over the tombs of Shah Jahan (left) and Mumtaz Mahal (right)\n* ![The false sarcophagi of Mumtaz Mahal (right) and Shah Jahan (left) in the main chamber](image)\n\nThe false sarcophagi of Mumtaz Mahal (right) and Shah Jahan (left) in the main chamber\n* ![The actual tombs of Mumtaz Mahal (right) and Shah Jahan (left) in the lower level.

The dome is nearly 35 metres (115 ft) high which is close in measurement to the length of the base, and accentuated by the cylindrical \"drum\" it sits on, which is approximately 7 metres (23 ft) high. Because of its shape, the dome is often called an onion dome or *amrud* (guava dome).[24] The top is decorated with a lotus design which also serves to accentuate its height. The shape of the dome is emphasised by four smaller domed *chattris* (kiosks) placed at its corners, which replicate the onion shape of the main dome. The dome is slightly asymmetrical.[25] Their columned bases open through the roof of the tomb and provide light to the interior. Tall decorative spires (*guldastas*) extend from edges of base walls, and provide visual emphasis to the height of the dome. The lotus motif is repeated on both the *chattris* and *guldastas*. The dome and chattris are topped by a gilded finial which mixes traditional Persian and Hindustani decorative elements.[26]\n\n\nThe main finial was originally made of gold but was replaced by a copy made of gilded bronze in the early 19th century. This feature provides a clear example of integration of traditional Persian and Hindu decorative elements.[27] The finial is topped by a moon, a typical Islamic motif whose horns point heavenward.[28]\n\n\nThe minarets, which are each more than 40 metres (130 ft) tall, display the designer's penchant for symmetry. They were designed as working minarets – a traditional element of mosques, used by the muezzin to call the Islamic faithful to prayer. Each minaret is effectively divided into three equal parts by two working balconies that ring the tower. At the top of the tower is a final balcony surmounted by a chattri that mirrors the design of those on the tomb. The chattris all share the same decorative elements of a lotus design topped by a gilded finial. The minarets were constructed slightly outside of the plinth so that in the event of collapse, a typical occurrence with many tall constructions of the period, the material from the towers would tend to fall away from the tomb.[29]\n\n\n\n### Exterior decorations[edit]\n\n\nThe exterior decorations of the Taj Mahal are among the finest in Mughal architecture. As the surface area changes, the decorations are refined proportionally. The decorative elements were created by applying paint, stucco, stone inlays or carvings. In line with the Islamic prohibition against the use of anthropomorphic forms, the decorative elements can be grouped into either calligraphy, abstract forms or vegetative motifs.\nThroughout the complex are passages from the Qur'an that comprise some of the decorative elements. Recent scholarship suggests that Amanat Khan chose the passages.[30][31]\n\n\nThe calligraphy on the Great Gate reads \"O Soul, thou art at rest. Return to the Lord at peace with Him, and He at peace with you.\"[31] The calligraphy was created in 1609 by a calligrapher named Abdul Haq. Shah Jahan conferred the title of \"Amanat Khan\" upon him as a reward for his \"dazzling virtuosity\".[32] Near the lines from the Qur'an at the base of the interior dome is the inscription, \"Written by the insignificant being, Amanat Khan Shirazi\".[33] Much of the calligraphy is composed of florid thuluth script made of jasper or black marble[32] inlaid in white marble panels. Higher panels are written in slightly larger script to reduce the skewing effect when viewed from below. The calligraphy found on the marble cenotaphs in the tomb is particularly detailed and delicate.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAbstract forms are used throughout, especially in the plinth, minarets, gateway, mosque, jawab and, to a lesser extent, on the surfaces of the tomb. The domes and vaults of the sandstone buildings are worked with tracery of incised painting to create elaborate geometric forms. Herringbone inlays define the space between many of the adjoining elements. White inlays are used in sandstone buildings, and dark or black inlays on the white marbles. Mortared areas of the marble buildings have been stained or painted in a contrasting colour which creates a complex [*citation needed*] array of geometric patterns. Floors and walkways use contrasting tiles or blocks in tessellation patterns.[34]\n\n\nOn the lower walls of the tomb are white marble dados sculpted with realistic bas relief depictions of flowers and vines. The marble has been polished to emphasise the exquisite detailing of the carvings. The dado frames and archway spandrels have been decorated with pietra dura inlays of highly stylised, almost geometric vines, flowers and fruits. The inlay stones are of yellow marble, jasper and jade, polished and levelled to the surface of the walls.[32]\n\n\n\nDetailed exterior design\n* ![Taj Mahal Exterior with a minaret](image)\n\nTaj Mahal Exterior with a minaret\n* ![Detail of plant motifs on Taj Mahal wall](image)\n\nDetail of plant motifs on Taj Mahal wall\n* ![Base, dome and minaret](image)\n\nBase, dome and minaret\n* ![Finial, tamga of the Mughal Empire](image)\n\nFinial, tamga of the Mughal Empire\n* ![Plant motifs](image)\n\nPlant motifs\n* ![Reflective tiles](image)\n\nReflective tiles\n* ![Marble jali (latticed grill)](image)\n\nMarble jali (latticed grill)\n* ![Calligraphy of Arabic Ayaat](image)\n\nCalligraphy of Arabic Ayaat\n\n### Interior decoration[edit]\n\n\nThe interior chamber of the Taj Mahal reaches far beyond traditional decorative elements. The inlay work is not pietra dura, but a lapidary of precious and semiprecious gemstones.[35] The inner chamber is an octagon with the design allowing for entry from each face, although only the door facing the garden to the south is used. The interior walls are about 25 metres (82 ft) high and are topped by a \"false\" interior dome decorated with a sun motif. Eight pishtaq arches define the space at ground level and, as with the exterior, each lower pishtaq is crowned by a second pishtaq about midway up the wall.[36] The four central upper arches form balconies or viewing areas, and each balcony's exterior window has an intricate screen or *jali* a grill lattice cut from marble. In addition to the light from the balcony screens, light enters through roof openings covered by chattris at the corners. The octagonal marble screen or *jali* bordering the cenotaphs is made from eight marble panels carved through with intricate pierce work. The remaining surfaces are inlaid in delicate detail with semi-precious stones forming twining vines, fruits and flowers. Each chamber wall is highly decorated with dado bas-relief, intricate lapidary inlay and refined calligraphy panels which reflect, in little detail, the design elements seen throughout the exterior of the complex.[37]\n\n\n\nDetailed interior design\n* ![Flowers carved in marble](image)\n\nFlowers carved in marble\n* ![Detail of pietra dura jali inlay](image)\n\nDetail of *pietra dura* *jali* inlay\n* ![Delicacy of intricate pierce work](image)\n\nDelicacy of intricate pierce work\n* ![Archways in the mosque](image)\n\nArchways in the mosque\n* ![Incised painting](image)\n\nIncised painting\n* ![Finial floor tiling](image)\n\nFinial floor tiling\n* ![Detail of jali](image)\n\nDetail of *jali*\n* ![Pietra dura, or parchin kari, flowers](image)\n\n*Pietra dura*, or *parchin kari*, flowers\n\nMuslim tradition forbids elaborate decoration of graves. Hence, the bodies of Mumtaz and Shah Jahan were put in a relatively plain crypt beneath the inner chamber with their faces turned right, towards Mecca. Mumtaz Mahal's cenotaph is placed at the precise centre of the inner chamber on a rectangular marble base of 1.5 by 2.5 metres (4 ft 11 in by 8 ft 2 in). Both the base and casket are elaborately inlaid with precious and semiprecious gems. Calligraphic inscriptions on the casket identify and praise Mumtaz. On the lid of the casket is a raised rectangular lozenge meant to suggest a writing tablet. Shah Jahan's cenotaph is beside Mumtaz's to the western side and is the only visible asymmetric element in the entire complex. His cenotaph is bigger than his wife's, but reflects the same elements: a larger casket on a slightly taller base precisely decorated with lapidary and calligraphy that identifies him. On the lid of the casket is a traditional sculpture of a small pen box.[36]\n\n\nThe pen box and writing tablet are traditional Mughal funerary icons decorating the caskets of men and women respectively. The Ninety Nine Names of God are calligraphic inscriptions on the sides of the actual tomb of Mumtaz Mahal. Other inscriptions inside the crypt include: *O Noble, O Magnificent, O Majestic, O Unique, O Eternal, O Glorious...* . The Tomb of Shah Jahan bears a calligraphic inscription that reads: *He travelled from this world to the banquet-hall of Eternity on the night of the twenty-sixth of the month of Rajab, in the year 1076 Hijri*.[38]\n\n\n\n### Garden[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Walkways beside reflecting pool\nThe complex is set around a large 300-metre (980 ft) square *charbagh* or Mughal garden.\nThe garden uses raised pathways that divide each of the four-quarters of the garden into 16 sunken parterres or flowerbeds. Halfway between the tomb and gateway in the centre of the garden is a raised marble water tank with a reflecting pool positioned on a north–south axis to reflect the image of the mausoleum. The elevated marble water tank is called *al Hawd al-Kawthar* in reference to the \"Tank of Abundance\" promised to Muhammad.[39]\n\n\nElsewhere, the garden is laid out with avenues of trees labelled according to common and scientific names[40] and fountains. The charbagh garden, a design inspired by Persian gardens, was introduced to India by Babur, the first Mughal emperor. It symbolises the four flowing rivers of Jannah (Paradise) and reflects the Paradise garden derived from the Persian *paridaeza*, meaning 'walled garden.' In mystic Islamic texts of the Mughal period, Paradise is described as an ideal garden of abundance with four rivers flowing from a central spring or mountain, separating the garden into north, west, south and east.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n![](image)South-eastern view with lawn\nMost Mughal charbaghs are rectangular with a tomb or pavilion in the centre. The Taj Mahal garden is unusual in that the main element, the tomb, is located at the end of the garden. With the discovery of Mahtab Bagh or \"Moonlight Garden\" on the other side of the Yamuna, the interpretation of the Archaeological Survey of India is that the Yamuna river itself was incorporated into the garden's design and was meant to be seen as one of the rivers of Paradise.[41] Similarities in layout and architectural features with the Shalimar Gardens suggests both gardens may have been designed by the same architect, Ali Mardan.[42] Early accounts of the garden describe its profusion of vegetation, including abundant roses, daffodils, and fruit trees.[43] As the Mughal Empire declined, the Taj Mahal and its gardens also declined. By the 19th century, the British Empire controlled more than three-fifths of India,[44] and assumed management of the Taj Mahal. They changed the landscaping to their liking which more closely resembled the formal lawns of London.[45]\n\n\n\n### Outlying buildings[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The western building, a mosque, faces the tomb.\nThe Taj Mahal complex is bordered on three sides by crenellated red sandstone walls; the side facing the river is open. Outside the walls are several additional mausoleums, including those of Shah Jahan's other wives, and a larger tomb for Mumtaz's favourite servant.[*citation needed*] These structures, composed primarily of red sandstone, are typical of the smaller Mughal tombs of the era. The garden-facing inner sides of the wall are fronted by columned arcades, a feature typical of Hindu temples which was later incorporated into Mughal mosques. The wall is interspersed with domed *chattris*, and small buildings that may have been viewing areas or watch towers like the Music House, which is now used as a museum.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe main gateway (*darwaza*) is a monumental structure built primarily of marble, and reminiscent of the Mughal architecture of earlier emperors. Its archways mirror the shape of the tomb's archways, and its *pishtaq* arches incorporate the calligraphy that decorates the tomb. It uses bas-relief and pietra dura inlaid decorations with floral motifs. The vaulted ceilings and walls have elaborate geometric designs like those found in the other sandstone buildings in the complex.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAt the far end of the complex are two grand red sandstone buildings that mirror each other, and face the sides of the tomb. The backs of the buildings parallel the western and eastern walls. The western building is a mosque and the other is the *jawab* (answer), thought to have been constructed for architectural balance although it may have been used as a guesthouse. Distinctions between the two buildings include the *jawab's* lack of a *mihrab* (a niche in a mosque's wall facing Mecca), and its floors of geometric design whereas the floor of the mosque is laid with outlines of 569 prayer rugs in black marble. The mosque's basic design of a long hall surmounted by three domes is similar to others built by Shah Jahan, particularly the *Masjid-i Jahān-Numā*, or Jama Masjid, Delhi. The Mughal mosques of this period divide the sanctuary hall into three areas comprising a main sanctuary and slightly smaller sanctuaries on either side. At the Taj Mahal, each sanctuary opens onto an expansive vaulting dome. The outlying buildings were completed in 1643.[17]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nTaj Mahal and outlying buildings as seen from across the Yamuna River (northern view)\n\n## Construction[edit]\n\n\nThe Taj Mahal is built on a parcel of land to the south of the walled city of Agra. Shah Jahan presented Maharaja Jai Singh I with a large palace in the centre of Agra in exchange for the land.[46] An area of roughly 1.2 hectares (3 acres) was excavated, filled with dirt to reduce seepage, and levelled at 50 metres (160 ft) above the riverbank level. In the tomb area, piles were dug and filled with stone and rubble to form the footings of the tomb. Instead of lashed bamboo, workmen constructed a colossal brick scaffold that mirrored the tomb. The scaffold was so enormous that foremen expected it to take years to dismantle.[47]\n\n\nThe Taj Mahal was constructed using materials from all over India and Asia. It is believed over 1,000 elephants were used to transport building materials. Some 22,000 labourers, painters, embroidery artists and stonecutters were used.[48] The translucent white marble was brought from Makrana, Rajasthan, the jasper from the Punjab region, jade and crystal from China. The turquoise was from Tibet and the Lapis lazuli from Afghanistan, while the sapphire came from Sri Lanka and the carnelian from Arabia. In all, 28 types of precious and semi-precious stone were inlaid into the white marble.[49]\n\n\nAccording to the legend, Shah Jahan decreed that anyone could keep the bricks taken from the scaffold, and thus it was dismantled by peasants overnight.[50] A 15-kilometre (9.3 mi) tamped-earth ramp was built to transport marble and materials to the construction site and teams of 20 or 30 oxen pulled the blocks on specially constructed wagons.[51] An elaborate post-and-beam pulley system was used to raise the blocks into the desired position. Water was drawn from the river by a series of *purs*, an animal-powered rope and bucket mechanism, into a large storage tank and raised to a large distribution tank. It was passed into three subsidiary tanks, from which it was piped to the complex.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe plinth and tomb took some 12 years to complete. The remaining parts of the complex took an additional 10 years and were completed in order of minarets, mosque and jawab, and gateway. Since the complex was built in stages, discrepancies exist in completion dates due to differing opinions on \"completion\". Construction of the mausoleum itself was essentially completed by 1643[16] while work on the outlying buildings continued for years. Estimates of the cost of construction vary due to difficulties in estimating costs across time. The total cost at the time has been estimated to be about ₹ 32 million,[16] which is around ₹ 52.8 billion ($827 million US) based on 2015 values.[52]\n\n\n\n## Symbolism[edit]\n\n\nDue to the global attention that it has received and the millions of visitors it attracts, the Taj Mahal has become a prominent image that is associated with India, and in this way has become a symbol of India itself.[53]\n\n\nAlong with being a renowned symbol of love, the Taj Mahal is also a symbol of Shah Jahan's wealth and power, and the fact that the empire had prospered under his rule.[54] Bilateral symmetry dominated by a central axis has been used by rulers as a symbol of a ruling force that brings balance and harmony, and Shah Jahan applied that concept in the making of the Taj Mahal.[55] Additionally, the plan is aligned in the cardinal north–south direction and the corners have been placed so that when seen from the centre of the plan, the sun can be seen rising and setting on the north and south corners on the summer and winter solstices respectively. This makes the Taj a symbolic horizon.[56]\n\n\nThe planning and structure of the Taj Mahal, from the building itself to the gardens and beyond, is symbolic of Mumtaz Mahal's mansion in the garden of Paradise.[55] The concept of Gardens of Paradise is extended into the building of the mausoleum as well. Colorful vines and flowers decorate the interior, and are filled in with semi-precious stones using a technique called pietra dura, or as the Mughals called it, *parchin kari*.[57] The building appears to slightly change colour depending on the time of day and the weather. The sky has not only been incorporated in the design through the reflecting pools but also through the surface of the building itself. This is another way to imply the presence of Allah at the site.[58]\n\n\nAccording to Ebba Koch, art historian and international expert in the understanding and interpretation of Mughal architecture and the Taj Mahal, the planning of the entire compound of the Taj symbolises earthly life and the afterlife, a subset of the symbolisation of the divine. The plan has been split into two – one half is the white marble mausoleum itself and the gardens, and the other half is the red sandstone side meant for worldly markets. Only the mausoleum is white so as to represent the enlightenment, spirituality and faith of Mumtaz Mahal. According to the world-traveler Eleanor Roosevelt, the white symbolised the purity of real love.[59] Koch has deciphered that symbolic of Islamic teachings, the plan of the worldly side is a mirror image of the otherworldly side, and the grand gate in the middle represents the transition between the two worlds.\n\n\nThe Taj is also seen as a feminine architectural form, and is thought to embody Mumtaz Mahal herself.[60]\n\n\n\n## Later days[edit]\n\n\nSoon after the Taj Mahal's completion, Shah Jahan was deposed by his son Aurangzeb and put under house arrest at the nearby Agra Fort from where he could see the Taj Mahal. Upon Shah Jahan's death, Aurangzeb buried him in the mausoleum next to his wife.[61] In the 18th century, the Jat rulers of Bharatpur invaded Agra and attacked the Taj Mahal. They took away the two chandeliers, one of agate and another of silver, which were hung over the main cenotaph; they also took the gold and silver screen. Kanbo, a Mughal historian, said the gold shield which covered the 4.6-metre-high (15 ft) finial at the top of the main dome was also removed during the Jat despoilation.[62]\n\n\nBy the late 19th century, parts of the buildings had fallen into disrepair. At the end of the 19th century, British viceroy Lord Curzon ordered a sweeping restoration project, which was completed in 1908.[63] He also commissioned the large lamp in the interior chamber, modelled after one in a Cairo mosque. During this time, the garden was remodelled with European-style lawns that are still in place today.[64]\n\n\n\n## Threats[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Protective wartime scaffolding in 1942\nIn 1942, the government erected scaffolding to disguise the building in anticipation of air attacks by the Japanese Air Force.[65][66] During the India-Pakistan wars of 1965 and 1971, scaffolding was again erected to mislead bomber pilots.[67]\n\n\nMore recent threats have come from environmental pollution on the banks of the Yamuna River including acid rain[68] due to the Mathura Oil Refinery,[69] which was opposed by Supreme Court of India directives.[70] The pollution has been turning the Taj Mahal yellow-brown.[71][72] To help control the pollution, the Indian government has set up the \"Taj Trapezium Zone (TTZ)\", a 10,400-square-kilometre (4,000 sq mi) area around the monument where strict emissions standards are in place.[73]\n\n\nConcerns for the tomb's structural integrity have recently been raised because of a decline in the groundwater level in the Yamuna river basin which is falling at a rate of around 1.5 m (5 ft) per year. In 2010, cracks appeared in parts of the tomb, and the minarets which surround the monument were showing signs of tilting, as the wooden foundation of the tomb may be rotting due to lack of water. It has been pointed out by politicians, however, that the minarets are designed to tilt slightly outwards to prevent them from crashing on top of the tomb in the event of an earthquake. In 2011, it was reported that some predictions indicated that the tomb could collapse within five years.[74]\n\n\nSmall minarets located at two of the outlying buildings were reported as damaged by a storm on 11 April 2018.[75] On 31 May 2020 another fierce thunderstorm caused some damage to the complex.[76]\n\n\n\n## Tourism[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Visitors at Taj Mahal\nThe Taj Mahal attracts a large number of tourists. UNESCO documented more than 2 million visitors in 2001,[77] which had increased to about 7–8 million in 2014.[78] A three-tier pricing system is in place, with a significantly lower entrance fee for Indian citizens and more expensive ones for foreigners. As of 2022[update], the fee for Indian citizens was ₹50, for citizens of SAARC and BIMSTEC countries, it was ₹540 and for other foreign tourists, it was ₹1,100.[79] Most tourists visit in the cooler months of October, November and February. Polluting traffic is not allowed near the complex and tourists must either walk from parking areas or catch an electric bus. The Khawasspuras (northern courtyards) are currently being restored for use as a new visitor centre.[80][81] In 2019, to address overtourism, the site instituted fines for visitors who stayed longer than three hours.[82]\n\n\nThe small town to the south of the Taj, known as Taj Ganji or Mumtazabad, was initially constructed with caravanserais, bazaars and markets to serve the needs of visitors and workers.[83] Lists of recommended travel destinations often feature the Taj Mahal, which also appears in several listings of seven wonders of the modern world, including the recently announced New Seven Wonders of the World, a recent poll with 100 million votes.[84]\n\n\nThe grounds are open from 06:00 to 19:00 hours on weekdays, except on Friday when the complex is open for prayers at the mosque between 12:00 and 14:00 hours. The complex is open for night viewing on the day of the full moon and two days before and after,[85] excluding Fridays and the month of Ramadan.\n\n\nForeign dignitaries often visit the Taj Mahal on trips to India. Notable figures who have travelled to the site include Dwight Eisenhower, Jacqueline Kennedy, Jimmy Carter, George H. W. Bush, George Harrison, Vladimir Putin, Princess Diana, Donald Trump, Justin Trudeau, Prince Charles, Queen Elizabeth, and Prince Philip.[86][87][88][89]\n\n\n\n## Myths[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jean-Baptiste Tavernier, one of the first European writers about the Taj Mahal\nEver since its construction, the building has been the source of an admiration transcending culture and geography, and so personal and emotional responses have consistently eclipsed scholastic appraisals of the monument.[90] A longstanding myth holds that Shah Jahan planned a mausoleum to be built in black marble as a Black Taj Mahal across the Yamuna river.[14] The idea originates from fanciful writings of Jean-Baptiste Tavernier, a European traveller who visited Agra in 1665. It was suggested that his son Aurangzeb overthrew Shah Jahan before it could be built. Ruins of blackened marble across the river in the Mehtab Bagh, seemed to support this legend. However, excavations carried out in the 1990s found that they were discoloured white stones that had turned black.[91] A more credible theory for the origins of the black mausoleum was demonstrated in 2006 by archaeologists who reconstructed part of the pool in the Mehtab Bagh. A dark reflection of the white mausoleum could clearly be seen, befitting Shah Jahan's obsession with symmetry and the positioning of the pool itself.[92]\n\n\nNo concrete evidence exists for claims that describe, often in horrific detail, the deaths, dismemberments and mutilations which Shah Jahan supposedly inflicted on various architects and craftsmen associated with the tomb.[93][94] Some stories claim that those involved in construction signed contracts committing themselves to have no part in any similar design. Similar claims are made for many famous buildings.[95] No evidence exists for claims that Lord William Bentinck, governor-general of India in the 1830s, supposedly planned to demolish the Taj Mahal and auction off the marble. Bentinck's biographer John Rosselli says that the story arose from Bentinck's fund-raising sale of discarded marble from Agra Fort.[96]\n\n\nAnother myth suggests that beating the silhouette of the finial will cause water to come forth. To this day, officials find broken bangles surrounding the silhouette.[97]\n\n\nSeveral myths, none of which are supported by the archaeological record, have appeared asserting that people other than Shah Jahan and the original architects were responsible for the construction of the Taj Mahal. For instance, in 2000, India's Supreme Court dismissed P. N. Oak's petition[98] to declare that a Hindu king built the Taj Mahal.[95][99] In 2005, a similar petition was dismissed by the Allahabad High Court. This case was brought by Amar Nath Mishra, a social worker and preacher who claimed that the Taj Mahal was built by the Hindu King Parmal Dev in 1196.[100]\n\n\nAnother such unsupported theory is that the Taj Mahal was designed by an Italian, Geronimo Vereneo, held sway for a brief period after it was first promoted by Henry George Keene in 1879 who went by a translation of a Spanish work *Itinerario*, (*The Travels of Fray Sebastian Manrique, 1629–1643*). Another theory that a Frenchman, Austin of Bordeaux designed the Taj was promoted by William Henry Sleeman based on the work of Jean-Baptiste Tavernier. These ideas were revived by Father Hosten and discussed again by E.B. Havell and served as the basis for subsequent theories and controversies.[101]\n\n\nAs of 2017, several court cases about Taj Mahal being a Hindu temple have been inspired by P. N. Oak's theory.[102][103] In August 2017, Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) stated there was no evidence to suggest the monument ever housed a temple.[104] Bharatiya Janata Party's Vinay Katiyar in 2017 claimed that the 17th century monument was built by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan after destroying a Hindu temple called \"Tejo Mahalaya\" and it housed a Shiva linga. This claim had also been made by another BJP member Laxmikant Bajpai in 2014. The BJP government's Union Minister of Culture Mahesh Sharma stated in November 2015 during a session of the parliament, that there was no evidence that it was a temple. The theories about Taj Mahal being a Shiva temple started circulating when Oak released his 1989 book *Taj Mahal: The True Story*. He claimed it was built in 1155 AD and not in the 17th century, as stated by the ASI.[105]\n\n\n\n## Gallery[edit]\n\n\n* Taj Mahal\n* ![Eastern view in the morning](image)\n\nEastern view in the morning\n* ![Taj Mahal in cloudy weather and its minaret under restoration](image)\n\nTaj Mahal in cloudy weather and its minaret under restoration\n* ![Western view at sunset](image)\n\nWestern view at sunset\n* ![Taj Mahal through the fog](image)\n\nTaj Mahal through the fog\n* ![A panoramic view looking 360 degrees around the Taj Mahal in 2005](image)\n\nA panoramic view looking 360 degrees around the Taj Mahal in 2005\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)India portal\n* ![](image)Islam portal\n* ![icon](image)Architecture portal\n\n\n* Architecture of India\n* Bibi Ka Maqbara, a similar building in the Deccan, Aurangabad\n* Fatehpur Sikri, a nearby city and World Heritage Site\n* Islamic architecture\n* Indo-Islamic architecture\n* *Inside*, a 1968 new-age music album recorded in the building\n* List of tallest domes\n* List of tallest structures built before the 20th century\n* New 7 Wonders of the World\n* Taj Mahal replicas and derivatives\n* Wonders of the World\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Taj Mahal\". *UNESCO Culture World Heritage Centre, World Heritage List*.

It was commissioned in 1631 by the fifth Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan (r. 1628–1658) to house the tomb of his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.\n\n\nConstruction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but work continued on other phases of the project for another 10 years. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around ₹32 million, which in 2023 would be approximately ₹35 billion.[7] The construction project employed some 20,000 artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by Ustad Ahmad Lahori, the emperor's court architect. Various types of symbolism have been employed in the Taj to reflect natural beauty and divinity.\n\n\nThe Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being \"the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage\". It is regarded by many as the best example of Mughal architecture and a symbol of India's rich history. The Taj Mahal attracts 7-8 million visitors a year,[8] and in 2007 it was declared a winner of the New 7 Wonders of the World (2000–2007) initiative.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nAbdul Hamid Lahori, in his book from 1636 *Padshahnama*, refers to the Taj Mahal as *rauza-i munawwara* (Perso-Arabic: روضه منواره, *rawdah-i munawwarah*), meaning the illumined or illustrious tomb.[9]\nThe current name for the Taj Mahal is of Urdu origin, and believed to be derived from Arabic and Persian, with the words *tāj mahall* meaning \"crown\" (*tāj*) \"palace\" (*mahall*).[10][11][4] The name \"Taj\" came from the corruption of the second syllable of \"Mumtaz\".[12][13]\n\n\n\n## Inspiration[edit]\n\n\nThe Taj Mahal was commissioned by Shah Jahan in 1631, to be built in the memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal, who died on 17 June that year, while giving birth to their 14th child, Gauhara Begum.[14][15] Construction started in 1632,[16] and the mausoleum was completed in 1648, while the surrounding buildings and garden were finished five years later.[17] The imperial court documenting Shah Jahan's grief after the death of Mumtaz Mahal illustrates the love story held as the inspiration for the Taj Mahal.[18] According to contemporary historians Muhammad Amin Qazvini, Abdul Hamid Lahori and Muhammad Saleh Kamboh, he did not show the same level of affection to others as he had shown her while she was alive. He avoided royal affairs for a week due to his grief, along with giving up listening to music and dressing lavishly for two years. Shah Jahan was enamored by the beauty of the land at the south side of Agra on which a mansion belonging to Raja Jai Singh I stood. This place was chosen for the construction of Mumtaz's tomb by Shah Jahan and Jai Singh agreed to donate it to the emperor.[19]\n\n\n\nShah Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal\n* ![\"Shah Jahan on a globe\" from the Smithsonian Institution](image)\n\n\"Shah Jahan on a globe\" from the Smithsonian Institution\n* ![Artistic depiction of Mumtaz Mahal](image)\n\nArtistic depiction of Mumtaz Mahal\n\n## Architecture and design[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Origins and architecture of the Taj Mahal\n\nAnimation showing the Taj Mahal (English subtitles)\nThe Taj Mahal incorporates and expands on design traditions of Indo-Islamic and earlier Mughal architecture. Specific inspiration came from successful Timurid and Mughal buildings including the Gur-e Amir (the tomb of Timur, progenitor of the Mughal dynasty, in Samarkand),[20] Humayun's Tomb which inspired the Charbagh gardens and hasht-behesht (architecture) plan of the site, Itmad-Ud-Daulah's Tomb (sometimes called the *Baby Taj*), and Shah Jahan's own Jama Masjid in Delhi. While earlier Mughal buildings were primarily constructed of red sandstone, Shah Jahan promoted the use of white marble inlaid with semi-precious stones. Buildings under his patronage reached new levels of refinement.[21]\n\n\n\n### Tomb[edit]\n\n\nThe tomb is the central focus of the entire complex of the Taj Mahal. It is a large, white marble structure standing on a square plinth and consists of a symmetrical building with an *iwan* (an arch-shaped doorway) topped by a large dome and finial. Like most Mughal tombs, the basic elements are Indo-Islamic in origin.[22]\n\n\nThe base structure is a large multi-chambered cube with chamfered corners forming an unequal eight-sided structure that is approximately 55 metres (180 ft) on each of the four long sides. Each side of the iwan is framed with a huge *pishtaq* or vaulted archway with two similarly shaped arched balconies stacked on either side. This motif of stacked *pishtaqs* is replicated on the chamfered corner areas, making the design completely symmetrical on all sides of the building. Four minarets frame the tomb, one at each corner of the plinth facing the chamfered corners. The main chamber houses the false sarcophagi of Mumtaz Mahal and Shah Jahan; the actual graves are at a lower level.[23]\n\n\n\nTaj Mahal gallery\n* ![The main gateway (darwaza) to the Taj Mahal](image)\n\nThe main gateway (darwaza) to the Taj Mahal\n* ![Taj Mahal minaret](image)\n\nTaj Mahal minaret\n* ![Taj Mahal at sunrise from Main Entrance](image)\n\nTaj Mahal at sunrise from Main Entrance\n* ![Sketch of the interior view of the vaulted dome over the tombs of Shah Jahan (left) and Mumtaz Mahal (right)](image)\n\nSketch of the interior view of the vaulted dome over the tombs of Shah Jahan (left) and Mumtaz Mahal (right)\n* ![The false sarcophagi of Mumtaz Mahal (right) and Shah Jahan (left) in the main chamber](image)\n\nThe false sarcophagi of Mumtaz Mahal (right) and Shah Jahan (left) in the main chamber\n* ![The actual tombs of Mumtaz Mahal (right) and Shah Jahan (left) in the lower level.

The dome is nearly 35 metres (115 ft) high which is close in measurement to the length of the base, and accentuated by the cylindrical \"drum\" it sits on, which is approximately 7 metres (23 ft) high. Because of its shape, the dome is often called an onion dome or *amrud* (guava dome).[24] The top is decorated with a lotus design which also serves to accentuate its height. The shape of the dome is emphasised by four smaller domed *chattris* (kiosks) placed at its corners, which replicate the onion shape of the main dome. The dome is slightly asymmetrical.[25] Their columned bases open through the roof of the tomb and provide light to the interior. Tall decorative spires (*guldastas*) extend from edges of base walls, and provide visual emphasis to the height of the dome. The lotus motif is repeated on both the *chattris* and *guldastas*. The dome and chattris are topped by a gilded finial which mixes traditional Persian and Hindustani decorative elements.[26]\n\n\nThe main finial was originally made of gold but was replaced by a copy made of gilded bronze in the early 19th century. This feature provides a clear example of integration of traditional Persian and Hindu decorative elements.[27] The finial is topped by a moon, a typical Islamic motif whose horns point heavenward.[28]\n\n\nThe minarets, which are each more than 40 metres (130 ft) tall, display the designer's penchant for symmetry. They were designed as working minarets – a traditional element of mosques, used by the muezzin to call the Islamic faithful to prayer. Each minaret is effectively divided into three equal parts by two working balconies that ring the tower. At the top of the tower is a final balcony surmounted by a chattri that mirrors the design of those on the tomb. The chattris all share the same decorative elements of a lotus design topped by a gilded finial. The minarets were constructed slightly outside of the plinth so that in the event of collapse, a typical occurrence with many tall constructions of the period, the material from the towers would tend to fall away from the tomb.[29]\n\n\n\n### Exterior decorations[edit]\n\n\nThe exterior decorations of the Taj Mahal are among the finest in Mughal architecture. As the surface area changes, the decorations are refined proportionally. The decorative elements were created by applying paint, stucco, stone inlays or carvings. In line with the Islamic prohibition against the use of anthropomorphic forms, the decorative elements can be grouped into either calligraphy, abstract forms or vegetative motifs.\nThroughout the complex are passages from the Qur'an that comprise some of the decorative elements. Recent scholarship suggests that Amanat Khan chose the passages.[30][31]\n\n\nThe calligraphy on the Great Gate reads \"O Soul, thou art at rest. Return to the Lord at peace with Him, and He at peace with you.\"[31] The calligraphy was created in 1609 by a calligrapher named Abdul Haq. Shah Jahan conferred the title of \"Amanat Khan\" upon him as a reward for his \"dazzling virtuosity\".[32] Near the lines from the Qur'an at the base of the interior dome is the inscription, \"Written by the insignificant being, Amanat Khan Shirazi\".[33] Much of the calligraphy is composed of florid thuluth script made of jasper or black marble[32] inlaid in white marble panels. Higher panels are written in slightly larger script to reduce the skewing effect when viewed from below. The calligraphy found on the marble cenotaphs in the tomb is particularly detailed and delicate.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAbstract forms are used throughout, especially in the plinth, minarets, gateway, mosque, jawab and, to a lesser extent, on the surfaces of the tomb. The domes and vaults of the sandstone buildings are worked with tracery of incised painting to create elaborate geometric forms. Herringbone inlays define the space between many of the adjoining elements. White inlays are used in sandstone buildings, and dark or black inlays on the white marbles. Mortared areas of the marble buildings have been stained or painted in a contrasting colour which creates a complex [*citation needed*] array of geometric patterns. Floors and walkways use contrasting tiles or blocks in tessellation patterns.[34]\n\n\nOn the lower walls of the tomb are white marble dados sculpted with realistic bas relief depictions of flowers and vines. The marble has been polished to emphasise the exquisite detailing of the carvings. The dado frames and archway spandrels have been decorated with pietra dura inlays of highly stylised, almost geometric vines, flowers and fruits. The inlay stones are of yellow marble, jasper and jade, polished and levelled to the surface of the walls.[32]\n\n\n\nDetailed exterior design\n* ![Taj Mahal Exterior with a minaret](image)\n\nTaj Mahal Exterior with a minaret\n* ![Detail of plant motifs on Taj Mahal wall](image)\n\nDetail of plant motifs on Taj Mahal wall\n* ![Base, dome and minaret](image)\n\nBase, dome and minaret\n* ![Finial, tamga of the Mughal Empire](image)\n\nFinial, tamga of the Mughal Empire\n* ![Plant motifs](image)\n\nPlant motifs\n* ![Reflective tiles](image)\n\nReflective tiles\n* ![Marble jali (latticed grill)](image)\n\nMarble jali (latticed grill)\n* ![Calligraphy of Arabic Ayaat](image)\n\nCalligraphy of Arabic Ayaat\n\n### Interior decoration[edit]\n\n\nThe interior chamber of the Taj Mahal reaches far beyond traditional decorative elements. The inlay work is not pietra dura, but a lapidary of precious and semiprecious gemstones.[35] The inner chamber is an octagon with the design allowing for entry from each face, although only the door facing the garden to the south is used. The interior walls are about 25 metres (82 ft) high and are topped by a \"false\" interior dome decorated with a sun motif. Eight pishtaq arches define the space at ground level and, as with the exterior, each lower pishtaq is crowned by a second pishtaq about midway up the wall.[36] The four central upper arches form balconies or viewing areas, and each balcony's exterior window has an intricate screen or *jali* a grill lattice cut from marble. In addition to the light from the balcony screens, light enters through roof openings covered by chattris at the corners. The octagonal marble screen or *jali* bordering the cenotaphs is made from eight marble panels carved through with intricate pierce work. The remaining surfaces are inlaid in delicate detail with semi-precious stones forming twining vines, fruits and flowers. Each chamber wall is highly decorated with dado bas-relief, intricate lapidary inlay and refined calligraphy panels which reflect, in little detail, the design elements seen throughout the exterior of the complex.[37]\n\n\n\nDetailed interior design\n* ![Flowers carved in marble](image)\n\nFlowers carved in marble\n* ![Detail of pietra dura jali inlay](image)\n\nDetail of *pietra dura* *jali* inlay\n* ![Delicacy of intricate pierce work](image)\n\nDelicacy of intricate pierce work\n* ![Archways in the mosque](image)\n\nArchways in the mosque\n* ![Incised painting](image)\n\nIncised painting\n* ![Finial floor tiling](image)\n\nFinial floor tiling\n* ![Detail of jali](image)\n\nDetail of *jali*\n* ![Pietra dura, or parchin kari, flowers](image)\n\n*Pietra dura*, or *parchin kari*, flowers\n\nMuslim tradition forbids elaborate decoration of graves. Hence, the bodies of Mumtaz and Shah Jahan were put in a relatively plain crypt beneath the inner chamber with their faces turned right, towards Mecca. Mumtaz Mahal's cenotaph is placed at the precise centre of the inner chamber on a rectangular marble base of 1.5 by 2.5 metres (4 ft 11 in by 8 ft 2 in). Both the base and casket are elaborately inlaid with precious and semiprecious gems. Calligraphic inscriptions on the casket identify and praise Mumtaz. On the lid of the casket is a raised rectangular lozenge meant to suggest a writing tablet. Shah Jahan's cenotaph is beside Mumtaz's to the western side and is the only visible asymmetric element in the entire complex. His cenotaph is bigger than his wife's, but reflects the same elements: a larger casket on a slightly taller base precisely decorated with lapidary and calligraphy that identifies him. On the lid of the casket is a traditional sculpture of a small pen box.[36]\n\n\nThe pen box and writing tablet are traditional Mughal funerary icons decorating the caskets of men and women respectively. The Ninety Nine Names of God are calligraphic inscriptions on the sides of the actual tomb of Mumtaz Mahal. Other inscriptions inside the crypt include: *O Noble, O Magnificent, O Majestic, O Unique, O Eternal, O Glorious...* . The Tomb of Shah Jahan bears a calligraphic inscription that reads: *He travelled from this world to the banquet-hall of Eternity on the night of the twenty-sixth of the month of Rajab, in the year 1076 Hijri*.[38]\n\n\n\n### Garden[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Walkways beside reflecting pool\nThe complex is set around a large 300-metre (980 ft) square *charbagh* or Mughal garden.\nThe garden uses raised pathways that divide each of the four-quarters of the garden into 16 sunken parterres or flowerbeds. Halfway between the tomb and gateway in the centre of the garden is a raised marble water tank with a reflecting pool positioned on a north–south axis to reflect the image of the mausoleum. The elevated marble water tank is called *al Hawd al-Kawthar* in reference to the \"Tank of Abundance\" promised to Muhammad.[39]\n\n\nElsewhere, the garden is laid out with avenues of trees labelled according to common and scientific names[40] and fountains. The charbagh garden, a design inspired by Persian gardens, was introduced to India by Babur, the first Mughal emperor. It symbolises the four flowing rivers of Jannah (Paradise) and reflects the Paradise garden derived from the Persian *paridaeza*, meaning 'walled garden.' In mystic Islamic texts of the Mughal period, Paradise is described as an ideal garden of abundance with four rivers flowing from a central spring or mountain, separating the garden into north, west, south and east.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n![](image)South-eastern view with lawn\nMost Mughal charbaghs are rectangular with a tomb or pavilion in the centre. The Taj Mahal garden is unusual in that the main element, the tomb, is located at the end of the garden. With the discovery of Mahtab Bagh or \"Moonlight Garden\" on the other side of the Yamuna, the interpretation of the Archaeological Survey of India is that the Yamuna river itself was incorporated into the garden's design and was meant to be seen as one of the rivers of Paradise.[41] Similarities in layout and architectural features with the Shalimar Gardens suggests both gardens may have been designed by the same architect, Ali Mardan.[42] Early accounts of the garden describe its profusion of vegetation, including abundant roses, daffodils, and fruit trees.[43] As the Mughal Empire declined, the Taj Mahal and its gardens also declined. By the 19th century, the British Empire controlled more than three-fifths of India,[44] and assumed management of the Taj Mahal. They changed the landscaping to their liking which more closely resembled the formal lawns of London.[45]\n\n\n\n### Outlying buildings[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The western building, a mosque, faces the tomb.\nThe Taj Mahal complex is bordered on three sides by crenellated red sandstone walls; the side facing the river is open. Outside the walls are several additional mausoleums, including those of Shah Jahan's other wives, and a larger tomb for Mumtaz's favourite servant.[*citation needed*] These structures, composed primarily of red sandstone, are typical of the smaller Mughal tombs of the era. The garden-facing inner sides of the wall are fronted by columned arcades, a feature typical of Hindu temples which was later incorporated into Mughal mosques. The wall is interspersed with domed *chattris*, and small buildings that may have been viewing areas or watch towers like the Music House, which is now used as a museum.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe main gateway (*darwaza*) is a monumental structure built primarily of marble, and reminiscent of the Mughal architecture of earlier emperors. Its archways mirror the shape of the tomb's archways, and its *pishtaq* arches incorporate the calligraphy that decorates the tomb. It uses bas-relief and pietra dura inlaid decorations with floral motifs. The vaulted ceilings and walls have elaborate geometric designs like those found in the other sandstone buildings in the complex.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAt the far end of the complex are two grand red sandstone buildings that mirror each other, and face the sides of the tomb. The backs of the buildings parallel the western and eastern walls. The western building is a mosque and the other is the *jawab* (answer), thought to have been constructed for architectural balance although it may have been used as a guesthouse. Distinctions between the two buildings include the *jawab's* lack of a *mihrab* (a niche in a mosque's wall facing Mecca), and its floors of geometric design whereas the floor of the mosque is laid with outlines of 569 prayer rugs in black marble. The mosque's basic design of a long hall surmounted by three domes is similar to others built by Shah Jahan, particularly the *Masjid-i Jahān-Numā*, or Jama Masjid, Delhi. The Mughal mosques of this period divide the sanctuary hall into three areas comprising a main sanctuary and slightly smaller sanctuaries on either side. At the Taj Mahal, each sanctuary opens onto an expansive vaulting dome. The outlying buildings were completed in 1643.[17]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nTaj Mahal and outlying buildings as seen from across the Yamuna River (northern view)\n\n## Construction[edit]\n\n\nThe Taj Mahal is built on a parcel of land to the south of the walled city of Agra. Shah Jahan presented Maharaja Jai Singh I with a large palace in the centre of Agra in exchange for the land.[46] An area of roughly 1.2 hectares (3 acres) was excavated, filled with dirt to reduce seepage, and levelled at 50 metres (160 ft) above the riverbank level. In the tomb area, piles were dug and filled with stone and rubble to form the footings of the tomb. Instead of lashed bamboo, workmen constructed a colossal brick scaffold that mirrored the tomb. The scaffold was so enormous that foremen expected it to take years to dismantle.[47]\n\n\nThe Taj Mahal was constructed using materials from all over India and Asia. It is believed over 1,000 elephants were used to transport building materials. Some 22,000 labourers, painters, embroidery artists and stonecutters were used.[48] The translucent white marble was brought from Makrana, Rajasthan, the jasper from the Punjab region, jade and crystal from China. The turquoise was from Tibet and the Lapis lazuli from Afghanistan, while the sapphire came from Sri Lanka and the carnelian from Arabia. In all, 28 types of precious and semi-precious stone were inlaid into the white marble.[49]\n\n\nAccording to the legend, Shah Jahan decreed that anyone could keep the bricks taken from the scaffold, and thus it was dismantled by peasants overnight.[50] A 15-kilometre (9.3 mi) tamped-earth ramp was built to transport marble and materials to the construction site and teams of 20 or 30 oxen pulled the blocks on specially constructed wagons.[51] An elaborate post-and-beam pulley system was used to raise the blocks into the desired position. Water was drawn from the river by a series of *purs*, an animal-powered rope and bucket mechanism, into a large storage tank and raised to a large distribution tank. It was passed into three subsidiary tanks, from which it was piped to the complex.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe plinth and tomb took some 12 years to complete. The remaining parts of the complex took an additional 10 years and were completed in order of minarets, mosque and jawab, and gateway. Since the complex was built in stages, discrepancies exist in completion dates due to differing opinions on \"completion\". Construction of the mausoleum itself was essentially completed by 1643[16] while work on the outlying buildings continued for years. Estimates of the cost of construction vary due to difficulties in estimating costs across time. The total cost at the time has been estimated to be about ₹ 32 million,[16] which is around ₹ 52.8 billion ($827 million US) based on 2015 values.[52]\n\n\n\n## Symbolism[edit]\n\n\nDue to the global attention that it has received and the millions of visitors it attracts, the Taj Mahal has become a prominent image that is associated with India, and in this way has become a symbol of India itself.[53]\n\n\nAlong with being a renowned symbol of love, the Taj Mahal is also a symbol of Shah Jahan's wealth and power, and the fact that the empire had prospered under his rule.[54] Bilateral symmetry dominated by a central axis has been used by rulers as a symbol of a ruling force that brings balance and harmony, and Shah Jahan applied that concept in the making of the Taj Mahal.[55] Additionally, the plan is aligned in the cardinal north–south direction and the corners have been placed so that when seen from the centre of the plan, the sun can be seen rising and setting on the north and south corners on the summer and winter solstices respectively. This makes the Taj a symbolic horizon.[56]\n\n\nThe planning and structure of the Taj Mahal, from the building itself to the gardens and beyond, is symbolic of Mumtaz Mahal's mansion in the garden of Paradise.[55] The concept of Gardens of Paradise is extended into the building of the mausoleum as well. Colorful vines and flowers decorate the interior, and are filled in with semi-precious stones using a technique called pietra dura, or as the Mughals called it, *parchin kari*.[57] The building appears to slightly change colour depending on the time of day and the weather. The sky has not only been incorporated in the design through the reflecting pools but also through the surface of the building itself. This is another way to imply the presence of Allah at the site.[58]\n\n\nAccording to Ebba Koch, art historian and international expert in the understanding and interpretation of Mughal architecture and the Taj Mahal, the planning of the entire compound of the Taj symbolises earthly life and the afterlife, a subset of the symbolisation of the divine. The plan has been split into two – one half is the white marble mausoleum itself and the gardens, and the other half is the red sandstone side meant for worldly markets. Only the mausoleum is white so as to represent the enlightenment, spirituality and faith of Mumtaz Mahal. According to the world-traveler Eleanor Roosevelt, the white symbolised the purity of real love.[59] Koch has deciphered that symbolic of Islamic teachings, the plan of the worldly side is a mirror image of the otherworldly side, and the grand gate in the middle represents the transition between the two worlds.\n\n\nThe Taj is also seen as a feminine architectural form, and is thought to embody Mumtaz Mahal herself.[60]\n\n\n\n## Later days[edit]\n\n\nSoon after the Taj Mahal's completion, Shah Jahan was deposed by his son Aurangzeb and put under house arrest at the nearby Agra Fort from where he could see the Taj Mahal. Upon Shah Jahan's death, Aurangzeb buried him in the mausoleum next to his wife.[61] In the 18th century, the Jat rulers of Bharatpur invaded Agra and attacked the Taj Mahal. They took away the two chandeliers, one of agate and another of silver, which were hung over the main cenotaph; they also took the gold and silver screen. Kanbo, a Mughal historian, said the gold shield which covered the 4.6-metre-high (15 ft) finial at the top of the main dome was also removed during the Jat despoilation.[62]\n\n\nBy the late 19th century, parts of the buildings had fallen into disrepair. At the end of the 19th century, British viceroy Lord Curzon ordered a sweeping restoration project, which was completed in 1908.[63] He also commissioned the large lamp in the interior chamber, modelled after one in a Cairo mosque. During this time, the garden was remodelled with European-style lawns that are still in place today.[64]\n\n\n\n## Threats[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Protective wartime scaffolding in 1942\nIn 1942, the government erected scaffolding to disguise the building in anticipation of air attacks by the Japanese Air Force.[65][66] During the India-Pakistan wars of 1965 and 1971, scaffolding was again erected to mislead bomber pilots.[67]\n\n\nMore recent threats have come from environmental pollution on the banks of the Yamuna River including acid rain[68] due to the Mathura Oil Refinery,[69] which was opposed by Supreme Court of India directives.[70] The pollution has been turning the Taj Mahal yellow-brown.[71][72] To help control the pollution, the Indian government has set up the \"Taj Trapezium Zone (TTZ)\", a 10,400-square-kilometre (4,000 sq mi) area around the monument where strict emissions standards are in place.[73]\n\n\nConcerns for the tomb's structural integrity have recently been raised because of a decline in the groundwater level in the Yamuna river basin which is falling at a rate of around 1.5 m (5 ft) per year. In 2010, cracks appeared in parts of the tomb, and the minarets which surround the monument were showing signs of tilting, as the wooden foundation of the tomb may be rotting due to lack of water. It has been pointed out by politicians, however, that the minarets are designed to tilt slightly outwards to prevent them from crashing on top of the tomb in the event of an earthquake. In 2011, it was reported that some predictions indicated that the tomb could collapse within five years.[74]\n\n\nSmall minarets located at two of the outlying buildings were reported as damaged by a storm on 11 April 2018.[75] On 31 May 2020 another fierce thunderstorm caused some damage to the complex.[76]\n\n\n\n## Tourism[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Visitors at Taj Mahal\nThe Taj Mahal attracts a large number of tourists. UNESCO documented more than 2 million visitors in 2001,[77] which had increased to about 7–8 million in 2014.[78] A three-tier pricing system is in place, with a significantly lower entrance fee for Indian citizens and more expensive ones for foreigners. As of 2022[update], the fee for Indian citizens was ₹50, for citizens of SAARC and BIMSTEC countries, it was ₹540 and for other foreign tourists, it was ₹1,100.[79] Most tourists visit in the cooler months of October, November and February. Polluting traffic is not allowed near the complex and tourists must either walk from parking areas or catch an electric bus. The Khawasspuras (northern courtyards) are currently being restored for use as a new visitor centre.[80][81] In 2019, to address overtourism, the site instituted fines for visitors who stayed longer than three hours.[82]\n\n\nThe small town to the south of the Taj, known as Taj Ganji or Mumtazabad, was initially constructed with caravanserais, bazaars and markets to serve the needs of visitors and workers.[83] Lists of recommended travel destinations often feature the Taj Mahal, which also appears in several listings of seven wonders of the modern world, including the recently announced New Seven Wonders of the World, a recent poll with 100 million votes.[84]\n\n\nThe grounds are open from 06:00 to 19:00 hours on weekdays, except on Friday when the complex is open for prayers at the mosque between 12:00 and 14:00 hours. The complex is open for night viewing on the day of the full moon and two days before and after,[85] excluding Fridays and the month of Ramadan.\n\n\nForeign dignitaries often visit the Taj Mahal on trips to India. Notable figures who have travelled to the site include Dwight Eisenhower, Jacqueline Kennedy, Jimmy Carter, George H. W. Bush, George Harrison, Vladimir Putin, Princess Diana, Donald Trump, Justin Trudeau, Prince Charles, Queen Elizabeth, and Prince Philip.[86][87][88][89]\n\n\n\n## Myths[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jean-Baptiste Tavernier, one of the first European writers about the Taj Mahal\nEver since its construction, the building has been the source of an admiration transcending culture and geography, and so personal and emotional responses have consistently eclipsed scholastic appraisals of the monument.[90] A longstanding myth holds that Shah Jahan planned a mausoleum to be built in black marble as a Black Taj Mahal across the Yamuna river.[14] The idea originates from fanciful writings of Jean-Baptiste Tavernier, a European traveller who visited Agra in 1665. It was suggested that his son Aurangzeb overthrew Shah Jahan before it could be built. Ruins of blackened marble across the river in the Mehtab Bagh, seemed to support this legend. However, excavations carried out in the 1990s found that they were discoloured white stones that had turned black.[91] A more credible theory for the origins of the black mausoleum was demonstrated in 2006 by archaeologists who reconstructed part of the pool in the Mehtab Bagh. A dark reflection of the white mausoleum could clearly be seen, befitting Shah Jahan's obsession with symmetry and the positioning of the pool itself.[92]\n\n\nNo concrete evidence exists for claims that describe, often in horrific detail, the deaths, dismemberments and mutilations which Shah Jahan supposedly inflicted on various architects and craftsmen associated with the tomb.[93][94] Some stories claim that those involved in construction signed contracts committing themselves to have no part in any similar design. Similar claims are made for many famous buildings.[95] No evidence exists for claims that Lord William Bentinck, governor-general of India in the 1830s, supposedly planned to demolish the Taj Mahal and auction off the marble. Bentinck's biographer John Rosselli says that the story arose from Bentinck's fund-raising sale of discarded marble from Agra Fort.[96]\n\n\nAnother myth suggests that beating the silhouette of the finial will cause water to come forth. To this day, officials find broken bangles surrounding the silhouette.[97]\n\n\nSeveral myths, none of which are supported by the archaeological record, have appeared asserting that people other than Shah Jahan and the original architects were responsible for the construction of the Taj Mahal. For instance, in 2000, India's Supreme Court dismissed P. N. Oak's petition[98] to declare that a Hindu king built the Taj Mahal.[95][99] In 2005, a similar petition was dismissed by the Allahabad High Court. This case was brought by Amar Nath Mishra, a social worker and preacher who claimed that the Taj Mahal was built by the Hindu King Parmal Dev in 1196.[100]\n\n\nAnother such unsupported theory is that the Taj Mahal was designed by an Italian, Geronimo Vereneo, held sway for a brief period after it was first promoted by Henry George Keene in 1879 who went by a translation of a Spanish work *Itinerario*, (*The Travels of Fray Sebastian Manrique, 1629–1643*). Another theory that a Frenchman, Austin of Bordeaux designed the Taj was promoted by William Henry Sleeman based on the work of Jean-Baptiste Tavernier. These ideas were revived by Father Hosten and discussed again by E.B. Havell and served as the basis for subsequent theories and controversies.[101]\n\n\nAs of 2017, several court cases about Taj Mahal being a Hindu temple have been inspired by P. N. Oak's theory.[102][103] In August 2017, Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) stated there was no evidence to suggest the monument ever housed a temple.[104] Bharatiya Janata Party's Vinay Katiyar in 2017 claimed that the 17th century monument was built by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan after destroying a Hindu temple called \"Tejo Mahalaya\" and it housed a Shiva linga. This claim had also been made by another BJP member Laxmikant Bajpai in 2014. The BJP government's Union Minister of Culture Mahesh Sharma stated in November 2015 during a session of the parliament, that there was no evidence that it was a temple. The theories about Taj Mahal being a Shiva temple started circulating when Oak released his 1989 book *Taj Mahal: The True Story*. He claimed it was built in 1155 AD and not in the 17th century, as stated by the ASI.[105]\n\n\n\n## Gallery[edit]\n\n\n* Taj Mahal\n* ![Eastern view in the morning](image)\n\nEastern view in the morning\n* ![Taj Mahal in cloudy weather and its minaret under restoration](image)\n\nTaj Mahal in cloudy weather and its minaret under restoration\n* ![Western view at sunset](image)\n\nWestern view at sunset\n* ![Taj Mahal through the fog](image)\n\nTaj Mahal through the fog\n* ![A panoramic view looking 360 degrees around the Taj Mahal in 2005](image)\n\nA panoramic view looking 360 degrees around the Taj Mahal in 2005\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)India portal\n* ![](image)Islam portal\n* ![icon](image)Architecture portal\n\n\n* Architecture of India\n* Bibi Ka Maqbara, a similar building in the Deccan, Aurangabad\n* Fatehpur Sikri, a nearby city and World Heritage Site\n* Islamic architecture\n* Indo-Islamic architecture\n* *Inside*, a 1968 new-age music album recorded in the building\n* List of tallest domes\n* List of tallest structures built before the 20th century\n* New 7 Wonders of the World\n* Taj Mahal replicas and derivatives\n* Wonders of the World\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Taj Mahal\". *UNESCO Culture World Heritage Centre, World Heritage List*.

The first through 85th floors contain 2.158 million square feet (200,500 m2) of commercial and office space, while the 86th floor contains an observatory.[33][31][34] The remaining 16 stories are part of the spire, which is capped by an observatory on the 102nd floor; the spire does not contain any intermediate levels and is used mostly for mechanical purposes.[31] Atop the 102nd story is the 203 ft (61.9 m) pinnacle, much of which is covered by broadcast antennas, and surmounted with a lightning rod.[35]\n\n\n\n### Form[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n340. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Egan, Matt (August 24, 2016). \"Qatar buys chunk of Empire State Building\". *CNNMoney*.

Chappell called the mast \"a silly gesture\", and Lewis Mumford called it \"a public comfort station for migratory birds\".[36] Nevertheless, architecture critic Douglas Haskell said the Empire State Building's appeal came from the fact that it was \"caught at the exact moment of transition—caught between metal and stone, between the idea of 'monumental mass' and that of airy volume, between handicraft and machine design, and in the swing from what was essentially handicraft to what will be essentially industrial methods of fabrication.\"[424]\n\n\n\n### As icon[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nTimeline of tallest buildings in New York City\n |\n| --- |\n| * Collegiate Reformed Protestant Dutch Church (c. 1643)\n* Trinity Church (85 m) (1846)\n* New York World Building (94 m) (1890)\n* Manhattan Life Insurance Building (100 m) (1894)\n* Park Row Building (119 m) (1899)\n* Singer Building (187 m) (1908)\n* Metropolitan Life Tower (213 m) (1909)\n* Woolworth Building (241 m) (1913)\n* 40 Wall Street (283 m) (1930)\n* Chrysler Building (320 m) (1930)\n* Empire State Building (443 m) (1931)\n* World Trade Center (526 m) (1973)\n* Empire State Building (443 m) (2001)\n* One World Trade Center (541 m) (2014)\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nSupertall skyscrapers (300 m/984 ft and taller)\n |\n| --- |\n| \n\n| Completed\n |\n| --- |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n| Americas\n |\n| --- |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n46. **^** \"Zoning Districts & Tools : C6 - DCP\". *www1.nyc.gov*.\n47. **^** Willis, Carol (1992).

Some of the levels were still undergoing final approval, with several orders placed within an hour of a plan being finalized.[221] On September 10, as steelwork was nearing completion, Smith laid the building's cornerstone during a ceremony attended by thousands.

The first through 85th floors contain 2.158 million square feet (200,500 m2) of commercial and office space, while the 86th floor contains an observatory.[33][31][34] The remaining 16 stories are part of the spire, which is capped by an observatory on the 102nd floor; the spire does not contain any intermediate levels and is used mostly for mechanical purposes.[31] Atop the 102nd story is the 203 ft (61.9 m) pinnacle, much of which is covered by broadcast antennas, and surmounted with a lightning rod.[35]\n\n\n\n### Form[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n340. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Egan, Matt (August 24, 2016). \"Qatar buys chunk of Empire State Building\". *CNNMoney*.

Chappell called the mast \"a silly gesture\", and Lewis Mumford called it \"a public comfort station for migratory birds\".[36] Nevertheless, architecture critic Douglas Haskell said the Empire State Building's appeal came from the fact that it was \"caught at the exact moment of transition—caught between metal and stone, between the idea of 'monumental mass' and that of airy volume, between handicraft and machine design, and in the swing from what was essentially handicraft to what will be essentially industrial methods of fabrication.\"[424]\n\n\n\n### As icon[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nTimeline of tallest buildings in New York City\n |\n| --- |\n| * Collegiate Reformed Protestant Dutch Church (c. 1643)\n* Trinity Church (85 m) (1846)\n* New York World Building (94 m) (1890)\n* Manhattan Life Insurance Building (100 m) (1894)\n* Park Row Building (119 m) (1899)\n* Singer Building (187 m) (1908)\n* Metropolitan Life Tower (213 m) (1909)\n* Woolworth Building (241 m) (1913)\n* 40 Wall Street (283 m) (1930)\n* Chrysler Building (320 m) (1930)\n* Empire State Building (443 m) (1931)\n* World Trade Center (526 m) (1973)\n* Empire State Building (443 m) (2001)\n* One World Trade Center (541 m) (2014)\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nSupertall skyscrapers (300 m/984 ft and taller)\n |\n| --- |\n| \n\n| Completed\n |\n| --- |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n| Americas\n |\n| --- |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n46. **^** \"Zoning Districts & Tools : C6 - DCP\". *www1.nyc.gov*.\n47. **^** Willis, Carol (1992).

Its articulation consists of three horizontal sections similar to the components of a column, namely a base, shaft, and capital.[33] The five-story base occupies the entire lot, while the 81-story shaft above it is set back sharply from the base.[36][37][38] The setback above the 5th story is 60 feet (18 m) deep on all sides.[33] There are smaller setbacks on the upper stories, allowing sunlight to illuminate the interiors of the top floors while also positioning these floors away from the noisy streets below.[39][40] The setbacks are located at the 21st, 25th, 30th, 72nd, 81st, and 85th stories.[41] The setbacks correspond to the tops of elevator shafts, allowing interior spaces to be at most 28 feet (8.5 m) deep (see § Interior).[33]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n\t* Landmarks Preservation Commission 1981, p. 17.\n\t* Willis 1995, p. 90.\n\t* Willis & Friedman 1998, p. 48.\n\t* Schleier, Merrill (1990). *The skyscraper in American art, 1890-1931*.

The building has a roof height of 1,250 feet (380 m) and stands a total of 1,454 feet (443.2 m) tall, including its antenna.

As of 2022[update], the building is the seventh-tallest building in New York City, the ninth-tallest completed skyscraper in the United States, the 54th-tallest in the world, and the sixth-tallest freestanding structure in the Americas.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Early skyscrapers\n* NTT Docomo Yoyogi Building\n* List of buildings with 100 floors or more\n* List of National Historic Landmarks in New York City\n* List of New York City Designated Landmarks in Manhattan from 14th to 59th Streets\n* List of tallest buildings by U.S. state\n* List of tallest freestanding steel structures\n* National Register of Historic Places listings in Manhattan from 14th to 59th Streets\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Notes[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n182. **^** \"Enlarges Site For 1,000-foot Building; Empire State Adds 75 Feet in 33d Street to the Waldorf Hotel Plot\" (PDF). *The New York Times*.

Some of the levels were still undergoing final approval, with several orders placed within an hour of a plan being finalized.[221] On September 10, as steelwork was nearing completion, Smith laid the building's cornerstone during a ceremony attended by thousands.

The most important buildings visible on the Acropolis today – the Parthenon, the Propylaia, the Erechtheion and the temple of Athena Nike – were erected during this period. The Parthenon was built under the general supervision of Phidias, who also had charge of the sculptural decoration. The architects Ictinos and Callicrates began their work in 447, and the building was substantially completed by 432. Work on the decorations continued until at least 431.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nAcropolis of Athens\n |\n| --- |\n| Extant structures | * Parthenon\n* Erechtheion\n* Propylaia\n* Temple of Athena Nike\n* Odeon of Herodes Atticus\n* Pedestal of Agrippa\n* Stoa of Eumenes\n* Sanctuary of Asclepius\n* Theatre of Dionysus Eleuthereus\n* Aglaureion\n* Choragic Monument of Thrasyllos\n* Beulé Gate\n* Cave Sanctuaries\n* Peripatos\n* Infrastructure\n | ![](image)\n |\n| Former structures | * Pelasgic wall\n* Hekatompedon temple\n* Older Parthenon\n* Old Temple of Athena\n* Sanctuary of Artemis Brauronia\n* Chalkotheke\n* Pandroseion\n* Arrephorion\n* Altar of Athena Polias\n* Eleusinion\n* Sanctuary of Pandion\n* Sanctuary of Zeus Polieus\n* Odeon of Pericles\n* Frankish Tower\n* Choragic Monument of Nikias\n* Klepsydra\n* Church of Panagia Atheniotissa\n* Temple of Roma and Augustus\n* Parthenon mosque\n |\n| People | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n65. **^** Senseney, John R.

John Julius Cooper wrote that \"even in antiquity, its architectural refinements were legendary, especially the subtle correspondence between the curvature of the stylobate, the taper of the naos walls, and the entasis of the columns\".[68] Entasis refers to the slight swelling, of 4 centimetres (1.6 in), in the center of the columns to counteract the appearance of columns having a waist, as the swelling makes them look straight from a distance. The stylobate is the platform on which the columns stand. As in many other classical Greek temples,[69] it has a slight parabolic upward curvature intended to shed rainwater and reinforce the building against earthquakes. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Floor plan of the Parthenon\nThe Parthenon is a peripteral octastyle Doric temple with Ionic architectural features. It stands on a platform or stylobate of three steps. In common with other Greek temples, it is of post and lintel construction and is surrounded by columns ('peripteral') carrying an entablature. There are eight columns at either end ('octastyle') and seventeen on the sides. There is a double row of columns at either end. The colonnade surrounds an inner masonry structure, the *cella,* which is divided into two compartments. The *opisthodomos* (the back room of the cella) contained the monetary contributions of the Delian League. At either end of the building, the gable is finished with a triangular pediment originally occupied by sculpted figures.[63]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe **Parthenon** (/ˈpɑːrθəˌnɒn, -nən/; Ancient Greek: Παρθενών, romanized: **Parthenōn** [par.tʰe.nɔ̌ːn]; Greek: Παρθενώνας, romanized: *Parthenónas* [parθeˈnonas]) is a former temple[6][7] on the Athenian Acropolis, Greece, that was dedicated to the goddess Athena during the fifth century BC. Its decorative sculptures are considered some of the high points of classical Greek art, an enduring symbol of Ancient Greece, democracy and Western civilization.[8][9]\n\n\nThe Parthenon was built in thanksgiving for the Hellenic victory over Persian Empire invaders during the Greco-Persian Wars.[10] Like most Greek temples, the Parthenon also served as the city treasury.[11][12]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nTemple on the Athenian Acropolis, Greece\n\n\"Temple of Athena\" redirects here.

That group of interdisciplinary specialist scholars oversees the academic understanding of the site to guide restoration efforts.[139] The project later attracted funding and technical assistance from the European Union. An archaeological committee thoroughly documented every artefact remaining on the site, and architects assisted with computer models to determine their original locations. Particularly important and fragile sculptures were transferred to the Acropolis Museum.\n\n\nA crane was installed for moving marble blocks; the crane was designed to fold away beneath the roofline when not in use.[140] In some cases, prior re-constructions were found to be incorrect. These were dismantled, and a careful process of restoration began.[141]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe rediscovery of the Parthenon as an ancient monument dates back to the period of Humanism; Cyriacus of Ancona was the first after antiquity to describe the Parthenon, of which he had read many times in ancient texts. Thanks to him, Western Europe was able to have the first design of the monument, which Ciriaco called \"temple of the goddess Athena\", unlike previous travellers, who had called it \"church of Virgin Mary\":[112]\n\n\n*...mirabile Palladis Divae marmoreum templum, divum quippe opus Phidiae* (\"...the wonderful temple of the goddess Athena, a divine work of Phidias\").\n\n\n\n### Islamic mosque[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSome studies of the Acropolis, including of the Parthenon and its facade, have conjectured that many of its proportions approximate the golden ratio.[74] More recent studies have shown that the proportions of the Parthenon do not match the golden proportion.[75][76]\n\n\n\n## Sculpture[edit]\n\n\n\"Parthenon Marbles\" redirects here.

The appearance of this is known from other images. The decorative stonework was originally highly coloured.[77] The temple was dedicated to Athena at that time, though construction continued until almost the beginning of the Peloponnesian War in 432. By the year 438, the Doric metopes on the frieze above the exterior colonnade and the Ionic frieze around the upper portion of the walls of the cella had been completed.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n72. **^** Archaeologists discuss similarly curved architecture and offer the theory. *Nova*, \"Secrets of the Parthenon\", PBS. http://video.yahoo.com/watch/1849622/6070405[*permanent dead link*]\n73. **^** Hadingham, Evan (February 2008), *Unlocking Mysteries of the Parthenon*, Washington, DC: Smithsonian Magazine, p. 42\n74. **^** Van Mersbergen, Audrey M., \"Rhetorical Prototypes in Architecture: Measuring the Acropolis\", *Philosophical Polemic Communication Quarterly*, Vol. 46, 1998.\n75. **^** George Markowsky (January 1992). \"Misconceptions about the Golden Ratio\" (PDF). *The College Mathematics Journal*. **23** (1).

It was completed in 438 BC; work on the decoration continued until 432 BC. For a time, it served as the treasury of the Delian League, which later became the Athenian Empire. In the final decade of the 6th century AD, the Parthenon was converted into a Christian church dedicated to the Virgin Mary. After the Ottoman conquest in the mid-fifteenth century, it became a mosque. In the Morean War, a Venetian bomb landed on the Parthenon, which the Ottomans had used as a munitions dump, during the 1687 siege of the Acropolis. The resulting explosion severely damaged the Parthenon. From 1800 to 1803,[13] the 7th Earl of Elgin took down some of the surviving sculptures, now known as the Elgin Marbles, in an act widely considered, both in its time and subsequently, to constitute vandalism and looting.[14]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n116. **^** D'Ooge, Martin Luther (1909). *The acropolis of Athens*.

Above the architrave of the entablature is a frieze of carved pictorial panels (metopes), separated by formal architectural triglyphs, also typical of the Doric order. The continuous frieze in low relief around the cella and across the lintels of the inner columns, in contrast, reflects the Ionic order. Architectural historian John R. Senseney suggests that this unexpected switch between orders was due to an aesthetic choice on the part of builders during construction, and was likely not part of the original plan of the Parthenon.[65]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n120. **^** D'Ooge, Martin Luther (1909). *The acropolis of Athens*.

Unskilled labourers also had key roles in the building of the Parthenon. They loaded and unloaded the marble blocks and moved the blocks from place to place. In order to complete a project like the Parthenon, many different labourers were needed.[62]\n\n\n\n## Architecture[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn March 2011, archaeologists announced that they had discovered five metopes of the Parthenon in the south wall of the Acropolis, which had been extended when the Acropolis was used as a fortress. According to *Eleftherotypia* daily, the archaeologists claimed the metopes had been placed there in the 18th century when the Acropolis wall was being repaired. The experts discovered the metopes while processing 2,250 photos with modern photographic methods, as the white Pentelic marble they are made of differed from the other stone of the wall. It was previously presumed that the missing metopes were destroyed during the Morosini explosion of the Parthenon in 1687.[84]\n\n\n\n### Frieze[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Parthenon Frieze\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Parthenon was built primarily by men who knew how to work marble. These quarrymen had exceptional skills and were able to cut the blocks of marble to very specific measurements. The quarrymen also knew how to avoid the faults, which were numerous in the Pentelic marble. If the marble blocks were not up to standard, the architects would reject them. The marble was worked with iron tools – picks, points, punches, chisels, and drills. The quarrymen would hold their tools against the marble block and firmly tap the surface of the rock.[62]\n\n\nA big project like the Parthenon attracted stonemasons from far and wide who travelled to Athens to assist in the project. Slaves and foreigners worked together with the Athenian citizens in the building of the Parthenon, doing the same jobs for the same pay. Temple building was a specialized craft, and there were not many men in Greece qualified to build temples like the Parthenon, so these men would travel and work where they were needed.[62]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n126. **^** Theodor E.

The cult image of Athena Polias, which was bathed in the sea and to which was presented the *peplos*, was an olive-wood *xoanon*, located in another temple on the northern side of the Acropolis, more closely associated with the Great Altar of Athena.[31] The High Priestess of Athena Polias supervised the city cult of Athena based in the Akropolis, and was the chief of the lesser officials, such as the plyntrides, arrephoroi and kanephoroi.[32]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe existence of both the proto-Parthenon and its destruction were known from Herodotus,[53] and the drums of its columns were visibly built into the curtain wall north of the Erechtheion. Further physical evidence of this structure was revealed with the excavations of Panagiotis Kavvadias of 1885–1890. The findings of this dig allowed Wilhelm Dörpfeld, then director of the German Archaeological Institute, to assert that there existed a distinct substructure to the original Parthenon, called Parthenon I by Dörpfeld, not immediately below the present edifice as previously assumed.[54] Dörpfeld's observation was that the three steps of the first Parthenon consisted of two steps of Poros limestone, the same as the foundations, and a top step of Karrha limestone that was covered by the lowest step of the Periclean Parthenon. This platform was smaller and slightly to the north of the final Parthenon, indicating that it was built for a different building, now completely covered over. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n132. **^** Carr, Gerald L.

One argument involves the oath sworn by the Greek allies before the Battle of Plataea in 479 BC[56] declaring that the sanctuaries destroyed by the Persians would not be rebuilt, an oath from which the Athenians were only absolved with the Peace of Callias in 450.[57] The cost of reconstructing Athens after the Persian sack is at least as likely a cause. The excavations of Bert Hodge Hill led him to propose the existence of a second Parthenon, begun in the period of Kimon after 468.[58] Hill claimed that the Karrha limestone step Dörpfeld thought was the highest of Parthenon I was the lowest of the three steps of Parthenon II, whose stylobate dimensions Hill calculated at 23.51 by 66.888 metres (77.13 ft × 219.45 ft).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)The Parthenon's position on the Acropolis dominates the city skyline of Athens.\nA major fire broke out in the Parthenon shortly after the middle of the third century AD.[98][99] which destroyed the roof and much of the sanctuary's interior.[100] Heruli pirates sacked Athens in 276, and destroyed most of the public buildings there, including the Parthenon.[101] Repairs were made in the fourth century AD, possibly during the reign of Julian the Apostate.[102] A new wooden roof overlaid with clay tiles was installed to cover the sanctuary.

This building replaced a Hekatompedon temple (\"hundred-footer\") and would have stood beside the archaic temple dedicated to *Athena Polias* (\"of the city\"). The Older or Pre-Parthenon, as it is frequently referred to, was still under construction when the Persians sacked the city in 480 BC razing the Acropolis.[51][52]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOne difficulty in dating the proto-Parthenon is that at the time of the 1885 excavation, the archaeological method of seriation was not fully developed; the careless digging and refilling of the site led to a loss of much valuable information. An attempt to make sense of the potsherds found on the Acropolis came with the two-volume study by Graef and Langlotz published in 1925–1933.[59] This inspired American archaeologist William Bell Dinsmoor to give limiting dates for the temple platform and the five walls hidden under the re-terracing of the Acropolis. Dinsmoor concluded that the latest possible date for Parthenon I was no earlier than 495 BC, contradicting the early date given by Dörpfeld.[60] He denied that there were two proto-Parthenons, and held that the only pre-Periclean temple was what Dörpfeld referred to as Parthenon II. Dinsmoor and Dörpfeld exchanged views in the *American Journal of Archaeology* in 1935.[61]\n\n\n\n### Present building[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n139. **^** \"Acropolis Restoration Service\". *YSMA*.

They may serve as a sort of \"reverse optical illusion\".[72] As the Greeks may have been aware, two parallel lines appear to bow, or curve outward, when intersected by converging lines. In this case, the ceiling and floor of the temple may seem to bow in the presence of the surrounding angles of the building. Striving for perfection, the designers may have added these curves, compensating for the illusion by creating their own curves, thus negating this effect and allowing the temple to be seen as they intended. It is also suggested that it was to enliven what might have appeared an inert mass in the case of a building without curves.

It is suggested to have occurred in c. 481–484, on the order of Emperor Zeno, because the temple had been the focus of Pagan Hellenic opposition against Zeno in Athens in support of Illus, who had promised to restore Hellenic rites to the temples that were still standing.[104]\n\n\nAt some point in the fifth century, Athena's great cult image was looted by one of the emperors and taken to Constantinople, where it was later destroyed, possibly during the siege and sack of Constantinople during the Fourth Crusade in 1204 AD.[105]\n\n\n\n### Christian church[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * Funeral and burial practices\n* Mythology\n\t+ mythological figures\n* Temple\n* Twelve Olympians\n* Underworld\n* Greco-Buddhism\n* Greco-Buddhist monasticism\n |\n| Sacred places | * Eleusis\n* Delphi\n* Delos\n* Dion\n* Dodona\n* Mount Olympus\n* Olympia\n |\n\n |\n| Structures | \n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * Athenian Treasury\n* Lion Gate\n* Long Walls\n* Philippeion\n* Theatre of Dionysus\n* Tunnel of Eupalinos\n |\n| Temples | * Aphaea\n* Artemis\n* Athena Nike\n* Erechtheion\n* Hephaestus\n* Hera, Olympia\n* Parthenon\n* Samothrace\n* Zeus, Olympia\n |\n\n |\n| Language | * Proto-Greek\n* Mycenaean\n* Homeric\n* Dialects\n\t+ Aeolic\n\t+ Arcadocypriot\n\t+ Attic\n\t+ Doric\n\t+ Epirote\n\t+ Ionic\n\t+ Locrian\n\t+ Macedonian\n\t+ Pamphylian\n* Koine\n |\n| Writing | * Linear A\n* Linear B\n* Cypriot syllabary\n* Greek alphabet\n* Greek numerals\n* Attic numerals\n |\n\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n| * Greek colonisation\n |\n| --- |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Magna Graecia | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMeasured at the stylobate, the dimensions of the base of the Parthenon are 69.5 by 30.9 metres (228 by 101 ft). The cella was 29.8 metres long by 19.2 metres wide (97.8 × 63.0 ft). On the exterior, the Doric columns measure 1.9 metres (6.2 ft) in diameter and are 10.4 metres (34 ft) high. The corner columns are slightly larger in diameter. The Parthenon had 46 outer columns and 23 inner columns in total, each column having 20 flutes. (A flute is the concave shaft carved into the column form.) The roof was covered with large overlapping marble tiles known as imbrices and tegulae.[66][67]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nGreen claims that the Parthenon was the room where the *arrephoroi*, a group of four young girls chosen to serve Athena each year, wove a peplos that was presented to Athena during Panathenaic Festivals.[18] Christopher Pelling asserts that the name \"Parthenon\" means the \"temple of the virgin goddess\", referring to the cult of Athena Parthenos that was associated with the temple.[19] It has also been suggested that the name of the temple alludes to the maidens (*parthénoi*), whose supreme sacrifice guaranteed the safety of the city.[20] In that case, the room originally known as the Parthenon could have been a part of the temple known today as the Erechtheion.[21]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe frieze of the Parthenon's entablature contained 92 metopes, 14 each on the east and west sides, 32 each on the north and south sides. They were carved in high relief, a practice employed until then only in treasuries (buildings used to keep votive gifts to the gods).[80] According to the building records, the metope sculptures date to the years 446–440. The metopes of the east side of the Parthenon, above the main entrance, depict the Gigantomachy (the mythical battle between the Olympian gods and the Giants). The metopes of the west end show the Amazonomachy (the mythical battle of the Athenians against the Amazons). The metopes of the south side show the Thessalian Centauromachy (battle of the Lapiths aided by Theseus against the half-man, half-horse Centaurs). \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBecause the Parthenon was dedicated to the Greek goddess Athena it has sometimes been referred to as the Temple of Minerva, the Roman name for Athena, particularly during the 19th century.[28]\n\n\n*Parthénos* was also applied to the Virgin Mary (*Parthénos Maria*) when the Parthenon was converted to a Christian church dedicated to the Virgin Mary in the final decade of the 6th century.[29]\n\n\n\n## Function[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe east pediment originally contained 10 to 12 sculptures depicting the Birth of Athena. Most of those pieces were removed and lost during renovations in either the eighth or the twelfth century.[90] Only two corners remain today with figures depicting the passage of time over the course of a full day. Tethrippa of Helios is in the left corner and Selene is on the right. The horses of Helios's chariot are shown with livid expressions as they ascend into the sky at the start of the day. Selene's horses struggle to stay on the pediment scene as the day comes to an end.[91][92]\n\n\n\n#### West pediment[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Timocreon\n* Tyrtaeus\n* Xenophon\n |\n| Others | * Athenian statesmen\n* Lawgivers\n* Olympic victors\n* Tyrants\n |\n| By culture | * Ancient Greek tribes\n* Thracian Greeks\n* Ancient Macedonians\n |\n\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n| * Society\n* Culture\n |\n| --- |\n| \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Society | * Agriculture\n* Calendar\n* Clothing\n* Coinage\n* Cuisine\n* Economy\n* Education\n* Emporium\n* Euergetism\n* Festivals\n* Folklore\n* Homosexuality\n* Law\n* Olympic Games\n* Pederasty\n* Philosophy\n* Prostitution\n* Religion\n* Slavery\n* Warfare\n* Wedding customs\n* Wine\n |\n| Arts and science | * Architecture\n\t+ Greek Revival architecture\n* Astronomy\n* Literature\n* Mathematics\n* Medicine\n* Music\n\t+ Musical system\n* Pottery\n* Sculpture\n* Technology\n* Theatre\n* Greco-Buddhist art\n |\n| Religion | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe supporters of Athena are extensively illustrated at the back of the left chariot, while the defenders of Poseidon are shown trailing behind the right chariot. It is believed that the corners of the pediment are filled by Athenian water deities, such as the Kephisos river, the Ilissos river, and nymph Kallirhoe. This belief emerges from the fluid character of the sculptures' body position which represents the effort of the artist to give the impression of a flowing river.[93][94] Next to the left river god, there are the sculptures of the mythical king of Athens (Cecrops or Kekrops) with his daughters ( Aglaurus, Pandrosos, Herse). The statue of Poseidon was the largest sculpture in the pediment until it broke into pieces during Francesco Morosini's effort to remove it in 1688. The posterior piece of the torso was found by Lusieri in the groundwork of a Turkish house in 1801 and is currently held in the British Museum. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMetopes 13–21 are missing, but drawings from 1674 attributed to Jaques Carrey indicate a series of humans; these have been variously interpreted as scenes from the Lapith wedding, scenes from the early history of Athens, and various myths.[81] On the north side of the Parthenon, the metopes are poorly preserved, but the subject seems to be the sack of Troy.[9]\n\n\nThe mythological figures of the metopes of the East, North, and West sides of the Parthenon had been deliberately mutilated by Christian iconoclasts in late antiquity.[82]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThis picture was somewhat complicated by the publication of the final report on the 1885–1890 excavations, indicating that the substructure was contemporary with the Kimonian walls, and implying a later date for the first temple.[55]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn December 2022, the British newspaper *The Guardian* published a story with quotes from Greek government officials that suggested negotiations to return the marbles were underway and a \"credible\" solution was being discussed.[137]\n\n\nFour pieces of the sculptures have been repatriated to Greece: 3 from the Vatican, and 1 from a museum in Sicily.[138]\n\n\n\n## Restoration[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"1d991798-432c-4413-9f52-21078c9a07df","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

The most important buildings visible on the Acropolis today – the Parthenon, the Propylaia, the Erechtheion and the temple of Athena Nike – were erected during this period. The Parthenon was built under the general supervision of Phidias, who also had charge of the sculptural decoration. The architects Ictinos and Callicrates began their work in 447, and the building was substantially completed by 432. Work on the decorations continued until at least 431.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nAcropolis of Athens\n |\n| --- |\n| Extant structures | * Parthenon\n* Erechtheion\n* Propylaia\n* Temple of Athena Nike\n* Odeon of Herodes Atticus\n* Pedestal of Agrippa\n* Stoa of Eumenes\n* Sanctuary of Asclepius\n* Theatre of Dionysus Eleuthereus\n* Aglaureion\n* Choragic Monument of Thrasyllos\n* Beulé Gate\n* Cave Sanctuaries\n* Peripatos\n* Infrastructure\n | ![](image)\n |\n| Former structures | * Pelasgic wall\n* Hekatompedon temple\n* Older Parthenon\n* Old Temple of Athena\n* Sanctuary of Artemis Brauronia\n* Chalkotheke\n* Pandroseion\n* Arrephorion\n* Altar of Athena Polias\n* Eleusinion\n* Sanctuary of Pandion\n* Sanctuary of Zeus Polieus\n* Odeon of Pericles\n* Frankish Tower\n* Choragic Monument of Nikias\n* Klepsydra\n* Church of Panagia Atheniotissa\n* Temple of Roma and Augustus\n* Parthenon mosque\n |\n| People | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n65. **^** Senseney, John R.

John Julius Cooper wrote that \"even in antiquity, its architectural refinements were legendary, especially the subtle correspondence between the curvature of the stylobate, the taper of the naos walls, and the entasis of the columns\".[68] Entasis refers to the slight swelling, of 4 centimetres (1.6 in), in the center of the columns to counteract the appearance of columns having a waist, as the swelling makes them look straight from a distance. The stylobate is the platform on which the columns stand. As in many other classical Greek temples,[69] it has a slight parabolic upward curvature intended to shed rainwater and reinforce the building against earthquakes. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Floor plan of the Parthenon\nThe Parthenon is a peripteral octastyle Doric temple with Ionic architectural features. It stands on a platform or stylobate of three steps. In common with other Greek temples, it is of post and lintel construction and is surrounded by columns ('peripteral') carrying an entablature. There are eight columns at either end ('octastyle') and seventeen on the sides. There is a double row of columns at either end. The colonnade surrounds an inner masonry structure, the *cella,* which is divided into two compartments. The *opisthodomos* (the back room of the cella) contained the monetary contributions of the Delian League. At either end of the building, the gable is finished with a triangular pediment originally occupied by sculpted figures.[63]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe **Parthenon** (/ˈpɑːrθəˌnɒn, -nən/; Ancient Greek: Παρθενών, romanized: **Parthenōn** [par.tʰe.nɔ̌ːn]; Greek: Παρθενώνας, romanized: *Parthenónas* [parθeˈnonas]) is a former temple[6][7] on the Athenian Acropolis, Greece, that was dedicated to the goddess Athena during the fifth century BC. Its decorative sculptures are considered some of the high points of classical Greek art, an enduring symbol of Ancient Greece, democracy and Western civilization.[8][9]\n\n\nThe Parthenon was built in thanksgiving for the Hellenic victory over Persian Empire invaders during the Greco-Persian Wars.[10] Like most Greek temples, the Parthenon also served as the city treasury.[11][12]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nTemple on the Athenian Acropolis, Greece\n\n\"Temple of Athena\" redirects here.

That group of interdisciplinary specialist scholars oversees the academic understanding of the site to guide restoration efforts.[139] The project later attracted funding and technical assistance from the European Union. An archaeological committee thoroughly documented every artefact remaining on the site, and architects assisted with computer models to determine their original locations.

The appearance of this is known from other images. The decorative stonework was originally highly coloured.[77] The temple was dedicated to Athena at that time, though construction continued until almost the beginning of the Peloponnesian War in 432.

It was completed in 438 BC; work on the decoration continued until 432 BC. For a time, it served as the treasury of the Delian League, which later became the Athenian Empire. In the final decade of the 6th century AD, the Parthenon was converted into a Christian church dedicated to the Virgin Mary. After the Ottoman conquest in the mid-fifteenth century, it became a mosque. In the Morean War, a Venetian bomb landed on the Parthenon, which the Ottomans had used as a munitions dump, during the 1687 siege of the Acropolis. The resulting explosion severely damaged the Parthenon. From 1800 to 1803,[13] the 7th Earl of Elgin took down some of the surviving sculptures, now known as the Elgin Marbles, in an act widely considered, both in its time and subsequently, to constitute vandalism and looting.[14]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n116. **^** D'Ooge, Martin Luther (1909). *The acropolis of Athens*.

Above the architrave of the entablature is a frieze of carved pictorial panels (metopes), separated by formal architectural triglyphs, also typical of the Doric order. The continuous frieze in low relief around the cella and across the lintels of the inner columns, in contrast, reflects the Ionic order. Architectural historian John R. Senseney suggests that this unexpected switch between orders was due to an aesthetic choice on the part of builders during construction, and was likely not part of the original plan of the Parthenon.[65]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n120. **^** D'Ooge, Martin Luther (1909). *The acropolis of Athens*.

Unskilled labourers also had key roles in the building of the Parthenon. They loaded and unloaded the marble blocks and moved the blocks from place to place. In order to complete a project like the Parthenon, many different labourers were needed.[62]\n\n\n\n## Architecture[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn March 2011, archaeologists announced that they had discovered five metopes of the Parthenon in the south wall of the Acropolis, which had been extended when the Acropolis was used as a fortress. According to *Eleftherotypia* daily, the archaeologists claimed the metopes had been placed there in the 18th century when the Acropolis wall was being repaired. The experts discovered the metopes while processing 2,250 photos with modern photographic methods, as the white Pentelic marble they are made of differed from the other stone of the wall. It was previously presumed that the missing metopes were destroyed during the Morosini explosion of the Parthenon in 1687.[84]\n\n\n\n### Frieze[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Parthenon Frieze\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Parthenon was built primarily by men who knew how to work marble. These quarrymen had exceptional skills and were able to cut the blocks of marble to very specific measurements. The quarrymen also knew how to avoid the faults, which were numerous in the Pentelic marble. If the marble blocks were not up to standard, the architects would reject them. The marble was worked with iron tools – picks, points, punches, chisels, and drills. The quarrymen would hold their tools against the marble block and firmly tap the surface of the rock.[62]\n\n\nA big project like the Parthenon attracted stonemasons from far and wide who travelled to Athens to assist in the project. Slaves and foreigners worked together with the Athenian citizens in the building of the Parthenon, doing the same jobs for the same pay. Temple building was a specialized craft, and there were not many men in Greece qualified to build temples like the Parthenon, so these men would travel and work where they were needed.[62]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n126. **^** Theodor E.

The cult image of Athena Polias, which was bathed in the sea and to which was presented the *peplos*, was an olive-wood *xoanon*, located in another temple on the northern side of the Acropolis, more closely associated with the Great Altar of Athena.[31] The High Priestess of Athena Polias supervised the city cult of Athena based in the Akropolis, and was the chief of the lesser officials, such as the plyntrides, arrephoroi and kanephoroi.[32]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe existence of both the proto-Parthenon and its destruction were known from Herodotus,[53] and the drums of its columns were visibly built into the curtain wall north of the Erechtheion. Further physical evidence of this structure was revealed with the excavations of Panagiotis Kavvadias of 1885–1890. The findings of this dig allowed Wilhelm Dörpfeld, then director of the German Archaeological Institute, to assert that there existed a distinct substructure to the original Parthenon, called Parthenon I by Dörpfeld, not immediately below the present edifice as previously assumed.[54] Dörpfeld's observation was that the three steps of the first Parthenon consisted of two steps of Poros limestone, the same as the foundations, and a top step of Karrha limestone that was covered by the lowest step of the Periclean Parthenon. This platform was smaller and slightly to the north of the final Parthenon, indicating that it was built for a different building, now completely covered over. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n132. **^** Carr, Gerald L.

One argument involves the oath sworn by the Greek allies before the Battle of Plataea in 479 BC[56] declaring that the sanctuaries destroyed by the Persians would not be rebuilt, an oath from which the Athenians were only absolved with the Peace of Callias in 450.[57] The cost of reconstructing Athens after the Persian sack is at least as likely a cause. The excavations of Bert Hodge Hill led him to propose the existence of a second Parthenon, begun in the period of Kimon after 468.[58] Hill claimed that the Karrha limestone step Dörpfeld thought was the highest of Parthenon I was the lowest of the three steps of Parthenon II, whose stylobate dimensions Hill calculated at 23.51 by 66.888 metres (77.13 ft × 219.45 ft).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)The Parthenon's position on the Acropolis dominates the city skyline of Athens.\nA major fire broke out in the Parthenon shortly after the middle of the third century AD.[98][99] which destroyed the roof and much of the sanctuary's interior.[100] Heruli pirates sacked Athens in 276, and destroyed most of the public buildings there, including the Parthenon.[101] Repairs were made in the fourth century AD, possibly during the reign of Julian the Apostate.[102] A new wooden roof overlaid with clay tiles was installed to cover the sanctuary. It sloped at a greater angle than the original roof and left the building's wings exposed.[100]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n78. **^** Sideris, Athanasios (1 January 2004). \"The Parthenon\". *Strolling Through Athens*: 112–119.\n79. **^** \"The Parthenon Frieze\".

The Greek government has campaigned since 1983 for the British Museum to return the sculptures to Greece.[134] The British Museum has consistently refused to return the sculptures,[135] and successive British governments have been unwilling to force the museum to do so (which would require legislation). Talks between senior representatives from Greek and British cultural ministries and their legal advisors took place in London on 4 May 2007. These were the first serious negotiations for several years, and there were hopes that the two sides might move a step closer to a resolution.[136]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * Themistocles\n* Pericles\n* Phidias\n* Ictinus\n* Callicrates\n* Mnesikles\n* Xerxes I\n* Mardonius\n* Francesco Morosini\n* Lord Elgin\n* Giovanni Battista Lusieri\n* Reverend Philip Hunt\n* Jacques Carrey\n* Louis-François-Sébastien Fauvel\n* Ludwig Ross\n* Kyriakos Pittakis\n* Panagiotis Kavvadias\n* Nikolaos Balanos\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n### Older Parthenon[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Older Parthenon\n\n![](image)The Older Parthenon (in black) was destroyed by the Achaemenids during the Destruction of Athens in 480–479 BC, and then rebuilt by Pericles (in grey).\nThe first endeavour to build a sanctuary for Athena Parthenos on the site of the present Parthenon was begun shortly after the Battle of Marathon (c. 490–488 BC) upon a solid limestone foundation that extended and levelled the southern part of the Acropolis summit. This building replaced a Hekatompedon temple (\"hundred-footer\") and would have stood beside the archaic temple dedicated to *Athena Polias* (\"of the city\"). The Older or Pre-Parthenon, as it is frequently referred to, was still under construction when the Persians sacked the city in 480 BC razing the Acropolis.[51][52]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOne difficulty in dating the proto-Parthenon is that at the time of the 1885 excavation, the archaeological method of seriation was not fully developed; the careless digging and refilling of the site led to a loss of much valuable information. An attempt to make sense of the potsherds found on the Acropolis came with the two-volume study by Graef and Langlotz published in 1925–1933.[59] This inspired American archaeologist William Bell Dinsmoor to give limiting dates for the temple platform and the five walls hidden under the re-terracing of the Acropolis. Dinsmoor concluded that the latest possible date for Parthenon I was no earlier than 495 BC, contradicting the early date given by Dörpfeld.[60] He denied that there were two proto-Parthenons, and held that the only pre-Periclean temple was what Dörpfeld referred to as Parthenon II. Dinsmoor and Dörpfeld exchanged views in the *American Journal of Archaeology* in 1935.[61]\n\n\n\n### Present building[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n139. **^** \"Acropolis Restoration Service\". *YSMA*.

They may serve as a sort of \"reverse optical illusion\".[72] As the Greeks may have been aware, two parallel lines appear to bow, or curve outward, when intersected by converging lines. In this case, the ceiling and floor of the temple may seem to bow in the presence of the surrounding angles of the building. Striving for perfection, the designers may have added these curves, compensating for the illusion by creating their own curves, thus negating this effect and allowing the temple to be seen as they intended. It is also suggested that it was to enliven what might have appeared an inert mass in the case of a building without curves.

Morosini was said to have responded by directing his artillery to aim at the Parthenon.[100][125] Subsequently, Morosini sought to loot sculptures from the ruin and caused further damage in the process.

It is suggested to have occurred in c. 481–484, on the order of Emperor Zeno, because the temple had been the focus of Pagan Hellenic opposition against Zeno in Athens in support of Illus, who had promised to restore Hellenic rites to the temples that were still standing.[104]\n\n\nAt some point in the fifth century, Athena's great cult image was looted by one of the emperors and taken to Constantinople, where it was later destroyed, possibly during the siege and sack of Constantinople during the Fourth Crusade in 1204 AD.[105]\n\n\n\n### Christian church[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * Funeral and burial practices\n* Mythology\n\t+ mythological figures\n* Temple\n* Twelve Olympians\n* Underworld\n* Greco-Buddhism\n* Greco-Buddhist monasticism\n |\n| Sacred places | * Eleusis\n* Delphi\n* Delos\n* Dion\n* Dodona\n* Mount Olympus\n* Olympia\n |\n\n |\n| Structures | \n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * Athenian Treasury\n* Lion Gate\n* Long Walls\n* Philippeion\n* Theatre of Dionysus\n* Tunnel of Eupalinos\n |\n| Temples | * Aphaea\n* Artemis\n* Athena Nike\n* Erechtheion\n* Hephaestus\n* Hera, Olympia\n* Parthenon\n* Samothrace\n* Zeus, Olympia\n |\n\n |\n| Language | * Proto-Greek\n* Mycenaean\n* Homeric\n* Dialects\n\t+ Aeolic\n\t+ Arcadocypriot\n\t+ Attic\n\t+ Doric\n\t+ Epirote\n\t+ Ionic\n\t+ Locrian\n\t+ Macedonian\n\t+ Pamphylian\n* Koine\n |\n| Writing | * Linear A\n* Linear B\n* Cypriot syllabary\n* Greek alphabet\n* Greek numerals\n* Attic numerals\n |\n\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n| * Greek colonisation\n |\n| --- |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Magna Graecia | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMeasured at the stylobate, the dimensions of the base of the Parthenon are 69.5 by 30.9 metres (228 by 101 ft). The cella was 29.8 metres long by 19.2 metres wide (97.8 × 63.0 ft). On the exterior, the Doric columns measure 1.9 metres (6.2 ft) in diameter and are 10.4 metres (34 ft) high. The corner columns are slightly larger in diameter. The Parthenon had 46 outer columns and 23 inner columns in total, each column having 20 flutes. (A flute is the concave shaft carved into the column form.) The roof was covered with large overlapping marble tiles known as imbrices and tegulae.[66][67]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nGreen claims that the Parthenon was the room where the *arrephoroi*, a group of four young girls chosen to serve Athena each year, wove a peplos that was presented to Athena during Panathenaic Festivals.[18] Christopher Pelling asserts that the name \"Parthenon\" means the \"temple of the virgin goddess\", referring to the cult of Athena Parthenos that was associated with the temple.[19] It has also been suggested that the name of the temple alludes to the maidens (*parthénoi*), whose supreme sacrifice guaranteed the safety of the city.[20] In that case, the room originally known as the Parthenon could have been a part of the temple known today as the Erechtheion.[21]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe frieze of the Parthenon's entablature contained 92 metopes, 14 each on the east and west sides, 32 each on the north and south sides. They were carved in high relief, a practice employed until then only in treasuries (buildings used to keep votive gifts to the gods).[80] According to the building records, the metope sculptures date to the years 446–440. The metopes of the east side of the Parthenon, above the main entrance, depict the Gigantomachy (the mythical battle between the Olympian gods and the Giants). The metopes of the west end show the Amazonomachy (the mythical battle of the Athenians against the Amazons). The metopes of the south side show the Thessalian Centauromachy (battle of the Lapiths aided by Theseus against the half-man, half-horse Centaurs). \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBecause the Parthenon was dedicated to the Greek goddess Athena it has sometimes been referred to as the Temple of Minerva, the Roman name for Athena, particularly during the 19th century.[28]\n\n\n*Parthénos* was also applied to the Virgin Mary (*Parthénos Maria*) when the Parthenon was converted to a Christian church dedicated to the Virgin Mary in the final decade of the 6th century.[29]\n\n\n\n## Function[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe east pediment originally contained 10 to 12 sculptures depicting the Birth of Athena. Most of those pieces were removed and lost during renovations in either the eighth or the twelfth century.[90] Only two corners remain today with figures depicting the passage of time over the course of a full day. Tethrippa of Helios is in the left corner and Selene is on the right. The horses of Helios's chariot are shown with livid expressions as they ascend into the sky at the start of the day. Selene's horses struggle to stay on the pediment scene as the day comes to an end.[91][92]\n\n\n\n#### West pediment[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Timocreon\n* Tyrtaeus\n* Xenophon\n |\n| Others | * Athenian statesmen\n* Lawgivers\n* Olympic victors\n* Tyrants\n |\n| By culture | * Ancient Greek tribes\n* Thracian Greeks\n* Ancient Macedonians\n |\n\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n| * Society\n* Culture\n |\n| --- |\n| \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Society | * Agriculture\n* Calendar\n* Clothing\n* Coinage\n* Cuisine\n* Economy\n* Education\n* Emporium\n* Euergetism\n* Festivals\n* Folklore\n* Homosexuality\n* Law\n* Olympic Games\n* Pederasty\n* Philosophy\n* Prostitution\n* Religion\n* Slavery\n* Warfare\n* Wedding customs\n* Wine\n |\n| Arts and science | * Architecture\n\t+ Greek Revival architecture\n* Astronomy\n* Literature\n* Mathematics\n* Medicine\n* Music\n\t+ Musical system\n* Pottery\n* Sculpture\n* Technology\n* Theatre\n* Greco-Buddhist art\n |\n| Religion | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe supporters of Athena are extensively illustrated at the back of the left chariot, while the defenders of Poseidon are shown trailing behind the right chariot. It is believed that the corners of the pediment are filled by Athenian water deities, such as the Kephisos river, the Ilissos river, and nymph Kallirhoe. This belief emerges from the fluid character of the sculptures' body position which represents the effort of the artist to give the impression of a flowing river.[93][94] Next to the left river god, there are the sculptures of the mythical king of Athens (Cecrops or Kekrops) with his daughters ( Aglaurus, Pandrosos, Herse). The statue of Poseidon was the largest sculpture in the pediment until it broke into pieces during Francesco Morosini's effort to remove it in 1688. The posterior piece of the torso was found by Lusieri in the groundwork of a Turkish house in 1801 and is currently held in the British Museum. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMetopes 13–21 are missing, but drawings from 1674 attributed to Jaques Carrey indicate a series of humans; these have been variously interpreted as scenes from the Lapith wedding, scenes from the early history of Athens, and various myths.[81] On the north side of the Parthenon, the metopes are poorly preserved, but the subject seems to be the sack of Troy.[9]\n\n\nThe mythological figures of the metopes of the East, North, and West sides of the Parthenon had been deliberately mutilated by Christian iconoclasts in late antiquity.[82]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThis picture was somewhat complicated by the publication of the final report on the 1885–1890 excavations, indicating that the substructure was contemporary with the Kimonian walls, and implying a later date for the first temple.[55]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn December 2022, the British newspaper *The Guardian* published a story with quotes from Greek government officials that suggested negotiations to return the marbles were underway and a \"credible\" solution was being discussed.[137]\n\n\nFour pieces of the sculptures have been repatriated to Greece: 3 from the Vatican, and 1 from a museum in Sicily.[138]\n\n\n\n## Restoration[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"1d991798-432c-4413-9f52-21078c9a07df","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
