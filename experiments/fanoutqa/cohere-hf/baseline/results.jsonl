It was later recognized as an element by Antoine Lavoisier, who named it \"hydrogen\" in 1783.\n\n2. **Helium**: Discovered in 1868 by French astronomer Pierre Janssen while studying the chromosphere of the Sun during a solar eclipse. Independently, Norman Lockyer also identified helium around the same time.\n\n3. **Lithium**: Swedish chemist Johan Arfwedson first discovered lithium in 1817 while analyzing the mineral petalite. However, it was not isolated in its pure form until 1855 by Robert Bunsen and Augustus Matthiessen.\n\n4. **Beryllium**: In 1798, French chemist Louis-Nicolas Vauquelin discovered beryllium in the oxide form (beryllia). Later, Friedrich W\u00f6hler and Antoine Bussy independently isolated the element in 1828.\n\n5. **Boron**: The discovery of boron is attributed to multiple scientists. In 1808, English chemist Humphry Davy identified boron as an element, but he could not isolate it. In 1809, French chemists Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac and Louis Jacques Th\u00e9nard independently isolated boron but did not produce a pure sample.
