the United States surpassed the British Empire's output around 1916,[6] which in turn had surpassed the Qing dynasty in aggregate output decades earlier.[7][8] Since China's transition to a socialist market economy through controlled privatisation and deregulation,[9][10] the country has seen its ranking increase from ninth in 1978, to second in 2010; China's economic growth accelerated during this period and its share of global nominal GDP surged from 2% in 1980 to 18% in 2021.[8][1][11] Among others, India has also experienced an economic boom since the implementation of economic liberalisation in the early 1990s.[12]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n13. **^** \"WEO Database, October 2023.

Nominal GDP does not take into account differences in the cost of living in different countries, and the results can vary greatly from one year to another based on fluctuations in the exchange rates of the country's currency.[3] Such fluctuations may change a country's ranking from one year to the next, even though they often make little or no difference in the standard of living of its population.[4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** \"World Economic Outlook Database, October 2023\". *IMF.org*.

the United States surpassed the British Empire's output around 1916,[6] which in turn had surpassed the Qing dynasty in aggregate output decades earlier.[7][8] Since China's transition to a socialist market economy through controlled privatisation and deregulation,[9][10] the country has seen its ranking increase from ninth in 1978, to second in 2010; China's economic growth accelerated during this period and its share of global nominal GDP surged from 2% in 1980 to 18% in 2021.[8][1][11] Among others, India has also experienced an economic boom since the implementation of economic liberalisation in the early 1990s.[12]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n13. **^** \"WEO Database, October 2023.

Nominal GDP does not take into account differences in the cost of living in different countries, and the results can vary greatly from one year to another based on fluctuations in the exchange rates of the country's currency.[3] Such fluctuations may change a country's ranking from one year to the next, even though they often make little or no difference in the standard of living of its population.[4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** \"World Economic Outlook Database, October 2023\". *IMF.org*.
