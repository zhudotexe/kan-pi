Byzantine emperors Constantine VIII and Basil II, reigning for 66 years in total (962\u20131028) and for 65 years in total (960\u20131025) respectively, are not included, because for part of those periods they reigned only nominally as junior co-emperors alongside senior emperors.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThese monarchs are grouped according to length of reign by year in whole numbers. Within each year-grouping, they appear in historical order. In a given year, there may have been a wide array of actual reign lengths based on days. Thus, this table does not present a precise ranking by length of reign. The list is limited to those that might reasonably be expected to lie within the range of those in the tables above, at minimum 56 years. The list is sorted alphabetically. ***Emphasised*** states were sovereign. Japanese legendary emperors, according to the ancient Japanese calendar, reigned for very long terms of 60\u201370 years each. The longest ruler of the legendary emperors, Emperor K\u014dan, was claimed to have reigned for about 101 years. These figures are not included in the table because they are regarded as inaccurate by modern scholars. For those, see Longevity myths.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n## Monarchs of dependent or constituent states with verifiable reigns by exact date[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.
