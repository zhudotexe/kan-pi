Phelps also won the highest number of medals overall, winning six in total.[6] Bahrain,[c] Botswana, Cyprus, Gabon, Grenada, Guatemala, and Montenegro all won their first Olympic medals, with Bahrain and Grenada winning their nation's first Olympic gold medal.[1] Previously, Montenegrin athletes had competed as nationals of Serbia and Montenegro and of Yugoslavia.[8][d] Taekwondo athlete Milica Mandić from Serbia won the first Olympic gold medal for that nation as an independent nation.[9]\n\n\nDuring and after the Games, many athletes who were caught doping, or tested positive for banned substances, were disqualified from competition and had their medals revoked.[10][11] To date, 40 medals have been stripped, with Russia accounting for 17 of those.[12]\n\n\n\n\n## Medal table\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOverall, 86 nations received at least one medal, and 55 of them won at least one gold medal. Athletes from the United States won the most medals overall, with 104, and the most gold medals, with 48.[a][3] The latter record is the largest gold medal haul for the US at a non-US hosted Olympics.[3] Host nation Great Britain[b] won 29 gold medals and 65 overall medals, making it the most successful Olympics performance for that nation since the 1908 edition.[5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n2012 Summer Olympics medal table[28]| Rank | NOC | Gold | Silver | Bronze | Total |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | ![](image) United States‡ | 48 | 26 | 30 | 104 |\n| 2 | ![](image) China‡ | 39 | 31 | 22 | 92 |\n| 3 | ![](image) Great Britain\\*‡ | 29 | 18 | 18 | 65 |\n| 4 | ![](image) Russia‡ | 18 | 21 | 27 | 66 |\n| 5 | ![](image) South Korea‡ | 13 | 9 | 8 | 30 |\n| 6 | ![](image) Germany‡ | 11 | 20 | 13 | 44 |\n| 7 | ![](image) France‡ | 11 | 11 | 13 | 35 |\n| 8 | ![](image) Australia‡ | 8 | 15 | 12 | 35 |\n| 9 | ![](image) Italy | 8 | 9 | 11 | 28 |\n| 10 | ![](image) Hungary‡ | 8 | 4 | 6 | 18 |\n| 11 | ![](image) Japan | 7 | 14 | 17 | 38 |\n| 12 | ![](image) Iran‡ | 7 | 5 | 1 | 13 |\n| 13 | ![](image) Netherlands | 6 | 6 | 8 | 20 |\n| 14 | ![](image) New Zealand‡ | 6 | 2 | 5 | 13 |\n| 15 | ![](image) Ukraine‡ | 5 | 4 | 10 | 19 |\n| 16 | ![](image) Cuba‡ | 5 | 3 | 7 | 15 |\n| 17 | ![](image) Spain‡ | 4 | 10 | 6 | 20 |\n| 18 | ![](image) Jamaica‡ | 4 | 5 | 4 | 13 |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n1. **^** The United States won 46 gold medals at the Games, and later secured two more as a result of doping samples re-analysis and medal re-allocations.\n2. **^**  The United Kingdom competes under the name Great Britain to include athletes from the Isle of Man, Channel Islands and British Overseas Territories.[4]\n3. **^**  Middle-distance runner Maryam Yusuf Jamal was retroactively awarded a gold medal in 2017 due to doping violations that affected the results of the Women's 1500 metres race. Originally, runner Rashid Ramzi won the Men's 1500 metres race in 2008, but he was stripped of his gold medal the following year after he tested positive for the blood-booster CERA.[7] Furthermore, athlete Ruth Jebet won the Women's 3000 metres steeplechase at the 2016 Summer Olympics prior to Jamal receiving the reallocated gold medal the following year.[7]\n4. **^**  During the 1992 Summer Olympics, Montenegrin athletes competed as Independent Olympic Athletes.[8]\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![Dani King, Laura Trott, and Joanna Rowsell competing in 2012.](image)Great Britain won the first women's team pursuit title with a world record.[17]\n![Photo of Usain Bolt in August 2012.](image)Usain Bolt became the first person to successfully defend both the 100 and 200 metres titles.[18]\n![Photo of the US Women's Soccer Team in 2012](image)The United States won their third consecutive gold medal in women's football.[19]\nSee also: List of 2012 Summer Olympics medal winners\n\nThe medal table is based on information provided by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and is consistent with IOC convention in its published medal tables.
