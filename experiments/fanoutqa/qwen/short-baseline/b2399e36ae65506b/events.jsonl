Of these, the Bureau of Land Management manages 87 million acres (35 million hectares), or 23.8% of the state. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.\n\n\n\n![](image)Map of Geography of Alaska - PDF\nOf the remaining land area, the State of Alaska owns 24.5%; another 10% is managed by thirteen regional and dozens of local Native corporations created under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. Various private interests own the remaining land, totaling less than 1%.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nGeographical features of Alaska\n\nAlaska occupies the northwestern portion of the North American continent and is bordered only by Canada on the east. It is one of two U.S. states not bordered by another state; Hawaii is the other. Alaska has more ocean coastline than all of the other U.S. states combined.[1] About 500 miles (800 km) of Canadian territory separate Alaska from Washington state. Alaska is thus an exclave of the United States that is part of the continental U.S. and the U.S. West Coast, but is not part of the contiguous U.S.[2]\n\n\n\n![](image)Central Alaska in late September, as seen from a satellite\nThe state is bordered by Yukon and British Columbia, Canada to the east, the Gulf of Alaska and the Pacific Ocean to the south, Russia (Chukotka Autonomous Okrug), Bering Sea, the Bering Strait, and Chukchi Sea to the west, and the Beaufort Sea and the Arctic Ocean to the north.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Aleutian Islands cross longitude 180°, so Alaska can be considered the easternmost state as well as the westernmost. Alaska and, especially, the Aleutians are one of the extreme points of the United States. The International Date Line jogs west of 180° to keep the whole state, and thus the entire continental United States, within the same legal day.\n\n\n\n* ![Near Little Port Walter in Southeast Alaska](image)\n\nNear Little Port Walter in Southeast Alaska\n* ![Nushagak River in Southwest Alaska](image)\n\nNushagak River in Southwest Alaska\n* ![Mount Sanford in the Wrangell Mountains](image)\n\nMount Sanford in the Wrangell Mountains\n* ![Kenai River on the Kenai Peninsula](image)\n\nKenai River on the Kenai Peninsula\n* ![Calving glacier](image)\n\nCalving glacier\n\n\n## Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate of Alaska\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Southwest Alaska is largely coastal, bordered by both the Pacific Ocean and the Bering Sea. It is sparsely populated, and unconnected to the road system, but incredibly important to the fishing industry. Half of all fish caught in the western U.S. come from the Bering Sea, and Bristol Bay has the world's largest sockeye salmon fishery. Southwest Alaska includes Katmai and Lake Clark national parks as well as numerous wildlife refuges. The region comprises western Cook Inlet, Bristol Bay and its watersheds, the Alaska Peninsula and the Aleutian Islands. It is known for wet and stormy weather, tundra landscapes, and large populations of salmon, brown bears, caribou, birds, and marine mammals.\n* The Alaska Interior is home to Fairbanks. The geography is marked by large braided rivers, such as the Yukon River and the Kuskokwim River, as well as Arctic tundra lands and shorelines.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nState of Alaska\n |\n| --- |\n| **Juneau** (capital)\n |\n| Topics | * Index\n* Climate\n* Geography\n* Geology\n\t+ Earthquakes\n* Government\n\t+ Delegations\n* History\n* Music\n* People\n* Symbols\n* Transportation\n* Wildlife\n | ![](image)\n |\n| Society | * Abortion\n* Cannabis\n* Climate change\n* Crime\n* Demographics\n* Economy\n* Education\n* Elections\n* Gun laws\n* Homelessness\n* LGBT rights\n* Rural dentistry\n* Politics\n* Sports\n |\n| Regions | * The Bush\n\t+ Arctic\n\t+ Aleutian Islands\n\t+ Alaska Peninsula\n\t+ North Slope\n\t+ Southwest\n\t+ Yukon–Kuskokwim Delta\n* Inside Passage\n* Interior\n* Kenai Peninsula\n* Mat‑Su Valley\n* Seward Peninsula\n* Southcentral\n* Southeast\n* Tanana Valley\n |\n| Largest cities  pop. over 25,000 | * Anchorage\n* Fairbanks\n* Juneau\n |\n| Smaller cities  pop. over 2,000 | * Bethel\n* Cordova\n* Dillingham\n* Homer\n* Kenai\n* Ketchikan\n* Kodiak\n* Kotzebue\n* Nome\n* North Pole\n* Palmer\n* Petersburg\n* Seward\n* Sitka\n* Soldotna\n* Unalaska\n* Valdez\n* Wasilla\n* Wrangell\n* Utqiaġvik\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAlaska is administratively divided into \"boroughs,\" as opposed to \"counties.\" The function is the same, but whereas some states use a three-tiered system of decentralization — state/county/township — most of Alaska only uses two tiers — state/borough. Owing to the state's low population density, most of the land is located in the Unorganized Borough which, as the name implies, has no intermediate borough government of its own, but is administered directly by the state government. Currently (2000 census) 57.71 percent of Alaska's land area has this status; however, its population comprises only 13.05 percent of the state's total.

If the state's westernmost point were superimposed on San Francisco, California, its easternmost point would be in Jacksonville, Florida. Alaska is larger than all but 18 sovereign nations (it is slightly larger than Iran but slightly smaller than Libya). Alaska is home to 3.5 million lakes of 20 acres (8.1 ha) or larger.[3] Marshlands and wetland permafrost cover 188,320 square miles (487,700 km2) (mostly in northern, western and southwest flatlands).

It is one of two U.S. states not bordered by another state; Hawaii is the other. Alaska has more ocean coastline than all of the other U.S. states combined.[1] About 500 miles (800 km) of Canadian territory separate Alaska from Washington state. Alaska is thus an exclave of the United States that is part of the continental U.S. and the U.S. West Coast, but is not part of the contiguous U.S.[2]\n\n\n\n![](image)Central Alaska in late September, as seen from a satellite\nThe state is bordered by Yukon and British Columbia, Canada to the east, the Gulf of Alaska and the Pacific Ocean to the south, Russia (Chukotka Autonomous Okrug), Bering Sea, the Bering Strait, and Chukchi Sea to the west, and the Beaufort Sea and the Arctic Ocean to the north.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Aleutian Islands cross longitude 180°, so Alaska can be considered the easternmost state as well as the westernmost. Alaska and, especially, the Aleutians are one of the extreme points of the United States. The International Date Line jogs west of 180° to keep the whole state, and thus the entire continental United States, within the same legal day.\n\n\n\n* ![Near Little Port Walter in Southeast Alaska](image)\n\nNear Little Port Walter in Southeast Alaska\n* ![Nushagak River in Southwest Alaska](image)\n\nNushagak River in Southwest Alaska\n* ![Mount Sanford in the Wrangell Mountains](image)\n\nMount Sanford in the Wrangell Mountains\n* ![Kenai River on the Kenai Peninsula](image)\n\nKenai River on the Kenai Peninsula\n* ![Calving glacier](image)\n\nCalving glacier\n\n\n## Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate of Alaska\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Southwest Alaska is largely coastal, bordered by both the Pacific Ocean and the Bering Sea. It is sparsely populated, and unconnected to the road system, but incredibly important to the fishing industry. Half of all fish caught in the western U.S. come from the Bering Sea, and Bristol Bay has the world's largest sockeye salmon fishery. Southwest Alaska includes Katmai and Lake Clark national parks as well as numerous wildlife refuges. The region comprises western Cook Inlet, Bristol Bay and its watersheds, the Alaska Peninsula and the Aleutian Islands. It is known for wet and stormy weather, tundra landscapes, and large populations of salmon, brown bears, caribou, birds, and marine mammals.\n* The Alaska Interior is home to Fairbanks. The geography is marked by large braided rivers, such as the Yukon River and the Kuskokwim River, as well as Arctic tundra lands and shorelines.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nState of Alaska\n |\n| --- |\n| **Juneau** (capital)\n |\n| Topics | * Index\n* Climate\n* Geography\n* Geology\n\t+ Earthquakes\n* Government\n\t+ Delegations\n* History\n* Music\n* People\n* Symbols\n* Transportation\n* Wildlife\n | ![](image)\n |\n| Society | * Abortion\n* Cannabis\n* Climate change\n* Crime\n* Demographics\n* Economy\n* Education\n* Elections\n* Gun laws\n* Homelessness\n* LGBT rights\n* Rural dentistry\n* Politics\n* Sports\n |\n| Regions | * The Bush\n\t+ Arctic\n\t+ Aleutian Islands\n\t+ Alaska Peninsula\n\t+ North Slope\n\t+ Southwest\n\t+ Yukon–Kuskokwim Delta\n* Inside Passage\n* Interior\n* Kenai Peninsula\n* Mat‑Su Valley\n* Seward Peninsula\n* Southcentral\n* Southeast\n* Tanana Valley\n |\n| Largest cities  pop. over 25,000 | * Anchorage\n* Fairbanks\n* Juneau\n |\n| Smaller cities  pop. over 2,000 | * Bethel\n* Cordova\n* Dillingham\n* Homer\n* Kenai\n* Ketchikan\n* Kodiak\n* Kotzebue\n* Nome\n* North Pole\n* Palmer\n* Petersburg\n* Seward\n* Sitka\n* Soldotna\n* Unalaska\n* Valdez\n* Wasilla\n* Wrangell\n* Utqiaġvik\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAlaska is administratively divided into \"boroughs,\" as opposed to \"counties.\" The function is the same, but whereas some states use a three-tiered system of decentralization — state/county/township — most of Alaska only uses two tiers — state/borough.
