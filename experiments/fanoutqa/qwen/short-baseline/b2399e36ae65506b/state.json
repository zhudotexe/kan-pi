If the state's westernmost point were superimposed on San Francisco, California, its easternmost point would be in Jacksonville, Florida. Alaska is larger than all but 18 sovereign nations (it is slightly larger than Iran but slightly smaller than Libya). Alaska is home to 3.5 million lakes of 20 acres (8.1\u00a0ha) or larger.[3] Marshlands and wetland permafrost cover 188,320 square miles (487,700\u00a0km2) (mostly in northern, western and southwest flatlands). Frozen water, in the form of glacier ice, covers some 16,000 square miles (41,000\u00a0km2) of land and 1,200 square miles (3,100\u00a0km2) of tidal zone. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Alaska's area compared to the 48 contiguous states Because it extends into the Eastern Hemisphere, it is technically both the westernmost and easternmost state in the United States, as well as also being the northernmost.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* The Alaskan Bush is the remote, less crowded part of the state, encompassing 380 native villages and small towns such as Nome, Bethel, Kotzebue and, most famously, Utqia\u0121vik, the northernmost town in the United States.\n\n\nThe northeast corner of Alaska is covered by the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Much of the northwest is covered by the larger National Petroleum Reserve\u2013Alaska, which covers around 23\u00a0million acres (9,307,770\u00a0ha). The Arctic is Alaska's most remote wilderness.

Of these, the Bureau of Land Management manages 87\u00a0million acres (35\u00a0million hectares), or 23.8% of the state. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.\n\n\n\n![](image)Map of Geography of Alaska - PDF\nOf the remaining land area, the State of Alaska owns 24.5%; another 10% is managed by thirteen regional and dozens of local Native corporations created under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. Various private interests own the remaining land, totaling less than 1%.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nGeographical features of Alaska\n\nAlaska occupies the northwestern portion of the North American continent and is bordered only by Canada on the east. It is one of two U.S. states not bordered by another state; Hawaii is the other. Alaska has more ocean coastline than all of the other U.S. states combined.[1] About 500 miles (800\u00a0km) of Canadian territory separate Alaska from Washington state. Alaska is thus an exclave of the United States that is part of the continental U.S. and the U.S. West Coast, but is not part of the contiguous U.S.[2]\n\n\n\n![](image)Central Alaska in late September, as seen from a satellite\nThe state is bordered by Yukon and British Columbia, Canada to the east, the Gulf of Alaska and the Pacific Ocean to the south, Russia (Chukotka Autonomous Okrug), Bering Sea, the Bering Strait, and Chukchi Sea to the west, and the Beaufort Sea and the Arctic Ocean to the north.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Aleutian Islands cross longitude 180\u00b0, so Alaska can be considered the easternmost state as well as the westernmost. Alaska and, especially, the Aleutians are one of the extreme points of the United States. The International Date Line jogs west of 180\u00b0 to keep the whole state, and thus the entire continental United States, within the same legal day.\n\n\n\n* ![Near Little Port Walter in Southeast Alaska](image)\n\nNear Little Port Walter in Southeast Alaska\n* ![Nushagak River in Southwest Alaska](image)\n\nNushagak River in Southwest Alaska\n* ![Mount Sanford in the Wrangell Mountains](image)\n\nMount Sanford in the Wrangell Mountains\n* ![Kenai River on the Kenai Peninsula](image)\n\nKenai River on the Kenai Peninsula\n* ![Calving glacier](image)\n\nCalving glacier\n\n\n## Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate of Alaska\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Southwest Alaska is largely coastal, bordered by both the Pacific Ocean and the Bering Sea. It is sparsely populated, and unconnected to the road system, but incredibly important to the fishing industry. Half of all fish caught in the western U.S. come from the Bering Sea, and Bristol Bay has the world's largest sockeye salmon fishery. Southwest Alaska includes Katmai and Lake Clark national parks as well as numerous wildlife refuges. The region comprises western Cook Inlet, Bristol Bay and its watersheds, the Alaska Peninsula and the Aleutian Islands. It is known for wet and stormy weather, tundra landscapes, and large populations of salmon, brown bears, caribou, birds, and marine mammals.\n* The Alaska Interior is home to Fairbanks. The geography is marked by large braided rivers, such as the Yukon River and the Kuskokwim River, as well as Arctic tundra lands and shorelines.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nState of Alaska\n |\n| --- |\n| **Juneau** (capital)\n |\n| Topics | * Index\n* Climate\n* Geography\n* Geology\n\t+ Earthquakes\n* Government\n\t+ Delegations\n* History\n* Music\n* People\n* Symbols\n* Transportation\n* Wildlife\n | ![](image)\n |\n| Society | * Abortion\n* Cannabis\n* Climate change\n* Crime\n* Demographics\n* Economy\n* Education\n* Elections\n* Gun laws\n* Homelessness\n* LGBT rights\n* Rural dentistry\n* Politics\n* Sports\n |\n| Regions | * The Bush\n\t+ Arctic\n\t+ Aleutian Islands\n\t+ Alaska Peninsula\n\t+ North Slope\n\t+ Southwest\n\t+ Yukon\u2013Kuskokwim Delta\n* Inside Passage\n* Interior\n* Kenai Peninsula\n* Mat\u2011Su Valley\n* Seward Peninsula\n* Southcentral\n* Southeast\n* Tanana Valley\n |\n| Largest cities  pop. over 25,000 | * Anchorage\n* Fairbanks\n* Juneau\n |\n| Smaller cities  pop. over 2,000 | * Bethel\n* Cordova\n* Dillingham\n* Homer\n* Kenai\n* Ketchikan\n* Kodiak\n* Kotzebue\n* Nome\n* North Pole\n* Palmer\n* Petersburg\n* Seward\n* Sitka\n* Soldotna\n* Unalaska\n* Valdez\n* Wasilla\n* Wrangell\n* Utqia\u0121vik\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAlaska is administratively divided into \"boroughs,\" as opposed to \"counties.\" The function is the same, but whereas some states use a three-tiered system of decentralization \u2014 state/county/township \u2014 most of Alaska only uses two tiers \u2014 state/borough. Owing to the state's low population density, most of the land is located in the Unorganized Borough which, as the name implies, has no intermediate borough government of its own, but is administered directly by the state government. Currently (2000 census) 57.71 percent of Alaska's land area has this status; however, its population comprises only 13.05 percent of the state's total. For statistical purposes the United States Census Bureau divides this territory into census areas. Anchorage merged the city government with the Greater Anchorage Area Borough in 1971 to form the Municipality of Anchorage, containing the city proper, and the bedroom communities of Eagle River, Chugiak, Peters Creek, Girdwood, Bird Creek, and Indian. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe climate of the interior of Alaska is subarctic. Some of the highest and lowest temperatures in Alaska occur around the area near Fairbanks. The summers may have temperatures reaching into the 90s \u00b0F (the low-to-mid 30s \u00b0C), while in the winter, the temperature can fall below \u221260\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221251\u00a0\u00b0C). Precipitation is sparse in the Interior, often less than 10\u00a0in (25\u00a0cm) a year, but what precipitation falls in the winter tends to stay the entire winter.\n\n\nThe highest and lowest recorded temperatures in Alaska are both in the Interior. The highest is 100\u00a0\u00b0F (38\u00a0\u00b0C) in Fort Yukon (which is just 8\u00a0mi or 13\u00a0km inside the arctic circle) on June 27, 1915,[8][9] making Alaska tied with Hawaii as the state with the lowest high temperature in the United States.[10][11] The lowest official Alaska temperature is \u221280\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221262\u00a0\u00b0C) in Prospect Creek on January 23, 1971,[8][9] one degree above the lowest temperature recorded in continental North America (in Snag, Yukon, Canada).[12]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* South Central Alaska is the southern coastal region and contains most of the state's population. Anchorage and many growing towns, such as Palmer, and Wasilla, lie within this area. Petroleum industrial plants, transportation, tourism, and two military bases form the core of the economy here.\n* The Alaska Panhandle, also known as Southeast Alaska, is home to many of Alaska's larger towns including the state capital Juneau, tidewater glaciers and extensive forests. Tourism, fishing, forestry and state government anchor the economy.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Bering Glacier complex near the southeastern border with Yukon, Canada, covers 2,250 square miles (5,800\u00a0km2) alone.\n\n\n\n\n## Regions[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Alaska has more acreage of public land owned by the federal government than any other state.[5]\nThe climate in south and southeastern Alaska is a mid-latitude oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: *Cfb*), and a subarctic oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen *Cfc*) in the northern parts. On an annual basis, the southeast is both the wettest and warmest part of Alaska with milder temperatures in the winter and high precipitation throughout the year. Juneau averages over 50\u00a0in (130\u00a0cm) of precipitation a year, and Ketchikan averages over 150\u00a0in (380\u00a0cm).[6] This is also the only region in Alaska in which the average daytime high temperature is above freezing during the winter months.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWith its numerous islands, Alaska has nearly 34,000 miles (55,000\u00a0km) of tidal shoreline. The island chain extending west from the southern tip of the Alaska Peninsula is called the Aleutian Islands. Many active volcanoes are found in the Aleutians. For example, Unimak Island is home to Mount Shishaldin, a moderately active volcano that rises to 9,980 feet (3,042\u00a0m) above sea level. The chain of volcanoes extends to Mount Spurr, west of Anchorage on the mainland.\n\n\nOne of North America's largest tides occurs in Turnagain Arm just south of Anchorage. Tidal differences can be more than 35 feet (10.7\u00a0m). (Many sources say Turnagain has the second-greatest tides in North America, but it has since been shown that several areas in Canada have larger tides, according to an Anchorage Daily News article dated 6/23/03.[4])\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Boroughs | * Aleutians East\n* Anchorage\n* Bristol Bay\n* Denali\n* Fairbanks North Star\n* Haines\n* Juneau\n* Kenai Peninsula\n* Ketchikan Gateway\n* Kodiak Island\n* Lake and Peninsula\n* Matanuska\u2011Susitna\n* North Slope\n* Northwest Arctic\n* Petersburg\n* Sitka\n* Skagway\n* Wrangell\n* Yakutat\n* Unorganized\n |\n| Native corporations | * Arctic Slope Regional Corporation\n* Bering Straits Native Corporation\n* NANA Regional Corporation\n* Calista Corporation\n* Doyon, Limited\n* Cook Inlet Region, Inc.\n* Bristol Bay Native Corporation\n* The Aleut Corporation\n* Chugach Alaska Corporation\n* Sealaska Corporation\n* Koniag, Incorporated\n* Ahtna, Incorporated\n* The 13th Regional Corporation\n |\n| Census Areas | * Aleutians West\n* Bethel\n* Chugach\n* Copper River\n* Dillingham\n* Hoonah\u2013Angoon\n* Kusilvak\n* Nome\n* Prince of Wales\u2013Hyder\n* Southeast Fairbanks\n* Yukon\u2013Koyukuk\n |\n| **![flag](image) Alaska portal**\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
