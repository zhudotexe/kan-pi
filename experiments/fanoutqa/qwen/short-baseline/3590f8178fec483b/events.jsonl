Founded by a group of Swiss, German, English and Catalan footballers led by Joan Gamper, the club has become a symbol of Catalan culture and Catalanism, hence the motto *\"Més que un club\"* (More than a club). The official Barça anthem is the \"Cant del Barça\", written by Jaume Picas and Josep Maria Espinàs.[2] Unlike many other football clubs, the *socis*, who are the members and supporters of the club, own and operate Barcelona. It is the world's fourth richest football club in terms of revenue, with an annual turnover of €582.1 million in the 2020–21 season.[3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Barcelona players that have been the top scorer of UEFA Champions League:[79]\n\t+ ![Netherlands](image) Ronald Koeman (1993–94, 8 goals in 12 games)\n\t+ ![Brazil](image) Rivaldo (1999–2000, 10 goals in 14 games)\n\t+ ![Argentina](image) Lionel Messi (2008–09, 9 goals in 12 games; 2009–10, 8 goals in 11 games; 2010–11, 12 goals in 13 games; 2011–12, 14 goals in 11 games; 2014–15, 10 goals in 13 games; 2018–19, 12 goals in 10 games)\n\t+ ![Brazil](image) Neymar (2014–15, 10 goals in 12 games)\n* Barcelona players that have been the top scorer of FIFA Club World Cup:\n\t+ ![Brazil](image) Adriano (2011, 2 goals in 1 game)\n\t+ ![Argentina](image) Lionel Messi (2011, 2 goals in 2 games)\n\t+ ![Uruguay](image) Luis Suárez (2015, 5 goals in 2 games)\n\n\n### Other individual records for the club[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n2016\n* **International Champions Cup**:\n\n\n* **Winners (1)**:\n\n2017\n* **Audi Cup**:\n\n\n* **Winners (1)**:\n\n2011\n* **LaLiga-Serie A Cup**:\n\n\n* **Winners (1)**:\n\n2019\n### Awards[edit]\n\n\n* **Laureus World Team of the Year**\n\t+ **Winner:** 2012\n\n\n* **IFFHS World Club Team of the Year**\n\t+ **Winners:** 1997, 2009, 2011, 2012, 2015\n\n\n* **Globe Soccer Best Club of the Year**\n\t+ **Winners:** 2011, 2015\n\n\n* **World Soccer Men's World Team of the Year**\n\t+ **Winners:** 2006, 2009, 2011, 2015\n\n\n* **IFFHS World’s Best Club of the Decade**\n\t+ **Winners:** 2001-2010, 2011-2020\n\n\n* **IFFHS World’s Best Continental Club of the Century**\n\t+ *3rd Place:* 1901-2000\n\n\n* **FIFA Club of the Century**:\n\t+ *4th Place:* 1901-2000\n\n\n## Players records[edit]\n\n\n### Most appearances[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of FC Barcelona players\n\n#### All competitions[edit]\n\n\n*As of match played 4 June 2023*[1]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Barcelona players that were included in the UEFA Team of the Year:\n\t+ ![Argentina](image) Lionel Messi (12), ![Spain](image) Andrés Iniesta (6), ![Spain](image) Carles Puyol (6), ![Spain](image) Xavi (5), ![Spain](image) Gerard Piqué (5), ![Brazil](image) Ronaldinho (3), ![Brazil](image) Dani Alves (3), ![Cameroon](image) Samuel Eto'o (2), ![Sweden](image) Patrik Andersson (1), ![Italy](image) Gianluca Zambrotta (1), ![Sweden](image) Zlatan Ibrahimović (1), ![Spain](image) David Villa (1), ![France](image) Eric Abidal (1), ![Brazil](image) Neymar (1), ![Netherlands](image) Frenkie de Jong (1)\n* Barcelona players that have received an IFFHS Men's World Team award:\n\t+ ![Argentina](image) Lionel Messi (5), ![Brazil](image) Neymar (1), ![Netherlands](image) Frenkie de Jong (1)\n* Barcelona players that have won the European Golden Shoe:[1]\n\t+ ![Brazil](image) Ronaldo (1996–97, 34 goals in 37 games)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBarcelona has signed several high-profile players, setting the world record in transfer fees on three occasions with the purchase of Johan Cruyff from Ajax in 1973, Diego Maradona from Boca Juniors in 1982 and Ronaldo from PSV Eindhoven in 1996.

The club won the Catalan Championship a record 23 times during the 40-year span of the tournament.[6]\n\n\nWhen the national league was established in 1929, the importance of the regional league declined, and it was abandoned in 1940. From then on, Barcelona did not participate in regional competitions until the establishment of the Copa Catalunya in 1993, a cup they have won a record nine times.[6]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n82. **^** \"Iniesta plays fourth Champions League Final\". 6 June 2015.
