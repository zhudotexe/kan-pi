The first two were marketed as the \"AFLâ€“NFL World Championship Game\", but were also casually referred to as \"the Super Bowl game\" during the television broadcast.[3] Super Bowl III in January 1969 was the first such game that carried the \"Super Bowl\" moniker in official marketing; the names \"Super Bowl I\" and \"Super Bowl II\" were retroactively applied to the first two games.[4]\n\n\nA total of 20 franchises, including teams that have relocated to another city or changed their name, have won the Super Bowl.[5] There are four NFL teams that have never appeared in a Super Bowl: the Cleveland Browns, Detroit Lions, Jacksonville Jaguars, and Houston Texans, though both the Browns (1950, 1954, 1955, 1964) and Lions (1935, 1952, 1953, 1957) had won NFL Championship Games prior to the creation of the Super Bowl in the 1966 season. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** The Broncos are the only NFL team with both consecutive wins and consecutive losses at the Super Bowl.\n2. **^** The New York Jets and Baltimore/Indianapolis Colts (Super Bowl III) is the only Super Bowl matchup that cannot be repeated under the current playoff alignment, as the Colts have since been placed in the AFC (at the time, along with all of the former AFL teams, including the Jets) as part of the AFLâ€“NFL merger in 1970. For the same reason, it is the only Super Bowl rematch that is capable of being played in the postseason outside of the Super Bowl.\n3. **^** The Dallas Cowboys and Buffalo Bills are the only NFL teams to face each other in consecutive Super Bowls, XXVII and XXVIII.\n4. **^** This is the only rematch pairing in which one team has relocated in the interim.

The first two were marketed as the \"AFLâ€“NFL World Championship Game\", but were also casually referred to as \"the Super Bowl game\" during the television broadcast.[3] Super Bowl III in January 1969 was the first such game that carried the \"Super Bowl\" moniker in official marketing; the names \"Super Bowl I\" and \"Super Bowl II\" were retroactively applied to the first two games.[4]\n\n\nA total of 20 franchises, including teams that have relocated to another city or changed their name, have won the Super Bowl.[5] There are four NFL teams that have never appeared in a Super Bowl: the Cleveland Browns, Detroit Lions, Jacksonville Jaguars, and Houston Texans, though both the Browns (1950, 1954, 1955, 1964) and Lions (1935, 1952, 1953, 1957) had won NFL Championship Games prior to the creation of the Super Bowl in the 1966 season. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** The Broncos are the only NFL team with both consecutive wins and consecutive losses at the Super Bowl.\n2. **^** The New York Jets and Baltimore/Indianapolis Colts (Super Bowl III) is the only Super Bowl matchup that cannot be repeated under the current playoff alignment, as the Colts have since been placed in the AFC (at the time, along with all of the former AFL teams, including the Jets) as part of the AFLâ€“NFL merger in 1970. For the same reason, it is the only Super Bowl rematch that is capable of being played in the postseason outside of the Super Bowl.\n3. **^** The Dallas Cowboys and Buffalo Bills are the only NFL teams to face each other in consecutive Super Bowls, XXVII and XXVIII.\n4. **^** This is the only rematch pairing in which one team has relocated in the interim.
