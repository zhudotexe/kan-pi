The expedition examined ascent routes both north and south of the mountain and made best progress up the north-east ridge before they were forced to abandon their efforts.[8] Since that time K2 has developed the reputation of being a more difficult mountain to climb than Mount Everest – every route to the summit is tough.[9][note 5] K2 is farther north than the Himalayan mountains so the climate is colder; the Karakoram range is wider than the Himalayan so more ice and snow is trapped there.[12]\n\n\nBefore the successful Italian ascent, the expedition that had previously climbed highest on K2 had been the 1939 American Karakoram expedition which reached 8,370 metres (27,450 ft).[13]\n\n\n\n### Previous Italian expeditions in the Baltoro Muztagh Karakoram[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThree earlier unsuccessful American attempts on the mountain had identified a good route to use. Desio felt Italy's earlier exploration of the Karakoram region gave good reason to mount a major expedition which he did on a grand scale, following the American route up the south-east ridge. Progress towards the summit was repeatedly interrupted by storms and one member of the team died rather unexpectedly. Desio considered abandoning the expedition so as to try again by returning later in the year, but then weather conditions improved allowing them to edge closer to the top of the mountain. At last the two lead climbers reached the summit as the sun was about to set and they had to descend in the dark. They and two colleagues went on to suffer from severe frostbite.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** The tallest mountains measured were called \"K1\" and \"K2\" and the higher one turned out to be K2.[2]\n2. **^** Hence the earlier name of K2 was \"Mount Godwin-Austen\".[3]\n3. **^** Video hosted on Vimeo at https://vimeo.com/54661540\n4. **^** Video hosted on Google at https://storage.googleapis.com/cctv-library/cctv/library/2005/01/DrHouston\\_01092005/DrHouston\\_01092005.broadband.mp4\n5. **^** K2 may be the most challenging of all the eight thousand foot mountains although Annapurna has a higher death rate for climbers than either Everest or K2.[10] Kauffman and Putnam liken the comparison between Everest and K2 to that between Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn in the Alps.[11]\n6. **^** In 1953 Desio had travelled by air in Italy and from Karachi to Rawalpindi, while Cassin had to go by train. Both men flew from Rome to Karachi, however.[28]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFirst successful attempt to climb K2\n\n\n\n\n\n![](image)Compagnoni (left) and Lacedelli, frostbitten on their return from the summit of K2\nOn the **1954 Italian expedition to K2** (led by Ardito Desio) Achille Compagnoni and Lino Lacedelli became the first people to reach the summit of K2, 8,611 metres (28,251 ft), the second highest mountain in the world. They reached the summit on 31 July 1954. K2 is more difficult to climb than Mount Everest, 8,849 metres (29,032 ft), which had first been climbed by a British expedition in 1953.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nK2 is on the border between China and what was in 1954 the newly independent Pakistan.

The expedition examined ascent routes both north and south of the mountain and made best progress up the north-east ridge before they were forced to abandon their efforts.[8] Since that time K2 has developed the reputation of being a more difficult mountain to climb than Mount Everest – every route to the summit is tough.[9][note 5] K2 is farther north than the Himalayan mountains so the climate is colder; the Karakoram range is wider than the Himalayan so more ice and snow is trapped there.[12]\n\n\nBefore the successful Italian ascent, the expedition that had previously climbed highest on K2 had been the 1939 American Karakoram expedition which reached 8,370 metres (27,450 ft).[13]\n\n\n\n### Previous Italian expeditions in the Baltoro Muztagh Karakoram[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThree earlier unsuccessful American attempts on the mountain had identified a good route to use. Desio felt Italy's earlier exploration of the Karakoram region gave good reason to mount a major expedition which he did on a grand scale, following the American route up the south-east ridge. Progress towards the summit was repeatedly interrupted by storms and one member of the team died rather unexpectedly. Desio considered abandoning the expedition so as to try again by returning later in the year, but then weather conditions improved allowing them to edge closer to the top of the mountain. At last the two lead climbers reached the summit as the sun was about to set and they had to descend in the dark. They and two colleagues went on to suffer from severe frostbite.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** The tallest mountains measured were called \"K1\" and \"K2\" and the higher one turned out to be K2.[2]\n2. **^** Hence the earlier name of K2 was \"Mount Godwin-Austen\".[3]\n3. **^** Video hosted on Vimeo at https://vimeo.com/54661540\n4. **^** Video hosted on Google at https://storage.googleapis.com/cctv-library/cctv/library/2005/01/DrHouston\\_01092005/DrHouston\\_01092005.broadband.mp4\n5. **^** K2 may be the most challenging of all the eight thousand foot mountains although Annapurna has a higher death rate for climbers than either Everest or K2.[10] Kauffman and Putnam liken the comparison between Everest and K2 to that between Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn in the Alps.[11]\n6. **^** In 1953 Desio had travelled by air in Italy and from Karachi to Rawalpindi, while Cassin had to go by train.
