Its membership, as set by the Judiciary Act of 1869, consists of the chief justice of the United States and eight associate justices, any six of whom constitute a quorum.[1][2] Article II, Section 2, Clause 2 of the Constitution grants plenary power to the president of the United States to nominate, and with the advice and consent of the United States Senate, appoint justices to the Supreme Court; justices have life tenure.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Supreme Court of the United States\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n5. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** While Justice Wilson was the first to take the oath of office, \u00a7\u00a01 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 prescribes precedence of the associate justices by the dates their judicial commissions bear.

The commissions of the first four associate justices bear the following dates: Rutledge, Sept.\u00a026, 1789; Cushing, Sept.\u00a027; Wilson, Sept.\u00a029; and Blair, Sept.\u00a030.\n6. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** ***k*** ***l*** Recess appointment.

Every person who has been nominated to the Court has been an attorney.[1]\n\n\nBefore the advent of modern law schools in the United States, justices, like most attorneys of the time, completed their legal studies by \"reading law\" (studying under and acting as an apprentice to more experienced attorneys) rather than attending a formal program. The first Justice to be appointed who had attended an actual law school was Levi Woodbury, appointed to the Court in 1846. Woodbury had attended Tapping Reeve Law School in Litchfield, Connecticut, the most prestigious law school in the United States in that day, prior to his admission to the bar in 1812. However, Woodbury did not earn a law degree. Woodbury's successor on the Court, Benjamin Robbins Curtis, who received his law degree from Harvard Law School in 1832, and was appointed to the Court in 1851, was the first Justice to bear such a credential.[2]\n\n\nAssociate Justice James F. Byrnes, whose short tenure lasted from June 1941 to October 1942, was the last Justice without a law degree to be appointed; Stanley Forman Reed, who served on the Court from 1938 to 1957, was the last sitting Justice from such a background. In total, of the 114 justices appointed to the Court, 49 have had law degrees, an additional 18 attended some law school but did not receive a degree, and 47 received their legal education without any law school attendance.[2]\n\n\nCurrently serving justices are listed in **bold** below.\n\n\n\n\n## Four or more justices[edit]\n\n\n* Harvard Law School \u2013 22 alumni; 18 graduates\n\t1.
