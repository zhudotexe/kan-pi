These trees are both tall and large in diameter and, in particular, hold a large diameter high up the trunk. Measurement is very complex, particularly if branch volume is to be included as well as the trunk volume, so measurements have only been made for a small number of trees, and generally only for the trunk. Few attempts have ever been made to include root or leaf volume.\n\n\nAll 12 of the world's largest trees are giant sequoias. Grogan's Fault, the largest living Coast redwood, would rank as the 13th largest living tree. Tāne Mahuta, the largest living tree outside of California, would rank within the top 100 largest living trees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDespite the high heights attained by trees nowadays, records exist of much greater heights in the past, before widespread logging took place. Some, if not most, of these records are without a doubt greatly exaggerated, but some have been reportedly measured with semi-reliable instruments when cut down and on the ground. Some of the heights recorded in this way exceed the maximum possible height of a tree as calculated by theorists,[29] lending some limited credibility to speculation that some superlative trees are able to 'reverse' transpiration streams and absorb water through needles in foggy environments. All three of the tallest tree species continue to be Coast redwoods, Douglas fir and Giant mountain ash.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n25. **^** Odilla, Fernanda (September 1, 2019). \"Pesquisadores encontram arvore mais alta da Amazonia...etc\". *BBC News Brasil*.

These trees are both tall and large in diameter and, in particular, hold a large diameter high up the trunk. Measurement is very complex, particularly if branch volume is to be included as well as the trunk volume, so measurements have only been made for a small number of trees, and generally only for the trunk. Few attempts have ever been made to include root or leaf volume.\n\n\nAll 12 of the world's largest trees are giant sequoias. Grogan's Fault, the largest living Coast redwood, would rank as the 13th largest living tree. Tāne Mahuta, the largest living tree outside of California, would rank within the top 100 largest living trees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDespite the high heights attained by trees nowadays, records exist of much greater heights in the past, before widespread logging took place. Some, if not most, of these records are without a doubt greatly exaggerated, but some have been reportedly measured with semi-reliable instruments when cut down and on the ground. Some of the heights recorded in this way exceed the maximum possible height of a tree as calculated by theorists,[29] lending some limited credibility to speculation that some superlative trees are able to 'reverse' transpiration streams and absorb water through needles in foggy environments. All three of the tallest tree species continue to be Coast redwoods, Douglas fir and Giant mountain ash.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n25. **^** Odilla, Fernanda (September 1, 2019). \"Pesquisadores encontram arvore mais alta da Amazonia...etc\". *BBC News Brasil*.
