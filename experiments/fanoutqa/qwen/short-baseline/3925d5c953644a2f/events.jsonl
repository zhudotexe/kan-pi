The series revolves around Harvey Specter (Gabriel Macht), a senior partner at a top law firm in Manhattan, and his recently hired associate attorney Mike Ross (Patrick J. Adams) as they hide the fact that Mike does not have a law degree. Each episode focuses on a single legal case and its challenges while examining the work environment of the firm, Mike's and Harvey's personal relationships, and problems stemming from Mike's lack of a degree. The rest of the starring cast portray other employees at the firm: Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman), a partner who manages the associates; Rachel Zane (Meghan Markle), a paralegal who develops feelings for Mike; Donna Paulsen (Sarah Rafferty), Harvey's long-time legal secretary, close friend, and confidante; and Jessica Pearson (Gina Torres), the co-founder and managing partner of the firm.\n\n\n\n\n## Overview\n\n[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Actor\n | Character\n | Seasons\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |\n| Gabriel Macht | Harvey Specter | Main |\n| Patrick J.

In episode 1 of season 8, it is revealed he was born and raised in Riverside, NY, the same town as fellow attorney Samantha Wheeler. In the pilot episode, he is told of his promotion to senior partner—the youngest to hold that position—and is forced to hire a Harvard Law School graduate to be his associate attorney. He is impressed with Mike Ross' quick thinking and drive to be a good lawyer, as well as his inherent ability to absorb enormous amounts of information (his photographic memory) and his extensive knowledge of law. Mike, however, does not have a law degree, but is hired anyway because Harvey does not want to waste time interviewing less-promising candidates. Mike reminds Harvey of a younger version of himself, and so they agree to conspire to pretend that Mike is, in fact, a Harvard graduate. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the season two episode \"Sucker Punch\", Louis has Mike hooked up to a lie detector (as a means of getting information about Harvey) and asks Mike where he attended law school. Mike answers that he has a diploma from Harvard Law School, which is an essentially true statement, and it seems to have eased Louis's suspicions. As of the season 2 episode \"Asterisk,\" Louis has been promoted to senior partner by Daniel Hardman. He has the deciding vote in the firm's managing partner vote; though he is angry with Hardman for treating him poorly in the past, he is also angry with Jessica for the way she has constantly overlooked him in recent years. He ultimately votes in favor of Hardman which gives Jessica's position to Hardman by one vote, although this is short-lived.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Rachael Harris\n**Sheila Amanda Sazs**, played by Rachael Harris, is a high-level official in the Harvard Law School placement department, whose job is to place graduates as associate attorney positions at law firms. As such, she works with recruiters from top law firms such as Pearson Hardman, always trying to get maximum return for her graduates. She and Louis have had an on-off sexual relationship, and she appears to be turned on by his power, especially after he makes senior partner. Louis's relationship with Sheila helps him discover that there is no record of Mike Ross attending Harvard Law. Sheila and Louis get engaged in season 3, but break up soon after when they discover they want very different things after marriage.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n**Kyle Durant**, played by Ben Hollingsworth, is an associate attorney at Pearson Hardman during season 1. He is a favorite of Louis Litt, under whom all the associates work, and Louis frequently pits him against Mike Ross, the protégé of Louis's own rival Harvey Specter. Louis comments to Harvey that the rivalry between Kyle and Mike reminds him of their own rivalry as associates. Kyle is arrogant and lacking in morals, going so far as to renege on an oral settlement agreement in a mock trial against Mike and then mocking him in a whisper. When Rachel Zane needed a date for her double date with Mike and his girlfriend late in season one, she asks Kyle to go with her though she knows about Kyle and Mike's rivalry, and Mike suspects she was using Kyle to make Mike jealous. The character did not appear after season 1, with no mention of what happened to Kyle.\n\n\n\n### Harold Gunderson\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | **This article has multiple issues.** Please help **improve it** or discuss these issues on the **talk page**. *(Learn how and when to remove these messages)*\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This article **may contain an excessive amount of intricate detail that may interest only a particular audience**.

He serves as one of the main characters of season 8, as he competes with Samantha to get his name on the wall next after a merger with Robert Zane. Harvey and Robert ultimately agree to put both Samantha's and Alex's names on the wall. It's revealed in season 9 that Alex, under duress, helped cover up the Reform Corp prison murder while at Bratton Gould, something that has haunted him ever since.\n\n\n\n### Samantha Wheeler\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAt first Mike had broken off their relationship following this betrayal. Mike tells Rachel that he needs time to think about things, and starts living in a hotel. Mike then relented, realizing he cared greatly for her, enough to overlook the incident and he moved back in after she approached him and convinced him to do so. For the remainder of the season, Mike is in the background, doing side work, and helping solve issues as Louis Litt's deal with Forstman falls apart. Mike, through his own compassion in the final summer episode of *Suits*, \"This is Rome...\" returns Louis's possessions to his house. When there, and attempting to comfort Louis, he asks about a key he found in Louis's box of things. At first, Louis takes it as playful and dismisses him. However, after Mike asks about the key again when he failed to get Louis hired with Robert Zane, Louis is able to piece together that Mike truly isn't a Harvard graduate.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHarvey confirms this again in the series finale while arguing about Louis with special master Faye Richardson, telling her that she took \"the best lawyer in this firm\" and stripped him of his dignity.\n\n\nHe has been rightfully suspicious of Mike Ross' status as a Harvard graduate since he was hired, especially when he found out that Mike does not have file in Harvard archive . When Harvey is accused of suppressing evidence, Louis is asked to stand-in for prosecutor (to-be) Travis Tanner in the mock trial. He uses the mock trial to confront Jessica about Harvey's better treatment.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n**Harold Gunderson**, played by Max Topplin, is a former associate attorney at Pearson Hardman who works for Bratton Gould as of season 2. Harold is socially awkward, sensitive, and his infatuation with Rachel Zane is not reciprocated and makes her uncomfortable. He gets along well with Mike Ross, and the two are sometimes seen working together. Louis Litt tends to treat Harold poorly; Louis verbally abuses Harold and once forced him to watch over his ill cat even after discovering that Harold is severely allergic to cats.[3] Despite Harold's clumsiness and seemingly poor legal skills, he was actually a very good student at Harvard, confiding to Mike that it is only Louis's domineering management that makes him appear flustered and incompetent. Louis eventually fires Harold in the wake of clients leaving the firm. However, through his connections with Jimmy, a former Pearson Hardman associate, Mike is able to get Harold a new job at Jimmy's new firm Bratton Gould.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn season 2 episode 3, Rachel is seen taking the LSAT after work. Rachel eventually gets a 172 on her LSAT, passing the criteria to gain admission into Harvard Law. It is revealed late in season 2 that, despite her score and being a legacy via her father, she does not rate highly enough among all the applicants to get into the next semester's Harvard Law class. Louis discovers this and, to spare Rachel's feelings, blames it on his affair with Sheila Sazs going badly. In episode 10 of season 2, Mike finds out the real reason Daniel Hardman returned to the firm and excitedly kisses Rachel. However, she stops it saying they can't happen like this, because Mike's grandmother has just died, and when things like that happen people do not make smart decisions. Mike tells her that being smart has not made any of them happy. Rachel then decides to visit Mike, telling him he's right and that she does not want to make the smart choice. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter Hardman has been ousted once again and Jessica reinstated as managing partner, his relationship with Harvey is severely damaged, but Louis tries to move on. As a newly minted senior partner, Louis is entitled to hire a Harvard Law graduate as an associate attorney of his own. He becomes smitten with Maria (the secretary of her Harvard class and former US Supreme Court clerk) who accepts his offer; but by chance when she is introduced to Donna and it becomes clear that Mike's undercover status as a fraudulent HLS graduate could be put in jeopardy, Jessica is forced to order Louis to rescind the offer, leaving him angry and embittered.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn season 4, it is revealed that Jessica had been engaging in a romantic relationship with a senior prosecutor for the SEC (Jeff Malone) for quite some time. She hires him at the firm at the beginning of the season, but insists to him that the romantic side of their relationship is finished as long as he is at the firm. She eventually relents and changes her mind on this, after Malone's respectful but incessant forcing of emotions on her, him wanting to keep both parts of their relationship. Eventually, she is forced to lie to Jeff about the truth behind Louis's sudden resignation and near-immediate return, which puts their relationship on the line. When Jeff finds out that she had been lying, he breaks up with her, and resigns from the firm a few days later.\n\n\nIn season 6, Jessica leaves the firm to Louis and Harvey to explore more of herself by moving to Chicago to live with Jeff. She appears in season 7 on various occasions.\n\n\n\n### Katrina Bennett\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nJessica is in a quandary with respect to Harvey: she realizes Harvey is her greatest asset and the firm's best rainmaker because of his willingness to do whatever it takes to win, but she has difficulty controlling him and she cannot trust him to do exactly as she instructs. Jessica is divorced from Quentin Sainz, a pharmaceutical chemist and businessman who was diagnosed with ALS, and later dies in the third-season episode 'Yesterday's Gone'.\n\n\nAt the end of season 1, Trevor Evans tells her that Mike does not have a law degree and Harvey is protecting Mike. When Jessica investigates, she discovers that Harvard's records show that Mike has a law school diploma, but she also finds that he has no record of an undergraduate degree, convincing her that the Harvard degree is a fraud. Even though she plans to have Harvey fire Mike, she lets Mike continue working because Daniel Hardman returns to the firm and Harvey threatens to quit if Mike is fired, leaving her vulnerable to Daniel.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWhile on the stand, Harvey is able to destroy his credibility and testimony in open court, pointing out that Trevor has a long criminal past, his girlfriend (Jenny) left him for Mike once she found out he was dealing, and that he is only appearing because he was promised immunity.\n\n\n\n### Edith Ross\n\n[edit]\n\n**Edith Ross**, played by Rebecca Schull, is Mike Ross' paternal grandmother and guardian after his parents' deaths. Mike placed her in a nursing home after she fell while she was alone. To pay for a private nursing home and keep her out of a state facility, he began taking the LSAT for others and accepts a temporary job dealing marijuana for his friend Trevor Evans. Edith dislikes Trevor and referred to him as an anchor dragging Mike down. She knows that Mike has been smoking marijuana and only wants him to live up to his potential.[1] She dies at the end of the season two episode \"Asterisk\".\n\n\nIn seasons 3, 4 and 5, Edith reappears, but only in flashback sequences.\n\n\n\n### Kyle Durant\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"536272da-653a-4f08-8774-ef45b96cf66b","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

The rest of the starring cast portray other employees at the firm: Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman), a partner who manages the associates; Rachel Zane (Meghan Markle), a paralegal who develops feelings for Mike; Donna Paulsen (Sarah Rafferty), Harvey's long-time legal secretary, close friend, and confidante; and Jessica Pearson (Gina Torres), the co-founder and managing partner of the firm.\n\n\n\n\n## Overview\n\n[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Actor\n | Character\n | Seasons\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |\n| Gabriel Macht | Harvey Specter | Main |\n| Patrick J.

In episode 1 of season 8, it is revealed he was born and raised in Riverside, NY, the same town as fellow attorney Samantha Wheeler. In the pilot episode, he is told of his promotion to senior partner—the youngest to hold that position—and is forced to hire a Harvard Law School graduate to be his associate attorney. He is impressed with Mike Ross' quick thinking and drive to be a good lawyer, as well as his inherent ability to absorb enormous amounts of information (his photographic memory) and his extensive knowledge of law. Mike, however, does not have a law degree, but is hired anyway because Harvey does not want to waste time interviewing less-promising candidates. Mike reminds Harvey of a younger version of himself, and so they agree to conspire to pretend that Mike is, in fact, a Harvard graduate. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the season two episode \"Sucker Punch\", Louis has Mike hooked up to a lie detector (as a means of getting information about Harvey) and asks Mike where he attended law school. Mike answers that he has a diploma from Harvard Law School, which is an essentially true statement, and it seems to have eased Louis's suspicions. As of the season 2 episode \"Asterisk,\" Louis has been promoted to senior partner by Daniel Hardman. He has the deciding vote in the firm's managing partner vote; though he is angry with Hardman for treating him poorly in the past, he is also angry with Jessica for the way she has constantly overlooked him in recent years. He ultimately votes in favor of Hardman which gives Jessica's position to Hardman by one vote, although this is short-lived.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Rachael Harris\n**Sheila Amanda Sazs**, played by Rachael Harris, is a high-level official in the Harvard Law School placement department, whose job is to place graduates as associate attorney positions at law firms. As such, she works with recruiters from top law firms such as Pearson Hardman, always trying to get maximum return for her graduates. She and Louis have had an on-off sexual relationship, and she appears to be turned on by his power, especially after he makes senior partner. Louis's relationship with Sheila helps him discover that there is no record of Mike Ross attending Harvard Law. Sheila and Louis get engaged in season 3, but break up soon after when they discover they want very different things after marriage.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n**Kyle Durant**, played by Ben Hollingsworth, is an associate attorney at Pearson Hardman during season 1. He is a favorite of Louis Litt, under whom all the associates work, and Louis frequently pits him against Mike Ross, the protégé of Louis's own rival Harvey Specter. Louis comments to Harvey that the rivalry between Kyle and Mike reminds him of their own rivalry as associates. Kyle is arrogant and lacking in morals, going so far as to renege on an oral settlement agreement in a mock trial against Mike and then mocking him in a whisper. When Rachel Zane needed a date for her double date with Mike and his girlfriend late in season one, she asks Kyle to go with her though she knows about Kyle and Mike's rivalry, and Mike suspects she was using Kyle to make Mike jealous. The character did not appear after season 1, with no mention of what happened to Kyle.\n\n\n\n### Harold Gunderson\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | **This article has multiple issues.** Please help **improve it** or discuss these issues on the **talk page**. *(Learn how and when to remove these messages)*\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This article **may contain an excessive amount of intricate detail that may interest only a particular audience**.

He serves as one of the main characters of season 8, as he competes with Samantha to get his name on the wall next after a merger with Robert Zane. Harvey and Robert ultimately agree to put both Samantha's and Alex's names on the wall. It's revealed in season 9 that Alex, under duress, helped cover up the Reform Corp prison murder while at Bratton Gould, something that has haunted him ever since.\n\n\n\n### Samantha Wheeler\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAt first Mike had broken off their relationship following this betrayal. Mike tells Rachel that he needs time to think about things, and starts living in a hotel. Mike then relented, realizing he cared greatly for her, enough to overlook the incident and he moved back in after she approached him and convinced him to do so. For the remainder of the season, Mike is in the background, doing side work, and helping solve issues as Louis Litt's deal with Forstman falls apart. Mike, through his own compassion in the final summer episode of *Suits*, \"This is Rome...\" returns Louis's possessions to his house. When there, and attempting to comfort Louis, he asks about a key he found in Louis's box of things. At first, Louis takes it as playful and dismisses him. However, after Mike asks about the key again when he failed to get Louis hired with Robert Zane, Louis is able to piece together that Mike truly isn't a Harvard graduate.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHarvey confirms this again in the series finale while arguing about Louis with special master Faye Richardson, telling her that she took \"the best lawyer in this firm\" and stripped him of his dignity.\n\n\nHe has been rightfully suspicious of Mike Ross' status as a Harvard graduate since he was hired, especially when he found out that Mike does not have file in Harvard archive .
