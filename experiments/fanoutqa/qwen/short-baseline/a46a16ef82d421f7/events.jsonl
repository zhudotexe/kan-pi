They also have limited natural resources. As a result, they have adopted special economic policies, typically involving low levels of taxation and few restrictions on external financial investment. Malta is a full member of the European Union, while the other five European microstates have obtained special relations with the European Union. Many of the microstates have also entered into a customs union with their larger neighbours to improve their economic situation (Vatican City and San Marino with Italy, Liechtenstein with Switzerland, Monaco with France). Most of them lack clearly marked borders; for example, Monaco forms a continuous metropolitan area with its neighbouring French communes (the largest being Beausoleil) and has many streets running across or along the border.\n\n\n\n## Similar entities\n\n[edit]\n\n### Dependencies\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Article from *The Economist*, 24 December 2005, \"Castles in the Air\"\n* GlobaLex, \"The Micro-States and Small Jurisdictions of Europe\"\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nEurope articles\n |\n| --- |\n| History | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Chronology | * Bibliography of European history\n* Prehistory\n* Classical antiquity\n* Late antiquity\n* Middle Ages\n* Early modernity\n* World War I\n* World War II\n* Pax Europaea\n* Crisis situations and unrest since 2000\n* COVID-19 pandemic and Deltacron hybrid variant (2020-22)\n* Russian invasion of Ukraine\n |\n| By topic | * Military\n* Sovereignty\n\t+ predecessor states\n |\n\n |\n| Geography | \n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * Areas and populations\n* Countries by area\n\t+ European microstates\n* Largest metropolitan areas\n* Cities\n* Climate\n* Climate change\n* Extreme points\n* Geology\n* Islands\n* Lakes\n* Mountains\n* Regions\n* Rivers\n* Sovereign states and dependent territories\n\t+ by population\n* Villages\n |\n\n |\n| Politics | \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Arms | Flag | Microstate\n | Capital city\n | Area (km2/sqmi)\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![Andorra](image) | ![Andorra](image) | **Andorra** – Principality of Andorra | Andorra la Vella | 468 km2 (181 sq mi)\n | The Principality of Andorra used to be a feudal remnant high in the Pyrenees, a fiefdom held jointly by the Bishop of Urgell in Spain and the Count of Foix in France, with a population of approximately 89,000.

According to the qualitative definition suggested by Zbigniew Dumieński (2014), microstates can also be viewed as \"modern protected states, i.e. sovereign states that have been able to unilaterally depute certain attributes of sovereignty to larger powers in exchange for benign protection of their political and economic viability against their geographic or demographic constraints.\"[2] In line with this definition, only Andorra, Liechtenstein, Monaco, and San Marino qualify as \"microstates\" as only these states are sovereignties functioning in close, but voluntary, association with their respective larger neighbours. Luxembourg, which is much larger than all the European microstates combined, nonetheless shares some of these characteristics.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## List of states often labelled as microstates\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWhile the microstates have sovereignty over their own territory, there are also a number of small autonomous territories, which despite having (in almost all cases) their own independent government, executive branch, legislature, judiciary, police, and other trappings of independence, are nonetheless under the sovereignty of another state or monarch.\n\n\n\n* Akrotiri and Dhekelia (British Overseas Territory)\n* Åland (autonomous county of Finland)\n* Bailiwick of Guernsey (British Crown Dependency), a part of the Channel Islands, consisting of three separate sub-jurisdictions: Alderney, Guernsey, and Sark\n* Bailiwick of Jersey (British Crown Dependency), a part of the Channel Islands\n* Faroe Islands (self-governing territory of the Kingdom of Denmark)\n* Gibraltar (British Overseas Territory)\n* Isle of Man (British Crown Dependency)\n* Mount Athos (autonomous monastic community in Greece)\n\n\n### Sovereign Military Order of Malta\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * Eurosphere\n* International organisations\n* Integration\n* Law\n* Post-Soviet Europe\n* Transatlantic relations\n |\n| Intergovernmental | * Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)\n* Council of Europe (CoE)\n* Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO)\n* Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU)\n* European Political Community (EPC)\n* GUAM Organization\n* Open Balkan\n* North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO)\n* Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE)\n\t+ statistics\n* Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation\n |\n| European Union | * Economy\n\t+ relations\n\t+ free trade agreements\n* Education\n* European Economic Area (EEA)\n* European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP)\n\t+ Eastern Partnership\n\t+ Euronest Parliamentary Assembly\n* European Union Customs Union (EUCU)\n* Eurozone\n* Foreign relations\n* Members\n\t+ enlargement\n* Politics\n* Schengen Area\n\t+ Visa policy\n* Statistics\n |\n\n |\n\n |\n| Economy | \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n## Historical small territories\n\n[edit]\n\nThe wars of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars caused the European map to be redrawn several times.

The situation was not stabilised until after the Congress of Vienna in 1815.

It gained independence from the United Kingdom as a Commonwealth realm in 1964, and became a republic in 1974.

They also have limited natural resources. As a result, they have adopted special economic policies, typically involving low levels of taxation and few restrictions on external financial investment. Malta is a full member of the European Union, while the other five European microstates have obtained special relations with the European Union. Many of the microstates have also entered into a customs union with their larger neighbours to improve their economic situation (Vatican City and San Marino with Italy, Liechtenstein with Switzerland, Monaco with France). Most of them lack clearly marked borders; for example, Monaco forms a continuous metropolitan area with its neighbouring French communes (the largest being Beausoleil) and has many streets running across or along the border.\n\n\n\n## Similar entities\n\n[edit]\n\n### Dependencies\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Article from *The Economist*, 24 December 2005, \"Castles in the Air\"\n* GlobaLex, \"The Micro-States and Small Jurisdictions of Europe\"\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nEurope articles\n |\n| --- |\n| History | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Chronology | * Bibliography of European history\n* Prehistory\n* Classical antiquity\n* Late antiquity\n* Middle Ages\n* Early modernity\n* World War I\n* World War II\n* Pax Europaea\n* Crisis situations and unrest since 2000\n* COVID-19 pandemic and Deltacron hybrid variant (2020-22)\n* Russian invasion of Ukraine\n |\n| By topic | * Military\n* Sovereignty\n\t+ predecessor states\n |\n\n |\n| Geography | \n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * Areas and populations\n* Countries by area\n\t+ European microstates\n* Largest metropolitan areas\n* Cities\n* Climate\n* Climate change\n* Extreme points\n* Geology\n* Islands\n* Lakes\n* Mountains\n* Regions\n* Rivers\n* Sovereign states and dependent territories\n\t+ by population\n* Villages\n |\n\n |\n| Politics | \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Arms | Flag | Microstate\n | Capital city\n | Area (km2/sqmi)\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![Andorra](image) | ![Andorra](image) | **Andorra** – Principality of Andorra | Andorra la Vella | 468 km2 (181 sq mi)\n | The Principality of Andorra used to be a feudal remnant high in the Pyrenees, a fiefdom held jointly by the Bishop of Urgell in Spain and the Count of Foix in France, with a population of approximately 89,000.

According to the qualitative definition suggested by Zbigniew Dumieński (2014), microstates can also be viewed as \"modern protected states, i.e. sovereign states that have been able to unilaterally depute certain attributes of sovereignty to larger powers in exchange for benign protection of their political and economic viability against their geographic or demographic constraints.\"[2] In line with this definition, only Andorra, Liechtenstein, Monaco, and San Marino qualify as \"microstates\" as only these states are sovereignties functioning in close, but voluntary, association with their respective larger neighbours. Luxembourg, which is much larger than all the European microstates combined, nonetheless shares some of these characteristics.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## List of states often labelled as microstates\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWhile the microstates have sovereignty over their own territory, there are also a number of small autonomous territories, which despite having (in almost all cases) their own independent government, executive branch, legislature, judiciary, police, and other trappings of independence, are nonetheless under the sovereignty of another state or monarch.\n\n\n\n* Akrotiri and Dhekelia (British Overseas Territory)\n* Åland (autonomous county of Finland)\n* Bailiwick of Guernsey (British Crown Dependency), a part of the Channel Islands, consisting of three separate sub-jurisdictions: Alderney, Guernsey, and Sark\n* Bailiwick of Jersey (British Crown Dependency), a part of the Channel Islands\n* Faroe Islands (self-governing territory of the Kingdom of Denmark)\n* Gibraltar (British Overseas Territory)\n* Isle of Man (British Crown Dependency)\n* Mount Athos (autonomous monastic community in Greece)\n\n\n### Sovereign Military Order of Malta\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * Eurosphere\n* International organisations\n* Integration\n* Law\n* Post-Soviet Europe\n* Transatlantic relations\n |\n| Intergovernmental | * Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)\n* Council of Europe (CoE)\n* Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO)\n* Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU)\n* European Political Community (EPC)\n* GUAM Organization\n* Open Balkan\n* North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO)\n* Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE)\n\t+ statistics\n* Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation\n |\n| European Union | * Economy\n\t+ relations\n\t+ free trade agreements\n* Education\n* European Economic Area (EEA)\n* European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP)\n\t+ Eastern Partnership\n\t+ Euronest Parliamentary Assembly\n* European Union Customs Union (EUCU)\n* Eurozone\n* Foreign relations\n* Members\n\t+ enlargement\n* Politics\n* Schengen Area\n\t+ Visa policy\n* Statistics\n |\n\n |\n\n |\n| Economy | \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n## Historical small territories\n\n[edit]\n\nThe wars of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars caused the European map to be redrawn several times. A number of short-lived client republics were created, and the fall of the Holy Roman Empire gave sovereignty to each of its many surviving *Kleinstaaten*. The situation was not stabilised until after the Congress of Vienna in 1815. Following World War I and World War II a number of territories gained temporary status as international zones, protectorates or occupied territories. A few of them are mentioned here:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | The Republic of Malta is an archipelago of seven islands in the central Mediterranean Sea and has a population of around 446,000 (2013 estimate),[4] meaning it has a larger population than several non-microstates, notably Iceland which has a population of around 325,000 (2014 estimate).[5] People first arrived about 5200 BC from the nearby island of Sicily. It gained independence from the United Kingdom as a Commonwealth realm in 1964, and became a republic in 1974. Malta is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations and the only microstate to be a full member of the European Union.
