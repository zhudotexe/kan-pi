In order to qualify for this list, a structure must:\n\n\n\n* be a recognisable building;\n* incorporate features of building work from the claimed date to at least 1.5 metres (4.9 ft) in height;\n* be largely complete or include building work to this height for most of its perimeter.\n* contain an enclosed area with at least one entry point.\n\n\nThis deliberately excludes ruins of limited height and statues.

Occupation sites with older human made structures such as those in Göbekli Tepe do exist, but the structures are monuments and do not meet the definition of building (which can be seen above). Many of the buildings within the list contain primarily bricks, but most importantly maintain their walls and roof. There are numerous extant structures that survive in the Orkney islands of Scotland, some of the best known of which are part of the Heart of Neolithic Orkney World Heritage Site.[2] The list also contains many large buildings from the Egyptian Age of the Pyramids.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Aula Palatina | ![](image) | Germany | 306 AD\n | Palace basilica\n | Contains the largest extant hall from antiquity.[125] |\n| Jokhang | ![](image) | Lhasa, Tibet, China | c. 639 AD\n | Buddhist temple\n | Perhaps the world's oldest timber-frame building.[135] |\n| Hōryū-ji | ![](image) | Nara, Japan | 670 AD\n | Buddhist Temple\n | Oldest wooden building still standing.[136] |\n| Nanchan Temple | ![](image) | Wutai, China | 782 AD\n | Buddhist Temple\n | Its Great Buddha Hall is currently China's oldest extant timber building.\n |\n| Greensted Church | ![](image) | United Kingdom (England)\n | c. 1053 AD\n | Church\n | May be the oldest, extant wooden church in the world and the oldest, extant wooden building in Europe.[137][138] |\n| Roykstovan in Kirkjubø | ![](image) | Faroe Islands | No clear date, middle of 11th century AD\n | Farmhouse\n | May be the oldest continuously inhabited wooden building in the world[139] |\n| Ditherington Flax Mill | ![](image) | United Kingdom (England, Shrewsbury)\n | 1797 AD\n | Industrial\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Building\n | Image\n | Country\n | Continent\n | First Built\n | Use\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Göbeklitepe | ![](image) | Turkey | Asia | 9500-7500 BC\n | Unknown/likely temple\n | Oldest temple and oldest structure in the world.\n |\n| Durankulak | ![](image) | Bulgaria | Europe | 5500—4100 BC\n | Settlement\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n131. **^** \"Oldest Hindu Temple Discovered | OBORGE\".
