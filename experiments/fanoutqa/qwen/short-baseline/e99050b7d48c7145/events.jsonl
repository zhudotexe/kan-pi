Such calculations are prepared by various organizations, including the IMF and the World Bank. As estimates and assumptions have to be made, the results produced by different organizations for the same country are not hard facts and tend to differ, sometimes substantially, so they should be used with caution.\n\n\nComparisons of national wealth are frequently made on the basis of *nominal* GDP and savings (not just income), which do not reflect differences in the cost of living in different countries (*see List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita*); hence, using a PPP basis is arguably more useful when comparing generalized differences in living standards between economies because PPP takes into account the relative cost of living and the inflation rates of the countries, rather than using only exchange rates, which may distort the real differences in income.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThere are many natural economic reasons for GDP-per-capita to vary between jurisdictions (e.g. places rich in oil and gas tend to have high GDP-per-capita figures). However, it is increasingly being recognized that tax havens, or corporate tax havens, have distorted economic data which produces artificially high, or inflated, GDP-per-capita figures.[17] It is estimated that over 15% of global jurisdictions are tax havens (see tax haven lists).[18] An IMF investigation estimates that circa 40% of global foreign direct investment flows, which heavily influence the GDP of various jurisdictions, are described as \"phantom\" transactions.[19]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* List of countries by GDP (PPP)\n* List of countries by GDP (nominal)\n* List of countries by past and projected GDP (PPP) per capita\n* List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita\n* List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita growth rate\n* List of IMF ranked countries by GDP\n* Quality of life\n* Big Mac Index\n* Government spending\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** There have been no exclusive estimates for world average by the IMF.

Such calculations are prepared by various organizations, including the IMF and the World Bank. As estimates and assumptions have to be made, the results produced by different organizations for the same country are not hard facts and tend to differ, sometimes substantially, so they should be used with caution.\n\n\nComparisons of national wealth are frequently made on the basis of *nominal* GDP and savings (not just income), which do not reflect differences in the cost of living in different countries (*see List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita*); hence, using a PPP basis is arguably more useful when comparing generalized differences in living standards between economies because PPP takes into account the relative cost of living and the inflation rates of the countries, rather than using only exchange rates, which may distort the real differences in income.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThere are many natural economic reasons for GDP-per-capita to vary between jurisdictions (e.g. places rich in oil and gas tend to have high GDP-per-capita figures). However, it is increasingly being recognized that tax havens, or corporate tax havens, have distorted economic data which produces artificially high, or inflated, GDP-per-capita figures.[17] It is estimated that over 15% of global jurisdictions are tax havens (see tax haven lists).[18] An IMF investigation estimates that circa 40% of global foreign direct investment flows, which heavily influence the GDP of various jurisdictions, are described as \"phantom\" transactions.[19]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* List of countries by GDP (PPP)\n* List of countries by GDP (nominal)\n* List of countries by past and projected GDP (PPP) per capita\n* List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita\n* List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita growth rate\n* List of IMF ranked countries by GDP\n* Quality of life\n* Big Mac Index\n* Government spending\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** There have been no exclusive estimates for world average by the IMF.
