Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. *(April 2021)*\n |\n\n\n![](image)Motor vehicles produced by country in 2013\nThis is a **list of manufacturers by motor vehicle production**, by year, based on Organisation Internationale des Constructeurs d'Automobiles (OICA).\n\n\nFigures include passenger cars, light commercial vehicles, minibuses, trucks, buses and coaches. OICA defines these entries as follows:[1]\n\n\n\n* **Passenger cars** are motor vehicles with at least four wheels, used for the transport of passengers, and comprising no more than eight seats in addition to the driver's seat.\n* **Light commercial vehicles** (**LCV**) are motor vehicles with at least four wheels, used for the carriage of goods. Mass given in tons (metric tons) is used as a limit between light commercial vehicles and heavy trucks. This limit depends on national and professional definitions, and it varies between 3.5 and 7 tons. Minibuses, derived from light commercial vehicles, are used for the transport of passengers, comprising more than eight seats in addition to the driver's seat and having a maximum mass between 3.5 and 7 tons.\n* **Heavy trucks** (**HCV**) are vehicles intended for the carriage of goods. Maximum authorised mass is over the limit (ranging from 3.5 to 7 tons) of light commercial vehicles. They include tractor vehicles designed for towing semi-trailers.\n* **Buses and coaches** are used for the transport of passengers, comprising more than eight seats in addition to the driver's seat, and having a maximum mass over the limit (ranging from 3.5 to 7 tonnes) of light commercial vehicles.\n\n\n\n## Overview[edit]\n\n\n**Motor vehicle production by manufacturer (top five groups)**\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues. There is more info on Phabricator and on MediaWiki.org.\n |\n\n\nThe summary chart includes the five largest worldwide automotive manufacturing groups as of 2017 by number of vehicles produced. Those same groups have held the top 5 positions since 2007; only Hyundai / Kia had a lower rank until it took the fifth spot in 2007 from the at that time split German-American auto manufacturer DaimlerChrysler. Figures were compiled by the International Organization of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers (OICA):\n2000, \n2001, \n2002, \n2003, \n2004, \n2005, \n2006, \n2007, \n2008, \n2009, \n2010, \n2011, \n2012, \n2013, \n2014, \n2015,\n2016,\n2017.\n\n\n\n* The Toyota group includes Daihatsu and Hino.[2][a]\n* The Volkswagen Group includes VW, Audi, SEAT, Skoda and luxury brands.[3][b]\n* The General Motors group includes GM Korea, formerly Daewoo, since 2005,[7][8] Saab until 2009[9] (sold to Spyker in January 2010),[10] SAIC-GM-Wuling until 2014,[11][12] and Opel and Vauxhall until 2016 (sold to Groupe PSA in 2017 and subsequently owned by Stellantis in 2021).[13]\n* Hyundai and Kia have operated as part of the Hyundai Motor Group since 1998.[c]\n* The Ford group includes Jaguar Land Rover 2000 to 2007[14] (sold to Tata in 2008)[15] and Volvo 1999 to 2009[16] (sold to Geely in 2010).[17]\n\n\n## 2017[edit]\n\n\nThis is a list of largest manufacturers by production in 2017.[18]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Rank

OICA listed Daihatsu (owned to 51.2% by Toyota 1998 to 2016) combined with Toyota in 1998 and 1999 and both Daihatsu and Hino (owned to 50.1% by Toyota since 2001) combined with Toyota in 2000 and again from 2008, but separately 2001 to 2007, although Toyota-Daihatsu-Hino was listed combined in the list of the largest auto manufacturers by year for the years 2001 and 2002.\n2. **^** Truck producers Scania AB and M.A.N. were included by OICA in group totals for 2011[4] and 2012,[5] then removed for the following years;[6] they are excluded from the chart for consistency.\n3. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** Hyundai and Kia have operated as a group since 1998 when Hyundai first took 51% control of Kia. However, OICA listed their manufacturing figures separately 2006 to 2008; they are combined here for consistency with previous and subsequent years.\n4. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Including production figures from the Chinese SAIC-GM-Wuling joint venture,[20] which the OICA left out from the 2015 and 2016 GM total contrary to prior practice; they are combined here to allow for consistent comparison with previous years.\n5. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** FAW production excluding joint ventures with Volkswagen, Toyota and Mazda\n6. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** Although General Motors still was the largest automaker by sales by 2007, Toyota (including Daihatsu and Hino) had larger production of vehicles a year than G.M. for the first time already in 2006.\n7. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** ***k*** ***l*** ***m*** ***n*** Ford owned a 33.4 % controlling-stake in Mazda 1996 to 2008. OICA, however, lists Mazda separately from Ford. Including Mazda's production, Ford would still be the 2nd-largest auto manufacturer, larger than Toyota (with Daihatsu and Hino), both in 2003 and 2004, as well as the 3rd largest, larger than the Volkswagen Group, in 2007 (and possibly the first half of 2008).\n8. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** Including production figures from Nissan Diesel as a Nissan subsidiary until 2006 (sold to Volvo in 2007).\n9. ^ ***a*** ***b*** DaimlerChrysler was split in 2007. However, OICA began to list them separately already in 2006.\n10. **^** With Mazda: 7,785,307\n11. **^** Dongfeng production excluding joint venture with Citroën\n12. **^** BAIC production excluding joint ventures with Hyundai and Isuzu\n13. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** GM Daewoo became a subsidiary of General Motors in 2002. OICA, however, listed it separately 2002 to 2004, then combined with GM since 2005.\n14. **^** With Mazda: 7,919,104\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Definitions\" (PDF). OICA.

OICA defines these entries as follows:[1]\n\n\n\n* **Passenger cars** are motor vehicles with at least four wheels, used for the transport of passengers, and comprising no more than eight seats in addition to the driver's seat.\n* **Light commercial vehicles** (**LCV**) are motor vehicles with at least four wheels, used for the carriage of goods. Mass given in tons (metric tons) is used as a limit between light commercial vehicles and heavy trucks. This limit depends on national and professional definitions, and it varies between 3.5 and 7 tons. Minibuses, derived from light commercial vehicles, are used for the transport of passengers, comprising more than eight seats in addition to the driver's seat and having a maximum mass between 3.5 and 7 tons.\n* **Heavy trucks** (**HCV**) are vehicles intended for the carriage of goods. Maximum authorised mass is over the limit (ranging from 3.5 to 7 tons) of light commercial vehicles. They include tractor vehicles designed for towing semi-trailers.\n* **Buses and coaches** are used for the transport of passengers, comprising more than eight seats in addition to the driver's seat, and having a maximum mass over the limit (ranging from 3.5 to 7 tonnes) of light commercial vehicles.\n\n\n\n## Overview[edit]\n\n\n**Motor vehicle production by manufacturer (top five groups)**\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues. There is more info on Phabricator and on MediaWiki.org.\n |\n\n\nThe summary chart includes the five largest worldwide automotive manufacturing groups as of 2017 by number of vehicles produced. Those same groups have held the top 5 positions since 2007; only Hyundai / Kia had a lower rank until it took the fifth spot in 2007 from the at that time split German-American auto manufacturer DaimlerChrysler. Figures were compiled by the International Organization of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers (OICA):\n2000, \n2001, \n2002, \n2003, \n2004, \n2005, \n2006, \n2007, \n2008, \n2009, \n2010, \n2011, \n2012, \n2013, \n2014, \n2015,\n2016,\n2017.\n\n\n\n* The Toyota group includes Daihatsu and Hino.[2][a]\n* The Volkswagen Group includes VW, Audi, SEAT, Skoda and luxury brands.[3][b]\n* The General Motors group includes GM Korea, formerly Daewoo, since 2005,[7][8] Saab until 2009[9] (sold to Spyker in January 2010),[10] SAIC-GM-Wuling until 2014,[11][12] and Opel and Vauxhall until 2016 (sold to Groupe PSA in 2017 and subsequently owned by Stellantis in 2021).[13]\n* Hyundai and Kia have operated as part of the Hyundai Motor Group since 1998.[c]\n* The Ford group includes Jaguar Land Rover 2000 to 2007[14] (sold to Tata in 2008)[15] and Volvo 1999 to 2009[16] (sold to Geely in 2010).[17]\n\n\n## 2017[edit]\n\n\nThis is a list of largest manufacturers by production in 2017.[18]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Rank

However, OICA listed their manufacturing figures separately 2006 to 2008; they are combined here for consistency with previous and subsequent years.\n4. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Including production figures from the Chinese SAIC-GM-Wuling joint venture,[20] which the OICA left out from the 2015 and 2016 GM total contrary to prior practice; they are combined here to allow for consistent comparison with previous years.\n5. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** FAW production excluding joint ventures with Volkswagen, Toyota and Mazda\n6. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** Although General Motors still was the largest automaker by sales by 2007, Toyota (including Daihatsu and Hino) had larger production of vehicles a year than G.M. for the first time already in 2006.\n7. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** ***k*** ***l*** ***m*** ***n*** Ford owned a 33.4 % controlling-stake in Mazda 1996 to 2008. OICA, however, lists Mazda separately from Ford. Including Mazda's production, Ford would still be the 2nd-largest auto manufacturer, larger than Toyota (with Daihatsu and Hino), both in 2003 and 2004, as well as the 3rd largest, larger than the Volkswagen Group, in 2007 (and possibly the first half of 2008).\n8. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** Including production figures from Nissan Diesel as a Nissan subsidiary until 2006 (sold to Volvo in 2007).\n9. ^ ***a*** ***b*** DaimlerChrysler was split in 2007.
