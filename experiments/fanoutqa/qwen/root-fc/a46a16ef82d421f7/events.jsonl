However, many other languages are also used by institutions situated within the state, such as the Holy See and the Swiss Guard, as well as personally by its diverse population.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nDuring the Roman Empire, Latin was the language spoken in the area corresponding to the present Vatican City. The subsequent Papal States also used Latin for official purposes during the first centuries of their existence. In 1870 the area became part of the Kingdom of Italy, whose official language was Italian.\n\n\nIn 1929 the Lateran Treaty established Vatican City as an independent state. The Fundamental Law of Vatican City State does not establish an official language, but its laws are published in Italian in a supplement to the *Acta Apostolicae Sedis* (official gazette of the Holy See), which is mainly in Latin.\n\n\nSince the state came into existence in 1929, most of the buildings situated within it predated it by centuries. Inscriptions can be found in them mainly in Latin, but also in Italian, Greek, French and German.[1][*better source needed*]\n\n\n\n## Present languages[edit]\n\n\nMany languages are spoken within the state, as its inhabitants come from many countries. Italian is the lingua franca of the Vatican and replaced Latin as the official language of the Synod of Bishops in 2014.[2] The Holy See, the entity with authority over the state (yet legally distinct), uses Latin as its official language and Italian as its main working language in administrative and diplomatic affairs. French is also sometimes used as a diplomatic language. In the Swiss Guard, Swiss German is the language used for giving commands, but the individual guards take their oath of loyalty in their own languages: German, French, Italian or Romansh.\n\n\nSince the state was established, the native languages of the popes have been Italian, German, Polish and Spanish.\n\n\n\n## Websites[edit]\n\n\nThe official website of Vatican City is in Italian.[3] Previous versions of the website were also available in English, French, German and Spanish.[4]\n\n\nThe official website of the Holy See is primarily in Italian, with versions in English, French, German, Portuguese and Spanish, and partial versions in Arabic, Chinese and Latin.[5] Some content is also available in many other languages, such as Albanian, Belarusian, Croatian, Czech, Dutch, Hebrew, Hungarian, Indonesian, Japanese, Korean, Lithuanian, Maltese, Polish, Russian, Slovak, Slovene, Swahili and Ukrainian.[6][7]\n\n\nThe Holy See's newspaper *L'Osservatore Romano* is published in Italian, English, French, German, Polish, Portuguese and Spanish.[8] The Vatican News website is available in many languages: Albanian, Amharic, Arabic, Armenian, Belarusian, Bulgarian, Chinese, Croatian, Czech, English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Latvian, Lithuanian, Hindi, Hungarian, Malayalam, Macedonian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Slovak, Slovene, Spanish, Swahili, Swedish, Tamil, Tigrinya, Ukrainian and Vietnamese.[9]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Vatican City portal\n* ![icon](image)Languages portal\n\n\n* Index of Vatican City-related articles\n* Ecclesiastical Latin, the form of Latin used by the Church in its documents.\n* Romanesco, the vernacular spoken in Rome around the Vatican City.\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Camposanto Teutonico\n2. **^** Peri, Claudio (October 6, 2014). \"Pope ditches Latin as official language of Vatican synod\".

Italian nationals make up 19% of the total population.[1]\n\n\nItalian was the ancestral language of the ruling House of Grimaldi, and was the official language of Monaco until 1860, when it was replaced by French.[2] This was due to the annexation of the surrounding County of Nice to France following the Treaty of Turin (1860).[2]\n\n\nItalian is also spoken by Caroline, Princess of Hanover and her children Andrea Casiraghi, Charlotte Casiraghi and Pierre Casiraghi, as her late husband was Italian.[3]\n\n\n\n## English[edit]\n\n\nThere is also an Anglophone community in Monaco (8.5% of which are from the United Kingdom or the United States, with English-speakers from other nations as too insignificant and thus listed within the category of \"other,\" below),[1] in addition to English-speaking tourists visiting the city.\n\n\nPrincess Grace was born an American, and all three of her children (including the reigning Prince) grew up speaking English among other languages.[4] The current princess consort of Monaco, Princess Charlene, is a native English speaker, having been born a Rhodesian in what is now Zimbabwe.\n\n\n\n## Occitan[edit]\n\n\nOccitan (*Lenga d'òc*) has also traditionally been spoken in Monaco, particularly when it covered a larger geographical territory, but is rarely used today.\n\n\n\n## Other[edit]\n\n\nIntemelio is a Ligurian dialect spoken historically from the Principality of Monaco to the Italian province of Imperia.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Outline of Monaco\n* History of Monaco\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Monaco IQ (English language), referencing Chapter One of Files and Reports&InfoSujet=General Population Census 2008&6Gb|2008 census (gouv.mc not an English source) Archived 27 September 2011 at the Wayback Machine\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Il monegasco, una lingua che si studia a scuola ed è obbligatoria\" (in Italian).
