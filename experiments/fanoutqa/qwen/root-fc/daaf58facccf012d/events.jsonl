With over 253 million subscribers as of November 2023, the channel has held the top position since April 14, 2019.[5][6] The most-subscribed channel which is not 'branded' (i.e., does not belong to an organization or company) is that of American YouTuber MrBeast, who is the second most-subscribed channel overall, with over 211 million subscribers as of November 2023.[6]\n\n\n\n\n## 50 most-subscribed channels[edit]\n\n\nThe following table lists the 50 most-subscribed YouTube channels,[A][6] as well as the primary language and content category of each channel. The channels are ordered by number of subscribers. Those whose displayed subscriber counts are identical, are listed so that the channel whose current growth rate indicates that its displayed subscriber count will exceed that of the other channel is listed first. Automatically generated channels that lack their own videos, such as Music and News, and channels that have been made effectively obsolete as a result of the transferral of their content, such as JustinBieberVEVO and TaylorSwiftVEVO[B] are excluded. \n\n\nAs of November 2023, 20 of the 50 channels listed primarily produce content in English while 17 primarily produce content in Hindi. All 50 channels have surpassed 45 million subscribers, 41 of them have surpassed 50 million subscribers, 27 of them have surpassed 60 million subscribers, 19 of them have surpassed 70 million subscribers, 14 of them have surpassed 80 million subscribers, 12 of them have surpassed 90 million and 9 of them have surpassed 100 million subscribers.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Rank\n | Name\n | Link\n | Brand

During the competition, both channels gained a large number of subscribers at a rapid rate, and surpassed each other's subscriber count on multiple occasions in February, March, and April 2019.[52][53][54][56] T-Series eventually permanently surpassed PewDiePie, and on May 29, 2019 it became the first channel to reach 100 million subscribers.[72]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Internet portal\n* ![](image)Lists portal\n\n\n* List of most-viewed YouTube channels\n* List of most-viewed YouTube videos\n* List of most-liked YouTube videos\n* List of most-disliked YouTube videos\n* List of YouTubers\n* List of most-viewed Indian YouTube videos\n* List of most-viewed Pakistani YouTube videos\n* List of most-viewed Arabic music videos on YouTube\n* List of most-viewed French music videos on YouTube\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The total number of channels listed may exceed 50 if a tie exists for the 50th-highest subscriber count.\n2. **^** These are not to be mistaken for the channels Justin Bieber and Taylor Swift, both of which are included.\n3. **^** Although now called simply \"YouTube\", YouTube's official channel was named \"YouTube Spotlight\" in 2013.\n4. **^** T-Series surpassed PewDiePie in subscriber count on numerous occasions, each lasting fewer than 24 hours, from February to late March 2019.[52][53][54] The first incident to last at least 24 hours began on March 27 and ended on April 1.[55][56]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"The Quickstart Guide to YouTube – Lesson 2: YouTube Basics\". *YouTube Creator Academy*.

You can help by adding missing items with reliable sources.\n\n![](image)\nIndian record label T-Series is the most-subscribed channel, with over 253 million subscribers as of November 2023.[update]\n![](image)\nAmerican YouTube personality MrBeast is the most-subscribed individual and second most-subscribed channel overall, with 211 million subscribers as of November 2023.[update]\n\nA subscriber to a channel on the American video-sharing platform YouTube is a user who has chosen to receive the channel's content by clicking on that channel's \"Subscribe\" button, and each user's subscription feed consists of videos published by channels to which the user is subscribed.[1] The ability to subscribe to users was introduced in October 2005.[2] YouTube began publishing a list of its most-subscribed channels in April 2006.[3] An early archive of the list dates to May 2006.[4]\n\n\nSince mid-2006, when Smosh occupied the top position with less than 3,000 subscribers,[4] at least 10 other YouTube channels have held the top spot; these include American fictional character Bree Avery, American comedian Brooke \"Brookers\" Brodack, American fictional character Fred Figglehorn, Swedish gamer Felix \"PewDiePie\" Kjellberg, American comedian Ryan Higa, American media personality Ray William Johnson, American public speaker Judson Laipply, and English geriatric Peter Oakley.\n\n\nThe most-subscribed channel is the Indian record label T-Series, which hosts its music videos on its channel. With over 253 million subscribers as of November 2023, the channel has held the top position since April 14, 2019.[5][6] The most-subscribed channel which is not 'branded' (i.e., does not belong to an organization or company) is that of American YouTuber MrBeast, who is the second most-subscribed channel overall, with over 211 million subscribers as of November 2023.[6]\n\n\n\n\n## 50 most-subscribed channels[edit]\n\n\nThe following table lists the 50 most-subscribed YouTube channels,[A][6] as well as the primary language and content category of each channel. The channels are ordered by number of subscribers. Those whose displayed subscriber counts are identical, are listed so that the channel whose current growth rate indicates that its displayed subscriber count will exceed that of the other channel is listed first. Automatically generated channels that lack their own videos, such as Music and News, and channels that have been made effectively obsolete as a result of the transferral of their content, such as JustinBieberVEVO and TaylorSwiftVEVO[B] are excluded. \n\n\nAs of November 2023, 20 of the 50 channels listed primarily produce content in English while 17 primarily produce content in Hindi. All 50 channels have surpassed 45 million subscribers, 41 of them have surpassed 50 million subscribers, 27 of them have surpassed 60 million subscribers, 19 of them have surpassed 70 million subscribers, 14 of them have surpassed 80 million subscribers, 12 of them have surpassed 90 million and 9 of them have surpassed 100 million subscribers.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Rank\n | Name\n | Link\n | Brand

During the competition, both channels gained a large number of subscribers at a rapid rate, and surpassed each other's subscriber count on multiple occasions in February, March, and April 2019.[52][53][54][56] T-Series eventually permanently surpassed PewDiePie, and on May 29, 2019 it became the first channel to reach 100 million subscribers.[72]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Internet portal\n* ![](image)Lists portal\n\n\n* List of most-viewed YouTube channels\n* List of most-viewed YouTube videos\n* List of most-liked YouTube videos\n* List of most-disliked YouTube videos\n* List of YouTubers\n* List of most-viewed Indian YouTube videos\n* List of most-viewed Pakistani YouTube videos\n* List of most-viewed Arabic music videos on YouTube\n* List of most-viewed French music videos on YouTube\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The total number of channels listed may exceed 50 if a tie exists for the 50th-highest subscriber count.\n2. **^** These are not to be mistaken for the channels Justin Bieber and Taylor Swift, both of which are included.\n3. **^** Although now called simply \"YouTube\", YouTube's official channel was named \"YouTube Spotlight\" in 2013.\n4. **^** T-Series surpassed PewDiePie in subscriber count on numerous occasions, each lasting fewer than 24 hours, from February to late March 2019.[52][53][54] The first incident to last at least 24 hours began on March 27 and ended on April 1.[55][56]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"The Quickstart Guide to YouTube – Lesson 2: YouTube Basics\". *YouTube Creator Academy*.
