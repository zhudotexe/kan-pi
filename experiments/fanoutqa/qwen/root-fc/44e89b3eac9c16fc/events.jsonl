Dark and Steel types fare well against \"Psychic\" attacks, which was a dominant type in *Red* and *Blue*. The concept of breeding was introduced in the second generation of *Pokémon* games as well, which allows players to manipulate the skills of their Pokémon to a greater degree.[1] Some of the new Pokémon introduced in *Gold* and *Silver* are pre-evolutions of other Pokémon, such as Pichu and Igglybuff. These baby Pokémon are only available by breeding their evolved forms.\n\n\n*Pokémon Gold* and *Silver* were first revealed at Nintendo Space World in 1997. At this point, the game had a massively larger world map than the final game and this prototype featured around 40 Pokémon designs that were removed and replaced when the games were released in 1999.[2]\n\n\n\n\n## List of Pokémon[edit]\n\n\nPokémon\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Details on Pokémon names, National Pokédex numbers, types and evolutions are obtained from The Pokémon Company International's online Pokédex.[3]\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** Prior to *X* and *Y*, Cleffa, Igglybuff, Togepi, Snubbull and Granbull were pure Normal types, while Togetic was Normal/Flying.\n3. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Starting in *X* and *Y*, Marill and Azumarill gained the Fairy type.\n4. **^** Paldean Wooper (introduced in *Pokémon Scarlet* and *Violet*) are capable of evolving into Clodsire.\n5. **^** Only Galarian Corsola (introduced in *Pokémon Sword* and *Shield*) are capable of evolving into Cursola.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nList of Pokémon species introduced in Generation II (1999)[nb 1]\n| Name\n | National Pokédexnumber\n | Type(s) | Evolves from\n | Evolves into\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| English\n | Japanese\n | Primary\n | Secondary\n |\n| Chikorita\n | *Chikorita* (チコリータ)[4] | 0152 | Grass\n | Beginning of evolution\n | Bayleef (#153) | A small quadrupedal green Pokémon with a large lime green leaf on its head.

However, Shudo intended Lugia as a creature that was simultaneously male and female. This dual nature was intended to embody one of the film's main messages, that people can be different and yet coexist without resorting to conflict. He showed \"overwhelming regret that he allowed Lugia to be voiced by a man\", considering Lugia, the \"creator of all life on Earth\", to be a \"maternal Pokémon\". \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | Beginning of evolution\n | Wyrdeer (#899) | Its large antlers create a curved flow of space where reality is distorted.

Slowking debuted in the second movie, where it spoke.\n |\n| Misdreavus\n | *Mūma* (ムウマ)[14] | 0200 | Ghost | Beginning of evolution\n | Mismagius (#429) | It loves to startle people at night with screams and wails. Apparently the fear gets absorbed by the Red orbs around its neck as food. It will get physical, yanking hair and biting people just to see their reaction. If you put your ear up to the Red orbs, you can hear shrieking. It does not get along with people who do not get frightened. It seems that Flutter mane is an ancient relative of it.\n |\n| Unown | *Unown* (アンノーン)[33] | 0201 | Psychic\n | No evolution\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | Farigiraf (#981) | It is a giraffe-esque Pokémon. Its rear end has an organ in its head acting as a small brain. It can smell and bite you so watch out. It does not need to sleep either so it can stay on guard all night. Girafarig uses its tail to emit psychic power to drive away enemies when it is in danger, and it can even fight while backwards. Its original design was more akin to a Pushmi-pullyu.\n |\n| Pineco\n | *Kunugidama* (クヌギダマ)[13] | 0204 | Bug\n | Beginning of evolution\n | Forretress (#205) | It attaches its head to the branch of a tree. If something like the wind knocks it off while eating, it will explode, so be careful. It appears as a pinecone like Pokémon.\n |\n| Forretress\n | *Foretosu* (フォレトス)[13] | 0205 | Bug\n | Steel\n | Pineco (#204) | End of evolution\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | Donphan (#232) | It digs a vertical nest in the ground, and uses its trunk to mark its territory. It is based on the elephant. Phanpy like to spray water on themselves and others with their trunk.\n |\n| Donphan\n | *Donphan* (ドンファン)[34] | 0232 | Ground\n | Phanpy (#231) | End of evolution\n | It uses its armored trunk to roll around and slam into its foes. Donphan is capable lifting objects twice its own weight. It appears as a mix between an elephant and a tire. Ash once got a Phanpy that hatched out of an egg in the anime, which then evolved into a Donphan in Hoenn. It debuted in *Pokémon: The First Movie*.\n |\n| Porygon2\n | *Porygon 2* (ポリゴン2)[13] | 0233 | Normal\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | Furret are nimble, quick, and known for slipping through small spaces due to its small size and nimble feet. It is hard to tell where the front ends and the bottom begins. It is based on the real-life ferret.\n |\n| Hoothoot\n | *Hōhō* (ホーホー)[13] | 0163 | Normal\n | Flying\n | Beginning of evolution\n | Noctowl (#164) | Hoothoot will always hoot at the same time everyday due to its internal organ that can sense the Earth's rotation. Hoothoots have two legs but are almost always seen standing on one. They switch out which legs they stand on faster than the eye can process it. It debuted first in the *Pikachu's Rescue Adventure* short before the second movie.\n |\n| Noctowl\n | *Yorunozuku* (ヨルノズク)[13] | 0164 | Normal\n | Flying\n | Hoothoot (#163) | End of evolution\n | It will never fail to catch its prey at night due to its soft and quiet wings, and its impeccable night vision. Its English name is a portmanteau of \"nocturnal\" and \"owl\". Ash has a shiny Noctowl in the anime.\n |\n| Ledyba\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | Wobbuffet is a blue Pokémon resemblant of a punching bag. It lives in dark places to hide its black tail. Since it hates light and shock, it puffs up its body to repel it. It is never the first to attack. If its black tail is attacked though, it will viciously attack back or take its foe with them by using Destiny Bond. When two of them meet, they might try to see which one can go the longest without food. Trainers need to beware of this habit. It desperately tries to keep its tail hidden, it may have a secret. The most famous Wobbuffet is Jessie from Team Rocket's Wobbuffet in the anime, who serves as comic relief.\n |\n| Girafarig\n | *Kirinriki* (キリンリキ)[13] | 0203 | Normal\n | Psychic\n | Beginning of evolution\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | Clefairy (#035) | On nights that have many shooting stars, Cleffa can be found dancing through the night. It will dance until daybreak where it sips on the morning dew. It evolves into Clefairy at high-enough friendship levels.\n |\n| Igglybuff\n | *Pupurin* (ププリン)[20] | 0174 | Normal\n | Fairy[nb 2] | Beginning of evolution\n | Jigglypuff (#039) | Its vocal cords are not fully developed yet, so it hurts to use them. It gargles fresh water from streams to replenish them. Igglybuff's body is very bouncy, so if it bounces, there is no stopping it. In the English-dubbed anime, it was voiced by Rachael Lillis, who also voiced Jigglypuff and Wigglytuff. It evolves into Jigglypuff at high-enough friendship levels.\n |\n| Togepi\n | *Togepi* (トゲピー)[21] | 0175 | Fairy[nb 2] | Beginning of evolution\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | Porygon (#137) | Porygon-Z (#474) | Porygon2 is an upgraded version of Porygon. It evolved due to a bizarre item. It was updated with the new ability to freely explore space, and even though it does not die in the vacuum of space, it cannot really move around well. Though it now exhibits new expressions and actions, it cannot only learn new things on its own, even things it should not learn, it also developed a language only understood by other Porygon2. It evolves by holding an Up-grade. It never made any appearances in the anime after the events of \"Denno Senshi Porygon\", with the exception of a very brief cameo in the intro scene of the fifteenth movie, *Kyurem vs. the Sword of Justice*. It is the only Pokémon with a number in its name and one of only two Pokémon (outside of Generation VIII) that never appeared in the anime, the other being its evolution, Porygon-Z. In its earliest design, Porygon2 resembled a rounded lion.\n |\n| Stantler\n | *Odoshishi* (オドシシ)[31] | 0234 | Normal\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n41. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Dr Lava (2019-12-27). \"Pokemon's Head Writer: Used Booze & Pills to Fuel Writing Process\". *Lava Cut Content*.

Mareanie (introduced in *Sun & Moon*) loves to eat Corsola's coral branches as a snack and it actively chases them down just for their branches. Its Galarian form is a Ghost type. The Galarian form, being Ghost type with a white coloration, is speculated to be a reference to coral bleaching, which is an environmental issue that marks the death of corals which has been caused by global warming. Misty caught a Corsola in the Whirl Islands in the anime.\n |\n| Remoraid\n | *Teppouo* (テッポウオ)[13] | 0223 | Water\n | Beginning of evolution\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | *Wooper* (ウパー)[20] | 0194 | Water\n | Ground\n | Beginning of evolution\n | Quagsire (#195)[nb 4] | Wooper usually lives in water, however it occasionally comes out onto land in search of food. On land, it coats its body with a gooey, toxic film. Wooper appears as a blue, armless creature that have two antennae/feelers on the side of their heads, two feet, and a tail.\n |\n| Quagsire\n | *Nuō* (ヌオー)[13] | 0195 | Water\n | Ground\n | Wooper (#194) | End of evolution\n | If Quagsire gets hurt in any way, it will not feel a thing due to its low intelligence. To hunt, it sits in the water waiting for food to just pass by. It does not move much so it does not get hungry as often. It has a similar appearance to Wooper, gaining a rounder body with arms, and a tail.\n |\n| Espeon\n | *Ēfi* (エーフィ)[32] | 0196 | Psychic\n | Eevee (#133) | End of evolution\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Skarmory\n | *Eāmudo* (エアームド)[10] | 0227 | Steel\n | Flying\n | No evolution\n | It is a Steel-type bird-esque Pokémon that is based on the Stymphalian Birds.

To make itself stronger, it will keep fighting foes, even if it loses. Even though it is tiny, it should not be ignored because it can slug any unwary target with no hesitation. It has a really strong and combative spirit. Tyrogue will get stressed if it does not train every day, so its trainer must set up various training methods on a schedule to train it. It is famous for fighting bigger foes and tending to its injuries. It evolves into Hitmonlee at high attack stats, Hitmonchan with high defence stats, and Hitmontop with equal attack and defence stats.\n |\n| Hitmontop\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | Onix (#095) | Mega Evolution | Under immense pressure underground, an Onix is said to have its rock-like body compressed into diamonds and evolve into Steelix. In a paper published by the University of Leicester, physicists calculated the plausibility of Onix evolving into Steelix through the stated lore. It would require pressures of 4.5–6 gigapascals at a temperature of 900 to 1,300 °C (1,650 to 2,370 °F) over a period of billions of years for this conversion to take place. Assuming these conditions, the resulting Steelix would be substantially smaller than given in the Pokédex entry and is considered implausible.[36] It lives even further down than Onix toward the earth's core. There are records of it reaching over 6/10 of a mile down underground. Steelix evolves after being traded while it holds a Metal Coat. In Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire it gained a Mega Evolution. Brock's Onix evolved into Steelix in the anime.\n |\n| Snubbull\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | Its curled hair is proof that it is a king. The longer the curl, the more respect it gains.

The concept of breeding was introduced in the second generation of *Pokémon* games as well, which allows players to manipulate the skills of their Pokémon to a greater degree.[1] Some of the new Pokémon introduced in *Gold* and *Silver* are pre-evolutions of other Pokémon, such as Pichu and Igglybuff.

However, Shudo intended Lugia as a creature that was simultaneously male and female. This dual nature was intended to embody one of the film's main messages, that people can be different and yet coexist without resorting to conflict.

Its pincers will crush anything it gets a hold of to bits. It does not use its wings to fly, but to regulate its body temperature so it does not start to melt in battle. It has a body of steel and is not fazed by regular attacks. It tends to beat its foes to scrap with its pincers which account for about a third of its body weight.

Apparently the fear gets absorbed by the Red orbs around its neck as food. It will get physical, yanking hair and biting people just to see their reaction. If you put your ear up to the Red orbs, you can hear shrieking. It does not get along with people who do not get frightened. It seems that Flutter mane is an ancient relative of it.\n |\n| Unown | *Unown* (アンノーン)[33] | 0201 | Psychic\n | No evolution\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | Farigiraf (#981) | It is a giraffe-esque Pokémon. Its rear end has an organ in its head acting as a small brain. It can smell and bite you so watch out. It does not need to sleep either so it can stay on guard all night. Girafarig uses its tail to emit psychic power to drive away enemies when it is in danger, and it can even fight while backwards. Its original design was more akin to a Pushmi-pullyu.\n |\n| Pineco\n | *Kunugidama* (クヌギダマ)[13] | 0204 | Bug\n | Beginning of evolution\n | Forretress (#205) | It attaches its head to the branch of a tree.

Donphan is capable lifting objects twice its own weight. It appears as a mix between an elephant and a tire. Ash once got a Phanpy that hatched out of an egg in the anime, which then evolved into a Donphan in Hoenn. It debuted in *Pokémon: The First Movie*.\n |\n| Porygon2\n | *Porygon 2* (ポリゴン2)[13] | 0233 | Normal\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | Furret are nimble, quick, and known for slipping through small spaces due to its small size and nimble feet.

Hoothoots have two legs but are almost always seen standing on one. They switch out which legs they stand on faster than the eye can process it. It debuted first in the *Pikachu's Rescue Adventure* short before the second movie.\n |\n| Noctowl\n | *Yorunozuku* (ヨルノズク)[13] | 0164 | Normal\n | Flying\n | Hoothoot (#163) | End of evolution\n | It will never fail to catch its prey at night due to its soft and quiet wings, and its impeccable night vision. Its English name is a portmanteau of \"nocturnal\" and \"owl\". Ash has a shiny Noctowl in the anime.\n |\n| Ledyba\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | Wobbuffet is a blue Pokémon resemblant of a punching bag. It lives in dark places to hide its black tail. Since it hates light and shock, it puffs up its body to repel it. It is never the first to attack. If its black tail is attacked though, it will viciously attack back or take its foe with them by using Destiny Bond. When two of them meet, they might try to see which one can go the longest without food. Trainers need to beware of this habit. It desperately tries to keep its tail hidden, it may have a secret. The most famous Wobbuffet is Jessie from Team Rocket's Wobbuffet in the anime, who serves as comic relief.\n |\n| Girafarig\n | *Kirinriki* (キリンリキ)[13] | 0203 | Normal\n | Psychic\n | Beginning of evolution\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | Clefairy (#035) | On nights that have many shooting stars, Cleffa can be found dancing through the night.

It gargles fresh water from streams to replenish them. Igglybuff's body is very bouncy, so if it bounces, there is no stopping it. In the English-dubbed anime, it was voiced by Rachael Lillis, who also voiced Jigglypuff and Wigglytuff.

It evolved due to a bizarre item. It was updated with the new ability to freely explore space, and even though it does not die in the vacuum of space, it cannot really move around well. Though it now exhibits new expressions and actions, it cannot only learn new things on its own, even things it should not learn, it also developed a language only understood by other Porygon2. It evolves by holding an Up-grade. It never made any appearances in the anime after the events of \"Denno Senshi Porygon\", with the exception of a very brief cameo in the intro scene of the fifteenth movie, *Kyurem vs. the Sword of Justice*. It is the only Pokémon with a number in its name and one of only two Pokémon (outside of Generation VIII) that never appeared in the anime, the other being its evolution, Porygon-Z.

Mareanie (introduced in *Sun & Moon*) loves to eat Corsola's coral branches as a snack and it actively chases them down just for their branches. Its Galarian form is a Ghost type. The Galarian form, being Ghost type with a white coloration, is speculated to be a reference to coral bleaching, which is an environmental issue that marks the death of corals which has been caused by global warming.

To hunt, it sits in the water waiting for food to just pass by. It does not move much so it does not get hungry as often. It has a similar appearance to Wooper, gaining a rounder body with arms, and a tail.\n |\n| Espeon\n | *Ēfi* (エーフィ)[32] | 0196 | Psychic\n | Eevee (#133) | End of evolution\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Skarmory\n | *Eāmudo* (エアームド)[10] | 0227 | Steel\n | Flying\n | No evolution\n | It is a Steel-type bird-esque Pokémon that is based on the Stymphalian Birds.

To make itself stronger, it will keep fighting foes, even if it loses. Even though it is tiny, it should not be ignored because it can slug any unwary target with no hesitation. It has a really strong and combative spirit. Tyrogue will get stressed if it does not train every day, so its trainer must set up various training methods on a schedule to train it. It is famous for fighting bigger foes and tending to its injuries. It evolves into Hitmonlee at high attack stats, Hitmonchan with high defence stats, and Hitmontop with equal attack and defence stats.\n |\n| Hitmontop\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | Onix (#095) | Mega Evolution | Under immense pressure underground, an Onix is said to have its rock-like body compressed into diamonds and evolve into Steelix. In a paper published by the University of Leicester, physicists calculated the plausibility of Onix evolving into Steelix through the stated lore. It would require pressures of 4.5–6 gigapascals at a temperature of 900 to 1,300 °C (1,650 to 2,370 °F) over a period of billions of years for this conversion to take place. Assuming these conditions, the resulting Steelix would be substantially smaller than given in the Pokédex entry and is considered implausible.[36] It lives even further down than Onix toward the earth's core. There are records of it reaching over 6/10 of a mile down underground. Steelix evolves after being traded while it holds a Metal Coat. In Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire it gained a Mega Evolution.

It finds swimming somewhat challenging. Fishermen say they try to catch it the moment after it fires its spikes and becomes defenseless. Qwilfish is based on Porcupine fish.[15] It gained a Hisuian Form, which trades its water type for the dark type.\n |\n| Scizor\n | *Hassamu* (ハッサム)[20] | 0212 | Bug\n | Steel\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| People | * Tsunekazu Ishihara\n* Sayuri Ichiishi\n* Junichi Masuda\n* Shigeki Morimoto\n* Atsuko Nishida\n* Shigeru Ohmori\n* Naoki Saito\n* Takeshi Shudo\n* Ken Sugimori\n* Satoshi Tajiri\n* Kunihiko Yuyama\n* Imakuni?\n |\n| Organizations | * Ambrella\n* Genius Sonority\n* ILCA\n* Wizards of the Coast\n |\n| Community | * MissJirachi\n* Pokémon Challenges\n |\n| Marketing | * Pokémon Center\n* Pokémon Jet\n* Burger King *Pokémon* container recall\n* Poképark\n* Pokéfuta\n* *Pokémon* 25th Anniversary\n* Pokémon Fossil Museum\n* *Project Voltage*\n |\n| Pop culture | * Pikachurin\n* Zbtb7\n* *Mazuca strigicincta*\n* *Binburrum articuno*\n* *Nocticola pheromosa*\n* *Aerodactylus*\n* *Bulbasaurus*\n* Pikachu virus\n* Tía Pikachu\n* *Pokémon* and pornography\n\t+ *doujinshi* incident\n* Fakemon\n |\n\n |\n\n |\n| * ![](image) Category\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | Espeon is the Psychic evolution of Eevee, evolving when its friendship is high enough during the daytime. It takes the form of a pink cat-like animal. Using its fur, it can sense movement in the air and predict weather accordingly. If its tail quivers, that means it is predicting its foes next move. Espeon is extremely loyal to those it deems worthy. It is said it developed Psychic powers to protect its trainer and friends. The orb on its head absorbs sunlight and glows when it is using psychic powers and grows dull when it is exhausted. It is not good at battling at night.\n |\n| Umbreon\n | *Blacky* (ブラッキー)[32] | 0197 | Dark | Eevee (#133) | End of evolution\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | When the sun shines brightly, Bellossom will open its bright-coloured petals to spin and dance. When the sun goes away, so does Bellossom. Bellossom evolves from Gloom using the Sun Stone. Like Hoothoot and Ledyba, it debuted first in the *Pikachu's Rescue Adventure* short before the second movie.\n |\n| Marill\n | *Marill* (マリル)[25] | 0183 | Water\n | Fairy[nb 3] | Azurill (#298) | Azumarill (#184) | *GameSpot*'s Frank Provo and *Kotaku*'s Patricia Hernandez have described Marill as \"cute\".[26][27] If you see a small, blue ball in the water, that is, in fact, Marill's oil-filled tail acting as a lifesaver so that it can catch and eat aquatic plants. Marill appears as a sea-blue round mouse with a zigzag like tail that ends in a blue orb. The blue orb at the end of its tail can light up. In the anime, Marill debuted in the Pikachu's Vacation short before the first movie and was sometimes called \"Pikablue\" and Tracey Sketchit also owns one.\n |\n| Azumarill\n | *Mariruri* (マリルリ)[14] | 0184 | Water\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"30c0b01c-85be-4a17-a5b5-e0c4be918ae9","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
