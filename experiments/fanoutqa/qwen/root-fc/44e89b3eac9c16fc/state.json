Dark and Steel types fare well against \"Psychic\" attacks, which was a dominant type in *Red* and *Blue*. The concept of breeding was introduced in the second generation of *Pok\u00e9mon* games as well, which allows players to manipulate the skills of their Pok\u00e9mon to a greater degree.[1] Some of the new Pok\u00e9mon introduced in *Gold* and *Silver* are pre-evolutions of other Pok\u00e9mon, such as Pichu and Igglybuff. These baby Pok\u00e9mon are only available by breeding their evolved forms.\n\n\n*Pok\u00e9mon Gold* and *Silver* were first revealed at Nintendo Space World in 1997. At this point, the game had a massively larger world map than the final game and this prototype featured around 40 Pok\u00e9mon designs that were removed and replaced when the games were released in 1999.[2]\n\n\n\n\n## List of Pok\u00e9mon[edit]\n\n\nPok\u00e9mon\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Details on Pok\u00e9mon names, National Pok\u00e9dex numbers, types and evolutions are obtained from The Pok\u00e9mon Company International's online Pok\u00e9dex.[3]\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** Prior to *X* and *Y*, Cleffa, Igglybuff, Togepi, Snubbull and Granbull were pure Normal types, while Togetic was Normal/Flying.\n3. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Starting in *X* and *Y*, Marill and Azumarill gained the Fairy type.\n4. **^** Paldean Wooper (introduced in *Pok\u00e9mon Scarlet* and *Violet*) are capable of evolving into Clodsire.\n5. **^** Only Galarian Corsola (introduced in *Pok\u00e9mon Sword* and *Shield*) are capable of evolving into Cursola.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nList of Pok\u00e9mon species introduced in Generation II (1999)[nb 1]\n| Name\n | National Pok\u00e9dexnumber\n | Type(s) | Evolves from\n | Evolves into\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| English\n | Japanese\n | Primary\n | Secondary\n |\n| Chikorita\n | *Chikorita* (\u30c1\u30b3\u30ea\u30fc\u30bf)[4] | 0152 | Grass\n | Beginning of evolution\n | Bayleef (#153) | A small quadrupedal green Pok\u00e9mon with a large lime green leaf on its head.

Some Pok\u00e9mon in this generation were introduced in animated adaptations of the franchise before *Gold* and *Silver*, such as Ho-Oh in the first episode of the *Pok\u00e9mon* anime series in 1998 and 1999, Togepi, which was a recurring character in the anime owned by Misty, Donphan in the Pok\u00e9mon first movie in 1998, Snubbull in the first Pikachu short movie in 1998, and Marill, which also debuted in that short film and was a recurring character in the anime owned by Tracey Sketchit in 1998 and 1999.

In the pack, The one with the most curved back horns is the leader and they choose it by fighting amongst each other. Long ago, people used to say that its eerie howls were calls of the Grim Reaper.

Its not fully capable of storing electricity yet. Despite its size, it can zap adult humans, but by doing so, even while playing with others, it will shock and startle itself and make itself cry. Pichu charges itself with electricity more easily on days with thunderclouds or when the air is very dry. You can hear the crackling of static electricity coming off it. It plays with others by touching tails and setting off sparks. This appears to be a test of courage. In the anime, a pair of Pichus are known as the Pichu Bros, and have appeared in their own shorts.\n |\n| Cleffa\n | *P\u012b* (\u30d4\u30a3)[14] | 0173 | Fairy[nb 2] | Beginning of evolution\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | Totodile (#158) | Feraligatr (#160) | If it bites something, it will not let go due to its teeth being similar to barbed backfish hooks, making them almost impossible to remove.\n |\n| Feraligatr\n | *\u014cdairu* (\u30aa\u30fc\u30c0\u30a4\u30eb)[7] | 0160 | Water\n | Croconaw (#159) | End of evolution\n | It intimidates its foes by opening its huge mouth.

If it launches kicks while spinning, it can essentially drill its way into the ground. It gets around faster while spinning rather than walking, which can be used both for offense and defense.

Like its counterparts, Hitmontop is based on a unique fighting style, capoeira.\n |\n| Smoochum\n | *Much\u016bru* (\u30e0\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb) | 0238 | Ice\n | Psychic\n | Beginning of evolution\n | Jynx (#124) | It likes to run, yet despite this, it often trips over itself.

It has the highest defense and special defense stat of any non legendary Pok\u00e9mon.\n |\n| Heracross\n | *Heracross* (\u30d8\u30e9\u30af\u30ed\u30b9)[9] | 0214 | Bug\n | Fighting | Beginning of evolution\n | Mega Evolution | When it needs to move anything in its way, it uses its large horn to launch the object through the air.

In Pok\u00e9mon Go, Heracross is found in parts of Florida, Central America and South America.\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | It lives in the deep sea, and the reason it does this is due to it causing storms by flapping its huge wings. It is the master of the Legendary Bird trio. It debuted in the second movie, where it spoke and was one of the heroes. Lugia was originally conceived by Takeshi Shudo, the head writer of the first *Pok\u00e9mon* anime. Lugia had been designed solely for *Pok\u00e9mon The Movie 2000*, and Shudo expressed surprise that the creature was later featured in the video games and TV show.[41] Lugia, who possessed a speaking role in the film, was given a masculine voice. However, Shudo intended Lugia as a creature that was simultaneously male and female. This dual nature was intended to embody one of the film's main messages, that people can be different and yet coexist without resorting to conflict. He showed \"overwhelming regret that he allowed Lugia to be voiced by a man\", considering Lugia, the \"creator of all life on Earth\", to be a \"maternal Pok\u00e9mon\". \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | Beginning of evolution\n | Wyrdeer (#899) | Its large antlers create a curved flow of space where reality is distorted. Those who stare at them will feel like they are gradually being unable to stand up. The round balls at the base of its antlers can be grounded up to aid in sleeping medicine. Its antlers were trading for high prices, and so it was hunted close to extinction. Some say that it was stronger in ancient times, where it lived in harsher climates and had lots of enemies and could evolve under own power. It also could wield psychic power a lot better than it does now too. Stantlers are based on various deer species, as well as the shishi-odoshi.

To eat its prey, the shell is opened, but it is so quick in doing this; the inside of its shell cannot be seen. It appears as a red creature inside a two part rock shell, with red cannon like protrusions. Brock has a Forretress in the anime.\n |\n| Dunsparce\n | *Nokotchi* (\u30ce\u30b3\u30c3\u30c1)[13] | 0206 | Normal\n | Beginning of evolution\n | Dudunsparce (#982) | Design inspired by the mythical Japanese creature Tsuchinoko[35] While it can fly a little using its tiny wings, it prefers to burrow backwards into the ground using its tail when it gets spotted.

Togepi energises off positive feelings like compassion and pleasure from people, and stores them in its hard shell, then it will release them to others that need it. It was one of the first Johto Pok\u00e9mon to appear, as an egg found by Ash and his friends. When it hatched, it bonded to Misty.

Donphan is capable lifting objects twice its own weight. It appears as a mix between an elephant and a tire. Ash once got a Phanpy that hatched out of an egg in the anime, which then evolved into a Donphan in Hoenn.

Since it hates light and shock, it puffs up its body to repel it. It is never the first to attack. If its black tail is attacked though, it will viciously attack back or take its foe with them by using Destiny Bond. When two of them meet, they might try to see which one can go the longest without food. Trainers need to beware of this habit. It desperately tries to keep its tail hidden, it may have a secret. The most famous Wobbuffet is Jessie from Team Rocket's Wobbuffet in the anime, who serves as comic relief.\n |\n| Girafarig\n | *Kirinriki* (\u30ad\u30ea\u30f3\u30ea\u30ad)[13] | 0203 | Normal\n | Psychic\n | Beginning of evolution\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | Clefairy (#035) | On nights that have many shooting stars, Cleffa can be found dancing through the night.

Though it now exhibits new expressions and actions, it cannot only learn new things on its own, even things it should not learn, it also developed a language only understood by other Porygon2. It evolves by holding an Up-grade. It never made any appearances in the anime after the events of \"Denno Senshi Porygon\", with the exception of a very brief cameo in the intro scene of the fifteenth movie, *Kyurem vs. the Sword of Justice*. It is the only Pok\u00e9mon with a number in its name and one of only two Pok\u00e9mon (outside of Generation VIII) that never appeared in the anime, the other being its evolution, Porygon-Z.

Mareanie (introduced in *Sun & Moon*) loves to eat Corsola's coral branches as a snack and it actively chases them down just for their branches. Its Galarian form is a Ghost type. The Galarian form, being Ghost type with a white coloration, is speculated to be a reference to coral bleaching, which is an environmental issue that marks the death of corals which has been caused by global warming.

To make itself stronger, it will keep fighting foes, even if it loses. Even though it is tiny, it should not be ignored because it can slug any unwary target with no hesitation. It has a really strong and combative spirit. Tyrogue will get stressed if it does not train every day, so its trainer must set up various training methods on a schedule to train it.

In a paper published by the University of Leicester, physicists calculated the plausibility of Onix evolving into Steelix through the stated lore. It would require pressures of 4.5\u20136 gigapascals at a temperature of 900 to 1,300\u00a0\u00b0C (1,650 to 2,370\u00a0\u00b0F) over a period of billions of years for this conversion to take place. Assuming these conditions, the resulting Steelix would be substantially smaller than given in the Pok\u00e9dex entry and is considered implausible.[36] It lives even further down than Onix toward the earth's core. There are records of it reaching over 6/10 of a mile down underground. Steelix evolves after being traded while it holds a Metal Coat. In Pok\u00e9mon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire it gained a Mega Evolution. Brock's Onix evolved into Steelix in the anime.\n |\n| Snubbull\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | Its curled hair is proof that it is a king. The longer the curl, the more respect it gains.
