A native of various open habitats in sub-Saharan Africa, males weigh about 6.0 tonnes (13,200 lb) on average.[9] The largest elephant ever recorded was shot in Angola in 1974. It was a male measuring 10.67 metres (35.0 ft) from trunk to tail and 4.17 metres (13.7 ft) lying on its side in a projected line from the highest point of the shoulder, to the base of the forefoot, indicating a standing shoulder height of 3.96 metres (13.0 ft). This male had a computed weight of 10.4 tonnes.[1]\n\n\n\n\n## Heaviest living animals[edit]\n\n\nThe heaviest living animals are all whales.

ARKive (6 August 2004)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe **largest animal** currently alive is the blue whale. The maximum recorded weight was 190 tonnes for a specimen measuring 27.6 metres (91 ft), whereas longer ones, up to 33.6 metres (110 ft), have been recorded but not weighed.[1][2][3] It is estimated, this individual could have a mass of 250 tonnes.[4][5] The longest non-colonial animal is the lion's mane jellyfish (36.6m / 120 ft).[6]\n\n\nIn 2023, paleontologists estimated that the extinct whale *Perucetus*, discovered in Peru, may have outweighed the blue whale, with a mass of 85-340 t (84-335 long tons; 94-375 short tonnes.)[7] While controversial, estimates for the weight of the sauropod *Bruhathkayosaurus* suggest it was around 110-170 tons, with the highest estimate being 240 tons, if scaled with *Patagotitan*, although actual fossil remains no longer exist, and that estimation is based on described dimensions in 1987.[8] The upper estimates of weight for these two prehistoric animals would have easily rivaled or exceeded the blue whale. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe largest land mammal extant today is the African bush elephant. The largest extinct land mammal known was long considered to be *Paraceratherium orgosensis*, a rhinoceros relative thought to have stood up to 4.8 m (15.7 ft) tall, measured over 7.4 m (24.3 ft) long and may have weighed about 17 tonnes.[55][56] In 2015, a study suggested that one example of the proboscidean *Palaeoloxodon namadicus* may have been the largest land mammal ever, based on extensive research of fragmentary leg bone fossils from one individual, with a maximum estimated size of 22 tonnes.[57][55]\n\n\n\n### Stem-mammals (Synapsida)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Rank\n | Animal\n | Average mass[kg (lb)]\n | Maximum mass[kg (lb)]\n | Average total length[m (ft)]\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Saltwater crocodile | 450 (1,000)[77][78] | 2,000 (4,400)[79][80] | 4.5 (14.8)[77][81] |\n| 2 | Nile crocodile | 410 (900)[82] | 1,090 (2,400)[1] | 4.2 (13.8)[82] |\n| 3 | Orinoco crocodile | 380 (840)[*citation needed*] | 1,100 (2,400)[*citation needed*] | 4.1 (13.5)[83][84] |\n| 4 | Leatherback sea turtle | 364 (800)[85][86] | 932 (2,050)[1] | 2.0 (6.6)[1] |\n| 5 | American crocodile | 336 (740)[87] | 1,000 (2,200)[88] | 4.0 (13.1)[89][90] |\n| 6 | Black caiman | 300 (661)[*citation needed*] | 1,000 (2,200)[*citation needed*] | 3.9 (12.8)[91][92][93][94] |\n| 7 | Gharial | 250 (550)[95] | 1,000 (2,200)[96] | 4.5 (14.8)[95] |\n| 8 | American alligator | 240 (530)[97][98] | 1,000 (2,200)[1] | 3.4 (11.2)[98] |\n| 9 | Mugger crocodile | 225 (495)[97] | 700 (1,500)[99] | 3.3 (10.8)[98] |\n| 10 | False gharial | 210 (460)[100] | 590 (1,300)[101] | 4.0 (13.1)[102] |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n16. ^ ***a*** ***b*** North Atlantic Right Whale.

At the highest estimates, this would make *Perucetus* the heaviest known animal in history.[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nInsects, a class of Arthropoda, are easily the most numerous class of organisms, with over one million identified species, and probably many undescribed species. The heaviest insect is almost certainly a species of beetle, which incidentally is the most species-rich order of organisms. Although heavyweight giant wetas (*Deinacrida heteracantha*) are known, the elephant beetles of Central and South America, (*Megasoma elephas*) and (*M. actaeon*), the Titan beetle (*Titanus giganteus*) of the neotropical rainforest or the Goliath beetles, (*Goliathus goliatus*) and (*G. regius*), of Africa's rainforest are thought to reach a higher weight.[245] The most frequently crowned are the Goliath beetles, the top known size of which is at least 100 g (3.5 oz) and 11.5 cm (4.5 in).[1] The elephant beetles and titan beetle can reach greater lengths than the Goliath, at up to 13.1 and 15.2 cm (5.2 and 6.0 in), respectively, but this is in part thanks to their rather large horns. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 11 | Aldabra giant tortoise | 205 (450)[103] | 360 (790)[1] | 1.4 (4.6)[104] |\n| 12 | Loggerhead sea turtle | 200 (441)[*citation needed*] | 545 (1,202)[*citation needed*] | 0.95 (3.2)[104] |\n| 13 | Green sea turtle | 190 (418.9)[105] | 395 (870.8)[82] | 1.12 (3.67)[82] |\n| 14 | Slender-snouted crocodile | 180 (400)[106] | 325 (720)[106] | 3.3 (10.8)[106] |\n| 15 | Galapagos tortoise | 175 (390)[107] | 417 (919)[108] | 1.5 (4.9)[109] |\n\n\n### Dinosaurs (Dinosauria)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Dinosaur size\n\nSee also: Largest prehistoric animals\n\n![](image)*Bruhathkayosaurus matleyi*, potentially the largest animal to have walked the earth.\n![](image)A human and the longest known dinosaurs of the five major clades.

These species are almost all flightless, which allows for these particular birds to have denser bones and heavier bodies. Flightless birds comprise less than 2% of all living bird species.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThis particular species of moa stood up to 3.7 m (12 ft) tall,[157] but weighed about half as much as a large elephant bird or mihirung due to its comparatively slender frame.[1]\n\n\nThe heaviest bird ever capable of flight was *Argentavis magnificens*, the largest member of the now extinct family Teratornithidae, found in Miocene-aged fossil beds of Argentina, with a wingspan up to 5.5 m (18 ft), a length of up to 1.25 m (4.1 ft), a height on the ground of up to 1.75 m (5.7 ft) and a body weight of at least 71 kg (157 lb).[1][162][163] *Pelagornis sandersi* is thought to have had an even larger wingspan of about 6.1–7.4 m (20–24 ft), but is only about 22–40 kg (49–88 lb), half the mass of the former.[164][163]\n\n\n\n##### Heaviest living bird species[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe largest ceratopsians were *Triceratops* and its ancestor *Eotriceratops* from the late Cretaceous of North America.

A large male ostrich can reach a height of 2.8 m (9.2 ft) and weigh over 156 kg (344 lb).[157] A mass of 200 kg (440 lb) has been cited for the common ostrich but no wild ostriches of this weight have been verified.[158] Eggs laid by the ostrich can weigh 1.4 kg (3.1 lb) and are the largest eggs in the world today.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe plant-eating dicynodont *Lisowicia bojani* is the largest-known of all non-mammalian synapsids, at 4.5 m (15 ft) and 9,000 kg (20,000 lb).[58][67][68] The largest carnivorous therapsid was the aforementioned *Anteosaurus* from what is now South Africa during Middle Permian epoch. It reached 5–6 m (16–20 ft) long, and about 500–600 kg (1,100–1,300 lb) in weight.[60]\n### Reptiles (Reptilia)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of largest reptiles\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n7. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Bianucci, Giovanni; Lambert, Olivier; Urbina, Mario; Merella, Marco; Collareta, Alberto; Bennion, Rebecca; Salas-Gismondi, Roberto; Benites-Palomino, Aldo; Post, Klaas; de Muizon, Christian; Bosio, Giulia; Di Celma, Claudio; Malinverno, Elisa; Paolo Pierantoni, Pietro; Maria Villa, Igor; Amson, Eli (2 August 2023). \"A heavyweight early whale pushes the boundaries of vertebrate morphology\". *Nature*. **620** (7975): 824–829.

A member of the monitor lizard family (Varanidae), it is the largest living species of lizard, growing to a maximum length of more than 3 metres (9.8 feet) in rare cases and weighing up to approximately 166 kilograms (366 pounds).[76]\n\n\n\n#### Largest living reptiles[edit]\n\n\nThe following is a list of the largest living reptile species ranked by average weight, which is dominated by the crocodilians. Unlike mammals, birds, or fish, the mass of large reptiles is frequently poorly documented and many are subject to conjecture and estimation.[1]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The saltwater crocodile is the largest living reptile.\nThe largest living reptile, a representative of the order Crocodilia, is the saltwater crocodile (*Crocodylus porosus*) of Southern Asia and Australia, with adult males being typically 3.9–5.5 m (13–18 ft) long. The largest confirmed saltwater crocodile on record was 6.32 m (20.7 ft) long, and weighed about 1,360 kg (3,000 lb).[1] Unconfirmed reports of much larger crocodiles exist, but examinations of incomplete remains have never suggested a length greater than 7 m (23 ft).[69] Also, a living specimen estimated at 7 m (23 ft) and 2,000 kg (4,400 lb) has been accepted by the Guinness Book of World Records.[70] However, due to the difficulty of trapping and measuring a very large living crocodile, the accuracy of these dimensions has yet to be verified. A specimen named Lolong caught alive in the Philippines in 2011 (died February 2013) was found to have measured 6.17 m (20.2 ft) in length.[71][72][73][74][75]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n65. **^** Brink, Kirstin S.; Reisz, Robert R.

Of almost exactly the same upper proportions as the largest elephant birds was *Dromornis stirtoni* of Australia, part of a 26,000-year-old group called mihirungs of the family Dromornithidae.[160] The largest carnivorous bird was *Brontornis*, an extinct flightless bird from South America which reached a weight of 350 to 400 kg (770 to 880 lb) and a height of about 2.8 m (9 ft 2 in).[161] The tallest carnivorous bird was *Kelenken*, which could reach 3 to 3.2 meters in height and 220 to 250 kilograms. The tallest bird ever was the giant moa (*Dinornis maximus*), part of the moa family of New Zealand that went extinct around 1500 AD. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe largest of the ants, and the heaviest species of the order, are the females of the African *Dorylus helvolus*, reaching a length of 5.1 cm (2.0 in) and a weight of 8.5 g (0.30 oz).[1] The ant that averages the largest for the mean size within the whole colony is a ponerine ant, *Dinoponera gigantea*, from South America, averaging up to 3.3 cm (1.3 in) from the mandibles to the end of abdomen.[1] Workers of the bulldog ant (*Myrmecia brevinoda*) of Australia are up to 3.7 cm (1.5 in) in total length, although much of this is from their extremely large mandibles.[1] The largest of the bee species, also in the order Hymenoptera, is *Megachile pluto* of Indonesia, the females of which can be 3.8 cm (1.5 in) long, with a 6.3 cm (2.5 in) wingspan. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTheropods (Theropoda)\nThe largest theropod known from a nearly complete skeleton is the most complete *Tyrannosaurus* *rex* specimen, nicknamed \"Sue\", which was discovered in South Dakota in 1990 and now mounted in the Field Museum of Chicago at a total length of 12.3 m (40 ft). Body mass estimates have reached over 9,500 kg,[140] though other figures, such as Hartman's 2013 estimate of 8,400 kg,[141] have been lower.\nAnother giant theropod is *Spinosaurus aegyptiacus* from the mid-Cretaceous of North Africa. Size estimates have been fluctuating far more over the years, with length estimates ranging from 12.6 to 18 m and mass estimates from 7 to 20.9 t.[142][143] Recent findings favor a length exceeding 15 m [144] and a body mass of 7.5 tons.[145]\nOther contenders known from partial skeletons include *Giganotosaurus carolinii* (est. 12.2–13.2 m and 6-13.8 tonnes) and *Carcharodontosaurus saharicus* (est. 12-13.3 m and 6.2-15.1 tonnes).[143][146][147][148][149][118]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe largest extant theropod is the common ostrich (see birds, below).\nArmored dinosaurs (Thyreophora)\nThe largest thyreophorans were *Ankylosaurus* and *Stegosaurus*, from the Late Cretaceous and Late Jurassic periods (respectively) of what is now North America, both measuring up to 9 m (30 ft) in length and estimated to weigh up to 6 tonnes.[150][151]\nOrnithopods (Ornithopoda)\nThe largest ornithopods were the hadrosaurids *Shantungosaurus*, a late Cretaceous dinosaur found in the Shandong Peninsula of China, and *Magnapaulia* from the late Cretaceous of North America. Both species are known from fragmentary remains but are estimated to have reached over 15 m (49 ft) in length[152][153] and were likely the heaviest non-sauropod dinosaurs, estimated at over 23 tonnes.[153]\nCeratopsians (Ceratopsia)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n107. **^** ADW: Geochelone nigra: Information.

Most calcareous sponges do not exceed 10 cm (3.9 in) tall.[*citation needed*]\nHexactinellid sponges (Hexactinellida)\nA relatively common species, *Rhabdocalyptus dawsoni*, can reach a height of 1 m (3.3 ft) once they are of a very old age.[295] This is the maximum size recorded for a hexactinellid sponge.[*citation needed*]\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Largest prehistoric animals\n* Megafauna\n* Largest organisms\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe beetles are the largest order of organisms on earth, with about 400,000 species so far identified. The most massive species are the *Goliathus*, *Megasoma* and *Titanus* beetles already mentioned. Another fairly large species is the Hercules beetle (*Dynastes hercules*) of the neotropic rainforest with a maximum overall length of at least 19 cm (7.5 in) including the extremely long pronotal horn. The weight in this species does not exceed 16.5 g (0.58 oz).[1] The longest overall beetle is a species of longhorn beetle, *Batocera wallacei*, from New Guinea, which can attain a length of 26.6 cm (10.5 in), about 19 cm (7.5 in) of which is comprised by the long antennae.[1]\nEarwigs (Dermaptera)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHowever, the toad *Beelzebufo ampinga*, found in fossil from the Cretaceous era in what is now Madagascar, was estimated to grow to 41 cm (16 in) long and weigh up to 4.5 kg (9.9 lb), making it the largest frog ever known.[177] But in more recent studies, animals of this species have been estimated to have grown to at least 23.2 cm (9.1 in) (snout-vent length), which is around the size a modern African bullfrog can reach.[178] The largest tree frog is the Australasian white-lipped tree frog (*Litoria infrafrenata*), the females of which can reach a length of 14 cm (5.5 in) from snout to vent and can weigh up to 115 g (4.1 oz).[179] The family Leptodactylidae, one of the most diverse anuran families, also has some very large members. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe largest of this widespread, varied complex of insects are the giant wetas of New Zealand, which is now split among 12 species. The largest of these is the Little Barrier Island giant weta (*Deinacrida heteracantha*), the largest specimen was weighed at 71.3 g (2.52 oz), one of the largest insects weights ever known. These heavyweight insects can be over 9 cm (3.5 in) long.[1] The largest grasshopper species is often considered to be the Australian giant grasshopper (*Valanga irregularis*), which ranges up to 9 cm (3.5 in) in length.[268] The American eastern lubber grasshopper (*Romalea guttata*) can allegedly range up to 10 cm (3.9 in) in length.[269] However, the greatest grasshopper sizes known, to 12 cm (4.7 in), have been cited in the South American giant grasshopper (*Tropidacris violaceus*). \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n101. **^** Ahmad, A.

The largest extinct land mammal known was long considered to be *Paraceratherium orgosensis*, a rhinoceros relative thought to have stood up to 4.8 m (15.7 ft) tall, measured over 7.4 m (24.3 ft) long and may have weighed about 17 tonnes.[55][56] In 2015, a study suggested that one example of the proboscidean *Palaeoloxodon namadicus* may have been the largest land mammal ever, based on extensive research of fragmentary leg bone fossils from one individual, with a maximum estimated size of 22 tonnes.[57][55]\n\n\n\n### Stem-mammals (Synapsida)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Rank\n | Animal\n | Average mass[kg (lb)]\n | Maximum mass[kg (lb)]\n | Average total length[m (ft)]\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Saltwater crocodile | 450 (1,000)[77][78] | 2,000 (4,400)[79][80] | 4.5 (14.8)[77][81] |\n| 2 | Nile crocodile | 410 (900)[82] | 1,090 (2,400)[1] | 4.2 (13.8)[82] |\n| 3 | Orinoco crocodile | 380 (840)[*citation needed*] | 1,100 (2,400)[*citation needed*] | 4.1 (13.5)[83][84] |\n| 4 | Leatherback sea turtle | 364 (800)[85][86] | 932 (2,050)[1] | 2.0 (6.6)[1] |\n| 5 | American crocodile | 336 (740)[87] | 1,000 (2,200)[88] | 4.0 (13.1)[89][90] |\n| 6 | Black caiman | 300 (661)[*citation needed*] | 1,000 (2,200)[*citation needed*] | 3.9 (12.8)[91][92][93][94] |\n| 7 | Gharial | 250 (550)[95] | 1,000 (2,200)[96] | 4.5 (14.8)[95] |\n| 8 | American alligator | 240 (530)[97][98] | 1,000 (2,200)[1] | 3.4 (11.2)[98] |\n| 9 | Mugger crocodile | 225 (495)[97] | 700 (1,500)[99] | 3.3 (10.8)[98] |\n| 10 | False gharial | 210 (460)[100] | 590 (1,300)[101] | 4.0 (13.1)[102] |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n16. ^ ***a*** ***b*** North Atlantic Right Whale.

At the highest estimates, this would make *Perucetus* the heaviest known animal in history.[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nInsects, a class of Arthropoda, are easily the most numerous class of organisms, with over one million identified species, and probably many undescribed species. The heaviest insect is almost certainly a species of beetle, which incidentally is the most species-rich order of organisms. Although heavyweight giant wetas (*Deinacrida heteracantha*) are known, the elephant beetles of Central and South America, (*Megasoma elephas*) and (*M. actaeon*), the Titan beetle (*Titanus giganteus*) of the neotropical rainforest or the Goliath beetles, (*Goliathus goliatus*) and (*G. regius*), of Africa's rainforest are thought to reach a higher weight.[245] The most frequently crowned are the Goliath beetles, the top known size of which is at least 100 g (3.5 oz) and 11.5 cm (4.5 in).[1] The elephant beetles and titan beetle can reach greater lengths than the Goliath, at up to 13.1 and 15.2 cm (5.2 and 6.0 in), respectively, but this is in part thanks to their rather large horns. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 11 | Aldabra giant tortoise | 205 (450)[103] | 360 (790)[1] | 1.4 (4.6)[104] |\n| 12 | Loggerhead sea turtle | 200 (441)[*citation needed*] | 545 (1,202)[*citation needed*] | 0.95 (3.2)[104] |\n| 13 | Green sea turtle | 190 (418.9)[105] | 395 (870.8)[82] | 1.12 (3.67)[82] |\n| 14 | Slender-snouted crocodile | 180 (400)[106] | 325 (720)[106] | 3.3 (10.8)[106] |\n| 15 | Galapagos tortoise | 175 (390)[107] | 417 (919)[108] | 1.5 (4.9)[109] |\n\n\n### Dinosaurs (Dinosauria)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Dinosaur size\n\nSee also: Largest prehistoric animals\n\n![](image)*Bruhathkayosaurus matleyi*, potentially the largest animal to have walked the earth.\n![](image)A human and the longest known dinosaurs of the five major clades.

The largest confirmed saltwater crocodile on record was 6.32 m (20.7 ft) long, and weighed about 1,360 kg (3,000 lb).[1] Unconfirmed reports of much larger crocodiles exist, but examinations of incomplete remains have never suggested a length greater than 7 m (23 ft).[69] Also, a living specimen estimated at 7 m (23 ft) and 2,000 kg (4,400 lb) has been accepted by the Guinness Book of World Records.[70] However, due to the difficulty of trapping and measuring a very large living crocodile, the accuracy of these dimensions has yet to be verified. A specimen named Lolong caught alive in the Philippines in 2011 (died February 2013) was found to have measured 6.17 m (20.2 ft) in length.[71][72][73][74][75]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n65. **^** Brink, Kirstin S.; Reisz, Robert R.

Of almost exactly the same upper proportions as the largest elephant birds was *Dromornis stirtoni* of Australia, part of a 26,000-year-old group called mihirungs of the family Dromornithidae.[160] The largest carnivorous bird was *Brontornis*, an extinct flightless bird from South America which reached a weight of 350 to 400 kg (770 to 880 lb) and a height of about 2.8 m (9 ft 2 in).[161] The tallest carnivorous bird was *Kelenken*, which could reach 3 to 3.2 meters in height and 220 to 250 kilograms. The tallest bird ever was the giant moa (*Dinornis maximus*), part of the moa family of New Zealand that went extinct around 1500 AD. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe largest of the ants, and the heaviest species of the order, are the females of the African *Dorylus helvolus*, reaching a length of 5.1 cm (2.0 in) and a weight of 8.5 g (0.30 oz).[1] The ant that averages the largest for the mean size within the whole colony is a ponerine ant, *Dinoponera gigantea*, from South America, averaging up to 3.3 cm (1.3 in) from the mandibles to the end of abdomen.[1] Workers of the bulldog ant (*Myrmecia brevinoda*) of Australia are up to 3.7 cm (1.5 in) in total length, although much of this is from their extremely large mandibles.[1] The largest of the bee species, also in the order Hymenoptera, is *Megachile pluto* of Indonesia, the females of which can be 3.8 cm (1.5 in) long, with a 6.3 cm (2.5 in) wingspan. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTheropods (Theropoda)\nThe largest theropod known from a nearly complete skeleton is the most complete *Tyrannosaurus* *rex* specimen, nicknamed \"Sue\", which was discovered in South Dakota in 1990 and now mounted in the Field Museum of Chicago at a total length of 12.3 m (40 ft). Body mass estimates have reached over 9,500 kg,[140] though other figures, such as Hartman's 2013 estimate of 8,400 kg,[141] have been lower.\nAnother giant theropod is *Spinosaurus aegyptiacus* from the mid-Cretaceous of North Africa. Size estimates have been fluctuating far more over the years, with length estimates ranging from 12.6 to 18 m and mass estimates from 7 to 20.9 t.[142][143] Recent findings favor a length exceeding 15 m [144] and a body mass of 7.5 tons.[145]\nOther contenders known from partial skeletons include *Giganotosaurus carolinii* (est. 12.2–13.2 m and 6-13.8 tonnes) and *Carcharodontosaurus saharicus* (est. 12-13.3 m and 6.2-15.1 tonnes).[143][146][147][148][149][118]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe largest extant theropod is the common ostrich (see birds, below).\nArmored dinosaurs (Thyreophora)\nThe largest thyreophorans were *Ankylosaurus* and *Stegosaurus*, from the Late Cretaceous and Late Jurassic periods (respectively) of what is now North America, both measuring up to 9 m (30 ft) in length and estimated to weigh up to 6 tonnes.[150][151]\nOrnithopods (Ornithopoda)\nThe largest ornithopods were the hadrosaurids *Shantungosaurus*, a late Cretaceous dinosaur found in the Shandong Peninsula of China, and *Magnapaulia* from the late Cretaceous of North America. Both species are known from fragmentary remains but are estimated to have reached over 15 m (49 ft) in length[152][153] and were likely the heaviest non-sauropod dinosaurs, estimated at over 23 tonnes.[153]\nCeratopsians (Ceratopsia)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n107. **^** ADW: Geochelone nigra: Information.

The tallest and heaviest sauropod known from a complete skeleton is a specimen of an immature *Giraffatitan* discovered in Tanzania between 1907 and 1912, now mounted in the Museum für Naturkunde of Berlin. It is 12–13.27 m (39.4–43.5 ft) tall and weighed 23.3–39.5 tonnes.[110][111][112][113][114][115] The longest is a 25 m (82 ft) long specimen of *Diplodocus* discovered in Wyoming, and mounted in Pittsburgh's Carnegie Natural History Museum in 1907. A *Patagotitan* specimen found in Argentina in 2014 is estimated to have been 37–40 m (121–131 ft) long and 20 m (66 ft) tall, with a weight of 69–77 tonnes.[116][117]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n130. **^** Paul, G.S.

Formerly considered conspecific with the Chinese giant salamander (*A. davidianus*), the maximum size of this nearly human-sized river-dweller is 64 kg (141 lb) and almost 1.83 m (6.0 ft).[1] Before amniotes became the dominant tetrapods, several giant amphibian proto-tetrapods existed and were certainly the dominant animals in their ecosystems. The largest known was the crocodile-like *Prionosuchus*, which reached a length of 9 m (30 ft).[175]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Despite its inert appearance, the heavyweight *Xestospongia muta* is indeed an animal\nThe largest known species of sea sponge is the giant barrel sponge, *Xestospongia muta*. These massively built sponges can reach 2.4 m (8 ft) in height and can be about the same thickness at the thickest part of the \"body\".[293] Some of these creatures have been estimated to be over 2,400 years of age.[294]\n\n\n\nCalcareous sponges (Calcarea)\nThe largest known of these small, inconspicuous sponges is probably the species *Pericharax heteroraphis*, attaining a height of 30 cm (0.98 ft). Most calcareous sponges do not exceed 10 cm (3.9 in) tall.[*citation needed*]\nHexactinellid sponges (Hexactinellida)\nA relatively common species, *Rhabdocalyptus dawsoni*, can reach a height of 1 m (3.3 ft) once they are of a very old age.[295] This is the maximum size recorded for a hexactinellid sponge.[*citation needed*]\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Largest prehistoric animals\n* Megafauna\n* Largest organisms\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe beetles are the largest order of organisms on earth, with about 400,000 species so far identified. The most massive species are the *Goliathus*, *Megasoma* and *Titanus* beetles already mentioned. Another fairly large species is the Hercules beetle (*Dynastes hercules*) of the neotropic rainforest with a maximum overall length of at least 19 cm (7.5 in) including the extremely long pronotal horn. The weight in this species does not exceed 16.5 g (0.58 oz).[1] The longest overall beetle is a species of longhorn beetle, *Batocera wallacei*, from New Guinea, which can attain a length of 26.6 cm (10.5 in), about 19 cm (7.5 in) of which is comprised by the long antennae.[1]\nEarwigs (Dermaptera)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHowever, the toad *Beelzebufo ampinga*, found in fossil from the Cretaceous era in what is now Madagascar, was estimated to grow to 41 cm (16 in) long and weigh up to 4.5 kg (9.9 lb), making it the largest frog ever known.[177] But in more recent studies, animals of this species have been estimated to have grown to at least 23.2 cm (9.1 in) (snout-vent length), which is around the size a modern African bullfrog can reach.[178] The largest tree frog is the Australasian white-lipped tree frog (*Litoria infrafrenata*), the females of which can reach a length of 14 cm (5.5 in) from snout to vent and can weigh up to 115 g (4.1 oz).[179] The family Leptodactylidae, one of the most diverse anuran families, also has some very large members. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe largest of this widespread, varied complex of insects are the giant wetas of New Zealand, which is now split among 12 species. The largest of these is the Little Barrier Island giant weta (*Deinacrida heteracantha*), the largest specimen was weighed at 71.3 g (2.52 oz), one of the largest insects weights ever known. These heavyweight insects can be over 9 cm (3.5 in) long.[1] The largest grasshopper species is often considered to be the Australian giant grasshopper (*Valanga irregularis*), which ranges up to 9 cm (3.5 in) in length.[268] The American eastern lubber grasshopper (*Romalea guttata*) can allegedly range up to 10 cm (3.9 in) in length.[269] However, the greatest grasshopper sizes known, to 12 cm (4.7 in), have been cited in the South American giant grasshopper (*Tropidacris violaceus*). \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n101. **^** Ahmad, A.
