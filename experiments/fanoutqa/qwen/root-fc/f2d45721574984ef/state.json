The maximum recorded weight was 190 tonnes for a specimen measuring 27.6 metres (91\u00a0ft), whereas longer ones, up to 33.6 metres (110\u00a0ft), have been recorded but not weighed.[1][2][3] It is estimated, this individual could have a mass of 250 tonnes.[4][5] The longest non-colonial animal is the lion's mane jellyfish (36.6m / 120\u00a0ft).[6]\n\n\nIn 2023, paleontologists estimated that the extinct whale *Perucetus*, discovered in Peru, may have outweighed the blue whale, with a mass of 85-340 t (84-335 long tons; 94-375 short tonnes.)[7] While controversial, estimates for the weight of the sauropod *Bruhathkayosaurus* suggest it was around 110-170 tons, with the highest estimate being 240 tons, if scaled with *Patagotitan*, although actual fossil remains no longer exist, and that estimation is based on described dimensions in 1987.[8] The upper estimates of weight for these two prehistoric animals would have easily rivaled or exceeded the blue whale. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe largest land mammal extant today is the African bush elephant. The largest extinct land mammal known was long considered to be *Paraceratherium orgosensis*, a rhinoceros relative thought to have stood up to 4.8\u00a0m (15.7\u00a0ft) tall, measured over 7.4\u00a0m (24.3\u00a0ft) long and may have weighed about 17 tonnes.[55][56] In 2015, a study suggested that one example of the proboscidean *Palaeoloxodon namadicus* may have been the largest land mammal ever, based on extensive research of fragmentary leg bone fossils from one individual, with a maximum estimated size of 22 tonnes.[57][55]\n\n\n\n### Stem-mammals (Synapsida)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Rank\n | Animal\n | Average mass[kg (lb)]\n | Maximum mass[kg (lb)]\n | Average total length[m (ft)]\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Saltwater crocodile | 450 (1,000)[77][78] | 2,000 (4,400)[79][80] | 4.5 (14.8)[77][81] |\n| 2 | Nile crocodile | 410 (900)[82] | 1,090 (2,400)[1] | 4.2 (13.8)[82] |\n| 3 | Orinoco crocodile | 380 (840)[*citation needed*] | 1,100 (2,400)[*citation needed*] | 4.1 (13.5)[83][84] |\n| 4 | Leatherback sea turtle | 364 (800)[85][86] | 932 (2,050)[1] | 2.0 (6.6)[1] |\n| 5 | American crocodile | 336 (740)[87] | 1,000 (2,200)[88] | 4.0 (13.1)[89][90] |\n| 6 | Black caiman | 300 (661)[*citation needed*] | 1,000 (2,200)[*citation needed*] | 3.9 (12.8)[91][92][93][94] |\n| 7 | Gharial | 250 (550)[95] | 1,000 (2,200)[96] | 4.5 (14.8)[95] |\n| 8 | American alligator | 240 (530)[97][98] | 1,000 (2,200)[1] | 3.4 (11.2)[98] |\n| 9 | Mugger crocodile | 225 (495)[97] | 700 (1,500)[99] | 3.3 (10.8)[98] |\n| 10 | False gharial | 210 (460)[100] | 590 (1,300)[101] | 4.0 (13.1)[102] |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n16. ^ ***a*** ***b*** North Atlantic Right Whale.

At the highest estimates, this would make *Perucetus* the heaviest known animal in history.[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nInsects, a class of Arthropoda, are easily the most numerous class of organisms, with over one million identified species, and probably many undescribed species. The heaviest insect is almost certainly a species of beetle, which incidentally is the most species-rich order of organisms. Although heavyweight giant wetas (*Deinacrida heteracantha*) are known, the elephant beetles of Central and South America, (*Megasoma elephas*) and (*M. actaeon*), the Titan beetle (*Titanus giganteus*) of the neotropical rainforest or the Goliath beetles, (*Goliathus goliatus*) and (*G. regius*), of Africa's rainforest are thought to reach a higher weight.[245] The most frequently crowned are the Goliath beetles, the top known size of which is at least 100\u00a0g (3.5\u00a0oz) and 11.5\u00a0cm (4.5\u00a0in).[1] The elephant beetles and titan beetle can reach greater lengths than the Goliath, at up to 13.1 and 15.2\u00a0cm (5.2 and 6.0\u00a0in), respectively, but this is in part thanks to their rather large horns. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 11 | Aldabra giant tortoise | 205 (450)[103] | 360 (790)[1] | 1.4 (4.6)[104] |\n| 12 | Loggerhead sea turtle | 200 (441)[*citation needed*] | 545 (1,202)[*citation needed*] | 0.95 (3.2)[104] |\n| 13 | Green sea turtle | 190 (418.9)[105] | 395 (870.8)[82] | 1.12 (3.67)[82] |\n| 14 | Slender-snouted crocodile | 180 (400)[106] | 325 (720)[106] | 3.3 (10.8)[106] |\n| 15 | Galapagos tortoise | 175 (390)[107] | 417 (919)[108] | 1.5 (4.9)[109] |\n\n\n### Dinosaurs (Dinosauria)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Dinosaur size\n\nSee also: Largest prehistoric animals\n\n![](image)*Bruhathkayosaurus matleyi*, potentially the largest animal to have walked the earth.\n![](image)A human and the longest known dinosaurs of the five major clades.

The largest confirmed saltwater crocodile on record was 6.32\u00a0m (20.7\u00a0ft) long, and weighed about 1,360\u00a0kg (3,000\u00a0lb).[1] Unconfirmed reports of much larger crocodiles exist, but examinations of incomplete remains have never suggested a length greater than 7\u00a0m (23\u00a0ft).[69] Also, a living specimen estimated at 7\u00a0m (23\u00a0ft) and 2,000\u00a0kg (4,400\u00a0lb) has been accepted by the Guinness Book of World Records.[70] However, due to the difficulty of trapping and measuring a very large living crocodile, the accuracy of these dimensions has yet to be verified. A specimen named Lolong caught alive in the Philippines in 2011 (died February 2013) was found to have measured 6.17\u00a0m (20.2\u00a0ft) in length.[71][72][73][74][75]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n65. **^** Brink, Kirstin S.; Reisz, Robert R.

Both species are known from fragmentary remains but are estimated to have reached over 15\u00a0m (49\u00a0ft) in length[152][153] and were likely the heaviest non-sauropod dinosaurs, estimated at over 23\u00a0tonnes.[153]\nCeratopsians (Ceratopsia)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n107. **^** ADW: Geochelone nigra: Information.

The largest known was the crocodile-like *Prionosuchus*, which reached a length of 9\u00a0m (30\u00a0ft).[175]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Despite its inert appearance, the heavyweight *Xestospongia muta* is indeed an animal\nThe largest known species of sea sponge is the giant barrel sponge, *Xestospongia muta*. These massively built sponges can reach 2.4\u00a0m (8\u00a0ft) in height and can be about the same thickness at the thickest part of the \"body\".[293] Some of these creatures have been estimated to be over 2,400 years of age.[294]\n\n\n\nCalcareous sponges (Calcarea)\nThe largest known of these small, inconspicuous sponges is probably the species *Pericharax heteroraphis*, attaining a height of 30\u00a0cm (0.98\u00a0ft). Most calcareous sponges do not exceed 10\u00a0cm (3.9\u00a0in) tall.[*citation needed*]\nHexactinellid sponges (Hexactinellida)\nA relatively common species, *Rhabdocalyptus dawsoni*, can reach a height of 1\u00a0m (3.3\u00a0ft) once they are of a very old age.[295] This is the maximum size recorded for a hexactinellid sponge.[*citation needed*]\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Largest prehistoric animals\n* Megafauna\n* Largest organisms\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe beetles are the largest order of organisms on earth, with about 400,000 species so far identified. The most massive species are the *Goliathus*, *Megasoma* and *Titanus* beetles already mentioned. Another fairly large species is the Hercules beetle (*Dynastes hercules*) of the neotropic rainforest with a maximum overall length of at least 19\u00a0cm (7.5\u00a0in) including the extremely long pronotal horn. The weight in this species does not exceed 16.5\u00a0g (0.58\u00a0oz).[1] The longest overall beetle is a species of longhorn beetle, *Batocera wallacei*, from New Guinea, which can attain a length of 26.6\u00a0cm (10.5\u00a0in), about 19\u00a0cm (7.5\u00a0in) of which is comprised by the long antennae.[1]\nEarwigs (Dermaptera)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHowever, the toad *Beelzebufo ampinga*, found in fossil from the Cretaceous era in what is now Madagascar, was estimated to grow to 41\u00a0cm (16\u00a0in) long and weigh up to 4.5\u00a0kg (9.9\u00a0lb), making it the largest frog ever known.[177] But in more recent studies, animals of this species have been estimated to have grown to at least 23.2\u00a0cm (9.1\u00a0in) (snout-vent length), which is around the size a modern African bullfrog can reach.[178] The largest tree frog is the Australasian white-lipped tree frog (*Litoria infrafrenata*), the females of which can reach a length of 14\u00a0cm (5.5\u00a0in) from snout to vent and can weigh up to 115\u00a0g (4.1\u00a0oz).[179] The family Leptodactylidae, one of the most diverse anuran families, also has some very large members. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe largest of this widespread, varied complex of insects are the giant wetas of New Zealand, which is now split among 12 species. The largest of these is the Little Barrier Island giant weta (*Deinacrida heteracantha*), the largest specimen was weighed at 71.3\u00a0g (2.52\u00a0oz), one of the largest insects weights ever known. These heavyweight insects can be over 9\u00a0cm (3.5\u00a0in) long.[1] The largest grasshopper species is often considered to be the Australian giant grasshopper (*Valanga irregularis*), which ranges up to 9\u00a0cm (3.5\u00a0in) in length.[268] The American eastern lubber grasshopper (*Romalea guttata*) can allegedly range up to 10\u00a0cm (3.9\u00a0in) in length.[269] However, the greatest grasshopper sizes known, to 12\u00a0cm (4.7\u00a0in), have been cited in the South American giant grasshopper (*Tropidacris violaceus*). \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n101. **^** Ahmad, A.

The largest known specimen of this giant, found washed up on the shore of Massachusetts Bay in 1870,[285][286] had a bell diameter of 2.5\u00a0m (8.2\u00a0ft), a weight of 150\u00a0kg (330\u00a0lb). The tentacles of this specimens were as long as 37\u00a0m (121\u00a0ft) and were projected to have a tentacular spread of about 75\u00a0m (246\u00a0ft) making it one of the longest extant animals.[1]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n(See Cephalopod size.) While generally much smaller than the giant *Architeuthis* and *Mesonychoteuthis*, the largest of the octopuses, the giant Pacific octopus (*Enteroctopus dofleini*), can grow to be very large. The largest confirmed weight of a giant octopus is 74\u00a0kg (163\u00a0lb),[218] with a 7\u00a0m (23\u00a0ft) arm span (with the tentacles fully extended) and a head-to-tentacle-tip length of 3.9\u00a0m (13\u00a0ft).[219] Specimens have been reported up to 125\u00a0kg (276\u00a0lb) but are unverified. A weight of 10 - 50kg is a much more common size.[1]\n### Roundworms (Nematoda)[edit]\n\n\nThe largest roundworm, *Placentonema gigantissima*,[220] is a parasite found in the placentas of sperm whales which can reach up to 9\u00a0m (30\u00a0ft) in length.[221]\n\n\n\n### Velvet worms (Onychophora)[edit]\n\n\nThe largest velvet worm known is Sol\u00f3rzano's velvet worm (*Peripatus solorzanoi*).
