For countries in which the head of state and head of government are separate, both offices are listed. For leaders who held the same office prior to their state's independence, the start of their tenure is used, not independence. For a list of heads of state taking dates of independence into account, see List of heads of state by diplomatic precedence.\n\n\nActing presidents are included in this list, but if a leader has non-consecutive terms, only the current period of service is listed.\n\n\nStates where head of state differs from head of government are mainly parliamentary systems. Often a leader holds both positions in presidential systems or dictatorships. Some states have semi-presidential systems where the head of government role is fulfilled by both the listed head of government and the head of state.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n## List of state leaders by date of assuming office[edit]\n\n\n### Prior to 2000[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 21 December 2006\u00a0 | Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow[28] | ![](image)\u00a0Turkmenistan | Acting President: 21 December 2006\u00a0\u2013 14 February 2007President: 14 February 2007\u00a0\u2013 19 March 2022Chairman of the People's Council: 14 April 2021\u00a0\u2013 present[29] |\n| 10 January 2007\n | Daniel Ortega | ![](image)\u00a0Nicaragua | President[30] |\n| 6 January 2009\n | Sheikh Hasina[31] | ![](image)\u00a0Bangladesh | Prime Minister[32] |\n| 26 February 2009\n | Patrick Allen | ![](image)\u00a0Jamaica | Governor-General[33] |\n\n\n### 2010\u20132014[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 27 April 1991[10] | Isaias Afwerki | ![](image)\u00a0Eritrea | Secretary-General of the Provisional Government: 27 April 1991\u00a0\u2013 23 May 1993President: 23 May 1993\u00a0\u2013 presentChairman of the People's Front: 1 March 1994\u00a0\u2013 present |\n| 19 November 1992\u00a0 | Emomali Rahmon | ![](image)\u00a0Tajikistan | Acting Chairman of the Supreme Council: 19 November 1992\u00a0\u2013 27 November 1992Chairman of the Supreme Council: 27 November 1992\u00a0\u2013 16 November 1994President: 16 November 1994\u00a0\u2013 present\n |\n| 20 July 1994\n | Alexander Lukashenko | ![](image)\u00a0Belarus | President[11] |\n| 7 February 1996\n | Letsie III | ![](image)\u00a0Lesotho | King[12] |\n| 25 October 1997\n | Denis Sassou Nguesso | ![](image) Congo-Brazzaville | President[13] |\n| 3 March 1998\n | Henri | ![](image)\u00a0Luxembourg | Prince-regent: 3 March 1998\u00a0\u2013 7 October 2000Grand Duke: 7 October 2000\u00a0\u2013 present\n |\n| 25 January 1999\n | Abdullah II | ![](image)\u00a0Jordan | Prince-regent: 25 January 1999\u00a0\u2013 7 February 1999King: 7 February 1999\u00a0\u2013 present\n |\n| 6 March 1999\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 15 September 2013\u00a0 | Edi Rama | ![](image)\u00a0Albania | Prime Minister |\n| 23 November 2013\n | Kokhir Rasulzoda | ![](image)\u00a0Tajikistan | Prime Minister |\n| 25 January 2014\n | Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan[43] | ![](image) United Arab Emirates\u00a0 | *de facto* President: 25 January 2014\u00a0\u2013 13 May 2022[44]President: 14 May 2022\u00a0\u2013 present\n |\n| 27 April 2014\n | Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107 | ![](image)\u00a0Serbia | Prime Minister: 27 April 2014\u00a0\u2013 30 May 2017President: 31 May 2017\u00a0\u2013 present\n |\n| 26 May 2014\n | Narendra Modi | ![](image)\u00a0India | Prime Minister |\n| 8 June 2014\n | Abdel Fattah el-Sisi | ![](image)\u00a0Egypt | President |\n| 13 June 2014\n | Gaston Browne | ![](image)\u00a0Antigua and Barbuda | Prime Minister |\n| 19 June 2014\n | Felipe VI | ![](image)\u00a0Spain | King |\n| 14 August 2014\n | Rodney Williams | ![](image)\u00a0Antigua and Barbuda | Governor-General[33] |\n| 20 October 2014\n | Joko Widodo | ![](image)\u00a0Indonesia | President |\n| 21 December 2014\n | Klaus Iohannis | ![](image)\u00a0Romania | President |\n\n\n### 2015\u20132017[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Assumed office | Leader\n | State\n | Office\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 January | Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva | ![](image)\u00a0Brazil | President[113] |\n| \u00c9lisabeth Baume-Schneider\u00a0 | ![](image)\u00a0\u00a0Switzerland | Federal Councilor[38] |\n| Albert R\u00f6sti | Federal Councilor[38] |\n| 5 January | *Dinorah Figuera* | *![](image)\u00a0Venezuela (opposition)* | *President of the National Assembly* |\n| 25 January | Borjana Kri\u0161to | ![](image)\u00a0Bosnia and Herzegovina\u00a0 | Prime Minister |\n| Chris Hipkins | ![](image)\u00a0New Zealand | Prime Minister |\n| 31 January | *Chen Chien-jen* | *![](image)\u00a0Taiwan* | *Premier* |\n| 1 February | Manuela Roka Botey | ![](image)\u00a0Equatorial Guinea | Prime Minister |\n| Marcella Liburd | ![](image)\u00a0Saint Kitts and Nevis | Governor-General[33] |\n| 16 February | Dorin Recean | ![](image)\u00a0Moldova | Prime Minister |\n| 28 February | Nikos Christodoulides | ![](image)\u00a0Cyprus | President |\n| 2 March | V\u00f5 V\u0103n Th\u01b0\u1edfng | ![](image)\u00a0Vietnam | President |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n12. **^** Letsie III was previously King of Lesotho 12 November 1990\u00a0\u2013 25 January 1995.\n13. **^** Denis Sassou Nguesso was previously President of the People's Republic of the Congo / Republic of the Congo 8 February 1979\u00a0\u2013 31 August 1992.

Such calculations are prepared by various organizations, including the IMF and the World Bank. As estimates and assumptions have to be made, the results produced by different organizations for the same country are not hard facts and tend to differ, sometimes substantially, so they should be used with caution.\n\n\nComparisons of national wealth are frequently made on the basis of *nominal* GDP and savings (not just income), which do not reflect differences in the cost of living in different countries (*see List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita*); hence, using a PPP basis is arguably more useful when comparing generalized differences in living standards between economies because PPP takes into account the relative cost of living and the inflation rates of the countries, rather than using only exchange rates, which may distort the real differences in income.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0DR Congo\u202f\\* | Africa | 1,510 | 2023 | 1,337 | 2022 | 1,100 | 2021\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Central African Republic\u202f\\* | Africa | 1,109 | 2023 | 967 | 2022 | 800 | 2021\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Burundi\u202f\\* | Africa | 890 | 2023 | 836 | 2022 | 700 | 2021\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0South Sudan\u202f\\* | Africa | 476 | 2023 | 1,182 | 2015 | 1,600 | 2017\n |\n\n\n### Footnotes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** There is no explicit \"GDP (PPP) per capita\" World estimate provided by the IMF.

However, it is increasingly being recognized that tax havens, or corporate tax havens, have distorted economic data which produces artificially high, or inflated, GDP-per-capita figures.[17] It is estimated that over 15% of global jurisdictions are tax havens (see tax haven lists).[18] An IMF investigation estimates that circa 40% of global foreign direct investment flows, which heavily influence the GDP of various jurisdictions, are described as \"phantom\" transactions.[19]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n> The statistical distortions created by the impact on the Irish National Accounts of the global assets and activities of a handful of large multinational corporations have now become so large as to make a mockery of conventional uses of Irish GDP.\n> \n> \u2014\u200aPatrick Honohan, ex-Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland, 13 July 2016[21]\n> \n\n\nA list of the top 15 GDP-per-capita countries from 2016 to 2017, contains most of the major global tax havens (see GDP-per-capita tax haven proxy for more detail):\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **International Monetary Fund (2017)** | **World Bank (2016)**[22][23] |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Price level\n* Employment/Unemployment\n* Financial assets\n* Labour productivity\n* Wealth\n |\n| * Lists of countries by GDP rankings\n\n\n* List of international rankings\n* Lists by country\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"World Economic Outlook Database, 2019\". *IMF.org*.
