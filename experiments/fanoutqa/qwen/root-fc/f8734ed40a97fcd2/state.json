They may also be seen in family gatherings, such as Barney and Robin's wedding or Marshall's father's funeral. Ted's children and Marvin W. Eriksen (son of Marshall and Lily) appear in the background of many episodes and key moments without being crucial to many plots.\n\n\nRanjit, Carl, and several other characters often appear because they work in places the main cast frequently visit/hang out at (such as MacLaren's Pub). Characters in relationships with Ted, Barney, or Robin often appear in several episodes within a short period of time, such as Victoria, Nora, or Kevin. Minor characters such as the Slutty Pumpkin or Mary the Paralegal may only appear in one or two episodes, but still play a crucial role in the episodes in which they appear.\n\n\n\n\n## Cast table[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)From left to right: Ted, Robin, Barney, Marshall, Lily.\nThe US sitcom *How I Met Your Mother* premiered on CBS on September 19, 2005.

She marries The Captain.\n\n\n\n### Curtis[edit]\n\n\n*Appears in 5 season 9 episodes from \"Coming Back\" to \"Vesuvius\"*\nPlayed by Roger Bart. He is the front desk clerk at the Farhampton Inn, who works there until at least 2024.[27] He is unintentionally condescending to Ted upon learning he is single. When The Mother shows up at the inn in the middle of the night, he gives her a key to Robin's mother's empty room.\n\n\n\n### Alfred Mosby[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHowever, this is the cause of disagreement between the couple as Marshall accepts an offer to be a judge without consulting Lily. Lily is revealed to be pregnant with a second child in \"Daisy\", followed by third child a few years later in \"Last Forever\".\n\n\n\n### The Doppelg\u00e4ngers[edit]\n\n\nIn \"Double Date\", Ted mentions that the group has seen people who look exactly like them. This theme of five doppelg\u00e4ngers, one for each of the main characters (excluding The Mother), continues throughout several episodes.\n\n\nThe first three doppelg\u00e4ngers are seen in \"Double Date\". \"Moustache Marshall\" appears on an advert on the side of a bus, and is spotted by Barney in MacLaren's. \"Lesbian Robin\" is seen in the streets of New York. \"Stripper Lily\" (known by the name \"Jasmine\") works at the Lusty Leopard and also appears in \"46 Minutes\" and \"Gary Blauman\", eventually marrying Scooter. \"Mexican Wrestler Ted\" is discovered in \"Robots Versus Wrestlers\".\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSince the actors playing Ted's children were going to age quickly, stock footage of them was shot in 2006, to be used in later episodes. Additionally, footage for the series finale was shot and the actors were made to sign non-disclosure agreements;[10] Fonseca said in 2013 that she did not \"remember what the secret was\", although Henrie thought he remembered.[11] A season nine promotional video was filmed with the same actors, now adults, joking that they have been listening to Ted tell the story for eight years, and was first shown at the 2013 San Diego Comic-Con.[12]\n\n\n\n###  Marvin W. Eriksen[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTed is shown meeting The Mother in the series finale at the Farhampton train station following Barney and Robin's wedding. They date, get engaged, and have two children called Luke and Penny. In the original ending of the show, The Mother is shown to have been deceased in 2024. Many fans of the show had become emotionally attached to The Mother.[1] In many scenes throughout the show, it was shown how incredibly perfect Ted and Tracy were for each other and how nice she was to everyone. Her death in the series finale was met with considerable dissatisfaction by many viewers.[2][3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n*Appears in 22 episodes from \"Pilot\" to \"Last Forever\"*\nPlayed by Marshall Manesh, Ranjit is a cab driver from Bangladesh. He drives the main characters around during several significant moments of their lives; for instance, he drives Marshall and Lily in a limo shortly after they are married and helps Ted with a \"two-minute date\" in \"Ten Sessions\". In \"The Sexless Innkeeper\", he and his wife Falguni go on a double date with Marshall and Lily, although they do not enjoy it. He also appears in episodes such as \"The Limo\", \"Rabbit or Duck\", \"The Goat\" and \"Three Days of Snow\". In \"Gary Blauman\", Future Ted reveals that Ranjit became rich through investments and bought a limo service.\n\n\nRanjit is the only recurring character to appear in all nine seasons.\n\n\n\n###  Carl the Bartender[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPlayed by Danica McKellar; appears in \"The Pineapple Incident\" and \"Third Wheel\". She ends up in Ted's bed after he gets really drunk. In a later episode, Ted tries to have a threesome with her and another girl, although it is never said whether he did or not.\nProfessor Vinick\nPlayed by Peter Gallagher; appears in \"The Final Page \u2013 Part 1\". He told Ted he'd never make it as an architect, damaging Ted's self-esteem and causing him to bear a grudge.\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Marvin appeared in \"Desperation Day\", \"Noretta\", \"Tailgate\", \"The Pre-Nup\" and \"Sunrise\".\n2. **^** Alfred appeared in a voice-only cameo in the episode \u201cHow Lily Stole Christmas\u201d.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Nick Swisher, a former New York Yankee, walks into MacLaren's during \"Perfect Week\". This attracts the attention of the girl Barney was trying to pick up. His appearance on the show was first announced in December 2009; his episode aired in February 2010.[42][43]\n* Funk musician George Clinton appears in \"Where Were We?\", in a scene imagined by Marshall. Robin Pierson said Clinton's scene was \"pure silliness\" and Marshall's imaginings were \"just a stupid excuse to give Clinton a part on the show\".[44]\n* Game show host Bob Barker appears in \"Showdown\", hosting *The Price is Right* in which Barney competes. Barney claims Bob Barker is his father, a lie told by his mother. Staci Krause said \"Barney's emotional closing words to Bob Barker almost brought tears to [her] eyes\".[45] Pierson said \"the writers handled [Barney's storyline] beautifully\".[46]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n*Appears in 9 episodes from \"The Stinsons\" to \"The End of the Aisle\"*\nPlayed by Frances Conroy, Loretta is Barney's mother. Prior to her first proper appearance, she appeared from the neck down voiced by Megan Mullally in \"Single Stamina\" and \"Showdown\". Loretta had a very promiscuous lifestyle and neither Barney nor James knows who his real father is until they are adults. She also tends to tell ridiculous lies to her sons to cover up bad news, such as saying Barney's father is Bob Barker. So that his mother would not worry about him, Barney hired actors to pretend to be his family; when he is forced to reveal the truth in \"The Stinsons\", Loretta is not upset. She returns in \"Cleaning House\": the gang go to her home as she is planning to move. Though she had hidden the identities of James and Barney's fathers so that she could be both mother and father to them, she eventually discloses who both of their fathers are.\n\n\n\n### Arthur Hobbs[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n Katie Scherbatsky\nPlayed by Lucy Hale; appears in \"First Time in New York\" and \"Vesuvius\". Katie visits Robin (her sister) in New York and Robin reacts badly when she discovers Katie is planning to lose her virginity to a boy named Kyle. *Bustle* ranked her second in a list of best guest stars in the series.[51]\nKlaus\nPlayed by Thomas Lennon; appears in \"Farhampton\" and \"The Pre-Nup\". Klaus is Victoria's fianc\u00e9. They were classmates at Victoria's culinary fellowship in Germany but enter a relationship roughly a day after Ted and Victoria break up.[103] He appears on-screen in \"Farhampton\" as Victoria's groom, but both of them get cold feet at their wedding. The failure of the wedding sends Klaus into a spiral and he briefly stays at Ted's apartment.\nProfessor Lewis\nPlayed by Jane Seymour; appears in \"Aldrin Justice\". Professor Lewis is Marshall's recently divorced law professor who is considered a \"cougar\" by Barney. He has sex with her several times.\nLiddy Gates\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Stella Zinman | Sarah Chalke | Does not appear | Recurring\n | Does not appear | Guest\n | Does not appear |\n| Abby | Britney Spears | Does not appear | Recurring\n | Does not appear |\n| Lucy Zinman | Darcy Rose Byrnes | Does not appear | Guest\n | Recurring\n | Does not appear |\n| Arthur Hobbs | Bob Odenkirk | Does not appear | Guest\n | Does not appear | Guest\n | Recurring\n | Does not appear | Guest\n | Does not appear |\n| Alan Thicke | Himself\n | Does not appear | Guest\n | Does not appear | Guest\n | Does not appear | Guest\n | Does not appear |\n| Meg | April Bowlby | Does not appear | Guest\n | Does not appear | Guest\n | Does not appear | Guest\n | Does not appear |\n| Punchy | Chris Romano | Does not appear | Guest\n | Does not appear | Guest\n | Does not appear |\n| Simon Tremblay | James Van Der Beek | Does not appear | Guest\n | Does not appear | Guest\n | Does not appear |\n| Randy Wharmpess | Will Forte | Does not appear | Guest\n | Does not appear | Guest\n | Does not appear |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBays and Thomas planned to have Victoria as a backup Mother in case CBS decided to cancel the series after season 2.[18][19] Another possible storyline was Williams wearing a fat suit to portray Victoria having become, according to Bays, \"enormously fat\" because of her baking career.[20] Victoria was described as Ted's best girlfriend by *People* magazine.[21]\n\n\n\n### Judy Eriksen[edit]\n\n\n*Appears in 15 episodes from \"Belly Full of Turkey\" to \"Daisy\"*\nPlayed by Suzie Plakson, Judy Eriksen is the mother of Marshall. Married to the late Marvin Eriksen, she has three children: Marvin, Marcus and Marshall. She lives in St. Cloud, Minnesota and is known to have a tense, sometimes adversarial relationship with Lily, leaving Marshall torn as he loves Lily, but has trouble understanding how she could dislike his mother. In \"The Over-Correction,\" she begins a sexual relationship with Lily's father, Mickey.\n\n\n\n### James Stinson[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMarshall eventually is accepted to his dream job, being a judge, after committing to move to Italy with Lily. This leads to constant conflict between the couple through most of the final season. Throughout the first half of the last season, Marshall is on a car ride from Minnesota to Long Island after missing his flight to Barney and Robin's wedding. In this process, Marshall meets The Mother.\n\n\n\n### Robin Scherbatsky[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Robin Scherbatsky\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPlayed by Bryan Cranston; appears in 3 episodes from \"Aldrin Justice\" to \"Platonish\". Druthers is a condescending architect who is Ted's boss at their architecture firm. Druthers designs a building in Spokane, Washington that, according to Ted and Lily, looks like an erect penis; their client accepts Ted's design instead. Druthers is then forced to work under Ted but continues to undermine him. Druthers is fired by Ted (at the instance of their boss) whilst his life is otherwise going downhill. It was announced in 2013 that Cranston would return to the show.[99] In the ninth season (during \"Platonish\"), Druthers offers Ted a new job but Ted declines; an editor for *Vulture* criticized Cranston's appearance in this episode.[100]\nJanice Aldrin\nPlayed by Meagen Fay; appears in 3 episodes from \"Bachelor Party\" to \"The Sexless Innkeeper\". Janice is Lily's mother, who divorced Lily's father (Mickey) in 1985. She and Lily do not have a good relationship.\nJen\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe couple make minor recurring appearances afterward. Stuart attends Marshall's bachelor party in \"Bachelor Party\", where it is suggested he regrets marrying Claudia. He also briefly appears in \"Intervention\". In \"Baby Talk\", he and Claudia are seen to have a daughter named Esther. Stuart makes another appearance in \"The Over-Correction\", where Ted blames him for failing to return Ted's red cowboy boots. In \"The Poker Game\", Stuart claims to have given Marshall and Lily a coffeemaker for their wedding, when it was really Ted's present. In that episode it is also revealed that Stuart has been cheating on Claudia.\n\n\n\n## Guest stars[edit]\n\n\nAs themselves\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
