Eolian processes are major factors in shaping desert landscapes. Polar deserts (also seen as \"cold deserts\") have similar features, except the main form of precipitation is snow rather than rain. Antarctica is the world's largest cold desert (composed of about 98% thick continental ice sheet and 2% barren rock). Some of the barren rock is to be found in the so-called Dry Valleys of Antarctica that almost never get snow, which can have ice-encrusted saline lakes that suggest evaporation far greater than the rare snowfall due to the strong katabatic winds that even evaporate ice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The Sahara is the largest hot desert in the world\nDeserts have been defined and classified in a number of ways, generally combining total precipitation, number of days on which this falls, temperature, and humidity, and sometimes additional factors.[6] For example, Phoenix, Arizona, receives less than 250\u00a0mm (9.8\u00a0in) of precipitation per year, and is immediately recognized as being located in a desert because of its aridity-adapted plants. The North Slope of Alaska's Brooks Range also receives less than 250\u00a0mm (9.8\u00a0in) of precipitation per year and is often classified as a cold desert.[24] Other regions of the world have cold deserts, including areas of the Himalayas[25] and other high-altitude areas in other parts of the world.[26] Polar deserts cover much of the ice-free areas of the Arctic and Antarctic.[27][28] A non-technical definition is that deserts are those parts of Earth's surface that have insufficient vegetation cover to support a human population.[29]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n1. **^** \"desert | National Geographic Society\". *education.nationalgeographic.org*.

These belts are associated with the subtropical anticyclone and the large-scale descent of dry air moving from high-altitudes toward the poles. The Sahara Desert is of this type.[37] Mid-latitude deserts occur between 30\u00b0 and 50\u00b0 North and South. They are mostly in areas remote from the sea where most of the moisture has already precipitated from the prevailing winds. They include the Tengger and Sonoran Deserts.[36] Monsoon deserts are similar. They occur in regions where large temperature differences occur between sea and land. Moist warm air rises over the land, deposits its water content and circulates back to sea. Further inland, areas receive very little precipitation. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Sand and dunes of the Libyan Desert\n![view of high desert through a mountain crevasse](image)Valle de la Luna (\"Moon Valley\") in the Atacama Desert of Chile, the world's driest non-polar desert\nA **desert** is a barren area of landscape where little precipitation occurs and, consequently, living conditions are hostile for plant and animal life. The lack of vegetation exposes the unprotected surface of the ground to denudation. About one-third of the land surface of the Earth is arid or semi-arid. This includes much of the polar regions, where little precipitation occurs, and which are sometimes called polar deserts or \"cold deserts\". Deserts can be classified by the amount of precipitation that falls, by the temperature that prevails, by the causes of desertification or by their geographical location.[1]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n105. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Fagan, Brian M.

The Martian deserts principally consist of dunes in the form of half-moons in flat areas near the permanent polar ice caps in the north of the planet. The smaller dune fields occupy the bottom of many of the craters situated in the Martian polar regions.[143] Examination of the surface of rocks by laser beamed from the Mars Exploration Rover have shown a surface film that resembles the desert varnish found on Earth although it might just be surface dust.[144] The surface of Titan, a moon of Saturn, also has a desert-like surface with dune seas.[145]\n\n\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]\n\n* ![icon](image)Geography portal\n* ![](image)World portal\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Bagnold, Ralph A.

In English before the 20th century, *desert* was often used in the sense of \"unpopulated area\", without specific reference to aridity;[2] but today the word is most often used in its climate-science sense (an area of low precipitation).[3] Phrases such as \"desert island\"[4] and \"Great American Desert\", or Shakespeare's \"deserts of Bohemia\" (*The Winter's Tale*) in previous centuries did not necessarily imply sand or aridity; their focus was the sparse population.[5]\n\n\n\n## Major deserts\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: List of deserts by area\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n47. **^** \"What is a dead zone?\". *NOAA's National Ocean Service*. 2019-03-14.

The South Pacific Gyre is an example of a so-called \"oceanic desert\", visibly low (purple) in organism density. Polar deserts are visible in consistent white and arid deserts in consistent brown, with tundras oscillating between white and brown.\nThe concept of \"biological desert\" redefines the concept of desert, without the characteristic of aridity, not lacking water, but instead lacking life. Such places can be so-called \"ocean deserts\", which are mostly at the centers of gyres, but also hypoxic or anoxic waters such as dead zones.[45][46][47]\n\n\n\n## Morphology\n\n[edit]\n\n### Weathering processes\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Weathering\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDeserts and semi-deserts are home to ecosystems with low or very low biomass and primary productivity in arid or semi-arid climates. They are mostly found in subtropical high-pressure belts and major continental rain shadows. Primary productivity depends on low densities of small photoautotrophs that sustain a sparse trophic network. Plant growth is limited by rainfall, temperature extremes and desiccating winds. Deserts have strong temporal variability in the availability of resources due to the total amount of annual rainfall and the size of individual rainfall events. Resources are often ephemeral or episodic, and this triggers sporadic animal movements and 'pulse and reserve' or 'boom-bust' ecosystem dynamics. Erosion and sedimentation are high due to the sparse vegetation cover and the activities of large mammals and people. Plants and animals in deserts are mostly adapted to extreme and prolonged water deficits, but their reproductive phenology often responds to short episodes of surplus. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOthers, such as brine shrimps, fairy shrimps and tadpole shrimps, are cryptobiotic and can lose up to 92% of their bodyweight, rehydrating as soon as it rains and their temporary pools reappear.[104]\n\n\n\n## Human relations\n\n[edit]\n\nHumans have long made use of deserts as places to live,[105] and more recently have started to exploit them for minerals[106] and energy capture.[107] Deserts play a significant role in human culture with an extensive literature.[108] Deserts can only support a limited population of both humans and animals.[109]\n\n\n\n### History\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n9. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Marshak (2009). *Essentials of Geology, 3rd ed*.

Winter temperatures vary considerably between different deserts and are often related to the location of the desert on the continental landmass and the latitude. Daily variations in temperature can be as great as 22\u00a0\u00b0C (40\u00a0\u00b0F) or more, with heat loss by radiation at night being increased by the clear skies.[32]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n16. **^** Mckay, Christopher P.

However, such factors as the temperature, humidity, rate of evaporation and evapotranspiration, and the moisture storage capacity of the ground have a marked effect on the degree of aridity and the plant and animal life that can be sustained. Rain falling in the cold season may be more effective at promoting plant growth, and defining the boundaries of deserts and the semiarid regions that surround them on the grounds of precipitation alone is problematic.[32]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nCold deserts, sometimes known as temperate deserts, occur at higher latitudes than hot deserts, and the aridity is caused by the dryness of the air. Some cold deserts are far from the ocean and others are separated by mountain ranges from the sea, and in both cases, there is insufficient moisture in the air to cause much precipitation. The largest of these deserts are found in Central Asia. Others occur on the eastern side of the Rocky Mountains, the eastern side of the southern Andes and in southern Australia.[11] Polar deserts are a particular class of cold desert. The air is very cold and carries little moisture so little precipitation occurs and what does fall, usually snow, is carried along in the often strong wind and may form blizzards, drifts and dunes similar to those caused by dust and sand in other desert regions. In Antarctica, for example, the annual precipitation is about 50\u00a0mm (2\u00a0in) on the central plateau and some ten times that amount on some major peninsulas.[32]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPolar deserts such as McMurdo Dry Valleys remain ice-free because of the dry katabatic winds that flow downhill from the surrounding mountains.[42] Former desert areas presently in non-arid environments, such as the Sandhills in Nebraska, are known as paleodeserts.[36] In the K\u00f6ppen climate classification system, deserts are classed as *BWh* (hot desert) or *BWk* (temperate desert). In the Thornthwaite climate classification system, deserts would be classified as arid megathermal climates.[43][44]\n\n\n\n### Polar desert\n\n[edit]\n\nPolar deserts are a type of cold desert.

Other landforms include plains largely covered by gravels and angular boulders, from which the finer particles have been stripped by the wind. These are called \"reg\" in the western Sahara, \"serir\" in the eastern Sahara, \"gibber plains\" in Australia and \"sa\u00ef\" in central Asia.[64] The Tassili Plateau in Algeria is a jumble of eroded sandstone outcrops, canyons, blocks, pinnacles, fissures, slabs and ravines. In some places the wind has carved holes or arches, and in others, it has created mushroom-like pillars narrower at the base than the top.[65] On the Colorado Plateau, it is water that has been the prevailing eroding force. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Europe | * Bardenas Reales\n* Cabo de Gata\n* Monegros\n* Oleshky\n* Tabernas\n* Deliblato\n |\n| North America | * Alvord\n* Amargosa\n* Baja California\n* Black Rock\n* Carcross\n* Carson\n* Channeled scablands\n* Chihuahuan\n* Colorado\n* Escalante\n* Forty Mile\n* Gran Desierto de Altar\n* Great Basin\n* Great Salt Lake\n* Great Sandy\n* Jornada del Muerto\n* Ka\u02bb\u016b\n* Lechuguilla\n* Mojave\n* North American Arctic\n* Owyhee\n* Painted Desert\n* Red Desert\n* Sevier\n* Smoke Creek\n* Sonoran\n* Tonopah Desert\n* Tule (Arizona)\n* Tule (Nevada)\n* Yuha\n* Yuma\n |\n| Oceania | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Australia | * Gibson\n* Great Sandy\n* Great Victoria\n* Little Sandy\n* Nullarbor Plain\n* Painted\n* Pedirka\n* Simpson\n* Strzelecki\n* Sturt Stony\n* Tanami\n* Tirari\n |\n| New Zealand | * Rangipo\n |\n\n |\n| South America | * Atacama\n* La Guajira\n* Los M\u00e9danos de Coro\n* Monte\n* Patagonian\n* Sechura\n* Tatacoa\n |\n| Polar regions | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n29. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Dickson, Henry Newton (1911). \"Desert\"\u00a0.

Orographic lift occurs as air masses rise to pass over high ground. In the process they cool and lose much of their moisture by precipitation on the windward slope of the mountain range. When they descend on the leeward side, they warm and their capacity to hold moisture increases so an area with relatively little precipitation occurs.[38] The Taklamakan Desert is an example, lying in the rain shadow of the Himalayas and receiving less than 38\u00a0mm (1.5\u00a0in) precipitation annually.[39] Other areas are arid by virtue of being a very long way from the nearest available sources of moisture.[40]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPeople have struggled to live in deserts and the surrounding semi-arid lands for millennia. Nomads have moved their flocks and herds to wherever grazing is available, and oases have provided opportunities for a more settled way of life. The cultivation of semi-arid regions encourages erosion of soil and is one of the causes of increased desertification. Desert farming is possible with the aid of irrigation, and the Imperial Valley in California provides an example of how previously barren land can be made productive by the import of water from an outside source. Many trade routes have been forged across deserts, especially across the Sahara, and traditionally were used by caravans of camels carrying salt, gold, ivory and other goods. Large numbers of slaves were also taken northwards across the Sahara. Some mineral extraction also takes place in deserts, and the uninterrupted sunlight gives potential for the capture of large quantities of solar energy.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1961, Peveril Meigs divided desert regions on Earth into three categories according to the amount of precipitation they received. In this now widely accepted system, extremely arid lands have at least twelve consecutive months without precipitation, arid lands have less than 250\u00a0mm (9.8\u00a0in) of annual precipitation, and semiarid lands have a mean annual precipitation of between 250 and 500\u00a0mm (9.8 and 19.7\u00a0in). Both extremely arid and arid lands are considered to be deserts while semiarid lands are generally referred to as steppes when they are grasslands.[6]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOil and gas form on the bottom of shallow seas when micro-organisms decompose under anoxic conditions and later become covered with sediment. Many deserts were at one time the sites of shallow seas and others have had underlying hydrocarbon deposits transported to them by the movement of tectonic plates.[118]\nSome major oilfields such as Ghawar are found under the sands of Saudi Arabia.[106] Geologists believe that other oil deposits were formed by aeolian processes in ancient deserts as may be the case with some of the major American oil fields.[106]\n\n\n\n### Farming\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Desert farming\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe McMurdo dry valleys of Antarctica, which lack water (whether rain, ice, or snow) much like a non-polar desert and even have such desert features as hypersaline lakes and intermittent streams that resemble (except for being frozen at their surfaces) hot or cold deserts for extreme aridity and lack of precipitation of any kind. Extreme winds and not seasonal heat desiccate these nearly-lifeless terrains.\n\n\n\n### Biological desert\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n92. **^** Vann Jones, Kerstin. \"What secrets lie within the camel's hump?\".

At depths of more than 50\u00a0cm (20\u00a0in), these remain at between 30 and 32\u00a0\u00b0C (86 and 90\u00a0\u00b0F) regardless of the external temperature.[93] Jerboas, desert rats, kangaroo rats and other small rodents emerge from their burrows at night and so do the foxes, coyotes, jackals and snakes that prey on them. Kangaroos keep cool by increasing their respiration rate, panting, sweating and moistening the skin of their forelegs with saliva.[94] Mammals living in cold deserts have developed greater insulation through warmer body fur and insulating layers of fat beneath the skin. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n87. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Mellanby, Kenneth (1942). \"Metabolic water and desiccation\". *Nature*. **150** (3792): 21.

Other desert features include rock outcrops, exposed bedrock and clays once deposited by flowing water. Temporary lakes may form and salt pans may be left when waters evaporate. There may be underground sources of water, in the form of springs and seepages from aquifers. Where these are found, oases can occur.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCoastal deserts are mostly found on the western edges of continental land masses in regions where cold currents approach the land or cold water upwellings rise from the ocean depths. The cool winds crossing this water pick up little moisture and the coastal regions have low temperatures and very low rainfall, the main precipitation being in the form of fog and dew. The range of temperatures on a daily and annual scale is relatively low, being 11\u00a0\u00b0C (20\u00a0\u00b0F) and 5\u00a0\u00b0C (9\u00a0\u00b0F) respectively in the Atacama Desert. Deserts of this type are often long and narrow and bounded to the east by mountain ranges. They occur in Namibia, Chile, southern California and Baja California. Other coastal deserts influenced by cold currents are found in Western Australia, the Arabian Peninsula and Horn of Africa, and the western fringes of the Sahara.[32]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPlants and animals living in the desert need special adaptations to survive in the harsh environment. Plants tend to be tough and wiry with small or no leaves, water-resistant cuticles, and often spines to deter herbivory. Some annual plants germinate, bloom and die in the course of a few weeks after rainfall, while other long-lived plants survive for years and have deep root systems able to tap underground moisture. Animals need to keep cool and find enough food and water to survive. Many are nocturnal, and stay in the shade or underground during the heat of the day. They tend to be efficient at conserving water, extracting most of their needs from their food and concentrating their urine. Some animals remain in a state of dormancy for long periods, ready to become active again during the rare rainfall. They then reproduce rapidly while conditions are favorable before returning to dormancy.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n57. **^** \"Sand Plains/Sand Sheets\". *Desert Guide*.

Many locations within this category have elevations exceeding 3,000\u00a0m (9,800\u00a0ft) and the thermal regime can be hemiboreal. These places owe their profound aridity (the average annual precipitation is often less than 40\u00a0mm or 1.5\u00a0in) to being very far from the nearest available sources of moisture and are often in the lee of mountain ranges. Montane deserts are normally cold, or may be scorchingly hot by day and very cold by night as is true of the northeastern slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro.[41]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAnimals adapted to live in deserts are called xerocoles. There is no evidence that body temperature of mammals and birds is adaptive to the different climates, either of great heat or cold. In fact, with a very few exceptions, their basal metabolic rate is determined by body size, irrespective of the climate in which they live.[81] Many desert animals (and plants) show especially clear evolutionary adaptations for water conservation or heat tolerance and so are often studied in comparative physiology, ecophysiology, and evolutionary physiology. One well-studied example is the specializations of mammalian kidneys shown by desert-inhabiting species.[82] Many examples of convergent evolution have been identified in desert organisms, including between cacti and Euphorbia, kangaroo rats and jerboas, *Phrynosoma* and *Moloch* lizards.[83]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSimilar damage is being done today to the semi-arid areas that rim deserts and about twelve million hectares of land are being turned to desert each year.[115] Desertification is caused by such factors as drought, climatic shifts, tillage for agriculture, overgrazing and deforestation. Vegetation plays a major role in determining the composition of the soil. In many environments, the rate of erosion and run off increases dramatically with reduced vegetation cover.[116]\n\n\n\n### Natural resource extraction\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPeople have been living in deserts for millennia. Many, such as the Bushmen in the Kalahari, the Aborigines in Australia and various tribes of North American Indians, were originally hunter-gatherers. They developed skills in the manufacture and use of weapons, animal tracking, finding water, foraging for edible plants and using the things they found in their natural environment to supply their everyday needs. Their self-sufficient skills and knowledge were passed down through the generations by word of mouth.[105] Other cultures developed a nomadic way of life as herders of sheep, goats, cattle, camels, yaks, llamas or reindeer. They travelled over large areas with their herds, moving to new pastures as seasonal and erratic rainfall encouraged new plant growth. They took with them their tents made of cloth or skins draped over poles and their diet included milk, blood and sometimes meat.[110]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA semi-arid desert or a steppe is a version of the arid desert with much more rainfall, vegetation and higher humidity. These regions feature a semi-arid climate and are less extreme than regular deserts.[34] Like arid deserts, temperatures can vary greatly in semi deserts. They share some characteristics of a true desert and are usually located at the edge of deserts and continental dry areas. They usually receive precipitation from 250 to 500\u00a0mm (9.8 to 19.7\u00a0in) but this can vary due to evapotranspiration and soil nutrition. Semi deserts can be found in the Tabernas Desert (and some of the Spanish Plateau), The Sahel, The Eurasian Steppe, most of Central Asia, the Western US, most of Northern Mexico, portions of South America (especially in Argentina) and the Australian Outback.[35] They usually feature *BSh* (hot steppe) or *BSk* (temperate steppe) in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nwriting over twenty books on her experiences.[139] The German naturalist Uwe George spent several years living in deserts, recording his experiences and research in his book, *In the Deserts of this Earth*.[140]\n\n\nThe American poet Robert Frost expressed his bleak thoughts in his poem, *Desert Places*, which ends with the stanza \"They cannot scare me with their empty spaces / Between stars \u2013 on stars where no human race is. / I have it in me so much nearer home / To scare myself with my own desert places.\"[141]\n\n\n\n## Deserts on other planets\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Desert planets\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDeserts present a very challenging environment for animals. Not only do they require food and water but they also need to keep their body temperature at a tolerable level. In many ways, birds are the ablest to do this of the higher animals. They can move to areas of greater food availability as the desert blooms after local rainfall and can fly to faraway waterholes. In hot deserts, gliding birds can remove themselves from the over-heated desert floor by using thermals to soar in the cooler air at great heights. In order to conserve energy, other desert birds run rather than fly. The cream-colored courser flits gracefully across the ground on its long legs, stopping periodically to snatch up insects. Like other desert birds, it is well-camouflaged by its coloring and can merge into the landscape when stationary. The sandgrouse is an expert at this and nests on the open desert floor dozens of kilometers (miles) away from the waterhole it needs to visit daily. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nInvertebrates, particularly arthropods, have successfully made their homes in the desert. Flies, beetles, ants, termites, locusts, millipedes, scorpions and spiders[100] have hard cuticles which are impervious to water and many of them lay their eggs underground and their young develop away from the temperature extremes at the surface.[101] The Saharan silver ant (*Cataglyphis bombycina*) uses a heat shock protein in a novel way and forages in the open during brief forays in the heat of the day.[102] The long-legged darkling beetle in Namibia stands on its front legs and raises its carapace to catch the morning mist as condensate, funnelling the water into its mouth.[103] Some arthropods make use of the ephemeral pools that form after rain and complete their life cycle in a matter of days. The desert shrimp does this, appearing \"miraculously\" in new-formed puddles as the dormant eggs hatch. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n73. **^** Keith, DA (2020). \"T5. Deserts and semi-deserts biome\".

Cold deserts often have high concentrations of salt in the soil. Grasses and low shrubs are the dominant vegetation here and the ground may be covered with lichens. Most shrubs have spiny leaves and shed them in the coldest part of the year.[80]\n\n\n\n### Fauna\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Xerocole\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDeserts contain substantial mineral resources, sometimes over their entire surface, giving them their characteristic colors. For example, the red of many sand deserts comes from laterite minerals.[117] Geological processes in a desert climate can concentrate minerals into valuable deposits. Leaching by ground water can extract ore minerals and redeposit them, according to the water table, in concentrated form.[106] Similarly, evaporation tends to concentrate minerals in desert lakes, creating dry lake beds or playas rich in minerals. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBeing ectotherms, reptiles are unable to live in cold deserts but are well-suited to hot ones. In the heat of the day in the Sahara, the temperature can rise to 50\u00a0\u00b0C (122\u00a0\u00b0F). Reptiles cannot survive at this temperature and lizards will be prostrated by heat at 45\u00a0\u00b0C (113\u00a0\u00b0F). They have few adaptations to desert life and are unable to cool themselves by sweating so they shelter during the heat of the day. In the first part of the night, as the ground radiates the heat absorbed during the day, they emerge and search for prey. Lizards and snakes are the most numerous in arid regions and certain snakes have developed a novel method of locomotion that enables them to move sidewards and navigate high sand-dunes. These include the horned viper of Africa and the sidewinder of North America, evolutionarily distinct but with similar behavioural patterns because of convergent evolution. Many desert reptiles are ambush predators and often bury themselves in the sand, waiting for prey to come within range.[96]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Negev Desert, Israel, and the surrounding area, including the Arava Valley, receive plenty of sunshine and are generally not arable. This has resulted in the construction of many solar plants.[107] David Faiman has proposed that \"giant\" solar plants in the Negev could supply all of Israel's needs for electricity.[127]\n\n\n\n### Warfare\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Desert warfare\n\n![Battle of El Alamein](image)War in the desert: Battle of El Alamein, 1942\nThe Arabs were probably the first organized force to conduct successful battles in the desert. By knowing back routes and the locations of oases and by utilizing camels, Muslim Arab forces were able to successfully overcome both Roman and Persian forces in the period 600 to 700 AD during the expansion of the Islamic caliphate.[129]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThere is an extensive literature on the subject of deserts.[108] An early historical account is that of Marco Polo (c.\u20091254\u20131324), who travelled through Central Asia to China, crossing a number of deserts in his twenty four year trek.[135] Some accounts give vivid descriptions of desert conditions, though often accounts of journeys across deserts are interwoven with reflection, as is the case in Charles Montagu Doughty's major work, *Travels in Arabia Deserta* (1888).[136] Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry described both his flying and the desert in *Wind, Sand and Stars*[137] and Gertrude Bell travelled extensively in the Arabian desert in the early part of the 20th century, becoming an expert on the subject, writing books and advising the British government on dealing with the Arabs.[138] Another woman explorer was Freya Stark, who travelled alone in the Middle East, visiting Turkey, Arabia, Yemen, Syria, Persia and Afghanistan, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n121. **^** Smith, Chuck (2002-10-14). \"Agricultural Societies In Pre-European Times: Southwestern U.S. and Northwestern Mexico\". *Native Peoples of North America*.

This may have happened when drought caused the death of herd animals, forcing herdsmen to turn to cultivation. With few inputs, they were at the mercy of the weather and may have lived at bare subsistence level. The land they cultivated reduced the area available to nomadic herders, causing disputes over land. The semi-arid fringes of the desert have fragile soils which are at risk of erosion when exposed, as happened in the American Dust Bowl in the 1930s. The grasses that held the soil in place were ploughed under, and a series of dry years caused crop failures, while enormous dust storms blew the topsoil away. Half a million Americans were forced to leave their land in this catastrophe.[114]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![desert iguana sunning on a rock](image)The desert iguana (*Dipsosaurus dorsalis*) is well-adapted to desert life.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDeserts are formed by weathering processes as large variations in temperature between day and night put strains on the rocks, which consequently break in pieces. Although rain seldom occurs in deserts, there are occasional downpours that can result in flash floods. Rain falling on hot rocks can cause them to shatter, and the resulting fragments and rubble strewn over the desert floor are further eroded by the wind. This picks up particles of sand and dust, which can remain airborne for extended periods \u2013 sometimes causing the formation of sand storms or dust storms. Wind-blown sand grains striking any solid object in their path can abrade the surface. Rocks are smoothed down, and the wind sorts sand into uniform deposits. The grains end up as level sheets of sand or are piled high in billowing sand dunes. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n98. **^** Withers, P.C.
