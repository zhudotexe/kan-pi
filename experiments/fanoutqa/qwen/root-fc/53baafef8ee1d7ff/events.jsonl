Besides the *Star Wars* and *Superman* franchises, *James Bond* and *Godzilla* films are still being released periodically; all four are among the highest-grossing franchises. Some of the older films that held the record of highest-grossing film still have respectable grosses by today's standards, but no longer compete numerically against today's top-earners in an era of much higher individual ticket prices. When those prices are adjusted for inflation, however, then *Gone with the Wind*—which was the highest-grossing film outright for twenty-five years—is still the highest-grossing film of all time.

Grosses are not limited to original theatrical runs either, with many older films often being re-released periodically so the figures represent all the business a film has done since its original release; a film's first-run gross is included in brackets after the total if known. Because of incomplete data it cannot be known for sure how much money some films have made and when they made it, but generally the chart chronicles the films from each year that went on to earn the most.

Once revenue from home entertainment is factored in, it is not immediately clear which film is the most successful. *Titanic* earned $1.2 billion from video and DVD sales and rentals,[1] in addition to the $2.2 billion it grossed in theatres.

Besides the *Star Wars* and *Superman* franchises, *James Bond* and *Godzilla* films are still being released periodically; all four are among the highest-grossing franchises. Some of the older films that held the record of highest-grossing film still have respectable grosses by today's standards, but no longer compete numerically against today's top-earners in an era of much higher individual ticket prices. When those prices are adjusted for inflation, however, then *Gone with the Wind*—which was the highest-grossing film outright for twenty-five years—is still the highest-grossing film of all time.
