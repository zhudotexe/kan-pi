stone settlement and salt production facility approximately six millennia ago;[117] it flourished ca 4700–4200 BC.[118] The settlement was walled to protect the salt, a crucial commodity in antiquity.[119] Although its population has been estimated at only 350,[119] archaeologist Vassil Nikolov argues that it meets established criteria as a prehistoric city.[124] A large collection of the oldest gold objects in the world find nearby, on the site of the Varna Necropolis, has led archaeologists to speculate that this trade resulted in considerable wealth for the town's residents.[117] |\n| L'Anse aux Meadows | ![](image) | Canada | North America | c. 1000 AD\n | Settlement\n | Located on the northernmost tip of the island of Newfoundland, the Norse settlement is
