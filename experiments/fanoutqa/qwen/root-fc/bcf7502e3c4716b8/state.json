All 193 member states of the United Nations plus the two observer states are given a rank number. Largely unrecognised states not in ISO 3166-1 are included in the list in ranked order.

China's coastal and territorial water figures are unknown (no official publication) and thus cannot be added into China's total area figure. But Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica specifies the United States' area excluding coastal and territorial waters as 9,525,067 km2,[6] less than the figure given for China's area by any of the three sources.
