They became universities in 1963 and 1961 respectively.\n\n\n\n\n## Medieval origins[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Medieval university\n\nThe university as an institution was historically rooted in medieval society, which it in turn influenced and shaped. Academic historian Walter R\u00fcegg asserts that:[12]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 1499[5] | Complutense University of Madrid | ![Pennant of the Crown of Castile](image) Crown of Castile | ![Spain](image) Madrid, Spain\n | A *studium generale* was founded by Sancho IV of Castile in 1293 in Alcal\u00e1 de Henares. Very little is known of this institution over the next two centuries.[66] In 1499 a papal bull was granted by Pope Alexander VI authorising Archbishop Cisneros to establish a *Colegio Mayor* in Alcal\u00e1 with the same powers as the universities of Salamanca and Vallodolid, from which date Verger considers it a university.[5] The new university opened in 1509.[67] The university was moved to Madrid in 1836 by royal decree.[68] |\n| 1500[5] | University of Valencia | ![Standard of the Crown of Aragon](image) Crown of Aragon | ![Spain](image) Valencia, Spain\n |  |\n\n\n## Oldest universities by country or region after 1500 still in operation[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Southern and Western Europe (from the 11th or 12th century)\n* Central and Northern Europe (from the 14th or 15th century)\n* Americas (from the 16th century)\n* Australia (from the 19th century)\n* Asia and Africa (from the 19th or 20th century), with the exception of the Philippines, where the University of Santo Tomas was established in the 17th century.\n\n\n## Founded as universities before 1500[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of medieval universities\n\nThis list includes medieval universities that were founded before 1500 and which have retained institutional continuity since then (excluding not only those that ceased to exist, but also those that merged into or split away to an institution which is regarded as newly established). Several of these have been closed for brief periods: for example the University of Siena was closed 1805\u20131815 during the Napoleonic wars, and universities in the Czech Republic and Poland were closed during Nazi occupation, 1938\u20131945.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe majority of European countries had universities by 1500. Many universities were established at institutes of learning such as schools and colleges that may have been founded significantly earlier but were not classed as universities upon their foundation; this is normally described in the notes for that institution. In some countries (particularly the US and those influenced by its culture), degree-granting higher education institutions that would normally be called universities are instead called colleges. In this case, both the oldest institution that would normally be regarded as a university and the oldest institution (if different) to actually be called a university are given. In many parts of the world, the first university to have a presence was an institution based elsewhere (often the University of London via the affiliation of a local college); where this is different from the first locally established university, both are given.\n\n\n\n### Africa[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| ![](image)\u00a0Guam | ![](image)\u00a0Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands | University of Guam | 1965 (degree granting; college 1952; university 1968) |  |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Papua New Guinea | ![](image)\u00a0Papua New Guinea | University of Papua New Guinea | 1965 | First university in Papua New Guinea.\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0New Zealand(![](image)\u00a0Otago) | ![](image) New Zealand(Dunedin) | University of Otago | 1869 | Oldest in New Zealand.\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0New Zealand(Auckland) | University of Auckland | 1883 | Oldest in the North Island.\n |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of Islamic seminaries \u00a7\u00a0List of oldest Islamic seminaries\n* List of medieval universities\n* List of oldest institutions in continuous operation\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n101. **^** Quennie Ann J.

To be included in the list below, the university must have been founded before 1500 in Europe or be the oldest university derived from the medieval European model in a country or region.

In 1189 the masters made an agreement with the commune not to transfer the *studium* to another town, while the Lombard students were organised into a 'nation' by 1191.[16][19] |\n| 1200\u20131214[20](teaching from c. 1096)\n | University of Oxford | ![](image)\u00a0Kingdom of England | ![United Kingdom](image) Oxford, United Kingdom\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nListed by R\u00fcegg in A History of the University in Europe as meeting standard criteria for recognition as a university from 1832.[124]\nEstablished under the authority of the University of Durham Act 1832.[127] Recognised as a university in the Municipal Corporations Act 1835 and the Established Church Act 1836.[128][129] Incorporated and confirmed by Royal Charter in 1837 and degrees granted equal privileges with those of Oxford and Cambridge by the Attorneys and Solicitors Act 1837.[130][131]\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0United Kingdom(![](image)\u00a0England)(London) | ![](image) United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland | University of London | 1836[124] | Claims to be the third oldest university in England on the basis of the date of its charter.[132]\nListed by R\u00fcegg as meeting standard criteria for recognition as a university from 1836.[124]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| ![](image)\u00a0Lithuania(Vilnius) | ![](image) Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth(Vilnius) | Vilnius University | 1579 (continuous operation since 1919) | Founded as the Jesuit Academy of Vilnius; the university was closed from 1832 to 1919 and again in 1943\u201344\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Luxembourg(Esch-sur-Alzette) | University of Luxembourg | 2003 |  |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Malta(Msida) | ![Sovereign Military Order of Malta](image) Hospitaller Malta(Valletta) | University of Malta | 1769 | First established as the Collegium Melitense by the Jesuits in 1592\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Netherlands(Leiden) | ![](image)\u00a0Dutch Republic(Leiden) | Leiden University | 1575 | Although formally still part of the Habsburg Netherlands, Leiden sided with the Dutch Revolt in 1572\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Netherlands(Groningen) | ![](image)\u00a0Dutch Republic(Groningen) | University of Groningen | 1614 | Together with Leiden University, it was one of the only two Dutch universities to retain their status during the Napoleonic occupation of the Netherlands. |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| ![](image)\u00a0France(Paris) | ![](image)\u00a0Kingdom of France(Paris) | Sorbonne University | 1150\u20131250 (continuous operation since 1896) | Emerged around 1150 as a corporation associated with the cathedral school of Notre Dame de Paris, it was considered the second-oldest university in Europe.
