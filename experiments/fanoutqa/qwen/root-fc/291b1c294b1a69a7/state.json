In 2018 the *unit\u00e9 urbaine* had a population of 10,816,803 in 2,854\u00a0km2 (1,102\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).[2] The Paris Region, or \u00cele-de-France, covers 12,012\u00a0km2 (4,638\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), and has its own regional council and president. It has a population of 12,213,447 as of January 2018, or 18.3 percent of the population of France.[2] The metropolitan or functional area (*aire d'attraction*) of Paris covers 18,941\u00a0km2 (7,313\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) and has 13,064,617 inhabitants (2018).[2]\n\n\nThe population of the city of Paris reached a historic high of 2.9 million in 1921 but then declined; between 1954 and 1999 it declined at every census, falling to 2,125,246 in 1999.[3] After that it began to climb again, reaching 2,240,621 in 2012, but falling to 2,187,526 in 2017.[4]\n\n\nThe city's population loss reflected the experience of most other core cities in the developed world that have not expanded their boundaries. The principal factors in the process were a significant decline in household size, and a dramatic migration of residents to the suburbs between 1962 and 1975. Factors in the migration included deindustrialisation, high rent, the gentrification of many inner quarters, the transformation of living space into offices, and greater affluence among working families. The city's population loss was one of the most severe among international municipalities and the largest for any that had achieved more than 2,000,000 residents. Since then, an influx of younger residents and immigrants has contributed to the growth of the city.\n\n\n\n\n## Density\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Paris population pyramid in 2022\nAccording to Eurostat, the EU statistical agency, in 2012 the Commune of Paris was the most densely populated city in the European Union, with 21,616 people per square kilometre within the city limits (the NUTS-3 statistical area), ahead of Inner London West, which had 10,374 persons per square kilometre. According to the same census, three departments bordering Paris, Hauts-de-Seine, Seine-Saint-Denis and Val-de-Marne, had population densities of over ten thousand persons per square kilometre, ranking among the ten most densely populated areas of the EU.[5]\n\n\nParis is one of the most densely populated cities in the world.[6] Its density, excluding the outlying woodland parks of Boulogne and Vincennes, was 24,448 inhabitants per square kilometre (63,320/sq\u00a0mi) in the 1999 official census, which could be compared only with some Asian megapolises and the New York City borough of Manhattan. Even including the two woodland areas, its population density was 20,755/km2 (53,760/sq\u00a0mi) in 2017,[7] the sixth-most-densely populated commune in France after Levallois-Perret, Vincennes, Le Pr\u00e9-Saint-Gervais, Saint-Mand\u00e9 and Montrouge, all of which border the city proper.\n\n\nThe most sparsely populated quarters are the western and central office and administration-focused *arrondissements*. The city's population is densest in the northern and eastern arrondissements; the 11th arrondissement had a density of 40,672 inhabitants per square kilometre (105,340/sq\u00a0mi) in 1999, and some of the same arrondissement's eastern quarters had densities close to 100,000/km2 (260,000/sq\u00a0mi) in the same year.\n\n\n\n![](image)Population density map of Paris in January 2017\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n| Arrondissement\n | Area (km2)\n | Population\n | Population per km2 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 01 | 1.826\n | 17,268\n | 9,457\n |\n| 02 | 0.992\n | 22,558\n | 22,740\n |\n| 03 | 1.171\n | 36,727\n | 31,364\n |\n| 04 | 1.601\n | 28,068\n | 17,532\n |\n| 05 | 2.541\n | 61,080\n | 24,038\n |\n| 06 | 2.154\n | 44,154\n | 20,499\n |\n| 07 | 4.088\n | 58,166\n | 14,228\n |\n| 08 | 3.881\n | 39,409\n | 10,154\n |\n| 09 | 2.179\n | 60,293\n | 27,670\n |\n| 10 | 2.892\n | 95,436\n | 33,000\n |\n| 11 | 3.666\n | 156,831\n | 42,780\n |\n| 12 | 6.377\n | 146,527\n | 22,977\n |\n| 13 | 7.146\n | 184,235\n | 25,782\n |\n| 14 | 5.621\n | 142,535\n | 25,358\n |\n| 15 | 8.502\n | 240,723\n | 28,314\n |\n| 16 | 7.846\n | 170,239\n | 21,698\n |\n| 17 | 5.669\n | 171,945\n | 30,331\n |\n| 18 | 6.005\n | 202,780\n | 33,769\n |\n| 19 | 6.786\n | 187,799\n | 27,674\n |\n| 20 | 5.984\n | 199,113\n | 33,274\n |\n| Paris | 105.400\n | 2,265,886\n | 21,498\n |\n\n | \n\n|  | inhabitants per km2 |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | 09,000 - 12,000\n |\n|  | 12,000 - 15,000\n |\n|  | 15,000 - 18,000\n |\n|  | 18,000 - 21,000\n |\n|  | 21,000 - 24,000\n |\n|  | 24,000 - 27,000\n |\n|  | 27,000 - 30,000\n |\n|  | 30,000 - 33,000\n |\n|  | 33,000 - 36,000\n |\n|  | 36,000 - 39,000\n |\n|  | 39,000 - 42,000\n |\n|  | 42,000 - 45,000\n |\n\n |\n\n\nNotes: Without the Bois de Boulogne and the Bois de Vincennes.\nReferences: INSEE[8]\n## Paris agglomeration\n\n[edit]\n\nThe city of Paris covers an area much smaller than the urban area of which it is the core. At present, Paris's real urbanisation, defined by the p\u00f4le urbain (urban cluster) statistical area, covers 2,845\u00a0km2 (1,098\u00a0sq\u00a0mi),[9] or an area about 27 times larger than the city itself. The administration of Paris's urban growth is divided between itself and its surrounding departments: Paris's closest ring of three adjoining departments, or petite couronne (\"small ring\") are fully saturated with urban growth, and the ring of four departments outside of these, the grande couronne departments, are only covered in their inner regions by Paris's urbanisation. These eight departments form the larger administrative \u00cele-de-France r\u00e9gion; most of this region is filled, and overextended in places, by the Paris aire urbaine, which, in 2017, was populated by over 12 million people.[10]\n\n\nThe Paris agglomeration has shown a steady rate of growth since the end of the late 16th century French Wars of Religion, save brief setbacks during the French Revolution and World War II. With an estimated total of 12.2\u00a0million inhabitants for 2017, the annual population growth rate of the \u00cele-de-France r\u00e9gion lied between 0.3% and 0.9% over the past 50 years.[11]\n\n\n\n## Immigration\n\n[edit]\n\n\n\n2019 Census Paris Region (*\u00cele-de-France*)[12][13]\n| Country/territory of birth | Population\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![France](image) Metropolitan France | 9,215,134\n |\n| ![Algeria](image) Algeria | 330,935\n |\n| ![Morocco](image) Morocco | 253,518\n |\n| ![Portugal](image) Portugal | 234,399\n |\n| ![Tunisia](image) Tunisia | 127,827\n |\n| ![](image) Guadeloupe | 81,269\n |\n| ![](image) Martinique | 75,959\n |\n| ![China](image) China | 71,500\n |\n| ![Turkey](image) Turkey | 67,982\n |\n| ![Mali](image) Mali | 66,085\n |\n| ![Ivory Coast](image) C\u00f4te d'Ivoire | 63,810\n |\n| ![Senegal](image) Senegal | 60,124\n |\n| ![Italy](image) Italy | 58,141\n |\n| ![Romania](image) Romania | 53,848\n |\n| ![Democratic Republic of the Congo](image) Democratic Republic of Congo | 52,449\n |\n| ![Spain](image) Spain | 45,828\n |\n| ![Sri Lanka](image) Sri Lanka | 45,786\n |\n| ![Cameroon](image) Cameroon | 45,370\n |\n| ![Republic of the Congo](image) Republic of the Congo | 38,651\n |\n| ![Haiti](image) Haiti | 36,685\n |\n| ![Poland](image) Poland | 35,871\n |\n| ![Vietnam](image) Vietnam | 35,251\n |\n| ![Cambodia](image) Cambodia | 30,321\n |\n| ![](image) R\u00e9union | 30,077\n |\n| ![India](image) India | 29,623\n |\n| ![Serbia](image) Serbia | 25,632\n |\n| ![Lebanon](image) Lebanon | 21,066\n |\n| ![Madagascar](image) Madagascar | 21,002\n |\n| ![Germany](image) Germany | 20,523\n |\n| ![Pakistan](image) Pakistan | 20,178\n |\n| ![Russia](image) Russia | 19,019\n |\n| ![Mauritius](image) Mauritius | 18,840\n |\n| ![Guinea](image) Guinea | 18,709\n |\n| ![Brazil](image) Brazil | 17,887\n |\n| ![United Kingdom](image) United Kingdom | 17,789\n |\n| ![United States](image) United States | 17,583\n |\n| ![United Nations](image) Other countries and territories | 857,720\n |\n\n\nBy law, French censuses do not ask questions regarding ethnicity or religion, but do gather information concerning one's country of birth. From this it is still possible to determine that Paris and its metropolitan area is one of the most multi-cultural in Europe: According to the 2011 census, 456,105 residents of the municipality of Paris, or 20.3 percent, and 2,117,901 residents of the Paris Region (\u00cele-de-France), or 17.9 percent, were born outside France.[14] At the 1999 census, 4.2% of the population in Paris metropolitan area were recent immigrants (people who had immigrated to France between 1990 and 1999), the majority from Asia and Africa. 37 per cent of all immigrants in France live in the Paris region.[15]\n\n\nThe first wave of international migration to Paris started as early as 1820 with the arrivals of German peasants fleeing an agricultural crisis in their homeland. Several waves of immigration followed continually until today: Italians and central European Jews during the 19th century; Russians after the revolution of 1917 and Armenians fleeing genocide in the Ottoman Empire;[16] colonial subjects during World War I and later;[17] Poles between the two world wars; Spaniards, Italians, Portuguese, and North Africans from the 1950s to the 1970s; North African Jews after the independence of those countries; Africans and Asians since then.[18]\n\n\nThe Paris metropolitan region or \"aire urbaine\" is estimated to be home to some 1.7\u00a0million Muslims, making up between 10\u201315 per cent of the area's population. However, without official data, the margin of error of these estimates is extremely high as it is based on one's country of birth (someone born in a Muslim country or born to a parent from a Muslim country is considered as a \"potential Muslim\").[19] According to the North American Jewish Data Bank, an estimated 310,000\u00a0Jews also live in Paris and the surrounding \u00cele-de-France region, an area with a population of 11.7\u00a0million inhabitants. Paris has historically been a magnet for immigrants, hosting one of the largest concentrations of immigrants in Europe today.[20]\n\n\n\n### Immigrants and their children in departments of \u00cele-de-France (Paris Region)\n\n[edit]\n\nAnch National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies, responsible for the production and analysis of official statistics in France, 20 per cent of people living in the city of Paris are immigrants and 41.3 per cent of people under 20 have at least one immigrant parent.[21] Among the young people under 18, 12.1 per cent are of Maghrebi origin, 9.9 per cent of Subsaharan African origin and 4.0 per cent of South European origin.[22] In 2020-2021, about 6 million people, or 49% of the population of Paris, are either immigrants (21%) or have at least one immigrant parent (28%), these figures do not include French people born in Overseas France and their direct descendants.[23]\n\n\n\n\n\n| D\u00e9partement\n | Immigrants\n | Children under 20 with at least one immigrant parent\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Number\n | % department\n | % \u00cele-de-France\n | Number\n | % department\n | % \u00cele-de-France\n |\n| Paris (75) | 436,576 | 20 | 22.4 | 162,635 | 41.3 | 15.4\n |\n| Seine-Saint-Denis (93) | 394,831 | 26.5 | 20.2 | 234,837 | 57.1 | 22.2\n |\n| Hauts-de-Seine (92) | 250,190 | 16.3 | 12.8 | 124,501 | 34 | 11.8\n |\n| Val-de-Marne (94) | 234,633 | 18.1 | 12 | 127,701 | 40 | 12.1\n |\n| Val-d'Oise (95) | 185,890 | 16.1 | 9.5 | 124,644 | 38.5 | 11.8\n |\n| Yvelines (78) | 161,869 | 11.6 | 8.3 | 98,755 | 26.4 | 9.3\n |\n| Essonne (91) | 150,980 | 12.6 | 7.7 | 94,003 | 29.6 | 8.9\n |\n| Seine-et-Marne (77) | 135,654 | 10.7 | 7 | 90,319 | 26 | 8.5\n |\n| \u00cele-de-France | 1,950,623 | 16.9 | 100 | 1,057,394 | 37.1 | 100\n |\n\n\n(source\u00a0: Insee, EAR 2006)\nReading: 436 576 immigrants live in Paris, representing 20% of Parisians and 22.4% of immigrants in \u00cele-de-France.\n162 635 children under 20 with at least one immigrant parent live in Paris, representing 41.3 per cent of the total of children under 20 in Paris and 15.4 per cent of the total of children under 20 with at least one immigrant parent in \u00cele-de-France.\n\n\n\n## Expatriates\n\n[edit]\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | This section **needs expansion**.

The Asian population of France increased despite the closure. In 1975 there were 20,000 Asians in \u00cele-de-France. In 1982 the region had 59,000. This increased to 108,000 in 1990.[27]\n\n\nIn France the \"Asians\" are defined as people originating from the East Asian cultural sphere. The term does not include people from the Indian subcontinent. The usage of \"Asians\" differs from that of Anglo-Saxon countries.[26]\n\n\n\n#### Geography of the Asian population\n\n[edit]\n\nFor the entire \u00cele-de-France region, there were a total of 108,511 persons who held or formerly held Cambodian, Chinese, Laotian, Taiwanese, and Vietnamese citizenships as of 1990. This included 64,361 current citizens of those countries and 44,150 former citizens who became naturalized as French citizens.[28]\n\n\nAs of 1990, there were a combined total of 31,773 persons who held or formerly held Cambodian, Chinese, Laotian, Taiwanese, and Vietnamese citizenships in the City of Paris. This included 21,655 current citizens of those countries and 10,118 former citizens who became naturalized as French citizens.[28]\n\n\nAs of 1990 fewer than 10,000 persons of East/Southeast Asian origin resided in six communes of Marne-la-Vall\u00e9e. 26% of the population of Lognes was Asian, and other percentages were 8% in Noisiel, 5-6% in Noisy-le-Grand, and 5-6% in Torcy. In 1982 there were 6,000 Asians in Marne-la-Vall\u00e9e, making up 3-4% of the area's population. In 1987 the number increased to 9,000.[29]\n\n\nAs of circa 1998 Ivry-sur-Seine and Vitry-sur-Seine had a combined Asian population of 3,600.[30]\n\n\nAs of circa 1998 there were about 6,000 East/Southeast Asians in and around Aulnay-sous-Bois, and there were 3,000 persons of East and Southeast Asian origin in Aulnay proper. Most of them were of Cambodian origin, including those with and without Cambodian citizenship. The commune also had an above-average number of persons of Laotian origin, including those with and without Laotian citizenship. Ethnicities included Khmer people, Lao people, and Overseas Chinese.[30]\n\n\n\n#### Cambodians\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of 1990, in the City of Paris there were 7,950 Cambodian citizens and 3,279 former Cambodian citizens who became naturalized as French. The combined total is 11,229.[28]\n\n\nThat year, in the \u00cele-de-France region there were 26,553 Cambodian citizens and 13,068 former Cambodian citizens naturalized as French. The combined total was 39,421.[28]\n\n\n\n#### Chinese\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Chinese community in Paris\n\nAs of 1990 the majority of Asians living in the Paris area are ethnic Chinese originating from several countries.[27] The largest group includes ethnic Chinese from Indochina, and a smaller group originates from Zhejiang.[31]\n\n\n\n#### Japanese\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Japanese community in Paris\n\nAs of 2013 the official number of Japanese residents in Paris was 16,277.[32]\n\n\n\n#### Laotians\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of 1990, in the City of Paris there were 2,185 Laotian citizens and 1,376 former Laotian citizens naturalized as French, making a combined total of 3,561.[28]\n\n\nAs of that year, in the \u00cele-de-France region there were 10,110 Laotian citizens and 8,177 former Laotian citizens, making a combined total of 18,287.[28]\n\n\n\n#### Vietnamese\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Vietnamese community in Paris\n\nIn periods before 1975 several Vietnamese arrived in Paris, including intellectuals, those who worked as civil servants in colonial times, and those who came to Paris to study and did not return home. Ethnic Vietnamese arriving after 1975 became a part of an ethnic network established by those that came before them. Many Vietnamese achieved proficiency in the medical, scientific, and computer science fields.[33]\n\n\nAs of 1990, in the City of Paris there were 3,802 Vietnamese citizens and 4,155 former Vietnamese citizens naturalized as French, making a total of 7,957.[28]\n\n\nAs of that year, in the \u00cele-de-France region there were 16,387 Vietnamese citizens and 20,261 former Vietnamese citizens naturalized as French, making a total of 36,648.[28]\n\n\n\n## Historical population\n\n[edit]\n\n**Population density of Paris**\n\n* ![1807](image)\n\n1807\n* ![1817](image)\n\n1817\n* ![1831](image)\n\n1831\n* ![1836](image)\n\n1836\n* ![1841](image)\n\n1841\n* ![1846](image)\n\n1846\n* ![1851](image)\n\n1851\n* ![1856](image)\n\n1856\n* ![1861](image)\n\n1861\n* ![1866](image)\n\n1866\n* ![1872](image)\n\n1872\n* ![1876](image)\n\n1876\n* ![1881](image)\n\n1881\n* ![1886](image)\n\n1886\n* ![1891](image)\n\n1891\n* ![1896](image)\n\n1896\n* ![1901](image)\n\n1901\n* ![1906](image)\n\n1906\n* ![1911](image)\n\n1911\n* ![1921](image)\n\n1921\n* ![1926](image)\n\n1926\n* ![1931](image)\n\n1931\n* ![1936](image)\n\n1936\n* ![1946](image)\n\n1946\n* ![1954](image)\n\n1954\n* ![1962](image)\n\n1962\n* ![1968](image)\n\n1968\n* ![1975](image)\n\n1975\n* ![1982](image)\n\n1982\n* ![1990](image)\n\n1990\n* ![1999](image)\n\n1999\n* ![2007](image)\n\n2007\n* ![2012](image)\n\n2012\n* ![2017](image)\n\n2017\n\n\n![](image)Population of Paris from Julius Caesar to the French Revolution.\n![](image)City proper, urban area, and metropolitan area population from 1801 to 2010.\nNotes for the table:\n\n\n\n* until the 1830s, urbanization was contained within the administrative borders of the City of Paris; urban area figures before 1835 are thus the same as the city proper figures\n* the phenomenon of long commutes did not appear until the 1960s; metropolitan area figures before 1968 are thus essentially the same as the urban area figures\n* time comparisons should be exercised with care, as statistical borders vary year after year. E.g., the metropolitan area figure for 1968 is within the 1968 borders of the metropolitan area, whereas the metropolitan area figure for 1975 is within the 1975 expanded borders of the metropolitan area.\n\n\n\n\nHistorical Population\n|  | **City\u00a0proper** | **Urban\u00a0area** | **Metropolitan\u00a0area** | **Comments** |\n| **59\u00a0BC** | 25,000\n |  |  | Gallic population of the city at the start of the Roman conquest of Gaul. |\n| **150\u00a0AD** | 80,000\n |  |  | Peak of Roman era. |\n| **510** | 30,000\n |  |  |  |\n| **700s** | 20,000 \u2013 30,000[34][35] |  |  | Losses after invasions of 3rd and 4th centuries. |\n| **1000** | 20,000\n |  |  | Lowest point after Viking invasions. |\n| **1200** | 110,000\n |  |  | Recovery of the High Middle Ages. |\n| **1250** | 160,000[36] |  |  | Blossoming of the 13th century, golden age of King Saint Louis. |\n| **1300** | 228,000[36] |  |  |  |\n| **1328** | 250,000\n |  |  |  |\n| **1340** | 300,000[37] |  |  |  |\n| **1400** | 280,000[36] |  |  | Losses of the Black Plague. |\n| **1500** | 200,000\n |  |  | Losses of the Hundred Years' War. |\n| **1550** | 275,000\n |  |  | Renaissance recovery. |\n| **1594** | 210,000\n |  |  | Losses of religious and civil wars. |\n| **1634** | 420,000\n |  |  | Spectacular recovery under King Henry IV and Richelieu. |\n| **1700** | 515,000\n |  |  |  |\n| **1750** | 565,000\n |  |  |  |\n| **1789** | 630,000\n |  |  | Peak of prosperous 18th century. |\n|  | **City\u00a0proper** | **Urban\u00a0area** | **Metropolitan\u00a0area** | **Comments** |\n| **1801** | 546,856\n |  |  | Losses of French Revolution and wars. |\n| **1811** | 622,636\n |  |  |  |\n| **1817** | 713,966\n |  |  |  |\n| **1831** | 785,862\n |  |  |  |\n| **1835** |  | 1,000,000\n |  |  |\n| **1836** | 899,313\n |  |  |  |\n| **1841** | 935,261\n |  |  |  |\n| **1846** | 1,053,897\n |  |  |  |\n| **1851** | 1,053,262\n |  |  |  |\n| **1856** | 1,174,346\n |  |  |  |\n| **1861** | 1,696,141\n |  |  | New city limits; population in 1856 in the new city limits was 1,538,613. |\n| **1863** |  | 2,000,000\n |  | Fastest historical growth under Emperor Napoleon III and Haussmann. |\n| **1866** | 1,825,274\n |  |  |  |\n| **1872** | 1,851,792\n |  |  | Temporary stagnation due to the losses of the Siege of Paris during the Franco-Prussian War and the civil war of the Paris Commune and the Third Republic's brutal retribution towards the city. |\n| **1876** | 1,988,806\n |  |  |  |\n| **1881** | 2,269,023\n |  |  |  |\n| **1885** |  | 3,000,000\n |  |  |\n| **1886** | 2,344,550\n |  |  |  |\n| **1891** | 2,447,957\n |  |  |  |\n| **1896** | 2,536,834\n |  |  |  |\n|  | **City\u00a0proper** | **Urban\u00a0area** | **Metropolitan\u00a0area** | **Comments** |\n| **1901** | 2,714,068\n |  |  |  |\n| **1905** |  | 4,000,000\n |  |  |\n| **1906** | 2,763,393\n |  |  |  |\n| **1911** | 2,888,110\n | 4,500,000\n |  |  |\n| **1921** | 2,906,472\n | 4,850,000\n |  | Temporary stagnation due to losses of First World War. |\n| **1926** | 2,871,429\n | 5,160,008\n |  |  |\n| **1931** | 2,891,020\n | 5,674,419\n |  |  |\n| **1936** | 2,829,753\n | 5,784,072\n |  |  |\n| **1946** | 2,725,374\n | 5,600,000\n |  | Losses of Second World War. |\n| **1954** | 2,850,189\n | 6,436,296\n |  |  |\n| **1962** | 2,790,091\n | 7,384,363\n |  | Fastest population growth in the 20th century. |\n| **1968** | 2,590,771\n | 8,196,746\n | 8,368,000\n | End of postwar baby boom, end of immigration surplus for Paris; henceforth migration flows from the rest of France become negative, population growth is significantly slower. |\n| **1975** | 2,299,830\n | 8,549,898\n | 9,096,000\n |\n| **1982** | 2,176,243\n | 8,706,963\n | 9,362,000\n |  |\n| **1990** | 2,152,423[4] | 9,554,192[38] | 11,031,290[10] |  |\n| **1999** | 2,125,246[4] | 9,738,809[38] | 11,356,877[10] |  |\n| **2007** | 2,193,030[4] | 10,303,282[38] | 12,026,677[10] |  |\n| **2017** | 2,187,526[4] | 10,784,830[38] | 12,628,266[10] |  |\n| Sources:* City proper figures from 1801 on, urban area figures from 1954 on, and metropolitan area figures from 1990 on are official census figures.\n* City proper figures before 1801 and urban area figures before 1954 are estimates from various sources.\n* Metropolitan area figures before 1990 were reconstructed by Ph.
