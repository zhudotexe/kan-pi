The New York region continues to be by far the leading metropolitan gateway for legal immigrants admitted into the United States.[2][3][4][5] The city is the geographical and demographic center of both the Northeast megalopolis and the New York metropolitan area, the largest metropolitan area in the U.S. by both population and urban area. With over 20.1 million people in its metropolitan statistical area and 23.5 million in its combined statistical area as of 2020, New York City is one of the world's most populous megacities.[6]\n\n\nThe city and its metropolitan area are the premier gateway for legal immigration to the United States. New York City enforces a right-to-shelter law guaranteeing shelter to anyone who needs shelter, regardless of their immigration status;[7] and the city is home to more than 3.2 million residents born outside the U.S., the largest foreign-born population of any city in the world as of 2016.[8]\n\n\nThroughout its history, New York City has been a major point of entry for immigrants; the term \"melting pot\" was coined to describe densely populated immigrant neighborhoods on the Lower East Side. As many as 800 languages are spoken in New York,[9][10][11][12] making it the most linguistically diverse city in the world.[11][13][14] English remains the most widely spoken language, although there are areas in the outer boroughs in which up to 25% of people speak English as an alternate language, and/or have limited or no English language fluency. English is least spoken in neighborhoods such as Flushing, Sunset Park, and Corona.\n\n\nNew York's two key demographic features are its density and diversity. The city has an extremely high population density of 26,403 people per square mile (10,194/km2), about 10,000 more people per square mile than the next densest large American city, San Francisco.[15] Manhattan's population density is 66,940 people per square mile (25,846/km2).[16] The city has a long tradition of attracting international immigration and Americans seeking careers in certain sectors. As of 2006, New York City has ranked number one for seven consecutive years as the city most U.S. residents would most like to live in or near.[17]\n\n\n\n\n## Demographic profile[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Demographic history of New York City\n\n![](image)Population growth (blue) and population loss (red) from 1990 to 2000.

Beginning with 1900, figures are for consolidated city of five boroughs. For the same area before 1900, see #Historical population data, below. **Sources:** 1698\u20131771,[18] 1790\u20131990,[19] 2000 and 2010 Censuses,[20] 2020 Census,[21] and 2022 estimate[22] |\n\n\nNew York City is the most populous city in the United States, with an estimated 8,804,190 people living in the city, according to the 2020 U.S. Census[21] (up from 8,175,133 in 2010; 8.0 million in 2000; and 7.3 million in 1990).[20] This amounts to about 44% of New York State's population and a similar percentage of the metropolitan regional population. New York's two key demographic features are its population density and cultural diversity. The city's population density of 29,091.3 people per square mile (11,232/km2), makes it the densest of any American municipality with a population above 100,000.[23] Manhattan's population density is 74,781 people per square mile (28,872/km2), highest of any county in the United States.[24][16]\n\n\nNew York City is multicultural. About 36% of the city's population is foreign-born,[25] one of the highest among US cities. The eleven nations constituting the largest sources of modern immigration to New York City are the Dominican Republic, China, Jamaica, Guyana, Mexico, Ecuador, Brazil, Haiti, Trinidad and Tobago, Colombia, Russia and El Salvador.[26]\n\n\nNew York is the largest city in the United States, with the city proper's population more than double the next largest city, Los Angeles (or roughly equivalent to the combined populations of Los Angeles, Chicago, and Houston, the United States' second, third, and fourth most populous cities respectively). In 2006, demographers estimated New York's population would reach 9.1 million by 2030.[27]\nIn 2000 the reported life expectancy of New Yorkers was above the national average. Life expectancy for females born in 2009 in New York City is 80.2 years and for males is 74.5 years.[28]\n\n\n\n### Households[edit]\n\n\nThe 2000 census counted 2,021,588 households with a median income of $38,293. 30% of households had children under the age of 18, and 37% were married couples living together. 19% had a single female householder, and 39% were non-families. 32% of all households were made up of individuals, and 10% were single residents 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.59 persons, and the average family size was 3.32.\n\n\n\n\n\n% population by age range\n| **Age range** | 2000 Census\n |\n| Under the age of 18\n | 24%\n |\n| Between 18 and 24\n | 10%\n |\n| Between 25 and 44\n | 33%\n |\n| Between 45 and 64\n | 21%\n |\n| Aged 65 or older\n | 12%\n |\n\n\nThe median age in New York City in 2000 was 34 years. For every 100 females, there were 90 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 86 males.\n\n\nDuring the 2000s, Manhattan experienced a \"baby boom\" unique among U.S. cities. Between 2000 and 2007, the number of children under age 5 living in Manhattan grew by more than 32%.[29] The increase is driven mostly by affluent white families with median household incomes over $300,000.\n\n\n\n### Income[edit]\n\n\nOverall, nominal household income in New York City is characterized by large variations. This phenomenon is especially true of Manhattan, which in 2005 was home to the highest incomes U.S. census tract, with a household income of $188,697, as well as the lowest, where household income was $9,320.[30] The disparity is driven in part by wage growth in high income brackets. In 2006 the average weekly wage in Manhattan was $1,453, the highest among the largest counties in the United States.[31] Wages in Manhattan were the fastest growing among the nation's 10 largest counties.[31] Among young adults in New York who work full-time, women now earn more money than men \u2014 approximately $5,000 more in 2005.[32]\n\n\nNew York City's borough of Manhattan is the highest nominal income county in the United States. In particular, ZIP code 10021 on Manhattan's Upper East Side, with more than 100,000 inhabitants and a per capita income of over $90,000, has one of the largest concentrations of income in the United States. The other boroughs, especially Queens and Staten Island, have large middle-class populations. New York City's per capita income in 2000 was $22,402; men and women had a median income of $37,435 and $32,949 respectively. 21.2% of the population and 18.5% of families had incomes below the federal poverty line; 30.0% of this group were under the age of 18 and 17.8% were 65 and older. Of Forbes Magazine's 400 richest American billionaires, 70 live in New York City.[33] Former mayor and Presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg is one of the nation's richest men. As of 2009 New York has regained the number one spot as the city with most billionaires (55), after losing out to Moscow in 2008.\n\n\nNew York City has a high degree of income variation. In 2005 the median household income in the highest census tract was reported to be $188,697, while in the lowest it was $9,320.[34] The variance is driven by wage growth in high income brackets, while wages have stagnated for middle and lower income brackets. In 2006 the average weekly wage in Manhattan was $1,453, the highest and fastest growing among the largest counties in the United States.[31] The borough is also experiencing a \"baby boom\" among the wealthy that is unique among U.S. cities. Since 2000, the number of children under age 5 living in Manhattan has grown by more than 32%.[35]\n\n\nIn 2000, about 3 out of every 10 New York City housing units were owner-occupied, compared to about 2 owner-occupied units out of every 3 units in the U.S. as a whole.[36] Rental vacancy is usually between 3% and 4.5%, well below the 5% threshold defined to be a housing emergency, justifying the continuation of rent control and rent stabilization. About 33% of rental units fall under rent stabilization, according to which increases are adjudicated periodically by city agencies. Rent control covers only a very small number of rental units.[37] Some critics point to New York City's strict zoning and other regulations as partial causes for the housing shortage, but during the city's decline in population from the 1960s through the 1980s, a large number of apartment buildings suffered suspected arson fires or were abandoned by their owners. Once the population trend was reversed, with rising prospects for rentals and sales, new construction has resumed, but generally for purchasers in higher income brackets.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Area\n | MedianHouse-holdIncome | MeanHouse-holdIncome | Percent-age in Poverty\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| The Bronx | $34,156\n | $46,298\n | 27.1%\n |\n| Brooklyn | $41,406\n | $60,020\n | 21.9%\n |\n| Manhattan | $64,217\n | $121,549\n | 17.6%\n |\n| Queens | $53,171\n | $67,027\n | 12.0%\n |\n| Staten Island | $66,985\n | $81,498\n | 9.8%\n |\n| New York City | $48,631\n | $75,809\n | 18.5%\n |\n| New York State | $53,514\n | $77,865\n | 13.7%\n |\n| United States | $50,140\n | $69,193\n | 13.0%\n |\n\n\n### Boroughs[edit]\n\n\nThis section is an excerpt from Boroughs of New York City.[edit]\n![](image)1. Manhattan (New York County)\n 2. Brooklyn (Kings County)\n 3. Queens (Queens County)\n 4. The Bronx (Bronx County)\n 5. Staten Island (Richmond County)\n Note: JFK and LGA airports are both located in Queens (marked by brown).\nThe Boroughs of New York City are the five major governmental districts that compose New York City. The boroughs are the Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, and Staten Island. Each borough is coextensive with a respective county of the State of New York: The Bronx is Bronx County, Brooklyn is Kings County, Manhattan is New York County, Queens is Queens County, and Staten Island is Richmond County.\n\n\nAll five boroughs came into existence with the creation of modern New York City in 1898, when New York County (then including the Bronx), Kings County, Richmond County, and part of Queens County were consolidated within one municipal government under a new city charter. All former municipalities within the newly consolidated city were dissolved.\n\n\nNew York City was originally confined to Manhattan Island and the smaller surrounding islands that formed New York County. As the city grew northward, it began annexing areas on the mainland, absorbing territory from Westchester County into New York County in 1874 (West Bronx) and 1895 (East Bronx). During the 1898 consolidation, this territory was organized as the Borough of the Bronx, though still part of New York County. In 1914, Bronx County was split off from New York County so that each borough was then coterminous with a county.\n\n\n\nWhen the western part of Queens County was consolidated with New York City in 1898, that area became the Borough of Queens. In 1899, the remaining eastern section of Queens County was split off to form Nassau County on Long Island, thereafter making the borough and county of Queens coextensive with each other.\n\n\n\n| New York City's five boroughs* v\n* t\n* e\n |\n| --- |\n| Jurisdiction\n | Population\n | Land area\n | Density of population\n | GDP |\n| Borough | County | Census (2020) | square miles | squarekm | people/sq. mile | people/sq. km | billions(2022 US$) 2 |\n| **The Bronx**\n | Bronx\n | 1,472,654\n | 42.2\n | 109.2\n | 34,920\n | 13,482\n | $43.7\n |\n| **Brooklyn**\n | Kings\n | 2,736,074\n | 69.4\n | 179.7\n | 39,438\n | 15,227\n | $107.3\n |\n| **Manhattan**\n | New York\n | 1,694,251\n | 22.7\n | 58.7\n | 74,781\n | 28,872\n | $781.0\n |\n| **Queens**\n | Queens\n | 2,405,464\n | 108.7\n | 281.6\n | 22,125\n | 8,542\n | $103.3\n |\n| **Staten Island**\n | Richmond\n | 495,747\n | 57.5\n | 149.0\n | 8,618\n | 3,327\n | $17.5\n |\n| **City of New York**\n | **8,804,190** | **300.5** | **778.2** | **29,303** | **11,314** | **$1,052.8** |\n| State of New York\n | 20,201,249 | 47,123.6 | 122,049.5 | 429 | 166 | $1,763.5\n |\n| **Sources**:[38][39][40][41] and see individual borough articles.\n |\n\n\n### Projections[edit]\n\n\n**Neighborhood Tabulation Areas** (**NTA**s) are a geographic unit created to help project populations at a small area level, as part of the long-term sustainability plan for the city known as **PlaNYC**, covering the years 2000\u20132030. The minimum population for an NTA is 15,000 people, a level seen as a useful summary level which can be used both with the 2010 Census and the American Community Survey.[42]\n\n\nNew York has ranked first in population among American cities since the first census in 1790. New York will maintain this position for the foreseeable future, although there are varying forecasts on how much the population will increase. The most realistic population projections from the Department of City Planning anticipate a 1.1 million increase by 2030, bringing the city's population total to 9.1 million.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nWhile the city's projected 2030 population will be a new high, only two boroughs, Staten Island and Queens have reached their population peak every year for the last 5 years. The study projects that by 2030, Queens will have 2.57 million people and Staten Island 552,000. Manhattan, with 1.83 million, Bronx with 1.46 million and Brooklyn with 2.72 million, will still be below their population peaks.[43]\n\n\n\n#### Disputed 2010 Census data[edit]\n\n\nOn March 27, 2011, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced that the city would file a formal challenge to the Census results, as a result of alleged undercounting in the boroughs of Queens and Brooklyn.[44] The mayor has asserted that the numbers for Queens and Brooklyn, the two most populous boroughs, are implausible.[45] According to the Census, they grew by only 0.1% and 1.6%, respectively, while the other boroughs grew by between 3% and 5%. In addition, the Mayor claims, the census showed improbably high amounts of vacant housing in vital neighborhoods such as Jackson Heights, Queens.\n\n\n\n### Race and ethnicity[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Race and ethnicity in New York City and New York City ethnic enclaves\n\n![](image)Map of racial distribution in New York, 2010 U.S. Census. Each dot is 25 people: **White**, **Black**, **Asian**, **Hispanic**, or **Other** (yellow)\n![](image)Chinatown, Manhattan, is the highest concentration of Chinese people in the Western Hemisphere.[46]\n![](image)Brooklyn's Jewish community is the largest in the United States, with approximately 600,000 individuals.[47]\nThe city's population in 2020 was 30.9% White (non-Hispanic), 28.7% Hispanic or Latino, 20.2% Black or African American (non-Hispanic), 15.6% Asian, and 0.2% Native American (non-Hispanic). A total of 3.4% of the non-Hispanic population identified with more than one race.[48]\n\n\nIn 2013, approximately 36% of the city's population is foreign born,[49] and more than half of all children are born to mothers who are immigrants. Throughout its history, New York has been a major port of entry for immigrants into the United States.[50][25] In New York, no single country or region of origin dominates.[50] The ten largest sources of foreign-born individuals in the city as of 2011[update] were the Dominican Republic, China, Mexico, Guyana, Jamaica, Ecuador, Haiti, India, Russia, and Trinidad and Tobago,[51] Queens has the largest Asian American and Andean populations in the United States, and is also the most ethnically and linguistically diverse urban area in the world.[52][53]\n\n\nThe metropolitan area is home to 20% of the nation's Indian Americans and at least 20 Little India enclaves, and 15% of all Korean Americans and four Koreatowns;[54] the largest Asian Indian population in the Western Hemisphere; the largest Russian American,[55] Italian American, and African American populations; the largest Dominican American, Puerto Rican American, and South American[55] and second-largest overall Hispanic population in the United States, numbering 4.8\u00a0million;[56] and includes multiple established Chinatowns within New York City alone.[57]\n\n\nNew York City has the largest European and non-Hispanic white population of any American city, with 2.7\u00a0million in 2012.[58] The European diaspora residing in the city is very diverse and many European ethnic groups have formed enclaves in New York.[59][60][61] More than 12 million European immigrants were received at Ellis Island between 1892 and 1954.[62]\n\n\nAsian Americans in New York City, according to the 2010 census, number more than one million, greater than the combined totals of San Francisco and Los Angeles.[63] New York contains the highest total Asian population of any U.S. city proper.[64] The Manhattan's Chinatown is the highest concentration of Chinese people in the Western Hemisphere,[46] while Queens is home to the largest Tibetan population outside Asia.[65] Arab Americans number over 160,000 in New York City,[66] with the highest concentration in Brooklyn. Central Asians, primarily Uzbek Americans, are a rapidly growing segment of the city's non-Hispanic White population.[67]\n\n\nNew York is also home to the highest Jewish population of any city in the world, numbering 1.6 million in 2022, more than Tel Aviv and Jerusalem combined.[68] In the borough of Brooklyn, an estimated 1 in 4 residents is Jewish.[69]\n\n\nVenezuela, Ecuador, Colombia, Guyana, Peru, and Brazil, are the top source countries from South America for immigrants to the New York City region; the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, Haiti, and Trinidad and Tobago in the Caribbean; Nigeria, Egypt, Ghana, Tanzania, Kenya, and South Africa from Africa; and El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala in Central America.[70] Amidst a resurgence of Puerto Rican migration to New York City, this population had increased to approximately 1.5\u00a0million in the metropolitan area as of 2016[update].[71]\n\n\nSince 2010, Little Australia has emerged and is growing rapidly, representing the Australasian presence in Nolita, Manhattan.[72][73][74][75] In 2011, there were an estimated 20,000 Australian residents of New York City, nearly quadruple the 5,537 in 2005.[76][77] Qantas Airways of Australia and Air New Zealand have been planning for long-haul flights from New York to Sydney and Auckland, which would both rank among the longest non-stop flights in the world.[78]\n\n\nThroughout its history New York City has been a principal entry point for immigration to the United States. These immigrants often form ethnic enclaves, neighborhoods dominated by one ethnicity. The city experienced major immigration from Europe in the 19th century and another major wave in the early 20th century, being admitted into the United States of America primarily through Ellis Island. Since the passage of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, and particularly since the 1980s, New York City has seen renewed rates of high immigration. Newer immigrants are from Latin America, the Caribbean, Asia, Eastern Europe and Africa. 36% of the city's population is foreign-born.[25] Among U.S. cities, this proportion is higher only in Los Angeles and Miami.[16] In New York no single country or region of origin dominates. The eleven largest countries of origin are the Dominican Republic, China, Jamaica, Guyana, Mexico, Ecuador, Haiti, Trinidad and Tobago, Colombia, Russia and El Salvador.[79] Between 1990 and 2000 the city admitted 1,224,524 immigrants.[80] Demographers and city officials have observed that immigration to New York City has been slowing since 1997. This is mostly due to more and more immigrants choosing directly to locate to the city's suburbs and then commute to the city or work in many of its booming edge cities such as Fort Lee, NJ, Hempstead, NY, Morristown, NJ, Stamford, CT, White Plains, NY and others. Despite the slowdown in immigration the city's overall immigrant population has continued to increase and in 2006 it numbered 3.038 million (37.0%) up from 2.871 million (35.9%) in 2000.[81][82] By 2013, the population of foreign-born individuals living in New York City had increased to 3.07 million, and as a percentage of total population, was the highest it had been in the past 100 years.[83]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\n| Religious affiliation (2014)[84][85] |\n| --- |\n|  |  |  |\n| Christian |  | 59% |\n| Catholic |  | 33% |\n| Protestant |  | 23% |\n| Other Christian |  | 3% |\n| Unaffiliated |  | 24% |\n| Jewish |  | 8% |\n| Muslim |  | 4% |\n| Hindu |  | 2% |\n| Buddhist |  | 1% |\n| Other faiths |  | 1% |\n\nReligious affiliations in New York City\n![](image)\nThe landmark Neo-Gothic Roman Catholic St. Patrick's Cathedral, Midtown Manhattan\n![](image)\nCentral Synagogue, a notable Reform synagogue located at 652 Lexington Avenue\n![](image)\nThe Islamic Cultural Center of New York in Upper Manhattan, the first mosque built in New York City\n![](image)\nGanesh Temple in Flushing, Queens, the oldest Hindu temple in the U.S.\n\n#### Christianity[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: St. Patrick's Cathedral (Midtown Manhattan), Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree, and Christmas in New York\n\nLargely as a result of Western European missionary work and colonialism, Christianity is the largest religion (59% adherent) in New York City,[84] which is home to the highest number of churches of any city in the world.[86] Roman Catholicism is the largest Christian denomination (33%), followed by Protestantism (23%), and other Christian denominations (3%). The Roman Catholic population are primarily served by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York and Diocese of Brooklyn. Eastern Catholics are divided into numerous jurisdictions throughout the city. Evangelical Protestantism is the largest branch of Protestantism in the city (9%), followed by Mainline Protestantism (8%), while the converse is usually true for other cities and metropolitan areas.[85] In Evangelicalism, Baptists are the largest group; in Mainline Protestantism, Reformed Protestants compose the largest subset. The majority of historically African American churches are affiliated with the National Baptist Convention (USA) and Progressive National Baptist Convention. The Church of God in Christ is one of the largest predominantly Black Pentecostal denominations in the area. Approximately 1% of the population is Mormon. The Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America and other Orthodox Christians (mainstream and independent) were the largest Eastern Christian groups. The American Orthodox Catholic Church (initially led by Aftimios Ofiesh) was founded in New York City in 1927.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n#### Judaism[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Judaism in New York City, History of the Jews in New York, and Jewish arrival in New Amsterdam\n\nJudaism, the second-largest religion practiced in New York City, with approximately 1.6\u00a0million adherents as of 2022, represents the largest Jewish community of any city in the world, greater than the combined totals of Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.[87][88] Nearly half of the city's Jews live in Brooklyn, which is one-quarter Jewish.[89][90] The ethno-religious population makes up 18.4% of the city and its religious demographic makes up 8%.[91] The first recorded Jewish settler was Jacob Barsimson, who arrived in August 1654 on a passport from the Dutch West India Company[*importance?*].[92] Following the assassination of Alexander II of Russia, for which many blamed \"the Jews\", the 36 years beginning in 1881 experienced the largest wave of Jewish immigration to the United States.[93][*relevant?*] In 2012, the largest Jewish denominations were Orthodox, Haredi, and Conservative Judaism.[94] Reform Jewish communities are prevalent through the area. 770 Eastern Parkway is the headquarters of the international Chabad Lubavitch movement, and is considered an icon, while Congregation Emanu-El of New York in Manhattan is the largest Reform synagogue in the world.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n#### Islam[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Islam in New York City\n\nIslam ranks as the third largest religion in New York City, following Christianity and Judaism, with estimates ranging between 600,000 and 1,000,000 observers of Islam, including 10% of the city's public school children.[95] 22.3% of American Muslims live in New York City, with 1.5 million Muslims in the greater New York metropolitan area, representing the largest metropolitan Muslim population in the Western Hemisphere[96]\u2014and the most ethnically diverse Muslim population of any city in the world.[97] Powers Street Mosque in Brooklyn is one of the oldest continuously operating mosques in the U.S., and represents the first Islamic organization in both the city and the state of New York.[98][99]\n\n\n\n#### Hinduism and other religious affiliations[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Hindu Temple Society of North America\n\nFollowing these three largest religious groups in New York City are Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Zoroastrianism, and a variety of other religions. As of 2023, 24% of Greater New Yorkers identified with no organized religious affiliation, including 4% Atheist.[100]\n\n\n\n### Wealth and income disparity[edit]\n\n\nNew York City, like other large cities, has a high degree of income disparity, as indicated by its Gini coefficient of 0.55 as of 2017.[101] In the first quarter of 2014,[*needs update*] the average weekly wage in New York County (Manhattan) was $2,749, representing the highest total among large counties in the United States.[102] In 2022, New York City was home to the highest number of billionaires of any city in the world, with a total of 107.[103] New York also had the highest density of millionaires per capita among major U.S. cities in 2014, at 4.6% of residents.[104] New York City is one of the relatively few American cities levying an income tax (about 3%) on its residents.[105][106][107] As of 2018, there were 78,676 homeless people in New York City.[108]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Demographics of the Bronx\n* Demographics of Brooklyn\n* Demographics of Manhattan\n* Demographics of Queens\n* Demographics of Staten Island\n* Undocumented immigrants in New York City\n* New York City ethnic enclaves\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Ian Gordon; Tony Travers; Christine Whitehead; London School of Economics; Political Science (July 2007). \"The Impact of Recent Immigration on the London Economy\" (PDF).
