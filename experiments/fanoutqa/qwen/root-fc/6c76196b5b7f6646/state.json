Figures are given in United States dollars (USD). Many films that were released during the 20th century do not appear on this list as figures have not been adjusted for inflation, and as a result the films on this list have all had a theatrical run (including re-releases) since 2004. Films that have not played since then do not appear on the chart due to ticket price inflation, population size, and ticket purchasing trends not being considered. If inflation were adjusted for, *Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs* would appear at the top of the chart with an adjusted gross of $1,977,000,000.[2][nb 1] All except two\u2014*The Simpsons Movie* and the original 1994 version of *The Lion King*\u2014are computer-animated films. *Despicable Me* is the most represented franchise with all five films in the top 50 highest-grossing animated films. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe following chart is a list of the highest-grossing animated film franchises. The top three are among the highest-grossing film franchises of all time and, respectively, are ranked 15th, 17th, and 20th of all time. Pixar is the most represented studio with five franchises on this list. *Despicable Me* is the highest-grossing animated franchise of all time with $4.6\u00a0billion; it is also one of three animated franchises (*Toy Story* and *Frozen*) with two films grossing over $1\u00a0billion worldwide. *Frozen* is the only animated franchise where every installment grossed $1\u00a0billion; it has the highest per-film average, with nearly $1.4\u00a0billion unadjusted. A given franchise needs to have at least two theatrically released films to qualify for this list.\n\n\n\n\u2020\u00a0*Background shading indicates that at least one film in the series is playing in the week commencing 7 June 2024 in theaters around the world*.\n\n\n\n**Highest-grossing animated franchises and film series**[\u00a7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | $100,000,000 | [# 4][# 5] |\n\n\n* ( ... ) Since grosses are not limited to original theatrical runs, a film's first-run gross is included in brackets after the total if known.\n* \\*U.S. and Canada gross only\n* ITItaly only\n* ESSpanish only\n* SWSwedish gross only\n* NWNorwegian gross only\n* AUAustralian gross only\n* JPJapanese gross only\n* RDistributor rental\n* TBDTo be determined\n* N/ANot applicable; no animated feature length film was released in that year.\n* HFilms contain animated/live-action scenes.\n\n\n## Timeline of highest-grossing animated films[edit]\n\n\nAt least eight animated films have held the record of highest-grossing animated film at different times.
