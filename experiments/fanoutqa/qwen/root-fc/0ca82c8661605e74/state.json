Ramsay, T. Cleve, and N. Langlet | P. Janssen and Lockyer observed independently a yellow line in the solar spectrum that did not match any other element. However, only Lockyer made the correct conclusion that it was due to a new element. This was the first observation of a noble gas, located in the Sun. Years later after the isolation of argon on Earth, Ramsay, Cleve, and Langlet observed independently helium trapped in cleveite.[126] |\n|  |  | **1869** | **D. I.

Claus* | Gottfried Wilhelm Osann thought that he found three new metals in Russian platinum samples in 1826, which he named polinium, pluranium, and ruthenium in 1828. But his results were questioned and he did not have enough quantities to isolate them, so he withdrew his claims in 1829.[119] However, in 1844 Karl Karlovich Klaus confirmed that there was one new metal, and reused Osann's name \"ruthenium\".[120] |\n| 55\n | Caesium | 1860\n | R. Bunsen and R. Kirchhoff | 1882\n | C. Setterberg | Bunsen and Kirchhoff were the first to suggest finding new elements by spectrum analysis. They discovered caesium by its two blue emission lines in a sample of D\u00fcrkheim mineral water.[121] The pure metal was eventually isolated in 1882 by Setterberg.[122] |\n| 37\n | Rubidium | 1861\n | R. Bunsen and G. R. Kirchhoff | 1863\n | R. Bunsen\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | Bunsen and Kirchhoff discovered it just a few months after caesium, by observing new spectral lines in the mineral lepidolite.[123] The metal was isolated by Bunsen around 1863.[108] |\n| 81\n | Thallium | 1861\n | W. Crookes | 1862\n | C.-A. Lamy | Shortly after the discovery of rubidium, Crookes found a new green line in a selenium sample; later that year, Lamy found the element to be metallic.[124] |\n| 49\n | Indium | 1863\n | F. Reich and T. Richter | 1864\n | T.

Tennant and H.-V. Collet-Descotils | *1803* | *S.

It had been predicted by Mendeleev in 1871 as eka-manganese.[157][158][159] In 1952, Paul W. Merrill found its spectral lines in S-type red giants.[160] Minuscule trace quantities were finally found on Earth in 1962 by B. T. Kenna and Paul K. Kuroda: they isolated it from Belgian Congo pitchblende, where it occurs as a spontaneous fission product of uranium.[161] The Noddacks (rediscoverers of rhenium) claimed to have discovered element\u00a043 in 1925 as well and named it *masurium* (after Masuria), but their claims were disproven by Kuroda, who calculated that there cannot have been enough technetium in their samples to have enabled a true detection.[162] |\n| 87\n | Francium | 1939\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Z\n | Element\n | Observed or predicted\n | Isolated (widely\u00a0known) | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  | By |  | By |  |\n| 15\n | Phosphorus | 1669\n | H.

Carl Wilhelm Scheele, Henry Cavendish, and Joseph Priestley also studied the element at about the same time, and Lavoisier named it in 1775\u20136.[69] |\n| 56\n | Barium | 1772\n | W. Scheele\n | 1808\n | H. Davy\n | Scheele distinguished a new earth (BaO) in pyrolusite in 1772. He did not name his discovery; Guyton de Morveau suggested *barote* in 1782.[5] It was changed to *baryte* in the *M\u00e9thode de nomenclature chimique* of Louis-Bernard Guyton de Morveau, Antoine Lavoisier, Claude Louis Berthollet, and Antoine Fran\u00e7ois, comte de Fourcroy (1787). Davy isolated the metal by electrolysis.[70] |\n| 17\n | Chlorine | 1774\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFor 18th-century discoveries, around the time that Antoine Lavoisier first questioned the phlogiston theory, the recognition of a new \"earth\" has been regarded as being equivalent to the discovery of a new element (as was the general practice then).[5]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | Berzelius obtained the oxide of a new earth in thorite.[114] |\n| 57\n | Lanthanum | 1838\n | G.

Mosander | 1885\n | C. A. von Welsbach | Discovered by Mosander and called didymium. Carl Auer von Welsbach later split it into two elements, praseodymium and neodymium.

A longer-lived isotope 231Pa was found in 1918 by Otto Hahn and Lise Meitner, and was named by them protoactinium: since it is longer-lived, it gave the element its name. Protoactinium was changed to protactinium in 1949.[154] Originally isolated in 1900 by William Crookes, who nevertheless did not recognize that it was a new element.[155] |\n| 72\n | Hafnium | 1922\n | D.

Berzelius | Silicon compounds (rock crystals and glass) were known to the ancients, but its chemical investigation dates only to the 17th century. Becher (of the phlogiston theory) identified silica as the *terra vitrescibilis*, and Johann Heinrich Pott recognised it as an individual \"earth\" in his treatise of 1739.[5] Silica appears as a \"simple earth\" in the *M\u00e9thode de nomenclature chimique*, and in 1789 Lavoisier concluded that the element must exist.[5] Davy thought in 1800 that silica was a compound, not an element, and in 1808 he proved this although he could not isolate the element, and suggested the name *silicium*.[43][44] In 1811 Louis-Joseph Gay-Lussac and Louis-Jacques Th\u00e9nard probably prepared impure silicon,[45] and Berzelius obtained the pure element in 1823.[46] The name was proposed to be changed to *silicon* by Thomas Thomson in 1817, and this was eventually accepted because of its analogies to boron and carbon.\n |\n| 27\n | Cobalt | 1735\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | C.

A. von Welsbach* | von Welsbach proved that the old ytterbium also contained a new element, which he named *cassiopeium* (he renamed the larger part of the old ytterbium to *aldebaranium*). Urbain also proved this at about the same time (von Welsbach's paper was published first, but Urbain sent his to the editor first), naming the new element *lutetium* and the old one *neoytterbium* (which later reverted back to ytterbium). However, Urbain's samples were very impure and only contained trace quantities of the new element. Despite this, his chosen name *lutetium* was adopted by the International Committee of Atomic Weights, whose membership included Urbain. The German Atomic Weights Commission adopted *cassiopeium* for the next forty years. Finally in 1949 IUPAC decided in favour of the name *lutetium* as it was more often used.[72][149] |\n| 75\n | Rhenium | 1908\n | M. Ogawa | *1919* | M. Ogawa\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | G.
