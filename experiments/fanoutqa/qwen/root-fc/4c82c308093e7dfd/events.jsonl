In preparation for this expansion in mission, William Smith was hired in 1754 to become the new provost. Neither George Whitefield nor Benjamin Franklin formally held this title.\n2. **^** Benjamin Franklin is the founder of the institution which grew to become the University of Pennsylvania. Franklin first convened a board of trustees for an organizational meeting on November 13, 1749. They opened a secondary school, the Academy of Philadelphia, in 1751. A collegiate charter was obtained for the College of Philadelphia in 1755 and post-secondary instruction began shortly thereafter. It was the College of Philadelphia which ultimately was renamed the University of Pennsylvania in 1791. Penn considered 1749 to be its founding date until 1899, when the board of trustees voted to retroactively revise its founding date to 1740 in order to make the university older than Princeton University, which had been chartered in 1746. The 1740 date was selected because, in that year, a group of Philadelphians joined together to build a large preaching hall for the use of traveling evangelist George Whitefield who toured the American colonies delivering well attended open air sermons. The grand building was erected but, due to a shortage of funding, the interior was not furnished and the hall sat unused until Franklin's group purchased it in 1750. Thus, Whitefield himself was not involved in the school which eventually became Penn, but is listed here as a placeholder to signify the period that the preaching hall raised by his followers sat dormant between 1740 and 1750.\n3. **^** As described in more detail in the appended notes, a charity school was planned by followers of George Whitefield but it never opened before the building was purchased by Benjamin Franklin's group in 1750. The structure itself was known as the \"New Building\" but the associated educational trust itself was never named.\n4. **^** Franklin's formal title was president of the board of trustees, first of the \"Academy and Charitable School in the Province of Pennsylvania\" until the college was founded, and then of the \"College, Academy and Charity School of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania.\"\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nUniversity of Pennsylvania\n |\n| --- |\n| Schools | * Arts and Sciences\n\t+ College\n\t+ Graduate Division\n\t+ Liberal and Professional Studies\n* Communication\n* Dental Medicine\n* Design\n* Education\n* Engineering and Applied Science\n* Law\n* Medicine\n* Nursing\n* Social Policy and Practice\n* Veterinary Medicine\n* Wharton\n | ![Benjamin Franklin (University of Pennsylvania)](image)\n |\n| Programs | * Advanced Judaic Studies\n* Government\n* Global Communication Studies\n* Mediterranean Art and Archaeology\n* International Studies and Business\n* Management and Technology\n* Lauder Institute\n* Health Economics\n* Networked and Social Systems Engineering\n* Molecular Life Science\n* Public Policy\n* Diplomacy and Global Engagement\n |\n| Places | * University City\n* Annenberg Center\n* College Hall\n* College Houses\n* David Rittenhouse Laboratory\n* Fisher Fine Arts Library\n* Historic District\n* Houston Hall\n* Institute of Contemporary Art\n* Irvine Auditorium\n* Kelly Writers House\n* Meyerson Hall\n* Moore School\n* Morris Arboretum\n* Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology\n* New Bolton Center\n* Penn Park\n* Perelman Quadrangle\n* The Quadrangle\n* Richards Laboratories\n* Van Pelt Library\n |\n| Athletics | * Penn Quakers\n* Band\n* \"Fight on, Pennsylvania!\"\n* Basketball\n\t+ Men's\n\t+ Women's\n* Football\n* College Boat Club\n* Lacrosse\n* Penn Relays\n* Soccer\n\t+ Men's\n\t+ Women's\n* Men's squash\n* Class of 1923 Arena\n* Franklin Field\n* Meiklejohn Stadium\n* Palestra\n |\n| Media | * *The Daily Pennsylvanian*\n\t+ *34th Street Magazine*\n\t+ *Under the Button*\n* *Pennsylvania Punch Bowl*\n* Penn Press\n* Wharton School Publishing\n* WQHS\n* WXPN\n |\n| Life | * Student life\n* Penn Band\n* Mask and Wig\n* Glee Club\n* Masala\n* MERT\n* Philomathean Society\n* Penn Club of New York\n* \"Hail, Pennsylvania!\"\n* \"The Red and Blue\"\n |\n| People | * **President:** J.

In preparation for this expansion in mission, William Smith was hired in 1754 to become the new provost. Neither George Whitefield nor Benjamin Franklin formally held this title.\n2. **^** Benjamin Franklin is the founder of the institution which grew to become the University of Pennsylvania. Franklin first convened a board of trustees for an organizational meeting on November 13, 1749. They opened a secondary school, the Academy of Philadelphia, in 1751. A collegiate charter was obtained for the College of Philadelphia in 1755 and post-secondary instruction began shortly thereafter. It was the College of Philadelphia which ultimately was renamed the University of Pennsylvania in 1791. Penn considered 1749 to be its founding date until 1899, when the board of trustees voted to retroactively revise its founding date to 1740 in order to make the university older than Princeton University, which had been chartered in 1746. The 1740 date was selected because, in that year, a group of Philadelphians joined together to build a large preaching hall for the use of traveling evangelist George Whitefield who toured the American colonies delivering well attended open air sermons. The grand building was erected but, due to a shortage of funding, the interior was not furnished and the hall sat unused until Franklin's group purchased it in 1750. Thus, Whitefield himself was not involved in the school which eventually became Penn, but is listed here as a placeholder to signify the period that the preaching hall raised by his followers sat dormant between 1740 and 1750.\n3. **^** As described in more detail in the appended notes, a charity school was planned by followers of George Whitefield but it never opened before the building was purchased by Benjamin Franklin's group in 1750. The structure itself was known as the \"New Building\" but the associated educational trust itself was never named.\n4. **^** Franklin's formal title was president of the board of trustees, first of the \"Academy and Charitable School in the Province of Pennsylvania\" until the college was founded, and then of the \"College, Academy and Charity School of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania.\"\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nUniversity of Pennsylvania\n |\n| --- |\n| Schools | * Arts and Sciences\n\t+ College\n\t+ Graduate Division\n\t+ Liberal and Professional Studies\n* Communication\n* Dental Medicine\n* Design\n* Education\n* Engineering and Applied Science\n* Law\n* Medicine\n* Nursing\n* Social Policy and Practice\n* Veterinary Medicine\n* Wharton\n | ![Benjamin Franklin (University of Pennsylvania)](image)\n |\n| Programs | * Advanced Judaic Studies\n* Government\n* Global Communication Studies\n* Mediterranean Art and Archaeology\n* International Studies and Business\n* Management and Technology\n* Lauder Institute\n* Health Economics\n* Networked and Social Systems Engineering\n* Molecular Life Science\n* Public Policy\n* Diplomacy and Global Engagement\n |\n| Places | * University City\n* Annenberg Center\n* College Hall\n* College Houses\n* David Rittenhouse Laboratory\n* Fisher Fine Arts Library\n* Historic District\n* Houston Hall\n* Institute of Contemporary Art\n* Irvine Auditorium\n* Kelly Writers House\n* Meyerson Hall\n* Moore School\n* Morris Arboretum\n* Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology\n* New Bolton Center\n* Penn Park\n* Perelman Quadrangle\n* The Quadrangle\n* Richards Laboratories\n* Van Pelt Library\n |\n| Athletics | * Penn Quakers\n* Band\n* \"Fight on, Pennsylvania!\"\n* Basketball\n\t+ Men's\n\t+ Women's\n* Football\n* College Boat Club\n* Lacrosse\n* Penn Relays\n* Soccer\n\t+ Men's\n\t+ Women's\n* Men's squash\n* Class of 1923 Arena\n* Franklin Field\n* Meiklejohn Stadium\n* Palestra\n |\n| Media | * *The Daily Pennsylvanian*\n\t+ *34th Street Magazine*\n\t+ *Under the Button*\n* *Pennsylvania Punch Bowl*\n* Penn Press\n* Wharton School Publishing\n* WQHS\n* WXPN\n |\n| Life | * Student life\n* Penn Band\n* Mask and Wig\n* Glee Club\n* Masala\n* MERT\n* Philomathean Society\n* Penn Club of New York\n* \"Hail, Pennsylvania!\"\n* \"The Red and Blue\"\n |\n| People | * **President:** J.
