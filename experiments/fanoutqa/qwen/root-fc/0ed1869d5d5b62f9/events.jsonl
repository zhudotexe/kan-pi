The league consists of 30 teams, of which 29 are located in the United States and one in Canada. In the NBA, a head coach is the highest ranking coach of a coaching staff.\n\n\nGregg Popovich has served as head coach of the San Antonio Spurs for 27 years. No other current NBA head coach has been head coach of his current team as long as Popovich has been head coach of the Spurs. Popovich has also coached more games (2,127), won more games (1,366), and lost more games (761) than any other active head coach has with his current team. Miami Heat head coach Erik Spoelstra is the second longest-tenured NBA head coach, having been head coach of the Heat since the 2008–09 season. Popovich is the only active head coach inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame as a coach.[1] Popovich is the only current head coach to have been hired by his current team in the 1990s.\n\n\nAs of June 13, 2023, 15 coaches have spent their entire NBA head coaching careers with their current teams: Gregg Popovich with the San Antonio Spurs, Erik Spoelstra with the Miami Heat, Steve Kerr with the Golden State Warriors, Taylor Jenkins with the Memphis Grizzlies, Mark Daigneault with the Oklahoma City Thunder, Chris Finch with the Minnesota Timberwolves, Chauncey Billups with the Portland Trail Blazers, Jamahl Mosley with the Orlando Magic, Wes Unseld Jr. with the Washington Wizards, Willie Green with the New Orleans Pelicans, Darvin Ham with the Los Angeles Lakers, Joe Mazzulla with the Boston Celtics, Adrian Griffin with the Milwaukee Bucks, and Darko Rajaković with the Toronto Raptors.\n\n\nPopovich, Spoelstra, Kerr, and Michael Malone have won NBA championships with their current teams, while Rick Carlisle, Tyronn Lue, Nick Nurse, and Frank Vogel have won with their former teams.\n\n\n\n\n## Key[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **GC** | Games coached\n |\n| **W** | Wins\n |\n| **L** | Losses\n |\n| **Win%** | Winning percentage |\n| \\*\n | Spent entire NBA head coaching career with the current franchise\n |\n| †\n | Elected to the Basketball Hall of Fame as a coach\n |\n\n\n## Coaches[edit]\n\n\n*Note: Statistics are correct through the end of the 2022–23 season.*\n\n\n\n\n\n| Head coach\n | Team\n | Division\n | Conference\n | Start date[a] | GC\n | W\n | L\n | Win%\n | GC\n | W\n | L\n | Win%\n | Ref.\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Current[b] | Career[c] |\n| Quin Snyder | Atlanta Hawks | Southeast | Eastern | February 26, 2023 | 21 | 10 | 11 | .476\n | 657 | 382 | 275 | .581\n | [2][3] |\n| Joe Mazzulla\\*\n | Boston Celtics | Atlantic | Eastern\n | February 16, 2023 | 82 | 57 | 25 | .695\n | 82 | 57 | 25 | .695\n | [4][5][6] |\n| Jacque Vaughn | Brooklyn Nets | Atlantic\n | Eastern\n | November 1, 2022 | 75 | 43 | 32 | .573\n | 301 | 108 | 193 | .359\n | [7][8] |\n| Steve Clifford | Charlotte Hornets | Southeast\n | Eastern\n | June 24, 2022 | 82 | 27 | 55 | .329\n | 719 | 319 | 400 | .444\n | [9][10] |\n| Billy Donovan | Chicago Bulls | Central | Eastern\n | September 22, 2020 | 236 | 117 | 119 | .496\n | 636 | 360 | 276 | .566\n | [11][12] |\n| J.

The league consists of 30 teams, of which 29 are located in the United States and one in Canada. In the NBA, a head coach is the highest ranking coach of a coaching staff.\n\n\nGregg Popovich has served as head coach of the San Antonio Spurs for 27 years. No other current NBA head coach has been head coach of his current team as long as Popovich has been head coach of the Spurs. Popovich has also coached more games (2,127), won more games (1,366), and lost more games (761) than any other active head coach has with his current team. Miami Heat head coach Erik Spoelstra is the second longest-tenured NBA head coach, having been head coach of the Heat since the 2008–09 season.

They initially owed another second-round pick to the Miami Heat that they initially acquired from the Nuggets, but the pick was forfeited after the league found that the Heat violated tampering rules with Kyle Lowry in free agency.[7]\n\n\n\n## Roster\n\n[edit]\n\n\n\n**2022–23 Philadelphia 76ers roster**\n| Players\n | Coaches\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| \n\n| Pos. | No. | Name\n | Height\n | Weight\n | DOB\n | From\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| C | 14 | Dedmon, Dewayne | 6 ft 10 in (2.08 m)\n | 245 lb (111 kg)\n | 1989-08-12\n | USC |\n| C | 21 | Embiid, Joel | 7 ft 0 in (2.13 m)\n | 280 lb (127 kg)\n | 1994-03-16\n | Kansas |\n| G | 1 | Harden, James | 6 ft 5 in (1.96 m)\n | 220 lb (100 kg)\n | 1989-08-26\n | Arizona State |\n| F/C | 5 | Harrell, Montrezl | 6 ft 7 in (2.01 m)\n | 240 lb (109 kg)\n | 1994-01-26\n | Louisville |\n| F | 12 | Harris, Tobias | 6 ft 8 in (2.03 m)\n | 226 lb (103 kg)\n | 1992-07-15\n | Tennessee |\n| F | 25 | House, Danuel Jr. | 6 ft 6 in (1.98 m)\n | 220 lb (100 kg)\n | 1993-06-07\n | Texas A&M |\n| F | 23 | King, Louis (TW)\n | 6 ft 7 in (2.01 m)\n | 205 lb (93 kg)\n | 1999-04-06\n | Oregon |\n| G/F | 30 | Korkmaz, Furkan | 6 ft 7 in (2.01 m)\n | 202 lb (92 kg)\n | 1997-07-24\n | Turkey |\n| G | 0 | Maxey, Tyrese | 6 ft 2 in (1.88 m)\n | 200 lb (91 kg)\n | 2000-10-04\n | Kentucky |\n| G | 9 | McClung, Mac (TW)\n | 6 ft 2 in (1.88 m)\n | 185 lb (84 kg)\n | 1999-01-06\n | Texas Tech |\n| F | 7 | McDaniels, Jalen | 6 ft 9 in (2.06 m)\n | 205 lb (93 kg)\n | 1998-01-31\n | San Diego State |\n| G | 8 | Melton, De'Anthony | 6 ft 2 in (1.88 m)\n | 200 lb (91 kg)\n | 1998-05-28\n | USC |\n| G/F | 18 | Milton, Shake | 6 ft 5 in (1.96 m)\n | 205 lb (93 kg)\n | 1996-09-26\n | SMU |\n| F | 20 | Niang, Georges | 6 ft 7 in (2.01 m)\n | 230 lb (104 kg)\n | 1993-06-17\n | Iowa State |\n| F | 44 | Reed, Paul | 6 ft 9 in (2.06 m)\n | 210 lb (95 kg)\n | 1999-06-26\n | DePaul |\n| G | 11 | Springer, Jaden | 6 ft 3 in (1.91 m)\n | 202 lb (92 kg)\n | 2002-09-25\n | Tennessee |\n| F | 17 | Tucker, P.

They initially owed another second-round pick to the Miami Heat that they initially acquired from the Nuggets, but the pick was forfeited after the league found that the Heat violated tampering rules with Kyle Lowry in free agency.[7]\n\n\n\n## Roster\n\n[edit]\n\n\n\n**2022–23 Philadelphia 76ers roster**\n| Players\n | Coaches\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| \n\n| Pos. | No. | Name\n | Height\n | Weight\n | DOB\n | From\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| C | 14 | Dedmon, Dewayne | 6 ft 10 in (2.08 m)\n | 245 lb (111 kg)\n | 1989-08-12\n | USC |\n| C | 21 | Embiid, Joel | 7 ft 0 in (2.13 m)\n | 280 lb (127 kg)\n | 1994-03-16\n | Kansas |\n| G | 1 | Harden, James | 6 ft 5 in (1.96 m)\n | 220 lb (100 kg)\n | 1989-08-26\n | Arizona State |\n| F/C | 5 | Harrell, Montrezl | 6 ft 7 in (2.01 m)\n | 240 lb (109 kg)\n | 1994-01-26\n | Louisville |\n| F | 12 | Harris, Tobias | 6 ft 8 in (2.03 m)\n | 226 lb (103 kg)\n | 1992-07-15\n | Tennessee |\n| F | 25 | House, Danuel Jr. | 6 ft 6 in (1.98 m)\n | 220 lb (100 kg)\n | 1993-06-07\n | Texas A&M |\n| F | 23 | King, Louis (TW)\n | 6 ft 7 in (2.01 m)\n | 205 lb (93 kg)\n | 1999-04-06\n | Oregon |\n| G/F | 30 | Korkmaz, Furkan | 6 ft 7 in (2.01 m)\n | 202 lb (92 kg)\n | 1997-07-24\n | Turkey |\n| G | 0 | Maxey, Tyrese | 6 ft 2 in (1.88 m)\n | 200 lb (91 kg)\n | 2000-10-04\n | Kentucky |\n| G | 9 | McClung, Mac (TW)\n | 6 ft 2 in (1.88 m)\n | 185 lb (84 kg)\n | 1999-01-06\n | Texas Tech |\n| F | 7 | McDaniels, Jalen | 6 ft 9 in (2.06 m)\n | 205 lb (93 kg)\n | 1998-01-31\n | San Diego State |\n| G | 8 | Melton, De'Anthony | 6 ft 2 in (1.88 m)\n | 200 lb (91 kg)\n | 1998-05-28\n | USC |\n| G/F | 18 | Milton, Shake | 6 ft 5 in (1.96 m)\n | 205 lb (93 kg)\n | 1996-09-26\n | SMU |\n| F | 20 | Niang, Georges | 6 ft 7 in (2.01 m)\n | 230 lb (104 kg)\n | 1993-06-17\n | Iowa State |\n| F | 44 | Reed, Paul | 6 ft 9 in (2.06 m)\n | 210 lb (95 kg)\n | 1999-06-26\n | DePaul |\n| G | 11 | Springer, Jaden | 6 ft 3 in (1.91 m)\n | 202 lb (92 kg)\n | 2002-09-25\n | Tennessee |\n| F | 17 | Tucker, P.
