Of 3711 passengers and crew, around 700 people became infected and 9 people died.[91][92]\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic spread to many military ships. The nature of these ships, which includes working with others in small enclosed areas and a lack of private quarters for the vast majority of crew, contributed to the rapid spread of the disease, even more so than on cruise ships.[93][94]\n\n\n\nDue to the nature of operations security, national militaries may have policies in place that prevent or restrict reporting of SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19 deaths, so although the cases listed below may have been widely reported in reliable sources, confirmation by official spokespeople of the respective militaries is not systematic.[95]\n\n## Timeline of first confirmed cases by country or territory[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n2022 monthly cumulative COVID-19 deaths[24][25][26]\n|  | Location\n | Jan 1\n | Feb 1\n | Mar 1\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | World\n | 5,440,722 | 5,682,684 | 5,954,004\n |\n| ![](image) | United States | 819,197 | 881,867 | 941,112\n |\n| ![](image) | Brazil | 618,984 | 626,854 | 649,134\n |\n| ![](image) | India | 481,486 | 496,242 | 514,023\n |\n| ![](image) | Russia | 309,707 | 332,012 | 352,446\n |\n| ![](image) | Mexico | 301,663 | 310,131 | 318,149\n |\n| ![](image) | Peru | 202,653 | 205,505 | 210,538\n |\n| ![](image) | United Kingdom | 149,790 | 157,677 | 161,754\n |\n| ![](image) | Italy | 137,402 | 146,498 | 154,767\n |\n| ![](image) | Indonesia | 144,096 | 144,348 | 148,660\n |\n| ![](image) | Colombia | 129,901 | 134,079 | 138,693\n |\n| ![](image) | Iran | 131,606 | 132,454 | 136,838\n |\n| ![](image) | France | 121,149 | 128,120 | 135,262\n |\n| ![](image) | Argentina | 117,146 | 120,988 | 126,152\n |\n| ![](image) | Germany | 112,109 | 117,974 | 122,937\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n20. **^** World map of share of people who have received at least one vaccine dose by relative population of a country.
