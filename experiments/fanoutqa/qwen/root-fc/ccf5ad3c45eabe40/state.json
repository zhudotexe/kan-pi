She was a shy and quiet girl who was not confident with her physical appearance, but one day she overheard Yuji talking kindly of her, which made Yuko develop a crush on him. In the present day, she has lost weight and grown taller. When she saw Yuji was also in Tokyo, she asked Nobara about him, believing she has a chance with Yuji now with her new appearance. She later realized she was not so different from the people she did not like when Yuji could still recognize her even with her big change.\n\n\n\n### Saori[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nVoiced by: Asami Seto[3] (Japanese); Anne Yatco[4] (English)\nNobara Kugisaki (\u91d8\u5d0e \u91ce\u8594\u8587, *Kugisaki Nobara*) is a sorcerer studying in the first year at the Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School under the tutelage of Gojo.

His curse technique allows him to absorb and control natural curses and use them for combat. During his time at Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High, Geto was an excellent student, as well as considered to be the strongest along with Gojo. After the Star Plasma Vessel mission failed, he developed a strong hatred for people without magical powers to the point of wanting to exterminate them all to give life to a world of sorcerers only, an act that, according to him, it would prevent the creation of cursed spirits and consequently end the cycle in which all sorcerers are trapped. He is later confirmed to have been killed by Gojo at the end of Volume 0, leaving his body free to be possessed by the ancient evil sorcerer, Kenjaku, who would then take on Geto's identity.\n\n\n\n#### Nanako Hasaba[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThough he managed to push Mahito far, he soon met his end at the cursed spirit's hands.

Like Maki, he was born with a Heavenly Restriction, rendering him unable to use Cursed Techniques. In exchange, he was given immense physical prowess, and his senses reached a point where he could still interact with Cursed Spirits. His lack of Cursed Energy allows him to sneak up on and kill Jujutsu Sorcerers. He defeated Gojo and Geto on their first encounter, bringing Gojo to the brink of death.

After training with Gojo and the other students, Yuta learns to control his cursed energy and becomes a skilled swordsman. Even after Rika's curse is lifted, Yuta maintains his Special-Grade ranking, so much so that he can beat Suguru Geto, and Gojo has stated that Yuta has the potential to overcome him. Yuta's great power comes from being a descendant of one of the three great sorcerer clans (which makes him a distant relative to Gojo) and is the reason he cursed Rika when he refused her death at a young age.

He convinces his superiors at the college to keep Yuji Itadori alive until he consumes all of Sukuna's fingers. He teaches Yuji, Megumi Fushiguro, and Nobara Kugisaki.

He is sadistic, immature, and loves to play with human emotions, even when his life is in danger. He believes life has no value or meaning; therefore, everyone should do what they want. This mentality seems to stem from Mahito's ability to perceive and manipulate souls, which makes him see the soul (and, by extension, the heart) as nothing more than an object. His cursed power allows him to manipulate the soul of himself and others by changing the body's shape, thus enabling him to transfigure the bodies of his victims by turning them into disfigured creatures at his service. During the Shibuya Incident, he murders K\u014dkichi Muta and Kento Nanami, and severely injuring Nobara Kugisaki and Aoi Todo.

Following Yuta's advice, Megumi and Yuji seek him out to gain his help against Kenjaku, and soon find him at his illegal fight club. Upon hearing that Gojo has been sealed and Yaga was executed, Kinji agrees to help defeat Kenjaku. He later shows up in the Tokyo No. 2 Colony of the Culling Games, in an attempt to recruit French sorcerer and manga artist, Charles Bernard to their battle against Kenjaku. His innate technique allows him to spontaneously create and manipulate Pachinko machine parts, such as sliding doors. \n</fragment>\n</document>",
