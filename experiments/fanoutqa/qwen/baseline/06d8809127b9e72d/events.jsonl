The current tallest tree is the Hyperion tree, measuring 115.61 m (379.3 ft).[37] The tree was discovered in Redwood National Park during mid-2006 by Chris Atkins and Michael Taylor, and is thought to be the world's tallest living organism. The previous record holder was the Stratosphere Giant in Humboldt Redwoods State Park at 112.84 m (370.2 ft) (as measured in 2004). Until it fell in March 1991, the \"Dyerville Giant\" was the record holder. It, too, stood in Humboldt Redwoods State Park and was 113.4 m (372 ft) high and estimated to be 1,600 years old.

It is an evergreen, long-lived, monoecious tree living 1,200–2,200 years or more.[4] This species includes the tallest living trees on Earth, reaching up to 115.9 m (380.1 ft) in height (without the roots) and up to 8.9 m (29 ft) in diameter at breast height. These trees are also among the longest-living organisms on Earth. Before commercial logging and clearing began by the 1850s, this massive tree occurred naturally in an estimated 810,000 ha (2,000,000 acres)[5][6][7] along much of coastal California (excluding southern California where rainfall is not sufficient) and the southwestern corner of coastal Oregon within the United States.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n42. **^** Harris, S.

About 230 examples (including growths and sprouts) are known to exist,[75] reaching heights of up to 20 m (66 ft).[76] These trees survive like parasites, obtaining food from green parent trees. While similar mutations occur sporadically in other conifers, no cases are known of such individuals surviving to maturity in any other conifer species.[*citation needed*] Recent research news reports that albino redwoods can store higher concentrations of toxic metals, going so far as comparing them to organs or \"waste dumps\".[77][78]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe ability of Coast Redwood to live for more than a thousand years, along with its unusual capacity to resprout from its root crown when felled by natural or human causes, have earned this species the label of \"carbon-sequestration champion.\"[29] Its potential to contribute toward climate change mitigation, as well as its demonstrated ability to thrive in coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest,[30][31] led to the formation of a citizen group in Seattle, Washington undertaking assisted migration of this species hundreds of miles north of its native range.[32][33]\n\n\n\nIn contrast to cautionary statements made by forestry professionals assessing other tree species for assisted migration,[34] the citizens involved with the group known as PropagationNation have met with little controversy.

It was encouraged by tax laws that exempted all standing timber from taxation if 70% of trees in the area were harvested.[36] Selection logging, by contrast, called for the removal 25% to 50% of mature trees in the hopes that the remaining trees would allow for future growth and reseeding.[56] This method, however, encouraged growth of other tree species, converting redwood forests into mixed forests of redwood, grand fir, Sitka spruce, and western hemlock.[56][36] Moreover, the trees left standing were often felled by windthrow; that is, they were often blown over by the wind.\n\n\nThe coast redwood is naturalized in New Zealand, notably at Whakarewarewa Forest, Rotorua.[57] Redwood has been grown in New Zealand plantations for more than 100 years, and those planted in New Zealand have higher growth rates than those in California, mainly because of even rainfall distribution through the year.[58]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Taxon identifiers\n |\n| --- |\n| *Sequoia sempervirens* | * Wikidata: Q150129\n* Wikispecies: Sequoia sempervirens\n* APNI: 126131\n* ARKive: sequoia-sempervirens\n* Calflora: 7531\n* CoL: 4WSQG\n* EoL: 1034849\n* EPPO: SEQSE\n* Euro+Med PlantBase: 62fc1aa8-5072-4e13-87ab-acbbf173187c\n* FEIS: seqsem\n* FloraBase: 17808\n* FNA: 200005399\n* FoC: 200005399\n* GBIF: 2683909\n* GRIN: 33710\n* iNaturalist: 47372\n* IPNI: 263741-1\n* IRMNG: 11325771\n* ITIS: 183435\n* IUCN: 34051\n* MoBotPF: 287323\n* NatureServe: 2.140518\n* NBN: NHMSYS0000463454\n* NCBI: 28980\n* NZOR: 280c5830-f56e-4682-888e-8bff3e3c803e\n* NZPCN: 2681\n* Observation.org: 144016\n* Open Tree of Life: 538150\n* PfaF: Sequoia sempervirens\n* PFI: 9112\n* Plant List: kew-2484394\n* PLANTS: SESE3\n* POWO: urn:lsid:ipni.org:names:263741-1\n* RHS: 17252\n* Tropicos: 31300228\n* VicFlora: 7eef6dbe-3e4e-46ba-b657-f61abb58d842\n* WFO: wfo-0000437871\n |\n| *Taxodium sempervirens* | * Wikidata: Q17363914\n* APNI: 205500\n* CoL: 5526R\n* GBIF: 2683910\n* GRIN: 80069\n* IPNI: 263779-1\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n52. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Earles, J.

Coast redwood trees were used in a display at Rockefeller Center and then given to Longhouse Reserve in East Hampton, Long Island, New York, and these have now been living there for over twenty years and have survived at 2 °F (−17 °C).[60]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n6. **^** Kreissman, Bern; Lekisch, Barbara (1991). *California, an Environmental Atlas & Guide*.

These properties are conferred by concentrations of terpenoids and tannic acid in redwood leaves, roots, bark, and wood.[36] Despite these chemical defenses, redwoods are still subject to insect infestations; none, however, are capable of killing a healthy tree.[36] Redwoods also face herbivory from mammals: black bears are reported to consume the inner bark of small redwoods, and black-tailed deer are known to eat redwood sprouts.[36]\n\n\nThe oldest known coast redwood is about 2,200 years old;[37] many others in the wild exceed 600 years. The numerous claims of older redwoods are incorrect.[37] Because of their seemingly timeless lifespans, coast redwoods were deemed the \"everlasting redwood\" at the turn of the century; in Latin, *sempervirens* means \"ever green\" or \"everlasting\". Redwoods must endure various environmental disturbances to attain such great ages.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nCoast redwoods occupy a narrow strip of land approximately 750 km (470 mi) in length and 8–75 km (5–47 mi) in width along the Pacific coast of North America; the most southerly grove is in Monterey County, California, and the most northerly groves are in extreme southwestern Oregon. The prevailing elevation range is 30–750 m (100–2,460 ft) above sea level, occasionally down to 0 and up to about 900 m (3,000 ft).[17] They usually grow in the mountains where precipitation from the incoming moisture off the ocean is greater. The tallest and oldest trees are found in deep valleys and gullies, where year-round streams can flow, and fog drip is regular. The terrain also made it harder for loggers to get to the trees and to get them out after felling. The trees above the fog layer, above about 700 m (2,300 ft), are shorter and smaller due to the drier, windier, and colder conditions. In addition, Douglas-fir, pine, and tanoak often crowd out redwoods at these elevations. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n33. **^** Opong, Diana; Anderson, Hans (9 November 2023). \"One man's mission to save the California redwoods by bringing them to the Pacific Northwest\".

In California, 3,640 km2 (899,000 acres) of redwood forest are logged, virtually all of it second growth.[1] Though many entities have existed in the cutting and management of redwoods, perhaps none has had a more storied role than the Pacific Lumber Company (1863–2008) of Humboldt County, California, where it owned and managed over 810 km2 (200,000 acres) of forests, primarily redwood. Coast redwood lumber is highly valued for its beauty, light weight, and resistance to decay. Its lack of resin makes it absorb water[55] and resist fire.\n\n\nP. H. Shaughnessy, Chief Engineer of the San Francisco Fire Department wrote:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIts genetic makeup is unusual among conifers, being a hexaploid (6n) and possibly allopolyploid (AAAABB).[9] Both the mitochondrial and chloroplast genomes of the redwood are paternally inherited.[10]\n\n\n\n## Taxonomy[edit]\n\n\nScottish botanist David Don described the redwood as the evergreen taxodium (*Taxodium sempervirens*) in his colleague Aylmer Bourke Lambert's 1824 work *A description of the genus Pinus*.[11] Austrian botanist Stephan Endlicher erected the genus *Sequoia* in his 1847 work *Synopsis coniferarum*, giving the redwood its current binomial name of *Sequoia sempervirens*.[12] It is unknown how Endlicher derived the name Sequoia. See *Sequoia* Etymology.\n\n\nThe redwood is one of three living species, each in its own genus, in the subfamily Sequoioideae. Molecular studies have shown that the three are each other's closest relatives, generally with the redwood and giant sequoia (*Sequoiadendron giganteum*) as each other's closest relatives.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n10. **^** Neale, DB; Marshall, KA; Sederoff, RR (1989). \"Chloroplast and Mitochondrial DNA are Paternally Inherited in Sequoia sempervirens\". *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences*. **86** (23): 9347–9349.

This is partly due to technical difficulties in measurement, and variations in the shape of trees and their trunks. Measurements of trunk circumference are taken at only a few predetermined heights up the trunk, and assume that the trunk is circular in cross-section, and that taper between measurement points is even. Also, only the volume of the trunk (including the restored volume of basal fire scars) is taken into account, and not the volume of wood in the branches or roots.[80] The volume measurements also do not take cavities into account. Most coast redwoods with volumes greater than 850 m3 (30,000 cu ft) represent ancient fusions of two or more separate trees, which makes determining whether a coast redwood has a single stem or multiple stems difficult.[81] Starting in 2014, more record-breaking coast redwood trees were discovered. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe height of *S. sempervirens* is closely tied to fog availability; taller trees become less frequent as fog becomes less frequent.[42] As *S. sempervirens*' height increases, transporting water via water potential to the leaves becomes increasingly difficult due to gravity.[43][44][45] Despite the high rainfall that the region receives (up to 100 cm), the leaves in the upper canopy are perpetually stressed for water.[46][47] This water stress is exacerbated by long droughts in the summer.[48] Water stress is believed to cause the morphological changes in the leaves, stimulating reduced leaf length and increased leaf succulence.[44][49] To supplement their water needs, redwoods use frequent summer fog events. Fog water is absorbed through multiple pathways. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Fog is of major importance in coast redwood ecology. Redwood National Park.\nThe native area provides a unique environment with heavy seasonal rains up to 2,500 mm (100 in) annually. Cool coastal air and fog drip keep the forest consistently damp year round. Several factors, including the heavy rainfall, create a soil with fewer nutrients than the trees need, causing them to depend heavily on the entire biotic community of the forest, and making efficient recycling of dead trees especially important. This forest community includes coast Douglas-fir, Pacific madrone, tanoak, western hemlock, and other trees, along with a wide variety of ferns, mosses, mushrooms, and redwood sorrel. Redwood forests provide habitat for a variety of amphibians, birds, mammals, and reptiles. Old-growth redwood stands provide habitat for the federally threatened spotted owl and the California-endangered marbled murrelet.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2022 a Canadian Forestry Service publication used northward horticultural plantings, along with a review of research detailing redwood's paleobiogeography and current range conditions, as grounds for proposing that Canada's Vancouver Island already offered \"narrow strips of optimal habitat\" for extending the range of coast redwood.[35] The authors point to a topographical \"bottleneck\" north of the California border that could have impeded northward migration during the Holocene. The bottleneck entails a lack of lowland passages through an east-west mountain range in southern Oregon, coupled with the absence of coastal landscapes beyond storm salt-spray and tsunami inundation — for which this conifer species is highly intolerant.\n\n\n\n## Ecology[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHowever, Yang and colleagues in 2010 queried the polyploid state of the redwood and speculate that it may have arisen as an ancient hybrid between ancestors of the giant sequoia and dawn redwood (*Metasequoia*). Using two different single copy nuclear genes, LFY and NLY, to generate phylogenetic trees, they found that *Sequoia* was clustered with *Metasequoia* in the tree generated using the LFY gene, but with *Sequoiadendron* in the tree generated with the NLY gene. Further analysis strongly supported the hypothesis that *Sequoia* was the result of a hybridization event involving *Metasequoia* and *Sequoiadendron*. Thus, Yang and colleagues hypothesize that the inconsistent relationships among *Metasequoia*, *Sequoia,* and *Sequoiadendron* could be a sign of reticulate evolution (in which two species hybridize and give rise to a third) among the three genera. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn response to forest fires, the trees have developed various adaptations. The thick, fibrous bark of coast redwoods is extremely fire-resistant; it grows to at least a foot thick and protects mature trees from fire damage.[38][39] In addition, the redwoods contain little flammable pitch or resin.[39] If damaged by fire, a redwood readily sprouts new branches or even an entirely new crown,[38][36] and if the parent tree is killed, new buds sprout from its base.[36] Fires, moreover, appear to actually benefit redwoods by causing substantial mortality in competing species while having only minor effects on redwood. Burned areas are favorable to the successful germination of redwood seeds.[38] A study published in 2010, the first to compare post-wildfire survival and regeneration of redwood and associated species, concluded fires of all severity increase the relative abundance of redwood and higher-severity fires provide the greatest benefit.[40]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"f44171f1-886f-415f-b07c-f6edf70140e3","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

It is an evergreen, long-lived, monoecious tree living 1,200–2,200 years or more.[4] This species includes the tallest living trees on Earth, reaching up to 115.9 m (380.1 ft) in height (without the roots) and up to 8.9 m (29 ft) in diameter at breast height. These trees are also among the longest-living organisms on Earth. Before commercial logging and clearing began by the 1850s, this massive tree occurred naturally in an estimated 810,000 ha (2,000,000 acres)[5][6][7] along much of coastal California (excluding southern California where rainfall is not sufficient) and the southwestern corner of coastal Oregon within the United States.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n42. **^** Harris, S.

About 230 examples (including growths and sprouts) are known to exist,[75] reaching heights of up to 20 m (66 ft).[76] These trees survive like parasites, obtaining food from green parent trees. While similar mutations occur sporadically in other conifers, no cases are known of such individuals surviving to maturity in any other conifer species.[*citation needed*] Recent research news reports that albino redwoods can store higher concentrations of toxic metals, going so far as comparing them to organs or \"waste dumps\".[77][78]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe ability of Coast Redwood to live for more than a thousand years, along with its unusual capacity to resprout from its root crown when felled by natural or human causes, have earned this species the label of \"carbon-sequestration champion.\"[29] Its potential to contribute toward climate change mitigation, as well as its demonstrated ability to thrive in coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest,[30][31] led to the formation of a citizen group in Seattle, Washington undertaking assisted migration of this species hundreds of miles north of its native range.[32][33]\n\n\n\nIn contrast to cautionary statements made by forestry professionals assessing other tree species for assisted migration,[34] the citizens involved with the group known as PropagationNation have met with little controversy.

It was encouraged by tax laws that exempted all standing timber from taxation if 70% of trees in the area were harvested.[36] Selection logging, by contrast, called for the removal 25% to 50% of mature trees in the hopes that the remaining trees would allow for future growth and reseeding.[56] This method, however, encouraged growth of other tree species, converting redwood forests into mixed forests of redwood, grand fir, Sitka spruce, and western hemlock.[56][36] Moreover, the trees left standing were often felled by windthrow; that is, they were often blown over by the wind.\n\n\nThe coast redwood is naturalized in New Zealand, notably at Whakarewarewa Forest, Rotorua.[57] Redwood has been grown in New Zealand plantations for more than 100 years, and those planted in New Zealand have higher growth rates than those in California, mainly because of even rainfall distribution through the year.[58]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Taxon identifiers\n |\n| --- |\n| *Sequoia sempervirens* | * Wikidata: Q150129\n* Wikispecies: Sequoia sempervirens\n* APNI: 126131\n* ARKive: sequoia-sempervirens\n* Calflora: 7531\n* CoL: 4WSQG\n* EoL: 1034849\n* EPPO: SEQSE\n* Euro+Med PlantBase: 62fc1aa8-5072-4e13-87ab-acbbf173187c\n* FEIS: seqsem\n* FloraBase: 17808\n* FNA: 200005399\n* FoC: 200005399\n* GBIF: 2683909\n* GRIN: 33710\n* iNaturalist: 47372\n* IPNI: 263741-1\n* IRMNG: 11325771\n* ITIS: 183435\n* IUCN: 34051\n* MoBotPF: 287323\n* NatureServe: 2.140518\n* NBN: NHMSYS0000463454\n* NCBI: 28980\n* NZOR: 280c5830-f56e-4682-888e-8bff3e3c803e\n* NZPCN: 2681\n* Observation.org: 144016\n* Open Tree of Life: 538150\n* PfaF: Sequoia sempervirens\n* PFI: 9112\n* Plant List: kew-2484394\n* PLANTS: SESE3\n* POWO: urn:lsid:ipni.org:names:263741-1\n* RHS: 17252\n* Tropicos: 31300228\n* VicFlora: 7eef6dbe-3e4e-46ba-b657-f61abb58d842\n* WFO: wfo-0000437871\n |\n| *Taxodium sempervirens* | * Wikidata: Q17363914\n* APNI: 205500\n* CoL: 5526R\n* GBIF: 2683910\n* GRIN: 80069\n* IPNI: 263779-1\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n52. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Earles, J.

It also does well in the Pacific Northwest (Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia), far north of its northernmost native range in southwestern Oregon. Coast redwood trees were used in a display at Rockefeller Center and then given to Longhouse Reserve in East Hampton, Long Island, New York, and these have now been living there for over twenty years and have survived at 2 °F (−17 °C).[60]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n6. **^** Kreissman, Bern; Lekisch, Barbara (1991). *California, an Environmental Atlas & Guide*.

These properties are conferred by concentrations of terpenoids and tannic acid in redwood leaves, roots, bark, and wood.[36] Despite these chemical defenses, redwoods are still subject to insect infestations; none, however, are capable of killing a healthy tree.[36] Redwoods also face herbivory from mammals: black bears are reported to consume the inner bark of small redwoods, and black-tailed deer are known to eat redwood sprouts.[36]\n\n\nThe oldest known coast redwood is about 2,200 years old;[37] many others in the wild exceed 600 years. The numerous claims of older redwoods are incorrect.[37] Because of their seemingly timeless lifespans, coast redwoods were deemed the \"everlasting redwood\" at the turn of the century; in Latin, *sempervirens* means \"ever green\" or \"everlasting\". Redwoods must endure various environmental disturbances to attain such great ages.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nCoast redwoods occupy a narrow strip of land approximately 750 km (470 mi) in length and 8–75 km (5–47 mi) in width along the Pacific coast of North America; the most southerly grove is in Monterey County, California, and the most northerly groves are in extreme southwestern Oregon. The prevailing elevation range is 30–750 m (100–2,460 ft) above sea level, occasionally down to 0 and up to about 900 m (3,000 ft).[17] They usually grow in the mountains where precipitation from the incoming moisture off the ocean is greater. The tallest and oldest trees are found in deep valleys and gullies, where year-round streams can flow, and fog drip is regular. The terrain also made it harder for loggers to get to the trees and to get them out after felling. The trees above the fog layer, above about 700 m (2,300 ft), are shorter and smaller due to the drier, windier, and colder conditions. In addition, Douglas-fir, pine, and tanoak often crowd out redwoods at these elevations. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n33. **^** Opong, Diana; Anderson, Hans (9 November 2023). \"One man's mission to save the California redwoods by bringing them to the Pacific Northwest\".

In California, 3,640 km2 (899,000 acres) of redwood forest are logged, virtually all of it second growth.[1] Though many entities have existed in the cutting and management of redwoods, perhaps none has had a more storied role than the Pacific Lumber Company (1863–2008) of Humboldt County, California, where it owned and managed over 810 km2 (200,000 acres) of forests, primarily redwood. Coast redwood lumber is highly valued for its beauty, light weight, and resistance to decay. Its lack of resin makes it absorb water[55] and resist fire.\n\n\nP. H. Shaughnessy, Chief Engineer of the San Francisco Fire Department wrote:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIts genetic makeup is unusual among conifers, being a hexaploid (6n) and possibly allopolyploid (AAAABB).[9] Both the mitochondrial and chloroplast genomes of the redwood are paternally inherited.[10]\n\n\n\n## Taxonomy[edit]\n\n\nScottish botanist David Don described the redwood as the evergreen taxodium (*Taxodium sempervirens*) in his colleague Aylmer Bourke Lambert's 1824 work *A description of the genus Pinus*.[11] Austrian botanist Stephan Endlicher erected the genus *Sequoia* in his 1847 work *Synopsis coniferarum*, giving the redwood its current binomial name of *Sequoia sempervirens*.[12] It is unknown how Endlicher derived the name Sequoia. See *Sequoia* Etymology.\n\n\nThe redwood is one of three living species, each in its own genus, in the subfamily Sequoioideae. Molecular studies have shown that the three are each other's closest relatives, generally with the redwood and giant sequoia (*Sequoiadendron giganteum*) as each other's closest relatives.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n10. **^** Neale, DB; Marshall, KA; Sederoff, RR (1989). \"Chloroplast and Mitochondrial DNA are Paternally Inherited in Sequoia sempervirens\". *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences*. **86** (23): 9347–9349.

This is partly due to technical difficulties in measurement, and variations in the shape of trees and their trunks. Measurements of trunk circumference are taken at only a few predetermined heights up the trunk, and assume that the trunk is circular in cross-section, and that taper between measurement points is even. Also, only the volume of the trunk (including the restored volume of basal fire scars) is taken into account, and not the volume of wood in the branches or roots.[80] The volume measurements also do not take cavities into account. Most coast redwoods with volumes greater than 850 m3 (30,000 cu ft) represent ancient fusions of two or more separate trees, which makes determining whether a coast redwood has a single stem or multiple stems difficult.[81] Starting in 2014, more record-breaking coast redwood trees were discovered. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe height of *S. sempervirens* is closely tied to fog availability; taller trees become less frequent as fog becomes less frequent.[42] As *S. sempervirens*' height increases, transporting water via water potential to the leaves becomes increasingly difficult due to gravity.[43][44][45] Despite the high rainfall that the region receives (up to 100 cm), the leaves in the upper canopy are perpetually stressed for water.[46][47] This water stress is exacerbated by long droughts in the summer.[48] Water stress is believed to cause the morphological changes in the leaves, stimulating reduced leaf length and increased leaf succulence.[44][49] To supplement their water needs, redwoods use frequent summer fog events. Fog water is absorbed through multiple pathways. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Fog is of major importance in coast redwood ecology. Redwood National Park.\nThe native area provides a unique environment with heavy seasonal rains up to 2,500 mm (100 in) annually. Cool coastal air and fog drip keep the forest consistently damp year round. Several factors, including the heavy rainfall, create a soil with fewer nutrients than the trees need, causing them to depend heavily on the entire biotic community of the forest, and making efficient recycling of dead trees especially important. This forest community includes coast Douglas-fir, Pacific madrone, tanoak, western hemlock, and other trees, along with a wide variety of ferns, mosses, mushrooms, and redwood sorrel. Redwood forests provide habitat for a variety of amphibians, birds, mammals, and reptiles. Old-growth redwood stands provide habitat for the federally threatened spotted owl and the California-endangered marbled murrelet.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2022 a Canadian Forestry Service publication used northward horticultural plantings, along with a review of research detailing redwood's paleobiogeography and current range conditions, as grounds for proposing that Canada's Vancouver Island already offered \"narrow strips of optimal habitat\" for extending the range of coast redwood.[35] The authors point to a topographical \"bottleneck\" north of the California border that could have impeded northward migration during the Holocene. The bottleneck entails a lack of lowland passages through an east-west mountain range in southern Oregon, coupled with the absence of coastal landscapes beyond storm salt-spray and tsunami inundation — for which this conifer species is highly intolerant.\n\n\n\n## Ecology[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHowever, Yang and colleagues in 2010 queried the polyploid state of the redwood and speculate that it may have arisen as an ancient hybrid between ancestors of the giant sequoia and dawn redwood (*Metasequoia*). Using two different single copy nuclear genes, LFY and NLY, to generate phylogenetic trees, they found that *Sequoia* was clustered with *Metasequoia* in the tree generated using the LFY gene, but with *Sequoiadendron* in the tree generated with the NLY gene. Further analysis strongly supported the hypothesis that *Sequoia* was the result of a hybridization event involving *Metasequoia* and *Sequoiadendron*. Thus, Yang and colleagues hypothesize that the inconsistent relationships among *Metasequoia*, *Sequoia,* and *Sequoiadendron* could be a sign of reticulate evolution (in which two species hybridize and give rise to a third) among the three genera. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn response to forest fires, the trees have developed various adaptations. The thick, fibrous bark of coast redwoods is extremely fire-resistant; it grows to at least a foot thick and protects mature trees from fire damage.[38][39] In addition, the redwoods contain little flammable pitch or resin.[39] If damaged by fire, a redwood readily sprouts new branches or even an entirely new crown,[38][36] and if the parent tree is killed, new buds sprout from its base.[36] Fires, moreover, appear to actually benefit redwoods by causing substantial mortality in competing species while having only minor effects on redwood. Burned areas are favorable to the successful germination of redwood seeds.[38] A study published in 2010, the first to compare post-wildfire survival and regeneration of redwood and associated species, concluded fires of all severity increase the relative abundance of redwood and higher-severity fires provide the greatest benefit.[40]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"f44171f1-886f-415f-b07c-f6edf70140e3","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
