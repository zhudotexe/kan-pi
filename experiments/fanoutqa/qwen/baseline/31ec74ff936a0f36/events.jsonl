Besides the *Star Wars* and *Superman* franchises, *James Bond* and *Godzilla* films are still being released periodically; all four are among the highest-grossing franchises. Some of the older films that held the record of highest-grossing film still have respectable grosses by today's standards, but no longer compete numerically against today's top-earners in an era of much higher individual ticket prices. When those prices are adjusted for inflation, however, then *Gone with the Wind*—which was the highest-grossing film outright for twenty-five years—is still the highest-grossing film of all time. All grosses on the list are expressed in U.S. dollars at their nominal value, except where stated otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n## Highest-grossing films[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | [# 3] |\n| 2021[97] | *Avatar* | $2,847,397,339 ‡ | [# 1] |\n| *2022* | $2,923,706,026 ‡ |\n\n\nRDistributor rental.\n\n\n‡Includes revenue from re-releases.

Grosses are not limited to original theatrical runs either, with many older films often being re-released periodically so the figures represent all the business a film has done since its original release; a film's first-run gross is included in brackets after the total if known. Because of incomplete data it cannot be known for sure how much money some films have made and when they made it, but generally the chart chronicles the films from each year that went on to earn the most. In the cases where estimates conflict both films are recorded, and in cases where a film has moved into first place because of being re-released the previous record-holder is also retained.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGS*Variety* put the worldwide rental for *The Greatest Show on Earth* at around $18.35 million (with $12.8 million coming from the United States[53]) a year after its release; however, Birchard puts its earnings at just over $15 million up to 1962. It is likely that Birchard's figure is just the North American gross rental, and includes revenue from the 1954 and 1960 reissues.\n\n\nSWThe \"first run\" *Star Wars* grosses do not include revenue from the 1997 special-edition releases; however, the figure does include revenue from the re-releases prior to the special editions.\n\n\nHP1The *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone* reissue totals recorded by Box Office Mojo for Brazil (2020), Italy (2021), Netherlands (2021) and South Korea (2021) have been deducted from the lifetime gross due to Box Office Mojo double-counting the original release grosses in those countries.\n\n\nHP8Production costs were shared with *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1*.\n\n## Timeline of highest-grossing films[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 16\n | *Pirates of the Caribbean* | $4,522,015,850\n | 5\n | $904,403,170\n | *Dead Man's Chest* ($1,066,179,747)\n |\n| 1\n | *Dead Man's Chest* (2006) | $1,066,179,747 |\n| 2\n | *On Stranger Tides* (2011) | $1,045,713,802 |\n| 3\n | *At World's End* (2007) | $960,996,492 |\n| 4\n | *Dead Men Tell No Tales* (2017) | $794,861,794 |\n| 5\n | *The Curse of the Black Pearl* (2003) | $654,264,015\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 17\n | *Mission: Impossible †* | $4,139,186,793\n | 7\n | $591,312,399\n | *Fallout* ($791,657,398)\n |\n| 1\n | *Fallout* (2018) | $791,657,398 |\n| 2\n | *Ghost Protocol* (2011) | $694,713,380 |\n| 3\n | *Rogue Nation* (2015) | $682,716,636 |\n| 4\n | *Dead Reckoning Part One* (2023) *†* | $567,535,383 |\n| 5\n | *Mission: Impossible 2* (2000) | $546,388,108 |\n| 6\n | *Mission: Impossible* (1996) | $457,696,391 |\n| 7\n | *Mission: Impossible III* (2006) | $398,479,497\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | *The Hobbit* | $2,932,078,431\n | 3\n | $977,359,477\n | *An Unexpected Journey* ($1,017,030,651)\n |\n| 1\n | *An Unexpected Journey* (2012) | $1,017,030,651 |\n| 2\n | *The Desolation of Smaug* (2013) | $959,027,992 |\n| 3\n | *The Battle of the Five Armies* (2014) | $956,019,788\n |\n\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | *The Lord of the Rings* (1978) | $30,471,420\n |  |\n\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 13\n | *Transformers* | $5,292,092,465\n | 8\n | $661,511,558\n | *Dark of the Moon* ($1,123,794,079)\n |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 1999 | *Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace* | $1,027,082,707 ($924,317,558)\n | $115,000,000–127,500,000 | [# 78][# 266] |\n| 2000 | *Mission: Impossible 2* | $546,388,108 | $100,000,000–125,000,000 | [# 297][# 274] |\n| 2001 | *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone* | $1,009,046,830HP1 ($974,755,371)\n | $125,000,000 | [# 298] |\n| 2002 | *The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers* | $948,734,205 ($936,689,735)\n | $94,000,000 | [# 299] |\n| 2003 | *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King* | $1,147,997,407 ($1,140,682,011)\n | $94,000,000 | [# 50] |\n| 2004 | *Shrek 2* | $928,760,770 | $150,000,000 | [# 300] |\n| 2005 | *Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire* | $896,346,413 ($895,921,036)\n | $150,000,000 | [# 301] |\n| 2006 | *Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest* | $1,066,179,747\n | $225,000,000 | [# 67] |\n| 2007 | *Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End* | $960,996,492 | $300,000,000 | [# 302] |\n| 2008 | *The Dark Knight* | $1,007,336,937 ($997,039,412)\n | $185,000,000 | [# 303] |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 1989 | *Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade* | $474,171,806–494,000,000 | $36,000,000–55,400,000 | [# 283][# 274][# 284] |\n| 1990 | *Ghost* | $505,870,681 ($505,702,588)\n | $22,000,000 | [# 285][# 274] |\n| 1991 | *Terminator 2: Judgment Day* | $523,774,456 ($519,843,345)\n | $94,000,000 | [# 286][# 287] |\n| 1992 | *Aladdin* | $504,050,219 | $28,000,000 | [# 288][# 146] |\n| 1993 | *Jurassic Park* | $1,037,535,230 ($912,667,947)\n | $63,000,000–70,000,000 | [# 73] |\n| 1994 | *The Lion King* | $968,511,805 ($763,455,561)\n | $45,000,000–79,300,000 | [# 289] |\n| 1995 | *Toy Story* | $373,554,033 ($364,873,776)\n | $30,000,000 | [# 290][# 291] |\n| *Die Hard with a Vengeance* | $366,101,666 | $70,000,000 | [# 292][# 293] |\n| 1996 | *Independence Day* | $817,400,891 | $75,000,000 | [# 294] |\n| 1997 | *Titanic* | $2,257,844,554 ($1,843,373,318)\n | $200,000,000 | [# 7] |\n| 1998 | *Armageddon* | $553,709,788 | $140,000,000 | [# 295][# 296] |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t+ \"X-Men – Worldwide (Unadjusted)\". *Box Office Mojo*.

Included on the list are charts of the top box-office earners (ranked by both the nominal and real value of their revenue), a chart of high-grossing films by calendar year, a timeline showing the transition of the highest-grossing film record, and a chart of the highest-grossing film franchises and series.

Besides the *Star Wars* and *Superman* franchises, *James Bond* and *Godzilla* films are still being released periodically; all four are among the highest-grossing franchises. Some of the older films that held the record of highest-grossing film still have respectable grosses by today's standards, but no longer compete numerically against today's top-earners in an era of much higher individual ticket prices. When those prices are adjusted for inflation, however, then *Gone with the Wind*—which was the highest-grossing film outright for twenty-five years—is still the highest-grossing film of all time. All grosses on the list are expressed in U.S. dollars at their nominal value, except where stated otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n## Highest-grossing films[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | [# 3] |\n| 2021[97] | *Avatar* | $2,847,397,339 ‡ | [# 1] |\n| *2022* | $2,923,706,026 ‡ |\n\n\nRDistributor rental.\n\n\n‡Includes revenue from re-releases.

Grosses are not limited to original theatrical runs either, with many older films often being re-released periodically so the figures represent all the business a film has done since its original release; a film's first-run gross is included in brackets after the total if known. Because of incomplete data it cannot be known for sure how much money some films have made and when they made it, but generally the chart chronicles the films from each year that went on to earn the most. In the cases where estimates conflict both films are recorded, and in cases where a film has moved into first place because of being re-released the previous record-holder is also retained.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGS*Variety* put the worldwide rental for *The Greatest Show on Earth* at around $18.35 million (with $12.8 million coming from the United States[53]) a year after its release; however, Birchard puts its earnings at just over $15 million up to 1962. It is likely that Birchard's figure is just the North American gross rental, and includes revenue from the 1954 and 1960 reissues.\n\n\nSWThe \"first run\" *Star Wars* grosses do not include revenue from the 1997 special-edition releases; however, the figure does include revenue from the re-releases prior to the special editions.\n\n\nHP1The *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone* reissue totals recorded by Box Office Mojo for Brazil (2020), Italy (2021), Netherlands (2021) and South Korea (2021) have been deducted from the lifetime gross due to Box Office Mojo double-counting the original release grosses in those countries.\n\n\nHP8Production costs were shared with *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1*.\n\n## Timeline of highest-grossing films[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 16\n | *Pirates of the Caribbean* | $4,522,015,850\n | 5\n | $904,403,170\n | *Dead Man's Chest* ($1,066,179,747)\n |\n| 1\n | *Dead Man's Chest* (2006) | $1,066,179,747 |\n| 2\n | *On Stranger Tides* (2011) | $1,045,713,802 |\n| 3\n | *At World's End* (2007) | $960,996,492 |\n| 4\n | *Dead Men Tell No Tales* (2017) | $794,861,794 |\n| 5\n | *The Curse of the Black Pearl* (2003) | $654,264,015\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 17\n | *Mission: Impossible †* | $4,139,186,793\n | 7\n | $591,312,399\n | *Fallout* ($791,657,398)\n |\n| 1\n | *Fallout* (2018) | $791,657,398 |\n| 2\n | *Ghost Protocol* (2011) | $694,713,380 |\n| 3\n | *Rogue Nation* (2015) | $682,716,636 |\n| 4\n | *Dead Reckoning Part One* (2023) *†* | $567,535,383 |\n| 5\n | *Mission: Impossible 2* (2000) | $546,388,108 |\n| 6\n | *Mission: Impossible* (1996) | $457,696,391 |\n| 7\n | *Mission: Impossible III* (2006) | $398,479,497\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | *The Hobbit* | $2,932,078,431\n | 3\n | $977,359,477\n | *An Unexpected Journey* ($1,017,030,651)\n |\n| 1\n | *An Unexpected Journey* (2012) | $1,017,030,651 |\n| 2\n | *The Desolation of Smaug* (2013) | $959,027,992 |\n| 3\n | *The Battle of the Five Armies* (2014) | $956,019,788\n |\n\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | *The Lord of the Rings* (1978) | $30,471,420\n |  |\n\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 13\n | *Transformers* | $5,292,092,465\n | 8\n | $661,511,558\n | *Dark of the Moon* ($1,123,794,079)\n |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 1999 | *Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace* | $1,027,082,707 ($924,317,558)\n | $115,000,000–127,500,000 | [# 78][# 266] |\n| 2000 | *Mission: Impossible 2* | $546,388,108 | $100,000,000–125,000,000 | [# 297][# 274] |\n| 2001 | *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone* | $1,009,046,830HP1 ($974,755,371)\n | $125,000,000 | [# 298] |\n| 2002 | *The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers* | $948,734,205 ($936,689,735)\n | $94,000,000 | [# 299] |\n| 2003 | *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King* | $1,147,997,407 ($1,140,682,011)\n | $94,000,000 | [# 50] |\n| 2004 | *Shrek 2* | $928,760,770 | $150,000,000 | [# 300] |\n| 2005 | *Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire* | $896,346,413 ($895,921,036)\n | $150,000,000 | [# 301] |\n| 2006 | *Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest* | $1,066,179,747\n | $225,000,000 | [# 67] |\n| 2007 | *Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End* | $960,996,492 | $300,000,000 | [# 302] |\n| 2008 | *The Dark Knight* | $1,007,336,937 ($997,039,412)\n | $185,000,000 | [# 303] |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 1989 | *Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade* | $474,171,806–494,000,000 | $36,000,000–55,400,000 | [# 283][# 274][# 284] |\n| 1990 | *Ghost* | $505,870,681 ($505,702,588)\n | $22,000,000 | [# 285][# 274] |\n| 1991 | *Terminator 2: Judgment Day* | $523,774,456 ($519,843,345)\n | $94,000,000 | [# 286][# 287] |\n| 1992 | *Aladdin* | $504,050,219 | $28,000,000 | [# 288][# 146] |\n| 1993 | *Jurassic Park* | $1,037,535,230 ($912,667,947)\n | $63,000,000–70,000,000 | [# 73] |\n| 1994 | *The Lion King* | $968,511,805 ($763,455,561)\n | $45,000,000–79,300,000 | [# 289] |\n| 1995 | *Toy Story* | $373,554,033 ($364,873,776)\n | $30,000,000 | [# 290][# 291] |\n| *Die Hard with a Vengeance* | $366,101,666 | $70,000,000 | [# 292][# 293] |\n| 1996 | *Independence Day* | $817,400,891 | $75,000,000 | [# 294] |\n| 1997 | *Titanic* | $2,257,844,554 ($1,843,373,318)\n | $200,000,000 | [# 7] |\n| 1998 | *Armageddon* | $553,709,788 | $140,000,000 | [# 295][# 296] |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t+ \"X-Men – Worldwide (Unadjusted)\". *Box Office Mojo*.

However, theatrical box-office earnings are the primary metric for trade publications in assessing the success of a film, mostly because of the availability of the data compared to sales figures for home video and broadcast rights, but also because of historical practice. Included on the list are charts of the top box-office earners (ranked by both the nominal and real value of their revenue), a chart of high-grossing films by calendar year, a timeline showing the transition of the highest-grossing film record, and a chart of the highest-grossing film franchises and series. All charts are ranked by international theatrical box-office performance where possible, excluding income derived from home video, broadcasting rights, and merchandise.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 6\n | *Avengers* | $7,767,486,137\n | 4\n | $1,941,871,534\n | *Endgame* ($2,797,501,328)\n |\n| 1\n | *Endgame* (2019) | $2,797,501,328 |\n| 2\n | *Infinity War* (2018) | $2,048,359,754 |\n| 3\n | *The Avengers* (2012) | $1,518,815,515 |\n| 4\n | *Age of Ultron* (2015) | $1,402,809,540\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 7\n | *Fast & Furious* | $7,333,501,460\n | 11\n | $666,681,951\n | *Furious 7* ($1,515,341,399)\n |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n13. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021)\". *Box Office Mojo*.
