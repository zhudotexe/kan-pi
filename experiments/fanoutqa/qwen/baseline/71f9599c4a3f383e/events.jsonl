The best-selling video game to date is *Minecraft*, a sandbox game released by Mojang in May 2009 for a wide range of PC, mobile and console platforms, selling more than 300 million copies across all platforms. *Grand Theft Auto V* and EA's *Tetris* are the only other known video games to have sold over 100 million copies. The best-selling game on a single platform is *Wii Sports*, with nearly 83 million sales for the Wii console. In 2023, *Minecraft* became the first video game to surpass 300 million copies sold worldwide.[1]\n\n\nAmong the top 50 best-selling video games on this list, over half were developed or published by Nintendo; five Nintendo titles were published with their affiliate, The Pokémon Company. Other publishers with multiple entries in the top 50 include Activision and Rockstar Games with four games, and Blizzard Entertainment, CD Projekt, Electronic Arts and Namco Bandai with two games. Nintendo EAD is the developer with the most games in the top 50, with thirteen titles on the list, followed by Game Freak with seven[a] *Pokémon* games. The oldest game in the top 50 is *Pac-Man*, released in May 1980, while the most recent is *Pokémon Scarlet* and *Violet*, released in November 2022.\n\n\n\n\n## List[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Title\n | Sales\n | Series\n | Platform(s)\n | Initial release date\n | Developer(s)[b] | Publisher(s)[b] | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| *Minecraft* | 300,000,000\n | *Minecraft* | Multi-platform\n | November 18, 2011[c] | Mojang Studios | Mojang Studios | [4] |\n| *Grand Theft Auto V* | 190,000,000\n | *Grand Theft Auto* | Multi-platform\n | September 17, 2013 | Rockstar North | Rockstar Games | [5] |\n| *Tetris* (EA) | 100,000,000\n | *Tetris* | Multi-platform\n | September 12, 2006 | EA Mobile | Electronic Arts | [6] |\n| *Wii Sports* | 82,900,000\n | *Wii* | Wii | November 19, 2006 | Nintendo EAD | Nintendo | [7] |\n| *PUBG: Battlegrounds* | 75,000,000\n | *PUBG Universe* | Multi-platform\n | December 20, 2017 | PUBG Corporation | Krafton | [8] |\n| *Mario Kart 8* / *Deluxe* | 65,470,000\n | *Mario Kart* | Wii U / Switch | May 29, 2014 | Nintendo EAD / Nintendo EPD (Deluxe)\n | Nintendo | [d] |\n| *Super Mario Bros.* | 58,000,000\n | *Super Mario* | Multi-platform\n | September 13, 1985 | Nintendo R&D4 | Nintendo | [e] |\n| *Red Dead Redemption 2* | 57,000,000\n | *Red Dead* | Multi-platform\n | October 26, 2018 | Rockstar Studios | Rockstar Games | [5] |\n| *Overwatch* | 50,000,000\n | *Overwatch* | Multi-platform\n | May 24, 2016 | Blizzard Entertainment | Blizzard Entertainment | [14] |\n| *The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt* | *The Witcher* | Multi-platform\n | May 19, 2015 | CD Projekt Red | CD Projekt | [15] |\n| *Tetris* (1989)[f] | 48,000,000\n | *Tetris* | Game Boy / NES | June 14, 1989 | Nintendo R&D1 | Nintendo | [g] |\n| *Pokémon Red / Green / Blue / Yellow* | 47,520,000\n | *Pokémon* | Multi-platform\n | February 27, 1996 | Game Freak | Nintendo | [h] |\n| *Terraria* | 44,500,000\n | None\n | Multi-platform\n | May 16, 2011 | Re-Logic | Re-Logic / 505 Games | [21] |\n| *Wii Fit / Plus* | 43,800,000\n | *Wii* | Wii\n | December 1, 2007 | Nintendo EAD | Nintendo | [i] |\n| *Animal Crossing: New Horizons* | 43,380,000\n | *Animal Crossing* | Nintendo Switch | March 20, 2020 | Nintendo EPD | Nintendo | [10] |\n| *Pac-Man* | 42,071,635\n | *Pac-Man* | Multi-platform\n | May 22, 1980 | Namco | Namco | [j] |\n| *Human: Fall Flat* | 40,000,000\n | None\n | Multi-platform\n | July 22, 2016 | No Brakes Games | Curve Digital | [32] |\n| *Mario Kart Wii* | 37,380,000\n | *Mario Kart* | Wii\n | April 10, 2008 | Nintendo EAD | Nintendo | [7] |\n| *Wii Sports Resort* | 33,140,000\n | *Wii* | Wii\n | June 25, 2009 | Nintendo EAD | Nintendo | [7] |\n| *The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild* | 32,850,000\n | *The Legend of Zelda* | Wii U / Switch\n | March 3, 2017 | Nintendo EPD | Nintendo | [k] |\n| *Super Smash Bros.
