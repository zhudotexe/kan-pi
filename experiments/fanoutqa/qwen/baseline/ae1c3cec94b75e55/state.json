Some of the struggles facing Dunham's character Hannah\u2014including being cut off financially from her parents, becoming a writer and making unfortunate decisions\u2014are inspired by Dunham's real-life experiences.[56]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe second season of *Girls* continued to receive critical acclaim. David Wiegland of the *San Francisco Chronicle* said that \"The entire constellation of impetuous, ambitious, determined and insecure young urbanites in *Girls* is realigning in the new season, but at no point in the four episodes sent to critics for review do you feel that any of it is artificial\".[66] Verne Gay of *Newsday* said it is \"Sharper, smarter, more richly layered, detailed and acted\".[67] Ken Tucker of *Entertainment Weekly* felt that \"As bright-eyed and bushy-tailed as it was in its first season, *Girls* may now be even spunkier, funnier, and riskier\".[68] The second season ran on HBO from January 2013 to March 2013, with third and fourth seasons subsequently being renewed. The third season of *Girls* premiered in January 2014 with over one million viewers.[69] The following month, Dunham hosted an episode of *Saturday Night Live* with musical guest The National.[70]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n81. **^** Cascone, Sarah (May 20, 2014). \"Laurie Simmons Casts Daughter Lena Dunham in New Film\". *Artnet.com*.
