Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, many former Warsaw Pact and post-Soviet states sought to join NATO. Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic became NATO members in 1999, amid much debate within NATO itself and Russian opposition. NATO then formalized the process of joining the organization with \"Membership Action Plans\", which aided the accession of seven Central and Eastern Europe countries shortly before the 2004 Istanbul summit: Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia. Two countries on the Adriatic Sea\u2014Albania and Croatia\u2014joined on 1 April 2009 before the 2009 Strasbourg\u2013Kehl summit. The next member states to join NATO were Montenegro on 5 June 2017, and North Macedonia on 27 March 2020.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs NATO Secretary General Willy Claes noted, the 1995 study did not specify the \"who or when,\"[100] though it discussed how the then newly formed Partnership for Peace and North Atlantic Cooperation Council could assist in the enlargement process,[101] and noted that on-going territorial disputes could be an issue for whether a country was invited.[102] At the 1997 Madrid summit, the heads of state of NATO issued the \"Madrid Declaration on Euro-Atlantic Security and Cooperation\" which invited three Central European countries to join the alliance, out of the twelve that had at that point requested to join, laying out a path for others to follow.[98] The text of Article 10 was the origin for the April 1999 statement of a \"NATO open door policy\".[103]\n\n\n\n### Membership Action Plan[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n66. **^** \"Albania, Croatia become NATO members\". *NBC News*.

In 2022, NATO signed protocols with Finland and Sweden on their accession following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Ukraine applied for membership in 2022. Finland joined NATO on 4 April 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn November 2002, NATO invited seven countries to join it via the MAP: Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia.[108] All seven invitees joined in March 2004, which was observed at a flag-raising ceremony on 2 April. After that date, NATO numbered 26 allies.[109] Other former MAP participants were Albania and Croatia between May 2002 and April 2009, Montenegro between December 2009 and June 2017, and North Macedonia between April 1999 and March 2020, when it joined NATO. As of 2022[update], there was only one country participating in a MAP, Bosnia and Herzegovina.[110]\n\n\n\n### Intensified dialogue[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNATO is a military alliance of thirty-one European and North American countries that constitutes a system of collective defense. The process of joining the alliance is governed by Article 10 of the North Atlantic Treaty, which allows for the invitation of \"other European States\" only and by subsequent agreements. Countries wishing to join must meet certain requirements and complete a multi-step process involving political dialog and military integration. The accession process is overseen by the North Atlantic Council, NATO's governing body. NATO was formed in 1949 with twelve founding members and has added new members nine times. The first additions were Greece and Turkey in 1952. In May 1955, West Germany joined NATO, which was one of the conditions agreed to as part of the end of the country's occupation by France, the United Kingdom, and the United States, prompting the Soviet Union to form its own collective security alliance (commonly called the Warsaw Pact) later that month. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNATO provides feedback as well as technical advice to each country and evaluates its progress on an individual basis.[105] Once members agree that a country meets the requirements, NATO can issue that country an invitation to begin accession talks.[106] The final accession process, once invited, involves five steps leading up to the signing of the accession protocols and the acceptance and ratification of those protocols by the governments of the current NATO members.[107]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n71. **^** Emmott, Robin; Siebold, Sabine (2 December 2015). \"NATO invites Montenegro to join alliance, defying Russia\". *Reuters*.

While 84% of those who identified as Bosniak or Croat supported NATO membership, only 9% of those who identified as Serb did.[141] Bosnian chances of joining NATO may depend on Serbia's attitude towards the alliance, since the leadership of Republika Srpska might be reluctant to go against Serbian interests.[142] In October 2017, the National Assembly of the Republika Srpska passed a nonbinding resolution opposing NATO membership for Bosnia and Herzegovina.[143] On 2 March 2022, Vjosa Osmani, the President of Kosovo, called on NATO to speed up the membership process for Kosovo and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Osmani also criticized Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107, the President of Serbia, accusing him of using Milorad Dodik to \"destroy the unity of Bosnia and Herzegovina\".[144]\n\n\n\n### Sweden[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Sweden\u2013NATO relations\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRussia was particularly upset with the addition of the three Baltic states, the first countries that were part of the Soviet Union to join NATO.[58][56] Russian troops had been stationed in Baltic states as late as 1995,[59] but the goals of European integration and NATO membership were very attractive for the Baltic states.[60] Rapid investments in their own armed forces showed a seriousness in their desire for membership, and participation in NATO-led post-9/11 operations, particularly by Estonia in Afghanistan, won the three countries key support from individuals like US Senator John McCain, French President Jacques Chirac, and German Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der.[59] A 2006 study in the journal *Security Studies* argued that the NATO enlargements in 1999 and 2004 contributed to democratic consolidation in Central and Eastern Europe.[61]\n\n\n\n### Adriatic Charter[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n127. **^** \"Finland and Sweden submit applications to join NATO\". *NATO*. 18 May 2022.

In May 2003, it joined with Albania and Macedonia to form the Adriatic Charter to support each other in their pursuit of membership.[62] Croatia's prospect of membership sparked a national debate on whether a referendum on NATO membership needed to be held before joining the organization. Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader ultimately agreed in January 2008, as part of forming a coalition government with the HSS and HSLS parties, not to officially propose one.[63] Albania and Croatia were invited to join NATO at the 2008 Bucharest summit that April, though Slovenia threatened to hold up Croatian membership over their border dispute in the Bay of Piran.[64] Slovenia did ratify Croatia's accession protocol in February 2009,[65] before Croatia and Albania both officially joined NATO just before the 2009 Strasbourg\u2013Kehl summit, with little opposition from Russia.[66]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nTwelve countries were part of NATO at the time of its founding: Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The start of the Cold War between 1947 and 1953 saw an ideological and economic divide between the capitalist states of Western Europe backed by United States with its Marshall Plan and the Truman Doctrine, and the communist states of Eastern Europe, backed by the Soviet Union. As such, opposition to Soviet-style communism became a defining characteristic of the organization and the anti-communist governments of Greece, which had just fought a civil war against a pro-communist army, and Turkey, whose newly-elected Democrat Party were staunchly pro-American, came under internal and external pressure to join the alliance, which both did in February 1952.[7][8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n121. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"NATO's relations with Bosnia and Herzegovina\".

First, only European states are eligible for new membership, and second, these states not only need the approval of all the existing member states, but every member state can put some criteria forward that have to be attained. In practice, NATO formulates a common set of criteria. However, for instance, Greece blocked the Republic of Macedonia's accession to NATO for many years because it disagreed with the use of the name Macedonia. Turkey similarly opposes the participation of the Republic of Cyprus with NATO institutions as long as the Cyprus dispute is not resolved.[97]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n305. **^** Skaluba, Christopher; Doyle, Gabriela (14 October 2020). \"Seek membership for Mexico\". *Atlantic Council*.
