Universities can have multiple campuses with a single administration.\n\n\n**What this list includes:**\n\n\n\n* On-campus and in person based class enrollment.\n* Enrollment is the sum of the headcount of undergraduate and graduate students.\n* Enrollment is counted by the 21st-day headcount, as provided to the United States Department of Education under the Common Data Set program.\n* Campuses that have small secondary physical locations that are not reported separately (for extended education, outreach, etc.) are indicated with a footnote.\n\n\n**What this list does not include:**\n\n\n\n* University systems, or universities that have multiple physical campuses.\n\n\nNot all enrollment counts are directly comparable. Universities have changed how they classify and report data. See notes. For other lists that measure university enrollment, see the see also section below.\n\n\n\n\n## 2022–23 enrollment[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| **Ten largest public university campuses by enrollment during the
