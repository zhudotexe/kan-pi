The principal factors in the process were a significant decline in household size, and a dramatic migration of residents to the suburbs between 1962 and 1975. Factors in the migration included deindustrialisation, high rent, the gentrification of many inner quarters, the transformation of living space into offices, and greater affluence among working families. The city's population loss was one of the most severe among international municipalities and the largest for any that had achieved more than 2,000,000 residents. Since then, an influx of younger residents and immigrants has contributed to the growth of the city.\n\n\n\n\n## Density\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n2019 Census Paris Region (*\u00cele-de-France*)[12][13]\n| Country/territory of birth | Population\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![France](image) Metropolitan France | 9,215,134\n |\n| ![Algeria](image) Algeria | 330,935\n |\n| ![Morocco](image) Morocco | 253,518\n |\n| ![Portugal](image) Portugal | 234,399\n |\n| ![Tunisia](image) Tunisia | 127,827\n |\n| ![](image) Guadeloupe | 81,269\n |\n| ![](image) Martinique | 75,959\n |\n| ![China](image) China | 71,500\n |\n| ![Turkey](image) Turkey | 67,982\n |\n| ![Mali](image) Mali | 66,085\n |\n| ![Ivory Coast](image) C\u00f4te d'Ivoire | 63,810\n |\n| ![Senegal](image) Senegal | 60,124\n |\n| ![Italy](image) Italy | 58,141\n |\n| ![Romania](image) Romania | 53,848\n |\n| ![Democratic Republic of the Congo](image) Democratic Republic of Congo | 52,449\n |\n| ![Spain](image) Spain | 45,828\n |\n| ![Sri Lanka](image) Sri Lanka | 45,786\n |\n| ![Cameroon](image) Cameroon | 45,370\n |\n| ![Republic of the Congo](image) Republic of the Congo | 38,651\n |\n| ![Haiti](image) Haiti | 36,685\n |\n| ![Poland](image) Poland | 35,871\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | 7,384,363\n |  | Fastest population growth in the 20th century. |\n| **1968** | 2,590,771\n | 8,196,746\n | 8,368,000\n | End of postwar baby boom, end of immigration surplus for Paris; henceforth migration flows from the rest of France become negative, population growth is significantly slower. |\n| **1975** | 2,299,830\n | 8,549,898\n | 9,096,000\n |\n| **1982** | 2,176,243\n | 8,706,963\n | 9,362,000\n |  |\n| **1990** | 2,152,423[4] | 9,554,192[38] | 11,031,290[10] |  |\n| **1999** | 2,125,246[4] | 9,738,809[38] | 11,356,877[10] |  |\n| **2007** | 2,193,030[4] | 10,303,282[38] | 12,026,677[10] |  |\n| **2017** | 2,187,526[4] | 10,784,830[38] | 12,628,266[10] |  |\n| Sources:* City proper figures from 1801 on, urban area figures from 1954 on, and metropolitan area figures from 1990 on are official census figures.\n* City proper figures before 1801 and urban area figures before 1954 are estimates from various sources.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n1. **^** Populations l\u00e9gales 2019: 75 Paris, INSEE\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** \"Comparateur de territoire: Aire d'attraction des villes 2020 de Paris (001), Unit\u00e9 urbaine 2020 de Paris (00851), R\u00e9gion \u00cele-de-France (11)\" (in French).

However, without official data, the margin of error of these estimates is extremely high as it is based on one's country of birth (someone born in a Muslim country or born to a parent from a Muslim country is considered as a \"potential Muslim\").[19] According to the North American Jewish Data Bank, an estimated 310,000\u00a0Jews also live in Paris and the surrounding \u00cele-de-France region, an area with a population of 11.7\u00a0million inhabitants. Paris has historically been a magnet for immigrants, hosting one of the largest concentrations of immigrants in Europe today.[20]\n\n\n\n### Immigrants and their children in departments of \u00cele-de-France (Paris Region)\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

This made it Florida's largest city, a title it would retain until the Jacksonville Consolidation, when the city of Jacksonville absorbed most of Duval County, nearly tripling its population.

From 1970 to 2000, population growth in the city was stagnant, as Non-Hispanic White Miamians left and significant immigration from Latin America, particularly Cuba, made up the balance.[13][14] The city's Hispanic majority solidified itself in this period of time, and in 1985, the city elected its first Cuban-born mayor, Xavier Suarez.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the 2000s and 2010s, spurred by high-rise construction in Downtown Miami, Edgewater, and Brickell, Miami's population began to grow quickly once more.[9] An estimate by the American Community Survey found that the downtown population (from Brickell north to Midtown Miami) grew nearly 40% between 2010 and 2018.[10] From 2000 to 2010, the city's population grew by 10.2% and had reached 399,457 by 2010. In the early 2010s, the city's population crossed a milestone of 400,000 people, and by the time of the 2020 census, it had grown by a further 10.7%, up to a population of 442,241.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Non-Hispanic White population began to rebound in the twenty-first century, as the monolithically Hispanic areas in the Western and Central parts of Miami experienced population stagnation. This caused them to begin to be outweighed by migration into the Downtown region (not only from Latin America, but also from the rest of the United States). This caused the Non-Hispanic White population to rise from a nadir of 11.8% at the time of the 2000 census to 11.9% at the time of the 2010 census. After this, the Non-Hispanic White population grew significantly faster than the city as a whole did during the 2010s, and by the time of the 2020 census, Non-Hispanic Whites made up 14.0% of the population of the city and numbered 61,829, the highest number since the 1980s. The Non-Hispanic White population of Miami also surpassed the Non-Hispanic Black population of the city during the 2010s.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** \"P2: HISPANIC OR LATINO, AND NOT ... - Census Bureau Table\". *P2 | HISPANIC OR LATINO, AND NOT HISPANIC OR LATINO BY RACE*.
