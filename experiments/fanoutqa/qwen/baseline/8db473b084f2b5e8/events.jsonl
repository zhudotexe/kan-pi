To be included in the list below, the university must have been founded before 1500 in Europe or be the oldest university derived from the medieval European model in a country or region. It must also be still in operation, with institutional continuity retained throughout its history. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe majority of European countries had universities by 1500. Many universities were established at institutes of learning such as schools and colleges that may have been founded significantly earlier but were not classed as universities upon their foundation; this is normally described in the notes for that institution. In some countries (particularly the US and those influenced by its culture), degree-granting higher education institutions that would normally be called universities are instead called colleges. In this case, both the oldest institution that would normally be regarded as a university and the oldest institution (if different) to actually be called a university are given.

After the death of Casimir the Great in 1370, the development of the university stalled, with lectures being held in various places across the city, including churches and the Wawel cathedral school, and eventually coming to a pause. The faculty of theology was re-opened in 1397 by Queen Jadwiga who left a large endowment to the university upon her death in 1399. The university was formally re-established on 26 July 1400 by King WÅadysÅaw JagieÅÅo. After KrakÃ³w was incorporated into the Austrian Empire, the university was merged with LwÃ³w University from 1805 to 1809. The university was forcibly shut down during the German Occupation of Poland (1939â1945). The staff was deported to German-Nazi concentration camps, and many of its collections were deliberately destroyed by the occupying German authorities. Underground lectures continued for around 800 students during this period and the university formally reopened in 1945.[44] |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n8. **^** Hunt Janin: \"The university in medieval life, 1179â1499\", McFarland, 2008, ISBNÂ 0-7864-3462-7, p. 55f.\n9. **^** RichÃ©, Pierre (1978). *Education and Culture in the Barbarian West: From the Sixth through the Eighth Century*.

There is no indication, however, that up until around 1180, the Bolognese law schools were anything other than private schools opened and run by each master after his own fashion, gathering together the students that had entered into an agreement with him and paid him fees (collectae) in return for his teaching.

They became universities in 1963 and 1961 respectively.\n\n\n\n\n## Medieval origins[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Medieval university\n\nThe university as an institution was historically rooted in medieval society, which it in turn influenced and shaped.

To be included in the list below, the university must have been founded before 1500 in Europe or be the oldest university derived from the medieval European model in a country or region. It must also be still in operation, with institutional continuity retained throughout its history. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe majority of European countries had universities by 1500. Many universities were established at institutes of learning such as schools and colleges that may have been founded significantly earlier but were not classed as universities upon their foundation; this is normally described in the notes for that institution. In some countries (particularly the US and those influenced by its culture), degree-granting higher education institutions that would normally be called universities are instead called colleges. In this case, both the oldest institution that would normally be regarded as a university and the oldest institution (if different) to actually be called a university are given. In many parts of the world, the first university to have a presence was an institution based elsewhere (often the University of London via the affiliation of a local college); where this is different from the first locally established university, both are given.\n\n\n\n### Africa[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n118. **^** \"A significant history\".

The university was forcibly shut down during the German Occupation of Poland (1939â1945). The staff was deported to German-Nazi concentration camps, and many of its collections were deliberately destroyed by the occupying German authorities. Underground lectures continued for around 800 students during this period and the university formally reopened in 1945.[44] |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n8. **^** Hunt Janin: \"The university in medieval life, 1179â1499\", McFarland, 2008, ISBNÂ 0-7864-3462-7, p. 55f.\n9. **^** RichÃ©, Pierre (1978). *Education and Culture in the Barbarian West: From the Sixth through the Eighth Century*.

There is no indication, however, that up until around 1180, the Bolognese law schools were anything other than private schools opened and run by each master after his own fashion, gathering together the students that had entered into an agreement with him and paid him fees (collectae) in return for his teaching. The crucial change would seem to have taken place around the years 1180â90. ... The masters, who were themselves mainly Bolognese in origin, agreed from 1189 to swear an oath to the commune not to seek to transfer the *studium* elsewhere.

Thereafter, evidence confirming that Bologna had become a *universitas* and announcing similar developments elsewhere proliferate.

The University of Bologna in Bologna, Italy, where teaching began around 1088 and which was organised into a university in the late twelfth century, is the world's oldest university in continuous operation,[1] and the first university in the sense of a higher-learning and degree-awarding institute.[7][8][1] The origin of many medieval universities can be traced back to the Catholic cathedral schools or monastic schools, which appeared as early as the sixth century and were run for hundreds of years as such before their formal establishment as universities in the high medieval period.[9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | Law schools existed in Bologna from the second half of the 12th century, with 1088 often considered to be the date on which teaching outside of ecclesiastical schools began.[16] In 1158, petitions by Bolognese doctors of law led to Emperor Barbarossa granting the \"Authentic *Habita*\", which granted various rights to students and masters but did not name Bologna or any other particular place of study.[17] However, it is unlikely that the university had become organised by the 1150s, and this may have been as late as the 1180s.[18] The law schools appear to have remained independent, private entities until around 1180, but became organised over the following decade.
