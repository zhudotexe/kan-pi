The Working Group on California Earthquake Probabilities estimated a minimum 27 percent chance of a magnitude 6.7 or greater earthquake on this segment by 2037.[24]\n\n\nOn November 21, 2005, the United States Geological Survey released a map detailing the results of a new tool that measures ground shaking during an earthquake. The map determined that the 1906 San Francisco earthquake was most powerful in an area between Santa Rosa and what is now Sebastopol, causing more damage in Santa Rosa (for its size) than any other city affected.[25]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nMunicipalities and communities of Sonoma County, California, United States\n |\n| --- |\n| County seat: **Santa Rosa**\n |\n| Cities and towns | * Cloverdale\n* Cotati\n* Healdsburg\n* Petaluma\n* Rohnert Park\n* Santa Rosa\n* Sebastopol\n* Sonoma\n* Windsor\n | ![](image)Sonoma County map\n |\n| CDPs | * Bloomfield\n* Bodega\n* Bodega Bay\n* Boyes Hot Springs\n* Carmet\n* Cazadero\n* El Verano\n* Eldridge\n* Fetters Hot Springs-Agua Caliente\n* Forestville\n* Fulton\n* Geyserville\n* Glen Ellen\n* Graton\n* Guerneville\n* Jenner\n* Kenwood\n* Larkfield-Wikiup\n* Monte Rio\n* Occidental\n* Penngrove\n* Petaluma Center\n* Roseland\n* Salmon Creek\n* Sea Ranch\n* Sereno del Mar\n* Sonoma State University\n* Temelec\n* Timber Cove\n* Valley Ford\n |\n| Unincorporatedcommunities | * Annapolis\n* Asti\n* Camp Meeker\n* Duncans Mills\n* Fort Ross\n* Freestone\n* Guernewood Park\n* Hacienda\n* Kellogg\n* Korbel\n* Lakeville\n* Lytton\n* Mark West\n* Mark West Springs\n* Preston\n* Rio Nido\n* Schellville\n* Stewarts Point\n* Two Rock\n* Venado\n* Villa Grande\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Millbrae\n* Moraga\n* Orinda\n* Piedmont\n* Pinole\n* Rio Vista\n* San Anselmo\n* Sonoma\n |\n| Under 10k | * Atherton\n* Belvedere\n* Brisbane\n* Calistoga\n* Cloverdale\n* Colma\n* Cotati\n* Fairfax\n* Los Altos Hills\n* Monte Sereno\n* Portola Valley\n* Ross\n* St. Helena\n* Sausalito\n* Sebastopol\n* Tiburon\n* Woodside\n* Yountville\n |\n\n |\n| CDPsover 10k | * Alamo\n* Alum Rock\n* Ashland\n* Bay Point\n* Castro Valley\n* Cherryland\n* Discovery Bay\n* El Sobrante\n* Fairview\n* North Fair Oaks\n* San Lorenzo\n* Stanford\n* Tamalpais-Homestead Valley\n |\n| Sub-regions | * East Bay\n* North Bay\n* San Francisco Peninsula\n* Santa Clara Valley\n |\n| Other | * Homelessness\n* Politics\n* Sports\n* Transportation\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n72. **^** \"Sonoma County Gazette\". *About Us*.

The epicenters were about two miles (3.2\u00a0km) north of Santa Rosa.\n\n\n\n### Nature and wildlife\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nRailroad Square is the portion of downtown that is on the west side of U.S. Route 101 and has the highest concentration of historic commercial buildings. Of particular note are the four rough-hewn stone buildings at its core, two of which are rare in that they predate the 1906 earthquake. They include the old Northwestern Pacific Railroad depot, prominently seen in the beginning and the end of the Alfred Hitchcock film *Shadow of a Doubt*, and the still-functioning Hotel La Rose, built in 1907 and registered as one of the National Trust for Historic Preservation's Historic Hotels of America. The area contains numerous other historic buildings, such as the former Petaluma and Santa Rosa Railroad depot, and the Lee Bros. Building, both at the corner of 4th and Wilson Streets. Near it in the West End district are numerous other old buildings, including not only many old houses but the masonry DeTurk Winery complex, dating to the 1880s\u20131890s, and the DeTurk round barn. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSanta Rosa has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen *Csb*) with cool, wet winters and warm, dry summers. In the summer, fog and low overcast often move in from the Pacific Ocean during the evenings and mornings. They usually clear up to warm, sunny weather by late morning or noon before returning in the later evening but will occasionally linger all day. Average annual rainfall is 32.20 inches (818\u00a0mm), falling on 74 days annually. The wettest year was 1983 with 63.07 inches (1,602\u00a0mm) and the driest year was 1976 with 11.38 inches (289\u00a0mm). The most rainfall in one month was 19.42 inches (493\u00a0mm) in February 1998 and the most rainfall in 24 hours was 5.23 inches (133\u00a0mm) on December 19, 1981. Measurable snowfall is rare in the lowlands, but light amounts sometimes fall in the nearby mountains.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBy the 1850s, after the United States annexed California following its victory in the Mexican-American War, a Wells Fargo post and general store were established in what is now downtown Santa Rosa. In the mid-1850s, several prominent locals, including Julio Carrillo, son of Maria Carrillo, laid out the grid street pattern for Santa Rosa with a public square in the center. This pattern has been largely maintained in downtown to this day, despite changes to the central square, now called Old Courthouse Square.\n\n\nIn 1867, the county recognized Santa Rosa as an incorporated city; in 1868, the state officially confirmed the incorporation, making it the third incorporated city in Sonoma County after Petaluma, incorporated in 1858, and Healdsburg, incorporated in 1867.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDirector Alfred Hitchcock filmed his thriller *Shadow of a Doubt* in Santa Rosa in 1943; the film gives glimpses of Santa Rosa in the 1940s. Many of the downtown buildings seen in the film no longer exist, as there was major reconstruction in the late 20th century following the strong earthquakes in October 1969. But the rough-stone Northwestern Pacific Railroad depot and the prominent Empire Building (built in 1910 with a gold-topped clock tower) still survive. A scene at the bank was filmed at the corner of Fourth Street and Mendocino Avenue (at present-day Old Courthouse square); the Kress building on Fourth Street is also visible. The courthouse and bank are now gone. The Coen brothers' film *The Man Who Wasn't There* (2001) is set in Santa Rosa c.\u20091949.\n\n\n\n## Film locations\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Film locations in Sonoma County, California\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | 38.4(3.6)\n | 40.0(4.4)\n | 41.9(5.5)\n | 43.9(6.6)\n | 47.8(8.8)\n | 51.1(10.6)\n | 52.1(11.2)\n | 52.5(11.4)\n | 51.0(10.6)\n | 47.6(8.7)\n | 42.0(5.6)\n | 38.2(3.4)\n | 45.5(7.5)\n |\n| Mean minimum \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n | 29.4(\u22121.4)\n | 31.2(\u22120.4)\n | 34.0(1.1)\n | 36.8(2.7)\n | 42.1(5.6)\n | 45.3(7.4)\n | 48.2(9.0)\n | 48.0(8.9)\n | 45.6(7.6)\n | 39.8(4.3)\n | 32.3(0.2)\n | 29.4(\u22121.4)\n | 27.2(\u22122.7)\n |\n| Record low \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n | 15(\u22129)\n | 20(\u22127)\n | 24(\u22124)\n | 26(\u22123)\n | 27(\u22123)\n | 30(\u22121)\n | 39(4)\n | 34(1)\n | 30(\u22121)\n | 24(\u22124)\n | 21(\u22126)\n | 9(\u221213)\n | 9(\u221213)\n |\n| Average rainfall inches (mm)\n | 5.78(147)\n | 6.39(162)\n | 4.26(108)\n | 1.98(50)\n | 1.28(33)\n | 0.29(7.4)\n | 0.01(0.25)\n | 0.04(1.0)\n | 0.15(3.8)\n | 1.63(41)\n | 3.25(83)\n | 6.47(164)\n | 31.53(801)\n |\n| Average rainy days (\u2265 0.01 in) | 11.8\n | 10.4\n | 9.8\n | 7.1\n | 3.4\n | 1.2\n | 0.3\n | 0.6\n | 1.0\n | 3.3\n | 7.3\n | 10.5\n | 66.7\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 81\n | 77\n | 71\n | 66\n | 62\n | 58\n | 60\n | 60\n | 60\n | 63\n | 73\n | 81\n | 68\n |\n| Average dew point \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n | 42(6)\n | 43(6)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe 1906 San Francisco earthquake essentially destroyed the entire downtown, but the city's population did not greatly suffer. However, after that period the population growth of Santa Rosa, as with most of the area, was very slow.\n\n\nSanta Rosa grew following World War II because it was the location for Naval Auxiliary Landing Field Santa Rosa, the remnants of which are now located in southwest Santa Rosa. The city was a convenient location for San Francisco travelers bound for the Russian River.\n\n\nThe population increased by two-thirds between 1950 and 1970, an average of 1,000 new residents a year over the 20-year period. Some of the increase was from immigration, and some from annexation of portions of the surrounding area.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n## Arts and culture\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)\nPanoramic view of Old Courthouse Square\n\n### Libraries\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Sonoma County Library offers a Central Library in downtown Santa Rosa, a Roseland branch on Sebastopol Road, a Northwest branch at Coddingtown Mall, and a Rincon Valley branch in east Santa Rosa. It is a member of the North Bay Cooperative Library System. The Santa Rosa Central Library, the largest branch of the Sonoma County Library system, has a Local History and Genealogy Annex behind it.[53]\n\n\nThe Sonoma County Public Law Library[54] is at the Sonoma County Courthouse.\n\n\nAt Santa Rosa Junior College, the four-story Frank P. Doyle Library[55] houses the Library, Media Services, and Academic Computing Departments, as well as the college art gallery, tutorial center and Center for New Media, a multimedia production facility for SRJC faculty.\n\n\n\n### Tourism\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDowntown Santa Rosa, including the central Old Courthouse Square and historic Railroad Square, is an area of shopping, restaurants, nightclubs, and theaters. Downtown also includes City Hall, state and federal office buildings, many banks, and professional offices. The Santa Rosa Memorial Hospital medical center is just to the east of downtown.\n\n\nAlthough there are co-op network atms and several credit unions, there is no shared branching for credit unions in Santa Rosa.[57]\n\n\nThe city council funds a private booster group, Santa Rosa Main Street, which lobbies the city to revitalize the traditional business district. Three new mixed-use, high-rise buildings, and a new city parking garage, are under development. (WHEN?) The council and downtown business boosters hope condos atop the new buildings will house a population to keep the area active 24 hours a day.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The historic Fountaingrove Round Barn, previously found at the southwestern base of Fountaingrove, was lost to fire in 2017.\nBeginning on the night of October 8, 2017, five percent of the city's homes were destroyed in the Tubbs Fire, a 45,000-acre wildfire that claimed the lives of at least 19 people in Sonoma County.[14] Named after its origin near Tubbs Lane and Highway 128 in adjacent Napa County, the fire became a major section of the most destructive and third deadliest firestorm in California history.[15][16][17] Most homes in the Coffey Park, Larkfield-Wikiup, and Fountain Grove neighborhoods were destroyed.\n\n\nA notable exception to the destruction in the area was the protection of more than 1,000 animals at the renowned Safari West Wildlife Preserve northeast of Santa Rosa. All of the preserve's animals were saved by owner Peter Lang. At age 76, he single-handedly and successfully fought back the flames for more than 10 hours using garden hoses.[18][19]\n\n\n\n## Geography\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n2021 and especially its late spring and summer saw an increase in shootings, violence, homicides, drug, gang, and homeless-related crimes. The increase was up to double for some crimes and problems, compared to the past several years.[45]\n\n\n\n### Homelessness\n\n[edit]\n\nThere are at least 2,700 homeless people in Sonoma County. Around 1,500 are in Santa Rosa, about one percent of the city. Downtown Santa Rosa, including its outskirts and the area south of the Santa Rosa Mall (Wilson and Morgan Street) and Mendocino Avenue area, South Park/Fairgrounds area, Santa Rosa Avenue, West Steele Lane, and the Joe Rodota Trail/Stony Point districts and neighborhoods have been concentrations of homeless people since the 2000s. Homeless services can be found in the Wilson Street area.[46]\n\n\n\n## Economy\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Bellevue Union\n* Bennett Valley Union\n* Mark West Union\n* Oak Grove Union\n* Piner-Olivet Union\n* Rincon Valley Union\n* Roseland Public Schools\n* Santa Rosa City Schools\n* Wright Union School District\n\n\n### Private schools\n\n[edit]\n\n* Cardinal Newman High School (9\u201312)\n* Redwood Adventist Academy (K-12)\n* Rincon Valley Christian School (K-12)\n* Sonoma Academy (9\u201312)\n* St. Eugene's cathedral school\n* St. Luke's Elementary School\n* St. Rose Elementary School\n* Sonoma Country Day School (K-8)\n* Summerfield Waldorf School & Farm (K-12)\n* Stuart School (K-8)\n\n\n### Colleges\n\n[edit]\n\n* Empire College\n* Santa Rosa Junior College\n* University of San Francisco (USF) \u2013 Santa Rosa\n\n\n## Media\n\n[edit]\n\n### Print\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Airplane hangar used in the film *It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World*\n![](image)McDonald Mansion in Santa Rosa, whose exterior appears in *Pollyanna*\nSanta Rosa has served as a location for many major films,[85] including:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Mar\u00eda Ygnacia L\u00f3pez de Carrillo, a Californio ranchera and founder of Santa Rosa\n![](image)The former Petaluma and Santa Rosa Railroad station\n![](image)Panoramic map of Santa Rosa in 1871\n![](image)The Empire Building at Old Courthouse Square in downtown Santa Rosa\nBefore the arrival of Europeans, what became known as the Santa Rosa Plain was home to a strong and populous tribe of Pomo people known as the Bitakomtara. The Bitakomtara controlled the area closely, barring passage to others until permission was arranged. Those who entered without permission were subject to harsh penalties. The tribe gathered at ceremonial times on Santa Rosa Creek near present-day Spring Lake Regional Park.\n\n\nFollowing the arrival of Europeans, initially Spanish explorers and colonists, the Pomos were decimated by violence, land theft, slavery, genocide and smallpox brought from Europe. Social displacement and disruption followed. \n\n\n\n### 19th century\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n*The Press Democrat* is published in Santa Rosa and is the largest daily newspaper in the North Bay. It is descended from the *Sonoma Democrat*, founded in 1857.[68] Local business papers include the *North Bay Business Journal*[69] and *NorthBay biz*.[70] *The* *North Bay Bohemian* is a free weekly alternative.[71] The *Sonoma County Gazette* is a free monthly paper.[72]\n\n\nSonoma Media Investments is a significant regional presence: besides the *Press Democrat* and the *North Bay Business Journal* as well as the *Sonoma County Gazette*, it owns important newspapers in the nearby cities of Sonoma and Petaluma.[73]\n\n\n\n## Infrastructure\n\n[edit]\n\n### Law enforcement\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Santa Rosa Police Department currently has 259 employees, of which 172 are sworn peace officers. Its budget is more than $40 million, comprising more than one third of the city's General Fund budget. Police shootings in 2007 led to calls for an independent civilian police review board.[74]\n\n\n\n### Fire department\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nCharles M. Schulz\u2013Sonoma County Airport located just north of Santa Rosa is served by United, American, Alaska, and Avelo Airlines. Nonstop flights are available to San Francisco, Los Angeles, Burbank, San Diego, Santa Ana, Portland, Seattle, Las Vegas, Denver, Dallas, and Phoenix. Sonoma County Airport Express buses also connect Santa Rosa with Oakland International Airport and San Francisco International Airport.[82]\n\n\n\n#### Motor-minimal travel\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Prince Memorial Greenway is a developed bicycle and pedestrian path along Santa Rosa Creek through downtown and out to the west of town. Near Railroad Square, it connects directly to the Joe Rodota Trail, a paved path which goes to Sebastopol.[83] Santa Rosa is on the path of the partially-developed Great Redwood Trail which will run \"from San Francisco Bay in Marin County to Humboldt Bay in the north.\"[84]\n\n\n\n## Notable people\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: List of people from Santa Rosa, California\n\n## Representation in other media\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nUnited States Census Bureau records show that after California became a state, Santa Rosa grew steadily, though it lagged behind nearby Petaluma in the 1850s and early 1860s. In the 1870 census, Santa Rosa was the eighth-largest city in California, and county seat of one of the most populous counties in the state. Growth and development after that was steady but never rapid. The city continued to grow when other early population centers declined or stagnated, but by 1900 it was being overtaken by many other newer population centers in the San Francisco Bay Area and Southern California.\n\n\n\n### 20th century\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)The Empire Building, completed in 1910 and a Sonoma County landmark, seen in the film *Shadow of a Doubt* by Alfred Hitchcock, in December 2021\nBy 1900, the Pomo population had decreased by 95%.[11]\n\n\nAccording to a 1905 article in the *Press Democrat* reporting on the \"Battle of the Trains\", the city had just over 10,000 people at the time.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* *Smooth Talk* (1985) \u2013 locations include Santa Rosa shopping malls and Sebastopol.\n* *Peggy Sue Got Married* (1986) \u2013 locations include Santa Rosa High School and Petaluma.\n* *Wildfire* (1988) \u2013 includes Wood Pontiac & Cadillac on Corby Avenue.\n* *Wired* (1989) \u2013 filmed in Santa Rosa.\n* *Die Hard 2* (1990) \u2013 scenes shot at Santa Rosa Air Center.\n* *Stop!
