He later apologised on Twitter and announced he was taking a break from social media. The video has since been removed.[33] He then visited the Al-Hikam Institute, a mosque in Bradford, to \"educate himself\" and where he apologised again for the hurt and disappointment he had caused.[34]\n\n\nIn September 2023, *Forbes* ranked KSI as the second top creator of 2023, earning an estimated $24 million.[35]\n\n\n\n## Music career[edit]\n\n\n### 2015–2016: Early releases[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n12. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** Warwick, Josh (16 October 2014). \"Meet the 21-year-old YouTuber who made millions playing video games\". *The Telegraph*.
