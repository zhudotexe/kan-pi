The Astros defeated Boston 3–2 on September 29 for their 100th win of the season, their first 100-win season since 1998. Overall, the Astros finished with a 101–61 regular season record, their second-highest win total in franchise history, for a .623 winning percentage.\nJust four days after the end of the regular season, the Astros met the Red Sox at home in the AL Division Series (ALDS), and defeated them in four games. Houston then advanced to the AL Championship Series (ALCS) and defeated the New York Yankees in seven games for their first American League pennant. Combined with their NL pennant in 2005, the Astros became the first MLB team to make it to the World Series as members of both the National and American Leagues.

The Astros defeated Boston 3–2 on September 29 for their 100th win of the season, their first 100-win season since 1998. Overall, the Astros finished with a 101–61 regular season record, their second-highest win total in franchise history, for a .623 winning percentage.\nJust four days after the end of the regular season, the Astros met the Red Sox at home in the AL Division Series (ALDS), and defeated them in four games. Houston then advanced to the AL Championship Series (ALCS) and defeated the New York Yankees in seven games for their first American League pennant. Combined with their NL pennant in 2005, the Astros became the first MLB team to make it to the World Series as members of both the National and American Leagues. Finally, the Astros faced and defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 2017 World Series 4 games to 3.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nAmerican League West champions\n |\n| --- |\n| 1960s | * 1969: Minnesota Twins\n |\n| 1970s | * 1970: Minnesota Twins\n* 1971: Oakland Athletics\n* 1972: Oakland Athletics\n* 1973: Oakland Athletics\n* 1974: Oakland Athletics\n* 1975: Oakland Athletics\n* 1976: Kansas City Royals\n* 1977: Kansas City Royals\n* 1978: Kansas City Royals\n* 1979: California Angels\n |\n| 1980s | * 1980: Kansas City Royals\n* 1981: Oakland Athletics\n* 1982: California Angels\n* 1983: Chicago White Sox\n* 1984: Kansas City Royals\n* 1985: Kansas City Royals\n* 1986: California Angels\n* 1987: Minnesota Twins\n* 1988: Oakland Athletics\n* 1989: Oakland Athletics\n |\n| 1990s | * 1990: Oakland Athletics\n* 1991: Minnesota Twins\n* 1992: Oakland Athletics\n* 1993: Chicago White Sox\n* 1994: *No champion*\n* 1995: Seattle Mariners\n* 1996: Texas Rangers\n* 1997: Seattle Mariners\n* 1998: Texas Rangers\n* 1999: Texas Rangers\n |\n| 2000s | * 2000: Oakland Athletics\n* 2001: Seattle Mariners\n* 2002: Oakland Athletics\n* 2003: Oakland Athletics\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMajor League Baseball team season\n\n\n\n| 2017 Houston Astros |\n| --- |\n| World Series championsAmerican League champions  American League West champions |\n| League | American League |\n| Division | AL West Division |\n| Ballpark | Minute Maid Park |\n| City | Houston, Texas |\n| Record | 101–61 (.623) |\n| Divisional place | 1st |\n| Owners | Jim Crane |\n| General managers | Jeff Luhnow |\n| Managers | A.

The Astros fell behind by scores of 4–0, 7–4, and 8–7, but hit a game-tying home run to reduce each deficit. They eventually led 12–9 in the ninth inning, but the Dodgers made their own comeback to tie the game at 12 with a home run from Puig and an RBI single from Chris Taylor. In the bottom of the 10th, Alex Bregman singled to left field off Dodgers closer Kenley Jansen to score pinch runner Derek Fisher for the walk-off hit. That single concluded the second-longest game in World Series history, running at five hours, 17 minutes.

The offense was led by AL batting champion and second baseman José Altuve (.346) who won a number of distinctions, including Most Valuable Player (AL MVP), *Sports Illustrated* Sportsperson of the Year, and Associated Press Male Athlete of the Year. He became just the second Astro to win the MVP following Jeff Bagwell in 1994. The ALCS MVP was starting pitcher Justin Verlander, and the World Series MVP was center fielder George Springer.\n\n\nBecause of its record-setting numbers and individual accolades, this Astros batting lineup is often cited as one of the highest-performing in history.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 151 | September 20 | White Sox | 4–3 | **Peacock** (12–2) | Shields (4–7) | **Musgrove** (2) | 24,995 | 93–58 | W6\n |\n| 152 | September 21 | White Sox | 1–3 | Volstad (1–0) | **Keuchel** (13–5) | Minaya (5) | 24,283 | 93–59 | L1\n |\n| 153 | September 22 | Angels | 3–0 | **Verlander** (14–8) | Petit (5–2) | **Giles** (33) | 34,127 | 94–59 | W1\n |\n| 154 | September 23 | Angels | 6–2 | **Morton** (13–7) | Norris (2–6) | — | 34,035 | 95–59 | W2\n |\n| 155 | September 24 | Angels | 5–7 | Middleton (6–1) | **Devenski** (8–5) | Parker (7) | 36,756 | 95–60 | L1\n |\n| 156 | September 25 | @ Rangers | 11–2 | **McHugh** (4–2) | Cashner (10–11) | — | 30,390 | 96–60 | W1\n |\n| 157 | September 26 | @ Rangers | 14–3 | **Keuchel** (14–5) | Hamels (11–5) | — | 28,976 | 97–60 | W2\n |\n| 158 | September 27 | @ Rangers | 12–2 | **Verlander** (15–8) | Martinez (3–8) | — | 26,053 | 98–60 | W3\n |\n| 159 | September 28 | @ Red Sox | 12–2 | **Peacock** (13–2) | Rodriguez (6–7) | — | 34,222 | 99–60 | W4\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Houston Astros award winners**\n| Name of award\n | Recipient\n | Ref |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| American League Championship Series Most Valuable Player (ALCS MVP)\n | Justin Verlander | [37] |\n| American League Most Valuable Player (AL MVP)\n | José Altuve\n | [52] |\n| American League Pitcher of the Month | April\n | Dallas Keuchel\n | [7] |\n| May\n | Lance McCullers Jr.\n | [8] |\n| American League Player of the Month | May\n | Carlos Correa\n | [8] |\n| July\n | José Altuve\n | [19] |\n| American League Rookie of the Month | July\n | Yuli Gurriel | [19] |\n| Associated Press Male Athlete of the Year | José Altuve\n | [53] |\n| Babe Ruth Award | José Altuve\n | [47] |\n| Justin Verlander\n |\n| *Baseball America* Major League Player of the Year | José Altuve\n | [54] |\n| Fred Hartman Long and Meritorious Service to Baseball\n | Bob Watson | [55] |\n| Hank Aaron Award | José Altuve\n | [56] |\n| Houston-Area (non-Astros) Player of the Year\n | Paul Goldschmidt | [55] |\n| Houston Astros Most Valuable Player (MVP)\n | José Altuve\n | [55] |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | 1\n | .000\n | .000\n | .000\n | 0\n |\n| **Michael Feliz** | 46\n | 1\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | 1\n | .000\n | .000\n | .000\n | 0\n |\n| Mike Fiers | 30\n | 1\n | 1\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | 1\n | .000\n | .000\n | .000\n | 0\n |\n| Derek Fisher | 53\n | 146\n | 21\n | 31\n | 4\n | 1\n | 5\n | 17\n | 3\n | 17\n | 54\n | .212\n | .307\n | .356\n | 52\n |\n| Evan Gattis | 84\n | 300\n | 41\n | 79\n | 22\n | 0\n | 12\n | 55\n | 0\n | 18\n | 50\n | .263\n | .311\n | .457\n | 137\n |\n| **Marwin González** | 134\n | 455\n | 67\n | 138\n | 34\n | 0\n | 23\n | 90\n | 8\n | 49\n | 99\n | .303\n | .377\n | .530\n | 241\n |\n| **Yulieski Gurriel** | 139\n | 529\n | 69\n | 158\n | 43\n | 1\n | 18\n | 75\n | 3\n | 22\n | 62\n | .299\n | .332\n | .486\n | 257\n |\n| **Teoscar Hernández** | 1\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | —\n | —\n | —\n | —\n |\n| James Hoyt | 3\n | 1\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | 1\n | .000\n | .000\n | .000\n | 0\n |\n| **Tony Kemp** | 17\n | 37\n | 6\n | 8\n | 1\n | 0\n | 0\n | 4\n | 1\n | 1\n | 5\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHaving achieve 200 hits on the season, Altuve became just the fifth hitter since integration in 1947 to record four straight 200-hit seasons, following Wade Boggs (1983−89), Kirby Puckett (1986−89), Ichiro Suzuki (2001−2010), and Michael Young (2003−07).[29] He also became the first hitter in Major League history to solely lead his respective league in hits for four years in a row while also collecting his third career batting title. Suzuki technically led the AL in hits from 2006 to 2010, but tied with Dustin Pedroia in 2008.[30]\n\n\n\n### Season standings\n\n[edit]\n\n#### American League West\n\n[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn Game 2, Springer, Correa, Altuve—and two Dodgers players–Charlie Culberson and Yasiel Puig—all homered in extra innings as the Astros prevailed, 7−6.
