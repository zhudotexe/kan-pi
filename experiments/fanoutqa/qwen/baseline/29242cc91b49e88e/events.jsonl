For simplification and to avoid errors, each award in this list has been presumed to have had a prior nomination.\n |\n\n\nAmerican actor and producer Robert Downey Jr. has received numerous accolades throughout his career including an BAFTA Award, three Golden Globe Awards, and a Screen Actors Guild Award.

For simplification and to avoid errors, each award in this list has been presumed to have had a prior nomination.\n |\n\n\nAmerican actor and producer Robert Downey Jr. has received numerous accolades throughout his career including an BAFTA Award, three Golden Globe Awards, and a Screen Actors Guild Award. He has also received nominations for two Academy Awards and a Primetime Emmy Award. \n\n\nFor his role as Charlie Chaplin in the Richard Attenborough directed biographical epic *Chaplin* (1991) he received the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role as well as nominations for the Academy Award for Best Actor and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Drama. For his comedic role in Ben Stiller's satirical war comedy *Tropic Thunder* (2008) he received his second Academy Award nomination, this time for the Best Supporting Actor as well as nominations for the BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actor and the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor. \n\n\nDowney Jr. portrayed Larry Paul in the Fox legal drama *Ally McBeal* from 2000 to 2002. For his performance he earned the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Series, Miniseries or Television Film and the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Comedy Series as well as a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series.\n\n\n\n## Awards and nominations[edit]\n\n\nAwards and nominations\n\n* A\n*
