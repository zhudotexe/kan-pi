London School of Economics\n4. University of St Andrews\n5. University of Bath\n\nLet me look up the establishment years of these universities.\nThe University of Cambridge, one of the top universities in the UK, is the second-best university in the world according to QS Rankings. It is also ranked as the best university in Europe. The university is routinely ranked among the world's top five universities and has sometimes been ranked as the world's best. The University of Cambridge was established in the early years and has a rich history of academic excellence and research output.\n\nNow, let me look up the establishment year of the University of Oxford.\nThe University of Oxford, one of the oldest and most prestigious universities in the world, was established in the early years and has a rich history of academic excellence and research output. The university is regularly ranked within the top five universities globally and is currently ranked first in the Times Higher Education World University Rankings. It is also ranked first in the UK for forming CEOs and for the quality of its graduates as chosen by major UK companies.\n\nThe University of Oxford has a long history of notable alumni, including 30 prime ministers of the United Kingdom and many heads of state and government worldwide. As of October 2022, the university has produced 73 Nobel Prize laureates, 4 Fields Medalists, and 6 Turing Award winners. The university has a total consolidated income of \u00a32.78 billion, with a significant portion coming from research grants and contracts.\n\nOxford is a member of various prestigious affiliations, including the Russell Group, the G5, the League of European Research Universities, and the International Alliance of Research Universities. It is also part of the Europaeum and forms part of the \"golden triangle\" of highly research-intensive and elite English universities.\n\nThe University of Oxford has a strong academic profile and a rigorous admission process. Prospective undergraduate students apply through the UCAS application system, with an earlier deadline of 15 October for Oxford and Cambridge applicants, as well as for medicine, dentistry, and veterinary science courses. The university has been working to increase the proportion of students from state schools and underrepresented demographics through outreach programs and initiatives.\n\nIn terms of admission statistics, the university received over 23,000 applications in 2022, with an offer rate of 15.3%. The student body composition includes a mix of British White students, British Ethnic Minorities, International EU students, and International Non-EU students. The university has been making efforts to improve diversity and widen participation among its student body.\n\nOverall, the University of Oxford continues to uphold its reputation as a world-class institution with a commitment to academic excellence and research innovation.",

          "content": "<document>\n<title>Rankings of universities in the United Kingdom</title>\n<content>\nOrganization\n\n\n\n\nThree national **rankings of universities in the United Kingdom**  are published annually, by *The Complete University Guide*, *The Guardian* and jointly by *The Times* and *The Sunday Times*. Rankings have also been produced in the past by *The Daily Telegraph* and *Financial Times*. UK Universities also rank highly in global university rankings with 8 UK Universities ranking in the top 100 of the three major global rankings: *QS World University Rankings*, *Times Higher Education World University Rankings* and *Academic Ranking of World Universities*.\n\n\nThe primary aim of the rankings is to inform potential undergraduate applicants about UK universities based on a range of criteria, including entry standards, student satisfaction, staff/student ratio, academic services and facilities expenditure per student, research quality, proportion of Firsts and 2:1s, completion rates and student destinations.[1][2] All of the league tables also rank universities on their strength in individual subjects.\n\n\nEach year since 2008, *Times Higher Education* has compiled a \"Table of Tables\" to combine the results of the 3 mainstream league tables. In the 2022 table, the top 5 universities were the University of Oxford, the University of Cambridge, the University of St Andrews, the London School of Economics and Imperial College.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## Rankings[edit]\n\n\nThe following rankings of British universities are produced annually:\n\n\n\n### *The Complete University Guide*[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Top 40 universities based on the CUG's aggregated results over the past 10 years\n*The Complete University Guide* is compiled by Mayfield University Consultants and was published for the first time in 2007.[4]\n\n\nThe ranking uses ten criteria, with a statistical technique called the Z-score applied to the results of each.[5] The ten Z-scores are then weighted (as given below) and summed to give a total score for each university. These total scores are then transformed to a scale where the top score is set at 1,000, with the remainder being a proportion of the top score. The ten criteria are:[6]\n\n\n\n* \"Academic services spend\" (weight 0.5) \u2013 the expenditure per student on all academic services (data source: Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA));\n* \"Degree completion\" (weight 1.0) \u2013 a measure of the completion rate of students (data source: HESA);\n* \"Entry standards\" (weight 1.0) \u2013 the average UCAS tariff score of new students under the age of 21 (data source: HESA);\n* \"Facilities spend\" (weight 0.5) \u2013 the expenditure per student on staff and student facilities (data source: HESA);\n* \"Good honours\" (weight 1.0) \u2013 the proportion of firsts and upper seconds (data source: HESA);(now phased out)\n* \"Graduate prospects\" (weight 1.0) \u2013 a measure of the employability of graduates (data source: HESA);\n* \"Research quality\" (weight 1.0) \u2013 a measure of the average quality of research (data source: 2021 Research Excellence Framework (REF));\n* Research intensity\" (weight 0.5) \u2013 a measure of the fraction of staff who are research-active (data sources: HESA & REF);\n* \"Student satisfaction\" (weight 1.5) \u2013 a measure of the view of students on the teaching quality (data source: the National Student Survey); and\n* \"Student\u2013staff ratio\" (weight 1.0) \u2013 a measure of the average staffing level (data source: HESA).\n\n\nThe most recent league table (2024) ranked the top 40 (out of 130) British universities as follows:[7]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Rank (1\u201310) | University | Rank (11\u201320) | University | Rank (21\u201330) | University | Rank (31\u201340) | University\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | University of Cambridge | 11 | University of Warwick | 21 | Cardiff University | 31 | University of Strathclyde |\n| 2 | University of Oxford | 12 | University of Edinburgh | 22 | University of Leeds | 32 | University of Essex |\n| 3 | London School of Economics | 13 | University of Surrey | 23 | University of East Anglia | 33 | Harper Adams University |\n| 4 | University of St Andrews | 14 | University of Birmingham | 24= | King's College London | 34 | University of Reading |\n| 5 | University of Bath | 15 | University of Exeter | 24= | University of Liverpool | 35 | University of Aberdeen |\n| 6 | Imperial College London | 16 | University of Bristol | 26 | University of Glasgow | 36 | Northumbria University |\n| 7 | Loughborough University | 17= | University of York | 27 | Queen's University Belfast | 37 | Royal Holloway, University of London |\n| 8 | Durham University | 17= | University of Southampton | 28 | University of Nottingham | 38 | University of Leicester |\n| 9 | University College London | 19 | University of Manchester | 29 | University of the Arts London | 39 | Aberystwyth University |\n| 10 | Lancaster University | 20 | University of Sheffield | 30 | Newcastle University | 40 | Swansea University |\n\n\n### *The Guardian*[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Top 40 universities based on The Guardian's aggregated results over the past 10 years\n*The Guardian*'s ranking uses nine different criteria, each weighted between 5 and 15 per cent. Unlike other annual rankings of British universities, the criteria do not include a measure of research output.[8] A \"value-added\" factor is included which compares students' degree results with their entry qualifications, described by the newspaper as being \"[b]ased upon a sophisticated indexing methodology that tracks students from enrolment to graduation, qualifications upon entry are compared with the award that a student receives at the end of their studies\".[1] Tables are drawn up for subjects, with the overall ranking being based on an average across the subjects rather than on institutional level statistics. The nine criteria are:[9]\n\n\n\n* \"Entry scores\" (15%);\n* \"Assessment and feedback\" (10%) \u2013 as rated by graduates of the course (data source: National Student Survey);\n* \"Career prospects\" (15%) (data source: Destination of Leavers from Higher Education);\n* \"Overall satisfaction\" (5%) \u2013 final-year students opinions about the overall quality of their course (data source: National Student Survey);\n* \"Expenditure per student\" (5%);\n* \"Student-staff ratio\" (15%);\n* \"Teaching\" (10%) \u2013 as rated by graduates of the course (data source: the National Student Survey);\n* \"Value added\" (15%);\n* \"Continuation\" (10%).\n\n\nThe most recent league table (2024) ranked the top 40 (out of 122) British universities as follows:[10]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Rank (1\u201310) | University | Rank (11\u201320) | University | Rank (21\u201330) | University | Rank (30\u201340) | University\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | University of St Andrews | 11 | Lancaster University | 21= | University of Sheffield | 30= | University of Essex |\n| 2 | University of Oxford | 12 | University of Aberdeen | 21= | University of Surrey | 32 | University of West London |\n| 3 | University of Cambridge | 13 | University of Glasgow | 23 | King's College London | 33= | University of East Anglia |\n| 4 | London School of Economics | 14 | University of Edinburgh | 24 | University of Manchester | 33= | University of Portsmouth |\n| 5 | Imperial College London | 15 | University of the Arts London | 25= | Aston University | 35 | Edge Hill University |\n| 6 | University of Bath | 16 | University of Strathclyde | 25= | Swansea University | 36 | University of Liverpool |\n| 7 | Durham University | 17 | University of Bristol | 27 | University of Leeds | 37 | University of Birmingham |\n| 8 | University College London | 18 | University of Exeter | 28 | Ulster University | 38= | Northumbria University |\n| 9 | University of Warwick | 19 | University of York | 29 | Cardiff University | 38= | University of Chichester |\n| 10 | Loughborough University | 20 | University of Southampton | 30= | University of Bolton | 40 | Glasgow Caledonian University |\n\n\n### *The Times/The Sunday Times*[edit]\n\n\n*The Times/The Sunday Times* university league table, known as the Good University Guide,[11] is published in both electronic and print format and ranks institutions using the following eight criteria:[12]\n\n\n\n* \"Student satisfaction (+50 to \u221255 points)\" \u2013 the results of national student surveys are scored taking a theoretical minimum and maximum score of 50% and 90% respectively (data source: the National Student Survey);\n* \"Teaching excellence (250)\" \u2013 defined as: subjects scoring at least 22/24 points, those ranked excellent, or those undertaken more recently in which there is confidence in academic standards and in which teaching and learning, student progression and learning resources have all been ranked commendable (data source: Quality Assurance Agency; Scottish Higher Education Funding Council; Higher Education Funding Council for Wales);\n* \"Heads'/peer assessments (100)\" \u2013 school heads are asked to identify the highest-quality undergraduate provision (data source: *The Sunday Times* heads' survey and peer assessment);\n* \"Research quality (200)\" \u2013 based upon the most recent Research Assessment Exercise (data source: Higher Education Funding Council for England (Hefce));\n* \"A-level/Higher points (250)\" \u2013 nationally audited data for the subsequent academic year are used for league table calculations (data source: HESA);\n* \"Unemployment (100)\" \u2013 the number of students assume to be unemployed six months after graduation is calculated as a percentage of the total number of known desbefore completing their courses is compared with the number expected to do so (the benchmark figure shown in brackets) (data source: Hefce, Performance Indicators in Higher Education).\n\n\nOther criteria considered are:\n\n\n\n* \"Completion\" \u2013 the percentage of students who manage to complete their degree;\n* \"Entry standards\" \u2013 the average UCAS tariff score (data source: HESA);\n* \"Facilities spending\" \u2013 the average expenditure per student on sports, careers services, health and counselling;\n* \"Good honours\" \u2013 the percentage of students graduating with a first or 2.1;\n* \"Graduate prospects\" \u2013 the percentage of UK graduates in graduate employment or further study (data source: HESA's survey of Destination of Leavers from Higher Education (DLHE));\n* \"Library and computing spending\" \u2013 the average expenditure on library and computer services per student (data source: HESA);\n* \"Research\" (data source: 2021 Research Excellence Framework);\n* \"Student satisfaction\" (data source: National Student Survey); and\n* \"Student-staff ratio\" (data source: HESA).\n\n\n### Summary of national rankings[edit]\n\n\nThe following universities rank in the top 10 in at least two of the most recent national rankings (the three discussed above: the Complete, Guardian and Times/Sunday Times). The table is ordered according to the Times Higher Education Table of Tables (2022), based on average rank in the tables for that year.[3] The last column gives the number of league tables (not including the Table of Tables) which include that university in their top ten.\n\n\n\n\n\n| University\n | *THE Table of Tables* (2022)[3] | *Complete* (2024)[7] | *Guardian* (2024)[10] | *Times/Sunday Times* (2024)[13] | #a |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| University of Oxford | 1\n | 1\n | 2\n | 2\n | 3b\n |\n| University of Cambridge | 2\n | 2\n | 3\n | 3\n | 3b\n |\n| University of St Andrews | 3\n | 4\n | 1\n | 1\n | 3c\n |\n| London School of Economics | 4\n | 3\n | 4\n | 4\n | 3c\n |\n| Imperial College London | 5\n | 6\n | 5\n | 5\n | 3\n |\n| Durham University | 6\n | 8\n | 7\n | 7\n | 3\n |\n| University of Warwick | 7\n | 11\n | 9\n | 9\n | 2\n |\n| University College London | 8\n | 9\n | 8\n | 6\n | 3\n |\n| University of Bath | 9=\n | 5\n | 6\n | 8\n | 3\n |\n| Loughborough University | 9=\n | 7\n | 10\n | 10\n | 3\n |\n\n\n**Notes:**  \n\na Number of times the university is ranked within the top 10 of one of the three national rankings.   \n\nb The university is ranked within the top 3 of all three national rankings.   \n\nc The university is ranked within the top 5 of all three national rankings.   \n\n\n\n\n\n## Disparity with global rankings[edit]\n\n\nIt has been commented by *The Sunday Times* that a number of universities which regularly feature in the top ten of British university league tables, such as St Andrews, Durham and LSE (in the case of LSE 3rd to 4th nationally whilst only 101\u2013150th in the *ARWU Rankings* / 56th in the *QS Rankings* / 37th in the *THE Rankings*), \"inhabit surprisingly low ranks in the worldwide tables\", whilst other universities such as Manchester, Edinburgh and KCL \"that failed to do well in the domestic rankings have shone much brighter on the international stage\".[14] The considerable disparity in rankings has been attributed to the different methodology and purpose of global university rankings such as the *Academic Ranking of World Universities*, *QS World University Rankings*, and *Times Higher Education World University Rankings*. International university rankings primarily use criteria such as academic and employer surveys, the number of citations per faculty, the proportion of international staff and students and faculty and alumni prize winners.[15][16][17] \nWhen size is taken into account, LSE ranks second in the world out of all small to medium-sized specialist institutions (after ENS Paris) and St Andrews ranks second in the world out of all small to medium-sized fully comprehensive universities (after Brown University) using metrics from the QS Intelligence Unit in 2015.[18] The national rankings, on the other hand, give most weighting to the undergraduate student experience, taking account of teaching quality and learning resources, together with the quality of a university's intake, employment prospects, research quality and drop-out rates.[1][19]\n\n\nThe disparity between national and international league tables has caused some institutions to offer public explanations for the difference. LSE for example states on its website that 'we remain concerned that all of the global rankings \u2013 by some way the most important for us, given our highly international orientation \u2013 suffer from inbuilt biases in favour of large multi-faculty universities with full STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) offerings, and against small, specialist, mainly non-STEM universities such as LSE.'[20]\n\n\nResearch by the UK's Higher Education Policy Institute (HEPI) in 2016 found that global rankings fundamentally measure research performance, with research-related measures accounting for over 85 percent of the weighting for both the *Times Higher Education* and *QS* rankings and 100 percent of the weighting for the *ARWU* ranking. HEPI also found that *ARWU* made no correction for the size of an institution. There were also concerns about the data quality and the reliability of reputation surveys. National rankings, while said to be \"of varying validity\", have more robust data and are \"more highly regarded than international rankings\".[21]\n\n\n\n### British Universities in global rankings[edit]\n\n\nThe following universities rank in the top 100 in at least two global rankings:\n\n\n\nSee also: College and university rankings\n\n\n\n| University\n | *ARWU* (2023)[22] | *QS* (2024)[23] | *THE* (2024)[24] | #a |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| University of Cambridge | 4\n | 2\n | 5\n | 3b\n |\n| University of Oxford | 7\n | 3\n | 1\n | 3b\n |\n| University College London | 17\n | 9\n | 22\n | 3b\n |\n| Imperial College London | 23\n | 6\n | 8\n | 3b\n |\n| University of Edinburgh | 38\n | 22\n | 30=\n | 3c\n |\n| University of Manchester | 41\n | 32\n | 51\n | 3\n |\n| King's College London | 59\n | 40\n | 38=\n | 3\n |\n| University of Bristol | 88\n | 55\n | 81\n | 3\n |\n| University of Glasgow | 101\u2013150\n | 76=\n | 87=\n | 2\n |\n| London School of Economics | 151\u2013200\n | 45\n | 46\n | 2\n |\n| University of Southampton | 151\u2013200\n | 81=\n | 97=\n | 2\n |\n\n\n**Notes:**  \n\na Number of times the university is ranked within the top 100 of one of the three global rankings.   \n\nb The university is ranked within the top 25 of all three global rankings.   \n\nc The university is ranked within the top 50 of all three global rankings.   \n\n\n\n\n## Criticism[edit]\n\n\n### Accuracy and neutrality[edit]\n\n\nThere has been criticism of attempts to combine different rankings on for example research quality, quality of teaching, drop out rates and student satisfaction. Sir Alan Wilson, former Vice-Chancellor of the University of Leeds argues that the final average has little significance and is like trying to \"combine apples and oranges\".[25] He also criticised the varying weights given to different factors, the need for universities to \"chase\" the rankings, the often fluctuating nature of a university's ranking, and the catch-22 that the government's desire to increase access can have negative effects on league table rankings.[25] Further worries have been expressed regarding marketing strategies and propaganda used to chase tables undermining Universities values.[26]\n\n\n*The Guardian* suggests that league tables may affect the nature of undergraduate admissions in an attempt to improve a university's league table position.[27]\n\n\nRoger Brown, the former Vice-Chancellor of Southampton Solent University, highlights perceived limitations in comparative data between Universities.[28]\n\n\nWriting in *The Guardian*, Professor Geoffrey Alderman makes the point that including the percentage of 'good honours' can encourage grade inflation so that league table position can be maintained.[29]\n\n\nThe rankings are also criticised for not giving a full picture of higher education in the United Kingdom. There are institutions which focus on research and enjoy a prestigious reputation but are not shown in the table for various reasons. For example, the Institute of Education, University of London (now part of UCL), was not usually listed in the undergraduate rankings despite the fact that it offered an undergraduate BEd and was generally recognised as one of the best institutions offering teacher training and Education studies (for example, being given joint first place, alongside Oxford University, in the 2008 Research Assessment 'Education' subject rankings, according to both Times Higher Education and The Guardian).[30][31]\n\n\nThe INORMS Research Evaluation Group have developed an initiative called More Than Our Rank[32] which allows universities to describe in a narrative format their activities, achievements and ambitions not captured by any university ranking.\n\n\n\n### Full-time bias[edit]\n\n\nLeague tables, which usually focus on the *full-time* undergraduate student experience, commonly omit reference to Birkbeck, University of London, and the Open University, both of which specialise in teaching part-time students. These universities, however, often make a strong showing in specialist league tables looking at research, teaching quality, and student satisfaction. In the 2008 Research Assessment Exercise, according to the *Times Higher Education*, Birkbeck was placed equal 33rd, and the Open University 43rd, out of 132 institutions.[33] The 2009 student satisfaction survey placed the Open University 3rd and Birkbeck 13th out of 153 universities and higher education institutions (1st and 6th, respectively, among multi-faculty universities).[34] In 2018, Birkbeck announced that it will withdraw from UK university rankings because their methodologies unfairly penalise it, since \"despite having highly-rated teaching and research, other factors caused by its unique teaching model and unrelated to its performance push it significantly down the ratings\".[35]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** \"The Guardian University League Table 2011 \u2013 Methodology\" (PDF). *The Guardian*.

Due to a high proportion of applicants receiving the highest school grades, an interview process was introduced as a component of consideration for admission. Interviews are performed by College Fellows, who evaluate candidates on unexamined factors including potential for original thinking and creativity.[114] For exceptional candidates, a matriculation offer is sometimes offered, requiring only two A-levels at grade E or above. Sutton Trust maintains that the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge recruit disproportionately from eight schools, which account for 1,310 Oxbridge places over three years contrasted with 1,220 from 2,900 other schools.[115]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n179. **^** \"About the Union\".

Thereafter, an increasing number of students lived in colleges rather than in halls and religious houses.[25]\n\n\nIn 1333\u20131334, an attempt by some dissatisfied Oxford scholars to found a new university at Stamford, Lincolnshire, was blocked by the universities of Oxford and Cambridge petitioning King Edward III.[29] Thereafter, until the 1820s, no new universities were allowed to be founded in England, even in London; thus, Oxford and Cambridge had a duopoly, which was unusual in large western European countries.[30][31]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n86. **^** Dennis, Farrington; Palfreyman, David (21 February 2011). \"OFFA and \u00a36000\u20139000 tuition fees\" (PDF). *OxCHEPS Occasional Paper No. 39*.

Note, however, that any university which does not want funding from HEFCE can, as a private corporation, charge whatever tuition fees it likes (exactly as does, say, the University of Buckingham or BPP University College). Under existing legislation and outside of the influence of the HEFCE-funding mechanism upon universities, Government can no more control university tuition fees than it can dictate the price of socks in Marks & Spencer. Universities are not part of the State and they are not part of the public sector; Government has no reserve powers of intervention even in a failing institution.\n87. **^** \"Conference of Colleges\".

Archibald Campbell Tait, former headmaster of Rugby School, was a key member of the Oxford Commission; he wanted Oxford to follow the German and Scottish model in which the professorship was paramount. The commission's report envisioned a centralised university run predominantly by professors and faculties, with a much stronger emphasis on research. The professional staff should be strengthened and better paid. For students, restrictions on entry should be dropped, and more opportunities given to poorer families. It called for an enlargement of the curriculum, with honours to be awarded in many new fields. Undergraduate scholarships should be open to all Britons. Graduate fellowships should be opened up to all members of the university. It recommended that fellows be released from an obligation for ordination. Students were to be allowed to save money by boarding in the city, instead of in a college.[48][49]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n144. **^** \"Regulations on the number and length of terms\". *University of Oxford*.
