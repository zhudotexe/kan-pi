It includes sovereign states, inhabited dependent territories and, in some cases, constituent countries of sovereign states, with inclusion within the list being primarily based on the ISO standard ISO 3166-1. For instance, the United Kingdom is considered a single entity, while the constituent countries of the Kingdom of the Netherlands are considered separately. In addition, this list includes certain states with limited recognition not found in ISO 3166-1. Also given in a percentage is each country's population compared with the world population, which the United Nations estimates at 8.11 billion as of 2023[update].[1]\n\n\n\n\n## Method[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n6. **^** \"India to overtake China as world's most populous country in Apr 2023\". *United Nations*. 24 April 2023.
