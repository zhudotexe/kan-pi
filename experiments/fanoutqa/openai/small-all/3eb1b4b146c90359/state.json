He was the sixth running back to be selected in the 2005 NFL Draft. In addition, he was the third of five Miami Hurricanes to be selected that year.[37]\n\n\n\n#### 2005 season: Rookie year[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2005 San Francisco 49ers season\n\nGore signed a three-year contract with the team on July 28, 2005. He played in 14 games, starting one, in the 2005 season. Gore was inactive for two contests with a groin injury. He finished the season seventh among all NFL rookie running backs in rushing average with 4.8 average per run. He led the team in rushing with 608 yards on 127 carries and three rushing touchdowns.[38][39] Gore also caught 15 passes for 131 yards. His season was the first time a rookie led the 49ers in rushing since 1990, when Dexter Carter paced the team with 460 yards.[40] Gore's 608 rushing yards was the highest for a 49ers rookie since Roger Craig had 725 yards rushing in 1983.[41]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nSan Francisco 49ers 2005 NFL draft selections\n |\n| --- |\n| * Alex Smith\n* David Baas\n* Frank Gore\n* Adam Snyder\n* Ronald Fields\n* Rasheed Marshall\n* Derrick Johnson\n* Daven Holly\n* Marcus Maxwell\n* Patrick Estes\n* Billy Bajema\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nArt Rooney Award winners\n |\n| --- |\n| * 2014: Fitzgerald\n* 2015: Woodson\n* 2016: Gore\n* 2017: Kuechly\n* 2018: Brees\n* 2019: Peterson\n* 2020: Bridgewater\n* 2021: Slater\n* 2022: Campbell\n* 2023: Wagner\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nNFL players with 10,000 rushing yards\n |\n| --- |\n| * Emmitt Smith\n* Walter Payton\n* Frank Gore\n* Barry Sanders\n* *Adrian Peterson*\n* Curtis Martin\n* LaDainian Tomlinson\n* Jerome Bettis\n* Eric Dickerson\n* Tony Dorsett\n* Jim Brown\n* Marshall Faulk\n* Edgerrin James\n* Marcus Allen\n* Franco Harris\n* Thurman Thomas\n* Fred Taylor\n* Steven Jackson\n* John Riggins\n* Corey Dillon\n* O.

The 5.4 yards per carry are tied for the second-best in 49ers history. Among players with over 300 carries, however, Gore's season puts him in elite company. Very few times has a player averaged as many yards per carry as Gore did while carrying the ball over 300 times.

Fason played college football for the University of Florida, and thereafter, he played professionally for the Minnesota Vikings of the NFL.\n\n\n\n\n## Early years[edit]\n\n\nFason was born in Atlanta, Georgia.[1] He attended Duncan U. Fletcher High School in Neptune Beach, Florida,[2] and he was a star running back and four-time most valuable player for the Fletcher Senators high school football team.[3] He rushed for over 7,400 career yards\u2014twice for over 2,000 yards in a season\u2014and finished his high school career as Florida's fifth all-time leading rusher and tops in Northeast Florida history.[3] *Parade* magazine and PrepStar recognized Fason as a high school All-American in 2001.[3] Rated as a five-star recruit by Rivals.com, Fason was listed as the top running back prospect in the nation in 2002.[4]\n\n\n\n## College career[edit]\n\n\nFason received an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida,[3] where he played for coach Ron Zook's Florida Gators football team from 2002 to 2004.[5] As a sophomore in 2003, he had a 75-yard touchdown run against the Arkansas Razorbacks and rushed for 190 yards against the South Carolina Gamecocks.[3] During his junior season in 2004, Fason was named a team captain, and rushed for 1,267 yards on 222 carries and caught thirty-five passes for 266 yards\u2014a total of 1,533 offensive yards (fourth best in Gators history).[5] After the season, he was recognized as an Associated Press first-team All-Southeastern Conference (SEC) selection and a CNN-*Sports Illustrated* honorable mention All-American, and was the recipient of the Gators' most valuable player award and their Fergie Ferguson Award\u2014recognizing the team member who \"displayed outstanding leadership, character and courage.\"[5] After his junior year, he decided to forgo his final season of NCAA eligibility and declared for the NFL Draft.[3]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### Minnesota Vikings[edit]\n\n\nThe Minnesota Vikings selected Fason in the fourth round (112th pick overall) of the 2005 NFL Draft.[6] He played for the Vikings for two seasons in 2005 and 2006.[7] During his two years with the Vikings, he appeared in eighteen regular season games, rushing for 161 yards and five touchdowns on fifty carries.[1] On August 31, 2007, the Vikings released him.\n\n\n\n### Jacksonville Jaguars[edit]\n\n\nIn 2008, Fason worked out for his hometown Jacksonville Jaguars. He wrote a letter to Jaguars GM James Harris asking if he could at least try out. Fason stated in a press conference, \"No matter what I did in my NFL career, I just wanted to wear a Jaguars' uniform, even if it was just for a tryout.\" On August 25, 2008, Fason was signed by the Jaguars; on August 30, he was released.\n\n\n\n### Edmonton Eskimos[edit]\n\n\nFason was signed by the Edmonton Eskimos on April 24, 2009.[8][9] He was released on June 25, 2009, re-signed on July 5, and released again on August 25.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)American football portal\n* ![icon](image)College football portal\n\n\n* List of Florida Gators in the NFL Draft\n* List of Minnesota Vikings players\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Pro-Football-Reference.com, Players, Ciatrick Fason.

He led the team in rushing with 608 yards on 127 carries and three rushing touchdowns.[38][39] Gore also caught 15 passes for 131 yards. His season was the first time a rookie led the 49ers in rushing since 1990, when Dexter Carter paced the team with 460 yards.[40] Gore's 608 rushing yards was the highest for a 49ers rookie since Roger Craig had 725 yards rushing in 1983.[41]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nSan Francisco 49ers 2005 NFL draft selections\n |\n| --- |\n| * Alex Smith\n* David Baas\n* Frank Gore\n* Adam Snyder\n* Ronald Fields\n* Rasheed Marshall\n* Derrick Johnson\n* Daven Holly\n* Marcus Maxwell\n* Patrick Estes\n* Billy Bajema\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nArt Rooney Award winners\n |\n| --- |\n| * 2014: Fitzgerald\n* 2015: Woodson\n* 2016: Gore\n* 2017: Kuechly\n* 2018: Brees\n* 2019: Peterson\n* 2020: Bridgewater\n* 2021: Slater\n* 2022: Campbell\n* 2023: Wagner\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nNFL players with 10,000 rushing yards\n |\n| --- |\n| * Emmitt Smith\n* Walter Payton\n* Frank Gore\n* Barry Sanders\n* *Adrian Peterson*\n* Curtis Martin\n* LaDainian Tomlinson\n* Jerome Bettis\n* Eric Dickerson\n* Tony Dorsett\n* Jim Brown\n* Marshall Faulk\n* Edgerrin James\n* Marcus Allen\n* Franco Harris\n* Thurman Thomas\n* Fred Taylor\n* Steven Jackson\n* John Riggins\n* Corey Dillon\n* O.

Fason played college football for the University of Florida, and thereafter, he played professionally for the Minnesota Vikings of the NFL.\n\n\n\n\n## Early years[edit]\n\n\nFason was born in Atlanta, Georgia.[1] He attended Duncan U. Fletcher High School in Neptune Beach, Florida,[2] and he was a star running back and four-time most valuable player for the Fletcher Senators high school football team.[3] He rushed for over 7,400 career yards\u2014twice for over 2,000 yards in a season\u2014and finished his high school career as Florida's fifth all-time leading rusher and tops in Northeast Florida history.[3] *Parade* magazine and PrepStar recognized Fason as a high school All-American in 2001.[3] Rated as a five-star recruit by Rivals.com, Fason was listed as the top running back prospect in the nation in 2002.[4]\n\n\n\n## College career[edit]\n\n\nFason received an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida,[3] where he played for coach Ron Zook's Florida Gators football team from 2002 to 2004.[5] As a sophomore in 2003, he had a 75-yard touchdown run against the Arkansas Razorbacks and rushed for 190 yards against the South Carolina Gamecocks.[3] During his junior season in 2004, Fason was named a team captain, and rushed for 1,267 yards on 222 carries and caught thirty-five passes for 266 yards\u2014a total of 1,533 offensive yards (fourth best in Gators history).[5] After the season, he was recognized as an Associated Press first-team All-Southeastern Conference (SEC) selection and a CNN-*Sports Illustrated* honorable mention All-American, and was the recipient of the Gators' most valuable player award and their Fergie Ferguson Award\u2014recognizing the team member who \"displayed outstanding leadership, character and courage.\"[5] After his junior year, he decided to forgo his final season of NCAA eligibility and declared for the NFL Draft.[3]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### Minnesota Vikings[edit]\n\n\nThe Minnesota Vikings selected Fason in the fourth round (112th pick overall) of the 2005 NFL Draft.[6] He played for the Vikings for two seasons in 2005 and 2006.[7] During his two years with the Vikings, he appeared in eighteen regular season games, rushing for 161 yards and five touchdowns on fifty carries.[1] On August 31, 2007, the Vikings released him.\n\n\n\n### Jacksonville Jaguars[edit]\n\n\nIn 2008, Fason worked out for his hometown Jacksonville Jaguars. He wrote a letter to Jaguars GM James Harris asking if he could at least try out. Fason stated in a press conference, \"No matter what I did in my NFL career, I just wanted to wear a Jaguars' uniform, even if it was just for a tryout.\" On August 25, 2008, Fason was signed by the Jaguars; on August 30, he was released.\n\n\n\n### Edmonton Eskimos[edit]\n\n\nFason was signed by the Edmonton Eskimos on April 24, 2009.[8][9] He was released on June 25, 2009, re-signed on July 5, and released again on August 25.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)American football portal\n* ![icon](image)College football portal\n\n\n* List of Florida Gators in the NFL Draft\n* List of Minnesota Vikings players\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Pro-Football-Reference.com, Players, Ciatrick Fason.
