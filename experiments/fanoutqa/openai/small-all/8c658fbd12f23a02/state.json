According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), OPEC's combined rate of oil production (including gas condensate) represented 44% of the world's total in 2016,[163] and OPEC accounted for 81.5% of the world's \"proven\" oil reserves.\n\n\nApproval of a new member country requires agreement by three-quarters of OPEC's existing members, including all five of the founders.[9] In October 2015, Sudan formally submitted an application to join,[164] but it is not yet a member.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** One petroleum barrel (bbl) is approximately 42 U.S. gallons, or 159\u00a0liters, or 0.159\u00a0m3, varying slightly with temperature. To put the production numbers in context, a supertanker typically holds 2,000,000\u00a0barrels (320,000\u00a0m3),[170] and the world's current production rate would take approximately 56 years to exhaust the world's current proven reserves.\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** The five founding members attended the first OPEC conference in September 1960.\n3. **^** The UAE was founded in December 1971. Its OPEC membership originated with the Emirate of Abu Dhabi.\n\n### OPEC+[edit]\n\n\nA number of non-OPEC member countries also participate in the organisation's initiatives such as voluntary supply cuts in order to further bind policy objectives between OPEC and non-OPEC members.[8] This loose grouping of countries, known as OPEC+, includes Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Brunei, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Mexico, Oman, Russia, South Sudan and Sudan.[171][172]\n\n\n\n### Observers[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring 1961\u20131975, the five founding nations were joined by Qatar (1961), Indonesia (1962\u20132008, rejoined 2014\u20132016), Libya (1962), United Arab Emirates (originally just the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, 1967), Algeria (1969), Nigeria (1971), Ecuador (1973\u20131992, 2007\u20132020), and Gabon (1975\u20131994, rejoined 2016).[37] By the early 1970s, OPEC's membership accounted for more than half of worldwide oil production.[38] Indicating that OPEC is not averse to further expansion, Mohammed Barkindo, OPEC's acting secretary general in 2006, urged his African neighbors Angola and Sudan to join,[39] and Angola did in 2007, followed by Equatorial Guinea in 2017.[40] Since the 1980s, representatives from Canada, Egypt, Mexico, Norway, Oman, Russia, and other oil-exporting nations have attended many OPEC meetings as observers, as an informal mechanism for coordinating policies.[41]\n\n\n\n### 1973\u20131974: oil embargo[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 1973 oil crisis\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe formation of OPEC marked a turning point toward national sovereignty over natural resources. OPEC decisions have come to play a prominent role in the global oil-market and in international relations. Economists have characterized OPEC as a textbook example of a cartel[5]\n(a group whose members cooperate to reduce market competition) but one whose consultations may be protected by the doctrine of state immunity under international law.[6]\n\n\nCurrent OPEC members are[ref] Algeria, Angola, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, the Republic of the Congo, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela. Meanwhile, Ecuador, Indonesia and Qatar are former OPEC members.[7] A larger group called **OPEC+**, consisting of OPEC members plus other oil-producing countries, formed in late 2016 to exert more control on the global crude-oil market.[8] Canada, Egypt, Norway and Oman are observer states.\n\n\n\n\n## Organization and structure[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn a series of steps in the 1960s and 1970s, OPEC restructured the global system of oil production in favor of oil-producing states and away from an oligopoly of dominant Anglo-American oil firms (the Seven Sisters).[3] Coordination among oil-producing states within OPEC made it easier for them to nationalize oil production and structure oil prices in their favor without incurring punishment by Western governments and firms.[3] Prior to the creation of OPEC, individual oil-producing states were punished for taking steps to alter the governing arrangements of oil production within their borders.[3] States were coerced militarily (e.g. in 1953, the US-UK-sponsored a coup against Mohammad Mosaddegh after he nationalized Iran's oil production) or economically (e.g. the Seven Sisters slowed down oil production in one non-compliant state and ramped up oil production elsewhere) when acted contrary to the interests of the Seven Sisters and their governments.[3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![refer to caption](image)Countries by net oil exports (2008)\nThe differing economic needs of OPEC member states often affect the internal debates behind OPEC production quotas. Poorer members have pushed for production cuts from fellow members, to increase the price of oil and thus their own revenues.[98] These proposals conflict with Saudi Arabia's stated long-term strategy of being a partner with the world's economic powers to ensure a steady flow of oil that would support economic expansion.[99] Part of the basis for this policy is the Saudi concern that overly expensive oil or unreliable supply will drive industrial nations to conserve energy and develop alternative fuels, curtailing the worldwide demand for oil and eventually leaving unneeded barrels in the ground.[100] To this point, Saudi Oil Minister Yamani famously remarked in 1973: \"The Stone Age didn't end because we ran out of stones.\"[101]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe **Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries** (**OPEC**, /\u02c8o\u028ap\u025bk/ *OH-pek*) is an organization enabling the co-operation of leading oil-producing countries in order to collectively influence the global oil market and maximize profit. It was founded on 14 September 1960 in Baghdad by the first five members (Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela). The 13\u00a0member countries account for an estimated 30\u00a0percent of global oil production.[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n22. **^** Ross, Michael L.

The United States had established the Interstate Oil Compact Commission to join the Texas Railroad Commission in limiting overproduction. The US was simultaneously the world's largest producer and consumer of oil; the world market was dominated by a group of multinational companies known as the \"Seven Sisters\", five of which were headquartered in the US following the breakup of John D. Rockefeller's original Standard Oil monopoly. Oil-exporting countries were eventually motivated to form OPEC as a counterweight to this concentration of political and economic power.[27]\n\n\n\n### 1959\u20131960: anger from exporting countries[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIntergovernmental oil organization\n\nNot to be confused with Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)\n |\n| --- |\n| ![Flag of OPEC](image)\n\nFlag\n |\n| ![OPEC and OPEC+ members](image)OPEC and OPEC+ members\n |\n| Headquarters | Vienna, Austria |\n| Official language | English |\n| Type | Cartel[1] |\n| Membership | * OPEC: 13 members\n* OPEC+: 10 further members\n* Observer state(s): CanadaEgyptNorwayOman\n |\n| Leaders |\n|  |\n| \u2022\u00a0Secretary General\n | Haitham al-Ghais |\n|  |\n| Establishment | Baghdad, Iraq |\n|  |\n| \u2022\u00a0Statute\n | September 1960 (63 years ago)\u00a0(September 1960) |\n| \u2022\u00a0In effect\n | January 1961 (63 years ago)\u00a0(January 1961) |\n|  |\n| **Website**opec.org\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | 101,500,000,000\n |\n| Libya | North Africa\n | Since 1962\n | 6,735,277\n | 1,759,540\n | 1,237,808\n | 48,363,000,000\n |\n| Nigeria | West Africa\n | Since 1971\n | 213,401,323\n | 923,768\n | 1,540,991\n | 37,070,000,000\n |\n| Saudi Arabia | Middle East\n | Since 1960[B] | 35,950,396\n | 2,149,690\n | 9,313,145\n | 266,578,000,000\n |\n| United Arab Emirates | Middle East\n | Since 1967[C] | 9,365,145\n | 83,600\n | 3,091,481\n | 97,800,000,000\n |\n| Venezuela | South America | Since 1960[B] | 28,199,867\n | 912,050\n | 594,808\n | 299,953,000,000\n |\n| OPEC total\n | 483,630,000\n | 12,492,695\n | 27,770,543\n | 1,210,703,000,000\n |\n| World total\n | 8,112,380,000\n | 510,072,000\n | 77,043,680\n | 1,650,585,000,000\n |\n| OPEC percent\n | 6.3%\n | 2.4%\n | 36%\n | 73%\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn a series of steps in the 1960s and 1970s, OPEC restructured the global system of oil production in favor of oil-producing states and away from an oligopoly of dominant Anglo-American oil firms (the \"Seven Sisters\").[3] In the 1970s, restrictions in oil production led to a dramatic rise in oil prices with long-lasting and far-reaching consequences for the global economy. Since the 1980s, OPEC has had a limited impact on world oil-supply and oil-price stability, as there is frequent cheating by members on their commitments to one another, and as member commitments reflect what they would do even in the absence of OPEC.[4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n27. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Yergin, Daniel (1991). *The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money, and Power*.

The agreement, signed on 2 April 1971, raised oil prices and increased producing countries' profit shares.[36]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n97. **^** \"149th Meeting of the OPEC Conference\". *OPEC* (Press release). 10 September 2008.

The conference ordinarily meets at the Vienna headquarters, at least twice a year and in additional extraordinary sessions when necessary. It generally operates on the principles of unanimity and \"one member, one vote\", with each country paying an equal membership fee into the annual budget.[9] However, since Saudi Arabia is by far the largest and most-profitable oil exporter in the world, with enough capacity to function as the traditional swing producer to balance the global market, it serves as \"OPEC's *de facto* leader\".[10]\n\n\n\n### International cartel[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n18. **^** Learsy, Raymond J.

In its defense, the organisation was founded as a counterweight against the previous \"Seven Sisters\" cartel of multinational oil companies, and non-OPEC energy suppliers have maintained enough market share for a substantial degree of worldwide competition.[12] Moreover, because of an economic \"prisoner's dilemma\" that encourages each member nation individually to discount its price and exceed its production quota,[13] widespread cheating within OPEC often erodes its ability to influence global oil prices through collective action.[14][15] Political scientist Jeff Colgan has challenged that OPEC is a cartel, pointing to endemic cheating in the organization: \"A cartel needs to set tough goals and meet them; OPEC sets easy goals and fails to meet even those.\"[4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe following month, during 10\u201314 September 1960, the Baghdad Conference was held at the initiative of Tariki, P\u00e9rez Alfonzo, and Iraqi prime minister Abd al-Karim Qasim, whose country had skipped the 1959 congress.[30] Government representatives from Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela met in Baghdad to discuss ways to increase the price of crude oil produced by their countries, and ways to respond to unilateral actions by the MOCs. Despite strong US opposition: \"Together with Arab and non-Arab producers, Saudi Arabia formed the Organization of Petroleum Export Countries (OPEC) to secure the best price available from the major oil corporations.\"[31] The Middle Eastern members originally called for OPEC headquarters to be in Baghdad or Beirut, but Venezuela argued for a neutral location, and so the organization chose Geneva, Switzerland. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Ansari, Dawud.
