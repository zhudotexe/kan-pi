Due to a high proportion of applicants receiving the highest school grades, an interview process was introduced as a component of consideration for admission. Interviews are performed by College Fellows, who evaluate candidates on unexamined factors including potential for original thinking and creativity.[114] For exceptional candidates, a matriculation offer is sometimes offered, requiring only two A-levels at grade E or above.

The Union cited a \"values gap\" and threat to \"academic freedom and institutional autonomy\" following the release of internal UAE documents. Citing UAE's history of violating international human rights laws, it warned that university staff were vulnerable under the partnership to repression by gender, sexuality, or freedom of expression.[182]\n\n\nIn 2023, 72% of the Students' Union voted in favour of hosting talks regarding the removal of all animal products from cafes and canteens operated by the university's catering services. The students backed vegan food in response to threats to the climate and biodiversity. The vote is non-binding since the university controls the catering service.[183] After the vote, Darwin College decided to serve only vegan food at its May Ball in 2023.[184]\n\n\n\n## Notable alumni and academics[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n9. **^** \"Identity Guidelines – Colour\" (PDF).

In 2009, the two organizations parted ways to produce independent university rankings, the QS World University Rankings and THE World University Rankings. \n\n\nQS’ rankings portfolio have since been expanded to consist of the QS World University Rankings, the QS World University Rankings by Subject, four regional rankings tables including: Asia, Latin America, Europe, Central Asia, the Arab Region, several MBA rankings, and the QS Best Student Cities rankings. \n\n\nIn 2022, QS launched the QS World University Rankings: Sustainability.[1]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Asian University Rankings – QS Asian University Rankings vs. QS World University Rankings™\".

It is a remarkably stable list, relying on long-term factors such as the number of Nobel Prize-winners a university has produced, and number of articles published in Nature and Science journals. But with this narrow focus comes drawbacks. China's priority was for its universities to \"catch up\" on hard scientific research. So if you're looking for raw research power, it's the list for you. If you're a humanities student, or more interested in teaching quality? Not so much.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n### QS World University Rankings[edit]\n\n\nThe QS World University Rankings are released annually, typically in June. The 2023 edition featured 1418 institutions across 100 locations. The rankings are based on a methodology that considers a range of factors, including academic reputation, employer reputation, research impact, and internationalization. The methodology is reviewed annually to ensure that it remains relevant and up-to-date. The most recent methodology used by QS to calculate the rankings includes the following indicators:[19]\n\n\n\n#### Academic reputation[edit]\n\n\nAccounting for 40% of the overall score, academic reputation relates to academic excellence and the scholarly esteem in which the world’s universities are held. It collates more than 150,000 responses from academics in more than 140 countries and locations.[20][21] QS has previously published the job titles and geographical distribution of the participants in this survey.[21]\n\n\n\n#### Faculty/student ratio[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe rankings are regarded as one of the most-widely read university rankings in the world, along with *Academic Ranking of World Universities* and *Times Higher Education World University Rankings*.[2]\n\n\nAccording to Alexa Internet, it is the most widely viewed university ranking worldwide.[3]\n\n\nThe ranking has been criticized for its overreliance on subjective indicators and reputation surveys, which tend to fluctuate over time and form a feedback loop.[4][5][6][7][8]\n\n\nConcerns also exist regarding the global consistency and integrity of the data used to generate the QS rankings.[5][9][10][11]\n\n\nThe development and production of the rankings is overseen by QS Senior Vice President Ben Sowter, who in 2016 was ranked in 40th position in Wonkhe's 2016 \"Higher Education Power List\", a list of what the organisation believed to be the 50 most influential figures in UK (United Kingdom) higher education.[12]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nUniversity rankings published annually by Quacquarelli Symonds\n\n\n\n*QS World University Rankings*| Editor | Ben Sowter (Senior Vice President) |\n| Staff writers | Craig O'Callaghan |\n| Categories | Higher education |\n| Frequency | Annual |\n| Publisher | Quacquarelli Symonds |\n| First issue | 2004; 20 years ago (2004) (in partnership with *THE*)2010; 14 years ago (2010) (on its own) |\n| Country | United Kingdom |\n| Language | English |\n| Website | topuniversities.comqs.comtopmba.com |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nQS publishes the rankings results in the world's media and has entered into partnerships with a number of outlets, including *The Guardian* in the United Kingdom, and *Chosun Ilbo* in South Korea. The first rankings produced by QS independently of *THE*, and using QS's methodology, were released in September 2010; the second rankings were released a year later, in September 2011.\n\n\nQS designed its rankings to assess performance according to what it believes to be key aspects of a university's mission: teaching, research, nurturing employability, and internationalisation.[17]\n\n\nQS has a global presence with offices in Europe, Asia, and the Americas and provides products and services related to student recruitment, events, and consulting services. In 2022, the firm's founder, Nunzio Quacquarelli, was appointed as the company's president. Jessica Turner serves as the company's chief executive officer, responsible for the firm's operations and strategy.[18]\n\n\n\n## Rankings[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n28. **^** \"QS Intelligence Unit – QS Graduate Employability Rankings\". *www.iu.qs.com*.

These include: \n\n\n\n#### Environmental Impact (50%)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nQS was founded by Nunzio Quacquarelli in 1990 to provide information and advice to students looking to study abroad. Since then, the company expanded to include a wider range of higher education-focused products and services before partnering with THE in 2004 to create the THE-QS World University Rankings. \n\n\nA perceived need for an international ranking of universities for UK purposes was highlighted in December 2003 in Richard Lambert's review of university-industry collaboration in Great Britain[13] for HM Treasury, the finance ministry of the United Kingdom. Amongst its recommendations were world university rankings, which Lambert said would help the UK gauge the global standing of its universities.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n21. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"2011 Academic Survey Responses\".

Since then, the number of subjects has increased more than tenfold and is now considered one of the most comprehensive subject-focused rankings. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n### QS World University Rankings: Regional Rankings[edit]\n\n\nIn addition to the World University Rankings, QS produces four regional rankings, including the Arab Region, Asia, Emerging Europe and Central Asia (discontinued), and Latin America. In 2023, QS will launch the QS World University Rankings: Europe. These editions include an expanded roster of ranked universities for each region than those featured in the QS World University Rankings which only feature the very best in location. \n\n\nWhile the same methodological indicators tend to be used for the regional rankings, the weightings are modified and additional lenses are included to account for the unique characteristics of each region. Additional metrics include incoming and outgoing exchange students, academic staff with a PhD, and web visibility. Accordingly, the performance of institutions within their respective regional rankings can differ significantly from the QS World University Rankings released in the same academic year.[31]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Employability (35% – 30% in Finance and Business Analytics)\n* Alumni Outcomes (15% – 20% in Finance and Business Analytics)\n* Return on Investment (20%)\n* Thought Leadership (15%)\n* Class and Faculty Diversity (10%)\n\n\nIn addition, QS produces two other annual MBA comparisons, the Online MBA Rankings[33] and the Executive MBA Rankings.[34]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\nIn September 2015, *The Guardian* referred to the QS World University Rankings as \"the most authoritative of their kind\".[35][36]\n\n\nIn September 2012, *The Independent* described the QS World University Rankings as being \"widely recognised throughout higher education as the most trusted international tables\".[37]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn an article titled *The Globalisation of College and University Rankings* and appearing in the January/February 2012 issue of *Change*, Philip Altbach, professor of higher education at Boston College and also a member of the THE editorial board, said: \"The QS World University Rankings are the most problematical. From the beginning, the QS has relied on reputational indicators for half of its analysis … it probably accounts for the significant variability in the QS rankings over the years. In addition, QS queries employers, introducing even more variability and unreliability into the mix. Whether the QS rankings should be taken seriously by the higher education community is questionable.\"[49]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n## QS Stars[edit]\n\n\nQS also offers universities an auditing service that provides in-depth information about institutional strengths and weaknesses. Called QS Stars, this service is separate from the QS World University Rankings. It involves a detailed look at a range of functions which mark out a modern, global university. The minimum result that a university can receive is zero Stars, while truly exceptional, world-leading universities can receive '5\\*+', or 'Five Star Plus', status. The QS Stars audit process evaluates universities according to about 50 different indicators. By 2018, about 20 different universities worldwide had been awarded the maximum possible Five Star Plus rating.[59]\n\n\nQS Stars[60] ratings are derived from scores on in eight out of 12 categories. Four categories are mandatory, while institutions must choose the remaining four optional categories.[61] They are:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n9. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Bekhradnia, Bahram. \"International university rankings: For good or ill?\" (PDF). *Higher Education Policy Institute*.

Some people have expressed concern about the manner in which the academic reputation survey has been carried out.[45] In a report,[46] Peter Wills from the University of Auckland wrote of the *THE*-QS World University Rankings:\n\n\n> But we note also that this survey establishes its rankings by appealing to university staff, even offering financial enticements to participate (see Appendix II). Staff are likely to feel it is in their greatest interest to rank their own institution more highly than others. This means the results of the survey and any apparent change in ranking are highly questionable, and that a high ranking has no real intrinsic value in any case. We are vehemently opposed to the evaluation of the University according to the outcome of such PR competitions.\n> \n> \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nQS World University Rankings: Asia: Top 10\n| Institution | 2023 | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 | 2018\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![China](image)Peking University | 1 | 2 | 7 | 5 | 5 | 9\n |\n| ![Singapore](image)National University of Singapore (NUS) | 2 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 2\n |\n| ![China](image)Tsinghua University | 3 | 5 | 2 | 4 | 3 | 6\n |\n| ![Hong Kong](image)The University of Hong Kong | 4 | 3 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 5\n |\n| ![Singapore](image)Nanyang Technological University (NTU) | 5 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 3 | 1\n |\n| ![China](image)Fudan University | 6 | 7 | 6 | 7 | 6 | 7\n |\n| ![China](image)Zhejiang University | 7 | 6 | 5 | 6 | 13 | 21\n |\n| ![South Korea](image)Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST) | 8 | 14 | 12 | 9 | 8 | 4\n |\n| ![Malaysia](image)Universiti Malaya (UM) | 9 | 8 | 9 | 13 | 19 | 24\n |\n| ![China](image)Shanghai Jiao Tong University | 10 | 10 | 10 | 17 | 19 | 22\n |\n\n\n#### Emerging Europe and Central Asia (discontinued)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn September 2011, the *New Statesman* labeled the rankings \"The QS World University Rankings are a load of old baloney\" in a headline for an article by David Blanchflower, a labour economist, who wrote that, \"This ranking is complete rubbish and nobody should place any credence in it. The results are based on an entirely flawed methodology that underweights the quality of research and overweights fluff... The QS is a flawed index and should be ignored.\"[47]\n\n\nThe QS Subject Rankings have been dismissed as unreliable by Brian Leiter, who points out that programmes that are known to be high quality, and which rank highly in the Blackwell rankings (e.g., the University of Pittsburgh) fare poorly in the QS ranking for reasons that are not at all clear.[48]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn June 2012, Simon Marginson, a professor of higher education at the University of Melbourne and a member of the THE editorial board, said, \"I will not discuss the QS ranking because the methodology is not sufficiently robust to provide data valid as social science\".[50] On the QS website, QS's Intelligence Unit counter these criticisms by stating in the section on \"Statistical Validity\", reproduced here in completeness: \"Over 62,000 academic respondents contributed to our 2013 academic results, four times more than in 2010. Independent academic reviews have confirmed these results to be more than 99% reliable.\"[51]\n\n\nIn 2021, research published by the Center for Studies in Higher Education at the University of California, Berkeley raised the possibility that institutions that employ QS's consulting services are rewarded with improved rankings. QS denied the possibility and stated that it had firm policies and practices to minimize potential conflicts of interest.[52]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLike many other international university rankings, QS uses a citation database to calculate some of its indicators. The use of these citations databases have been criticised, since they do not include research output from the humanities and social sciences to the same degree as the natural sciences, engineering and medicine.[40]\n\n\nIt has also been pointed out that the indicator 'faculty/student ratio' does not measure commitment to teaching, but rather research intensity, since a large share of the faculty typically spends most or all of their time doing research rather than teaching.[9]\n\n\nSince the split from *Times Higher Education* in 2009, further concerns about the methodology QS uses for its rankings have been brought up by several experts.\n\n\n\nIn October 2010, criticism of the old system came from Fred L. Bookstein, Horst Seidler, Martin Fieder, and Georg Winckler in the journal *Scientomentrics* for the unreliability of QS's methods: \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* University Rankings – based on the performance of universities in a particular city, as measured by the QS World University Rankings.\n* Student Mix – looking at the student population's diversity as well as social and cultural activities.\n* Desirability – concerning factors such as safety, pollution and infrastructure.\n* Employer Activity – assessing employment opportunities for students in a particular city and the number of international companies based there.\n* Affordability – based on factors such as the cost of living, tuition fees and the availability of scholarships and financial support.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n3. **^** \"topuniversities.com Competitive Analysis, Marketing Mix and Traffic – Alexa\".

It is a classic measure used in various ranking systems as an indication of staff resources afforded to students, including teaching capacity, class size, curriculum development, lab and seminar delivery, pastoral care, teaching capacity and class size. QS has admitted that it is a limited metric, particularly in the face of modern enhancements in online teaching methods and content distribution.[22]\n\n\n\n#### Citations/faculty[edit]\n\n\nCitations of published research are among the most widely used inputs to national and global university rankings. The QS World University Rankings used citation data from Thomson (now Thomson Reuters) from 2004 to 2007, and since then has used data from Scopus, part of Elsevier. The total number of citations for a five-year period is divided by the number of academics in a university to yield the score for this measure, which accounts for 20% of a university's score in the rankings. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nUniversity ranking systems\n |\n| --- |\n| Global | * Academic Ranking of World Universities\n* Center for World University Rankings\n* CWTS Leiden Ranking\n* Global University Ranking\n* Mines ParisTech: Professional Ranking of World Universities\n* Performance Ranking of Scientific Papers for World Universities\n* QS World University Rankings\n* Round University Ranking\n* SCImago Institutions Rankings\n* Times Higher Education World University Rankings\n* University Ranking by Academic Performance\n* U.S. News & World Report Best Global University Ranking\n* Webometrics Ranking of World Universities\n* World's Universities with Real Impact\n |\n| Regional | * European Union\n* Latin America\n* South East Asia\n |\n| National | * Australia\n\t+ Excellence in Research for Australia\n* Brazil\n* Canada\n\t+ *Maclean's*\n* China\n\t+ BCUR\n\t+ Wu Shulian\n\t+ CUAA\n\t+ Netbig\n* France\n* Germany\n\t+ CHE\n* India\n* Japan\n\t+ Going broke universities – Disappearing universities\n\t+ Truly Strong Universities\n* Mexico\n\t+ ECUM\n* Pakistan\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBeginning with its 2024 rankings, QS implemented three new indicators to reflect the shifts in higher education, each of which accounts for 5% of the total weightage:\n\n\n\n* International Research Network, primarily referencing an institution's ability to create and sustain research partnerships and worldwide collaboration networks.\n\n\n* Employment Outcomes, reflecting an institution's ability to ensure a high level of employability for their graduates.\n\n\n* Sustainability, reflecting an institution's ability to demonstrate a sustainable existence.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn September 2016, Angel Calderon, principal advisor for planning and research at RMIT University and a member of the QS Advisory Board, said, \"QS Latin American University Rankings has [sic] become the annual international benchmark universities use to ascertain their relative standing in the region\". He further stated that the 2016/17 edition of this ranking demonstrated improved stability.[38]\n\n\n\n## Criticisms[edit]\n\n\nThe reputation surveys have received severe criticism. QS do not reveal the response rates for the survey, but statements from QS indicate that they are very low (2–8 %),[39] which would make the results highly unreliable. Other commentators have pointed at the low validity of the survey, since few people know much about the quality of teaching and research at other institutions but their own.[40][41][42][43][44]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThis survey was introduced in 2005 in the belief that employers track graduate quality, making this a barometer of teaching quality and the level of work readiness acquired by students, a famously problematic factor to measure. University standing here is of special interest to potential students, and acknowledging this was the impetus behind the inaugural QS Graduate Employability Rankings, published in November 2015.[27][28] However, these rankings were subsequently discontinued in 2021, with its data rolled into the QS World University Rankings methodology.\n\n\n\n#### Internationalization[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2009, QS launched the QS World University Rankings: Asia in partnership with The Chosun Ilbo newspaper in Korea to rank universities in Asia independently. The 15th edition, released in 2022, ranked 760 universities, with inclusion based on the United Nations' M49 Standard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBetween 2004 and 2009, QS produced the rankings in partnership with *THE*. In 2009, *THE* announced they would produce their own rankings, the *Times Higher Education World University Rankings*, in partnership with Thomson Reuters. *THE* cited an asserted weakness in the methodology of the original rankings,[14] as well as a perceived favoritism in the existing methodology for science over the humanities,[15] as two of the key reasons for the decision to split with QS.\n\n\nQS retained intellectual property in the prior rankings and the methodology used to compile them,[*citation needed*] which it continued to develop and refine over subsequent iterations.[16]\n\n\n*THE* created a new methodology with Thomson Reuters, and published the first *Times Higher Education World University Rankings* in September 2010.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDzulkifli Abdul Razak, former International Association of Universities president, questioned the reliability and relevance of the QS World University Rankings following release of an independent report from the United Nations University's International Institute for Global Health, which criticised its ranking system and discouraged governments from using these ranking systems in policy and decision making.[53]\n\n\nThe Independent Expert Group (IEG) convened by UNU-IIGH in November 2023 proved how universities that buy products and services from QS have better chances of moving up in those rankings.[54][55] Dzulkifli's statement sparked a lot of discussions within the academic sector in Malaysia, with some supporting his notion while others criticising it as being irrelevant itself.[56][57][58]\n\n\n\n## Events[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_wF7QZXEKHsI4EjvqSHXLH7dW","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

The 2023 edition featured 1418 institutions across 100 locations. The rankings are based on a methodology that considers a range of factors, including academic reputation, employer reputation, research impact, and internationalization. The methodology is reviewed annually to ensure that it remains relevant and up-to-date. The most recent methodology used by QS to calculate the rankings includes the following indicators:[19]\n\n\n\n#### Academic reputation[edit]\n\n\nAccounting for 40% of the overall score, academic reputation relates to academic excellence and the scholarly esteem in which the world’s universities are held. It collates more than 150,000 responses from academics in more than 140 countries and locations.[20][21] QS has previously published the job titles and geographical distribution of the participants in this survey.[21]\n\n\n\n#### Faculty/student ratio[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe rankings are regarded as one of the most-widely read university rankings in the world, along with *Academic Ranking of World Universities* and *Times Higher Education World University Rankings*.[2]\n\n\nAccording to Alexa Internet, it is the most widely viewed university ranking worldwide.[3]\n\n\nThe ranking has been criticized for its overreliance on subjective indicators and reputation surveys, which tend to fluctuate over time and form a feedback loop.[4][5][6][7][8]\n\n\nConcerns also exist regarding the global consistency and integrity of the data used to generate the QS rankings.[5][9][10][11]\n\n\nThe development and production of the rankings is overseen by QS Senior Vice President Ben Sowter, who in 2016 was ranked in 40th position in Wonkhe's 2016 \"Higher Education Power List\", a list of what the organisation believed to be the 50 most influential figures in UK (United Kingdom) higher education.[12]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nUniversity rankings published annually by Quacquarelli Symonds\n\n\n\n*QS World University Rankings*| Editor | Ben Sowter (Senior Vice President) |\n| Staff writers | Craig O'Callaghan |\n| Categories | Higher education |\n| Frequency | Annual |\n| Publisher | Quacquarelli Symonds |\n| First issue | 2004; 20 years ago (2004) (in partnership with *THE*)2010; 14 years ago (2010) (on its own) |\n| Country | United Kingdom |\n| Language | English |\n| Website | topuniversities.comqs.comtopmba.com |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nQS World University Rankings: Sustainability: Top 10\n| University | 2023\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![United States](image)University of California, Berkeley | 1\n |\n| ![Canada](image)University of Toronto | 2\n |\n| ![Canada](image)University of British Columbia | 3\n |\n| ![United Kingdom](image)University of Edinburgh | 4\n |\n| ![Australia](image)University of New South Wales (UNSW Sydney) | =5\n |\n| ![Australia](image)University of Sydney | =5\n |\n| ![Japan](image)University of Tokyo | 7\n |\n| ![United States](image)University of Pennsylvania | 8\n |\n| ![United States](image)Yale University | 9\n |\n| ![New Zealand](image)University of Auckland | 10\n |\n\n\n### QS Global MBA and Business Master’s Rankings[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n28. **^** \"QS Intelligence Unit – QS Graduate Employability Rankings\". *www.iu.qs.com*.

The first rankings produced by QS independently of *THE*, and using QS's methodology, were released in September 2010; the second rankings were released a year later, in September 2011.\n\n\nQS designed its rankings to assess performance according to what it believes to be key aspects of a university's mission: teaching, research, nurturing employability, and internationalisation.[17]\n\n\nQS has a global presence with offices in Europe, Asia, and the Americas and provides products and services related to student recruitment, events, and consulting services. In 2022, the firm's founder, Nunzio Quacquarelli, was appointed as the company's president.

The minimum result that a university can receive is zero Stars, while truly exceptional, world-leading universities can receive '5\\*+', or 'Five Star Plus', status. The QS Stars audit process evaluates universities according to about 50 different indicators. By 2018, about 20 different universities worldwide had been awarded the maximum possible Five Star Plus rating.[59]\n\n\nQS Stars[60] ratings are derived from scores on in eight out of 12 categories. Four categories are mandatory, while institutions must choose the remaining four optional categories.[61] They are:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n9. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Bekhradnia, Bahram. \"International university rankings: For good or ill?\" (PDF). *Higher Education Policy Institute*.

The results are based on an entirely flawed methodology that underweights the quality of research and overweights fluff... The QS is a flawed index and should be ignored.\"[47]\n\n\nThe QS Subject Rankings have been dismissed as unreliable by Brian Leiter, who points out that programmes that are known to be high quality, and which rank highly in the Blackwell rankings (e.g., the University of Pittsburgh) fare poorly in the QS ranking for reasons that are not at all clear.[48]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n### QS World University Rankings: Regional Rankings[edit]\n\n\nIn addition to the World University Rankings, QS produces four regional rankings, including the Arab Region, Asia, Emerging Europe and Central Asia (discontinued), and Latin America. In 2023, QS will launch the QS World University Rankings: Europe. These editions include an expanded roster of ranked universities for each region than those featured in the QS World University Rankings which only feature the very best in location. \n\n\nWhile the same methodological indicators tend to be used for the regional rankings, the weightings are modified and additional lenses are included to account for the unique characteristics of each region. Additional metrics include incoming and outgoing exchange students, academic staff with a PhD, and web visibility. Accordingly, the performance of institutions within their respective regional rankings can differ significantly from the QS World University Rankings released in the same academic year.[31]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn an article titled *The Globalisation of College and University Rankings* and appearing in the January/February 2012 issue of *Change*, Philip Altbach, professor of higher education at Boston College and also a member of the THE editorial board, said: \"The QS World University Rankings are the most problematical. From the beginning, the QS has relied on reputational indicators for half of its analysis … it probably accounts for the significant variability in the QS rankings over the years. In addition, QS queries employers, introducing even more variability and unreliability into the mix. Whether the QS rankings should be taken seriously by the higher education community is questionable.\"[49]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n3. **^** \"topuniversities.com Competitive Analysis, Marketing Mix and Traffic – Alexa\".

Some people have expressed concern about the manner in which the academic reputation survey has been carried out.[45] In a report,[46] Peter Wills from the University of Auckland wrote of the *THE*-QS World University Rankings:\n\n\n> But we note also that this survey establishes its rankings by appealing to university staff, even offering financial enticements to participate (see Appendix II). Staff are likely to feel it is in their greatest interest to rank their own institution more highly than others. This means the results of the survey and any apparent change in ranking are highly questionable, and that a high ranking has no real intrinsic value in any case. We are vehemently opposed to the evaluation of the University according to the outcome of such PR competitions.\n> \n> \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nUniversity ranking systems\n |\n| --- |\n| Global | * Academic Ranking of World Universities\n* Center for World University Rankings\n* CWTS Leiden Ranking\n* Global University Ranking\n* Mines ParisTech: Professional Ranking of World Universities\n* Performance Ranking of Scientific Papers for World Universities\n* QS World University Rankings\n* Round University Ranking\n* SCImago Institutions Rankings\n* Times Higher Education World University Rankings\n* University Ranking by Academic Performance\n* U.S. News & World Report Best Global University Ranking\n* Webometrics Ranking of World Universities\n* World's Universities with Real Impact\n |\n| Regional | * European Union\n* Latin America\n* South East Asia\n |\n| National | * Australia\n\t+ Excellence in Research for Australia\n* Brazil\n* Canada\n\t+ *Maclean's*\n* China\n\t+ BCUR\n\t+ Wu Shulian\n\t+ CUAA\n\t+ Netbig\n* France\n* Germany\n\t+ CHE\n* India\n* Japan\n\t+ Going broke universities – Disappearing universities\n\t+ Truly Strong Universities\n* Mexico\n\t+ ECUM\n* Pakistan\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn June 2012, Simon Marginson, a professor of higher education at the University of Melbourne and a member of the THE editorial board, said, \"I will not discuss the QS ranking because the methodology is not sufficiently robust to provide data valid as social science\".[50] On the QS website, QS's Intelligence Unit counter these criticisms by stating in the section on \"Statistical Validity\", reproduced here in completeness: \"Over 62,000 academic respondents contributed to our 2013 academic results, four times more than in 2010. Independent academic reviews have confirmed these results to be more than 99% reliable.\"[51]\n\n\nIn 2021, research published by the Center for Studies in Higher Education at the University of California, Berkeley raised the possibility that institutions that employ QS's consulting services are rewarded with improved rankings. QS denied the possibility and stated that it had firm policies and practices to minimize potential conflicts of interest.[52]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* University Rankings – based on the performance of universities in a particular city, as measured by the QS World University Rankings.\n* Student Mix – looking at the student population's diversity as well as social and cultural activities.\n* Desirability – concerning factors such as safety, pollution and infrastructure.\n* Employer Activity – assessing employment opportunities for students in a particular city and the number of international companies based there.\n* Affordability – based on factors such as the cost of living, tuition fees and the availability of scholarships and financial support.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLike many other international university rankings, QS uses a citation database to calculate some of its indicators. The use of these citations databases have been criticised, since they do not include research output from the humanities and social sciences to the same degree as the natural sciences, engineering and medicine.[40]\n\n\nIt has also been pointed out that the indicator 'faculty/student ratio' does not measure commitment to teaching, but rather research intensity, since a large share of the faculty typically spends most or all of their time doing research rather than teaching.[9]\n\n\nSince the split from *Times Higher Education* in 2009, further concerns about the methodology QS uses for its rankings have been brought up by several experts.\n\n\n\nIn October 2010, criticism of the old system came from Fred L.

Its first and earliest edition was published in collaboration with *Times Higher Education* (*THE*) magazine as Times Higher Education–QS World University Rankings, inaugurated in 2004 to provide an independent source of comparative data about university performance. In 2009, the two organizations parted ways to produce independent university rankings, the QS World University Rankings and THE World University Rankings. \n\n\nQS’ rankings portfolio have since been expanded to consist of the QS World University Rankings, the QS World University Rankings by Subject, four regional rankings tables including: Asia, Latin America, Europe, Central Asia, the Arab Region, several MBA rankings, and the QS Best Student Cities rankings. \n\n\nIn 2022, QS launched the QS World University Rankings: Sustainability.[1]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n### QS World University Rankings[edit]\n\n\nThe QS World University Rankings are released annually, typically in June. The 2023 edition featured 1418 institutions across 100 locations. The rankings are based on a methodology that considers a range of factors, including academic reputation, employer reputation, research impact, and internationalization. The methodology is reviewed annually to ensure that it remains relevant and up-to-date. The most recent methodology used by QS to calculate the rankings includes the following indicators:[19]\n\n\n\n#### Academic reputation[edit]\n\n\nAccounting for 40% of the overall score, academic reputation relates to academic excellence and the scholarly esteem in which the world’s universities are held. It collates more than 150,000 responses from academics in more than 140 countries and locations.[20][21] QS has previously published the job titles and geographical distribution of the participants in this survey.[21]\n\n\n\n#### Faculty/student ratio[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe rankings are regarded as one of the most-widely read university rankings in the world, along with *Academic Ranking of World Universities* and *Times Higher Education World University Rankings*.[2]\n\n\nAccording to Alexa Internet, it is the most widely viewed university ranking worldwide.[3]\n\n\nThe ranking has been criticized for its overreliance on subjective indicators and reputation surveys, which tend to fluctuate over time and form a feedback loop.[4][5][6][7][8]\n\n\nConcerns also exist regarding the global consistency and integrity of the data used to generate the QS rankings.[5][9][10][11]\n\n\nThe development and production of the rankings is overseen by QS Senior Vice President Ben Sowter, who in 2016 was ranked in 40th position in Wonkhe's 2016 \"Higher Education Power List\", a list of what the organisation believed to be the 50 most influential figures in UK (United Kingdom) higher education.[12]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Asian University Rankings – QS Asian University Rankings vs. QS World University Rankings™\".

In 2023, QS will launch the QS World University Rankings: Europe. These editions include an expanded roster of ranked universities for each region than those featured in the QS World University Rankings which only feature the very best in location. \n\n\nWhile the same methodological indicators tend to be used for the regional rankings, the weightings are modified and additional lenses are included to account for the unique characteristics of each region. Additional metrics include incoming and outgoing exchange students, academic staff with a PhD, and web visibility. Accordingly, the performance of institutions within their respective regional rankings can differ significantly from the QS World University Rankings released in the same academic year.[31]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nQS World University Rankings: Sustainability: Top 10\n| University | 2023\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![United States](image)University of California, Berkeley | 1\n |\n| ![Canada](image)University of Toronto | 2\n |\n| ![Canada](image)University of British Columbia | 3\n |\n| ![United Kingdom](image)University of Edinburgh | 4\n |\n| ![Australia](image)University of New South Wales (UNSW Sydney) | =5\n |\n| ![Australia](image)University of Sydney | =5\n |\n| ![Japan](image)University of Tokyo | 7\n |\n| ![United States](image)University of Pennsylvania | 8\n |\n| ![United States](image)Yale University | 9\n |\n| ![New Zealand](image)University of Auckland | 10\n |\n\n\n### QS Global MBA and Business Master’s Rankings[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n50. **^** \"Improving Latin American universities' global ranking – University World News\".

Retrieved 16 September 2010.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTypically, QS’ first rankings release of the year is the QS World University Rankings by Subject which are usually published in March or April. \n\n\nThe rankings provide a detailed evaluation of universities based on their performance in more than 50 specific academic disciplines (Business, Mathematics, Medicine, Law, among others), as well as their performance in five broad faculty areas (Arts & Humanities, Engineering & Technology, Life Sciences, Natural Sciences, and Social Sciences). \n\n\nThe QS World University Rankings by Subject was first introduced in 2011 and initially covered only five subject areas. Since then, the number of subjects has increased more than tenfold and is now considered one of the most comprehensive subject-focused rankings. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn September 2011, the *New Statesman* labeled the rankings \"The QS World University Rankings are a load of old baloney\" in a headline for an article by David Blanchflower, a labour economist, who wrote that, \"This ranking is complete rubbish and nobody should place any credence in it. The results are based on an entirely flawed methodology that underweights the quality of research and overweights fluff... The QS is a flawed index and should be ignored.\"[47]\n\n\nThe QS Subject Rankings have been dismissed as unreliable by Brian Leiter, who points out that programmes that are known to be high quality, and which rank highly in the Blackwell rankings (e.g., the University of Pittsburgh) fare poorly in the QS ranking for reasons that are not at all clear.[48]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe QS World University Rankings have been criticised by many for placing too much emphasis on reputation, which receives 50% of the overall score. Some people have expressed concern about the manner in which the academic reputation survey has been carried out.[45] In a report,[46] Peter Wills from the University of Auckland wrote of the *THE*-QS World University Rankings:\n\n\n> But we note also that this survey establishes its rankings by appealing to university staff, even offering financial enticements to participate (see Appendix II). Staff are likely to feel it is in their greatest interest to rank their own institution more highly than others. This means the results of the survey and any apparent change in ranking are highly questionable, and that a high ranking has no real intrinsic value in any case. We are vehemently opposed to the evaluation of the University according to the outcome of such PR competitions.\n> \n> \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBeginning with its 2024 rankings, QS implemented three new indicators to reflect the shifts in higher education, each of which accounts for 5% of the total weightage:\n\n\n\n* International Research Network, primarily referencing an institution's ability to create and sustain research partnerships and worldwide collaboration networks.\n\n\n* Employment Outcomes, reflecting an institution's ability to ensure a high level of employability for their graduates.\n\n\n* Sustainability, reflecting an institution's ability to demonstrate a sustainable existence.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThis indicator accounts for 15% of a university's score in the rankings. It is a classic measure used in various ranking systems as an indication of staff resources afforded to students, including teaching capacity, class size, curriculum development, lab and seminar delivery, pastoral care, teaching capacity and class size. QS has admitted that it is a limited metric, particularly in the face of modern enhancements in online teaching methods and content distribution.[22]\n\n\n\n#### Citations/faculty[edit]\n\n\nCitations of published research are among the most widely used inputs to national and global university rankings. The QS World University Rankings used citation data from Thomson (now Thomson Reuters) from 2004 to 2007, and since then has used data from Scopus, part of Elsevier. The total number of citations for a five-year period is divided by the number of academics in a university to yield the score for this measure, which accounts for 20% of a university's score in the rankings. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n## QS Stars[edit]\n\n\nQS also offers universities an auditing service that provides in-depth information about institutional strengths and weaknesses. Called QS Stars, this service is separate from the QS World University Rankings. It involves a detailed look at a range of functions which mark out a modern, global university. The minimum result that a university can receive is zero Stars, while truly exceptional, world-leading universities can receive '5\\*+', or 'Five Star Plus', status. The QS Stars audit process evaluates universities according to about 50 different indicators. By 2018, about 20 different universities worldwide had been awarded the maximum possible Five Star Plus rating.[59]\n\n\nQS Stars[60] ratings are derived from scores on in eight out of 12 categories. Four categories are mandatory, while institutions must choose the remaining four optional categories.[61] They are:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* University Rankings – based on the performance of universities in a particular city, as measured by the QS World University Rankings.\n* Student Mix – looking at the student population's diversity as well as social and cultural activities.\n* Desirability – concerning factors such as safety, pollution and infrastructure.\n* Employer Activity – assessing employment opportunities for students in a particular city and the number of international companies based there.\n* Affordability – based on factors such as the cost of living, tuition fees and the availability of scholarships and financial support.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLike many other international university rankings, QS uses a citation database to calculate some of its indicators. The use of these citations databases have been criticised, since they do not include research output from the humanities and social sciences to the same degree as the natural sciences, engineering and medicine.[40]\n\n\nIt has also been pointed out that the indicator 'faculty/student ratio' does not measure commitment to teaching, but rather research intensity, since a large share of the faculty typically spends most or all of their time doing research rather than teaching.[9]\n\n\nSince the split from *Times Higher Education* in 2009, further concerns about the methodology QS uses for its rankings have been brought up by several experts.\n\n\n\nIn October 2010, criticism of the old system came from Fred L. Bookstein, Horst Seidler, Martin Fieder, and Georg Winckler in the journal *Scientomentrics* for the unreliability of QS's methods: \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn June 2012, Simon Marginson, a professor of higher education at the University of Melbourne and a member of the THE editorial board, said, \"I will not discuss the QS ranking because the methodology is not sufficiently robust to provide data valid as social science\".[50] On the QS website, QS's Intelligence Unit counter these criticisms by stating in the section on \"Statistical Validity\", reproduced here in completeness: \"Over 62,000 academic respondents contributed to our 2013 academic results, four times more than in 2010. Independent academic reviews have confirmed these results to be more than 99% reliable.\"[51]\n\n\nIn 2021, research published by the Center for Studies in Higher Education at the University of California, Berkeley raised the possibility that institutions that employ QS's consulting services are rewarded with improved rankings. QS denied the possibility and stated that it had firm policies and practices to minimize potential conflicts of interest.[52]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n3. **^** \"topuniversities.com Competitive Analysis, Marketing Mix and Traffic – Alexa\".

QS do not reveal the response rates for the survey, but statements from QS indicate that they are very low (2–8 %),[39] which would make the results highly unreliable. Other commentators have pointed at the low validity of the survey, since few people know much about the quality of teaching and research at other institutions but their own.[40][41][42][43][44]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThis survey was introduced in 2005 in the belief that employers track graduate quality, making this a barometer of teaching quality and the level of work readiness acquired by students, a famously problematic factor to measure. University standing here is of special interest to potential students, and acknowledging this was the impetus behind the inaugural QS Graduate Employability Rankings, published in November 2015.[27][28] However, these rankings were subsequently discontinued in 2021, with its data rolled into the QS World University Rankings methodology.\n\n\n\n#### Internationalization[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBetween 2004 and 2009, QS produced the rankings in partnership with *THE*. In 2009, *THE* announced they would produce their own rankings, the *Times Higher Education World University Rankings*, in partnership with Thomson Reuters. *THE* cited an asserted weakness in the methodology of the original rankings,[14] as well as a perceived favoritism in the existing methodology for science over the humanities,[15] as two of the key reasons for the decision to split with QS.\n\n\nQS retained intellectual property in the prior rankings and the methodology used to compile them,[*citation needed*] which it continued to develop and refine over subsequent iterations.[16]\n\n\n*THE* created a new methodology with Thomson Reuters, and published the first *Times Higher Education World University Rankings* in September 2010.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2009, QS launched the QS World University Rankings: Asia in partnership with The Chosun Ilbo newspaper in Korea to rank universities in Asia independently. The 15th edition, released in 2022, ranked 760 universities, with inclusion based on the United Nations' M49 Standard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_tqy72YYdNwm2V9PR07Mjz7CG","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

The most recent methodology used by QS to calculate the rankings includes the following indicators:[19]\n\n\n\n#### Academic reputation[edit]\n\n\nAccounting for 40% of the overall score, academic reputation relates to academic excellence and the scholarly esteem in which the world’s universities are held.

The first rankings produced by QS independently of *THE*, and using QS's methodology, were released in September 2010; the second rankings were released a year later, in September 2011.\n\n\nQS designed its rankings to assess performance according to what it believes to be key aspects of a university's mission: teaching, research, nurturing employability, and internationalisation.[17]\n\n\nQS has a global presence with offices in Europe, Asia, and the Americas and provides products and services related to student recruitment, events, and consulting services. In 2022, the firm's founder, Nunzio Quacquarelli, was appointed as the company's president. Jessica Turner serves as the company's chief executive officer, responsible for the firm's operations and strategy.[18]\n\n\n\n## Rankings[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nQS was founded by Nunzio Quacquarelli in 1990 to provide information and advice to students looking to study abroad. Since then, the company expanded to include a wider range of higher education-focused products and services before partnering with THE in 2004 to create the THE-QS World University Rankings. \n\n\nA perceived need for an international ranking of universities for UK purposes was highlighted in December 2003 in Richard Lambert's review of university-industry collaboration in Great Britain[13] for HM Treasury, the finance ministry of the United Kingdom. Amongst its recommendations were world university rankings, which Lambert said would help the UK gauge the global standing of its universities.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n21. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"2011 Academic Survey Responses\".

Called QS Stars, this service is separate from the QS World University Rankings. It involves a detailed look at a range of functions which mark out a modern, global university. The minimum result that a university can receive is zero Stars, while truly exceptional, world-leading universities can receive '5\\*+', or 'Five Star Plus', status. The QS Stars audit process evaluates universities according to about 50 different indicators. By 2018, about 20 different universities worldwide had been awarded the maximum possible Five Star Plus rating.[59]\n\n\nQS Stars[60] ratings are derived from scores on in eight out of 12 categories. Four categories are mandatory, while institutions must choose the remaining four optional categories.[61] They are:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n50. **^** \"Improving Latin American universities' global ranking – University World News\".

In 2023, QS will launch the QS World University Rankings: Europe. These editions include an expanded roster of ranked universities for each region than those featured in the QS World University Rankings which only feature the very best in location. \n\n\nWhile the same methodological indicators tend to be used for the regional rankings, the weightings are modified and additional lenses are included to account for the unique characteristics of each region. Additional metrics include incoming and outgoing exchange students, academic staff with a PhD, and web visibility. Accordingly, the performance of institutions within their respective regional rankings can differ significantly from the QS World University Rankings released in the same academic year.[31]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2022, QS launched the QS World University Rankings: Sustainability in response to the growing importance of sustainability in higher education and society at large. \n\n\nThe rankings are compiled using data collected through surveys as well as external sources such as the World Bank and the United Nations to provide a resource for students, academics and policymakers to assess universities’ sustainability performance and identify best practices for achieving sustainability goals. \n\n\nThe rank of the universities featured is determined by the sum of their scores in two categories: Environmental Impact and Social Impact, which are subdivided into eight indicators. These include: \n\n\n\n#### Environmental Impact (50%)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Official website\n* QS Intelligence Unit Blog, a blog on rankings and higher education from the team that compiles  *QS World University Rankings*\n* universityrankings.ch: Comparison and results of *QS World University Rankings*, Shanghai Ranking, Leiden Ranking and Times Higher Education Ranking\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn an article titled *The Globalisation of College and University Rankings* and appearing in the January/February 2012 issue of *Change*, Philip Altbach, professor of higher education at Boston College and also a member of the THE editorial board, said: \"The QS World University Rankings are the most problematical. From the beginning, the QS has relied on reputational indicators for half of its analysis … it probably accounts for the significant variability in the QS rankings over the years. In addition, QS queries employers, introducing even more variability and unreliability into the mix. Whether the QS rankings should be taken seriously by the higher education community is questionable.\"[49]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn September 2011, the *New Statesman* labeled the rankings \"The QS World University Rankings are a load of old baloney\" in a headline for an article by David Blanchflower, a labour economist, who wrote that, \"This ranking is complete rubbish and nobody should place any credence in it. The results are based on an entirely flawed methodology that underweights the quality of research and overweights fluff... The QS is a flawed index and should be ignored.\"[47]\n\n\nThe QS Subject Rankings have been dismissed as unreliable by Brian Leiter, who points out that programmes that are known to be high quality, and which rank highly in the Blackwell rankings (e.g., the University of Pittsburgh) fare poorly in the QS ranking for reasons that are not at all clear.[48]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThis indicator accounts for 15% of a university's score in the rankings. It is a classic measure used in various ranking systems as an indication of staff resources afforded to students, including teaching capacity, class size, curriculum development, lab and seminar delivery, pastoral care, teaching capacity and class size. QS has admitted that it is a limited metric, particularly in the face of modern enhancements in online teaching methods and content distribution.[22]\n\n\n\n#### Citations/faculty[edit]\n\n\nCitations of published research are among the most widely used inputs to national and global university rankings. The QS World University Rankings used citation data from Thomson (now Thomson Reuters) from 2004 to 2007, and since then has used data from Scopus, part of Elsevier. The total number of citations for a five-year period is divided by the number of academics in a university to yield the score for this measure, which accounts for 20% of a university's score in the rankings. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n9. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Bekhradnia, Bahram. \"International university rankings: For good or ill?\" (PDF). *Higher Education Policy Institute*.

Since then, the number of subjects has increased more than tenfold and is now considered one of the most comprehensive subject-focused rankings. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThis survey was introduced in 2005 in the belief that employers track graduate quality, making this a barometer of teaching quality and the level of work readiness acquired by students, a famously problematic factor to measure. University standing here is of special interest to potential students, and acknowledging this was the impetus behind the inaugural QS Graduate Employability Rankings, published in November 2015.[27][28] However, these rankings were subsequently discontinued in 2021, with its data rolled into the QS World University Rankings methodology.\n\n\n\n#### Internationalization[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nQS World University Rankings: Asia: Top 10\n| Institution | 2023 | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 | 2018\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![China](image)Peking University | 1 | 2 | 7 | 5 | 5 | 9\n |\n| ![Singapore](image)National University of Singapore (NUS) | 2 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 2\n |\n| ![China](image)Tsinghua University | 3 | 5 | 2 | 4 | 3 | 6\n |\n| ![Hong Kong](image)The University of Hong Kong | 4 | 3 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 5\n |\n| ![Singapore](image)Nanyang Technological University (NTU) | 5 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 3 | 1\n |\n| ![China](image)Fudan University | 6 | 7 | 6 | 7 | 6 | 7\n |\n| ![China](image)Zhejiang University | 7 | 6 | 5 | 6 | 13 | 21\n |\n| ![South Korea](image)Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST) | 8 | 14 | 12 | 9 | 8 | 4\n |\n| ![Malaysia](image)Universiti Malaya (UM) | 9 | 8 | 9 | 13 | 19 | 24\n |\n| ![China](image)Shanghai Jiao Tong University | 10 | 10 | 10 | 17 | 19 | 22\n |\n\n\n#### Emerging Europe and Central Asia (discontinued)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe QS World University Rankings have been criticised by many for placing too much emphasis on reputation, which receives 50% of the overall score. Some people have expressed concern about the manner in which the academic reputation survey has been carried out.[45] In a report,[46] Peter Wills from the University of Auckland wrote of the *THE*-QS World University Rankings:\n\n\n> But we note also that this survey establishes its rankings by appealing to university staff, even offering financial enticements to participate (see Appendix II). Staff are likely to feel it is in their greatest interest to rank their own institution more highly than others. This means the results of the survey and any apparent change in ranking are highly questionable, and that a high ranking has no real intrinsic value in any case. We are vehemently opposed to the evaluation of the University according to the outcome of such PR competitions.\n> \n> \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLike many other international university rankings, QS uses a citation database to calculate some of its indicators. The use of these citations databases have been criticised, since they do not include research output from the humanities and social sciences to the same degree as the natural sciences, engineering and medicine.[40]\n\n\nIt has also been pointed out that the indicator 'faculty/student ratio' does not measure commitment to teaching, but rather research intensity, since a large share of the faculty typically spends most or all of their time doing research rather than teaching.[9]\n\n\nSince the split from *Times Higher Education* in 2009, further concerns about the methodology QS uses for its rankings have been brought up by several experts.\n\n\n\nIn October 2010, criticism of the old system came from Fred L. Bookstein, Horst Seidler, Martin Fieder, and Georg Winckler in the journal *Scientomentrics* for the unreliability of QS's methods: \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n3. **^** \"topuniversities.com Competitive Analysis, Marketing Mix and Traffic – Alexa\".

There is evidence of teaching as early as 1096,[2] making it the oldest university in the English-speaking world and the world's second-oldest university in continuous operation.[2][11][12] It grew rapidly from 1167, when Henry II banned English students from attending the University of Paris.[2] After disputes between students and Oxford townsfolk in 1209, some academics fled north-east to Cambridge where they established what became the University of Cambridge.[13] The two English ancient universities share many common features and are jointly referred to as *Oxbridge*.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n104. **^** \"Oxford's Said Business School\". *The Guardian*. 10 December 2001.

The current campaign, its second, was launched in May 2008 and is entitled \"Oxford Thinking – The Campaign for the University of Oxford\".[97] This is looking to support three areas: academic posts and programmes, student support, and buildings and infrastructure;[98] having passed its original target of £1.25 billion in March 2012, the target was raised to £3 billion.[99] The campaign had raised a total of £2.8 billion by July 2018.[90]\n\n\n\n#### Funding criticisms[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Wellington Square has become synonymous with the university's central administration.\nThe university's formal head is the Chancellor, currently Lord Patten of Barnes, though as at most British universities, the Chancellor is a titular figurehead and is not involved with the day-to-day running of the university. The Chancellor is elected by the members of Convocation, a body comprising all graduates of the university, and holds office until death.[84]\n\n\nThe Vice-Chancellor, currently Irene Tracey,[6] is the *de facto* head of the university. Five pro-vice-chancellors have specific responsibilities for education; research; planning and resources; development and external affairs; and personnel and equal opportunities. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe university has faced criticism for some of its sources of donations and funding. In 2017, attention was drawn to historical donations including All Souls College receiving £10,000 from slave trader Christopher Codrington in 1710,[100] and Oriel College having receiving taken £100,000 from the will of the imperialist Cecil Rhodes in 1902.[101][102] In 1996 a donation of £20 million was received from Wafic Saïd who was involved in the Al-Yammah arms deal,[103][104] and taking £150 million from the US billionaire businessman Stephen A. Schwarzman in 2019.[105] The university has defended its decisions saying it \"takes legal, ethical and reputational issues into consideration\".\n\n\nThe university has also faced criticism, as noted above, over its decision to accept donations from fossil fuel companies having received £21.8 million from the fossil fuel industry between 2010 and 2015[106] and £18.8 million between 2015 and 2020.[107][108]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Percentage of state-school students at Oxford and Cambridge[122][123]\nIn common with most British universities, prospective undergraduate students apply through the UCAS application system, but prospective applicants for the University of Oxford, along with those for medicine, dentistry, and University of Cambridge applicants, must observe an earlier deadline of 15 October.[124] The Sutton Trust maintains that Oxford University and Cambridge University recruit undergraduates disproportionately from 8 schools which accounted for 1,310 Oxbridge places during three years, contrasted with 1,220 from 2,900 other schools.[125]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_tcrk1h6nYn0CM2zO8WpaFtzQ","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

Springer: 381–417. JSTOR 43548922. \"MIT and UCB were selected as two consistently top ranked universities internationally speaking, not only in terms of prestige in the eyes of international public opinion but also in terms of actual outputs as measured by metrics of excellence. They enjoy a very long tenure in the first decile whatever the classification used, and despite the fact that ranking agencies do not allocate the same weight to excellence and prestige indicators. Once they reach the top, they seem to remain there forever, despite increasingly tough competition from research universities who all vie to join the academic heavens\"\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSince its inaugural 1990 reputational survey, *Times Higher Education* has considered Berkeley to be one of the world's \"six super brands\" along with Oxford, Cambridge, Harvard, MIT, and Stanford.[113][114][115][116][117]\n\n\nBerkeley was the No. 1 recipient of National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowships between 2001 and 2010, with 1,333 awards.[79]\n\n\nThe 2010 United States National Research Council Rankings identified Berkeley as having the highest number of top-ranked doctoral programs in the nation. Berkeley doctoral programs that received a #1 ranking included English, German, Political Science, Geography, Agricultural and Resource Economics, Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, Genetics, Genomics, Epidemiology, Plant Biology, Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Civil and Environmental Engineering.[118]\n\n\n\n### Admissions and enrollment[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn his memoirs, Clark Kerr records Berkeley's rise in the rankings (according to the National Academies) during the 20th century. The school's first ranking in 1906 placed it among the top six schools (\"Big Six\") in the nation. In 1934 it ranked second, tied with Columbia and the University of Chicago, behind only Harvard; in 1957 it was ranked as the only school second to Harvard. In 1964 Berkeley was named the \"best balanced distinguished university\", meaning the school had not only the most top departments but also the highest percentage of top ranking departments in its school. The school in 1993 was the only remaining member of the original 1906 \"Big Six\", along with Harvard; in that year Berkeley ranked first.[112]\n\n\nThe American Council on Education, a private non-profit association, ranked Berkeley tenth in 1934. However, by 1942, private funding had helped Berkeley rise to second place, behind only Harvard, based on the number of distinguished departments.[44]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t1.

The issue I want to talk about tonight is the future of \"flagship\" universities, institutions like the University of Texas at Austin, or Texas A&M at College Station, or the University of California, Berkeley. This is not an easy topic to talk about for a number of reasons, not the least of which is the fact that those of us in \"systems\" of higher education are frequently actively discouraged from using the term \"flagship\" to refer to our campuses because it is seen as hurtful to the self-esteem of colleagues at other institutions in our systems.\n27. **^** \"A brief history of the University of California\".
