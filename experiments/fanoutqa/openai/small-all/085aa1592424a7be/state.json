It is the only state that borders both the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean. With a population exceeding 21 million, it is the third-most populous state in the nation and ranks eighth in population density as of 2020. It spans 65,758 square miles (170,310\u00a0km2), ranking 22nd in area among the 50 states. The Miami metropolitan area, anchored by the cities of Miami, Fort Lauderdale, and West Palm Beach, is the state's largest metropolitan area with a population of 6.138 million, and the state's most-populous city is Jacksonville with a population of 949,611. Florida's other major population centers include Tampa Bay, Orlando, Cape Coral, and the state capital of Tallahassee.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2010, undocumented immigrants constituted an estimated 5.7% of the population. This was the sixth highest percentage of any U.S. state.[160][b] There were an estimated 675,000 illegal immigrants in the state in 2010.[161] Florida has banned sanctuary cities.[162]\n\n\nAccording to HUD's 2022 Annual Homeless Assessment Report, there were an estimated 25,959 homeless people in Florida.[163][164]\n\n\n\n![](image)Ethnic origins in Florida\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nUntil the mid-20th century, Florida was the least-populous state in the southern United States. In 1900, its population was only 528,542, of whom nearly 44% were African American, the same proportion as before the Civil War.[57] Forty thousand blacks, roughly one-fifth of their 1900 population levels in Florida, left the state in the Great Migration. They left due to lynchings and racial violence and for better opportunities in the North and the West.[58] Disfranchisement for most African Americans in the state persisted until the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s gained federal legislation in 1965 to enforce protection of their constitutional suffrage.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAs of 2010, those of Hispanic or Latino ancestry accounted for 22.5% (4,223,806) of Florida's population. Out of the 22.5%, the largest groups were 6.5% (1,213,438) Cuban, and 4.5% (847,550) Puerto Rican.[151] Florida's Hispanic population includes large communities of Cuban Americans in Miami and Tampa, Puerto Ricans in Orlando and Tampa, and Mexican/Central American migrant workers. The Hispanic community continues to grow more affluent and mobile. Florida has a large and diverse Hispanic population, with Cubans and Puerto Ricans being the largest groups in the state. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n7. **^** \"U.S. Census Bureau QuickFacts Florida\".

Its economy, with a gross state product (GSP) of $1.4 trillion, is the fourth-largest of any U.S. state and the 16th-largest in the world; the main sectors are tourism, hospitality, agriculture, real estate, and transportation. Florida is world-renowned for its beach resorts, amusement parks, warm and sunny climate, and nautical recreation; attractions such as Walt Disney World, the Kennedy Space Center, and Miami Beach draw tens of millions of visitors annually. Florida is a popular destination for retirees, seasonal vacationers, and both domestic and international migrants; it hosts nine out of the ten fastest-growing communities in the U.S. The state's close proximity to the ocean has shaped its culture, identity, and daily life; its colonial history and successive waves of migration are reflected in African, European, Indigenous, Latino, and Asian influences. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAside from blacks descended from African slaves brought to the southern U.S., there are also large numbers of blacks of West Indian, recent African, and Afro-Latino immigrant origins, especially in the Miami/South Florida area.[187] Florida has the largest West Indian population of any state, originating from many Caribbean countries, with Haitian Americans being the most numerous.\n\n\nIn 2016, Florida had the highest percentage of West Indians in the United States at 4.5%, with 2.3% (483,874) from Haitian ancestry, 1.5% (303,527) Jamaican, and 0.2% (31,966) Bahamian, with the other West Indian groups making up the rest.[188]\n\n\nAs of 2010[update], those of Asian ancestry accounted for 2.4% of Florida's population.[170][171]\n\n\nAs of 2011, Florida contains the highest percentage of people over 65 (17.3%) in the U.S.[189] There were 186,102 military retirees living in the state in 2008.[190] About two-thirds of the population was born in another state, the second-highest in the U.S.[191]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAs of 2010[update], those of African ancestry accounted for 16.0% of Florida's population, which includes African Americans. Out of the 16.0%, 4.0% (741,879) were West Indian or Afro-Caribbean American.[170][171][151] During the early 1900s, black people made up nearly half of the state's population.[184] In response to segregation, disfranchisement and agricultural depression, many African Americans migrated from Florida to northern cities in the Great Migration, in waves from 1910 to 1940, and again starting in the later 1940s. They moved for jobs, better education for their children and the chance to vote and participate in society. By 1960, the proportion of African Americans in the state had declined to 18%.[185] Conversely, large numbers of northern whites moved to the state.[186] Today, large concentrations of black residents can be found throughout Florida. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n|  Largest cities or towns in FloridaSource:[149]\n |\n| --- |\n|  | Rank\n | Name | County | Municipal pop.\n | Rank\n | Name | County | Municipal pop. |  |\n| ![Jacksonville](image)Jacksonville![Miami](image)Miami | 1 | Jacksonville | Duval | 949,611 | 11 | Pembroke Pines | Broward | 171,178\n | ![Tampa](image)Tampa![Orlando](image)Orlando |\n| 2 | Miami | Miami-Dade | 442,241 | 12 | Hollywood | Broward | 153,067\n |\n| 3 | Tampa | Hillsborough | 384,959 | 13 | Gainesville | Alachua | 141,085\n |\n| 4 | Orlando | Orange | 307,573 | 14 | Miramar | Broward | 134,721\n |\n| 5 | St. Petersburg | Pinellas | 258,308 | 15 | Coral Springs | Broward | 134,394\n |\n| 6 | Hialeah | Miami-Dade | 223,109 | 16 | Palm Bay | Brevard | 119,760\n |\n| 7 | Port St. Lucie | St. Lucie | 204,851 | 17 | West Palm Beach | Palm Beach | 117,415\n |\n| 8 | Tallahassee | Leon | 196,169 | 18 | Clearwater | Pinellas | 117,292\n |\n| 9 | Cape Coral | Lee | 194,016 | 19 | Lakeland | Polk | 112,641\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Lakeland\n* Pompano Beach\n* Miami Gardens\n* Davie\n |\n| Counties | * Alachua\n* Baker\n* Bay\n* Bradford\n* Brevard\n* Broward\n* Calhoun\n* Charlotte\n* Citrus\n* Clay\n* Collier\n* Columbia\n* DeSoto\n* Dixie\n* Duval\n* Escambia\n* Flagler\n* Franklin\n* Gadsden\n* Gilchrist\n* Glades\n* Gulf\n* Hamilton\n* Hardee\n* Hendry\n* Hernando\n* Highlands\n* Hillsborough\n* Holmes\n* Indian River\n* Jackson\n* Jefferson\n* Lafayette\n* Lake\n* Lee\n* Leon\n* Levy\n* Liberty\n* Madison\n* Manatee\n* Marion\n* Martin\n* Miami\u2011Dade\n* Monroe\n* Mosquito (former county)\n* Nassau\n* Okaloosa\n* Okeechobee\n* Orange\n* Osceola\n* Palm Beach\n* Pasco\n* Pinellas\n* Polk\n* Putnam\n* Santa Rosa\n* Sarasota\n* Seminole\n* St. Johns\n* St. Lucie\n* Sumter\n* Suwannee\n* Taylor\n* Union\n* Volusia\n* Wakulla\n* Walton\n* Washington\n |\n| **![flag](image) Florida portal**\n |\n\nTemplate:Florida cities and mayors of 100,000 population\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nProtected areas of Florida\n |\n| --- |\n| \n\n| Federal level\n |\n| --- |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSee also: List of metropolitan areas of Florida, List of municipalities in Florida, and List of urbanized areas in Florida (by population)\n\nThe largest metropolitan area in the state as well as the entire southeastern United States is the Miami metropolitan area, with about 6.06\u00a0million people.
