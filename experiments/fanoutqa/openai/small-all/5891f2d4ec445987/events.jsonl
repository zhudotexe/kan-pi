He has scored over 600 senior career goals for club and country.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 19 September 2023, Lewandowski scored once in Barcelona's 5–0 home win over Antwerp in the first matchday of the 2023–24 UEFA Champions League to bring his UEFA competitions tally to 100 goals, becoming only the third player to reach such a milestone after Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi.[216][217] On 23 September, he scored a brace to help Barcelona overturn a two-goal deficit in a 3–2 home victory against Celta Vigo, becoming the best scorer in first 50 matches for the club in 21st century surpassing the record previoulsly held by Samuel Eto'o.[218]\n\n\n\n## International career[edit]\n\n\n### 2007–2013: Youth level and early international career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lewandowski taking on József Varga and Vilmos Vanczák of Hungary during a friendly match in 2011\nLewandowski began his international career with Poland under-19 in 2007.[219] He would also make three appearances for Poland's U21 team, in friendly matches against England, Belarus and Finland.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHe was also involved in Benjamin Pavard's winning goal, and was named player of the tournament.[164] On 23 February, Lewandowski opened the score in a 4–1 win against Lazio in the first leg of the Champions League round of 16, reaching his 72nd Champions League goal and surpassing Raúl as the third highest goalscorer in the competition's history.[165] On 6 March, he scored his 12th Bundesliga hat-trick in a 4–2 win over his former club Borussia Dortmund, to reach 31 goals in 23 matches.[166] On 13 March, he scored a goal in a 3–1 away win over Werder Bremen, hence he became the joint-second on the all-time Bundesliga scoring list with 268 goals along with Klaus Fischer.[167] On 20 March, he surpassed Fischer, as he scored a perfect hat-trick in the first half of a 4–0 win over VfB Stuttgart.[168]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn 15 January 2022, Lewandowski scored his 16th hat-trick and 300th Bundesliga goal in a 4–0 away win over 1. FC Köln.[186] On 8 March, Lewandowski scored a hat-trick in a 7–1 win over Red Bull Salzburg in the second leg of Champions League round of 16. Coming inside the first 23 minutes of the match, Lewandowski's hat-trick becomes the earliest ever scored by a player from the start of a Champions League match. Taking just 11 minutes from first goal to last, Lewandowski's three-goal extravaganza against Salzburg also ranks as the quickest hat-trick ever scored in the knockout phases of the Champions League. With these goals he took himself beyond the 40-goal mark in all competitions for the seventh consecutive season.[187] However, Lewandowski finished the league with 35 goals as top scorer for the fifth consecutive season and seventh outright, equaling the record of Gerd Müller. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"FIFA World Cup Russia 2018: List of Players: Poland\" (PDF).

Lewandowski has been named the VDV Bundesliga Player of the Season a record five times. He has scored over 300 goals in the Bundesliga (second-highest goalscorer of all time in Bundesliga, only behind Gerd Müller's 365 Bundesliga goals), having reached the century mark quicker than any other foreign player, and is the league's all-time leading foreign goalscorer. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Lewandowski warming up for Borussia Dortmund in 2014\nOn 27 July 2013, Lewandowski won the 2013 DFL-Supercup with Dortmund, 4–2, against Bayern Munich.[52] He scored his first goal of the season in Dortmund's 4–0 win over Augsburg in the club's opening Bundesliga match on 10 August.[53] On 1 November, he scored his only hat-trick of the season in a 6–1 Bundesliga win against VfB Stuttgart.[54]\n\n\nOn 25 February 2014, Lewandowski scored twice in the Champions League round of 16 first leg against Zenit Saint Petersburg, becoming Dortmund's overall top scorer in European competition, surpassing Stéphane Chapuisat's 16 goals.[55]\n\n\nHe scored his 100th goal for the club on his 182nd appearance, as Dortmund defeated VfL Wolfsburg 2–0 in the semi-finals of the 2013–14 DFB-Pokal on 16 April, and revealed a shirt with the number 100 during celebration.[56]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLewandowski started from where he left in the last season and once again was the top scorer in the early stages of the 2017–18 Bundesliga.
