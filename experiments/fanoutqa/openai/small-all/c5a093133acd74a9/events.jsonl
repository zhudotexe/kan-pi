All figures exclude Bouvet Island (49 km2), Jan Mayen (377 km2), and Svalbard (62,045 km2), shown separately, and the Antarctic territorial claims of *Peter I Island* (154 km2) and *Queen Maud Land* (2,700,000 km2).\n53. **^**  The total area figure is that reported by the National Institute of Statistics and Demography of Burkina Faso (INSD).[17] The water area is that reported by the Food and Agriculture Organization[18] and the land area is taken to be the difference between these two figures.\n54. **^**  The government gives the total figure as 266,838 km2.[19] CIA World Factbook has total/land area of 267,710 km2. All figures exclude the Cook Islands, Niue, and Tokelau, shown separately, as well as the Antarctic claim of Ross Dependency.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n101. **^**  The figure shown is from the CIA World Factbook,[1] and refers to land area only.

Smallest European Union member state.\n106. **^**  The total area of Saint Helena is 122 km2, Ascension Island is 88 km2, and Tristan da Cunha is 98 km2.\n107. **^**  Smallest country in Asia.\n108. **^**  Smallest country in the Americas and the Western Hemisphere.\n109. **^**  Niue, in free association with New Zealand, has limited international recognition\n110. **^**  There is a salt lake and some wetlands of unknown area.\n111. **^**  The Cook Islands, in free association with New Zealand, has limited international recognition\n112. **^**  European microstate.\n113. **^**  European microstate.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^**  The European Union is a unique supranational union. It covers a total area of 4,236,351 km2,[1] and would be ranked 7th if it were included (3.0% of world's total land area).\n2. **^**  The largest country in the world, which spans two continents, and most of northern Eurasia; with about 10.995% (about 1/9th) of the world's total landmass. Russia's European portion is roughly 4,000,000 km2, which is around 40% of the total landmass of Europe, making Russia the largest country in Europe; and its Asian portion, which covers all of Northern Asia, is around 13,100,000 km2, making Russia the largest country in Asia.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n75. **^**  The figure shown is for the Republic of Ireland; the island of Ireland is 84,421 km2.[26]\n76. **^**  Transcontinental country located in Asia and Europe. The figure shown includes the areas of Abkhazia (8,660 km2)[27] and South Ossetia (3,900 km2),[28] both *de facto* independent from Georgia.\n77. **^**  The UN gives a combined area for Svalbard and Jan Mayen as 62,422 km2.

Approx. 7% of Brazil's land is located in the Northern Hemisphere. Its Southern Hemisphere portion (approx. 7,920,000 km2) is still significantly bigger than Australia. Although the U.S. has American Samoa, Jarvis Island, and a small portion of its territorial sea south of Baker Island in the Southern Hemisphere, it is not generally regarded as a Southern Hemisphere country. Largest contiguous territory outside Eurasia.[7]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n5. **^**  The United Nations Statistics Division, the CIA World Factbook, and the Encyclopædia Britannica all rank the United States ahead of China in total area. However, the figures used by each source *include* coastal and territorial waters for the United States but *exclude* coastal and territorial waters for China. China's coastal and territorial water figures are unknown (no official publication) and thus cannot be added into China's total area figure. But Encyclopædia Britannica specifies the United States' area excluding coastal and territorial waters as 9,525,067 km2,[6] less than the figure given for China's area by any of the three sources. Therefore, while it can be determined that China has a larger area excluding coastal and territorial waters, it is unclear which country has a larger area including coastal and territorial waters.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n87. **^**  Includes the largely unrecognized but *de facto* independent Northern Cyprus (3,355 km2), the UN buffer zone (346 km2) and Akrotiri and Dhekelia (254 km2).[1]\n88. **^**  An American territory, the third-largest island of the United States after the Big Island of Hawaii and Kodiak Island of Alaska. Also the smallest part of Hispanic America.\n89. **^**  Abkhazia is claimed in whole by Georgia, and has limited international recognition\n90. **^**  Excludes claim on Adélie Land in Antarctica. The UN source has no data for the French Southern and Antarctic Lands. The figure given here is the total of all areas listed separately in the CIA World Factbook.[1]\n91. **^**  The CIA gives the areas of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip separately as 5,860 km2 and 360 km2 respectively. The figure for the West Bank includes East Jerusalem and Jerusalem No Man's Land, but excludes Mount Scopus.[1]\n92. **^**  Transnistria is claimed in whole by Moldova, and has limited international recognition\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  – | *![](image) United States Minor Outlying Islands* | 19 (7) | 19 (7) | 0 | 0 | [dn] |\n|  – | *![](image) Cocos (Keeling) Islands (Australia)* | 14 (5) | 14 (5) | 0 | 0 | [ah] |\n|  – | *![](image) Saba (NL)* | 13 (5) |  |  |  | [ca] |\n|  – | *![](image) Tokelau (New Zealand)* | 12 (5) | 12 (5) | 0 | 0 |  |\n|  – | *![](image) Gibraltar (UK)* | 6.8 (2.6) | 6.8 (2.6) | 0 | 0 | [do] |\n|  – | *![](image) Clipperton Island (France)* | 6.0 (2.3) | 2.0 (0.77) | 4.0 (1.5) | 66.7 |  |\n|  – | *![](image) Ashmore and Cartier Islands (Australia)* | 5.0 (1.9) | 5.0 (1.9) | 0 | 0 |  |\n|  – | *Spratly Islands (disputed)* | 2.0 (0.77) | 2.0 (0.77) | 0 | 0 |  |\n|  – | *![](image) Coral Sea Islands (Australia)* | 2.0 (0.77) | 2.0 (0.77) | 0 | 0 |  |\n| 194 | ![](image) Monaco | 2.0 (0.77) | 2.0 (0.77) | 0 | 0 | [dp][36] |\n| 195 | ![](image) Vatican City | 0.49 (0.19) | 0.49 (0.19) | 0 | 0 | [dq] |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Countries portal\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 7 | ![](image) India | 3,287,263 (1,269,219) | 2,973,190 (1,147,960) | 314,073 (121,264) | 9.6 | [j] |\n| 8 | ![](image) Argentina | 2,780,400 (1,073,500) | 2,736,690 (1,056,640) | 43,710 (16,880) | 1.6 | [k] |\n| 9 | ![](image) Kazakhstan | 2,724,900 (1,052,100) | 2,699,700 (1,042,400) | 25,200 (9,730) | 0.9 | [l] |\n| 10 | ![](image) Algeria | 2,381,741 (919,595) | 2,381,741 (919,595) | 0 | 0 | [m] |\n| 11 | ![](image) DR Congo | 2,345,409 (905,567) | 2,267,048 (875,312) | 77,810 (30,040) | 3.3 | [n] |\n|  – | ![Danish Realm](image) Kingdom of Denmark | 2,220,093 (857,182) | 2,220,072 (857,174) | 21 (8) | 0 | [o] |\n|  – | *![](image) Greenland* *(Denmark)* | 2,166,086 (836,330) | 2,166,086 (836,330) | 0 | 0 | [p] |\n| 12 | ![](image) Saudi Arabia | 2,149,690 (830,000) | 2,149,690 (830,000) | 0 | 0 | [q] |\n| 13 | ![](image) Mexico | 1,972,550 (761,606) | 1,943,945 (750,561) | 20,430 (7,888) | 1.0 | [r] |\n| 14 | ![](image) Indonesia | 1,904,569 (735,358) | 1,811,569 (699,450) | 93,000 (36,000) | 4.9 | [s] |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n21. **^** \"Bienvenidos al Ecuador – Geografía – Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Movilidad Humana\". *web.archive.org* (in Spanish). 26 January 2020.
