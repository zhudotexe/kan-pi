He sought to improve socio-economic equality domestically through the Scientific Development Concept, which aimed to build a \"Socialist Harmonious Society\" that was prosperous and free of social conflict.[4] In foreign policy, Hu advocated for \"China's peaceful development\", pursuing soft power in international relations and a business-oriented approach to diplomacy. Through Hu's tenure, China's influence in Africa, Latin America, and other developing countries has increased.[5] Served as General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party (2002\u20132012), Chairman of the Central Military Commission (2004\u20132012), Vice President (1998\u20132003) and Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission (1999\u20132004). |\n| 7\n | ![](image) | **Xi Jinping**\u4e60\u8fd1\u5e73(1953\u2013 )Shanghai At-large (until 2018)Inner Mongolia At-large (2018\u20132023)Jiangsu At-large (from 2023) | 14 March 2013\n | 17 March 2018\n | XII | Li Yuanchao | Himself\n |\n| 17 March 2018\n | 10 March 2023\n | XIII | Wang Qishan |\n| 10 March 2023\n | *Incumbent* | XIV | Han Zheng |\n| The fifth President under the 4th Constitution of the People's Republic of China.

His administration was known for its focus more on technocratic competence than persona.[3] At the end of his tenure after ten years in office, Hu won praise for retiring voluntarily from all positions.
