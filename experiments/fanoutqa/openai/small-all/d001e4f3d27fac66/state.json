In addition, federal laws are printed in both official languages with equal authority, and individuals have the right to receive services from the federal government in their choice of official language.\n\nIn terms of provincial languages, only in New Brunswick are both English and French official to the same extent. French is the official language of Quebec, while English is the official language of Ontario, Manitoba, and Alberta. However, government services are available in French in many regions of Ontario, Manitoba, and Alberta, particularly in regions and cities where Francophones form the majority.\n\nOverall, English and French are the most spoken languages in Canada, with English being the major language across the country except in Quebec and Nunavut. French is widely spoken in Quebec, and both languages have official status throughout Canada in respect of federal government services and most courts. Additionally, Canada is home to a rich variety of Indigenous languages, with about 100 distinct languages and dialects spoken by Indigenous communities.",

The People's Republic of China, according to its data, would be the second-largest with 17.90% of the world net wealth,[130] but is excluded because of its relatively low net wealth per adult and Human Development Index.[20] As of 2021, Cr\u00e9dit Suisse reports the G7 (without the European Union) represents around 53% of the global net wealth;[131] including the EU, the G7 accounts for over 60% of the global net wealth.[131]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nLeaders of the Group of Seven\n |\n| --- |\n| * ![Canada](image) Trudeau\n* ![France](image) Macron\n* ![Germany](image) Scholz\n* ![Italy](image) Meloni\n* ![Japan](image) Kishida\n* ![United Kingdom](image) Sunak\n* ![United States](image) Biden\n* ![European Union](image) Michel/Von\u00a0der\u00a0Leyen\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nForeign ministers of the Group of Seven\n |\n| --- |\n| * ![Canada](image) Joly\n* ![France](image) S\u00e9journ\u00e9\n* ![Germany](image) Baerbock\n* ![Italy](image) Tajani\n* ![Japan](image) Kamikawa\n* ![United Kingdom](image) Cameron\n* ![United States](image) Blinken\n* ![European Union](image) Borrell\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nFinance ministers of the Group of Seven\n |\n| --- |\n| * ![Canada](image) Freeland\n* ![France](image) Le Maire\n* ![Germany](image) Lindner\n* ![Italy](image) Giorgetti\n* ![Japan](image) Suzuki\n* ![United Kingdom](image) Hunt\n* ![United States](image) Yellen\n* ![European Union](image) Gentiloni\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLeaders of G7 members\n| Member\n | Leader(s)\n | Minister of Finance\n | Central Bank Governor\n | Party\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Canada** | Prime Minister | Justin Trudeau | Minister of Finance | Chrystia Freeland | Governor | Tiff Macklem | Liberal |\n| **France** | President | Emmanuel Macron | Minister of the Economy and Finance | Bruno Le Maire | Governor | Fran\u00e7ois Villeroy de Galhau | Renaissance |\n| **Germany** | Chancellor | Olaf Scholz | Minister of Finance | Christian Lindner | President | Joachim Nagel | SPDFDP |\n| **Italy** | Prime Minister | Giorgia Meloni | Minister of Economy and Finance | Giancarlo Giorgetti | Governor | Ignazio Visco | FdILega |\n| **Japan** | Prime Minister | Fumio Kishida | Minister of Finance | Shunichi Suzuki | Governor | Kazuo Ueda | LDP |\n| **United Kingdom** | Prime Minister | Rishi Sunak | Chancellor of the Exchequer | Jeremy Hunt | Governor | Andrew Bailey | Conservative |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Links to related articles\n |\n| --- |\n| | * v\n* t\n* e\nGroup of Seven (G7)\n |\n| --- |\n| * G6\n* G8\n* G8+5\n* G14\n |\n| Member countries | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| G7 | * ![](image)\u00a0Canada\n* ![](image)\u00a0France\n* ![](image)\u00a0Germany\n* ![](image)\u00a0Italy\n* ![](image)\u00a0Japan\n* ![](image)\u00a0United Kingdom\n* ![](image)\u00a0United States\n |\n| G8 | * ![](image)\u00a0Russia (Suspended)\n |\n| Representative | * ![](image)\u00a0European Union\n |\n| G8+5 | * G8\n* ![](image)\u00a0Brazil\n* ![](image)\u00a0China\n* ![](image)\u00a0India\n* ![](image)\u00a0Mexico\n* ![](image)\u00a0South Africa\n |\n\n |\n| Current politicians | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"What is the G7?\". *G7 UK Presidency 2021*.

Earlier, in June of that same year, the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence (GPAI) was announced. Something of a spin-out of the G7, founded by members Canada and France, GPAI's initial membership was 15, including both the EU and India, as well as Australia, Mexico, New Zealand, Singapore, Slovenia, and the Republic of Korea.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOriginating from an *ad hoc* gathering of finance ministers in 1973, the G7 has since become a formal, high-profile venue for discussing and coordinating solutions to major global issues, especially in the areas of trade, security, economics, and climate change.[4] Each member's head of government or state, along with the EU's Commission President and European Council President, meet annually at the G7 Summit; other high-ranking officials of the G7 and the EU meet throughout the year. Representatives of other states and international organizations are often invited as guests, with Russia having been a formal member (as part of the G8) from 1997 until its expulsion in 2014.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThere have been various proposals to expand the G7. The U.S.-based Atlantic Council has held the D-10 Strategy Forum since 2014 with representatives from what it calls \"leading democracies\" which support a \"rules-based democratic order\", consisting of all members of the G7 (including the European Union) plus Australia and South Korea. Several democratic countries\u00a0\u2013 including India, Indonesia, Poland, and Spain\u00a0\u2013 participate as observers.[29] Centered around a similar mandate as the G7, the D-10 has been considered by some analysts to be an alternative to the group;[30] This is also favored by various think tanks and former British leader Boris Johnson.[29]\n\n\nIn 2019 under Putin, Russia had signaled support for the inclusion of China, India, and Turkey if the G7 had reinstated Russian membership.[31]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn subsequent years, the G7 has faced several geopolitical challenges that have led some international analysts to question its credibility,[62] or propose its replacement by the G20.[63] On 2 March 2014, the G7 condemned the Russian Federation for its \"violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine\" through its military intervention.[64] The group also announced its commitment to \"mobilize rapid technical assistance to support Ukraine in addressing its macroeconomic, regulatory and anti-corruption challenges\", while adding that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) was best suited to stabilizing the country's finances and economy.[64]\n\n\n\n![G7 is located in Japan](image)![5th, 12th, 19th](image)\n5th, 12th, 19th\n![26th](image)\n26th\n![34th](image)\n34th\n![42nd](image)\n42nd\n![49th](image)\n49th\nclass=notpageimage|\nHost venues of G7 summits in Japan\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n108. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"The Charlevoix G7 Summit Communique\". *Reuters*. 9 June 2018.\n109. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"G7 Summit in Brussels, 4\u20135 June 2014: Background note and facts about the EU's role and action\". 3 June 2014.

It is organized through a presidency that rotates annually among the member states, with the presiding state setting the group's priorities and hosting the summit; Japan presides for 2023.[5] While lacking a legal or institutional basis, the G7 is widely considered to wield significant international influence;[6] it has catalyzed or spearheaded several major global initiatives, including efforts to combat the HIV/AIDS pandemic, provide financial aid to developing countries, and address climate change through the 2015 Paris Agreement.[6][1][7] However, the group has been criticized by observers for its allegedly outdated and limited membership, narrow global representation, and ineffectualness.[8][9][10]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Origins[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nDefence ministers of the Group of Seven\n |\n| --- |\n| * ![](image) Blair\n* ![](image) Lecornu\n* ![](image) Pistorius\n* ![](image) Crosetto\n* ![](image) Kihara\n* ![](image) Shapps\n* ![](image) Austin\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nInterior ministers of the Group of Seven\n |\n| --- |\n| * ![Canada](image) LeBlanc\n* ![France](image) Darmanin\n* ![Germany](image) Faeser\n* ![Italy](image) Piantedosi\n* ![Japan](image) Suzuki\n* ![United Kingdom](image) Cleverly\n* ![United States](image) Mayorkas\n* ![European Union](image) Johansson\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nJustice ministers of the Group of Seven\n |\n| --- |\n| * ![](image) Virani\n* ![](image) Dupond-Moretti\n* ![](image) Buschmann\n* ![](image) Nordio\n* ![](image) Koizumi\n* ![](image) Chalk\n* ![](image) Garland\n* ![](image) Reynders\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n60. **^** \"G7 agrees global rescue plan\". *The Guardian*. 10 October 2008.

However, the reserve system created more permanent stationary bands, which have generally selected only one of their various ancestral languages to try to preserve in the face of increasing Anglicization, Francization,[65] or Amslanization (the process by which American Sign Language replaces local sign languages).[66] In addition, the residential school system attempted to institutionally exterminate languages and cultures from coast to coast to coast. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSource: Statistics Canada, *Mother tongue by age (Total), 2016 counts for the population excluding institutional residents of Canada, provinces and territories, 2016 Census* .[14]\n\n## Knowledge of languages[edit]\n\n\n| Top ten spoken languages in Canada  2021 census[b] |\n| --- |\n| Language |  | Percent |\n| English |  | 87.06% |\n| French |  | 29.08% |\n| Chinese[c] |  | 4.21% |\n| Hindustani[d] |  | 3.24% |\n| Spanish |  | 3.22% |\n| Punjabi |  | 2.59% |\n| Arabic |  | 2.31% |\n| Tagalog |  | 2.03% |\n| Italian |  | 1.51% |\n| German |  | 1.15% |\n\nThe question on knowledge of languages allows for multiple responses, and first appeared on the 1991 Canadian census.[e] The following figures are from the 1991 Canadian census, 2001 Canadian census, 2011 Canadian census, and the 2021 Canadian census. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n1996: Statistics Canada.

French can be used in some lower courts and education is offered in both languages, but the bureaucracy functions almost solely in English. Therefore, although Alberta is not officially an English-only province, English has a higher *de facto* status than French.

French, a Gallo-Romance language, is spoken by nearly the entire population of France.\n\n\nIn addition to French, several regional languages are also spoken to varying degrees, such as Alsatian, a Germanic dialect (specifically Alemannic) (spoken by 1.44% of the national population); Basque, a language isolate; Breton, a Celtic language (spoken by 0.61%); Corsican, an Italo-Dalmatian language; and various other Gallo-Romance languages (Langues d'O\u00efl 1.25%, Occitan 1.33%). Some of these languages are also spoken in neighbouring countries, such as Belgium, Germany, Switzerland, Italy or Spain.\n\n\n\n\n## Status[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Language policy in France\n\nThe official language of the French Republic is French (art. 2 of the French Constitution) and the French government is, by law, compelled to communicate primarily in French. The government, furthermore, mandates that commercial advertising be available in French (though it can also use other languages). The French government, however, does not mandate the use of French by private individuals or corporations or in any other media.\n\n\nA revision of the French constitution creating official recognition of regional languages was implemented by the Parliament in Congress at Versailles in July 2008.[4]\n\n\nThe 1999 Report written for the government by Bernard Cerquiglini identified 75 languages that would qualify for recognition under the government's proposed ratification of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. Of those languages, 24 are indigenous to the European territory of the state while all the others are from overseas areas of the French Republic (in the Caribbean, Indian Ocean, Pacific Ocean and South America).\n\n\nAlthough ratification was blocked by the Constitutional Council as contradicting the Fifth Republic's constitutional provision enshrining French as the language of the Republic, the government continues to recognise regional and minority languages to a limited extent (i.e. without granting them official status) and the *D\u00e9l\u00e9gation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00e0 la langue fran\u00e7aise* has acquired the additional function of observing and studying the languages of France and has had *et aux langues de France* added to its title. The category of *languages of France* (in French: *langues de France*) is thus administratively recognised even if this does not go so far as to provide any official status. Following his election as president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande reasserted in 2012 his campaign platform to ratify the European Charter and ensure a clear legal framework for regional languages (within a programme of administrative decentralisation that would give competencies to the regions in language policy).[5]\n\n\nThe regional languages of France are sometimes called *patois*, but this term (roughly meaning \"dialects\") is often considered derogatory. *Patois* is used to refer to supposedly purely oral languages,[*citation needed*] but this does not, for instance, take into account that Occitan was already being written at a time when French was not and its literature has continued to thrive, with a Nobel Prize for Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mistral in 1904.\n\n\nIt is estimated that at the time of the French Revolution in 1789, only half of the population of France could speak French, and as late as 1871 only a quarter spoke French as their native language.[6]\n\n\n\n### Language education[edit]\n\n\nThe topic of the teaching of regional languages in public primary and secondary schools is controversial. Proponents of the measure state that it would be necessary for the preservation of those languages and to show respect to the local culture. Opponents contend that local languages are often non-standardised (thus making curricula difficult), of dubious practical usefulness (since most are spoken by a small number of people, without any sizable corpus of publications) and that the curriculum and funding of public schools are already too strained. The topic also leads to wider controversial questions of autonomy of the *r\u00e9gions*. Regarding other languages, English, Spanish, Italian and German are the most commonly studied foreign languages in French schools.\n\n\nIn April 2001, the Minister of Education, Jack Lang,[7] stated formally that for more than two centuries, the political powers of the French government had repressed regional languages,[*citation needed*] and announced that bilingual education would, for the first time, be recognised, and bilingual teachers recruited in French public schools.\n\n\n\n### Cross-border languages[edit]\n\n\nSome of the languages of France are also cross-border languages (for example, Basque, Catalan, Corsican, Dutch, Franc-Comtois, Franco-Proven\u00e7al, Norman, Picard, Occitan and others), some of which enjoy a recognised or official status in the respective neighbouring state or territory. French itself is also a cross-border language, being spoken in neighbouring Andorra, Belgium, Italy, Luxembourg, Monaco, and Switzerland.\n\n\n\n## List of languages[edit]\n\n\nMother tongues of the French population (2007 AES)\n\n\n\nFrench (87.2%)\nArabic (3.6%)\nPortuguese (1.5%)\nSpanish (1.2%)\nItalian (1.0%)\nGerman (0.7%)\nTurkish (0.5%)\nEnglish (0.4%)\nOther languages (3.9%)\nAccording to the 2007 Adult Education survey, part of a project by the European Union and carried in France by the Insee and based on a sample of 15,350 people, French was the mother tongue of 87.2% of the total population, or roughly 55.81\u00a0million people, followed by Arabic (3.6%, 2.3\u00a0million), Portuguese (1.5%, 960,000), Spanish (1.2%, 770,000) and Italian (1.0%, 640,000).

One of the questions was about the languages that their parents spoke with them before the age of five. This is the first time serious statistics were computed about the proportion of mother tongues in France. The results were published in *Enqu\u00eate familiale, Insee, 1999*.[9][*citation needed*]\n\n\nHere is a list of the nine most prominent mother tongues in France based on *Enqu\u00eate familiale*.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Rank\n | Language\n | Mother tongue\n | Percentage of adult population\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | French | 39,360,000\n | 86% (note that this figure is an underestimate because people under 18 years of age were not surveyed; see note #2 below the table)\n |\n| 2\n | German dialects (Alsatian, Lorraine Franconian, etc.)\n | 970,000 (of whom Alsatian: 660,000; standard German: 210,000; Lorraine Franconian: 100,000)\n | 2.12% (of whom Alsatian: 1.44%; standard German: 0.46%; Lorraine Franconian: 0.22%)\n |\n| 3\n | Maghrebi Arabic | 940,000\n | 2.05%\n |\n| 4\n | Occitan (Languedocian, Gascon, Proven\u00e7al, etc.)\n | 610,000 (another 1,060,000 had some exposure)\n | 1.33% (another 2.32% had some exposure, see notes)\n |\n| 5\n | Portuguese | 580,000\n | 1.27%\n |\n| 6\n | O\u00efl languages (Picard, Gallo, Poitevin, Saintongeais, etc.)\n | 570,000 (another 850,000 had some exposure)\n | 1.25% (another 1.86% had some exposure, see notes)\n |\n| 7\n | Italian, Corsican and Ligurian (Monegasque)\n | 540,000\n | 1.19%\n |\n| 8\n | Spanish | 485,000\n | 1.06%\n |\n| 9\n | Breton | 280,000 (another 405,000 had some exposure)\n | 0.61% (another 0.87% had some exposure, see notes)\n |\n| 10\n | About 400 other languages: Polish, Berber languages, East Asian languages, Catalan, Franco-Proven\u00e7al, Basque, West Flemish, etc., as well as those who gave no response\n | 2,350,000 (of whom English: 115,000)\n | 5.12% (of whom English: 0.25% of total adult population)\n |\n|  | **Total** | 45,762,000 (46,680,000 including those with two mother tongues who were counted twice)\n | 102% (2% of people have both French and another language as their mother tongue, thus, they are counted twice)\n |\n\n\nWhen the people with mother tongue and people with some exposure to the language before the age of five (see note #3 below) are added together, the five most widely spoken languages in metropolitan France are (note that the percentages add up to more than 100, because many bilingual people are now counted twice):\n\n\n\n* French: 42,100,000 (92%)\n* Occitan: 1,670,000 (3.65%)\n* German and German dialects: 1,440,000 (3.15%)\n* O\u00efl languages (excl. French): 1,420,000 (3.10%)\n* Arabic: 1,170,000 (2.55%)\n\n\n#### Notes on the table[edit]\n\n\n1. The data in the table are about **mother tongues**, and not about actual language practice. It states that 14% of the adult people living in France in 1999 were born and raised up to the age of 5 in families that spoke only (or predominantly) some other languages than French. It does not mean that 14% of adult people in France spoke some other languages than French in 1999.\n2. Only adults (i.e. 18 years and older) were surveyed. This means that French people born between 1981 and 1999 are not included in the survey. The mother tongue of the younger generations is more predominantly French than is the case with the older generations because, as the *Enqu\u00eate familiale* survey explains, regional and immigrant language transmission decreases dramatically with each new generation, as French replaces the regional and immigrant languages. In the *Enqu\u00eate familiale* survey, only 35% of parents whose mother tongue was a regional or immigrant language reported that they spoke that language to their children. Thus, the 86% figure of people with French as their mother tongue is an underestimate because the younger generations whose predominant mother tongue is French are not counted.\n3. The concept of \"mother tongue\" may not give a complete idea of the phenomenon of minority languages in France. This is because there are many people who were born and raised in families in which parents spoke to them only (or predominantly) French, but in which some regional or immigration languages were also occasionally used. One example: while the data shows that 610,000 adults in 1999 had one of the Occitan dialects as their mother tongue, the survey also found out that another 1,060,000 adults were born and raised in families in which one of the Occitan dialects was occasionally spoken. Some of these 1,060,000 people may speak Occitan as fluently as the 610,000 people who have it as a mother tongue, while some other (the majority, probably) have only a limited knowledge of Occitan. That 1,670,000 adults are speakers of Occitan cannot be corroborated, but it may be the case that the total number of people with some form of exposure to Occitan is higher than the 610,000 figure, though some of may have stopped using the language altogether since then.\n\n\n### *Ethnologue*, Metropolitan France[edit]\n\n\nThe following languages are listed as having 50,000 or more total speakers in Metropolitan France according to the 2022 edition of *Ethnologue*.[15] Entries identified by *Ethnologue* as macrolanguages (such as Arabic, Persian, Malay, Pashto, and Chinese, encompassing all their respective varieties) are not included in this section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguages of Metropolitan France, *Ethnologue* (25th ed., 2022)[a][15]\n| Language\n | Family | Branch\n | First-language (L1)speakers in France\n | Second-language (L2)speakers in France\n | Total (L1+L2)speakers in France\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Alsacian | Indo-European | Germanic |  |  | 900,000\n |\n| Algerian Arabic | Afro-Asiatic | Semitic |  |  | 1,350,000\n |\n| Moroccan Arabic | Afro-Asiatic | Semitic |  |  | 1,140,000\n |\n| Tunisian Arabic | Afro-Asiatic | Semitic |  |  | 447,000\n |\n| Western Armenian | Indo-European | Armenian |  |  | 70,000\n |\n| Arpitan | Indo-European | Romance |  |  | 150,000\n |\n| Basque | Isolate | \u2014\n |  |  | 72,000\n |\n| Breton | Indo-European | Celtic |  |  | 206,000\n |\n| Catalan | Indo-European | Romance |  |  | 126,000\n |\n| Corsican | Indo-European | Romance |  |  | 150,000\n |\n| English | Indo-European | Germanic | 236,000\n | 26,200,000\n | 26,436,000\n |\n| French | Indo-European | Romance | 62,400,000\n | 1,500,000\n | 63,900,000\n |\n| French Sign Language | Francosign | \u2014\n |  |  | 100,000\n |\n| Standard German | Indo-European | Germanic |  | 4,000,000\n | 4,000,000\n |\n| Italian | Indo-European | Romance |  |  | 829,000\n |\n| Kabyle | Afro-Asiatic | Berber |  |  | 537,000\n |\n| Khmer | Austroasiatic | Mon\u2013Khmer |  |  | 50,000\n |\n| Lesser Antillean French Creole | Indo-European | Romance |  |  | 150,000\n |\n| Lorraine Franconian | Indo-European | Germanic |  |  | 400,000\n |\n| Occitan | Indo-European | Romance |  |  | 110,000\n |\n| Picard | Indo-European | Romance |  |  | 500,000\n |\n| Portuguese | Indo-European | Romance |  |  | 959,000\n |\n| Spanish | Indo-European | Romance | 461,000\n | 5,990,000\n | 6,451,000\n |\n| Central Atlas Tamazight | Afro-Asiatic | Berber |  |  | 150,000\n |\n| Tamil | Dravidian | Southern\n |  |  | 125,000\n |\n| Turkish | Turkic | Oghuz |  |  | 444,000\n |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Culture of France\n* Francophonie\n* French language in Canada\n* Gaulish\n* History of French\n* Languages of the European Union\n* Law French\n* Old Frankish\n* Old French\n* Old Occitan\n* Ordinance of Villers-Cotter\u00eats\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Only languages with at least 50,000 speakers are shown.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Europeans and their Languages\" (PDF).

Recognized minority languages have official status as well, usually in their respective regions.\n\n\n\n\n## Language spoken at home[edit]\n\n\nNeither the 1987 West German census nor the 2011 census inquired about language. Starting with the 2017 microcensus (a survey with a sampling fraction of 1% of the persons and households in Germany that supplies basic sociodemographic data and facilitates ongoing monitoring of the labor market), a question asking, \"Which language is spoken predominantly in your household?\" was added,[4] nearly eighty years since the 1939 Census asked for the mother tongue of the population.[5]\n\n\nAccording to a 2023 Pew Research survey, the most commonly spoken languages at home were:[6]\n\n\n\n* German (90% of households)\n* Turkish (2% of households)\n* Arabic (1% of households)\n* Other (6% of households)\n\n\nThe questionnaire did not distinguish Standard German from German dialects.[7]\n\n\n\n## German dialects[edit]\n\n\n![](image)German dialect area around 1900, defined as all West Germanic varieties using Standard German as their literary language:[8][9][10][11] Low Franconian\n Frisian\n Low Saxon or Low German\n Middle German\n High German\n\nMain article: German dialects\n\nThe German language area is characterized by a range of different dialects.[12] There is a written and spoken standard language but there are also large differences in the usage of the standard and the local dialects.[12] The flight and expulsion of Germans broke down the isolation of dialect areas. In 1959, 20% of West Germans were expellees or refugees.[13] The colloquial speech is a compromise between Standard German and the dialect.[13] Northern Germany (the Low German area) is characterized by a loss of dialects: standard German is the vernacular, with very few regional features even in informal situations.[12] In Central Germany (the Middle German area) there is a tendency towards dialect loss.[12] In Southern Germany (the Upper German area) dialects are still in use.[12] Dialects are declining in all regions except for Bavaria.[12] In 2008, 45% of Bavarians claimed to use only Bavarian in everyday communication.[14]\n\n\n\n## Minority languages[edit]\n\n\nRecognized minority languages include:[3][15]\n\n\n\n* Romani (0.8%)\n* Danish (0.06%)\n* North Frisian (0.01%) and Saterland Frisian\n* Upper Sorbian and Lower Sorbian (0.01%)\n\n\n### European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages[edit]\n\n\nGermany ratified the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages on 16 September 1998 for the following languages in respect of specific L\u00e4nder:[16]\n\n\n\n* Romani (across Germany)\n* Danish (in Schleswig-Holstein)\n* Low German (part III in Bremen, Hamburg, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Lower Saxony and Schleswig-Holstein); (part II in Brandenburg, Northrhine-Westphalia and Saxony-Anhalt)\n* North Frisian (in Schleswig-Holstein)\n* Saterland Frisian (in Lower Saxony)\n* Upper Sorbian (in the Free State of Saxony)\n* Lower Sorbian (in Brandenburg)\n\n\n## Immigrant languages[edit]\n\n\nImmigrant languages spoken by sizable[*clarification needed*] communities of first and second-generation (dominant origin of the speakers in brackets):\n\n\n\n* Turkish (southern Europe and Western Asia) c. 1.8%[3]\n* Kurdish (Western Asia) c. 0.3%[3]\n* Tamil (South Asia and Southeast Asia)[17]\n* Russian (eastern Europe and Northern Asia) c. 2.6%[18]\n* Ukrainian (eastern Europe)\n* Arabic (Western Asia and North Africa)\n* Greek (southern Europe)\n* Dutch (Western Europe)\n* Polish (central Europe)\n* Serbo-Croatian (Western Balkans, southern Europe)\n* Italian (southern Europe)\n* Portuguese (southern Europe)\n* Lithuanian (Baltic Region)\n\n\n## Second languages[edit]\n\n\nAt least 81% of the German primary and secondary students were learning English as their first foreign language in 2017.[19] However, German schoolchildren generally do not speak English as proficiently as their Scandinavian counterparts[20] and, in some cases, French or Latin are taught first.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAccording to a 2020 analysis conducted by Pew Research Center using 2017 data from Eurostat, the most popular non-English foreign languages learned in German primary and secondary schools were French (15%), Spanish (5%) and Russian (1%), with others garnering less than 1% each.[19] During the existence of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany, 1949\u20131990), the most common second language taught there was Russian, while English and French were the preferred second languages taught in schools in the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany).[21]\n\n\nSeveral bilingual kindergartens and schools exist in Germany offering education in German and English, French, Spanish, Japanese, Turkish, and other languages.[22]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* German language in the Basic Law\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Europeans and their Languages\". 2012.

In parallel, many Italians also communicate in one of the local languages, most of which, like Tuscan, are indigenous evolutions of Vulgar Latin. Some local languages do not stem from Latin, however, but belong to other Indo-European branches, such as Cimbrian (Germanic), Arb\u00ebresh (Albanian), Slavomolisano (Slavic) and Griko (Greek). Other non-indigenous languages are spoken by a substantial percentage of the population due to immigration.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* NavigAIS Archived 11 December 2016 at the Wayback Machine Online version of the *Sprach- und Sachatlas Italiens und der S\u00fcdschweiz (AIS) (Linguistic and Ethnographic Atlas of Italy and Southern Switzerland)*\n* An interactive map of languages and dialects in Italy\n* Ethnologue - Languages of Italy\n* Rivista Etnie, linguistica\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n![Italy](image) Languages of Italy\n |\n| --- |\n| *Historical linguistic minorities*: Albanian, Catalan, Croatian, French, Franco-Proven\u00e7al, Friulian, Germanic, Greek, Ladin, Occitan, Romani, Sardinian, Slovene, Wenzhounese\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Italo-Romance | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Ligurian | * Brigasc\n* Genoese\n* Intemelio\n* Mon\u00e9gasque\n* Royasc\n* Tabarchino\n |\n| Lombard | * Western Lombard\n\t+ Brianz\u00f6\u00f6 dialects\n\t\t- Canz\u00e9s\n\t+ Bustocco and Legnanese\n\t+ Comasco-Lecchese dialects\n\t\t- Comasco\n\t\t- Lagh\u00e9e\n\t\t- Vallassinese\n\t\t- Lecchese\n\t+ Milanese\n\t+ Ticinese\n\t\t- Ossolano\n\t+ Varesino\n\t+ Southwestern Lombard\n\t\t- Pavese\n\t\t- Novarese\n\t\t- Cremun\u00e9s\n\t+ Spasell\n* Eastern Lombard\n\t+ Bergamasque\n\t+ Cremish\n |\n| Emilian\u2013Romagnol | * Emilian\n\t+ Bolognese\n\t+ Parmigiano\n* Romagnol\n\t+ Forlivese\n |\n| Other Gallo-Italiclanguages | * Gallo-Italic of Basilicata\n* Gallo-Italic of Sicily\n* Judeo-Italian\n* Judaeo-Piedmontese\n* Piedmontese\n |\n\n |\n| Venetian[a] | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Venetian | * Fiuman\n* Triestine\n |\n\n |\n| Rhaeto-Romance | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Rhaeto-Romance | * Friulian\n* Ladin\n\t+ Cadorino\n\t+ Fornes\n\t+ Nones\n |\n\n |\n\n | * ![flag](image)Italy portal\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Albanian | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nItalian was first declared to be Italy's official language during the Fascist period, more specifically through the R.D.l., adopted on 15 October 1925, with the name of *Sull'Obbligo della lingua italiana in tutti gli uffici giudiziari del Regno, salvo le eccezioni stabilite nei trattati internazionali per la citt\u00e0 di Fiume*.[23]\n\n\nThe original Italian constitution does not explicitly express that Italian is the official national language.

Apart from Standard Italian, these languages are often referred to as *dialetti* \"dialects\", both colloquially and in scholarly usage; however, the term may coexist with other labels like \"minority languages\" or \"vernaculars\" for some of them.[14] The label \"dialect\" may be understood erroneously to imply that the native languages spoken in Italy are \"dialects\" of Standard Italian in the prevailing English-language sense of \"varieties or variations of a language\".[15][16] This is not the case in Italy, as the country's long-standing linguistic diversity does not actually stem from Standard Italian. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOne common classification divides these languages into two groups:\n\n\n\n* The Italo-Dalmatian languages, including Neapolitan and Sicilian, as well as the Sardinian-influenced Sassarese and Gallurese which are sometimes grouped with Sardinian but are actually of southern Corsican origin.\n* The Sardinian language, usually listed as a group of its own with two main Logudorese and Campidanese orthographic forms.\n\n\nAll of these languages are considered conservative relative to the Romance languages as a whole, with Sardinian being the most conservative of them all.\n\n\n\n## Mother tongues of foreign citizens in Italy[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Language (2018)[74][75] | Population\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Romanian | 806.938\n |\n| Albanian | 441,027\n |\n| Arabic | 420,980\n |\n| Chinese | 299,823\n |\n| Spanish | 285,664\n |\n| Ukrainian | 239,424\n |\n| Filipino | 168,292\n |\n| Italian | 162,148\n |\n| Others | 892,283\n |\n\n\n## Standardised written forms[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOf the indigenous languages, twelve are officially recognized as spoken by linguistic minorities: Albanian, Catalan, German, Greek, Slovene, Croatian, French, Franco-Proven\u00e7al, Friulian, Ladin, Occitan and Sardinian;[7] at the present moment, Sardinian is regarded as the largest of such groups, with approximately one million speakers, even though the Sardophone community is overall declining.[8][9][10][11][12][13] However, full bilingualism (*bilinguismo perfetto*) is legally granted only to the three national minorities whose mother tongue is German, Slovene or French, and enacted in the regions of Trentino-Alto Adige, Friuli Venezia Giulia and the Aosta Valley, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n## Language or dialect[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Regional Italian\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Northern Italian languages are conventionally defined as those Romance languages spoken north of the La Spezia\u2013Rimini Line, which runs through the northern Apennine Mountains just to the north of Tuscany; however, the dialects of Occitan and Franco-Proven\u00e7al spoken in the extreme northwest of Italy (e.g. the Vald\u00f4tain in the Aosta Valley) are generally excluded. The classification of these languages is difficult and not agreed-upon, due both to the variations among the languages and to the fact that they share isoglosses of various sorts with both the Italo-Romance languages to the south and the Gallo-Romance languages to the northwest.\n\n\n\n![](image)\nAlemannic\n\nAlpine  \nProven\u00e7al\n\nBavarian\n\nCimbrian\n\nEmilian-Romagnol\n\nFrancoproven\u00e7al\n\nFriulian\n\nLadin\n\nLigurian\n\nLombard\n\nM\u00f3cheno\n\nPiedmontese\n\nResian\n\nT\u00f6itschu\n\nVenetian\n\n  \n\nOne common classification divides these languages into four groups:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n### Recognition by the Italian state[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Communities recognized by Italy as historical linguistic minorities.[25][26]\n\n> The Republic safeguards linguistic minorities by means of appropriate measures.\n> \n> \u2014\u200aItalian Constitution, Art. 6\n> \n\n\nArt. 6 of the Italian Constitution was drafted by the Founding Fathers to show sympathy for the country's historical linguistic minorities, in a way for the newly founded Republic to let them become part of the national fabric and distance itself from the Italianization policies promoted earlier because of nationalism, especially during Fascism.[27][28][29] Since 1934, Minister Francesco Ercole had excluded in fact from the school curriculum any language other than Italian, in accordance with the policy of linguistic nationalism.[30]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n### Non-Romance languages[edit]\n\n\n#### Albanian, Slavic, Greek and Romani languages[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Language\n | Family\n | ISO 639-3\n | Dialects spoken in Italy\n | Notes\n | Speakers\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Arb\u00ebresh | Albanian | Tosk |  |  | aae | . | recognized as a variant of the Albanian strain by UNESCO[64] | 100,000\n |\n| Serbo-Croatian | Slavic | South | Western |  | hbs | Molise Croatian |  | 1,000\n |\n| Slovene (*sloven\u0161\u010dina*) | Slavic | South | Western |  | slv | Gai Valley dialect; Resian; Torre Valley dialect; Natisone Valley dialect; Brda dialect; Karst dialect; Inner Carniolan dialect; Istrian dialect |  | 100,000\n |\n| Italiot Greek | Hellenic (Greek) | Attic |  |  | ell | Griko (Salento); Calabrian Greek |  | 20,000\n |\n| Romani | Indo-Iranian | Indo-Aryan | Central Zone | Romani | rom | By ISO 639-3 classification, Sinte Romani is the individual language most present in Italy in the Romany macrolanguage |  |  |\n\n\n#### High German languages[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAlthough \"[al]most all Italian dialects were being written in the Middle Ages, for administrative, religious, and often artistic purposes,\"[76] use of local language gave way to stylized Tuscan, eventually labeled Italian.

The classification of the Romance languages of Italy is controversial, and listed here are two of the generally accepted classification systems.\n\n\n\n### Romance languages[edit]\n\n\nLoporcaro[68] proposes a classification of Romance languages of Italy based on Pellegrini,[69] who groups different Romance languages according to areal and some typological features.

Along with Japanese, these languages are part of the Japonic language family, but they are separate languages,[*citation needed*] and are not mutually intelligible with Japanese, or with each other. All of the spoken Ryukyuan languages are classified by UNESCO as endangered.\n\n\nIn Hokkaid\u014d, there is the Ainu language, which is spoken by the Ainu people, who are the indigenous people of the island. The Ainu languages, of which Hokkaid\u014d Ainu is the only extant variety, are isolated and do not fall under any language family. Ever since the Meiji period, Japanese has become widely used among the Ainu people and consequently Ainu languages have been classified critically endangered by UNESCO.[2]\n\n\nIn addition, languages such as Orok, Evenki and Nivkh spoken in formerly Japanese controlled southern Sakhalin are becoming more and more endangered. After the Soviet Union took control of the region, speakers of these languages and their descendants migrated to mainland Japan and still exist in small numbers.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nNot until shortly after the turn of the second century did indications of language appear in Chinese texts. Chinese characters were adopted and records of spoken language were made in Japan. Hiragana and Katakana characters were incorporated as a relatively accurate way to represent the sounds of Chinese characters.\n\n\n\n### Ry\u016bky\u016ban languages[edit]\n\n\nChinese characters were first introduced to Ry\u016bky\u016ban languages shortly into the 13th-century. Details concerning the language before then are not well known. 14th-century records indicate that gifts from Ry\u016bky\u016b Islands to China used Hiragana, which indicates that these languages were tied to Mainland Japanese at the time.\n\n\n\n### Ainu languages[edit]\n\n\nHistory records that people in Hokkaid\u014d, Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands spoke Ainu languages,[*citation needed*] but there are also places in and around T\u014dhoku whose names derive from Ainu languages. According to 16th-century records, Ainu languages had no written form.[*citation needed*] Only from the 19th-century did the Ainu languages begin to use Katakana.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Orok language[edit]\n\n\nRecords show that the Orok language was spoken during the latter part of the Edo period in Hokkaid\u014d,[*dubious \u2013 discuss*] Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands;[*dubious \u2013 discuss*] however, there are only a few speakers still in existence.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Nivkh language[edit]\n\n\nLike Orok, the Nivkh language was spoken in Sakhalin and later in Hokkaid\u014d,[*citation needed*] and the Kuril Islands.[*dubious \u2013 discuss*] It is unknown whether speakers of Nivkh still remain in Japan.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### European languages[edit]\n\n\nSince the Middle Ages, owing to visits from Europeans, Japanese has adopted a number of foreign words.\n\n\nPost-1543 Portuguese was the initial contact language with Europeans, but this was later replaced by Dutch after the Japanese removed Portuguese people from the country.[3] The Japanese government conducted negotiations with Western authorities in Dutch until around 1870.[4] Since then English became the primary language of interaction with Western countries.\n\n\n\n## Language classifications[edit]\n\n\nThe oral languages spoken by the native peoples of the insular country of Japan at present and during recorded history belong to either of two primary phyla of human language:\n\n\n\n* Japonic languages\n\t+ Japanese language (See also Japanese dialects)\n\t\t- Hachij\u014d Japanese\n\t\t- Eastern Japanese\n\t\t- Western Japanese\n\t\t- Ky\u016bsh\u016b Japanese\n\t+ Ry\u016bky\u016ban languages\n\t\t- Northern Ry\u016bky\u016ban languages\n\t\t\t* Amami\n\t\t\t* Kunigami\n\t\t\t* Okinawa\n\t\t- Southern Ry\u016bky\u016ban languages\n\t\t\t* Miyako\n\t\t\t* Yaeyama\n\t\t\t* Yonaguni\n* Ainu languages\n\t+ Hokkaid\u014d Ainu language\n\t+ Sakhalin Ainu language (extinct)\n\t+ Kuril Ainu language (extinct)\n\n\nIn addition to these two indigenous language families, there is Japanese Sign Language, as well as significant minorities of ethnic Koreans and Chinese, who make up respectively about 0.5% and 0.4% of the country's population and many of whom continue to speak their ethnic language in private (see Zainichi Korean). There is also a notable history of use of *Kanbun* (Classical Chinese) as a language of literature and diplomacy in Japan, similar to the status of the Latin language in medieval Europe, which has left an indelible mark on the vocabulary of the Japanese language. *Kanbun* is a mandatory subject in the curricula of most Japanese secondary schools.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Demographics of Japan\n* Japanese people\n\t+ Yamato people\n\t+ Ryukyuan people\n\t+ Ainu people\n* Koreans in Japan\n* Chinese in Japan\n* Brazilians in Japan\n* Classical Chinese as a literary language of Japan\n* East Asian languages\n* Deafness in Japan\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"\u53c2\u8b70\u9662\u6cd5\u5236\u5c40\".\n2. **^** Ertl, John, ed.

Regional indigenous languages are Scots and Ulster Scots and the Celtic languages, Irish, Scottish Gaelic, Welsh and, as a revived language with few speakers, Cornish. British Sign Language is also used. There are also many languages spoken by immigrants who arrived recently to the United Kingdom, mainly within inner city areas; these languages are mainly from continental Europe and South Asia.[15]\n\n\nThe *de facto* official language of the United Kingdom is English.[16] Additionally, Welsh is a *de jure* official language in Wales.[17][18] Welsh is spoken by 538,300 people in Wales according to the 2021 census.[19] Approximately 124,000 people speak Irish in Northern Ireland, which is an official language in Northern Ireland alongside English.[20]\n\n\n\n\n## List of languages and dialects[edit]\n\n\n### Living[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOverview of the languages spoken in the United Kingdom\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Languages of the United Kingdom |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)Multilingual sign in London\n |\n| Main | English (98%;[1] national and *de facto* official)[a][2][3][4] |\n| Minority | Scots\u00a0(2.5%),[5] Welsh\u00a0(1.3%),[6] Cornish \u00a0(<0.01% L2),[7][8][9] Scottish Gaelic, Irish,[a] Ulster Scots (0.05%),[10] Angloromani, Beurla Reagaird, Shelta |\n| Immigrant | Polish, Punjabi, Hindi\u2013Urdu, Bengali, Gujarati, Arabic, French, Chinese, Portuguese, Spanish, Tamil[11] |\n| Foreign | French\u00a0(23%), German\u00a0(9%), Spanish\u00a0(8%)[b][12] |\n| Signed | British Sign Language,\u00a0(0.002%)[c][13] Irish Sign Language, Signed English, Northern Ireland Sign Language |\n| Keyboard\u00a0layout | British QWERTY![](image)\n |\n| a.**^** Statistics indicate respondents who can speak at least \"well\".b.**^** Statistics indicate respondents with at least basic ability.c.**^** Statistics undertaken with assumptions and large disparities between home countries.\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nLanguages of the United Kingdom\n |\n| --- |\n| Official language | English\n |\n| Recognised regional languages | * Cornish\n* Irish\n* Manx\n* Norman\n\t+ *Auregnais*\n\t+ Guern\u00e9siais\n\t+ J\u00e8rriais\n\t+ Sercquiais\n* Scots\n\t+ Ulster Scots\n* Scottish Gaelic\n* Welsh\n |\n| Other languages | * Angloromani\n* Beurla Reagaird\n* *Cumbric*\n* Llanito\n* *Norn*\n* *Pictish*\n* Scottish Cant\n* Shelta\n |\n| Sign languages | * British\n* Irish\n* Northern Irish\n* *Old Kentish*\n |\n| Languages by region | * Cornwall\n* Northern Ireland\n* Scotland\n* Wales\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe table below outlines living indigenous **languages of the United Kingdom** (England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland).

Cornish, Scots in Scotland and Northern Ireland (in the latter territory officially known as Ulster Scots or Ullans, but in the speech of users simply as Scottish or Scots) are protected by the lower level only (Section II).

English has de facto official status everywhere, whereas Welsh has limited, but still considerable, official, de jure, status in only the public service, the judiciary, and elsewhere as prescribed in legislation. The Welsh language is protected by the Welsh Language Act 1993 and the Government of Wales Act 1998, and since 1998 it has been common, for example, for almost all British Government Departments to provide both printed documentation and official websites in both English and Welsh. On 7 December 2010, the National Assembly for Wales unanimously approved a set of measures to develop the use of the Welsh language within Wales.[37][38] On 9 February 2011, this measure received Royal Assent and was passed, thus making the Welsh language an officially recognised language within Wales.[39]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWhile in continental Europe closely related languages and dialects may get official recognition and support, in the UK there is a tendency to view closely related vernaculars as a single language. Even British Sign Language is mistakenly thought of as a form of 'English' by some, rather than as a language in its own right, with a distinct grammar and vocabulary. The boundaries are not always clear cut, which makes it hard to estimate numbers of speakers.\n\n\n\n#### Hostility[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n10. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Anorak, Scots. \"Ulster Scots in the Northern Ireland Census\". *Scots Language Centre*.

However, this wording has no clear meaning in law, and was chosen to prevent the assumption that the Gaelic language is in any way considered to have \"equal validity or parity of esteem with English\".[46] A major limitation of the act, though, is that it does not constitute any form of recognition for the Gaelic language by the UK government, and UK public bodies operating in Scotland, as reserved bodies, are explicitly exempted from its provisions.[47]\n\n\n\n#### Scots[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Scots language\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nScots within Scotland and the regional varieties of English within England receive little or no official recognition. The dialects of northern England share some features with Scots that those of southern England do not. The regional dialects of England were once extremely varied, as is recorded in Joseph Wright's *English Dialect Dictionary* and the Survey of English Dialects, but they have died out over time so that regional differences are now largely in pronunciation rather than in grammar or vocabulary.\n\n\nPublic funding of minority languages continues to produce mixed reactions, and there is sometimes resistance to their teaching in schools. Partly as a result, proficiency in languages other than \"Standard\" English can vary widely.\n\n\n\n## Immigrant languages[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMany Black Britons speak English as their first language. Their ancestors mostly came from the West Indies, particularly Jamaica, and generally also spoke English-based creole languages,[79] hence there are significant numbers of Caribbean creole speakers (see below for Ethnologue figures). A large proportion of the Black British population, especially African-born immigrants speak French as a first or second language.\n\n\nBritish Asians speak dozens of different languages, and it is difficult to determine how many people speak each language alongside English. The largest subgroup of British Asians are those of Punjabi origin (representing approximately two thirds of direct migrants from South Asia to the UK), from both India and Pakistan, they number over 2 million in the UK and are the largest Punjabi community outside of Indo subcontinent.[80] The Punjabi language, with  its dialects, is currently the third most spoken language in the United Kingdom.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n26. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"The GP Patient Survey in Northern Ireland 2009/10 Summary Report\" (PDF).

It is also the language spoken at home by the great majority of the U.S. population (approximately 78.5%).[6] Many other languages are also spoken at home, especially Spanish (13.3% of the population), according to the American Community Survey (ACS) of the U.S. Census Bureau; these include indigenous languages originally spoken by Native Americans, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and native populations in the U.S. unincorporated territories. Other languages were brought in by people from Europe, Africa, Asia, other parts of the Americas, and Oceania, including multiple dialects, creole languages, pidgin languages, and sign languages originating in what is now the United States.

[*citation needed*] Because of its legacy in Louisiana, that state is served by the Council for the Development of French in Louisiana (CODOFIL), the only state agency in the United States whose mission is to serve a linguistic population.
