Li stepped down as president in 1988 and was succeeded by Yang Shangkun. Li was then named Chairman of the National Committee of the CPPCC. He was a strong supporter of Jiang Zemin's rise to power,[*citation needed*] and during the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, Li was one of the hardline Party elders who pushed for a strong response to the demonstrations and supported Premier Li Peng's desire to use military force to suppress the protests.[5][11][12] Li continued to serve in government until his death in 1992.\n\n\n\n## Family[edit]\n\n\nLi had four children. His youngest daughter, Li Xiaolin, is the President of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries. She is a member of the CPPCC national committee.[13][14]\n\n\n\n## Death and later commemoration[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Li with his wife Lin Jiamei and Ronald Reagan (1985)\n![](image)Li as President, 1985\nIn 1983, after the passing of a new Constitution, Li was appointed President of China at the age of 74. Although according to the 1982 Constitution the role of President was \"largely ceremonial\", it recognized Li's status as a respected Party elder and a member of the CCP Politburo Standing Committee, and Li himself went on to forcefully use his still very substantial influence to support leftist policies. In 1984, Li met with U.S. President Ronald Reagan during the latter's visit to China, notably discussing the status of Taiwan with the President.[10] Li visited the United States in July 1985, the first time the head of state of the People's Republic of China made such a visit.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Rittenberg, Sidney; Bennett, Amanda (2001). *The Man Who Stayed Behind*.

Li played a key role in blocking privatizations and maintaining state control in many sectors of the economy, promoted classical Communist political and cultural values through his patronage of theorists such as Hu Qiaomu and Deng Liqun, and was instrumental in purging liberals Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang. He enthusiastically advocated for the military suppression of the Tiananmen Square protests.\n\n\n\n\n## Biography[edit]\n\n\n### Early career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Li in the People's Liberation Army during the Civil War (1946)\nBorn in Hong'an, Hubei, Li came from a poor family and spent his teenage years working at a carpenter's shop. He joined the Chinese Communist Party in December 1927, and served as an army captain and political commissar for the Chinese Red Army during the Long March. He was a military cadre in Zhang Guotao West Route Army.[6]: 476\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLi worked as an apprentice carpenter in his teenage years to support his family. He joined the Communist Party in December 1927 and became a soldier in the Chinese Red Army. After studying at the Military–Political University and the Central Party School, he became an influential and successful military commander during the Second Sino–Japanese War and the Chinese Civil War, distinguishing himself in the Huai–Hai Campaign.[4] After the PRC was established, he served as Governor and Party Secretary of his native Hubei Province from 1949 to 1954, and then joined the central leadership in Beijing, serving as Minister of Finance (1954–1970) and Vice Premier (1954–1982). He supported Mao Zedong's designated successor, Hua Guofeng, and was named Vice Chairman of the Party (1977–1982).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Political offices\n |\n| --- |\n| **New title** |  **Governor of Hubei** 1949–1954\n | Succeeded byLiu Zihou\n |\n| Preceded byDeng Xiaoping\n |  **Minister of Finance of the People's Republic of China** 1954–1970\n | Succeeded byZhang Jifu\n |\n| Preceded byZhang Chunqiao\n |  **First-ranking Vice Premier of the People's Republic of China** 1976–1977\n | Succeeded byDeng Xiaoping\n |\n| Preceded byYe Jianying\n***as Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress*** |  **President of the People's Republic of China** 1983–1988\n | Succeeded byYang Shangkun\n |\n| Preceded byDeng Yingchao\n |  **Chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference** 1988–1992\n | Succeeded byLi Ruihuan\n |\n| Party political offices\n |\n| **New title** |  **Secretary of the CCP Hubei Committee** 1949–1954\n | Succeeded byWang Renzhong\n |\n| Preceded byYe Jianying\n |  **Vice Chairman of the Chinese Communist PartyServed alongside: Deng Xiaoping, Chen Yun, Zhao Ziyang, Ye Jianying, Hua Guofeng** 1977–1982\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHowever, Deng quickly terminated these ideas and instituted his own \"go slow\" approach that involved gradually allowing the development of light industry and consumer goods.[8]: xviii[9] He also went about assigning government posts to younger men who were followers of his ideas. One of these was Premier Zhao Ziyang, whom Li strongly opposed for being too willing to import Western ideas and move away from a planned economy. According to Zhao, Li \"hated me because I was implementing Deng Xiaoping's reforms, but since it was difficult for him to openly oppose Deng, he made me the target of his opposition.\"[8]: xviii–xix\n\n\n\n### Presidency[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n12th Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party (1982–1987)\n |\n| --- |\n| Standing Committee | 1.

After the demise of the Gang, Li was appointed Vice Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party and a member of the Central Military Commission.\n\n\n\n### Post-Mao politician[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLi was described as an \"orthodox\" or \"Soviet-style\" communist and was a firm believer in central planning and sociopolitical conformity, so disliked Deng Xiaoping's more radical economic reform ideas. He had in fact been largely responsible for drafting the short-lived Ten Year Plan of 1978 which attempted to build a Soviet-style economy based around heavy industry and energy production. Li's ideas enjoyed strong support among some sections of the Chinese top leadership; General Yu Qiuli and his \"oil clique\", for example, fully supported Li.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nVice Premiers of the People's Republic of China (list)\n |\n| --- |\n| Provisional Cabinet | 1.

Li stepped down as president in 1988 and was succeeded by Yang Shangkun. Li was then named Chairman of the National Committee of the CPPCC. He was a strong supporter of Jiang Zemin's rise to power,[*citation needed*] and during the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, Li was one of the hardline Party elders who pushed for a strong response to the demonstrations and supported Premier Li Peng's desire to use military force to suppress the protests.[5][11][12] Li continued to serve in government until his death in 1992.\n\n\n\n## Family[edit]\n\n\nLi had four children.

Although according to the 1982 Constitution the role of President was \"largely ceremonial\", it recognized Li's status as a respected Party elder and a member of the CCP Politburo Standing Committee, and Li himself went on to forcefully use his still very substantial influence to support leftist policies. In 1984, Li met with U.S. President Ronald Reagan during the latter's visit to China, notably discussing the status of Taiwan with the President.[10] Li visited the United States in July 1985, the first time the head of state of the People's Republic of China made such a visit.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Rittenberg, Sidney; Bennett, Amanda (2001). *The Man Who Stayed Behind*.

The returning of Hong Kong from the United Kingdom in 1997 and of Macau from Portugal in 1999, and entry into the World Trade Organization in 2001, were landmark moments of his era.[3] China also witnessed improved relations with the outside world, while the Communist Party maintained its tight control over the state. Jiang faced criticism over human rights abuses, including the crackdown on the Falun Gong movement. His contributions to party doctrine, known as the \"Three Represents\", were written into the CCP constitution in 2002. Jiang gradually vacated his official leadership titles from 2002 to 2005, being succeeded in these roles by Hu Jintao, although he and his political faction continued to influence affairs until much later.

He would often use foreign languages in front of the camera; once, he gave a 40-minute speech entirely in Russian.[66] In an encounter with Hong Kong reporter Sharon Cheung in 2000 regarding the central government's apparent \"imperial order\" of supporting Tung Chee-hwa to seek a second term as Chief Executive of Hong Kong, Jiang scolded the Hong Kong journalists as \"too simple, sometimes naive\" in English.[67]\n\n\n\n### \"Three Represents\"[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Three Represents\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nState representative of the People's Republic of China\n |\n| --- |\n| * President\n* Vice President\n |\n| Common Program(1949–1954) | CPG Chairman\nMao Zedong\n | ![](image)\n |\n| 1954 Constitution(1954–1975) | Chairperson\nMao Zedong\nLiu Shaoqi\n*Song Qingling & Dong Biwu* (co-acting)\n*Dong Biwu* (acting)\n |\n| 1975 & 1978 Constitutions(1975–1982) | NPCSC Chairperson\nZhu De\n*Song Qingling* (acting)\nYe Jianying\n |\n| 1982 Constitution(1982–present) | President\nLi Xiannian\nYang Shangkun\nJiang Zemin\nHu Jintao\nXi Jinping\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nChairmen of the Central Military Commission\n |\n| --- |\n| Party CMC Chairmen | * Mao Zedong\n* Hua Guofeng\n* Deng Xiaoping\n* Jiang Zemin\n* Hu Jintao\n* Xi Jinping\n | ![Emblem of the People's Liberation Army](image)\n |\n| State CMC Chairmen | * Deng Xiaoping\n* Jiang Zemin\n* Hu Jintao\n* Xi Jinping\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n44. **^** \"Jiang Zemin to Have Lower Rank in Communist Party\". *The Telegraph*.

At the banquet he sat next to Xi Jinping, who had then succeeded Hu Jintao as CCP general secretary. In September 2015, Jiang attended the parade celebrating 70 years since end of World War II; there, Jiang again sat next to Xi Jinping and Hu Jintao.[98] He appeared on 29 May 2017 at Shanghai Technology University.[99]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2008, Jiang published an academic article on China's clean energy resources and another on China's information technology development.[89]: 100\n\n\n\n### Official appearances after retirement[edit]\n\n\nJiang continued to make official appearances after giving up his last title in 2004. In China's strictly defined protocol sequence, Jiang's name always appeared immediately after Hu Jintao's and in front of the remaining sitting members of the CCP Politburo Standing Committee. In 2007, Jiang was seen with Hu Jintao on stage at a ceremony celebrating the 80th anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army,[90] and toured the Military Museum of the Chinese People's Revolution with Li Peng, Zhu Rongji, and other former senior officials.[91] On 8 August 2008, Jiang appeared at the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics.[92] He also stood beside Hu Jintao during the mass parade celebrating the 60th anniversary of the People's Republic of China in October 2009.[93]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAt the first meeting of the new CCP Politburo Standing Committee, after the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989, Jiang criticized the previous period as \"hard on the economy, soft on politics\" and advocated increasing political thought work.[40] Anne-Marie Brady wrote that \"Jiang Zemin was a long time political cadre with a nose for ideological work and its importance. This meeting marked the beginning of a new era in propaganda and political thought work in China.\" Soon after, the Central Propaganda Department was given more resources and power, \"including the power to go in to the propaganda-related work units and cleanse the ranks of those who had been supportive of the democracy movement.\"[40]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_3zYoebtUap8ks15F1sB5jpvT","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

He lived in a yaodong in the village of Liangjiahe, Shaanxi province, where he joined the CCP after several failed attempts and worked as the local party secretary. After studying chemical engineering at Tsinghua University as a worker-peasant-soldier student, Xi rose through the ranks politically in China's coastal provinces. Xi was governor of Fujian from 1999 to 2002, before becoming governor and party secretary of neighboring Zhejiang from 2002 to 2007. Following the dismissal of the party secretary of Shanghai, Chen Liangyu, Xi was transferred to replace him for a brief period in 2007. He subsequently joined the Politburo Standing Committee (PSC) of the CCP the same year and served as first secretary of the Central Secretariat in October 2007. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nXi is the first CCP general secretary born after the establishment of the PRC. Since assuming power, Xi has introduced far-ranging measures to enforce party discipline and to impose internal unity. His anti-corruption campaign led to the downfall of prominent incumbent and retired CCP officials, including Zhou Yongkang, a former member of the PSC. He has also enacted or promoted a more aggressive foreign policy, particularly with regard to China's relations with the U.S., the nine-dash line in the South China Sea, the Sino-Indian border dispute, and the political status of Taiwan. He has sought to expand China's African and Eurasian influence through the Belt and Road Initiative. Xi has expanded support for state-owned enterprises (SOEs), advanced military-civil fusion, overseen targeted poverty alleviation programs, and has attempted to reform the property sector. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n9. **^** Li, Cheng. \"Xi Jinping's Inner Circle (Part 2: Friends from Xi's Formative Years)\" (PDF). *Hoover Institution*. pp. 6–22.

Xi's political ideas and principles, known as Xi Jinping Thought, have been incorporated into the party and national constitutions, and he has emphasized the importance of national security and the need for CCP leadership over the country. As the central figure of the fifth generation of leadership of the PRC, Xi has centralized institutional power by taking on multiple positions, including chairing the National Security Commission and new steering committees on economic and social reforms, military restructuring and modernization, and the Internet. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n492. **^** Buckley, Chris (8 February 2012). \"China leader-in-waiting carries heavy political baggage to U.S.\" *Reuters*.
