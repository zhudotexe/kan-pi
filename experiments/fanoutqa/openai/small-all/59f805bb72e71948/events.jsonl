Several of these have been closed for brief periods: for example the University of Siena was closed 1805–1815 during the Napoleonic wars, and universities in the Czech Republic and Poland were closed during Nazi occupation, 1938–1945.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nInclusion in this list is determined by the date at which the educational institute first met the traditional definition of a university used by academic historians[Note 1][*specify*] although it may have existed as a different kind of institution before that time.[4] This definition limits the term *university* to institutions with distinctive structural and legal features that developed in Europe, and which make the university form different from other institutions of higher learning in the pre-modern world, even though these may sometimes now be referred to popularly as universities. To be included in the list below, the university must have been founded before 1500 in Europe or be the oldest university derived from the medieval European model in a country or region. It must also be still in operation, with institutional continuity retained throughout its history. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe majority of European countries had universities by 1500. Many universities were established at institutes of learning such as schools and colleges that may have been founded significantly earlier but were not classed as universities upon their foundation; this is normally described in the notes for that institution. In some countries (particularly the US and those influenced by its culture), degree-granting higher education institutions that would normally be called universities are instead called colleges. In this case, both the oldest institution that would normally be regarded as a university and the oldest institution (if different) to actually be called a university are given. In many parts of the world, the first university to have a presence was an institution based elsewhere (often the University of London via the affiliation of a local college); where this is different from the first locally established university, both are given.\n\n\n\n### Africa[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 1499[5] | Complutense University of Madrid | ![Pennant of the Crown of Castile](image) Crown of Castile | ![Spain](image) Madrid, Spain\n | A *studium generale* was founded by Sancho IV of Castile in 1293 in Alcalá de Henares. Very little is known of this institution over the next two centuries.[66] In 1499 a papal bull was granted by Pope Alexander VI authorising Archbishop Cisneros to establish a *Colegio Mayor* in Alcalá with the same powers as the universities of Salamanca and Vallodolid, from which date Verger considers it a university.[5] The new university opened in 1509.[67] The university was moved to Madrid in 1836 by royal decree.[68] |\n| 1500[5] | University of Valencia | ![Standard of the Crown of Aragon](image) Crown of Aragon | ![Spain](image) Valencia, Spain\n |  |\n\n\n## Oldest universities by country or region after 1500 still in operation[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 1365[5] | University of Vienna | ![](image) Holy Roman Empire | ![Austria](image) Vienna, Austria\n | Founded by Rudolf IV, Duke of Austria, granted papal assent in 1384 by Pope Urban VI.

Pope Urban VI granted permission for the founding of a university in October 1385 to Rupert I, Elector Palatine; teaching began in June 1386.

From 1401 the city had a medical school founded by King Martin of Aragon (the *Estudi General de Medecina de Barcelona*), to which a faculty of arts was added in 1402. Before this, there were chairs of higher education (associated with the cathedral, the Dominican Convent of Santa Carolina, and the *escoles majors* supported by the city's governing council) from the 13th century.[60] |\n| 1451[5] | University of Glasgow | ![](image) Kingdom of Scotland | ![United Kingdom](image) Glasgow, United Kingdom\n | Founded by papal bull in 1451, it is the fourth-oldest university in the English-speaking world and one of Scotland's four ancient universities.

It was founded in 1218 by King Alfonso IX. It is the oldest university in the Hispanic world and one of the oldest in the world in continuous operation. It has over 30,000 students from 50 different nationalities.[9]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources in this section. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed.*Find sources:* \"University of Salamanca\" – news **·** newspapers **·** books **·** scholar **·** JSTOR *(August 2021)* *(Learn how and when to remove this message)*\n |\n\n\nPrior to the foundation of the university, Salamanca was home to a cathedral school, known to have been in existence by 1130. The university was founded as a *studium generale* by the Leonese king Alfonso IX in 1218 as the *scholas Salamanticae*, with the actual creation of the university (or the transformation of the existing school into the university) occurring between August 1218 and the following winter.[1] A further royal charter from King Alfonso X, dated 8 May 1254, established rules for the organisation and financial endowment of the university, and referred to it for the first time by that name.[10] A papal bull of Alexander IV in 1255 confirmed the Royal Charter of Alfonso X and granted universal recognition to the university's degrees.[11]\n\n\nThe historical phrases *Quod natura non dat, Salmantica non praestat* (what nature does not give, Salamanca does not lend, in Latin) and *Multos et doctissimos Salmantica habet* (many and very versed Salamanca has) give an idea of the prestige the institution rapidly acquired.[12][*failed verification*]\n\n\nIn the reign of King Ferdinand II of Aragon and Queen Isabella I of Castile, the Spanish government was revamped. Contemporary with the Spanish Inquisition, the expulsion of the Jews and Muslims, and the conquest of Granada, there was a certain professionalization of the apparatus of the state. This involved the massive employment of \"letrados\", i.e., bureaucrats and lawyers, who were \"licenciados\" (university graduates), particularly, of Salamanca, and the newly founded University of Alcalá. These men staffed the various councils of state, including, eventually, the Consejo de Indias and Casa de Contratacion, the two highest bodies in metropolitan Spain for the government of the Spanish Empire in the New World.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nWhile Columbus was lobbying the King and Queen for a contract to seek out a western route to the Indies, he made his case to a council of geographers at the University of Salamanca. While the geographers were skeptical of Columbus and his voyage calculations, the University of Salamanca always defended the theory of unknown territories to the west, and supported Columbus' voyage, believing that new territories may be discovered. In the next century, the morality and laws of colonization in the Indies were debated by the School of Salamanca, along with the development of the study of science, geography and cartography of the Americas, and as well as the study of general subjects of economics, philosophy and theology.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nLike Oxford and Cambridge, Salamanca had a number of colleges (*Colegios Mayores*). These were founded as charitable institutions to enable poor scholars to attend the university. By the eighteenth century they had become closed corporations controlled by the families of their founders, and dominated the university between them. Most were destroyed by Napoleon's troops. In the 19th century, the Spanish government dissolved the university's faculties of canon law and theology. They were later reestablished in the 1940s as part of the Pontifical University of Salamanca.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Related affairs[edit]\n\n\nThe faculty renovated the theology department, laid the foundation for modern-day law, international law, modern economic science and actively participated in the Council of Trent. The school's mathematicians studied the calendar reform, commissioned by Pope Gregory XIII and proposed the solution that was later implemented. By 1580, 6,500 new students had arrived at Salamanca each year, amongst the graduates were state officials of the Spanish monarchy administration. It was also during this period when the first female university students were probably admitted, Beatriz Galindo and Luisa de Medrano, the latter probably being the first woman ever to give classes at a university.[13]\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n### Sorcery[edit]\n\n\nIn popular belief, the university was associated with sorcery. A certain cave in Salamanca was considered the site of a school of black magic. In Spanish, Salamanca may mean \"cave\", \"an evil iguana\" and \"hand trick\"[14] and the *salamanquesa* (*Tarentola mauritanica*, the Spanish name is also derived from \"salamander\") is a reptile with magical attributes in Spanish tradition.[15]\nIn Romanian folklore, the devil runs a school of black magic named *Scholomance*.\n\n\nThe name is derived from \"Salamanca\" and the wise king \"Solomon\".[16][17]\n\n\n\n## Present day[edit]\n\n\nSalamanca draws undergraduate and graduate students from across Spain and the world; it is the top-ranked university in Spain based on the number of students coming from other regions.[18] It is also known for its Spanish courses for non-native speakers, which attract more than two thousand foreign students each year.[19]\n\n\nToday, the University of Salamanca is an important center for the study of humanities and is particularly noted for its language studies, as well as in laws and economics. Scientific research is carried out in the university and research centers associated with it, such as at the Centro de Investigación del Cáncer [Cancer Research Centre],[20] Instituto de Neurociencias de Castilla y León or INCyL [Institute of Neuroscience of Castile and León],[21] Centro de Láseres Pulsados Ultracortos Ultraintensos [Ultrashort Ultraintense Pulse Lasers Centre]. It is one of only two Hispanophone universities in the world that have a MoU with the United Nations to train language professionals for the organization.[22] In conjunction with the University of Cambridge, the University of Salamanca co-founded the Association of Language Testers in Europe (ALTE) in 1989.\n\n\nIn 2018, the institution celebrated its eighth centennial.[23]\n\n\n\n## Library[edit]\n\n\nThe library holds about 906,000 volumes.[24]\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\n### Notable staff[edit]\n\n\n* Juan de Galavís, professor of theology; later became Archbishop of Santo Domingo and Archbishop of Bogotá\n* Francisco Elías de Tejada y Spínola, professor of Philosophy of Law and Natural Law\n* Enrique Gil Robles, professor of Natural Law\n* Paul Nuñez Coronel (d.1534), professor of Hebrew\n* Miguel de Unamuno, writer\n* Beatriz Galindo, (d. 1534), professor of Latin and rhetoric\n* Luisa de Medrano (d. 1527) professor of Latin.

The university was granted a charter (*Authentica habita*) by Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa in 1158, but in the 19th century, a committee of historians led by Giosuè Carducci traced the founding of the university back to 1088, which would make it the oldest continuously operating university in the world.[11][12][13] However, the development of the institution at Bologna into a university was a gradual process. Paul Grendler writes that \"it is not likely that enough instruction and organization existed to merit the term *university* before the 1150s, and it might not have happened before the 1180s.\"[14]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nUniversities in Italy\n |\n| --- |\n| Major Public | * Bari\n* Bologna\n* Catania\n* Florence\n* Milan\n* Milan Polytechnic\n* Naples Federico II\n* Padua\n* Palermo\n* Pisa\n* Rome La Sapienza\n* Turin\n* Turin Polytechnic\n |\n| Large Public | * Cagliari\n* Arcavacata\n* Chieti–Pescara D'Annunzio\n* Caserta Luigi Vanvitelli\n* Genoa\n* L'Aquila\n* Messina\n* Milan Bicocca\n* Parma\n* Pavia\n* Perugia\n* Rome III\n* Rome Tor Vergata\n* Salento\n* Salerno\n* Verona\n |\n| Medium Public | * Bari Polytechnic\n* Bergamo\n* Brescia\n* Ferrara\n* Marche Polytechnic\n* Modena and Reggio Emilia\n* Naples Eastern\n* Naples Parthenope\n* Sassari\n* Siena\n* Trento\n* Trieste\n* Udine\n* Urbino\n* Venice Ca' Foscari\n |\n| Small Public | * Aosta\n* Potenza\n* Bozen-Bolzano\n* Camerino\n* Cassino\n* Catanzaro\n* Enna\n* Florence SUM\n* Foggia\n* Varese\n* Lucca IMT\n* ISIA\n* Macerata\n* Campobasso\n* Pavia IUSS\n* Perugia Foreigners\n* Pisa Normale\n* Pisa Sant'Anna\n* Reggio Calabria\n* Rome Foro Italico\n* Sannio\n* Siena Foreigners\n* Teramo\n* Trieste SISSA\n* Viterbo\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe university saw the first woman to earn a university degree and teach at a university, Bettisia Gozzadini, and the first woman to earn both a doctorate in science and a salaried position as a university professor, Laura Bassi. The University of Bologna has had a central role in the sciences during the medieval age and the Italian renaissance, where it housed and educated Nicholas Copernicus as well as numerous other renaissance mathematicians.[6] It has educated a wide range of notable alumni, amongst them a large number of Italian scientists, prime ministers, supreme court judges, and priests.[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe university arose around mutual aid societies (known as *universitates scholarium*) of foreign students called \"nations\" (as they were grouped by nationality) for protection against city laws which imposed collective punishment on foreigners for the crimes and debts of their countrymen. These students then hired scholars from the city's pre-existing lay and ecclesiastical schools to teach them subjects such as liberal arts, notarial law, theology, and *ars dictaminis* (scrivenery).[15] The lectures were given in informal schools called *scholae*. In time the various *universitates scholarium* decided to form a larger association, or *Studium*—thus, the university. The *Studium* grew to have a strong position of collective bargaining with the city, since by then it derived significant revenue through visiting foreign students, who would depart if they were not well treated. The foreign students in Bologna received greater rights, and collective punishment was ended. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** *Charters of foundation and early documents of the universities of the Coimbra Group*, Hermans, Jos.

On 25 April 1951 the first issue of the review was published in Bologna.[36] In a short time, \"il Mulino\" became one of the most interesting reference points in Italy for the political and cultural debate and established important editorial relationships in Italy and abroad. Editorial activities evolved along with the review. In 1954, the il Mulino publishing house (It. *Società editrice il Mulino*) was founded, which today represents one of the most relevant Italian publishers. In addition to this were initiated research projects (focusing mostly on the educational institutions and the political system in Italy), that eventually led, in 1964, to the establishment of the Istituto Carlo Cattaneo.\n\n\n\n### Collegio Superiore[edit]\n\n\nThe *Collegio Superiore* is an excellence institution inside the University of Bologna, aimed at promoting students' merit through dedicated learning programmes.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Europe\n |\n| --- |\n| Albania | * Tirana\n |\n| Cyprus | * CUT\n* University of Cyprus\n |\n| Finland | * Tampere\n |\n| France | * Montpellier 2\n* Paris 8\n* Paul Cézanne\n |\n| Greece | * Athens\n* Panteion\n |\n| Italy | * Bari\n* Bologna\n* Camerino\n* Caserta\n* Catania\n* Chieti–Pescara D'Annunzio\n* Messina\n* Modena and Reggio Emilia\n* Campobasso\n* Naples Federico II\n* Padua\n* Palermo\n* Perugia\n* Perugia Foreigners\n* Reggio Calabria\n* Rome III\n* Rome la Sapienza\n* Rome S.

There is evidence of teaching as early as 1096,[2] making it the oldest university in the English-speaking world and the world's second-oldest university in continuous operation.[2][11][12] It grew rapidly from 1167, when Henry II banned English students from attending the University of Paris.[2] After disputes between students and Oxford townsfolk in 1209, some academics fled north-east to Cambridge where they established what became the University of Cambridge.[13] The two English ancient universities share many common features and are jointly referred to as *Oxbridge*.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe university has come under criticism for the number of students it accepts from private schools;[132] for instance, Laura Spence's rejection from the university in 2000 led to widespread debate.[133] In 2016, the University of Oxford gave 59% of offers to UK students to students from state schools, while about 93% of all UK pupils and 86% of post-16 UK pupils are educated in state schools.[134][135][136] However, 64% of UK applicants were from state schools and the university notes that state school students apply disproportionately to oversubscribed subjects.[137] The proportion of students coming from state schools has been increasing. From 2015 to 2019, the state proportion of total UK students admitted each year was: 55.6%, 58.0%, 58.2%, 60.5% and 62.3%.[138] Oxford University spends over £6 million per year on outreach programs to encourage applicants from underrepresented demographics.[134]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Map of the University of Oxford\n |\n| --- |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nUniversity of Oxford| ![](image)Coat of arms\n |\n| Latin: *Universitas Oxoniensis* |\n| Other name\n | The Chancellor, Masters and Scholars of the University of Oxford[1] |\n| Motto | Latin: *Dominus illuminatio mea* |\n| Motto in English\n | The Lord is my light |\n| Type | Research university |\n| Established | c. 1096; 928 years ago (1096)[2] |\n| Academic affiliations\n | * IARU\n* Russell Group\n* Europaeum\n* EUA\n* LERU\n* SES\n* Universities UK\n |\n| Endowment | £8.12 billion (including colleges) (2022)[5] |\n| Budget | £2.775 billion (2021–22)[4] |\n| Chancellor | The Lord Patten of Barnes |\n| Vice-Chancellor | Irene Tracey[6] |\n| Academic staff\n | 6,945 (2022)[7] |\n| Students | 26,497 (2022)[8][9] |\n| Undergraduates | 12,580 |\n| Postgraduates | 13,445 |\n| Other students\n | 430 |\n| Location | Oxford\n, England\n51°45′18″N 01°15′18″W﻿ / ﻿51.75500°N 1.25500°W﻿ / 51.75500; -1.25500 |\n| Campus | University town |\n| Colours |   Oxford Blue[10] |\n| Sporting affiliations\n | Blue (university sport) |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Percentage of state-school students at Oxford and Cambridge[122][123]\nIn common with most British universities, prospective undergraduate students apply through the UCAS application system, but prospective applicants for the University of Oxford, along with those for medicine, dentistry, and University of Cambridge applicants, must observe an earlier deadline of 15 October.[124] The Sutton Trust maintains that Oxford University and Cambridge University recruit undergraduates disproportionately from 8 schools which accounted for 1,310 Oxbridge places during three years, contrasted with 1,220 from 2,900 other schools.[125]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2018 the university's annual admissions report revealed that eight of Oxford's colleges had accepted fewer than three black applicants in the past three years.[139] Labour MP David Lammy said, \"This is social apartheid and it is utterly unrepresentative of life in modern Britain.\"[140] In 2020, Oxford had increased its proportion of Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) students to record levels.[141][142] The number of BAME undergraduates accepted to the university in 2020 rose to 684 students, or 23.6% of the UK intake, up from 558 or 22% in 2019; the number of Black students was 106 (3.7% of the intake), up from 80 students (3.2%).[142][143] UCAS data also showed that Oxford is more likely than comparable institutions to make offers to ethnic minority and socially disadvantaged pupils.[141]\n\n\n\n### Teaching and degrees[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Degrees of the University of Oxford, List of professorships at the University of Oxford, and Undergraduate education at University of Oxford\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n8. **^** \"University of Oxford – Student Statistics\". *Tableau Software*.

All students are members of a college.[15] It does not have a main campus, and its buildings and facilities are scattered throughout the city centre.

The clause can be invoked in the event of circumstances outside the reasonable control of the university. The clause was introduced following a record number of A-level pupils obtained the highest grades from teacher assessment, which was introduced due to the cancellation of A-level examinations during the COVID-19 pandemic.[110][111]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n138. **^** \"Half of universities have fewer than 5% poor white students\". *BBC News*. 14 February 2019.

The colleges are charged with giving or arranging most supervisions, student accommodation, and funding most extracurricular activities. During the 1990s, the University of Cambridge added a substantial number of new specialist research laboratories on several sites around the city, and major expansion continues.[147] From 2000 to 2006, the University of Cambridge maintained a research partnership with MIT in the United States, known as the Cambridge–MIT Institute, which was discontinued after evolving into what is now called the CMI Partnership Programme.\n\n\n\n### Graduation tradition and ceremony[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA school in the University of Cambridge is a broad administrative grouping of related faculties and other units. Each has an elected supervisory body known as a Council, composed of representatives of the various constituent bodies. The University of Cambridge maintains six such schools:[77]\n\n\n\n* Arts and Humanities\n* Biological Sciences\n* Clinical Medicine\n* Humanities and Social Sciences\n* Physical Sciences\n* Technology\n\nTeaching and research at the university is organised by faculties. The faculties have varying organisational substructures that partly reflect their respective histories and the university's operational needs, which may include a number of departments and other institutions. A small number of bodies called syndicates hold responsibility for teaching and research, including for the University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate, the University Press, and the University Library.\n\n\n\n### Central administration[edit]\n\n\n#### Chancellor and Vice-Chancellor[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe University of Cambridge has been criticised for admitting a lower percentage of Black students, though many apply.

The economic growth associated with the university's high tech and biotech growth has been labeled the Cambridge Phenomenon, and has included the addition of 1,500 new companies and as many as 40,000 new jobs added between 1960 and 2010, mostly at Silicon Fen, a business cluster launched by the university in the late 20th century.[48]\n\n\n\n### Myths, legends and traditions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: University of Cambridge legends\n\nSee also: Category:Terminology of the University of Cambridge\n\nFurther information: Nine Lessons and Carols and wooden spoon (award)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFor the first several centuries of its existence, as was the case broadly in England and the world, the University of Cambridge was only open to male students.

Prior to ultimately being permitted admission to the university in 1948, female students were granted the right to take University of Cambridge exams beginning in the late 19th century.[36] Women were also allowed to study courses, take examinations, and have prior exam results recorded retroactively, dating back to 1881; for a brief period after the turn of the 20th century, this allowed the steamboat ladies to receive *ad eundem* degrees from the University of Dublin.[37]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe University of Cambridge and its constituent colleges include many notable locations, some of which are iconic or of historical, academic, religious, and cultural significance, including:\n\n\n\n* Bridge of Sighs, Cambridge\n* Cambridge University Botanic Garden\n* Church of St Mary the Great, Cambridge\n* Downing Site\n* Fenner's\n* Goldie Boathouse\n* King's College Chapel, Cambridge\n* Lady Mitchell Hall\n* Mathematical Bridge\n* Nevile's Court, Trinity College, Cambridge\n* Sidgwick Site\n* St Bene't's Church\n* The Backs\n* Trinity College Chapel, Cambridge\n* West Cambridge\n\n## Organisation and administration[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of institutions of the University of Cambridge\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n97. **^** \"Golden opportunities\".

Most colleges bring together academics and students from a broad range of disciplines. Each faculty, school, or department at the university includes academics affiliated with differing colleges.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe relationship between the university and the city of Cambridge has sometimes been uneasy. The phrase town and gown continues to be employed to distinguish between Cambridge residents (town) and University of Cambridge students (gown), who historically wore academical dress. Ferocious rivalry between Cambridge's residents and university students have periodically erupted over the centuries. During the Peasants' Revolt of 1381, strong clashes led to attacks and looting of university properties as locals contested the privileges granted by the British government to the University of Cambridge's academic staff. Residents burned university property in Market Square to the famed rallying cry \"Away with the learning of clerks, away with it!\".[45] Following these events, the University of Cambridge's Chancellor was given special powers allowing him to prosecute criminals and reestablish order in the city. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nEnough scholars ultimately took residence in Cambridge to form, along with the many scholars already there, the nucleus for the new university's formation.[16][17][18]\n\n\nBy 1225, a chancellor of the university was appointed, and writs issued by King Henry III in 1231 established that rents in Cambridge were to be set *secundum consuetudinem universitatis*, according to the custom of the university, and established a panel of two masters and two townsmen to determine these. A letter from Pope Gregory IX two years later to the chancellor and the guild of scholars granted the new university *ius non trahi extra*, or the right not to be drawn out, for three years, meaning its members could not be summoned to a court outside of the diocese of Ely.[19]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCosts to students for room and board vary considerably from college to college.[70][71] Similarly, the investment in student education by each college at the university varies widely between the colleges.[72]\n\n\nThree theological colleges at the university, Westcott House, Westminster College, and Ridley Hall Theological College, are members of the Cambridge Theological Federation and associated in partnership with university.[73]\n\n\nThe University of Cambridge's 31 colleges are:[74]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe university contributed significantly to the Allies' forces in World War I with 13,878 members of the university serving and 2,470 being killed in action during the war. Teaching, and the fees it earned, nearly came to a halt during World War I, and severe financial difficulties followed. As a result, the university received its first systematic state support in 1919, and a Royal commission was appointed in 1920 to recommend that the university (but not its colleges) begin receiving an annual grant.[33] Following World War II, the university experienced a rapid expansion in applications and enrollment, partly due to the success and popularity gained by many Cambridge scientists.[34] This was not without controversies, however. For example, Cambridge researchers were accused in 2023 of helping to develop weapon systems for Iran.[35]\n\n\n\n#### Parliamentary representation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cambridge University (UK Parliament constituency)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Percent of state school students at Cambridge and Oxford[125][126]\nPublic debate in the United Kingdom exists over whether admissions processes used at the University of Oxford and Cambridge are entirely merit-based and fair, whether enough students from state schools are encouraged to apply, and whether these students are offered sufficient admission. In 2020–21, 71% of all successful applicants were from state schools[127] compared to approximately 93% of all students in the UK who attended state schools and 82% of post-16 students[128]). \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe university's School of Clinical Medicine is based in Addenbrooke's Hospital, where medical students undergo their three-year clinical placement period after obtaining their BA degree.[60] The West Cambridge site is undergoing a major expansion and will host new buildings and fields for university sports.[61] Since 1990, Cambridge Judge Business School, on Trumpington Street, provides management education courses and is consistently ranked among the top 20 business schools in the world by *Financial Times*.[62]\n\n\nGiven that the sites are in relative proximity and the area around Cambridge is reasonably flat, one of the favourite modes of transport for students is the bicycle; an estimated one-fifth of journeys in the city are made by bike, a figure enhanced by the fact that students are not permitted to hold car park permits except under special circumstances.[63]\n\n\n\n### Notable locations[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Senate House\n* Cambridge University Council\n* Fictional Cambridge colleges\n* *Cambridge University Reporter*\n |\n| * ![](image) Category\n |\n\n| Links to related articles\n |\n| --- |\n| | * v\n* t\n* e\nUniversities in the United Kingdom\n |\n| --- |\n| England | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| East of England | * Anglia Ruskin\n* Bedfordshire\n* Cambridge\n* Cranfield\n* East Anglia\n* Essex\n* Hertfordshire\n* Norwich University of the Arts\n* Suffolk\n |\n| London | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter Cambridge was described as a *studium generale* in a letter from Pope Nicholas IV in 1290,[20] and confirmed as such by Pope John XXII's 1318 papal bull,[21] it became common for researchers from other European medieval universities to visit Cambridge to study or give lecture courses.[20]\n\n\n\n### Foundation of the colleges[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Colleges of the University of Cambridge and Oxford and Cambridge Act 1571\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGiven the competitive nature of gaining admission to the University of Cambridge, a number of educational consultancies have emerged to offer support with the application process.
