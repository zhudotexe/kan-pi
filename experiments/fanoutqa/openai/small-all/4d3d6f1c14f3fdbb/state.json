In 2009, he was appointed to Professor at the Einstein Institute of Mathematics at the Hebrew University.\n\n\n\n\n## Biography[edit]\n\n\nLindenstrauss was born into an Israeli-Jewish family with German Jewish origins, the son of the mathematician Joram Lindenstrauss, the namesake of the Johnson\u2013Lindenstrauss lemma, and computer scientist Naomi Lindenstrauss, both professors at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. His sister Ayelet Lindenstrauss is also a mathematician. He attended the Hebrew University Secondary School. In 1988 he was awarded a bronze medal at the International Mathematical Olympiad. He enlisted to the IDF's Talpiot program, and studied at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, where he earned his BSc in Mathematics and Physics in 1991 and his master's degree in mathematics in 1995. In 1999 he finished his Ph.D., his thesis being \"Entropy properties of dynamical systems\", under the guidance of Prof. Benjamin Weiss. He was a member at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, then a Szego Assistant Prof. at Stanford University. From 2003 to 2005, he was a Long Term Prize Fellow at the Clay Mathematics Institute.\n\n\n\n## Academic career[edit]\n\n\nIn Fall 2014, he was Visiting Miller Professor at the University of California, Berkeley.[3] Lindenstrauss is an editor for Duke Mathematical Journal and Journal d'Analyse Math\u00e9matique.[4][5]\n\n\nLindenstrauss works in the area of dynamics, particularly in the area of ergodic theory and its applications in number theory. With Anatole Katok and Manfred Einsiedler, he made progress on the Littlewood conjecture.[6]\n\n\nIn a series of two papers (one co-authored with Jean Bourgain) he made major progress on Peter Sarnak's Arithmetic Quantum Unique Ergodicity conjecture. The proof of the conjecture was completed by Kannan Soundararajan.\n\n\nRecently with Manfred Einsiedler, Philippe Michel and Akshay Venkatesh, he studied distributions of torus periodic orbits in some arithmetic spaces, generalizing theorems by Hermann Minkowski and Yuri Linnik.\n\n\nTogether with Benjamin Weiss he developed and studied systematically the invariant of mean dimension[7] introduced in 1999 by Mikhail Gromov.[8] In related work he introduced and studied the small boundary property and stated fundamental conjectures.[9]\n\n\nAmong his co-authors are Jean Bourgain, Manfred Einsiedler, Philippe Michel, Shahar Mozes, Akshay Venkatesh and Barak Weiss.\n\n\n\n## Awards and recognition[edit]\n\n\n* In 1988, Lindenstrauss represented Israel in the International Mathematical Olympiad and won a bronze medal.\n* During his service in the IDF, he was awarded the Israel Defense Prize.\n* In 2003, he was awarded the Salem Prize jointly with Kannan Soundararajan.\n* In 2004, he was awarded the European Mathematical Society Prize.\n* In 2008, he received the Michael Bruno Memorial Award.\n* In 2009, he was awarded the Erd\u0151s Prize.\n* In 2009, he received the Fermat Prize.\n* In 2010, he became the first Israeli to be awarded the Fields Medal, *for his results on measure rigidity in ergodic theory, and their applications to number theory*.[10]\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Israeli wins world's most prestigious math prize\". *ynet*. 19 August 2010.

He is the first Vietnamese national to have received the Fields Medal.[4][5][6][7][8]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nNg\u00f4 B\u1ea3o Ch\u00e2u was born in 1972, the son of an intellectual family in Hanoi, North Vietnam. His father, professor Ng\u00f4 Huy C\u1ea9n, is full professor of physics at the Vietnam National Institute of Mechanics. His mother, Tr\u1ea7n L\u01b0u V\u00e2n Hi\u1ec1n, is a physician and associate professor at an herbal medicine hospital in Hanoi.\n\n\nThe beginning of Ch\u00e2u's schooling was at an experimental elementary school that had been founded by the revolutionary pedagogue H\u1ed3 Ng\u1ecdc \u0110\u1ea1i, but when his father returned from the Soviet Union with his doctoral degree, he decided that Ch\u00e2u would learn more in traditional schools and enrolled him in the \"chuy\u00ean to\u00e1n\" (special classes for gifted students in mathematics) at the Tr\u01b0ng V\u01b0\u01a1ng Middle School.[9]\nAt age 15, Ch\u00e2u entered the special mathematics class at the High School for Gifted Students, Hanoi University of Science (Kh\u1ed1i chuy\u00ean T\u1ed5ng H\u1ee3p\u00a0\u2013 \u0110\u1ea1i h\u1ecdc Khoa H\u1ecdc T\u1ef1 Nhi\u00ean H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i[10]), formerly known as the A0-class. In grades 11 and 12, Ch\u00e2u participated in the 29th and 30th International Mathematical Olympiads (IMO) and became the first Vietnamese student to win two IMO gold medals,[11] of which the first one was won with a perfect score (42/42).[12]\n\n\nAfter high school, Ch\u00e2u expected to study in Budapest, but in the aftermath of the fall of Communism in Eastern Europe, the new Hungarian government halted scholarships to students from Vietnam.[13] After visiting Ch\u00e2u's father, Paul Germain, secretary of the French Academy of Sciences, arranged for Ch\u00e2u to study in France. He was offered a scholarship by the French government for undergraduate study at the Paris VI University, then in 1992, he entered the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure. He obtained a PhD in 1997 from the Universite Paris-Sud under the supervision of G\u00e9rard Laumon. He became a member of CNRS at Paris 13 University from 1998 to 2005, and defended his habilitation degree there in 2003. He holds both Vietnamese and French citizenship.[14]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nCh\u00e2u became a professor at Paris-Sud 11 University in 2005. In 2005, at age 33, Chau received the title of professor in Vietnam, becoming the country's youngest-ever professor.[12] Since 2007, Ch\u00e2u has worked at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, New Jersey, as well as the Hanoi Institute of Mathematics.[15] He joined the mathematics faculty at the University of Chicago on September 1, 2010. In addition, since 2011 he has been Scientific Director of the newly founded Vietnam Institute for Advanced Study in Mathematics (VIASM).[16] In 2016 Ch\u00e2u was Co-General Chair of Asiacrypt the first time that the Asian cryptography conference was held in Vietnam.[17]\n\n\n\n## Work[edit]\n\n\nCh\u00e2u first came to prominence by proving, in joint work with G\u00e9rard Laumon, the fundamental lemma for unitary groups. Their general strategy was to understand the local orbital integrals appearing in the fundamental lemma in terms of affine Springer fibers arising in the Hitchin fibration. This allowed them to employ the tools of geometric representation theory, namely the theory of perverse sheaves, to study what was initially a combinatorial problem of a number-theoretic nature. Chau eventually succeeded in formulating the proof for the fundamental lemma for Lie algebras in 2008.[12] Together with earlier results from Jean-Loup Waldspurger, who had shown that the full fundamental lemma results from this then missing result, this completed the proof of the fundamental lemma in all cases. As a result, Ch\u00e2u was awarded a Fields Medal in 2010.\n\n\nNg\u00f4 B\u1ea3o Ch\u00e2u was the co-author of the Vietnamese children's book *Ai and Ky in the land of the invisible numbers*.\n\n\n\n## Awards[edit]\n\n\nIn 2004, Ch\u00e2u and Laumon were awarded the Clay Research Award for their achievement in solving the fundamental lemma for the case of unitary groups.[12] Ch\u00e2u's proof of the general case was selected by *Time* as one of the Top Ten Scientific Discoveries of 2009.[15] In 2010, he received the Fields Medal. By decree on 22 April 2011, he was awarded a Knight of France's Legion of Honour.[18] In 2012, he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.[19] In 2021, he became an honorary member of the London Mathematical Society.[20][21]\n\n\n\n## Major publications[edit]\n\n\n* Ng\u00f4, Bao Ch\u00e2u. *Le lemme fondamental pour les alg\u00e8bres de Lie.

He was awarded the Fields Medal in 2010. His research involves complex analysis, dynamical systems and probability theory.[1][2]\n\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nSmirnov's Ph.D. was conducted at Caltech under advisor Nikolai Makarov. In 1998 he was employed as part of the faculty at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, after which he took up his second position as a professor in the Analysis, Mathematical Physics and Probability group at the University of Geneva in 2003.[3][4] In 2010, Smirnov became the founding director of the Chebyshev Laboratory in Saint Petersburg State University in Russia.\n\n\n\n## Research[edit]\n\n\nSmirnov has worked on percolation theory, where he proved Cardy's formula for critical site percolation on the triangular lattice, and deduced conformal invariance.[5] The conjecture was proved in the special case of site percolation on the triangular lattice.[6] Smirnov's theorem has led to a fairly complete theory for percolation on the triangular lattice, and to its relationship to the Schramm\u2013Loewner evolution introduced by Oded Schramm. He also established conformality for the two-dimensional critical Ising model.[7]\n\n\n\n## Awards[edit]\n\n\nSmirnov was awarded the Saint Petersburg Mathematical Society Prize (1997), the Clay Research Award (2001), the Salem Prize (joint with Oded Schramm, 2001), the G\u00f6ran Gustafsson Prize (2001), the Rollo Davidson Prize (2002), and the Prize of the European Mathematical Society (2004).[3] In 2010 Smirnov was awarded the Fields medal for his work on the mathematical foundations of statistical physics, particularly finite lattice models.[8] His citation reads \"for the proof of conformal invariance of percolation and the planar Ising model in statistical physics\".[9]\n\n\n\n## Publications[edit]\n\n\n* *Probability and Statistical Physics in St. Petersburg*, American Math Society, (2015)\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Stanislav Smirnov's publications on Google Scholar\".\n2. **^** \"Stanislav Smirnov's home page\".\n3. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"La M\u00e9daille Fields pour un professeur de l'UNIGE\". *University of Geneva press releases* (in French).
