The campus was designed along Beaux-Arts planning principles by the architects McKim, Mead & White. Columbia's main campus occupies more than six city blocks, or 32 acres (13 ha), in Morningside Heights, New York City, a neighborhood that contains a number of academic institutions. The university owns over 7,800 apartments in Morningside Heights, housing faculty, graduate students, and staff. Almost two dozen undergraduate dormitories (purpose-built or converted) are located on campus or in Morningside Heights. Columbia University has an extensive tunnel system, more than a century old, with the oldest portions predating the present campus. Some of these remain accessible to the public, while others have been cordoned off.[94]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nMorningside Heights\n |\n| --- |\n| Manhattan, New York City\n |\n| Parks and recreation | * Morningside Park\n* Riverside Park\n* Sakura Park\n | ![Riverside Church](image)![Low Library, Columbia University](image)\n |\n| Education | * Bank Street College of Education\n* Barnard College\n* Cathedral School\n* Columbia University\n* International House of New York\n* Jewish Theological Seminary of America\n* Manhattan School of Music\n* St. Hilda's & St. Hugh's School\n* Teachers College\n* Union Theological Seminary\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Campus | * Broadway Hall\n* Brooks and Hewitt Halls\n* Casa Italiana\n* Delta Psi, Alpha Chapter building\n* Earl Hall\n* East Campus\n* Gottesman Libraries\n* Low Memorial Library\n* Milbank, Brinckerhoff, and Fiske Halls\n* Philosophy Hall\n* Pupin Hall\n* Students' Hall\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nUniversity alumni have also been very prominent in the film industry, with 33 alumni and former students winning a combined 43 Academy Awards (as of 2011[update]).[269] Some notable Columbia alumni that have gone on to work in film include directors Sidney Lumet (*12 Angry Men*)[333] and Kathryn Bigelow (*The Hurt Locker*),[334] screenwriters Howard Koch (*Casablanca*)[335] and Joseph L.

Wien Stadium as well as facilities for field sports, outdoor track, and tennis. There is a third campus on the west bank of the Hudson River, the 157-acre (64 ha) Lamont–Doherty Earth Observatory and Earth Institute in Palisades, New York. A fourth is the 60-acre (24 ha) Nevis Laboratories in Irvington, New York, for the study of particle and motion physics. A satellite site in Paris holds classes at Reid Hall.[12]\n\n\n\n### Sustainability[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn April 2007, the university purchased more than two-thirds of a 17 acres (6.9 ha) site for a new campus in Manhattanville, an industrial neighborhood to the north of the Morningside Heights campus. Stretching from 125th Street to 133rd Street, Columbia Manhattanville houses buildings for Columbia's Business School, School of International and Public Affairs, Columbia School of the Arts, and the Jerome L. Greene Center for Mind, Brain, and Behavior, where research will occur on neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's.[108][109] The $7 billion expansion plan included demolishing all buildings, except three that are historically significant (the Studebaker Building, Prentis Hall, and the Nash Building), eliminating the existing light industry and storage warehouses, and relocating tenants in 132 apartments. Replacing these buildings created 6.8 million square feet (630,000 m2) of space for the university. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nColumbia University| ![](image)Coat of arms\n |\n| Latin: *Universitas Columbiae* |\n| Former names\n | King's College(1754–1784)Columbia College(1784–1896)[1]: 53–60 |\n| Motto | *In lumine Tuo videbimus lumen* (Latin) |\n| Motto in English\n | \"In Thy light shall we see light\"[2] |\n| Type | Private research university |\n| Established | May 25, 1754; 270 years ago (1754-05-25) |\n| Accreditation | MSCHE |\n| Academic affiliations\n | * AAU\n* NAICU\n* URA\n* Space-grant\n |\n| Endowment | $13.3 billion (2022)[3] |\n| President | Minouche Shafik |\n| Provost | Dennis Mitchell |\n| Academic staff\n | 4,370[4] |\n| Students | 34,782 (Fall 2022)[5] |\n| Undergraduates | 6,668 (Fall 2022)[n 1][5] |\n| Postgraduates | 25,880 (Fall 2022)[5] |\n| Location | New York\n, New York\n, United States\n40°48′27″N 73°57′43″W﻿ / ﻿40.80750°N 73.96194°W﻿ / 40.80750; -73.96194 |\n| Campus | Large city, 299 acres (1.21 km2) |\n| Newspaper | *Columbia Daily Spectator* |\n| Colors | Columbia blue and white[8]    |\n| Nickname | Lions |\n| Sporting affiliations\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n112. **^** Astor, Maggie; Kim Kirschenbaum (December 18, 2008). \"M'ville Expansion Clears Last Major Hurdle, State Approves Eminent Domain\". *Columbia Spectator*.

McKim, Mead & White invited French to build the sculpture in order to harmonize with the larger composition of the court and library in the center of the campus. Draped in an academic gown, the female figure of Alma Mater wears a crown of laurels and sits on a throne. The scroll-like arms of the throne end in lamps, representing sapientia and doctrina. A book signifying knowledge, balances on her lap, and an owl, the attribute of wisdom, is hidden in the folds of her gown. Her right hand holds a scepter composed of four sprays of wheat, terminating with a crown of King's College which refers to Columbia's origin as a royal charter institution in 1754. A local actress named Mary Lawton was said to have posed for parts of the sculpture. The statue was dedicated on September 23, 1903, as a gift of Mr. & Mrs. Robert Goelet, and was originally covered in golden leaf. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Access to Columbia is enhanced by the 116th Street–Columbia University subway station (1 train) on the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line.\nAccording to the A. W. Kuchler U.S. potential natural vegetation types, Columbia University would have a dominant vegetation type of Appalachian Oak (*104*) with a dominant vegetation form of Eastern Hardwood Forest (*25*).[121]\n\n\n\n### Transportation[edit]\n\n\nColumbia Transportation is the bus service of the university, operated by Academy Bus Lines. The buses are open to all Columbia faculty, students, Dodge Fitness Center members, and anyone else who holds a Columbia ID card. In addition, all TSC students can ride the buses.[122]\n\n\nIn the New York City Subway, the ![\"1\" train](image) train serves the university at 116th Street-Columbia University. The M4, M104 and M60 buses stop on Broadway while the M11 stops on Amsterdam Avenue.\n\n\n\n## Academics[edit]\n\n\n### Undergraduate admissions and financial aid[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Van Amringe Quadrangle and Memorial\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDuring the Columbia University protests of 1968 a bomb damaged the sculpture, but it has since been repaired.[104] The small hidden owl on the sculpture is also the subject of many Columbia legends, the main legend being that the first student in the freshmen class to find the hidden owl on the statue will be valedictorian, and that any subsequent Columbia male who finds it will marry a Barnard student, given that Barnard is a women's college.[105][106]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nColumbia is organized into twenty schools, including four undergraduate schools and 16 graduate schools. The university's research efforts include the Lamont–Doherty Earth Observatory, the Goddard Institute for Space Studies, and accelerator laboratories with Big Tech firms such as Amazon and IBM.[10][11] Columbia is a founding member of the Association of American Universities and was the first school in the United States to grant the MD degree.[12] The university also annually administers the Pulitzer Prize. Its endowment stands at $13.3 billion as of 2022[update], which is among the largest of any academic institution.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 2006, the university established the Office of Environmental Stewardship to initiate, coordinate and implement programs to reduce the university's environmental footprint. The U.S. Green Building Council selected the university's Manhattanville plan for the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Neighborhood Design pilot program. The plan commits to incorporating smart growth, new urbanism and \"green\" building design principles.[116] Columbia is one of the 2030 Challenge Partners, a group of nine universities in the city of New York that have pledged to reduce their greenhouse emissions by 30% within the next ten years. Columbia University adopts LEED standards for all new construction and major renovations. The university requires a minimum of Silver, but through its design and review process seeks to achieve higher levels. \n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_QyjEgUWlplnaAfr5OTVNqgCj","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

The large campus is home to deer, owls, ravens, squirrels and many other wild animals native to the area. A large population of domestic rabbits was previously a feature of the campus. In May 2010, the university began trapping and euthanizing the rabbits[30] as they had been known to put athletes at risk in the playing fields and cause extensive damage to university grounds.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)The university's cluster neighbourhood comprises 121 apartments and townhouses for student living.\nThe University of Victoria maintains several residence halls on campus, which were originally based on the Oxbridge Collegiate model of constituent colleges which serve as a smaller, more personal home environment to the students of the wider university. The university no longer operates these halls as individual colleges, but rather as halls of residences (as well as dormitories and apartments) as part of the Residence Life and Education department. Today, all halls of residence are equipped with Common Rooms and high-speed internet for students.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe University of Victoria's campus was originally designed by American architectural firm Wurster, Bernardi & Emmons, which had previously achieved fame for having completed major buildings at Stanford University and UC Berkeley. The principles and concept of the original design are still being followed, with the academic portions of the campus located inside the Ring Road, forming a perfect circle 600 m (1,969 ft) in diameter.[24]\n\n\nThe following is a list of prominent buildings on the University of Victoria campus:[25]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe university has over 88,000 alumni.

Simpson Field Studies Resource Center in Lake Cowichan.[22] Despite its name, no part of the university's main campus is located in the City of Victoria proper, instead split between the municipalities of Saanich and Oak Bay.[23] The campus is several hundred feet from the Pacific Ocean at Cadboro Bay. The six-hectare Queenswood campus was acquired from the Sisters of St. Ann and converted into a national laboratory.
