He had an early breakthrough on the professional tour as well, becoming one of the youngest Challenger Tour title winners in history at the age of 17. As a teenager, Zverev won two ATP titles and upset then-world No. 3 Roger Federer on grass. At 20 years old, he became the youngest player to debut in the top 20 since Novak Djokovic. At the Laver Cup, Zverev has played an instrumental role in Team Europe's early success in the competition, winning the clinching matches in 2018 and 2019. After reaching his career-best results in 2021 and 2022, he suffered an ankle injury at the French Open, from which he has gradually recovered.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and background[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAlexander Zverev was born on 20 April 1997 in Hamburg, Germany to Russian parents Irina Zvereva and Alexander Mikhailovich Zverev. His older brother, Mischa, born nearly a decade earlier, is also a professional tennis player. Both of his parents were professional tennis players for the Soviet Union. His father, ranked as high as No. 175 in the world, became the top-ranked men's player nationally, while his mother was the fourth highest ranked women's player in the Soviet Union. They both moved from Sochi to the capital to train at the CSKA Moscow military-run tennis club. The Soviet government often restricted their players from competing outside the country, an impediment that limited how high either of Alexander's parents could rise in the world rankings. With the collapse of the Soviet Union imminent, Irina went to Germany to compete at a tournament in 1990, with her husband accompanying as her coach. While in Germany, they were offered jobs as tennis instructors. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAlexander Zverev| ![](image)Zverev at the 2023 Monte-Carlo Masters\n |\n| Country\u00a0(sports) | ![](image)\u00a0Germany |\n| Residence | Monte Carlo, Monaco |\n| Born |  (1997-04-20) 20 April 1997 (age\u00a027)[1]Hamburg, Germany |\n| Height | 1.98\u00a0m (6\u00a0ft 6\u00a0in) |\n| Turned\u00a0pro | 2013 |\n| Plays | Right-handed (two-handed backhand) |\n| Coach | Alexander Zverev Sr. |\n| Prize money | $36,724,367[2]* 6th\u00a0all-time\u00a0in\u00a0earnings\n |\n| Singles |\n| Career\u00a0record | 394\u2013177 (69.0%) (at ATP Tour level, Grand Slam level, and in Davis Cup) |\n| Career\u00a0titles | 21 |\n| Highest\u00a0ranking | No. 2 (13 June 2022) |\n| Current\u00a0ranking | No. 7 (20 November 2023)[3] |\n| Grand Slam singles results |\n| Australian\u00a0Open | SF (2020) |\n| French\u00a0Open | SF (2021, 2022, 2023) |\n| Wimbledon | 4R (2017, 2021) |\n| US Open | F (2020) |\n| Other tournaments |\n| Tour\u00a0Finals | **W** (2018, 2021) |\n| Olympic\u00a0Games | ![](image) (2020) |\n| Doubles |\n| Career\u00a0record | 60\u201370 (46.2%) (at ATP Tour level, Grand Slam level, and in Davis Cup) |\n| Career\u00a0titles | 2 |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Alexander Zverev at the Association of Tennis Professionals ![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\n* Alexander Zverev at the International Tennis Federation ![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\n* Alexander Zverev at the Davis Cup ![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\n* Alexander Zverev at Olympics.com\n* Alexander Zverev at Olympedia ![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\n* Alexander Zverev at ESPN.com ![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\n* Alexander Zverev at IMDb\n* Alexander Zverev on Facebook (in English)\n\n\n\n\n| Awards and achievements\n |\n| --- |\n| Preceded\u00a0by![Canada](image) Filip Peliwo\n |  **ITF Junior World Champion** 2013\n | Succeeded\u00a0by![Russia](image) Andrey Rublev\n |\n| Preceded\u00a0by![Croatia](image) Borna \u0106ori\u0107\n |  **ATP Star of Tomorrow** 2015 | Succeeded\u00a0by![United States](image) Taylor Fritz\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Articles and topics related to Alexander Zverev\n |\n| --- |\n| | Alexander Zverev Achievements\n |\n| --- |\n| | * v\n* t\n* e\nOlympic tennis men's singles champions\n |\n| --- |\n| Demonstration | * 1968: ![](image)\u00a0Manuel Santana\u00a0(ESP)\n* 1984: ![](image)\u00a0Stefan Edberg\u00a0(SWE)\n |\n| Indoor | * 1908: ![](image)\u00a0Arthur Gore\u00a0(GBR)\n* 1912: ![](image)\u00a0Andr\u00e9 Gobert\u00a0(FRA)\n |\n| Outdoor | * 1896: ![](image)\u00a0John Pius Boland\u00a0(GBR)\n* 1900: ![](image)\u00a0Laurence Doherty\u00a0(GBR)\n* 1904: ![](image)\u00a0Beals Wright\u00a0(USA)\n* 1908: ![](image)\u00a0Major Ritchie\u00a0(GBR)\n* 1912: ![](image)\u00a0Charles Winslow\u00a0(RSA)\n* 1920: ![](image)\u00a0Louis Raymond\u00a0(RSA)\n* 1924: ![](image)\u00a0Vincent Richards\u00a0(USA)\n* 1988: ![](image)\u00a0Miloslav Me\u010d\u00ed\u0159\u00a0(TCH)\n* 1992: ![](image)\u00a0Marc Rosset\u00a0(SUI)\n* 1996: ![](image)\u00a0Andre Agassi\u00a0(USA)\n* 2000: ![](image)\u00a0Yevgeny Kafelnikov\u00a0(RUS)\n* 2004: ![](image)\u00a0Nicol\u00e1s Mass\u00fa\u00a0(CHI)\n* 2008: ![](image)\u00a0Rafael Nadal\u00a0(ESP)\n* 2012: ![](image)\u00a0Andy Murray\u00a0(GBR)\n* 2016: ![](image)\u00a0Andy Murray\u00a0(GBR)\n* 2020: ![](image)\u00a0Alexander Zverev\u00a0(GER)\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAt the age of 17 years and 2 months, he became the youngest player to win a Challenger title since Bernard Tomic in 2009 and the twelfth youngest in history.[27] Zverev followed up this title with a breakthrough at the ATP Tour level. He entered the International German Open having never won an ATP match but managed to reach the semifinals. He recorded four match wins at the event, including his first career victory against Robin Haase and his first top 20 victory over No. 16 Mikhail Youzhny before losing to No. 7 David Ferrer. He became the first 17-year old to defeat a top 20 opponent since Richard Gasquet in 2004 and the first to make a semifinal since Marin \u010cili\u0107 in 2006.[28] Zverev had risen from No. 665 to No. 285 after his Challenger title, and his ATP 500 Series semifinal appearance took him to No. 161 in the world. He finished the season ranked No. 136.[29]\n\n\n\n### 2015: ATP doubles final, top 100[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter the US Open, Zverev returned to Europe and won his first career ATP title at the St. Petersburg Open. He recorded his first win over No. 9 Berdych in the semifinals, and No. 3 Stan Wawrinka in the final, coming back from 0\u20133 down in the third set.[53] At his next event, he then defeated No. 10 Thiem in the first round of the 2016 China Open for the first time in four tries this year. In doing so, Zverev became the first teenager to record three consecutive victories against top ten opponents since Boris Becker in 1986.[54][55] Zverev's third round appearance at the Shanghai Masters then helped him rise to No. 20 in the ATP rankings, making him the youngest player to debut in the top 20 since Novak Djokovic in 2006.[56]\n\n\n\n![](image)Zverev at the 2016 US Open\n### 2017: Two Masters titles, world No. 3[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nGerman tennis player (born 1997)\n\nThis article is about the German tennis player.

As a result of this run he equaled his singles career-high ranking of World No. 3 on 8 November 2021.\n\n\nFor a fifth successive season, Zverev qualified for the 2021 ATP Finals in Turin, as the third seed. He began his campaign by defeating home favourite Matteo Berrettini who retired with an injury.[151] On his way to the title he defeated the top two seeds Djokovic and Medvedev in the semifinals and finals respectively.[152] Due to this win, he became the only player active to have won multiple ATP Finals titles (2) other than Djokovic and Roger Federer, with 6 and 6, respectively.\n\n\n\n### 2022: First top-10 win at a major, world No. 2, ankle injury[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n268. **^** \"Model's baby reveal amid toxic tennis spat\". *News.com.au*. 13 March 2021.

During the European clay court season, he won his first Grade 1 title over Andrey Rublev at the Open International Junior de Beaulieu-sur-Mer.[13] He followed up that performance with his first Grade A title at the Trofeo Bonfiglio a month later, becoming the youngest boys' singles champion in the tournament's history.[14] He also finished runner-up at the 2013 French Open to Cristian Gar\u00edn.[15][16] Zverev had some grass court success as well, finishing runner-up to Nick Kyrgios at the Junior International Roehampton.[17] However, he needed to retire at Wimbledon due to a shoulder injury.[18] Zverev came close to reaching another major boys' singles final at the 2013 Junior US Open, but was defeated by the eventual champion Borna \u0106ori\u0107 in the semifinals.[19] This success was enough for him to take over the No. 1 ranking in late October. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nZverev's next breakthrough came during the grass court season at the Halle Open, where he upset world No. 3 Roger Federer in the semifinals, ending Federer's streak of ten consecutive appearances in the final while competing at the tournament.[48] He was also the first teenager to defeat Federer since Murray nearly a decade earlier.[47] Nonetheless, he finished runner-up at the event to veteran compatriot Florian Mayer.[49] After this final, he entered the top 30 for the first time and stayed ranked in the 20s for the rest of the season.[29] Despite being seeded at a major tournament for the first time, Zverev could then only match his best major singles result at Wimbledon, again falling to Berdych.[50] During the US Open Series, he reached the semifinals of the Washington Open,[51] but lost his opening round matches at both Masters events. He was then upset in the second round of the US Open by Dan Evans.[52]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Zverev at the 2015 US Open\nAt the beginning of the season, Zverev was still ranked too low to receive direct entry into the main draws of ATP Tour events, which forced him to continue playing Challenger events through July. He also needed to enter qualifying for ATP events throughout the year. Zverev did not qualify for either of the first two major singles events of the season.[23] He was able to qualify for his first Masters event at the Miami Open and reached the second round.[30] During the clay-court season, Zverev partnered with his brother Mischa to reach his first career ATP final in doubles at the Bavarian International Tennis Championships. The Zverev brothers finished runner-up to top-seeded Alexander Peya and Bruno Soares.[31] Later that month, he won his second career Challenger title at the Heilbronn Neckarcup to crack the top 100 of the ATP rankings.[32]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nZverev's first appearance on grass started with a tournament at home in Halle \u2013 he lost in the second round to the eventual tournament winner Ugo Humbert. At Wimbledon, seeded No. 4, he equaled his best achievement at the tournament to date \u2013 reaching the fourth round for a second time. Along the way he defeated Tallon Griekspoor, Tennys Sandgren and Taylor Fritz. He was defeated in the fourth round by F\u00e9lix Auger-Aliassime in five sets. Following this run he returned to the top 5 after 2 years on 12 July 2021.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAfter the Australian Open, Zverev played at the Open Sud de France. As the top seed, he made it to the final where he lost to sixth seed Alexander Bublik.[158] Seeded second at the Mexican Open, Zverev played in what was the record latest match ever played, defeating Jenson Brooksby at 4:55 A.M.[159] He was then defaulted from the tournament ahead of his following match against compatriot, Peter Gojowczyk, for violently and repeatedly hitting the umpire's chair with his racket after his loss in doubles;[160] the forfeiture of his tournament ranking points meant he did not reach the world No. 1 ranking as anticipated. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nWorld Top 10 tennis players as of 10\u00a0June\u00a02024[update]\n |\n| --- |\n| |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ATP singles | ATP doubles | WTA singles | WTA doubles |\n| 1. ![Italy](image)Found atpsingles, Jannik Sinner\n2. ![Spain](image)Found atpsingles, Carlos Alcaraz\n3. ![Serbia](image)Found atpsingles, Novak Djokovic\n4. ![Germany](image)Found atpsingles, Alexander Zverev\n5. ![](image)Found atpsingles, Daniil Medvedev\n6. ![](image)Found atpsingles, Andrey Rublev\n7. ![Norway](image)Found atpsingles, Casper Ruud\n8. ![Poland](image)Found atpsingles, Hubert Hurkacz\n9. ![Australia](image)Found atpsingles, Alex de Minaur\n10. ![Bulgaria](image)Found atpsingles, Grigor Dimitrov\n | 1. ![Australia](image)Found atpsingles, Matthew Ebden\n2. ![Spain](image)Found atpsingles, Marcel Granollers\n3. ![Argentina](image)Found atpsingles, Horacio Zeballos\n4. ![India](image)Found atpsingles, Rohan Bopanna\n5. ![United Kingdom](image)Found atpsingles, Joe Salisbury\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWith Zverev's height of 1.98 metres (6\u00a0ft 6\u00a0in), he can generate big serves at 220 kilometres per hour (140\u00a0mph) or faster at sharper angles than shorter players.[7] The year Zverev first broke into the top 20, he was still not one of the better servers on tour, ranking just 38th in serve rating. This was well behind him ranking 18th in return rating, showing that his return game was much stronger than his serving.[250] By 2018, he had improved in both categories, ranking 19th in serve rating and 8th in return rating. Zverev excels in particular at hitting a high percentage of first serves in, landing 64.2% in 2018. In his return game, he had the fifth highest percentage of first serve points won that year at 32.4%.[251][252] His second serve is much more shaky and exploitable. Zverev hit the most double faults hit on tour in 2016 and 2020.[253]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n247. **^** \"Medvedev, Rublev propel Russia to first ATP Cup final\". *www.atpcup.com*.

In the third round, he beat Adrian Mannarino in four sets before beating Alejandro Davidovich Fokina in straight sets. In the quarterfinals, he beat Borna \u0106ori\u0107 in four sets to reach his second major semifinal. There, he lost the first two sets to Pablo Carre\u00f1o Busta, but came back to win the match in five; this was his first-ever match win from two sets down. He thus advanced to his first major final, where he faced Dominic Thiem. He became the runner-up, losing the final in a final-set tiebreaker despite leading by two sets and twice coming within two points of the title in the final set.[128]\n\n\nZverev was seeded 6th at the French Open. He beat Dennis Novak, Pierre-Hugues Herbert, and Marco Cecchinato, before losing in four sets to Jannik Sinner.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWith a higher ranking, Zverev was directly accepted into Wimbledon. A week before the tournament, he took part in the Boodles Challenge exhibition and surprisingly upset world No. 1 Novak Djokovic in straight sets.[33] Zverev backed up this performance in his Grand Slam tournament main draw debut, defeating Teymuraz Gabashvili in a tight match that lasted until 9\u20137 in the fifth and final set.[34] He lost in the next round to Denis Kudla. Zverev opted to play on clay after Wimbledon and reached another ATP semifinal at the Swedish Open to put him back in the top 100 after one week out.[35][29] In August, Zverev returned to the United States and competed in two US Open Series events. He notably upset No. 14 Kevin Anderson at the Citi Open en route to the quarterfinals.[36][37] Zverev's brief rankings drop in July meant that he needed to qualify for the US Open. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n28. **^** Rothenberg, Ben (19 July 2014). \"Teenagers Zverev and Konjuh Find Success in a Veteran-Dominated Sport\". *New York Times*.

It was at this time Zverev, who had been using his nickname Sascha, stated in a postmatch interview with Pam Shriver, that he would no longer be referred to as Sascha. Zverev stated that only his close family can refer to him as Sascha, as he was born in Germany and identifies as a German, and does not want a Russian nickname to be used for his professional career. At the Australian Open, Zverev again pushed Rafael Nadal to the brink, but ultimately lost in five sets.[57] His next ATP tournament was the Open Sud de France, where he won both the singles and doubles events. He and his brother defeated Fabrice Martin and Daniel Nestor for Alexander's first doubles title.[58] The following month, he made his first Masters quarterfinal at the Miami Open, upsetting No. 3 Stan Wawrinka along the way.[59] Nick Kyrgios defeated him at both Masters events that month.[60]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBack on hard courts, Zverev won his last two titles of the season in August. He won the Washington Open as well as a second consecutive Masters title at the Canadian Open, only dropping a single set at each tournament in each of his opening matches.[68] Notably, he needed to save three match points in his first match in Canada against Richard Gasquet, including a 49 shot rally.[69] He then defeated Roger Federer in the final to become the first player outside of the Big Four to win multiple Masters titles in the same season since David Nalbandian in 2007.[70][71] Despite this success, he was upset in the second round of the US Open by fellow Next Gen player Borna \u0106ori\u0107.[72] At the end of the season, Zverev qualified for both the inaugural Next Generation Finals as one of the top seven 21-and-under players, and the ATP Finals as one of the top eight players in the world. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nZverev was seeded 3rd at the 2021 BNP Paribas Open, where he reached the quarterfinals. On the way, he defeated Jenson Brooksby, Andy Murray and Ga\u00ebl Monfils. He lost to Taylor Fritz, despite having two match points.[148]\n\n\nAt the Erste Bank Open in Vienna, seeded second, he defeated Filip Krajinovi\u0107 and Alex de Minaur to reach the quarterfinals. The victory over De Minaur gave Zverev his 300th ATP tour match win.[149] He then beat F\u00e9lix Auger-Aliassime and Carlos Alcaraz to reach the final where he won his fifth title of the year and 18th overall, defeating Frances Tiafoe in straight sets.[150]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nZverev began to turn his season around following Wimbledon. He reached the semifinals of the German Open and the quarterfinals at the Canadian Open.[104][105] He then reached the last 16 at the US Open for the first time, where he lost to seed No. 20 Diego Schwartzman to continue his lack of success at the major tournaments.[106] He had also fallen out of the top 5 in early August for the first time in nearly two years.[29] Zverev's best result of the season came at the Shanghai Masters. He upset No. 3 Roger Federer in the quarterfinals before finishing runner-up to No. 4 Daniil Medvedev,[107][108] who was playing in his sixth consecutive final.[109] This performance helped him qualify for the ATP Finals at the end of the year. At the event, Zverev was drawn into a round-robin group with Rafael Nadal, Stefanos Tsitsipas, and Daniil Medvedev. \n</fragment>\n</document>",

After reaching the semifinals in Washington,[53] he reached his second final of the season and first career Masters final at the Canadian Open. During the tournament, he became the youngest player to record four top ten wins in a single event, defeating No. 8 Dominic Thiem, No. 10 Novak Djokovic, No. 3 Alexander Zverev, and No. 6 Kevin Anderson in succession. He also saved match points in the latter two matches.[54][55] Tsitsipas lost the final to Nadal on his 20th birthday in a closer match than their first encounter.

He did not play in any high-level Grade A tournaments until the Abierto Juvenil Mexicano in November 2014, but was able to make it all the way to the final of his second career Grade A event at the Orange Bowl a month later.[20][21] Tsitsipas had entered the tournament ranked outside of the top 100 in the junior rankings.[22] In 2015, Tsitsipas got his first opportunity to play in the junior Grand Slam tournaments. In these four events, a quarterfinal at the Australian Open was his best result.[20] He did not win any singles finals that year, but he did have another runner-up finish at the Orange Bowl, this time losing to Miomir Kecmanovi\u0107 in a third set tiebreak.[20][23] He finished the season as the No. 14 ranked junior in the world.[24]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2016, Tsitsipas had a breakout year, reaching at least the quarterfinals of all eight tournaments that he played, including all four Grand Slams.[20] He became the top-ranked junior in the world after winning his first Grade A title at the Trofeo Bonfiglio.[25] Tsitsipas also won the European Junior Championships later in the year.[26] Tsitsipas's biggest title of the season came in doubles, when he partnered with Estonian player Kenneth Raisma to win his only junior Grand Slam event at Wimbledon.[27] He became the first male Greek to win a junior Grand Slam in the Open Era, and the second overall after Nicky Kalogeropoulos won both the French Open and Wimbledon in 1963.[11] Besides his doubles triumph, Tsitsipas also had his two best finishes in the Grand Slam singles events that year, making the semifinals of both Wimbledon and the US Open.[28][29] He ended the year as the No. 2 ranked junior in the world, behind only Kecmanovi\u0107 who had played several more events.[30]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n69. **^** Crouse, Karen (20 January 2019). \"Roger Federer Knocked From Australian Open by Stefanos Tsitsipas, Age 20\". *New York Times*.

I remember watching games on TV, as a baby, I can not tell you who was playing, but I remember watching.\"[11] He also participated in other sports as a kid, including football and swimming. His father said Stefanos made the decision to become a tennis player himself, recalling that his son \"woke up in the middle of the night\" after a tournament in France at age nine and told him \"Dad, I have to tell you something: I want to become a tennis player, I like the competition, I like the challenge.\"[13][14]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nGreek tennis player (born 1998)\n\n\"Tsitsipas\" redirects here.

During the ATP 500 Series tournament, he defeated three top 20 players including No. 7 Thiem, before losing to world No. 1 Rafael Nadal in a lopsided match. With this result, Tsitsipas moved into the top 50 and became the second Greek to reach an ATP final after Nicky Kalogeropoulos in 1973.[47] His performance also gained national attention in Greece, where tennis is not a widely popular sport.[48][10] The following week at the Estoril Open, he reached another semifinal. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Articles and topics related to Stefanos Tsitsipas\n |\n| --- |\n| | Stefanos Tsitsipas Achievements\n |\n| --- |\n| | * v\n* t\n* e\nYear-end championships men's singles champions\n |\n| --- |\n| * 1970: Stan Smith\n* 1971: Ilie N\u0103stase\n* 1972: Ilie N\u0103stase\n* 1973: Ilie N\u0103stase\n* 1974: Guillermo Vilas\n* 1975: Ilie N\u0103stase\n* 1976: Manuel Orantes\n* 1977: Jimmy Connors\n* 1978: John McEnroe\n* 1979: Bj\u00f6rn Borg\n* 1980: Bj\u00f6rn Borg\n* 1981: Ivan Lendl\n* 1982: Ivan Lendl\n* 1983: John McEnroe\n* 1984: John McEnroe\n* 1985: Ivan Lendl\n* 1986: Ivan Lendl\n* 1987: Ivan Lendl\n* 1988: Boris Becker\n* 1989: Stefan Edberg\n* 1990: Andre Agassi\n* 1991: Pete Sampras\n* 1992: Boris Becker\n* 1993: Michael Stich\n* 1994: Pete Sampras\n* 1995: Boris Becker\n* 1996: Pete Sampras\n* 1997: Pete Sampras\n* 1998: Alex Corretja\n* 1999: Pete Sampras\n* 2000: Gustavo Kuerten\n* 2001: Lleyton Hewitt\n* 2002: Lleyton Hewitt\n* 2003: Roger Federer\n* 2004: Roger Federer\n* 2005: David Nalbandian\n* 2006: Roger Federer\n* 2007: Roger Federer\n* 2008: Novak Djokovic\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nTsitsipas built on his Grand Slam success by reaching two finals in February in back-to-back weeks.
