          "content": "<document>\n<title>The World's Billionaires</title>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the 32nd annual *Forbes* list of the world's billionaires, the aggregate wealth of the top 20 richest people on Earth amounted to about 13 percent of all billionaires' fortunes combined.[15] A record of 2,208 billionaires were in the ranking and the total wealth was $9.1 trillion, up 18% since 2017. For the first time, Jeff Bezos was listed as the top billionaire due to Amazon's rising stock price that resulted in one person's biggest one-year gain in wealth ($35 billion) since *Forbes* started tracking in 1987.[15] The U.S. had the most billionaires in the world, with 585, while China was catching up with 476 when including Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan; it had 372 when excluding those three places.[15] Forbes excluded Al-Walid bin Talal and all other Saudi billionaires due to the absence of accurate wealth estimations as a result of the 2017\u201319 Saudi Arabian purge.[16]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the 37th annual *Forbes* list of the world's billionaires, the list included 2,640 billionaires with a total net wealth of $12.2 trillion, down 28 members and $500 billion from 2022. Over half of the list is less wealthy compared to the previous year, including Elon Musk, who fell from No. 1 to No. 2.[2] The list also marks for the first time a French citizen was in the top position as well as a non-American for the first time since 2013 when the Mexican Carlos Slim Helu was the world's richest person. The list, like in 2022, counted 15 under 30 billionaires with the richest of them being Red Bull heir Mark Mateschitz with a net worth of $34.7 billion. The youngest of the lot were Clemente Del Vecchio, heir to the Luxottica fortune shared with his six siblings and stepmother, and Kim Jung-yang, whose fortune lies in Japanese-South Korean gaming giant Nexon, both under-20s.[10]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n5. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** Kroll, Luisa. \"Forbes 2017 billionaires list: Meet the richest people on the planet\". *Forbes*.

When he was designated the \"world wealthiest person\" on March 6, 2018, the *Forbes* The World's Billionaires list stipulated that although Bezos was the first centi-billionaire (i.e. +US$100\u00a0billion in net worth), it was Bill Gates who had the most money when taken in real terms.[221] In such terms, Gates had $150\u00a0billion while Bezos had $100\u00a0billion. However, in July 2018, the net worth of Bezos officially surpassed the $150\u00a0billion mark, which led most major wealth indexes to label him the wealthiest person in modern history (post-1982).[222]\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
