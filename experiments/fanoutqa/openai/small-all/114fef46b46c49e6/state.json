Meanwhile, Prussian worries about the growing French influence in Central Europe sparked the War of the Fourth Coalition in 1806.\n\n\n\n\n## Periodisation[edit]\n\n\nHistorians differ on when the War of the Third Coalition began and when it ended. From the British perspective, the war started when Britain declared war on France on 18 May 1803, but it was still on its own. It was not until December 1804 when Sweden entered into an alliance with the United Kingdom, not until 11 April 1805 when Russia joined the alliance, not until 16 July when Britain and Russia ratified their treaty of alliance, and only thereafter Austria (9 August) and Naples\u2013Sicily (11 September) completed the fully-fledged coalition.[1]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n1805\u20131806 conflict during the Napoleonic Wars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| War of the Third Coalition |\n| --- |\n| Part of the Napoleonic Wars and the Coalition Wars |\n| ![War of the third coalition](image)War of the third coalition\nClick an image to load the appropriate article.Left to right, top to bottom:Battles of Ulm, Trafalgar, Durenstein, Sch\u00f6ngrabern and Austerlitz |\n| \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Date | 11 April 1805 \u2013 18 July 1806(1 year and 3 months) |\n| Location | * + Central Europe\n\t+ Italy\n\t+ Atlantic Ocean\n |\n| Result | French victory\n* Treaty of Pressburg\n* Consolidation of the French Empire\n* Creation of the Confederation of the Rhine\n* French conquest of Naples\n* Dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire\n* British naval supremacy confirmed\n* Formation of the Fourth Coalition a few months later\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| France,client statesand allies | * France\n* Polish Legions\n* Italy\n* Holland\n* Etruria\n* Swiss Confederation\n* Naples\n* Confederation of the Rhine\n\t+ Bavaria\n\t+ Saxony\n\t+ Westphalia\n\t+ W\u00fcrttemberg\n* Denmark\u2013Norway\n* Ottoman Empire\n* Persia\n* Spain\n |\n| Coalitionforces | * United Kingdom\n* Austria\n* Russia\n* Prussia\n* Spain\n* Portugal\n* Sicily\n* Papal States\n* Ottoman Empire\n* Persia\n* Sardinia\n* Sweden\n* Netherlands\n* Brunswick\n* Hanover\n* Nassau\n* French Royalists\n |\n\n |\n| Majorbattles | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThis narrative leaves out the subsequent French invasion of Naples (February\u2013July 1806), which the occupying Anglo-Russian troops hastily evacuated and the remaining Neapolitan forces relatively quickly surrendered. Other scholars argue the southern Italian campaign should be included into the War of the Second Coalition, and criticise ignoring the Mediterranean front by only focusing on land battles in Central Europe and the Trafalgar campaign.[3]\n\n\n\n## Prelude[edit]\n\n\nEurope had been embroiled in the French Revolutionary Wars since 1792. After five years of war, the French Republic subdued the armies of the First Coalition in 1797. A Second Coalition was formed in 1798, but this too was defeated by 1801, leaving Britain the only opponent of the new French Consulate.[4]\n\n\n\n### From Amiens to the Third Coalition[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMeanwhile, Bavaria sided with France on 25 August, and W\u00fcrttemberg joined Napoleon on 5 September. No major hostilities between France and any member of the coalition other than Britain (Trafalgar campaign March\u2013November 1805) occurred until the Ulm Campaign (25 September \u2013 20 October 1805). This was in part because Napoleon's planned invasion of the United Kingdom was not called off until 27 August 1805, when he decided to use his invasion force camped at Boulogne against Austria instead.[1]\n\n\nLikewise, no major battles occurred after the Battle of Austerlitz and the signing of the Peace of Pressburg on 26 December 1805, which forced Austria to leave the Third Coalition and cease hostilities against France. Some historians conclude that Austria's departure \"shattered the fragile Third Coalition\"[1] and \"ended the War of the Third Coalition\".[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Third Coalition itself came to full fruition in 1804\u201305 as Napoleon's actions in Italy and Germany (notably the arrest and execution of the Duc d'Enghien) spurred Austria and Russia into joining Britain against France. The war would be determined on the continent, and the major land operations that sealed the swift French victory involved the Ulm Campaign, a large wheeling manoeuvre by the *Grande Arm\u00e9e* lasting from late August to mid-October 1805 that captured an entire Austrian army, and the decisive French victory over a combined Austro-Russian force under Alexander I of Russia at the Battle of Austerlitz in early December. Austerlitz effectively brought the Third Coalition to an end, although later there was a small side campaign against Naples, which also resulted in a decisive French victory at the Battle of Campo Tenese.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Belligerents |\n| * ![Austrian Empire](image) Austrian Empire\n* ![United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland](image) United Kingdom\n* ![Russian Empire](image) Russia\n* ![](image) Naples\n* ![Kingdom of Sicily](image) Sicily\n* ![Sweden](image) Sweden\n | ![First French Empire](image) First French Empire\n* ![Batavian Republic](image) Batavian Republic\n* ![Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)](image) Italy\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| **Austrian Empire:**20,000 killed or wounded70,000 captured**Russia:**25,000 killed or wounded25,000 captured**Naples:**20,000 killed, wounded or captured**Total casualties:**160,000 killed, wounded or captured | **France:**13,500 killed37,000 wounded5,000 captured**Italy:**350 killed1,900 wounded**Spain:**1,200 killed1,600 wounded**Bavaria:**300 killed1,200 wounded\n\n---\n\n**Total casualties:**62,050 killed, wounded or captured |\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nWar of the Third Coalition\n |\n| --- |\n| German campaign\n* Bavaria\n* **Ulm campaign**\n\t+ Donauw\u00f6rth\n\t+ Wertingen\n\t+ G\u00fcnzburg\n\t+ Haslach-Jungingen\n\t+ Memmingen\n\t+ Elchingen\n\t+ Ulm\n* Mehrnbach\n* Lambach\n* Steyr\n* Amstetten\n* Mariazell\n* D\u00fcrenstein\n* Dornbirn\n* Sch\u00f6ngrabern\n* Hanover\n* Wischau\n* **Austerlitz**\n\n\nItalian campaign\n* Verona\n* Caldiero\n* Forano\n* Caldiero pursuit\n* Castelfranco Veneto\n\n\nInvasion of Naples\n* Gaeta\n* Campo Tenese\n* Maida\n* Calabria\n* Mileto\n\n\nTrafalgar campaign\n* Diamond Rock\n* Cape Finisterre\n* **Trafalgar**\n* Cape Ortegal\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| French and allymilitary andpolitical leaders | * Napoleon\n* Louis-Alexandre Berthier\n* Joachim Murat\n* Louis-Nicolas Davout\n* Jean Lannes\n* Auguste de Marmont\n* Andr\u00e9 Mass\u00e9na\n* Michel Ney\n* Jean-de-Dieu Soult\n* Marshal Victor\n* Jean-Baptiste Bessi\u00e8res\n* Pierre-Charles Villeneuve\n* Joseph I\n* Louis Bonaparte\n* J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bonaparte\n* Prince Poniatowski\n* Prince Eug\u00e8ne\n* Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria\n* Frederick Augustus I of Saxony\n* Frederick I of W\u00fcrttemberg\n* Frederick VI of Denmark\n |\n| Coalitionmilitary andpolitical leaders | * Duke of Wellington\n* Rowland Hill\n* John Moore\n* Horatio Nelson\n* Thomas Cochrane\n* Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor\n* Manuel Lape\u00f1a\n* Archduke Charles\n* Prince von Schwarzenberg\n* Archduke John of Austria\n* Alexander I of Russia\n* Mikhail Kutuzov\n* Michael Andreas Barclay de Tolly\n* Count Bennigsen\n* Pyotr Bagration\n* Peter Wittgenstein\n* Frederick William III of Prussia\n* Gebhard von Bl\u00fccher\n* Duke of Brunswick\n* Prince of Hohenlohe\n* Ferdinand VII of Spain\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFollowing the surrender, Mass\u00e9na was ordered south by Joseph to support Reynier's II Corps against the British and the Calabrian insurrection. Now severely outnumbered in mainland Italy, the British retreated back to Sicily. However, the revolt was not suppressed until 1807, by which time Mass\u00e9na had already requested permission to relinquish command. For the first time in the Napoleonic Wars, the French experienced a brutal guerrilla war carried on by a rebellious population. The French gleaned that the only effective way to deal with such an uprising was to implement terror tactics employed by Reynier.

The Swedish government had broken diplomatic ties with France in early 1804 after the arrest and execution of Louis Antoine, Duke of Enghien, a royalist \u00e9migr\u00e9 who had been implicated (on dubious evidence) in an assassination plot against First Consul Bonaparte. The execution of Enghien shocked the aristocrats of Europe, who still remembered the bloodletting of the Revolution and thus lost whatever conditional respect they may have entertained for Napoleon.[9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Miguel de \u00c1lava\n* Maria I of Portugal\n* Prince Regent John of Portugal\n* Count of Feira\n* William, Prince of Orange\n* Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies\n* Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden\n* Prince Charles John of Sweden\n* Louis XVIII\n |\n| Relatedconflicts | * Anglo-Russian War\n* Anglo-Spanish War\n* Anglo-Swedish War\n* Anglo-Turkish War\n* Anglo-Danish War\n\t+ Gunboat War\n* Dano-Swedish War\n* Russo-Swedish War (Finnish War)\n* Franco-Swedish War (Pomeranian War)\n* Russo-Persian War\n* Russo-Turkish War\n* Spanish American wars of independence\n* Swedish\u2013Norwegian War\n* War of 1812\n |\n| Treaties | * Campo Formio\n* Lun\u00e9ville\n* Amiens\n* Artlenburg\n* Pressburg\n* Finckenstein\n* Tilsit\n* Cintra\n* Sch\u00f6nbrunn\n* Paris (1810)\n* Paris (February 1812)\n* Paris (March 1812)\n* Paris (1814)\n* Tauroggen\n* Ried\n* Chaumont\n* Kiel\n* Mantua\n* Casalanza\n* Fontainebleau (1814)\n* Paris (1815)\n |\n| Miscellaneous | * Bibliography\n* Bourbon Restoration\n* Casualties\n* Congress of Erfurt\n* Continental System\n* Conference of Dresden\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Marshal Murat proved instrumental during the Ulm Campaign.\n![](image)General Mack surrenders his army at Ulm.

Although they never set foot on British soil, Napoleon's troops received careful and invaluable training for any possible military operation. Boredom among the troops occasionally set in, but Napoleon paid many visits and conducted lavish parades in order to boost the morale of the soldiers.[11]\n\n\nThe men at Boulogne formed the core for what Napoleon would later call *La Grande Arm\u00e9e* (\"The Great Army\"). At the start, this French army had about 200,000 men organized into seven corps, each capable of independent action or in concert with other corps. Corps were large combined arms field units typically containing 2\u20134 infantry divisions, a cavalry division, and about 36 to 40 cannon.[12]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This article **duplicates the scope of other articles**. Please discuss this issue and help introduce a summary style to the article. *(October 2013)*\n |\n\n\nWhen the Third Coalition declared war on France after the short-lived Peace of Amiens, Napoleon Bonaparte was determined to invade Britain. To do so, he had to ensure that the Royal Navy would be unable to disrupt the invasion flotilla, which would require control of the English Channel.\n\n\nThe main French fleets were at Brest in Brittany and at Toulon on the Mediterranean coast. Other ports on the French Atlantic coast contained smaller squadrons. In addition, France and Spain were allied, so the Spanish fleet based in C\u00e1diz and Ferrol was also available.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn July 1806, Napoleon created the Confederation of the Rhine, a string of German client states which on becoming allies of France pledged themselves to raise an army of 63,000 men. With Napoleon as their \"Protector\", the confederate states were compelled to leave the Holy Roman Empire, which was dissolved shortly afterward.[67] Prussia saw these and other moves as an affront to its status as the main power of Central Europe and it went to war with France in 1806.\n\n\nIn Italy, the political situation would remain unchanged until 1815, with the British and Sicilian troops guarding the Bourbon King Ferdinand in Sicily and the Napoleonic King of Naples controlling the mainland. In 1808, Joachim Murat became the King of Naples, after Joseph Bonaparte became King of Spain. Murat made various attempts to cross the Strait of Messina, which all ended in failure, despite once managing to secure a foothold in Sicily.\n\n\n\n### Casualties and losses[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFanning the flames of the outcry resulting from d'Enghien's death and the growing fear over increasing French power, British Prime Minister William Pitt spent 1804 and 1805 in a flurry of diplomatic activity geared towards forming a new coalition against France. Pitt scored a significant coup by securing a burgeoning rival as an ally. The Baltic was dominated by Russia, something Britain had been uncomfortable with since the area provided valuable commodities like timber, tar, and hemp, crucial supplies to its Royal Navy.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Meanwhile, Prussian worries about the growing French influence in Central Europe sparked the War of the Fourth Coalition in 1806.\n\n\n\n\n## Periodisation[edit]\n\n\nHistorians differ on when the War of the Third Coalition began and when it ended. From the British perspective, the war started when Britain declared war on France on 18 May 1803, but it was still on its own. It was not until December 1804 when Sweden entered into an alliance with the United Kingdom, not until 11 April 1805 when Russia joined the alliance, not until 16 July when Britain and Russia ratified their treaty of alliance, and only thereafter Austria (9 August) and Naples\u2013Sicily (11 September) completed the fully-fledged coalition.[1]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMeanwhile, Bavaria sided with France on 25 August, and W\u00fcrttemberg joined Napoleon on 5 September. No major hostilities between France and any member of the coalition other than Britain (Trafalgar campaign March\u2013November 1805) occurred until the Ulm Campaign (25 September \u2013 20 October 1805). This was in part because Napoleon's planned invasion of the United Kingdom was not called off until 27 August 1805, when he decided to use his invasion force camped at Boulogne against Austria instead.[1]\n\n\nLikewise, no major battles occurred after the Battle of Austerlitz and the signing of the Peace of Pressburg on 26 December 1805, which forced Austria to leave the Third Coalition and cease hostilities against France. Some historians conclude that Austria's departure \"shattered the fragile Third Coalition\"[1] and \"ended the War of the Third Coalition\".[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Third Coalition itself came to full fruition in 1804\u201305 as Napoleon's actions in Italy and Germany (notably the arrest and execution of the Duc d'Enghien) spurred Austria and Russia into joining Britain against France. The war would be determined on the continent, and the major land operations that sealed the swift French victory involved the Ulm Campaign, a large wheeling manoeuvre by the *Grande Arm\u00e9e* lasting from late August to mid-October 1805 that captured an entire Austrian army, and the decisive French victory over a combined Austro-Russian force under Alexander I of Russia at the Battle of Austerlitz in early December. Austerlitz effectively brought the Third Coalition to an end, although later there was a small side campaign against Naples, which also resulted in a decisive French victory at the Battle of Campo Tenese.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| **Austrian Empire:**20,000 killed or wounded70,000 captured**Russia:**25,000 killed or wounded25,000 captured**Naples:**20,000 killed, wounded or captured**Total casualties:**160,000 killed, wounded or captured | **France:**13,500 killed37,000 wounded5,000 captured**Italy:**350 killed1,900 wounded**Spain:**1,200 killed1,600 wounded**Bavaria:**300 killed1,200 wounded\n\n---\n\n**Total casualties:**62,050 killed, wounded or captured |\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nWar of the Third Coalition\n |\n| --- |\n| German campaign\n* Bavaria\n* **Ulm campaign**\n\t+ Donauw\u00f6rth\n\t+ Wertingen\n\t+ G\u00fcnzburg\n\t+ Haslach-Jungingen\n\t+ Memmingen\n\t+ Elchingen\n\t+ Ulm\n* Mehrnbach\n* Lambach\n* Steyr\n* Amstetten\n* Mariazell\n* D\u00fcrenstein\n* Dornbirn\n* Sch\u00f6ngrabern\n* Hanover\n* Wischau\n* **Austerlitz**\n\n\nItalian campaign\n* Verona\n* Caldiero\n* Forano\n* Caldiero pursuit\n* Castelfranco Veneto\n\n\nInvasion of Naples\n* Gaeta\n* Campo Tenese\n* Maida\n* Calabria\n* Mileto\n\n\nTrafalgar campaign\n* Diamond Rock\n* Cape Finisterre\n* **Trafalgar**\n* Cape Ortegal\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThis narrative leaves out the subsequent French invasion of Naples (February\u2013July 1806), which the occupying Anglo-Russian troops hastily evacuated and the remaining Neapolitan forces relatively quickly surrendered. Other scholars argue the southern Italian campaign should be included into the War of the Second Coalition, and criticise ignoring the Mediterranean front by only focusing on land battles in Central Europe and the Trafalgar campaign.[3]\n\n\n\n## Prelude[edit]\n\n\nEurope had been embroiled in the French Revolutionary Wars since 1792. After five years of war, the French Republic subdued the armies of the First Coalition in 1797. A Second Coalition was formed in 1798, but this too was defeated by 1801, leaving Britain the only opponent of the new French Consulate.[4]\n\n\n\n### From Amiens to the Third Coalition[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| France,client statesand allies | * France\n* Polish Legions\n* Italy\n* Holland\n* Etruria\n* Swiss Confederation\n* Naples\n* Confederation of the Rhine\n\t+ Bavaria\n\t+ Saxony\n\t+ Westphalia\n\t+ W\u00fcrttemberg\n* Denmark\u2013Norway\n* Ottoman Empire\n* Persia\n* Spain\n |\n| Coalitionforces | * United Kingdom\n* Austria\n* Russia\n* Prussia\n* Spain\n* Portugal\n* Sicily\n* Papal States\n* Ottoman Empire\n* Persia\n* Sardinia\n* Sweden\n* Netherlands\n* Brunswick\n* Hanover\n* Nassau\n* French Royalists\n |\n\n |\n| Majorbattles | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| French and allymilitary andpolitical leaders | * Napoleon\n* Louis-Alexandre Berthier\n* Joachim Murat\n* Louis-Nicolas Davout\n* Jean Lannes\n* Auguste de Marmont\n* Andr\u00e9 Mass\u00e9na\n* Michel Ney\n* Jean-de-Dieu Soult\n* Marshal Victor\n* Jean-Baptiste Bessi\u00e8res\n* Pierre-Charles Villeneuve\n* Joseph I\n* Louis Bonaparte\n* J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bonaparte\n* Prince Poniatowski\n* Prince Eug\u00e8ne\n* Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria\n* Frederick Augustus I of Saxony\n* Frederick I of W\u00fcrttemberg\n* Frederick VI of Denmark\n |\n| Coalitionmilitary andpolitical leaders | * Duke of Wellington\n* Rowland Hill\n* John Moore\n* Horatio Nelson\n* Thomas Cochrane\n* Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor\n* Manuel Lape\u00f1a\n* Archduke Charles\n* Prince von Schwarzenberg\n* Archduke John of Austria\n* Alexander I of Russia\n* Mikhail Kutuzov\n* Michael Andreas Barclay de Tolly\n* Count Bennigsen\n* Pyotr Bagration\n* Peter Wittgenstein\n* Frederick William III of Prussia\n* Gebhard von Bl\u00fccher\n* Duke of Brunswick\n* Prince of Hohenlohe\n* Ferdinand VII of Spain\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFollowing the surrender, Mass\u00e9na was ordered south by Joseph to support Reynier's II Corps against the British and the Calabrian insurrection. Now severely outnumbered in mainland Italy, the British retreated back to Sicily. However, the revolt was not suppressed until 1807, by which time Mass\u00e9na had already requested permission to relinquish command. For the first time in the Napoleonic Wars, the French experienced a brutal guerrilla war carried on by a rebellious population. The French gleaned that the only effective way to deal with such an uprising was to implement terror tactics employed by Reynier. This foreshadowed the same problems the French, and in particular Joseph Bonaparte, would face in Spain during the Peninsular War.\n\n\n\n## Results[edit]\n\n\n![](image)All the participants of the War of the Third Coalition.

The Swedish government had broken diplomatic ties with France in early 1804 after the arrest and execution of Louis Antoine, Duke of Enghien, a royalist \u00e9migr\u00e9 who had been implicated (on dubious evidence) in an assassination plot against First Consul Bonaparte. The execution of Enghien shocked the aristocrats of Europe, who still remembered the bloodletting of the Revolution and thus lost whatever conditional respect they may have entertained for Napoleon.[9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Belligerents |\n| * ![Austrian Empire](image) Austrian Empire\n* ![United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland](image) United Kingdom\n* ![Russian Empire](image) Russia\n* ![](image) Naples\n* ![Kingdom of Sicily](image) Sicily\n* ![Sweden](image) Sweden\n | ![First French Empire](image) First French Empire\n* ![Batavian Republic](image) Batavian Republic\n* ![Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)](image) Italy\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Marshal Murat proved instrumental during the Ulm Campaign.\n![](image)General Mack surrenders his army at Ulm.

The Russians were still using the old style Julian calendar, while the Austrians had adopted the new style Gregorian calendar, and by 1805 a difference of 12 days existed between the two systems. Confusion is purported to have ensued from the differing timetables regarding when the Allied forces should combine, leading to an inevitable breakdown in mutual coordination.[18] However, this tale is not supported in a contemporary account from a major-general of the Austrian army, who tells of a joint advance of the Russian and Austrian forces (in which he himself took part) five days before the Battle of Austerlitz,[19]\nand it is explicitly rejected in Goetz's recent book-length study of the battle.[20]\n\n\n\n## Ulm campaign[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Ulm Campaign\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The strategic situation in Europe in 1805 before the start of the Ulm Campaign and the war\nIn August 1805, Napoleon, Emperor of the French since May of the previous year, turned his army's sights from the English Channel to the Rhine in order to deal with the new Austrian and Russian threats. The War of the Third Coalition began with the Ulm Campaign, a series of French and Bavarian military manoeuvres and battles designed to outflank an Austrian army under General Mack.\n\n\n\n### Austrian plans and preparations[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn July 1806, Napoleon created the Confederation of the Rhine, a string of German client states which on becoming allies of France pledged themselves to raise an army of 63,000 men. With Napoleon as their \"Protector\", the confederate states were compelled to leave the Holy Roman Empire, which was dissolved shortly afterward.[67] Prussia saw these and other moves as an affront to its status as the main power of Central Europe and it went to war with France in 1806.\n\n\nIn Italy, the political situation would remain unchanged until 1815, with the British and Sicilian troops guarding the Bourbon King Ferdinand in Sicily and the Napoleonic King of Naples controlling the mainland. In 1808, Joachim Murat became the King of Naples, after Joseph Bonaparte became King of Spain. Murat made various attempts to cross the Strait of Messina, which all ended in failure, despite once managing to secure a foothold in Sicily.\n\n\n\n### Casualties and losses[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMany regard this incident as one of Napoleon's cruelest acts in war.[62] However, only a few bodies are reported to have been found in the spring of 1806, and it is most likely the incident is a myth.[63]\n\n\n\n## Italian Campaigns[edit]\n\n\n### Venetian front or Italian campaign of 1805[edit]\n\n\nMeanwhile, in Italy, the Austrian *Armee von Italien* under Archduke Charles fought against the French *Arm\u00e9e d'italie* under Marshal Mass\u00e9na. The French managed to gain a bridgehead over the Adige river at Verona on 18 October, and finally, between 29 and 31 October, the outnumbered French defeated the superior Austrian army in the Battle of Caldiero. In November the Austrians retreated, engaging the French vanguard of d'Espagne in several rear-guard actions. Venice was blockaded by French and Italian troops under St.Cyr. Charles' army finally crossed the Isonzo on 14 November, preventing the French from crossing it.[64]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
