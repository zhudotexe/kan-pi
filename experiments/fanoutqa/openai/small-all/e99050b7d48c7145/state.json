Such calculations are prepared by various organizations, including the IMF and the World Bank. As estimates and assumptions have to be made, the results produced by different organizations for the same country are not hard facts and tend to differ, sometimes substantially, so they should be used with caution.\n\n\nComparisons of national wealth are frequently made on the basis of *nominal* GDP and savings (not just income), which do not reflect differences in the cost of living in different countries (*see List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita*); hence, using a PPP basis is arguably more useful when comparing generalized differences in living standards between economies because PPP takes into account the relative cost of living and the inflation rates of the countries, rather than using only exchange rates, which may distort the real differences in income.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Price level\n* Employment/Unemployment\n* Financial assets\n* Labour productivity\n* Wealth\n |\n| * Lists of countries by GDP rankings\n\n\n* List of international rankings\n* Lists by country\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Gross national income (GNI) | * Nominal per capita\n* PPP per capita\n |\n| Wages | * Average wage\n\t+ Europe\n* Employee compensation (per hour)\n* List of countries by median wage\n* Minimum wages\n\t+ Canada\n\t+ Europe\n\t+ United States\n |\n| Wealth | * Wealth per adult\n\t+ Europe\n* Financial assets per capita\n |\n| Other national accounts | * Gross National Happiness\n* Net material product\n* Research and development spending\n* Stock market capitalization\n* Patents, trademarks, and industrial design filing activity\n |\n| Human development | * Human Development Index\n\t+ by country\n\t+ inequality-adjusted\n\t+ planetary pressures\u2013adjusted HDI\n* Human Poverty Index\n* Percentage living in poverty\n* Human Capital Index\n* Household income\n* Social Progress Index\n |\n| Digital divide | * ICT Development Index\n* Number of broadband Internet subscriptions\n* Number of Internet users\n* Smartphone penetration\n |\n| Net international  investment position (NIIP) | * Per capita (creditors)\n* Per capita (debtors)\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThis is why GDP (PPP) per capita is often considered one of the indicators of a country's standard of living,[3][4] although this can be problematic because GDP per capita is not a measure of personal income.

It also excludes non-sovereign tax havens (for example, Delaware or Labuan).\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| ![](image)\u00a0Kiribati\u202f\\* | Oceania | 2,381 | 2023 | 2,365 | 2022 | 1,900 | 2021\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Eritrea\u202f\\* | Africa | \u2014 | 1,629 | 2011 | 1,600 | 2017\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Sierra Leone\u202f\\* | Africa | 2,097 | 2023 | 1,931 | 2022 | 1,600 | 2021\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Yemen\u202f\\* | Asia | 2,053 | 2023 | 3,437 | 2013 | 2,500 | 2017\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Somalia\u202f\\* | Africa | 1,998 | 2023 | 1,364 | 2022 | 1,100 | 2021\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Afghanistan\u202f\\* | Asia | 1,991 | 2021 | 1,674 | 2021 | 1,500 | 2021\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Madagascar\u202f\\* | Africa | 1,907 | 2023 | 1,774 | 2022 | 1,500 | 2021\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Chad\u202f\\* | Africa | 1,807 | 2023 | 1,668 | 2022 | 1,400 | 2021\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Liberia\u202f\\* | Africa | 1,789 | 2023 | 1,725 | 2022 | 1,400 | 2021\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0North Korea\u202f\\* | Asia | \u2014 | \u2014 | 1,700 | 2015\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Malawi\u202f\\* | Africa | 1,668 | 2023 | 1,732 | 2022 | 1,500 | 2021\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Niger\u202f\\* | Africa | 1,579 | 2023 | 1,505 | 2022 | 1,200 | 2021\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Mozambique\u202f\\* | Africa | 1,584 | 2023 | 1,468 | 2022 | 1,200 | 2021\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| ![](image)\u00a0Kuwait\u202f\\* | Asia | 51,765 | 2023 | 58,056 | 2022 | 43,900 | 2020\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Slovenia\u202f\\* | Europe | 51,407 | 2023 | 50,032 | 2022 | 40,000 | 2021\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Aruba\u202f\\* | Americas | 51,352 | 2023 | 42,698 | 2021 | 38,900 | 2021\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Guernsey\u202f\\* | Europe | \u2014 | \u2014 | 52,500 | 2014\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Spain\u202f\\* | Europe | 50,472 | 2023 | 45,825 | 2022 | 37,900 | 2021\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Lithuania\u202f\\* | Europe | 49,245 | 2023 | 48,397 | 2022 | 39,300 | 2021\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Czech Republic\u202f\\* | Europe | 49,025 | 2023 | 49,946 | 2022 | 40,700 | 2020\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Poland\u202f\\* | Europe | 45,538 | 2023 | 43,269 | 2022 | 34,900 | 2021\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Estonia\u202f\\* | Europe | 45,236 | 2023 | 46,697 | 2022 | 38,700 | 2021\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Saint Pierre and Miquelon\u202f\\* | Americas | \u2014 | \u2014 | 46,200 | 2006\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Portugal\u202f\\* | Europe | 45,227 | 2023 | 41,452 | 2022 | 33,700 | 2021\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Bahamas\u202f\\* | Americas | 44,950 | 2023 | 40,379 | 2022 | 30,200 | 2021\n |\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

It is also more diverse and can be divided into five geographic sub-regions. The Luxembourg plateau, in south-central Luxembourg, is a large, flat, sandstone formation, and the site of the city of Luxembourg. Little Switzerland, in the east of Luxembourg, has craggy terrain and thick forests. The Moselle valley is the lowest-lying region, running along the southeastern border. The Red Lands, in the far south and southwest, are Luxembourg's industrial heartland and home to many of Luxembourg's largest towns.\n\n\nThe border between Luxembourg and Germany is formed by three rivers: the Moselle, the Sauer, and the Our. Other major rivers are the Alzette, the Attert, the Clerve, and the Wiltz. The valleys of the mid-Sauer and Attert form the border between the Gutland and the Oesling.\n\n\n\n### Environment[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The Grand Ducal Palace in Luxembourg City, the official residence of the grand duke of Luxembourg\nLegislative power is vested in the Chamber of Deputies, a unicameral legislature of sixty members, who are directly elected to five-year terms from four constituencies.

There is also an Administrative Tribunal and an Administrative Court, as well as a Constitutional Court, all of which are located in the capital.\n\n\n\n### Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Cantons of Luxembourg and Communes of Luxembourg\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLuxembourg has participated in the Eurocorps, has contributed troops to the UNPROFOR and IFOR missions in former Yugoslavia, and has participated with a small contingent in the NATO SFOR mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Luxembourg troops have also deployed to Afghanistan, to support ISAF. The army has also participated in humanitarian relief missions such as setting up refugee camps for Kurds and providing emergency supplies to Albania.[106]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Luxembourg\n\nLuxembourg is one of Europe's smallest countries, ranking 168th in size of the 194 independent countries of the world; it is about 2,586 square kilometers (998\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) in size, measuring 82\u00a0km (51\u00a0mi) long and 57\u00a0km (35\u00a0mi) wide.

Additionally French was implemented as the only official language and Luxembourgish people were barred access to all civil services.[64] When the French Army introduced military duty for the local population, riots broke out which culminated in 1798 when Luxembourgish peasants started a rebellion.[64] Even though the French managed to rapidly suppress this revolt called *Kl\u00ebppelkrich*, it had a profound effect on the historical memory of the country and its citizens.[65]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Kreins, Jean-Marie (2003). *Histoire du Luxembourg* (in French) (3rd\u00a0ed.).

This consciousness of *Mir w\u00eblle bleiwe wat mir sinn* (\u201c*We want to remain what we are \u201d)* culminated in 1890, when the last step towards full independence was finally taken: due to a succession crisis the Dutch monarchy ceased to hold the title Grand-Duke of Luxembourg. Beginning with Adolph of Nassau-Weilburg, the Grand-Duchy would have their own monarchy, thus reaffirming its full independence.[79]\n\n\n\n### Two German occupations and interwar political crisis (1890\u20131945)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Frontier with Alsace-Lorraine from 1871 to 1918\nSee also: German occupation of Luxembourg during World War I and German occupation of Luxembourg during World War II\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nCoat of arms\n |\n| **Motto:**\"Mir w\u00eblle bleiwe wat mir sinn\" \"We want to remain what we are\" |\n| **Anthem:**\u00a0\"Ons Heemecht\"(\"Our Homeland\")**Royal anthem:**\u00a0\"De Wilhelmus\"a\n |\n| ![Location of\u00a0Luxembourg\u00a0(dark green) \u2013\u00a0in Europe\u00a0(green &\u00a0dark gray) \u2013\u00a0in the European Union\u00a0(green)](image)Location of\u00a0Luxembourg\u00a0(dark green)\u2013\u00a0in Europe\u00a0(green &\u00a0dark gray)\u2013\u00a0in the European Union\u00a0(green)\n |\n| Capitaland largest city\n | Luxembourg City[1]49\u00b048\u203252\u2033N 06\u00b007\u203254\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff49.81444\u00b0N 6.13167\u00b0E\ufeff / 49.81444; 6.13167 |\n| Official\u00a0languages | **National language:**Luxembourgish\n**Administrative languages:**LuxembourgishFrenchGerman |\n| Nationality (2023) | * 52.8% Luxembourgers\n* 14.5% Portuguese\n* 7.6% French\n* 3.7% Italians\n* 21.4% other\n |\n|  |\n| Religion (2018[2])\n | * + 73.2% Christianity\n\t\t- 63.8% Catholicism\n\t\t- 9.4% other Christian\n* 23.4% no religion\n* 3.2% other\n |\n| Demonym(s) | * Luxembourger\n* Luxembourgish\n |\n| Government | Unitary parliamentary constitutional monarchy |\n|  |\n| \u2022\u00a0Grand Duke\n | Henri |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAccording to the 2012 Environmental Performance Index, Luxembourg is one of the world's best performers in environmental protection, ranking 4th out of 132 assessed countries.[109] In 2020, it ranked second out of 180 countries.[110] Luxembourg also ranks 6th among the top ten most livable cities in the world by Mercer's.[111] The country wants to cut GHG emissions by 55% in 10 years and reach zero emissions by 2050.

By the end of the 13th century, the counts of Luxembourg reigned over a considerable territory.[27] In 1308, Count of Luxembourg Henry VII became King of the Romans and later Holy Roman Emperor;[28] the House of Luxembourg would produce four Holy Roman Emperors during the High Middle Ages. In 1354, Charles IV elevated the county to the Duchy of Luxembourg.[29] The duchy eventually became part of the Burgundian Circle and then one of the Seventeen Provinces of the Habsburg Netherlands.[30]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n8. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Human Development Report 2021/2022\" (PDF).

The Grand Duchy, with its powerful fortress, became an independent state under the personal possession of William I of the Netherlands with a Prussian garrison to guard the city against another invasion from France.[33][29] In 1839, following the turmoil of the Belgian Revolution, the purely French-speaking part of Luxembourg was ceded to Belgium and the Luxembourgish-speaking part (except the Arelerland, the area around Arlon) became what is the present state of Luxembourg.[34]\n\n\n\n### Before AD 963[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n191. **^** \"M\u00e9morial A, 1979, No. 29\" (PDF) (in French).

The road network has been significantly modernized in recent years with 165\u00a0km (103\u00a0mi)[134] of motorways connecting the capital to adjacent countries. The advent of the high-speed TGV link to Paris has led to renovation of the city's railway station and a new passenger terminal at Luxembourg Airport was opened in 2008.[135] Luxembourg City reintroduced trams in December 2017 and there are plans to open light-rail lines in adjacent areas within the next few years.[136]\n\n\nThere are 681 cars per 1000 persons in Luxembourg\u2014higher than most of other states, and surpassed by the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Iceland, and other small states like Principality of Monaco, San Marino, Liechtenstein, the British overseas territory of Gibraltar, and Brunei.[137]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAs determined by law since 1984, Luxembourg has only one national language, Luxembourgish.[13] It is considered the mother tongue or \"language of the heart\" for Luxembourgers and the language they generally use to speak or write to each other. Luxembourgish as well as the dialects in adjacent Germany belong to the Moselle Franconian subgroup of the main West Central German dialect group, which are largely mutually intelligible across the border, but Luxembourgish also has more than 5,000 words of French origin.[178][179] Knowledge of Luxembourgish is a criterion for naturalisation.[180]\n\n\nIn addition to Luxembourgish, French and German are used in administrative and judicial matters, making all three administrative languages of Luxembourg.[13] Per article 4 of the law promulgated in 1984, if a citizen asks a question in Luxembourgish, German or French, the administration must reply, as far as possible, in the language in which the question was asked.[13]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter Belgium became an independent country following the victorious Belgian Revolution of 1830\u20131831, it claimed the entire Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg as being part of Belgium, however, the Dutch King who was also Grand Duke of Luxembourg, as well as Prussia, did not want to lose their grip on the mighty fortress of Luxembourg and did not agree with the Belgian claims.[68] The dispute would be solved at the 1839 Treaty of London where the decision of the Third Partition of Luxembourg was taken. This time the territory was reduced by more than half, as the predominantly francophone western part of the country (but also the then Luxembourgish-speaking part of Arelerland) was transferred to the new state of Belgium, thereby giving Luxembourg its modern-day borders. The treaty of 1839 also established full independence of the remaining Germanic-speaking Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg.[69][70][71][72]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cuisine of Luxembourg\n\n![](image)*Judd mat Gaardebounen*, served with boiled potatoes and Diekirch beer\nLuxembourg cuisine reflects its position on the border between the Latin and Germanic worlds, being heavily influenced by the cuisines of neighboring France and Germany.

Ireland has a total area of 84,421\u00a0km2 (32,595\u00a0sq\u00a0mi),[1][2][112] of which the Republic of Ireland occupies 83 percent.[113] Ireland and Great Britain, together with many nearby smaller islands, are known collectively as the British Isles. As the term *British Isles* can be controversial in relation to Ireland, the alternate term *Britain and Ireland* is sometimes used as a neutral term for the islands.[114]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIreland| * *\u00c9ire*\u00a0(Irish)\n* **Airlann**\u00a0\u00a0(Ulster Scots)\n |\n| --- |\n| ![Satellite image of Ireland](image)Satellite image, October 2010\n |\n| ![](image)Location of\u00a0Ireland\u00a0(dark green)in Europe\u00a0(dark grey)\n |\n| Geography |\n| Location | Northwestern Europe |\n| Coordinates | 53\u00b026\u203258\u2033N 07\u00b030\u203211\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff53.44944\u00b0N 7.50306\u00b0W\ufeff / 53.44944; -7.50306 |\n| Adjacent to | Atlantic Ocean |\n| Area | 84,421\u00a0km2 (32,595\u00a0sq\u00a0mi)[1] |\n| Area rank | 20th[2] |\n| Coastline | 7,527\u00a0km (4677.1\u00a0mi)[3][4] |\n| Highest\u00a0elevation | 1,041\u00a0m (3415\u00a0ft) |\n| Highest\u00a0point | Carrauntoohil |\n| Administration |\n| **Republic of Ireland**\n |\n| Largest city | Dublin, pop. 1,458,154 Metropolitan Area (2022)[5] |\n| United Kingdom\n |\n| Country | Northern Ireland |\n| Largest city | Belfast, pop. 671,559 Metropolitan Area (2011)[6] |\n| Demographics |\n| Demonym | Irish |\n| Population | 7,052,314[7] (2022)[a][8] |\n| Population rank | 19th |\n| Pop. density | 82.2/km2 (212.9/sq\u00a0mi) |\n| Languages | * English\n* Irish\n* ISL\n* Ulster Scots\n* NISL\n* Shelta\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIreland's largest religious group is Christianity. The largest denomination is Roman Catholicism, representing over 73% of the island (and about 87% of the Republic of Ireland). Most of the rest of the population adhere to one of the various Protestant denominations (about 48% of Northern Ireland).[144] The largest is the Anglican Church of Ireland. The Muslim community is growing in Ireland, mostly through increased immigration, with a 50% increase in the republic between the 2006 and 2011 census.[145] The island has a small Jewish community. About 4% of the Republic's population and about 14% of the Northern Ireland population[144] describe themselves as of no religion. In a 2010 survey conducted on behalf of the Irish Times, 32% of respondents said they went to a religious service more than once per week.\n\n\n\n### Divisions and settlements[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Provinces of Ireland, Counties of Ireland, and City status in Ireland\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Common Agricultural Policy had in the past subsidised potentially destructive agricultural practices, for example by emphasising production without placing limits on indiscriminate use of fertilisers and pesticides; but reforms have gradually decoupled subsidies from production levels and introduced environmental and other requirements.[141] 32% of Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions are correlated to agriculture.[142] Forested areas typically consist of monoculture plantations of non-native species, which may result in habitats that are not suitable for supporting native species of invertebrates. Natural areas require fencing to prevent over-grazing by deer and sheep that roam over uncultivated areas. Grazing in this manner is one of the main factors preventing the natural regeneration of forests across many regions of the country.[143]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Irish people, Demographics of the Republic of Ireland, and Demography of Northern Ireland\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGeopolitically, the island of Ireland is divided between the Republic of Ireland (officially named Ireland), an independent state covering five-sixths of the island, and Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom. As of 2022, the population of the entire island is just over 7\u00a0million, with 5.1 million living in the Republic of Ireland and 1.9 million in Northern Ireland, ranking it the second-most populous island in Europe after Great Britain.[8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe geography of Ireland comprises relatively low-lying mountains surrounding a central plain, with several navigable rivers extending inland. Its lush vegetation is a product of its mild but changeable climate which is free of extremes in temperature. Much of Ireland was woodland until the end of the Middle Ages. Today, woodland makes up about 10% of the island, compared with a European average of over 33%,[12] with most of it being non-native conifer plantations.[13][14] The Irish climate is influenced by the Atlantic Ocean and thus very moderate,[15] and winters are milder than expected for such a northerly area, although summers are cooler than those in continental Europe. Rainfall and cloud cover are abundant.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Ethnic groups | * 90.0% White\n* 2.8% Asian\n* 1.2% Black\n* 0.3% Arab\n* 1.2% other (inc.

Native species include deciduous trees such as oak, ash, hazel, birch, alder, willow, aspen, rowan and hawthorn, as well as evergreen trees such Scots pine, yew, holly and strawberry trees.[135] Only about 10% of Ireland today is woodland;[12] most of this is non-native conifer plantations, and only 2% is native woodland.[13][14] The average woodland cover of European countries is over 33%.[12] In the Republic, about 389,356 hectares (3,893.56\u00a0km2) is owned by the state, mainly by the forestry service Coillte.[12] Remnants of native forest can be found scattered around the island, in particular in the Killarney National Park.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* 16th and 17th centuries: confiscation and redistribution of land in the Plantations of Ireland\n* 1845\u20131849: The Great Famine occasioned depopulation and mass emigration\n* 1846: Westminster's repeal of the Corn Laws disrupted Irish agriculture[234]\n\n\n### Major industries[edit]\n\n\n#### Tourism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tourist destinations in Ireland\n\n![](image)Inisheer (*Inis O\u00edrr*), Aran Islands\nThere are three World Heritage Sites on the island: the *Br\u00fa na B\u00f3inne* complex, Skellig Michael and the Giant's Causeway.[235] Several other places are on the tentative list, for example the Burren, the Ceide Fields[236] and Mount Stewart.[237]\n\n\nSome of the most visited sites in Ireland include Bunratty Castle, the Rock of Cashel, the Cliffs of Moher, Holy Cross Abbey and Blarney Castle.[238] Historically important monastic sites include Glendalough and Clonmacnoise, which are maintained as national monuments in the Republic of Ireland.[239]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nTraditionally, Ireland is subdivided into four provinces: Connacht (west), Leinster (east), Munster (south), and Ulster (north). In a system that developed between the 13th and 17th centuries,[146] Ireland has 32 traditional counties. Twenty-six of these counties are in the Republic of Ireland, and six are in Northern Ireland. The six counties that constitute Northern Ireland are all in the province of Ulster (which has nine counties in total). As such, *Ulster* is often used as a synonym for Northern Ireland, although the two are not coterminous. In the Republic of Ireland, counties form the basis of the system of local government. Counties Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway, Waterford and Tipperary have been broken up into smaller administrative areas. However, they are still treated as counties for cultural and some official purposes, for example, postal addresses and by the Ordnance Survey Ireland. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n122. **^** \"Ireland: North West Europe\". *EnergyFiles.com*.

In the west, around County Galway and County Donegal, is a medium to high grade metamorphic and igneous complex of Caledonide affinity, similar to the Scottish Highlands. Across southeast Ulster and extending southwest to Longford and south to Navan is a province of Ordovician and Silurian rocks, with similarities to the Southern Uplands province of Scotland. Further south, along the County Wexford coastline, is an area of granite intrusives into more Ordovician and Silurian rocks, like that found in Wales.[118][119]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nCounties in Northern Ireland are no longer used for local governmental purposes,[147] but, as in the Republic, their traditional boundaries are still used for informal purposes such as sports leagues and in cultural or tourism contexts.[148]\n\n\nCity status in Ireland is decided by legislative or royal charter. Dublin, with over one million residents in the Greater Dublin Area, is the largest city on the island. Belfast, with 579,726 residents, is the largest city in Northern Ireland. City status does not directly equate with population size. For example, Armagh, with 14,590 is the seat of the Church of Ireland and the Roman Catholic Primate of All Ireland and was re-granted city status by Queen Elizabeth II in 1994 (having lost that status in local government reforms of 1840). In the Republic of Ireland, Kilkenny, the seat of the Butler dynasty, while no longer a city for administrative purposes (since the 2001 Local Government Act), is entitled by law to continue to use the description.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA ring of coastal mountains surrounds low plains at the centre of the island. The highest of these is Carrauntoohil (Irish: *Corr\u00e1n Tuathail*) in County Kerry, which rises to 1,039\u00a0m (3,409\u00a0ft) above sea level.[115] The most arable land lies in the province of Leinster.[116] Western areas are mainly mountainous and rocky with green panoramic vistas. River Shannon, the island's longest river at 360.5\u00a0km (224\u00a0mi) long, rises in County Cavan in the north-west and flows through Limerick in the midwest.[115][117]\n\n\n\n### Geology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geology of Ireland\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Nolan, William. \"Geography of Ireland\".

However, agriculture drives current land use patterns in Ireland, limiting natural habitat preserves,[131] particularly for larger wild mammals with greater territorial needs. With no large apex predators in Ireland other than humans and dogs, such populations of animals as semi-wild deer that cannot be controlled by smaller predators, such as the fox, are controlled by annual culling.\n\n\nThere are no snakes in Ireland, and only one species of reptile (the common lizard) is native to the island. Extinct species include the Irish elk, the great auk, brown bear and the wolf.

The oath was abolished and in 1937 a new constitution was adopted.[88] This completed a process of gradual separation from the British Empire that governments had pursued since independence.

Some have been converted into hotels, such as Ashford Castle,[240] Castle Leslie[241] and Dromoland Castle.[242]\n\n\n\n#### Energy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Energy in Ireland\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Proportion of respondents who said they could speak Irish in the Ireland census in 2011 or the Northern Ireland census in 2011\nThe two official languages of the Republic of Ireland are Irish and English. Each language has produced noteworthy literature. Irish, though now only the language of a minority, was the vernacular of the Irish people for thousands of years and was possibly introduced during the Iron Age. It began to be written down after Christianisation in the 5th century and spread to Scotland and the Isle of Man, where it evolved into the Scottish Gaelic and Manx languages respectively.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMain articles: Economy of the Republic of Ireland and Economy of Northern Ireland\n\nSee also: International Financial Services Centre, Dublin\n\n![](image)A proportional representation of Ireland exports, 2019\n### Overview and GDP[edit]\n\n\nThe GDP of the Republic of Ireland as of 2021[update] was \u20ac423.5 billion (nominal),[225] and in Northern Ireland in 2021, it was \u00a352 billion (GVA Balanced).[226] The GDP per capita in the Republic of Ireland was \u20ac84,049.9 (nominal) as of 2021[update],[225] and in Northern Ireland 2021 was \u00a327,154 (GVA Balanced).[226] The Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom measure these numbers differently.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n117. **^** \"Landscape of the River\".

Gorse (*Ulex europaeus*), a wild furze, is commonly found growing in the uplands and ferns are plentiful in the more moist regions, especially in the western parts. It is home to hundreds of plant species, some of them unique to the island, and has been \"invaded\" by some grasses, such as *Spartina anglica*.[136]\n\n\nThe algal and seaweed flora is that of the cold-temperate variety. The total number of species is 574[137] The island has been invaded by some algae, some of which are now well established.[138]\n\n\nBecause of its mild climate, many species, including sub-tropical species such as palm trees, are grown in Ireland. Phytogeographically, Ireland belongs to the Atlantic European province of the Circumboreal Region within the Boreal Kingdom. The island can be subdivided into two ecoregions: the Celtic broadleaf forests and North Atlantic moist mixed forests.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t* Central Statistics Office, Ireland (23 June 2022). \"Census of Population 2022 \u2013 Preliminary Results\".

It is located about one degree of latitude (137 kilometres or 85 miles) north of the equator, off the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula, bordering the Strait of Malacca to the west, the Singapore Strait to the south, the South China Sea to the east, and the Straits of Johor to the north. The country's territory comprises one main island, 63 satellite islands and islets, and one outlying islet; the combined area of these has increased by approximately 25% since the country's independence as a result of extensive land reclamation projects. It has the second highest population density of any country in the world, although there are numerous green and recreational spaces as a result of urban planning. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMain article: Geography of Singapore\n\nSee also: Land reclamation in Singapore\n\n![Map showing Singapore island and the territories belonging to Singapore and its neighbours](image)An outline of Singapore and the surrounding islands and waterways\nSingapore consists of 63 islands, including the main island, Pulau Ujong.[276] There are two man-made connections to Johor, Malaysia: the Johor\u2013Singapore Causeway in the north and the Tuas Second Link in the west. Jurong Island, Pulau Tekong, Pulau Ubin and Sentosa are the largest of Singapore's smaller islands. The highest natural point is Bukit Timah Hill at 163.63\u00a0m (537\u00a0ft).[277] Under British rule, Christmas Island and the Cocos Islands were part of Singapore, and both were transferred to Australia in 1957.[278][279][280] Pedra Branca is the nation's easternmost point.[281]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* \"Singapore Infopedia\" from Singapore's National Library Board; numerous well-researched and well-documented essays on key events and important figures, as well as topics regarding culture, architecture, nature, etc.\n* Census of Population 2000 (PDF) (Report).

In 2010 Singapore imported almost 15 million tons of sand for its projects, the demand being such that Indonesia, Malaysia, and Vietnam have all restricted or barred the export of sand to Singapore in recent years. As a result, in 2016 Singapore switched to using polders for reclamation, in which an area is enclosed and then pumped dry.[285]\n\n\n\n### Nature[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Wildlife of Singapore\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Singapore\". *Encyclopaedia Britannica*.

While the country is a multi-party democracy with free elections, the government under the People's Action Party (PAP) wields significant control and dominance over politics and society. The PAP has governed the country continuously since full internal self-government was achieved in 1959, currently holding 79 out of 93 elected seats in Parliament. One of the five founding members of ASEAN, Singapore is also the headquarters of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Secretariat, the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council Secretariat, and is the host city of many international conferences and events. Singapore is also a member of the United Nations, the World Trade Organization, the East Asia Summit, the Non-Aligned Movement, and the Commonwealth of Nations.\n\n\n\n\n## Name and etymology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Names of Singapore\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSingapore has a road system covering 3,356 kilometres (2,085\u00a0mi), which includes 161 kilometres (100\u00a0mi) of expressways.[315][316] The Singapore Area Licensing Scheme, implemented in 1975, became the world's first congestion pricing scheme, and included other complementary measures such as stringent car ownership quotas and improvements in mass transit.[317][318] Upgraded in 1998 and renamed Electronic Road Pricing (ERP), the system introduced electronic toll collection, electronic detection, and video surveillance technology.[319] A satellite-based system was due to replace the physical gantries by 2020, but has been delayed until 2026 due to global shortages in the supply of semiconductors.[320] As Singapore is a small island with a high population density, the number of private cars on the road is restricted with a pre-set car population quota, to curb pollution and congestion. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n294. **^** \"Singapore National Environment Agency Weather Statistics\".

It lies between latitudes 24\u00b0 and 27\u00b0 N, and longitudes 50\u00b0 and 52\u00b0 E. Most of the country consists of a low, barren plain, covered with sand. To the southeast lies the Khor al\u00a0Adaid (\"Inland Sea\"), an area of rolling sand dunes surrounding an inlet of the Persian Gulf. There are mild winters and very hot, humid summers.\n\n\nThe highest point in Qatar is Qurayn Abu al Bawl at 103 metres (338\u00a0ft)[3] in the Jebel Dukhan to the west, a range of low limestone outcroppings running north-south from Zikrit through Umm Bab to the southern border. The Jebel Dukhan area also contains Qatar's main onshore oil deposits, while the natural gas fields lie offshore, to the northwest of the peninsula.\n\n\n\n### Biodiversity[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Wildlife of Qatar and Natural areas of Qatar\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Amiri Diwan (official government website).\n* Qatar. *The World Factbook*.

According to the UN, the nation's economic growth, measured by GDP, was the fastest in the world during this decade.[93][94] The basis of this growth lay in the exploitation of natural gas in the North Field during the 1990s. At the same time, the population of Qatar tripled between 2001 and 2011, mostly due to an influx of foreigners.[95]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nQatar's heavy industrial projects, all based in Umm Said, include a refinery with a 50,000 barrels (8,000 m3) per day capacity, a fertiliser plant for urea and ammonia, a steel plant, and a petrochemical plant. All these industries use gas for fuel. Most are joint ventures between European and Japanese firms and the state-owned QatarEnergy. The US is the major equipment supplier for Qatar's oil and gas industry, and US companies are playing a major role in North Field gas development.[239]\n\n\nAccording to the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research, carbon dioxide emissions per person average over 30 tonnes, one of the highest in the world.[240]\n\n\nIn 2008 Qatar launched its National Vision 2030 which highlights environmental development as one of the four main goals for Qatar over the next two decades. The National Vision pledges to develop sustainable alternatives to oil-based energy to preserve the local and global environment.[241]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Qatar Science & Technology Park (QSTP) was established by Qatar Foundation in March 2009 as an attempt to assist the country's transition towards a knowledge economy.[373][374] With a seed capital of $800 million and initially hosting 21 organizations,[374] the QSTP became Qatar's first free-trade zone.[375]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of Qatar-related topics\n* Outline of Qatar\n* Qatar Airways\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The possible English pronunciations include /\u02c8k\u028ct\u0251\u02d0r, \u02c8k\u00e6t\u0251\u02d0r, \u02c8k\u0251\u02d0t\u0251\u02d0r, -\u0259r, k\u0259\u02c8t\u0251\u02d0r, k\u00e6\u02c8t\u0251\u02d0r, k\u0251\u02d0\u02c8t\u0251\u02d0r/; respetively: *KUT-ar, KAT-, KAHT-, -\u2060\u0259r, k\u0259-TAR, kat-AR, kah-TAR*.[13]\n2. **^** (Arabic: \u062f\u0648\u0644\u0629 \u0642\u0637\u0631, romanized: *Dawlat Qa\u1e6dar*\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n199. **^** Peter Kovessy (27 October 2015). \"Qatar's Emir signs into law kafala changes (updated)\".

It is Europe's fourth-smallest country, with an area of just over 160 square kilometres (62 square miles) and a population of 38,749 (as of 2019[update]).[15] Divided into 11 municipalities, its capital is Vaduz, and its largest municipality is Schaan. It is also the smallest country to border two countries.[16]\n\n\nEconomically, Liechtenstein has one of the highest gross domestic products per person in the world when adjusted for purchasing power parity.[17] The country has a strong financial sector centred in Vaduz. It was once known as a billionaire tax haven, but is no longer on any official blacklists of uncooperative tax haven countries. An Alpine country, Liechtenstein is mountainous, making it a winter sport destination.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLiechtenstein is one of the world's two doubly landlocked countries[65] \u2013 countries wholly surrounded by other landlocked countries (the other is Uzbekistan). Liechtenstein is the sixth-smallest independent nation in the world by area.\n\n\nThe principality of Liechtenstein is divided into 11 communes called *Gemeinden* (singular *Gemeinde*). The *Gemeinden* mostly consist of only a single town or village. Five of them (Eschen, Gamprin, Mauren, Ruggell, and Schellenberg) fall within the electoral district *Unterland* (the lower county), and the remainder (Balzers, Planken, Schaan, Triesen, Triesenberg, and Vaduz) within *Oberland* (the upper county).\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nDespite its alpine location, the prevailing southerly winds temper Liechtenstein's climate. Its climate is continental, with cloudy and cold winters, with frequent rain and snowfall. Summers are cool to slightly warm, cloudy, and humid.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The Rhine: border between Liechtenstein and Switzerland (view towards the Swiss Alps)\nLiechtenstein is situated in the Upper Rhine valley of the European Alps and is bordered to the east by the Austrian state of Vorarlberg, to the south by the canton of Grisons (Switzerland) and to the west by the canton of St. Gallen (Switzerland). The Rhine forms the entire western border of Liechtenstein. Measured south to north the country is about 24\u00a0km (15\u00a0mi) long. Its highest point, Grauspitz, is 2,599\u00a0m (8,527\u00a0ft). Despite its Alpine location, prevailing southerly winds make the climate comparatively mild. In winter, the mountain slopes are well suited to winter sports.\n\n\nNew surveys using more accurate measurements of the country's borders in 2006 have set its area at 160\u00a0km2 (62\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), with borders of 77.9\u00a0km (48.4\u00a0mi).[63] Liechtenstein's borders are 1.9\u00a0km (1.2\u00a0mi) longer than previously thought.[64]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n9. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Basic Data Selection, (Select all countries, \"GDP, Per Capita GDP - US Dollars\", and 2020 to generate table), United Nations Statistics Division.

The Falknishorn, at 2,452 metres (8,045\u00a0ft) above sea level, is the fifth highest mountain in Liechtenstein and represents the southernmost point of the country. The Liechtenstein-Graub\u00fcnden-Vorarlberg border triangle is the Naafkopf (2,570\u00a0m (8,430\u00a0ft) above sea level).[68]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Rhine is the longest and largest body of water in Liechtenstein. With a length of approximately 27 kilometres (17\u00a0mi), it represents the natural border with Switzerland and is of great importance for Liechtenstein's water supply. Furthermore, the Rhine is an important recreational area for the population. At 10 kilometres (6\u00a0mi), the Samina is the second longest river in the Principality. The troubled river begins at Triesenberg and flows into the Ill in Austria (near Feldkirch).\n\n\nThe only naturally formed lake in Liechtenstein is the Gampriner Seelein, which was not formed until 1927 by a flooding of the Rhine with enormous erosion. In addition, there are other artificially created lakes, which are mainly used to generate electricity. One of them is the Steg Reservoir, the largest lake in Liechtenstein.\n\n\n\n### Mountains[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Bev\u00f6lkerungsstatistik 2017 Llv.li, p. 7\n2. **^** \"Central Intelligence Agency\". *The World Factbook*.

On 2 September 2009, Liechtenstein and Germany signed an agreement on cooperation and the exchange of information in tax matters. The text of the agreement followed the OECD model agreement and provides for an exchange of information on tax matters upon request as of the 2010 tax year. In addition, Liechtenstein regards Germany as an important partner in safeguarding its interests in European integration. At the cultural level, project sponsorship plays a particularly important role. For example, the Hilti Foundation financed the exhibition \"Egypt's Sunken Treasures\" in Berlin, and the state donated 20,000 euros following the fire at the Duchess Anna Amalia Library in Weimar.\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Liechtenstein\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn addition to the peaks of the Alpine chain,[69] which belong to the Limestone Alps, two inselbergs, Fl\u00e4scherberg (1,135\u00a0m or 3,724\u00a0ft above sea level) in the south and Eschnerberg (698\u00a0m or 2,290\u00a0ft) in the north, rise from the Rhine Valley and belong to the Helvetic cover or flysch zone of the Alps.[70] Eschnerberg represents an important settlement area in the Liechtenstein Unterland.\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of Liechtenstein\n\n![](image)Looking southward at Vaduz city centre\n![](image)Silver coin: 5 kronen of Liechtenstein, 1904, the front of the coin is a portrait of Johann II\nDespite its limited natural resources, Liechtenstein is one of the few countries in the world with more registered companies than citizens; it has developed a prosperous, highly industrialized free-enterprise economy and boasts a financial service sector as well as a living standard that compares favourably with those of the urban areas of Liechtenstein's much larger European neighbours.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Balzers Heliport\nThere are about 250 kilometres (155\u00a0mi) of paved roadway within Liechtenstein, with 90\u00a0km (56\u00a0mi) of marked bicycle paths.\n\n\nA 9.5\u00a0km (6\u00a0mi) railway connects Austria and Switzerland through Liechtenstein. The country's railways are administered by the Austrian Federal Railways as part of the route between Feldkirch, Austria, and Buchs, Switzerland. Liechtenstein is nominally within the Austrian Verkehrsverbund Vorarlberg tariff region.[93]\n\n\nThere are four railway stations in Liechtenstein, namely Schaan-Vaduz, Forst Hilti, Nendeln and Schaanwald, served by an irregularly stopping train service between Feldkirch and Buchs provided by Austrian Federal Railways.[94][95]\n\n\n\nSee also: Rail transport in Liechtenstein\n\nLiechtenstein Bus is a subsidiary of the Swiss Postbus system, but separately run, and connects to the Swiss bus network at Buchs and at Sargans.[96] Holders of a *Swiss Travel Pass* can travel for free on Liechtenstein\u2019s buses.[97]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLiechtenstein participates in a customs union with Switzerland and employs the Swiss franc as the national currency. The country imports about 85% of its energy. Liechtenstein has been a member of the European Economic Area (an organization serving as a bridge between the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) and the European Union) since May 1995.\n\n\nThe government is working to harmonize its economic policies with those of an integrated Europe. In 2008, the unemployment rate was 1.5%. Liechtenstein has only one hospital, the Liechtensteinisches Landesspital in Vaduz. As of 2014 the CIA World Factbook estimated the gross domestic product (GDP) on a purchasing power parity basis to be $4.978\u00a0billion. As of 2009 the estimate per capita was $139,100, the highest listed for the world.[65]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLiechtenstein is a member of the United Nations, the European Free Trade Association, and the Council of Europe. It is not a member of the European Union, but it participates in both the Schengen Area and the European Economic Area. It has a customs union and a monetary union with Switzerland.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Liechtenstein\n\n### Early history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Gutenberg Castle, Balzers, Liechtenstein\n![](image)Vaduz Castle, overlooking the capital, is home to the Prince of Liechtenstein.\n![](image)Johann I Joseph, Prince of Liechtenstein from 1805 to 1806 and 1814 to 1836, by Johann Baptist von Lampi the Elder.

The monarch retains extensive executive and legislative powers, and plays a strong active role in the day to day politics of the country, and over all three branches of government. Representative democracy and direct democracy coexist in that elected parliament enacts legislation, and also voters can propose and enact laws and constitutional amendments independently of the legislature.[45] However, as with laws passed by the legislature, these can be vetoed by the monarch. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* In 1985 the Swiss Army fired off shells during an exercise and mistakenly burned a patch of forest inside Liechtenstein. The incident was said to have been resolved \"over a case of white wine\".[108]\n* In March 2007, a 170-man Swiss infantry unit got lost during a training exercise and inadvertently crossed 1.5\u00a0km (0.9 miles) into Liechtenstein. The accidental invasion ended when the unit realized their mistake and turned back.[124] The Swiss Army later informed Liechtenstein of the incursion and offered official apologies,[125] to which an internal ministry spokesperson responded, \"No problem, these things happen.\"[126]\n* On 20 September 2017, Liechtenstein signed the United Nations Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.[127]\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Outline of Liechtenstein\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2005, it was revealed that Jewish slave labourers from the Strasshof concentration camp, provided by the SS, had worked on estates in Austria owned by Liechtenstein's Princely House.[34] But a later inquiry found the family not to have known about this.[35]\n\n\nCitizens of Liechtenstein were forbidden to enter Czechoslovakia during the Cold War. The diplomatic conflict revolving around the controversial postwar Bene\u0161 decrees resulted in Liechtenstein not having international relations with the Czech Republic or Slovakia. Diplomatic relations were established between Liechtenstein and the Czech Republic on 13 July 2009,[36][37][38] and with Slovakia on 9 December 2009.[39]\n\n\nOn 20 September 1990, Liechtenstein was admitted into the United Nations as 160th member state. As a member of the United Nations General Assembly, the microstate is one of the few not to play a prominent role in UN-specialized agencies.\n\n\n\n### Financial centre[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Since 1923, there has been no border control between Liechtenstein and Switzerland.\nThe government of Liechtenstein taxes personal income, business income and principal (wealth). The basic rate of personal income tax is 1.2%. When combined with the additional income tax imposed by the communes, the combined income tax rate is 17.82%.[71] An additional income tax of 4.3% is levied on all employees under the country's social security programme. This rate is higher for the self-employed, up to a maximum of 11%, making the maximum income tax rate about 29% in total. The basic tax rate on wealth is 0.06% per annum, and the combined total rate is 0.89%. The tax rate on corporate profits is 12.5%.[65]\n\n\nLiechtenstein's gift and estate taxes vary depending on the relationship the recipient has to the giver and the amount of the inheritance. The tax ranges between 0.5% and 0.75% for spouses and children and 18% to 27% for non-related recipients. The estate tax is progressive.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2013, Liechtenstein won for the first time a SolarSuperState Prize in the Solar category recognizing the achieved level of the usage of photovoltaics per population within the state territory.[52] The SolarSuperState Association justified this prize with the cumulative installed photovoltaic power of some 290 watts per capita at the end of 2012. This placed Liechtenstein second in the world after Germany. Also in 2014, the SolarSuperState Association awarded the second place SolarSuperState Prize in the Solar category to Liechtenstein.[53] In the years 2015 and 2016, Liechtenstein was honoured with the first place SolarSuperState Prize in the Solar category because it had the world's biggest cumulative installed photovoltaic power output per capita.[54][55]\n\n\n\n![](image)Maltese consulate in Schaan\n### Foreign relations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Foreign relations of Liechtenstein\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
