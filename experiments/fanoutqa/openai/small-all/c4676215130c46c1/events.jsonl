the United States surpassed the British Empire's output around 1916,[6] which in turn had surpassed the Qing dynasty in aggregate output decades earlier.[7][8] Since China's transition to a socialist market economy through controlled privatisation and deregulation,[9][10] the country has seen its ranking increase from ninth in 1978, to second in 2010; China's economic growth accelerated during this period and its share of global nominal GDP surged from 2% in 1980 to 18% in 2021.[8][1][11] Among others, India has also experienced an economic boom since the implementation of economic liberalisation in the early 1990s.[12]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n5. **^** Callen, Tim (28 March 2012). \"Gross Domestic Product: An Economy's All\". *Finance & Development*.

Nominal GDP does not take into account differences in the cost of living in different countries, and the results can vary greatly from one year to another based on fluctuations in the exchange rates of the country's currency.[3] Such fluctuations may change a country's ranking from one year to the next, even though they often make little or no difference in the standard of living of its population.[4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** \"World Economic Outlook Database, October 2023\". *IMF.org*.

Nominal GDP does not take into account differences in the cost of living in different countries, and the results can vary greatly from one year to another based on fluctuations in the exchange rates of the country's currency.[3] Such fluctuations may change a country's ranking from one year to the next, even though they often make little or no difference in the standard of living of its population.[4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t+ PPP per capita\n\t+ nominal\n\t+ nominal per capita\n* Oceania\n\t+ GDP\n |\n| Subnational divisions | * Albania\n* Argentina\n* Australia\n* Austria\n* Baltic States\n* Belarus\n* Belgium\n* Brazil\n* Bulgaria\n* Canada\n\t+ cities\n* Chile\n\t+ per capita\n* China\n\t+ per capita\n\t+ cities\n\t+ prefectures\n* Colombia\n* Croatia\n* Czech Republic\n* Egypt\n* Finland\n* France\n\t+ per capita\n* Georgia\n* Germany\n\t+ per capita\n\t+ cities\n* Greece\n* Hungary\n* India\n\t+ PPP\n\t+ per capita\n* Indonesia\n\t+ per capita\n\t+ cities\n\t+ regencies\n* Italy\n\t+ nominal per capita\n* Japan\n\t+ per capita\n* Kazakhstan\n* Kenya\n* Malaysia\n* Mexico\n\t+ per capita\n* Mongolia\n* Netherlands\n* Nigeria\n* Nepal\n* Norway\n* Pakistan\n* Peru\n* Philippines\n* Poland\n* Portugal\n* Romania\n* Russia\n\t+ per capita\n* Saudi Arabia\n* Serbia\n* Slovakia\n* South Africa\n\t+ per capita\n* South Korea\n* Spain\n* Sweden\n* Switzerland\n* Ukraine\n* United Kingdom\n\t+ per capita\n* United States\n\t+ counties\n\t+ cities\n* Taiwan\n* Tanzania\n* Thailand\n* Turkey\n* Vietnam\n* OECD\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nComparisons of national wealth are also frequently made on the basis of purchasing power parity (PPP), to adjust for differences in the cost of living in different countries. Other metrics, nominal GDP per capita and a corresponding GDP (PPP) per capita are used for comparing national standard of living.

Nominal GDP does not take into account differences in the cost of living in different countries, and the results can vary greatly from one year to another based on fluctuations in the exchange rates of the country's currency.[3] Such fluctuations may change a country's ranking from one year to the next, even though they often make little or no difference in the standard of living of its population.[4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t+ PPP per capita\n\t+ nominal\n\t+ nominal per capita\n* Oceania\n\t+ GDP\n |\n| Subnational divisions | * Albania\n* Argentina\n* Australia\n* Austria\n* Baltic States\n* Belarus\n* Belgium\n* Brazil\n* Bulgaria\n* Canada\n\t+ cities\n* Chile\n\t+ per capita\n* China\n\t+ per capita\n\t+ cities\n\t+ prefectures\n* Colombia\n* Croatia\n* Czech Republic\n* Egypt\n* Finland\n* France\n\t+ per capita\n* Georgia\n* Germany\n\t+ per capita\n\t+ cities\n* Greece\n* Hungary\n* India\n\t+ PPP\n\t+ per capita\n* Indonesia\n\t+ per capita\n\t+ cities\n\t+ regencies\n* Italy\n\t+ nominal per capita\n* Japan\n\t+ per capita\n* Kazakhstan\n* Kenya\n* Malaysia\n* Mexico\n\t+ per capita\n* Mongolia\n* Netherlands\n* Nigeria\n* Nepal\n* Norway\n* Pakistan\n* Peru\n* Philippines\n* Poland\n* Portugal\n* Romania\n* Russia\n\t+ per capita\n* Saudi Arabia\n* Serbia\n* Slovakia\n* South Africa\n\t+ per capita\n* South Korea\n* Spain\n* Sweden\n* Switzerland\n* Ukraine\n* United Kingdom\n\t+ per capita\n* United States\n\t+ counties\n\t+ cities\n* Taiwan\n* Tanzania\n* Thailand\n* Turkey\n* Vietnam\n* OECD\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nComparisons of national wealth are also frequently made on the basis of purchasing power parity (PPP), to adjust for differences in the cost of living in different countries. Other metrics, nominal GDP per capita and a corresponding GDP (PPP) per capita are used for comparing national standard of living. On the whole, PPP per capita figures are less spread than nominal GDP per capita figures.[5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| ![](image) Kenya | Africa | 112,749 | 2023 | 113,420 | 2022 | 110,347 |

Nominal GDP does not take into account differences in the cost of living in different countries, and the results can vary greatly from one year to another based on fluctuations in the exchange rates of the country's currency.[3] Such fluctuations may change a country's ranking from one year to the next, even though they often make little or no difference in the standard of living of its population.[4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nComparisons of national wealth are also frequently made on the basis of purchasing power parity (PPP), to adjust for differences in the cost of living in different countries. Other metrics, nominal GDP per capita and a corresponding GDP (PPP) per capita are used for comparing national standard of living. On the whole, PPP per capita figures are less spread than nominal GDP per capita figures.[5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t+ PPP per capita\n\t+ nominal\n\t+ nominal per capita\n* Oceania\n\t+ GDP\n

Upon the nomination of the premier, the NPC convenes to confirm the nomination, but since only one name is on the ballot, it can only approve or reject. To date, it has never rejected a personnel nomination.[18] Since the premier, the head of government in China, is the most important political appointment in the Chinese government, the nomination power, under some circumstances, may give the president real political influence.[19]\n\n\nThe director of the Office of the President of the PRC (Chinese: 中华人民共和国主席办公室; pinyin: *Zhōnghuá Rénmín Gònghéguó Zhǔxí Bàngōngshì*) is Cai Qi, who is also the director of the CCP General Office and the director of the CCP General Secretary Office.[20]\n\n\n\n## Political ranking[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Orders of precedence in China\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | 11 years, 91 days (Incumbent)\n | Incumbent\n | Living\n | 25,93170 years, 364 days (Living)\n |\n\n\n## Spouse of the president[edit]\n\n\nSince the first president, six presidents have had a spouse during their term in office.

In 1993, Jiang Zemin, who had been general secretary of the CCP and chairman of the Central Military Commission since 1989, assumed the presidency as well, becoming the undisputed top leader of the party and the state.[6][7] Jiang stepped down as president in 2003, handing the post to then–Vice President Hu Jintao, the first vice president to assume the office. Hu had already become general secretary in 2002. In turn, Hu vacated both offices for Xi Jinping in 2012 and 2013, who had also previously served as vice president under Hu.[8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAccording to the Organic Law of the National People's Congress (NPC), constitutionally China's highest organ of state power, the president is nominated by the NPC Presidium, the Congress's executive organ.[12][*non-primary source needed*] However, the nomination is effectively made by the Chinese Communist Party, with the decisions being made among Party leaders.[13] Although the Presidium could theoretically nominate multiple candidates for the presidency, leading the election to be competitive, it has always nominated a single candidate for the office.[13]\n\n\nAfter the nomination, the president is elected by the NPC, which also has the power to remove the president and other state officers from office. Elections and removals are decided by majority vote.[11][*non-primary source needed*] The length of the president's term of office is the same as the NPC, which is 5 years.[11] Since 2018, the president is required to recite the constitutional oath of office before assuming office.[13]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe president also conducts state visits on behalf of the People's Republic.[note 2] Under the constitution, the \"state visit\" clause is the only presidential power that does not stipulate any form of oversight from the NPC. As the vast majority of presidential powers are dependent on the ratification of the NPC, the president is, in essence, a symbolic post without any direct say in the governance of state. It is therefore conceived to mainly function as a symbolic institution of the state rather than an office with true executive powers.[15][16][17]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nPolitics of the People's Republic of China\n |\n| --- |\n| * Constitution\n* Laws\n* Ideology\n |\n| Communist Party | * Central Committee\n\t+ Politburo\n\t\t- Standing Committee\n\t\t\t* General Secretary\n\t\t- Secretariat\n\t+ Military Commission\n* Central Commission for Discipline Inspection\n\t+ Secretary\n* Provincial standing committees\n* Constitution\n | ![National emblem of the People's Republic of China](image)\n |\n| Centralgovernment | * Paramount leader\n* National People's Congress\n\t+ Standing Committee\n\t\t- Chairman\n* President\n\t+ Vice President\n* State Council\n\t+ Premier\n\t+ Vice-Premiers\n\t+ State Councilors\n\t+ Ministries\n* Central Military Commission\n\t+ Chairman\n\t+ People's Liberation Army\n\t+ People's Armed Police\n\t+ Militia\n* National Supervisory Commission\n* Supreme People's Court\n* Supreme People's Procuratorate\n |\n| United front | * Political Consultative Conference\n\t+ Chairperson\n\t+ Minor parties\n\t+ People's organization\n* United Front Work Department\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe constitution also mandated term limits for the office, stipulating the president and vice president could not serve more than two consecutive terms.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe posts of the premier, president and CCP general secretary were held by different individuals in the 1980s. That said, in reality political power was concentrated on Deng Xiaoping, effectively the paramount leader, who controlled the Party, government and the military from \"behind the scenes\" without holding any of the three posts. However, presidents Li Xiannian (1983–1988) and Yang Shangkun (1988–1993) were not simple figureheads, but actually significant players in the highest leadership.

In addition, the president names and dismisses ambassadors to foreign countries, and signs and annuls treaties with foreign entities. According to the Constitution, all of these powers require the approval or confirmation of the National People's Congress (NPC),[11][*non-primary source needed*] which the office is subject to.[14]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe first state representative of the People's Republic of China was the chairman of the Central People's Government, which was established on 1 October 1949 by a decision of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. It was replaced in Constitution in 1954 with the office of state chairman. It was successively held by Mao Zedong and Liu Shaoqi. Liu fell into political disgrace during the Cultural Revolution, after which the presidency became vacant. The post of chairman was abolished under the Constitution of 1975, and the function of state representative was bestowed on the chairman of the NPC Standing Committee. The office was reinstated in the Constitution of 1982 but with reduced powers. Since 1982, the title's official English-language translation has been \"president\", although the Chinese title remains unchanged.[note 1]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_wQzYGKrV7yO0a9PG4DpqxPeG","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

Nominal GDP does not take into account differences in the cost of living in different countries, and the results can vary greatly from one year to another based on fluctuations in the exchange rates of the country's currency.[3] Such fluctuations may change a country's ranking from one year to the next, even though they often make little or no difference in the standard of living of its population.[4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** \"World Economic Outlook Database, October 2023\". *IMF.org*.

Other metrics, nominal GDP per capita and a corresponding GDP (PPP) per capita are used for comparing national standard of living. On the whole, PPP per capita figures are less spread than nominal GDP per capita figures.[5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n9. **^** Kau, Michael Ying-mao (30 September 1993). *China in the Era of Deng Xiaoping: A Decade of Reform*.

The prime minister chairs the Cabinet of Japan and has the ability to select and dismiss its ministers of state. The prime minister also serves as the commander-in-chief of the Japan Self Defence Forces[2] and is a sitting member of either house of the National Diet (typically the House of Representatives). The individual is appointed by the emperor of Japan after being nominated by the National Diet (the parliament). The prime minister must retain the confidence of the House of Representatives to remain in office.\n\n\nThe prime minister lives and works at the Prime Minister's Official Residence in Nagatacho, Chiyoda, Tokyo, close to the National Diet Building. Fumio Kishida is the current prime minister of Japan, replacing Yoshihide Suga on 4 October 2021.[3] As of 14 June 2024, there have been 64 individual prime ministers serving 101 terms of office.\n\n\n\n\n## Designation[edit]\n\n\n### Abbreviations[edit]\n\n\nIn Japanese, due to the special nature of the work of the head of government, the prime minister's titles vary depending on context, sometimes demonstrating his/her role. Since the inception of the cabinet system, the prime minister is known in Japanese as *Naikaku Sōri-Daijin* (内閣総理大臣) whenever he is referred to as the head of the Cabinet. However, this title is usually abbreviated to *Sōri-Daijin* (総理大臣). Other abbreviations include *Sōri* (総理), *Shushō* (首相) or even *Saishō* (宰相).[4]\n\n\n\n### English notation[edit]\n\n\nThe official English rendering is 'Prime Minister'.[5] This English translation was informally used as the English translation of 'Grand Minister' before the introduction of the cabinet system. However, this was not the original English translation of 'Prime Minister', and a German translation, 'Minister President of the State', was also used in the past.\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Itō Hirobumi, the first Prime Minister of Japan\nBefore the adoption of the Meiji Constitution, Japan had in practice no written constitution. Originally, a Chinese-inspired legal system known as *ritsuryō* was enacted in the late Asuka period and early Nara period. It described a government based on an elaborate and rational meritocratic bureaucracy, serving, in theory, under the ultimate authority of the emperor; although in practice, real power was often held elsewhere, such as in the hands of the Fujiwara clan, who intermarried with the imperial family in the Heian period, or by the ruling *shōgun*. Theoretically, the last *ritsuryō* code, the Yōrō Code enacted in 752, was still in force at the time of the Meiji Restoration.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nUnder this system, the *Daijō-daijin* (太政大臣, Chancellor of the Realm)[6] was the head of the *Daijō-kan* (Department of State), the highest organ of Japan's pre-modern Imperial government during the Heian period and until briefly under the Meiji Constitution with the appointment of Sanjō Sanetomi in 1871. The office was replaced in 1885 with the appointment of Itō Hirobumi to the new position of Minister President of State,[7] four years before the enactment of the Meiji Constitution, which mentions neither the Cabinet nor the position of Prime Minister explicitly.[8][9] It took its current form with the adoption of the Constitution of Japan in 1947.\n\n\nTo date, 64 people have served this position. The longest serving prime minister to date is Shinzo Abe, who served as prime minister in two terms: from 26 September 2006 until 26 September 2007, and from 26 December 2012 until 16 September 2020.[10]\n\n\n\n## Appointment[edit]\n\n\nThe prime minister is nominated by both houses of the Diet, before the conduct of any other business. For that purpose, each conducts a ballot under the run-off system. If the two houses choose different individuals, then a joint committee of both houses is appointed to agree on a common nominee. Ultimately, however, if the two houses do not agree within ten days, the decision of the House of Representatives is deemed to be that of the Diet. Therefore, the House of Representatives can theoretically ensure the appointment of any prime minister it wants.[11] The nominee is then presented with his or her commission, and formally appointed to office by the emperor.[12]\n\n\nConventionally, the prime minister is almost always the leader of the majority party in the House of Representatives, or the leader of the senior partner in the governing coalition. But there have been three cabinet prime ministers from junior coalition partners (Ashida 1948, Hosokawa 1993, Murayama 1994), a few minority governments (most recently the Hata Cabinet in 1994 and at least numerically the Second Hashimoto Cabinet of 1996 during its first year, but with an extra-cabinet cooperation (閣外協力, *kakugai kyōryoku*) agreement with two parties, sufficient to ensure safe majorities for most government initiatives), and several cabinets with a majority in the House of Representatives, but without legislative majority of their own (most recently the DPJ-led cabinets after the 2010 election; cf. *Nejire Kokkai*/\"twisted Diets\").[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Qualifications[edit]\n\n\n* Must be a member of either house of the Diet. (This implies a minimum age of 25 and a Japanese nationality requirement.)[13]\n* Must be a civilian. This excludes serving members of the Japan Self-Defense Forces. Former military persons may be appointed, with Yasuhiro Nakasone being one prominent example.[13]\n\n\n## Role[edit]\n\n\n### Constitutional roles[edit]\n\n\n* Exercises \"control and supervision\" over the entire executive branch.[14]\n* Presents bills to the Diet on behalf of the Cabinet.[15]\n* Signs laws and Cabinet orders (along with other members of the Cabinet).[16]\n* Appoints all Cabinet ministers, and can dismiss them at any time.[17]\n* May permit legal action to be taken against Cabinet ministers.[18]\n* Must make reports on domestic and foreign relations to the Diet.[15]\n* Must report to the Diet upon demand to provide answers or explanations.[19]\n* May advise the emperor to dissolve the Diet's House of Representatives.[20]\n\n\n### Statutory roles[edit]\n\n\n* Presides over meetings of the Cabinet.[21]\n* Commander-in-chief of the Japan Self-Defense Forces.[22]\n* May override a court injunction against an administrative act upon showing of cause.[23]\n\n\nUnlike most of his counterparts in constitutional monarchies, the prime minister is both *de jure* and *de facto* chief executive. In most other constitutional monarchies, the monarch is nominal chief executive, while being bound by convention to act on the advice of the cabinet. In contrast, the Constitution of Japan explicitly vests executive power in the Cabinet, of which the prime minister is the leader. His countersignature is required for all laws and Cabinet orders. While most ministers in parliamentary democracies have some freedom of action within the bounds of cabinet collective responsibility, the Japanese Cabinet is effectively an extension of the prime minister's authority.\n\n\n\n## Insignia[edit]\n\n\n* ![Standard of the Prime Minister](image)\n\nStandard of the Prime Minister\n* ![Seal of the Prime Minister](image)\n\nSeal of the Prime Minister\n* ![Mon (crest) of the Prime Minister](image)\n\nMon (crest) of the Prime Minister\n\n\n## Official office and residence[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kantei, the Prime Minister's Official Residence\nLocated near the Diet building, the Office of the Prime Minister of Japan is called the *Kantei* (官邸). The original Kantei served from 1929 until 2002, when a new building was inaugurated to serve as the current Kantei.[24] The old Kantei was then converted into the Official Residence, or *Kōtei* (公邸).[25] The Kōtei lies to the southwest of the Kantei, and is linked by a walkway.[25]\n\n\n\n## Travel[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Japanese Air Force One\n\nSee also: Prime Minister's Official Car (Japan)\n\nThe prime minister of Japan travels in a Toyota Century, which replaced the Lexus LS 600h L in 2019.\n\n\nFor overseas air travel, the Japanese government maintains two Boeing 777, which replaced the Boeing 747-400 also in 2019. The aircraft is also used by the emperor, the members of the imperial family, and other high-ranking officials.\n\n\nThey have the radio callsigns Japanese Air Force One and Japanese Air Force Two when operating on official business, and Cygnus One and Cygnus Two when operating outside of official business (e.g., on training flights). The aircraft always fly together on government missions, with one serving as the primary transport and the other serving as a backup with maintenance personnel on board. The aircraft are officially referred to as Japanese government exclusive aircraft (日本国政府専用機, *Nippon-koku seifu sen'yōki*).[26]\n\n\n\n* ![Toyota Century](image)\n\nToyota Century\n* ![Japanese Air Force One](image)\n\nJapanese Air Force One\n\n\n## Honours and emoluments[edit]\n\n\nUntil the mid-1930s, the prime minister of Japan was normally granted a hereditary peerage (*kazoku*) prior to leaving office if he had not already been ennobled. Titles were usually bestowed in the ranks of count, viscount or baron, depending on the relative accomplishments and status of the prime minister. The two highest ranks, marquess and prince, were only bestowed upon highly distinguished statesmen, and were not granted to a prime minister after 1928. The last prime minister who was a peer was Baron Kijūrō Shidehara, who served as Prime Minister from October 1945 to May 1946. The peerage was abolished when the Constitution of Japan came into effect in May 1947.\n\n\nCertain eminent prime ministers have been awarded the Order of the Chrysanthemum, typically in the degree of Grand Cordon. The highest honour in the Japanese honours system, the Collar of the Order of the Chrysanthemum, has only been conferred upon select prime ministers and eminent statesmen; the last such award to a living prime minister was to Saionji Kinmochi in 1928. More often, the Order of the Chrysanthemum has been a posthumous distinction; both the Collar and Grand Cordon of the order were last awarded posthumously to former prime minister Shinzo Abe in July 2022.[27]\n\n\nAfter relinquishing office, the prime minister is normally accorded the second or senior third rank in the court order of precedence, and is usually raised to the senior second rank posthumously. Certain distinguished prime ministers have been posthumously raised to the first rank; the last such award was to Eisaku Sato in 1975. Since the 1920s, following their tenure in office, Prime ministers have typically been conferred with the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Paulownia Flowers (until 2003 a special higher class of the Order of the Rising Sun), depending on tenure and eminence. However, honours may be withheld due to misconduct or refusal on the part of the prime minister (for example, Kiichi Miyazawa).\n\n\nThe Prime Minister also awards individuals in recognition of their accomplishments in sport, entertainment, and other fields. Some of the awards and commendations offered include the Prime Minister's Award, created by Eisaku Satō in 1966, and the People's Honour Award, created by Takeo Fukuda in 1977. Additionally, the PM also presents the Prime Minister's Trophy on behalf of the Japan Professional Sports Association and the Monodzukuri Nippon award on behalf of the Japanese Manufacturing Association.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of prime ministers of Japan\n* List of spouses of prime ministers of Japan\n* Air transports of heads of state and government\n* Official state car\n* Japanese Air Force One\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The Cabinet shall resign en masse after a general election of members of the House of Representatives. Their term of office is four years which can be terminated earlier. No limits are imposed on the number of terms or tenures the Prime Minister may hold. The Prime Minister is, by convention, the leader of the victorious party, though some prime ministers have been elected from junior coalition partners or minority parties.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** *首相は4049万円、閣僚の給料は安い？高い？ 菅内閣誕生ドキュメント* (in Japanese), The Nikkei, 16 September 2020, retrieved 20 May 2022\n2. **^** \"Book review: A nuanced deep dive on Japan's Self-Defense Forces\".\n3. **^** \"Fumio Kishida: Japan's new prime minister takes office\". *BBC News*. 4 October 2021.
