Beginning in the early 20th century, many justices who left the Court voluntarily did so by retiring from the Court without leaving the federal judiciary altogether. A retired justice, according to the United States Code, is no longer a member of the Supreme Court, but remains eligible to serve by designation as a judge of a U.S. Court of Appeals or District Court, and many retired justices have served in these capacities. Historically, the average length of service on the Court has been less than 15 years. However, since 1970 the average length of service has increased to about 26 years.[8]\n\n\n\n## List of justices[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nSupreme Court of the United States\n |\n| --- |\n| The court | * Lists of cases\n* Court demographics\n* Ideological leanings\n* Nomination and confirmation\n | ![](image)\n |\n| Procedures | * *Amicus curiae* brief\n* *Certiorari*\n\t+ Cert. before judgment\n\t+ Cert. dismissed as improvidently granted\n\t+ Grant, vacate, remand\n* Shadow docket\n\t+ In-chambers opinion\n |\n| Current members | * **Chief justice:** John Roberts\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | ![](image) | Harlan F.

W. Bush nominated Thomas to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to fill the seat vacated by Robert Bork.[103][104] Thomas gained the support of other African American officials, including former transportation secretary William Coleman, and said that when meeting white Democratic staffers in the United States Senate, he was \"struck by how easy it had become for sanctimonious whites to accuse a black man of not caring about civil rights\".[65]\n\n\nIn February 1990, the Senate Judiciary Committee recommended Thomas by a vote of 12 to 1. On March 6, 1990, the Senate confirmed him to the Court of Appeals by a vote of 98 to 2.[102] He developed cordial relationships during his 19 months on the federal court, including with Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg.[65] During his judgeship, Thomas authored 19 opinions.[105]\n\n\n\n## Nomination to the Supreme Court[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Clarence Thomas Supreme Court nomination\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n203. **^** Casey, Nicholas (May 18, 2020). \"Passed By for Decades, Clarence Thomas Is a New Symbol of the Trump Era\". *The New York Times*.

They have three adult children: Chloe, an Episcopal priest; Nell; and Michael.[20]\n\n\n\n## Legal career[edit]\n\n\nAfter law school, Breyer served as a law clerk to U.S. Supreme Court justice Arthur Goldberg from 1964 to 1965. He served briefly as a fact-checker for the Warren Commission, then spent two years in the U.S. Department of Justice's Antitrust Division as a special assistant to its Assistant Attorney General.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBreyer was born on August 15, 1938, in San Francisco, California,[9] to Anne A. (*n\u00e9e* Roberts) and Irving Gerald Breyer.[10] Breyer's paternal great-grandfather emigrated from Romania to the United States, settling in Cleveland, Ohio, where Breyer's grandfather was born.[11] Breyer was raised in a middle-class Jewish family. His father was a lawyer who served as legal counsel to the San Francisco Board of Education.[12] Breyer and his younger brother Charles R. Breyer, who later became a federal district judge, were active in the Boy Scouts of America and achieved the Eagle Scout rank.[13][14] Breyer attended Lowell High School, where he was a member of the Lowell Forensic Society and debated regularly in high school tournaments, including against future California governor Jerry Brown and future Harvard Law School professor Laurence Tribe.[15]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n64. **^** Cillizza, Chris (August 27, 2021). \"Analysis: Stephen Breyer just made Democrats' Friday\".

But after heavy lobbying by Senators Ted Kennedy and Tom Harkin, Clinton met with Breyer again and proceeded to nominate him as an associate justice of the United States Supreme Court on May 17, 1994.[32] Breyer was confirmed by the Senate on July 29, 1994, by an 87 to 9 vote, and received his commission on August 3.\n\n\nIn 2015, Breyer broke a federal law that bans judges from hearing cases when they or their spouses or minor children have a financial interest in a company involved. His wife sold about $33,000 worth of stock in Johnson Controls a day after Breyer participated in the oral argument. This brought him back into compliance and he joined the majority in ruling in favor of the interests of a Johnson Controls subsidiary which was party to *FERC v. Electric Power Supply Ass'n*.[33]\n\n\nBreyer wrote 551 opinions during his 28-year career, not counting those relating to orders or in the \"shadow docket\".[34]\n\n\n\n### Abortion[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n3. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Smentkowski, Brian P.

He held other prominent positions before being nominated to the Supreme Court, including special assistant to the United States Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust and assistant special prosecutor on the Watergate Special Prosecution Force in 1973. Breyer became a federal judge in 1980, when he was appointed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. In his 2005 book *Active Liberty*, Breyer made his first attempt to systematically communicate his views on legal theory, arguing that the judiciary should seek to resolve issues in a manner that encourages popular participation in governmental decisions.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2000, Breyer wrote the majority opinion in *Stenberg v. Carhart*, which struck down a Nebraska law banning partial-birth abortion.[35][36] On June 29, 2020, he wrote the plurality opinion in *June Medical Services v. Russo*.[37] The ruling struck down Louisiana's abortion law requiring any doctor who performed abortions to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles. Breyer reaffirmed the \"benefits and burdens\" test he had created in *Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt*, which struck down a nearly identical abortion law in Texas. In 2022, he dissented in *Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization*, which overturned *Roe v. Wade*.\n\n\n\n### Census[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* WGBH Forum Network: one and a half hours with US Supreme Court Justice of Law Stephen Breyer, September 8, 2003.

Katz*.[70] He retired on June 30, 2022, at 12:00 noon EDT, following the court's final opinions and orders for the term.[71][72] Breyer's retirement left only one military veteran, Samuel Alito, on the Supreme Court.[73]\n\n\n\n## Judicial philosophy[edit]\n\n\n### In general[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Purposive approach\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn *Department of Commerce v. New York* (2019), Breyer was in the 5\u20134 majority that ruled that the Census Bureau had not followed proper procedure in its implementation of a citizenship question. He was also one of four justices who would have held the citizenship question unconstitutional in itself. In a mostly concurring opinion, he wrote: \"Yet the decision was ill considered in a number of critically important respects. The Secretary did not give adequate consideration to issues that should have been central to his judgment, such as the high likelihood of an undercount, the low likelihood that a question would yield more accurate citizenship data, and the apparent lack of any need for more accurate citizenship data to begin with. The Secretary's failures in considering those critical issues make his decision unreasonable\".[38]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nJudicial opinions of Stephen Breyer\n |\n| --- |\n| U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit (1980\u20131994); *by calendar year*\n |\n| * 1980\n* 1981\n* 1982\n* 1983\n* 1984\n* 1985\n* 1986\n* 1987\n* 1988\n* 1989\n* 1990\n* 1991\n* 1992\n* 1993\n* 1994\n |\n| Supreme Court of the United States (August 3, 1994 \u2013 June 30, 2022); *by term*\n |\n| * 1994\n* 1995\n* 1996\n* 1997\n* 1998\n* 1999\n* 2000\n* 2001\n* 2002\n* 2003\n* 2004\n* 2005\n* 2006\n* 2007\n* 2008\n* 2009\n* 2010\n* 2011\n* 2012\n* 2013\n* 2014\n* 2015\n* 2016\n* 2017\n* 2018\n* 2019\n* 2020\n* 2021\n |\n\n| Authority control databases ![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\n |\n| --- |\n| International | * FAST\n* ISNI\n* VIAF\n* WorldCat\n |\n| National | * Norway\n* Spain\n* France\n* BnF data\n* Catalonia\n* Germany\n* Italy\n* Israel\n* Belgium\n* United States\n* Latvia\n* Japan\n* Czech Republic\n* Australia\n* Korea\n* Croatia\n* Netherlands\n\t+ 2\n |\n| Academics | * CiNii\n |\n| People | * Trove\n |\n| Other | * NARA\n* SNAC\n* IdRef\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter graduating from high school in 1955, Breyer studied philosophy at Stanford University. He graduated in 1959 with a Bachelor of Arts degree with highest honors and membership in Phi Beta Kappa.[16] Breyer was awarded a Marshall Scholarship, which he used to study philosophy, politics, and economics at Magdalen College, Oxford, receiving a first-class honors B.A. in 1961.[17] He then returned to the United States to attend Harvard Law School, where he was an articles editor of the *Harvard Law Review* and graduated in 1964 with a Bachelor of Laws degree, *magna cum laude*.[18]\n\n\nBreyer spent eight years in the United States Army Reserve including six months on active duty in the Army Strategic Intelligence. He reached the rank of corporal and was honorably discharged in 1965.[19]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAfter Democratic victories in the 2020 presidential and Senate elections, progressive activists and Democratic members of Congress called on Breyer to retire so that President Biden could nominate a younger liberal justice.[62][63] In an August 2021 *New York Times* interview, Breyer said he wished to retire before his death, and recounted a conversation he had with Justice Antonin Scalia in which Scalia mentioned that he did not want his successor to \"reverse everything I've done for the last 25 years\". Breyer said that Scalia's point will \"inevitably be in the psychology\" of his decision to retire.[64] In a September 2021 interview with *Fox News'*s Chris Wallace, Breyer said activists calling for his retirement are \"entitled to their opinion\" and \"I didn't retire because I had decided on balance I wouldn't retire\". He said he took several factors into account when deciding his retirement plans, and reiterated that he did not plan to \"die on the court\".[65]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Collins, Ronald (February 28, 2014). \"Hypothetically Speaking: Justice Breyer's Dialectical Propensities\". *Concurring Opinions Blog*.\n\n## External links[edit]\n\n\n**Stephen Breyer** at Wikipedia's sister projects\n\n* ![](image)Media from Commons\n* ![](image)Quotations from Wikiquote\n* ![](image)Texts from Wikisource\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn December 18, 2020, Breyer was one of three dissenters in *Trump v. New York*. In a 20-page dissent, he argued that the Court should not have sidestepped the case and should have ruled in favor of the challengers, who wanted the Court to block the Trump administration's last-minute attempts to exclude undocumented immigrants from the census.[39] The census ultimately did not exclude undocumented immigrants, due to a lack of time and the subsequent issuance of Executive Order 13986.\n\n\n\n### Copyright[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBreyer's pragmatic approach to the law \"will tend to make the law more sensible\", according to Cass Sunstein, who added that Breyer's \"attack on originalism is powerful and convincing\".[74]\n\n\nBreyer consistently voted in favor of abortion rights,[75][36] one of the most controversial areas of the Supreme Court's docket. He also defended the Court's use of foreign law and international law as persuasive (but not binding) authority in its decisions.[76][77][78] Breyer is also recognized as deferential to the interests of law enforcement and to legislative judgments in the Court's First Amendment rulings. He demonstrated a consistent pattern of deference to Congress, voting to overturn congressional legislation at a lower rate than any other Justice since 1994.[79]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n> I think it's very, very, very important\u2014very important\u2014for us to show up at that State of the Union, because people today are more and more visual. What [people] see in front of them at the State of the Union is that federal government. And I would like them to see the judges too, because federal judges are also a part of that government.[96]\n> \n> \n\n\n### Honors[edit]\n\n\nBreyer was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 2004.[97] In 2007, Breyer was honored with the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award by the Boy Scouts of America.[98] In 2018, he was named to chair of the Pritzker Architecture Prize jury, succeeding previous chair Glenn Murcutt.[99]\n\n\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\n\nBreyer has appeared as a guest on Stephen Colbert's TV show. On the *Late Show* in September 2021, he discussed the Texas Heartbeat Act and his reluctance to retire.[100][101]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n75. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Wittes, Benjamin (September 25, 2005). \"Memo to John Roberts: Stephen Breyer, a cautious, liberal Supreme Court justice, explains his view of the law\". *The Washington Post*.

A 5\u20134 majority ruled that Section 4(b) of the Voting Rights Act is unconstitutional. Breyer joined another dissent by Ginsburg in *RNC v. DNC*, which overturned a lower court's extension of a voting deadline in the Wisconsin primary elections.[59] The lower court had extended the deadline so that people who had not yet received mail-in ballots by April 7 could vote by mail in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Breyer dissented in a similar Wisconsin case in October; the petitioners had asked the court to require Wisconsin to count mail-in ballots received up to six days after Election Day, and the Court, with Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan dissenting, refused the petitioners' request to extend the deadline.[60] Breyer joined Kagan's dissent in *Brnovich v. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn April 28, 2004, Breyer dissented in *Vieth v. Jubelirer*, in which the Court held that partisan gerrymandering is a non-justiciable claim. Breyer wrote in his dissent, \"Sometimes purely political 'gerrymandering' will fail to advance any plausible democratic objective while simultaneously threatening serious democratic harm. And sometimes when that is so, courts can identify an equal protection violation and provide a remedy.\"[56] In 2006, Breyer was in a 5\u20134 majority holding that District 23 of the 2003 Texas redistricting violated the Voting Rights Act due to vote dilution. Along with Justice John Paul Stevens, Breyer would also have ruled in favor of plaintiffs' claims that Texas's statewide plan was an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander. In June 2019, Breyer dissented in *Rucho v. Common Cause*, in which the Supreme Court decided 5\u20134 that gerrymandering is a non-justiciable claim.[57]\n\n\n\n### Voting rights[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Bush nominated Roberts to a seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to replace judge James L. Buckley, who had recently retired.[35] However, the Democratic Party had a majority in the Senate at the time and was in conflict with Bush over his judicial nominees. Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Patrick Leahy refused to give Roberts a hearing in the 107th Congress.[36] The GOP regained control of the Senate on January 7, 2003, and Bush resubmitted Roberts's nomination that day. Roberts was confirmed on May 8, 2003,[37] and received his commission on June 2, 2003.[38] During his two-year tenure on the D.C. Circuit, Roberts authored 49 opinions, eliciting two dissents from other judges, and authoring three dissents of his own.[13]\n\n\n\n### Fourth and Fifth amendments[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRoberts grew up in Northwest Indiana and was educated in a series of Catholic schools. He studied history at Harvard University and then attended Harvard Law School, where he was managing editor of the *Harvard Law Review*. He served as a law clerk for Circuit Judge Henry Friendly and Justice William Rehnquist before taking a position in the attorney general's office during the Reagan Administration. He went on to serve the Reagan Administration and the George H. W. Bush Administration in the Department of Justice and the Office of the White House Counsel, during which he was nominated by George H. W. Bush to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, but no vote on his nomination was held.[10] Roberts then spent 14 years in private law practice. During this time, he argued 39 cases before the Supreme Court.[11] Notably, he represented 19 states in *United States v. Microsoft Corp.*[12]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRoberts wrote a dissent in *Rancho Viejo, LLC v. Norton*,[45] a case involving the protection of a rare California toad under the Endangered Species Act. When the court denied a rehearing en banc,(D.C. Cir. 2003)[45] Roberts dissented, arguing that the panel opinion was inconsistent with *United States v. Lopez* and *United States v. Morrison* in that it incorrectly focused on whether the *regulation* substantially affects interstate commerce rather than on whether the regulated *activity* does. In Roberts's view, the Commerce Clause of the Constitution did not permit the government to regulate activity affecting what he called \"a hapless toad\" that \"for reasons of its own, lives its entire life in California.\" He said that reviewing the panel decision would allow the court \"alternative grounds for sustaining application of the Act that may be more consistent with Supreme Court precedent.\"[46]\n\n\n\n## Appointment to Supreme Court[edit]\n\n\nMain article: John Roberts Supreme Court nomination\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)President George W. Bush announces Roberts's nomination to be Chief Justice (2005).\nOn July 19, 2005, President Bush nominated Roberts to the U.S. Supreme Court to fill a vacancy to be created by the impending retirement of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. Roberts's nomination was the first Supreme Court nomination since Stephen Breyer in 1994.\n\n\nOn September 3, 2005, while Roberts's confirmation was pending before the Senate, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist died. Two days later, Bush withdrew Roberts's nomination as O'Connor's successor and announced Roberts's new nomination as Chief Justice.[47]\n\n\n\n### Roberts's testimony on his jurisprudence[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n### Confirmation[edit]\n\n\nOn September 22, the Senate Judiciary Committee approved Roberts's nomination by a vote of 13\u20135, with Senators Ted Kennedy, Richard Durbin, Charles Schumer, Joe Biden and Dianne Feinstein voting against. Roberts was confirmed by the full Senate on September 29 by a margin of 78\u201322.[58] All Republicans and the one Independent voted for Roberts; the Democrats split evenly, 22\u201322. Roberts was confirmed by what was, historically, a narrow margin for a Supreme Court justice.[59] However, all subsequent confirmation votes have been even more narrow.[60][61][62][63]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Supreme Court[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Roberts Court\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRoberts became a federal judge in 2003, when President George W. Bush appointed him to the District of Columbia Circuit. During his two-year tenure on the D.C. Circuit, Roberts authored 49 opinions, eliciting two dissents from other judges, and authoring three dissents of his own.[13] In 2005, Bush nominated Roberts to the Supreme Court, initially to be an associate justice to fill the vacancy left by the retirement of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. Chief Justice William Rehnquist died shortly afterward, however, before Roberts's Senate confirmation hearings had begun. Bush then withdrew Roberts's nomination and instead nominated him to become Chief Justice, choosing Samuel Alito to replace O'Connor.\n\n\nRoberts has authored the majority opinion in many important cases, including decisions relating to elections, federal agencies, presidential power, the Affordable Care Act, and race-based college admissions.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n78. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Rosen, Jeffrey. \"Jeffrey Rosen: Big Chief \u2013 The New Republic\". *The New Republic*.

Alito Sr., an Italian immigrant from Roccella Ionica, Calabria, and Rose Fradusco, an Italian-American whose parents came from Palazzo San Gervasio in Basilicata.[1][2][3] Alito's father earned a master's degree at Rutgers University and was a high school teacher and later the first director of the New Jersey Office of Legislative Services, a state government position he held from 1952 to 1984. Alito's mother was a schoolteacher. Both are deceased.[4]\n\n\nAlito grew up in Hamilton Township, New Jersey, a suburb of Trenton.[5] He attended Steinert High School, where he graduated in 1968 as the class valedictorian,[6] subsequently matriculating at Princeton University. In 1972, he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts, *summa cum laude*, from the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs.[7] His senior thesis, supervised by political scientist Walter F. Murphy, was entitled \"An Introduction to the Italian Constitutional Court\".[8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Samuel Alito, 2018\nIn 2003, Congress passed the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, which led to a lawsuit in the case of *Gonzales v. Carhart*. The Court had previously ruled in *Stenberg v. Carhart* that a state's ban on partial birth abortion was unconstitutional because such a ban did not have an exception in the case of a threat to the health of the mother. The membership of the Court changed after *Stenberg*, with Roberts and Alito replacing Rehnquist (a dissenter in *Roe*) and O'Connor (a supporter of *Roe*) respectively. Further, the ban at issue in *Gonzales v. Carhart* was a federal statute, rather than a state statute as in the *Stenberg* case.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter an FBI agent was shot in the line of duty in 1988, Alito personally handled the trial, assigning himself the then-novice Stuart Rabner as an assistant, and securing the shooter's conviction.[28] In March 1988, Alito sought a rehearing of extradition proceedings against two Indian men, represented by Ron Kuby, who were accused of being terrorist assassins, after Alito discovered that the death threats his prosecutor had received had been sent to her by herself.[29] The prosecutor was later found not guilty of obstruction of justice by reason of insanity, after psychiatrists found she may have suffered from schizophrenia, with up to four distinct personalities.[28][30] In 1989, Alito prosecuted a member of the Japanese Red Army for planning a terrorist bombing in Manhattan.[31]\n\n\nAlito is a member of the Federalist Society, a group of conservative and libertarian lawyers and legal students interested in conservative legal theory.[32]\n\n\n\n## Court of Appeals judge[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAlito was raised in Hamilton Township, New Jersey, and was educated at Princeton University and Yale Law School. After graduating from law school, he worked as an assistant attorney general for the Office of Legal Counsel and served as the U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey. In 1990, Alito was appointed as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, where he served until joining the Supreme Court. He has called himself a \"practical originalist\" and has been described as one of the Court's \"most conservative justices\".\n\n\nAlito wrote the majority opinion in *Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization* (2022), in which the Supreme Court overturned its 1973 abortion rights decision *Roe v. Wade*. He has also written majority opinions in the landmark cases *McDonald v. Chicago*, *Burwell v. Hobby Lobby*, *Murphy v. NCAA*, and *Janus v. AFSCME*.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Gibson, James L. and Gregory A.

Ceballos*, *Hudson v. Michigan* and *Kansas v. Marsh*), Alito created a 5\u20134 majority by voting with the four other conservative Justices\u00a0\u2013 Chief Justice John G. Roberts and Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy, and Clarence Thomas. He further voted with the conservative wing of the court on *Sanchez-Llamas v. Oregon*[55] and *Rapanos v. United States*. Alito also dissented in *Hamdan v. Rumsfeld* alongside Justices Scalia and Thomas.\n\n\nAlito delivered the Supreme Court Historical Society's 2008 Annual Lecture, \"The Origin of the Baseball Antitrust Exemption\". The lecture was published in two journals.[56][57]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Alito ceremonially sworn in by Chief Justice John Roberts the day after his confirmation, February 1, 2006.\nDebate on the nomination began in the full Senate on January 25. After a failed filibuster attempt by Senator John Kerry, the Senate confirmed Alito to the Supreme Court on January 31 by a vote of 58\u201342.[47] All Senate Republicans voted in favor of confirmation except Lincoln Chafee, and all Senate Democrats voted against confirmation except Tim Johnson, Robert Byrd, Kent Conrad, and Ben Nelson. An Independent, Jim Jeffords, voted against confirmation.[48][49] Alito was sworn in as an associate justice of the Supreme Court later that day.[50][51] He became the 110th justice, the second Italian-American,[52][53] the 11th Catholic in the history of the Supreme Court, and the fifth Catholic on the Court at the time he assumed office.[54]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs an adjunct professor at Seton Hall University School of Law in Newark from 1999 to 2004, Alito taught courses in constitutional law and an original course on terrorism and civil liberties. In 1995, he received the school's Saint Thomas More Medal \"in recognition of his outstanding contributions to the field of law\".[95] On May 25, 2007, he delivered the commencement address at Seton Hall Law's commencement ceremony and received an honorary law degree from the school.[96]\n\n\nAs a visiting professor at Duke University School of Law, Alito taught Current Issues in Constitutional Interpretation in fall 2011 and a course in the Master of Laws in Judicial Studies program in summer 2012.[97][*better\u00a0source\u00a0needed*]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn January 24, his nomination was voted out of the Senate Judiciary Committee on a 10\u20138 party line vote. Democratic Senators characterized Alito as a hard-right conservative in the mold of Clarence Thomas or Robert Bork. Alito professed reluctance to commit to any type of ideology, stating he would act as an impartial referee. He said he would look at abortion with an open mind but would not state how he would rule on *Roe v. Wade* if that decision were to be challenged. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n9. **^** Report of the Chairman \u2212 Samuel Alito Archived November 26, 2020, at the Wayback Machine, Conference on the Boundaries of Privacy in American Society, Woodrow Wilson Sch. of Pub. & Int'l Affairs, Princeton Univ. at 5 (January 4, 1972).\n10. **^** \"The Princetonian\".

Garth, for whom Alito clerked, and Maryanne Trump Barry, under whom Alito worked as an assistant U.S. Attorney, recommended Alito's judicial nomination to President George H. W. Bush.[19] On February 20, 1990, Bush nominated Alito to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, to a seat vacated by John Joseph Gibbons. The American Bar Association rated Alito \"Well Qualified\" at the time of his nomination. He was confirmed by unanimous consent in the Senate on April 27, 1990,[33][34] and received his commission three days later. As a Third Circuit judge, his chambers were in Newark, New Jersey.[15]\n\n\n\n### Notable opinions[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAlito's confirmation hearing was held from January 9 to 13, 2006. Two active-duty members of the Third Circuit, Judge Maryanne Trump Barry and Chief Judge Anthony J. Scirica, testified in Alito's confirmation hearing, as did five senior and retired circuit judges.[40] Alito responded to some 700 questions over 18 hours of testimony. He rejected the use of foreign legal materials in the Constitution, did not state a position on cameras in courtrooms (he had supported them while on the 3rd Circuit), said Congress could choose to outlaw LGBT employment discrimination in the United States if it wished, and told then-Senator Joe Biden (D-DE) that he endorsed a weak version of the unitary executive theory.[41]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Her nomination was confirmed by the Senate in August 2009 by a vote of 68\u201331. While on the Court, Sotomayor has supported the informal liberal bloc of justices when they divide along the commonly perceived ideological lines. During her Supreme Court tenure, Sotomayor has been identified with concern for the rights of defendants and criminal justice reform, and is known for her impassioned dissents on issues of race, ethnic, and gender identity, including in *Schuette v.
