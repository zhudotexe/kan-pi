The City of Parker is the only city that still operates under a special act, and has a weak mayor-council form of government. All three cities not of the third class, along with 22 third class cities, have adopted home rule charters, which give the cities broader powers to manage their affairs. When a city adopts a home rule charter, it does not lose its status as a city nor its classification.[2]\n\n\nTwo cities have adopted optional plans under the same law. From 1957 to 1972, third class cities were able to adopt optional charters, of which 10 remain in effect. Cities that operate under home rule charters, optional plans, or optional charters are also found in the List of Pennsylvania municipalities and counties with home rule charters, optional charters, or optional plans.\n\n\nHome rule municipalities that are styled as cities but not classified as cities are not included below.\n\n\n\n\n## Cities gallery[edit]\n\n\n* ![Philadelphia, the largest city in

The legislative branch, the Allentown City Council, includes seven council members elected at large for four-year staggered terms.[83] City Council holds regular public meetings in order to enact city legislation, including ordinances and resolutions.

Allentown is corporate headquarters for several large companies, including Air Products,[66] PPL Corporation, and others.[67] The largest employer in Allentown, as of 2007, is Lehigh Valley Health Network with over 7,800 employees.[68] Lehigh Valley Health Network's flagship hospital, Lehigh Valley Hospital–Cedar Crest, is Pennsylvania's third-largest hospital with 877 licensed beds and 46 operating rooms.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCenter City Allentown, along Hamilton Street between 5th and 10th Streets, was the primary shopping district in Allentown for most of the 20th century.

Two years later, in 1843, Northampton Bank failed as a result of the bank's excessive speculation, resulting in financial ruin for many bank customers. Five years later, on June 1, 1848, a large fire burned down most of Allentown's central business district between 7th and 8th Streets on Hamilton Street. During the 1850s, however, the city began recovering. A new bridge was built across the Lehigh River, and brick buildings were constructed to replace wooden ones that were burned in the 1848 fire.
