With Swann's help, Bond tracks Spectre to Morocco and learns that Spectre is behind the terror attacks, creating a need for Nine Eyes. Spectre controls Nine Eyes, giving them access to the intelligence-sharing network. Oberhauser captures and tortures Bond, revealing that his father was Bond's guardian after the deaths of Bond's parents. Jealous of the attention and care that his father gave to the young James Bond, Oberhauser faked his own death while at the same time murdering his own father. Now known as Ernst Stavro Blofeld, he claims responsibility for everything Bond has suffered in his career. Bond and Swann escape and return to London where Bond joins forces with Mallory and Q to shut down Nine Eyes and apprehend Blofeld.[47][48][49]\n\n\n\n### *No Time to Die* (2021)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *No Time to Die*\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Film\n | Awards\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Eon films\n |\n| *Dr. No* | Winner, Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year – Actress at the 21st Golden Globe Awards[111] |\n| *From Russia with Love* | Winner, BAFTA Award for British Cinematography: Colour at the 17th British Academy Film Awards[112]Nominated, Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song at the 22nd Golden Globe Awards[113] |\n| *Goldfinger* | Winner, Academy Award for Best Sound Effects at the 37th Academy Awards[114]Nominated, BAFTA Award for Best British Art Direction: Colour at the 18th British Academy Film Awards[115] |\n| *Thunderball* | Winner, Academy Award for Best Visual Effects at the 38th Academy Awards[116]Nominated, BAFTA Award for Best British Art Direction: Colour at the 19th British Academy Film Awards[117] |\n| *You Only Live Twice* | Nominated, BAFTA Award for Best British Art Direction: Colour at the 21st British Academy Film Awards[118] |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | 25% (40 reviews)[106] | 48 (11 reviews)[107] |  |\n| *Never Say Never Again* | 70% (53 reviews)[108] | 68 (15 reviews)[109] |  |\n\n\n## Awards[edit]\n\n\nIn their sixty-year history, the Bond films have been nominated for and won many awards, including British Academy Film Awards, Golden Globe Awards and Academy Awards.
