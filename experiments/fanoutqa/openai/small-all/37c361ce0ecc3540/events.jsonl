The exact land area is sometimes challenged by border disputes, most notably about Taiwan, Aksai Chin, the Trans-Karakoram Tract, and South Tibet. The area of the People's Republic of China is 9,596,960 km2 (3,705,410 sq mi) according to the CIA's *The World Factbook*.[1] The People's Republic of China is either the third or fourth-largest country in the world, being either slightly larger or slightly smaller than the United States, depending on how the area of the United States is measured.

The climate of the country is difficult to describe because it varies so much depending on the region of China. The southernmost parts of the country are almost tropical, while the northernmost part is subarctic.[13]\n\n*Click any region for more info.

In general, the land is high in the west and descends to the east coast. Mountains (33 percent), plateaus (26 percent) and hills (10 percent) account for nearly 70 percent of the country's land surface.

About 1.3% (some 116,580 km²) is planted to permanent crops and the rest planted to temporary crops. With comparatively little land planted to permanent crops, intensive agricultural techniques are used to reap harvests that are sufficient to feed the world's largest population and still have surplus for export. An estimated 544,784 km² of land were irrigated in 2004. 42.9% of total land area was used as pasture, and 17.5% was forest.\n\n\n\n### Wildlife[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Wildlife of China\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n16. **^** \"China sends ship to disputed sea\". *BBC News*. 16 June 2011.

In the western sector, China claimed portions of the 41,000 km2 (16,000 sq mi) Pamir Mountains area, a region of soaring mountain peaks and glacier-filled valleys where the borders of Afghanistan, Pakistan, the former Soviet Union, and China meet in Central Asia. North and east of this region, some sections of the border remained undemarcated in 1987. The 6,542 kilometres (4,065 mi) frontier with the Soviet Union has been a source of continual friction. In 1954 China published maps showing substantial portions of Soviet Siberian territory as its own. In the northeast, border friction with the Soviet Union produced a tense situation in remote regions of Inner Mongolia and Heilongjiang along segments of the Argun River, Amur River, and Ussuri River. Each side had massed troops and had exchanged charges of border provocation in this area. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nGeographical features of China\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* History of human geography in China\n* Environment of China\n* List of islands of China\n* List of rivers in China\n* List of mountains in China\n* Lakes in China\n* North China Plain\n* Geography of Hong Kong\n* Geography of Macau\n* Geographic information systems in China\n* Zomia (geography)\n\n## Notes and references[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n9. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"East Asia/Southeast Asia :: China — The World Factbook - Central Intelligence Agency\". *www.cia.gov*.

To the southeast Canada shares a maritime boundary with France's overseas collectivity of Saint Pierre and Miquelon, the last vestige of New France.[2] By total area (including its waters), Canada is the second-largest country in the world, after Russia. By land area alone, however, Canada ranks fourth, the difference being due to it having the world's largest proportion of fresh water lakes.[3] Of Canada's thirteen provinces and territories, only two are landlocked (Alberta and Saskatchewan) while the other eleven all directly border one of three oceans.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nLawrence Lowlands, the Appalachian region, the Western Cordillera, Hudson Bay Lowlands and the Arctic Archipelago.[9] Canada is also divided into fifteen terrestrial and five marine ecozones,[10] encompassing over 80,000 classified species of life.[11] Since the end of the last glacial period, Canada has consisted of eight distinct forest regions, including extensive boreal forest on the Canadian Shield;[12] 42 percent of the land acreage of Canada is covered by forests (approximately 8 percent of the world's forested land), made up mostly of spruce, poplar and pine.[13] Canada has over 2,000,000 lakes—563 greater than 100 km2 (39 sq mi)—which is more than any other country, containing much of the world's fresh water.[14][15] There are also freshwater glaciers in the Canadian Rockies, the Coast Mountains and the Arctic Cordillera.[16] A recent global remote sensing analysis also suggested that there were 6,477 km2 of tidal flats in Canada, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![Labelled map of Canada detailing its provinces and territories](image)A political map of Canada showing its 10 provinces and 3 territories\nCanada is divided into ten provinces and three territories.

Boreal forests prevail throughout the country, ice is prominent in northerly Arctic regions and through the Canadian Rocky Mountains, and the relatively flat Canadian Prairies in the southwest facilitate productive agriculture.[21] The Great Lakes feed the St. Lawrence River (in the southeast) where lowlands host much of Canada's population.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOver half of Canada's landscape is intact and relatively free of human development.[58] Approximately half of Canada is covered by forest, totaling around 2.4 million km2 (0.93 million sq mi).[59] The boreal forest of Canada is considered to be the largest intact forest on earth, with around 300,000 square kilometres (120,000 sq mi) undisturbed by roads, cities or industry.[60] The Canadian Arctic tundra is the second-largest vegetation region in the country consisting of dwarf shrubs, sedges and grasses, mosses and lichens.[61]\n\n\nApproximately 12.1 percent of the nation's landmass and freshwater are conservation areas, including 11.4 percent designated as protected areas.[18] Approximately 13.8 percent of its territorial waters are conserved, including 8.9 percent designated as protected areas.[18]\n\n\n\n## Palaeogeography[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Volcanism of Canada and Geology of Canada\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Rivers of Canada\nCanada holds vast reserves of water: its rivers discharge nearly 7% of the world's renewable water supply,[66] Canada has over 2,000,000 lakes—563 greater than 100 square kilometres (39 sq mi)—which is more than any other country and has the third largest amount of glacier water.[67] Canada is also home to about twenty five percent (134.6 million ha) of the world's wetlands that support a vast array of local ecosystems.[68]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![Canadian Provinces and Territories](image)\n |\n| Continent | North America |\n| Region | Northern America |\n| Coordinates | 60°00′N 95°00′W﻿ / ﻿60.000°N 95.000°W﻿ / 60.000; -95.000 |\n| Area | Ranked 2nd |\n|  • Total | 9,984,671 km2 (3,855,103 sq mi) |\n|  • Land | 91.08% |\n|  • Water | 8.92% |\n| Coastline | 243,042 km (151,019 mi) |\n| Borders | 8,893 km |\n| Highest point | Mount Logan, 5,959 m (19,551 ft) |\n| Lowest point | Atlantic Ocean, Sea Level |\n| Longest river | Mackenzie River, 4,241 km (2,635 mi) |\n| Largest lake | Great Bear Lake 31,153 km2 (12,028 sq mi) |\n| Climate | temperate, or humid continental to subarctic or arctic in north, and tundra in mountainous areas, and the far north |\n| Terrain | mostly plains and mountains in west, to highlands (low mountains) in the south east, and east, to flatlands in the Great lakes |\n| Natural resources | iron ore, nickel, zinc, copper, gold, lead, molybdenum, potash, diamonds, silver, fish, timber, wildlife, coal, petroleum, natural gas, hydropower |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n75. **^** Canada, Government of Canada, Statistics (15 January 2001). \"Population, urban and rural, by province and territory (Canada)\". *www.statcan.gc.ca*.

This makes it the sixth-largest country in the world by area of jurisdiction, which comprises 7,686,850 km2 (2,967,910 sq mi) (including Lord Howe Island and Macquarie Island), which is slightly smaller than the 48 states of the contiguous United States and 31.5 times larger than that of the United Kingdom.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Australian mainland has a total coastline length of 35,821 km (22,258 mi) with an additional 23,860 km (14,830 mi) of island coastlines.[1] There are 758 estuaries around the country with most located in the tropical and sub-tropical zones.[2] A recent global remote sensing analysis suggested that there was 8,866 km2 (3,423 sq mi) of tidal flat area in Australia, making it the third-ranked country in terms of how much tidal flat occurs there.[3] Australia has the third-largest exclusive economic zone of 8,148,250 km2 (3,146,060 sq mi). This EEZ does not include the Australian Antarctic Territory (an additional 5,896,500 km2 (2,276,700 sq mi)).\n\n\nAustralia has the largest area of ocean jurisdiction of any country on Earth.[4] It has no land borders.
