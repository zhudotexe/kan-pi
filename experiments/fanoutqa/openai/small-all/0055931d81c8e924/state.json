It was published in the United States the following year by Scholastic Corporation under the title ***Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone***. It won most of the British book awards that were judged by children and other awards in the US. The book reached the top of the *New York Times* list of best-selling fiction in August 1999 and stayed near the top of that list for much of 1999 and 2000. It has been translated into at least 73 other languages and has been made into a feature-length film of the same name, as have all six of its sequels. The novel has sold in excess of 120 million copies, making it the fourth best-selling book of all time.[1][2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n74. **^** Schmitz, Greg Dean. \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (2001)\".

Barry Cunningham, who was building a portfolio of distinctive fantasies by new authors for Bloomsbury Children's Books, recommended accepting the book[14] and the eight-year-old daughter of Bloomsbury's chief executive said it was \"so much better than anything else\".[15]\n\n\n\n### Publication and reception in the United Kingdom[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn June 1997, Bloomsbury published *Philosopher's Stone* with an initial print run of 500 copies in hardback, three hundred of which were distributed to libraries.[17] Her original name, \"Joanne Rowling\", can be found on the copyright page of all British editions until September 1999. (The 1998 first American edition would remove reference to \"Joanne\" completely.)[18] The short initial print run was standard for first novels and Cunningham hoped booksellers would read the book and recommend it to customers.[14] Examples from this initial print run have sold for as much as US$471,000 in a 2021 Heritage auction.[19] Thomas Taylor created the cover for the first edition.[14]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* ![](image) Quotations related to *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone* at Wikiquote\n* Background information and storylines from the Harry Potter Lexicon\n* *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone* title listing at the Internet Speculative Fiction Database\n* Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone at Open Library ![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n*Harry Potter* by J.

Much like with other novels in the series, *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets* triggered religious debates; some religious authorities have condemned its use of magical themes, whereas others have praised its emphasis on self-sacrifice and the way one's character is the result of one's choices.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n36. **^** Rowling, J.K.

In fact, *Half-Blood Prince* was the working title of *Chamber of Secrets* and Rowling says she originally intended to present some \"crucial pieces of information\" in the second book, but ultimately felt \"this information's proper home was book six\".[38] Some objects that play significant roles in *Half-Blood Prince* first appear in *Chamber of Secrets*: the Hand of Glory and the opal necklace that are on sale in Borgin and Burkes; a Vanishing Cabinet in Hogwarts that is damaged by Peeves the Poltergeist; and Tom Riddle's diary, which is later revealed to be a Horcrux.[39] Additionally, these two novels are the ones with the most focus on Harry's relationship with Ginny Weasley.\n\n\n\n## Adaptations[edit]\n\n\n### Film[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nJ.K Rowling found it difficult to finish *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets* because she was afraid it would not live up to the expectations raised by *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*. After delivering the manuscript to Bloomsbury on schedule, she took it back for six weeks of revision.[1]\n\n\nIn early drafts of the book, the ghost Nearly Headless Nick sang a self-composed song explaining his condition and the circumstances of his unknown death. This was cut because the book's editor did not care for the poem, which has been subsequently published as an extra on J. K. Rowling's official website.[2] The family background of Dean Thomas was removed because Rowling and her publishers considered it an \"unnecessary digression,\" and she considered Neville Longbottom's own journey of discovery \"more important to the central plot.\"[3]\n\n\n\n### Publication[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n*Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets* won the Nestl\u00e9 Smarties Book Prize 1998 Gold Medal in the 9\u201311 years division.[24] Rowling also won two other Nestl\u00e9 Smarties Book Prizes for *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone* and *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban*. The Scottish Arts Council awarded their first ever Children's Book Award to the novel in 1999,[25] and it was also awarded Whitaker's Platinum Book Award in 2001.[19][26] In 2003, the novel was listed at number 23 on the BBC's survey The Big Read.[27]\n\n\n\n## Main themes[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n29. **^** Cockrell, Amanda (2004). \"Harry Potter and the Secret Password\".

Soon after, Mr Filch's cat, Mrs Norris, is found petrified, along with a bloody warning scrawled on a wall: \"The Chamber of Secrets has been opened. Enemies of the heir, beware\". Salazar Slytherin, one of the school's founders, created the Chamber after a dispute with fellow founders on admitting Muggle-born students. Some in the wizarding community disdain Muggle-born wizards like Hermione, believing pure-bloods are superior. The Chamber supposedly houses a monster that only the Heir of Slytherin can control.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n24. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"ABOUT J.K. ROWLING\". Raincoast Books. 2009.

In *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets* Harry's consideration and respect for others extends to the lowly, non-human Dobby and the ghost Nearly Headless Nick.[30] According to Marguerite Krause, achievements in the novel depend more on ingenuity and hard work than on natural talents.[31]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n*Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets* continues to examine what makes a person who he or she is, which began in the first book. As well as maintaining that Harry's identity is shaped by his decisions rather than any aspect of his birth,[15][28] *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets* provides contrasting characters who try to conceal their true personalities: as Tammy Nezol puts it, Gilderoy Lockhart \"lacks any real identity\" because he is nothing more than a charming liar.[15] Riddle also complicates Harry's struggle to understand himself by pointing out the similarities between the two: \"both half-bloods, orphans raised by Muggles, probably the only two Parselmouths to come to Hogwarts since the great Slytherin.\"[29]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWriting after all seven books had been published, Graeme Davis regarded *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets* as the weakest of the series, and agreed that the plot structure is much the same as in *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*. He described Fawkes's appearance to arm Harry and then to heal him as a *deus ex machina*: he said that the book does not explain how Fawkes knew where to find Harry; and Fawkes's timing had to be very precise, as arriving earlier would probably have prevented the battle with the basilisk, while arriving later would have been fatal to Harry and Ginny.[18]\n\n\n\n### Awards and honours[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nEdward Duffy, associate professor at Marquette University, says that one of the central characters of *Chamber of Secrets* is Tom Riddle's enchanted diary, which takes control of Ginny Weasley \u2013 just as Riddle planned. Duffy suggests Rowling intended this as a warning against passively consuming information from sources that have their own agendas.[32] Although Bronwyn Williams and Amy Zenger regard the diary as more like an instant messaging or chat room system, they agree about the dangers of relying too much on the written word, which can camouflage the author, and they highlight a comical example, Lockhart's self-promoting books.[33]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSeveral commentators have noted that personal identity is a strong theme in the book and that it addresses issues of racism through the treatment of non-human, non-magical, and non-living people. Some commentators regard the story's diary that writes back as a warning against uncritical acceptance of information from sources whose motives and reliability cannot be checked. Institutional authority is portrayed as self-serving and incompetent.\n\n\nThe film adaptation of the novel, released in 2002, became (at the time) the sixth highest-grossing film ever and received generally favourable reviews. Video games loosely based on *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets* were also released for several platforms, and most obtained favourable reviews.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHarry, Ron, Ginny, and Lockhart return to the castle. Harry gives the diary to Dumbledore. Lucius bursts in, furious that Dumbledore returned. He is accompanied by Dobby, who is the Malfoys' house-elf and was working to protect Harry. Harry realizes that Lucius slipped the diary into Ginny's cauldron while they were in Diagon Alley to open the Chamber. Harry tricks Lucius into freeing Dobby from servitude by giving him a sock; Lucius attempts to attack Harry in revenge, but Dobby repels him.\n\n\nThe petrified students are cured, Gryffindor wins the House Cup again, Hagrid is released, Lockhart is confined to St. Mungo's Hospital, and Harry returns to Privet Drive in high spirits.\n\n\n\n## Publication and reception[edit]\n\n\n### Development[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWhile spending the summer at the Dursleys, twelve-year-old Harry Potter is visited by Dobby, a house-elf. He says Harry is in danger and must not return to Hogwarts. Harry refuses, so Dobby magically ruins Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon's dinner party. Furious, Uncle Vernon locks Harry into his room. The Ministry of Magic sends a notice accusing Harry of performing underage magic and threatening dismissal from Hogwarts.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring a Quidditch game, a rogue Bludger strikes Harry, breaking his arm. Lockhart blunders an attempt to repair it, sending Harry to the hospital overnight. Dobby visits Harry and reveals he jinxed the Bludger and sealed the portal at King's Cross. He says the Chamber of Secrets was once opened years before. After another attack, students attend a defensive duelling class, during which Harry exhibits a rare ability to speak 'Parseltongue', the language of snakes.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMarguerite Krause states there are few absolute moral rules in Harry Potter's world, for example Harry prefers to tell the truth, but lies whenever he considers it necessary\u00a0\u2013 very like his enemy Draco Malfoy.[31] At the end of *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets*, Dumbledore retracts his promise to punish Harry and Ron if they break any more school rules \u2013 after Professor McGonagall estimates they have broken over 100\u00a0\u2013 and lavishly rewards them for ending the threat from the Chamber of Secrets.[34] Krause further states that authority figures and political institutions receive little respect from Rowling.[31] William MacNeil of Griffith University, Queensland, Australia states that the Minister for Magic is presented as a mediocrity.[35] In his article \"Harry Potter and the Secular City\", Ken Jacobson suggests the Ministry as a whole is portrayed as a tangle of bureaucratic empires, saying that \"Ministry officials busy themselves with minutiae (e.g. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHowever, he enjoyed the parody of celebrities and their fans that centres round Gilderoy Lockhart, and approved of the book's handling of racism.[14] Tammy Nezol found the book more disturbing than its predecessor, particularly in the rash behaviour of Harry and his friends after Harry withholds information from Dumbledore, and in the human-like behaviour of the mandragoras used to make a potion that cures petrification. Nevertheless, she considered the second story as enjoyable as the first.[15]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Groups | * Hogwarts staff\n* Order of the Phoenix\n* Dumbledore's Army\n* Death Eaters\n |\n\n |\n| Fictional universe | * Magic\n\t+ creatures\n\t+ objects\n\t+ Ministry of Magic\n* Muggle\n* Places\n\t+ Hogwarts\n\t+ Beauxbatons\n* Quidditch\n |\n| Other works | * Wizarding World Digital\n* *The Cursed Child*\n* *Hogwarts Tournament of Houses*\n* *20th Anniversary: Return to Hogwarts*\n |\n| Inspired media | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione suspect Draco is the Heir, given his hostility toward Muggle-borns.

While there, Harry is warned that a former follower of Voldemort, named Sirius Black, is seeking him out after having escaped from the wizard prison, Azkaban.\n\n\nAt Hogwarts, the guards of Azkaban, known as the Dementors, patrol the school looking for Black. Harry is unusually affected by their presence, and asks help from Remus Lupin, the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, in learning to repel them. Lupin teaches Harry the incredibly difficult Patronus charm, but Harry is able to produce a full-bodied Patronus to fight off the Dementors.

He instructs them to save Black, by going back in time and setting him free, before he is handed over to the Dementors. Using a Time Turner, which Hermione has had since the beginning of the year to get to all her classes, they travel back a few hours. Present-day Harry saves his past self, and the past versions of Hermione and Black from Dementors using a Patronus. He then allows Black to be captured by Snape, before using Hagrid's hippogriff, Buckbeak, to release him from the tower and escape. \n\n\nThe next day, Lupin is forced to resign as his secret identity as a werewolf is now known to the school. Harry is upset at not spending more time with his godfather, Black, but Dumbledore asks him to take comfort in having saved his life. On the train journey back to London, Harry receives a letter from Black, who also sends a replacement pet owl for Ron.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Films produced | * *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 1* (2010)\n* *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2* (2011)\n |\n| Films producedand written | * *Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them* (2016)\n* *Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald* (2018)\n* *Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore* (2022)\n |\n| TV series produced | * *The Casual Vacancy* (2015)\n* *Strike* (2017\u2013present)\n |\n\n |\n| Other works | * *The Casual Vacancy* (2012)\n* *Harry Potter and the Cursed Child* (2016)\n* *The Ickabog* (2020)\n* *The Christmas Pig* (2021)\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nBooks I Love Best Yearly: Older Readers Award\n |\n| --- |\n| * *The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, Aged 13\u00be* by Sue Townsend (1990)\n* *The Outsiders* by S.

The first, *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*, was published by Bloomsbury on 26 June 1997. The second, *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets*, was published on 2 July 1998. The third, *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban*, followed on 8 July 1999.[1] *Goblet of Fire* is almost twice the size of the first three books (the paperback edition was 636 pages). Rowling stated that she \"knew from the beginning it would be the biggest of the first four.\" She said there needed to be a \"proper run-up\" for the conclusion and rushing the \"complex plot\" could confuse readers. She also stated that \"everything is on a bigger scale,\" which was symbolic, as Harry's horizons widened both literally and metaphorically as he grew up. She also wanted to explore more of the magical world.[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n***Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire*** is a fantasy novel written by British author J. K. Rowling and the fourth novel in the *Harry Potter* series. It follows Harry Potter, a wizard in his fourth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and the mystery surrounding the entry of Harry's name into the Triwizard Tournament, in which he is forced to compete.\n\n\nThe book was published in the United Kingdom by Bloomsbury and in the United States by Scholastic. In both countries, the release date was 8 July 2000. This was the first time a book in the series was published in both countries at the same time. The novel won a Hugo Award, the only *Harry Potter* novel to do so, in 2001. The book was adapted into a film, released worldwide on 18 November 2005, and a video game by Electronic Arts.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n*Goblet of Fire* was the first book in the Harry Potter series to be released in the United States on the same date as the United Kingdom, on 8 July 2000, strategically on a Saturday so children did not have to worry about school conflicting with buying the book.[1] It had a combined first-printing of over five million copies.[1] It was given a record-breaking print run of 3.9 million. Three million copies of the book were sold over the first weekend in the US alone.[5] FedEx dispatched more than 9,000 trucks and 100 planes to fulfil book deliveries.[6] The pressure in editing caused a mistake which shows Harry's father emerging first from Voldemort's wand; however, as confirmed in *Prisoner of Azkaban*, James died first, so then Harry's mother ought to have come out first.[7] This was corrected in later editions.[8]\n\n\n\n#### Launch publicity[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n12. **^** Pigott, Nick, ed.

In *The New York Times* Book Review, author Stephen King stated the *Goblet of Fire* was \"every bit as good as Potters\u00a01 through 3\" and praised the humour and subplots, although he commented that \"there's also a moderately tiresome amount of adolescent squabbling...it's a teenage thing\".[13] *Kirkus Reviews* called it \"another grand tale of magic and mystery...and clicking along so smoothly that it seems shorter than it is\". However, they commented that it did tend to lag, especially at the end where two \"bad guys\" stopped the action to give extended explanations, and that the issues to be resolved in sequels would leave \"many readers, particularly American ones, uncomfortable\".[14] For *The Horn Book Magazine*, Martha V. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n24. **^** \"Harry Potter series\".

Previously, in April, the publisher had listed it as *Harry Potter and the Doomspell Tournament*. However,[3] J.\u00a0K. Rowling expressed her indecision about the title in an *Entertainment Weekly* interview.\n\"I changed my mind twice on what [the title] was. The working title had got out\u00a0\u2014 *Harry Potter and the Doomspell Tournament*. Then I changed *Doomspell* to *Triwizard Tournament*. Then I was teetering between *Goblet of Fire* and *Triwizard Tournament*. In the end, I preferred *Goblet of Fire* because it's got that kind of *cup of destiny* feel about it, which is the theme of the book.\"[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nKristin Lemmerman of CNN said that it is not great literature: 'Her prose has more in common with your typical beach-blanket fare and the beginning contained too much recap to introduce characters to new readers, although Rowling quickly gets back on track, introducing readers to a host of well-drawn new characters.'[18] Writing for Salon.com, Charles Taylor was generally positive about the change of mood and development of characters.[19] *Entertainment Weekly*'s reviewer Kristen Baldwin gave *Goblet of Fire* the grade of A\u2212, praising the development of the characters as well as the many themes presented. However, she did worry that a shocking climax may be a \"nightmare factory\" for young readers.[20]\n\n\nIn 2012 it was ranked number 98 on a list of the top 100 children's novels published by *School Library Journal*.[21]\n\n\n\n### Awards and honours[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| *Harry Potter* | * *The Philosopher's Stone* (1997)\n* *The Chamber of Secrets* (1998)\n* *The Prisoner of Azkaban* (1999)\n* *The Goblet of Fire* (2000)\n* *The Order of the Phoenix* (2003)\n* *The Half-Blood Prince* (2005)\n* *The Deathly Hallows* (2007)\n |\n| Other | * *Quidditch Through the Ages* (2001)\n* *Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them* (2001)\n* Harry Potter prequel (2008)\n* *The Tales of Beedle the Bard* (2008)\n* *Hogwarts: An Incomplete and Unreliable Guide* (2016)\n* *Short Stories from Hogwarts of Power, Politics and Pesky Poltergeists* (2016)\n* *Short Stories from Hogwarts of Heroism, Hardship and Dangerous Hobbies* (2016)\n |\n\n |\n| *Cormoran Strike*books | * *The Cuckoo's Calling* (2013)\n* *The Silkworm* (2014)\n* *Career of Evil* (2015)\n* *Lethal White* (2018)\n* *Troubled Blood* (2020)\n* *The Ink Black Heart* (2022)\n* *The Running Grave* (2023)\n |\n| Films andTV series | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n7. **^** Rowling, J.K. \"At the end of 'Goblet of Fire', in which order should Harry's parents have come out of the wand?\".

The match ends in a victory for the Irish, but the campsite is attacked by Voldemort's former followers called the Death Eaters. Nobody is killed, but the Dark Mark is set off and found to have been cast by Barty Crouch's house-elf, Winky.\n\n\nHogwarts reopens and a new tournament is announced between three schools to compete for the Triwizard Cup. The other competing schools are Beauxbatons and Durmstrang. Students excitedly await the start of the Tournament, which is declared open after the visiting teams arrive. The Goblet of Fire, a magical object tasked with selecting the champions, is unveiled. It names three champions from each of the schools, then selects Harry as a fourth champion, despite him being underage.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nJeff Jensen, who interviewed Rowling for *Entertainment Weekly* in 2000, pointed out that bigotry is a big theme in the *Harry Potter* novels and *Goblet of Fire* in particular. He mentioned how Voldemort and his followers are prejudiced against Muggles and how, in *Goblet of Fire,* Hermione forms a group to liberate Hogwarts' house-elves who have \"been indentured servants so long they lack desire for anything else.\"[2] When asked why she explored this theme, Rowling replied,\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Main novels | * *The Philosopher's Stone*\n* *The Chamber of Secrets*\n* *The Prisoner of Azkaban*\n* *The Goblet of Fire*\n* *The Order of the Phoenix*\n* *The Half-Blood Prince*\n* *The Deathly Hallows*\n |\n| Spin-offs | * *Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them*\n* *Quidditch Through the Ages*\n* *The Tales of Beedle the Bard*\n |\n| Short stories | * Prequel\n* *Hogwarts: An Incomplete and Unreliable Guide*\n* *Short Stories from Hogwarts of Power, Politics and Pesky Poltergeists*\n* *Short Stories from Hogwarts of Heroism, Hardship and Dangerous Hobbies*\n |\n\n |\n| Feature films | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Films produced | * *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 1* (2010)\n* *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2* (2011)\n |\n| Films producedand written | * *Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them* (2016)\n* *Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald* (2018)\n* *Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore* (2022)\n |\n| TV series produced | * *The Casual Vacancy* (2015)\n* *Strike* (2017\u2013present)\n |\n\n |\n| Other works | * *The Casual Vacancy* (2012)\n* *Harry Potter and the Cursed Child* (2016)\n* *The Ickabog* (2020)\n* *The Christmas Pig* (2021)\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Groups | * Hogwarts staff\n* Order of the Phoenix\n* Dumbledore's Army\n* Death Eaters\n |\n\n |\n| Fictional universe | * Magic\n\t+ creatures\n\t+ objects\n\t+ Ministry of Magic\n* Muggle\n* Places\n\t+ Hogwarts\n\t+ Beauxbatons\n* Quidditch\n |\n| Other works | * Wizarding World Digital\n* *The Cursed Child*\n* *Hogwarts Tournament of Houses*\n* *20th Anniversary: Return to Hogwarts*\n |\n| Inspired media | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Related | * Influences and analogues\n* Legal disputes\n* List of organisms named after the *Harry Potter* series\n* Politics\n* Portkey Games\n* Religious debates\n* Translation\n* *Harry, A History*\n* *Harry Potter and the Sacred Text*\n* *The Harry Potter Lexicon*\n* *The Magical Worlds of Harry Potter*\n* *Pollomuhku ja Posityyhtynen*\n* *Potterless*\n* Heyday Films\n |\n| * ![](image) Category\n* ![](image) Outline\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nWorks by J.

All forms of intolerance, the whole idea of *that which is different from me is necessarily evil.* I really like to explore the idea that difference is equal and good. But there's another idea that I like to explore, too. Oppressed groups are not, generally speaking, people who stand firmly together \u2013 no, sadly, they kind of subdivide among themselves and fight like hell. That's human nature, so that's what you see here. This world of wizards and witches, they're already ostracized, and then within themselves, they've formed a loathsome pecking order.[2]\n> \n> \n\n\nShe also commented that she did not feel this was too \"heavy\" for children, as it was one of those things that a \"huge number of children at that age start to think about.\"[2]\n\n\n\n## Publication and reception[edit]\n\n\n### UK/US release[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe students perceive Harry has cheated and turn on him. Rubeus Hagrid believes Harry's innocence and shows him the dragons involved in the First Task. Harry alerts Cedric Diggory, son of Amos Diggory, to the challenge and is helped by \"Mad-Eye\" Moody, ex-Auror and the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, to prepare for the task. Using his superior flying skills, Harry gets past the dragon and retrieves a clue for the next task.\n\n\nA Yule Ball is announced and Harry must find a partner, as champions traditionally commence the opening dance. Harry and Ron Weasley struggle initially to get partners, but end up going with the \"prettiest girls in their year\" - Parvati and Padma Patil. Ron gets jealous seeing Hermione Granger with Viktor Krum, the Durmstrang champion, and spends the night arguing with her. Harry is sullen that Cho Chang is with Cedric, the other Hogwarts champion. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Video games | * *Lego Creator: Harry Potter*\n* *The Philosopher's Stone* (2001)\n\t+ PC\n\t+ Game Boy Advance\n\t+ Game Boy Color\n* *The Chamber of Secrets*\n* *Creator: Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets*\n* *Quidditch World Cup*\n* *The Philosopher's Stone* (2003)\n* *The Prisoner of Azkaban*\n* *The Goblet of Fire*\n* *The Order of the Phoenix*\n* *The Half-Blood Prince*\n* *Lego Harry Potter: Years 1\u20134*\n* *The Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 1*\n* *The Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2*\n* *Lego Harry Potter: Years 5\u20137*\n* *Book of Spells*\n* *Book of Potions*\n* *Lego Dimensions*\n* *Fantastic Beasts: Cases From the Wizarding World*\n* *Hogwarts Mystery*\n* *Wizards Unite*\n* *Magic Awakened*\n* *Hogwarts Legacy*\n* *Quidditch Champions*\n |\n| Attractions | * The Wizarding World of Harry Potter\n\t+ Orlando\n\t+ Japan\n\t+ Hollywood\n\t+ Dragon Challenge\n\t+ Flight of the Hippogriff\n\t+ Hagrid's Magical Creatures Motorbike Adventure\n\t+ The Escape from Gringotts\n\t+ The Forbidden Journey\n\t+ Hogwarts Express\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Quidditch field is prepared for the Third (and final) Task, and requires champions to overcome a maze filled with obstacles. Harry and Cedric succeed in reaching the centre, where the Triwizard Cup is placed. They touch it together, but are transported outside Hogwarts to a graveyard. Cedric believes this is part of the Task, but Harry gets alerted when his scar starts burning wildly. Wormtail arrives with Voldemort and kills Cedric with the latter's wand. He then uses Harry's blood to restore a frail Voldemort back to his full, physical body. Voldemort summons his Death Eaters and tries to kill Harry in front of them. He fails when his and Harry's wandstreams connect, in a rare phenomenon called Priori Incantatem. This causes a distraction by seeming to summon the ghosts of those that Voldermort\u2019s wand has killed, including Harry\u2019s parents, allowing Harry to escape back to Hogwarts using the Cup.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCrouch Jr is handed over to the Dementors. Harry recovers in the hospital wing, surrounded by Ron, Hermione and the Weasleys. He meets with Cedric's grieving parents, while Dumbledore makes plans to prepare the wizarding world for Voldemort's return. The school year ends and Harry returns to live with the Dursleys again for the summer.\n\n\n\n## Development[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRowling mentioned that she originally wrote a Weasley relative named Malfalda, who, according to Rowling, \"was the daughter of the 'second cousin who's a stockbroker' mentioned in *Philosopher's Stone*. This stockbroker had been very rude to Mr. and Mrs.\u00a0Weasley in the past, but now he and his (Muggle) wife had inconveniently produced a witch, they came back to the Weasleys asking for their help in introducing her to wizarding society before she starts at Hogwarts.\"[4] Malfalda was supposed to be a Slytherin and was to fill in the Rita Skeeter subplot, but she was eventually removed because \"there were obvious limitations to what an eleven-year-old closeted at school could discover.\" Rowling considered Rita Skeeter to be \"much more flexible.\"[4] Rowling also admitted that the fourth book was the most difficult to write at the time because the Malfalda character also served as a giant plot hole, which she discovered halfway through writing.[2]\n\n\n\n## Themes[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAt Hogwarts, Moody pulls Harry into his office to question him and Harry realises that he is a Death Eater. He is saved by the arrival of Dumbledore, McGonagall and Snape, who force Moody to reveal himself to be Barty Crouch Jr, a Death Eater formerly presumed dead. He had been imprisoned in Azkaban for supporting Voldemort and had escaped by leaving his mother in his place using Polyjuice Potion. Crouch Jr had then been placed under the Imperius Curse by his father until he had managed to break out of it during the Quidditch World Cup and cast the Dark Mark. He had then imprisoned the real Moody and impersonated him using more Polyjuice Potion. Arriving at Hogwarts, he made sure that Harry won the Tournament and was transported to the graveyard for Voldemort's ritual; his only wish is that Voldemort rise to the power he once had. His father had been placed under the Imperius Curse after Crouch Jr's escape, but had started to resist it and so had been killed. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* *Startide Rising* by David Brin (1984)\n* *Neuromancer* by William Gibson (1985)\n* *Ender's Game* by Orson Scott Card (1986)\n* *Speaker for the Dead* by Orson Scott Card (1987)\n* *The Uplift War* by David Brin (1988)\n* *Cyteen* by C.

K. Rowling and the fifth novel in the *Harry Potter* series. It follows Harry Potter's struggles through his fifth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, including the surreptitious return of the antagonist Lord Voldemort, O.W.L. exams, and an obstructive Ministry of Magic. The novel was published on 21 June 2003 by Bloomsbury in the United Kingdom, Scholastic in the United States, and Raincoast in Canada. It sold five million copies in the first 24 hours of publication.[1]\n\n\n*Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix* won several awards, including the American Library Association Best Book Award for Young Adults in 2003. The book was also made into a 2007 film, and a video game by Electronic Arts.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nDuring the summer, Harry Potter is frustrated by his friends' non-communication and with Dumbledore barring him from helping combat a newly-resurgent Lord Voldemort. One evening, Dementors attack him and cousin Dudley, but Harry fends them off using the Patronus Charm. Later, Order of the Phoenix members arrive at the Dursley house to evacuate Harry. They whisk him off to Number 12, Grimmauld Place, Sirius Black's family home, which is now the Order's headquarters. Ron and Hermione are there and tell Harry that the Order is a secret organisation that Dumbledore created to fight Voldemort and the Death Eaters. Harry wants to join but is still too young. \n\n\nThe Ministry of Magic, under Cornelius Fudge, attempt to malign Harry for stating that Voldemort has returned. Harry is also charged with performing underage magic while with a Muggle, but is exonerated and returns to Hogwarts. Dolores Umbridge, a senior Ministry employee, is the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. She initiates strict rules and a textbook-only curriculum and forbids the students from practicing defensive spells. Harry, Ron, and Hermione form a secret student Defense group called Dumbledore's Army. The group secretly meets in the Room of Requirement to practice under Harry's instruction.\n\n\nOne night, Harry dreams that Arthur Weasley is attacked by Voldemort's snake, Nagini. His vision is true, and Arthur is found seriously injured at the Ministry. Dumbledore realises that Harry's and Voldemort's minds are connected, and he orders Professor Snape to teach Harry Occlumency, a skill to close one's mind against others. Umbridge is tipped-off about Dumbledore's Army; to prevent Harry's expulsion, Dumbledore claims responsibility for forming the group. To avoid arrest, he goes into hiding. Umbridge is appointed headmistress, though she is magically barred from entering Dumbledore's tower. She begins enacting strict rules and regulations and attempts to dismiss Professor Trelawney.\n\n\nHarry's Occlumency lessons go poorly. During his Ordinary Wizarding Level exams, he envisions Voldemort torturing Sirius in the Department of Mysteries at the Ministry. Harry attempts to contact Sirius at Grimmauld Place, using the Floo Network in Umbridge's office, but she catches and interrogates him, threatening to use the Cruciatus Curse on him. Hermione intervenes by concocting a story that leads them into the Forbidden Forest. Umbridge provokes the centaurs, who take her captive. \n\n\nHarry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Neville and Luna fly to the Ministry to save Sirius, but he is not in the Department of Mysteries. Instead, the room in his vision has shelves filled with glass spheres, one of which bears Harry's and Voldemort's names. Harry picks it up and is immediately surrounded by Death Eaters. Lucius Malfoy reveals that Harry was lured there by a fake vision from Voldemort, and that he wishes to hear the prophecy contained in the glass sphere. He asks Harry for the sphere, but Harry refuses. The Hogwarts group fight the Death Eaters and evade them. Order of the Phoenix members (tipped off by Professor Snape) arrive and battle the Death Eaters. Neville accidentally drops the prophecy sphere, breaking it. Later during the battle, Bellatrix Lestrange kills Sirius. \n\n\nHarry chases Bellatrix into the atrium. Voldemort appears and tries to kill Harry, but Dumbledore appears and thwarts him. Fudge and other Ministry of Magic employees arrive on the scene and witness Voldemort just before he escapes. In his office, Dumbledore tells Harry the prophecy was made by Professor Trelawney, who predicted the birth of a child with power against Voldemort. This caused Voldemort to pursue Harry's parents, and is why he targets Harry. Overwhelmed by the prophecy and mourning Sirius' death, Harry grows sullen, although the wizarding community now believes and respects him. Supported by his friends, Harry is able to endure another summer with the Dursleys.\n\n\n\n## Publication and release[edit]\n\n\n*Potter* fans waited three years between the releases of the fourth and fifth books.[2][3] Before the release of the fifth book, 200\u00a0million copies of the first four books had already been sold and translated into 55\u00a0languages in 200\u00a0countries.[4] As the series was already a global phenomenon, the book forged new pre-order records, with thousands of people queuing outside book stores on 20 June 2003\u00a0to secure copies at midnight.[4] Despite the security, thousands of copies were stolen from an Earlestown, Merseyside warehouse on 15 June 2003.[5]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\n*Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix* was met with mostly positive reviews and received several awards. In 2004, the book was cited as an American Library Association Best Book for Young Adults and as an American Library Association Notable Book.[6][7] It also received the Oppenheim Toy Portfolio 2004 Gold Medal, along with several other awards.[8] Rowling was praised for her imagination by *USA Today* writer Deirdre Donahue.[9]\n*The New York Times* writer John Leonard praised the novel, saying \"*The Order of the Phoenix* starts slow, gathers speed and then skateboards, with somersaults, to its furious conclusion....As Harry gets older, Rowling gets better.\"[10] However, he also criticised \"the one-note Draco Malfoy\" and the predictable Lord Voldemort.[10]\n\n\n\n### Predecessors and sequels[edit]\n\n\n*Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix* is the fifth book in the *Harry Potter* series.[2] The first book in the series, *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,* was first published by Bloomsbury in 1997 with an initial print-run of 500\u00a0copies in hardback, 300 of which were distributed to libraries.

Rowling and the sixth and penultimate novel in the *Harry Potter* series.

It sold almost seven million copies in the first 24\u00a0hours after its release,[1] a record eventually broken by its sequel, *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows*.[2] There were many controversies before and after it was published, including the right-to-read copies delivered before the release date in Canada. Reception to the novel was generally positive, and it won several awards and honours, including the 2006 British Book of the Year award.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n*Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince* is the sixth book in the Harry Potter series.[3] The first book in the series, *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*, was first published by Bloomsbury in 1997, with an initial print-run of 500 copies in hardback, 300 of which were distributed to libraries.[4] By the end of 1997, the UK edition won a National Book Award and a gold medal in the 9-\u00a0to\u00a011-year-olds category of the Nestl\u00e9 Smarties Book Prize.[5] The second book, *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets*, was initially published in the UK on 2 July 1998 and in the US on 2 June 1999.[6][7] *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban* was then published a year later in the UK on 8 July 1999 and in the US on 8 September 1999.[6][7] *Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire* was published on 8 July 2000 at the same time by Bloomsbury and Scholastic.[8] *Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix*, the longest novel in the Harry Potter series, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n60. **^** \"Scholastic Releases Exclusive Artwork for Deluxe Edition of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\" (Press release).

Liesl Schillinger of *The New York Times* praised the novel's various themes and suspenseful ending. However, she considered Rowling's gift \"not so much for language as for characterisation and plotting.\"[32] *Kirkus Reviews* said it \"will leave readers pleased, amused, excited, scared, infuriated, delighted, sad, surprised, thoughtful and likely wondering where Voldemort has got to, since he appears only in flashbacks.\" They considered Rowling's \"wry wit\" to turn into \"outright merriment\" but called the climax \"tragic, but not uncomfortably shocking.\"[36] Yvonne Zipp of *The Christian Science Monitor* praised the way Rowling evolved Harry into a teenager and how the plot threads found as far back as *Chamber of Secrets* came into play. On the other hand, she noted it \"gets a little exposition-heavy in spots,\" and older readers may have seen the ending coming.[29]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nRowling stated that she had *Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince* \"planned for years,\" but she spent two months revisiting her plan before she began writing the story's first draft. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n24. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Malvern, Jack; Cleroux, Richard (13 July 2005). \"Reading ban on leaked Harry Potter\". *The Times*.

In May 2005, bookmakers in the UK suspended bets on which main character would die in the book amid fears of insider knowledge. A number of high-value bets were made on the death of Albus Dumbledore, many coming from the town of Bungay where it was believed the books were being printed at the time. Betting was later reopened.[22] Additionally, in response to Greenpeace's campaign on using forest friendly paper for big-name authors, Bloomsbury published the book on 30% recycled paper.[23]\n\n\n\n### Right-to-read controversy[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn early July 2005, a Real Canadian Superstore in Coquitlam, British Columbia, Canada, accidentally sold fourteen copies of *The Half-Blood Prince* before the authorised release date. The Canadian publisher, Raincoast Books, obtained an injunction from the Supreme Court of British Columbia that prohibited the purchasers from reading the books before the official release date or discussing the contents.[24] Purchasers were offered Harry Potter T-shirts and autographed copies of the book if they returned their copies before 16 July.[24]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n18. **^** Rowling, J.K.

Snape easily deflects it. Snape taunts Harry for using his own spell against him and reveals that he is the Half-Blood Prince. Snape escapes with Draco through the ensuing battle between Death Eaters and the Order of the Phoenix. Dumbledore's lifeless body is found at the base of Astronomy Tower. Representatives from all wizarding races attend his funeral. Later, Harry discovers that the Locket Horcrux is fake, switched by someone whose initials are, R.A.B.

On the Hogwarts Express, Harry, wearing his Invisibility Cloak, overhears Draco claim he may not return to Hogwarts the following year to instead, \"go on to better things.\" Harry suspects that Draco may have become a Death Eater. During the Welcome Feast, Slughorn is introduced as the new Potions teacher while Snape is now the Defence Against the Dark Arts instructor. Harry and Ron take Slughorn's advanced potions class. Harry finds a tattered potions textbook bearing the inscription, 'The Half-Blood Prince.' The book contains tips, as well as new spells, scribbled in the book margins that yield better results than the printed instructions. With it, Harry rises to the top of the class and wins a vial of Felix Felicis, a luck-enhancing potion. Hermione says Harry is cheating while Slughorn compares his potions skill to his mother, Lily.\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
