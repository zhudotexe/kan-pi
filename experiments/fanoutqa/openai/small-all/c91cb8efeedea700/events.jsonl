For countries in which the head of state and head of government are separate, both offices are listed. For leaders who held the same office prior to their state's independence, the start of their tenure is used, not independence. For a list of heads of state taking dates of independence into account, see List of heads of state by diplomatic precedence.\n\n\nActing presidents are included in this list, but if a leader has non-consecutive terms, only the current period of service is listed.\n\n\nStates where head of state differs from head of government are mainly parliamentary systems. Often a leader holds both positions in presidential systems or dictatorships. Some states have semi-presidential systems where the head of government role is fulfilled by both the listed head of government and the head of state.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 15 September 2013  | Edi Rama | ![](image) Albania | Prime Minister |\n| 23 November 2013\n | Kokhir Rasulzoda | ![](image) Tajikistan | Prime Minister |\n| 25 January 2014\n | Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan[43] | ![](image) United Arab Emirates  | *de facto* President: 25 January 2014 – 13 May 2022[44]President: 14 May 2022 – present\n |\n| 27 April 2014\n | Aleksandar Vučić | ![](image) Serbia | Prime Minister: 27 April 2014 – 30 May 2017President: 31 May 2017 – present\n |\n| 26 May 2014\n | Narendra Modi | ![](image) India | Prime Minister |\n| 8 June 2014\n | Abdel Fattah el-Sisi | ![](image) Egypt | President |\n| 13 June 2014\n | Gaston Browne | ![](image) Antigua and Barbuda | Prime Minister |\n| 19 June 2014\n | Felipe VI | ![](image) Spain | King |\n| 14 August 2014\n | Rodney Williams | ![](image) Antigua and Barbuda | Governor-General[33] |\n| 20 October 2014\n | Joko Widodo | ![](image) Indonesia | President |\n| 21 December 2014\n | Klaus Iohannis | ![](image) Romania | President |\n\n\n### 2015–2017[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 27 April 1991[10] | Isaias Afwerki | ![](image) Eritrea | Secretary-General of the Provisional Government: 27 April 1991 – 23 May 1993President: 23 May 1993 – presentChairman of the People's Front: 1 March 1994 – present |\n| 19 November 1992  | Emomali Rahmon | ![](image) Tajikistan | Acting Chairman of the Supreme Council: 19 November 1992 – 27 November 1992Chairman of the Supreme Council: 27 November 1992 – 16 November 1994President: 16 November 1994 – present\n |\n| 20 July 1994\n | Alexander Lukashenko | ![](image) Belarus | President[11] |\n| 7 February 1996\n | Letsie III | ![](image) Lesotho | King[12] |\n| 25 October 1997\n | Denis Sassou Nguesso | ![](image) Congo-Brazzaville | President[13] |\n| 3 March 1998\n | Henri | ![](image) Luxembourg | Prince-regent: 3 March 1998 – 7 October 2000Grand Duke: 7 October 2000 – present\n |\n| 25 January 1999\n | Abdullah II | ![](image) Jordan | Prince-regent: 25 January 1999 – 7 February 1999King: 7 February 1999 – present\n |\n| 6 March 1999\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n29. **^** The People's Council of Turkmenistan was the upper legislative chamber until 21 January 2023, when it was re-formed as the country's top leadership body, with the chairman being designated the \"National Leader of the Turkmen People\".

For countries in which the head of state and head of government are separate, both offices are listed. For leaders who held the same office prior to their state's independence, the start of their tenure is used, not independence. For a list of heads of state taking dates of independence into account, see List of heads of state by diplomatic precedence.\n\n\nActing presidents are included in this list, but if a leader has non-consecutive terms, only the current period of service is listed.\n\n\nStates where head of state differs from head of government are mainly parliamentary systems. Often a leader holds both positions in presidential systems or dictatorships. Some states have semi-presidential systems where the head of government role is fulfilled by both the listed head of government and the head of state.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n## List of state leaders by date of assuming office[edit]\n\n\n### Prior to 2000[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Assumed office\n | Leader\n | State\n | Office\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 29 May 2010\n | Viktor Orbán | ![](image) Hungary | Prime Minister[34] |\n| 14 October 2010\n | Mark Rutte | ![](image) Netherlands | Prime Minister |\n| 4 December 2010\n | Alassane Ouattara | ![](image) Ivory Coast | President[35] |\n| 19 January 2011\n | Nguyễn Phú Trọng | ![](image) Vietnam | General Secretary of the Communist Party: 19 January 2011 – presentPresident: 23 October 2018 – 5 April 2021\n |\n| 11 November 2011\n | Michael D.
