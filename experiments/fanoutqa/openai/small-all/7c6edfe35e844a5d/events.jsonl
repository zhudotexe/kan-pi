Frodo wanders off and is confronted by Boromir, who, as Lady Galadriel had warned, tries to take the Ring. Uruk-hai scouts then ambush the Fellowship, attempting to abduct the Hobbits. Boromir breaks free of the Ring's magic and protects Merry and Pippin, but the Uruk-Hai leader, Lurtz, mortally wounds Boromir as they abduct the Hobbits. Aragorn arrives and kills Lurtz before comforting Boromir as he dies, promising to help the people of Gondor in the coming conflict. Fearing the Ring will corrupt his friends, Frodo decides to travel to Mordor alone, but allows Sam to come along, recalling his promise to Gandalf to look after him. As Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli set out to rescue Merry and Pippin, Frodo and Sam make their way down the mountain pass of Emyn Muil, journeying on to Mordor. \n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Cast of *The Lord of the Rings* film series\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Billy Boyd as Peregrin Took: Better known as Pippin, an extremely foolish hobbit who is a distant cousin of Frodo and travels with the Fellowship on their journey to Mordor.\n* Dominic Monaghan as Meriadoc Brandybuck: Better known as Merry, a distant cousin of Frodo. Monaghan was cast as Merry after auditioning for Frodo.[12]\n* John Rhys-Davies as Gimli: A dwarf warrior who accompanies the Fellowship to Mordor after they set out from Rivendell. Billy Connolly, who was considered for the part of Gimli, would later portray Dáin II Ironfoot in Peter Jackson's *The Hobbit* film trilogy.[12] Rhys-Davies wore heavy prosthetics to play Gimli, which limited his vision, and eventually he developed eczema around his eyes.[7] Rhys-Davies also played Gimli's father Glóin during the scene where the fellowship is forged.\n* Orlando Bloom as Legolas: A prince of the elves' Woodland Realm and a skilled archer. Bloom initially auditioned for Faramir, who appears in the second film, a role which went to David Wenham.[12]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | 178 minutes[2] |\n| Countries | * New Zealand[1]\n* United States[1]\n |\n| Language | English |\n| Budget | $93 million[3] |\n| Box office | $898.2 million[4] |\n\n\n***The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring*** is a 2001 epic fantasy adventure film directed by Peter Jackson from a screenplay by Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens, and Jackson, based on 1954's *The Fellowship of the Ring*, the first volume of the novel *The Lord of the Rings* by J. R. R. Tolkien. The film is the first instalment in *The Lord of the Rings* trilogy. It features an ensemble cast including Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Liv Tyler, Viggo Mortensen, Sean Astin, Cate Blanchett, John Rhys-Davies, Billy Boyd, Dominic Monaghan, Orlando Bloom, Christopher Lee, Hugo Weaving, Sean Bean, Ian Holm, and Andy Serkis.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Sala Baker as Sauron:[30] The Dark Lord of Mordor and the Ring's true master, who manifests as an Eye after the destruction of his physical form.\n* Marton Csokas as Celeborn the Wise: The Elven-Lord of Lothlórien and Galadriel's husband.\n* Lawrence Makoare as Lurtz: The commander of Saruman's Uruk-Hai forces.\n* Craig Parker as Haldir: The leader of the Galadhrim warriors guarding the border of Lothlórien.\n* Mark Ferguson as Ereinion Gil-galad: The last Elven-King of the Noldor.\n* Peter McKenzie as Elendil the Tall: The last High King of Arnor and Gondor.\n* Harry Sinclair as Isildur: Elendil's son and Aragorn's ancestor who originally defeated Sauron.\n* Director Peter Jackson has a small cameo as a man with a carrot in Bree.\n\n\n## Comparison to the source material[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Peter Jackson's interpretation of The Lord of the Rings\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The eponymous Fellowship from left to right: (Top row) Aragorn, Gandalf, Legolas, Boromir, (bottom row) Sam, Frodo, Merry, Pippin, Gimli\nBefore filming began on 11 October 1999, the principal actors trained for six weeks in sword fighting (with Bob Anderson), riding and boating. Jackson hoped such activities would allow the cast to bond so chemistry would be evident on screen as well as getting them used to life in Wellington.[7] They were also trained to pronounce Tolkien's verses properly.[8] After the shoot, the nine cast members playing the Fellowship got a tattoo, the Elvish symbol for the number nine, with the exception of John Rhys-Davies, whose stunt double got the tattoo instead.[9] The film is noted for having an ensemble cast,[10] and some of the cast and their respective characters include:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Hugo Weaving as Elrond: The Elven-Lord of Rivendell who leads the Council of Elrond, which ultimately decides to destroy the Ring. David Bowie expressed interest in the role, but Jackson stated, \"To have a famous, beloved character and a famous star colliding is slightly uncomfortable.\"[13]\n* Ian Holm as Bilbo Baggins: Frodo's uncle who gives him the Ring after he decides to retire to Rivendell. Holm previously played Frodo in a 1981 radio adaption of *The Lord of the Rings*, and was cast as Bilbo after Jackson remembered his performance.[12] Sylvester McCoy, who would later play Radagast the Brown in *The Hobbit*, was contacted about playing the role, and was kept in place as a potential Bilbo for six months before Jackson went with Holm.[28]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Liv Tyler as Arwen: An elf of Rivendell and Aragorn's lover. The filmmakers approached Tyler after seeing her performance in *Plunkett & Macleane*, and New Line Cinema leaped at the opportunity of having one Hollywood star in the film. Actress Helena Bonham Carter had expressed interest in the role.[12] Tyler came to shoot on short occasions, unlike the rest of the actors. She was one of the last actors to be cast, on 25 August 1999.[26]\n* Cate Blanchett as Galadriel: The elven co-ruler of Lothlórien alongside her husband Celeborn. Lucy Lawless was considered for the role.[27]\n* Christopher Lee as Saruman the White: The fallen head of the Istari Order who succumbs to Sauron's will through his use of the *palantír*. Lee was a major fan of the book, and read it once a year. He had also met J. R. R. Tolkien.[23] He originally auditioned for Gandalf, but was judged too old.[12]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSet in Middle-earth, the story tells of the Dark Lord Sauron, who seeks the One Ring, which contains part of his might, to return to power. The Ring has found its way to the young hobbit Frodo Baggins. The fate of Middle-earth hangs in the balance as Frodo and eight companions (who form the Fellowship of the Ring) begin their perilous journey to Mount Doom in the land of Mordor, the only place where the Ring can be destroyed. *The Fellowship of the Ring* was financed and distributed by American studio New Line Cinema, but filmed and edited entirely in Jackson's native New Zealand, concurrently with the other two parts of the trilogy. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** \"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring\". *AFI Catalog of Feature Films*.

Sean Connery was approached for the role, but did not understand the plot,[12] while Patrick Stewart turned it down as he disliked the script.[15] Patrick McGoohan was also offered the role, but turned it down due to health issues.[16] Anthony Hopkins and Christopher Plummer also turned down the role.[17][18] Richard Harris expressed interest in the part.[19] John Astin auditioned for Gandalf.[20] Sam Neill was also offered the role but declined due to his scheduling conflict with *Jurassic Park III*. Before being cast, McKellen had to sort his schedule with 20th Century Fox as there was a two-month overlap with *X-Men*.[13] He enjoyed playing Gandalf the Grey more than his transformed state in the next two films,[9] and based his accent on Tolkien. Unlike his on-screen character, McKellen did not spend much time with the actors playing the Hobbits; instead he worked with their scale doubles.[7]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Adaptations and derivative works\n |\n| --- |\n| Books | * *Bored of the Rings* (1969)\n* *The Last Ringbearer* (1999)\n* *Muddle Earth* (2003)\n |\n| Illustrations | * A Map of Middle-earth\n\t+ Pauline Baynes\n\t+ Barbara Remington\n* John Howe\n* Alan Lee\n* Margrethe II of Denmark\n* Ted Nasmith\n |\n| Theatre | * *Fellowship!* (2005)\n* *Lord of the Rings* (2006)\n |\n| Music | * *Music Inspired by Lord of the Rings* (1972)\n* Symphony No. 1 *The Lord of the Rings* (1988)\n* Led Zeppelin\n\t+ \"Ramble On\" (1969)\n\t+ \"Misty Mountain Hop\" (1971)\n\t+ \"The Battle of Evermore\" (1971)\n |\n| Radio | * *The Lord of the Rings* (BBC, 1955)\n* *The Lord of the Rings* (NPR, 1979)\n* *Hordes of the Things* (1980)\n* *The Lord of the Rings* (BBC, 1981)\n* *Der Herr der Ringe* (1992)\n |\n| Film | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Animated | * *The Lord of the Rings* (Bakshi, 1978)\n* *The Return of the King* (Rankin/Bass, 1980)\n* *The War of the Rohirrim* (2024)\n |\n| Peter Jacksonseries | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Films | * *The Fellowship of the Ring* (2001)\n* *The Two Towers* (2002)\n* *The Return of the King* (2003)\n |\n| Aspects | * Accolades\n* Peter Jackson's interpretation\n* Music\n* Production\n |\n\n |\n| *The Hobbit* | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Films | * *An Unexpected Journey* (2012)\n* *The Desolation of Smaug* (2013)\n* *The Battle of the Five Armies* (2014)\n |\n| Aspects | * Accolades\n* Original characters\n* Music\n |\n\n |\n\n |\n| Television | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| TV films | * *Sagan om ringen* (1971)\n* *The Hobbit* (1985)\n* *Khraniteli* (1991)\n |\n| Series | * *Hobitit* (1993)\n* *The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power* (2022–present)\n\t+ music\n |\n\n |\n| Fan films | * *The Hunt for Gollum* (2009)\n* *Born of Hope* (2009)\n |\n\n |\n| * ![](image) Category\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n18. **^** https://variety.com/2023/film/features/ian-mckellen-retirement-gandalf-the-critic-toronto-1235710798/\n19. **^** https://www.contactmusic.com/ian-mckellen/news/mckellen.-harris-hated-me-thanks-to-gandalf\n20. **^** https://www.avclub.com/random-roles-john-astin-addams-family-frighteners-batma-1848715237\n21. ^ ***a*** ***b*** xoanon (15 October 1999). \"Daniel Day-Lewis Offered role of Aragorn, Again!\". *theonering.net*.

They instead set off over the mountain pass of Caradhras, but Saruman summons a storm that forces them to travel through the Mines of Moria, where a tentacled water beast blocks off the entrance with the Fellowship inside, giving them no choice but to journey to the exit on the other end. After finding the Dwarves of Moria dead, the Fellowship is attacked by Orcs and a cave troll. They hold them off but are confronted by Durin's Bane: a Balrog residing within the mines. While the others escape, Gandalf fends off the Balrog and casts it into a vast chasm, but the Balrog drags Gandalf down into the darkness with him. The devastated Fellowship reaches Lothlórien, ruled by the Elf-queen Galadriel, who privately informs Frodo that only he can complete the quest and that one of the Fellowship will try to take the Ring. \n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_vRu9flv1ebwLXCFXmX16jnic","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
