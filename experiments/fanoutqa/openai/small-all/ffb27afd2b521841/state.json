Byzantine emperors Constantine VIII and Basil II, reigning for 66 years in total (962\u20131028) and for 65 years in total (960\u20131025) respectively, are not included, because for part of those periods they reigned only nominally as junior co-emperors alongside senior emperors.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n## Monarchs of dependent or constituent states with verifiable reigns by exact date[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

Within each year-grouping, they appear in historical order. In a given year, there may have been a wide array of actual reign lengths based on days. Thus, this table does not present a precise ranking by length of reign. The list is limited to those that might reasonably be expected to lie within the range of those in the tables above, at minimum 56 years. The list is sorted alphabetically. ***Emphasised*** states were sovereign. Japanese legendary emperors, according to the ancient Japanese calendar, reigned for very long terms of 60\u201370 years each. The longest ruler of the legendary emperors, Emperor K\u014dan, was claimed to have reigned for about 101 years. These figures are not included in the table because they are regarded as inaccurate by modern scholars. For those, see Longevity myths.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| No. | Portrait\n | Name\n | State\n | Reign\n | Duration\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| From\n | To\n | (days)\n | (years, days)\n |\n| 1\n | ![](image) | Louis XIV | * ![](image)\u00a0France\n* ![](image)\u00a0Andorra\n | 14 May 1643 | 1 September 1715 | 26,407\n | 72\u00a0years, 110\u00a0days\n | [1] |\n| 2\n | ![](image) | Elizabeth II | * ![](image)\u00a0United Kingdom\n* ![](image)\u00a0Canada\n* ![](image)\u00a0Australia\n* ![](image)\u00a0New Zealand\n[a] | 6 February 1952 | 8 September 2022 | 25,782\n | 70\u00a0years, 214\u00a0days[b] | [2][3][4] |\n| 3\n | ![](image) | Rama IX(Bhumibol Adulyadej) | ![](image)\u00a0Thailand | 9 June 1946 | 13 October 2016 | 25,694\n | 70\u00a0years, 126\u00a0days\n | [5] |\n| 4\n | ![](image) | Johann II | ![](image)\u00a0Liechtenstein | 12 November 1858 | 11 February 1929 | 25,658\n | 70\u00a0years, 91\u00a0days\n | [6] |\n| 5\n | ![](image) | K\u02bcinich Janaab\u02bc Pakal I | Palenque (Mexico)\n | 27 July 615[c] | 29 August 683 | 24,870\n | 68\u00a0years, 33\u00a0days\n | [7][9] |\n| 6\n | ![](image) | Franz Joseph I | * ![](image)\u00a0Austrian Empire (1848\u20131867)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* ![](image)\u00a0Jamaica (sovereign 6 August 1962; 60\u00a0years, 33\u00a0days)\n\t* ![](image)\u00a0Bahamas (sovereign 10 July 1973; 49\u00a0years, 60\u00a0days)\n\t* ![](image)\u00a0Grenada (sovereign 7 February 1974; 48\u00a0years, 213\u00a0days)\n\t* ![](image)\u00a0Papua New Guinea (sovereign 16 September 1975; 46\u00a0years, 357\u00a0days)\n\t* ![](image)\u00a0Solomon Islands (sovereign 7 July 1978; 44\u00a0years, 63\u00a0days)\n\t* ![](image)\u00a0Tuvalu (sovereign 1 October 1978; 43\u00a0years, 342\u00a0days)\n\t* ![](image)\u00a0Saint Lucia (sovereign 22 February 1979; 43\u00a0years, 198\u00a0days)\n\t* ![](image)\u00a0Saint Vincent and the Grenadines (sovereign 27 October 1979; 42\u00a0years, 316\u00a0days)\n\t* ![](image)\u00a0Belize (sovereign 21 September 1981; 40\u00a0years, 352\u00a0days)\n\t* ![](image)\u00a0Antigua and Barbuda (sovereign 1 November 1981; 40\u00a0years, 311\u00a0days)\n\t* ![](image)\u00a0Saint Kitts and Nevis (sovereign 19 September 1983; 38\u00a0years, 354\u00a0days)\n2. **^** Length of reign applies to the independent states that have remained monarchies since her accession: Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| No. | Portrait\n | Name\n | State\n | Reign\n | Duration\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| From\n | To\n | (days)\n | (years, days)\n |\n| 1\n | ![](image) | Sobhuza II[p] | ![](image)\u00a0Swaziland (British protectorate until 1968)\n | 10 December 1899 | 21 August 1982 | 30,204\n | 82\u00a0years, 254\u00a0days\n | [38] |\n| 2\n | ![](image) | Bernhard VII | ![](image) Lippe (Holy Roman Empire)\n | 11 August 1429 | 2 April 1511 | 29,819\n | 81\u00a0years, 234\u00a0days\n | [39] |\n| 3\n |  | Udai Pratap Nath Shah Deo | Chotanagpur (British Raj)\n | 9 July 1869 | 21 September 1950 | 29,658\n | 81\u00a0years, 74\u00a0days\n | [40] |\n| 4\n | ![](image) | William IV | ![](image) Henneberg-Schleusingen (Holy Roman Empire)\n | 26 May 1480 | 24 January 1559 | 28,732\n | 78\u00a0years, 243\u00a0days\n | [39] |\n| 5\n |  | Karansinhji II Vajirajji | Lakhtar State [q] | 15 June 1846 | 8 August 1924 | 28,543\n | 78\u00a0years, 54\u00a0days\n | [41] |\n| 6\n | ![](image) | Maeda Tsunanori | ![](image) Kaga Domain (Japan)\n | 30 April 1645 | 6 May 1723 | 28,494\n | 78\u00a0years, 6\u00a0days\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"BBC \u2013 History \u2013 Historic Figures: Louis XIV (1638\u20131715)\". *www.bbc.co.uk*.

Byzantine emperors Constantine VIII and Basil II, reigning for 66 years in total (962\u20131028) and for 65 years in total (960\u20131025) respectively, are not included, because for part of those periods they reigned only nominally as junior co-emperors alongside senior emperors.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n## Monarchs of dependent or constituent states with verifiable reigns by exact date[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

Within each year-grouping, they appear in historical order. In a given year, there may have been a wide array of actual reign lengths based on days. Thus, this table does not present a precise ranking by length of reign. The list is limited to those that might reasonably be expected to lie within the range of those in the tables above, at minimum 56 years. The list is sorted alphabetically. ***Emphasised*** states were sovereign. Japanese legendary emperors, according to the ancient Japanese calendar, reigned for very long terms of 60\u201370 years each. The longest ruler of the legendary emperors, Emperor K\u014dan, was claimed to have reigned for about 101 years. These figures are not included in the table because they are regarded as inaccurate by modern scholars. For those, see Longevity myths.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| No. | Portrait\n | Name\n | State\n | Reign\n | Duration\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| From\n | To\n | (days)\n | (years, days)\n |\n| 1\n | ![](image) | Louis XIV | * ![](image)\u00a0France\n* ![](image)\u00a0Andorra\n | 14 May 1643 | 1 September 1715 | 26,407\n | 72\u00a0years, 110\u00a0days\n | [1] |\n| 2\n | ![](image) | Elizabeth II | * ![](image)\u00a0United Kingdom\n* ![](image)\u00a0Canada\n* ![](image)\u00a0Australia\n* ![](image)\u00a0New Zealand\n[a] | 6 February 1952 | 8 September 2022 | 25,782\n | 70\u00a0years, 214\u00a0days[b] | [2][3][4] |\n| 3\n | ![](image) | Rama IX(Bhumibol Adulyadej) | ![](image)\u00a0Thailand | 9 June 1946 | 13 October 2016 | 25,694\n | 70\u00a0years, 126\u00a0days\n | [5] |\n| 4\n | ![](image) | Johann II | ![](image)\u00a0Liechtenstein | 12 November 1858 | 11 February 1929 | 25,658\n | 70\u00a0years, 91\u00a0days\n | [6] |\n| 5\n | ![](image) | K\u02bcinich Janaab\u02bc Pakal I | Palenque (Mexico)\n | 27 July 615[c] | 29 August 683 | 24,870\n | 68\u00a0years, 33\u00a0days\n | [7][9] |\n| 6\n | ![](image) | Franz Joseph I | * ![](image)\u00a0Austrian Empire (1848\u20131867)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n51. **^** Sometimes her aunt Anne de La Tour d'Auvergne's death is given as June 1524 or 16 June 1524 (see for example her French wikipedia article), though sources seem to be laking for such specific dates and so she remains here.
