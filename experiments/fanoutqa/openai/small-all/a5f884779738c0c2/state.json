Nineteen moons are large enough to be round, several having subsurface oceans and one, Titan, having a considerable atmosphere.\nThe Moon is by size and mass the fifth largest natural satellite of the Solar System, categorizeable as one of its planetary-mass moons, making it a satellite planet under the geophysical definitions of the term.[18] It is smaller than Mercury and considerably larger than the largest dwarf planet of the Solar System, Pluto. While the minor-planet moon Charon of the Pluto-Charon system is larger relative to Pluto,[f][68] the Moon is the largest natural satellite of the Solar System relative to their primary planets.[g]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Moon is in geophysical terms a planetary-mass object or satellite planet. It has a mass that amounts to 1.2% of Earth's, and a diameter that is roughly one-quarter of Earth's or with 3,474\u00a0km (2,159\u00a0mi) about as wide as Australia.[17] Within the Solar System it is the most massive and largest satellite in relation to its parent planet, the fifth most massive and largest moon overall, and more massive and larger than all known dwarf planets.[18] Its surface gravity is about one sixth of Earth's, about half of that of Mars, and after Jupiter's moon Io the second highest among all Solar System moons. The body of the Moon is differentiated and terrestrial, with no significant hydrosphere, atmosphere, or magnetic field. It formed 4.51\u00a0billion years ago, not long after Earth's formation, out of the debris from a giant impact between Earth and a hypothesized Mars-sized body called Theia.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n16. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Lucey, Paul; Korotev, Randy L.; Gillis, Jeffrey J.; Taylor, Larry A.; Lawrence, David; Campbell, Bruce A.; Elphic, Rick; Feldman, Bill; Hood, Lon L.; Hunten, Donald; Mendillo, Michael; Noble, Sarah; Papike, James J.; Reedy, Robert C.; Lawson, Stefanie; Prettyman, Tom; Gasnault, Olivier; Maurice, Sylvestre (2006). \"Understanding the lunar surface and space-Moon interactions\". *Reviews in Mineralogy and Geochemistry*. **60** (1): 83\u2013219.

Schmitt next to a large Moon boulder\nThe topography of the Moon has been measured with laser altimetry and stereo image analysis.[112] Its most extensive topographic feature is the giant far-side South Pole\u2013Aitken basin, some 2,240\u00a0km (1,390\u00a0mi) in diameter, the largest crater on the Moon and the second-largest confirmed impact crater in the Solar System.[113][114] At 13\u00a0km (8.1\u00a0mi) deep, its floor is the lowest point on the surface of the Moon.[113][115] The highest elevations of the Moon's surface are located directly to the northeast, which might have been thickened by the oblique formation impact of the South Pole\u2013Aitken basin.[116] Other large impact basins such as Imbrium, Serenitatis, Crisium, Smythii, and Orientale possess regionally low elevations and elevated rims.[113] The far side of the lunar surface is on average about 1.9\u00a0km (1.2\u00a0mi) higher than that of the near side.[1]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Moon's diameter is about 3,500\u00a0km, more than a quarter of Earth's, with the face of the Moon comparable to the width of either Australia,[17] Europe or the US without Alaska.[69] The whole surface area of the Moon is about 38 million square kilometers, between the size of the Americas (North and South America) and Africa.\n\n\nThe Moon's mass is 1/81 of Earth's,[70] being the second densest among the planetary moons, and having the second highest surface gravity, after Io, at 0.1654\u00a0g and an escape velocity of 2.38\u00a0km/s (8600\u00a0km/h; 5300\u00a0mph).\n\n\n\n### Structure[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Internal structure of the Moon and Geology of the Moon\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Moon has been also a site of Earth observation, particularly culturally as in the photograph called *Earthrise*. The Earth appears in the Moon's sky with an apparent size of 1\u00b0 48\u2032 to 2\u00b0,[269] three to four times the size of the Moon or Sun in Earth's sky, or about the apparent width of two little fingers at an arm's length away.\n\n\n\n### Living on the Moon[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Lunar habitation\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n### Natural development[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Artist's depiction of the Moon as it might have appeared in Earth's sky after the Late Heavy Bombardment around 4 billion years ago, when its orbit was half as close to Earth and it appeared 2.8 times larger than today.[61]\nThe newly formed Moon settled into a much closer Earth orbit than it has today. Each body therefore appeared much larger in the sky of the other, eclipses were more frequent, and tidal effects were stronger.[61]\nDue to tidal acceleration, the Moon's orbit around Earth has become significantly larger, with a longer period.[62]\n\n\nFollowing formation, the Moon has cooled and most of its atmosphere has been stripped.[63] The lunar surface has since been shaped by large impact events and many small ones, forming a landscape featuring craters of all ages.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMoon| ![Full Moon in the darkness of the night sky.

Even satellites that initially pass within the Roche limit can reliably and predictably survive, by being partially stripped and then torqued onto wider, stable orbits.[58]\n\n\nOn 1 November 2023, scientists reported that, according to computer simulations, remnants of a protoplanet, named Theia, could be inside the Earth, left over from a collision with the Earth in ancient times, and afterwards becoming the Moon.[59][60]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n64. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Hiesinger, H.; Head, J.

The apparent size is nearly the same as that of the Sun, allowing it to cover the Sun almost completely during a total solar eclipse.

In the northern hemisphere it appears upside down compared to the view from the southern hemisphere.[186] Sometimes the \"horns\" of a crescent moon appear to be pointing more upwards than sideways. This phenomenon is called a wet moon and occurs more frequently in the tropics.[187]\n\n\nThe distance between the Moon and Earth varies from around 356,400\u00a0km (221,500\u00a0mi) (perigee) to 406,700\u00a0km (252,700\u00a0mi) (apogee), making the Moon's apparent size fluctuate. On average the Moon's angular diameter is about 0.52\u00b0, roughly the same apparent size as the Sun (see \u00a7\u00a0Eclipses). In addition, a purely psychological effect, known as the Moon illusion, makes the Moon appear larger when close to the horizon.[188]\n\n\nDespite the Moon's tidal locking, the effect of libration makes about 59% of the Moon's surface visible from Earth over the course of one month.[168][70]\n\n\n\n### Rotation[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n118. **^** Watters, Thomas R.; Weber, Renee C.; Collins, Geoffrey C.; Howley, Ian J.; Schmerr, Nicholas C.; Johnson, Catherine L.

It has an angular diameter of between 8' (rising) and 12' (overhead). Due to its close orbit, it would look smaller when the observer is further away from the Martian equator and is below the horizon and thus not visible from Mars's polar ice caps. Deimos looks more like a bright star or planet for an observer on Mars, only slightly bigger than Venus looks from Earth; it has an angular diameter of about 2'. The Sun's angular diameter as seen from Mars, by contrast, is about 21'. Thus there are no total solar eclipses on Mars, as the moons are far too small to completely cover the Sun. On the other hand, total lunar eclipses of Phobos happen almost every night.[25]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n6. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Close Inspection for Phobos\".

Ares, the god of war, was known to the Romans as Mars.\n\n\nCompared to the Earth's Moon, the moons Phobos and Deimos are small.

Phobos orbits closer to Mars, with a semi-major axis of 9,377\u00a0km (5,827\u00a0mi) and an orbital period of 7.66 hours; while Deimos orbits farther with a semi-major axis of 23,460\u00a0km (14,580\u00a0mi) and an orbital period of 30.35 hours.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n24. **^** Sheppard, Scott S.; Jewitt, David; Kleyna, Jan (November 2004). \"A Survey for Outer Satellites of Mars: Limits to Completeness\". *The Astronomical Journal*. **128** (5): 2542\u20132546. arXiv:astro-ph/0409522.

The inner part of the ring formed a large moon. Gravitational interactions between this moon and the outer ring formed Phobos and Deimos. Later, the large moon crashed into Mars, but the two small moons remained in orbit. This theory agrees with the fine-grained surface of the moons and their high porosity. The outer disk would create fine-grained material.[40][41] Simulations suggest the object colliding with Mars had to be within the size range of Ceres and Vesta because a larger impact would have created a more massive disc and moons that would have prevented the survival of tiny moons like Phobos and Deimos.[42]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nJAXA plans to launch Martian Moons eXploration (MMX) mission in 2024 to bring back the first samples from Phobos.[53][54] The spacecraft will enter orbit around Mars, then transfer to Phobos,[55] and land once or twice and gather sand-like regolith particles using a simple pneumatic system.[56] The lander mission aims to retrieve a minimum 10\u00a0g (0.35\u00a0oz) of samples.[57][58] The spacecraft will then take off from Phobos and make several flybys of the smaller moon Deimos before sending the Return Module back to Earth, arriving in July 2029.[55][53]\n\n\n\n## Gallery[edit]\n\n\n* ![Phobos, with Stickney Crater on the right (2003).](image)\n\nPhobos, with Stickney Crater on the right (2003).\n* ![Phobos (1998).[59]](image)\n\nPhobos (1998).[59]\n* ![Comparison - Phobos (top) and Deimos (bottom) (2005).](image)\n\nComparison - Phobos (top) and Deimos (bottom) (2005).\n\n\n![](image)Orbits of moons and spacecraft orbiting Mars.[60]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Andrews, Robin George (25 July 2020). \"Why the 'Super Weird' Moons of Mars Fascinate Scientists - What's the big deal about little Phobos and tinier Deimos?\". *The New York Times*.

At some point in the future, when it falls within the Roche limit, Phobos will be broken up by these tidal forces and either crash into Mars or form a ring.[26][27] Several strings of craters on the Martian surface, inclined further from the equator the older they are, suggest that there may have been other small moons that suffered the fate expected of Phobos, and that the Martian crust as a whole shifted between these events.[28] Deimos, on the other hand, is far enough away that its orbit is being slowly boosted instead,[29] akin to Earth's Moon.\n\n\n\n\n### Orbital details[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* List of missions to the moons of Mars\n* Mars trojan\u00a0\u2013 Celestial bodies that share the orbit of Mars\n* Satellites of Mars\n* Transit of Deimos from Mars\u00a0\u2013 Transit of a Moon of Mars\n* Transit of Phobos from Mars\u00a0\u2013 Transit of a Moon from Mars\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^**  Label refers to the Roman numeral attributed to each moon in order of their discovery.[30]\n2. **^**  Orbital inclinations are given to Mars's equator.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)The telescope used by Asaph Hall in the discovery of the Martian moons\nAsaph Hall discovered Deimos on 12 August 1877 at about 07:48 UTC and Phobos on 18 August 1877, at the US Naval Observatory (the Old Naval Observatory in Foggy Bottom) in Washington, D.C., at about 09:14 GMT (contemporary sources, using the pre-1925 astronomical convention that began the day at noon,[15] give the time of discovery as 11 August 14:40 and 17 August 16:06 Washington mean time respectively).[16][17][18] At the time, he was deliberately searching for Martian moons.

The spectra are distinct from those of all classes of chondrite meteorites, again pointing away from an asteroidal origin.[38] Both sets of findings support an origin of Phobos from material ejected by an impact on Mars that reaccreted in Martian orbit,[39] similar to the prevailing theory for the origin of Earth's moon.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe origin of the Martian moons is still controversial.[31] Phobos and Deimos both have much in common with carbonaceous C-type asteroids, with spectra, albedo, and density very similar to those of C- or D-type asteroids.[32] Based on their similarity, one hypothesis is that both moons may be captured main-belt asteroids.[6][33] Both moons have very circular orbits which lie almost exactly in Mars's equatorial plane, and hence a capture origin requires a mechanism for circularizing the initially highly eccentric orbit, and adjusting its inclination into the equatorial plane, most probably by a combination of atmospheric drag and tidal forces,[34] although it is not clear that sufficient time is available for this to occur for Deimos.[31] Capture also requires dissipation of energy. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMost recently, Amirhossein Bagheri and his colleagues from ETH Zurich and US Naval Observatory, proposed a new hypothesis on the origin of the moons. By analyzing the seismic and orbital data from Mars InSight Mission and other missions, they proposed that the moons are born from the disruption of a common parent body around 1 to 2.7 billion years ago. The common progenitor of Phobos and Deimos was most probably hit by another object and shattered to form Phobos and Deimos.[43] But a recent paper suggests that it seems unlikely that Phobos and Deimos are split directly from a single ancestral moon.[44] They use N-body simulations to show that the single ancestral moon scenario should result in an impact between the two moons, leading to a debris ring in 104 years.\n\n\n\n\n## Exploration[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Phobos (moon) \u00a7\u00a0Exploration, and Deimos (moon) \u00a7\u00a0Exploration\n\n### Past attempts and proposals[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe current atmosphere of Mars is too thin to capture a Phobos-sized object by atmospheric braking.[31] Geoffrey Landis has pointed out that the capture could have occurred if the original body was a binary asteroid that separated under tidal forces.[33]\n\n\nPhobos could be a second-generation Solar System object that coalesced in orbit after Mars formed, rather than forming concurrently out of the same birth cloud as Mars.[35]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n43. **^** Bagheri, Amirhossein; Khan, Amir; Efroimsky, Michael; Kruglyakov, Mikhail; Giardini, Domenico (22 February 2021). \"Dynamical evidence for Phobos and Deimos as remnants of a disrupted common progenitor\". *Nature Astronomy*. **5** (6): 539\u2013543.
