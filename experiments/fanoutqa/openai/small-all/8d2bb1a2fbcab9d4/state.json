For the first time, Jeff Bezos was listed as the top billionaire due to Amazon's rising stock price that resulted in one person's biggest one-year gain in wealth ($35 billion) since *Forbes* started tracking in 1987.[15] The U.S. had the most billionaires in the world, with 585, while China was catching up with 476 when including Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan; it had 372 when excluding those three places.[15] Forbes excluded Al-Walid bin Talal and all other Saudi billionaires due to the absence of accurate wealth estimations as a result of the 2017\u201319 Saudi Arabian purge.[16]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAnnual ranking of the World's billionaires by Forbes magazine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*The World's Billionaires*| List of the world's billionaires, ranked in order of net worth |\n| ![](image)The net worth of the world's billionaires increased from less than US$1 trillion in 2000 to over $7 trillion in 2015.\n |\n| Publication details |\n| Publisher | * Whale Media Investments\n* Forbes family\n |\n| Publication | *Forbes* |\n| First published | March 1987[1] |\n| Latest publication | April 4, 2023 |\n| Current list details (2023)[2] |\n| Wealthiest | Bernard Arnault |\n| Net worth (1st) | ![Decrease](image)\u00a0US$211\u00a0billion |\n| Number of billionaires | ![Decrease](image)\u00a02,640 (from 2668) |\n| Total list net worth value | ![Decrease](image)\u00a0US$12.2\u00a0trillion (from US$12.7 trillion) |\n| Number of women | ![Increase](image)\u00a0337 |\n| Number of men | ![Increase](image)\u00a02310 |\n| New members to the list | ![Decrease](image)\u00a0150 |\n| *Forbes*: The World's Billionaires website |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n16. **^** Dolan, Kerry A. \"Why No Saudi Arabians Made The Forbes Billionaires List This Year\". *Forbes*.

Over half of the list is less wealthy compared to the previous year, including Elon Musk, who fell from No. 1 to No. 2.[2] The list also marks for the first time a French citizen was in the top position as well as a non-American for the first time since 2013 when the Mexican Carlos Slim Helu was the world's richest person. The list, like in 2022, counted 15 under 30 billionaires with the richest of them being Red Bull heir Mark Mateschitz with a net worth of $34.7 billion. The youngest of the lot were Clemente Del Vecchio, heir to the Luxottica fortune shared with his six siblings and stepmother, and Kim Jung-yang, whose fortune lies in Japanese-South Korean gaming giant Nexon, both under-20s.[10]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn the 30th anniversary of the *Forbes* list of the world's billionaires, for the fourth year in a row, Bill Gates was named the richest man in the world.[5] In 2017, there was a record of 2,043 people on the list, which is the first time over 2,000 people were listed. This included 195 newcomers of whom 76 were from China and 25 from the U.S.; there were 56 people under 40 and it had a record of 227 women.[17] The number of billionaires increased 13% to 2,043 from 1,810 in 2016; this was the biggest change in over 30 years of tracking billionaires globally.[5] Added together, the total net worth for 2017's billionaires was US$7.67\u00a0trillion, up from US$7.1\u00a0trillion in 2015.[5][18] This was the first time after 12 years that Carlos Slim was not within the top five. The U.S. had the most billionaires in the world, with a record of 565. China had 319 (not including Hong Kong, Taiwan or Macau), Germany had 114, and India had the fourth most with 101; India reached over 100 billionaires for its first time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBill Gates was named the richest man in the world by *Forbes*' annual list of the world's billionaires.

Larry Ellison, the founder of Oracle, rounded off the top five. Christy Walton was the highest-ranking female at number eight. America's Evan Spiegel, co-founder of photo messaging app Snapchat, became the youngest billionaire this year at age 24. At age 99, David Rockefeller maintained his position as the oldest billionaire included in the list.[27] Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, rose to number 16 with $33.4 billion.

2013[edit]\n\n\nMain article: The World's Billionaires 2013\n\nCarlos Slim topped the 2013 billionaire list, marking his fourth consecutive year at the top. Gates remained in second, while Amancio Ortega moved up to third. Ortega's gain of $19.5 billion was the largest of anyone on the list.[31] Warren Buffett failed to make the top three for the first time since 2000, placing fourth. Diesel founder Renzo Rosso was among the top newcomers, debuting with an estimate net worth of $3 billion.[32]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 8 ![Steady](image) | Eike Batista | $30.0\u00a0billion\u00a0![Increase](image) | 53 | ![](image)\u00a0Brazil | EBX Group |\n| 9 ![Decrease](image) | Mukesh Ambani | $27.0\u00a0billion ![Decrease](image) | 54 | ![](image)\u00a0India | Reliance Industries |\n| 10 ![Increase](image) | Christy Walton & family | $26.5\u00a0billion\u00a0![Increase](image) | 62 | ![](image)\u00a0United States | Walmart |\n\n\n### 2010[edit]\n\n\nMain article: The World's Billionaires 2010\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| **Sources:** *Forbes*.[18][67][66][68] |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Biography portal\n* ![icon](image)Economics portal\n* ![](image)World portal\n\n\n* Bloomberg Billionaires Index\n* List of centibillionaires\n* List of cities by number of billionaires\n* List of countries by number of billionaires\n* List of wealthiest animals\n* List of wealthiest families\n* List of wealthiest religious organizations\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Specific[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* 2000\u20132010 Top 10s: Rogers, Simon (11 March 2010). \"Forbes rich list: ten years of top tens\". *The Guardian*.\n* 2011 Top 10: \"The World's Billionaires 2011\". *Forbes*.\n* 2012 Top 10: \"Forbes rich list 2012: top 50\". *The Telegraph*. 8 March 2012.
