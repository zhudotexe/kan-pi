Cameron's debut was the 1978 science fiction short *Xenogenesis*, which he directed, wrote and produced.[1][2] In his early career, he did various technical jobs such as special visual effects producer, set dresser assistant, matte artist, and photographer. His feature directorial debut was the 1982 release *Piranha II: The Spawning*.[2][3] The next film he directed was the science fiction action thriller *The Terminator* (1984) which starred Arnold Schwarzenegger as the titular cyborg assassin, and was Cameron's breakthrough feature.[4][5][6] In 1986, he directed and wrote the science fiction action sequel *Aliens* starring Sigourney Weaver.[7] He followed this by directing another science fiction film *The Abyss* (1989). In 1991, Cameron directed the sequel to *The Terminator*, *Terminator 2: Judgment Day* (with Schwarzenegger reprising his role),[8] and also executive produced the action crime film *Point Break*. Three years later he directed a third Schwarzenegger-starring action film *True Lies* (1994).[9]\n\n\nIn 1997, Cameron directed, wrote, and produced the epic romantic disaster film *Titanic* which grossed over $1.8 billion[10][a] at the worldwide box-office and became the highest grossing of all time.[b] He received the Academy Award for Best Director, the Academy Award for Best Film Editing, and shared the Academy Award for Best Picture with the other producers. It had a total of 14 Oscar nominations (tying the record set by the 1950 drama *All About Eve*) and won 11 (tying the record set by the 1959 epic historical drama *Ben-Hur*).[15] Cameron also won the Golden Globe Award for Best Director and shared the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Drama with the other producers.[16] He followed this by directing, and producing two underwater documentaries: *Ghosts of the Abyss* (2003), and *Aliens of the Deep* (2005). He returned to directing features in 2009 with the 3D science fiction film *Avatar*.
