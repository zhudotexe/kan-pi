In both innings, the Rangers were one strike away from their first World Series championship. The Cardinals won the game in the 11th inning on a walk-off home run by David Freese, who was named World Series MVP. The Series was also known for the blowout Game 3, in which Cardinals player Albert Pujols hit three home runs, a World Series feat previously accomplished only by Reggie Jackson and Babe Ruth, and subsequently by Pablo Sandoval in 2012. In 2020, ESPN named the 2011 World Series the fifth greatest of all-time.[4]\n\n\nThe Series began on October 19, earlier than the previous season, so that no games would be played in November.[5] The Cardinals enjoyed home-field advantage for the series because the NL won the 2011 All-Star Game 5–1 on July 12.[6] The 2011 World Series was the first World Series to go all seven games since the 2002 Series.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the postseason, the Rangers were the #2 seed in the AL. They defeated the wild-card Tampa Bay Rays in four games in the American League Division Series. They then defeated the third-seeded Detroit Tigers in six games in the American League Championship Series to reach their second consecutive appearance in the World Series.\n\n\nThe Rangers lost home-field advantage in the World Series as a result of the AL team, managed by Rangers manager Ron Washington, losing the 2011 All-Star Game, when Ranger ace C. J. Wilson surrendered the game-winning three-run homer to Prince Fielder.[6]\n\n\n\n![](image)Cardinals third baseman David Freese experienced a torrid hitting streak in the postseason, being named NLCS MVP in 2011.\n### St. Louis Cardinals[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2011 St. Louis Cardinals season\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2011 MLB Postseason\n\nThe Rangers were appearing in their second consecutive World Series; they lost the 2010 Series to the San Francisco Giants in five games. They were the first American League team to play in consecutive World Series since the New York Yankees did it from 1998 to 2001.[7] They earned their postseason berth by winning the American League West division, then defeated the Tampa Bay Rays in the American League Division Series and the Detroit Tigers in the American League Championship Series to earn their World Series berth.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nSt. Louis Cardinals 2011 World Series champions\n |\n| --- |\n| 3 Ryan Theriot\n4 Yadier Molina\n5 Albert Pujols\n7 Matt Holliday\n8 Nick Punto\n12 Lance Berkman\n13 Gerald Laird\n15 Rafael Furcal\n19 Jon Jay\n21 Allen Craig\n22 Edwin Jackson\n23 David Freese (NLCS & World Series MVP)\n26 Kyle Lohse\n28 Octavio Dotel\n29 Chris Carpenter\n30 Jason Motte\n33 Daniel Descalso\n34 Marc Rzepczynski\n35 Jake Westbrook\n41 Mitchell Boggs\n46 Kyle McClellan\n53 Arthur Rhodes\n54 Jaime García\n55 Skip Schumaker\n56 Adron Chambers\n59 Fernando Salas\n62 Lance Lynn\n |\n| Manager 10 Tony La Russa\nBench Coach 49 Joe Pettini\n1st Base Coach 39 Dave McKay\n3rd Base Coach 11 José Oquendo\nHitting Coach 25 Mark McGwire\nPitching Coach 18 Dave Duncan\nBullpen Coach 36 Derek Lilliquist\nBullpen Catcher 58 Jeff Murphy\n |\n| Regular season\nNational League Division Series\nNational League Championship Series\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n2011 World Series **(4–3): St. Louis Cardinals (N.L.)** over Texas Rangers (A.L.)\n\n\n\n\n\n \n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **St. Louis Cardinals** | 5 | 2 | 1 | 7 | 5 | 6 | 4 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 38 | 56 | 6\n |\n| Texas Rangers | 4 | 1 | 1 | 4 | 6 | 4 | 4 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 30 | 60 | 8\n |\n| **Total attendance:** 342,878   **Average attendance:** 48,983**Winning player's share:** $323,169.98   **Losing player's share:** $251,515.76[46] |\n\n\n## Broadcasting[edit]\n\n\n### Television[edit]\n\n\nThe series was televised in the United States and Canada by Fox.

The first was the 1986 World Series, in which the New York Mets rallied from a 5–3 deficit in the bottom of the 10th inning of Game 6 to win the game and, later, the decisive Game 7.[55][56]\n\n\nThis was the third and final World Series title for Cardinals manager Tony La Russa, who initially announced his retirement on October 31, 2011, after 33 seasons as a major league manager.[57] La Russa later came out of retirement and served as manager of the Chicago White Sox in 2021 and 2022. La Russa had previously led the Cardinals (2006) and Oakland Athletics (1989) to World Series championships. Former Cardinals catcher Mike Matheny, who played for the 2004 Cardinals that lost the World Series, was hired to replace him.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Busch Stadium scoreboard after Game 7.Chris Carpenter was relieved after pitching six innings and was credited with the win. The Cardinals used four relievers to hold Texas scoreless over the final three innings. The final out was recorded when Jason Motte got David Murphy to fly out to Cardinal left fielder Allen Craig as Busch Stadium went into a frenzy.[42][43]\n\n\nDavid Freese became the sixth player in history to earn League Championship Series and World Series MVP awards in the same postseason.[44]\n\n\n\nThe Rangers set a Series record by issuing 41 walks, breaking the previous record held by the Florida Marlins when winning the 1997 World Series after issuing 40.[45]\n\n![](image)Cardinals players celebrate after winning their franchise's 11th World Series title.The Cardinals became the first wild card team to win the World Series since the Boston Red Sox won the 2004 World Series (coincidentally, against the Cardinals).\n\n\n## Composite Line Score[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n44. **^** DiComo, Anthony (October 29, 2011). \"Freese caps stellar playoffs with Series MVP\". *MLB.com*.

Heading into 2010, their 50th season as a franchise (counting its time as the **Washington Senators**), the team was the only one in Major League Baseball never to win a postseason series,[9] and was among three teams (along with the Seattle Mariners and the Washington Nationals) never to appear in the World Series. That season, however, the Rangers won their first postseason series and made their first appearance in the World Series, only to lose to the San Francisco Giants in five games.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| World Series | * 1996\n* 1998\n* 2000\n* 2001\n* 2002\n* 2003\n* 2004\n* 2005\n* 2006\n* 2007\n* 2008\n* 2009\n* 2010\n* 2011\n* 2012\n* 2013\n* 2014\n* 2015\n* 2016\n* 2017\n* 2018\n* 2019\n* 2020\n* 2021\n* 2022\n* 2022\n* 2023\n* 2024\n* 2025\n* 2026\n* 2027\n* 2028\n |\n| AL Championship Series | * 1997\n* 1999\n* 2001\n* 2002\n* 2003\n* 2004\n* 2005\n* 2006\n* 2007\n* 2009\n* 2011\n* 2013\n* 2015\n* 2017\n* 2019\n* 2021\n* 2023\n |\n| NL Championship Series | * 1996\n* 1998\n* 2000\n* 2001\n* 2002\n* 2003\n* 2004\n* 2005\n* 2006\n* 2008\n* 2010\n* 2012\n* 2014\n* 2016\n* 2018\n* 2020\n* 2022\n |\n| AL Division Series | * 1996\n* 1997\n* 1998\n* 1999\n* 2000\n* 2001\n* 2002\n* 2003\n* 2004\n* 2005\n* 2006\n* 2015\n* 2017\n* 2019\n* 2021\n* 2023\n |\n| NL Division Series | * 1996\n* 1998\n* 2000\n* 2001\n* 2002\n* 2003\n* 2004\n* 2005\n* 2006\n* 2014\n* 2016\n* 2018\n* 2020\n* 2022\n |\n| All-Star Game | * 1997\n* 1999\n* 2001\n* 2002\n* 2003\n* 2004\n* 2005\n* 2006\n* 2007\n* 2008\n* 2009\n* 2010\n* 2011\n* 2012\n* 2013\n* 2014\n* 2015\n* 2016\n* 2017\n* 2018\n* 2019\n* ~~2020~~\n* 2021\n* 2022\n* 2023\n* 2024\n* 2025\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Cardinals were appearing in their 18th World Series, and third in eight years.[8] They lost to the Boston Red Sox in 2004, but won in 2006 against the Detroit Tigers. The Cardinals earned their postseason berth by winning the National League Wild Card on the last day of the regular season, then defeated the Philadelphia Phillies in the National League Division Series and the Milwaukee Brewers in the National League Championship Series to earn their World Series berth.\n\n\nThis Series was only the second time the Rangers and the Cardinals played each other; they met in regular-season interleague play in 2004, when the Cardinals won two of a three-game series in Texas.[9] This was the first World Series assignment for umpires Greg Gibson and Ron Kulpa. Each of the other umpires had previously worked one World Series.[10]\n\n\nThe Cardinals were supported by fans brandishing Rally Squirrel memorabilia that alluded to a squirrel that ran across the field during a playoff game.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n51. **^** \"ESPN's Baseball Tonight & ESPN Radio All Over The 107th Fall Classic\".
