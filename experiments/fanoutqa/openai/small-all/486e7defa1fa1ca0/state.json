In addition to maintaining its pedigree registry, this kennel club also promotes and sanctions events for purebred dogs, including the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show, an annual event which predates the official forming of the AKC, the National Dog Show and the AKC National Championship. The AKC is a non-member partner with the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale.[1] The AKC recognizes 200 dog breeds, as of 2022.[update]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nIn the early 1800s, the English became concerned with the beauty of dogs as well as their function.[2] This fad spread to North America, and in 1877, the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show began.[2] Soon after, the need for a regulating body became obvious. The National American Kennel Club, which had been founded in 1876, began to publish and make publicly available its studbook in 1879.[2] This organization, however, had more vested interest in field trials than in conformation shows, and eventually changed its name to the National Field Trial Association and stopped hosting conformation shows completely.[2]\n\n\n\nIn 1884, a group of 13 breed clubs, 10 American clubs and three Canadian clubs founded the American Kennel Club.[2] These 13 clubs pledged \"to do everything to advance the study, breeding, exhibiting, running and maintenance of purity of thoroughbred dogs.\"[3] The AKC differed from The Kennel Club in that individuals could not directly join the AKC; they became members of smaller, individual breed clubs, which were themselves members of the AKC.[2] When arguments began to develop between the American and Canadian breed clubs in 1886, the Canadian clubs pulled out from the organization and established their own kennel club two years later, the Canadian Kennel Club.[2]\n\n\nIn 1894, the American Kennel Club began to refuse to allow Canadian dogs without an American pedigree to participate in its shows, following the prevailing trends in American purebred cattle organizations.[2] In 1906, the U.S. Department of Agriculture ruled that any dogs imported to America who were not registered with the AKC would have to pay a duty charge; this was later changed in 1911, allowing any dog registered with a kennel club in its home country duty-free entry into the country.[2] Soon after the AKC, CKC, and KC produced agreements that made any dog eligible to be registered with the club in its home country, eligible for registration in the remaining two clubs as well.[2] In 1909, the group moved to New York and became incorporated.[2]\n\n\nOn July 1, 2012, the AKC began to recognize certain titles issued by the North American Flyball Association. These titles are Flyball Champion (FDCh), Flyball Master (FM), and the ONYX title.[4]\n\n\n\n## Registration[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rottweiler breed competition at the Reliant Arena American Kennel Club World Series Dog Show July 23, 2006.\nThe AKC is the largest registry of purebred dogs in the U.S. and is the only not-for profit registry, as well as the most well-known and the most influential.[3] For a purebred dog to be registered with the AKC, the dog's parents must be registered with the AKC as the same breed, and the litter in which the dog is born must be registered with the AKC. If the dog's parents are not registered with the AKC or the litter is not registered, an exception may be made if the AKC determines, through special registry research, that the dog is eligible for AKC registration. Once a determination of eligibility is met, either by litter application or registry research, the dog can be registered as purebred by the AKC.[5] Registration indicates only that the dog's parents were registered as one recognized breed; it does not necessarily indicate that the dog comes from healthy or show-quality bloodlines, nor is registration necessarily a reflection on the quality of the breeder or how the puppy was raised.[6][7]\n\n\n\n### Foundation Stock Service[edit]\n\n\nThe AKC's Foundation Stock Service is an optional breed registry service the club provides for new purebred dog breeds that have been introduced to the US and are yet to be recognized by the AKC.[8]\n\n\n\n## Activities[edit]\n\n\n![A short-legged, long-bodied, tan dog jumping off the end of a see-saw.](image)A Pembroke Welsh Corgi participating in dog agility. This particular dog is a multi-titled champion of agility, herding, and obedience.\n### Competition[edit]\n\n\nThe AKC sanctions events in which dogs and handlers can compete.\n\n\n\nConformation shows\nIn AKC conformation shows dogs compete in different classes based on breed and sex, with breeds divided into hound, terrier, working, herding, sporting, non-sporting, toy and miscellaneous groups.[9] The AKC's premier conformation shows are the Westminster Dog Show and the AKC National Championship.[10]\n\n\n\nDog agility\nThe AKC organises dog agility competitions open to all AKC registered dogs over 12-months age.[11]\n\n\n\nObedience trials\nThe AKC organises obedience trials open to all AKC registered dogs over 6-months age.[12]\n\n\n\nPerformance dog sports\nThe AKC organises a variety of field competitions they term performance dog sports, including herding and farm dog trials, scent work trials, earthdog trials, lure coursing trials and field trials for Bassets, Beagles, coonhounds, Dachshunds, pointing dogs, retrievers and spaniels.[13]\n\n\n\n### Other programs[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Canine Good Citizen\n\nThe AKC also offers the Canine Good Citizen program. This program tests dogs of any breed (including mixed breed) or type, registered or not, for basic behavior and temperament suitable for appearing in public and living at home.\n\n\nAnother AKC affiliate is AKC Reunite,[14] formerly AKC Companion Animal Recovery (AKC CAR), founded in 1995, which is North America's largest not-for-profit pet ID and recovery service.\n\n\nAnother AKC affiliate is the AKC Humane Fund,[15] which supports breed rescue activities, assists shelters that permit domestic violence victims to bring their pets and educates dog lovers about responsible dog ownership.\n\n\nThe AKC also provides titles for therapy dogs, after the dogs have been certified by AKC recognized therapy dog organizations and have performed a required number of visits.[16]\n\n\n\n## Criticism and controversy[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This article's \"criticism\" or \"controversy\" section **may compromise the article's neutrality**. Please help rewrite or integrate negative information to other sections through discussion on the talk page. *(June 2022)*\n |\n\n\n### Genetics[edit]\n\n\nThe AKC has been criticized for the prevalence of genetic disorders in their dogs. As many as 25% of purebred dogs registered by the AKC has at least one hereditary genetic problem.[3] These problems cost breeders and owners almost $1 billion in vet bills and lost revenues from stillborn pups.[3] Some breed clubs, such as the U.S. Border Collie Club, resisted applying for AKC breed acceptance due to fears that doing so would be detrimental to the genetics of the breed they represent.[3][17]\n\n\nThese genetic issues have resulted in the emergence of \"puppy lemon laws\" in several U.S. states.[3] These laws protect dog owners from genetic diseases that their breeder may have neglected to inform them of, allowing them to get a refund for the cost of the puppy or to force the breeder to pay their vet bills.[3]\n\n\n\n### Health[edit]\n\n\nThe AKC supports some canine health research and has run advertising campaigns implying that the AKC is committed to healthy dogs, but the AKC's role in furthering dog health is controversial. Temple Grandin maintains that the AKC's standards only regulate physical appearance, not emotional or behavioral health.[18] The AKC itself states that \"There is a widely held belief that 'AKC' or 'AKC papers' guarantee the quality of a dog. This is not the case. AKC is a registry body. A registration certificate\u00a0... in no way indicates the quality or state of health of the dog.\"[19]\n\n\nThe AKC has no health standards for breeding; the only breeding restriction is age (a dog can be no younger than eight months).[20] Though the majority of the 170 breed-specific parent clubs have a health committee devoted to their breed's specific concerns, the AKC prohibits clubs from imposing stricter regulations since the AKC Rules Applying to Registration and Discipline[20] apply to all breed clubs and do not provide an option for breed clubs to extend or override them. Thus, an AKC breed club cannot require a higher breeding age, hip dysplasia ratings, genetic tests for heritable diseases, or any other restrictions. Parent clubs have the power to define the looks of the breed, or the breed standard, and may also restrict participation in non-regular events or classes such as futurities or maturities to only those dogs meeting their defined criteria. These non-regular events can require health testing, DNA sampling, instinct/ability testing, and other outlined requirements as established by the hosting club.\n\n\nIn summary, attention to health among breeders is voluntary and not mandated. By contrast, many dog clubs outside the U.S. do require health tests of breeding dogs. The German Shepherd Club of Germany,[21] for example, requires hip and elbow X-rays in addition to other tests before a dog can be bred.[22] Such breeding restrictions are not allowed in AKC member clubs.[20] As a result, some U.S. breeders have established parallel registries or health databases outside of the AKC; for example, the Berner Garde[23] established such a database in 1995 after genetic diseases reduced the average lifespan of a Bernese Mountain Dog to seven years. By comparison, the Swiss Bernese Mountain Dog Club introduced mandatory hip X-rays in 1971.[24]\n\n\nFor these, and other reasons, a small number of breed clubs have not yet joined the AKC so they can maintain stringent health standards, but, in general, the breeders' desire to show their dogs at AKC shows such as the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show has won out over these concerns. Concern surrounding the AKC's connections to low-quality breeders has resulted in some dog owners seeking to distance themselves from the organization. In October 2012, Hailey Parker, a longtime Coton de Tulear breeder, filed a lawsuit (that was settled) against the AKC and cited the AKC's connections with high-volume breeders among the reasons.[25] The Coton's \"reputation and business model is based on a disassociation from 'puppy mills' and similar commercial breeding operations\", according to the complaint.\n\n\nThe club has also been criticized for courting large scale commercial breeders[26][27] and for lax enforcement of breeding regulations. The AKC employs just nine field inspectors[25] and critics argue that its inspections are ineffective. For example, the owner of a Montana Alaskan Malamute kennel approved by AKC inspectors in 2008 and 2009 was sentenced to five years in prison for animal cruelty in operating that kennel.[25] Similarly, an AKC inspector found a North Carolina kennel \"in compliance with AKC's Care Conditions Policy\" three months before county officers raided the facility and found the dogs in \"poor\" condition, suffering from illnesses, injuries and living in \"unhealthy conditions\", according to court documents. A veterinarian told the court that the rescued dogs had ailments that ranged \"from serious to severe\" and that \"most of the injuries appeared to be chronic, having been in existence for a substantial period of time.\"[25]\n\n\nSimilarly, the Humane Society of the United States criticized the AKC for not taking a stand against puppy mills.[28] According to the Humane Society's report, \"over the past five years, AKC has opposed more than 80 different state bills and local ordinances designed to provide stronger protections for dogs in puppy mills\".[29]\n\n\nThe AKC does support several health research initiatives. The AKC Canine Health Foundation funded research that led to the mapping of the canine genome (DNA sequence) with grants totaling more than $2,000,000. Sequencing of the dog genome began in June 2003, funded in large part by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) and finished the completed sequence of the entire dog genome at MIT's Broad Institute in 2005.[30] Because people inherit many of the same diseases as dogs, humans can also benefit from health research funded for dogs.\n\n\nThe Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) and the AKC Canine Health Foundation have established the Canine Health Information Center (CHIC) to encourage health testing by breeders and provide breeders and researchers with information to improve breeding programs. More than 135 different breeds have specific health testing prerequisites required by their parent breed club.[31]\n\n\n\n### Opposition by breed clubs[edit]\n\n\n* **Cavalier King Charles Spaniel:** The Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Club voted to reject AKC recognition in May 2000 due to the incompatibility of the breed club's no-sales-to-pet-stores rule, while the AKC required such sales.[3] The breed club had such a rule to aid in the genetic health of the breed.[3][32]\n* **Jack Russell Terrier:** In the 1990s, some breeders of Jack Russell Terriers wanted to be included in the AKC, but the Jack Russell Terrier Club of America (JRTCA) opposed the idea on the grounds that the working abilities of the JRT would be compromised by turning it into a show dog with an association dedicated to providing awards and championship status to individual dogs based solely on their conformation. The AKC did accept the JRT into the registry but under the new name Parson Russell Terrier to distinguish the AKC dogs from the JRT working dogs.[33][*self-published source?*]\n\n\n### Lobbying[edit]\n\n\nThe AKC has lobbied dog-related bills. They are opposed to tightening of laws regarding licensing of trainers.[34][35]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of dog breeds\n* List of kennel clubs\n* United Kennel Club\n* Dogs in the United States\n* Dogs portal\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Members & Partners\". *www.fci.be*.

It states: \"Great Britain and France are the ground zero of dog fancying, with 57 registered breeds each. Germany is not far behind, with 47 breeds.

'Bohemian Terrier' or 'Czech Terrier') is a small terrier type dog originating in Czechoslovakia.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nThe Cesky Terrier was created by a Czech breeder, Franti\u0161ek Hor\u00e1k, in 1948, as a cross between a Sealyham Terrier and a Scottish Terrier, to create a terrier suitable for hunting in the forests of Bohemia. Although not a trained scientist, Hor\u00e1k worked for many years as a research assistant at the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences and used knowledge gained there in his dog breeding. Czechoslovakia was ruled by a communist regime at the time; when Hor\u00e1k's dogs became more popular around the world, he began to receive a large volume of mail from outside the country, which earned him the attention of the secret police.[1] Hor\u00e1k died in 1997.\n\n\nThe Cesky Terrier was recognized for international competition by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale in 1963 as breed number 246 in Group 3, Terriers.[2] The breed is now recognized by all of the major kennel clubs in the English-speaking world. The Cesky Terrier is one of the six most rare dog breeds worldwide.[3]\n\n\nThe breed was first imported into the US in the 1980s by a group of enthusiasts. They formed the Cesky Terrier Club of America in January 1988.[4] As interest grew, the breed became eligible to join the American Kennel Club (AKC) Foundation Stock Service Program from January 1, 2004, allowing it to compete in AKC Earthdog tests.[5] At this stage the American Cesky Terrier Fanciers Association was formed and recognised by the AKC.[6] It is the club accepted as the parent club by the AKC.[7] However, the Cesky Terrier Club of America remains active in promoting the breed in the USA.\nFrom mid-2011, the Cesky Terrier was able to compete in the terrier group in America as it was accepted for entry in the AKC Stud Book.[5]\n\n\nThe breed first arrived in the UK in 1989 and had to compete from the imported register. The Cesky Terrier was recognised by the Kennel Club (UK) in 1990[8] and on January 1, 2000, it gained rare breed status. It has since competed successfully in show competition in the UK.[9]\n\n\n\n## Description[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n### Appearance[edit]\n\n\nThe Cesky Terrier is a well-muscled, short legged, well-pigmented, hunting terrier of a rectangular format. The Cesky has natural drop ears, a natural tail, and sports a long, silky with slight texture coat in shades of gray from charcoal to platinum (black pigmented) or rarely brown (liver pigmented). The Cesky is longer than it is tall and has a topline that rises slightly to the rear.\n\n\n\n## Breed standard[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Cesky Terrier during dogs show in Katowice\nThe FCI Breed Standard gives the ideal measurements for the Cesky Terrier as:\n\n\n\n* Height \u2013 Height at withers Ideally 11.5 inches (290\u00a0mm) for a male and 10.5 inches (270\u00a0mm) for a female; no less than 9.5 inches (240\u00a0mm) and no more than 12.5 inches (320\u00a0mm).\n* Weight \u2013 Weight is ideally between 13 and 22 pounds (5.9 and 10.0\u00a0kg).[10]\n* No Cesky in good muscular condition and otherwise well balanced shall be penalized for being only Slightly outside the Ideal height or weight.\n* Length \u2013 The length of body, measured from sternum to buttocks ideally between 16 and 17 inches (410 and 430\u00a0mm).

The overall balance is more important than any single specification.\n* Girth of thorax (behind elbows) \u2013 The girth of the body measured at the thorax, behind the elbows ideally is 17 to 18 inches (430 to 460\u00a0mm).\n\n\nHead\n\n\n\n![](image)Cesky Terrier female head in show trim\n* Expression\u2014Calm and kind.\n* Eyes - Slightly deep set with a friendly expression, of medium size. The color is brown or dark brown in all shades of grey dogs, liver in Brown dogs. Entropion or Ectropion is a disqualifying fault.\n* Ears - Medium size, dropping in such a way to well cover the orifice. Ears are set rather high with forward edge lying close to the cheek. Shaped like a triangle, with the shorter side of the triangle at the fold of the ear.\n* Head \u2013 Head is ideally 8 inches long, 3.5 to 4 inches wide and is shaped like a long, blunt wedge. The plane of the forehead forms a slight but definite stop with the bridge of the nose. The breadth between the ears is slightly larger for a dog than a bitch.\n* Skull \u2013 Skull is shaped like a blunt wedge with the broadest part between the ears which apers moderately towards the supraorbital ridges. Occipital protuberance easy to palpate, cheek bones moderately prominent. Frontal furrow only slightly marked.\n* Muzzle - Nasal Bridge straight. Narrow foreface undesirable.\n* Stop \u2013 Not accentuated but apparent.\n* Nose \u2013 Dark and well developed. The color is black in all shades of grey and liver in brown dogs.\n* Lips\u2014Relatively thick, fitting neatly.\n* Bite\u2014Scissors or level bite, complete dentition preferred. Absence of 2 premolars in lower jaw not to be penalized. Absence of more than 4 teeth or any incisors is a disqualifying fault.\n* Teeth \u2013 Set square to the jaw, strong and regularly aligned.\n\n\nNeck, Topline and Body\n\n\n\n* Neck \u2013 Well muscled and strong. Medium-long, carried on a slant.\n* Topline \u2013 Not straight but with a slight rise.\n* Body \u2013 Fully muscled, oblong. Withers not very pronounced with the neck set rather high.

Flanks well filled.\n* Loins \u2013 Relatively long, muscular, broad and slightly rounded.\n* Tail \u2013 Ideal length is 7 to 8 inches (180 to 200\u00a0mm) inches, relatively strong and low set. Tail may be carried downward or with a slight bend at tip; or carried saber shaped horizontally or higher. All of these tail carriages are considered correct with none having preference over the other. Curled tail or carried over the back to be penalized.\n\n\nForequarters\n\n\n\n* Angulation\u2014Moderately well angulated.\n* Shoulder \u2013 Muscular, well laid back and powerful.\n* Elbows \u2013 Somewhat loose, yet not turned in or out.\n* Legs \u2013 Short, straight, well boned and parallel. Dewclaws may be present.\n* Feet \u2013 Large, well-arched toes with strong nails and well-developed thick pads.\n\n\nHindquarters\n\n\n\n* Angulation\u2014Well angulated.\n* Legs \u2013 Strong, parallel and well muscled.\n* Upper Thigh - Well Muscled.\n* Stifle\u2014Well bent.\n* Second Thigh\u2014relatively short\n* Hock Joint - Strong and well developed.

Not overdone with too much furnishings. Faults: Curly, Coarse or cotton-wool like texture. The Cesky Terrier is groomed by clipping and scissoring into a saddle pattern on the body, with the longer hair ending in a V on the tail. A \"U\" shape is cut out of the top lateral portion of the front legs and Areas of the neck, head, chest, shoulder, tail and rear thigh from the top of the V on the tail to the top of the hock and round the vent is clipped shorter to achieve this appearance and to highlight the well developed muscles of the Cesky Terrier. The Hair on the fore face from mid eye to the rear edge of the lip line is not to be clipped thus forming brows and a beard. The transition between clipped and unclipped areas should be pleasing to the eye and never abrupt.\nColor\n\n\n\nThe Cesky Terrier has two varieties of color: In mature dogs, 3 years or older: 1. Any shade of gray from charcoal to platinum gray with Black pigment. 2. Coffee Brown with Liver pigment. Black may appear on the head, beard, cheeks, ears, feet and tail. White, grey, brown and yellow markings are permitted on the head, beard, cheeks, neck, chest, limbs and around the vent. A white collar or white tip is permitted on the tail. The base color must always be predominant. Faults: Long brindled coat on dogs older than 2 years, white covering more than 20%, and a white blaze are disqualifying faults.[10]\nGait\n\n\n\nThe action should be free, driven and enduring. Gallop rather slow but lasting. The forelegs extend in a straight line forward.\n### Temperament[edit]\n\n\nThe breed standard calls for a calm dog, and aggression is a disqualifying fault. Cesky Terriers are reputed to be less active and quieter than other terriers.[11] This may or may not make them suitable pets for families with children.\n\n\n\n## Care[edit]\n\n\nThe coat of the Cesky Terrier is not *stripped* (dead hair pulled out with the fingers or a special knife) as in other terriers, but rather is clippered. .) The longer hair should be brushed daily.[12]\n\n\n\n## Health[edit]\n\n\nThis breed occasionally suffers from the Scotty Cramp, a minor problem causing awkward movement, but it is not life-threatening.[13]\n\n\nBreeding stock should be checked for hip dysplasia, patella luxation, cardiac abnormalities, PLL (primary lens luxation) and other eye disorders such as cataracts, thyroid issues, degenerative myelopathy, and Type 3 von Willebrand disease, all of which have been documented issues in the breed.[13]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Dogs portal\n* List of dog breeds\n* Terrier\n* Terrier Group\n* Working terrier\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Atter, Sheila. \"Franti\u0161ek Hor\u00e1k\".

Historically used by local market hunters to retrieve waterfowl, pull fishing nets, and rescue fishermen, it is today primarily a family pet and hunting companion, known for a bright and happy disposition; courage; willingness to work; alertness; intelligence; love of water; and hunting capabilities. The Chesapeake is a medium- to large-sized dog similar in appearance to the Labrador Retriever, but with a wavy coat.[2]\n\n\n\n\n## Appearance[edit]\n\n\nDistinctive features include eyes that are very clear, of yellowish or amber hue, hindquarters as high or a trifle higher than the shoulders, and a double-coat that tends to wave on shoulders, neck, back, and loins. The waterproof coat feels slightly oily and is often associated with a slight musky odor.[4][5] Three basic colors are generally seen in the breed: brown, which includes all shades from a light to a deep dark brown; sedge, which varies from a reddish yellow through a bright red to chestnut shades; and deadgrass in all its shades, varying from a faded tan to a dull straw color. The breed standard states that white may also appear but it must be limited to the breast, belly, toes, or back of the feet. The head is round and broad with a medium stop and muzzle. The lips are thin, and the ears are small and of medium leather. The forelegs should be straight with good bone. The hindquarters are especially strong and the toes webbed since excellent swimming ability is important for the Chesapeake. This breed is also known for its large and powerful chest, used to break apart ice when diving into cold water while duck hunting.\n\n\n\n### Coat[edit]\n\n\nThe coat of the Chesapeake Bay Retriever is given the most consideration of any trait listed on the Positive Scale of Points in the Breed Standard. However the AKC Standard also reads *\"The question of coat and general type of balance takes precedence over any scoring table which could be drawn up. The Chesapeake should be well proportioned, an animal with a good coat and well balanced in other points being preferable to one excelling in some but weak in others.\"* The hair on the face and legs should be very short and straight with a tendency to wave, never curl, on the shoulders, neck, back, and loins only and nowhere over 1.5\u00a0inches long. Moderate feathering on the rear of the hindquarters and tail is permissible although not longer than 1.75\u00a0inches long.*[6]*\nThe texture of the thick double-coat is important in protecting the dog from cold water and icy conditions. The oil in the harsh outer coat and woolly undercoat resists water, keeping the dog dry and warm. Maintenance of the coat is minimal and mainly consists of brushing with a short-tooth brush once a week. It is difficult to get a Chesapeake Bay Retriever thoroughly wet, but they should be bathed every 3\u20134 months using a suitably mild shampoo, then dried thoroughly. Brushing or bathing more often can ruin the texture since it strips the protective oil from the coat and may even remove the undercoat.[7][8][9] The color of the coat must be similar to the working surroundings. Any color of brown, sedge or deadgrass is acceptable and one color is not preferred over another. The American Chesapeake Club includes a discussion on color:\n\n\n\nThree basic colors are generally seen in the breed: Brown which includes all shades from a light cocoa (a silvered brown) to a deep bittersweet chocolate color; sedge which varies from a reddish yellow through a bright red to chestnut shades; deadgrass which takes in all shades of deadgrass, varying from a faded tan to a dull straw color. Historic records show that some of the deadgrass shades can be very light, almost white in appearance, while darker deadgrass colors can include diluted shades of brown called ash, that appear as either gray or taupe. The almost white and ash/taupe/gray shades are not commonly seen, but are acceptable.\nThe difference between a sedge and a deadgrass is that the deadgrass shades contain no significant amount of red, while the sedge shades do have red. Coat and texture also play a factor in the perception of color. The self-color pattern is preferred by the standard (One color with or without lighter and darker shadings of the same color). You will see dogs with varying degrees of other markings such as: masking on top of the skull, striping effect of light & dark through the body and on legs, distinct & indistinct saddle markings, agouti coloring and tan points. All are acceptable, they are just not preferred.[10]\nA white spot on the breast (not extending above the sternum), belly, toes or back of the feet is permissible, but the smaller the spot the better. White beyond these areas and black anywhere on the body is not allowed in the breed standard.[6]\n\n\n\n## Temperament[edit]\n\n\nThe quintessential Chesapeake Bay Retriever has a bright and happy disposition, intelligence, quiet good sense, and an affectionate protective nature. Some can be quite vocal when happy, and some will \"smile\" by baring their front teeth in a peculiar grin; this is not a threat, but a sign of joy or submissiveness.\n\n\nChesapeake Bay Retrievers can make excellent family dogs when socialized properly. Some Chesapeakes are assertive and willful and may be reserved with strangers, but others are passive and outgoing with people.\n\n\n\n### Training[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Chesapeake Bay Retriever returning with a Mallard duck![](image)A Chesapeake Bay Retriever competing in agilityThe Chesapeake Bay Retriever is a versatile breed competing in field trials, hunt tests, conformation, obedience, agility and tracking, yet remains true to its roots as a hunting dog of great stamina and ability. The Chesapeake Bay Retriever is an intelligent breed and learns at a high speed. Historically considered stubborn and difficult to train, many trainers thought this breed required more physical discipline than other retriever breeds.[11] Some trainers now recommend that the Chesapeake Bay Retriever owner use consistent, daily obedience training with play time before and after to keep the dog wanting to work with little or no physical discipline required.[12]\n\n\n## Health[edit]\n\n\nThe breed is subject to a number of hereditary diseases. These include, but are not limited to:\n\n\n\n* Exercise-induced collapse[13]\n* Hip dysplasia[14]\n* Progressive retinal atrophy[15]\n* Type 3 von Willebrand disease[16]\n* Cataract[17]\n* Regional Alopecia in both sexes[18]\n\n\nA UK Kennel Club survey puts the median lifespan of the breed at 10.75 years (average 9.85).[19] A US breed club survey puts the average lifespan at 9.4 years. 1 in 4 lived to 13 years or more while 1 in 5 don't live past 5 years.[20]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Chesapeake Bay Retriever circa 1915\nChesapeake Bay Retrievers trace their history to two pups who were rescued from a foundering ship in Maryland in 1807. The male \"Sailor\" and female \"Canton\" were described as Newfoundland dogs, but were more accurately Lesser Newfoundland or St. John's water dogs. These two lived in different parts of the bay area and there is no record of a litter being produced together. They were bred with area dogs, with more consideration given to ability than to breed, to create the beginnings of the Chesapeake Bay Retriever breed. There are few records of the breeds of these early dogs, but spaniels and hounds were included. Dogs from both Chesapeake Bay shores were recognized as one of three types of Chesapeake Bay Ducking Dog in 1877.[*citation needed*] In 1918 a single type, called the Chesapeake Bay Retriever, was recognized by the American Kennel Club, and there have been few changes to the breed standard since then.\n\n\nGeorge Law, who rescued the pups, wrote this account in 1845 which appears on the website of the American Chesapeake Bay Retriever Club:\n\n\n\nIn the fall of 1807 I was on board of the ship *Canton*, belonging to my uncle, the late Hugh Thompson, of Baltimore, when we fell in, at sea, near the termination of a very heavy equinoctial gale, with an English brig in a sinking condition, and took off the crew. The brig was loaded with codfish, and was bound to Pole, in England, from Newfoundland. I boarded her, in command of a boat from the Canton, which was sent to take off the English crew, the brig's own boats having been all swept away, and her crew in a state of intoxication. I found onboard of her two Newfoundland pups, male and female, which I saved, and subsequently, on our landing the English crew at Norfolk, our own destination being Baltimore, I purchased these two pups of the English captain for a guinea apiece. Being bound again to sea, I gave the dog pup, which was called Sailor, to Mr. John Mercer, of West River; and the slut pup, which was called Canton, to Doctor James Stewart, of Sparrow's Point. The history which the English captain gave me of these pups was, that the owner of his brig was extensively engaged in the Newfoundland trade, and had directed his correspondent to select and send him a pair of pups of the most approved Newfoundland breed, but of different families, and that the pair I purchased of him were selected under this order. The dog was of a dingy red colour; and the slut black. They were not large; their hair was short, but very thick-coated; they had dew claws. Both attained great reputation as water-dogs. They were most sagacious in every thing, particularly so in all duties connected with duck-shooting. Governor Lloyd exchanged a Merino ram for the dog, at the time of the Merino fever, when such rams were selling for many hundred dollars, and took him over to his estate on the eastern shore of Maryland, where his progeny were well known for many years after; and may still be known there, and on the western shore, as the Sailor breed. The slut remained at Sparrows Point till her death, and her progeny were and are still well known, through Patapsco Neck, on the Gunpowder, and up the bay, amongst the duck-shooters, as unsurpassed for their purposes. I have heard both Doctor Stewart and Mr. Mercer relate most extraordinary instances of the sagacity and performance of both dog and slut, and would refer you to their friends for such particulars as I am unable, at this distance of time, to recollect with sufficient accuracy to repeat.[21][*better\u00a0source\u00a0needed*]\nMercer is said[*who?*] to have described Sailor:\n\n\n\n... he was of fine size and figure-lofty in his carriage, and built for strength and activity; remarkably muscular and broad across the hips and breast; head large, but not out of proportion; muzzle rather longer than is common with that race of dogs; his colour a dingy red, with some white on the face and breast; his coat short and smooth, but uncommonly thick, and more like a coarse fur than hair; tail full, with long hair, and always carried very high. His eyes were very peculiar: they were so light as to have almost an unnatural appearance, something resembling what is termed a wail eye, in a horse; and it is remarkable, that in a visit which I made to the Eastern Shore, nearly twenty years after he was sent there, in a sloop which had been sent expressly for him, to West River, by Governor Lloyd, I saw many of his descendants who were marked with this peculiarity.[*citation needed*]\nIn 1964, it was declared the official dog of Maryland.[22] It is the mascot of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County.\n\n\nMembers of the breed were owned by General George Armstrong Custer, President Theodore Roosevelt, Senator John McCain, and actors Paul Walker and Tom Felton.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Dogs portal\n* List of dog breeds\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"FCI Breeds nomenclature\". 2009.

The breed is used for hunting in packs and descends from the old Hound of Saintonge type of large hunting dog.\n\n\n\n\n## Appearance[edit]\n\n\nThe breed is a typical hunting pack hound, with a lean and muscular body, long legs, slightly domed head, long drop ears, and slightly square flews that just overlap the lower lip. Size is 65 to 72\u00a0cm (25.6 to 28.3 ins) at the withers, females slightly smaller.\n\n\nThe colour of the coat is white and black, with a black mantle, sometimes speckled or ticked with black or blue. Pale tan dots are above each eye as well as tan on the cheeks, below the eyes and ears, and below the tail. Sometimes a tan marking is found on the base of the upper thigh, which is called the 'roe buck mark'. Faults are listed as deviations in appearance that have an effect on the health and working ability of the dog, as well as indication of crossing with Foxhounds or being off-colour, indicating that a dog with such faults should not be bred.[1]\n\n\nThe breed is noted for its perseverance on the hunt as well as a good nose and voice. Unusual for pack dogs, it is friendly and easy for humans to manage.[1]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nThe breed's ancestry was in the old Hound of Saintonge, which almost disappeared during the French Revolution, through the Gascon Saintongeois breed created by Count Joseph de Carayon-Latour in the mid-19th century.[2] The Gascon Saintongeois hounds were crossbred with the Poitevin in the late 19th century to produce the Chien Fran\u00e7ais Blanc et Noir. The dogs were officially recognised as a breed in 1957. In 2009, there were approximately 2000 of the breed registered through the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale.[1]\n\n\nThe Chien Fran\u00e7ais Blanc et Noir are pack hunting dogs, which means that groups hunt together in packs, always directed by a human, not running about hunting by themselves.[3] The Chien Fran\u00e7ais Blanc et Noir packs are especially valued in the hunting of red deer or roe deer.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Dogs portal\n* List of dog breeds\n* Anglo-French Hounds\n* Dog terminology\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Breed Standard Archived June 6, 2011, at the Wayback Machine\n2. **^** Clark, Anne Rogers; Andrew H.

It has a lean and muscular body, long legs, slightly domed head, long drop ears, and a coat that is white and black with specific tan markings. The breed was officially recognized in 1957 and is valued for pack hunting, especially in hunting red deer or roe deer.\n\nThe ancestry of the Chien Fran\u00e7ais Blanc et Noir can be traced back to the old Hound of Saintonge, which almost disappeared during the French Revolution. The breed was developed through crossbreeding with the Gascon Saintongeois and Poitevin hounds in the 19th century. As of 2009, there were approximately 2000 of the breed registered through the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale.\n\nIf you would like more information or details, feel free to ask!",

The breed is used for hunting in packs and descends from the old Hound of Saintonge type of large hunting dog.\n\n\n\n\n## Appearance[edit]\n\n\nThe breed is a typical large French hunting pack hound, with a lean and muscular body, long legs, slightly domed head, long drop ears, and slightly square flews. Size is 62 to a maximum of 70\u00a0cm (23.6 to 27.6 ins) at the withers, making it slightly smaller than the Chien Fran\u00e7ais Blanc et Noir.\n\n\nThe colour of the coat is white and orange, but the orange should never appear to be a red colour. The dog's skin is the same colour as the fur, orange under the orange fur and white under the white fur. Faults are listed as physical or behavioural abnormalities, and a dog with such faults should not be bred.[1]\n\n\nThe breed is noted for its perseverance on the hunt as well as a good nose and voice. Unusual for pack dogs, it is friendly and easy for humans to manage.[1]\n\n\n\n## Use[edit]\n\n\nThe Chien Fran\u00e7ais Blanc et Orange are pack-hunting dogs, which means that groups of dogs are hunted together, always directed by a human, not running about hunting by themselves.[2]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Dogs portal\n* List of dog breeds\n* Anglo-French Hounds\n* Dog

The breed is used for hunting in packs.\n\n\n\n\n## Appearance[edit]\n\n\nThe breed is a typical large French hunting pack hound, with a lean and muscular body, long legs, elongated head with a noticeable occipital protuberance, long drop ears, and slightly square flews. Their size is 62 to 72 centimetres (24 to 28\u00a0in) at the withers; females are slightly smaller.\n\n\nThe coat is tricolour, with a wide black mantle, and tan parts are of a bright colour. A grizzled colour called \"louvard\" (\"wolf-like\") is also seen in the breed. Faults are listed as physical or behavioural abnormalities, and a dog with such faults should not be bred. Faults include fat feet, aggression, or any trace of crossing with English hounds.[1]\n\n\n\n## Use[edit]\n\n\nThe Chien Fran\u00e7ais Tricolore are pack hunting dogs, which means that groups of dogs are hunted together, always directed by a human, not running about hunting by themselves.[2] Dogs bred to be pack hunting dogs do not usually make good pets.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Dogs
