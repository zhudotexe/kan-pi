Two years later, one of the race's pacemakers, Simon Biwott won the race, after one of the favourites had pulled out in the second half of the race. In 2001, Naoko Takahashi became the first woman to run a sub-2:20 marathon, completing the Berlin Marathon in 2:19:46. The race had continued to be the venue of world records; between 2003 and 2018, seven men's records were set at the race; the most recent remains as the current world record time; Eliud Kipchoge's 2:01:39.[7][8]\n\n\nThe event was held in mid-September in 2000 and 2018, because of a conflict with the Women's Olympic Marathon, and due to German Unity Day preparations, respectively.[9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAnnual race in Germany since 1974\n\n\n\n| Berlin Marathon |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) |\n| Date | Last weekend of September |\n| Location | Berlin, Germany |\n| Event type | Road |\n| Distance | Marathon |\n| Primary sponsor | BMW |\n| Established | 1974 (50 years ago) (1974) |\n| Course records | **Men:** 2:01:09 (2022)  ![Kenya](image) Eliud Kipchoge **Women:** 2:11:53 (2023, **WR**) ![Ethiopia](image) Tigist Assefa |\n| Official site | Berlin Marathon |\n| Participants | 34,879 finishers (2022)[1] 23,097 finishers (2021)[2]44,064 (2019) |\n| ![](image) *2024 Berlin Marathon* |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** BERLIN-MARATHON: Zahlen und Rekorde: Die Teilnehmerzahlen 2022\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"47.

It is traditionally held on Patriots' Day, the third Monday of April.[1] Begun in 1897, the event was inspired by the success of the first marathon competition in the 1896 Summer Olympics.[2] The Boston Marathon is the world's oldest annual marathon and ranks as one of the world's best-known road racing events. It is one of six World Marathon Majors. Its course runs from Hopkinton in southern Middlesex County to Copley Square in Boston.\n\n\nThe Boston Athletic Association (B.A.A.) has organized this event annually since 1897,[3] including a \"virtual alternative\" after the 2020 road race was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The race has been managed by DMSE Sports since 1988. Amateur and professional runners from all over the world compete in the Boston Marathon each year, braving the hilly Massachusetts terrain and varying weather to take part in the race.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn October 28, 2020, the B.A.A. announced that the 2021 edition of the marathon would not be held in April; organizers stated that they hoped to stage the event later in the year, possibly in the autumn.[48] In late January 2021, organizers announced October 11 as the date for the marathon, contingent upon road races being allowed in Massachusetts at that time.[49] In March, organizers announced that the field would be limited to 20,000 runners.[50] The race was the fourth of the five World Marathon Majors held in 2021; all the events in the series were run in the space of six weeks between late September and early November.[51] In 2021, the B.A.A. also offered a virtual alternative to the in-person race to be completed anytime between 8-10 October.[52]\n\n\n\n## Race[edit]\n\n\n### Qualifying[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n17. **^** Gibbs, Roberta \"Bobbi\". \"Roberta \"Bobbi\" Gibb - A Run of One's Own\".

While marathons sporadically occurred in New York City and St. Louis,[12] the Boston Marathon had established an annual marathon in 1897, soon to be followed by a Chicago annual race.[13] Beginning in 1905,[14] the Chicago Marathon (organized first by the Illinois Athletic Club 1905 to 1909, then sponsored by the *Chicago Daily News* after 1910) was held annually, with significant community and spectator support, until the early 1920s.[15]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIt was not until the health consciousness of the 1960s that marathon growth gained traction in the public's eyes. Frank Shorter's 1972 Games of the XX Olympiad marathon victory represented the convergence of many middle-class American ideals.[18] Then the 1976 New York City Marathon, which was the first New York City Marathon to embrace the five borough course, popularized the big city marathon. As the New York marathon began to grow exponentially in the 1970s, the Chicago Marathon was established as a rival to the New York City Marathon.[3] By the mid-1980s, the Chicago Marathon was ensconced as one of the big four marathons.[19] During the mid-1980s, it was named America's Marathon/Chicago and opened up the way for appearance payments. Joan Benoit Samuelson described the Chicago Marathons of the mid-1980s as \"The World's Marathon\".[20] The Bank of America Chicago Marathon is an open race with no qualifying time to participate.[6]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* 2015–16: Florence Kiplagat (KEN)\n* 2017: Tirunesh Dibaba (ETH)\n* 2018–19: Brigid Kosgei (KEN)\n* 2020: *cancelled*\n* 2021–22: Ruth Chepngetich (KEN)\n |\n| World Marathon Majors\nBerlin Marathon – List (M/W)\nBoston Marathon – List (M/W)\nChicago Marathon – List (M/W)\nLondon Marathon – List (M/W)\nNew York City Marathon – List (M/W)\nTokyo Marathon – List (M/W)\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nWorld Marathon Majors\n |\n| --- |\n| Marathons | * Tokyo\n\t+ winners\n* Boston\n\t+ winners\n* London\n\t+ winners\n* Berlin\n\t+ winners\n* Chicago\n\t+ winners\n* New York City\n\t+ winners\n |\n| Results | * Final standings\n |\n| * Marathons at the World Athletics Championships\n* IAAF World Marathon Cup\n* Marathons at the Olympics\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nWorld Athletics Label Road Races\n |\n| --- |\n| Editions | * 2008\n* 2009\n* 2010\n* 2011\n* 2012\n* 2013\n* 2014\n* 2015\n* 2016\n* 2017\n* 2018\n* 2019\n* 2020\n* 2021\n* 2022\n* 2023\n* 2024\n |\n| Platinum | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* 2014: Eliud Kipchoge (KEN)\n* 2015: Dickson Chumba (KEN)\n* 2016: Abel Kirui (KEN)\n* 2017: Galen Rupp (USA)\n* 2018: Mo Farah (GBR)\n* 2019: Lawrence Cherono (KEN)\n* 2020: *cancelled*\n* 2021: Seifu Tura (ETH)\n* 2022: Benson Kipruto (KEN)\n* 2023: Kelvin Kiptum (KEN)\n |\n| World Marathon Majors\nBerlin Marathon – List (M/W)\nBoston Marathon – List (M/W)\nChicago Marathon – List (M/W)\nLondon Marathon – List (M/W)\nNew York City Marathon – List (M/W)\nTokyo Marathon – List (M/W)\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"World Marathon Majors\".

Organized by the British Sports Association for the Disabled (BASD), 19 people competed and 17 finished.

Only 55 runners crossed the finish line.[9]\n\n\nOver the years, the marathon grew larger and larger.[10] To celebrate the U.S. bicentennial in 1976, city auditor George Spitz proposed that the race traverse all five boroughs. With the support of Manhattan Borough President Percy Sutton, the men convinced Mayor Abraham Beame and, eventually, race director Fred Lebow. The race was a huge success, and what was intended as a one-time celebration became the annual course.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n32. **^** \"Huckabee Finishes New York Marathon Despite Sore Knee\" Archived September 27, 2007, at the Wayback Machine, The Associated Press, November 6, 2006.\n33. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Race Officials Confirm That 2 Died After Marathon - NYTimes.com.

However, years prior to 2007, Tokyo Marathon actually consisted of two marathons - the Tokyo International Marathon which took place on even years, and Tokyo - New York Friendship International Marathon which took place on odd years. In the inaugural year, 1981, both marathons took place. However, because it was not possible to support two marathons a month apart in the same city, from 1982, the alternating format went into effect.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe 2007 marathon was also a representative selection race of the 2007 World Championships in Athletics in Osaka. The total number of participants was set at 30,000. Of that, 25,000 people signed up for the marathon, and 5,000 signed up for the 10K run.\n\n\nMasakazu Fujiwara became the race's first Japanese male winner at the fourth edition.[5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n9. **^** \"Regarding the Tokyo Marathon 2021 | TOKYO MARATHON 2021\". 2020-10-09.
