G. Wells and Hugo Gernsback.[7] In the 2010s, he was the most translated French author in the world. In France, 2005 was declared \"Jules Verne Year\" on the occasion of the centenary of the writer's death.\n\n\n\n\n## Life[edit]\n\n\n### Early life[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nTranslation of Verne into English began in 1852, when Verne's short story *A Voyage in a Balloon* (1851) was published in the American journal *Sartain's Union Magazine of Literature and Art* in a translation by Anne T. Wilbur.[112] Translation of his novels began in 1869 with William Lackland's translation of *Five Weeks in a Balloon* (originally published in 1863),[113] and continued steadily throughout Verne's lifetime, with publishers and hired translators often working in great haste to rush his most lucrative titles into English-language print.[114] Unlike Hetzel, who targeted all ages with his publishing strategies for the *Voyages extraordinaires*, the British and American publishers of Verne chose to market his books almost exclusively to young audiences; this business move, with its implication that Verne could be treated purely as a children's author, had a long-lasting effect on Verne's reputation in English-speaking countries.[110][115]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Evans, Arthur B.

It's a bizarre situation for a world-famous writer to be in. Indeed, I can't think of a major writer who has been so poorly served by translation.\"[116]\n\n\nSimilarly, the American novelist Michael Crichton observed:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Monument to Verne in Redondela, Spain\nVerne's novels have had a wide influence on both literary and scientific works; writers known to have been influenced by Verne include Marcel Aym\u00e9, Roland Barthes, Ren\u00e9 Barjavel, Michel Butor, Blaise Cendrars, Paul Claudel, Jean Cocteau, Julio Cort\u00e1zar, Fran\u00e7ois Mauriac, Rick Riordan, Raymond Roussel, Claude Roy, Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry, and Jean-Paul Sartre,[124] while scientists and explorers who acknowledged Verne's inspiration have included Richard E. Byrd, Yuri Gagarin, Simon Lake, Hubert Lyautey, Guglielmo Marconi, Fridtjof Nansen, Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, Wernher von Braun,[109] and Jack Parsons.[125] Verne is credited with helping inspire the steampunk genre, a literary and social movement that glamorizes science fiction based on 19th-century technology.[126][127]\n\n\nRay Bradbury summarized Verne's influence on literature and science the world over by saying: \"We are all, in one way or another, the children of Jules Verne.\"[128]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nVerne's reputation in English-speaking countries has been considerably slower in changing. Throughout the 20th century, most anglophone scholars dismissed Verne as a genre writer for children and a na\u00efve proponent of science and technology (despite strong evidence to the contrary on both counts), thus finding him more interesting as a technological \"prophet\" or as a subject of comparison to English-language writers such as Edgar Allan Poe and H. G. Wells than as a topic of literary study in his own right. This narrow view of Verne has undoubtedly been influenced by the poor-quality English translations and very loosely adapted Hollywood film versions through which most American and British readers have discovered Verne.[5][109] However, since the mid-1980s a considerable number of serious English-language studies and translations have appeared, suggesting that a rehabilitation of Verne's anglophone reputation may currently be underway.[110][111]\n\n\n\n### English translations[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\u200b\n \u200b\n(m.\u00a01857)\u200b\n |\n| Children | Valentine Morel (stepdaughter)Suzanne Morel (stepdaughter)Michel Verne |\n| Signature |\n| ![](image) |\n\n\n**Jules Gabriel Verne** (/v\u025c\u02d0rn/;[1][2] French: [\u0292yl \u0261ab\u0281ij\u025bl v\u025b\u0281n]; 8 February 1828 \u2013 24 March 1905)[3] was a French novelist, poet, and playwright.

He is widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's pre-eminent dramatist.[3][4][5] He is often called England's national poet and the \"Bard of Avon\" (or simply \"the Bard\"). His extant works, including collaborations, consist of some 39 plays, 154 sonnets, three long narrative poems, and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright.[6] Shakespeare remains arguably the most influential writer in the English language, and his works continue to be studied and reinterpreted.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nShakespeare's influence extends far beyond his native England and the English language. His reception in Germany was particularly significant; as early as the 18th century Shakespeare was widely translated and popularised in Germany, and gradually became a \"classic of the German Weimar era;\" Christoph Martin Wieland was the first to produce complete translations of Shakespeare's plays in any language.[235][236] Actor and theatre director Simon Callow writes, \"this master, this titan, this genius, so profoundly British and so effortlessly universal, each different culture \u2013 German, Italian, Russian \u2013 was obliged to respond to the Shakespearean example; for the most part, they embraced it, and him, with joyous abandon, as the possibilities of language and character in action that he celebrated liberated writers across the continent. Some of the most deeply affecting productions of Shakespeare have been non-English, and non-European. He is that unique writer: he has something for everyone.\"[237]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nA series of scholarly editions of his work, notably those of Samuel Johnson in 1765 and Edmond Malone in 1790, added to his growing reputation.[248][249] By 1800, he was firmly enshrined as the national poet,[250] and described as the \"Bard of Avon\" (or simply \"the Bard\").[251][h] In the 18th and 19th centuries, his reputation also spread abroad. Among those who championed him were the writers Voltaire, Goethe, Stendhal, and Victor Hugo.[253][i]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n237. **^** \"Simon Callow: What the Dickens?

Her books are still enormously popular and have been translated into ninety languages. As of June 2019, Blyton held 4th place for the most translated author. She wrote on a wide range of topics, including education, natural history, fantasy, mystery, and biblical narratives. She is best remembered today for her *Noddy*, *Famous Five*, *Secret Seven*, the *Five Find-Outers*, and *Malory Towers* books, although she also wrote many others, including the *St. Clare's*, *The Naughtiest Girl*, and *The Faraway Tree* series.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nRowling, Jane Austen and Shakespeare.[124][125] Her books continue to be very popular among children in Commonwealth nations such as India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Singapore, Malta, New Zealand and Australia, and around the world.[126] They have also seen a surge of popularity in China, where they are \"big with every generation\".[75] In March 2004, Chorion and the Chinese publisher Foreign Language Teaching and Research Press negotiated an agreement over the Noddy franchise, which included bringing the character to an animated series on television, with a potential audience of a further 95 million children under the age of five.[127][128] Chorion spent around \u00a310\u00a0million digitising Noddy and, as of 2002, had made television agreements with at least 11 countries worldwide.[129]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2010 Hodder, the publisher of the Famous Five series, announced its intention to update the language used in the books, of which it sold more than half a million copies a year. The changes, which Hodder described as \"subtle\", mainly affect the dialogue rather than the narrative. For instance, \"school tunic\" becomes \"uniform\", \"mother and father\" and \"mother and daddy\" (this latter one used by young female characters and deemed sexist) become \"mum and dad\",[161] \"bathing\" is replaced by \"swimming\", and \"jersey\" by \"jumper\".[157] Some commentators see the changes as necessary to encourage modern readers,[161] whereas others regard them as unnecessary and patronising.[157] In 2016 Hodder's parent company Hachette announced that they would abandon the revisions as, based on feedback, they had not been a success.[162]\n\n\n\n## Stage, film and television adaptations[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Associated subjects\n |\n| --- |\n| | * v\n* t\n* e\n*The Famous Five* by Enid Blyton\n |\n| --- |\n| Enid Blyton novels | * *Five on a Treasure Island* (1942)\n* *Five Go Adventuring Again* (1943)\n* *Five Run Away Together* (1944)\n* *Five Go to Smuggler's Top* (1945)\n* *Five Go Off in a Caravan* (1946)\n* *Five on Kirrin Island Again* (1947)\n* *Five Go Off to Camp* (1948)\n* *Five Get into Trouble* (1949)\n* *Five Fall into Adventure* (1950)\n* *Five on a Hike Together* (1951)\n* *Five Have a Wonderful Time* (1952)\n* *Five Go Down to the Sea* (1953)\n* *Five Go to Mystery Moor* (1954)\n* *Five Have Plenty of Fun* (1955)\n* *Five on a Secret Trail* (1956)\n* *Five Go to Billycock Hill* (1957)\n* *Five Get into a Fix* (1958)\n* *Five on Finniston Farm* (1960)\n* *Five Go to Demon's Rocks* (1961)\n* *Five Have a Mystery to Solve* (1962)\n* *Five Are Together Again* (1963)\n |\n| Film adaptations | * *Five on a Treasure Island* (1957)\n* *Five Have a Mystery to Solve* (1964)\n* *Five Get into Trouble* (1970)\n* *Famous Five* (2012)\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNovelists influenced by Blyton include the crime writer Denise Danks, whose fictional detective Georgina Powers is based on George from the Famous Five. Peter Hunt's *A Step off the Path* (1985) is also influenced by the Famous Five, and the St. Clare's and Malory Towers series provided the inspiration for Jacqueline Wilson's *Double Act* (1996) and Ad\u00e8le Geras's Egerton Hall trilogy (1990\u201392) respectively.[130] Blyton was important to Stieg Larsson. \"The series Stieg Larsson most often mentioned were the Famous Five and the Adventure books.\"[131]\n\n\n\n## Critical backlash[edit]\n\n\nA.H.
