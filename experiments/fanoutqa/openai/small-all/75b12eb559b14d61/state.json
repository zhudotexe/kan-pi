Commander Neil Armstrong and Lunar Module Pilot Buzz Aldrin landed the Apollo Lunar Module *Eagle* on July 20, 1969, at 20:17 UTC, and Armstrong became the first person to step onto the Moon's surface six hours and 39 minutes later, on July 21 at 02:56 UTC. Aldrin joined him 19 minutes later, and they spent about two and a quarter hours together exploring the site they had named Tranquility Base upon landing. Armstrong and Aldrin collected 47.5 pounds (21.5\u00a0kg) of lunar material to bring back to Earth as pilot Michael Collins flew the Command Module *Columbia* in lunar orbit, and were on the Moon's surface for 21 hours, 36 minutes before lifting off to rejoin *Columbia*.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n276. **^** Dunn, Marcia (July 19, 2019). \"Apollo 11 astronauts reunite on 50th anniversary of moonshot\". *ABC*.

The bill was sponsored by Florida Senator Bill Nelson and Florida Representative Alan Grayson.[265][266]\n\n\nA group of British scientists interviewed as part of the anniversary events reflected on the significance of the Moon landing:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOne of the first versions of the egress checklist had the lunar module pilot exit the spacecraft before the commander, which matched what had been done on Gemini missions,[92] where the commander had never performed the spacewalk.[93] Reporters wrote in early 1969 that Aldrin would be the first man to walk on the Moon, and Associate Administrator George Mueller told reporters he would be first as well. Aldrin heard that Armstrong would be the first because Armstrong was a civilian, which made Aldrin livid. Aldrin attempted to persuade other lunar module pilots he should be first, but they responded cynically about what they perceived as a lobbying campaign. Attempting to stem interdepartmental conflict, Slayton told Aldrin that Armstrong would be first since he was the commander. The decision was announced in a press conference on April 14, 1969.[94]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Soviet Union appeared to be winning the Space Race by beating the US to firsts, but its early lead was overtaken by the US Gemini program and Soviet failure to develop the N1 launcher, which would have been comparable to the Saturn V.[48] The Soviets tried to beat the US to return lunar material to the Earth by means of uncrewed probes. On July 13, three days before Apollo 11's launch, the Soviet Union launched Luna 15, which reached lunar orbit before Apollo 11. During descent, a malfunction caused Luna 15 to crash in Mare Crisium about two hours before Armstrong and Aldrin took off from the Moon's surface to begin their voyage home. The Nuffield Radio Astronomy Laboratories radio telescope in England recorded transmissions from Luna 15 during its descent, and these were released in July 2009 for the 40th anniversary of Apollo 11.[49]\n\n\n\n## Personnel[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) |\n| Part of a series on |\n| Apollo 11 |\n| * **Crew**\n\t+ Neil Armstrong \u00b7 Buzz Aldrin \u00b7 Michael Collins\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Aldrin, Buzz; Abraham, Ken (2016). *No Dream is Too High: Life Lessons from a Man who Walked on the Moon*.

When Armstrong first stepped onto the lunar surface, he famously said: \"That's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.\"[1][2][3][4] It was broadcast live to an estimated 530 million viewers worldwide. Apollo 11 was a major U.S. victory in the Space Race, by fulfilling a national goal proposed in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy \"of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth\" before the end of the decade. Along with Collins and Aldrin, Armstrong was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Richard Nixon and received the 1969 Collier Trophy. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAfter being released from an 18-day quarantine to ensure that they had not picked up any infections or diseases from the Moon, the crew was feted across the United States and around the world as part of a 38-day \"Giant Leap\" tour.[162] \n\n![](image)New York City ticker tape parade, August 13, 1969\nThe tour began on August 13, when the three astronauts spoke and rode in ticker-tape parades in their honor in New York and Chicago, with an estimated six million attendees.[163][164] On the same evening an official state dinner was held in Los Angeles to celebrate the flight, attended by members of Congress, 44\u00a0governors, the Chief Justice of the United States, and ambassadors from 83\u00a0nations. President Nixon and Vice President Agnew presented each astronaut with a Presidential Medal of Freedom.[163][165]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAccording to Chris Kraft, a March 1969 meeting among Slayton, George Low, Bob Gilruth, and Kraft determined that Armstrong would be the first person on the Moon, in part because NASA management saw him as a person who did not have a large ego. A press conference on April 14, 1969, gave the design of the LM cabin as the reason for Armstrong's being first; the hatch opened inwards and to the right, making it difficult for the LM pilot, on the right-hand side, to exit first. At the time of their meeting, the four men did not know about the hatch consideration. The first knowledge of the meeting outside the small group came when Kraft wrote his book.[113][114] Methods of circumventing this difficulty existed, but it is not known if these were considered at the time. Slayton added, \"Secondly, just on a pure protocol basis, I figured the commander ought to be the first guy out\u00a0... I changed it as soon as I found they had the time line that showed that. Bob Gilruth approved my decision.\"[115]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn April 5, 1967, the same day the Apollo\u00a01 investigation released its final report, Armstrong and 17 other astronauts gathered for a meeting with Slayton. The first thing Slayton said was, \"The guys who are going to fly the first lunar missions are the guys in this room.\"[100] According to Cernan, only Armstrong showed no reaction to the statement. To Armstrong it came as no surprise\u2014the room was full of veterans of Project Gemini, the only people who could fly the lunar missions. Slayton talked about the planned missions and named Armstrong to the backup crew for Apollo 9, which at that stage was planned as a medium Earth orbit test of the combined lunar module and command and service module.[101]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n258. **^** \"Neil A.

However, when Aldrin learned that this might be amended, he lobbied within NASA for the original procedure to be followed. Multiple factors contributed to the final decision, including the physical positioning of the astronauts within the compact lunar lander, which made it easier for Armstrong to be the first to exit the spacecraft. Furthermore, there was little support for Aldrin's views among senior astronauts who would command later Apollo missions.[63] Collins has commented that he thought Aldrin \"resents not being first on the Moon more than he appreciates being second\".[64]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n27. **^** \"2000 Distinguished Graduate Award\".

He was the astronaut who executed John Aaron's \"Flight, try SCE to 'Aux'\" instruction to restore telemetry after the spacecraft was struck by lightning 36 seconds after launch, thus salvaging the mission. They explored the lunar surface, deployed several lunar surface experiments, and installed the first nuclear power generator station on the Moon to provide the power source.

Two days later he traveled to Boston with Louise for the wedding of his cousin Anne, and was able to break the news to his parents and sister.[57][58] The identities of the seven were announced at a press conference at Dolley Madison House in Washington, D.C., on April 9, 1959:[59] Scott Carpenter, Gordon Cooper, John Glenn, Gus Grissom, Wally Schirra, Alan Shepard, and Deke Slayton.[60] The magnitude of the challenge ahead of them was made clear a few weeks later, on the night of May 18, 1959, when the seven astronauts gathered at Cape Canaveral to watch their first rocket launch, of an SM-65D Atlas, which was similar to the one that was to carry them into orbit. A few minutes after liftoff, it spectacularly exploded, lighting up the night sky. The astronauts were stunned.

The Navy and Marine Corps officers were welcomed by the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Arleigh Burke, while the United States Air Force officers were addressed by the Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force, General Thomas D. White. Both pledged their support to the Space Program, and promised that the careers of volunteers would not be adversely affected. NASA officials then briefed them on Project Mercury. They conceded that it would be a hazardous undertaking, but emphasized that it was of great national importance. That evening, Shepard discussed the day's events with fellow naval aviators Jim Lovell, Pete Conrad and Wally Schirra, all of whom would eventually become astronauts. They were concerned about their careers, but decided to volunteer.[52][53]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n109. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Apollo 14\". *Apollo to the Moon*.
