The award was not presented in 1967. The official guidelines are as follows: \"For a new artist who releases, during the Eligibility Year, the first recording which establishes the public identity of that artist.\" Note that this is not necessarily the first album released by an artist; for example, Shelby Lynne won the award in 2001 after having already released six albums over 13 years.[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHonor presented to recording artists\n\n\"Best New Artist\" redirects here.

In 2010, Lady Gaga's exclusion from the Best New Artist category caused the Recording Academy to change eligibility requirements for the next ceremony. She was ineligible for the nomination because her hit \"Just Dance\" had been nominated in 2008. The new rule stated that an artist may be nominated as long as that artist has not previously released an entire album and has subsequently not won a Grammy.[22][23] In June 2016, the Grammy organization amended the Best New Artist rules once again, to remove the album barrier \"given current trends in how new music and developing artists are released and promoted\".[24] To be eligible in the category of Best New Artist, the artist, duo, or group:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n**^[II]**  The Grammy Award for Best New Artist wasn't presented during the 9th Grammy Awards.[90][91]  \n\n**^[III]**  Milli Vanilli were originally presented with the award on February 21, 1990, but were later stripped of it after admitting that they were not the actual singers on their album.[6] The category was left vacant for the year.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of Grammy Award categories\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n**General**\n\n\n\n* \"Grammy Awards: New Artist\".

A list of the top twenty artists was given to the Nominations Review Committee, a specially selected group of anonymous members, who initially selected the top five artists to gain a nomination in the category in a special ballot; the number of nominated artists was increased to eight in 2018.[15][16] The rest of the members then vote on a winner from the final nominees.[17] In 2021, it was announced that the Nomination Review Committees would be disbanded, and the final nominees for best new artist would be decided by votes from members.[18] Starting in 2022, the number of nominees in the category increased to 10.[19] However, the decision to expand the number of nominees in this category was made 24 hours before the nominees were announced after an early version of the nominations list had already been circulated. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* (years are of music release; ceremonies are the next year)\n |\n| Related | * Grammy Museum\n |\n| By country | * American\n* Argentine\n* Australian\n* Austrian\n* Brazilian\n* British\n* Canadian\n* Chinese\n* Cuban\n* French\n* Indian\n* Irish\n* Italian\n* Japanese\n* Malian\n* Mexican\n* Nigerian\n* New Zealand\n* Peruvian\n* Polish\n* Senegalese\n* South African\n* Spanish\n* Other countries\n |\n| * Album of the Year\n* Record of the Year\n* Song of the Year\n* Best New Artist\n* Producer of the Year, Non-Classical\n* Songwriter of the Year, Non-Classical\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Best New Artist award has a reputation for being given to artists whose music industry success ends up being short-lived; it is sometimes asserted, with varying degrees of sincerity, that the award itself brings a curse.[3][4] This viewpoint was expressed by former Starland Vocal Band member Taffy Danoff in a 2002 interview for VH1's *100 Greatest One Hit Wonders*: \"We got two of the five Grammys – one was Best New Artist. So that was basically the kiss of death and I feel sorry for everyone who's gotten it since.\"[5]\n\n\nThe category is also notable for being the only category in which a Grammy Award was vacated; this occurred in 1990 after it was revealed that winners Milli Vanilli did not contribute their own vocals on their album, *Girl You Know It's True*.[6] The award was not then given to another artist.[7]\n\n\n\n\n## Further information[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n78. **^** Martens, Todd (December 1, 2010). \"Grammys 2011: Justin Bieber, Florence + the Machine and the best new artist crop\". *Los Angeles Times*.

The category was then expanded to include eight nominees in 2019.[25] Starting in 2021, screening committees were charged with determining whether the artist had attained a breakthrough or prominence prior to the eligibility year. Such a determination would result in disqualification.[26]\n\n\n\n## Recipients[edit]\n\n\n### 1960s[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nGrammy Award for Best New Artist\n |\n| --- |\n| 1950s | * No Award (1958)\n* Bobby Darin (1959)\n |\n| 1960s | * Bob Newhart (1960)\n* Peter Nero (1961)\n* Robert Goulet (1962)\n* The Swingle Singers (1963)\n* The Beatles (1964)\n* Tom Jones (1965)\n* No Award (1966)\n* Bobbie Gentry (1967)\n* José Feliciano (1968)\n* Crosby, Stills & Nash (1969)\n |\n| 1970s | * The Carpenters (1970)\n* Carly Simon (1971)\n* America (1972)\n* Bette Midler (1973)\n* Marvin Hamlisch (1974)\n* Natalie Cole (1975)\n* Starland Vocal Band (1976)\n* Debby Boone (1977)\n* A Taste of Honey (1978)\n* Rickie Lee Jones (1979)\n |\n| 1980s | * Christopher Cross (1980)\n* Sheena Easton (1981)\n* Men at Work (1982)\n* Culture Club (1983)\n* Cyndi Lauper (1984)\n* Sade (1985)\n* Bruce Hornsby & The Range (1986)\n* Jody Watley (1987)\n* Tracy Chapman (1988)\n* ~~Milli Vanilli~~ (1989)\n |\n| 1990s | * Mariah Carey (1990)\n* Marc Cohn (1991)\n* Arrested Development (1992)\n* Toni Braxton (1993)\n* Sheryl Crow (1994)\n* Hootie & the Blowfish (1995)\n* LeAnn Rimes (1996)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOf all the winners, only three have been country artists.

In 2020, Rosalía became the first all Spanish-language artist to be nominated. 2021 marked the first time that multiple female rappers were nominated in the same year, when Chika, Doja Cat and Megan Thee Stallion were all nominated, with the latter winning the award.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Year[I] | Image\n | Recipient\n | Nominees\n | Ref.\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2010 | ![](image) | Zac Brown Band | * Keri Hilson\n* MGMT\n* Silversun Pickups\n* The Ting Tings\n | [77] |\n| 2011 | ![](image) | Esperanza Spalding | * Justin Bieber\n* Drake\n* Florence and the Machine\n* Mumford & Sons\n | [78] |\n| 2012 | ![](image) | Bon Iver | * The Band Perry\n* J.
