The Knicks drafted center Willis Reed, who made an immediate impact on the court and was named NBA Rookie of the Year for his efforts.[24] However, the leaders of the team still remained in flux. In an attempt to reorganize, the Knicks named former standout Harry Gallatin as head coach while reassigning Donovan to general manager position.[33] After a slow start in 1965, Dick McGuire, another former Knick, replaced his former teammate Gallatin midway through the season.[30] Though he failed to guide the Knicks to the playoffs in 1965, he managed to do so the following season, however, the Knicks lost in the Eastern Division semi-finals.[30]\n\n\n\n### 1967–1975: championship years[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nWillis Reed and Walt \"Clyde\" Frazier, under coach Red Holzman, brought the Knicks two NBA Championships in the early 1970s\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe playoff-level Knicks of the 1990s were led by future Hall of Fame center Patrick Ewing; this era was marked by passionate rivalries with the Chicago Bulls, Indiana Pacers, and Miami Heat. During this time, they were known for playing tough defense under head coaches Pat Riley and Jeff Van Gundy, making NBA Finals appearances in 1994 and 1999. However, they were unable to win an NBA championship during this era.\n\n\nSince 2000, the Knicks have struggled to regain their former successes, but won their first division title in 19 years in 2012–13, led by a core of forwards Carmelo Anthony and Amar'e Stoudemire. They were eventually eliminated in the Eastern Conference semifinals by the Indiana Pacers, and had failed to make the playoffs for eight years until 2020–21 when they were led by forward Julius Randle and sophomore RJ Barrett, who was selected third overall in the 2019 NBA draft.[9]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of New York Knicks seasons\n\n### 1946–1967: early years[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Knicks' success continued for the next few years. After losing to the Bullets in the 1971 Eastern Conference finals, the team, aided by the acquisitions of Jerry Lucas and Earl \"The Pearl\" Monroe, returned to the Finals in 1972.[24] This time the Knicks fell to the Lakers in five games.[24] The next year, the results were reversed, as the Knicks defeated the Lakers in five games to win their second NBA title in four years.[42] The team had one more impressive season in 1973–74, as they reached the Eastern Conference finals, where they fell in five games to the Celtics.[43] It was after this season that Willis Reed announced his retirement, and the team's fortunes began to shift once more.[44]\n\n\n\n### 1975–1985: post-championship years[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)The current Madison Square Garden has been the home of the Knicks since 1968.\nDespite the loss of Ewing, the Knicks remained successful in the regular season, as they posted a 48–34 record under the direction of Houston and Sprewell.[73] In the first round of playoff contention, however, New York fell to the Toronto Raptors in five games, failing to get past the first round of the playoffs for the first time in a decade.[74] After a poor start to the season, the Knicks managed to get above .500 with a 10–9 record.[75] In spite of their recent success, Van Gundy unexpectedly resigned[76] as head coach on December 8, 2001, explaining he had \"lost focus\" and would no longer be able to properly coach the team.[77] The team, which named longtime assistant Don Chaney as their new head coach, ended the season with a 30–52 record, and for the first time since the 1986–87 season they did not qualify for the playoffs.[30][75]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Patrick Ewing played for the Knicks from 1985 to 2000, leading them to the Finals in 1994 and 1999\nIn the summer of 1985, the Knicks were entered into the first-ever NBA draft lottery.[52] The Knicks ended up winning the number one pick in that year's NBA draft. They used the pick to select star center Patrick Ewing of Georgetown University.[52] In Ewing's first season with the Knicks, he led all rookies in scoring (20 points per game) and rebounds (9 rebounds per game), and he won the NBA Rookie of the Year Award.[53] The team would not fare as well, though, as they struggled to a 23–59 record in his first season.[30]\n\n\nDuring Ewing's second season, the team started with a 4–12 record and head coach Hubie Brown was dismissed in favor of assistant Bob Hill.[54] Under Hill, the Knicks had brief successes but went on to lose seventeen of their twenty-one final games of the season to finish 20–46 under Hill and 24–58 on the season.[55][56] Hill was dismissed at season's end.[57]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n187. **^** Vertsberger, David (February 16, 2019). \"Is Mitchell Robinson the Knicks' best prospect?\". *SNY*.

The team defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers before facing the Pacers again in the second round. The tone for the Knicks–Pacers series was set in Game 1, as Miller once again became a clutch nuisance to the Knicks by scoring eight points in the final 8 seconds of the game to give the Pacers a 107–105 victory. The series went to a Game 7, and when Patrick Ewing's last-second finger roll attempt to tie the game missed, the Pacers clinched the 97–95 win.

The team plays its home games at Madison Square Garden, an arena they share with the New York Rangers of the National Hockey League (NHL).

Rookies Phil Jackson and Walt Frazier were named to the NBA All-Rookie Team while Dick Barnett and Willis Reed performed in the 1968 NBA All-Star Game.[24]\n\n\nThe following season, the team acquired Dave DeBusschere from the Detroit Pistons, and the team went 54–28.[30][37] In the playoffs, New York made it past the first round of contention for the first time since 1953, sweeping the Baltimore Bullets in four games, before falling to the Boston Celtics in the Eastern Division finals.[38]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Knicks started their 1967–68 season with a 124–122 win over the visiting Warriors.

With the acquisition of Kevin Garnett for 2007–08, the Celtics achieved a record single-season rise in win percentage to claim their first title in twenty-two seasons, in the process achieving the best average point differential between the 1995–96 Bulls and the 2015–16 Warriors.[1] The team remained a power until after the 2011 lockout, but lost to the Warriors in their most recent Finals appearance.\n\n\nThe Celtics are 27–9 all-time in seventh games of playoff series,[2] and 7–1 in Game 7 of the NBA Finals.\n\n\n\n## Seasons[edit]\n\n\n*Note: Statistics are correct as of the 2022–23 season.*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWith seventeen NBA Championships, the Celtics are tied with the Los Angeles Lakers for the most amongst all NBA franchises, while the 1959-to-1966 domination of the NBA Championship, with eight straight titles, is the longest consecutive championship winning streak of any major professional sport team to date. Following this, the Celtics had two major periods of success separated by quite poor seasons during rebuilding. Between 1971–72 and 1975–76 the Celtics, led by Dave Cowens and John Havlicek, won 294 of 410 regular season games and reached the conference finals in each of those five seasons, winning two more NBA championships, whilst between 1979–80 and 1987–88 led by the frontcourt of Larry Bird, Kevin McHale and Robert Parish the Celtics won 550 of 742 regular season games and reached every Conference Final except for 1982–83 when they were swept in the conference semifinals by the Milwaukee Bucks. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nBoston Celtics\n |\n| --- |\n| * Founded in **1946**\n* Based in **Boston, Massachusetts**\n |\n| Franchise | * History\n* All-time roster\n* Draft history\n* Accomplishments and records\n* Head coaches\n* Seasons\n* **Current season**\n |\n| Arenas | * Boston Arena\n* Boston Garden\n* Hartford Civic Center\n* **TD Garden**\n |\n| Personnel | Owner(s)\nBoston Basketball Partners\nPresident\nRich Gotham\nGeneral manager\nBrad Stevens\nHead coach\nJoe Mazzulla\n |\n| G League affiliate | * Maine Celtics\n |\n| Retired numbers | * 00\n* 1\n* 2\n* 3\n* 5\n* 6\n* 10\n* 14\n* 15\n* 16\n* 17\n* 18\n* 19\n* 21\n* 22\n* 23\n* 24\n* 25\n* 31\n* 32\n* 33\n* 34\n* 35\n* LOSCY\n* MIC\n |\n| NBA championships | * 1957\n* 1959\n* 1960\n* 1961\n* 1962\n* 1963\n* 1964\n* 1965\n* 1966\n* 1968\n* 1969\n* 1974\n* 1976\n* 1981\n* 1984\n* 1986\n* 2008\n |\n| Rivalries | * Detroit Pistons\n* Los Angeles Lakers\n* Miami Heat\n* New York Knicks\n* Philadelphia 76ers\n |\n| Culture and lore | * Broadcasters\n* Radio network\n* *Celtic Pride*\n* *Celtics/Lakers: Best of Enemies*\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThis is a list of seasons completed by the Boston Celtics of the National Basketball Association.
