Most of this growth is accounted for by a rapid increase in the number of Chinese Global 500 companies, of which there were 135 by 2021, increasing from only 10 in 2001.

In 1990, United States companies were added to compile a truly global list of top industrial corporations as ranked by sales. Since 1995, the list has had its current form, listing also top financial corporations and service providers by revenue.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Household Products | Procter & Gamble | ![United States](image) Cincinnati | 0154#154 | 76,118\n |\n| Industrials | Hengli Group | ![China](image) Suzhou | 0075#75 | 113,536\n |\n| Materials | China Baowu Steel Group | ![China](image) Shanghai | 0044#44 | 150,730\n |\n| Media | Walt Disney | ![United States](image) Burbank | 0183#183 | 67,418\n |\n| Motor Vehicles & Parts | Volkswagen | ![Germany](image) Wolfsburg | 0008#8 | 295,820\n |\n| Retailing | Walmart | ![United States](image) Bentonville | 0001#1 | 572,754\n |\n| Technology | Apple | ![United States](image) Cupertino | 0007#7 | 365,817\n |\n| Telecommunications | AT&T | ![United States](image) Dallas | 0032#32 | 168,864\n |\n| Transportation | China Post Group | ![China](image) Beijing | 0081#81 | 108,669\n |\n| Wholesalers | Trafigura Group | ![Singapore](image) Singapore | 0019#19 | 231,308\n |\n\n\n## *Fortune* Global 500 list of 2021[edit]\n\n\nThe following is the list of top 10 companies.[8]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs can be seen from the table above, 425 (85.0%) of the Global 500 are represented by only 10 countries: two in North America (Canada and United States), five in Western Europe (France, Germany, Netherlands, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom) and three in East Asia (China, Japan and South Korea).

In 1990, United States companies were added to compile a truly global list of top industrial corporations as ranked by sales. Since 1995, the list has had its current form, listing also top financial corporations and service providers by revenue.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Household Products | Procter & Gamble | ![United States](image) Cincinnati | 0154#154 | 76,118\n |\n| Industrials | Hengli Group | ![China](image) Suzhou | 0075#75 | 113,536\n |\n| Materials | China Baowu Steel Group | ![China](image) Shanghai | 0044#44 | 150,730\n |\n| Media | Walt Disney | ![United States](image) Burbank | 0183#183 | 67,418\n |\n| Motor Vehicles & Parts | Volkswagen | ![Germany](image) Wolfsburg | 0008#8 | 295,820\n |\n| Retailing | Walmart | ![United States](image) Bentonville | 0001#1 | 572,754\n |\n| Technology | Apple | ![United States](image) Cupertino | 0007#7 | 365,817\n |\n| Telecommunications | AT&T | ![United States](image) Dallas | 0032#32 | 168,864\n |\n| Transportation | China Post Group | ![China](image) Beijing | 0081#81 | 108,669\n |\n| Wholesalers | Trafigura Group | ![Singapore](image) Singapore | 0019#19 | 231,308\n |\n\n\n## *Fortune* Global 500 list of 2021[edit]\n\n\nThe following is the list of top 10 companies.[8]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs can be seen from the table above, 425 (85.0%) of the Global 500 are represented by only 10 countries: two in North America (Canada and United States), five in Western Europe (France, Germany, Netherlands, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom) and three in East Asia (China, Japan and South Korea).

In 1990, United States companies were added to compile a truly global list of top industrial corporations as ranked by sales. Since 1995, the list has had its current form, listing also top financial corporations and service providers by revenue.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Household Products | Procter & Gamble | ![United States](image) Cincinnati | 0154#154 | 76,118\n |\n| Industrials | Hengli Group | ![China](image) Suzhou | 0075#75 | 113,536\n |\n| Materials | China Baowu Steel Group | ![China](image) Shanghai | 0044#44 | 150,730\n |\n| Media | Walt Disney | ![United States](image) Burbank | 0183#183 | 67,418\n |\n| Motor Vehicles & Parts | Volkswagen | ![Germany](image) Wolfsburg | 0008#8 | 295,820\n |\n| Retailing | Walmart | ![United States](image) Bentonville | 0001#1 | 572,754\n |\n| Technology | Apple | ![United States](image) Cupertino | 0007#7 | 365,817\n |\n| Telecommunications | AT&T | ![United States](image) Dallas | 0032#32 | 168,864\n |\n| Transportation | China Post Group | ![China](image) Beijing | 0081#81 | 108,669\n |\n| Wholesalers | Trafigura Group | ![Singapore](image) Singapore | 0019#19 | 231,308\n |\n\n\n## *Fortune* Global 500 list of 2021[edit]\n\n\nThe following is the list of top 10 companies.[8]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs can be seen from the table above, 425 (85.0%) of the Global 500 are represented by only 10 countries: two in North America (Canada and United States), five in Western Europe (France, Germany, Netherlands, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom) and three in East Asia (China, Japan and South Korea).

On June 3, 2011, the *Atlanta Business Chronicle* stated examples of *Fortune* including regional headquarters for some cities, excluding regional headquarters for other cities and in some cases excluding headquarters that are physically located inside a city limit.[1]\n\n\n\n## Geographical distribution[edit]\n\n\nSince 2001, there has been significant change in the geographical distribution of the companies in the Global 500 rankings. Most of this growth is accounted for by a rapid increase in the number of Chinese Global 500 companies, of which there were 135 by 2021, increasing from only 10 in 2001. The share of European-based companies also declined, from 158 to 143, over the same period.[2][3][4]\n\n\n\n## *Fortune* Global 500 list of 2023[edit]\n\n\nThe following is the list of top 10 companies in 2023.[5]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThese are the top 10 countries with the highest revenues from the top 500 companies as of August 2023.[5]\n\n\n\n\n\nBreakdown by country\n| Rank\n | Country\n | Companies\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | ![](image)\u00a0China | 142\n |\n| 2\n | ![](image)\u00a0United States | 136\n |\n| 3\n | ![](image)\u00a0Japan | 41\n |\n| 4\n | ![](image)\u00a0France | 31\n |\n| 5\n | ![](image)\u00a0Germany | 27\n |\n| 6\n | ![](image)\u00a0South Korea | 18\n |\n| 7\n | ![](image)\u00a0United Kingdom | 15\n |\n| 8\n | ![](image)\u00a0Canada | 14\n |\n| 9\n | ![](image)\u00a0\u00a0Switzerland | 11\n |\n| 10\n | ![](image)\u00a0Netherlands | 10\n |\n\n\n### Breakdown by region[edit]\n\n\nAs of August\u00a02023[update], 28 (6%) of the Fortune Global 500 companies are located outside East Asia, North America, and Europe.[6]\n\n\n\n\n\nBreakdown by region\n| Region\n | Companies\n | Global share\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| East Asia | 208\n | 42%\n |\n| North America | 153\n | 31%\n |\n| Europe | 118\n | 24%\n |\n| Rest of world | 21\n | 4%\n |\n\n\n### Leadership by sector[edit]\n\n\nThe following are the top-ranked companies in 2023 for each sector.[5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n9. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** \"Global 500\". *Fortune*.

In 1990, United States companies were added to compile a truly global list of top industrial corporations as ranked by sales.
