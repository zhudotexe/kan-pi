Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, many former Warsaw Pact and post-Soviet states sought to join NATO. Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic became NATO members in 1999, amid much debate within NATO itself and Russian opposition. NATO then formalized the process of joining the organization with \"Membership Action Plans\", which aided the accession of seven Central and Eastern Europe countries shortly before the 2004 Istanbul summit: Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia. Two countries on the Adriatic Sea\u2014Albania and Croatia\u2014joined on 1 April 2009 before the 2009 Strasbourg\u2013Kehl summit. The next member states to join NATO were Montenegro on 5 June 2017, and North Macedonia on 27 March 2020.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs NATO Secretary General Willy Claes noted, the 1995 study did not specify the \"who or when,\"[100] though it discussed how the then newly formed Partnership for Peace and North Atlantic Cooperation Council could assist in the enlargement process,[101] and noted that on-going territorial disputes could be an issue for whether a country was invited.[102] At the 1997 Madrid summit, the heads of state of NATO issued the \"Madrid Declaration on Euro-Atlantic Security and Cooperation\" which invited three Central European countries to join the alliance, out of the twelve that had at that point requested to join, laying out a path for others to follow.[98] The text of Article 10 was the origin for the April 1999 statement of a \"NATO open door policy\".[103]\n\n\n\n### Membership Action Plan[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n103. **^** \"NATO's Open Door Policy\" (PDF).

The process of joining the alliance is governed by Article 10 of the North Atlantic Treaty, which allows for the invitation of \"other European States\" only and by subsequent agreements. Countries wishing to join must meet certain requirements and complete a multi-step process involving political dialog and military integration. The accession process is overseen by the North Atlantic Council, NATO's governing body. NATO was formed in 1949 with twelve founding members and has added new members nine times. The first additions were Greece and Turkey in 1952. In May 1955, West Germany joined NATO, which was one of the conditions agreed to as part of the end of the country's occupation by France, the United Kingdom, and the United States, prompting the Soviet Union to form its own collective security alliance (commonly called the Warsaw Pact) later that month. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nUS President George W. Bush at the NATO Accession Ceremony for Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia\nAt the 1999 Washington summit NATO issued new guidelines for membership with individualized \"Membership Action Plans\" for Albania, Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, North Macedonia, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia in order to standardize the process for new members.[55] In May 2000, these countries joined with Croatia to form the Vilnius Group in order to cooperate and lobby for common NATO membership, and by the 2002 Prague summit seven were invited for membership, which took place at the 2004 Istanbul summit.[56] Slovenia had held a referendum on NATO the previous year, with 66% approving of membership.[57]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* NATO open door policy\n* Enlargement of the European Union\n* Withdrawal from NATO\n* Partnership for Peace\n* Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council\n* Major non-NATO ally\n* List of countries in Europe by military expenditures\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAs of 2023, four states have formally expressed their desire to join NATO. Bosnia and Herzegovina is the only country with a Membership Action Plan, which together with Georgia, were named NATO \"aspirant countries\" at the North Atlantic Council meeting on 7 December 2011.[116] Ukraine was recognized as an aspirant country after the 2014 Ukrainian revolution. In 2022, NATO signed protocols with Finland and Sweden on their accession following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Ukraine applied for membership in 2022. Finland joined NATO on 4 April 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn November 2002, NATO invited seven countries to join it via the MAP: Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia.[108] All seven invitees joined in March 2004, which was observed at a flag-raising ceremony on 2 April. After that date, NATO numbered 26 allies.[109] Other former MAP participants were Albania and Croatia between May 2002 and April 2009, Montenegro between December 2009 and June 2017, and North Macedonia between April 1999 and March 2020, when it joined NATO. As of 2022[update], there was only one country participating in a MAP, Bosnia and Herzegovina.[110]\n\n\n\n### Intensified dialogue[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n109. **^** \"NATO welcomes seven new members\".

As such, opposition to Soviet-style communism became a defining characteristic of the organization and the anti-communist governments of Greece, which had just fought a civil war against a pro-communist army, and Turkey, whose newly-elected Democrat Party were staunchly pro-American, came under internal and external pressure to join the alliance, which both did in February 1952.[7][8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Greece\n* Hungary\n* Iceland\n* Italy\n* Latvia\n* Lithuania\n* Luxembourg\n* Montenegro\n* Netherlands\n* North Macedonia\n* Norway\n* Poland\n* Portugal\n* Romania\n* Slovakia\n* Slovenia\n* Spain\n* Sweden\n* Turkey\n* United Kingdom\n* United States\n |\n| Multilateral relations | * Atlantic Treaty Association\n* Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council\n* Mediterranean Dialogue\n* Individual Partnership Action Plan\n* Istanbul Cooperation Initiative\n* Major non-NATO ally\n* NATO global partners\n* Open door policy\n* Partnership for Peace\n* Relationship with the European Union\n* Relationship with Russia\n\t+ eastward NATO expansion issues\n |\n| See also | * Baghdad Pact (METO/CENTO)\n* Balkan Pact\n* Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO)\n* Suwa\u0142ki Gap\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nRussian invasion of Ukraine\n |\n| --- |\n| Part of the Russo-Ukrainian War\n |\n| \n\n| Overview\n |\n| --- |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n127. **^** \"Finland and Sweden submit applications to join NATO\". *NATO*. 18 May 2022.

The country's current constitution was adopted in 1994, and forbids the country from joining a military alliance, but some politicians, such as former Moldovan Minister of Defence Vitalie Marinu\u021ba, have suggested joining NATO as part of a larger European integration. Moldova joined NATO's Partnership for Peace in 1994, and initiated an Individual Partnership Action Plan in 2010.[279] Moldova also participates in NATO's peacekeeping force in Kosovo.[280] Following the 2014 annexation of Crimea by Russia, NATO officials warned that Russia might seek to annex Transnistria, a breakaway Moldovan region.[281] This separatist issue could preclude Moldova from joining NATO.[279]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n234. **^** Leichtenstein, Stephanie (12 February 2023). \"Neutral Austria under pressure to get tougher on Russia\". *Associated Press*.
