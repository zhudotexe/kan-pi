Many universities were established at institutes of learning such as schools and colleges that may have been founded significantly earlier but were not classed as universities upon their foundation; this is normally described in the notes for that institution. In some countries (particularly the US and those influenced by its culture), degree-granting higher education institutions that would normally be called universities are instead called colleges. In this case, both the oldest institution that would normally be regarded as a university and the oldest institution (if different) to actually be called a university are given. In many parts of the world, the first university to have a presence was an institution based elsewhere (often the University of London via the affiliation of a local college); where this is different from the first locally established university, both are given.\n\n\n\n### Africa[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | Founded by Alfonso V of Aragon on 3 September 1450 as the *Estudi General de Barcelona*.

In 1189 the masters made an agreement with the commune not to transfer the *studium* to another town, while the Lombard students were organised into a 'nation' by 1191.[16][19] |\n| 1200\u20131214[20](teaching from c. 1096)\n | University of Oxford | ![](image)\u00a0Kingdom of England | ![United Kingdom](image) Oxford, United Kingdom\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 1475[5] | University of Copenhagen | ![](image)\u00a0Kingdom of Denmark within the  ![](image)\u00a0Kalmar Union | ![Denmark](image) Copenhagen, Denmark\n |  |\n| 1476[5] | Eberhard Karls University of T\u00fcbingen | ![](image)\u00a0Holy Roman Empire | ![Germany](image) T\u00fcbingen, Germany\n |  |\n| 1477[5] | Uppsala University | ![](image) Kingdom of Sweden within the  ![](image)\u00a0Kalmar Union | ![Sweden](image) Uppsala, Sweden\n | Established in 1477 by the Catholic Archbishop Jakob Ulvsson.

The university spent approximately \u20ac529\u00a0M in payroll costs and approximately \u20ac326\u00a0M in other expenditures.[81] Additionally, the university receives another \u20ac150\u00a0M in research grants, distributed over 5 years from 2012 onwards, due to the German Universities Excellence Initiative. In the fiscal year 2007, the university for the first time raised approximately \u20ac19\u00a0M through tuition fees, exclusively to further improve the conditions of study. Only approximately \u20ac9.5\u00a0M of these were spent at the end of the year and the rectorate had to urge the faculties to make use of their additional means.[82]\n\n\n\n### Research[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe German Students Association exerted great influence, which was at first patriotic and later political. After Romanticism had eventually died out, Heidelberg became a center of Liberalism and the movement in favor of German national unity.[28] The historians Friedrich Christoph Schlosser and Georg Gottfried Gervinus were the guides of the nation in political history. The modern scientific schools of medicine and natural science, particularly astronomy, were models in point of construction and equipment, and Heidelberg University was especially noted for its influential law school.[31] The university as a whole became the role model for the transformation of American liberal arts colleges into research universities, in particular for the then-newly established Johns Hopkins University.[32] Heidelberg's professors were important supporters of the Vorm\u00e4rz revolution and many of them were members of the first freely elected German parliament, the Frankfurt Parliament of 1848. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n98. **^** \"Cluster of Excellence \u2013 Asia and Europe\".

However, from spring term 2012 onwards, tuition fees have been abolished.[79] The usual housing costs for on-campus dormitories range from \u20ac2,200 to \u20ac3,000 p.a.[80]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)The Bergheim Campus houses Economics and the Social Sciences.\nThe Bergheim Campus is located in the former Ludolf Krehl clinic (named after Ludolf von Krehl) in the inner-city suburb of Heidelberg-Bergheim. Since March 2009 it has housed the institutes economics, political science, and sociology (together the Heidelberg University Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences) that formerly resided at the Old Town campus. The Bergheim campus offers one lecture theatre, several seminar rooms, the most modern of the university libraries, and a cafe (rather than the full cafeteria present in the other campuses).

It attracted scholars from all over the continent and developed into a cultural and academic center.[28] However, with the beginning of the Thirty Years' War in 1618, the intellectual and fiscal wealth of the university declined. In 1622, the then-world-famous Bibliotheca Palatina (the library of the university) was stolen from the University Cathedral and taken to Rome. The reconstruction efforts thereafter were defeated by the troops of King Louis XIV, who destroyed Heidelberg in 1693 almost completely.[29][30]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAccording to the funding report of the German Research Foundation (DFG) of 2018, which breaks down the grants from 2014 to 2016, the Heidelberg University ranked 2nd among German universities in the overall ranking, 7th in humanities and social sciences and 4th among German universities in the life sciences and natural sciences. The approvals were normalised to the size of the university. In a competitive selection process, the DFG selects the best research projects from researchers at universities and research institutes and finances them. The ranking is thus regarded as an indicator of the quality of research.[63]\n\n\nIn the Performance Ranking of Scientific Papers for World Universities (NTU ranking) 2019, which measures the research outputs of universities, Heidelberg University is ranked 1st in Germany and 5th in Continental Europe.[64]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

In winter term 2017, out of its 28,797 students about 11% (3,174) were foreign students.[31]\n\n\n\n## Student life[edit]\n\n\nLeipzig has a thriving student life with a large number of student run bars, sports clubs and recreational facilities for students. The student body in Leipzig is diverse, not only due to the broad spectrum of subjects at the university but also because of the other higher education institutions in the city. The Moritzbastei is the largest student club in Germany, it is part of the historic city fortifications of Leipzig and is famous for its atmosphere and large number of cultural events.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2008 the university was able to prevail in the nationwide \"Initiative of Excellence\" of Germany and it was granted the graduate school \"BuildMoNa: Leipzig School of Natural Sciences \u2013 Building with Molecules and Nano-objects\".[7] In addition, the university was able to receive grants from the Saxon excellence initiative for the \"Life\" project \u2013 a project that tries to explore common diseases more effectively. Also in 2008 the \"Bach Archive\" was associated with the university. In 2009, the Leipzig University celebrated its 600th anniversary with over 300 scientific and cultural lectures and exhibitions,[8] reflecting the role of the university's research and teaching from its beginning.\n\n\n\n## Campus[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring the first centuries, the university grew slowly and was a rather regional institution. This changed, however, during the 19th century when the university became a world-class institution of higher education and research.[*citation needed*] At the end of the 19th century, important scholars such as Bernhard Windscheid (one of the fathers of the German Civil Code) and Wilhelm Ostwald (viewed as a founder of modern physical chemistry) taught at Leipzig.\n\n\n\n![](image)Formerly organized as a collegiate university, the Red College of Leipzig University was established in the 16th century.\nLeipzig University was one of the first German universities to allow women to register as \"guest students\".[3] At its general assembly in 1873, the Allgemeiner Deutscher Frauenverein\u00a0[de] thanked the University of Leipzig and Prague for allowing women to attend as guest students. This was the year that the first woman in Germany obtained her JD, Johanna von Evreinov.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Institute for International Law, European Law and Foreign Public Law (InVEA) of the Leipzig University\n\n\n## Academics[edit]\n\n\nToday, the university has 14 faculties. With over 29,000 students, it is Saxony's second-largest university. There are now more than 150 institutes and the university offers 190 study programs leading to Bachelor's degrees, Master's degrees, Staatsexamen, Diplom (equivalent to master's degree)[22] and Ph.D.s.\n\n\n\nThe university offers a number of courses in English and other foreign languages, and there are several programs which have been specially designed for foreign students. Exchange partner universities include the universities of Arizona, Oklahoma, Houston, Alberta, Ohio, and Edinburgh. Traditionally contacts to universities in Eastern Europe and the Far East are strong as well, e.g. there are cooperations with leading institutions such as Moscow's Lomonosov University and Renmin University in Beijing.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n5. **^** \"A Jewish Palestinian's quest to receive his degree, from Nazi Germany\". wn.com.

In the field of sports, the university offers training opportunities and courses in almost all disciplines. During the annual Leipzig book fair, the university library and other university institutions organise public events for authors.\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Leipzig University people\n\n![](image)Johann Sebastian Bach\n![](image)Tycho Brahe![](image)Johann Wolfgang von Goethe\n![](image)Gottfried Leibniz\n![](image)Angela Merkel\n![](image)Friedrich Nietzsche\nLeipzig University has produced many notable individuals and noble laureates.

It was demolished by the socialist administration in 1968.\nThe university was modelled on the University of Prague, from which the German-speaking faculty members withdrew to Leipzig after the Jan Hus crisis and the Decree of Kutn\u00e1 Hora. The *Alma mater Lipsiensis* opened in 1409, after it had been officially chartered by Pope Alexander V in his *Bull of Acknowledgment* on (9 September of that year). Its first rector was Johannes Otto von M\u00fcnsterberg. From its foundation, the Paulinerkirche served as the university church. After the Reformation, the church and the monastery buildings were donated to the university in 1544. In order to secure independent and sustainable funding, the university was endowed with the lordship over nine villages east of Leipzig (university villages). It kept this status for nearly 400 years until land reforms were carried out in the 19th century. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Bibliotheca Albertina at Beethovenstra\u00dfe 6\n* Campus Library at Universit\u00e4tsstr. 3\n* Library of Deutsches Literaturinstitut at W\u00e4chterstr. 34\n* Library of Arts at Dittrichring 18\u201320\n* Library of Musicology at Neumarkt 9\u201319\n* Library of Law at Burgstr. 27\n* Library of Medicine at Johannisallee 34\n* Library of Medicine at K\u00e4the-Kollwitz-Str. 82\n* Library of Veterinary Medicine at the Tierkliniken 5\n* Library of Biosciences at Talstr. 35\n* Library of Chemistry and Physics at Johannisallee 29\n* Library of Earth Sciences at Talstr. 35\n* Library of Geography at Johannisallee 19\n* Library of Archaeology, Prehistory and Ancient History at Ritterstr. 14\n* Library of Oriental Studies at Schillerstr. 6\n* Library of Sports Science at Jahnallee 59\n\n\nIn addition to the university library, one of the two centers of the German National Library is based at Leipzig, the collections of which are open to use for academic research.\n\n\n\n## Faculties[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Leipzig University** (German: *Universit\u00e4t Leipzig*), in Leipzig in Saxony, Germany, is one of the world's oldest universities and the second-oldest university (by consecutive years of existence) in Germany. The university was founded on 2 December 1409 by Frederick I, Elector of Saxony and his brother William II, Margrave of Meissen, and originally comprised the four scholastic faculties. Since its inception, the university has engaged in teaching and research for over 600 years without interruption.\n\n\nFamous alumni include Angela Merkel, Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Leopold von Ranke, Friedrich Nietzsche, Robert Schumann, Richard Wagner, Tycho Brahe, Georgius Agricola. The university is associated with ten Nobel laureates, most recently with Svante P\u00e4\u00e4bo who won the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 2022.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Memorial stone to the foundation of Leipzig University\n### Founding and development until 1900[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the field of anthropology, the university is cooperating with the Leipzig Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology. In 1995, the Leibniz-Institute for Jewish History and Culture named after Simon Dubnow was formed as a research institution related to the university. Since 2008 the university is also home to one of Germany's few Confucius Institutes. The institute is based on an agreement of June 2006 between the university administration and representatives of the Chinese Embassy to establish a Confucius Institute in cooperation with the Renmin University and the \"National Office for Teaching Chinese as a Foreign Language\". Leipzig University has been the home of the first German chair for Chinese and East Asian Languages in the 19th century, which later became the Institute of East Asian Studies, which still exists today (see Georg von der Gabelentz).\n\n\n### Rankings[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| University rankings |\n| --- |\n| Overall \u2013 Global & National |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe university's urban campus comprises several locations. All in all, the university is spread across 38 locations in Leipzig. The main buildings in the city center (district Mitte) are still located on the same land plots as the earliest university buildings in 1409. The university's buildings in the center of Leipzig underwent substantial reconstruction from 2005, the new university's main building being drafted by Dutch architect Erick van Egeraat. The estimated total cost for the renovation project is 140 million euros. The new buildings were scheduled to be completed in 2009/2010, in time for the university's 600th anniversary celebrations.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Anatomy auditorium of the Faculty of MedicineThere are several International Master's programs: American Studies, Global Studies, Sustainable Development Studies, SEPT[23] (MBA in SME Promotion)[24] and one Bachelor/Master's/Ph.D. program (International Physics Studies Program[25]) taught in English. American Studies Leipzig was awarded three international professorships: The Fulbright-Leipzig Chair for American Studies, the DAAD Professorship for American and International Studies, and the Picador Guest Professorship for Literature.[26] It is also the home of *Aspeers \u2013 Emerging voices in American Studies*, a graduate-level peer-reviewed scholarly journal for American studies.

It is one of the oldest German university libraries and it serves as a source of literature and information for the Leipzig University as well as the general public in the region. Its extensive historical and special collections are nationally and internationally recognized. The library consists of the main building \"Bibliotheca Albertina\" and forty branches situated near their respective academic institutions. The current stock comprises 5 million volumes and about 7,700 periodicals. Collections range from important medieval and modern manuscripts to incunabula, papyri, autographs, ostraka and coins.\n\n\nThe Apel Codex, a manuscript of 16th century music, is housed in the Leipzig University library,[11] as well as the Papyrus Ebers.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLike many European universities, the University of Leipzig was structured into colleges (*collegia*) responsible for organising accommodation and collegiate lecturing. Among the colleges of Leipzig were the Small College, the Large College, the Red College (*Rotes Kolleg*, also known as the New College), the college of our Lady (*Frauenkolleg*) and the Pauliner-College (*Pauliner Kolleg*). There were also private residential halls (*bursen*, see English 'bursaries'). The colleges had jurisdiction over their members. The college structure was abandoned later[*timeframe?*] and today only the names survive.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ***QS* World** 2024[27] |  479 |  29 |\n| ***THE* World**[*citation needed*] |  |  |\n| ***ARWU* World** 2023[28] |  201-300 |  10-19 |\n| ***QS* Europe**[*citation needed*] |  |  |\n| ***QS* Employability**[*citation needed*] |  |  |\n| ***THE* Employability**[*citation needed*] |  |  |\n\n |\n\n\nLeipzig University is recognized in several university ranking systems.

In 1948 the freely elected student council was disbanded and replaced by Free German Youth members. The chairman of the Student Council, Wolfgang Natonek, and other members were arrested and imprisoned, but the university was also a nucleus of resistance. Thus began the Belter group, with flyers for free elections. The head of the group, Herbert Belter, was executed in 1951 in Moscow. The German Democratic Republic was created in 1949, and in 1953 for Karl Marx Year the university was renamed by its government the **Karl Marx University, Leipzig** after Karl Marx. In 1968, the partly damaged Augusteum, including Johanneum and Albertinum and the intact Paulinerkirche, were demolished to make way for a redevelopment of the university, carried out between 1973 and 1978. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe university was kept open throughout World War II, even after the destruction of its buildings. During the war the acting rector, Erich Maschke, described the continuation of the university in a memo on 11 May 1945, announcing the vote for a new rector:\n\n\n\n\n> Since 4 December 1943 a fixed determination not to abandon the Leipzig University in the most difficult hour of its more than five-hundred-year history has bonded the professors with each other and with the students. The special task of repairing the damage caused by air attacks has now broadened out to the more general duty to save the continuity of our university and preserve its substance, at the very least its indestructible kernel, through the crisis that has now reached its fullest stage. After the destruction of most of the buildings and the majority of its libraries, this kernel is represented by the professoriate alone. This is what must be preserved as the great repository of value in the university.[6]\n> \n> \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Bonn\n* Cologne\n* TU Dortmund\n* Duisburg-Essen\n* D\u00fcsseldorf\n* Hagen\n* M\u00fcnster\n* Paderborn\n* Siegen\n* Witten/Herdecke\n* Wuppertal\n |\n| Rhineland-Palatinate | * University of Kaiserslautern-Landau\n* University of Koblenz\n* Mainz\n* Speyer\n* Trier\n |\n| Saarland | * Saarland\n |\n| Saxony | * TU Chemnitz\n* TU Dresden\n* TU Freiberg\n* Leipzig\n |\n| Saxony-Anhalt | * Halle-Wittenberg\n* Magdeburg\n |\n| Schleswig-Holstein | * Flensburg\n* Kiel\n* L\u00fcbeck\n |\n| Thuringia | * Erfurt\n* TU Ilmenau\n* Jena\n* Weimar\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nGerman U15\n |\n| --- |\n| * Free University of Berlin (FU Berlin)\n* Humboldt University Berlin (HU Berlin)\n* University of Bonn\n* University of Cologne\n* University of Freiburg\n* Goethe University Frankfurt\n* University of G\u00f6ttingen\n* University of Hamburg (UHH)\n* Heidelberg University\n* Leipzig University\n* University of Mainz\n* Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich (LMU)\n* University of M\u00fcnster (WWU)\n* University of T\u00fcbingen\n* University of W\u00fcrzburg\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWith the delivery of the University Tower to a private user, the university was forced to spread some faculties over several locations in the city. It controversially redesigned its historical centre at the Augustusplatz. In 2002, Behet Bonzio received the second prize in the architectural competition; a first prize was not awarded by the jury. A lobby with partial support of the provincial government called for the rebuilding of St. Paul's Church and Augusteum. This caused the resistance of the university leadership, the majority of the students and population of Leipzig. On 24 March 2004 a jury chose a design by Dutch architect Erick van Egeraat, which was well received by almost all parties. He recalls the outer form of the St. Paul's Church (today called Paulinum) and Augusteum, and abstracted the original building complex. Renovations began in the summer of 2005.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFaculty of Law\n* Ernst Jaeger Institute of Corporate Restructuring and Insolvency Law\n* Institute of Broadcasting Law\n* Institute of Energy and Regulatory Law\n* Institute of Environmental and Planning Law\n* Institute of Foreign and European Private and Procedural Law\n* Institute of German and International Law of Banking and Capital Markets\n* Institute of International Law\n* Institute of Labour and Social Law\n* Institute of Law and Politics\n* Institute of Public International Law, European Law and Foreign Public Law\n* Institute of Tax Law\n* Institute of the Foundations of Law\n* Institute of the Legal Profession\n\n\nFaculty of Life Sciences\n* Institute of Biochemistry\n* Institute of Biology\n* Wilhelm Wundt Institute for Psychology[15]\n\n\nFaculty of Mathematics and Computer Science\n* Institute of Computer Science\n* Institute of Mathematics\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Luo Gan, Chinese Politician, Member of the Politburo Standing Committee\n* Johann Major, German Lutheran theologian, a principal author of the so-called Leipzig Interim, and author of the Majoristic Controversy\n* Angela Merkel, first female German Chancellor\n* Hans-Dietrich Genscher, German politician, Foreign Minister and Vice Chancellor\n* Rudolph Sohm, lawyer and Church historian\n* Cai Yuanpei, president of Peking University and leading thinker in the early Chinese communist movement\n* Michelle Bachelet, first female President of Chile between 2006 and 2010\n* Selig Brodetsky, Israeli President of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem\n* Raila Amolo Odinga, Kenyan politician\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\n* Luz Long, German Olympic long-jumper, noted for his sportsmanship\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Handelshochschule Leipzig (HHL)\n* Leipzig school (sociology)\n* List of medieval universities\n* List of universities in Germany\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** \"Jahresbericht 2015\" (PDF). *Leipzig University* (in German). pp.\u00a053\u201359.

The university also boasts continued pre-eminence in its centuries-old traditions of research in the fields of philosophy, theology and philology. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe University of T\u00fcbingen was founded in 1477 by Count Eberhard V (Eberhard im Bart, 1445\u20131496), later the first Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg, a civic and ecclesiastic reformer who established the school after becoming absorbed in the Renaissance revival of learning during his travels to Italy. Its first rector was Johannes Nauclerus.\n\n\nIts present name was conferred on it in 1769 by Duke Karl Eugen who appended his first name to that of the founder.

Philipp Melanchthon (1497\u20131560), the prime mover in building the German school system and a chief figure in the Protestant Reformation, helped establish its direction. Among T\u00fcbingen's eminent students (and/or professors) have been the astronomer Johannes Kepler; the economist Horst K\u00f6hler (President of Germany); Joseph Ratzinger (Pope Benedict XVI), poet Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin, and the philosophers Friedrich Schelling and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. \"The T\u00fcbingen Three\" refers to H\u00f6lderlin, Hegel and Schelling, who were roommates at the T\u00fcbinger Stift. Theologian Helmut Thielicke revived postwar T\u00fcbingen when he took over a professorship at the reopened theological faculty in 1947, being made administrative head of the university and President of the Chancellor's Conference in 1951. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Sculpture *Urpferd* at campus *Morgenstelle*\nThe university's students make up roughly a third of the total population of T\u00fcbingen and the town's culture can seem to be largely dominated by them. As a result there is a slump of activity during university holidays, particularly over the summer when a large number of otherwise regular events are not happening.\n\n\nAround 30 *Studentenverbindungen*, the German type of fraternities, are associated with the university. While famous for their parties, public academic lectures and the yearly \"Stocherkahn-Rennen\" punting-boat race on the Neckar river, some of them are the subject of ongoing controversy surrounding alleged rightwing policial views, leading to strong criticism from leftist groups.[29] The university itself takes a neutral stance on this issue. However, all of T\u00fcbingen's fraternities distance themselves from the fraternities of the Deutsche Burschenschaft, which have been widely criticized as adhering to far-right principles.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs T\u00fcbingen has traditionally been home to one of the most prestigious law schools in Germany, alumni in the legal profession include at least 19 judges of the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany,[*citation needed*] the first female German judge at the European Court of Justice,[*citation needed*] an Advocate General at the European Court of Justice,[*citation needed*] as well as several judges at the Federal Court of Justice, the Federal Fiscal Court, and the Federal Labour Court.

Founded in 1419,[3][4][5] it is the third-oldest university in Germany. It is the oldest university in continental northern Europe and the Baltic Sea area,[5] and 8th oldest in Central Europe.[6] It was the 5th university established in the Holy Roman Empire.\n\n\nThe university has been associated with four Nobel laureates: Albrecht Kossel, Karl von Frisch, Otto Stern, and Walter H. Schottky. It is a member of the European University Association. According to a ranking published by *Times Higher Education* in 2018, it is the most beautiful university in Germany and the fourth most beautiful university in all of Europe.[7] The language of instruction is usually German and English for some postgraduate studies.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nExternal funding increased by 83\u00a0% between 2005 and 2010 alone and currently is above 47\u00a0million Euros per year. Over 500\u00a0million Euros have been invested in the university infrastructure since 1991, reaching 750\u00a0million Euros by 2015. The numbers of young people from Germany and of international students who choose Rostock as a place to study are increasing every year. As of today, students from at least 99 different countries have studied at Rostock. In 2007, the University of Rostock reorganized its research capacities into three profile lines: *Life, Light & Matter*, *Maritime Systems*, and *Aging of Individuals and Societies*. In 2010, a fourth profile was added, called *Knowledge \u2013 Culture \u2013 Transformation*.\n\n\n\n## Organization and structure[edit]\n\n\nLike many continental European universities, the University of Rostock is divided into academic faculties (German: *Fakult\u00e4t*). Those can be sub-divided into academic departments (German: *Institut*) and chairs (German: *Lehrstuhl*).\n\n\n\n### Faculties[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nARWU ranked University of Rostock among 101\u2013150 in Chemistry in the world in 2014.[16] In 2014, the CWTS Leiden Ranking ranked University of Rostock in the world as 269th in Natural Sciences, 336th in Life Sciences, 463rd in Medical Sciences, 449th in Mathematics, Computer Science and Engineering, and 245th in Cognitive Science.[17] According to the University Ranking by Academic Performance (URAP), Rostock University was ranked 224th worldwide in Chemistry in 2014.[18]\n\n\nThe CWTS Leiden Ranking ranked University of Rostock as 405th in 2014.[19]\n\n\nIn 2014, the Center for World University Rankings (CWUR) ranked University of Rostock as 481st in the world.[20]\n\n\nAccording to the University Ranking by Academic Performance (URAP), Rostock University was ranked as 34th in Germany and 428th in the world in 2014.[21]\n\n\n\n### Research[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the course of political struggles and due to pressure from the church, the university moved to Greifswald in 1437 and remained there until 1443. From 1487 to 1488 teaching took place in L\u00fcbeck. A few years after the city of Rostock, the university became Protestant in 1542. Henceforth, Humanism and Lutheranism were defining characteristics of the university.\n\n\nIn the 16th century, Rostock was the first university to teach Copernicanism, which was introduced by Professor Duncan Liddel.[8] After the Thirty Years' War (1618\u20131648), however, for about two centuries the University of Rostock played only a regional role. After the \"ownership\" of the university had moved from the city to the state (Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin) in 1827, however, things changed for the better. The second half of the 19th century saw generous building activity in Rostock's *alma mater* and the university soon regained its old reputation amongst German universities.\n\n\n\n### 1919 to present[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t+ Institute for Special Education Development and Rehabilitation\n\t+ Institute for Vocational Education\n\t+ Institute for English/American Studies\n\t+ Institute for German Studies\n\t+ Institute for Romance Studies\n\t+ Heinrich Schliemann Institute of Classical Studies\n\t+ Historical Institute\n\t+ Institute for Media Research\n\t+ Institute of Philosophy\n\t+ Institute of Sports Science\n\t+ Wossidlo Research Center for European Ethnology/Folklore\n\t+ Moritz Schlick Research Center\n\t+ Uwe Johnson Research Center\n\t+ Research and Documentation Center of the State of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania on the History of Dictatorships in Germany\n* **Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences**\n\t+ Institute of Business Administration\n\t+ Institute of Marketing and Services Research\n\t+ Institute of Sociology and Demography\n\t+ Institute of Political and Administrative Sciences\n\t+ Institute of Economics\n\n## Facilities[edit]\n\n\n### Rostock University Library[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Detail of the central building depicting the coat of arms of Mecklenburg-Schwerin\n![](image)Memorial stone to the foundation of Rostock University, quadrangle of Wittenberg University\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### 1419\u20131919[edit]\n\n\nThe university was founded in 1419 by confirmation of Pope Martin V and thus is one of the oldest universities in Northern Europe.\n\n\nIn Germany, there are only five universities that were founded earlier, while only Heidelberg and Leipzig operated continuously since then: Heidelberg (1386), Cologne (1388), Erfurt (1392/1994), W\u00fcrzburg (1402/1582) and Leipzig (1409).\nThat makes Rostock University the third oldest German university in continuous operation.\n\n\nThroughout the 15th and 16th centuries, the University of Rostock had about 400 to 500 students each year and was among the most important universities in Germany and Northern Europe at the time, with many of its students originating from the Low Countries, Scandinavia or other countries bordering the Baltic Sea.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn recent years, the University of Rostock has undergone significant conceptual and organisational changes, which included the bundling of competences and research activities in the interdisciplinary, cross-faculty departments of the Interdisciplinary Faculty. Scientific priorities of the faculties have improved by including the interdisciplinary-based research units: Collaborative Research Centres, Research Training Groups, and Research Units.[22]\n\n\nThe university cooperates with several independent research centres.

The Faculty of Law was closed in 1951, a Faculty of Agriculture was introduced in 1950 and in 1951 saw the opening of a Department of Shipbuilding (renamed Faculty of Technology in 1963). The University of Rostock was the first traditional university in Germany to open a technical faculty. In 1952, the Faculty of Aviation was opened, but eventually relocated to Dresden.\n\n\nIn 1976 the university was renamed Wilhelm-Pieck-Universit\u00e4t after Wilhelm Pieck, the first president of the German Democratic Republic.

As the fourth oldest university in present Germany, it was temporarily also the oldest university of the Kingdoms of Sweden (1648\u20131815) and Prussia (1815\u20131945), respectively. Approximately two-thirds of the 10,179[4] students are from outside the state, including international students from 90 countries all over the world. Due to the small-town atmosphere, the pronounced architectural presence of the alma mater across town, and the young, academic flair in the streets, Greifswald is often described as a \"university with a town built around it\" rather than a town with a university. Being a vast research community, the university aims at expanding its academic connections globally.[5]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### 1456\u20131600: Founding[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nUniversity of Greifswald\n |\n| --- |\n| Greifswald, Germany\n |\n| Divisions | * Arts & Humanities\n* Business and Law\n* Mathematics and Sciences\n* Greifswald Medical School\n* Theology\n | ![](image)\n |\n| Institutions | * Botanic Garden and Arboretum\n* University Hospital\n* University Library\n* Observatory\n* Ornithological Station Hiddensee\n |\n| Independent partners | * Friedrich Loeffler Institute\n* Max Planck Institute of Plasma Physics\n* Wendelstein 7-X\n |\n| Miscellaneous | * Bach Festival\n* Emausaurus\n* Greifswald International Students' Festival\n* Nordischer Klang\n |\n| Categories, lists | * University of Greifswald\n* Alumni\n* Staff\n* Wikimedia Commons\n* List of University of Greifswald people\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nUniversities and colleges in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern\n |\n| --- |\n| Universities | * University of Greifswald\n* University of Rostock\n |\n| Colleges | * Hochschule Wismar\n* Rostock University of Music and Theatre\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe buildings of the arts and humanities, law, business studies, and theology are scattered about the historic centre of the town of Greifswald.

For instance, 19th century lecture hall (\"auditorium maximum\") has been carefully restored,[11][12] just like the university's main administrative building and many other buildings in the historic center of town. A new campus for natural sciences (physics,[13] chemistry, biochemistry), medicine, IT and mathematics is under construction in the eastern part of the city. The new domiciles of Greifswald University Library, the departments of physics, biology and biochemistry have already been completed.

Partnerships with foreign universities to foster exchange of people (staff and students alike) and ideas is conducted in two different ways. Firstly, through official partnership agreements with foreign universities, which involves the entire university and most or all of her disciplines. Secondly, through contacts of professors, departments, and schools, which usually involves only one or few disciplines.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n27. **^** \"Biological Station Hiddensee \u2013 Faculty \u2013 University of Greifswald\". *biologie.uni-greifswald.de*.

This was possible due to the great commitment of Greifswald's lord mayor, Heinrich Rubenow, who was also to become the university's first rector, with the support of Duke Wartislaw IX of Pomerania and Bishop Henning Iven of the local St Nicolas' Cathedral. The founding took place in the local cathedral, which was later remodeled by Caspar David Friedrich and his brother and can still be visited today. The founding of the university was made possible by a decree that restricted teaching activity at the University of Rostock (founded 1419). Several professors left Rostock for Greifswald to continue their work there, where Heinrich Rubenow took the chance of establishing his own university. Originally, the university consisted of the four traditional divisions: Theology, Philosophy, Medicine and Law.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nStudent exchange from and to Greifswald is co-ordinated by the university's international office (**Akademisches Auslandsamt**). The University of Greifswald has signed several official partnership agreements with other universities to foster international co-operation through faculty and student exchange and academic co-operation.[30] In Northern Europe, the university has signed partnership agreements with universities in Denmark (\u00c5rhus, Holb\u00e6k), Finland (Joensuu and Kuopio), and Sweden (Lund). In Eastern Europe, partnership agreements have been signed with universities in the Czech Republic (Brno), Estonia (Tartu), Latvia (Riga), Lithuania (Vilnius, Klaipeda), Poland (Poznan, Szczecin), and Russia (Kaliningrad, Saint Petersburg). Exceptions are the University of Aberdeen as one of the ancient universities of Scotland, and the University of Padua in Italy.[31] The university has also signed various cooperation agreements with universities outside of Europe, e.g. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n45. **^** Referat 2.4. \"Zahlen & Fakten \u2013 Ernst-Moritz-Arndt-Universit\u00e4t Greifswald\".

The government-funded National Research Centre for Animal Disease on the Isle of Riems co-operates loosely with the university and is named *Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut* in honour of the university's former member of staff, Friedrich Loeffler.\n\n\nThe University of Greifswald owns a field station on the German island of Hiddensee.[27]\n\n\nScientists from the university names a species of freshwater snail, *Opacuincola gretathunbergae,* after the climate activist Greta Thunberg.[28]\n\n\n\n#### Theology[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)University of Greifswald, Old Campus\n![](image)The main building on 8 October 1956, a few days before the 500th anniversary celebrations of the university\nAll academic activities came to a halt towards the end of the Second World War, and the university was re-opened on 15 February 1946. The name of Ernst Moritz Arndt was initially removed but restored in 1954. Several organisational changes were made during the time of the GDR, most of which were revoked in the 1990s after the German Reunification.\n\n\n\n### 1990\u2013present: Germany[edit]\n\n\nFreedom of science as well as the autonomy and self-administration of the university were re-established. The Faculty of Law and Economics was re-opened from 1991 to 1993. Extensive renovation took place since 1990. The dinosaur Emausaurus was named after the acronym of the university (*E*rnst-*M*oritz-*A*rndt-*U*niversit\u00e4t Greifswald) in 1990.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBeginning in 1999, the University of Greifswald was among the first in Germany to welcome and introduce the international Bachelor/Master degree system as proposed by the Bologna declaration. The new system has replaced all former 4\u00bd-year \"Magister\" degrees in the arts and humanities and is set to replace the 4\u00bd-year \"Diplom\" formerly awarded in the sciences and in business too.\n\n\nIn 2006, the university celebrated its 550th anniversary with a large variety of events. The central ceremony \u2013 involving the re-opening of the university's renovated administrative building by President Horst K\u00f6hler of Germany, Queen Silvia of Sweden, and Minister President Harald Ringstorff of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern \u2013 took place on 17 October 2006.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the late Middle Ages the University of Greifswald was one of the most important centers of science in the Duchy of Pomerania. The rest of Pomeranian schools \u2013 including those in Szczecin and Stargard \u2013 did not have the university status in this time. Nowadays in Germany, there are only three older universities by count of the years of existence: the University of Heidelberg (established 1386), the University of Leipzig (1409), and the University of Rostock (1419).\n\n\nInternational co-operation with other institutions of higher education in northern Europe existed already in the earliest years, sparked and accelerated by the transnational trading network Hanse. From 1456 until 1526, 476 Scandinavians were enrolled at Greifswald University and 22 faculty members as well as six rectors came from Scandinavia. This was a relatively high percentage compared to the total number of students at the time. Sources suggest a relatively segregated life of Swedish students in the primarily German university though.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the autumn of 2009, there were 12,500 students enrolled in Greifswald, i.e. a quarter of the town's total population of 53,000 were students. According to a 2008 study, Greifswald is Germany's 'youngest city',[44] having the highest percentage of households by people under 30 years of age. In 2008, 59.4 percent of all students were female, the remaining male. Two-thirds of the enrolled students in 2009 came to Greifswald from outside the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, and 5.3 percent were foreign nationals.[45]\n\n\n\n## Student life[edit]\n\n\nGreifswald is situated in close proximity to the sea (near the islands R\u00fcgen and Usedom), about 200\u00a0km to the north of Germany's capital city, Berlin, and 100\u00a0km east of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern's largest city, Rostock. There are train connections, and high-speed autobahn links to Hamburg, Rostock, and Berlin.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of University of Greifswald people, Category:University of Greifswald alumni, and Category:Academic staff of the University of Greifswald\n\n![](image)Prince Bernhard von B\u00fclow\u2014Chancellor of the German Empire from 1900 to 1909\u2014Emperor Wilhelm II of Germany, and Rudolf von Valentini (left to right) on board *SMY Hohenzollern* in 1908\n![](image)Johannes Bugenhagen (1485\u20131558) \u2013 religious reformer in North Germany, Denmark and Norway; friend of Martin Luther.\nThe University of Greifswald is associated with a number of notable people, including both former students and faculty.

Notable theologians have studied or worked here, for example Johannes Bugenhagen who was a close friend of Martin Luther.\n\n\n\n### Library[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The new library is one of the constituent buildings of Greifswald University Library.\nGreifswald University Library traces its roots back to the year 1456. In 1604, the first centralised university library in Germany was founded in Greifswald. Today, there are two main libraries, the Central University Library is situated on the Beitzplatz Campus and the Departmental Library can be found on the Loefflerstra\u00dfe Campus. In addition to the main libraries, several departments and institutes have their own libraries (German: *Fachbibliothek*).\n\n\n\n### Academic year[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAs a consequence of the construction of the new Greifswald University Hospital building, all historic 19th and early 20th century buildings that were formerly used by the hospital will be transferred to house other disciplines, thus creating an old-town campus for such departments as law and economics, the humanities and social sciences, and improving research and teaching considerably. As one of only 17 out of a total of 52 proposed building projects of \"national significance\" across Germany, the national government has agreed to subsidise the construction of a new pharmacology research lab (in Germany, education is usually cared for by the German states and not by the national government, which only supports a few projects of national and international importance).[14]\n\n\nFounded in 2000, the Alfried-Krupp Kolleg promotes the Universities international relations by awarding fellowships to Junior and Senior Fellows.[15]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter the Peace of Westphalia in 1648 the western part of Pomerania, including Greifswald and its university, became a fief held by Sweden. From 1806 to 1815 it was formally a part of Sweden. Without entirely losing its character as a German university, it was heavily influenced by Swedish educational policies until 1815. Especially during the second half of the eighteenth century Greifswald was a cultural and scientific bridge between Germany and Sweden. More than 1,500 Swedes studied at Greifswald University.\n\n\nThe first university course in the English language in Germany was held in Greifswald in the year 1777.\n\n\nThe main administrative building \u2013 still in use today \u2013 was built during the \"good old Swedish years\" by Andreas Mayer, a mathematician by profession, in the style of North German Baroque.\n\n\n\n### 1815\u20131933: Prussia[7][edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFollowing debates about the appropriateness of having the university named after Ernst Moritz Arndt, in January 2017 the Senate voted to remove his name from the official name of the university.[16] Although the State of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern declared this decision void, a compromise was reached in which Arndt's name is removed from the official name, but can still be used under certain circumstances. As of June 2018 the name \"Ernst-Moritz-Arndt Universit\u00e4t Greifswald\" is no longer in use.[17]\n\n\n\n## Organisation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The *Universit\u00e4tshauptgeb\u00e4ude* (university main building) \u2013 the seat of the rector and the administration\n### Central governance[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Scientists at the Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Plasmaphysik in Garching and Greifswald are researching fusion reactor technology and are constructing Wendelstein 7-X.\n### Admission[edit]\n\n\nA number of subjects at the University of Greifswald are among the most selective in Germany for undergraduate admissions (e.g. see here for the medical school). A number of other subjects such as the languages and cultures of Northern Europe and the Eastern Europe, philosophy, European history, physics, biochemistry, fine arts, church music have also continually achieved national and international recognition.\n\n\nMoreover, the University of Greifswald is frequently described as one of the most popular universities for undergraduate admission in Germany, which is due to a very good study environment as well as a co-operative spirit between the teaching staff and students.[35] Due to its small size, with only 10,179 students,[36] the university is comparable to other small universities such as St Andrews or Yale.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs is customary at German universities, students are generally required to arrange for their own housing. There are a few low-rate student dorms in the town, however a large majority of students share private flats with a couple of other students (German: *Wohngemeinschaft*, abbreviated *WG*), or live in single apartments. In recent years, it has become increasingly difficult for newly matriculated students to find appropriate flats in Greifswald, which is due to a growing number of students and a stagnating market. As landlords often prefer their prospective tenants to be fluent in German, this may cause disadvantages for international students wishing to rent their own place. However, the university usually arranges dorm rooms for international students.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)The renowned Romanticist painter Caspar David Friedrich immortalised the city in several of his paintings, e.g. *Wiesen bei Greifswald* (English: 'meadows near Greifswald'; 1820\u20131822, oil on canvas).\n![](image)The *Rubenow-Denkmal* (Rubenow Memorial) was erected in 1856 for celebration of the 400th anniversary of the university in honour of its founder and first rector, Heinrich Rubenow.\nWhen Swedish Pomerania became part of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1815, the University of Greifswald became the oldest university on Prussian territory. Prussia recognised the potential of science and universities, thus extensive building activity and growing financial support enabled the University of Greifswald to grow further both in size and reputation.\n\n\nIn 1856, on the occasion of the 400th anniversary of the university's founding, a monument was unveiled in the presence of King Frederick William IV of Prussia. The monument is still at its place, and was carefully restored for the 550th anniversary in 2006.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe university's *Hochschulsport*[47] (college sports) offers a wide range of opportunities to students who wish to do sports. Courses are available in nearly all disciplines, for instance aerobics, American football, football (soccer), dragon boat, fencing, handball, judo, karate, canoeing, lacrosse, rugby, surfing, diving, taekwondo, tennis, table tennis, volleyball or yoga. The regular local sports clubs are frequented by students, too.\n\n\nGreifswald is situated near the sea and the area between isles of R\u00fcgen and Usedom is among the most picturesque and best sailing and yachting regions in the whole of Germany. It is renowned for its steady winds.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs is customary in Germany, the academic year is divided into two semesters. The \"winter term\" (*Wintersemester*) lasts from October to March, and the \"summer term\" (*Sommersemester*) from April to September.[29] During the winter term, teaching usually takes place from mid-October to the end of January \u2013 the remainder being reserved for exams and the writing of term papers. Teaching during the summer term lasts from mid-April to mid-July.[29]\n\n\n\n## Cooperation[edit]\n\n\nAside from teaching and research, one of major tasks of the university is cooperation with partners outside the actual university.\n\n\n\n### Research partners[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Alfried Krupp Institute of Advanced Study (left)\nThe university's research emphasis lies in the field of plasma physics, landscape ecology, medicine, biotechnology, the Middle Ages and the languages and cultures of countries bordering the Baltic Sea.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nGreifswald has a number of different student fraternities and sororities, which are called *Studentenverbindungen* (the singular is *Studentenverbindung*). *Studentenverbindungen* have a long tradition as most of them were founded in the 19th century, and they are to some extent comparable to the fraternities in the United States. As traditional symbols (couleur) corporation members wear coloured caps and ribbons at ceremonial occasions (Kommers) and some still practice the traditional academic fencing, a kind of duel, in order to \"shape their members for the challenges of life\". In the 19th and early 20th century, corporations played an important role in Germany's student life. Today, however, corporations include only a relatively small number of students. Their self-declared mission is to keep academic traditions alive and to create friendships for life. The political views of the fraternities are more or less conservative, but two of them (Rugia and Markomannia) have been linked to the far-right NPD.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
