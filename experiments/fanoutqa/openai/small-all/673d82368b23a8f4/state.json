It is operated by the New York City Department of Education. Admission to Bronx Science involves passing the Specialized High Schools Admissions Test. \n\n\nFounded in 1938 in the Bronx, New York City, Bronx Science is located in what is now Kingsbridge Heights, also known as Jerome Park, a neighborhood in the northwest portion of the Bronx. Although originally known for its focus on mathematics and science, Bronx Science also emphasizes the humanities and social sciences and continually attracts students with a wide variety of interests beyond math and science. \n\n\nWith nine Nobel Prize-winning alumni, seven in physics, one in chemistry, and one in economics, it has produced the most Nobel laureates in science of any secondary school in the world. Bronx Science alumni have also won two Turing Awards, sometimes unofficially referred to as the Nobel Prize in computer science; six National Medals of Science, the nation's highest scientific honor; and eight Pulitzer Prizes.\n\n\nThe Bronx High School of Science is often called **Bronx Science**, **Bronx Sci**, **BX Sci**, and sometimes just **Science**.[3][4] It was formerly called **Science High** and its founder, Morris Meister, is said to have frequently called the school \"The High School of Science.\"[5]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The old Bronx Science logo\n![](image)The former Gothic building at Creston Avenue and 184th Street that housed the school from its founding in 1938 until 1959\n![](image)Dedication of the new building in 1957\nBronx High School of Science was founded in 1938 as a specialized science and math high school for boys, by resolution of the New York City Panel for Educational Policy, with Morris Meister as the first principal of the school. They were given use of an antiquated Gothic-gargoyled edifice located at Creston Avenue and 184th Street, in the Fordham Road-Grand Concourse area of the Bronx. The building, built in 1918 for Evander Childs High School, had been successively occupied by Walton High School (1930) and by an annex of DeWitt Clinton High School (1935). The initial faculty were composed in part by a contingent from Stuyvesant High School.[6]\n\n\nMeister put his imprint on the school from its formation, for example selecting as school colors \"green to represent chlorophyll and gold the sun, both of which are essential to the chain of life.\"[7]\n\n\nFrom the beginning, the Parents Association and Principal Morris Meister campaigned for a new building. The number of students exceeded the capacity of the building on 184th Street, so the top floor of Public School 85 on Marion Avenue and 187th Street was used as the \"Annex.\"[8]\n\n\n\n### 21st century[edit]\n\n\nAfter twenty years, plans were finally completed for a new $8 million building, which was designed by the architectural firm of Emery Roth and Sons.[9] The new building was on 205th Street near Bedford Park Boulevard, in a predominantly institutional area, between DeWitt Clinton High School and its large football field on one side, and Harris Field and Hunter College (now Lehman College) on the other. On March 3, 1959, students and faculty occupied the new building for the first time, solving the problem of how to move the books from the old library to the new in typical Bronx Science manner: on Friday afternoon each student took home five library books from the old building, and on Monday returned them to the new one.\n\n\nThey entered a school equipped with more modern classrooms, laboratories, and technical studio areas. The main lobby entrance featured a 63-foot (19\u00a0m), Venetian glass mosaic mural overhead, depicting major figures from the history of science such as Marie Curie and Charles Darwin under the protective hands of a God-like figure representing knowledge, with this quote from John Dewey: \"Every great advance in science has issued from a new audacity of imagination.\" The mural, *Humanities Protecting Biology, Physics, Chemistry*, is an original work by Frank J. Reilly. Legions of students over the years, bemoaning the lack of swimming facilities, have sarcastically referred to the mural as \"the Science swimming pool\", perpetuating the thesis that a choice was made to fund a mural rather than a pool in the new building.[10]\n\n\nIn the first spring of the move, rumors swept the school that various Bronx youth street gangs were coming to the school, and that the Fordham Baldies would shave the hair of Science students. This never happened. Another incident did happen that spring: The first time Science girls appeared on the outdoor physical education field in gym clothes, some students from the neighboring, all-male DeWitt Clinton High School charged the separation fence between their field and the Science field. The fence held, but the female students exercised indoors for the remainder of that year.\n\n\nWhen Bronx Science celebrated its silver anniversary in June 1963, President John F. Kennedy hailed it as \"a significant and pathfinding example of a special program devoted to the development of the student gifted in science and mathematics.\" Kennedy had recently selected a 1943 Bronx High School of Science graduate, Harold Brown, as Director of Defense Research and Engineering; Brown would later serve as United States Secretary of Defense under President Jimmy Carter.\n\n\n\n## Academics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bronx Science is the only specialized New York City high school with a campus\n![](image)A hallway on the first floor of Bronx Science\n![](image)A math and computer programming class at the school in 1960, featuring an IBM 650 op code chart (upper right). Bronx High School of Science was one of the first high schools to teach computer courses. The school had a keypunch machine, students ran their programs at the Watson lab at Columbia University, and the school obtained its own computer, an IBM 1620, a year and a half later.\nBronx Science students take a college preparatory curriculum that includes four years of science, English, and social studies; three (usually four) years of math; two or three years of foreign language; and a year of fine arts, with required courses and a wide selection of electives, including honors and advanced placement (AP) classes, which allow students to place out of introductory college science courses. Over 100 unique courses are offered. All New York State Regents classes are offered, with the exception of earth science.[11]\n\n\nIn the biological sciences, Bronx Science offers a special honors biology course, in addition to the Regents-level course, which includes additional laboratory exposure and intensive content. If students have already taken the Living Environment regents in 8th grade, they may take Regents-level or honors chemistry in freshman year. All students must take at least one year of a biological lab science at Bronx Science, a requirement that can be satisfied either by freshman biology or, if students took biology in middle school, one of the many advanced electives offered, including AP Biology, AP Environmental Science, AP Psychology; non-AP advanced courses include animal behavior, cell biology, epidemiology, forensic science, microbiology, neuroscience, and nutritional science. Post-AP level classes in evolution, genetics, and psychology are also offered. In the physical science department, AP Chemistry and AP Physics are both offered, and both may be taken alongside introductory Regents-level courses in those respective classes. Electives offered include astronomy and astrophysics, electrical engineering, green design, organic chemistry, and post-AP Physics.[11] In 2022, the school prepared to accept an astronomical observatory.[12]\n\n\nFreshmen at Bronx Science are required to take one-semester courses in research literacy and engineering, while sophomores take one-semester courses consisting of coding and rhetoric. Collectively, these are referred to as Foundational courses. Sophomore students may satisfy this requirement by instead taking a class in the research program, a three-year long program that culminates in an independent research project and final research paper that is submitted to Regeneron and other prestigious competitions in senior year. The research program is divided into biology, math, physical science/engineering, and social science research.[11]\n\n\nThe mathematics department offers standard AP courses in AB/BC calculus, statistics, and computer science. Students can take precalculus alongside honors algebra 2 and trigonometry in their sophomore year, allowing them to take AP Calculus in their junior year. Post-AP courses in mathematics include multivariable calculus, linear algebra and differential equations, video game development, app development, game theory, and a newly introduced course in financial and actuarial math.[11]\n\n\nStudents are required to take four years of English. AP English Language and AP English Literature are offered, along with journalism workshop and yearbook design. In junior year, students have the option to take the unique AP American Studies course, an interdisciplinary course that correlates the AP English Language and AP United States History courses, while in senior year, the AP English Literature course is divided into courses in creative writing and traditional literature. Four years of social studies or history classes are required. AP European History and AP World History are both offered in sophomore year in preparation for the Global History Regents, while juniors can take AP United States History to satisfy the U.S. history requirement. Senior social studies classes consist of several combinations of AP classes in U.S. Government and Politics, Comparative Government and Politics, Microeconomics, and Macroeconomics. Additional classes in social studies, which must be taken along with these ones, include AP Human Geography, race and gender, and unique classes in Holocaust leadership and speech and debate leadership. A minimum of 2 years of languages are required, if students had previously taken a year of language prior to high school. Bronx Science offers French, Spanish, Latin, Italian, Chinese, and Japanese. At one time Hebrew, Russian, Korean, and German were also offered. AP German Language and Culture is the only AP class not offered at Bronx Science.[11]\n\n\nStudents must also obtain credits from two terms of a class in the fine arts or the equivalent. The fine arts requirement is usually satisfied during Bronx Science's Summer Program which offers Drama, Music, and Art. Students usually \"double up\" on two of these courses to satisfy the fine arts requirement for once and all during the time period of one summer. Students are expected to satisfy the arts requirement by the end of sophomore year. Students can also take art or music electives during the school year to satisfy the fine arts requirement by taking a music elective such as jazz band or an arts elective such as AP Art History or AP Studio Art during the regular school year. Health and physical education courses are also required, and the Health requirement may also be fulfilled during the Bronx Science Summer Program in addition to the two fine arts courses.[11]\n\n\n\n### Advanced placement courses[edit]\n\n\nBronx Science offers all of the AP courses, except for AP German Language and Culture and the AP Capstone program.

The paper is printed using funds from its advertisers, with no fiscal school support. The paper is distributed on average five times per year at no charge. *The Science Survey* has been the name of the Bronx Science student newspaper since the founding of the school in 1938.\n\n\n**Dynamo** is the literary magazine sponsored by the English Department, consisting of original poems and stories submitted by students from all grades.[16] *The Observatory* is Bronx Science's prize-winning yearbook.[17] The yearbook office has a custom-built web server to manage its production, powered by MediaWiki and Coppermine software.\n\n\nOther department-produced publications include the annual **Math Bulletin**,[18] consisting of student term papers, original student mathematics research, and topics in mathematics; *Exposition*, an annual production of the Social Studies Department; and *Reactions*,[19] written by physical science students.\n\n\n\n## Reputation[edit]\n\n\nBronx Science has received international recognition. In 2020, Newsweek's rankings of the top 5,000 STEM High Schools in the United States (public and private), listed Bronx Science as the 4th best STEM school in the nation.[20]\n\n\nIn 2014, the school ranked 34th out of all high schools nationwide and 1st in New York;[21] nationwide, Bronx Science ranked 33rd in 2008 and 58th in 2009.[22] It attracts an intellectually gifted blend of culturally, ethnically,[23][24] and economically diverse students from New York City.[25] As of 2012[update], Bronx Science is ranked as one of the \"22 top-performing schools\"[26] in America on The Washington Post as well as number 50 out of a list of the best 1,000 high schools in the country on The Daily Beast's \"America's Best High Schools\"[27] list. In 2014 it was ranked second highest on *Cities Journal*'s list of the \"15 Best High Schools in New York\",[28] along with Stuyvesant (ranked third)[29] and Brooklyn Tech (ranked eighth).[30]\n\n\nThe average SAT score in 2012 was 2,010 out of 2,400.[31] Almost all Bronx Science graduates continue on to four-year colleges, and it is a \"feeder school\", with many graduates going on to Ivy League schools and other institutions of higher learning each year.[32] Bronx Science has counted 132 finalists in the Regeneron (formerly Intel) Science Talent Search, the largest number of any high school.[33] Nine graduates have won Nobel Prizes\u2014more than any other secondary education institution in the world[34]\u2014and seven have won Pulitzer Prizes.[35][36] Of the nine Nobel Prizes earned by graduates, seven of them are in physics, which earned Bronx Science a designation by the American Physical Society as a \"Historic Physics Site\" in 2010.[37][38]\n\n\nBronx Science is a member of the National Consortium of Secondary STEM Schools (NCSSS).[39] Together with Stuyvesant High School and Brooklyn Technical High School, it is one of the three original specialized science high schools operated by the New York City Department of Education.[40]\n\n\n\n## Transportation[edit]\n\n\nThe New York City Subway's Bedford Park Boulevard (B and \u200bD trains) and Bedford Park Boulevard\u2013Lehman College (4 train) stations are located nearby.[41] Additionally, New York City Bus's Bx10, Bx22, Bx26 and Bx28 routes stop near Bronx Science.[42]\n\n\n\n## Notable alumni[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Bronx High School of Science alumni\n\nMany people who attended the Bronx High School of Science have achieved distinction in their respective fields, including winning the Nobel and Pulitzer Prizes, the Academy, Emmy and Turing Awards, the U.S. National Medal of Science, political office and numerous professional society honors.\n\n\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\n\nBronx Science was the primary rival of Millard Fillmore High School in *Head of the Class*, a television series that aired from 1986 to 1991.\n\n\nBronx Science formed the basis for the Midtown School of Science and Technology in *Spider-Man: Homecoming*, part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.[43]\n\n\nThe 2019 Spike Lee produced film, *See You Yesterday* takes place primarily at Bronx Science.[44]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** \n\"Search for Public Schools - Bronx High School of Science (360008701922)\". *National Center for Education Statistics*.

Colston, chair of the Math Department at Manual Training High School, recommended establishing a technical high school for Brooklyn boys. His plan envisioned a heavy concentration of math, science, and drafting courses with parallel paths leading either to college or to a technical career in industry. By 1922, Dr. Colston's concept was approved by the Board of Education, and Brooklyn Technical High School opened in a converted warehouse at 49 Flatbush Avenue Extension, with 2,400 students. This location, in the shadow of the Manhattan Bridge, is the reason the school seal bears that bridge's image, rather than the more obvious symbol for the borough, the Brooklyn Bridge. Brooklyn Tech would occupy one more location before settling into its site at 29 Fort Greene Place, for which the groundbreaking was held in 1930.[17]\n\n\n\n### Early years[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Brooklyn Technical High School |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) |\n| Address |\n| ![Map](image) |\n| 29 Fort Greene Place\nBrooklyn\n, New York\n 11217\nUnited States\n |\n| Coordinates | 40\u00b041\u203220\u2033N 73\u00b058\u203237\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff40.68889\u00b0N 73.97694\u00b0W\ufeff / 40.68889; -73.97694 |\n| Information |\n| Type | Selective school |\n| Established | 1922; 102\u00a0years ago\u00a0(1922) |\n| Founder | Albert L.

Routinely, 99% of its graduates are accepted to four-year colleges[13] with the 2020 graduating class being offered more than $150 million in scholarships and grants.[14] In 2011, *U.S. News & World Report* ranked Brooklyn Tech among the nation's 50 best high schools for mathematics and science.[15] It was ranked #2 on *Niche*'s \"Standout High Schools in America\" list.[16]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Admissions | Competitive Examination |\n| Website | bths.edu |\n\n\n**Brooklyn Technical High School**, commonly called **Brooklyn Tech** and administratively designated **High School 430**, is a public high school in New York City that specializes in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. It is one of the three original specialized high schools operated by the New York City Department of Education, along with Stuyvesant High School and the Bronx High School of Science. Brooklyn Tech is considered one of the country's most prestigious and selective high schools.[4][5]\n\n\nAdmission to Brooklyn Tech involves taking the Specialized High Schools Admissions Test and scoring the cutoff for Brooklyn Tech. Each November, about 30,000 eighth and ninth graders take the 3-hour test for admittance to eight of the nine specialized high schools. About 1,400 to 1,500 students are admitted each year.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n## Notable alumni[edit]\n\n\nA list of notable alumni of Brooklyn Technical High School is listed below.

The curriculum consists of two years of general studies with a technical and engineering emphasis, followed by two years of a student-chosen major.\n\n\nThe curriculum remained largely unchanged until the end of Dr. Colston's 20-year term as principal in 1942. Upon his retirement, Tech was led briefly by acting principal Ralph Breiling, who was succeeded by Principal Harold Taylor in 1944. Tech's modernization would come under Principal William Pabst, who assumed stewardship in 1946 after serving as chair of the Electrical Department. Pabst created new majors and refined older ones, allowing students to select science and engineering preparatory majors including Aeronautical, Architecture, Chemical, Civil, Electrical (later including Electronics and Broadcast), Industrial Design, Mechanical, Structural, and Arts and Sciences. A general College Preparatory curriculum was added later.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBrooklyn Tech is one of the most elite, prestigious and selective high schools in the United States.[4][5] Together with Stuyvesant High School and Bronx High School of Science, it is one of the three original Specialized High Schools of New York City, operated by the New York City Department of Education, all three of which *The Washington Post* cited in 2006 as among the country's best magnet schools (a category the school is often placed in, though its founding predates the concept of a \"magnet school\", whose intended purpose was not the same).[9] Admission is by competitive examination. As a public school, BTHS has no tuition fee, but only students who reside in New York City are allowed to attend, as per the Hecht-Calandra Act.[a]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Brooklyn Technical High School.\n\n* Official website\n* The Tech Internet Radio Project\n* Brooklyn Tech Robotics Team 334: The TechKnights\n* Brooklyn Tech Alumni Association\n* InsideSchools.org: H.S. 430 Brooklyn Technical High School\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"BTHS Homepage (numbers found at bottom)\".

These [...] were excluded from the list of top high schools because [...] their sky-high SAT and ACT scores indicate they have few or no average students\".[11] Brooklyn Technical High School consistently appears in the *U.S. News and World Reports* list of the top 50 High Schools in the United States.[12]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBrooklyn Tech counts top scientists, inventors, innovators, *Fortune* 500 company CEOs and founders, high-ranking diplomats, academic scholars, literary and media figures, professional athletes, National Medal recipients, Nobel laureates, and Olympic medalists among its alumni.\n\n\n\n\n## Overview[edit]\n\n\n### Admission[edit]\n\n\nAdmission to Brooklyn Tech is based exclusively on the Specialized High Schools Admissions Test (SHSAT), open to all eighth-grade and first-time ninth-grade New York City students. The test has math (word problems and computation) and verbal (reading comprehension and grammar) sections.

However, these were not afforded Specialized High Schools status under New York State Law.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nStudents are placed into a major during the second semester of their sophomore year after ranking all the majors in order of preference. These majors include courses, typically Advanced Placement or Project Lead the Way (PLTW) courses, that concentrate in that specific area of interest given to students during their last two years at Tech. Each major has a different formula (PI index) used to rank students according to their ranking preference of the majors and their current averages from freshman and sophomore year. A student with a higher PI index for their second preference if they did not get into their first, will get priority over another student with a lower average on the same major preference.[53]\n\n\nBret Stephens, an opinion columnist, wrote in *The New York Times* that \"The success of Brooklyn Tech only casts an unflattering light on every other corner of the public school bureaucracy.\"[54]\n\n\n\n## Extracurricular activities[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSixteen alumni died in the September 11 attacks in 2001. They are Dennis Cross '59, Ronald F. Orsini '60, Joel Miller '63, Sheldon R. Kanter '66, Stephen Johnson '75, Danny Libretti '76, Dominick E. Calia '79, Dipti Patel '81, Andre Fletcher '82, Courtney W. Walcott '82, Gerard Jean Baptiste '83, Wai C. Chung '84, Paul Innella '85, Michael McDonnell '85, Thomas Tong '87, and Paul Ortiz '98.[27]\n\n\nSince 2001, Brooklyn Tech has undergone refurbishing such as the renovation of the school's William L. Mack Library entrance, located on the fifth-floor center section. As well, two computer labs were added. The school also reinstated a class devoted to the study of Shakespeare, which students can elect to take in their senior year.\n\n\n\n#### Lee McCaskill[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Radio studio and 18,000 watt transmitter licensed by the Federal Communications Commission as WNYE (FM).

To further commemorate the anniversary, a monument was erected, with a time capsule beneath it, in the north courtyard. The monument has eight panels, each with a unique design representing each of Tech's eight majors at that point.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn 1983, Matt Mandery's appointment as principal made him the first Tech alumnus to hold that position.[20] The following year, Tech received the Excellence in Education award from the U.S. Department of Education.[*citation needed*] The Alumni Association was formally created during this time,[20] and coalitions were formed with the New York City Department of Transportation.[*citation needed*] Mandery oversaw the addition of a Bio-Medical major to the curriculum. John Tobin followed as principal in 1987, abolished the Materials Science department, and closed the seventh-floor foundry.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nTech has a literary art journal, Horizons, for those who want to express themselves through art, poetry, photography, and prose.[56] The Model United Nations provides students with a venue for discussing foreign affairs and also hosts a conference each year called TechMUN.[57][56] Other clubs cater to a wide range of topics such as anime, the Stock Market, *Dance Dance Revolution*, ultimate Frisbee, politics, quilting, fashion, debate (which offers Public Forum, Congress and Policy), table tennis and animal rights. The cheerleading squad is named the Enginettes. In 2012, Tech students created a Junior State of America Chapter at their school.[56] Brooklyn Tech has its own student union, to address issues on a student level. Tech has a variety of community service clubs, such as Key Club, Red Cross Club, and BETA.[56] Tech students put on a musical each spring.[56]\n\n\nThere are two step teams, Lady Dragons and Organized C.H.A.O.S.[56]\n\n\nThe school has several Coordinator of Student Activities (COSA).[58]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* The 420-foot WNYE-FM tower atop the school is three times taller than the building. The entire structure combined is 597 feet (182 meters) tall.[48] It was the tallest structure in Brooklyn, beating out AVA DoBro by only one foot, but beaten in 2017 with the completion of The Hub, which is 13 feet taller.\n* In 1934, the Public Works of Art Project (PWAP), which later became the Works Projects Administration (WPA), commissioned artist Maxwell B. Starr to paint a mural in the foyer depicting the evolution of man and science throughout history.\n\n\n## Transportation[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
