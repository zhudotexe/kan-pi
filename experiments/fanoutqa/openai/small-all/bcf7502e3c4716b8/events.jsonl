The CIA reports the total as 643,801 km2. Another source, the French Institut national de la statistique et des études économiques (National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies), gives an area figure of 632,759 km2.[13] (The CIA gives a water area of metropolitan France as 1,530 km2.)

However, the figures used by each source *include* coastal and territorial waters for the United States but *exclude* coastal and territorial waters for China. China's coastal and territorial water figures are unknown (no official publication) and thus cannot be added into China's total area figure. But Encyclopædia Britannica specifies the United States' area excluding coastal and territorial waters as 9,525,067 km2,[6] less than the figure given for China's area by any of the three sources. Therefore, while it can be determined that China has a larger area excluding coastal and territorial waters, it is unclear which country has a larger area including coastal and territorial waters.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n13. **^** \"Résultats de la recherche | Insee\".\n14. **^** Global Forest Resources Assessment 2015: Country Report Botswana (PDF) (Report).
