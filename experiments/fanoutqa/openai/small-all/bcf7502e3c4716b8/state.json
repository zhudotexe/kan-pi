China's coastal and territorial water figures are unknown (no official publication) and thus cannot be added into China's total area figure. But Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica specifies the United States' area excluding coastal and territorial waters as 9,525,067 km2,[6] less than the figure given for China's area by any of the three sources. Therefore, while it can be determined that China has a larger area excluding coastal and territorial waters, it is unclear which country has a larger area including coastal and territorial waters.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n13. **^** \"R\u00e9sultats de la recherche | Insee\".\n14. **^** Global Forest Resources Assessment 2015: Country Report Botswana (PDF) (Report).
