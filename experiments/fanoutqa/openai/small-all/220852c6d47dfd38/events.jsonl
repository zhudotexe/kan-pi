It stands over 3,000 metres (9,840 ft) above much of the glacial valley bottoms at its base. It is a consistently steep pyramid, dropping quickly in almost all directions. The north side is the steepest: there it rises over 3,200 metres (10,500 ft) above the K2 (Qogir) Glacier in only 3,000 metres (9,800 ft) of horizontal distance. In most directions, it achieves over 2,800 metres (9,200 ft) of vertical relief in less than 4,000 metres (13,000 ft).[28]\n\n\nA 1986 expedition led by George Wallerstein made an inaccurate measurement showing that K2 was taller than Mount Everest, and therefore the tallest mountain in the world.[29] A corrected measurement was made in 1987, but by then the claim that K2 was the tallest mountain in the world had already made it into many news reports and reference works.[30]\n\n\n\n## Height[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nK2 is ranked 22nd by topographic prominence, a measure of a mountain's independent stature. It is a part of the same extended area of uplift (including the Karakoram, the Tibetan Plateau, and the Himalayas) as Mount Everest, and it is possible to follow a path from K2 to Everest that goes no lower than 4,594 metres (15,072 ft), at the Kora La on the Nepal/China border in the Mustang Lo. Many other peaks far lower than K2 are more independent in this sense. It is, however, the most prominent peak within the Karakoram range.[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"K2\". *Peakbagger.com*.\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \n\"Karakoram and India/Pakistan Himalayas Ultra-Prominences\". peaklist.org.

Its summit lies at 8,586 m (28,169 ft) in a section of the Himalayas, the *Kangchenjunga Himal*, which is bounded in the west by the Tamur River, in the north by the Lhonak River and Jongsang La, and in the east by the Teesta River.[1][3] It lies in the border region between Nepal and Sikkim state of India, with three of the five peaks, namely Main, Central and South, directly on the border,[4] and the peaks West and Kangbachen in Nepal's Taplejung District.[5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nKangchenjunga Main is the highest elevation of the Brahmaputra River basin, which forms part of the southeast Asian monsoon regime and is among the globally largest river basins.[25]\nKangchenjunga is one of six peaks above 8,000 m (26,000 ft) located in the basin of the Kosi River, which is among the largest tributaries of the Ganges.[26]\nThe Kangchenjunga massif forms also part of the Ganges Basin.[27]\n\n\nAlthough it is the third highest peak in the world, Kangchenjunga is only ranked 29th by topographic prominence, a measure of a mountain's independent stature. The key col for Kangchenjunga lies at a height of 4,664 metres (15,302 ft), along the watershed boundary between Arun and Brahmaputra rivers in Tibet.[28] It is, however, the fourth-most-prominent peak in the Himalayas, after Everest, and the western and eastern anchors of the Himalaya, Nanga Parbat and Namcha Barwa, respectively.[29]\n\n\n\n## Climbing routes[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Recent Heroes of Modern Adventure, T.

After allowing for further verification of all calculations, it was officially announced in 1856 that Kangchenjunga was the third-highest mountain.[6]\n\n\nThe Kangchenjunga is a sacred mountain in Nepal and Sikkim and was first climbed on 25 May 1955 by Joe Brown and George Band, who were part of the 1955 British Kangchenjunga expedition. They stopped just short of the true summit, keeping a promise given to Tashi Namgyal, the Chogyal of Sikkim, that the top of the mountain would remain inviolate.[7] The Indian side of the mountain is off-limits to climbers. In 2016, the adjoining Khangchendzonga National Park was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n60. **^** Anna Belikci Denjongpa, *Kangchendzönga: Secular and Buddhist perceptions of the mountain deity of Sikkim among the Lhopos*\n61. **^** \"The Abominable Snowman: Bear, Cat or Creature?\". myfoxdfw.com. 2010.

Franco, Guido Magnone and Gyalzen Norbu Sherpa summitted the next day, followed by Jean Bouvier, Serge Coupé, Pierre Leroux and André Vialatte on the 17th. This was an amazing achievement at the time, to have the vast majority of expedition members summit, especially on such a difficult peak. Prior to this time, summits were reached by one to two expedition members at most, with the rest of teams providing logistical support before turning around and heading home. The French team climbed Makalu by the north face and northeast ridge, via the saddle between Makalu and Kangchungtse (the Makalu-La), establishing the standard route.[4]\n\n\nAn ascent without oxygen was attempted by the 1960-61 Silver Hut expedition but two attempts did not succeed.\n\n\n\n### Notable ascents[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe first climb on Makalu was made by an American team led by Riley Keegan in the spring of 1954. The expedition was composed of Sierra Club members including Bill Long and Allen Steck, and was called the California Himalayan Expedition to Makalu.[3]\nThey attempted the southeast ridge but were turned back at 7,100 metres (23,300 ft) by a constant barrage of storms. A New Zealand team including Sir Edmund Hillary was also active in the spring, but did not get very high due to injury and illness. In the fall of 1954, a French reconnaissance expedition made the first ascents of the subsidiary summits Kangchungtse (October 22: Jean Franco, Lionel Terray, sirdar Gyalzen Norbu Sherpa and Pa Norbu) and Chomo Lonzo (October 30?: Jean Couzy and Terray).[4]\n\n\n\n### First ascent[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 1955 French Makalu expedition\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHara, Makoto; Asami, Masao (1971). \"Makalu's South Ridge\". *American Alpine Journal*.

The Chinese team measured a snow-ice depth of 3.5 m (11 ft),[33] which is in agreement with a net elevation of 8,848 m (29,029 ft). An argument arose between China and Nepal as to whether the official height should be the rock height (8,844 m, China) or the snow height (8,848 m, Nepal). In 2010, both sides agreed that the height of Everest is 8,848 m, and Nepal recognises China's claim that the rock height of Everest is 8,844 m.[41] On 8 December 2020, it was jointly announced by the two countries that the new official height is 8,848.86 metres (29,031.7 ft).[42][43]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** *Geography of Nepal: Physical, Economic, Cultural and Regional* by Netra Bahadur Thapa, D.P.

A rock head elevation of 8,850 m (29,035 ft), and a snow/ice elevation 1 m (3 ft) higher, were obtained via this device.[36] Although as of 2001, it has not been officially recognised by Nepal,[37] this figure is widely quoted. Geoid uncertainty casts doubt upon the accuracy claimed by both the 1999 and 2005 (see § 21st-century surveys) surveys.[38]\n\n\nIn 1955, a detailed photogrammetric map (at a scale of 1:50,000) of the Khumbu region, including the south side of Mount Everest, was made by Erwin Schneider as part of the 1955 International Himalayan Expedition, which also attempted Lhotse.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBy the same measure of base to summit, Denali, in Alaska, formerly known as Mount McKinley, is taller than Everest as well.[note 5] Despite its height above sea level of only 6,190 m (20,308 ft), Denali sits atop a sloping plain with elevations from 300 to 900 m (980 to 2,950 ft), yielding a height above base in the range of 5,300 to 5,900 m (17,400 to 19,400 ft); a commonly quoted figure is 5,600 m (18,400 ft).[47][48] By comparison, reasonable base elevations for Everest range from 4,200 m (13,800 ft) on the south side to 5,200 m (17,100 ft) on the Tibetan Plateau, yielding a height above base in the range of 3,650 to 4,650 m (11,980 to 15,260 ft).[39]\n\n\nThe summit of Chimborazo in Ecuador is 2,168 m (7,113 ft) farther from Earth's centre (6,384.4 km, 3,967.1 mi) than that of Everest (6,382.3 km, 3,965.8 mi), because the Earth bulges at the equator.[49] This is despite Chimborazo having a peak 6,268 m (20,564.3 ft) above sea level versus Mount Everest's 8,848 m (29,028.9 ft).\n\n\n\n## Geology[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n34. **^** \"Nepal and China agree on Mount Everest's height\". *BBC News*. 8 April 2010.

The altitude can expose the summit to the fast and freezing winds of the jet stream.[84] Winds commonly attain 160 km/h (100 mph);[85] in February 2004, a wind speed of 280 km/h (175 mph) was recorded at the summit.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBy March 2012, Everest had been climbed 5,656 times with 223 deaths.[91] Although lower mountains have longer or steeper climbs, Everest is so high the jet stream can hit it. Climbers can be faced with winds beyond 320 km/h (200 mph) when the weather shifts.[92] At certain times of the year the jet stream shifts north, providing periods of relative calm at the mountain.[93] Other dangers include blizzards and avalanches.[93]\n\n\nBy 2013, The Himalayan Database recorded 6,871 summits by 4,042 different people.[94]\n\n\n\n### Early attempts[edit]\n\n\nIn 1885, Clinton Thomas Dent, president of the Alpine Club, suggested that climbing Mount Everest was possible in his book *Above the Snow Line*.[95]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n**This article contains Tibetan script.** Without proper rendering support, you may see very small fonts, misplaced vowels or missing conjuncts instead of Tibetan characters.\n\n![](image)North Face as seen from the path to North Base Camp\n![](image)Everest and Lhotse from the south.

Waugh began work on Nicolson's data in 1854, and along with his staff spent almost two years working on the numbers, having to deal with the problems of light refraction, barometric pressure, and temperature over the vast distances of the observations. Finally, in March 1856 he announced his findings in a letter to his deputy in Calcutta.
