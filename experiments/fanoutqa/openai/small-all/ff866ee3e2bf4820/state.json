It officially became a university in 1896 and was subsequently renamed Princeton University.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe university is governed by the Trustees of Princeton University and has an endowment of $37.7 billion, the largest endowment per student in the United States. Princeton provides undergraduate and graduate instruction in the humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, and engineering to approximately 8,500 students on its 600 acres (2.4\u00a0km2) main campus. It offers postgraduate degrees through the Princeton School of Public and International Affairs, the School of Engineering and Applied Science, the School of Architecture and the Bendheim Center for Finance. The university also manages the Department of Energy's Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory and is home to the NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory.

The university's central campus sits on a 15-acre (6.1-hectare) block bounded by Waterman, Prospect, George, and Thayer Streets; newer buildings extend northward, eastward, and southward. Brown's core, historic campus, constructed primary between 1770 and 1926, is defined by three greens: the Front or Quiet Green, the Middle or College Green, and the Ruth J. Simmons Quadrangle (historically known as Lincoln Field).[57][58] A brick and wrought-iron fence punctuated by decorative gates and arches traces the block's perimeter. This section of campus is primarily Georgian and Richardsonian Romanesque in its architectural character.[57]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBrown is the largest institutional landowner in Providence, with properties on College Hill and in the Jewelry District.[55] The university was built contemporaneously with the eighteenth and nineteenth-century precincts surrounding it, making Brown's campus tightly integrated into Providence's urban fabric. Among the noted architects who have shaped Brown's campus are McKim, Mead & White, Philip Johnson, Rafael Vi\u00f1oly, Diller Scofidio + Renfro, and Robert A. M. Stern.[56]\n\n\n\n### Main campus[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe university comprises the College, the Graduate School, Alpert Medical School, the School of Engineering, the School of Public Health and the School of Professional Studies. Its international programs are organized through the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs, and it is academically affiliated with the Marine Biological Laboratory and the Rhode Island School of Design; with the latter, it offers undergraduate and graduate dual degree programs.\n\n\nBrown's main campus is in the College Hill neighborhood of Providence, Rhode Island. The university is surrounded by a federally listed architectural district with a dense concentration of Colonial-era buildings. Benefit Street, which runs along the campus's western edge, has one of America's richest concentrations of 17th- and 18th-century architecture.[14][15] Brown's undergraduate admissions are among the most selective in the country, with an overall acceptance rate of 5% for the class of 2026.[16][17]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nEast Campus, centered on Hope and Charlesfield streets, originally served as the campus of Bryant University. In 1969, as Bryant was preparing to relocate to Smithfield, Rhode Island, Brown purchased their Providence campus for $5 million. The transaction expanded the Brown campus by 10 acres (40,000\u00a0m2) and 26 buildings. In 1971, Brown renamed the area East Campus.[74] Today, the area is largely used for dormitories.\n\n\nThayer Street runs through Brown's main campus. As a commercial corridor frequented by students, Thayer is comparable to Harvard Square or Berkeley's Telegraph Avenue. Wickenden Street, in the adjacent Fox Point neighborhood, is another commercial street similarly popular among students.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBrown's School of Public Health occupies a landmark modernist building along the Providence River. Other Brown properties include the 376-acre (1.52\u00a0km2) Mount Hope Grant in Bristol, Rhode Island, an important Native American site noted as a location of King Philip's War. Brown's Haffenreffer Museum of Anthropology Collection Research Center, particularly strong in Native American items, is located in the Mount Hope Grant.\n\n\n\n### Sustainability[edit]\n\n\nBrown has committed to \"minimize its energy use, reduce negative environmental impacts, and promote environmental stewardship.\"[78] Since 2010, the university has required all new buildings meet LEED silver standards.[79] Between 2007 and 2018, Brown reduced its greenhouse emissions by 27 percent; the majority of this reduction is attributable to the university's Thermal Efficiency Project which converted its central heating plant from a steam-powered system to a hot water-powered system.[80]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBrown University| File:Langfr-150px-Universit\u00e9 Brown (logo).pngCoat of arms\n |\n| Latin: *Universitas Brunensis* |\n| Former names\n | Rhode Island College (1764\u20131804) |\n| Motto | *In Deo Speramus* (Latin) |\n| Motto in\u00a0English\n | \"In God We Hope\"[1] |\n| Type | Private research university |\n| Established | September\u00a015, 1764; 259 years ago\u00a0(1764-09-15) |\n| Accreditation | NECHE |\n| Academic affiliations\n | * AAU\n* COFHE\n* URA\n* NAICU\n* Space-grant\n |\n| Endowment | $6.6 billion (2023)[2] |\n| President | Christina Paxson |\n| Provost | Francis J.

[83]\n\n\nAccording to the A. W. Kuchler U.S. potential natural vegetation types, Brown would have a dominant vegetation type of Appalachian Oak (*104*) with a dominant vegetation form of Eastern Hardwood Forest (*25*).[84]\n\n\n\n## Academics[edit]\n\n\n### The College[edit]\n\n\nMain article: College of Brown University\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBuilt in 1925, Brown Stadium\u2014the home of the school's football team\u2014is located approximately a mile and a half northeast of the university's central campus.[75] Marston Boathouse, the home of Brown's crew teams, lies on the Seekonk River, to the southeast of campus. Brown's sailing teams are based out of the Ted Turner Sailing Pavilion at the Edgewood Yacht Club in adjacent Cranston.\n\n\nSince 2011, Brown's Warren Alpert Medical School has been located in Providence's historic Jewelry District, near the medical campus of Brown's teaching hospitals, Rhode Island Hospital and the Women and Infants Hospital of Rhode Island. Other university facilities, including molecular medicine labs and administrative offices, are likewise located in the area.[76][77]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Brown University Admission Facts and Figures\".

To establish a campus, John and Moses Brown purchased a four-acre lot on the crest of College Hill on behalf of the school. The majority of the property fell within the bounds of the original home lot of Chad Brown, an ancestor of the Browns and one of the original proprietors of Providence Plantations.[34] After the college was relocated to the city, work began on constructing its first building.\n\n\nA building committee, organized by the corporation, developed plans for the college's first purpose-built edifice, finalizing a design on February 9, 1770. The subsequent structure, referred to as \"The College Edifice\" and later as University Hall, may have been modeled on Nassau Hall, built 14 years prior at the College of New Jersey. President Manning, an active member of the building process, was educated at Princeton and might have suggested that Brown's first building resemble that of his alma mater.[35]\n\n\n\n#### Brown family[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Colors | Seal brown,\u00a0cardinal red,\u00a0and\u00a0white[5]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 |\n| Nickname | Bears |\n| Sporting affiliations\n | * NCAA Division I FCS \u2013 Ivy League\n* ECAC Hockey\n* EARC\n* EAWRC\n* NEISA\n* CWPA\n* IRA\n |\n| Mascot | Bruno the Bear |\n| Website | www.brown.edu |\n| ![](image) |\n\n\n**Brown University** is a private Ivy League research university in Providence, Rhode Island.

About 7,200 undergraduate students are enrolled in the college [*when?*], and 81 concentrations are offered. For the graduating class of 2020, the most popular concentrations were Computer Science, Economics, Biology, History, Applied Mathematics, International Relations, and Political Science. A quarter of Brown undergraduates complete more than one concentration before graduating.[85] If the existing programs do not align with their intended curricular interests, undergraduates may design and pursue independent concentrations.[86]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1827, medical instruction was suspended by President Francis Wayland after the program's faculty declined to follow a new policy requiring students to live on campus. The program was reorganized in 1972; the first M.D. degrees from the new Program in Medicine were awarded to a graduating class of 58 students in 1975. In 1991, the school was officially renamed the Brown University School of Medicine, then renamed once more to Brown Medical School in October 2000.[134] In January 2007, entrepreneur and philanthropist Warren Alpert donated $100 million to the school. In recognition of the gift, the school's name was changed to the Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University.\n\n\nIn 2020, *U.S. News & World Report* ranked Brown's medical school the 9th most selective in the country, with an acceptance rate of 2.8%.[135] *U.S. News* ranks the school 38th for research and 35th for primary care.[136]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBrown's medical school is known especially for its eight-year Program in Liberal Medical Education (PLME), an eight-year combined baccalaureate-M.D. medical program. Inaugurated in 1984, the program is one of the most selective and renowned programs of its type in the country, offering admission to only 2% of applicants in 2021.[137]\n\n\nSince 1976, the Early Identification Program (EIP) has encouraged Rhode Island residents to pursue careers in medicine by recruiting sophomores from Providence College, Rhode Island College, the University of Rhode Island, and Tougaloo College. In 2004, the school once again began to accept applications from premedical students at other colleges and universities via AMCAS like most other medical schools. The medical school also offers M.D./PhD, M.D./M.P.H. and M.D./M.P.P. dual degree programs.\n\n\n\n### School of Public Health[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Brown University School of Public Health\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n77. **^** Bai, Corrine (January 30, 2019). \"South Street Landing move improves staff experience\". *Brown Daily Herald*.

Upon its 1971 merger with the College of Brown University, Pembroke's campus was absorbed into the larger Brown campus. The Pembroke campus is bordered by Meeting, Brown, Bowen, and Thayer Streets and sits three blocks north of Brown's central campus. The campus is dominated by brick architecture, largely of the Georgian and Victorian styles. The west side of the quadrangle comprises Pembroke Hall (1897), Smith-Buonanno Hall (1907), and Metcalf Hall (1919), while the east side comprises Alumnae Hall (1927) and Miller Hall (1910).

Freedman and a controversial (and ultimately unsuccessful) 1999 initiative to encourage the school's single-sex Greek houses to go coed.[30][40] The first decade of the 21st century saw the commencement of the $1.5 billion Campaign for the Dartmouth Experience, the largest capital fundraising campaign in the college's history, which surpassed $1 billion in 2008.[41][42] The mid- and late first decade of the 21st century have also seen extensive campus construction, with the erection of two new housing complexes, full renovation of two dormitories, and a forthcoming dining hall, life sciences center, and visual arts center.[43] In 2004, Booz Allen Hamilton selected Dartmouth College as a model of institutional endurance \"whose record of endurance has had implications and benefits for all American organizations, both academic and commercial\", citing *Dartmouth College v. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n106. **^** Clinton, William J.

Established in 1769 by Eleazar Wheelock, it is one of the nine colonial colleges chartered before the American Revolution. Although originally established to educate Native Americans in Christian theology and the English way of life, the university primarily trained Congregationalist ministers during its early history before it gradually secularized. Emerging into national prominence at the turn of the 20th century, Dartmouth was considered to be the most prestigious undergraduate college in the United States in the early 1900s.[8][9] While Dartmouth is now a research university rather than simply an undergraduate college, it continues to go by \"Dartmouth College\" to emphasize its focus on undergraduate education.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFollowing a liberal arts curriculum, Dartmouth provides undergraduate instruction in 40 academic departments and interdisciplinary programs, including 60 majors in the humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, and engineering, and enables students to design specialized concentrations or engage in dual degree programs.[10] In addition to the undergraduate faculty of arts and sciences, Dartmouth has four professional and graduate schools: the Geisel School of Medicine, the Thayer School of Engineering, the Tuck School of Business, and the Guarini School of Graduate and Advanced Studies.[11] The university also has affiliations with the Dartmouth\u2013Hitchcock Medical Center. Dartmouth is home to the Rockefeller Center for Public Policy and the Social Sciences, the Hood Museum of Art, the John Sloan Dickey Center for International Understanding, and the Hopkins Center for the Arts. With a student enrollment of about 6,700, Dartmouth is the smallest university in the Ivy League. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n140. **^** Santos, Nicholas J (September 17, 2004). \"No Bridge Left Unburned: Rage at Dartmouth\". *The Dartmouth Free Press*.

This tradition is the oldest in the United States, and subsequently went on to catch on at other New England colleges.[205][206] In the spring, Green Key is a weekend mostly devoted to campus parties and celebration.[207]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n220. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Is \"The Big Green\" really Dartmouth's mascot?

The university also administers three satellite campuses, including two in New York City and one in the Education City region of Qatar.[9]\n\n\nCornell is one of the few private land grant universities in the United States.[a] Of its seven undergraduate colleges, three are state-supported statutory or contract colleges through the State University of New York system, including its agricultural and human ecology colleges and its industrial labor relations school. Among Cornell's graduate schools, only the veterinary college is state-supported.

The campus has expanded to approximately 745 acres (301\u00a0ha) since its founding, comprising academic buildings, laboratories, administrative facilities, athletic centers, auditoriums, museums, and residential areas.[36][37] In 2011, *Travel+Leisure* recognized the Ithaca Campus as one of the most beautiful in the United States, praising its unique blend of architectural styles, historic landmarks, and picturesque surroundings.[38]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nCornell University| ![](image) |\n| Latin: *Universitas Cornelliana* |\n| Type | Private[1] land-grant research university |\n| Established | April\u00a027, 1865; 159 years ago\u00a0(1865-04-27) |\n| Founder | * Ezra Cornell\n* Andrew Dickson White\n |\n| Accreditation | MSCHE |\n| Academic affiliations\n | * AAU\n* COFHE\n* NAICU\n* SUNY\n* URA\n* Sea-grant\n* Space-grant\n |\n| Endowment | $10.0\u00a0billion (2023)[2] |\n| Budget | $5.4\u00a0billion (2023)[3] |\n| President | Martha E.

The campus is bordered by two gorges, Fall Creek Gorge and Cascadilla Gorge, which contribute to the university's natural landscape. Although these gorges are popular swimming spots during warmer months, their use is discouraged by the university and city code due to potential safety hazards.[49] Adjacent to the main campus, Cornell owns the 2,800-acre (1,100 ha) Cornell Botanic Gardens, featuring various plants, trees, and ponds. The gardens' trails allow visitors to explore the natural surroundings.[50]\n\n\n\n#### Sustainability[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMain articles: Cornell Central Campus, Cornell North Campus, and Cornell West Campus\n\nCentral Campus is the heart of the university, housing the majority of academic and administrative facilities. The architectural styles on Central Campus range from ornate Collegiate Gothic, Victorian, and Neoclassical buildings to more spare international, and modernist structures. Frederick Law Olmsted, the designer of Central Park, proposed a \"grand terrace\" overlooking Cayuga Lake in one of the earliest plans for the campus.[43]\n\n\nNorth Campus features primarily residential buildings, with ten residence halls designed to accommodate first and second-year students, as well as transfer students in the Townhouse Community.,[44] The architectural styles of North Campus are more modern, reflecting the growth of the university and the need for additional housing during the mid-20th century.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPrivate university in Ithaca, New York, U.S.\n\n\"Cornell\" redirects here.

The university was founded in 1865 by Ezra Cornell and Andrew Dickson White. Since its founding, Cornell has been a co-educational, non-sectarian institution where admission has not been restricted by religion or race. The student body for the fall 2022 semester consisted of more than 15,000\u00a0undergraduate and 7,000\u00a0graduate students from all 50\u00a0American states and 130\u00a0countries.[4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCornell's off-campus research facilities include Shoals Marine Laboratory, a seasonal marine field station on Appledore Island off the Maine\u2013New Hampshire coast, is operated in conjunction with the University of New Hampshire and focuses on undergraduate education and research.[74] Until 2011, Cornell operated the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico, which was the site of the world's largest single-dish radio telescope.[75]\n\n\nThe university also maintains several facilities dedicated to conservation and ecology, such as the New York State Agricultural Experiment Station in Geneva, New York. This station operates three substations, including the Cornell Lake Erie Research and Extension Laboratory in Portland,[76] the Hudson Valley Laboratory in Highland,[77] and the Long Island Horticultural Research Laboratory in Riverhead.[78] The Cornell Lab of Ornithology in Ithaca conducts research on biological diversity, primarily in birds,[79]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)A World War I memorial on Cornell's West Campus in Ithaca\n![](image)Cornell's Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art designed by I. M. Pei\n![](image)The A.D. White Reading Room contains much of the 30,000 volume collection donated to the university by its co-founder and first president.\nCornell University owns and operates a variety of off-campus research facilities and offers study abroad and scholarship programs.[73] These facilities and programs contribute to the university's research endeavors and provide students with unique learning opportunities.\n\n\n\n#### Research facilities[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCornell's nine privately endowed, non-statutory colleges include the College of Arts and Sciences, College of Engineering, College of Architecture, Art, and Planning, and College of Hotel Administration. These colleges operate independently of state funding and oversight, giving them greater autonomy in determining their academic programs, admissions, and advising. They also do not offer discounted tuition for New York residents.\n\n\nOf the 15,182 undergraduate students at Cornell, 4,602 (30.3%) are affiliated with the largest college by enrollment, Arts and Sciences, followed by 3,203 (21.1%) in Engineering and 3,101 (20.4%) in Agriculture and Life Sciences. The smallest of the seven undergraduate colleges is Architecture, Art, and Planning, with 503 (3.3%) students.[4] The only university-wide requirements for a baccalaureate degree are to pass a swimming test, take two physical education courses, and satisfy a writing requirement. \n\n\n\n### Fundraising and financial support[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Cornell University Mission\".

In spring of 2022 (Class of 2026), Cornell's undergraduate programs received 71,164 applications and admitted only 5,168 for a 7.2% acceptance rate.[116] For Fall 2019 enrolling freshmen, the middle 50% range of SAT scores were 680\u2013760 for evidence-based reading and writing and 720\u2013800 for mathematics.[117] The middle 50% range of the ACT composite score was 32\u201335.[117]\n\n\nThe university continues to attract a diverse and inclusive student body. The proportion of admitted students who self-identify as underrepresented minorities increased to 34.2% from 33.7% in 2021, and 59.3% self-identify as students of color. That number has increased steadily over the past five years, enrollment officials said, from 52.5% in 2017 and 57.2% in 2020.\n\n\nOf those admitted, 1,163 will be first-generation college students, another increase over 2020's 844.[118] The university is need-blind for domestic applicants.[119]\n\n\n\n### Financial aid[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCornell University is a non-profit organization with a decentralized structure where colleges and schools exercise wide autonomy in defining academic programs, admissions, advising, and conferring degrees. The university comprises nine privately endowed colleges and four publicly supported statutory colleges, offering undergraduate, graduate, and professional programs.

The more ornate buildings generally predate World War II, while the student population doubled from 7,000 in 1950 to 15,000 by 1970, leading to modernist architectural styles becoming more prevalent.[39]\n\n\nSeveral university buildings are listed as historic landmarks,[40] highlighting the architectural and historical significance of the campus. Those listed on the National Register of Historic Places include the Andrew Dickson White House, Bailey Hall, Caldwell Hall, the Computing and Communications Center, Morrill Hall, Rice Hall, Fernow Hall, Wing Hall, Llenroc, and 13 South Avenue (Deke House).[41] Three other listed historic buildings\u2014the original Roberts Hall, East Robert Hall, and Stone Hall\u2014were demolished in the 1980s to make way for new development.[42]\n\n\n\n#### Central, North, and West campuses[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Cornell University Library is the 11th largest academic library in the United States, ranked by number of volumes held.[162] Organized into 20 divisions, in 2005 it held 7.5\u00a0million printed volumes in open stacks, 8.2\u00a0million microfilms and microfiches, and a total of 440,000 maps, motion pictures, DVDs, sound recordings, and computer files in its collections, in addition to extensive digital resources and the University Archives.[163] It was the first among all U.S. colleges and universities to allow undergraduates to borrow books from its libraries.[13] In 2006, *The Princeton Review* ranked it as the 11th best college library,[164] and it climbed to 6th best in 2009.[165] The library plays an active role in furthering online archiving of scientific and historical documents. arXiv, an e-print archive created at Los Alamos National Laboratory by Paul Ginsparg, is operated and primarily funded by Cornell as part of the library's services. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCornell has a rich history of scientific, technological, and engineering research accomplishments. The university has made significant contributions to the fields of nuclear physics, high-energy physics, space exploration, automotive safety, and computing technology, among others. Cornell consistently ranks among the top U.S. universities for patent acquisition and start-up company formation.[176] In the 2004\u201305 academic year, the university filed 203 U.S. patent applications, completed 77 commercial license agreements, and distributed royalties of more than $4.1 million to Cornell units and inventors.[13] In 2009 Cornell spent $671\u00a0million on science and engineering research and development, the 16th highest in the United States.[177]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe university is also host to various student pranks. For example, on at least two different occasions the university has awoken to find something odd atop the 173-foot (52.7\u00a0m) tall McGraw clock tower\u2014once a 60-pound (27\u00a0kg) pumpkin and another time a disco ball. Because there is no access to the spire atop the tower, how the items were put in place remains a mystery.[245] The colors of the lights on McGraw tower change to orange for Halloween and green for St. Patrick's Day.[246] The clock tower also plays music.\n\n\nThe school colors are carnelian (a shade of red) and white, a play on \"Cornellian\" and Andrew Dickson White. A bear is commonly used as the unofficial mascot, which dates back to the introduction of the mascot \"Touchdown\" in 1915, a live bear who was brought onto the field during football games.[8] The university's alma mater is \"Far Above Cayuga's Waters\", and its fight song is \"Give My Regards to Davy\". People associated with the university are called \"Cornellians\".\n\n\n\n### Health[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n224. **^** \"What is the North Campus Residential Expansion?\". *North Campus Residential Expansion AN INITIATIVE OF STUDENT & CAMPUS LIFE*.

Of these, Schuyler House, which was formerly a part of Sage Infirmary,[225] has a dorm layout. Maplewood Apartments, Hasbrouck Apartments, and Thurston Court Apartments are apartment-style, some even allowing for family living. Off campus, many single-family houses in the East Hill neighborhoods adjacent to the university have been converted to apartments. Private developers have also built several multi-story apartment complexes in the Collegetown neighborhood. Nine percent of undergraduate students reside in fraternity and sorority houses, although first semester freshmen are not permitted to join them.[226] Cornell's Greek system has 67 chapters and over 54 Greek residences that house approximately 1,500 students. \n</fragment>\n</document>",
