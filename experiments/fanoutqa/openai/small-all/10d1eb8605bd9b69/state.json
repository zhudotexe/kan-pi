Particle physics (14%), atomic physics (10.9%), and 3 non-physics disciplines are dominating the prize in recent decades. And then semiconductor physics and magnetics are the next most honoured physics disciplines.[18]\n\n\n\n## Laureates[edit]\n\n\n* 1901\n* 1910\n* 1920\n* 1930\n* 1940\n* 1950\n* 1960\n* 1970\n* 1980\n* 1990\n* 2000\n* 2010\n* 2020\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Physics has been awarded to 224 individuals as of 2023.[5] The first prize in physics was awarded in 1901 to Wilhelm Conrad R\u00f6ntgen, of Germany, who received 150,782 SEK. John Bardeen is the only laureate to win the prize twice\u2014in 1956 and 1972.\n\n\nWilliam Lawrence Bragg was the youngest Nobel laureate in physics; he won the prize in 1915 at the age of 25. He was also the youngest laureate for any Nobel prize until 2014 (when Malala Yousafzai won the Nobel Peace Prize at age 17).[6] The oldest Nobel Prize laureate in physics was Arthur Ashkin who was 96 years old when he was awarded the prize in 2018.[7]\n\n\nOnly five women have won the prize: Marie Curie (1903), Maria Goeppert-Mayer (1963), Donna Strickland (2018), Andrea Ghez (2020), and Anne L'Huillier (2023).[8] Before L'Huillier, each woman only ever received a quarter share of the prize, although Marie Curie did receive an unshared Nobel prize in chemistry in 1911. In 2023 L'Huillier received a one-third share.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n27. **^** \"The Nobel Prize in Physics 1909\". Nobel Foundation. Archived from the original on 22 August 2008.
