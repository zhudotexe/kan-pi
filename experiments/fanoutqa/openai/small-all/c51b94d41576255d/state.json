The United States-based scientific agency considers all landmasses surrounded by ocean water, including continental mainlands, as islands. Under their definition, Africa, Australia, Eurasia, North America, and South America are classified as continental mainland islands.[1]\n2. **^** Physiographically, there are only four continents (including offshore continental islands which sit on the nearby continental shelves) that are completely surrounded by water: Afro-Eurasia (57% of the global land area), the Americas (28.5%), Antarctica (9%), and Australia (5%). The remaining 0.5% is made up of remote oceanic islands, mostly scattered within Oceania in the central and south Pacific Ocean.[2]\n3. **^** Including landmasses which are above water and over 2,500,000\u00a0km2 (970,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). The submerged continent of Zealandia (approx. 5,000,000\u00a0km2 (1,900,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi)) is excluded.[3]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 100 | Kerguelen (main island) | 6,617 | 2,555 | French Southern and Antarctic Lands, an overseas territory of France\n |\n| 101 | Siple Island | 6,390 | 2,470 | None (unclaimed island of Antarctica)\n |\n| 102 | Graham Island | 6,361[15] | 2,456 | Canada (British Columbia)\n |\n| 103 | New Siberia (Novaya Sibir) | 6,201 | 2,394 | Russia (Sakha Republic)\n |\n| 104 | Melville Island | 5,765 | 2,226 | Australia (Northern Territory)\n |\n| 105 | Prince Edward Island | 5,620[15] | 2,170 | Canada (Prince Edward Island)\n |\n| 106 | Vanua Levu | 5,587 | 2,157 | Fiji (Northern Division)\n |\n| 107 | Wellington Island | 5,556 | 2,145 | Chile (Magallanes and Ant\u00e1rtica Chilena Region)\n |\n| 108 | Coats Island | 5,498[15] | 2,123 | Canada (Nunavut)\n |\n| 109 | Bali | 5,416 | 2,091 | Indonesia (Bali)\n |\n| 110 | Chichagof Island | 5,388 | 2,080 | United States (Alaska)\n |\n| 111 | Guadalcanal | 5,353 | 2,067 | Solomon Islands (Guadalcanal Province and Capital Territory)\n |\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

This compares to 88.85 per cent and 14.12 per cent Indigenous and non-Indigenous people for Nunavut as a whole. This lower percentage of Indigenous peoples on Baffin Island results from Iqaluit being 59.29 per cent Indigenous and 40.65 per cent non-Indigenous. Of the total population 72.17 per cent are Inuit, 0.92 per cent are First Nations, and 0.73 per cent are M\u00e9tis.

Bjarni appears to be the first European to see Baffin Island, and the first European to see North America beyond Greenland.[31] It was about 15 years later that the Norse Greenlanders, led by Leif Erikson, a son of Erik the Red, started exploring new areas around the year 1000.[31] Baffin Island is thought to be Helluland, and the archaeological site at Tanfield Valley is thought to have been a trading post.[33][34] The Saga of Erik the Red, 1880 translation into English by J. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Inuktitut name for the island is *Qikiqtaaluk*,[6] which means \"very big island\" (*qikiqtaq* \"island\" + *-aluk* \"very big\") and in Inuktitut syllabics is written as \u157f\u146d\u1585\u1456\u14d7\u1483. This name is used for the administrative region the island is part of (Qikiqtaaluk Region), as well as in multiple places in Nunavut and the Northwest Territories,[7] such as some smaller islands: Qikiqtaaluk in Baffin Bay and Qikiqtaaluk in Foxe Basin. Norse explorers referred to it as *Helluland* (\"stone land\").[8] In 1576, English seaman Martin Frobisher made landfall on the island, naming it \"Queen Elizabeth's Foreland\" and Frobisher Bay is named after him.[9] The island is named after English explorer William Baffin, who, in 1616,[10] came across the island while trying to discover the Northwest Passage.[11] It was also formerly known as **James Island**.[12]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Kingnait\n* Perfection\n* Pioneer\n* Piper\n* Polar Bear\n* Revoir\n* Singeyer\n* Strand Fiord\n* Sverdrup\n* Van Hauen\n* Yelverton\n |\n| Glaciers | * Ad Astra Ice Cap\n* Agassiz Ice Cap\n* Barnes Ice Cap\n* Benedict\n* Coronation\n* Devon Ice Cap\n* Disraeli\n* Eugenie\n* Gull\n* Jimi Maasi\n* Kaparoqtalik\n* Keyhole\n* Kiitarayuk\n* Macculloch\n* Narsarsuk\n* Nuuksuq\n* Oliver\n* Parrish\n* Penny Ice Cap\n* Sermilik\n* Sven Hedin\n* Turnabout\n* Utinatuk\n* West Pioneer\n |\n| Regions | * Amund Ringnes\n* Axel Heiberg\n* Baffin\n* Bathurst\n* Bylot\n* Coburg\n* Cornwall\n* Devon\n* Ellef Ringnes\n* Ellesmere\n* Helena\n* \u00cele Vanier\n* Labrador\n* Lougheed\n* Quebec\n |\n| Communities | * Alert\n* Clyde River\n* Eureka\n* Grise Fiord\n* Iqaluit\n* Pangnirtung\n* Pond Inlet\n* Qikiqtarjuaq\n* List of communities in Nunavut\n |\n| Parks | * Auyuittuq\n* Quttinirpaaq\n* Sirmilik\n* Torngat Mountains\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Sabo, George. *Long Term Adaptations Among Arctic Hunter-Gatherers A Case Study from Southern Baffin Island*.

Mount Thor, with an elevation of 1,675\u00a0m (5,495\u00a0ft), is said to have the greatest purely vertical drop (a sheer cliff face) of any mountain on Earth, at 1,250\u00a0m (4,100\u00a0ft).[24] Mount Sharat,[25] with an elevation of 422\u00a0m (1,385\u00a0ft) and a prominence of 67\u00a0m (220\u00a0ft) is located on Baffin Island. The mountain is named after geologist Sharat Kumar Roy, the chief geology curator in the Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago.

This brings very long, cold winters and foggy, cloudy summers, which have helped to add to the remoteness of the island. Spring thaw arrives much later than normal for a position straddling the Arctic Circle: around early June at Iqaluit in the south-east but around early- to mid-July on the north coast where glaciers run right down to sea level. Snow, even heavy snow, can occur at any time of the year, although it is least likely in July and early August. Average annual temperatures at Iqaluit are around \u22129.5\u00a0\u00b0C (14.9\u00a0\u00b0F), compared with around 5\u00a0\u00b0C (41\u00a0\u00b0F) in Reykjav\u00edk,[maps 1] which is at a similar latitude.[81]\n\n\nSea ice surrounds the island for most of the year and only disappears completely from the north coast for short, unpredictable periods from mid- to late June until the end of September.[82]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe largest summer visitor to Baffin Island is the bowhead whale.

Unlike the grey wolf in southern climes, Arctic wolves often have smaller social networks, due to the barren landscape and minimal resources, thus resulting in unique hierarchies when compared with wolves found further south. For example, Arctic wolves often do not hunt in packs, although a male-female pair may hunt together. \n\n\n\n![](image)Satellite image of Baffin Island\n![](image)An ice-covered fjord on Baffin Island, with Davis Strait in the background\n### Birds[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Islands of the Labrador Sea | * Brevoort\n* Cape Chidley\n* Christopher Hall\n* Hozier\n* Hudson\n* Ilikok\n* Jackson\n* Killiniq\n* Knight\n* Leybourne\n* Little Hall\n* Muingmak\n* Rogers\n |\n| Queen Elizabeth Islands | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Twin Cairns\n* Walton\n* Wiegand\n |\n| Islands of Cumberland Sound | * Akulagok\n* Anarnittuq\n* Aupaluktok\n* Aupaluktut\n* Blacklead\n* Clear Passage\n* Drum\n* Ekallulik\n* Iglunga\n* Imigen\n* Ivisa\n* Kaigosuit\n* Kangigutsak\n* Kekertelung\n* Kekerten\n* Kekertukdjuak\n* Kudjak\n* Maktaktujanak\n* Miliakdjuin\n* Moodie\n* Nimigen\n* Nunatak\n* Nuvujen\n* Opingivik\n* Sanigut\n* Saunik\n* Shakshukowshee\n* Shakshukuk\n* Tesseralik\n* Tuapait\n* Upajjana\n* Utaqqiurviarjuruluk\n* Utsusivik\n* Wareham\n |\n| Islands of Davis Strait | * Aggijjat\n* Akuglek\n* Alikdjuak\n* Angijak\n* *Broughton*\n* Idjuniving\n* Kekertaluk\n* Kekertuk\n* Kekerturnak\n* Manitung\n* Monumental\n* Nedlukseak\n* Nudlung\n* Nunatsiaq\n* Nuvuktik\n* Paallavvik\n* Pilektuak\n* Qaqulluit\n* Rock\n* Satigsun\n |\n| Islands of Foxe Basin | * Air Force\n* Bird\n* Bray\n* Foley\n* *Igloolik*\n* Kapuiviit\n* Koch\n* Nirlirnaqtuuq\n* North Tweedsmuir\n* Prince Charles\n* Qikiqtaarjuk\n* Rowley\n* Siuraq\n* South Tweedsmuir\n* White\n* Winter\n |\n| Islands of Frobisher Bay | * Algerine\n* Alligator\n* Anchorage\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Mary River Mine, an iron ore mine with an estimated 21-year life, at Mary River, may include building a railway and a port to transport the ore.[60] This may create a temporary mining community there.\n\n\n\n## Wildlife[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Baffin Island red fox\nBaffin Island is home to the Dewey Soper Migratory Bird Sanctuary and the Bowman Bay Wildlife Sanctuary.\n\n\nThe Dewey Soper Migratory Bird Sanctuary, named for J.

Shore birds include the phalarope, various waders (commonly called sandpipers), murres including Br\u00fcnnich's guillemot, and plovers. Gull species also nest on Baffin Island and they include Sabine's gull,[74] glaucous gull, herring gull and ivory gull.[75][76]\n\n\nLong-range travellers include the Arctic tern, which migrates from Antarctica every spring.
