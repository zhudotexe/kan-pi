In 1999, he was appointed by the trust as a design consultant for future work.[64]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe tiles themselves were manufactured by the Swedish company H\u00f6gan\u00e4s Keramik. It took three years of development to produce the effect Utzon wanted in what became known as the Sydney Tile, 120mm square. It is made from clay with a small percentage of crushed stone.[45]\n\n\nOve Arup and Partners' site engineer supervised the construction of the shells, which used an innovative adjustable steel-trussed \"erection arch\" (developed by Hornibrook's engineer Joe Bertony) to support the different roofs before completion.[36] On 6 April 1962, it was estimated that the Opera House would be completed between August 1964 and March 1965.\n\n\n\n##### Stage III: Interiors[edit]\n\n\n* ![The Concert Hall and organ](image)\n\nThe Concert Hall and organ\n* ![View from the stage of the Concert Hall](image)\n\nView from the stage of the Concert Hall\n* ![View from the stage of the Joan Sutherland Theatre](image)\n\nView from the stage of the Joan Sutherland Theatre\n* ![Interior of the Studio Theatre](image)\n\nInterior of the Studio Theatre\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n13. **^** \"Sydney Opera House short-listed for new 'Seven Wonders'\". *ABC News*.\n14. **^** Shells of the Sydney Opera House, The Royal Society of New South Wales Archived 27 September 2011 at the Wayback Machine\n15. **^** \"Roof Cladding of the Sydney Opera House\", Journal and Proceedings of the Royal Society of New South Wales, Volume 106 Parts 1 and 2, pp. 18\u201332, issued 21 November 1973 (Note: The paper is contradictory, giving both radius and diameter as over 246 ft.

The design was one of the first examples of the use of computer-aided design to design complex shapes. The design techniques developed by Utzon and Arup for the Sydney Opera House have been further developed and are now used for architecture, such as works of Gehry and blobitecture, as well as most reinforced concrete structures. The design is also one of the first in the world to use araldite to glue the precast structural elements together and proved the concept for future use.\n\n\nIt was also a first in mechanical engineering. Another Danish firm, Steensen Varming, was responsible for designing the new air-conditioning plant, the largest in Australia at the time, supplying over 600,000 cubic feet (17,000\u00a0m3) of air per minute,[61] using the innovative idea of harnessing the harbour water to create a water-cooled heat pump system that is still in operation today.[62]\n\n\n\n### Opening[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n25. **^** \"Sydney Architecture Images- Sydney Opera House\".

The architectural work was divided between three appointees who became the Hall, Todd, Littlemore partnership. David Littlemore would manage construction supervision, Lionel Todd contract documentation, while the crucial role of design became the responsibility of Peter Hall.[71]:\u200a45\n\n\nHall completed a combined arts and architecture degree at Sydney University. Upon graduation a travel scholarship enabled him to spend twelve months in Europe during which time he visited Utzon in Helleb\u00e6k.[72] Returning to Sydney, Hall worked for the Government Architect, a branch of the NSW Public Works Department. While there he established himself as a talented design architect with a number of court and university buildings, including the Goldstein Hall at the University of New South Wales, which won the Sir John Sulman Medal in 1964.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n32. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Sydney Architecture Archived 27 September 2007 at the Wayback Machine.

One of the first was that Utzon believed the clients should receive information on all aspects of the design and construction through his practice, while the clients wanted a system (notably drawn in sketch form by Davis Hughes) where architect, contractors, and engineers each reported to the client directly and separately. This had great implications for procurement methods and cost control, with Utzon wishing to negotiate contracts with chosen suppliers (such as Ralph Symonds for the plywood interiors) and the New South Wales government insisting contracts be put out to tender.[33]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n8. **^** \"How do you value an icon?

It was originally credited to Utzon. Ove Arup's letter to Ashworth, a member of the Sydney Opera House Executive Committee, states: \"Utzon came up with an idea of making all the shells of uniform curvature throughout in both directions.\"[37] Peter Jones, the author of Ove Arup's biography, states that \"the architect and his supporters alike claimed to recall the precise *eureka* moment ...; the engineers and some of their associates, with equal conviction, recall discussion in both central London and at Ove's house.\"\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDesigned by Danish architect J\u00f8rn Utzon, but completed by an Australian architectural team headed by Peter Hall, the building was formally opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 20 October 1973,[5] 16 years after Utzon's 1957 selection as winner of an international design competition. The Government of New South Wales, led by the premier, Joseph Cahill, authorised work to begin in 1958 with Utzon directing construction. The government's decision to build Utzon's design is often overshadowed by circumstances that followed, including cost and scheduling overruns as well as the architect's ultimate resignation.[6]\n\n\nThe building and its surrounds occupy the whole of Bennelong Point on Sydney Harbour, between Sydney Cove and Farm Cove, adjacent to the Sydney central business district and the Royal Botanic Gardens, and near to the Sydney Harbour Bridge.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n46. **^** \"Sydney Opera House \u2013 the Architect \u2013 Sydney Opera House\". *www.sydneyoperahouse.com*.

Few clients have been more patient or more generous than the people and the Government of NSW. One would not like history to record that this partnership was brought to an end by a fit of temper on the one side or by a fit of meanness on the other.\" On 17 March 1966, the *Herald* offered the view that:[60] \"It was not his [Utzon's] fault that a succession of Governments and the Opera House Trust should so signally have failed to impose any control or order on the project ... his concept was so daring that he himself could solve its problems only step by step ... his insistence on perfection led him to alter his design as he went along.\"\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The Concert Hall prior to renovations in 2020\nThe second stage of construction was progressing toward completion when Utzon resigned. His position was principally taken over by Peter Hall, who became largely responsible for the interior design. Other persons appointed that same year to replace Utzon were E. H. Farmer as government architect, D. S. Littlemore and Lionel Todd.\n\n\nFollowing Utzon's resignation, the acoustic advisor, Lothar Cremer, confirmed to the Sydney Opera House Executive Committee (SOHEC) that Utzon's original acoustic design allowed for only 2,000 seats in the main hall and further stated that increasing the number of seats to 3,000 as specified in the brief would be disastrous for the acoustics. According to Peter Jones, the stage designer, Martin Carr, criticised the \"shape, height and width of the stage, the physical facilities for artists, the location of the dressing rooms, the widths of doors and lifts, and the location of lighting switchboards.\"[48]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Utzon's initial sketches in 1957\nThe winner, announced in 1957, was Danish architect J\u00f8rn Utzon. Utzon's design was selected by Finnish-American architect Eero Saarinen from a final cut of 30 rejects.[27] The runner-up was a Philadelphia-based team assembled by Robert Geddes and George Qualls, both teaching at the University of Pennsylvania School of Design. They brought together a band of Penn faculty and friends from Philadelphia architectural offices, including Melvin Brecher, Warren Cunningham, Joseph Marzella, Walter Wiseman, and Leon Loschetter. Geddes, Brecher, Qualls, and Cunningham went on to found the firm GBQC Architects. The grand prize was 5,000 Australian pounds.[28] Utzon visited Sydney in 1957 to help supervise the project.[29] His office moved to Palm Beach, Sydney in February 1963.[30]\n\n\nUtzon received the Pritzker Architecture Prize, architecture's highest honour, in 2003.[31] The Pritzker Prize citation read:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nUtzon was highly reluctant to respond to questions or criticism from the client's Sydney Opera House Executive Committee (SOHEC).[56] However, he was greatly supported throughout by a member of the committee and one of the original competition judges, Harry Ingham Ashworth. Utzon was unwilling to compromise on some aspects of his designs that the clients wanted to change.\n\n\nUtzon's ability was never in doubt, despite questions raised by Davis Hughes, who attempted to portray Utzon as an impractical dreamer. Ove Arup actually stated that Utzon was \"probably the best of any I have come across in my long experience of working with architects\"[57] and: \"The Opera House could become the world's foremost contemporary masterpiece if Utzon is given his head.\"\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 29 March 2016, an original 1959 tapestry by Le Corbusier (2.18 x 3.55 metres), commissioned by Utzon to be hung in the Sydney Opera House and called *Les D\u00e9s Sont Jet\u00e9s* (The Dice Are Cast), was finally unveiled *in situ* after being owned by the Utzon family and held at their home in Denmark for over 50 years. The tapestry was bought at auction by the Sydney Opera House in June 2015. It now hangs in the building's Western Foyer and is accessible to the public.[70]\n\n\nIn the second half of 2017, the Joan Sutherland Theatre was closed to replace the stage machinery and for other works.\n\n\n\n## Architectural design role of Peter Hall[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe layout of the interiors was changed, and the stage machinery, already designed and fitted inside the major hall, was pulled out and largely thrown away, as detailed in the 1968 BBC TV documentary *Autopsy on a Dream*, which \"chronicles the full spectrum of controversy surrounding the construction of the Sydney Opera House\".[49]\n* Externally, the cladding to the podium and the paving (the podium was originally not to be clad down to the water, but to be left open).\n* The construction of the glass walls (Utzon was planning to use a system of prefabricated plywood mullions, but a different system was designed to deal with the glass).\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter the 1965 election of the Liberal Party, with Robert Askin becoming Premier of New South Wales, the relationship of client, architect, engineers and contractors became increasingly tense. Askin had been a \"vocal critic of the project prior to gaining office.\"[55] His new Minister for Public Works, Davis Hughes, was even less sympathetic. Elizabeth Farrelly, an Australian architecture critic, wrote that:\n\n\n\n\n> at an election night dinner party in Mosman, Hughes' daughter Sue Burgoyne boasted that her father would soon sack Utzon. Hughes had no interest in art, architecture or aesthetics. A fraud, as well as a philistine, he had been exposed before Parliament and dumped as Country Party leader for 19 years of falsely claiming a university degree. The Opera House gave Hughes a second chance. For him, as for Utzon, it was all about control; about the triumph of homegrown mediocrity over foreign genius.[55]\n> \n> \n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

It was commissioned in 1631 by the fifth Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan (r.\u20091628\u20131658) to house the tomb of his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAnother such unsupported theory is that the Taj Mahal was designed by an Italian, Geronimo Vereneo, held sway for a brief period after it was first promoted by Henry George Keene in 1879 who went by a translation of a Spanish work *Itinerario*, (*The Travels of Fray Sebastian Manrique, 1629\u20131643*). Another theory that a Frenchman, Austin of Bordeaux designed the Taj was promoted by William Henry Sleeman based on the work of Jean-Baptiste Tavernier. These ideas were revived by Father Hosten and discussed again by E.B. Havell and served as the basis for subsequent theories and controversies.[101]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe outlying buildings were completed in 1643.[17]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nTaj Mahal and outlying buildings as seen from across the Yamuna River (northern view)\n\n## Construction[edit]\n\n\nThe Taj Mahal is built on a parcel of land to the south of the walled city of Agra. Shah Jahan presented Maharaja Jai Singh I with a large palace in the centre of Agra in exchange for the land.[46] An area of roughly 1.2 hectares (3 acres) was excavated, filled with dirt to reduce seepage, and levelled at 50 metres (160\u00a0ft) above the riverbank level. In the tomb area, piles were dug and filled with stone and rubble to form the footings of the tomb. Instead of lashed bamboo, workmen constructed a colossal brick scaffold that mirrored the tomb. The scaffold was so enormous that foremen expected it to take years to dismantle.[47]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n19. **^** Wayne Edison Begley; Ziauddin Abdul Hayy Desai (1989). *Taj Mahal: The Illumined Tomb\u00a0: an Anthology of Seventeenth-century Mughal and European Documentary Sources*.

To this day, officials find broken bangles surrounding the silhouette.[97]\n\n\nSeveral myths, none of which are supported by the archaeological record, have appeared asserting that people other than Shah Jahan and the original architects were responsible for the construction of the Taj Mahal. For instance, in 2000, India's Supreme Court dismissed P. N. Oak's petition[98] to declare that a Hindu king built the Taj Mahal.[95][99] In 2005, a similar petition was dismissed by the Allahabad High Court. This case was brought by Amar Nath Mishra, a social worker and preacher who claimed that the Taj Mahal was built by the Hindu King Parmal Dev in 1196.[100]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAccording to Ebba Koch, art historian and international expert in the understanding and interpretation of Mughal architecture and the Taj Mahal, the planning of the entire compound of the Taj symbolises earthly life and the afterlife, a subset of the symbolisation of the divine. The plan has been split into two\u00a0\u2013 one half is the white marble mausoleum itself and the gardens, and the other half is the red sandstone side meant for worldly markets. Only the mausoleum is white so as to represent the enlightenment, spirituality and faith of Mumtaz Mahal. According to the world-traveler Eleanor Roosevelt, the white symbolised the purity of real love.[59] Koch has deciphered that symbolic of Islamic teachings, the plan of the worldly side is a mirror image of the otherworldly side, and the grand gate in the middle represents the transition between the two worlds.\n\n\nThe Taj is also seen as a feminine architectural form, and is thought to embody Mumtaz Mahal herself.[60]\n\n\n\n## Later days[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nA dark reflection of the white mausoleum could clearly be seen, befitting Shah Jahan's obsession with symmetry and the positioning of the pool itself.[92]\n\n\nNo concrete evidence exists for claims that describe, often in horrific detail, the deaths, dismemberments and mutilations which Shah Jahan supposedly inflicted on various architects and craftsmen associated with the tomb.[93][94] Some stories claim that those involved in construction signed contracts committing themselves to have no part in any similar design. Similar claims are made for many famous buildings.[95] No evidence exists for claims that Lord William Bentinck, governor-general of India in the 1830s, supposedly planned to demolish the Taj Mahal and auction off the marble. Bentinck's biographer John Rosselli says that the story arose from Bentinck's fund-raising sale of discarded marble from Agra Fort.[96]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n29. **^** \"Taj Mahal \u2013 A Monument of Love in India\". *Kristian Bertel Photography*.

The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around \u20b932\u00a0million, which in 2023 would be approximately \u20b935\u00a0billion.[7] The construction project employed some 20,000 artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by Ustad Ahmad Lahori, the emperor's court architect. Various types of symbolism have been employed in the Taj to reflect natural beauty and divinity.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe exterior decorations of the Taj Mahal are among the finest in Mughal architecture. As the surface area changes, the decorations are refined proportionally. The decorative elements were created by applying paint, stucco, stone inlays or carvings. In line with the Islamic prohibition against the use of anthropomorphic forms, the decorative elements can be grouped into either calligraphy, abstract forms or vegetative motifs.\nThroughout the complex are passages from the Qur'an that comprise some of the decorative elements. Recent scholarship suggests that Amanat Khan chose the passages.[30][31]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Taj Mahal was commissioned by Shah Jahan in 1631, to be built in the memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal, who died on 17 June that year, while giving birth to their 14th child, Gauhara Begum.[14][15] Construction started in 1632,[16] and the mausoleum was completed in 1648, while the surrounding buildings and garden were finished five years later.[17] The imperial court documenting Shah Jahan's grief after the death of Mumtaz Mahal illustrates the love story held as the inspiration for the Taj Mahal.[18] According to contemporary historians Muhammad Amin Qazvini, Abdul Hamid Lahori and Muhammad Saleh Kamboh, he did not show the same level of affection to others as he had shown her while she was alive. He avoided royal affairs for a week due to his grief, along with giving up listening to music and dressing lavishly for two years. Shah Jahan was enamored by the beauty of the land at the south side of Agra on which a mansion belonging to Raja Jai Singh I stood. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being \"the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage\". It is regarded by many as the best example of Mughal architecture and a symbol of India's rich history. The Taj Mahal attracts 7-8\u00a0million visitors a year,[8] and in 2007 it was declared a winner of the New 7 Wonders of the World (2000\u20132007) initiative.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nAbdul Hamid Lahori, in his book from 1636 *Padshahnama*, refers to the Taj Mahal as *rauza-i munawwara* (Perso-Arabic: \u0631\u0648\u0636\u0647 \u0645\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0631\u0647, *rawdah-i munawwarah*), meaning the illumined or illustrious tomb.[9]\nThe current name for the Taj Mahal is of Urdu origin, and believed to be derived from Arabic and Persian, with the words *t\u0101j mahall* meaning \"crown\" (*t\u0101j*) \"palace\" (*mahall*).[10][11][4] The name \"Taj\" came from the corruption of the second syllable of \"Mumtaz\".[12][13]\n\n\n\n## Inspiration[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn the lower walls of the tomb are white marble dados sculpted with realistic bas relief depictions of flowers and vines. The marble has been polished to emphasise the exquisite detailing of the carvings. The dado frames and archway spandrels have been decorated with pietra dura inlays of highly stylised, almost geometric vines, flowers and fruits. The inlay stones are of yellow marble, jasper and jade, polished and levelled to the surface of the walls.[32]\n\n\n\nDetailed exterior design\n* ![Taj Mahal Exterior with a minaret](image)\n\nTaj Mahal Exterior with a minaret\n* ![Detail of plant motifs on Taj Mahal wall](image)\n\nDetail of plant motifs on Taj Mahal wall\n* ![Base, dome and minaret](image)\n\nBase, dome and minaret\n* ![Finial, tamga of the Mughal Empire](image)\n\nFinial, tamga of the Mughal Empire\n* ![Plant motifs](image)\n\nPlant motifs\n* ![Reflective tiles](image)\n\nReflective tiles\n* ![Marble jali (latticed grill)](image)\n\nMarble jali (latticed grill)\n* ![Calligraphy of Arabic Ayaat](image)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs of 2017, several court cases about Taj Mahal being a Hindu temple have been inspired by P. N. Oak's theory.[102][103] In August 2017, Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) stated there was no evidence to suggest the monument ever housed a temple.[104] Bharatiya Janata Party's Vinay Katiyar in 2017 claimed that the 17th century monument was built by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan after destroying a Hindu temple called \"Tejo Mahalaya\" and it housed a Shiva linga. This claim had also been made by another BJP member Laxmikant Bajpai in 2014. The BJP government's Union Minister of Culture Mahesh Sharma stated in November 2015 during a session of the parliament, that there was no evidence that it was a temple. The theories about Taj Mahal being a Shiva temple started circulating when Oak released his 1989 book *Taj Mahal: The True Story*. He claimed it was built in 1155 AD and not in the 17th century, as stated by the ASI.[105]\n\n\n\n## Gallery[edit]\n\n\n* Taj Mahal\n* ![Eastern view in the morning](image)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe interior chamber of the Taj Mahal reaches far beyond traditional decorative elements. The inlay work is not pietra dura, but a lapidary of precious and semiprecious gemstones.[35] The inner chamber is an octagon with the design allowing for entry from each face, although only the door facing the garden to the south is used. The interior walls are about 25 metres (82\u00a0ft) high and are topped by a \"false\" interior dome decorated with a sun motif. Eight pishtaq arches define the space at ground level and, as with the exterior, each lower pishtaq is crowned by a second pishtaq about midway up the wall.[36] The four central upper arches form balconies or viewing areas, and each balcony's exterior window has an intricate screen or *jali* a grill lattice cut from marble. In addition to the light from the balcony screens, light enters through roof openings covered by chattris at the corners. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThey changed the landscaping to their liking which more closely resembled the formal lawns of London.[45]\n\n\n\n### Outlying buildings[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The western building, a mosque, faces the tomb.\nThe Taj Mahal complex is bordered on three sides by crenellated red sandstone walls; the side facing the river is open. Outside the walls are several additional mausoleums, including those of Shah Jahan's other wives, and a larger tomb for Mumtaz's favourite servant.[*citation needed*] These structures, composed primarily of red sandstone, are typical of the smaller Mughal tombs of the era. The garden-facing inner sides of the wall are fronted by columned arcades, a feature typical of Hindu temples which was later incorporated into Mughal mosques. The wall is interspersed with domed *chattris*, and small buildings that may have been viewing areas or watch towers like the Music House, which is now used as a museum.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n8. **^** \"Views of Taj Mahal\". *www.tajmahal.gov.in*.

Specific inspiration came from successful Timurid and Mughal buildings including the Gur-e Amir (the tomb of Timur, progenitor of the Mughal dynasty, in Samarkand),[20] Humayun's Tomb which inspired the Charbagh gardens and hasht-behesht (architecture) plan of the site, Itmad-Ud-Daulah's Tomb (sometimes called the *Baby Taj*), and Shah Jahan's own Jama Masjid in Delhi. While earlier Mughal buildings were primarily constructed of red sandstone, Shah Jahan promoted the use of white marble inlaid with semi-precious stones. Buildings under his patronage reached new levels of refinement.[21]\n\n\n\n### Tomb[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Al\u012b J\u0101v\u012bd, Tabassum Javeed (2008). *World Heritage Monuments and Related Edifices in India, Volume 1*.

Colorful vines and flowers decorate the interior, and are filled in with semi-precious stones using a technique called pietra dura, or as the Mughals called it, *parchin kari*.[57] The building appears to slightly change colour depending on the time of day and the weather. The sky has not only been incorporated in the design through the reflecting pools but also through the surface of the building itself.

This makes the Taj a symbolic horizon.[56]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe actual tombs of Mumtaz Mahal (right) and Shah Jahan (left) in the lower level.

Upon Shah Jahan's death, Aurangzeb buried him in the mausoleum next to his wife.[61] In the 18th century, the Jat rulers of Bharatpur invaded Agra and attacked the Taj Mahal. They took away the two chandeliers, one of agate and another of silver, which were hung over the main cenotaph; they also took the gold and silver screen. Kanbo, a Mughal historian, said the gold shield which covered the 4.6-metre-high (15\u00a0ft) finial at the top of the main dome was also removed during the Jat despoilation.[62]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n53. **^** Tillotson 2008, p.\u00a032.\n54. **^** Kinra 2015, p.\u00a0146.\n55. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Koch 2005, p.\u00a0140.\n56. **^** Sparavigna 2013, p.\u00a0106.\n57. **^** Moinifar 2013, p.\u00a0133.\n58. **^** \"Views of Taj Mahal\". *Department of Tourism, Government of Uttar Pradesh, India*. 4 December 2020.

The remaining parts of the complex took an additional 10 years and were completed in order of minarets, mosque and jawab, and gateway. Since the complex was built in stages, discrepancies exist in completion dates due to differing opinions on \"completion\". Construction of the mausoleum itself was essentially completed by 1643[16] while work on the outlying buildings continued for years. Estimates of the cost of construction vary due to difficulties in estimating costs across time. The total cost at the time has been estimated to be about \u20b9 32 million,[16] which is around \u20b9 52.8\u00a0billion ($827\u00a0million US) based on 2015 values.[52]\n\n\n\n## Symbolism[edit]\n\n\nDue to the global attention that it has received and the millions of visitors it attracts, the Taj Mahal has become a prominent image that is associated with India, and in this way has become a symbol of India itself.[53]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe tomb is the central focus of the entire complex of the Taj Mahal. It is a large, white marble structure standing on a square plinth and consists of a symmetrical building with an *iwan* (an arch-shaped doorway) topped by a large dome and finial. Like most Mughal tombs, the basic elements are Indo-Islamic in origin.[22]\n\n\nThe base structure is a large multi-chambered cube with chamfered corners forming an unequal eight-sided structure that is approximately 55 metres (180\u00a0ft) on each of the four long sides. Each side of the iwan is framed with a huge *pishtaq* or vaulted archway with two similarly shaped arched balconies stacked on either side. This motif of stacked *pishtaqs* is replicated on the chamfered corner areas, making the design completely symmetrical on all sides of the building. Four minarets frame the tomb, one at each corner of the plinth facing the chamfered corners. The main chamber houses the false sarcophagi of Mumtaz Mahal and Shah Jahan; the actual graves are at a lower level.[23]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Taj Mahal was constructed using materials from all over India and Asia. It is believed over 1,000 elephants were used to transport building materials. Some 22,000 labourers, painters, embroidery artists and stonecutters were used.[48] The translucent white marble was brought from Makrana, Rajasthan, the jasper from the Punjab region, jade and crystal from China. The turquoise was from Tibet and the Lapis lazuli from Afghanistan, while the sapphire came from Sri Lanka and the carnelian from Arabia. In all, 28 types of precious and semi-precious stone were inlaid into the white marble.[49]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nEastern view in the morning\n* ![Taj Mahal in cloudy weather and its minaret under restoration](image)\n\nTaj Mahal in cloudy weather and its minaret under restoration\n* ![Western view at sunset](image)\n\nWestern view at sunset\n* ![Taj Mahal through the fog](image)\n\nTaj Mahal through the fog\n* ![A panoramic view looking 360 degrees around the Taj Mahal in 2005](image)\n\nA panoramic view looking 360 degrees around the Taj Mahal in 2005\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)India portal\n* ![](image)Islam portal\n* ![icon](image)Architecture portal\n\n\n* Architecture of India\n* Bibi Ka Maqbara, a similar building in the Deccan, Aurangabad\n* Fatehpur Sikri, a nearby city and World Heritage Site\n* Islamic architecture\n* Indo-Islamic architecture\n* *Inside*, a 1968 new-age music album recorded in the building\n* List of tallest domes\n* List of tallest structures built before the 20th century\n* New 7 Wonders of the World\n* Taj Mahal replicas and derivatives\n* Wonders of the World\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Chaghtai, Muhammad Abdulla (1938). *Le Tadj Mahal d'Agra (Inde), histoire et description comprenant en appendice le texte d'un ms. persan sur le Tadj provenant de la Biblioth\u00e8que nationale \u00e0 Paris: th\u00e8se pour le doctorat d'Universit\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 la Facult\u00e9 des lettres de l'Universit\u00e9 de Paris, par Muhammad Abdulla Chaghtai* (Thesis). \u00c9ditions de la Connaissance.\n* Copplestone, Trewin (1963). *World architecture: an illustrated history from earliest times*.
