Aside from their core automobile and motorcycle businesses, Honda also manufactures garden equipment, marine engines, personal watercraft, power generators, and other products. Since 1986, Honda has been involved with artificial intelligence/robotics research and released their ASIMO robot in 2000. They have also ventured into aerospace with the establishment of GE Honda Aero Engines in 2004 and the Honda HA-420 HondaJet, which began production in 2012. Honda has two joint-ventures in China: Dongfeng Honda and GAC Honda.\n\n\nIn 2013, Honda invested about 5.7% (US$6.8 billion) of its revenues into research and development.[10] Also in 2013, Honda became the first Japanese automaker to be a net exporter from the United States, exporting 108,705 Honda and Acura models, while importing only 88,357.[11]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n28. **^** \"Honda Names Takahiro Hachigo New President; Replaces Takanobu Ito, who took over as chief executive in 2009\". *Wall Street Journal*. 23 February 2015.\n29. **^** News, Bloomberg (29 October 2019). \"Honda and Hitachi to Merge Four Car Parts Makers, Yomiuri Says \u2013 BNN Bloomberg\". *BNN*. `{{cite web}}`: `|last=` has generic name (help)\n30. **^** Wayland, Michael (27 January 2020). \"Coronavirus prompts automakers to evacuate workers, weigh production delays at Chinese factories\". *CNBC*.

He worked as a mechanic at the Art Shokai garage, where he tuned cars and entered them in races. In 1937, with financing from his acquaintance Kato Shichir\u014d, Honda founded T\u014dkai Seiki (Eastern Sea Precision Machine Company) to make piston rings working out of the Art Shokai garage.[12] After initial failures, T\u014dkai Seiki won a contract to supply piston rings to Toyota, but lost the contract due to the poor quality of their products.[12] After attending engineering school without graduating, and visiting factories around Japan to better understand Toyota's quality control processes known as \"Five whys\", by 1941 Honda was able to mass-produce piston rings acceptable to Toyota, using an automated process that could employ even unskilled wartime laborers.[12][13]:\u200a16\u201319\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Honda Motor Co., Ltd.** (\u672c\u7530\u6280\u7814\u5de5\u696d\u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e, *Honda Giken K\u014dgy\u014d Kabushiki gaisha*, lit.\u2009'Honda Institute of Technology and Industry Company', IPA: [honda] \u24d8; /\u02c8h\u0252nd\u0259/) is a Japanese public multinational conglomerate manufacturer of automobiles, motorcycles, and power equipment, headquartered in Minato, Tokyo, Japan.\n\n\nHonda has been the world's largest motorcycle manufacturer since 1959,[3][4] reaching a production of 400 million by the end of 2019.[5] It is also the world's largest manufacturer of internal combustion engines measured by volume, producing more than 14 million internal combustion engines each year.[6] Honda became the second-largest Japanese automobile manufacturer in 2001.[7][8] In 2015, Honda was the eighth largest automobile manufacturer in the world.[9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHonda Motor Co., Ltd.| ![](image) |\n| ![](image)Headquarters in Minato, Tokyo\n |\n| Native name\n | \u672c\u7530\u6280\u7814\u5de5\u696d\u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e |\n| Romanized name\n | *Honda Giken K\u014dgy\u014d Kabushiki-gaisha* |\n| Company type | Public |\n| Traded as\n | * TYO: 7267\n* NYSE:\u00a0HMC\n* Nikkei 225 component (7267)\n* TOPIX Core30 component (7267)\n |\n| Industry | Manufacturing |\n| Founded | Hamamatsu, Japan (October\u00a01946\u00a0(1946-10), incorporated 24\u00a0September 1948; 75 years ago\u00a0(1948-09-24)) |\n| Founder | Soichiro Honda |\n| Headquarters | Minato, Tokyo\n, Japan\n |\n| Area served\n | Worldwide |\n| Key people\n | * Seiji Kuraishi(Chairman)\n* Toshihiro Mibe(President\u200b\u00a0and CEO)\n |\n| Products | * Automobiles\n* Commercial vehicles\n* Luxury cars\n* Motorcycles\n* Scooters\n* Electric generators\n* Water pumps\n* Lawn and garden equipment\n* Rotary tillers\n* Outboard motors\n* Robotics\n* Jet aircraft\n* Jet engines\n* Thin-film solar cells\n* Internavi (telematics)\n |\n| Revenue | ![Increase](image) \u00a514.95 trillion (2022)[1] |\n| Operating income\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
