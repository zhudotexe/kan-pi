At that time, the survey only counted islands with coastlines of 100 meters or more that were shown on paper maps.\nOn February 28, 2023, the Geospatial Information Authority of Japan announced that the number of islands had been updated to 14,125 through a recount using digital maps. Since there is no international standard for counting islands, only islands with a coastline of 100 meters or more were counted, as in the past.
