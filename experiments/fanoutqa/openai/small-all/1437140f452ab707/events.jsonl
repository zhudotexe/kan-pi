Registered Democrats hold a formidable 7-to-1 ratio over registered Republicans in Philadelphia, giving Democratic candidates a distinct advantage in citywide elections. The mayoral primary elections were held on May 19, 2015. Kenney won the primary in a landslide with 55.83% of the vote, defeating a crowded field of five other Democratic candidates, including Anthony H. Williams and former District Attorney Lynn Abraham. Republican Melissa Murray Bailey, a business executive, ran unopposed for the Republican nomination. Kenney won with 85.1% of the vote.[12] Kenney was inaugurated as the 99th Mayor of Philadelphia on January 4, 2016.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMayor of Philadelphia since 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Jim Kenney\n |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) |\n|  |\n| 99th Mayor of Philadelphia |\n| **Incumbent**\n |\n| **Assumed office** January 4, 2016 |\n| Preceded by | Michael Nutter |\n| Member of the Philadelphia City Councilfrom the at-large district |\n| **In office**January 6, 1992 – January 29, 2015 |\n| Preceded by | George Burrell |\n|  |\n| Personal details |\n| Born | James Francis Kenney\n (1958-08-07) August 7, 1958 (age 65)Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S. |\n| Political party | Democratic |\n| Education | La Salle University (BA) |\n| Website | Campaign website |\n|  |\n\n\n**James Francis Kenney** (born August 7, 1958) is an American politician who is the 99th Mayor of Philadelphia.

He was first elected to a term beginning on January 3, 2000, and was re-elected to a second term beginning in 2004. He is a Democrat and became mayor after having served 19 years in the Philadelphia City Council, including seven years as its president, before resigning as required under the Philadelphia City Charter in order to run for mayor. He followed Ed Rendell as mayor, assuming the post on January 3, 2000. Street was Philadelphia's second black mayor.\n\n\nStreet floated the possibility of being a candidate for statewide office in Pennsylvania. In light of corruption scandals, those prospects never materialized. *Time Magazine* listed him as one of the three worst big-city mayors in the United States in 2005.[4]\n\n\n\n\n## Biography and early career[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n16. **^** LOVE Park, Philadelphia PA Archived 2007-07-15 at the Wayback Machine\n17. **^** \"Northeast Times\".

Street, working closely with former Mayor Ed Rendell, was instrumental in crafting and implementing a financial plan that passed Council unanimously, and turned a $250 million deficit into the largest surplus in city history. Despite decreasing the business and wage tax four years in a row, Philadelphia still has the 10th largest tax burden in the United States. This is due to the financial burden to run the city's prisons, pay debt service, and employee pensions and health benefits.[7]\n\n\n\n## Mayor of Philadelphia[edit]\n\n\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\n#### 1999[edit]\n\n\nStreet was elected in one of the closest elections in Philadelphia history, defeating Republican Sam Katz by a margin of fewer than 7,500.[8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n33. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"PHA to pay $8M, take back local control\".

The author was given practically unlimited access to the mayor during that term. *The New York Times* called Rendell's job as mayor \"the most stunning turnaround in recent urban history\" due to his determination, inspiration, ambition, and his energy.[15]\n\n\nIn 1996, Rendell signed an executive order, 2-96, which allowed same-sex couples of Philadelphia health benefits.[16][17]\n\n\nTo date, Rendell is the last Philadelphia Mayor to not have previously served as member of Philadelphia City Council.\n\n\n\n## 2002 gubernatorial campaign[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2002 Pennsylvania gubernatorial election\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs mayor, Rendell inherited massive fiscal problems. The state legislature established a fiscal oversight board to monitor the City of Philadelphia's fiscal issues. During his career as mayor, Rendell cut a $250 million deficit, balanced Philadelphia's budget and oversaw five consecutive years of budget surpluses, reduced business and wage taxes for four consecutive years, implemented new revenue-generating initiatives, and dramatically improved services to Philadelphia neighborhoods. He was given the nickname \"Philadelphia's Renaissance or Revival\" because of how well he did with the budget.[13] He also appointed Philadelphia's first ever Latino deputy mayors, Benjamin Ramos and Manuel Ortiz. Rendell's cost-cutting policies brought him strong opposition from labor unions; however, he was re-elected in 1995, defeating Republican Joe Rocks with 80% of the vote.[14]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nElected Mayor of Philadelphia in 1991, he inherited a $250 million deficit and the lowest credit rating of any major city in the country. As mayor, he balanced Philadelphia's budget and generated a budget surplus while cutting business and wage taxes and dramatically improving services to Philadelphia neighborhoods. *The New York Times* stated that Philadelphia under Rendell \"has made one of the most stunning turnarounds in recent urban history.\"[2] Nicknamed \"America's Mayor\" by Al Gore,[3] Rendell served as Chairman of the Democratic National Committee during the 2000 presidential election.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nGovernors and presidents of Pennsylvania\n |\n| --- |\n| Presidents(1777–1790) | * Wharton\n* Bryan\n* Reed\n* Moore\n* Dickinson\n* Franklin\n* Mifflin\n | ![](image)\n |\n| Governors(since 1790) | * Mifflin\n* McKean\n* Snyder\n* Findlay\n* Hiester\n* Shulze\n* G.

Once, he yelled in the governor's face for releasing a certain prisoner. It has been said that Rendell would even punch walls or throw furniture when he became upset. In 1980, Rendell received 28 delegate votes for Vice President[8] at the Democratic National Convention, although he was not a candidate. He served two terms as DA before leaving in 1986 to run for Governor of Pennsylvania.[9] He was defeated in the Democratic gubernatorial primary by Bob Casey, Sr.[10]\n\n\nIn 1982, during his second term, Rendell presided over the controversial prosecution of Mumia Abu-Jamal, resulting in a death sentence that was overturned in 2011. The 1985 bombing of the Black religious community MOVE by the Philadelphia police also occurred during Rendell's tenure and killed 6 adults plus 5 children and caused a fire that left hundreds of neighbors homeless.[11]\n\n\n\n## Mayor of Philadelphia[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Rendell, Ed (June 5, 2012). *A Nation of Wusses: How America's Leaders Lost the Guts to Make Us Great*.

He served from 1984 to 1992, a period which included the controversial MOVE police action and house bombing in 1985. Goode was also a community activist, chair of the state Public Utility Commission, and managing director for the City of Philadelphia.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nGoode was born into a family of tenant farmers near Seaboard, North Carolina.[1] His family arrived in Philadelphia in 1953 and lived in the Paschall neighborhood in Southwest Philadelphia. He was an honors student at John Bartram High School and then he graduated from Morgan State University in 1961. He was a member of the Reserve Officers Training Corps while attending Morgan State and entered the US Army as a First Lieutenant in the military police. He returned to Philadelphia and briefly worked as a manager at a building maintenance firm and as an insurance adjuster before he was hired by the Philadelphia Council for Community Development in 1967. He became executive director of PCCD in 1971. In 1967 he and his wife bought a house in the Paschall neighborhood, where he served as a deacon of Paschall's First Baptist Church. In 1968, he completed his graduate studies at the Fels Institute of Government at the University of Pennsylvania where he earned his master's in Public Administration.[2]\n\n\n\n## Service with the Public Utility Commission[edit]\n\n\nAfter African-American state senators complained that there had never been an African-American member of the state Public Utility Commission (PUC), Governor Milton Shapp began actively searching for one. His aide, Terry Dellmuth, knew Goode from his community and political activities and recommended him.\n\n\nAs a PUC commissioner, Goode met with community groups around the state, studied relevant issues, compiled what was seen as a pro-consumer record, and forged good working relations with his fellow commissioners. He was soon elevated to the chairmanship of the PUC, where he continued his pro-consumer policies but worked to limit PUC expenditures.\n\n\n\n## Work in the Office of the Mayor[edit]\n\n\nPhiladelphia Mayor Bill Green, who had been elected in November 1979, had promised to appoint a black managing director after winning a racially divisive Democratic primary against former deputy mayor Charles Bowser. Green kept his promise by appointing Goode as managing director at the urging of key members of the black community. [*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Mayor of Philadelphia[edit]\n\n\nBefore the primary election of 1983, Green decided not to seek reelection. Goode jumped into the race and defeated former Mayor Frank Rizzo in a racially polarized primary election. Goode went on to win the general election over former Green fund-raiser and Philadelphia Stock Exchange Chairman John Egan, the Republican Party nominee.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nGoode's tenure as mayor was marred in 1985 by the MOVE Bombing, in which police attempted to clear a building in West Philadelphia inhabited by MOVE, a radical back-to-nature group, whose members, under the leadership of founder John Africa, had long defied city officials by yelling slogans and statements from a megaphone, ignoring city sanitation codes, assaulting neighbors, and resisting law enforcement officers.[3] During the attempt to evacuate the compound, police used tear gas, leading to members of MOVE opening fire on them. During the final assault on the building, the police dropped an improvised bomb made of C-4 plastic explosive and Tovex, an explosive gel used in underwater mining, onto to a bunker-like cubicle on the roof of the building. This caused the house to catch fire, and ignited a massive blaze which eventually consumed almost 4 city blocks, killed 11 people, and left 240 people homeless.[4]\n\n\nIn 1987 Goode ran for reelection, winning the Democratic primary before facing off in the general election against former mayor Frank Rizzo, who had converted to the Republican Party after losing the 1983 Democratic primary to Goode. Goode defeated Rizzo 51%-49% to earn a second term.\n\n\n\n## Post-mayoral life[edit]\n\n\nGoode stayed active after leaving office as mayor by holding a position in the U.S. Department of Education. He earned a Doctor of Ministry at Palmer Theological Seminary,[5] and became a minister and professor at Eastern University, as well as a leader of advocacy for faith-based initiatives. He currently serves as CEO of Amachi, a mentoring program for children of incarcerated parents. He was awarded the Purpose Prize, a $100,000 award given to exceptional individuals over age 60 who are working to address critical social problems.\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Holst, Arthur Matthew (2013). \"Goode, W.
