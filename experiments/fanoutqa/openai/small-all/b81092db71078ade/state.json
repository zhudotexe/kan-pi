The ranking was based upon assets as reported and was not adjusted for different accounting treatments.[2] Another publication which has the goal to compile a yearly list of the world largest banks is The Banker Magazine. Every year in their July number a list of the World 1000 Largest Banks is published.[3] The financial data published by the July yearly issue of The Banker are much more extensive compared to the S&P Top 100 banks, but it's not a publication intended for the general public.\n\n\nAccounting treatment affects the assets reported: for example, the United States uses US GAAP (as opposed to IFRS), which only reports the net derivative position in most cases, leading to US banks having fewer derivative assets than comparable non-US banks.[4] If JPMorgan Chase reported under the IFRS, it would be ranked 2nd on the list as of 2023[update], rather than 5th.[2]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Rank\n | Bank name\n | Total assets(2022)(US$ billion)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | ![China](image) Industrial and

The bank was founded in San Francisco, California. It is the second-largest banking institution in the United States, after JPMorgan Chase, and the second-largest bank in the world by market capitalization. Bank of America is one of the Big Four banking institutions of the United States.[5] It serves approximately 10.73% of all American bank deposits, in direct competition with JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo. Its primary financial services revolve around commercial banking, wealth management, and investment banking.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring 2011, Bank of America began conducting personnel reductions of an estimated 36,000 people, contributing to intended savings of $5 billion per year by 2014.[92] In December 2011, *Forbes* ranked Bank of America's financial wealth 91st out of the nation's largest 100 banks and thrift institutions.[93]\n\n\nBank of America cut around 16,000 jobs in a quicker fashion by the end of 2012 as revenue continued to decline because of new regulations and a slow economy. This put a plan one year ahead of time to eliminate 30,000 jobs under a cost-cutting program, called Project New BAC.[94] In the first quarter of 2014, Berkshire bank purchased 20 Bank of America branches in Central and eastern New York for 14.4 million dollars. The branches were from Utica/Rome region and down the Mohawk Valley east to the capital region. In April and May 2014, Bank of America sold two dozen branches in Michigan to Huntington Bancshares. The locations were converted to Huntington National Bank branches in September.[95]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* credit cards\n* equities trading\n* insurance\n* investment management\n* mortgage loans\n* mutual funds\n* private equity\n* risk management\n* wealth management\n |\n| Revenue | ![Increase](image) US$94.95 billion (2022) |\n| Operating income\n | ![Decrease](image) US$30.98 billion (2022) |\n| Net income\n | ![Decrease](image) US$27.53 billion (2022) |\n| AUM | ![Increase](image) US$1.4 trillion (March 31, 2023)[1] |\n| Total assets | ![Increase](image) US$3.1 trillion (March 31, 2023)[2] |\n| Total equity | ![Increase](image) US$273.2 billion (2022) |\n| Owners | Berkshire Hathaway (12.8%) |\n| Number of employees\n | c.\u2009217,000 (2022) |\n| Divisions | * BofA Securities\n* Merrill\n* Bank of America Private Bank\n |\n| Website | bankofamerica.com |\n| **Footnotes\u00a0/ references**[3][4] |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs part of its new strategy Bank of America is focused on growing its mobile banking platform. As of 2014[update], Bank of America has 31 million active online users and 16 million mobile users. Its retail banking branches have decreased to 4,900 as a result of increased mobile banking use and a decline in customer branch visits. By 2018, the number of mobile users has increased to 25.3 million and the number of locations fell to 4,411 at the end of June.[96]\n\n\n\n#### Sale of stake in China Construction Bank[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe bank's large market share, business activities, and economic impact has led to numerous lawsuits and investigations regarding both mortgages and financial disclosures dating back to the 2008 financial crisis. Its corporate practices of servicing the middle class and wider banking community have yielded a substantial market share since the early 20th century. As of August\u00a02018[update], Bank of America has a $313.5 billion market capitalization, making it the 13th largest company in the world. As the sixth largest American public company, it garnered $102.98 billion in sales as of June\u00a02018[update].[11] Bank of America was ranked #25 on the 2020 Fortune 500 rankings of the largest US corporations by total revenue.[12] Likewise, Bank of America was also ranked #6 on the 2023 Global 2000 rankings done by Forbes.[13] Bank of America was named the \"World's Best Bank\" by the *Euromoney Institutional Investor* in its 2018 Awards for Excellence.[14][15]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"in PDF on page 2 (Assets Under Management)\" (PDF). *bankofamerica.com*.\n2. **^** \"in PDF on page 6 (Total Assets)\" (PDF). *bankofamerica.com*.\n3. **^** \"Bank of America Corp 2022 Annual Report (Form 10-K)\".

As the 2005 annual report records, just under 5% of loans are classified as non-performing, in comparison with the majority of western banks who have lower NPL ratios (US commercial banks are typically around 1%).[61]\n\n\n\n## Board of directors[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 20 May 2011, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd. established two branches in Pakistan, one in Karachi, the other in Islamabad.

It was the world's largest IPO at that time valued at US$21.9\u00a0billion, surpassing the previous record US$18.4\u00a0billion IPO by Japan's NTT DoCoMo in 1998.[30] In 2010, Agricultural Bank of China broke ICBC's IPO record when it raised $22.1\u00a0billion. China's largest commercial bank was also the first company to debut simultaneously on both the Hong Kong and Shanghai stock exchanges.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nICBC has the policy[48] of preparing accounts conforming to the[8] International Financial Reporting Standards,[49][8] accepting specifically criteria IFRS 9 (pertains to the definition and rating of asset, liability, and a number of all of the existing purchasing contracts for non-financial purchases[50]) from 1 January 2018. and IFRS 16 (pertaining to lease[51]) from 1 January 2019.[48]\n\n\n\n### Basic figures[edit]\n\n\n#### 2005[edit]\n\n\nIn 2005, net profit was up 12.4% to RMB 33.7\u00a0billion, and the total loan balance was RMB 3,289.5\u00a0billion. Total liabilities are RMB 6,196.2\u00a0billion, up 11.2%. Delinquent or non-performing loans (NPL) total RMB 154.4\u00a0billion, a significant reduction although the figures are widely regarded as being somewhat higher than officially stated. It has an NPL ratio of 4.69% and a capital adequacy ratio of 9.89%.\n\n\n\n#### Summary[edit]\n\n\n##### 2003\u20132018[edit]\n\n\nFinancials in Renminbi[5][52][53][54][55][56][57]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nICBC Financial Services, the bank's brokerage unit, provided about $88\u00a0billion of repo financing at the end of 2015, up from $59\u00a0billion two years ago, according to regulatory filings. The figures are before netting agreements that can be used to reduce overall assets and liabilities. Almost all the repo financing that ICBC provides is on U.S. government bonds.[42]\n\n\nICBC launched robo-advisor service to its wealth-management operations in 2017.[43][44]\n\n\nIn October 2017, the Bank reported a 3.3 percent rise in its net profit for the third quarter.[45]\n\n\nICBC reported 10.3 pct growth in its profit along with exceptional growth in its revenue during the year 2021. This was caused by the gradual recovery of the Chinese economy after the COVID-19 pandemic.[46]\n\n\nIn November 2023, the bank was subject to a ransomware attack, preventing certain trades from clearing.[47]\n\n\n\n## Finances[edit]\n\n\n### Accounting[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring July 2007 ICBC was ranked 30th in the world in terms of revenue.[31]\n\n\n\n#### Foreign activity[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2008, ICBC became the second Chinese bank since 1991 to gain federal approval to establish a branch in New York City.[32] ICBC had signed a lease with the Trump Organization for office space in the Trump Tower in 2008. ICBC was Trump Tower's largest office tenant as of 2012.[33] By October 2020, Donald Trump received $5.4 million from ICBC via the Trump Tower lease.[34]\n\n\nICBC loans $400\u00a0million towards the completion of the Gibe III dam in Ethiopia.

Due to heavy subscriptions, the greenshoe (i.e. over-allotment) placements were exercised and ICBC's take rose to US$21.9\u00a0billion (17% of ICBC's market value before the IPO), divided in US$16\u00a0billion in Hong Kong and US$5.9\u00a0billion in Shanghai. Following the global offering, the free float of shares was 22.14% of the market capitalization.\n\n\nAt the end of its first day of trading, the bank's shares closed up almost 15% at HK$3.52 in Hong Kong, compared with the listing price of HK$3.07, which was set at the top of the indicative range due to the strong demand. According to Bloomberg, ICBC's market capitalisation at the end of trade based on its Hong Kong shares was US$156.3\u00a0billion, making its equity the world's fifth highest among banks, just behind JPMorgan Chase.

It was founded on 10 July 1951, and has its headquarters in Dongcheng District, Beijing.[4] It has branches throughout mainland China, Hong Kong, London, Tokyo, New York, Frankfurt, Sydney, Seoul, and Singapore.\n\n\nABC has 320 million retail customers, 2.7 million corporate clients, and nearly 24,000 branches. It is China's third-largest lender by assets. ABC went public in mid-2010, fetching the world's biggest ever initial public offering (IPO) at the time,[5] since overtaken by the Saudi Arabian state-run petroleum enterprise, Saudi Aramco.[6] In 2011, it ranked eighth among the Top 1000 World Banks,[7] by 2015, it ranked third in Forbes' 13th annual Global 2000 list[8] and in 2017 it ranked fifth.[9] It is considered a systemically important bank by the Financial Stability Board.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nSince the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, ABC has been formed and abolished several times. On July 10, 1951, two banks of the Republic of China, Farmers Bank of China and Cooperation Bank, merged to form the Agricultural Cooperation Bank, which ABC regards as its ancestor. However, the bank was merged into People's Bank of China, the central bank in 1952. The first bank bearing the name Agricultural Bank of China was founded in 1955, but it was merged into the central bank in 1957. In 1963 the Chinese government formed another agricultural bank which was also merged into the central bank two years later. Today's Agricultural Bank of China was founded in February 1979. As the People's Bank of China began spinning off its commercial banking functions after 1978, ABC's focus on providing farmers with financial services increased.[10]:\u200a225\n\n\nABC was restructured to form a holding company called Agricultural Bank of China Limited.[11] It was listed on the Shanghai and Hong Kong stock exchanges in July 2010.[12]\n\n\nIn April 2007, ABC was the victim of the largest bank theft in Chinese history. This occurred when two vault managers at the Handan branch of the bank in Hebei province embezzled almost 51 million yuan (US$7.5 million).[13]\n\n\nIn 2012, ABC started a project to migrate to the Avaloq Banking System.[14][15]\n\n\nDuring the 2013 Korean crisis, the Agricultural Bank of China halted business with a North Korean bank accused by the United States of financing Pyongyang's missile and nuclear programs.[16]\n\n\n\n## 2010 initial public offering[edit]\n\n\nABC was the last of the \"big four\" banks in China to go public. In 2010, A shares and H shares of Agricultural Bank of China were listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange respectively. Each share was set to cost between 2.7RMB and 3.3RMB per share.[17] H shares were set to cost between HK$2.88 and HK$3.48 per share.[18] The final share price for the IPO launch was issued on July 7, 2010. On completion in August 2010 it became the world's biggest initial public offering (IPO) surpassing the one set by Industrial and Commercial Bank of China in 2006 of US$21.9 billion.[19] This record has since been beaten by another Chinese company, Alibaba, in 2014.[20]\n\n\nABC raised US$19.21 billion in an IPO in Hong Kong and Shanghai on July 6, 2010, before overallotment options were exercised.[21] On August 13, 2010, ABC officially completed the world's largest initial public offering, raising a total of $22.1 billion after both Shanghai and Hong Kong's over-allotments were fully exercised.[22][23] The IPO was once thought to be able to raise US$30 billion, but weaker market sentiment dampened the value.[24] Despite a 15-month low for the Chinese benchmark index, the IPO was said to have gone smoothly.[25]\n\n\nCICC, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley led the Hong Kong offering, with JPMorgan, Macquarie, Deutsche Bank and ABC's own securities unit also involved. CICC, CITIC Securities, Galaxy and Guotai Junan Securities handled the Shanghai portion. ABC sold about 40% of the Shanghai offering to 27 strategic investors, including China Life Insurance and China State Construction. They were subject to lock-up periods of 12\u201318 months. Eleven cornerstone investors were selected for its Hong Kong share offering, including Qatar Investment Authority and Kuwait Investment Authority, taking a combined $5.45 billion worth of shares.[26]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Companies portal\n* ![icon](image)Banks portal\n\n\n* Asset management in China\n* Banking in China\n\t+ Policy banks\n\t+ List of banks in China\n* List of companies of China\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** \"Annual Report 2018\".
