Besides the *Star Wars* and *Superman* franchises, *James Bond* and *Godzilla* films are still being released periodically; all four are among the highest-grossing franchises. Some of the older films that held the record of highest-grossing film still have respectable grosses by today's standards, but no longer compete numerically against today's top-earners in an era of much higher individual ticket prices. When those prices are adjusted for inflation, however, then *Gone with the Wind*\u2014which was the highest-grossing film outright for twenty-five years\u2014is still the highest-grossing film of all time. All grosses on the list are expressed in U.S. dollars at their nominal value, except where stated otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n## Highest-grossing films[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn this chart, films are ranked by the revenues from theatrical exhibition at their nominal value, along with the highest positions they attained. Six films in total have grossed in excess of $2\u00a0billion worldwide, with *Avatar* ranked in the top position. All of the films have had a theatrical run (including re-releases) in the 21st century, and films that have not played during this period do not appear on the chart because of ticket-price inflation, population size and ticket purchasing trends not being considered.\n\n\n\n\n\u2020 *Background shading indicates films playing in the week commencing 13 June 2024 in theaters around the world*.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHighest-grossing films[12]\n| Rank\n | Peak\n | Title\n | Worldwide gross\n | Year\n | Reference(s)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | 1\n | *Avatar* | $2,923,706,026\n | 2009\n | [# 1][# 2] |\n| 2\n | 1\n | *Avengers: Endgame* | $2,797,501,328\n | 2019\n | [# 3][# 4] |\n| 3\n | 3\n | *Avatar: The Way of Water* | $2,320,250,281\n | 2022\n | [# 5][# 6] |\n| 4\n | 1\n | *Titanic* | T$2,257,844,554\n | 1997\n | [# 7][# 8] |\n| 5\n | 3\n | *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* | $2,068,223,624\n | 2015\n | [# 9][# 10] |\n| 6\n | 4\n | *Avengers: Infinity War* | $2,048,359,754\n | 2018\n | [# 11][# 12] |\n| 7\n | 6\n | *Spider-Man: No Way Home* | $1,921,847,111\n | 2021\n | [# 13][# 14] |\n| 8\n | 3\n | *Jurassic World* | $1,671,537,444\n | 2015\n | [# 15][# 16] |\n| 9\n | 7\n | *The Lion King* | $1,656,943,394\n | 2019\n | [# 17][# 4] |\n| 10\n | 3\n | *The Avengers* | $1,518,815,515\n | 2012\n | [# 18][# 19] |\n| 11\n | 4\n | *Furious 7* | $1,515,341,399\n | 2015\n | [# 20][# 21] |\n| 12\n | 11\n | *Top Gun: Maverick* | $1,495,696,292\n | 2022\n | [# 22][# 23] |\n| 13\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFilms generate income from several revenue streams, including theatrical exhibition, home video, television broadcast rights, and merchandising. However, theatrical box-office earnings are the primary metric for trade publications in assessing the success of a film, mostly because of the availability of the data compared to sales figures for home video and broadcast rights, but also because of historical practice. Included on the list are charts of the top box-office earners (ranked by both the nominal and real value of their revenue), a chart of high-grossing films by calendar year, a timeline showing the transition of the highest-grossing film record, and a chart of the highest-grossing film franchises and series. All charts are ranked by international theatrical box-office performance where possible, excluding income derived from home video, broadcasting rights, and merchandise.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t+ \"X-Men \u2013 Worldwide (Unadjusted)\". *Box Office Mojo*.

Grosses are not limited to original theatrical runs either, with many older films often being re-released periodically so the figures represent all the business a film has done since its original release; a film's first-run gross is included in brackets after the total if known. Because of incomplete data it cannot be known for sure how much money some films have made and when they made it, but generally the chart chronicles the films from each year that went on to earn the most. In the cases where estimates conflict both films are recorded, and in cases where a film has moved into first place because of being re-released the previous record-holder is also retained.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Pincus-Roth, Zachary (January 8, 2006). \"Movies aren't the only B.O. monsters\". *Variety*.

After listing it until the mid-1970s as *the* top-grosser, though finding it impossible to quote exact figures, *Variety*, the trade journal, suddenly repudiated the claim but without giving specific details or reasons.
