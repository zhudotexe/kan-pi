They are regarded as the most influential band of all time[1] and were integral to the development of 1960s counterculture and the recognition of popular music as an art form.[2] Rooted in skiffle, beat, and 1950s rock 'n' roll, their sound incorporated elements of classical music and traditional pop in innovative ways. The band also explored music styles ranging from folk and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock. As pioneers in recording, songwriting, and artistic presentation, the Beatles revolutionised many aspects of the music industry and were often publicised as leaders of the era's youth and sociocultural movements.[3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAt a press conference, Lennon pointed out, \"If I'd said television was more popular than Jesus, I might have got away with it.\"[178] He claimed that he was referring to how other people viewed their success, but at the prompting of reporters, he concluded: \"If you want me to apologise, if that will make you happy, then okay, I'm sorry.\"[178]\n\n\n\n![](image)\n\n\"Eleanor Rigby\"\n\n\nSample of \"Eleanor Rigby\" from *Revolver* (1966).

See media help.*\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLed by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, the Beatles evolved from Lennon's previous group, the Quarrymen, and built their reputation by playing clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg over three years from 1960, initially with Stuart Sutcliffe playing bass. The core trio of Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison, together since 1958, went through a succession of drummers, including Pete Best, before inviting Starr to join them in 1962. Manager Brian Epstein moulded them into a professional act, and producer George Martin guided and developed their recordings, greatly expanding their domestic success after they signed with EMI Records and achieved their first hit, \"Love Me Do\", in late 1962. As their popularity grew into the intense fan frenzy dubbed \"Beatlemania\", the band acquired the nickname \"the Fab Four\". Epstein, Martin or another member of the band's entourage was sometimes informally referred to as a \"fifth Beatle\".\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBy January 1959, Lennon's Quarry Bank friends had left the group, and he began his studies at the Liverpool College of Art.[12] The three guitarists, billing themselves as Johnny and the Moondogs,[13] were playing rock and roll whenever they could find a drummer.[14] Lennon's art school friend Stuart Sutcliffe, who had just sold one of his paintings and was persuaded to purchase a bass guitar with the proceeds, joined in January 1960. He suggested changing the band's name to *Beatals*, as a tribute to Buddy Holly and the Crickets.[15][16] They used this name until May, when they became the Silver Beetles, before undertaking a brief tour of Scotland as the backing group for pop singer and fellow Liverpudlian Johnny Gentle. By early July, they had refashioned themselves as the Silver Beatles, and by the middle of August simply *the Beatles*.[17]\n\n\n\n#### Early residencies and UK popularity[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Lennon said of Epstein, \"We used to dress how we liked, on and off stage. He'd tell us that jeans were not particularly smart and could we possibly manage to wear proper trousers, but he didn't want us suddenly looking square. He'd let us have our own sense of individuality.\"[41]\n2. **^** \"She Loves You\" was surpassed in sales by \"Mull of Kintyre\", by McCartney's post-Beatles band Wings.[64]\n3. **^** Vee-Jay company president Ewart Abner resigned after it was disclosed he used company funds to cover gambling debts.[86]\n4. **^** During the same week in April 1964, a third American Beatles LP joined the two already in circulation; two of the three reached the first spot on the *Billboard* albums chart, the third peaked at number two.[107]\n5. **^** Harrison's ringing 12-string inspired Roger McGuinn, who obtained his own Rickenbacker and used it to craft the trademark sound of the Byrds.[113]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nmore than any other artist.[455] They were collectively included in *Time* magazine's compilation of the 20th century's 100 most influential people.[456] In 2014, they received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.[457]\n\n\nOn 16 January each year, beginning in 2001, people celebrate World Beatles Day under UNESCO.

The completion and mixing of \"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\" on 20 August was the last occasion on which all four Beatles were together in the same studio.[287] On 8 September, while Starr was in hospital, the other band members met to discuss recording a new album. They considered a different approach to songwriting by ending the Lennon–McCartney pretence and having four compositions apiece from Lennon, McCartney and Harrison, with two from Starr and a lead single around Christmas.[288] On 20 September, Lennon announced his departure to the rest of the group but agreed to withhold a public announcement to avoid undermining sales of the forthcoming album.[289]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\na giant step toward reshaping the concert business\".[440] Emulation of their clothing and especially their hairstyles, which became a mark of rebellion, had a global impact on fashion.[103]\n\n\nAccording to Gould, the Beatles changed the way people listened to popular music and experienced its role in their lives. From what began as the Beatlemania fad, the group's popularity grew into what was seen as an embodiment of sociocultural movements of the decade. As icons of the 1960s counterculture, Gould continues, they became a catalyst for bohemianism and activism in various social and political arenas, fuelling movements such as women's liberation, gay liberation and environmentalism.[441] According to Peter Lavezzoli, after the \"more popular than Jesus\" controversy in 1966, the Beatles felt considerable pressure to say the right things and \"began a concerted effort to spread a message of wisdom and higher consciousness\".[169]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPepper*, the underground and mainstream press widely publicised the Beatles as leaders of youth culture, as well as \"lifestyle revolutionaries\".[3] The album was the first major pop/rock LP to include its complete lyrics, which appeared on the back cover.[202][203] Those lyrics were the subject of critical analysis; for instance, in late 1967 the album was the subject of a scholarly inquiry by American literary critic and professor of English Richard Poirier, who observed that his students were \"listening to the group's music with a degree of engagement that he, as a teacher of literature, could only envy\".[204][nb 8] The elaborate cover also attracted considerable interest and study.[205] A collage designed by pop artists Peter Blake and Jann Haworth, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n348. **^** Hurwitz, Matt (1 January 2004). \"The Naked Truth About The Beatles' Let It BeNaked [*sic*]\". *Mix*.

Gould observes: \"The more traditional sound of strings allowed for a fresh appreciation of their talent as composers by listeners who were otherwise allergic to the din of drums and electric guitars.\"[408] They continued to experiment with string arrangements to various effect; *Sgt. Pepper*'s \"She's Leaving Home\", for instance, is \"cast in the mold of a sentimental Victorian ballad\", Gould writes, \"its words and music filled with the clichés of musical melodrama\".[409]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBy early 1964, the Beatles were international stars and had achieved unprecedented levels of critical and commercial success. They became a leading force in Britain's cultural resurgence, ushering in the British Invasion of the United States pop market. They soon made their film debut with *A Hard Day's Night* (1964). A growing desire to refine their studio efforts, coupled with the challenging nature of their concert tours, led to the band's retirement from live performances in 1966. During this time, they produced records of greater sophistication, including the albums *Rubber Soul* (1965), *Revolver* (1966), and *Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band* (1967). They also enjoyed further commercial success with *The Beatles* (also known as \"the White Album\", 1968) and *Abbey Road* (1969). The success of these records heralded the album era, as albums became the dominant form of record use over singles. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The Beatles performing on *The Ed Sullivan Show,* February 1964\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![American musician Billy Preston in 1971](image)The American soul musician Billy Preston (pictured in 1971) was, for a short time, considered a fifth Beatle during the *Get Back* sessions.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOne national paper's headlines in the following days coined the term \"Beatlemania\" to describe the riotous enthusiasm by screaming fans who greeted the band – and it stuck.[67][68] Although not billed as tour leaders, the Beatles overshadowed American acts Tommy Roe and Chris Montez during the February engagements and assumed top billing \"by audience demand\", something no British act had previously accomplished while touring with artists from the US.[69] A similar situation arose during their May–June tour with Roy Orbison.[70]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Song list\n* Filmography\n* Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band\n* The Beatles\n* 10 Admiral Grove\n* Barbara Bach\n* \"Brush with Greatness\"\n* The Concert for Bangladesh\n* Vini Poncia\n* Ring O' Records\n* *Ringo* (1978 film)\n* *Ringo's Yellow Submarine*\n* *Scouse the Mouse*\n* \"Ringo for President\"\n* Zak Starkey\n* Maureen Starkey Tigrett\n* Startling Music\n* Rory Storm\n* Tittenhurst Park\n* 4150 Starr\n |\n| * ![](image) Category\n |\n\n| Articles related to the Beatles\n |\n| --- |\n| | * v\n* t\n* e\nThe Beatles albums\n |\n| --- |\n| Albums in the core catalogue are marked in **bold**.\n |\n| Studio albums | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| UK | * ***Please Please Me***\n* ***With the Beatles***\n* ***A Hard Day's Night***\n* ***Beatles for Sale***\n* ***Help!***\n* ***Rubber Soul***\n* ***Revolver***\n* ***Sgt.

If there hadn't been Elvis, there would not have been the Beatles.\"[392] Chuck Berry was particularly influential in terms of songwriting and lyrics. Lennon noted, \"He was well advanced of his time lyric-wise. We all owe a lot to him.\"[393] Other early influences include Buddy Holly, Eddie Cochran, Roy Orbison,[394] the Everly Brothers[395] and Jerry Lee Lewis.[396]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Beatles are the best-selling music act of all time, with estimated sales of 600 million units worldwide.[4][5] They are the most successful act in the history of the US *Billboard* charts,[6] holding the record for most number-one albums on the UK Albums Chart (15), most number-one hits on the US *Billboard* Hot 100 chart (20), and most singles sold in the UK (21.9 million). The band received many accolades, including seven Grammy Awards, four Brit Awards, an Academy Award (for Best Original Song Score for the 1970 documentary film *Let It Be*), and fifteen Ivor Novello Awards. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988, and each principal member was individually inducted between 1994 and 2015. In 2004 and 2011, the group topped *Rolling Stone*'s lists of the greatest artists in history. *Time* magazine named them among the 20th century's 100 most important people.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* *The U.S. vs. John Lennon*\n\t+ soundtrack\n |\n| Other topics | * 251 Menlove Avenue\n* Kenwood\n* Tittenhurst Park\n* The Dakota\n* Bagism\n* Bed-ins for Peace\n* Imagine Piano Peace Project\n* John Lennon UFO incident\n* Lennon–McCartney\n* LennonOno Grant for Peace\n* Mark David Chapman\n* \"More popular than Jesus\"\n* Nutopia\n* Toronto Rock and Roll Revival\n\t+ *Sweet Toronto*\n* Psychedelic Rolls-Royce\n* 4147 Lennon\n |\n| * ![](image) Category\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nPaul McCartney\n |\n| --- |\n| * **Paul \"Wix\" Wickens**\n* **Rusty Anderson**\n* **Brian Ray**\n* **Abe Laboriel Jr.**\n\n\n* Linda McCartney\n* Hamish Stuart\n* Robbie McIntosh\n* Chris Whitten\n* Blair Cunningham\n |\n| Studio albums | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Non-album single | * \"Hey Jude\"\n* \"Revolution\"\n |\n| Outtakes | * \"A Beginning\"\n* \"Child of Nature\"\n* \"Circles\"\n* \"Etcetera\"\n* \"Junk\"\n* \"Not Guilty\"\n* \"Sour Milk Sea\"\n* \"What's the New Mary Jane\"\n |\n| Related articles | * The Beatles discography\n* The Beatles in India\n* Break-up of the Beatles\n* *Mother Nature's Son*\n* *The Grey Album*\n* *Live Phish Volume 13*\n |\n| * **The Beatles albums**:\n* *Please Please Me*\n* *With the Beatles*\n* *A Hard Day's Night*\n* *Beatles for Sale*\n* *Help!*\n* *Rubber Soul*\n* *Revolver*\n* *Sgt.

He eventually negotiated a one-month early release in exchange for one last recording session in Hamburg.[38] On their return to Germany in April, a distraught Kirchherr met them at the airport with news of Sutcliffe's death the previous day from a brain haemorrhage.[39] Epstein began negotiations with record labels for a recording contract. To secure a UK record contract, Epstein negotiated an early end to the band's contract with Polydor, in exchange for more recordings backing Tony Sheridan.[40] After a New Year's Day audition, Decca Records rejected the band, saying, \"Guitar groups are on the way out, Mr. Epstein.\"[41] However, three months later, producer George Martin signed the Beatles to EMI's Parlophone label.[39]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| B-sides | * \"Don't Let Me Down\"\n* \"You Know My Name (Look Up the Number)\"\n |\n| Outtakes | * \"All Things Must Pass\"\n* \"Another Day\"\n* \"The Back Seat of My Car\"\n* \"Every Night\"\n* \"Gimme Some Truth\"\n* \"Hear Me Lord\"\n* \"Let It Down\"\n* \"Madman\"\n* \"The Palace of the King of the Birds\"\n* \"Suzy Parker\"\n* \"Teddy Boy\"\n* \"Watching Rainbows\"\n |\n| Related articles | * The Beatles discography\n* Rooftop concert\n* Break-up of the Beatles\n* *Let It Be* (Laibach album)\n* *Kum Back*\n* *Let It Be* (musical)\n |\n| * **The Beatles albums**:\n* *Please Please Me*\n* *With the Beatles*\n* *A Hard Day's Night*\n* *Beatles for Sale*\n* *Help!*\n* *Rubber Soul*\n* *Revolver*\n* *Sgt.

The initials TCB stand for **Taking Care of Business**, a personal motto Presley adopted in the early 1970s. Although personnel changed over the years, the original members were James Burton (lead guitar), Jerry Scheff (bass), John Wilkinson (rhythm guitar), Larry Muhoberac (keyboards) and Ron Tutt (drums). They first appeared live at Presley’s first Las Vegas performance at what was then known as the International Hotel (later the Las Vegas Hilton, now Westgate Las Vegas Resort and Casino) on July 31, 1969.[2]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nWhen planning his return to live performing after his successful 1968 NBC television comeback, Presley had to replace original band members Scotty Moore, D.J. Fontana (who had returned to session work) and Bill Black who had formed the Bill Black Combo before his death in 1965.[3] Elvis’ first call was to guitarist James Burton, who was from Ricky Nelson's band, whom he asked to help form the group after knowing about him for many years and seeing him on television. After keyboardist Glen D. Hardin declined Burton's offer to join the group, Larry Muhoberac, who had played on several of Presley's movie soundtrack sessions, accepted his offer to perform. Burton later added Jerry Scheff on bass and John Wilkinson on rhythm guitar. Muhoberac suggested Ron Tutt for the drums to round out the section.[4] By February 1970, Glen D. Hardin joined on keyboards, eventually replacing Muhoberac who returned to studio work in Los Angeles.[5] At that time Bob Lanning, a Los Angeles session drummer joined on drums, replacing Tutt who returned later that year.[6][7] TCB brought a new lease on life to Elvis's rock 'n' roll sound of the 50s. Larrie Londin, a Nashville session drummer who recorded and occasionally toured with Presley over a nine-year period, filled in for Tutt on occasion during 1976 and 1977 performances.[8]\n\n\nIn 1975, Burton, Tutt and Muhoberac backed Johnny Cash on his album, *John R. Cash*.\n\n\n\n## Tours with other musicians: After the TCB Band disbanded[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**. Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. *(January 2022)* *(Learn how and when to remove this message)*\n |\n\n\nBefore Presley's death in 1977, several former members from the TCB Band went on to form Emmylou Harris's Hot Band and The John Denver Band. These musicians include James Burton, Glen D. Hardin, Emory Gordy Jr. and Jerry Scheff. Burton left the Hot Band in 1976 and was replaced by English guitarist Albert Lee. Scheff was never a member of the Hot Band. Gordy left John Denver's band in 1980 (he re-joined the band and toured with John shortly in 1989) and was replaced by Scheff. Burton, Hardin and Scheff remained in John Denver's band until early 1994, and was then replaced by Pete Huttlinger, Chris Nole and Alan Deremo.\n\n\nAfter drumming a few years with the Jerry Garcia Band before Presley's death, Ron Tutt was invited by Neil Diamond to become Diamond's permanent concert and recording session drummer. Tutt's drumming has since become a feature to Diamond's concert shows, punctuating moments in the Diamond concert with his TCB Band style drum fills and cymbal crashes. Tutt is a workman celebrity drummer, and routinely receives concert crowd ovations when he appears and takes his seat at his drum kit. Noteworthy during concerts is Tutt's soaring drum work on the song, \"Holly Holy\". Tutt recorded and toured with Diamond until Diamond’s retirement from touring after he was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease.\n\n\nTutt also appears on several of recordings by Nancy Sinatra.\n\n\n\n## Reunions (1979, 1981, 1987, 1997–present)[edit]\n\n\nThe TCB Band reunited with a new lineup to record their own album in 1979 of covers of Elvis Presley songs as a tribute. They also reunited in 1981 as the backing band for Tony Sheridan, augmented by Klaus Voormann and again mostly featuring Sheridan's recordings of Elvis Presley songs.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nSeveral members of the TCB band (Glen Hardin on piano, James Burton on lead guitar, Jerry Scheff on upright bass, and Ron Tutt on drums) also played with Roy Orbison in his 1987 live performance *Roy Orbison and Friends, A Black and White Night*.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nBurton, Hardin, Scheff and Tutt reunited again in 1997 to perform *Elvis: The Concert*, with John Wilkinson rejoining for the 25th anniversary concert in Memphis. Since then, Burton, Hardin, Tutt and Scheff have toured frequently together, typically backing Austrian singer Dennis Jale and his band, mostly playing music from Elvis Presley's catalogue. They have also backed Greg Page of the Wiggles for two solo albums and some live concerts.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nHowever, after the 30th anniversary concert in 2007, Scheff departed the band and was replaced on tour by Nathan East and Norbert Putnam. Wilkinson died on January 11, 2013, from cancer, at the age of 67.
