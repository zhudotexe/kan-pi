Large parts of the fortification system date from the 7th through the 4th century BC. In the 3rd century BC Shihuangdi (Qin Shi Huang), the first emperor of a united China (under the Qin dynasty), connected a number of existing defensive walls into a single system. Traditionally, the eastern terminus of the wall was considered to be Shanhai Pass (Shanhaiguan) on the coast of the Bohai (Gulf of Zhili), and the wall's length\u00a0\u2013 without its branches and other secondary sections\u00a0\u2013 was thought to extend for some 6,690\u00a0km (4,160\u00a0mi).\n6. **^** Shelach-Lavi, Gideon; Wachtel, Ido; Golan, Dan; Batzorig, Otgonjargal; Amartuvshin, Chunag; Ellenblum, Ronnie; Honeychurch, William (June 2020). \"Medieval long-wall construction on the Mongolian Steppe during the eleventh to thirteenth centuries AD\". *Antiquity*. **94** (375): 724\u2013741. doi:10.15184/aqy.2020.51.

Several walls were built from as early as the 7th century\u00a0BC,[4] with selective stretches later joined by Qin Shi Huang (220\u2013206\u00a0BC), the first emperor of China. Little of the Qin wall remains.[5] Later on, many successive dynasties built and maintained multiple stretches of border walls. The best-known sections of the wall were built by the Ming dynasty (1368\u20131644).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe frontier walls built by different dynasties have multiple courses. Collectively, they stretch from Liaodong in the east to Lop Lake in the west, from the present-day Sino\u2013Russian border in the north to Tao River (Taohe) in the south; along an arc that roughly delineates the edge of the Mongolian steppe; spanning 21,196.18\u00a0km (13,170.70\u00a0mi) in total.[7][3] Today, the defensive system of the Great Wall is generally recognized as one of the most impressive architectural feats in history.[8]\n\n\n\n\n## Names[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*Huayi tu*, an 1136 map of China with the Great Wall depicted on the northern edge of the country\nThe collection of fortifications known as the Great Wall of China has historically had a number of different names in both Chinese and English.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The Great Wall of the Han is the longest of all walls, from Mamitu, near Yumenguan, to Liaodong.\nKing Zheng of Qin conquered the last of his opponents and unified China as the First Emperor of the Qin dynasty (\"Qin Shi Huang\") in 221\u00a0BC. Intending to impose centralized rule and prevent the resurgence of feudal lords, he ordered the destruction of the sections of the walls that divided his empire among the former states. To position the empire against the Xiongnu people from the north, however, he ordered the building of new walls to connect the remaining fortifications along the empire's northern frontier. \"Build and move on\" was a central guiding principle in constructing the wall, implying that the Chinese were not erecting a permanently fixed border.[25]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n65. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Wong, Edward (June 29, 2015). \"China Fears Loss of Great Wall, Brick by Brick\". *The New York Times*.

On the other hand, the so-called Willow Palisade, following a line similar to that of the Ming Liaodong Wall, was constructed by the Qing rulers in Manchuria. Its purpose, however, was not defense but rather to prevent Han Chinese migration into Manchuria.[37]\n\n\n\n### Foreign accounts[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Part of the Great Wall of China (April 1853, X, p. 41)[38]\n![](image)The Great Wall in 1907\nNone of the Europeans who visited China or Mongolia in the 13th and 14th centuries, such as Giovanni da Pian del Carpine, William of Rubruck, Marco Polo, Odoric of Pordenone and Giovanni de' Marignolli, mentioned the Great Wall.[39][40]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nLater, the Han,[27] the Northern dynasties and the Sui all repaired, rebuilt, or expanded sections of the Great Wall at great cost to defend themselves against northern invaders.[28] The Tang and Song dynasties did not undertake any significant effort in the region.[28] Dynasties founded by non-Han ethnic groups also built their border walls: the Xianbei-ruled Northern Wei, the Khitan-ruled Liao, Jurchen-led Jin and the Tangut-established Western Xia, who ruled vast territories over Northern China throughout centuries, all constructed defensive walls but those were located much to the north of the other Great Walls as we know it, within China's autonomous region of Inner Mongolia and in modern-day Mongolia itself.[29]\n\n\n\n### Ming era[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ming Great Wall\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe current English name evolved from accounts of \"the Chinese wall\" from early modern European travelers.[20] By the nineteenth century,[20] \"the Great Wall of China\" had become standard in English and French, although other European languages such as German continue to refer to it as \"the Chinese wall\".[14]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the Great Wall of China\n\n### Early walls[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Great Wall of Qi\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWhen China opened its borders to foreign merchants and visitors after its defeat in the First and Second Opium Wars, the Great Wall became a main attraction for tourists.

Built to withstand the attack of small arms such as swords and spears, these walls were made mostly of stone or by stamping earth and gravel between board frames.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Outer Wall (W to E) | * Jiayu Pass\n* Jumenbu\n* Badaling\n* Huanghuacheng\n* Jiankou (Beijing Knot)\n* Mutianyu\n* Baimaguan\n* Gubeikou\n* Jinshanling\n* Simatai\n* Huangya Pass\n* Shanhai Pass\n* Hushan\n |\n| Inner Wall (W to E) | * Guangwu (New Guangwu)\n* Yanmen Pass\n* Pingxing Pass\n* Juyong Pass\n |\n| Other | * Niangzi Pass (Hebei/Shanxi border spur)\n* Miaojiang Great Wall (\"Southern Great Wall\")\n |\n| Nine Garrisons | * Liaodong\n* Ji\n* Xuanfu\n* Datong\n* Taiyuan\n* Yansui\n* Ningxia\n* Guyuan\n* Gansu\n |\n\n |\n| Other time periods | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Warring States (475\u2013221 BC) | * Great Wall of Qi\n |\n| Western Han dynasty (202 BC\u20139 AD) | * Yumen Pass\n* Yang Pass\n |\n| Yuan dynasty (1206-1368) | * Cloud Platform\n |\n| Qing dynasty (1644-1912) | * Dajingmen\n |\n\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nNew 7 Wonders of the World\n |\n| --- |\n| * Great Wall of China\n* Petra\n* Colosseum\n* Chichen Itza\n* Machu Picchu\n* Taj Mahal\n* *Christ the Redeemer*\n |\n| Honorary status: Great Pyramid of Giza\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 2012, based on existing research and the results of a comprehensive mapping survey, the National Cultural Heritage Administration of China concluded that the remaining Great Wall associated sites include 10,051 wall sections, 1,764 ramparts or trenches, 29,510 individual buildings, and 2,211 fortifications or passes, with the walls and trenches spanning a total length of 21,196.18\u00a0km (13,170.70\u00a0mi).[3] Incorporating advanced technologies, the study has concluded that the Ming Great Wall measures 8,850\u00a0km (5,500\u00a0mi).[52] This consists of 6,259\u00a0km (3,889\u00a0mi) of wall sections, 359\u00a0km (223\u00a0mi) of trenches and 2,232\u00a0km (1,387\u00a0mi) of natural defensive barriers such as hills and rivers.[52] In addition, Qin, Han and earlier Great Wall sites are 3,080\u00a0km (1,914\u00a0mi) long in total; Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234) border fortifications are 4,010\u00a0km (2,492\u00a0mi) in length; the remainder date back to Northern Wei, Northern Qi, Sui, Tang, the Five Dynasties, Song, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nTransporting the large quantity of materials required for construction was difficult, so builders always tried to use local resources. Stones from the mountains were used over mountain ranges, while rammed earth was used for construction in the plains. There are no surviving historical records indicating the exact length and course of the Qin walls. Most of the ancient walls have eroded away over the centuries, and very few sections remain today. The human cost of the construction is unknown, but it has been estimated by some authors that hundreds of thousands[26] of workers died building the Qin wall. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe North African traveler Ibn Battuta, who also visited China during the Yuan dynasty c.\u20091346, had heard about China's Great Wall, possibly before he had arrived in China.[41] He wrote that the wall is \"sixty days' travel\" from Zeitun (modern Quanzhou) in his travelogue *Gift to Those Who Contemplate the Wonders of Cities and the Marvels of Travelling*. He associated it with the legend of the wall mentioned in the Qur'an,[42] which Dhul-Qarnayn (commonly associated with Alexander the Great) was said to have erected to protect people near the land of the rising sun from the savages of Gog and Magog. However, Ibn Battuta could find no one who had either seen it or knew of anyone who had seen it, suggesting that although there were remnants of the wall at that time, they were not significant.[43]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n27. **^** Coonan, Clifford (February 27, 2012). \"British researcher discovers piece of Great Wall 'marooned outside China'\". *The Irish Times*.

In some places, the height of the wall has been reduced from more than 5\u00a0m (16\u00a0ft 5\u00a0in) to less than 2\u00a0m (6\u00a0ft 7\u00a0in). Various square lookout towers that characterize the most famous images of the wall have disappeared. Many western sections of the wall are constructed from mud, rather than brick and stone, and thus are more susceptible to erosion.[67] In 2014 a portion of the wall near the border of Liaoning and Hebei province was repaired with concrete. The work has been much criticized.[68]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)A more rural portion of the Great Wall that stretches through the mountains, here seen in slight disrepair\nWhile portions north of Beijing and near tourist centers have been preserved and even extensively renovated, in many other locations the wall is in disrepair. The wall sometimes provided a source of stones to build houses and roads.[64] Sections of the wall are also prone to graffiti and vandalism, while inscribed bricks were pilfered and sold on the market for up to 50 renminbi.[65] Parts have been destroyed to make way for construction or mining.[66]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBefore the use of bricks, the Great Wall was mainly built from rammed earth, stones, and wood. During the Ming, however, bricks were heavily used in many areas of the wall, as were materials such as tiles, lime, and stone. The size and weight of the bricks made them easier to work with than earth and stone, so construction quickened. Additionally, bricks could bear more weight and endure better than rammed earth. Stone can hold under its own weight better than brick, but is more difficult to use. Consequently, stones cut into rectangular shapes were used for the foundation, inner and outer brims, and gateways of the wall. Battlements line the uppermost portion of the vast majority of the wall, with defensive gaps a little over 30\u00a0cm (12\u00a0in) tall, and about 23\u00a0cm (9.1\u00a0in) wide. From the parapets, guards could survey the surrounding land.[59]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe sections of the Great Wall around Beijing municipality are especially famous: they were frequently renovated and are regularly visited by tourists today. The Badaling Great Wall near Zhangjiakou is the most famous stretch of the wall, for this was the first section to be opened to the public in the People's Republic of China, as well as the showpiece stretch for foreign dignitaries.[53] The Badaling Great Wall saw nearly 10 million visitors in 2018, and in 2019, a daily limit of 65,000 visitors was instated.[54] South of Badaling is the Juyong Pass; when it was used by the Chinese to protect their land, this section of the wall had many guards to defend the capital Beijing. Made of stone and bricks from the hills, this portion of the Great Wall is 7.8\u00a0m (25\u00a0ft 7\u00a0in) high and 5\u00a0m (16\u00a0ft 5\u00a0in) wide.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn October 2003, Chinese astronaut Yang Liwei stated that he had not been able to see the Great Wall of China. In response, the European Space Agency (ESA) issued a press release reporting that from an orbit between 160 and 320\u00a0km (100 and 200\u00a0mi), the Great Wall is visible to the naked eye.[73] The image was actually a river in Beijing.[78]\n\n\nLeroy Chiao, a Chinese-American astronaut, took a photograph from the International Space Station that shows the wall. It was so indistinct that the photographer was not certain he had actually captured it. Based on the photograph, the *China Daily* later reported that the Great Wall can be seen from 'space' with the naked eye, under favorable viewing conditions, if one knows exactly where to look.[79][73]\n\n\n\n## Gallery[edit]\n\n\n* ![The Great Wall at Badaling](image)\n\nThe Great Wall at Badaling\n* ![The Great Wall at dawn](image)\n\nThe Great Wall at dawn\n* ![The Juyongguan area of the Great Wall accepts numerous tourists each day.](image)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nApart from defense, other purposes of the Great Wall have included border controls, allowing the imposition of duties on goods transported along the Silk Road, regulation or encouragement of trade and the control of immigration and emigration.[6] Furthermore, the defensive characteristics of the Great Wall were enhanced by the construction of watchtowers, troop barracks, garrison stations, signaling capabilities through the means of smoke or fire, and the fact that the path of the Great Wall also served as a transportation corridor.\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Famous for its rock-cut architecture and water conduit system, Petra is also called the \"Rose City\" because of the colour of the stone from which it is carved;[5] it was famously called \"a rose-red city half as old as time\" in a poem of 1845 by John Burgon. It is adjacent to the mountain of Jabal Al-Madbah, in a basin surrounded by mountains forming the eastern flank of the Arabah valley running from the Dead Sea to the Gulf of Aqaba.[6] Access to the city is through a famously picturesque 1.2-kilometre-long (3\u20444\u00a0mi) gorge called the Siq, which leads directly to the Khazneh.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* University of Arkansas Petra Project.

Instead, archaeological, religious and linguistic evidence confirm that they are a northern Arabian tribe.[22] Current evidence suggests that the Nabataean name for Petra was Raq\u0113m\u014d, variously spelled in inscriptions as *rqmw* or *rqm*.[4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)the \"Street of Facades\"\nBecause the structures weakened with age, many of the tombs became vulnerable to thieves, and many treasures were stolen. In 1929, a four-person team consisting of British archaeologists Agnes Conway and George Horsfield, Palestinian physician and folklore expert Tawfiq Canaan and Ditlef Nielsen, a Danish scholar, excavated and surveyed Petra.[39]\n\n\nThe archaeologist Philip Hammond from the University of Utah visited Petra for nearly 40 years. He explained that the local folklore says it was created by the wand of Moses, when he struck the rock to bring forth water for the Israelites. Hammond believed the carved channels deep within the walls and ground were made from ceramic pipes that once fed water for the city, from rock-cut systems on the canyon rim.[40]\n\n\nNumerous scrolls in Greek and dating to the Byzantine period were discovered in an excavated church near the Temple of the Winged Lions in Petra in December 1993.[41]\n\n\n\n### 21st century[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n55. **^** \"Petra\". *www.memphistours.com*.

Unlike their enemies, the Nabataeans were accustomed to living in the barren deserts and were able to repel attacks by taking advantage of the area's mountainous terrain. They were particularly skillful in harvesting rainwater, agriculture, and stone carving. Petra flourished in the 1st century AD, when its Al-Khazneh structure, possibly the mausoleum of Nabataean king Aretas IV, was constructed, and its population peaked at an estimated 20,000 inhabitants.[11] Most of the famous rock-cut buildings, which are mainly tombs, date from this and the following period. Much less remains of the free-standing buildings of the city.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Petra Siq in 1947 (left) compared with the same location in 2013\nThe first European to describe them was the Swiss traveler Johann Ludwig Burckhardt during his travels in 1812.[6][36] At that time, the Greek Church of Jerusalem operated a diocese in Al Karak named Battra (\u0628\u0627\u0637\u0631\u0647 in Arabic, and \u03a0\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03c2 in Greek) and it was the opinion among the clergy of Jerusalem that Kerak was the ancient city of Petra.[36]\n\n\nBurckhardt already spoke Arabic fluently, and was on his way to explore the Niger River when he heard stories of a dead city that held the tomb of the Prophet Aaron, and became fascinated with finding the city. He then dressed himself up as a local, and only spoke in Arabic, bringing a goat with him with the intent of sacrificing it in honor of Aaron's Tomb. After one day of exploring, he was convinced that he had found the lost city of Petra.[37]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn December 2022, Petra was hit by heavy flooding.[42]\n\n\n\n## Layout[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The narrow passage (Siq) that leads to Petra\nExcavations have demonstrated that it was the ability of the Nabataeans to control the water supply that led to the rise of the desert city, creating an artificial oasis. The area is visited by flash floods, but archaeological evidence shows that the Nabataeans controlled these floods by the use of dams, cisterns, and water conduits. These innovations stored water for prolonged periods of drought and enabled the city to prosper from its sale.[43][44]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n6. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** ![](image)\u00a0One or more of the preceding sentences\u00a0incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain:\u00a0Cooke, George Albert (1911). \"Petra\".

Petra fell to the Romans, who annexed Nabataea and renamed it as Arabia Petraea.[12] Petra's importance declined as sea trade routes emerged, and after an earthquake in 363 destroyed many structures. In the Byzantine era, several Christian churches were built, but the city continued to decline and, by the early Islamic era, it was abandoned except for a handful of nomads. It remained unknown to the western world until 1812, when Swiss traveller Johann Ludwig Burckhardt rediscovered it.[13]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBetween 111 and 114 Trajan built the Via Traiana Nova, running from the Syrian border to the Red Sea through Petra. This road followed the old routes of Nabataean caravans. In the shadow of the *Pax Romana*, this route revived trade between Arabia, Syria, and Mediterranean harbors. In 125 AD, one of Emperor Hadrian's administrators left marks[*dubious \u2013 discuss*] in Petra, pointed out by documents found at the Dead Sea. In 130 AD, Hadrian visited the former Nabataean capital, giving it the name of *Hadri\u0101n\u012b Petra Metropolis*, imprinted on his coins. His visit, however, did not lead to any boom in development and new buildings as it did in Jerash. The province's governor, Sextius Florentinus, erected a monumental mausoleum for his son near the end of the al-Hubta (King's Wall) tombs, which had been generally reserved during the Nabataean period for the royal family.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n49. **^** Bachmann, W., Watzinger, C.

Ever since Johann Ludwig Burckhardt[79] aka Sheikh Ibrahim had re-discovered the ruin city in Petra, Jordan, in 1812, the cultural heritage site has attracted different people who shared an interest in the ancient history and culture of the Nabataeans such as travellers, pilgrims, painters and savants.[80] However, it was not until the late 19th century that the ruins were systematically approached by archaeological researchers.[81] Since then regular archaeological excavations[82] and ongoing research on the Nabataean culture have been part of today's UNESCO world cultural heritage site Petra.[83] Through the excavations in the Petra Archaeological Park an increasing number of Nabataean cultural heritage is being exposed to environmental impact. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRecently, Petra has been put forward as the original direction of Muslim prayer, the Qibla, by some in the revisionist school of Islamic studies, namely that the earliest mosques faced Petra, not Jerusalem or Mecca.[62] However, others have challenged the notion of comparing modern readings of Qiblah directions to early mosques\u2019 Qiblahs as they claim early Muslims could not accurately calculate the direction of the Qiblah to Mecca and so the apparent pinpointing of Petra by some early mosques may well be coincidental.[63]\n\n\n\n![](image)Ad Deir (\"The Monastery\")\nThe Monastery, Petra's largest monument, dates from the 1st century BC.

This information is inscribed on the ruins of the Monastery (the name is the translation of the Arabic Ad Deir).[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Climate data for Petra\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Mean daily maximum \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 11.0(51.8)\n | 13.1(55.6)\n | 16.6(61.9)\n | 20.9(69.6)\n | 25.1(77.2)\n | 28.6(83.5)\n | 29.8(85.6)\n | 30.0(86.0)\n | 28.1(82.6)\n | 24.6(76.3)\n | 18.2(64.8)\n | 13.4(56.1)\n | 21.6(70.9)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 2.2(36.0)\n | 2.8(37.0)\n | 5.6(42.1)\n | 8.7(47.7)\n | 11.7(53.1)\n | 14.1(57.4)\n | 16.1(61.0)\n | 16.5(61.7)\n | 14.2(57.6)\n | 11.2(52.2)\n | 7.1(44.8)\n | 3.4(38.1)\n | 9.5(49.1)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 45(1.8)\n | 38(1.5)\n | 36(1.4)\n | 12(0.5)\n | 4(0.2)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 2(0.1)\n | 15(0.6)\n | 41(1.6)\n | 193(7.6)\n |\n| Source: Climate-Data.org, Climate data\n |\n\n## Conservation[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of World Heritage Sites in Jordan\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n35. **^** Lawler, Andrew. \"Reconstructing Petra\". *Smithsonian*.

Another approach was possibly from the high plateau to the north. Today, most modern visitors approach the site from the east. The impressive eastern entrance leads steeply down through a dark, narrow gorge, in places only 3\u20134\u00a0m (10\u201313\u00a0ft) wide, called the Siq (\"shaft\"), a natural geological feature formed from a deep split in the sandstone rocks and serving as a waterway flowing into Wadi Musa.[45]\n\n\n\n### Hellenistic architecture[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Bedal, Leigh-Ann (2004). *The Petra Pool-Complex: A Hellenistic Paradeisos in the Nabataean Capital*.

In 363, an earthquake destroyed many buildings and crippled the vital water management system.[31] The old city of Petra was the capital of the Byzantine province of Palaestina III and many churches from the Byzantine period were excavated in and around Petra. In one of them, the Byzantine Church, 140 papyri were discovered, which contained mainly contracts dated from 530s to 590s, establishing that the city was still flourishing in the 6th century.[32] The Byzantine Church is a prime example of monumental architecture in Byzantine Petra.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Paradise, T.

He gives an anecdote about its bishop, Athenogenes. It ceased to be a metropolitan bishopric sometime before 687 when that function had been transferred to Areopolis. Petra is not mentioned in the narratives of the Muslim conquest of the Levant, nor does it appear in any early Islamic records.[33]\n\n\n\n### Crusaders and Mamluks[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Alwaeira Castle\nIn the 12th century, the Crusaders built fortresses such as the Alwaeira Castle, but were forced to abandon Petra after a while. As a result, the location of Petra was lost until the 19th century.[34][35]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIt remained in the hands of the Franks until 1189.[6] It is still a titular see of the Catholic Church.[64]\n\n\nAccording to Arab tradition, Petra is the spot where Musa (Moses) struck a rock with his staff and water came forth, and where Moses' brother, Harun (Aaron), is buried, at Mount Hor, known today as Jabal Haroun or Mount Aaron. The Wadi Musa or \"Wadi of Moses\" is the Arab name for the narrow valley at the head of which Petra is sited. A mountaintop shrine of Moses' sister Miriam was still shown to pilgrims at the time of Jerome in the 4th century, but its location has not been identified since.[65]\n\n\n\n## Climate[edit]\n\n\nIn Petra, there is a semi-arid climate. Most rain falls in the winter. The K\u00f6ppen-Geiger climate classification is BSk. The average annual temperature in Petra is 15.5\u00a0\u00b0C (59.9\u00a0\u00b0F). About 193\u00a0mm (7.60\u00a0in) of precipitation falls annually.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe interest that Roman emperors showed in the city in the 3rd century suggests that Petra and its environs remained highly esteemed for a long time. An inscription to Liber Pater, a god revered by Emperor Septimius Severus, was found in the *temenos* of the temple known as Qasr al-Bint, and Nabataean tombs contained silver coins with the emperor's portrait, as well as pottery from his reign. Emperor Elagabalus declared Petra to be a Roman colony, when he reorganized the Roman Empire towards the end of the 3rd century.[30] The area from Petra to Wadi Mujib, the Negev, and the Sinai Peninsula were annexed into the province of Palaestina Salutaris. Petra may be seen on the Madaba mosaic map from the reign of Emperor Justinian.\n\n\n\n### Byzantine period[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Burger, professor of anthropology at Yale University) to have been built in the 1450s.[22] However, a 2021 study led by Burger used radiocarbon dating (specifically, AMS) to reveal that Machu Picchu may have been occupied from around 1420 to 1530 AD.[23][24] Construction appears to date from two great Inca rulers, Pachacutec Inca Yupanqui (1438\u20131471) and T\u00fapac Inca Yupanqui (1472\u20131493).[25][26]:\u200axxxvi\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Incas built the estate around 1450 but abandoned it a century later, at the time of the Spanish conquest. According to the new AMS radiocarbon dating, it was occupied from c. 1420\u20131532.[13] Historical research published in 2022 claims that the site was probably called Huayna Picchu by the Inca people themselves, as it exists on the smaller peak of the same name.[14][15]\n\n\nMachu Picchu was declared a Peruvian Historic Sanctuary in 1982 and a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983.[3] In 2007, Machu Picchu was voted one of the New Seven Wonders of the World in a worldwide internet poll.[16]\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nIn the Quechua language, *machu* means \"old\" or \"old person\", while *picchu* means \"pyramid; pointed, multi-sided solid; cone,\" though it may also refer to a \"portion of coca that is chewed.\"[17] Thus the name of the site is sometimes interpreted as \"old mountain\".[18] The site is on a narrow saddle between two mountain peaks: Machu Picchu and Huayna Picchu.[19]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Inca civilization had no written language and, after the discovery by a Spanish soldier Baltasar Ocampo, by the end of the 16th-century no more Europeans visited the site until the 19th century, so far as is known, so there are no written records of the site while it was in use. The names of the buildings, their supposed uses, and their inhabitants are the product of modern archaeologists based on physical evidence, including tombs at the site. Machu Picchu was built in the classical Inca style, with polished dry-stone walls. Its three primary structures are the *Intihuatana*, the *Temple of the Sun*, and the *Temple of the Three Windows*. Most of the outlying buildings have been reconstructed in order to give visitors a better idea of how they originally appeared.[11] By 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu had been restored[11] and restoration continues.[12] Most recent archaeologists believe that Machu Picchu was constructed as an estate for the Inca emperor Pachacuti (1438\u20131472). \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the late 16th century, Spaniards who had recently gained control of the area documented that indigenous individuals mentioned returning to \"Huayna Picchu\", the name that is believed to be originally given to the site by locals.[14] The Spanish conquistador Baltasar de Ocampo had notes of a visit during the end of the 16th century to a mountain fortress called *Pitcos* with sumptuous and majestic buildings, erected with great skill and art, all the lintels of the doors, as well the principal as the ordinary ones, being of marble and elaborately carved.[40]\n\n\nOver the centuries, the surrounding jungle overgrew the site, and few outside the immediate area knew of its existence. The site may have been re-discovered and plundered in 1867 by a German businessman, Augusto Berns.[41] Some evidence indicates that the German engineer J. M. von Hassel arrived earlier. Maps show references to Machu Picchu as early as 1874.[42] A 1904 atlas designated the site as Huayna Picchu.[14]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n13. **^** Burger, R. L.; Salazar, L.

The expedition undertook a four-month clearing of the site with local labor, which was expedited with the support of the Prefect of Cusco. Excavation started in 1912 with further excavation undertaken in 1914 and 1915. Bingham focused on Machu Picchu because of its fine Inca stonework and well-preserved nature, which had lain undisturbed since the site was abandoned. None of Bingham's several hypotheses explaining the site held up. During his studies, he carried various artifacts back to Yale. One prominent artifact was a set of 15th-century, ceremonial Incan knives made from bismuth bronze; they are the earliest known artifact containing this alloy.[50][51]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n18. **^** Luciano, Pellegrino A.

Although Machu Picchu is considered to be a \"royal\" estate, it would not have been passed down in the line of succession. Rather it was used for 80 years before being abandoned, seemingly because of the Spanish conquests in other parts of the Inca Empire.[22] It is possible that most of its inhabitants died from smallpox introduced by travelers before the Spanish conquistadors arrived in the area.[27]\n\n\n\n### Ancient life[edit]\n\n\n#### Daily life in Machu Picchu[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Jarus, Owen (31 August 2012). \"Machu Picchu: Facts & History - Abandonment of Machu Picchu\". *Live Science*.

Since its rediscovery in 1911, growing numbers of tourists have visited the site each year, with numbers exceeding 1.4 million in 2017.[65] As Peru's most visited tourist attraction, and a major revenue generator, it is continually exposed to economic and commercial forces. In the late 1990s, the Peruvian government granted concessions to allow the construction of a cable car and a luxury hotel, including a tourist complex with boutiques and restaurants and a bridge to the site.[66] Many people protested the plans, including Peruvians and foreign scientists, saying that more visitors would pose a physical burden on the ruins.[67] In 2018, plans were restarted to again construct a cable car to encourage Peruvians to visit Machu Picchu and boost domestic tourism.[68] A no-fly zone exists above the area.[69] UNESCO is considering putting Machu Picchu on its List of World Heritage in Danger.[66]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n104. **^** Tripcevich, Nicholas; Vaughn, Kevin J.

It is located in the Machupicchu District within Urubamba Province[4] above the Sacred Valley, which is 80 kilometers (50\u00a0mi) northwest of Cusco. The Urubamba River flows past it, cutting through the Cordillera and creating a canyon with a tropical mountain climate.[5] In reference to the site's name, for most English or Spanish speakers, the first 'c' in *Picchu* is silent. In English, the name is pronounced /\u02ccm\u0251\u02d0t\u0283u\u02d0 \u02c8pi\u02d0t\u0283u\u02d0/ *MAH-choo PEE-choo*[6][7] or /\u02ccm\u00e6t\u0283u\u02d0 \u02c8pi\u02d0kt\u0283u\u02d0/ *MATCH-oo PEAK-choo*,[7][8] in Spanish as [\u02c8mat\u0283u \u02c8pit\u0283u] or [\u02c8mat\u0283u \u02c8pi\u0263t\u0283u],[9] and in Quechua (*Machu Pikchu*)[10] as [\u02c8mat\u0283\u028a \u02c8p\u026akt\u0283\u028a].\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring the 2022\u20132023 Peruvian protests against Dina Boluarte and the Congress of Peru, protesters blocked various routes to Machu Picchu, trapping thousands of tourists at the mountain citadel in December 2022, resulting with the government having to airlift stranded visitors.[78][79] Due to the complications surrounding visitors and the protests, the Ministry of Culture closed Machu Picchu from the public indefinitely on 22 January 2023.[78][80] It reopened the next month, on 15 February 2023.[81]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMachu Picchu is situated above a bow of the Urubamba River, which surrounds the site on three sides, where cliffs drop vertically for 450 meters (1,480\u00a0ft) to the river at their base. The area is subject to morning mists rising from the river.[47] The location of the city was a military secret, and its deep precipices and steep mountains provided natural defenses. The Inca Bridge, an Inca grass rope bridge, across the Urubamba River in the Pongo de Mainique, provided a secret entrance for the Inca army. Another Inca bridge was built to the west of Machu Picchu, the tree-trunk bridge, at a location where a gap occurs in the cliff that measures 6 meters (20\u00a0ft).\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n41. **^** Dan Collyns (6 June 2008). \"Machu Picchu ruin 'found earlier'\". *BBC News*.;Michael Marshall (7 June 2008). \"Incan lost city looted by German businessman\". *New Scientist*.\n42. **^** Romero, Simon (7 December 2008). \"Debate Rages in Peru:t?\". *The New York Times*.\n43. **^** Heaney, Christopher (2011). *Cradle of gold: the story of Hiram Bingham, a real-life Indiana Jones and the search for Machu Picchu*.

Its entrances, walls, steps, and windows are some of the finest masonry in the Incan Empire. The cave also includes a tunnel-like window unique among Incan structures, which was constructed to allow sunlight into the cave only during several days around the December solstice. For this reason, the cave was inaccessible for much of the year.[97] Inti Mach'ay is located on the eastern side of Machu Picchu, just north of the \"Condor Stone.\" Many of the caves surrounding this area were prehistorically used as tombs, yet there is no evidence that Mach'ay was a burial ground.[98]\n\n\n\n#### Dispute over cultural artifacts[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n78. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Peru protests: Machu Picchu closed indefinitely and tourists stranded\". *BBC News*. 21 January 2023.

Huayna means \"young\" in the Quechua language. The research documents that, starting in 1911 with the publications of American historian and explorer Hiram Bingham, the name Machu Picchu became associated with the ruins.[14][20] Evidence of references by native Quechua speakers dating to their reports to the Aziz's island, early maps, and even discussions with Bingham, is cited in the new research into historical records regarding an apparently arbitrary selection of the name Bingham associated with the site\u2014that differed from the traditional name.[21] The name given to the abandoned settlement by its builders has not been determined by researchers.\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAccording to Bingham, \"one old prospector said there were interesting ruins at Machu Picchu,\" though his statements \"were given no importance by the leading citizens.\" Only later did Bingham learn that Charles Wiener also heard of the ruins at Huayna Picchu and Machu Picchu, but was unable to reach them.[26][*non-primary source needed*]\n\n\n\n![](image)Hiram Bingham III at his tent door near Machu Picchu in 1912\nArmed with this information the expedition went down the Urubamba River. En route, Bingham asked local people to show them Inca ruins, especially any place described as having a white rock over a spring.[26]:\u200a137[*non-primary source needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFrom 1994 to 2019, the Chief of the National Archaeological Park of Machu Picchu was Fernando Astete, a Peruvian anthropologist and archaeologist, who worked for more than thirty years on the preservation, conservation and research of the site.[77] As a result of his research as director of the Park, the construction processes and functions of the sanctuary were acknowledged by the scientific community and a better understanding of the Inca landscape was given to the general public, who increasingly started to implement more sustainable tourism in the area, as a sign of respect for the site.[77]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMachu Picchu lies in the Southern Hemisphere, 13.111 degrees south of the equator.[82] It is 80 kilometers (50 miles) northwest of Cusco, on the crest of the mountain Machu Picchu, located about 2,430 meters (7,970 feet) above mean sea level, over 1,000 meters (3,300\u00a0ft) lower than Cusco, which has an elevation of 3,400 meters (11,200\u00a0ft).[82] As such, it had a milder climate than the Inca capital. It is one of the most important archaeological sites in South America, one of the most visited tourist attractions in Latin America and the most visited in Peru.[83]\n\n\nMachu Picchu features wet humid summers and dry frosty winters, with the majority of the annual rain falling from March through to October.[82]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Terraces used for farming at Machu Picchu\nMuch of the farming done at Machu Picchu was done on its hundreds of man-made terraces. These terraces were a work of considerable engineering, built to ensure good drainage and soil fertility while also protecting the mountain itself from erosion and landslides. However, the terraces were not perfect, as studies of the land show that there were landslides that happened during the construction of Machu Picchu. Still visible are places where the terraces were shifted by landslides and then stabilized by the Inca as they continued to build around the area.[33] Terraces constructed overlooking the Urubamba River and many other springs provided fresh water for crop production and served more than 1,000 households.[34]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe section of the mountain where Machu Picchu was built provided various challenges that the Incas solved with local materials. One issue was the seismic activity due to two fault lines. It made mortar and similar building methods nearly useless. Instead, the Inca mined stones from the quarry at the site,[104] lined them up and shaped them to fit together perfectly, stabilizing the structures. Inca walls have many stabilizing features: doors and windows are trapezoidal, narrowing from bottom to top; corners usually are rounded; inside corners often incline slightly into the rooms, and outside corners were often tied together by \"L\"-shaped blocks; walls are offset slightly from row to row rather than rising straight from bottom to top.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

The archeological site is located in Tin\u00fam Municipality, Yucat\u00e1n State, Mexico.[1]\n\n\nChich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 was a major focal point in the Northern Maya Lowlands from the Late Classic (c. AD 600\u2013900) through the Terminal Classic (c. AD 800\u2013900) and into the early portion of the Postclassic period (c. AD 900\u20131200). The site exhibits a multitude of architectural styles, reminiscent of styles seen in central Mexico and of the Puuc and Chenes styles of the Northern Maya lowlands. The presence of central Mexican styles was once thought to have been representative of direct migration or even conquest from central Mexico, but most contemporary interpretations view the presence of these non-Maya styles more as the result of cultural diffusion.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1944, Barbachano Peon purchased all of the Hacienda Chich\u00e9n, including Chichen Itza, from the heirs of Edward Thompson.[37] Around that same time the Carnegie Institution completed its work at Chichen Itza and abandoned the Hacienda Chich\u00e9n, which Barbachano turned into another seasonal hotel.\n\n\nIn 1972, Mexico enacted the Ley Federal Sobre Monumentos y Zonas Arqueol\u00f3gicas, Art\u00edsticas e Hist\u00f3ricas (Federal Law over Monuments and Archeological, Artistic and Historic Sites) that put all the nation's pre-Columbian monuments, including those at Chichen Itza, under federal ownership.[73] There were now hundreds, if not thousands, of visitors every year to Chichen Itza, and more were expected with the development of the Canc\u00fan resort area to the east.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Chichen Itza, Carnegie Project staff, 1924: left to right, J.O.

They urged Governor Felipe Carrillo Puerto to build roads to the more famous monuments, including Chichen Itza. In 1923, Governor Carrillo Puerto officially opened the highway to Chichen Itza.

Augustus Le Plongeon called it \"Chaacmol\" (later renamed \"Chac Mool\", which has been the term to describe all types of this statuary found in Mesoamerica). Teobert Maler and Alfred Maudslay explored Chich\u00e9n in the 1880s and both spent several weeks at the site and took extensive photographs.

At first he encountered no resistance, and set about dividing the lands around the city and awarding them to his soldiers. The Maya became more hostile over time, and eventually they laid siege to the Spanish, cutting off their supply line to the coast, and forcing them to barricade themselves among the ruins of the ancient city. Months passed, but no reinforcements arrived. Montejo the Younger attempted an all-out assault against the Maya and lost 150 of his remaining troops. He was forced to abandon Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 in 1534 under cover of darkness. By 1535, all Spanish had been driven from the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula.[29]\n\n\nMontejo eventually returned to Yucat\u00e1n and, by recruiting Maya from Campeche and Champoton, built a large Indio-Spanish army and conquered the peninsula.[30] The Spanish crown later issued a land grant that included Chichen Itza and by 1588 it was a working cattle ranch.[31]\n\n\n\n### Modern history[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAccording to some colonial Mayan sources (e.g., the Book of Chilam Balam of Chumayel), Hunac Ceel, ruler of Mayapan, conquered Chichen Itza in the 13th century. Hunac Ceel supposedly prophesied his own rise to power. According to custom at the time, individuals thrown into the Cenote Sagrado were believed to have the power of prophecy if they survived. During one such ceremony, the chronicles state, there were no survivors, so Hunac Ceel leaped into the Cenote Sagrado, and when removed, prophesied his own ascension.\n\n\nWhile there is some archeological evidence that indicates Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 was at one time looted and sacked,[24] there appears to be greater evidence that it could not have been by Mayapan, at least not when Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 was an active urban center. Archeological data now indicates that Chichen Itza declined as a regional center by 1100, before the rise of Mayapan. Ongoing research at the site of Mayapan may help resolve this chronological conundrum.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThis section of the site has been closed to tourism for years while archaeological excavations and restorations were ongoing, and is planned to reopen to visitors in 2024.[67]\n\n\n\n#### Other structures[edit]\n\n\nChichen Itza also has a variety of other structures densely packed in the ceremonial center of about 5 square kilometers (1.9\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) and several outlying subsidiary sites.\n\n\n\n#### Caves of Balankanche[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)1938 painting of one of the reliefs found on lower terrace columns of the Temple of the Warriors, by Octavio Medellin\nChichen Itza is one of the most visited archeological sites in Mexico; in 2017 it was estimated to have received 2.1 million visitors.[70]\n\n\nTourism has been a factor at Chichen Itza for more than a century. John Lloyd Stephens, who popularized the Maya Yucat\u00e1n in the public's imagination with his book *Incidents of Travel in Yucatan*, inspired many to make a pilgrimage to Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1. Even before the book was published, Benjamin Norman and Baron Emanuel von Friedrichsthal traveled to Chichen after meeting Stephens, and both published the results of what they found. Friedrichsthal was the first to photograph Chichen Itza, using the recently invented daguerreotype.[71]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Chavez, Rene; et\u00a0al.

The three best known of these complexes are the Great North Platform, which includes the monuments of the Temple of Kukulc\u00e1n (El Castillo), Temple of Warriors and the Great Ball Court; The Osario Group, which includes the pyramid of the same name as well as the Temple of Xtoloc; and the Central Group, which includes the Caracol, Las Monjas, and Akab Dzib.\n\n\nSouth of Las Monjas, in an area known as Chich\u00e9n Viejo (Old Chich\u00e9n) and only open to archeologists, are several other complexes, such as the Group of the Initial Series, Group of the Lintels, and Group of the Old Castle.\n\n\n\n### Architectural styles[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Chichanchob\nThe **Casa Colorada** (Spanish for \"Red House\") is one of the best preserved buildings at Chichen Itza. Significant red paint was still present in the days of the 19th century explorers. Its Maya name is *Chichanchob*, which according to INAH may mean \"small holes\". In one chamber there are extensive carved hieroglyphs that mention rulers of Chichen Itza and possibly of the nearby city of Ek Balam, and contain a Maya date inscribed which correlates to 869 AD, one of the oldest such dates found in all of Chichen Itza.\n\n\nIn 2009, INAH restored a small ball court that adjoined the back wall of the Casa Colorada.[61]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* *Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica*: Article on Chichen Itza\n* Chichen Itza Digital Media Archive (creative commons-licensed photos, laser scans, panoramas), with particularly detailed information on El Caracol and el Castillo, using data from a National Science Foundation/CyArk research partnership\n* UNESCO page about Chichen Itza World Heritage site\n* Ancient Observatories page on Chichen Itza\n* Chichen Itza reconstructed in 3D\n* Archaeological documentation for Chichen Itza created by non-profit group INSIGHT and funded by the National Science Foundation and Chabot Space and Science Center\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the 1980s, Chichen Itza began to receive an influx of visitors on the day of the spring equinox. Today several thousand show up to see the light-and-shadow effect on the Temple of Kukulc\u00e1n during which the feathered serpent appears to crawl down the side of the pyramid.[nb 6] Tour guides will also demonstrate a unique the acoustical effect at Chichen Itza: a handclap before the staircase of the El Castillo pyramid will produce by an echo that resembles the chirp of a bird, similar to that of the quetzal as investigated by Declercq.[74]\n\n\nChichen Itza, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is the second-most visited of Mexico's archeological sites.[75] The archeological site draws many visitors from the popular tourist resort of Canc\u00fan, who make a day trip on tour buses.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The Kukulc\u00e1n Temple, photograph by Teobert Maler, 1892\nIn 1894 the United States Consul to Yucat\u00e1n, Edward Herbert Thompson, purchased the Hacienda Chich\u00e9n, which included the ruins of Chichen Itza. For 30 years, Thompson explored the ancient city. His discoveries included the earliest dated carving upon a lintel in the Temple of the Initial Series and the excavation of several graves in the Osario (High Priest's Temple). Thompson is most famous for dredging the Cenote Sagrado (Sacred Cenote) from 1904 to 1910, where he recovered artifacts of gold, copper and carved jade, as well as the first-ever examples of what were believed to be pre-Columbian Maya cloth and wooden weapons. Thompson shipped the bulk of the artifacts to the Peabody Museum at Harvard University.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Elaborate stone facades in Chichen Itza's \"Monjas\" complex in 1902\nThe Maya name \"Chichen Itza\" means \"At the mouth of the well of the Itza.\" This derives from *chi'*, meaning \"mouth\" or \"edge\", and *ch\u02bcen* or *ch\u02bce\u02bcen*, meaning \"well\". *Itz\u00e1* is the name of an ethnic-lineage group that gained political and economic dominance of the northern peninsula. One possible translation for Itza is \"enchanter (or enchantment) of the water,\"[5] from *its* (itz), \"sorcerer\", and *ha*, \"water\".[6]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Excavations next to the Temple of Kukulc\u00e1n (\"El Castillo\") began in 2009\nIn 1926, the Mexican government charged Edward Thompson with theft, claiming he stole the artifacts from the Cenote Sagrado and smuggled them out of the country. The government seized the Hacienda Chich\u00e9n. Thompson, who was in the United States at the time, never returned to Yucat\u00e1n. He wrote about his research and investigations of the Maya culture in a book *People of the Serpent* published in 1932. He died in New Jersey in 1935. In 1944 the Mexican Supreme Court ruled that Thompson had broken no laws and returned Chichen Itza to his heirs. The Thompsons sold the hacienda to tourism pioneer Fernando Barbachano Peon.[37]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Cobos Palma, Rafael (2005) [2004]. \"Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1: Settlement and Hegemony During the Terminal Classic Period\".

The first was sponsored by the National Geographic, and the second by private interests. Both projects were supervised by Mexico's National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH). INAH has conducted an ongoing effort to excavate and restore other monuments in the archeological zone, including the Osario, Akab Dzib, and several buildings in Chich\u00e9n Viejo (Old Chichen).\n\n\nIn 2009, to investigate construction that predated El Castillo, Yucatec archeologists began excavations adjacent to El Castillo under the direction of Rafael (Rach) Cobos.\n\n\n\n## Site description[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Aerial view of a small portion of Chichen Itza\nChich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 is located in the eastern portion of Yucat\u00e1n state in Mexico.[10] The northern Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula is karst, and the rivers in the interior all run underground. There are four visible, natural sink holes, called cenotes, that could have provided plentiful water year round at Chichen, making it attractive for settlement. Of these cenotes, the \"Cenote Sagrado\" or \"Sacred Cenote\" (also variously known as the Sacred Well or Well of Sacrifice), is the most famous.[11] In 2015, scientists determined that there is a hidden cenote under the Temple of Kukulkan, which has never been seen by archeologists.[12]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2007, Chichen Itza's Temple of Kukulc\u00e1n (El Castillo) was named one of the New Seven Wonders of the World after a worldwide vote.[76] Despite the fact that the vote was sponsored by a commercial enterprise, and that its methodology was criticized, the vote was embraced by government and tourism officials in Mexico who projected that as a result of the publicity the number of tourists to Chichen would double by 2012.[nb 7][77] The ensuing publicity re-ignited debate in Mexico over the ownership of the site, which culminated on 29 March 2010 when the state of Yucat\u00e1n purchased the land upon which the most recognized monuments rest from owner Hans Juergen Thies Barbachano.[78]\n\n\nINAH, which manages the site, has closed a number of monuments to public access. While visitors can walk around them, they can no longer climb them or go inside their chambers. Climbing access to El Castillo was closed after a San Diego, California, woman fell to her death in 2006.[50]\n\n\n\n## Photograph gallery[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** /t\u0283i\u02d0\u02c8t\u0283\u025bn i\u02d0\u02c8ts\u0251\u02d0/ *chee-CHEN eet-SAH*, Spanish: *Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1* [t\u0283i\u02c8t\u0283en i\u02c8tsa], often with the emphasis reversed in English to /\u02c8t\u0283i\u02d0t\u0283\u025bn \u02c8i\u02d0ts\u0259/ *CHEE-chen EET-s\u0259*; from Yucatec Maya: *Chi\u02bcch\u02bc\u00e8en \u00ccitsha\u02bc* [t\u0255\u02b0i\u0294t\u0255\u02bc\u00e8\u02d0n \u00ec\u02d0ts\u02b0a\u0294] (Barrera V\u00e1squez 1980) \"at the mouth of the well of the Itza people\"\n2. **^** Concerning the legal basis of the ownership of Chichen and other sites of patrimony, see Breglia (2006), in particular Chapter 3, \"Chichen Itza, a Century of Privatization\".

It was, however, toward the end of the Late Classic and into the early part of the Terminal Classic that the site became a major regional capital, centralizing and dominating political, sociocultural, economic, and ideological life in the northern Maya lowlands. The ascension of Chichen Itza roughly correlates with the decline and fragmentation of the major centers of the southern Maya lowlands.\n\n\nAs Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 rose to prominence, the cities of Yaxuna (to the south) and Coba (to the east) were suffering decline. These two cities had been mutual allies, with Yaxuna dependent upon Coba. At some point in the 10th century Coba lost a significant portion of its territory, isolating Yaxuna, and Chichen Itza may have directly contributed to the collapse of both cities.[23]\n\n\n\n### Decline[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMain article: El Castillo, Chichen Itza\n\n![](image)\nThe descent of the serpent effect demonstrated at Kukulc\u00e1n during the night show with artificial lighting\n![](image)\nThe descent of the serpent effect observed at Kukulc\u00e1n during the 2009 spring equinox\n\nDominating the North Platform of Chichen Itza is the *Temple of Kukulc\u00e1n* (a Maya feathered serpent deity similar to the Aztec Quetzalcoatl).

The Colosseum had been completed up to the third story by the time of Vespasian's death in 79. The top level was finished by his son, Titus, in 80,[3] and the inaugural games were held in 80 or 81 AD.[23] Dio Cassius recounts that over 9,000 wild animals were killed during the inaugural games of the amphitheatre. Commemorative coinage was issued celebrating the inauguration.[24] The building was remodelled further under Vespasian's younger son, the newly designated Emperor Domitian, who constructed the *hypogeum*, a series of tunnels used to house animals and slaves. He also added a gallery to the top of the Colosseum to increase its seating capacity.[25]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSevere damage was inflicted on the Colosseum by the great earthquake in 1349, causing the outer south side, lying on a less stable alluvial terrain, to collapse. Much of the tumbled stone was reused to build palaces, churches, hospitals and other buildings elsewhere in Rome. In 1377, after the Pope's return to Rome, the Colosseum was restored by a religious order called Arciconfraternita del SS. Salvatore ad Sancta Sanctorum, who then inhabited a northern portion of it until as late as the early 19th century.[29][30] The interior of the amphitheater was extensively stripped of stone, which was reused elsewhere, or (in the case of the marble fa\u00e7ade) was burned to make quicklime.[20] The iron clamps[20] which held the stonework together were pried or hacked out of the walls, leaving numerous pockmarks which still scar the building today.\n\n\n\n### Modern[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nConstruction was funded by the opulent spoils taken from the Jewish Temple after the First Jewish\u2013Roman War in 70 AD led to the Siege of Jerusalem. According to a reconstructed inscription found on the site, \"the emperor Vespasian ordered this new amphitheatre to be erected from his general's share of the booty.\" It is often assumed that Jewish prisoners of war were brought back to Rome and contributed to the massive workforce needed for the construction of the amphitheatre, but there is no ancient evidence for that; it would, nonetheless, be commensurate with Roman practice to add humiliation to the defeated population.[22] Along with this free source of unskilled labor, teams of professional Roman builders, engineers, artists, painters and decorators undertook the more specialized tasks necessary for building the Colosseum. The Colosseum was constructed with several different materials: wood, limestone, tuff, tiles, cement, and mortar.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe **Colosseum** (/\u02cck\u0252l\u0259\u02c8si\u02d0\u0259m/ *KOL-\u0259-SEE-\u0259m*; Italian: *Colosseo* [kolos\u02c8s\u025b\u02d0o]) is an elliptical amphitheatre in the centre of the city of Rome, Italy, just east of the Roman Forum. It is the largest ancient amphitheatre ever built, and is still the largest standing amphitheatre in the world, despite its age. Construction began under the emperor Vespasian (r.\u200969\u201379\u00a0AD) in 72[1] and was completed in AD 80 under his successor and heir, Titus (r.\u200979\u201381).[2] Further modifications were made during the reign of Domitian (r.\u200981\u201396).[3] The three emperors who were patrons of the work are known as the Flavian dynasty, and the amphitheatre was named the **Flavian Amphitheatre** (Latin: *Amphitheatrum Flavium*; Italian: *Anfiteatro Flavio* [a\u0271fite\u02c8a\u02d0tro \u02c8fla\u02d0vjo]) by later classicists and archaeologists for its association with their family name (Flavius).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Sestertius of Titus celebrating the inauguration of the Colosseum (minted 80 AD).\n![](image)A map of central Rome during the Roman Empire, with the Colosseum at the upper right corner\nThe site chosen was a flat area on the floor of a low valley between the Caelian, Esquiline and Palatine Hills, through which a canalised stream ran as well as an artificial lake/marsh.[21] By the 2nd century BC the area was densely inhabited. It was devastated by the Great Fire of Rome in 64 AD, following which Nero seized much of the area to add to his personal domain. He built the grandiose Domus Aurea on the site, in front of which he created an artificial lake surrounded by pavilions, gardens and porticoes. The existing Aqua Claudia aqueduct was extended to supply water to the area and the gigantic bronze Colossus of Nero was set up nearby at the entrance to the Domus Aurea.[20] \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the 8th century, an epigram attributed to the Venerable Bede celebrated the symbolic significance of the statue in a prophecy that is variously quoted: *Quamdiu stat Colis\u00e6us, stat et Roma; quando cadet colis\u00e6us, cadet et Roma; quando cadet Roma, cadet et mundus* (\"as long as the Colossus stands, so shall Rome; when the Colossus falls, Rome shall fall; when Rome falls, so falls the world\").[18] This is often mistranslated to refer to the Colosseum rather than the Colossus (as in, for instance, Byron's poem *Childe Harold's Pilgrimage*). However, at the time that the Pseudo-Bede wrote, the masculine noun *coliseus* was applied to the statue rather than to the amphitheatre.[19]\n\n\nThe Colossus did eventually fall, possibly being pulled down to reuse its bronze. The statue itself was largely forgotten and only its base survives, between the Colosseum and the nearby Temple of Venus and Roma.[20]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Construction, inauguration, and Roman renovations[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAncient Roman amphitheatre, a landmark of Rome, Italy\n\nFor other uses, see Colosseum (disambiguation).\n\n\"Colosseo\" redirects here.

It was not fully repaired until about 240 and underwent further repairs in 250 or 252 and again in 320. Honorius banned the practice of gladiator fights in 399 and again in 404. Gladiatorial fights are last mentioned around 435.[20] An inscription records the restoration of various parts of the Colosseum under Theodosius II and Valentinian III (reigned 425\u2013455), possibly to repair damage caused by a major earthquake in 443; more work followed in 484[27] and 508. The arena continued to be used for contests well into the 6th century. Animal hunts continued until at least 523, when Anicius Maximus celebrated his consulship with some *venationes*, criticised by King Theodoric the Great for their high cost.[20]\n\n\n\n### Medieval[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Map of medieval Rome depicting the Colosseum\nThe Colosseum underwent several radical changes of use. By the late 6th century a small chapel had been built into the structure of the amphitheater, though this apparently did not confer any particular religious significance on the building as a whole. The arena was converted into a cemetery. The numerous vaulted spaces in the arcades under the seating were converted into housing and workshops, and are recorded as still being rented out as late as the 12th century. Around 1200 the Frangipani family took over the Colosseum and fortified it, apparently using it as a castle. In the early to mid 14th century, the Pope's relocation to Avignon caused a population decline in Rome that left the region insecure. The colosseum was largely abandoned by the public and became a popular den for bandits.[28]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n41. **^** Squires, Nick (23 June 2010). \"Colosseum to open gladiator passageways for first time\". *The Daily Telegraph*.

Pope Sixtus V (1585\u20131590) planned to turn the building into a wool factory to provide employment for Rome's prostitutes, though this proposal fell through with his premature death.[31] In 1671 Cardinal Altieri authorized its use for bullfights; a public outcry caused the idea to be hastily abandoned.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)*Interior of the Colosseum, Rome* (1832) by Thomas Cole, showing the Stations of the Cross around the arena and the extensive vegetation\nLater popes initiated various stabilization and restoration projects, removing the extensive vegetation which had overgrown the structure and threatened to damage it further. The fa\u00e7ade was reinforced with triangular brick wedges in 1807 and 1827, and the interior was repaired in 1831, 1846 and in the 1930s. The arena substructure was partly excavated in 1810\u20131814 and 1874 and was fully exposed under Benito Mussolini in the 1930s.[20]\n\n\nThe Colosseum is today one of Rome's most popular tourist attractions, receiving millions of visitors annually. The effects of pollution and general deterioration over time prompted a major restoration programme carried out between 1993 and 2000, at a cost of Lire\u00a040\u00a0billion ($19.3m / \u20ac20.6m at 2000 prices).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)The exterior of the Colosseum, showing the partially intact outer wall (left) and the mostly intact inner wall (center and right)\nUnlike Roman theatres that were built into hillsides, the Colosseum is an entirely free-standing structure. It derives its basic exterior and interior architecture from that of two theatres back to back. It is elliptical in plan and is 189 meters (615\u00a0ft / 640 Roman feet) long, and 156 meters (510\u00a0ft / 528 Roman feet) wide, with a base area of 24,000 square metres (6 acres). The height of the outer wall is 48 meters (157\u00a0ft / 165 Roman feet). The perimeter originally measured 545 meters (1,788\u00a0ft / 1,835 Roman feet). The central arena is an ellipse 87\u00a0m (287\u00a0ft) long and 55\u00a0m (180\u00a0ft) wide, surrounded by a wall 5\u00a0m (15\u00a0ft) high, above which rose tiers of seating.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n19. **^** Ensoli, Serena; La Rocca, Eugenio (2000). *Aurea Roma: dalla citt\u00e0 pagana alla citt\u00e0 cristiana* (in Italian).

It could hold an estimated 50,000 to 80,000 spectators at various points in its history,[4][5] having an average audience of some 65,000;[6] it was used for gladiatorial contests and public spectacles including animal hunts, executions, re-enactments of famous battles, and dramas based on Roman mythology, and briefly mock sea battles. The building ceased to be used for entertainment in the early medieval era. It was later reused for such purposes as housing, workshops, quarters for a religious order, a fortress, a quarry, and a Christian shrine.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOriginally, the building's Latin name was simply *amphitheatrum*, 'amphitheatre'.[9] Though the modern name Flavian Amphitheatre (Latin: *Amphitheatrum Flavium*) is often used, there is no evidence it was used in classical antiquity.[9] This name refers to the patronage of the Flavian dynasty, during whose reigns the building was constructed, but the structure is better known as the Colosseum.[9] In antiquity, Romans may have referred to the Colosseum by the unofficial name *Amphitheatrum Caesareum* (with *Caesareum* an adjective pertaining to the title *Caesar*), but this name may have been strictly poetic[10][11] as it was not exclusive to the Colosseum; Vespasian and Titus, builders of the Colosseum, also constructed a Flavian Amphitheatre in Puteoli (modern Pozzuoli).[12]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Cross-section from the *Lexikon der gesamten Technik* (1904) Although the Colossus was preserved, much of the Domus Aurea was torn down. The lake was filled in and the land reused as the location for the new Flavian Amphitheatre. Gladiatorial schools and other support buildings were constructed nearby within the former grounds of the Domus Aurea. Vespasian's decision to build the Colosseum on the site of Nero's lake can be seen as a populist gesture of returning to the people an area of the city which Nero had appropriated for his own use. In contrast to many other amphitheatres, which were on the outskirts of a city, the Colosseum was constructed in the city centre, in effect, placing it both symbolically and geographically at the heart of Rome.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Interior of the Colosseum by late nineteenth century photographer Francis Frith\nThe name *Colosseum* is believed to be derived from a colossal statue of Nero on the model of the Colossus of Rhodes.[9][3] The giant bronze sculpture of Nero as a solar deity was moved to its position beside the amphitheatre by the emperor Hadrian (r.\u2009117\u2013138).[9] The word *colosseum* is a neuter Latin noun formed from the adjective *colosseus*, meaning \"gigantic\" or \"colossean\".[9] By the year 1000 the Latin name \"Colosseum\" had been coined to refer to the amphitheatre from the nearby \"Colossus Solis\".[13]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n15. **^** Mentioned in Suetonius, \"Vespasian\" 18; Pliny's Natural History XXXIV.45; Cassius Dio LXV.15.\n16. **^** Hist.

Its architects adopted solutions very similar to those used in modern stadia to deal with the same problem. The amphitheatre was ringed by eighty entrances at ground level, 76 of which were used by ordinary spectators.[3] Each entrance and exit was numbered, as was each staircase. The northern main entrance was reserved for the Roman Emperor and his aides, whilst the other three axial entrances were most likely used by the elite. All four axial entrances were richly decorated with painted stucco reliefs, of which fragments survive. Many of the original outer entrances have disappeared with the collapse of the perimeter wall, but entrances XXIII (23) to LIIII (54) survive.[20]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 2011 Diego Della Valle, head of the shoe firm Tod's, entered into an agreement with local officials to sponsor a \u20ac25\u00a0million restoration of the Colosseum. Work was planned to begin at the end of 2011, taking up to two and a half years.[44] Due to the controversial nature of using a public\u2013private partnership to fund the restoration, work was delayed and began in 2013. The restoration is the first full cleaning and repair in the Colosseum's history.[45] The first stage is to clean and restore the Colosseum's arcaded fa\u00e7ade and replace the metal enclosures that block the ground-level arches. After three years, the work was completed on 1 July 2016, when the Italian minister of culture, Dario Franceschini, also announced that the funds have been committed to replace the floors by the end of 2018. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe outer wall is estimated to have required over 100,000 cubic metres (3.5\u00a0million cubic feet) of travertine stone which were set without mortar; they were held together by 300 tons of iron clamps.[20] However, it has suffered extensive damage over the centuries, with large segments having collapsed following earthquakes. The north side of the perimeter wall is still standing; the distinctive triangular brick wedges at each end are modern additions, having been constructed in the early 19th century to shore up the wall. The remainder of the present-day exterior of the Colosseum is in fact the original interior wall.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n67. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"The Coliseum\". *Catholic Encyclopedia*.

Shah Jahan presented Maharaja Jai Singh I with a large palace in the centre of Agra in exchange for the land.[46] An area of roughly 1.2 hectares (3 acres) was excavated, filled with dirt to reduce seepage, and levelled at 50 metres (160\u00a0ft) above the riverbank level. In the tomb area, piles were dug and filled with stone and rubble to form the footings of the tomb. Instead of lashed bamboo, workmen constructed a colossal brick scaffold that mirrored the tomb. The scaffold was so enormous that foremen expected it to take years to dismantle.[47]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nConstruction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but work continued on other phases of the project for another 10 years. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around \u20b932\u00a0million, which in 2023 would be approximately \u20b935\u00a0billion.[7] The construction project employed some 20,000 artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by Ustad Ahmad Lahori, the emperor's court architect. Various types of symbolism have been employed in the Taj to reflect natural beauty and divinity.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Taj Mahal was commissioned by Shah Jahan in 1631, to be built in the memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal, who died on 17 June that year, while giving birth to their 14th child, Gauhara Begum.[14][15] Construction started in 1632,[16] and the mausoleum was completed in 1648, while the surrounding buildings and garden were finished five years later.[17] The imperial court documenting Shah Jahan's grief after the death of Mumtaz Mahal illustrates the love story held as the inspiration for the Taj Mahal.[18] According to contemporary historians Muhammad Amin Qazvini, Abdul Hamid Lahori and Muhammad Saleh Kamboh, he did not show the same level of affection to others as he had shown her while she was alive. He avoided royal affairs for a week due to his grief, along with giving up listening to music and dressing lavishly for two years. Shah Jahan was enamored by the beauty of the land at the south side of Agra on which a mansion belonging to Raja Jai Singh I stood. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe plinth and tomb took some 12 years to complete. The remaining parts of the complex took an additional 10 years and were completed in order of minarets, mosque and jawab, and gateway. Since the complex was built in stages, discrepancies exist in completion dates due to differing opinions on \"completion\". Construction of the mausoleum itself was essentially completed by 1643[16] while work on the outlying buildings continued for years. Estimates of the cost of construction vary due to difficulties in estimating costs across time. The total cost at the time has been estimated to be about \u20b9 32 million,[16] which is around \u20b9 52.8\u00a0billion ($827\u00a0million US) based on 2015 values.[52]\n\n\n\n## Symbolism[edit]\n\n\nDue to the global attention that it has received and the millions of visitors it attracts, the Taj Mahal has become a prominent image that is associated with India, and in this way has become a symbol of India itself.[53]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe **Taj Mahal** (/\u02cct\u0251\u02d0d\u0292 m\u0259\u02c8h\u0251\u02d0l, \u02cct\u0251\u02d0\u0292-/; lit.\u2009'Crown of the Palace')[4][5][6] is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of the river Yamuna in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India. It was commissioned in 1631 by the fifth Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan (r.\u20091628\u20131658) to house the tomb of his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThis place was chosen for the construction of Mumtaz's tomb by Shah Jahan and Jai Singh agreed to donate it to the emperor.[19]\n\n\n\nShah Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal\n* ![\"Shah Jahan on a globe\" from the Smithsonian Institution](image)\n\n\"Shah Jahan on a globe\" from the Smithsonian Institution\n* ![Artistic depiction of Mumtaz Mahal](image)\n\nArtistic depiction of Mumtaz Mahal\n\n## Architecture and design[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Origins and architecture of the Taj Mahal\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n8. **^** \"Views of Taj Mahal\". *www.tajmahal.gov.in*.

Oak's theory.[102][103] In August 2017, Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) stated there was no evidence to suggest the monument ever housed a temple.[104] Bharatiya Janata Party's Vinay Katiyar in 2017 claimed that the 17th century monument was built by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan after destroying a Hindu temple called \"Tejo Mahalaya\" and it housed a Shiva linga. This claim had also been made by another BJP member Laxmikant Bajpai in 2014. The BJP government's Union Minister of Culture Mahesh Sharma stated in November 2015 during a session of the parliament, that there was no evidence that it was a temple. The theories about Taj Mahal being a Shiva temple started circulating when Oak released his 1989 book *Taj Mahal: The True Story*. He claimed it was built in 1155 AD and not in the 17th century, as stated by the ASI.[105]\n\n\n\n## Gallery[edit]\n\n\n* Taj Mahal\n* ![Eastern view in the morning](image)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAnother myth suggests that beating the silhouette of the finial will cause water to come forth. To this day, officials find broken bangles surrounding the silhouette.[97]\n\n\nSeveral myths, none of which are supported by the archaeological record, have appeared asserting that people other than Shah Jahan and the original architects were responsible for the construction of the Taj Mahal. For instance, in 2000, India's Supreme Court dismissed P. N. Oak's petition[98] to declare that a Hindu king built the Taj Mahal.[95][99] In 2005, a similar petition was dismissed by the Allahabad High Court. This case was brought by Amar Nath Mishra, a social worker and preacher who claimed that the Taj Mahal was built by the Hindu King Parmal Dev in 1196.[100]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Taj Mahal was constructed using materials from all over India and Asia. It is believed over 1,000 elephants were used to transport building materials. Some 22,000 labourers, painters, embroidery artists and stonecutters were used.[48] The translucent white marble was brought from Makrana, Rajasthan, the jasper from the Punjab region, jade and crystal from China. The turquoise was from Tibet and the Lapis lazuli from Afghanistan, while the sapphire came from Sri Lanka and the carnelian from Arabia. In all, 28 types of precious and semi-precious stone were inlaid into the white marble.[49]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being \"the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage\". It is regarded by many as the best example of Mughal architecture and a symbol of India's rich history. The Taj Mahal attracts 7-8\u00a0million visitors a year,[8] and in 2007 it was declared a winner of the New 7 Wonders of the World (2000\u20132007) initiative.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nAbdul Hamid Lahori, in his book from 1636 *Padshahnama*, refers to the Taj Mahal as *rauza-i munawwara* (Perso-Arabic: \u0631\u0648\u0636\u0647 \u0645\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0631\u0647, *rawdah-i munawwarah*), meaning the illumined or illustrious tomb.[9]\nThe current name for the Taj Mahal is of Urdu origin, and believed to be derived from Arabic and Persian, with the words *t\u0101j mahall* meaning \"crown\" (*t\u0101j*) \"palace\" (*mahall*).[10][11][4] The name \"Taj\" came from the corruption of the second syllable of \"Mumtaz\".[12][13]\n\n\n\n## Inspiration[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe small town to the south of the Taj, known as Taj Ganji or Mumtazabad, was initially constructed with caravanserais, bazaars and markets to serve the needs of visitors and workers.[83] Lists of recommended travel destinations often feature the Taj Mahal, which also appears in several listings of seven wonders of the modern world, including the recently announced New Seven Wonders of the World, a recent poll with 100 million votes.[84]\n\n\nThe grounds are open from 06:00 to 19:00 hours on weekdays, except on Friday when the complex is open for prayers at the mosque between 12:00 and 14:00 hours. The complex is open for night viewing on the day of the full moon and two days before and after,[85] excluding Fridays and the month of Ramadan.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* DuTemple, Lesley A.

Similar claims are made for many famous buildings.[95] No evidence exists for claims that Lord William Bentinck, governor-general of India in the 1830s, supposedly planned to demolish the Taj Mahal and auction off the marble. Bentinck's biographer John Rosselli says that the story arose from Bentinck's fund-raising sale of discarded marble from Agra Fort.[96]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n39. **^** Begley 1979, p.\u00a014.\n40. **^** \"The plants growing throughout the Taj Mahal complex\". *India Tourism*.

It was suggested that his son Aurangzeb overthrew Shah Jahan before it could be built. Ruins of blackened marble across the river in the Mehtab Bagh, seemed to support this legend. However, excavations carried out in the 1990s found that they were discoloured white stones that had turned black.[91] A more credible theory for the origins of the black mausoleum was demonstrated in 2006 by archaeologists who reconstructed part of the pool in the Mehtab Bagh. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n29. **^** \"Taj Mahal \u2013 A Monument of Love in India\". *Kristian Bertel Photography*.

Upon Shah Jahan's death, Aurangzeb buried him in the mausoleum next to his wife.[61] In the 18th century, the Jat rulers of Bharatpur invaded Agra and attacked the Taj Mahal. They took away the two chandeliers, one of agate and another of silver, which were hung over the main cenotaph; they also took the gold and silver screen. Kanbo, a Mughal historian, said the gold shield which covered the 4.6-metre-high (15\u00a0ft) finial at the top of the main dome was also removed during the Jat despoilation.[62]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAccording to Ebba Koch, art historian and international expert in the understanding and interpretation of Mughal architecture and the Taj Mahal, the planning of the entire compound of the Taj symbolises earthly life and the afterlife, a subset of the symbolisation of the divine. The plan has been split into two\u00a0\u2013 one half is the white marble mausoleum itself and the gardens, and the other half is the red sandstone side meant for worldly markets. Only the mausoleum is white so as to represent the enlightenment, spirituality and faith of Mumtaz Mahal. According to the world-traveler Eleanor Roosevelt, the white symbolised the purity of real love.[59] Koch has deciphered that symbolic of Islamic teachings, the plan of the worldly side is a mirror image of the otherworldly side, and the grand gate in the middle represents the transition between the two worlds.\n\n\nThe Taj is also seen as a feminine architectural form, and is thought to embody Mumtaz Mahal herself.[60]\n\n\n\n## Later days[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThey changed the landscaping to their liking which more closely resembled the formal lawns of London.[45]\n\n\n\n### Outlying buildings[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The western building, a mosque, faces the tomb.\nThe Taj Mahal complex is bordered on three sides by crenellated red sandstone walls; the side facing the river is open. Outside the walls are several additional mausoleums, including those of Shah Jahan's other wives, and a larger tomb for Mumtaz's favourite servant.[*citation needed*] These structures, composed primarily of red sandstone, are typical of the smaller Mughal tombs of the era. The garden-facing inner sides of the wall are fronted by columned arcades, a feature typical of Hindu temples which was later incorporated into Mughal mosques. The wall is interspersed with domed *chattris*, and small buildings that may have been viewing areas or watch towers like the Music House, which is now used as a museum.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Official website of the Taj Mahal\n* Description of the Taj Mahal at the Archaeological Survey of India\n* Profile of the Taj Mahal at UNESCO\n* \"Outlying Buildings\". *Taj Mahal*.

UNESCO documented more than 2 million visitors in 2001,[77] which had increased to about 7\u20138\u00a0million in 2014.[78] A three-tier pricing system is in place, with a significantly lower entrance fee for Indian citizens and more expensive ones for foreigners. As of 2022[update], the fee for Indian citizens was \u20b950, for citizens of SAARC and BIMSTEC countries, it was \u20b9540 and for other foreign tourists, it was \u20b91,100.[79] Most tourists visit in the cooler months of October, November and February. Polluting traffic is not allowed near the complex and tourists must either walk from parking areas or catch an electric bus. The Khawasspuras (northern courtyards) are currently being restored for use as a new visitor centre.[80][81] In 2019, to address overtourism, the site instituted fines for visitors who stayed longer than three hours.[82]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Al\u012b J\u0101v\u012bd, Tabassum Javeed (2008). *World Heritage Monuments and Related Edifices in India, Volume 1*.

Another theory that a Frenchman, Austin of Bordeaux designed the Taj was promoted by William Henry Sleeman based on the work of Jean-Baptiste Tavernier. These ideas were revived by Father Hosten and discussed again by E.B. Havell and served as the basis for subsequent theories and controversies.[101]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n103. **^** \"Is Taj Mahal a mausoleum or a Shiva temple?

The inlay work is not pietra dura, but a lapidary of precious and semiprecious gemstones.[35] The inner chamber is an octagon with the design allowing for entry from each face, although only the door facing the garden to the south is used. The interior walls are about 25 metres (82\u00a0ft) high and are topped by a \"false\" interior dome decorated with a sun motif. Eight pishtaq arches define the space at ground level and, as with the exterior, each lower pishtaq is crowned by a second pishtaq about midway up the wall.[36] The four central upper arches form balconies or viewing areas, and each balcony's exterior window has an intricate screen or *jali* a grill lattice cut from marble. In addition to the light from the balcony screens, light enters through roof openings covered by chattris at the corners. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe planning and structure of the Taj Mahal, from the building itself to the gardens and beyond, is symbolic of Mumtaz Mahal's mansion in the garden of Paradise.[55] The concept of Gardens of Paradise is extended into the building of the mausoleum as well. Colorful vines and flowers decorate the interior, and are filled in with semi-precious stones using a technique called pietra dura, or as the Mughals called it, *parchin kari*.[57] The building appears to slightly change colour depending on the time of day and the weather. The sky has not only been incorporated in the design through the reflecting pools but also through the surface of the building itself. This is another way to imply the presence of Allah at the site.[58]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
