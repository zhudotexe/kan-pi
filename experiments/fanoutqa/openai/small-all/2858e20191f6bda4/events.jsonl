The most recent peak to have its first ever ascent is Saser Kangri II East, in India, on 24 August 2011.\n\n\nThe highest mountain outside of Asia is Aconcagua (6,961 m or 22,838 ft), the 189th highest in the world.[7]\n\n\n\n\n## List of world's highest peaks[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThis article is about mountains by height from sea level.

They are probably quite accurate for the rarely climbed peaks (though omissions were noted), but greatly underestimate the number of ascending parties on the easier and/or more popular mountains, like most eight-thousanders. For instance, Mount Everest has been scaled 2,251 times by individuals up to 2004 .[14]\n7. **^** Given the large differences between multiple \"definitive\" measurements of Mount Everest, the traditional 8,848 m is listed. For more information, see Mount Everest#Surveys.\n8. **^** Cho Oyu's height is 8,188 m according to the Nepal Survey's 1996 topographical map,[15] which represents the best known measurement to date.

Still, heights or prominences may be revised, so that the order of the list may change and even new mountains could enter the list over time. To be safe, the list has been extended to include all 7,200 m (23,622 ft) peaks.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nA few such peaks and mountains with nearly sufficient prominence are included in this list, and given a rank of \"S\".\n\n\nIt is very unlikely that all given heights are correct to the nearest metre; indeed, the sea level is often problematic to define when a mountain is remote from the sea. Different sources often differ by many metres, and the heights given below may well differ from those elsewhere in this encyclopedia. As an extreme example, Ulugh Muztagh on the north Tibetan Plateau is often listed as 7,723 m (25,338 ft) to 7,754 m (25,440 ft), but appears to be only 6,973 m (22,877 ft) to 6,987 m (22,923 ft). Some mountains differ by > 100 m (330 ft) on different maps, while even very thorough current measurements of Mount Everest range from 8,840 m (29,003 ft) to 8,848 m (29,029 ft). These discrepancies serve to emphasize the uncertainties in the listed heights.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | Annapurna Himalaya | 28°35′06″N 83°59′24″E﻿ / ﻿28.58500°N 83.99000°E﻿ / 28.58500; 83.99000﻿ (42.

Mauna Loa (4,169 m or 13,678 ft) is the largest mountain on Earth in terms of base area (about 2,000 sq mi or 5,200 km2) and volume (about 10,000 cu mi or 42,000 km3), although, due to the intergrade of lava from Kilauea, Hualalai and Mauna Kea, the volume can only be estimated based on surface area and height of the edifice. Mount Kilimanjaro is the largest non-shield volcano in terms of both base area (245 sq mi or 635 km2) and volume (1,150 cu mi or 4,793 km3). Mount Logan is the largest non-volcanic mountain in base area (120 sq mi or 311 km2).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | Batura Karakoram | 36°26′26″N 74°40′51″E﻿ / ﻿36.44056°N 74.68083°E﻿ / 36.44056; 74.68083﻿ (38.
