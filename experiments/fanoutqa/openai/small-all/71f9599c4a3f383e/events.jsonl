The five sports included are tennis, baseball, bowling, golf, and boxing. Players use the Wii Remote to mimic actions performed in real-life sports, such as swinging a tennis racket.[1] The rules for each game are simplified to make them more accessible to new players. The game also features training and fitness modes that monitor players' progress in the sports.[2]\n\n\n*Wii Sports* was well-received by critics and audiences.[3] It was a huge commercial success, selling 82 million copies worldwide, becoming the best-selling video game produced by Nintendo in the world.[3] It has been featured on television in Wii commercials, news reports, and other programming.[4][5][6][7] The game has become a popular means for social gatherings and competitions among players of varying ages.[5][8][9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Wii Sports |\n| --- |\n| ![Artwork of a vertical rectangular box.

Boxing utilizes both Wii Remote and Nunchuk gestures to control both of the player's arms. The player moves the remote in a similar manner to how the separate games are played in real life; for example, holding and swinging the Wii Remote like a golf club, baseball bat, tennis racket or bowling ball.[1] Some aspects of the gameplay are computer controlled. In tennis, player movement is controlled by the game's AI, while the swinging of the racket is controlled by the player. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSee also: Wii (video game series) § Wii Sports\n\n### *Wii Sports Resort*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Wii Sports Resort\n\nA sequel, *Wii Sports Resort*, was first revealed at Nintendo's E3 2008 presentation.[110] Development moved forward after the extent of the Wii MotionPlus was realized, though the idea for a sequel existed sooner.[111] The game features 12 sports, (2 from the original) including swordplay, wakeboarding, Frisbee, archery, basketball, table tennis, golf, bowling, power cruising, canoeing, cycling, and air sports (parachuting and piloting).[112] The game was first released in South Korea on June 24, 2009[113] and in Japan on June 25, 2009[114] before being released in other markets in July 2009. As of March 2020, the game has sold over 30 million units, and is a fan-favorite for kids all across the globe.[115][116][117]\n\n\n\n### *Wii Sports Club*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Wii Sports Club\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nKatsuya Eguchi, who managed Software Development Group 2 at Nintendo Entertainment Analysis and Development, produced *Wii Sports*.[15] With the Wii, Nintendo desired to reach people who had not played video games before. To do this they needed software that allowed both long time and first time players to interact together in a fun way.[16] Nintendo also wanted players to use the system daily and intended the game to be the console's flagship title to help accomplish this.[17] *Wii Sports* was designed as a simple introductory line meant to offer something for both gamers and non-gamers.[18] Sports were chosen as the theme because of the widespread familiarity with them. Rather than feature professional athletes or have realistic graphics, the game was designed to be simple so that anyone could play. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nGameplay like running towards a ball in tennis was excluded to maintain simplicity.[15] At one point in development, Super Mario characters were used, but were removed from the game because of feedback from players who preferred Miis.[19] The game supports a 16:9 widescreen ratio and progressive scan, runs at 60 frames per second,[10] and makes use of the Wii Remote's accelerometer to interpret the player's motion.[20] Motion-sensing actions, like pitching and hitting, were prioritized to make them as realistic as possible.[19] Because Nintendo did not expect players to purchase the Wii solely to play *Wii Sports*, they bundled the game with the console; Nintendo believed players would be more likely to play *Wii Sports* through this distribution method. They also felt players that enjoyed the game would increase its popularity by word of mouth.[21]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n*Wii Sports*, a major factor in the Wii's worldwide success,[82] was the first game among a number of core Wii games being developed at the same time, with the same philosophy; other games were released as *Wii Play*, *Wii Fit*, and *Wii Music*.[83] A direct sequel to *Wii Sports*, titled *Wii Sports Resort*, was released in 2009.[84] The game, along with *Wii Fit*, has been credited with attracting more casual, female, and elderly gamers.[85] It has also been cited as a game that can provide a bonding experience among family members, and as a means of exercising and losing weight when played regularly.[86][87] A study involving 13- to 15‑year-old teenagers was conducted by the Liverpool John Moores University and concluded that players used 2% more energy than by playing on other consoles. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n*Wii* series\n |\n| --- |\n| *Wii Sports* | * *Wii Sports*\n* *Resort*\n* *Club*\n* *Nintendo Switch Sports*\n | ![](image)\n |\n| *Wii Fit* | * *Wii Fit*\n* *U*\n |\n| Standalone games | * *Play*\n* *Play: Motion*\n* *Party*\n* *Party U*\n* *Chess*\n* *Music*\n |\n| Related | * Mii\n* Wii\n* Wii Balance Board\n* Wii MotionPlus\n* Wii U\n* *Super Smash Bros.*\n\t+ *for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U*\n\t+ *Ultimate*\n |\n| * ![](image) **Category**\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)A picture of a Wii Sports disc\n***Wii Sports*** is a 2006 sports simulation video game developed and published by Nintendo for the Wii video game console. The 1.0 (pre-release) version of the game was released in North America along with the Wii on November 19, 2006, and the 1.1 version was released in Japan, Australia, Europe, and North America over the following months. It was included as a pack-in game with the console in all territories except Japan, making it the first sports game included with the launch of a Nintendo system since *Mario's Tennis* for the Virtual Boy in 1995. The game is available on its own as part of the Nintendo Selects collection of games.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n*Wii Sports* has become a popular means for social gatherings and competitions. Residents at senior centers and retirement homes have formed leagues using *Wii Sports* bowling.[8][99] After its Australian release, Nintendo and Myer, an Australian department store chain, held a *Wii Sports* tennis tournament in January 2007 in Melbourne, Australia.[9] The winners competed against professional tennis players Pat Cash and Mark Woodforde, and were awarded new Wiis.[100] An unofficial *Wii Sports* tennis tournament titled \"Wiimbledon\" was held in the Brooklyn, New York bar Barcade on June 23, 2007.[101] It featured 128 competitors, many of whom were dressed in costumes.[5][102]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n42. **^** Jason Joo (24 November 2006). \"Wii Sports Review (Wii)\". *Nintendo Life*.

The game was featured as both a video demonstration and an on-stage playable demo. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn September 18, 2013, Nintendo announced *Wii Sports Club* for the Wii U Nintendo eShop. The game features the five games of *Wii Sports* remade in high-definition graphics, with support for the Wii MotionPlus (similar to *Wii Sports Resort*) and online multiplayer. The game uses a \"Club\" system, in which players are registered to regional or national clubs, communicating with each other via Miiverse, and compete against other clubs for rankings. After a 24-hour free trial period, players can purchase a day pass to access all of the games, or purchase full access to the individual games.

Players control the three lead protagonists throughout single-player and switch among them, both during and outside missions. The story is centred on the heist sequences, and many missions involve shooting and driving gameplay.

Much of the development work constituted the open world's creation, and several team members conducted field research around California to capture footage for the design team. The game's soundtrack features an original score composed by a team of producers who collaborated over several years. *Grand Theft Auto V* was released in September 2013 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, in November 2014 for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, in April 2015 for Windows, and in March 2022 for the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n20. **^** Petit, Carolyn (2 May 2013). \"Grand Theft Auto V: The Making of a Great Heist Sequence\". *GameSpot*.

Editor Rob Crossley said that for the first time, Rockstar created an \"utterly beautiful\" open world. He found that the game did away with *Grand Theft Auto IV*'s repetitive mission design and focused instead on fun gameplay.[240] In May, IGN ranked it eighth on their \"Top 100 Games of a Generation\" list and called it a \"huge, raucous, and wildly ambitious bridge towards the [eighth] generation of console gaming\".[241] The next month, it placed third on IGN's \"Games of a Generation: Your Top 100\" list as voted by the site's readers.[242] In August, *Game Informer* ranked it third on their \"Top 10 Action Games Of The Generation\" list. They compared the game's quality to that of its predecessor but thought that its ensemble character set-up, varied missions and multiplayer superseded *Grand Theft Auto IV*'s placement on the list. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA fundamental design goal from the outset was to innovate on the series' core structure by giving players control of three lead protagonists instead of one.[42] The idea was first raised during *Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas*' development, but contemporaneous hardware restrictions made it infeasible.[34] Having developed two *Grand Theft Auto IV* episodic expansion packs featuring new protagonists in 2009, the team wanted to base *Grand Theft Auto V* around three simultaneously controlled protagonists.[11] The team viewed it as a spiritual successor to many of their previous games (such as *Grand Theft Auto IV*, *Red Dead Redemption* and *Max Payne 3*), and designed it to improve upon their gameplay mechanics.[19][46] They sought to improve the action gameplay by refining the shooting mechanics and cover system[47] and reworked the driving mechanics to correct *Grand Theft Auto IV*'s awkward vehicle controls.[48]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n74. **^** Nelson, Will (11 September 2021). \"The 'Grand Theft Auto V' PS5 and Xbox Series X|S trailer has left fans angry\". *NME*.

Editor Ryan McCaffrey considered that the open world's scale and detail succeeded the majority of other Xbox 360 games. He called the game \"a triumph both for gamers and for the medium itself, and it deserves its runaway success\".[237] In November 2013, *Hardcore Gamer* placed the game third on their \"Top 100 Games of the Generation\" list. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n*Grand Theft Auto V* received multiple nominations and awards from gaming publications. Before release, it won Most Anticipated Game at the 2012 Spike Video Game Awards.[59] The game was review aggregators Metacritic and GameRankings's highest-rated for the year 2013.[148][149] The game appeared on several year-end lists of 2013's best games, receiving Game of the Year wins from independent journalist Tom Chick,[150] CNET,[151] *Edge*,[152] the 31st Golden Joystick Awards,[153] the 5th Annual Inside Gaming Awards,[154] the Spike VGX 2013 Awards,[155] *Slant Magazine*[156] and *Time*.[157] It was named the Best Xbox Game by Canada.com,[158] *GameSpot*,[159] and *IGN*,[160] and the Best Multiplatform Game by *Destructoid*.[161] Rockstar Games and Rockstar North won Best Studio and Best Developer from *Edge*,[162] and the BAFTA Academy Fellowship Award at the 10th British Academy Video Games Awards.[163]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n57. **^** Stuart, Keith (2 November 2011). \"GTA 5 trailer: Rockstar unveils its Hollywood dream\". *The Guardian*.

Players can discover and extract raw materials, craft tools and items, and build structures, earthworks, and machines. Depending on their chosen game mode, players can fight hostile mobs, as well as cooperate with or compete against other players in the same world. Game modes include a survival mode (in which players must acquire resources to build in the world and maintain health) and a creative mode (in which players have unlimited resources and access to flight). The game's large community also offers a wide variety of user-generated content, such as modifications, servers, skins, texture packs, and custom maps, which add new game mechanics and possibilities.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n*Minecraft* is a 3D sandbox game that has no required goals to accomplish, allowing players a large amount of freedom in choosing how to play the game.[18] However, there is an achievement system,[19] known as \"advancements\" in the *Java Edition* of the game, \"trophies\" on the PlayStation ports, and \"achievements\" in *Bedrock Edition* and the Xbox ports.[20] Gameplay is in the first-person perspective by default, but players have the option of a third-person perspective.[21] The game world is composed of rough 3D objects—mainly cubes and fluids, and commonly called \"blocks\"—representing various materials, such as dirt, stone, ores, tree trunks, water, and lava. The core gameplay revolves around picking up and placing these objects. These blocks are arranged in a 3D grid, while players can move freely around the world. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n*Minecraft* has been referenced by other video games, such as *Torchlight II*, *Team Fortress 2*,[343][344] *Borderlands 2*, *Choplifter HD*, *Super Meat Boy*, *The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim*, *The Binding of Isaac*, *The Stanley Parable*, *FTL: Faster Than Light*,[345][346] and *Super Smash Bros.

Data packs, introduced in version 1.13 of the *Java Edition*, allow further customization, including the ability to add new advancements, dimensions, functions, loot tables, predicates, recipes, structures, tags, world generation settings, and biomes‌.[82][83]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nExamples include *Ace of Spades*, *CastleMiner*, *CraftWorld*, *FortressCraft*, *Terraria*, *BlockWorld 3D*, *Total Miner*,[378] and *Minetest*.[379] David Frampton, designer of *The Blockheads*, reported that one failure of his 2D game was the \"low resolution pixel art\" that too closely resembled the art in *Minecraft*, which resulted in \"some resistance\" from fans.[380] A homebrew adaptation of the alpha version of *Minecraft* for the Nintendo DS, titled *DScraft*, has been released; it has been noted for its similarity to the original game considering the technical limitations of the system.[381] In response to Microsoft's acquisition of Mojang and their *Minecraft* IP, various developers announced further clone titles developed specifically for Nintendo's consoles, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n*Minecraft* has received critical acclaim, winning several awards and being cited by some as one of the greatest video games ever created. Social media, parodies, adaptations, merchandise, and the annual Minecon conventions played prominent roles in popularizing the game. The game has also been used in educational environments to teach chemistry, computer-aided design, and computer science. In 2014, Mojang and the *Minecraft* intellectual property were purchased by Microsoft for US$2.5 billion. Several spin-offs have also been made, including *Minecraft: Story Mode*, *Minecraft Earth*, *Minecraft Dungeons*, and the most recent release, *Minecraft Legends*.\n\n\n\n\n## Gameplay[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n***Minecraft*** is a sandbox game developed by Mojang Studios and originally released in 2009. The game was created by Markus \"Notch\" Persson in the Java programming language. Following several early private testing versions, it was first made public in May 2009 before being fully released in November 2011, with Notch stepping down and Jens \"Jeb\" Bergensten taking over development. *Minecraft* has become the best-selling video game in history, with over 300 million copies sold[17] and nearly 140 million monthly active players as of 2023[update]. It has been ported to several platforms. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn creative mode, players have access to nearly all resources and items in the game through the inventory menu and can place or remove them instantly.[54] Players can toggle the ability to fly freely around the game world at will, and their characters do not take any damage and are not affected by hunger.[55][56] The game mode helps players focus on building and creating projects of any size without disturbance.[54]\n\n\n\n#### Other game modes[edit]\n\n\n*Minecraft* includes other game modes such as spectator mode, which allows players to fly through blocks. Hardcore mode, available only in *Java Edition*, is a survival mode variant in which, upon death, the player may only view the world in spectator mode or return to the game's menu.[57] Adventure mode is a survival mode variant with possible restrictions added by a creator of a map.[58][59][60]\n\n\n\n### Multiplayer[edit]\n\n\nSee also: *Minecraft* server\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n44. **^** Anthony, Jason (2015). \"Current Key Perspectives in Video Gaming and Religion\" (PDF). *Gamevironments* (3).

The videos usually contain screen-capture footage of the game and voice-overs.[335] Common coverage in the videos includes creations made by players, walkthroughs of various tasks, and parodies of works in popular culture. By May 2012, over four million *Minecraft*-related YouTube videos had been uploaded.[336] The game would go on to be a prominent fixture within YouTube's gaming scene during the entire 2010s; in 2014, it was the second-most searched term on the entire platform.[337] By 2018, it was still YouTube's biggest game globally.[338]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n333. **^** Silverman, Matt (1 October 2010). \"Minecraft: How Social Media Spawned a Gaming Sensation\". *Mashable*.

Players are restricted to placing or destroying blocks, which consist of grass, dirt, stone, wood, leaves, and brick.[185]\n\n\n\n#### Raspberry Pi[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nmalware was discovered in several downloadable user-made *Minecraft* skins for use with the *Java Edition* of the game.[90][91] Avast stated that nearly 50,000 accounts were infected, and when activated, the malware would attempt to reformat the user's hard drive.[91][90] Mojang promptly patched the issue, and released a statement stating that \"the code would not be run or read by the game itself\",[90] and would only run when the image containing the skin itself was opened.[92]\n\n\nIn June 2017, Mojang released an update known as the \"Discovery Update\" to the *Bedrock* version of the game.[93] The update includes a new map, a new game mode, the \"Marketplace\", a catalogue of user-generated content that gives *Minecraft* creators \"another way to make a living from the game\", and more.[94][95][96]\n\n\n\n## Development[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*Minecraft* creator Markus \"Notch\" Persson at the GDC in 2016\n![](image)*Minecraft* lead designer and creative director Jens \"Jeb\\_\" Bergensten in 2011\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_p1L1nExOWs2I1r2CWuzxt4lL","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
