Besides the *Star Wars* and *Superman* franchises, *James Bond* and *Godzilla* films are still being released periodically; all four are among the highest-grossing franchises. Some of the older films that held the record of highest-grossing film still have respectable grosses by today's standards, but no longer compete numerically against today's top-earners in an era of much higher individual ticket prices. When those prices are adjusted for inflation, however, then *Gone with the Wind*—which was the highest-grossing film outright for twenty-five years—is still the highest-grossing film of all time. All grosses on the list are expressed in U.S. dollars at their nominal value, except where stated otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n## Highest-grossing films[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n13. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021)\". *Box Office Mojo*.

Cecil B. DeMille (1932, 1947, 1949, 1952 and 1956) is in second place with five films and William Wyler (1942, 1946, 1959 and 1968) and James Cameron (1991, 1997, 2009 and 2022) are tied for third place with four films. D. W. Griffith (1915, 1916 and 1920), George Roy Hill (1966, 1969 and 1973) and the Russo brothers (2016, 2018 and 2019) all feature heavily with three films apiece. George Lucas directed two chart-toppers in 1977 and 1999, but also served in a strong creative capacity as a producer and writer in 1980, 1981, 1983, 1984 and 1989 as well. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAt least eleven films have held the record of 'highest-grossing film' since *The Birth of a Nation* assumed the top spot in 1915. Both *The Birth of a Nation* and *Gone with the Wind* spent twenty-five consecutive years apiece as the highest-grosser, with films directed by Steven Spielberg and James Cameron holding the record on three occasions each. Spielberg became the first director to break his own record when *Jurassic Park* overtook *E.T.*, and Cameron emulated the feat when *Avatar* broke the record set by *Titanic*. When it took over the top spot in 2019, *Avengers: Endgame* became the first sequel to hold the record of highest-grossing film, and in doing so interrupted thirty-six years of Spielberg/Cameron dominance before *Avatar* reclaimed the top spot two years later in 2021 upon a re-release.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBecause of release schedules—especially in the case of films released towards the end of the year—and different release patterns across the world, many films can do business in two or more calendar years; therefore the grosses documented here are not confined to just the year of release. Grosses are not limited to original theatrical runs either, with many older films often being re-released periodically so the figures represent all the business a film has done since its original release; a film's first-run gross is included in brackets after the total if known. Because of incomplete data it cannot be known for sure how much money some films have made and when they made it, but generally the chart chronicles the films from each year that went on to earn the most. In the cases where estimates conflict both films are recorded, and in cases where a film has moved into first place because of being re-released the previous record-holder is also retained.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n† *Background shading indicates that at least one film in the series is playing in the week commencing 7 June 2024 in theaters around the world*.\n\n\n\n**Highest-grossing franchises and film series**[§]\n\n(The films in each franchise can be viewed by selecting \"show\".)\n| \n\n| Rank\n | Series\n | Total worldwide gross\n | No. of films\n | Average of films\n | Highest-grossing film\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | Marvel Cinematic Universe*S †* | $29,782,530,744\n | 33\n | $902,500,932\n | *Avengers: Endgame* ($2,797,501,328)\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | The Infinity Saga | $22,587,759,303\n | 23\n | $982,076,491\n | *Avengers: Endgame* ($2,797,501,328)\n |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | *Lightyear* (2022) | $226,425,420\n |  |\n\n |\n\n |\n\n\nSShared universes for which some properties also have their own entries.\n\n\n\\*Canada and U.S. gross only.\n\n\nRDistributor rental.\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Film portal\n\n\n* Lists of highest-grossing films\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Prior to the release of *Spectre* in 2015, the James Bond series had grossed approximately $17.7 billion at 2015 prices;[111] after factoring in earnings of over $1.6 billion from *Spectre* and *No Time to Die*, the series has earned at least $19.3 billion adjusted for inflation.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n25. **^** Gray, Brandon. \"'Avatar' Claims Highest Gross of All Time\". *Box Office Mojo*.
