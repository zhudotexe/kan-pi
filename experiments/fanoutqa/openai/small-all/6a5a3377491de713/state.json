It was later pointed out that portions of the score and the main theme were composed by Rota for his score to the 1958 Italian film, *Fortunella.* The Music Branch was given this information and re-balloted to determine the fifth nomination. The list of six films they were to choose from were the remaining five of the top ten preliminary listings, plus The Godfather score. The results of the re-balloting was that the fifth nomination became Sleuth, composed by John Addison.\n5. **^** *A Christmas Carol* was a 1971 television special that was later released as a short film in 1972. (The Academy has since changed its rules to prevent this.)\n6. **^** *Limelight*, a 1952 film, won its Oscar in 1972 because the blacklisting of Charlie Chaplin prevented it from being shown in Los Angeles until then. (The Academy subsequently changed its rules to prevent films more than two years old from receiving awards.)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| *The Theory of Everything* | 2014 | 1 | 5\n |\n| *Ida* | 2014 | 1 | 2\n |\n| *Selma* | 2014 | 1 | 2\n |\n| *Citizenfour* | 2014 | 1 | 1\n |\n| *Big Hero 6* | 2014 | 1 | 1\n |\n| *Crisis Hotline: Veterans Press 1* | 2014 | 1 | 1\n |\n| *The Phone Call* | 2014 | 1 | 1\n |\n| *Still Alice* | 2014 | 1 | 1\n |\n| *Feast* | 2014 | 1 | 1\n |\n| ***12 Years a Slave*** | 2013 | 3 | 9\n |\n| *Gravity* | 2013 | 7 | 10\n |\n| *Dallas Buyers Club* | 2013 | 3 | 6\n |\n| *Frozen* | 2013 | 2 | 2\n |\n| *The Great Gatsby* | 2013 | 2 | 2\n |\n| *Her* | 2013 | 1 | 5\n |\n| *Blue Jasmine* | 2013 | 1 | 3\n |\n| *Mr Hublot* | 2013 | 1 | 1\n |\n| *The Lady in Number 6* | 2013 | 1 | 1\n |\n| *Helium* | 2013 | 1 | 1\n |\n| *The Great Beauty* | 2013 | 1 | 1\n |\n| *20 Feet from Stardom* | 2013 | 1 | 1\n |\n| ***Argo*** | 2012 | 3 | 7\n |\n| *Life of Pi* | 2012 | 4 | 11\n |\n| *Les Mis\u00e9rables* | 2012 | 3 | 8\n |\n| *Lincoln* | 2012 | 2 | 12\n |\n| *Django Unchained* | 2012 | 2 | 5\n |\n| *Skyfall* | 2012 | 2 | 5\n |\n| *Silver Linings Playbook* | 2012 | 1 | 8\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| *Toy Story* | 1995 | 0 (1) | 3\n |\n| ***Forrest Gump*** | 1994 | 6 | 13\n |\n| *The Lion King* | 1994 | 2 | 4\n |\n| *Speed* | 1994 | 2 | 3\n |\n| *Ed Wood* | 1994 | 2 | 2\n |\n| *Pulp Fiction* | 1994 | 1 | 7\n |\n| *Bullets Over Broadway* | 1994 | 1 | 7\n |\n| *The Madness of King George* | 1994 | 1 | 4\n |\n| *Legends of the Fall* | 1994 | 1 | 3\n |\n| *A Time for Justice* | 1994 | 1 | 1\n |\n| *Franz Kafka's It's a Wonderful Life* | 1994 | 1 | 1\n |\n| *Maya Lin: A Strong Clear Vision* | 1994 | 1 | 1\n |\n| *Burnt by the Sun* (*Utomlyonnye solntsem*) | 1994 | 1 | 1\n |\n| *Trevor* | 1994 | 1 | 1\n |\n| *The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert* | 1994 | 1 | 1\n |\n| *Bob's Birthday* | 1994 | 1 | 1\n |\n| *Blue Sky* | 1994 | 1 | 1\n |\n| ***Schindler's List*** | 1993 | 7 | 12\n |\n| *The Piano* | 1993 | 3 | 8\n |\n| *Jurassic Park* | 1993 | 3 | 3\n |\n| *Philadelphia* | 1993 | 2 | 5\n |\n| *The Fugitive* | 1993 | 1 | 7\n |\n| *The Age of Innocence* | 1993 | 1 | 5\n |\n| *The Wrong Trousers* | 1993 | 1 | 1\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| *Belle Epoque* (*The Beautiful Era*) | 1993 | 1 | 1\n |\n| *I Am a Promise: The Children of Stanton Elementary School* | 1993 | 1 | 1\n |\n| *Mrs. Doubtfire* | 1993 | 1 | 1\n |\n| *Black Rider* (*Schwarzfahrer*) | 1993 | 1 | 1\n |\n| *Defending Our Lives* | 1993 | 1 | 1\n |\n| ***Unforgiven*** | 1992 | 4 | 9\n |\n| *Howards End* | 1992 | 3 | 9\n |\n| *Bram Stoker's Dracula* | 1992 | 3 | 4\n |\n| *Aladdin* | 1992 | 2 | 5\n |\n| *The Crying Game* | 1992 | 1 | 6\n |\n| *Scent of a Woman* | 1992 | 1 | 4\n |\n| *A River Runs Through It* | 1992 | 1 | 3\n |\n| *Indochine* | 1992 | 1 | 2\n |\n| *My Cousin Vinny* | 1992 | 1 | 1\n |\n| *The Panama Deception* | 1992 | 1 | 1\n |\n| *Educating Peter* | 1992 | 1 | 1\n |\n| *The Last of the Mohicans* | 1992 | 1 | 1\n |\n| *Death Becomes Her* | 1992 | 1 | 1\n |\n| *Omnibus* | 1992 | 1 | 1\n |\n| *Mona Lisa Descending a Staircase* | 1992 | 1 | 1\n |\n| ***The Silence of the Lambs*** | 1991 | 5 | 7\n |\n| *Terminator 2: Judgment Day* | 1991 | 4 | 6\n |\n| *Bugsy* | 1991 | 2 | 10\n |\n| *JFK* | 1991 | 2 | 8\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Tapley, Khristopher (October 29, 2017). \"Oscars: Alejandro G.
