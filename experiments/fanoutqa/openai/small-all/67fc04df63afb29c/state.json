First played in 1903,[1] the World Series championship is a best-of-seven playoff and is a contest between the champions of baseball's National League (NL) and American League (AL).[2] Often referred to as the \"Fall Classic\",[3] the modern World Series has been played every year since 1903 with two exceptions: in 1904, when the NL champion New York Giants declined to play the AL champion Boston Americans; and in 1994, when the series was canceled due to the players' strike.[1][2][4][5]The best-of-seven style has been the format of all World Series except in 1903, 1919, 1920, 1921, when the winner was determined through a best-of-nine playoff.[1][2] Although the large majority of contests have been played entirely during the month of October, a small number of Series have also had games played during September and November. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* 2014: San Francisco Giants\n* 2015: Kansas City Royals\n* 2016: Chicago Cubs\n* 2017: Houston Astros\n* 2018: Boston Red Sox\n* 2019: Washington Nationals\n |\n| 2020s | * 2020: Los Angeles Dodgers\n* 2021: Atlanta Braves\n* 2022: Houston Astros\n* 2023: Texas Rangers\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThis article is about winners of the World Series of Major League Baseball that began in 1903.
