First played in 1903,[1] the World Series championship is a best-of-seven playoff and is a contest between the champions of baseball's National League (NL) and American League (AL).[2] Often referred to as the \"Fall Classic\",[3] the modern World Series has been played every year since 1903 with two exceptions: in 1904, when the NL champion New York Giants declined to play the AL champion Boston Americans; and in 1994, when the series was canceled due to the players' strike.[1][2][4][5]The best-of-seven style has been the format of all World Series except in 1903, 1919, 1920, 1921, when the winner was determined through a best-of-nine playoff.[1][2] Although the large majority of contests have been played entirely during the month of October, a small number of Series have also had games played during September and November. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nWorld Series champions\n |\n| --- |\n| 1900s | * 1903: Boston Americans\n* 1904: *No series*\n* 1905: New York Giants\n* 1906: Chicago White Sox\n* 1907: Chicago Cubs\n* 1908: Chicago Cubs\n* 1909: Pittsburgh Pirates\n |\n| 1910s | * 1910: Philadelphia Athletics\n* 1911: Philadelphia Athletics\n* 1912: Boston Red Sox\n* 1913: Philadelphia Athletics\n* 1914: Boston Braves\n* 1915: Boston Red Sox\n* 1916: Boston Red Sox\n* 1917: Chicago White Sox\n* 1918: Boston Red Sox\n* 1919: Cincinnati Reds\n |\n| 1920s | * 1920: Cleveland Indians\n* 1921: New York Giants\n* 1922: New York Giants\n* 1923: New York Yankees\n* 1924: Washington Senators\n* 1925: Pittsburgh Pirates\n* 1926: St. Louis Cardinals\n* 1927: New York Yankees\n* 1928: New York Yankees\n* 1929: Philadelphia Athletics\n |\n| 1930s | * 1930: Philadelphia Athletics\n* 1931: St. Louis Cardinals\n* 1932: New York Yankees\n* 1933: New York Giants\n* 1934: St. Louis Cardinals\n* 1935: Detroit Tigers\n* 1936: New York Yankees\n* 1937: New York Yankees\n* 1938: New York Yankees\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 1962 | New York Yankees (27, 20–7) | 4–3 | San Francisco Giants (15, 5–10) | Alvin Dark |\n| 1963 | Los Angeles Dodgers (11, 3–8) | Walter Alston | 4–0 | New York Yankees (28, 20–8) | Ralph Houk |\n| 1964 | St. Louis Cardinals (10, 7–3) | Johnny Keane | 4–3 | New York Yankees (29, 20–9) | Yogi Berra |\n| 1965 | Los Angeles Dodgers (12, 4–8) | Walter Alston | 4–3 | Minnesota Twins (4, 1–3) | Sam Mele |\n| 1966 | Baltimore Orioles (2, 1–1) | Hank Bauer | 4–0 | Los Angeles Dodgers (13, 4–9) | Walter Alston |\n| Modern World Series Commissioner's Trophy (post-1967):[e] |\n| 1967 | St. Louis Cardinals (11, 8–3) | Red Schoendienst | 4–3 | Boston Red Sox (7, 5–2) | Dick Williams |\n| 1968 | Detroit Tigers (8, 3–5) | Mayo Smith | 4–3 | St. Louis Cardinals (12, 8–4) | Red Schoendienst |\n| 1969 | New York Mets (1, 1–0) | Gil Hodges | 4–1 | Baltimore Orioles (3, 1–2) | Earl Weaver |\n| 1970 | Baltimore Orioles (4, 2–2) | Earl Weaver | 4–1 | Cincinnati Reds (5, 2–3) | Sparky Anderson |\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_pf0swbulCpQ9iqxU4azuOXJK","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
