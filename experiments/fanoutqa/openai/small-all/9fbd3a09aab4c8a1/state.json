The ranking was based upon assets as reported and was not adjusted for different accounting treatments.[2] Another publication which has the goal to compile a yearly list of the world largest banks is The Banker Magazine. Every year in their July number a list of the World 1000 Largest Banks is published.[3] The financial data published by the July yearly issue of The Banker are much more extensive compared to the S&P Top 100 banks, but it's not a publication intended for the general public.\n\n\nAccounting treatment affects the assets reported: for example, the United States uses US GAAP (as opposed to IFRS), which only reports the net derivative position in most cases, leading to US banks having fewer derivative assets than comparable non-US banks.[4] If JPMorgan Chase reported under the IFRS, it would be ranked 2nd on the list as of 2023[update], rather than 5th.[2]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Rank\n | Bank name\n | Total assets(2022)(US$ billion)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | ![China](image) Industrial and

It is the largest bank in the United States and the world's largest bank by market capitalization as of 2023.[4][5] As the largest of Big Four banks, the firm is considered systemically important by the Financial Stability Board. Its size and scale have often led to enhanced regulatory oversight as well as the maintenance of an internal \"Fortress Balance Sheet\"[6][7] of capital reserves. The firm is headquartered at 383 Madison Avenue in Midtown Manhattan and is set to move into the under-construction JPMorgan Chase Building at 270 Park Avenue in 2025.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n169. **^** \"Annual Report 2020 (JPMorgan Chase & Co.

The firm operates the largest investment bank in the world by revenue.[9][10] It occupies 24th place on the Fortune 500 list of the largest U.S. corporations by revenue. It produces institutional research on financial markets, economics, geopolitics, and personal finance across its business lines. The company's balance sheet, geographic footprint, and thought leadership have yielded a substantial market share in banking and a high level of brand loyalty. Alternatively, it receives routine criticism for its risk management, broad financing activities, and large-scale legal settlements.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"in PDF on page 8 second table (Assets under management (\"AUM\"))\" (PDF). *www.jpmorganchase.com*.\n2. **^** \"J.P.

The present company was formed after the two predecessor firms merged in 2000, creating a diversified holding entity. It is a major provider of investment banking services, through corporate advisory, mergers and acquisitions, sales and trading, and public offerings.

The Bank of the Manhattan Company was the creation of Aaron Burr, who transformed the company from a water carrier into a bank.[14]\n\n\nAccording to page 115 of *An Empire of Wealth* by John Steele Gordon, the origin of this strand of JPMorgan Chase's history runs as follows:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn August 2013, JPMorgan Chase announced that it was being investigated by the United States Department of Justice over its offerings of mortgage-backed securities leading up to the financial crisis of 2007\u201308. The company said that the Department of Justice had preliminarily concluded that the firm violated federal securities laws in offerings of subprime and Alt-A residential mortgage securities during the period 2005 to 2007.[145] On November 19, 2013, the Justice Department announced that JPMorgan Chase agreed to pay $13 billion to settle investigations into its business practices pertaining to mortgage-backed securities.[146] Of that amount, $9 billion was penalties and fines, and the remaining $4 billion was consumer relief. This was the largest corporate settlement to date. Conduct at Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual prior to their 2008 acquisitions accounted for much of the alleged wrongdoing. The agreement did not settle criminal charges.[147]\n\n\n\n### 2014[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n94. **^** \"JPMorgan Backs Super Soccer League With $4.8 Billion\". *Bloomberg*.

It has been suggested that the deal was structured this way to prevent a potential bankruptcy stemming from large losses in Countrywide hurting the parent organization by keeping Countrywide bankruptcy remote.[55] Countrywide Financial has changed its name to Bank of America Home Loans.\n\n\nIn December 2011, the Justice Department announced a $335 million settlement with Bank of America over discriminatory lending practice at Countrywide Financial.

It was founded on 10 July 1951, and has its headquarters in Dongcheng District, Beijing.[4] It has branches throughout mainland China, Hong Kong, London, Tokyo, New York, Frankfurt, Sydney, Seoul, and Singapore.\n\n\nABC has 320 million retail customers, 2.7 million corporate clients, and nearly 24,000 branches. It is China's third-largest lender by assets. ABC went public in mid-2010, fetching the world's biggest ever initial public offering (IPO) at the time,[5] since overtaken by the Saudi Arabian state-run petroleum enterprise, Saudi Aramco.[6] In 2011, it ranked eighth among the Top 1000 World Banks,[7] by 2015, it ranked third in Forbes' 13th annual Global 2000 list[8] and in 2017 it ranked fifth.[9] It is considered a systemically important bank by the Financial Stability Board.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nSince the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, ABC has been formed and abolished several times. On July 10, 1951, two banks of the Republic of China, Farmers Bank of China and Cooperation Bank, merged to form the Agricultural Cooperation Bank, which ABC regards as its ancestor. However, the bank was merged into People's Bank of China, the central bank in 1952. The first bank bearing the name Agricultural Bank of China was founded in 1955, but it was merged into the central bank in 1957. In 1963 the Chinese government formed another agricultural bank which was also merged into the central bank two years later. Today's Agricultural Bank of China was founded in February 1979. As the People's Bank of China began spinning off its commercial banking functions after 1978, ABC's focus on providing farmers with financial services increased.[10]:\u200a225\n\n\nABC was restructured to form a holding company called Agricultural Bank of China Limited.[11] It was listed on the Shanghai and Hong Kong stock exchanges in July 2010.[12]\n\n\nIn April 2007, ABC was the victim of the largest bank theft in Chinese history. This occurred when two vault managers at the Handan branch of the bank in Hebei province embezzled almost 51 million yuan (US$7.5 million).[13]\n\n\nIn 2012, ABC started a project to migrate to the Avaloq Banking System.[14][15]\n\n\nDuring the 2013 Korean crisis, the Agricultural Bank of China halted business with a North Korean bank accused by the United States of financing Pyongyang's missile and nuclear programs.[16]\n\n\n\n## 2010 initial public offering[edit]\n\n\nABC was the last of the \"big four\" banks in China to go public. In 2010, A shares and H shares of Agricultural Bank of China were listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange respectively. Each share was set to cost between 2.7RMB and 3.3RMB per share.[17] H shares were set to cost between HK$2.88 and HK$3.48 per share.[18] The final share price for the IPO launch was issued on July 7, 2010. On completion in August 2010 it became the world's biggest initial public offering (IPO) surpassing the one set by Industrial and Commercial Bank of China in 2006 of US$21.9 billion.[19] This record has since been beaten by another Chinese company, Alibaba, in 2014.[20]\n\n\nABC raised US$19.21 billion in an IPO in Hong Kong and Shanghai on July 6, 2010, before overallotment options were exercised.[21] On August 13, 2010, ABC officially completed the world's largest initial public offering, raising a total of $22.1 billion after both Shanghai and Hong Kong's over-allotments were fully exercised.[22][23] The IPO was once thought to be able to raise US$30 billion, but weaker market sentiment dampened the value.[24] Despite a 15-month low for the Chinese benchmark index, the IPO was said to have gone smoothly.[25]\n\n\nCICC, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley led the Hong Kong offering, with JPMorgan, Macquarie, Deutsche Bank and ABC's own securities unit also involved. CICC, CITIC Securities, Galaxy and Guotai Junan Securities handled the Shanghai portion. ABC sold about 40% of the Shanghai offering to 27 strategic investors, including China Life Insurance and China State Construction. They were subject to lock-up periods of 12\u201318 months. Eleven cornerstone investors were selected for its Hong Kong share offering, including Qatar Investment Authority and Kuwait Investment Authority, taking a combined $5.45 billion worth of shares.[26]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Companies portal\n* ![icon](image)Banks portal\n\n\n* Asset management in China\n* Banking in China\n\t+ Policy banks\n\t+ List of banks in China\n* List of companies of China\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** \"Annual Report 2018\".
