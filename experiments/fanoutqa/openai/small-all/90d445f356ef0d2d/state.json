Its cast includes Lee Jung-jae, Park Hae-soo, Wi Ha-joon, HoYeon Jung, O Yeong-su, Heo Sung-tae, Anupam Tripathi and Kim Joo-ryoung.\n\n\nThe series revolves around a secret contest where 456 players, all of whom are in deep financial hardship, risk their lives to play a series of deadly children's games for the chance to win a \u20a945.6 billion prize. The series' title draws from a similarly named Korean children's game. Hwang conceived the idea based on his own economic struggles, as well as the class disparity in South Korea and capitalism. Though he wrote the story in 2009, Hwang couldn't find a production company to fund the idea until Netflix took an interest around 2019 as part of a drive to expand their foreign programming offerings.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAs of November 5, 2021, the song has over 9.6 million views on *Saturday Night Live*'s YouTube channel.[164][165] In November 2021, American YouTuber Jimmy Donaldson aka MrBeast recreated *Squid Game* in real life with 456 people competing in similar but non-lethal games as the show for a $456,000 cash prize.[166] The video drew more than 303.5 million views as of November 15, 2022, making it one of the most-watched YouTube videos of 2021.[167] Series creator Hwang has reacted positively to the recreations and parodies.[168] Google reported that *Squid Game* was the most-searched television show on search engine in 2021,[169] while Twitter said that *Squid Game* was the most-tweeted about television show of 2021.[170]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNetflix claimed that *Squid Game* had \"pierced the cultural zeitgeist\" and became a popular Internet meme, with over 42 billion views of videos related to *Squid Game* in the first month after broadcast.[125] Analytics firm Vobile stated that by November 2021, *Squid Game*-related videos on YouTube totaled over 17 billion views, surpassing *Game of Thrones* in the same metric.[163] On October 16, 2021, an episode of the American late-night live television sketch comedy and variety show *Saturday Night Live*, featuring guest host Rami Malek and cast member Pete Davidson, parodied *Squid Game* by singing a country song about the series. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n38. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** Frater, Patrick (September 24, 2021). \"'Squid Game' Director Hwang Dong-hyuk on Netflix's Hit Korean Series and Prospects for a Sequel\". *Variety*.

Kim stated that there was \"so much more than what was written in the 120-minute format. So we worked together to turn it into a series.\"[42] Hwang said he was able to expand the script so that it \"could focus on the relationships between people [and] the stories that each of the people had\".[44] Initially, Netflix had named the series *Round Six*, rather than *Squid Game* as Hwang had suggested; according to Netflix's vice president for content in Asia Kim Minyoung, while they knew that the name \"squid game\" would be familiar to Korean viewers from the children's game, it \"wouldn't resonate because not many people would get it\", and opted to use *Round Six* as it self-described the nature of the competition. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n*Squid Game* remained the most-watched show on Netflix based on the first 28 days of viewing, ahead of *Stranger Things 4*.[129][130]\n\n\nOutside of Asian regions, the show's popularity was driven primarily through word of mouth and viral spread on social media. *Vulture* also claimed that the show's widespread localization, with subtitles in 37 languages and dubbed versions in 34 languages, helped to capture an international audience.[41] Hwang believed that the show's popularity was due to \"the irony that hopeless grownups risk their lives to win a kids' game\", as well as the familiarity and simplicity of the games that allowed the show to focus on characterization.[131] The diversity of the characters that play the Squid Game, drawing from different walks of lower- and middle-class life, also helps draw audiences to watch as many could find sympathy in one or more of the characters.[131]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Squid Game: the smash-hit South Korean horror is a perfect fit for our dystopian mood\". *the Guardian*.

According to Symphony, within the first 35 days of release, *Stranger Things* averaged ratings of around 14.07\u00a0million adults between the ages of 18 and 49 in the United States. This made it the third most-watched season of Netflix original content in the U.S. at the time behind the first season of *Fuller House* and fourth season of *Orange Is the New Black*.[100] In a September 2016 analysis, Netflix found that *Stranger Things* \"hooked\" viewers by the second episode of the first season, indicating that the second episode was \"the first installment that led at least 70 percent of viewers who watched that episode to complete the entire first season of a show.\"[101]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n63. **^** Bankhurst, Adam (November 6, 2019). \"Stranger Things: Title Revealed for Fourth Season's First Episode\". *IGN*.

The nearby Hawkins National Laboratory ostensibly performs scientific research for the United States Department of Energy but secretly experiments with the paranormal and supernatural, sometimes with human test subjects. They have inadvertently created a portal to an alternate dimension they refer to as the Upside Down, whose presence begins to affect the residents of Hawkins in calamitous ways.[5][6]\n\n\nThe first season begins in November 1983. Will Byers is abducted by a creature from the Upside Down. His mother, Joyce; the town's police chief, Jim Hopper; and a group of volunteers search for him. A young psychokinetic girl named Eleven escapes from the laboratory and is found by friends of Will. Eleven befriends and assists them in their efforts to find Will.[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n6. **^** \"Netflix to premiere original series *Montauk* in 2016\". *Reuters*. April 2, 2015.

According to international standard ISO 8601, it is the third day of the week. In countries which have Friday as their holiday, Wednesday is the fifth day of the week. In countries which use the Sunday-first convention, and in both the Islamic and Jewish calendars, Wednesday is the fourth day of the week.\n\n\nIn English, the name is derived from Old English *W\u014ddnesd\u00e6g* and Middle English *Wednesdei*, 'day of Woden', reflecting the religion practiced by the Anglo-Saxons, the English equivalent to the Norse god Odin. In many Romance languages, such as the French *mercredi*, Spanish *mi\u00e9rcoles* or Italian *mercoled\u00ec*, the day's name is a calque of Latin *dies Mercurii* 'day of Mercury'.\n\n\nWednesday is in the middle of the common Western five-day workweek that starts on Monday and finishes on Friday.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\n*See Names of the days of the week for more on naming conventions.*\nThe name Wednesday continues Middle English *Wednesdei*. Old English still had *w\u014ddnesd\u00e6g*, which would be continued as *\\*Wodnesday* (but Old Frisian has an attested *wednesdei*). By the early 13th century, the *i*-mutated form was introduced unetymologically.[*clarification needed*]\n\n\nThe name is a calque of the Latin *dies Mercurii* 'day of Mercury', reflecting the fact that the Germanic god Woden (Wodanaz or Odin) during the Roman era was interpreted as \"Germanic Mercury\".\n\n\nThe Latin name dates to the late 2nd or early 3rd century. It is a calque of Greek \u1f21\u03bc\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1 \u1f1d\u03c1\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5 (*hem\u00e9ra H\u00e9rmou*), a term first attested, together with the system of naming the seven weekdays after the seven classical planets, in the *Anthologiarum* by Vettius Valens (c. AD 170).\n\n\nThe Latin name is reflected directly in the weekday name in most modern Romance languages: *m\u00e9rcuris* (Sardinian), *mercredi* (French), *mercoled\u00ec* (Italian), *mi\u00e9rcoles* (Spanish), *miercuri* (Romanian), *dimecres* (Catalan), *marcuri* or *mercuri* (Corsican), *m\u00e8rcore* (Venetian). In Welsh it is *Dydd Mercher*, meaning 'Mercury's Day'.\n\n\nThe Dutch name for the day, *woensdag*, has the same etymology as English *Wednesday*; it comes from Middle Dutch *wodenesdag*, *woedensdag* ('Wodan's day').\n\n\nThe German name for the day, *Mittwoch* (literally: 'mid-week'), replaced the former name *Wodenstag* ('Wodan's day') in the 10th century. (Similarly, the Yiddish word for Wednesday is \u05de\u05d9\u05d8\u05d5\u05d5\u05d0\u05da (*mitvokh*), meaning and sounding a lot like the German word it came from.)\n\n\nMost Slavic languages follow this pattern and use derivations of 'the middle' (Belarusian \u0441\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0430 *serada*, Bulgarian \u0441\u0440\u044f\u0434\u0430 *sryada*, Croatian *srijeda*, Czech *st\u0159eda*, Macedonian \u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0430 *sreda*, Polish *\u015broda*, Russian \u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0430 *sred\u00e1*, Serbian \u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0430 *sreda* or c\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0435\u0434\u0430 *srijeda*, Slovak *streda*, Slovene *sreda*, Ukrainian \u0441\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0430 *sereda*). \nThe Finnish name is *keskiviikko* ('middle of the week'), as is the Icelandic name: *mi\u00f0vikudagur*, and the Faroese name: *mikudagur* ('mid-week day'). Some dialects of Faroese have *\u00f3nsdagur*, though, which shares etymology with Wednesday. Danish, Norwegian, Swedish *onsdag*, (*Ons-dag* meaning *Odens dag* 'Odin's day').\n\n\nIn Japanese, the word for Wednesday is \u6c34\u66dc\u65e5 (*sui youbi*) meaning 'water day' and is associated with \u6c34\u661f (*suisei*): Mercury (the planet), literally meaning 'water star'. Similarly, in Korean the word for Wednesday is \uc218\uc694\uc77c; *su yo il*, also meaning 'water day'.\n\n\nIn most of the languages of India, the word for Wednesday is *Budhav\u0101ra* \u2014 *v\u0101ra* meaning 'day' and *Budha* being the planet Mercury.\n\n\nIn Armenian (\u0549\u0578\u0580\u0565\u0584\u0577\u0561\u0562\u0569\u056b *chorekshabti*), Georgian (\u10dd\u10d7\u10ee\u10e8\u10d0\u10d1\u10d0\u10d7\u10d8 *otkhshabati*), Turkish (*\u00e7ar\u015famba*), and Tajik (*chorshanbiyev*) languages the word literally means 'four (days) from Saturday' originating from Persian (\u0686\u0647\u0627\u0631\u0634\u0646\u0628\u0647 *cheharshanbeh*).\n\n\nPortuguese uses the word *quarta-feira*, meaning 'fourth day', while in Greek the word is *Tetarti* (\u03a4\u03b5\u03c4\u03ac\u03c1\u03c4\u03b7) meaning simply 'fourth'. Similarly, Arabic \u0623\u0631\u0628\u0639\u0627\u0621 means 'fourth', Hebrew \u05e8\u05d1\u05d9\u05e2\u05d9 means 'fourth', and Persian \u0686\u0647\u0627\u0631\u0634\u0646\u0628\u0647 means 'fourth day'. Yet the name for the day in Estonian *kolmap\u00e4ev*, Lithuanian *tre\u010diadienis*, and Latvian *tre\u0161diena* means 'third day' while in Mandarin Chinese \u661f\u671f\u4e09 (*x\u012bngq\u012bs\u0101n*), means 'day three', as Sunday is unnumbered.\n\n\n\n## Religious observances[edit]\n\n\n![A priest marks a cross of ashes on a worshipper's forehead.](image)The imposition of ashes on Ash Wednesday\nThe Creation narrative in the Hebrew Bible places the creation of the Sun and Moon on \"the fourth day\" of the divine workweek.\n\n\nQuakers traditionally referred to Wednesday as \"Fourth Day\" to avoid the pagan associations with the name \"Wednesday\",[1] or in keeping with the practice of treating each day as equally divine.\n\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church observes Wednesday (as well as Friday) as a fast day throughout the year (with the exception of several fast-free periods during the year). Fasting on Wednesday and Fridays entails abstinence from meat or meat products (i.e., four-footed animals), poultry and dairy products. Unless a feast day occurs on a Wednesday, the Orthodox also abstain from fish, from using oil in their cooking and from alcoholic beverages (there is some debate over whether abstention from oil involves all cooking oil or only olive oil). For the Orthodox, Wednesdays and Fridays throughout the year commemorate the betrayal of Jesus (Wednesday) and the Crucifixion of Christ (Friday). There are hymns in the Octoekhos which reflect this liturgically. These include special *Theotokia* (hymns to the Mother of God) called *Stavrotheotokia* ('Cross-Theotokia'). The dismissal at the end of services on Wednesday begins with these words: \"May Christ our true God, through the power of the precious and life-giving cross....\"\n\n\nIn Irish and Scottish Gaelic, the name for Wednesday also refers to fasting, as it is *D\u00e9 C\u00e9adaoin* in Irish Gaelic and *Di-Ciadain* in Scottish Gaelic, which comes from **ch\u00e9ad**, meaning 'first', and **aoine**, meaning 'fasting', which combined means 'first day of fasting'.[2]\n\n\nIn American culture many Catholic and Protestant churches schedule study or prayer meetings on Wednesday nights. The sports calendar in many American public schools reflects this, reserving Mondays and Thursdays for girls' games and Tuesdays and Fridays for boys' games while generally avoiding events on Wednesday evening.\n\n\nIn the Catholic devotion of the Holy Rosary, the glorious mysteries are meditated on Wednesday and also Sunday throughout the year.\n\n\nWednesday is the day of the week devoted by the Catholic tradition to Saint Joseph.\n\n\nIn Hinduism, Budha is the god of Mercury (planet), Wednesday, and of merchants and merchandise. Krishna, Vithoba, and Ganesha are also worshipped on Wednesday.\n\n\n\n## Cultural usage[edit]\n\n\nAccording to the Thai solar calendar, the color given with Wednesday is green.[3]\n\n\nIn the folk rhyme Monday's Child, \"Wednesday's child is full of woe\". In the rhyme Solomon Grundy, Grundy was \"married on Wednesday\". In *Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day*, the disagreeable nature of the weather is attributed to it being \"Winds-Day\" (a play on *Wednesday*). In Richard Brautigan's *In Watermelon Sugar* Wednesday is the day when the sun shines grey.[*full citation needed*] Wednesday Friday Addams is a member of the fictional family The Addams Family. Her name is derived from the idea that Wednesday's child is full of woe. Additionally, Wednesday sometimes appears as a character's name in literary works. These include *Thursday's fictions* by Richard James Allen, Wednesday Next from the Thursday Next series by Jasper Fforde and Neil Gaiman's novel *American Gods*. In the 1945 John Steinbeck novel *Sweet Thursday*, the titular day is preceded by \"Lousy Wednesday\".\n\n\nWednesday is sometimes informally referred to as \"**hump day**\" in North America, a reference to the fact that Wednesday is the middle day\u2014or \"hump\"\u2014of a typical work week.[4][5] *Lill\u00f6rdag*, or \"little Saturday\", is a Nordic tradition of turning Wednesday evening into a small weekend-like celebration.[6] Humpday is also a name of a 2009 film.\n\n\nIn Poland Wednesday night is often referred by young people as \"time of vodka\", after song by Bartosz Walaszek \"\u015arodowa noc to w\u00f3dy czas\"\n\n\n\n## Astrology[edit]\n\n\nThe astrological sign of the planet Mercury, **\u263f**, represents Wednesday\u2014*dies Mercurii* to the Romans, it had similar names in Latin-derived languages, such as the Italian *mercoled\u00ec* (*d\u00ec* means 'day'), the French *mercredi*, and the Spanish *mi\u00e9rcoles*. In English, this became \"Woden's Day\", since the Roman god Mercury was identified by Woden in Northern Europe and it is especially aligned by the astrological signs of Gemini and Virgo.\n\n\n\n## Named days[edit]\n\n\n* Ash Wednesday, the first day of Lent in the Western Christian tradition, occurs forty-six days before Easter (forty, not counting Sundays).\n* Black Wednesday, the day of a financial crisis in the United Kingdom\n* Holy Wednesday, sometimes called Spy Wednesday in allusion to the betrayal of Jesus by Judas Iscariot, is the Wednesday immediately preceding Easter.\n* Red Wednesday, the Yezidi festival celebrated in Iraq[7]\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Guide to Quaker Calendar Names\".

In 1991, an adult Dahmer buys alcohol for 14-year old Konerak Sinthasomphone and brings him to his apartment under the guise of paying the teen for lewd photographs. Dahmer drugs the teen, then experiments by using a power drill to drill into the boy's skull. While Dahmer goes out to buy more alcohol, a woozy Konerak awakes and tries to escape but only makes it to the stairwell where Glenda and her daughter find him. Glenda is concerned about the boy's age, and calls police, but the police take Dahmer's word that the boy is an adult who is Dahmer's boyfriend and simply drank too much. The police escort Konerak back inside, and Dahmer kills him after they leave. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| As a high school senior in 1977\u201378, Dahmer continues to show interest in animal dissection while also becoming fully aware of his sexual preference for men. After his father and mother divorce, Lionel moves in with his new girlfriend Shari and soon after Joyce moves away with Jeffrey's younger brother David. Jeffrey is left alone in the house to fend for himself. He begins drinking heavily, lifting weights, and fantasizing about having a male companion in the house. He later picks up a hitchhiker named Steven Hicks and invites him to drink beer and work out. When Steven rejects Dahmer's sexual advance and uses a gay slur, Dahmer hits him with a barbell and then strangles him to death. Two police officers stop him when they see his car swerving, but let him off with a warning despite seeing several garbage bags in the car's back seat. Dahmer destroys Hicks' bones and scatters the ashes on the family property.\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| After Dahmer is arrested and news of his victims becomes public, there is widespread outrage with police among the victims' families, and particularly with Glenda Cleveland. She is most upset over the murder of Konerak (whom she tried to help before police returned him to Dahmer's apartment) and has been severely traumatized by listening to the noises (screams and power tools) coming from Dahmer's apartment. Dahmer's building is considered hazardous due to the chemicals he used to dissolve body parts. The tenants are evacuated, forcing Glenda to get a motel room. Jesse Jackson takes an interest in the case due to the large number of black and brown victims, and he meets with Glenda, who tells him of the horrors she witnessed, including a time when an angry Dahmer served her a sandwich made with possible human remains. Disgusted, Jackson vows to hold the Milwaukee Police accountable for their oversights.\n |\n| 8 | 8 | \"Lionel\" | Gregg Araki | Ian Brennan & David McMillan | September\u00a021,\u00a02022\u00a0(2022-09-21) |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAccolades received by *Dahmer \u2013 Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story*\n| Award\n | Date of ceremony\n | Category\n | Recipient(s)\n | Result\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hollywood Music in Media Awards | November 16, 2022\n | Best Music Supervision \u2013 Television | Amanda Krieg Thomas\n | Nominated\n | [29] |\n| People's Choice Awards | December 6, 2022 | The Bingeworthy Show of 2022\n | *Dahmer \u2013 Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story* | Won\n | [30] |\n| Golden Globe Awards | January 10, 2023 | Best Limited or Anthology Series or Television Film | *Dahmer \u2013 Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story* | Nominated\n | [31] |\n| Best Actor \u2013 Limited Series, Anthology Series or Television Motion Picture | Evan Peters | Won\n |\n| Best Supporting Actress \u2013 Television Limited Series/Motion Picture | Niecy Nash | Nominated\n |\n| Best Supporting Actor \u2013 Television Limited Series/Motion Picture | Richard Jenkins | Nominated\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| In 1987, Dahmer takes a job at a chocolate factory. He begins to seek out victims with the conscious intention of killing, beginning a cycle of bringing men to Catherine's house, drugging them, strangling them to death, and dismembering them in the cellar. The smells coming from the cellar prompt a confrontation with Catherine and Lionel. When Dahmer tells them that it is caused by his taxidermy hobby, Lionel excoriates him for not cleaning up after it adequately, leading Dahmer to reassure them that he will cease that activity. Dahmer invites Ronald Flowers Jr., a man struggling with his car, to Catherine's house in an attempt to drug and kill him. After Flowers falls unconscious in her living room, Catherine finds him and forces Jeffrey to put him on a bus. After Flowers reports this to the police, they question Dahmer and Catherine, but find no evidence to arrest him. Dahmer is later arrested after another victim, Somsack Sinthasomphone, Konerak's older brother, escapes from him. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Lionel and Shari return to the Dahmer residence after three months, surprised to hear Joyce moved out, and discovers Jeff's drinking. Jeff attempts to talk to his father about his homicidal thoughts, but is interrupted by Lionel planning to send him to Ohio State University. At OSU, Dahmer is expelled for attendance issues, causing his father to enlist him in the Army in another attempt to get his son's life on track. In 1981, Dahmer is honorably discharged due to alcohol abuse. Lionel sends him to live with his grandmother, Catherine. At her suggestion, Dahmer goes to a state fair, where he gets drunk and is arrested for indecent exposure. He takes a job as a phlebotomist, where he steals blood bags and drinks from them. Dahmer later begins going to a gay bathhouse, but is soon banned for spiking drinks. In 1987, Dahmer accidentally drugs himself in a hotel room with another man, then wakes up the next morning to discover he had murdered him. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Penelope Ann Miller as Joyce Dahmer (n\u00e9e Flint), Jeffrey's mother and Lionel's first wife\n\t+ Savannah Brown plays a younger version of Joyce Dahmer\n* Dia Nash as Sandra Smith, Glenda\u2019s daughter\n* Nigel Gibbs as Rev.

He lands a job in Madison, but returns to spend time with his family in Milwaukee on weekends. One weekend evening, he dances at a bar and catches Dahmer's eye. Dahmer thinks about spiking Tony's drink at the bar, but reconsiders. Tony and Dahmer say they like each other, and they meet again the following weekend. Dahmer invites Tony into his apartment, where he again considers drugging him but resists. The two sleep together, and the following morning Tony says he has to leave for work. Dahmer gets a hammer, but lets Tony go. However, when Tony returns for his keys, Dahmer kills him with the hammer. Tony's mother, Shirley contacts police when her son has not checked in and missed work. They seemingly do nothing, so she posts \"Missing Person\" signs all over Milwaukee. As she does, she notices many other such signs near the gay bars. After killing Tony, Dahmer prepares a piece of meat, likely human flesh, cooks it and eats it.\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn September 23, 2022, Netflix removed the series' \"LGBTQ\" tag after backlash on social media.[45][46]\n\n\nThe series also received backlash from the families of Dahmer's victims, accusing Netflix of profiting off their traumatic experiences and \"retraumatizing [the families] all over again\".

After convincing Shirley to sue Lionel Dahmer over the profits of his book, lawyer Joe Zilber brings a $14 million lawsuit against the City of Milwaukee on behalf of the victims' families. Lionel learns that any profits from his book will be paid to victims' families.

The $14 million lawsuit is settled out of court for less than $900,000. Joe Zilber, angered that people plan to profit by selling items removed from Dahmer's home, offers the dealers double their asking price. He then gives every victim's family a share of what he paid, saying all the items will be destroyed. An inmate named Christopher Scarver kills Dahmer and another inmate, Jesse Anderson, with a metal bar, saying that God told him to commit the murder. Per Dahmer's wishes, his body is cremated, and no funeral is held, but his brain is kept for scientific research. Lionel insists that the brain also be destroyed, while Joyce wants it to be studied. Lionel explains that he and the victims' families just want closure, which would be made more difficult by retaining the brain. A judge sides with Lionel, and the brain is cremated. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAs Milwaukee residents watch, the Oxford Apartments are destroyed. Glenda meets with a city official to advocate for the site of the apartments to be turned into a memorial for the victims, but is warned that it will be a lengthy process.
