Instead, they recommended exploring future pay increases with additional condition that council members voting for pay increases not be allowed to benefit from the increase. This recommendation was approved by the city council in a 5–3 vote in favor of the changes.[19] In November 2018, voters passed Measure L which ties future mayoral salaries to those of Superior Court judges.[21] As of December 2020, the mayoral salary is $206,000.[22]\n\n\n\n## Election and succession[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHead of the executive branch of the San Diego city government\n\nFor Mayors of San Diego prior to 1850, see List of pre-statehood mayors of San Diego.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Mayor of the City of San Diego |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)Seal of San Diego\n |\n| ![](image)Flag of San Diego\n |\n| ![](image)\n**IncumbentTodd Gloria**since December 10, 2020\n |\n| Term length | Four years, renewable once |\n| Inaugural holder | Joshua Bean |\n| Formation | 1850 |\n| Salary | $206,000 annually |\n| Website | Office of the Mayor |\n\n\nThe **mayor of the City of San Diego** is the official head and chief executive officer of the U.S. city of San Diego, California.

However, the city went bankrupt in 1852, only two years after incorporation. As a result of the bankruptcy, the State of California dissolved the government and replaced the mayor and city council with a board of trustees.[1] The mayoral position was later re-established with a new charter in 1887.[2] This charter was replaced with a permanent City Charter on May 6, 1889, using the strong mayor form of government.\n\n\nIn 1931, a new charter was adopted using a council–manager government with a citywide mayor as leader of the city council.\n\n\nIn November 2004, voters approved Proposition F, returning San Diego to the strong mayor form of government on a five-year trial basis. This was made permanent in June 2010 with the passage of Proposition D.[3]\n\n\n\n### Scandals[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIf the office of the mayor becomes vacant with one year or less remaining in the term, the city council appoints a person to fill the vacancy. If the vacancy occurs with more than one year remaining, the city council is obligated to call a special election. The candidate with the majority of the votes in the special election is declared mayor. If no candidate receives a majority, a special run-off must be held between the two candidates with the highest number of votes. While the mayor's office is vacant pending a special election, the president of the city council serves as the interim mayor, with limited powers, until a new mayor is elected.[24] If for any reason a Mayor serves a partial term of two years or more, it will count as one full term.[18]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n28. **^** \"William Jefferson Hunsaker (1855-1933)\". *Biographies*.

The mayor also has the authority to dismiss the chief of police or the chief of the fire department subject to a council overrule. The mayor may recommend measures and ordinance to the city council, but may not vote on these items.\n\n\nOn or before January 15, the mayor is obligated to communicate a State of the City address to the city council. The mayor must also propose a budget to the city council and for public review no later than April 15.[18]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nElections in California\n |\n| --- |\n| * Propositions\n\t+ List\n\t\t- 1970–1979\n\t\t- 1980–1989\n\t\t- 1990–1999\n\t\t- 2000–2009\n\t\t- 2010–2019\n\t\t- 2020–2029\n |\n| General | * 1992\n* 1994\n* 1996\n* 1998\n* 2000\n* 2002\n* 2004\n* 2005\n* 2006\n* 2008\n\t+ Feb\n\t+ Jun\n\t+ Nov\n* 2009\n* 2010\n\t+ Jun\n\t+ Nov\n* 2012\n\t+ Jun\n\t+ Nov\n* 2014\n* 2016\n* 2018\n* 2020\n* 2022\n* 2024\n |\n| Governor | * 1849\n* 1851\n* 1853\n* 1855\n* 1857\n* 1859\n* 1861\n* 1863\n* 1867\n* 1871\n* 1875\n* 1879\n* 1882\n* 1886\n* 1890\n* 1894\n* 1898\n* 1902\n* 1906\n* 1910\n* 1914\n* 1918\n* 1922\n* 1926\n* 1930\n* 1934\n* 1938\n* 1942\n* 1946\n* 1950\n* 1954\n* 1958\n* 1962\n* 1966\n* 1970\n* 1974\n* 1978\n* 1982\n* 1986\n* 1990\n* 1994\n* 1998\n* 2002\n* 2003 (recall)\n* 2006\n* 2010\n* 2014\n* 2018\n* 2021 (recall)\n* 2022\n* 2026\n |\n| Lieutenant Governor | * 1950\n* 1954\n* 1958\n* 1962\n* 1966\n* 1970\n* 1974\n* 1978\n* 1982\n* 1986\n* 1990\n* 1994\n* 1998\n* 2002\n* 2006\n* 2010\n* 2014\n* 2018\n* 2022\n |\n| Mayoral | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn July 2013, three former supporters of mayor Bob Filner asked him to resign because of allegations of repeated sexual harassment.[14] Over the ensuing six weeks, 18 women came forward to publicly claim that Filner had sexually harassed them,[15] and multiple individuals and groups called for him to resign. Filner agreed to resign effective August 30, 2013, subsequently pleaded guilty to one felony count of false imprisonment and two misdemeanor battery charges, and was sentenced to house arrest and probation.[16][17]\n\n\n\n## Duties and powers[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter San Diego's bankruptcy in 1852, the State of California took over city government and ran the city with an appointed Board of Trustees during 1852–1888. The President of the Board was called *mayor* by courtesy, although there was no official office of mayor.[1] When the office of president was vacated due to death or resignation, the board of trustees would choose a president pro tempore to preside over meetings until a permanent president could be elected by the board.[26][27]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThis list includes people who served as acting mayor or interim mayor due to a vacancy in the office of the mayor, but who were not officially elected or appointed as mayor.

Inzunza was sentenced to 21 months in prison.[11] In 2009, a judge acquitted Zucchet on seven out of the nine counts against him, and granted his petition for a new trial on the other two charges;[12] the remaining charges were eventually dropped.[13]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Los Angeles | * 1896\n* 1898\n* 1900\n* 1902\n* 1904\n* 1906\n* 1909\n\t+ Mar\n\t+ Nov\n* 1911\n* 1913\n* 1915\n* 1917\n* 1919\n* 1921\n* 1925\n* 1929\n* 1933\n* 1937\n* 1941\n* 1945\n* 1949\n* 1953\n* 1957\n* 1961\n* 1965\n* 1969\n* 1973\n* 1977\n* 1981\n* 1985\n* 1989\n* 1993\n* 1997\n* 2001\n* 2005\n* 2009\n* 2013\n* 2017\n* 2022\n |\n| San Diego | * 1887\n* 1889\n* 1891\n* 1893\n* 1895\n* 1897\n* 1899\n* 1901\n* 1903\n* 1905\n* 1907\n* 1909\n* 1911\n* 1913\n* 1915\n* 1917\n* 1919\n* 1921\n* 1923\n* 1925\n* 1927\n* 1929\n* 1931\n* 1932\n* 1935\n* 1939\n* 1943\n* 1947\n* 1951\n* 1955\n* 1959\n* 1963\n* 1967\n* 1971\n* 1975\n* 1979\n* 1983 sp\n* 1984\n* 1986 sp\n* 1988\n* 1992\n* 1996\n* 2000\n* 2004\n* 2005 sp\n* 2008\n* 2012\n* 2014 sp\n* 2016\n* 2020\n* 2024\n |\n| San Francisco | * 1955\n* 1959\n* 1963\n* 1967\n* 1971\n* 1975\n* 1979\n* 1983\n* 1987\n* 1991\n* 1995\n* 1999\n* 2003\n* 2007\n* 2011\n* 2015\n* 2018 sp\n* 2019\n* 2024\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThen-mayor Roger Hedgecock was forced to resign his post in 1985, after he was found guilty of one count of conspiracy and 12 counts of perjury, related to the alleged failure to report all campaign contributions.[4][5] After a series of appeals, the 12 perjury counts were dismissed in 1990 based on claims of juror misconduct; the remaining conspiracy count was reduced to a misdemeanor and then dismissed.[6]\n\n\nA 2002 scheme to underfund pensions for city employees led to the San Diego pension scandal. This resulted in the resignation of newly re-elected Mayor Dick Murphy[7] and the criminal indictment of six pension board members.[8] Those charges were dismissed by a federal judge in 2010.[9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n7. **^** \"San Diego's Widening Pension Woes\". *Bloomberg BusinessWeek*.

The mayor, city attorney, and council members are elected to four-year terms, with a two-term limit.[185] Elections are held on a non-partisan basis per California state law; nevertheless, most officeholders do identify themselves as either Democrats or Republicans. In 2007, registered Democrats outnumbered Republicans by about 7 to 6 in the city,[186] and Democrats currently (as of 2022[update]) hold an 8–1 majority in the city council.
