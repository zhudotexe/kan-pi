Disney films are usually co-directed and some directors have served on several winning teams: Wilfred Jackson, Hamilton Luske, Clyde Geronimi, David Hand, Ben Sharpsteen, Wolfgang Reitherman and Bill Roberts have all co-directed at least two films on the list. Only seven directors have topped the chart in consecutive years: McCarey (1944 and 1945), Nichols (1966 and 1967), Spielberg (1981 and 1982), Jackson (2002 and 2003), Verbinski (2006 and 2007) and the Russo brothers (2018 and 2019).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSteven Spielberg is the most represented director on the chart, with six films to his credit, occupying the top spot in 1975, 1981, 1982, 1984, 1989 and 1993.

DeMille (1932, 1947, 1949, 1952 and 1956) is in second place with five films and William Wyler (1942, 1946, 1959 and 1968) and James Cameron (1991, 1997, 2009 and 2022) are tied for third place with four films. D. W. Griffith (1915, 1916 and 1920), George Roy Hill (1966, 1969 and 1973) and the Russo brothers (2016, 2018 and 2019) all feature heavily with three films apiece. George Lucas directed two chart-toppers in 1977 and 1999, but also served in a strong creative capacity as a producer and writer in 1980, 1981, 1983, 1984 and 1989 as well. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | [# 3] |\n| 2021[97] | *Avatar* | $2,847,397,339 ‡ | [# 1] |\n| *2022* | $2,923,706,026 ‡ |\n\n\nRDistributor rental.\n\n\n‡Includes revenue from re-releases.

Spielberg became the first director to break his own record when *Jurassic Park* overtook *E.T.*, and Cameron emulated the feat when *Avatar* broke the record set by *Titanic*. When it took over the top spot in 2019, *Avengers: Endgame* became the first sequel to hold the record of highest-grossing film, and in doing so interrupted thirty-six years of Spielberg/Cameron dominance before *Avatar* reclaimed the top spot two years later in 2021 upon a re-release.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFilms generate income from several revenue streams, including theatrical exhibition, home video, television broadcast rights, and merchandising. However, theatrical box-office earnings are the primary metric for trade publications in assessing the success of a film, mostly because of the availability of the data compared to sales figures for home video and broadcast rights, but also because of historical practice. Included on the list are charts of the top box-office earners (ranked by both the nominal and real value of their revenue), a chart of high-grossing films by calendar year, a timeline showing the transition of the highest-grossing film record, and a chart of the highest-grossing film franchises and series.

Besides the *Star Wars* and *Superman* franchises, *James Bond* and *Godzilla* films are still being released periodically; all four are among the highest-grossing franchises. Some of the older films that held the record of highest-grossing film still have respectable grosses by today's standards, but no longer compete numerically against today's top-earners in an era of much higher individual ticket prices. When those prices are adjusted for inflation, however, then *Gone with the Wind*—which was the highest-grossing film outright for twenty-five years—is still the highest-grossing film of all time.

Grosses are not limited to original theatrical runs either, with many older films often being re-released periodically so the figures represent all the business a film has done since its original release; a film's first-run gross is included in brackets after the total if known. Because of incomplete data it cannot be known for sure how much money some films have made and when they made it, but generally the chart chronicles the films from each year that went on to earn the most.

The four *Avengers* films, the two *Frozen* films, and the two *Avatar* films are the only franchises where each installment has grossed over $1 billion, although the *Jurassic Park* and *Black Panther* series have averaged over $1 billion per film.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nTraditionally, war films, musicals, and historical dramas have been the most popular genres, but franchise films have been among the best performers of the 21st century. There is strong interest in the superhero genre, with ten films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe featuring among the nominal top-earners. The most successful superhero film, *Avengers: Endgame*, is also the second-highest-grossing film on the nominal earnings chart, and there are four films in total based on the *Avengers* comic books charting in the top twenty. Other Marvel Comics adaptations have also had success with the *Spider-Man* and *X-Men* properties, while films based on *Batman* and *Superman* from DC Comics have generally performed well. *Star Wars* is also represented in the nominal earnings chart with five films, while the *Jurassic Park* franchise features prominently. Although the nominal earnings chart is dominated by films adapted from pre-existing properties and sequels, it is headed by *Avatar*, which is an original work. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | *Fantastic Beasts *series** | $1,876,045,253\n | 3\n | $625,348,418\n | *Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them* ($814,038,508)\n |\n| 1\n | *Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them* (2016) | $814,038,508 |\n| 2\n | *The Crimes of Grindelwald* (2018) | $654,855,901 |\n| 3\n | *The Secrets of Dumbledore* (2022) | $407,150,844\n |\n\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 5\n | *James Bond* | $7,836,485,924\n | 27\n | $290,240,219\n | *Skyfall* ($1,108,569,499)\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Eon series | $7,634,741,206\n | 25\n | $305,389,648\n | *Skyfall* ($1,108,569,499)\n |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | [# 44][# 45] |\n| 26\n | 10\n | *Minions* | $1,159,444,662\n | 2015\n | [# 46][# 16] |\n| 27\n | 12\n | *Captain America: Civil War* | $1,153,337,496\n | 2016\n | [# 47][# 48] |\n| 28\n | 20\n | *Aquaman* | $1,148,528,393\n | 2018\n | [# 49][# 12] |\n| 29\n | 2\n | *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King* | $1,147,997,407\n | 2003\n | [# 50][# 51] |\n| 30\n | 24RK | *Spider-Man: Far From Home* | $1,131,927,996\n | 2019\n | [# 52][# 4] |\n| 31\n | 23RK | *Captain Marvel* | $1,128,274,794\n | 2019\n | [# 53][# 54] |\n| 32\n | 5RK | *Transformers: Dark of the Moon* | $1,123,794,079\n | 2011\n | [# 55][# 34] |\n| 33\n | 7\n | *Skyfall* | $1,108,569,499\n | 2012\n | [# 56][# 57] |\n| 34\n | 10\n | *Transformers: Age of Extinction* | $1,104,054,072\n | 2014\n | [# 58][# 59] |\n| 35\n | 7\n | *The Dark Knight Rises* | $1,081,169,825\n | 2012\n | [# 60][# 61] |\n| 36\n | 31\n | *Joker* | $1,074,458,282\n | 2019\n | [# 62][# 25] |\n| 37\n | 32\n | *Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker* | $1,074,144,248\n | 2019\n | [# 63][# 25] |\n| 38\n | 30\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 14\n | *Avatar* | $5,243,956,307\n | 2\n | $2,621,978,154\n | *Avatar* ($2,923,706,026)\n |\n| 1\n | *Avatar* (2009) | $2,923,706,026 |\n| 2\n | *The Way of Water* (2022) | $2,320,250,281\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 15\n | *Despicable Me* | $4,647,796,993\n | 5\n | $929,559,399\n | *Minions* ($1,159,444,662)\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Main series | $2,548,724,121\n | 3\n | $849,574,707\n | *Despicable Me 3* ($1,034,800,131)\n |\n| 1\n | *Despicable Me 3* (2017) | $1,034,800,131 |\n| 2\n | *Despicable Me 2* (2013) | $970,766,005 |\n| 3\n | *Despicable Me* (2010) | $543,157,985\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | *Minions* series | $2,099,072,872\n | 2\n | $1,049,536,436\n | *Minions* ($1,159,444,662)\n |\n| 1\n | *Minions* (2015) | $1,159,444,662 |\n| 2\n | *The Rise of Gru* (2022) | $939,628,210\n |\n\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_nNIJFH9aWHLGJ5D7EuSPmYII","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
