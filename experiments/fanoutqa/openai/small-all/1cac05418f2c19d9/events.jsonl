The number of people living in urban areas grew by 31.2% between 1991 and 2001.[367] Yet, in 2001, over 70% still lived in rural areas.[368][369] The level of urbanisation increased further from 27.81% in the 2001 Census to 31.16% in the 2011 Census. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSince 1991, economic inequality between India's states has consistently grown: the per-capita net state domestic product of the richest states in 2007 was 3.2 times that of the poorest.[357] Corruption in India is perceived to have decreased. According to the Corruption Perceptions Index, India ranked 78th out of 180 countries in 2018 with a score of 41 out of 100, an improvement from 85th in 2014.[358][359]\n\n\nEpidemic and pandemic diseases have long been a major factor, including COVID-19 recently.[360]\n\n\n\n## Demographics, languages and religion[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Demographics of India, Languages of India, and Religion in India\n\nSee also: South Asian ethnic groups\n\nIndia by language\n![](image)\nThe language families of South Asia\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDespite economic growth during recent decades, India continues to face socio-economic challenges.

Following independence they constituted the largest non-indigenous ethnic group in Uganda, at around 80,000 people, and they dominated trade, industry, and the professions. This caused resentment among the native African majority, which was exploited by post-Independence leaders.\n\n\nAfter Idi Amin came to power in 1971, he declared \"economic war\" on the Indians, culminating in the Expulsion of Asians in Uganda in 1972. Since Amin's overthrow in 1979 some Asians have returned. There are between 15,000 and 25,000 in Uganda today, nearly all in the capital Kampala.\n\n\nThere are also about 10,000 Europeans, mostly of native English origin, and 3,000 Arabs of various national origins in Uganda.\n\n\n\n## Other demographic statistics[edit]\n\n\nDemographic statistics of Uganda in 2022:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAspect of human geography in Uganda\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This article **needs additional citations for verification**.

this means it can be spread more easily to people who are unvaccinated against polio and who come in contact with the stool or respiratory secretions, such as from a sneeze, of an “infected” person who received oral polio vaccine;

This trend continued during the first two decades of the 20th century. In 1900, the Mexican population was 13.6 million.[249] The 1921 census reported a loss of about 1 million inhabitants. The Mexican Revolution (c. 1910–1920) greatly impacted population increases. The growth rate increased dramatically between the 1930s and the 1980s, when the country registered growth rates of over 3% (1950–1980). The Mexican population doubled in twenty years, and at that rate it was expected that by 2000 there would be 120 million people living in Mexico. Mexico's population grew from 70 million in 1982 to 120 million in 2015.[250]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLife expectancy increased from 36 years (in 1895) to 72 years (in 2000).

Although relations among the diverse population are mostly harmonious, acute sectarian discontent and violence remain problematic in some areas.[73] A political settlement to an armed separatist conflict in Aceh was achieved in 2005.[74]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)University of Indonesia is one of Indonesia's top universities\nEducation is compulsory for 12 years.[277] Parents can choose between state-run, non-sectarian schools or private or semi-private religious (usually Islamic) schools, supervised by the ministries of Education and Religion, respectively.[278] Private international schools that do not follow the national curriculum are also available. The enrolment rate is 93% for primary education, 79% for secondary education, and 36% for tertiary education (2018).[279] The literacy rate is 96% (2018), and the government spends about 3.6% of GDP (2015) on education.[279] In 2018, there were 4,670 higher educational institutions in Indonesia, with most (74%) located in Sumatra and Java.[280][281] According to the QS World University Rankings, Indonesia's top universities are the University of Indonesia, Gadjah Mada University and the Bandung Institute of Technology.[282]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Javanese are the largest ethnic group, constituting 40.2% of the population,[2] and are politically dominant.[230] They are predominantly located in the central to eastern parts of Java and also in sizeable numbers in most provinces. The Sundanese are the next largest group (15.4%), followed by Batak, Madurese, Betawi, Minangkabau, Bugis and Malay people.[d] A sense of Indonesian nationhood exists alongside strong regional identities.[231]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_oUBIBb5xyJQjZSUIRbjcZapb","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

It has a bicameral national legislature composed of the House of Representatives, a lower house based on population; and the Senate, an upper house based on equal representation for each state. Many policy issues are decentralized at a state or local level, with widely differing laws by jurisdiction which may not conflict with the Constitution.[26][27] The U.S. ranks very highly in international measures of quality of life, income and wealth, economic competitiveness, human rights, innovation, and education; it has low levels of perceived corruption. It has higher levels of incarceration and inequality than most other liberal democracies and is the only liberal democracy without universal healthcare.

It belongs to the Austroasiatic language family, which also includes languages such as Khmer and Mon. Vietnamese was spoken by 85-90 million people in Vietnam at the 1999 census. In the early 21st century, around another four million Vietnamese speakers are found outside of Vietnam, mostly refugees from the Vietnam-American War. Thus Vietnamese is the most spoken language of the Austroasiatic family, being spoken by three times more people than the second most spoken language of the family, Khmer. Both languages, however, are extremely different: Vietnamese is a tonal, monosyllabic language while Khmer has remained non-tonal. Vietnamese was heavily influenced by Chinese, with up to around 50-70% words having Chinese origins, whilst Khmer was heavily influenced by Sanskrit and Pali, uses a abugida writing system, and has a great part of its vocabulary originating from Indian languages. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe relation between China and Vietnam also declined following reunification in 1975, with Vietnam siding with the Soviet Union against China in the Chinese-Soviet split. Tensions peaked when Vietnam and Cambodia started a war, Cambodia lead by Pol Pot being a Chinese ally, resulting in a Chinese invasion of Vietnam in 1979. In 1978-79, some 450,000 ethnic Chinese left Vietnam by boat as refugees (many officially encouraged and assisted) or were expelled across the land border with China. In recent years the government has performed an about turn and is encouraging overseas Hoa to return and invest, but the ethnic Chinese population has been in continuous decline since the 1970s due to assimilation and low birth rates.\n\n\nThe central highland peoples commonly termed Degar or Montagnards (mountain people) comprise two main ethnolinguistic groups--Malayo-Polynesian and Mon–Khmer. About 30 groups of various cultures and dialects are spread over the highland territory.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOther minority groups include the Cham—remnants of the once-mighty Champa Kingdom, conquered by the Vietnamese in the 15th century, Hmong, and Thái.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Lô Lô | Tibeto-Burman |  |  | 3,307\n | 0.00\n | 2,218\n | 0.00\n | 4,827\n | 0.01\n |\n| Mảng | Mon-Khmer |  |  | 2,663\n | 0.00\n | 3,700\n | 0.00\n | 4,650\n | 0.00\n |\n| Cờ Lao | Tai-Kadai |  |  | 1,865\n | 0.00\n | 2,636\n | 0.00\n | 4,003\n | 0.00\n |\n| Bố Y | Tai-Kadai |  |  | 1,864\n | 0.00\n | 2,273\n | 0.00\n | 3,232\n | 0.00\n |\n| Cống | Tibeto-Burman |  |  | 1,676\n | 0.00\n | 2,029\n | 0.00\n | 2,729\n | 0.00\n |\n| Ngái | Chinese |  |  | 4,841\n | 0.01\n | 1,035\n | 0.00\n | 1,649\n | 0.00\n |\n| Si La | Tibeto-Burman |  |  | 840\n | 0.00\n | 709\n | 0.00\n | 909\n | 0.00\n |\n| Pu Péo | Tai-Kadai |  |  | 705\n | 0.00\n | 687\n | 0.00\n | 903\n | 0.00\n |\n| Rơ Măm | Mon-Khmer |  |  | 352\n | 0.00\n | 436\n | 0.00\n | 639\n | 0.00\n |\n| Brâu | Mon-Khmer |  |  | 313\n | 0.00\n | 397\n | 0.00\n | 525\n | 0.00\n |\n| Ơ Đu | Mon-Khmer |  |  | 301\n | 0.00\n | 376\n | 0.00\n | 428\n | 0.00\n |\n| Foreigners\n |  |  | 39,532\n | 0.05\n | 2,134\n | 0.00\n | 3,553\n | 0.00\n |\n| Others\n | 2,767,512\n | 4.3\n | 1,333\n | 0.0\n | 82,942\n | 0.0\n | 349\n | 0.00\n |\n| Total\n | 64,411,713\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | 891,151\n | 0.93\n |\n| Hoa | Chinese | 961,702\n | 1.5\n | 862,371\n | 1.1\n | 823,071\n | 1.0\n | 749,466\n | 0.78\n |\n| Gia Rai | Malayo-Polynesian |  |  | 317,557\n | 0.42\n | 411,275\n | 0.48\n | 513,930\n | 0.53\n |\n| Ê Đê | Malayo-Polynesian |  |  | 270,348\n | 0.35\n | 331,194\n | 0.39\n | 398,671\n | 0.41\n |\n| Ba Na | Mon-Khmer |  |  | 174,456\n | 0.23\n | 227,716\n | 0.27\n | 286,910\n | 0.30\n |\n| Xơ Đăng | Mon-Khmer |  |  | 127,148\n | 0.17\n | 169,501\n | 0.20\n | 212,277\n | 0.22\n |\n| Sán Chay | Tai-Kadai |  |  | 147,315\n | 0.19\n | 169,410\n | 0.20\n | 201,398\n | 0.21\n |\n| Cờ Ho | Mon-Khmer |  |  | 128,723\n | 0.17\n | 166,112\n | 0.19\n | 200,800\n | 0.21\n |\n| Sán Dìu | Chinese |  |  | 126,237\n | 0.17\n | 146,821\n | 0.17\n | 183,004\n | 0.19\n |\n| Chăm | Malayo-Polynesian |  |  | 132,873\n | 0.17\n | 161,729\n | 0.19\n | 178,948\n | 0.19\n |\n| Hrê | Mon-Khmer |  |  | 113,111\n | 0.15\n | 63,012\n | 0.07\n | 149,460\n | 0.16\n |\n| Ra Glai | Malayo-Polynesian |  |  | 96,931\n | 0.13\n | 122,245\n | 0.14\n | 146,613\n | 0.15\n |\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_N91ayMr0yabMdBdErlVd7vOo","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

Some of these religions are Jehovah's Witnesses (1,100,000), Latter-day Saints (200,000), Buddhism (215,000), Judaism (86,000), and Islam (27,000).[115]\n\n\nBrazil has the largest Roman Catholic population in the world.[116]\n\n\nFollowers of Protestantism are rising in number. Until 1970, the majority of Brazilian Protestants were adherents of \"traditional churches\", mostly Lutherans, Presbyterians and Baptists. There are 120,000 Episcopalians in 9 dioceses (Anglican Episcopal Church of Brazil). Since then, numbers of Pentecostal and Neopentecostal adherents have increased significantly.\n\n\nIslam in Brazil was first practiced by African slaves.[117] The Muslim population in Brazil is made up mostly of Arab immigrants.[118]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n24. **^** \"Tabela 1.3.1 – População residente, por cor ou raça, segundo o sexo e os Sexo e grupos de idade : Brasil – 2010\" (PDF). *Ibge.gov.br*.

For instance, of those who reported residing in another country less than 10 years before the 2000 census, 66.9 percent were Brazilians. If only the returning migrants (former Brazilian immigrants) are considered, 26.8 percent of Brazilians came from Paraguay, 17 percent came from Japan, and 15.8 percent came from the United States.[37]\n\n\nAs political unrest, increasing violence, inflation, soaring unemployment rates and an economic crisis hit Brazil, millions of citizens moved abroad starting in 2011, generating the largest emigration process ever witnessed in Brazilian history, since Brazil has historically been a land of immigrants. In 2021 more than 4.4 million Brazilians live abroad,[38] this is an increase of around 132% compared to the previous 10 years.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThere are also noticeable Brazilian communities in countries once source of immigrants such as Japan (210,000 Brazilians in 2021), Italy (162,000 Brazilians in 2021), Germany (140,000 Brazilians in 2021), the Netherlands (65,000 Brazilians in 2021) and Lebanon (21,000 Brazilians in 2021). Many of the Brazilians found in these countries are descendants of the early immigrants who came to Brazil in the early 1900s.\n\n\nThere is also a sizeable Brazilian community in France (172,000 Brazilians in 2021), almost equally split between Metropolitan France and French Guyana.\n\n\n\n## Racial composition[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Race and ethnicity in Brazil\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Central-West region of Brazil was inhabited by diverse Indians when the Portuguese arrived in the early 18th century. The Portuguese came to explore the precious stones that were found there. Contact between the Portuguese and the Indians created a mixed-race population. Until the mid-20th century, Central-West Brazil had a very small population. The situation changed with the construction of Brasília, the new capital of Brazil, in 1960. Many workers were attracted to the region, mostly from northeastern Brazil.\n\n\nA new wave of settlers started arriving from the 1970s. With the mechanization of agriculture in the South of Brazil, many rural workers of German and Italian origin migrated to Central-West Brazil. In some areas, they are already the majority of the population.\n\n\n\n## Education and health[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Education in Brazil and Health care in Brazil\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Years | 1961 | 1962 | 1963 | 1964 | 1965 | 1966 | 1967 | 1968 | 1969 | 1970[16] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Total fertility rate in Brazil | 6.05 | 6 | 5.94 | 5.85 | 5.73 | 5.6 | 5.45 | 5.3 | 5.15 | 5.01\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Years | 1971 | 1972 | 1973 | 1974 | 1975 | 1976 | 1977 | 1978 | 1979 | 1980[16] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Total fertility rate in Brazil | 4.88 | 4.76 | 4.65 | 4.55 | 4.46 | 4.39 | 4.31 | 4.24 | 4.16 | 4.07\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Years | 1981 | 1982 | 1983 | 1984 | 1985 | 1986 | 1987 | 1988 | 1989 | 1990[16] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Total fertility rate in Brazil | 3.97 | 3.86 | 3.74 | 3.62 | 3.49 | 3.36 | 3.23 | 3.11 | 3.01 | 2.91\n |\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nImmigration has been a very important demographic factor in the formation, structure and history of the population in Brazil, influencing culture, economy, education, racial issues, etc. Brazil has received the third largest number of immigrants in the Western Hemisphere.\n\n\nBrazil's structure, legislation and settlement policies for arriving immigrants were much less organized than in Canada and the United States at the time.

The population growth rate for 2016 is estimated to be 0.9%.[285] About 26.8% of the population were 15 years old or younger, 65.7% were between 15 and 64 years old, and 7.4% were over 65 years old. The proportion of older persons in the total population has begun to increase substantially.[286] Colombia is projected to have a population of 55.3 million by 2050.[287]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe population is concentrated in the Andean highlands and along the Caribbean coast, also the population densities are generally higher in the Andean region. The nine eastern lowland departments, comprising about 54% of Colombia's area, have less than 6% of the population.[163][164] Traditionally a rural society, movement to urban areas was very heavy in the mid-20th century, and Colombia is now one of the most urbanized countries in Latin America. The urban population increased from 31% of the total in 1938 to nearly 60% in 1973, and by 2014 the figure stood at 76%.[288][289] The population of Bogotá alone has increased from just over 300,000 in 1938 to approximately 8 million today.[290] In total seventy-two cities now have populations of 100,000 or more (2015). As of 2012[update] Colombia has the world's largest populations of internally displaced persons (IDPs), estimated to be up to 4.9 million people.[291]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n**Colombia** (/kəˈlʌmbiə/ ⓘ, /-ˈlɒm-/;[14] Spanish: [koˈlombja] ⓘ), officially the **Republic of Colombia**,[b] is a country mostly in South America with insular regions in North America. The Colombian mainland is bordered by the Caribbean Sea to the north, Venezuela to the east and northeast, Brazil to the southeast, Ecuador and Peru to the south and southwest, the Pacific Ocean to the west, and Panama to the northwest. Colombia is divided into 32 departments. The Capital District of Bogotá is also the country's largest city hosting the main financial and cultural hub. Other major urbes include Medellín, Cali, Barranquilla, Cartagena, Santa Marta, Cúcuta, Ibagué, Villavicencio and Bucaramanga. It covers an area of 1,141,748 square kilometers (440,831 sq mi), and has a population of around 52 million. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n284. **^** \"Colombia – Population\".

The 40-year low in murders came the same year the government signed a peace agreement with the FARC.[336] The murder rate further decreased to 22.6 in 2020, though still among the highest in the world, it decreased 73% from 84 in 1991. In the 1980s and 1990s it regularly ranked as number one.\n\n\n\nSince the beginning of the crisis in Venezuela and the mass emigration of Venezuelans during the Venezuelan refugee crisis, desperate Venezuelans have been recruited into gangs in order to survive.[337] Venezuelan women have also resorted to prostitution in order to make a living in Colombia.[337]\n\n### Urbanization[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 10 | Bello | Antioquia | 495,483 | 20 | Armenia | Quindío | 287,245\n |\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Culture of Colombia\n\nSee also: Festivals in Colombia and Colombian folklore\n\nColombia lies at the crossroads of Latin America and the broader American continent, and as such has been hit by a wide range of cultural influences.

Consumption expenditure by households is the largest component of GDP.[221][31][222]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nColombia is one of the world's seventeen megadiverse countries; it has the highest level of biodiversity per square mile in the world and the second-highest level overall.[29] Its territory encompasses Amazon rainforest, highlands, grasslands and deserts. It is the only country in South America with coastlines (and islands) along both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Colombia is a key member of major global and regional organizations including the UN, the WTO, the OECD, the OAS, the Pacific Alliance and the Andean Community; it is also a NATO Global Partner.[30] Its diversified economy is the third-largest in South America, with macroeconomic stability and favorable long-term growth prospects.[31][32]\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nProtected areas and the \"National Park System\" cover an area of about 14,268,224 hectares (142,682.24 km2) and account for 12.77% of the Colombian territory.[175] Compared to neighboring countries, rates of deforestation in Colombia are still relatively low.[176] Colombia had a 2018 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 8.26/10, ranking it 25th globally out of 172 countries.[177] Colombia is the sixth country in the world by magnitude of total renewable freshwater supply, and still has large reserves of freshwater.[178]\n\n\n\n## Government and politics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Government of Colombia\n\nSee also: Colombian Constitution of 1991\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n162. **^** \"The Republic of Colombia shares land borders with five (5) countries\". cancilleria.gov.co.\n163. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** \"Distribution of the population by regions\". geoportal.dane.gov.co.

The country suffered a recession in 1999 (the first full year of negative growth since the Great Depression), and the recovery from that recession was long and painful. However, in recent years growth has been impressive, reaching 6.9% in 2007, one of the highest rates of growth in Latin America.[26] According to International Monetary Fund estimates, in 2012, Colombia's GDP (PPP) was US$500 billion (28th in the world and third in South America).[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nColombia has been home to many indigenous peoples and cultures since at least 12,000 BCE. The Spanish first landed in La Guajira in 1499, and by the mid-16th century they had colonized much of present-day Colombia, and established the New Kingdom of Granada, with Santa Fé de Bogotá as its capital. Independence from the Spanish Empire was achieved in 1819, with what is now Colombia emerging as the United Provinces of New Granada. The new polity experimented with federalism as the Granadine Confederation (1858) and then the United States of Colombia (1863), before becoming a republic—the current Republic of Colombia—in 1886. With the backing of the United States and France, Panama seceded from Colombia in 1903, resulting in Colombia's present borders. Beginning in the 1960s, the country has suffered from an asymmetric low-intensity armed conflict and political violence, both of which escalated in the 1990s. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n3. **^** Homburger, J.

Guatemala has been described as the most heavily evangelical nation in Latin America,[210] with multitudes of unregistered churches,[211] although Brazil[212] or Honduras may be as heavily evangelical as Guatemala.\n\n\nOver the past two decades, particularly since the end of the civil war, Guatemala has seen heightened missionary activity. Protestant denominations have grown markedly in recent decades, chiefly Evangelical and Pentecostal varieties; growth is particularly strong among the ethnic Maya population, with the National Evangelical Presbyterian Church of Guatemala maintaining 11 indigenous-language presbyteries. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has grown from 40,000 members in 1984 to 164,000 in 1998, and continues to expand.[213][214]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGross Domestic Product (GDP) in purchasing power parity (PPP) in 2010 was estimated at US$70.15 billion.

Mines produce gold, silver, zinc, cobalt and nickel.[187] The agricultural sector accounts for about two-fifths of exports, and half of the labor force. Organic coffee, sugar, textiles, fresh vegetables, and bananas are the country's main exports. Inflation was 3.9% in 2010.\n\n\nThe 1996 peace accords that ended the decades-long civil war removed a major obstacle to foreign investment. Tourism has become an increasing source of revenue for Guatemala thanks to the new foreign investment.\n\n\nIn March 2006, Guatemala's congress ratified the Dominican Republic – Central American Free Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA) between several Central American nations and the United States.[188] Guatemala also has free trade agreements with Taiwan and Colombia.\n\n\n\n### Tourism[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nCountry in Central America\n\nThis article is about the country in Central America.
