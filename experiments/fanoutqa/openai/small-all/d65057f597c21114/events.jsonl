Further, there is a distinction between the plural first-person pronoun *zánmen* (咱们/咱們), which is inclusive of the listener, and *wǒmen* (我们/我們), which may be exclusive of the listener. Dialects of Mandarin agree with each other quite consistently on these pronouns. While the first and second person singular pronouns are cognate with forms in other varieties of Chinese, the rest of the pronominal system is a Mandarin innovation (e.g., Shanghainese has *non* 侬/儂 'you' and *yi* 伊 'he', 'she').[101]\n\n\nBecause of contact with Mongolian and Manchurian peoples, Mandarin (especially the Northeastern varieties) has some loanwords from these languages not present in other varieties of Chinese, such as *hútòng* (胡同) \"alley\". Southern Chinese varieties have borrowed from Tai,[102] Austroasiatic,[103] and Austronesian languages.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThis standard language is now used in education, the media, and formal occasions in both mainland China and Taiwan, as well as among the Chinese community of Singapore.[29][30] However in other parts of the Chinese-speaking world, namely Hong Kong and Macau, the standard form of Chinese used in education, the media, formal speech, and everyday life remains the local Cantonese because of their colonial and linguistic history.[31] While Standard Mandarin is now the medium of instruction in schools throughout China, it still has yet to gain traction as a common language among the local population in areas where Mandarin dialects are not native.[32] In these regions, people may be either diglossic or speak the standard language with a notable accent.[33] However since the start of the 21st century, there has been an effort of mass education in Standard Mandarin Chinese and discouragement of local language usage by the Chinese government in order to erase these regional differences.[34]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Chinese capital has been within the Mandarin-speaking area for most of the last millennium, making these dialects very influential. Some form of Mandarin has served as a lingua franca for government officials and the courts since the 14th century.[3] By the early 20th century, a standard form based on the Beijing dialect, with elements from other Mandarin dialects, was adopted as the national language. Standard Mandarin Chinese is the official language of the People's Republic of China[4] and Taiwan,[5] as well as one of the four official languages of Singapore. It is also used as one of the official languages of the United Nations.[6] Recent increased migration from Mandarin-speaking regions of China and Taiwan has now resulted in the language being one of the more frequently used varieties of Chinese among Chinese diaspora communities. It is also the most commonly taught Chinese variety.\n\n\n\n\n## Name[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA speaker from Tanghe (Central Plains Mandarin)\n**Mandarin** (/ˈmændərɪn/ ⓘ; simplified Chinese: 官话; traditional Chinese: 官話; pinyin: *Guānhuà*; lit. 'officials' speech') is a group of Sinitic dialects that are natively spoken across most of northern and southwestern China. The group includes the Beijing dialect, the basis of the phonology of Standard Chinese, the official language of China. Because Mandarin originated in North China and most Mandarin dialects are found in the north, the group is sometimes referred to as **Northern Chinese** (simplified Chinese: 北方话; traditional Chinese: 北方話; pinyin: *Běifānghuà*; lit. 'northern speech'). Many varieties of Mandarin, such as those of the Southwest (including Sichuanese) and the Lower Yangtze, are not mutually intelligible with the standard language (or are only partially intelligible). Nevertheless, Mandarin as a group is often placed first in lists of languages by number of native speakers (with nearly one billion).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Minority | * Kazakh\n* Korean\n* Kyrgyz\n* Russian\n* Esperanto\n* Tatar\n* Tuvan\n* Uzbek\n* Vietnamese (Kinh)\n* Wakhi\n |\n| Varieties ofChinese | * Mandarin\n\t+ Northeastern\n\t+ Beijing\n\t+ Ji-Lu\n\t+ Jiao-Liao\n\t+ Zhongyuan\n\t\t- Lan-Yin\n\t+ Jin\n\t+ Southwestern\n\t\t- Sichuanese\n\t+ Southeastern\n* Gan\n* Hakka\n* Hui\n* Min\n\t+ Southern\n\t\t- Hokkien\n\t\t- Teoswa\n\t\t- Hainanese\n\t+ Eastern\n\t+ Puxian\n\t+ Central\n\t+ Northern\n\t+ Shaojiang\n* Wu\n\t+ Northern\n\t+ Auish\n* Xiang\n\t+ New\n\t+ Old\n* Yue\n\t+ Cantonese\n\t+ Ping\n |\n| Creole/Mixed | * E\n* Hezhou\n* Lingling\n* Macanese\n* Maojia\n* Qoqmončaq\n* Sanqiao\n* Tangwang\n* Wutun\n |\n| Extinct | * Ba–Shu\n* Jie\n* Khitan\n* Old Yue\n* Rouran\n* Saka\n* Tangut\n* Tocharian\n* Tuoba\n* Tuyuhun\n* Xianbei\n* Zhangzhung\n |\n| Sign | * Chinese Sign\n\t+ Northern (Beijing) Sign\n\t+ Southern (Shanghai) Sign\n\t\t- Hong Kong Sign**HK/MC**\n* Tibetan Sign**XZ**\n |\n| * GX = Guangxi\n* HK = Hong Kong\n* MC = Macau\n* NM = Inner Mongolia\n* XJ = Xinjiang\n* XZ = Tibet\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nLanguages of Taiwan\n |\n| --- |\n| Austronesian | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn everyday English, \"Mandarin\" refers to Standard Chinese, which is often called simply \"Chinese\".

The codified forms of both *Pǔtōnghuà* and *Guóyǔ* base their phonology on the Beijing accent, and also take some elements from other sources, and deviate from the Beijing dialect in vocabulary, grammar, and pragmatics.[35] Comparison of dictionaries produced in the two areas will show that there are few substantial differences. However, both versions of \"school-standard\" Chinese are often quite different from the Mandarin varieties that are spoken in accordance with regional habits, and neither is wholly identical to the Beijing dialect.[36]\n\n\nThe written forms of Standard Chinese are also essentially equivalent, although simplified characters are used in mainland China and Singapore, while traditional characters remain in use in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau.[37] Singapore has followed mainland China in officially adopting simplified characters.[38]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Chen, Yiya; Guo, Li (2022). \"Zhushan Mandarin\".

Such languages include Fiji Hindi, which has an official status in Fiji,[29] and Caribbean Hindustani, which is spoken in Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, and Guyana.[30][31][32][33] Apart from the script and formal vocabulary, standard Hindi is mutually intelligible with standard Urdu, another recognised register of Hindustani as both share a common colloquial base.[34]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n23. **^** \"Constitutional Provisions: Official Language Related Part-17 of The Constitution Of India\".

However, widespread resistance to the imposition of Hindi on non-native speakers, especially in South India (such as those in Tamil Nadu) led to the passage of the Official Languages Act of 1963, which provided for the continued use of English indefinitely for all official purposes, although the constitutional directive for the Union Government to encourage the spread of Hindi was retained and has strongly influenced its policies.[73]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n53. **^** Kesavan, B.

During the time of British rule, Hindi (in its religiously neutral, 'Hindustani' variety) increasingly came to be the symbol of national unity over against the English of the foreign oppressor. And Hindustani was learned widely throughout India, even in Bengal and the Dravidian south. ... Independence had been accompanied by the division of former British India into two countries, Pakistan and India. The former had been established as a Muslim state and had made Urdu, the Muslim variety of Hindi–Urdu or Hindustani, its national language.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Hindi | Meaning | Portuguese\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| *anānās* (अनानास) | pineapple | ananás\n |\n| *pādrī* (पाद्री) | priest | padre\n |\n| *bālṭī* (बाल्टी) | bucket | balde\n |\n| *čābī* (चाबी) | key | chave\n |\n| *girjā* (गिर्जा) | church | igreja\n |\n| *almārī* (अलमारी) | cupboard | armário\n |\n| *botal* (बोतल) | bottle | botelha\n |\n| *aspatāl* (अस्पताल) | hospital | Hospital\n |\n| *olandez* (ओलंदेज़) | Dutch | holandês\n |\n\n\n## Media[edit]\n\n\n### Literature[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Hindi literature\n\nHindi literature is broadly divided into four prominent forms or styles, being *Bhakti* (devotional – Kabir, Raskhan); *Śṛṇgār* (beauty – Keshav, Bihari); *Vīgāthā* (epic); and *Ādhunik* (modern).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n45. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Brief History of Hindi\". *Central Hindi Directorate*.

Devanagari consists of 11 vowels and 33 consonants and is written from left to right. Unlike Sanskrit, Devanagari is not entirely phonetic for Hindi, especially failing to mark schwa deletion in spoken Standard Hindi.[113]\n\n\n\n### Romanization[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Devanagari transliteration\n\nThe Government of India uses Hunterian transliteration as its official system of writing Hindi in the Latin script.
