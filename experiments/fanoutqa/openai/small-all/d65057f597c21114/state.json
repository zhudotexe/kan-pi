Further, there is a distinction between the plural first-person pronoun *z\u00e1nmen* (\u54b1\u4eec/\u54b1\u5011), which is inclusive of the listener, and *w\u01d2men* (\u6211\u4eec/\u6211\u5011), which may be exclusive of the listener. Dialects of Mandarin agree with each other quite consistently on these pronouns. While the first and second person singular pronouns are cognate with forms in other varieties of Chinese, the rest of the pronominal system is a Mandarin innovation (e.g., Shanghainese has *non* \u4fac/\u5102 'you' and *yi* \u4f0a 'he', 'she').[101]\n\n\nBecause of contact with Mongolian and Manchurian peoples, Mandarin (especially the Northeastern varieties) has some loanwords from these languages not present in other varieties of Chinese, such as *h\u00fat\u00f2ng* (\u80e1\u540c) \"alley\".

Some form of Mandarin has served as a lingua franca for government officials and the courts since the 14th century.[3] By the early 20th century, a standard form based on the Beijing dialect, with elements from other Mandarin dialects, was adopted as the national language. Standard Mandarin Chinese is the official language of the People's Republic of China[4] and Taiwan,[5] as well as one of the four official languages of Singapore. It is also used as one of the official languages of the United Nations.[6] Recent increased migration from Mandarin-speaking regions of China and Taiwan has now resulted in the language being one of the more frequently used varieties of Chinese among Chinese diaspora communities. It is also the most commonly taught Chinese variety.\n\n\n\n\n## Name[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA speaker from Tanghe (Central Plains Mandarin)\n**Mandarin** (/\u02c8m\u00e6nd\u0259r\u026an/ \u24d8; simplified Chinese: \u5b98\u8bdd; traditional Chinese: \u5b98\u8a71; pinyin: *Gu\u0101nhu\u00e0*; lit. 'officials' speech') is a group of Sinitic dialects that are natively spoken across most of northern and southwestern China. The group includes the Beijing dialect, the basis of the phonology of Standard Chinese, the official language of China. Because Mandarin originated in North China and most Mandarin dialects are found in the north, the group is sometimes referred to as **Northern Chinese** (simplified Chinese: \u5317\u65b9\u8bdd; traditional Chinese: \u5317\u65b9\u8a71; pinyin: *B\u011bif\u0101nghu\u00e0*; lit. 'northern speech'). Many varieties of Mandarin, such as those of the Southwest (including Sichuanese) and the Lower Yangtze, are not mutually intelligible with the standard language (or are only partially intelligible). Nevertheless, Mandarin as a group is often placed first in lists of languages by number of native speakers (with nearly one billion).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Minority | * Kazakh\n* Korean\n* Kyrgyz\n* Russian\n* Esperanto\n* Tatar\n* Tuvan\n* Uzbek\n* Vietnamese (Kinh)\n* Wakhi\n |\n| Varieties ofChinese | * Mandarin\n\t+ Northeastern\n\t+ Beijing\n\t+ Ji-Lu\n\t+ Jiao-Liao\n\t+ Zhongyuan\n\t\t- Lan-Yin\n\t+ Jin\n\t+ Southwestern\n\t\t- Sichuanese\n\t+ Southeastern\n* Gan\n* Hakka\n* Hui\n* Min\n\t+ Southern\n\t\t- Hokkien\n\t\t- Teoswa\n\t\t- Hainanese\n\t+ Eastern\n\t+ Puxian\n\t+ Central\n\t+ Northern\n\t+ Shaojiang\n* Wu\n\t+ Northern\n\t+ Auish\n* Xiang\n\t+ New\n\t+ Old\n* Yue\n\t+ Cantonese\n\t+ Ping\n |\n| Creole/Mixed | * E\n* Hezhou\n* Lingling\n* Macanese\n* Maojia\n* Qoqmon\u010daq\n* Sanqiao\n* Tangwang\n* Wutun\n |\n| Extinct | * Ba\u2013Shu\n* Jie\n* Khitan\n* Old Yue\n* Rouran\n* Saka\n* Tangut\n* Tocharian\n* Tuoba\n* Tuyuhun\n* Xianbei\n* Zhangzhung\n |\n| Sign | * Chinese Sign\n\t+ Northern (Beijing) Sign\n\t+ Southern (Shanghai) Sign\n\t\t- Hong Kong Sign**HK/MC**\n* Tibetan Sign**XZ**\n |\n| * GX = Guangxi\n* HK = Hong Kong\n* MC = Macau\n* NM = Inner Mongolia\n* XJ = Xinjiang\n* XZ = Tibet\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nLanguages of Taiwan\n |\n| --- |\n| Austronesian | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn everyday English, \"Mandarin\" refers to Standard Chinese, which is often called simply \"Chinese\".

The codified forms of both *P\u01d4t\u014dnghu\u00e0* and *Gu\u00f3y\u01d4* base their phonology on the Beijing accent, and also take some elements from other sources, and deviate from the Beijing dialect in vocabulary, grammar, and pragmatics.[35] Comparison of dictionaries produced in the two areas will show that there are few substantial differences. However, both versions of \"school-standard\" Chinese are often quite different from the Mandarin varieties that are spoken in accordance with regional habits, and neither is wholly identical to the Beijing dialect.[36]\n\n\nThe written forms of Standard Chinese are also essentially equivalent, although simplified characters are used in mainland China and Singapore, while traditional characters remain in use in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau.[37] Singapore has followed mainland China in officially adopting simplified characters.[38]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Chen, Yiya; Guo, Li (2022). \"Zhushan Mandarin\".

Aside from Mandarin, the other six are Wu, Gan, and Xiang in central China and Min, Hakka, and Yue on the southeast coast.[12] The *Language Atlas of China* (1987) distinguishes three further groups: Jin (split from Mandarin), Huizhou in the Huizhou region of Anhui and Zhejiang, and Pinghua in Guangxi and Yunnan.[13][14]\n\n\n\n### Old Mandarin[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Old Mandarin\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)A page of the *Menggu Ziyun*, covering the syllables *tsim* to *lim*\nAfter the fall of the Northern Song (959\u20131126) and during the reign of the Jin (1115\u20131234) and Yuan (Mongol) dynasties in northern China, a common form of speech developed based on the dialects of the North China Plain around the capital, a language referred to as Old Mandarin. New genres of vernacular literature were based on this language, including verse, drama and story forms, such as the *qu* and *sanqu* poetry.[15]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Ting, Pang-Hsin (1991), \"Some theoretical issues in the study of Mandarin dialects\", in Wang, William S-Y.

It is the Mandarin variant used in education, media, and official settings. Meanwhile, a colloquial form called Singdarin is used in informal daily life and is heavily influenced in terms of both grammar and vocabulary by local languages such as Cantonese, Hokkien, and Malay. Instances of code-switching with English, Hokkien, Cantonese, Malay, or a combination of any of these is also common.\n\n\n\n#### Malaysia[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Malaysian Mandarin\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Lower Yangtze Mandarin (or Jiang\u2013Huai, 86 million), spoken in the parts of Jiangsu and Anhui on the north bank of the Yangtze, as well as some areas on the south bank, such as Nanjing in Jiangsu, Jiujiang in Jiangxi, etc.[85] There are significant phonological and lexical changes to varying degrees, and intelligibility with Beijing is limited. Lower Yangtze Mandarin has been significantly influenced by Wu Chinese.\n* Southwestern Mandarin (260 million), spoken in the provinces of Hubei, Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, and the Mandarin-speaking areas of Hunan, Guangxi and southern Shaanxi.[86] There are sharp phonological, lexical, and tonal changes, and intelligibility with Beijing is limited to varying degrees.[45][46]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe rhyming conventions of the new verse were codified in a rime dictionary called the *Zhongyuan Yinyun* (1324). A radical departure from the rime table tradition that had evolved over the previous centuries, this dictionary contains a wealth of information on the phonology of Old Mandarin. Further sources are the 'Phags-pa script based on the Tibetan alphabet, which was used to write several of the languages of the Mongol empire, including Chinese and the *Menggu Ziyun*, a rime dictionary based on 'Phags-pa. The rime books differ in some details, but overall show many of the features characteristic of modern Mandarin dialects, such as the reduction and disappearance of final plosives and the reorganization of the Middle Chinese tones.[16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe *Atlas* also includes several unclassified Mandarin dialects spoken in scattered pockets across southeastern China, such as Nanping in Fujian and Dongfang on Hainan.[87]\nAnother Mandarin variety of uncertain classification is apparently Gyami, recorded in the 19th century in the Tibetan foothills, who the Chinese apparently did not recognize as Chinese.[88]\nSome northwestern Mandarin varieties in the Qinghai\u2013Gansu sprachbund have undergone drastic changes in phonology, lexicon and grammar.[89]\n\n\n\n## Phonology[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Standard Chinese phonology\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

However, widespread resistance to the imposition of Hindi on non-native speakers, especially in South India (such as those in Tamil Nadu) led to the passage of the Official Languages Act of 1963, which provided for the continued use of English indefinitely for all official purposes, although the constitutional directive for the Union Government to encourage the spread of Hindi was retained and has strongly influenced its policies.[73]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n53. **^** Kesavan, B.

During the time of British rule, Hindi (in its religiously neutral, 'Hindustani' variety) increasingly came to be the symbol of national unity over against the English of the foreign oppressor. And Hindustani was learned widely throughout India, even in Bengal and the Dravidian south. ... Independence had been accompanied by the division of former British India into two countries, Pakistan and India. The former had been established as a Muslim state and had made Urdu, the Muslim variety of Hindi\u2013Urdu or Hindustani, its national language.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Hindi | Meaning | Portuguese\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| *an\u0101n\u0101s* (\u0905\u0928\u093e\u0928\u093e\u0938) | pineapple | anan\u00e1s\n |\n| *p\u0101dr\u012b* (\u092a\u093e\u0926\u094d\u0930\u0940) | priest | padre\n |\n| *b\u0101l\u1e6d\u012b* (\u092c\u093e\u0932\u094d\u091f\u0940) | bucket | balde\n |\n| *\u010d\u0101b\u012b* (\u091a\u093e\u092c\u0940) | key | chave\n |\n| *girj\u0101* (\u0917\u093f\u0930\u094d\u091c\u093e) | church | igreja\n |\n| *alm\u0101r\u012b* (\u0905\u0932\u092e\u093e\u0930\u0940) | cupboard | arm\u00e1rio\n |\n| *botal* (\u092c\u094b\u0924\u0932) | bottle | botelha\n |\n| *aspat\u0101l* (\u0905\u0938\u094d\u092a\u0924\u093e\u0932) | hospital | Hospital\n |\n| *olandez* (\u0913\u0932\u0902\u0926\u0947\u091c\u093c) | Dutch | holand\u00eas\n |\n\n\n## Media[edit]\n\n\n### Literature[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Hindi literature\n\nHindi literature is broadly divided into four prominent forms or styles, being *Bhakti* (devotional \u2013 Kabir, Raskhan); *\u015a\u1e5b\u1e47g\u0101r* (beauty \u2013 Keshav, Bihari); *V\u012bg\u0101th\u0101* (epic); and *\u0100dhunik* (modern).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n45. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Brief History of Hindi\". *Central Hindi Directorate*.
