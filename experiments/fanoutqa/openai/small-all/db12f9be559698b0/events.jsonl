It includes a list of all women who have served in the Senate, a list of current female senators, and a list of states represented by women in the Senate. The first female U.S. senator, Rebecca Latimer Felton, represented Georgia for a single day in 1922, and the first woman elected to the Senate, Hattie Caraway, was elected from Arkansas in 1932. Sixty women have served in the upper house of the United States Congress since its establishment in 1789. As of October 3, 2023, there are 25 women (15 Democrats, 9 Republicans, and 1 Independent) serving as U.S. senators.\n\n\nNancy Kassebaum is currently the oldest living former female member of the Senate at the age 91.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHistory of female representation in the US Senate\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| This article is part of a series on the |\n| United States Senate |\n| ![Great Seal of the United States Senate](image)Great Seal of the United States Senate |\n| History of the United States Senate |\n| \nMembers |\n| * Current members + (by seniority\n\t+ by class)\n* Former members\n* Hill committees + (DSCC\n\t+ NRSC)\n* Women in the Senate\n\n\n\n---\n\n* United States Vice President (list)\n* President pro tempore (list)\n* Presiding officer\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nClinton joined the Senate in 2001, becoming the first female senator from New York, and served until 2009, when she resigned to become the 67th United States Secretary of State, under President Barack Obama. She was replaced by Kirsten Gillibrand, who has been elected three times and was herself a candidate for president in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries.\n\n\nIn 2008, Kay Hagan became the first woman to unseat a female incumbent, Elizabeth Dole. Upon the opening of the 112th United States Congress in 2011, New Hampshire Democrat Jeanne Shaheen was joined by newly elected Republican Kelly Ayotte, making up the first Senate delegation of two women belonging to different parties.\n\n\nIn November 2022, Dianne Feinstein became the longest-serving female senator in history,[8] surpassing Barbara Mikulski,[9][10] having served for 30 years.[11] Feinstein was retiring at the end of her last term, scheduled for January 3, 2025,[12] but died on September 29, 2023, before her term ended.[13]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n15. **^** Ostermeier, Eric (July 27, 2017). \"Jacky Rosen's Historic 2018 US Senate Bid\". *Smart Politics*.

Until 1920, few women ran for the Senate. Until the 1990s, very few were elected. This paucity of women was due to many factors, including the lack of women's suffrage in many states until the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, women's limited access to higher education until the mid-1900s, public perceptions of gender roles, and barriers to women's advancement such as sex discrimination.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe first time two female senators from the same state served concurrently was beginning in 1993; Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer (both D-CA) were both elected in 1992, with Feinstein taking office that same year (as the result of a special election) and Boxer taking office in 1993; Boxer served until 2016, when she retired, and Feinstein was joined by Kamala Harris. In June 1993, Kay Bailey Hutchison won a special election in Texas, and joined Kassebaum as a fellow female Republican senator. These additions significantly diminished the popular perception of the Senate as an exclusive \"boys' club\". Since 1992, there has been at least one new woman elected to the Senate every two years, with the exception of 2004 (Lisa Murkowski was elected for the first time in 2004, but had been appointed to the seat since 2002). \n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn December 9, 2022, Sinema defected from the Democratic Party to become a registered independent, leaving 15 of her fellow women senators from her former party, and on January 3, 2023, Katie Britt, the first Republican woman senator from Alabama and also the first woman ever elected to the Senate from her state, began her term as well, increasing the number to 25 again. The death of Dianne Feinstein on September 29, 2023, brought the number back down to 24. The seating of Feinstein's replacement, appointed senator Laphonza Butler, on October 3 returned the figure to 25.\n\n\nAs of January 2023, four states (Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, and Washington) are represented by two female U.S. senators. Eleven incumbent women in the Senate are former U.S. representatives: Senators Stabenow, Cantwell, Gillibrand, Baldwin, Hirono, Moore Capito, Duckworth, Sinema, Rosen, Blackburn, and Lummis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSixty women have served in the United States Senate since its establishment in 1789.[17] Cumulatively, 36 female U.S. senators have been Democrats, while 23 have been Republicans and one is an independent. As of 2023, no female U.S. senator has ever won election to the House after her Senate term, resigned from a state governorship for the purpose of a Senate appointment by her successor, also won election as an independent or to represent more than one state in non-consecutive elections, served both seats of a state at different times, or represented a third party in her career. In December 2022, Senator Kyrsten Sinema became the first female senator to switch her party affiliation while in office. In September 2023, Senator Dianne Feinstein became the first female senator to die in office.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Year of the Woman\". *U.S. Senate*.\n2. **^** \"Jewesses in politics represent!\".

An example is Muriel Humphrey (D-MN), the widow of former senator and Vice President Hubert Humphrey; she was appointed to fill his seat until a special election was held (in which she did not run). However, with the election of three women in 2000, the balance shifted; more women have now entered service as a senator by winning elections than by being appointed.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| ![Sen.

Until 1920, few women ran for the Senate. Until the 1990s, very few were elected. This paucity of women was due to many factors, including the lack of women's suffrage in many states until the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, women's limited access to higher education until the mid-1900s, public perceptions of gender roles, and barriers to women's advancement such as sex discrimination.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe first time two female senators from the same state served concurrently was beginning in 1993; Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer (both D-CA) were both elected in 1992, with Feinstein taking office that same year (as the result of a special election) and Boxer taking office in 1993; Boxer served until 2016, when she retired, and Feinstein was joined by Kamala Harris.

These additions significantly diminished the popular perception of the Senate as an exclusive \"boys' club\". Since 1992, there has been at least one new woman elected to the Senate every two years, with the exception of 2004 (Lisa Murkowski was elected for the first time in 2004, but had been appointed to the seat since 2002). \n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn December 9, 2022, Sinema defected from the Democratic Party to become a registered independent, leaving 15 of her fellow women senators from her former party, and on January 3, 2023, Katie Britt, the first Republican woman senator from Alabama and also the first woman ever elected to the Senate from her state, began her term as well, increasing the number to 25 again. The death of Dianne Feinstein on September 29, 2023, brought the number back down to 24. The seating of Feinstein's replacement, appointed senator Laphonza Butler, on October 3 returned the figure to 25.\n\n\nAs of January 2023, four states (Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, and Washington) are represented by two female U.S. senators. Eleven incumbent women in the Senate are former U.S. representatives: Senators Stabenow, Cantwell, Gillibrand, Baldwin, Hirono, Moore Capito, Duckworth, Sinema, Rosen, Blackburn, and Lummis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSixty women have served in the United States Senate since its establishment in 1789.[17] Cumulatively, 36 female U.S. senators have been Democrats, while 23 have been Republicans and one is an independent. As of 2023, no female U.S. senator has ever won election to the House after her Senate term, resigned from a state governorship for the purpose of a Senate appointment by her successor, also won election as an independent or to represent more than one state in non-consecutive elections, served both seats of a state at different times, or represented a third party in her career. In December 2022, Senator Kyrsten Sinema became the first female senator to switch her party affiliation while in office. In September 2023, Senator Dianne Feinstein became the first female senator to die in office.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Year of the Woman\". *U.S. Senate*.\n2. **^** \"Jewesses in politics represent!\".

After retiring from the Senate, she married former senator Howard Baker (R-TN). Kassebaum has the distinction of being the first female elected senator who did not succeed her husband in Congress (Margaret Chase Smith was only elected to the Senate after succeeding her husband to his House seat).\n\n\nAmong the women elected or appointed in Senate history, by stature, Barbara Boxer (D-CA) and Barbara Mikulski (D-MD) are the shortest, at 4 feet 11 inches (1.50 m), whereas Kelly Loeffler (R-GA) is the tallest, at 5 feet 11 inches (1.80 m).[18][19][20]\n\n\n\n## List of female U.S. senators[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | Shelley Moore Capito | Republican | West Virginia House of Delegates, U.S. House of Representatives\n | 2015\n(age 62)\n | 1953\n |\n| 1\n | Wisconsin\n | Tammy Baldwin | Democratic | Wisconsin State Assembly, U.S. House of Representatives\n | 2013\n(age 51)\n | 1962\n |\n| 2\n | Wyoming\n | Cynthia Lummis | Republican | Wyoming House of Representatives, Wyoming Senate, Wyoming Treasurer, U.S. House of Representatives\n | 2021\n(age 66)\n | 1954\n |\n\n\n## List of states represented by women[edit]\n\n\nThirty-three states have been represented by female senators.

An example is Muriel Humphrey (D-MN), the widow of former senator and Vice President Hubert Humphrey; she was appointed to fill his seat until a special election was held (in which she did not run). However, with the election of three women in 2000, the balance shifted; more women have now entered service as a senator by winning elections than by being appointed.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| ![Sen.

In 1990, there were still few women in the Senate as compared to the number of women in the House.
