It was animated by Studio Ghibli for Tokuma Shoten, Yamato Transport and the Nippon Television Network, and stars the voices of Minami Takayama, Rei Sakuma and Kappei Yamaguchi.

While there are overt differences in demeanor between Kiki and San from *Princess Mononoke*, a character who is motivated by anger, both characters take control over their own lives. This theme of remarkable independence is also seen in Miyazaki's earlier works, such as in Nausicaä in *Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind*.[17] Kiki is also compared to Chihiro of *Spirited Away* as they are both young girls attempting to seek independence without being rebellious. Both Chihiro and Kiki develop their independence with the help of their friends.[18]\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n|  |\n| Directed by | Hayao Miyazaki |\n| Screenplay by | Hayao Miyazaki |\n| Based on | *Kiki's Delivery Service*by Eiko Kadono |\n| Produced by | Hayao Miyazaki |\n| Starring | * Minami Takayama\n* Rei Sakuma\n* Kappei Yamaguchi\n* Keiko Toda\n |\n| Cinematography | Shigeo Sugimura |\n| Edited by | Takeshi Seyama |\n| Music by | Joe Hisaishi |\n| Productioncompany\n | Studio Ghibli\n |\n| Distributed by | Toei Company |\n| Release date\n | * July 29, 1989 (1989-07-29)\n |\n| Running time\n | 102 minutes |\n| Country | Japan |\n| Language | Japanese |\n| Budget | ¥800 million ($6.9 million) |\n| Box office | $41.8 million[note 1] |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n1989 Japanese animated film\n\nThis article is about the anime film.

She opens a business delivering goods by broomstick—the \"Witch Delivery Service\". Her first delivery goes poorly; she is caught in the wind and loses the black cat toy she is supposed to deliver. Jiji pretends to be the toy until Kiki can retrieve the real item. She finds it in the home of a young painter, Ursula, who repairs and returns it to Kiki so she can complete the delivery and rescue Jiji.\n\n\nKiki accepts a party invitation from Tombo, but is delayed by her work and, exhausted, falls ill. When she recovers, Osono clandestinely arranges for Kiki to see Tombo again by assigning her a delivery addressed to him. After Kiki apologizes for missing the party, Tombo takes her for a test ride on the flying machine he is working on fashioned from a bicycle. Kiki warms up to Tombo but is intimidated by his friends, so she walks home.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nKiki becomes depressed and discovers she can no longer understand Jiji, who has befriended a pretty white cat named Lilly. She has also lost her flying ability and is forced to suspend her delivery business. Kiki has a surprise visit from Ursula, who determines that Kiki's crisis is a form of artist's block. Ursula suggests that if Kiki can find a new purpose, she will regain her powers.\n\n\nWhile Kiki is visiting a customer, she witnesses an airship accident on television. A strong gust leaves Tombo hanging from a rope in mid-air. Kiki regains her flying power and manages to rescue him. She recovers her confidence, resumes her delivery service, and writes a letter home saying that she and Jiji are happy.\n\n\n\n## Voice cast[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Yamanaka, Hiroshi (2008), \"The Utopian 'Power to Live': The Significance of the Miyazaki Phenomenon\", in Mark Wheeler Macwilliams (ed.), *Japanese Visual Culture: Explorations in the World of Manga and Anime*, M.E.

It was at this time that Miyazaki revealed that he had decided to direct the film, because he had influenced the project so much.[25] *Kiki's Delivery Service* was originally intended to be a 60-minute special, but expanded into a feature film running 102 minutes after Miyazaki completed storyboarding and scripting it.[28]\n\n\nThe word *takkyūbin* (宅急便, literally \"home-fast-mail\") in the Japanese title is a trademark of Yamato Transport (which stylized it in non-Japanese languages as *TA-Q-BIN*), though it is used today as a synonym for *takuhaibin* (宅配便, \"home-delivery-mail\"). While Yamato Transport sponsored the film, it initially did not approve of the usage of its trademark, since it was used by Kadano without permission. However, the success of the film restored relations between both her and Yamato Transport.[29][21]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n51. **^** \"A Magical Journey: Kiki's Delivery Service Blu-Ray Review\".

Miyazaki began significantly modifying the story, creating new ideas and changing existing ones.[25] *Majo no Takkyūbin*, the original children's book by Kadono that the movie was based on, is very different from Miyazaki's finished film. Kadono's novel is more episodic, consisting of small stories about various people and incidents Kiki encounters while making deliveries. Kiki overcomes many challenges in the novel based on \"her good heart\" and consequently expands her circle of friends. She faces no particular traumas or crises.[26] Many of the more dramatic elements, such as Kiki getting attacked by many crows, losing her powers or the airship incident at the film's climax, are not present in the original story. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Kiki and Jiji (sitting on Kiki's back) flying by the clock tower in Koriko just after arriving. According to Helen McCarthy, the \"vibrant\" Stockholm-inspired city gives a sense of safety as well as independence.[4][5]\nA major theme of the film is maturity.[6] After leaving her parents who are supportive of her independence, Kiki has to face problems common to adolescence such as finding a job, seeking acceptance, and taking care of herself.[7] The concept of vulnerability is also examined closely in the film. Critic Mark Schilling notes a scene during Kiki's first night away from home where Kiki rushes back to her room and slams the door behind her to avoid being spotted by Fukuo. Fukuo, however, steps outside simply to stretch his arms, and Kiki's bizarrely shy behavior \"expresses [her] youth, vulnerability, and isolation.\"[8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn order to more clearly illustrate the themes of struggling with independence and growing up in the film, Miyazaki intended to have Kiki face tougher challenges and create a more potent sense of loneliness.[26] One such challenge is Kiki's sudden loss of ability to fly. This event is only loosely paralleled in the novel, in which Kiki's broom breaks and merely requires her to fix it.[8] Miyazaki remarked, \"As movies always create a more realistic feeling, Kiki will suffer stronger setbacks and loneliness than in the original\".[8] Kadono was unhappy with the changes made between the book and film, to the point that the project was in danger of being shelved at the screenplay stage.[27] Miyazaki and Toshio Suzuki, the producer of Ghibli, went to the author's home and invited her to the film's studio. After her visit to the studio, Kadono decided to let the project continue.[21]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAt the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 98% of 43 reviews are positive for *Kiki's Delivery Service*, and the average rating is 8.1/10. The critics consensus reads, \"*Kiki's Delivery Service* is a heartwarming, gorgeously-rendered tale of a young witch discovering her place in the world.\"[57] Metacritic, another aggregator, collected 15 reviews and calculated an average rating of 85 out of 100, signifying \"universal acclaim\".[58] On September 4, 1998, *Entertainment Weekly* rated it as Video of the Year, and on September 12, 1998, it was the first video release to be reviewed as a normal film on *Siskel and Ebert* rather than on the \"Video Pick of the Week\" section.[43] Gene Siskel of the *Chicago Tribune* and Roger Ebert of the *Chicago Sun-Times* gave it \"two thumbs up\"[59][60] and Ebert went on to rank it as one of the best animated films released in the U.S. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nKiki's loss of her witch powers is considered the worst crisis she has to face during the film.[10][11] Her loss of flight reflects the harm dealt to Kiki by her own self-doubts.[10][12] This hardship causes Kiki to realize that being vulnerable does not always lead to failure and can help her learn valuable lessons to better understand herself.[12] Petrana Radulovic also suggests that Jiji's bond with Kiki represents the experiences she had as a child, and that once Kiki loses her powers to talk to Jiji, she becomes more lonely.[13] Jiji had served as the wiser voice (imaginary companion) to Kiki, and she stopped being able to understand him the moment she struggles with self-doubt. According to Miyazaki himself, Jiji is meant to represent the immature side of Kiki, and her inability to talk to Jiji represents her newfound maturity at the end of the movie.[14]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn relation to Kiki's portrayal as a witch, some have drawn comparisons to historical or contemporary views on witches and witchcraft. The film incorporates some conventions from fairy-tales such as a black cat companion for Kiki,[15] Kiki's use of a broom for flight, and her black dress.[16] While girls with magical powers are common in Japanese television, Miyazaki noted that, \"the witchcraft has always merely been the means to fulfill the dreams of young girls. They have always become idols with no difficulties.\" In contrast, Kiki cannot use her powers as a means of wish fulfillment.[1]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFor the 1997 Disney English dub, much of the soundtrack was kept except for \"Message of Rouge\" and \"Wrapped in Kindness\", which were the opening and ending themes of the original Japanese version. Instead, they were replaced with two songs by Sydney Taylor; \"Soaring\" and \"I'm Gonna Fly\". Both these songs were removed from the 2010 DVD re-release of the English dub of *Kiki's Delivery Service*.[33] Paul Chihara composed the music for the dub, adding music to scenes that were silent in the original Japanese version.[34]\n\n\n\n\n\nMusic releases for *Kiki's Delivery Service* [32]\n| Release date\n | English title\n | Japanese title\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| April 10, 1989\n | *Kiki's Delivery Service Image Album* | 魔女の宅急便 イメージソング集\n |\n| August 25, 1989\n | *Kiki's Delivery Service Soundtrack* | 魔女の宅急便 サウンドトラック\n |\n| December 21, 1989\n | *Kiki's Delivery Service Hi-Tech Series* | 魔女の宅急便 ハイテックシリーズ\n |\n| November 25, 1992\n | *Kiki's Delivery Service Vocal Album* | 魔女の宅急便 ヴォーカルアルバム\n |\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the original Japanese script, Kiki loses her ability to communicate with Jiji permanently, but the American version adds a line that implies that she is once again able to understand him at the end of the film.[54] More minor changes to appeal to the different teenage habits of the day include Kiki drinking hot chocolate instead of coffee and referring to \"cute boys\" instead of to \"the disco\".[55]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n*Kiki's Delivery Service* premiered on July 29, 1989, in Japanese theaters. It sold around 2,640,000 tickets in Japan,[35][36] with a total box office of ¥4.3 billion (US$31 million) in gross receipts.[37] It was become the first Studio Ghibli film to be successful during its initial release and was one of 1989's highest-grossing films in Japan.[35][38] It also grossed HK$4.04 million (US$519,000) in Hong Kong upon release there in 1990.[3] Later re-releases and international releases between 2004 and 2023 grossed US$10,366,082 worldwide,[39] adding up to $41,885,082 grossed worldwide as of 2023[update].[note 1] In the United Kingdom, it was 2018's seventh best-selling foreign-language film on home video,[40] and 2019's fifth best-selling foreign-language film (below four other Japanese films, including three Miyazaki anime films).[41]\n\n\n\n### English dubs[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1987, Group Fudosha asked Kadono's publishers for the rights to the novel to be made into a film by either Hayao Miyazaki or Isao Takahata. Production began near the release of *My Neighbor Totoro* (1988). Miyazaki initially worked as producer, but took over directing from Sunao Katabuchi as he became more involved in the project. As the novel is based on a fictional northern European country, Miyazaki and his team traveled to locations such as Visby, Sweden, to research its landscape. Miyazaki altered the story, adding new scenes to emphasize the theme of independence and growing up. According to Miyazaki, the film portrays the gulf between independence and reliance among teenage Japanese girls.[1]\n\n\n*Kiki's Delivery Service* was released in Japan on July 29, 1989, by the Toei Company.[2] It was the first Studio Ghibli film to be successful on initial release, grossing a total of ¥4.3 billion ($31 million). It received critical acclaim and multiple awards. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDisney produced an English dub in 1997,[34] and *Kiki* was the first film released through a deal Disney made with Tokuma.[36] It premiered at the Seattle International Film Festival on May 23, 1998, and was released on both VHS and Laserdisc by Buena Vista Home Video in September 1998.[3][33] It became the eighth-most sold film on Blockbuster during its first week of availability,[43] and sold over 900,000 copies by September 28, 1998.[44] It was released on home media in North America on 2003, alongside the releases of *Spirited Away* and *Castle in the Sky*.[45] In the United Kingdom, the film was released on Blu-ray by StudioCanal alongside a release of *Grave of the Fireflies* on July 1, 2013,[46] while in North America, Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released the film on Blu-ray Disc alongside *Princess Mononoke* and *The Wind Rises*, on November 18, 2014.[47] GKIDS re-issued the film on Blu-ray and DVD on October 17, 2017.[48] In 2020, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe first official English dub of *Kiki's Delivery Service* was produced by Carl Macek of Streamline Pictures, who previously dubbed *Castle in the Sky* and *My Neighbor Totoro* at the request of Tokuma Shoten for Japan Airlines' international flights. Tokuma was satisfied with the dub of *My Neighbor Totoro*, which allowed Carl to work on the dub of *Kiki's Delivery Service* in November 1989.[42] This dub is available only in the Ghibli Laserdisc Box Set.[21]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe film had a production budget of ¥800 million ($6.9 million), making it one of the most expensive anime films up until then, along with *Akira* (1988)[30] and *Royal Space Force: The Wings of Honnêamise* (1987).[31]\n\n\n\n## Music[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Kiki's Delivery Service |\n| --- |\n| Soundtrack album by Joe Hisaishi\n |\n| Released | August 25, 1989 |\n| Genre | * Anime music\n* Film score\n |\n| Length | 41:45 |\n| Label | Tokuma Shoten |\n| Producer | Joe Hisaishi |\n| Joe Hisaishi chronology |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| *The Inners*(1989)\n | ***Kiki's Delivery Service***(1989)\n | *Pretender*(1989)\n |\n\n |\n\n\nAs with Hayao Miyazaki's other films, Joe Hisaishi composed the soundtrack for this film.

August 24, 2007.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAnimism is a major theme in *My Neighbor Totoro*, according to Eriko Ogihara-Schuck.[4] Totoro has animistic traits and has *kami* status because he lives in a camphor tree in a Shinto shrine surrounded by a Shinto rope, and he is referred to as *mori no nushi* (master of the forest).[4] Ogihara-Schuck writes that when Mei returns from her encounter with Totoro, her father takes Mei and her sister to the shrine to greet and thank Totoro. This is a common practice in the Shinto tradition following an encounter with a *kami*.[4] According to Phillip E. Wegner, the film is an example of alternative history, citing the utopian-like setting of the anime.[5]\n\n\n\n## Voice cast[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter working on *3000 Miles in Search of a Mother*, Miyazaki wanted to make a \"delightful, wonderful film\" that would be set in Japan with the idea to \"entertain and touch its viewers, but stay with them long after they have left the theaters\".[6] Initially, Miyazaki had the main characters Totoro, Mei, Tatsuo, and Kanta.[6]: 8 The director based Mei on his niece,[8] and Totoros as \"serene, carefree creatures\" that were \"supposedly the forest keeper, but that's only a half-baked idea, a rough approximation\".[6]: 5, 103\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Character name\n | Japanese voice actor[6]: 175 | English voice actor(Tokuma/Streamline/50th Street Films, 1989/1993)[7] | English voice actor(Walt Disney Home Entertainment, 2005)[7] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Satsuki Kusakabe (草壁 サツキ) (10-year-old daughter) | Noriko Hidaka | Lisa Michelson | Dakota Fanning |\n| Mei Kusakabe (草壁 メイ) (4-year-old daughter) | Chika Sakamoto | Cheryl Chase | Elle Fanning |\n| Tatsuo Kusakabe (草壁 タツオ) (father) | Shigesato Itoi | Greg Snegoff | Tim Daly |\n| Yasuko Kusakabe (草壁 靖子) (mother) | Sumi Shimamoto | Alexandra Kenworthy | Lea Salonga |\n| Totoro (トトロ) | Hitoshi Takagi | — | Frank Welker |\n| Kanta Ōgaki (大垣 勘太) (a local boy) | Toshiyuki Amagasa | Kenneth Hartman | Paul Butcher |\n| Granny (祖母) (Nanny in the 1993 dub) | Tanie Kitabayashi | Natalie Core | Pat Carroll |\n| Catbus (ネコバス, **Nekobasu**) | Naoki Tatsuta | Carl Macek (uncredited) | Frank Welker |\n| Michiko (ミチ子) | Chie Kōjiro | Brianne Siddall (uncredited) | Ashley Rose Orr\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAccording to the environmental journal *Ambio*, *My Neighbor Totoro* \"has served as a powerful force to focus the positive feelings that the Japanese people have for *satoyama* and traditional village life\". The film's central character Totoro was used as a mascot by the Japanese campaign \"Totoro Hometown Fund Campaign\", which aimed to preserve areas of *satoyama* in Saitama Prefecture.[84] The fund, started in 1990 after the film's release, held an auction in August 2008 at Pixar Animation Studios to sell over 210 original paintings, illustrations, and sculptures inspired by *My Neighbor Totoro*.[85]\n\n\nMiyazaki additionally uses Totoro as a part of his logo for Studio Ghibli.[1] Totoro also makes a cameo appearance in the Pixar film *Toy Story 3* (2010)[86] but was not included in *Toy Story 4* due to licensing problems.[87] *Toy Story 3*'s art director Daisuke Tsutsumi is married to Miyazaki's niece, who inspired the character Mei in *My Neighbor Totoro*.[8]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n*My Neighbor Totoro* received numerous awards, including the Animage Anime Grand Prix prize, the Mainichi Film Award, and Kinema Junpo Award for Best Film in 1988. It also received the Special Award at the Blue Ribbon Awards in the same year. The film is considered as one of the top animation films, ranking 41st in *Empire* magazine's \"The 100 Best Films of World Cinema\" in 2010 and the number-one animated film on the 2012 *Sight & Sound* critics' poll of all-time greatest films.[2][3] The film and its titular character have become cultural icons, and made multiple cameo appearances in other films. Totoro also serves as the mascot for Studio Ghibli and is recognized as one of the most popular characters in Japanese animation.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1950s Japan, university professor Tatsuo Kusakabe and his daughters Satsuki and Mei (approximately ten and four years old, respectively) move into an old house close to the hospital where the girls' mother, Yasuko, is recovering from a long-term illness. The house is inhabited by small, dark, dust-like house spirits called *susuwatari*, that can be seen when moving from bright places to dark ones.[note 1] The *susuwatari* leave to find another empty house. Mei discovers two small spirits that lead her into the hollow of a large camphor tree. She befriends a larger spirit, which identifies itself using a series of roars that she interprets as \"Totoro\". Mei thinks Totoro is the troll from her illustrated book *Three Billy Goats Gruff*. She falls asleep atop Totoro but when Satsuki finds her, she is on the ground. Despite many attempts, Mei cannot show her family Totoro's tree. Tatsuo comforts her, saying Totoro will reveal himself when he wants to.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWikimedia Commons has media related to My Neighbor Totoro.\n\n* *My Neighbor Totoro* (film) at Anime News Network's encyclopedia\n* *My Neighbor Totoro* at IMDb ![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\n* *My Neighbor Totoro* at Rotten Tomatoes\n* *Mei and the Kitten Bus* (2002) at IMDb ![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\n* Entry in The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction\n* Joe Hisaishi's Soundtrack for My Neighbor Totoro, book by Kunio Hara, 33-1/3 Japan Series, Bloomsbury, ISBN 9781501345128\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nHayao Miyazaki\n |\n| --- |\n| Films directedand written | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n1988 film by Hayao Miyazaki\n\nFor the play, see *My Neighbour Totoro* (play).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| My Neighbor Totoro |\n| --- |\n| ![An early version of Satsuki is near a bus stop on a rainy day holding her umbrella.

For example, ripples were designed with \"two colors of high-lighting and shading\" and the rain for *My Neighbor Totoro* was \"scratched in the cels\" and superimposed for it to convey a soft feel.[6]: 156 The animators stated one month was taken to create the tadpoles, which included four colors; the water for it was also blurred.[6]: 154\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n67. **^** \"My Neighbour Totoro - film review\". *www.standard.co.uk*.

Mei falls asleep on Satsuki's back and Totoro appears beside them, allowing Satsuki to see him for the first time. Totoro has only a leaf on his head for protection against the rain, prompting Satsuki to offer her umbrella to him. Delighted, he gives her a bundle of nuts and seeds in return. A giant, bus-shaped cat arrives; Totoro boards it and leaves. A few days after planting the seeds, the girls awaken at midnight to find Totoro and his fellow spirits engaged in a ceremonial dance around the planted seeds. They join in, causing the seeds to grow into an enormous tree. Totoro takes the girls for a ride on a magical flying top. In the morning, the tree is gone but the seeds have sprouted.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2004, Walt Disney Pictures produced a new English dub of *My Neighbor Totoro* to be released after the rights to the Streamline dub had expired. As is the case with Disney's other English dubs of Miyazaki films, the Disney version of *My Neighbor Totoro* has a star-heavy cast, including Dakota and Elle Fanning as Satsuki and Mei, Timothy Daly as Mr. Kusakabe, Pat Carroll as Granny, Lea Salonga as Mrs. Kusakabe, and Frank Welker as Totoro and Catbus. The songs for the new dub retain the translation as the earlier dub but are sung by Sonya Isaacs.[29] The Disney dub was directed by Rick Dempsey, a Disney executive in charge of the company's dubbing services,[30] and was written by Don and Cindy Hewitt, who had written other dubs for Studio Ghibli.[31]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n89. **^** I D S Oliveira; S Schaffer; P V Kvartalnov; E A Galoyan; I V Palko; A Weck-Heimann; P Geissler; H Ruhberg (2013). \"A new species of Eoperipatus (Onychophora) from Vietnam reveals novel morphological characters for the South-East Asian Peripatidae\". *Zoologischer Anzeiger - A Journal of Comparative Zoology*. **252** (4): 495–510. doi:10.1016/j.jcz.2013.01.001.\n90. **^** Miyazaki, Hayao (May 28, 1988). フィルムコミック となりのトトロ (1) [*Film Comic My Neighbour Totoro (1)*] (in Japanese).

The film stars the voices of Yōji Matsuda, Yuriko Ishida, Yūko Tanaka, Kaoru Kobayashi, Masahiko Nishimura, Tsunehiko Kamijo, Akihiro Miwa, Mitsuko Mori, and Hisaya Morishige.\n\n\n*Princess Mononoke* is set in the late Muromachi period of Japan (approximately 1336 to 1573 AD) and includes fantasy elements. The story follows a young Emishi prince named Ashitaka, and his involvement in a struggle between the gods (*kami*) of a forest and the humans who consume its resources. The film deals with themes of Shinto and environmentalism. The term *mononoke* (物の怪, or もののけ) is not a name, but a Japanese word for supernatural, shape-shifting beings that possess people and cause suffering, disease, or death.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nA central theme of *Princess Mononoke* is the environment.[28] The film centers on the adventure of Ashitaka as he journeys to the west to undo a fatal curse inflicted upon him by Nago, a boar turned into a demon by Eboshi.[29] Michelle J. Smith and Elizabeth Parsons said that the film \"makes heroes of outsiders in all identity politics categories and blurs the stereotypes that usually define such characters\". In the case of the deer god's destruction of the forest and Tataraba, Smith and Parsons said that the \"supernatural forces of destruction are unleashed by humans greedily consuming natural resources\".[30] They also characterized Eboshi as a businesswoman who has a desire to make money at the expense of the forest, and also cite Eboshi's intention to destroy the forest to mine the mountain \"embodies environmentalist evil\".[29] Deirdre M. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n1997 Japanese animated film directed by Hayao Miyazaki\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Princess Mononoke |\n| --- |\n| ![A young girl wearing an outfit has blood on her mouth and holds a mask and a knife along with a spear .

Based on the multiple points of view the film adopts, San and Lady Eboshi can simultaneously be viewed as heroic or villainous. San defends the forest and viewers empathize with her. But she also attacks innocent people, complicating how we evaluate her. Opposed to San, Eboshi tries to destroy the forest and could be considered a villain. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n26. **^** Miyazaki, Hayao (July 31, 1996). \"「もののけ姫」 企画書\" [Princess Mononoke Planning Memo]. *出発点* [*Starting Point*].

This writer's block prompted him to accept a request for the creation of the *On Your Mark* promotional music video for the Chage and Aska song of the same title. According to Toshio Suzuki, the diversion allowed Miyazaki to return for a fresh start on the creation of *Princess Mononoke*. In April 1995, supervising animator Masashi Ando devised the character designs from Miyazaki's storyboard. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Clements, Jonathan; McCarthy, Helen (2006). \"Princess Mononoke\". *The Anime Encyclopedia: A Guide to Japanese Animation since 1917*.

In a Tokyo Broadcasting System program, televised on November 26, 2013, Toshio Suzuki mentioned that Miyazaki had preferred *The Legend of Ashitaka* as the title while Suzuki himself favoured *Princess Mononoke*, though the former title was eventually reused for the first song on the soundtrack.[26][27]\n\n\n\n## Themes[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n73. **^** Gerow, Aaron (July 10, 1997). \"A Spirited Battle for Nature\". *Daily Yomiuri*. p. 9.\n74. **^** Klady, Leonard (January 29, 1998). \"Princess Mononoke\". *Variety*.

Lady Eboshi works for the survival of humankind and San for the survival of nature. But Miyazaki, through the character of Ashitaka, argues that we should accept a non-dualistic view of living, accepting that nature and humans coexist. Ashitaka acts as a healer, mediating between humanity and nature. Ashitaka's curse, obtained while defending his people from a demonized boar god, ultimately symbolizes the destructive force of life, forcing him to recognize the commonalities present in the conflict between industrialized society and nature. Ashitaka’s quest for a cure by the Great Forest Spirit symbolizes humanity’s quest to find a way to live on earth that accepts the interbeing of all of earth's creatures. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n19. **^** \"The Myth of Princess Mononoke and Miyazaki's vision\".

Novelist Ali Shaw has described Yakul as being more similar to a red Lechwe than an elk. Miyazaki called Ashitaka a \"melancholic boy who has a fate\" and stated that Ashitaka's curse \"is similar to the lives of people [at the time]\".[5] Ashitaka's English voice actor Billy Crudup stated that he liked Ashitaka as \"an unexpected hero. He's not your usual wild, brave guy. He's really just a young, earnest man who's trying to lead a valuable life and protect his village.\"\n* Yuriko Ishida voices San (サン), a young woman who was raised by the wolves and feels hatred for humans, but eventually comes to care for Ashitaka.

San and Lady Eboshi survive until film's end, defying the usual convention of good triumphing over evil with the antagonist defeated. Napier concluded that the resolution of the conflict is left ambiguous, implying that Lady Eboshi and San will be able to come to some sort of compromise. The ambiguity suggests that there are no true villains or heroes.[38]\n\n\n\n### Loss of innocence[edit]\n\n\nDan Jolin of *Empire* said that a potential theme could be that of lost innocence. Miyazaki attributes this to his experience of making his previous film, *Porco Rosso*, and the wars in the former Yugoslavia, which he cites as an example of mankind never learning, making it difficult for him to go back to making a film such as *Kiki's Delivery Service*, where he has been quoted as saying \"It felt like children were being born to this world without being blessed.

The idea for *Spirited Away* came about when he wanted to make a film for these friends. Miyazaki had previously directed films for small children and teenagers such as *My Neighbor Totoro* and *Kiki's Delivery Service*, but he had not created a film for ten-year-old girls. For inspiration, he read shōjo manga magazines like *Nakayoshi* and *Ribon* the girls had left at the cabin, but felt they only offered subjects on \"crushes\" and romance. When looking at his young friends, Miyazaki felt this was not what they \"held dear in their hearts\" and decided to produce the film about a young heroine whom they could look up to instead.[17]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe cast of the film consists of Daveigh Chase, Jason Marsden, Suzanne Pleshette (in her final film role before her death in January 2008), Michael Chiklis, Lauren Holly, Susan Egan, David Ogden Stiers and John Ratzenberger (a Pixar regular). Advertising was limited, with *Spirited Away* being mentioned in a small scrolling section of the film section of *Disney.com*; Disney had sidelined their official website for *Spirited Away*[32] and given the film a comparatively small promotional budget.[19] Marc Hairston argues that this was a justified response to Studio Ghibli's retention of the merchandising rights to the film and characters, which limited Disney's ability to properly market the film.[19]\n\n\n\n## Themes[edit]\n\n\n### Supernaturalism[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe major themes of *Spirited Away*, heavily influenced by Japanese Shinto-Buddhist folklore, centre on the protagonist, Chihiro, and her liminal journey through the realm of spirits. The central location of the film is a Japanese bathhouse where a great variety of Japanese folklore creatures, including kami, come to bathe. Miyazaki cites the solstice rituals when villagers call forth their local kami and invite them into their baths.[8] Chihiro also encounters kami of animals and plants. Miyazaki says of this:\n\n\n> In my grandparents' time, it was believed that kami existed everywhere – in trees, rivers, insects, wells, anything. My generation does not believe this, but I like the idea that we should all treasure everything because spirits might exist there, and we should treasure everything because there is a kind of life to everything.[8]\n> \n> \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n34. **^** Gomes, Paul. \"Lesson Plan – Spirited Away\" (PDF).

His third proposal, which ended up becoming *Spirited Away*, was more successful. The three stories revolved around a bathhouse that was inspired by one in Miyazaki's hometown. He thought the bathhouse was a mysterious place, and there was a small door next to one of the bathtubs in the bath house. Miyazaki was always curious about what was behind it, and he made up several stories about it, one of which inspired the bathhouse setting of *Spirited Away*.[17]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nJohn Lasseter, Pixar animator and a fan and friend of Miyazaki, would often sit with his staff and watch Miyazaki's work when encountering story problems. After seeing *Spirited Away* Lasseter was ecstatic.[32] Upon hearing his reaction to the film, Disney CEO Michael Eisner asked Lasseter if he would be interested in introducing *Spirited Away* to an American audience. Lasseter obliged by agreeing to serve as the executive producer for the English adaptation. Following this, several others began to join the project: *Beauty and the Beast* co-director Kirk Wise and *Aladdin* co-producer Donald W. Ernst joined Lasseter as director and producer of *Spirited Away*, respectively.[32] Screenwriters Cindy Davis Hewitt and Donald H. Hewitt penned the English-language dialogue, which they wrote in order to match the characters' original Japanese-language lip movements.[11]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Yoshioka, Shiro (2008). \"Heart of Japaneseness: History and Nostalgia in Hayao Miyazaki's Spirited Away\".

With a budget of US$19 million, production of *Spirited Away* began in 2000. Pixar animator John Lasseter, a fan and friend of Miyazaki, convinced Walt Disney Pictures to buy the film's North American distribution rights, and served as executive producer of its English-dubbed version.[10] Lasseter then hired Kirk Wise as director and Donald W.

With the use of more computers and programs such as Softimage 3D, the staff learned the software, but used the technology carefully so that it enhanced the story, instead of \"stealing the show\". Each character was mostly hand-drawn, with Miyazaki working alongside his animators to see they were getting it just right.[2] The biggest difficulty in making the film was to reduce its length. When production began, Miyazaki realized it would be more than three hours long if he made it according to his plot. He had to delete many scenes from the story, and tried to reduce the \"eye candy\" in the film because he wanted it to be simple. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n28. **^** \"晩夏(ひとりの季節)/いのちの名前 (The name of life/late summer)\".

In *Spirited Away*, two major instances of allusions to environmental issues have been noted. Pam Coats, for example, a Vice President of Walt Disney Feature Animation, describes Chihiro dealing with the \"stink spirit\", who, it turns out, is actually a river spirit but is so corrupted with filth that one couldn't tell what it was at first glance. It only became clean again when Chihiro pulled out a huge amount of trash, including car tires, garbage, and a bicycle. This alludes to human pollution of the environment, and how people can carelessly toss away things without thinking of the consequences and of where the trash will go.[46]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe museum made Miyazaki feel nostalgic, \"especially when I stand here alone in the evening, near closing time, and the sun is setting – tears well up in my eyes.\"[17] Another major inspiration was the Notoya Ryokan (能登谷旅館), a traditional Japanese inn located in Yamagata Prefecture, famous for its exquisite architecture and ornamental features.[20] While some guidebooks and articles claim that the old gold town of Jiufen in Taiwan served as an inspirational model for the film, Miyazaki has denied this.[21] The Dōgo Onsen is also often said to be a key inspiration for the *Spirited Away* onsen/bathhouse.[22]\n\n\nToshio Suzuki, the producer of the film, also cites European inspirations and influences in the production of *Spirited Away*. He specifically invokes the structure of the film as European-inspired due to Miyazaki's own influences by European films such as *The Snow Queen* and *The Shepherdess and the Chimney Sweep*.[23]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Music of *Spirited Away*\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Year\n | Award\n | Category\n | Recipient\n | Result\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2001\n | Animation Kobe | Theatrical Film Award | *Spirited Away* | Won\n |\n| Blue Ribbon Awards | Best Film | *Spirited Away* | Won\n |\n| 5th Japan Media Arts Festival | Grand Prize\n | *Spirited Away* | Won\n |\n| Mainichi Film Awards | Best Film | *Spirited Away* | Won\n |\n| Best Animated Film | *Spirited Away* | Won\n |\n| Best Director | Hayao Miyazaki | Won\n |\n| 2002\n | 25th Japan Academy Award | Best Film | *Spirited Away* | Won[117] |\n| Best Song\n | Youmi Kimura | Won[117] |\n| 52nd Berlin International Film Festival | Golden Bear | *Spirited Away* | Won[k][118] |\n| Cinekid Festival | Cinekid Film Award\n | *Spirited Away* | Won[l][119] |\n| 21st Hong Kong Film Awards | Best Asian Film\n | *Spirited Away* | Won[120] |\n| Tokyo Anime Award | Animation of the Year\n | *Spirited Away* | Won\n |\n| Best Art Direction\n | Yôji Takeshige [ja] | Won\n |\n| Best Character Design\n | Hayao Miyazaki\n | Won\n |\n| Best Director\n | Hayao Miyazaki\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA stage adaptation of *Spirited Away* was announced in February 2021 with a world premiere planned in Tokyo on 28 February 2022.
