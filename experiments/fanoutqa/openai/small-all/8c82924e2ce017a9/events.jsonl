Cecil B. DeMille (1932, 1947, 1949, 1952 and 1956) is in second place with five films and William Wyler (1942, 1946, 1959 and 1968) and James Cameron (1991, 1997, 2009 and 2022) are tied for third place with four films. D. W. Griffith (1915, 1916 and 1920), George Roy Hill (1966, 1969 and 1973) and the Russo brothers (2016, 2018 and 2019) all feature heavily with three films apiece. George Lucas directed two chart-toppers in 1977 and 1999, but also served in a strong creative capacity as a producer and writer in 1980, 1981, 1983, 1984 and 1989 as well. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFilms generate income from several revenue streams, including theatrical exhibition, home video, television broadcast rights, and merchandising. However, theatrical box-office earnings are the primary metric for trade publications in assessing the success of a film, mostly because of the availability of the data compared to sales figures for home video and broadcast rights, but also because of historical practice. Included on the list are charts of the top box-office earners (ranked by both the nominal and real value of their revenue), a chart of high-grossing films by calendar year, a timeline showing the transition of the highest-grossing film record, and a chart of the highest-grossing film franchises and series. All charts are ranked by international theatrical box-office performance where possible, excluding income derived from home video, broadcasting rights, and merchandise.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe following directors have also all directed two films on the chart: Frank Lloyd, King Vidor, Frank Capra, Michael Curtiz, Leo McCarey, Alfred Hitchcock, David Lean, Stanley Kubrick, Guy Hamilton, Mike Nichols, William Friedkin, Peter Jackson, Gore Verbinski, and Michael Bay; Mervyn LeRoy, Ken Annakin and Robert Wise are each represented by one solo credit and one shared credit, and John Ford co-directed two films. Disney films are usually co-directed and some directors have served on several winning teams: Wilfred Jackson, Hamilton Luske, Clyde Geronimi, David Hand, Ben Sharpsteen, Wolfgang Reitherman and Bill Roberts have all co-directed at least two films on the list. Only seven directors have topped the chart in consecutive years: McCarey (1944 and 1945), Nichols (1966 and 1967), Spielberg (1981 and 1982), Jackson (2002 and 2003), Verbinski (2006 and 2007) and the Russo brothers (2018 and 2019).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHigh-grossing films by year of release[47][48][49]\n| Year\n | Title\n | Worldwide gross\n | Budget\n | Reference(s)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1915 | *The Birth of a Nation* | $50,000,000–100,000,000$20,000,000+R ($5,200,000)R | $110,000 | [# 84][# 85][# 86] |\n| 1916 | *Intolerance* | $1,750,000R IN | $385,907 | [50][51] |\n| 1917 | *Cleopatra* | $500,000\\*R | $300,000 | [# 87][# 88] |\n| 1918 | *Mickey* | $8,000,000 | $250,000 | [# 89] |\n| 1919 | *The Miracle Man* | $3,000,000R | $120,000 | [# 90] |\n| 1920 | *Way Down East* | $5,000,000R ($4,000,000)R | $800,000 | [# 91][# 92] |\n| 1921 | *The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse* | $5,000,000R ($4,000,000)R | $600,000–800,000 | [# 93] |\n| 1922 | *Douglas Fairbanks in Robin Hood* | $2,500,000R | $930,042.78 | [# 94][# 95] |\n| 1923 | *The Covered Wagon* | $5,000,000R | $800,000 | [# 96][# 97] |\n| 1924 | *The Sea Hawk* | $3,000,000R | $700,000 | [# 96] |\n| 1925 | *The Big Parade* | $18,000,000–22,000,000R  ($6,131,000)R | $382,000 | [# 98][# 99][# 100] |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | [# 3] |\n| 2021[97] | *Avatar* | $2,847,397,339 ‡ | [# 1] |\n| *2022* | $2,923,706,026 ‡ |\n\n\nRDistributor rental.\n\n\n‡Includes revenue from re-releases.

Besides the *Star Wars* and *Superman* franchises, *James Bond* and *Godzilla* films are still being released periodically; all four are among the highest-grossing franchises. Some of the older films that held the record of highest-grossing film still have respectable grosses by today's standards, but no longer compete numerically against today's top-earners in an era of much higher individual ticket prices. When those prices are adjusted for inflation, however, then *Gone with the Wind*—which was the highest-grossing film outright for twenty-five years—is still the highest-grossing film of all time. All grosses on the list are expressed in U.S. dollars at their nominal value, except where stated otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n## Highest-grossing films[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBecause of release schedules—especially in the case of films released towards the end of the year—and different release patterns across the world, many films can do business in two or more calendar years; therefore the grosses documented here are not confined to just the year of release. Grosses are not limited to original theatrical runs either, with many older films often being re-released periodically so the figures represent all the business a film has done since its original release; a film's first-run gross is included in brackets after the total if known. Because of incomplete data it cannot be known for sure how much money some films have made and when they made it, but generally the chart chronicles the films from each year that went on to earn the most. In the cases where estimates conflict both films are recorded, and in cases where a film has moved into first place because of being re-released the previous record-holder is also retained.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t+ \"X-Men – Worldwide (Unadjusted)\". *Box Office Mojo*.

He said, \"The Russos have peculiarly little sense of visual pleasure, little sense of beauty, little sense of metaphor, little aptitude for texture or composition; their spectacular conceit is purely one of scale, which is why their finest moments are quiet and dramatic ones\".[200] Anthony Lane of *The New Yorker* gave the film a compromising review, finding it to be overdeveloped and overwrought, stating, \"The one thing you do need to know about *Avengers: Endgame* is that it runs for a little over three hours, and that you can easily duck out during the middle hour, do some shopping, and slip back into your seat for the climax.
