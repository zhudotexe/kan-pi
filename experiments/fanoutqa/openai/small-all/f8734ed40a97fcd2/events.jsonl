The series, which aired from September 19, 2005 to March 31, 2014, follows the main character, Ted Mosby, and his group of friends in New York City's Manhattan. As a framing device, Ted, in 2030, recounts to his son, Luke, and daughter, Penny, the events from September 2005 to May 2013 that led him to meet their mother. *How I Met Your Mother* was a joint production by Bays & Thomas Productions and 20th Century Fox Television, and syndicated by 20th Television (now Disney-ABC Domestic Television).\n\n\nThe series was loosely inspired by Thomas and Bays' friendship when they both lived in New York.[1] The vast majority of the episodes (196 out of 208) were directed by Pamela Fryman. The other directors were Rob Greenberg (7 episodes), Michael Shea (4 episodes), and Neil Patrick Harris (1 episode).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nKnown for its unique structure, humor, and incorporation of dramatic elements, *How I Met Your Mother* was popular throughout its run. It received positive reviews initially, but reception became more mixed as the seasons went on.[2][3][4] The show was nominated for 91 awards and received 21. In 2010, Alyson Hannigan won the People's Choice Award for Favorite TV Comedy Actress. In 2012, seven years after its premiere, the series won the People's Choice Award for Favorite Network TV Comedy, and Neil Patrick Harris won the award for Favorite TV Comedy Actor twice.\n\n\n\n\n## Premise[edit]\n\n\nThe series follows the adventures of Ted Mosby (played by Josh Radnor) and his love life as a single man. His stories are narrated by Bob Saget as Ted Mosby 25 years later as he tells them to his children.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n## External links[edit]\n\n\n**How I Met Your Mother** at Wikipedia's sister projects\n\n* ![](image)Media from Commons\n* ![](image)Quotations from Wikiquote\n* ![](image)Data from Wikidata\n\n* How I Met Your Mother at Curlie\n* *How I Met Your Mother* at IMDb ![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\n* *How I Met Your Dad* at IMDb ![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n*How I Met Your Mother*\n |\n| --- |\n| Episodes | * Season 1\n* 2\n* 3\n* 4\n* 5\n* 6\n* 7\n* 8\n* 9\n |\n| Characters | * Ted Mosby\n* Marshall Eriksen\n* Lily Aldrin\n* Barney Stinson\n* Robin Scherbatsky\n* Tracy McConnell\n |\n| Soundtracks | * \"Let's Go to the Mall\"\n* \"Sandcastles in the Sand\"\n* \"Nothing Suits Me Like a Suit\"\n* \"P.S.

Ted is based loosely on Bays, and Marshall and Lily are based loosely on Thomas and his wife.[5][6] Thomas' wife Rebecca was initially reluctant to have a character based on her but agreed if they could get Alyson Hannigan to play her. Hannigan was looking to do more comedy work and was available.[5] Josh Radnor and Jason Segel, who were cast as Ted and Marshall, respectively, were not well known, although Segel had been a cast member on the short-lived *Freaks and Geeks* and a recurring guest star on Judd Apatow's follow-up show, *Undeclared*. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n11. **^** Saget, Bob (April 4, 2014). \"How do you feel about the fact that Josh Radnor was still the older version of Ted on the series finale of HIMYM and not you?\". *Reddit*.

At the end of the fourth season only 88 episodes had been produced, and a further 22 episodes were required, ensuring that there would be a fifth season.[29] There also was a complication with the writing of the show because of actress Alyson Hannigan's absence due to her pregnancy; in response, the writers had to create episodes that did not include one of the five main characters.[30] On May 19, 2009, the fifth-season renewal was announced.[31] May 20, 2009, CBS announced that *How I Met Your Mother* would again be aired at 8 pm, leading into the new comedy *Accidentally on Purpose*. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe story goes into a flashback and starts in 2005 with Ted Mosby living in New York City and working as an architect. The narrative deals primarily with his best friends. These include the long-lasting couple Marshall Eriksen (Jason Segel), a law student and Lily Aldrin (Alyson Hannigan), a kindergarten teacher, who have been dating for almost nine years when Marshall proposes, as well as womanizing playboy Barney Stinson (Neil Patrick Harris), and Canadian news reporter Robin Scherbatsky (Cobie Smulders). All of the characters' lives are entwined. The series explores many storylines, including a \"will they or won't they\" relationship between Robin and each of the two single male friends, Marshall and Lily's relationship, and the ups and downs of the characters' careers.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Season | Episodes | Originally aired | Rank |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| First aired | Last aired |\n| 1 | 22 | September 19, 2005 (2005-09-19) | May 15, 2006 (2006-05-15) | 85 |\n| 2 | 22 | September 18, 2006 (2006-09-18) | May 14, 2007 (2007-05-14) | 61 |\n| 3 | 20 | September 24, 2007 (2007-09-24) | May 19, 2008 (2008-05-19) | 70 |\n| 4 | 24 | September 22, 2008 (2008-09-22) | May 18, 2009 (2009-05-18) | 49 |\n| 5 | 24 | September 21, 2009 (2009-09-21) | May 24, 2010 (2010-05-24) | 42 |\n| 6 | 24 | September 20, 2010 (2010-09-20) | May 16, 2011 (2011-05-16) | 48 |\n| 7 | 24 | September 19, 2011 (2011-09-19) | May 14, 2012 (2012-05-14) | 45 |\n| 8 | 24 | September 24, 2012 (2012-09-24) | May 13, 2013 (2013-05-13) | 42 |\n| 9 | 24 | September 23, 2013 (2013-09-23) | March 31, 2014 (2014-03-31) | 28 |\n\n\n\n\n\n### Season 1[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *How I Met Your Mother* (season 1)\n\nIn 2030, Ted Mosby (voiced by Bob Saget) sits his children down to tell them the story of how he met their mother.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n59. **^** Sepinwall, Alan. \"Season finale review: 'How I Met Your Mother' - 'The Magician's Code': Miss Direction\". *Hitfix*.

He tells the story of his adult years from his late twenties to his mid thirties, and all the obstacles he overcomes before he meets \"The One\" (the Mother). This story is told by the Older Ted Mosby, and narrator of the series, Bob Saget. Ted moved to New York City with his friends Marshall and Lily after graduating from Wesleyan University. In New York, he met Barney (at the urinal of MacLaren's) and Robin, to whom he was immediately attracted. Ted is on a quest for happiness and \"The One\", the woman he will marry. He has many relationships, one with Robin, that reveal the qualities he wants in his future wife. At the end of each relationship, with levity, he reflects on what went wrong. Although hope to find \"the one\" diminishes with each failed relationship, Ted does not give up. He has more elegant and higher-class interests than his friends. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n76. **^** Goodman, Jessica (September 19, 2014). \"'How I Met Your Mother' Pineapple Incident Mystery Is Finally Revealed\". *The Huffington Post*.

'Oh no, I have to actually perform. I have to do well, and I have to have a voice... and I have to have thoughts now.'\"[7]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### 2002–2016: Early roles and breakthrough[edit]\n\n\n![A brunette woman smiles](image)Smulders at a CBS event in 2008\nSmulders made her professional acting debut in 2002, with guest appearances in the UPN science fiction comedy series *Special Unit 2* and the Showtime science fiction drama series *Jeremiah*.

He is best known for portraying Ted Mosby on the Emmy Award–winning CBS sitcom *How I Met Your Mother*. He made his writing and directorial debut with the 2010 comedy drama film *Happythankyoumoreplease*, for which he won the Sundance Film Festival Audience Award and was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize.\n\n\nIn 2012, he wrote, directed and starred in his second film, *Liberal Arts*, which premiered at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival. In 2014, Radnor portrayed Isaac in the Broadway play *Disgraced*, which was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Play. He then starred as Dr. Jedediah Foster on the PBS American Civil War drama series *Mercy Street*, Lou Mazzuchelli in the musical series *Rise*, and as Lonny Flash in *Hunters*.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nRadnor was born in Columbus, Ohio to a Jewish family, the son of Carol Radnor (née Hirsch), a high school guidance counselor, and Alan Radnor, a medical malpractice lawyer.[2] Radnor has two sisters, Melanie Radnor Silverman and Joanna Radnor Vilensky.[3]\n\n\nHe grew up in Bexley, Ohio, a suburb of Columbus, and was raised in Conservative Judaism.[4] He attended the Orthodox Jewish day school Columbus Torah Academy before going to Bexley High School[5][6][7] and then Kenyon College, where his school's theater department presented him with the Paul Newman Award and during which he spent a semester (Spring 1995) training at the National Theater Institute at the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center in Waterford, Connecticut. He graduated from Kenyon with a Bachelor of Arts in drama in 1996.[8] Radnor received his Master of Fine Arts degree in acting from New York University's graduate acting program at the Tisch School of the Arts in 1999.[8][9] Radnor participated in an Israel experience program in Tzfat with Livnot U'Lehibanot in 1997.[5]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Radnor and Ben Lee performing\nRadnor was cast as the lead in The WB series *Off Centre*. However, the role was re-cast with Eddie Kaye Thomas before the first episode aired.[10] In 2002, he made his Broadway debut in the stage version of *The Graduate*, succeeding Jason Biggs, opposite Kathleen Turner and Alicia Silverstone. In 2004, Radnor starred in *The Paris Letter* alongside his future *How I Met Your Mother* co-star Neil Patrick Harris.[11] From 2005 to 2014, Radnor starred in *How I Met Your Mother*, his biggest role to date.\n\n\nIn July 2008, he starred opposite Jennifer Westfeldt in the premiere of the play *Finks*,[12] written by Joe Gilford and directed by Charlie Stratton for New York Stage and Film. Radnor made his directorial debut with the film *Happythankyoumoreplease*, where he was both the writer and star of the 2010 comedy-drama.[13]\nHis second directorial effort, *Liberal Arts*, starring himself and Elizabeth Olsen, premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 22, 2012.[14] Radnor appeared in the Broadway production of *Disgraced*, which opened October 23, 2014, at the Lyceum Theatre.[15][16] He is set to direct the sci-fi thriller film *The Leaves*.[17] Radnor is currently starring in the Amazon Prime series, *Hunters*, as Lonny Flash, and on Netflix's *Centaurworld*, as Durpleton.\n\n\nIn October 2016, Radnor also confirmed he is in a band, Radnor and Lee, with Australian musician Ben Lee. Radnor and Lee had known each other for \"twelve or thirteen years after meeting on the set of *How I Met Your Mother*\" eventually writing songs together.[18] Their debut album, *Radnor & Lee* was released on November 10, 2017,[19] \"receiving widespread praise across the board, and cementing the duo as an accomplished pair of artists,\" stated Rolling Stone.[20] On February 19, 2020, Spin announced Radnor and Lee's sophomore album, *Golden State*, out on Flower Moon Records, and premiered the first single \"Outside In.\"[21] American Songwriter later premiered the video for the album's 2nd single, \"Simple Harmony.\" Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the album's release date was pushed back to June 2020.[22]\n\n\nRadnor's debut solo EP, *One More Then I'll Let You Go,* was released on April 16, 2021, on Flower Moon Records. Rolling Stone premiered the first single, \"The High Road,\" March 10, 2021, calling it a \"gently lilting ballad about the breakdown of a friendship on which he sings... which features deep textures of piano, acoustic guitar, organ, and snapping fingers.\"[23] The EP's 2nd single, \"You Feel New,\" premiered on March 31, 2021, with features in Rolling Stone, NPR, American Songwriter and Paste Magazine.[24]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nIn 2008, Radnor told the *Los Angeles Times*, \"I do Transcendental Meditation, and part of the reason I chose my house is that I thought it would be a great place to meditate.\"[25]\n\n\nRadnor is an avid Cloud Cult fan. He collaborated with the band to make the film *The Seeker* in 2016. Radnor explained, \"What's true for me about a lot of music, but especially true for Cloud Cult's music, is that it stirs up the thing that's already in you and calls it out. If this film is able to do that, I'll sleep well at night.\"[26][27]\n\n\n\n## Filmography[edit]\n\n\n\n\nKey\n| †\n | Denotes productions that have not yet been released\n |\n\n\n### Film[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2001\n | *Not Another Teen Movie* | Tour Guide\n |  |\n| 2008\n | *The Negotiating Table* | WGA Negotiator\n | Short film\n |\n| 2010\n | *Happythankyoumoreplease* | Sam Wexler\n | Also director and writer\n |\n| 2012\n | *Liberal Arts* | Jesse Fisher\n | Also director, writer and producer\n |\n| 2013\n | *Afternoon Delight* | Jeff Boyardee\n |  |\n| 2013\n | *The Galapagos Affair: Satan Came to Eden* | John Garth (voice)\n | Documentary\n |\n| 2016\n | *The Seeker* | Father\n | Also executive producer\n |\n| 2018\n | *Social Animals* | Paul\n |  |\n| 2023\n | *Three Birthdays* | Rob\n |  |\n| 2023\n | *All Happy Families* |  |  |\n\n\n### Television[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2000\n | *Welcome to New York* | Doug\n | Episode: \"The Crier\"\n |\n| 2001\n | *Off Centre* | Mike Platt\n | Unaired pilot\n |\n| 2002\n | *Law & Order* | Robert Kitson\n | Episode: \"Access Nation\"\n |\n| 2002\n | *The Court* | Dylan Hirsch\n | 3 episodes\n |\n| 2003\n | *ER* | Keith\n | Episode: \"The Advocate\"\n |\n| 2003\n | *Six Feet Under* | Will Jaffe\n | Episode: \"The Trap\"\n |\n| 2003\n | *Miss Match* | Andrew Gilbert\n | Episode: \"I Got You Babe\"\n |\n| 2005\n | *Judging Amy* | Justin Barr\n | Episode: \"Too Little, Too Late\"\n |\n| 2005–14\n | *How I Met Your Mother* | Ted Mosby | Main role (208 episodes)\n |\n| 2007, 2009\n | *Family Guy* | Ted Mosby (voice)\n | Episodes: \"No Chris Left Behind\"\"Peter's Progress\"\n |\n| 2013\n | *Malviviendo* | Himself/cameo\n | Episode: \"La cosa está muy negra\"\n |\n| 2016–17\n | *Mercy Street* | Dr. Jedediah Foster\n | Main role (12 episodes)\n |\n| 2018\n | *Rise* | Lou Mazzuchelli\n | Main role (10 episodes)\n |\n| 2018\n | *Grey's Anatomy* | John\n | Episode: \"Momma Knows Best\"\n |\n| 2020–23\n | *Hunters* | Lonny Flash\n | Main role (18 episodes)\n |\n| 2021\n | *Centaurworld* | Durpleton (voice)\n | Main role (18 episodes)\n |\n| 2022\n | *Fleishman Is in Trouble* | Adam\n | Recurring\n |\n\n\n### Music videos[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year | Title | Artist | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2016 | \"Let Me Be Your Girl\" | Rachael Yamagata | Director[28] |\n| 2017 | \"Be Like the Being\" | Radnor and Lee | Director\n |\n| 2021 | \"Afternoon\" | Cinders | Director\n |\n\n\n### Stage[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Location\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2002\n | *The Graduate* | Benjamin Braddock\n | Plymouth Theatre[29] |\n| 2004\n | *The Paris Letter* | Sam Arlen / Young Sandy\n | Kirk Douglas Theater |\n| 2011\n | *She Loves Me* | Georg Nowack\n | Roundabout Theatre Company[29] |\n| 2014–2015\n | *Disgraced* | Isaac\n | Lyceum Theatre |\n| 2016\n | *The Babylon Line* | Aaron Port\n | Lincoln Center\n |\n| 2018\n | *Little Shop of Horrors* | Seymour Krelborn\n | Kennedy Center |\n\n\n## Awards and nominations[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Work\n | Award\n | Result\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2010\n | *Happythankyoumoreplease* | Sundance Film Festival Audience Award | Won\n |\n| Sundance Film Festival Grand Jury Award | Nominated\n |\n\n\n## Discography[edit]\n\n\n### Radnor and Lee[edit]\n\n\n* *Radnor and Lee* (2017, Gold Village Entertainment)\n* *Golden State* (2020, Flower Moon Records)\n\n\n### Solo[edit]\n\n\n* *One More Then I'll Let You Go* (2021, Flower Moon Records)\n\n\n* *Eulogy, Vol. 1* (2023, Optimal Grip)\n\n\n### Additional appearances[edit]\n\n\n* Paty Cantú & Josh Radnor – \"Mirame\" (2020, Universal Music Mexico)\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Happy birthday, Josh Radnor: See his star sign and read your horoscope\". *Hello!*.

The series revolved around a group of suburban Detroit high school students circa 1980. Segel personally composed a song for his character, Nick, to sing to the lead female character, Lindsay (Linda Cardellini).[20]\n\n\nSegel had recurring roles on *CSI: Crime Scene Investigation* as Neil Jansen and on *Undeclared* as Eric. He played Marshall Eriksen on the CBS sitcom *How I Met Your Mother*; he had previously stated he would move on to other projects in 2013 when his contract expired,[21] but was convinced to finish the series after its ninth season in 2014.[22]\n\n\nSegel made his film debut with *Can't Hardly Wait* in 1998. His other early feature film appearances include *Slackers*, *SLC Punk!*, *The Good Humor Man*, and *Dead Man on Campus*. In 2007, he appeared in *Knocked Up*, directed by *Freaks and Geeks* producer Judd Apatow. Segel starred in the lead role of 2008's *Forgetting Sarah Marshall*, a film he wrote and Apatow produced with Shauna Robertson for Universal Pictures. He also starred in *I Love You, Man*, which was released on March 20, 2009, by DreamWorks.[23]\n\n\nIn *Forgetting Sarah Marshall*, Segel's character writes a \"Dracula\" musical performed by puppets. He also appeared in the most prominent scene containing full frontal nudity in the film.[24] In an interview,[25] he stated that the Dracula musical with puppets, as well as being broken up with while naked, were real experiences he wrote into the movie. Those cloth creatures were custom-made by the Jim Henson Company, and the experience emboldened Segel to pitch his concept for a Muppets movie.[26] Segel performed a song from the film, \"Dracula's Lament\", on the 1000th episode of *The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson*.[27]\n\n\n\n![A man smiles as he waves](image)Segel at the Australian premiere of *The Muppets* in Sydney in 2011\nFor the 2010 comedy *Get Him to the Greek*, Segel co-wrote most of the soundtrack's music which was performed by the fictional celebrity singer, Aldous Snow, including Infant Sorrow. He also appeared on *The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson* and sang an original song entitled \"Wonky Eyed Girl\".[28]\n\n\nIn 2010, he voiced Gru's arch-rival Vector in the Universal's CGI animated film, *Despicable Me* and appeared as \"Horatio\" in a fantasy comedy film *Gulliver's Travels* directed by Rob Letterman and very loosely based on Part One of the 18th-century novel of the same name by Jonathan Swift. Segel appeared in *Bad Teacher*, starring Cameron Diaz, which opened in June 2011. He played gym teacher and thwarted suitor Russell Gettis.[29] Along with Nicholas Stoller, Segel approached Disney in 2007 to write the latest *Muppets* film. Disney was unsure on how to take the request, as Segel had just done frontal nudity in *Forgetting Sarah Marshall*, but after realizing that he was a fan, the project was approved. Segel stated that he wanted to do the film because the last film in the series to be released in theaters was *Muppets from Space* in 1999, and he felt that the younger generation was missing out on enjoying one of his childhood favorites.[30]\n\n\nSegel decided not to star in the sequel to *The Muppets*, *Muppets Most Wanted*.[31] He filmed *The Five-Year Engagement*, with Emily Blunt, in spring 2011, in Michigan, and the film was released on April 27, 2012.[32]\n\n\nIn 2013, Segel revealed he was working on a series of young adult novels, based on a story he conceived when he was 21.[33] In the fall of 2014, the first novel of the series *Nightmares!*, co-written with Kirsten Miller, was released, with the followup coming out the following year.[34][35]\n\n\nIn 2015, Segel received praise[36][37][38] for his portrayal of the late author David Foster Wallace in the independent biographical drama film *The End of the Tour*. For his performance, he earned an Independent Spirit Award nomination for Best Male Lead.[39]\n\n\nIn 2017, Segel and Miller released a new book, *Otherworld*, the first of a new young adult series. A second book in the series, *OtherEarth*, was released in 2018, and a third novel, *OtherLife*, in 2019. Segel created and starred in the American drama television series *Dispatches from Elsewhere*, which premiered on March 1, 2020, on AMC.\n\n\nIn 2019, Segel starred in *Our Friend* based on Matthew Teague's 2015 essay \"The Friend\".[40]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nSegel is an ordained minister with the Universal Life Church.[41] He performed a wedding ceremony on *The Tonight Show* on July 6, 2010, for a couple that solicited his services by placing pictures of him around his hometown and the bar he frequently visited.[42]\n\n\nSegel dated his *Freaks and Geeks* co-star Linda Cardellini for several years following the show's cancellation.[43] He dated Michelle Williams from 2012 to 2013.[44] From December 2013 to April 2021, Segel dated photographer Alexis Mixter.[45][46]\n\n\n\n## Filmography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Segel, Neil Patrick Harris and Joss Whedon in 2011\n### Film[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1998\n | *Can't Hardly Wait* | Matt\n |  |\n| 1998\n | *Dead Man on Campus* | Kyle\n |  |\n| 1998\n | *SLC Punk!* | Mike\n |  |\n| 2002\n | *Slackers* | Sam Schechter\n |  |\n| 2003\n | *11:14* | Leon (Paramedic #1)\n |  |\n| 2003\n | *Certainly Not a Fairytale* | Leo\n |  |\n| 2004\n | *LolliLove* | Jason\n |  |\n| 2005\n | *The Good Humor Man* | Smelly Bob\n |  |\n| 2006\n | *Bye Bye Benjamin* | Theodore Everest\n |  |\n| 2006\n | *Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny* | Frat Boy\n | Deleted scenes\n |\n| 2007\n | *Knocked Up* | Jason\n |  |\n| 2008\n | *Forgetting Sarah Marshall* | Peter Bretter\n | Also writer |\n| 2009\n | *I Love You, Man* | Sydney Fife\n |  |\n| 2010\n | *Despicable Me* | Victor \"Vector\" Perkins (voice)\n |  |\n| 2010\n | *Gulliver's Travels* | Horatio\n |  |\n| 2011\n | *Bad Teacher* | Russell Gettis\n |  |\n| 2011\n | *Friends with Benefits* | Brice\n | Uncredited cameo\n |\n| 2011\n | *Jeff, Who Lives at Home* | Jeff Thompkins\n |  |\n| 2011\n | *The Muppets* | Gary\n | Also writer and executive producer |\n| 2012\n | *The Five-Year Engagement* | Tom Solomon\n | Also writer and executive producer\n |\n| 2012\n | *This Is 40* | Jason\n |  |\n| 2013\n | *This Is the End* | Himself\n | Uncredited cameo\n |\n| 2014\n | *Sex Tape* | Jay Hargrove\n | Also writer and executive producer\n |\n| 2015\n | *The End of the Tour* | David Foster Wallace |  |\n| 2017\n | *The Discovery* | Will Harbor\n |  |\n| 2018\n | *Come Sunday* | Henry\n |  |\n| 2019\n | *Our Friend*[47] | Dane Faucheux\n |  |\n| 2022\n | *The Sky Is Everywhere*[48] | Big Walker\n |  |\n| 2022\n | *Windfall*[49] | Nobody\n | Also story writer and producer\n |\n\n\n### Television[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1999–2000\n | *Freaks and Geeks* | Nick Andopolis | Main role;

She is known for playing Tracy McConnell in the CBS sitcom *How I Met Your Mother* from 2013 to 2014, and for her work in theater productions such as *That Face*, *Stunning*, and the Tony Award-winning musical *Once*, for which she won a Grammy Award and was nominated for a Tony Award. She has also played Teresa Petrillo Belfort in the 2013 film *The Wolf of Wall Street*, Sarah Wilder in the 2020 film *Palm Springs*, Betsy Solverson in the second season of *Fargo* (2015), Hazel Green in the HBO Max comedy series *Made for Love* (2021–2022), and Emma in the Peacock black comedy mystery series *The Resort* (2022).\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nMilioti was born on August 16, 1985, in Cherry Hill, New Jersey.[1] She is of Italian descent, and calls her family \"Olive Garden Italian\".[2] In middle school, she found her love of acting at Long Lake Camp for the Arts in Long Lake, New York.[3] She graduated in 2003 from Cherry Hill High School East, where she began performing in school plays.[4] She took acting classes at New York University, but dropped out during her sophomore year.[5][6] Milioti admitted that she was \"wildly unhappy there\" and dropped out as a result.[5]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n![Milioti strumming a ukulele onstage](image)Milioti playing ukulele in 2013.\nMilioti's first acting roles were bit parts in national advertising campaign ads, notably one for the Ford Edge.[7] She also appeared in television programs such as *The Sopranos* and films such as *Greetings from the Shore*. Milioti is also known for her stage performances. In 2007, she appeared on Broadway as Alice Ashbrook in Helen Edmundson's award-winning adaptation of Jamila Gavin's novel *Coram Boy*.[8] In 2010, she starred in *That Face*,[9] and was nominated for a Lucille Lortel Award for Outstanding Lead Actress for her work in *Stunning*.[10]\n\n\nIn 2012, she received a Tony Award nomination for Best Actress in a Musical for her portrayal of Girl in *Once*, a musical in which she performed from 2011 to 2013.[11] Of her performance, Ben Brantley of the *New York Times* wrote: \"It’s not easy playing a winsome life force with a foreign accent. But Ms. Milioti has mastered the assignment brilliantly. She brings a new confidence to her portrayal, and an enhanced mixture of wit and wisdom, which suggests a maturity in youth, a fatalism hard won during an Eastern European childhood. And together she and Mr. Kazee exude a chemistry that is all the more achingly real for being so subdued.\"[12] Her *Once* performance, with fellow principal soloist Steve Kazee, earned the 2013 Grammy Award for Best Musical Theater Album. She also read aloud a short story for the 2011 *This American Life* episode \"Adventure\".[13] In 2012, she appeared on several songs of Glen Hansard's debut album *Rhythm and Repose*.\n\n\nIn 2013, Milioti was cast in the CBS sitcom *How I Met Your Mother* as the titular Mother, appearing for the first time in the season eight finale titled \"Something New\", and was promoted to a series regular for the show's ninth and final season.[14] Milioti portrayed Jordan Belfort's first wife, Teresa Petrillo, in the 2013 Martin Scorsese film *The Wolf of Wall Street*.[15] In February 2014, she was cast as Zelda, the female lead on NBC's comedy *A to Z* which premiered that October and aired for one season of 13 episodes.[16] In 2015, she co-starred on the second season of *FX's Fargo* as Betsy Solverson, the cancer-stricken wife of state trooper Lou Solverson and mother of future deputy Molly Solverson. In 2017, Milioti appeared in the fourth season of the sci-fi anthology show *Black Mirror* in the episode \"USS Callister\" as Nanette Cole, a newly employed game developer whose digital recreation becomes trapped in a virtual simulator game.[17]\n\n\nIn 2020, Milioti starred in the sci-fi/comedy *Palm Springs*, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January and on Hulu in July.[18] In 2021, she starred in the HBO Max dark comedy series *Made for Love* as the entrapped wife of a tech billionaire from whom she runs away.[19]\n\n\nIn 2024, Milioti is set to star as Sofia Falcone in the Max spin-off miniseries of *The Batman* titled *The Penguin*, opposite Colin Farrell.[20][21]\n\n\n\n## Acting credits[edit]\n\n\n### Film[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2007\n | *Greetings from the Shore* | Didi\n |  |\n| 2009\n | *Year of the Carnivore* | Sammy Smalls\n |  |\n| 2012\n | *Sleepwalk with Me* | Janet Pandamiglio\n |  |\n| *I Am Ben* | The Journalist\n |  |\n| *The Brass Teapot* | Brandi\n |  |\n| 2013\n | *Bert and Arnie's Guide to Friendship* | Faye\n |  |\n| *The Wolf of Wall Street* | Teresa Petrillo Belfort\n |  |\n| 2014\n | *The Occupants* | Lucy\n |  |\n| 2015\n | *It Had to Be You* | Sonia\n |  |\n| 2017\n | *Breakable You* | Maud Weller\n |  |\n| 2020\n | *Palm Springs* | Sarah Wilder\n |  |\n\n\n### Television[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2006\n | *3 lbs* | Megan Rafferty\n | Episode: \"Bad Boys\"\n |\n| 2006–2007\n | *The Sopranos* | Catherine Sacrimoni | 3 episodes\n |\n| 2009\n | *The Unusuals* | Sketch Artist\n | 2 episodes\n |\n| 2010\n | *The Good Wife* | Onya Eggertson\n | Episode: \"Taking Control\"\n |\n| 2011\n | *30 Rock* | Abby Flynn/Abby Grossman\n | Episode: \"TGS Hates Women\"\n |\n| *Nurse Jackie* | Monica\n | Episode: \"...Deaf Blind Tumor Pee-Test\"\n |\n| 2013–2014\n | *How I Met Your Mother* | Tracy McConnell / The Mother | Guest role (season 8), main role (season 9)\n |\n| 2014–2015\n | *A to Z* | Zelda Vasco\n | Main role\n |\n| 2015\n | *Family Guy* | Becca\n | Voice role Episode: \"Roasted Guy\"\n |\n| *Fargo* | Betsy Solverson\n | Recurring role (season 2), 9 episodes\n |\n| 2015–2016\n | *The Mindy Project* | Whitney\n | Recurring role, 5 episodes\n |\n| 2016–2018\n | *The Venture Bros.* | Sirena / various voices\n | Recurring voice role, 8 episodes\n |\n| 2017\n | *Black Mirror* | Nanette Cole\n | Episode: \"USS *Callister*\"\n |\n| 2018\n | *No Activity* | Frankie\n | Main role (season 2)\n |\n| 2019\n | *Modern Love* | Maggie Mitchell\n | Episode: \"When the Doorman Is Your Main Man\"\n |\n| 2020\n | *Mythic Quest: Raven's Banquet* | Bean\n | Episode: \"A Dark Quiet Death\"\n |\n| *Death to 2020* | Kathy Flowers\n | Television special\n |\n| 2021\n | *Ziwe* | Friend\n | Episode: \"55%\"\n |\n| *The Simpsons* | Barb\n | Voice role Episode: \"A Serious Flanders\"\n |\n| *Death to 2021* | Kathy Flowers\n | Television special\n |\n| 2021–2022\n | *Made for Love* | Hazel Green\n | Main role\n |\n| 2022\n | *The Resort* | Emma Reed\n | Main role\n |\n| 2023\n | *Bob's Burgers* | Alice\n | Voice role Episode: \"Radio No You Didn't\"\n |\n| 2024\n | *The Penguin* | Sofia Falcone | Upcoming limited series\n |\n\n\n### Theatre[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Venue(s)\n | Refs. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2006\n | *The Lieutenant of Inishmore* | Mairead (understudy)\n | Lyceum Theatre   New York City, NY  |  |\n| 2007\n | *Coram Boy* | Alice Ashbrook\n | Imperial Theatre   New York City, NY  | [8] |\n| *The Devil's Disciple* | Essie\n | Irish Repertory Theatre   New York City, NY  |  |\n| 2008\n | *Crooked* | Laney\n |  |  |\n| *Some Americans Abroad* | Katie Taylor\n |  |  |\n| 2009\n | *The Retributionists* | Dinchka Fried\n |  |  |\n| *The Heart is a Lonely Hunter* | Mick Kelly\n | New York Theatre Workshop   New York City, NY  | [22] |\n| *Stunning* | Lily\n | Lincoln Center Theater   New York City, NY  | [23] |\n| 2010\n | *The Little Foxes* | Alexandra\n | New York Theatre Workshop   New York City, NY  | [24] |\n| *That Face* | Mia\n | Manhattan Theatre Club   New York City, NY  | [25] |\n| 2011\n | *Once* | Girl\n | American Repertory Theatre   Cambridge, MA  |  |\n| New York Theatre Workshop   New York City, NY  |  |\n| 2012–2013\n | Bernard B.

It received positive reviews initially, but reception became more mixed as the seasons went on.[2][3][4] The show was nominated for 91 awards and received 21. In 2010, Alyson Hannigan won the People's Choice Award for Favorite TV Comedy Actress. In 2012, seven years after its premiere, the series won the People's Choice Award for Favorite Network TV Comedy, and Neil Patrick Harris won the award for Favorite TV Comedy Actor twice.\n\n\n\n\n## Premise[edit]\n\n\nThe series follows the adventures of Ted Mosby (played by Josh Radnor) and his love life as a single man. His stories are narrated by Bob Saget as Ted Mosby 25 years later as he tells them to his children.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n***How I Met Your Mother*** (often abbreviated as ***HIMYM***) is an American sitcom, created by Craig Thomas and Carter Bays for CBS. The series, which aired from September 19, 2005 to March 31, 2014, follows the main character, Ted Mosby, and his group of friends in New York City's Manhattan. As a framing device, Ted, in 2030, recounts to his son, Luke, and daughter, Penny, the events from September 2005 to May 2013 that led him to meet their mother. *How I Met Your Mother* was a joint production by Bays & Thomas Productions and 20th Century Fox Television, and syndicated by 20th Television (now Disney-ABC Domestic Television).\n\n\nThe series was loosely inspired by Thomas and Bays' friendship when they both lived in New York.[1] The vast majority of the episodes (196 out of 208) were directed by Pamela Fryman. The other directors were Rob Greenberg (7 episodes), Michael Shea (4 episodes), and Neil Patrick Harris (1 episode).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"TV Summer School: How to Create and Run a Successful Sitcom\". *E!

Ted is based loosely on Bays, and Marshall and Lily are based loosely on Thomas and his wife.[5][6] Thomas' wife Rebecca was initially reluctant to have a character based on her but agreed if they could get Alyson Hannigan to play her. Hannigan was looking to do more comedy work and was available.[5] Josh Radnor and Jason Segel, who were cast as Ted and Marshall, respectively, were not well known, although Segel had been a cast member on the short-lived *Freaks and Geeks* and a recurring guest star on Judd Apatow's follow-up show, *Undeclared*. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | September 21, 2009 (2009-09-21) | 9.09[136] | May 24, 2010 (2010-05-24) | 8.06[137] | 2009–10 | 42[138] | 8.60[138] |\n| 6 | 24\n | September 20, 2010 (2010-09-20) | 8.79[139] | May 16, 2011 (2011-05-16) | 7.15[140] | 2010–11 | 48[141] | 8.79[141] |\n| 7 | 24\n | September 19, 2011 (2011-09-19) | 11.00[142] | May 14, 2012 (2012-05-14) | 8.58[143] | 2011–12 | 45[124] | 9.67[124] |\n| 8 | 24\n | September 24, 2012 (2012-09-24) | 8.84[144] | May 13, 2013 (2013-05-13) | 8.57[145] | 2012–13 | 42[146] | 9.02[146] |\n| 9 | 24\n | September 23, 2013 (2013-09-23) | 9.40[147] | March 31, 2014 (2014-03-31) | 13.13[148] | 2013–14 | 28[123] | 10.51[123] |\n\n\n## Awards and nominations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of awards and nominations received by *How I Met Your Mother*\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n23. **^** Ryan, Maureen (July 19, 2008). \"Barney writes a book, Barney + Robin, Ted + Stella and other 'How I Met Your Mother' news\". *Chicago Tribune*.

At the end of the fourth season only 88 episodes had been produced, and a further 22 episodes were required, ensuring that there would be a fifth season.[29] There also was a complication with the writing of the show because of actress Alyson Hannigan's absence due to her pregnancy; in response, the writers had to create episodes that did not include one of the five main characters.[30] On May 19, 2009, the fifth-season renewal was announced.[31] May 20, 2009, CBS announced that *How I Met Your Mother* would again be aired at 8 pm, leading into the new comedy *Accidentally on Purpose*. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Alyson Hannigan as Lily Aldrin, a kindergarten teacher, aspiring artist, and Marshall's wife. She is terrible at keeping secrets and can be manipulative at times. She marries Marshall in season 2 and gives birth to Marvin in season 7. Though appearing sweet and cute, Lily can be quite unexpectedly fierce. Her best girl friend is Robin, whom she met through Ted as he dated Robin. Hannigan's husband Alexis Denisof appeared in ten episodes as Sandy Rivers.\n* Cristin Milioti as The Mother, the titular character who is Ted's future wife. She makes her first official appearance in Season 8, and gradually meets all the characters throughout Season 9 leading up to her meeting Ted.\n\n\n## Season synopsis[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of *How I Met Your Mother* episodes\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n## External links[edit]\n\n\n**How I Met Your Mother** at Wikipedia's sister projects\n\n* ![](image)Media from Commons\n* ![](image)Quotations from Wikiquote\n* ![](image)Data from Wikidata\n\n* How I Met Your Mother at Curlie\n* *How I Met Your Mother* at IMDb ![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\n* *How I Met Your Dad* at IMDb ![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n*How I Met Your Mother*\n |\n| --- |\n| Episodes | * Season 1\n* 2\n* 3\n* 4\n* 5\n* 6\n* 7\n* 8\n* 9\n |\n| Characters | * Ted Mosby\n* Marshall Eriksen\n* Lily Aldrin\n* Barney Stinson\n* Robin Scherbatsky\n* Tracy McConnell\n |\n| Soundtracks | * \"Let's Go to the Mall\"\n* \"Sandcastles in the Sand\"\n* \"Nothing Suits Me Like a Suit\"\n* \"P.S.

He tells the story of his adult years from his late twenties to his mid thirties, and all the obstacles he overcomes before he meets \"The One\" (the Mother). This story is told by the Older Ted Mosby, and narrator of the series, Bob Saget. Ted moved to New York City with his friends Marshall and Lily after graduating from Wesleyan University. In New York, he met Barney (at the urinal of MacLaren's) and Robin, to whom he was immediately attracted. Ted is on a quest for happiness and \"The One\", the woman he will marry. He has many relationships, one with Robin, that reveal the qualities he wants in his future wife. At the end of each relationship, with levity, he reflects on what went wrong. Although hope to find \"the one\" diminishes with each failed relationship, Ted does not give up. He has more elegant and higher-class interests than his friends. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n6. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Ryan, Maureen (April 27, 2006). \"Craig Thomas: 'Sitcoms used to be about something'\". *Chicago Tribune*.

For his performance he earned a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series nomination.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nSegel was born on January 18, 1980, in Los Angeles, California, to Jillian (née Jordan; born 1952) and Alvin Segel, a lawyer.[1][2][3][4] He grew up in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood.[5] He has an older brother, Adam,[1][6] and a younger sister, Alison.[7]\n\n\nSegel's father is Jewish,[8][9][10] whereas his mother is of English, Scottish, Irish, and French descent.[11] He has stated that he was raised Jewish,[12] as well as \"a little bit of everything\".[13] Segel went to Hebrew school and had a Bar Mitzvah ceremony, and also attended St. Matthew's Parish School, a private Episcopal school.[9][14][15]\n\n\nFollowing elementary school and middle school, Segel completed his high school studies at Harvard-Westlake School, where his 6 ft 4 in (1.93 m) frame helped him as an active member of the 1996 and 1997 CIF state champion boys' basketball team.[16][17] He won a slam dunk contest in high school[18] and he was nicknamed \"Dr. Dunk.\"[19] He was a backup to the team's star center, Jason Collins, who went on to play in the NBA.[16]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n![A man holds a microphone as he speaks](image)Segel at the Austin premiere of *I Love You, Man* in 2009\nSegel's first major role was as stoner \"freak\" Nick Andopolis on the critically acclaimed but short-lived 1999 NBC comedy-drama series *Freaks and Geeks*. The series revolved around a group of suburban Detroit high school students circa 1980. Segel personally composed a song for his character, Nick, to sing to the lead female character, Lindsay (Linda Cardellini).[20]\n\n\nSegel had recurring roles on *CSI: Crime Scene Investigation* as Neil Jansen and on *Undeclared* as Eric. He played Marshall Eriksen on the CBS sitcom *How I Met Your Mother*; he had previously stated he would move on to other projects in 2013 when his contract expired,[21] but was convinced to finish the series after its ninth season in 2014.[22]\n\n\nSegel made his film debut with *Can't Hardly Wait* in 1998. His other early feature film appearances include *Slackers*, *SLC Punk!*, *The Good Humor Man*, and *Dead Man on Campus*. In 2007, he appeared in *Knocked Up*, directed by *Freaks and Geeks* producer Judd Apatow. Segel starred in the lead role of 2008's *Forgetting Sarah Marshall*, a film he wrote and Apatow produced with Shauna Robertson for Universal Pictures. He also starred in *I Love You, Man*, which was released on March 20, 2009, by DreamWorks.[23]\n\n\nIn *Forgetting Sarah Marshall*, Segel's character writes a \"Dracula\" musical performed by puppets. He also appeared in the most prominent scene containing full frontal nudity in the film.[24] In an interview,[25] he stated that the Dracula musical with puppets, as well as being broken up with while naked, were real experiences he wrote into the movie. Those cloth creatures were custom-made by the Jim Henson Company, and the experience emboldened Segel to pitch his concept for a Muppets movie.[26] Segel performed a song from the film, \"Dracula's Lament\", on the 1000th episode of *The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson*.[27]\n\n\n\n![A man smiles as he waves](image)Segel at the Australian premiere of *The Muppets* in Sydney in 2011\nFor the 2010 comedy *Get Him to the Greek*, Segel co-wrote most of the soundtrack's music which was performed by the fictional celebrity singer, Aldous Snow, including Infant Sorrow. He also appeared on *The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson* and sang an original song entitled \"Wonky Eyed Girl\".[28]\n\n\nIn 2010, he voiced Gru's arch-rival Vector in the Universal's CGI animated film, *Despicable Me* and appeared as \"Horatio\" in a fantasy comedy film *Gulliver's Travels* directed by Rob Letterman and very loosely based on Part One of the 18th-century novel of the same name by Jonathan Swift. Segel appeared in *Bad Teacher*, starring Cameron Diaz, which opened in June 2011. He played gym teacher and thwarted suitor Russell Gettis.[29] Along with Nicholas Stoller, Segel approached Disney in 2007 to write the latest *Muppets* film. Disney was unsure on how to take the request, as Segel had just done frontal nudity in *Forgetting Sarah Marshall*, but after realizing that he was a fan, the project was approved. Segel stated that he wanted to do the film because the last film in the series to be released in theaters was *Muppets from Space* in 1999, and he felt that the younger generation was missing out on enjoying one of his childhood favorites.[30]\n\n\nSegel decided not to star in the sequel to *The Muppets*, *Muppets Most Wanted*.[31] He filmed *The Five-Year Engagement*, with Emily Blunt, in spring 2011, in Michigan, and the film was released on April 27, 2012.[32]\n\n\nIn 2013, Segel revealed he was working on a series of young adult novels, based on a story he conceived when he was 21.[33] In the fall of 2014, the first novel of the series *Nightmares!*, co-written with Kirsten Miller, was released, with the followup coming out the following year.[34][35]\n\n\nIn 2015, Segel received praise[36][37][38] for his portrayal of the late author David Foster Wallace in the independent biographical drama film *The End of the Tour*. For his performance, he earned an Independent Spirit Award nomination for Best Male Lead.[39]\n\n\nIn 2017, Segel and Miller released a new book, *Otherworld*, the first of a new young adult series. A second book in the series, *OtherEarth*, was released in 2018, and a third novel, *OtherLife*, in 2019. Segel created and starred in the American drama television series *Dispatches from Elsewhere*, which premiered on March 1, 2020, on AMC.\n\n\nIn 2019, Segel starred in *Our Friend* based on Matthew Teague's 2015 essay \"The Friend\".[40]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nSegel is an ordained minister with the Universal Life Church.[41] He performed a wedding ceremony on *The Tonight Show* on July 6, 2010, for a couple that solicited his services by placing pictures of him around his hometown and the bar he frequently visited.[42]\n\n\nSegel dated his *Freaks and Geeks* co-star Linda Cardellini for several years following the show's cancellation.[43] He dated Michelle Williams from 2012 to 2013.[44] From December 2013 to April 2021, Segel dated photographer Alexis Mixter.[45][46]\n\n\n\n## Filmography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Segel, Neil Patrick Harris and Joss Whedon in 2011\n### Film[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1998\n | *Can't Hardly Wait* | Matt\n |  |\n| 1998\n | *Dead Man on Campus* | Kyle\n |  |\n| 1998\n | *SLC Punk!* | Mike\n |  |\n| 2002\n | *Slackers* | Sam Schechter\n |  |\n| 2003\n | *11:14* | Leon (Paramedic #1)\n |  |\n| 2003\n | *Certainly Not a Fairytale* | Leo\n |  |\n| 2004\n | *LolliLove* | Jason\n |  |\n| 2005\n | *The Good Humor Man* | Smelly Bob\n |  |\n| 2006\n | *Bye Bye Benjamin* | Theodore Everest\n |  |\n| 2006\n | *Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny* | Frat Boy\n | Deleted scenes\n |\n| 2007\n | *Knocked Up* | Jason\n |  |\n| 2008\n | *Forgetting Sarah Marshall* | Peter Bretter\n | Also writer |\n| 2009\n | *I Love You, Man* | Sydney Fife\n |  |\n| 2010\n | *Despicable Me* | Victor \"Vector\" Perkins (voice)\n |  |\n| 2010\n | *Gulliver's Travels* | Horatio\n |  |\n| 2011\n | *Bad Teacher* | Russell Gettis\n |  |\n| 2011\n | *Friends with Benefits* | Brice\n | Uncredited cameo\n |\n| 2011\n | *Jeff, Who Lives at Home* | Jeff Thompkins\n |  |\n| 2011\n | *The Muppets* | Gary\n | Also writer and executive producer |\n| 2012\n | *The Five-Year Engagement* | Tom Solomon\n | Also writer and executive producer\n |\n| 2012\n | *This Is 40* | Jason\n |  |\n| 2013\n | *This Is the End* | Himself\n | Uncredited cameo\n |\n| 2014\n | *Sex Tape* | Jay Hargrove\n | Also writer and executive producer\n |\n| 2015\n | *The End of the Tour* | David Foster Wallace |  |\n| 2017\n | *The Discovery* | Will Harbor\n |  |\n| 2018\n | *Come Sunday* | Henry\n |  |\n| 2019\n | *Our Friend*[47] | Dane Faucheux\n |  |\n| 2022\n | *The Sky Is Everywhere*[48] | Big Walker\n |  |\n| 2022\n | *Windfall*[49] | Nobody\n | Also story writer and producer\n |\n\n\n### Television[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1999–2000\n | *Freaks and Geeks* | Nick Andopolis | Main role;

'Oh no, I have to actually perform. I have to do well, and I have to have a voice... and I have to have thoughts now.'\"[7]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### 2002–2016: Early roles and breakthrough[edit]\n\n\n![A brunette woman smiles](image)Smulders at a CBS event in 2008\nSmulders made her professional acting debut in 2002, with guest appearances in the UPN science fiction comedy series *Special Unit 2* and the Showtime science fiction drama series *Jeremiah*.

She is known for playing Tracy McConnell in the CBS sitcom *How I Met Your Mother* from 2013 to 2014, and for her work in theater productions such as *That Face*, *Stunning*, and the Tony Award-winning musical *Once*, for which she won a Grammy Award and was nominated for a Tony Award. She has also played Teresa Petrillo Belfort in the 2013 film *The Wolf of Wall Street*, Sarah Wilder in the 2020 film *Palm Springs*, Betsy Solverson in the second season of *Fargo* (2015), Hazel Green in the HBO Max comedy series *Made for Love* (2021–2022), and Emma in the Peacock black comedy mystery series *The Resort* (2022).\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nMilioti was born on August 16, 1985, in Cherry Hill, New Jersey.[1] She is of Italian descent, and calls her family \"Olive Garden Italian\".[2] In middle school, she found her love of acting at Long Lake Camp for the Arts in Long Lake, New York.[3] She graduated in 2003 from Cherry Hill High School East, where she began performing in school plays.[4] She took acting classes at New York University, but dropped out during her sophomore year.[5][6] Milioti admitted that she was \"wildly unhappy there\" and dropped out as a result.[5]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n![Milioti strumming a ukulele onstage](image)Milioti playing ukulele in 2013.\nMilioti's first acting roles were bit parts in national advertising campaign ads, notably one for the Ford Edge.[7] She also appeared in television programs such as *The Sopranos* and films such as *Greetings from the Shore*. Milioti is also known for her stage performances. In 2007, she appeared on Broadway as Alice Ashbrook in Helen Edmundson's award-winning adaptation of Jamila Gavin's novel *Coram Boy*.[8] In 2010, she starred in *That Face*,[9] and was nominated for a Lucille Lortel Award for Outstanding Lead Actress for her work in *Stunning*.[10]\n\n\nIn 2012, she received a Tony Award nomination for Best Actress in a Musical for her portrayal of Girl in *Once*, a musical in which she performed from 2011 to 2013.[11] Of her performance, Ben Brantley of the *New York Times* wrote: \"It’s not easy playing a winsome life force with a foreign accent. But Ms. Milioti has mastered the assignment brilliantly. She brings a new confidence to her portrayal, and an enhanced mixture of wit and wisdom, which suggests a maturity in youth, a fatalism hard won during an Eastern European childhood. And together she and Mr. Kazee exude a chemistry that is all the more achingly real for being so subdued.\"[12] Her *Once* performance, with fellow principal soloist Steve Kazee, earned the 2013 Grammy Award for Best Musical Theater Album. She also read aloud a short story for the 2011 *This American Life* episode \"Adventure\".[13] In 2012, she appeared on several songs of Glen Hansard's debut album *Rhythm and Repose*.\n\n\nIn 2013, Milioti was cast in the CBS sitcom *How I Met Your Mother* as the titular Mother, appearing for the first time in the season eight finale titled \"Something New\", and was promoted to a series regular for the show's ninth and final season.[14] Milioti portrayed Jordan Belfort's first wife, Teresa Petrillo, in the 2013 Martin Scorsese film *The Wolf of Wall Street*.[15] In February 2014, she was cast as Zelda, the female lead on NBC's comedy *A to Z* which premiered that October and aired for one season of 13 episodes.[16] In 2015, she co-starred on the second season of *FX's Fargo* as Betsy Solverson, the cancer-stricken wife of state trooper Lou Solverson and mother of future deputy Molly Solverson. In 2017, Milioti appeared in the fourth season of the sci-fi anthology show *Black Mirror* in the episode \"USS Callister\" as Nanette Cole, a newly employed game developer whose digital recreation becomes trapped in a virtual simulator game.[17]\n\n\nIn 2020, Milioti starred in the sci-fi/comedy *Palm Springs*, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January and on Hulu in July.[18] In 2021, she starred in the HBO Max dark comedy series *Made for Love* as the entrapped wife of a tech billionaire from whom she runs away.[19]\n\n\nIn 2024, Milioti is set to star as Sofia Falcone in the Max spin-off miniseries of *The Batman* titled *The Penguin*, opposite Colin Farrell.[20][21]\n\n\n\n## Acting credits[edit]\n\n\n### Film[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2007\n | *Greetings from the Shore* | Didi\n |  |\n| 2009\n | *Year of the Carnivore* | Sammy Smalls\n |  |\n| 2012\n | *Sleepwalk with Me* | Janet Pandamiglio\n |  |\n| *I Am Ben* | The Journalist\n |  |\n| *The Brass Teapot* | Brandi\n |  |\n| 2013\n | *Bert and Arnie's Guide to Friendship* | Faye\n |  |\n| *The Wolf of Wall Street* | Teresa Petrillo Belfort\n |  |\n| 2014\n | *The Occupants* | Lucy\n |  |\n| 2015\n | *It Had to Be You* | Sonia\n |  |\n| 2017\n | *Breakable You* | Maud Weller\n |  |\n| 2020\n | *Palm Springs* | Sarah Wilder\n |  |\n\n\n### Television[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2006\n | *3 lbs* | Megan Rafferty\n | Episode: \"Bad Boys\"\n |\n| 2006–2007\n | *The Sopranos* | Catherine Sacrimoni | 3 episodes\n |\n| 2009\n | *The Unusuals* | Sketch Artist\n | 2 episodes\n |\n| 2010\n | *The Good Wife* | Onya Eggertson\n | Episode: \"Taking Control\"\n |\n| 2011\n | *30 Rock* | Abby Flynn/Abby Grossman\n | Episode: \"TGS Hates Women\"\n |\n| *Nurse Jackie* | Monica\n | Episode: \"...Deaf Blind Tumor Pee-Test\"\n |\n| 2013–2014\n | *How I Met Your Mother* | Tracy McConnell / The Mother | Guest role (season 8), main role (season 9)\n |\n| 2014–2015\n | *A to Z* | Zelda Vasco\n | Main role\n |\n| 2015\n | *Family Guy* | Becca\n | Voice role Episode: \"Roasted Guy\"\n |\n| *Fargo* | Betsy Solverson\n | Recurring role (season 2), 9 episodes\n |\n| 2015–2016\n | *The Mindy Project* | Whitney\n | Recurring role, 5 episodes\n |\n| 2016–2018\n | *The Venture Bros.* | Sirena / various voices\n | Recurring voice role, 8 episodes\n |\n| 2017\n | *Black Mirror* | Nanette Cole\n | Episode: \"USS *Callister*\"\n |\n| 2018\n | *No Activity* | Frankie\n | Main role (season 2)\n |\n| 2019\n | *Modern Love* | Maggie Mitchell\n | Episode: \"When the Doorman Is Your Main Man\"\n |\n| 2020\n | *Mythic Quest: Raven's Banquet* | Bean\n | Episode: \"A Dark Quiet Death\"\n |\n| *Death to 2020* | Kathy Flowers\n | Television special\n |\n| 2021\n | *Ziwe* | Friend\n | Episode: \"55%\"\n |\n| *The Simpsons* | Barb\n | Voice role Episode: \"A Serious Flanders\"\n |\n| *Death to 2021* | Kathy Flowers\n | Television special\n |\n| 2021–2022\n | *Made for Love* | Hazel Green\n | Main role\n |\n| 2022\n | *The Resort* | Emma Reed\n | Main role\n |\n| 2023\n | *Bob's Burgers* | Alice\n | Voice role Episode: \"Radio No You Didn't\"\n |\n| 2024\n | *The Penguin* | Sofia Falcone | Upcoming limited series\n |\n\n\n### Theatre[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Venue(s)\n | Refs. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2006\n | *The Lieutenant of Inishmore* | Mairead (understudy)\n | Lyceum Theatre   New York City, NY  |  |\n| 2007\n | *Coram Boy* | Alice Ashbrook\n | Imperial Theatre   New York City, NY  | [8] |\n| *The Devil's Disciple* | Essie\n | Irish Repertory Theatre   New York City, NY  |  |\n| 2008\n | *Crooked* | Laney\n |  |  |\n| *Some Americans Abroad* | Katie Taylor\n |  |  |\n| 2009\n | *The Retributionists* | Dinchka Fried\n |  |  |\n| *The Heart is a Lonely Hunter* | Mick Kelly\n | New York Theatre Workshop   New York City, NY  | [22] |\n| *Stunning* | Lily\n | Lincoln Center Theater   New York City, NY  | [23] |\n| 2010\n | *The Little Foxes* | Alexandra\n | New York Theatre Workshop   New York City, NY  | [24] |\n| *That Face* | Mia\n | Manhattan Theatre Club   New York City, NY  | [25] |\n| 2011\n | *Once* | Girl\n | American Repertory Theatre   Cambridge, MA  |  |\n| New York Theatre Workshop   New York City, NY  |  |\n| 2012–2013\n | Bernard B.

The series, which aired from September 19, 2005 to March 31, 2014, follows the main character, Ted Mosby, and his group of friends in New York City's Manhattan. As a framing device, Ted, in 2030, recounts to his son, Luke, and daughter, Penny, the events from September 2005 to May 2013 that led him to meet their mother. *How I Met Your Mother* was a joint production by Bays & Thomas Productions and 20th Century Fox Television, and syndicated by 20th Television (now Disney-ABC Domestic Television).\n\n\nThe series was loosely inspired by Thomas and Bays' friendship when they both lived in New York.[1] The vast majority of the episodes (196 out of 208) were directed by Pamela Fryman. The other directors were Rob Greenberg (7 episodes), Michael Shea (4 episodes), and Neil Patrick Harris (1 episode).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nKnown for its unique structure, humor, and incorporation of dramatic elements, *How I Met Your Mother* was popular throughout its run. It received positive reviews initially, but reception became more mixed as the seasons went on.[2][3][4] The show was nominated for 91 awards and received 21. In 2010, Alyson Hannigan won the People's Choice Award for Favorite TV Comedy Actress. In 2012, seven years after its premiere, the series won the People's Choice Award for Favorite Network TV Comedy, and Neil Patrick Harris won the award for Favorite TV Comedy Actor twice.\n\n\n\n\n## Premise[edit]\n\n\nThe series follows the adventures of Ted Mosby (played by Josh Radnor) and his love life as a single man. His stories are narrated by Bob Saget as Ted Mosby 25 years later as he tells them to his children.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| *How I Met Your Mother* |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)The cast pictured in the opening sequence\n |\n| Genre | * Sitcom\n* Romantic comedy\n* Comedy drama\n |\n| Created by | * Carter Bays\n* Craig Thomas\n |\n| Starring | * Josh Radnor\n* Jason Segel\n* Cobie Smulders\n* Neil Patrick Harris\n* Alyson Hannigan\n* Cristin Milioti\n |\n| Narrated by | Bob Saget |\n| Opening theme | \"Hey, Beautiful\" by The Solids |\n| Composer | John Swihart |\n| Country of origin | United States |\n| Original language | English |\n| No. of seasons | 9 |\n| No. of episodes | 208 (list of episodes) |\n| Production |\n| Executive producers | * Carter Bays\n* Craig Thomas\n* Rob Greenberg\n* Pamela Fryman\n* Eileen Heisler\n* DeAnn Heline\n* Phil Lord\n* Greg Malins\n* Christopher Miller\n* Chris Harris\n* Stephen Lloyd\n* Kourtney Kang\n* Jamie Rhonheimer\n* Chuck Tatham\n |\n| Producers | * Randy Cordray\n* Suzy Mamann Greenberg\n* Chris Harris\n* Jamie Rhonheimer\n* Kourtney Kang\n* Brenda Hsueh\n* Theresa Mulligan Rosenthal\n* Stewart Halpern-Fingerhut\n* Rob Greenberg\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n36. **^** \"CBS announces 2011–2012 premiere dates\" (Press release).

At the end of the fourth season only 88 episodes had been produced, and a further 22 episodes were required, ensuring that there would be a fifth season.[29] There also was a complication with the writing of the show because of actress Alyson Hannigan's absence due to her pregnancy; in response, the writers had to create episodes that did not include one of the five main characters.[30] On May 19, 2009, the fifth-season renewal was announced.[31] May 20, 2009, CBS announced that *How I Met Your Mother* would again be aired at 8 pm, leading into the new comedy *Accidentally on Purpose*. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"TV Summer School: How to Create and Run a Successful Sitcom\". *E!

Ted is based loosely on Bays, and Marshall and Lily are based loosely on Thomas and his wife.[5][6] Thomas' wife Rebecca was initially reluctant to have a character based on her but agreed if they could get Alyson Hannigan to play her. Hannigan was looking to do more comedy work and was available.[5] Josh Radnor and Jason Segel, who were cast as Ted and Marshall, respectively, were not well known, although Segel had been a cast member on the short-lived *Freaks and Geeks* and a recurring guest star on Judd Apatow's follow-up show, *Undeclared*. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n23. **^** Ryan, Maureen (July 19, 2008). \"Barney writes a book, Barney + Robin, Ted + Stella and other 'How I Met Your Mother' news\". *Chicago Tribune*.

The narrative deals primarily with his best friends. These include the long-lasting couple Marshall Eriksen (Jason Segel), a law student and Lily Aldrin (Alyson Hannigan), a kindergarten teacher, who have been dating for almost nine years when Marshall proposes, as well as womanizing playboy Barney Stinson (Neil Patrick Harris), and Canadian news reporter Robin Scherbatsky (Cobie Smulders). All of the characters' lives are entwined. The series explores many storylines, including a \"will they or won't they\" relationship between Robin and each of the two single male friends, Marshall and Lily's relationship, and the ups and downs of the characters' careers.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe first season was met with generally favorable reviews from critics, although some compared the series unfavorably to *Friends*. On Metacritic, a review aggregation site that collected 25 reviews for the series, it scored a 69 out of 100.[47] Michael Abernethy of *PopMatters* gave the season a negative review, writing that \"The comedy that does occur in *How I Met Your Mother* isn't enough to compensate for its inconsistencies.\"[48] Tom Shales of *The Washington Post* gave the season a lukewarm review, saying it's \"a little better than most other sitcoms, past and present -- especially those featuring wacky urban friends in their twenties experiencing the bittersweet mysteries of life.\"[49] Melanie Macfarlane of the *Seattle Post-Intelligencer* gave the season a positive review, saying the show \"may not break any comedic ground, but it's the sort of comfortable, reliable hitter CBS needs on Monday nights.\"[50]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWebsites were consistently mentioned throughout the How I Met Your Mother series. Many of the websites directly tie in to running gags on the show. CBS turned nearly every website mentioned in the series into a real functioning website. Since the show’s ending in 2014, a majority of the websites remain active.[77]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_p1L1nExOWs2I1r2CWuzxt4lL","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

The series revolved around a group of suburban Detroit high school students circa 1980. Segel personally composed a song for his character, Nick, to sing to the lead female character, Lindsay (Linda Cardellini).[20]\n\n\nSegel had recurring roles on *CSI: Crime Scene Investigation* as Neil Jansen and on *Undeclared* as Eric. He played Marshall Eriksen on the CBS sitcom *How I Met Your Mother*; he had previously stated he would move on to other projects in 2013 when his contract expired,[21] but was convinced to finish the series after its ninth season in 2014.[22]\n\n\nSegel made his film debut with *Can't Hardly Wait* in 1998. His other early feature film appearances include *Slackers*, *SLC Punk!*, *The Good Humor Man*, and *Dead Man on Campus*. In 2007, he appeared in *Knocked Up*, directed by *Freaks and Geeks* producer Judd Apatow. Segel starred in the lead role of 2008's *Forgetting Sarah Marshall*, a film he wrote and Apatow produced with Shauna Robertson for Universal Pictures. He also starred in *I Love You, Man*, which was released on March 20, 2009, by DreamWorks.[23]\n\n\nIn *Forgetting Sarah Marshall*, Segel's character writes a \"Dracula\" musical performed by puppets. He also appeared in the most prominent scene containing full frontal nudity in the film.[24] In an interview,[25] he stated that the Dracula musical with puppets, as well as being broken up with while naked, were real experiences he wrote into the movie. Those cloth creatures were custom-made by the Jim Henson Company, and the experience emboldened Segel to pitch his concept for a Muppets movie.[26] Segel performed a song from the film, \"Dracula's Lament\", on the 1000th episode of *The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson*.[27]\n\n\n\n![A man smiles as he waves](image)Segel at the Australian premiere of *The Muppets* in Sydney in 2011\nFor the 2010 comedy *Get Him to the Greek*, Segel co-wrote most of the soundtrack's music which was performed by the fictional celebrity singer, Aldous Snow, including Infant Sorrow. He also appeared on *The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson* and sang an original song entitled \"Wonky Eyed Girl\".[28]\n\n\nIn 2010, he voiced Gru's arch-rival Vector in the Universal's CGI animated film, *Despicable Me* and appeared as \"Horatio\" in a fantasy comedy film *Gulliver's Travels* directed by Rob Letterman and very loosely based on Part One of the 18th-century novel of the same name by Jonathan Swift. Segel appeared in *Bad Teacher*, starring Cameron Diaz, which opened in June 2011. He played gym teacher and thwarted suitor Russell Gettis.[29] Along with Nicholas Stoller, Segel approached Disney in 2007 to write the latest *Muppets* film. Disney was unsure on how to take the request, as Segel had just done frontal nudity in *Forgetting Sarah Marshall*, but after realizing that he was a fan, the project was approved. Segel stated that he wanted to do the film because the last film in the series to be released in theaters was *Muppets from Space* in 1999, and he felt that the younger generation was missing out on enjoying one of his childhood favorites.[30]\n\n\nSegel decided not to star in the sequel to *The Muppets*, *Muppets Most Wanted*.[31] He filmed *The Five-Year Engagement*, with Emily Blunt, in spring 2011, in Michigan, and the film was released on April 27, 2012.[32]\n\n\nIn 2013, Segel revealed he was working on a series of young adult novels, based on a story he conceived when he was 21.[33] In the fall of 2014, the first novel of the series *Nightmares!*, co-written with Kirsten Miller, was released, with the followup coming out the following year.[34][35]\n\n\nIn 2015, Segel received praise[36][37][38] for his portrayal of the late author David Foster Wallace in the independent biographical drama film *The End of the Tour*. For his performance, he earned an Independent Spirit Award nomination for Best Male Lead.[39]\n\n\nIn 2017, Segel and Miller released a new book, *Otherworld*, the first of a new young adult series. A second book in the series, *OtherEarth*, was released in 2018, and a third novel, *OtherLife*, in 2019. Segel created and starred in the American drama television series *Dispatches from Elsewhere*, which premiered on March 1, 2020, on AMC.\n\n\nIn 2019, Segel starred in *Our Friend* based on Matthew Teague's 2015 essay \"The Friend\".[40]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nSegel is an ordained minister with the Universal Life Church.[41] He performed a wedding ceremony on *The Tonight Show* on July 6, 2010, for a couple that solicited his services by placing pictures of him around his hometown and the bar he frequently visited.[42]\n\n\nSegel dated his *Freaks and Geeks* co-star Linda Cardellini for several years following the show's cancellation.[43] He dated Michelle Williams from 2012 to 2013.[44] From December 2013 to April 2021, Segel dated photographer Alexis Mixter.[45][46]\n\n\n\n## Filmography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Segel, Neil Patrick Harris and Joss Whedon in 2011\n### Film[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1998\n | *Can't Hardly Wait* | Matt\n |  |\n| 1998\n | *Dead Man on Campus* | Kyle\n |  |\n| 1998\n | *SLC Punk!* | Mike\n |  |\n| 2002\n | *Slackers* | Sam Schechter\n |  |\n| 2003\n | *11:14* | Leon (Paramedic #1)\n |  |\n| 2003\n | *Certainly Not a Fairytale* | Leo\n |  |\n| 2004\n | *LolliLove* | Jason\n |  |\n| 2005\n | *The Good Humor Man* | Smelly Bob\n |  |\n| 2006\n | *Bye Bye Benjamin* | Theodore Everest\n |  |\n| 2006\n | *Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny* | Frat Boy\n | Deleted scenes\n |\n| 2007\n | *Knocked Up* | Jason\n |  |\n| 2008\n | *Forgetting Sarah Marshall* | Peter Bretter\n | Also writer |\n| 2009\n | *I Love You, Man* | Sydney Fife\n |  |\n| 2010\n | *Despicable Me* | Victor \"Vector\" Perkins (voice)\n |  |\n| 2010\n | *Gulliver's Travels* | Horatio\n |  |\n| 2011\n | *Bad Teacher* | Russell Gettis\n |  |\n| 2011\n | *Friends with Benefits* | Brice\n | Uncredited cameo\n |\n| 2011\n | *Jeff, Who Lives at Home* | Jeff Thompkins\n |  |\n| 2011\n | *The Muppets* | Gary\n | Also writer and executive producer |\n| 2012\n | *The Five-Year Engagement* | Tom Solomon\n | Also writer and executive producer\n |\n| 2012\n | *This Is 40* | Jason\n |  |\n| 2013\n | *This Is the End* | Himself\n | Uncredited cameo\n |\n| 2014\n | *Sex Tape* | Jay Hargrove\n | Also writer and executive producer\n |\n| 2015\n | *The End of the Tour* | David Foster Wallace |  |\n| 2017\n | *The Discovery* | Will Harbor\n |  |\n| 2018\n | *Come Sunday* | Henry\n |  |\n| 2019\n | *Our Friend*[47] | Dane Faucheux\n |  |\n| 2022\n | *The Sky Is Everywhere*[48] | Big Walker\n |  |\n| 2022\n | *Windfall*[49] | Nobody\n | Also story writer and producer\n |\n\n\n### Television[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1999–2000\n | *Freaks and Geeks* | Nick Andopolis | Main role;

He is best known for portraying Ted Mosby on the Emmy Award–winning CBS sitcom *How I Met Your Mother*. He made his writing and directorial debut with the 2010 comedy drama film *Happythankyoumoreplease*, for which he won the Sundance Film Festival Audience Award and was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize.\n\n\nIn 2012, he wrote, directed and starred in his second film, *Liberal Arts*, which premiered at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival. In 2014, Radnor portrayed Isaac in the Broadway play *Disgraced*, which was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Play. He then starred as Dr. Jedediah Foster on the PBS American Civil War drama series *Mercy Street*, Lou Mazzuchelli in the musical series *Rise*, and as Lonny Flash in *Hunters*.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nRadnor was born in Columbus, Ohio to a Jewish family, the son of Carol Radnor (née Hirsch), a high school guidance counselor, and Alan Radnor, a medical malpractice lawyer.[2] Radnor has two sisters, Melanie Radnor Silverman and Joanna Radnor Vilensky.[3]\n\n\nHe grew up in Bexley, Ohio, a suburb of Columbus, and was raised in Conservative Judaism.[4] He attended the Orthodox Jewish day school Columbus Torah Academy before going to Bexley High School[5][6][7] and then Kenyon College, where his school's theater department presented him with the Paul Newman Award and during which he spent a semester (Spring 1995) training at the National Theater Institute at the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center in Waterford, Connecticut. He graduated from Kenyon with a Bachelor of Arts in drama in 1996.[8] Radnor received his Master of Fine Arts degree in acting from New York University's graduate acting program at the Tisch School of the Arts in 1999.[8][9] Radnor participated in an Israel experience program in Tzfat with Livnot U'Lehibanot in 1997.[5]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Radnor and Ben Lee performing\nRadnor was cast as the lead in The WB series *Off Centre*. However, the role was re-cast with Eddie Kaye Thomas before the first episode aired.[10] In 2002, he made his Broadway debut in the stage version of *The Graduate*, succeeding Jason Biggs, opposite Kathleen Turner and Alicia Silverstone. In 2004, Radnor starred in *The Paris Letter* alongside his future *How I Met Your Mother* co-star Neil Patrick Harris.[11] From 2005 to 2014, Radnor starred in *How I Met Your Mother*, his biggest role to date.\n\n\nIn July 2008, he starred opposite Jennifer Westfeldt in the premiere of the play *Finks*,[12] written by Joe Gilford and directed by Charlie Stratton for New York Stage and Film. Radnor made his directorial debut with the film *Happythankyoumoreplease*, where he was both the writer and star of the 2010 comedy-drama.[13]\nHis second directorial effort, *Liberal Arts*, starring himself and Elizabeth Olsen, premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 22, 2012.[14] Radnor appeared in the Broadway production of *Disgraced*, which opened October 23, 2014, at the Lyceum Theatre.[15][16] He is set to direct the sci-fi thriller film *The Leaves*.[17] Radnor is currently starring in the Amazon Prime series, *Hunters*, as Lonny Flash, and on Netflix's *Centaurworld*, as Durpleton.\n\n\nIn October 2016, Radnor also confirmed he is in a band, Radnor and Lee, with Australian musician Ben Lee. Radnor and Lee had known each other for \"twelve or thirteen years after meeting on the set of *How I Met Your Mother*\" eventually writing songs together.[18] Their debut album, *Radnor & Lee* was released on November 10, 2017,[19] \"receiving widespread praise across the board, and cementing the duo as an accomplished pair of artists,\" stated Rolling Stone.[20] On February 19, 2020, Spin announced Radnor and Lee's sophomore album, *Golden State*, out on Flower Moon Records, and premiered the first single \"Outside In.\"[21] American Songwriter later premiered the video for the album's 2nd single, \"Simple Harmony.\" Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the album's release date was pushed back to June 2020.[22]\n\n\nRadnor's debut solo EP, *One More Then I'll Let You Go,* was released on April 16, 2021, on Flower Moon Records. Rolling Stone premiered the first single, \"The High Road,\" March 10, 2021, calling it a \"gently lilting ballad about the breakdown of a friendship on which he sings... which features deep textures of piano, acoustic guitar, organ, and snapping fingers.\"[23] The EP's 2nd single, \"You Feel New,\" premiered on March 31, 2021, with features in Rolling Stone, NPR, American Songwriter and Paste Magazine.[24]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nIn 2008, Radnor told the *Los Angeles Times*, \"I do Transcendental Meditation, and part of the reason I chose my house is that I thought it would be a great place to meditate.\"[25]\n\n\nRadnor is an avid Cloud Cult fan. He collaborated with the band to make the film *The Seeker* in 2016. Radnor explained, \"What's true for me about a lot of music, but especially true for Cloud Cult's music, is that it stirs up the thing that's already in you and calls it out. If this film is able to do that, I'll sleep well at night.\"[26][27]\n\n\n\n## Filmography[edit]\n\n\n\n\nKey\n| †\n | Denotes productions that have not yet been released\n |\n\n\n### Film[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2001\n | *Not Another Teen Movie* | Tour Guide\n |  |\n| 2008\n | *The Negotiating Table* | WGA Negotiator\n | Short film\n |\n| 2010\n | *Happythankyoumoreplease* | Sam Wexler\n | Also director and writer\n |\n| 2012\n | *Liberal Arts* | Jesse Fisher\n | Also director, writer and producer\n |\n| 2013\n | *Afternoon Delight* | Jeff Boyardee\n |  |\n| 2013\n | *The Galapagos Affair: Satan Came to Eden* | John Garth (voice)\n | Documentary\n |\n| 2016\n | *The Seeker* | Father\n | Also executive producer\n |\n| 2018\n | *Social Animals* | Paul\n |  |\n| 2023\n | *Three Birthdays* | Rob\n |  |\n| 2023\n | *All Happy Families* |  |  |\n\n\n### Television[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2000\n | *Welcome to New York* | Doug\n | Episode: \"The Crier\"\n |\n| 2001\n | *Off Centre* | Mike Platt\n | Unaired pilot\n |\n| 2002\n | *Law & Order* | Robert Kitson\n | Episode: \"Access Nation\"\n |\n| 2002\n | *The Court* | Dylan Hirsch\n | 3 episodes\n |\n| 2003\n | *ER* | Keith\n | Episode: \"The Advocate\"\n |\n| 2003\n | *Six Feet Under* | Will Jaffe\n | Episode: \"The Trap\"\n |\n| 2003\n | *Miss Match* | Andrew Gilbert\n | Episode: \"I Got You Babe\"\n |\n| 2005\n | *Judging Amy* | Justin Barr\n | Episode: \"Too Little, Too Late\"\n |\n| 2005–14\n | *How I Met Your Mother* | Ted Mosby | Main role (208 episodes)\n |\n| 2007, 2009\n | *Family Guy* | Ted Mosby (voice)\n | Episodes: \"No Chris Left Behind\"\"Peter's Progress\"\n |\n| 2013\n | *Malviviendo* | Himself/cameo\n | Episode: \"La cosa está muy negra\"\n |\n| 2016–17\n | *Mercy Street* | Dr. Jedediah Foster\n | Main role (12 episodes)\n |\n| 2018\n | *Rise* | Lou Mazzuchelli\n | Main role (10 episodes)\n |\n| 2018\n | *Grey's Anatomy* | John\n | Episode: \"Momma Knows Best\"\n |\n| 2020–23\n | *Hunters* | Lonny Flash\n | Main role (18 episodes)\n |\n| 2021\n | *Centaurworld* | Durpleton (voice)\n | Main role (18 episodes)\n |\n| 2022\n | *Fleishman Is in Trouble* | Adam\n | Recurring\n |\n\n\n### Music videos[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year | Title | Artist | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2016 | \"Let Me Be Your Girl\" | Rachael Yamagata | Director[28] |\n| 2017 | \"Be Like the Being\" | Radnor and Lee | Director\n |\n| 2021 | \"Afternoon\" | Cinders | Director\n |\n\n\n### Stage[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Location\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2002\n | *The Graduate* | Benjamin Braddock\n | Plymouth Theatre[29] |\n| 2004\n | *The Paris Letter* | Sam Arlen / Young Sandy\n | Kirk Douglas Theater |\n| 2011\n | *She Loves Me* | Georg Nowack\n | Roundabout Theatre Company[29] |\n| 2014–2015\n | *Disgraced* | Isaac\n | Lyceum Theatre |\n| 2016\n | *The Babylon Line* | Aaron Port\n | Lincoln Center\n |\n| 2018\n | *Little Shop of Horrors* | Seymour Krelborn\n | Kennedy Center |\n\n\n## Awards and nominations[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Work\n | Award\n | Result\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2010\n | *Happythankyoumoreplease* | Sundance Film Festival Audience Award | Won\n |\n| Sundance Film Festival Grand Jury Award | Nominated\n |\n\n\n## Discography[edit]\n\n\n### Radnor and Lee[edit]\n\n\n* *Radnor and Lee* (2017, Gold Village Entertainment)\n* *Golden State* (2020, Flower Moon Records)\n\n\n### Solo[edit]\n\n\n* *One More Then I'll Let You Go* (2021, Flower Moon Records)\n\n\n* *Eulogy, Vol. 1* (2023, Optimal Grip)\n\n\n### Additional appearances[edit]\n\n\n* Paty Cantú & Josh Radnor – \"Mirame\" (2020, Universal Music Mexico)\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Happy birthday, Josh Radnor: See his star sign and read your horoscope\". *Hello!*.

In 2007, she appeared on Broadway as Alice Ashbrook in Helen Edmundson's award-winning adaptation of Jamila Gavin's novel *Coram Boy*.[8] In 2010, she starred in *That Face*,[9] and was nominated for a Lucille Lortel Award for Outstanding Lead Actress for her work in *Stunning*.[10]\n\n\nIn 2012, she received a Tony Award nomination for Best Actress in a Musical for her portrayal of Girl in *Once*, a musical in which she performed from 2011 to 2013.[11] Of her performance, Ben Brantley of the *New York Times* wrote: \"It’s not easy playing a winsome life force with a foreign accent. But Ms. Milioti has mastered the assignment brilliantly. She brings a new confidence to her portrayal, and an enhanced mixture of wit and wisdom, which suggests a maturity in youth, a fatalism hard won during an Eastern European childhood. And together she and Mr. Kazee exude a chemistry that is all the more achingly real for being so subdued.\"[12] Her *Once* performance, with fellow principal soloist Steve Kazee, earned the 2013 Grammy Award for Best Musical Theater Album. She also read aloud a short story for the 2011 *This American Life* episode \"Adventure\".[13] In 2012, she appeared on several songs of Glen Hansard's debut album *Rhythm and Repose*.\n\n\nIn 2013, Milioti was cast in the CBS sitcom *How I Met Your Mother* as the titular Mother, appearing for the first time in the season eight finale titled \"Something New\", and was promoted to a series regular for the show's ninth and final season.[14] Milioti portrayed Jordan Belfort's first wife, Teresa Petrillo, in the 2013 Martin Scorsese film *The Wolf of Wall Street*.[15] In February 2014, she was cast as Zelda, the female lead on NBC's comedy *A to Z* which premiered that October and aired for one season of 13 episodes.[16] In 2015, she co-starred on the second season of *FX's Fargo* as Betsy Solverson, the cancer-stricken wife of state trooper Lou Solverson and mother of future deputy Molly Solverson. In 2017, Milioti appeared in the fourth season of the sci-fi anthology show *Black Mirror* in the episode \"USS Callister\" as Nanette Cole, a newly employed game developer whose digital recreation becomes trapped in a virtual simulator game.[17]\n\n\nIn 2020, Milioti starred in the sci-fi/comedy *Palm Springs*, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January and on Hulu in July.[18] In 2021, she starred in the HBO Max dark comedy series *Made for Love* as the entrapped wife of a tech billionaire from whom she runs away.[19]\n\n\nIn 2024, Milioti is set to star as Sofia Falcone in the Max spin-off miniseries of *The Batman* titled *The Penguin*, opposite Colin Farrell.[20][21]\n\n\n\n## Acting credits[edit]\n\n\n### Film[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2007\n | *Greetings from the Shore* | Didi\n |  |\n| 2009\n | *Year of the Carnivore* | Sammy Smalls\n |  |\n| 2012\n | *Sleepwalk with Me* | Janet Pandamiglio\n |  |\n| *I Am Ben* | The Journalist\n |  |\n| *The Brass Teapot* | Brandi\n |  |\n| 2013\n | *Bert and Arnie's Guide to Friendship* | Faye\n |  |\n| *The Wolf of Wall Street* | Teresa Petrillo Belfort\n |  |\n| 2014\n | *The Occupants* | Lucy\n |  |\n| 2015\n | *It Had to Be You* | Sonia\n |  |\n| 2017\n | *Breakable You* | Maud Weller\n |  |\n| 2020\n | *Palm Springs* | Sarah Wilder\n |  |\n\n\n### Television[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2006\n | *3 lbs* | Megan Rafferty\n | Episode: \"Bad Boys\"\n |\n| 2006–2007\n | *The Sopranos* | Catherine Sacrimoni | 3 episodes\n |\n| 2009\n | *The Unusuals* | Sketch Artist\n | 2 episodes\n |\n| 2010\n | *The Good Wife* | Onya Eggertson\n | Episode: \"Taking Control\"\n |\n| 2011\n | *30 Rock* | Abby Flynn/Abby Grossman\n | Episode: \"TGS Hates Women\"\n |\n| *Nurse Jackie* | Monica\n | Episode: \"...Deaf Blind Tumor Pee-Test\"\n |\n| 2013–2014\n | *How I Met Your Mother* | Tracy McConnell / The Mother | Guest role (season 8), main role (season 9)\n |\n| 2014–2015\n | *A to Z* | Zelda Vasco\n | Main role\n |\n| 2015\n | *Family Guy* | Becca\n | Voice role Episode: \"Roasted Guy\"\n |\n| *Fargo* | Betsy Solverson\n | Recurring role (season 2), 9 episodes\n |\n| 2015–2016\n | *The Mindy Project* | Whitney\n | Recurring role, 5 episodes\n |\n| 2016–2018\n | *The Venture Bros.* | Sirena / various voices\n | Recurring voice role, 8 episodes\n |\n| 2017\n | *Black Mirror* | Nanette Cole\n | Episode: \"USS *Callister*\"\n |\n| 2018\n | *No Activity* | Frankie\n | Main role (season 2)\n |\n| 2019\n | *Modern Love* | Maggie Mitchell\n | Episode: \"When the Doorman Is Your Main Man\"\n |\n| 2020\n | *Mythic Quest: Raven's Banquet* | Bean\n | Episode: \"A Dark Quiet Death\"\n |\n| *Death to 2020* | Kathy Flowers\n | Television special\n |\n| 2021\n | *Ziwe* | Friend\n | Episode: \"55%\"\n |\n| *The Simpsons* | Barb\n | Voice role Episode: \"A Serious Flanders\"\n |\n| *Death to 2021* | Kathy Flowers\n | Television special\n |\n| 2021–2022\n | *Made for Love* | Hazel Green\n | Main role\n |\n| 2022\n | *The Resort* | Emma Reed\n | Main role\n |\n| 2023\n | *Bob's Burgers* | Alice\n | Voice role Episode: \"Radio No You Didn't\"\n |\n| 2024\n | *The Penguin* | Sofia Falcone | Upcoming limited series\n |\n\n\n### Theatre[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Venue(s)\n | Refs. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2006\n | *The Lieutenant of Inishmore* | Mairead (understudy)\n | Lyceum Theatre   New York City, NY  |  |\n| 2007\n | *Coram Boy* | Alice Ashbrook\n | Imperial Theatre   New York City, NY  | [8] |\n| *The Devil's Disciple* | Essie\n | Irish Repertory Theatre   New York City, NY  |  |\n| 2008\n | *Crooked* | Laney\n |  |  |\n| *Some Americans Abroad* | Katie Taylor\n |  |  |\n| 2009\n | *The Retributionists* | Dinchka Fried\n |  |  |\n| *The Heart is a Lonely Hunter* | Mick Kelly\n | New York Theatre Workshop   New York City, NY  | [22] |\n| *Stunning* | Lily\n | Lincoln Center Theater   New York City, NY  | [23] |\n| 2010\n | *The Little Foxes* | Alexandra\n | New York Theatre Workshop   New York City, NY  | [24] |\n| *That Face* | Mia\n | Manhattan Theatre Club   New York City, NY  | [25] |\n| 2011\n | *Once* | Girl\n | American Repertory Theatre   Cambridge, MA  |  |\n| New York Theatre Workshop   New York City, NY  |  |\n| 2012–2013\n | Bernard B.

The series, which aired from September 19, 2005 to March 31, 2014, follows the main character, Ted Mosby, and his group of friends in New York City's Manhattan. As a framing device, Ted, in 2030, recounts to his son, Luke, and daughter, Penny, the events from September 2005 to May 2013 that led him to meet their mother. *How I Met Your Mother* was a joint production by Bays & Thomas Productions and 20th Century Fox Television, and syndicated by 20th Television (now Disney-ABC Domestic Television).\n\n\nThe series was loosely inspired by Thomas and Bays' friendship when they both lived in New York.[1] The vast majority of the episodes (196 out of 208) were directed by Pamela Fryman. The other directors were Rob Greenberg (7 episodes), Michael Shea (4 episodes), and Neil Patrick Harris (1 episode).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nKnown for its unique structure, humor, and incorporation of dramatic elements, *How I Met Your Mother* was popular throughout its run. It received positive reviews initially, but reception became more mixed as the seasons went on.[2][3][4] The show was nominated for 91 awards and received 21. In 2010, Alyson Hannigan won the People's Choice Award for Favorite TV Comedy Actress. In 2012, seven years after its premiere, the series won the People's Choice Award for Favorite Network TV Comedy, and Neil Patrick Harris won the award for Favorite TV Comedy Actor twice.\n\n\n\n\n## Premise[edit]\n\n\nThe series follows the adventures of Ted Mosby (played by Josh Radnor) and his love life as a single man. His stories are narrated by Bob Saget as Ted Mosby 25 years later as he tells them to his children.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| *How I Met Your Mother* |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)The cast pictured in the opening sequence\n |\n| Genre | * Sitcom\n* Romantic comedy\n* Comedy drama\n |\n| Created by | * Carter Bays\n* Craig Thomas\n |\n| Starring | * Josh Radnor\n* Jason Segel\n* Cobie Smulders\n* Neil Patrick Harris\n* Alyson Hannigan\n* Cristin Milioti\n |\n| Narrated by | Bob Saget |\n| Opening theme | \"Hey, Beautiful\" by The Solids |\n| Composer | John Swihart |\n| Country of origin | United States |\n| Original language | English |\n| No. of seasons | 9 |\n| No. of episodes | 208 (list of episodes) |\n| Production |\n| Executive producers | * Carter Bays\n* Craig Thomas\n* Rob Greenberg\n* Pamela Fryman\n* Eileen Heisler\n* DeAnn Heline\n* Phil Lord\n* Greg Malins\n* Christopher Miller\n* Chris Harris\n* Stephen Lloyd\n* Kourtney Kang\n* Jamie Rhonheimer\n* Chuck Tatham\n |\n| Producers | * Randy Cordray\n* Suzy Mamann Greenberg\n* Chris Harris\n* Jamie Rhonheimer\n* Kourtney Kang\n* Brenda Hsueh\n* Theresa Mulligan Rosenthal\n* Stewart Halpern-Fingerhut\n* Rob Greenberg\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n36. **^** \"CBS announces 2011–2012 premiere dates\" (Press release).

At the end of the fourth season only 88 episodes had been produced, and a further 22 episodes were required, ensuring that there would be a fifth season.[29] There also was a complication with the writing of the show because of actress Alyson Hannigan's absence due to her pregnancy; in response, the writers had to create episodes that did not include one of the five main characters.[30] On May 19, 2009, the fifth-season renewal was announced.[31] May 20, 2009, CBS announced that *How I Met Your Mother* would again be aired at 8 pm, leading into the new comedy *Accidentally on Purpose*. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"TV Summer School: How to Create and Run a Successful Sitcom\". *E!

Ted is based loosely on Bays, and Marshall and Lily are based loosely on Thomas and his wife.[5][6] Thomas' wife Rebecca was initially reluctant to have a character based on her but agreed if they could get Alyson Hannigan to play her. Hannigan was looking to do more comedy work and was available.[5] Josh Radnor and Jason Segel, who were cast as Ted and Marshall, respectively, were not well known, although Segel had been a cast member on the short-lived *Freaks and Geeks* and a recurring guest star on Judd Apatow's follow-up show, *Undeclared*. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n23. **^** Ryan, Maureen (July 19, 2008). \"Barney writes a book, Barney + Robin, Ted + Stella and other 'How I Met Your Mother' news\". *Chicago Tribune*.

He is best known for portraying Ted Mosby on the Emmy Award–winning CBS sitcom *How I Met Your Mother*. He made his writing and directorial debut with the 2010 comedy drama film *Happythankyoumoreplease*, for which he won the Sundance Film Festival Audience Award and was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize.\n\n\nIn 2012, he wrote, directed and starred in his second film, *Liberal Arts*, which premiered at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival. In 2014, Radnor portrayed Isaac in the Broadway play *Disgraced*, which was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Play. He then starred as Dr. Jedediah Foster on the PBS American Civil War drama series *Mercy Street*, Lou Mazzuchelli in the musical series *Rise*, and as Lonny Flash in *Hunters*.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nRadnor was born in Columbus, Ohio to a Jewish family, the son of Carol Radnor (née Hirsch), a high school guidance counselor, and Alan Radnor, a medical malpractice lawyer.[2] Radnor has two sisters, Melanie Radnor Silverman and Joanna Radnor Vilensky.[3]\n\n\nHe grew up in Bexley, Ohio, a suburb of Columbus, and was raised in Conservative Judaism.[4] He attended the Orthodox Jewish day school Columbus Torah Academy before going to Bexley High School[5][6][7] and then Kenyon College, where his school's theater department presented him with the Paul Newman Award and during which he spent a semester (Spring 1995) training at the National Theater Institute at the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center in Waterford, Connecticut. He graduated from Kenyon with a Bachelor of Arts in drama in 1996.[8] Radnor received his Master of Fine Arts degree in acting from New York University's graduate acting program at the Tisch School of the Arts in 1999.[8][9] Radnor participated in an Israel experience program in Tzfat with Livnot U'Lehibanot in 1997.[5]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Radnor and Ben Lee performing\nRadnor was cast as the lead in The WB series *Off Centre*. However, the role was re-cast with Eddie Kaye Thomas before the first episode aired.[10] In 2002, he made his Broadway debut in the stage version of *The Graduate*, succeeding Jason Biggs, opposite Kathleen Turner and Alicia Silverstone. In 2004, Radnor starred in *The Paris Letter* alongside his future *How I Met Your Mother* co-star Neil Patrick Harris.[11] From 2005 to 2014, Radnor starred in *How I Met Your Mother*, his biggest role to date.\n\n\nIn July 2008, he starred opposite Jennifer Westfeldt in the premiere of the play *Finks*,[12] written by Joe Gilford and directed by Charlie Stratton for New York Stage and Film. Radnor made his directorial debut with the film *Happythankyoumoreplease*, where he was both the writer and star of the 2010 comedy-drama.[13]\nHis second directorial effort, *Liberal Arts*, starring himself and Elizabeth Olsen, premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 22, 2012.[14] Radnor appeared in the Broadway production of *Disgraced*, which opened October 23, 2014, at the Lyceum Theatre.[15][16] He is set to direct the sci-fi thriller film *The Leaves*.[17] Radnor is currently starring in the Amazon Prime series, *Hunters*, as Lonny Flash, and on Netflix's *Centaurworld*, as Durpleton.\n\n\nIn October 2016, Radnor also confirmed he is in a band, Radnor and Lee, with Australian musician Ben Lee. Radnor and Lee had known each other for \"twelve or thirteen years after meeting on the set of *How I Met Your Mother*\" eventually writing songs together.[18] Their debut album, *Radnor & Lee* was released on November 10, 2017,[19] \"receiving widespread praise across the board, and cementing the duo as an accomplished pair of artists,\" stated Rolling Stone.[20] On February 19, 2020, Spin announced Radnor and Lee's sophomore album, *Golden State*, out on Flower Moon Records, and premiered the first single \"Outside In.\"[21] American Songwriter later premiered the video for the album's 2nd single, \"Simple Harmony.\" Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the album's release date was pushed back to June 2020.[22]\n\n\nRadnor's debut solo EP, *One More Then I'll Let You Go,* was released on April 16, 2021, on Flower Moon Records. Rolling Stone premiered the first single, \"The High Road,\" March 10, 2021, calling it a \"gently lilting ballad about the breakdown of a friendship on which he sings... which features deep textures of piano, acoustic guitar, organ, and snapping fingers.\"[23] The EP's 2nd single, \"You Feel New,\" premiered on March 31, 2021, with features in Rolling Stone, NPR, American Songwriter and Paste Magazine.[24]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nIn 2008, Radnor told the *Los Angeles Times*, \"I do Transcendental Meditation, and part of the reason I chose my house is that I thought it would be a great place to meditate.\"[25]\n\n\nRadnor is an avid Cloud Cult fan. He collaborated with the band to make the film *The Seeker* in 2016. Radnor explained, \"What's true for me about a lot of music, but especially true for Cloud Cult's music, is that it stirs up the thing that's already in you and calls it out. If this film is able to do that, I'll sleep well at night.\"[26][27]\n\n\n\n## Filmography[edit]\n\n\n\n\nKey\n| †\n | Denotes productions that have not yet been released\n |\n\n\n### Film[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2001\n | *Not Another Teen Movie* | Tour Guide\n |  |\n| 2008\n | *The Negotiating Table* | WGA Negotiator\n | Short film\n |\n| 2010\n | *Happythankyoumoreplease* | Sam Wexler\n | Also director and writer\n |\n| 2012\n | *Liberal Arts* | Jesse Fisher\n | Also director, writer and producer\n |\n| 2013\n | *Afternoon Delight* | Jeff Boyardee\n |  |\n| 2013\n | *The Galapagos Affair: Satan Came to Eden* | John Garth (voice)\n | Documentary\n |\n| 2016\n | *The Seeker* | Father\n | Also executive producer\n |\n| 2018\n | *Social Animals* | Paul\n |  |\n| 2023\n | *Three Birthdays* | Rob\n |  |\n| 2023\n | *All Happy Families* |  |  |\n\n\n### Television[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2000\n | *Welcome to New York* | Doug\n | Episode: \"The Crier\"\n |\n| 2001\n | *Off Centre* | Mike Platt\n | Unaired pilot\n |\n| 2002\n | *Law & Order* | Robert Kitson\n | Episode: \"Access Nation\"\n |\n| 2002\n | *The Court* | Dylan Hirsch\n | 3 episodes\n |\n| 2003\n | *ER* | Keith\n | Episode: \"The Advocate\"\n |\n| 2003\n | *Six Feet Under* | Will Jaffe\n | Episode: \"The Trap\"\n |\n| 2003\n | *Miss Match* | Andrew Gilbert\n | Episode: \"I Got You Babe\"\n |\n| 2005\n | *Judging Amy* | Justin Barr\n | Episode: \"Too Little, Too Late\"\n |\n| 2005–14\n | *How I Met Your Mother* | Ted Mosby | Main role (208 episodes)\n |\n| 2007, 2009\n | *Family Guy* | Ted Mosby (voice)\n | Episodes: \"No Chris Left Behind\"\"Peter's Progress\"\n |\n| 2013\n | *Malviviendo* | Himself/cameo\n | Episode: \"La cosa está muy negra\"\n |\n| 2016–17\n | *Mercy Street* | Dr. Jedediah Foster\n | Main role (12 episodes)\n |\n| 2018\n | *Rise* | Lou Mazzuchelli\n | Main role (10 episodes)\n |\n| 2018\n | *Grey's Anatomy* | John\n | Episode: \"Momma Knows Best\"\n |\n| 2020–23\n | *Hunters* | Lonny Flash\n | Main role (18 episodes)\n |\n| 2021\n | *Centaurworld* | Durpleton (voice)\n | Main role (18 episodes)\n |\n| 2022\n | *Fleishman Is in Trouble* | Adam\n | Recurring\n |\n\n\n### Music videos[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year | Title | Artist | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2016 | \"Let Me Be Your Girl\" | Rachael Yamagata | Director[28] |\n| 2017 | \"Be Like the Being\" | Radnor and Lee | Director\n |\n| 2021 | \"Afternoon\" | Cinders | Director\n |\n\n\n### Stage[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Location\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2002\n | *The Graduate* | Benjamin Braddock\n | Plymouth Theatre[29] |\n| 2004\n | *The Paris Letter* | Sam Arlen / Young Sandy\n | Kirk Douglas Theater |\n| 2011\n | *She Loves Me* | Georg Nowack\n | Roundabout Theatre Company[29] |\n| 2014–2015\n | *Disgraced* | Isaac\n | Lyceum Theatre |\n| 2016\n | *The Babylon Line* | Aaron Port\n | Lincoln Center\n |\n| 2018\n | *Little Shop of Horrors* | Seymour Krelborn\n | Kennedy Center |\n\n\n## Awards and nominations[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Work\n | Award\n | Result\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2010\n | *Happythankyoumoreplease* | Sundance Film Festival Audience Award | Won\n |\n| Sundance Film Festival Grand Jury Award | Nominated\n |\n\n\n## Discography[edit]\n\n\n### Radnor and Lee[edit]\n\n\n* *Radnor and Lee* (2017, Gold Village Entertainment)\n* *Golden State* (2020, Flower Moon Records)\n\n\n### Solo[edit]\n\n\n* *One More Then I'll Let You Go* (2021, Flower Moon Records)\n\n\n* *Eulogy, Vol. 1* (2023, Optimal Grip)\n\n\n### Additional appearances[edit]\n\n\n* Paty Cantú & Josh Radnor – \"Mirame\" (2020, Universal Music Mexico)\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Happy birthday, Josh Radnor: See his star sign and read your horoscope\". *Hello!*.

For his performance he earned a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series nomination.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nSegel was born on January 18, 1980, in Los Angeles, California, to Jillian (née Jordan; born 1952) and Alvin Segel, a lawyer.[1][2][3][4] He grew up in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood.[5] He has an older brother, Adam,[1][6] and a younger sister, Alison.[7]\n\n\nSegel's father is Jewish,[8][9][10] whereas his mother is of English, Scottish, Irish, and French descent.[11] He has stated that he was raised Jewish,[12] as well as \"a little bit of everything\".[13] Segel went to Hebrew school and had a Bar Mitzvah ceremony, and also attended St. Matthew's Parish School, a private Episcopal school.[9][14][15]\n\n\nFollowing elementary school and middle school, Segel completed his high school studies at Harvard-Westlake School, where his 6 ft 4 in (1.93 m) frame helped him as an active member of the 1996 and 1997 CIF state champion boys' basketball team.[16][17] He won a slam dunk contest in high school[18] and he was nicknamed \"Dr. Dunk.\"[19] He was a backup to the team's star center, Jason Collins, who went on to play in the NBA.[16]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n![A man holds a microphone as he speaks](image)Segel at the Austin premiere of *I Love You, Man* in 2009\nSegel's first major role was as stoner \"freak\" Nick Andopolis on the critically acclaimed but short-lived 1999 NBC comedy-drama series *Freaks and Geeks*. The series revolved around a group of suburban Detroit high school students circa 1980. Segel personally composed a song for his character, Nick, to sing to the lead female character, Lindsay (Linda Cardellini).[20]\n\n\nSegel had recurring roles on *CSI: Crime Scene Investigation* as Neil Jansen and on *Undeclared* as Eric. He played Marshall Eriksen on the CBS sitcom *How I Met Your Mother*; he had previously stated he would move on to other projects in 2013 when his contract expired,[21] but was convinced to finish the series after its ninth season in 2014.[22]\n\n\nSegel made his film debut with *Can't Hardly Wait* in 1998. His other early feature film appearances include *Slackers*, *SLC Punk!*, *The Good Humor Man*, and *Dead Man on Campus*. In 2007, he appeared in *Knocked Up*, directed by *Freaks and Geeks* producer Judd Apatow. Segel starred in the lead role of 2008's *Forgetting Sarah Marshall*, a film he wrote and Apatow produced with Shauna Robertson for Universal Pictures. He also starred in *I Love You, Man*, which was released on March 20, 2009, by DreamWorks.[23]\n\n\nIn *Forgetting Sarah Marshall*, Segel's character writes a \"Dracula\" musical performed by puppets. He also appeared in the most prominent scene containing full frontal nudity in the film.[24] In an interview,[25] he stated that the Dracula musical with puppets, as well as being broken up with while naked, were real experiences he wrote into the movie. Those cloth creatures were custom-made by the Jim Henson Company, and the experience emboldened Segel to pitch his concept for a Muppets movie.[26] Segel performed a song from the film, \"Dracula's Lament\", on the 1000th episode of *The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson*.[27]\n\n\n\n![A man smiles as he waves](image)Segel at the Australian premiere of *The Muppets* in Sydney in 2011\nFor the 2010 comedy *Get Him to the Greek*, Segel co-wrote most of the soundtrack's music which was performed by the fictional celebrity singer, Aldous Snow, including Infant Sorrow. He also appeared on *The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson* and sang an original song entitled \"Wonky Eyed Girl\".[28]\n\n\nIn 2010, he voiced Gru's arch-rival Vector in the Universal's CGI animated film, *Despicable Me* and appeared as \"Horatio\" in a fantasy comedy film *Gulliver's Travels* directed by Rob Letterman and very loosely based on Part One of the 18th-century novel of the same name by Jonathan Swift. Segel appeared in *Bad Teacher*, starring Cameron Diaz, which opened in June 2011. He played gym teacher and thwarted suitor Russell Gettis.[29] Along with Nicholas Stoller, Segel approached Disney in 2007 to write the latest *Muppets* film. Disney was unsure on how to take the request, as Segel had just done frontal nudity in *Forgetting Sarah Marshall*, but after realizing that he was a fan, the project was approved. Segel stated that he wanted to do the film because the last film in the series to be released in theaters was *Muppets from Space* in 1999, and he felt that the younger generation was missing out on enjoying one of his childhood favorites.[30]\n\n\nSegel decided not to star in the sequel to *The Muppets*, *Muppets Most Wanted*.[31] He filmed *The Five-Year Engagement*, with Emily Blunt, in spring 2011, in Michigan, and the film was released on April 27, 2012.[32]\n\n\nIn 2013, Segel revealed he was working on a series of young adult novels, based on a story he conceived when he was 21.[33] In the fall of 2014, the first novel of the series *Nightmares!*, co-written with Kirsten Miller, was released, with the followup coming out the following year.[34][35]\n\n\nIn 2015, Segel received praise[36][37][38] for his portrayal of the late author David Foster Wallace in the independent biographical drama film *The End of the Tour*. For his performance, he earned an Independent Spirit Award nomination for Best Male Lead.[39]\n\n\nIn 2017, Segel and Miller released a new book, *Otherworld*, the first of a new young adult series. A second book in the series, *OtherEarth*, was released in 2018, and a third novel, *OtherLife*, in 2019. Segel created and starred in the American drama television series *Dispatches from Elsewhere*, which premiered on March 1, 2020, on AMC.\n\n\nIn 2019, Segel starred in *Our Friend* based on Matthew Teague's 2015 essay \"The Friend\".[40]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nSegel is an ordained minister with the Universal Life Church.[41] He performed a wedding ceremony on *The Tonight Show* on July 6, 2010, for a couple that solicited his services by placing pictures of him around his hometown and the bar he frequently visited.[42]\n\n\nSegel dated his *Freaks and Geeks* co-star Linda Cardellini for several years following the show's cancellation.[43] He dated Michelle Williams from 2012 to 2013.[44] From December 2013 to April 2021, Segel dated photographer Alexis Mixter.[45][46]\n\n\n\n## Filmography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Segel, Neil Patrick Harris and Joss Whedon in 2011\n### Film[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1998\n | *Can't Hardly Wait* | Matt\n |  |\n| 1998\n | *Dead Man on Campus* | Kyle\n |  |\n| 1998\n | *SLC Punk!* | Mike\n |  |\n| 2002\n | *Slackers* | Sam Schechter\n |  |\n| 2003\n | *11:14* | Leon (Paramedic #1)\n |  |\n| 2003\n | *Certainly Not a Fairytale* | Leo\n |  |\n| 2004\n | *LolliLove* | Jason\n |  |\n| 2005\n | *The Good Humor Man* | Smelly Bob\n |  |\n| 2006\n | *Bye Bye Benjamin* | Theodore Everest\n |  |\n| 2006\n | *Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny* | Frat Boy\n | Deleted scenes\n |\n| 2007\n | *Knocked Up* | Jason\n |  |\n| 2008\n | *Forgetting Sarah Marshall* | Peter Bretter\n | Also writer |\n| 2009\n | *I Love You, Man* | Sydney Fife\n |  |\n| 2010\n | *Despicable Me* | Victor \"Vector\" Perkins (voice)\n |  |\n| 2010\n | *Gulliver's Travels* | Horatio\n |  |\n| 2011\n | *Bad Teacher* | Russell Gettis\n |  |\n| 2011\n | *Friends with Benefits* | Brice\n | Uncredited cameo\n |\n| 2011\n | *Jeff, Who Lives at Home* | Jeff Thompkins\n |  |\n| 2011\n | *The Muppets* | Gary\n | Also writer and executive producer |\n| 2012\n | *The Five-Year Engagement* | Tom Solomon\n | Also writer and executive producer\n |\n| 2012\n | *This Is 40* | Jason\n |  |\n| 2013\n | *This Is the End* | Himself\n | Uncredited cameo\n |\n| 2014\n | *Sex Tape* | Jay Hargrove\n | Also writer and executive producer\n |\n| 2015\n | *The End of the Tour* | David Foster Wallace |  |\n| 2017\n | *The Discovery* | Will Harbor\n |  |\n| 2018\n | *Come Sunday* | Henry\n |  |\n| 2019\n | *Our Friend*[47] | Dane Faucheux\n |  |\n| 2022\n | *The Sky Is Everywhere*[48] | Big Walker\n |  |\n| 2022\n | *Windfall*[49] | Nobody\n | Also story writer and producer\n |\n\n\n### Television[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1999–2000\n | *Freaks and Geeks* | Nick Andopolis | Main role;

She is known for her starring role as Robin Scherbatsky in the CBS sitcom *How I Met Your Mother* (2005–2014) and as S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Maria Hill in the Marvel Cinematic Universe superhero franchise, from the film *The Avengers* (2012) until the Disney+ limited series *Secret Invasion* (2023).\n\n\nSmulders' other films include *Safe Haven* (2013), *The Lego Movie* (2014), *Results* (2015), *The Intervention* (2016), *Jack Reacher: Never Go Back* (2016), and *The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part* (2019). She also starred in the Netflix comedy drama series *A Series of Unfortunate Events* (2017), the Netflix comedy series *Friends from College* (2017–2019), the ABC crime drama series *Stumptown* (2019–2020), and the FX true crime series *Impeachment: American Crime Story* (2021).\n\n\nSmulders made her theater debut in the off-Broadway production of the Nora Ephron play *Love, Loss, and What I Wore* in 2010. She then made her Broadway debut in the revival of the Noël Coward comedy *Present Laughter* (2017) earning a Theater World Award. \n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nSmulders was born in Vancouver, British Columbia, to a Dutch father and a British mother. She was raised in White Rock, British Columbia, and later moved to the affluent West Point Grey neighbourhood to attend high school at Lord Byng Secondary School. She was named after her great-aunt, from whom she gained the nickname \"Cobie\".[3] Smulders describes herself as \"a fluent listener\" of French.[4] She has four sisters.[5] Smulders was also a member of the Girl Guides of Canada as a child, participating as a Brownie (Girl Guide program for 7- to 10-year-olds).[6] In her youth, Smulders aspired to be a marine biologist.[4] She took an interest in theatre throughout high school and briefly studied at the University of Victoria before returning to acting.[4]\n\n\n\n### Modeling[edit]\n\n\nSmulders worked in modeling, which she later said she \"kind of hated\", adding that the experience made her hesitant about pursuing acting as a career: \"You know, you go into these rooms, and I've had the experience of people judging you physically for so long and I was over that but, then it was like... 'Oh no, I have to actually perform. I have to do well, and I have to have a voice... and I have to have thoughts now.'\"[7]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### 2002–2016: Early roles and breakthrough[edit]\n\n\n![A brunette woman smiles](image)Smulders at a CBS event in 2008\nSmulders made her professional acting debut in 2002, with guest appearances in the UPN science fiction comedy series *Special Unit 2* and the Showtime science fiction drama series *Jeremiah*. She subsequently made multiple appearances on television, including in the Fox supernatural drama series *Tru Calling* (2003), the WB superhero series *Smallville* (2003), and the Global space opera series *Andromeda* (2005). Smulders' first role as a series regular was in the short-lived 2003 ABC adventure drama series *Veritas: The Quest*, which ran for one season. She made her film debut in 2004 with a supporting role in the action film *Walking Tall*. She then had a supporting role in the 2005 comedy film *The Long Weekend*.

The series concluded in 2014 after nine seasons, winning 10 Emmy Awards throughout its run.[8] For her performance, she garnered wide recognition and earned a People's Choice Award nomination.[9] In 2009, she appeared in the comedy film *The Slammin' Salmon*. She then appeared in the 2010 pilot episode of the HBO comedy-drama series *How to Make It in America*. In June 2010, Smulders made her off-Broadway debut in Delia and Nora Ephron's play *Love, Loss, and What I Wore* at the Westside Theatre.[10] She went on to star in the 2012 political comedy film *Grassroots*.\n\n\n\n![A brunette woman smiles at the camera](image)Smulders at the 2013 San Diego Comic-Con\nSmulders gained further recognition for starring as S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Maria Hill in the Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise, beginning with the 2012 superhero action film *The Avengers*. She received training from a Los Angeles SWAT team trainer to handle guns to portray the character.[11] Smulders reprised the role in three episodes of the ABC superhero television series *Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.* (2013–2015),[12] and in the films *Captain America: The Winter Soldier* (2014), *Avengers: Age of Ultron* (2015), *Avengers: Infinity War* (2018), *Avengers: Endgame* (2019), and *Spider-Man: Far From Home* (2019).[13][14] In 2013, she appeared in an episode of the comedy series *Comedy Bang! Bang!*.

It was the first time the Wonder Woman character had a theatrical film appearance.[16]\n\n\nIn July 2015, she was reported to have exited the television film *Confirmation* because she had broken her leg; Zoe Lister-Jones was then confirmed to replace her in the role of Harriet Grant.[17] In 2015, Smulders starred in the drama film *Unexpected* and the romantic comedy *Results*. She also appeared in the documentary film *Being Canadian* and guest starred in the NBC variety series *Best Time Ever with Neil Patrick Harris*.

Marilyn Stasio of *Variety* praised Smulders in the role writing, \"Smulders has a graceful, Cowardian air in the role, and makes Susan Hilferty’s costumes look even more fabulous.\"[18] David Rooney of *The Hollywood Reporter* wrote, \"Smulders looks sensational; she’s the epitome of late-’30s elegance...she carries herself with poise and assurance\".[19] For her performance she was honored with a Theatre World Award for Outstanding Broadway debut. Her performance was filmed with *Great Performances* and shown on PBS.[20]\n\n\nAlso in 2017, she portrayed the recurring character of \"Mother\", also known as Mrs. Quagmire, in the Netflix black comedy drama series *A Series of Unfortunate Events*, based on the book series of the same name.[21] That same year, she appeared in the comedy films *Literally, Right Before Aaron* and *Killing Gunther*. From 2017 to 2019, she starred in the Netflix comedy series *Friends from College*, in the main role of Lisa Turner.[22] In 2018, she starred in the lead role of Joanne Skye in the comedy-drama film *Songbird*, also alternatively titled *Alright Now*. The film was improvised, and shot in the course of five days.[23] She then reprised her role as Wonder Woman in the 2019 animated sequel film *The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part.*\n\n\n\n![A brunette woman smiles](image)Smulders at the 2019 San Diego Comic-Con\nIn 2019, she guest starred as Young Lucille Bluth in three episodes of the Netflix sitcom *Arrested Development* and appeared in an episode of the HBO anthology series *Room 104*. She also starred as Dexedrine \"Dex\" Parios, a PTSD-stricken military veteran turned private detective, in the ABC crime drama series *Stumptown*, which premiered on September 25, 2019 to positive reviews.[24] She received a Critics' Choice Super Award for Best Actress in a Superhero Series nomination for her performance. The series was canceled after one season due to production delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.[25] In 2020, Smulders starred in the romantic drama film *Cicada* and voiced a guest appearance in the Fox animated sitcom *The Simpsons*. \n\n\nIn 2021, she portrayed media pundit Ann Coulter in the FX true crime anthology series *Impeachment: American Crime Story*, which received positive reviews from critics.[26] That same year, she had a voice role as Maria Hill in the Disney+ animated anthology series *What If...?*. In 2022, she reprised her role of Robin Scherbatsky in the first season finale of the *HIMYM* spinoff *How I Met Your Father*, which aired on Hulu.[27] Also in 2022, she starred in the Amazon Freevee coming-of-age drama series *High School*, based on the 2019 memoir of the same name by Tegan and Sara.[28]\n\n\nIn 2023, Smulders reprised her role as Maria Hill, voicing the character in the Disney Channel animated series *Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur* and appearing in the Disney+ limited series *Secret Invasion*.[29]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nSmulders became engaged to Taran Killam in January 2009 after meeting him at a mutual friend's party four years earlier.[30] They married on September 8, 2012, in Solvang, California.[31] The couple resides in Pacific Palisades, California.[32] They have two daughters, Shaelyn Cado Killam, born in 2009[33] and Janita Mae Killam, born in 2015.[34][35]\n\n\nIn 2015, Smulders revealed she had been diagnosed with ovarian cancer at age 25, while shooting season three of *How I Met Your Mother* in 2007. She had surgery to remove two tumors from her ovaries, but the cancer had spread to her lymph nodes, resulting in the need for multiple operations over the course of two years.[36][37] In August 2019, Smulders revealed she is in remission.[38]\n\n\nIn 2020, Smulders announced that she became an American citizen, while still retaining her Canadian citizenship. She stated that part of her motivation to become an American citizen was due to the 2020 presidential election.[39]\n\n\n\n### Charity work[edit]\n\n\nSmulders filmed a public service announcement with Oceana, an international ocean-conservation organization, in 2014.[40][41] In May 2020, she released a clip parodying \"Let's Go to the Mall\", a song her character performed on *How I Met Your Mother*, titled \"Let's All Stay at Home\", to encourage the public to enforce COVID-19 lockdowns. Smulders also encouraged fans to donate to Save the Children, Canada Helps and the Daily Bread Food Bank amidst the pandemic.[42]\n\n\n\n## Filmography[edit]\n\n\n### Film[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2004\n | *Walking Tall* | Exotic Beauty\n |  |\n| *Ill Fated* | Mary\n | [43] |\n| 2005\n | *The Long Weekend* | Ellen\n |  |\n| 2006\n | *Escape* | Psychotic Brunette\n | Short film\n |\n| *Dr. Miracles* | Mrs. Peterson\n | Short film[44] |\n| 2007\n | *The Storm Awaits* | Anabella DeLorenzo\n | Short film[45] |\n| 2009\n | *The Slammin' Salmon* | Tara\n |  |\n| 2012\n | *The Avengers* | Maria Hill |  |\n| *Grassroots* | Clair\n |  |\n| 2013\n | *Safe Haven* | Carly Jo Wheatley\n |  |\n| *Delivery Man* | Emma\n |  |\n| 2014\n | *The Lego Movie* | Wonder Woman | Voice\n |\n| *They Came Together* | Tiffany Amber Thigpen\n |  |\n| *Captain America: The Winter Soldier* | Maria Hill\n |  |\n| 2015\n | *Unexpected* | Samantha Abbot\n | [46] |\n| *Results* | Kat\n |  |\n| *Avengers: Age of Ultron* | Maria Hill\n |  |\n| *Being Canadian* | Herself\n | Documentary\n |\n| 2016\n | *The Intervention* | Ruby\n |  |\n| *Jack Reacher: Never Go Back* | Major Susan Turner\n |  |\n| 2017\n | *Literally, Right Before Aaron* | Allison\n |  |\n| *Killing Gunther* | Lisa McCalla\n |  |\n| 2018\n | *Avengers: Infinity War* | Maria Hill\n | Uncredited cameo; post-credits scene\n |\n| *Songbird* | Joanne Skye\n |  |\n| 2019\n | *The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part* | Wonder Woman\n | Voice\n |\n| *Avengers: Endgame* | Maria Hill\n | Cameo\n |\n| *Spider-Man: Far From Home* | [N 1] |\n| 2020\n | *Cicada* | Sophie\n |  |\n\n\n### Television[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2002\n | *Special Unit 2* | Zoe\n | Episode: \"The Wish\"\n |\n| 2002\n | *Jeremiah* | Deborah\n | Episode: \"Thieves' Honor\"\n |\n| 2003\n | *Tru Calling* | Sarah Webb\n | Episode: \"Brother's Keeper\"\n |\n| 2003\n | *Veritas: The Quest* | Juliet Droil\n | Main role; 13 episodes\n |\n| 2004\n | *Smallville* | Shannon Bell / Eve Andrews\n | Episode: \"Bound\"\n |\n| 2005\n | *Andromeda* | Jillian Rhade\n | 2 episodes: \"The Heart of the Journey (Parts 1 & 2)\"\n |\n| 2005\n | *The L Word* | Leigh Ostin\n | 4 episodes\n |\n| 2005–2014\n | *How I Met Your Mother* | Robin Scherbatsky | Main role; 208 episodes\n |\n| 2010\n | *How to Make It in America* | Hayley\n | Episode: \"Pilot\"\n |\n| 2013–2015\n | *Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.* | Maria Hill | 3 episodes\n |\n| 2013\n | *Comedy Bang!

She is known for playing Tracy McConnell in the CBS sitcom *How I Met Your Mother* from 2013 to 2014, and for her work in theater productions such as *That Face*, *Stunning*, and the Tony Award-winning musical *Once*, for which she won a Grammy Award and was nominated for a Tony Award. She has also played Teresa Petrillo Belfort in the 2013 film *The Wolf of Wall Street*, Sarah Wilder in the 2020 film *Palm Springs*, Betsy Solverson in the second season of *Fargo* (2015), Hazel Green in the HBO Max comedy series *Made for Love* (2021–2022), and Emma in the Peacock black comedy mystery series *The Resort* (2022).\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nMilioti was born on August 16, 1985, in Cherry Hill, New Jersey.[1] She is of Italian descent, and calls her family \"Olive Garden Italian\".[2] In middle school, she found her love of acting at Long Lake Camp for the Arts in Long Lake, New York.[3] She graduated in 2003 from Cherry Hill High School East, where she began performing in school plays.[4] She took acting classes at New York University, but dropped out during her sophomore year.[5][6] Milioti admitted that she was \"wildly unhappy there\" and dropped out as a result.[5]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n![Milioti strumming a ukulele onstage](image)Milioti playing ukulele in 2013.\nMilioti's first acting roles were bit parts in national advertising campaign ads, notably one for the Ford Edge.[7] She also appeared in television programs such as *The Sopranos* and films such as *Greetings from the Shore*. Milioti is also known for her stage performances. In 2007, she appeared on Broadway as Alice Ashbrook in Helen Edmundson's award-winning adaptation of Jamila Gavin's novel *Coram Boy*.[8] In 2010, she starred in *That Face*,[9] and was nominated for a Lucille Lortel Award for Outstanding Lead Actress for her work in *Stunning*.[10]\n\n\nIn 2012, she received a Tony Award nomination for Best Actress in a Musical for her portrayal of Girl in *Once*, a musical in which she performed from 2011 to 2013.[11] Of her performance, Ben Brantley of the *New York Times* wrote: \"It’s not easy playing a winsome life force with a foreign accent. But Ms. Milioti has mastered the assignment brilliantly. She brings a new confidence to her portrayal, and an enhanced mixture of wit and wisdom, which suggests a maturity in youth, a fatalism hard won during an Eastern European childhood. And together she and Mr. Kazee exude a chemistry that is all the more achingly real for being so subdued.\"[12] Her *Once* performance, with fellow principal soloist Steve Kazee, earned the 2013 Grammy Award for Best Musical Theater Album. She also read aloud a short story for the 2011 *This American Life* episode \"Adventure\".[13] In 2012, she appeared on several songs of Glen Hansard's debut album *Rhythm and Repose*.\n\n\nIn 2013, Milioti was cast in the CBS sitcom *How I Met Your Mother* as the titular Mother, appearing for the first time in the season eight finale titled \"Something New\", and was promoted to a series regular for the show's ninth and final season.[14] Milioti portrayed Jordan Belfort's first wife, Teresa Petrillo, in the 2013 Martin Scorsese film *The Wolf of Wall Street*.[15] In February 2014, she was cast as Zelda, the female lead on NBC's comedy *A to Z* which premiered that October and aired for one season of 13 episodes.[16] In 2015, she co-starred on the second season of *FX's Fargo* as Betsy Solverson, the cancer-stricken wife of state trooper Lou Solverson and mother of future deputy Molly Solverson. In 2017, Milioti appeared in the fourth season of the sci-fi anthology show *Black Mirror* in the episode \"USS Callister\" as Nanette Cole, a newly employed game developer whose digital recreation becomes trapped in a virtual simulator game.[17]\n\n\nIn 2020, Milioti starred in the sci-fi/comedy *Palm Springs*, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January and on Hulu in July.[18] In 2021, she starred in the HBO Max dark comedy series *Made for Love* as the entrapped wife of a tech billionaire from whom she runs away.[19]\n\n\nIn 2024, Milioti is set to star as Sofia Falcone in the Max spin-off miniseries of *The Batman* titled *The Penguin*, opposite Colin Farrell.[20][21]\n\n\n\n## Acting credits[edit]\n\n\n### Film[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2007\n | *Greetings from the Shore* | Didi\n |  |\n| 2009\n | *Year of the Carnivore* | Sammy Smalls\n |  |\n| 2012\n | *Sleepwalk with Me* | Janet Pandamiglio\n |  |\n| *I Am Ben* | The Journalist\n |  |\n| *The Brass Teapot* | Brandi\n |  |\n| 2013\n | *Bert and Arnie's Guide to Friendship* | Faye\n |  |\n| *The Wolf of Wall Street* | Teresa Petrillo Belfort\n |  |\n| 2014\n | *The Occupants* | Lucy\n |  |\n| 2015\n | *It Had to Be You* | Sonia\n |  |\n| 2017\n | *Breakable You* | Maud Weller\n |  |\n| 2020\n | *Palm Springs* | Sarah Wilder\n |  |\n\n\n### Television[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2006\n | *3 lbs* | Megan Rafferty\n | Episode: \"Bad Boys\"\n |\n| 2006–2007\n | *The Sopranos* | Catherine Sacrimoni | 3 episodes\n |\n| 2009\n | *The Unusuals* | Sketch Artist\n | 2 episodes\n |\n| 2010\n | *The Good Wife* | Onya Eggertson\n | Episode: \"Taking Control\"\n |\n| 2011\n | *30 Rock* | Abby Flynn/Abby Grossman\n | Episode: \"TGS Hates Women\"\n |\n| *Nurse Jackie* | Monica\n | Episode: \"...Deaf Blind Tumor Pee-Test\"\n |\n| 2013–2014\n | *How I Met Your Mother* | Tracy McConnell / The Mother | Guest role (season 8), main role (season 9)\n |\n| 2014–2015\n | *A to Z* | Zelda Vasco\n | Main role\n |\n| 2015\n | *Family Guy* | Becca\n | Voice role Episode: \"Roasted Guy\"\n |\n| *Fargo* | Betsy Solverson\n | Recurring role (season 2), 9 episodes\n |\n| 2015–2016\n | *The Mindy Project* | Whitney\n | Recurring role, 5 episodes\n |\n| 2016–2018\n | *The Venture Bros.* | Sirena / various voices\n | Recurring voice role, 8 episodes\n |\n| 2017\n | *Black Mirror* | Nanette Cole\n | Episode: \"USS *Callister*\"\n |\n| 2018\n | *No Activity* | Frankie\n | Main role (season 2)\n |\n| 2019\n | *Modern Love* | Maggie Mitchell\n | Episode: \"When the Doorman Is Your Main Man\"\n |\n| 2020\n | *Mythic Quest: Raven's Banquet* | Bean\n | Episode: \"A Dark Quiet Death\"\n |\n| *Death to 2020* | Kathy Flowers\n | Television special\n |\n| 2021\n | *Ziwe* | Friend\n | Episode: \"55%\"\n |\n| *The Simpsons* | Barb\n | Voice role Episode: \"A Serious Flanders\"\n |\n| *Death to 2021* | Kathy Flowers\n | Television special\n |\n| 2021–2022\n | *Made for Love* | Hazel Green\n | Main role\n |\n| 2022\n | *The Resort* | Emma Reed\n | Main role\n |\n| 2023\n | *Bob's Burgers* | Alice\n | Voice role Episode: \"Radio No You Didn't\"\n |\n| 2024\n | *The Penguin* | Sofia Falcone | Upcoming limited series\n |\n\n\n### Theatre[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Venue(s)\n | Refs. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2006\n | *The Lieutenant of Inishmore* | Mairead (understudy)\n | Lyceum Theatre   New York City, NY  |  |\n| 2007\n | *Coram Boy* | Alice Ashbrook\n | Imperial Theatre   New York City, NY  | [8] |\n| *The Devil's Disciple* | Essie\n | Irish Repertory Theatre   New York City, NY  |  |\n| 2008\n | *Crooked* | Laney\n |  |  |\n| *Some Americans Abroad* | Katie Taylor\n |  |  |\n| 2009\n | *The Retributionists* | Dinchka Fried\n |  |  |\n| *The Heart is a Lonely Hunter* | Mick Kelly\n | New York Theatre Workshop   New York City, NY  | [22] |\n| *Stunning* | Lily\n | Lincoln Center Theater   New York City, NY  | [23] |\n| 2010\n | *The Little Foxes* | Alexandra\n | New York Theatre Workshop   New York City, NY  | [24] |\n| *That Face* | Mia\n | Manhattan Theatre Club   New York City, NY  | [25] |\n| 2011\n | *Once* | Girl\n | American Repertory Theatre   Cambridge, MA  |  |\n| New York Theatre Workshop   New York City, NY  |  |\n| 2012–2013\n | Bernard B.
