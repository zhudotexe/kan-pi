However, they were growing tired of the monotony of numerous appearances at the same clubs night after night.[34] In November 1961, during one of the group's frequent performances at the Cavern Club, they encountered Brian Epstein, a local record-store owner and music columnist.[35] He later recalled: \"I immediately liked what I heard. They were fresh, and they were honest, and they had what I thought was a sort of presence ... [a] star quality.\"[36]\n\n\n\n#### First EMI recordings[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**The Beatles** were an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960, comprising John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr. They are regarded as the most influential band of all time[1] and were integral to the development of 1960s counterculture and the recognition of popular music as an art form.[2] Rooted in skiffle, beat, and 1950s rock 'n' roll, their sound incorporated elements of classical music and traditional pop in innovative ways. The band also explored music styles ranging from folk and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock. As pioneers in recording, songwriting, and artistic presentation, the Beatles revolutionised many aspects of the music industry and were often publicised as leaders of the era's youth and sociocultural movements.[3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOriginating as a skiffle group, the Beatles quickly embraced 1950s rock and roll and helped pioneer the Merseybeat genre,[404] and their repertoire ultimately expanded to include a broad variety of pop music.[405] Reflecting the range of styles they explored, Lennon said of *Beatles for Sale*, \"You could call our new one a Beatles country-and-western LP\",[406] while Gould credits *Rubber Soul* as \"the instrument by which legions of folk-music enthusiasts were coaxed into the camp of pop\".[407]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Beatles continued to absorb influences long after their initial success, often finding new musical and lyrical avenues by listening to their contemporaries, including Bob Dylan, Smokey Robinson and the Miracles, the Who, Frank Zappa, the Lovin' Spoonful, the Byrds and the Beach Boys, whose 1966 album *Pet Sounds* amazed and inspired McCartney.[397][398][399][400][401] Referring to the Beach Boys' creative leader, Martin later stated: \"No one made a greater impact on the Beatles than Brian [Wilson].\"[402] Ravi Shankar, with whom Harrison studied for six weeks in India in late 1966, had a significant effect on his musical development during the band's later years.[403]\n\n\n\n### Genres[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBy January 1959, Lennon's Quarry Bank friends had left the group, and he began his studies at the Liverpool College of Art.[12] The three guitarists, billing themselves as Johnny and the Moondogs,[13] were playing rock and roll whenever they could find a drummer.[14] Lennon's art school friend Stuart Sutcliffe, who had just sold one of his paintings and was persuaded to purchase a bass guitar with the proceeds, joined in January 1960. He suggested changing the band's name to *Beatals*, as a tribute to Buddy Holly and the Crickets.[15][16] They used this name until May, when they became the Silver Beetles, before undertaking a brief tour of Scotland as the backing group for pop singer and fellow Liverpudlian Johnny Gentle. By early July, they had refashioned themselves as the Silver Beatles, and by the middle of August simply *the Beatles*.[17]\n\n\n\n#### Early residencies and UK popularity[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Everett, Walter (1999). *The Beatles as Musicians: Revolver through the Anthology*.

They auditioned and hired drummer Pete Best in mid-August 1960. The band, now a five-piece, departed Liverpool for Hamburg four days later, contracted to club owner Bruno Koschmider for what would be a 3+1⁄2-month residency.[18] Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn writes: \"They pulled into Hamburg at dusk on 17 August, the time when the red-light area comes to life ... flashing neon lights screamed out the various entertainment on offer, while scantily clad women sat unabashed in shop windows waiting for business opportunities.\"[19]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLed by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, the Beatles evolved from Lennon's previous group, the Quarrymen, and built their reputation by playing clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg over three years from 1960, initially with Stuart Sutcliffe playing bass. The core trio of Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison, together since 1958, went through a succession of drummers, including Pete Best, before inviting Starr to join them in 1962. Manager Brian Epstein moulded them into a professional act, and producer George Martin guided and developed their recordings, greatly expanding their domestic success after they signed with EMI Records and achieved their first hit, \"Love Me Do\", in late 1962. As their popularity grew into the intense fan frenzy dubbed \"Beatlemania\", the band acquired the nickname \"the Fab Four\". Epstein, Martin or another member of the band's entourage was sometimes informally referred to as a \"fifth Beatle\".\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Beatles' 1964 arrival in the US is credited with initiating the album era;[430] the music historian Joel Whitburn says that LP sales soon \"exploded and eventually outpaced the sales and releases of singles\" in the music industry.[431] They not only sparked the British Invasion of the US,[432] they became a globally influential phenomenon as well.[433] From the 1920s, the US had dominated popular entertainment culture throughout much of the world, via Hollywood films, jazz, the music of Broadway and Tin Pan Alley and, later, the rock and roll that first emerged in Memphis, Tennessee.[341] The Beatles are regarded as British cultural icons, with young adults from abroad naming the band among a group of people whom they most associated with UK culture.[434][435]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Beatles' earliest influences include Elvis Presley, Carl Perkins, Little Richard, Chuck Berry and Gene Vincent.[389][390] During the Beatles' co-residency with Little Richard at the Star-Club in Hamburg, from April to May 1962, he advised them on the proper technique for performing his songs.[391] Of Presley, Lennon said, \"Nothing really affected me until I heard Elvis. If there hadn't been Elvis, there would not have been the Beatles.\"[392] Chuck Berry was particularly influential in terms of songwriting and lyrics. Lennon noted, \"He was well advanced of his time lyric-wise. We all owe a lot to him.\"[393] Other early influences include Buddy Holly, Eddie Cochran, Roy Orbison,[394] the Everly Brothers[395] and Jerry Lee Lewis.[396]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOther commentators such as Mikal Gilmore and Todd Leopold have traced the inception of their socio-cultural impact earlier, interpreting even the Beatlemania period, particularly on their first visit to the US, as a key moment in the development of generational awareness.[101][442] Referring to their appearance on *the Ed Sullivan Show* Leopold states: \"In many ways, the Sullivan appearance marked the beginning of a cultural revolution ... The Beatles were like aliens dropped into the United States of 1964.\"[442] According to Gilmore:\n\n\n\n\n> Elvis Presley had shown us how rebellion could be fashioned into eye-opening style; the Beatles were showing us how style could have the impact of cultural revelation – or at least how a pop vision might be forged into an unimpeachable consensus.[101]\n> \n> \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Beatles' first visit to the US took place when the nation was still mourning the assassination of President John F. Kennedy the previous November.[101] Commentators often suggest that for many, particularly the young, the Beatles' performances reignited the sense of excitement and possibility that momentarily faded in the wake of the assassination, and helped pave the way for the revolutionary social changes to come later in the decade.[102] Their hairstyle, unusually long for the era and mocked by many adults,[16] became an emblem of rebellion to the burgeoning youth culture.[103]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Hertsgaard, Mark (1995). \"We All Want to Change the World: Drugs, Politics, and Spirituality\". *A Day in the Life: The Music and Artistry of the Beatles*.

At a show in Atlanta, the Beatles gave one of the first live performances ever to make use of a foldback system of on-stage monitor speakers.[146] Towards the end of the tour, they met with Elvis Presley, a foundational musical influence on the band, who invited them to his home in Beverly Hills.[147][148]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\na giant step toward reshaping the concert business\".[440] Emulation of their clothing and especially their hairstyles, which became a mark of rebellion, had a global impact on fashion.[103]\n\n\nAccording to Gould, the Beatles changed the way people listened to popular music and experienced its role in their lives. From what began as the Beatlemania fad, the group's popularity grew into what was seen as an embodiment of sociocultural movements of the decade. As icons of the 1960s counterculture, Gould continues, they became a catalyst for bohemianism and activism in various social and political arenas, fuelling movements such as women's liberation, gay liberation and environmentalism.[441] According to Peter Lavezzoli, after the \"more popular than Jesus\" controversy in 1966, the Beatles felt considerable pressure to say the right things and \"began a concerted effort to spread a message of wisdom and higher consciousness\".[169]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBy early 1964, the Beatles were international stars and had achieved unprecedented levels of critical and commercial success. They became a leading force in Britain's cultural resurgence, ushering in the British Invasion of the United States pop market. They soon made their film debut with *A Hard Day's Night* (1964). A growing desire to refine their studio efforts, coupled with the challenging nature of their concert tours, led to the band's retirement from live performances in 1966. During this time, they produced records of greater sophistication, including the albums *Rubber Soul* (1965), *Revolver* (1966), and *Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band* (1967). They also enjoyed further commercial success with *The Beatles* (also known as \"the White Album\", 1968) and *Abbey Road* (1969). The success of these records heralded the album era, as albums became the dominant form of record use over singles. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n442. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Leopold, Todd (31 January 2014). \"Beatles + Sullivan = Revolution: Why Beatlemania Could Never Happen Today\".

Their initial impact would have been enough to establish the Beatles as one of their era's most influential cultural forces, but they didn't stop there. Although their initial style was a highly original, irresistibly catchy synthesis of early American rock and roll and R&B, the Beatles spent the rest of the 1960s expanding rock's stylistic frontiers, consistently staking out new musical territory on each release. The band's increasingly sophisticated experimentation encompassed a variety of genres, including folk-rock, country, psychedelia, and baroque pop, without sacrificing the effortless mass appeal of their early work.[385]\n> \n> \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe success brought increased media exposure, to which the Beatles responded with an irreverent and comical attitude that defied the expectations of pop musicians at the time, inspiring even more interest.[65] The band toured the UK three times in the first half of the year: a four-week tour that began in February, the Beatles' first nationwide, preceded three-week tours in March and May–June.[66] As their popularity spread, a frenzied adulation of the group took hold. On 13 October, the Beatles starred on *Sunday Night at the London Palladium*, the UK's top variety show.[67] Their performance was televised live and watched by 15 million viewers. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n220. **^** Knott, Jonathan (9 September 2023). \"'Used as propaganda': the Beatles' Greek island plans and international politics\". *Journal of Beatles Studies*. **2023** (Spring/Autumn): 109–141. doi:10.3828/jbs.2023.7.

These included string and brass ensembles as well as Indian instruments such as the sitar in \"Norwegian Wood\" and the swarmandal in \"Strawberry Fields Forever\".[425] They also used novel electronic instruments such as the Mellotron, with which McCartney supplied the flute voices on the \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" intro,[426] and the clavioline, an electronic keyboard that created the unusual oboe-like sound on \"Baby, You're a Rich Man\".[427]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cultural impact of the Beatles\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn August, journalist Al Aronowitz arranged for the Beatles to meet Bob Dylan.[117] Visiting the band in their New York hotel suite, Dylan introduced them to cannabis.[118] Gould points out the musical and cultural significance of this meeting, before which the musicians' respective fanbases were \"perceived as inhabiting two separate subcultural worlds\": Dylan's audience of \"college kids with artistic or intellectual leanings, a dawning political and social idealism, and a mildly bohemian style\" contrasted with their fans, \"veritable 'teenyboppers' – kids in high school or grade school whose lives were totally wrapped up in the commercialised popular culture of television, radio, pop records, fan magazines, and teen fashion. To many of Dylan's followers in the folk music scene, the Beatles were seen as idolaters, not idealists.\"[119]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn December 1962, the Beatles concluded their fifth and final Hamburg residency.[50] By 1963, they had agreed that all four band members would contribute vocals to their albums – including Starr, despite his restricted vocal range, to validate his standing in the group.[51] Lennon and McCartney had established a songwriting partnership, and as the band's success grew, their dominant collaboration limited Harrison's opportunities as a lead vocalist.[52] Epstein, to maximise the Beatles' commercial potential, encouraged them to adopt a professional approach to performing.[53] Lennon recalled him saying, \"Look, if you really want to get in these bigger places, you're going to have to change – stop eating on stage, stop swearing, stop smoking ....\"[41][nb 1]\n\n\n\n### 1963–1966: Beatlemania and touring years[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Beatlemania\n\n#### *Please Please Me* and *With the Beatles*[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![Paul McCartney, George Harrison and John Lennon of the Beatles performing on Dutch TV in 1964](image)McCartney, Harrison and Lennon performing on Dutch TV in 1964\nTouring internationally in June and July, the Beatles staged 37 shows over 27 days in Denmark, the Netherlands, Hong Kong, Australia and New Zealand.[114][nb 6] In August and September, they returned to the US, with a 30-concert tour of 23 cities.[116] Generating intense interest once again, the month-long tour attracted between 10,000 and 20,000 fans to each 30-minute performance in cities from San Francisco to New York.[116]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Pedler, Dominic (2003). *The Songwriting Secrets of The Beatles*.

During the 1990s, as Jackson lost control of his \"troubling life\", his music suffered and began to shape \"an arc not merely of promise fulfilled and outlived, but of something approaching tragedy: a phenomenally ebullient child star tops himself like none before, only to transmute audibly into a lost weirdo\".[434] In the 2000s, Christgau wrote: \"Jackson's obsession with fame, his grotesque life magnified by his grotesque wealth, are such an offense to rock aesthetes that the fact that he's a great musician is now often forgotten\".[435]\n\n\n\n## Philanthropy and humanitarian work[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Philanthropy of Michael Jackson\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n434. **^** Christgau, Robert (December 2004). \"Michael Jackson: 'The Ultimate Collection'\". *Blender*.

He insisted that the sleepovers were not sexual and that his words had been misunderstood.[268][269]\n\n\nIn October 2003, Jackson received the Key to the City of Las Vegas from Mayor Oscar Goodman.[270] On November 18, 2003, Sony released *Number Ones*, a greatest hits compilation.

His music career began there in 1954, at Sun Records with producer Sam Phillips, who wanted to bring the sound of African-American music to a wider audience. Presley, on guitar and accompanied by lead guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black, was a pioneer of rockabilly, an uptempo, backbeat-driven fusion of country music and rhythm and blues. In 1955, drummer D. J. Fontana joined to complete the lineup of Presley's classic quartet and RCA Victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker, who would manage him for more than two decades. Presley's first RCA single, \"Heartbreak Hotel\", was released in January 1956 and became a number-one hit in the United States. Within a year, RCA would sell ten million Presley singles. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![Present-day photograph of a whitewashed house, about 15 feet wide.

The family attended an Assembly of God church, where he found his initial musical inspiration.[11] Vernon moved from one odd job to the next,[12][13] and the family often relied on neighbors and government food assistance. In 1938 they lost their home after Vernon was found guilty of altering a check and jailed for eight months.[11]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe great joke was that we were taking [illegal] drugs, and look what happened to him\", a reference to Presley's early death linked to prescription drug abuse.[218]\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Junior Chamber of Commerce named Presley one of its annual Ten Most Outstanding Young Men of the Nation on January 16, 1971.[219] Not long after, the City of Memphis named the stretch of Highway 51 South on which Graceland is located \"Elvis Presley Boulevard\". The same year, Presley became the first rock and roll singer to be awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award (then known as the Bing Crosby Award).[220][221] Three new, non-film Presley studio albums were released in 1971. Best received by critics was *Elvis Country*, a concept record that focused on genre standards.[222] The biggest seller was *Elvis Sings The Wonderful World of Christmas*.

He introduced the beat to everything and he changed everything—music, language, clothes.\"[380] John Lennon said that \"Nothing really affected me until Elvis.\"[381] Bob Dylan described the sensation of first hearing Presley as \"like busting out of jail\".[368]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Elvis Presley at Curlie\n* Elvis Presley at IMDb\n* Elvis Presley at the TCM Movie Database\n* Elvis Presley at AllMovie\n* Elvis The Music official record label site\n* Elvis Presley Interviews on officially sanctioned Elvis Australia site\n* \"The All American Boy: Enter Elvis and the Rock-a-billies\" episode of 1968 *Pop Chronicles* radio series\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Although some pronounce his surname /ˈprɛzli/ *PREZ-lee*, Presley himself pronounced it /ˈprɛsli/ *PRESS-lee*, as did his family and those who worked with him.[2]The correct spelling of his middle name has long been a matter of debate.

His mother recalled that from the age of two, at the Assembly of God church in Tupelo attended by the family, \"he would slide down off my lap, run into the aisle and scramble up to the platform. There he would stand looking at the choir and trying to sing with them.\"[306] In Memphis, Presley frequently attended all-night gospel singings at the Ellis Auditorium, where groups such as the Statesmen Quartet led the music in a style that, Guralnick suggests, sowed the seeds of Presley's future stage act:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Presley's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6777 Hollywood Blvd\nFor much of his adult life, Presley, with his rise from poverty to riches and fame, had seemed to epitomize the American Dream.[382][383] In his final years, and following the revelations about his circumstances after his death, he became a symbol of excess and gluttony.[384][385] Increasing attention was paid to his appetite for the rich, heavy Southern cooking of his upbringing, foods such as chicken-fried steak and biscuits and gravy.[386][387] In particular, his love of fried peanut butter, banana, and (sometimes) bacon sandwiches,[388][386] now known as \"Elvis sandwiches\",[389] came to symbolize this characteristic.[390]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPresley's rise to national attention in 1956 transformed the field of popular music and had a huge effect on the broader scope of popular culture.[364] As the catalyst for the cultural revolution that was rock and roll, he was central not only to defining it as a musical genre but in making it a touchstone of youth culture and rebellious attitude.[365] With its racially mixed origins—repeatedly affirmed by Presley—rock and roll's occupation of a central position in mainstream American culture facilitated a new acceptance and appreciation of black culture.[366]\n\n\nIn this regard, Little Richard said of Presley, \"He was an integrator. Elvis was a blessing. They wouldn't let black music through. He opened the door for black music.\"[367] Al Green agreed: \"He broke the ice for all of us.\"[368]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Elvis Aaron Presley**[a] (January 8, 1935 – August 16, 1977), also known simply as **Elvis**, was an American singer and actor. Known as the \"King of Rock and Roll\", he is regarded as one of the most significant cultural figures of the 20th century. Presley's energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style, combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines during a transformative era in race relations, brought both great success and initial controversy.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Roy, Samuel (1985). *Elvis: Prophet of Power*.

June Juanico of Memphis, one of Presley's early girlfriends, later blamed Parker for encouraging him to choose his dating partners with publicity in mind.[206] Presley never grew comfortable with the Hollywood scene, and most of these relationships were insubstantial.[362]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Cultural impact of Elvis Presley, Cultural depictions of Elvis Presley, Elvis has left the building, and List of songs about or referencing Elvis Presley\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPresley was a central figure in the development of rockabilly, according to music historians. \"Rockabilly crystallized into a recognizable style in 1954 with Elvis Presley's first release, on the Sun label,\" writes Craig Morrison.[315] Paul Friedlander described rockabilly as \"essentially ... \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBetween 1977 and 1981, six of Presley's posthumously released singles were top-ten country hits.[277] Graceland was opened to the public in 1982.

In 1984, he received the W. C. Handy Award from the Blues Foundation and the Academy of Country Music's first Golden Hat Award. In 1987, he received the American Music Awards' Award of Merit.[287]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSince 1977, there have been numerous alleged sightings of Presley. A long-standing conspiracy theory among some fans is that he faked his death.[391][392] Adherents cite alleged discrepancies in the death certificate, reports of a wax dummy in his original coffin, and accounts of Presley planning a diversion so he could retire in peace.[393] An unusually large number of fans have domestic shrines devoted to Presley and journey to sites with which he is connected, however faintly.[394] On the anniversary of his death, thousands of people gather outside Graceland for a candlelight ritual.[395] \"With Elvis, it is not just his music that has survived death\", writes Ted Harrison. \"He himself has been raised, like a medieval saint, to a figure of cultic status. It is as if he has been canonized by acclamation.\"[394]\n\n\n\nOn the 25th anniversary of Presley's death, *The New York Times* asserted: \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn late April he began a two-week residency at the New Frontier Hotel and Casino on the Las Vegas Strip.[87] The shows were poorly received by the conservative, middle-aged hotel guests—\"like a jug of corn liquor at a champagne party\", wrote a critic for *Newsweek.*[88] Amid his Vegas tenure, Presley, who had acting ambitions, signed a seven-year contract with Paramount Pictures.[89] He began a tour of the Midwest in mid-May, covering fifteen cities in as many days.[90] He had attended several shows by Freddie Bell and the Bellboys in Vegas and was struck by their cover of \"Hound Dog\", a hit in 1953 for blues singer Big Mama Thornton by songwriters Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller. It became his new closing number.[91]\n\n\n\nAfter a show in La Crosse, Wisconsin, an urgent message on the letterhead of the local Catholic diocese's newspaper was sent to FBI director J.

It warned that \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![Elvis in a tuxedo](image)Presley in a Sun Records promotional photograph, 1954\nIn August 1953, Presley checked into Memphis Recording Service, the company run by Sam Phillips before he started Sun Records. He aimed to pay for studio time to record a two-sided acetate disc: \"My Happiness\" and \"That's When Your Heartaches Begin\". He later claimed that he intended the record as a birthday gift for his mother, or that he was merely interested in what he \"sounded like\". Biographer Peter Guralnick argued that Presley chose Sun in the hope of being discovered.[40] In January 1954, Presley cut a second acetate at Sun—\"I'll Never Stand in Your Way\" and \"It Wouldn't Be the Same Without You\"—but again nothing came of it.[41] Not long after, he failed an audition for a local vocal quartet, the Songfellows,[42] and another for the band of Eddie Bond.[43]\n\n\n\n![](image)\n\n\"That's All Right\"\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nKing recalled that he had known Presley before he was popular when they both used to frequent Beale Street.[37] By the time he graduated high school in June 1953, Presley had singled out music as his future.[38][39]\n\n\n\n### 1953–1956: first recordings[edit]\n\n\n#### Sam Phillips and Sun Records[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of songs recorded by Elvis Presley on the Sun label\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPresley went onstage with a Derringer in his right boot and a .45 caliber pistol in his waistband, but the concerts succeeded without any incidents.[211][212]\n\n\n\n*That's the Way It Is*, produced to accompany the documentary and featuring both studio and live recordings, marked a stylistic shift. As music historian John Robertson noted, \n\n\n> The authority of Presley's singing helped disguise the fact that the album stepped decisively away from the American-roots inspiration of the Memphis sessions towards a more middle-of-the-road sound. With country put on the back burner, and soul and R&B left in Memphis, what was left was very classy, very clean white pop—perfect for the Las Vegas crowd, but a definite retrograde step for Elvis.[213]\n> \n> \n\n After the end of his International engagement on September 7, Presley embarked on a week-long concert tour, largely of the South, his first since 1958. Another week-long tour, of the West Coast, followed in November.[214]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Guralnick, Peter (1994). *Last Train to Memphis: The Rise of Elvis Presley*. Little, Brown.

Humes High School, Presley received a C in music in eighth grade. When his music teacher said he had no aptitude for singing, he brought in his guitar and sang a recent hit, \"Keep Them Cold Icy Fingers Off Me\".[23] He was usually too shy to perform openly and was occasionally bullied by classmates for being a \"mama's boy\".[24] In 1950, Presley began practicing guitar under the tutelage of Lee Denson, a neighbor. They and three other boys—including two future rockabilly pioneers, brothers Dorsey and Johnny Burnette—formed a loose musical collective.[25]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Doll, Susan (2016). *Understanding Elvis: Southern Roots vs. Star Image*.

Anti-negro prejudice doubtless figured in adult antagonism. Regardless of whether parents were aware of the Negro sexual origins of the phrase 'rock 'n' roll', Presley impressed them as the visual and aural embodiment of sex.\"[6]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn December 20, Presley received his draft notice, though he was granted a deferment to finish the forthcoming film *King Creole*. A couple of weeks into the new year, \"Don't\", another Leiber and Stoller tune, became Presley's tenth number-one seller. Recording sessions for the *King Creole* soundtrack were held in Hollywood in mid-January 1958. Leiber and Stoller provided three songs, but it would be the last time Presley and the duo worked closely together.[140] As Stoller later recalled, Presley's manager and entourage sought to wall him off.[141] A brief soundtrack session on February 11 marked the final occasion on which Black was to perform with Presley.[142]\n\n\n\n### 1958–1960: military service and mother's death[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Military career of Elvis Presley\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n#### Crazed crowds and film debut[edit]\n\n\n![Elvis performing on stage](image)Presley performing live at the Mississippi-Alabama Fairgrounds in Tupelo, September 26, 1956\n![](image)\n\n\"We're gonna do a sad song ...\"\n\n\nPresley's definition of rock and roll included a sense of humor—here, during his second Sullivan appearance, he introduces one of his signature numbers.\n\n---\n\n*Problems playing this file?

His gospel album *He Touched Me*, released that month, would earn him his second Grammy Award for Best Inspirational Performance. A fourteen-date tour commenced with an unprecedented four consecutive sold-out shows at New York's Madison Square Garden.[224] The evening concert on July 10 was issued in LP form a week later. *Elvis: As Recorded at Madison Square Garden* became one of Presley's biggest-selling albums. After the tour, the single \"Burning Love\" was released—Presley's last top ten hit on the U.S. pop chart. \"The most exciting single Elvis has made since 'All Shook Up'\", wrote rock critic Robert Christgau.[225]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe persistence of such attitudes was fueled by resentment over the fact that Presley, whose musical and visual performance idiom owed much to African-American sources, achieved the cultural acknowledgement and commercial success largely denied his black peers.[347] Into the 21st century, the notion that Presley had \"stolen\" black music still found adherents.[*example needed*][349][350] Notable among African-American entertainers expressly rejecting this view was Jackie Wilson, who argued, \"A lot of people have accused Elvis of stealing the black man's music, when in fact, almost every black solo entertainer copied his stage mannerisms from Elvis.\"[351] Moreover, Presley acknowledged his debt to African-American musicians throughout his career. Addressing his '68 Comeback Special audience, he said, \"Rock 'n' roll music is basically gospel or rhythm and blues, or it sprang from that. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDuring his junior year, Presley began to stand out among his classmates, largely because of his appearance: he grew his sideburns and styled his hair. He would head down to Beale Street, the heart of Memphis' thriving blues scene, and admire the wild, flashy clothes at Lansky Brothers. By his senior year, he was wearing those clothes.[26] He competed in Humes' Annual \"Minstrel\" Show in 1953, singing and playing \"Till I Waltz Again with You\", a recent hit for Teresa Brewer. Presley recalled that the performance did much for his reputation: \n\n\n> I wasn't popular in school ... I failed music—only thing I ever failed. And then they entered me in this talent show ... when I came onstage, I heard people kind of rumbling and whispering and so forth, 'cause nobody knew I even sang. It was amazing how popular I became in school after that.[27]\n> \n> \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![Elvis being sworn into the US Army](image)Presley being sworn into the Army on March 24, 1958, at Fort Chaffee\nOn March 24, 1958, Presley was drafted into the United States Army at Fort Chaffee in Arkansas. His arrival was a major media event. Hundreds of people descended on Presley as he stepped from the bus; photographers accompanied him into the installation.[143] Presley announced that he was looking forward to his military service, saying that he did not want to be treated any differently from anyone else.[144]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBetween March 28 and September 17, 1958, Presley completed basic and advanced training at Fort Hood, Texas, where he was temporarily assigned to Company A, 2d Medium Tank Battalion, 37th Armor. During the two weeks' leave between his basic and advanced training in early June, he recorded five songs in Nashville.[145] In early August, Presley's mother was diagnosed with hepatitis, and her condition rapidly worsened. Presley was granted emergency leave to visit her and arrived in Memphis on August 12. Two days later, she died of heart failure at age 46. Presley was devastated and never the same;[146][147] their relationship had remained extremely close—even into his adulthood, they would use baby talk with each other and Presley would address her with pet names.[4]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPresley returned to the U.S. on March 2, 1960, and was honorably discharged three days later.[161] The train that carried him from New Jersey to Tennessee was mobbed all the way, and Presley was called upon to appear at scheduled stops to please his fans.[162] On the night of March 20, he entered RCA's Nashville studio to cut tracks for a new album along with a single, \"Stuck on You\", which was rushed into release and swiftly became a number-one hit.[163] Another Nashville session two weeks later yielded a pair of bestselling singles, the ballads \"It's Now or Never\" and \"Are You Lonesome Tonight?\", along with the rest of *Elvis Is Back!* The album features several songs described by Greil Marcus as full of Chicago blues \"menace, driven by Presley's own super-miked acoustic guitar, brilliant playing by Scotty Moore, and demonic sax work from Boots Randolph. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Lynch, Rene (August 16, 2011). \"Elvis Presley, Who Died 34 Years Ago Today, Spurs Fresh Tears\". *Los Angeles Times*.

That month, CBS taped two concerts for a television special, *Elvis in Concert*, to be broadcast in October. In the first, shot in Omaha on June 19, Presley's voice, Guralnick writes, \"is almost unrecognizable, a small, childlike instrument in which he talks more than sings most of the songs, casts about uncertainly for the melody in others, and is virtually unable to articulate or project\".[265] Two days later, in Rapid City, South Dakota, \"he looked healthier, seemed to have lost a little weight, and sounded better, too\", though, by the conclusion of the performance, his face was \"framed in a helmet of blue-black hair from which sweat sheets down over pale, swollen cheeks\".[265] Presley's final concert was held in Indianapolis at Market Square Arena, on June 26, 1977.[266]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\"No,\" Presley said, \"that's the real king of rock and roll.\"[201] The next day, Parker's negotiations with the hotel resulted in a five-year contract for Presley to play each February and August, at an annual salary of $1 million.[202] *Newsweek* commented, \"There are several unbelievable things about Elvis, but the most incredible is his staying power in a world where meteoric careers fade like shooting stars.\"[203] *Rolling Stone* called Presley \"supernatural, his own resurrection.\"[204] In November, Presley's final non-concert film, *Change of Habit*, opened. The double album *From Memphis to Vegas/From Vegas to Memphis* came out the same month; the first LP consisted of live performances from the International, the second of more cuts from the American Sound sessions. \"Suspicious Minds\" reached the top of the charts—Presley's first U.S. pop number-one in over seven years, and his last.[205]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_L3WhGCMlbuqrz6CiIEFd9WTN","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
