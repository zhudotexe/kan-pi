Lee appeared to be in control throughout much of the match, but AlphaGo gained the advantage in the final 20 minutes and Lee resigned.[45] Lee stated afterwards that he had made a critical error at the beginning of the match; he said that the computer's strategy in the early part of the game was \"excellent\" and that the AI had made one unusual move that no human Go player would have made.[45] David Ormerod, commenting on the game at Go Game Guru, described Lee's seventh stone as \"a strange move to test AlphaGo's strength in the opening\", characterising the move as a mistake and AlphaGo's response as \"accurate and efficient\". \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n### Game 2[edit]\n\n\nAlphaGo (black) won the second game. Lee stated afterwards that \"AlphaGo played a nearly perfect game\",[49] \"from very beginning of the game I did not feel like there was a point that I was leading\".[50] One of the creators of AlphaGo, Demis Hassabis, said that the system was confident of victory from the midway point of the game, even though the professional commentators could not tell which player was ahead.[50]\n\n\nMichael Redmond (9p) noted that AlphaGo's 19th stone (move 37) was \"creative\" and \"unique\". It was a move that no human would've ever made.[30] Lee took an unusually long time to respond to the move.[30] An Younggil (8p) called AlphaGo's move 37 \"a rare and intriguing shoulder hit\" but said Lee's counter was \"exquisite\". He stated that control passed between the players several times before the endgame, and especially praised AlphaGo's moves 151, 157, and 159, calling them \"brilliant\".[51]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLee, playing black, opened with a High Chinese formation and generated a large area of black influence, which AlphaGo invaded at move 12. This required the program to defend a weak group, which it did successfully.[54] An Younggil described Lee's move 31 as possibly the \"losing move\"[54] and Andy Jackson of the American Go Association considered that the outcome had already been decided by move 35.[53] AlphaGo had gained control of the game by move 48, and forced Lee onto the defensive. Lee counterattacked at moves 77/79, but AlphaGo's response was effective and its move 90 succeeded in simplifying the position. It then gained a large area of control at the bottom of the board, strengthening its position with moves from 102 to 112 described by An as \"sophisticated\".[54] Lee attacked again at moves 115 and 125, but AlphaGo's responses were again effective. Lee eventually attempted a complex *ko* from move 131, without forcing an error from the program, and he resigned at move 176.[54]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n36. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Zastrow, Mark. \"'I'm in shock!'

Retrieved 30 December 2016.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGo is a popular game in South Korea, China and Japan, and this match was watched and analyzed by millions of people worldwide.[68] Many top Go players characterized AlphaGo's unorthodox plays as seemingly-questionable moves that initially befuddled onlookers, but made sense in hindsight:[72] \"All but the very best Go players craft their style by imitating top players. AlphaGo seems to have totally original moves it creates itself.\"[68] AlphaGo appeared to have unexpectedly become much stronger, even when compared with its October 2015 match against Fan Hui[80] where a computer had beaten a Go professional for the first time ever without the advantage of a handicap.[81]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe first 11 moves were identical to the second game, where Lee also played white. In the early game, Lee concentrated on taking territory in the edges and corners of the board, allowing AlphaGo to gain influence in the top and centre. Lee then invaded AlphaGo's region of influence at the top with moves 40 to 48, following the *amashi* strategy. AlphaGo responded with a shoulder hit at move 47, subsequently sacrificing four stones elsewhere, and gaining the initiative with moves 47 to 53 and 69. Lee tested AlphaGo with moves 72 to 76 without provoking an error, and by this point in the game commentators had begun to feel Lee's play was a lost cause. However, an unexpected play at white 78, described as \"a brilliant *tesuji*\", turned the game around.[57] The move developed a white wedge at the centre, and increased the game's complexity.[58] Gu Li (9p) described it as a \"divine move\" and stated that the move had been completely unforeseen by him.[57]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Moves 100–176 (122 at 113,154 at ![](image), 163 at 145, 164 at 151, 166 and 171 at 160, 169 at 145, 175 at ![](image))\n |\n\n\n### Game 4[edit]\n\n\nLee (white) won the fourth game. Lee chose to play a type of extreme strategy, known as *amashi*, in response to AlphaGo's apparent preference for *Souba Go* (attempting to win by many small gains when the opportunity arises), taking territory at the perimeter rather than the center.[57] By doing so, his apparent aim was to force an \"all or nothing\" style of situation – a possible weakness for an opponent strong at negotiation types of play, and one which might make AlphaGo's capability of deciding slim advantages largely irrelevant.[57]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Moves 100–180 (177 at ![](image), 178 at ![](image))\n |\n\n\n### Game 5[edit]\n\n\nAlphaGo (white) won the fifth game.[63] The game was described as being close. Hassabis stated that the result came after the program made a \"bad mistake\" early in the game.[63]\n\n\nLee, playing black, opened in a similar fashion to the first game and then began to stake out territory in the right and top left corners – a similar strategy to the one he employed successfully in game 4 – while AlphaGo gained influence in the centre of the board. The game remained even until white moves 48 to 58, which AlphaGo played in the bottom right. These moves unnecessarily lost ko threats and aji, allowing Lee to take the lead.[64] Michael Redmond (9p) speculated that perhaps AlphaGo had missed black's \"tombstone squeeze\" *tesuji*. Humans are taught to recognize the specific pattern, but it is a long sequence of moves if it has to be computed from scratch.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n22. **^** \"Zen computer Go program beats Takemiya Masaki with just 4 stones!\".

Kasparov's loss to Deep Blue is considered the moment a computer became better than humans at chess.[17]\n\n\nAlphaGo is significantly different from previous AI efforts. Instead of using probability algorithms hard-coded by human programmers, AlphaGo uses neural networks to estimate its probability of winning. AlphaGo accesses and analyses the entire online library of Go; including all matches, players, analytics, and literature; as well as games played by AlphaGo against itself and other players. Once setup, AlphaGo is independent of the developer team and evaluates the best pathway to solving Go (i.e. winning the game). By using neural networks and Monte Carlo tree search, AlphaGo calculates colossal numbers of likely and unlikely probabilities many moves into the future [*citation needed*].\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAlphaGo then started to develop the top of the board as well as the centre, and defended successfully against an attack by Lee in moves 69 to 81 that David Ormerod characterised as over-cautious. By white 90, AlphaGo had regained equality, and then played a series of moves described by Ormerod as \"unusual... but subtly impressive\" which gained a small advantage. Lee tried a Hail Mary pass with moves 167 and 169 but AlphaGo's defence was successful. An Younggil noted white moves 154, 186 and 194 as being particularly strong, and the program played an impeccable endgame, maintaining its lead until Lee resigned.[64]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n### Game 3[edit]\n\n\nAlphaGo (white) won the third game.[55]\n\n\n\nAfter the second game, there had still been strong doubts among players whether AlphaGo was truly a strong player in the sense that a human might be. The third game was described as removing that doubt; with analysts commenting that: \n\n\n> AlphaGo won so convincingly as to remove all doubt about its strength from the minds of experienced players. In fact, it played so well that it was almost scary ... In forcing AlphaGo to withstand a very severe, one-sided attack, Lee revealed its hitherto undetected power ... Lee wasn’t gaining enough profit from his attack ... One of the greatest virtuosos of the middle game had just been upstaged in black and white clarity.[54] \n> \n> \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAlphaGo showed anomalies and moves from a broader perspective which professional Go players described as looking like mistakes at the first sight but an intentional strategy in hindsight.[52] As one of the creators of the system explained, AlphaGo does not attempt to maximize its points or its margin of victory, but tries to maximize its probability of winning.[30][53] If AlphaGo must choose between a scenario where it will win by 20 points with 80 percent probability and another where it will win by 1 and a half points with 99 percent probability, it will choose the latter, even if it must give up points to achieve it.[30] In particular, move 167 by AlphaGo seemed to give Lee a fighting chance and was declared to look like an obvious mistake by commentators. An Younggil stated \"So when AlphaGo plays a slack looking move, we may regard it as a mistake, but perhaps it should more accurately be viewed as a declaration of victory?\"[54]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n> Although we have programmed this machine to play, we have no idea what moves it will come up with. Its moves are an emergent phenomenon from the training. We just create the data sets and the training algorithms. But the moves it then comes up with are out of our hands—and much better than we, as Go players, could come up with.\n> \n> \n\n\nIn the match against Lee, AlphaGo used about the same computing power as it had in the match against Fan Hui,[31] where it used 1,202 CPUs and 176 GPUs.[13] The Economist reported that it used 1,920 CPUs and 280 GPUs.[32] Google has also stated that its proprietary tensor processing units were used in the match against Lee Sedol.[33]\n\n\n\n### Lee Sedol[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Lee Sedol\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n81. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Gibney, Elizabeth (2016). \"Go players react to computer defeat\". *Nature*. doi:10.1038/nature.2016.19255.

Lee followed up with a strong move at white 82.[57] AlphaGo's initial response in moves 83 to 85 was appropriate, but at move 87, its estimate of its chances to win suddenly plummeted,[59][*non-primary source needed*][60][*non-primary source needed*] provoking it to make a series of very bad moves from black 87 to 101. David Ormerod characterised moves 87 to 101 as typical of Monte Carlo-based program mistakes.[57] Lee took the lead by white 92, and An Younggil described black 105 as the final losing move. Despite good tactics during moves 131 to 141, AlphaGo proved unable to recover during the endgame and resigned.[57] AlphaGo's resignation was triggered when it evaluated its chance of winning to be less than 20%; this is intended to match the decision of professionals who resign rather than play to the end when their position is felt to be irrecoverable.[58]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n63. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Byford, Sam (15 March 2016). \"Google's AlphaGo AI beats Lee Se-dol again to win Go series 4-1\". *The Verge*.

Many in the field of artificial intelligence consider Go to require more elements that mimic human thought than chess.[11] Mathematician I. J. Good wrote in 1965:[12]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)AlphaGo logo\nAlphaGo is a computer program developed by Google DeepMind to play the board game Go. AlphaGo's algorithm uses a combination of machine learning and tree search techniques, combined with extensive training, both from human and computer play. The system's neural networks were initially bootstrapped from human game-play expertise. AlphaGo was initially trained to mimic human play by attempting to match the moves of expert players from recorded historical games, using a KGS Go Server database of around 30 million moves from 160,000 games by KGS 6 to 9 dan human players.[13][28] Once it had reached a certain degree of proficiency, it was trained further by being set to play large numbers of games against other instances of itself, using reinforcement learning to improve its play.[29] The system does not use a \"database\" of moves to play.
