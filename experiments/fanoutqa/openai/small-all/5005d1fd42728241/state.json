He worked at a Chicken Express as a teenager.[20]\n\n\nAt age 17, Malone released a parody synth-pop ballad song called \"Why Don't You Love Me\" under the alias Leon DeChino, intended for a school project. The song reappeared online in 2016. Malone later referenced the DeChino alias on his song \"Psycho\".[28][29]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n32. **^** \"'Post Malone' exposed part of minecraft (Before He Was Famous)\".

His father had been a DJ in his youth and introduced Malone to many different genres of music including hip hop, country, and rock.[16] When Malone was nine years old,[17] he and his family moved to Grapevine, Texas, after his father became the manager of concessions for the football team Dallas Cowboys.[18][19] Malone began to play the guitar and auditioned for the American band Crown the Empire in 2010, but was rejected after his guitar strings broke during the audition.

His father abandoned his family when he was a year and a half old, and Marshall was raised only by his mother, Debbie, in poverty.[10] His mother later had a son named Nathan \"Nate\" Kane Samara.[17] At age twelve, he and his mother had moved several times and lived in several towns and cities in Missouri (including St. Joseph, Savannah, and Kansas City) before settling in Warren, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit.[18] Eminem frequently fought with his mother, whom a social worker described as having a \"very suspicious, almost paranoid personality\".[19] He wrote letters to his father, but Debbie said that they all came back marked \"return to sender\".[20]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Marshall Bruce Mathers III** (born October 17, 1972), known professionally as **Eminem** (/\u02cc\u025bm\u026a\u02c8n\u025bm/; often stylized as **EMIN\u018eM**), is an American rapper. He is credited with popularizing hip hop in Middle America and is frequently mentioned among the greatest rappers of all time.[3] Eminem's global success and acclaimed works are widely regarded as having broken racial barriers for the acceptance of white rappers in popular music. While much of his transgressive work during the late 1990s and early 2000s made him a controversial figure, he came to be a representation of popular angst of the American underclass and has been cited as an influence by and upon many artists working in various genres.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAt age 14, Eminem began rapping with high-school friend Mike Ruby; they adopted the names \"Manix\" and \"M&M\", the latter evolving into \"Eminem\".[23][16] Eminem sneaked into neighboring Osborn High School with friend and fellow rapper Proof for lunchroom freestyle rap battles.[24] On Saturdays, they attended open mic contests at the Hip-Hop Shop on West 7 Mile Road, considered \"ground zero\" for the Detroit rap scene.[20] Struggling to succeed in a predominantly black industry, Eminem was appreciated by underground hip hop audiences.[23][25][26] When he wrote verses, he wanted most of the words to rhyme; he wrote long words or phrases on paper and, underneath, worked on rhymes for each syllable. Although the words often made little sense, the drill helped Eminem practice sounds and rhymes.[27]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n8. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"RIAA Names Eminem First Artist To Earn Two Digital Diamond Awards\". *RIAA*.

Debbie filed a lawsuit against the public school for this in 1982. The suit was dismissed the following year by a Macomb County, Michigan judge, who said the schools were immune from lawsuits.[16] For much of his youth, Eminem and his mother lived in a working-class, primarily black, Detroit neighborhood. He and Debbie were one of three white households on their block, and Eminem was beaten several times by black youths.[20]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1987, Debbie allowed runaway Kimberly Anne \"Kim\" Scott to stay at their home. Several years later, Eminem began an on-and-off relationship with Scott.[16] After spending three years in ninth grade due to truancy and poor grades,[28] he dropped out of Lincoln High School at age 17. Although interested in English, Eminem never explored literature (preferring comic books) and he disliked math and social studies.[27] Eminem worked at several jobs to help his mother pay the bills. One of the jobs he had was with Little Caesar's Pizza in Warren, Michigan.[29] He later said she often threw him out of the house anyway, often after taking most of his paycheck. When she left to play bingo, he would blast the stereo and write songs.[20]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### 1988\u20131997: Early career, *Infinite* and family struggles[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAfter he was fired from his job and evicted from his home, Eminem went to Los Angeles to compete in the 1997 Rap Olympics, an annual, nationwide battle rap competition. He placed second and an Interscope Records intern in attendance called Dean Geistlinger asked Eminem for a copy of the *Slim Shady EP*, which was then sent to company CEO Jimmy Iovine.[38] Iovine played the tape for record producer Dr. Dre, founder of Aftermath Entertainment and founding member of hip hop group N.W.A. Dre recalled, \"In my entire career in the music industry, I have never found anything from a demo tape or a CD. When Jimmy played this, I said, 'Find him.

The character allowed him to express his anger with lyrics about drugs, rape and murder.[16] In the spring of 1997 he recorded his debut EP, the *Slim Shady EP*, which was released that winter by Web Entertainment.[20] The EP, with frequent references to drug use, sexual acts, mental instability and violence, also explored the more-serious themes of dealing with poverty and marital and family difficulties and revealed his direct, self-deprecating response to criticism.[23] Hip hop magazine *The Source* featured Eminem in its \"Unsigned Hype\" column in March 1998.[37]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Eminem performing in 2018\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn June 3, 2000, Eminem was arrested during an altercation with Douglas Dail at a car-audio store in Royal Oak, Michigan, when he pulled out an unloaded gun and pointed it at the ground. The next day, in Warren, Michigan, he was arrested again for assaulting John Guerra in the parking lot of the Hot Rock Caf\u00e9 when he saw him kissing his wife.[397][398] Eminem recreated the Guerra assault in \"The Kiss (Skit)\" on *The Eminem Show*. He pleaded guilty to possession of a concealed weapon and assault, receiving two years' probation; however, Guerra's assault charge was dropped as part of the plea agreement.[399] On June 28, 2001, Eminem was sentenced to one year's probation and community service and was fined about $2,000 on weapon charges stemming from an argument with an employee of Psychopathic Records.[400]\n\n\nIn 1999, Eminem's mother sued him for $10\u00a0million, claiming he was slandering her on *The Slim Shady LP*. Litigation concluded in 2001, resulting in an award of $1,600 for her damages.[401]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nEminem promoted the station in a 2004 mock national convention (the \"Shady National Convention\") at the Roseland Ballroom in New York City,[289] in which Donald Trump endorsed him.[290] On his album *Revival* (2017), Eminem expressed his regret at having collaborated with Trump, rapping, \"wish I would have spit on it before I went to shake his hand at the event\".[291]\n\n\n\n### Mom's Spaghetti Restaurant[edit]\n\n\nOn September 29, 2021, Eminem and Union Joints opened a spaghetti restaurant at 2131 Woodward Ave in Detroit. It is a reference to the lyrics \"His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy / There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti\" from the song \"Lose Yourself\" which became an internet meme.[292][293] Mom's Spaghetti was previously a pop-up in Detroit in 2017 and at Coachella in 2018.[294][295]\n\n\nIn 2023, Eminem announced the launch of a \"Mom's Spaghetti\" jarred pasta sauce.[296]\n\n\n\n### Acting career[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n311. **^** \"Eminem's Chrysler Commercial Hailed as One of Top Super Bowl Ads of 2011\". *TheCelebrityCafe.com*.

Productions and recorded his debut album *Infinite* for their independent Web Entertainment label.[33] The album was a commercial failure upon its release in 1996.[34] One lyrical subject of *Infinite* was his struggle to raise his newborn daughter, Hailie Jade Scott Mathers, on little money. During this period, Eminem's rhyming style, primarily inspired by rappers Nas, Esham and AZ, lacked the comically violent slant for which he later became known.[35] Detroit disc jockeys largely ignored *Infinite* and the feedback Eminem did receive (\"Why don't you go into rock and roll?\") led him to craft angrier, moodier tracks.[20] At this time Eminem and Kim Scott lived in a crime-ridden neighborhood and their house was robbed several times.[20] Eminem cooked and washed dishes for minimum wage at Gilbert's Lodge, a family-style restaurant at St. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n324. **^** \"Eminem & Wife Reunion Denied\". *National Ledger*.

Eminem woke up with Hughes standing behind him and he said that he was there to kill him.[329][330][331] In a plea agreement in 2021, Hughes pleaded guilty to second-degree home invasion in exchange for dismissal of other charges; he was sentenced to probation and time served (524 days in the county jail).[331] In 2019, Hughes had pleaded guilty to breaking into a Rochester Hills home in search of Eminem.[331][332]\n\n\nOn August 23, 2023, it was revealed that the perpetrator of the 2023 Jacksonville shooting Ryan Palmeter targeted Eminem and Machine Gun Kelly as his victims in a racially-motivated attack.

He said it was a representation of growing up in Detroit rather than an account of his life. He recorded several new songs for the soundtrack, including \"Lose Yourself\" (which won an Academy Award for Best Original Song in 2003 and became the longest-running No. 1 hip hop single in history).[297] Eminem was absent from the ceremony and co-composer Luis Resto accepted the award.[298]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Eminem performing at the Concert for Valor in Washington, D.C. in 2014\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAmong Eminem's awards is 15 Grammy Awards,[152] eight American Music Awards and 17 *Billboard* Music Awards, *Billboard* named him the \"Artist of the Decade (2000\u20132009)\".[458] In 2013, he received the Global Icon Award at that year's MTV Europe Music Awards ceremony.[459] His success in *8 Mile* saw him win the 2002 Academy Award for Best Original Song for his song \"Lose Yourself\", co-written with Jeff Bass and Luis Resto, making him the first rapper to receive the award.[460] He also won the MTV Movie & TV Awards for Best Actor in a Movie and Best Breakthrough Performance[461] and the Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Song for \"Lose Yourself\".[462]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n423. **^** Mancini, Robert (September 13, 2000). \"Eminem Targeted At Senate Hearing\". *MTV News*.
