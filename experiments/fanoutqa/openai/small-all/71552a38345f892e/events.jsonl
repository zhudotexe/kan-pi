With some exceptions,[1] a three-nucleotide codon in a nucleic acid sequence specifies a single amino acid. The vast majority of genes are encoded with a single scheme (see the RNA codon table). That scheme is often referred to as the canonical or standard genetic code, or simply *the* genetic code, though variant codes (such as in mitochondria) exist.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The genetic codeFurther information: Adaptor hypothesis\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMarshall Nirenberg and Heinrich J. Matthaei were the first to reveal the nature of a codon in 1961.[12] They used a cell-free system to translate a poly-uracil RNA sequence (i.e., UUUUU...) and discovered that the polypeptide that they had synthesized consisted of only the amino acid phenylalanine.[13] They thereby deduced that the codon UUU specified the amino acid phenylalanine.\n\n\nThis was followed by experiments in Severo Ochoa's laboratory that demonstrated that the poly-adenine RNA sequence (AAAAA...) coded for the polypeptide poly-lysine[14] and that the poly-cytosine RNA sequence (CCCCC...) coded for the polypeptide poly-proline.[15] Therefore, the codon AAA specified the amino acid lysine, and the codon CCC specified the amino acid proline. Using various copolymers most of the remaining codons were then determined.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn some proteins, non-standard amino acids are substituted for standard stop codons, depending on associated signal sequences in the messenger RNA. For example, UGA can code for selenocysteine and UAG can code for pyrrolysine. Selenocysteine came to be seen as the 21st amino acid, and pyrrolysine as the 22nd.[55] Unlike selenocysteine, pyrrolysine-encoded UAG is translated with the participation of a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase.[56] Both selenocysteine and pyrrolysine may be present in the same organism.[55] Although the genetic code is normally fixed in an organism, the achaeal prokaryote *Acetohalobium arabaticum* can expand its genetic code from 20 to 21 amino acids (by including pyrrolysine) under different conditions of growth.[57]\n\n\n\n### Variations[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of genetic codes\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSince 2001, 40 non-natural amino acids have been added into proteins by creating a unique codon (recoding) and a corresponding transfer-RNA:aminoacyl – tRNA-synthetase pair to encode it with diverse physicochemical and biological properties in order to be used as a tool to exploring protein structure and function or to create novel or enhanced proteins.[22][23]\n\n\nH. Murakami and M. Sisido extended some codons to have four and five bases. Steven A. Benner constructed a functional 65th (*in vivo*) codon.[24]\n\n\nIn 2015 N. Budisa, D. Söll and co-workers reported the full substitution of all 20,899 tryptophan residues (UGG codons) with unnatural thienopyrrole-alanine in the genetic code of the bacterium *Escherichia coli*.[25]\n\n\nIn 2016 the first stable semisynthetic organism was created. It was a (single cell) bacterium with two synthetic bases (called X and Y). The bases survived cell division.[26][27]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n91. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Yarus M, Widmann JJ, Knight R (November 2009). \"RNA-amino acid binding: a stereochemical era for the genetic code\". *Journal of Molecular Evolution*. **69** (5): 406–29.

This could be an evolutionary relic of an early, simpler genetic code with fewer amino acids that later evolved to code a larger set of amino acids.[84] It could also reflect steric and chemical properties that had another effect on the codon during its evolution. Amino acids with similar physical properties also tend to have similar codons,[85][86] reducing the problems caused by point mutations and mistranslations.[83]\n\n\nGiven the non-random genetic triplet coding scheme, a tenable hypothesis for the origin of genetic code could address multiple aspects of the codon table, such as absence of codons for D-amino acids, secondary codon patterns for some amino acids, confinement of synonymous positions to third position, the small set of only 20 amino acids (instead of a number approaching 64), and the relation of stop codon patterns to amino acid coding patterns.[87]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n87. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** Erives A (August 2011). \"A model of proto-anti-codon RNA enzymes requiring L-amino acid homochirality\". *Journal of Molecular Evolution*. **73** (1–2): 10–22.

NCN yields amino acid residues that are small in size and moderate in hydropathicity; NAN encodes average size hydrophilic residues. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n14. **^** Gardner RS, Wahba AJ, Basilio C, Miller RS, Lengyel P, Speyer JF (December 1962). \"Synthetic polynucleotides and the amino acid code.

Each codon consists of three nucleotides, usually corresponding to a single amino acid. The nucleotides are abbreviated with the letters A, U, G and C. This is mRNA, which uses U (uracil). DNA uses T (thymine) instead. This mRNA molecule will instruct a ribosome to synthesize a protein according to this code.\nThe **genetic code** is the set of rules used by living cells to translate information encoded within genetic material (DNA or RNA sequences of nucleotide triplets, or codons) into proteins. Translation is accomplished by the ribosome, which links proteinogenic amino acids in an order specified by messenger RNA (mRNA), using transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules to carry amino acids and to read the mRNA three nucleotides at a time. The genetic code is highly similar among all organisms and can be expressed in a simple table with 64 entries.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n98. **^** Ronneberg TA, Landweber LF, Freeland SJ (December 2000). \"Testing a biosynthetic theory of the genetic code: fact or artifact?\". *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America*. **97** (25): 13690–5.

The start codon alone is not sufficient to begin the process. Nearby sequences such as the Shine-Dalgarno sequence in *E. coli* and initiation factors are also required to start translation. The most common start codon is AUG, which is read as methionine or as formylmethionine (in bacteria, mitochondria, and plastids). Alternative start codons depending on the organism include \"GUG\" or \"UUG\"; these codons normally represent valine and leucine, respectively, but as start codons they are translated as methionine or formylmethionine.[33]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nEfforts to understand how proteins are encoded began after DNA's structure was discovered in 1953. The key discoverers, English biophysicist Francis Crick and American biologist James Watson, working together at the Cavendish Laboratory of the University of Cambridge, hypothesied that information flows from DNA and that there is a link between DNA and proteins.[2] Soviet-American physicist George Gamow was the first to give a workable scheme for protein synthesis from DNA.[3] He postulated that sets of three bases (triplets) must be employed to encode the 20 standard amino acids used by living cells to build proteins, which would allow a maximum of 43 = 64 amino acids.[4] He named this DNA–protein interaction (the original genetic code) as the \"diamond code\".[5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe three stop codons were named by discoverers Richard Epstein and Charles Steinberg. \"Amber\" was named after their friend Harris Bernstein, whose last name means \"amber\" in German.[19] The other two stop codons were named \"ochre\" and \"opal\" in order to keep the \"color names\" theme.\n\n\n\n### Expanded genetic codes (synthetic biology)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Expanded genetic code\n\nSee also: Nucleic acid analogues\n\nIn a broad academic audience, the concept of the evolution of the genetic code from the original and ambiguous genetic code to a well-defined (\"frozen\") code with the repertoire of 20 (+2) canonical amino acids is widely accepted.[20]\nHowever, there are different opinions, concepts, approaches and ideas, which is the best way to change it experimentally. Even models are proposed that predict \"entry points\" for synthetic amino acid invasion of the genetic code.[21]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n68. **^** Schueren F, Lingner T, George R, Hofhuis J, Gartner J, Thoms S (2014). \"Peroxisomal lactate dehydrogenase is generated by translational readthrough in mammals\". *eLife*. **3**: e03640. doi:10.7554/eLife.03640.

PMID 27501944.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nVariant genetic codes used by an organism can be inferred by identifying highly conserved genes encoded in that genome, and comparing its codon usage to the amino acids in homologous proteins of other organisms. For example, the program FACIL infers a genetic code by searching which amino acids in homologous protein domains are most often aligned to every codon. The resulting amino acid (or stop codon) probabilities for each codon are displayed in a genetic code logo.[58]\n\n\nAs of January 2022, the most complete survey of genetic codes is done by Shulgina and Eddy, who screened 250,000 prokaryotic genomes using their Codetta tool. This tool uses a similar approach to FACIL with a larger Pfam database. Despite the NCBI already providing 33 translation tables, the authors were able to find new 5 genetic code variations (corroborated by tRNA mutations) and correct several misattributions.[79]\n\n\n\n## Origin[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Natural selection has led to codon assignments of the genetic code that minimize the effects of mutations.[103] A recent hypothesis[104] suggests that the triplet code was derived from codes that used longer than triplet codons (such as quadruplet codons). Longer than triplet decoding would increase codon redundancy and would be more error resistant. This feature could allow accurate decoding absent complex translational machinery such as the ribosome, such as before cells began making ribosomes.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSurprisingly, variations in the interpretation of the genetic code exist also in human nuclear-encoded genes: In 2016, researchers studying the translation of malate dehydrogenase found that in about 4% of the mRNAs encoding this enzyme the stop codon is naturally used to encode the amino acids tryptophan and arginine.[67] This type of recoding is induced by a high-readthrough stop codon context[68] and it is referred to as *functional translational readthrough*.[69]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe genetic code is so well-structured for hydropathicity that a mathematical analysis (Singular Value Decomposition) of 12 variables (4 nucleotides x 3 positions) yields a remarkable correlation (C = 0.95) for predicting the hydropathicity of the encoded amino acid directly from the triplet nucleotide sequence, *without translation.*[50][51] Note in the table, below, eight amino acids are not affected at all by mutations at the third position of the codon, whereas in the figure above, a mutation at the second position is likely to cause a radical change in the physicochemical properties of the encoded amino acid.\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_g5ALW47wiWQwI60Ehp4THFOz","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
