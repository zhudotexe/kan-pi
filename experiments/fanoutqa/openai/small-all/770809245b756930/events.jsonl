The most recent to join the list were Leicester City (2015–16 champions) and before that, Nottingham Forest (1977–78) and Derby County (1971–72).\n\n\nFive teams have won the league title three seasons in a row: Huddersfield Town (1924–1926), Arsenal (1933–1935), Liverpool (1982–1984), Manchester United twice (1999–2001 & 2007–2009) and Manchester City (2021–2023).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSeven teams have at some point held first or joint first place in the number of titles won: Preston North End (1889–1895), Sunderland (1893–1899 and 1936–1953), Aston Villa (1897–1953), Arsenal (1948–1976), Liverpool (1966–1971 and 1973–2011), Manchester United (1967–1971 and 2009–) and Everton (1970–1971).\n\n\nEight teams have finished as runners up without ever finishing top: Bristol City (1906–07), Oldham Athletic (1914–15), Cardiff City (1923–24), Charlton Athletic (1936–37), Blackpool (1955–56), Queens Park Rangers (1975–76), Watford (1982–83) and Southampton (1983–84). Of these, Cardiff City came closest to winning the league, matching champions Huddersfield Town in points but losing out on goal average (goals scored divided by goals conceded), the precursor to goal difference.\n\n\nTeams in **bold** compete in the Premier League as of the 2023–24 season.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nManchester United have won twenty titles,[11] the most of any club.[12] United's rivals Liverpool are second with nineteen. Liverpool dominated during the 1970s and 1980s (winning eleven league titles between 1973 and 1990), while Manchester United dominated in the 1990s and 2000s under manager Sir Alex Ferguson (eleven league titles between 1993\nand 2009). Arsenal are third with thirteen titles, having dominated during the 1930s (five league titles between 1931 and 1938). Everton and Manchester City are joint-fourth with nine titles, of which seven of City's have been won in the 2010s and 2020s. Aston Villa (seven) and Sunderland (six) secured the majority of their titles before the 1920s. Chelsea (six) won the majority of their titles in the 21st century (between 2005 and 2017).\n\n\nHuddersfield Town, Arsenal, Liverpool, Manchester United and Manchester City are the only sides to have won the league title in three consecutive seasons; no team has been crowned champion four seasons in a row.[13]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Rank\n | Club\n | Winners\n | Runners-up | Winning seasons\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | **Manchester United** | 20\n | 17\n | 1907–08, 1910–11, 1951–52, 1955–56, 1956–57, 1964–65, 1966–67, 1992–93, 1993–94, 1995–96, 1996–97, 1998–99, 1999–2000, 2000–01, 2002–03, 2006–07, 2007–08, 2008–09, 2010–11, 2012–13 |\n| 2\n | **Liverpool** | 19\n | 15\n | 1900–01, 1905–06, 1921–22, 1922–23, 1946–47, 1963–64, 1965–66, 1972–73, 1975–76, 1976–77, 1978–79, 1979–80, 1981–82, 1982–83, 1983–84, 1985–86, 1987–88, 1989–90, 2019–20 |\n| 3\n | **Arsenal** | 13\n | 10\n | 1930–31, 1932–33, 1933–34, 1934–35, 1937–38, 1947–48, 1952–53, 1970–71, 1988–89, 1990–91, 1997–98, 2001–02, 2003–04 |\n| 4\n | **Everton** | 9\n | 7\n | 1890–91, 1914–15, 1927–28, 1931–32, 1938–39, 1962–63, 1969–70, 1984–85, 1986–87 |\n| **Manchester City** | 6\n | 1936–37, 1967–68, 2011–12, 2013–14, 2017–18, 2018–19, 2020–21, 2021–22, 2022–23 |\n| 5\n | **Aston Villa** | 7\n | 10\n | 1893–94, 1895–96, 1896–97, 1898–99, 1899–1900, 1909–10, 1980–81 |\n| 6\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThis article is about men's English football league champions.

This resulted in a shift of power towards bigger clubs.[7] Financial considerations became an even bigger influence from 1992, when the teams then in the First Division defected to form the FA Premier League. This supplanted the Football League First Division as the highest level of football in England,[8] and due to a series of progressively larger television contracts, put unprecedented wealth into the hands of top flight clubs.[9] The first five champions in the Premier League era – Arsenal, Blackburn Rovers, Chelsea, Manchester City and Manchester United – had all won the title at least once prior to 1992. Leicester City were champions for the first time in 2016, becoming the first team to win the Premier League without having previously won the First Division. Other than inaugural league champions Preston North End, Ipswich Town remain the only club to win the top flight division at their first ever attempt.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n### Premier

It was not until 1931 that a Southern club were crowned champions, when Herbert Chapman's Arsenal secured the title.[6]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 1964–65 | Manchester United (6)\n | Leeds United

The club's first captain was Nick Ross, who captained Everton during the 1888-89 season. The longest-serving captain is Peter Farrell, who was club captain for 9 years – from 1948 to 1957. Despite his long tenure, Peter Farrell never won a trophy at Everton. Kevin Ratcliffe, who captained Everton during their most successful period in history, is Everton's most decorated captain. He won 7 trophies as captain, including 2 First Division titles, 4 Charity Shields, and 1 Cup Winners' Cup. Everton's current captain is Séamus Coleman.

It also records notable achievements by Arsenal players on the international stage, and the highest transfer fees paid and received by the club.

Between the 1998–99 and 2016–17 seasons, they participated in nineteen successive editions, a record only surpassed in Europe by Real Madrid.[164] Goalkeeper Jens Lehmann kept ten consecutive clean sheets in the run-in to Arsenal's first UEFA Champions League final and the defence went 995 minutes until conceding a goal.[165] Arsenal were also the first British side to defeat Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund away from home, and both Milanese teams: Internazionale and Milan at the San Siro.

The second table groups together the club's most recent players, providing a more detailed breakdown of their \"appearances\" and \"goals\" statistics (and with the current players highlighted in blue for easy reference).\n\n\n\n### Historic players[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Gary James, *Manchester City – The Complete Record*, p. 283.\n2. **^** Gary James, *Manchester City – The Complete Record*, p. 291.\n3. **^** Gary James, *Manchester City – The Complete Record*, p. 319.\n4. **^** Gary James, *Manchester City – The Complete Record*, p. 327.\n5. **^** Gary James, *Manchester City – The Complete Record*, p. 329.\n6. **^** \nScott, James (9 August 2013). \"City's top 50: No. 6\". *Manchester Evening News*.

The list is initially presented in the chronological order of the dates each player made his debut for England at full international level but can be sorted based on the contents of the fourth column to display the players in order of most appearances for their country. The list includes all ten of the most capped players who played for England while also actively playing for the club (just sort the list instead based on the contents of the third column). Players who won all of their England caps playing for Manchester City are indicated in **bold** font. Internationals with no caps won while playing at Manchester City are indicated in *italics*. Players who are currently internationally active players are highlighted in blue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Some well-respected statistics sources include in players' total goals tallies goals scored in the three rounds of league games played by Manchester City at the start of the 1939–40 season, before war was declared on 3 September and the football league was officially abandoned. Peter Doherty played in all of those matches and scored a goal in each of the first two games, and when these two goals are included in his official goals tally it is two goals larger than it should be. Because those matches have long been expunged from official league records and those goals should similarly not be included in his official total goals tally. When these war time fixtures are properly accounted for Doherty's total goals for Manchester City become 80 (not 82).\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Sources differ over the scorer of an FA Cup goal against Blackpool in 1966. James and the *MCFCstats* website credit it to Johnny Crossan, Baskcomb credits it to Glyn Pardoe. The figures in this table assign the goal to Crossan.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nErling Haaland holds the club and Premier League records for league goals, and club record for total goals in a single season, with 36 league goals, 52 overall in 2022–23. This single season tally also means Haaland additionally currently holds the record for most goals scored per game played in a season, his 52 goals in 53 appearances yielding a goal scoring rate of 0.97 goals per game. Haaland is also the first City player to win five prestigious individual football awards in a season and the first to win the UEFA Men's Player of the Year Award.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Sourcing, currency and key for the statistics[edit]\n\n\n![Two young men dressed in sportswear hold a large trophy aloft.

Frank Swift, Eric Brook, Alec Herd and Peter Doherty all played in each of those matches, and when these three fixtures are included in their official appearances tallies they are three games larger than they should be. Because those matches have long been expunged from official league records and these games should similarly not be included in these players' official total games tallies. When these war time fixtures are properly accounted for Swift's total appearances for Manchester City become 375 (not 378), Brook's total appearances for the club become 493 (not 496), Herd's total appearances for the club become 288 (not 291), and Doherty's total appearances for the club become 131 (not 134).\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)**David Silva** has won four Premier Leagues titles, two FA Cups and five League Cups with Manchester City since joining the club in 2010.\n* All of the *Player of the Year* data in the table is sourced from the history pages of the *Happy to be Blue!* web site, which lists all award winners up to, and including, season 2011–12.\n* All dates and numbers in the table are sourced from a hardcover book published in 2006 according to the inclusion / exclusion rules stated above. The individual table entries of a number of these players have subsequently been sourced from the web wherever possible.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n5. **^** Sometimes this number is reported as 159. The discrepancy lies in the Football League Division One home game played against Fulham on 16 January 2000. The cited *Soccerbase* source for Tiatto's total appearances tally reports Tiatto as having played no substitute role in this game for which it reports no substitutes were utilised by Manchester City. The main book source used for many of the statistics depicted in this article aligns itself with this team sheet report in which Tiatto replaces Mark Kennedy in the only substitution done by the home team, giving him one additional appearance.  \n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_gkYOZshcXiynVdvezBVjXhum","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
