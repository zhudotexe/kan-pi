The league consists of 30 teams, of which 29 are located in the United States and one in Canada. In the NBA, a head coach is the highest ranking coach of a coaching staff.\n\n\nGregg Popovich has served as head coach of the San Antonio Spurs for 27 years. No other current NBA head coach has been head coach of his current team as long as Popovich has been head coach of the Spurs. Popovich has also coached more games (2,127), won more games (1,366), and lost more games (761) than any other active head coach has with his current team. Miami Heat head coach Erik Spoelstra is the second longest-tenured NBA head coach, having been head coach of the Heat since the 2008–09 season. Popovich is the only active head coach inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame as a coach.[1] Popovich is the only current head coach to have been hired by his current team in the 1990s.\n\n\nAs of June 13, 2023, 15 coaches have spent their entire NBA head coaching careers with their current teams: Gregg Popovich with the San Antonio Spurs, Erik Spoelstra with the Miami Heat, Steve Kerr with the Golden State Warriors, Taylor Jenkins with the Memphis Grizzlies, Mark Daigneault with the Oklahoma City Thunder, Chris Finch with the Minnesota Timberwolves, Chauncey Billups with the Portland Trail Blazers, Jamahl Mosley with the Orlando Magic, Wes Unseld Jr. with the Washington Wizards, Willie Green with the New Orleans Pelicans, Darvin Ham with the Los Angeles Lakers, Joe Mazzulla with the Boston Celtics, Adrian Griffin with the Milwaukee Bucks, and Darko Rajaković with the Toronto Raptors.\n\n\nPopovich, Spoelstra, Kerr, and Michael Malone have won NBA championships with their current teams, while Rick Carlisle, Tyronn Lue, Nick Nurse, and Frank Vogel have won with their former teams.\n\n\n\n\n## Key[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **GC** | Games coached\n |\n| **W** | Wins\n |\n| **L** | Losses\n |\n| **Win%** | Winning percentage |\n| \\*\n | Spent entire NBA head coaching career with the current franchise\n |\n| †\n | Elected to the Basketball Hall of Fame as a coach\n |\n\n\n## Coaches[edit]\n\n\n*Note: Statistics are correct through the end of the 2022–23 season.*\n\n\n\n\n\n| Head coach\n | Team\n | Division\n | Conference\n | Start date[a] | GC\n | W\n | L\n | Win%\n | GC\n | W\n | L\n | Win%\n | Ref.\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Current[b] | Career[c] |\n| Quin Snyder | Atlanta Hawks | Southeast | Eastern | February 26, 2023 | 21 | 10 | 11 | .476\n | 657 | 382 | 275 | .581\n | [2][3] |\n| Joe Mazzulla\\*\n | Boston Celtics | Atlantic | Eastern\n | February 16, 2023 | 82 | 57 | 25 | .695\n | 82 | 57 | 25 | .695\n | [4][5][6] |\n| Jacque Vaughn | Brooklyn Nets | Atlantic\n | Eastern\n | November 1, 2022 | 75 | 43 | 32 | .573\n | 301 | 108 | 193 | .359\n | [7][8] |\n| Steve Clifford | Charlotte Hornets | Southeast\n | Eastern\n | June 24, 2022 | 82 | 27 | 55 | .329\n | 719 | 319 | 400 | .444\n | [9][10] |\n| Billy Donovan | Chicago Bulls | Central | Eastern\n | September 22, 2020 | 236 | 117 | 119 | .496\n | 636 | 360 | 276 | .566\n | [11][12] |\n| J.

It is currently topped by the 7-foot-7-inch (2.31 m) Romanian Gheorghe Mureșan, taken by the Washington Bullets as the number 30 overall pick in the 1993 NBA draft.[1]\n\n\nAs of 2023, twenty-eight players have been listed at 7 feet 3 inches (2.21 m) or taller. However, only four are active as of the 2023–24 season: Kristaps Porziņģis of the Boston Celtics (currently listed at 7 feet 2 inches (2.18 m) but was measured to be closer to 7 feet 3 inches (2.21 m) barefoot in 2019[2]); Bol Bol of the Phoenix Suns; Boban Marjanović of the Houston Rockets: and Victor Wembanyama of the San Antonio Spurs. The tallest player inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame is 7-foot-6-inch (2.29 m) Yao Ming. In addition to Yao, Ralph Sampson and Arvydas Sabonis were the only other players 7 feet 3 inches or taller selected to the Hall of Fame.\n\n\nYasutaka Okayama, a 7-foot-8-inch (2.34 m) Japanese basketball player picked 171st overall in the seventh round of the 1981 NBA draft by the Golden State Warriors, is the tallest player to ever be drafted for the NBA.[3] However, he never played in the NBA.[4]\n\n\n\n\n## List[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ^\n | Active NBA player\n |\n| \\*\n | Inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame |\n| GP | Games played | Pts | Points | PPG | Points per game\n |\n| FG% | Field goal percentage | FT% | Free throw percentage | Reb | Rebounds |\n| RPG | Rebounds per game | Blk | Blocks | BPG | Blocks per game\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Height\n | Weight\n | Player\n | Nationality\n | Teams\n | GP\n | Pts\n | PPG\n | FG%\n | FT%\n | Reb\n | RPG\n | Blk\n | BPG\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 7 ft 7 in (2.31 m)\n | 315 lb (143 kg)\n | Gheorghe Mureșan | ![](image) Romania  ![](image) United States | Washington Bullets (1993–1998)  New Jersey Nets (1998–2000)\n | 307\n | 3,020\n | 9.8\n | .573\n | .644\n | 1,957\n | 6.4\n | 455\n | 1.5\n | Won 1996 NBA Most Improved Player Award.[5] |\n| 7 ft 7 in\n(2.31 m)[note 1]\n | 200 lb (91 kg)\n | Manute Bol | ![](image) Sudan | Washington Bullets (1985–1988, 1994)  Golden State Warriors (1988–1990, 1994)  Philadelphia 76ers (1990–1993, 1994)  Miami Heat (1993–1994)\n | 625\n | 1,599\n | 2.6\n | .407\n | .561\n | 2,647\n | 4.2\n | 2,086\n | 3.3\n | Played alongside the shortest player in NBA history, Muggsy Bogues, during the 1987–88 season for the Washington Bullets; their difference in height was 28 inches (71 cm).\n |\n| 7 ft 6 in (2.29 m)\n | 311 lb (141 kg)\n | Tacko Fall | ![](image) Senegal | Boston Celtics (2019–2021)Cleveland Cavaliers (2021–2022)\n | 37\n | 82\n | 2.2\n | .673\n | .320\n | 90\n | 2.4\n | 30\n | 0.8\n |  |\n| 7 ft 6 in (2.29 m)[8][9][10] | 302 lb (137 kg)\n | Slavko Vraneš | ![](image) Montenegro | Portland Trail Blazers (2004)\n | 1\n | 0\n | 0.0\n | .000\n | —\n | 0\n | 0.0\n | 0\n | 0.0\n | Played in one game, on January 8, 2004 against the Minnesota Timberwolves.

Supporters claimed his tremendous size and surprising athleticism would allow him to dominate the league. Critics argued that he would struggle in the NBA due to his thin build – listed at just 230 pounds (100 kg), he was described by Ric Bucher of The Miami Herald as \"rail-thin,\" and Lee Rose, player personnel director for the Milwaukee Bucks at the time, said, \"Size-wise, he'll get pushed around a little bit,\"[16] – and lack of experience (just one season of college basketball, followed by a two-year hiatus from the sport due to his church mission).[17] Ultimately, he was drafted by the Philadelphia 76ers with the second overall pick, behind Chris Webber and ahead of Penny Hardaway. Given the novelty of a 7-foot-6 center playing for the 76ers, Bradley was issued jersey number 76.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Points | 6,752 (8.1 ppg) |\n| Rebounds | 5,268 (6.3 rpg) |\n| Blocks | 2,119 (2.5 bpg) |\n|  |\n| Stats ![Edit this at Wikidata](image) at NBA.com |\n| Stats ![Edit this at Wikidata](image) at Basketball-Reference.com |\n|  |\n\n\n**Shawn Paul Bradley** (born March 22, 1972) is a German-American former professional basketball player who played center for the Philadelphia 76ers, New Jersey Nets, and Dallas Mavericks of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Nicknamed \"**the Stormin' Mormon**\",[1] Bradley is one of the tallest players in NBA history at 7 ft 6 in (2.29 m). Bradley was born in Landstuhl, West Germany, as his family was stationed at the U.S. military base medical facility, and grew up in Castle Dale, Utah.[2][3] He holds citizenship in both the United States and Germany.[4][5]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBradley returned to full strength in his second season, playing in all 82 games for the 76ers. His scoring actually declined slightly (9.5 points per game), but his rebounding and shot-blocking increased. He racked up 274 rejections, setting a franchise record for most blocks in a single season. Bradley gave Philly fans a glimpse of his potential in a game against the Los Angeles Clippers in November, posting career highs of 28 points and 22 rebounds in a 97–83 victory. He also tied a career high with 9 blocked shots, and was credited with 9 additional \"intimidations\" as the Clippers were held to their lowest-ever point total against the 76ers.[22] He finished the season in strong fashion, posting 13 double-doubles in his last 17 games.\n\n\n\n### New Jersey Nets (1995–1997)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDespite these highlights, Bradley continued to baffle and frustrate Philadelphia with his inconsistent play. Just 12 games into his third season (1995–96), the 76ers traded Bradley to the New Jersey Nets for Derrick Coleman. He played the final 67 games of the year with the Nets, and tantalized Nets fans with some strong play in the second half of the season. In February, he dominated a match-up against fellow giant Gheorghe Mureșan, leading the Nets to a 99–81 victory against the Washington Bullets. Bradley scored a season-high 27 points over the 7-foot-7 Mureşan, and also added 9 rebounds and 4 blocked shots.[23]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Year\n | Team\n | GP | GS | MPG | FG% | 3P% | FT% | RPG | APG | SPG | BPG | PPG |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1993–94 | Philadelphia | 49 | 45 | 28.3 | .409 | .000 | .607 | 6.2 | **2.0** | **0.9** | 3.0 | 10.3\n |\n| 1994–95 | Philadelphia | **82**\\* | **59** | 28.8 | .455 | .000 | .638 | 8.0 | 0.6 | 0.7 | 3.3 | 9.5\n |\n| 1995–96 | Philadelphia | 12 | 11 | 27.8 | .443 | .000 | .760 | **8.8** | 0.7 | 0.7 | 3.2 | 8.8\n |\n| 1995–96 | New Jersey | 67 | 57 | 29.8 | .443 | .250 | .679 | 7.9 | 0.8 | 0.6 | 3.7 | 12.5\n |\n| 1996–97 | New Jersey | 40 | 38 | 30.7 | .436 | .000 | .664 | 8.1 | 0.5 | 0.6 | **4.0\\*** | 12.0\n |\n| 1996–97 | Dallas | 33 | 32 | **32.1** | .461 | .000 | .642 | 8.7 | 1.0 | 0.5 | 2.7 | **14.6** |\n| 1997–98 | Dallas | 64 | 46 | 28.5 | .422 | **.333** | .722 | 8.1 | 0.9 | 0.8 | 3.3 | 11.4\n |\n| 1998–99 | Dallas | 49 | 33 | 26.4 | .480 | .000 | .748 | 8.0 | 0.8 | 0.7 | 3.2 | 8.6\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPhiladelphia's management saw Bradley as a major project with huge long-term potential. The team acquired legendary big man Moses Malone to serve as a mentor for Bradley, hoping to develop his skills in the low post.[18] Also, the franchise hired strength and conditioning consultant Pat Croce and registered dietitian Jeanie Subach, as well as assistant coach Jeff Ruland, to add bulk to Bradley's skinny frame.[19] His rookie season (1993–94) produced mixed results. In his first game, Bradley totaled just 6 points and 5 rebounds, but he did manage to block 8 shots in 25 minutes.[20]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n20. **^** \"No Jordan? No Sweat.

Bradley came from a tall family: his father Reiner Bradley (1949–2010) was 6 ft 8 in (2.03 m) tall, and his mother Teresa was 6 ft 0 in (1.83 m).[6] Bradley was already 6 ft 8 in (2.03 m) by the end of junior high school (age 13–14), and by the end of his junior year of high school (age 16–17) he had grown to 7 ft 5 in (2.26 m), one inch shy of his adult height of 7 ft 6 in (2.29 m).[7] In 2018, genetic analysis of Bradley's DNA showed that his great height is not the result of any physical or genetic disorders, but because he happened to inherit a natural but extremely rare combination of the thousands of genetic variants that determine human height.[8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBradley lifted his game to new levels in March 1996. He posted a career-high 32 points and added 15 rebounds against Dallas early in the month,[24] and set another career high a week later with 10 blocked shots against the Phoenix Suns. He recorded his first career triple-double in the very next game, tallying 19 points, 17 rebounds, and a career-best 11 blocked shots in another match-up against Mureşan and the Bullets. In April, Bradley posted back-to-back triple-doubles (against Boston and Toronto); in the process, he became the first player in NBA history to record consecutive games of double-figure blocked shots twice in a single season.[25] His season averages for 1995–96 were 11.9 points, 8.1 rebounds, and 3.7 blocks per game[26]—all career highs.\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_2EgOM5RoxGBgIZGTMwCNtfea","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

He also plays for the Serbian national basketball team in international competitions. In 2015, he earned an All-EuroLeague First Team selection. He is also an actor, having appeared in several films. At 2.24 m (7 ft 4 in) tall, he is tied with Victor Wembanyama as the tallest active NBA player. He signed his first ever NBA contract as a 27 year old rookie in 2015 by the Spurs. He also played for the Detroit Pistons, Los Angeles Clippers, Philadelphia 76ers and Dallas Mavericks.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nMarjanović was born and raised in Boljevac in eastern Serbia. Although he was tall from a young age, his family members are all of average height: his father stands only 5 ft 9 in (1.75 m) tall.[2] A pituitary gland condition is thought to have contributed to his gigantism.[3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Year\n | Team\n | GP | GS | MPG | FG% | 3P% | FT% | RPG | APG | SPG | BPG | PPG |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2015–16 | San Antonio | **54** | 4 | 9.4 | .603 | — | .763 | 3.6 | .4 | .2 | .4 | 5.5\n |\n| 2016–17 | Detroit | 35 | 0 | 8.4 | .545 | — | .810 | 3.7 | .3 | .2 | .3 | 5.5\n |\n| 2017–18 | Detroit | 19 | 1 | 9.0 | .519 | — | .800 | 3.0 | .7 | .2 | .3 | 6.2\n |\n| L.A.

Supporters claimed his tremendous size and surprising athleticism would allow him to dominate the league. Critics argued that he would struggle in the NBA due to his thin build – listed at just 230 pounds (100 kg), he was described by Ric Bucher of The Miami Herald as \"rail-thin,\" and Lee Rose, player personnel director for the Milwaukee Bucks at the time, said, \"Size-wise, he'll get pushed around a little bit,\"[16] – and lack of experience (just one season of college basketball, followed by a two-year hiatus from the sport due to his church mission).[17] Ultimately, he was drafted by the Philadelphia 76ers with the second overall pick, behind Chris Webber and ahead of Penny Hardaway. Given the novelty of a 7-foot-6 center playing for the 76ers, Bradley was issued jersey number 76.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Points | 6,752 (8.1 ppg) |\n| Rebounds | 5,268 (6.3 rpg) |\n| Blocks | 2,119 (2.5 bpg) |\n|  |\n| Stats ![Edit this at Wikidata](image) at NBA.com |\n| Stats ![Edit this at Wikidata](image) at Basketball-Reference.com |\n|  |\n\n\n**Shawn Paul Bradley** (born March 22, 1972) is a German-American former professional basketball player who played center for the Philadelphia 76ers, New Jersey Nets, and Dallas Mavericks of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Nicknamed \"**the Stormin' Mormon**\",[1] Bradley is one of the tallest players in NBA history at 7 ft 6 in (2.29 m). Bradley was born in Landstuhl, West Germany, as his family was stationed at the U.S. military base medical facility, and grew up in Castle Dale, Utah.[2][3] He holds citizenship in both the United States and Germany.[4][5]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBradley returned to full strength in his second season, playing in all 82 games for the 76ers. His scoring actually declined slightly (9.5 points per game), but his rebounding and shot-blocking increased. He racked up 274 rejections, setting a franchise record for most blocks in a single season. Bradley gave Philly fans a glimpse of his potential in a game against the Los Angeles Clippers in November, posting career highs of 28 points and 22 rebounds in a 97–83 victory. He also tied a career high with 9 blocked shots, and was credited with 9 additional \"intimidations\" as the Clippers were held to their lowest-ever point total against the 76ers.[22] He finished the season in strong fashion, posting 13 double-doubles in his last 17 games.\n\n\n\n### New Jersey Nets (1995–1997)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDespite these highlights, Bradley continued to baffle and frustrate Philadelphia with his inconsistent play. Just 12 games into his third season (1995–96), the 76ers traded Bradley to the New Jersey Nets for Derrick Coleman. He played the final 67 games of the year with the Nets, and tantalized Nets fans with some strong play in the second half of the season. In February, he dominated a match-up against fellow giant Gheorghe Mureșan, leading the Nets to a 99–81 victory against the Washington Bullets. Bradley scored a season-high 27 points over the 7-foot-7 Mureşan, and also added 9 rebounds and 4 blocked shots.[23]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n20. **^** \"No Jordan? No Sweat.

The team acquired legendary big man Moses Malone to serve as a mentor for Bradley, hoping to develop his skills in the low post.[18] Also, the franchise hired strength and conditioning consultant Pat Croce and registered dietitian Jeanie Subach, as well as assistant coach Jeff Ruland, to add bulk to Bradley's skinny frame.[19] His rookie season (1993–94) produced mixed results. In his first game, Bradley totaled just 6 points and 5 rebounds, but he did manage to block 8 shots in 25 minutes.[20]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Year\n | Team\n | GP | GS | MPG | FG% | 3P% | FT% | RPG | APG | SPG | BPG | PPG |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1993–94 | Philadelphia | 49 | 45 | 28.3 | .409 | .000 | .607 | 6.2 | **2.0** | **0.9** | 3.0 | 10.3\n |\n| 1994–95 | Philadelphia | **82**\\* | **59** | 28.8 | .455 | .000 | .638 | 8.0 | 0.6 | 0.7 | 3.3 | 9.5\n |\n| 1995–96 | Philadelphia | 12 | 11 | 27.8 | .443 | .000 | .760 | **8.8** | 0.7 | 0.7 | 3.2 | 8.8\n |\n| 1995–96 | New Jersey | 67 | 57 | 29.8 | .443 | .250 | .679 | 7.9 | 0.8 | 0.6 | 3.7 | 12.5\n |\n| 1996–97 | New Jersey | 40 | 38 | 30.7 | .436 | .000 | .664 | 8.1 | 0.5 | 0.6 | **4.0\\*** | 12.0\n |\n| 1996–97 | Dallas | 33 | 32 | **32.1** | .461 | .000 | .642 | 8.7 | 1.0 | 0.5 | 2.7 | **14.6** |\n| 1997–98 | Dallas | 64 | 46 | 28.5 | .422 | **.333** | .722 | 8.1 | 0.9 | 0.8 | 3.3 | 11.4\n |\n| 1998–99 | Dallas | 49 | 33 | 26.4 | .480 | .000 | .748 | 8.0 | 0.8 | 0.7 | 3.2 | 8.6\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nShawn Bradley| ![](image)Bradley in 2008\n |\n| Personal information |\n| Born |  (1972-03-22) March 22, 1972 (age 52)Landstuhl, West Germany |\n| Nationality | German / American |\n| Listed height | 7 ft 6 in (2.29 m) |\n| Listed weight | 275 lb (125 kg) |\n| Career information |\n| High school | Emery (Castle Dale, Utah) |\n| College | BYU (1990–1991) |\n| NBA draft | 1993: 1st round, 2nd overall pick |\n| Selected by the Philadelphia 76ers |\n| Playing career | 1993–2005 |\n| Position | Center |\n| Number | 76, 45, 44 |\n| Career history |\n| 1993–1995 | Philadelphia 76ers |\n| 1995–1997 | New Jersey Nets |\n| 1997–2005 | Dallas Mavericks |\n|  |\n| Career highlights and awards |\n| * NBA All-Rookie Second Team (1994)\n* NBA blocks leader (1997)\n* NCAA blocks leader (1991)\n* Second-team All-WAC (1991)\n* WAC Freshman of the Year (1991)\n* Second-team *Parade* All-American (1990)\n* Third-team *Parade* All-American (1989)\n* McDonald's All-American Co-MVP (1990)\n* Utah Mr. Basketball (1989)\n |\n|  |\n| Career NBA statistics |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nMcDonald's All-American Game – Boys' MVPs\n |\n| --- |\n| * 1978: Woods\n* 1979: Daye\n* 1980: Cross\n* 1981: Branch & Sherrod\n* 1982: Winters\n* 1983: Bennett\n* 1984: Williams\n* 1985: Lambiotte\n* 1986: Reid\n* 1987: Macon\n* 1988: Mourning & Owens\n* 1989: Hurley & O'Neal\n* 1990: Bradley\n* 1991: Webber & Brunson\n* 1992: Harrington\n* 1993: Vaughn & Stackhouse\n* 1994: López\n* 1995: Garnett\n* 1996: Holloway\n* 1997: Gregory\n* 1998: R.

Bradley came from a tall family: his father Reiner Bradley (1949–2010) was 6 ft 8 in (2.03 m) tall, and his mother Teresa was 6 ft 0 in (1.83 m).[6] Bradley was already 6 ft 8 in (2.03 m) by the end of junior high school (age 13–14), and by the end of his junior year of high school (age 16–17) he had grown to 7 ft 5 in (2.26 m), one inch shy of his adult height of 7 ft 6 in (2.29 m).[7] In 2018, genetic analysis of Bradley's DNA showed that his great height is not the result of any physical or genetic disorders, but because he happened to inherit a natural but extremely rare combination of the thousands of genetic variants that determine human height.[8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBradley had a role in the film *Space Jam* in 1996,[40] depicted as one of the NBA stars who lose their talent alongside Muggsy Bogues, Larry Johnson, Charles Barkley, and Patrick Ewing. He also appeared as himself in an episode of *Walker, Texas Ranger*,[40] and had a cameo appearance as an auto mechanic in *The Singles Ward* movie.[40] In 2011, he appeared in a music video tribute to Jimmer Fredette, along with former BYU football star Chad Lewis and legendary coach LaVell Edwards.[41] He has also appeared in an episode of *Studio C*.[42]\n\n\nBradley was featured in the ESPN 30 for 30 short documentary \"Posterized\" given his propensity \"for being on the wrong end of a lot of great dunks.\"[43]\n\n\n\n## NBA career statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_pSlRQsRQK4VVkWkJyQbk6JGJ","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

He also plays for the Serbian national basketball team in international competitions. In 2015, he earned an All-EuroLeague First Team selection. He is also an actor, having appeared in several films. At 2.24 m (7 ft 4 in) tall, he is tied with Victor Wembanyama as the tallest active NBA player. He signed his first ever NBA contract as a 27 year old rookie in 2015 by the Spurs. He also played for the Detroit Pistons, Los Angeles Clippers, Philadelphia 76ers and Dallas Mavericks.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nMarjanović was born and raised in Boljevac in eastern Serbia. Although he was tall from a young age, his family members are all of average height: his father stands only 5 ft 9 in (1.75 m) tall.[2] A pituitary gland condition is thought to have contributed to his gigantism.[3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Year\n | Team\n | GP | GS | MPG | FG% | 3P% | FT% | RPG | APG | SPG | BPG | PPG |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2015–16 | San Antonio | **54** | 4 | 9.4 | .603 | — | .763 | 3.6 | .4 | .2 | .4 | 5.5\n |\n| 2016–17 | Detroit | 35 | 0 | 8.4 | .545 | — | .810 | 3.7 | .3 | .2 | .3 | 5.5\n |\n| 2017–18 | Detroit | 19 | 1 | 9.0 | .519 | — | .800 | 3.0 | .7 | .2 | .3 | 6.2\n |\n| L.A.
