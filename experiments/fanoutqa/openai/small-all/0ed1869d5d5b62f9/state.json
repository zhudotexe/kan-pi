The league consists of 30 teams, of which 29 are located in the United States and one in Canada. In the NBA, a head coach is the highest ranking coach of a coaching staff.\n\n\nGregg Popovich has served as head coach of the San Antonio Spurs for 27 years. No other current NBA head coach has been head coach of his current team as long as Popovich has been head coach of the Spurs. Popovich has also coached more games (2,127), won more games (1,366), and lost more games (761) than any other active head coach has with his current team. Miami Heat head coach Erik Spoelstra is the second longest-tenured NBA head coach, having been head coach of the Heat since the 2008\u201309 season.

Supporters claimed his tremendous size and surprising athleticism would allow him to dominate the league. Critics argued that he would struggle in the NBA due to his thin build \u2013 listed at just 230 pounds (100\u00a0kg), he was described by Ric Bucher of The Miami Herald as \"rail-thin,\" and Lee Rose, player personnel director for the Milwaukee Bucks at the time, said, \"Size-wise, he'll get pushed around a little bit,\"[16] \u2013 and lack of experience (just one season of college basketball, followed by a two-year hiatus from the sport due to his church mission).[17] Ultimately, he was drafted by the Philadelphia 76ers with the second overall pick, behind Chris Webber and ahead of Penny Hardaway. Given the novelty of a 7-foot-6 center playing for the 76ers, Bradley was issued jersey number 76.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Points | 6,752 (8.1 ppg) |\n| Rebounds | 5,268 (6.3 rpg) |\n| Blocks | 2,119 (2.5 bpg) |\n|  |\n| Stats\u00a0![Edit this at Wikidata](image) at NBA.com |\n| Stats\u00a0![Edit this at Wikidata](image) at Basketball-Reference.com |\n|  |\n\n\n**Shawn Paul Bradley** (born March 22, 1972) is a German-American former professional basketball player who played center for the Philadelphia 76ers, New Jersey Nets, and Dallas Mavericks of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Nicknamed \"**the Stormin' Mormon**\",[1] Bradley is one of the tallest players in NBA history at 7\u00a0ft 6\u00a0in (2.29\u00a0m). Bradley was born in Landstuhl, West Germany, as his family was stationed at the U.S. military base medical facility, and grew up in Castle Dale, Utah.[2][3] He holds citizenship in both the United States and Germany.[4][5]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBradley returned to full strength in his second season, playing in all 82 games for the 76ers. His scoring actually declined slightly (9.5 points per game), but his rebounding and shot-blocking increased. He racked up 274 rejections, setting a franchise record for most blocks in a single season. Bradley gave Philly fans a glimpse of his potential in a game against the Los Angeles Clippers in November, posting career highs of 28 points and 22 rebounds in a 97\u201383 victory. He also tied a career high with 9 blocked shots, and was credited with 9 additional \"intimidations\" as the Clippers were held to their lowest-ever point total against the 76ers.[22] He finished the season in strong fashion, posting 13 double-doubles in his last 17 games.\n\n\n\n### New Jersey Nets (1995\u20131997)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDespite these highlights, Bradley continued to baffle and frustrate Philadelphia with his inconsistent play. Just 12 games into his third season (1995\u201396), the 76ers traded Bradley to the New Jersey Nets for Derrick Coleman. He played the final 67 games of the year with the Nets, and tantalized Nets fans with some strong play in the second half of the season. In February, he dominated a match-up against fellow giant Gheorghe Mure\u0219an, leading the Nets to a 99\u201381 victory against the Washington Bullets. Bradley scored a season-high 27 points over the 7-foot-7 Mure\u015fan, and also added 9 rebounds and 4 blocked shots.[23]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Year\n | Team\n | GP | GS | MPG | FG% | 3P% | FT% | RPG | APG | SPG | BPG | PPG |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1993\u201394 | Philadelphia | 49 | 45 | 28.3 | .409 | .000 | .607 | 6.2 | **2.0** | **0.9** | 3.0 | 10.3\n |\n| 1994\u201395 | Philadelphia | **82**\\* | **59** | 28.8 | .455 | .000 | .638 | 8.0 | 0.6 | 0.7 | 3.3 | 9.5\n |\n| 1995\u201396 | Philadelphia | 12 | 11 | 27.8 | .443 | .000 | .760 | **8.8** | 0.7 | 0.7 | 3.2 | 8.8\n |\n| 1995\u201396 | New Jersey | 67 | 57 | 29.8 | .443 | .250 | .679 | 7.9 | 0.8 | 0.6 | 3.7 | 12.5\n |\n| 1996\u201397 | New Jersey | 40 | 38 | 30.7 | .436 | .000 | .664 | 8.1 | 0.5 | 0.6 | **4.0\\*** | 12.0\n |\n| 1996\u201397 | Dallas | 33 | 32 | **32.1** | .461 | .000 | .642 | 8.7 | 1.0 | 0.5 | 2.7 | **14.6** |\n| 1997\u201398 | Dallas | 64 | 46 | 28.5 | .422 | **.333** | .722 | 8.1 | 0.9 | 0.8 | 3.3 | 11.4\n |\n| 1998\u201399 | Dallas | 49 | 33 | 26.4 | .480 | .000 | .748 | 8.0 | 0.8 | 0.7 | 3.2 | 8.6\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPhiladelphia's management saw Bradley as a major project with huge long-term potential. The team acquired legendary big man Moses Malone to serve as a mentor for Bradley, hoping to develop his skills in the low post.[18] Also, the franchise hired strength and conditioning consultant Pat Croce and registered dietitian Jeanie Subach, as well as assistant coach Jeff Ruland, to add bulk to Bradley's skinny frame.[19] His rookie season (1993\u201394) produced mixed results. In his first game, Bradley totaled just 6 points and 5 rebounds, but he did manage to block 8 shots in 25 minutes.[20]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n20. **^** \"No Jordan? No Sweat.

Bradley came from a tall family: his father Reiner Bradley (1949\u20132010) was 6\u00a0ft 8\u00a0in (2.03\u00a0m) tall, and his mother Teresa was 6\u00a0ft 0\u00a0in (1.83\u00a0m).[6] Bradley was already 6\u00a0ft 8\u00a0in (2.03\u00a0m) by the end of junior high school (age 13\u201314), and by the end of his junior year of high school (age 16\u201317) he had grown to 7\u00a0ft 5\u00a0in (2.26\u00a0m), one inch shy of his adult height of 7\u00a0ft 6\u00a0in (2.29\u00a0m).[7] In 2018, genetic analysis of Bradley's DNA showed that his great height is not the result of any physical or genetic disorders, but because he happened to inherit a natural but extremely rare combination of the thousands of genetic variants that determine human height.[8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBradley lifted his game to new levels in March 1996. He posted a career-high 32 points and added 15 rebounds against Dallas early in the month,[24] and set another career high a week later with 10 blocked shots against the Phoenix Suns. He recorded his first career triple-double in the very next game, tallying 19 points, 17 rebounds, and a career-best 11 blocked shots in another match-up against Mure\u015fan and the Bullets. In April, Bradley posted back-to-back triple-doubles (against Boston and Toronto); in the process, he became the first player in NBA history to record consecutive games of double-figure blocked shots twice in a single season.[25] His season averages for 1995\u201396 were 11.9 points, 8.1 rebounds, and 3.7 blocks per game[26]\u2014all career highs.\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Supporters claimed his tremendous size and surprising athleticism would allow him to dominate the league. Critics argued that he would struggle in the NBA due to his thin build \u2013 listed at just 230 pounds (100\u00a0kg), he was described by Ric Bucher of The Miami Herald as \"rail-thin,\" and Lee Rose, player personnel director for the Milwaukee Bucks at the time, said, \"Size-wise, he'll get pushed around a little bit,\"[16] \u2013 and lack of experience (just one season of college basketball, followed by a two-year hiatus from the sport due to his church mission).[17] Ultimately, he was drafted by the Philadelphia 76ers with the second overall pick, behind Chris Webber and ahead of Penny Hardaway. Given the novelty of a 7-foot-6 center playing for the 76ers, Bradley was issued jersey number 76.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Points | 6,752 (8.1 ppg) |\n| Rebounds | 5,268 (6.3 rpg) |\n| Blocks | 2,119 (2.5 bpg) |\n|  |\n| Stats\u00a0![Edit this at Wikidata](image) at NBA.com |\n| Stats\u00a0![Edit this at Wikidata](image) at Basketball-Reference.com |\n|  |\n\n\n**Shawn Paul Bradley** (born March 22, 1972) is a German-American former professional basketball player who played center for the Philadelphia 76ers, New Jersey Nets, and Dallas Mavericks of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Nicknamed \"**the Stormin' Mormon**\",[1] Bradley is one of the tallest players in NBA history at 7\u00a0ft 6\u00a0in (2.29\u00a0m). Bradley was born in Landstuhl, West Germany, as his family was stationed at the U.S. military base medical facility, and grew up in Castle Dale, Utah.[2][3] He holds citizenship in both the United States and Germany.[4][5]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBradley returned to full strength in his second season, playing in all 82 games for the 76ers. His scoring actually declined slightly (9.5 points per game), but his rebounding and shot-blocking increased. He racked up 274 rejections, setting a franchise record for most blocks in a single season. Bradley gave Philly fans a glimpse of his potential in a game against the Los Angeles Clippers in November, posting career highs of 28 points and 22 rebounds in a 97\u201383 victory. He also tied a career high with 9 blocked shots, and was credited with 9 additional \"intimidations\" as the Clippers were held to their lowest-ever point total against the 76ers.[22] He finished the season in strong fashion, posting 13 double-doubles in his last 17 games.\n\n\n\n### New Jersey Nets (1995\u20131997)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDespite these highlights, Bradley continued to baffle and frustrate Philadelphia with his inconsistent play. Just 12 games into his third season (1995\u201396), the 76ers traded Bradley to the New Jersey Nets for Derrick Coleman. He played the final 67 games of the year with the Nets, and tantalized Nets fans with some strong play in the second half of the season. In February, he dominated a match-up against fellow giant Gheorghe Mure\u0219an, leading the Nets to a 99\u201381 victory against the Washington Bullets. Bradley scored a season-high 27 points over the 7-foot-7 Mure\u015fan, and also added 9 rebounds and 4 blocked shots.[23]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n20. **^** \"No Jordan? No Sweat.

The team acquired legendary big man Moses Malone to serve as a mentor for Bradley, hoping to develop his skills in the low post.[18] Also, the franchise hired strength and conditioning consultant Pat Croce and registered dietitian Jeanie Subach, as well as assistant coach Jeff Ruland, to add bulk to Bradley's skinny frame.[19] His rookie season (1993\u201394) produced mixed results. In his first game, Bradley totaled just 6 points and 5 rebounds, but he did manage to block 8 shots in 25 minutes.[20]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Year\n | Team\n | GP | GS | MPG | FG% | 3P% | FT% | RPG | APG | SPG | BPG | PPG |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1993\u201394 | Philadelphia | 49 | 45 | 28.3 | .409 | .000 | .607 | 6.2 | **2.0** | **0.9** | 3.0 | 10.3\n |\n| 1994\u201395 | Philadelphia | **82**\\* | **59** | 28.8 | .455 | .000 | .638 | 8.0 | 0.6 | 0.7 | 3.3 | 9.5\n |\n| 1995\u201396 | Philadelphia | 12 | 11 | 27.8 | .443 | .000 | .760 | **8.8** | 0.7 | 0.7 | 3.2 | 8.8\n |\n| 1995\u201396 | New Jersey | 67 | 57 | 29.8 | .443 | .250 | .679 | 7.9 | 0.8 | 0.6 | 3.7 | 12.5\n |\n| 1996\u201397 | New Jersey | 40 | 38 | 30.7 | .436 | .000 | .664 | 8.1 | 0.5 | 0.6 | **4.0\\*** | 12.0\n |\n| 1996\u201397 | Dallas | 33 | 32 | **32.1** | .461 | .000 | .642 | 8.7 | 1.0 | 0.5 | 2.7 | **14.6** |\n| 1997\u201398 | Dallas | 64 | 46 | 28.5 | .422 | **.333** | .722 | 8.1 | 0.9 | 0.8 | 3.3 | 11.4\n |\n| 1998\u201399 | Dallas | 49 | 33 | 26.4 | .480 | .000 | .748 | 8.0 | 0.8 | 0.7 | 3.2 | 8.6\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nShawn Bradley| ![](image)Bradley in 2008\n |\n| Personal information |\n| Born |  (1972-03-22) March 22, 1972 (age\u00a052)Landstuhl, West Germany |\n| Nationality | German / American |\n| Listed height | 7\u00a0ft 6\u00a0in (2.29\u00a0m) |\n| Listed weight | 275\u00a0lb (125\u00a0kg) |\n| Career information |\n| High school | Emery (Castle Dale, Utah) |\n| College | BYU (1990\u20131991) |\n| NBA draft | 1993: 1st round, 2nd overall pick |\n| Selected by the Philadelphia 76ers |\n| Playing career | 1993\u20132005 |\n| Position | Center |\n| Number | 76, 45, 44 |\n| Career history |\n| 1993\u20131995 | Philadelphia 76ers |\n| 1995\u20131997 | New Jersey Nets |\n| 1997\u20132005 | Dallas Mavericks |\n|  |\n| Career highlights and awards |\n| * NBA All-Rookie Second Team (1994)\n* NBA blocks leader (1997)\n* NCAA blocks leader (1991)\n* Second-team All-WAC (1991)\n* WAC Freshman of the Year (1991)\n* Second-team *Parade* All-American (1990)\n* Third-team *Parade* All-American (1989)\n* McDonald's All-American Co-MVP (1990)\n* Utah Mr. Basketball (1989)\n |\n|  |\n| Career NBA statistics |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nMcDonald's All-American Game \u2013 Boys' MVPs\n |\n| --- |\n| * 1978: Woods\n* 1979: Daye\n* 1980: Cross\n* 1981: Branch & Sherrod\n* 1982: Winters\n* 1983: Bennett\n* 1984: Williams\n* 1985: Lambiotte\n* 1986: Reid\n* 1987: Macon\n* 1988: Mourning & Owens\n* 1989: Hurley & O'Neal\n* 1990: Bradley\n* 1991: Webber & Brunson\n* 1992: Harrington\n* 1993: Vaughn & Stackhouse\n* 1994: L\u00f3pez\n* 1995: Garnett\n* 1996: Holloway\n* 1997: Gregory\n* 1998: R.

Bradley came from a tall family: his father Reiner Bradley (1949\u20132010) was 6\u00a0ft 8\u00a0in (2.03\u00a0m) tall, and his mother Teresa was 6\u00a0ft 0\u00a0in (1.83\u00a0m).[6] Bradley was already 6\u00a0ft 8\u00a0in (2.03\u00a0m) by the end of junior high school (age 13\u201314), and by the end of his junior year of high school (age 16\u201317) he had grown to 7\u00a0ft 5\u00a0in (2.26\u00a0m), one inch shy of his adult height of 7\u00a0ft 6\u00a0in (2.29\u00a0m).[7] In 2018, genetic analysis of Bradley's DNA showed that his great height is not the result of any physical or genetic disorders, but because he happened to inherit a natural but extremely rare combination of the thousands of genetic variants that determine human height.[8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBradley had a role in the film *Space Jam* in 1996,[40] depicted as one of the NBA stars who lose their talent alongside Muggsy Bogues, Larry Johnson, Charles Barkley, and Patrick Ewing. He also appeared as himself in an episode of *Walker, Texas Ranger*,[40] and had a cameo appearance as an auto mechanic in *The Singles Ward* movie.[40] In 2011, he appeared in a music video tribute to Jimmer Fredette, along with former BYU football star Chad Lewis and legendary coach LaVell Edwards.[41] He has also appeared in an episode of *Studio C*.[42]\n\n\nBradley was featured in the ESPN 30 for 30 short documentary \"Posterized\" given his propensity \"for being on the wrong end of a lot of great dunks.\"[43]\n\n\n\n## NBA career statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
