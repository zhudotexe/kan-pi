It has an angular diameter of between 8' (rising) and 12' (overhead). Due to its close orbit, it would look smaller when the observer is further away from the Martian equator and is below the horizon and thus not visible from Mars's polar ice caps. Deimos looks more like a bright star or planet for an observer on Mars, only slightly bigger than Venus looks from Earth; it has an angular diameter of about 2'. The Sun's angular diameter as seen from Mars, by contrast, is about 21'. Thus there are no total solar eclipses on Mars, as the moons are far too small to completely cover the Sun. On the other hand, total lunar eclipses of Phobos happen almost every night.[25]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n6. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Close Inspection for Phobos\".

Ares, the god of war, was known to the Romans as Mars.\n\n\nCompared to the Earth's Moon, the moons Phobos and Deimos are small. Phobos has a diameter of 22.2 km (13.8 mi) and a mass of 1.08×1016 kg, while Deimos measures 12.6 km (7.8 mi) across, with a mass of 2.0×1015 kg. Phobos orbits closer to Mars, with a semi-major axis of 9,377 km (5,827 mi) and an orbital period of 7.66 hours; while Deimos orbits farther with a semi-major axis of 23,460 km (14,580 mi) and an orbital period of 30.35 hours.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_ZdfLvmieALbiAoHUEhetDE7o","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

The most massive of the moons are the four Galilean moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto, which were independently discovered in 1610 by Galileo Galilei and Simon Marius and were the first objects found to orbit a body that was neither Earth nor the Sun. Much more recently, beginning in 1892, dozens of far smaller Jovian moons have been detected and have received the names of lovers (or other sexual partners) or daughters of the Roman god Jupiter or his Greek equivalent Zeus. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n\n**Discovery of outer planet moons**\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

The astronomical literature instead simply referred to \"Jupiter I\", \"Jupiter II\", etc., or \"the first satellite of Jupiter\", \"Jupiter's second satellite\", and so on.[44] The names Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto became popular in the mid-20th century,[45] whereas the rest of the moons remained unnamed and were usually numbered in Roman numerals V (5) to XII (12).[46][47] Jupiter V was discovered in 1892 and given the name *Amalthea* by a popular though unofficial convention, a name first used by French astronomer Camille Flammarion.[48][49]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)A montage of Jupiter and its four largest moons (distance and sizes not to scale)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNames ending with \"a\" or \"o\" are used for prograde irregular satellites (the latter for highly inclined satellites), and names ending with \"e\" are used for retrograde irregulars.[26] With the discovery of smaller, kilometre-sized moons around Jupiter, the IAU has established an additional convention to limit the naming of small moons with absolute magnitudes greater than 18 or diameters smaller than 1 km (0.6 mi).[52] Some of the most recently confirmed moons have not received names.[4]\n\n\nSome asteroids share the same names as moons of Jupiter: 9 Metis, 38 Leda, 52 Europa, 85 Io, 113 Amalthea, 239 Adrastea. Two more asteroids previously shared the names of Jovian moons until spelling differences were made permanent by the IAU: Ganymede and asteroid 1036 Ganymed; and Callisto and asteroid 204 Kallisto.\n\n\n\n## Groups[edit]\n\n\n### Regular satellites[edit]\n\n\nThese have prograde and nearly circular orbits of low inclination and are split into two groups:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)The Galilean moons. From left to right, in order of increasing distance from Jupiter: Io; Europa; Ganymede; Callisto.\nThe physical and orbital characteristics of the moons vary widely. The four Galileans are all over 3,100 kilometres (1,900 mi) in diameter; the largest Galilean, Ganymede, is the ninth largest object in the Solar System, after the Sun and seven of the planets, Ganymede being larger than Mercury. All other Jovian moons are less than 250 kilometres (160 mi) in diameter, with most barely exceeding 5 kilometres (3.1 mi).[note 2] Their orbital shapes range from nearly perfectly circular to highly eccentric and inclined, and many revolve in the direction opposite to Jupiter's rotation (retrograde motion). Orbital periods range from seven hours (taking less time than Jupiter does to rotate around its axis), to almost three Earth years.\n\n\n\n## Origin and evolution[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)The relative masses of the Jovian moons. Those smaller than Europa are not visible at this scale, and combined would only be visible at 100× magnification.\nJupiter's regular satellites are believed to have formed from a circumplanetary disk, a ring of accreting gas and solid debris analogous to a protoplanetary disk.[6][7] They may be the remnants of a score of Galilean-mass satellites that formed early in Jupiter's history.[6][8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* ***Inner satellites*** or ***Amalthea group***: Metis, Adrastea, Amalthea, and Thebe. These orbit very close to Jupiter; the innermost two orbit in less than a Jovian day. The latter two are respectively the fifth and seventh largest moons in the Jovian system. Observations suggest that at least the largest member, Amalthea, did not form on its present orbit, but farther from the planet, or that it is a captured Solar System body.[53] These moons, along with a number of seen and as-yet-unseen inner moonlets (see Amalthea moonlets), replenish and maintain Jupiter's faint ring system. Metis and Adrastea help to maintain Jupiter's main ring, whereas Amalthea and Thebe each maintain their own faint outer rings.[54][55]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNatural satellites of the planet Jupiter\n\nFor other uses, see Moons of Jupiter (disambiguation).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** \"Planetary Satellite Discovery Circumstances\". *JPL Solar System Dynamics*.

Absolute magnitudes of irregular satellites were taken from the Minor Planet Center's Natural Satellites Ephemeris Service.[84] Calculations were made with NASA/JPL's Asteroid Size Estimator.[85]\n7. **^**  The diameters and dimensions of the small inner moons, from Pan to Helene, are taken from Thomas et al., 2020, Table 1.[86] Diameters and dimensions of Mimas, Enceladus, Tethys, Dione, Rhea, Iapetus, and Phoebe are from Thomas 2010, Table 1.[40] Diameters of Siarnaq and Albiorix are from Grav et al., 2015, Table 3.[81] The approximate sizes of all other irregular satellites are calculated from their absolute magnitudes with an assumed geometric albedo of 0.04,[85] which is the average value for that population.[81]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n2. **^**  The mass of the rings is about the mass of Mimas,[9] whereas the combined mass of Janus, Hyperion and Phoebe—the most massive of the remaining moons—is about one-third of that.

It has an angular diameter of between 8' (rising) and 12' (overhead). Due to its close orbit, it would look smaller when the observer is further away from the Martian equator and is below the horizon and thus not visible from Mars's polar ice caps. Deimos looks more like a bright star or planet for an observer on Mars, only slightly bigger than Venus looks from Earth; it has an angular diameter of about 2'. The Sun's angular diameter as seen from Mars, by contrast, is about 21'. Thus there are no total solar eclipses on Mars, as the moons are far too small to completely cover the Sun. On the other hand, total lunar eclipses of Phobos happen almost every night.[25]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n6. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Close Inspection for Phobos\".

The most massive of the moons are the four Galilean moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto, which were independently discovered in 1610 by Galileo Galilei and Simon Marius and were the first objects found to orbit a body that was neither Earth nor the Sun. Much more recently, beginning in 1892, dozens of far smaller Jovian moons have been detected and have received the names of lovers (or other sexual partners) or daughters of the Roman god Jupiter or his Greek equivalent Zeus. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n\n**Discovery of outer planet moons**\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

The astronomical literature instead simply referred to \"Jupiter I\", \"Jupiter II\", etc., or \"the first satellite of Jupiter\", \"Jupiter's second satellite\", and so on.[44] The names Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto became popular in the mid-20th century,[45] whereas the rest of the moons remained unnamed and were usually numbered in Roman numerals V (5) to XII (12).[46][47] Jupiter V was discovered in 1892 and given the name *Amalthea* by a popular though unofficial convention, a name first used by French astronomer Camille Flammarion.[48][49]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)A montage of Jupiter and its four largest moons (distance and sizes not to scale)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNames ending with \"a\" or \"o\" are used for prograde irregular satellites (the latter for highly inclined satellites), and names ending with \"e\" are used for retrograde irregulars.[26] With the discovery of smaller, kilometre-sized moons around Jupiter, the IAU has established an additional convention to limit the naming of small moons with absolute magnitudes greater than 18 or diameters smaller than 1 km (0.6 mi).[52] Some of the most recently confirmed moons have not received names.[4]\n\n\nSome asteroids share the same names as moons of Jupiter: 9 Metis, 38 Leda, 52 Europa, 85 Io, 113 Amalthea, 239 Adrastea. Two more asteroids previously shared the names of Jovian moons until spelling differences were made permanent by the IAU: Ganymede and asteroid 1036 Ganymed; and Callisto and asteroid 204 Kallisto.\n\n\n\n## Groups[edit]\n\n\n### Regular satellites[edit]\n\n\nThese have prograde and nearly circular orbits of low inclination and are split into two groups:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)The Galilean moons. From left to right, in order of increasing distance from Jupiter: Io; Europa; Ganymede; Callisto.\nThe physical and orbital characteristics of the moons vary widely. The four Galileans are all over 3,100 kilometres (1,900 mi) in diameter; the largest Galilean, Ganymede, is the ninth largest object in the Solar System, after the Sun and seven of the planets, Ganymede being larger than Mercury. All other Jovian moons are less than 250 kilometres (160 mi) in diameter, with most barely exceeding 5 kilometres (3.1 mi).[note 2] Their orbital shapes range from nearly perfectly circular to highly eccentric and inclined, and many revolve in the direction opposite to Jupiter's rotation (retrograde motion). Orbital periods range from seven hours (taking less time than Jupiter does to rotate around its axis), to almost three Earth years.\n\n\n\n## Origin and evolution[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)The relative masses of the Jovian moons. Those smaller than Europa are not visible at this scale, and combined would only be visible at 100× magnification.\nJupiter's regular satellites are believed to have formed from a circumplanetary disk, a ring of accreting gas and solid debris analogous to a protoplanetary disk.[6][7] They may be the remnants of a score of Galilean-mass satellites that formed early in Jupiter's history.[6][8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* ***Inner satellites*** or ***Amalthea group***: Metis, Adrastea, Amalthea, and Thebe. These orbit very close to Jupiter; the innermost two orbit in less than a Jovian day. The latter two are respectively the fifth and seventh largest moons in the Jovian system. Observations suggest that at least the largest member, Amalthea, did not form on its present orbit, but farther from the planet, or that it is a captured Solar System body.[53] These moons, along with a number of seen and as-yet-unseen inner moonlets (see Amalthea moonlets), replenish and maintain Jupiter's faint ring system. Metis and Adrastea help to maintain Jupiter's main ring, whereas Amalthea and Thebe each maintain their own faint outer rings.[54][55]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNatural satellites of the planet Jupiter\n\nFor other uses, see Moons of Jupiter (disambiguation).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** \"Planetary Satellite Discovery Circumstances\". *JPL Solar System Dynamics*.

Saturn's largest moon, Titan, was discovered in 1655 by Christiaan Huygens using a 57-millimeter (2.2 in) objective lens[12] on a refracting telescope of his own design.[13] Tethys, Dione, Rhea and Iapetus (the \"Sidera Lodoicea\") were discovered between 1671 and 1684 by Giovanni Domenico Cassini.[14] Mimas and Enceladus were discovered in 1789 by William Herschel.[14] Hyperion was discovered in 1848 by W.

Instead of colliding, their gravitational interaction causes them to swap orbits every four years.[49]\n\n\n\n\n### Inner large[edit]\n\n\n![A circular part of a grayish surface, which is intersected from the top-left to the bottom-right by four wide sinuous groves.

Ares, the god of war, was known to the Romans as Mars.\n\n\nCompared to the Earth's Moon, the moons Phobos and Deimos are small. Phobos has a diameter of 22.2 km (13.8 mi) and a mass of 1.08×1016 kg, while Deimos measures 12.6 km (7.8 mi) across, with a mass of 2.0×1015 kg. Phobos orbits closer to Mars, with a semi-major axis of 9,377 km (5,827 mi) and an orbital period of 7.66 hours; while Deimos orbits farther with a semi-major axis of 23,460 km (14,580 mi) and an orbital period of 30.35 hours.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_wmMeH6XNrCFTE05kMHtLUFK0","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

The most massive of the moons are the four Galilean moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto, which were independently discovered in 1610 by Galileo Galilei and Simon Marius and were the first objects found to orbit a body that was neither Earth nor the Sun. Much more recently, beginning in 1892, dozens of far smaller Jovian moons have been detected and have received the names of lovers (or other sexual partners) or daughters of the Roman god Jupiter or his Greek equivalent Zeus. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n\n**Discovery of outer planet moons**\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

The astronomical literature instead simply referred to \"Jupiter I\", \"Jupiter II\", etc., or \"the first satellite of Jupiter\", \"Jupiter's second satellite\", and so on.[44] The names Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto became popular in the mid-20th century,[45] whereas the rest of the moons remained unnamed and were usually numbered in Roman numerals V (5) to XII (12).[46][47] Jupiter V was discovered in 1892 and given the name *Amalthea* by a popular though unofficial convention, a name first used by French astronomer Camille Flammarion.[48][49]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)A montage of Jupiter and its four largest moons (distance and sizes not to scale)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNames ending with \"a\" or \"o\" are used for prograde irregular satellites (the latter for highly inclined satellites), and names ending with \"e\" are used for retrograde irregulars.[26] With the discovery of smaller, kilometre-sized moons around Jupiter, the IAU has established an additional convention to limit the naming of small moons with absolute magnitudes greater than 18 or diameters smaller than 1 km (0.6 mi).[52] Some of the most recently confirmed moons have not received names.[4]\n\n\nSome asteroids share the same names as moons of Jupiter: 9 Metis, 38 Leda, 52 Europa, 85 Io, 113 Amalthea, 239 Adrastea. Two more asteroids previously shared the names of Jovian moons until spelling differences were made permanent by the IAU: Ganymede and asteroid 1036 Ganymed; and Callisto and asteroid 204 Kallisto.\n\n\n\n## Groups[edit]\n\n\n### Regular satellites[edit]\n\n\nThese have prograde and nearly circular orbits of low inclination and are split into two groups:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)The Galilean moons. From left to right, in order of increasing distance from Jupiter: Io; Europa; Ganymede; Callisto.\nThe physical and orbital characteristics of the moons vary widely. The four Galileans are all over 3,100 kilometres (1,900 mi) in diameter; the largest Galilean, Ganymede, is the ninth largest object in the Solar System, after the Sun and seven of the planets, Ganymede being larger than Mercury. All other Jovian moons are less than 250 kilometres (160 mi) in diameter, with most barely exceeding 5 kilometres (3.1 mi).[note 2] Their orbital shapes range from nearly perfectly circular to highly eccentric and inclined, and many revolve in the direction opposite to Jupiter's rotation (retrograde motion). Orbital periods range from seven hours (taking less time than Jupiter does to rotate around its axis), to almost three Earth years.\n\n\n\n## Origin and evolution[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)The relative masses of the Jovian moons. Those smaller than Europa are not visible at this scale, and combined would only be visible at 100× magnification.\nJupiter's regular satellites are believed to have formed from a circumplanetary disk, a ring of accreting gas and solid debris analogous to a protoplanetary disk.[6][7] They may be the remnants of a score of Galilean-mass satellites that formed early in Jupiter's history.[6][8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* ***Inner satellites*** or ***Amalthea group***: Metis, Adrastea, Amalthea, and Thebe. These orbit very close to Jupiter; the innermost two orbit in less than a Jovian day. The latter two are respectively the fifth and seventh largest moons in the Jovian system. Observations suggest that at least the largest member, Amalthea, did not form on its present orbit, but farther from the planet, or that it is a captured Solar System body.[53] These moons, along with a number of seen and as-yet-unseen inner moonlets (see Amalthea moonlets), replenish and maintain Jupiter's faint ring system. Metis and Adrastea help to maintain Jupiter's main ring, whereas Amalthea and Thebe each maintain their own faint outer rings.[54][55]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNatural satellites of the planet Jupiter\n\nFor other uses, see Moons of Jupiter (disambiguation).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** \"Planetary Satellite Discovery Circumstances\". *JPL Solar System Dynamics*.

Absolute magnitudes of irregular satellites were taken from the Minor Planet Center's Natural Satellites Ephemeris Service.[84] Calculations were made with NASA/JPL's Asteroid Size Estimator.[85]\n7. **^**  The diameters and dimensions of the small inner moons, from Pan to Helene, are taken from Thomas et al., 2020, Table 1.[86] Diameters and dimensions of Mimas, Enceladus, Tethys, Dione, Rhea, Iapetus, and Phoebe are from Thomas 2010, Table 1.[40] Diameters of Siarnaq and Albiorix are from Grav et al., 2015, Table 3.[81] The approximate sizes of all other irregular satellites are calculated from their absolute magnitudes with an assumed geometric albedo of 0.04,[85] which is the average value for that population.[81]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n2. **^**  The mass of the rings is about the mass of Mimas,[9] whereas the combined mass of Janus, Hyperion and Phoebe—the most massive of the remaining moons—is about one-third of that. The total mass of the rings and small moons is around 5.5×1019 kg.\n3. **^**  Inktomi was once known as \"The Splat\".[63]\n4. **^**  The photometric color may be used as a proxy for the chemical composition of satellites' surfaces.\n5. **^**  A confirmed moon is given a permanent designation by the IAU consisting of a name and a Roman numeral.[38] The eight moons that were known before 1850 are numbered in order of their distance from Saturn; the rest are numbered in the order by which they received their permanent designations. Many small moons have not yet received a permanent designation.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n36. **^** O'Callaghan, Jonathan (12 May 2023). \"With 62 Newly Discovered Moons, Saturn Knocks Jupiter Off Its Pedestal - If all the objects are recognized by scientific authorities, the ringed giant world will have 145 moons in its orbit\". *The New York Times*.

It has an angular diameter of between 8' (rising) and 12' (overhead). Due to its close orbit, it would look smaller when the observer is further away from the Martian equator and is below the horizon and thus not visible from Mars's polar ice caps. Deimos looks more like a bright star or planet for an observer on Mars, only slightly bigger than Venus looks from Earth; it has an angular diameter of about 2'. The Sun's angular diameter as seen from Mars, by contrast, is about 21'. Thus there are no total solar eclipses on Mars, as the moons are far too small to completely cover the Sun. On the other hand, total lunar eclipses of Phobos happen almost every night.[25]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n6. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Close Inspection for Phobos\".

The most massive of the moons are the four Galilean moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto, which were independently discovered in 1610 by Galileo Galilei and Simon Marius and were the first objects found to orbit a body that was neither Earth nor the Sun. Much more recently, beginning in 1892, dozens of far smaller Jovian moons have been detected and have received the names of lovers (or other sexual partners) or daughters of the Roman god Jupiter or his Greek equivalent Zeus. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n\n**Discovery of outer planet moons**\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

The astronomical literature instead simply referred to \"Jupiter I\", \"Jupiter II\", etc., or \"the first satellite of Jupiter\", \"Jupiter's second satellite\", and so on.[44] The names Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto became popular in the mid-20th century,[45] whereas the rest of the moons remained unnamed and were usually numbered in Roman numerals V (5) to XII (12).[46][47] Jupiter V was discovered in 1892 and given the name *Amalthea* by a popular though unofficial convention, a name first used by French astronomer Camille Flammarion.[48][49]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)A montage of Jupiter and its four largest moons (distance and sizes not to scale)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNames ending with \"a\" or \"o\" are used for prograde irregular satellites (the latter for highly inclined satellites), and names ending with \"e\" are used for retrograde irregulars.[26] With the discovery of smaller, kilometre-sized moons around Jupiter, the IAU has established an additional convention to limit the naming of small moons with absolute magnitudes greater than 18 or diameters smaller than 1 km (0.6 mi).[52] Some of the most recently confirmed moons have not received names.[4]\n\n\nSome asteroids share the same names as moons of Jupiter: 9 Metis, 38 Leda, 52 Europa, 85 Io, 113 Amalthea, 239 Adrastea. Two more asteroids previously shared the names of Jovian moons until spelling differences were made permanent by the IAU: Ganymede and asteroid 1036 Ganymed; and Callisto and asteroid 204 Kallisto.\n\n\n\n## Groups[edit]\n\n\n### Regular satellites[edit]\n\n\nThese have prograde and nearly circular orbits of low inclination and are split into two groups:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)The Galilean moons. From left to right, in order of increasing distance from Jupiter: Io; Europa; Ganymede; Callisto.\nThe physical and orbital characteristics of the moons vary widely. The four Galileans are all over 3,100 kilometres (1,900 mi) in diameter; the largest Galilean, Ganymede, is the ninth largest object in the Solar System, after the Sun and seven of the planets, Ganymede being larger than Mercury. All other Jovian moons are less than 250 kilometres (160 mi) in diameter, with most barely exceeding 5 kilometres (3.1 mi).[note 2] Their orbital shapes range from nearly perfectly circular to highly eccentric and inclined, and many revolve in the direction opposite to Jupiter's rotation (retrograde motion). Orbital periods range from seven hours (taking less time than Jupiter does to rotate around its axis), to almost three Earth years.\n\n\n\n## Origin and evolution[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)The relative masses of the Jovian moons. Those smaller than Europa are not visible at this scale, and combined would only be visible at 100× magnification.\nJupiter's regular satellites are believed to have formed from a circumplanetary disk, a ring of accreting gas and solid debris analogous to a protoplanetary disk.[6][7] They may be the remnants of a score of Galilean-mass satellites that formed early in Jupiter's history.[6][8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* ***Inner satellites*** or ***Amalthea group***: Metis, Adrastea, Amalthea, and Thebe. These orbit very close to Jupiter; the innermost two orbit in less than a Jovian day. The latter two are respectively the fifth and seventh largest moons in the Jovian system. Observations suggest that at least the largest member, Amalthea, did not form on its present orbit, but farther from the planet, or that it is a captured Solar System body.[53] These moons, along with a number of seen and as-yet-unseen inner moonlets (see Amalthea moonlets), replenish and maintain Jupiter's faint ring system. Metis and Adrastea help to maintain Jupiter's main ring, whereas Amalthea and Thebe each maintain their own faint outer rings.[54][55]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNatural satellites of the planet Jupiter\n\nFor other uses, see Moons of Jupiter (disambiguation).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** \"Planetary Satellite Discovery Circumstances\". *JPL Solar System Dynamics*.

Saturn's largest moon, Titan, was discovered in 1655 by Christiaan Huygens using a 57-millimeter (2.2 in) objective lens[12] on a refracting telescope of his own design.[13] Tethys, Dione, Rhea and Iapetus (the \"Sidera Lodoicea\") were discovered between 1671 and 1684 by Giovanni Domenico Cassini.[14] Mimas and Enceladus were discovered in 1789 by William Herschel.[14] Hyperion was discovered in 1848 by W.

Instead of colliding, their gravitational interaction causes them to swap orbits every four years.[49]\n\n\n\n\n### Inner large[edit]\n\n\n![A circular part of a grayish surface, which is intersected from the top-left to the bottom-right by four wide sinuous groves.

Absolute magnitudes of irregular satellites were taken from the Minor Planet Center's Natural Satellites Ephemeris Service.[84] Calculations were made with NASA/JPL's Asteroid Size Estimator.[85]\n7. **^**  The diameters and dimensions of the small inner moons, from Pan to Helene, are taken from Thomas et al., 2020, Table 1.[86] Diameters and dimensions of Mimas, Enceladus, Tethys, Dione, Rhea, Iapetus, and Phoebe are from Thomas 2010, Table 1.[40] Diameters of Siarnaq and Albiorix are from Grav et al., 2015, Table 3.[81] The approximate sizes of all other irregular satellites are calculated from their absolute magnitudes with an assumed geometric albedo of 0.04,[85] which is the average value for that population.[81]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n2. **^**  The mass of the rings is about the mass of Mimas,[9] whereas the combined mass of Janus, Hyperion and Phoebe—the most massive of the remaining moons—is about one-third of that.
