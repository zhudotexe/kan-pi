Drew is a Christian.[27]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDuring his college career, Drew broke 17 school and conference records.[3][4]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### 1997: Drafted by the Philadelphia Phillies[edit]\n\n\nThe Philadelphia Phillies made Drew the second overall pick, after pitcher Matt Anderson, in the 1997 MLB draft. Drew and his agent Scott Boras chose not to sign with the Phillies, insisting Drew would not sign for less than $10 million. The Phillies had no plan to pay an unproven player this amount of money, and despite Boras' warnings, drafted Drew nonetheless. They offered him $2.6 million.[5] Consequently, Drew ended up playing for the St. Paul Saints of the independent Northern League. Boras had Drew sign with an independent baseball league because of a loophole in the rules of the MLB draft.[6]\n\n\n\n### 1998\u20132003: St. Louis Cardinals[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n10. **^** Waggoner, Jim (January 29, 2009). \"Marquis looking ahead to baseball season with Colorado Rockies\". *Staten Island Advance*.

Roughly halfway through the 2005 season, Drew's season was again cut short after being hit on the wrist by a pitch from Arizona Diamondbacks' pitcher Brad Halsey.\n\n\nOn September 18, 2006, Drew was part of only the (then) fourth-ever set of back-to-back-to-back-to-back home runs with fellow Dodgers Jeff Kent, Russell Martin, and Marlon Anderson.[13]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn his book *Three Nights in August*, Buzz Bissinger mentions former manager Tony La Russa's frustration with Drew's lack of passion. La Russa tells Bissinger that it seems Drew had decided to \"settle for 75%\" of his talent, in large part because of his enormous contract.[9]\n\n\n\n### 2004: Atlanta Braves[edit]\n\n\nOn December 13, 2003, Drew was traded to the Atlanta Braves along with catcher Eli Marrero for starting pitcher Jason Marquis, relief pitcher Ray King, and rookie prospect Adam Wainwright.[10][11] There, he had the best season of his career while finally managing to stay healthy. In 2004, he displayed excellent power, patience, and defense, hitting .305 with 31 home runs, 118 walks, and 93 RBI, finishing sixth in the MVP voting.\n\n\n\n![](image)Drew in 2002\n### 2005\u20132006: Los Angeles Dodgers[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| J.

In an attempt to confuse the Philadelphia fans, he did not wear his own jersey that night, which instead was worn by bullpen catcher, Jeff Murphy. The attempt failed, however, and he was booed and heckled throughout batting practice. The only time he received cheers was when he booted three consecutive grounders in the outfield while his teammates were taking batting practice.[7] On August 10, 1999, in Drew's first game at Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia, he was booed loudly, and even had batteries thrown at him by two fans. The Phillie Phanatic got into the act, dropping two large trash bags marked with dollar signs in the outfield between innings.[8] Drew struggled to stay healthy, landing on the disabled list every season he played in St. Louis.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2006, Drew exercised his contract opt-out clause, forgoing $33 million over the next three years to become a free agent. Dodgers general manager Ned Colletti said in a teleconference that he was \"surprised how it came down. Everything we had heard, everything that had been written led us to believe the player loved being here.\"[14][15] This was especially a surprise because a few days before, Drew had told an *LA Times* columnist on how happy he was in LA and that he was looking forward to the upcoming 2007 season. Drew had a very good season, batting .284 with 20 home runs and 100 RBI.\n\n\n\n### 2007\u20132011: Boston Red Sox[edit]\n\n\nOn January 26, 2007, Drew officially signed a five-year contract with the Red Sox worth $70 million. Drew's revised contract had a clause that allowed the Red Sox to opt out of Drew's five-year contract after three or four years if Drew has extensive injuries due to a previously existing problem in his right shoulder.[16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n## Career statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Years\n | Games\n | PA | AB | R | H | 2B | 3B | HR | RBI | SB | BB | SO | AVG | OBP | SLG | FLD% |\n| 14\n | 1566\n | 6153\n | 5173\n | 944\n | 1437\n | 273\n | 48\n | 242\n | 795\n | 87\n | 862\n | 1137\n | .278\n | .384\n | .489\n | .983\n |\n\n\nIn 55 postseason games, Drew hit .261 (48-for-184) with 19 runs, six doubles, seven home runs, 25 RBI and 18 walks.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of Major League Baseball career home run leaders\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDrew graduated from Lowndes County High School in Valdosta, Georgia in 1994.[1] He was drafted by the San Francisco Giants in the 20th round of the 1994 draft but did not sign.[2] He then attended Florida State University, where he played under head coach Mike Martin. At Florida State, he was the winner of the 1997 Dick Howser Trophy and the 1997 Golden Spikes Award, was named the 1997 Collegiate Baseball Player of the Year, the 1997 Sporting News Player of the Year, and was a consensus All-American (1997). He also was named the 1997 ACC Player of the Year. He was a 1996 member of Team USA. Drew was First Team in 1996, Freshman All-American in 1995 and was named to the College World Series All Tournament Team in 1995. He was the first player in college baseball history to hit 30 home runs and steal 30 bases in the same season. He set a Florida State record by batting .455 in 1997 while becoming one of only three players in college baseball history to have 100 hits, 100 runs and 100 RBIs. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDrew was again part of a set of four consecutive home runs on April 22, 2007, in a game against the New York Yankees, this time joining with Manny Ram\u00edrez, Mike Lowell, and Jason Varitek.[17] He is the only player to participate twice in a string of four straight home runs, and he was the second player to go deep in each instance. Drew finished the 2007 season with a .270 batting average, 11 home runs, and 64 RBI.[18]\n\n\n\n![](image)Drew celebrating a Red Sox 2008 playoff victory\nOn October 20, 2007, Drew hit a grand slam in Game 6 of the 2007 ALCS with the Red Sox facing elimination.[19] The home run, along with brother Stephen Drew's for the Arizona Diamondbacks, marks the third time that two brothers have both hit home runs in the same postseason.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 2008, Drew hit one of the longest home runs in Fenway Park history. According to the ESPN Home Run Tracker, it was measured at 460 feet. He finished with a .280 average, with an OBP of .408 and a slugging percentage of .519.[18] At the end of June, Drew was named the AL Player of the Month after hitting .337 and hitting 12 home runs while taking over for David Ortiz's three-spot in the lineup while he was on the disabled list.[20] Drew was officially announced as an AL All-Star reserve on July 6. This was Drew's first All-Star game appearance. He hit a two-run homer in his first at-bat as an All-Star en route to winning the game's MVP award. In what was to become the longest All-Star Game time-wise in MLB history, the American League (and Drew's Red Sox) manager Terry Francona, having almost run out of pitchers, contemplated putting Drew, a former high school hurler, on the mound to close the game. \"I'd have been ready,\" Drew said. \"I've had an opportunity to throw a lot in the outfield. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nSt. Louis Cardinals first-round draft picks\n |\n| --- |\n| * 1965: DiFabio\n* 1966: Lee\n* 1967: Simmons\n* 1968: Hairston\n* 1969: Minott\n* 1970: Browning\n* 1971: Kurpiel\n* 1972: Larson\n* 1973: Edelen\n* 1974: Templeton\n* 1975: Johnson\n* 1976: Durham\n* 1977: T.

The Game 5 comeback, sparked by Drew, is the second-biggest in postseason history and is the largest for a team on the brink of elimination.[24] However, the Red Sox lost to the Rays in the seventh game.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nPhiladelphia Phillies first-round draft picks\n |\n| --- |\n| * 1965: Adamson\n* 1966: Biko\n* 1967: Meyer\n* 1968: Luzinski\n* 1969: Anderson\n* 1970: Martin\n* 1971: Thomas\n* 1972: Christenson\n* 1973: Stearns\n* 1974: L.
