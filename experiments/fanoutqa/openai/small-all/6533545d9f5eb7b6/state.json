With over 20.1 million people in its metropolitan statistical area and 23.5 million in its combined statistical area as of 2020, New York City is one of the world's most populous megacities.[20] The city and its metropolitan area are the premier gateway for legal immigration to the United States. As many as 800 languages are spoken in New York,[21] making it the most linguistically diverse city in the world. New York City enforces a right-to-shelter law guaranteeing shelter to anyone who needs shelter, regardless of their immigration status;[22] and the city is home to more than 3.2 million residents born outside the U.S., the largest foreign-born population of any city in the world as of 2016.[23] It is the most visited U.S. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNew York City is an established safe haven for global investors.[34] As of 2023[update], New York City is the most expensive city in the world for expatriates to live.[35] New York City is home to the highest number of billionaires,[36][37] individuals of ultra-high net worth (greater than US$30 million),[38] and millionaires of any city in the world.[39] Many districts and monuments in New York City are major landmarks, including three of the world's ten-most-visited tourist attractions in 2023.[40] A record 66.6\u00a0million tourists visited New York City in 2019. Times Square is the brightly illuminated hub of the Broadway Theater District,[41] one of the world's busiest pedestrian intersections,[42] and a major center of the world's entertainment industry.[43] Many of the city's landmarks, skyscrapers, and parks are known around the world, and the city's fast pace led to the phrase *New York minute*. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNew York City comprises about 44% of the state's population,[219] and about 39% of the population of the New York metropolitan area.[220] The majority of New York City residents in 2020 (5,141,538, or 58.4%) were living on Long Island, in Brooklyn, or in Queens.[221] As many as 800 languages are spoken in New York,[21][222][223][224] and the New York City metropolitan statistical area has the largest foreign-born population of any metropolitan region in the world. The New York region continues to be by far the leading metropolitan gateway for legal immigrants admitted into the United States, substantially exceeding the combined totals of Los Angeles and Miami.[225]\n\n\n\n### Race and ethnicity[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Race and ethnicity in New York City and New York City ethnic enclaves\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNew York City became the most populous urbanized area in the world in the early 1920s, overtaking London. The metropolitan area surpassed the 10\u00a0million mark in the early 1930s, becoming the first megacity in human history.[118] The Great Depression saw the election of reformer Fiorello La Guardia as mayor and the fall of Tammany Hall after eighty years of political dominance.[119]\n\n\nReturning World War II veterans created a post-war economic boom and the development of large housing tracts in eastern Queens and Nassau County. New York emerged from the war unscathed as the leading city of the world, with Wall Street leading America's place as the world's dominant economic power. The United Nations headquarters was completed in 1952, solidifying New York's global geopolitical influence, and the rise of abstract expressionism in the city precipitated New York's displacement of Paris as the center of the art world.[120]\n\n\n\n### Late 20th and 21st centuries[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNew York contains the highest total Asian population of any U.S. city proper.[235] Asian Americans in New York City, according to the 2010 census, number more than one million, greater than the combined totals of San Francisco and Los Angeles.[236] New York has the largest Chinese population of any city outside Asia,[237] Manhattan's Chinatown is the highest concentration of Chinese people in the Western Hemisphere,[238] and Queens is home to the largest Tibetan population outside Asia.[239] Arab Americans number over 160,000 in New York City,[240] with the highest concentration in Brooklyn. Central Asians, primarily Uzbek Americans, are a rapidly growing segment of the city's non-Hispanic White population.[241] The metropolitan area is home to 20% of the nation's Indian Americans and at least 20 Little India enclaves, and 15% of all Korean Americans and four Koreatowns.[242]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n216. **^** United States -- Places and (in selected states) County Subdivisions with 50,000 or More Population; and for Puerto Rico Archived June 8, 2011, at the Wayback Machine, United States Census Bureau United States Census, 2000.
