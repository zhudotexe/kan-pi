The name was changed to Liangjiang Normal College (\u5169\u6c5f\u5e2b\u7bc4\u5b78\u5802) in 1906, and the new president Li Ruiqing. established the first faculty of modern art in China.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1915 after the Republic of China replaced Qing dynasty, the Nanking Higher Normal School (\u5357\u4eac\u9ad8\u7b49\u5e2b\u7bc4\u5b78\u6821) was founded to replace Liangjiang Higher Normal School which was closed three years before due to Xinhai Revolution, Jiang Qian was appointed as the president.[Note 2] The school established the China's first faculty of modern gymnastics (physical education) in 1916.

Numerous Chinese modern science pioneers, most of whom studied in America and some European countries such as Britain, France, and Germany, converged there to found many fields of science in China. It became the Chinese cradle of modern science. Among 81 academicians of \"Academia Sinica\" elected for the first time in 1948, five entered or graduated from the university in 1920.

Since it was founded in CE 258, it had evolved and adopted different names in each dynasty or period in ancient China. It became a modern institution of higher learning in 1902 during Qing dynasty. Liangjiang Higher Normal School was closed in 1911 when the Qing dynasty was overthrown. In 1915 after the Republic of China was founded, Nanking Higher Normal School was established to replace the Liangjing Normal School. In 1949 when the Republic of China was replaced by the People's Republic of China in mainland, its name was changed from National Central University (\u56fd\u7acb\u4e2d\u592e\u5927\u5b66) to Nanjing University (\u5357\u4eac\u5927\u5b66).\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDuring the Anti-Japanese War between 1937 and 1945, the university moved to Chongqing, while the College of Medicine and Department of Animal Husbandry & Veterinary Medicine of College of Agriculture moved to Chengdu.

China Association of Scientific Workers (\u4e2d\u570b\u79d1\u5b78\u5de5\u4f5c\u8005\u5354\u6703) was founded in the university in 1944.[Note 4] China Science Society and the associations were merged to be the China Association for Science and Technology in 1958 in Beijing. The Natural Science Forum was initiated by the university faculties in 1939, which was later renamed Jiusan Forum (Sept. 3rd Forum) and became Jiusan Society in 1945, an organization for intellectual groups in China. In the united college entrance examinations beginning in 1937, about two-thirds of students put the university as the first choice. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nProject 985\n |\n| --- |\n| **Higher education and universities in China**\n |\n| Beijing (8) | * Beihang\n* China Agricultural\n* China Minzu\n* Normal\n* Peking\n* Renmin\n* Beijing Technology\n* Tsinghua\n |\n| Tianjin (2) | * Nankai\n* Tianjin\n |\n| Heilongjiang (1) | * Harbin Technology\n |\n| Jilin (1) | * Jilin\n |\n| Liaoning (2) | * Dalian Technology\n* Northeastern\n |\n| Shanghai (4) | * East China Normal\n* Fudan\n* Shanghai Jiaotong\n* Tongji\n |\n| Jiangsu (2) | * Nanjing\n* Southeast\n |\n| Zhejiang (1) | * Zhejiang\n |\n| Anhui (1) | * China Science and Technology\n |\n| Fujian (1) | * Xiamen\n |\n| Shandong (2) | * Shandong\n* China Ocean\n |\n| Shaanxi (3) | * Northwest A&F\n* Northwestern Poly\n* Xi'an Jiaotong\n |\n| Hubei (2) | * Huazhong Science and Technology\n* Wuhan\n |\n| Hunan (3) | * Central South\n* National Defense Technology\n* Hunan\n |\n| Guangdong (2) | * South China Technology\n* Sun Yat-sen\n |\n| Chongqing (1) | * Chongqing\n |\n| Sichuan (2) | * Sichuan\n* Electronic Science and Technology\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n2. **^** Jiang Qian was appointed as the president of Nanking Higher Normal School in July 1914, to establish the school in the campus of the closed Liangjiang Higher Normal School, and the charger of keeping of Liangjiang Higher Normal School became a member of the preparatory committee of Nanking Higher Normal School.
