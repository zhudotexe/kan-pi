Sequences removed from the final film had Spider-Man protecting Maximilian Fargas, the wheelchair-using Oscorp executive, from the Goblin, and Spider-Man defusing a hostage situation on a train.[60] As production neared, Ziskin hired award-winning writer Alvin Sargent, to polish the dialogue, primarily between Parker and Mary Jane.[73] Columbia gave the Writers Guild of America a list of four writers as contributors to the final *Spider-Man* script: Rosenberg, Sargent and James Cameron, all three of whom voluntarily relinquished credit to the fourth, Koepp.[66]\n\n\n\n### Casting[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n22. **^** Lawrence, Gregory (July 11, 2020). \"Tig Notaro on 'Under a Rock', 'Star Trek: Discovery', and Auditioning for 'Spider-Man'\". *Collider*.
