It includes sovereign states, inhabited dependent territories and, in some cases, constituent countries of sovereign states, with inclusion within the list being primarily based on the ISO standard ISO 3166-1. For instance, the United Kingdom is considered a single entity, while the constituent countries of the Kingdom of the Netherlands are considered separately. In addition, this list includes certain states with limited recognition not found in ISO 3166-1. Also given in a percentage is each country's population compared with the world population, which the United Nations estimates at 8.11 billion as of 2023[update].[1]\n\n\n\n\n##

While it is often identified with the Sarasvati River,[2] this is not a consensus view.[3] The **Hakra** is the dried-out channel of a river in Pakistan that is the continuation of the Ghaggar River in India. Several times, but not continuously, it carried the water of the Sutlej during the Bronze Age period [4] Many settlements of the Indus Valley civilisation have been found along the Ghaggar and Hakra rivers.\n* **Saraswati River**: Also known as Sarasvati River. This river was one of the major rivers of Ancient India which no longer exists.\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Introduction to Pakistan: Section 4: Rivers\". *www.wildlifeofpakistan.com*.\n2. **^** Oldham, R.
