ARKive (6 August 2004)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe **largest animal** currently alive is the blue whale. The maximum recorded weight was 190 tonnes for a specimen measuring 27.6 metres (91 ft), whereas longer ones, up to 33.6 metres (110 ft), have been recorded but not weighed.[1][2][3] It is estimated, this individual could have a mass of 250 tonnes.[4][5] The longest non-colonial animal is the lion's mane jellyfish (36.6m / 120 ft).[6]\n\n\nIn 2023, paleontologists estimated that the extinct whale *Perucetus*, discovered in Peru, may have outweighed the blue whale, with a mass of 85-340 t (84-335 long tons; 94-375 short tonnes.)[7] While controversial, estimates for the weight of the sauropod *Bruhathkayosaurus* suggest it was around 110-170 tons, with the highest estimate being 240 tons, if scaled with *Patagotitan*, although actual fossil remains no longer exist, and that estimation is based on described dimensions in 1987.[8] The upper estimates of weight for these two prehistoric animals would have easily rivaled or exceeded the blue whale. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe largest land mammal extant today is the African bush elephant. The largest extinct land mammal known was long considered to be *Paraceratherium orgosensis*, a rhinoceros relative thought to have stood up to 4.8 m (15.7 ft) tall, measured over 7.4 m (24.3 ft) long and may have weighed about 17 tonnes.[55][56] In 2015, a study suggested that one example of the proboscidean *Palaeoloxodon namadicus* may have been the largest land mammal ever, based on extensive research of fragmentary leg bone fossils from one individual, with a maximum estimated size of 22 tonnes.[57][55]\n\n\n\n### Stem-mammals (Synapsida)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Rank\n | Animal\n | Average mass[kg (lb)]\n | Maximum mass[kg (lb)]\n | Average total length[m (ft)]\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Saltwater crocodile | 450 (1,000)[77][78] | 2,000 (4,400)[79][80] | 4.5 (14.8)[77][81] |\n| 2 | Nile crocodile | 410 (900)[82] | 1,090 (2,400)[1] | 4.2 (13.8)[82] |\n| 3 | Orinoco crocodile | 380 (840)[*citation needed*] | 1,100 (2,400)[*citation needed*] | 4.1 (13.5)[83][84] |\n| 4 | Leatherback sea turtle | 364 (800)[85][86] | 932 (2,050)[1] | 2.0 (6.6)[1] |\n| 5 | American crocodile | 336 (740)[87] | 1,000 (2,200)[88] | 4.0 (13.1)[89][90] |\n| 6 | Black caiman | 300 (661)[*citation needed*] | 1,000 (2,200)[*citation needed*] | 3.9 (12.8)[91][92][93][94] |\n| 7 | Gharial | 250 (550)[95] | 1,000 (2,200)[96] | 4.5 (14.8)[95] |\n| 8 | American alligator | 240 (530)[97][98] | 1,000 (2,200)[1] | 3.4 (11.2)[98] |\n| 9 | Mugger crocodile | 225 (495)[97] | 700 (1,500)[99] | 3.3 (10.8)[98] |\n| 10 | False gharial | 210 (460)[100] | 590 (1,300)[101] | 4.0 (13.1)[102] |\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_pdINY1vBrJTrU35hi5DclVnH","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
