The combined population of both China and India are estimated to be over 2.8 billion people as of 2022[update].\nAsia's population is projected to grow to 5.25 billion by 2055, or about 54% of projected world population at that time.[1] Population growth in Asia was close to 0.55% p.a. as of 2022[update], with highly disparate rates. Many Western Asian and South Asian countries have growth rates above world average, notably Pakistan at 2% p.a., while China had a small decrease of -0.06% and India had a 0.6% increase in 2022. \n\n\n\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Asian countries by population and List of Asian countries by life expectancy\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n#### Shares of World Population, Asia, 1\u20131998 A.D.

They are distributed as to form a \"hollow continent\" with most of the population concentrated around the margins of the continent.[70] On one hand, there are several sparsely populated areas such as tropical forests, the Atacama Desert and the icy portions of Patagonia. On the other hand, the continent presents regions of high population density, such as the great urban centers. The population is formed by descendants of Europeans (mainly Spaniards, Portuguese and Italians), Africans and Amerindians. There is a high percentage of Mestizos that vary greatly in composition by place. There is also a minor population of Asians,[*further explanation needed*] especially in Brazil, Peru, and Argentina. The two main languages are by far Spanish and Portuguese, followed by English, French and Dutch in smaller numbers.\n\n\n\n### Language[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of South America\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | * **Submerged continent/lands and microcontinents**Beringia\n* Cathaysia\n* Doggerland\n* Great Australian Bight\n* Jan Mayen\n* Kerguelen Plateau\n* Madagascar\n* Mauritia\n* Sahul\n* Seychelles\n* Sunda\n* Zealandia\n | * **Possible future supercontinents**Amasia\n* Aurica\n* Novopangaea\n* Pangaea Proxima\n | * **Mythical, lost, and hypothesised continents**Atlantis\n* Hyperborea\n* Kumari Kandam\n* Lemuria\n* Meropis\n* Mu\n* *Terra Australis*\n | * **Subcontinents**Alaska\n* Arabia\n* Central America\n* Eastern Africa\n* Eastern Siberia\n* Greenland\n* Indian Subcontinent\n |\n |\n\n |\n| * See also: **![](image) World portal**\n* Regions of the world\n* Continental fragment\n* ![](image) Category\n* Chronology of continents\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nCountries and dependencies of South America\n |\n| --- |\n| Sovereignstates | \n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
