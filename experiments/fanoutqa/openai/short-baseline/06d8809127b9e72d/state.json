It was found in a remote area of Redwood National Park that was part of the original 1968 park boundaries. The park also houses the second, fourth and fifth tallest known trees, coast redwoods named Helios, Icarus, and Daedalus, currently 377, 371 and 363 feet, respectively.[6][7][8] Hyperion was measured as 116.07 metres (380.8\u00a0ft) tall in 2019.[2]\n\n\nHyperion is estimated to be 600 to 800 years old[2][8][9] and contain 530\u00a0m3 (18,600\u00a0cu\u00a0ft) of wood.[3]\n\n\nThe exact location of Hyperion is nominally secret but is available via internet search.[10] However, In July\u00a02022, the Redwood Park superintendent closed the entire area around the tree, citing \"devastation of the habitat surrounding Hyperion\" caused by visitors, and now anyone who gets too close could face up to six months in jail and a $5,000 fine.[1][11][12]\n\n\nResearchers have said that woodpecker activity at the top may have prevented the tree from growing taller.[9]\n\n\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2012, Hyperion was featured in the BBC Radio 4 documentary, *James and the Giant Redwoods*, by James Aldred.[13]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of superlative trees\n* List of individual trees\n* List of tallest trees\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Should I Hike to Hyperion?\". *Redwood National Park*.

The tree was first measured by climber-deployed tapeline at 99.6 metres (327\u00a0ft) tall in 2008, and was subsequently re-measured to be 100.5 metres (330\u00a0ft) tall by ground laser in 2018.[2][3][1] This discovery places *E. regnans* as the third-tallest tree species in the world after the coast redwood and the Shorea faguetiana, and taller than both the Sitka spruce and Coastal Douglas Fir.[4][5]\nIt was discovered in August 2008 by employees of Forestry Tasmania while analysing the data collected by LiDAR system used in mapping and assessment of state forest resources.[6]\n\n\n\n\n## Condition[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe tree is in a small patch of very old forest surrounded by secondary forest and has survived logging and forest fires by coincidence. Near Centurion grew two other giant trees: the 86.5 metre tall *E. regnans* named Triarius and The Prefect which had a girth of 19m until destroyed in the 2019 fires.[7]\n\n\nIn February 2019 it was damaged from a bushfire that devastated the surrounding area but appears to have initially survived. A new hollow in the base was created by the fire.[8]\n\n\n\n## Height[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of tallest trees\n\nTwo more recent measurements indicated that the tree was growing, albeit very slowly. In January 2014 the tree was climbed and the tape drop indicated the tree had grown to 99.82m. However, a further tape drop done in 2016 obtained the slightly lower height of 99.67m.[9] Centurion was re-measured again by ground laser in December 2018 and was found to have possibly reached 100.5 meters in height.[1]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWorld's tallest Eucalyptus tree in Tasmania, Australia\n\n\n\n| Centurion |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)A photo of Centurion taken in April 2009\n |\n| ![Centurion is located in Tasmania](image)![Centurion](image)\nCenturion\n |\n| Species | **Eucalyptus regnans** |\n| Coordinates | 43\u00b005\u203252\u2033S 146\u00b048\u203208\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff43.097684\u00b0S 146.802085\u00b0E\ufeff / -43.097684; 146.802085 |\n| Height | 100.5\u00a0m (330\u00a0ft)[1] |\n| Diameter | 4.05\u00a0m (13.3\u00a0ft) |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe diameter of Centurion is 4.05 metres, its girth exceeds 12 metres, and its volume has been estimated at 268 cubic metres. The name \"Centurion\" was saved for the hundredth noble tree to be discovered by Forestry Tasmania and coincided with the height of the tree. Named after centurions (Roman officers), the root of the name contains *centum*, which in Latin means \"one hundred\". Centurion is alternately known as \"the Bradman\" as the height of the tree at 99.82 metres was close to the Test run average of the Australian cricketer Donald Bradman.[10]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of individual trees\n* List of tallest trees\n* List of named *Eucalyptus* trees\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Natural | * Coal River Valley\n* Derwent Valley\n* Huon Valley\n* Styx Valley\n* Upper Florentine Valley\n* Weld Valley\n |\n| Man-made | * Buckland Military Training Area\n* Cape Bruny Lighthouse\n* South Coast Track\n* Tahune AirWalk\n |\n\n |\n| Islands | * Boomer\n* Bruny\n* Eddystone\n* Egg\n* Friars\n* Garden\n* Green\n* Hope\n* Images\n* Nuggets\n* Partridge\n* Pedra Branca\n* Picnic\n* Satellite\n |\n| Books and newspapers | * *Tasmania's offshore islands*\n* *The Mercury*\n |\n| Flora, fauna, and fishlife | * Centurion\n* Triarius\n |\n| Bioregions | * South East (bioregion)\n* Southern Ranges (bioregion)\n |\n| Indigenous heritage | * Bruny Island language\n* Truganini\n |\n| Other | * Cygnet Folk Festival\n |\n| * ![](image) **Category**\n |\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

At 88.32 m, it was billed as the tallest tropical tree in the world, until the discovery of an even taller *S. faguetiana*, dubbed Menara, in August 2018.\n |\n| Conservation status\n |\n| ![](image)Endangered \u00a0(IUCN 3.1)[1]\n |\n| Scientific classification ![Edit this classification](image) |\n| Kingdom:\n | Plantae |\n| *Clade*:\n | Tracheophytes |\n| *Clade*:\n | Angiosperms |\n| *Clade*:\n | Eudicots |\n| *Clade*:\n | Rosids |\n| Order:\n | Malvales |\n| Family:\n | Dipterocarpaceae |\n| Genus:\n | *Shorea* |\n| Species:\n | ***S.\u00a0faguetiana***\n |\n| Binomial name |\n| ***Shorea faguetiana***Heim.\n |\n\n\n***Shorea faguetiana*** is a species of plant in the family Dipterocarpaceae. Along with other species in the genus *Shorea*, it is also known as the *Yellow Meranti.* It is native to Borneo, the Malay Peninsula, and Thailand.[1] It is the tallest flowering plant, and third tallest living tree, after the sequoia and Himalayan cypress, with the largest specimen measuring 100.7\u00a0m (330\u00a0ft) in height.[2]\n\n\n\n## Height[edit]\n\n\nThe tallest specimen, named \"Menara\", was measured in 2019.[3][4][5] The tree's height was measured from the top of the crown to the lowest part of the buttress,[2] giving an averaged measurement of 97.58 m.[6]\n\n\nAn almost equally tall *S. faguetiana*, 96.9\u00a0m (318\u00a0ft), was found in 2018 in the Tawau Hills National Park, Sabah, some 24\u00a0km (15\u00a0mi) from Tawau and about 9.5\u00a0km (5.9\u00a0mi) from the park\u2019s main station.[7][8]\n\n\nIn 2016, the then tallest tropical tree, known as \"Lahad Datu\", was found at the Danum Valley Conservation Area. It was measured as an average of tape drops to be 93.0\u00a0m (305.1\u00a0ft) tall and its canopy was 40.3\u00a0m (132\u00a0ft) in diameter.[9][10][11]\n\n\nAlso in 2016, a *Shorea faguetiana* tree 89.5\u00a0m (294\u00a0ft) tall was found in the Maliau Basin Conservation Area in Sabah.[12][13]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* The world's tallest tree species\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Pooma, R.; Newman, M.F.; Barstow, M.
