The vice presidency is exceptional in that the position requires an election to office pursuant to the United States Constitution. The president may also designate heads of other agencies and non-Senate-confirmed members of the Executive Office of the President as Cabinet-level members of the Cabinet. The Cabinet meets with the president in the Cabinet Room, a room adjacent to the Oval Office.\n\n\nThe following have been named as Cabinet appointees by the president of the United States.[9]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | This article is part of a series about\nJoe Biden |\n\n |\n| \n\n---\n\n* Political positions\n* Electoral history\n\n\n\n---\n\n* Early life and career\n* Eponyms\n* Family\n* Honors\n* Public image\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Biden Cabinet\n |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)Cabinet of the United States |\n| 2021\u2013present |\n| ![Joe Biden](image)Cabinet of President Joe Biden in July 2021\n |\n| Date formed | January\u00a020,\u00a02021\u00a0(2021-01-20) |\n| People and organizations |\n| President | Joe Biden |\n| President's history | Former U.S. Vice President(2009\u20132017)Former U.S. Senator from Delaware(1973\u20132009)Former New Castle County Councilman (1971\u20131973) |\n| Vice President | Kamala Harris |\n| Total no. of members | 25 (incl.

The president has the authority to nominate members of his Cabinet to the United States Senate for confirmation under the Appointments Clause of the United States Constitution.\n\n\nBefore confirmation and during congressional hearings, a high-level career member of an executive department heads this pre-confirmed cabinet on an acting basis. The Cabinet's creation was part of the transition of power following the 2020 United States presidential election.\n\n\nIn addition to the 15 heads of executive departments, there are 10 Cabinet-level officials. Biden altered his cabinet structure, elevating the chair of the Council of Economic Advisers,[1] director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy[2] and ambassador to the United Nations as Cabinet-level positions.[3] Biden initially removed the director of the Central Intelligence Agency from his Cabinet, but reversed the move in July 2023.[4][5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  Director, Management and Administration |  Dave Noble |  2022\u2013pres. | Chief of Staff to the First Lady |  Vacant |  2022\u2013pres. |\n|  Director, Scheduling and Advance |  Ryan Montoya |  2021\u2013pres. |  Director, Office of Science and Technology Policy | Arati Prabhakar |  2022\u2013pres. |\n| White House Social Secretary | Carlos Elizondo |  2021\u2013pres. |  Director, Office of Management and Budget | Shalanda Young |  2021\u2013pres. |\n| Chief of Staff to the Vice President | Lorraine Voles |  2022\u2013pres. | United States Trade Representative | Katherine Tai |  2021\u2013pres. |\n| White House Chief Usher |  Robert B.
