The responsibilities of the chief of staff are both managerial and advisory over the president's official business. The chief of staff is appointed by and serves at the pleasure of the president; it does not require Senate confirmation. The first Cabinet or Cabinet-level position appointee announced by Biden was White House chief of staff Ron Klain.[74] He stepped down in February 2023, and he was succeeded by Jeff Zients.[75][76][77]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n77. **^** Anders Hagstrom; Brooke Singman; Greg Wehner (January 22, 2023). \"Biden to tap former COVID czar Jeff Zients as new chief of staff\". *Fox News*.

The president has the authority to nominate members of his Cabinet to the United States Senate for confirmation under the Appointments Clause of the United States Constitution.\n\n\nBefore confirmation and during congressional hearings, a high-level career member of an executive department heads this pre-confirmed cabinet on an acting basis. The Cabinet's creation was part of the transition of power following the 2020 United States presidential election.\n\n\nIn addition to the 15 heads of executive departments, there are 10 Cabinet-level officials. Biden altered his cabinet structure, elevating the chair of the Council of Economic Advisers,[1] director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy[2] and ambassador to the United Nations as Cabinet-level positions.[3] Biden initially removed the director of the Central Intelligence Agency from his Cabinet, but reversed the move in July 2023.[4][5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  Director, Management and Administration |  Dave Noble |  2022–pres. | Chief of Staff to the First Lady |  Vacant |  2022–pres. |\n|  Director, Scheduling and Advance |  Ryan Montoya |  2021–pres. |  Director, Office of Science and Technology Policy | Arati Prabhakar |  2022–pres. |\n| White House Social Secretary | Carlos Elizondo |  2021–pres. |  Director, Office of Management and Budget | Shalanda Young |  2021–pres. |\n| Chief of Staff to the Vice President | Lorraine Voles |  2022–pres. | United States Trade Representative | Katherine Tai |  2021–pres. |\n| White House Chief Usher |  Robert B.
