The regular season began on October 24, 2023, and will end on April 14, 2024.[1] The NBA is currently holding an in-season tournament for the first time from November 3 to December 9, with all games except the final counting toward the regular season standings.[2] The 2024 NBA All-Star Game is scheduled for February 18, 2024, at Gainbridge Fieldhouse in Indianapolis.[3] The play-in tournament is scheduled for April 16\u201319, and the playoffs are set to begin on April 20. The NBA Finals are scheduled to start on June 6, with a possible Game 7 scheduled for June 23.[2]\n\n\n\n\n## Transactions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of 2023\u201324 NBA season transactions\n\n### Retirement[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* To compensate, the NBA's regular season scheduling formula will be modified so only 80 games for each team are initially announced during the offseason. The first two rounds of the in-season tournament would then count as regular season games 81 and 82. The championship game would then be an extra 83rd game that would not count toward the regular season. Teams that do not qualify for the in-season tournament, or are eliminated in the quarterfinals, would then be scheduled additional games against each other that are eliminated in the same conference (if possible) and round to reach 82 games.\n\n\nThe schedule for the in-season tournament was released on August 15, 2023.[33] The additional conclusion games for those teams that do not qualify for the in-season tournament, or are eliminated in the quarterfinals, will be announced at a later date.\n\n\n\n### Standings[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Date\n | Teams\n | Arena\n | Location\n | Reference\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| NBA Mexico City Game 2023\n |\n| November 9\n | Orlando Magic vs. Atlanta Hawks | Mexico City Arena | Mexico City, Mexico\n | [34] |\n| NBA Paris Game 2024\n |\n| January 11\n | Brooklyn Nets vs. Cleveland Cavaliers | Accor Arena | Paris, France\n | [35] |\n\n\n### In-season tournament[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2023 NBA in-season tournament\n\nThe NBA introduced the new NBA in-season tournament for the 2023\u201324 season, with all games except the championship final counting towards the regular-season standings.
