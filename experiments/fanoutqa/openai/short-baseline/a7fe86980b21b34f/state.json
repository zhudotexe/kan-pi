He is considered by many to be the preeminent synthetic organic chemist of the twentieth century,[3] having made many key contributions to the subject, especially in the synthesis of complex natural products and the determination of their molecular structure. He also worked closely with Roald Hoffmann on theoretical studies of chemical reactions. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1965.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nWoodward was born in Boston, Massachusetts, on April 10, 1917. He was the son of Margaret Burns (an immigrant from Scotland who claimed to be a descendant of the poet, Robert Burns) and her husband, Arthur Chester Woodward, himself the son of Roxbury apothecary, Harlow Elliot Woodward. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Todd, L.; Cornforth, J.; T., A.

MIT readmitted him in the 1935 fall term, and by 1936 he had received the Bachelor of Science degree. Only one year later, MIT awarded him the doctorate, when his classmates were still graduating with their bachelor's degrees.[6] Woodward's doctoral work involved investigations related to the synthesis of the female sex hormone estrone.[7] MIT required that graduate students have research advisors. Woodward's advisors were James Flack Norris and Avery Adrian Morton,[*citation needed*] although it is not clear whether he actually took any of their advice. After a short postdoctoral stint at the University of Illinois, he took a Junior Fellowship at Harvard University from 1937 to 1938, and remained at Harvard in various capacities for the rest of his life. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n## External links[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\nWikiquote has quotations related to ***Robert Burns Woodward***.\n\n* Notes from Robert Burns Woodward's Seminars taken by Robert E.

He was also a consultant to many companies such as Polaroid, Pfizer, and Merck. Other awards include:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring his lifetime Woodward authored or coauthored almost 200 publications, of which 85 are full papers, the remainder comprising preliminary communications, the text of lectures, and reviews. The pace of his scientific activity soon outstripped his capacity to publish all experimental details, and much of the work in which he participated was not published until a few years after his death. Woodward trained more than two hundred Ph.D. students and postdoctoral workers, many of whom later went on to distinguished careers.\n\n\nSome of his best-known students include Robert M. Williams (Colorado State), Harry Wasserman (Yale), Yoshito Kishi (Harvard), Stuart Schreiber (Harvard), William R. Roush (Scripps-Florida), Steven A. Benner (UF), James D.

At the time, he was working on the synthesis of an antibiotic, erythromycin. A student of his said about him:[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the 1960s, Woodward was named Donner Professor of Science, a title that freed him from teaching formal courses so that he could devote his entire time to research.\n\n\n\n## Research and career[edit]\n\n\n### Early work[edit]\n\n\nThe first major contribution of Woodward's career in the early 1940s was a series of papers describing the application of ultraviolet spectroscopy in the elucidation of the structure of natural products. Woodward collected together a large amount of empirical data, and then devised a series of rules later called the Woodward's rules, which could be applied to finding out the structures of new natural substances, as well as non-natural synthesized molecules. The expedient use of newly developed instrumental techniques was a characteristic Woodward exemplified throughout his career, and it marked a radical change from the extremely tedious and long chemical methods of structural elucidation that had been used until then.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n5. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** *Remembering organic chemistry legend Robert Burns Woodward Famed chemist would have been 100 this year* By Bethany Halford C&EN Volume 95 Issue 15 | pp. 28-34 Issue Date: April 10, 2017 link.\n6. ^ ***a*** ***b*** The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1965 - Robert B.

The predictions of these rules, called the \"Woodward\u2013Hoffmann rules\" were verified by many experiments. Hoffmann shared the 1981 Nobel Prize for this work along with Kenichi Fukui, a Japanese chemist who had done similar work using a different approach; Woodward had died in 1979 and Nobel Prizes are not awarded posthumously.\n\n\n\n### Woodward Institute[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHis lectures frequently lasted for three or four hours.[5] His longest known lecture defined the unit of time known as the \"Woodward\", after which his other lectures were deemed to be so many \"milli-Woodwards\" long.[23] In many of these, he eschewed the use of slides and drew structures by using multicolored chalk. Typically, to begin a lecture, Woodward would arrive and lay out two large white handkerchiefs on the countertop. Upon one would be four or five colors of chalk (new pieces), neatly sorted by color, in a long row. Upon the other handkerchief would be placed an equally impressive row of cigarettes. The previous cigarette would be used to light the next one. His Thursday seminars at Harvard often lasted well into the night. He had a fixation with blue, and many of his suits, his car, and even his parking space were coloured in blue.[5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFrom a very early age, Woodward was attracted to and engaged in private study of chemistry while he attended a public primary school, and then Quincy High School,[4] in Quincy, Massachusetts. By the time he entered high school, he had already managed to perform most of the experiments in Ludwig Gattermann's then widely used textbook of experimental organic chemistry. In 1928, Woodward contacted the Consul-General of the German consulate in Boston (Baron von Tippelskirch [5]), and through him, managed to obtain copies of a few original papers published in German journals. Later, in his Cope lecture, he recalled how he had been fascinated when, among these papers, he chanced upon Diels and Alder's original communication about the Diels\u2013Alder reaction. Throughout his career, Woodward was to repeatedly and powerfully use and investigate this reaction, both in theoretical and experimental ways. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n*I owe a lot to R. B. Woodward. He showed me that one could attack difficult problems without a clear idea of their outcome, but with confidence that intelligence and effort would solve them. He showed me the beauty of modern organic chemistry, and the relevance to the field of detailed careful reasoning. He showed me that one does not need to specialize. Woodward made great contributions to the strategy of synthesis, to the deduction of difficult structures, to the invention of new chemistry, and to theoretical aspects as well. He taught his students by example the satisfaction that comes from total immersion in our science. I treasure the memory of my association with this remarkable chemist.*\n### Publications[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWoodward showed that organic synthesis could be made into a rational science, and that synthesis could be aided by well-established principles of reactivity and structure. This synthesis was the first one in a series of exceedingly complicated and elegant syntheses that he would undertake.\n\n\n\n### Later work and its impact[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Woodward talked about Chlorophyll in 1965\nCulminating in the 1930s, the British chemists Christopher Ingold and Robert Robinson among others had investigated the mechanisms of organic reactions, and had come up with empirical rules which could predict reactivity of organic molecules. Woodward was perhaps the first synthetic organic chemist who used these ideas as a predictive framework in synthesis. Woodward's style was the inspiration for the work of hundreds of successive synthetic chemists who synthesized medicinally important and structurally complex natural products.\n\n\n\n### Organic syntheses and Nobel Prize[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

But since women were not yet admitted to the Bachelor of Arts degree program, they were excluded from the university's governance structure. Since University of Cambridge students must belong to a college, and since established colleges remained closed to women, women found admissions restricted to few university colleges that had been established only for them. Darwin College, the first graduate college of the university, matriculated both male and female students from its inception in 1964 and elected a mixed fellowship. Undergraduate colleges, starting with Churchill, Clare, and King's Colleges, began admitting women between 1972 and 1988. Among women's colleges at the university, Girton began admitting male students in 1979, and Lucy Cavendish began admitting men in 2021. But the other female-only colleges have remained female-only colleges as of 2023. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n31. **^** Cambridge University Physics Society (1995).
