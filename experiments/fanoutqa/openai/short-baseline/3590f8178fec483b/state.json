On 7 March, two weeks after scoring four goals in a league fixture against Valencia, he scored five times in a Champions League last 16-round match against Bayer Leverkusen, an unprecedented achievement in the history of the competition.[126][127] In addition to being the joint top assist provider with five assists, this feat made him top scorer with 14 goals, tying Jos\u00e9 Altafini's record from the 1962\u201363 season, as well as becoming only the second player after Gerd M\u00fcller to be top scorer in four campaigns.[128][129] Two weeks later, on 20 March, Messi became the top goalscorer in Barcelona's history at 24 years old, overtaking the 57-year record of C\u00e9sar Rodr\u00edguez's 232 goals with a hat-trick against Granada.[130]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAfter a year at Barcelona's youth academy, La Masia, Messi was finally enrolled in the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) in February 2002. Now playing in all competitions, he befriended his teammates, among whom were Cesc F\u00e0bregas and Gerard Piqu\u00e9.[24] After completing his growth hormone treatment aged 14,[25] Messi became an integral part of the \"Baby Dream Team\", Barcelona's greatest-ever youth side. During his first full season (2002\u201303), he was top scorer with 36 goals in 30 games for the *Cadetes* A, who won an unprecedented treble of the league and both the Spanish and Catalan cups.[24][26] The Copa Catalunya final, a 4\u20131 victory over Espanyol, became known in club lore as the *partido de la m\u00e1scara*, the final of the mask. \n</fragment>\n</document>",

As his signing-on bonus, he received a luminous watch and a three-piece suit. Among his teammates at the club was his childhood friend Sagibarba. During holidays at the Catalan resort of Cadaqu\u00e9s, Samitier and Sagibarba had played football with, among others, Salvador Dal\u00ed. He was also friends with the famous Spanish artist Salvador Dal\u00ed.[4]\n\n\n\n### FC Barcelona[edit]\n\n\nBy 1925 Samitier was the highest-paid player in Spain. He was a member of the legendary FC Barcelona team, coached by Jack Greenwell, that, apart from Sagibarba, also included Paulino Alc\u00e1ntara, Ricardo Zamora, F\u00e9lix Ses\u00famaga and, later, Franz Platko. Between 1919 and 1933 he won twelve Campionat de Catalunya titles, five Copa del Rey and the very first La Liga title.

However, Samitier was later accused of acting as a double agent when the club tried to sign Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano, and in the 1960s, he fell out with Helenio Herrera and went to work for Real Madrid. Despite his role in the Di St\u00e9fano affair,[3] twice defecting to Real Madrid, and his friendship with Francisco Franco,[3] Samitier remained a legendary figure of FC Barcelona.[*citation needed*] When he died in 1972, he was given a state funeral and a street that leads to Camp Nou.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## Club career[edit]\n\n\n### Early life[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Medal record\n |\n| --- |\n| Men's football |\n| Representing ![](image)\u00a0Spain |\n| Olympic Games |\n| ![Silver medal \u2013 second place](image) |  1920 Antwerp  | Team competition |\n\n\n**Josep Samitier Vilalta** (Catalan pronunciation: [\u0292u\u02c8z\u025bp s\u0259miti\u02c8e]; 2 February 1902[2] \u2013 4 May 1972), also known as **Jos\u00e9 Samitier**, was a Spanish football player, manager and scout who played as a midfielder for FC Barcelona, Real Madrid, OGC Nice, the Catalan XI, and Spain. He later coached Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, Nice and Barcelona and worked as a scout for both Barcelona and Real Madrid.\n\n\nDuring his playing career with Barcelona, Samitier scored 187 official goals and was the club's all-time highest goalscorer at the time of his retirement. As of 2020, he is the club's fifth all-time top goalscorer behind Luis Su\u00e1rez, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kubala, C\u00e9sar, and Lionel Messi. As a player, Samitier pioneered the *midfield general* role and was nicknamed *Surrealista* (*The Surrealist*) and *Home Magosta* (*The Grasshopper Man*)[3] due to his style.\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
