The prize has been shared between two individuals on four occasions. It was not awarded on seven occasions. The laureates have included writers in 25 different languages. The youngest laureate was Rudyard Kipling, who was 41 years old when he was awarded in 1907. The oldest laureate to receive the prize was Doris Lessing, who was 88 when she was awarded in 2007. It has been awarded posthumously once, to Erik Axel Karlfeldt in 1931. On some occasions, the awarding institution, the Swedish Academy, has awarded the prize to its own members; Verner von Heidenstam in 1916, the posthumous prize to Karlfeldt in 1931, Pär Lagerkvist in 1951, and the shared prize to Eyvind Johnson and Harry Martinson in 1974. Selma Lagerlöf was elected a member of the Swedish Academy in 1914, five years after she was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1909. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe **Nobel Prize in Literature** (here meaning *for* literature; Swedish: *Nobelpriset i litteratur*) is a Swedish literature prize that is awarded annually, since 1901, to an author from any country who has, in the words of the will of Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel, \"in the field of literature, produced the most outstanding work in an idealistic direction\" (original Swedish: *den som inom litteraturen har producerat det utmärktaste i idealisk riktning*).[2][3] Though individual works are sometimes cited as being particularly noteworthy, the award is based on an author's body of work as a whole. The Swedish Academy decides who, if anyone, will receive the prize. The academy announces the name of the laureate in early October. It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the will of Alfred Nobel in 1895. Literature is traditionally the final award presented at the Nobel Prize ceremony. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n### Controversies about Nobel laureate selections[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Nobel Prize controversies § Literature\n\nFrom 1901 to 1912, the committee, led by the conservative Carl David af Wirsén, assessed the literary quality of a work in relation to its contribution to humanity's pursuit of the \"ideal.\" Leo Tolstoy, Henrik Ibsen, Émile Zola, and Mark Twain were rejected in favour of authors who are little read today.[47][49]\n\n\nLater, the prize has often been controversial due to the Swedish Academy's Eurocentric choices of laureates for political reasons, as seen in the years 1970, 2005, and 2019, and for the Academy awarding its own members, as happened in 1974.[50]\n\n\n\n### Nationality-based criticism[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n61. **^** Warme, Lars G., ed.

In the *Wall Street Journal*, Joseph Epstein wrote, \"You might not know it, but you and I are members of a club whose fellow members include Leo Tolstoy, Henry James, Anton Chekhov, Mark Twain, Henrik Ibsen, Marcel Proust, James Joyce, Jorge Luis Borges and Vladimir Nabokov.

In 2009, Horace Engdahl, then the permanent secretary of the Academy, declared that \"Europe still is the centre of the literary world\" and that \"the US is too isolated, too insular.
