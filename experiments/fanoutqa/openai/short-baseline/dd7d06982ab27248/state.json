There have been three years for which the Nobel Prize in Literature was delayed one year: the prizes for 1915,[13] 1949[14] and 2018[15][16][6] were each awarded together with that of the following year in October of the following year. As of 2022, there have been 29 English-speaking laureates of the Nobel Prize in Literature, followed by French with 16 laureates and German with 14 laureates.

It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the 1895 will of Alfred Nobel, which are awarded for outstanding contributions in chemistry, physics, literature, peace, and physiology or medicine.[1] As dictated by Nobel's will, the award is administered by the Nobel Foundation and awarded by the Swedish Academy.[2] The first Nobel Prize in Literature was awarded in 1901 to Sully Prudhomme of France.[3] Each recipient receives a medal, a diploma and a monetary award prize that has varied throughout the years.[4] In 1901, Prudhomme received 150,782 SEK, which is equivalent to 8,823,637.78 SEK in January 2018. The award is presented in Stockholm at an annual ceremony on December 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death.[5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Alfred Nobel \u2013 The Man Behind the Nobel Prize\".

The prize has been shared between two individuals on four occasions. It was not awarded on seven occasions. The laureates have included writers in 25 different languages. The youngest laureate was Rudyard Kipling, who was 41 years old when he was awarded in 1907. The oldest laureate to receive the prize was Doris Lessing, who was 88 when she was awarded in 2007. It has been awarded posthumously once, to Erik Axel Karlfeldt in 1931. On some occasions, the awarding institution, the Swedish Academy, has awarded the prize to its own members; Verner von Heidenstam in 1916, the posthumous prize to Karlfeldt in 1931, P\u00e4r Lagerkvist in 1951, and the shared prize to Eyvind Johnson and Harry Martinson in 1974. Selma Lagerl\u00f6f was elected a member of the Swedish Academy in 1914, five years after she was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1909. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe **Nobel Prize in Literature** (here meaning *for* literature; Swedish: *Nobelpriset i litteratur*) is a Swedish literature prize that is awarded annually, since 1901, to an author from any country who has, in the words of the will of Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel, \"in the field of literature, produced the most outstanding work in an idealistic direction\" (original Swedish: *den som inom litteraturen har producerat det utm\u00e4rktaste i idealisk riktning*).[2][3] Though individual works are sometimes cited as being particularly noteworthy, the award is based on an author's body of work as a whole. The Swedish Academy decides who, if anyone, will receive the prize. The academy announces the name of the laureate in early October. It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the will of Alfred Nobel in 1895. Literature is traditionally the final award presented at the Nobel Prize ceremony. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n### Controversies about Nobel laureate selections[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Nobel Prize controversies \u00a7\u00a0Literature\n\nFrom 1901 to 1912, the committee, led by the conservative Carl David af Wirs\u00e9n, assessed the literary quality of a work in relation to its contribution to humanity's pursuit of the \"ideal.\" Leo Tolstoy, Henrik Ibsen, \u00c9mile Zola, and Mark Twain were rejected in favour of authors who are little read today.[47][49]\n\n\nLater, the prize has often been controversial due to the Swedish Academy's Eurocentric choices of laureates for political reasons, as seen in the years 1970, 2005, and 2019, and for the Academy awarding its own members, as happened in 1974.[50]\n\n\n\n### Nationality-based criticism[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n61. **^** Warme, Lars G., ed.

Many authors who have won the prize have fallen into obscurity, while others rejected by the jury remain widely studied and read. In the *Wall Street Journal*, Joseph Epstein wrote, \"You might not know it, but you and I are members of a club whose fellow members include Leo Tolstoy, Henry James, Anton Chekhov, Mark Twain, Henrik Ibsen, Marcel Proust, James Joyce, Jorge Luis Borges and Vladimir Nabokov. The club is the Non-Winners of the Nobel Prize in Literature. All these authentically great writers, still alive when the prize, initiated in 1901, was being awarded, didn't win it.\"[43] Other notable names from the non-western canon who were ignored despite being nominated several times for the prize include Sri Aurobindo and Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)French author Albert Camus was the first African-born writer to receive the award.\nThe prize's focus on European men, and Swedes in particular, has been the subject of criticism, even from Swedish newspapers.[51] The majority of laureates have been European, with Sweden itself receiving more prizes (8) than all of Asia (7, if Turkish Orhan Pamuk is included), as well as all of Latin America (7, if Saint Lucian Derek Walcott is included). In 2009, Horace Engdahl, then the permanent secretary of the Academy, declared that \"Europe still is the centre of the literary world\" and that \"the US is too isolated, too insular. They don't translate enough and don't really participate in the big dialogue of literature.\"[52]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n90. **^** Maori writer this year's Neustadt International Prize winner \u2013 *The Norman Transcript*\n91. **^** \"Hans Christian Andersen Award\".
