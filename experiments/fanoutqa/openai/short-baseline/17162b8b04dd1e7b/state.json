Brazil, the only team that has participated in every World Cup, is also the most successful team in the competition, having won five titles and finished second twice.[5] Italy and Germany[n 2] have four titles each, with Germany having reached more finals than any other team, eight. Current champion Argentina has three titles, Uruguay and France have two each, while England and Spain have one each. Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Sweden, the Netherlands and Croatia have played in the final without winning.
