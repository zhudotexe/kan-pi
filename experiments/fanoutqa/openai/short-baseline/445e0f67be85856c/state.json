Besides the *Star Wars* and *Superman* franchises, *James Bond* and *Godzilla* films are still being released periodically; all four are among the highest-grossing franchises. Some of the older films that held the record of highest-grossing film still have respectable grosses by today's standards, but no longer compete numerically against today's top-earners in an era of much higher individual ticket prices. When those prices are adjusted for inflation, however, then *Gone with the Wind*\u2014which was the highest-grossing film outright for twenty-five years\u2014is still the highest-grossing film of all time. All grosses on the list are expressed in U.S. dollars at their nominal value, except where stated otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n## Highest-grossing films[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHighest-grossing films as of 2022[update] adjusted for inflation[35][Inf]\n| Rank\n | Title\n | Worldwide gross(2022 $)\n | Year\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | *Gone with the Wind* | $4,192,000,000\n | 1939\n |\n| 2\n | *Avatar* | A1$3,824,000,000\n | 2009\n |\n| 3\n | *Titanic* | $2,516,000,000T$3,485,000,000\n | 1997\n |\n| 4\n | *Star Wars* | $3,443,000,000\n | 1977\n |\n| 5\n | *Avengers: Endgame* | AE$3,165,000,000\n | 2019\n |\n| 6\n | *The Sound of Music* | $2,884,000,000\n | 1965\n |\n| 7\n | *E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial* | $2,815,000,000\n | 1982\n |\n| 8\n | *The Ten Commandments* | $2,665,000,000\n | 1956\n |\n| 9\n | *Doctor Zhivago* | $2,526,000,000\n | 1965\n |\n| 10\n | *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* | TFA$2,491,000,000\n | 2015\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDespite the inherent difficulties in accounting for inflation, several attempts have been made. Estimates depend on the price index used to adjust the grosses,[31] and the exchange rates used to convert between currencies can also affect the calculations, both of which can have an effect on the ultimate rankings of an inflation adjusted list. *Gone with the Wind*\u2014first released in 1939\u2014is generally considered to be the most successful film, with *Guinness World Records* in 2014 estimating its adjusted global gross at $3.4\u00a0billion. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Established\n | Title\n | Record-setting gross\n | Reference(s)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1915[64] | *The Birth of a Nation* | $5,200,000R | [# 85] |\n| *1940* | $15,000,000R \u2021 | [# 309] |\n| 1940[32] | *Gone with the Wind* | $32,000,000R | [# 135] |\n| *1963* | $67,000,000R \u2021 | [# 310] |\n| 1966[64] | *The Sound of Music* | $114,600,000R | [# 210] |\n| 1971[64] | *Gone with the Wind* | $116,000,000R \u2021 | [# 311] |\n| 1972[64] | *The Godfather* | $127,600,000\u2013142,000,000R | [# 236][# 312] |\n| 1976[87][88] | *Jaws* | $193,700,000R | [# 251] |\n| 1978[89][90] | *Star Wars* | $410,000,000/$268,500,000R | [# 313][# 236] |\n| *1982* | $530,000,000 \u2021 | [# 257] |\n| 1983[91] | *E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial* | $619,000,000\u2013664,000,000\n | [# 257][# 270] |\n| *1993* | $701,000,000 \u2021 | [# 314] |\n| 1993[64] | *Jurassic Park* | $912,667,947\n | [# 73] |\n| 1998[92] | *Titanic* | $1,843,373,318\n | [# 7] |\n| 2010[93][94] | *Avatar* | $2,743,577,587\n | [# 1] |\n| $2,788,416,135 \u2021 |\n| 2019[95][96] | *Avengers: Endgame* | $2,797,501,328\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHigh-grossing films by year of release[47][48][49]\n| Year\n | Title\n | Worldwide gross\n | Budget\n | Reference(s)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1915 | *The Birth of a Nation* | $50,000,000\u2013100,000,000$20,000,000+R ($5,200,000)R | $110,000 | [# 84][# 85][# 86] |\n| 1916 | *Intolerance* | $1,750,000R IN | $385,907 | [50][51] |\n| 1917 | *Cleopatra* | $500,000\\*R | $300,000 | [# 87][# 88] |\n| 1918 | *Mickey* | $8,000,000 | $250,000 | [# 89] |\n| 1919 | *The Miracle Man* | $3,000,000R | $120,000 | [# 90] |\n| 1920 | *Way Down East* | $5,000,000R ($4,000,000)R | $800,000 | [# 91][# 92] |\n| 1921 | *The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse* | $5,000,000R ($4,000,000)R | $600,000\u2013800,000 | [# 93] |\n| 1922 | *Douglas Fairbanks in Robin Hood* | $2,500,000R | $930,042.78 | [# 94][# 95] |\n| 1923 | *The Covered Wagon* | $5,000,000R | $800,000 | [# 96][# 97] |\n| 1924 | *The Sea Hawk* | $3,000,000R | $700,000 | [# 96] |\n| 1925 | *The Big Parade* | $18,000,000\u201322,000,000R  ($6,131,000)R | $382,000 | [# 98][# 99][# 100] |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nT*Guinness*' adjusted total for *Titanic* only increased by $102,000,000 between the 2012 (published in 2011) and 2015 editions, a rise of 4.2% shared by the other adjusted totals in the chart, and omitted the gross from a 3D re-release in 2012.[35][38] This chart incorporates the gross of $343,550,770 from the reissue and adjusts it from the 2013 index.[39] *Titanic* grossed a further $762,994 during limited re-releases in 2017 and 2020, but this sum is not represented in the adjusted total.[40]\n\n\nAEThe gross for *Avengers: Endgame* is adjusted from the 2020 index.\n\n\nTFAThe gross for *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* is adjusted from the 2016 index.\n\n## High-grossing films by year[edit]\n\n\nGlossary: Distributor rentals\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHighest-grossing films[12]\n| Rank\n | Peak\n | Title\n | Worldwide gross\n | Year\n | Reference(s)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | 1\n | *Avatar* | $2,923,706,026\n | 2009\n | [# 1][# 2] |\n| 2\n | 1\n | *Avengers: Endgame* | $2,797,501,328\n | 2019\n | [# 3][# 4] |\n| 3\n | 3\n | *Avatar: The Way of Water* | $2,320,250,281\n | 2022\n | [# 5][# 6] |\n| 4\n | 1\n | *Titanic* | T$2,257,844,554\n | 1997\n | [# 7][# 8] |\n| 5\n | 3\n | *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* | $2,068,223,624\n | 2015\n | [# 9][# 10] |\n| 6\n | 4\n | *Avengers: Infinity War* | $2,048,359,754\n | 2018\n | [# 11][# 12] |\n| 7\n | 6\n | *Spider-Man: No Way Home* | $1,921,847,111\n | 2021\n | [# 13][# 14] |\n| 8\n | 3\n | *Jurassic World* | $1,671,537,444\n | 2015\n | [# 15][# 16] |\n| 9\n | 7\n | *The Lion King* | $1,656,943,394\n | 2019\n | [# 17][# 4] |\n| 10\n | 3\n | *The Avengers* | $1,518,815,515\n | 2012\n | [# 18][# 19] |\n| 11\n | 4\n | *Furious 7* | $1,515,341,399\n | 2015\n | [# 20][# 21] |\n| 12\n | 11\n | *Top Gun: Maverick* | $1,495,696,292\n | 2022\n | [# 22][# 23] |\n| 13\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nInfInflation adjustment is carried out using the Consumer price index for advanced economies published by the International Monetary Fund.[36] The index is uniformly applied to the grosses in the chart published by *Guinness World Records* in 2014, beginning with the 2014 index.
