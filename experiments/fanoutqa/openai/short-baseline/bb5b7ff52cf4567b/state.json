The College of Philadelphia, which became Penn, College of New Jersey, which became Princeton University, and King's College, which later became Columbia College and ultimately Columbia University, all originated within a few years of each other. After initially designating 1750 as its founding date, Penn later considered 1749 to be its founding date for more than a century with Penn alumni observing a centennial celebration in 1849. In 1895, several elite universities in the United States convened in New York City as the Intercollegiate Commission at the invitation of John J. McCook, a Union Army officer during the American Civil War and member of Princeton's board of trustees who chaired its Committee on Academic Dress. The primary purpose of the conference was to standardize American academic regalia, which was accomplished through the adoption of the Intercollegiate Code on Academic Costume. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe University of Pennsylvania considers itself the fourth-oldest institution of higher education in the United States, though this is contested by Princeton and Columbia Universities.[note 4]\n\n\nUnlike the other colonial colleges that existed in 1749, including Harvard, William & Mary, Yale, and the College of New Jersey, Franklin's new school did not focus exclusively on educating clergy. He advocated what was then an innovative concept of higher education, which taught both the ornamental knowledge of the arts and the practical skills necessary for making a living and performing public service. The proposed program of study could have become the nation's first modern liberal arts curriculum, although it was never implemented because Anglican priest William Smith, who became the first provost, and other trustees strongly preferred the traditional curriculum.[46][47]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe **University of Pennsylvania** (often abbreviated simply as **Penn**[12] or **UPenn**[13]) is a private Ivy League research university in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It is one of nine colonial colleges and was chartered prior to the U.S. Declaration of Independence when Benjamin Franklin, the university's founder and first president, advocated for an educational institution that trained leaders in academia, commerce, and public service. Penn identifies as the fourth oldest institution of higher education in the United States, though this representation is challenged by other universities, as Franklin first convened the Board of Trustees in 1749, arguably making it the fifth oldest institution of higher education in the U.S.[note 2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHowever, Princeton has not asserted this, and a Princeton historian says that \"the facts do not warrant\" such an interpretation.[40] Columbia also implicitly challenges Penn's use of either 1750, 1749 or 1740 as its founding date since it claims to be the fifth-oldest institution of higher learning in the United States after Harvard, William & Mary, Yale, and Princeton based on its charter date of 1754 and Penn's charter date of 1755.[41] Academic histories of American higher education typically list Penn variously as either the nation's fifth or sixth-oldest institution of higher learning in the nation after Princeton and immediately before or after Columbia.[42][43][44]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nColonial colleges\n |\n| --- |\n| * Brown\n* Columbia\n* Dartmouth\n* Harvard\n* Penn\n* Princeton\n* Rutgers\n* William & Mary\n* Yale\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nQuestBridge partner institutions\n |\n| --- |\n| * Amherst\n* Barnard\n* Boston C\n* Boston U\n* Bowdoin\n* Brown\n* Caltech\n* Carleton\n* Case Western Reserve\n* Claremont McKenna\n* Colby\n* Colgate\n* Holy Cross\n* Colorado\n* Columbia\n* Cornell\n* Dartmouth\n* Davidson\n* Denison\n* Duke\n* Emory\n* Grinnell\n* Hamilton\n* Haverford\n* Johns Hopkins\n* Macalester\n* MIT\n* Middlebury\n* Northwestern\n* Oberlin\n* Pomona\n* Princeton\n* Rice\n* Scripps\n* Skidmore\n* Smith\n* Stanford\n* Swarthmore\n* Tufts\n* Chicago\n* Notre Dame\n* Pennsylvania\n* Southern California\n* Virginia\n* Vanderbilt\n* Vassar\n* Washington and Lee\n* Washington St. Louis\n* Wellesley\n* Wesleyan\n* Williams\n* Yale\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * ![](image) **Category**\n* ![](image) **Commons**\n |\n\n| Links to related articles\n |\n| --- |\n| | * v\n* t\n* e\nIvy League\n |\n| --- |\n| Teams | * Brown Bears\n* Columbia Lions\n* Cornell Big Red\n* Dartmouth Big Green\n* Harvard Crimson\n* Penn Quakers\n* Princeton Tigers\n* Yale Bulldogs\n |\n| Competitions | * Baseball\n* Basketball (men's)\n* Basketball (women's)\n* Fencing\n* Rugby\n |\n| Related topics | * Big Three\n* Business schools\n* Digital Network\n* Ivy Council\n* Law schools\n* Medical schools\n* Nude posture photos\n* Public Ivy\n* Public policy schools\n* *Take Ivy*\n* Y Tu Tambien\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
