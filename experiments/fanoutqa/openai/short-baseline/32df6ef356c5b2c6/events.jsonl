In 2005, 588– or about 3.9%– of the Ivies' 14,831 full-time faculty members were Black.[163] This proportion decreased to 3.4% in 2015.[164] Notably, in 2001, Ruth J. Simmons became the president of Brown University, making her the first and only Black president of an Ivy League institution.[165]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Princeton | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | 14\n |\n| Yale | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | 13\n |\n| Totals | 8 | 8 | 8 | 5 | 8 | 7 | 7 | 6 | 8 | 7 | 8 | 8 | 8 | 8 | 104\n |\n\n\n#### Men's varsity sports not sponsored by the Ivy League[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Franklin Delano Roosevelt, third from left, top row, with his Harvard class in 1904\nOf the 45[e] persons who have served as President of the United States, 16 have graduated from an Ivy League university. Of them, eight have degrees from Harvard, five from Yale, three from Columbia, two from Princeton and one from Penn. Twelve presidents have earned Ivy undergraduate degrees. Four of these were transfer students: Woodrow Wilson transferred from Davidson College, Barack Obama transferred from Occidental College, Donald Trump transferred from Fordham University, and John F. Kennedy transferred from Princeton to Harvard. John Adams was the first president to graduate from college, graduating from Harvard in 1755.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2021, all eight Ivy League schools recorded record high numbers of applications and record low acceptance rates.[95][104][96][97][98][105] Year over year increases in the number of applicants ranged from a 14.5% increase at Princeton to a 51% increase at Columbia.[99][100]\n\n\nThere have been arguments that Ivy League schools discriminate against Asian-American candidates. For example, in August 2020, the US Justice Department argued that Yale University discriminated against Asian-American candidates on the basis of their race, a charge the university denied.[106] Harvard was subject to a similar challenge in 2019 from an Asian American student group, with regard to which a federal judge found Harvard to be in compliance with constitutional requirements. The student group has since appealed that decision, and the appeal is still pending as of August 2020.[106]\n\n\n\n### Prestige[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Nobel laureates by university affiliation\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Executive Director Robin Harris\".

In particular, Princeton won 26 recognized national championships in college football (last in 1935), and Yale won 18 (last in 1927).[223] Both of these totals are considerably higher than those of other historically strong programs such as Alabama, which has won 15, Notre Dame, which claims 11 but is credited by many sources with 13, and USC, which has won 11. Yale, whose coach Walter Camp was the \"Father of American Football,\" held on to its place as the all-time wins leader in college football throughout the entire 20th century, but was finally passed by Michigan on November 10, 2001. Harvard, Yale, Princeton and Penn each have over a dozen former scholar-athletes enshrined in the College Football Hall of Fame. \n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_fpmTHLrC6AV09y8QTxnkX7tu","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
