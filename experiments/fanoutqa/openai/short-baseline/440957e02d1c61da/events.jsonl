The People's Republic of China, according to its data, would be the second-largest with 17.90% of the world net wealth,[130] but is excluded because of its relatively low net wealth per adult and Human Development Index.[20] As of 2021, Crédit Suisse reports the G7 (without the European Union) represents around 53% of the global net wealth;[131] including the EU, the G7 accounts for over 60% of the global net wealth.[131]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOriginating from an *ad hoc* gathering of finance ministers in 1973, the G7 has since become a formal, high-profile venue for discussing and coordinating solutions to major global issues, especially in the areas of trade, security, economics, and climate change.[4] Each member's head of government or state, along with the EU's Commission President and European Council President, meet annually at the G7 Summit; other high-ranking officials of the G7 and the EU meet throughout the year. Representatives of other states and international organizations are often invited as guests, with Russia having been a formal member (as part of the G8) from 1997 until its expulsion in 2014.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nDefence ministers of the Group of Seven\n |\n| --- |\n| * ![](image) Blair\n* ![](image) Lecornu\n* ![](image) Pistorius\n* ![](image) Crosetto\n* ![](image) Kihara\n* ![](image) Shapps\n* ![](image) Austin\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nInterior ministers of the Group of Seven\n |\n| --- |\n| * ![Canada](image) LeBlanc\n* ![France](image) Darmanin\n* ![Germany](image) Faeser\n* ![Italy](image) Piantedosi\n* ![Japan](image) Suzuki\n* ![United Kingdom](image) Cleverly\n* ![United States](image) Mayorkas\n* ![European Union](image) Johansson\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nJustice ministers of the Group of Seven\n |\n| --- |\n| * ![](image) Virani\n* ![](image) Dupond-Moretti\n* ![](image) Buschmann\n* ![](image) Nordio\n* ![](image) Koizumi\n* ![](image) Chalk\n* ![](image) Garland\n* ![](image) Reynders\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2023, Japan's prime minister Fumio Kishida invited South Korea, Australia, India, Indonesia, Brazil, Vietnam, Comoros (representing the African Union), the Cook Islands (representing the Pacific Islands Forum) and Ukraine to the 49th summit hosted in Hiroshima.[41][42][43][44][45][46]\n\n\n\n## Activities and initiatives[edit]\n\n\n![G7 is located in Europe](image)![1st](image)\n1st\n![3rd, 10th, 17th](image)\n3rd, 10th, 17th\n![4th, 11th](image)\n4th, 11th\n![6th, 13th](image)\n6th, 13th\n![8th](image)\n8th\n![15th](image)\n15th\n![18th](image)\n18th\n![20th](image)\n20th\n![22nd](image)\n22nd\n![24th](image)\n24th\n![25th](image)\n25th\n![27th](image)\n27th\n![29th](image)\n29th\n![31st](image)\n31st\n![32nd](image)\n32nd\n![33rd](image)\n33rd\n![35th](image)\n35th\n![37th](image)\n37th\n![39th](image)\n39th\n![40th](image)\n40th\n![41st](image)\n41st\n![43rd'](image)\n43rd'\n![45th](image)\n45th\n![47th](image)\n47th\nclass=notpageimage|\nHost venues of G7 summits in Europe\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 44th | 8–9 June 2018 | ![](image) Canada[104] | Justin Trudeau | La Malbaie, Québec (Charlevoix)[105] | The summit took place at the Manoir Richelieu.

The People's Republic of China, according to its data, would be the second-largest with 17.90% of the world net wealth,[130] but is excluded because of its relatively low net wealth per adult and Human Development Index.[20] As of 2021, Crédit Suisse reports the G7 (without the European Union) represents around 53% of the global net wealth;[131] including the EU, the G7 accounts for over 60% of the global net wealth.[131]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOriginating from an *ad hoc* gathering of finance ministers in 1973, the G7 has since become a formal, high-profile venue for discussing and coordinating solutions to major global issues, especially in the areas of trade, security, economics, and climate change.[4] Each member's head of government or state, along with the EU's Commission President and European Council President, meet annually at the G7 Summit; other high-ranking officials of the G7 and the EU meet throughout the year. Representatives of other states and international organizations are often invited as guests, with Russia having been a formal member (as part of the G8) from 1997 until its expulsion in 2014.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nDefence ministers of the Group of Seven\n |\n| --- |\n| * ![](image) Blair\n* ![](image) Lecornu\n* ![](image) Pistorius\n* ![](image) Crosetto\n* ![](image) Kihara\n* ![](image) Shapps\n* ![](image) Austin\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nInterior ministers of the Group of Seven\n |\n| --- |\n| * ![Canada](image) LeBlanc\n* ![France](image) Darmanin\n* ![Germany](image) Faeser\n* ![Italy](image) Piantedosi\n* ![Japan](image) Suzuki\n* ![United Kingdom](image) Cleverly\n* ![United States](image) Mayorkas\n* ![European Union](image) Johansson\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nJustice ministers of the Group of Seven\n |\n| --- |\n| * ![](image) Virani\n* ![](image) Dupond-Moretti\n* ![](image) Buschmann\n* ![](image) Nordio\n* ![](image) Koizumi\n* ![](image) Chalk\n* ![](image) Garland\n* ![](image) Reynders\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2023, Japan's prime minister Fumio Kishida invited South Korea, Australia, India, Indonesia, Brazil, Vietnam, Comoros (representing the African Union), the Cook Islands (representing the Pacific Islands Forum) and Ukraine to the 49th summit hosted in Hiroshima.[41][42][43][44][45][46]\n\n\n\n## Activities and initiatives[edit]\n\n\n![G7 is located in Europe](image)![1st](image)\n1st\n![3rd, 10th, 17th](image)\n3rd, 10th, 17th\n![4th, 11th](image)\n4th, 11th\n![6th, 13th](image)\n6th, 13th\n![8th](image)\n8th\n![15th](image)\n15th\n![18th](image)\n18th\n![20th](image)\n20th\n![22nd](image)\n22nd\n![24th](image)\n24th\n![25th](image)\n25th\n![27th](image)\n27th\n![29th](image)\n29th\n![31st](image)\n31st\n![32nd](image)\n32nd\n![33rd](image)\n33rd\n![35th](image)\n35th\n![37th](image)\n37th\n![39th](image)\n39th\n![40th](image)\n40th\n![41st](image)\n41st\n![43rd'](image)\n43rd'\n![45th](image)\n45th\n![47th](image)\n47th\nclass=notpageimage|\nHost venues of G7 summits in Europe\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 44th | 8–9 June 2018 | ![](image) Canada[104] | Justin Trudeau | La Malbaie, Québec (Charlevoix)[105] | The summit took place at the Manoir Richelieu.

Climate, along with commerce trades, was one of the main themes. \"*Working together on climate change, oceans and clean energy*.\"[106] The final statement contained 28 points.
