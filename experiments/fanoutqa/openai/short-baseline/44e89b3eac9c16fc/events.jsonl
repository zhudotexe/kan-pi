Dark and Steel types fare well against \"Psychic\" attacks, which was a dominant type in *Red* and *Blue*. The concept of breeding was introduced in the second generation of *Pokémon* games as well, which allows players to manipulate the skills of their Pokémon to a greater degree.[1] Some of the new Pokémon introduced in *Gold* and *Silver* are pre-evolutions of other Pokémon, such as Pichu and Igglybuff. These baby Pokémon are only available by breeding their evolved forms.\n\n\n*Pokémon Gold* and *Silver* were first revealed at Nintendo Space World in 1997. At this point, the game had a massively larger world map than the final game and this prototype featured around 40 Pokémon designs that were removed and replaced when the games were released in 1999.[2]\n\n\n\n\n## List of Pokémon[edit]\n\n\nPokémon\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Details on Pokémon names, National Pokédex numbers, types and evolutions are obtained from The Pokémon Company International's online Pokédex.[3]\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** Prior to *X* and *Y*, Cleffa, Igglybuff, Togepi, Snubbull and Granbull were pure Normal types, while Togetic was Normal/Flying.\n3. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Starting in *X* and *Y*, Marill and Azumarill gained the Fairy type.\n4. **^** Paldean Wooper (introduced in *Pokémon Scarlet* and *Violet*) are capable of evolving into Clodsire.\n5. **^** Only Galarian Corsola (introduced in *Pokémon Sword* and *Shield*) are capable of evolving into Cursola.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nList of Pokémon species introduced in Generation II (1999)[nb 1]\n| Name\n | National Pokédexnumber\n | Type(s) | Evolves from\n | Evolves into\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| English\n | Japanese\n | Primary\n | Secondary\n |\n| Chikorita\n | *Chikorita* (チコリータ)[4] | 0152 | Grass\n | Beginning of evolution\n | Bayleef (#153) | A small quadrupedal green Pokémon with a large lime green leaf on its head.

Some Pokémon in this generation were introduced in animated adaptations of the franchise before *Gold* and *Silver*, such as Ho-Oh in the first episode of the *Pokémon* anime series in 1998 and 1999, Togepi, which was a recurring character in the anime owned by Misty, Donphan in the Pokémon first movie in 1998, Snubbull in the first Pikachu short movie in 1998, and Marill, which also debuted in that short film and was a recurring character in the anime owned by Tracey Sketchit in 1998 and 1999.

Ho-Oh resurrected it after it perished as a helpless unknown animal in a burning tower. Some say that it is a Water type because it symbolizes the rain that put out the fire in the building.

Dark and Steel types fare well against \"Psychic\" attacks, which was a dominant type in *Red* and *Blue*. The concept of breeding was introduced in the second generation of *Pokémon* games as well, which allows players to manipulate the skills of their Pokémon to a greater degree.[1] Some of the new Pokémon introduced in *Gold* and *Silver* are pre-evolutions of other Pokémon, such as Pichu and Igglybuff. These baby Pokémon are only available by breeding their evolved forms.\n\n\n*Pokémon Gold* and *Silver* were first revealed at Nintendo Space World in 1997. At this point, the game had a massively larger world map than the final game and this prototype featured around 40 Pokémon designs that were removed and replaced when the games were released in 1999.[2]\n\n\n\n\n## List of Pokémon[edit]\n\n\nPokémon\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Details on Pokémon names, National Pokédex numbers, types and evolutions are obtained from The Pokémon Company International's online Pokédex.[3]\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** Prior to *X* and *Y*, Cleffa, Igglybuff, Togepi, Snubbull and Granbull were pure Normal types, while Togetic was Normal/Flying.\n3. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Starting in *X* and *Y*, Marill and Azumarill gained the Fairy type.\n4. **^** Paldean Wooper (introduced in *Pokémon Scarlet* and *Violet*) are capable of evolving into Clodsire.\n5. **^** Only Galarian Corsola (introduced in *Pokémon Sword* and *Shield*) are capable of evolving into Cursola.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nList of Pokémon species introduced in Generation II (1999)[nb 1]\n| Name\n | National Pokédexnumber\n | Type(s) | Evolves from\n | Evolves into\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| English\n | Japanese\n | Primary\n | Secondary\n |\n| Chikorita\n | *Chikorita* (チコリータ)[4] | 0152 | Grass\n | Beginning of evolution\n | Bayleef (#153) | A small quadrupedal green Pokémon with a large lime green leaf on its head.

Ho-Oh resurrected it after it perished as a helpless unknown animal in a burning tower. Some say that it is a Water type because it symbolizes the rain that put out the fire in the building.
