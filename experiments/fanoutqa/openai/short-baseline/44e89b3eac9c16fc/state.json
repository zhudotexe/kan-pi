It flies with the crackle and buzz of electricity. It has the power to control electricity and anyone that gets struck by its lightning can gain power from it. It's said that when it rubs its feathers together, lightning will fall immediately after. There are tales of Zapdos resting in pitch black thunderclouds.

It is famed for being the first Pok\u00e9mon to learn Fire Punch, and signature Pok\u00e9mon of Gym leader Blaine.\n |\n| Pinsir\n | *Kairosu* (\u30ab\u30a4\u30ed\u30b9) | 0127 | Bug\n | Beginning of evolution\n | Mega Evolution | It likes to throw things with its massive horns. It can throw things two times from its weight. It was originally supposed to have an evolution called \"Plux\" in Generation II. Some speculated this unused design was reworked into Heracross.[*citation needed*] Pinsir appears as a tan-brown bug, similar in appearance to an earwig with its pinchers on its head, and a vertical slit like mouth. It gains the Flying type upon Mega Evolution.\n |\n| Tauros\n | *Kentarosu* (\u30b1\u30f3\u30bf\u30ed\u30b9) | 0128 | Normal\n | No evolution\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Lapras | *Rapurasu* (\u30e9\u30d7\u30e9\u30b9) | 0131 | Water\n | Ice\n | Beginning of evolution\n | Gigantamax | It has a very gentle nature and was hunted before it became illegal. Gigantamax Lapras is exclusive to *Shield*. Lapras is based on the Loch Ness Monster and the plesiosaur. In the games, any Pok\u00e9mon that uses Surf appears in the overworld as a Lapras or a Mantine. Its Gigantamax form has \"water magic\" around it.\n |\n| Ditto\n | *Metamon* (\u30e1\u30bf\u30e2\u30f3) | 0132 | Normal\n | No evolution\n | Ditto is capable of transforming into any Pok\u00e9mon that it comes across. It was originally intended to have an evolution in Generation II called \"Animon\" which would have evolved from a Metal Coat. Fan speculation is that Ditto and Mew are related as Mew can also use Transform, a move exclusive to Ditto.[*citation needed*] In the anime, Ditto belonging to Duplica had an issue with accurately mimicking appearances where its face always looked like Ditto's own. It appears as a pink blob or amoeba.\n |\n| Eevee | *\u012abui* (\u30a4\u30fc\u30d6\u30a4) | 0133 | Normal\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | Rhydon (#112) | Its tackles can demolish skyscrapers, but its memory isn't the best. Once it starts going, it sometimes cannot remember why it started.

Unlike Rhyhorn, it is bipedal. It eventually gained an evolution, Rhyperior, after being traded with a Protector.\n |\n| Chansey\n | *Rakk\u012b* (\u30e9\u30c3\u30ad\u30fc) | 0113 | Normal\n | Happiny (#440) | Blissey (#242) | In generation II, Blissey was added as an evolution, and in generation IV, Happiny was added as a pre-evolution. In generation I, Chansey was a stand-alone Pok\u00e9mon. It appears as a pink oblong shaped creature with stubby arms and feet. It carries eggs in its pouch and is typically used by Pok\u00e9mon Centres for the egg's healing properties.\n |\n| Tangela\n | *Monjara* (\u30e2\u30f3\u30b8\u30e3\u30e9) | 0114 | Grass\n | Beginning of evolution\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Dark and Steel types fare well against \"Psychic\" attacks, which was a dominant type in *Red* and *Blue*. The concept of breeding was introduced in the second generation of *Pok\u00e9mon* games as well, which allows players to manipulate the skills of their Pok\u00e9mon to a greater degree.[1] Some of the new Pok\u00e9mon introduced in *Gold* and *Silver* are pre-evolutions of other Pok\u00e9mon, such as Pichu and Igglybuff. These baby Pok\u00e9mon are only available by breeding their evolved forms.\n\n\n*Pok\u00e9mon Gold* and *Silver* were first revealed at Nintendo Space World in 1997. At this point, the game had a massively larger world map than the final game and this prototype featured around 40 Pok\u00e9mon designs that were removed and replaced when the games were released in 1999.[2]\n\n\n\n\n## List of Pok\u00e9mon[edit]\n\n\nPok\u00e9mon\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Details on Pok\u00e9mon names, National Pok\u00e9dex numbers, types and evolutions are obtained from The Pok\u00e9mon Company International's online Pok\u00e9dex.[3]\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** Prior to *X* and *Y*, Cleffa, Igglybuff, Togepi, Snubbull and Granbull were pure Normal types, while Togetic was Normal/Flying.\n3. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Starting in *X* and *Y*, Marill and Azumarill gained the Fairy type.\n4. **^** Paldean Wooper (introduced in *Pok\u00e9mon Scarlet* and *Violet*) are capable of evolving into Clodsire.\n5. **^** Only Galarian Corsola (introduced in *Pok\u00e9mon Sword* and *Shield*) are capable of evolving into Cursola.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nList of Pok\u00e9mon species introduced in Generation II (1999)[nb 1]\n| Name\n | National Pok\u00e9dexnumber\n | Type(s) | Evolves from\n | Evolves into\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| English\n | Japanese\n | Primary\n | Secondary\n |\n| Chikorita\n | *Chikorita* (\u30c1\u30b3\u30ea\u30fc\u30bf)[4] | 0152 | Grass\n | Beginning of evolution\n | Bayleef (#153) | A small quadrupedal green Pok\u00e9mon with a large lime green leaf on its head.

Some Pok\u00e9mon in this generation were introduced in animated adaptations of the franchise before *Gold* and *Silver*, such as Ho-Oh in the first episode of the *Pok\u00e9mon* anime series in 1998 and 1999, Togepi, which was a recurring character in the anime owned by Misty, Donphan in the Pok\u00e9mon first movie in 1998, Snubbull in the first Pikachu short movie in 1998, and Marill, which also debuted in that short film and was a recurring character in the anime owned by Tracey Sketchit in 1998 and 1999. Elekid, Bellossom, Ledyba, and Hoothoot debuted in Pikachu's Rescue Adventure and Lugia and Slowking debuted in Pok\u00e9mon 2000.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nStating that \"it was too late, we couldn't suddenly change Lugia into a female\", the change was so significant to him that it made him start \"gulping down alcohol and drugs\" and \"feel like [he] wanted to die\".

Ho-Oh has the distinction of being the first Generation II Pok\u00e9mon ever seen, debuting in the very first episode of the Pok\u00e9mon anime long before the revelation of Johto, the episode was \"Pok\u00e9mon, I Choose You!\".\n |\n| Celebi\n | *Celebi* (\u30bb\u30ec\u30d3\u30a3)[42] | 0251 | Psychic\n | Grass\n | No evolution\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | Suicune is one of three Pok\u00e9mon designed by Muneo Sait\u014d.[40] It has the ability to purify the dirtiest of water. It tends to run across the land, and it is said that somehow the northern winds will blow as it appears. It is always in search of a pure reservoir. Ho-Oh resurrected it after it perished as a helpless unknown animal in a burning tower. Some say that it is a Water type because it symbolizes the rain that put out the fire in the building. It is the main legendary of Pok\u00e9mon Crystal. It had a major role in *Pok\u00e9mon 4Ever*.\n |\n| Larvitar\n | *Y\u014dgirasu* (\u30e8\u30fc\u30ae\u30e9\u30b9)[13] | 0246 | Rock\n | Ground\n | Beginning of evolution\n | Pupitar (#247) | Born deep underground, it cannot emerge until it has eaten a mountain's worth of soil to get to its parents.
