Being a vast research community, the university aims at expanding its academic connections globally.[5]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### 1456–1600: Founding[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nUniversities in Germany\n |\n| --- |\n| Baden-Württemberg | * Heidelberg\n* Freiburg\n* Karlsruhe\n* Konstanz\n* Mannheim\n* Hohenheim\n* Stuttgart\n* Tübingen\n* Ulm\n* Zeppelin University\n |\n| Bavaria | * Augsburg\n* Bamberg\n* Bayreuth\n* Eichstätt-Ingolstadt\n* Erlangen-Nuremberg\n* Ingolstadt\n* LMU Munich\n* BU Munich\n* TU Munich\n* Ukrainian Free University in Munich\n* Passau\n* Regensburg\n* Würzburg\n |\n| Berlin | * Berlin University of the Arts\n* FU Berlin\n* HU Berlin\n* TU Berlin\n |\n| Brandenburg | * TU Brandenburg\n* Frankfurt (Oder)\n* Potsdam\n |\n| Bremen | * Bremen\n* Constructor University\n |\n| Hamburg | * Hamburg\n* TU Hamburg\n* HafenCity University Hamburg\n* Helmut Schmidt University\n |\n| Hesse | * TU Darmstadt\n* Frankfurt (Main)\n* Giessen\n* Kassel\n* Marburg\n |\n| Lower Saxony | * TU Braunschweig\n* TU Clausthal\n* Göttingen\n* Hannover\n* Hildesheim\n* Lüneburg\n* Oldenburg\n* Osnabrück\n* Vechta\n |\n| Mecklenburg-Vorpommern | * Greifswald\n* Rostock\n |\n| North Rhine-Westphalia | * Aachen\n* Bielefeld\n* Bochum\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of University of Greifswald people, Category:University of Greifswald alumni, and Category:Academic staff of the University of Greifswald\n\n![](image)Prince Bernhard von Bülow—Chancellor of the German Empire from 1900 to 1909—Emperor Wilhelm II of Germany, and Rudolf von Valentini (left to right) on board *SMY Hohenzollern* in 1908\n![](image)Johannes Bugenhagen (1485–1558) – religious reformer in North Germany, Denmark and Norway; friend of Martin Luther.\nThe University of Greifswald is associated with a number of notable people, including both former students and faculty.

The university consists of twelve faculties and offers degree programmes at undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral levels in some 100 disciplines.[7] The language of instruction is usually German, while a considerable number of graduate degrees are offered in English as well as some in French.[8][9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs a consequence of the disturbances caused by the French Revolution, and particularly because of the Treaty of Lunéville, the university lost all its property on the left bank of the Rhine, so that its complete dissolution was expected.[31]\n\n\n\n### 19th and early 20th century[edit]\n\n\nThis decline did not stop until 1803, when the university was reestablished as a state-owned institution by Karl Friedrich, Grand Duke of Baden, to whom the part of the Palatinate situated on the right bank of the Rhine was allotted. Since then, the university bears his name together with the name of Ruprecht I. Karl Friedrich divided the university into five faculties and placed himself at its head as rector, as did also his successors. During this decade, Romanticism found expression in Heidelberg through Clemens Brentano, Achim von Arnim, Ludwig Tieck, Joseph Görres, and Joseph von Eichendorff, and there went forth a revival of the German Middle Ages in speech, poetry, and art.[28]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHeidelberg University| *Ruprecht-Karls-Universität Heidelberg*\n |\n| ![](image)Seal of the *Ruperto Carola Heidelbergensis*\n |\n| Motto | **Semper apertus** (Latin)[1] |\n| Motto in English\n | Always open |\n| Type | Public |\n| Established | 18 October 1386; 637 years ago (18 October 1386) |\n| Budget | €764.9 million (2018)[2] |\n| Chancellor | Holger Schroeter |\n| President | Bernhard Eitel |\n| Administrative staff\n | 8,397[3] |\n| Students | 28,653 (WS2019/20)[4] |\n| Undergraduates | 15,289[5] |\n| Postgraduates | 11,871[5] |\n| Doctoral students\n | 3,024[5] |\n| Location | Heidelberg\n, Baden-Württemberg\n, Germany\n49°24′37″N 8°42′23″E﻿ / ﻿49.41028°N 8.70639°E﻿ / 49.41028; 8.70639 |\n| Campus | Urban/University town and suburban |\n| Colors | Sandstone red and gold    |\n| Affiliations | German Universities Excellence Initiative, LERU, Coimbra Group, U15, EUA |\n| Website | uni-heidelberg.de/en ![Edit this at Wikidata](image) |\n| ![](image) |\n| Data as of 2013[update] |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDuring the late 19th century, the university housed a very liberal and open-minded spirit, which was deliberately fostered by Max Weber, Ernst Troeltsch and a circle of colleagues around them.\n\n\nIn February 1900, the Grand Duchy of Baden issued a decree that gave women the right to access universities in Baden. Thus, the universities of Freiburg and Heidelberg were the first ones to allow women to study.\n\n\nIn the Weimar Republic, the university was widely recognized as a center of democratic thinking, coined by professors like Karl Jaspers, Gustav Radbruch, Martin Dibelius and Alfred Weber.[28] Unfortunately, there were also dark forces working within the university: Nazi physicist Philipp Lenard was head of the physical institute during that time. Following the assassination of the liberal German-Jewish Foreign Minister Walther Rathenau, he refused to half mast the national flag on the institute, thereby provoking its storming by communist students.[29]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMeanwhile, the university itself continued to lose in prestige until the reign of the last elector Charles Theodore, Elector Palatine, who established new chairs for all the faculties, founded scientific institutes such as the Electoral Academy of Science, and transferred the school of political economy from Kaiserslautern to Heidelberg, where it was combined with the university as the faculty of political economy. He also founded an observatory in the neighboring city of Mannheim, where Jesuit Christian Mayer labored as director. In connection with the four hundredth anniversary of the university, the elector approved a revised statute book that several professors had been commissioned to prepare. The financial affairs of the university, its receipts and expenditures, were put in order. At that time, the number of students varied from 300 to 400; in the jubilee year, 133 matriculated.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPhilosophers Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Karl Jaspers, Hans-Georg Gadamer, and Jürgen Habermas served as university professors, as did also the pioneering scientists Hermann von Helmholtz, Robert Wilhelm Bunsen, Gustav Robert Kirchhoff, Emil Kraepelin, the founder of scientific psychiatry, and outstanding social scientists such as Max Weber, the founding father of modern sociology.\n\n\nPresent faculty include Medicine Nobel Laureates Bert Sakmann (1991) and Harald zur Hausen (2008), Chemistry Nobel Laureate Stefan Hell (2014), seven Leibniz laureates, former justice of the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany Paul Kirchhof, and Rüdiger Wolfrum, the former president of the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea.\n\n\n\n## In fiction and popular culture[edit]\n\n\n### Literature[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe university has its own museum, in the main building of the old campus.

Former university affiliates in the field of religion include Pope Pius II, cardinals, bishops, and with Philipp Melanchthon and Zacharias Ursinus, two key leaders of the Protestant Reformation. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nGerman Excellence Universities\n |\n| --- |\n| Current | * RWTH Aachen (2007–)\n* Free University of Berlin (2007–)\n* Humboldt University of Berlin (2012–)\n* Technical University of Berlin (2019–)\n* Charité (2019–)\n* University of Bonn (2019–)\n* TU Dresden (2012–)\n* University of Hamburg (2019–)\n* University of Heidelberg (2007–)\n* Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (2006–2012; 2019–)\n* University of Konstanz (2007–)\n* Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich (2006–)\n* Technical University of Munich (2006–)\n* University of Tübingen (2012–)\n |\n| Former | * University of Bremen (2012–2019)\n* University of Cologne (2012–2019)\n* University of Freiburg (2007–2012)\n* University of Göttingen (2007–2012)\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nUniversities in Germany\n |\n| --- |\n| Baden-Württemberg | * Heidelberg\n* Freiburg\n* Karlsruhe\n* Konstanz\n* Mannheim\n* Hohenheim\n* Stuttgart\n* Tübingen\n* Ulm\n* Zeppelin University\n |\n| Bavaria | * Augsburg\n* Bamberg\n* Bayreuth\n* Eichstätt-Ingolstadt\n* Erlangen-Nuremberg\n* Ingolstadt\n* LMU Munich\n* BU Munich\n* TU Munich\n* Ukrainian Free University in Munich\n* Passau\n* Regensburg\n* Würzburg\n |\n| Berlin | * Berlin University of the Arts\n* FU Berlin\n* HU Berlin\n* TU Berlin\n |\n| Brandenburg | * TU Brandenburg\n* Frankfurt (Oder)\n* Potsdam\n |\n| Bremen | * Bremen\n* Constructor University\n |\n| Hamburg | * Hamburg\n* TU Hamburg\n* HafenCity University Hamburg\n* Helmut Schmidt University\n |\n| Hesse | * TU Darmstadt\n* Frankfurt (Main)\n* Giessen\n* Kassel\n* Marburg\n |\n| Lower Saxony | * TU Braunschweig\n* TU Clausthal\n* Göttingen\n* Hannover\n* Hildesheim\n* Lüneburg\n* Oldenburg\n* Osnabrück\n* Vechta\n |\n| Mecklenburg-Vorpommern | * Greifswald\n* Rostock\n |\n| North Rhine-Westphalia | * Aachen\n* Bielefeld\n* Bochum\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHeidelberg is one of the most prestigious universities in Germany.[6] It is a German Excellence University, part of the U15, as well as a founding member of the League of European Research Universities and the Coimbra Group. The university consists of twelve faculties and offers degree programmes at undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral levels in some 100 disciplines.[7] The language of instruction is usually German, while a considerable number of graduate degrees are offered in English as well as some in French.[8][9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs a consequence of the disturbances caused by the French Revolution, and particularly because of the Treaty of Lunéville, the university lost all its property on the left bank of the Rhine, so that its complete dissolution was expected.[31]\n\n\n\n### 19th and early 20th century[edit]\n\n\nThis decline did not stop until 1803, when the university was reestablished as a state-owned institution by Karl Friedrich, Grand Duke of Baden, to whom the part of the Palatinate situated on the right bank of the Rhine was allotted. Since then, the university bears his name together with the name of Ruprecht I. Karl Friedrich divided the university into five faculties and placed himself at its head as rector, as did also his successors. During this decade, Romanticism found expression in Heidelberg through Clemens Brentano, Achim von Arnim, Ludwig Tieck, Joseph Görres, and Joseph von Eichendorff, and there went forth a revival of the German Middle Ages in speech, poetry, and art.[28]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHeidelberg University| *Ruprecht-Karls-Universität Heidelberg*\n |\n| ![](image)Seal of the *Ruperto Carola Heidelbergensis*\n |\n| Motto | **Semper apertus** (Latin)[1] |\n| Motto in English\n | Always open |\n| Type | Public |\n| Established | 18 October 1386; 637 years ago (18 October 1386) |\n| Budget | €764.9 million (2018)[2] |\n| Chancellor | Holger Schroeter |\n| President | Bernhard Eitel |\n| Administrative staff\n | 8,397[3] |\n| Students | 28,653 (WS2019/20)[4] |\n| Undergraduates | 15,289[5] |\n| Postgraduates | 11,871[5] |\n| Doctoral students\n | 3,024[5] |\n| Location | Heidelberg\n, Baden-Württemberg\n, Germany\n49°24′37″N 8°42′23″E﻿ / ﻿49.41028°N 8.70639°E﻿ / 49.41028; 8.70639 |\n| Campus | Urban/University town and suburban |\n| Colors | Sandstone red and gold    |\n| Affiliations | German Universities Excellence Initiative, LERU, Coimbra Group, U15, EUA |\n| Website | uni-heidelberg.de/en ![Edit this at Wikidata](image) |\n| ![](image) |\n| Data as of 2013[update] |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDuring the late 19th century, the university housed a very liberal and open-minded spirit, which was deliberately fostered by Max Weber, Ernst Troeltsch and a circle of colleagues around them.\n\n\nIn February 1900, the Grand Duchy of Baden issued a decree that gave women the right to access universities in Baden. Thus, the universities of Freiburg and Heidelberg were the first ones to allow women to study.\n\n\nIn the Weimar Republic, the university was widely recognized as a center of democratic thinking, coined by professors like Karl Jaspers, Gustav Radbruch, Martin Dibelius and Alfred Weber.[28] Unfortunately, there were also dark forces working within the university: Nazi physicist Philipp Lenard was head of the physical institute during that time. Following the assassination of the liberal German-Jewish Foreign Minister Walther Rathenau, he refused to half mast the national flag on the institute, thereby provoking its storming by communist students.[29]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMeanwhile, the university itself continued to lose in prestige until the reign of the last elector Charles Theodore, Elector Palatine, who established new chairs for all the faculties, founded scientific institutes such as the Electoral Academy of Science, and transferred the school of political economy from Kaiserslautern to Heidelberg, where it was combined with the university as the faculty of political economy. He also founded an observatory in the neighboring city of Mannheim, where Jesuit Christian Mayer labored as director. In connection with the four hundredth anniversary of the university, the elector approved a revised statute book that several professors had been commissioned to prepare. The financial affairs of the university, its receipts and expenditures, were put in order. At that time, the number of students varied from 300 to 400; in the jubilee year, 133 matriculated.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPhilosophers Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Karl Jaspers, Hans-Georg Gadamer, and Jürgen Habermas served as university professors, as did also the pioneering scientists Hermann von Helmholtz, Robert Wilhelm Bunsen, Gustav Robert Kirchhoff, Emil Kraepelin, the founder of scientific psychiatry, and outstanding social scientists such as Max Weber, the founding father of modern sociology.\n\n\nPresent faculty include Medicine Nobel Laureates Bert Sakmann (1991) and Harald zur Hausen (2008), Chemistry Nobel Laureate Stefan Hell (2014), seven Leibniz laureates, former justice of the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany Paul Kirchhof, and Rüdiger Wolfrum, the former president of the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea.\n\n\n\n## In fiction and popular culture[edit]\n\n\n### Literature[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe university has its own museum, in the main building of the old campus. Visitors are able to view the Great Hall (when not in use), and the former \"student jail\".[52]\n\n\n\n## Organization[edit]\n\n\n### Governance[edit]\n\n\nThe Rectorate is the 'executive body' of the university, headed by rector Bernhard Eitel. The rectorate consists of the chancellor, Holger Schroeter, who is the head of the central administration and responsible for the university's budgeting, and three pro-rectors, who are responsible for international relations, teaching and communication, and research and structure respectively.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n7. **^** The university does not include departments of business, visual arts, and engineering, except for computer engineering.

In 1948 the freely elected student council was disbanded and replaced by Free German Youth members. The chairman of the Student Council, Wolfgang Natonek, and other members were arrested and imprisoned, but the university was also a nucleus of resistance. Thus began the Belter group, with flyers for free elections. The head of the group, Herbert Belter, was executed in 1951 in Moscow. The German Democratic Republic was created in 1949, and in 1953 for Karl Marx Year the university was renamed by its government the **Karl Marx University, Leipzig** after Karl Marx. In 1968, the partly damaged Augusteum, including Johanneum and Albertinum and the intact Paulinerkirche, were demolished to make way for a redevelopment of the university, carried out between 1973 and 1978. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nUniversity in Leipzig, Germany\n\n\n\nLeipzig University| Universität Leipzig\n |\n| ![](image)Seal of Leipzig University\n |\n| Latin: *Universitas Lipsiensis* |\n| Motto | Aus Tradition Grenzen überschreiten (German)\n |\n| Motto in English\n | Crossing boundaries out of tradition |\n| Type | Public research university |\n| Established | 2 December 1409; 614 years ago (1409-12-02) |\n| Budget | € 408.9 million[1] |\n| Rector | Eva Inés Obergfell |\n| Academic staff\n | 3,234[1] |\n| Administrative staff\n | 1,962[1] |\n| Students | 29,459[2] |\n| Location | Leipzig\n, Saxony\n, Germany\n51°20′20″N 12°22′43″E﻿ / ﻿51.33889°N 12.37861°E﻿ / 51.33889; 12.37861 |\n| Campus | Urban |\n| Colours |   Red \n   Light Blue |\n| Affiliations | Utrecht NetworkGerman U15 |\n| Website | www.uni-leipzig.de |\n| ![](image) |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Official website of Leipzig University\n* History of the Leipzig University\n* Herbermann, Charles, ed.
