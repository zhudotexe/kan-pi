Many molecular and cellular changes involved in the development of cancer accumulate during the aging process and eventually manifest as cancer.[11]\n\n\n\n\n## Genetics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cancer syndrome\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n17. **^** Irigaray P, Newby JA, Clapp R, Hardell L, Howard V, Montagnier L, Epstein S, Belpomme D (December 2007). \"Lifestyle-related factors and environmental agents causing cancer: an overview\". *Biomedicine & Pharmacotherapy*. **61** (10): 640\u201358. doi:10.1016/j.biopha.2007.10.006.

Some types of cancer, like testicular cancer, have early-life incidence peaks, for reasons unknown. Besides, the rate of age-related increase in cancer incidence varies between cancer types with, for instance, prostate cancer incidence accelerating much faster than brain cancer.[12] It has been proposed that the age distribution of cancer incidence can be viewed as the distribution of probability to accumulate the required number of driver events by the given age.[13][14]\n\n\nOver a third of cancer deaths worldwide (and about 75-80% of cancers in the United States[15]) are due to potentially modifiable risk factors. The leading modifiable risk factors worldwide are:[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nObservational epidemiological studies that show associations between risk factors and specific cancers mostly serve to generate hypotheses about potential interventions that could reduce cancer incidence or morbidity. Randomized controlled trials then test whether hypotheses generated by epidemiological studies and laboratory research actually result in reduced cancer incidence and mortality. In many cases, findings from observational epidemiological studies are not confirmed by randomized controlled trials.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Risk factors[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)The approximate relative levels of the preventable causes of cancer in the United States, taken from the article Cancer prevention.\nThe most significant risk factor is age. According to cancer researcher Robert A. Weinberg, \"If we lived long enough, sooner or later we all would get cancer.\"[11] Essentially all of the increase in cancer rates between prehistoric times and people who died in England between 1901 and 1905 is due to increased lifespans.[11]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOther lifestyle and environmental factors known to affect cancer risk (either beneficially or detrimentally) include the use of exogenous hormones (e.g., hormone replacement therapy causes breast cancer), exposure to ionizing radiation and ultraviolet radiation, and certain occupational and chemical exposures.[*citation needed*] A Western diet is associated with increased exposure of the gastrointestinal tract to bile acids that are produced by the body to digest fatty foods. Bile acids are likely endogenous etiologic agents in gastrointestinal cancer.[17]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n14. **^** Belikov, Aleksey V.; Vyatkin, Alexey; Leonov, Sergey V.
