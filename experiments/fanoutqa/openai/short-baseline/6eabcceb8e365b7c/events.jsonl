A former mascot of the team, Cool-kun, who was a penguin, was Mar-kun's friend and rival. He was retired by the team in 2016.[4] |\n| Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks | Hawk Family\n | The SoftBank Hawks have the most mascots of any NPB team, with 11, 9 of which being part of the Hawk Family. These mascots are Harry Hawk, the main mascot, Honey Hawk, his girlfriend (formerly a huge fan of him when Daiei owned the team) and the namesake of Honeys, the club's cheerleading squad, Herculy Hawk, his longstanding rival, Honky Hawk, his uncle, Helen Hawk, Honkey's wife, Hack, Rick and Hock Hawk, his nephews, and Homer Hawk, his older brother and the former main mascot when the club was owned by Daiei.[5] |\n| Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters | Frep the Fox, Polly Polaris, Brisky the Bear, Cubby the Bear\n | An anthropomorphic Ezo red fox, brown squirrel, and black and brown bear.

They were both introduced in 2011.[7] |\n| Saitama Seibu Lions | Leo and Lina\n | Two anthropomorphic white lions, based on Kimba the White Lion, although series creator Osamu Tezuka said Leo was based on Caesar (or Panja as he is known in Japan).\n |\n| Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles | Clutch, Clutchyna, Switch\n | Clutch and Clutchyna are both anthropomorphic golden eagles, whilst Switch is an anthropomorphic harpy eagle from California.[8] |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Central League** |\n| Team\n | Mascot(s)\n | Description\n |\n| Chunichi Dragons | Doala, Shaolon, Paolon\n | An anthropomorphic blue koala, and 2 dragons.

Tsubakuro is the main mascot, Tsubami is his younger sister, and Torukuya is his younger brother. As aforementioned, Tsubakuro is friends with Doala.

Both of them were introduced in 2011, when DeNA bought the club.\n |\n| Yomiuri Giants | Giabbits\n | Consisting of 6 rabbits, as the Giants' cap logo would look like a rabbit.
