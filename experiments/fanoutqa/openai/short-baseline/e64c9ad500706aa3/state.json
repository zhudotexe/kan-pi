K. Rowling is the best-selling book series in history. The first novel in the series, *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*, has sold in excess of 120 million copies,[14] making it one of the best-selling books of all time. As of June 2017, the series has been translated into 85 languages,[15] placing *Harry Potter* among history's most translated literary works. The last four books in the series consecutively set records as the fastest-selling books of all time, and the final installment, *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows*, sold roughly fifteen million copies worldwide within twenty-four hours of its release.[16][17] With twelve million books printed in the first US run, it also holds the record for the highest initial print run for any book in history.[18][19]\n\n\n\n\n## Key[edit]\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Nonfiction\n\n\n\n## List of best-selling individual books[edit]\n\n\n### More than 100 million copies[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMany books lack comprehensive sales figures as book selling and reselling figures prior to the introduction of point of sale equipment was based on the estimates of book sellers, publishers or the authors themselves. For example, *The Lord of the Rings* as one text was recorded to have sold only 967,466 copies in the UK by 2009, but at the same time the author's estate claimed global sales figures of in excess of 150 million.[8] As such accurate figures are only available from the 1990s and in western nations such as US, UK and Australia.
