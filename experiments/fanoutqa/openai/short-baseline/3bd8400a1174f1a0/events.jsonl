Yale Law professor George Priest recommended Kavanaugh to Kozinski, who was regarded as a feeder judge.[40] Kavanaugh interviewed for a clerkship with Chief Justice William Rehnquist of the U.S. Supreme Court during the 1992 term, but was not offered a clerkship.[40]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAlso at Kirkland & Ellis, Kavanaugh authored two amicus briefs to the Supreme Court that supported religious activities and expressions in public places.[60] The first, in *Santa Fe Independent School District v. Doe* (2000), argued that a student speaker at football games voted for by a majority of students should be treated as private speech in a limited public forum; the second, in *Good News Club v. Milford Central School*, argued that a Christian Bible instruction program should have the same after-school access to school facilities as other non-curriculum-related student groups.[61]\n\n\n\n### Federalist Society[edit]\n\n\nKavanaugh has been a member of the Federalist Society since 1988.[62][63] In the administration of George W.

Bush and White House staffers\n### Clerkships[edit]\n\n\nKavanaugh served as a law clerk for Judge Walter King Stapleton of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit from 1990 to 1991.[40] During his clerkship, Stapleton wrote the majority opinion in *Planned Parenthood v. Casey*, in which the Third Circuit upheld many of Pennsylvania's abortion restrictions.[40] Kavanaugh then clerked for Judge Alex Kozinski of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit from 1991 to 1992. Yale Law professor George Priest recommended Kavanaugh to Kozinski, who was regarded as a feeder judge.[40] Kavanaugh interviewed for a clerkship with Chief Justice William Rehnquist of the U.S. Supreme Court during the 1992 term, but was not offered a clerkship.[40]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAlso at Kirkland & Ellis, Kavanaugh authored two amicus briefs to the Supreme Court that supported religious activities and expressions in public places.[60] The first, in *Santa Fe Independent School District v. Doe* (2000), argued that a student speaker at football games voted for by a majority of students should be treated as private speech in a limited public forum; the second, in *Good News Club v. Milford Central School*, argued that a Christian Bible instruction program should have the same after-school access to school facilities as other non-curriculum-related student groups.[61]\n\n\n\n### Federalist Society[edit]\n\n\nKavanaugh has been a member of the Federalist Society since 1988.[62][63] In the administration of George W. Bush, he held a key position that involved judicial appointments. Bush judicial nominees who were Federalist Society members included John Roberts and Samuel Alito, both appointed to the Supreme Court, and about half the judges appointed to the courts of appeals.[64]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n28. **^** Bryan, Bob (July 10, 2018). \"Brett Kavanaugh is the latest high-level Trump appointee to come from a single Washington, D.C.-area high school\". *Business Insider*.
