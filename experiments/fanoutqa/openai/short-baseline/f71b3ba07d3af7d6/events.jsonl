Six missions landed humans on the Moon, beginning with Apollo 11 in July 1969, during which Neil Armstrong became the first person to walk on the Moon. Apollo 13 was intended to land; however, it was restricted to a flyby due to a malfunction aboard the spacecraft. All nine crewed missions returned safely to the Earth.\n\n\nWhile the United States focused on the crewed Apollo program, the Soviet Union conducted uncrewed missions that deployed rovers and returned samples to the Earth.

That country was reported by the IDB to have an inflated population of some 242 million by mid-2005, because it had not still processed the final results of the 2000 Indonesian census.[5][6][7][8] There was a similar discrepancy with the relatively recent Ethiopian 2007 census,[9][10] which gave a preliminary result of \"only\" 73,918,505 inhabitants.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* The United Nations Division of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division provides official UN estimates and projections of country populations\n* City population provides demographic data *not* only for cities, but also for countries (and their primary administrative divisions), sometimes going back to the 1980s.\n* GeoHive page with historic, current and future population by country, also based on the United States Census Bureau International Data Base.\n* Population statistics has a collection of demographic statistics from every country and territory, some of them going back *centuries*.\n* Statoids gives historical and present-day census data about countries and territories, and figures for their first (and even second) level administrative divisions.\n* World gazetteer at archive.today (archived 2012-12-04) includes present-day national population projections, going back to the 1990s in some cases.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Country (or dependent territory) | 1985 | % | 1990 | % | 1995 | % | 2000 | % | 2005 | % | 2010 | % | 2015 | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Afghanistan | 13,120 | -2.70 | 13,569 | 0.67 | 19,446 | 7.46 | 22,462 | 2.93 | 26,335 | 3.23 | 29,121 | 2.03 | 32,565 | 2.26\n |\n| ![](image) Albania | 2,957 | 2.05 | 3,245 | 1.88 | 3,159 | -0.54 | 3,159 | 0.00 | 3,025 | -0.86 | 2,987 | -0.25 | 3,030 | 0.28\n |\n| ![](image) Algeria | 22,009 | 3.19 | 25,191 | 2.74 | 28,322 | 2.37 | 30,639 | 1.58 | 32,918 | 1.45 | 35,950 | 1.78 | 39,543 | 1.92\n |\n| ![](image) American Samoa | 39 | 3.57 | 48 | 4.09 | 54 | 2.69 | 58 | 1.39 | 57 | -0.28 | 56 | -0.53 | 55 | -0.41\n |\n| ![](image) Andorra | 45 | 5.84 | 53 | 3.41 | 64 | 3.70 | 66 | 0.58 | 77 | 3.18 | 85 | 2.12 | 86 | 0.25\n |\n| ![](image) Angola | 8,390 | 3.09 | 9,486 | 2.48 | 11,000 | 3.01 | 12,683 | 2.89 | 14,770 | 3.09 | 17,043 | 2.90 | 19,626 | 2.86\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Country (or dependent territory) | 1950 | 1955 | % | 1960 | % | 1965 | % | 1970 | % | 1975 | % | 1980 | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Afghanistan | 8,151 | 8,892 | 1.76 | 9,830 | 2.03 | 10,998 | 2.27 | 12,431 | 2.48 | 14,133 | 2.60 | 15,045 | 1.26\n |\n| ![](image) Albania | 1,228 | 1,393 | 2.56 | 1,624 | 3.12 | 1,884 | 3.02 | 2,157 | 2.74 | 2,402 | 2.17 | 2,672 | 2.16\n |\n| ![](image) Algeria | 8,893 | 9,842 | 2.05 | 10,910 | 2.08 | 11,964 | 1.86 | 13,932 | 3.09 | 16,141 | 2.99 | 18,807 | 3.10\n |\n| ![](image) American Samoa | 20 | 20 | 0.72 | 21 | 0.20 | 25 | 4.23 | 28 | 2.08 | 30 | 1.68 | 33 | 1.80\n |\n| ![](image) Andorra | 7 | 7 | 0.04 | 9 | 6.28 | 14 | 10.17 | 20 | 7.49 | 27 | 6.32 | 34 | 4.81\n |\n| ![](image) Angola | 4,118 | 4,424 | 1.44 | 4,798 | 1.64 | 5,135 | 1.37 | 5,606 | 1.77 | 6,051 | 1.54 | 7,206 | 3.56\n |\n| ![](image) Anguilla | 6 | 6 | 0.80 | 6 | 0.79 | 6 | 0.75 | 7 | 0.80 | 7 | 0.68 | 7 | 0.64\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHowever, no projected population figures can be considered exact. As the IDB states, \"figures beyond the years 2020-2025 should be taken with caution\", as the \"census way towards those years has yet to be paved\". Thus projections can be said to be looking through a kind of \"cloudy glass\"[1] or a \"misty window\": realistically, the projections are \"guesstimates\".\n\n\nTo make things complicated, not all countries carry out censuses regularly, especially some of the poorer, faster-growing sub-Saharan African nations (whose evolution may be more interesting, from a demographer's point of view, than the \"stagnated\" populations of countries like Germany or Italy). As is well known from the statistics, the population of many sub-Saharan nations, as well as other nations like Egypt, Iraq, and Pakistan, with their low level of family planning, are growing much faster than in the aging European nations or Japan. \n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_Nff3I1ITsuWBSHLVWkbmkUWe","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

That country was reported by the IDB to have an inflated population of some 242 million by mid-2005, because it had not still processed the final results of the 2000 Indonesian census.[5][6][7][8] There was a similar discrepancy with the relatively recent Ethiopian 2007 census,[9][10] which gave a preliminary result of \"only\" 73,918,505 inhabitants.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* The United Nations Division of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division provides official UN estimates and projections of country populations\n* City population provides demographic data *not* only for cities, but also for countries (and their primary administrative divisions), sometimes going back to the 1980s.\n* GeoHive page with historic, current and future population by country, also based on the United States Census Bureau International Data Base.\n* Population statistics has a collection of demographic statistics from every country and territory, some of them going back *centuries*.\n* Statoids gives historical and present-day census data about countries and territories, and figures for their first (and even second) level administrative divisions.\n* World gazetteer at archive.today (archived 2012-12-04) includes present-day national population projections, going back to the 1990s in some cases.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Country (or dependent territory) | 1985 | % | 1990 | % | 1995 | % | 2000 | % | 2005 | % | 2010 | % | 2015 | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Afghanistan | 13,120 | -2.70 | 13,569 | 0.67 | 19,446 | 7.46 | 22,462 | 2.93 | 26,335 | 3.23 | 29,121 | 2.03 | 32,565 | 2.26\n |\n| ![](image) Albania | 2,957 | 2.05 | 3,245 | 1.88 | 3,159 | -0.54 | 3,159 | 0.00 | 3,025 | -0.86 | 2,987 | -0.25 | 3,030 | 0.28\n |\n| ![](image) Algeria | 22,009 | 3.19 | 25,191 | 2.74 | 28,322 | 2.37 | 30,639 | 1.58 | 32,918 | 1.45 | 35,950 | 1.78 | 39,543 | 1.92\n |\n| ![](image) American Samoa | 39 | 3.57 | 48 | 4.09 | 54 | 2.69 | 58 | 1.39 | 57 | -0.28 | 56 | -0.53 | 55 | -0.41\n |\n| ![](image) Andorra | 45 | 5.84 | 53 | 3.41 | 64 | 3.70 | 66 | 0.58 | 77 | 3.18 | 85 | 2.12 | 86 | 0.25\n |\n| ![](image) Angola | 8,390 | 3.09 | 9,486 | 2.48 | 11,000 | 3.01 | 12,683 | 2.89 | 14,770 | 3.09 | 17,043 | 2.90 | 19,626 | 2.86\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Country (or dependent territory) | 1950 | 1955 | % | 1960 | % | 1965 | % | 1970 | % | 1975 | % | 1980 | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Afghanistan | 8,151 | 8,892 | 1.76 | 9,830 | 2.03 | 10,998 | 2.27 | 12,431 | 2.48 | 14,133 | 2.60 | 15,045 | 1.26\n |\n| ![](image) Albania | 1,228 | 1,393 | 2.56 | 1,624 | 3.12 | 1,884 | 3.02 | 2,157 | 2.74 | 2,402 | 2.17 | 2,672 | 2.16\n |\n| ![](image) Algeria | 8,893 | 9,842 | 2.05 | 10,910 | 2.08 | 11,964 | 1.86 | 13,932 | 3.09 | 16,141 | 2.99 | 18,807 | 3.10\n |\n| ![](image) American Samoa | 20 | 20 | 0.72 | 21 | 0.20 | 25 | 4.23 | 28 | 2.08 | 30 | 1.68 | 33 | 1.80\n |\n| ![](image) Andorra | 7 | 7 | 0.04 | 9 | 6.28 | 14 | 10.17 | 20 | 7.49 | 27 | 6.32 | 34 | 4.81\n |\n| ![](image) Angola | 4,118 | 4,424 | 1.44 | 4,798 | 1.64 | 5,135 | 1.37 | 5,606 | 1.77 | 6,051 | 1.54 | 7,206 | 3.56\n |\n| ![](image) Anguilla | 6 | 6 | 0.80 | 6 | 0.79 | 6 | 0.75 | 7 | 0.80 | 7 | 0.68 | 7 | 0.64\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHowever, no projected population figures can be considered exact. As the IDB states, \"figures beyond the years 2020-2025 should be taken with caution\", as the \"census way towards those years has yet to be paved\". Thus projections can be said to be looking through a kind of \"cloudy glass\"[1] or a \"misty window\": realistically, the projections are \"guesstimates\".\n\n\nTo make things complicated, not all countries carry out censuses regularly, especially some of the poorer, faster-growing sub-Saharan African nations (whose evolution may be more interesting, from a demographer's point of view, than the \"stagnated\" populations of countries like Germany or Italy). As is well known from the statistics, the population of many sub-Saharan nations, as well as other nations like Egypt, Iraq, and Pakistan, with their low level of family planning, are growing much faster than in the aging European nations or Japan. \n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_Nff3I1ITsuWBSHLVWkbmkUWe","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
