This includes spires and architectural details but does not include antenna masts. Only completed buildings and under-construction buildings that have been topped out are included.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBengaluru is witnessing a huge high-rise boom with many skyscrapers being built in different parts of the city. Being the technology capital of India makes it one of the fastest growing mega cities in the world. The influx of high-skilled individuals from all parts of India come here for job and business opportunities. This is the reason why there is always demand for office and living space within the city and as a result Bengaluru is moving towards vertical development. CNTC Presidential Tower (topped-out in early 2023) is currently the tallest building in the city. It is 161 metres (528 ft) tall and has 50 floors. The World Trade Center (topped out in 2010) is currently the tallest commercial building in the city. It is 128 metres (420 ft) tall and has 32 floors. The World Trade Center, the UB Tower, the Mantri DSK Pinnacle, and Phoenix One Bangalore West are some of the various prominent skyscrapers in the city. \n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
