Such dice are commonly referred to as d*n* where *n* is the number of faces (d8, d20, etc.); see dice notation for more details.\n\n\nThese shapes frequently show up in other games or puzzles. Puzzles similar to a Rubik's Cube come in all five shapes \u2013 see magic polyhedra.\n\n\n\n### Liquid crystals with symmetries of Platonic solids[edit]\n\n\nFor the intermediate material phase called liquid crystals, the existence of such symmetries was first proposed in 1981 by H. Kleinert and K. Maki.[12][13]\nIn aluminum the icosahedral structure was discovered three years after this by Dan Shechtman, which earned him the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2011.\n\n\n\n## Related polyhedra and polytopes[edit]\n\n\n### Uniform polyhedra[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nConvex polyhedron with identical, regular polygon faces\n\nIn geometry, a **Platonic solid** is a convex, regular polyhedron in three-dimensional Euclidean space. Being a regular polyhedron means that the faces are congruent (identical in shape and size) regular polygons (all angles congruent and all edges congruent), and the same number of faces meet at each vertex. There are only five such polyhedra:\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Tetrahedron | Cube | Octahedron | Dodecahedron | Icosahedron |\n| Four faces\n | Six faces\n | Eight faces\n | Twelve faces\n | Twenty faces\n |\n| ![](image)\n(Animation, 3D model)\n | ![](image)\n(Animation, 3D model)\n | ![](image)\n(Animation, 3D model)\n | ![](image)\n(Animation, 3D model)\n | ![](image)\n(Animation, 3D model)\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n1. Each vertex of the solid must be a vertex for at least three faces.\n2. At each vertex of the solid, the total, among the adjacent faces, of the angles between their respective adjacent sides must be strictly less than 360\u00b0. The amount less than 360\u00b0 is called an angle defect.\n3. Regular polygons of six or more sides have only angles of 120\u00b0 or more, so the common face must be the triangle, square, or pentagon. For these different shapes of faces the following holds:\nTriangular faces\nEach vertex of a regular triangle is 60\u00b0, so a shape may have three, four, or five triangles meeting at a vertex; these are the tetrahedron, octahedron, and icosahedron respectively.\nSquare faces\nEach vertex of a square is 90\u00b0, so there is only one arrangement possible with three faces at a vertex, the cube.\nPentagonal faces\nEach vertex is 108\u00b0; again, only one arrangement of three faces at a vertex is possible, the dodecahedron.\nAltogether this makes five possible Platonic solids.\n\n### Topological proof[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the mid-19th century the Swiss mathematician Ludwig Schl\u00e4fli discovered the four-dimensional analogues of the Platonic solids, called convex regular 4-polytopes. There are exactly six of these figures; five are analogous to the Platonic solids\u00a0: 5-cell as {3,3,3}, 16-cell as {3,3,4}, 600-cell as {3,3,5}, tesseract as {4,3,3}, and 120-cell as {5,3,3}, and a sixth one, the self-dual 24-cell, {3,4,3}.\n\n\nIn all dimensions higher than four, there are only three convex regular polytopes: the simplex as {3,3,...,3}, the hypercube as {4,3,...,3}, and the cross-polytope as {3,3,...,4}.[14] In three dimensions, these coincide with the tetrahedron as {3,3}, the cube as {4,3}, and the octahedron as {3,4}.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Archimedean solid\n* Catalan solid\n* Deltahedron\n* Johnson solid\n* Goldberg solid\n* Kepler solids\n* List of regular polytopes\n* Prince Rupert's cube\n* Regular polytopes\n* Regular skew polyhedron\n* Toroidal polyhedron\n\n## Citations[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGeometers have studied the Platonic solids for thousands of years.[1] They are named for the ancient Greek philosopher Plato who hypothesized in one of his dialogues, the *Timaeus*, that the classical elements were made of these regular solids.[2]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kepler's Platonic solid model of the Solar System from *Mysterium Cosmographicum* (1596)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nAssignment to the elements in Kepler's *Mysterium Cosmographicum*\n\nThe Platonic solids have been known since antiquity. It has been suggested that certain carved stone balls created by the late Neolithic people of Scotland represent these shapes; however, these balls have rounded knobs rather than being polyhedral, the numbers of knobs frequently differed from the numbers of vertices of the Platonic solids, there is no ball whose knobs match the 20 vertices of the dodecahedron, and the arrangement of the knobs was not always symmetric.[3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThese coordinates reveal certain relationships between the Platonic solids: the vertices of the tetrahedron represent half of those of the cube, as {4,3} or ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image), one of two sets of 4 vertices in dual positions, as h{4,3} or ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image). Both tetrahedral positions make the compound stellated octahedron.\n\n\nThe coordinates of the icosahedron are related to two alternated sets of coordinates of a nonuniform truncated octahedron, t{3,4} or ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image), also called a *snub octahedron*, as s{3,4} or ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image), and seen in the compound of two icosahedra.\n\n\nEight of the vertices of the dodecahedron are shared with the cube. Completing all orientations leads to the compound of five cubes.\n\n\n\n## Combinatorial properties[edit]\n\n\nA convex polyhedron is a Platonic solid if and only if all three of the following requirements are met.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* *Platonic solids* at Encyclopaedia of Mathematics\n* Weisstein, Eric W. \"Platonic solid\". *MathWorld*.\n* Weisstein, Eric W. \"Isohedron\". *MathWorld*.\n* Book XIII of Euclid's *Elements*.\n* Interactive 3D Polyhedra in Java\n* Platonic Solids in Visual Polyhedra\n* Solid Body Viewer is an interactive 3D polyhedron viewer which allows you to save the model in svg, stl or obj format.\n* Interactive Folding/Unfolding Platonic Solids Archived 2007-02-09 at the Wayback Machine in Java\n* Paper models of the Platonic solids created using nets generated by Stella software\n* Platonic Solids Free paper models (nets)\n* Grime, James; Steckles, Katie. \"Platonic Solids\". *Numberphile*.

This pair {*p*,\u00a0*q*}, called the Schl\u00e4fli symbol, gives a combinatorial description of the polyhedron. The Schl\u00e4fli symbols of the five Platonic solids are given in the table below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe next most regular convex polyhedra after the Platonic solids are the cuboctahedron, which is a rectification of the cube and the octahedron, and the icosidodecahedron, which is a rectification of the dodecahedron and the icosahedron (the rectification of the self-dual tetrahedron is a regular octahedron). These are both *quasi-regular*, meaning that they are vertex- and edge-uniform and have regular faces, but the faces are not all congruent (coming in two different classes). They form two of the thirteen Archimedean solids, which are the convex uniform polyhedra with polyhedral symmetry. Their duals, the rhombic dodecahedron and rhombic triacontahedron, are edge- and face-transitive, but their faces are not regular and their vertices come in two types each; they are two of the thirteen Catalan solids.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe classical result is that only five convex regular polyhedra exist. Two common arguments below demonstrate no more than five Platonic solids can exist, but positively demonstrating the existence of any given solid is a separate question\u2014one that requires an explicit construction.\n\n\n\n### Geometric proof[edit]\n\n\n\n\nPolygon nets around a vertex\n| ![](image){3,3}Defect 180\u00b0\n | ![](image){3,4}Defect 120\u00b0\n | ![](image){3,5}Defect 60\u00b0\n | ![](image){3,6}Defect 0\u00b0\n |\n| ![](image){4,3}Defect 90\u00b0\n | ![](image){4,4}Defect 0\u00b0\n | ![](image){5,3}Defect 36\u00b0\n | ![](image){6,3}Defect 0\u00b0\n |\n| A vertex needs at least 3 faces, and an angle defect. A 0\u00b0 angle defect will fill the Euclidean plane with a regular tiling. By Descartes' theorem, the number of vertices is 720\u00b0/*defect*.\n |\n\n\nThe following geometric argument is very similar to the one given by Euclid in the *Elements*:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![{\\displaystyle \\varphi =2\\cos {\\pi  \\over 5}={\\frac {1+{\\sqrt {5}}}{2}},\\qquad \\xi =2\\sin {\\pi  \\over 5}={\\sqrt {\\frac {5-{\\sqrt {5}}}{2}}}={\\sqrt {3-\\varphi }}.}](image)\nAmong the Platonic solids, either the dodecahedron or the icosahedron may be seen as the best approximation to the sphere. The icosahedron has the largest number of faces and the largest dihedral angle, it hugs its inscribed sphere the most tightly, and its surface area to volume ratio is closest to that of a sphere of the same size (i.e. either the same surface area or the same volume). The dodecahedron, on the other hand, has the smallest angular defect, the largest vertex solid angle, and it fills out its circumscribed sphere the most.\n\n\n\n### Point in space[edit]\n\n\nFor an arbitrary point in the space of a Platonic solid with circumradius *R*, whose distances to the centroid of the Platonic solid and its *n* vertices are *L* and *di* respectively, and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nS\n\n[\nn\n]\n\n\n(\n2\nm\n)\n\n\n=\n\n\n1\nn\n\n\n\n\u2211\n\ni\n=\n1\n\n\nn\n\n\n\nd\n\ni\n\n\n2\nm\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\nq\n\n\n+\n\n\n1\np\n\n\n>\n\n\n1\n2\n\n\n.\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\frac {1}{q}}+{\\frac {1}{p}}>{\\frac {1}{2}}.}\n\n![{\\displaystyle {\\frac {1}{q}}+{\\frac {1}{p}}>{\\frac {1}{2}}.}](image)\nUsing the fact that *p* and *q* must both be at least 3, one can easily see that there are only five possibilities for {*p*,\u00a0*q*}:\n\n\n\n{3,\u00a03}, {4,\u00a03}, {3,\u00a04}, {5,\u00a03}, {3,\u00a05}.\n## Geometric properties[edit]\n\n\n### Angles[edit]\n\n\nThere are a number of angles associated with each Platonic solid. The dihedral angle is the interior angle between any two face planes.

The high degree of symmetry of the Platonic solids can be interpreted in a number of ways. Most importantly, the vertices of each solid are all equivalent under the action of the symmetry group, as are the edges and faces. One says the action of the symmetry group is transitive on the vertices, edges, and faces. In fact, this is another way of defining regularity of a polyhedron: a polyhedron is *regular* if and only if it is vertex-uniform, edge-uniform, and face-uniform.\n\n\nThere are only three symmetry groups associated with the Platonic solids rather than five, since the symmetry group of any polyhedron coincides with that of its dual. This is easily seen by examining the construction of the dual polyhedron. Any symmetry of the original must be a symmetry of the dual and vice versa. The three polyhedral groups are:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

The only other common non-cubical die is the 10-sided die, a pentagonal trapezohedron die, whose faces are ten kites, each with two different edge lengths, three different angles, and two different kinds of vertices. Such sets frequently include a second 10-sided die either of contrasting color or numbered by tens, allowing the pair of 10-sided dice to be combined to generate numbers between 1 and 100.\n\n\nUsing these dice in various ways, games can closely approximate a variety of probability distributions. For instance, 10-sided dice can be rolled in pairs to produce a uniform distribution of random percentages, and summing the values of multiple dice will produce approximations to normal distributions.[29]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | Pentagonal prism | ![](image) | Similar in constitution to the 5-sided die. Seven-sided dice are used in a seven-player variant of backgammon.

A pair of common dice is usual, though other forms of polyhedra can be used. Tibetan Buddhists sometimes use this method of divination. It is highly likely that the Pythagoreans used the Platonic solids as dice. They referred to such dice as \"the dice of the gods\" and they sought to understand the universe through an understanding of geometry in polyhedra.[37]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 120\n | Disdyakis triacontahedron | ![](image) | Each face is a scalene triangle.\n |\n\n\n### Non-numeric dice[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A set of Fudge dice\nThe faces of most dice are labelled using sequences of whole numbers, usually starting at one, expressed with either pips or digits. However, there are some applications that require results other than numbers. Examples include letters for Boggle, directions for *Warhammer Fantasy Battle*, Fudge dice, playing card symbols for poker dice, and instructions for sexual acts using sex dice.\n\n\n\n### Alternatively-numbered dice[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe modern tradition of using *sets* of polyhedral dice started around the end of the 1960s when non-cubical dice became popular among players of wargames,[28] and since have been employed extensively in role-playing games and trading card games. Dice using both the numerals 6 and 9, which are reciprocally symmetric through rotation, typically distinguish them with a dot or underline.\n\n\n\n#### Common variations[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Isohedron\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | Rounded rhombicuboctahedron | ![](image) | Eighteen faces are squares.

The weight will settle in one of the points of the internal cavity, causing it to settle with one of the numbers uppermost. For instance, a sphere with an octahedral cavity and a small internal weight will settle with one of the 6 points of the cavity held downwards by the weight.\n\n\n\n## Applications[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDice may have numbers that do not form a counting sequence starting at one. One variation on the standard die is known as the \"average\" die.[34][35] These are six-sided dice with sides numbered `2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5`, which have the same arithmetic mean as a standard die (3.5 for a single die, 7 for a pair of dice), but have a narrower range of possible values (2 through 5 for one, 4 through 10 for a pair). They are used in some table-top wargames, where a narrower range of numbers is required.[35] Other numbered variations include Sicherman dice and intransitive dice.\n\n\n\n### Spherical dice[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Triangular prism | ![](image) | A prism that is thin enough to land either on its \"edge\" or \"face\".

They are used for generating random values, commonly as part of tabletop games, including dice games, board games, role-playing games, and games of chance.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLong dice and teetotums can in principle be made with any number of faces, including odd numbers.[31] Long dice are based on the infinite set of prisms. All the rectangular faces are mutually face-transitive, so they are equally probable. The two ends of the prism may be rounded or capped with a pyramid, designed so that the die cannot rest on those faces. 4-sided long dice are easier to roll than tetrahedra, and are used in the traditional board games dayakattai and dald\u00f8s.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA loaded, weighted, cheat, or crooked die is one that has been tampered with so that it will land with a specific side facing upwards more or less often than a fair die would. There are several methods for making loaded dice, including rounded faces, off-square faces, and weights. Casinos and gambling halls frequently use transparent cellulose acetate dice as tampering is easier to detect than with opaque dice.[27]\n\n\n\n## Variants[edit]\n\n\n### Polyhedral dice[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A typical set of polyhedral dice in various colors. They consist of the five Platonic solids, along with a ten-sided die that is also used for generating percentages.\nVarious shapes like two-sided or four-sided dice are documented in archaeological findings; for example, from Ancient Egypt and the Middle East. While the cubical six-sided die became the most common type in many parts of the world, other shapes were always known, like 20-sided dice in Ptolemaic and Roman times. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA traditional die is a cube with each of its six faces marked with a different number of dots (pips) from one to six. When thrown or rolled, the die comes to rest showing a random integer from one to six on its upper surface, with each value being equally likely. Dice may also have polyhedral or irregular shapes, may have faces marked with numerals or symbols instead of pips and may have their numbers carved out from the material of the dice instead of marked on it. Loaded dice are designed to favor some results over others for cheating or entertainment.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Hexagonal bipyramid | ![](image) | Each face is an isosceles triangle.\n |\n| 13\n | Truncated Sphere\n | ![](image) | A truncated sphere with thirteen landing positions.

A die roll is made random by uncertainty in minor factors such as tiny movements in the thrower's hand; they are thus a crude form of hardware random number generator. \n\n\nOne typical contemporary dice game is craps, where two dice are thrown simultaneously and wagers are made on the total value of the two dice. Dice are frequently used to introduce randomness into board games, where they are often used to decide the distance through which a piece will move along the board (as in backgammon and *Monopoly*).\n\n\n\n## Construction[edit]\n\n\n### Arrangement[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Chirality of dice. Faces may be placed counterclockwise (top) *or* clockwise.\nCommon dice are small cubes, most often 1.6\u00a0cm (0.63\u00a0in) across, whose faces are numbered from one to six, usually by patterns of round dots called pips. (While the use of Arabic numerals is occasionally seen, such dice are less common.)\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
