If passport holders must get government approval before leaving in order to obtain a visa on arrival, this also scores 0.\n6. The score for each passport is then totalled by adding up its scores for all destinations.[17]\n7. The index ignores temporary restrictions or airspace closures.[18]\n8. It considers mobility data based on national GDPs and the percentage of global wealth that the country's passport could provide access to.[19]\n\n\n## Rankings[edit]\n\n\n### 2023 Henley Passport Index[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 2023rank | Passport issuing country | Visa-freedestinations\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | ![](image) Singapore | 193 |\n| 2\n | ![](image) Japan | 191 |\n| 3\n | ![](image) Finland | 190 |\n| ![](image) France | 190 |\n| ![](image) Germany | 190 |\n| ![](image) Italy | 190 |\n| ![](image) South Korea | 190 |\n| ![](image) Spain | 190 |\n| ![](image) Sweden | 190 |\n| 4 | ![](image) Austria | 189 |\n| ![](image) Denmark | 189 |\n| ![](image) Ireland | 189 |\n| ![](image) Luxembourg | 189 |\n| ![](image) Netherlands | 189 |\n| ![](image) United Kingdom | 189 |\n| 5 | ![](image) Belgium | 188 |\n| ![](image) Malta | 188 |\n| ![](image) Portugal | 188 |\n| ![](image) Norway | 188 |\n| 6\n | ![](image) Czech Republic | 187 |\n| ![](image) New Zealand | 187 |\n| ![](image) Poland | 187 |\n| ![](image)  Switzerland | 187 |\n| 7\n | ![](image) Australia | 186 |\n| ![](image) Canada | 186 |\n| ![](image) Greece | 186 |\n| ![](image) Hungary | 186 |\n| ![](image) United States | 186 |\n| 8\n | ![](image) Lithuania | 185 |\n| 9\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 2022rank[27] | Passport issuing country | Visa-freedestinations\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | ![](image) Japan | 193 |\n| 2 | ![](image) Singapore | 192 |\n| ![](image) South Korea | 192 |\n| 4 | ![](image) Germany | 190 |\n| ![](image) Spain | 190 |\n| 6 | ![](image) Finland | 189 |\n| ![](image) Italy | 189 |\n| ![](image) Luxembourg | 189 |\n| 9 | ![](image) Austria | 188 |\n| ![](image) Denmark | 188 |\n| ![](image) Netherlands | 188 |\n| ![](image) Sweden | 188 |\n| 13 | ![](image) France | 187 |\n| ![](image) Ireland | 187 |\n| ![](image) Portugal | 187 |\n| ![](image) United Kingdom | 187 |\n| 17 | ![](image) Belgium | 186 |\n| ![](image) New Zealand | 186 |\n| ![](image) Norway | 186 |\n| ![](image)  Switzerland | 186 |\n| ![](image) United States | 186 |\n| 22 | ![](image) Australia | 185 |\n| ![](image) Canada | 185 |\n| ![](image) Czech Republic | 185 |\n| ![](image) Greece | 185 |\n| ![](image) Malta | 185 |\n| 27 | ![](image) Hungary | 183 |\n| 28 | ![](image) Lithuania | 182 |\n| ![](image) Poland | 182 |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe index annually ranks 199 passports of the world by the number of countries that their holders can travel to without visas.[5] The number of countries that a specific passport can access becomes its visa-free \"score\". In collaboration with the International Air Transport Association (IATA),[6] and using official data from their global database, Henley & Partners has analysed the visa regulations of almost all the world's countries and territories since 2006.[3][7]\n\n\n\n\n## Definition of the Index[edit]\n\n\nThe Henley Passport index (HPI) ranks passports according to the number of destinations that can be reached using a particular country's ordinary passport without the need of a prior visa (\"visa-free\").[8][9] The survey ranks 199 passports against 227 destination[10] countries, territories, and micro-states.[11][12][13]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_k1IRLUwHMMv00sYHSMTUEMR4","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
