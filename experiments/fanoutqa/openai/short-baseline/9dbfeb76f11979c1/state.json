For example, George Washington served two consecutive terms and is counted as the first president (not the first and second). Upon the resignation of 37th president, Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford became the 38th president even though he simply served out the remainder of Nixon's second term and was never elected to the presidency in his own right. Grover Cleveland was both the 22nd president and the 24th president because his two terms were not consecutive. A vice president who temporarily becomes acting president under the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the Constitution is not counted, because the president remains in office during such a period.\n2. **^** Reflects the president's political party at the start of their presidency. Changes during their time in office are noted. Also reflects the vice president's political party unless otherwise noted beside the individual's name.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFour presidents died in office of natural causes (William Henry Harrison, Zachary Taylor, Warren G. Harding, and Franklin D. Roosevelt), four were assassinated (Abraham Lincoln, James A. Garfield, William McKinley, and John F. Kennedy), and one resigned (Richard Nixon, facing impeachment and removal from office).[10] John Tyler was the first vice president to assume the presidency during a presidential term, and set the precedent that a vice president who does so becomes the fully functioning president with his presidency.[11]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n30.

The first president, George Washington, won a unanimous vote of the Electoral College.[4] Grover Cleveland served two non-consecutive terms and is therefore counted as the 22nd and 24th president of the United States, giving rise to the discrepancy between the number of presidencies and the number of individuals who have served as president.[5] The incumbent president is Joe Biden.[6]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Vice presidents | * Age\n* Burial places\n* Coats of arms\n* Education\n* Families\n\t+ spouses\n\t+ children\n* Home state\n* Impeachment efforts\n* Other offices held\n* Ran for president\n* Religious affiliation\n* Slave owners\n* Tie-breaking votes\n* Time in office\n* U.S. Senate bust collection\n |\n| Succession | * Acting presidents\n* Designated survivors\n* Inaugurations\n* Transitions\n |\n| Elections | * Electoral College margin\n* Popular vote margin\n* Winner lost popular vote\n |\n| Candidates | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Political affiliation | * Democratic\n* Democratic-Republican\n* Federalist\n* Green\n* Libertarian\n* National Republican\u00a0/ Whig\n* Republican\n* Third party\u00a0/ independent\n |\n| Distinctions | * African American\n* Campaign slogans\n* Female\n* Firsts\n* Height\n* Lost their home state\n* Number of votes received\n\t+ in primaries\n* Received at least one electoral vote\n* Unsuccessful major party presidential candidates\n* Unsuccessful major party vice presidential candidates\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nPresidents of the United States\n |\n| --- |\n| Presidents andpresidencies | 1.

When they did develop, during Washington's first term, Adams joined the faction that became the Federalist Party. The elections of 1792 were the first ones in the United States that were contested on anything resembling a partisan basis.[18]\n4. **^** The 1796 presidential election was the first contested American presidential election and the only one in which a president and vice president were elected from opposing political parties. Federalist John Adams was elected president, and Jefferson of the Democratic-Republicans was elected vice president.[20]\n5. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** ***k*** ***l*** ***m*** ***n*** ***o*** Died in office[23]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n57. **^** Senate.\n58. **^** Hoff (a) (2000).\n59. **^** Brinkley (2000).\n60. **^** Hamby (2000).\n61. **^** Abbott (2005), p.\u00a0636.\n62. **^** Ambrose (2000).\n63. **^** Parmet (2000).\n64. **^** Gardner (2000).\n65. **^** Abbott (2005), p.\u00a0633.\n66. **^** Hoff (b) (2000).\n67. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Greene (2013).\n68. **^** whitehouse.gov (a).\n69. **^** Schaller (2004).\n70. **^** whitehouse.gov (b).\n71. **^** whitehouse.gov (c).\n72. **^** whitehouse.gov (d).\n73. **^** whitehouse.gov (e).\n74. **^** whitehouse.gov (f).\n\n## Works cited[edit]\n\n\n**General**\n\n\n\n* *Guide to U.S. Elections*.

In instances where a physical structure is absent, a monument or roadside marker has been erected to denote the site's historic significance. All sites in the table below are listed in the National Register of Historic Places.\n\n\nA dramatic shift in childbirth from home to hospital occurred in the United States in the early 20th century (mid\u20131920s to 1940).[4] Reflective of this trend, Jimmy Carter and all presidents born during and after World War II (Bill Clinton and every president since) have been born in a hospital, not a private residence.
