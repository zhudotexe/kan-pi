He drew a distinction between the producers who actually do the work of organizing the production of a show and investing producers who merely help finance it, often late in the award season.[9]\n\n\n\n## EGOT winners[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n22. **^** Chuba, Kirsten (September 10, 2018). \"John Legend, Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice Become Newest EGOTs With Emmy Win\". *Variety*.
