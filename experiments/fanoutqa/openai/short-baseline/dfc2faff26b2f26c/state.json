All such rankings should be used with caution, because it is not possible to devise a coherent set of linguistic criteria for distinguishing languages in a dialect continuum.[1] For example, a language is often defined as a set of mutually intelligible varieties, but independent national standard languages may be considered separate languages even though they are largely mutually intelligible, as in the case of Danish and Norwegian.[2] Conversely, many commonly accepted languages, including German, Italian and even English encompass varieties that are not mutually intelligible.[1] While Arabic is sometimes considered a single language centred on Modern Standard Arabic, other authors consider its mutually unintelligible varieties separate languages.[3] Similarly, Chinese is sometimes viewed as a single language because of a shared culture and common literary language.[4] It is also common to describe various Chinese dialect groups, such as Mandarin, Wu and Yue, as languages, even though each of these groups contains many mutually unintelligible varieties.[5]\n\n\nThere are also difficulties in obtaining reliable counts of speakers, which vary over time because of population change and language shift. In some areas, there is no reliable census data, the data is not current, or the census may not record languages spoken, or record them ambiguously. Sometimes speaker populations are exaggerated for political reasons, or speakers of minority languages may be underreported in favour of a national language.[6]\n\n\n\n\n## Top languages by population[edit]\n\n\n### *Ethnologue* (2023)[edit]\n\n\nThe following languages are listed as having at least 50 million first-language speakers in the 26th edition of *Ethnologue* published in 2023.[7] Entries *Ethnologue* identifies as macrolanguages (such as Arabic, Lahnda, Persian, Malay, Pashto, and Chinese, encompassing all their respective varieties) are not included in this section.\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguages with at least 50 million first-language speakers[7]\n| Language\n | Native speakers(millions) | Language family\n | Branch\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Mandarin Chinese | 939\n | Sino-Tibetan | Sinitic |\n| Spanish | 485\n | Indo-European | Romance |\n| English | 380\n | Indo-European | Germanic |\n| Hindi | 345\n | Indo-European | Indo-Aryan |\n| Portuguese | 236\n | Indo-European | Romance |\n| Bengali | 234\n | Indo-European | Indo-Aryan |\n| Russian | 147\n | Indo-European | Balto-Slavic |\n| Japanese | 123\n | Japonic | Japanese |\n| Yue Chinese | 86.1\n | Sino-Tibetan | Sinitic |\n| Vietnamese | 85.0\n | Austroasiatic | Vietic |\n| Turkish | 84.0\n | Turkic | Oghuz |\n| Wu Chinese | 83.4\n | Sino-Tibetan | Sinitic |\n| Marathi | 83.2\n | Indo-European | Indo-Aryan |\n| Telugu | 83.0\n | Dravidian | South-Central\n |\n| Korean | 81.7\n | Koreanic | \u2014\n |\n| French | 80.8\n | Indo-European | Romance |\n| Tamil | 78.6\n | Dravidian | South\n |\n| Egyptian Arabic | 77.4\n | Afroasiatic | Semitic |\n| Standard German | 75.3\n | Indo-European | Germanic |\n| Urdu | 70.6\n | Indo-European | Indo-Aryan |\n| Javanese | 68.3\n | Austronesian | Malayo-Polynesian |\n| Western Punjabi | 66.7\n | Indo-European | Indo-Aryan |\n| Italian | 64.6\n | Indo-European | Romance |\n| Gujarati | 57.1\n | Indo-European | Indo-Aryan |\n| Iranian Persian | 57.2\n | Indo-European | Iranian |\n| Bhojpuri | 52.3\n | Indo-European | Indo-Aryan |\n| Hausa | 51.7\n | Afroasiatic | Chadic |\n\n\n### *CIA World Factbook* (2018 estimates)[edit]\n\n\nAccording to the *CIA World Factbook*, the most-spoken first languages in 2018 were:[8]\n\n\n\n\n\nTop first languages by population per *CIA*[8]\n| Rank\n | Language\n | Percentageof worldpopulation(2018)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Mandarin Chinese | 12.3%\n |\n| 2 | Spanish | 6.0%\n |\n| 3 | English | 5.1%\n |\n| 3 | Arabic | 5.1%\n |\n| 5 | Hindi | 3.5%\n |\n| 6 | Bengali | 3.3%\n |\n| 7 | Portuguese | 3.0%\n |\n| 8 | Russian | 2.1%\n |\n| 9 | Japanese | 1.7%\n |\n| 10 | Western Punjabi | 1.3%\n |\n| 11 | Javanese | 1.1%\n |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of languages by total number of speakers\n* List of sign languages by number of native signers\n* List of languages by the number of countries in which they are recognized as an official language\n* Number of languages by country\n* Languages used on the Internet\n* List of ISO 639-3 codes\n* Lists of languages\n* List of languages by number of speakers in Europe\n* Global language system\n* Linguistic diversity index\n* World language\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Paolillo, John C.; Das, Anupam (31 March 2006). \"Evaluating language statistics: the Ethnologue and beyond\" (PDF).
