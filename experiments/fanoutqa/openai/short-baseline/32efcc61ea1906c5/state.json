Kellogg's also introduced new products, including Crispix, Raisin Squares, and Nutri-Grain Biscuits, and reached out internationally with Just Right aimed at Australians and Genmai Flakes for Japan. During this time, the company maintained success over its top competitors: General Mills, which largely marketed children's cereals, and Post, which had difficulty in the adult cereal market.[15]\n\n\nIn 2001, Kellogg's acquired the Keebler Company for $3.87 billion.[16] Over the years, it has also gone on to acquire Morningstar Farms and Kashi divisions or subsidiaries. Kellogg's also owns the Bear Naked, Natural Touch, Cheez-It, Murray, Austin cookies and crackers, Famous Amos, Gardenburger (acquired 2007), and Plantation brands. Presently, Kellogg's is a member of the World Cocoa Foundation.[17]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n75. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Breakfast cereal mascots: Beloved and bizarre\". *cbsnews.com*.

From 1969 to 1977, Kellogg's acquired various small businesses, including Salada Tea, Fearn International, Mrs. Smith's Pies, Eggo, and Pure Packed Foods;[14] however, it was later criticized for not diversifying further like General Mills and Quaker Oats were. After underspending its competition in marketing and product development, Kellogg's US market share hit a low of 36.7% in 1983. A prominent Wall Street analyst called it \"a fine company that's past its prime\" and the cereal market was being regarded as \"mature\". Such comments stimulated Kellogg chairman William E. LaMothe to improve, which primarily involved approaching the demographic of 80 million baby boomers rather than marketing children-oriented cereals. In emphasizing cereal's convenience and nutritional value, Kellogg's helped persuade U.S. consumers aged 25 to 49 to eat 26% more cereal than people of that age ate five years prior.

Post, who took the cereal business seriously, was equipped to market and advertise his products nationwide; so successfully, in fact, that W.K. Kellogg broke away from his brother and in 1907 founded his own company, the Battle Creek Toasted Corn Flake Company (renamed the Kellogg Company in 1922). Kellogg's Corn Flakes eventually overtook Post Toasties in popularity and the latter brand is today only a minor player in the dry-cereal market.\n5. **^** See *International Directory of Company Histories*, Volume 2, pp 530-32, published by St. James Press, 1990, for details relating to the company during this period.\n6. **^** Biographical details of Post's life may be found in *American National Biography*, Volume 7, p. 732.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAs of January 2013, Eliza's Quest Food had succeeded in returning Postum to many grocery stores across the United States and Canada.\n\n\nIn 1897, Post introduced his first dry cereal, a crunchy blend of wheat and barley, which he called Grape Nuts. His first corn-flake product was introduced as \"Elijah's Manna\" in 1904. Owing to consumer resistance to the (inaccurate) biblical reference[3] that was so great that even Great Britain flatly refused to register the name as a trademark, it was renamed Post Toasties in 1907.[4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Malt-O-Meal - S'mores\n* Malt-O-Meal - Strawberry Cream Mini Spooners\n* Malt-O-Meal - Tootie Fruities\n* Malt-O-Meal - Tootie Fruities with Marshmallows\n* Post Dunkin' cereal - Caramel Macchiato\n* Post Premier Protein cereal - Chocolate Almond\n* Post Premier Protein cereal - Mixed Berry Almond\n* Raisin Bran\n* Shredded Wheat (made by Nestl\u00e9 and General Mills in the United Kingdom and Ireland)\n* Shredded Wheat \u2013 Original Spoon Size\n* Shredded Wheat \u2013 Original Big Biscuit\n* Shredded Wheat \u2013 Wheat'N Bran Spoon Size\n* Shreddies \u2013 currently only available in Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Germany (made by Nestl\u00e9 and General Mills in the United Kingdom and Ireland)\n* Waffle Crisp\n\n## Post Consumer Brands discontinued cereals[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* 40% Bran Flakes\n* Alpha-Bits\n* Beep Beep (with the Wile E.

Ferdinand Schumacher became president, Henry Crowell the general manager, and John Stuart the secretary-treasurer. In 1889, the American Cereal Company introduced the half-ounce trial size and, as a promotion, distributed one to every home in Portland, Oregon, via boys on bicycles. Later, this promotion was extended to other cities. A second promotion involved placing dinner plates within the then-regular (not round) boxes of oats.\n\n\n\n### Quaker Oats Company[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1879, John Stuart and his son Robert joined with George Douglas to form Imperial Mill and set up their operation in Chicago, Illinois. In 1881, Henry Parsons Crowell bought the Quaker Mill Company;[2] the following year, he launched the first national magazine advertising campaign for breakfast cereal, introducing a cereal box that made it possible to buy in quantities other than bulk. He also bought the bankrupt Quaker Oat Mill Company in Ravenna and held the key positions of general manager, president and chairman of the company from 1888 until late 1943, becoming known as the cereal tycoon. He donated more than 70% of his wealth to the Crowell Trust.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1911, the company acquired the Great Western Cereal Company. The iconic cylindrical package was introduced in 1915. Although Quaker Oats Company claims that the \"Quaker man\" is not meant to resemble or represent an actual person, the company identified the Quaker man as William Penn in advertising dating back to 1909. \n\n\nIn 1983, Quaker acquired Stokely-Van Camp, Inc., the maker of Van Camp's and Gatorade. In 2001, PepsiCo bought Quaker Oats for $14 billion, primarily to acquire the Gatorade brand.[1]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Precursor miller companies[edit]\n\n\n![](image)1905 magazine advertisement.\nIn the 1850s, Ferdinand Schumacher and Robert Stuart founded oat mills. Schumacher founded the German Mills American Oatmeal Company in Akron, Ohio, and Stuart founded the North Star Mills in Hearst, Ontario, Rupert's Land. In 1870, Schumacher ran his first known cereal advertisement in the Akron Beacon Journal newspaper. In 1877, the Quaker Mill Company of Ravenna, Ohio, was founded. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1908, Quaker Oats introduced the first in a series of cookie recipes on the box. In 1911, Quaker Oats purchased the Great Western Cereal Company. The iconic cylindrical package made its first appearance in 1915. Later that year, Quaker offered the first cereal box premium to buyers. By sending in one dollar and the cutout picture of the \"Quaker Man\" customers received a double boiler for the cooking of oatmeal. \n\n\nIn the 1920s, Quaker introduced \"Quaker Quick Oats\", an early convenience food, and also offered a crystal radio set built in the same cylindrical canister as Quick Oats, with the same label, for US$1 plus two trademarks cut from Quaker Oats packages.[6] In the 1930s, Quaker was one of the many companies using the Dionne Quintuplets for promotional purposes.[7] Quaker Oats in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, was photographed during the 1930s by Theodor Horydczak, who documented the building, operations, and factory workers at the plant.[8]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAmerican food conglomerate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Quaker Oats Company| ![](image) |\n| Company type | Subsidiary |\n| Industry | Food |\n| Founded | September\u00a04, 1877; 146 years ago\u00a0(1877-09-04) (as Quaker Mill Company)Ravenna, Ohio, U.S. |\n| Founder | Henry Parsons Crowell |\n| Headquarters | Chicago, Illinois\n, U.S.\n |\n| Area served\n | Worldwide |\n| Key people\n | Robbert Rietbroek (Senior Vice President & General Manager) |\n| Products | * Oats\n* Oatmeal (Porridge)\n* Cereal\n* Snacks\n |\n| Parent | PepsiCo |\n| Subsidiaries | Gatorade |\n| Website | quakeroats.com |\n\n\n**The Quaker Oats Company** (/\u02c8kwe\u026ak\u0259r o\u028ats/), known as **Quaker**, is an American food conglomerate based in Chicago, Illinois.
