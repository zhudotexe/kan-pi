Although according to the 1982 Constitution the role of President was \"largely ceremonial\", it recognized Li's status as a respected Party elder and a member of the CCP Politburo Standing Committee, and Li himself went on to forcefully use his still very substantial influence to support leftist policies. In 1984, Li met with U.S. President Ronald Reagan during the latter's visit to China, notably discussing the status of Taiwan with the President.[10] Li visited the United States in July 1985, the first time the head of state of the People's Republic of China made such a visit.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nVice Premiers of the People's Republic of China (list)\n |\n| --- |\n| Provisional Cabinet | 1.
