For doubles players, see List of ATP number 1 ranked doubles tennis players.\n\n\n\n\n\n![](image)Novak Djokovic, the current men's singles world No. 1.\nThe Pepperstone ATP rankings[1] are the Association of Tennis Professionals' (ATP) merit-based system for determining the rankings in men's tennis. The top-ranked player is the player who, over the previous 52 weeks, has garnered the most ranking points on the ATP Tour. Points are awarded based on how far a player advances in tournaments and the category of those tournaments. The ATP has used a computerized system for determining the rankings since August 23, 1973.[2] Starting in 1979, an updated rankings list is released at the beginning of each week. Since 1973, 28 players have been ranked No. 1 by the ATP,[3][4] of which 17 have been year-end No. 1.\n\n\nThe current world number one is Novak Djokovic.\n\n\n\n\n## Ranking method[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSince the introduction of the rankings, the method used to calculate a player's ranking points has changed several times. As of 2019, the rankings are calculated by totaling the points a player wins in his best eighteen tournaments, subject to certain restrictions. For top players the counting tournaments are the four Grand Slam tournaments, the eight mandatory ATP Masters tournaments, the non-mandatory ATP Masters 1000 event in Monte-Carlo, the player's best four eligible ATP Tour 500 tournaments and his best two results from ATP Tour 250 tournaments. Lower-ranked players who are not eligible for some or all of the top tournaments may include additional ATP 500 and ATP 250 events, and also ATP Challenger Tour and ITF Men's Circuit tournaments. Players who qualify for the year-end ATP Finals also include any points gained from the tournament in their total, increasing the number of tournaments counted to 19.[5]\n\n\n\n### ATP singles ranking[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| 36\n | Alcaraz |\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| 16\n | Medvedev |\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| 4\n | Nadal |\n\n* Stats are automatically updated on Mondays (UTC).\n\n\n |\n\n## No. 1 players by country[edit]\n\n\n* Current No. 1 player indicated in **bold**.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | ![](image)\u00a0Austria | 1 | 6 | Thomas Muster |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Chile | 1 | Marcelo R\u00edos |\n\n\nWeeks are updated automatically.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* World number 1 ranked male tennis players (includes rankings before 1973)\n* List of ATP number 1 ranked doubles tennis players\n* List of WTA number 1 ranked singles tennis players\n* List of WTA number 1 ranked doubles tennis players\n* ITF World Champions\n* Current ATP rankings\n* ATP players with highest rank of 2 to 10\n* Top ten ranked male tennis players\n* Top ten ranked male tennis players (1912\u20131972)\n* ATP rankings achievements \u2013 Men's singles\n* List of highest ranked tennis players per country\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n50. **^** \"2004 ATP Year End Rankings\". *atpworldtour.com*.
