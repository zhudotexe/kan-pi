As a result, the prevalence of English in the educational system has increased, with English classes becoming mandatory at all levels of the Japanese school system by 2020.[260] Japanese Sign Language is the primary sign language used in Japan and has gained some official recognition, but its usage has been historically hindered by discriminatory policies and a lack of educational support.[260]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Hokkaid\u014d | * Hokkaido\n |\n| T\u014dhoku | * Aomori\n* Iwate\n* Miyagi\n* Akita\n* Yamagata\n* Fukushima\n |\n| Kant\u014d | * Ibaraki\n* Tochigi\n* Gunma\n* Saitama\n* Chiba\n* Tokyo\n* Kanagawa\n |\n| Ch\u016bbu | * Niigata\n* Toyama\n* Ishikawa\n* Fukui\n* Yamanashi\n* Nagano\n* Gifu\n* Shizuoka\n* Aichi\n |\n| Kansai | * Mie\n* Shiga\n* Kyoto\n* Osaka\n* Hy\u014dgo\n* Nara\n* Wakayama\n |\n| Ch\u016bgoku | * Tottori\n* Shimane\n* Okayama\n* Hiroshima\n* Yamaguchi\n |\n| Shikoku | * Tokushima\n* Kagawa\n* Ehime\n* K\u014dchi\n |\n| Ky\u016bsh\u016b | * Fukuoka\n* Saga\n* Nagasaki\n* Kumamoto\n* \u014cita\n* Miyazaki\n* Kagoshima\n* Okinawa\n |\n\n |\n| * Category\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nEast Asia Summit (EAS)\n |\n| --- |\n| * 1st\n* 2nd\n* 3rd\n* 4th\n* 5th\n* 6th\n* 7th\n* 8th\n* 9th\n* 10th\n* 11th\n* 12th\n* 13th\n* 14th\n* 15th\n* 16th\n* 17th\n* 18th\n |\n| * Australia\n* Brunei\n* Cambodia\n* China\n* India\n* Indonesia\n* Japan\n* Laos\n* Malaysia\n* Myanmar\n* New Zealand\n* Philippines\n* Russia\n* Singapore\n* South Korea\n* Thailand\n* United States\n* Vietnam\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBesides Japanese, the Ryukyuan languages (Amami, Kunigami, Okinawan, Miyako, Yaeyama, Yonaguni), part of the Japonic language family, are spoken in the Ryukyu Islands chain.[262] Few children learn these languages,[263] but local governments have sought to increase awareness of the traditional languages.[264] The Ainu language, which is a language isolate, is moribund, with only a few native speakers remaining as of 2014[update].[265] Additionally, a number of other languages are taught and used by ethnic minorities, immigrant communities, and a growing number of foreign-language students, such as Korean (including a distinct Zainichi Korean dialect), Chinese and Portuguese.[260]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Education in Japan\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Africa | * Eswatini\n* Lesotho\n* Morocco\n* *list*\n |\n| Asia | * Bahrain\n* Bhutan\n* Brunei\n* Cambodia\n* Japan\n* Jordan\n* Kuwait\n* Malaysia\n* Oman\n* Qatar\n* Saudi Arabia\n* Thailand\n* United Arab Emirates\n* *list*\n |\n| Europe | * Andorra\n* Belgium\n* Denmark\n* Liechtenstein\n* Luxembourg\n* Monaco\n* Netherlands\n* Norway\n* Spain\n* Sweden\n* Vatican City (Holy See)\n |\n| Oceania | * Tonga\n |\n| Commonwealth realms | * Antigua and Barbuda\n* Australia\n* Bahamas\n* Belize\n* Canada\n* Grenada\n* Jamaica\n* New Zealand\n\t+ Cook Islands\n\t+ Niue\n* Papua New Guinea\n* Saint Kitts and Nevis\n* Saint Lucia\n* Saint Vincent and the Grenadines\n* Solomon Islands\n* Tuvalu\n* United Kingdom\n |\n\n |\n| Former | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Typography\n* Yog\u0101c\u0101ra\n* Chinese zodiac\n |\n| Environment | * East Asia Climate Partnership\n* Monsoon\n* Rainy season\n* Flora\n |\n| Economy and Politics | * China\u2013Japan\u2013South Korea trilateral summit\n* Comprehensive Economic Partnership for East Asia\n* Capitalism\n* East Asia Summit\n* East Asian Bureau of Economic Research\n* East Asian Community\n* Four Asian Tigers\n* Human rights in East Asia\n* Ports\n* Stock exchanges\n |\n| History | * Archaeology\n* Archaeological cultures\n* Bronze Age\n* Iron Age\n* Former countries\n |\n| Sports | * China\u2013Japan\u2013Korea Friendship Athletic Meeting\n* East Asian Football Federation\n* East Asian Games\n* East Asian Judo Championships\n* East Asian martial arts\n* East Asian Youth Games\n* EAFF E-1 Football Championship\n |\n| Education | * Association of East Asian Research Universities\n* CrossAsia\n* East Asian Economic Review\n* East Asia Image Collection\n* East Asia Law Review\n* East Asian studies\n* Journal of East Asian Studies\n* Ludwigshafen East Asia Institute\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n124. **^** \"Regions of Japan\" (PDF).
