Large parts of the fortification system date from the 7th through the 4th century BC. In the 3rd century BC Shihuangdi (Qin Shi Huang), the first emperor of a united China (under the Qin dynasty), connected a number of existing defensive walls into a single system. Traditionally, the eastern terminus of the wall was considered to be Shanhai Pass (Shanhaiguan) on the coast of the Bohai (Gulf of Zhili), and the wall's length\u00a0\u2013 without its branches and other secondary sections\u00a0\u2013 was thought to extend for some 6,690\u00a0km (4,160\u00a0mi).\n6. **^** Shelach-Lavi, Gideon; Wachtel, Ido; Golan, Dan; Batzorig, Otgonjargal; Amartuvshin, Chunag; Ellenblum, Ronnie; Honeychurch, William (June 2020). \"Medieval long-wall construction on the Mongolian Steppe during the eleventh to thirteenth centuries AD\". *Antiquity*. **94** (375): 724\u2013741. doi:10.15184/aqy.2020.51.

In a popular poll in 2007, it was also named one of the New 7 Wonders of the World. The Petra Archaeological Park (PAP) became an autonomous legal entity over the management of this site in August 2007.[67]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Urn Tomb\nThe Bidouls belong to one of the Bedouin tribes whose cultural heritage and traditional skills were proclaimed by UNESCO on the Intangible Cultural Heritage List in 2005 and inscribed[68] in 2008.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nA central issue is the management of water impacting the built heritage and the rock hewn facades.[84] The large number of discoveries and the exposure of structures and findings demand conservation measures respecting the interlinkage between the natural landscape and cultural heritage, as especially this connection is a central challenge at the UNECSO World Heritage Site.[85]\n\n\nIn recent years different conservation campaigns and projects were established at the cultural heritage site of Petra.[86] The main works first focussed on the entrance situation of the Siq to protect tourists and to facilitate access. Also, different projects for conservation and conservation research were conducted. Following is a list of projects, to be continued.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)the \"Street of Facades\"\nBecause the structures weakened with age, many of the tombs became vulnerable to thieves, and many treasures were stolen. In 1929, a four-person team consisting of British archaeologists Agnes Conway and George Horsfield, Palestinian physician and folklore expert Tawfiq Canaan and Ditlef Nielsen, a Danish scholar, excavated and surveyed Petra.[39]\n\n\nThe archaeologist Philip Hammond from the University of Utah visited Petra for nearly 40 years. He explained that the local folklore says it was created by the wand of Moses, when he struck the rock to bring forth water for the Israelites. Hammond believed the carved channels deep within the walls and ground were made from ceramic pipes that once fed water for the city, from rock-cut systems on the canyon rim.[40]\n\n\nNumerous scrolls in Greek and dating to the Byzantine period were discovered in an excavated church near the Temple of the Winged Lions in Petra in December 1993.[41]\n\n\n\n### 21st century[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

While visitors can walk around them, they can no longer climb them or go inside their chambers. Climbing access to El Castillo was closed after a San Diego, California, woman fell to her death in 2006.[50]\n\n\n\n## Photograph gallery[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n62. **^** El Chich\u00e1n Chob y la Casa del Venado, Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1, Yucat\u00e1n.

It is regarded by many as the best example of Mughal architecture and a symbol of India's rich history. The Taj Mahal attracts 7-8\u00a0million visitors a year,[8] and in 2007 it was declared a winner of the New 7 Wonders of the World (2000\u20132007) initiative.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nAbdul Hamid Lahori, in his book from 1636 *Padshahnama*, refers to the Taj Mahal as *rauza-i munawwara* (Perso-Arabic: \u0631\u0648\u0636\u0647 \u0645\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0631\u0647, *rawdah-i munawwarah*), meaning the illumined or illustrious tomb.[9]\nThe current name for the Taj Mahal is of Urdu origin, and believed to be derived from Arabic and Persian, with the words *t\u0101j mahall* meaning \"crown\" (*t\u0101j*) \"palace\" (*mahall*).[10][11][4] The name \"Taj\" came from the corruption of the second syllable of \"Mumtaz\".[12][13]\n\n\n\n## Inspiration[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nEastern view in the morning\n* ![Taj Mahal in cloudy weather and its minaret under restoration](image)\n\nTaj Mahal in cloudy weather and its minaret under restoration\n* ![Western view at sunset](image)\n\nWestern view at sunset\n* ![Taj Mahal through the fog](image)\n\nTaj Mahal through the fog\n* ![A panoramic view looking 360 degrees around the Taj Mahal in 2005](image)\n\nA panoramic view looking 360 degrees around the Taj Mahal in 2005\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)India portal\n* ![](image)Islam portal\n* ![icon](image)Architecture portal\n\n\n* Architecture of India\n* Bibi Ka Maqbara, a similar building in the Deccan, Aurangabad\n* Fatehpur Sikri, a nearby city and World Heritage Site\n* Islamic architecture\n* Indo-Islamic architecture\n* *Inside*, a 1968 new-age music album recorded in the building\n* List of tallest domes\n* List of tallest structures built before the 20th century\n* New 7 Wonders of the World\n* Taj Mahal replicas and derivatives\n* Wonders of the World\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
