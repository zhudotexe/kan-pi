They center around the player, who is in control of most of the action. Most of the earliest video games were considered action games; today, it is still a vast genre covering all games that involve physical challenges.\n\n\nAction games are classified by many subgenres. Platform games and fighting games are among the best-known subgenres, while shooter games became and continue to be one of the dominant genres in video gaming since the 1990s.[3][4] Action games usually involve elements of twitch gameplay.[3]\n\n\n\n### Platform games[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Platform game\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSince the 1990s, shooters, most notably first-person shooters, have become widely successful in video gaming, accounting for a large percentage of video game sales.[12] *Wolfenstein 3D*, created by Id Software and released in 1992, was credited for pioneering gameplay and graphics elements incorporated by many other shooters.[13] Also developed by Id and published one year after Wolfenstein 3D's release, *Doom* is broadly considered to be one of the most influential games in video gaming history.[13] Other successful shooter series include *Half-Life*, a widely acclaimed and commercially successful series noted for its influence on contemporary shooters; and the *Call of Duty* franchise, with more than 250 million sales across all its titles.[14]\n\n\n\n### Fighting games[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Fighting game\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nVideo game genres\n |\n| --- |\n| * List of video game genres\n |\n| Action | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Platformer | * Endless runner\n* Platform fighter\n |\n| Shooter | * Arena\n* First-person\n* Hero\n* Light gun\n* Shoot 'em up\n\t+ Bullet hell\n\t+ Rail\n\t+ Twin-stick\n* Tactical\n* Third-person\n |\n| Survival | * Battle royale\n* Survival horror\n |\n| Other | * Beat 'em up\n\t+ Hack and slash\n* Fighting\n\t+ Platform fighter\n* Maze\n\t+ *Pac-Man* clone\n* Snake\n* Stealth\n |\n\n | ![](image)\n |\n| Action-adventure | * *Grand Theft Auto* clone\n* Metroidvania\n |\n| Adventure | * Escape room\n* Graphic adventure\n* Interactive fiction\n* Interactive film\n* Visual novel\n* Walking sim\n |\n| Digital tabletop | * Deck-building\n\t+ Roguelike deck-building\n* Digital collectible card\n |\n| Puzzle | * Hidden object\n* *Sokoban*\n* Tile-matching\n |\n| Role-playing | * Action role-playing\n\t+ Looter shooter\n\t+ Soulslike\n* Dungeon crawl\n* Monster-taming\n* Roguelike\n\t+ Roguelike deck-building\n* Tactical role-playing\n |\n| Simulation | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA video game genre is a specific category of games related by similar gameplay characteristics. Video game genres are not usually defined by the setting or story of the game or its medium of play, but by the way the player interacts with the game.[1] For example; a first-person shooter is still a first-person shooter regardless of whether it takes place in a science fiction, western, fantasy, or military setting; so long as it features a camera mimicking the perspective of the protagonist (first-person) and gameplay centered around the use of ranged weaponry.\n\n\nGenres may encompass a wide variety of games, leading to even more specific classifications called *subgenres*. For example, an action game can be classified into many subgenres such as platform games and fighting games. Some games, most notably browser and mobile games, are commonly classified into multiple genres.[1][2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) |\n| Video games |\n| Platforms\n* Arcade video game\n* Console game\n\t+ Game console\n\t+ Home console\n\t+ Handheld console\n* Electronic game\n\t+ Audio game\n\t+ Electronic handheld\n* Online game\n\t+ Browser game\n\t+ Social-network game\n* Mobile game\n* PC game\n\t+ Linux\n\t+ Mac\n* Virtual reality game\n |\n| Genres\n* Action\n\t+ Shooter\n* Action-adventure\n* Adventure\n* Casual\n* Puzzle\n* Role-playing\n* Simulation\n\t+ Sports\n\t+ Racing\n* Strategy\n |\n| Lists\n* Arcade games\n\t+ highest-grossing\n* Best-selling games\n\t+ franchises\n* Longest-running franchises\n* Most-played mobile games\n* Games considered the best\n\t+ Game of the Year\n\t+ soundtracks\n* Negative reception\n* Cancelled games\n |\n| Development\n* Producer\n* Developer\n\t+ Designer\n\t+ Artist\n\t+ Programmer\n* Design\n\t+ Level design\n* Programming\n\t+ Engine\n\t+ AI\n* Graphics\n* Music\n* Testing\n |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n81. **^** Terdiman, Daniel (March 23, 2006). \"What's wrong with serious games?\".
