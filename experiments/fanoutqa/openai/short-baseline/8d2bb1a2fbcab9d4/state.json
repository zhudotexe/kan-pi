The list was first published in March 1987.[1] The total net worth of each individual on the list is estimated and is cited in United States dollars, based on their documented assets and accounting for debt and other factors. Royalty and dictators whose wealth comes from their positions are excluded from these lists.[3] This ranking is an index of the wealthiest documented individuals, excluding any ranking of those with wealth that is not able to be completely ascertained.[4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nBillionaires\n |\n| --- |\n| By citizenship | * Argentina\n* Austria\n* Belgium\n* Brazil\n* Canada\n* Chile\n* China (PRC)\n* Colombia\n* Cyprus\n* Czech Republic\n* Denmark\n* Egypt\n* France\n* Germany\n* Greece\n* Hong Kong\n* India\n* Indonesia\n* Ireland\n* Israel\n* Italy\n* Japan\n* Kenya\n* Lebanon\n* Malaysia\n* Mexico\n* Netherlands\n* New Zealand\n* Norway\n* Pakistan\n* Peru\n* Poland\n* Portugal\n* Romania\n* Russia\n* Saudi Arabia\n* Singapore\n* South Africa\n* South Korea\n* Spain\n* Sweden\n* Switzerland\n* Taiwan\n* Thailand\n* Turkey\n* UAE\n* Ukraine\n* United Kingdom\n* United States\n* Vietnam\n |\n| By region | * World\n* Africa\n* ASEAN\n* Europe\n* Latin America\n |\n| *Forbes* lists | * The World's Billionaires\n\t+ 2010\n\t+ 2011\n\t+ 2012\n\t+ 2013\n\t+ 2014\n\t+ 2015\n\t+ 2016\n\t+ 2017\n\t+ 2018\n\t+ 2019\n\t+ 2020\n\t+ 2021\n\t+ 2022\n\t+ 2023\n* *Forbes* 400\n |\n| Lists | * Black\n* Bloomberg Billionaires Index\n* *Financial Review* Rich List (Australia)\n* *Sunday Times* Rich List (UK)\n* *Forbes* Fictional 15\n* LGBT\n* Women\n* Spacetravellers\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBill Gates was named the richest man in the world by *Forbes*' annual list of the world's billionaires. This was the 16th time that the founder of Microsoft claimed the top spot. Carlos Slim came in second for the second consecutive time. Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway placed third, while Amancio Ortega of Spain, slipped down a position from the previous year to number four. Larry Ellison, the founder of Oracle, rounded off the top five. Christy Walton was the highest-ranking female at number eight. America's Evan Spiegel, co-founder of photo messaging app Snapchat, became the youngest billionaire this year at age 24. At age 99, David Rockefeller maintained his position as the oldest billionaire included in the list.[27] Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, rose to number 16 with $33.4 billion. Iceland had a billionaire, Thor Bjorgolfsson, in the list after a gap of five years. Guatemala had a billionaire, Mario Lopez Estrada, for the first time in its history.[28]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSince stock prices fluctuate rapidly, an individual's true wealth and ranking at the time of publication may vary from their situation when the list was compiled.[7]\n\n\nWhen a living individual has dispersed his or her wealth to immediate family members it is included under a single listing (as a single \"family fortune\") provided that individual (the grantor) is still living. However, if a deceased billionaire's fortune has been dispersed, it will not appear as a single listing, and each recipient will only appear if his or her own total net worth is over a $Billion (his or her net worth will not be combined with family members')[7] Royal families and dictators that have their wealth contingent on a position are always excluded from these lists.[9]\n\n\n\n## Annual rankings[edit]\n\n\n\nThe rankings are published annually in March, so the net worths listed are snapshots taken at that time. These lists only show the top 10 wealthiest billionaires for each year.\n\n\n\n### Legend[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* By alumni\n |\n| Other | * Billionaire space race\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nExtreme wealth\n |\n| --- |\n| Concepts | \n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * Capital accumulation\n\t+ Overaccumulation\n* Economic inequality\n\t+ Wealth distribution\n\t+ Income distribution\n\t+ Consumption distribution\n\t+ History of economic inequality\n* International inequality\n* Elite\n* Oligarchy\n* Overclass\n* Plutocracy\n* Plutonomy\n\t+ - Primitive accumulation of capital\n* Upper class\n\t+ *Nouveau riche* (new money)\n\t+ *Vieux riche* (old money)\n* Luxury goods\n\t+ Veblen goods\n\t\t- Conspicuous consumption\n\t\t- Conspicuous leisure\n |\n| People | * Billionaire\n* Captain of industry\n* High-net-worth individual\n\t+ UHNWI\n* Magnate\n\t+ Business\n* Millionaire\n* Oligarch\n\t+ Business\n\t+ Russian\n\t+ Ukrainian\n* Robber baron\n |\n| Wealth | * Concentration\n* Distribution\n* Dynastic\n* Effect\n* Geography\n* Inherited\n* Management\n* National\n* Paper\n* Religion\n* Tax\n |\n\n |\n| Lists | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n*Forbes* magazine\n |\n| --- |\n| Companies | * *Forbes* Global 2000\n* *Forbes* 500\n | ![](image)\n |\n| People | * The World's Billionaires\n* *Forbes* 400\n* 30 Under 30\n* Australia's 50 Richest People\n* World's Most Powerful People\n* World's 100 Most Powerful Women\n |\n| Entertainment | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| General | * *Forbes* Top 40\n* Celebrity 100\n* *Forbes* Fictional 15\n* China Celebrity 100\n* Korea Power Celebrity 40\n* Highest-paid dead celebrities\n |\n| Fashion | * Highest-paid models\n |\n| Film | * Highest-paid actors\n |\n| Music | * Highest-paid musicians\n |\n| Sport | * Highest-paid athletes\n* Most valuable sports teams\n\t+ Football clubs\n\t\t- MLS clubs\n\t+ NFL teams\n\t+ MLB teams\n\t+ NBA teams\n\t+ NHL teams\n |\n\n |\n| Education | * America's Top Colleges\n |\n| Technology | * Midas List (Tech's Top Deal Makers)\n |\n| Related topics | * Lists of people by net worth\n* Wealthiest musical artists\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn the 30th anniversary of the *Forbes* list of the world's billionaires, for the fourth year in a row, Bill Gates was named the richest man in the world.[5] In 2017, there was a record of 2,043 people on the list, which is the first time over 2,000 people were listed. This included 195 newcomers of whom 76 were from China and 25 from the U.S.; there were 56 people under 40 and it had a record of 227 women.[17] The number of billionaires increased 13% to 2,043 from 1,810 in 2016; this was the biggest change in over 30 years of tracking billionaires globally.[5] Added together, the total net worth for 2017's billionaires was US$7.67\u00a0trillion, up from US$7.1\u00a0trillion in 2015.[5][18] This was the first time after 12 years that Carlos Slim was not within the top five. The U.S. had the most billionaires in the world, with a record of 565. China had 319 (not including Hong Kong, Taiwan or Macau), Germany had 114, and India had the fourth most with 101; India reached over 100 billionaires for its first time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the 32nd annual *Forbes* list of the world's billionaires, the aggregate wealth of the top 20 richest people on Earth amounted to about 13 percent of all billionaires' fortunes combined.[15] A record of 2,208 billionaires were in the ranking and the total wealth was $9.1 trillion, up 18% since 2017. For the first time, Jeff Bezos was listed as the top billionaire due to Amazon's rising stock price that resulted in one person's biggest one-year gain in wealth ($35 billion) since *Forbes* started tracking in 1987.[15] The U.S. had the most billionaires in the world, with 585, while China was catching up with 476 when including Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan; it had 372 when excluding those three places.[15] Forbes excluded Al-Walid bin Talal and all other Saudi billionaires due to the absence of accurate wealth estimations as a result of the 2017\u201319 Saudi Arabian purge.[16]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the 37th annual *Forbes* list of the world's billionaires, the list included 2,640 billionaires with a total net wealth of $12.2 trillion, down 28 members and $500 billion from 2022. Over half of the list is less wealthy compared to the previous year, including Elon Musk, who fell from No. 1 to No. 2.[2] The list also marks for the first time a French citizen was in the top position as well as a non-American for the first time since 2013 when the Mexican Carlos Slim Helu was the world's richest person. The list, like in 2022, counted 15 under 30 billionaires with the richest of them being Red Bull heir Mark Mateschitz with a net worth of $34.7 billion. The youngest of the lot were Clemente Del Vecchio, heir to the Luxottica fortune shared with his six siblings and stepmother, and Kim Jung-yang, whose fortune lies in Japanese-South Korean gaming giant Nexon, both under-20s.[10]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
