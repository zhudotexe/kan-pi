It is the core of the metropolitan area known as \"Great Salvador\", which had an estimated 3,957,123 inhabitants in 2020 according to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE). This makes it the second most populous metropolitan area in the Northeast, the seventh in Brazil, and one of the largest in the world. Also due to these urban-population dimensions, it is classified by the IBGE study on the Brazilian urban network as a regional metropolis. In its reports for the years 2014 and 2020, the Research Network of Globalization and World Cities (GaWC) classified Salvador as a global city in the \"Sufficiency\" category (the smallest). \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSee also: Brazilians, Demographics of Brazil, and Immigration to Brazil\n\n![](image)Rio Vermelho and Horto Florestal neighborhoods\n![](image)View of Farol da Barra Lighthouse\n![](image)Luís Viana Avenue (also known as Paralela Avenue).

Because of its location on Brazil's northeastern coast, the city served as an important link in the Portuguese empire throughout the colonial era, maintaining close commercial ties with Portugal and Portuguese colonies in Africa and Asia.[60]\n\n\nSalvador remained the preeminent city in Brazil until 1763 when it was replaced as the national capital by Rio de Janeiro. In the last ten years many high-rise office and apartment buildings were constructed, sharing the same blocks with colonial-era housing or commercial buildings.[61]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWith its beaches, humid tropical climate, numerous up-to-date shopping malls (The Shopping Iguatemi was the first shopping mall in Northeastern Brazil) and pleasant high-class residential areas, the city has much to offer its residents.\n\n\n\n![](image)Aerial view of Iguatemi mall.\nEconomically Salvador is one of Brazil's more important cities. Since its founding the city has been one of Brazil's most prominent ports and international trading centers. Boasting a large oil refinery, a petrochemical plant and other important industries, the city has made great strides in reducing its historical dependence on agriculture for its prosperity.[62]\n\n\nSalvador is the second most popular tourism destination in Brazil, after Rio de Janeiro.[63] Tourism and cultural activity are important generators of employment and income, boosting the arts and the preservation of artistic and cultural heritage.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n54. **^** Magalhães da Silva T, Sandhya Rani MR, Nunes de Oliveira Costa G, Figueiredo MA, Melo PS, Nascimento JF, Molyneaux ND, Barreto ML, Reis MG, Teixeira MG, Blanton RE (2015). \"The correlation between ancestry and color in two cities of Northeast Brazil with contrasting ethnic compositions\". *European Journal of Human Genetics*. **23** (7): 984–989. doi:10.1038/ejhg.2014.215.
