The designed hydraulic head of the generators is 80.6 metres (264\u00a0ft). The flow rate varies between 600\u2013950 cubic metres per second (21,000\u201334,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s) depending on the head available; the greater the head, the less water needed to reach full power. Three Gorges uses Francis turbines with a diameter of 9.7/10.4\u00a0m (VGS design/Alstom's design) and a rotation speed of 75\u00a0revolutions per minute. This means that in order to generate power at 50\u00a0Hz, the generator rotors have 80 poles. Rated power is 778 MVA, with a maximum of 840\u00a0MVA and a power factor of 0.9. The generator produces electrical power at 20\u00a0kV. The electricity generated is then stepped up to 500\u00a0kV for transmission at 50\u00a0Hz. The generator's stator, the biggest of its kind, is 3.1/3\u00a0m in height; the outer diameter of the stator is 21.4/20.9\u00a0m, the inner diameter is 18.5/18.8\u00a0m, and the bearing load is 5,050/5,500 tonnes. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe dam's body was completed in 2006; the power plant was completed and fully operational by 2012,[10][11] when the last of the main water turbines in the underground plant began production. Each of the main water turbines has a capacity of 700\u00a0MW.[12][13] Combining the capacity of the dam's 32 main turbines with the two smaller generators (50\u00a0MW each) that provide power to the plant itself, the total electric generating capacity of the Three Gorges Dam is 22,500\u00a0MW.[12][14][15] The last major component of the project, the ship lift, was completed in 2015.[16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n61. **^** 2012\u5e74\u4e09\u5ce1\u5de5\u7a0b\u5efa\u8bbe\u4e0e\u8fd0\u884c\u7ba1\u7406\u6210\u6548\u5341\u5206\u663e\u8457 (in Chinese).

Here are some key details about its construction costs and financial aspects:\n\n1. **Estimated Cost**: The Chinese government initially estimated the cost of the Three Gorges Dam project to be 180 billion yuan (approximately US$22.5 billion).\n\n2. **Actual Spending**: By the end of 2008, the total spending had reached 148.365 billion yuan. This included:\n   - 64.613 billion yuan on construction.\n   - 68.557 billion yuan on relocating affected residents.\n   - 15.195 billion yuan on financing.\n\n3. **Cost Recovery**: It was estimated in 2009 that the cost of construction would be fully recouped when the dam had generated 1,000 terawatt-hours (3,600 PJ) of electricity, yielding 250 billion yuan. The entire cost of the Three Gorges Dam was recovered by December 20, 2013.\n\n4. **Power Distribution and Transmission Costs**: The power distribution and transmission infrastructure cost about 34.387 billion yuan, and construction was completed in December 2007, one year ahead of schedule.\n\nThe dam's construction involved significant financial investment, but it has been able to recover its costs through the generation and sale of electricity.",
