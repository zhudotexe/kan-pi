The generator produces electrical power at 20 kV. The electricity generated is then stepped up to 500 kV for transmission at 50 Hz. The generator's stator, the biggest of its kind, is 3.1/3 m in height; the outer diameter of the stator is 21.4/20.9 m, the inner diameter is 18.5/18.8 m, and the bearing load is 5,050/5,500 tonnes. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe dam's body was completed in 2006; the power plant was completed and fully operational by 2012,[10][11] when the last of the main water turbines in the underground plant began production. Each of the main water turbines has a capacity of 700 MW.[12][13] Combining the capacity of the dam's 32 main turbines with the two smaller generators (50 MW each) that provide power to the plant itself, the total electric generating capacity of the Three Gorges Dam is 22,500 MW.[12][14][15] The last major component of the project, the ship lift, was completed in 2015.[16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n61. **^** 2012年三峡工程建设与运行管理成效十分显著 (in Chinese).
