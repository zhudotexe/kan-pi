The university was granted a charter (*Authentica habita*) by Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa in 1158, but in the 19th century, a committee of historians led by Giosu\u00e8 Carducci traced the founding of the university back to 1088, which would make it the oldest continuously operating university in the world.[11][12][13] However, the development of the institution at Bologna into a university was a gradual process. Paul Grendler writes that \"it is not likely that enough instruction and organization existed to merit the term *university* before the 1150s, and it might not have happened before the 1180s.\"[14]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n88. **^** \"Ulisse Aldrovandi | Italian naturalist\". *Encyclopedia Britannica*.

These were founded as charitable institutions to enable poor scholars to attend the university. By the eighteenth century they had become closed corporations controlled by the families of their founders, and dominated the university between them. Most were destroyed by Napoleon's troops. In the 19th century, the Spanish government dissolved the university's faculties of canon law and theology. They were later reestablished in the 1940s as part of the Pontifical University of Salamanca.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Related affairs[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nCompostela Group of Universities\n |\n| --- |\n| Members | * Adam Mickiewicz University in Pozna\u0144\n* Centro de Ense\u00f1anza T\u00e9cnica y Superior\n* Columbus University\n* ESAN University\n* Grigol Robakidze University\n* Ilia State University\n* Jaume I University\n* Karlstad University\n* Kazimieras Simonavi\u010dius University\n* King Juan Carlos University\n* Kore University of Enna\n* Masaryk University\n* Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education\n* Federico Villarreal National University\n* National University of San Marcos\n* Pan-European University\n* Peruvian University of Applied Sciences\n* Philipps University of Marburg\n* Pontifical Catholic University of Peru\n* S\u00e3o Paulo State University\n* Santo Domingo Institute of Technology\n* Technical University of Madrid\n* Universidad An\u00e1huac Xalapa (Anahuac University Network)\n* Universidad La Salle M\u00e9xico\n* Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Cartagena\n* Universit\u00e0 telematica internazionale Uninettuno\n* University Business Academy in Novi Sad\n* University of A Coru\u00f1a\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe faculty renovated the theology department, laid the foundation for modern-day law, international law, modern economic science and actively participated in the Council of Trent. The school's mathematicians studied the calendar reform, commissioned by Pope Gregory XIII and proposed the solution that was later implemented. By 1580, 6,500 new students had arrived at Salamanca each year, amongst the graduates were state officials of the Spanish monarchy administration. It was also during this period when the first female university students were probably admitted, Beatriz Galindo and Luisa de Medrano, the latter probably being the first woman ever to give classes at a university.[13]\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n### Sorcery[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPrior to the foundation of the university, Salamanca was home to a cathedral school, known to have been in existence by 1130. The university was founded as a *studium generale* by the Leonese king Alfonso IX in 1218 as the *scholas Salamanticae*, with the actual creation of the university (or the transformation of the existing school into the university) occurring between August 1218 and the following winter.[1] A further royal charter from King Alfonso X, dated 8 May 1254, established rules for the organisation and financial endowment of the university, and referred to it for the first time by that name.[10] A papal bull of Alexander IV in 1255 confirmed the Royal Charter of Alfonso X and granted universal recognition to the university's degrees.[11]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Emerging around 1150 as a corporation associated with the cathedral school of Notre Dame de Paris, it was considered the second-oldest university in Europe.[1]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFour colleges appeared in the 12th century; they became more numerous in the 13th, including Coll\u00e8ge d'Harcourt (1280) and the Coll\u00e8ge de Sorbonne (1257). Thus the University of Paris assumed its basic form. It was composed of seven groups, the four nations of the faculty of arts, and the three superior faculties of theology, law, and medicine. Men who had studied at Paris became an increasing presence in the high ranks of the Church hierarchy; eventually, students at the University of Paris saw it as a right that they would be eligible to benefices. Church officials such as St. Louis and Clement IV lavishly praised the university.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe faculty and nation system of the University of Paris (along with that of the University of Bologna) became the model for all later medieval universities. Under the governance of the Church, students wore robes and shaved the tops of their heads in tonsure, to signify they were under the protection of the church. Students followed the rules and laws of the Church and were not subject to the king's laws or courts. This presented problems for the city of Paris, as students ran wild, and its official had to appeal to Church courts for justice. Students were often very young, entering the school at 13 or 14 years of age and staying for six to 12 years.\n\n\n\n### 12th century: Organisation[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe three schools: Notre-Dame, Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve, and Saint-Victor, may be regarded as the triple cradle of the *Universitas scholarium*, which included masters and students; hence the name *University*. Henry Denifle and some others hold that this honour is exclusive to the school of Notre-Dame (Chartularium Universitatis Parisiensis), but the reasons do not seem convincing. He excludes Saint-Victor because, at the request of the abbot and the religious of Saint-Victor, Gregory IX in 1237 authorized them to resume the interrupted teaching of theology. But the university was largely founded about 1208, as is shown by a Bull of Innocent III. Consequently, the schools of Saint-Victor might well have contributed to its formation. Secondly, Denifle excludes the schools of Ste-Genevi\u00e8ve because there had been no interruption in the teaching of the liberal arts. This is debatable and through the period, theology was taught. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Verger, Jacques: *Histoire des Universit\u00e9s en France* (History of French Universities), Toulouse: Editions Privat, 1986\n* Traver, Andrew G.
