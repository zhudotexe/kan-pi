It received positive reviews initially, but reception became more mixed as the seasons went on.[2][3][4] The show was nominated for 91 awards and received 21. In 2010, Alyson Hannigan won the People's Choice Award for Favorite TV Comedy Actress. In 2012, seven years after its premiere, the series won the People's Choice Award for Favorite Network TV Comedy, and Neil Patrick Harris won the award for Favorite TV Comedy Actor twice.\n\n\n\n\n## Premise[edit]\n\n\nThe series follows the adventures of Ted Mosby (played by Josh Radnor) and his love life as a single man. His stories are narrated by Bob Saget as Ted Mosby 25 years later as he tells them to his children.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n*How I Met Your Mother* was inspired by Carter Bays and Craig Thomas' idea to \"write about our friends and the stupid stuff we did in New York\", where they previously worked as writers for *Late Show with David Letterman*, among others.[1] The two drew from their friendship in creating the characters. Ted is based loosely on Bays, and Marshall and Lily are based loosely on Thomas and his wife.[5][6] Thomas' wife Rebecca was initially reluctant to have a character based on her but agreed if they could get Alyson Hannigan to play her. Hannigan was looking to do more comedy work and was available.[5] Josh Radnor and Jason Segel, who were cast as Ted and Marshall, respectively, were not well known, although Segel had been a cast member on the short-lived *Freaks and Geeks* and a recurring guest star on Judd Apatow's follow-up show, *Undeclared*. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe story goes into a flashback and starts in 2005 with Ted Mosby living in New York City and working as an architect. The narrative deals primarily with his best friends. These include the long-lasting couple Marshall Eriksen (Jason Segel), a law student and Lily Aldrin (Alyson Hannigan), a kindergarten teacher, who have been dating for almost nine years when Marshall proposes, as well as womanizing playboy Barney Stinson (Neil Patrick Harris), and Canadian news reporter Robin Scherbatsky (Cobie Smulders). All of the characters' lives are entwined. The series explores many storylines, including a \"will they or won't they\" relationship between Robin and each of the two single male friends, Marshall and Lily's relationship, and the ups and downs of the characters' careers.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAccording to an *Entertainment Weekly* article, the writers adopted facets of each main actor's personality and incorporated them into their characters. This includes Neil Patrick Harris' skills with magic, Jason Segel's passion for songwriting, Alyson Hannigan's absent-mindedness while pregnant, and Josh Radnor's intellectualism.[14]\n\n\nMacLaren's, an Irish bar in the middle of New York City, in which a lot of the show is set, is loosely based on four favorite bars of Bays, Thomas, and others' from the *Late Show* staff. Others include: McGee's, a Midtown tavern near the Ed Sullivan Theater where the *Late Show* is taped; McHale's, a legendary Hell's Kitchen bar which closed in 2006; Chumley's, a since-closed historic Greenwich Village pub; and Fez, another closed bar on the Upper West Side.[15] McGee's had a mural that Bays and Thomas both liked and wanted to incorporate into the show.[16] The name for the bar is from Carter Bays' assistant, Carl MacLaren; the bartender in the show is also named Carl.[17]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn September 2008, Lifetime Television announced it had purchased the cable rerun rights to *How I Met Your Mother* at a rate of about $725,000 per episode.[28] The four-year syndication contract stipulated that the studio deliver at least 110 half-hour episodes by 2010 and allowed for up to eight seasons of the show. At the end of the fourth season only 88 episodes had been produced, and a further 22 episodes were required, ensuring that there would be a fifth season.[29] There also was a complication with the writing of the show because of actress Alyson Hannigan's absence due to her pregnancy; in response, the writers had to create episodes that did not include one of the five main characters.[30] On May 19, 2009, the fifth-season renewal was announced.[31] May 20, 2009, CBS announced that *How I Met Your Mother* would again be aired at 8 pm, leading into the new comedy *Accidentally on Purpose*. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"TV Summer School: How to Create and Run a Successful Sitcom\". *E!

The series, which aired from September 19, 2005 to March 31, 2014, follows the main character, Ted Mosby, and his group of friends in New York City's Manhattan. As a framing device, Ted, in 2030, recounts to his son, Luke, and daughter, Penny, the events from September 2005 to May 2013 that led him to meet their mother. *How I Met Your Mother* was a joint production by Bays & Thomas Productions and 20th Century Fox Television, and syndicated by 20th Television (now Disney-ABC Domestic Television).\n\n\nThe series was loosely inspired by Thomas and Bays' friendship when they both lived in New York.[1] The vast majority of the episodes (196 out of 208) were directed by Pamela Fryman. The other directors were Rob Greenberg (7 episodes), Michael Shea (4 episodes), and Neil Patrick Harris (1 episode).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| *How I Met Your Mother* |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)The cast pictured in the opening sequence\n |\n| Genre | * Sitcom\n* Romantic comedy\n* Comedy drama\n |\n| Created by | * Carter Bays\n* Craig Thomas\n |\n| Starring | * Josh Radnor\n* Jason Segel\n* Cobie Smulders\n* Neil Patrick Harris\n* Alyson Hannigan\n* Cristin Milioti\n |\n| Narrated by | Bob Saget |\n| Opening theme | \"Hey, Beautiful\" by The Solids |\n| Composer | John Swihart |\n| Country of origin | United States |\n| Original language | English |\n| No. of seasons | 9 |\n| No. of episodes | 208 (list of episodes) |\n| Production |\n| Executive producers | * Carter Bays\n* Craig Thomas\n* Rob Greenberg\n* Pamela Fryman\n* Eileen Heisler\n* DeAnn Heline\n* Phil Lord\n* Greg Malins\n* Christopher Miller\n* Chris Harris\n* Stephen Lloyd\n* Kourtney Kang\n* Jamie Rhonheimer\n* Chuck Tatham\n |\n| Producers | * Randy Cordray\n* Suzy Mamann Greenberg\n* Chris Harris\n* Jamie Rhonheimer\n* Kourtney Kang\n* Brenda Hsueh\n* Theresa Mulligan Rosenthal\n* Stewart Halpern-Fingerhut\n* Rob Greenberg\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n## External links[edit]\n\n\n**How I Met Your Mother** at Wikipedia's sister projects\n\n* ![](image)Media from Commons\n* ![](image)Quotations from Wikiquote\n* ![](image)Data from Wikidata\n\n* How I Met Your Mother at Curlie\n* *How I Met Your Mother* at IMDb ![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\n* *How I Met Your Dad* at IMDb ![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n*How I Met Your Mother*\n |\n| --- |\n| Episodes | * Season 1\n* 2\n* 3\n* 4\n* 5\n* 6\n* 7\n* 8\n* 9\n |\n| Characters | * Ted Mosby\n* Marshall Eriksen\n* Lily Aldrin\n* Barney Stinson\n* Robin Scherbatsky\n* Tracy McConnell\n |\n| Soundtracks | * \"Let's Go to the Mall\"\n* \"Sandcastles in the Sand\"\n* \"Nothing Suits Me Like a Suit\"\n* \"P.S.

These include the long-lasting couple Marshall Eriksen (Jason Segel), a law student and Lily Aldrin (Alyson Hannigan), a kindergarten teacher, who have been dating for almost nine years when Marshall proposes, as well as womanizing playboy Barney Stinson (Neil Patrick Harris), and Canadian news reporter Robin Scherbatsky (Cobie Smulders). All of the characters' lives are entwined. The series explores many storylines, including a \"will they or won't they\" relationship between Robin and each of the two single male friends, Marshall and Lily's relationship, and the ups and downs of the characters' careers.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAccording to an *Entertainment Weekly* article, the writers adopted facets of each main actor's personality and incorporated them into their characters. This includes Neil Patrick Harris' skills with magic, Jason Segel's passion for songwriting, Alyson Hannigan's absent-mindedness while pregnant, and Josh Radnor's intellectualism.[14]\n\n\nMacLaren's, an Irish bar in the middle of New York City, in which a lot of the show is set, is loosely based on four favorite bars of Bays, Thomas, and others' from the *Late Show* staff. Others include: McGee's, a Midtown tavern near the Ed Sullivan Theater where the *Late Show* is taped; McHale's, a legendary Hell's Kitchen bar which closed in 2006; Chumley's, a since-closed historic Greenwich Village pub; and Fez, another closed bar on the Upper West Side.[15] McGee's had a mural that Bays and Thomas both liked and wanted to incorporate into the show.[16] The name for the bar is from Carter Bays' assistant, Carl MacLaren; the bartender in the show is also named Carl.[17]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn September 2008, Lifetime Television announced it had purchased the cable rerun rights to *How I Met Your Mother* at a rate of about $725,000 per episode.[28] The four-year syndication contract stipulated that the studio deliver at least 110 half-hour episodes by 2010 and allowed for up to eight seasons of the show. At the end of the fourth season only 88 episodes had been produced, and a further 22 episodes were required, ensuring that there would be a fifth season.[29] There also was a complication with the writing of the show because of actress Alyson Hannigan's absence due to her pregnancy; in response, the writers had to create episodes that did not include one of the five main characters.[30] On May 19, 2009, the fifth-season renewal was announced.[31] May 20, 2009, CBS announced that *How I Met Your Mother* would again be aired at 8 pm, leading into the new comedy *Accidentally on Purpose*. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"TV Summer School: How to Create and Run a Successful Sitcom\". *E!

The series, which aired from September 19, 2005 to March 31, 2014, follows the main character, Ted Mosby, and his group of friends in New York City's Manhattan. As a framing device, Ted, in 2030, recounts to his son, Luke, and daughter, Penny, the events from September 2005 to May 2013 that led him to meet their mother. *How I Met Your Mother* was a joint production by Bays & Thomas Productions and 20th Century Fox Television, and syndicated by 20th Television (now Disney-ABC Domestic Television).\n\n\nThe series was loosely inspired by Thomas and Bays' friendship when they both lived in New York.[1] The vast majority of the episodes (196 out of 208) were directed by Pamela Fryman. The other directors were Rob Greenberg (7 episodes), Michael Shea (4 episodes), and Neil Patrick Harris (1 episode).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| *How I Met Your Mother* |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)The cast pictured in the opening sequence\n |\n| Genre | * Sitcom\n* Romantic comedy\n* Comedy drama\n |\n| Created by | * Carter Bays\n* Craig Thomas\n |\n| Starring | * Josh Radnor\n* Jason Segel\n* Cobie Smulders\n* Neil Patrick Harris\n* Alyson Hannigan\n* Cristin Milioti\n |\n| Narrated by | Bob Saget |\n| Opening theme | \"Hey, Beautiful\" by The Solids |\n| Composer | John Swihart |\n| Country of origin | United States |\n| Original language | English |\n| No. of seasons | 9 |\n| No. of episodes | 208 (list of episodes) |\n| Production |\n| Executive producers | * Carter Bays\n* Craig Thomas\n* Rob Greenberg\n* Pamela Fryman\n* Eileen Heisler\n* DeAnn Heline\n* Phil Lord\n* Greg Malins\n* Christopher Miller\n* Chris Harris\n* Stephen Lloyd\n* Kourtney Kang\n* Jamie Rhonheimer\n* Chuck Tatham\n |\n| Producers | * Randy Cordray\n* Suzy Mamann Greenberg\n* Chris Harris\n* Jamie Rhonheimer\n* Kourtney Kang\n* Brenda Hsueh\n* Theresa Mulligan Rosenthal\n* Stewart Halpern-Fingerhut\n* Rob Greenberg\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n## External links[edit]\n\n\n**How I Met Your Mother** at Wikipedia's sister projects\n\n* ![](image)Media from Commons\n* ![](image)Quotations from Wikiquote\n* ![](image)Data from Wikidata\n\n* How I Met Your Mother at Curlie\n* *How I Met Your Mother* at IMDb ![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\n* *How I Met Your Dad* at IMDb ![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n*How I Met Your Mother*\n |\n| --- |\n| Episodes | * Season 1\n* 2\n* 3\n* 4\n* 5\n* 6\n* 7\n* 8\n* 9\n |\n| Characters | * Ted Mosby\n* Marshall Eriksen\n* Lily Aldrin\n* Barney Stinson\n* Robin Scherbatsky\n* Tracy McConnell\n |\n| Soundtracks | * \"Let's Go to the Mall\"\n* \"Sandcastles in the Sand\"\n* \"Nothing Suits Me Like a Suit\"\n* \"P.S.
