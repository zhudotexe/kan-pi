In 2009, a peer-reviewed article, was published, concluding that the Nile is longer than the Amazon by stating a length of 7,088 km (4,404 mi) for the Nile and 6,575 km (4,086 mi) for the Amazon, measured by using a combination of satellite image analysis and field investigations to the source regions.[3]\nAccording to the Encyclopædia Britannica, the final length of the Amazon remains open to interpretation and continued debate.[2][20]\n\n\n\n## Watershed[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Amazon basin\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n2. **^** The Nile is usually said to be the longest river in the world, with a length of about 6,650 km,[17] and the Amazon the second longest river in the world, with a length of at least 6,400 km.[2] In 2007 and 2008, some scientists claimed that the Amazon has a length of 6,992 km and was longer than the Nile, whose length was calculated as 6,853 km.[18][19] They achieved this result by adding the waterway from the Amazon's southern outlet through tidal canals and the Pará estuary of the Tocantins.[*citation needed*]\nA peer-reviewed article, published in 2009, states a length of 7,088 km for the Nile and 6,575 km for the Amazon, measured by using a combination of satellite image analysis and field investigations to the source regions.[3]\nAccording to the Encyclopædia Britannica, as of 2020, the length of the Amazon remains open to interpretation and continued debate.[2][20]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** The length of the Amazon River is usually said to be \"at least\" 6,400 km (4,000 mi),[2] but reported values lie anywhere between 6,275 and 7,025 km (3,899 and 4,365 mi).[3]\nThe length measurements of many rivers are only approximations and differ from each other because there are many factors that determine the calculated river length, such as the position of the geographical source and the mouth, the scale of measurement, and the length measuring techniques (for details see also List of rivers by length).[3][4]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWhile debate as to whether the Amazon or the Nile is the world's longest river has gone on for many years, the historic consensus of geographic authorities has been to regard the Amazon as the second longest river in the world, with the Nile being the longest.
