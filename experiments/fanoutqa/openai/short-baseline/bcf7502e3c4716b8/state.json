In the case of some rivers such as the Columbia, the length listed in the table below is solely that of the main stem. In the case of others such as the Mackenzie, it is the combined lengths of the main stem and one or more upstream tributaries, as noted. Excluded from the list are rivers such as the Dauphin, a short connecting link between lakes Manitoba and Winnipeg, with main stems of 100\u00a0km (62\u00a0mi) or less. Also excluded are rivers such as the Mississippi, the main stems of which do not enter Canada even though some of their tributaries do.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | Yukon River | Bering Sea62\u00b035\u203255\u2033N 164\u00b048\u203200\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff62.59861\u00b0N 164.80000\u00b0W\ufeff / 62.59861; -164.80000\ufeff (Yukon River (mouth))[8] | 3,185\u00a0km1,979\u00a0mi\u2020[n 3] | Teslin Lake59\u00b037\u203200\u2033N 132\u00b009\u203200\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff59.61667\u00b0N 132.15000\u00b0W\ufeff / 59.61667; -132.15000\ufeff (Yukon River (source)) | 839,200\u00a0km2324,000\u00a0mi2\u2021[n 4] | 6,340\u00a0m3/s224,000\u00a0ft3/s[9] | British Columbia, Yukon, *Alaska* | ![Sunset over a large river flowing through mountains.](image) |\n| 3\n | Saint Lawrence River | Gulf of Saint Lawrence49\u00b040\u203200\u2033N 64\u00b030\u203200\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff49.66667\u00b0N 64.50000\u00b0W\ufeff / 49.66667; -64.50000\ufeff (Saint Lawrence River (mouth))[10] | 3,058\u00a0km1,900\u00a0mi\u2020[n 5] | Seven Beaver Lake47\u00b030\u203204\u2033N 91\u00b049\u203251\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff47.50111\u00b0N 91.83083\u00b0W\ufeff / 47.50111; -91.83083\ufeff (Saint Louis River (source))[11] | 1,344,200\u00a0km2519,000\u00a0mi2\u2021[n 6] | 9,850\u00a0m3/s348,000\u00a0ft3/s | *Minnesota*, *Wisconsin*, Ontario, *Michigan*, *Ohio*, *New York*, Quebec | ![A large ship travels along a large river bordered by vegetation on one bank and urban development on the other.](image) |\n| 4\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n15. **^** To the head of Churchill Lake.[7]\n16. **^** To the head of the Bow River.[7]\n17. **^** Split between 144,300\u00a0km2 (55,700\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) (about 99\u00a0percent) in Canada and 1,800\u00a0km2 (690\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) (about 1\u00a0percent) in the United States.[7]\n18. **^** Split between 232,300\u00a0km2 (89,700\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) (about 99.7\u00a0percent) in Canada and 800\u00a0km2 (310\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) (about 0.3\u00a0percent) in the United States.[7]\n19. **^** *Rivers of North America* lists a basin size of 154,880 square kilometres (59,800\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), but this includes Lake Athabasca, the Peace\u2013Athabasca Delta, and the basins of the Fond du Lac River and some of the other streams flowing into the lake.[26]\n20. **^** Split between 160,600\u00a0km2 (62,000\u00a0mi2) (about 88\u00a0percent) in Canada and 21,400\u00a0km2 (8,300\u00a0mi2) (about 12\u00a0percent) in the United States.[7]\n21. **^** According to the Milk River Watershed Council, a 180-km (110\u00a0mi) stretch of the river flows through Canada.

The dividing line is generally considered to be the Ural Mountains. The European part is drained into the Arctic Ocean, Baltic Sea, Black Sea, and Caspian Sea. The Asian part is drained into the Arctic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean.\n\n\nNotable rivers of Russia in Europe are Volga (which is the longest river in Europe), Pechora, Don, Kama, Oka and the Northern Dvina, while several other rivers originate in Russia but flow into other countries, such as the Dnieper and the Western Dvina.\n\n\nIn Asia, important rivers are the Ob, the Irtysh, the Yenisei, the Angara, the Lena, the Amur, the Yana, the Indigirka, and the Kolyma.\n\n\nIn the list below, the rivers are grouped by the seas or oceans into which they flow. Rivers that flow into other rivers are ordered by the proximity of their point of confluence to the mouth of the main river, i.e., the lower in the list, the more upstream.\n\n\n\nThere is an

In 2009, a peer-reviewed article, was published, concluding that the Nile is longer than the Amazon by stating a length of 7,088\u00a0km (4,404\u00a0mi) for the Nile and 6,575\u00a0km (4,086\u00a0mi) for the Amazon, measured by using a combination of satellite image analysis and field investigations to the source regions.[3]\nAccording to the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, the final length of the Amazon remains open to interpretation and continued debate.[2][20]\n\n\n\n## Watershed[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Amazon basin\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n2. **^** The Nile is usually said to be the longest river in the world, with a length of about 6,650 km,[17] and the Amazon the second longest river in the world, with a length of at least 6,400 km.[2] In 2007 and 2008, some scientists claimed that the Amazon has a length of 6,992\u00a0km and was longer than the Nile, whose length was calculated as 6,853\u00a0km.[18][19] They achieved this result by adding the waterway from the Amazon's southern outlet through tidal canals and the Par\u00e1 estuary of the Tocantins.[*citation needed*]\nA peer-reviewed article, published in 2009, states a length of 7,088 km for the Nile and 6,575 km for the Amazon, measured by using a combination of satellite image analysis and field investigations to the source regions.[3]\nAccording to the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, as of 2020, the length of the Amazon remains open to interpretation and continued debate.[2][20]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** The length of the Amazon River is usually said to be \"at least\" 6,400\u00a0km (4,000\u00a0mi),[2] but reported values lie anywhere between 6,275 and 7,025\u00a0km (3,899 and 4,365\u00a0mi).[3]\nThe length measurements of many rivers are only approximations and differ from each other because there are many factors that determine the calculated river length, such as the position of the geographical source and the mouth, the scale of measurement, and the length measuring techniques (for details see also List of rivers by length).[3][4]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWhile debate as to whether the Amazon or the Nile is the world's longest river has gone on for many years, the historic consensus of geographic authorities has been to regard the Amazon as the second longest river in the world, with the Nile being the longest.

The Amazon's length was calculated as 6,992\u00a0km (4,345\u00a0mi), taking the Apacheta Creek as its source. Using the same techniques, the length of the Nile was calculated as 6,853\u00a0km (4,258\u00a0mi), which is longer than previous estimates but still shorter than the Amazon. The results were reached by measuring the Amazon downstream to the beginning of the tidal estuary of *Canal do Sul* and then, after a sharp turn back, following tidal canals surrounding the isle of Maraj\u00f3 and finally including the marine waters of the *R\u00edo Par\u00e1* bay in its entire length.[58][20] According to an earlier article on the webpage of the National Geographic, the Amazon's length was calculated as 6,800\u00a0km (4,200\u00a0mi) by a Brazilian scientist. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Topography of the Amazon River Basin\nThe **Amazon River** (UK: /\u02c8\u00e6m\u0259z\u0259n/, US: /\u02c8\u00e6m\u0259z\u0252n/; Spanish: *R\u00edo Amazonas*, Portuguese: *Rio Amazonas*) in South America is the largest river by discharge volume of water in the world, and the disputed longest river system in the world in comparison to the Nile.[2][16][n 2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nEleven to ten million years ago, waters worked through the sandstone from the west and the Amazon began to flow eastward, leading to the emergence of the Amazon rainforest. During glacial periods, sea levels dropped and the great Amazon lake rapidly drained and became a river, which would eventually become the disputed world's longest, draining the most extensive area of rainforest on the planet.[79]\n\n\nParalleling the Amazon River is a large aquifer, dubbed the Hamza River, the discovery of which was made public in August 2011.[80]\n\n\n\n## Protected areas[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
