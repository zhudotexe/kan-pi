On August 1, 2014, P&G announced it was streamlining the company, dropping and selling off around 100 brands from its product portfolio in order to focus on the remaining 65 brands,[5] which produced 95% of the company's profits. A.G. Lafley, the company's chairman and CEO until October 2015, said the future P&G would be \"a much simpler, much less complex company of leading brands that's easier to manage and operate\".[6]\n\n\nJon Moeller is the current president and CEO of P&G.[7]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Origins[edit]\n\n\nCandlemaker William Procter, born in England, and soap maker James Gamble, born in Ireland, both emigrated to the US from the United Kingdom. They initially settled in Cincinnati, Ohio, and met when they married sisters Olivia and Elizabeth Norris.[8] Alexander Norris, their father-in-law, persuaded them to become business partners, and in 1837, Procter & Gamble was created.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe company has actively developed or sponsored numerous online communities,[87] e.g. BeingGirl.com (launched in 2000)[88] and Women.com.[87] As of 2000[update], the company had 72 \"highly stylized destination sites\".[89]\n\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\n### Price fixing[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2011, P&G was fined \u20ac211.2 million by the European Commission for establishing a price-fixing cartel for washing powder in Europe along with Unilever, which was fined \u20ac104\u00a0million, and Henkel. Though the fine was set higher at first, it was discounted by 10% after P&G and Unilever admitted running the cartel. As the provider of the tip-off leading to investigations, Henkel was not fined.[90]\n\n\n\n### Toxic shock syndrome and tampons[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLater that same year in July, the company announced the sale of 43 of its beauty brands to Coty, a beauty-product manufacturer, in a US$13\u00a0billion deal. It cited sluggish growth of its beauty division as the reason for the divestiture.[30][31][32] The sale was completed on October 3, 2016.[33]\n\n\nIn February 2016, P&G completed the transfer of Duracell to Berkshire Hathaway through an exchange of shares.[34]\n\n\nIn December 2018, Procter & Gamble completed the acquisition of the consumer health division of Merck Group (known as EMD Serono in North America) for \u20ac3.4 billion ($4.2 billion) and renamed it as Procter & Gamble Health Limited in May 2019.[35][36]\n\n\nIn November 2018, P&G unveiled a simpler corporate structure with six business units that will be effective from July 2019.[37]\n\n\n\n## Finances[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Tax inversion | * Actavis (Ireland, 2013)\n* Alkermes (Ireland, 2011)\n* Allergan (Ireland, 2015)\n* Covidien (Ireland, 2007)\n* Endo International (Ireland, 2014)\n* Horizon Therapeutics (Ireland, 2014)\n* Jazz Pharmaceuticals (Ireland, 2012)\n* Mallinckrodt (Ireland, 2013)\n* Perrigo (Ireland, 2013)\n* Bausch Health (Canada, 2010)\n |\n| Other | * Alza\n* Allergan, Inc.\n* Amylin\n* ARIAD\n* Barr\n* Biolex\n* Bradley\n* CancerVax\n* Cephalon\n* CoTherix\n* Covance\n* Cubist\n* Cutter Laboratories\n* DNAPrint Genomics\n* Epix\n* Forest Laboratories\n* Genta\n* ImClone Systems\n* ISTA\n* King\n* KV\n* Leiner Health Products\n* Martek Biosciences\n* Massengill\n* Miles Laboratories\n* Mylan\n* Naurex\n* Nereus\n* Nuvelo\n* Ortho\n* OSI\n* Parke-Davis\n* Repros Therapeutics\n* Qualitest\n* Rib-X\n* Schering-Plough\n* Smith, Kline & French\n* Sterling Drug\n* Tanox\n* TAP\n* Trubion\n* Upjohn\n* Verus\n* ViroPharma\n* Wyeth\n* Zonite\n |\n\n |\n| * List of pharmaceutical companies\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

During the second half of the 20th century, the company increasingly diversified from being a maker of products made of oils and fats, and expanded its operations worldwide. It has made numerous corporate acquisitions, including Lipton (1971), Brooke Bond (1984), Chesebrough-Ponds (1987), Hellmann's (2000), Ben & Jerry's (2000), Slim-Fast (2000), Knorr (2000), Alberto-Culver (2010), Dollar Shave Club (2016), and Pukka Herbs (2017). Unilever divested its specialty chemicals businesses to Imperial Chemical Industries in 1997. In the 2010s, under the leadership of Paul Polman, the company gradually shifted its focus towards health and beauty brands and away from food brands that showed slow growth.[6]\n\n\nUnilever has a primary listing on the London Stock Exchange and a secondary listing on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index and the AEX index.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nUnilever's largest brands include Axe (Lynx), Ben & Jerry's, Dove, Hellmann's, Knorr, Lifebuoy, Lux, Magnum, Omo (Persil), Rexona, Sunlight, Sunsilk, and Wall's (Heartbrand).[4] The company is organised into five business groups: Beauty & Wellbeing, Personal Care, Home Care, Nutrition, and Ice Cream. It has research and development facilities in China, India, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States.[5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2015, Unilever acquired British niche skincare brand REN Skincare,[54] This was followed in May 2015 by the acquisition of Kate Somerville Skincare LLC.[55] The company also acquired the Italian premium ice cream maker GROM for an undisclosed amount.[56] Unilever also separated its food spreads business,[57] including its Flora and I Can't Believe It's Not Butter! brands, into a standalone entity named Unilever Baking, Cooking and Spreading.[58] The separation was first announced in December 2014 and was made in response to declining worldwide sales in that product category.[59]\n\n\nUnilever bought the United States-based startup company Dollar Shave Club for a reported $1b (\u00a3764m) to compete in the male grooming market.[60] On 16 August 2016, Unilever acquired Blueair, a supplier of mobile indoor air purification technologies.[61] In September 2016, Unilever acquired Seventh Generation Inc. for $700\u00a0million.[62] On 16 December 2016, Unilever acquired Living Proof Inc, a hair care products business.[63]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBy the end of the 1970s through acquisitions, Unilever had gained 30 per cent of the Western European ice cream market.[11] In 1982, Unilever management decided to reposition itself from an unwieldy conglomerate to a more concentrated fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) company.[19]\n\n\nIn 1984, Unilever acquired Brooke Bond (maker of PG Tips tea) for \u00a3390\u00a0million in the company's first successful hostile takeover.[11] In 1986, Unilever strengthened its position in the world skin care market by acquiring Chesebrough-Ponds (merged from Chesebrough Manufacturing and Pond's Creams), the maker of Rag\u00fa, Pond's, Aqua-Net, Cutex, and Vaseline in another hostile takeover.[19] In 1989, Unilever bought Calvin Klein Cosmetics, Faberg\u00e9, and Elizabeth Arden, but the latter was later sold (in 2000) to FFI Fragrances.[20]\n\n\n\n### 1981\u20132000[edit]\n\n\nIn 1992, Unilever Ghana was established in July following a merger of UAC Ghana Limited and Lever Brothers Ghana Limited.[21]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSunsilk was first launched in the United Kingdom in 1954.[15] Dove was first launched in the US in 1957.[15] Unilever took full ownership of Frosted Foods in 1957, which it renamed Birds Eye.[16] The US-based Good Humor ice cream business was acquired in 1961.[17] By the mid-1960s, laundry soap and edible fats still contributed around half of Unilever's corporate profits.[11] However, a stagnant market for yellow fats (butter, margarine, and similar products) and increasing competition in detergents and soaps from Procter & Gamble forced Unilever to diversify.[11] In 1971, Unilever acquired the British-based Lipton Ltd from Allied Suppliers.[11] In 1978, National Starch was acquired for $487\u00a0million, marking the largest ever foreign-acquisition of a US company at that point.[18]\n\n\n\n### 1961\u20131980[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

With the birth of new cosmetics, the\u00a0definition of makeup started to alter in the 1920s. The cosmetics were not used exclusively by women. Men started to use makeup to rebuild their image. Shiseido's scented hair tonics were among their most popular early cosmetics for both men and women, fueled by a reaction to Western distaste for less fragrant traditional hair oil products.[10] Shiseido also began to produce floral perfumes which contributed to the brand's \"De Luxe\" and \"rich\u201d aesthetic.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)The Shiseido building in Ginza, Tokyo.

Its product categories consist of: skin care, makeup, body care, hair care, and fragrances. The company is one of the oldest cosmetic companies in the world and celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2022.[4][5] It is the largest cosmetic firm in Japan and the fifth largest cosmetic company in the world.[6] In Japan, Shiseido is available at cosmetic counters at selected department stores and most pharmacies. The company owns numerous brands and subsidiaries worldwide, in addition to its founding label. The company is headquartered in Tokyo, and is traded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, where it is a constituent of the Nikkei 225 and TOPIX Large70 indices.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Cosmetology\n* History of cosmetics\n* Cosmetic industry\n* Male cosmetics\n |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
