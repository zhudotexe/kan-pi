The Fields Medal also has an age limit: a recipient must be under age 40 on 1 January of the year in which the medal is awarded. The under-40 rule is based on Fields's desire that \"while it was in recognition of work already done, it was at the same time intended to be an encouragement for further achievement on the part of the recipients and a stimulus to renewed effort on the part of others.\"[14] Moreover, an individual can only be awarded one Fields Medal; winners are ineligible to be awarded future medals.[15]\n\n\nFirst awarded in 1936, 64 people have won the medal as of 2022.[16] With the exception of two PhD holders in physics (Edward Witten and Martin Hairer),[17] only people with a PhD in mathematics have won the medal.[18]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n## List of Fields medalists[edit]\n\n\nIn certain years, the Fields medalists have been officially cited for particular mathematical achievements, while in other years such specificities have not been given.

Manin, with the first-ever IMU silver plaque in recognition of his proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. Don Zagier referred to the plaque as a \"quantized Fields Medal\". Accounts of this award frequently make reference that at the time of the award Wiles was over the age limit for the Fields medal.[128] Although Wiles was slightly over the age limit in 1994, he was thought to be a favorite to win the medal; however, a gap (later resolved by Taylor and Wiles) in the proof was found in 1993.[129][130]\n\n\nIn 2006, Grigori Perelman, who proved the Poincaré conjecture, refused his Fields Medal[9] and did not attend the congress.[131]\n\n\nIn 2014, Maryam Mirzakhani became the first Iranian as well as the first woman to win the Fields Medal, and Artur Avila became the first South American and Manjul Bhargava became the first person of Indian origin to do so.[132][133]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n*CONGREGATI*\n*EX TOTO ORBE*\n*MATHEMATICI*\n*OB SCRIPTA INSIGNIA*\n*TRIBUERE*\nTranslation: \"Mathematicians gathered from the entire world have awarded [understood but not written: 'this prize'] for outstanding writings.\"\n\n\nIn the background, there is the representation of Archimedes' tomb, with the carving illustrating his theorem On the Sphere and Cylinder, behind an olive branch. (This is the mathematical result of which Archimedes was reportedly most proud: Given a sphere and a circumscribed cylinder of the same height and diameter, the ratio between their volumes is equal to 2⁄3.)\n\n\nThe rim bears the name of the prizewinner.[141]\n\n\n\n## Female recipients[edit]\n\n\nThe Fields Medal has had two female recipients, Maryam Mirzakhani from Iran in 2014, and Maryna Viazovska from Ukraine in 2022.[132][134]\n\n\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_TfG0OeyjqsJMv1bpNSVFPSkV","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
