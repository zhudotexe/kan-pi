It was also nominated for Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Ian McKellen), Best Art Direction, Best Director, Best Film Editing, Best Original Song (Enya, Nicky Ryan and Roma Ryan for \"May It Be\"), Best Picture, Best Sound (Christopher Boyes, Michael Semanick, Gethin Creagh and Hammond Peek), Best Costume Design and Best Adapted Screenplay.\n\n\nThe film won the 2002 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation. It also won *Empire* readers' Best Film award, as well as five BAFTAs, including Best Film, the David Lean Award for Best Direction, the Audience Award (voted for by the public), Best Special Effects, and Best Make-up. The film was nominated for an MTV Movie Award for Best Fight between Gandalf and Saruman.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Billy Boyd as Peregrin Took: Better known as Pippin, an extremely foolish hobbit who is a distant cousin of Frodo and travels with the Fellowship on their journey to Mordor.\n* Dominic Monaghan as Meriadoc Brandybuck: Better known as Merry, a distant cousin of Frodo. Monaghan was cast as Merry after auditioning for Frodo.[12]\n* John Rhys-Davies as Gimli: A dwarf warrior who accompanies the Fellowship to Mordor after they set out from Rivendell. Billy Connolly, who was considered for the part of Gimli, would later portray D\u00e1in II Ironfoot in Peter Jackson's *The Hobbit* film trilogy.[12] Rhys-Davies wore heavy prosthetics to play Gimli, which limited his vision, and eventually he developed eczema around his eyes.[7] Rhys-Davies also played Gimli's father Gl\u00f3in during the scene where the fellowship is forged.\n* Orlando Bloom as Legolas: A prince of the elves' Woodland Realm and a skilled archer. Bloom initially auditioned for Faramir, who appears in the second film, a role which went to David Wenham.[12]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The eponymous Fellowship from left to right: (Top row) Aragorn, Gandalf, Legolas, Boromir, (bottom row) Sam, Frodo, Merry, Pippin, Gimli\nBefore filming began on 11 October 1999, the principal actors trained for six weeks in sword fighting (with Bob Anderson), riding and boating. Jackson hoped such activities would allow the cast to bond so chemistry would be evident on screen as well as getting them used to life in Wellington.[7] They were also trained to pronounce Tolkien's verses properly.[8] After the shoot, the nine cast members playing the Fellowship got a tattoo, the Elvish symbol for the number nine, with the exception of John Rhys-Davies, whose stunt double got the tattoo instead.[9] The film is noted for having an ensemble cast,[10] and some of the cast and their respective characters include:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Hugo Weaving as Elrond: The Elven-Lord of Rivendell who leads the Council of Elrond, which ultimately decides to destroy the Ring. David Bowie expressed interest in the role, but Jackson stated, \"To have a famous, beloved character and a famous star colliding is slightly uncomfortable.\"[13]\n* Ian Holm as Bilbo Baggins: Frodo's uncle who gives him the Ring after he decides to retire to Rivendell. Holm previously played Frodo in a 1981 radio adaption of *The Lord of the Rings*, and was cast as Bilbo after Jackson remembered his performance.[12] Sylvester McCoy, who would later play Radagast the Brown in *The Hobbit*, was contacted about playing the role, and was kept in place as a potential Bilbo for six months before Jackson went with Holm.[28]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMortensen's son, a fan of the book, convinced him to take the role.[7] Mortensen read the book on the plane, received a crash course lesson in fencing from Bob Anderson and began filming the scenes on Weathertop.[23] Mortensen became a hit with the crew by patching up his costume[24] and carrying his \"hero\" sword around with him off-camera.[7]\n* Sean Astin as Samwise Gamgee: Better known as Sam, a hobbit gardener and Frodo's best friend. Astin, who had recently become a father, bonded with the 18-year-old Wood in a protective manner, which mirrored Sam's relationship with Frodo.[7] before Astin was cast, James Corden read for the part.[25]\n* Sean Bean as Boromir: A son of the Stewards of Gondor who journeys with the Fellowship towards Mordor. Bruce Willis, a fan of the book, expressed interest in the role, while Liam Neeson was sent the script, but passed.[12]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Liv Tyler as Arwen: An elf of Rivendell and Aragorn's lover. The filmmakers approached Tyler after seeing her performance in *Plunkett & Macleane*, and New Line Cinema leaped at the opportunity of having one Hollywood star in the film. Actress Helena Bonham Carter had expressed interest in the role.[12] Tyler came to shoot on short occasions, unlike the rest of the actors. She was one of the last actors to be cast, on 25 August 1999.[26]\n* Cate Blanchett as Galadriel: The elven co-ruler of Lothl\u00f3rien alongside her husband Celeborn. Lucy Lawless was considered for the role.[27]\n* Christopher Lee as Saruman the White: The fallen head of the Istari Order who succumbs to Sauron's will through his use of the *palant\u00edr*. Lee was a major fan of the book, and read it once a year. He had also met J. R. R. Tolkien.[23] He originally auditioned for Gandalf, but was judged too old.[12]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Sala Baker as Sauron:[30] The Dark Lord of Mordor and the Ring's true master, who manifests as an Eye after the destruction of his physical form.\n* Marton Csokas as Celeborn the Wise: The Elven-Lord of Lothl\u00f3rien and Galadriel's husband.\n* Lawrence Makoare as Lurtz: The commander of Saruman's Uruk-Hai forces.\n* Craig Parker as Haldir: The leader of the Galadhrim warriors guarding the border of Lothl\u00f3rien.\n* Mark Ferguson as Ereinion Gil-galad: The last Elven-King of the Noldor.\n* Peter McKenzie as Elendil the Tall: The last High King of Arnor and Gondor.\n* Harry Sinclair as Isildur: Elendil's son and Aragorn's ancestor who originally defeated Sauron.\n* Director Peter Jackson has a small cameo as a man with a carrot in Bree.\n\n\n## Comparison to the source material[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Peter Jackson's interpretation of The Lord of the Rings\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n25. **^** \"James Corden Auditioned for 'Lord of the Rings' to Play Samwise, Says He Got Two Callbacks: It Was 'Not Good'\". 29 December 2022.\n26. **^** \"Liv Tyler will be in LOTR \u2013 Updated\".

Frodo wanders off and is confronted by Boromir, who, as Lady Galadriel had warned, tries to take the Ring. Uruk-hai scouts then ambush the Fellowship, attempting to abduct the Hobbits. Boromir breaks free of the Ring's magic and protects Merry and Pippin, but the Uruk-Hai leader, Lurtz, mortally wounds Boromir as they abduct the Hobbits. Aragorn arrives and kills Lurtz before comforting Boromir as he dies, promising to help the people of Gondor in the coming conflict. Fearing the Ring will corrupt his friends, Frodo decides to travel to Mordor alone, but allows Sam to come along, recalling his promise to Gandalf to look after him. As Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli set out to rescue Merry and Pippin, Frodo and Sam make their way down the mountain pass of Emyn Muil, journeying on to Mordor. \n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Cast of *The Lord of the Rings* film series\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | 178 minutes[2] |\n| Countries | * New Zealand[1]\n* United States[1]\n |\n| Language | English |\n| Budget | $93\u00a0million[3] |\n| Box office | $898.2\u00a0million[4] |\n\n\n***The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring*** is a 2001 epic fantasy adventure film directed by Peter Jackson from a screenplay by Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens, and Jackson, based on 1954's *The Fellowship of the Ring*, the first volume of the novel *The Lord of the Rings* by J.

R. R. Tolkien's multi-volume novel. Wood was a fan of the book series, and he sent in an audition dressed as Frodo, reading lines from the novel.[22] He was selected from 150 actors who auditioned.[23] Wood was the first actor to be cast.[24] This gave Wood top billing, alongside a cast that included Ian McKellen, Liv Tyler, Orlando Bloom, Cate Blanchett, Christopher Lee, Miranda Otto, Sean Bean, Sean Astin, Billy Boyd, Dominic Monaghan, Viggo Mortensen, and John Rhys-Davies.[25][26][27] \nThe *Lord of the Rings* trilogy was filmed in New Zealand, in a process taking more than one year for principal photography alone, with pick-up shots annually for the next four years.[28][29]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBefore the cast left the country, Jackson gave Wood two gifts: one of the One Ring props used on the set and Sting, Frodo's sword. He was also given a pair of prosthetic \"hobbit feet\" of the type worn during filming.[30]\n\n\nIn 2002, Wood lent his voice to the DTV release of *The Adventures of Tom Thumb and Thumbelina*. Later that year, the second part of Peter Jackson's trilogy was released, titled *The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers*, in which Wood had a reduced role from the first movie. \nIn 2003, Wood starred in the DTV film *All I Want* and also cameoed as 'The Guy' in *Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over*. The concluding chapter of the *Rings* trilogy, *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King* was released that December.[31]\n\n\n\n### 2004\u2013present[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
