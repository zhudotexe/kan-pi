Their work has been well-received by audiences and recognized with numerous awards. Their mascot and most recognizable symbol, the character Totoro, is a giant spirit inspired by raccoon dogs (*tanuki*) and cats[5] from the 1988 film *My Neighbor Totoro*. Among the studio's highest-grossing films are *Spirited Away* (2001), *Howl's Moving Castle* (2004), and *Ponyo* (2008).[6] Studio Ghibli was founded on June 15, 1985, by the directors Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata and producer Toshio Suzuki, after acquiring Topcraft's assets. The studio has also collaborated with video game studios on the visual development of several games.[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nStudio Ghibli films are mostly hand-drawn using rich water and acrylic paints. The films use traditional methods of making animation where every frame is drawn and colored by hand. Computer animation techniques are used sparingly.[138] All the Studio Ghibli films use bright colors,[139][140] and have a \"whimsical and joyful aesthetic\".[141] Studio Ghibli’s art style tends to be more of a cozy European style that put a lot of undertones on the background and nature in the scene.[142]\n\n\nThe films often focus on the lives of youth, especially school children. Common themes include the risks posed by progress to tradition,[143] environmentalism and the natural world,[143][141] independent female protagonists,[139] the cost of war, and youth.[140]\n\n\n\n## Criticism[edit]\n\n\nRayna Denison argues that, despite the feminist themes of Ghibli films, the studio has been reluctant to promote women within the company and regularly overworks its laborers, including on public holidays.[144]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Director\n | Screenwriter(s)\n | Producer(s)\n | Composer\n | Original release\n | RT | MC |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1984\n | *Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind* | Hayao Miyazaki | Isao Takahata | Joe Hisaishi | March 11, 1984\n | 90%[87] | 86[88] |\n| 1986\n | *Castle in the Sky* | August 2, 1986\n | 96%[89] | 78[90] |\n| 1988\n | *My Neighbor Totoro* | Tōru Hara\n | April 16, 1988\n | 93%[91] | 86[92] |\n| *Grave of the Fireflies* | Isao Takahata | Michio Mamiya | 100%[93] | 94[94] |\n| 1989\n | *Kiki's Delivery Service* | Hayao Miyazaki | Joe Hisaishi | July 29, 1989\n | 98%[95] | 83[96] |\n| 1991\n | *Only Yesterday* | Isao Takahata | Toshio Suzuki | Katz Hoshi\n | July 20, 1991\n | 100%[97] | 90[98] |\n| 1992\n | *Porco Rosso* | Hayao Miyazaki | Joe Hisaishi | July 18, 1992\n | 96%[99] | 83[100] |\n| 1993\n | *Ocean Waves* | Tomomi Mochizuki | Seiji OkudaNozomu Takahashi\n | Shigeru Nagata\n | May 5, 1993[A] | 89%[101] | 73[102] |\n| 1994\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n140. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Studio Ghibli Movies – A Deep Analysis of the Themes\". *Pop Up Tee*.

In February 2017, Suzuki announced that Miyazaki had come out of retirement to direct a new feature film, *The Boy and the Heron* (2023).[9][10] In September 2023, Nippon TV announced that Studio Ghibli would become a unit of Nippon Television Holdings in October.[11]\n\n\n\n\n## Name[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | *Pom Poko* | Isao Takahata | Shang Shang Typhoon | July 16, 1994\n | 86%[103] | 77[104] |\n| 1995\n | *Whisper of the Heart* | Yoshifumi Kondō | Hayao Miyazaki | Yuji Nomi | July 15, 1995\n | 94%[105] | 75[106] |\n| 1997\n | *Princess Mononoke* | Hayao Miyazaki | Joe Hisaishi | July 12, 1997\n | 93%[107] | 76[108] |\n| 1999\n | *My Neighbors the Yamadas* | Isao Takahata | Akiko Yano | July 17, 1999\n | 78%[109] | 75[110] |\n| 2001\n | *Spirited Away* | Hayao Miyazaki | Joe Hisaishi | July 20, 2001\n | 96%[111] | 96[112] |\n| 2002\n | *The Cat Returns* | Hiroyuki Morita | Reiko Yoshida | Toshio SuzukiNozomu Takahashi\n | Yuji Nomi | July 19, 2002\n | 88%[113] | 70[114] |\n| 2004\n | *Howl's Moving Castle* | Hayao Miyazaki | Toshio Suzuki | Joe Hisaishi | November 20, 2004\n | 87%[115] | 82[116] |\n| 2006\n | *Tales from Earthsea* | Gorō Miyazaki | Gorō MiyazakiKeiko Niwa\n | Tamiya Terashima\n | July 29, 2006\n | 38%[117] | 47[118] |\n| 2008\n | *Ponyo* | Hayao Miyazaki | Joe Hisaishi | July 19, 2008\n | 91%[119] | 86[120] |\n| 2010\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | *Arrietty* | Hiromasa Yonebayashi | Hayao MiyazakiKeiko Niwa\n | Cécile Corbel | July 17, 2010\n | 94%[121] | 80[122] |\n| 2011\n | *From Up on Poppy Hill* | Gorō Miyazaki | Satoshi Takebe | July 16, 2011\n | 87%[123] | 71[124] |\n| 2013\n | *The Wind Rises* | Hayao Miyazaki | Joe Hisaishi | July 20, 2013\n | 88%[125] | 83[126] |\n| *The Tale of the Princess Kaguya* | Isao Takahata | Isao TakahataRiko Sakaguchi\n | Yoshiaki Nishimura | November 23, 2013\n | 100%[127] | 89[128] |\n| 2014\n | *When Marnie Was There* | Hiromasa Yonebayashi | Hiromasa YonebayashiKeiko NiwaMasashi Ando | Takatsugu Muramatsu\n | July 19, 2014\n | 92%[129] | 72[130] |\n| 2016\n | *The Red Turtle* | Michaël Dudok de Wit | Michaël Dudok de WitPascale Ferran | Toshio SuzukiIsao TakahataVincent MaravalPascal CaucheteuxGrégoire Sorlat\n | Laurent Perez del Mar\n | May 18, 2016\n | 93%[131] | 86[132] |\n| 2020\n | *Earwig and the Witch* | Gorō Miyazaki | Keiko NiwaEmi Gunji\n | Toshio Suzuki\n | Satoshi Takebe\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Studio Ghibli, Inc.** (Japanese: 株式会社スタジオジブリ, Hepburn: *Kabushiki gaisha Sutajio Jiburi*)[3] is a Japanese animation studio based in Koganei, Tokyo.[4] It has a strong presence in the animation industry and has expanded its portfolio to include various media formats, such as short subjects, television commercials, and two television films. Their work has been well-received by audiences and recognized with numerous awards. Their mascot and most recognizable symbol, the character Totoro, is a giant spirit inspired by raccoon dogs (*tanuki*) and cats[5] from the 1988 film *My Neighbor Totoro*. Among the studio's highest-grossing films are *Spirited Away* (2001), *Howl's Moving Castle* (2004), and *Ponyo* (2008).[6] Studio Ghibli was founded on June 15, 1985, by the directors Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata and producer Toshio Suzuki, after acquiring Topcraft's assets. The studio has also collaborated with video game studios on the visual development of several games.[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nStudio Ghibli films are mostly hand-drawn using rich water and acrylic paints. The films use traditional methods of making animation where every frame is drawn and colored by hand. Computer animation techniques are used sparingly.[138] All the Studio Ghibli films use bright colors,[139][140] and have a \"whimsical and joyful aesthetic\".[141] Studio Ghibli’s art style tends to be more of a cozy European style that put a lot of undertones on the background and nature in the scene.[142]\n\n\nThe films often focus on the lives of youth, especially school children. Common themes include the risks posed by progress to tradition,[143] environmentalism and the natural world,[143][141] independent female protagonists,[139] the cost of war, and youth.[140]\n\n\n\n## Criticism[edit]\n\n\nRayna Denison argues that, despite the feminist themes of Ghibli films, the studio has been reluctant to promote women within the company and regularly overworks its laborers, including on public holidays.[144]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Director\n | Screenwriter(s)\n | Producer(s)\n | Composer\n | Original release\n | RT | MC |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1984\n | *Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind* | Hayao Miyazaki | Isao Takahata | Joe Hisaishi | March 11, 1984\n | 90%[87] | 86[88] |\n| 1986\n | *Castle in the Sky* | August 2, 1986\n | 96%[89] | 78[90] |\n| 1988\n | *My Neighbor Totoro* | Tōru Hara\n | April 16, 1988\n | 93%[91] | 86[92] |\n| *Grave of the Fireflies* | Isao Takahata | Michio Mamiya | 100%[93] | 94[94] |\n| 1989\n | *Kiki's Delivery Service* | Hayao Miyazaki | Joe Hisaishi | July 29, 1989\n | 98%[95] | 83[96] |\n| 1991\n | *Only Yesterday* | Isao Takahata | Toshio Suzuki | Katz Hoshi\n | July 20, 1991\n | 100%[97] | 90[98] |\n| 1992\n | *Porco Rosso* | Hayao Miyazaki | Joe Hisaishi | July 18, 1992\n | 96%[99] | 83[100] |\n| 1993\n | *Ocean Waves* | Tomomi Mochizuki | Seiji OkudaNozomu Takahashi\n | Shigeru Nagata\n | May 5, 1993[A] | 89%[101] | 73[102] |\n| 1994\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n140. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Studio Ghibli Movies – A Deep Analysis of the Themes\". *Pop Up Tee*.
