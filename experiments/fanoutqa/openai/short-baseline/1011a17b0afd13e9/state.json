It was based on measurements done at the Pavillon de Breteuil near Paris in 1888, with a theoretical correction applied in order to convert to a latitude of 45\u00b0 at sea level.[8] This definition is thus not a value of any particular place or carefully worked out average, but an agreement for a value to use if a better actual local value is not known or not important.[9] It is also used to define the units kilogram force and pound force.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCalculating the gravity at Earth's surface using the average radius of Earth (6,371 kilometres (3,959\u00a0mi)),[10] the experimentally determined value of the gravitational constant, and the Earth mass of 5.9722 \u00d71024 kg gives an acceleration of 9.8203 m/s2,[11] slightly greater than the standard gravity of 9.80665 m/s2. The value of standard gravity corresponds to the gravity on Earth at a radius of 6,375.4 kilometres (3,961.5\u00a0mi).[11]\n\n\n\n### Latitude[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The differences of Earth's gravity around the Antarctic continent.\nThe surface of the Earth is rotating, so it is not an inertial frame of reference. At latitudes nearer the Equator, the outward centrifugal force produced by Earth's rotation is larger than at polar latitudes. This counteracts the Earth's gravity to a small degree \u2013 up to a maximum of 0.3% at the Equator \u2013 and reduces the apparent downward acceleration of falling objects.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Earth's gravity measured by NASA GRACE mission, showing deviations from the theoretical gravity of an idealized, smooth Earth, the so-called Earth ellipsoid. Red shows the areas where gravity is stronger than the smooth, standard value, and blue reveals areas where gravity is weaker (**Animated version**).[1]\nThe **gravity of Earth**, denoted by **g**, is the net acceleration that is imparted to objects due to the combined effect of gravitation (from mass distribution within Earth) and the centrifugal force (from the Earth's rotation).[2][3]\nIt is a vector quantity, whose direction coincides with a plumb bob and strength or magnitude is given by the norm \n\n\n\ng\n=\n\u2016\n\n\n\ng\n\n\n\n\u2016\n\n\n{\\displaystyle g=\\|{\\mathit {\\mathbf {g} }}\\|}\n\n![{\\displaystyle g=\\|{\\mathit {\\mathbf {g} }}\\|}](image).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* The Earth is not homogeneous\n* The Earth is not a perfect sphere, and an average value must be used for its radius\n* This calculated value of *g* only includes true gravity. It does not include the reduction of constraint force that we perceive as a reduction of gravity due to the rotation of Earth, and some of gravity being counteracted by centrifugal force.\n\n\nThere are significant uncertainties in the values of *r* and *m*1 as used in this calculation, and the value of *G* is also rather difficult to measure precisely.\n\n\nIf *G*, *g* and *r* are known then a reverse calculation will give an estimate of the mass of the Earth. This method was used by Henry Cavendish.\n\n\n\n## Measurement[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Gravimetry\n\nThe measurement of Earth's gravity is called *gravimetry*.\n\n\n\n### Satellite measurements[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

It is weaker than Earth's gravity due to the planet's smaller mass. The average gravitational acceleration on Mars is 3.72076 ms\u22122 (about 38% of that of Earth) and it varies.[1] In general, topography-controlled isostasy drives the short wavelength free-air gravity anomalies.[2] At the same time, convective flow and finite strength of the mantle lead to long-wavelength planetary-scale free-air gravity anomalies over the entire planet.[3][4] Variation in crustal thickness, magmatic and volcanic activities, impact-induced Moho-uplift, seasonal variation of polar ice caps, atmospheric mass variation and variation of porosity of the crust could also correlate to the lateral variations.[5][6][7][8][9] Over the years models consisting of an increasing but limited number of spherical harmonics have been produced. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![{\\displaystyle m=0{\\text{ to }}4}](image) for the horizontal. For the Martian C20 and C30, they vary with time because of the seasonal variation of mass of the polar ice caps through the annual sublimation-condensation cycle of carbon dioxide.\nTo understand the gravity of Mars, its gravitational field strength *g* and gravitational potential *U* are often measured. Simply, if Mars is assumed to be a static perfectly spherical body of radius *RM*, provided that there is only one satellite revolving around Mars in a circular orbit and such gravitation interaction is the only force acting in the system, the equation would be\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nG\nM\nm\n\n\nr\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n=\nm\nr\n\n\u03c9\n\n2\n\n\n,\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\frac {GMm}{r^{2}}}=mr\\omega ^{2},}\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n20. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** Smith, D.

It lacks a definite surface, though it is likely to have a solid core.[36] Saturn's rotation causes it to have the shape of an oblate spheroid; that is, it is flattened at the poles and bulges at its equator. Its equatorial radius is more than 10% larger than its polar radius: 60,268\u00a0km versus 54,364\u00a0km.[6] Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune, the other giant planets in the Solar System, are also oblate but to a lesser extent. The combination of the bulge and rotation rate means that the effective surface gravity along the equator, 8.96\u00a0m/s2, is 74% of what it is at the poles and is lower than the surface gravity of Earth. However, the equatorial escape velocity of nearly 36\u00a0km/s is much higher than that of Earth.[37]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
