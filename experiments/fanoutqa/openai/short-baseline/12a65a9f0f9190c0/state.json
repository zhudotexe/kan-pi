Hispanic and Black populations overwhelmingly made up the vast majority of the Borough, but the Hispanic population was two times the size of the Black population. With the Hispanic making up a more than 50% majority in the borough, it is the largest concentration of Hispanic communities of NYC. Meanwhile, the other 3 boroughs like Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens had a more or less equal diverse racial and ethnic populations than The Bronx.
