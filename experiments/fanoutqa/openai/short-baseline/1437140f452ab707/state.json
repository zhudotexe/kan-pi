Registered Democrats hold a formidable 7-to-1 ratio over registered Republicans in Philadelphia, giving Democratic candidates a distinct advantage in citywide elections. The mayoral primary elections were held on May 19, 2015. Kenney won the primary in a landslide with 55.83% of the vote, defeating a crowded field of five other Democratic candidates, including Anthony H. Williams and former District Attorney Lynn Abraham. Republican Melissa Murray Bailey, a business executive, ran unopposed for the Republican nomination. Kenney won with 85.1% of the vote.[12] Kenney was inaugurated as the 99th Mayor of Philadelphia on January 4, 2016.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nMayors of Philadelphia (chronologically)\n |\n| --- |\n| Colonial era(1691\u20131776) | * Morrey\n* Shippen (I)\n* Morris (I)\n* G.

The only exemption being if the individual is being released following a first or second degree felony conviction and federal officials obtain a warrant from a judge[37][38] - effectively making Philadelphia a sanctuary city.[39][40] Nutter indicated that the change in policy supports public safety and will help rebuild the trust between police and the immigrant community.[38] The executive order was highlighted in June 2014 after a previously deported undocumented immigrant from Honduras was accused of raping a woman in Rittenhouse Square with the concern that if acquitted, the accused would not be submitted for deportation due to Philadelphia's new policy.[41][42][43]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of mayors of the largest 50 US cities\n* History of African Americans in Philadelphia\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNutter has supported the eviction of the Cradle of Liberty Council of the Boy Scouts of America from their headquarters on the Benjamin Franklin Parkway, both as a councilman and as mayor.

He was first elected to a term beginning on January 3, 2000, and was re-elected to a second term beginning in 2004. He is a Democrat and became mayor after having served 19 years in the Philadelphia City Council, including seven years as its president, before resigning as required under the Philadelphia City Charter in order to run for mayor. He followed Ed Rendell as mayor, assuming the post on January 3, 2000. Street was Philadelphia's second black mayor.\n\n\nStreet floated the possibility of being a candidate for statewide office in Pennsylvania. In light of corruption scandals, those prospects never materialized. *Time Magazine* listed him as one of the three worst big-city mayors in the United States in 2005.[4]\n\n\n\n\n## Biography and early career[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

He served from 1984 to 1992, a period which included the controversial MOVE police action and house bombing in 1985. Goode was also a community activist, chair of the state Public Utility Commission, and managing director for the City of Philadelphia.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPhiladelphia Mayor Bill Green, who had been elected in November 1979, had promised to appoint a black managing director after winning a racially divisive Democratic primary against former deputy mayor Charles Bowser. Green kept his promise by appointing Goode as managing director at the urging of key members of the black community. [*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Mayor of Philadelphia[edit]\n\n\nBefore the primary election of 1983, Green decided not to seek reelection. Goode jumped into the race and defeated former Mayor Frank Rizzo in a racially polarized primary election. Goode went on to win the general election over former Green fund-raiser and Philadelphia Stock Exchange Chairman John Egan, the Republican Party nominee.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Holst, Arthur Matthew (2013). \"Goode, W.
