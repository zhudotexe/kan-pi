The first two were marketed as the \"AFL\u2013NFL World Championship Game\", but were also casually referred to as \"the Super Bowl game\" during the television broadcast.[3] Super Bowl III in January 1969 was the first such game that carried the \"Super Bowl\" moniker in official marketing; the names \"Super Bowl I\" and \"Super Bowl II\" were retroactively applied to the first two games.[4]\n\n\nA total of 20 franchises, including teams that have relocated to another city or changed their name, have won the Super Bowl.[5] There are four NFL teams that have never appeared in a Super Bowl: the Cleveland Browns, Detroit Lions, Jacksonville Jaguars, and Houston Texans, though both the Browns (1950, 1954, 1955, 1964) and Lions (1935, 1952, 1953, 1957) had won NFL Championship Games prior to the creation of the Super Bowl in the 1966 season. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** The Broncos are the only NFL team with both consecutive wins and consecutive losses at the Super Bowl.\n2. **^** The New York Jets and Baltimore/Indianapolis Colts (Super Bowl III) is the only Super Bowl matchup that cannot be repeated under the current playoff alignment, as the Colts have since been placed in the AFC (at the time, along with all of the former AFL teams, including the Jets) as part of the AFL\u2013NFL merger in 1970. For the same reason, it is the only Super Bowl rematch that is capable of being played in the postseason outside of the Super Bowl.\n3. **^** The Dallas Cowboys and Buffalo Bills are the only NFL teams to face each other in consecutive Super Bowls, XXVII and XXVIII.\n4. **^** This is the only rematch pairing in which one team has relocated in the interim. The Rams represented St. Louis in Super Bowl XXXVI and Los Angeles in Super Bowl LIII.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* 3 times \u2013 Pittsburgh Steelers (X and XIII) vs. Dallas Cowboys (XXX) *see also Cowboys\u2013Steelers rivalry*\n* 2 times \u2013 Miami Dolphins (VII) vs. Washington Redskins (XVII)\n* 2 times \u2013 San Francisco 49ers (XVI and XXIII) vs. Cincinnati Bengals\n* 2 times \u2013 Dallas Cowboys (XXVII and XXVIII) vs. Buffalo Bills[n 3]\n* 2 times \u2013 New York Giants (XLII and XLVI) vs. New England Patriots *see also Giants\u2013Patriots rivalry*\n* 2 times \u2013 New England Patriots (XXXIX) vs. Philadelphia Eagles (LII)\n* 2 times \u2013 New England Patriots (XXXVI and LIII) vs. St. Louis/Los Angeles Rams[n 4]\n\n\n## Super Bowl records by team[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| NFLn/NFCN teams (29\u201328)\n | AFLa/AFCA teams (28\u201329)\n |\n| Pre-merger (0\u20131) as NFLn team\u00a0: Post-merger (2-1) as AFCA team[n 5] |\n\n\nIn the sortable table below, teams are ordered first by number of wins, followed by the number of appearances, and finally by the total number of points scored by the team throughout all appearances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n12. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** Hard Rock Stadium has also been variously known over the years as Joe Robbie Stadium, Pro Player Park, Pro Player Stadium, Dolphins Stadium (with a plural \"s\"), Dolphin Stadium (with no \"s\"), Land Shark Stadium, and Sun Life Stadium.\n13. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** Both Tempe and Glendale are suburbs of Phoenix, Arizona.[40][41]\n14. ^ ***a*** ***b*** NRG Stadium was originally known as Reliant Stadium.\n15. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** State Farm Stadium was originally known as University of Phoenix Stadium.\n16. **^** The East Rutherford, New Jersey, is a suburb of New York in Greater New York.\n17. **^** Unlike other Super Bowls, Super Bowl 50's official name, as designated by the NFL, uses the Arabic numeral \"50\" instead of the Roman numeral \"L\".\n18. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Dates for future Super Bowls are tentative pending possible changes to the NFL calendar.\n\n### Consecutive wins[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Buffalo Bills have the most consecutive appearances with four from 1990 to 1993. The Miami Dolphins (1971\u20131973) and New England Patriots (2016\u20132018) are the only other teams to have at least three consecutive appearances. All three teams with three or more consecutive Super Bowl appearances are in the AFC East division. Including those three, 11 teams have at least two consecutive appearances. The Dallas Cowboys are the only team with three separate streaks (1970\u20131971, 1977\u20131978, and 1992\u20131993). The Green Bay Packers, Pittsburgh Steelers, Denver Broncos,[n 1] and New England Patriots have each had two separate consecutive appearances. The Kansas City Chiefs are the most recent team to appear in consecutive Super Bowls playing in Super Bowl LIV and Super Bowl LV.
