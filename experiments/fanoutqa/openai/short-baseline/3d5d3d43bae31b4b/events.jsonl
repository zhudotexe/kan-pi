If no candidate receives a majority, a special run-off must be held between the two candidates with the highest number of votes. While the mayor's office is vacant pending a special election, the president of the city council serves as the interim mayor, with limited powers, until a new mayor is elected.[24] If for any reason a Mayor serves a partial term of two years or more, it will count as one full term.[18]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n21. **^** Garrick, David (November 21, 2018). \"Ballot measures hiking council pay, boosting transparency approved by wide margins in San Diego\". *The San Diego Union-Tribune*.

Instead, they recommended exploring future pay increases with additional condition that council members voting for pay increases not be allowed to benefit from the increase. This recommendation was approved by the city council in a 5–3 vote in favor of the changes.[19] In November 2018, voters passed Measure L which ties future mayoral salaries to those of Superior Court judges.[21] As of December 2020, the mayoral salary is $206,000.[22]\n\n\n\n## Election and succession[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_SrB2n6A8f5rXfgCoS3CGaLHh","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
