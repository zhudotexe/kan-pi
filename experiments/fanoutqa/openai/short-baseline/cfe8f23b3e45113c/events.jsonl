AlphaGo won all but the fourth game;[1] all games were won by resignation.[2] The match has been compared with the historic chess match between Deep Blue and Garry Kasparov in 1997.\n\n\nThe winner of the match was slated to win $1 million. Since AlphaGo won, Google DeepMind stated that the prize will be donated to charities, including UNICEF, and Go organisations.[3] Lee received $170,000 ($150,000 for participating in the five games and an additional $20,000 for winning one game).[4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAlphaGo (white) won the first game. Lee appeared to be in control throughout much of the match, but AlphaGo gained the advantage in the final 20 minutes and Lee resigned.[45] Lee stated afterwards that he had made a critical error at the beginning of the match; he said that the computer's strategy in the early part of the game was \"excellent\" and that the AI had made one unusual move that no human Go player would have made.[45] David Ormerod, commenting on the game at Go Game Guru, described Lee's seventh stone as \"a strange move to test AlphaGo's strength in the opening\", characterising the move as a mistake and AlphaGo's response as \"accurate and efficient\". \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAn Younggil at Go Game Guru concluded that the game was \"a masterpiece for Lee Sedol and will almost certainly become a famous game in the history of Go\".[57] Lee commented after the match that he considered AlphaGo was strongest when playing white (second).[61] For this reason, he requested that he play black in the fifth game, which is considered more risky.\n\n\nDavid Ormerod of Go Game Guru stated that although an analysis of AlphaGo's play around 79–87 was not yet available, he believed it was a result of a known weakness in play algorithms which use Monte Carlo tree search. In essence, the search attempts to prune sequences which are less relevant. In some cases, a play can lead to a very specific line of play which is significant, but which is overlooked when the tree is pruned, and this outcome is therefore \"off the search radar\".[62]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n56. **^** Byford, Sam (12 March 2016). \"AlphaGo beats Lee Se-dol again to take Google DeepMind Challenge series\". *The Verge*.

Lee stated afterwards that \"AlphaGo played a nearly perfect game\",[49] \"from very beginning of the game I did not feel like there was a point that I was leading\".[50] One of the creators of AlphaGo, Demis Hassabis, said that the system was confident of victory from the midway point of the game, even though the professional commentators could not tell which player was ahead.[50]\n\n\nMichael Redmond (9p) noted that AlphaGo's 19th stone (move 37) was \"creative\" and \"unique\". It was a move that no human would've ever made.[30] Lee took an unusually long time to respond to the move.[30] An Younggil (8p) called AlphaGo's move 37 \"a rare and intriguing shoulder hit\" but said Lee's counter was \"exquisite\". He stated that control passed between the players several times before the endgame, and especially praised AlphaGo's moves 151, 157, and 159, calling them \"brilliant\".[51]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLee, playing black, opened with a High Chinese formation and generated a large area of black influence, which AlphaGo invaded at move 12. This required the program to defend a weak group, which it did successfully.[54] An Younggil described Lee's move 31 as possibly the \"losing move\"[54] and Andy Jackson of the American Go Association considered that the outcome had already been decided by move 35.[53] AlphaGo had gained control of the game by move 48, and forced Lee onto the defensive. Lee counterattacked at moves 77/79, but AlphaGo's response was effective and its move 90 succeeded in simplifying the position. It then gained a large area of control at the bottom of the board, strengthening its position with moves from 102 to 112 described by An as \"sophisticated\".[54] Lee attacked again at moves 115 and 125, but AlphaGo's responses were again effective. Lee eventually attempted a complex *ko* from move 131, without forcing an error from the program, and he resigned at move 176.[54]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHe described AlphaGo's position as favourable in the first part of the game, considering that Lee started to come back with move 81, before making \"questionable\" moves at 119 and 123, followed by a \"losing\" move at 129.[46] Professional Go player Cho Hanseung commented that AlphaGo's game had greatly improved from when it beat Fan Hui in October 2015.[46] Michael Redmond described the computer's game as being more aggressive than against Fan.[47]\n\n\nAccording to 9-dan Go grandmaster Kim Seong-ryong, Lee seemed stunned by AlphaGo's strong play on the 102nd stone.[48] After watching AlphaGo make the game's 102nd move, Lee mulled over his options for more than 10 minutes.[48]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe first 11 moves were identical to the second game, where Lee also played white. In the early game, Lee concentrated on taking territory in the edges and corners of the board, allowing AlphaGo to gain influence in the top and centre. Lee then invaded AlphaGo's region of influence at the top with moves 40 to 48, following the *amashi* strategy. AlphaGo responded with a shoulder hit at move 47, subsequently sacrificing four stones elsewhere, and gaining the initiative with moves 47 to 53 and 69. Lee tested AlphaGo with moves 72 to 76 without provoking an error, and by this point in the game commentators had begun to feel Lee's play was a lost cause. However, an unexpected play at white 78, described as \"a brilliant *tesuji*\", turned the game around.[57] The move developed a white wedge at the centre, and increased the game's complexity.[58] Gu Li (9p) described it as a \"divine move\" and stated that the move had been completely unforeseen by him.[57]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n50. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Byford, Sam (10 March 2016). \"Google's DeepMind beats Lee Se-dol again to go 2-0 up in historic Go series\". *The Verge*.\n51. **^** Ormerod, David (10 March 2016). \"AlphaGo races ahead 2–0 against Lee Sedol\".
