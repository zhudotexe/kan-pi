Part of the 1967 NHL Expansion, the Flyers are the first of the expansion teams in the post–Original Six era to win the Stanley Cup, victorious in 1973–74 and again in 1974–75.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Quakers' dormant NHL franchise was finally canceled by the league in 1936.[10][11]\n\n\nIn 1946, a group led by Montreal and Philadelphia sportsman Len Peto announced plans to put another NHL team in Philadelphia, to build a $2.5 million rink to seat 20,000 where the Phillies' former ballpark stood at Broad and Huntingdon Streets, and to acquire the franchise of the old Montreal Maroons.[12] The latter was held by the Canadian Arena Company, owner of the Montreal Canadiens. However, Peto's group was unable to raise funding for the new arena project by the league-imposed deadline, and the NHL cancelled the Maroons franchise.[13][14][15]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWhile attending a basketball game on November 29, 1964, at the Boston Garden, Ed Snider, the then-vice-president of the Philadelphia Eagles, observed a crowd of Boston Bruins fans lining up to purchase tickets to see a last-place ice hockey team.[16] He began making plans for a new arena upon hearing the NHL was looking to expand due to fears of a competing league taking hold on the West Coast and the desire for a new television contract in the United States. Snider made his proposal to the league, which chose the Philadelphia group – including Snider, Bill Putnam, Jerome Schiff and Philadelphia Eagles owner Jerry Wolman – over the Baltimore group.\n\n\nOn April 4, 1966, Putnam announced that there was going to be a name-the-team contest.[17] Details of the contest were released on July 12.[17] The team name was announced on August 3.[17]\n\n\n\n### Early years (1967–1971)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPrior to 1967, Philadelphia had only iced a team in the NHL in the 1930–31 season, when the financially struggling Pittsburgh Pirates relocated in 1930 as the Philadelphia Quakers, playing at The Arena at 46th and Market Streets. The club, garbed in orange and black like today's Flyers, was coached by J. Cooper Smeaton, who was to be elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame 30 years later, for his far more notable role as an NHL referee. Among the young Quakers' skaters in 1930–31 was another future Hall of Famer in 19-year-old rookie center Syd Howe. The Quakers' only \"claim to fame\" was to establish a single season NHL record for futility which has stood ever since, by compiling a dismal record of 4–36–4, still the fewest games ever won in a season by an NHL club. The Quakers quietly suspended operations after that single dreadful campaign to again leave the Can-Am League's Philadelphia Arrows as Philadelphia's lone hockey team. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n![Pennsylvania](image) Sports teams based in Pennsylvania\n |\n| --- |\n| Australian Rules Football | USAFL\nPhiladelphia Hawks\n |\n| Baseball | MLB\nPhiladelphia Phillies\nPittsburgh Pirates\nIL\nLehigh Valley IronPigs\nScranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders\nEL\nAltoona Curve\nErie SeaWolves\nHarrisburg Senators\nReading Fightin Phils\nALPB\nLancaster Stormers\nYork Revolution\nMLBDL\nState College Spikes\nWilliamsport Crosscutters\nFL\nWashington Wild Things\nPL\nJohnstown Mill Rats\n |\n| Basketball | NBA\nPhiladelphia 76ers\n |\n| Cricket | * Lehigh Valley Cricket Club\n* Philadelphia Cricket Club\n |\n| Esports | OWL\nPhiladelphia Fusion\n |\n| Football | NFL\nPhiladelphia Eagles\nPittsburgh Steelers\nAFL\nPhiladelphia Soul\nGDFL\nErie Express\nWFA\nPhiladelphia Phantomz\nPittsburgh Passion\n |\n| Ice hockey | NHL\nPhiladelphia Flyers\nPittsburgh Penguins\nAHL\nHershey Bears\nLehigh Valley Phantoms\nWilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins\nECHL\nReading Royals\nOHL\nErie Otters\nNAHL\nJohnstown Tomahawks\nEHL\nPhiladelphia Little Flyers\nPhiladelphia Junior Flyers\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_l6CXDOS8RN0EvpGRE4SeHF5J","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

The Flyers compete in the National Hockey League (NHL) as a member of the Metropolitan Division in the Eastern Conference.[3] The team plays its home games in Wells Fargo Center in the South Philadelphia Sports Complex, an indoor arena they share with the Philadelphia 76ers of the National Basketball Association (NBA) and the Philadelphia Wings of the National Lacrosse League (NLL). Part of the 1967 NHL Expansion, the Flyers are the first of the expansion teams in the post–Original Six era to win the Stanley Cup, victorious in 1973–74 and again in 1974–75.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Quakers' dormant NHL franchise was finally canceled by the league in 1936.[10][11]\n\n\nIn 1946, a group led by Montreal and Philadelphia sportsman Len Peto announced plans to put another NHL team in Philadelphia, to build a $2.5 million rink to seat 20,000 where the Phillies' former ballpark stood at Broad and Huntingdon Streets, and to acquire the franchise of the old Montreal Maroons.[12] The latter was held by the Canadian Arena Company, owner of the Montreal Canadiens. However, Peto's group was unable to raise funding for the new arena project by the league-imposed deadline, and the NHL cancelled the Maroons franchise.[13][14][15]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWhile attending a basketball game on November 29, 1964, at the Boston Garden, Ed Snider, the then-vice-president of the Philadelphia Eagles, observed a crowd of Boston Bruins fans lining up to purchase tickets to see a last-place ice hockey team.[16] He began making plans for a new arena upon hearing the NHL was looking to expand due to fears of a competing league taking hold on the West Coast and the desire for a new television contract in the United States. Snider made his proposal to the league, which chose the Philadelphia group – including Snider, Bill Putnam, Jerome Schiff and Philadelphia Eagles owner Jerry Wolman – over the Baltimore group.\n\n\nOn April 4, 1966, Putnam announced that there was going to be a name-the-team contest.[17] Details of the contest were released on July 12.[17] The team name was announced on August 3.[17]\n\n\n\n### Early years (1967–1971)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPrior to 1967, Philadelphia had only iced a team in the NHL in the 1930–31 season, when the financially struggling Pittsburgh Pirates relocated in 1930 as the Philadelphia Quakers, playing at The Arena at 46th and Market Streets. The club, garbed in orange and black like today's Flyers, was coached by J. Cooper Smeaton, who was to be elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame 30 years later, for his far more notable role as an NHL referee. Among the young Quakers' skaters in 1930–31 was another future Hall of Famer in 19-year-old rookie center Syd Howe. The Quakers' only \"claim to fame\" was to establish a single season NHL record for futility which has stood ever since, by compiling a dismal record of 4–36–4, still the fewest games ever won in a season by an NHL club. The Quakers quietly suspended operations after that single dreadful campaign to again leave the Can-Am League's Philadelphia Arrows as Philadelphia's lone hockey team. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n![Pennsylvania](image) Sports teams based in Pennsylvania\n |\n| --- |\n| Australian Rules Football | USAFL\nPhiladelphia Hawks\n |\n| Baseball | MLB\nPhiladelphia Phillies\nPittsburgh Pirates\nIL\nLehigh Valley IronPigs\nScranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders\nEL\nAltoona Curve\nErie SeaWolves\nHarrisburg Senators\nReading Fightin Phils\nALPB\nLancaster Stormers\nYork Revolution\nMLBDL\nState College Spikes\nWilliamsport Crosscutters\nFL\nWashington Wild Things\nPL\nJohnstown Mill Rats\n |\n| Basketball | NBA\nPhiladelphia 76ers\n |\n| Cricket | * Lehigh Valley Cricket Club\n* Philadelphia Cricket Club\n |\n| Esports | OWL\nPhiladelphia Fusion\n |\n| Football | NFL\nPhiladelphia Eagles\nPittsburgh Steelers\nAFL\nPhiladelphia Soul\nGDFL\nErie Express\nWFA\nPhiladelphia Phantomz\nPittsburgh Passion\n |\n| Ice hockey | NHL\nPhiladelphia Flyers\nPittsburgh Penguins\nAHL\nHershey Bears\nLehigh Valley Phantoms\nWilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins\nECHL\nReading Royals\nOHL\nErie Otters\nNAHL\nJohnstown Tomahawks\nEHL\nPhiladelphia Little Flyers\nPhiladelphia Junior Flyers\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_l6CXDOS8RN0EvpGRE4SeHF5J","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
