The club won six trophies in a calendar year in 2009, becoming one of only 2 male football teams in the world to win the coveted sextuple, apart from FC Bayern Munich in 2020. FC Barcelona also has professional teams in other sports like FC Barcelona Regal (basketball), FC Barcelona Handbol (handball), FC Barcelona Hoquei (roller hockey), FC Barcelona Ice Hockey (ice hockey), FC Barcelona Futsal (futsal) and FC Barcelona Rugby (rugby union), all at one point winners of the highest national and/or European competitions.

It is the capital and largest city of the autonomous community of Catalonia, as well as the second-most populous municipality of Spain. With a population of 1.6 million within city limits,[7] its urban area extends to numerous neighbouring municipalities within the province of Barcelona and is home to around 4.8 million people,[3] making it the fifth most populous urban area in the European Union after Paris, the Ruhr area, Madrid and Milan.[3] It is one of the largest metropolises on the Mediterranean Sea, located on the coast between the mouths of the rivers Llobregat and Bes\u00f2s, bounded to the west by the Serra de Collserola mountain range.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe development of Barcelona was promoted by two events in 1986: Spanish accession to the European Community, and particularly Barcelona's designation as host city of the 1992 Summer Olympics.[57][58] The process of urban regeneration has been rapid, and accompanied by a greatly increased international reputation of the city as a tourist destination. The increased cost of housing has led to a slight decline (\u221216.6%) in the population over the last two decades of the 20th century as many families move out into the suburbs. This decline has been reversed since 2001, as a new wave of immigration (particularly from Latin America and from Morocco) has gathered pace.[59]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

The 80,000-seat Stade de France, built for the 1998 FIFA World Cup, is located just north of Paris in the commune of Saint-Denis.[272] It is used for football, rugby union and track and field athletics. It hosts the France national football team for friendlies and major tournaments qualifiers, annually hosts the French national rugby team's home matches of the Six Nations Championship, and hosts several important matches of the Stade Fran\u00e7ais rugby team.[272] In addition to Paris Saint-Germain F.C., the city has a number of other professional and amateur football clubs: Paris FC, Red Star, RCF Paris and Stade Fran\u00e7ais Paris.\n\n\nParis hosted the 1900 and 1924 Summer Olympics and will host the 2024 Summer Olympics and Paralympic Games.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nCities in France by population\n |\n| --- |\n| 2,000,000+ | * Paris\n |\n| 500,000+ | * Marseille\n* Lyon\n* Toulouse\n |\n| 200,000+ | * Nice\n* Nantes\n* Montpellier\n* Strasbourg\n* Bordeaux\n* Lille\n* Rennes\n |\n| 100,000+ | * Toulon\n* Reims\n* Saint-\u00c9tienne\n* Le Havre\n* Dijon\n* Grenoble\n* Angers\n* Villeurbanne\n* Saint-Denis, R\u00e9union\n* N\u00eemes\n* Aix-en-Provence\n* Clermont-Ferrand\n* Le Mans\n* Brest\n* Tours\n* Amiens\n* Annecy\n* Limoges\n* Metz\n* Boulogne-Billancourt\n* Perpignan\n* Besan\u00e7on\n* Orl\u00e9ans\n* Rouen\n* Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis\n* Montreuil\n* Caen\n* Argenteuil\n* Mulhouse\n* Saint-Paul\n* Nancy\n |\n| * Complete list\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe city also hosted the finals of the 1938 FIFA World Cup (at the Stade Olympique de Colombes), as well as the 1998 FIFA World Cup and the 2007 Rugby World Cup Final (both at the Stade de France).

Eurostat places Paris (6.5 million people) behind London (8 million) and ahead of Berlin (3.5 million), based on the 2012 populations of what Eurostat calls \"urban audit core cities\".[157]\nThe population of Paris today is lower than its historical peak of 2.9 million in 1921.[158] The principal reasons were a significant decline in household size, and a dramatic migration of residents to the suburbs between 1962 and 1975. Factors in the migration included de-industrialisation, high rent, the gentrification of many inner quarters, the transformation of living space into offices, and greater affluence among working families. The city's population loss came to a temporary halt at the beginning of the 21st century; the population increased from 2,125,246 in 1999 to 2,240,621 in 2012, before declining again slightly in 2017, 2018, and again in 2021.[159][160]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"R\u00e9pertoire national des \u00e9lus: les maires\" (in French). data.gouv.fr, Plateforme ouverte des donn\u00e9es publiques fran\u00e7aises. 16 December 2022.
