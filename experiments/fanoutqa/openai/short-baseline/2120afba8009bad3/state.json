It is produced by Lucasfilm Ltd. and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. The trilogy consists of episodes *VII* through *IX*, chronologically following the prequel trilogy (*Episodes I*\u2013*III*; 1999\u20132005) and the original trilogy (*Episodes IV*\u2013*VI*; 1977\u20131983), serving as the final act of the \"Skywalker saga\". Lucas had planned a sequel trilogy as early as 1976, but canceled it by 1981. He produced only the first six episodes, and for a time described these as comprising the complete story. The sequel trilogy concept was revived when the Walt Disney Company entered negotiations to acquire Lucasfilm in 2011. Lucas produced new story treatments, but these were largely discarded. Both the acquisition and plans to produce the trilogy were announced in late 2012.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs part of his biographical research on George Lucas in the early 1980s, Lucas allowed author Dale Pollock to read the plot outlines of a 12-film saga on the condition of signing a confidentiality agreement.[10] Pollock said these sequel trilogy drafts would \"involve Luke Skywalker in his 30s and 40s\" and that they would be \"The three most exciting stories ... They had propulsive action, really interesting new worlds, new characters.\"[10] Lucas's plans were drastically changed after *The Empire Strikes Back* was released, owing to the stress of producing the first three films as well as pressure from his wife, Marcia, to step back from this kind of filmmaking. By 1981, Lucas had decided to make only one *Star Wars* trilogy.[11]\n\n\n\n### Cancellation period[edit]\n\n\nAccording to Gary Kurtz, details of elements from the discarded sequel trilogy which were incorporated into *Return of the Jedi* include:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n120. **^** McNary, Dave (April 17, 2013). \"Star Wars Movies Coming in 2015, 2017 and 2019\". *Variety*.

Rey learns the ways of the Force under Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa, and confronts Kylo Ren\u2014the son of Leia and Han Solo, nephew of Luke, and grandson of Anakin Skywalker\u2014who has fallen to the dark side. The first two films received positive reviews from critics, while the third received mixed reviews. The trilogy grossed over $4.4\u00a0billion at the box office worldwide, with each film surpassing $1 billion worldwide.\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\n### Early development[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRey's journey mirrors that of Anakin and Luke in the prequel and original trilogies.[210] The final scene of *The Last Jedi* depicts servant children playing with a toy of Luke, with one boy using the Force to grab a broom. According to *Inverse*, this symbolizes that \"the Force can be found in people with humble beginnings.\"[211] A writer for the same website interprets the end of *The Rise of Skywalker* as seeing Rey \"bury the past\" and rejecting \"any power her grandfather held over her\" in a completion of the hero's journey.[212]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Box office performance[edit]\n\n\nUnlike the previous trilogies, the sequel trilogy experienced diminishing box office returns with each succeeding film. Nevertheless, it is the highest-grossing trilogy overall, with *The Force Awakens* ranking as the fourth-highest-grossing film of all time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe film broke opening weekend box office records in North America with $248\u00a0million ($39\u00a0million more than previous record holder *Jurassic World*) and totals of $529\u00a0million worldwide, the largest opening ever. The film set another new record by becoming the first movie to break the $1\u00a0billion mark in box office sales in just 12 days.[123] It is currently the highest-grossing film of all time in North America and the fourth highest-grossing film worldwide, unadjusted for inflation.[124]\n\n\n\n### *Star Wars: The Last Jedi*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Star Wars: The Last Jedi\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nThe main cast of the sequel trilogy is played by Adam Driver (Kylo Ren), Daisy Ridley (Rey), John Boyega (Finn), and Oscar Isaac (Poe Dameron), respectively.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n214. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Reid, Caroline. \"'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' Becomes The Most Expensive Movie Ever Made\". *Forbes*.
