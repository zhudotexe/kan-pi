As a result, the length measurements of many rivers are only approximations (see also coastline paradox). In particular, there seems to exist disagreement as to whether the Nile[3] or the Amazon[4] is the world's longest river. The Nile has traditionally been considered longer, but in 2007 and 2008 some scientists claimed that the Amazon is longer[5][6][7] by measuring the river plus the adjacent Par\u00e1 estuary and the longest connecting tidal canal.[8] A peer-reviewed article published 2009 in the *International Journal of Digital Earth* concludes that the Nile is longer.[9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

In addition, it is the second longest river, measuring 6,575\u00a0km (4,086\u00a0mi)[3] from its source to the mouth of the Atlantic Ocean[4] after the Nile River which is considered to be the longest river in the world (see Source of the Nile River), although there is some dispute. About halfway through its length, upstream from the city of Iquitos, Peru, the Amazon divides into the Mara\u00f1\u00f3n and Ucayali Rivers. Both of these rivers have been considered the main sources of the Amazon so far. The Mara\u00f1\u00f3n has the higher flow rate, while the Ucayali is longer. In the Ucayali basin are the two farthest sources of the Amazon, the Apur\u00edmac and Mantaro Rivers.[5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Gupta, Avijit (2007). *Large rivers: geomorphology and management*.

However, this criterion is not easy to employ in the case of most of the world's largest rivers. Depending on which definition or interpretation is preferred, there can certainly be a couple of different answers for the source of a given river.\nThus, a number of headstream areas of the Amazon River should be considered: \n\n\n\n1. the Mara\u00f1on River (the Lauricocha and Nupe Rivers) in a historical context;\n2. the Mantaro River with the most distant but semi-permanent spring;\n3. the Apur\u00edmac River (the Carhuasanta River) with the most distant source of uninterrupted flow.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2014, James Contos and Nicholas Tripcevich came up with a finding that the most distant source of the Amazon is called the Mantaro River. They located the most distant spring in the headwaters of Lake Junin in the Rumi Cruz mountains 10\u00b043\u203255\u2033S 76\u00b038\u203253\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff10.732\u00b0S 76.648\u00b0W\ufeff / -10.732; -76.648, at an elevation of 5,220 metres (17,130\u00a0ft). Contos and Tripcevich calculated and compared the length of the Apur\u00edmac 734.3 kilometres (456.3\u00a0mi) and Mantaro Rivers 809 kilometres (503\u00a0mi) and found that the Mantaro River is about 75 kilometres (47\u00a0mi) longer. Nevertheless, Contos and Tripcevich acknowledge that the flow of the Mantaro River source is interrupted several months a year and thus a drop of water at its source may not complete the journey to the mouth of the Amazon.[26]\n\n\n\n## Headstream areas of the Amazon River[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Mara\u00f1\u00f3n, Mantaro and Apur\u00edmac Rivers originate in the high mountain area of the Peruvian Andes at altitudes over 5,000 metres (16,000\u00a0ft). All three sources are considered to be the source of the Amazon, but from different points of view. The Mara\u00f1\u00f3n can be considered as the main source of the Amazon based on its discharge, but the Ucayali and its tributaries are longer\u20142,738 kilometres (1,701\u00a0mi) compared to 1,415 kilometres (879\u00a0mi) of the Mara\u00f1\u00f3n.[6][7] The main source of the Amazon River is therefore difficult to determine, so it is correct to talk about several of its source areas.\n\n\n\n## The Mara\u00f1\u00f3n River headwaters[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHeadwaters of the Amazon River\n\n![](image)Map of the Amazon River\nThe main source of the largest river in the world[nb 1] has been a subject of exploring and speculations for centuries and continues to cause arguments even today. Determining the origin of the Amazon River has evoked broad debates among scholars, explorers, and travelers all over the world. Different definitions of a river's source have been used and continue to be used. Generally, four main criteria can be applied to determine the main source of a river: source flow rate, source length, watershed area of the source, and an altitude of its spring.[2] At present, the Amazon River is not considered to have one unique source but a number of headstream areas. These are headwaters of three different Peruvian rivers that can be found in the high Andes: the Mara\u00f1\u00f3n, the Apur\u00edmac, and the Mantaro.\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Bohum\u00edr Jansk\u00fd (Czech-Peruvian expedition Hatun Mayu 2000) | 2000 | Nevado Mismi - headwaters territory with sources of Carhuasanta, Ccaccansa, Apacheta and Sillanque\n |\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The Amazon is the largest river in the world by discharge.[1]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFritz's claim about the main source of the Amazon River was unchallenged for nearly 200 years. In the late 19th century, an Italian-born Peruvian geographer and scientist Antonio Raimondi proposed that the Nupe River, which he said was a longer and more voluminous river than the Lauricocha River, is the main head stream.[11][12] The Nupe River has its origin in a system of small lakes near one of the highest peaks of the Huayhuash Range called Siula Grande. The uppermost lake 4,351 metres (14,275\u00a0ft) is called Quesillococha (10\u00b016\u203255\u2033S 76\u00b052\u203208\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff10.282\u00b0S 76.869\u00b0W\ufeff / -10.282; -76.869).[13]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n18. **^** Google Earth\n19. **^** MacIntyre, Loren (Oct 1972), \"Amazon: The River Sea,\" *National Geographic Magazine.*\n20. **^** Google Earth\n21. **^** Jansk\u00fd, B. et al.
