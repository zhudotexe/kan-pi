Prompted by rapid development and urbanisation, Jakarta attracted large numbers of new settlers from all over the archipelago, with the majority coming from rural Javanese towns. High-rise buildings sprung up, especially in Jakarta's commercial and financial centres along Thamrin, Sudirman, and Kuningan avenues. As a result, since the 1970s, the population of Jakarta has spiked tremendously and spilled into areas surrounding the capital. The Jabodetabek, or Greater Jakarta, region has become the largest and the most densely populated urban agglomeration in Southeast Asia.\n\n\n\n## New capital proposals throughout the decades[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe **capital of the Republic of Indonesia** is Jakarta,[1] one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in Southeast Asia. Previously known as Batavia, it was the *de facto* capital of the Dutch East Indies. In the early 20th century, the Dutch East Indies government attempted to relocate the capital from Batavia to Bandung.[2] During Indonesia's struggle for independence, the Indonesian government moved the capital to Yogyakarta and then to Bukittinggi, where it remained for a short time until the restoration of control to Jakarta.[3] In 2019, during his annual state of the union address at the parliament, President Joko Widodo announced a plan to relocate the capital to Kalimantan on the island of Borneo.[4] As part of the plan, part of Kutai Kartanegara Regency and Penajam North Paser Regency in East Kalimantan will be carved out to create a new province-level planned city, and the capital will be relocated to a more central location within Indonesia. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNational capital in Indonesia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_f9DMwmEtdS56e3APUi9QglRB","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

High-rise buildings sprung up, especially in Jakarta's commercial and financial centres along Thamrin, Sudirman, and Kuningan avenues. As a result, since the 1970s, the population of Jakarta has spiked tremendously and spilled into areas surrounding the capital.

The city is renowned for its opulent palaces, temples, parks, gardens, tombs, walls and gates.[19] Beijing is one of the most important tourist destinations of the world. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* ![](image)Definitions from Wiktionary\n* ![](image)Media from Commons\n* ![](image)News from Wikinews\n* ![](image)Quotations from Wikiquote\n* ![](image)Texts from Wikisource\n* ![](image)Textbooks from Wikibooks\n* ![](image)Resources from Wikiversity\n* ![](image)Travel information from Wikivoyage\n\n* Economic profile for Beijing at HKTDC\n* Visit Beijing – official Facebook page\n* Photograph of *The approach to Peking – outside the walls* taken in 1890 by Sir Henry Norman\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Preceded byLin'an (Song dynasty)\n |  **Capital of China (as Dadu of Yuan)** 1264–1368\n | Succeeded byNanjing (Ming dynasty)\n |\n| Preceded byNanjing (Ming dynasty)\n |  **Capital of China** 1420–1928\n | Succeeded byNanjing (ROC)\n |\n| Preceded byNanjing (ROC)\n |  **Capital of the People's Republic of China** 1949–present\n | Succeeded bypresent capital\n |\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nBeijing\n |\n| --- |\n| * History\n* Politics\n* Geography\n* Toponym\n |\n| Administration | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Direct-administered municipalities | * Beijing\n* Tianjin\n* Shanghai\n* Chongqing\n |\n| Special administrative regions | * Hong Kong\n* Macau\n |\n\n |\n| *See also:* *List of prefectures in China*, *List of cities in China*\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nMetropolitan cities of China\n |\n| --- |\n| \n\n| Major metropolitan regions\n |\n| --- |\n| \n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * Jing-Jin-Ji (BJ-TJ-HE)\n* Greater Bay Area\n* Yangtze Delta (SH-JS-ZJ)\n* Zhongyuan\n* Chengyu\n* Cross-Strait Western Coast\n* Guanzhong\n* Mid-Southern Liaoning\n* Shandong Peninsula\n* Yangtze River Midstream (Yangtze River Valley)\n |\n\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n| Major cities\n |\n| --- |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs of 2021, Beijing was ranked first globally in terms of \"*Global City Competitiveness*\" in the *2020–2021 Global Urban Competitiveness Report* jointly released by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) and the United Nations Programme for Human Settlements (UN-Habitat).[137]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_3KFSKAXggRBdfhFVplpuVGFA","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
