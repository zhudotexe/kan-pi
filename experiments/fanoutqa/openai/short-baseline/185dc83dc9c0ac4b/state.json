The following is a list of the ten largest institutions of higher education by Fall 2020 enrollment, meaning it is the number of unique individuals who were enrolled in at least one class on the 21st day of the Fall 2020 semester. Whether a system of individual campuses is counted as one or multiple institutions depends on how that institution is accredited and chartered. All data can be verified on the IPEDS system website.[1]\n\n\n\n### 2020[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| U.S. Department of Education Fall 2020 Enrollment[2] |\n| --- |\n| **Rank** | **Classification** | **Location** | **Enrollment** |\n| 1 | Western Governors University | Private | Online | 147,866\n |\n| 2 | Southern New Hampshire University | Private, Non-profit | New Hampshire | 134,345\n |\n| 3 | Grand Canyon University | Private, For-profit | Arizona | 103,427\n |\n| 4 | Liberty University | Private | Virginia | 93,349\n |\n| 5 | The Pennsylvania State University | Public | Pennsylvania | 89,816\n |\n| 6 | University of Phoenix-Arizona | Private, For-profit | Arizona | 89,763\n |\n| 7 | Arizona State University Campus Immersion | Public research university | Arizona | 74,795\n |\n| 8 | Dallas College | TBC | Texas | 74,781\n |\n| 9 | University of Central Florida | Public | Florida | 71,881\n |\n| 10 | Texas A & M University-College Station | Public | Texas | 70,418\n |\n\n\n### 2013[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| U.S. Department of Education Fall 2013 Enrollment[3] |\n| --- |\n| **Rank** | **College** | **Classification** | **Location** | **Enrollment** |\n| 1 | State University of New York System | Public | New York | 606,232\n |\n| 2 | California State University | Public | California | 477,466[4] |\n| 3 | University of Phoenix | Private, For-profit | Arizona | 442,033\n |\n| 4 | University of California | Public | California | 226,449[5] |\n| 5 | University of North Carolina System | Public\n | North Carolina | 222,322\n |\n| 6 | Ivy Tech Community College | Public | Indiana | 175,313\n |\n| 7 | Ashford University | Private, For-profit | Iowa | 169,843\n |\n| 8 | American Public University System | Private, For-profit | West Virginia | 110,644\n |\n| 9 | Liberty University | Private | Virginia | 110,000\n |\n| 10 | Miami Dade College | Public | Florida | 100,855\n |\n| 11 | Lone Star College System | Public | Texas | 98,313\n |\n| 12 | The Pennsylvania State University | Public | Pennsylvania | 94,441\n |\n| 13 | Houston Community College System | Public | Texas | 93,625\n |\n| 14 | Arizona State University | Public | Arizona | 81,789\n |\n| 15 | Kaplan University | Private, For-profit | Iowa | 77,566\n |\n| 16 | Northern Virginia Community College | Public | Virginia | 76,552\n |\n| 17 | Walden University | Private, For-profit | Minnesota | 75,895\n |\n| 18 | Tarrant County College District | Public | Texas | 75,547\n |\n| 19 | Wake Technical Community College | Public | North Carolina | 74,000[6] |\n| 20 | Grand Canyon University | Private[Note 1] | Arizona | 71,712\n |\n| 21 | Austin Community College District | Public | Texas | 70,452\n |\n| 22 | University of Central Florida | Public | Florida | 69,086\n |\n| 23 | Ohio State University | Public | Ohio | 64,930\n |\n| 24 | University of Maryland | Public | Maryland | 64,737\n |\n| 25 | University of Minnesota | Public | Minnesota | 63,929\n |\n| 26 | Broward College | Public | Florida | 62,796\n |\n| 27 | Florida International University | Public | Florida | 60,592\n |\n| 28 | Valencia College | Public | Florida | 60,469\n |\n| 29 | University of Florida | Public | Florida | 56,683\n |\n| 30 | East Los Angeles College | Public | California | 56,395\n |\n| 31 | College of Southern Nevada | Public | Nevada | 56,364\n |\n| 32 | Rio Salado College | Public | Arizona | 56,031\n |\n| 33 | Capella University | Private, For-profit | Minnesota | 56,009\n |\n| 34 | Portland Community College | Public | Oregon | 55,558\n |\n\n\n1. **^** As of July 1, 2018, Grand Canyon University has transitioned from for-profit to nonprofit.\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* World's largest universities\n* List of largest universities by enrollment\n* List of largest United States university campuses by enrollment\n* List of largest United States universities by undergraduate enrollment\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** IPEDS Datacenter United States Department of Education.\n2. **^** IPEDS Datacenter\n3. **^** IPEDS Datacenter\n4. **^** \"Enrollment | CSU\".\n5. **^** \"University of California | 1: Undergraduate Admissions and Enrollment\".\n6. **^** \"About Wake Tech\". 21 December 2021.\n\n## External links[edit]\n\n\n* Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System, U.S. Department of Education.
