They became the second team in NBA history to reach the NBA Finals in five consecutive seasons. The Warriors faced off against the Toronto Raptors and they lost to them in six games.\n\n\nUpon injuries to backcourt duo Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson as well as Durant's sign-and-trade departure to the Brooklyn Nets, the Warriors struggled for the next two years, failing to qualify for the playoffs in either season. The team would return to familiar success after defeating the Boston Celtics in 6 games in the 2022 NBA Finals. Curry would win NBA Finals MVP, winning his fourth championship and popularly cementing his role as the face of the franchise's dynastic era. The following 2022 season would see difficulties in balancing veteran leadership and youthful development, producing criticisms from analysts and opponents in the Warriors' ability to continue their dominance.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nNBA season-by-season team history\n |\n| --- |\n| EasternConference | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Atlantic | * Boston Celtics\n* Brooklyn Nets\n* New York Knicks\n* Philadelphia 76ers\n* Toronto Raptors\n |\n| Central | * Chicago Bulls\n* Cleveland Cavaliers\n* Detroit Pistons\n* Indiana Pacers\n* Milwaukee Bucks\n |\n| Southeast | * Atlanta Hawks\n* Charlotte Hornets\n* Miami Heat\n* Orlando Magic\n* Washington Wizards\n |\n\n |\n| WesternConference | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Northwest | * Denver Nuggets\n* Minnesota Timberwolves\n* Oklahoma City Thunder\n* Portland Trail Blazers\n* Utah Jazz\n |\n| Pacific | * Golden State Warriors\n* Los Angeles Clippers\n* Los Angeles Lakers\n* Phoenix Suns\n* Sacramento Kings\n |\n| Southwest | * Dallas Mavericks\n* Houston Rockets\n* Memphis Grizzlies\n* New Orleans Pelicans\n* San Antonio Spurs\n |\n\n |\n| Defunctfranchises | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nLed by NBA Most Valuable Player Stephen Curry, the Warriors defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers in six games to win the 2015 NBA championship series.

The team reached its first NBA Finals in 21 seasons in 1994, losing to the Houston Rockets in seven games. Five years later, New York again lost in the NBA Finals, this time in a five-game series against the San Antonio Spurs. The Knicks struggled during the early years of the 21st century, winning only one playoff series between 2001 and 2022.

With the acquisition of Kevin Garnett for 2007\u201308, the Celtics achieved a record single-season rise in win percentage to claim their first title in twenty-two seasons, in the process achieving the best average point differential between the 1995\u201396 Bulls and the 2015\u201316 Warriors.[1] The team remained a power until after the 2011 lockout, but lost to the Warriors in their most recent Finals appearance.\n\n\nThe Celtics are 27\u20139 all-time in seventh games of playoff series,[2] and 7\u20131 in Game 7 of the NBA Finals.\n\n\n\n## Seasons[edit]\n\n\n*Note: Statistics are correct as of the 2022\u201323\u00a0season.*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWith seventeen NBA Championships, the Celtics are tied with the Los Angeles Lakers for the most amongst all NBA franchises, while the 1959-to-1966 domination of the NBA Championship, with eight straight titles, is the longest consecutive championship winning streak of any major professional sport team to date. Following this, the Celtics had two major periods of success separated by quite poor seasons during rebuilding.
