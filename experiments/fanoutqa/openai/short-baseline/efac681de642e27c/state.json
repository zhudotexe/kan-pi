The spoken languages of the region are largely based on geography and shared across religious boundaries, but the written script is sharply divided by religious boundaries. In particular, Muslims of South Asia such as in Afghanistan and Pakistan use the Arabic alphabet and Persian Nastaliq. Till 1952, Muslim-majority Bangladesh (then known as East Pakistan) also mandated only the Nastaliq script, but after that adopted regional scripts and particularly Bengali, after the Language Movement for the adoption of Bengali as the official language of the then East Pakistan. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Places adjacent to South Asia\n |\n| --- |\n| |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Central AsiaWest Asia | Central Asia, East Asia | East Asia |\n|  | ![](image) |  |\n| West Asia | ![](image)**South Asia**![](image)\n | Southeast Asia |\n|  | ![](image) |  |\n| Arabian Sea | Indian Ocean | Bay of BengalIndian Ocean |\n |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nSouth Asian topics\n |\n| --- |\n| Countries and regions | * Afghanistan\n* Bangladesh\n* Bhutan\n* India\n\t+ North\n\t\t- Northwest\n\t+ South\n\t+ Northeast\n\t+ Islands\n* Maldives\n* Nepal\n* Pakistan\n\t+ Punjab\n* Sri Lanka\n* South Asian regions\n\t+ Northwestern\n\t+ Northern\n\t+ Eastern\n\t+ Southern\n* General geography\n | ![](image)\n |\n| Ethnic groups | * Andamanese\n* Austroasiatic\n* Austronesian\n* Dravidian\n* Indo-Aryan\n* Iranic\n* Nuristani\n* Tibeto-Burman\n* Turkic\n* Other groups\n\t+ Afro-Asians\n\t+ Chinese\n\t+ European and Eurasian\n\t+ Semitic\n* Diaspora\n |\n| Culture | * Architecture\u200e\n* Art\n* Cinema\n* Cuisine\n* Cultural sphere\n* Fashion\n* Languages\n* Literature\n* Music\n* Mythology\n* Philosophy\n* Scripts\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Country\n | Capital\n | Form of government\n | Head of state\n | Head of government\n | Legislature\n | Official language\n | Currency\n | Coat of arms / National Emblems\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Afghanistan | Kabul | Unitary totalitarian provisional theocratic Islamic emirate | Supreme Leader | Prime Minister | Leadership\u00a0Council[277] | PashtoDari | **\u060b** Afghani | ![](image) |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Bangladesh | Dhaka | Unitary parliamentary constitutional republic | President | Prime Minister | Jatiya Sangsad | BengaliEnglish | **\u09f3** Taka | ![](image) |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Bhutan | Thimphu | Unitary parliamentary constitutional monarchy | King | Prime Minister | National CouncilNational Assembly | Dzongkha | **Nu.** Ngultrum | ![](image) |\n| ![](image)\u00a0India | New Delhi | Federal parliamentary constitutional republic\n | President | Prime Minister | Rajya SabhaLok Sabha | HindiEnglish | **\u20b9** Indian rupee | ![](image) |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAccording to Robert M. Cutler \u2013 a scholar of political science at Carleton University,[63] the terms South Asia, Southwest Asia, and Central Asia are distinct, but the confusion and disagreements have arisen due to the geopolitical movement to enlarge these regions into Greater South Asia, Greater Southwest Asia, and Greater Central Asia. The frontier of Greater South Asia, states Cutler, between 2001 and 2006 has been geopolitically extended to eastern Iran and western Afghanistan in the west, and in the north to northeastern Iran, northern Afghanistan, and southern Uzbekistan.[63]\n\n\nIdentification with a South Asian identity was found to be significantly low among respondents in an older two-year survey across Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka.[64]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nFor a topical guide, see Outline of South Asian history.

The current territories of Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan which were the core territories of the British Empire from 1857 to 1947 also form the core territories of South Asia.[25][26] The mountain countries of Nepal and Bhutan, two independent countries that were not under the British Raj but were protectorates of the Empire,[27] and the island countries of Sri Lanka and Maldives are generally included. By various definitions based on substantially different reasons, the British Indian Ocean Territory and the Tibet Autonomous Region may be included as well.[28][29][30][31][32][33][34] Myanmar (Burma), a former British colony and now largely considered a part of Southeast Asia, is also sometimes included.[18][20][35] Afghanistan is also included by some sources.[18][20][36][37]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

States with multiple national languages may offer several versions of their anthem. For instance, Switzerland's national anthem has different lyrics for each of the country's four official languages: French, German, Italian, and Romansh.[11] One of New Zealand's two national anthems is commonly sung with the first verse in M\u0101ori (\"Aotearoa\") and the second in English (\"God Defend New Zealand\"). The tune is the same but the lyrics have different meanings. South Africa's national anthem is unique in that it is two different songs put together with five of the country's eleven official languages being used, in which each language comprises a stanza.[12]\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n* A\n* B\n* C\n* D\n* E\n* F\n* G\n* H\n* I\n* J\n* K\n* L\n* M\n* N\n* O\n* P\n* Q\n* R\n* S\n* T\n* U\n* V\n* W\n* X\n* Y\n* Z\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* Anthems of partially recognized states and territories\n* See also\n* References\n* Notes\n* Further reading\n* External links\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n20. **^** Thailand's royal anthem is \"Phleng Sansoen Phra Barami\".\n21. **^** Royal anthem in a number of Commonwealth realms, including the United Kingdom, but no official status as national anthem.\n22. **^** Anthems of the Countries of the United Kingdom (England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland), sometimes described as \"national anthems\", are not listed here.
