Its per capita GDP was CN\u00a596,474 (US$14,343 in nominal), ranking 8th among all the 31 provincial divisions of China.[5] The primary, secondary and tertiary industries contributed \u00a5265 billion ($39.45 billion), \u00a51.12 trillion ($167.1 billion) and \u00a5926 billion ($137.7 billion) to the GDP respectively.[5]\n\n\nIn addition to its large reserves of natural resources, Inner Mongolia also has the largest usable wind power capacity in China[47] thanks to strong winds which develop in the province's grasslands. Some private companies have set up wind parks in parts of Inner Mongolia such as Bailingmiao, Hutengliang and Zhouzi.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Government Chairwoman | Wang Lixia |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Regional CPPCC Chairman | Zhang Yankun |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0National People's Congress Representation | 58 deputies |\n| Area[1]\n |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Total | 1,183,000\u00a0km2 (457,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Rank | 3rd |\n| Highest\u00a0elevation(Main Peak, Helan Mountains[2])\n | 3,556\u00a0m (11,667\u00a0ft) |\n| Population(2020)[3]\n |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Total | 24,049,155 |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Rank | 25th |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Density | 20/km2 (53/sq\u00a0mi) |\n| \u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0Rank | 28th |\n| Demographics |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Ethnic composition | Han \u2013 78.7%Mongol \u2013 17.7% Others \u2013 3.6% |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Languages and dialects | Mandarin (official),[4] Mongolian (official), Oirat, Buryat, Dagur, Evenki, Jin |\n| ISO 3166 code | CN-NM |\n| GDP[5] | 2022 |\n| \u00a0\u2013 Total | \u00a52,316 trillion (21st)$344 billion (nominal) |\n| \u00a0\u2013 Per capita | \u00a596,474 (8th)$14,343 (nominal) |\n| \u00a0\u2013 Growth | ![Increase](image) 4.2% |\n| HDI (2021) | 0.777[6] (8th) \u2013 high |\n| Website | www.nmg.gov.cn ![Edit this at Wikidata](image) (in Chinese)Mongol version |\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nInner Mongolia is one of the more economically developed provinces in China with annual GDP per capita at US$14,343 (2022), ranked 8th in the nation.

For about ten years since 2000, Inner Mongolia's GDP growth has been the highest in the country, (along with Guangdong) largely owing to the success of natural resource industries in the region. GDP growth has continually been over 10%, even 15% and connections with the Wolf Economy to the north has helped development. However, growth has come at a cost with huge amounts of pollution and degradation to the grasslands.[30] Attempts to attract ethnic Chinese to migrate from other regions, as well as urbanise those rural nomads and peasants has led to huge amounts of corruption and waste in public spending, such as Ordos City.[31][32] Acute uneven wealth distribution has further exacerbated ethnic tensions, many indigenous Mongolians feeling they are increasingly marginalised in their own homeland, leading to riots in 2011 and 2013.[33][34]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
