It was released on November 16, 2004, by Columbia Records and Sony Urban Music. Following the conclusion of promotional activities for their globally successful third studio album *Survivor* (2001), Destiny's Child embarked on a two-year hiatus, during which each member released solo albums to varying levels of success. They reunited in the summer of 2004 to record *Destiny Fulfilled*, primarily at the Sony Music Studios in New York City. Unlike the group's previous recordings, the album saw each member equally contributing to the songwriting and production, drawing inspiration from the events in their lives while being apart.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nwho was the last member to release an album, was regarded the most successful with *Dangerously in Love* (2003). The album debuted atop the US *Billboard* 200, enjoying international commercial success and widespread critical acclaim.[18] Furthermore, it produced two US *Billboard* Hot 100 number-one hits\u2013\"Crazy in Love\" and \"Baby Boy\"[19]\u2013and won five Grammy Awards at the 46th Annual Grammy Awards (2004), causing Beyonc\u00e9 to tie for winning the most Grammy Awards at a single ceremony among women.[f] The members' respective solo achievements led to intense speculation over the disbandment of Destiny's Child. In July 2004, amidst the rumors, Rowland announced the group's return to the studio to record *Destiny Fulfilled*. The group claimed the reunion was destined to happen, and that their affinity for each other kept them together.[1][21]\n\n\n\n## Recording and production[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nKelly* in June 2007;[132] it became her first US *Billboard* 200 top-ten album.[133] During Beyonc\u00e9 and Rowland's respective promotions for their albums, Destiny's Child reunited at the BET Awards 2007 and during Beyonc\u00e9's 2007 world tour The Beyonc\u00e9 Experience.[134][135] Michelle Williams released her third studio album *Unexpected*, which showcased a drastic change in her musical style from gospel to dance-pop, in October 2008.[136] Destiny's Child would not release another album until the compilation album *Love Songs*\u2013which included *Destiny Fulfilled* tracks \"Cater 2 U\", \"T-Shirt\", \"If\" and \"Love\", alongside some of the group's other previous recordings and the newly-recorded \"Nuclear\"\u2013in January 2013.[137]\n\n\n\n## Track listing[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n50. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Horwitz, Carolyn; L.A.; Jeckell, Barry A.
