At the same time, justices appointed at too advanced an age will likely have short tenures on the court.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe youngest justice ever appointed was Joseph Story, 32 at the time of his appointment in 1812; the oldest was Charles Evans Hughes, who was 67 at the time of his appointment as Chief Justice in 1930.

Following the appointment of Ketanji Brown Jackson, the average age of the court is between 61 and 62 years old. By contrast, just prior to the death of Chief Justice William Rehnquist in September 2005, the average age was 71.
