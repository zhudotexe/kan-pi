The oldest person to have served on the court was Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., who stepped down two months shy of his 91st birthday.[124] John Paul Stevens, second only to Holmes,[124] left the court in June 2010, two months after turning 90.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., the oldest justice in history, served on the court until he was 90.\nUnlike the offices of President, U.S. Representative, and U.S. Senator, there is no minimum age for Supreme Court justices set forth in the United States Constitution. However, justices tend to be appointed after having made significant achievements in law or politics, which excludes many young potential candidates from consideration. At the same time, justices appointed at too advanced an age will likely have short tenures on the court.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe youngest justice ever appointed was Joseph Story, 32 at the time of his appointment in 1812; the oldest was Charles Evans Hughes, who was 67 at the time of his appointment as Chief Justice in 1930. (Hughes had previously been appointed to the court as an associate justice in 1910, at the age of 48, but had resigned in 1916 to run for president). Story went on to serve for 33 years, while Hughes served 11 years after his second appointment. The oldest justice at the time of his initial appointment was Horace Lurton, 65 at the time of his appointment in 1909. Lurton died after only four years on the court. The oldest sitting justice to be elevated to Chief Justice was Hughes' successor, Harlan Fiske Stone, who was 68 at the time of his elevation in 1941. Stone died in 1946, only five years after his elevation. The oldest nominee to the court was South Carolina senator William Smith, nominated in 1837, then aged around 75 (it is known that he was born in 1762, but not the exact date). \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Joseph Story was only 32 when he became a justice of the court.\nThe average age of the court as a whole fluctuates over time with the departure of older justices and the appointment of younger people to fill their seats. As of 2022[update], the youngest sitting Justice at the time of appointment is Clarence Thomas, who was 43 years old at the time of his confirmation in 1991. Following the appointment of Ketanji Brown Jackson, the average age of the court is between 61 and 62 years old. By contrast, just prior to the death of Chief Justice William Rehnquist in September 2005, the average age was 71. After Jackson's appointment and confirmation in 2022, the average age of appointment for current justices is between 50 and 51 years old.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCommentators have noted that advances in medical knowledge \"have enormously increased the life expectancy of a mature person of an age likely to be considered for appointment to the Supreme Court\".[126] Combined with the reduction in responsibilities carried out by modern justices as compared to the early justices, this results in much longer potential terms of service.[126] This has led to proposals such as imposing a mandatory retirement age for Supreme Court justices,[127] or predetermined term limits.[128]\n\n\n\n## Educational background[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of law schools attended by United States Supreme Court justices\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe longest period of time in which one group of justices has served together occurred from August 3, 1994, when Stephen Breyer was appointed to replace the retired Harry Blackmun, to September 3, 2005, the death of Rehnquist, totaling 11 years and 31 days. From 1789 until 1970, justices served an average of 14.9 years. Those who have stepped down since 1970 have served an average of 25.6 years. The retirement age had jumped from an average of 68 pre-1970 to 79 for justices retiring post-1970. Between 1789 and 1970 there was a vacancy on the court once every 1.91 years. In the next 34 years since the two appointments in 1971, there was a vacancy on average only once every 3.75 years. The typical one-term president has had one appointment opportunity instead of two.[125]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* **Associate justices:** Clarence Thomas\n* Samuel Alito\n* Sonia Sotomayor\n* Elena Kagan\n* Neil Gorsuch\n* Brett Kavanaugh\n* Amy Coney Barrett\n* Ketanji Brown Jackson\n |\n| Retired justices | * Anthony Kennedy\n* David Souter\n* Stephen Breyer\n |\n| History | * Jay Court (1789\u20131795)\n* Rutledge Court (1795)\n* Ellsworth Court (1796\u20131800)\n* Marshall Court (1801\u20131835)\n* Taney Court (1836\u20131864)\n* Chase Court (1864\u20131873)\n* Waite Court (1874\u20131888)\n* Fuller Court (1888\u20131910)\n* White Court (1910\u20131921)\n* Taft Court (1921\u20131930)\n* Hughes Court (1930\u20131941)\n* Stone Court (1941\u20131946)\n* Vinson Court (1946\u20131953)\n* Warren Court (1953\u20131969)\n* Burger Court (1969\u20131986)\n* Rehnquist Court (1986\u20132005)\n* Roberts Court (2005\u2013present)\n |\n| Lists of justicesand nominees | * Chief justices\n* Associate justices\n* All justices\n\t+ court\n\t+ education\n\t+ seat\n\t+ time in office\n* All nominations\n\t+ unsuccessful\n* Justices who served in Congress\n* Burial places of justices\n |\n| Statutes affectingcourt size | * Judiciary Act of 1789\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Clarence Thomas | Georgia | 1948 | *living* | 1991 | *incumbent* | G.

All Supreme Court justices were males until 1981, when Ronald Reagan fulfilled his 1980 campaign promise to place a woman on the court,[62] which he did with the appointment of Sandra Day O'Connor. O'Connor was later joined on the court by Ruth Bader Ginsburg, appointed by Bill Clinton in 1993. After O'Connor retired in 2006, Ginsburg was joined by Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, who were successfully appointed to the court in 2009 and 2010, respectively, by Barack Obama.[63] In September 2020, following Ginsburg's death, Donald Trump nominated Amy Coney Barrett to succeed her.[64] Barrett was confirmed the following month. Only one woman, Harriet Miers, has been nominated to the court unsuccessfully. Her nomination to succeed O'Connor by George W. Bush was withdrawn under fire from both parties, and also marked the first time when a woman was nominated to replace another woman on the court. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWomen on the Supreme Court\n| Name\n | Appointedfrom\n | Birth\n | Death\n | Yearappointed\n | Leftoffice\n | Appointed by\n | Reason fordeparture\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Sandra Day O'Connor | Arizona | 1930 | *living* | 1981 | 2006 | Reagan | retirement\n |\n| Ruth Bader Ginsburg | New York | 1933 | 2020 | 1993 | 2020 | Clinton | death\n |\n| Sonia Sotomayor | New York | 1954 | *living* | 2009 | *incumbent* | Obama | \u2014\n |\n| Elena Kagan | New York | 1960 | *living* | 2010 | *incumbent* | Obama | \u2014\n |\n| Amy Coney Barrett | Indiana | 1972 | *living* | 2020 | *incumbent* | Trump | \u2014\n |\n| Ketanji Brown Jackson | Washington, D.C. | 1970 | *living* | 2022 | *incumbent* | Biden | \u2014\n |\n\n\nGraphical timeline of female justices:\n\n\n\n![](image)\n\n## Marital status and sexual orientation[edit]\n\n\n### Marital status[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Milford Central School* (determining the freedom of religious speech in relation to the First Amendment) and *New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen* (affirming the individual right to bear arms outside the home), as well as his dissent in *Gonzales v. Raich* (arguing that Congress may not criminalize the private cultivation of medical marijuana). He is widely considered the Court's most conservative member.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
