For economically diverse large population groups, a much higher coefficient is expected than for each of its regions. For example, taking the world economy as a whole and income distribution for all human beings, different scholars estimate the global Gini index to range between 0.61 and 0.68.[12][13]\nAs with other inequality coefficients, the Gini coefficient is influenced by the granularity of the measurements. For example, five 20% quantiles (low granularity) will usually yield a lower Gini coefficient than twenty 5% quantiles (high granularity) for the same distribution. Philippe Monfort has shown that using inconsistent or unspecified granularity limits the usefulness of Gini coefficient measurements.[80]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nEven when the total income of a population is the same, in certain situations two countries with different income distributions can have the same Gini index (e.g. cases when income Lorenz Curves cross).[45] Table A illustrates one such situation. Both countries have a Gini coefficient of 0.2, but the average income distributions for household groups are different. As another example, in a population where the lowest 50% of individuals have no income, and the other 50% have equal income, the Gini coefficient is 0.5; whereas for another population where the lowest 75% of people have 25% of income and the top 25% have 75% of the income, the Gini index is also 0.5. Economies with similar incomes and Gini coefficients can have very different income distributions. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nEducation Gini index estimates the inequality in education for a given population.[59] It is used to discern trends in social development through educational attainment over time. A study across 85 countries by three World Bank economists, Vinod Thomas, Yan Wang, and Xibo Fan, estimated Mali had the highest education Gini index of 0.92 in 1990 (implying very high inequality in educational attainment across the population), while the United States had the lowest education inequality Gini index of 0.14. Between 1960 and 1990, China, India and South Korea had the fastest drop in education inequality Gini Index. They also claim education Gini index for the United States slightly increased over the 1980–1990 period.\n\n\n  \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nExtreme wealth inequality, yet low-income Gini coefficient\nA Gini index does not contain information about absolute national or personal incomes. Populations can simultaneously have very low-income Gini indices and very high wealth Gini indexes. By measuring inequality in income, the Gini ignores the differential efficiency of the use of household income. By ignoring wealth (except as it contributes to income), the Gini can create the appearance of inequality when the people compared are at different stages in their life. Wealthy countries such as Sweden can show a low Gini coefficient for the disposable income of 0.31, thereby appearing equal, yet have a very high Gini coefficient for wealth of 0.79 to 0.86, suggesting an extremely unequal wealth distribution in its society.[77][78] These factors are not assessed in income-based Gini.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTaking income distribution of all human beings, worldwide income inequality has been constantly increasing since the early 19th century (and will keep on increasing over the years) . There was a steady increase in the global income inequality Gini score from 1820 to 2002, with a significant increase between 1980 and 2002. This trend appears to have peaked and begun a reversal with rapid economic growth in emerging economies, particularly in the large populations of BRIC countries.[53]\n\n\nThe table below presents the estimated world income Gini coefficients over the last 200 years, as calculated by Milanovic.[54]\n\n\n\n\n\nIncome Gini coefficient - World, 1820–2005\n| Year | World Gini coefficients[12][52][55] |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1820 | 0.43\n |\n| 1850 | 0.53\n |\n| 1870 | 0.56\n |\n| 1913 | 0.61\n |\n| 1929 | 0.62\n |\n| 1950 | 0.64\n |\n| 1960 | 0.64\n |\n| 1980 | 0.66\n |\n| 2002 | 0.71\n |\n| 2005 | 0.68\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn economics, the **Gini coefficient** (/ˈdʒiːni/ *JEE-nee*), also known as the **Gini index** or **Gini ratio**, is a measure of statistical dispersion intended to represent the income inequality, the wealth inequality, or the consumption inequality[3] within a nation or a social group.
