          "content": "<document>\n<title>History of the Boston Celtics</title>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Celtics won a hard-fought five game series with the 76ers in the first round, 3 games to 2. Pierce scored 46 points in the series-clinching blowout at the Fleet Center. In the conference semifinals the Celtics defeated the favored Detroit Pistons 4 games to 1 in a series best remembered for the Celtics low-scoring (66\u201364) game 3 victory. In their first trip to the Eastern Conference Finals since 1988, the Celtics would jump out to a 2\u20131 series lead over the New Jersey Nets (after rallying from 21 points down in the fourth quarter to win game 3) but would lose the next three games to fall 4 games to 2.\n\n\nFollowing their defeat at the hands of the Nets, the Celtics once again overhauled their roster. Gone were Rodney Rogers, who signed with new rival New Jersey as a free agent, Vitaly Potapenko, Kenny Anderson and Joe Forte, who were sent to Seattle in a five-player trade that brought Vin Baker and Shammond Williams to Boston.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the playoffs, the Celtics faced the Atlanta Hawks in the first round, beating them in six games led by strong play from Pierce and Garnett. In the Conference Semifinals the Celtics faced the Philadelphia 76ers led by Doug Collins and a young group of promising players that would push the Celtics into a full-seven game series. Following a Game 7 85\u201375 win the Celtics faced the Miami Heat in the Eastern Conference Finals, who had defeated them in the playoffs the previous year. After losing Game 1 93\u201379, Boston fought back, pushing Miami into a Game 2 overtime, but ultimately fell short losing 115\u2013111. Facing a 0\u20132 deficit heading back to Boston, the Celtics would come back with a strong 101\u201391 Game 3 win and then a hard-fought 93\u201391 Game 4 overtime win, with Dwyane Wade missing a potential game-winning three-point shot at the buzzer. The C's then won Game 5 in Miami 94\u201390, giving them a chance to take the series back at the Garden. The Celtics could not close out the series, however. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe regular season had the Celtics finish with a league-high 66\u201316 record, which was also the most wins in a single season since their previous championship season of 1986. Their record guaranteed them home court advantage for the entire playoffs. The 2008 NBA Playoffs, however, were bumpier than many believed they should be. Their First round series was against the eighth-seeded Atlanta Hawks. At home, the Celtics were dominant: their lowest home margin of victory against the Hawks in the playoffs was 19, in Game 2. However, the Hawks were able to beat the Celtics in Atlanta. The series went seven games, with the home team winning each game. The second round against LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers also went to seven games, with each match won by the home team.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIndicating the bumpy the playoffs were for the Celtics, they had to play 26 playoff games, the most a team had ever endured in a single postseason, surpassing the 1994 New York Knicks, whom Celtics Coach Doc Rivers played for, and the 2005 Detroit Pistons, each of whom played 25, but lost their respective finals in seven games (Knicks in 1994, Pistons in 2005). This record was set in Game 6 of the Finals.[65] It was also the most a team needed to win a championship, surpassing the 1988 Los Angeles Lakers, who needed 24 in order to win the championship that year.[65]\n\n\n\n### After the championship[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThen on February 18, the Celtics signed swingman Terrence Williams to a deal. On February 21, the Celtics traded Leandro Barbosa and center Jason Collins for Washington Wizards guard Jordan Crawford. On February 28 and March 21, respectively, the Celtics signed forwards D. J. White and Shavlik Randolph.[66][67]\n\n\nThe Celtics finished the season with 41 wins, but played only 81 games after a home game against the Indiana Pacers on April 16 was cancelled following the Boston Marathon bombing; the game was not made up with both teams already assured of their playoff positions.[68] The 41 wins were the lowest totals the Celtics achieved as a playoff-bound team since 2004. The Celtics trailed 3\u20130 to the New York Knicks in the first round of the 2013 NBA Playoffs, before losing the series in six games. In Game 6, the Celtics nearly completed a comeback when they went on a 20\u20130 run to cut the lead to 4, but that was the closest they got as the New York Knicks would take over to win.[69]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)The Celtics during the tip-off game of the 2008\u201309 season. Clockwise from top: Paul Pierce (34), Kevin Garnett embracing Rajon Rondo, Ray Allen (20) and Tony Allen (42).\nThe Celtics followed up the championship season with more dominance, winning the Atlantic Division with a record of 62\u201320. Unfortunately, it was announced just before the playoffs that Garnett would miss the entire post-season. In the first round of the 2009 NBA Playoffs, the team faced the seventh seed Chicago Bulls. Although the Celtics were favored, the Bulls surprised them with overtime wins in games 1 and 4. Thanks to Ray Allen and Paul Pierce, Boston had a 3\u20132 advantage going back to Chicago. In game six, though Ray Allen scored 51 points, the Bulls would win in a dramatic triple-overtime victory thanks to John Salmons, Ben Gordon and eventual NBA Rookie of the Year Derrick Rose. The Celtics, however would ultimately prevail in game 7.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe first few games of the series started with the Celtics once again dominating at the TD Banknorth Garden, the Celtics home turf. Game 1 saw Paul Pierce come back after apparently suffering a knee injury earlier in the game, and taking over the game for a 98\u201388 Celtics win. But in Game 2, Boston nearly lost a 20-point lead, ultimately winning, 97\u201391. Squandered leads would later become the story of the series. When the Lakers returned to Staples Center and won Game 3, 87\u201381, then took a 24-point lead in the second quarter of Game 4, some believed momentum in the series had shifted the Lakers' way.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the Eastern Conference Finals, the Celtics faced Chauncey Billups, Richard Hamilton and the Detroit Pistons. In Game 2, the Celtics finally lost at home, and rumors began to fly that the Celtics had gotten too tired from consecutive seven-game series to pull off a title, especially with the Pistons having taken their first two series in six and five games, respectively. But the Celtics bounced back to win Game 3 on the road in Detroit. The series continued, and the Celtics took down the Pistons in six games, winning the deciding game on the road.\n\n\nThe 2008 NBA Finals were contested with Kobe Bryant, Pau Gasol, Lamar Odom and a Los Angeles Lakers team in the middle of a dominant playoff run. They swept the Denver Nuggets in the first round, took the Utah Jazz in the second round in six games, and extinguished the repeat hopes of the defending-champion San Antonio Spurs in five games in the Western Conference Finals.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nStill, with Pierce playing at his usual level, Davis providing a second scoring punch, and occasional help from rookie Marcus Banks at point guard the Celtics prepared for yet another playoff run. In February, the Celtics helped their former nemeses, the Detroit Pistons acquire Rasheed Wallace for their own title run, sending Mike James off to Detroit in exchange for a 1st-round pick as well as Chucky Atkins, who would provide the Celtics with a stabilizing veteran point guard to go with the inconsistent Banks. The Celtics made the playoffs only to be badly swept in the first round by the Indiana Pacers losing all 4 by blowout margins.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHowever, the Bucks won Game 6 when Kareem Abdul-Jabbar nestled in a hook shot with three seconds left in the game's second overtime, and the series returned to Milwaukee. But Cowens was the hero in Game 7, scoring 28 points, as the Celtics brought the title back to Boston for the first time in five years. In 1976, the team won yet another championship, defeating the Phoenix Suns in 6 games. The Celtics advanced to the 1976 NBA Finals, which featured one of the greatest games in the history of the NBA. With the series tied at two games apiece, the Suns trailed early in the Boston Garden, but came back to force overtime. In double overtime, a Gar Heard turn-around jumper at the top of the key sent the game to a third overtime, at which point the Celtics prevailed.[23] Tommy Heinsohn coached the team for those two championships. After the 1976 championship and a playoff appearance in 1977, Boston went into another phase of rebuilding.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n70. **^** \"Nets, Celtics work out blockbuster\". ESPN.

They had a hot start, led by Isaiah Thomas. He truly emerged as a star, and with the help of Boston's excellent depth, Boston finished as the #1 seed in the Eastern Conference, with a 53\u201329 record. Just before the Celtics' first round playoff series against the Chicago Bulls, Thomas' sister Chyna died in a car crash. That led to Thomas being even more dominant, and Boston took the series in six after losing the first two games. That series win was the first since 2012. In the second round, Boston faced the Washington Wizards. Thomas dropped 33 and 53 points on them in Games 1 and 2, respectively. Boston took the series in 7. In the Eastern Conference Finals, Boston faced the Cleveland Cavaliers. Thomas got a hip injury and was ruled out for the season, and the Cavs won the series in five.\n\n\n\n### 2021-present: Under Ime Udoka and NBA Finals appearance[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Celtics, however, continued to struggle, at one point posting a five-game losing streak that was the longest in the 'Big Three' era. At the All Star break, the Celtics were below .500 with a 15\u201317 record. However, they were one of the hottest teams after the break, going 24\u201310 the rest of the year and winning their 5th division title in a row. The Celtics would end up making the playoffs as the fourth seed in the Eastern Conference in the 2012 NBA Playoffs.\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

          "content": "<document>\n<title>History of the Philadelphia 76ers</title>\n<fragment>\nThe 76ers were given little chance of winning as they faced the Celtics in Game Seven at Boston Garden. This time, they played angrily but inspired basketball, pulling away to a 120\u2013106 victory. In the game's closing moments, the Boston Garden fans began chanting *\"Beat L.A., Beat L.A.\"*, an incredible moment in basketball history, wherein, for seemingly the first time the opposing team's fans (Boston), realizing their team would lose the playoff series to a hated opponent (Philadelphia), nonetheless during the very game their team (Boston) was losing to the opponent (Philadelphia), openly wished that opponent (Philadelphia) good luck in the next round against a more hated opponent (Los Angeles).[12] Although they lost in the NBA Finals, the 76ers began the 1982\u201383 season with great momentum. All they needed now was Moses to lead them to the promised land of the NBA championship.\n\n\n\n### 1982\u201383 season[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPhiladelphia earned the eighth seed in the 2012 NBA playoffs, facing the 1st-seeded Chicago Bulls. Philadelphia improved from their struggles in the second half of the regular season, beating Chicago 4\u20132 to win their first series since 2003. This was the fifth time in NBA history that an eight seed has beaten one seed. They then faced their rival, the Boston Celtics, in the second round, and were eliminated 4\u20133. The Sixers once again faced criticism for their lack of a true scorer, as they were not able to keep pace with the Celtics' scoring. They were, however, given credit for winning the regular-season series against Boston and forcing the playoff series to seven games against the Celtics, who had won the last four division championships.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### 2012\u201313 season[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe 76ers went into the 2001\u201302 season with high expectations, but were able to produce only a 43\u201339 record, sixth in the Eastern Conference. In the first round of the playoffs, Philadelphia was defeated by the Boston Celtics, three games to two. In 2002\u201303, the 76ers sprinted to a 15\u20134 start, but a 10\u201320 swoon left them 25\u201324 at the All-Star break. After the break, the 76ers caught fire, winning nine in a row at one point, and 23 of their last 33 to finish at 48\u201334, earning the fourth seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs. Iverson scored 55 points in the playoff opener against the New Orleans Hornets and the Sixers went on to win the series in six games. In the second round, the Detroit Pistons ended Philadelphia's playoff run in a frustrating six-game series that saw the 76ers lose twice in overtime, and once on a last-second shot in regulation. It would be nine years before the Sixers won another playoff series.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHowever, the Sixers couldn't find the form that pushed them to the playoffs last year. The Sixers started the year with a 9\u201314 record before firing head coach Maurice Cheeks on December 13. Assistant GM Tony DiLeo took over and the Sixers gradually improved. They finished the season with a 41\u201341 record, with a 32\u201327 record under DiLeo. Brand's first season with the Sixers ended early with a right shoulder injury that required surgery. Despite the loss of Brand, the Sixers earned a playoff berth with a 95\u201390 win against the Detroit Pistons on April 4, 2009, at home.\n\n\nIn the first round, they faced the Orlando Magic. Three of the first four games of the series provided late-game heroics. Iguodala and Thaddeus Young made game-winning shots in Games 1 and 3, respectively, while Orlando's Hedo T\u00fcrko\u011flu provided the game-winner in Game 4. Just like in the previous year's playoffs, the Sixers led 2\u20131 after three games, but the Magic won three straight to eliminate the Sixers from the playoffs.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the first round of the playoffs, Philadelphia faced Indiana yet again. In Game One, the 76ers wasted an 18-point lead and lost, 79\u201378, when Reggie Miller hit a three-pointer in the closing seconds. Philadelphia fought back, however, and took the next three games to win the series. In the Eastern Conference Semifinals, the Sixers squared off against the Toronto Raptors and their superstar, Vince Carter. The teams alternated wins in the first four games, with Iverson scoring 54 points in Philadelphia's Game Two victory. A Game Five win (with Iverson scoring 52 in a 121\u201388 rout) and Game Six loss set up a decisive Game Seven, which the 76ers survived as Carter missed a long jump shot at the buzzer for an 88\u201387 victory that sent the Sixers to the Eastern Conference Finals against the Milwaukee Bucks. After the teams split the first two games of the series in Philadelphia, it was learned Iverson would miss Game Three due to various nagging injuries that had plagued him late in the season. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAs had been the case in their three previous Finals appearances, their opponent would be the Los Angeles Lakers, who had run up an 11\u20130 record in the first three rounds of the playoffs and were expected by many to make quick work of a worn-down 76ers squad. Because of a seemingly meaningless loss to the lowly Chicago Bulls in the regular season finale (both the Sixers and the Lakers finished with identical 56\u201326 records, but Los Angeles was awarded a higher seed based on tiebreakers), the NBA Finals marked the first time in the 2001 playoffs in which the 76ers had to start a series on the road.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the 1967\u201368 season, with a new home court in the form of The Spectrum to defend their championship, the 76ers had the NBA's best record for the third consecutive season. Chamberlain won his third consecutive MVP award after leading the NBA in rebounds, assists, and field goal percentage. Greer and Chamberlain both averaged over 24 points per game, and once again the 76ers made it back to the NBA Playoffs. In a rematch of the previous year's semifinals, the 76ers held a 3\u20131 series lead over the Celtics, before the Celtics staged a dramatic comeback to beat the Sixers in seven games.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Sixers started the season with an uninspiring 3\u201313 mark, but started turning things around, to finish with a 41\u201341 record. They clinched a playoff berth on April 1, 2011, their third in the last four years. The 76ers faced the heavily favored Miami Heat in the first round, and ultimately fell to them in five games. Although they lost the series, Collins was praised for turning around a lottery team in his first season, as well as winning a playoff game when many pundits predicted that the Sixers would be swept. Collins also finished second in Coach of the Year voting.\n\n\n\n### 2011\u201312 season[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThat led to the 1977\u201378 motto of \"We owe you one\", which would ultimately backfire when they lost in the conference finals that season to the Washington Bullets, who went on to win the NBA championship. In the next four seasons, the 76ers would fall short of the NBA Championship, even after Shue handed the coaching reins to former great Billy Cunningham. In the 1980 NBA Finals against the Los Angeles Lakers, they lost, four games to two. In Game Six, rookie Magic Johnson played center for the Lakers in place of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (who was out because of a sprained ankle sustained in Game Five) and scored 42 points. In the 1981 Eastern Conference Finals, the 76ers opened a 3\u20131 series lead over the Celtics only to see Boston come back and win the series in seven games. The following season, the 76ers again faced the Celtics in the Eastern Conference Finals, and again jumped to a 3\u20131 series lead only to see Boston forge a 3\u20133 series tie. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLed by Erving, the 76ers began an exciting ride for the fans of Philadelphia, beating their long-time rival from Boston in a seven-game playoff to advance to the Eastern Conference Finals. There, they defeated the Houston Rockets, led by future 76er Moses Malone, in six games to advance to the NBA Finals. In the Finals, they sprinted to a 2\u20130 series lead over the Bill Walton-led Portland Trail Blazers\u2014who was coached by former Sixers coach/general manager Jack Ramsay\u2014only to drop the next four games in a row to give the Blazers the title.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | This section **needs expansion**. You can help by adding to it. *(April 2021)*\n |\n\n\nOn November 12, 2018, the 76ers traded \u0160ari\u0107, Robert Covington, Jerryd Bayless and a 2022 second-round draft pick to the Minnesota Timberwolves in exchange for Jimmy Butler and Justin Patton.[7]\n\n\nOn February 6, 2019, the 76ers acquired forward Tobias Harris, as well as Boban Marjanovi\u0107 and Mike Scott, in a trade with the Los Angeles Clippers, sending Wilson Chandler, Mike Muscala, Landry Shamet, a protected 2020 first-round pick, Miami's unprotected 2021 first-round pick and Detroit's 2021 and 2023 second-round pick to the Clippers. The 76ers completed the season as the third seed. In the playoffs, the 76ers defeated the Brooklyn Nets in five games in the conference first round, but lost in the conference semifinals to the Toronto Raptors in seven games. This is because Kawhi Leonard scored the first-ever game 7 buzzer beater in NBA history.\n\n\n\n### 2019\u201320 season[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLed by head coach Alex Hannum, the 76ers had a dream season as they started 46\u20134,[8] en route to a record of 68\u201313, the best record in league history at the time.[9] Chamberlain set a then-NBA-record with his league-leading 0.683 field goal percentage, and again led the NBA in rebounding with 24.2 boards per game. Chamberlain, Billy Cunningham, and Hal Greer, along with all-stars Chet Walker, Lucious Jackson and Wali Jones led the team to the semifinals. This time the 76ers beat the Celtics in five games. In Game Five of that series, as the 76ers went to victory and the NBA Finals, Philadelphia fans chanted \"Boston is dead!\"\u2014a symbol that the Celts' eight-year reign as NBA champion had ended. The Finals were almost anticlimactic, with the Sixers ousting the Warriors in six games to give them their second NBA Championship. The 1966\u201367 Sixers were voted the best team in league history during the NBA's 35th anniversary celebration.\n\n\n\n## 1967\u20131976: Fall of the 76ers[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHowever, the 76ers backed up Malone's boast. They made a mockery of the Eastern Conference playoffs, first sweeping the New York Knicks and then beating the Milwaukee Bucks in five games. The 76ers went on to win their third NBA championship (and second in Philadelphia) with a four-game sweep of the Los Angeles Lakers, who had defeated them the season before. Malone was named the playoffs' MVP. The 76ers didn't quite fulfill Malone's prediction, as their run was actually \"fo', fi', fo\" (\"four, five, four\") \u2013 a loss to the Bucks in game four of the Eastern finals being the only blemish on their playoff run. Nonetheless, their 12\u20131 playoff record is tied for the fewest losses in league history with the 2000\u20132001 Lakers, who went 15\u20131 en route to the NBA Title, coincidentally beating the 76ers in the Finals (after suffering their only defeat that postseason in Game 1), and the 2016-17 Golden State Warriors, who finished the 2017 NBA postseason 16\u20131. \n</fragment>\n</document>",
