Two accounts suggest the rates of change are 4\u00a0mm (0.16\u00a0in) per year vertically and 3 to 6\u00a0mm (0.12 to 0.24\u00a0in) per year horizontally,[36][44] but another account mentions more lateral movement (27\u00a0mm or 1.1\u00a0in),[45] and even shrinkage has been suggested.[46]\n\n\n\n### Comparisons[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of highest mountains on Earth.\n\nThe summit of Everest is the point at which Earth's surface reaches the greatest distance above sea level. Several other mountains are sometimes claimed to be the \"tallest mountains on Earth\". Mauna Kea in Hawaii is tallest when measured from its base;[note 5] it rises over 10,200\u00a0m (33,464.6\u00a0ft) when measured from its base on the mid-ocean floor, but only attains 4,205\u00a0m (13,796\u00a0ft) above sea level.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNearby peaks include Lhotse, 8,516\u00a0m (27,940\u00a0ft); Nuptse, 7,855\u00a0m (25,771\u00a0ft), and Changtse, 7,580\u00a0m (24,870\u00a0ft) among others. Another nearby peak is Khumbutse, and many of the highest mountains in the world are near Mount Everest. On the southwest side, a major feature in the lower areas is the Khumbu icefall and glacier, an obstacle to climbers on those routes but also to the base camps.\n\n\n\n![](image)\nSouthern and northern climbing routes as seen from the International Space Station.

It stands over 3,000 metres (9,840\u00a0ft) above much of the glacial valley bottoms at its base. It is a consistently steep pyramid, dropping quickly in almost all directions. The north side is the steepest: there it rises over 3,200 metres (10,500\u00a0ft) above the K2 (Qogir) Glacier in only 3,000 metres (9,800\u00a0ft) of horizontal distance. In most directions, it achieves over 2,800 metres (9,200\u00a0ft) of vertical relief in less than 4,000 metres (13,000\u00a0ft).[28]\n\n\nA 1986 expedition led by George Wallerstein made an inaccurate measurement showing that K2 was taller than Mount Everest, and therefore the tallest mountain in the world.[29] A corrected measurement was made in 1987, but by then the claim that K2 was the tallest mountain in the world had already made it into many news reports and reference works.[30]\n\n\n\n## Height[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nSeven Second Summits\n |\n| --- |\n| Asia | * **K2** (8,611\u00a0m or 28,251\u00a0ft)\n |\n| South America | * **Ojos del Salado** (6,893\u00a0m or 22,615\u00a0ft)\n |\n| North America | * **Mount Logan** (5,959\u00a0m or 19,551\u00a0ft)\n |\n| Europe | * **Dykh-Tau** (5,205\u00a0m or 17,077\u00a0ft)\n* or **Dufourspitze** (4,634\u00a0m or 15,203\u00a0ft)\n |\n| Africa | * **Mount Kenya** (5,199\u00a0m or 17,057\u00a0ft)\n |\n| Antarctica | * **Mount Tyree** (4,852\u00a0m or 15,919\u00a0ft)\n |\n| Oceania | * **Puncak Mandala** (4,760\u00a0m or 15,617\u00a0ft)\n |\n| Australia | * **Mount Townsend** (2,209\u00a0m or 7,247\u00a0ft)\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**K2**, at 8,611 metres (28,251\u00a0ft) above sea level, is the second-highest mountain on Earth, after Mount Everest at 8,849 metres (29,032\u00a0ft).[3] It lies in the Karakoram range, partially in the Gilgit-Baltistan region of Pakistan-administered Kashmir and partially in the China-administered Trans-Karakoram Tract in the Taxkorgan Tajik Autonomous County of Xinjiang.[4][5][6][a]\n\n\nK2 also became popularly known as the *Savage Mountain* after George Bell\u2014a climber on the 1953 American expedition\u2014told reporters, \"It's a savage mountain that tries to kill you.\"[7] Of the five highest mountains in the world, K2 is the deadliest; approximately one person dies on the mountain for every four who reach the summit.[7][8] Also occasionally known as *Mount Godwin-Austen*,[9] other nicknames for K2 are *The King of Mountains* and *The Mountaineers' Mountain*,[10] as well as *The Mountain of Mountains* after prominent Italian climber Reinhold Messner titled his book about K2 the same.[11]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* K10\n\t+ Saltoro Kangri I\n* K11\n\t+ Saltoro Kangri II\n* K12\n* K13\n\t+ Dansam\n* K22\n\t+ Saser Kangri I\n* K25\n\t+ Pastan Kangri\n* K35\n\t+ Mamostong Kangri\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nEight-thousanders (and major subsidiary peaks)\n |\n| --- |\n| * Everest\n\t+ South Summit\n* K2\n* Kangchenjunga\n* Lhotse\n\t+ Lhotse Middle\n\t+ Lhotse Shar\n* Makalu\n* Cho Oyu\n* Dhaulagiri\n* Manaslu\n* Nanga Parbat\n* Annapurna I\n\t+ Annapurna I East\n\t+ Annapurna I Middle Peak\n* Gasherbrum I\n* Broad Peak\n* Gasherbrum II\n* Shishapangma\n |\n| * List of ski descents of eight-thousanders\n* List of climbers summiting all eight-thousanders\n* List of deaths on eight-thousanders\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

After allowing for further verification of all calculations, it was officially announced in 1856 that Kangchenjunga was the third-highest mountain.[6]\n\n\nThe Kangchenjunga is a sacred mountain in Nepal and Sikkim and was first climbed on 25 May 1955 by Joe Brown and George Band, who were part of the 1955 British Kangchenjunga expedition. They stopped just short of the true summit, keeping a promise given to Tashi Namgyal, the Chogyal of Sikkim, that the top of the mountain would remain inviolate.[7] The Indian side of the mountain is off-limits to climbers. In 2016, the adjoining Khangchendzonga National Park was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n51. **^** Mysza (2009). *Kinga Baranowska zdoby\u0142a Kangchenjung\u0119* Archived 11 March 2013 at the Wayback Machine. wspinanie.pl, 18 May 2009.\n52. **^** \"Tun\u00e7 F\u0131nd\u0131k zirvede\".

It is located in the Mahalangur Himalayas 19\u00a0km (12\u00a0mi) southeast of Mount Everest, on the China\u2013Nepal border. One of the eight-thousanders, Makalu is an isolated peak in the shape of a four-sided pyramid.\n\n\nMakalu has two notable subsidiary peaks. Kangchungtse, or Makalu II (7,678\u00a0m) lies about three kilometres (two miles) north-northwest of the main summit. Rising about 5\u00a0km (3\u00a0mi) north-northeast of the main summit across a broad plateau, and connected to Kangchungtse by a narrow, 7,200\u00a0m saddle, is Chomo Lonzo (7,804\u00a0m).\n\n\n\n\n## Climbing history[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nEight-thousander and 5th-highest mountain on Earth, located in Nepal and China\n\nFor other uses, see Makalu (disambiguation).\n\n\"Makaru\" redirects here.
