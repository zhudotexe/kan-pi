Since her career progressed in the 1990s, she has become one of the world's highest-paid actresses.[1]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDepressed over her four unsuccessful television shows, Aniston approached Warren Littlefield at a Los Angeles gas station asking for reassurance. As the head of NBC entertainment, he encouraged her to continue acting, and a few months later helped cast her in *Friends*,[20][17] a sitcom set to debut on NBC's 1994\u20131995 fall lineup. The producer wanted Aniston to audition for the role of Monica Geller,[21] but Courteney Cox was deemed more suitable, and Aniston was cast as Rachel Green. She was also offered a spot as a featured player on *Saturday Night Live*, but turned it down in favor of *Friends*.[22] She played Rachel until the show ended in 2004, when Aniston took a 15-year hiatus from television save for occasional guest roles.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

While still acting in *Friends*, his first leading film role was in *The Pallbearer* (1996), followed by roles in *Kissing a Fool*, *Six Days, Seven Nights*, *Apt Pupil* (all 1998), and *Picking Up the Pieces* (2000). He was then cast in the miniseries *Band of Brothers* (2001) as Herbert Sobel.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 1994, Schwimmer was cast as Ross Geller in NBC's situation comedy *Friends*, a series that revolved around a group of friends who live near each other in Manhattan. He played a hopeless-romantic paleontologist who works at a museum and later becomes a professor at a university. Schwimmer initially turned down the role as Ross, but accepted later.[13] Executive producer Kevin S. Bright said that he had previously worked with Schwimmer,[14] the character of Ross was written with him in mind, and he was the first actor cast.[13] The show debuted on September 22, 1994, and was watched by almost 22 million American viewers.[15] *Friends* quickly developed a loyal audience, with the show and Schwimmer receiving strong reviews. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1989\n | *A Deadly Silence* | Rob Cuccio\n | TV movie |\n| 1991\u20131992\n | *The Wonder Years* | Michael\n | 4 episodes (seasons 4-5)\n |\n| 1992\u20131993\n | *L.A.
