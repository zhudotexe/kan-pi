A lot of classic (older) circuits have hosted Grands Prix using different configurations throughout their history: N\u00fcrburgring, Spa-Francorchamps, Monza, etc. Taking N\u00fcrburgring as an example, the first World Championship race there used the 22.835\u00a0km (14.189\u00a0mi) configuration, but concerns over safety meant that more recent Grands Prix have used a shorter, safer circuit.[5] Formula One circuits were predominantly in Europe during the early years of the championship; as the sport has expanded, so has the location of its circuits. The expansion into Asia and America has been a recent occurrence. \n</fragment>\n</document>",

The latter was not retained in 2005. In 2008, GP2 Asia Series became a support event while Formula BMW Asia was renamed Formula BMW Pacific. 2009 saw Porsche Carrera Cup Asia as the only support event. It remained this way until TCR International Series became a support event in 2015, although this lasted only one year. In 2019, the most recent edition of the Chinese Grand Prix, China Formula Grand Prix and Shell Helix FIA F4 Chinese Championship became support events.\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFormula One Grand Prix\nThis article is about the Formula One race.

At least for a while. Cost too high, returns limited. When we first hosted the F1 it was a big deal. First in Asia outside Japan. Now so many venues. No first mover advantage. Not a novelty.\"[13] The BBC reported that \"Malaysia had struggled in recent years to attract a significant crowd, its appeal having been damaged by the more glamorous night-time event on a street track in Singapore.\"[14]\n\n\n\n## Winners of the Malaysian Grand Prix[edit]\n\n\n### Repeat winners (drivers)[edit]\n\n\n*A pink background indicates an event which was not part of the Formula One World Championship.*\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Ecclestone also acknowledged that the failure of the Korean and Indian Grands Prix left him doubtful of the long-term viability of a race in Vietnam.[5]\n\n\nThe idea was revived after Liberty Media purchased the commercial rights to the sport from CVC Capital Partners in January 2017. The Vietnamese Grand Prix was announced in November 2018, becoming the first new race under Liberty Media's ownership.[6] The race would join the existing Grand Prix held in Southeast Asia, the Singapore Grand Prix.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nProposed Formula One Grand Prix\n\n\n\n![](image) Vietnamese Grand Prix| Hanoi Circuit |\n| ![](image) |\n| Race information |\n| Circuit length | 5.613\u00a0km (3.488\u00a0miles) |\n| Race length | 308.715\u00a0km (191.826\u00a0miles) |\n| Laps | 55 |\n\n\nThe **Vietnamese Grand Prix** (Vietnamese: *Gi\u1ea3i \u0111ua xe C\u00f4ng th\u1ee9c 1 Vi\u1ec7t Nam*, lit.\u2009'The Vietnamese Formula 1 race')[1] was a proposed Formula One Grand Prix that was first due to take place in April 2020.[2] The race was initially postponed and later cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and was postponed indefinitely.[3] The Grand Prix was removed from the 2021 calendar because of the arrest of Hanoi People's Committee Chairman Nguy\u1ec5n \u0110\u1ee9c Chung on corruption charges unrelated to the Grand Prix.[4]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFormula One Grand Prix races are intended to be held on a 5.613\u00a0km (3.488\u00a0mi) temporary street circuit on the streets of Hanoi. The circuit, going anticlockwise, was designed by Hermann Tilke in collaboration with City of Hanoi authorities.[9] The circuit was initially to feature a hybrid of public roads and a purpose-built section which was planned to be opened to the public in the future.[10] An additional corner was later added to the third sector of the circuit by organisers for safety reasons, making a total of 23 turns.[9]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n7. **^** Benson, Andrew (10 November 2020). \"Vietnamese Grand Prix dropped for 2021\". *BBC Sport*.

It was designed by Carsten Tilke, son of the famed circuit designer, Hermann Tilke.[26][27]\n\n\nIn Formula One, the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix race and qualifying are both held during the night, under the lights where the temperatures are substantially cooler than the day. The Formula 2 race is held during the day and two of the three Formula One practice sessions are held during daytime and high track temperatures.\n\n\n\n## Winners[edit]\n\n\n### Repeat winners (constructors)[edit]\n\n\n*Teams **in bold** are competing in the Formula One championship in the current season.*  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Wins\n | Constructor\n | Years won\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 2\n | ![Austria](image) **Red Bull Racing** | 2022, 2023 |\n| Source:[28] |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nFormula One Grands Prix\n |\n| --- |\n| Current (2024) | * Bahrain\n* Saudi Arabian\n* Australian\n* Japanese\n* Chinese\n* Miami\n* Emilia Romagna\n* Monaco\n* Canadian\n* Spanish\n* Austrian\n* British\n* Hungarian\n* Belgian\n* Dutch\n* Italian\n* Azerbaijan\n* Singapore\n* United States\n* Mexico City\n* S\u00e3o Paulo\n* Las Vegas\n* Qatar\n* Abu Dhabi\n |\n| Former | * 70th Anniversary\n* Argentine\n* Brazilian\n* Caesars Palace\n* Dallas\n* Detroit\n* Eifel\n* European\n* French\n* German\n* Indian\n* Indianapolis 500\n* Korean\n* Luxembourg\n* Malaysian\n* Mexican\n* Moroccan\n* Pacific\n* Pescara\n* Portuguese\n* Russian\n* Sakhir\n* San Marino\n* South African\n* Styrian\n* Swedish\n* Swiss\n* Turkish\n* Tuscan\n* United States West\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFormula One Grand Prix\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n![](image) Saudi Arabian Grand Prix| Jeddah Corniche Circuit(2021\u2013present) |\n| ![](image) |\n| Race information |\n| Number of times held | 3 |\n| First held | 2021 |\n| Most wins (drivers) | ![United Kingdom](image) Lewis Hamilton![Mexico](image) Sergio P\u00e9rez![Netherlands](image) Max Verstappen (1) |\n| Most wins (constructors) | ![Austria](image) Red Bull Racing (2) |\n| Circuit length | 6.174\u00a0km (3.836\u00a0miles) |\n| Race length | 308.450\u00a0km (191.662\u00a0miles) |\n| Laps | 50 |\n| Last race (2023) |\n| Pole position |\n| * ![Mexico](image) Sergio P\u00e9rez\n* Red Bull Racing-Honda RBPT\n* 1:28.265\n |\n| Podium |\n| * + **1.** ![Mexico](image) S.

The first Bahrain Grand Prix was won by Michael Schumacher, driving for Ferrari. The following two editions, in 2005 and 2006, were won by Fernando Alonso, racing for Renault, and Felipe Massa won the 2007 and 2008 editions of the race for Ferrari. Jenson Button won the 2009 Bahrain Grand Prix driving for Brawn GP, and Fernando Alonso won his third Bahrain Grand Prix in 2010 driving for Ferrari. Following the cancellation of the 2011 Bahrain Grand Prix, Sebastian Vettel and Red Bull won the 2012 and 2013 Grands Prix, followed by Lewis Hamilton and Mercedes winning in 2014 and 2015. Hamilton's teammate Nico Rosberg won in 2016, and Sebastian Vettel won another two editions of the race for Ferrari in 2017 and 2018. Lewis Hamilton then proceeded to win the following three Grands Prix, in 2019, 2020, and 2021, setting the record for the most Bahrain Grand Prix wins, with five. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe **Bahrain Grand Prix** (Arabic: \u062c\u0627\u0626\u0632\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u062d\u0631\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0628\u0631\u0649), officially known as the **Gulf Air Bahrain Grand Prix** for sponsorship reasons, is a Formula One motor racing event in Bahrain.[1] The first race took place at the Bahrain International Circuit on 4 April 2004. It made history as the first Formula One Grand Prix to be held in the Middle East, and was given the award for the \"Best Organised Grand Prix\" by the FIA.[2] The race has in the past been the third race of the Formula One calendar. However, in the 2006 season, Bahrain swapped places with the traditional opener, the Australian Grand Prix, which was pushed back to avoid a clash with the Commonwealth Games. In 2010, Bahrain staged the opening race of the 2010 season and the cars drove the full 6.299\u00a0km (3.914\u00a0mi) \"Endurance Circuit\" to celebrate F1's 'diamond jubilee'. In 2021, the Bahrain Grand Prix was the season opener again because the 2021 Australian Grand Prix was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
