You can help by adding missing items with reliable sources.\n\nThis is a list of the **fastest animals** in the world, by types of animal.\n\n\n\n\n## Fastest organism[edit]\n\n\nThe peregrine falcon is the fastest bird, and the fastest member of the animal kingdom, with a diving speed of over 300\u00a0km/h (190\u00a0mph).[1] The fastest land animal is the cheetah. Among the fastest animals in the sea is the black marlin, with uncertain and conflicting reports of recorded speeds.[2][3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n**List of animals by speed**\n| Rank\n | Animal\n | Maximum speed\n | Class\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | Peregrine falcon | 389\u00a0km/h (242\u00a0mph)108\u00a0m/s (354\u00a0ft/s)[1][7] | Flight-diving\n | The peregrine falcon is the fastest aerial animal, fastest animal in flight, fastest bird, and the overall fastest member of the animal kingdom. The peregrine achieves its highest velocity not in horizontal level flight, but during its characteristic hunting stoop (vertical flight). While stooping, the peregrine falcon soars to a great height, then dives steeply at speeds of over 320\u00a0km/h (200\u00a0mph).[1]Assuming the maximum size at 58\u00a0cm, its relative speed clocks at 186 body lengths per second during its hunting swoop, the equivalent of a human running at 170\u00a0m/s (560\u00a0ft/s).\n |\n| 2\n | Golden eagle | 240\u2013320\u00a0km/h (150\u2013200\u00a0mph)67\u201389\u00a0m/s (220\u2013293\u00a0ft/s)[8] | Flight-diving\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Eland | 55\u201370\u00a0km/h (34\u201343\u00a0mph)[62] | Estimated by observing the odometer when an animal ran at its maximum speed, alongside a vehicle on a road.\n |\n| Coyote | 60\u201365\u00a0km/h (37\u201340\u00a0mph)[m] | Coyotes can easily reach 48\u00a0km/h (30\u00a0mph), and can sprint at 65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph) when hunting.[95] Even without a front foot, a coyote can still run at around 32\u00a0km/h (20\u00a0mph).[94] |\n| Big brown bat(flight) | 56\u201364\u00a0km/h (35\u201340\u00a0mph)\n | Big brown bats are reported to be one of the fastest bats reaching speeds of up to 40\u00a0mph.[97] |\n| Common dolphin(swimming) | 55\u201364\u00a0km/h (34\u201340\u00a0mph)[n] | Common dolphins are the fastest marine mammals. When reaching their top speed, they take very short breaths. As an example, fin whales, which are much larger, can empty and refill their lungs in 2 seconds\n |\n| Tiger | 56\u201364\u00a0km/h (35\u201340\u00a0mph)[o] | Tigers live in jungles, and have been recorded going anywhere from 30\u00a0mph (48\u00a0km/h) to 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h); much like the cheetah and lion, however, they only maintain this for a short burst.\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | Grey-headed albatross | 127\u00a0km/h (79\u00a0mph)[16][17][note 1] | Flight\n |  |\n| 11\n | Cheetah | 109.4\u2013120.7\u00a0km/h (68.0\u201375.0\u00a0mph)[a] | Land\n | Fastest land-animal, fastest feline, the cheetah can accelerate from 0 to 96.6\u00a0km/h (60.0\u00a0mph) in under three seconds, though endurance is limited.[18] |\n| 12\n | Sailfish | 109.19\u00a0km/h (67.85\u00a0mph)[*citation needed*] | Flight-swimming\n |  |\n| 13\n | Anna's hummingbird | 98.27\u00a0km/h (61.06\u00a0mph)[24] | Flight\n |  |\n| 14\n | Swordfish | 97\u00a0km/h (60\u00a0mph)[*citation needed*] | Swimming\n |  |\n| 15\n | Ostrich | 90\u00a0km/h (56\u00a0mph)[25] | Land\n |  |\n| 16\n | Pronghorn | 88.5\u00a0km/h (55.0\u00a0mph)[b] | Land\n |  |\n| 17\n | Springbok | 88\u00a0km/h (55\u00a0mph)[30][31] | Land\n |  |\n| 18\n | Quarter Horse | 88.5\u00a0km/h (55.0\u00a0mph)\n | Land\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
