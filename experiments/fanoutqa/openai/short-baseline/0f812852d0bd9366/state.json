It was presented to the creators of the best performance in this genre field, which includes traditional Northern American (or *regional roots*) musical styles such as cajun, zydeco, polka and others.\nAnother new category is the Best Roots Gospel Album in the Gospel genre field, for gospel albums in the aforementioned musical styles, including traditional southern Gospel music.\n\n\n\n* Changes in the Gospel categories\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Dave Grohl \u2013 introduced Beck and Chris Martin\n* Jamie Foxx and Stevie Wonder presented Record of the Year\n* Gwyneth Paltrow \u2013 introduced Beyonc\u00e9[17]\n\n## Winners and nominees[edit]\n\n\nThe eligibility period for the 57th Annual Grammy Awards was October 1, 2013, to September 30, 2014.[18] The nominees were announced on December 5, 2014. The Album of the Year nominees were announced during *A Very Grammy Christmas*, which was broadcast on the same day.[19]\n\n\n\n### General[edit]\n\n\n**Record of the Year**\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSam Smith won four awards, including Best New Artist, Record of the Year, Song of the Year for \"Stay with Me\" and Best Pop Vocal Album for *In the Lonely Hour*. Beck's album *Morning Phase* was named Album of the Year. This prompted Kanye West, who later said he thought Beyonc\u00e9 should have won, to jokingly leap onstage to interrupt Beck in a re-enactment of his 2009 MTV VMA scandal, but West left the stage without saying anything.[4] Both Pharrell Williams and Beyonc\u00e9 took three honors; with her wins, Beyonc\u00e9 became the second-most-honored female musician in Grammy history following Alison Krauss. Lifetime Achievement awards were given to the Bee Gees, George Harrison, Pierre Boulez, Buddy Guy, and Flaco Jim\u00e9nez.[5]\n\n\nIn all, 83 Grammy Awards were presented, one more than in 2014.[6]\n\n\nThe show aired simultaneously on Fox8 in Australia,[7] Sky TV in New Zealand,[8] and on Channel O in South Africa.[9]\n\n\n\n\n## Pre-telecast ceremony[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* ***20 Feet from Stardom* \u2013 Darlene Love, Merry Clayton, Lisa Fischer and Judith Hill**\n\t+ **Morgan Neville, video director; Gil Friesen and Caitrin Rogers, video producers**\n* *On The Run Tour: Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z (TV Program)*\n\t+ Jonas \u00c5kerlund, video director; Ed Burke, Svana Gisla and Dan Parise, video producers\n* *Ghost Stories* \u2013 Coldplay\n\t+ Paul Dugdale, video director; Jim Parsons, video producer\n* \"Metallica Through the Never\" \u2013 Metallica\n\t+ Nimr\u00f3d Antal, video director; Adam Ellison and Charlotte Huggins, video producers\n* *The Truth About Love Tour: Live from Melbourne* \u2013 Pink\n\t+ Larn Poland, video director; Roger Davies, video producer\n\n\n## Special Merit Awards[edit]\n\n\n### MusiCares Person of the Year[edit]\n\n\nMain article: MusiCares Person of the Year\n\n* Bob Dylan\n\n\n### Lifetime Achievement Award[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award\n\n* Bee Gees\n* Pierre Boulez\n* Buddy Guy\n* George Harrison\n* Maria Cordero\n* Flaco Jim\u00e9nez\n* The Louvin Brothers\n* Wayne Shorter\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nGrammy Awards\n |\n| --- |\n| * The Recording Academy\n* Categories\n* Grammy Nominees\n* Records\n* Locations\n* EGOT\n |\n| Special awards | * Legend Award\n* Lifetime Achievement Award\n* Trustees Award\n* Special Merit/Technical Grammy Award\n* Hall of Fame\n* MusiCares Person of the Year\n |\n| Ceremonies | * 1958\n* 1959\n* 1960\n* 1961\n* 1962\n* 1963\n* 1964\n* 1965\n* 1966\n* 1967\n* 1968\n* 1969\n* 1970\n* 1971\n* 1972\n* 1973\n* 1974\n* 1975\n* 1976\n* 1977\n* 1978\n* 1979\n* 1980\n* 1981\n* 1982\n* 1983\n* 1984\n* 1985\n* 1986\n* 1987\n* 1988\n* 1989\n* 1990\n* 1991\n* 1992\n* 1993\n* 1994\n* 1995\n* 1996\n* 1997\n* 1998\n* 1999\n* 2000\n* 2001\n* 2002\n* 2003\n* 2004\n* 2005\n* 2006\n* 2007\n* 2008\n* 2009\n* 2010\n* 2011\n* 2012\n* 2013\n* 2014\n* 2015\n* 2016\n* 2017\n* 2018\n* 2019\n* 2020\n* 2021\n* 2022\n* 2023\n* 2024\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* *G I R L* \u2013 Pharrell Williams\n\t+ Alicia Keys and Justin Timberlake, featured artists; Pharrell Williams, producer; Leslie Brathwaite, Adrian Breakspear, Andrew Coleman, Jimmy Douglas, Hart Gunther, Mick Guzauski, Florian Lagatta, Mike Larson, Stephanie McNally, Alan Meyerson, Ann Mincieli and Kenta Yonesaka, engineers/mixers; Bob Ludwig, mastering engineer\n\n\n**Song of the Year**\n\n\n\n* **\"Stay with Me\" (Darkchild Version)**1\n\t+ **James Napier, William Phillips and Sam Smith, songwriters (Sam Smith)**\n* \"All About That Bass\"\n\t+ Kevin Kadish and Meghan Trainor, songwriters (Meghan Trainor)\n* \"Chandelier\"\n\t+ Sia Furler and Jesse Shatkin, songwriters (Sia)\n* \"Shake It Off\"\n\t+ Max Martin, Shellback and Taylor Swift, songwriters (Taylor Swift)\n* \"Take Me to Church\"\n\t+ Andrew Hozier-Byrne, songwriter (Hozier)\n\n\n**Best New Artist**\n\n\n\n* **Sam Smith**\n* Iggy Azalea\n* Bastille\n* Brandy Clark\n* HAIM\n\n\n### Pop[edit]\n\n\n**Best Pop Solo Performance**\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n | * Fred Hersch\n* John Hiatt\n* J-Roc\n* Keb' Mo'\n* Kevin Kadish\n* Wiz Khalifa\n* Richard King\n* Greg Kurstin\n* Luke Laird\n* Kendrick Lamar\n* Mike Larson\n* Howard Lawrence\n* John Legend\n* Morten Lindberg\n* Kristen Anderson-Lopez\n* Robert Lopez\n* Joe Lovano\n* Mali Music\n\n\n | * Elaine Martone\n* Pete McGuinness\n* MercyMe\n* Edgar Meyer\n* Ann Mincieli\n* Nicki Minaj\n* Ludovic Morlot\n* Jimmy Napes\n* Robbie Nelson\n* Nickel Creek\n* Smokie Norful\n* Partch\n* Katy Perry\n* Tom Petty\n* Steve Price\n* Julian Raymond\n* Rufus Reid\n* Robert Glasper Experiment\n\n\n | * Schoolboy Q\n* Jesse Shatkin\n* Noah \"40\" Shebib\n* Shellback\n* Chris Thile\n* Darrell Thorp\n* Timbaland\n* Justin Timberlake\n* Meghan Trainor\n* Daniil Trifonov\n* Cassidy Turbin\n* Carrie Underwood\n* Keith Urban\n* Joe Visciano\n* Kanye West\n* Charlie Wilson\n* Jesse Winchester\n\n\n |\n\nThe following received multiple awards:\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| *Four:*\n* Sam Smith\n\n*Three:*\n* Beyonc\u00e9\n* Rosanne Cash\n* Bob Ludwig\n* Pharrell Williams\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
