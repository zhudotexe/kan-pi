Its data, published by *Billboard* magazine and compiled by Nielsen SoundScan, is based collectively on each single's weekly physical and digital sales, as well as airplay and streaming. At the end of a year, *Billboard* will publish an annual list of the 100 most successful songs throughout that year on the Hot 100 chart based on the information. For 2022, the list was published on December 1, calculated with data from November 20, 2021 to November 12, 2022.[1] At the number-one position was Glass Animals' \"Heat Waves\", which spent 5 weeks on top of the Billboard Hot 100. It accumulated a total of 91 weeks on the chart, which is the longest-charting song in the 64-year history of the Billboard Hot 100.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | \"Puffin on Zootiez\" | Future |\n| 85\n | \"Like I Love Country Music\" | Kane Brown |\n| 86\n | \"Jingle Bell Rock\" | Bobby Helms |\n| 87\n | \"Ojitos Lindos\" | Bad Bunny and Bomba Est\u00e9reo |\n| 88\n | \"Trouble with a Heartbreak\" | Jason Aldean |\n| 89\n | \"A Holly Jolly Christmas\" | Burl Ives |\n| 90\n | \"Kiss Me More\" | Doja Cat featuring SZA |\n| 91\n | \"She Likes It\" | Russell Dickerson featuring Jake Scott |\n| 92\n | \"Never Say Never\" | Cole Swindell and Lainey Wilson |\n| 93\n | \"Damn Strait\" | Scotty McCreery |\n| 94\n | \"She's All I Wanna Be\" | Tate McRae |\n| 95\n | \"Last Night Lonely\" | Jon Pardi |\n| 96\n | \"Flower Shops\" | Ernest featuring Morgan Wallen |\n| 97\n | \"To the Moon\" | Jnr Choi and Sam Tompkins\n |\n| 98\n | \"Unholy\" | Sam Smith and Kim Petras |\n| 99\n | \"One Mississippi\" | Kane Brown |\n| 100\n | \"Circles Around This Town\" | Maren Morris |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* 2022 in American music\n* List of Billboard Hot 100 number ones of 2022\n* List of Billboard Hot 100 top-ten singles in 2022\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Three songs from Justin Bieber appear on the list, with \"Stay\" (with the Kid Laroi) at number 3, \"Ghost\" at number 8, and \"Essence\" (with Wizkid and Tems) at number 64.\n![](image)Bad Bunny *(pictured)* has seven songs from his fourth solo studio album *Un Verano Sin Ti* on the Year-End list, tying Doja Cat for the most songs of any artist on the list.
