          "content": "<document>\n<title>Genetic code</title>\n<fragment>\n\nThe codons specify which amino acid will be added next during protein biosynthesis. With some exceptions,[1] a three-nucleotide codon in a nucleic acid sequence specifies a single amino acid. The vast majority of genes are encoded with a single scheme (see the RNA codon table). That scheme is often referred to as the canonical or standard genetic code, or simply *the* genetic code, though variant codes (such as in mitochondria) exist.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The genetic codeFurther information: Adaptor hypothesis\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMarshall Nirenberg and Heinrich J. Matthaei were the first to reveal the nature of a codon in 1961.[12] They used a cell-free system to translate a poly-uracil RNA sequence (i.e., UUUUU...) and discovered that the polypeptide that they had synthesized consisted of only the amino acid phenylalanine.[13] They thereby deduced that the codon UUU specified the amino acid phenylalanine.\n\n\nThis was followed by experiments in Severo Ochoa's laboratory that demonstrated that the poly-adenine RNA sequence (AAAAA...) coded for the polypeptide poly-lysine[14] and that the poly-cytosine RNA sequence (CCCCC...) coded for the polypeptide poly-proline.[15] Therefore, the codon AAA specified the amino acid lysine, and the codon CCC specified the amino acid proline. Using various copolymers most of the remaining codons were then determined.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn some proteins, non-standard amino acids are substituted for standard stop codons, depending on associated signal sequences in the messenger RNA. For example, UGA can code for selenocysteine and UAG can code for pyrrolysine. Selenocysteine came to be seen as the 21st amino acid, and pyrrolysine as the 22nd.[55] Unlike selenocysteine, pyrrolysine-encoded UAG is translated with the participation of a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase.[56] Both selenocysteine and pyrrolysine may be present in the same organism.[55] Although the genetic code is normally fixed in an organism, the achaeal prokaryote *Acetohalobium arabaticum* can expand its genetic code from 20 to 21 amino acids (by including pyrrolysine) under different conditions of growth.[57]\n\n\n\n### Variations[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of genetic codes\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| AUG | M | 1.00 | 22.0 | 896,005 | ACG | T | 0.11 | 6.1 | 246,105 | AAG | K | 0.57 | 31.9 | 1,295,568 | AGG | R | 0.21 | 12.0 | 486,463\n |\n| GUU | V | 0.18 | 11.0 | 448,607 | GCU | A | 0.27 | 18.4 | 750,096 | GAU | D | 0.46 | 21.8 | 885,429 | GGU | G | 0.16 | 10.8 | 437,126\n |\n| GUC | V | 0.24 | 14.5 | 588,138 | GCC | A | 0.40 | 27.7 | 1,127,679 | GAC | D | 0.54 | 25.1 | 1,020,595 | GGC | G | 0.34 | 22.2 | 903,565\n |\n| GUA | V | 0.12 | 7.1 | 287,712 | GCA | A | 0.23 | 15.8 | 643,471 | GAA | E | 0.42 | 29.0 | 1,177,632 | GGA | G | 0.25 | 16.5 | 669,873\n |\n| GUG | V | 0.46 | 28.1 | 1,143,534 | GCG | A | 0.11 | 7.4 | 299,495 | GAG | E | 0.58 | 39.6 | 1,609,975 | GGG | G | 0.25 | 16.5 | 669,768\n |\n\n |\n\n## Alternative genetic codes[edit]\n\n\nSee also: DNA and RNA codon tables \u00a7\u00a0Alternative codons\n\n### Non-standard amino acids[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSince 2001, 40 non-natural amino acids have been added into proteins by creating a unique codon (recoding) and a corresponding transfer-RNA:aminoacyl\u00a0\u2013 tRNA-synthetase pair to encode it with diverse physicochemical and biological properties in order to be used as a tool to exploring protein structure and function or to create novel or enhanced proteins.[22][23]\n\n\nH. Murakami and M. Sisido extended some codons to have four and five bases. Steven A. Benner constructed a functional 65th (*in vivo*) codon.[24]\n\n\nIn 2015 N. Budisa, D. S\u00f6ll and co-workers reported the full substitution of all 20,899 tryptophan residues (UGG codons) with unnatural thienopyrrole-alanine in the genetic code of the bacterium *Escherichia coli*.[25]\n\n\nIn 2016 the first stable semisynthetic organism was created. It was a (single cell) bacterium with two synthetic bases (called X and Y). The bases survived cell division.[26][27]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFor example, the amino acid leucine is specified by **Y**U**R** or CU**N** (UUA, UUG, CUU, CUC, CUA, or CUG) codons (difference in the first or third position indicated using IUPAC notation), while the amino acid serine is specified by UC**N** or AG**Y** (UCA, UCG, UCC, UCU, AGU, or AGC) codons (difference in the first, second, or third position).[49] A practical consequence of redundancy is that errors in the third position of the triplet codon cause only a silent mutation or an error that would not affect the protein because the hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity is maintained by equivalent substitution of amino acids; for example, a codon of NUN (where N = any nucleotide) tends to code for hydrophobic amino acids. NCN yields amino acid residues that are small in size and moderate in hydropathicity; NAN encodes average size hydrophilic residues. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAmino acids that share the same biosynthetic pathway tend to have the same first base in their codons. This could be an evolutionary relic of an early, simpler genetic code with fewer amino acids that later evolved to code a larger set of amino acids.[84] It could also reflect steric and chemical properties that had another effect on the codon during its evolution. Amino acids with similar physical properties also tend to have similar codons,[85][86] reducing the problems caused by point mutations and mistranslations.[83]\n\n\nGiven the non-random genetic triplet coding scheme, a tenable hypothesis for the origin of genetic code could address multiple aspects of the codon table, such as absence of codons for D-amino acids, secondary codon patterns for some amino acids, confinement of synonymous positions to third position, the small set of only 20 amino acids (instead of a number approaching 64), and the relation of stop codon patterns to amino acid coding patterns.[87]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Turanov AA, Lobanov AV, Fomenko DE, Morrison HG, Sogin ML, Klobutcher LA, Hatfield DL, Gladyshev VN (January 2009). \"Genetic code supports targeted insertion of two amino acids by one codon\". *Science*. **323** (5911): 259\u201361. doi:10.1126/science.1164748.

Consequently, only a subset of the amino acids used in protein synthesis are essential nutrients.\n\n\n\n## From intermediates of the citric acid cycle and other pathways[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSix other amino acids are considered **conditionally essential** in the human diet, meaning their synthesis can be limited under special pathophysiological conditions, such as prematurity in the infant or individuals in severe catabolic distress.[2] These six are arginine, cysteine, glycine, glutamine, proline, and tyrosine. Six amino acids are non-essential (**dispensable**) in humans, meaning they can be synthesized in sufficient quantities in the body. These six are alanine, aspartic acid, asparagine, glutamic acid, serine,[2] and selenocysteine (considered the 21st amino acid). Pyrrolysine (considered the 22nd amino acid),[3] which is proteinogenic only in certain microorganisms, is not used by and therefore non-essential for most organisms, including humans.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOf the twenty amino acids common to all life forms (not counting selenocysteine), humans cannot synthesize nine: histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan and valine. Additionally, the amino acids arginine, cysteine, glutamine, glycine, proline and tyrosine are considered **conditionally essential**,[5] which means that specific populations who do not synthesize it in adequate amounts, such as new born infants and people with diseased livers who are unable to synthesize cysteine, must obtain one or more of these conditionally essential amino acids from their diet.[6][7] For example, enough arginine is synthesized by the urea cycle to meet the needs of an adult but perhaps not those of a growing child. Amino acids that must be obtained from the diet are called **essential amino acids**. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNonessential amino acids are produced in the body. The pathways for the synthesis of nonessential amino acids come from basic metabolic pathways. Glutamate dehydrogenase catalyzes the reductive amination of \u03b1-ketoglutarate to glutamate. A transamination reaction takes place in the synthesis of most amino acids. At this step, the chirality of the amino acid is established. Alanine and aspartate are synthesized by the transamination of pyruvate and oxaloacetate, respectively. Glutamine is synthesized from NH4+ and glutamate, and asparagine is synthesized similarly. Proline and arginine are both derived from glutamate. Serine, formed from 3-phosphoglycerate, which comes from glycolysis, is the precursor of glycine and cysteine. Tyrosine is synthesized by the hydroxylation of phenylalanine, which is an essential amino acid.\n\n\n\n## Recommended daily intake[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Protein (nutrient)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nEncoded (proteinogenic) amino acids\n |\n| --- |\n| General topics | * Protein\n* Peptide\n* Genetic code\n | ![](image)\n |\n| By properties | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Aliphatic | * Branched-chain amino acids (Valine\n* Isoleucine\n* Leucine)\n* Methionine\n* Alanine\n* Proline\n* Glycine\n |\n| Aromatic | * Histidine\n* Tyrosine\n* Tryptophan\n* Phenylalanine\n |\n| Polar, uncharged | * Asparagine\n* Glutamine\n* Serine\n* Threonine\n |\n| Positive charge (p*K*a) | * Lysine (\u224810.8)\n* Arginine (\u224812.5)\n* Histidine (\u22486.1)\n* Pyrrolysine\n |\n| Negative charge (p*K*a) | * Aspartic acid (\u22483.9)\n* Glutamic acid (\u22484.1)\n* Selenocysteine (\u22485.4)\n* Cysteine (\u22488.3)\n* Tyrosine (\u224810.1)\n |\n\n |\n| * **Amino acids types**: Encoded (proteins)\n* Essential\n* Non-proteinogenic\n* Ketogenic\n* Glucogenic\n* Secondary amino\n* Imino acids\n* D-amino acids\n* Dehydroamino acids\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n6. **^** F\u00fcrst P, Stehle P (1 June 2004). \"What are the essential elements needed for the determination of amino acid requirements in humans?\". *J.

The sulfur-containing amino acids, methionine and homocysteine, can be converted into each other but neither can be synthesized *de novo* in humans. Likewise, cysteine can be made from homocysteine but cannot be synthesized on its own. So, for convenience, sulfur-containing amino acids are sometimes considered a single pool of nutritionally equivalent amino acids as are the aromatic amino acid pair, phenylalanine and tyrosine. Likewise arginine, ornithine, and citrulline, which are interconvertible by the urea cycle, are considered a single group.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Effects of deficiency[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Protein-energy malnutrition\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nEstimating the daily requirement for the indispensable amino acids has proven to be difficult; these numbers have undergone considerable revision over the last 20 years.

Of the 21 amino acids common to all life forms, the nine amino acids humans cannot synthesize are valine, isoleucine, leucine, methionine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, threonine, histidine, and lysine.[1][2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nScientists had known since the early 20th century that rats could not survive on a diet whose only protein source was zein, which comes from maize (corn), but recovered if they were fed casein from cow's milk. This led William Cumming Rose to the discovery of the essential amino acid threonine.[24] Through manipulation of rodent diets, Rose was able to show that ten amino acids are essential for rats: lysine, tryptophan, histidine, phenylalanine, leucine, isoleucine, methionine, valine, and arginine, in addition to threonine. Rose's later work showed that eight amino acids are essential for adult human beings, with histidine also being essential for infants. Longer-term studies established histidine as also essential for adult humans.[25]\n\n\n\n## Interchangeability[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
