The trio were early employees of PayPal, which left them enriched after the company was bought by eBay.[14] Hurley had studied design at the Indiana University of Pennsylvania, and Chen and Karim studied computer science together at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.[15]\n\n\nAccording to a story that has often been repeated in the media, Hurley and Chen developed the idea for YouTube during the early months of 2005, after they had experienced difficulty sharing videos that had been shot at a dinner party at Chen's apartment in San Francisco. Karim did not attend the party and denied that it had occurred, but Chen remarked that the idea that YouTube was founded after a dinner party \"was probably very strengthened by marketing ideas around creating a story that was very digestible\".[16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n13. **^** \"YouTube Revenue and Usage Statistics (2023)\". *Business of Apps*.

Accessible worldwide,[7] it was launched on February 14, 2005, by Steve Chen, Chad Hurley, and Jawed Karim. It is owned by Google and is the second most visited website in the world, after Google Search. YouTube has more than 2.5 billion monthly users,[8] who collectively watch more than one billion hours of videos every day.[9] As of May 2019[update], videos were being uploaded to the platform at a rate of more than 500 hours of content per minute.[10][11]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nYouTube began as a venture capital\u2013funded technology startup. Between November 2005 and April 2006, the company raised money from various investors, with Sequoia Capital and Artis Capital Management being the largest two.[14][21] YouTube's early headquarters were situated above a pizzeria and a Japanese restaurant in San Mateo, California.[22] In February 2005, the company activated `www.youtube.com`.[23] The first video was uploaded on April 23, 2005. Titled \"Me at the zoo\", it shows co-founder Jawed Karim at the San Diego Zoo and can still be viewed on the site.[24][25] In May, the company launched a public beta and by November, a Nike ad featuring Ronaldinho became the first video to reach one million total views.[26][27] The site launched officially on December 15, 2005, by which time the site was receiving 8\u00a0million views a day.[28][29] Clips at the time were limited to 100 megabytes, as little as 30 seconds of footage.[30]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n35. **^** Higgens, Bill (October 5, 2017). \"Hollywood Flashback: 'SNL's' 'Lazy Sunday' Put YouTube on the Map in 2005\". *The Hollywood Reporter*.

Users of ad blockers may be given a pop-up warning saying \"Video player will be blocked after 3 videos\". Users of ad blockers are shown a message inviting them to subscribe to YouTube Premium. YouTube says that the use of ad blockers violates its terms of service.[96][97]\n\n\n\n## Senior leadership[edit]\n\n\nYouTube has been led by a CEO since its founding in 2005, beginning with Chad Hurley, who led the company until 2010. After Google's acquisition of YouTube, the CEO role was retained. Salar Kamangar took over Hurley's position and held the job until 2014. He was replaced by Susan Wojcicki, who later resigned in 2023.[95] The current CEO is Neal Mohan, who was appointed on February 16, 2023.[95]\n\n\n\n## Features[edit]\n\n\n### Video technology[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn October 2006, YouTube was bought by Google for $1.65\u00a0billion.[12] Google's ownership of YouTube expanded the site's business model, expanding from generating revenue from advertisements alone to offering paid content such as movies and exclusive content produced by YouTube. It also offers YouTube Premium, a paid subscription option for watching content without ads. YouTube also approved creators to participate in Google's AdSense program, which seeks to generate more revenue for both parties. In 2021, YouTube's annual advertising revenue increased to $28.8 billion, an increase in revenue of $9 billion from the previous year.[1] YouTube reported revenue of $29.2 billion in 2022.[13]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n56. **^** \"Hurley stepping down as YouTube chief executive\".

Chen received 625,366 shares of Google and an additional 68,721 in a trust as part of the sale.
