In addition to maintaining its pedigree registry, this kennel club also promotes and sanctions events for purebred dogs, including the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show, an annual event which predates the official forming of the AKC, the National Dog Show and the AKC National Championship. The AKC is a non-member partner with the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale.[1] The AKC recognizes 200 dog breeds, as of 2022.[update]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 1884, a group of 13 breed clubs, 10 American clubs and three Canadian clubs founded the American Kennel Club.[2] These 13 clubs pledged \"to do everything to advance the study, breeding, exhibiting, running and maintenance of purity of thoroughbred dogs.\"[3] The AKC differed from The Kennel Club in that individuals could not directly join the AKC; they became members of smaller, individual breed clubs, which were themselves members of the AKC.[2] When arguments began to develop between the American and Canadian breed clubs in 1886, the Canadian clubs pulled out from the organization and established their own kennel club two years later, the Canadian Kennel Club.[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n27. **^** \"Newsday | Long Island's & NYC's News Source\". *Newsday*.\n28. **^** \"AKC Fails to Take a Stand Against Puppy Mills\". *humanesociety.org*.

If the dog's parents are not registered with the AKC or the litter is not registered, an exception may be made if the AKC determines, through special registry research, that the dog is eligible for AKC registration. Once a determination of eligibility is met, either by litter application or registry research, the dog can be registered as purebred by the AKC.[5] Registration indicates only that the dog's parents were registered as one recognized breed; it does not necessarily indicate that the dog comes from healthy or show-quality bloodlines, nor is registration necessarily a reflection on the quality of the breeder or how the puppy was raised.[6][7]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1894, the American Kennel Club began to refuse to allow Canadian dogs without an American pedigree to participate in its shows, following the prevailing trends in American purebred cattle organizations.[2] In 1906, the U.S. Department of Agriculture ruled that any dogs imported to America who were not registered with the AKC would have to pay a duty charge; this was later changed in 1911, allowing any dog registered with a kennel club in its home country duty-free entry into the country.[2] Soon after the AKC, CKC, and KC produced agreements that made any dog eligible to be registered with the club in its home country, eligible for registration in the remaining two clubs as well.[2] In 1909, the group moved to New York and became incorporated.[2]\n\n\nOn July 1, 2012, the AKC began to recognize certain titles issued by the North American Flyball Association. These titles are Flyball Champion (FDCh), Flyball Master (FM), and the ONYX title.[4]\n\n\n\n## Registration[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the early 1800s, the English became concerned with the beauty of dogs as well as their function.[2] This fad spread to North America, and in 1877, the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show began.[2] Soon after, the need for a regulating body became obvious. The National American Kennel Club, which had been founded in 1876, began to publish and make publicly available its studbook in 1879.[2] This organization, however, had more vested interest in field trials than in conformation shows, and eventually changed its name to the National Field Trial Association and stopped hosting conformation shows completely.[2]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n7. **^** Pilon, Mary; Craig, Susanne (February 9, 2013). \"Safety Concerns Stoke Criticism of Kennel Club\". *The New York Times*.

This particular dog is a multi-titled champion of agility, herding, and obedience.\n### Competition[edit]\n\n\nThe AKC sanctions events in which dogs and handlers can compete.\n\n\n\nConformation shows\nIn AKC conformation shows dogs compete in different classes based on breed and sex, with breeds divided into hound, terrier, working, herding, sporting, non-sporting, toy and miscellaneous groups.[9] The AKC's premier conformation shows are the Westminster Dog Show and the AKC National Championship.[10]\n\n\n\nDog agility\nThe AKC organises dog agility competitions open to all AKC registered dogs over 12-months age.[11]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* **Cavalier King Charles Spaniel:** The Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Club voted to reject AKC recognition in May 2000 due to the incompatibility of the breed club's no-sales-to-pet-stores rule, while the AKC required such sales.[3] The breed club had such a rule to aid in the genetic health of the breed.[3][32]\n* **Jack Russell Terrier:** In the 1990s, some breeders of Jack Russell Terriers wanted to be included in the AKC, but the Jack Russell Terrier Club of America (JRTCA) opposed the idea on the grounds that the working abilities of the JRT would be compromised by turning it into a show dog with an association dedicated to providing awards and championship status to individual dogs based solely on their conformation. The AKC did accept the JRT into the registry but under the new name Parson Russell Terrier to distinguish the AKC dogs from the JRT working dogs.[33][*self-published source?*]\n\n\n### Lobbying[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nNational kennel clubs\n |\n| --- |\n| * American Kennel Club\n* Australian National Kennel Council\n* Canadian Kennel Club\n* Confedera\u00e7\u00e3o Brasileira de Cinofilia\n* Cynological Federation of Georgia\n* Dutch Kennel Club\n* East Africa Kennel Club\n* Ente Nazionale della Cinofilia Italiana\n* Indian National Kennel Club\n* Irish Kennel Club\n* Japan Kennel Club\n* Kennel Club of India\n* Kennel Club of Montenegro\n* Kennel Club of Pakistan\n* Kennel Union of Southern Africa\n* Malaysian Kennel Association\n* New Zealand Kennel Club\n* Polish Kennel Club\n* Real Sociedad Canina en Espa\u00f1a\n* Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Centrale Canine\n* Suomen Kennelliitto\n* Svenska Kennelklubben\n* The Kennel Club (United Kingdom)\n* Verband f\u00fcr das Deutsche Hundewesen\n |\n| Kennel club \u2022 F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale\n |\n\n| Authority control databases ![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\n |\n| --- |\n| International | * ISNI\n* VIAF\n |\n| National | * Germany\n* Israel\n* United States\n |\n| Other | * IdRef\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe AKC has lobbied dog-related bills.

These figures show that between 1905 and 1935, the Siberian Husky was consistently in either first or second place. Malteses were the most popular dog from 1936 all the way through to 1952, when the Beagle became the number one dog until 1959. Poodles would become the most popular breed for the longest, reigning from 1960 for the next twenty-two years until 1982, when the American Maltese once again took over until 1990. The Labrador Retriever has been the most popular since 1991.[1]\n\n\n\n## Club registration figures for 2006[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Position\n | Breed\n | Registrations\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | Labrador Retriever | 45,700\n |\n| 2\n | English Cocker Spaniel | 20,459\n |\n| 3\n | English Springer Spaniel | 15,133\n |\n| 4\n | German Shepherd | 12,857\n |\n| 5\n | Staffordshire Bull Terrier | 12,729\n |\n| 6\n | Cavalier King Charles Spaniel | 11,411\n |\n| 7\n | Golden Retriever | 9,373\n |\n| 8\n | West Highland White Terrier | 9,300\n |\n| 9\n | Boxer | 9,066\n |\n| 10\n | Border Terrier | 8,916\n |\n\n* *11-20 (in descending order): Rottweiler, Shih Tzu, Miniature Schnauzer, Lhasa Apso, Yorkshire Terrier, Bulldog, Dobermann Pinscher, Bull Terrier, Weimaraner, Pug.*\n* *21-30 (in descending order): Whippet, Dogue de Bordeaux (Imp), Bichon Frise, Border Collie, Siberian Husky, Shar-Pei, Dalmatian, Great Dane, Cairn Terrier, Beagle.*\n | American Kennel Club (2006)[3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* *11-20 (in descending order): Shih Tzu, Miniature Schnauzer, Lhasa Apso, Bulldog, Pug, Yorkshire Terrier, Whippet, Bull Terrier, Bichon Frise, Rottweiler.*\n | American Kennel Club (2008)[3]\n\n\n| Position\n | Breed\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1\n | Labrador Retriever |\n| 2\n | Yorkshire Terrier |\n| 3\n | German Shepherd |\n| 4\n | Golden Retriever |\n| 5\n | Beagle |\n| 6\n | Boxer |\n| 7\n | Dachshund |\n| 8\n | English Bulldog |\n| 9\n | Poodle |\n| 10\n | Shih Tzu |\n\n* *11-20 (in descending order): Miniature Schnauzer, Chihuahua, Pomeranian, Rottweiler, Pug, German Shorthaired Pointer, Boston Terrier, Doberman Pinscher, Shetland Sheepdog, Maltese*\n* *21-30 (in descending order): American Cocker Spaniel, Great Dane, Siberian Husky, Pembroke Welsh Corgi, Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, French Bulldog, English Springer Spaniel, English Mastiff, Australian Shepherd, Brittany*\n\n\n |\n\nCanadian Kennel Club (2008)[7]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n9. **^** *Registration figures worldwide \u2013 from top thirty to endangered breeds.* In: FCI: *Newsletter 3/2013.
