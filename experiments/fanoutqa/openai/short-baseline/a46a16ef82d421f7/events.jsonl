It is Europe's fourth-smallest country, with an area of just over 160 square kilometres (62 square miles) and a population of 38,749 (as of 2019[update]).[15] Divided into 11 municipalities, its capital is Vaduz, and its largest municipality is Schaan. It is also the smallest country to border two countries.[16]\n\n\nEconomically, Liechtenstein has one of the highest gross domestic products per person in the world when adjusted for purchasing power parity.[17] The country has a strong financial sector centred in Vaduz. It was once known as a billionaire tax haven, but is no longer on any official blacklists of uncooperative tax haven countries. An Alpine country, Liechtenstein is mountainous, making it a winter sport destination.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n22. **^** Klieger, P.

It is Europe's fourth-smallest country, with an area of just over 160 square kilometres (62 square miles) and a population of 38,749 (as of 2019[update]).[15] Divided into 11 municipalities, its capital is Vaduz, and its largest municipality is Schaan. It is also the smallest country to border two countries.[16]\n\n\nEconomically, Liechtenstein has one of the highest gross domestic products per person in the world when adjusted for purchasing power parity.[17] The country has a strong financial sector centred in Vaduz. It was once known as a billionaire tax haven, but is no longer on any official blacklists of uncooperative tax haven countries. An Alpine country, Liechtenstein is mountainous, making it a winter sport destination.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n22. **^** Klieger, P.
