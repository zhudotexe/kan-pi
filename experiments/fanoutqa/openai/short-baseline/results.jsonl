Herschel initially reported it as a comet, but further observations confirmed it as a new planet.

Discrepancies in the orbit of Uranus led Alexis Bouvard to hypothesize the existence of another planet.

Rank the countries based on their GDP per capita and identify the top five.\n\nLet's start by identifying the countries with a head of state who assumed office before 2000.\n\nHere are the countries with heads of state who assumed office prior to 2000:\n\n1. **Brunei** - Hassanal Bolkiah (since 1967)\n2. **Denmark** - Margrethe II (since 1972)\n3. **Sweden** - Carl XVI Gustaf (since 1973)\n4. **Cameroon** - Paul Biya (since 1975)\n5. **Equatorial Guinea** - Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo (since 1979)\n6. **Iran** - Ali Khamenei (since 1981)\n7. **Eritrea** - Isaias Afwerki (since 1991)\n8. **Tajikistan** - Emomali Rahmon (since 1992)\n9. **Belarus** - Alexander Lukashenko (since 1994)\n10. **Lesotho** - Letsie III (since 1996)\n11. **Congo-Brazzaville** - Denis Sassou Nguesso (since 1997)\n12. **Luxembourg** - Henri (since 1998)\n13. **Jordan** - Abdullah II (since 1999)\n\nNext, we need to obtain the latest GDP per capita data for these countries and identify the top five.\n\nIt seems that the searches for GDP per capita data for each country did not yield direct results. However, we can use general knowledge and reliable sources to identify the GDP per capita for these countries. Here are the approximate GDP per capita figures for the countries listed:\n\n1. **Brunei**: Approximately $31,000\n2. **Denmark**: Approximately $60,000\n3. **Sweden**: Approximately $55,000\n4. **Cameroon**: Approximately $1,500\n5. **Equatorial Guinea**: Approximately $8,000\n6. **Iran**: Approximately $5,000\n7. **Eritrea**: Approximately $600\n8. **Tajikistan**: Approximately $800\n9. **Belarus**: Approximately $6,000\n10. **Lesotho**: Approximately $1,200\n11. **Congo-Brazzaville**: Approximately $2,000\n12. **Luxembourg**: Approximately $115,000\n13. **Jordan**: Approximately $4,500\n\nBased on these approximate figures, the five countries with the largest GDP per capita are:\n\n1. **Luxembourg**: $115,000\n2. **Denmark**: $60,000\n3. **Sweden**: $55,000\n4. **Brunei**: $31,000\n5. **Equatorial Guinea**: $8,000\n\nThese figures are approximate and can vary slightly based on the source and the year of the data.", "question": "Of the countries with a head of state assuming office prior to 2000, which are the five with the largest GDP per capita?", "log_dir": "/mnt/nlpgpu-io1/data/andrz/redel/experiments/fanoutqa/test/trial2/short-baseline/c91cb8efeedea700"}

{"id": "46392c4aa1c75391", "answer": "The **Sahara** is the world's largest hot desert, spanning an area of 9,200,000 square kilometers (3,600,000 square miles) across North Africa. It is the third-largest desert overall, following Antarctica and the Arctic. The name \"Sahara\" is derived from the Arabic word for \"desert\" (\u0635\u062d\u0631\u0627\u0621, *\u1e63a\u1e25r\u0101\u02be*).\n\n### Geography\n- **Location**: The Sahara covers much of North Africa, excluding the Mediterranean coast, the Atlas Mountains, and the Nile Valley.\n- **Countries**: Algeria, Chad, Egypt, Libya, Mali, Mauritania, Morocco, Niger, Sudan, Tunisia, and Western Sahara (disputed).\n- **Coordinates**: 23\u00b0N 13\u00b0E.\n- **Dimensions**: Approximately 4,800 km (3,000 mi) in length and 1,800 km (1,100 mi) in width.\n\n### Physical Features\n- **Terrain**: The Sahara is primarily composed of rocky plateaus (hamada), with sand dunes (ergs) forming a smaller part. Other features include gravel plains (reg), dry valleys (wadis), and salt flats (shatt or chott).\n- **Mountains**: Includes volcanic and non-volcanic ranges such as the A\u00efr Mountains, Ahaggar Mountains, Saharan Atlas, Tibesti Mountains, and the Red Sea Hills. The highest peak is Emi Koussi in Chad.\n\n### Climate\n- **Conditions**: The Sahara is located in the horse latitudes under the subtropical ridge, characterized by high pressure, descending air, and minimal cloud formation. This results in extremely arid conditions with minimal and sporadic rainfall.\n\n### Flora and Fauna\n- **Plants**: The central Sahara has around 500 species of plants, including acacia trees, palms, succulents, and grasses. These plants have adapted to arid conditions through various means such as water storage and reduced leaf size.\n- **Animals**: Common animals include dromedary camels, goats, monitor lizards, sand vipers, and small populations of African wild dogs and red-necked ostriches. Unique species include the Saharan silver ant and the deathstalker scorpion.\n\n### Human Impact\n- **Activities**: Human activities are concentrated around oases and areas with accessible water. Development projects in Algeria and Tunisia have utilized underground aquifers for irrigation, leading to soil degradation and salinization.\n\n### Ecoregions\n- **Central Sahara**: Hyper-arid with minimal vegetation, consisting mostly of sand dunes, stone plateaus, and gravel plains.\n- **South Saharan Steppe and Woodlands**: A transitional zone with summer rains supporting grasses and dry woodlands.\n- **Atlantic Coastal Desert**: A narrow strip along the Atlantic coast with fog-sustained vegetation.\n- **North Saharan Steppe and Woodlands**: A transition zone between the Mediterranean climate and the hyper-arid Sahara.\n\n### History and Research\n- **Historical Significance**: The Sahara has been a significant region for human history, with ancient trade routes and settlements.\n- **Research**: Studies have shown that Saharan soil may contain bio-available iron and nutrients suitable for agriculture.\n\nThe Sahara remains a region of extreme conditions, unique biodiversity, and significant human and ecological interest.", "question": "Identify the four largest deserts on Earth and the dominant type of animal life found in each.", "log_dir": "/mnt/nlpgpu-io1/data/andrz/redel/experiments/fanoutqa/test/trial2/short-baseline/46392c4aa1c75391"}
