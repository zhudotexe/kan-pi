John Bardeen is the only laureate to win the prize twice\u2014in 1956 and 1972.\n\n\nWilliam Lawrence Bragg was the youngest Nobel laureate in physics; he won the prize in 1915 at the age of 25. He was also the youngest laureate for any Nobel prize until 2014 (when Malala Yousafzai won the Nobel Peace Prize at age 17).[6] The oldest Nobel Prize laureate in physics was Arthur Ashkin who was 96 years old when he was awarded the prize in 2018.[7]\n\n\nOnly five women have won the prize: Marie Curie (1903), Maria Goeppert-Mayer (1963), Donna Strickland (2018), Andrea Ghez (2020), and Anne L'Huillier (2023).[8] Before L'Huillier, each woman only ever received a quarter share of the prize, although Marie Curie did receive an unshared Nobel prize in chemistry in 1911. In 2023 L'Huillier received a one-third share.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n14. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"The Nobel Prize in Physics 1925\". Nobel Foundation.

They isolated graphene, a single layer of carbon atoms, which has exceptional properties and potential applications in various fields including electronics and materials science.\n\n### 2011\n**Saul Perlmutter, Brian P. Schmidt, and Adam G. Riess**  \n**Contribution:** For the discovery of the accelerating expansion of the Universe through observations of distant supernovae. Their work provided evidence for the existence of dark energy, a mysterious force driving the acceleration.\n\n### 2012\n**Serge Haroche and David J. Wineland**  \n**Contribution:** For ground-breaking experimental methods that enable measuring and manipulation of individual quantum systems. Their work has paved the way for the development of quantum computers and precise timekeeping.\n\n### 2013\n**Fran\u00e7ois Englert and Peter Higgs**  \n**Contribution:** For the theoretical discovery of a mechanism that contributes to our understanding of the origin of mass of subatomic particles, and which recently was confirmed through the discovery of the predicted fundamental particle, by the ATLAS and CMS experiments at CERN's Large Hadron Collider.\n\n### 2014\n**Isamu Akasaki, Hiroshi Amano, and Shuji Nakamura**  \n**Contribution:** For the invention of efficient blue light-emitting diodes which has enabled bright and energy-saving white light sources. Their work has revolutionized lighting technology and contributed to energy savings.\n\n### 2015\n**Takaaki Kajita and Arthur B. McDonald**  \n**Contribution:** For the discovery of neutrino oscillations, which shows that neutrinos have mass. This discovery has important implications for our understanding of the fundamental laws of physics and the universe.\n\nThese laureates have made significant contributions to the field of physics, advancing our understanding of the universe and leading to practical applications that benefit society.",
