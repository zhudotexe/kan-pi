The band was nominated for Grammy Awards in three categories: Album of the Year, Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, and Best Alternative Music Album (for *The Suburbs*).[71] Out of the three nominations, they won the Grammy for Album of the Year, their second time to be nominated for the award.[72][73][74]\n\n\nAt the 2011 BRIT Awards, *The Suburbs* won Best International Album, and Arcade Fire won the Award for Best International Group.[75]\n\n\nIn March 2011, Arcade Fire was honoured at the Juno Awards of 2011. They won Group of the Year and Songwriter of the Year for \"Ready to Start\", \"Sprawl II (Mountains Beyond Mountains)\", and \"We Used to Wait\", all off *The Suburbs*. *The Suburbs* also won Album of the Year and Alternative Album of the Year.[76]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n\nAt the 2014 Juno Awards, *Reflektor* won Album of the Year and Alternative Album of the Year. The album was also a shortlisted nominee for the 2014 Polaris Music Prize.[109] In 2015, Arcade Fire was the recipient of the International Achievement Award at the SOCAN Awards held in Montreal.[110]\n\n\nA documentary film about the making of the album, called *The Reflektor Tapes*, was released on September 24, 2015 and was shown at the 2015 Toronto Film Festival.[111] The following day, a deluxe edition of the album containing original recordings and five unreleased songs was released. The documentary was directed by Kahlil Joseph, winner of the 2013 Sundance Grand Jury Prize for Short Films.[112]\n\n\n\n### 2016\u20132019: *Everything Now*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Everything Now\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe album debuted at No. 1 on the Irish Albums Chart, the UK Albums Chart, the US *Billboard* 200 chart,[68] and the Canadian Albums Chart.[69] It won Album of the Year at the 2011 Grammy Awards, Best International Album at the 2011 BRIT Awards, Album of the Year at the 2011 Juno Awards, and the 2011 Polaris Music Prize for best Canadian album. Two weeks after winning Grammy's Album of the Year, the album jumped from No. 52 to No. 12 on the *Billboard* 200, the album's highest ranking since August 2010.[70]\n\n\nIn a nod to the Butlers' maternal grandfather, Alvino Rey, who was an amateur radio operator, the logo used by the band from this time was a variation of that used by the American Radio Relay League. Also, when playing the single \"We Used to Wait\" live, the background video screen features a radio exchange between Rey and a Canadian operator having Call Sign VE3YV. The video also features many other amateur radio artifacts.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Arcade Fire in July 2007\nOn July 10, 2007, *Neon Bible* was named to the shortlist for the 2007 Polaris Music Prize. Patrick Watson was announced as the winner at a gala ceremony on September 24, 2007.[38][39][40] However, due to the band's preference not to participate in compilation albums, they were the only nominee not to have a track on the Polaris promotional compilation 2007 Polaris Music Prize. Some media initially reported that the Polaris committee had snubbed the band by excluding them, leading the band and the committee to issue a joint press release confirming that the band chose not to have a track included on the album.[41]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFounded in 2001 by friends and classmates Butler and Josh Deu, the band came to prominence in 2004 with the release of their critically acclaimed debut album *Funeral*. Their second studio album, *Neon Bible*, won them the 2008 Meteor Music Award for Best International Album and the 2008 Juno Award for Alternative Album of the Year. Their third studio album, *The Suburbs*, was released in 2010 to critical acclaim and commercial success.[2] It received many accolades, including the 2011 Grammy for Album of the Year, the 2011 Juno Award for Album of the Year and the 2011 Brit Award for Best International Album. In 2013, Arcade Fire released their fourth album, *Reflektor*, and scored the feature film *Her*, for which band members Will Butler and Owen Pallett were nominated in the Best Original Score category at the 86th Academy Awards. In 2017, the band released their fifth studio album *Everything Now*, which was succeeded by their sixth studio album *We* in 2022.[3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAll the band's studio albums have received nominations for Best Alternative Music Album at the Grammys. *Funeral* is widely considered by music critics to be one of the greatest albums of the 2000s.[4] The band's work has also been named three times as a shortlist nominee for the Polaris Music Prize: in 2007 for *Neon Bible*, in 2011 for *The Suburbs* and in 2014 for *Reflektor*.\n\n\nThe band has been described as indie rock,[5] art rock,[6] dance-rock,[7][8] and baroque pop.[9] They play guitar, drums, bass guitar, piano, violin, viola, cello, double bass, xylophone, glockenspiel, keyboard, synthesizer, French horn, accordion, harp, mandolin and hurdy-gurdy, and take most of these instruments on tour; the multi-instrumentalist band members switch duties throughout shows.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### 2001\u20132003: Formation and early work[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n74. **^** Estes, Adam Clark (February 13, 2011). \"UPDATED: 2011 Grammys Winners and Losers\". *Salon*.
