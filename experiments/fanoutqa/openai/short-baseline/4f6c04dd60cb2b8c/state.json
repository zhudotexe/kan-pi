Established in 1891 and played since 1928 on outdoor red clay courts at the Stade Roland Garros in Paris, France,[1] the French Open is (since 1925) one of the four Grand Slam tournaments played each year, the other three being the Australian Open, Wimbledon, and the US Open. Organised by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Fran\u00e7aise de Tennis (FFT), the French Open is the second of the four Grand Slam tournaments of the year to be played.[2] In 1968, it was the first Grand Slam tournament to open to non-amateur players.\n\n\nThe winner of the men's singles event receives the Coupe des Mousquetaires, named after The Four Musketeers of French tennis: Jean Borotra, Jacques Brugnon, Henri Cochet, and Ren\u00e9 Lacoste.[3] The event was not held from 1915 to 1919 because of the First World War and was held unofficially as the Tournoi de France under German occupation from 1941 to 1944, during the Second World War.[4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAmerican Jim Courier won consecutive titles in 1991 and 1992 before Spaniard Sergi Bruguera repeated the feat in 1993 and 1994.[22][23] Gustavo Kuerten won three titles in 1997, 2000 and 2001.[19] 2005 marked Rafael Nadal's first French Open; he won four consecutive titles from 2005 to 2008.[24] Nadal was beaten in the round of 16 of the 2009 tournament by Robin S\u00f6derling who lost to Roger Federer in the final.[25] Nadal regained the title in 2010 and defended his crowns in 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014. In the 2015 event, he was knocked out in the quarter-finals by Novak Djokovic, who eventually lost in the final to Stan Wawrinka.[26] Nadal would again win four straight titles from 2017 to 2020.\n\n\n\n## Finals[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n1. **^** \"The Origins of the Tournament\".

The tournament was reserved for members of French tennis clubs until the first edition open to international players took place in 1925.[5] From 1941 to 1944, the tournament took place under Vichy regime, won two times by Alice Weiwers and once by Simone Iribarne Lafargue, and Raymonde Jones Veber. Those editions are not counted by the FFT in the tournament's history, and were retroactively named *Tournoi de France*.[2] In 1945, under the Provisional Government of the French Republic, the champion was Lolette Payot. Even if it was organised by the French Lawn Tennis Federation, the 1945 event is also not counted by the FFT in the tournament's history.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nGrand Slam tournament champions\n |\n| --- |\n| * Grand Slam overall records\n |\n| Australian Open | * Men's singles\n* Women's singles\n* Men's doubles\n* Women's doubles\n* Mixed doubles\n* All disciplines\n |\n| French Open | * Men's singles\n* Women's singles\n* Men's doubles\n* Women's doubles\n* Mixed doubles\n* All disciplines\n |\n| Wimbledon | * Men's singles\n* Women's singles\n* Men's doubles\n* Women's doubles\n* Mixed doubles\n* All disciplines\n |\n| US Open | * Men's singles\n* Women's singles\n* Men's doubles\n* Women's doubles\n* Mixed doubles\n* All disciplines\n |\n| All tournaments | * Men's singles\n* Women's singles\n* Men's doubles\n* Women's doubles\n* Mixed doubles\n* Boys' singles\n* Girls' singles\n* Boys' doubles\n* Girls' doubles\n* Wheelchair men's\n* Wheelchair women's\n* Wheelchair quad\n |\n| * Men's singles finals\n* Women's singles finals\n* Open Era singles finalists\n\t+ Aus Open\n\t+ French Open\n\t+ Wimbledon\n\t+ US Open\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the French International Championships, that came after the tournament opened to international competitors but before the open era, Helen Wills Moody (1928\u20131930, 1932) holds the record for most titles at four.

It was Muster's first of only 2 losses on clay in 1995. Costa ended Muster's streak of 40 consecutive clay match wins and his 11 consecutive final wins . Costa won three further titles in 1996. In 1997, he won another two singles titles and was part of the Spanish team that won the World Team Cup. He won another two singles titles in 1998, including the Tennis Masters Series event in Hamburg and played at magnificent level at the French Open, only a brilliant Marcelo R\u00edos could stop him at fourth round, but he established the bases for his future winning in 2002. Three further titles followed in 1999.\n\n\nIn 2000, Costa helped Spain win its first Davis Cup. Despite being knocked out in the first round in men's singles, he also captured a bronze medal in the men's doubles at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, partnering \u00c1lex Corretja.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nATP Masters 1000 singles champions\n |\n| --- |\n| Champions by year \u2014 Series' finals\n |\n| Indian Wells Open | * Stefan Edberg\n* Jim Courier (2)\n* Michael Chang (2)\n* Pete Sampras (2)\n* Marcelo R\u00edos\n* Mark Philippoussis\n* \u00c0lex Corretja\n* Andre Agassi\n* Lleyton Hewitt (2)\n* Roger Federer (**5**)\n* Rafael Nadal (3)\n* Novak Djokovic (**5**)\n* Ivan Ljubi\u010di\u0107\n* Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro\n* Dominic Thiem\n* Cameron Norrie\n* Taylor Fritz\n* Carlos Alcaraz (2)\n |\n| Miami Open | * Andre Agassi (**6**)\n* Jim Courier\n* Michael Chang\n* Pete Sampras (3)\n* Thomas Muster\n* Marcelo R\u00edos\n* Richard Krajicek\n* Andy Roddick\n* Roger Federer (4)\n* Novak Djokovic (**6**)\n* Nikolay Davydenko\n* Andy Murray (2)\n* Andy Roddick\n* John Isner\n* Hubert Hurkacz\n* Carlos Alcaraz\n* Daniil Medvedev\n* Jannik Sinner\n |\n| Monte-Carlo Masters | * Andrei Chesnokov\n* Sergi Bruguera (2)\n* Thomas Muster (3)\n* Andriy Medvedev\n* Marcelo R\u00edos\n* Carlos Moy\u00e1\n* Gustavo Kuerten (2)\n* C\u00e9dric Pioline\n* Juan Carlos Ferrero (2)\n* Guillermo Coria\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
