Briggs, a member of Club Stade Français which entitled him to compete.[12] Records show matches were played as the best-of-three sets format until 1902 or 1903, when best-of-five sets was adopted.

Nadal won four consecutive titles on two separate occasions from 2005 to 2008 and 2017–2020, and an open era record of five consecutive titles from 2010 to 2014.\nThe French Open was established in 1891 and was originally known as the French Championships.[10] The tournament was only open to French players or foreign players who were a member of a French club during the first 34 years of its existence.[11] The first winner of the Championship was the British player H. Briggs, a member of Club Stade Français which entitled him to compete.[12] Records show matches were played as the best-of-three sets format until 1902 or 1903, when best-of-five sets was adopted. French players were dominant in the early stages of the tournament, in particular Max Decugis, who won eight titles before the outbreak of the First World War.[13]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n26. **^** \"Novak Djokovic beats Andy Murray to win first French Open title\".
