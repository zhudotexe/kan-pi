It is the sixth television series in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) to be produced by Marvel Studios, sharing continuity with the films of the franchise. It follows Marc Spector and Steven Grant, two alters of a man with dissociative identity disorder (DID), as they are drawn into a mystery involving Egyptian gods. Slater serves as head writer with Mohamed Diab leading the directing team.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn August 2019, Marvel Studios announced at the D23 conference that a series based on Moon Knight was being developed for the streaming service Disney+.[52] That November, Jeremy Slater was hired to serve as the head writer and executive producer of the series,[2][53] which consists of six 40\u201350-minute episodes.[54] Egyptian director Mohamed Diab was set to direct four episodes in October 2020,[55][56] as well as executive produce the series. Marvel had approached him \"out of the blue\" to present a pitch for *Moon Knight*,[55] which includes Egyptian mythology and characters that the superhero is associated with in the comics. Diab and his writer-producer wife Sarah Goher put together a 200-page document outlining their vision for the series, which included their intention to depict Egypt and Egyptian people in a more positive way than they felt had been done in previous Hollywood productions. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nCurtis was hopeful the project would continue for other MCU films and series.[138] Viewers who scanned the code were also sent an exclusive, digital poster after the series finale of the \"SPKTR\" license plate.[143]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n*Moon Knight* debuted on Disney+ on March 30, 2022.[144] It consists of six episodes,[54] releasing weekly until May 4.[145] A special screening occurred on March 16 at Cine Capitol in Madrid,[146] and on March 17 at the British Museum in London,[147] with the red carpet premiere on March 22 at El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles.[148][149] It is part of Phase Four of the MCU.[150]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Audience viewership[edit]\n\n\nParrot Analytics, which looks at consumer engagement in consumer research, streaming, downloads, and on social media, reported that *Moon Knight* had the most in-demand United States series premiere in the first quarter of 2022. It had 33.4 times the average demand of all other series in the U.S. during its first 30 days.[151]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n*Moon Knight* premiered on March 30, 2022, and ran for six episodes, concluding on May 4. It is part of Phase Four of the MCU. The series received positive reviews, with particular praise for the performances (particularly those of Isaac, Calamawy and Hawke), the darker tone compared to previous MCU series, and its portrayal of DID.\n\n\n\n\n## Premise[edit]\n\n\nMarc Spector, a mercenary who has dissociative identity disorder (DID), is drawn into a deadly mystery involving Egyptian gods with his multiple alters, such as Steven Grant.[2]\n\n\n\n## Cast and characters[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nA potential spin-off series for the character had also been in development.[46] In October, Marvel Studios partnered with No Equal Entertainment to produce a separate television series featuring Moon Knight.[47] Writer Jon Cooksey was hired to develop the series by 2008, but it did not move forward.[48] James Gunn, the writer and director of Marvel's *Guardians of the Galaxy* films, said in January 2017 that he had discussed a Moon Knight film with Marvel Studios but did not have time to work on it;[49] he later said that he had mentioned the idea in passing to Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige and several others, but did not have a full pitch for such a film as had been reported on from what he initially stated.[50] Feige confirmed in April 2018 that Moon Knight would be introduced to the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), but questioned, \"Does that mean five years from now, 10 years from now, 15 years from now?\"[51]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| *Moon Knight* |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) |\n| Genre | * Action-adventure\n* Fantasy\n* Psychological horror\n* Superhero\n |\n| Created by | Jeremy Slater |\n| Based on | Marvel Comics |\n| Starring | * Oscar Isaac\n* May Calamawy\n* Karim El Hakim\n* F.

Clayton Davis at *Variety* noted that this change could force the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences to reject *Moon Knight* in the limited series categories given their rules and use of past social media and interviews in determining eligibility, necessitating the studios to submit the series in the drama categories,[166] along with *Loki*.[165] Despite this, Davis noted *Moon Knight* was still planned to be submitted in the limited series categories,[166] which Disney and Marvel ultimately did.[167]\n\n\n\n## Documentary special[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *Marvel Studios: Assembled*\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn February 2021, Feige said some of Marvel's series, including *Moon Knight* and *She-Hulk: Attorney at Law*, were being developed with the potential to have additional seasons made, in contrast to series like *WandaVision* (2021), which were developed as limited events that lead into feature films instead.[63] A year later, Isaac referred to *Moon Knight* as a limited series,[11][64] while Diab was unsure whether the series would continue.[65]\n\n\n\n### Writing[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAdditionally, its social engagement of 263,000 mentions were the highest of any Disney+ Marvel series for their first content release.[130] An additional trailer aired during Super Bowl LVI on February 13,[131] which continued to keep the series mysterious while depicting its \"darker sensibilities\", according to *Screen Rant*'s Rachel Labonte.[132] Ben F. Silverio of */Film* said the shots of Moon Knight's cape \"flung out into the shape of a crescent moon\" and the character catching his moon-shaped weapons were the \"coolest\".[133] RelishMix reported the trailer had 9.49\u00a0million views in 24 hours across Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Instagram.[134]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n41. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Newby, Richard (May 4, 2022). \"'Moon Knight' Series' Grand Storytelling Required More Than Six Episodes\". *The Hollywood Reporter*.
