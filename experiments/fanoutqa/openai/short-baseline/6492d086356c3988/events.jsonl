Rowling states that she was born on 19 September 1979[2] and she was nearly twelve when she first attended Hogwarts.[5] She is an overachiever who excels academically and is described by Rowling as a \"very logical, upright and good\" character.[6] Rowling adds that Hermione's parents, two Muggle dentists, are a bit bemused by their odd daughter but \"quite proud of her all the same\".[6] They are well aware of the wizard world and have visited Diagon Alley with her.[7] Hermione is an only child.[6] But Rowling revealed in a 2004 interview that Hermione was originally intended to have a sister, but the planned sibling did not appear since she felt it \"might be too late now\" to introduce the character.[8] Rowling has called the character of Luna Lovegood the \"anti-Hermione\" as they are so very different.[9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n46. **^** Blay, Zeba (28 July 2015). \"Black 'Harry Potter' Characters Aren't Just Beautiful -- They're Revolutionary\". *HuffPost*.
