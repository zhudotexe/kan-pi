It is traditionally held on Patriots' Day, the third Monday of April.[1] Begun in 1897, the event was inspired by the success of the first marathon competition in the 1896 Summer Olympics.[2] The Boston Marathon is the world's oldest annual marathon and ranks as one of the world's best-known road racing events. It is one of six World Marathon Majors. Its course runs from Hopkinton in southern Middlesex County to Copley Square in Boston.\n\n\nThe Boston Athletic Association (B.A.A.) has organized this event annually since 1897,[3] including a \"virtual alternative\" after the 2020 road race was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The race has been managed by DMSE Sports since 1988. Amateur and professional runners from all over the world compete in the Boston Marathon each year, braving the hilly Massachusetts terrain and varying weather to take part in the race.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn October 28, 2020, the B.A.A. announced that the 2021 edition of the marathon would not be held in April; organizers stated that they hoped to stage the event later in the year, possibly in the autumn.[48] In late January 2021, organizers announced October 11 as the date for the marathon, contingent upon road races being allowed in Massachusetts at that time.[49] In March, organizers announced that the field would be limited to 20,000 runners.[50] The race was the fourth of the five World Marathon Majors held in 2021; all the events in the series were run in the space of six weeks between late September and early November.[51] In 2021, the B.A.A. also offered a virtual alternative to the in-person race to be completed anytime between 8-10 October.[52]\n\n\n\n## Race[edit]\n\n\n### Qualifying[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Sports | * Boston Bruins\n* Boston Celtics\n* Boston Marathon\n* Boston Red Sox\n* New England Free Jacks\n* New England Patriots\n* New England Revolution\n |\n| * Suffolk County\n* Greater Boston\n* Massachusetts\n* United States\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nWorld Marathon Majors\n |\n| --- |\n| Marathons | * Tokyo\n\t+ winners\n* Boston\n\t+ winners\n* London\n\t+ winners\n* Berlin\n\t+ winners\n* Chicago\n\t+ winners\n* New York City\n\t+ winners\n |\n| Results | * Final standings\n |\n| * Marathons at the World Athletics Championships\n* IAAF World Marathon Cup\n* Marathons at the Olympics\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nWorld Athletics Label Road Races\n |\n| --- |\n| Editions | * 2008\n* 2009\n* 2010\n* 2011\n* 2012\n* 2013\n* 2014\n* 2015\n* 2016\n* 2017\n* 2018\n* 2019\n* 2020\n* 2021\n* 2022\n* 2023\n* 2024\n |\n| Platinum | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Marathon | * Amsterdam\n* Berlin\n* Boston\n* Chicago\n* London\n* Nagoya\n* New York City\n* Osaka Women's\n* Seoul\n* Shanghai\n* Sydney\n* Tokyo\n* Valencia\n* Xiamen\n |\n| Half marathon | * Bangsaen\n* Guadalajara\n |\n\n |\n| Gold | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n\nThe Boston Marathon was originally a local event, but its fame and status have attracted runners from all over the world. For most of its history, the Boston Marathon was a free event, and the only prize awarded for winning the race was a wreath woven from olive branches.[11] However, corporate-sponsored cash prizes began to be awarded in the 1980s, when professional athletes refused to run the race unless a cash award was available. The first cash prize for winning the marathon was awarded in 1986.[12]\n\n\nWalter A. Brown was the President of the Boston Athletic Association from 1941 to 1964.[13] During the height of the Korean War in 1951, Brown denied Koreans entry into the Boston Marathon. He stated: \"While American soldiers are fighting and dying in Korea, every Korean should be fighting to protect his country instead of training for marathons. As long as the war continues there, we positively will not accept Korean entries for our race on April 19.\"[14]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Organized by the British Sports Association for the Disabled (BASD), 19 people competed and 17 finished. Gordon Perry of the United Kingdom won the Men's Wheelchair Race, coming in at 3:20:07, and Denise Smith, also of the UK, won the Women's Wheelchair Race in 4:29:03.[31]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSince 2006, the elite race has been part of the World Marathon Majors, which includes six of the world's top level marathon races. The London Marathon has seen the marathon world record broken on seven occasions: Khalid Khannouchi broke the men's record in 2002, while women's records have been broken by Grete Waitz (1983), Ingrid Kristiansen (1985), Paula Radcliffe (2002, 2003, 2005) and Mary Jepkosgei Keitany (2017).

In 2001, Naoko Takahashi became the first woman to run a sub-2:20 marathon, completing the Berlin Marathon in 2:19:46. The race had continued to be the venue of world records; between 2003 and 2018, seven men's records were set at the race; the most recent remains as the current world record time; Eliud Kipchoge's 2:01:39.[7][8]\n\n\nThe event was held in mid-September in 2000 and 2018, because of a conflict with the Women's Olympic Marathon, and due to German Unity Day preparations, respectively.[9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n15. **^** 2018 Berlin Marathon.

While marathons sporadically occurred in New York City and St. Louis,[12] the Boston Marathon had established an annual marathon in 1897, soon to be followed by a Chicago annual race.[13] Beginning in 1905,[14] the Chicago Marathon (organized first by the Illinois Athletic Club 1905 to 1909, then sponsored by the *Chicago Daily News* after 1910) was held annually, with significant community and spectator support, until the early 1920s.[15]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* 2015\u201316: Florence Kiplagat (KEN)\n* 2017: Tirunesh Dibaba (ETH)\n* 2018\u201319: Brigid Kosgei (KEN)\n* 2020: *cancelled*\n* 2021\u201322: Ruth Chepngetich (KEN)\n |\n| World Marathon Majors\nBerlin Marathon \u2013 List (M/W)\nBoston Marathon \u2013 List (M/W)\nChicago Marathon \u2013 List (M/W)\nLondon Marathon \u2013 List (M/W)\nNew York City Marathon \u2013 List (M/W)\nTokyo Marathon \u2013 List (M/W)\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nWorld Marathon Majors\n |\n| --- |\n| Marathons | * Tokyo\n\t+ winners\n* Boston\n\t+ winners\n* London\n\t+ winners\n* Berlin\n\t+ winners\n* Chicago\n\t+ winners\n* New York City\n\t+ winners\n |\n| Results | * Final standings\n |\n| * Marathons at the World Athletics Championships\n* IAAF World Marathon Cup\n* Marathons at the Olympics\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nWorld Athletics Label Road Races\n |\n| --- |\n| Editions | * 2008\n* 2009\n* 2010\n* 2011\n* 2012\n* 2013\n* 2014\n* 2015\n* 2016\n* 2017\n* 2018\n* 2019\n* 2020\n* 2021\n* 2022\n* 2023\n* 2024\n |\n| Platinum | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIt was not until the health consciousness of the 1960s that marathon growth gained traction in the public's eyes. Frank Shorter's 1972 Games of the XX Olympiad marathon victory represented the convergence of many middle-class American ideals.[18] Then the 1976 New York City Marathon, which was the first New York City Marathon to embrace the five borough course, popularized the big city marathon. As the New York marathon began to grow exponentially in the 1970s, the Chicago Marathon was established as a rival to the New York City Marathon.[3] By the mid-1980s, the Chicago Marathon was ensconced as one of the big four marathons.[19] During the mid-1980s, it was named America's Marathon/Chicago and opened up the way for appearance payments. Joan Benoit Samuelson described the Chicago Marathons of the mid-1980s as \"The World's Marathon\".[20] The Bank of America Chicago Marathon is an open race with no qualifying time to participate.[6]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* 2014: Eliud Kipchoge (KEN)\n* 2015: Dickson Chumba (KEN)\n* 2016: Abel Kirui (KEN)\n* 2017: Galen Rupp (USA)\n* 2018: Mo Farah (GBR)\n* 2019: Lawrence Cherono (KEN)\n* 2020: *cancelled*\n* 2021: Seifu Tura (ETH)\n* 2022: Benson Kipruto (KEN)\n* 2023: Kelvin Kiptum (KEN)\n |\n| World Marathon Majors\nBerlin Marathon \u2013 List (M/W)\nBoston Marathon \u2013 List (M/W)\nChicago Marathon \u2013 List (M/W)\nLondon Marathon \u2013 List (M/W)\nNew York City Marathon \u2013 List (M/W)\nTokyo Marathon \u2013 List (M/W)\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAnnual footrace held in Chicago, U.S.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Chicago Marathon |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)Logo for the Chicago Marathon\n |\n| Date | Second Sunday in October (before Columbus Day) |\n| Location | Chicago, Illinois, United States |\n| Event type | Road |\n| Distance | 26.219 miles (42.195\u00a0km) |\n| Established | 1977; 47\u00a0years ago\u00a0(1977) |\n| Last held | 2023 |\n| Course records | **M**: 2:00:35 \\**WR*(2023 \u2013 Kelvin Kiptum)**F**: 2:13:44(2023 \u2013 Sifan Hassan) |\n| Official site | chicagomarathon.com |\n\n\nThe **Chicago Marathon** is a marathon race held every October in Chicago, Illinois.

The marathon grew in popularity two years later when Norwegian Grete Waitz broke the women's world record, finishing in 2:32:30. She went on to win the race an unprecedented nine times.[9] An official wheelchair and handcycle division was introduced in 2000 and starting in 2002, the elite women are given a 35-minute head start before the elite men and rest of the field.\n\n\nBeginning in 1976, the race was run in late October and continued to be held in late October until 1986, when the race day was moved to November. The earliest race day was the marathon's first; the latest date in the marathon season was November 14, 1993. The hottest year for the race was 1979 when the race day of October 21 reached 80\u00a0\u00b0F (27\u00a0\u00b0C). The coldest race was in 1995 when the race day of November 12 only reached 43\u00a0\u00b0F (6\u00a0\u00b0C), with an intense wind chill.[6]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Runners before the race at Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge in the 2007 marathon.\n![](image)Professional wheelers heading for the starting line in 2007.\nThe 2007 race was held on Sunday, November 4. It was the final race of the 2006\u20132007 World Marathon Majors, a two-year series of elite marathon racing that also included the Boston, Chicago, London and Berlin marathons. However, there were very few elite American marathoners participating in 2007 because many had competed the day before at the 2008 USA Men's Olympic Marathon Trials, which was held in conjunction with the New York City Marathon on some of the same course.\n\n\nMartin Lel from Kenya won the men's race in a time of 2:09:04, completing a double of the 2007 London and New York Marathons. The women's winner was the world marathon record holder Paula Radcliffe from Great Britain in a time of 2:23:09, one second faster than her 2004 win.\n\n\n\n#### 2008[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAmerican race\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| New York City Marathon |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)The TCS New York City Marathon logo\n |\n| Date | First Sunday in November[1] |\n| Location | New York City, U.S. |\n| Event type | Road |\n| Distance | Marathon26.219 miles (42.195\u00a0km) |\n| Primary sponsor | TCS (since 2013)[2] |\n| Established | 1970, 54 years ago |\n| Course records | 2:04:58 Tamirat Tola (2023)2:22:31 Margaret Okayo (2003) |\n| Official site | www.nycmarathon.org |\n\n\nThe **New York City Marathon**, currently branded as the **TCS New York City Marathon** for sponsorship reasons, is an annual marathon (42.195\u00a0km or 26.219\u00a0mi) that courses through the five boroughs of New York City.
