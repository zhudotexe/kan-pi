A rock head elevation of 8,850\u00a0m (29,035\u00a0ft), and a snow/ice elevation 1\u00a0m (3\u00a0ft) higher, were obtained via this device.[36] Although as of 2001, it has not been officially recognised by Nepal,[37] this figure is widely quoted. Geoid uncertainty casts doubt upon the accuracy claimed by both the 1999 and 2005 (see \u00a7 21st-century surveys) surveys.[38]\n\n\nIn 1955, a detailed photogrammetric map (at a scale of 1:50,000) of the Khumbu region, including the south side of Mount Everest, was made by Erwin Schneider as part of the 1955 International Himalayan Expedition, which also attempted Lhotse.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n**This article contains Tibetan script.** Without proper rendering support, you may see very small fonts, misplaced vowels or missing conjuncts instead of Tibetan characters.\n\n![](image)North Face as seen from the path to North Base Camp\n![](image)Everest and Lhotse from the south.

The China\u2013Nepal border runs across its summit point.[2] Its elevation (snow height) of 8,848.86\u00a0m (29,031\u00a0ft 8+1\u20442\u00a0in) was most recently established in 2020 by the Chinese and Nepali authorities.[3][4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNearby peaks include Lhotse, 8,516\u00a0m (27,940\u00a0ft); Nuptse, 7,855\u00a0m (25,771\u00a0ft), and Changtse, 7,580\u00a0m (24,870\u00a0ft) among others. Another nearby peak is Khumbutse, and many of the highest mountains in the world are near Mount Everest.

It is a part of the same extended area of uplift (including the Karakoram, the Tibetan Plateau, and the Himalayas) as Mount Everest, and it is possible to follow a path from K2 to Everest that goes no lower than 4,594 metres (15,072\u00a0ft), at the Kora La on the Nepal/China border in the Mustang Lo. Many other peaks far lower than K2 are more independent in this sense.

It stands over 3,000 metres (9,840\u00a0ft) above much of the glacial valley bottoms at its base. It is a consistently steep pyramid, dropping quickly in almost all directions. The north side is the steepest: there it rises over 3,200 metres (10,500\u00a0ft) above the K2 (Qogir) Glacier in only 3,000 metres (9,800\u00a0ft) of horizontal distance. In most directions, it achieves over 2,800 metres (9,200\u00a0ft) of vertical relief in less than 4,000 metres (13,000\u00a0ft).[28]\n\n\nA 1986 expedition led by George Wallerstein made an inaccurate measurement showing that K2 was taller than Mount Everest, and therefore the tallest mountain in the world.[29] A corrected measurement was made in 1987, but by then the claim that K2 was the tallest mountain in the world had already made it into many news reports and reference works.[30]\n\n\n\n## Height[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAlthough the summit of Everest is at a higher altitude, K2 is a more difficult and dangerous climb, due in part to its more northern location, where inclement weather is more common.[12] The summit was reached for the first time by the Italian climbers Lino Lacedelli and Achille Compagnoni, on the 1954 Italian expedition led by Ardito Desio. As of February\u00a02021[update], only 377 people have summited K2.[13] There have been 91 deaths during attempted climbs.\n\n\nMost ascents are made during July and August, typically the warmest times of the year.[14] But in January 2021, K2 became the final eight-thousander to be summited in the winter; the mountaineering feat was accomplished by a team of Nepalese climbers, led by Nirmal Purja and Mingma Gyalje Sherpa.[15][16]\n\n\nK2 has now been climbed by almost all of its ridges, but unlike other eight-thousanders, never from its eastern face.[17]\n\n\n\n\n## Name[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nK2's height given on maps and encyclopedias is 8,611 metres (28,251\u00a0ft). In the summer of 2014, a Pakistani-Italian expedition to K2, named \"K2 60 Years Later\", was organized to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the first ascent of K2. One of the goals of the expedition was to accurately measure the height of the mountain using satellite navigation. The height of K2 measured during this expedition was 8,609.02 metres (28,244.8\u00a0ft).[31][32]\n\n\n\n## Geology[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

In the north, it is limited by the Lhonak Chu, Goma Chu and Jongsang La, and in the east by the Teesta River. The western limit runs from the Jongsang La down the Gingsang and Kangchenjunga glaciers and the rivers of Ghunsa and Tamur.[1] Kanchenjunga rises about 20\u00a0km (12\u00a0mi) south of the general alignment of the Great Himalayan range about 125\u00a0km (78\u00a0mi) east-southeast of Mount Everest as the crow flies. South of the southern face of Kanchenjunga runs the 3,000\u20133,500-metre-high (9,800\u201311,500\u00a0ft) Singalila Ridge that separates Sikkim from Nepal and northern West Bengal.[15]\n\n\nKangchenjunga and its satellite peaks form a huge mountain massif.[16] The massif's five highest peaks are listed in the following table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nEight-thousanders (and major subsidiary peaks)\n |\n| --- |\n| * Everest\n\t+ South Summit\n* K2\n* Kangchenjunga\n* Lhotse\n\t+ Lhotse Middle\n\t+ Lhotse Shar\n* Makalu\n* Cho Oyu\n* Dhaulagiri\n* Manaslu\n* Nanga Parbat\n* Annapurna I\n\t+ Annapurna I East\n\t+ Annapurna I Middle Peak\n* Gasherbrum I\n* Broad Peak\n* Gasherbrum II\n* Shishapangma\n |\n| * List of ski descents of eight-thousanders\n* List of climbers summiting all eight-thousanders\n* List of deaths on eight-thousanders\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nUntil 1852, Kangchenjunga was assumed to be the highest mountain in the world, but calculations and measurements by the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India in 1849 showed that Mount Everest, known as Peak XV at the time, is actually higher. After allowing for further verification of all calculations, it was officially announced in 1856 that Kangchenjunga was the third-highest mountain.[6]\n\n\nThe Kangchenjunga is a sacred mountain in Nepal and Sikkim and was first climbed on 25 May 1955 by Joe Brown and George Band, who were part of the 1955 British Kangchenjunga expedition. They stopped just short of the true summit, keeping a promise given to Tashi Namgyal, the Chogyal of Sikkim, that the top of the mountain would remain inviolate.[7] The Indian side of the mountain is off-limits to climbers. In 2016, the adjoining Khangchendzonga National Park was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Despite the tremendous vertical relief of its South and Northeast Faces, it is the least prominent of the eight-thousanders due to the great height of the South Col between it and Everest. Lhotse's Western Face, recessed behind the head of the Khumbu Glacier in the Western Cwm, plays an integral part in the standard routes of ascent for both peaks; the name Lhotse, which means \"South Peak\" in Tibetan, further emphasizes the close relationship between the two.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n## Further reading[edit]\n\n\n* Reiss, Ernst (1959). *Mein Weg als Bergsteiger* (in German).

It is located in the Mahalangur Himalayas 19\u00a0km (12\u00a0mi) southeast of Mount Everest, on the China\u2013Nepal border. One of the eight-thousanders, Makalu is an isolated peak in the shape of a four-sided pyramid.\n\n\nMakalu has two notable subsidiary peaks. Kangchungtse, or Makalu II (7,678\u00a0m) lies about three kilometres (two miles) north-northwest of the main summit. Rising about 5\u00a0km (3\u00a0mi) north-northeast of the main summit across a broad plateau, and connected to Kangchungtse by a narrow, 7,200\u00a0m saddle, is Chomo Lonzo (7,804\u00a0m).\n\n\n\n\n## Climbing history[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Makalu |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)Makalu from the southwest\n |\n| Highest\u00a0point |\n| Elevation | 8,481\u00a0m (27,825\u00a0ft)[1][notes 1]Ranked 5th |\n| Prominence | 2,386\u00a0m (7,828\u00a0ft) |\n| Listing | Eight-thousanderUltra |\n| Coordinates | 27\u00b053\u203223\u2033N 87\u00b005\u203220\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff27.88972\u00b0N 87.08889\u00b0E\ufeff / 27.88972; 87.08889[1] |\n| Geography |\n| ![Makalu is located in Koshi Province](image)![Makalu](image)\nMakalu\nLocation in Nepal and Tibet Autonomous Region\nShow map of Koshi Province\n![Makalu is located in Nepal](image)![Makalu](image)\nMakalu\nMakalu (Nepal)\nShow map of Nepal\n![Makalu is located in Tibet](image)![Makalu](image)\nMakalu\nMakalu (Tibet)\nShow map of Tibet\n |\n| Location | Province No. 1 (Khumbu), Nepal / Tibet Autonomous Region, China |\n| Parent range | Mahalangur Himalayas |\n| Climbing |\n| First ascent | May 15, 1955, by Lionel Terray and Jean Couzy |\n| Easiest route | snow/ice climb |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* 2006: On or about January 27 the French mountaineer Jean-Christophe Lafaille disappeared on Makalu while trying to make the first winter ascent.[15]\n* 2009: Makalu was first climbed in winter on February 9, 2009, by Italian Simone Moro and Kazakh Denis Urubko.[16][17] It was the final Nepali eight-thousander to be climbed in winter conditions. Moro had previously made the first winter ascent of Shishapangma in winter 2005 with Pole Piotr Morawski.\n* 2022: Ecuadorian Karl Egloff set a new speed record by ascending in 17 hours 18 minutes on May 8, 2022. He climbed without sherpa support and without bottled oxygen.
