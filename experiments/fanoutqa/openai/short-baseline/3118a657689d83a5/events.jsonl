The most recent to join the list were Leicester City (2015–16 champions) and before that, Nottingham Forest (1977–78) and Derby County (1971–72).\n\n\nFive teams have won the league title three seasons in a row: Huddersfield Town (1924–1926), Arsenal (1933–1935), Liverpool (1982–1984), Manchester United twice (1999–2001 & 2007–2009) and Manchester City (2021–2023).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRules stipulating a maximum wage for players were abolished in 1961. This resulted in a shift of power towards bigger clubs.[7] Financial considerations became an even bigger influence from 1992, when the teams then in the First Division defected to form the FA Premier League. This supplanted the Football League First Division as the highest level of football in England,[8] and due to a series of progressively larger television contracts, put unprecedented wealth into the hands of top flight clubs.[9] The first five champions in the Premier League era – Arsenal, Blackburn Rovers, Chelsea, Manchester City and Manchester United – had all won the title at least once prior to 1992. Leicester City were champions for the first time in 2016, becoming the first team to win the Premier League without having previously won the First Division. Other than inaugural league champions Preston North End, Ipswich Town remain the only club to win the top flight division at their first ever attempt.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSeven teams have at some point held first or joint first place in the number of titles won: Preston North End (1889–1895), Sunderland (1893–1899 and 1936–1953), Aston Villa (1897–1953), Arsenal (1948–1976), Liverpool (1966–1971 and 1973–2011), Manchester United (1967–1971 and 2009–) and Everton (1970–1971).\n\n\nEight teams have finished as runners up without ever finishing top: Bristol City (1906–07), Oldham Athletic (1914–15), Cardiff City (1923–24), Charlton Athletic (1936–37), Blackpool (1955–56), Queens Park Rangers (1975–76), Watford (1982–83) and Southampton (1983–84). Of these, Cardiff City came closest to winning the league, matching champions Huddersfield Town in points but losing out on goal average (goals scored divided by goals conceded), the precursor to goal difference.\n\n\nTeams in **bold** compete in the Premier League as of the 2023–24 season.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nManchester United\nclass=notpageimage|\nGreater Manchester\n![List of English football champions is located in Merseyside](image)![Everton](image)\nEverton\n![Liverpool](image)\nLiverpool\nclass=notpageimage|\nLiverpool\n![List of English football champions is located in West Midlands county](image)![Aston Villa](image)\nAston Villa\n![West Bromwich Albion](image)\nWest Bromwich Albion\n![Wolverhampton Wanderers](image)\nWolverhampton Wanderers\nclass=notpageimage|\nWest Midlands\n\n![List of English football champions is located in Greater London](image)![Arsenal](image)\nArsenal\n![Chelsea](image)\nChelsea\n![Tottenham Hotspur](image)\nTottenham Hotspur\nclass=notpageimage|\nGreater London\n |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSpecific\n1. **^** \"The History of the Football League\". *Football League website*.
