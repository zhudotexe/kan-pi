On average they stand between 20 and 26 inches (51 and 66\u00a0cm) and weigh between 35 and 75 pounds (16 and 34\u00a0kg).[11][12] Tough feet are an important feature and desirable trait for breeding consideration. As with their build, the Alaskan husky's coat can vary greatly; they usually have double coats with all colors and patterns of colors seen within various lines.[11][12] Distance-type Alaskan huskies often have denser double coats to better contend with cold temperatures and harsh wind, whereas sprint lines have shorter coats to allow for greater heat dissipation during races at high speeds.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDog breed\n\n\n| Alaskan husky |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)An Alaskan husky resting during a run at Riley Creek Campground in Denali National Park and Preserve, Denali Park, AK\n |\n| Origin | United States (Alaska) |\n| Breed status | Not recognized as a breed by any major kennel club. |\n| \n\n| Traits |\n| --- |\n| Height | \n20\u201326\u00a0in (51\u201366\u00a0cm) |\n| Weight | \n35\u201375\u00a0lb (16\u201334\u00a0kg) |\n| Coat | \nUsually double coat |\n| Color | \nAny color or pattern |\n| Life\u00a0span | \n10\u201315 years |\n\n |\n| Dog (domestic dog) |\n\n\nThe **Alaskan husky** is a breed of medium-sized working sled dog, developed specifically for its performance as such.[1][2][3]\n\n\nAlaskan huskies are the most commonly used type of dog for competitive sled dog racing, both in short-distance sprint racing as well as long-distance expedition races such as the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race,[4] the Yukon Quest,[5] and the Finnmarkslopet.\n\n\n\n\n## Description[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)An Alaskan husky at Denali National Park and Preserve, Alaska\n![](image)Alaskan husky standing on his doghouseIn the latter half of the 20th century the primary use of sled dogs shifted from utility to sport, particularly career competitive sled dog racing. In order to facilitate greater speed for racing sport, various breeds of gundogs and sighthounds have now been bred into Alaskan husky lines, including Pointers, Greyhounds, German Shorthaired Pointers, Salukis, Borzois, Labradors and Setters; some breeders have even used wolves at various points.[10][12][11]\n\n\n## Lineage[edit]\n\n\nGenetic studies indicate that the Alaskan Husky originates from pre-Colonial North American Arctic village dogs (including precursors to the Alaskan Malamute) and Siberian imports (precursors to the Siberian Husky), crossbred with European breeds such as Pointers, German Shepherd Dogs, and Salukis to improve its performance.[9][8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe behaviors and temperament of the Alaskan husky can vary greatly due to the wide range of genetic backgrounds and bred-purposes within the breed. As with all sled dogs, a desire to pull and run are essential and are of high priority in decisions of breeding. Mental soundness is also important due to the need for dogs to be in close quarters with other dogs while hooked in the team, handled by people for proper care and transportation, and for dogs on racing teams to perform under environments which include trails crowded with spectators and other dog teams.[15]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Five-year-old male Alaskan husky from championship distance racing lines\nLike most working sled dogs, Alaskan huskies are capable of pulling far greater than their own body weight in load while in harness. Sprint teams of Alaskan huskies are capable of speeds of up to 28\u00a0mph (45\u00a0km/h),[16] whereas distance-specialist teams have completed 938 mile (1510\u00a0km) races in just 8 days, 3 hours, 40 minutes, and 13 seconds with time including 40 hours of mandatory rests and other routine rests on the trail.[17]\n\n\nAs specifically purposed working sled dogs, Alaskan huskies can be subject to climate or work-specific health conditions that any sled dogs may experience, such as temperature-related bronchitis or bronchopulmonary ailments, also known as \"ski asthma\".[18]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)A three-year-old male Alaskan husky\nThe Alaskan husky has selectively been bred specifically for its athletic performance.[14][5] As such, its level of athletic ability, as well as anabolic efficiency are far greater than the average domesticated dog, especially in endurance feats. Distance-specialist Alaskan huskies out-speed most animals and all other types of sled dogs when running distances of 50 miles or greater, even while pulling moderately sized loads.[5] Studies on the metabolic capabilities in working Alaskan husky sled dogs reveal that their system transitions to utilization of low-glucose energy sources (from high-glycogen carbohydrates) early on during long periods of travel, and their reliance on these low-glucose fuels (such as those higher in fats and proteins) continue and even extend to become more pronounced after working for longer periods.[14] A good appetite is a highly desirable trait, and is emphasized in breeding choices.[15]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Alaskan husky is not an officially recognized breed by any kennel club, nor does it have a formal breed standard.[6] Unlike breeds developed for the show ring, the Alaskan husky is instead a product of careful selection for desirable sled dog traits from various other breeds, such as aptitude for pulling, endurance, speed, intelligence, appetite, and tolerance of extreme weather.[7][8] As a result of this specific and mindful performance-only based breeding, DNA studies show that Alaskan Huskies share a genetic signature and indeed can be identified accurately on DNA breed tests.[9]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Several European studies found a much lower prevalence (20\u201339%), which may reflect the significant genetic divergence between the American and European populations. They are especially prone to hemangiosarcoma and lymphoma, with an estimated lifetime risk of one in five for the former and one in eight for the latter. The high prevalence of cancer deaths among Golden Retrievers may partly represent a lack of other congenital diseases.[19][20][21]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Exercise, especially daily walks, is preferred for this breed to live a long and healthy life.[16] The oldest known Shiba, Pusuke, died at age 26 in early December 2011. Pusuke was the oldest known dog alive at the time and lived 5 years less than the world record for the longest living dog.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Grooming[edit]\n\n\nShiba Inus are very clean, so grooming needs will likely be minimal. They naturally tend to hate to be wet or bathed, thus, it is very important to get them accustomed when they are young. A Shiba Inu's coat is coarse (short to medium length), with the outer coat being 2.5 to 3.2\u00a0cm (1 to 1+1\u20444\u00a0in) long, and is naturally waterproof so there is little need for regular bathing. They have a thick undercoat that can protect them from temperatures well below freezing.[28]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

The ears are large and stand erect, open at the front and parallel, but they often are pulled back during movement. A German Shepherd has a long neck, which is raised when excited and lowered when moving at a fast pace as well as stalking. The tail is bushy and reaches to the hock.[28]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCurrently, Labradors and Golden Retrievers are more widely used for this work, although there are still German Shepherds being trained. In 2013, about 15% of the dogs trained by Guide Dogs of America were German Shepherds, while the remainder are Labrador Retrievers and Golden Retrievers.[62] The Guide Dogs for the Blind Association in the United Kingdom trains some German Shepherds,[63] while the comparable organisation in the US only trains Labrador Retrievers, Golden Retrievers and crosses between these breeds.[64]\n\n\nGerman Shepherds are still used for herding and tending sheep grazing in meadows next to gardens and crop fields. They are expected to patrol the boundaries to keep sheep from trespassing and damaging the crops. In Germany and other places these skills are tested in utility dog trials also known as Herdengebrauchshund (HGH) herding utility dog trials.[65]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n47. **^** \"KC confirms position on German Shepherds\". *Our Dogs-UK*.
