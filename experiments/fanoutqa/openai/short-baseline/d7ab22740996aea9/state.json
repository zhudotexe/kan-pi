Such occurrences have been reported in many countries throughout history.[1] One hypothesis is that tornadic waterspouts sometimes pick up creatures such as fish or frogs, and carry them for up to several miles.[1][2] However, this aspect of the phenomenon has never been witnessed by scientists.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRain of flightless animals and things has been reported throughout history.[1] In the first century AD, Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder documented storms of frogs and fish.[4] In 1794, French soldiers saw toads fall from the sky during heavy rain at Lalain, near the French city of Lille.[5] Rural inhabitants in Yoro, Honduras claim \"fish rain\" happens there every summer, a phenomenon they call Lluvia de Peces.[6]\n\n\n\n## Explanations[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Tornadoes and waterspouts may lift up animals into the air and deposit them miles away\nFrench physicist Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re (1775\u20131836) was among the first scientists to take seriously accounts of raining animals. Addressing the Society of Natural Science, Amp\u00e8re suggested that at times frogs and toads roam the countryside in large numbers, and that violent winds could pick them up and carry them great distances.[3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSome cases are thought to be caused by birds dropping fish. With regard to a documented rain of fish that occurred on December 29, 2021 in Texarkana, Texas, independent researchers Sharon A. Hill and Paul Cropper proposed that the fish had been dropped or possibly regurgitated by passing birds.[20] The theory found some favor with airport workers who had cleaned up the fish; they noted that there were birds in the area around the same time, and the fish \"were kind of chewed up\". In June 2022 around the San Francisco coast, a boom of anchovies is likely to be the cause of fair weather falling of fish from birds' mouths, such as pelicans.[21]\n\n\n\n## Occurrences[edit]\n\n\nThe following list is a selection of examples.\n\n\n\n### Fish[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Dennis, Jerry.

The total number of Christians for each country is based on the number of people who are members of a Christian denomination or who identify themselves as Christian, plus their children. The number of people who actually believe in God or who regularly attend church is not addressed. People who mix Christianity with tribal religions are counted as Christians in this article. Most of the numbers for the Christian percentage of the population for each country were taken from the US State Department's *International Religious Freedom Report*, the *CIA World Factbook*, Joshua Project, Open doors, Pew Forum, and Adherents.com.\n\n\n\n#### Top ten by numbers (2010)[edit]\n\n\nA list of the top ten countries by largest number of Christians according to Pew Research Center in 2010.[26][27]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
