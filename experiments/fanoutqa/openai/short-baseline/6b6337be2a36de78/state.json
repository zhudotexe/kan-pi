By 1926 this number had grown to over 8000.[5] The breed gained international recognition after the end of World War I. Returning soldiers spoke highly of the breed and animal actors Rin Tin Tin and Strongheart popularised the breed further.[67] The first German Shepherd Dog registered in the United States was Queen of Switzerland. Her offspring had defects as the result of poor breeding, which caused the breed to decline in popularity during the late 1920s.[67]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nDogs originating in Germany\n |\n| --- |\n| Hounds | * Bavarian Mountain Hound\n* German Hound\n* Hanover Hound\n* Westphalian Dachsbracke\n |\n| Gundogs | * German Longhaired Pointer\n* German Roughhaired Pointer\n* German Shorthaired Pointer\n* German Spaniel\n* German Wirehaired Pointer\n* Large M\u00fcnsterl\u00e4nder\n* Poodle\n* Pudelpointer\n* Small M\u00fcnsterl\u00e4nder\n* Weimaraner\n |\n| Herding dogs | * German Shepherd\n* Old German herding dogs\n |\n| Earth dogs | * Dachshund\n* Jagdterrier\n* Miniature Schnauzer\n |\n| Toy dogs | * Affenpinscher\n* Biewer Terrier\n* Miniature Pinscher\n* Pomeranian\n |\n| Others | * American Eskimo Dog\n* Boxer\n* Dobermann\n* Eurasier\n* German Pinscher\n* German Spitz\n* Giant Schnauzer\n* Great Dane\n* Hovawart\n* Keeshond\n* Kromfohrl\u00e4nder\n* Leonberger\n* Rottweiler\n* Standard Schnauzer\n |\n| Extinct | * Bullenbeisser\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n25. **^** \"Change of Name\u00a0\u2013 German Shepherd Dog\". *The Kennel Club*. 19 October 2010.

P. Morgans. The American Kennel Club recognized the breed quickly after the breed club was formed, and by 1906 the French Bulldog was the fifth most popular dog breed in America.[5]:\u200a8 In 2013, the American Kennel Club (AKC) ranked the French Bulldog as the 10th most popular breed in the United States, enjoying a sharp rise in popularity from 54th place a decade before, in 2003.[11] By 2014, they had moved up to become the ninth most popular AKC registered dog breed in the US and by the 2017 they were the fourth most popular.[12]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAccording to the American Kennel Club, the French Bulldog has overtaken the Labrador as the most popular breed of dog.
