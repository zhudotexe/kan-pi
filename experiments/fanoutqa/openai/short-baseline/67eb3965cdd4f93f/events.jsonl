There are about 50 AOCs applicable to the Bordeaux region.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWine growing areas in France\n\nThis article is about the various different regions, or AOCs, which lie within the wine region of Bordeaux. For the wine generally, see Bordeaux wine.\n\nThe **wine regions of Bordeaux** are a large number of wine growing areas, differing widely in size and sometimes overlapping, which lie within the overarching wine region of Bordeaux, centred on the city of Bordeaux and covering the whole area of the Gironde department of Aquitaine.\n\n\nThe Bordeaux region is naturally divided by the Gironde Estuary into a Left Bank area which includes the Médoc and Graves and a Right Bank area which includes the Libournais, Bourg and Blaye. The Médoc is itself divided into Haut-Médoc (the upstream or southern portion) and Bas-Médoc (the downstream or northern portion, often referred to simply as \"Médoc\").\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBoth red and white Bordeaux wines are almost invariably blended. The permissible grape varieties in red Bordeaux are: Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Malbec and Petit Verdot. While wine making styles vary, a rule of thumb is that the Left Bank is predominantly Cabernet Sauvignon based with the Right Bank being more Merlot based. The Graves area produces both red wine (from the grapes previously mentioned) and white wine from the Sauvignon blanc, Sémillon and Muscadelle grapes. The area of Sauternes (including Barsac) is known for its botrytized dessert wines.[2]\n\n\n\n![](image)Bordeaux wine regions of Gironde department and its appellations\n\n## Classifications[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe area is home to more 21 classified growths, more than any other appellation, with numerous second and third growths as well as one first growth, Château Margaux.[25][29]\n\n\n\n##### Southern Médoc[edit]\n\n\nThe area just south of Margaux is called Southern Médoc with wines produced in this area using the Haut-Médoc designation. This area includes the classified growths of Château La Lagune in Ludon and Château Cantemerle in Macau.[30]\n\n\n\n### Graves[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Graves (wine region)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA small amount of sparkling wine is made in the Bordeaux region, under the appellation **Crémant-de-Bordeaux AOC** (known before 1990 as Bordeaux Mousseux). This is made using the methode traditionelle from the same grapes as white Bordeaux if white and the same grapes as red Bordeaux if rosé. The great majority is white, accounting for around 900,000 litres of production, as opposed to 20,000 litres of rosé.[15]\n\n\nThe appellation **Vin de Pays de l'Atlantique** was introduced in 2006, as a complement to the existing range of Bordeaux appellations, and covers grape varieties not permitted in classic Bordeaux, notably Chardonnay for white wines and Syrah for red wines. Nearly 4 million litres of wine is produced under this appellation, 62% of it red.[16]\n\n\n\n## Left Bank[edit]\n\n\nThe wine regions of the Left bank of the Gironde estuary are bordered by large coniferous forest land that have a tempering effect on the maritime climate of the area.\n\n\n\n### The Médoc[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Médoc AOC\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nRed wine produced under the **Bordeaux AOC** is made mostly from Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, with the addition of Cabernet Franc and small amounts of Petit Verdot, Malbec and Carmenère. This appellation covers around 42,600 hectares of vines and produces around 223 million litres of wine (which is nearly a third of the total wine production of Bordeaux).[5] White wine produced under the **Bordeaux Sec AOC** is made mostly from Sauvignon blanc and Sémillon, with the addition of some Muscadelle, Colombard, Mauzac, Merlot blanc, Ondenc and Ugni blanc.[6] It must contain no more than 4g/L of residual sugar. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe area received appellation status in 1987 and produces both red and white wines.[35] All of the estates named in the 1959 Graves classification are located in this appellation.[34] Cabernet Sauvignon is the dominant grape variety, followed by Merlot and the white wine grapes Sauvignon blanc and Sémillon. The white wines of this area are barrel fermented and aged on their lees.[33]\n\n\n\n#### Sauternes and Barsac[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sauternes (wine)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)The Garonne and Dordogne rivers meet near Bourg\nNorth of Libournais, this area sits on the Right Bank of the Garonne and Dordogne rivers and is one of the oldest wine producing regions in Bordeaux, exporting wine long before the Médoc was even planted. Merlot is the main grape of the area followed by Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Malbec. The area around Bourg also has sizable Sauvignon blanc planting for sparkling wines and Ugni blanc for cognac.[40]\n\n\n\n#### The Blayais-Bourgeais appellations[edit]\n\n\n* Blaye AOC\n* Blaye-Côtes-de-Bordeaux AOC (formerly Premières-côtes-de-Blaye AOC), a sub-appellation of Côtes-de-Bordeaux AOC\n* Côtes-de-Bourg\n\n\n#### Côtes-de-Bourg[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Côtes-de-Bourg\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThis includes the area between St. Julien and Margaux. This area is home to many Crus Bourgeois. Within the Central Medoc there are the appellations Listrac-Médoc and Moulis-en-Médoc. Within Moulis, some wines estates near the village of Grand Poujeaux have added that name to their labels. The Listrac appellation is located on a limestone based plateau and produced highly tannic wines that require a bit of aging before they soften.[28]\n\n\n\n##### Margaux[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Margaux AOC\n\nThe Margaux appellation encompasses the village of Margaux and the neighboring villages of Arsac, Labarde, Soussans and Cantenac. It is the most southerly of Médoc's appellations. This region has the thinnest soil in the region with the highest proportion of gravel that allows the soil to drain very well. The wines from this area are very susceptible to weather effects during the growing season and harvest.[29]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe southern or up-stream part is known as the *Haut-Médoc* (upper Médoc). This region is some 45 km long, by 10 km wide. The total area under vines is around 4800 hectares, producing 22 million litres of wine a year. 6 villages have their own appellations: Margaux, St-Julien, Pauillac, St-Estèphe, Listrac and Moulis. The remainder is classified simply as *Haut-Médoc*.[20] The predominant grape planted here is Cabernet Sauvignon, although before 1800 it was Malbec.[21]\n\n\n\n##### St-Estèphe[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Saint-Estèphe AOC\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThis appellation covers around 6500 hectares of vines and 38 million litres of wine.[7] If it has more than 4g/L of residual sugar, then it may be labelled as **Bordeaux Molleux AOC**, but little wine is in fact produced under this AOC.[8] **Bordeaux Supérieur AOC** covers both red and white wines, and the grapes used are the same, but permitted yields are slightly lower, minimum alcohol content is slightly higher and slightly longer aging is required.[9] The amount of red wine produced under this appellation (around 45 million litres, from 10,000 hectares of vines) is much greater than the amount of white wine produced (around 170,000 litres from 60 hectares).[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe region spans the left bank of the Gironde from the mouth of the river to the city of Bordeaux and includes the four famous communes of St-Estephe, Pauillac, St. Julien and Margaux. It is about 60 km north to south, and about 10 km wide, with around 10,600 hectares under vines and a production of about 50 million litres per year. All the wine made here is red.[17]\n\n\n\n#### The Médoc appellations[edit]\n\n\n* Médoc AOC\n* Haut-Médoc AOC\n\t+ Saint-Estèphe AOC\n\t+ Pauillac AOC\n\t+ Saint-Julien AOC\n\t+ Listrac-Médoc AOC\n\t+ Moulis-en-Médoc AOC\n\t+ Margaux AOC\n\n\n#### Bas-Médoc[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThere are various sub-regions within the Haut-Médoc, including St-Estèphe, Pauillac, St.-Julien and Margaux and the less well known areas of AOC Moulis and Listrac. Graves includes the sub-regions of Pessac-Léognan and Sauternes (among others), and Sauternes in turn includes the sub-region of Barsac. The Libournais includes the sub-regions of Saint-Émilion and Pomerol (among others). There is an additional wine region of Entre-Deux-Mers, so called because it lies between the Garonne and Dordogne rivers, which combine to form the Gironde. This region contains several less well known sweet wine areas of Cadillac and St. Croix de Mont.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThis region is bordered on the north by the Garonne river and contains the sub regions of Pessac-Léognan, Sauternes and Barsac. It is known for its intensely gravelly soil.[31] The soil is the result glaciers from the Ice Age which also left white quartz deposits that can still be found in the soil of some of the top wine making estates.[32] While Château Haut-Brion was included in the 1855 classification of the Médoc, the Graves appellation itself was classified in 1953 for its red wine producers. White wine were included in an updated 1959 classification.[33]\n\n\nThe Graves is considered the birthplace of claret. In the Middle Ages, the wines that were first exported to England were produced in this area. Château Pape Clément, founded at the turn of the fourteenth century by the future Pope Clement V, was the first named chateaux in all of Bordeaux. In 1663, Samuel Pepys' mention of Château Haut-Brion was the first recorded mention of French Claret in London.[34]\n\n\n\n#### The Graves appellations[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThere are a number of classifications of Bordeaux wines, covering different regions. None of these attempts to be a comprehensive classification of all the producers within a given area: rather, only the producers (universally known as *châteaux*, although not usually possessing the architectural grandeur that might imply) perceived as being of an unusually high standard are included in the classification. The châteaux included in the classification are referred to as *classed* or *classé*, and those not included are referred to as *unclassed*. Some classifications sub-divide the classed châteaux, according to the perceived quality. On the Left Bank, the Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855 is the starting point for classification. Although this purports to be a classification of all Bordeaux wine, it in fact exclusively lists red wine producers from the Haut-Médoc plus Château Haut-Brion of Graves, and (in a separate list) sweet white wine producers from Sauternes (including Barsac). \n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_udYPwUqEx2NiBp6LCud30cgJ","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
