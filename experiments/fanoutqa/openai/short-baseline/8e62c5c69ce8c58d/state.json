Starting with the 2014\u201315 season, Top 14 teams compete in the new European club rugby competitions\u2014the European Rugby Champions Cup and European Rugby Challenge Cup. The Champions Cup and Challenge Cup replaced the previous European competitions, the Heineken Cup and Amlin Challenge Cup.[31]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOver recent years, the Top 14 has seen the economic strength of its clubs rise significantly. Aided by high attendance, large television rights contracts,[14] public subsidies and the rise of the euro exchange rate,[15] Top 14 clubs have seen their overall spending budget increase significantly. In 2011\u20132012, four clubs had a budget over 20 million euros: Toulouse (33), Clermont (24), Racing M\u00e9tro [now Racing 92] (22), Stade Francais (21).[16]\nThe average salary of players in the Top 14 was estimated to have risen, in 2010, to $153,700 (compared to $123,000 in the English Premiership).[17] The wealth of the Top 14 clubs has led them to attract a large number of international players,[18] and to build teams with more strength in depth (in 2011, Top 14 clubs could have as many as 45 players, compared to 33 for Leicester Tigers, 2010 Premiership winner).[19]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe **Top 14** (French pronunciation: [t\u0254p kat\u0254\u0280z]) is a professional rugby union club competition that is played in France. Created in 1892, the Top 14 is at the top of the national league system operated by the French National Rugby League, also known by its French initialism of LNR. There is promotion and relegation between the Top 14 and the next level down, the Rugby Pro D2. The fourteen best rugby teams in France participate in the competition, hence the name Top 14. The competition was previously known as the Top 16.\n\n\nThe league is one of the three major professional leagues in Europe (along with the English Premiership and the United Rugby Championship, which brings together top clubs from Ireland, Wales, Scotland, Italy and South Africa), from which the most successful European teams go forward to compete in the European Rugby Champions Cup, the pan-European championship which replaced the Heineken Cup after the 2013\u201314 season.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Top 14 is organized by the Ligue Nationale de Rugby (LNR), which runs the professional rugby leagues within France (Top 14 and Rugby Pro D2). There is a promotion and relegation system between the Top 14 and Pro D2. Starting with the 2017-18 season, only the lowest-placed club in the table after the regular season is automatically relegated to Pro D2. The playoff champion of Pro D2 is automatically promoted, while the next-to-last Top 14 club and the playoff runner-up of Pro D2 play each other to determine which club will be in Top 14, and which will be in Pro D2 the following season. Starting with the 2009\u201310 season, the Top 14 knock-out stages consist of three rounds. The teams finishing third through to sixth in the table play quarter-finals, hosted by the No. 3 and No. 4 teams. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe winners then face the top two seeds in the semi-finals, whose winners then meet in the final at the Stade de France (although the 2016 final was instead held at the Camp Nou in Barcelona, Spain due to a scheduling conflict with France's hosting of UEFA Euro 2016). In previous seasons, only the top four teams qualified for semi-finals. Unlike many other major rugby competitions (such as the Gallagher Premiership, Mitre 10 Cup, Currie Cup, and from 2009\u201310 the Celtic League/Pro12), the Top 14 has traditionally held its semi-finals at neutral sites.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nUnder the new structure, the top six teams on the Top 14 table qualify directly for the following season's Champions Cup. The seventh-placed team advances to a play-off for another Champions Cup place. In 2013\u201314, the play-off involved said Top 14 club and the seventh-placed club in the English Premiership. Initially, plans were for the play-off in subsequent years to also include two sides from Pro12 in the Celtic nations and Italy.[31] Due to fixture clashes with the Top 14 season, the play-off that followed the 2014\u201315 season involved only one Pro12 side.[32] Because the start of the 2015\u201316 European season ran up against the 2015 Rugby World Cup, the play-off was completely scrapped for that season, with the final Champions Cup place for 2016\u201317 instead awarded to the winner of the 2016 Challenge Cup.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n64. **^** \"Top 14 - Pro D2\u00a0: les pr\u00e9sidents d'accord pour ne pas attribuer de titre\".

Of these eight players, only four were regulars in the French national team.\n* During the 2012\u201313 Top 14, none of the top three points scorers were French, and only three of the top 10 try scorers were French.\n* Of the players who made the most appearances in their respective positions during that season, only three (out of 15) were French.\n* National team coach Philippe Saint-Andr\u00e9 suggested that several \"foreign\" players\u2014meaning players who were born and largely developed outside the country\u2014could make their debuts for France during the team's 2013 summer tour. Moriarty specifically named five such players as potential Test newcomers.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2011, Canal+ indicated that evening matches were being watched by between 800,000 and 850,000 viewers while afternoon matches were watched by around 700,000 viewers.[4]\n\n\nIn recent years, numerous foreign players have joined Top 14 teams.\n\n\n\n### Changes afoot[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2016, LNR released a strategic plan outlining its vision for French rugby through the 2023 Rugby World Cup. The plan includes significant changes to the top levels of the league system, although the changes were more dramatic for Pro D2 than for the Top 14. Changes affecting the Top 14 are:[5]\n\n\n\n* Starting with the 2017\u201318 season, the only club to be automatically relegated from Top 14 will be the bottom club on the league table. That club will be replaced by the Pro D2 champion.\n* From 2017\u201318, the second-from-bottom team on the Top 14 table will enter a playoff with the Pro D2 runner-up, with the winner taking up the final Top 14 place.\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
