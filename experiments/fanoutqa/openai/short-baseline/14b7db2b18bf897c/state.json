It established a route through the Khumbu icefall and ascended to the South Col at an elevation of 7,986\u00a0m (26,201\u00a0ft). Raymond Lambert and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay were able to reach an elevation of about 8,595\u00a0m (28,199\u00a0ft) on the southeast ridge, setting a new climbing altitude record. Tenzing's experience was useful when he was hired to be part of the British expedition in 1953.[102] The Swiss decided to make another post-monsoon attempt in the autumn; they made it to the South Col but were driven back by winter winds and severe cold.[103][104]\n\n\n\n### First successful ascent by Tenzing and Hillary, 1953[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 1953 British Mount Everest expedition\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 1953, a ninth British expedition, led by John Hunt, returned to Nepal. Hunt selected two climbing pairs to attempt to reach the summit. The first pair, Tom Bourdillon and Charles Evans, came within 100\u00a0m (330\u00a0ft) of the summit on 26 May 1953, but turned back after running into oxygen problems. As planned, their work in route finding and breaking trail and their oxygen caches were of great aid to the following pair. Two days later, the expedition made its second assault on the summit with the second climbing pair: the New Zealander Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay, a Nepali Sherpa climber. They reached the summit at 11:30\u00a0am local time on 29 May 1953 via the South Col route. At the time, both acknowledged it as a team effort by the whole expedition, but Tenzing revealed a few years later that Hillary had put his foot on the summit first.[105] They paused at the summit to take photographs and buried a few sweets and a small cross in the snow before descending.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nMount Everest\n |\n| --- |\n| Topographyand landmarks | * Base Camp\n* Geneva Spur\n* Hillary Step\n* Hornbein Couloir\n* Kangshung Face (East Face)\n* Kangshung Glacier\n* Khumbu Glacier\n* Khumbu Icefall\n* Lhakpa La\n* Lho La\n* North Col\n* North Face\n* Norton Couloir\n* Rongbuk Glacier\n* South Col\n* South Summit\n* Three Pinnacles\n* Three Steps\n\t+ \"Green Boots cave\"\n* Western Cwm\n | ![](image)\n |\n| Expeditions | * 1921 British reconnaissance\n* 1922 British\n* 1924 British (Affair of the Dancing Lamas)\n* 1933 British aerial reconnaissance\n* 1933 British\n* 1935 British\n* 1936 British\n* 1938 British\n* 1950\u201352 British\u2013Swiss\u2013US reconnaissance\n* 1951 British\n* 1952 Swiss\n* 1953 British\n* 1960 Chinese\n* 1975 British SW Face\n* 1976 British\u2013Nepalese SW Face\n* 1979 Yugoslav West Ridge\n* 1996 Indo-Tibetan Border Police\n* 2006 Philippine\n* 2007 Altitude Everest expedition\n* Earth Day 20 International Peace Climb\n* Mallory and Irvine Research Expedition\n |\n| Notable fatalities | * Francys Arsentiev (Sleeping Beauty)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe northern approach to the mountain was discovered by George Mallory and Guy Bullock on the initial 1921 British Reconnaissance Expedition. It was an exploratory expedition not equipped for a serious attempt to climb the mountain. With Mallory leading (and thus becoming the first European to set foot on Everest's flanks) they climbed the North Col to an altitude of 7,005 metres (22,982\u00a0ft). From there, Mallory espied a route to the top, but the party was unprepared to climb any further and descended.\n\n\nThe British returned for a 1922 expedition. George Finch climbed using oxygen for the first time. He ascended at a remarkable speed\u2014290 metres (951\u00a0ft) per hour\u2014and reached an altitude of 8,320\u00a0m (27,300\u00a0ft), the first time a human reported to climb higher than 8,000 m. Mallory and Col. Felix Norton made a second unsuccessful attempt.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBecause Mount Everest is the highest mountain in the world, it has attracted considerable attention and climbing attempts. Whether the mountain was climbed in ancient times is unknown. It may have been climbed in 1924, although this has never been confirmed, as neither of the men making the attempt returned. Several climbing routes have been established over several decades of climbing expeditions to the mountain.[87][88][*better\u00a0source\u00a0needed*]\n\n\n\n### Overview[edit]\n\n\nEverest's summit is first known to have been reached by a human in 1953, and interest from climbers increased thereafter.[89] Despite the effort and attention poured into expeditions, only about 200 people had summited by 1987.[89] Everest remained a difficult climb for decades, even for serious attempts by professional climbers and large national expeditions, which were the norm until the commercial era began in the 1990s.[90]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Team member Thomas Montgomerie designated the mountain \"K2\" for being the second peak of the Karakoram range. The other peaks were originally named K1, K3, K4, and K5, but were eventually renamed Masherbrum, Gasherbrum IV, Gasherbrum II, and Gasherbrum I, respectively.[37] In 1892, Martin Conway led a British expedition that reached \"Concordia\" on the Baltoro Glacier.[38]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn 28 July 2013, two New Zealanders, Marty Schmidt and his son Denali, died after an avalanche destroyed their camp. A guide had reached their camp, but said they were nowhere to be seen and the campsite tent showed signs of having been hit by an avalanche. British climber Adrian Hayes, who was with the group, later posted on his Facebook page that the campsite had been wiped out.[68]\n2014\nOn 26 July 2014, the first team of Pakistani climbers scaled K2. There were six Pakistani and three Italian climbers in the expedition, called K2 60 Years Later, according to BBC. Previously, K2 had only been summited by individual Pakistanis as part of international expeditions.[69] Another team, consisting of Pasang Lhamu Sherpa Akita, Maya Sherpa, and Dawa Yangzum Sherpa, became the first Nepali women to climb K2.[70]\nOn 27 July 2014, Garrett Madison led a team of three American climbers and six Sherpas to summit K2.[71][72]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn 31 July 2014, Boyan Petrov completed the first Bulgarian ascent, just 8 days after climbing Broad Peak. Boyan is among the very few climbers with diabetes to climb above 7,000 metres (23,000\u00a0ft) without the use of supplemental oxygen.[73]\n2017\nOn 28 July 2017, Vanessa O'Brien led an international team of 12 with Mingma Gyalje Sherpa of Dreamers Destination to the summit of K2 and became the first British and American woman to summit K2, and the eldest woman to summit K2 at the age of 52 years old.[74] She paid tribute to Julie Tullis and Alison Hargreaves, two British women who summited K2, in 1986 and 1995 respectively, but died during their descents. Other notable summits included John Snorri Sigurj\u00f3nsson and Dawa Gyalje Sherpa who joined his sister (Dawa Yangzum Sherpa), becoming the second set of siblings to summit K2.[75] Both Mingma Gyalje Sherpa and Fazal Ali recorded their second K2 summits.[*citation needed*]\n2018\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe standard route of ascent, used by 75% of all climbers, is the Abruzzi Spur,[102][103] located on the Pakistani side, first attempted by Prince Luigi Amedeo, Duke of the Abruzzi in 1909. This is the peak's southeast ridge, rising above the Godwin-Austen Glacier. The spur proper begins at an altitude of 5,400 metres (17,700\u00a0ft), where Advanced Base Camp is usually placed. The route follows an alternating series of rock ribs, snow/ice fields, and some technical rock climbing on two famous features, \"House's Chimney\" and the \"Black Pyramid.\" Above the Black Pyramid, dangerously exposed and difficult-to-navigate slopes lead to the easily visible \"Shoulder\", and thence to the summit. The last major obstacle is a narrow couloir known as the \"Bottleneck\", which places climbers dangerously close to a wall of seracs that form an ice cliff to the east of the summit. It was partly due to the collapse of one of these seracs around 2001 that no climbers reached the summit in 2002 and 2003.[104]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* 2021\u00a0\u2014 Ten climbers from an international expedition made the first winter summit on 16 January 2021. The group all summited together, and consisted of Mingma Gyalje Sherpa, Nirmal Purja, Gelje Sherpa, Mingma David Sherpa, Mingma Tenzi Sherpa, Dawa Temba Sherpa, Pem Chhiri Sherpa, Kilu Pemba Sherpa, Dawa Tenjing Sherpa, and Sona Sherpa. The summiting group consisted entirely of indigenous climbers from Nepal. Nirmal Purja was the only one who reached the summit without the use of supplemental oxygen. The summit temperature was \u221240\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221240\u00a0\u00b0F). On the same day Spanish team member Sergi Mingote died on the descent from Camp III; he fell somewhere between Camp I and Advanced Base Camp.[16][15][88][89][90][91][92][93][94] Other famous climbers who died on the same expedition include Atanas Skatov,[95][96][97] Ali Sadpara, John Snorri, and Juan Pablo Mohr Prieto.[98][99]\n\n\n## Climbing routes and difficulties[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

They failed because of poor weather and snow conditions.[16]\n* In 1931, Paul Bauer led a second German expedition team who attempted the northeast spur before being turned back by bad weather, illnesses and deaths. The team, including Peter Aufschnaiter, retreated after climbing 300 m higher than the 1929 attempt.[38]\n* In 1954, John Kempe led a party comprising J. W. Tucker, S. R. Jackson, G. C. Lewis, T. H. Braham and medical officer D. S. Mathews. They explored the upper Yalung glacier with the intention to discover a practicable route to the great ice-shelf that runs across the southwest face of Kangchenjunga.[39] This reconnaissance led to the route used by the successful 1955 expedition.[40]\n\n\n### First ascent[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 1955 British Kangchenjunga expedition\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* In 1899, British mountaineer Douglas Freshfield set out with his party comprising the Italian photographer Vittorio Sella. They were the first mountaineers to examine the lower and upper ramparts, and the great western face of Kangchenjunga, rising from the Kangchenjunga Glacier.[3]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nUntil 1852, Kangchenjunga was assumed to be the highest mountain in the world, but calculations and measurements by the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India in 1849 showed that Mount Everest, known as Peak XV at the time, is actually higher. After allowing for further verification of all calculations, it was officially announced in 1856 that Kangchenjunga was the third-highest mountain.[6]\n\n\nThe Kangchenjunga is a sacred mountain in Nepal and Sikkim and was first climbed on 25 May 1955 by Joe Brown and George Band, who were part of the 1955 British Kangchenjunga expedition. They stopped just short of the true summit, keeping a promise given to Tashi Namgyal, the Chogyal of Sikkim, that the top of the mountain would remain inviolate.[7] The Indian side of the mountain is off-limits to climbers. In 2016, the adjoining Khangchendzonga National Park was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe ascent proved that Aleister Crowley's 1905 route (also investigated by the 1954 reconnaissance) was viable. The route starts on the Yalung Glacier to the southwest of the peak, and climbs the Yalung Face, which is 3,000 metres (10,000\u00a0ft) high. The main feature of this face is the \"Great Shelf\", a large sloping plateau at around 7,500 metres (24,600\u00a0ft), covered by a hanging glacier. The route is almost entirely on snow, glacier and one icefall; the summit ridge itself can involve a small amount of travel on rock. The first ascent expedition made six camps above their base camp, two below the Shelf, two on it, and two above it. They started on 18 April, and everyone was back to base camp by 28 May.[41] Other members of this expedition included John Angelo Jackson and Tom Mackinnon.[42]\n\n\n\n### Other notable ascents[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* In 1907, two Norwegians set about climbing *Jongri* via the Kabru glacier to the south, an approach apparently rejected by Graham's party. Progress was very slow, partly because of problems with supplies and porters, and presumably also lack of fitness and acclimatisation. However, from a high camp at about 22,600\u00a0ft (6,900\u00a0m) they were eventually able to reach a point 50 or 60\u00a0ft (15 or 18\u00a0m) below the summit before they were turned back by strong winds.[35]\n* In 1929, the German Paul Bauer led an expedition team that reached 7,400\u00a0m (24,300\u00a0ft) on the northeast spur before being turned back by a five-day storm.[38]\n* In May 1929, the American E. F. Farmer left Darjeeling with native porters, crossed the Kang La into Nepal and climbed up towards the *Talung Saddle*. When his porters refused to go any further, he climbed alone further upwards through drifting mists but did not return.[16]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* H.W.

It is located in the Mahalangur Himalayas 19\u00a0km (12\u00a0mi) southeast of Mount Everest, on the China\u2013Nepal border. One of the eight-thousanders, Makalu is an isolated peak in the shape of a four-sided pyramid.\n\n\nMakalu has two notable subsidiary peaks. Kangchungtse, or Makalu II (7,678\u00a0m) lies about three kilometres (two miles) north-northwest of the main summit. Rising about 5\u00a0km (3\u00a0mi) north-northeast of the main summit across a broad plateau, and connected to Kangchungtse by a narrow, 7,200\u00a0m saddle, is Chomo Lonzo (7,804\u00a0m).\n\n\n\n\n## Climbing history[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMakalu was first summited on May 15, 1955, by Lionel Terray and Jean Couzy of a French expedition led by Jean Franco. Franco, Guido Magnone and Gyalzen Norbu Sherpa summitted the next day, followed by Jean Bouvier, Serge Coup\u00e9, Pierre Leroux and Andr\u00e9 Vialatte on the 17th. This was an amazing achievement at the time, to have the vast majority of expedition members summit, especially on such a difficult peak. Prior to this time, summits were reached by one to two expedition members at most, with the rest of teams providing logistical support before turning around and heading home. The French team climbed Makalu by the north face and northeast ridge, via the saddle between Makalu and Kangchungtse (the Makalu-La), establishing the standard route.[4]\n\n\nAn ascent without oxygen was attempted by the 1960-61 Silver Hut expedition but two attempts did not succeed.\n\n\n\n### Notable ascents[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Glacier on Makalu\n![](image)Makalu\n![](image)Makalu 3D\n* 1955 *North Face to Northeast Ridge* FA by Lionel Terray and Jean Couzy of France.[4]\n* 1970: *Southeast Ridge* FA of ridge attempted by the Americans in 1954,[5] was made by Y. Ozaki and A. Tanaka from Japan on May 23.[6]\n* 1971: The very technical *West Pillar* route was climbed in May by Frenchmen B. Mellet and Y. Seigneur.[4]\n* 1975: *South Face* \u2013 an expedition led by Ale\u0161 Kunaver reached the top of Makalu up its steep southern side, becoming the first Slovenes to summit an eight-thousander. The first amongst them was Stane Belak. This was the third ascent of an eight-thousand meter peak by a great mountain face and the highest peak successfully summitted without supplementary oxygen (Marjan Manfreda).[7]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* 1982\u00a0: On 10 October Polish climber Andrzej Czok ascended Makalu via West face till 8000m and north-western ridge. Camp IV was reached by two more climbers, Janusz Skorek and Andrzej Machnik, but when their first summit attempt failed, Czok decided to try one more time solo.[10]\n* 1988: Frenchman Marc Batard climbed in one day (after camps were set up) to the summit via the *West Buttress* on April 27.[11]\n* 1989: *Direct South Face*, solo new start by Frenchman Pierre Beghin to 1975 Yugoslav route.[12]\n* 1990: First female ascent, Kitty Calhoun via the West Pillar route.[13]\n* 1994: On May 15, the anniversary of the first summit, Anatoli Boukreev made a speed ascent in 46 hours.[*citation needed*]\n* 1997: After seven failed attempts between 1977 and 1996, the West face was finally ascended. A Russian expedition led by Sergey Efimov brought Alexei Bolotov, Yuri Ermachek, Dmitri Pavlenko, Igor Bugachevski and Nikolai Jiline to the summit.[14] This ascent won the 1998 Piolet d'Or.\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
