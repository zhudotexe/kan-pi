Over the next 25 years clubs sprang up all over the capital, and the majority of these teams are still thriving in the 21st century. Of those clubs currently playing in the Football League, Fulham is generally considered to be London's oldest, having been founded in 1879.[7] However, Isthmian League side Cray Wanderers is the oldest extant club in all of the Greater London area, having been founded in 1860 in St Mary Cray[8] | (then part of Kent but now in the London Borough of Bromley).\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | London's first professional club in the Football League.\n |\n| Tottenham Hotspur | Tottenham Hotspur Stadium | *62,850* | 1882\n | The only non-league team to win the FA Cup (in 1901) after the founding of the Football League. The first London club to win a European trophy, the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1963. Also, inaugural winner of the UEFA Cup/Europa League in 1972.\n |\n| West Ham United | London Stadium | *62,500* | 1895\n | Founded as Thames Ironworks. Played at the Boleyn Ground from 1904 to 2016, before moving to Stratford.\n |\n| EFL Championship (2)\n |\n| Millwall | The Den | *20,146* | 1885\n | Founded in East London on the Isle of Dogs, moved south across the river to Bermondsey in 1910.\n |\n| Queens Park Rangers | Loftus Road | *18,439* | 1882\n | The team was renamed Queens Park Rangers in 1886 after the merger of St Jude's (formed in 1884) and Christchurch Rangers (formed 1882).\n |\n| EFL League One (3)\n |\n| Charlton Athletic | The Valley | *27,111* | 1905\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHistorically, London clubs have not accumulated as many trophies as those from North West England, such as the 52 top-league English championships won by Liverpool, Manchester United, Everton and Manchester City; however, in the thirteen consecutive seasons since 2005\u201306, Arsenal, Chelsea, and Tottenham have consistently finished in the top six of the league table (92% top six finishes, after accounting for a Tottenham 8th, a Chelsea 10th and a Tottenham 11th) and are regarded as three of the Premier League's current \"big six\" alongside Liverpool, Manchester United, and Manchester City. In the two seasons immediately proceeding the start of this top six run, Arsenal and Chelsea became the first pair of London clubs to finish first and second in the top flight, with Arsenal winning in 2003\u201304, and Chelsea winning in 2004\u201305. \n</fragment>\n</document>",
