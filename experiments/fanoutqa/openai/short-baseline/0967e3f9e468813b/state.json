New York's two key demographic features are its population density and cultural diversity. The city's population density of 29,091.3 people per square mile (11,232/km2), makes it the densest of any American municipality with a population above 100,000.[23] Manhattan's population density is 74,781 people per square mile (28,872/km2), highest of any county in the United States.[24][16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n24. **^** \"Population Density\" Archived February 10, 2007, at the Wayback Machine, Geographic Information Systems - GIS of Interest.
