In 2017, she starred in Zayn's music video for the single \"Dusk Till Dawn\" featuring Sia.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and family[edit]\n\n\nBorn in London on 26 April 1985,[3] Kirke was raised in New York City.[4] She is the daughter of Simon Kirke, the former drummer of the rock bands Bad Company and Free.[5] Her mother is Lorraine Kirke (née Dellal), the owner of Geminola, a vintage boutique in New York City that supplied a number of outfits for the television series *Sex and the City*.[6] Her character Jessa wore a wedding dress from Geminola in the season finale of the first season of *Girls*; also, earlier in her career, she was featured along with her sisters in a fashion piece in *Teen Vogue* in which they wore clothing from the store.[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGrowing up in West Village, Kirke found herself accepting a number of roles on her friends' projects. Dunham asked Kirke to take on a supporting role in her debut film *Tiny Furniture*. Kirke and a number of other friends were called upon as a favour to Dunham since there was not enough money to pay professional actors.[*citation needed*] Although the film turned out to be profitable, Kirke received no payment.[24] Kirke reunited with Dunham in the HBO series *Girls*, appearing in all six seasons from 2011 to 2017 as the character Jessa Johansson. Kirke next had supporting roles in the dark comedy films *Ava's Possessions* and *The Little Hours*. In 2018, Kirke starred alongside her real-life sister Lola Kirke in Emma Forrest's film *Untogether*. The film premiered at the 2018 Tribeca Film Festival.[25]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2012–2017\n | *Girls* | Jessa Johansson\n | Main role; 53 episodes\n |\n| 2015\n | *Axe Cop* | Water Queen (voice)\n | Episode: \"The Center of the Ocean\"\n |\n| 2015\n | *The Simpsons* | Candace's Friend (voice)\n | Episode: \"Every Man's Dream\"\n |\n| 2018\n | *Maniac* | Adelaide\n | Miniseries; 5 episodes\n |\n| 2019\n | *High Maintenance* | Herself\n | Episode: \"Breathwork\"\n |\n| 2021\n | *Sex Education* | Hope Haddon\n | Main role, Season 3; 8 episodes\n |\n| 2022\n | *Conversations with Friends* | Melissa\n | Main role; 12 episodes\n |\n| 2023\n | *City on Fire* | Regan Hamilton Sweeney\n | Main role; 8 episodes\n |\n\n\n### Music videos[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n12. **^** Nate Bloom (27 April 2012). \"Jews in the News: Jews Rock Hall of Fame, A Minyan of Marvel Heroes\". *Let My People Grow*.

In 2017, she starred in Zayn's music video for the single \"Dusk Till Dawn\" featuring Sia.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and family[edit]\n\n\nBorn in London on 26 April 1985,[3] Kirke was raised in New York City.[4] She is the daughter of Simon Kirke, the former drummer of the rock bands Bad Company and Free.[5] Her mother is Lorraine Kirke (née Dellal), the owner of Geminola, a vintage boutique in New York City that supplied a number of outfits for the television series *Sex and the City*.[6] Her character Jessa wore a wedding dress from Geminola in the season finale of the first season of *Girls*; also, earlier in her career, she was featured along with her sisters in a fashion piece in *Teen Vogue* in which they wore clothing from the store.[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGrowing up in West Village, Kirke found herself accepting a number of roles on her friends' projects. Dunham asked Kirke to take on a supporting role in her debut film *Tiny Furniture*. Kirke and a number of other friends were called upon as a favour to Dunham since there was not enough money to pay professional actors.[*citation needed*] Although the film turned out to be profitable, Kirke received no payment.[24] Kirke reunited with Dunham in the HBO series *Girls*, appearing in all six seasons from 2011 to 2017 as the character Jessa Johansson. Kirke next had supporting roles in the dark comedy films *Ava's Possessions* and *The Little Hours*. In 2018, Kirke starred alongside her real-life sister Lola Kirke in Emma Forrest's film *Untogether*. The film premiered at the 2018 Tribeca Film Festival.[25]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2012–2017\n | *Girls* | Jessa Johansson\n | Main role; 53 episodes\n |\n| 2015\n | *Axe Cop* | Water Queen (voice)\n | Episode: \"The Center of the Ocean\"\n |\n| 2015\n | *The Simpsons* | Candace's Friend (voice)\n | Episode: \"Every Man's Dream\"\n |\n| 2018\n | *Maniac* | Adelaide\n | Miniseries; 5 episodes\n |\n| 2019\n | *High Maintenance* | Herself\n | Episode: \"Breathwork\"\n |\n| 2021\n | *Sex Education* | Hope Haddon\n | Main role, Season 3; 8 episodes\n |\n| 2022\n | *Conversations with Friends* | Melissa\n | Main role; 12 episodes\n |\n| 2023\n | *City on Fire* | Regan Hamilton Sweeney\n | Main role; 8 episodes\n |\n\n\n### Music videos[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n12. **^** Nate Bloom (27 April 2012). \"Jews in the News: Jews Rock Hall of Fame, A Minyan of Marvel Heroes\". *Let My People Grow*.
