After seven years and two failed *Saturday Night Live* auditions, he was spotted in 1995 by an SNL producer while doing a Bill Clinton impression - shortly after Phil Hartman, who had portrayed Clinton, left the show. After an exclusive audition for creator and executive producer Lorne Michaels, Hammond was brought on board as a cast member and performed for 14 seasons.[8] He previously held the record for the longest consecutive tenure of any *SNL* cast member in the show's history, until he was surpassed by Kenan Thompson in 2017.[9]\n\n\nHe also holds *SNL* records for the second most impressions by a single cast member (107, as of the Zac Efron/Yeah Yeah Yeahs episode), beat only by Thompson, and also for the most times saying the show's catchphrase \"Live from New York, it's Saturday Night!\" to start the show (76 times, beating out Dana Carvey).[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1995\u20132009, 2014\u2013present\n | *Saturday Night Live* | Various (1995\u20132009); announcer (2014\u2013present)\n | 308 episodes\n |\n| 1997\n | *A Freezerburnt Christmas* | Voice\n | Television film\n |\n| 2000\n | *3rd Rock from the Sun* | Darrell Hammond\n | Episode: \"Dick'll Take Manhattan: Part 2\"\n |\n| 2001\n | *Law & Order: Special Victims Unit* | Ted Bolger\n | Episode: \"Runaway\"\n |\n| 2001\n | *Primetime Glick* | Dick Cheney | Episode: \"Kathie Lee Gifford/Dick Cheney\"\n |\n| 2005\n | *Law & Order: Criminal Intent* | Leonard Timmons\n | Episode: \"No Exit\"\n |\n| 2005\n | *Starved* | Josh\n | Episode: \"3D\"\n |\n| 2005\n | *Las Vegas* | Ben Carlson / Carlos / Ted Waters\n | Episode: \"Double Down, Triple Threat\"\n |\n| 2009\n | *Damages* | The Deacon\n | 7 episodes\n |\n| 2012\n | *Are We There Yet?* | Brick Street\n | 6 episodes\n |\n| 2014\n | *Deadbeat* | Don Soderbergh\n | Episode: \"The Knockoff\"\n |\n| 2016\n | *Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt* | Announcer\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nUpon his departure from the cast in 2009, Hammond, at age 53, was the oldest cast member in the show's history.

Hammond found as a child that doing impressions was the only thing he did his mother liked.[5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
