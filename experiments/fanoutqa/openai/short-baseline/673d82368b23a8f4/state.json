LaGuardia High School) as specialized high schools of New York City. The act called for a uniform exam to be administered for admission to Brooklyn Tech, Bronx Science, and Stuyvesant.[27] The exam, named the Specialized High Schools Admissions Test (SHSAT), tested the mathematical and verbal abilities of students who were applying to any of the specialized high schools. The only exception was for applicants to LaGuardia High School, who were accepted by audition rather than examination.[27]\n\n\n\n#### September 11 attacks[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nNew York City Department of Education\n |\n| --- |\n| * Panel for Educational Policy\n* Public Schools Athletic League\n* Tweed Courthouse\n* New York City School Construction Authority\n* Specialized High Schools Admissions Test\n |\n| Schools | * List of public elementary schools\n* List of high schools in The Bronx\n* List of high schools in Brooklyn\n* List of high schools in Manhattan\n* List of high schools in Queens\n* List of high schools in Staten Island\n* School of One\n* Empowerment Schools\n |\n| Specializedhigh schools | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| The Bronx | * Bronx HS of Science\n* HS of American Studies at Lehman College\n |\n| Brooklyn | * Brooklyn Latin\n* Brooklyn Technical HS\n |\n| Manhattan | * Fiorello H.

They were given use of an antiquated Gothic-gargoyled edifice located at Creston Avenue and 184th Street, in the Fordham Road-Grand Concourse area of the Bronx. The building, built in 1918 for Evander Childs High School, had been successively occupied by Walton High School (1930) and by an annex of DeWitt Clinton High School (1935).

The exam would become known as the Specialized High Schools Admissions Test (SHSAT) and tested students in Math and English. With its statewide recognition, the school had to become co-educational.
