Kennedy later said he thought Hoover had enjoyed telling him the news.[203] Kennedy then received a call from Tazewell Shepard, a naval aide to the president, who told him that his brother was dead.[202] Shortly after the call from Hoover, Kennedy phoned McGeorge Bundy at the White House, instructing him to change the locks on the president's files. He ordered the Secret Service to dismantle the hidden taping system in the Oval Office and cabinet room. He scheduled a meeting with CIA director John McCone and asked if the CIA had any involvement in his brother's death. McCone denied it, with Kennedy later telling investigator Walter Sheridan that he asked the director \"in a way that he couldn't lie to me, and they [the CIA] hadn't\".[204]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_GqpHOkRiUGCWndhuht64joPI","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

Clay.[184]\n\n\n\n### Cuba[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe 15-minute ceremony began at 10:30 p.m. Cardinal Patrick O'Boyle, Roman Catholic Archbishop of Washington, officiated at the graveside service in lieu of Cardinal Richard Cushing of Boston, who fell ill during the trip.[373] Also officiating was Archbishop of New York Terence Cooke.[371] On behalf of the United States, John Glenn presented the folded flag to Ted Kennedy, who passed it to Robert's eldest son, Joe, who passed it to Ethel Kennedy. The Navy Band played *The Navy Hymn*.[371]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWhen President Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas on November 22, 1963, RFK was at home with aides from the Justice Department. J. Edgar Hoover called and told him his brother had been shot.[202] Hoover then hung up before he could ask any questions. Kennedy later said he thought Hoover had enjoyed telling him the news.[203] Kennedy then received a call from Tazewell Shepard, a naval aide to the president, who told him that his brother was dead.[202] Shortly after the call from Hoover, Kennedy phoned McGeorge Bundy at the White House, instructing him to change the locks on the president's files. He ordered the Secret Service to dismantle the hidden taping system in the Oval Office and cabinet room. He scheduled a meeting with CIA director John McCone and asked if the CIA had any involvement in his brother's death. McCone denied it, with Kennedy later telling investigator Walter Sheridan that he asked the director \"in a way that he couldn't lie to me, and they [the CIA] hadn't\".[204]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_GqpHOkRiUGCWndhuht64joPI","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
