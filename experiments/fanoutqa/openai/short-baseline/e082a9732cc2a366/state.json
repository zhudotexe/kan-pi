          "content": "<document>\n<title>Prices of chemical elements</title>\n<fragment>\n\nAs of 2020[update], the most expensive non-synthetic element by both mass and volume is rhodium. It is followed by caesium, iridium and palladium by mass and iridium, gold and platinum by volume. Of those elements, rhodium, caesium and gold have only one stable isotope (133  \nCs, 103  \nRh and 197  \nAu respectively), iridium has two (191  \nIr and 193  \n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIr) whereas palladium and platinum both have several. Carbon in the form of diamond can be more expensive than rhodium. Per-kilogram prices of some synthetic radioisotopes range to trillions of dollars. While the difficulty of obtaining macroscopic samples of synthetic elements in part explains their high value, there has been interest in converting base metals to gold (Chrysopoeia) since ancient times, but only deeper understanding of nuclear physics has allowed the actual production of a tiny amount of gold from other elements for research purposes as demonstrated by Glenn Seaborg.[1][2] However, both this and other routes of synthesis of precious metals via nuclear reactions is orders of magnitude removed from economic viability.\n\n\nChlorine, sulfur and carbon (as coal) are cheapest by mass. Hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen and chlorine are cheapest by volume at atmospheric pressure.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n7. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** ***k*** ***l*** ***m*** ***n*** ***o*** ***p*** ***q*** ***r*** ***s*** ***t*** ***u*** ***v*** ***w*** ***x*** ***y*** ***z*** ***aa*** ***ab*** ***ac*** ***ad*** ***ae*** Price average for entire year 2019.\n8. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** Market price on 4 February 2020\n9. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** This element is transient \u2013 it occurs only through decay (and in the case of plutonium, also in traces deposited from supernovae onto Earth).\n10. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** or earlier\n11. **^** The values reported are present in 85th edition of *CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics*[44] (and possibly earlier) and remain unchanged to at least 97th edition.[45]\n12. **^** Source lists prices of other rare earth elements (some of which are significantly different than the ones presented in table above):\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSee also: Diamonds as an investment\n\nSee also: Scandium \u00a7\u00a0Price\n\nSee also: Rhodium \u00a7\u00a0Mining and price\n\nSee also: Palladium as an investment\n\nSee also: Silver as an investment\n\nSee also: Tin \u00a7\u00a0Price\\_and\\_exchanges\n\nSee also: Iridium \u00a7\u00a0Production\n\nSee also: Platinum as an investment\n\nSee also: Gold as an investment\n\nSee also: Bismuth \u00a7\u00a0Price\n\nSee also: Uranium market\n\n\nThis is a list of **prices of chemical elements**.

However, both teams published in 2004.\n |\n| 117\n | Tennessine | 2009\n | Y. Oganessian et al.

Gregor | 1825\n | J. Berzelius | Gregor found an oxide of a new metal in ilmenite; Klaproth independently discovered the element in rutile in 1795 and named it. The pure metallic form was only obtained in 1910 by Matthew A. Hunter.[85][86] |\n| 39\n | Yttrium | 1794\n | J. Gadolin | 1843\n | H. Rose | Johan Gadolin discovered the earth in gadolinite in 1794. He did not name his discovery, but Andreas Ekeberg did so when he confirmed it in 1797.[5] Mosander showed later that its ore, yttria, contained more elements.[87][88] In 1808, Davy showed that yttria is a metallic oxide, although he could not isolate the metal.[89][90] W\u00f6hler mistakenly thought he had isolated the metal in 1828 from a volatile chloride he supposed to be yttrium chloride,[91][92] but Rose proved otherwise in 1843 and correctly isolated the element himself that year.\n |\n| 24\n | Chromium | 1797\n | N.
