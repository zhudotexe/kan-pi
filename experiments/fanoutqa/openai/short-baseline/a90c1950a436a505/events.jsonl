In 2007, residents in the top twelve percent of GDP per capita holders in the city had a mean disposable income of US$98,517. The high spending power of Mexico City inhabitants makes the city attractive for companies offering prestige and luxury goods. According to a 2009 study conducted by PwC, Mexico City had a GDP of $390 billion, ranking it as the eighth richest city in the world and the richest in Latin America.[164] In 2009, Mexico City alone would rank as the 30th largest economy in the world.[165]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n106. **^** Lafregua, J; Gutierrez, A; Aguilar E; Aparicio J; Mejia R; Santillan O; Suarez MA; Preciado M (2003). \"Balance hídrico del Valle de Mexico\" (PDF).

The city proper produces 15.8% of the country's gross domestic product.[162] In 2002, Mexico City had a Human Development Index score of 0.915,[163] identical to that of South Korea. In 2007, residents in the top twelve percent of GDP per capita holders in the city had a mean disposable income of US$98,517. The high spending power of Mexico City inhabitants makes the city attractive for companies offering prestige and luxury goods. According to a 2009 study conducted by PwC, Mexico City had a GDP of $390 billion, ranking it as the eighth richest city in the world and the richest in Latin America.[164] In 2009, Mexico City alone would rank as the 30th largest economy in the world.[165]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n106. **^** Lafregua, J; Gutierrez, A; Aguilar E; Aparicio J; Mejia R; Santillan O; Suarez MA; Preciado M (2003). \"Balance hídrico del Valle de Mexico\" (PDF).
