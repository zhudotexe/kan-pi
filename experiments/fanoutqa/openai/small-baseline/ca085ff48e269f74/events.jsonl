Grover Cleveland was both the 22nd president and the 24th president because his two terms were not consecutive.

Roosevelt served the longest, over twelve years, before dying early in his fourth term in 1945. He is the only U.S. president to have served more than two terms.[8] Since the ratification of the Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1951, no person may be elected president more than twice, and no one who has served more than two years of a term to which someone else was elected may be elected more than once.[9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n3. **^** Political parties had not been anticipated when the Constitution was drafted, nor did they exist at the time of the first presidential election in 1788–89. When they did develop, during Washington's first term, Adams joined the faction that became the Federalist Party. The elections of 1792 were the first ones in the United States that were contested on anything resembling a partisan basis.[18]\n4. **^** The 1796 presidential election was the first contested American presidential election and the only one in which a president and vice president were elected from opposing political parties. Federalist John Adams was elected president, and Jefferson of the Democratic-Republicans was elected vice president.[20]\n5. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** ***k*** ***l*** ***m*** ***n*** ***o*** Died in office[23]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n30.

The Constitution is silent on the issue of political parties, and at the time it came into force in 1789, no organized parties existed. Soon after the 1st Congress convened, political factions began rallying around dominant Washington administration officials, such as Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson.[12] Concerned about the capacity of political parties to destroy the fragile unity holding the nation together, Washington remained unaffiliated with any political faction or party throughout his eight-year presidency. He was, and remains, the only U.S. president never affiliated with a political party.[13]\n\n\n\n\n## Presidents[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n2004\n | Dick Cheney |\n| 44 | ![Photographic portrait of Barack Obama](image) | **Barack Obama**(b. 1961)[73] | January 20, 2009–January 20, 2017 |  | Democratic | 2008\n\n\n---\n\n\n2012\n | Joe Biden |\n| 45 | ![Photographic portrait of Donald Trump](image) | **Donald Trump**(b. 1946)[74] | January 20, 2017–January 20, 2021 |  | Republican | 2016 | Mike Pence |\n| 46 | ![Photographic portrait of Joe Biden](image) | **Joe Biden**(b. 1942)[6] | January 20, 2021–*Incumbent* |  | Democratic | 2020 | Kamala Harris |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Acting President of the United States\n* Founding Fathers of the United States\n* President of the Continental Congress\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n10. **^** John Tyler was elected vice president on the Whig Party ticket in 1840.

Upon the resignation of 37th president, Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford became the 38th president even though he simply served out the remainder of Nixon's second term and was never elected to the presidency in his own right. Grover Cleveland was both the 22nd president and the 24th president because his two terms were not consecutive. A vice president who temporarily becomes acting president under the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the Constitution is not counted, because the president remains in office during such a period.\n2. **^** Reflects the president's political party at the start of their presidency.

Roosevelt served the longest, over twelve years, before dying early in his fourth term in 1945. He is the only U.S. president to have served more than two terms.[8] Since the ratification of the Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1951, no person may be elected president more than twice, and no one who has served more than two years of a term to which someone else was elected may be elected more than once.[9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n3. **^** Political parties had not been anticipated when the Constitution was drafted, nor did they exist at the time of the first presidential election in 1788–89. When they did develop, during Washington's first term, Adams joined the faction that became the Federalist Party. The elections of 1792 were the first ones in the United States that were contested on anything resembling a partisan basis.[18]\n4. **^** The 1796 presidential election was the first contested American presidential election and the only one in which a president and vice president were elected from opposing political parties. Federalist John Adams was elected president, and Jefferson of the Democratic-Republicans was elected vice president.[20]\n5. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** ***k*** ***l*** ***m*** ***n*** ***o*** Died in office[23]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n30.

The Constitution is silent on the issue of political parties, and at the time it came into force in 1789, no organized parties existed. Soon after the 1st Congress convened, political factions began rallying around dominant Washington administration officials, such as Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson.[12] Concerned about the capacity of political parties to destroy the fragile unity holding the nation together, Washington remained unaffiliated with any political faction or party throughout his eight-year presidency. He was, and remains, the only U.S. president never affiliated with a political party.[13]\n\n\n\n\n## Presidents[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n2004\n | Dick Cheney |\n| 44 | ![Photographic portrait of Barack Obama](image) | **Barack Obama**(b. 1961)[73] | January 20, 2009–January 20, 2017 |  | Democratic | 2008\n\n\n---\n\n\n2012\n | Joe Biden |\n| 45 | ![Photographic portrait of Donald Trump](image) | **Donald Trump**(b. 1946)[74] | January 20, 2017–January 20, 2021 |  | Republican | 2016 | Mike Pence |\n| 46 | ![Photographic portrait of Joe Biden](image) | **Joe Biden**(b. 1942)[6] | January 20, 2021–*Incumbent* |  | Democratic | 2020 | Kamala Harris |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Acting President of the United States\n* Founding Fathers of the United States\n* President of the Continental Congress\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n10. **^** John Tyler was elected vice president on the Whig Party ticket in 1840.
