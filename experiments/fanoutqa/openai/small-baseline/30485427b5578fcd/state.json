The GDP dollar estimates presented here are calculated at market or government official exchange rates. The figures presented here do not take into account differences in the cost of living in different countries, and the results can vary greatly from one year to another based on fluctuations in the exchange rates of the country's currency. Such fluctuations may change a continents ranking from one year to the next, even though they often make little or no difference to the standard of living of its population. Therefore, these figures should be used with caution. Comparisons of national wealth are also frequently made on the basis of purchasing power parity (PPP), to adjust for differences in the cost of living in different countries. (*See* List of countries by GDP (PPP).) PPP largely removes the exchange rate problem, but has its own drawbacks; it does not reflect the value of economic output in international trade, and it also requires more estimation than GDP per capita. On the whole, PPP per capita figures are more narrowly spread than nominal GDP per capita figures.\n\n\n\n\n## Continents by GDP (nominal)[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of countries by GDP (nominal)\n\nThe following lists summarise the GDP (nominal) of each continent by adding GDP (nominal) of each nation within the seven continent model, sorted by USD. The first list includes 2023 data estimatesn1 for members of the International Monetary Fund. The second list shows the World Bank's estimates, and the third list includes mostly 1432 estimates from the CIA World Factbook.\n\n\nIn these lists, the sovereign states and dependent territories are classified according to the geoscheme created by the United Nations Statistics Division.[1] According to the UN, the assignment of countries or areas to specific groupings is for statistical convenience and does not imply any assumption regarding political or other affiliation of countries or territories.[2]\n\n\nFor more information, please see List of sovereign states and dependent territories by continent.\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **List by the International Monetary Fund (2023 estimate)**[3] |\n| \n\n| Rank | Continent | GDP(US$billion) | Share (%) | Countries collectivelyconstituting at least 50.0% of thecontinent's GDP (nominal) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | *World* | 104,476 | 100.0 |  |\n| 1 | Asia | 38,435 | 36.8 | ![](image)\u00a0China (48.61%)![](image)\u00a0Japan (11.06%)\n |\n| 2 | North America | 31,603 | 30.2 | ![](image)\u00a0United States (85.3%)\n |\n| 3 | Europe | 25,440 | 24.4 | ![](image)\u00a0Germany (17.4%)![](image)\u00a0United Kingdom (13.1%)![](image)\u00a0France (12.0%)![](image)\u00a0Italy (8.6%)\n |\n| 4 | South America | 4,100 | 3.9 | ![](image)\u00a0Brazil (51.9%)\n |\n| 5 | Africa | 2,858 | 2.7 | ![](image)\u00a0Egypt (13.9%)![](image)\u00a0Nigeria (13.6%)![](image)\u00a0South Africa (13.3%)![](image)\u00a0Algeria (7.8%)![](image)\u00a0Ethiopia (5.5%)\n |\n| 6 | Oceania | 1,979 | 1.9 | ![](image)\u00a0Australia (85.3%)\n |\n|  | Unaccounted | 62 | 0.1 |  |\n\n |\n|  |\n\n\n* Antarctica has no permanent population.
