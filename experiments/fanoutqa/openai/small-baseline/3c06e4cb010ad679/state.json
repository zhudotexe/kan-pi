After the founding of the PRC in 1949, Xi's father held a series of posts, including Party propaganda chief, vice-premier, and vice chairperson of the National People's Congress.[3] Xi had two older sisters, Qiaoqiao, born in 1949 and An'an (\u5b89\u5b89; *\u0100n'\u0101n*), born in 1952.[4][5] Xi's father was from Fuping County, Shaanxi, and Xi could further trace his patrilineal descent from Xiying in Dengzhou, Henan.[6][*unreliable source?*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n57. **^** Bull, Alister; Buckley, Chris (24 January 2012). \"China leader-in-waiting Xi to visit White House next month\". *Reuters*.

His tenure was characterized by collective leadership and consensus-based rule.[2] These traits made Hu a rather enigmatic figure in the public eye. His administration was known for its focus more on technocratic competence than persona.[3] At the end of his tenure after ten years in office, Hu won praise for retiring voluntarily from all positions. He was succeeded by Xi Jinping. Following the death of his predecessor Jiang Zemin, Hu is the only living former paramount leader of the People's Republic of China.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life, education, and family[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hu's birthplace, Jiangyan, Jiangsu.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n\n\n### Power transition of Xi Jinping[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 18th Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party\n\nSee also: 12th National People's Congress\n\nOn 15 November 2012, immediately after the 18th CCP National Congress, Xi was elected to the posts of general secretary of the CCP and chairman of the CMC by the 18th Central Committee, succeeding Hu.[57] On 14 March 2013, he was succeeded by Xi as president.[58]\n\n\n\n## After retirement[edit]\n\n\nSince his retirement, Hu has kept a low-profile, rarely making public appearances. In September 2013, Hu visited an ancestral family home in Huangshan, Anhui, though the trip was not covered by state media.[59] In April 2014, he made an appearance in Hunan, visiting Hunan University and other historical sites.[60] He attended the 19th CCP National Congress in October 2017.[61] He also attended the 70th anniversary of the People's Republic of China in October 2019, and the 100th anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party in July 2021.[62]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n59. **^** Boehler, Patrick (13 September 2023). \"Social media records rare public appearance of former president Hu Jintao\". *South China Morning Post*.

Bush with his wife in Crawford, Texas, 25 October 2002\nIn the run-up to the 16th National Congress of the CCP, Hu Jintao had \"almost unanimous support\" to become the new CCP general secretary.[77] To maintain China's image as a stable and respected country, Jiang and Hu emphasized their unity, striving to make this transition the first \"smooth and harmonious\" one in the PRC's history.[78][79] Jiang stepped down as general secretary and left the Politburo Standing Committee, but retained the chairmanship of the Central Military Commission,[80] which controlled the army and the nation's foreign policy.[81] Jiang would continue conselling Hu from \"behind the curtain\", and it was formally agreed that Jiang would be \"consulted on all matters of state importance\".[81] Both men also reached a \"tacit understanding\" that Hu would not be considered a \"core\" leader like Jiang, Deng and Mao.[82]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nUnder Jiang's leadership, China experienced substantial economic growth with the continuation of market reforms. The returning of Hong Kong from the United Kingdom in 1997 and of Macau from Portugal in 1999, and entry into the World Trade Organization in 2001, were landmark moments of his era.[3] China also witnessed improved relations with the outside world, while the Communist Party maintained its tight control over the state. Jiang faced criticism over human rights abuses, including the crackdown on the Falun Gong movement. His contributions to party doctrine, known as the \"Three Represents\", were written into the CCP constitution in 2002. Jiang gradually vacated his official leadership titles from 2002 to 2005, being succeeded in these roles by Hu Jintao, although he and his political faction continued to influence affairs until much later. In 2022, Jiang died in Shanghai.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Although according to the 1982 Constitution the role of President was \"largely ceremonial\", it recognized Li's status as a respected Party elder and a member of the CCP Politburo Standing Committee, and Li himself went on to forcefully use his still very substantial influence to support leftist policies. In 1984, Li met with U.S. President Ronald Reagan during the latter's visit to China, notably discussing the status of Taiwan with the President.[10] Li visited the United States in July 1985, the first time the head of state of the People's Republic of China made such a visit.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nVice Premiers of the People's Republic of China (list)\n |\n| --- |\n| Provisional Cabinet | 1.

Li stepped down as president in 1988 and was succeeded by Yang Shangkun. Li was then named Chairman of the National Committee of the CPPCC. He was a strong supporter of Jiang Zemin's rise to power,[*citation needed*] and during the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, Li was one of the hardline Party elders who pushed for a strong response to the demonstrations and supported Premier Li Peng's desire to use military force to suppress the protests.[5][11][12] Li continued to serve in government until his death in 1992.\n\n\n\n## Family[edit]\n\n\nLi had four children. His youngest daughter, Li Xiaolin, is the President of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries.
