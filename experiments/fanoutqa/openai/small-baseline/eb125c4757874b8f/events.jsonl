After selling out the first issue, Gannett gradually expanded the national distribution of the paper, reaching an estimated circulation of 362,879 copies by the end of 1982, double the amount of sales that Gannett projected.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n*USA Today* was first conceived on February 29, 1980, when a company task force known as \"Project NN\" met with then-chairman of Gannett, Al Neuharth, in Cocoa Beach, Florida. Early regional prototypes of *USA Today* included *East Bay Today*, an Oakland, California-based publication published in the late 1970s to serve as the morning edition of the *Oakland Tribune*, an afternoon newspaper which Gannett owned at the time.[13] On June 11, 1981, Gannett printed the first prototypes of the proposed publication. The two proposed design layouts were mailed to newsmakers and prominent leaders in journalism for review and feedback.[8][14] Gannett's board of directors approved the launch of the national newspaper, titled *USA Today*, on December 5, 1981. At launch, Neuharth was appointed president and publisher of the newspaper, adding those responsibilities to his existing position as Gannett's chief executive officer.[14][15]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n***USA Today*** (often stylized in all caps[5]) is an American daily middle-market newspaper and news broadcasting company. Founded by Al Neuharth on September 15, 1982, the newspaper operates from Gannett's corporate headquarters in Tysons, Virginia.[6] Its newspaper is printed at 37 sites across the United States and at five additional sites internationally. The paper's dynamic design influenced the style of local, regional, and national newspapers worldwide through its use of concise reports, colorized images, informational graphics, and inclusion of popular culture stories, among other distinct features.[7][8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBy the fourth quarter of 1985, *USA Today* had become the second-largest newspaper in the United States, reaching a daily circulation of 1.4 million copies. Total daily readership of the paper by 1987 (according to Simmons Market Research Bureau statistics) had reached 5.5 million, the largest of any daily newspaper in the U.S. On May 6, 1986, *USA Today* began production of its international edition in Switzerland. *USA Today* operated at a loss for most of its first four years of operation, accumulating a total deficit of $233 million after taxes, according to figures released by Gannett in July 1987; the newspaper began turning its first profit in May 1987, six months ahead of Gannett corporate revenue projections.[14]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWith an average print circulation of 159,233 as of 2022,[update][9] a digital-only subscriber base of 504,000 as of 2019,[update][10] and an approximate daily readership of 2.6 million,[5] *USA Today* has the largest circulation of any newspaper in the United States. It has been shown to maintain a generally center-left audience, in regards to political persuasion.[11] *USA Today* is distributed in all 50 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, and an international edition is distributed in Asia, Canada, Europe, and the Pacific Islands.[12]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **contains content that is written like an advertisement**.

Their children enjoyed both profits and influence, but as the families grew larger, the later generations found that only one or two branches got the power, and everyone else got a share of the money. Eventually the coupon-clipping branches realized that they could make more money investing in something other than newspapers.

Otis Chandler sought legitimacy and recognition for his family's paper, often forgotten in the power centers of the Northeastern United States due to its geographic and cultural distance. He sought to remake the paper in the model of the nation's most respected newspapers, such as *The New York Times* and *The Washington Post*. Believing that the newsroom was \"the heartbeat of the business\",[16] Otis Chandler increased the size and pay of the reporting staff and expanded its national and international reporting. In 1962, the paper joined with *The Washington Post* to form the Los Angeles Times–Washington Post News Service to syndicate articles from both papers for other news organizations. He also toned down the unyielding conservatism that had characterized the paper over the years, adopting a much more centrist editorial stance.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n89. **^** \"December 1903: Hearst's Examiner comes to L.A\".

Their children enjoyed both profits and influence, but as the families grew larger, the later generations found that only one or two branches got the power, and everyone else got a share of the money. Eventually the coupon-clipping branches realized that they could make more money investing in something other than newspapers. Under their pressure the companies went public, or split apart, or disappeared.

Otis Chandler sought legitimacy and recognition for his family's paper, often forgotten in the power centers of the Northeastern United States due to its geographic and cultural distance. He sought to remake the paper in the model of the nation's most respected newspapers, such as *The New York Times* and *The Washington Post*. Believing that the newsroom was \"the heartbeat of the business\",[16] Otis Chandler increased the size and pay of the reporting staff and expanded its national and international reporting. In 1962, the paper joined with *The Washington Post* to form the Los Angeles Times–Washington Post News Service to syndicate articles from both papers for other news organizations. He also toned down the unyielding conservatism that had characterized the paper over the years, adopting a much more centrist editorial stance.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n89. **^** \"December 1903: Hearst's Examiner comes to L.A\".
