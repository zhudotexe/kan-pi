Between 1994 and 1997, wider forums for regional cooperation between NATO and its neighbors were set up, including the Partnership for Peace, the Mediterranean Dialogue initiative, and the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council.\n\n\nAll members have militaries, except for Iceland, which does not have a typical army (but it does have a coast guard and a small unit of civilian specialists for NATO operations). Three of NATO's members are nuclear weapons states: France, the United Kingdom, and the United States. NATO has 12\u00a0original founding member states. Three more members joined between 1952 and 1955, and a fourth joined in 1982. After the end of the Cold War, NATO added 15\u00a0more members from 1999 to 2023.[2]\n\n\n\nNATO currently recognizes Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Sweden, and Ukraine as aspiring members as part of their Open Doors enlargement policy.[3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n19. **^** The pie chart format does not allow as many slices as there are countries in NATO, so the countries with the fewest military personnel per capita (Albania, Belgium, Czech Republic, Iceland and Luxembourg) have been combined into a single slice.\n20. **^** Gross domestic product (nominal) data (in billions of US dollars) is based on an April 2023 issue of the *World Economic Outlook*, which is published by the International Monetary Fund.[27]\n21. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Defence expenditure and personnel data are based on a June 2019 press release from NATO.[28]\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCurrent membership consists of 31\u00a0countries. In addition to the 12\u00a0founding countries, four new members joined during the Cold War: Greece and Turkey (1952), West Germany (1955) and Spain (1982). In 1990, the territory of the former East Germany was added with the reunification of Germany. NATO further expanded after the Cold War, adding the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland (1999), Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia (2004), Albania and Croatia (2009), Montenegro (2017), North Macedonia (2020), and Finland (2023).[4] Of the territories and members added between 1990 and 2023, all were either formerly part of the Warsaw Pact (including the formerly Soviet Baltic states) or territories of the former Yugoslavia except for Finland. No countries have left NATO since its founding.\n\n\nCurrently, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization now covers a total area of 27,131,087\u00a0km2 (10,475,371\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), since the accession of Finland on 4 April 2023.\n\n\n\n### Membership aspirations[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs of April\u00a02023[update], four additional states have formally informed NATO of their membership aspirations: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Sweden and Ukraine.[3]\n\n\n\n* NATO members agreed at the 2008 Bucharest Summit that Georgia and Ukraine \"will become members of NATO in the future\".[7]\n* Bosnia and Herzegovina was invited by NATO to join the Membership Action Plan (MAP) in April 2010.[7]\n* In May 2022, Finland and Sweden simultaneously submitted official application letters to become NATO members.[8][9]\n\t+ Finland became a member on April 4, 2023.\n\t+ As of July 10, 2023, all members except Hungary and Turkey had ratified Sweden's accession protocol, with both committing to complete their approval by October.[10]\n\n\n## List of member states[edit]\n\n\nThe current members and their dates of admission are listed below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)NATO member states as of 2023.\nNATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) is an international military alliance consisting of 31 member states from Europe and North America. It was established at the signing of the North Atlantic Treaty on 4 April 1949. Article\u00a05 of the treaty states that if an armed attack occurs against one of the member states, it shall be considered an attack against all members, and other members shall assist the attacked member, with armed forces if necessary.[1] Article\u00a06 of the treaty limits the scope of Article\u00a05 to the islands north of the Tropic of Cancer, the North American and European mainlands, the entirety of Turkey, and French Algeria, the last of which is moot. Thus, an attack on Hawaii, Puerto Rico, French Guiana, the Falkland Islands, Ceuta or Melilla, among other places, would not trigger an Article\u00a05 response.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n6. **^** \"03.

The response to whether their country should militarily aid another NATO country if it were to get into a serious military conflict with Russia was also mixed. Roughly half or fewer in six of the eight countries surveyed say their country should use military force if Russia attacks a neighboring country that is a NATO ally. And at least half in three of the eight NATO countries say that their government should not use military force in such circumstances. The strongest opposition to responding with armed force is in Germany (58%), followed by France (53%) and Italy (51%). More than half of Americans (56%) and Canadians (53%) are willing to respond to Russian military aggression against a fellow NATO country. A plurality of the British (49%) and Poles (48%) would also live up to their Article\u00a05 commitment. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Flag | Map | Name | Capital\n | Date ofAccession[11] | Popu\u00adlation[a] | Area[13] | Military budgetas %GDP 2020[14] | GDP(2020 USD)[15] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | Albania | Tirana | 1 April 2009 | 002,793,385 | 28,748\u00a0km211,100\u00a0sq\u00a0mi | 1.5 | 15,131,866,271\n |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | Belgium | Brussels | 24 August 1949[b] | 011,778,842 | 30,528\u00a0km211,787\u00a0sq\u00a0mi | 1.1 | 521,676,942,135\n |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | Bulgaria | Sofia | 29 March 2004 | 006,919,180 | 110,879\u00a0km242,811\u00a0sq\u00a0mi | 1.8 | 69,889,347,433\n |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | Canada | Ottawa | 24 August 1949[b] | 038,943,231 | 9,984,670\u00a0km23,855,103\u00a0sq\u00a0mi | 1.4 | 1,645,423,407,568\n |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | Croatia | Zagreb | 1 April 2009 | 003,901,833 | 56,594\u00a0km221,851\u00a0sq\u00a0mi | 1.8 | 79,163,000,000\n |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | Czech Republic[c] | Prague | 12 March 1999 | 010,702,596 | 78,867\u00a0km230,451\u00a0sq\u00a0mi | 1.4 | 245,339,322,067\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNumbers of military personnel\n| Country[21] | Active\n | Reserve | Para\u00admili\u00adtary | Total\n | Per 1,000 capita\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| total | active\n |\n| ![Albania](image) | Albania | 10,500\n | 0\n | 500\n | 11,000\n | 3.6\n | 3.4\n |\n| ![Belgium](image) | Belgium | 29,400\n | 5,900\n | 0\n | 35,300\n | 3\n | 2.5\n |\n| ![Bulgaria](image) | Bulgaria | 42,663\n | 3,000\n | 0\n | 45,663\n | 6.6\n | 6.2\n |\n| ![Canada](image) | Canada | 70,500\n | 35,600\n | 5,500\n | 111,600\n | 2.9\n | 1.9\n |\n| ![Croatia](image) | Croatia | 16,700\n | 21,000\n | 3,000\n | 40,700\n | 9.7\n | 4\n |\n| ![Czech Republic](image) | Czech Republic | 27,400\n | 4,200\n | 0\n | 31,600\n | 3\n | 2.6\n |\n| ![Denmark](image) | Denmark | 20,440\n | 45,800\n | 0\n | 66,240\n | 11.2\n | 3.5\n |\n| ![Estonia](image) | Estonia | 7,600\n | 230,000\n | 15,800\n | 253,400\n | 207.7\n | 6.2\n |\n| ![Finland](image) | Finland | 24,250\n | 900,000\n | 14,321\n | 938,571\n | 168.7\n | 4.4\n |\n| ![France](image) | France | 208,750\n | 141,050\n | 175,050\n | 524,850\n | 7.7\n | 3.1\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe defence spending of the United States is more than double the defence spending of all other NATO members combined.[22] Criticism of the fact that many member states were not contributing their fair share in accordance with the international agreement by then US\u00a0president Donald Trump caused various reactions from American and European political figures, ranging from ridicule to panic.[23][24][25]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nTotal Military budget of European NATO countries (excluding Turkey) as a percentage of US military budget.

France remains the only NATO member outside the Nuclear Planning Group and unlike the United States and the United Kingdom, will not commit its nuclear-armed submarines to the alliance.[19][20]\n\n\n\n## Military personnel[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Comparison of military personnel per 1,000\u00a0capita.\n |\n| 50\n\n\n100\n\n\n150\n\n\n200\n\n\n250\n\n\n300\n\nCountries (see legend)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| ![Germany](image) | Germany | 184,100\n | 50,050\n | 0\n | 234,150\n | 2.9\n | 2.3\n |\n| ![Greece](image) | Greece | 143,300\n | 221,350\n | 4,000\n | 368,650\n | 34.8\n | 13.5\n |\n| ![Hungary](image) | Hungary | 41,600\n | 20,000\n | 12,000\n | 73,600\n | 7.6\n | 4.3\n |\n| ![Iceland](image) | Iceland | 250\n | 250\n | 250\n | 750\n | 2.1\n | 0.7\n |\n| ![Italy](image) | Italy[p] | 175,100\n | 18,300\n | 182,350\n | 375,750\n | 6\n | 2.8\n |\n| ![Latvia](image) | Latvia | 16,700\n | 36,000\n | 0\n | 52,700\n | 28.3\n | 9\n |\n| ![Lithuania](image) | Lithuania | 23,000\n | 90,000\n | 14,150\n | 127,150\n | 46.9\n | 8.5\n |\n| ![Luxembourg](image) | Luxembourg | 940\n | 0\n | 600\n | 1,540\n | 2.4\n | 1.5\n |\n| ![Montenegro](image) | Montenegro | 2,350\n | 2,800\n | 10,100\n | 15,250\n | 25.1\n | 3.9\n |\n| ![Netherlands](image) | Netherlands | 41,543\n | 6,643\n | 6,500\n | 54,686\n | 3.2\n | 2.4\n |\n| ![North Macedonia](image) | North Macedonia | 8,000\n | 26,850\n | 7,600\n | 42,450\n | 19.9\n | 3.8\n |\n| ![Norway](image) | Norway | 25,400\n | 40,000\n | 0\n | 65,400\n | 11.9\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMembers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This article needs to be **updated**.
