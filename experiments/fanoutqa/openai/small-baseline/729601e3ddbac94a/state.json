They swept the Spurs in the first round of the Western Conference Finals before pulling out a tough seven-game series win over the Utah Jazz led by youngsters Karl Malone and John Stockton. A seven-game Western Conference finals win over the Dallas Mavericks propelled the Lakers to the NBA Finals once again. In their seventh trip to the Finals in nine years, they met the Detroit Pistons. Los Angeles would take the series in seven games, and James Worthy's game seven triple-double earned him a Finals MVP award.[127] The win marked their fifth title in nine years, but would also mark their last title until 2000.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFollowing the suspension of the 2019\u201320 NBA season, the Lakers were one of the 22 teams invited to the NBA Bubble to participate in the final eight games of the regular season.[276] The Lakers finished the regular season with a 52\u201319 record, entering the playoffs for the first time since 2013,[277] and as the top seed for the first time since 2010.[278] They advanced to the NBA Finals for the first time since 2010.[279] They defeated the Miami Heat 4\u20132 to win the 2020 NBA Finals,[280] and James was named the Finals MVP for the fourth time in his career.[281] The win gave Los Angeles their 17th championship in franchise history, tying the Boston Celtics for the most all-time.[282] Primary Lakers owner Jeanie Buss, who took over the team in 2017, would also become the first female controlling owner of an NBA team to win the NBA Finals.[283]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Seattle SuperSonics\u2013Oklahoma City Thunder (2008)\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nNational Basketball Association\n |\n| --- |\n| EasternConference | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Atlantic | Boston Celtics\nBrooklyn Nets\nNew York Knicks\nPhiladelphia 76ers\nToronto Raptors\n |\n| Central | Chicago Bulls\nCleveland Cavaliers\nDetroit Pistons\nIndiana Pacers\nMilwaukee Bucks\n |\n| Southeast | Atlanta Hawks\nCharlotte Hornets\nMiami Heat\nOrlando Magic\nWashington Wizards\n |\n\n |\n| WesternConference | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Northwest | Denver Nuggets\nMinnesota Timberwolves\nOklahoma City Thunder\nPortland Trail Blazers\nUtah Jazz\n |\n| Pacific | Golden State Warriors\nLos Angeles Clippers\nLos Angeles Lakers\nPhoenix Suns\nSacramento Kings\n |\n| Southwest | Dallas Mavericks\nHouston Rockets\nMemphis Grizzlies\nNew Orleans Pelicans\nSan Antonio Spurs\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Los Angeles Lakers |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) *2023\u201324 Los Angeles Lakers season* |\n| ![Los Angeles Lakers logo](image) |\n| Conference | Western |\n| Division | Pacific |\n| Founded | 1947 |\n| History | **Minneapolis Lakers**1947\u20131948 (NBL)1948\u20131960 (NBA)**Los Angeles Lakers**1960\u2013present[1][2][3] |\n| Arena | Crypto.com Arena |\n| Location | Los Angeles, California |\n| Team colors | Purple, gold, black[4][5][6]\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 |\n| Main sponsor | CJ CheilJedang[7] |\n| President | Jeanie Buss |\n| General manager | Rob Pelinka |\n| Head coach | Darvin Ham |\n| Ownership | Buss Family Trusts (majority)[8]Jeanie Buss (controlling owner)Philip Anschutz, Edward P.

They rallied back from a 3\u20132 disadvantage in the series and erased a 13-point deficit in the fourth quarter of the seventh game to defeat the Celtics. This series win gave them their 16th NBA title overall and 11th since they moved to Los Angeles.[222] Bryant was named Finals MVP for the second year in a row, despite a 6\u201324 shooting performance in game seven.[223]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

The Nuggets faced the top-seeded Los Angeles Lakers (57\u201325) in the first round. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFollowing the suspension of the 2019\u201320 NBA season, the Nuggets were one of the 22 teams invited to the NBA Bubble to participate in the final 8 games of the regular season.[77] Led by Joki\u0107 and Murray, the team is the first in NBA playoff history to consecutively come from 3\u20131 deficits. In the first round, they defeated Utah in 7 games in a record-breaking scoring duel between Jamal Murray and Donovan Mitchell.[78] The Nuggets repeated the same feat against Paul George and Kawhi Leonard of the Los Angeles Clippers in the second round, becoming the only team in NBA history to overcome multiple 3\u20131 deficits in a single playoff run. In the Western Conference Finals, the Nuggets' title race came to an end, after the eventual champion Los Angeles Lakers trounced them in five games.[79]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHowever, as had occurred in the 2005 playoffs, the Spurs bounced back to sweep the next four, as the Nuggets were eliminated in the first round in five games for the fourth straight year.\n\n\nOn March 16, 2008, the Nuggets scored 168 points in a 168\u2013116 home win over Seattle SuperSonics.[42] It was the third-most points scored for a regulation game in NBA history (The Nuggets and the Pistons hold the spot for most combined points scored in a game which was over 360 points total.)[42]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2005\u201306, for the first time in 18 years, the club won the Northwest division title.[37] This placed the team in the third seed of the Western Conference playoffs. Denver played the Los Angeles Clippers who, despite their sixth seeding, had a better regular season record. As a result, the Clippers received home-court advantage. They defeated the Nuggets in 5 games. Shortly after, the Nuggets announced that general manager Kiki Vandeweghe's contract would not be renewed. He was replaced by Mark Warkentien.[38]\n\n\nOn December 18, 2006, team co-captain Carmelo Anthony, shooting guard J. R. Smith and power forward Nen\u00ea were suspended by the NBA (15, 10 and one games respectively) for a fight that occurred in the last two minutes of a game against the New York Knicks two days earlier.[39][40] The fight was sparked by Knicks rookie Mardy Collins, when he tackled J. R. Smith on a breakaway layup. According to Anthony, Knicks coach Isiah Thomas warned him to not go in the paint shortly before the hard foul.[41]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Annual events | Draft\neligibility\nSummer League\nChristmas\nMartin Luther King Jr. Day\nAll-Star weekend\ngame\nGlobal Games\nCup tournament\nPlay-in\nPlayoffs\nlist\nfinals\nchampions\n |\n| History | Predecessors\nBAA\nNBL\nABA\nmerger\nWalter A.
