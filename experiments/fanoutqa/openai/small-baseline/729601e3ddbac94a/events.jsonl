On January 13, 2010, the Lakers became the first team in NBA history to win 3,000 regular-season games by defeating the Dallas Mavericks 100–95.[221] They defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder, the Utah Jazz, and the Phoenix Suns in the Western Conference playoffs. In the finals, the Lakers played the Boston Celtics for the 12th time. They rallied back from a 3–2 disadvantage in the series and erased a 13-point deficit in the fourth quarter of the seventh game to defeat the Celtics. This series win gave them their 16th NBA title overall and 11th since they moved to Los Angeles.[222] Bryant was named Finals MVP for the second year in a row, despite a 6–24 shooting performance in game seven.[223]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_8eD49UEf8RwTikj6bk21EuPH","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
