The city proper produces 15.8% of the country's gross domestic product.[162] In 2002, Mexico City had a Human Development Index score of 0.915,[163] identical to that of South Korea. In 2007, residents in the top twelve percent of GDP per capita holders in the city had a mean disposable income of US$98,517. The high spending power of Mexico City inhabitants makes the city attractive for companies offering prestige and luxury goods. According to a 2009 study conducted by PwC, Mexico City had a GDP of $390 billion, ranking it as the eighth richest city in the world and the richest in Latin America.[164] In 2009, Mexico City alone would rank as the 30th largest economy in the world.[165]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n106. **^** Lafregua, J; Gutierrez, A; Aguilar E; Aparicio J; Mejia R; Santillan O; Suarez MA; Preciado M (2003). \"Balance hídrico del Valle de Mexico\" (PDF).

The growth of the city has extended beyond the limits of the city to 59 municipalities of the State of Mexico and 1 in the state of Hidalgo.[112] With a population of approximately 19.8 million inhabitants (2008),[113] it is one of the most populous conurbations in the world. Nonetheless, the annual rate of growth of the Metropolitan Area of Mexico City is much lower than that of other large urban agglomerations in Mexico,[114] a phenomenon most likely attributable to the environmental policy of decentralization. The net migration rate of Mexico City from 1995 to 2000 was negative.[115]\n\n\n\n### Metropolitan area[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Greater Mexico City\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Greater Mexico City and Mexico City\nThe metropolitan area, Greater Mexico City ('Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México' or 'ZMVM' in Spanish) consists of Mexico City itself plus 60 municipalities in the State of Mexico and one in Hidalgo state.
