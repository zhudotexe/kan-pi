Of the 95 films that have won Best Picture, 68 have also been awarded Best Director. Only six films have been awarded Best Picture without receiving a Best Director nomination: *Wings* directed by William A. Wellman (1927/28), *Grand Hotel* directed by Edmund Goulding (1931/32), *Driving Miss Daisy* directed by Bruce Beresford (1989), *Argo* directed by Ben Affleck (2012), *Green Book* directed by Peter Farrelly (2018), and *CODA* directed by Sian Heder (2021). The only two Best Director winners to win for films that did not receive a Best Picture nomination were during the early years of the awards: Lewis Milestone for *Two Arabian Knights* (1927/28), and Frank Lloyd for *The Divine Lady* (1928/29).[14]\n\n\n\n### Nomination limit increased[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"How the Oscar Voting System Works\". *People.com*.

If there are only eight pictures that truly earn that honor in a given year, we shouldn't feel an obligation to round out the number.\"[21] This system lasted until 2021, when the Academy reverted back to a set number of ten nominees from the 94th Academy Awards onward.[22]\n\n\n\n### Language and country of origin[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| *Get Out* | Sean McKittrick, Jason Blum, Edward H.

Of the 95 films that have won Best Picture, 68 have also been awarded Best Director. Only six films have been awarded Best Picture without receiving a Best Director nomination: *Wings* directed by William A. Wellman (1927/28), *Grand Hotel* directed by Edmund Goulding (1931/32), *Driving Miss Daisy* directed by Bruce Beresford (1989), *Argo* directed by Ben Affleck (2012), *Green Book* directed by Peter Farrelly (2018), and *CODA* directed by Sian Heder (2021). The only two Best Director winners to win for films that did not receive a Best Picture nomination were during the early years of the awards: Lewis Milestone for *Two Arabian Knights* (1927/28), and Frank Lloyd for *The Divine Lady* (1928/29).[14]\n\n\n\n### Nomination limit increased[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"How the Oscar Voting System Works\". *People.com*.

This award goes to the producers of the film and is the only category in which every member of the Academy is eligible to submit a nomination and vote on the final ballot.[1] The Best Picture category is traditionally the final award of the night and is widely considered as the most prestigious honor of the ceremony.[2][3][4]\n\n\nThe Grand Staircase columns at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, where the Academy Awards ceremonies have been held since 2002, showcase every film that has won the Best Picture title since the award's inception.[5] There have been 591 films nominated for Best Picture and 95 winners.[6]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Category name changes[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n12. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** \"92ND ACADEMY AWARDS OF MERIT\" (PDF).

If there are only eight pictures that truly earn that honor in a given year, we shouldn't feel an obligation to round out the number.\"[21] This system lasted until 2021, when the Academy reverted back to a set number of ten nominees from the 94th Academy Awards onward.[22]\n\n\n\n### Language and country of origin[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| *Get Out* | Sean McKittrick, Jason Blum, Edward H.

However, after the nomination of Michael Curtiz for two films, *Angels with Dirty Faces* and *Four Daughters*, at the 11th Academy Awards, the rules were revised so that an individual could only be nominated for one film at each ceremony.[6] That rule has since been amended, although the only director who has received multiple nominations in the same year was Steven Soderbergh for *Erin Brockovich* and *Traffic* in 2000, winning the award for the latter. The Academy Awards for Best Director and Best Picture have been very closely linked throughout their history.

However, after the nomination of Michael Curtiz for two films, *Angels with Dirty Faces* and *Four Daughters*, at the 11th Academy Awards, the rules were revised so that an individual could only be nominated for one film at each ceremony.[6] That rule has since been amended, although the only director who has received multiple nominations in the same year was Steven Soderbergh for *Erin Brockovich* and *Traffic* in 2000, winning the award for the latter. The Academy Awards for Best Director and Best Picture have been very closely linked throughout their history. Of the 89 films that won Best Picture and were also nominated for Best Director, 68 won the award.[7][8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| David Fincher | *The Curious Case of Benjamin Button* |\n| Ron Howard | *Frost/Nixon* |\n| Gus Van Sant | *Milk* |\n| 2009(82nd) | **Kathryn Bigelow** | ***The Hurt Locker*** | [94] |\n| James Cameron | *Avatar* |\n| Lee Daniels | *Precious* |\n| Jason Reitman | *Up in the Air* |\n| Quentin Tarantino | *Inglourious Basterds* |\n\n\n### 2010s[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Year\n | Director(s)\n | Film\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2000(73rd) | **Steven Soderbergh** | ***Traffic*** | [85] |\n| Stephen Daldry | *Billy Elliot* |\n| Ang Lee | *Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon* |\n| Ridley Scott | *Gladiator* |\n| Steven Soderbergh | *Erin Brockovich* |\n| 2001(74th) | **Ron Howard** | ***A Beautiful Mind*** | [86] |\n| Robert Altman | *Gosford Park* |\n| Peter Jackson | *The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring* |\n| David Lynch | *Mulholland Drive* |\n| Ridley Scott | *Black Hawk Down* |\n| 2002(75th) | **Roman Polanski** | ***The Pianist*** | [87] |\n| Pedro AlmodÃ³var | *Talk to Her* |\n| Stephen Daldry | *The Hours* |\n| Rob Marshall | *Chicago* |\n| Martin Scorsese | *Gangs of New York* |\n| 2003(76th) | **Peter Jackson** | ***The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King*** | [88] |\n| Sofia Coppola | *Lost in Translation* |\n| Clint Eastwood | *Mystic River* |\n| Fernando Meirelles | *City of God* |\n| Peter Weir | *Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World* |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nCategory of film award\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Academy Award for Best Director |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)The 2022 recipients: Daniel Kwan & Daniel Scheinert\n |\n| Awarded for | Excellence in Cinematic Direction Achievement |\n| Country | United States |\n| Presented by | Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) |\n| First awarded | (1929)\nFrank Borzage,\n* *7th Heaven*(Dramatic Picture)\n\nLewis Milestone,\n* *Two Arabian Knights*(Comedy Picture)\n |\n| Most recent winner | (2023)\nDaniel Kwan & Daniel Scheinert,\n* *Everything Everywhere All at Once*\n |\n| Most awards | John Ford (4) |\n| Most nominations | William Wyler (12) |\n| Website | oscars.org |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Jonathan Demme won for *The Silence of the Lambs* (1991).\n![](image)Clint Eastwood won twice, for *Unforgiven* (1992) & *Million Dollar Baby* (2004)â€”latter, at 74, rendered him the oldest winner.\n![](image)Steven Spielberg won twice, for *Schindler's List* (1993) & *Saving Private Ryan* (1998).\n![](image)Robert Zemeckis won for *Forrest Gump* (1994).\n![](image)Mel Gibson won for *Braveheart* (1995).\n![](image)James Cameron won for *Titanic* (1997).\n![](image)Sam Mendes won for *American Beauty* (1999).\n![](image)Steven Soderbergh won for *Traffic* (2000).\n![](image)Ron Howard won for *A Beautiful Mind* (2001).\n![](image)Roman Polanski won for *The Pianist* (2002).\n![](image)Peter Jackson won for *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King* (2003).\n![](image)Ang Lee won twice, for *Brokeback Mountain* (2005) & *Life of Pi* (2012); first Asian winner.\n![](image)Martin Scorsese won for *The Departed* (2006).\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Robert Wise (1965)\n* Fred Zinnemann (1966)\n* Mike Nichols (1967)\n* Carol Reed (1968)\n* John Schlesinger (1969)\n* Franklin J.
