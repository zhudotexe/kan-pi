Beck's album *Morning Phase* was named Album of the Year. This prompted Kanye West, who later said he thought Beyoncé should have won, to jokingly leap onstage to interrupt Beck in a re-enactment of his 2009 MTV VMA scandal, but West left the stage without saying anything.[4] Both Pharrell Williams and Beyoncé took three honors; with her wins, Beyoncé became the second-most-honored female musician in Grammy history following Alison Krauss. Lifetime Achievement awards were given to the Bee Gees, George Harrison, Pierre Boulez, Buddy Guy, and Flaco Jiménez.[5]\n\n\nIn all, 83 Grammy Awards were presented, one more than in 2014.[6]\n\n\nThe show aired simultaneously on Fox8 in Australia,[7] Sky TV in New Zealand,[8] and on Channel O in South Africa.[9]\n\n\n\n\n## Pre-telecast ceremony[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* ***20 Feet from Stardom* – Darlene Love, Merry Clayton, Lisa Fischer and Judith Hill**\n\t+ **Morgan Neville, video director; Gil Friesen and Caitrin Rogers, video producers**\n* *On The Run Tour: Beyoncé and Jay-Z (TV Program)*\n\t+ Jonas Åkerlund, video director; Ed Burke, Svana Gisla and Dan Parise, video producers\n* *Ghost Stories* – Coldplay\n\t+ Paul Dugdale, video director; Jim Parsons, video producer\n* \"Metallica Through the Never\" – Metallica\n\t+ Nimród Antal, video director; Adam Ellison and Charlotte Huggins, video producers\n* *The Truth About Love Tour: Live from Melbourne* – Pink\n\t+ Larn Poland, video director; Roger Davies, video producer\n\n\n## Special Merit Awards[edit]\n\n\n### MusiCares Person of the Year[edit]\n\n\nMain article: MusiCares Person of the Year\n\n* Bob Dylan\n\n\n### Lifetime Achievement Award[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award\n\n* Bee Gees\n* Pierre Boulez\n* Buddy Guy\n* George Harrison\n* Maria Cordero\n* Flaco Jiménez\n* The Louvin Brothers\n* Wayne Shorter\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nGrammy Awards\n |\n| --- |\n| * The Recording Academy\n* Categories\n* Grammy Nominees\n* Records\n* Locations\n* EGOT\n |\n| Special awards | * Legend Award\n* Lifetime Achievement Award\n* Trustees Award\n* Special Merit/Technical Grammy Award\n* Hall of Fame\n* MusiCares Person of the Year\n |\n| Ceremonies | * 1958\n* 1959\n* 1960\n* 1961\n* 1962\n* 1963\n* 1964\n* 1965\n* 1966\n* 1967\n* 1968\n* 1969\n* 1970\n* 1971\n* 1972\n* 1973\n* 1974\n* 1975\n* 1976\n* 1977\n* 1978\n* 1979\n* 1980\n* 1981\n* 1982\n* 1983\n* 1984\n* 1985\n* 1986\n* 1987\n* 1988\n* 1989\n* 1990\n* 1991\n* 1992\n* 1993\n* 1994\n* 1995\n* 1996\n* 1997\n* 1998\n* 1999\n* 2000\n* 2001\n* 2002\n* 2003\n* 2004\n* 2005\n* 2006\n* 2007\n* 2008\n* 2009\n* 2010\n* 2011\n* 2012\n* 2013\n* 2014\n* 2015\n* 2016\n* 2017\n* 2018\n* 2019\n* 2020\n* 2021\n* 2022\n* 2023\n* 2024\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* *G I R L* – Pharrell Williams\n\t+ Alicia Keys and Justin Timberlake, featured artists; Pharrell Williams, producer; Leslie Brathwaite, Adrian Breakspear, Andrew Coleman, Jimmy Douglas, Hart Gunther, Mick Guzauski, Florian Lagatta, Mike Larson, Stephanie McNally, Alan Meyerson, Ann Mincieli and Kenta Yonesaka, engineers/mixers; Bob Ludwig, mastering engineer\n\n\n**Song of the Year**\n\n\n\n* **\"Stay with Me\" (Darkchild Version)**1\n\t+ **James Napier, William Phillips and Sam Smith, songwriters (Sam Smith)**\n* \"All About That Bass\"\n\t+ Kevin Kadish and Meghan Trainor, songwriters (Meghan Trainor)\n* \"Chandelier\"\n\t+ Sia Furler and Jesse Shatkin, songwriters (Sia)\n* \"Shake It Off\"\n\t+ Max Martin, Shellback and Taylor Swift, songwriters (Taylor Swift)\n* \"Take Me to Church\"\n\t+ Andrew Hozier-Byrne, songwriter (Hozier)\n\n\n**Best New Artist**\n\n\n\n* **Sam Smith**\n* Iggy Azalea\n* Bastille\n* Brandy Clark\n* HAIM\n\n\n### Pop[edit]\n\n\n**Best Pop Solo Performance**\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n | * Fred Hersch\n* John Hiatt\n* J-Roc\n* Keb' Mo'\n* Kevin Kadish\n* Wiz Khalifa\n* Richard King\n* Greg Kurstin\n* Luke Laird\n* Kendrick Lamar\n* Mike Larson\n* Howard Lawrence\n* John Legend\n* Morten Lindberg\n* Kristen Anderson-Lopez\n* Robert Lopez\n* Joe Lovano\n* Mali Music\n\n\n | * Elaine Martone\n* Pete McGuinness\n* MercyMe\n* Edgar Meyer\n* Ann Mincieli\n* Nicki Minaj\n* Ludovic Morlot\n* Jimmy Napes\n* Robbie Nelson\n* Nickel Creek\n* Smokie Norful\n* Partch\n* Katy Perry\n* Tom Petty\n* Steve Price\n* Julian Raymond\n* Rufus Reid\n* Robert Glasper Experiment\n\n\n | * Schoolboy Q\n* Jesse Shatkin\n* Noah \"40\" Shebib\n* Shellback\n* Chris Thile\n* Darrell Thorp\n* Timbaland\n* Justin Timberlake\n* Meghan Trainor\n* Daniil Trifonov\n* Cassidy Turbin\n* Carrie Underwood\n* Keith Urban\n* Joe Visciano\n* Kanye West\n* Charlie Wilson\n* Jesse Winchester\n\n\n |\n\nThe following received multiple awards:\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| *Four:*\n* Sam Smith\n\n*Three:*\n* Beyoncé\n* Rosanne Cash\n* Bob Ludwig\n* Pharrell Williams\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNot all Grammys were presented during the live telecast.

Beck's album *Morning Phase* was named Album of the Year. This prompted Kanye West, who later said he thought Beyoncé should have won, to jokingly leap onstage to interrupt Beck in a re-enactment of his 2009 MTV VMA scandal, but West left the stage without saying anything.[4] Both Pharrell Williams and Beyoncé took three honors; with her wins, Beyoncé became the second-most-honored female musician in Grammy history following Alison Krauss. Lifetime Achievement awards were given to the Bee Gees, George Harrison, Pierre Boulez, Buddy Guy, and Flaco Jiménez.[5]\n\n\nIn all, 83 Grammy Awards were presented, one more than in 2014.[6]\n\n\nThe show aired simultaneously on Fox8 in Australia,[7] Sky TV in New Zealand,[8] and on Channel O in South Africa.[9]\n\n\n\n\n## Pre-telecast ceremony[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* ***20 Feet from Stardom* – Darlene Love, Merry Clayton, Lisa Fischer and Judith Hill**\n\t+ **Morgan Neville, video director; Gil Friesen and Caitrin Rogers, video producers**\n* *On The Run Tour: Beyoncé and Jay-Z (TV Program)*\n\t+ Jonas Åkerlund, video director; Ed Burke, Svana Gisla and Dan Parise, video producers\n* *Ghost Stories* – Coldplay\n\t+ Paul Dugdale, video director; Jim Parsons, video producer\n* \"Metallica Through the Never\" – Metallica\n\t+ Nimród Antal, video director; Adam Ellison and Charlotte Huggins, video producers\n* *The Truth About Love Tour: Live from Melbourne* – Pink\n\t+ Larn Poland, video director; Roger Davies, video producer\n\n\n## Special Merit Awards[edit]\n\n\n### MusiCares Person of the Year[edit]\n\n\nMain article: MusiCares Person of the Year\n\n* Bob Dylan\n\n\n### Lifetime Achievement Award[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award\n\n* Bee Gees\n* Pierre Boulez\n* Buddy Guy\n* George Harrison\n* Maria Cordero\n* Flaco Jiménez\n* The Louvin Brothers\n* Wayne Shorter\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nGrammy Awards\n |\n| --- |\n| * The Recording Academy\n* Categories\n* Grammy Nominees\n* Records\n* Locations\n* EGOT\n |\n| Special awards | * Legend Award\n* Lifetime Achievement Award\n* Trustees Award\n* Special Merit/Technical Grammy Award\n* Hall of Fame\n* MusiCares Person of the Year\n |\n| Ceremonies | * 1958\n* 1959\n* 1960\n* 1961\n* 1962\n* 1963\n* 1964\n* 1965\n* 1966\n* 1967\n* 1968\n* 1969\n* 1970\n* 1971\n* 1972\n* 1973\n* 1974\n* 1975\n* 1976\n* 1977\n* 1978\n* 1979\n* 1980\n* 1981\n* 1982\n* 1983\n* 1984\n* 1985\n* 1986\n* 1987\n* 1988\n* 1989\n* 1990\n* 1991\n* 1992\n* 1993\n* 1994\n* 1995\n* 1996\n* 1997\n* 1998\n* 1999\n* 2000\n* 2001\n* 2002\n* 2003\n* 2004\n* 2005\n* 2006\n* 2007\n* 2008\n* 2009\n* 2010\n* 2011\n* 2012\n* 2013\n* 2014\n* 2015\n* 2016\n* 2017\n* 2018\n* 2019\n* 2020\n* 2021\n* 2022\n* 2023\n* 2024\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* *G I R L* – Pharrell Williams\n\t+ Alicia Keys and Justin Timberlake, featured artists; Pharrell Williams, producer; Leslie Brathwaite, Adrian Breakspear, Andrew Coleman, Jimmy Douglas, Hart Gunther, Mick Guzauski, Florian Lagatta, Mike Larson, Stephanie McNally, Alan Meyerson, Ann Mincieli and Kenta Yonesaka, engineers/mixers; Bob Ludwig, mastering engineer\n\n\n**Song of the Year**\n\n\n\n* **\"Stay with Me\" (Darkchild Version)**1\n\t+ **James Napier, William Phillips and Sam Smith, songwriters (Sam Smith)**\n* \"All About That Bass\"\n\t+ Kevin Kadish and Meghan Trainor, songwriters (Meghan Trainor)\n* \"Chandelier\"\n\t+ Sia Furler and Jesse Shatkin, songwriters (Sia)\n* \"Shake It Off\"\n\t+ Max Martin, Shellback and Taylor Swift, songwriters (Taylor Swift)\n* \"Take Me to Church\"\n\t+ Andrew Hozier-Byrne, songwriter (Hozier)\n\n\n**Best New Artist**\n\n\n\n* **Sam Smith**\n* Iggy Azalea\n* Bastille\n* Brandy Clark\n* HAIM\n\n\n### Pop[edit]\n\n\n**Best Pop Solo Performance**\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n | * Fred Hersch\n* John Hiatt\n* J-Roc\n* Keb' Mo'\n* Kevin Kadish\n* Wiz Khalifa\n* Richard King\n* Greg Kurstin\n* Luke Laird\n* Kendrick Lamar\n* Mike Larson\n* Howard Lawrence\n* John Legend\n* Morten Lindberg\n* Kristen Anderson-Lopez\n* Robert Lopez\n* Joe Lovano\n* Mali Music\n\n\n | * Elaine Martone\n* Pete McGuinness\n* MercyMe\n* Edgar Meyer\n* Ann Mincieli\n* Nicki Minaj\n* Ludovic Morlot\n* Jimmy Napes\n* Robbie Nelson\n* Nickel Creek\n* Smokie Norful\n* Partch\n* Katy Perry\n* Tom Petty\n* Steve Price\n* Julian Raymond\n* Rufus Reid\n* Robert Glasper Experiment\n\n\n | * Schoolboy Q\n* Jesse Shatkin\n* Noah \"40\" Shebib\n* Shellback\n* Chris Thile\n* Darrell Thorp\n* Timbaland\n* Justin Timberlake\n* Meghan Trainor\n* Daniil Trifonov\n* Cassidy Turbin\n* Carrie Underwood\n* Keith Urban\n* Joe Visciano\n* Kanye West\n* Charlie Wilson\n* Jesse Winchester\n\n\n |\n\nThe following received multiple awards:\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| *Four:*\n* Sam Smith\n\n*Three:*\n* Beyoncé\n* Rosanne Cash\n* Bob Ludwig\n* Pharrell Williams\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNot all Grammys were presented during the live telecast.
