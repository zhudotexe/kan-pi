However, this criterion is not easy to employ in the case of most of the world's largest rivers. Depending on which definition or interpretation is preferred, there can certainly be a couple of different answers for the source of a given river.\nThus, a number of headstream areas of the Amazon River should be considered: \n\n\n\n1. the Marañon River (the Lauricocha and Nupe Rivers) in a historical context;\n2. the Mantaro River with the most distant but semi-permanent spring;\n3. the Apurímac River (the Carhuasanta River) with the most distant source of uninterrupted flow.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2014, James Contos and Nicholas Tripcevich came up with a finding that the most distant source of the Amazon is called the Mantaro River. They located the most distant spring in the headwaters of Lake Junin in the Rumi Cruz mountains 10°43′55″S 76°38′53″W﻿ / ﻿10.732°S 76.648°W﻿ / -10.732; -76.648, at an elevation of 5,220 metres (17,130 ft). Contos and Tripcevich calculated and compared the length of the Apurímac 734.3 kilometres (456.3 mi) and Mantaro Rivers 809 kilometres (503 mi) and found that the Mantaro River is about 75 kilometres (47 mi) longer. Nevertheless, Contos and Tripcevich acknowledge that the flow of the Mantaro River source is interrupted several months a year and thus a drop of water at its source may not complete the journey to the mouth of the Amazon.[26]\n\n\n\n## Headstream areas of the Amazon River[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Marañón, Mantaro and Apurímac Rivers originate in the high mountain area of the Peruvian Andes at altitudes over 5,000 metres (16,000 ft). All three sources are considered to be the source of the Amazon, but from different points of view. The Marañón can be considered as the main source of the Amazon based on its discharge, but the Ucayali and its tributaries are longer—2,738 kilometres (1,701 mi) compared to 1,415 kilometres (879 mi) of the Marañón.[6][7] The main source of the Amazon River is therefore difficult to determine, so it is correct to talk about several of its source areas.\n\n\n\n## The Marañón River headwaters[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHeadwaters of the Amazon River\n\n![](image)Map of the Amazon River\nThe main source of the largest river in the world[nb 1] has been a subject of exploring and speculations for centuries and continues to cause arguments even today. Determining the origin of the Amazon River has evoked broad debates among scholars, explorers, and travelers all over the world. Different definitions of a river's source have been used and continue to be used. Generally, four main criteria can be applied to determine the main source of a river: source flow rate, source length, watershed area of the source, and an altitude of its spring.[2] At present, the Amazon River is not considered to have one unique source but a number of headstream areas. These are headwaters of three different Peruvian rivers that can be found in the high Andes: the Marañón, the Apurímac, and the Mantaro.\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Bohumír Janský (Czech-Peruvian expedition Hatun Mayu 2000) | 2000 | Nevado Mismi - headwaters territory with sources of Carhuasanta, Ccaccansa, Apacheta and Sillanque\n |\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The Amazon is the largest river in the world by discharge.[1]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFritz's claim about the main source of the Amazon River was unchallenged for nearly 200 years.
