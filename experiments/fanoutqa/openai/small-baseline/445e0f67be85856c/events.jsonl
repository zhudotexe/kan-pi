Besides the *Star Wars* and *Superman* franchises, *James Bond* and *Godzilla* films are still being released periodically; all four are among the highest-grossing franchises. Some of the older films that held the record of highest-grossing film still have respectable grosses by today's standards, but no longer compete numerically against today's top-earners in an era of much higher individual ticket prices. When those prices are adjusted for inflation, however, then *Gone with the Wind*—which was the highest-grossing film outright for twenty-five years—is still the highest-grossing film of all time. All grosses on the list are expressed in U.S. dollars at their nominal value, except where stated otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n## Highest-grossing films[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHighest-grossing films as of 2022[update] adjusted for inflation[35][Inf]\n| Rank\n | Title\n | Worldwide gross(2022 $)\n | Year\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | *Gone with the Wind* | $4,192,000,000\n | 1939\n |\n| 2\n | *Avatar* | A1$3,824,000,000\n | 2009\n |\n| 3\n | *Titanic* | $2,516,000,000T$3,485,000,000\n | 1997\n |\n| 4\n | *Star Wars* | $3,443,000,000\n | 1977\n |\n| 5\n | *Avengers: Endgame* | AE$3,165,000,000\n | 2019\n |\n| 6\n | *The Sound of Music* | $2,884,000,000\n | 1965\n |\n| 7\n | *E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial* | $2,815,000,000\n | 1982\n |\n| 8\n | *The Ten Commandments* | $2,665,000,000\n | 1956\n |\n| 9\n | *Doctor Zhivago* | $2,526,000,000\n | 1965\n |\n| 10\n | *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* | TFA$2,491,000,000\n | 2015\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDespite the inherent difficulties in accounting for inflation, several attempts have been made.

The figures in the above chart take into account inflation that occurred in 2014, and in every available year since then, through 2022.\n\n\nA1The adjusted gross for *Avatar* includes revenue from the original release and all four reissues. The original release and 2010 Special Edition grosses are adjusted from the Guinness base year, whilst the 2020 and 2021 grosses are adjusted from the 2021 index and the 2022 gross from 2022.[37]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n*Gone with the Wind* is likewise represented twice on the chart: the 1940 entry includes earnings from its staggered 1939–1942 release (roadshow/​general release/​second-run)[86] along with all of its revenue up to the 1961 reissue prior to losing the record to *The Sound of Music* in 1966; its 1971 entry—after it took back the record—includes income from the 1967 and 1971 reissues but omitting later releases. *The Godfather* was re-released in 1973 after its success at the 45th Academy Awards, and *Jaws* was released again in 1976, and their grosses here most likely include earnings from those releases. *The Sound of Music*, *The Godfather*, *Jaws*, *Jurassic Park*, and *Titanic* increased their earnings with further releases in 1973, 1997, 1979, 2013, and 2012, respectively, but they are not included in the totals here because they had already conceded the record prior to being re-released.\n\n\n\n\n\nTimeline of the highest-grossing film record\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSteven Spielberg is the most represented director on the chart, with six films to his credit, occupying the top spot in 1975, 1981, 1982, 1984, 1989 and 1993. Cecil B. DeMille (1932, 1947, 1949, 1952 and 1956) is in second place with five films and William Wyler (1942, 1946, 1959 and 1968) and James Cameron (1991, 1997, 2009 and 2022) are tied for third place with four films. D. W. Griffith (1915, 1916 and 1920), George Roy Hill (1966, 1969 and 1973) and the Russo brothers (2016, 2018 and 2019) all feature heavily with three films apiece. George Lucas directed two chart-toppers in 1977 and 1999, but also served in a strong creative capacity as a producer and writer in 1980, 1981, 1983, 1984 and 1989 as well. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBecause of the long-term effects of inflation, notably the significant increase of movie theater ticket prices, the list unadjusted for inflation gives far more weight to later films.[22] The unadjusted list, while commonly found in the press, is therefore largely meaningless for comparing films widely separated in time, as many films from earlier eras will never appear on a modern unadjusted list, despite achieving higher commercial success when adjusted for price increases.[23] To compensate for the devaluation of the currency, some charts make adjustments for inflation, but not even this practice fully addresses the issue, since ticket prices and inflation do not necessarily parallel one another. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAt least eleven films have held the record of 'highest-grossing film' since *The Birth of a Nation* assumed the top spot in 1915. Both *The Birth of a Nation* and *Gone with the Wind* spent twenty-five consecutive years apiece as the highest-grosser, with films directed by Steven Spielberg and James Cameron holding the record on three occasions each. Spielberg became the first director to break his own record when *Jurassic Park* overtook *E.T.*, and Cameron emulated the feat when *Avatar* broke the record set by *Titanic*. When it took over the top spot in 2019, *Avengers: Endgame* became the first sequel to hold the record of highest-grossing film, and in doing so interrupted thirty-six years of Spielberg/Cameron dominance before *Avatar* reclaimed the top spot two years later in 2021 upon a re-release.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn this chart, films are ranked by the revenues from theatrical exhibition at their nominal value, along with the highest positions they attained. Six films in total have grossed in excess of $2 billion worldwide, with *Avatar* ranked in the top position. All of the films have had a theatrical run (including re-releases) in the 21st century, and films that have not played during this period do not appear on the chart because of ticket-price inflation, population size and ticket purchasing trends not being considered.\n\n\n\n\n† *Background shading indicates films playing in the week commencing 13 June 2024 in theaters around the world*.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | [# 3] |\n| 2021[97] | *Avatar* | $2,847,397,339 ‡ | [# 1] |\n| *2022* | $2,923,706,026 ‡ |\n\n\nRDistributor rental.\n\n\n‡Includes revenue from re-releases.

Besides the *Star Wars* and *Superman* franchises, *James Bond* and *Godzilla* films are still being released periodically; all four are among the highest-grossing franchises. Some of the older films that held the record of highest-grossing film still have respectable grosses by today's standards, but no longer compete numerically against today's top-earners in an era of much higher individual ticket prices. When those prices are adjusted for inflation, however, then *Gone with the Wind*—which was the highest-grossing film outright for twenty-five years—is still the highest-grossing film of all time. All grosses on the list are expressed in U.S. dollars at their nominal value, except where stated otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n## Highest-grossing films[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHighest-grossing films as of 2022[update] adjusted for inflation[35][Inf]\n| Rank\n | Title\n | Worldwide gross(2022 $)\n | Year\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | *Gone with the Wind* | $4,192,000,000\n | 1939\n |\n| 2\n | *Avatar* | A1$3,824,000,000\n | 2009\n |\n| 3\n | *Titanic* | $2,516,000,000T$3,485,000,000\n | 1997\n |\n| 4\n | *Star Wars* | $3,443,000,000\n | 1977\n |\n| 5\n | *Avengers: Endgame* | AE$3,165,000,000\n | 2019\n |\n| 6\n | *The Sound of Music* | $2,884,000,000\n | 1965\n |\n| 7\n | *E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial* | $2,815,000,000\n | 1982\n |\n| 8\n | *The Ten Commandments* | $2,665,000,000\n | 1956\n |\n| 9\n | *Doctor Zhivago* | $2,526,000,000\n | 1965\n |\n| 10\n | *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* | TFA$2,491,000,000\n | 2015\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDespite the inherent difficulties in accounting for inflation, several attempts have been made.

The figures in the above chart take into account inflation that occurred in 2014, and in every available year since then, through 2022.\n\n\nA1The adjusted gross for *Avatar* includes revenue from the original release and all four reissues. The original release and 2010 Special Edition grosses are adjusted from the Guinness base year, whilst the 2020 and 2021 grosses are adjusted from the 2021 index and the 2022 gross from 2022.[37]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n*Gone with the Wind* is likewise represented twice on the chart: the 1940 entry includes earnings from its staggered 1939–1942 release (roadshow/​general release/​second-run)[86] along with all of its revenue up to the 1961 reissue prior to losing the record to *The Sound of Music* in 1966; its 1971 entry—after it took back the record—includes income from the 1967 and 1971 reissues but omitting later releases. *The Godfather* was re-released in 1973 after its success at the 45th Academy Awards, and *Jaws* was released again in 1976, and their grosses here most likely include earnings from those releases. *The Sound of Music*, *The Godfather*, *Jaws*, *Jurassic Park*, and *Titanic* increased their earnings with further releases in 1973, 1997, 1979, 2013, and 2012, respectively, but they are not included in the totals here because they had already conceded the record prior to being re-released.\n\n\n\n\n\nTimeline of the highest-grossing film record\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSteven Spielberg is the most represented director on the chart, with six films to his credit, occupying the top spot in 1975, 1981, 1982, 1984, 1989 and 1993. Cecil B. DeMille (1932, 1947, 1949, 1952 and 1956) is in second place with five films and William Wyler (1942, 1946, 1959 and 1968) and James Cameron (1991, 1997, 2009 and 2022) are tied for third place with four films. D. W. Griffith (1915, 1916 and 1920), George Roy Hill (1966, 1969 and 1973) and the Russo brothers (2016, 2018 and 2019) all feature heavily with three films apiece. George Lucas directed two chart-toppers in 1977 and 1999, but also served in a strong creative capacity as a producer and writer in 1980, 1981, 1983, 1984 and 1989 as well. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBecause of the long-term effects of inflation, notably the significant increase of movie theater ticket prices, the list unadjusted for inflation gives far more weight to later films.[22] The unadjusted list, while commonly found in the press, is therefore largely meaningless for comparing films widely separated in time, as many films from earlier eras will never appear on a modern unadjusted list, despite achieving higher commercial success when adjusted for price increases.[23] To compensate for the devaluation of the currency, some charts make adjustments for inflation, but not even this practice fully addresses the issue, since ticket prices and inflation do not necessarily parallel one another. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAt least eleven films have held the record of 'highest-grossing film' since *The Birth of a Nation* assumed the top spot in 1915. Both *The Birth of a Nation* and *Gone with the Wind* spent twenty-five consecutive years apiece as the highest-grosser, with films directed by Steven Spielberg and James Cameron holding the record on three occasions each. Spielberg became the first director to break his own record when *Jurassic Park* overtook *E.T.*, and Cameron emulated the feat when *Avatar* broke the record set by *Titanic*. When it took over the top spot in 2019, *Avengers: Endgame* became the first sequel to hold the record of highest-grossing film, and in doing so interrupted thirty-six years of Spielberg/Cameron dominance before *Avatar* reclaimed the top spot two years later in 2021 upon a re-release.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn this chart, films are ranked by the revenues from theatrical exhibition at their nominal value, along with the highest positions they attained. Six films in total have grossed in excess of $2 billion worldwide, with *Avatar* ranked in the top position. All of the films have had a theatrical run (including re-releases) in the 21st century, and films that have not played during this period do not appear on the chart because of ticket-price inflation, population size and ticket purchasing trends not being considered.\n\n\n\n\n† *Background shading indicates films playing in the week commencing 13 June 2024 in theaters around the world*.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | [# 3] |\n| 2021[97] | *Avatar* | $2,847,397,339 ‡ | [# 1] |\n| *2022* | $2,923,706,026 ‡ |\n\n\nRDistributor rental.\n\n\n‡Includes revenue from re-releases.
