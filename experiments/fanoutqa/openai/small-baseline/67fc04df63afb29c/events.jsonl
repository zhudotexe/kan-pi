Though they remain one of baseball's most dominant teams, the Dodgers have not returned to the World Series since then, losing the 2021 NLCS to the Braves, the 2022 NLDS to the Padres, and the 2023 NLDS in a sweep to the Arizona Diamondbacks. Every Dodger team since 2021 has won over 100 games, but they won two combined playoff series from 2021-2023, with the 111-win 2022 setting a dubious achievement for most regular season wins to not win even one postseason series. \n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_XesELgTKYhujrtiCd1hl4t1P","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
