To Armstrong it came as no surprise—the room was full of veterans of Project Gemini, the only people who could fly the lunar missions.

At the time of their meeting, the four men did not know about the hatch consideration. The first knowledge of the meeting outside the small group came when Kraft wrote his book.[113][114] Methods of circumventing this difficulty existed, but it is not known if these were considered at the time.

It finally lifted off on August 21.[73] Armstrong and See watched the launch at Cape Kennedy, then flew to the Manned Spacecraft Center (MSC) in Houston.[74] The mission was generally successful, despite a problem with the fuel cells that prevented a rendezvous. Cooper and Conrad practiced a \"phantom rendezvous\", carrying out the maneuver without a target.[75]\n\n\n\n\n#### Gemini 8[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Gemini 8\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_XqLy64oRzFnBu9PR8nqmy91d","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

Multiple factors contributed to the final decision, including the physical positioning of the astronauts within the compact lunar lander, which made it easier for Armstrong to be the first to exit the spacecraft. Furthermore, there was little support for Aldrin's views among senior astronauts who would command later Apollo missions.[63] Collins has commented that he thought Aldrin \"resents not being first on the Moon more than he appreciates being second\".[64]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter earning a Doctor of Science degree in astronautics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Aldrin was selected as a member of NASA's Astronaut Group 3, making him the first astronaut with a doctoral degree.

His first space flight was in 1966 on Gemini 12, during which he spent over five hours on extravehicular activity. Three years later, Aldrin set foot on the Moon at 03:15:16 on July 21, 1969 (UTC), nineteen minutes after Armstrong first touched the surface, while command module pilot Michael Collins remained in lunar orbit.
