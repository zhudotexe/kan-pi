Previously known as Batavia, it was the *de facto* capital of the Dutch East Indies. In the early 20th century, the Dutch East Indies government attempted to relocate the capital from Batavia to Bandung.[2] During Indonesia's struggle for independence, the Indonesian government moved the capital to Yogyakarta and then to Bukittinggi, where it remained for a short time until the restoration of control to Jakarta.[3] In 2019, during his annual state of the union address at the parliament, President Joko Widodo announced a plan to relocate the capital to Kalimantan on the island of Borneo.[4] As part of the plan, part of Kutai Kartanegara Regency and Penajam North Paser Regency in East Kalimantan will be carved out to create a new province-level planned city, and the capital will be relocated to a more central location within Indonesia. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNational capital in Indonesia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring the highly centralised New Order regime of Sukarno's successor Suharto, Jakarta was further established as the political and economic core of the nation. Prompted by rapid development and urbanisation, Jakarta attracted large numbers of new settlers from all over the archipelago, with the majority coming from rural Javanese towns. High-rise buildings sprung up, especially in Jakarta's commercial and financial centres along Thamrin, Sudirman, and Kuningan avenues. As a result, since the 1970s, the population of Jakarta has spiked tremendously and spilled into areas surrounding the capital. The Jabodetabek, or Greater Jakarta, region has become the largest and the most densely populated urban agglomeration in Southeast Asia.\n\n\n\n## New capital proposals throughout the decades[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nProposals to move the Indonesian capital from Jakarta to other locations have been discussed since the Sukarno presidency. Massive overpopulation, a lack of urban infrastructures such as public transportation facilities, gridlock traffic, encroachment of urban areas replacing open green spaces, spread of slums within the city, over-extraction of groundwater, and poor water drainage systems have led to Jakarta's ecological degradation. As groundwater was depleted, the city slowly sank lower; parts of Northern Jakarta are below sea level and regularly encounter floods. Jakarta experienced massive floods in 2007 and 2013. In 2010, the debate about the creation of a new capital that would be separated from the urban, economic, and commercial centre of the country continued. Former president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono supported the idea to create a new political and administrative centre of Indonesia due to Jakarta's environmental and overpopulation problems.[18][19]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn April 2017, the Joko Widodo (Jokowi) administration considered moving the capital from Jakarta. The government planned to finish assessing potential alternative sites for Indonesia's new capital by the end of 2017. According to an official from the Ministry of National Development Planning of Indonesia (Bappenas), the government was determined to move the Indonesian capital out of Java.[32] In April 2019, it was announced that Jakarta would no longer be the capital of Indonesia in the future, with a 10-year plan to transfer all government offices to a new capital city.[33] The National Development Planning Ministry recommended the three provinces of South, Central, and East Kalimantan as they all met the requirements for a new capital, including being relatively free from earthquakes and volcanoes. Shortly after the plan was announced in April 2017, Jokowi visited two alternative locations in Kalimantan, Bukit Soeharto in East Kalimantan and the Triangle Area near Palangka Raya in Central Kalimantan.[34]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * Administrative divisions\n\t+ Historical\n\t+ Provinces\n\t+ Regencies & Cities\n\t+ Districts\n* Cabinet\n* Constitution\n* Elections\n* Foreign relations\n* Human rights\n* Refugees\n* Law\n\t+ Censorship\n\t+ Enforcement\n* Military (Babinsa)\n* National capital\n* *Pancasila*\n* People's Consultative Assembly\n* Police\n* Political parties\n* President (List)\n* *Wawasan Nusantara*\n |\n\n |\n| Economy | \n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * Agriculture\n* Automotive\n* Aviation\n* Banks\n* Energy\n* History\n* Science and technology\n* Stock Exchange\n* Telecommunications\n* Tourism\n* Transport\n* Water supply and sanitation\n |\n\n |\n| Society | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Jonggol, West Java, located about 40 kilometres southeast of Jakarta, and proposed future capital of Indonesia since the New Order.[26]\n* Karawang, West Java, located about 60 kilometres east of Jakarta.[27]\n* Kertajati, Majalengka Regency, West Java, located about 200 kilometres east of Jakarta and 40 kilometres west of Cirebon. The proposed planned capital will be connected to the planned new West Java airport, Java railways, and the Trans-Java toll road.[28] The underused airport has been derided as a 'white elephant' during the 2019 presidential elections and policymakers are under pressure to demonstrate utility for the enormous bills related to the project.[29]\n* Maja, Lebak Regency, Banten, located about 60 kilometres west of Jakarta.
