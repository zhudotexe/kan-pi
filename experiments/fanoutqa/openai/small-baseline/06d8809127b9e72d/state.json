The current tallest tree is the Hyperion tree, measuring 115.61\u00a0m (379.3\u00a0ft).[37] The tree was discovered in Redwood National Park during mid-2006 by Chris Atkins and Michael Taylor, and is thought to be the world's tallest living organism. The previous record holder was the Stratosphere Giant in Humboldt Redwoods State Park at 112.84\u00a0m (370.2\u00a0ft) (as measured in 2004). Until it fell in March 1991, the \"Dyerville Giant\" was the record holder. It, too, stood in Humboldt Redwoods State Park and was 113.4\u00a0m (372\u00a0ft) high and estimated to be 1,600\u00a0years old. This fallen giant has been preserved in the park.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n80. ^ ***a*** ***b*** National Park Service (1997). \"The General Sherman Tree\". *Sequoia National Park*.

This record is often disputed as unreliable, despite first-hand documentary evidence of it being measured on the ground with surveyor's tape by a senior forestry official (see below). Widespread agreement exists, however, that an exceptionally tall individual was reliably measured at 112.8 metres (370\u00a0ft) by theodolite in 1880 by a surveyor, George Cornthwaite, at Thorpdale, Victoria (the tree is known both as the Cornthwaite or Thorpdale Tree). When it was felled in 1881, Cornthwaite remeasured it on the ground by chain at 114.3 metres (375\u00a0ft).[48] The stump is commemorated with a plaque. That tree was about 1 metre (3.3\u00a0ft) shorter than *Hyperion*, the world's current tallest living tree, a coast redwood measuring 115.5 metres (379.1\u00a0ft).[49]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n27. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Wood, S.W.; Hua, Q.; Allen, K.J.; Bowman, D.M.J.S.

A severe storm in 1959 blew down 13 of the trees and the tallest tree was reduced to a height of 84 metres (276\u00a0ft) after it lost part of its crown. The height of this tree was cited as 81.5 metres (267\u00a0ft) in 2002 following further storm damage in 1973.[23] In 2000, a tree at Wallaby Catchment in Kinglake National Park was discovered to be 91.6 metres (301\u00a0ft) tall in 2000,[23] however it perished in the Black Saturday bushfires of 2009.[47]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA study carried out by environmental scientist Professor Brendan Mackey of the Australian National University in 2009 identified that mountain ash forests in Victoria\u2019s Central Highlands are the best in the world at locking up carbon.[40] Mackey and colleagues found the highest amount of carbon was contained in a forest located in the O'Shannassy River catchment, which held 1,867 tonnes per hectare (743.62\u00a0long ton/acre; 832.85\u00a0short ton/acre) of carbon. This area was a stand of unlogged mountain ash over 100 years old, which had had minimal human disturbance. They further calculated that a *E. regnans*-dominated forest with trees up to 250 years old and a well-established mid-storey and upper storey could store up to 2,844 tonnes per hectare (1,132.75\u00a0long ton/acre; 1,268.68\u00a0short ton/acre) of carbon.[41]\n\n\n\n### Tallest specimens[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIt is also possible that individual trees will again attain such heights.

Reportedly, the tree was once over 435ft tall, and 110ft in circumference, with a minimum height of 365 feet.[69][70] Now, what is left of the tree is a popular tourist attraction.\n\n\n### Tallest[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n***Sequoiadendron giganteum***, also known as the **giant sequoia**, **giant redwood** or **Sierra redwood** is a coniferous tree, classified in the family Cupressaceae in the subfamily Sequoioideae. Giant sequoia specimens are the most massive trees on Earth.[3] They occur naturally only in groves on the western slopes of the Sierra Nevada mountain range of California.\n\n\nThe giant sequoia is listed as an endangered species by the IUCN, with fewer than 80,000 trees remaining. Since its last assessment as an endangered species in 2011, it was estimated that another 13\u201319% of the population (or 9,761\u201313,637 mature trees) were destroyed during the Castle Fire of 2020 and the KNP Complex & Windy Fire in 2021, events attributed to fire suppression and drought. Prescribed burns to reduce available fuel load may be crucial for saving the species.[4][5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGrowth rates in some areas of Europe are remarkable. One young tree in Italy reached 22\u00a0m (72\u00a0ft) tall and 88\u00a0cm (2.89\u00a0ft) trunk diameter in 17 years (Mitchell, 1972).\n\n\n\n### Northern and Central Europe[edit]\n\n\nGrowth further northeast in Europe is limited by winter cold. In Denmark, where extreme winters can reach \u221232\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221226\u00a0\u00b0F), the largest tree was 35\u00a0m (115\u00a0ft) tall and 1.7\u00a0m (5.6\u00a0ft) diameter in 1976 and is bigger today. One in Poland has purportedly survived temperatures down to \u221237\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221235\u00a0\u00b0F) with heavy snow cover.\n\n\nTwo members of the German Dendrology Society, E. J. Martin and Illa Martin, introduced the giant sequoia into German forestry at the Sequoiafarm Kaldenkirchen in 1952.[48]\n\n\nTwenty-nine giant sequoias, measuring around 30\u00a0m (98\u00a0ft) in height, grow in Belgrade's municipality of Lazarevac in Serbia.[49]\n\n\nThe oldest *Sequoiadendron* in the Czech Republic, at 44\u00a0m (144\u00a0ft), grows in Ratm\u011b\u0159ice u Votic castle garden.\n\n\n\n### United States and Canada[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGrowth in Britain is very fast, with the tallest tree, at Benmore in southwest Scotland, reaching 56.4\u00a0m (185\u00a0ft) in 2014 at age 150 years,[42] and several others from 50\u201353\u00a0m (164\u2013174\u00a0ft) tall; the stoutest is around 12\u00a0m (39\u00a0ft) in girth and 4\u00a0m (13\u00a0ft) in diameter, in Perthshire. The Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew, and in their second campus at Wakehurst, contain multiple large specimens of the species. Biddulph Grange Garden in Staffordshire holds a fine collection of both *Sequoiadendron giganteum* and *Sequoia sempervirens* (coast redwood). The General Sherman of California has a volume of 1,489\u00a0m3 (52,600\u00a0cu\u00a0ft); by way of comparison, the largest giant sequoias in Great Britain have volumes no greater than 90\u2013100\u00a0m3 (3,200\u20133,500\u00a0cu\u00a0ft), one example being the 90\u00a0m3 (3,200\u00a0cu\u00a0ft) specimen in the New Forest.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Opened pollen cones\n![](image)Mature cones and seed\nGiant sequoia specimens are the most massive individual trees in the world.[3] They grow to an average height of 50\u201385\u00a0m (164\u2013279\u00a0ft) with trunk diameters ranging from 6\u20138\u00a0m (20\u201326\u00a0ft). Record trees have been measured at 94.8\u00a0m (311\u00a0ft) tall. Trunk diameters of 17\u00a0m (56\u00a0ft) have been claimed via research figures taken out of context.[9] The specimen known to have the greatest diameter at breast height is the General Grant tree at 8.8\u00a0m (28.9\u00a0ft).[10] Between 2014 and 2016, it is claimed that specimens of coast redwood were found to have greater trunk diameters than all known giant sequoias - though this has not been independently verified or affirmed in any academic literature.[11] The trunks of coast redwoods taper at lower heights than those of giant sequoias which have more columnar trunks that maintain larger diameters to greater heights.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Schmid, R. & Farjon, A.

It occurs from Kangaroo Island, through southeast South Australia, throughout Victoria and Tasmania, mainly east of the tablelands in New South Wales, with a few populations extending into southern Queensland. Thus the overall range of latitude is 28\u2013431\u20442\u00b0S. It occurs from sea level up to elevations of 1,475\u00a0m (4,839\u00a0ft) in the Northern Tablelands of New South Wales. The climate is humid or subhumid, with temperatures ranging from cool to warm, and annual rainfall ranging from 500 to 2,400\u00a0mm (20 to 94\u00a0in). Severe winter frosts are common, severe drought extremely uncommon.[16]\n\n\nIt occurs on a wide range of soils in hilly or mountainous areas. In cool mountainous areas it forms open-forest with other *Eucalyptus* species such as *E. fastigata* (brown barrel), *E. nitens* (shining gum), *E. cypellocarpa* (mountain grey gum), *E. viminalis* (manna gum) and *E. delegatensis* (alpine ash).[16]\n\n\n\n## Uses[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOne of the most important Australian hardwoods, *E. obliqua* is often sold with *E. regnans* (mountain ash) as Victorian ash or Tasmanian oak depending on its origin. It is slightly denser than *E. regnans* \u2013 estimates of density range from 720 to 830\u00a0kg/m (1,500 to 1,700\u00a0lb/yd). The sapwood is pale brown, the heartwood light brown. It has an even texture, with straight grains sometimes interlocked, and well-defined rings. Gum veins are common.[16][17]\n\n\nThe timber has moderate hardness and strength, but low durability. It splits easily, and is easily worked, glued and stained; it is also suitable for steam bending. It is mostly used for pulp production and for construction and manufacture, especially in house building, joinery, flooring, and furniture.[16][17]\n\n\n\n### Gallery[edit]\n\n\n* ![Eucalyptus obliqua in Hospers Grove Maui)](image)\n\n*Eucalyptus obliqua* in Hospers Grove Maui)\n* ![Bark on E. obliqua near Blackburn Lake, Box Hill, Melbourne](image)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Flowers and fruit\n***Eucalyptus obliqua***, commonly known as **messmate stringybark**[3] or **messmate**,[4] but also known as **brown top**, **brown top stringbark**, **stringybark** or **Tasmanian oak**,[5] is a species of tree that is endemic to south-eastern Australia.

The flower buds are arranged in groups of between seven and fifteen in leaf axils on an unbranched peduncle 8\u201320\u00a0mm (0.31\u20130.79\u00a0in) long, the individual buds on a pedicel 3\u20135\u00a0mm (0.12\u20130.20\u00a0in) long. Mature buds are oval to club-shaped, green to yellow or red, 4\u20135\u00a0mm (0.16\u20130.20\u00a0in) long and wide with a conical or rounded operculum with a small point on the tip. Flowering occurs between December and March and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody barrel-shaped to hemispherical capsule 6\u201311\u00a0mm (0.24\u20130.43\u00a0in) long and wide with the valves near rim level or enclosed in the fruit.[3][5][6][7]\n\n\n\n## Taxonomy and naming[edit]\n\n\n*Eucalyptus delegatensis* was first formally described in 1900 by Richard Thomas Baker from a specimen collected by William Baeuerlen, (previously known as Wilhelm B\u00e4uerlen) on \"Delegate Mountain\". The description was published in *Proceedings of the Linnean Society of New South Wales*.[8][9] The specific epithet (*delegatensis*) refers to the type location.[3]\n\n\nIn 1985 Douglas John Boland described two subspecies and the names have been accepted by the Australian Plant Census:\n\n\n\n* *Eucalyptus delegatensis* R.T.Baker subsp. *delegatensis*[10] that has broadly lance-shaped juvenile leaves and is found in New South Wales and Victoria;\n* *Eucalyptus delegatensis* subsp. *tasmaniensis* Boland[11] that has more or less round juvenile leaves with a short \"drip-tip\" and only grows in Tasmania.[12]\n\n\n## Distribution and habitat[edit]\n\n\nAlpine ash is widespread and often dominant in grassy or wet subalpine forest, in deep fertile soil, often on slopes, and commonly forms pure stands. In New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory it is found south from the Brindabella Range and in Victoria it occurs at altitudes between 900 and 1,500\u00a0m (3,000 and 4,900\u00a0ft) east of Mount Macedon. Subspecies *tasmaniensis* is endemic to Tasmania.[6][7]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of *Eucalyptus* species\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Fensham, R.; Laffineur, B.; Collingwood, T.

The species has been listed as endangered by the IUCN, with fewer than 80,000 trees remaining.\n\n2. **Eucalyptus regnans (Mountain Ash):**\n   - **Conservation Status:** Not specified\n   - **Details:** Historically, the tallest individual was claimed to be the Ferguson Tree, at 132.6 meters (435 ft). The species is endemic to southeastern Australia.\n\n3. **Sequoiadendron giganteum (Giant Sequoia):**\n   - **Conservation Status:** Endangered\n   - **Details:** The species is listed as endangered by the IUCN, with fewer than 80,000 trees remaining. The tallest known specimen is the General Sherman tree.\n\n4. **Eucalyptus obliqua (Messmate Stringybark):**\n   - **Conservation Status:** Near Threatened\n   - **Details:** The species is often sold as Victorian ash or Tasmanian oak. It is slightly denser than Eucalyptus regnans and is used for various purposes including pulp production and construction.\n\n5. **Eucalyptus delegatensis (Alpine Ash):**\n   - **Conservation Status:** Least Concern\n   - **Details:** The species is widespread in southeastern Australia and often dominant in grassy or wet subalpine forests. It typically grows to a height of 40-50 m and forms a lignotuber.\n\nThese are the conservation statuses and some details about the five tallest tree species in the world.",
