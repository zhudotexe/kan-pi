Since its last assessment as an endangered species in 2011, it was estimated that another 13–19% of the population (or 9,761–13,637 mature trees) were destroyed during the Castle Fire of 2020 and the KNP Complex & Windy Fire in 2021, events attributed to fire suppression and drought.

Trunk diameters of 17 m (56 ft) have been claimed via research figures taken out of context.[9] The specimen known to have the greatest diameter at breast height is the General Grant tree at 8.8 m (28.9 ft).[10] Between 2014 and 2016, it is claimed that specimens of coast redwood were found to have greater trunk diameters than all known giant sequoias - though this has not been independently verified or affirmed in any academic literature.[11] The trunks of coast redwoods taper at lower heights than those of giant sequoias which have more columnar trunks that maintain larger diameters to greater heights.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Schmid, R. & Farjon, A.

Reportedly, the tree was once over 435ft tall, and 110ft in circumference, with a minimum height of 365 feet.[69][70] Now, what is left of the tree is a popular tourist attraction.\n\n\n### Tallest[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n***Sequoiadendron giganteum***, also known as the **giant sequoia**, **giant redwood** or **Sierra redwood** is a coniferous tree, classified in the family Cupressaceae in the subfamily Sequoioideae. Giant sequoia specimens are the most massive trees on Earth.[3] They occur naturally only in groves on the western slopes of the Sierra Nevada mountain range of California.\n\n\nThe giant sequoia is listed as an endangered species by the IUCN, with fewer than 80,000 trees remaining. Since its last assessment as an endangered species in 2011, it was estimated that another 13–19% of the population (or 9,761–13,637 mature trees) were destroyed during the Castle Fire of 2020 and the KNP Complex & Windy Fire in 2021, events attributed to fire suppression and drought. Prescribed burns to reduce available fuel load may be crucial for saving the species.[4][5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGrowth rates in some areas of Europe are remarkable. One young tree in Italy reached 22 m (72 ft) tall and 88 cm (2.89 ft) trunk diameter in 17 years (Mitchell, 1972).\n\n\n\n### Northern and Central Europe[edit]\n\n\nGrowth further northeast in Europe is limited by winter cold. In Denmark, where extreme winters can reach −32 °C (−26 °F), the largest tree was 35 m (115 ft) tall and 1.7 m (5.6 ft) diameter in 1976 and is bigger today. One in Poland has purportedly survived temperatures down to −37 °C (−35 °F) with heavy snow cover.\n\n\nTwo members of the German Dendrology Society, E. J. Martin and Illa Martin, introduced the giant sequoia into German forestry at the Sequoiafarm Kaldenkirchen in 1952.[48]\n\n\nTwenty-nine giant sequoias, measuring around 30 m (98 ft) in height, grow in Belgrade's municipality of Lazarevac in Serbia.[49]\n\n\nThe oldest *Sequoiadendron* in the Czech Republic, at 44 m (144 ft), grows in Ratměřice u Votic castle garden.\n\n\n\n### United States and Canada[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGrowth in Britain is very fast, with the tallest tree, at Benmore in southwest Scotland, reaching 56.4 m (185 ft) in 2014 at age 150 years,[42] and several others from 50–53 m (164–174 ft) tall; the stoutest is around 12 m (39 ft) in girth and 4 m (13 ft) in diameter, in Perthshire. The Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew, and in their second campus at Wakehurst, contain multiple large specimens of the species. Biddulph Grange Garden in Staffordshire holds a fine collection of both *Sequoiadendron giganteum* and *Sequoia sempervirens* (coast redwood).

It occurs from Kangaroo Island, through southeast South Australia, throughout Victoria and Tasmania, mainly east of the tablelands in New South Wales, with a few populations extending into southern Queensland. Thus the overall range of latitude is 28–431⁄2°S. It occurs from sea level up to elevations of 1,475 m (4,839 ft) in the Northern Tablelands of New South Wales. The climate is humid or subhumid, with temperatures ranging from cool to warm, and annual rainfall ranging from 500 to 2,400 mm (20 to 94 in). Severe winter frosts are common, severe drought extremely uncommon.[16]\n\n\nIt occurs on a wide range of soils in hilly or mountainous areas. In cool mountainous areas it forms open-forest with other *Eucalyptus* species such as *E. fastigata* (brown barrel), *E. nitens* (shining gum), *E. cypellocarpa* (mountain grey gum), *E. viminalis* (manna gum) and *E. delegatensis* (alpine ash).[16]\n\n\n\n## Uses[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOne of the most important Australian hardwoods, *E. obliqua* is often sold with *E. regnans* (mountain ash) as Victorian ash or Tasmanian oak depending on its origin. It is slightly denser than *E. regnans* – estimates of density range from 720 to 830 kg/m (1,500 to 1,700 lb/yd). The sapwood is pale brown, the heartwood light brown. It has an even texture, with straight grains sometimes interlocked, and well-defined rings. Gum veins are common.[16][17]\n\n\nThe timber has moderate hardness and strength, but low durability. It splits easily, and is easily worked, glued and stained; it is also suitable for steam bending. It is mostly used for pulp production and for construction and manufacture, especially in house building, joinery, flooring, and furniture.[16][17]\n\n\n\n### Gallery[edit]\n\n\n* ![Eucalyptus obliqua in Hospers Grove Maui)](image)\n\n*Eucalyptus obliqua* in Hospers Grove Maui)\n* ![Bark on E. obliqua near Blackburn Lake, Box Hill, Melbourne](image)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Flowers and fruit\n***Eucalyptus obliqua***, commonly known as **messmate stringybark**[3] or **messmate**,[4] but also known as **brown top**, **brown top stringbark**, **stringybark** or **Tasmanian oak**,[5] is a species of tree that is endemic to south-eastern Australia.

It occurs from Kangaroo Island, through southeast South Australia, throughout Victoria and Tasmania, mainly east of the tablelands in New South Wales, with a few populations extending into southern Queensland. Thus the overall range of latitude is 28–431⁄2°S. It occurs from sea level up to elevations of 1,475 m (4,839 ft) in the Northern Tablelands of New South Wales. The climate is humid or subhumid, with temperatures ranging from cool to warm, and annual rainfall ranging from 500 to 2,400 mm (20 to 94 in). Severe winter frosts are common, severe drought extremely uncommon.[16]\n\n\nIt occurs on a wide range of soils in hilly or mountainous areas. In cool mountainous areas it forms open-forest with other *Eucalyptus* species such as *E. fastigata* (brown barrel), *E. nitens* (shining gum), *E. cypellocarpa* (mountain grey gum), *E. viminalis* (manna gum) and *E. delegatensis* (alpine ash).[16]\n\n\n\n## Uses[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOne of the most important Australian hardwoods, *E. obliqua* is often sold with *E. regnans* (mountain ash) as Victorian ash or Tasmanian oak depending on its origin. It is slightly denser than *E. regnans* – estimates of density range from 720 to 830 kg/m (1,500 to 1,700 lb/yd). The sapwood is pale brown, the heartwood light brown. It has an even texture, with straight grains sometimes interlocked, and well-defined rings. Gum veins are common.[16][17]\n\n\nThe timber has moderate hardness and strength, but low durability. It splits easily, and is easily worked, glued and stained; it is also suitable for steam bending. It is mostly used for pulp production and for construction and manufacture, especially in house building, joinery, flooring, and furniture.[16][17]\n\n\n\n### Gallery[edit]\n\n\n* ![Eucalyptus obliqua in Hospers Grove Maui)](image)\n\n*Eucalyptus obliqua* in Hospers Grove Maui)\n* ![Bark on E. obliqua near Blackburn Lake, Box Hill, Melbourne](image)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Flowers and fruit\n***Eucalyptus obliqua***, commonly known as **messmate stringybark**[3] or **messmate**,[4] but also known as **brown top**, **brown top stringbark**, **stringybark** or **Tasmanian oak**,[5] is a species of tree that is endemic to south-eastern Australia.

The bark is rough, grey to black, fibrous or stringy on the lower half of the trunk, smooth white to greyish above. Young plants and coppice regrowth have broadly lance-shaped to egg-shaped leaves 70–200 mm (2.8–7.9 in) long and 27–82 mm (1.1–3.2 in) wide. Adult leaves are lance-shaped to curved, the same glossy green to bluish green on both sides, 75–230 mm (3.0–9.1 in) long and 13–55 mm (0.51–2.17 in) wide on a petiole 10–45 mm (0.39–1.77 in) long. The flower buds are arranged in groups of between seven and fifteen in leaf axils on an unbranched peduncle 8–20 mm (0.31–0.79 in) long, the individual buds on a pedicel 3–5 mm (0.12–0.20 in) long. Mature buds are oval to club-shaped, green to yellow or red, 4–5 mm (0.16–0.20 in) long and wide with a conical or rounded operculum with a small point on the tip. Flowering occurs between December and March and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody barrel-shaped to hemispherical capsule 6–11 mm (0.24–0.43 in) long and wide with the valves near rim level or enclosed in the fruit.[3][5][6][7]\n\n\n\n## Taxonomy and naming[edit]\n\n\n*Eucalyptus delegatensis* was first formally described in 1900 by Richard Thomas Baker from a specimen collected by William Baeuerlen, (previously known as Wilhelm Bäuerlen) on \"Delegate Mountain\". The description was published in *Proceedings of the Linnean Society of New South Wales*.[8][9] The specific epithet (*delegatensis*) refers to the type location.[3]\n\n\nIn 1985 Douglas John Boland described two subspecies and the names have been accepted by the Australian Plant Census:\n\n\n\n* *Eucalyptus delegatensis* R.T.Baker subsp. *delegatensis*[10] that has broadly lance-shaped juvenile leaves and is found in New South Wales and Victoria;\n* *Eucalyptus delegatensis* subsp. *tasmaniensis* Boland[11] that has more or less round juvenile leaves with a short \"drip-tip\" and only grows in Tasmania.[12]\n\n\n## Distribution and habitat[edit]\n\n\nAlpine ash is widespread and often dominant in grassy or wet subalpine forest, in deep fertile soil, often on slopes, and commonly forms pure stands. In New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory it is found south from the Brindabella Range and in Victoria it occurs at altitudes between 900 and 1,500 m (3,000 and 4,900 ft) east of Mount Macedon. Subspecies *tasmaniensis* is endemic to Tasmania.[6][7]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of *Eucalyptus* species\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Fensham, R.; Laffineur, B.; Collingwood, T.
