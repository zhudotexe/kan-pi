It is based in Limassol, Cyprus.\n\n\n\n\n## Video format[edit]\n\n\n5-Minute Crafts' YouTube videos are compilations of videos previously posted on Instagram or Facebook.[6][7] The channel's content consists largely of videos relating to crafts and life hacks, styled in how-to formats, and occasionally, science experiments. The channel's videos employ a style where the camera is focused on a table with objects while only a person's hands appear in the frame, making content with aid of these objects, usually food and DIY ingredients and tools.[8]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nTheSoul Publishing was founded by Russia-based entrepreneurs Pavel Radaev and Marat Mukhametov, a team with backgrounds in social media content creation, who launched AdMe.[3][9] In March 2017, the company founded the YouTube channel, Bright Side.[10][11] On November 15, 2016, 5-Minute Crafts was registered on YouTube by TheSoul Publishing.[12] The channel's first video, \"5 essential DIY hacks that you need to know\" was uploaded the following day.[13]\n\n\nIn 2017, the channel's subscriber and video view counts started to grow rapidly. In an article published by Mic in June 2017, 5-Minute Crafts was noted to have accumulated over 4 million subscribers.[14]\n\n\nIn October 2017, 5-Minute Crafts started publishing content in global languages such as Arabic, German, Spanish, French, Portuguese, Japanese, Chinese, Dutch, Italian, Russian and Korean.\n\n\nIn April 2018, *Tubefilter* covered a trend regarding springtime cleaning videos on YouTube, noting 5-Minute Crafts' participation.[15] By November, *Vox* wrote that 5-Minute Crafts was a \"wildly successful\" channel, citing its then over 10 billion video views and its ranking as the fifth most-subscribed channel on YouTube, having nearly 40 million subscribers at the time.[3] During one week in December 2018, the channel received over 238 million video views.[2]\n\n\nIn May 2020, 5-Minute Crafts created their first English-language channel on Pinterest.[16]\n\n\nIn July 2020, 5-Minute Crafts collaborated with Mattel for a custom brand campaign that included multiple DIY videos focused on family-friendly crafts and at-home activities.[17]\n\n\nIn November, 2021, the channel celebrated its 5th anniversary on YouTube, with more than 1.7 billion hours watched and 21 billion views.[18]\nThat same month on November 18, 2021, Variety commented that the 5-minute Crafts Family had the highest-performing YouTube Short to date with nearly 433 million views.[19] \nAs of January, 2022, the channel has 75.4 million subscribers, ranking it as the eleventh most-subscribed channel not operated by YouTube.[5]\n\n\nWith a focus on DIY content, 5-Minute Crafts began to adapt its content for distribution on Pinterest. The activity began by establishing 5-Minute Crafts in English, Spanish and Portuguese. This collaboration with Pinterest was recognised by The Drum Awards for the Digital Industries 2021, winning the \"Best use of Pinterest\" award. [20]\n\n\n\n## Veracity[edit]\n\n\nThe channel has drawn criticism for its unusual and potentially dangerous life hacks and its reliance on clickbait.[3][21][22][23] *Vox* characterized 5-Minute Crafts as \"bizarre\", describing its content as \"do-it-yourself-how-to's that no person could or should ever replicate\", and criticizing the channel's heavy use of clickbait thumbnails.[3] *Mashable* described the channel's videos as \"nonsensical\" and possibly a form of trolling, singling out a video which claimed to demonstrate how soaking an egg in vinegar and then maple syrup will make it \"bigger than before\".[21]\n\n\nBBC's *Click* criticized 5-Minute Crafts for its \"fake kitchen hacks\": when following the instructions of a video in which a fresh corncob produced popcorn when microwaved, the presenter found the cob was only warmed up.[22] Ann Reardon of How to Cook That described clickbait recipe channels including 5-Minute Crafts as the \"fake news of the baking world\", and fact-checked several of their videos on her channel. In particular, she criticized a clip in which a strawberry was soaked in bleach to produce a \"white strawberry\", saying it would be dangerous if a child were to replicate it and eat the result.[22] The segment has since been removed from the video.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of most-subscribed YouTube channels\n* List of most-viewed YouTube channels\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"About 5-Minute Crafts\".
