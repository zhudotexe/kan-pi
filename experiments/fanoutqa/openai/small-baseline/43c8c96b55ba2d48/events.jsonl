Players who were born in U.S. overseas territories, such as Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam, are considered international players even if they are U.S. citizens.[287][288][289][290] In some borderline cases, the NBA takes into consideration whether a player desires to be identified as *international*.[287] 18 international players have played for the Heat. The first foreign-born Heat is Rony Seikaly, who was born in Lebanon. However, he grew up in Greece and played college basketball in the United States for Syracuse University. He was drafted ninth in the first round of the 1988 draft and became the Heat's first-ever draft pick.[291]\n\n\nThe following is a list of international players who have played for the Heat, listed by their national team affiliation.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n126. **^** \"Josh Harrellson NBA Statistics\". *basketball-reference.com*.

Players who were born in U.S. overseas territories, such as Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam, are considered international players even if they are U.S. citizens.[287][288][289][290] In some borderline cases, the NBA takes into consideration whether a player desires to be identified as *international*.[287] 18 international players have played for the Heat. The first foreign-born Heat is Rony Seikaly, who was born in Lebanon. However, he grew up in Greece and played college basketball in the United States for Syracuse University. He was drafted ninth in the first round of the 1988 draft and became the Heat's first-ever draft pick.[291]\n\n\nThe following is a list of international players who have played for the Heat, listed by their national team affiliation.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n126. **^** \"Josh Harrellson NBA Statistics\". *basketball-reference.com*.
