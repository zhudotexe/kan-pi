It includes sovereign states, inhabited dependent territories and, in some cases, constituent countries of sovereign states, with inclusion within the list being primarily based on the ISO standard ISO 3166-1. For instance, the United Kingdom is considered a single entity, while the constituent countries of the Kingdom of the Netherlands are considered separately. In addition, this list includes certain states with limited recognition not found in ISO 3166-1.

It includes sovereign states, inhabited dependent territories and, in some cases, constituent countries of sovereign states, with inclusion within the list being primarily based on the ISO standard ISO 3166-1. For instance, the United Kingdom is considered a single entity, while the constituent countries of the Kingdom of the Netherlands are considered separately. In addition, this list includes certain states with limited recognition not found in ISO 3166-1. Also given in a percentage is each country's population compared with the world population, which the United Nations estimates at 8.11 billion as of 2023[update].[1]\n\n\n\n\n##

The then serving governor-general, Major-General Iskander Mirza, assumed office as the first president. Following the 1958 *coup d'etat*, the office of prime minister was abolished, leaving the Presidency as the most powerful office in the country. This position was further strengthened when the 1962 Constitution was adopted. It turned Pakistan into a Presidential Republic, giving all executive powers to the president. In 1973, the new Constitution established Parliamentary democracy and reduced the president's role to a ceremonial one. Nevertheless, the military takeover in 1977 reversed the changes. The 8th Amendment turned Pakistan into a semi-presidential republic and in the period between 1985 and 2010, the executive power was shared by the president and prime minister. The 18th Amendment in 2010 restored Parliamentary Democracy in the country, and reduced the presidency to a ceremonial position.[6]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFor a comprehensive list, see List of heads of state of Pakistan.\n\nHead of state of Pakistan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe **president of Pakistan** (Urdu: صدرِ پاکستان, romanized: *s̤adr-i Pākistān*) is the head of state of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan.

The then serving governor-general, Major-General Iskander Mirza, assumed office as the first president. Following the 1958 *coup d'etat*, the office of prime minister was abolished, leaving the Presidency as the most powerful office in the country. This position was further strengthened when the 1962 Constitution was adopted. It turned Pakistan into a Presidential Republic, giving all executive powers to the president. In 1973, the new Constitution established Parliamentary democracy and reduced the president's role to a ceremonial one. Nevertheless, the military takeover in 1977 reversed the changes. The 8th Amendment turned Pakistan into a semi-presidential republic and in the period between 1985 and 2010, the executive power was shared by the president and prime minister. The 18th Amendment in 2010 restored Parliamentary Democracy in the country, and reduced the presidency to a ceremonial position.[6]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFor a comprehensive list, see List of heads of state of Pakistan.\n\nHead of state of Pakistan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe **president of Pakistan** (Urdu: صدرِ پاکستان, romanized: *s̤adr-i Pākistān*) is the head of state of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan.
