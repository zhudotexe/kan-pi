RCI also has a sixth *Oasis*-class ship, *Utopia of the Seas*, on order for 2024, and while its exact size is not published, RCI has previously stated that each new *Oasis*-class ship will be a little larger than the last.[161] Celebrity Cruises, which is owned by RCI's parent company Royal Caribbean Group, will introduce two 140,600 GT *Edge*-class ships in 2023 and 2025,[162] and TUI Cruises, a joint venture between Royal Caribbean Group and TUI Group, are introducing a new class of 161,000 GT cruise ships in 2024 and 2026.[163]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nCruise ships are large passenger ships used mainly for vacationing. Unlike ocean liners, they typically embark on round-trip voyages to various ports of call, where passengers may go on tours known as \"shore excursions\".[1] They may carry thousands of passengers in a single trip, and are some of the largest ships in the world by gross tonnage (GT), bigger than many cargo ships. Cruise ships started to exceed ocean liners in size and capacity in the mid-1990s;[2] before then, few were more than 50,000 GT.[3] In the decades since the size of the largest vessels has more than doubled.[4] There have been nine or more new cruise ships added every year since 2001, most of which are 100,000 GT or greater.[5] In the two decades between 1988 and 2009, the largest cruise ships grew a third longer (268 m to 360 m), almost doubled their widths (32.2 m to 60.5 m), doubled the total passengers (2,744 to 5,400), and tripled in volume (73,000 GT to 225,000 GT). \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n17. **^** \"Ship sales and transfers\". *Cruise Industry News*. 22 November 2014.

RCI also has a sixth *Oasis*-class ship, *Utopia of the Seas*, on order for 2024, and while its exact size is not published, RCI has previously stated that each new *Oasis*-class ship will be a little larger than the last.[161] Celebrity Cruises, which is owned by RCI's parent company Royal Caribbean Group, will introduce two 140,600 GT *Edge*-class ships in 2023 and 2025,[162] and TUI Cruises, a joint venture between Royal Caribbean Group and TUI Group, are introducing a new class of 161,000 GT cruise ships in 2024 and 2026.[163]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nCruise ships are large passenger ships used mainly for vacationing. Unlike ocean liners, they typically embark on round-trip voyages to various ports of call, where passengers may go on tours known as \"shore excursions\".[1] They may carry thousands of passengers in a single trip, and are some of the largest ships in the world by gross tonnage (GT), bigger than many cargo ships. Cruise ships started to exceed ocean liners in size and capacity in the mid-1990s;[2] before then, few were more than 50,000 GT.[3] In the decades since the size of the largest vessels has more than doubled.[4] There have been nine or more new cruise ships added every year since 2001, most of which are 100,000 GT or greater.[5] In the two decades between 1988 and 2009, the largest cruise ships grew a third longer (268 m to 360 m), almost doubled their widths (32.2 m to 60.5 m), doubled the total passengers (2,744 to 5,400), and tripled in volume (73,000 GT to 225,000 GT). \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n17. **^** \"Ship sales and transfers\". *Cruise Industry News*. 22 November 2014.
