Different sources often differ by many metres, and the heights given below may well differ from those elsewhere in this encyclopedia. As an extreme example, Ulugh Muztagh on the north Tibetan Plateau is often listed as 7,723 m (25,338 ft) to 7,754 m (25,440 ft), but appears to be only 6,973 m (22,877 ft) to 6,987 m (22,923 ft). Some mountains differ by > 100 m (330 ft) on different maps, while even very thorough current measurements of Mount Everest range from 8,840 m (29,003 ft) to 8,848 m (29,029 ft). These discrepancies serve to emphasize the uncertainties in the listed heights.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAlmost all mountains in the list are located in the Himalaya and Karakoram ranges to the south and west of the Tibetan plateau. All peaks 7,000 m (23,000 ft) or higher are located in East, Central or South Asia in a rectangle edged by Noshaq (7,492 m or 24,580 ft) on the Afghanistan–Pakistan border in the west, Jengish Chokusu (Tuōmù'ěr Fēng, 7,439 m or 24,406 ft) on the Kyrgyzstan–Xinjiang border to the north, Gongga Shan (Minya Konka, 7,556 m or 24,790 ft) in Sichuan to the east, and Kabru (7,412 m or 24,318 ft) on the Sikkim–Nepal border to the south.\n\n\nAs of December 2018[update], the highest peaks on four of the mountains—Gangkhar Puensum, Labuche Kang III, Karjiang, and Tongshanjiabu, all located in Bhutan or China—have not been ascended. The most recent peak to have its first ever ascent is Saser Kangri II East, in India, on 24 August 2011.\n\n\nThe highest mountain outside of Asia is Aconcagua (6,961 m or 22,838 ft), the 189th highest in the world.[7]\n\n\n\n\n## List of world's highest peaks[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThis article is about mountains by height from sea level.

The peak rises over Lhotse, while Nuptse is the ridge on the left.\nThere are at least 108 mountains on Earth with elevations of 7,200 metres (23,622 ft) or greater above sea level.

They are probably quite accurate for the rarely climbed peaks (though omissions were noted), but greatly underestimate the number of ascending parties on the easier and/or more popular mountains, like most eight-thousanders. For instance, Mount Everest has been scaled 2,251 times by individuals up to 2004 .[14]\n7. **^** Given the large differences between multiple \"definitive\" measurements of Mount Everest, the traditional 8,848 m is listed. For more information, see Mount Everest#Surveys.\n8. **^** Cho Oyu's height is 8,188 m according to the Nepal Survey's 1996 topographical map,[15] which represents the best known measurement to date.

Still, heights or prominences may be revised, so that the order of the list may change and even new mountains could enter the list over time. To be safe, the list has been extended to include all 7,200 m (23,622 ft) peaks.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe highest mountains are also not generally the most voluminous. Mauna Loa (4,169 m or 13,678 ft) is the largest mountain on Earth in terms of base area (about 2,000 sq mi or 5,200 km2) and volume (about 10,000 cu mi or 42,000 km3), although, due to the intergrade of lava from Kilauea, Hualalai and Mauna Kea, the volume can only be estimated based on surface area and height of the edifice. Mount Kilimanjaro is the largest non-shield volcano in terms of both base area (245 sq mi or 635 km2) and volume (1,150 cu mi or 4,793 km3). Mount Logan is the largest non-volcanic mountain in base area (120 sq mi or 311 km2).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe highest mountains above sea level are generally not the highest above the surrounding terrain. There is no precise definition of surrounding base, but Denali,[1] Mount Kilimanjaro[2] and Nanga Parbat[3] are possible candidates for the tallest mountain on land by this measure. The bases of mountain islands are below sea level, and given this consideration Mauna Kea (4,207 m (13,802 ft) above sea level) is the world's tallest mountain and volcano, rising about 10,203 m (33,474 ft) from the Pacific Ocean floor. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | Annapurna Himalaya | 28°35′06″N 83°59′24″E﻿ / ﻿28.58500°N 83.99000°E﻿ / 28.58500; 83.99000﻿ (42.

Different sources often differ by many metres, and the heights given below may well differ from those elsewhere in this encyclopedia. As an extreme example, Ulugh Muztagh on the north Tibetan Plateau is often listed as 7,723 m (25,338 ft) to 7,754 m (25,440 ft), but appears to be only 6,973 m (22,877 ft) to 6,987 m (22,923 ft). Some mountains differ by > 100 m (330 ft) on different maps, while even very thorough current measurements of Mount Everest range from 8,840 m (29,003 ft) to 8,848 m (29,029 ft). These discrepancies serve to emphasize the uncertainties in the listed heights.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAlmost all mountains in the list are located in the Himalaya and Karakoram ranges to the south and west of the Tibetan plateau. All peaks 7,000 m (23,000 ft) or higher are located in East, Central or South Asia in a rectangle edged by Noshaq (7,492 m or 24,580 ft) on the Afghanistan–Pakistan border in the west, Jengish Chokusu (Tuōmù'ěr Fēng, 7,439 m or 24,406 ft) on the Kyrgyzstan–Xinjiang border to the north, Gongga Shan (Minya Konka, 7,556 m or 24,790 ft) in Sichuan to the east, and Kabru (7,412 m or 24,318 ft) on the Sikkim–Nepal border to the south.\n\n\nAs of December 2018[update], the highest peaks on four of the mountains—Gangkhar Puensum, Labuche Kang III, Karjiang, and Tongshanjiabu, all located in Bhutan or China—have not been ascended. The most recent peak to have its first ever ascent is Saser Kangri II East, in India, on 24 August 2011.\n\n\nThe highest mountain outside of Asia is Aconcagua (6,961 m or 22,838 ft), the 189th highest in the world.[7]\n\n\n\n\n## List of world's highest peaks[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThis article is about mountains by height from sea level.

They are probably quite accurate for the rarely climbed peaks (though omissions were noted), but greatly underestimate the number of ascending parties on the easier and/or more popular mountains, like most eight-thousanders. For instance, Mount Everest has been scaled 2,251 times by individuals up to 2004 .[14]\n7. **^** Given the large differences between multiple \"definitive\" measurements of Mount Everest, the traditional 8,848 m is listed. For more information, see Mount Everest#Surveys.\n8. **^** Cho Oyu's height is 8,188 m according to the Nepal Survey's 1996 topographical map,[15] which represents the best known measurement to date.

Still, heights or prominences may be revised, so that the order of the list may change and even new mountains could enter the list over time. To be safe, the list has been extended to include all 7,200 m (23,622 ft) peaks.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe highest mountains are also not generally the most voluminous.

Mount Kilimanjaro is the largest non-shield volcano in terms of both base area (245 sq mi or 635 km2) and volume (1,150 cu mi or 4,793 km3). Mount Logan is the largest non-volcanic mountain in base area (120 sq mi or 311 km2).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe highest mountains above sea level are generally not the highest above the surrounding terrain. There is no precise definition of surrounding base, but Denali,[1] Mount Kilimanjaro[2] and Nanga Parbat[3] are possible candidates for the tallest mountain on land by this measure. The bases of mountain islands are below sea level, and given this consideration Mauna Kea (4,207 m (13,802 ft) above sea level) is the world's tallest mountain and volcano, rising about 10,203 m (33,474 ft) from the Pacific Ocean floor. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | Annapurna Himalaya | 28°35′06″N 83°59′24″E﻿ / ﻿28.58500°N 83.99000°E﻿ / 28.58500; 83.99000﻿ (42.

For China and the Baltoro Karakoram, the heights are those of Mi Desheng's \"The Maps of Snow Mountains in China\". For the Hispar Karakoram the heights on a Russian 1:100,000 topo map.[8] seem to be more accurate than the customarily quoted heights probably based on US army maps from the 50s.[9] Elsewhere, unless otherwise indicated, heights are those in [10]\n3. **^** Prominences over 1,500 m were copied from,[11] the remainder corresponds to those listed in [12]\n4. **^** Coordinates were established by comparing topographical maps with satellite images and SRTM-derived terrain maps.
