A shared identity has developed with the motto *\"Bhinneka Tunggal Ika\"* (\"Unity in Diversity\" *literally*, \"many, yet one\"), defined by a national language, cultural diversity, religious pluralism within a Muslim-majority population, and a history of colonialism and rebellion against it. The economy of Indonesia is the world's 16th-largest by nominal GDP and the 7th-largest by PPP. It is the world's third-largest democracy, a regional power and is considered a middle power in global affairs. The country is a member of several multilateral organisations, including the United Nations, World Trade Organization, G20, and a founding member of the Non-Aligned Movement, Association of Southeast Asian Nations, East Asia Summit, D-8 and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Names of Indonesia\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
