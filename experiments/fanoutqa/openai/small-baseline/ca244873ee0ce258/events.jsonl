His feature directorial debut was the neo-noir crime thriller *Following* (1998) which was made on a shoestring budget of $6,000.[1][note 1] Two years later, he directed the psychological thriller *Memento* (2000) which starred Guy Pearce as a man suffering from anterograde amnesia (short-term memory loss) searching for his wife's killers.[3] Similar to his debut feature it had a non-linear narrative structure, and was his breakthrough film.[4] It was acclaimed by critics and was a surprise commercial success.[5] For the film Nolan received his first nomination for the Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing – Feature Film, and for writing its screenplay he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay.[6][7] He next directed the mystery thriller remake *Insomnia* (2002) which starred Al Pacino, Robin Williams, and Hilary Swank.[8] It was his first film for Warner Bros., and was a critical and commercial success.[9][10]\n\n\nIn 2005, Nolan directed Warner Bros' superhero film *Batman Begins* which starred Christian Bale and told an origin story of the title character.[11] The following year, he directed psychological thriller *The Prestige* (2006) in which Bale and Hugh Jackman played rival 19th-century stage magicians.[12] His next film was the sequel to *Batman Begins*, *The Dark Knight*, in which Bale reprised his role as Batman opposite Heath Ledger as the Joker. The film grossed a worldwide total of over $1 billion, and was the highest grossing of 2008.[13] It received eight nominations at the 81st Academy Awards, and Nolan received his second nomination at the Directors Guild of America Awards.[14][15] In 2010, he directed the action film *Inception* starring Leonardo DiCaprio as a thief who leads a team who steal information by entering a person's subconscious.[16] It was nominated for Best Film at the Academy Awards, British Academy Film Awards, and Golden Globe Awards, and Nolan received his third nomination at the Directors Guild of America Awards.[17]\n\n\nTwo years later, he directed *The Dark Knight Rises* (2012), which grossed a worldwide total at the box office of over $1 billion.[18] He followed this by producing Zack Snyder's superhero film *Man of Steel* (2013) and directing the science fiction film *Interstellar* (2014), which starred Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, and Jessica Chastain. It won the Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film.[19] In 2017, Nolan directed the war film *Dunkirk*, for which he received his first nomination for the Academy Award for Best Director.[20] Three years later he directed the science fiction film *Tenet* (2020).[21] His next feature was *Oppenheimer* (2023), a biopic centered on J. Robert Oppenheimer, with Cillian Murphy starring as the titular character.[22]\n\n\n\n\n## Feature films[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Director | Writer | Producer | Notes\n | Ref(s) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1998\n | *Following* | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n | Also cinematographer and editor\n | [23] |\n| 2000\n | *Memento* | Yes\n | Yes\n | No\n |  | [23][24] |\n| 2002\n | *Insomnia* | Yes\n | No\n | No\n |  | [23][24] |\n| 2005\n | *Batman Begins* | Yes\n | Yes\n | No\n |  | [23][24] |\n| 2006\n | *The Prestige* | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n |  | [23][24] |\n| 2008\n | *The Dark Knight* | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n |  | [23][24] |\n| 2010\n | *Inception* | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n |  | [23][24] |\n| 2012\n | *The Dark Knight Rises* | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n |  | [23][24] |\n| 2013\n | *Man of Steel* | No\n | Story\n | Yes\n |  | [23] |\n| 2014\n | *Interstellar* | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n |  | [23][24] |\n| 2017\n | *Dunkirk* | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n |  | [23][24] |\n| 2020\n | *Tenet* | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n |  | [9][25] |\n| 2023\n | *Oppenheimer* | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n |  | [26] |\n\n\n**Executive producer**\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Notes\n | Ref(s) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2014\n | *Transcendence* |  | [23][24] |\n| 2016\n | *Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice* |  | [23][24] |\n| 2017\n | *Justice League* |  | [23][24] |\n| 2019\n | *The Doll's Breath* | Animated short film\n | [27] |\n| 2021\n | *Zack Snyder's Justice League* | Director's cut of 2017's *Justice League* | [28] |\n\n\n## Short films[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Director | Writer | Producer | Cinematographer | Editor | Notes\n | Ref(s) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1989\n | *Tarantella* | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n | No official release, available on Media Burn Independent Video ArchiveCo-directed with Roko Belic | [23][29] |\n| 1996\n | *Larceny* | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n | No official release\n | [23][24] |\n| 1997\n | *Doodlebug* | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n |  | [23] |\n| 2015\n | *Quay* | Yes\n | No\n | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n | Also composerDocumentary short\n | [23] |\n\n\n## Documentary appearances[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Ref(s) |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 2011\n | *These Amazing Shadows* | [24] |\n| 2012\n | *Side by Side* | [23][24] |\n| 2016\n | *Cinema Futures* | [30] |\n| 2018\n | *James Cameron's Story of Science Fiction* | [31] |\n| 2019\n | *Making Waves: The Art of Cinematic Sound* | [32] |\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n\n1. **^** Nolan directed a feature, *Larry Mahoney*, in the mid-1990s, but it was scrapped and never released.[2]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Sims, David (16 March 2016). \"How Memento Set the Framework for Christopher Nolan's Career\". *The Atlantic*.
