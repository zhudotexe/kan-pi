His tenure was characterized by collective leadership and consensus-based rule.[2] These traits made Hu a rather enigmatic figure in the public eye. His administration was known for its focus more on technocratic competence than persona.[3] At the end of his tenure after ten years in office, Hu won praise for retiring voluntarily from all positions. He was succeeded by Xi Jinping.

Prior to Mao's death, the only governmental position Deng held was that of First Vice Premier of the State Council,[57] but Hua Guofeng wanted to rid the Party of extremists and successfully marginalised the Gang of Four. On 22 July 1977, Deng was restored to the posts of vice-chairman of the Central Committee, Vice-chairman of the Military Commission and Chief of the General Staff of the People's Liberation Army.[58]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n***as General Secretary of the Party (1st-ranked)*** |  **Orders of precedence in the People's Republic of China**  | Succeeded\u00a0byZhao Ziyang\n***as Premier of the State Council (3rd-ranked)*** |\n| Preceded\u00a0byYe Jianying\n***as Chairman of the National People's Congress Standing Committee (2nd-ranked)*** |  **Orders of precedence in the People's Republic of ChinaChairman of the Central Military Commission (3rd-ranked)**  | Succeeded\u00a0byZhao Ziyang\n***as Premier of the State Council (4th-ranked)*** |\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Navigation templates for offices held by Deng Xiaoping\n |\n| --- |\n| | * v\n* t\n* e\nParamount leaders of the People's Republic of China\n |\n| --- |\n| * General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party\n* Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party\n |\n| 1.
