After Chinese Communist Party chairman Mao Zedong's death in 1976, Deng gradually rose to supreme power and led China through a series of far-reaching market-economy reforms earning him the reputation as the \"Architect of Modern China\".[5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Deng Xiaoping and Jimmy Carter at the arrival ceremony of Deng's visit to the US (1979)\nFollowing Mao's death on 9 September 1976 and the purge of the Gang of Four in October 1976, Premier Hua Guofeng succeeded as Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party and gradually emerged as the *de facto* leader of China. Prior to Mao's death, the only governmental position Deng held was that of First Vice Premier of the State Council,[57] but Hua Guofeng wanted to rid the Party of extremists and successfully marginalised the Gang of Four. On 22 July 1977, Deng was restored to the posts of vice-chairman of the Central Committee, Vice-chairman of the Military Commission and Chief of the General Staff of the People's Liberation Army.[58]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n***as General Secretary of the Party (1st-ranked)*** |  **Orders of precedence in the People's Republic of China**  | Succeeded byZhao Ziyang\n***as Premier of the State Council (3rd-ranked)*** |\n| Preceded byYe Jianying\n***as Chairman of the National People's Congress Standing Committee (2nd-ranked)*** |  **Orders of precedence in the People's Republic of ChinaChairman of the Central Military Commission (3rd-ranked)**  | Succeeded byZhao Ziyang\n***as Premier of the State Council (4th-ranked)*** |\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Navigation templates for offices held by Deng Xiaoping\n |\n| --- |\n| | * v\n* t\n* e\nParamount leaders of the People's Republic of China\n |\n| --- |\n| * General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party\n* Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party\n |\n| 1.
