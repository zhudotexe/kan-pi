The peregrine achieves its highest velocity not in horizontal level flight, but during its characteristic hunting stoop (vertical flight). While stooping, the peregrine falcon soars to a great height, then dives steeply at speeds of over 320 km/h (200 mph).[1]Assuming the maximum size at 58 cm, its relative speed clocks at 186 body lengths per second during its hunting swoop, the equivalent of a human running at 170 m/s (560 ft/s).\n |\n| 2\n | Golden eagle | 240–320 km/h (150–200 mph)67–89 m/s (220–293 ft/s)[8] | Flight-diving\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Eland | 55–70 km/h (34–43 mph)[62] | Estimated by observing the odometer when an animal ran at its maximum speed, alongside a vehicle on a road.\n |\n| Coyote | 60–65 km/h (37–40 mph)[m] | Coyotes can easily reach 48 km/h (30 mph), and can sprint at 65 km/h (40 mph) when hunting.[95] Even without a front foot, a coyote can still run at around 32 km/h (20 mph).[94] |\n| Big brown bat(flight) | 56–64 km/h (35–40 mph)\n | Big brown bats are reported to be one of the fastest bats reaching speeds of up to 40 mph.[97] |\n| Common dolphin(swimming) | 55–64 km/h (34–40 mph)[n] | Common dolphins are the fastest marine mammals.

Among the fastest animals in the sea is the black marlin, with uncertain and conflicting reports of recorded speeds.[2][3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n**List of animals by speed**\n| Rank\n | Animal\n | Maximum speed\n | Class\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | Peregrine falcon | 389 km/h (242 mph)108 m/s (354 ft/s)[1][7] | Flight-diving\n | The peregrine falcon is the fastest aerial animal, fastest animal in flight, fastest bird, and the overall fastest member of the animal kingdom. The peregrine achieves its highest velocity not in horizontal level flight, but during its characteristic hunting stoop (vertical flight). While stooping, the peregrine falcon soars to a great height, then dives steeply at speeds of over 320 km/h (200 mph).[1]Assuming the maximum size at 58 cm, its relative speed clocks at 186 body lengths per second during its hunting swoop, the equivalent of a human running at 170 m/s (560 ft/s).\n |\n| 2\n | Golden eagle | 240–320 km/h (150–200 mph)67–89 m/s (220–293 ft/s)[8] | Flight-diving\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Eland | 55–70 km/h (34–43 mph)[62] | Estimated by observing the odometer when an animal ran at its maximum speed, alongside a vehicle on a road.\n |\n| Coyote | 60–65 km/h (37–40 mph)[m] | Coyotes can easily reach 48 km/h (30 mph), and can sprint at 65 km/h (40 mph) when hunting.[95] Even without a front foot, a coyote can still run at around 32 km/h (20 mph).[94] |\n| Big brown bat(flight) | 56–64 km/h (35–40 mph)\n | Big brown bats are reported to be one of the fastest bats reaching speeds of up to 40 mph.[97] |\n| Common dolphin(swimming) | 55–64 km/h (34–40 mph)[n] | Common dolphins are the fastest marine mammals.
