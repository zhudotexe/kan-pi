Until 2016, the championship winners could compete in the following year's FIFA Confederations Cup, but were not obliged to do so.[3] From the 2020 edition onwards, the winner competes in the CONMEBOL\u2013UEFA Cup of Champions.\n\n\nThe sixteen European Championship tournaments have been won by ten national teams: Germany and Spain have each won three titles, Italy and France have won two titles, and the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, the Netherlands, Denmark, Greece and Portugal have won one title each. To date, Spain is the only team to have won consecutive titles, doing so in 2008 and 2012.\n\n\nThe most recent championship, held across Europe in 2021 (postponed from 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic), was won by Italy, who lifted their second European title after beating England in the final at Wembley Stadium in London on penalties.[4][5]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Beginnings[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| * UEFA men's club competitions\n\t+ Records and statistics\n\t+ Winning teams\n\t+ Winning managers\n\t+ UEFA coefficient\n* FENIX Trophy\n* Policies\n\t+ Bosman ruling\n\t+ Coaching licences\n\t+ Financial Fair Play Regulations\n\t+ Homegrown Player Rule\n\t+ Respect campaign\n\t+ Stadium categories\n* Issues\n\t+ Proposals for a European Super League\n\t+ UEFA\u2013CONMEBOL memorandum of understanding\n\t+ 2009 European football match-fixing scandal\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nUEFA European Championship winners\n |\n| --- |\n| * **1960:** ![](image)\u00a0Soviet Union\n* **1964:** ![](image)\u00a0Spain\n* **1968:** ![](image)\u00a0Italy\n* **1972:** ![](image)\u00a0West Germany\n* **1976:** ![](image)\u00a0Czechoslovakia\n* **1980:** ![](image)\u00a0West Germany\n* **1984:** ![](image)\u00a0France\n* **1988:** ![](image)\u00a0Netherlands\n* **1992:** ![](image)\u00a0Denmark\n* **1996:** ![](image)\u00a0Germany\n* **2000:** ![](image)\u00a0France\n* **2004:** ![](image)\u00a0Greece\n* **2008:** ![](image)\u00a0Spain\n* **2012:** ![](image)\u00a0Spain\n* **2016:** ![](image)\u00a0Portugal\n* **2020:** ![](image)\u00a0Italy\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n68. **^** \"EURO 2020 to open in Rome, more London games, venues paired\". *UEFA.com*.

France beat bids of Turkey (7\u20136 in voting in the second voting round) and Italy, which had the fewest votes in the first voting round.[60] Euro 2016 was the first to have 24 teams in the finals.[61] This was the third time France have hosted the competition. Portugal, which qualified for the knock-out phase despite finishing third in its group, went on to win the championship by defeating heavily favoured host team France 1\u20130 in the Final, thanks to a goal from Eder in the 109th minute. Cristiano Ronaldo, Portugal's world-renowned striker, came out of the game due to injury in the 25th minute. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* **2020:** ![Europe](image) Uniforia (until quarter-finals) & Uniforia Finale (from semi-finals)\n* **2024:** ![Germany](image) Fussballliebe\n |\n| Video games | * **1992:** ![Sweden](image) *Champions of Europe*\n* **1996:** ![England](image) *UEFA Euro 96 England*\n* **2000:** ![Belgium](image)![Netherlands](image) *UEFA Euro 2000*\n* **2004:** ![Portugal](image) *UEFA Euro 2004*\n* **2008:** ![Austria](image)![Switzerland](image) *UEFA Euro 2008*\n* **2012:** ![Poland](image)![Ukraine](image) *UEFA Euro 2012*\n* **2016:** ![France](image) *Pro Evolution Soccer: UEFA Euro 2016 France*\n* **2020:** ![Europe](image) *eFootball PES 2020* & *2021 Season Update*\n* **2024:** ![Germany](image) *EA Sports FC 24*\n |\n |\n\n| Authority control databases ![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\n |\n| --- |\n| International | * VIAF\n |\n| National | * France\n* BnF data\n* Germany\n* Czech Republic\n\t+ 2\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | 2008 | ![](image)\u00a0Austria![](image)\u00a0\u00a0Switzerland |\n| 14\n | 2012 | ![](image)\u00a0Poland![](image)\u00a0Ukraine |\n| 15\n | 2016 | ![](image)\u00a0France | 24\n | 51\n | 6 groups of 4 teams: 36 matches\n | knockout of 16 teams (round 1 group winners and runners-up, plus four best third-placed teams): 15 matches\n |\n| 16\n | 2020[s 1] | ![](image)\u00a0Europe[s 2] |\n| *17* | *2024* | *![](image)\u00a0Germany* |\n| *18* | *2028* | *![](image)\u00a0England![](image)\u00a0Northern Ireland![](image)\u00a0Republic of Ireland![](image)\u00a0Scotland![](image)\u00a0Wales* |\n| *19* | *2032* | *![](image)\u00a0Italy![](image)\u00a0Turkey* |\n\n\n1. **^** Postponed to 2021 due to the\u00a0COVID-19 pandemic in Europe\n2. **^** Pan\u2013European edition hosted by eleven countries: Azerbaijan, Denmark, England, Germany, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Romania, Russia, Scotland and Spain\n\nUp to 1968 draws were to be broken via a coin toss in all matches but the final, draw in final match was resolved via a replay.\n\n\nNo third place play-off has been played since 1980.\n\n\n\n### Qualifying[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 1992 | ![](image)\u00a0Sweden | **![](image)Denmark** | **2\u20130**Ullevi, Gothenburg | ![](image)Germany | ![](image)\u00a0Netherlands and ![](image)\u00a0Sweden | 8\n |\n| 1996 | ![](image)\u00a0England | **![](image)Germany** | **2\u20131** (g.g.)Wembley Stadium, London | ![](image)Czech Republic | ![](image)\u00a0England and ![](image)\u00a0France | 16\n |\n| 2000 | ![](image)\u00a0Belgium![](image)\u00a0Netherlands | **![](image)France** | **2\u20131** (g.g.)De Kuip, Rotterdam | ![](image)Italy | ![](image)\u00a0Netherlands and ![](image)\u00a0Portugal | 16\n |\n| 2004 | ![](image)\u00a0Portugal | **![](image)Greece** | **1\u20130**Est\u00e1dio da Luz, Lisbon | ![](image)Portugal | ![](image)\u00a0Czech Republic and ![](image)\u00a0Netherlands | 16\n |\n| 2008 | ![](image)\u00a0Austria![](image)\u00a0\u00a0Switzerland | **![](image)Spain** | **1\u20130**Ernst-Happel-Stadion, Vienna | ![](image)Germany | ![](image)\u00a0Russia and ![](image)\u00a0Turkey | 16\n |\n| 2012 | ![](image)\u00a0Poland![](image)\u00a0Ukraine | **![](image)Spain** | **4\u20130**Olimpiyskiy, Kyiv | ![](image)Italy | ![](image)\u00a0Germany and ![](image)\u00a0Portugal | 16\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Regulations of the UEFA European Football Championship 2018\u201320\". *UEFA.com*.

The competition is contested by UEFA members' senior men's national teams, determining the continental champion of Europe. It is the second-most watched football tournament in the world after the FIFA World Cup. The Euro 2012 final was watched by a global audience of around 300 million.[2] The competition has been held every four years since 1960, except for 2020, when it was postponed until 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe, but kept the name Euro 2020. Scheduled to be in the even-numbered year between FIFA World Cup tournaments, it was originally called the **European Nations' Cup** before changing to its current name in 1968. Since 1996, the individual events have been branded as \"**UEFA Euro [year]**\".\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe groups are again played in a league format, where a team plays its opponents once each. The same points system is used (three points for a win, one point for a draw, no points for a defeat). A schedule for the group matches will be drawn up, but the last two matches in a group must kick off simultaneously. The winner and runner-up of each group progress to the next round, where a knockout system is used (the two teams play each other once, the winner progresses), this is used in all subsequent rounds as well. The winners of the quarter-finals matches progress to the semi-finals, where the winners play in the final. If in any of the knockout rounds, the scores are still equal after normal playing time, extra time and penalties are employed to separate the two teams.
