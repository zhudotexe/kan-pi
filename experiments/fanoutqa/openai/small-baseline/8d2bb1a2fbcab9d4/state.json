He was high school valedictorian, a National Merit Scholar,[33][34] and a Silver Knight Award winner in 1982.[33] In his graduation speech, Bezos told the audience he dreamed of the day when mankind would colonize space. A local newspaper quoted his intention \"to get all people off the earth and see it turned into a huge national park\".[35]\n\n\nAfter graduating from high school in 1982, Bezos attended Princeton University. He initially majored in physics but later switched to electrical engineering and computer science.[36] Bezos was a member of the Quadrangle Club, one of Princeton's 11 eating clubs.[37] In addition, he was the president of the Princeton chapter of the Students for the Exploration and Development of Space (SEDS).[38][39] He had a 4.2 GPA and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa and Tau Beta Pi.

He studied psychology and computer science and belonged to Alpha Epsilon Pi and Kirkland House.[23][14][24] In his sophomore year, he wrote a program that he called CourseMatch, which allowed users to make class selection decisions based on the choices of other students and help them form study groups. Later, he created a different program he initially called Facemash that let students select the best-looking person from a choice of photos. Arie Hasit, Zuckerberg's roommate at the time, explained:\n\n\n\n\n> We had books called Face Books, which included the names and pictures of everyone who lived in the student dorms. At first, he built a site and placed two pictures or pictures of two males and two females. Visitors to the site had to choose who was \"hotter\" and according to the votes there would be a ranking.[25]\n> \n> \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nZuckerberg's Facebook started off as just a \"Harvard thing\" until he decided to spread it to other schools, enlisting the help of roommate and co-founder Dustin Moskovitz.[37] They began with Columbia, New York University, Stanford, Dartmouth, Cornell, University of Pennsylvania, Brown, and Yale.[38]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\n**Mark Elliot Zuckerberg** (/\u02c8z\u028ck\u0259rb\u025c\u02d0r\u0261/; born (1984-05-14)May 14, 1984) is an American business magnate, computer programmer, internet entrepreneur, and philanthropist. He co-founded the social media service Facebook and its parent company Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook, Inc.), of which he is executive chairman, chief executive officer and controlling shareholder.[1][2]\n\n\nZuckerberg attended Harvard University, where he launched Facebook in February 2004 with his roommates Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes. Originally launched in only select college campuses, the site expanded rapidly and eventually beyond colleges, reaching one billion users in 2012. Zuckerberg took the company public in May 2012 with majority shares. In 2007, at age 23, he became the world's youngest self-made billionaire. He has since used his funds to organize multiple philanthropic endeavors, including the establishment of the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n45. **^** Zuckerberg, Mark (July 22, 2010), *500 Million Stories*, The Facebook Blog, archived from the original on May 20, 2012, retrieved May 21, 2012\n46. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Levy, Steven (April 19, 2010). \"Geek Power: Steven Levy Revisits Tech Titans, Hackers, Idealists\". *Wired*.
