Obesity is the source of about 15% of all preventable cancers.[5][6][7]\n\n\nIn 2018, Chinese researchers performed a systematic review and comprehensive quantitative meta‐analysis of cohort studies reporting body mass index (BMI) and the risk of 23 cancer types, providing epidemiological evidence supporting the association between BMI and cancer risk.

However, both reduced DNA repair and increased DNA damage are observed in obese individuals.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n### Bladder cancer[edit]\n\n\nObesity is associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer.[23]\n\n\n\n### Breast cancer[edit]\n\n\nObesity has been found to decrease the risk of breast cancer among African and Caucasian women, but increase it among Asian women.[24] Obesity is also associated with decreased survival among women with breast cancer, regardless of whether the cancer is pre- or post-menopausal.[25]\n\n\n\n### Colorectal cancer[edit]\n\n\nBoth general and central obesity are associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC).[26] The relative risk among obese people relative to those of normal weight has been reported to be 1.334.[27] An association between increased BMI and risk of colorectal adenoma has been reported, as has a dose–response relationship between BMI and colorectal adenoma risk.[28][29] Increased BMI also increases all-cause mortality and mortality from CRC specifically among people diagnosed with CRC.[30]\n\n\n\n### Lung cancer[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n31. **^** Yang, Y; Dong, J; Sun, K; Zhao, L; Zhao, F; Wang, L; Jiao, Y (1 March 2013). \"Obesity and incidence of lung cancer: a meta-analysis\". *International Journal of Cancer*. **132** (5): 1162–9. doi:10.1002/ijc.27719.
