Some of the struggles facing Dunham's character Hannah\u2014including being cut off financially from her parents, becoming a writer and making unfortunate decisions\u2014are inspired by Dunham's real-life experiences.[56]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe second season of *Girls* continued to receive critical acclaim. David Wiegland of the *San Francisco Chronicle* said that \"The entire constellation of impetuous, ambitious, determined and insecure young urbanites in *Girls* is realigning in the new season, but at no point in the four episodes sent to critics for review do you feel that any of it is artificial\".[66] Verne Gay of *Newsday* said it is \"Sharper, smarter, more richly layered, detailed and acted\".[67] Ken Tucker of *Entertainment Weekly* felt that \"As bright-eyed and bushy-tailed as it was in its first season, *Girls* may now be even spunkier, funnier, and riskier\".[68] The second season ran on HBO from January 2013 to March 2013, with third and fourth seasons subsequently being renewed. The third season of *Girls* premiered in January 2014 with over one million viewers.[69] The following month, Dunham hosted an episode of *Saturday Night Live* with musical guest The National.[70]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n81. **^** Cascone, Sarah (May 20, 2014). \"Laurie Simmons Casts Daughter Lena Dunham in New Film\". *Artnet.com*.

Dunham asked Kirke to take on a supporting role in her debut film *Tiny Furniture*. Kirke and a number of other friends were called upon as a favour to Dunham since there was not enough money to pay professional actors.[*citation needed*] Although the film turned out to be profitable, Kirke received no payment.[24] Kirke reunited with Dunham in the HBO series *Girls*, appearing in all six seasons from 2011 to 2017 as the character Jessa Johansson. Kirke next had supporting roles in the dark comedy films *Ava's Possessions* and *The Little Hours*. In 2018, Kirke starred alongside her real-life sister Lola Kirke in Emma Forrest's film *Untogether*. The film premiered at the 2018 Tribeca Film Festival.[25]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2012\u20132017\n | *Girls* | Jessa Johansson\n | Main role; 53 episodes\n |\n| 2015\n | *Axe Cop* | Water Queen (voice)\n | Episode: \"The Center of the Ocean\"\n |\n| 2015\n | *The Simpsons* | Candace's Friend (voice)\n | Episode: \"Every Man's Dream\"\n |\n| 2018\n | *Maniac* | Adelaide\n | Miniseries; 5 episodes\n |\n| 2019\n | *High Maintenance* | Herself\n | Episode: \"Breathwork\"\n |\n| 2021\n | *Sex Education* | Hope Haddon\n | Main role, Season 3; 8 episodes\n |\n| 2022\n | *Conversations with Friends* | Melissa\n | Main role; 12 episodes\n |\n| 2023\n | *City on Fire* | Regan Hamilton Sweeney\n | Main role; 8 episodes\n |\n\n\n### Music videos[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n12. **^** Nate Bloom (27 April 2012). \"Jews in the News: Jews Rock Hall of Fame, A Minyan of Marvel Heroes\". *Let My People Grow*.
