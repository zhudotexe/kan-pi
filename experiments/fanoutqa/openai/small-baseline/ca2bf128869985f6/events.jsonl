Power walkers, hand-bikers, wheelchair riders, and a children's marathon (4.2195 kilometres (2.6219 mi), 1/10 of the regular distance)[4] are also part of the marathon weekend, which is organised by SCC EVENTS. The elite running and wheelchair races are part of the World Marathon Majors, an annual series of top level races offering a $1 million prize purse.

Two years later, one of the race's pacemakers, Simon Biwott won the race, after one of the favourites had pulled out in the second half of the race. In 2001, Naoko Takahashi became the first woman to run a sub-2:20 marathon, completing the Berlin Marathon in 2:19:46. The race had continued to be the venue of world records; between 2003 and 2018, seven men's records were set at the race; the most recent remains as the current world record time; Eliud Kipchoge's 2:01:39.[7][8]\n\n\nThe event was held in mid-September in 2000 and 2018, because of a conflict with the Women's Olympic Marathon, and due to German Unity Day preparations, respectively.[9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n15. **^** 2018 Berlin Marathon.

After that, it winds west between Kreuzberg and Neukölln, through Schöneberg, over to Friedenau and Zehlendorf, before turning north back toward the city's center. Looping above Schöneberg, the course comes full circle as it finishes through the Gate.[11]\n\n\nThere have been two other major international marathons in Berlin. At the 1936 Olympic Games and at the 2009 IAAF World Championships, both using different routes. A marathon in Berlin on 14 Oct 1973 was won by Ulrich Hutmacher (GER) with a time of 2:19:32, but that race is not considered to be part of the Berlin Marathon series.\n\n\n\n## Sponsors[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of marathon races in Europe\n* Sport in Berlin\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The event was cancelled in 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic.[3]\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** h:m:s\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe **Berlin Marathon** (German: *Berlin-Marathon*, pronounced [bɛʁˈliːn ˈmaʁatɔn]) is a marathon event held annually on the streets of Berlin, Germany on the last weekend of September. Held annually since 1974,[a] the event includes multiple races over the marathon distance of 42.195 kilometres (26.219 mi), including elite level road running competitions for men and women, a race for the public, an inline skating race, a wheelchair race, and a handcycle race.\n\n\nEvents are split over two days, with skaters competing on the marathon course on Saturday before the running events. Power walkers, hand-bikers, wheelchair riders, and a children's marathon (4.2195 kilometres (2.6219 mi), 1/10 of the regular distance)[4] are also part of the marathon weekend, which is organised by SCC EVENTS. The elite running and wheelchair races are part of the World Marathon Majors, an annual series of top level races offering a $1 million prize purse.

The Chicago Marathon is the fourth-largest race by number of finishers worldwide.[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAnnual Chicago marathons were held from 1905 to the 1920s, but the first race in the present series occurred on September 25, 1977, under the original name the Mayor Daley Marathon, which drew a field of 4,200 runners. The race has been held every year since, except in 1987 when only a half-marathon was run, and in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.[3][4][5] It became among the fastest-growing modern-marathon road races in the world, due in part to its largely fast and flat course which facilitates the pursuit of personal records and world record performances.[6] The race has achieved its elite status among marathons by developing relationships with sponsors who provide prize money to lure elite runners who have produced American and world record performances. Since 2008, the race has been sponsored and organized by Bank of America, and is officially known as the **Bank of America Chicago Marathon**.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"World Marathon Majors\".

The 2000 running was second only to New York.[24] The 1979 and 1980 events, however, continued to be gatherings of amateur runners. By 1982, the race finally had sufficient prize money to attract world class athletes. The 1982 was the first with world class times such as the 2:10:59 by Greg Meyer.[18] By 1983, the Chicago Marathon had achieved its status as one of America's most important marathons. In 1984, Beatrice raised the purse to $250,000 ($50,000 more than New York's).[18] The race had become a legitimate rival to New York and continues to vie for top runners. \n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_UhWp7skTk6Rd6Zjf8aWpOYb8","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

Second-place runner Emmanuel Mutai, also of Kenya, and third-place runner Tsegaye Kebede of Ethiopia also beat the previous record for the event, with times of 2:06:28 and 2:07:14, respectively.[39] Geoffrey Mutai, who won the Boston Marathon earlier in the year, became the first man to win both races in course-record time in the same year. Firehiwot Dado of Ethiopia won the women's race in a time of 2:23:15, her first major marathon victory.[40] Coming second, 4 seconds behind the leader originally from Ethiopia, but now living in the Bronx, was Bizunesh Deba with a time of 2:23:19.[41] There were a world record 46,795 official finishers: 29,867 men and 16,928 women.\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_qS7EnoxKPk70U1sTKMVgkfak","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
