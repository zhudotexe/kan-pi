The site may have been re-discovered and plundered in 1867 by a German businessman, Augusto Berns.[41] Some evidence indicates that the German engineer J. M. von Hassel arrived earlier.

The site may have been re-discovered and plundered in 1867 by a German businessman, Augusto Berns.[41] Some evidence indicates that the German engineer J. M. von Hassel arrived earlier. Maps show references to Machu Picchu as early as 1874.[42] A 1904 atlas designated the site as Huayna Picchu.[14]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMachu Picchu| ![](image)Machu Picchu in 2007\n |\n| ![Map showing location of Machu Picchu in Peru](image)![Map showing location of Machu Picchu in Peru](image)\nShown within Peru\n |\n| Location | Cusco Region, Peru |\n| Coordinates | 13°09′48″S 72°32′44″W﻿ / ﻿13.16333°S 72.54556°W﻿ / -13.16333; -72.54556 |\n| Altitude | 2,430 m (7,972 ft) |\n| History |\n| Founded | c. 1450; 574 years ago (1450) |\n| Abandoned | 1572; 452 years ago (1572)[1] |\n| Cultures | Inca civilization |\n| Site notes |\n| Discovered | Agustín Lizárraga (1902)Hiram Bingham (1911) |\n| Archaeologists | Hiram Bingham |\n| Website | https://www.machupicchu.gob.pe/?lang=en |\n|  |\n| UNESCO World Heritage Site\n |\n| Official name | Historic Sanctuary of Machu Picchu |\n| Type | Mixed |\n| Criteria | i, iii, vii, ix |\n| Designated | 1983 (7th session) |\n| Reference no. | 274 |\n| Region | Latin America and the Caribbean |\n|  |\n|  |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n95. **^** \"Ancient Observatories - Timeless Knowledge\" (PDF). *Stanford University Solar Center*.\n96. **^** Dearborn, Schreiber & White 1987, p. 346.\n97. **^** Dearborn, Schreiber & White 1987, pp. 349–51.\n98. **^** Dearborn, Schreiber & White 1987, p. 349..\n99. **^** Martineau, Kim (14 March 2006). \"Peru Presses Yale on Relics\". *Hartford Courant*.\n100. **^** Mahony, Edmund H.

In 1377, after the Pope's return to Rome, the Colosseum was restored by a religious order called Arciconfraternita del SS. Salvatore ad Sancta Sanctorum, who then inhabited a northern portion of it until as late as the early 19th century.[29][30] The interior of the amphitheater was extensively stripped of stone, which was reused elsewhere, or (in the case of the marble façade) was burned to make quicklime.[20] The iron clamps[20] which held the stonework together were pried or hacked out of the walls, leaving numerous pockmarks which still scar the building today.\n\n\n\n### Modern[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Colosseum\nThe earliest citation for the name Colosseum in Early Modern English is the 1600 translation, by Philemon Holland, of the *Urbis Romae topographia* of Bartolomeo Marliani, which he used in the preparation of his translation of Livy's Augustan era *Ab Urbe Condita Libri*.[9] The text states: \"This Amphitheatre was commonly called Colosseum, of Neroes Colossus, which was set up in the porch of Neroes house.\"[9] Similarly, John Evelyn, translating the Middle French name: *le Colisée* used by the architectural theorist Roland Fréart de Chambray, wrote \"And 'tis indeed a kind of miracle to see that the Colosseum … and innumerable other Structures which seemed to have been built for Eternity, should be at present so ruinous and dilapidated\".[9]\n\n\n\n### Related to the Colossus of Nero statue[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe outer wall is estimated to have required over 100,000 cubic metres (3.5 million cubic feet) of travertine stone which were set without mortar; they were held together by 300 tons of iron clamps.[20] However, it has suffered extensive damage over the centuries, with large segments having collapsed following earthquakes. The north side of the perimeter wall is still standing; the distinctive triangular brick wedges at each end are modern additions, having been constructed in the early 19th century to shore up the wall.

Water was drawn from the river by a series of *purs*, an animal-powered rope and bucket mechanism, into a large storage tank and raised to a large distribution tank. It was passed into three subsidiary tanks, from which it was piped to the complex.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAnother such unsupported theory is that the Taj Mahal was designed by an Italian, Geronimo Vereneo, held sway for a brief period after it was first promoted by Henry George Keene in 1879 who went by a translation of a Spanish work *Itinerario*, (*The Travels of Fray Sebastian Manrique, 1629–1643*). Another theory that a Frenchman, Austin of Bordeaux designed the Taj was promoted by William Henry Sleeman based on the work of Jean-Baptiste Tavernier. These ideas were revived by Father Hosten and discussed again by E.B. Havell and served as the basis for subsequent theories and controversies.[101]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBy the late 19th century, parts of the buildings had fallen into disrepair. At the end of the 19th century, British viceroy Lord Curzon ordered a sweeping restoration project, which was completed in 1908.[63] He also commissioned the large lamp in the interior chamber, modelled after one in a Cairo mosque. During this time, the garden was remodelled with European-style lawns that are still in place today.[64]\n\n\n\n## Threats[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Protective wartime scaffolding in 1942\nIn 1942, the government erected scaffolding to disguise the building in anticipation of air attacks by the Japanese Air Force.[65][66] During the India-Pakistan wars of 1965 and 1971, scaffolding was again erected to mislead bomber pilots.[67]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_Hv3mFdwJeUo8o5betA4WcZah","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

In all, 28 types of precious and semi-precious stone were inlaid into the white marble.[49]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe small town to the south of the Taj, known as Taj Ganji or Mumtazabad, was initially constructed with caravanserais, bazaars and markets to serve the needs of visitors and workers.[83] Lists of recommended travel destinations often feature the Taj Mahal, which also appears in several listings of seven wonders of the modern world, including the recently announced New Seven Wonders of the World, a recent poll with 100 million votes.[84]\n\n\nThe grounds are open from 06:00 to 19:00 hours on weekdays, except on Friday when the complex is open for prayers at the mosque between 12:00 and 14:00 hours. The complex is open for night viewing on the day of the full moon and two days before and after,[85] excluding Fridays and the month of Ramadan.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Taj Mahal\". *UNESCO Culture World Heritage Centre, World Heritage List*.

Water was drawn from the river by a series of *purs*, an animal-powered rope and bucket mechanism, into a large storage tank and raised to a large distribution tank. It was passed into three subsidiary tanks, from which it was piped to the complex.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAnother such unsupported theory is that the Taj Mahal was designed by an Italian, Geronimo Vereneo, held sway for a brief period after it was first promoted by Henry George Keene in 1879 who went by a translation of a Spanish work *Itinerario*, (*The Travels of Fray Sebastian Manrique, 1629–1643*). Another theory that a Frenchman, Austin of Bordeaux designed the Taj was promoted by William Henry Sleeman based on the work of Jean-Baptiste Tavernier. These ideas were revived by Father Hosten and discussed again by E.B. Havell and served as the basis for subsequent theories and controversies.[101]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBy the late 19th century, parts of the buildings had fallen into disrepair. At the end of the 19th century, British viceroy Lord Curzon ordered a sweeping restoration project, which was completed in 1908.[63] He also commissioned the large lamp in the interior chamber, modelled after one in a Cairo mosque. During this time, the garden was remodelled with European-style lawns that are still in place today.[64]\n\n\n\n## Threats[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Protective wartime scaffolding in 1942\nIn 1942, the government erected scaffolding to disguise the building in anticipation of air attacks by the Japanese Air Force.[65][66] During the India-Pakistan wars of 1965 and 1971, scaffolding was again erected to mislead bomber pilots.[67]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_Hv3mFdwJeUo8o5betA4WcZah","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
