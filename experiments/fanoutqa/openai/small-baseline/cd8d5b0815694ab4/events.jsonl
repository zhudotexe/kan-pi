Retrieved April 8, 2017.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn December 2017, Instagram began to allow users to follow hashtags, which display relevant highlights of the topic in their feeds.[158][159] The ability to search \"Recent\" hashtags was temporarily disabled during the 2020 US elections, to prevent the spread of misinformation.[160] In 2022 this was again tested on some users, and in April 2023 the ability to search recent hashtags was removed entirely. Now, users are only able to see a curated selection of \"popular\" posts using a given hashtag. Instagram states that this is to prevent abuse and that hashtags do not help users gain views, but it has been noted that using hashtags is the only free method for a user to reach past their existing followers.[161]\n\n\n\n### Explore[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_JtGEvL94Bt2pQfBoyi5NgzCh","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
