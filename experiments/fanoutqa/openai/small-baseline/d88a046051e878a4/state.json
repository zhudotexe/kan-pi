The accuracy of this count is then tested after the fact, and sometimes statistically significant undercounts or overcounts occur. For example, for the 2020 decennial census, 14 states had significant miscounts ranging from 1.5% to 6.6%. While these adjustments may be reflected in government programs over the following decade, the 10-year representative apportionments discussed below are not changed to reflect the miscount.[4]\n\n\n\n### House of Representatives[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

The accuracy of this count is then tested after the fact, and sometimes statistically significant undercounts or overcounts occur. For example, for the 2020 decennial census, 14 states had significant miscounts ranging from 1.5% to 6.6%. While these adjustments may be reflected in government programs over the following decade, the 10-year representative apportionments discussed below are not changed to reflect the miscount.[4]\n\n\n\n### House of Representatives[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| ![](image)\u00a0New York | 4 | 20,201,249 | 3 | 19,378,102 | 3 | 18,976,457 | 32 | 4.2% | MAtl |\n|
