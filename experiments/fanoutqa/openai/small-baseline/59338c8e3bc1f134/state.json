The games were postponed by one year as part of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on sports.[2] However, the Games was referred to by its original date in all medals, uniforms, promotional items, and other related media in order to avoid confusion in future years.[3][4] A total of 11,417 athletes from 206 nations participated in 339 events in 33 sports across 50 different disciplines.[5][6]\n\n\nOverall, the event saw two records: 93 nations received at least one medal, and 65 of them won at least one gold medal.[7][8] Athletes from the United States won the most medals overall, with 113, and the most gold medals, with 39.[9] Host nation Japan won 27 gold medals surpassing its gold medal tally of 16 at both the 1964 and 2004 summer editions.[10] Athletes from that nation also won 58 medals overall, which eclipsed its record of 41 overall medals won at the previous Summer Olympics.[11]\n\n\nAmerican swimmer Caeleb Dressel won the most gold medals at the games with five.[12] Meanwhile, Australian swimmer Emma McKeon won the greatest number of medals overall, with seven in total.[13] As a result, she tied Soviet gymnast Maria Gorokhovskaya's seven medals at the 1952 summer edition for most medals won at a single games by a female athlete.[14] Bermuda, Qatar, and the Philippines won their nation's first Olympic gold medals.[15] Meanwhile, Burkina Faso, Turkmenistan, and San Marino won their nation's first Olympic medals.[a][15][18]\n\n\n\n\n## Medals[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Olympic medal\n\nThe medals used for the 2020 Summer Olympics were designed by Junichi Kawanishi.[19] They were manufactured using metal extracted from recycled small electronic devices donated by the public.[19] The ribbon uses the traditional Japanese design motifs found in *ichimatsu moyo* (\u5e02\u677e\u6a21\u69d8), a harmonised chequered pattern, and *kasane no irome* (\u91cd\u306d \u306e \u8272\u76ee), a traditional kimono layering technique.[20][21] The case is manufactured from Japanese ash wood dyed with the same colour as the Olympic emblem. The circular lid and the body of the case can be opened like a ring connected by a magnet.[21] The obverse of the medals features Nike, the Greek goddess of victory, in front of Panathenaic Stadium and the Olympic rings.[22]\n\n\nAs a result of safety protocols stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, athletes were presented with their medals on trays, and were asked to put them on themselves (or each other, in the case of team winners), rather than having them placed around their necks by a dignitary.[23]\n\n\n\n## Medal table[edit]\n\n\n![Raven Saunders, Gong Lijiao, and Valerie Adams in 2021.](image)From left to right: Raven Saunders, Gong Lijiao, and Valerie Adams won silver, gold, and bronze respectively during the women's shot put event.[24]\n![Neisi Dajomes in 2021](image)Neisi Dajomes won the gold medal in the women's 76\u00a0kg weightlifting competition, becoming Ecuador's first female gold medalist.[25]\n![\u00cdtalo Ferreira in 2021.](image)\u00cdtalo Ferreira won the gold medal during the men's shortboard surfing event.[26]\n![Daniel St\u00e5hl in 2019](image)Daniel St\u00e5hl won the gold medal in the men's discus throw competition.[27]\n![Damian Warner in 2018](image)Damian Warner won the gold medal in the men's decathlon.[28]\n![Vincent Hancock in 2021](image)Vincent Hancock won a gold medal in the men's skeet competition. He became the first skeet shooter to win three gold medals in Olympic history having previously won in 2008 and 2012.[29]\nSee also: List of 2020 Summer Olympics medal winners\n\nThe medal table is based on information provided by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and is consistent with IOC convention in its published medal tables. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation have won, where nation is an entity represented by a National Olympic Committee (NOC). The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals. \n\n\nIn boxing, judo, karate, taekwondo, and wrestling, two bronze medals are awarded in each weight class.[30][31][32][33] Two gold medals (and no silver) were awarded to Mutaz Essa Barshim and Gianmarco Tamberi for a first-place tie in the men's high jump athletics event.[34] Two bronze medals were awarded to Angelina Melnikova and Mai Murakami for a third-place tie in the women's floor gymnastics event.[35]\n\n\n\nKey\n\u00a0\u00a0\\*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Host nation (Japan)\n\n\n\n2020 Summer

The games were postponed by one year as part of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on sports.[2] However, the Games was referred to by its original date in all medals, uniforms, promotional items, and other related media in order to avoid confusion in future years.[3][4] A total of 11,417 athletes from 206 nations participated in 339 events in 33 sports across 50 different disciplines.[5][6]\n\n\nOverall, the event saw two records: 93 nations received at least one medal, and 65 of them won at least one gold medal.[7][8] Athletes from the United States won the most medals overall, with 113, and the most gold medals, with 39.[9] Host nation Japan won 27 gold medals surpassing its gold medal tally of 16 at both the 1964 and 2004 summer editions.[10] Athletes from that nation also won 58 medals overall, which eclipsed its record of 41 overall medals won at the previous Summer Olympics.[11]\n\n\nAmerican swimmer Caeleb Dressel won the most gold medals at the games with five.[12] Meanwhile, Australian swimmer Emma McKeon won the greatest number of medals overall, with seven in total.[13] As a result, she tied Soviet gymnast Maria Gorokhovskaya's seven medals at the 1952 summer edition for most medals won at a single games by a female athlete.[14] Bermuda, Qatar, and the Philippines won their nation's first Olympic gold medals.[15] Meanwhile, Burkina Faso, Turkmenistan, and San Marino won their nation's first Olympic medals.[a][15][18]\n\n\n\n\n## Medals[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Olympic medal\n\nThe medals used for the 2020 Summer Olympics were designed by Junichi Kawanishi.[19] They were manufactured using metal extracted from recycled small electronic devices donated by the public.[19] The ribbon uses the traditional Japanese design motifs found in *ichimatsu moyo* (\u5e02\u677e\u6a21\u69d8), a harmonised chequered pattern, and *kasane no irome* (\u91cd\u306d \u306e \u8272\u76ee), a traditional kimono layering technique.[20][21] The case is manufactured from Japanese ash wood dyed with the same colour as the Olympic emblem. The circular lid and the body of the case can be opened like a ring connected by a magnet.[21] The obverse of the medals features Nike, the Greek goddess of victory, in front of Panathenaic Stadium and the Olympic rings.[22]\n\n\nAs a result of safety protocols stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, athletes were presented with their medals on trays, and were asked to put them on themselves (or each other, in the case of team winners), rather than having them placed around their necks by a dignitary.[23]\n\n\n\n## Medal table[edit]\n\n\n![Raven Saunders, Gong Lijiao, and Valerie Adams in 2021.](image)From left to right: Raven Saunders, Gong Lijiao, and Valerie Adams won silver, gold, and bronze respectively during the women's shot put event.[24]\n![Neisi Dajomes in 2021](image)Neisi Dajomes won the gold medal in the women's 76\u00a0kg weightlifting competition, becoming Ecuador's first female gold medalist.[25]\n![\u00cdtalo Ferreira in 2021.](image)\u00cdtalo Ferreira won the gold medal during the men's shortboard surfing event.[26]\n![Daniel St\u00e5hl in 2019](image)Daniel St\u00e5hl won the gold medal in the men's discus throw competition.[27]\n![Damian Warner in 2018](image)Damian Warner won the gold medal in the men's decathlon.[28]\n![Vincent Hancock in 2021](image)Vincent Hancock won a gold medal in the men's skeet competition. He became the first skeet shooter to win three gold medals in Olympic history having previously won in 2008 and 2012.[29]\nSee also: List of 2020 Summer Olympics medal winners\n\nThe medal table is based on information provided by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and is consistent with IOC convention in its published medal tables. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation have won, where nation is an entity represented by a National Olympic Committee (NOC). The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals. \n\n\nIn boxing, judo, karate, taekwondo, and wrestling, two bronze medals are awarded in each weight class.[30][31][32][33] Two gold medals (and no silver) were awarded to Mutaz Essa Barshim and Gianmarco Tamberi for a first-place tie in the men's high jump athletics event.[34] Two bronze medals were awarded to Angelina Melnikova and Mai Murakami for a third-place tie in the women's floor gymnastics event.[35]\n\n\n\nKey\n\u00a0\u00a0\\*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Host nation (Japan)\n\n\n\n2020 Summer

If this tie is for gold or silver, there will be a consequent absence of a silver or bronze medal for that event.\n* Some medals that have been revoked have not been re-awarded.\n* Some early events, such as cricket at the 1900 Summer Olympics, had only two entrants.\n* Retroactively awarding gold, silver, and bronze medals for the 1896 and 1900 games results in some anomalies, such as the 100 metre freestyle swimming event in 1896 where no surviving records distinguish the places of those who finished between 3rd and 10th position.\n\n\n## List of NOCs without medals (sortable & unranked)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe results are attributed to the IOC country code as currently displayed by the IOC database. Usually, a single code corresponds to a single National Olympic Committee (NOC). When different codes are displayed for different years, medal counts are combined in the case of a simple change of IOC code (such as from HOL to NED for the Netherlands) or simple change of country name (such as from Ceylon to Sri Lanka). As the medals are attributed to each NOC, not all totals include medals won by athletes from that country for another NOC, such as before independence of that country. Names in italic are national entities that no longer exist. The totals of NOCs are not combined with those of their predecessors and successors.\n\n\n\n![](image)World map showing nations that have won Summer Olympic medals.\n![](image)World map showing nations that have won Winter Olympic medals.\n\n## List of NOCs with medals (sortable & unranked)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe table is pre-sorted by the name of each Olympic Committee, but can be displayed as sorted by any other column, such as the total number of gold medals or total number of overall medals. To sort by gold, silver, and then bronze, sort first by the bronze column, then the silver, and then the gold. The table does not count revoked medals (e.g., due to doping).\n\n\nA total of 156 current and historical NOCs have earned at least one medal. Medal totals in this table are current through the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, People's Republic of China, and all changes in medal standings due to doping cases and medal redistributions up to 5 May 2023 are taken into account.\n\n\n\nSpecial delegation, not an actual nation\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nLists of Olympic medalists\n |\n| --- |\n| **Summer sports** | * Archery\n* Artistic swimming\n* Athletics\n\t+ men\n\t+ women\n\t+ mixed\n* Badminton\n* Baseball\n* Basketball\n* Boxing\n* Canoeing\n\t+ men\n\t+ women\n* Cycling\n\t+ men\n\t+ women\n* Diving\n* Equestrian\n* Fencing\n\t+ men\n\t+ women\n* Field hockey\n* Football\n* Golf\n* Gymnastics\n\t+ men\n\t+ women\n* Handball\n\t+ men\n\t+ women\n* Judo\n* Karate\n* Modern pentathlon\n* Rowing\n\t+ men\n\t+ women\n* Rugby\n\t+ Rugby sevens\n* Sailing\n\t+ by discipline\n\t+ by class\n* Shooting\n* Skateboarding\n* Sport climbing\n* Softball\n* Surfing\n* Swimming\n\t+ men\n\t+ women\n\t+ mixed\n* Table tennis\n* Taekwondo\n* Tennis\n* Triathlon\n* Volleyball\n* Water polo\n\t+ men\n\t+ women\n* Weightlifting\n* Wrestling\n\t+ freestyle\n\t+ Greco-Roman\n |\n| **Winter sports** | * Alpine skiing\n* Biathlon\n* Bobsleigh\n* Cross-country skiing\n* Curling\n* Figure skating\n* Freestyle skiing\n* Ice hockey\n* Luge\n* Nordic combined\n* Short track speed skating\n* Skeleton\n* Ski jumping\n* Snowboarding\n* Speed skating\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nMedal tables of Olympics, Paralympics and World Championships by sport\n |\n| --- |\n| Olympic Games* (Hosts\n* Medals)\n | * Alpine skiing\n* Archery\n* Athletics\n* Badminton\n* Bandy\n* Basketball\n\t+ men\n\t+ women\n* Biathlon\n* Bobsleigh\n* Boxing\n* Canoeing & kayaking\n* Cross-country skiing\n* Curling\n* Cycling\n* Diving\n* Equestrian\n* Field hockey\n* Fencing\n* Figure skating\n* Football\n\t+ men\n\t+ women\n* Freestyle skiing\n* Gymnastics\n* Handball\n* Ice hockey\n* Judo\n* Luge\n* Modern pentathlon\n* Nordic combined\n* Rowing\n* Sailing\n* Shooting\n* Skeleton\n* Ski jumping\n* Snowboarding\n* Speed skating\n\t+ Short track\n* Swimming\n* Synchronized swimming\n* Table tennis\n* Taekwondo\n* Tennis\n* Triathlon\n* Volleyball\n* Water polo\n* Weightlifting\n* Wrestling\n\t+ Greco-Roman\n\t+ Freestyle\n |\n| Paralympic Games* (Hosts\n* Medals)\n | * Alpine skiing\n* Archery\n* Athletics\n* Biathlon\n* Boccia\n* Cross\u2011country skiing\n* Cycling\n* Equestrian\n* Football 5-a-side\n* Football 7-a-side\n* Goalball\n* Ice sledge hockey\n* Judo\n* Powerlifting\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* All-time Paralympic Games medal table\n* All-time Youth Olympic Games medal table\n* Olympic medal table\n* List of first Olympic gold medalists by country\n* List of participating nations at the Summer Olympic Games\n* List of participating nations at the Winter Olympic Games\n* List of multiple Olympic gold medalists\n* List of multiple Olympic gold medalists at a single Games\n* List of multiple Olympic gold medalists in one event\n* List of multiple Olympic medalists\n* List of multiple Olympic medalists at a single Games\n* List of multiple Olympic medalists in one event\n* List of Olympic teams by medals won\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n27. **^** \"All-Time Olympic Games Medal Tally (Summer Olympics)\". *topendsports*.
