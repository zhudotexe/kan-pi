Many of the cast members were writers as well. \"Middle group\" performers are introduced after the main cast by the announcer saying \"...with\" and reading off these performers before ending with featured players.\n\n\nSid Caesar has the distinction of being the only person who has been named an honorary cast member.

She was originally scheduled to host the season 13 finale, a first for a former female cast member. However, *SNL* was canceled due to a 1988 Writers Guild of America strike. Radner's health worsened the following year. Moments before the season 14 finale, news broke of Radner's death. In lieu of the opening monologue Steve Martin, visibly shaken, introduced a replay of the \"Dancing in the Dark\" sketch he and Radner had performed in a 1978 episode;[26] her ex-husband G. E. Smith performed a musical tribute to Radner with the SNL Band.\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSeveral former *SNL* cast members have returned to host the show. The first former cast member to come back and host the show was Chevy Chase in February 1978. While the majority of cast members who also hosted the show were first cast members and then hosted after leaving the show, there have been two cast members who have hosted the show prior to joining the cast: Billy Crystal (he hosted the show twice during the ninth season prior to joining the cast in the tenth season) and Michael McKean (he hosted the show in the tenth season and joined the cast in the nineteenth season). McKean is also the only eventual cast member who first appeared as a musical guest (with Spinal Tap, May 1984).\n\n\nEddie Murphy is the only cast member to have hosted the show while still a cast member. He also holds the distinction of having the longest gap between successive hosting of the show. There was a 35 year and 6 day gap between his second and third hosting of the show.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | ![Green tick](image)Y |  |  | ![Green tick](image)Y |  |  |  |\n| Tony Rosato | 1981\u20131982 | 2\n | ![Green tick](image)Y |  |  |  |  |  | ![Green tick](image)Y |\n| Jon Rudnitsky | 2015\u20132016 | 1\n |  | ![Green tick](image)Y |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Maya Rudolph | 2000\u20132007 | 9\n | ![Green tick](image)Y | ![Green tick](image)Y |  |  | ![Green tick](image)Y |  |  |\n| Andy Samberg | 2005\u20132012 | 7\n | ![Green tick](image)Y | ![Green tick](image)Y |  |  | ![Green tick](image)Y |  | ![Green tick](image)Y |\n| Adam Sandler | 1991\u20131995 | 5\n | ![Green tick](image)Y | ![Green tick](image)Y | ![Green tick](image)Y |  | ![Green tick](image)Y | ![Green tick](image)Y | ![Green tick](image)Y |\n| Horatio Sanz | 1998\u20132006 | 8\n | ![Green tick](image)Y | ![Green tick](image)Y |  | ![Green tick](image)Y |  |  |  |\n| Tom Schiller | 1980 | 1\n |  | ![Green tick](image)Y |  |  |  |  | ![Green tick](image)Y |\n| Rob Schneider | 1990\u20131994 | 4\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Julia Louis-Dreyfus | 1982\u20131985 | 3\n | ![Green tick](image)Y |  |  |  | ![Green tick](image)Y |  |  |\n| Michael Longfellow | 2022\u2013present\n | 2\n |  | ![Green tick](image)Y |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Jon Lovitz | 1985\u20131990 | 5\n | ![Green tick](image)Y |  |  |  | ![Green tick](image)Y | ![Green tick](image)Y |  |\n| Norm Macdonald | 1993\u20131998 | 5\n | ![Green tick](image)Y | ![Green tick](image)Y |  | ![Green tick](image)Y | ![Green tick](image)Y |  | ![Green tick](image)Y |\n| Gail Matthius | 1980\u20131981 | 1\n | ![Green tick](image)Y |  |  | ![Green tick](image)Y |  |  |  |\n| Michael McKean | 1994\u20131995 | 2\n | ![Green tick](image)Y |  |  |  | ![Green tick](image)Y |  |  |\n| Mark McKinney | 1995\u20131997 | 3\n | ![Green tick](image)Y |  |  |  |  |  | ![Green tick](image)Y |\n| Kate McKinnon | 2012\u20132022 | 11\n | ![Green tick](image)Y | ![Green tick](image)Y |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Tim Meadows | 1991\u20132000 | 10\n | ![Green tick](image)Y |  | ![Green tick](image)Y |  |  | ![Green tick](image)Y | ![Green tick](image)Y |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Marx, Nick; Sienkiewicz, Matt; Becker, Ron (2013). \"Introduction: Situating *Saturday Night Live* in American Television Culture\".
