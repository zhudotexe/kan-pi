Let me provide you with a brief explanation:\n\n- Platonic solids are regular, convex polyhedra with congruent faces and the same number of faces meeting at each vertex. The five Platonic solids are the tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, dodecahedron, and icosahedron.\n\n- Dice shapes can vary, but common variations include the cube (regular six-sided die), tetrahedron (four-sided die), octahedron (eight-sided die), dodecahedron (twelve-sided die), and icosahedron (twenty-sided die).\n\nBased on the information provided, the shape that is not a Platonic solid among the common variations of dice shapes is the twenty-sided die (icosahedron).",
