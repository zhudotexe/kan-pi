With the birth of new cosmetics, the\u00a0definition of makeup started to alter in the 1920s. The cosmetics were not used exclusively by women. Men started to use makeup to rebuild their image. Shiseido's scented hair tonics were among their most popular early cosmetics for both men and women, fueled by a reaction to Western distaste for less fragrant traditional hair oil products.[10] Shiseido also began to produce floral perfumes which contributed to the brand's \"De Luxe\" and \"rich\u201d aesthetic.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)The Shiseido building in Ginza, Tokyo.

At that time, cosmetic consumers focused on the selection of the makeup and their uses. The single makeup method of painting the face white was considered outdated.[31] The beauty consumers liked to apply up to seven different colors of face powder including \u2018\u2019 white, yellow, flesh, rose, peony, green and purple\u2019\u2019 to match their skin tone.[32] In order to explore more potential consumers, Shiseido trained beauty advisers, who demonstrated and illustrated the uses of the cosmetics on the on-site demonstration briefing.\n\n\n\n## Animal testing[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n10. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** \"MIT Visualizing Cultures\". *visualizingcultures.mit.edu*.

After a visit to the United States and Europe, Arinobu added a soda fountain to the store. This later grew into the Shiseido Parlor restaurant business, and eventually led to the introduction of ice cream in Japan. The name *Shiseido* derives from a Chinese expression meaning \"praise the virtues of the earth which nurtures new life and brings forth significant values\".[7][8][9]\n\n\nArinobu passed on his company to his son, Shinzo Fukuhara, who became the company's second president in 1913. After Shinzo's experience traveling to Europe and the United States, he became interested in advertising as a large selling point for Shiseido which lead him to dedicate extensive resources to the company's design, much of which can be seen from product packaging and magazines from this time.[10]\n\n\n\n### Expansion[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n26. **^** \"Brands of the Shiseido Company\". *www.corp.shiseido.com*.

This was a face powder with seven colors in a period when white face powders were the norm in Japan.[11] In 1923, the company began expanding its store-base; it now[*timeframe?*] has approximately 25,000 outlets. The company was incorporated as a *kabushiki gaisha* (Japanese joint-stock company) in 1927.[12] In 2017, Shiseido acquired AI and AR developer Giran to get ahead in the tech space. Shisheido plans to use Giaran\u2019s beauty simulation technology to boost its digital sales.[13][14]\n\n\n\n### Early 20th Century[edit]\n\n\nIn 1916, Shiseido transitioned from using historical images of Japanese female beauty to more Western ideals of beauty. The more contemporary images showed women with hair swept up rather than cascading back and incorporated trendy art nouveau style block scripts.[10] This shift in imagery coincided with increasing Western influence in Japan, allowing Shiseido to capitalize on this cultural change.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn January 18, 2017, Shiseido acquired Palo Alto, California-based, digital tech company MATCHCo, a startup described by co-founder and former professional skateboarder, Andy Howell, as \"AI for beauty.\"[27] The MATCHCo technology was rebranded by Shiseido as MADE-2-FIT, a bareMinerals iPhone app which offered \"precise skin tone analysis via a set of simple user scans, with the help of a virtual makeup artist with voice guidance.\"[27] To supplement MatchCo., Shiseido later acquired Giaran Inc., a data driven company, in November, 2017.[28]\n\n\nIn January 2018, the company acquired all of the assets of Olivo Laboratories.[29]\n\n\n\n## Make-up[edit]\n\n\nShiseido produces a line of cosmetics simply called \"The Makeup\" that provide a full range of products including: lip products, powder eye shadows, eye liner pencils, mascara, fluid and compact foundations, concealers, and powder blushes. Their hydro powder eye shadows which have a creamy texture are among *Allure* magazine's top beauty picks.[30]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n## Subsidiaries[edit]\n\n\nA partial list of Shiseido's wholly owned brands and subsidiaries, as well as exclusive licensing agreements.[26]\n\n\n\n### Prestige division[edit]\n\n\n* BAUM\n* BENEFIQUE\n* Cl\u00e9 de Peau Beaut\u00e9\n* Drunk Elephant\n* EFFECTIM\n* IPSA\n* ISSEY MIYAKE\n* NARS\n* narciso rodriguez\n* Serge Lutens\n* Shiseido\n* THE GINZA\n* Tory Burch\n* Ul\u00e9\n\n### Premium division[edit]\n\n\n* ANESSA\n* AQUA LABEL\n* AUPRES\n* d program\n* ELIXIR\n* GRACY\n* HAKU\n* INTEGRATE\n* MAJOLICA MAJORCA\n* MAQuillAGE\n* PRIOR\n* REVITAL\n* SIDEKICK\n* URARA\n\n### Inner Beauty division[edit]\n\n\n* INRYU\n* The Collagen\n\n### Life Quality Beauty division[edit]\n\n\n* Perfect Cover\n\n## Acquisitions[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nCosmetics\n |\n| --- |\n| Face | * Anti-aging cream\n* BB cream\n* Botulinum toxin (Botox)\n* CC cream\n* Concealer\n* Cotton pad\n* Cleanser\n* DD cream\n* Facial\n* Facial toning\n* Foundation\n* Highlighter\n* Moist towelette\n* Moisturizer\n* Permanent makeup\n* Primer\n* Powder\n* Rouge\n* Toner\n* Venetian ceruse\n |\n| Lips | * Lipstick\n* Balm\n* Gloss\n* Liner\n* Stain\n |\n| Eyes | * Blepharoplasty\n* Circle contact lens\n* Eyelash extensions\n* Eyelid glue\n* Eye liner\n* Eye shadow\n* Kohl\n* Mascara\n |\n| Hair | * Conditioner\n* Hair coloring and bleaching\n* Removal\n\t+ chemical\n\t+ electric\n\t+ laser\n\t+ IPL\n\t+ plucking\n\t+ shaving\n\t+ threading\n\t+ waxing\n* Shampoo\n* Sindoor\n* Styling products\n\t+ gel\n\t+ mousse\n\t+ pomade\n\t+ spray\n\t+ wax\n |\n| Nails | * Artificial nails\n* Buffing\n* Manicure\n* Nail polish\n* Pedicure\n |\n| Body | * Cold cream\n* Lotion\n* Peeling\n* Plastic surgery\n* Skin whitening\n* Sunless tanning\n |\n| Related | * Cosmetic electrotherapy\n* Cosmetic ingredients\n* Cosmetics advertising\n* Cosmetic packaging\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1985, Shiseido was the first company to produce sodium hyaluronate (hyaluronic acid/hyaluronan) from non-animal origin sources.[21]\n\n\n\n## Finances and operations[edit]\n\n\nIn the first quarter of 2013, Shiseido made a profit of \u00a52.66 billion (US$26.87 million) on sales of \u00a5162.36bn (US$1.64bn).[22] On 15 July 2013, Shiseido announced it was opening a wholly owned subsidiary in India.[23] On 20 February 2014, Shiseido agreed to sell its Carita and Decl\u00e9or brands to L\u2019Or\u00e9al for \u20ac227.5M (US$312.93M). This sale resulted in Shiseido showing profits despite running into losses.[24]\n\n\nIn November 2023, Shiseido cut their profit forecast and suffered a 14% decline in stock price, the largest drop in a single day since October 2008. Shiseido cited dropping demand in the Chinese market after the Japanese government approved releasing radioactive wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi reactor into the Pacific Ocean. This decision drove Chinese customers to boycott or avoid Japanese cosmetics brands.[25]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
