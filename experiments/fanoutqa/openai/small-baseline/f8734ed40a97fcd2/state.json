They may also be seen in family gatherings, such as Barney and Robin's wedding or Marshall's father's funeral. Ted's children and Marvin W. Eriksen (son of Marshall and Lily) appear in the background of many episodes and key moments without being crucial to many plots.\n\n\nRanjit, Carl, and several other characters often appear because they work in places the main cast frequently visit/hang out at (such as MacLaren's Pub). Characters in relationships with Ted, Barney, or Robin often appear in several episodes within a short period of time, such as Victoria, Nora, or Kevin. Minor characters such as the Slutty Pumpkin or Mary the Paralegal may only appear in one or two episodes, but still play a crucial role in the episodes in which they appear.\n\n\n\n\n## Cast table[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)From left to right: Ted, Robin, Barney, Marshall, Lily.\nThe US sitcom *How I Met Your Mother* premiered on CBS on September 19, 2005.
