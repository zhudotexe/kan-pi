Meanwhile, Prussian worries about the growing French influence in Central Europe sparked the War of the Fourth Coalition in 1806.\n\n\n\n\n## Periodisation[edit]\n\n\nHistorians differ on when the War of the Third Coalition began and when it ended. From the British perspective, the war started when Britain declared war on France on 18 May 1803, but it was still on its own. It was not until December 1804 when Sweden entered into an alliance with the United Kingdom, not until 11 April 1805 when Russia joined the alliance, not until 16 July when Britain and Russia ratified their treaty of alliance, and only thereafter Austria (9 August) and Naples–Sicily (11 September) completed the fully-fledged coalition.[1]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMeanwhile, Bavaria sided with France on 25 August, and Württemberg joined Napoleon on 5 September. No major hostilities between France and any member of the coalition other than Britain (Trafalgar campaign March–November 1805) occurred until the Ulm Campaign (25 September – 20 October 1805). This was in part because Napoleon's planned invasion of the United Kingdom was not called off until 27 August 1805, when he decided to use his invasion force camped at Boulogne against Austria instead.[1]\n\n\nLikewise, no major battles occurred after the Battle of Austerlitz and the signing of the Peace of Pressburg on 26 December 1805, which forced Austria to leave the Third Coalition and cease hostilities against France. Some historians conclude that Austria's departure \"shattered the fragile Third Coalition\"[1] and \"ended the War of the Third Coalition\".[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)France portal\n\n\n* War of the Fourth Coalition\n* List of battles of the War of the Third Coalition\n* List of Napoleonic battles\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** This armed conflict has received various names: \n\n\t* In Russian historiography, it is known as the **Russian-Austro-French War** (Russian: Русско-австро-французская война)\n\t* it is known as the **Austrian campaign of 1805** (French: *Campagne d'Autriche de 1805*) or the **German campaign of 1805** (French: *Campagne d'Allemagne de 1805*)\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThis narrative leaves out the subsequent French invasion of Naples (February–July 1806), which the occupying Anglo-Russian troops hastily evacuated and the remaining Neapolitan forces relatively quickly surrendered. Other scholars argue the southern Italian campaign should be included into the War of the Second Coalition, and criticise ignoring the Mediterranean front by only focusing on land battles in Central Europe and the Trafalgar campaign.[3]\n\n\n\n## Prelude[edit]\n\n\nEurope had been embroiled in the French Revolutionary Wars since 1792. After five years of war, the French Republic subdued the armies of the First Coalition in 1797. A Second Coalition was formed in 1798, but this too was defeated by 1801, leaving Britain the only opponent of the new French Consulate.[4]\n\n\n\n### From Amiens to the Third Coalition[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| **Austrian Empire:**20,000 killed or wounded70,000 captured**Russia:**25,000 killed or wounded25,000 captured**Naples:**20,000 killed, wounded or captured**Total casualties:**160,000 killed, wounded or captured | **France:**13,500 killed37,000 wounded5,000 captured**Italy:**350 killed1,900 wounded**Spain:**1,200 killed1,600 wounded**Bavaria:**300 killed1,200 wounded\n\n---\n\n**Total casualties:**62,050 killed, wounded or captured |\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nWar of the Third Coalition\n |\n| --- |\n| German campaign\n* Bavaria\n* **Ulm campaign**\n\t+ Donauwörth\n\t+ Wertingen\n\t+ Günzburg\n\t+ Haslach-Jungingen\n\t+ Memmingen\n\t+ Elchingen\n\t+ Ulm\n* Mehrnbach\n* Lambach\n* Steyr\n* Amstetten\n* Mariazell\n* Dürenstein\n* Dornbirn\n* Schöngrabern\n* Hanover\n* Wischau\n* **Austerlitz**\n\n\nItalian campaign\n* Verona\n* Caldiero\n* Forano\n* Caldiero pursuit\n* Castelfranco Veneto\n\n\nInvasion of Naples\n* Gaeta\n* Campo Tenese\n* Maida\n* Calabria\n* Mileto\n\n\nTrafalgar campaign\n* Diamond Rock\n* Cape Finisterre\n* **Trafalgar**\n* Cape Ortegal\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFollowing the surrender, Masséna was ordered south by Joseph to support Reynier's II Corps against the British and the Calabrian insurrection. Now severely outnumbered in mainland Italy, the British retreated back to Sicily. However, the revolt was not suppressed until 1807, by which time Masséna had already requested permission to relinquish command. For the first time in the Napoleonic Wars, the French experienced a brutal guerrilla war carried on by a rebellious population. The French gleaned that the only effective way to deal with such an uprising was to implement terror tactics employed by Reynier. This foreshadowed the same problems the French, and in particular Joseph Bonaparte, would face in Spain during the Peninsular War.\n\n\n\n## Results[edit]\n\n\n![](image)All the participants of the War of the Third Coalition.

With Napoleon as their \"Protector\", the confederate states were compelled to leave the Holy Roman Empire, which was dissolved shortly afterward.[67] Prussia saw these and other moves as an affront to its status as the main power of Central Europe and it went to war with France in 1806.\n\n\nIn Italy, the political situation would remain unchanged until 1815, with the British and Sicilian troops guarding the Bourbon King Ferdinand in Sicily and the Napoleonic King of Naples controlling the mainland. In 1808, Joachim Murat became the King of Naples, after Joseph Bonaparte became King of Spain. Murat made various attempts to cross the Strait of Messina, which all ended in failure, despite once managing to secure a foothold in Sicily.\n\n\n\n### Casualties and losses[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Marshal Murat proved instrumental during the Ulm Campaign.\n![](image)General Mack surrenders his army at Ulm.

Pitt scored a significant coup by securing a burgeoning rival as an ally. The Baltic was dominated by Russia, something Britain had been uncomfortable with since the area provided valuable commodities like timber, tar, and hemp, crucial supplies to its Royal Navy.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)In *The Plumb-pudding in danger* (1805), James Gillray caricatured overtures made by Napoleon in January 1805 for a reconciliation with Britain.\nThe nascent Third Coalition came into being in December 1804 when, in exchange for payment, an Anglo-Swedish agreement was signed allowing the British to use Swedish Pomerania as a military base against France (explicitly, the nearby French-occupied Electorate of Hanover, the homeland of the British monarch). The Swedish government had broken diplomatic ties with France in early 1804 after the arrest and execution of Louis Antoine, Duke of Enghien, a royalist émigré who had been implicated (on dubious evidence) in an assassination plot against First Consul Bonaparte. The execution of Enghien shocked the aristocrats of Europe, who still remembered the bloodletting of the Revolution and thus lost whatever conditional respect they may have entertained for Napoleon.[9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Miguel de Álava\n* Maria I of Portugal\n* Prince Regent John of Portugal\n* Count of Feira\n* William, Prince of Orange\n* Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies\n* Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden\n* Prince Charles John of Sweden\n* Louis XVIII\n |\n| Relatedconflicts | * Anglo-Russian War\n* Anglo-Spanish War\n* Anglo-Swedish War\n* Anglo-Turkish War\n* Anglo-Danish War\n\t+ Gunboat War\n* Dano-Swedish War\n* Russo-Swedish War (Finnish War)\n* Franco-Swedish War (Pomeranian War)\n* Russo-Persian War\n* Russo-Turkish War\n* Spanish American wars of independence\n* Swedish–Norwegian War\n* War of 1812\n |\n| Treaties | * Campo Formio\n* Lunéville\n* Amiens\n* Artlenburg\n* Pressburg\n* Finckenstein\n* Tilsit\n* Cintra\n* Schönbrunn\n* Paris (1810)\n* Paris (February 1812)\n* Paris (March 1812)\n* Paris (1814)\n* Tauroggen\n* Ried\n* Chaumont\n* Kiel\n* Mantua\n* Casalanza\n* Fontainebleau (1814)\n* Paris (1815)\n |\n| Miscellaneous | * Bibliography\n* Bourbon Restoration\n* Casualties\n* Congress of Erfurt\n* Continental System\n* Conference of Dresden\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* ![](image) Spain\n* ![Electorate of Bavaria](image) Bavaria\n* ![](image) Württemberg\n* ![](image) Baden\n* ![Kingdom of Etruria](image) Etruria\n |\n| Commanders and leaders |\n| * ![Austrian Empire](image) Francis I\n* ![Austrian Empire](image) Archduke Charles\n* ![Austrian Empire](image) Karl Mack von Leiberich\n* ![United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland](image) William Grenville\n* ![United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland](image) Horatio Nelson **†**\n* ![Russian Empire](image) Alexander I\n* ![Russian Empire](image) Mikhail Kutuzov\n* ![Russian Empire](image) Pyotr Bagration\n* ![Russian Empire](image) Friedrich Wilhelm von Buxhoeveden\n* ![](image) Ferdinand IV\n* ![Sweden](image) Gustav IV Adolf\n | * ![First French Empire](image) Napoleon I\n* ![First French Empire](image) Pierre Augereau\n* ![First French Empire](image) Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte\n* ![First French Empire](image) Jean-Baptiste Bessières\n* ![First French Empire](image) Louis-Nicolas Davout\n* ![First French Empire](image) Jean Lannes\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe French lost 12,000 killed, 22,200 wounded and 5,000 captured in 1805, including 5,300 killed and 22,200 wounded in the Austrian Campaign against the Habsburgs and Russians, 2,100 killed and 5,300 wounded in the Italian Campaign, 4,300 killed and 3,700 wounded in the naval war, 200 killed and 400 wounded in the colonies and 100 killed and 400 wounded in coastal defense duties.[68][69] The 1806 Naples Campaign cost the French 1,500 killed and 5,000 wounded.[69] The Spanish suffered 1,200 killed and 1,600 wounded in the naval war, Bavaria sustained 300 killed and 1,200 wounded in the Austrian Campaign and the Kingdom of Italy lost 100 killed and 400 wounded in the Italian Campaign and 250 killed and 1,500 wounded in the Naples Campaign.[69]\n\n\nThe Austrians lost 20,000 killed and wounded and 70,000 as prisoners.[68] Russian casualties were 25,000 killed and wounded and 25,000 captured.[68] The Neapolitan army of 22,000 was wiped out by the French in 1806, with only 2,000 evacuated to Sicily.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMany regard this incident as one of Napoleon's cruelest acts in war.[62] However, only a few bodies are reported to have been found in the spring of 1806, and it is most likely the incident is a myth.[63]\n\n\n\n## Italian Campaigns[edit]\n\n\n### Venetian front or Italian campaign of 1805[edit]\n\n\nMeanwhile, in Italy, the Austrian *Armee von Italien* under Archduke Charles fought against the French *Armée d'italie* under Marshal Masséna. The French managed to gain a bridgehead over the Adige river at Verona on 18 October, and finally, between 29 and 31 October, the outnumbered French defeated the superior Austrian army in the Battle of Caldiero. In November the Austrians retreated, engaging the French vanguard of d'Espagne in several rear-guard actions. Venice was blockaded by French and Italian troops under St.Cyr. Charles' army finally crossed the Isonzo on 14 November, preventing the French from crossing it.[64]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn 26 December 1805, Austria and France signed the Treaty of Pressburg, which took Austria out of both the war and the Coalition, while it reinforced the earlier treaties of Campo Formio and of Lunéville between the two powers. The treaty confirmed the Austrian cession of lands in Italy to France and in Germany to Napoleon's German allies, imposed an indemnity of 40 million francs on the defeated Habsburgs, and allowed the defeated Russian troops free passage, with their arms and equipment, through hostile territories and back to their home soil. Victory at Austerlitz also prompted Napoleon to create the Confederation of the Rhine, a collection of German client states that pledged themselves to raise an army of 63,000 men. As a direct consequence of those events, the Holy Roman Empire ceased to exist when, in 1806, Francis II abdicated the Imperial throne, becoming Francis I, Emperor of Austria. Those achievements, however, did not establish a lasting peace on the continent. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The strategic situation in Europe in 1805 before the start of the Ulm Campaign and the war\nIn August 1805, Napoleon, Emperor of the French since May of the previous year, turned his army's sights from the English Channel to the Rhine in order to deal with the new Austrian and Russian threats.

Austerlitz effectively brought the Third Coalition to an end, although later there was a small side campaign against Naples, which also resulted in a decisive French victory at the Battle of Campo Tenese.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n1805–1806 conflict during the Napoleonic Wars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| War of the Third Coalition |\n| --- |\n| Part of the Napoleonic Wars and the Coalition Wars |\n| ![War of the third coalition](image)War of the third coalition\nClick an image to load the appropriate article.Left to right, top to bottom:Battles of Ulm, Trafalgar, Durenstein, Schöngrabern and Austerlitz |\n| \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Date | 11 April 1805 – 18 July 1806(1 year and 3 months) |\n| Location | * + Central Europe\n\t+ Italy\n\t+ Atlantic Ocean\n |\n| Result | French victory\n* Treaty of Pressburg\n* Consolidation of the French Empire\n* Creation of the Confederation of the Rhine\n* French conquest of Naples\n* Dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire\n* British naval supremacy confirmed\n* Formation of the Fourth Coalition a few months later\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* McLynn, Frank (1997). *Napoleon: A Biography*.

Meanwhile, Prussian worries about the growing French influence in Central Europe sparked the War of the Fourth Coalition in 1806.\n\n\n\n\n## Periodisation[edit]\n\n\nHistorians differ on when the War of the Third Coalition began and when it ended. From the British perspective, the war started when Britain declared war on France on 18 May 1803, but it was still on its own. It was not until December 1804 when Sweden entered into an alliance with the United Kingdom, not until 11 April 1805 when Russia joined the alliance, not until 16 July when Britain and Russia ratified their treaty of alliance, and only thereafter Austria (9 August) and Naples–Sicily (11 September) completed the fully-fledged coalition.[1]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMeanwhile, Bavaria sided with France on 25 August, and Württemberg joined Napoleon on 5 September. No major hostilities between France and any member of the coalition other than Britain (Trafalgar campaign March–November 1805) occurred until the Ulm Campaign (25 September – 20 October 1805). This was in part because Napoleon's planned invasion of the United Kingdom was not called off until 27 August 1805, when he decided to use his invasion force camped at Boulogne against Austria instead.[1]\n\n\nLikewise, no major battles occurred after the Battle of Austerlitz and the signing of the Peace of Pressburg on 26 December 1805, which forced Austria to leave the Third Coalition and cease hostilities against France. Some historians conclude that Austria's departure \"shattered the fragile Third Coalition\"[1] and \"ended the War of the Third Coalition\".[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)France portal\n\n\n* War of the Fourth Coalition\n* List of battles of the War of the Third Coalition\n* List of Napoleonic battles\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** This armed conflict has received various names: \n\n\t* In Russian historiography, it is known as the **Russian-Austro-French War** (Russian: Русско-австро-французская война)\n\t* it is known as the **Austrian campaign of 1805** (French: *Campagne d'Autriche de 1805*) or the **German campaign of 1805** (French: *Campagne d'Allemagne de 1805*)\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThis narrative leaves out the subsequent French invasion of Naples (February–July 1806), which the occupying Anglo-Russian troops hastily evacuated and the remaining Neapolitan forces relatively quickly surrendered. Other scholars argue the southern Italian campaign should be included into the War of the Second Coalition, and criticise ignoring the Mediterranean front by only focusing on land battles in Central Europe and the Trafalgar campaign.[3]\n\n\n\n## Prelude[edit]\n\n\nEurope had been embroiled in the French Revolutionary Wars since 1792. After five years of war, the French Republic subdued the armies of the First Coalition in 1797. A Second Coalition was formed in 1798, but this too was defeated by 1801, leaving Britain the only opponent of the new French Consulate.[4]\n\n\n\n### From Amiens to the Third Coalition[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| **Austrian Empire:**20,000 killed or wounded70,000 captured**Russia:**25,000 killed or wounded25,000 captured**Naples:**20,000 killed, wounded or captured**Total casualties:**160,000 killed, wounded or captured | **France:**13,500 killed37,000 wounded5,000 captured**Italy:**350 killed1,900 wounded**Spain:**1,200 killed1,600 wounded**Bavaria:**300 killed1,200 wounded\n\n---\n\n**Total casualties:**62,050 killed, wounded or captured |\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nWar of the Third Coalition\n |\n| --- |\n| German campaign\n* Bavaria\n* **Ulm campaign**\n\t+ Donauwörth\n\t+ Wertingen\n\t+ Günzburg\n\t+ Haslach-Jungingen\n\t+ Memmingen\n\t+ Elchingen\n\t+ Ulm\n* Mehrnbach\n* Lambach\n* Steyr\n* Amstetten\n* Mariazell\n* Dürenstein\n* Dornbirn\n* Schöngrabern\n* Hanover\n* Wischau\n* **Austerlitz**\n\n\nItalian campaign\n* Verona\n* Caldiero\n* Forano\n* Caldiero pursuit\n* Castelfranco Veneto\n\n\nInvasion of Naples\n* Gaeta\n* Campo Tenese\n* Maida\n* Calabria\n* Mileto\n\n\nTrafalgar campaign\n* Diamond Rock\n* Cape Finisterre\n* **Trafalgar**\n* Cape Ortegal\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFollowing the surrender, Masséna was ordered south by Joseph to support Reynier's II Corps against the British and the Calabrian insurrection. Now severely outnumbered in mainland Italy, the British retreated back to Sicily. However, the revolt was not suppressed until 1807, by which time Masséna had already requested permission to relinquish command. For the first time in the Napoleonic Wars, the French experienced a brutal guerrilla war carried on by a rebellious population. The French gleaned that the only effective way to deal with such an uprising was to implement terror tactics employed by Reynier. This foreshadowed the same problems the French, and in particular Joseph Bonaparte, would face in Spain during the Peninsular War.\n\n\n\n## Results[edit]\n\n\n![](image)All the participants of the War of the Third Coalition.

With Napoleon as their \"Protector\", the confederate states were compelled to leave the Holy Roman Empire, which was dissolved shortly afterward.[67] Prussia saw these and other moves as an affront to its status as the main power of Central Europe and it went to war with France in 1806.\n\n\nIn Italy, the political situation would remain unchanged until 1815, with the British and Sicilian troops guarding the Bourbon King Ferdinand in Sicily and the Napoleonic King of Naples controlling the mainland. In 1808, Joachim Murat became the King of Naples, after Joseph Bonaparte became King of Spain. Murat made various attempts to cross the Strait of Messina, which all ended in failure, despite once managing to secure a foothold in Sicily.\n\n\n\n### Casualties and losses[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Marshal Murat proved instrumental during the Ulm Campaign.\n![](image)General Mack surrenders his army at Ulm.

Pitt scored a significant coup by securing a burgeoning rival as an ally. The Baltic was dominated by Russia, something Britain had been uncomfortable with since the area provided valuable commodities like timber, tar, and hemp, crucial supplies to its Royal Navy.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)In *The Plumb-pudding in danger* (1805), James Gillray caricatured overtures made by Napoleon in January 1805 for a reconciliation with Britain.\nThe nascent Third Coalition came into being in December 1804 when, in exchange for payment, an Anglo-Swedish agreement was signed allowing the British to use Swedish Pomerania as a military base against France (explicitly, the nearby French-occupied Electorate of Hanover, the homeland of the British monarch). The Swedish government had broken diplomatic ties with France in early 1804 after the arrest and execution of Louis Antoine, Duke of Enghien, a royalist émigré who had been implicated (on dubious evidence) in an assassination plot against First Consul Bonaparte. The execution of Enghien shocked the aristocrats of Europe, who still remembered the bloodletting of the Revolution and thus lost whatever conditional respect they may have entertained for Napoleon.[9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Miguel de Álava\n* Maria I of Portugal\n* Prince Regent John of Portugal\n* Count of Feira\n* William, Prince of Orange\n* Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies\n* Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden\n* Prince Charles John of Sweden\n* Louis XVIII\n |\n| Relatedconflicts | * Anglo-Russian War\n* Anglo-Spanish War\n* Anglo-Swedish War\n* Anglo-Turkish War\n* Anglo-Danish War\n\t+ Gunboat War\n* Dano-Swedish War\n* Russo-Swedish War (Finnish War)\n* Franco-Swedish War (Pomeranian War)\n* Russo-Persian War\n* Russo-Turkish War\n* Spanish American wars of independence\n* Swedish–Norwegian War\n* War of 1812\n |\n| Treaties | * Campo Formio\n* Lunéville\n* Amiens\n* Artlenburg\n* Pressburg\n* Finckenstein\n* Tilsit\n* Cintra\n* Schönbrunn\n* Paris (1810)\n* Paris (February 1812)\n* Paris (March 1812)\n* Paris (1814)\n* Tauroggen\n* Ried\n* Chaumont\n* Kiel\n* Mantua\n* Casalanza\n* Fontainebleau (1814)\n* Paris (1815)\n |\n| Miscellaneous | * Bibliography\n* Bourbon Restoration\n* Casualties\n* Congress of Erfurt\n* Continental System\n* Conference of Dresden\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* ![](image) Spain\n* ![Electorate of Bavaria](image) Bavaria\n* ![](image) Württemberg\n* ![](image) Baden\n* ![Kingdom of Etruria](image) Etruria\n |\n| Commanders and leaders |\n| * ![Austrian Empire](image) Francis I\n* ![Austrian Empire](image) Archduke Charles\n* ![Austrian Empire](image) Karl Mack von Leiberich\n* ![United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland](image) William Grenville\n* ![United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland](image) Horatio Nelson **†**\n* ![Russian Empire](image) Alexander I\n* ![Russian Empire](image) Mikhail Kutuzov\n* ![Russian Empire](image) Pyotr Bagration\n* ![Russian Empire](image) Friedrich Wilhelm von Buxhoeveden\n* ![](image) Ferdinand IV\n* ![Sweden](image) Gustav IV Adolf\n | * ![First French Empire](image) Napoleon I\n* ![First French Empire](image) Pierre Augereau\n* ![First French Empire](image) Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte\n* ![First French Empire](image) Jean-Baptiste Bessières\n* ![First French Empire](image) Louis-Nicolas Davout\n* ![First French Empire](image) Jean Lannes\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe French lost 12,000 killed, 22,200 wounded and 5,000 captured in 1805, including 5,300 killed and 22,200 wounded in the Austrian Campaign against the Habsburgs and Russians, 2,100 killed and 5,300 wounded in the Italian Campaign, 4,300 killed and 3,700 wounded in the naval war, 200 killed and 400 wounded in the colonies and 100 killed and 400 wounded in coastal defense duties.[68][69] The 1806 Naples Campaign cost the French 1,500 killed and 5,000 wounded.[69] The Spanish suffered 1,200 killed and 1,600 wounded in the naval war, Bavaria sustained 300 killed and 1,200 wounded in the Austrian Campaign and the Kingdom of Italy lost 100 killed and 400 wounded in the Italian Campaign and 250 killed and 1,500 wounded in the Naples Campaign.[69]\n\n\nThe Austrians lost 20,000 killed and wounded and 70,000 as prisoners.[68] Russian casualties were 25,000 killed and wounded and 25,000 captured.[68] The Neapolitan army of 22,000 was wiped out by the French in 1806, with only 2,000 evacuated to Sicily.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMany regard this incident as one of Napoleon's cruelest acts in war.[62] However, only a few bodies are reported to have been found in the spring of 1806, and it is most likely the incident is a myth.[63]\n\n\n\n## Italian Campaigns[edit]\n\n\n### Venetian front or Italian campaign of 1805[edit]\n\n\nMeanwhile, in Italy, the Austrian *Armee von Italien* under Archduke Charles fought against the French *Armée d'italie* under Marshal Masséna. The French managed to gain a bridgehead over the Adige river at Verona on 18 October, and finally, between 29 and 31 October, the outnumbered French defeated the superior Austrian army in the Battle of Caldiero. In November the Austrians retreated, engaging the French vanguard of d'Espagne in several rear-guard actions. Venice was blockaded by French and Italian troops under St.Cyr. Charles' army finally crossed the Isonzo on 14 November, preventing the French from crossing it.[64]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn 26 December 1805, Austria and France signed the Treaty of Pressburg, which took Austria out of both the war and the Coalition, while it reinforced the earlier treaties of Campo Formio and of Lunéville between the two powers. The treaty confirmed the Austrian cession of lands in Italy to France and in Germany to Napoleon's German allies, imposed an indemnity of 40 million francs on the defeated Habsburgs, and allowed the defeated Russian troops free passage, with their arms and equipment, through hostile territories and back to their home soil. Victory at Austerlitz also prompted Napoleon to create the Confederation of the Rhine, a collection of German client states that pledged themselves to raise an army of 63,000 men. As a direct consequence of those events, the Holy Roman Empire ceased to exist when, in 1806, Francis II abdicated the Imperial throne, becoming Francis I, Emperor of Austria. Those achievements, however, did not establish a lasting peace on the continent. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The strategic situation in Europe in 1805 before the start of the Ulm Campaign and the war\nIn August 1805, Napoleon, Emperor of the French since May of the previous year, turned his army's sights from the English Channel to the Rhine in order to deal with the new Austrian and Russian threats.
