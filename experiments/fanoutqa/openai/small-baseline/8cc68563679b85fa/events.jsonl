The special administrative regions (特别行政区) of Hong Kong and Macau are not included in this administrative classification.\n\n\nMunicipalities and prefecture-level cities are not each a 'city' in the strictest sense of the term, but are, instead, an administrative unit comprising, typically, both the urban core (*a city in the strict sense*) and surrounding rural or less-urbanized areas.[3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nLargest cities in mainland China by population\n| City | Province | 2020 Census[6] | 2010 Census[7] | % Change\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Shanghai | —\n | 21,909,814\n | 20,217,748\n | +8.37% |\n| Beijing⍟# | —\n | 18,960,744\n | 16,704,306\n | +13.51% |\n| Shenzhen#~ | Guangdong | 17,444,609\n | 10,358,381\n | +68.41% |\n| Guangzhou#\\* | Guangdong\n | 16,096,724\n | 10,641,408\n | +51.26% |\n| Chengdu#\\* | Sichuan | 13,568,357\n | 7,791,692\n | +74.14% |\n| Tianjin#† | —\n | 11,052,404\n | 9,528,277\n | +16.00% |\n| Wuhan#\\* | Hubei | 10,494,879\n | 7,541,527\n | +39.16% |\n| Dongguan | Guangdong\n | 9,644,871\n | 7,271,322\n | +32.64% |\n| Chongqing#\\* | —\n | 9,580,819\n | 6,263,790\n | +52.96% |\n| Xi'an#\\* | Shaanxi | 9,392,938\n | 5,403,052\n | +73.85% |\n| Hangzhou\\* | Zhejiang | 9,236,032\n | 5,849,537\n | +57.89% |\n| Foshan | Guangdong\n | 9,042,509\n | 6,771,895\n | +33.53% |\n| Nanjing\\* | Jiangsu | 7,519,814\n | 5,827,888\n | +29.03% |\n| Shenyang\\* | Liaoning | 7,026,358\n | 5,718,232\n | +22.88% |\n| Zhengzhou#\\* | Henan | 6,461,013\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nLargest cities or municipalities in China*China Urban Construction Statistical Yearbook 2020* Urban Population and Urban Temporary Population\n |\n| --- |\n| |  | Rank | Name | Province | Municipal pop. | Rank | Name | Province | Pop. |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![Shanghai](image)Shanghai![Beijing](image)Beijing | 1 | Shanghai | SH | 24,281,400 | 11 | Hong Kong | HK | 7,448,900\n | ![Guangzhou](image)Guangzhou![Shenzhen](image)Shenzhen |\n| 2 | Beijing | BJ | 19,164,000 | 12 | Zhengzhou | HA | 7,179,400\n |\n| 3 | Guangzhou | GD | 13,858,700 | 13 | Nanjing | JS | 6,823,500\n |\n| 4 | Shenzhen | GD | 13,438,800 | 14 | Xi'an | SN | 6,642,100\n |\n| 5 | Tianjin | TJ | 11,744,400 | 15 | Jinan | SD | 6,409,600\n |\n| 6 | Chongqing | CQ | 11,488,000 | 16 | Shenyang | LN | 5,900,000\n |\n| 7 | Dongguan | GD | 9,752,500 | 17 | Qingdao | SD | 5,501,400\n |\n| 8 | Chengdu | SC | 8,875,600 | 18 | Harbin | HL | 5,054,500\n |\n| 9 | Wuhan | HB | 8,652,900 | 19 | Hefei | AH | 4,750,100\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWhile in 2013 Chongqing had the largest population total of any special municipality, 28 million, only 4.5 million of the people were in the actual Chongqing urban area, with the remainder of the population in suburban and rural areas.[4]\n\n\n\n## List of major cities by population[edit]\n\n\nThe list contains all the cities with the administrative designation of \"national central city\" (国家中心城市) and \"sub-provincial city\" (副省级城市) – including five \"cities with independent planning status\" (计划单列市) and ten large \"provincial capital cities\" (省会城市), as well as some large \"special economic zones\" (经济特区城市), \"open coastal cities\" (沿海开放城市), and \"prefecture-level cities\" (地级市).[5]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Legend:\n⍟ National Capital City\n# National Central City\n\\* Provincial Capital City\n~ Open Coastal City\n† Special Economic Zone\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | Direct-Administered Municipality |\n|  | City with Independent Planning Status |\n|  | Sub-Provincial City |\n|  | Prefecture-Level City |\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"GeoHive – Largest cities (without surrounding urban areas)\". 2016-12-05.
