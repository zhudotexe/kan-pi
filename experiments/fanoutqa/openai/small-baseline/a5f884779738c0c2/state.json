It has an angular diameter of between 8' (rising) and 12' (overhead). Due to its close orbit, it would look smaller when the observer is further away from the Martian equator and is below the horizon and thus not visible from Mars's polar ice caps. Deimos looks more like a bright star or planet for an observer on Mars, only slightly bigger than Venus looks from Earth; it has an angular diameter of about 2'. The Sun's angular diameter as seen from Mars, by contrast, is about 21'. Thus there are no total solar eclipses on Mars, as the moons are far too small to completely cover the Sun. On the other hand, total lunar eclipses of Phobos happen almost every night.[25]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n6. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Close Inspection for Phobos\".

The inner part of the ring formed a large moon. Gravitational interactions between this moon and the outer ring formed Phobos and Deimos. Later, the large moon crashed into Mars, but the two small moons remained in orbit. This theory agrees with the fine-grained surface of the moons and their high porosity. The outer disk would create fine-grained material.[40][41] Simulations suggest the object colliding with Mars had to be within the size range of Ceres and Vesta because a larger impact would have created a more massive disc and moons that would have prevented the survival of tiny moons like Phobos and Deimos.[42]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n### Early speculation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*Curiosity's* view of the Martian moons: Phobos passing in front of Deimos \u2013 in *real-time* (video-gif, 1 August 2013)\nSpeculation about the existence of the moons of Mars had begun when the moons of Jupiter were discovered. When Galileo Galilei, as a hidden report about his having observed two bumps on the sides of Saturn (later discovered to be its rings), used the anagram *smaismrmilmepoetaleumibunenugttauiras* for *Altissimum planetam tergeminum observavi* (\"I have observed the most distant planet to have a triple form\"), Johannes Kepler had misinterpreted it to mean *Salve umbistineum geminatum Martia proles* (Hello, furious twins, sons of Mars).[4]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNatural satellites orbiting Mars\n\n\n\n\n\n![](image)\nEnhanced color image of Phobos (MRO, 23 March 2008)\n![](image)\nEnhanced color image of Deimos (MRO, 21 February 2009)\n\nThe **two moons of Mars** are Phobos and Deimos.[1] They are irregular in shape.[2] Both were discovered by American astronomer Asaph Hall in August 1877[3] and are named after the Greek mythological twin characters Phobos (fear and panic) and Deimos (terror and dread) who accompanied their father Ares into battle. Ares, the god of war, was known to the Romans as Mars.\n\n\nCompared to the Earth's Moon, the moons Phobos and Deimos are small. Phobos has a diameter of 22.2\u00a0km (13.8\u00a0mi) and a mass of 1.08\u00d71016 kg, while Deimos measures 12.6\u00a0km (7.8\u00a0mi) across, with a mass of 2.0\u00d71015 kg. Phobos orbits closer to Mars, with a semi-major axis of 9,377\u00a0km (5,827\u00a0mi) and an orbital period of 7.66 hours; while Deimos orbits farther with a semi-major axis of 23,460\u00a0km (14,580\u00a0mi) and an orbital period of 30.35 hours.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

They are some of the largest objects in the Solar System outside the Sun and the eight planets in terms of mass, larger than any known dwarf planet. Ganymede exceeds (and Callisto nearly equals) even the planet Mercury in diameter, though they are less massive. They are respectively the fourth-, sixth-, first-, and third-largest natural satellites in the Solar System, containing approximately 99.997% of the total mass in orbit around Jupiter, while Jupiter is almost 5,000 times more massive than the Galilean moons.[note 3] The inner moons are in a 1:2:4 orbital resonance. Models suggest that they formed by slow accretion in the low-density Jovian subnebula\u2014a disc of the gas and dust that existed around Jupiter after its formation\u2014which lasted up to 10\u00a0million years in the case of Callisto.[56] Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto are suspected of having subsurface water oceans,[57][58] and Io may have a subsurface magma ocean.[59]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Galilean moons are by far the largest and most massive objects to orbit Jupiter, with the remaining 91 known moons and the rings together composing just 0.003% of the total orbiting mass.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** The most-recently announced moons of Jupiter are S/2022 J 1, S/2022 J 2, and S/2022 J 3, published in MPECs 2023-D44 to 2023-D46.[2] These add three more to the previous count of 92 from January 2023, bringing the total up to 95.[3]\n2. **^** For comparison, the area of a sphere with diameter 250\u00a0km is about the area of Senegal and comparable to the area of Belarus, Syria and Uruguay. The area of a sphere with a diameter of 5\u00a0km is about the area of Guernsey and somewhat more than the area of San Marino. (But note that these smaller moons are not spherical.)\n3. **^** Jupiter Mass of 1.8986\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01027\u00a0kg / Mass of Galilean moons 3.93\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01023\u00a0kg = 4,828\n4. **^** Label refers to the Roman numeral attributed to each moon in order of their naming.\n5. **^** Diameters with multiple entries such as \"60\u2009\u00d7\u200940\u2009\u00d7\u200934\" reflect that the body is not a perfect spheroid and that each of its dimensions has been measured well enough.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThere are 95 moons of Jupiter with confirmed orbits as of 23\u00a0October\u00a02023[update].[1][note 1] This number does not include a number of meter-sized moonlets thought to be shed from the inner moons, nor hundreds of possible kilometer-sized outer irregular moons that were only briefly captured by telescopes.[4] All together, Jupiter's moons form a satellite system called the **Jovian system**. The most massive of the moons are the four Galilean moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto, which were independently discovered in 1610 by Galileo Galilei and Simon Marius and were the first objects found to orbit a body that was neither Earth nor the Sun. Much more recently, beginning in 1892, dozens of far smaller Jovian moons have been detected and have received the names of lovers (or other sexual partners) or daughters of the Roman god Jupiter or his Greek equivalent Zeus. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)The Galilean moons. From left to right, in order of increasing distance from Jupiter: Io; Europa; Ganymede; Callisto.\nThe physical and orbital characteristics of the moons vary widely. The four Galileans are all over 3,100 kilometres (1,900\u00a0mi) in diameter; the largest Galilean, Ganymede, is the ninth largest object in the Solar System, after the Sun and seven of the planets, Ganymede being larger than Mercury. All other Jovian moons are less than 250 kilometres (160\u00a0mi) in diameter, with most barely exceeding 5 kilometres (3.1\u00a0mi).[note 2] Their orbital shapes range from nearly perfectly circular to highly eccentric and inclined, and many revolve in the direction opposite to Jupiter's rotation (retrograde motion). Orbital periods range from seven hours (taking less time than Jupiter does to rotate around its axis), to almost three Earth years.\n\n\n\n## Origin and evolution[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Orbital diagram of the orbital inclination and orbital distances for Jupiter's rings and moon system at various scales. Notable moons, moon groups, and rings are individually labeled. Open the image for full resolution.\nThe moons of Jupiter are listed below by orbital period. Moons massive enough for their surfaces to have collapsed into a spheroid are highlighted in bold. These are the four Galilean moons, which are comparable in size to the Moon. The other moons are much smaller, with the least massive Galilean moon being more than 7,000 times more massive than the most massive of the other moons. The irregular captured moons are shaded light gray and orange when prograde and yellow, red, and dark gray when retrograde.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)A montage of Jupiter and its four largest moons (distance and sizes not to scale)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)The relative masses of the Jovian moons. Those smaller than Europa are not visible at this scale, and combined would only be visible at 100\u00d7 magnification.\nJupiter's regular satellites are believed to have formed from a circumplanetary disk, a ring of accreting gas and solid debris analogous to a protoplanetary disk.[6][7] They may be the remnants of a score of Galilean-mass satellites that formed early in Jupiter's history.[6][8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOf Jupiter's moons, eight are regular satellites with prograde and nearly circular orbits that are not greatly inclined with respect to Jupiter's equatorial plane. The Galilean satellites are nearly spherical in shape due to their planetary mass, and are just massive enough that they would be considered major planets if they were in direct orbit around the Sun. The other four regular satellites, known as the inner moons, are much smaller and closer to Jupiter; these serve as sources of the dust that makes up Jupiter's rings. The remainder of Jupiter's moons are outer irregular satellites whose prograde and retrograde orbits are much farther from Jupiter and have high inclinations and eccentricities. The largest of these moons were likely asteroids that were captured from solar orbits by Jupiter before impacts with other small bodies shattered them into many kilometer-sized fragments, forming collisional families of moons sharing similar orbits. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* ***Inner satellites*** or ***Amalthea group***: Metis, Adrastea, Amalthea, and Thebe. These orbit very close to Jupiter; the innermost two orbit in less than a Jovian day. The latter two are respectively the fifth and seventh largest moons in the Jovian system. Observations suggest that at least the largest member, Amalthea, did not form on its present orbit, but farther from the planet, or that it is a captured Solar System body.[53] These moons, along with a number of seen and as-yet-unseen inner moonlets (see Amalthea moonlets), replenish and maintain Jupiter's faint ring system. Metis and Adrastea help to maintain Jupiter's main ring, whereas Amalthea and Thebe each maintain their own faint outer rings.[54][55]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNatural satellites of the planet Jupiter\n\nFor other uses, see Moons of Jupiter (disambiguation).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Galilean moons around Jupiter \u00a0\u00a0Jupiter\u00a0**\u00b7** \u00a0\u00a0Io\u00a0**\u00b7** \u00a0\u00a0Europa\u00a0**\u00b7** \u00a0\u00a0Ganymede\u00a0**\u00b7** \u00a0\u00a0Callisto\n![](image)Orbits of Jupiter's inner moons within its rings\nThe Galilean moons of Jupiter (Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto) were named by Simon Marius soon after their discovery in 1610.[44] However, these names fell out of favor until the 20th century. The astronomical literature instead simply referred to \"Jupiter I\", \"Jupiter II\", etc., or \"the first satellite of Jupiter\", \"Jupiter's second satellite\", and so on.[44] The names Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto became popular in the mid-20th century,[45] whereas the rest of the moons remained unnamed and were usually numbered in Roman numerals V (5) to XII (12).[46][47] Jupiter V was discovered in 1892 and given the name *Amalthea* by a popular though unofficial convention, a name first used by French astronomer Camille Flammarion.[48][49]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nNatural satellites of the Solar System\n |\n| --- |\n| Planetarysatellites of | * Earth\n* Mars\n* Jupiter\n* Saturn\n* Uranus\n* Neptune\n | ![](image)![](image)![](image)\n |\n| Dwarf planetsatellites of | * Orcus\n* Pluto\n* Haumea\n* Quaoar\n* Makemake\n* Gonggong\n* Eris\n |\n| Minor-planetmoons | Near-Earth\nFlorence\nDidymos\nDimorphos\nMoshup\nSquannit\n1994 CC\n2001 SN263\nMain belt\nKalliope\nLinus\nEuphrosyne\nDaphne\nPeneius\nEugenia\nPetit-Prince\nSylvia\nRomulus\nRemus\nMinerva\nAegis\nGorgoneion\nCamilla\nElektra\nKleopatra\nAlexhelios\nCleoselene\nIda\nDactyl\nRoxane\nOlympias\nPulcova\nBalam\nDinkinesh (Selam)\nJupiter trojans\nPatroclus\nMenoetius\nHektor\nSkamandrios\nEurybates\nQueta\nTNOs\nLempo\nHiisi\nPaha\n2002 UX25\nSila\u2013Nunam\nSalacia\nActaea\nVarda\nIlmar\u00eb\nG\u01c3k\u00fan\u01c1\u02bch\u00f2md\u00edm\u00e0\nG\u01c3\u00f2\u02bc\u00e9 \u01c3H\u00fa\n2013 FY27\n |\n| Rankedby size | * Ganymede\n\t+ **largest**: 5268 km / 0.413 Earths\n* Titan\n* Callisto\n* Io\n* Moon\n* Europa\n* Triton\n* Titania\n* Rhea\n* Oberon\n* Iapetus\n* Charon\n* Umbriel\n* Ariel\n* Dione\n* Tethys\n* Dysnomia\n* Enceladus\n* Miranda\n* Vanth\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nGanymede's larger mass means that it would have migrated inward at a faster rate than Europa or Io.[6] Tidal dissipation in the Jovian system is still ongoing and Callisto will likely be captured into the resonance in about 1.5 billion years, creating a 1:2:4:8 chain.[9]\n\n\nThe outer, irregular moons are thought to have originated from captured asteroids, whereas the protolunar disk was still massive enough to absorb much of their momentum and thus capture them into orbit. Many are believed to have been broken up by mechanical stresses during capture, or afterward by collisions with other small bodies, producing the moons we see today.[10]\n\n\n\n## History and discovery[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Timeline of discovery of Solar System planets and their moons\n\n### Visual observations[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
