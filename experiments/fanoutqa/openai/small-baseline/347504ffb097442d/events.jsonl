The Indians had home-field advantage because the AL had won the 2016 All-Star Game.[2][3][4] This was the final World Series to have home-field advantage determined by the All-Star Game results; since 2017, home-field advantage has been awarded to the team with the better record.

Steve Pearce won the World Series Most Valuable Player Award, while Alex Cora became the fifth first-season manager[3] and first manager from Puerto Rico[4] to win the World Series. The Series was notable for its third game which lasted 18 innings, a World Series record.\n\n\nThe 2018 World Series was the first since 2000 to feature two teams which had also reached the postseason in the prior year. Additionally, the Red Sox became the first team to win two World Series exactly one century apart, as they had defeated the Chicago Cubs in 1918, while the Dodgers were the first team since the 2011 Texas Rangers, and the first NL team since the 1992 Atlanta Braves, to lose consecutive World Series.\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2018 Major League Baseball postseason\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe 2018 Dodgers were the first team to make the World Series by winning their tie-breaker game since the 2007 Colorado Rockies, who also faced and lost to Boston in that World Series. This was the Dodgers' fifth back-to-back World Series appearance (Two came in Brooklyn in 1952–1953 and 1955–1956, and two came in Los Angeles in 1965–1966 and 1977–1978), and the first time since the 2014-15 Kansas City Royals to win back-to-back League Championship Series. Overall, this was the Dodgers' 20th World Series appearance.[18]\n\n\n\n## Summary[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nFenway Park\n![](image)\nDodger Stadium\n\n*Boston won the series, 4–1.*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Red Sox entered the postseason as the top seed in the American League, and defeated the Yankees in four games in the Division Series.[14] Next, they defeated the defending champion Houston Astros in five games in the League Championship Series.[15] Including their 2004 win that ended the Curse of the Bambino, this was the fourth World Series appearance by the Red Sox in 15 years and their 13th appearance all-time.\n\n\n\n### Los Angeles Dodgers[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2018 Los Angeles Dodgers season\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe **2018 World Series** was the championship series of Major League Baseball's 2018 season. The 114th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff played between the American League (AL) champion Boston Red Sox and the National League (NL) champion Los Angeles Dodgers. The Red Sox defeated the Dodgers in five games to win their fourth World Series title in 15 years dating back to 2004, and their ninth in franchise history. This was the second World Series matchup between the two franchises, after the Red Sox defeated the Brooklyn Robins (later known as the Dodgers) in five games in 1916.

It was the first World Series in which the Houston Astros had home-field advantage. The series was played in a 2–3–2 format, with the Astros hosting Games 1, 2, 6, and 7; and the Nationals hosting Games 3, 4, and 5.\n\n\nFor the first time in any of the major North American sports leagues, the visiting team won all the games of a seven-game championship series,[6] surpassing the previous high of five.[7] The road team outscored the home team 49–14 in the seven games played.
