Foundation stock in America continued to be imported from Japan until 1974, when the AKC cut off registration to any further Japanese imports until 1992, when it recognized the Japan Kennel Club standards.

Although not the origin of the breed, this area is credited with the breeding which led to the original Pomeranian type of dog. Proper documentation was lacking until the breed's introduction into the United Kingdom.[25]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nToy dogs\n |\n| --- |\n| * Affenpinscher\n* Australian Silky Terrier\n* Bichon Frisé\n* Biewer Terrier\n* Bolognese dog\n* Bolonka\n* Boston Terrier\n* Cavalier King Charles Spaniel\n* Chihuahua\n* Chinese Crested Dog\n* Coton de Tulear\n* English Toy Terrier (Black & Tan)\n* French Bulldog\n* Griffon Bruxellois\n* Havanese dog\n* Italian Greyhound\n* Japanese Chin\n* King Charles Spaniel\n* Lhasa Apso\n* Löwchen\n* Maltese dog\n* Miniature Pinscher\n* Miniature Poodle\n* Papillon dog\n* Pekingese\n* Phalène\n* Pomeranian dog\n* Pug\n* Russkiy Toy\n* Shih Tzu\n* Tibetan Spaniel\n* Toy Fox Terrier\n* Toy Manchester Terrier\n* Toy Poodle\n* Yorkshire Terrier\n |\n| **Types:** Bichon\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe first breed club was set up in England in 1891, and the first breed standard was written shortly afterwards.[30] The first member of the breed was registered in the United States to the American Kennel Club in 1898, and it was recognized in 1900.[25]\n\n\nIn 1912, two Pomeranians were among only three dogs to survive the sinking of RMS *Titanic*.
