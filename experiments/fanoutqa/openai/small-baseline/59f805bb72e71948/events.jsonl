Emerging around 1150 as a corporation associated with the cathedral school of Notre Dame de Paris, it was considered the second-oldest university in Europe.[1]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFour colleges appeared in the 12th century; they became more numerous in the 13th, including Collège d'Harcourt (1280) and the Collège de Sorbonne (1257). Thus the University of Paris assumed its basic form. It was composed of seven groups, the four nations of the faculty of arts, and the three superior faculties of theology, law, and medicine. Men who had studied at Paris became an increasing presence in the high ranks of the Church hierarchy; eventually, students at the University of Paris saw it as a right that they would be eligible to benefices. Church officials such as St. Louis and Clement IV lavishly praised the university.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe faculty and nation system of the University of Paris (along with that of the University of Bologna) became the model for all later medieval universities. Under the governance of the Church, students wore robes and shaved the tops of their heads in tonsure, to signify they were under the protection of the church. Students followed the rules and laws of the Church and were not subject to the king's laws or courts. This presented problems for the city of Paris, as students ran wild, and its official had to appeal to Church courts for justice. Students were often very young, entering the school at 13 or 14 years of age and staying for six to 12 years.\n\n\n\n### 12th century: Organisation[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe three schools: Notre-Dame, Sainte-Geneviève, and Saint-Victor, may be regarded as the triple cradle of the *Universitas scholarium*, which included masters and students; hence the name *University*. Henry Denifle and some others hold that this honour is exclusive to the school of Notre-Dame (Chartularium Universitatis Parisiensis), but the reasons do not seem convincing. He excludes Saint-Victor because, at the request of the abbot and the religious of Saint-Victor, Gregory IX in 1237 authorized them to resume the interrupted teaching of theology. But the university was largely founded about 1208, as is shown by a Bull of Innocent III. Consequently, the schools of Saint-Victor might well have contributed to its formation. Secondly, Denifle excludes the schools of Ste-Geneviève because there had been no interruption in the teaching of the liberal arts. This is debatable and through the period, theology was taught. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Verger, Jacques: *Histoire des Universités en France* (History of French Universities), Toulouse: Editions Privat, 1986\n* Traver, Andrew G.

The earliest historical reference to it is found in Matthew Paris' reference to the studies of his own teacher (an abbot of St. Albans) and his acceptance into \"the fellowship of the elect Masters\" there in about 1170,[4] and it is known that Lotario dei Conti di Segni, the future Pope Innocent III, completed his studies there in 1182 at the age of 21.\n\n\nThe corporation was formally recognised as an \"*Universitas*\" in an edict by King Philippe-Auguste in 1200: in it, among other accommodations granted to future students, he allowed the corporation to operate under ecclesiastic law which would be governed by the elders of the Notre-Dame Cathedral school, and assured all those completing courses there that they would be granted a diploma.[5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe German College, *Collegium alemanicum* is mentioned as early as 1345, the Scots college or *Collegium scoticum* was founded in 1325.

Emerging around 1150 as a corporation associated with the cathedral school of Notre Dame de Paris, it was considered the second-oldest university in Europe.[1]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFour colleges appeared in the 12th century; they became more numerous in the 13th, including Collège d'Harcourt (1280) and the Collège de Sorbonne (1257). Thus the University of Paris assumed its basic form. It was composed of seven groups, the four nations of the faculty of arts, and the three superior faculties of theology, law, and medicine. Men who had studied at Paris became an increasing presence in the high ranks of the Church hierarchy; eventually, students at the University of Paris saw it as a right that they would be eligible to benefices. Church officials such as St. Louis and Clement IV lavishly praised the university.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe faculty and nation system of the University of Paris (along with that of the University of Bologna) became the model for all later medieval universities. Under the governance of the Church, students wore robes and shaved the tops of their heads in tonsure, to signify they were under the protection of the church. Students followed the rules and laws of the Church and were not subject to the king's laws or courts. This presented problems for the city of Paris, as students ran wild, and its official had to appeal to Church courts for justice. Students were often very young, entering the school at 13 or 14 years of age and staying for six to 12 years.\n\n\n\n### 12th century: Organisation[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe three schools: Notre-Dame, Sainte-Geneviève, and Saint-Victor, may be regarded as the triple cradle of the *Universitas scholarium*, which included masters and students; hence the name *University*. Henry Denifle and some others hold that this honour is exclusive to the school of Notre-Dame (Chartularium Universitatis Parisiensis), but the reasons do not seem convincing. He excludes Saint-Victor because, at the request of the abbot and the religious of Saint-Victor, Gregory IX in 1237 authorized them to resume the interrupted teaching of theology. But the university was largely founded about 1208, as is shown by a Bull of Innocent III. Consequently, the schools of Saint-Victor might well have contributed to its formation. Secondly, Denifle excludes the schools of Ste-Geneviève because there had been no interruption in the teaching of the liberal arts. This is debatable and through the period, theology was taught. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Verger, Jacques: *Histoire des Universités en France* (History of French Universities), Toulouse: Editions Privat, 1986\n* Traver, Andrew G.

They were later reestablished in the 1940s as part of the Pontifical University of Salamanca.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Related affairs[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nCompostela Group of Universities\n |\n| --- |\n| Members | * Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznań\n* Centro de Enseñanza Técnica y Superior\n* Columbus University\n* ESAN University\n* Grigol Robakidze University\n* Ilia State University\n* Jaume I University\n* Karlstad University\n* Kazimieras Simonavičius University\n* King Juan Carlos University\n* Kore University of Enna\n* Masaryk University\n* Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education\n* Federico Villarreal National University\n* National University of San Marcos\n* Pan-European University\n* Peruvian University of Applied Sciences\n* Philipps University of Marburg\n* Pontifical Catholic University of Peru\n* São Paulo State University\n* Santo Domingo Institute of Technology\n* Technical University of Madrid\n* Universidad Anáhuac Xalapa (Anahuac University Network)\n* Universidad La Salle México\n* Universidad Politécnica de Cartagena\n* Università telematica internazionale Uninettuno\n* University Business Academy in Novi Sad\n* University of A Coruña\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe faculty renovated the theology department, laid the foundation for modern-day law, international law, modern economic science and actively participated in the Council of Trent. The school's mathematicians studied the calendar reform, commissioned by Pope Gregory XIII and proposed the solution that was later implemented. By 1580, 6,500 new students had arrived at Salamanca each year, amongst the graduates were state officials of the Spanish monarchy administration. It was also during this period when the first female university students were probably admitted, Beatriz Galindo and Luisa de Medrano, the latter probably being the first woman ever to give classes at a university.[13]\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n### Sorcery[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPrior to the foundation of the university, Salamanca was home to a cathedral school, known to have been in existence by 1130. The university was founded as a *studium generale* by the Leonese king Alfonso IX in 1218 as the *scholas Salamanticae*, with the actual creation of the university (or the transformation of the existing school into the university) occurring between August 1218 and the following winter.[1] A further royal charter from King Alfonso X, dated 8 May 1254, established rules for the organisation and financial endowment of the university, and referred to it for the first time by that name.[10] A papal bull of Alexander IV in 1255 confirmed the Royal Charter of Alfonso X and granted universal recognition to the university's degrees.[11]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Private | * Camilo José Cela\n* Universidad Isabel I\n* European University of the Atlantic\n* European University of Madrid\n* Francisco de Vitoria\n* IE University\n* International University of La Rioja\n* Miguel de Cervantes European University\n* Mondragon\n* Ramon Llull\n* Valencian International University\n* Vic\n* Canary Islands\n |\n| Catholic | * Abat Oliba CEU\n* Catholic University of Ávila\n* CEU Cardenal Herrera\n* CEU San Pablo\n* Comillas\n* Deusto\n* Loyola Andalucía\n* Navarra\n* Pontifical University of Salamanca\n* San Antonio\n* San Vicente Mártir\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Álvarez Villar, Julián (1972). *La Universidad de Salamanca: arte y tradiciones*. p. 13.

It is one of only two Hispanophone universities in the world that have a MoU with the United Nations to train language professionals for the organization.[22] In conjunction with the University of Cambridge, the University of Salamanca co-founded the Association of Language Testers in Europe (ALTE) in 1989.\n\n\nIn 2018, the institution celebrated its eighth centennial.[23]\n\n\n\n## Library[edit]\n\n\nThe library holds about 906,000 volumes.[24]\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn popular belief, the university was associated with sorcery.

Even within Russell Group institutions, it is remarkable how consistently Oxford and Cambridge appear to require more effort of their students than other universities.

In 2018–2019, for instance, 18.8% of applicants were admitted.[108][109] In 2021, Cambridge introduced an over-subscription clause to its offers of admission, which also permits the university to withdraw acceptances if too many students meet its selective entrance criteria. The clause can be invoked in the event of circumstances outside the reasonable control of the university. The clause was introduced following a record number of A-level pupils obtained the highest grades from teacher assessment, which was introduced due to the cancellation of A-level examinations during the COVID-19 pandemic.[110][111]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_xoShzG1D3MprhTYV4ln7l1v9","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
