Some express excitement about the opportunity to share their own statistics, while others find the data embarrassing.[20]\n\n\n\n### On social media[edit]\n\n\nIn 2018, Spotify's customer support account on Twitter received a large number of messages from people complaining about their Spotify Wrapped results, believing them to be wrong or unfair.[5]\n\n\nIn December 2019, more than 1,200,000 posts on Twitter were about Spotify Wrapped after it came out near the beginning of the month.[1][4]\n\n\n\n### In media[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn response to the success of Spotify's Wrapped campaign, several competing music streaming services have introduced similar data compilation features. Apple Music released its \"Replay\" playlist feature in 2019, accessible throughout the year, then redesigned \"Replay\" in 2022 to incorporate more interactive elements akin to Wrapped.[28][29] Tidal launched its \"My Rewind\" feature in 2020, which is available on the 1st of December every year alongside a curated \"Best of\" series.[30] YouTube Music started rolling out the \"Your Music Journey\" email and playlist feature in 2020, before releasing the Recap feature in 2021; in 2022 a seasonal recap feature was introduced.[31] Deezer's \"#MyDeezerYear\" feature was introduced in 2021.[32]\n\n\n\n### By the marketing industry[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Braun, T.
