Kishimoto wanted each member to have a high level of aptitude in one skill and be talentless in another.[12] He found it difficult to write about romance, but emphasized it more in Part II of the manga, beginning with volume 28.[8] He introduced villains into the story to have them act as a counterpoint to his characters' moral values and clearly illustrate their differences.[13] As a result of how the younger characters were significantly weaker than the villains, Kishimoto made the ellipsis in order to have them age and become stronger during this time.[14]\n\n\n\n### Setting[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nCards for each set are available in collectible tins, containing several booster packs and exclusive promotional cards in a metal box.[109] By October 2006, seventeen series had been released in Japan with 417 unique cards.[106] As of August 2008, ten of these series had been released in North America.[110]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Manga[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n*Naruto* won the 16th Spanish Manga Barcelona award for the shonen category in 2010.[111] The manga won the Quill Award for graphic novel in 2006.[112][113] It was nominated for Favorite Manga Series in *Nickelodeon Magazine*'s 2009 Comics Awards.[114] In 2015, it was nominated for the 19th Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize.[115] Masashi Kishimoto was the winner of Rookie of the Year for the series in the Japanese government's Agency for Cultural Affairs 2014 Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology Fine Arts Recommendation Awards.[116] On TV Asahi's Manga S\u014dsenkyo 2021 poll, in which 150,000 people voted for their top 100 manga series, *Naruto* ranked seventh.[117]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n39. **^** Media, Viz (2007). *Fall 2007 Naruto Box Set, Volumes 1\u201327 (Naruto)*.
