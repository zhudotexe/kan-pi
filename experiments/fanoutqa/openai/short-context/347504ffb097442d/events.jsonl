They finished the shortened regular season with a 40–20 (.667) record, the best in the American League. They then swept the Toronto Blue Jays in two games in the Wild Card Series, defeated the New York Yankees in five games in the Division Series, and defeated the Houston Astros in seven games after leading 3–0 in the American League Championship Series (ALCS).[13][14] Randy Arozarena hit seven home runs in 14 postseason games prior to the World Series, becoming the first rookie position player to ever win the ALCS Most Valuable Player Award. After his performance in the World Series, Arozarena would break records in home runs, hits, and total bases in a single postseason.[15][16]\n\n\n\n### Los Angeles Dodgers[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2020 Los Angeles Dodgers season\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"World Series umpires announced\". *MLB.com* (Press release).

Los Angeles and Tampa Bay alternated victories during the first four games of the series before the Dodgers won both Game 5 and 6, becoming the first designated home team to win the World Series since the 2013 edition. Los Angeles shortstop Corey Seager was named the World Series Most Valuable Player (MVP) after batting 8-for-20 (.400) with two home runs, five runs batted in, and an on-base percentage of .556.[4]\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2020 Major League Baseball postseason\n\n### Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2020 Major League Baseball season § Schedule\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| World Series | * 1996\n* 1998\n* 2000\n* 2001\n* 2002\n* 2003\n* 2004\n* 2005\n* 2006\n* 2007\n* 2008\n* 2009\n* 2010\n* 2011\n* 2012\n* 2013\n* 2014\n* 2015\n* 2016\n* 2017\n* 2018\n* 2019\n* 2020\n* 2021\n* 2022\n* 2022\n* 2023\n* 2024\n* 2025\n* 2026\n* 2027\n* 2028\n |\n| AL Championship Series | * 1997\n* 1999\n* 2001\n* 2002\n* 2003\n* 2004\n* 2005\n* 2006\n* 2007\n* 2009\n* 2011\n* 2013\n* 2015\n* 2017\n* 2019\n* 2021\n* 2023\n |\n| NL Championship Series | * 1996\n* 1998\n* 2000\n* 2001\n* 2002\n* 2003\n* 2004\n* 2005\n* 2006\n* 2008\n* 2010\n* 2012\n* 2014\n* 2016\n* 2018\n* 2020\n* 2022\n |\n| AL Division Series | * 1996\n* 1997\n* 1998\n* 1999\n* 2000\n* 2001\n* 2002\n* 2003\n* 2004\n* 2005\n* 2006\n* 2015\n* 2017\n* 2019\n* 2021\n* 2023\n |\n| NL Division Series | * 1996\n* 1998\n* 2000\n* 2001\n* 2002\n* 2003\n* 2004\n* 2005\n* 2006\n* 2014\n* 2016\n* 2018\n* 2020\n* 2022\n |\n| All-Star Game | * 1997\n* 1999\n* 2001\n* 2002\n* 2003\n* 2004\n* 2005\n* 2006\n* 2007\n* 2008\n* 2009\n* 2010\n* 2011\n* 2012\n* 2013\n* 2014\n* 2015\n* 2016\n* 2017\n* 2018\n* 2019\n* ~~2020~~\n* 2021\n* 2022\n* 2023\n* 2024\n* 2025\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Dodgers swept both the Milwaukee Brewers in the Wild Card Series and the San Diego Padres in the Division Series, before defeating the Atlanta Braves in seven games in the National League Championship Series (NLCS) after trailing 3–1 in that series.[20] In the NLCS, Betts made three straight series saving defensive gems in elimination games for the Dodgers as they were the fourteenth team in MLB history to come back from a 3–1 series deficit.[19]\n\n\n\n### Series notes[edit]\n\n\nThe 2020 season rule change, calling for each extra half-inning to begin with a runner on second base, was not implemented for any postseason round, including the World Series.[21]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n91. **^** Scully, Vin [@TheVinScully] (October 28, 2020). \"'55, '59, '63, '65, '81, '88, and now 2020.
