In New York City, for example, a joint committee of the American Red Cross and Charity Organization Society formed to disburse financial aid to survivors and dependents of those who died.[198] On 29 April, opera stars Enrico Caruso and Mary Garden and members of the Metropolitan Opera raised $12,000 ($300,000 in 2014)[199] in benefits for victims of the disaster by giving special concerts in which versions of \"Autumn\" and \"Nearer My God To Thee\" were part of the programme.[200] In Britain, relief funds were organised for the families of *Titanic*'s lost crew members, raising nearly \u00a3450,000 (\u00a356,000,000 today). One such fund was still in operation as late as the 1960s.[201]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Assonitis fired his predecessor. The production was fraught with difficulties arising from Assonitis' exerting an unusual amount of creative control, hiring an Italian crew that didn't speak English and preventing Cameron from viewing any footage during the editing process. The exact degree of creative control Cameron had has been disputed by multiple sources, with some claims arising that Assonitis fired Cameron after two weeks and directed the film on his own while others maintain that Cameron was present for the entirety of principal photography.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter its release, Cameron largely disowned *Piranha II* for many years,[3] but has since acknowledged the film as his directorial debut.[4] A director's cut exists only on Laserdisc and VHS from Embassy Home Entertainment.[5] In 2003, Columbia TriStar Home Entertainment released the film on Region A DVD in a full-frame format. In other regions, the DVD was released in a widescreen format. In 2018, Scream Factory released the film on Region A Blu-ray in an improved widescreen transfer. It received negative reviews upon release and was a box office bomb, but has enjoyed later success as a cult film by fans of James Cameron.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

With few projects in development, Gordon looked at sequels to Fox's existing properties and came across the *Alien\u00a0II* treatment; he said he was surprised that no one had pursued it.[25] Production of *The Terminator* was delayed for nine months because Arnold Schwarzenegger was contractually obligated to film *Conan the Destroyer* (1984). Cameron used the time to develop his treatment, expanding it to ninety pages.[24][29] He drew ideas from \"Mother\", one of his story concepts about an alien on a space station involving a power-loader suit.[31] Because of his low expectations for *The Terminator*, Cameron had spent much of his free time during its production developing and trying out ideas for *Alien\u00a0II*.[28][29]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Industry insiders said that the release delay was because nervous executives ordered the film's ending completely re-shot. There was also the question of the size of the film's budget: 20th Century Fox stated that the budget was $43 million,[10] a figure Cameron himself has reiterated.[23] However, estimates put the figure higher with *The New York Times* estimating the cost at $45 million[24] and one executive claiming it cost $47 million,[25][26] while box office revenue tracker website *The Numbers* lists the production budget at $70 million.[27]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nShortly after the film's premiere, Cameron and video editor Ed Marsh created a longer video cut of *The Abyss* for their own use that incorporated dailies.

According to industry professionals, Schwarzenegger became the top international star ahead of actors such as Mel Gibson and Tom Cruise.[111] It also marked the start of a lasting friendship between Schwarzenegger and Cameron, who formed a \"midlife crisis motorcycle club\" and reunited for the action film *True Lies* (1994).[4] Cameron and Hamilton began a romantic relationship in 1991, married in 1997, and later divorced.[18][162] In 1992 Cameron was given a five-year, $500\u00a0million contract by 20th Century Fox to produce twelve films.[163][164]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe minimum estimated cost to produce *Terminator 2* had been $60\u00a0million, dwarfing the budget of the first film.[4][26][77] Cameron and Schwarzenegger said the final budget, excluding marketing, was about $70\u00a0million, and the cost of making the film was about $51\u00a0million.[77][85] According to Carolco executives Peter Hoffman and Roger Smith, the film cost $75\u00a0million before marketing, saying *Terminator 2* was only \"modestly\" over budget. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Feature | * *Piranha II: The Spawning* (1982)\n* *The Terminator* (1984)\n* *Aliens* (1986)\n* *The Abyss* (1989)\n* *Terminator 2: Judgment Day* (1991)\n* *True Lies* (1994)\n* *Titanic* (1997)\n* *Avatar* (2009)\n* *Avatar: The Way of Water* (2022)\n* *Avatar 3* (2025)\n* *Avatar 4* (2029)\n |\n| Short | * *Xenogenesis* (1978)\n* *T2-3D: Battle Across Time* (1996)\n |\n| Documentaries | * *Expedition: Bismarck* (2002)\n* *Ghosts of the Abyss* (2003)\n* *Aliens of the Deep* (2005)\n |\n\n |\n| Films written | * *Rambo: First Blood Part II* (1985)\n* *Strange Days* (1995)\n* *Alita: Battle Angel* (2019, also produced)\n* *Terminator: Dark Fate* (2019, also produced)\n |\n| Produced only | * *Solaris* (2002)\n |\n| TV series produced | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Series | * *Dark Angel* (2000\u201302)\n* *True Lies* (2023)\n |\n| Documentaries | * *Years of Living Dangerously* (2014)\n* *Secrets of the Whales* (2021)\n* *Secrets of the Octopus* (2024)\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

He felt a love story interspersed with the human loss would be essential to convey the emotional impact of the disaster. Production began on September 1, 1995,[15] when Cameron shot footage of the *Titanic* wreck. The modern scenes on the research vesselwere shot on board the *Akademik Mstislav Keldysh*, which Cameron had used as a base when filming the wreck. Scale models, computer-generated imagery and a reconstruction of the *Titanic* built at Baja Studios were used to recreate the sinking. The film was co-financed by Paramount Pictures and 20th Century Fox; Paramount handled distribution in the United States and Canada while 20th Century Fox released the film internationally. *Titanic* was the most expensive film ever made at the time, with a production budget of $200\u00a0million. Filming took place from July 1996 to March 1997.\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Eglee (under the pseudonym H. A. Milton). The film stars Tricia O'Neil and Lance Henriksen, who would both later appear in Cameron's productions (Henriksen starred in *The Terminator* and *Aliens*; O'Neil had a small role in *Titanic*). It is the second installment in the *Piranha* film series and the sequel to *Piranha* (1978).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter its release, Cameron largely disowned *Piranha II* for many years,[3] but has since acknowledged the film as his directorial debut.[4] A director's cut exists only on Laserdisc and VHS from Embassy Home Entertainment.[5] In 2003, Columbia TriStar Home Entertainment released the film on Region A DVD in a full-frame format. In other regions, the DVD was released in a widescreen format. In 2018, Scream Factory released the film on Region A Blu-ray in an improved widescreen transfer. It received negative reviews upon release and was a box office bomb, but has enjoyed later success as a cult film by fans of James Cameron.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSome critics called the film \"abject\",[10] others opined that \"the piranhas...look as though they had been remaindered from a joke shop\" and that they resembled \"haddock with dentures\".[11] According to Tim Healey in *The World's Worst Movies* (1986) the film is \"a strong contender ... for anyone's list of all-time horror turkeys\".[11] The film holds a 5% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 20 reviews.[12] It was a box-office bomb.[13][14] On Metacritic, the film has a 15/100 based on 5 reviews, meaning \"overwhelming dislike\".[15]\n\n\nJames Cameron refers to *The Terminator* as his first feature-length film, despite the fact that it was made in 1984, two years after *Piranha II: The Spawning*.[3] However, Cameron acknowledged the film in a *60 Minutes* segment with interviewer Morley Safer in 2010, referring to *Piranha II* as \"the best flying piranha film ever made\".[4]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Visto censura 78048\" (PDF) (in Italian). www.italiataglia.it.

On the *Terminator 2: Judgment Day* commentary track, Cameron jokingly defended the film, tongue firmly in cheek, as \"the finest flying killer fish horror/comedy ever made\". He would later employ some of the same mechanisms used to make the piranhas fly in the facehugger animatronics for *Aliens*.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Post-production[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n\"I pitched this idea of bringing Kevin McCarthy back, all chewed up and mutilated from the previous movie,\" says Drake. \"He was on an abandoned oil rig and he was developing these flying piranhas out there to get revenge, or whatever. I think we were going to bring Barbara Steele back and have him kill her by smashing her head through a fish tank.\"\n\n\nPlans changed as neither McCarthy nor Steele were available, and the script was eventually re-written as a standalone story without returning characters. James Cameron, another New World alumnus, was hired as the special effects director. Some time before principal photography started, Miller Drake was fired by Assonitis and Cameron was promoted to director. *Piranha II* would be his feature directorial debut.\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter the release and financial success of Joe Dante's *Piranha*, producers Jeff Schechtman and Chako van Leuwen immediately began work on a sequel film. Roger Corman, the head of New World Pictures which had produced and released the first film, did not share either person's interest, instead focusing on his own \"underwater horror\" film *Humanoids from the Deep*. Schechtman and van Leuwen purchased the sequel rights from Corman, first setting up an independent production company before developing a script with writers Charles H. Eglee and Channing Gibson, based on a treatment by New World producer Martin B. Cohen.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n> \n> I was replaced after two-and-a-half weeks by the Italian producer. He just fired me and took over, which is what he wanted to do when he hired me. It wasn't until much later that I even figured out what had happened. It was like, 'Oh, man, I thought I was doing a good job.' But when I saw what they were cutting together, it was horrible. And then the producer wouldn't take my name off the picture because [contractually] they couldn't deliver it with an Italian name. So they left me on, no matter what I did. I had no legal power to influence him from Pomona, California, where I was sleeping on a friend's couch. I didn't even know an attorney. In actual fact, I did some directing on the film, but I don't feel it was my first movie.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u2014 James Cameron on \"directing\" *Piranha II: The Spawning*.[3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nJames Cameron\n |\n| --- |\n| * Filmography\n* Unrealized projects\n* Awards and nominations\n* Bibliography\n |\n| Films directed | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Feature | * *Piranha II: The Spawning* (1982)\n* *The Terminator* (1984)\n* *Aliens* (1986)\n* *The Abyss* (1989)\n* *Terminator 2: Judgment Day* (1991)\n* *True Lies* (1994)\n* *Titanic* (1997)\n* *Avatar* (2009)\n* *Avatar: The Way of Water* (2022)\n* *Avatar 3* (2025)\n* *Avatar 4* (2029)\n |\n| Short | * *Xenogenesis* (1978)\n* *T2-3D: Battle Across Time* (1996)\n |\n| Documentaries | * *Expedition: Bismarck* (2002)\n* *Ghosts of the Abyss* (2003)\n* *Aliens of the Deep* (2005)\n |\n\n |\n| Films written | * *Rambo: First Blood Part II* (1985)\n* *Strange Days* (1995)\n* *Alita: Battle Angel* (2019, also produced)\n* *Terminator: Dark Fate* (2019, also produced)\n |\n| Produced only | * *Solaris* (2002)\n |\n| TV series produced | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBecause Dante was already attached to direct *The Howling* for New World, the producers approached Dante's former colleague Miller Drake as prospective director. Drake had worked alongside Dante in New World's trailer department and had essayed the role of \"First Mutant\" in Dante's directorial debut, *Hollywood Boulevard*\u00a0\u2013 before becoming Corman's de facto head of post-production. With a tentative director in place, the producers' sought financing and eventually struck a deal with Ovidio G. Assonitis, a Greco-Italian filmmaker who had produced and directed several successful low-budget \"cash-in\" films aimed at the American import market. Drake set to work developing a script with Eglee, who would later collaborate with James Cameron on the TV show *Dark Angel*. Drake's intention was that *Piranha II* should hinge upon Kevin McCarthy's scientist from Piranha, even though he had seemingly perished in the first movie.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Series | * *Dark Angel* (2000\u201302)\n* *True Lies* (2023)\n |\n| Documentaries | * *Years of Living Dangerously* (2014)\n* *Secrets of the Whales* (2021)\n* *Secrets of the Octopus* (2024)\n |\n\n |\n| Related articles | * Lightstorm Entertainment\n* Digital Domain\n* *Deepsea Challenger*\n* *Pristimantis jamescameroni*\n* *The Abyss: Incident at Europa*\n |\n| * ![](image) Category\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nFilms directed by Ovidio G.

Assonitis fired his predecessor. The production was fraught with difficulties arising from Assonitis' exerting an unusual amount of creative control, hiring an Italian crew that didn't speak English and preventing Cameron from viewing any footage during the editing process. The exact degree of creative control Cameron had has been disputed by multiple sources, with some claims arising that Assonitis fired Cameron after two weeks and directed the film on his own while others maintain that Cameron was present for the entirety of principal photography.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe primary location for the film was the Mallards Beach-Hyatt Hotel (later renamed to Moon Palace Jamaica resort), in Ocho Rios, Jamaica, which served as the film's fictional Club Elysium resort.[6] Most of the underwater scenes were filmed off Grand Cayman. Interior scenes were filmed on a sound stage in Rome.[7]\n\n\nDue to budget limitations the crew was composed essentially of Italians, none of whom spoke English. Some however did have prior experience on horror/fantasy movies so they were, to some extent, able to satisfy Cameron's requirements.[*citation needed*] Among the crew was veteran horror cinematographer Roberto D'Ettorre Piazzoli (whose name is misspelled \"Roberto D'Ettore Piazzoli\" in the opening credits). The special effects were designed and supervised by Giannetto De Rossi, who had previously worked on Lucio Fulci's *Zombi 2* and *The Beyond*.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAccording to *Dreaming Aloud*, a biography of Cameron by Christopher Heard, Cameron was not allowed to see his footage and was not involved in editing. He broke into the editing room in Rome and cut his own version while the film's producers were at Cannes, but was caught and Assonitis recut it again.\n\n\nIn a 2008 interview on *The Hour*, Cameron jokingly denied breaking into the editing room, then recounted the story as a \"hypothetical scenario\", and told host George Stroumboulopoulos how he \"would've broken into the office\" if he actually did it.[8]\n\n\nCameron was able to make a deal with a distributor, who agreed to buy his footage and allow him to re-score and re-cut the picture to basically restructure it to what was originally intended before release, so his alternative vision eventually came out on home video in some regions, which made a profit for the distributor.[9]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA Caribbean coastal resort, Hotel Elysium, is menaced by a series of vicious marine animal attacks originating from a nearby sunken shipwreck. Diving instructor Anne Kimbrough's student is one of the victims, but her estranged police officer husband Steve refuses to let her see the corpse despite the fact that, while she knows what didn't cause the death, she doesn't know what did, either. Soon after, two women and a man are killed by piranha which has developed the ability to fly.\n\n\nConcerned, Anne finds that she is being frequently bothered by tourist Tyler Sherman, and decides to take him with her to the morgue to get a look at the body. She reveals that she studied marine biology, which explains why she could tell Steve that it wasn't shark or barracudas responsible earlier. A nurse comes in and kicks them out, unaware that a piranha was hiding in the body. It kills the nurse and escapes through a window.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWhen Chris and Allison are stranded in a raft above the shipwreck, Anne and Tyler arrive in a motorboat and dive down to the wreck to plant the timer charges that Gabby left behind. With only 10 minutes to get out of the wreck before the bomb explodes, Anne and Tyler are trapped in one of the sunken ships rooms by the murderous piranha who all return to the wreck. Steve, piloting a police helicopter, ditches the chopper and swims to Anne and Tyler's motorboat where Chris and Allison are. Steve powers up the boat and takes off. Down in the wreck, Tyler gets stuck and is eaten by the piranhas. Anne escapes out of a porthole, then grabs the anchor, allowing herself to be pulled away by the motorboat on the surface. The bomb detonates, destroying the sunken ship and all the piranha with it. With all the piranhas dead, Anne swims to the surface and is picked up by Steve, Chris, and Allison in their boat.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Fox estimated the cost as close to $35\u00a0million, but Hurd said it would be closer to $15.5\u00a0million. Diller offered $12\u00a0million, prompting Cameron and Hurd to quit. Gordon negotiated with Diller until he relented, and Cameron and Hurd returned.[25] In April 1985, conflict turned to the cast; Fox did not want Weaver to return because they expected her to demand a high salary.[25][32] Cameron and Hurd were insistent Weaver return as the solo star; Fox refused, saying they would damage the studio's negotiating power with Weaver's agent. Cameron and Hurd again left the project, marrying and going on a honeymoon. When they returned, the *Aliens* project was ready to move forward. Cameron credited Gordon with *Aliens*' being greenlit.[25]\n\n\n\n### Casting[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDespite the success of *Alien*, its sequel took years to develop due to lawsuits, a lack of enthusiasm from 20th Century Fox, and repeated management changes. Although relatively inexperienced, Cameron was hired to write a story for *Aliens* in 1983 on the strength of his scripts for *The Terminator* (1984) and *Rambo: First Blood Part II* (1985). The project stalled again until new Fox executive Lawrence Gordon pursued a sequel. On an approximately $18.5\u00a0million budget, *Aliens* began principal photography in September 1985 and concluded in January 1986. Like its development, filming was tumultuous and rife with conflicts between Cameron and the British crew at Pinewood Studios. The difficult shoot affected the composer, James Horner, who was given little time to record the music.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n*Aliens* began a wide release in the United States (U.S.) and Canada on July\u00a018, 1986.[3] During its opening weekend, the film earned $10.1\u00a0million from 1,437 theaters\u2014an average of $6,995 per theater. It was the weekend's number-one film, ahead of the martial-arts drama *The Karate Kid Part II* ($5.6\u00a0million in its fifth weekend) and the black comedy *Ruthless People* ($4.5\u00a0million in its fourth weekend).[103] Based on its opening-five-day total ($13.4\u00a0million), *Aliens* exceeded Fox's expectations and was anticipated to become the summer's top film, surpassing *The Karate Kid Part II*, *Back to School*, and *Top Gun*.[25][102] The *Los Angeles Times* reported long lines to see *Aliens*, even on weekday afternoons.[25]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![A photo of the entrance to Pinewood Studios in England](image)*Aliens* was filmed almost entirely at Pinewood Studios in England (pictured in 2015).\nPrincipal photography began in September 1985, on a 75-day schedule, and an $18.5\u00a0million budget,[c] not including film prints and marketing.[25][28][51] Filming took place mainly at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire near London, because of its large sets and the relatively lower cost of filming in England.[d] Filming was tumultuous as Cameron, a Canadian, was unfamiliar with British film-industry traditions such as tea breaks, which interrupted production for up to an hour each weekday, and was frustrated at losing hours of filming every week.[24][32][40] In his book *The Making of Aliens*, J. W. Rinzler described Cameron as aggressive and certain of what he wanted, which irked the crew. The situation was exacerbated by Cameron's hands-on approach, often modifying setups such as lighting himself to fit his vision without involving the unionized crew.[32]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n*Aliens* was released on July 18, 1986, to critical acclaim. Reviewers praised its action, but some criticized the intensity of some scenes. Weaver's performance garnered consistent praise along with those of Bill Paxton and Jenette Goldstein. The film received several awards and nominations, including an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress for Weaver at a time when the science-fiction genre was generally overlooked. It earned $131.1\u2013183.3\u00a0million during its theatrical run, making it one of the highest-grossing films of 1986 worldwide.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n***Aliens*** is a 1986 science fiction action film written and directed by James Cameron. It is the sequel to the 1979 science fiction horror film *Alien*, and the second film in the *Alien* franchise. Set in the far future, it stars Sigourney Weaver as Ellen Ripley, the sole survivor of an alien attack on her ship. When communications are lost with a human colony on the moon where her crew first saw the alien creatures, Ripley agrees to return to the site with a unit of Colonial Marines to investigate. Michael Biehn, Paul Reiser, Lance Henriksen, and Carrie Henn are featured in supporting roles.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPost-production began in late April 1986.[25] Several scenes were removed from *Aliens*' theatrical release, including Ripley learning about her daughter's death and a cocooned Burke begging her for death.[13] Fox and Hurd suggested removing a long opening scene detailing the lives of the colonists, Newt's family discovering the derelict alien ship, and her father being attacked by a facehugger, because it ruined the pacing and sense of mystery.[31][62] Two scenes with James Remar as Hicks (shown from the back) were used in the film.[4]\n\n\nRay Lovejoy was responsible for editing the final two hours, 17 minutes cut of *Aliens*.[63] Fox wanted the film to be under two hours so it could be shown more times per day in theaters, increasing its revenue potential. Fox production president Scott Rudin flew to England to ask Cameron and Hurd if they could cut another 12 minutes, but Cameron was concerned further cuts would make it nonsensical, and Rudin relented.[25][63]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n85. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** Freer, Ian (July 23, 2016). \"11 Ways James Cameron's *Aliens* Changed The Movies\". *The Daily Telegraph*.

Effects Group created miniatures and optical effects. Cameron lacked contacts at the more established special effects studios and avoided using them because he believed his hands-on approach would not be welcomed.[73] He also did not rehire many *Alien* crew members because he did not want to be restricted by their loyalties to the first film. Those who returned were often given a higher status (such as Crispian Sallis, *Alien* focus puller and *Aliens* set decorator).[52][74] Cameron had enjoyed returning artist Ron Cobb's work on *Alien*,[75] and conceptual artist Syd Mead was recruited because Cameron was a fan of his work on films such as *2010: The Year We Make Contact* (1984).[53]\n\n\n\n### Sets and technology[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHis credibility was elevated following the surprise financial and critical success of *The Terminator* in late 1984, and Gordon gave him the job.[25][29][32] Cameron's associates tried to persuade him to reject the offer, believing anything good about the film would be attributed to *Alien* director Ridley Scott and anything negative to Cameron.[33] Scott said he was never offered the chance to direct the sequel, possibly because he was difficult to work with on the original.[34] The title *Aliens* reportedly came from Cameron writing \"Alien\" on a whiteboard during a pitch meeting and adding a \"$\" suffix.[35][36] Cameron also wanted his collaborative partner and girlfriend, Gale Anne Hurd, to serve as the producer, but Fox did not take the request seriously, believing she could not stand up to Cameron, who believed she was the only person who would.[31][32] Hurd had several industry associates contact Fox executives to convince them she was a legitimate producer.[32]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n42. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Egnash, Martin (September 25, 2018). \"Al Matthews, Marine Veteran Who Played Apone In *Aliens*, Dies at 75\". *Military.com*.

Jamie Lee Curtis, Tom Arnold, Bill Paxton, Art Malik, and Tia Carrere star in supporting roles. *True Lies* was the first Lightstorm Entertainment project to be distributed under Cameron's multimillion-dollar production deal with 20th Century Fox, as well as the first major production for the visual effects company Digital Domain, which was co-founded by Cameron. It was also the first film to cost $100 million.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n1994 American action comedy film by James Cameron\n\nThis article is about the film. For other uses, see True Lies (disambiguation).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger stated that while filming a scene with a horse, a camera boom hit the horse and \"it went crazy, spinning and rearing\" near a drop of 90 feet (27\u00a0m). Schwarzenegger quickly slid off the horse and a stuntman caught him; he concluded, \"[this is] why I will always love stunt people\".[7] Art Malik said he was drawn to the script's \"pantomime quality\u201d and the chance to work with director James Cameron.[8] Costing $100[2][3]\u2013120[4][9] million to produce, *True Lies* was the first film with a production budget of over $100 million.[10] It was filmed over a seven-month schedule.[4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n*True Lies* received mostly positive reviews from critics, and ultimately grossed $378 million worldwide at the box office, becoming the third-highest-grossing film of 1994.[6] For her performance, Curtis won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy and the Saturn Award for Best Actress, while Cameron won the Saturn Award for Best Director. It was also nominated at the Academy Awards and BAFTAs in the Best Visual Effects category, and also for seven Saturn Awards.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n*True Lies* was a box-office success. Opening in 2,368 theaters in the United States and Canada, it ranked number one at the US box office in its opening weekend, grossing $25,869,770 and beating *Forrest Gump*.[2] Once *Forrest Gump* returned to the top of the box office the following week, *True Lies* dropped into second place, earning $20.7 million.[20] It was the number one film in Japan for twelve straight weeks.[21] *True Lies* was the second major American film to be released in China since *The Fugitive* and generated a total of CN\u00a5103 million, becoming the country's highest-grossing Hollywood film.[22][23] The film also became the highest-grossing film of all time in the Philippines.[24] *True Lies* went on to gross $146,282,411 in the United States and Canada and $232,600,000 in the rest of world, totaling $378,882,411 worldwide,[5] making it the third-highest-grossing film of 1994, behind *The Lion King* and *Forrest Gump*.[6][25]\n\n\n\n### Critical reception[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn April 1997, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Tom Arnold met with Cameron and discussed the possibility of an eventual *True Lies* sequel, which would also bring back Curtis in her role. At the time, Cameron was busy working on *Titanic*.[60][61] Following the release of *Titanic* in late 1997, Cameron was planning to begin work on a *True Lies* sequel early the following year. Schwarzenegger and Arnold were expected to reprise their roles.[62] Cameron conducted a search for a writer to work on *True Lies 2*. In August 1999, Cameron and 20th Century Fox were negotiating to have Jeff Eastin write the script under Cameron's supervision.[61] At the time, the film was being planned for a mid-2001 release, with Cameron expected to direct it.[63] By the end of 1999, there was the possibility that filming would begin in the third quarter of 2000.[64] However, development of the script was ongoing as of June 2000. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n23. **^** Papish, Jonathan (February 8, 2017). \"China's All-time Highest Grossing Imports\". *China Film Insider*.

We have a good script. There does need to be some changes because it deals with some terrorist act of some sort. But it's pretty much done.\"[72] Later in 2002, Cameron said the film would not be made following the September 11 attacks: \"Terrorism is no longer something to take as lightly as we did in the first one.

Cameron stated that the nine minutes of added scenes cost more than $1 million a minute to produce and finish.[168] During its 12-week re-release, *Avatar: Special Edition* grossed an additional $10.74 million in North America and $22.46 million overseas for a worldwide total of $33.2 million.[5] The film was later re-released in China in March 2021, allowing it to surpass *Avengers: Endgame* to become the highest-grossing film of all time.[24]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n288. **^** Engber, Daniel (August 22, 2009). \"Avatar = \"Apocalypto\" + George Lucas\". *Slate*.

He decided to concentrate on making documentaries and refining the technology for the next few years. It was revealed in a *Bloomberg BusinessWeek* cover story that 20th Century Fox had fronted $10\u00a0million to Cameron to film a proof-of-concept clip for *Avatar*, which he showed to Fox executives in October 2005.[49]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIncluding the revenue from a re-release of *Avatar* featuring extended footage, *Avatar* grossed $785,221,649 in the U.S. and Canada, and $2,137,696,265 in other countries for a worldwide total of $2,922,917,914.[5] *Avatar* has set a number of box office records during its release: on January 25, 2010, it surpassed *Titanic*'s worldwide gross to become the highest-grossing film of all time worldwide 41 days after its international release,[264][265][266] just two days after taking the foreign box office record.[267] On February 2, 47 days after its domestic release, *Avatar* surpassed *Titanic* to become the highest-grossing film of all time in Canada and the United States.[268] It became the highest-grossing film of all time in at least 30 other countries[269][270][271][272][273][274] and is the first film to gross over $2\u00a0billion in foreign box office receipts.[275]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIt was a tougher sell\u00a0...\"[299] *The Hollywood Reporter* estimated that after a combined production and promotion cost of between $387 million and $437 million, the film turned a net profit of $1.2 billion.[301]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Accolades[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of accolades received by *Avatar*\n\n*Avatar* won the 82nd Academy Awards for Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, and Best Visual Effects, and was nominated for a total of nine, including Best Picture and Best Director.[302] *Avatar* also won the 67th Golden Globe Awards for Best Motion Picture\u00a0\u2013 Drama and Best Director, and was nominated for two others.[303] At the 36th Saturn Awards, *Avatar* won all ten awards it was nominated for: Best Science Fiction Film, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actor, Best Supporting Actress, Best Director, Best Writing, Best Music, Best Production Design and Best Special Effects.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n*Avatar* premiered on December 10, 2009, in London and was released in the United States on December 18, 2009, to positive reviews. Critics highly praised its groundbreaking visual effects, though the story was considered to be predictable.[21][22][23] During its theatrical run, the film broke several box office records, including becoming the highest-grossing film of all time. In July 2019, this position was overtaken by *Avengers: Endgame*, but with subsequent re-releases, beginning with China in March 2021, it returned to becoming the highest-grossing film since then.[24] Adjusted for inflation, *Avatar* is the second-highest-grossing movie of all time, only behind *Gone with the Wind*, with a total of a little more than $3.5 billion. It also became the first film to gross more than $2 billion[25] and the best-selling video title of 2010 in the United States. *Avatar* was nominated for nine awards at the 82nd Academy Awards, winning three, and received numerous other accolades. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n64. **^** Thompson, Anne (January 2010). \"How James Cameron's Innovative New 3D Tech Created *Avatar*\". *Popular Mechanics*.

The director indicated that he had already worked four months on nonprincipal scenes for the film.[63] The live action was shot with a modified version of the proprietary digital 3-D Fusion Camera System, developed by Cameron and Vince Pace.[64] In January 2007, Fox had announced that 3-D filming for *Avatar* would be done at 24 frames per second despite Cameron's strong opinion that a 3-D film requires higher frame rate to make strobing less noticeable.[65] According to Cameron, the film is composed of 60% computer-generated elements and 40% live action, as well as traditional miniatures.[66]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n278. **^** Tartaglione, Nancy (October 2, 2022). \"'Smile' Giddy With $37M Global Bow, China Returns At $60M Local 'Home Coming'; Keep A Bag Packed For 'Ticket To Paradise' \u2013 International Box Office\". *Deadline Hollywood*.
