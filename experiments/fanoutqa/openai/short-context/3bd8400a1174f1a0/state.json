Its membership, as set by the Judiciary Act of 1869, consists of the chief justice of the United States and eight associate justices, any six of whom constitute a quorum.[1][2] Article II, Section 2, Clause 2 of the Constitution grants plenary power to the president of the United States to nominate, and with the advice and consent of the United States Senate, appoint justices to the Supreme Court; justices have life tenure.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Supreme Court of the United States\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n14. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Although Lewis Powell and William H. Rehnquist were both sworn into office as associate justice on the same day, Powell by law took precedence as the more senior associate justice, his judicial commission bearing the date Dec.\u00a09, 1971; Rehnquist's commission bore the date of Dec.\u00a016, 1971.\n15. **^** Acted as chief justice under 62 Stat. 869, September 3\u201329, 2005.\n\n## Timeline of justices[edit]\n\n\nThis graphical timeline depicts the progression of the justices on the U.S. Supreme Court.[9][10] Information regarding each justice's predecessors, successors, and fellow justices, as well as their tenure on the court, can be gleaned (and comparisons between justices drawn) from it. There are no formal names or numbers for the individual seats of the associate justices, which are listed in the table below simply by number.

The length of service on the Court for the 107 non-incumbent justices ranges from William O. Douglas's 36\u00a0years, 209\u00a0days to John Rutledge's 1\u00a0year, 18\u00a0days as associate justice and, separated by a period of years off the Court, his 138\u00a0days as chief justice. As of June 13, 2024, the length of service for the nine incumbent justices ranges from Clarence Thomas's 32\u00a0years, 234\u00a0days to Ketanji Brown Jackson's 1\u00a0year, 349\u00a0days. Five individuals, who were confirmed for associate justice, were later appointed chief justice separately: John Rutledge,[a] Edward Douglass White,[b] Charles Evans Hughes,[a] Harlan F. Stone[b] and William Rehnquist.[b] While listed twice, each of them has been assigned only one index number. The justices of the Supreme Court are:[9][10]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Served on the Supreme Court twice: first as associate justice and then, after a period of years off the Court, as chief justice.\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Elevated from associate justice to chief justice while serving on the Supreme Court. Such appointments are subject to a separate confirmation process.\n3. ^ ***a*** ***b*** State of residence at the time of appointment. For example, in 1971, Rehnquist was appointed from Arizona, but in 1986, when elevated to chief justice, he was appointed from Virginia.[10]\n4. **^** The *start date* given for each justice is the day they took the prescribed judicial oath of office, with the *end date* being the date of the justice's death, resignation, or retirement.[10]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n5. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** While Justice Wilson was the first to take the oath of office, \u00a7\u00a01 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 prescribes precedence of the associate justices by the dates their judicial commissions bear. This rule of precedences exists to this day, codified at Title 28, U.S. Code \u00a7\u00a04. The commissions of the first four associate justices bear the following dates: Rutledge, Sept.\u00a026, 1789; Cushing, Sept.\u00a027; Wilson, Sept.\u00a029; and Blair, Sept.\u00a030.\n6. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** ***k*** ***l*** Recess appointment. Note: the date on which the justice took the judicial oath is here used as the date of the beginning of their service, not the date of the recess appointment.\n7. **^** This was the first Supreme Court nomination to be rejected by the Senate. Rutledge remains the only \"recess appointed\" justice not to be subsequently confirmed by the Senate.\n8. **^** Was impeached, but not convicted, and remained in office.\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

The basis of the ranking is the difference between dates; if counted by number of calendar days all the figures would be one greater, with the exception of Charles Evans Hughes and John Rutledge, who would receive two days, as each served on the court twice (their service as associate justice and as chief justice was separated by a period of years off the court).

The first Justice to be appointed who had attended an actual law school was Levi Woodbury, appointed to the Court in 1846. Woodbury had attended Tapping Reeve Law School in Litchfield, Connecticut, the most prestigious law school in the United States in that day, prior to his admission to the bar in 1812. However, Woodbury did not earn a law degree. Woodbury's successor on the Court, Benjamin Robbins Curtis, who received his law degree from Harvard Law School in 1832, and was appointed to the Court in 1851, was the first Justice to bear such a credential.[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* University of Michigan\n\t+ William R.

Yale Law professor George Priest recommended Kavanaugh to Kozinski, who was regarded as a feeder judge.[40] Kavanaugh interviewed for a clerkship with Chief Justice William Rehnquist of the U.S. Supreme Court during the 1992 term, but was not offered a clerkship.[40]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n251. **^** Liptak, Adam; Weiland, Noah (October 9, 2018). \"Justice Kavanaugh Takes the Bench on the Supreme Court\". *The New York Times*.

By this metric, Kavanaugh's confirmation shifted the court to the right.[164] Had Barack Obama's nominee Merrick Garland been confirmed in 2016, Stephen Breyer would have become the median swing vote when Kennedy retired. However, since Antonin Scalia was replaced by another conservative (Gorsuch), it was expected that Chief Justice John Roberts would become the median swing vote on the Supreme Court upon Kavanaugh's confirmation.[165]\n\n\n\n### Senate Judiciary Committee public hearings[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Chief justices\n |\n| --- |\n| 1.

Milford Central School*, argued that a Christian Bible instruction program should have the same after-school access to school facilities as other non-curriculum-related student groups.[61]\n\n\n\n### Federalist Society[edit]\n\n\nKavanaugh has been a member of the Federalist Society since 1988.[62][63] In the administration of George W. Bush, he held a key position that involved judicial appointments.

Jackson Women's Health Organization.*[305][306]\n\n\n\n## Publications[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter graduating from Georgetown Prep in 1983,[34] Kavanaugh went to Yale University, as had his paternal grandfather.[35][36] Several of Kavanaugh's Yale classmates remembered him as a \"serious but not showy student\" who loved sports, especially basketball.[37] He unsuccessfully tried out for the Yale Bulldogs men's basketball team and later played for two years on the junior varsity team.[37] He wrote articles about basketball and other sports for the *Yale Daily News*,[37] and was a member of the fraternity Delta Kappa Epsilon.[38][39] He graduated from Yale in 1987 with a Bachelor of Arts *cum laude* in history.[37]\n\n\nKavanaugh then attended Yale Law School, where he lived in a group house with future judge James E. Boasberg and played basketball with professor George L. Priest (sponsor of the school's Federalist Society).[40] He was a member of the *Yale Law Journal* and served as a notes editor during his third year. Kavanaugh graduated from Yale Law with a Juris Doctor degree in 1990.[41]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nKavanaugh was raised in Bethesda, Maryland. As a teenager, he attended Georgetown Preparatory School, a Jesuit boys' college prep school, where he was two years ahead of Neil Gorsuch, with whom he later clerked at the Supreme Court and eventually served with as a Supreme Court justice.[27][28] He was captain of the basketball team and was a wide receiver and cornerback on the football team.[29] Kavanaugh was also friends with classmate Mark Judge; both were in the same class with Maryland state senator Richard Madaleno.[30][31][32][33] In his yearbook Kavanaugh called himself a \"Renate Alumnius\", a reference to a female student at a nearby Catholic school.[34]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
