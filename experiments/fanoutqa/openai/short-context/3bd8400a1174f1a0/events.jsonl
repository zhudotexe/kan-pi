Its membership, as set by the Judiciary Act of 1869, consists of the chief justice of the United States and eight associate justices, any six of whom constitute a quorum.[1][2] Article II, Section 2, Clause 2 of the Constitution grants plenary power to the president of the United States to nominate, and with the advice and consent of the United States Senate, appoint justices to the Supreme Court; justices have life tenure.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Supreme Court of the United States\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n14. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Although Lewis Powell and William H. Rehnquist were both sworn into office as associate justice on the same day, Powell by law took precedence as the more senior associate justice, his judicial commission bearing the date Dec. 9, 1971; Rehnquist's commission bore the date of Dec. 16, 1971.\n15. **^** Acted as chief justice under 62 Stat. 869, September 3–29, 2005.\n\n## Timeline of justices[edit]\n\n\nThis graphical timeline depicts the progression of the justices on the U.S. Supreme Court.[9][10] Information regarding each justice's predecessors, successors, and fellow justices, as well as their tenure on the court, can be gleaned (and comparisons between justices drawn) from it. There are no formal names or numbers for the individual seats of the associate justices, which are listed in the table below simply by number. Additionally, the progression of U.S. presidents is shown at the top of the timeline to give a more detailed historical context.\n\n\n\n![](image)\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* **Associate justices:** Clarence Thomas\n* Samuel Alito\n* Sonia Sotomayor\n* Elena Kagan\n* Neil Gorsuch\n* Brett Kavanaugh\n* Amy Coney Barrett\n* Ketanji Brown Jackson\n |\n| Retired justices | * Anthony Kennedy\n* David Souter\n* Stephen Breyer\n |\n| History | * Jay Court (1789–1795)\n* Rutledge Court (1795)\n* Ellsworth Court (1796–1800)\n* Marshall Court (1801–1835)\n* Taney Court (1836–1864)\n* Chase Court (1864–1873)\n* Waite Court (1874–1888)\n* Fuller Court (1888–1910)\n* White Court (1910–1921)\n* Taft Court (1921–1930)\n* Hughes Court (1930–1941)\n* Stone Court (1941–1946)\n* Vinson Court (1946–1953)\n* Warren Court (1953–1969)\n* Burger Court (1969–1986)\n* Rehnquist Court (1986–2005)\n* Roberts Court (2005–present)\n |\n| Lists of justicesand nominees | * Chief justices\n* Associate justices\n* All justices\n\t+ court\n\t+ education\n\t+ seat\n\t+ time in office\n* All nominations\n\t+ unsuccessful\n* Justices who served in Congress\n* Burial places of justices\n |\n| Statutes affectingcourt size | * Judiciary Act of 1789\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nSupreme Court of the United States\n |\n| --- |\n| The court | * Lists of cases\n* Court demographics\n* Ideological leanings\n* Nomination and confirmation\n | ![](image)\n |\n| Procedures | * *Amicus curiae* brief\n* *Certiorari*\n\t+ Cert. before judgment\n\t+ Cert. dismissed as improvidently granted\n\t+ Grant, vacate, remand\n* Shadow docket\n\t+ In-chambers opinion\n |\n| Current members | * **Chief justice:** John Roberts\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| **111** | ![](image) | **Sonia Sotomayor(born 1954)** | **NY** | **AssociateJustice** | **Souter** | **August 6, 2009(68–31)** | **August 8, 2009–Incumbent** | **14 years, 310 days** | Barack Obama |\n| **112** | ![](image) | **Elena Kagan(born 1960)** | **MA** | **AssociateJustice** | **Stevens** | **August 5, 2010(63–37)** | **August 7, 2010–Incumbent** | **13 years, 311 days** |\n| **113** | ![](image) | **Neil Gorsuch(born 1967)** | **CO** | **AssociateJustice** | **Scalia** | **April 7, 2017(54–45)** | **April 10, 2017–Incumbent** | **7 years, 64 days** | Donald Trump |\n| **114** | ![](image) | **Brett Kavanaugh(born 1965)** | **MD** | **AssociateJustice** | **Kennedy** | **October 6, 2018(50–48)** | **October 6, 2018–Incumbent** | **5 years, 251 days** |\n| **115** | ![](image) | **Amy Coney Barrett(born 1972)** | **IN** | **AssociateJustice** | **Ginsburg** | **October 26, 2020(52–48)** | **October 27, 2020–Incumbent** | **3 years, 230 days** |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSince the Supreme Court was established in 1789, 116 people have served on the Court. The length of service on the Court for the 107 non-incumbent justices ranges from William O. Douglas's 36 years, 209 days to John Rutledge's 1 year, 18 days as associate justice and, separated by a period of years off the Court, his 138 days as chief justice. As of June 13, 2024, the length of service for the nine incumbent justices ranges from Clarence Thomas's 32 years, 234 days to Ketanji Brown Jackson's 1 year, 349 days. Five individuals, who were confirmed for associate justice, were later appointed chief justice separately: John Rutledge,[a] Edward Douglass White,[b] Charles Evans Hughes,[a] Harlan F. Stone[b] and William Rehnquist.[b] While listed twice, each of them has been assigned only one index number. The justices of the Supreme Court are:[9][10]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Served on the Supreme Court twice: first as associate justice and then, after a period of years off the Court, as chief justice.\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Elevated from associate justice to chief justice while serving on the Supreme Court. Such appointments are subject to a separate confirmation process.\n3. ^ ***a*** ***b*** State of residence at the time of appointment. For example, in 1971, Rehnquist was appointed from Arizona, but in 1986, when elevated to chief justice, he was appointed from Virginia.[10]\n4. **^** The *start date* given for each justice is the day they took the prescribed judicial oath of office, with the *end date* being the date of the justice's death, resignation, or retirement.[10]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n5. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** While Justice Wilson was the first to take the oath of office, § 1 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 prescribes precedence of the associate justices by the dates their judicial commissions bear. This rule of precedences exists to this day, codified at Title 28, U.S. Code § 4. The commissions of the first four associate justices bear the following dates: Rutledge, Sept. 26, 1789; Cushing, Sept. 27; Wilson, Sept. 29; and Blair, Sept. 30.\n6. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** ***k*** ***l*** Recess appointment. Note: the date on which the justice took the judicial oath is here used as the date of the beginning of their service, not the date of the recess appointment.\n7. **^** This was the first Supreme Court nomination to be rejected by the Senate.

Its membership, as set by the Judiciary Act of 1869, consists of the chief justice of the United States and eight associate justices, any six of whom constitute a quorum.[1][2] Article II, Section 2, Clause 2 of the Constitution grants plenary power to the president of the United States to nominate, and with the advice and consent of the United States Senate, appoint justices to the Supreme Court; justices have life tenure.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Supreme Court of the United States\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Served on the Supreme Court twice: first as associate justice and then, after a period of years off the Court, as chief justice.\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Elevated from associate justice to chief justice while serving on the Supreme Court.

Stone, and Edward Douglass White—their cumulative length of service on the court is measured. The basis of the ranking is the difference between dates; if counted by number of calendar days all the figures would be one greater, with the exception of Charles Evans Hughes and John Rutledge, who would receive two days, as each served on the court twice (their service as associate justice and as chief justice was separated by a period of years off the court). The *start date* given for each justice is the day they took the prescribed oath of office, with the *end date* being the date of the justice's death, resignation, or retirement.

The first Justice to be appointed who had attended an actual law school was Levi Woodbury, appointed to the Court in 1846. Woodbury had attended Tapping Reeve Law School in Litchfield, Connecticut, the most prestigious law school in the United States in that day, prior to his admission to the bar in 1812. However, Woodbury did not earn a law degree. Woodbury's successor on the Court, Benjamin Robbins Curtis, who received his law degree from Harvard Law School in 1832, and was appointed to the Court in 1851, was the first Justice to bear such a credential.[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* University of Michigan\n\t+ William R.

Casey*, in which the Third Circuit upheld many of Pennsylvania's abortion restrictions.[40] Kavanaugh then clerked for Judge Alex Kozinski of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit from 1991 to 1992. Yale Law professor George Priest recommended Kavanaugh to Kozinski, who was regarded as a feeder judge.[40] Kavanaugh interviewed for a clerkship with Chief Justice William Rehnquist of the U.S. Supreme Court during the 1992 term, but was not offered a clerkship.[40]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n251. **^** Liptak, Adam; Weiland, Noah (October 9, 2018). \"Justice Kavanaugh Takes the Bench on the Supreme Court\". *The New York Times*.

He often dined in Cambridge with students and offered references and career advice.[289][290] Kavanaugh received high evaluations from his students, including J.

By this metric, Kavanaugh's confirmation shifted the court to the right.[164] Had Barack Obama's nominee Merrick Garland been confirmed in 2016, Stephen Breyer would have become the median swing vote when Kennedy retired. However, since Antonin Scalia was replaced by another conservative (Gorsuch), it was expected that Chief Justice John Roberts would become the median swing vote on the Supreme Court upon Kavanaugh's confirmation.[165]\n\n\n\n### Senate Judiciary Committee public hearings[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Chief justices\n |\n| --- |\n| 1.

Doe* (2000), argued that a student speaker at football games voted for by a majority of students should be treated as private speech in a limited public forum; the second, in *Good News Club v. Milford Central School*, argued that a Christian Bible instruction program should have the same after-school access to school facilities as other non-curriculum-related student groups.[61]\n\n\n\n### Federalist Society[edit]\n\n\nKavanaugh has been a member of the Federalist Society since 1988.[62][63] In the administration of George W. Bush, he held a key position that involved judicial appointments. Bush judicial nominees who were Federalist Society members included John Roberts and Samuel Alito, both appointed to the Supreme Court, and about half the judges appointed to the courts of appeals.[64]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAt his May 2006 confirmation hearing to the District of Columbia Circuit, he stated that he was a registered Republican.[1] In 2018, Kavanaugh's reported salary was $220,600 as a federal judge and $27,000 as a lecturer at Harvard Law School.[304]\n\n\nIn 2022, Kavanaugh's home was the site of protests following the leak of a draft majority opinion for the Supreme Court case *Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization.*[305][306]\n\n\n\n## Publications[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter graduating from Georgetown Prep in 1983,[34] Kavanaugh went to Yale University, as had his paternal grandfather.[35][36] Several of Kavanaugh's Yale classmates remembered him as a \"serious but not showy student\" who loved sports, especially basketball.[37] He unsuccessfully tried out for the Yale Bulldogs men's basketball team and later played for two years on the junior varsity team.[37] He wrote articles about basketball and other sports for the *Yale Daily News*,[37] and was a member of the fraternity Delta Kappa Epsilon.[38][39] He graduated from Yale in 1987 with a Bachelor of Arts *cum laude* in history.[37]\n\n\nKavanaugh then attended Yale Law School, where he lived in a group house with future judge James E. Boasberg and played basketball with professor George L. Priest (sponsor of the school's Federalist Society).[40] He was a member of the *Yale Law Journal* and served as a notes editor during his third year. Kavanaugh graduated from Yale Law with a Juris Doctor degree in 1990.[41]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nKavanaugh was raised in Bethesda, Maryland. As a teenager, he attended Georgetown Preparatory School, a Jesuit boys' college prep school, where he was two years ahead of Neil Gorsuch, with whom he later clerked at the Supreme Court and eventually served with as a Supreme Court justice.[27][28] He was captain of the basketball team and was a wide receiver and cornerback on the football team.[29] Kavanaugh was also friends with classmate Mark Judge; both were in the same class with Maryland state senator Richard Madaleno.[30][31][32][33] In his yearbook Kavanaugh called himself a \"Renate Alumnius\", a reference to a female student at a nearby Catholic school.[34]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_yVdyPaUBkDR3lV2DkDTzY2Hg","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
