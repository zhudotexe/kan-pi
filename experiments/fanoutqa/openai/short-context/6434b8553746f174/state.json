Its nearest neighbour is Banaba of Kiribati, about 300\u00a0km (190\u00a0mi) to the east.[13] It lies northwest of Tuvalu, 1,300\u00a0km (810\u00a0mi) northeast of Solomon Islands,[14] east-northeast of Papua New Guinea, southeast of the Federated States of Micronesia and south of the Marshall Islands. With an area of only 21\u00a0km2 (8.1\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), Nauru is the third-smallest country in the world behind Vatican City and Monaco, making it the smallest republic and island nation.

The repatriation was motivated by significant layoffs in phosphate mining.[116]\n\n\nNauru is one of the most densely populated Westernized countries in the South Pacific.[136]\n\n\n\n### Ethnic groups[edit]\n\n\nFifty-eight per cent of people in Nauru are ethnically Nauruan, 26 per cent are other Pacific Islander, 8 per cent are European, and 8 per cent are Han Chinese.[3]\n\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Nauruan language\n\nThe official languages of Nauru are Nauruan and English.

The highest elevation is 4.6 metres (15\u00a0ft) above sea level on Niulakita. Due to the lack of land above sea level, Tuvalu is often referred to as the first country that will be totally submerged, due to climate change. Over four decades, there had been a net increase in land area of the islets of 73.5\u2009ha (2.9%), although the changes are not uniform, with 74% increasing and 27% decreasing in size. \n</fragment>\n</document>",

The nearest airport is also in Italy. The country's capital city, the City of San Marino, is located atop Monte Titano, while its largest settlement is Dogana within the largest municipality of Serravalle.

However, many other languages are also used by institutions situated within the state, such as the Holy See and the Swiss Guard, as well as personally by its diverse population.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nDuring the Roman Empire, Latin was the language spoken in the area corresponding to the present Vatican City. The subsequent Papal States also used Latin for official purposes during the first centuries of their existence. In 1870 the area became part of the Kingdom of Italy, whose official language was Italian.\n\n\nIn 1929 the Lateran Treaty established Vatican City as an independent state. The Fundamental Law of Vatican City State does not establish an official language, but its laws are published in Italian in a supplement to the *Acta Apostolicae Sedis* (official gazette of the Holy See), which is mainly in Latin.\n\n\nSince the state came into existence in 1929, most of the buildings situated within it predated it by centuries. Inscriptions can be found in them mainly in Latin, but also in Italian, Greek, French and German.[1][*better\u00a0source\u00a0needed*]\n\n\n\n## Present languages[edit]\n\n\nMany languages are spoken within the state, as its inhabitants come from many countries. Italian is the lingua franca of the Vatican and replaced Latin as the official language of the Synod of Bishops in 2014.[2] The Holy See, the entity with authority over the state (yet legally distinct), uses Latin as its official language and Italian as its main working language in administrative and diplomatic affairs. French is also sometimes used as a diplomatic language. In the Swiss Guard, Swiss German is the language used for giving commands, but the individual guards take their oath of loyalty in their own languages: German, French, Italian or Romansh.\n\n\nSince the state was established, the native languages of the popes have been Italian, German, Polish and Spanish.\n\n\n\n## Websites[edit]\n\n\nThe official website of Vatican City is in Italian.[3] Previous versions of the website were also available in English, French, German and Spanish.[4]\n\n\nThe official website of the Holy See is primarily in Italian, with versions in English, French, German, Portuguese and Spanish, and partial versions in Arabic, Chinese and Latin.[5] Some content is also available in many other languages, such as Albanian, Belarusian, Croatian, Czech, Dutch, Hebrew, Hungarian, Indonesian, Japanese, Korean, Lithuanian, Maltese, Polish, Russian, Slovak, Slovene, Swahili and Ukrainian.[6][7]\n\n\nThe Holy See's newspaper *L'Osservatore Romano* is published in Italian, English, French, German, Polish, Portuguese and Spanish.[8] The Vatican News website is available in many languages: Albanian, Amharic, Arabic, Armenian, Belarusian, Bulgarian, Chinese, Croatian, Czech, English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Latvian, Lithuanian, Hindi, Hungarian, Malayalam, Macedonian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Slovak, Slovene, Spanish, Swahili, Swedish, Tamil, Tigrinya, Ukrainian and Vietnamese.[9]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Vatican City portal\n* ![icon](image)Languages portal\n\n\n* Index of Vatican City-related articles\n* Ecclesiastical Latin, the form of Latin used by the Church in its documents.\n* Romanesco, the vernacular spoken in Rome around the Vatican City.\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Camposanto Teutonico\n2. **^** Peri, Claudio (October 6, 2014). \"Pope ditches Latin as official language of Vatican synod\".

Mon\u00e9gasque, a variety of the Ligurian language, is the national language of the Mon\u00e9gasque people. However, it is the primary language of very few people. There are several other languages spoken in addition to French and Mon\u00e9gaque, including Italian and English.\n\n\n\n\n## French[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Franco-Mon\u00e9gasque Treaties\n\nFrench is the only official\u2014and by far the most common\u2014language in Monaco, a result of the role France has had over the microstate, since the annexation of the County of Nice, which surrounds Monaco, in 1860.\n\n\n\n## Mon\u00e9gasque[edit]\n\n\nMon\u00e9gasque is the traditional national language of the Monegasque people (who represent only 21.6% of the total population[1]). It is a dialect of Ligurian, and is somewhat similar to Italian.\n\n\nBecause the Mon\u00e9gasques are only a minority in Monaco, their tongue was threatened with extinction in the 1970s.[*citation needed*] However, the language is now being taught in schools. In the old part of Monaco, the street signs are marked with Mon\u00e9gasque in addition to French.\n\n\nDuring his accession ceremonies in 2005, Albert II, Prince of Monaco, made a speech to his people in Mon\u00e9gasque.\n\n\n\n## Italian[edit]\n\n\nStandard Italian is also a major language in Monaco. Italian nationals make up 19% of the total population.[1]\n\n\nItalian was the ancestral language of the ruling House of Grimaldi, and was the official language of Monaco until 1860, when it was replaced by French.[2] This was due to the annexation of the surrounding County of Nice to France following the Treaty of Turin (1860).[2]\n\n\nItalian is also spoken by Caroline, Princess of Hanover and her children Andrea Casiraghi, Charlotte Casiraghi and Pierre Casiraghi, as her late husband was Italian.[3]\n\n\n\n## English[edit]\n\n\nThere is also an Anglophone community in Monaco (8.5% of which are from the United Kingdom or the United States, with English-speakers from other nations as too insignificant and thus listed within the category of \"other,\" below),[1] in addition to English-speaking tourists visiting the city.\n\n\nPrincess Grace was born an American, and all three of her children (including the reigning Prince) grew up speaking English among other languages.[4] The current princess consort of Monaco, Princess Charlene, is a native English speaker, having been born a Rhodesian in what is now Zimbabwe.\n\n\n\n## Occitan[edit]\n\n\nOccitan (*Lenga d'\u00f2c*) has also traditionally been spoken in Monaco, particularly when it covered a larger geographical territory, but is rarely used today.\n\n\n\n## Other[edit]\n\n\nIntemelio is a Ligurian dialect spoken historically from the Principality of Monaco to the Italian province of Imperia.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Outline of Monaco\n* History of Monaco\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Monaco IQ (English language), referencing Chapter One of Files and Reports&InfoSujet=General Population Census 2008&6Gb|2008 census (gouv.mc not an English source) Archived 27 September 2011 at the Wayback Machine\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Il monegasco, una lingua che si studia a scuola ed \u00e8 obbligatoria\" (in Italian).

The repatriation was motivated by significant layoffs in phosphate mining.[116]\n\n\nNauru is one of the most densely populated Westernized countries in the South Pacific.[136]\n\n\n\n### Ethnic groups[edit]\n\n\nFifty-eight per cent of people in Nauru are ethnically Nauruan, 26 per cent are other Pacific Islander, 8 per cent are European, and 8 per cent are Han Chinese.[3]\n\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Nauruan language\n\nThe official languages of Nauru are Nauruan and English. Nauruan[1] is a distinct Micronesian language, which is spoken by 96 per cent of ethnic Nauruans at home.[116] English is widely spoken and is the language of government and commerce.[3][4]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nCoat of arms\n |\n| **Motto:**\"God's will first\" |\n| **Anthem:**\u00a0*Nauru Bwiema*\"Nauru, our homeland\"  |\n| ![Location of Nauru](image) |\n| Capital | Yaren (*de facto*)[a]0\u00b031\u203239\u2033S 166\u00b056\u203206\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff0.52750\u00b0S 166.93500\u00b0E\ufeff / -0.52750; 166.93500 |\n| Largest city | Denigomodu |\n| Official\u00a0languages | * Nauruan[1]\n* English[2][b]\n |\n| Demonym(s) | Nauruan |\n| Government | Unitary parliamentary republic with an executive presidency under a non-partisan democracy[5] |\n|  |\n| \u2022\u00a0President\n | David Adeang |\n| \u2022\u00a0Speaker of the Parliament\n | Marcus Stephen |\n|  |\n| Legislature | Parliament |\n| Independence |\n|  |\n| \u2022\u00a0from UN trusteeship (from the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand)\n | 31 January 1968 |\n|  |\n| Area  |\n| \u2022\u00a0Total\n | 21\u00a0km2 (8.1\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) (193rd) |\n| \u2022\u00a0Water\u00a0(%)\n | 0.57 |\n| Population |\n| \u2022\u00a02020 estimate\n | 10,834[6][7] (227th) |\n| \u2022\u00a02011\u00a0census\n | 10,084[8] |\n| \u2022\u00a0Density\n | 480/km2 (1,243.2/sq\u00a0mi) (25th) |\n| GDP\u00a0(PPP) | 2021\u00a0estimate |\n| \u2022\u00a0Total\n | $132 million[9] (192nd) |\n| \u2022\u00a0Per capita\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n## Politics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Politics of Nauru and Elections in Nauru\n\nFurther information: Law of Nauru, List of political parties in Nauru, and Crime in Nauru\n\n![](image)Parliament of Nauru\nThe president of Nauru is David Adeang, who heads a 19-member unicameral parliament. The country is a member of the United Nations, the Commonwealth of Nations, and the Asian Development Bank. Nauru also participates in the Commonwealth and Olympic Games. Recently Nauru became a member country of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). The Republic of Nauru became the 189th member of the International Monetary Fund in April 2016.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNauru is a republic with a parliamentary system of government.[65] The president is both head of state and head of government and is dependent on parliamentary confidence to remain president. All 19 parliament seats are elected every three years.[79] The parliament elects the president from its members, and the president appoints a cabinet of five to six members.[80] As a result of a referendum in 2021, naturalised citizens and their descendants are barred from becoming parliamentarians.\n\n\nNauru does not have any formal structure for political parties, and candidates typically stand for office as independents; fifteen of the 19\u00a0members of the current Parliament are independents. Four parties that have been active in Nauruan politics are the Nauru Party, the Democratic Party, Nauru First and the Centre Party. However, alliances within the government are often formed based on extended family ties rather than party affiliation.[81]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Nauru does not have an official capital but Yaren is the seat of parliament.[1]\n2. **^** English is widely spoken by the majority of the population and it is commonly used in government, legislation and commerce alongside Nauruan. Because of Nauru's history and relationship with Australia, Australian English is the dominant variety.[3][4]\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** *Worldwide Government Directory with Intergovernmental Organizations*.

Its nearest neighbour is Banaba of Kiribati, about 300\u00a0km (190\u00a0mi) to the east.[13] It lies northwest of Tuvalu, 1,300\u00a0km (810\u00a0mi) northeast of Solomon Islands,[14] east-northeast of Papua New Guinea, southeast of the Federated States of Micronesia and south of the Marshall Islands. With an area of only 21\u00a0km2 (8.1\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), Nauru is the third-smallest country in the world behind Vatican City and Monaco, making it the smallest republic and island nation. Its population of about 10,800 is the world's second-smallest (not including colonies or overseas territories) after Vatican City.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Photo of a Nauruan warrior during the Nauruan Civil War around 1880\nNauru was first settled by Micronesians at least 3,000 years ago, and there is evidence of possible Polynesian influence.[20] Comparatively little is known of Nauruan prehistory,[21] although the island is believed to have had a long period of isolation, which accounts for the distinct language that developed among the inhabitants.[22] There were traditionally 12 clans or tribes on Nauru, which are represented in the twelve-pointed star on the country's flag.[23] Traditionally, Nauruans traced their descent matrilineally. Inhabitants practised aquaculture: they caught juvenile milkfish (known as *Ibija* in Nauruan), acclimatised them to freshwater, and raised them in Buada Lagoon, providing a reliable food source. The other locally grown components of their diet included coconuts and pandanus fruit.[24][25] The name \"Nauru\" may derive from the Nauruan word **An\u00e1oero**, which means 'I go to the beach.'[26]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

According to Tuvalu's constitution, the prime minister must always be a member of the parliament, and is elected by parliament in a secret ballot. Because there are no political parties in Tuvalu, any member of parliament can be nominated for the role. Following the parliamentary vote the governor-general of Tuvalu (as head of state) is responsible for swearing in as the prime minister the person who commands the confidence of a majority of members of parliament.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe office of prime minister was established when Tuvalu gained independence in 1978, although the post is sometimes considered to be a continuation of the earlier office of chief minister, which was created in 1975. If the prime minister dies, as has happened on one occasion, the deputy prime minister becomes acting prime minister until a new one is elected by parliament. The prime minister can lose his office by resigning, being defeated in a motion of no confidence by parliament, or losing his seat in a parliamentary election. \n\n\nSeveral former prime ministers have been appointed the governor-general of Tuvalu.\n\n\nKausea Natano is the incumbent prime minister, since 19 September 2019.\n\n\n\n## List of prime ministers[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nPrime ministers of Tuvalu\n |\n| --- |\n| * Toaripi Lauti\n* Tomasi Puapua\n* Bikenibeu Paeniu\n* Kamuta Latasi\n* Bikenibeu Paeniu\n* Ionatana Ionatana\n* Lagitupu Tuilimu *(acting)*\n* Faimalaga Luka\n* Koloa Talake\n* Saufatu Sopoanga\n* Maatia Toafa\n* Apisai Ielemia\n* Maatia Toafa\n* Willy Telavi\n* Enele Sopoaga\n* Kausea Natano\n* Feleti Teo\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nTuvalu\u00a0articles\n |\n| --- |\n| History | * Timeline of the history of Tuvalu\n* Migration of Polynesian people\n* 2011 drought\n | ![](image)\n |\n| Geography | \n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * Global warming\n* Funafuti Conservation Area\n* Protected areas\n* Villages and neighbourhoods\n |\n| Islands | * Funafuti\n* Nanumanga\n* Nanumea\n* Niulakita\n* Niutao\n* Nui\n* Nukufetau\n* Nukulaelae\n* Vaitupu\n |\n\n |\n\n |\n| Politics | \n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * Elections and parties\n* Foreign relations\n* Governor-General\n* Law enforcement\n* Human rights\n\t+ LGBT rights\n* Military\n* Monarchy\n* Parliament\n* Prime Minister\n |\n\n |\n| Economy | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * National Bank of Tuvalu\n* Tuvalu Trust Fund\n* Renewable energy\n* Telecommunications\n* Transport\n* Tuvalu Overseas Seamen's Union\n |\n\n |\n| Society | \n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * Crime\n* Culture\n* Demographics\n* Flag\n* Language\n* List of Tuvaluans\n* Music\n* Public holidays\n* Religion\n* Sport\n |\n\n |\n| * Outline\n\n* Category\n* Portal\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nHeads of state and government of Oceania\n |\n| --- |\n| Heads of state | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Sovereign states | * Australia\n* Fiji\n* Kiribati\n* Marshall Islands\n* Federated States of Micronesia\n* Nauru\n* New Zealand\n* Palau\n* Papua New Guinea\n* Samoa\n* Solomon Islands\n* Tonga\n* Tuvalu\n* Vanuatu\n |\n| Associated states of New Zealand | * Cook Islands\n* Niue\n |\n\n |\n| Heads of government | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| *Mrs. Teniku Talesi Honolulu*,*Samuelu Teo*,Sir Tofiga Vaevalu Falani |\n| 13\n | ![](image) | Kausea Natano(born 1957) | 2019 | 19 September 2019\n | Incumbent\n | 4\u00a0years, 268\u00a0days\n | Natano Ministry15th Ministry | **King Charles III** |\n\n\n**Notes**\n\n\n\n1. **^** Tuilimu served as acting prime minister following the death of Ionatana.[2][3]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Governor-General of Tuvalu\n* Politics of Tuvalu\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Tuvalu. \"PRESCRIPTION OF SALARIES ACT, 2008 Revised Edition\" (PDF). *tuvalu-legislation.tv*.\n2. **^** \"Tuvalu: Year In Review 2001\". *Britannica*. 2001.

Tuvaluan is of the Ellicean group of Polynesian languages, distantly related to all other Polynesian languages such as Hawaiian, M\u0101ori, Tahitian, Rapa Nui, Samoan and Tongan.[246] It is most closely related to the languages spoken on the Polynesian outliers in Micronesia and northern and central Melanesia. The Tuvaluan language has borrowed from the Samoan language, as a consequence of Christian missionaries in the late 19th and early 20th centuries being predominantly Samoan.[43][246]\n\n\nThe Tuvaluan language is spoken by virtually everyone, while a Micronesian language very similar to Gilbertese is spoken on Nui.[246][247] English is also an official language but is not spoken in daily use. Parliament and official functions are conducted in the Tuvaluan language.\n\n\nThere are about 13,000 Tuvaluan speakers worldwide.[248][249] Radio Tuvalu transmits Tuvaluan-language programming.\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Tuvalu\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNew Zealand has an annual quota of 75 Tuvaluans granted work permits under the *Pacific Access Category*, as announced in 2001.[242] The applicants register for the Pacific Access Category (PAC) ballots; the primary criterion is that the principal applicant must have a job offer from a New Zealand employer.[243] Tuvaluans also have access to seasonal employment in the horticulture and viticulture industries in New Zealand under the *Recognised Seasonal Employer* (RSE) Work Policy introduced in 2007 allowing for employment of up to 5,000 workers from Tuvalu and other Pacific islands.[244] Tuvaluans can participate in the Australian *Pacific Seasonal Worker Program*, which allows Pacific Islanders to obtain seasonal employment in the Australian agriculture industry, in particular, cotton and cane operations; fishing industry, in particular aquaculture; and with accommodation providers in the tourism industry.[245]\n\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tuvaluan language\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFrom 1974 (the creation of the British colony of Tuvalu) until independence, the legislative body of Tuvalu was called the *House of the Assembly* or *Fale I Fono*. Following independence in October 1978, the House of the Assembly was renamed the Parliament of Tuvalu or *Palamene o Tuvalu*.[93] The place at which the parliament sits is called the *Vaiaku maneapa*.[188] The *maneapa* on each island is an open meeting place where the chiefs and elders deliberate and make decisions.[188]\n\n\nThe unicameral Parliament has 16 members, with elections held every four years. The members of parliament select the Prime Minister (who is the head of government) and the Speaker of Parliament. The ministers that form the Cabinet are appointed by the Governor General on the advice of the Prime Minister. There are no formal political parties; election campaigns are largely based on personal/family ties and reputations.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n243. **^** \"Pacific Access Category\".

Its islands are situated about midway between Hawaii and Australia. They lie east-northeast of the Santa Cruz Islands (which belong to the Solomon Islands), northeast of Vanuatu, southeast of Nauru, south of Kiribati, west of Tokelau, northwest of Samoa and Wallis and Futuna, and north of Fiji. Tuvalu is composed of three reef islands and six atolls. They are spread out between the latitude of 5\u00b0 and 10\u00b0 south and between the longitude of 176\u00b0 and 180\u00b0. They lie west of the International Date Line.[8] The 2017 census determined that Tuvalu had a population of 10,645. The total land area of the islands of Tuvalu is 26 square kilometres (10\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* *Vaiaso ote Gana*, Tuvalu Language Week Education Resource 2016 (New Zealand Ministry for Pacific Peoples) Archived 7 March 2020 at the Wayback Machine\n* Besnier, Niko, (1995) *Literacy, Emotion and Authority: Reading and Writing on a Polynesian Atoll*, Cambridge University Press.

During their term of office, the officeholder is responsible for directing the work of the government and in charge of foreign relations. As the monarch's representative, the prime minister also presides (with voting powers) over the Council of Government, directs the executive services and commands the police and military.\n\n\nSince 1 September 2020, Pierre Dartout has been the prime minister.[2]\n\n\n\n\n## History of the office[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Official residence of the prime minister\nThe office was created in 1911 with the adoption of Monaco's constitution. Until the revision of the constitution of 2002, the prime minister had to be a French citizen,[*citation needed*] selected from several senior civil servants proposed by the French government. Since 2002, the prime minister can be either French or Monegasque and is chosen and appointed by the monarch, after consultation with the French government.\n\n\n\n## List of officeholders[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| No. | Portrait\n | Name(born\u2013died) | Term of office\n | Party\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Took office\n | Left office\n | Time in office\n |\n| 1\n | ![](image) | \u00c9mile Flach(1853\u20131926) | February 1911\n | December 1917\n | 6\u00a0years, 10\u00a0months\n |  | Independent |\n| \u2014\n |  | Georges Jaloustre(1875\u20131951)*acting* | January 1918\n | February 1919\n | 1\u00a0year, 1\u00a0month\n |\n| 2\n |  | Raymond Le Bourdon(1861\u20131937) | 19 February 1919\n | 11 August 1923\n | 4\u00a0years, 173\u00a0days\n |\n| 3\n |  | Maurice Piette(1871\u20131953) | 11 August 1923\n | February 1932\n | 8\u00a0years, 5\u00a0months\n |\n| \u2014\n |  | Henry Mauran(1899\u20131983)*acting* | January 1932\n | June 1932\n | 4\u00a0months\n |\n| 4\n | ![](image) | Maurice Bouilloux-Lafont(1875\u20131937) | June 1932\n | June 1937\n | 5\u00a0years\n |\n| \u2014\n |  | Henry Mauran(1899\u20131983)*acting* | June 1937\n | August 1937\n | 2\u00a0months\n |\n| 5\n | ![](image) | \u00c9mile Roblot(1886\u20131963) | 15 September 1937\n | 29 September 1944\n | 7\u00a0years, 14\u00a0days\n |\n| \u2014\n |  | Pierre Blanchy(1897\u20131981)*acting* | 29 September 1944\n | 13 October 1944\n | 14\u00a0days\n |\n| 6\n |  | Pierre de Witasse(1878\u20131956) | 13 October 1944\n | December 1948\n | 4\u00a0years, 1\u00a0month\n |\n| \u2014\n |  | Pierre Blanchy*acting* | 4 January 1949\n | 12 July 1949\n | 189\u00a0days\n |\n| 7\n |  | Jacques Rueff(1896\u20131978) | 12 July 1949\n | 1 August 1950\n | 1\u00a0year, 20\u00a0days\n |\n| 8\n | ![](image) | Pierre Voizard(1896\u20131982) | 1 August 1950\n | 2 September 1953\n | 3\u00a0years, 32\u00a0days\n |\n| 9\n |  | Henry Soum(1899\u20131983) | 15 November 1953\n | 12 February 1959\n | 5\u00a0years, 89\u00a0days\n |\n| 10\n | ![](image) | \u00c9mile Pelletier(1898\u20131975) | 12 February 1959\n | 23 January 1962\n | 2\u00a0years, 345\u00a0days\n |\n| \u2014\n |  | Pierre Blanchy*acting* | 23 January 1962\n | 16 August 1963\n | 1\u00a0year, 205\u00a0days\n |\n| 11\n |  | Jean Reymond(1912\u20131986) | 16 August 1963\n | 28 December 1966\n | 3\u00a0years, 134\u00a0days\n |\n| 12\n |  | Paul Demange(1906\u20131970) | 28 December 1966\n | 1 April 1969\n | 2\u00a0years, 94\u00a0days\n |\n| 13\n | ![](image) | Fran\u00e7ois-Didier Gregh(1906\u20131992) | 1 April 1969\n | 24 May 1972\n | 3\u00a0years, 53\u00a0days\n |\n| 14\n |  | Andr\u00e9 Saint-Mleux(1920\u20132012) | 24 May 1972\n | July 1981\n | 9\u00a0years, 1\u00a0month\n |\n| 15\n |  | Jean Herly(1920\u20131998) | July 1981\n | 16 September 1985\n | 4\u00a0years, 2\u00a0months\n |\n| 16\n |  | Jean Ausseil(1925\u20132001) | 16 September 1985\n | 16 February 1991\n | 6\u00a0years, 0\u00a0days\n |\n| 17\n | ![](image) | Jacques Dupont(1929\u20132002) | 16 February 1991\n | 2 December 1994\n | 3\u00a0years, 77\u00a0days\n |\n| 18\n |  | Paul Dijoud(born 1938) | 2 December 1994\n | 3 February 1997\n | 2\u00a0years, 63\u00a0days\n |\n| 19\n |  | Michel L\u00e9v\u00eaque(born 1933) | 3 February 1997\n | 5 January 2000\n | 2\u00a0years, 336\u00a0days\n |\n| 20\n |  | Patrick Leclercq(born 1938) | 5 January 2000\n | 1 May 2005\n | 5\u00a0years, 116\u00a0days\n |\n| 21\n |  | Jean-Paul Proust(1940\u20132010) | 1 May 2005\n | 29 March 2010\n | 4\u00a0years, 332\u00a0days\n |\n| 22\n | ![](image) | Michel Roger(born 1949) | 29 March 2010\n | 16 December 2015\n | 5\u00a0years, 262\u00a0days\n |\n| \u2014\n |  | Gilles Tonelli(born 1957)*acting* | 16 December 2015\n | 1 February 2016\n | 47\u00a0days\n |\n| 23\n | ![](image) | Serge Telle(born 1955) | 1 February 2016\n | 31 August 2020\n | 4\u00a0years, 212\u00a0days\n |\n| 24\n | ![](image) | Pierre Dartout(born 1954) | 1 September 2020\n | *Incumbent* | 3\u00a0years, 287\u00a0days\n |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Politics of Monaco\n* Monarchy of Monaco\n\t+ List of rulers of Monaco\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Laurens, Didier (2 May 2007). *Monaco, un pays ensoleill\u00e9 dirig\u00e9 par un prince magnifique*.
