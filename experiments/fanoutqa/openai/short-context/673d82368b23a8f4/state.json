The act called for a uniform exam to be administered for admission to Brooklyn Tech, Bronx Science, and Stuyvesant. The exam would become known as the Specialized High Schools Admissions Test (SHSAT) and tested students in Math and English. With its statewide recognition, the school had to become co-educational. Previous to this, Brooklyn Tech was All Boys, and had a sister school, Bay Ridge High School which was all girls.[19]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nNew York City Department of Education\n |\n| --- |\n| * Panel for Educational Policy\n* Public Schools Athletic League\n* Tweed Courthouse\n* New York City School Construction Authority\n* Specialized High Schools Admissions Test\n |\n| Schools | * List of public elementary schools\n* List of high schools in The Bronx\n* List of high schools in Brooklyn\n* List of high schools in Manhattan\n* List of high schools in Queens\n* List of high schools in Staten Island\n* School of One\n* Empowerment Schools\n |\n| Specializedhigh schools | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| The Bronx | * Bronx HS of Science\n* HS of American Studies at Lehman College\n |\n| Brooklyn | * Brooklyn Latin\n* Brooklyn Technical HS\n |\n| Manhattan | * Fiorello H.

An entrance examination was mandated for all applicants starting in 1934, and the school started accepting female students in 1969. Stuyvesant moved to its current location at Battery Park City in 1992 because the student body had become too large to be suitably accommodated in the original campus.

Brooklyn Tech is considered one of the country's most prestigious and selective high schools.[4][5]\n\n\nAdmission to Brooklyn Tech involves taking the Specialized High Schools Admissions Test and scoring the cutoff for Brooklyn Tech. Each November, about 30,000 eighth and ninth graders take the 3-hour test for admittance to eight of the nine specialized high schools. About 1,400 to 1,500 students are admitted each year.\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
