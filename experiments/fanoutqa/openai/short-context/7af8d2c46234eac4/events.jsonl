Milliken</title>\n<content>\nAmerican politician\n\nFor the academic administrator, see James Milliken (academic administrator). For other people with similar names, see James Milliken.\n\n\n**James Butler Milliken** (August 7, 1900 – August 11, 1988) was an American jurist and Democratic politician who served as a judge of the Kentucky Court of Appeals for 24 years from 1951 to 1975. During his period of service, the Court of Appeals was the highest court in Kentucky. The Kentucky Supreme Court was not created until 1975, the year Milliken retired. He served three terms as chief justice, 1956–57, 1963–64 and, 1971–73.\n\n\nMilliken was born in Louisville, Kentucky in 1900, grew up in Bellevue, Kentucky and graduated from Centre College where he was a member of Phi Kappa Tau fraternity. He graduated from Yale Law School in 1926. After two years at Yale, he returned home to teach math and English at Dayton (Kentucky) High School where he was also coach of the basketball team. In addition to teaching and coaching, he attended classes at the University of Cincinnati College of Law, eventually returning to Yale to graduate. He began his practice of law in Cincinnati and Campbell County, Kentucky where he became city attorney of Southgate, Kentucky. He later became a Kentucky State Representative and served as Chairman of the Kentucky Workers Compensation Board.\n\n\nDuring his tenure on the Court of Appeals, Milliken was an advocate for judicial reform and modernization. He was instrumental in bringing about a judicial retirement system in Kentucky and in the formation of the Kentucky Supreme Court.\n\n\nAfter his retirement from the bench on January 6, 1975, he taught constitutional law at the Salmon P. Chase College of Law and was given Chase's Distinguished Service Award.\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n* James B.

He is the former chancellor of the City University of New York, the largest urban university system in the U.S. from 2014 to 2018, after serving as president of the University of Nebraska from 2004 to 2014, where he was also a professor at the School of Public Affairs and at the College of Law.[1] He served as senior vice president of the University of North Carolina's 16-campus system from 1998 to 2004. Before his career in academic administration, Milliken practiced law in New York City.[2][3]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nMilliken was raised in Fremont, Nebraska. He received his bachelor of arts degree with distinction from the University of Nebraska–Lincoln, in 1979. While at Nebraska, Milliken was a member of the Phi Delta Theta fraternity.[4]\n\n\nAfter graduating from UNL, he spent a year working in Washington, D.C. as legislative assistant to Congresswoman Virginia D. Smith, R-Neb, who represented Nebraska's 3rd congressional district from 1975 to 1991.[5] Milliken earned a J.D.[6] degree in 1983 from New York University School of Law; he was a Root-Tilden Scholar and research assistant to Professor Norman Dorsen, then-president of the American Civil Liberties Union. After graduating from NYU Law, Milliken worked for the Legal Aid Society's Civil Division in New York City, then as an attorney at Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft.[7]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nMilliken was named Chancellor of the University of Texas System in August, 2018. The UT System Board of Regents touted Milliken's rich higher education experience over three decades and his track record of success in creating and executing strategic plans. [8]\n\n\nIn a radio interview with KUT in October, 2022, Milliken announced that the UT System had exceeded enrollment of 244,000 students,system-wide, for the first time in history. Milliken credited the system's enrollment growth to improved access through the UT Regents' Promise Plus endowment. Launched in 2022, Promise Plus is a $300 million endowment that was created by the UT System regents in order to reduce the cost of higher education for lower income students. The fund covers tuition at seven UT System universities and complements a similar need-based financial aid program at the University of Texas at Austin. [9]\n\n\nUnder Millken's watch as UT Chancellor the board of regents also invested in student well-being, approving a $16.5 million investment to \"expand and improve student mental health services, student safety and alcohol education resources\" at UT's 13 institutions. [10]\n\n\nPrior to his arrival in Texas, Milliken returned to his native Nebraska in 1988 where he accepted the position of executive assistant to the president of the University of Nebraska, and he was subsequently appointed Secretary to the Board of Regents and Vice President for External Affairs.[11]\n\n\nIn 1998, Milliken was appointed by then-president of the University of North Carolina, Molly Corbett Broad to lead university-wide strategy, institutional research, state and federal relations, public affairs, and economic development.[12] In 2000, Milliken helped pass a statewide referendum for a $3.1 billion bond issue for university and community college facilities.[13]\n\n\nMilliken was appointed president of the University of Nebraska in 2004. He worked to expand access and launched CollegeBound Nebraska, which provided free tuition to Nebraska Pell Grant recipients, University of Nebraska Online Worldwide, and Nebraska Innovation Campus, a public-private research and development park located on the former state fair grounds next to the University of Nebraska-Lincoln campus.[14][2] He subsequently led a $1.8 billion capital campaign,[15] funding new institutes for early childhood (Buffett Early Childhood Institute), global food and water sustainability (Daugherty Water for Food Global Institute) and rural sustainability (Rural Futures Institute).[2] Milliken also helped lead the Nebraska P-16 Initiative to improve primary education and increase college preparation.[16] He expanded the University's global reach, establishing new programs, with universities, the private sector and government, in China, India, Brazil and Turkey.\n\n\nMilliken became Chancellor of the City University of New York in 2014, and held the position through 2018.[17] While at CUNY, Milliken was lauded for improving access to higher education and expanded an initiative called ASAP, or Accelerated Study in Associate Programs, that provided financial help, including free MetroCard fare, and tutors. CUNY's graduation rates climbed and gained national recognition for the ASAP program. [18] In November 2016, an interim report of an investigation conducted by the office of New York State Inspector General found \"financial waste and abuse\", citing shoddy oversight and mismanagement that created a system ripe for financial waste and abuse, and criticized Milliken and CUNY General Counsel Frederick Schaffer, among others.[19][20] The 2016 report was based on findings that pre-dated Milliken's time as chancellor of CUNY and a group of New York city council members suggested New York State Governor Andrew Cuomowas using the report to politicize the system. [21] During the year preceding Milliken's resignation due to health concerns, Cuomo replaced CUNY Board of Trustees chairmen Benno C. Schmidt Jr. with a new chairmen Bill Thompson, and nearly all of the members of CUNY's board of trustees with a new politically prominent bloc. [22]\n\n\nMilliken is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations,[23] Business Higher Education Forum,[24] and on the executive committee of the Council on Competitiveness.[25] He formerly served as a director on the board of the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities (APLU), and led the Commission on Innovation, Competition and Economic Prosperity.[26]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nSince 1989, Milliken has been married to Nana Graves Hilliard Smith, a graduate of Yale University, and New York University School of Law.[27] They have three children.\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Who's Who in the Midwest, 38th, 39th Editions; Who's Who in America, 66th, 67th, 68th Editions\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Perry, Kate Howard (January 15, 2014). \"Leaving NU: J.B.

After Chemerinsky signed a contract on September 4, 2007, Drake rescinded the offer because he felt the law professor's commentaries were \"polarizing\"; Drake claimed the decision was his own and not the subject of any outside influence.[24]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDrake traveled over a weekend to meet with Chemerinsky in Durham, North Carolina, where Chemerinsky was a professor at the Duke University School of Law at the time, and the two reached an agreement.[27] On September 17, Chemerinsky issued a joint press release with Drake indicating that Chemerinsky would head the UCI law school.[28] On September 20, 2007, Chemerinsky's hire was formally approved by the Regents of the University of California.[29] In 2014, Chemerinsky said that he and Drake had since reconciled.[30]\n\n\n\n### Waters firing[edit]\n\n\nSee also: The Ohio State University Marching Band § 2014 hazing scandal\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n26. **^** \"A Bad Beginning in Irvine\". *The New York Times*.

In 2005, he was appointed as chairman of the Texas Tax Reform Commission.\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\nThe son of an oil field worker and a school teacher, Sharp grew up in the small farming community of Placedo in Victoria County[1] along the Texas Gulf Coast. In 1972, Sharp earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science from Texas A&M University in College Station, where he was a member of Squadron 6 in the Corps of Cadets and was elected Student Body President.[2] Upon graduation, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the United States Army Reserves. He belongs to American Legion Post 76 in Austin.\n\n\nIn 1973, started working as an analyst for the Texas Legislative Budget Board.[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* \"East & South Texas State Legislators Back Sharp in Senate Race\" (Capitol Annex, December 12, 2008)\n* \"John Sharp: Let marketplace govern energy industry\" (Written by John Sharp, San Antonio Express-News, June 28, 2008)\n* John Sharp is interviewed about the Texas Tax Reform Commission by Austin's KLRU-TV\n* \"More Welfare Waste – And A Lesson for Manufacturers\" (John Sharp and creation of the Lone Star Card) (Evolving Excellence, November 13, 2006)\n* Text of Governor's Appointment of John Sharp To Lead Tax Reform Panel (November 22, 2005)\n* \"State Comptroller elaborates on `Lone Star Scholars' idea\" (Amarillo Global News, January 23, 1998)\n* \"The U.S. Reform Experience: The National Performance Review\" (as inspired by John Sharp) (University of North Texas Libraries, 04/06/1997)\n* \"Sharp Drops Smart Bomb\" (Austin Chronicle, 02/09/1996)\n* \"Texas Official Is Model for Gore's Public Parsimony\" (New York Times, 09/12/1993)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1978, Sharp was elected to the Texas House of Representatives from the 40th District in Victoria and was later named \"Outstanding Freshman\" by *Texas Monthly*. Just a few weeks after his re-election for a third full two-year term in the general election of 1982, he ran and won a special election runoff and served a full four-year term in the Texas Senate. He was appointed to the powerful Senate Finance Committee. In 1986, he was elected to the Texas Railroad Commission.\n\n\nIn 1985, while in the state legislature, Sharp proposed a law restricting abortion rights in Texas.[4] Then-State Treasurer Ann Richards helped kill the bill.[5] When he ran for statewide office, Sharp moderated his anti-abortion views.[4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1976, Sharp received a master's degree in Public Administration from Texas State University in San Marcos while working full-time in Austin with the Legislative Budget Board.[3] In 1978, Sharp returned to Victoria, Texas, where he opened a real estate firm with partner and former County Commissioner Gene Martin and became a successful small business owner.\n\n\n\n## Texas politics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **contains content that is written like an advertisement**.

Texas State University presented Sharp with the \"Distinguished Alumnus Award\" in 1996, where he also taught a course on Texas state government for several semesters in the early 2000s.[28]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn March 7, 2023, a guest lecture by Texas A&M University professor Joy Alonzo at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) criticized Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick's role in the opioid crisis. Shortly afterward, Patrick contacted Sharp about Alonzo.[14][15] Alonzo was placed on administrative leave immediately, and was formally censured by UTMB. The investigation by Texas A&M found no evidence of wrongdoing, and Dr. Alonzo's leave was ended two weeks later.[14]\n\n\n\n### Leadership[edit]\n\n\nAs chancellor of The Texas A&M University System, Sharp has been involved with multiple initiatives:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* New Partnership Puts Texas A&M on Top, Chancellor Says[16]\n* Texas A&M System and GlaxoSmithKline receive U.S. Government approval to establish influenza vaccine facility in Texas[17]\n* Texas A&M Deal to Outsource Campus Services Formalized[18]\n* Texas A&M System Awarded National Center for Innovation[19]\n* Texas A&M University officially acquires Texas Wesleyan University law school[20]\n* Texas A&M System Launches EmpowerU Website[21]\n* Texas A&M lays accountability path for graduation rates, cost effectiveness[22]\n* Texas A&M System implementing outsourcing at other campuses[23]\n* Texas A&M University System Saving $10 Million of Healthcare[24]\n* Adding “Texas A&M” To More A&M System Agencies[25]\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nIn 1978, he married Charlotte Han. They have a son, Spencer, and a daughter, Victoria. Charlotte died in December of 2020.[26]\n\n\nHe owns a 1,600-acre ranch 30 minutes from College Station where he raises cattle and goats.[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2005, Sharp was asked to head an education task force – called the Texas Tax Reform Commission – charged with preparing a bi-partisan education plan for the state. The special session convened on April 17, 2006. Sharp accepted the offer and removed himself as a potential candidate for governor in 2006. The task force issued its final plan several months later, and the legislature adopted it.[10] Sharp was later nominated by the *Dallas Morning News* for \"Texan of the Year\".[11]\n\n\n\n### Senate campaign[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1990, Sharp was elected as the 35th State Comptroller of Public Accounts for the State of Texas. He was re-elected in 1994. In 1998, he did not seek a third term as comptroller but instead lost the race for lieutenant governor to Rick Perry, 50-48 percent. Sharp ran for lieutenant governor again in 2002, but was defeated 52-46 percent by David Dewhurst, then the Land Commissioner.\n\n\nUpon taking office as Comptroller, Sharp began working to fulfill his pledge to \"make government work more like our most successful businesses.\" During his eight years as Comptroller, Sharp established the Texas Performance Review (TPR), an ongoing audit on state government. During Sharp's two 4-year terms as Comptroller, the TPR identified more than $8.5 billion in taxpayer savings and changed the way government does business through the *Council on Competitive Government*.[6] Other innovative programs created and implemented by Sharp during these eight years included:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAmerican politician\n\nFor other people named John Sharp, see John Sharp (disambiguation).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn December 4, 2008, Republican U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison announced the creation of an exploratory committee for the Texas governor's race in 2010. Had she won the governorship, Hutchison would have been required to vacate her Senate seat by January 2011. If she were to stay in the Senate and not run for governor, she would have been up for re-election to the Senate in 2012. On December 8, 2008, Sharp became the first Democrat to announce his intention to run for this Senate seat, regardless of Hutchison's decision. Unlike several other candidates for the office, Sharp did not create an exploratory committee but immediately began raising funds and campaigning in 2009.[12]\n\n\n\n## Texas A&M University System[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n16. **^** Tribune, The Texas (June 19, 2013). \"New Partnership Puts Texas A&M on Top, Chancellor Says\".
