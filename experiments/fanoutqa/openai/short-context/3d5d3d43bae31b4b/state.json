A member of the Democratic Party, she previously served on the Phoenix City Council from 2014 to 2018.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nGallego grew up in Albuquerque, New Mexico.[2] Her parents are attorneys who moved to Albuquerque from Chicago after the 1979 Chicago blizzard.[3][4] She grew up with asthma, which made air quality important to her.[5]\n\n\nGallego graduated from Albuquerque Academy, where she served as student body vice president.[3] She earned a bachelor's degree in environmental science and public policy from Harvard College and a Master of Business Administration from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.[3][6]\n\n\n\n## Political career[edit]\n\n\nGallego worked for the Arizona Democratic Party, the Arizona Office of Tourism,[5] as well as on economic development and strategic planning for the Salt River Project. On November 5, 2013, Gallego was elected to the Phoenix City Council for the 8th district; she was reelected in 2017. With Greg Stanton, the Mayor of Phoenix, running for the United States House of Representatives in the 2018 elections, Gallego announced she would run in a special election to succeed him.[7] She resigned from the city council effective August 7, 2018.[8]\n\n\n\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\nThe city of Phoenix has nonpartisan mayoral elections. In the 2018 special election, Kate Gallego and Daniel Valenzuela advanced to a runoff in November of 2018. They defeated Moses Sanchez and Nicholas Sarwark. Although the election was nonpartisan, both candidates were Democrats. Previously on the city council, they had voted similarly. Kate Gallego defeated Daniel Valenzuela in the special general runoff election for the mayor of Phoenix in 2019. She received 58.6% of votes.[9] She assumed office on March 21, 2019. Gallego became the first woman elected to the office in more than three decades. She is only the second female mayor in Phoenix history and one of the youngest big city mayors in the United States.[10] She was backed by progressives, labor unions, the *Arizona Republic* editorial board, and liberal advocacy organizations. Examples of these include Emily's List, Sierra Club, and the Planned Parenthood Advocates of Arizona.[11]\n\n\nIn 2020, Kate Gallego ran for re-election. In November 2020, she was returned to office with the highest number of votes ever cast in a mayoral election. Merissa Hamilton, a Libertarian write in candidate, was Gallego's closest opponent. Hamilton received 26.29% of votes. Gallego won the election receiving 60.7% of the votes.[12]\n\n\n\n![](image)Gallego tours GateWay Community College with Secretary of Labor Marty Walsh\n### Climate change[edit]\n\n\nDuring Gallego's tenure as mayor, Phoenix has taken steps to counter the urban heat island effects which are aggravated by climate change.[13] Increasing temperatures in the Phoenix area are projected to cost billions of dollars per year.[14] Among the steps being taken are the creation of \"cool corridors\" through the planting of desert-adapted trees, and the use of lighter-colored sidewalks and streets, particularly in areas with high pedestrian traffic and little shade. Where to plant the trees is determined in part based on \"tree equity.\" The city uses an interactive tool from the nonprofit American Forests that grades shade in neighborhoods based on satellite images.[13][14] Phoenix has also opened one of the first city heat mitigation offices in the United States. It will support climate mitigation in Phoenix and share strategies with individuals and cities worldwide.[15]\n\n\n\n### Policing[edit]\n\n\nThe police department of Phoenix recorded shooting 44 people in 2018, spurring a reassessment from the community on police accountability. In 2020, Gallego suggested a plan for a citizens review board that would balance the police department interests and community interests. City councilman Carlos Garcia, who ran on further police accountability, created a plan focused on empowering a citizens review board from input of the community and groups such as Puente Human Rights and Poder in Action. The city council passed Garcia's model for a review board when Gallego and vice mayor Betty Guardados switched their votes from Gallego's model to the Garcia model with a 5\u20134 vote.[16]\n\n\nA Department of Justice investigation was initiated in August 2021 looking into if the police used excessive force on protestors and sweeping of homeless people and their property. The investigation planned to look at current police practices and its handling of the disabled.[17][18]\n\n\n\n### Housing[edit]\n\n\nGallego supported legislation that legalized accessory dwelling units on lots that were previously strictly zoned for single-family housing.[19]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nGallego is Jewish,[4] celebrating her bat mitzvah in Albuquerque.[3]\n\n\nWhile attending Harvard, Kate met Ruben Gallego at a charity auction following the September 11 attacks.[5] They moved to Phoenix in 2004,[2] and married in 2010. The couple announced their divorce in 2016, prior to the birth of their child, Michael.[20]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of mayors of the 50 largest cities in the United States\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Phi Beta Kappa elects 92 seniors to Harvard chapter\". *The Harvard Gazette*.

Nirenberg and Taylor finished with the two highest vote totals and advanced to a runoff election held June 10, 2017. Although Nirenberg trailed Taylor in the first municipal election, he went on to defeat Taylor 54.59\u201345.41% in the runoff election.[13] In so doing, Nirenberg became the first person in twenty years to defeat an incumbent mayor of San Antonio who sought re-election.[14][15]\n\n\n\n### 2019 San Antonio mayoral race[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2019 San Antonio mayoral election\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAs mayor-elect, Nirenberg called upon the city council to endorse the Paris climate accord even though U.S. President Donald Trump had announced plans to remove the United States from the agreement. The San Antonio City Council approved a resolution to sign the Paris climate accord one day after Nirenberg's election, and, in November 2017, the City Council approved the creation of a Climate Action and Adaptation Plan.[30][31][32] This would lead to San Antonio being one of 25 cities awarded the American Cities Climate Challenge grant in 2019 by Michael Bloomberg.[33]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n26. **^** August 2017 1, Christopher Hooks (July 26, 2017). \"Changing the Conversation\". *Texas Monthly*.

On May 6, 2023, the election was held and Nirenberg was re-elected with an unofficial count of over 61% of the vote.[4]\n\n\n\n## Tenure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Nirenberg as a candidate for mayor, 2015.\n![](image)Nirenberg (second from left) with Secretary of State Antony Blinken at the 2023 United States Conference of Mayors\nAlthough Nirenberg identifies as an independent[25] and ran for office as a nonpartisan politician,[a] he has been described as ideologically progressive.[26][27][28][29]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n6. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"San Antonio Elects Progressive Mayor Who Celebrates His Jewish Heritage\". *The Jewish Daily Forward*.

From 1852 to 1888, the city was run by a board of trustees and there was no elected mayor.

The mayor serves a four-year term and is limited to two successive terms.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe position of mayor was created when San Diego was first incorporated on March 27, 1850. However, the city went bankrupt in 1852, only two years after incorporation. As a result of the bankruptcy, the State of California dissolved the government and replaced the mayor and city council with a board of trustees.[1] The mayoral position was later re-established with a new charter in 1887.[2] This charter was replaced with a permanent City Charter on May 6, 1889, using the strong mayor form of government.\n\n\nIn 1931, a new charter was adopted using a council\u2013manager government with a citywide mayor as leader of the city council.\n\n\nIn November 2004, voters approved Proposition F, returning San Diego to the strong mayor form of government on a five-year trial basis. This was made permanent in June 2010 with the passage of Proposition D.[3]\n\n\n\n### Scandals[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n41. **^** \"Toni Atkins to serve as San Diego's deputy mayor until new mayor elected\". *San Diego Union-Tribune*.

The mayor also has the authority to dismiss the chief of police or the chief of the fire department subject to a council overrule. The mayor may recommend measures and ordinance to the city council, but may not vote on these items.\n\n\nOn or before January 15, the mayor is obligated to communicate a State of the City address to the city council. The mayor must also propose a budget to the city council and for public review no later than April 15.[18]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter San Diego's bankruptcy in 1852, the State of California took over city government and ran the city with an appointed Board of Trustees during 1852\u20131888.

The shortest term, not counting interim or acting mayors, was that of George P. Tebbetts, who served for less than two months before the position of mayor was abolished due to the bankruptcy of the city. Percy J. Benbough is the only mayor to have died in office. Two women have been elected mayor: Maureen O'Connor and Susan Golding consecutively. John F. Forward Sr. and John F. Forward Jr. are the only father and son to have both served as mayor.

Instead, they recommended exploring future pay increases with additional condition that council members voting for pay increases not be allowed to benefit from the increase. This recommendation was approved by the city council in a 5\u20133 vote in favor of the changes.[19] In November 2018, voters passed Measure L which ties future mayoral salaries to those of Superior Court judges.[21] As of December 2020, the mayoral salary is $206,000.[22]\n\n\n\n## Election and succession[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe mayor is elected in citywide election. Elections follow a two-round system. The first round of the election is called the primary election. The top-two candidates from the primary election advance to a runoff election, called the general election. Write-in candidates are only allowed to contest the primary election and are not allowed in the general election. The mayor is elected to a four-year term, with a limit of two consecutive terms.[23] The mayor is officially non-partisan by state law, although most mayoral candidates identify a party preference.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIf the office of the mayor becomes vacant with one year or less remaining in the term, the city council appoints a person to fill the vacancy. If the vacancy occurs with more than one year remaining, the city council is obligated to call a special election. The candidate with the majority of the votes in the special election is declared mayor. If no candidate receives a majority, a special run-off must be held between the two candidates with the highest number of votes. While the mayor's office is vacant pending a special election, the president of the city council serves as the interim mayor, with limited powers, until a new mayor is elected.[24] If for any reason a Mayor serves a partial term of two years or more, it will count as one full term.[18]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n7. **^** \"San Diego's Widening Pension Woes\". *Bloomberg BusinessWeek*.

The current mayor is Eric Johnson, who has served one term since 2019 and is the 60th mayor to serve in the position. Dallas operates under a city charter that designates the mayor as the official head of city government and a council-manager system where a city council-appointed city manager serves as the chief operating officer of the city.\n\n\n\n\n## Duties and powers[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe city of Dallas operates under a council-manager government type, putting the city of Dallas in a unique position as being one of the largest cities in the United States to utilize this municipal government structure. Unlike the more common form of government used by large cities known as the mayor-council government - where the mayor serves the chief-executive position of the city - the council-manager government of the city of Dallas gives the operational responsibility to the appointed City Manager. The mayor presides over city council meetings and official ceremonies and serves as a representative of the City of Dallas at the local, state, national, and international level. Likewise, it is not uncommon for mayors of the city of Dallas to simultaneously serve as members or heads of other committees while in office, further representing the interests of the people and city of Dallas in organizations and committees.\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Office of Mayor was created with the formation of the Dallas City Charter in 1856, also providing for the mayor six aldermen, a treasurer, recorder and a constable. In the charter, it was stated that each office would be elected for a term of one year.[1] In the reorganization of 1876, the mayor was elected to the office for a term of two years.[2] The office was first filled in the election of 1856, in which Dr. Samuel B. Pryor defeated A. D. Rice for the position.[3] A. D. Rice would run for office again and go on to serve as the 4th mayor of the city.\n\n\nFor much of the 19th century, mayors of the city of Dallas served for only one term. This precedence was broken at the end of Winship C. Connor's term, who \u2013 after serving three consecutive terms from 1887 to 1894 \u2013 would go on to be the city's longest consecutively serving mayor in the 19th century. His success was accredited to the development of the city's first water, power, and streetcar systems.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Samuel B. Pryor, the first mayor of Dallas.\n![](image)Stephen J. Hay, the first mayor elected under commission government and advocate for the White Rock Lake project.\n![](image)Earle Cabell, son and grandson of former mayors Ben E.

Note: municipal elections in Texas are non-partisan. The party affiliation of the Mayor is listed here for informational purposes only. [a]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe municipal government of Dallas underwent two significant structural changes during its history. The first change was made in 1907 where the city voted to change from an alderman system to a commission form of government. Stephen J. Hay was the first mayor elected in this new form of government, demonstrating the success of the highly debated commission form of government and contributing to the development of White Rock Lake in response to a water shortage in 1910. The second major government change was made in 1930, altering the commission form of government to specifically be a council-manager form. The first mayor to serve following this change was Tom Bradford, a successful grocer who was a significant financial contributor to the Bradford Memorial Hospital for Babies, the preliminary institution to the Children's Medical Center Dallas. He died after suffering a major heart attack in 1932 and was the first mayor of Dallas to die in office.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLaura Miller - the city's third female mayor, following Adlene Harrison and Annette Strauss - was instrumental in renegotiating the Wright Amendment to revise flight restrictions at Love Field Airport, as well as implementing a citywide smoking ban and an ordinance prohibiting sex-based discrimination. The following mayor Tom Leppert would impose a staunch crime-fighting policy, promote the economic development of a modern inland port, and was a vocal supporter of a controversial convention center hotel project at the peak of the 2008 recession. He would later vacate the office to pursue a US Senate campaign in 2012, of which he would place third in the runoff. Following the four-month incumbency of acting mayor Dwaine Caraway, mayor Mike Rawlings would be known for his vocal leadership during the 2014 Ebola outbreak, the 2016 shooting of Dallas police officers, and the removal of confederate monuments following the Charlottesville riots.\n\n\n\n## List[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 59 (62) | Mike Rawlings | 2011\n | 2019\n | 2\n |  | Democratic\n |\n| 60 (63)\n | Eric Johnson | 2019\n | 2023\n | less than 2\n |  | Democratic\n |\n| 2023\n | incumbent\n |  |  | Republican\n |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* History of Dallas\n\n\n### Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Term lengths changed many times during the multiple reorganizations of the Dallas City Charter.[4]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"01Chartr (1).pdf\" (PDF).

Following Earle Cabell was Mayor J. Erik Jonsson who funded and supported the then proposed Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport. As mayor, he went on to support public works projects such as developing the new Dallas City Hall, the Dallas Convention Center, and the Dallas Central Library - the last of which is now named in his honor. He was followed by Wes Wise who went on to further improve the city's image during his term from 1971 to 1973. However, he stepped down to pursue a political career in United States Congress before the end of his term. His pro-term mayoral successor, Adlene Harrison, stepped in and became acting mayor for the remainder of his term. She was the city's first female mayor, and the first female Jewish mayor in the United States. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRon Kirk was the first African-American mayor of the City of Dallas and served two terms from 1995 to 2002. As mayor, he led several efforts advocating for race equality and social welfare, mitigated tension between City Council and the Dallas School Board, advocated for economic development, and oversaw the construction of the American Airlines Center. He would later step down to pursue a seat in the US Senate, where he lost in the 2002 election to John Cornyn. After his defeat, he went on to become a lobbyist before being nominated and appointed by President Barack Obama to serve as United States Trade Representative from 2009 to 2013.\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

It was announced that he would take office on June 17, 2019.[12][13] With his election, Johnson became the second African-American mayor to be elected in Dallas history (the first being Ron Kirk) and one of the youngest mayors of a major American city. He was sworn in as mayor on June 17, 2019, by U.S. District Court Judge Sam Lindsay.[14]\n\n\n\n### Accomplishments[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Eric Lynn Johnson**[1] (born October 10, 1975) is an American politician and attorney who has served as the 60th mayor of Dallas, Texas since June 2019.
