For example, during a state visit by a foreign head of state, the president typically hosts a State Arrival Ceremony held on the South Lawn, a custom begun by John F. Kennedy in 1961.[111] This is followed by a state dinner given by the president which is held in the State Dining Room later in the evening.[112]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe **president of the United States** (**POTUS**)[A] is the head of state/head of government of the United States of America. The president directs the executive branch of the federal government and is the commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces.\n\n\nThe power of the presidency has grown substantially[11] since the first president, George Washington, took office in 1789.[6] While presidential power has ebbed and flowed over time, the presidency has played an increasingly significant role in American political life since the beginning of the 20th century, carrying over into the 21st century with notable expansions during the presidencies of Franklin D. Roosevelt and George W. Bush.[12][13] In modern times, the president is one of the world's most powerful political figures and the leader of the world's only remaining superpower.[14][15][16][17] As the leader of the nation with the largest economy by nominal GDP, the president possesses significant domestic and international hard and soft power.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n30.

The position of the United States as the leading member of NATO, and the country's strong relationships with other wealthy or democratic nations like those comprising the European Union, have led to the moniker that the president is the \"leader of the free world.\"\n\n\n\n## Selection process[edit]\n\n\n### Eligibility[edit]\n\n\nArticle II, Section 1, Clause 5 of the Constitution sets three qualifications for holding the presidency. To serve as president, one must:\n\n\n\n* be a natural-born citizen of the United States;\n* be at least 35 years old;\n* be a resident in the United States for at least 14 years.[124]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nPresidents of the United States\n |\n| --- |\n| Presidents andpresidencies | 1.

This organ adopts most national legislation, interprets the constitution and laws, and conducts constitutional reviews, and is headed by the chairman, one of China's top officials. The president represents China abroad, though since the 1990s, the presidency has always been held by the CCP general secretary. Elected separately by the NPC, the vice president has no power other than what the president bestowed on them but assists the president. The head of the State Council, the NPC's executive organ, is the premier. The CCP general secretary is China's leading official since the CCP is tasked with formulating and setting national policy which the state, after being adopted by the NPC or relevant state organ, is responsible for implementing.[1][2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe NPC generally has a reputation of approving the work of the State Council and not engaging in overmuch drafting of laws itself. However, it and its Standing Committee have occasionally asserted themselves. For example, the State Council and the CCP were unable to secure passage of a fuel tax in 2009 to finance the construction of expressways.[17][18] The NPC Standing Committee is more assertive than the NPC itself and has vetoed proposed laws.[11]: 79\n\n\n\n## Leadership[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of leaders of the People's Republic of China\n\n### National leadership[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of national leaders of the People's Republic of China\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Emblem of the Chinese Communist Party ![](image)Paramount leader and General Secretary Xi Jinping\nThe CCP Politburo Standing Committee consists of the government's top leadership. Historically it has had five to nine members, and currently has seven members. Its officially mandated purpose is to conduct policy discussions and make decisions on major issues when the Politburo, a larger decision-making body, is not in session. According to the CCP's constitution, the General Secretary of the Central Committee must also be a member of the CCP Politburo Standing Committee.[19][*better source needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_NJXULsQDwsNUbFF0yaJhXXyX","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

For that reason, some observers refer to the German political system as a \"chancellor democracy\". Even though the office of chancellor is often considered the most powerful in the German political system and is seen as such within the German public, it is only the third highest office, following the head of state, the President of Germany, and the President of the Bundestag, a position similar to the speaker of the federal parliament.\n\n\nWhichever major party (CDU/CSU or SPD) does not hold the chancellorship usually calls its leading candidate for the federal election \"chancellor-candidate\" (*Kanzlerkandidat*). The federal government (*Bundesregierung*) consists of the chancellor and cabinet ministers.\n\n\n\n### Role[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIV |\n| 9\n | ![](image) | **Olaf Scholz**(b. 1958) | December 8, 2021–*Incumbent* | 2 years, 188 days\n | SPD | Robert Habeck (*Incumbent*) | I |\n\n\n### Election mechanism[edit]\n\n\nThe chancellor is elected by the Bundestag and formally appointed by the president of Germany.

Since the inception of the cabinet system, the prime minister is known in Japanese as *Naikaku Sōri-Daijin* (内閣総理大臣) whenever he is referred to as the head of the Cabinet. However, this title is usually abbreviated to *Sōri-Daijin* (総理大臣). Other abbreviations include *Sōri* (総理), *Shushō* (首相) or even *Saishō* (宰相).[4]\n\n\n\n### English notation[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Africa\n* Arab world\n* Latin America\n* Oceania\n* Southeast Asia\n* European Union\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n* United Nations\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n* G20\n* G7\n |\n| ![flag](image) Japan portal * Other countries\n |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\nThe **prime minister of Japan** (Japanese: 内閣総理大臣, Hepburn: *Naikaku Sōri-Daijin*) is the head of government of Japan. The prime minister chairs the Cabinet of Japan and has the ability to select and dismiss its ministers of state. The prime minister also serves as the commander-in-chief of the Japan Self Defence Forces[2] and is a sitting member of either house of the National Diet (typically the House of Representatives). The individual is appointed by the emperor of Japan after being nominated by the National Diet (the parliament). The prime minister must retain the confidence of the House of Representatives to remain in office.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nUnder this system, the *Daijō-daijin* (太政大臣, Chancellor of the Realm)[6] was the head of the *Daijō-kan* (Department of State), the highest organ of Japan's pre-modern Imperial government during the Heian period and until briefly under the Meiji Constitution with the appointment of Sanjō Sanetomi in 1871. The office was replaced in 1885 with the appointment of Itō Hirobumi to the new position of Minister President of State,[7] four years before the enactment of the Meiji Constitution, which mentions neither the Cabinet nor the position of Prime Minister explicitly.[8][9] It took its current form with the adoption of the Constitution of Japan in 1947.\n\n\nTo date, 64 people have served this position. The longest serving prime minister to date is Shinzo Abe, who served as prime minister in two terms: from 26 September 2006 until 26 September 2007, and from 26 December 2012 until 16 September 2020.[10]\n\n\n\n## Appointment[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Shōwa era, 1947–89 | * Katayama\n* Ashida\n* Yoshida\n* I.

In most other constitutional monarchies, the monarch is nominal chief executive, while being bound by convention to act on the advice of the cabinet. In contrast, the Constitution of Japan explicitly vests executive power in the Cabinet, of which the prime minister is the leader. His countersignature is required for all laws and Cabinet orders. While most ministers in parliamentary democracies have some freedom of action within the bounds of cabinet collective responsibility, the Japanese Cabinet is effectively an extension of the prime minister's authority.\n\n\n\n## Insignia[edit]\n\n\n* ![Standard of the Prime Minister](image)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n7. **^** Legal framework for Prime Minister and Cabinet in the Empire: Dajōkan proclamation No. 69 of 22 December 1885 (内閣職権, *naikaku shokken*)[*permanent dead link*], later replaced by Imperial edict No. 135 of 1889 (内閣官制, *naikaku kansei*) Archived March 3, 2016, at the Wayback Machine in effect until 1947\n8. **^** Article 55 of the Imperial Constitution only bound the ministers of state, i.e. all members of the cabinet including the prime minister, to \"give their advice to the Emperor and be responsible for it.\"\n9. **^** Kantei: Cabinet System of Japan\n10. **^** \"Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe officially resigns\". *CBSNews*.

The original Kantei served from 1929 until 2002, when a new building was inaugurated to serve as the current Kantei.[24] The old Kantei was then converted into the Official Residence, or *Kōtei* (公邸).[25] The Kōtei lies to the southwest of the Kantei, and is linked by a walkway.[25]\n\n\n\n## Travel[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Japanese Air Force One\n\nSee also: Prime Minister's Official Car (Japan)\n\nThe prime minister of Japan travels in a Toyota Century, which replaced the Lexus LS 600h L in 2019.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nUntil the mid-1930s, the prime minister of Japan was normally granted a hereditary peerage (*kazoku*) prior to leaving office if he had not already been ennobled. Titles were usually bestowed in the ranks of count, viscount or baron, depending on the relative accomplishments and status of the prime minister. The two highest ranks, marquess and prince, were only bestowed upon highly distinguished statesmen, and were not granted to a prime minister after 1928. The last prime minister who was a peer was Baron Kijūrō Shidehara, who served as Prime Minister from October 1945 to May 1946. The peerage was abolished when the Constitution of Japan came into effect in May 1947.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* **Justices of the Supreme Court**\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n* Intellectual Property High Court\n |\n| Bank of Japan\n* **Governor**\n\n\nKazuo Ueda\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n* Japanese yen\n* Banknotes\n* Coins\n |\n| Elections\n* List of districts of the House of Representatives of Japan\n* List of districts of the House of Councillors of Japan\n* Japanese House of Councillors national proportional representation block\n* Political parties\n\n\n\n\n**Japanese general elections**\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n* 1890\n* 1892\n* 1894 (Mar)\n* 1894 (Sep)\n* 1898 (Mar)\n* 1898 (Aug)\n* 1902\n* 1903\n* 1904\n* 1908\n* 1912\n* 1915\n* 1917\n* 1920\n* 1924\n* 1928\n* 1930\n* 1932\n* 1936\n* 1937\n* 1942\n* 1946\n* 1947\n* 1949\n* 1952\n* 1953\n* 1955\n* 1958\n* 1960\n* 1963\n* 1967\n* 1969\n* 1972\n* 1976\n* 1979\n* 1980\n* 1983\n* 1986\n* 1990\n* 1993\n* 1996\n* 2000\n* 2003\n* 2005\n* 2009\n* 2012\n* 2014\n* 2017\n* 2021\n* *Next*\n\n\n\n**Japanese House of Councillors elections**\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_qoMJQHnZkMlqvx1s5aA4Vhc0","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
