Films that have not played since then do not appear on the chart due to ticket price inflation, population size, and ticket purchasing trends not being considered. If inflation were adjusted for, *Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs* would appear at the top of the chart with an adjusted gross of $1,977,000,000.[2][nb 1] All except two—*The Simpsons Movie* and the original 1994 version of *The Lion King*—are computer-animated films. *Despicable Me* is the most represented franchise with all five films in the top 50 highest-grossing animated films. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe top 48 films listed are also among the 50 highest-grossing animated films and the top 11 are among the 50 highest-grossing films, each having grossed in excess of $1 billion worldwide.\n\n\n\n† *Background shading indicates films playing in the week commencing 7 June 2024 in theaters around the world*.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | $100,000,000 | [# 4][# 5] |\n\n\n* ( ... ) Since grosses are not limited to original theatrical runs, a film's first-run gross is included in brackets after the total if known.\n* \\*U.S. and Canada gross only\n* ITItaly only\n* ESSpanish only\n* SWSwedish gross only\n* NWNorwegian gross only\n* AUAustralian gross only\n* JPJapanese gross only\n* RDistributor rental\n* TBDTo be determined\n* N/ANot applicable; no animated feature length film was released in that year.\n* HFilms contain animated/live-action scenes.\n\n\n## Timeline of highest-grossing animated films[edit]\n\n\nAt least eight animated films have held the record of highest-grossing animated film at different times.

Disney also did not describe it as live-action, only stating it would follow the \"technologically groundbreaking\" approach of *The Jungle Book*.[23] While the film acts as a remake of the 1994 animated film, Favreau was inspired by the Broadway adaptation of the film for certain aspects of the remake's plot, particularly Nala and Sarabi's roles.[24] Favreau also aimed to develop his own take on the original film's story with what he said was the spectacle of a BBC wildlife documentary.[25]\n\n\nThis serves as the final credit for film editor Mark Livolsi, who died in September 2018.[26] The film is dedicated to him.[1]\n\n\n\n### Casting[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n47. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Trigg, Eric (December 23, 2018). \"Disney's The Lion King Won't Be A Shot-for-Shot Remake of Animated Original\". *Screen Rant*.

Movie*: \"To me, this is a movie that's been like 40 years in the making, you know, and I've always considered Mario more of an action game. The characters look comedic, but the story is always high stakes, you gotta save the princess or save the world or whatever in the game. So we wanted to reflect that action sensibility.\" The two brought in artists they knew from television and worked closely with them to craft the film's action sequences. Skudder in particular was crucial in making the action, especially the Rainbow Road sequence. According to Jelenic and Horvath, Skudder spent months working on the sequence, which they also described as the film's most technically challenging. The road itself was a visual effect, and every shot of it had to go through the visual effects department, which was time-consuming and expensive.[51]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n6. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** Murphy, J.

Movie* is in many ways a feature-length advertisement for Nintendo as a brand. However, Jelenic, Horvath, and [F]ogel make this feel more like a labor of love, as they've been given the keys to the (Mushroom) kingdom, and are allowed to go all-in with what any fan would want to see in a film like this. In many ways, *The Super Mario Bros. Movie* reminds of *Wreck-It Ralph* and the glee that came from seeing these characters on screen.\"[129] Writing for the *Datebook* section of *The San Francisco Chronicle*, Zaki Hasan said he enjoyed the visuals but felt the film's strong adherence to and copious references to the games left it lacking in narrative, and that it tried too hard to avoid the failures of the 1993 film, calling it \"a blandly efficient piece of brand management\".[130]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter the critical and commercial failure of the live-action film *Super Mario Bros.* (1993), Nintendo became reluctant to license its intellectual properties for film adaptations. *Mario* creator Shigeru Miyamoto became interested in developing another film during the development of the Virtual Console service. Through Nintendo's work with Universal Parks & Resorts to create Super Nintendo World, he met with Illumination CEO Chris Meledandri. By 2016, they were discussing a *Mario* film and, in January 2018, Nintendo announced that it would produce it with Illumination and Universal.
