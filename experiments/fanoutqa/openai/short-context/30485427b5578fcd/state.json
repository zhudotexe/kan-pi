Such fluctuations change a country's ranking from one year to the next, even though they often make little or no difference to the standard of living of its population.\n\n\nGDP per capita is often considered an indicator of a country's standard of living;[1][2] however, this is inaccurate because GDP per capita is not a measure of personal income.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nComparisons of national income are also frequently made on the basis of purchasing power parity (PPP), to adjust for differences in the cost of living in different countries. (*see* List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita). PPP largely removes the exchange rate problem but not others; it does not reflect the value of economic output in international trade, and it also requires more estimation than GDP per capita. On the whole, PPP per capita figures are more narrowly spread than nominal GDP per capita figures.\n\n\nNon-sovereign entities (the world, continents, and some dependent territories) and states with limited international recognition (such as Kosovo, Palestine, and Taiwan) are included in the list in cases in which they appear in the sources. These economies are not ranked in the charts here, but are listed in sequence by GDP for comparison. In addition, non-sovereign entities are marked in *italics*.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNote that several leading GDP-per-capita (nominal) jurisdictions may be considered tax havens, and their GDP data subject to material distortion by tax planning activities. Examples include Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, Ireland, and Luxembourg.[3]\n\n\n*All data are in current United States dollars.

Mexico and Caribbean nations of the Commonwealth of Nations are between the economic extremes of the development of North America.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n7. **^** International Monetary Fund (2022). \"GDP PPP per capita\". *IMF Data Mapper*.

The United States is by far the largest economy in North America and the largest national economy in the world.\n\n\nThe US, Canada and Mexico have significant and multifaceted economic systems.[11] In 2011, the US has an estimated per capita gross domestic product (PPP) of $47,200, and is the most technologically developed economy in North America.[11] The United States' services sector comprises 80% of the country's GDP (estimated in 2017), industry comprises 19.1% and agriculture comprises 0.9%.[11]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"World Population Prospects 2022\".

In western Canada, in the provinces of Saskatchewan, Alberta, British Columbia and Manitoba, wheat and other various main agricultural products are grown. The U.S. also has many states with significant agriculture production, mainly in the central continental U.S. Mexico produces many tropical fruits and vegetables as well as edible animals.\n\n\n\n### Manufacturing[edit]\n\n\nNorth America has developed and its manufacturing sector has grown. In the beginning the European nations were the large manufacturing powers. At the start of the 1950s, the United States was a top manufacturing power, with Canada and Mexico also making significant progress.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is an agreement between Canada, Mexico and the United States to eliminate tariffs on goods traded between themselves.\n\n\nAlthough currently only a trade agreement, with no supranational bodies or laws as in the European Union, there have been various proposals to move towards a customs union or a North American currency union. It is unknown whether this may eventually develop into a North American Union similar to that of Europe.\n\n\n\n## Currency[edit]\n\n\nBelow is a **list of the currencies of North America**, with exchange rates between each currency and both the *euro* and *US dollars* as of 20 July 2022. This list may vary as it is not current.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n### Service[edit]\n\n\nIn Canada, the US and the Caribbean, service-based employment is a significant percentage of overall employment. Many people work in stores and other retail locations. In Canada more than 70% work in the services sector, with a similar percentage in the United States.\n\n\n\n### Investment and banking[edit]\n\n\nThe United States leads North America in investment and banking. Canada, Mexico and most recently, February 2011, El Salvador is growing in this sector. And smaller economic powers such as Guatemala, Honduras, Costa Rica, and Panama are also growing slowly in this sector.\n\n\n\n### Tourism[edit]\n\n\nTourism is extremely important for the Caribbean economies, as they contain many beaches and have warm climates. Skiing in Canada and the US is also important. Tourism of national parks and natural landmarks, such as Mount Rushmore and the Grand Canyon in the United States, and Niagara Falls and Moraine lake in Canada, contribute to the economy in these regions.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This article **needs additional citations for verification**.

Such fluctuations change a country's ranking from one year to the next, even though they often make little or no difference to the standard of living of its population. Therefore, these figures should be regarded with caution. GDP per capita is often considered an indicator of a country's standard of living;[1][2] however, this is problematic because GDP per capita is not a measure of personal income.\n\n\n\n\n## List of sovereign states in Europe by GDP (nominal) per capita 2021[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* List of sovereign states in Europe by GDP (PPP) per capita\n* International organisations in Europe\n* List of European countries by budget revenues\n* List of European countries by budget revenues per capita\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** *O'Sullivan, Arthur*[*full citation needed*]\n2. **^** French President seeks alternatives to GDP, The Guardian 14-09-2009.  \n\"European Parliament, Policy Department Economic and Scientific Policy: Beyond GDP Study\" (PDF).\u00a0(1.47\u00a0MB)\n3. **^** \"IMF GDP nominal per capita - international dollar\".\n4. **^** GDP per capita (current US$) retrieved on 26 April 2021\n5. **^** \"IMF WEO April 2021 Edition GDP (PPP) per capita \u2013 international dollars\".\n6. **^** \"World Bank (01 July 2017 Edition) GDP nominal per capita - international dollar\".\n7. **^** \"World Economic Outlook Database\". *IMF*.

Slovakia has the highest GDP growth in the period 2005\u20132015 among all countries of the European Union (See Tatra Tiger). Notably the Baltic states have achieved high GDP growth, with Latvia topping 11%, close to China, the world leader at 9% on average for the past 25 years (though these gains have been in great part cancelled by the late-2000s recession).[85]\n\n\nReasons for this growth include government commitments to stable monetary policy, export-oriented trade policies, low flat-tax rates and the utilisation of relatively cheap labour. In 2015 Ireland had the highest GDP growth of all the states in EU (25.1%).\nThe current map of EU growth is one of huge regional variation, with the larger economies suffering from stagnant growth and most of the newer states enjoying sustained, robust economic growth.\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

The region includes several of the world's largest and most prosperous economies: Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, China, Hong Kong, and Macau. It is home to some of the most economically dynamic places in the world,[70] being the site of some of the world's most extended modern economic booms, including the Taiwan miracle (1950\u2013present) in Taiwan, Miracle on the Han River (1974\u2013present) in South Korea, Japanese economic miracle (1950\u20131990) and the Chinese economic miracle (1983\u20132010) in China.[71][72]\n\n#### Economy of South Asia[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThis is an alphabetically sorted list of Asian countries, with their factual and estimated gross domestic product data by the International Monetary Fund.[19]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAccording to the World Bank, China surpassed the United States and the European Union to become the world's largest economy in terms of purchasing power by early 2015, followed by India. Both countries are expected to rank in the same positions between 2020 and 2040.[64] Moreover, based on Hurun Report, for the first time in 2012 Asia surpassed North America in amount of billionaires.[65] 951 billionaires came from Asia, whereas North America had 777 billionaires and Europe with 536 billionaires.[66]\n\n\nBusinesses anticipate that it will take an average of five months for revenues to return to pre-pandemic levels and two months for the workforce to do the same. It is anticipated that Central Asian nations will be more severely impacted. Only 4% of those businesses that were permanently closed anticipate to open again, with the impacted industries' levels of heterogeneity ranging from 3% in the lodging and food services sector to 27% in the retail trade sector.[67][68][69]\n\n\n\n## Regional variation[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs in all world regions, the wealth of Asia differs widely between, and within, states. This is due to its vast size, meaning a huge range of different cultures, environments, historical ties and government systems. The largest economies in Asia in terms of PPP gross domestic product (GDP) are China, India, Japan, Indonesia, Turkey, Taiwan, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Thailand, Pakistan and Bangladesh and in terms of nominal gross domestic product (GDP) are Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, China, India, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Thailand and Iran.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nChina (manufacturing and FDI-led growth[15]) and India (commodities, outsourcing destination and computer software) are the two fastest growing major economies in the world.\n\n\nEast Asian and ASEAN countries generally rely on manufacturing and trade (and then gradually upgrade to industry and commerce[16]), and incrementally building on high-tech industry and financial industry[17] for growth, countries in the Middle East depend more on engineering to overcome climate difficulties for economic growth and the production of commodities, principally Sweet crude oil.[18] Over the years, with rapid economic growth and large trade surplus with the rest of the world, Asia has accumulated over US$8.5 trillion of foreign exchange reserves \u2013 more than half of the world's total, and adding tertiary and quaternary sectors to expand in the share of Asia's economy.\n\n\n\n\n## List of Asian countries by GDP[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| territory\n | GDP nominalmillions of USD (2022)\n | GDP nominal per capitaUSD (2022)\n | GDP PPPmillions of USD\n | GDP PPP per capitaUSD\n | Location\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Average** | 41,758,906\n | 8,922\n | 65,441,000\n | 15,235\n |  |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Afghanistan | 20,136\n | 611\n | 76,486\n | 2,094\n | South Asia\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Armenia | 14,047\n | 4,741\n | 32,909\n | 11,083\n | West Asia\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Azerbaijan | 73,369\n | 7,165\n | 187,260\n | 18,615\n | West Asia\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Bahrain | 44,169\n | 29,103\n | 76,951\n | 50,931\n | West Asia\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Bangladesh | 460,700\n | 2735\n | 1,350,000\n | 7984\n | South Asia\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Bhutan | 2,653\n | 3,491\n | 8,199\n | 9,876\n | South Asia\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Brunei | 35,555\n | 79,816\n | 35,920\n | 80,383\n | Southeast Asia\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Cyprus | 27,726\n | 30,663\n | 38,055\n | 42,956\n | West Asia\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Myanmar | 69,262\n | 1,285\n | 355,609\n | 6,707\n | Southeast Asia\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Cambodia | 28,020\n | 1,752\n | 76,934\n | 4,664\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n60. **^** \"East Asia and Pacific: Pandemic \"Triple Shock\" Hitting Economies Across Region\". *World Bank*.

This increasingly means that the interchangeability of the Euro, USD, and GBP are heavily influenced by Asian central banks. Some economists in the western countries see this as a negative influence, prompting their respective governments to take action.[63]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFrom 1995 to 2005, share of Asian foreign exchange reserves had risen from 46 percent to 67 percent.

This free trade zone allows international trade to be conducted with fewer restrictions and lower customs duties. The zone is tax free for the first ten years to encourage foreign direct investment (FDI) with a 'negative list' used to regulate in which fields foreign investments are prohibited.[56][57] In 2018, India has overtaken Japan as the second largest economy in Asia and the third largest overall in the world, while China has overtaken the U.S. in terms of purchasing power parity or GDP (PPP) in the world, marking the first time in almost 2 centuries that any country outside the Americas and Europe has taken the top spot globally.\n\n\n\n#### 2020-present[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThis section is an excerpt from Economy of South Asia.[edit]\n![](image)Development of GDP per capita of economies in South Asia\n\n### Recent reforms in China[edit]\n\n\nFollowing a Third Plenum of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in 2013 China revealed plans for several sweeping social and economic reforms. The government would relax its one-child policy to allow single-child parents to have two kids. This reform was implemented as a response to the aging population of China and provide more labor. The government also reformed the hukou system, allowing the labor force to become more mobile.[73]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMeanwhile, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore emerged as the Four Asian Tigers with their GDPs growing well above 7% per year in the 1980s and the 1990s. Their economies were mainly driven by growing exports.[44] The Philippines only began to open up its stagnated economy in the early 1990s.[45] Vietnam's economy began to grow in 1995, shortly after the United States and Vietnam restored economic and political ties.[46]\n\n\nThroughout the 1990s, the manufacturing ability and cheap labor markets in Asian developing nations allowed companies to establish themselves in many of the industries previously dominated by companies from developed nations. By the dawn of the 21st century, Asia became the world's largest continental source of automobiles, machinery, audio equipment and other electronics.[47]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

It encompasses 6 percent of the world's population.\n\n\nFrom the 1930s to 1980s, countries of South America used Import Substitution, an economic policy that replaces foreign businesses as well as imports with domestic production. This was a policy made to increase domestic manufacturing. Furthermore, national spending on arms soared during periods of military rule. Increasingly South American countries began to borrow from foreign private banks and international lending institutions, such as the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank, to fund existing programs while also trying to expand their economic productivity through investments. However, this policy created a debt crisis in South America.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n132. **^** html CIA. The World Factbook.

Please note that the number of tourists does not always reflect the monetary amount the country gets from tourism. Some countries carry out higher level tourism, obtaining more benefits. Tourism in South America is still little evolved: in Europe, for example, countries obtain annual tourist values such as U $73.7 billion (Spain), or U $67.3 billion (France). \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe report showed that by December 2016, the Brazilian coffee industry generated US$557 million in revenue by exporting 3.07 million bags of coffee.[16] Additionally, in 2016 soybeans, grown in South America's temperate climates, had an export value of US$19B for Brazil , representing 10.4% of the total exports,[17] and one of US$3.23B for Argentina, representing 5.7% of the country's total exports.[18] Moreover, the soybean meal exportation represent 17.5% of Argentina's total exports, with an export value of $9.96B.[18]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"World Population Prospects 2022\".

Other countries in the region were observing slowdown in growth rates.[12] Brazil saw this decline in output due to increasing unemployment level, worsening financial conditions and political issues, which, in turn, lead to decrease in private domestic consumption and investment.[12] Argentina also experienced recession in private consumption and investment, however it was because of removal of public service subsidies due to short-term rise in inflation. In contrast, Peru differed from other countries in the region - demonstrating increase in growth rates thanks to copper production.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPortico of the Democrata men's shoe factory in Franca.
