Note the use of the Italian language.\nVatican City has no formally enacted official language, but, unlike the Holy See which most often uses Latin for the authoritative version of its official documents, Vatican City uses only Italian in its legislation and official communications.[118] Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those who work in the state. In the Swiss Guard, Swiss German is the language used for giving commands, but the individual guards take their oath of loyalty in their own languages: German, French, Italian or Romansh. The official websites of the Holy See[119] and of Vatican City[120] are primarily in Italian, with versions of their pages in a large number of languages to varying extents.\n\n\n\n### Citizenship[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Reuters Staff (6 October 2014). \"Pope ditches Latin as official language of Vatican synod\". *Reuters*.\n2. **^** \"What language is spoken at the Vatican?\". *Visiting The Vatican*. 13 April 2023.

The Swiss Guard, in which commands on parade are given in German, also uses French and Italian, two of the three other official Swiss languages, in its official ceremonies, such as the annual swearing in of the new recruits on 6 May.[3]\n2. **^** All powers delegated by the sovereign[9][10]\n3. ^ ***a*** ***b*** The De Agostini Atlas Calendar listed the area of Vatican City as 44\u00a0ha in its 1930 edition[11] but corrected it to 49\u00a0ha in its 1945\u20131946 edition.[12] The figure of 44\u00a0ha is still widely cited by many sources despite its inaccuracy.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n4. **^** Visitors and tourists are not permitted to drive inside Vatican City without specific permission, which is normally granted only to those on official business in Vatican City.\n5. **^** ITU-T assigned code 379 to Vatican City.

For this reason, the Vatican Radio has been sued. Television services are provided through another entity, the Vatican Television Center.[135]\n\n\n*L'Osservatore Romano* is the multilingual semi-official newspaper of the Holy See. It is published by a private corporation under the direction of Catholic laymen, but reports on official information. However, the official texts of documents are in the *Acta Apostolicae Sedis*, the official gazette of the Holy See, which has an appendix for documents of the Vatican City State.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe closest metro station is Ottaviano \u2013 San Pietro \u2013 Musei Vaticani.[130]\n\n\n\n### Communications[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Vatican's post office was established on 11 February 1929.\nThe City is served by an independent, modern telephone system named the Vatican Telephone Service,[131] and a postal system (Poste Vaticane) that started operating on 13 February 1929. On 1 August, the state started to release its own postal stamps, under the authority of the Philatelic and Numismatic Office of the Vatican City State.[132] The city's postal service is sometimes said to be \"the best in the world\",[133] and faster than the postal service in Rome.[133]\n\n\nThe Vatican also controls its own Internet top-level domain, which is registered as (.va). Broadband service is widely provided within Vatican City. Vatican City has also been given a radio ITU prefix, HV, and this is sometimes used by amateur radio operators.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nJudicial functions are delegated to a supreme court, an appellate court, a tribunal (Tribunal of Vatican City State), and a trial judge. At the Vatican's request, sentences imposed can be served in Italy (see the section on crime, below).\n\n\nThe international postal country code prefix is *SCV*, and the only postal code is *00120* \u2013 altogether *SCV-00120*.[82]\n\n\n\n### Defence and security[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Military in Vatican City, Pontifical Swiss Guard, Corps of Gendarmerie of Vatican City, and Corps of Firefighters of the Vatican City State\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nVatican City contains religious and cultural sites such as St. Peter's Basilica, the Sistine Chapel, the Vatican Apostolic Library, and the Vatican Museums. They feature some of the world's most famous paintings and sculptures. The unique economy of Vatican City is supported financially by donations from the faithful, by the sale of postage stamps and souvenirs, fees for admission to museums, and sales of publications. Vatican City has no taxes and items are duty-free.\n\n\n\n\n## Name[edit]\n\n\nThe name *Vatican City* was first used in the Lateran Treaty, signed on 11 February 1929, which established the modern city-state named after Vatican Hill, the geographic location of the state within the city of Rome. \"Vatican\" is derived from the name of an Etruscan settlement, *Vatica* or *Vaticum*, located in the general area the Romans called *Ager Vaticanus*, \"Vatican territory\".[25]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t* French: *Cit\u00e9 du Vatican*\u2014*\u00c9tat de la Cit\u00e9 du Vatican*\n\t* German: *Vatikanstadt*, cf. *Vatikan*\u2014*Staat Vatikanstadt* (in Austria: *Staat der Vatikanstadt*)\n\t* Polish: *Miasto Watyka\u0144skie*, cf. *Watykan*\u2014*Pa\u0144stwo Watyka\u0144skie*\n\t* Portuguese: *Cidade do Vaticano*\u2014*Estado da Cidade do Vaticano*\n\t* Spanish: *Ciudad del Vaticano*\u2014*Estado de la Ciudad del Vaticano*.\n9. **^** The Holy See is the central governing body of the Catholic Church and a sovereign entity recognised by international law, consisting of the Pope and the Roman Curia. It is also commonly referred to as \"The Vatican\", especially when used as a metonym for the hierarchy of the Catholic Church.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Italian name of the city is *Citt\u00e0 del Vaticano* or, more formally, *Stato della Citt\u00e0 del Vaticano*, meaning 'Vatican City State'. Its Latin name is **Status Civitatis Vaticanae**;[26][27] this is used in official documents by the Holy See, the Church and the Pope.\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: History of the Papacy and Holy See \u00a7\u00a0History\n\n### Early history[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n8. **^** Nick Megoran (2009) \"Theocracy\" Archived 4 August 2020 at the Wayback Machine, p. 226 in *International Encyclopedia of Human Geography*, vol. 11, Elsevier ISBN\u00a0978-0-08-044911-1\n9. **^** \"Legislative and Executive Bodies\". *Vatican City State*.

It usually ceases upon cessation of the appointment. Citizenship is also extended to the spouse and children of a citizen, provided they are living together in the city.[114] Some individuals are also authorized to reside in the city but do not qualify or choose not to request citizenship.[114] Anyone who loses Vatican citizenship and does not possess other citizenship automatically becomes an Italian citizen as provided in the Lateran Treaty.[55]\n\n\nThe Holy See, not being a country, issues only diplomatic and service passports, whereas Vatican City issues normal passports for its citizens.\n\n\n\n### Statistical oddities[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nUnder the terms of article 22 of the Lateran Treaty,[90] Italy will, at the request of the Holy See, punish individuals for crimes committed within Vatican City and will itself proceed against the person who committed the offence, if that person takes refuge in Italian territory. Persons accused of crimes recognised as such both in Italy and in Vatican City that are committed in Italian territory will be handed over to the Italian authorities if they take refuge in Vatican City or in buildings that enjoy immunity under the treaty.[90][91]\n\n\nVatican City has no prison system, apart from a few detention cells for pre-trial detention.[92] People convicted of committing crimes in the Vatican serve terms in Italian prisons (Polizia Penitenziaria), with costs covered by the Vatican.[93]\n\n\n\n### Foreign relations[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Foreign relations of the Holy See and List of diplomatic missions of the Holy See\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Media | * Holy See Press Office\n\t+ Vatican Information Service\n* Vatican Media\n\t+ Vatican News\n\t+ Vatican Radio\n\t+ Vatican Television Center\n* Vatican News App\n* Vatican Publishing House\n\t+ *Acta Apostolicae Sedis*\n\t+ *Annuario Pontificio*\n* *L'Osservatore Romano*\n* Pope2you\n |\n\n |\n| Religion | * Catholic Church\n |\n| Symbols | * Anthem\n* Coat of arms\n* Flag\n |\n\n |\n| Sports | * Amateur Sports Association\n* Cricket team\n* National football team (Men)\n* National football team (Women)\n* Vatican Athletics\n |\n| * ![flag](image) Vatican City portal\n* ![icon](image) Catholicism portal\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n15. **^** \"La Santa Sede\". *Vatican.va*.

French and Italian are in fact more spoken in the principality today than Mon\u00e9gasque, its historic vernacular language. A dialect of Ligurian, Mon\u00e9gasque is not recognised as an official language; nevertheless, some signage appears in both French and Mon\u00e9gasque, and the language is taught in schools. English is also used.\n\n\nItalian was the official language in Monaco until 1860, when it was replaced by French.[159] This was due to the annexation of the surrounding County of Nice to France following the Treaty of Turin (1860).[159]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFrench (28.4%)\nMon\u00e9gasque (21.6%)\nItalian (18.7%)\nBritish (7.5%)\nBelgian (2.8%)\nGerman (2.5%)\nSwiss (2.5%)\nAmerican (1.2%)\nOther (14.8%)\n\n### Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of Monaco\n\nMonaco's total population was 38,400 in 2015, and estimated by the United Nations to be 36,297 as of 1 July 2023.[154][155] Monaco's population is unusual in that the native Mon\u00e9gasques are a minority in their own country: the largest group are French nationals at 28.4%, followed by Mon\u00e9gasque (21.6%), Italian (18.7%), British (7.5%), Belgian (2.8%), German (2.5%), Swiss (2.5%) and U.S. nationals (1.2%).[156] According to 2019 studies, 31% of Monaco\u2019s population is reported to be millionaires equalling up to 12,248 individuals \n\n\nCitizens of Monaco, whether born in the country or naturalised, are called *Mon\u00e9gasque*. Monaco has the world's highest life expectancy at nearly 90 years.[157][158]\n\n\n\n### Language[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of Monaco\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Grimaldi, princes of Monaco, are of Ligurian origin; thus, the traditional national language is Mon\u00e9gasque, a variety of Ligurian, now spoken by only a minority of residents and as a common second language by many native residents. In Monaco-Ville, street signs are printed in both French and Mon\u00e9gasque.[160][161]\n\n\n\n## Religion[edit]\n\n\nReligion in Monaco according to the *Global Religious Landscape* survey by the Pew Forum, 2012[3]\n\n\n\nChristianity (86%)\nUnaffiliated (11.7%)\nJudaism (1.7%)\nIslam (0.4%)\nOther religions (0.2%)\n\n### Christianity[edit]\n\n\nChristians comprise a total of 86% of Monaco's population.[3]\n\n\nAccording to Monaco 2012 International Religious Freedom Report, Roman Catholic Christians are Monaco's largest religious group, followed by Protestant Christians. The Report states that there are two Protestant churches, an Anglican church and a Reformed church. There are also various other Evangelical Protestant communities that gather periodically.\n\n\n\n#### Catholicism[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Calling code | +377 |\n| ISO 3166 code | MC |\n| Internet TLD | .mc |\n| 1. **^** Government offices are located in the Monaco-Ville quarter.\n2. **^** GDP per capita calculations include non-resident workers from France and Italy.\n3. **^** *Monacan* is the term for residents.\n |\n\n\n**Monaco** (/\u02c8m\u0252n\u0259ko\u028a/ \u24d8 *MON-\u0259-koh*, French: [m\u0254nako]; Mon\u00e9gasque: *M\u00f9negu* [\u02c8mune\u0261u]), officially the **Principality of Monaco**,[a] is a sovereign city-state and microstate on the French Riviera a few kilometres west of the Italian region of Liguria, in Western Europe, on the Mediterranean Sea. It is bordered by France to the north, east and west. The principality is home to 38,682 residents,[11] of whom 9,486 are Mon\u00e9gasque nationals;[12] it is widely recognised as one of the most expensive and wealthiest places in the world.[13][14] The official language of the principality is French. In addition, Mon\u00e9gasque (a dialect of Ligurian), English and Italian are spoken and understood by many residents.[b]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n155. **^** \"Monaco Population 2023 (Live)\".

In 2015 an immigration rate of about 4 people per 1,000 was noted, or about 100\u2013150 people a year.[216] The population of Monaco went from 35,000 in 2008 to 36,000 in 2013, and of that about 20 per cent were native Monegasque[217] (see also Nationality law of Monaco).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n48. **^** \"Monaco \u2013 Principality of Monaco \u2013 Principaut\u00e9 de Monaco \u2013 French Riviera Travel and Tourism\". *Nationsonline.org*.

The nearest airport is also in Italy. The country's capital city, the City of San Marino, is located atop Monte Titano, while its largest settlement is Dogana within the largest municipality of Serravalle.

Another 12,000 Sammarinese live abroad (5,700 in Italy, 3,000 in the US, 1,900 in France and 1,600 in Argentina).\n\n\nThe first census since 1976 was conducted in 2010. Results were expected by the end of 2011; however, 13% of families did not return their forms.\n\n\nThe primary language spoken is Italian; Romagnol is also widely spoken.\n\n\n\n### Notable people[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe *Universit\u00e0 degli Studi della Repubblica di San Marino* (University of the Republic of San Marino)[75] is the main university, which includes the *Scuola Superiore di Studi Storici di San Marino* (Graduate School of Historical Studies), a distinguished research and advanced international study centre governed by an international Scientific Committee coordinated by the emeritus historian Luciano Canfora. Other important institutes are the *Istituto Musicale Sammarinese* (Sammarinese Musical Institute)[76] and the Akademio Internacia de la Sciencoj San Marino or *Accademia Internazionale delle Scienze San Marino* (International Academy of Sciences San Marino).[77] The latter is known for adopting Esperanto as the language for teaching and for scientific publications; further, it makes wide use of electronic educational technology (also called e-learning).\n\n\nItalian author Umberto Eco had attempted to create a \"university without physical structures\" in San Marino.[78]\n\n\n\n### Sport[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n### Public holidays and festivals[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Public holidays in San Marino\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSan Marino has had more female heads of state than any other country: 15 as of October 2014, including three who served twice. With regard to the legal profession, while the Order of Lawyers and Notaries of the Republic of San Marino (*Ordine degli Avvocati e Notai della Repubblica di San Marino*) exists, there is no clear indication as to how demographic groups have fared in the legal field.\n\n\nOn 1 April 2022, 58-year-old Paolo Rondelli was elected as one of the two captains regent, its heads of state. He had previously been the Ambassador to the United States and is the world's first openly gay head of state.[51]\n\n\n\n### Administrative division[edit]\n\n\n#### Municipalities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Administrative divisions of San Marino\nSan Marino is divided into nine municipalities, known locally as **castelli** (meaning \"castles\"):\n\n\n\n* San Marino (City of San Marino, officially **Citt\u00e0 di San Marino**) is the capital.\n\n\nAnd eight minor municipalities:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)San Marino Cathedral\nSan Marino is a predominantly Catholic state,[1] though Catholicism is not an established religion. Over 48.4% of the population profess the Catholic faith, and approximately half of those regularly attend church. There is no episcopal see in San Marino, although its name is part of the present diocesan title. Historically, the various parishes in San Marino were divided between two Italian dioceses, mostly in the Diocese of Montefeltro, and partly in the Diocese of Rimini. In 1977, the border between Montefeltro and Rimini was readjusted so that all of San Marino fell within the diocese of Montefeltro. The bishop of Montefeltro-San Marino resides in Pennabilli, in Italy's province of Pesaro e Urbino. The country's high Roman Catholic majority can mainly be traced back to the country's founding, when Saint Marinus set up the first fortress to protect Christians from Roman persecution.[66] The small state's culture has primarily remained Catholic ever since.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nCountry in Southern Europe enclaved by Italy\nFor other uses, see San Marino (disambiguation).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Republic of San Marino[1][2]\n*Repubblica di San Marino*\u00a0(Italian)\n |\n| --- |\n| ![Flag of San Marino](image)\n\nFlag\n\n![Coat of arms of San Marino](image)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nCoat of arms\n |\n| **Motto:**Libertas\"Freedom\" |\n| **Anthem:**\u00a0Inno Nazionale della Repubblica\"National Anthem of the Republic\"\n |\n| ![Location of San Marino in Europe](image)Location of\u00a0San Marino\u00a0(green)in Europe\u00a0(agate grey)\u00a0 \u2013\u00a0 [Legend]\n |\n| Capital | San Marino43\u00b056\u2032N 12\u00b026\u2032E\ufeff / \ufeff43.933\u00b0N 12.433\u00b0E\ufeff / 43.933; 12.433 |\n| Largest settlement | Dogana43\u00b058\u203253\u2033N 12\u00b029\u203222\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff43.98139\u00b0N 12.48944\u00b0E\ufeff / 43.98139; 12.48944 |\n| Official\u00a0languages | Italian[3] |\n| Other languages | Romagnol |\n| Religion  | 91.5% Christianity5.6% agnosticism1.9% atheism1% other*see Religion in San Marino* |\n| Demonym(s) | Sammarinese |\n| Government | Unitary parliamentary diarchic directorial republic |\n|  |\n| \u2022\u00a0Captains Regent\n | * Filippo Tamagnini\n* Gaetano Troina\n |\n| \u2022\u00a0Secretary for Foreign and Political Affairs\n | Luca Beccari |\n|  |\n| Legislature | Grand and General Council |\n| Independence |\n|  |\n| \u2022\u00a0From the Roman Empire\n | 3 September 301 (traditional) |\n| \u2022\u00a0From the Papal States\n | 1291 |\n| \u2022\u00a0Constitution\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n69. **^** \"San Marino\". *1906 Jewish Encyclopedia*.

The *Gemeinden* mostly consist of only a single town or village. Five of them (Eschen, Gamprin, Mauren, Ruggell, and Schellenberg) fall within the electoral district *Unterland* (the lower county), and the remainder (Balzers, Planken, Schaan, Triesen, Triesenberg, and Vaduz) within *Oberland* (the upper county).\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nDespite its alpine location, the prevailing southerly winds temper Liechtenstein's climate. Its climate is continental, with cloudy and cold winters, with frequent rain and snowfall. Summers are cool to slightly warm, cloudy, and humid.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLiechtenstein is one of only a few countries without an airport. The nearest large airport is Zurich Airport near Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland (130\u00a0km or 80 miles by road). The nearest small airport is St. Gallen Airport (50\u00a0km or 30 miles).

Its population is primarily Alemannic-speaking, although one third is foreign-born, primarily German speakers from Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, along with other Swiss, Italians, and Turks. Foreign-born people make up two-thirds of the country's workforce.[82]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAccording to the 2010 census, 85.8% of the total population were Christian, of whom 75.9% adhered to the Catholic faith, constituted in the Catholic Archdiocese of Vaduz, while 9.6% were either Protestant, mainly organized in the Evangelical Church in Liechtenstein (a United church, Lutheran & Reformed) and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Liechtenstein, or Orthodox, mainly organized in the Christian-Orthodox Church.[87] The largest minority religion is Islam (5.4% of the total population).[88]\n\n\nIn 2020, 72% of the population were Catholic, 10% was Protestant and 6% was Muslim; 5% had no religious beliefs.[89]\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Education in Liechtenstein\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Bev\u00f6lkerungsstatistik 2017 Llv.li, p. 7\n2. **^** \"Central Intelligence Agency\". *The World Factbook*.

It is Europe's fourth-smallest country, with an area of just over 160 square kilometres (62 square miles) and a population of 38,749 (as of 2019[update]).[15] Divided into 11 municipalities, its capital is Vaduz, and its largest municipality is Schaan. It is also the smallest country to border two countries.[16]\n\n\nEconomically, Liechtenstein has one of the highest gross domestic products per person in the world when adjusted for purchasing power parity.[17] The country has a strong financial sector centred in Vaduz. It was once known as a billionaire tax haven, but is no longer on any official blacklists of uncooperative tax haven countries. An Alpine country, Liechtenstein is mountainous, making it a winter sport destination.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nConflicts over the handling of banking and tax data have repeatedly strained relations with Germany. On 2 September 2009, Liechtenstein and Germany signed an agreement on cooperation and the exchange of information in tax matters. The text of the agreement followed the OECD model agreement and provides for an exchange of information on tax matters upon request as of the 2010 tax year. In addition, Liechtenstein regards Germany as an important partner in safeguarding its interests in European integration. At the cultural level, project sponsorship plays a particularly important role. For example, the Hilti Foundation financed the exhibition \"Egypt's Sunken Treasures\" in Berlin, and the state donated 20,000 euros following the fire at the Duchess Anna Amalia Library in Weimar.\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Liechtenstein\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRadio Liechtenstein (de), which was established in 2004 along with the public-service broadcaster *Liechtensteinischer Rundfunk* (LRF) that operates it, is the country's only domestic radio station based in Triesen. Radio Liechtenstein and several programs of the Swiss SRF are broadcast from the Sender Erbi (de) overlooking Vaduz. Liechtenstein also has two major newspapers: *Liechtensteiner Volksblatt* and *Liechtensteiner Vaterland*.\n\n\nAmateur radio is a hobby of some nationals and visitors. However, unlike virtually every other sovereign nation, Liechtenstein does not have its own ITU prefix. Conventionally, amateurs are issued call signs with the Swiss prefix \"HB\", followed by \"0\" or \"L\".\n\n\n\n## Sports[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n78. **^** Removal from OECD List of Unco-operative Tax Havens.

Public schools tend to use both Maltese and English in a balanced manner. Private schools prefer to use English for teaching, as is also the case with most departments of the University of Malta; this has a limiting effect on the capacity and development of the Maltese language.[202] Most university courses are in English.[228][200] The College of Remote and Offshore Medicine based in Malta teaches exclusively in English.\n\n\nOf the total number of pupils studying a first foreign language at secondary level, 51 per cent take Italian whilst 38 per cent take French. Other choices include German, Russian, Spanish, Latin, Chinese and Arabic.[202][229]\n\n\nMalta is also a popular destination to study the English language, attracting over 83,000 students in 2019.[230]\n\n\n\n## Infrastructure[edit]\n\n\n### Transport[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Transport in Malta and Buses in Malta\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe population's age composition is similar to the age structure prevalent in the EU.
