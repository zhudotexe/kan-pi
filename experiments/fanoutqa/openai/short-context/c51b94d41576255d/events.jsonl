Antananarivo is connected to Toamasina, Ambatondrazaka and Antsirabe by rail, and another rail line connects Fianarantsoa to Manakara. The most important seaport in Madagascar is located on the east coast at Toamasina. Ports at Mahajanga and Antsiranana are significantly less used because of their remoteness.[46] Madagascar's government hopes to expand the ports of Antsiranana in the north and Taolagnaro in the south, connecting them to improved road networks, since many imports are every day necessities and Madagascar also relies on export money.**[196]**[198][199] The island's newest port at Ehoala, constructed in 2008 and privately managed by Rio Tinto, will come under state control upon completion of the company's mining project near Tôlanaro around 2038.[190] Air Madagascar services the island's many small regional airports, which offer the only practical means of access to many of the more remote regions during rainy season road washouts.[46]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMadagascar is a member of the United Nations (UN), the African Union (AU), the Southern African Development Community (SADC), and the Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie. Malagasy and French are both official languages of the state. Christianity is the country's predominant religion, with a significant minority still practicing traditional faiths. Madagascar is classified as a least developed country by the UN.[20] Ecotourism and agriculture, paired with greater investments in education, health and private enterprise, are key elements of its development strategy. Despite substantial economic growth since the early 2000s, income disparities have widened, and quality of life remains low for the majority of the population.

Madagascar was not permitted to attend the first African Union summit because of a dispute over the results of the 2001 presidential election, but rejoined the African Union in July 2003 after a 14-month hiatus. Madagascar was again suspended by the African Union in March 2009 following the unconstitutional transfer of executive power to Rajoelina.[154] Madagascar is a member of the International Criminal Court with a Bilateral Immunity Agreement of protection for the United States military.[47] Eleven countries have established embassies in Madagascar, including France, the United Kingdom, the United States, China and India,[155] while Madagascar has embassies in sixteen other countries.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n88. **^** \"All you need to know about high-stakes Madagascar poll\".

No single Malagasy-language name predating *Madagasikara* appears to have been used by the local population to refer to the island, although some communities had their own name for part or all of the land they inhabited.[26]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n45. **^** Razafimahazo, S.

This lower percentage of Indigenous peoples on Baffin Island results from Iqaluit being 59.29 per cent Indigenous and 40.65 per cent non-Indigenous. Of the total population 72.17 per cent are Inuit, 0.92 per cent are First Nations, and 0.73 per cent are Métis.

Bjarni appears to be the first European to see Baffin Island, and the first European to see North America beyond Greenland.[31] It was about 15 years later that the Norse Greenlanders, led by Leif Erikson, a son of Erik the Red, started exploring new areas around the year 1000.[31] Baffin Island is thought to be Helluland, and the archaeological site at Tanfield Valley is thought to have been a trading post.[33][34] The Saga of Erik the Red, 1880 translation into English by J. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Bowman Bay Wildlife Sanctuary is also located on the western side of Baffin Island near Bowman Bay in the Great Plain of the Koukdjuak. It is 1,079 km2 (417 sq mi) and is classified as Category IV (Habitat/Species Management Area) under the International Union for Conservation of Nature.[62][63]\n\n\nBaffin Island has both year-round and summer visitor wildlife. On land, examples of year-round wildlife are barren-ground caribou,[64] polar bear,[65] Arctic fox, red fox, Arctic hare, lemming, and Baffin Island wolf.[66]\n\n\nBarren-ground caribou herds migrate in a limited range from northern Baffin Island down to the southern part in winter, even to the Frobisher Bay peninsula, next to Resolution Island, then migrating back north in the summer.[64] In 2012, a survey of caribou herds found that the local population was only about 5,000, a decrease of as much as 95% from the 1990s.[67]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Barnes Ice Cap, in the middle of the island, has been retreating since at least the early 1960s, when the Geographical Branch of the then Department of Mines and Technical Surveys sent a three-man survey team to the area to measure isostatic rebound and cross-valley features of the Isortoq River.[84] Although in the 1970s parts of Baffin Island failed to have the usual ice-free period in the summer.[85]\n\n\nClimate tables from south to north\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n9. **^** McDermott, James (2001a).

Approximately 30% of the total population resides in the Greater Tokyo Area on the Kantō Plain. As the historical center of Japanese cultural and political power,[12] the island includes several past Japanese capitals, including Kyōto, Nara, and Kamakura. Much of the island's southern shore forms part of the Taiheiyō Belt, a megalopolis that spans several of the Japanese islands.[12] Honshu contains Japan's highest mountain, Mount Fuji, and its largest lake, Lake Biwa.[13]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMountainous and volcanic, Honshu experiences frequent earthquakes (the Great Kantō earthquake heavily damaged Tokyo in September 1923, and the earthquake of March 2011 moved the northeastern part of the island by varying amounts of as much as 5.3 m (17 ft)[18][19] while causing devastating tsunamis). The highest peak is the active volcano Mount Fuji at 3,776 m (12,388 ft), which makes Honshu the world's 7th highest island. There are many rivers, including the Shinano River, Japan's longest. The Japanese Alps span the width of Honshu, from the 'Sea of Japan' coast to the Pacific shore. The climate is generally humid subtropical in western Japan and humid continental in the north.\n\n\n\n### Population[edit]\n\n\nHonshu has a total population of 104 million people, according to a 2017 estimate, 81.3% of the entire population of Japan.[11] The largest city is Tokyo (population: 13,988,129),[20] the capital of Japan and part of the Greater Tokyo Area, the most populous metropolitan area in the world.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Japan as seen from a satellite. Honshu is the largest, middle island.\nThe island is roughly 1,300 km (810 mi) long and ranges from 50 to 230 km (31 to 143 mi) wide, and its total area is 227,960 km2 (88,020 sq mi),[1] making it slightly larger than the island of Great Britain 209,331 km2 (80,823 sq mi).[10] Its land area has been increasing with land reclamation and coastal uplift in the north due to plate tectonics with a convergent boundary. Honshu has 10,084 kilometres (6,266 mi) of coastline.[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMost of Japan's industry is located in a belt running along Honshu's southern coast, from Tokyo to Nagoya, Kyōto, Osaka, Kobe, and Hiroshima;[12] by contrast, the economy along the northwestern Sea of Japan coast is largely based on fishing and agriculture.[14] The island is linked to the other three major Japanese islands by a number of bridges and tunnels. The island primarily shares two climates, with Northern Honshu having a mainly humid continental climate while the south has a humid subtropical climate.[15]\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nThe name of the island, Honshū (本州), directly translates to \"main province\" in English.\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Early history[edit]\n\n\nHumans first arrived in Honshu about 60,000 years ago.

Several coal deposits are located in the northern part of the island,[32] concentrated in Fukushima Prefecture and Niigata Prefecture, though Honshu's coal production is negligible in comparison to Hokkaido and Kyushu.[33] Most of Japan's oil reserves are also located in northern Honshu, along the west coast, spanning Niigata, Yamagata, and Akita Prefectures.[34]\n\n\nMost of Japan's copper, lead, zinc and chromite is located on Honshu, along with smaller, scattered deposits of gold, silver, arsenic, sulfur and pyrite.[35]\n\n\n\n## Transportation[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* ![](image) Aichi Prefecture\n* ![](image) Fukui Prefecture\n* ![](image) Gifu Prefecture\n* ![](image) Ishikawa Prefecture\n* ![](image) Nagano Prefecture\n* ![](image) Niigata Prefecture\n* ![](image) Shizuoka Prefecture\n* ![](image) Toyama Prefecture\n* ![](image) Yamanashi Prefecture\n* ---\n\nKansai\n\n* ![](image) Hyōgo Prefecture\n* ![](image) Kyoto Prefecture\n* ![](image) Mie Prefecture\n* ![](image) Nara Prefecture\n* ![](image) Osaka Prefecture\n* ![](image) Shiga Prefecture\n* ![](image) Wakayama Prefecture\n* ---\n\nChūgoku\n\n* ![](image) Hiroshima Prefecture\n* ![](image) Okayama Prefecture\n* ![](image) Shimane Prefecture\n* ![](image) Tottori Prefecture\n* ![](image) Yamaguchi Prefecture\n* ---\n |\n| Largest settlement | ![](image) Tokyo (pop. 14,043,239) |\n| Demographics |\n| Population | 104,000,000[2] (2017) |\n| Pop. density | 447/km2 (1158/sq mi) |\n| Ethnic groups | Japanese |\n| Additional information |\n| Time zone | * Japan Standard Time (UTC+9)\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFruit, vegetables, grains, rice and cotton make up the main produce grown in Honshu.[26] The Tohoku region, spanning the north-eastern part of the island, is notable for its rice production, with 65% of cultivated land being rice paddy fields – almost a quarter of all paddy fields in Japan.[27] Chiba Prefecture is famous for its peanuts, also being the largest producer in Japan.[28] Rare species of the lichen genus Menegazzia are found only in Honshu.[29]\n\n\n\n### Industry[edit]\n\n\nMost of Japan's tea and silk is from Honshu.[26] Japan's three largest industrial regions are all located on Honshu: the Keihin region, the Hanshin Industrial Region, and the Chūkyō Industrial Area.\n\n\n\n### Minerals and fuels[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n### Extreme points[edit]\n\n\n#### Bridges and tunnels[edit]\n\n\nHonshu is connected to the islands of Hokkaidō, Kyūshū and Shikoku by tunnels and bridges.
