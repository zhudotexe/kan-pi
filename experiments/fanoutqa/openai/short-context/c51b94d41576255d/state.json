The second-longest runway is at Narsarsuaq Airport, a domestic airport with limited international service in south Greenland. All civil aviation matters are handled by the Danish Transport Authority. Most airports, including Nuuk Airport, have short runways and can only be served by special fairly small aircraft on fairly short flights. Kangerlussuaq Airport, which is around 100\u00a0km (62\u00a0mi) inland from the west coast, is the major airport of Greenland and the hub for domestic flights. Intercontinental flights connect mainly to Copenhagen. Travel between international destinations (except Iceland) and any city in Greenland requires a plane change.\n\n\nIcelandair operates flights from Reykjav\u00edk to a number of airports in Greenland, and the company promotes the service as a day-trip option from Iceland for tourists.[148]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** *Nuna asiilasooq* has equal status as a regional anthem but is generally used only in Greenland.[1]\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Greenlandic has been the sole official language of Greenland since 2009.[2][4]\n3. **^** As of 2000: 410,449\u00a0km2 (158,475\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) ice-free; 1,755,637\u00a0km2 (677,855\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) ice-covered.  \nDensity: 0.14/km2 (0.36/sq\u00a0mi) for ice-free areas.\n4. **^** Afro-Eurasia, the Americas, Australia, and Antarctica are all larger than Greenland; but they are generally considered continents, not islands.[15]\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nGreenland\u00a0articles\n |\n| --- |\n| * Greenland is an autonomous constituent country of the Kingdom of Denmark\n |\n| History | * Timeline\n* Paleo-Eskimo\n* Dorset culture\n* Thule people\n* Norse Colonization\n\t+ Eastern Settlement\n\t+ Western Settlement\n\t+ Language\n\t+ *Skr\u00e6ling*\n* Hans Egede\n* Treaty of Kiel\n* Erik the Red's Land\n* Fridtjof Nansen Land\n* World War II\n* Thule accident\n* Home rule\n* Autonomy (self-rule)\n* Cartographic expeditions\n | ![Greenland](image)\n |\n| Geography | \n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * Climate\n\t+ change\n* Fjords\n* Geology\n* Glaciers\n* Ice sheet\n* Islands\n\t+ by area\n* Mountains\n* National park\n* Rivers\n* Straits\n* Towns and villages\n* Wildlife\n |\n\n |\n| Politics | \n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * Administrative divisions\n* Elections\n* Independence movement\n* Foreign relations\n* High Commissioner\n* Parliament\n* Law enforcement\n* LGBT rights\n* Military\n* Political parties\n* Ruling monarchs\n* Political leader\n\t+ Governor (1728\u20131730, 1925\u20131979)\n\t+ Inspector (1782\u20131924)\n\t+ Prime Minister (1979\u2013current)\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* 7.5% Danish\n* 1.1% other Nordic\n* 1.9% Others\n |\n| Religion  | Christianity (Church of Greenland) |\n| Demonym(s) | * Greenlander\n* Greenlandic\n |\n| Government | Devolved government within a parliamentary constitutional monarchy |\n|  |\n| \u2022\u00a0Monarch\n | Margrethe II |\n| \u2022\u00a0High Commissioner\n | Julie Pr\u00e6st Wilche |\n| \u2022\u00a0Premier\n | M\u00fate Bourup Egede |\n| \u2022\u00a0Speaker of the Inatsisartut\n | Mimi Karlsen |\n|  |\n| Legislature | Inatsisartut |\n| National\u00a0representation |\n| \u2022\u00a0Folketing\n | 2 members |\n| Area |\n| \u2022\u00a0Total\n | 2,166,086\u00a0km2 (836,330\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) |\n| \u2022\u00a0Water\u00a0(%)\n | 83.1[c] |\n| Highest\u00a0elevation | 3,700\u00a0m (12,100\u00a0ft) |\n| Population |\n| \u2022\u00a02022 estimate\n | ![Neutral increase](image)56,583[7] (210th) |\n| \u2022\u00a0Density\n | 0.028/km2 (0.1/sq\u00a0mi) |\n| GDP\u00a0(PPP) | 2011\u00a0estimate |\n| \u2022\u00a0Total\n | $1.8 billion[8] |\n| \u2022\u00a0Per capita\n | $37,000 |\n| GDP\u00a0(nominal) | 2019\u00a0estimate |\n| \u2022\u00a0Total\n | $3.0 billion[9] |\n| \u2022\u00a0Per capita\n | $53,000[10] |\n| Gini\u00a0(2015) | ![Steady](image)\u00a033.9[11]medium |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n6. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"The World Factbook \u2013 Central Intelligence Agency\". *cia.gov*.

King Andrianjaka founded Antananarivo as the capital of his Imerina Kingdom around 1610 or 1625 upon the site of a captured Vazimba capital on the hilltop of Analamanga.[44] As Merina dominance expanded over neighboring Malagasy peoples in the early 19th century to establish the Kingdom of Madagascar, Antananarivo became the center of administration for virtually the entire island. In 1896 the French colonizers of Madagascar adopted the Merina capital as their center of colonial administration. The city remained the capital of Madagascar after regaining independence in 1960. In 2017, the capital's population was estimated at 1,391,433 inhabitants.[150] The next largest cities are Antsirabe (500,000), Toamasina (450,000) and Mahajanga (400,000).[47]\n\n\n\n### Politics[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | UTC+3 (not observed[12]) |\n| Date format | dd/mm/yyyy |\n| Driving side | right |\n| Calling code | +261[12] |\n| ISO 3166 code | MG |\n| Internet TLD | .mg |\n\n\n**Madagascar**, officially the **Republic of Madagascar**,[a] is an island country lying off the southeastern coast of Africa.

According to the constitution, executive power is exercised by the government while legislative power is vested in the ministerial cabinet,[146] the Senate and the National Assembly, although in reality these two latter bodies have very little power or legislative role.

Antananarivo is connected to Toamasina, Ambatondrazaka and Antsirabe by rail, and another rail line connects Fianarantsoa to Manakara. The most important seaport in Madagascar is located on the east coast at Toamasina. Ports at Mahajanga and Antsiranana are significantly less used because of their remoteness.[46] Madagascar's government hopes to expand the ports of Antsiranana in the north and Taolagnaro in the south, connecting them to improved road networks, since many imports are every day necessities and Madagascar also relies on export money.**[196]**[198][199] The island's newest port at Ehoala, constructed in 2008 and privately managed by Rio Tinto, will come under state control upon completion of the company's mining project near T\u00f4lanaro around 2038.[190] Air Madagascar services the island's many small regional airports, which offer the only practical means of access to many of the more remote regions during rainy season road washouts.[46]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMadagascar is a member of the United Nations (UN), the African Union (AU), the Southern African Development Community (SADC), and the Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie. Malagasy and French are both official languages of the state. Christianity is the country's predominant religion, with a significant minority still practicing traditional faiths. Madagascar is classified as a least developed country by the UN.[20] Ecotourism and agriculture, paired with greater investments in education, health and private enterprise, are key elements of its development strategy. Despite substantial economic growth since the early 2000s, income disparities have widened, and quality of life remains low for the majority of the population. Madagascar is experiencing an ongoing famine, which experts argue is the first to be caused entirely by climate change.[21]\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIsland country in the Indian Ocean\n\nThis article is about the island nation.

Madagascar was not permitted to attend the first African Union summit because of a dispute over the results of the 2001 presidential election, but rejoined the African Union in July 2003 after a 14-month hiatus. Madagascar was again suspended by the African Union in March 2009 following the unconstitutional transfer of executive power to Rajoelina.[154] Madagascar is a member of the International Criminal Court with a Bilateral Immunity Agreement of protection for the United States military.[47] Eleven countries have established embassies in Madagascar, including France, the United Kingdom, the United States, China and India,[155] while Madagascar has embassies in sixteen other countries.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n88. **^** \"All you need to know about high-stakes Madagascar poll\".

No single Malagasy-language name predating *Madagasikara* appears to have been used by the local population to refer to the island, although some communities had their own name for part or all of the land they inhabited.[26]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n45. **^** Razafimahazo, S.

This name is used for the administrative region the island is part of (Qikiqtaaluk Region), as well as in multiple places in Nunavut and the Northwest Territories,[7] such as some smaller islands: Qikiqtaaluk in Baffin Bay and Qikiqtaaluk in Foxe Basin. Norse explorers referred to it as *Helluland* (\"stone land\").[8] In 1576, English seaman Martin Frobisher made landfall on the island, naming it \"Queen Elizabeth's Foreland\" and Frobisher Bay is named after him.[9] The island is named after English explorer William Baffin, who, in 1616,[10] came across the island while trying to discover the Northwest Passage.[11] It was also formerly known as **James Island**.[12]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs of the 2016 Canadian census the majority, 74.06 per cent, were Indigenous peoples and 25.83 per cent were non-Indigenous. This compares to 88.85 per cent and 14.12 per cent Indigenous and non-Indigenous people for Nunavut as a whole. This lower percentage of Indigenous peoples on Baffin Island results from Iqaluit being 59.29 per cent Indigenous and 40.65 per cent non-Indigenous. Of the total population 72.17 per cent are Inuit, 0.92 per cent are First Nations, and 0.73 per cent are M\u00e9tis. Except for a few First Nations people in Arctic Bay all non-Inuit Indigenous peoples live in Iqaluit.[51][52][53][54][55][56][57]\n\n\n\n![](image)Sea ice off Baffin Island\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBaffin Island has been inhabited for over 3,000 years, first by the pre-Dorset, followed by the Dorset, and then by the Thule people, ancestors of the Inuit, who have lived on the island for the last thousand years.[29][30] In about 986, Erik Thorvaldsson, known as Erik the Red,[31] formed three settlements near the southwestern tip of Greenland.[32] In late 985 or 986, Bjarni Herj\u00f3lfsson, sailing from Iceland to Greenland, was blown off course and sighted land southwest of Greenland. Bjarni appears to be the first European to see Baffin Island, and the first European to see North America beyond Greenland.[31] It was about 15 years later that the Norse Greenlanders, led by Leif Erikson, a son of Erik the Red, started exploring new areas around the year 1000.[31] Baffin Island is thought to be Helluland, and the archaeological site at Tanfield Valley is thought to have been a trading post.[33][34] The Saga of Erik the Red, 1880 translation into English by J. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Bowman Bay Wildlife Sanctuary is also located on the western side of Baffin Island near Bowman Bay in the Great Plain of the Koukdjuak. It is 1,079\u00a0km2 (417\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) and is classified as Category IV (Habitat/Species Management Area) under the International Union for Conservation of Nature.[62][63]\n\n\nBaffin Island has both year-round and summer visitor wildlife. On land, examples of year-round wildlife are barren-ground caribou,[64] polar bear,[65] Arctic fox, red fox, Arctic hare, lemming, and Baffin Island wolf.[66]\n\n\nBarren-ground caribou herds migrate in a limited range from northern Baffin Island down to the southern part in winter, even to the Frobisher Bay peninsula, next to Resolution Island, then migrating back north in the summer.[64] In 2012, a survey of caribou herds found that the local population was only about 5,000, a decrease of as much as 95% from the 1990s.[67]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Barnes Ice Cap, in the middle of the island, has been retreating since at least the early 1960s, when the Geographical Branch of the then Department of Mines and Technical Surveys sent a three-man survey team to the area to measure isostatic rebound and cross-valley features of the Isortoq River.[84] Although in the 1970s parts of Baffin Island failed to have the usual ice-free period in the summer.[85]\n\n\nClimate tables from south to north\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n9. **^** McDermott, James (2001a).

The highest peak is Mount Odin, with an elevation of at least 2,143\u00a0m (7,031\u00a0ft), although some sources say 2,147\u00a0m (7,044\u00a0ft).[22][23] Another peak of note is Mount Asgard, located in Auyuittuq National Park, with an elevation of 2,011\u00a0m (6,598\u00a0ft). Mount Thor, with an elevation of 1,675\u00a0m (5,495\u00a0ft), is said to have the greatest purely vertical drop (a sheer cliff face) of any mountain on Earth, at 1,250\u00a0m (4,100\u00a0ft).[24] Mount Sharat,[25] with an elevation of 422\u00a0m (1,385\u00a0ft) and a prominence of 67\u00a0m (220\u00a0ft) is located on Baffin Island. The mountain is named after geologist Sharat Kumar Roy, the chief geology curator in the Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago. Roy, a native of India, studied in India, London, and earned his Ph.D. at the University of Chicago. Shortly after he started at the Field Museum he joined the 1927\u20131928 Rawson-Macmillan Expedition to Baffin Island and Labrador. \n</fragment>\n</document>",

Approximately 30% of the total population resides in the Greater Tokyo Area on the Kant\u014d Plain. As the historical center of Japanese cultural and political power,[12] the island includes several past Japanese capitals, including Ky\u014dto, Nara, and Kamakura. Much of the island's southern shore forms part of the Taiheiy\u014d Belt, a megalopolis that spans several of the Japanese islands.[12] Honshu contains Japan's highest mountain, Mount Fuji, and its largest lake, Lake Biwa.[13]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMountainous and volcanic, Honshu experiences frequent earthquakes (the Great Kant\u014d earthquake heavily damaged Tokyo in September 1923, and the earthquake of March 2011 moved the northeastern part of the island by varying amounts of as much as 5.3\u00a0m (17\u00a0ft)[18][19] while causing devastating tsunamis). The highest peak is the active volcano Mount Fuji at 3,776\u00a0m (12,388\u00a0ft), which makes Honshu the world's 7th highest island. There are many rivers, including the Shinano River, Japan's longest. The Japanese Alps span the width of Honshu, from the 'Sea of Japan' coast to the Pacific shore. The climate is generally humid subtropical in western Japan and humid continental in the north.\n\n\n\n### Population[edit]\n\n\nHonshu has a total population of 104 million people, according to a 2017 estimate, 81.3% of the entire population of Japan.[11] The largest city is Tokyo (population: 13,988,129),[20] the capital of Japan and part of the Greater Tokyo Area, the most populous metropolitan area in the world.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Japan as seen from a satellite. Honshu is the largest, middle island.\nThe island is roughly 1,300\u00a0km (810\u00a0mi) long and ranges from 50 to 230\u00a0km (31 to 143\u00a0mi) wide, and its total area is 227,960\u00a0km2 (88,020\u00a0sq\u00a0mi),[1] making it slightly larger than the island of Great Britain 209,331\u00a0km2 (80,823\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).[10] Its land area has been increasing with land reclamation and coastal uplift in the north due to plate tectonics with a convergent boundary. Honshu has 10,084 kilometres (6,266\u00a0mi) of coastline.[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMost of Japan's industry is located in a belt running along Honshu's southern coast, from Tokyo to Nagoya, Ky\u014dto, Osaka, Kobe, and Hiroshima;[12] by contrast, the economy along the northwestern Sea of Japan coast is largely based on fishing and agriculture.[14] The island is linked to the other three major Japanese islands by a number of bridges and tunnels. The island primarily shares two climates, with Northern Honshu having a mainly humid continental climate while the south has a humid subtropical climate.[15]\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nThe name of the island, Honsh\u016b (\u672c\u5dde), directly translates to \"main province\" in English.\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Early history[edit]\n\n\nHumans first arrived in Honshu about 60,000 years ago.

The first air raid to strike Honshu and the other home islands was the Doolittle Raid. With the introduction of the Boeing B-29 Superfortress, the firebombing of Tokyo culminated in Operation Meetinghouse, the most destructive air raid in human history, which destroyed 16 square miles (41\u00a0km2; 10,000 acres) of central Tokyo, leaving an estimated 100,000 civilians dead, and over one million homeless.[17] The war ended with the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki shortly before Japan's surrender and signing of the Japanese Instrument of Surrender on September 2, 1945, on board the USS\u00a0*Missouri*\u00a0(BB-63) in Tokyo Bay.\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* **T\u014dhoku region** consists of six prefectures.\n\t+ ![](image)\u00a0Akita Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image)\u00a0Aomori Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image)\u00a0Fukushima Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image)\u00a0Iwate Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image)\u00a0Miyagi Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image)\u00a0Yamagata Prefecture\n* **Kant\u014d region** consists of seven prefectures, including the capital of Japan which is the Tokyo Metropolis.\n\t+ ![](image)\u00a0Chiba Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image)\u00a0Gunma Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image)\u00a0Ibaraki Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image)\u00a0Kanagawa Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image)\u00a0Saitama Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image)\u00a0Tochigi Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image)\u00a0Tokyo\n* **Ch\u016bbu region** consists of nine prefectures.\n\t+ ![](image)\u00a0Aichi Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image)\u00a0Fukui Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image)\u00a0Gifu Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image)\u00a0Ishikawa Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image)\u00a0Nagano Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image)\u00a0Niigata Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image)\u00a0Shizuoka Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image)\u00a0Toyama Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image)\u00a0Yamanashi Prefecture\n* **Kansai region** consists of seven prefectures.\n\t+ ![](image)\u00a0Hy\u014dgo Prefecture\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
