During the last decade of his tenure, the endowment earned an annualized return of 15.9%.[7] In part after compensation disagreements, a number of HMC managers including Meyer himself left to form their own investment management firms. Bloomberg in 2011 reviewed a group of the resultant firms\u2014Adage Capital Management LP, Charlesbank Capital Partners LLC, Convexity Capital Management LP (Meyer's), Highfields Capital Management LP and Regiment Capital Advisors LLC\u2014which at that time between them managed $43 billion in assets.[8]\n\n\nThe university hired Mohamed El-Erian to succeed Meyer as HMC's next president and CEO.

Critics note that the tax could threaten financial aid for low-income students, stifle social mobility, and obstruct life-saving research.[6][7][8] Lobbyists representing wealthy private universities continue to advocate for its repeal.[9][10] The Don't Tax Higher Education Act, which would repeal the endowment tax, was introduced in the 115th United States Congress,[11] 116th United States Congress,[12] and 117th United States Congress[13] but died in the Ways and Means Committee each time.\n\n\n\n## Endowments greater than $1\u00a0billion[edit]\n\n\n### Private schools[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Yale University has the second-largest endowment of all private colleges and universities in the United States.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n## Enhancements and levies[edit]\n\n\nThe tabulated data below are from NACUBO. Some universities benefit from endowments that are not under their direct control but which are nonetheless dedicated to the welfare of one or several institutions. Examples of these foundations include The Duke Endowment, the Robert A. Welch Foundation, and the Roy J. Carver Charitable Trust.\n\n\nIn 2017, a federal endowment tax was enacted in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 in the form of an excise tax of 1.4% on institutions that have at least 500 tuition-paying students and net assets of at least $500,000 per student. The $500,000 is not adjusted for inflation, so the threshold is effectively lowered over time.[4][5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Institution | State | Endowment[3](billions USD - FY2022) |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| University of Texas System | Texas | $42.668\n |\n| Texas A&M University System[b] | Texas | $18.243\n |\n| University of Michigan | Michigan | $17.347\n |\n| University of California System[c] | California | $15.418\n |\n| University of Virginia | Virginia | $9.858\n |\n| Ohio State University | Ohio | $6.961\n |\n| University of Pittsburgh | Pennsylvania | $5.529\n |\n| University of Minnesota[d] | Minnesota | $5.366\n |\n| University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill[d] | North Carolina | $5.318\n |\n| University of Washington | Washington | $4.678\n |\n| Pennsylvania State University | Pennsylvania | $4.608\n |\n| Michigan State University | Michigan | $3.880\n |\n| Purdue University System | Indiana | $3.676\n |\n| University of California, Los Angeles | California | $3.561\n |\n| Indiana University System | Indiana | $3.515\n |\n| University of Wisconsin-Madison | Wisconsin | $3.497\n |\n| University of Illinois System[d] | Illinois | $3.115\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Institution\n | Enrollment[14](FTE - Fall 2021) | Endowment per student[14](USD - FY2022) |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Rockefeller University | 73 | $35,728,990\n |\n| Princeton Theological Seminary | 326 | $4,310,071\n |\n| Princeton University | 8,799 | $4,067,983\n |\n| Yale University | 14,429 | $2,868,064\n |\n| Stanford University | 16,963 | $2,139,952\n |\n| Massachusetts Institute of Technology | 11,836 | $2,090,222\n |\n| Harvard University | 24,555 | $2,013,622\n |\n| Amherst College | 1,971 | $1,685,364\n |\n| Swarthmore College | 1,651 | $1,650,659\n |\n| Williams College | 2,198 | $1,607,993\n |\n| Pomona College | 1,759 | $1,563,312\n |\n| Columbia Theological Seminary | 168 | $1,561,400\n |\n| California Institute of Technology | 2,397 | $1,516,479\n |\n| Grinnell College | 1,728 | $1,437,742\n |\n| University of Notre Dame | 12,946 | $1,292,237\n |\n| Bowdoin College | 1,949 | $1,269,647\n |\n| Austin Presbyterian Theological Seminary | 114 | $1,247,470\n |\n| Principia College | 687 | $1,244,955\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n12. **^** \"H.R.4438 - Don't Tax Higher Education Act\". *Congress.gov*.

Established in 1861, MIT has played a significant role in the development of many areas of modern technology and science.\n\n\nFounded in response to the increasing industrialization of the United States, MIT adopted a European polytechnic university model and stressed laboratory instruction in applied science and engineering. MIT is one of three private land grant universities in the United States, the others being Cornell University and Tuskegee University. The institute has an urban campus that extends more than a mile (1.6\u00a0km) alongside the Charles River, and encompasses a number of major off-campus facilities such as the MIT Lincoln Laboratory, the Bates Center, and the Haystack Observatory, as well as affiliated laboratories such as the Broad and Whitehead Institutes.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMIT has been nominally co-educational since admitting Ellen Swallow Richards in 1870. Richards also became the first female member of MIT's faculty, specializing in sanitary chemistry.[389][390] Female students remained a small minority prior to the completion of the first wing of a women's dormitory, McCormick Hall, in 1963.[391][392][393] Between 1993 and 2009 the proportion of women rose from 34 percent to 45 percent of undergraduates and from 20 percent to 31 percent of graduate students.[184][394] As of 2009[update], women outnumbered men in Biology, Brain & Cognitive Sciences, Architecture, Urban Planning, and Biological Engineering.[184][395]\n\n\n\n### Faculty and staff[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of Massachusetts Institute of Technology faculty and List of Nobel laureates affiliated with Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n13. **^** \"Statistics\". *www.marshallscholarship.org*.

IBM will spend $240 million over the next decade, and the lab will be staffed by MIT and IBM scientists.[103] In October 2018 MIT announced that it would open a new Schwarzman College of Computing dedicated to the study of artificial intelligence, named after lead donor and The Blackstone Group CEO Stephen Schwarzman. The focus of the new college is to study not just AI, but interdisciplinary AI education, and how AI can be used in fields as diverse as history and biology. The cost of buildings and new faculty for the new college is expected to be $1 billion upon completion.[104]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
