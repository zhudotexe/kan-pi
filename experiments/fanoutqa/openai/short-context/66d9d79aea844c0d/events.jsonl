The route starts at the parking lot for Taos Ski Valley, and proceeds east along an old road to a broad saddle at Bull-of-the-Woods Meadow. It then turns south and winds its way among minor peaks and small valleys to gain Wheeler Peak from the north, going over the summit of Mount Walter along the way. This is a practical route, even in winter, due to low (but nonzero) avalanche exposure.\n\n\nAn alternate route is to hike south from Taos Ski Valley to Williams Lake, then take a newly constructed switchback trail to the top. This trail was completed in 2011 by a Forest Service trail crew from the Gallatin National Forest, 8 people working 12 hours per day, building 4 miles of new trail with hand tools to the top in 14 days. \n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_GyEBLrDLgdsMDtGgYkB8JPzY","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

In 1871, King returned to climb what he believed to be Whitney, but having taken a different approach, he actually summited nearby Mount Langley. Upon learning of his mistake in 1873, King finally completed his own first ascent of Whitney, but did so a month too late to be first.[24] On August 18, 1873, Charles Begole, A. H. Johnson, and John Lucas, all of nearby Lone Pine, had become the first to reach the contiguous United States' highest summit. As they climbed the mountain during a fishing trip to nearby Kern Canyon, they called the mountain Fisherman's Peak.[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHighest mountain in California, United States\n\nThis article is about the mountain. For the former town with this name, see Lone Pine Station, California. For the ship, see USS Mount Whitney (LCC-20).\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe mountain is the highest point on the Great Basin Divide. Waterways on the peak's west side flow into Whitney Creek, which flows into the Kern River. The Kern River terminates at Bakersfield in the Tulare Basin, the southern part of the San Joaquin Valley. Today, the water in the Tulare Basin is largely diverted for agriculture. Historically, during very wet years, water overflowed from the Tulare Basin into the San Joaquin River, which flows to the Pacific Ocean.\n\n\nFrom the east, water from Mount Whitney flows to Lone Pine Creek, where most of the water is diverted into the Los Angeles Aqueduct via a sluice. Some water in the creek is allowed to continue on its natural course, joining the Owens River, which terminates at Owens Lake, an endorheic lake of the Great Basin.\n\n\n\n### Elevation measurements[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nThe 126 highest major summits of greater North America\n |\n| --- |\n| 1.

The peak was commonly said to be at 14,494 ft (4,418 m) and this is the elevation stamped on the USGS brass benchmark disk on the summit. An older plaque on the summit (sheet metal with black lettering on white enamel) reads \"elevation 14,496.811 feet\", but this was estimated using the older vertical datum (NGVD29) from 1929. Since then the shape of the Earth (the geoid) has been estimated more accurately. Using a new vertical datum established in 1988 (NAVD88) the benchmark is now estimated to be 14,505 ft (4,421 m).[1][16]\n\n\n\n## Geology[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n- Junipero Serra Peak\n\n- Mount Baker\n\n- Mount Marcy\n\n- Mount Raoul Blanchard\n\n- Mount Marcus Baker\n\n- Mount Hayes\n\n- Sacajawea Peak\n\n- Steens Mountain\n\n- Mount Fairweather\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Communities | * Angels Camp\n* Auburn\n* Bridgeport\n* Chester\n* Colfax\n* Grass Valley\n* Incline Village\n* Jackson\n* Kernville\n* Loyalton\n* Mammoth Lakes\n* Mariposa\n* Markleeville\n* Nevada City\n* Oakhurst\n* Paradise\n* Placerville\n* Portola\n* Quincy\n* San Andreas\n* Sonora\n* South Lake Tahoe\n* Susanville\n* Sutter Creek\n* Tahoe City\n* Tehachapi\n* Truckee\n |\n| Ski areas | * Alpine Meadows\n* Badger Pass\n* Bear Valley\n* Boreal\n* China Peak\n* Dodge Ridge\n* Donner Ski Ranch\n* Heavenly\n* Homewood\n* June Mountain\n* Kirkwood\n* Mammoth Mountain\n* Northstar\n* Sierra at Tahoe\n* Palisades Tahoe\n* Sugar Bowl\n* Tahoe Donner\n |\n| Trails | * High Sierra Trail\n* John Muir Trail\n* Pacific Crest Trail\n* Sierra High Route\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n- Barbeau Peak\n\n- San Jacinto Peak\n\n- San Gorgonio Mountain\n\n- Charleston Peak\n\n- Pavlof Volcano\n\n- Mount Veniaminof\n\n- Mount Adams\n\n- Skihist Mountain\n\n- Mount Hubbard\n\n- Mount Ratz\n\n- Mount Odin\n\n- Mount Isto\n\n- Mount Monashee\n\n- Iliamna Volcano\n\n- Mount Olympus\n\n- Mount Columbia\n\n- Mount Queen Bess\n\n- Mount Cook\n\n- Mount Hood\n\n- Mount Sanford\n\n- Mount Tom White\n\n- Mount Cooper\n\n- Wheeler Peak\n\n- Ulysses Mountain\n\n- Glacier Peak\n\n- Mount Kimball\n\n- Blue Mountain Peak\n\n- Wedge Mountain\n\n- Otter Mountain\n\n- Mount Griggs\n\n- Nevado de Toluca\n\n- Kwatna Peak\n\n- Outlook Peak\n\n- Mount Foraker\n\n- Golden Hinde\n\n- White Mountain Peak\n\n- Mount Crillon\n\n- Stauning Alper\n\n- Cerro Teotepec\n\n- Scud Peak\n\n- Keele Peak\n\n- Cloud Peak\n\n- Gannett Peak\n\n- Razorback Mountain\n\n- Mount Vsevidof\n\n- Mount Odin\n\n- Cerro el Nacimiento\n\n- Mount Hesperus\n\n- Picacho del Diablo\n\n- Mount Farnham\n\n- Palup Qaqa HP\n\n- Mount Bona\n\n- Oscar Peak\n\n- Pic Macaya\n\n- Montaña de Santa Bárbara\n\n- Mount Assiniboine\n\n- Mount Jancowski\n\n- Cerro Las Minas\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_TIkuwuiW8BcE3SKVYPUiO4Gw","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
