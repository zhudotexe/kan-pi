The Pacific Plate is seismically active beneath Denali, a tectonic region that is known as the \"McKinley cluster\".[14]\n\n\nDenali has a summit elevation of 20,310 feet (6,190\u00a0m) above sea level, making it the highest peak in North America and the northernmost mountain above 19,685 feet (6,000\u00a0m) elevation in the world.[1] Measured from base to peak at some 18,000\u00a0ft (5,500\u00a0m), it is among the largest mountains situated entirely above sea level. Denali rises from a sloping plain with elevations from 1,000 to 3,000\u00a0ft (300 to 910\u00a0m), for a base-to-peak height of 17,000 to 19,000\u00a0ft (5,000 to 6,000\u00a0m).[15]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Walter Harper\n* Robert Tatum\n |\n| Easiest route | West Buttress Route (glacier/snow climb) |\n\n\n**Denali** (/d\u0259\u02c8n\u0251\u02d0li/;[5][6] also known as **Mount McKinley**, its former official name)[7] is the highest mountain peak in North America, with a summit elevation of 20,310 feet (6,190\u00a0m) above sea level.

This weather station was designed to transmit data in real-time for use by the climbing public and the science community. Since its establishment, annual upgrades to the equipment have been performed with instrumentation custom built for the extreme weather and altitude conditions. This weather station is the third-highest weather station in the world.[101]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBy comparison, Mount Everest rises from the Tibetan Plateau at a much higher base elevation. Base elevations for Everest range from 13,800\u00a0ft (4,200\u00a0m) on the south side to 17,100\u00a0ft (5,200\u00a0m) on the Tibetan Plateau, for a base-to-peak height in the range of 12,000 to 15,300\u00a0ft (3,700 to 4,700\u00a0m).[16] Denali's base-to-peak height is little more than half the 33,500\u00a0ft (10,200\u00a0m) of the volcano Mauna Kea, which lies mostly under water.[17]\n\n\n\n### Geography of the mountain[edit]\n\n\nDenali has two significant summits: the South Summit is the higher one, while the North Summit has an elevation of 19,470\u00a0ft (5,934\u00a0m)[12] and a prominence of approximately 1,270\u00a0ft (387\u00a0m).[18] The North Summit is sometimes counted as a separate peak (see e.g., fourteener) and sometimes not; it is rarely climbed, except by those doing routes on the north side of the massif.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n7. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Mr. Wyden, from the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources (September 10, 2013). \"Senate Report 113-93 \u2013 Designation of Denali in the State of Alaska\".

In 1906, Frederick Cook claimed the first ascent, but this ascent is unverified and its legitimacy questioned. The first verifiable ascent to Denali's summit was achieved on June 7, 1913, by climbers Hudson Stuck, Harry Karstens, Walter Harper, and Robert Tatum, who went by the South Summit. In 1951, Bradford Washburn pioneered the West Buttress route, considered to be the safest and easiest route, and therefore the most popular currently in use.[11]\n\n\nOn September 2, 2015, the U.S. Geological Survey announced that the mountain is 20,310 feet (6,190\u00a0m) high,[1] not 20,320 feet (6,194\u00a0m), as measured in 1952 using photogrammetry.\n\n\n\n\n## Geology and features[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWilliam Dickey, a New Hampshire-born resident of Seattle, Washington who had been digging for gold in the sands of the Susitna River, wrote, after his returning from Alaska, an account in the *New York Sun* that appeared on January 24, 1897.[42] His report drew attention with the sentence \"We have no doubt that this peak is the highest in North America, and estimate that it is over 20,000 feet (6,100\u00a0m) high.\" Until then, Mount Logan in Canada's Yukon Territory was believed to be the continent's highest point. Though later praised for his estimate, Dickey admitted that other prospector parties had also guessed the mountain to be over 20,000 feet (6,100\u00a0m).[43] These estimates were confirmed in 1898 by the surveyor Robert Muldrow, who measured its elevation as 20,300 feet (6,200\u00a0m).[44]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

In 1871, King returned to climb what he believed to be Whitney, but having taken a different approach, he actually summited nearby Mount Langley. Upon learning of his mistake in 1873, King finally completed his own first ascent of Whitney, but did so a month too late to be first.[24] On August 18, 1873, Charles Begole, A. H. Johnson, and John Lucas, all of nearby Lone Pine, had become the first to reach the contiguous United States' highest summit. As they climbed the mountain during a fishing trip to nearby Kern Canyon, they called the mountain Fisherman's Peak.[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHighest mountain in California, United States\n\nThis article is about the mountain. For the former town with this name, see Lone Pine Station, California. For the ship, see USS Mount Whitney (LCC-20).\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe mountain is the highest point on the Great Basin Divide. Waterways on the peak's west side flow into Whitney Creek, which flows into the Kern River. The Kern River terminates at Bakersfield in the Tulare Basin, the southern part of the San Joaquin Valley. Today, the water in the Tulare Basin is largely diverted for agriculture. Historically, during very wet years, water overflowed from the Tulare Basin into the San Joaquin River, which flows to the Pacific Ocean.\n\n\nFrom the east, water from Mount Whitney flows to Lone Pine Creek, where most of the water is diverted into the Los Angeles Aqueduct via a sluice. Some water in the creek is allowed to continue on its natural course, joining the Owens River, which terminates at Owens Lake, an endorheic lake of the Great Basin.\n\n\n\n### Elevation measurements[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nThe 126 highest major summits of greater North America\n |\n| --- |\n| 1.

The technology of elevation measurement has become more refined and, more importantly, the vertical coordinate system has changed. The peak was commonly said to be at 14,494\u00a0ft (4,418\u00a0m) and this is the elevation stamped on the USGS brass benchmark disk on the summit. An older plaque on the summit (sheet metal with black lettering on white enamel) reads \"elevation 14,496.811 feet\", but this was estimated using the older vertical datum (NGVD29) from 1929. Since then the shape of the Earth (the geoid) has been estimated more accurately. Using a new vertical datum established in 1988 (NAVD88) the benchmark is now estimated to be 14,505\u00a0ft (4,421\u00a0m).[1][16]\n\n\n\n## Geology[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n- Junipero Serra Peak\n\n- Mount Baker\n\n- Mount Marcy\n\n- Mount Raoul Blanchard\n\n- Mount Marcus Baker\n\n- Mount Hayes\n\n- Sacajawea Peak\n\n- Steens Mountain\n\n- Mount Fairweather\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Communities | * Angels Camp\n* Auburn\n* Bridgeport\n* Chester\n* Colfax\n* Grass Valley\n* Incline Village\n* Jackson\n* Kernville\n* Loyalton\n* Mammoth Lakes\n* Mariposa\n* Markleeville\n* Nevada City\n* Oakhurst\n* Paradise\n* Placerville\n* Portola\n* Quincy\n* San Andreas\n* Sonora\n* South Lake Tahoe\n* Susanville\n* Sutter Creek\n* Tahoe City\n* Tehachapi\n* Truckee\n |\n| Ski areas | * Alpine Meadows\n* Badger Pass\n* Bear Valley\n* Boreal\n* China Peak\n* Dodge Ridge\n* Donner Ski Ranch\n* Heavenly\n* Homewood\n* June Mountain\n* Kirkwood\n* Mammoth Mountain\n* Northstar\n* Sierra at Tahoe\n* Palisades Tahoe\n* Sugar Bowl\n* Tahoe Donner\n |\n| Trails | * High Sierra Trail\n* John Muir Trail\n* Pacific Crest Trail\n* Sierra High Route\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n- Barbeau Peak\n\n- San Jacinto Peak\n\n- San Gorgonio Mountain\n\n- Charleston Peak\n\n- Pavlof Volcano\n\n- Mount Veniaminof\n\n- Mount Adams\n\n- Skihist Mountain\n\n- Mount Hubbard\n\n- Mount Ratz\n\n- Mount Odin\n\n- Mount Isto\n\n- Mount Monashee\n\n- Iliamna Volcano\n\n- Mount Olympus\n\n- Mount Columbia\n\n- Mount Queen Bess\n\n- Mount Cook\n\n- Mount Hood\n\n- Mount Sanford\n\n- Mount Tom White\n\n- Mount Cooper\n\n- Wheeler Peak\n\n- Ulysses Mountain\n\n- Glacier Peak\n\n- Mount Kimball\n\n- Blue Mountain Peak\n\n- Wedge Mountain\n\n- Otter Mountain\n\n- Mount Griggs\n\n- Nevado de Toluca\n\n- Kwatna Peak\n\n- Outlook Peak\n\n- Mount Foraker\n\n- Golden Hinde\n\n- White Mountain Peak\n\n- Mount Crillon\n\n- Stauning Alper\n\n- Cerro Teotepec\n\n- Scud Peak\n\n- Keele Peak\n\n- Cloud Peak\n\n- Gannett Peak\n\n- Razorback Mountain\n\n- Mount Vsevidof\n\n- Mount Odin\n\n- Cerro el Nacimiento\n\n- Mount Hesperus\n\n- Picacho del Diablo\n\n- Mount Farnham\n\n- Palup Qaqa HP\n\n- Mount Bona\n\n- Oscar Peak\n\n- Pic Macaya\n\n- Monta\u00f1a de Santa B\u00e1rbara\n\n- Mount Assiniboine\n\n- Mount Jancowski\n\n- Cerro Las Minas\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

It is located northeast of Taos and south of Red River in the northern part of the state, and just 2 miles (3.2\u00a0km) southeast of the ski slopes of Taos Ski Valley. It lies in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, the southernmost subrange of the Rocky Mountains. The peak's elevation is 13,167 feet (4,013\u00a0m).\n\n\nFormerly named Taos Peak, after the nearby town of Taos, New Mexico, it was renamed Wheeler Peak in 1950.[3] A plaque at the summit states that the mountain was:\n\n\n\n\n> Named in honor of Major George Montague Wheeler (1832\u20131909) who for ten years led a party of surveyors and naturalists collecting geologic, biologic, planimetric and topographic data in New Mexico and six other southwestern states.\n> \n> \n\n\n\n## Nearby peaks and features[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMountain\n\nFor other summits, see Wheeler Peak.\n\n\n\n| Wheeler Peak |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)Wheeler Peak\n |\n| Highest\u00a0point |\n| Elevation | 13,167\u00a0ft (4,013\u00a0m)\u00a0NAVD\u00a088[1] |\n| Prominence | 3,409\u00a0ft (1,039\u00a0m)[2] |\n| Parent peak | Vermejo Peak |\n| Listing | * North America highest peaks 119th\n* US highest major peaks 98th\n* U.S. state high point 8th\n |\n| Coordinates | 36\u00b033\u203225\u2033N 105\u00b025\u203201\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff36.556855136\u00b0N 105.416947028\u00b0W\ufeff / 36.556855136; -105.416947028[1] |\n| Geography |\n| ![Wheeler Peak is located in New Mexico](image)![Wheeler Peak](image)\nWheeler Peak\n |\n| Location | Taos County, New Mexico, U.S. |\n| Parent range | Taos Mountains |\n| Topo map | USGS Wheeler Peak |\n| Climbing |\n| Easiest route | Williams Lake |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nMountains of New Mexico\n |\n| --- |\n| Big Burro Mountains | * Soldiers Farewell Hill\n |\n| Big Hatchet Mountains | * Big Hatchet Peak\n* Zeller Peak\n |\n| Black Range | * Black Mountain (Catron County)\n* McKnight Mountain\n |\n| Chuska Mountains | * Beautiful Mountain\n |\n| Cookes Range | * Massacre Peak\n |\n| Fra Cristobal Range | * Fra Cristoblal Mountain\n |\n| Jemez Mountains | * Cerro Grande\n* Chicoma Mountain\n* Redondo Peak\n |\n| Magdalena Mountains | * South Baldy\n |\n| Mogollon Mountains | * Mogollon Baldy\n* Whitewater Baldy\n |\n| Organ Mountains | * Organ Needle\n |\n| Oscura Mountains | * Oscura Peak\n* North Oscura Peak\n |\n| Peloncillo Mountains | * Steins Peak\n |\n| Pyramid Mountains | * Pyramid Peak\n |\n| Raton-Clayton Volcanic Field | * Capulin Volcano\n* Sierra Grande\n |\n| Sacramento Mountains | * Cathey Peak\n |\n| San Andres Mountains | * Salinas Peak\n* San Augustin Mountains\n |\n| San Mateo Mountains(Cibola County) | * Mount Taylor\n* West Blue Mountain\n |\n| Sandia\u2013Manzano Mountains | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Manzano Mountains | * Manzano Peak\n |\n| Sandia Mountains | * Sandia Crest\n |\n\n |\n| Sangre de Cristo Mountains | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Cimarron Range | * Baldy Mountain (Colfax County)\n* Mount Phillips\n |\n| Taos Mountains | * Gold Hill\n* Ute Mountain\n* Vallecito Mountain\n* Venado Peak\n* Wheeler Peak\n |\n| Others | * Baldy Mountain (Taos County)\n* Hermit Peak\n* Santa Fe Baldy\n* Truchas Peak\n* Mount Walter\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nState of New Mexico\n |\n| --- |\n| **Santa Fe** (capital)\n |\n| Topics | * Index\n* Census-designated places\n* Cuisine\n\t+ Bizcochito\n\t+ Chile\n* Culture\n* Delegations\n* Geography\n* Government\n* History\n\t+ Nuevo M\u00e9xico\n\t+ Territory\n* Landmarks\n* Military\n\t+ National Guard\n\t+ Civil War\n\t+ World War II\n* Music\n\t+ New Mexico music\n* New Mexicans\n\t+ Hispanos\n\t+ Pueblos and Tribes\n* Paleontology\n* Symbols\n* Tourist attractions\n* Transportation\n |\n| Society | * Abortion\n* Climate change\n* Crime\n* Demographics\n* Economy\n* Education\n* Elections\n* Gun laws\n* Homelessness\n* LGBT rights\n* Literature\n* Politics\n |\n| Regions | * Apachian zone\n* Central New Mexico\n* Chicoma Mountain\n* Chihuahuan Desert\n* Colorado Plateau\n* Eastern New Mexico\n* Llano Estacado\n* Manzano Mountains\n* Mogollon Plateau\n* Northern New Mexico\n* Permian Basin\n* Rio Grande\n* Rocky Mountains\n* San Juan Basin\n* San Luis Valley\n* Sandia Mountains\n* Shortgrass prairie\n* Sangre de Cristo Mountains\n\t+ Wheeler Peak (highest point)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nJust north of Wheeler Peak is Mount Walter. At 13,141 feet (4,005\u00a0m) it is the second highest named summit in New Mexico, but it is not usually considered an independent peak as it has only about 53 feet (16\u00a0m) of topographic prominence. It is sometimes mistaken for Wheeler Peak, since it is along the standard route to Wheeler. Lake Fork Peak at 12,881 feet (3,926\u00a0m) lies just across Williams Lake and to the west of Wheeler Mountain.\n\n\nTaos Ski Valley lies to the northwest of Wheeler Peak, while both the town of Taos and Taos Pueblo are about 15 miles (24\u00a0km) to the southwest. \n\n\nWheeler Peak is the focus of the 19,661-acre (79.57\u00a0km2) Wheeler Peak Wilderness area in the Carson National Forest. Much of the mountain area just south of the peak is on Taos Pueblo land. Some 48,000 acres (190\u00a0km2) was returned to the pueblo from the Carson National Forest in 1970[4]\nand another 764 acres (3.09\u00a0km2) in 1996.[5]\n\n\n\n## Climate[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Zu\u00f1i Mountains | * Haystack Mountain\n* Mount Sedgwick\n |\n| Others | * Aden Crater\n* Alamo Hueco Mountains\n* Animas Mountains\n* Brazos Mountains\n* Caballo Mountains\n* Canjil\u00f3n Mountain\n* Canyon Creek Mountains\n* Capitan Mountains\n* Capulin Peak\n* Cedar Mountain Range\n* Datil Mountains\n* Dirty Point\n* Do\u00f1a Ana Mountains\n* Eagle Peak\n* East Potrillo Mountains\n* Elephant Butte (Hidalgo County)\n* Elephant Butte (Sierra County)\n* Fajada Butte\n* Florida Mountains\n* Franklin Mountains\n* Granite Peak\n* Guadalupe Mountains\n* Guadalupe Mountains (Hidalgo County)\n* Hosta Butte\n* Hueco Mountains\n* Hu\u00e9rfano Mountain\n* Jicarilla Mountains\n* Jornada del Muerto Volcano\n* Ladron Peak\n* Little Burro Mountains\n* Little Hatchet Mountains\n* Little San Pascual Mountain\n* Luera Mountains\n* Sierra Nacimiento\n* Ocate Peak\n* Ortiz Mountains\n* Picacho Mountain\n* Robledo Mountains\n* San Antonio Mountain\n* San Mateo Mountains (Socorro County)\n* Sierra Aguilada\n* Sierra Blanca\n* Sierra de las Uvas\n* West Potrillo Mountains\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nThe 126 highest major summits of greater North America\n |\n| --- |\n| 1.

This route passes two alpine lakes, Lost Lake and Horseshoe Lake.\n\n\nWheeler Peak has a summit register as do many major western peaks.\n\n\n\n![](image)\nPanorama from Wheeler Peak\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Mountains portal\n\n\n* List of mountain peaks of North America\n\t+ List of mountain peaks of the United States\n\t\t- List of U.S. states by elevation\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Southwestern New Mexico\n |\n| Cities | * Alamogordo\n* Albuquerque (Metropolitan Area)\n* Aztec\n* Artesia\n* Bloomfield\n* Carlsbad\n* Clovis\n* Corrales\n* Deming\n* Espa\u00f1ola\n* Farmington\n* Gallup\n* Grants\n* Hobbs\n* Kirtland\n* Las Cruces\n* Las Vegas\n* Los Alamos\n* Los Lunas\n* Lovington\n* Portales\n* Raton\n* Rio Rancho\n* Roswell\n* Ruidoso\n* Santa Fe\n* Silver City\n* Socorro\n* Sunland Park\n* Taos\n* Tucumcari\n |\n| Counties | *See: List of counties in New Mexico*\n* Bernalillo\n* Catron\n* Chaves\n* Cibola\n* Colfax\n* Curry\n* De Baca\n* Do\u00f1a Ana\n* Eddy\n* Grant\n* Guadalupe\n* Harding\n* Hidalgo\n* Lea\n* Lincoln\n* Los Alamos\n* Luna\n* McKinley\n* Mora\n* Otero\n* Quay\n* Rio Arriba\n* Roosevelt\n* San Juan\n* San Miguel\n* Sandoval\n* Santa Fe\n* Sierra\n* Socorro\n* Taos\n* Torrance\n* Union\n* Valencia\n |\n| **![flag](image) New Mexico portal**\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n108.

The route starts at the parking lot for Taos Ski Valley, and proceeds east along an old road to a broad saddle at Bull-of-the-Woods Meadow. It then turns south and winds its way among minor peaks and small valleys to gain Wheeler Peak from the north, going over the summit of Mount Walter along the way. This is a practical route, even in winter, due to low (but nonzero) avalanche exposure.\n\n\nAn alternate route is to hike south from Taos Ski Valley to Williams Lake, then take a newly constructed switchback trail to the top. This trail was completed in 2011 by a Forest Service trail crew from the Gallatin National Forest, 8 people working 12 hours per day, building 4 miles of new trail with hand tools to the top in 14 days. \n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
