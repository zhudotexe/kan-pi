Over 36,600 Asians call Staten Island home, and they represent 7.4% of the borough's population. Chinese Americans and Indian Americans were the two main Asian ethnic groups. Over 12,100 Chinese Americans and 10,000 Indian Americans live in the conurbation. People of Chinese and Indian descent make up 2.5 and 2.0% of the population, respectively. Over 7,700 Filipinos reside here, making up 1.6% of the population. Staten Island was also home to the nations highest percentages of Sri Lankans. The **Little Sri Lanka** in the Tompkinsville neighborhood of Staten Island was one of the largest Sri Lankan communities outside of the country of Sri Lanka itself.[3][4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nthough due to other racial population increases in the borough, the percentage portion of the Black residents out of the total Staten Island population slightly declined, the Hispanic population went from 81,051 residents at 17.3% in 2010 to 96,960 residents at 19.6%, a gain of 15,909 residents or 19.6%, and the Asian population experienced the largest increase from 34,697 residents at 7.4% in 2010 to 58,753 residents at 11.9% in 2020, a gain of 24,056 residents or 69.3%.[9]\n\n\n\n## Major racial groups[edit]\n\n\n### Italian Americans[edit]\n\n\nStaten Island has a higher percentage of Italian Americans than any other county in the United States, though it is 27th largest compared to other Italian American communities.[10]\n\n\nAbout 35.7% of Staten Island's residents have Italian origin. The South Shore of Staten Island has the highest proportion of Italians. Nearly 80% of the South Shore reports Italian ancestry. Several neighborhoods in the southernmost portion of the island are over 90% Italian.[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCompared to other New York City boroughs, Blacks were a relatively small percentage of Staten Island's residents. Only one out of every ten residents was Black compared to one out of every four residents in New York City overall. Of the borough's 50,000 Black residents, 47,000 were non-Hispanic, which was just under ten percent of the population. In addition, over 7,200 people identified themselves as \"Sub-Saharan African\" in the survey, which was equal to 1.5% of Staten Island's total population.\n\n\nAmerican Indians were a very small minority in Staten Island. Of the borough's 491,000 inhabitants, just over 900 were Native American. Overall, indigenous peoples make up only 0.2% of the population. People of mixed white and Native American ancestry & mixed black and Native American ancestry collectively outnumber people who were Native American alone. Over 630 people were of mixed Caucasian and Native American heritage, and over 410 people were of mixed African American and Native American heritage.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWhites were the racial majority in Staten Island. Of the borough's 491,000 people, over 382,000 were white, which was over three-quarters (75.7%) of the population. Over 323,000 non-Hispanic whites reside in the borough, and they make up 65.8% of the population. The Caucasian population was largely Italian and Irish. Sizable communities of Germans, Russians, Albanians and Poles were present. There were over 175,000 Italian Americans living in Staten Island, and they make up over one-third (35.7%) of the population. Roughly 65,000 Irish Americans live in the borough, and they make up over one-eighth (13.2%) of the population. People of German, Russian, and Polish descent make up 5.7, 3.8, and 3.4% of the population, respectively.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA large number of Italian Americans and their descendants on Staten Island are transplants who migrated from Brooklyn in the 1960s following the construction of the Verrazzano Bridge. Only a few are Italian-born.\n\n\n\n### Asian Americans[edit]\n\n\nAccording to the 2010 Census, Staten Island has a 7.4% non-Hispanic Asian population. The Asian population was mostly concentrated in the areas alongside the Staten Island Expressway. The area around Bradley Avenue has the highest concentration of Asians on Staten Island (Census tract 187.02 has a 24% Asian population, and census tract 189.02 has a 23% Asian population). Other areas with a small concentration of Asians were Graniteville, Willowbrook, Concord, Castleton Corners, Park Hill, Rosebank, South Beach, and Grasmere. There was also a small Asian concentration in Mariners' Harbor (Census Tract 231 was 13% Asian).[11]\n\n\n\n### Hispanic Americans[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOut of all of the boroughs of NYC, Staten Island has the lowest population concentration and as of the 2020 census data from New York City Department of City Planning, there were a total population of 495,747 residents with 277,981 White residents making up 56.1%, 96,960 Hispanic residents making up 19.6%, 58,753 Asian residents making up 11.9%, and 46,835 Black residents making up 9.4%. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHispanics were the fastest growing ethnic group on Staten Island.

Most African Americans reside north of the Staten Island Expressway. The only census tracts having Black majorities were tracts 319.01, 319.02, and 133.01. Tract 133.01 is the West Brighton Houses (though a few residential homes along Alaska Street were also included), and census tracts 319.01 & 319.02 were in the western portion of Mariners' Harbor (Tract 319.02 was often referred to as Arlington). Back in 2000, tracts 4 & 29 in Park Hill/Stapleton had a Black majority, but that was no longer the case, due to an increasing Hispanic and Asian population in the area.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n**Staten Island Population by year**\n| \n\n| Year\n | Inhabitants\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1900 | 67,021\n |\n| 1910 | 85,969\n |\n| 1920 | 116,531\n |\n| 1930 | 158,346\n |\n| 1940 | 174,441\n |\n| 1950 | 191,555\n |\n| 1960 | 221,991\n |\n| 1970 | 295,443\n |\n| 1980 | 352,029\n |\n| 1990 | 378,977\n |\n| 2000 | 443,728\n |\n| 2010 | 468,730\n |\n| 2020 | 475,000\n |\n\n |\n\n\nAccording to the 2009 American Community Survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau,[2] Staten Island had a population 491,730, of which 48.7% were males and 51.3% were females.

Census tract 207 in northern Port Richmond was 53% Hispanic, and census tract 133.02 in northern West Brighton was 51% Hispanic. Census tract 213 in Port Richmond was 45% Hispanic, though the Hispanic percentage was brought down due to the area east of Port Richmond Avenue being majority White (though with a noticeable Hispanic presence).

Hispanic and Black populations overwhelmingly made up the vast majority of the Borough, but the Hispanic population was two times the size of the Black population. With the Hispanic making up a more than 50% majority in the borough, it is the largest concentration of Hispanic communities of NYC. Meanwhile, the other 3 boroughs like Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens had a more or less equal diverse racial and ethnic populations than The Bronx. Of all of the NYC boroughs, The Bronx has the highest overwhelming concentration of Non-White populations and it is the only borough in all of NYC to be almost exclusively populated by Non-White enclaves.[10][11]\n\n\n\n## Demographics from the 2010 Census[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAt the 2009 American Community Survey, 31.9% of Bronx's population was foreign born and another 8.5% was born in Puerto Rico, U.S. Island areas, or born abroad to American parent(s).[23] During the 1960s, the Bronx transitioned from majority Irish, Italian and Jewish to majority Puerto Rican and African American. However, since around 2000, increases in cost of living in New York and heavy immigration from Latin America and Africa, a new transition has been taking place, with Dominicans now outnumbering Puerto Ricans and African immigrants growing in size to the African American population.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Poverty concentrations in the Bronx.\nAt the 2000 census there were 1,332,650 people, 463,212 households, and 314,984 families residing in the borough of The Bronx in New York City.

The Dominican population has been growing heavily since the 1990s. As of 2017, Dominicans made up 22.4% of the Bronx population, while Puerto Ricans made up 19.6%, giving the Bronx some of the highest concentrations of both in the country.

The migration of European Americans from parts of Queens has been long ongoing with departures from Ozone Park, Woodhaven, Bellerose, Floral Park, and Flushing (most of the outgoing population has been replaced with Asian Americans). Neighborhoods such as Whitestone, College Point, North Flushing, Auburndale, Bayside, Middle Village, and Douglaston–Little Neck have not had a substantial exodus of white residents, but have seen an increase of Asian population, mostly Chinese and Korean. Queens has experienced a real estate boom making most of its neighborhoods desirable for people who want to reside near Manhattan but in a less urban setting.\n\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t1. \"Queens\" (View: tables.
