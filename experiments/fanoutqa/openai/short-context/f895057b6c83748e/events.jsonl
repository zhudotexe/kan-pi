With the First and Second World Wars and the Great Depression, coffee exports to the United States and Europe were heavily affected, forcing the rich coffee growers to invest in the industrial activities that would make São Paulo the largest industrial center in Brazil. The new job vacancies contributed to attract a significant number of immigrants (mainly from Italy)[171] and migrants, especially from the Northeastern states.[172] From a population of only 32.000 people in 1880, São Paulo now had 8.5 million inhabitants in 1980.

Listed by the GaWC as an alpha global city, São Paulo is the most populous city outside of Asia and the world's 4th largest city proper by population. Additionally, São Paulo is the largest Portuguese-speaking city in the world. It exerts strong international influences in commerce, finance, arts and entertainment.[8] The city's name honors the Apostle, Saint Paul of Tarsus. The city's metropolitan area, the Greater São Paulo, ranks as the most populous in Brazil and the 12th most populous on Earth. The process of conurbation between the metropolitan areas around the Greater São Paulo (Campinas, Santos, Jundiaí, Sorocaba and São José dos Campos) created the São Paulo Macrometropolis,[9] a megalopolis with more than 30 million inhabitants, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSão Paulo is a cosmopolitan, melting pot city, home to the largest Arab, Italian, and Japanese diasporas, with examples including ethnic neighborhoods of Bixiga, Bom Retiro, and Liberdade. In 2016, inhabitants of the city were native to over 200 countries.[18] People from the city are known as *paulistanos*, while *paulistas* designates anyone from the state, including the *paulistanos*. The city's Latin motto, which it has shared with the battleship and the aircraft carrier named after it, is *Non ducor, duco*, which translates as \"I am not led, I lead.\"[19] The city, which is also colloquially known as *Sampa*, *Selva de Pedra* (Jungle of Stone)[20] or *Terra da Garoa* (Land of Drizzle), is known for its unreliable weather, the size of its helicopter fleet, its architecture, gastronomy, severe traffic congestion and skyscrapers. São Paulo was one of the host cities of the 1950 and the 2014 FIFA World Cup. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn a survey on the Adolescent Homicide Index (IHA), released in 2009, São Paulo ranked 151st among 267 cities with more than 100,000 inhabitants. In November 2009, the Ministry of Justice and the Brazilian Forum of Public Security published a survey that pointed to São Paulo as the safest Brazilian capital for young people. Between 2000 and 2010, the city of São Paulo reduced its homicide rate by 78%. According to data from the Map of Violence 2011, published by the Sangari Institute and the Ministry of Justice, the city of São Paulo has the lowest homicide rate per 100,000 inhabitants among all Brazilian capitals.\n\n\n\n### Social challenges[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Social issues in Brazil\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSão Paulo is considered the most multicultural city in Brazil. From 1870 to 2010, approximately 2.3 million immigrants arrived in the state, from all parts of the world. The Italian community is one of the strongest, with a presence throughout the city. Of the 12 million inhabitants of São Paulo, 50% (6 million people) have full or partial Italian ancestry. São Paulo has more descendants of Italians than any Italian city (the largest city of Italy is Rome, with 2.8 million inhabitants).[90]\n\n\n\n| Race and ethnicity in São Paulo |\n| --- |\n| Ethnicity |  | Percentage |\n| White |  | 60.6% |\n| Pardo (Multiracial) |  | 30.5% |\n| Black |  | 6.5% |\n| Asian |  | 2.2% |\n| Amerindian |  | 0.2% |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  • Macrometropolis | 33,652,991[4] |\n| Demonym | Paulistan |\n| Time zone | UTC– 03:00 (BRT) |\n| Postal Code (CEP) | 01000-000\n |\n| Area code | +55 11 |\n| **HDI** (2010) | 0.805 – very high[5] |\n| PPP (2021) | US$589 billion[6] (1st) |\n| Per Capita | US$47,484[6] (1st) |\n| Nominal (2021) | US$278 billion[7] (1st) |\n| Per Capita | US$22,404[6] (1st) |\n| Primary Airport | São Paulo–Guarulhos International Airport |\n| Secondary Airports | São Paulo–Congonhas AirportCampo de Marte Airport |\n| Interstates | ![](image) ![](image) ![](image) |\n| Rapid Transit | São Paulo Metro |\n| Commuter Rail | CPTM |\n| Website | www.capital.sp.gov.br |\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_kNOHmCvNLpH06Xha3dMmB12Z","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

However, this number is disputed by obstetrics researcher Yi Fuxian, who argues that data related to population growth is inflated by local governments to obtain financial subsidies from the central government.[18]\n\n\n\n#### Population of China by age and sex (demographic pyramid)[edit]\n\n\n* ![China population pyramid as of 1st National Census day on June 30, 1953](image)\n\nChina population pyramid as of 1st National Census day on June 30, 1953\n* ![China population pyramid as of 2nd National Census day on July 1, 1964](image)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

In 1987, the government announced that the fourth national census would take place in 1990 and that there would be one every ten years thereafter. The 1982 census (which reported a total population of 1,008,180,738) is generally accepted as significantly more reliable, accurate, and thorough than the previous two.[15] Various international organizations eagerly assisted the Chinese in conducting the 1982 census, including the United Nations Fund for Population Activities, which donated US$100.0 million between 1980-1989 for a variety of projects, one of which being the 1982 census.[16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n33. **^** Jamil Anderliniin; Ed Crooks (19 January 2013). \"Chinese Labor Pool Begins to Drain\". *CNBC*.

It was by far the most thorough and accurate census taken since 1949 and confirmed that China was a nation of more than 1 billion people, or about one-fifth of the world's population. The census provided demographers with a set of data on China's age-sex structure, fertility and mortality rates, and population density and distribution. Information was also gathered on minority ethnic groups, urban population, and marital status. For the first time since the People's Republic of China was founded, demographers had reliable information on the size and composition of the Chinese work force. The nation began preparing for the 1982 census in late 1976. Chinese census workers were sent to the United States and Japan to study modern census-taking techniques and automation. Computers were installed in every provincial-level unit except Tibet and were connected to a central processing system in the Beijing headquarters of the State Statistical Bureau. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region\n | 6,100,104\n | 1.05\n | 12,348,638\n | 1.78\n | 19,274,279\n | 1.91\n | 21,456,798\n | 1.89\n | 23,760,000\n | 1.88\n | 24,706,321\n | 1.84\n | 24,049,155\n | 1.70\n |\n| Rehe *(now defunct)* | 5,160,822\n | 0.89\n |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Liaoning | 18,545,147\n | 3.18\n | 26,946,200\n | 3.88\n | 35,721,693\n | 3.54\n | 39,459,697\n | 3.48\n | 42,380,000\n | 3.35\n | 43,746,323\n | 3.27\n | 42,591,407\n | 3.02\n |\n| Jilin | 11,290,073\n | 1.94\n | 15,668,663\n | 2.26\n | 22,560,053\n | 2.24\n | 24,658,721\n | 2.18\n | 27,280,000\n | 2.16\n | 27,462,297\n | 2.05\n | 24,073,453\n | 1.71\n |\n| Heilongjiang | 11,897,309\n | 2.04\n | 20,118,271\n | 2.90\n | 32,665,546\n | 3.24\n | 35,214,873\n | 3.11\n | 39,890,000\n | 2.91\n | 38,312,224\n | 2.86\n | 31,850,088\n | 2.26\n |\n| Shanghai Municipality\n | 6,204,417\n | 1.06\n | 10,816,458\n | 1.56\n | 11,859,748\n | 1.18\n | 13,341,896\n | 1.18\n | 16,740,000\n | 1.32\n | 23,019,148\n | 1.72\n | 24,870,895\n | 1.76\n |\n| Jiangsu | 41,252,192\n | 7.08\n | 44,504,608\n | 6.41\n | 60,521,114\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_40DdlYsG6PaONTqcgyJLJpvw","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

Many of them live close to bus or train stations, although suburban residents spend significant time travelling southward to the main commercial district.[332] Dharavi, Asia's second largest slum (if Karachi's Orangi Town is counted as a single slum)[333] is located in central Mumbai and houses between 800,000 and 10 lakh (one million) people[334] in 2.39 km2 (0.92 sq mi), making it one of the most densely populated areas on Earth[335] with a population density of at least 334,728 persons per square kilometre.[336]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Mumbai** (/mʊmˈbaɪ/ ⓘ, Marathi: [ˈmumbəi], IAST: *Muṃbaī*; also known as **Bombay**[a] — the official name until 1995) is the capital city of the Indian state of Maharashtra.

The same increase took 61 years in Italy, 85 years in Sweden, and 115 years in France.[30] In 2014, 26% of Japan's population was estimated to be 65 years or older,[31] and the Health and Welfare Ministry has estimated that over-65s will account for 40% of the population by 2060.[32] The demographic shift in Japan's age profile has triggered concerns about the nation's economic future and the viability of its welfare state.[33]\n\n\n\n* ![1888](image)\n\n1888\n* ![1920 (1st national census of population)](image)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n1970 (11th national census of population)\n* ![1975 (12th national census of population)](image)\n\n1975 (12th national census of population)\n* ![1980 (13th national census of population)](image)\n\n1980 (13th national census of population)\n* ![1985 (14th national census of population)](image)\n\n1985 (14th national census of population)\n* ![1990 (15th national census of population)](image)\n\n1990 (15th national census of population)\n* ![1995 (16th national census of population)](image)\n\n1995 (16th national census of population)\n* ![2000 (17th national census of population)](image)\n\n2000 (17th national census of population)\n* ![2005 (18th national census of population)](image)\n\n2005 (18th national census of population)\n* ![2010 (19th national census of population)](image)\n\n2010 (19th national census of population)\n* ![2015 (20th national census of population)](image)\n\n2015 (20th national census of population)\n* ![2019 estimate](image)\n\n2019 estimate\n* ![Live births and deaths of Japan (1946-2019)](image)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAccording to a demographic study conducted by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, as of 2023, Japan's population was 125.4 million residents including foreign residents[*Does this mean foreign nationals resident in Japan?*], declined from 128 million people in 2010 to its lowest level on record since 1900, with fewer of almost 511,000 people from the previous year.[17][18]\n\n\n\n![](image)Japanese population density map per prefecture as of 2022 per square kilometer0–100\n 101–200\n 201–300\n 301–400\n 401–500\n 500–1000\n 1000–5514\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

According to the *Economic Survey of Delhi*, the metropolis has a net State Domestic Product (SDP) of Rs. 830.85 billion (for the year 2004–05)[102] and a per capita income of Rs. 53,976 ($1,200).[102] In the year 2008–09 New Delhi had a per capita Income of Rs. 116,886 ($2,595). It grew by 16.2% to reach Rs. 135,814 ($3,018) in 2009–10 fiscal. New Delhi's per capita GDP (at PPP) was at $6,860 during 2009–10 fiscal, making it one of the richest cities in India. The tertiary sector contributes 78.4% of Delhi's gross SDP followed by secondary and primary sectors with 20.2% and 1.4% contribution respectively.[102]\n\n\nThe gross state domestic product (GSDP) of Delhi at prices for the year 2011–12 has been estimated at Rs 3.13 trillion (short scale), which is an increase of 18.7 per cent over the previous fiscal.[103]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe districts of the NCT were redrawn in 2012 and include a district called New Delhi, albeit with different borders than the municipality.

It has an estimated net State Domestic Product (FY 2010) of ₹1,595 billion (US$19 billion) in nominal terms and ~₹6,800 billion (US$81 billion) in PPP terms.[98] As of 2013[update], the per capita income of Delhi was Rs. 230000, second highest in India after Goa. GSDP in Delhi at the prices for 2012–13 is estimated at Rs 3.88 trillion (short scale) against Rs 3.11 trillion (short scale) in 2011–12.[99]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIt took about 20 years to build the city from 1911.[121] Many elements of New Delhi architecture borrow from indigenous sources; however, they fit into a British Classical/Palladian tradition. The fact that there were any indigenous features in the design were due to the persistence and urging of both the Viceroy Lord Hardinge and historians like E.B. Havell.[110]\n\n\nIn the year 2019, Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs and Government of India introduced the Central Vista redevelopment project proposing the redevelopment of over 440 Hectares,[122] costing ₹20,000 crore (equivalent to ₹240 billion or US$2.8 billion in 2023)[123]\n\n\n\n## Transport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transport in Delhi\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Climate data for New Delhi (Delhi Ridge) 1991–2020, extremes 1971–present\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 27.5(81.5)\n | 34.2(93.6)\n | 40.9(105.6)\n | 45.7(114.3)\n | 47.2(117.0)\n | 47.9(118.2)\n | 42.5(108.5)\n | 40.4(104.7)\n | 38.4(101.1)\n | 38.4(101.1)\n | 34.2(93.6)\n | 29.8(85.6)\n | 47.9(118.2)\n |\n| Mean maximum °C (°F)\n | 24.4(75.9)\n | 29.6(85.3)\n | 36.4(97.5)\n | 42.8(109.0)\n | 45.7(114.3)\n | 44.8(112.6)\n | 40.4(104.7)\n | 37.7(99.9)\n | 36.8(98.2)\n | 36.4(97.5)\n | 32.5(90.5)\n | 27.2(81.0)\n | 45.9(114.6)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | 19.0(66.2)\n | 24.4(75.9)\n | 31.0(87.8)\n | 37.0(98.6)\n | 40.7(105.3)\n | 39.8(103.6)\n | 35.1(95.2)\n | 33.9(93.0)\n | 34.0(93.2)\n | 33.4(92.1)\n | 28.0(82.4)\n | 22.5(72.5)\n | 31.4(88.5)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | 8.7(47.7)\n | 12.1(53.8)\n | 16.8(62.2)\n | 22.0(71.6)\n | 25.9(78.6)\n | 27.0(80.6)\n | 26.1(79.0)\n | 25.5(77.9)\n | 24.1(75.4)\n | 20.3(68.5)\n | 15.1(59.2)\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_5a7ObMpdGGB4Z9NS8enRHOJv","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
