Imbens (b. 1962) \"for their methodological contributions to the analysis of causal relationships.\"[2][3][4][5] The Nobel Committee stated their reason behind the decision, saying: \n\n\n> \"This year's Laureates \u2013 David Card, Joshua Angrist and Guido Imbens \u2013 have shown that natural experiments can be used to answer central questions for society, such as how minimum wages and immigration affect the labour market. They have also clarified exactly which conclusions about cause and effect can be drawn using this research approach. Together, they have revolutionised empirical research in the economic sciences.\"[6]\n> \n> \n\n\nCard's key contributions on economics were the natural experiments on labour economics (including difference in differences). Angrist and Imbens' contributions were on the local average treatment effect and natural experiments to estimate causal links.[3][4]\n\n\n\n\n## Laureates[edit]\n\n\n### David Card[edit]\n\n\nMain article: David Card\n\nDavid Card was born in Guelph, Ontario, in 1956.[7] Card earned his Bachelor of Arts degree from Queen's University in 1978 and his Ph.D. degree in economics in 1983 from Princeton University, after completing a doctoral dissertation, titled \"Indexation in long term labor contracts\", under the supervision of Orley Ashenfelter.[8][9] Card began his career at the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business, where he was Assistant Professor of Business Economics for 2 years. He was on the faculty at Princeton University from 1983 to 1997, before moving to Berkeley; from 1990 to 1991 he served as a visiting professor at Columbia University.[10] From 1988 to 1992, Card was Associate Editor of the *Journal of Labor Economics* and from 1993 to 1997, he was co-editor of *Econometrica*. From 2002 to 2005, he was co-editor of *The American Economic Review*.[10] He was the recipient of the 1995 John Bates Clark Medal and the 2014 BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award in Economics, Finance and Management with Richard Blundell \"for their contributions to empirical microeconomics.\"\n\n\n\n### Joshua Angrist[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Joshua Angrist\n\nAngrist was born to a Jewish family in Columbus, Ohio, and raised in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where he graduated from Taylor Allderdice High School in 1977.[11][12] Angrist received his B.A. in economics from Oberlin College in 1982. He lived in Israel from 1982 until 1985 and served as a paratrooper in the Israeli Defence Forces.[13] Angrist received a M.A. and a Ph.D. in economics from Princeton University in 1987 and 1989, respectively. His doctoral dissertation, *Econometric Analysis of the Vietnam Era Draft Lottery*, was supervised by Orley Ashenfelter[14] and later published in parts in the *American Economic Review*.[15] After completing his Ph.D., Angrist joined Harvard University as an assistant professor until 1991, when he returned to Israel as a senior lecturer (equivalent to an assistant professor in the US system) at the Hebrew University.[16] After being promoted to associate professor at Hebrew University, he joined MIT's Economics Department in 1996 as associate professor, before being raised to full professor in 1998. Since 2008, he has been MIT's Ford Professor of Economics and teaches econometrics and labor economics to its students. He additionally served as the Wesley Clair Mitchell Visiting Professor at Columbia University in 2018.[17] He was the recipient of the 2011 John von Neumann Award given annually by the Rajk L\u00e1szl\u00f3 College for Advanced Studies in Budapest.\n\n\n\n### Guido Imbens[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Guido Imbens\n\nGuido Wilhelmus Imbens was born on 3 September 1963 in Geldrop, the Netherlands.[18][19] In high school Imbens was introduced to the work of Dutch economist Jan Tinbergen. Influenced by Tinbergen's work, Imbens chose to study economics at Erasmus University Rotterdam, where Tinbergen had taught and established a program in economics.[20] Imbens graduated with a Candidate's degree in Econometrics from Erasmus University Rotterdam in 1983. He subsequently obtained an M.Sc. degree *with distinction* in Economics and Econometrics from the University of Hull in Kingston upon Hull, UK in 1986. In 1986, one of Imbens' mentors at the University of Hull, Anthony Lancaster, moved to Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. Imbens followed Lancaster to Brown to pursue further graduate and doctoral studies.[21] Imbens received an A.M. and a Ph.D. degree in economics from Brown in 1989 and 1991, respectively.[22][23]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"The Nobel Prize amounts\".

Bernanke, Douglas W. Diamond, and Philip H. Dybvig \"for research on banks and financial crises\" on 10 October 2022.[1][2] The award was established in 1968 by an endowment \"in perpetuity\" from Sweden's central bank, Sveriges Riksbank, to commemorate the bank's 300th anniversary.[3][4] Laureates in the Memorial Prize in Economics are selected by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.[5] The Nobel Committee announced the reason behind their recognition, stating:\n\n\n> \"This year\u2019s laureates in the Economic Sciences, Ben Bernanke, Douglas Diamond and Philip Dybvig, have significantly improved our understanding of the role of banks in the economy, particularly during financial crises. An important finding in their research is why avoiding bank collapses is vital.\"\n> \n> \n\n\nBen Bernanke's key contributions were his research on the role of bank crises in the Great Depression of the 1930s and his response to the 2007\u20132008 financial crisis as head of the US Federal Reserve. Douglas Diamond and Philip Dybvig\u2019s, on the other hand, was on the development of their Diamond\u2013Dybvig model of bank runs.[6][7]\n\n\n\n\n## Laureates[edit]\n\n\n### Ben Bernanke[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ben Bernanke\n\nBen Bernanke was born in Augusta, Georgia, in 1953. Bernanke earned his Bachelors and Master of Arts degree in economics in Harvard University in 1975, receiving his Ph.D. degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1979. He became a tenured professor of economics at Princeton University from 1996 to 2002, before joining the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System from 2002 to 2005. He then served as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President George W.

Much of Card's work centers on a comparison between the United States and Canada in various situations. On immigration, Card's research has shown that the economic impact of new immigrants is minimal. Card has done several case studies on the rapid assimilation of immigrant groups, finding that they have little or no impact on wages. For example, Card studied the economic impacts of the Mariel boatlift, and compared the economic effects in Miami to those in Atlanta, Houston, Los Angeles and Tampa, which receive fewer Cuban immigrants.[8] Card found that despite the drastic increase in low-skilled labor in Miami by 7%, wages for the low-skilled workers were not significantly affected. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHe was the recipient of the 1995 John Bates Clark Medal, awarded to \"that American economist under the age of forty who is judged to have made the most significant contribution to economic thought and knowledge\" for his work related to the minimum wage as well as the economic effects of the Mariel boatlift.[8] He gave the 2009 Richard T.

Prespecified conditions will allow for broad agreement amongst researchers in regard to methodology, he believed that this work would allow for acceptance of this standard in economics. The value of firm-level microdata which would allow for a deeper understanding of factors that determine wages and alter the analysis of a variety of topics allowing for greater precision in data sets. Card concludes the work through emphasizing the importance of empirical research to create a more complete understanding of the low-wage market.[29]\n\n\n\n## Awards[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nFrisch Medal recipients\n |\n| --- |\n| * Angus S.

He is also a fellow of the Econometric Society. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2006.[68] In 2007 Angrist received an honorary doctorate in Economics from the University of St. Gallen. He is the recipient of the 2011 John von Neumann Award given annually by the Rajk L\u00e1szl\u00f3 College for Advanced Studies in Budapest.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAngrist's research interests include the economics of education and school reform, social programs and the labor market, the effects of immigration, labor market regulation and institutions, and econometric methods for program and policy evaluation.[17] He ranks among the top 50 out of over 56,000 economists registered on IDEAS/RePEc in terms of research output.[18] He is a frequent co-author of Guido Imbens, Alan B. Krueger, Victor Lavy, Parag Pathak and J\u00f6rn-Steffen Pischke.[19] Together with Pischke, Angrist published *Mostly Harmless Econometrics* in 2009, in which they explore econometric tools used by empirical researchers.[20] In 2014, Angrist and Pischke released *Mastering 'Metrics': The Path from Cause to Effect*, which is targeted at undergraduate econometrics students.\n\n\n\n### Economics of education[edit]\n\n\n#### Research on the returns to schooling[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHis doctoral dissertation, *Econometric Analysis of the Vietnam Era Draft Lottery*, was supervised by Orley Ashenfelter[11] and later published in parts in the *American Economic Review*.[12] After completing his Ph.D., Angrist joined Harvard University as an assistant professor until 1991, when he returned to Israel as a senior lecturer (equivalent to an Assistant Professor in the US system) at the Hebrew University.[13] After being promoted to associate professor at Hebrew University, he joined MIT's Economics Department in 1996 as associate professor, before being raised to full professor in 1998. Since 2008, he has been MIT's Ford Professor of Economics and teaches econometrics and labor economics to its students. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBesides his empirical research, Angrist has also made major contributions to econometrics, especially concerning the use of instrumental variables estimations. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe bulk of Angrist's research has concentrated on the economics of education, beginning with the returns to schooling. In one early study, Angrist and Krueger exploited the relationship between children's season of birth and educational attainment that is due to policies and laws setting ages for school start and compulsory schooling, finding that returns to education are close to their OLS estimates[21] and that compulsory attendance laws constrain roughly 10% of students to stay in school who would have otherwise left.[22] Another early attempt at using IV to estimate returns to schooling by Angrist and Krueger was to exploit the Vietnam-era draft lottery.[23] However, while their later research on split-sample IVs confirmed the findings of their compulsory schooling research, it failed to support the returns to schooling estimates derived from the draft-lottery research.[24] Angrist further used variation in U.S. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n26. **^** Angrist, Joshua D.

Bill), he finds that these benefits raised schooling in the U.S. by ca. 1.4 years and veterans' earnings by 6%.[45] In further work exploiting the idiosyncrasies of U.S. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n54. **^** Angrist, Joshua D.; Kugler, Adriana D.

Influenced by Tinbergen's work, Imbens chose to study econometrics at Erasmus University Rotterdam, where Tinbergen had taught and established a program in econometrics.[13] Imbens graduated with a Candidate's degree in Econometrics from Erasmus University Rotterdam in 1983. He subsequently obtained an M.Sc. degree *with distinction* in Economics and Econometrics from the University of Hull in Kingston upon Hull, UK in 1986.[1]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1986, one of Imbens' mentors at the University of Hull, Anthony Lancaster, moved to Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. Imbens followed Lancaster to Brown to pursue further graduate and doctoral studies.[14] Imbens received an A.M. and a Ph.D. degree in Economics from Brown in 1989 and 1991, respectively.[15][1][16]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Department of Economics at Brown University\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The Stanford Graduate School of Business, where Imbens has taught since 2012\nImbens is a fellow of the Econometric Society (2001) and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (2009).[1][19][20] Imbens was elected to the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences as a foreign member in 2017.[21][22] He was elected as a Fellow of the American Statistical Association in 2020.[23]\n\n\n\n### Econometrics and work on causal relationships[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nImbens has taught at Tilburg University (1989-1990), Harvard University (1990\u201397, 2007\u201312), the University of California, Los Angeles (1997\u20132001), and the University of California, Berkeley (2001\u201307). He specializes in econometrics, which are particular methods for drawing causal inference.[1] He became the editor of *Econometrica* in 2019, with his term anticipated (as of 2022) to end in 2025.[17] As of 2021, he is a professor of applied econometrics and economics at Stanford Graduate School of Business.

The group studied the implications of policy interventions such as Universal Basic Income or other federal and state wage assistance programs on citizens' willingness to participate in the labor force and the eventual impact on labor supply.[26] To devise a natural experiment, the group studied the winners of the Massachusetts state lottery where the winners were paid incrementally over many years as opposed to a lump-sum payment. In doing so, the group was able to study the causal effects of guaranteed income. They found that winning the lottery had only a small impact on how much people worked. Winners of $80,000 a year for 20 years reduced their working hours somewhat, but winners of $15,000 a year for 20 years did not. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn one of his earliest collaborations with Angrist, Imbens introduced a concept called Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE) to draw causal inference from observational data. In a 1994 *Econometrica* paper titled \"Identification and Estimation of Local Average Treatment Effects\", the pair employed the idea of natural experiments, where one studies the effects of key changes by using chance and randomization that naturally occur in the real world, instead of controlled conditions, which can be expensive, time-consuming, or even unethical.[5][18] The paper and the model had significant impact on other research efforts across econometrics, statistics and other fields.[6][8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

He received a Ph.D. degree in economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1979 after completing and defending his dissertation, *Long-Term Commitments, Dynamic Optimization, and the Business Cycle*.

The Bernankes have two children, Joel and Alyssa.[87] He is an ardent fan of the Washington Nationals baseball team, and frequently attends games at Nationals Park.[88]\n\n\nWhen Bernanke left Stanford to accept a position at Princeton, he and his family moved to Montgomery Township, New Jersey, in 1985, where Bernanke's children attended the local public schools.[89] Bernanke served for six years as a member of the board of education of the Montgomery Township School District.[89]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBernanke was born in Augusta, Georgia, and was raised on East Jefferson Street in Dillon, South Carolina.[12] His father Philip was a pharmacist and part-time theater manager. His mother Edna was an elementary school teacher.[13] Bernanke has two younger siblings. His brother, Seth, is a lawyer in Charlotte, North Carolina. His sister, Sharon, is a longtime administrator at Berklee College of Music in Boston.\n\n\nThe Bernankes were one of the few Jewish families in Dillon and attended Ohav Shalom, a local synagogue;[14] Bernanke learned Hebrew as a child from his maternal grandfather, Harold Friedman, a professional hazzan (cantor), shochet, and Hebrew teacher.[15][16] Bernanke's father and uncle owned and managed a drugstore they purchased from Bernanke's paternal grandfather, Jonas Bernanke.[12]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nJonas Bernanke was born in Boryslav, Austria-Hungary (today part of Ukraine), on January 23, 1891.

On the ship's manifest, Jonas's occupation is listed as \"clerk\" and Pauline's as \"doctor med\".[17][18]\n\n\nThe family moved to Dillon from New York in the 1940s.[19] Bernanke's mother gave up her job as a schoolteacher when her son was born and worked at the family drugstore. Ben Bernanke also worked there sometimes.[14]\n\n\n\n### Young adult[edit]\n\n\nAs a teenager, Bernanke worked construction on a hospital and waited tables at a restaurant at nearby South of the Border, which was a roadside attraction, amusement park, and fireworks retailer near his hometown in Hamer, South Carolina, before leaving for college.[12][20][21] To support himself throughout college, he continued to work during the summers at South of the Border.[12][22]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)With his predecessor, Alan Greenspan, looking on, Chairman Ben Bernanke addresses President George W.

Bush's Council of Economic Advisers before President Bush nominated him to succeed Alan Greenspan as chairman of the United States Federal Reserve.[7] His first term began on February 1, 2006.[8] Bernanke was confirmed for a second term as chairman on January 28, 2010, after being renominated by President Barack Obama, who later referred to him as \"the epitome of calm.\"[9] His second term ended on January 31, 2014, when he was succeeded by Janet Yellen on February 3, 2014.[10]\n\n\nBernanke wrote about his time as chairman of the Federal Reserve in his 2015 book, *The Courage to Act*, in which he revealed that the world's economy came close to collapse in 2007 and 2008. Bernanke asserts that it was only the novel efforts of the Fed (cooperating with other US agencies and agencies of other governments) that prevented an economic catastrophe greater than the Great Depression.[11]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and family[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Diamond matriculated at Brown University, where he decided to study economics instead, after taking a course on Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz's *A Monetary History of the United States*.[7][8] He graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Brown with a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics in 1975.[9] The following year, and in 1977 Diamond earned Master's degrees, and ultimately a PhD in economics in 1980 from Yale University.[9] At Yale, both Diamond and future Nobel co-recipient Philip H. Dybvig were advised by Stephen A. Ross. According to Diamond, the two would regularly converse outside Ross' office while waiting for appointments with him.[10][11]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAmerican economist\n\n\n\n| Douglas Diamond\n |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)Diamond at the White House in 2022\n |\n| Born | Douglas Warren Diamond\n (1953-10-25) October 25, 1953 (age\u00a070) |\n| Known\u00a0for | Diamond\u2013Dybvig model |\n| Children | Rebecca Diamond |\n| Awards | Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences (2022) |\n|  |\n| Academic background |\n| Education | Brown University (BA)Yale University (MA, MPhil, PhD) |\n| Thesis | *Essays on Information and Financial Intermediation*\u00a0(1980) |\n| Doctoral advisor | Stephen A.

In 2011, Diamond was listed by Thomson Reuters as one of the \"researchers likely to be in contention for Nobel honors based on the citation impact of their published research.\"[15] He was again named as a contender for the prize in 2013 by economist Hubert Fromlet,[16] *The Wall Street Journal,*[17] and Catherine Rampell, writing for *The New York Times.*[18]\n\n\nOn October 10, 2022, Diamond received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences jointly with long-time collaborator Philip H. Dybvig and former Chair of the Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke. Much of the work for which the prize was awarded stems from work Diamond and Dybvig published in the early and mid-1980s.[19]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nDiamond has been married to Elizabeth Cammack Diamond since 1982.[20] The couple has two children,[21] including economist Rebecca Diamond.[22]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Douglas Diamond's Curriculum Vitae\" (PDF).

He is the Boatmen's Bancshares Professor of Banking and Finance at the Olin Business School of Washington University in St. Louis.[1][2]\n\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nDybvig attended Indiana University and received in 1976 a BA in mathematics and physics. He then attended the economics PhD program at University of Pennsylvania for one year before transferring to Yale University, where he received the MA (1978), MPhil (1978), and PhD (1979) degrees in economics.[3] His thesis, titled \"Recovering additive utility functions\", was supervised by Stephen A. Ross.[4]\n\n\nDybvig specializes in asset pricing, banking, investments, and corporate governance.[5] He was formerly a professor at Yale University, and assistant professor at Princeton University. \n\n\nDybvig was president of the Western Finance Association from 2002 to 2003, and was director of the Institute of Financial Studies at Southwestern University of Finance and Economics (Chengdu, PRC) from 2010 to 2021. He has been editor or associate editor of multiple journals, including the *Journal of Economic Theory*, *Finance and Stochastics*, *Journal of Finance*, *Journal of Financial Intermediation*, *Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis*, and *Review of Financial Studies*.[3]\n\n\nDybvig is known for his work with Douglas Diamond on the Diamond\u2013Dybvig model of bank runs.[6]\n\n\nDybvig was awarded the 2022 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, jointly with Diamond and Ben Bernanke, \"for research on banks and financial crises\".[7][8] Dybvig and Diamond wrote \u201cBank Runs, Deposit Insurance, and Liquidity\u201d in 1983, in which they first introduced their mathematical model describing the vulnerability of banks during financial crises.\n\n\n\n## Alleged sexual misconduct[edit]\n\n\nIn October 2022, Dybvig was anonymously accused of sexual harassment by several Chinese women attending Washington University\u2019s Olin School of Business, where Dybvig works as a professor.[9][10] He is on absentee leave until July 2023. Dybvig's lawyer has denied the allegations. Bloomberg News reported that he was said to have called one of the students \"ti\u00e1n m\u00e8izi\" (\u751c\u59b9\u5b50), meaning \"sweet young girl\" and gave her gifts of chocolate.[11] The encounters allegedly led the Chinese female students to warn each other about him.[11]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"2022 Nobel Prize Celebrates Banking Research\". *www.nber.org*.
