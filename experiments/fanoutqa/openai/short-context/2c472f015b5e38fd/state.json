Seoul proper comprises 605.25\u00a0km2 (233.69\u00a0sq\u00a0mi),[3] with a radius of approximately 15\u00a0km (9\u00a0mi), roughly bisected into northern and southern halves by the Han River. The river is no longer actively used for navigation, because its estuary is located at the borders of the two Koreas, with civilian entry barred. There are four main mountains in central Seoul: Bugaksan, Inwangsan, Naksan and Namsan. The Seoul Fortress Wall, which historically bounded the city, goes over these mountains. The city is bordered by eight mountains, as well as the more level lands of the Han River plain and western areas.\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate of Seoul\n\n\n\n|  Seoul\n |\n| --- |\n| Climate chart (explanation) |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| J\n | F\n | M\n | A\n | M\n | J\n | J\n | A\n | S\n | O\n | N\n | D\n |\n| 17\n\n\n\n2\n\n\u22126\n | 28\n\n\n\n5\n\n\u22123\n | 37\n\n\n\n11\n\n2\n | 73\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\uc11c\uc6b8\n |\n| --- |\n| Special city\n |\n| Seoul Special City\uc11c\uc6b8\ud2b9\ubcc4\uc2dc |\n| ![](image)\nSkyline of Seoul at night\n![](image)\nDeoksugung\n![](image)\nKorean National Assembly\n![](image)\nLotte World and Lotte World Tower\n![](image)\nGwanghwamun\n![](image)\nSeongsan Bridge over the Han River\n |\n| \n![Flag of Seoul](image)Flag\n![Official seal of Seoul](image)Seal\n![Coat of arms of Seoul](image)Coat of arms\n |\n| Motto(s):\u00a0\"Seoul, my soul\"[1]\n |\n| Anthem: *none*[2] |\n| ![Map](image)Show Seoul\n![Map](image)Show South Korea\n |\n| Coordinates: 37\u00b033\u203236\u2033N 126\u00b059\u203224\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff37.56000\u00b0N 126.99000\u00b0E\ufeff / 37.56000; 126.99000 |\n| Country | Republic of Korea |\n| Area | Seoul Capital |\n| Founded by | Gen.

The Gyeongbok Palace, built in the 14th century, served as the royal residence until 1592. The other large palace, Changdeokgung, constructed in 1405, served as the main royal palace from 1611 to 1872.[19] After Joseon changed its name to the Korean Empire in 1897, Hwangseong also designated Seoul.[*clarification needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSeoul is geographically set in a mountainous and hilly terrain, with Bukhan Mountain positioned on its northern edge. Within the Seoul Capital Area lie five UNESCO World Heritage Sites: Changdeok Palace, Hwaseong Fortress, Jongmyo Shrine, Namhansanseong, and the Royal Tombs of the Joseon dynasty.[12] Furthermore, Seoul has witnessed a surge in modern architectural development, with iconic landmarks including the N Seoul Tower, the 63 Building, the Lotte World Tower, the Dongdaemun Design Plaza, Lotte World, the Trade Tower, COEX, IFC Seoul, and Parc1. Seoul was named the World Design Capital in 2010 and has served as the national hub for the music, entertainment, and cultural industries that have propelled K-pop and the Korean Wave to international prominence.\n\n\n\n\n## Toponomy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Names of Seoul\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter World War II and the liberation of Korea, the city took its present name, which originated from the Korean word meaning \"capital city\", which is believed to have descended from an ancient word, *Seorabeol* (\uc11c\ub77c\ubc8c; \u5f90\u7f85\u4f10), which originally referred to Gyeongju, the capital of Silla.[16] Ancient Gyeongju was also known in documents by the Chinese-style name *Geumseong* (\u91d1\u57ce, literally \"Gold Castle or City\" or \"Metal Castle or City\"), but it is unclear whether the native Korean-style name *Seorabeol* had the same meaning as *Geumseong*.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nUnlike most place names in Korea, \"Seoul\" has no corresponding Hanja (Chinese characters used in the Korean language). On 18 January 2005, the Seoul government changed its official name in Chinese characters from the historic *Hancheng* (simplified Chinese: \u6c49\u57ce; traditional Chinese: \u6f22\u57ce; pinyin: *H\u00e0nch\u00e9ng*) to *Shou'er* (\u9996\u5c14; \u9996\u723e; *Sh\u01d2u'\u011br*).[17][18]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Seoul\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* i Tour Seoul \u2013 The Official Seoul Tourism Guide Site\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Preceded\u00a0by |  **Capital of Baekje** 18 BC \u2013 475 AD\n | Succeeded\u00a0byUngjin\n |\n| Preceded\u00a0byGaegyeong\n |  **Capital of Korea** 1394\u2013present\n |  Succeeded\u00a0byIncumbent\n |\n| Preceded\u00a0byNew creation\n |  **Capital of South Korea** 1948\u2013present\n |  Succeeded\u00a0byIncumbent\n |\n\n\n| Articles related to Seoul\n |\n| --- |\n| | * v\n* t\n* e\nSeoul\n |\n| --- |\n| * Government\n\t+ Council\n\t+ Mayor\n\t+ City Hall\n* History\n\t+ Names\n\t+ Timeline\n* Climate\n* Economy\n* Shopping\n* Sport\n* Transport\n |\n| Districts | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| North of the Han River (Gangbuk) | * Dobong\n* Dongdaemun\n* Eunpyeong\n* Gangbuk\n* Gwangjin\n* Jongno\n* Jung\n* Jungnang\n* Mapo\n* Nowon\n* Seodaemun\n* Seongbuk\n* Seongdong\n* Yongsan\n |\n| South of the Han River (Gangnam) | * Dongjak\n* Gangdong\n* Gangnam\n* Gangseo\n* Geumcheon\n* Guro\n* Gwanak\n* Songpa\n* Seocho\n* Yangcheon\n* Yeongdeungpo\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nCapital of South Korea\n\nThis article is about the capital city of South Korea.

Cheonggyecheon, a stream that runs from west to east through the valley before emptying into the Han River, was for many years covered with concrete, but was recently restored by an urban revival project in 2005.[116] Jongno street, meaning \"Bell Street\", has been a principal street and one of the earliest commercial streets of the city,[117][118] on which one can find Bosingak, a pavilion containing a large bell. The bell signaled the different times of the day and controlled the four major gates to the city. North of downtown is Bukhan Mountain, and to the south is the smaller Namsan. Further south are the old suburbs, Yongsan District and Mapo District. Across the Han River are the newer and wealthier areas of Gangnam District, Seocho District and surrounding neighborhoods.\n\n\n\n### Historical architecture[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n14. **^** Yu, Woo-ik; Lee, Chan (6 November 2019). \"Seoul\". *Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica*.

One of the most famous parks is Namsan Park, which offers recreational hiking and views of the downtown Seoul skyline, especially via its N Seoul Tower. Seoul Olympic Park, located in Songpa District and built to host the 1988 Summer Olympics, is the largest park. The areas near the stream Tancheon are popular for exercise. Cheonggyecheon also has spaces for recreation. In 2017 the Seoullo 7017 Skypark opened, spanning diagonally overtop Seoul Station.\n\n\nThere are also many parks along the Han River, such as Ichon Hangang Park, Yeouido Hangang Park, Mangwon Hangang Park, Nanji Hangang Park, Banpo Hangang Park, Ttukseom Hangang Park and Jamsil Hangang Park. The Seoul National Capital Area also contains a green belt aimed at preventing the city from sprawling out into neighboring Gyeonggi Province. These areas are frequently sought after by people looking to escape from urban life on weekends and during vacations.\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

The full metropolitan area, the Southeastern Maritime Industrial Region, has a population of approximately 8 million.[8] The most densely built-up areas of the city are situated in a number of narrow valleys between the Nakdong and the Suyeong Rivers, with mountains separating most of the districts. The Nakdong River is Korea's longest river and Busan's Haeundae Beach is also the country's largest.\n\n\nBusan is a center for international conventions, hosting an APEC summit in 2005. It is also a center for sports tournaments in Korea, having hosted the 2002 Asian Games and FIFA World Cup. It is home to the world's largest department store, the Shinsegae Centum City.[9] Busan was added to the UNESCO Creative Cities Network as a \"City of Film\" in December 2014.[10]\n\n\n\n\n## Names[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n## Festivals and events[edit]\n\n\nBusan celebrates festivals all year round.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Station or Newspaper\n | Types\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Busan KBS\n | TV, Radio\n |\n| Busan MBC\n | TV, Radio\n |\n| KNN | TV, Radio\n |\n| Busan CBS\n | Radio\n |\n| Busan BBS\n | Radio\n |\n| Busan eFM\n | Radio (English, Chinese)\n |\n| Busan PBC\n | Radio\n |\n| Busan Ilbo\n | Daily Newspaper\n |\n| Kookje Shinmun\n | Daily Newspaper\n |\n\n\n### In popular culture[edit]\n\n\nAlthough Seoul remains the de facto film and television capital of South Korea, Busan shares more in common with Cannes, France than just its reputation as seaside resort town.[53]\n\n\nThe Busan International Film Festival is often referred to as the \"Cannes of Asia\", attracting thousands of entertainment personalities from both Eastern and Western cinema every year, honoring and recognizing international luminaries such as Mike Leigh, Sh\u014dhei Imamura, Wong Kar-wai, and Kim Ki-duk.[54][55]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n66. **^** \"Busan Motor Show\".

Today, about 3 million people live in the city, making it South Korea's third-most-populous city after Seoul and Busan.[3]\n\n\nThe city's growth has been assured in modern times with the development of its port due to its natural advantages as a coastal city and its proximity to the South Korean capital.

Incheon was the site of the Battle of Inchon when the United States troops landed to relieve pressure on the Pusan Perimeter and to launch a United Nations offensive northward. The result was a decisive UN victory and it was recaptured on 19 September 1950.[8] USS\u00a0*Inchon* was named after the tide-turning battle that ensued.\n\n\nPrior to and during the June Democratic Movement in 1987, Incheon was the site of several pro-democracy protests. \n\n\nIncheon has also hosted a series of major international events. The Global Fair & Festival 2009 Incheon was held in the Songdo District in August 2009. It was open from 7 August to 25 October for a period of 80 days. It was a comprehensive international event with global institutions and corporations as participants. Various musicians and artists performed during the event.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs an international city, Incheon has held numerous large-scale international conferences, such as the Incheon Global Fair & Festival in 2009. The 17th Asian Games Incheon 2014 was also held in Incheon on 19 September 2014. Incheon has established itself[*clarification needed*] as a major transportation hub in northeast Asia with the Incheon International Airport and Incheon Port.[*citation needed*] The large volume of port traffic makes Incheon a Large-Port Metropolis using the Southampton System of Port-City classification.[4]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Ara Canal is a waterway connecting the Han River and the Yellow Sea.

As a tribute to the wall, streets that now run where the wall once stood have been named Bukseongno, Namseongno, Dongseongno and Seoseongno, which translates as \"north fortress street\", \"south fortress street\", \"east fortress street\" and \"west fortress street\" respectively.\n\n\n\n![](image)\n{| style=\"width:.5ex;margin:2px;padding:1px;border:1px solid #000000;\"\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n|\u5927\u00a0\u00b7\u90b1\n|\n\n\n\n|} Emblem of Taikyu-fu (Daegu Prefecture), when Daegu was under Japanese rule\n![](image)\nDaegu Metropolitan City Characters\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn August 25 through August 31, 2008, Daegu hosted the first ever Asian Bodypainting Festival, a sister event of the World Bodypainting Festival in Seeboden, Austria.\n\n\nEach year the city is home to the Daegu International Jazz Festival: http://www.dijf.or.kr/\n\n\nEvery May the \"Colorful Daegu Festival\" offers performances and art programs including the Colorful Parade.[42] In July, the Daegu Chimac Festival takes place at Duryu Park in Dalseo-gu, Daegu. The term \"chimac\" is a portmanteau of chicken and maekju (meaning \"beer\"). There were over 880,000 visitors in 2015, and one million visitors during the festival in 2016.[43]\n\n\n\n### Daegu 12 Views Gallery[edit]\n\n\nThe 12 scenic spots of Daegu selected by Daegu Metropolitan City include Palgongsan Mountain, Biseulsan Mountain, Gangjeong Goryeongbo (The Ark), Sincheon, Suseongmot Lake, Dalseongtoseong Fortress, Gyeongsang Gamyeong Park, National Debt Compensation Memorial Park, Dongseongro, Seomun Market, and Daegu Stadium. \n\n\n\n* ![1st view Palgongsan](image)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Dalgubeol-daejong, a city bell at the Gukchae Bosang Park\n![](image)Daegu Botanical Garden bridge\nMt. Palgong, Mt. Biseul, and Mt. Ap are the representative mountains in Daegu. Apsan, just in the southern part of the city, is the closest mountain from the urban area among them. It has many trails, Buddhist temples, a Korean War museum, and a gondola ride to the peak. Additionally, Waryongsan, Hamjisan, and Yongjibong are located in the city. These serve as neighborhood parks to the citizens. Mt. Palgong has a cable car to the summit.[40] There are also hiking trails in the direction of the Donghwasa Temple and Sutaegol Valley.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Daegu skyline as seen from KNU's Technopark\nGenerally, Daegu is known as a conservative city. As well as being the largest inland city in the country beside Seoul it has become one of the major metropolitan areas in the nation. Traditionally, Buddhism has been strong; today there are still many temples. Confucianism is also popular in Daegu, with a large academy based in the city. Neon cross-topped spires of Christian churches can also be seen in the city.\n\n\n\n### Sights[edit]\n\n\nThe most well-known sight of the city is the stone Buddha called Gatbawi on the top of Gwanbong, Palgongsan. It is famous for its stone gat (Korean traditional hat). People from all over the country visit the place, because they believe that the Buddha will grant one's single desire.[38] Administratively, the site itself is located in the neighboring city, Gyeongsan, Gyeongbuk.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the urban area, several small mountains and hills play the same role. Dalseong Park, which sits inside a 1,500-year-old earth fortress, is a historic place of the city. It contains the city's only zoo and some monuments as well as the wall. Duryu Park or Duryusan is a large forest in the middle of the urban area. It has Daegu Tower, Woobang Land, Kolon Bandstand, Duryu Stadium, and many sports facilities. Daegu Tower, also called Woobang Tower or Duryu Tower, is the tallest contemporary structure (202 m) and a symbol of the city. Its observatory commands good views of the surroundings. Woobang Land is the largest amusement park out of the capital area. Many small gardens lie in the heart of the city, such as the National Debt Repayment Movement Memorial Park (Gukchae Bosang Park) and 2\u00b728 Park. The former park includes Dalgubeol-daejong (\ub2ec\uad6c\ubc8c\ub300\uc885, \u9054\u53e5\u4f10\u5927\u9418), which means the Dalgubeol grand bell. The bell is struck every week and year. There is also a botanical garden with a variety of plants and flowers.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMetropolitan City in Yeongnam, South Korea\n\nThis article is about the city.

A Confucian ritual ceremony called *Seokjeondaeje* is held at Daegu-hyanggyo every spring and autumn. The Yangnyeongsi herb medical festival and Otgol village festival are the contemporary festivals about traditional culture.\n\n\nLately in the city, enthusiasm about performing arts is growing and the local government is trying to meet its demand. Daegu International Opera Festival (DIOF) in October since 2003, Daegu International Musical Festival (DIMF), and Daegu International Bodypainting Festival (DIBF) are three of the most famous festivals on each field in Korea, although those have short histories.\n\n\nVarious festivals in various themes like the Colorful Daegu Festival, Dongseongno festival, Palgongsan maple festival, Biseulsan azalea festival, Korea in Motion Daegu, and so on, are held by the city, each ward, or the specific groups, all through the year.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)DGB Daegu Bank Park\nDaegu Football Club was founded as a community club at the end of 2002, and made their K League debut in 2003. Historically, Daegu have often placed in the lower reaches of the K League. Their best season to date has been 2021, when they finished third out of twelve teams. They were also the winners of the Korean FA Cup in 2018, which qualified the club for their first appearance in the AFC Champions League the following year. The club has since played in the 2021 and 2022 editions of AFC Champions League.\n\n\n\n### Media[edit]\n\n\nThere are three terrestrial TV broadcasting stations in the city: KBS Daegu Broadcast Station, Daegu MBC, and TBC. These are affiliated companies of central broadcasting stations in Seoul just like other local broadcasting companies in South Korea. TBC (Taegu Broadcasting Corporation) depends on SBS. They cover to Gyeongsangbuk-do out of the city. Each television broadcasting company has its own radio station as well.\n\n\n\n### International Daegu[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Average precipitation days (\u2265 0.1 mm) | 2.9\n | 3.5\n | 5.8\n | 6.8\n | 6.9\n | 8.3\n | 12.3\n | 12.1\n | 8.0\n | 4.9\n | 4.8\n | 2.9\n | 79.2\n |\n| Source: Korea Meteorological Administration[32] |\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Daegu Metro Line 3.\nDaegu is a manufacturing industry city. The major industries are textiles, metals and machinery. In the year 2021, Daegu had a regional GDP of $44,144 million. Many companies such as Daegu Bank, Korea Delphi, Hwasung corp., and TaeguTec are situated in this city, and Samsung and Kolon were founded here. Numerous factories are located in the industrial complexes situated in the west and north sides of the city including the Seongseo Industrial Complex, West Daegu Industrial Complex and the Daegu Dyeing Industrial Complex.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAdditionally, Daegu was considered the third major economic city in Korea, after Seoul and Busan. However, due to the decline of the textile industry, which is the heart of Daegu's economy, the overall economic growth of the city has also fallen.\n\n\nAlso, the city is the warmest region in South Korea due to the humid subtropical climate. This climate condition provides the region with high quality apples and oriental melons. The fruit industry is a crucial support for the local economy. Due to the stagnant economy, Daegu's population began to decrease after 2003. Recently, the local government has begun focusing on working towards economic revival and concentrating on improving the city's fashion industry.\n\n\n\n![](image)Daegu International Future Auto EXPO 2017\n![](image)Korean ICT Convergence Expo\n![](image)Korean Brain Research Center - Advanced Equipment Center\n![](image)2017 Green Energy Expo\n### Fashion industry[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n1st view Palgongsan\n* ![2nd view of Biseulsan](image)\n\n2nd view of Biseulsan\n* ![3rd view Gangjeong Goryeong Weir (The Arc)](image)\n\n3rd view Gangjeong Goryeong Weir (The Ark)\n* ![4 Scenic Sincheon](image)\n\n4th Scenic Sincheon\n* ![5 Scenic Spots Suseongmot Lake](image)\n\n5th Scenic Spots Suseongmot Lake\n* ![6 Scenic Dalseongtoseong Fortress](image)\n\n6th Dalseongtoseong Fortress\n* ![7 Scenic Gyeongsang Gamyeong Park](image)\n\n7th Gyeongsang Gamyeong Park\n* ![8th National Debt Compensation Memorial Park](image)\n\n8th Scenic Spots: National Debt Compensation Memorial Park\n* ![9th view Dongseongro](image)\n\n9th view Dongseongro\n* ![10th Seomun Market](image)\n\n10th Seomun Market\n* ![11th Scenery 83 Tower](image)\n\n11th Scenery 83 Tower\n* ![12th view Daegu Stadium](image)\n\n12th view Daegu Stadium\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nDaegu cuisine is similar to that consumed in the Yeongnam region.

Three rivers run through the center of the city: Gapcheon (\uac11\ucc9c), Yudeungcheon (\uc720\ub4f1\ucc9c), and Daejeoncheon (\ub300\uc804\ucc9c). These flow roughly from south to north, eventually joining the Geum River which borders the city on the northeast. The river changes direction after leaving Daejeon, turning to the southwest and eventually emptying into the Yellow Sea near Gunsan.[22]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  Daejeon\n |\n| --- |\n| Climate chart (explanation) |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)People take a foot bath at an outdoor public hot spring in Yuseong-gu, Daejeon, Korea\nDaejeon is the fifth most populous city in Korea, with 1,467,468 registered residents as of 2023.

It was occupied and in use as strategic military ground in various times by people such as the *Usul-gun* of Baekje, *Bipung-gun* of Silla, and the *Hoideok-hyeon*, *Yuseong-hyeon*, *Deokjin-hyeon*, and *Jinjam-hyeon*. During the Joseon Kingdom period, it remained occupied by the *Hoideok-hyeon* and *Jinjam-hyeon* of Gongju Mokha. In 1895, most of the area was made part of Hoideok-gun and Jinjam-gun, excluding some parts that belonged to Gongju-gun.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Emblem of Taidenfu (Daejeonbu), the administrative division that existed during Japanese rule of Daejeon\nIn 1932, the capital of South Chungcheong Province was moved from Gongju to Daejeon. During the Korean War, the city was the site of an early major conflict: the Battle of Taejon. Also during the war, the mass graves of civilians killed by South Korean police were discovered near Taejon and reported on by Alan Winnington in his famous anti-war leaflet \"I Saw Truth in Korea\".[17][18] Embarrassed by the contents of the leaflet, the British government considered having him executed for treason, though instead decided to make him stateless.[19][20]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This article **needs additional citations for verification**.

Travel time between Daejeon and Seoul using the KTX high-speed rail system is about 50 minutes. The nearest airport to Daejeon is Cheongju Airport, about a thirty-minute drive north of Daejeon.

In addition to KAIST and the Institute for Basic Science, it is home to more than 20 other government research institutions, and various corporate research centers, mostly located around Daedeok Innopolis in Yuseong District north of the Gapcheon river.[35][36]\n\n\n\nFields of research undertaken in Daejeon include telecommunications, nanofabrication, biotechnology, water, nuclear and hydro power, nuclear fusion, design, measurement technologies, mechanical engineering, fuel cells, aeronautics, new materials, robotics, new drugs, and environmental technologies. Daedeok Innopolis' membership includes 898 corporations, 35 government-invested and sponsored institutions; six universities, and 15 public organizations.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Daejeon area was historically known as *Hanbat* (\ud55c\ubc2d),[14] a native Korean term for \"large field\", during the Joseon Dynasty. \"Daejeon\" simply means the same thing in Hanja. In the 19th century, Daejeon was also known in English as Kung-tsiou.[15]\n\n\nHistorically, Daejeon was a small village without many residents. However, in 1905, the Gyeongbu Railway began operations from Seoul to Busan, opening a station at Daejeon. In 1926 under the rule of the Japanese government, the Honam Railway was built between Mokpo and Daejeon, transforming the latter into a major transportation hub. Because of its location and proximity to means of transportation, Daejeon grew quickly.[9]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPublic corporation research institutes such as Korea Electric Power Research Institute (hydroelectric projects and nuclear energy), Korea Institute of Construction Materials (authorized test agency for construction materials), and Korea Institute of Aerospace Technology (aerospace design, satellites, launch technologies) are also part of the Daedeok system.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nOn 16 May 2013, Daejeon was selected as the core of the International Science and Business Belt.

It is a designated metropolitan city under the direct control of the central government's Home Minister. The city was also the capital of South Jeolla Province until the provincial office moved to the southern village of Namak in Muan County in 2005 because Gwangju was promoted to a metropolitan city and was independent of South Jeolla province.\n\n\nIts name is composed of the words *Gwang* (Korean:\u00a0\uad11; Hanja:\u00a0\u5149) meaning \"light\" and *Ju* (\uc8fc; \u5dde) meaning \"province\". Gwangju was historically recorded as *Muju* (\ubb34\uc8fc; \u6b66\u5dde), in which \"Silla merged all of the land to establish the provinces of Gwangju, Ungju, Jeonju, Muju and various counties, plus the southern boundary of Goguryeo and the ancient territories of Silla\" in the *Samguk Sagi.*[3] In the heart of the agricultural Jeolla region, the city is also famous for its rich and diverse cuisine.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Gwangju Hyanggyo (Confucian School) \u2013 Gwangju Hyanggyo is in the Gwangju Park in Sa-dong.

It was one of the administrative centers of Baekje during the Three Kingdoms Period.[4]\n\n\nIn 1929, during the period of Imperial Japanese rule, a confrontation between Korean and Japanese students in the city turned into Gwangju Student Independence Movement, a regional demonstration, which culminated in one of the major nationwide uprisings against Imperial Japanese cruelty during the colonial period.\n\n\nThe modern industry was established in Gwangju with the construction of a railway to Seoul. Some of the industries that took hold include cotton textiles, rice mills and breweries. Construction of a designated industrial zone in 1967 encouraged growth in industry, especially in the sectors linked to the automobile industry.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\"Climatological Normals of Korea\" (PDF).
