Beck's album *Morning Phase* was named Album of the Year. This prompted Kanye West, who later said he thought Beyonc\u00e9 should have won, to jokingly leap onstage to interrupt Beck in a re-enactment of his 2009 MTV VMA scandal, but West left the stage without saying anything.[4] Both Pharrell Williams and Beyonc\u00e9 took three honors; with her wins, Beyonc\u00e9 became the second-most-honored female musician in Grammy history following Alison Krauss.

Interscope would eventually go on to manage her for a brief period of time.[16][15] It was during this time that she adopted her stage name, which she created from the name of her childhood dog, Iggy, and the street she grew up on, Azalea Street, where her family lives to this day.[23] She also started making stop motion animated videos with freestyle rap because she felt like she had found her sound.[24]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n7. **^** Trust, Gary (20 August 2014). \"Ariana Grande, Iggy Azalea Triple Up in Hot 100's Top 10, MAGIC!

It played an important role in the internal conflicts of France and for most of its history was used as a state prison by the kings of France. It was stormed by a crowd on 14 July 1789, in the French Revolution, becoming an important symbol for the French Republican movement. It was later demolished and replaced by the Place de la Bastille.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn July 14, the Bastille was stormed by a revolutionary crowd, primarily residents of the Faubourg Saint-Antoine who sought to commandeer the valuable gunpowder held within the fortress. Seven remaining prisoners were found and released and the Bastille's governor, Bernard-Ren\u00e9 de Launay, was killed by the crowd. The Bastille was demolished by order of the Committee of the H\u00f4tel de Ville. Souvenirs of the fortress were transported around France and displayed as icons of the overthrow of despotism. Over the next century, the site and historical legacy of the Bastille featured prominently in French revolutions, political protests and popular fiction, and it remained an important symbol for the French Republican movement.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 1889 the continued popularity of the Bastille with the public was illustrated by the decision to build a replica in stone and wood for the Exposition Universelle world fair in Paris, manned by actors in period costumes.[223]\n\n\nDue in part to the diffusion of national and Republican ideas across France during the second half of the Third Republic, the Bastille lost an element of its prominence as a symbol by the 20th century.[224] Nonetheless, the Place de la Bastille continued to be the traditional location for left wing rallies, particularly in the 1930s, the symbol of the Bastille was widely evoked by the French Resistance during the Second World War and until the 1950s Bastille Day remained the single most significant French national holiday.[225]\n\n\n\n## Remains[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFormer Parisian fortress\n\nThis article is about the building in Paris.

Construction was underway by 1357, but the main construction occurred from 1370 onwards, creating a strong fortress with eight towers that protected the strategic gateway of the Porte Saint-Antoine heading out to the east. The innovative design proved influential in both France and England and was widely copied. The Bastille figured prominently in France's domestic conflicts, including the fighting between the rival factions of the Burgundians and the Armagnacs in the 15th century, and the Wars of Religion in the 16th. The fortress was declared a state prison in 1417; this role was expanded further, first under the English occupiers of the 1420s and 1430s, and then under Louis XI in the 1460s. The defences of the Bastille were fortified in response to the Imperial threat during the 1550s, with a bastion constructed to the east of the fortress. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Charpentier, Fran\u00e7ois (1789). *La Bastille d\u00e9voil\u00e9e, ou, Recueil de pi\u00e8ces authentiques pour servir a son histoire.* Paris: Chez Desenne.

When Henry clamped down on a Spanish-backed plot among the senior French nobility in 1602, for example, he detained the ringleader Charles de Gontaut, duc de Biron, in the Bastille, and had him executed in the courtyard.[47] Louis XIII's chief minister, Cardinal Richelieu, is credited with beginning the modern transformation of the Bastille into a more formal organ of the French state, further increasing its structured use as a state prison.[48] Richelieu broke with Henry IV's tradition of the Bastille's captain being a member of the French aristocracy, typically a Marshal of France such as Fran\u00e7ois de Bassompierre, Charles d'Albert or Nicolas de L'Hospital, and instead appointed P\u00e8re Joseph's brother to run the facility.[49][E] The first surviving documentary records of prisoners at the Bastille also date from this period.[51]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWithin hours of its capture the Bastille began to be used as a powerful symbol to give legitimacy to the revolutionary movement in France.[186] The faubourg Saint-Antoine's revolutionary reputation was firmly established by their storming of the Bastille and a formal list began to be drawn up of the \"vainqueurs\" who had taken part so as to honor both the fallen and the survivors.[187] Although the crowd had initially gone to the Bastille searching for gunpowder, historian Simon Schama observes how the captured prison \"gave a shape and an image to all the vices against which the Revolution defined itself\".[188] Indeed, the more despotic and evil the Bastille was portrayed by the pro-revolutionary press, the more necessary and justified the actions of the Revolution became.[188] Consequently, the late governor, de Launay, was rapidly vilified as a brutal despot.[189] The fortress itself was described by the revolutionary press as a \"place of slavery and horror\", containing \"machines of death\", \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAlmost nothing is left of the Bastille, except some remains of its stone foundation that were relocated to the side of Boulevard Henri IV. Historians were critical of the Bastille in the early 19th century, and believe the fortress to have been a relatively well-administered example of French policing and political control during the 18th century.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### 14th century[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nthe Bastille became an underground symbol for Republicans.[211] The July Revolution in 1830 used images such as the Bastille to legitimise their new regime and in 1833, the former site of the Bastille was used to build the July Column to commemorate the revolution.[213] The short-lived Second Republic was symbolically declared in 1848 on the former revolutionary site.[214]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Bastille remained a powerful and evocative symbol for French republicans throughout the 19th century.[210] Napoleon Bonaparte overthrew the French First Republic that emerged from the Revolution in 1799, and subsequently attempted to marginalise the Bastille as a symbol.[211] Napoleon was unhappy with the revolutionary connotations of the Place de la Bastille, and initially considered building his Arc de Triomphe on the site instead.[212] This proved an unpopular option, and so instead he planned the construction of a huge bronze statue of an imperial elephant.[212] The project was delayed, eventually indefinitely, and all that was constructed was a large plaster version of the bronze statue, which stood on the former site of the Bastille between 1814 and 1846, when the decaying structure was finally removed.[212] After the restoration of the French Bourbon monarchy in 1815, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSome relics of the Bastille survive: the Carnavalet Museum holds objects including one of the stone models of the Bastille made by Palloy and the rope ladder used by Latude to escape from the prison roof in the 18th century, while the mechanism and bells of the prison clock are exhibited in Mus\u00e9e Europ\u00e9en d'Art Campanaire at L'Isle-Jourdain.[228] The key to the Bastille was given to George Washington in 1790 by Lafayette and is displayed in the historic house of Mount Vernon.[229] The Bastille's archives are now held by the Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France.[230]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Toy, Sidney (1985). *Castles: Their Construction and History*.

For comparison, 1,200 livres was around 0.8% of the French Crown's annual income from royal taxes in 1460.[30]\n5. **^** In practice, Henry IV's nobles appointed lieuentants to actually run the fortress.[50]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nLouis XIV used the Bastille as a prison for upper-class members of French society who had opposed or angered him including, after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, French Protestants. From 1659 onwards, the Bastille functioned primarily as a state penitentiary; by 1789, 5,279 prisoners had passed through its gates. Under Louis XV and XVI, the Bastille was used to detain prisoners from more varied backgrounds, and to support the operations of the Parisian police, especially in enforcing government censorship of the printed media. Although inmates were kept in relatively good conditions, criticism of the Bastille grew during the 18th century, fueled by autobiographies written by former prisoners. Reforms were implemented and prisoner numbers were considerably reduced. In 1789, the royal government's financial crisis and the formation of the National Assembly gave rise to a swelling of republican sentiments among city-dwellers. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMeanwhile, the legacy of the Bastille proved popular among French novelists. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the 1970s French sociologists, particularly those interested in critical theory, re-examined this historical legacy.[232] The Annales School conducted extensive research into how order was maintained in pre-revolutionary France, focusing on the operation of the police, concepts of deviancy and religion.[232] Histories of the Bastille since then have focused on the prison's role in policing, censorship and popular culture, in particular how these impacted on the working classes.[232] Research in West Germany during the 1980s examined the cultural interpretation of the Bastille against the wider context of the French Revolution; Hanse L\u00fcsebrink and Rolf Reichardt's work, explaining how the Bastille came to be regarded as a symbol of despotism, was among the most prominent.[244] This body of work influenced English historian Simon Schama's 1989 book on the Revolution, \n</fragment>\n</document>",

The two elder sisters, Este and Danielle, performed briefly with the pop group Valli Girls in 2005, releasing a few songs on soundtrack and compilation albums under that name. In 2007, they formed Haim with younger sister Alana, but did not seriously consider it a professional career for some years. After Danielle became a successful touring guitarist, first with Jenny Lewis and later with Julian Casablancas, Haim reformed as a full-time operation in 2012.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs they grew older, the sisters became more interested in incorporating pop and contemporary R&B into their music, and in 2007 they decided to form their own band.[8] For their first gig, the trio played at a Jewish deli in Hollywood and were paid in matzah ball soup.[15] Early gigs were sparsely populated; Danielle recalled, \"We were [at the] bottom of the bill at 50-capacity venues and no one would show up\".[16] For the next five years, Haim played local venues but did not consider music as a professional career, because all three sisters were busy with other projects. Este was studying at UCLA and graduated in 2010 with a degree in ethnomusicology,[9][12][17][18] specializing in Bulgarian and Brazilian music.[12] Alana attended Los Angeles County High School for the Arts and graduated in 2010.[19][20]\n\n\n\n### Danielle Haim's guest appearances[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
