It saw heavy fighting across Europe for almost six years, starting with Germany's invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939 and ending with the Western Allies conquering most of Western Europe, the Soviet Union conquering most of Eastern Europe including the German capital Berlin, and Germany's unconditional surrender on 8 May 1945[nb 24] although fighting continued elsewhere in Europe until 25 May. On 5 June 1945, the Berlin Declaration proclaiming the unconditional surrender of Germany to the four victorious powers was signed. The Allied powers fought the Axis powers on two major fronts (Eastern Front and Western Front), but there were other fronts varying in scale from the Italian campaign (the 3rd largest campaign in Europe), to the Polish Campaign, as well as in a strategic bombing offensive and in the adjoining Mediterranean and Middle East theatre.\n\n\n\n\n## Preceding events[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| European theatre of World War II |\n| --- |\n| Part of World War II |\n| ![](image)**From left to right, top to bottom*** German Stuka dive bombers on the Eastern Front, 1943 \u2022 German soldiers take position near a Sturmgesch\u00fctz III on the Eastern Front, 1942 \u2022 American soldiers during the Italian campaign, 1943 \u2022 German Junkers Ju 87 dive bomber over Stalingrad, 1942 .

A firestorm was created in the city, and between 18,000 and 25,000 people were killed.[32][33][34] Only the Hamburg attack, the 9\u201310 March 1945 firebombing of Tokyo and the nuclear attacks on Hiroshima (6 August 1945) and Nagasaki (9 August 1945) killed more people through a single attack.\n\n\n\n## Mediterranean and other European countries[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Mediterranean and Middle East theatre of World War II and World War II in Yugoslavia\n\n![](image)Partisan liberated territory in Yugoslavia, May 1943\nThe Mediterranean and Middle East theatre was a major theatre of operations during the Second World War. The vast size of this theatre included the fighting between the Allies and Axis in Italy, the Balkans, Southern Europe, Malta, North Africa and the Middle East.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThat changed when Germany mounted a major counteroffensive on 16 December 1944. The Ardennes offensive, also called the Battle of the Bulge, drove back and surrounded some small American units. The Allied forces were eventually successful in driving back Germany, in what turned out to be their last major advance of the war. The battle officially ended on 27 January 1945.\n\n\nThe final obstacle to the Allies was the Rhine. It was crossed in March 1945, and the way lay open to the centre of Germany. The last major German forces in the west were encircled and trapped in the Ruhr.\n\n\n\n## End of the war in Europe[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Winston Churchill waves to crowds in London on Victory in Europe Day.\nMain article: End of World War II in Europe\n\nSee also: Victory in Europe Day, Victory Day (9 May), and Western Front (World War II)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMain articles: Events preceding World War II in Europe and Causes of World War II\n\nGermany was defeated in World War I, and the Treaty of Versailles placed punitive conditions on the country, including significant financial reparations, the loss of territory (some only temporarily), war guilt, military weakening and limitation, and economic weakening. Germany was humiliated in front of the world and had to pay very large war reparations. Many Germans blamed their country's post-war economic collapse on the treaty's conditions and these resentments contributed to the political instability which made it possible for Adolf Hitler and his Nazi Party to come to power.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nCampaigns of World War II\n |\n| --- |\n| **Europe**\n* Poland\n* Phoney War\n* Finland\n\t+ Winter War\n\t+ Karelia\n\t+ Lapland\n* Denmark and Norway\n* Western Front\n\t+ 1940\n\t+ 1944\u20131945\n* Britain\n* Balkans\n* Eastern Front\n* Italy\n\t+ Sicily\n\n\n**Asia-Pacific**\n\n* China\n* Pacific Ocean\n\t+ South West Pacific\n* Franco-Thai War\n* South-East Asia\n* Burma and India\n* Japan\n* Manchuria and Northern Korea\n\t+ pre-war border conflicts\n\n\n**Mediterranean and Middle East**\n\n* Africa\n\t+ North Africa\n\t+ East Africa\n* Mediterranean Sea\n* Adriatic\n* Malta\n* Middle East\n\t+ Iraq\n\t+ Syria\u2013Lebanon\n\t+ Iran\n* Dodecanese\n* Southern France\n\n\n**Other campaigns**\n\n* Americas\n* Atlantic\n* Arctic\n* Strategic bombing\n* French West Africa\n* Indian Ocean\n\t+ Madagascar\n\n\n**Coups**\n\n* Yugoslavia\n* Iraq\n* Italy\n* Romania\n* Bulgaria\n* Hungary\n* French Indochina\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Prelude | * Africa\n\t+ Second Italo-Ethiopian War\n* Asia\n\t+ Second Sino-Japanese War\n\t+ Battles of Khalkhin Gol\n* Europe\n\t+ Anschluss\n\t+ Munich Agreement\n\t+ Occupation of Czechoslovakia\n\t+ Operation Himmler\n\t+ Italian invasion of Albania\n |\n| 1939 | * Invasion of Poland\n* Battle of the Atlantic\n* Phoney War\n* First Battle of Changsha\n* Battle of South Guangxi\n* Winter War\n* 1939\u20131940 Winter Offensive\n |\n| 1940 | * Norwegian campaign\n* German invasion of Denmark\n* Battle of Zaoyang\u2013Yichang\n* German invasion of Luxembourg\n* German invasion of the Netherlands\n* German invasion of Belgium\n* Battle of France\n* Dunkirk evacuation\n* Battle of Britain\n* Battle of the Mediterranean\n* North Africa\n* West Africa\n* British Somaliland\n* Hundred Regiments Offensive\n* Baltic states\n* Eastern Romania\n* Japanese invasion of French Indochina\n* Italian invasion of Greece\n* *Compass*\n |\n| 1941 | * Battle of South Henan\n* Battle of Shanggao\n* Invasion of Yugoslavia\n* German invasion of Greece\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Indonesian National Revolution\n* *Keelhaul*\n* Marshall Plan\n* Occupation of Germany\n* Occupation of Japan\n* *Osoaviakhim*\n* *Paperclip*\n* Soviet occupations\n\t+ Baltic\n\t+ Hungary\n\t+ Poland\n\t+ Romania\n* Territorial changes of Germany\n* Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany\n* United Nations\n |\n| War crimes | * Allied war crimes\n\t+ Soviet war crimes\n\t+ British war crimes\n\t+ United States war crimes\n* German war crimes\n\t+ forced labour\n\t+ Wehrmacht war crimes\n\t+ The Holocaust\n\t\t- Aftermath\n\t\t- Response\n\t+ Nuremberg trials\n* Italian war crimes\n* Japanese war crimes\n\t+ Nanjing Massacre\n\t+ Unit 731\n\t+ Prosecution\n* Croatian war crimes\n\t+ Genocide of Serbs\n\t+ Persecution of Jews\n* Romanian war crimes\n* Sexual violence\n\t+ German military brothels\n\t+ Camp brothels\n\t+ Rape during the occupation of Germany \u00a0/ Japan \u00a0/ Poland\n\t+ Rape during the liberation of France \u00a0/ Serbia\n\t+ Sook Ching\n\t+ Comfort women\n\t+ Rape of Manila\n\t+ Marocchinate\n |\n\n |\n| Participants | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Dutch famine of 1944\u20131945\n |\n| 1945 | * Vistula\u2013Oder\n* Battle of Manila\n* Battle of Iwo Jima\n* Indochina\n* Vienna offensive\n* Project Hula\n* Western invasion of Germany\n* Bratislava\u2013Brno offensive\n* Battle of Okinawa\n* Second Guangxi campaign\n* West Hunan\n* Italy (Spring 1945)\n* Battle of Berlin\n* Prague offensive\n* Surrender of Germany\n\t+ document\n* Borneo\n* Taipei\n* Naval bombardment of Japan\n* Manchuria\n* Atomic bombings\n\t+ Debate\n* South Sakhalin\n* Kuril Islands\n\t+ Shumshu\n* Surrender of Japan\n\t+ Potsdam Declaration\n\t+ document\n\t+ End of World War II in Asia\n |\n\n |\n| * **![](image) World portal**\n* Bibliography\n* Category\n |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Authority control databases: National ![Edit this at Wikidata](image) | * Israel\n* United States\n |\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Finland does not enter the war with the Soviet Union unless attacked.[1]\n\n\nIn all scenarios, the United States always enters the war in 1942, even if the UK has been eliminated.[1]\n\n\n\n### Other rules[edit]\n\n\nThere are many rules dealing with unique situations in each country that further complicate the game.[1]\n\n\n\n### Reception[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n1973 board wargame\n\n  \n\n***World War II: European Theater of Operations*** is the title of two related but dissimilar board wargames that simulate the European Theater of World War II. The first was published by Simulations Publications Inc. (SPI) in 1973, and the second by TSR in 1985 following its takeover of SPI.\n\n\n\n\n## Publication history[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* The Allies receive amphibious transports automatically in 1942, 1943 and 1944. (The units are sent to the Pacific Theater in 1945.)\n* The Germans must build amphibious transports, using four replacement factors to build each one. They cannot be used tin the Mediterranean, and can be converted to naval transports after being used in an amphibious role.\n\n\n### Air Power[edit]\n\n\nAir power for the US, the UK and Germany is abstractly represented: when a naval transport passes within two hexes of an enemy unit, a die is rolled. If the result is a 6, the naval transport must return to its starting hex.[1]\n\n\nDuring an amphibious invasion, the area must be clear of two-hex enemy air zones; if not, then the air powers of the invader and defender must contest the air space.[1]\n\n\n\n### Scenarios[edit]\n\n\nThe SPI edition comes with three scenarios which all run from the scenario's starting date until mid-1945:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn Issue 12 of *Moves*, Christopher J. Allen called *World War II* \"a hell of a good game\" but warned that \"it is more complex than this article might lead one to believe.. There are many secondary rules ... which are vital to the play of the game.\" Allen also pointed out that the game was unbalanced in favor of the Allies, stating, \"Given two equal players, the Axis will almost always lose. He can win, but only if he makes no mistakes and has a bit of luck to boot.\" Allen noted that this imbalance did not occur in the three-player version of the game, saying \"in the three-player game, anything can happen.\" Allen concluded, \"Playing *World War II* is like jumping into cold water \u2014 it takes a little getting used to, but then you love it.\"[1]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1990, TSR published a revised and expanded second edition, but identified by the old SPI marque rather than the TSR trademark. The following year, TSR published a companion wargame *World War II: Pacific Theater of Operations* that could be combined with *European Theater of Operations* to create a grand strategic game of the entire war.\n\n\nFurther revised and expanded editions were published by Decision Games: *World War II: Advanced European Theatre of Operations* (2001), *World War II: Advanced Pacific Theatre of Operations* (2009) as well as an expansion kit *World War II: Advanced European Theatre of Operations: Africa Orientale Italiana* (2009), covering Mussolini's invasion of Abyssinia in 1935 and the British reconquest in 1941.\n\n\n\n![](image)SPI edition, 1973\n## SPI edition, 1973[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Weather\n* Strategic Warfare\n* Naval and Air Phase\n* Offensive Phase, subdivided into regular combat, breakthroughs, and exploitation attacks\n* Movement Phase\n* End Phase\n\n\nThe Allied player then has the same opportunity, completing the monthly Game Turn.\n\n\nUnits counters have a full-strength side, with half strength statistics printed on the back. Using \"step reduction\" rules, each unit is flipped over to the half-strength side after taking damage, and is eliminated on a second hit. \n\n\nLeaders and headquarters, which have their own counters, play an important part in offensives.\n\n\n\n### Scenarios[edit]\n\n\nThe TSR edition offers six scenarios:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1969, Jim Dunnigan formed Poultron Press \u2014 soon to be known as Simulations Publications \u2014 in order to save the faltering wargame magazine *Strategy & Tactics*, and to publish wargames. Dunnigan used the magazine to gather readers' feedback for future projects. At the time there were several board wargames on the market that simulated various parts of World War II such as *Afrika Korps* (Avalon Hill, 1964), and *Anzio* (Avalon Hill, 1968). In Issue 21 of *Strategy & Tactics* (March 1970), many readers asked if the piecemeal European campaign games could be combined into one game that simulated the entire European theater.[1] After a delay due to other projects, Dunnigan responded by designing *World War II: European Theater of Operations 1939\u20131945* with rules based on *Barbarossa*, a popular wargame he had previously designed.[1]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn *The Guide to Simulations/Games for Education and Training*, Martin Campion commented that the SPI edition \"shows a great deal about the strategic options in World War II. It also clearly shows how the German invasion of Russia closed off most of those options for Hitler and became the dominating factor in the war.\" Campion, a history professor, believed the game \"should be useful in a class because its complexity can be broken into many parts and parcelled out to the class members.\" However, he noted the need for the teacher to act as an impartial referee since \"Some of the rules are ambiguous and others too rigid ... The teacher should improvise to keep the game on a realistic track.\"[3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn Issue 3 of *Strategy Plus*, Jonathan Turner found the long rule book of the TSR edition \"clear, well laid out and allows play with the minimal amount of homework.\" Turner liked the first three scenarios that he felt allowed the players to come to grips with the complex game, but commented \"the feel of the game is particularly impressive when one finally graduates to the major scenarios.\" Turner admitted that the game was so large that \"it is difficult to do this game justice. The extraordinary aspect is that play of it is so smooth under the weight of all the chrome.\" Turner concluded, \"*World War Two: European Theatre of Operations* is an excellent game for the adamantine hardcore gamer ... This could be just what we were all looking for to fill the odd idle decade when we don\u2019t have anything better to do. \"[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* *The Wargamer* Vol.1 #46\n* *JagdPanther* #5\n* *Campaign* #85\n* *Panzerfaust* #64\n* *The Playboy Winner's Guide to Board Games*[6]\n\n\n![](image)TSR edition, 1985\n## TSR edition, 1985[edit]\n\n\nThe TSR edition has a completely new set of rules in a 32-page rulebook, 800 counters and two large 22\" x 32\" maps, making it much larger and more complex than the SPI version.\n\n\n\n### Gameplay[edit]\n\n\nEach game turn represents one month. At the start of each new three-month season (winter, spring, summer and fall) a special Seasonal Turn takes place in which players collect income from industry and must pre-pay for offensives that they have planned for the season. Payment for various items vary from country to country. For example, tanks are relatively inexpensive for Germany but naval ships are very expensive. \n\n\nThen for each monthly Game Turn, the Axis player has the following phases, each of which is divided into multiple segments:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe SPI edition is a two-player game of Allies versus Axis forces, although provision has been made for a three-player game where the third player controls the Soviet forces. The game has less than 400 counters, a 12-page rulebook and a single 22\" x 28\" hex grid map covering all of Europe and the Middle East.\n\n\n\n### Gameplay[edit]\n\n\nThe SPI edition uses a simple alternating turn system, where the German player has the following phases:\n\n\n\n* Movement\n* Attack\n* Mechanized Movement: All mechanized units that did not move in first Movement phase can move\n* Rail and Naval Movement\n\n\nThis is followed by administrative phases for reinforcements and partisan creation.\n\n\nThe Allied player then has the same phases, with the addition of Lend-Lease calculations for Russian reinforcements.\n\n\nThe end of the Allied player's turn completes one Game Turn, which represents one season (3 months) of the war.\n\n\n\n### Movement[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1982, TSR unexpectedly took over SPI and made it their wargame publishing subsidiary. TSR reissued several of SPI's more popular games such as *Blue & Gray* without revision. In the case of *World War II*, TSR game designer Jeff Ealy decided that the game needed a complete redesign, and discarded all of Dunnigan's rules.[2] Ealy's revision, published in 1985, was based on very large wargames with economic elements by John Prados such as *Rise and Decline of the Third Reich* (Avalon Hill, 1974) and *Von Manstein: Battles for the Ukraine* (Rand Game Associates, 1975). The result, although identically titled, was a much larger and more complex game than its predecessor.\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Here are some key events:\n\n1. **Invasion of Poland (1 September 1939)**: Germany's invasion of Poland marked the beginning of World War II. This led to Britain and France declaring war on Germany.\n\n2. **Fall of France (May-June 1940)**: Germany launched a blitzkrieg against France, quickly defeating French forces and occupying the country.\n\n3. **Battle of Britain (July-October 1940)**: Germany attempted to gain air superiority over Britain but was ultimately unsuccessful, marking the first major defeat for Hitler's military forces.\n\n4. **Operation Barbarossa (22 June 1941)**: Germany invaded the Soviet Union, leading to some of the largest and deadliest battles in history on the Eastern Front.\n\n5. **D-Day (6 June 1944)**: The Allied forces launched a massive invasion of German-occupied France at Normandy, which was a turning point in the war leading to the liberation of Western Europe.\n\n6. **Battle of the Bulge (16 December 1944 - 25 January 1945)**: Germany's last major offensive in the west aimed to split the Allied forces but ultimately failed.\n\n7. **Fall of Berlin (April-May 1945)**: The Soviet Union captured Berlin, leading to the suicide of Adolf Hitler and the eventual unconditional surrender of Germany on 8 May 1945, known as Victory in Europe (VE) Day.\n\nThese events were part of a broader conflict that included strategic bombing campaigns, the Italian Campaign, and various other military operations across Europe and the Mediterranean. The war in Europe concluded with the signing of the Berlin Declaration on 5 June 1945, marking the unconditional surrender of Germany to the Allied powers.",

It included campaigns fought in the Libyan and Egyptian deserts (Western Desert campaign, also known as the Desert War) and in Morocco and Algeria (Operation Torch), as well as Tunisia (Tunisia campaign). The campaign was fought between the Allies and the Axis Powers. The Allied war effort was dominated by the British Commonwealth and exiles from German-occupied Europe. The United States officially entered the war in December 1941 and began direct military assistance in North Africa on 11 May 1942.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Willmott, H.P. (1984). *June, 1944*.

After Operation Torch, the Anglo-American landings in North-West Africa in November 1942 and fighting against Vichy France forces (which then changed sides), the Allies trapped about 250,000 German and Italian personnel in northern Tunisia, forcing their surrender in May 1943.\n\n\nInformation gleaned via British Ultra code-breaking was important in the Allied victory in North Africa. The Italian campaign followed, which culminated in the downfall of the fascist government in Italy and the elimination of Germany's main European ally. German and Italian forces committed atrocities against prisoners of war and Jewish, Berber and Arab populations.\n\n\n\n\n## Western Desert campaign[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Western Desert campaign\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSee also: Jews outside Europe under Axis occupation\n\nThe North African campaign was often labeled a \"war without hate\", a pure military clash in the desert without the partisan roundups and ethnic cleansing happening in Europe. This view has been challenged by recent historians, given that there were indeed many civilians who lived in the region,[73] and the campaign was marked by numerous atrocities and abuses by both Italian and German forces towards Allied prisoners of war and local Jewish, Berber, and Arab populations.[74] These acts were often motivated by racism and antisemitism.[75]\n\n\n\n## Aftermath[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Wehrmacht fuel barrel in Tunisia, 2010\nAfter victory by the Allies in the North African campaign, the stage was set for the Italian campaign to begin. The invasion of Sicily followed two months later. Nearly 400,000 Axis and Allied troops were lost, injured or died of disease by the end of the North African campaign.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nCampaigns of World\u00a0War\u00a0II\n |\n| --- |\n| **Europe**\n* Poland\n* Phoney War\n* Finland\n\t+ Winter War\n\t+ Karelia\n\t+ Lapland\n* Denmark and Norway\n* Western Front\n\t+ 1940\n\t+ 1944\u20131945\n* Britain\n* Balkans\n* Eastern Front\n* Italy\n\t+ Sicily\n\n\n**Asia-Pacific**\n\n* China\n* Pacific Ocean\n\t+ South West Pacific\n* Franco-Thai War\n* South-East Asia\n* Burma and India\n* Japan\n* Manchuria and Northern Korea\n\t+ pre-war border conflicts\n\n\n**Mediterranean and Middle East**\n\n* Africa\n\t+ North Africa\n\t+ East Africa\n* Mediterranean Sea\n* Adriatic\n* Malta\n* Middle East\n\t+ Iraq\n\t+ Syria\u2013Lebanon\n\t+ Iran\n* Dodecanese\n* Southern France\n\n\n**Other campaigns**\n\n* Americas\n* Atlantic\n* Arctic\n* Strategic bombing\n* French West Africa\n* Indian Ocean\n\t+ Madagascar\n\n\n**Coups**\n\n* Yugoslavia\n* Iraq\n* Italy\n* Romania\n* Bulgaria\n* Hungary\n* French Indochina\n |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nNorth African campaign\n |\n| --- |\n| **Western Desert campaign**\n\n- Invasion of Egypt\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Atkinson, Rick (2004) [2002]. *An Army at Dawn: The War in North Africa, 1942\u20131943*.

The Axis forces drove the Eighth Army back over the Egyptian border, but their advance was stopped in July only 90 miles (140\u00a0km) from Alexandria in the First Battle of El Alamein.\n\n\nOf great significance, on 29 June reports of British military operations in North Africa sent to Washington by the US military attach\u00e9 in Cairo, Bonner Fellers, no longer used the compromised \"Black Code\" which the Axis forces had been reading, so the Axis could no longer learn of British \"strengths, positions, losses, reinforcements, supply, situation, plans, morale etc\" as they had since 1940.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAfter three days of talks and threats, Generals Mark Clark and Dwight Eisenhower compelled Vichy Admiral Fran\u00e7ois Darlan and General Alphonse Juin to order the cessation on 10\u201311 November of armed resistance from Vichy forces in Oran and Morocco, promising to make Darlan the head of a Free French administration.

This was followed by an Italian counter-offensive into Egypt and the capture of Sidi Barrani in September. The British recaptured Sidi Barrani in December during Operation Compass. The Italian 10th Army was destroyed and the German *Afrika Korps* was dispatched to North Africa in February 1941 in Operation Sonnenblume to reinforce Italians and prevent an Axis defeat.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n9. **^** Rochat, Giorgio. *Le guerre italiane 1935\u20131943.

The air campaigns by the Axis forces proved to be a difficult challenge for the British forces. However, the Allies were left with the advantage of having secured the island of Malta, enabling the Allies to carry out future aerial operations. Additionally, on land, allied British and American forces were able to hold onto their possessions. On December 4, 1942, the Allied Force Headquarters in North Africa reported that military operations were ongoing in the Tebourba area. The Axis powers attempted a second counter-attack in the neighborhood of Tebourba following their failed attempt on December 1. The attack was successfully repulsed by the Allied powers, and the enemy sustained significant damage to their weaponry. During the winter, there followed a period of stalemate during which time both sides continued to build up their forces. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBy 16 September, the Italian force had advanced to Maktila, around 130 kilometres (80\u00a0mi) west of Mersa Matruh, where they halted due to supply problems.[21] Despite Mussolini urging them to carry on, Graziani ordered his men to dig in around Sidi Barrani, and fortified camps were established in forward locations; additional troops were also positioned behind the main force.[22] In response to the dispersed Italian camps, the British planned a limited five-day attack, Operation Compass, to strike at these fortified camps one by one.[23][24] The British Commonwealth force, totalling 36,000 men,[25] attacked the forward elements of the 10-division-strong Italian army on 9 December.[26] Following their initial success, the forces of Operation Compass[27] pursued the retreating Italian forces.[28] In January, the small port at Bardia was taken,[29] soon followed by the seizure of the fortified port of Tobruk.[30]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe British Eighth Army bypassed the Axis defence on the Mareth Line in late March after harsh fighting[*citation needed*] and First Army in central Tunisia launched their main offensive in mid-April to squeeze the Axis forces until their resistance in Africa collapsed. The Axis forces surrendered on 13 May 1943 yielding over 275,000 prisoners of war. The last Axis force to surrender in North Africa was the 1st Italian Army of general Messe.[57] This huge loss of experienced troops greatly reduced the military capacity of the Axis powers, although some Axis troops escaped Tunisia. This defeat in Africa led to all Italian colonies in Africa being captured.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Intelligence[edit]\n\n\n### Axis[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Prelude | * Africa\n\t+ Second Italo-Ethiopian War\n* Asia\n\t+ Second Sino-Japanese War\n\t+ Battles of Khalkhin Gol\n* Europe\n\t+ Anschluss\n\t+ Munich Agreement\n\t+ Occupation of Czechoslovakia\n\t+ Operation Himmler\n\t+ Italian invasion of Albania\n |\n| 1939 | * Invasion of Poland\n* Battle of the Atlantic\n* Phoney War\n* First Battle of Changsha\n* Battle of South Guangxi\n* Winter War\n* 1939\u20131940 Winter Offensive\n |\n| 1940 | * Norwegian campaign\n* German invasion of Denmark\n* Battle of Zaoyang\u2013Yichang\n* German invasion of Luxembourg\n* German invasion of the Netherlands\n* German invasion of Belgium\n* Battle of France\n* Dunkirk evacuation\n* Battle of Britain\n* Battle of the Mediterranean\n* North Africa\n* West Africa\n* British Somaliland\n* Hundred Regiments Offensive\n* Baltic states\n* Eastern Romania\n* Japanese invasion of French Indochina\n* Italian invasion of Greece\n* *Compass*\n |\n| 1941 | * Battle of South Henan\n* Battle of Shanggao\n* Invasion of Yugoslavia\n* German invasion of Greece\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Of the estimated 70\u201385 million deaths attributed to World War II, around 30\u00a0million occurred on the Eastern Front, including 9 million children.[1][2] The Eastern Front was decisive in determining the outcome in the European theatre of operations in World War II, eventually serving as the main reason for the defeat of Nazi Germany and the Axis nations.[3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe battles on the Eastern Front of the Second World War constituted the largest military confrontation in history.[4] They were characterised by unprecedented ferocity and brutality, wholesale destruction, mass deportations, and immense loss of life due to combat, starvation, exposure, disease, and massacres. The two principal belligerent powers were Germany and the Soviet Union, along with their respective allies. Though never sending in ground troops to the Eastern Front, the United States and the United Kingdom both provided substantial material aid to the Soviet Union in the form of the Lend-Lease program along with naval and air support. The joint German\u2013Finnish operations across the northernmost Finnish\u2013Soviet border and in the Murmansk region are considered part of the Eastern Front. In addition, the Soviet\u2013Finnish Continuation War is generally also considered the northern flank of the Eastern Front.\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Anschluss, Munich Agreement, and Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Timeline of the Eastern Front of World War II\n* Historiography of World War II\n* Outline of World War II\n* *The Battle of Russia* \u2013 a film from the *Why We Fight* propaganda film series\n* Horses in World War II\n* Severity Order\n* Barbarossa decree\n* Commissar Order\n* Kantokuen - Japanese plan to invade the Soviet Far East in 1941\n\n### National and regional experiences[edit]\n\n\n* Bulgaria during World War II\n* Byelorussia in World War II\n* Carpathian Ruthenia during World War II\n* Estonia in World War II\n* Finland in World War II\n* German occupation of the Baltic states during World War II\n* Greece during World War II\n* Hungary in World War II\n* Italian participation on the Eastern Front\n* Romania in World War II\n* Soviet\u2013Japanese War\n* Soviet occupation of the Baltic states (1940)\n* Soviet occupation of the Baltic states (1944)\n* Soviet Union in World War II\n* Women in the Russian and Soviet military\n* Women in World War II\n* World War II in Yugoslavia\n\n### Lists[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This article **needs additional citations for verification**.

It is generally accepted as being the deadliest conflict in human history, with over 30\u00a0million killed as a result.[2] The German armed forces suffered 80% of its military deaths in the Eastern Front.[112] It involved more land combat than all other World War II theatres combined. The distinctly brutal nature of warfare on the Eastern Front was exemplified by an often wilful disregard for human life by both sides. It was also reflected in the ideological premise for the war, which also saw a momentous clash between two directly opposed ideologies.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Date | 22\u00a0June\u00a01941\u00a0(1941-06-22) \u2013 8\u00a0May\u00a01945\u00a0(1945-05-08)(3\u00a0years, 10\u00a0months, 2\u00a0weeks and 2\u00a0days) |\n| Location | Europe, east of Germany: Central and Eastern Europe, in later stages: Germany and Austria\n |\n| Result | Soviet victory[i]\n* Fall of Nazi Germany (concurrently with the Western Front)\n* Beginning of the Cold War and creation of the Eastern Bloc and the Iron Curtain\n* Beginning of anti-communist insurgencies\n |\n| Territorialchanges | Soviet occupation ofCentral and Eastern Europe\n\n* Allied occupation of Germany, Austria and Partition of Germany\n* Polish puppet state and change of borders\n* Soviet occupation of Romania\n* Soviet occupation of Hungary\n* Bulgarian communist coup and Soviet occupation\n* Soviet re-occupation of the Baltics\n* Czechoslovakia cedes Carpathian Ruthenia\n* East Prussia split between the Soviet Union (Kaliningrad Oblast) and Poland (Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship)\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n3. **^** Bellamy 2007, p.\u00a0xix: \"That conflict, which ended sixty years before this book's completion, was a decisive component \u2013 arguably the single most decisive component \u2013 of the Second World War.

After a 120-kilometre (75\u00a0mi) advance in January and February, the Leningrad Front had reached the borders of Estonia. To Stalin, the Baltic Sea seemed the quickest way to take the battles to the German territory in East Prussia and seize control of Finland.[87] The Leningrad Front's offensives towards Tallinn, a main Baltic port, were stopped in February 1944.

Combat in the Eastern Front began with the two powers remaining peaceful towards each other, with the annexation of countries such as Albania and portions of Poland by Germany and its allies, and the annexation of Finland and the rest of Poland by the Soviet Union. However, in 1941, Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union, putting an end to the peacetime. The majority of major battles in the Eastern Theatre from 1941 until the end of the war in 1945 were fought between the two powers.

          "content": "The Eastern Front of World War II was a major theater of conflict between the European Axis powers and the Soviet Union, along with their respective allies. It spanned from June 22, 1941, to May 9, 1945, and was characterized by some of the largest and deadliest battles in history. Here are key events and phases of the Eastern Front:\n\n1. **Operation Barbarossa (June 22, 1941)**: Nazi Germany launched a massive invasion of the Soviet Union, marking the beginning of the Eastern Front. The initial phase saw rapid German advances and significant Soviet losses.\n\n2. **Siege of Leningrad (September 8, 1941 \u2013 January 27, 1944)**: One of the longest and most destructive sieges in history, resulting in severe famine and casualties among the civilian population.\n\n3. **Battle of Moscow (October 2, 1941 \u2013 January 7, 1942)**: The German advance towards Moscow was halted by Soviet counteroffensives, marking the first major German defeat in the war.\n\n4. **Battle of Stalingrad (August 23, 1942 \u2013 February 2, 1943)**: One of the deadliest battles in history, resulting in a decisive Soviet victory and a turning point in the war. The German 6th Army was encircled and destroyed.\n\n5. **Battle of Kursk (July 5 \u2013 August 23, 1943)**: The largest tank battle in history, where Soviet forces successfully repelled the German offensive, further shifting the momentum in favor of the Allies.\n\n6. **Operation Bagration (June 22 \u2013 August 19, 1944)**: A massive Soviet offensive that destroyed the German Army Group Centre and liberated much of Eastern Europe.\n\n7. **Vistula-Oder Offensive (January 12 \u2013 February 2, 1945)**: Soviet forces advanced from Poland to the Oder River, bringing them close to Berlin.\n\n8. **Battle of Berlin (April 16 \u2013 May 2, 1945)**: The final major offensive of the European theater, resulting in the capture of Berlin by Soviet forces and the subsequent surrender of Nazi Germany.\n\nThe Eastern Front was marked by extreme brutality, immense loss of life, and significant destruction. It played a crucial role in the eventual defeat of Nazi Germany and had lasting impacts on the post-war geopolitical landscape, including the beginning of the Cold War and the creation of the Eastern Bloc.",

The Italian front is considered a separate but related theatre.[nb 12] The Western Front's 1944\u20131945 phase was officially deemed the European Theater by the United States, whereas Italy fell under the Mediterranean Theater along with North Africa. The Western Front was marked by two phases of large-scale combat operations. The first phase saw the capitulation of Luxembourg, Netherlands, Belgium, and France during May and June 1940 after their defeat in the Low Countries and the northern half of France, and continued into an air war between Germany and Britain that climaxed with the Battle of Britain. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n39. **^** \"12th Army Group Situation Map for 18 April 1945\".

In doing so, the Germans beat the Allies to the punch; the Allies had been planning an amphibious landing in which they could begin to surround Germany, cutting off her supply of raw materials from Sweden. However, when the Allies made a counter-landing in Norway following the German invasion, the Germans repulsed them and defeated the Norwegian armed forces, driving the latter into exile. The *Kriegsmarine*, nonetheless, suffered very heavy losses during the two months of fighting required to seize all of mainland Norway.\n\n\n\n### Battles for Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Belgium and France[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: German invasion of Luxembourg, Battle of the Netherlands, Battle of Belgium, and Battle of France\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nCampaigns of World\u00a0War\u00a0II\n |\n| --- |\n| **Europe**\n* Poland\n* Phoney War\n* Finland\n\t+ Winter War\n\t+ Karelia\n\t+ Lapland\n* Denmark and Norway\n* Western Front\n\t+ 1940\n\t+ 1944\u20131945\n* Britain\n* Balkans\n* Eastern Front\n* Italy\n\t+ Sicily\n\n\n**Asia-Pacific**\n\n* China\n* Pacific Ocean\n\t+ South West Pacific\n* Franco-Thai War\n* South-East Asia\n* Burma and India\n* Japan\n* Manchuria and Northern Korea\n\t+ pre-war border conflicts\n\n\n**Mediterranean and Middle East**\n\n* Africa\n\t+ North Africa\n\t+ East Africa\n* Mediterranean Sea\n* Adriatic\n* Malta\n* Middle East\n\t+ Iraq\n\t+ Syria\u2013Lebanon\n\t+ Iran\n* Dodecanese\n* Southern France\n\n\n**Other campaigns**\n\n* Americas\n* Atlantic\n* Arctic\n* Strategic bombing\n* French West Africa\n* Indian Ocean\n\t+ Madagascar\n\n\n**Coups**\n\n* Yugoslavia\n* Iraq\n* Italy\n* Romania\n* Bulgaria\n* Hungary\n* French Indochina\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nWestern Front ofWorld War II\n |\n| --- |\n| **Phoney War**\n* River Forth\n* Saar\n* The Heligoland Bight\n* *Wikinger*\n\n\n**Luxembourg**\n\n* Schuster Line\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Topics | * Air warfare of World War II\n\t+ In Europe\n* Blitzkrieg\n* Comparative military ranks\n* Cryptography\n* Declarations of war\n* Diplomacy\n* Governments in exile\n* Home front\n\t+ Australian\n\t+ United Kingdom\n\t+ United States\n* Lend-Lease\n* Manhattan Project\n\t+ British contribution\n* Military awards\n* Military equipment\n* Military production\n* Naval history\n* Nazi plunder\n* Opposition\n* Technology\n\t+ Allied cooperation\n\t+ Mulberry harbour\n* Total war\n* Strategic bombing\n* Puppet states\n* Women\n* Art and World War II\n* Music in World War II\n |\n| Theaters | * Asia and Pacific\n\t+ China\n\t+ South-East Asia\n\t+ Pacific\n\t+ North and Central Pacific\n\t+ South-West Pacific\n\t+ Indian Ocean\n* Europe\n\t+ Western Front\n\t+ Eastern Front\n* Mediterranean and Middle East\n\t+ North Africa\n\t+ East Africa\n\t+ Italy\n* West Africa\n* Atlantic\n\t+ timeline\n* Americas\n |\n| Aftermath | * Chinese Civil War\n* Cold War\n* Decolonization\n* Division of Korea\n* First Indochina War\n* Expulsion of Germans\n* Greek Civil War\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Date | * 3\u00a0September\u00a01939\u00a0\u2013 8\u00a0May\u00a01945\u00a0(1939-09-03\u00a0\u2013 1945-05-08)[nb 2]\n* (5\u00a0years, 8\u00a0months and 5\u00a0days)\n |\n| Location | Northern and Western Europe\n |\n| Result | **1939\u20131940**: Axis victory\n* Occupation of most of Western and Northern Europe by Axis troops\n* End of the French Third Republic and creation of the Vichy regime\n* Strategic stalemate following the Battle of Britain\n* Continuation with the Defense of the Reich and the Battle of the Atlantic\n* Beginning of the North Africa and East Africa campaigns\n\n**1944\u20131945**: Allied victory\n* Fall of Nazi Germany (concurrently with the Eastern Front)\n* Liberation of occupied countries in Western and Northern Europe\n* Beginning of the Iron Curtain and the Cold War\n |\n| Territorialchanges | Partition of Germany (1945) |\n\n |\n| Belligerents |\n| **Allies** ![](image)\u00a0United States![](image)\u00a0United Kingdom\n![](image)\u00a0France\n* ![](image)\u00a0Free France\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe second phase consisted of large-scale ground combat (supported by a massive strategic air war considered to be an additional front), which began in June 1944 with the Allied landings in Normandy and continued until the defeat of Germany in May 1945 with its invasion.\n\n\n\n\n## 1939\u20131940: Axis victories[edit]\n\n\nOn 1 September 1939, World War II began with the German invasion of Poland.
