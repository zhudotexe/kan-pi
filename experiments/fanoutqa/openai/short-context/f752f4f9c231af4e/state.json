For ozone (smog) pollution, Pittsburgh was ranked 24th among U.S. metro areas.[82][83] The area has improved its air quality with every annual survey. The ALA's rankings have been disputed by the Allegheny County Health Department (ACHD), since data from only the worst of the region's 20 air quality monitors is considered by the ALA, without any context or averaging.

The average high temperature peaks at 84\u00a0\u00b0F (29\u00a0\u00b0C), but highs can often surpass that, with the all-time record high standing at 105\u00a0\u00b0F (41\u00a0\u00b0C). Humidity is often around 80 percent, which is a drastic change for someone living in the Southwest United States. Rain is common, and is often accompanied by strong or severe thunderstorms. These will cause quite a large amount of rain, but they do not last long at all. Air conditioning is popular among most households in the summer months, because high temperatures and high humidity can make the air feel much warmer than the actual temperature.\n\n\n\n## Autumn[edit]\n\n\nAutumn is fairly mild, with daytime temperatures in the 70s and 60s. Autumn brings more wind, and sometimes heavier rainfall. Trees begin to lose their leaves before the cold winter season. Indian summer may occur.\n\n\n\n## Winter[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)A winter snow storm in Allentown in 2016\nAllentown began maintaining weather records in 1922. Records from 1922 to date include:[4]\n\n\n\n### Temperature[edit]\n\n\n* Highest recorded temperature: 105\u00a0\u00b0F (41\u00a0\u00b0C) on July 3, 1966\n* Lowest daily maximum temperature: 2\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221217\u00a0\u00b0C) on January 19, 1994\n* Highest daily minimum temperature: 79\u00a0\u00b0F (26\u00a0\u00b0C) on July 15, 1995\n* Lowest recorded temperature: \u221215\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221226\u00a0\u00b0C) on January 21, 1994\n* Highest daily average temperature: 91.0\u00a0\u00b0F (32.8\u00a0\u00b0C) on July 22, 2011\n* Lowest daily average temperature: \u22124.5\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221220.3\u00a0\u00b0C) on January 19, 1994\n\n\n### Precipitation and snow[edit]\n\n\n* Most precipitation in 24 hours: 8.71\u00a0in (221.2\u00a0mm) October 8, 2005\n* Heaviest 24-hour snowfall: 24.0\u00a0in (61.0\u00a0cm) on February 11, 1983\n* Greatest daily snow depth: 28\u00a0in (71\u00a0cm) on February 12, 1983\n\n\n## Summer[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAllentown occasionally has some severe weather, mostly thunderstorms and flooding. Winters can bring snow, with some years receiving very little of it while others seeing several major snowstorms, often Nor'easters. Winter also brings the more dangerous ice, sleet, and freezing rain, which has caused several traffic accidents over the years. Tropical storms and hurricanes occasionally survive up the coast of the Atlantic Ocean and cross into Pennsylvania. Storms such as Hurricane Ivan in 2004 and Hurricane Sandy in 2012 caused light to severe damage in Allentown and its surrounding suburbs.\n\n\n\n\n## Average temperatures[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Average extreme snow depth inches (cm)\n | 6.4(16)\n | 7.9(20)\n | 4.9(12)\n | 0.3(0.76)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.2(0.51)\n | 0.6(1.5)\n | 2.9(7.4)\n | 12.4(31)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (\u2265 0.01 in) | 11.4\n | 10.1\n | 10.9\n | 11.8\n | 12.4\n | 11.4\n | 11.0\n | 10.2\n | 9.6\n | 9.9\n | 8.9\n | 11.5\n | 129.1\n |\n| Average snowy days (\u2265 0.1 in) | 5.1\n | 4.3\n | 2.6\n | 0.3\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.5\n | 2.9\n | 15.7\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 70\n | 66\n | 62\n | 61\n | 66\n | 68\n | 70\n | 72\n | 74\n | 72\n | 70\n | 71\n | 69\n |\n| Percent possible sunshine | 43\n | 48\n | 53\n | 47\n | 54\n | 63\n | 57\n | 56\n | 54\n | 53\n | 45\n | 42\n | 51\n |\n| Source: NOAA (relative humidity 1981\u20132010)[1][2][3] |\n\n## Extremes[edit]\n\n\n![](image)An Allentown snow storm in 1918\n[[F\n\n![](image)Hamilton and Front Streets in Center City Allentown during the 1942 Allentown floodile:1933 - Phoenix Mills Flood.jpg|thumb|The Great Flood of Allentown in 1933]]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n## External links[edit]\n\n\n* Allentown at Weather.com\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nCity of Allentown\n |\n| --- |\n| * Architecture\n* Center City\n* Climate\n* County\n* Culture\n* Current mayor\n* Economy\n* Historical sites\n* History of baseball\n* In films\n* Mayors\n* Media\n* Neighborhoods\n* Notable people\n* Parking Authority\n* Parks and recreation\n* Region\n* School District\n* Sports\n |\n| ![](image) Category\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nLehigh Valley\n |\n| --- |\n| States | * Pennsylvania\n |\n| Counties | * Lehigh\n* Northampton\n |\n| Cities | * Allentown\n* Bethlehem\n* Easton\n |\n| Cities and towns100k-250k | * Allentown\n\t+ Center City Allentown\n |\n| Cities and towns50k-99k | * Bethlehem\n |\n| Cities and towns10-50k | * Bethlehem Township\n* Easton\n* Emmaus\n* Forks Township\n* Hanover Township\n* Lehigh Township\n* Lower Macungie Township\n* Lower Saucon Township\n* Northampton\n* North Whitehall Township\n* Palmer Township\n* Salisbury Township\n* South Whitehall Township\n* Upper Macungie Township\n* Upper Saucon Township\n* Whitehall Township\n |\n| Colleges and universities | * Baum School of Art\n* Cedar Crest College\n* DeSales University\n* Lafayette College\n* Lehigh Carbon Community College\n* Lehigh University\n* Moravian University\n* Muhlenberg College\n* Northampton Community College\n* Penn State Lehigh Valley\n |\n| Culture and history | * Allentown architecture\n* Allentown Art Museum\n* Allentown culture\n* Allentown historic places\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWinters are cool to cold, with January's high temperature at 35\u00a0\u00b0F (2\u00a0\u00b0C). The highest temperature recorded was 76\u00a0\u00b0F (24\u00a0\u00b0C) in February, 87\u00a0\u00b0F (31\u00a0\u00b0C) in March, and 72\u00a0\u00b0F (22\u00a0\u00b0C) in both December and January. Snowfall is common, with amounts varying greatly between seasons. Snow, ice, sleet, and freezing rain can cause road problems and school closures. In February 2007, Interstate Highway 78 was closed just west of the city. Drivers were stranded on the stretch of highway for as much as 24 hours, with overturned tractor trailers blocking the way. Winter sports are popular, such as snowboarding and skiing, and they can be enjoyed in the Pocono Mountains, just north of the Lehigh Valley.\n\n\n\n## Spring[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Allentown Symphony Orchestra\n* America on Wheels museum\n* Bach Choir of Bethlehem\n* Civic Theatre of Allentown\n* Coplay Cement Company Kilns\n* Da Vinci Science Center\n* In films\n* Lehigh County historic places\n* Lehigh County Historical Society\n* Miller Symphony Hall\n* National Museum of Industrial History\n* Northampton County historic places\n* Pennsylvania Shakespeare Festival\n* Shelter House\n* The 1803 House\n* Zoellner Arts Center\n |\n| Geography | * Blue Mountain\n* Chestnut Hill\n* Lehigh Valley AVA\n* Lehigh Gap\n* Lehigh River\n* South Mountain\n |\n| Hospitals and health networks | * Lehigh Valley Health Network\n* Lehigh Valley Hospital\u2013Cedar Crest\n* St. Luke's University Health Network\n |\n| Media | * Lehigh Valley media\n |\n| People | * Notable people\n |\n| Recreation and events | * Allentown Band\n* Bear Creek Mountain Resort\n* Blast Furnace Blues Festival\n* Bushkill Park\n* Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom\n* Great Allentown Fair\n* Lehigh Valley Zoo\n* Marine Band of Allentown\n* Mayfair Festival of the Arts\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Municipal Band of Allentown\n* Musikfest\n* Saucon Valley Country Club\n* SouthSide Film Festival\n* Trexler Nature Preserve\n* Wind Creek Bethlehem\n |\n| Shopping | * Lehigh Valley Mall\n* Outlets at Wind Creek\n* Palmer Park Mall\n* Promenade Saucon Valley\n* Shoppes at Trexler\n* South Mall\n* Westgate Mall\n* Whitehall Mall\n |\n| Sports | * Allentown baseball history\n* Allentown sports\n* Cycling\n* Gymnastics\n* High school sports\n* IronPigs AAA baseball\n* Lafayette Leopards\n* Lehigh Mountain Hawks\n* Lehigh Valley Roller Derby\n* Phantoms AHL ice hockey\n* Muhlenberg Mules\n* The Rivalry (Lafayette\u2013Lehigh)\n |\n| Transportation | * Allentown Queen City Municipal Airport\n* Braden Airpark\n* LANta\n* Lehigh Valley International Airport\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | 53.1(11.7)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n | 21.8(\u22125.7)\n | 23.2(\u22124.9)\n | 30.5(\u22120.8)\n | 40.3(4.6)\n | 50.6(10.3)\n | 59.9(15.5)\n | 64.7(18.2)\n | 62.8(17.1)\n | 55.2(12.9)\n | 43.8(6.6)\n | 34.1(1.2)\n | 26.8(\u22122.9)\n | 42.8(6.0)\n |\n| Mean minimum \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n | 4.2(\u221215.4)\n | 5.9(\u221214.5)\n | 14.1(\u22129.9)\n | 25.9(\u22123.4)\n | 35.3(1.8)\n | 46.5(8.1)\n | 53.7(12.1)\n | 51.1(10.6)\n | 39.9(4.4)\n | 28.7(\u22121.8)\n | 19.1(\u22127.2)\n | 11.7(\u221211.3)\n | 1.8(\u221216.8)\n |\n| Record low \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n | \u221215(\u221226)\n | \u221212(\u221224)\n | \u22125(\u221221)\n | 12(\u221211)\n | 28(\u22122)\n | 39(4)\n | 46(8)\n | 41(5)\n | 30(\u22121)\n | 21(\u22126)\n | 3(\u221216)\n | \u22128(\u221222)\n | \u221215(\u221226)\n |\n| Average precipitation inches (mm)\n | 3.30(84)\n | 2.77(70)\n | 3.63(92)\n | 3.67(93)\n | 3.65(93)\n | 4.40(112)\n | 5.30(135)\n | 4.56(116)\n | 4.84(123)\n | 4.14(105)\n | 3.24(82)\n | 3.86(98)\n | 47.36(1,203)\n |\n| Average snowfall inches (cm)\n | 9.8(25)\n | 10.8(27)\n | 6.3(16)\n | 0.5(1.3)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.2(0.51)\n | 0.9(2.3)\n | 4.6(12)\n | 33.1(84)\n |\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

The Reading area falls under the southern periphery of the hot-summer humid continental climate (*Dfa*), with areas just to the south designated as a humid subtropical climate zone (K\u00f6ppen *Cfa*). Summers are warm and humid with average July highs around 86.5\u00a0\u00b0F (30.3\u00a0\u00b0C). Extended periods of heat and high humidity occur. On average, there are 27 days per year where the temperature exceeds 90\u00a0\u00b0F (32\u00a0\u00b0C). Reading becomes milder in the autumn, as the heat and humidity of summer relent to lower humidity and temperatures.

It is located in the snow belt that stretches from Cleveland to Syracuse and Watertown; winters are moderately cold, with heavy lake-effect snow, but also with occasional stretches of mild weather that cause accumulated snow to melt. The city experiences a full range of weather events, including snow, ice, rain, thunderstorms, and fog. The city's lakeside location helps to temper summer heat, with an average of 4 days with highs at or above 90\u00a0\u00b0F (32\u00a0\u00b0C) annually, and the highest temperature ever recorded was 100\u00a0\u00b0F (38\u00a0\u00b0C) on June 25, 1988. An average of 3 days have lows of 0\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221218\u00a0\u00b0C) or colder annually, and the lowest temperature ever recorded was \u221218\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221228\u00a0\u00b0C) on January 19, 1994, and February 16, 2015.[27]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Climate data for Erie, Pennsylvania (Erie International Airport), 1991\u20132020 normals, extremes 1873\u2013present\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n | 73(23)\n | 77(25)\n | 82(28)\n | 89(32)\n | 91(33)\n | 100(38)\n | 99(37)\n | 96(36)\n | 99(37)\n | 89(32)\n | 82(28)\n | 75(24)\n | 100(38)\n |\n| Mean maximum \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n | 58.9(14.9)\n | 58.5(14.7)\n | 69.1(20.6)\n | 79.6(26.4)\n | 85.1(29.5)\n | 90.2(32.3)\n | 90.5(32.5)\n | 89.8(32.1)\n | 87.1(30.6)\n | 79.3(26.3)\n | 68.4(20.2)\n | 59.7(15.4)\n | 92.4(33.6)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n | 35.2(1.8)\n | 36.5(2.5)\n | 44.3(6.8)\n | 56.8(13.8)\n | 68.3(20.2)\n | 77.1(25.1)\n | 81.1(27.3)\n | 79.9(26.6)\n | 73.7(23.2)\n | 62.3(16.8)\n | 50.5(10.3)\n | 40.2(4.6)\n | 58.8(14.9)\n |\n| Daily mean \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n | 28.2(\u22122.1)\n | 28.9(\u22121.7)\n | 36.1(2.3)\n | 47.4(8.6)\n | 58.8(14.9)\n | 68.2(20.1)\n | 72.7(22.6)\n | 71.5(21.9)\n | 65.2(18.4)\n | 54.3(12.4)\n | 43.6(6.4)\n | 34.1(1.2)\n | 50.8(10.4)\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | 9.1(23)\n | 7.3(19)\n | 1.7(4.3)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 4.8(12)\n | 7.6(19)\n | 13.8(35)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (\u2265 0.01 in) | 19.7\n | 15.4\n | 14.3\n | 14.0\n | 13.5\n | 11.5\n | 10.5\n | 10.2\n | 10.1\n | 14.3\n | 14.9\n | 18.5\n | 166.9\n |\n| Average snowy days (\u2265 0.1 in) | 16.3\n | 12.3\n | 7.8\n | 2.3\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.2\n | 4.8\n | 11.5\n | 55.2\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 74.5\n | 75.4\n | 71.9\n | 67.9\n | 68.9\n | 71.3\n | 71.7\n | 74.0\n | 74.5\n | 71.1\n | 72.3\n | 75.0\n | 72.4\n |\n| Source: NOAA (relative humidity 1961\u20131990)[27][34][35] |\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of Erie, Pennsylvania\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Land | 19.13\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (49.55\u00a0km2) |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Water | 0.24\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (0.61\u00a0km2) \u00a0about 1.04% |\n| Elevation | 728\u00a0ft (222\u00a0m) |\n| Population(2020)[2]\n |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0City | 94,831 |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Density | 4,956.67/sq\u00a0mi (1,913.81/km2) |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Metro | 266,096 (Erie Metro) |\n| Demonym | Erieite(s) |\n| Time zone | UTC\u22125 (EST) |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Summer (DST) | UTC\u22124 (EDT) |\n| ZIP Codes | 16501\u221216512, 16514\u221216515, 16522, 16530\u221216534, 16538, 16541, 16544, 16546, 16550, 16553\u221216554, 16563, 16565\n |\n| Area codes | 814 and 582 |\n| FIPS code | 42-24000 |\n| Website | www.erie.pa.us |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\"Station: Erie INTL AP, PA\".

Average annual snowfall in the decade 2010-2019 was 100.7 inches (256\u00a0cm).[29] The adverse winter conditions caused USAir Flight 499 to overrun the runway at Erie International Airport on February 21, 1986, and caused whiteouts that were responsible for a 50-car pile-up on Interstate 90 on January 25, 2007.[30][31]\n\n\nThe coldest maximum temperature on record was \u22124\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221220\u00a0\u00b0C) in 1994 and the average coldest maximum between 1991 and 2020 was 13\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221211\u00a0\u00b0C).[27] The warmest overnight low on record was 82\u00a0\u00b0F (28\u00a0\u00b0C) once in 1918 and another time during the 1936 North American heat wave.[27] On average, the warmest low of the year is quite muggy 75\u00a0\u00b0F (24\u00a0\u00b0C).[27]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Erie** (/\u02c8\u026a\u0259ri/; *EER-ee*) is a city on the south shore of Lake Erie and the county seat of Erie County, Pennsylvania, United States. Erie is the fifth-largest city in Pennsylvania and the largest city in Northwestern Pennsylvania[3][4] with a population of 94,831 at the 2020 census.[3] The estimated population in 2023 had decreased to 92,732.[5] The Erie metropolitan area, equivalent to all of Erie County, consists of 266,096 residents.

It is 100 miles (160\u00a0km) northeast of Cleveland, Ohio, 90 miles (140\u00a0km) southwest of Buffalo, New York, and 128 miles (206\u00a0km) north of Pittsburgh. Erie's bedrock is Devonian shale and siltstone, overlain by glacial tills and stratified drift. Stream drainage in the city flows northward into Lake Erie, then through Lake Ontario into the St. Lawrence River, and out to the Atlantic Ocean. South of Erie is a drainage divide, beyond which most of the streams in western Pennsylvania flow south into the Allegheny or Ohio Rivers.[24] Lake Erie is about 571\u00a0ft (174\u00a0m) above sea level, while the city of Erie is about 728\u00a0ft (222\u00a0m) above sea level.\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
