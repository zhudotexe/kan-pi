It is the second vehicle marketed under the electric car-focused Ioniq sub-brand, and the fourth model developed on the Hyundai Electric Global Modular Platform (E-GMP).[4][5] The vehicle was first sold in South Korea in late 2022, with deliveries in the United States beginning in March 2023.\n\n\n\n\n## Overview[edit]\n\n\nThe Ioniq 6 was launched on 12 July 2022. It is produced at the Asan plant in South Korea, which also produces the Sonata and Grandeur,[6] starting in the third quarter of 2022.[7] Pre-orders started in July 2022.[8] Deliveries started in South Korea and selected European markets in late 2022. For the United States market, production started in January 2023, with sales beginning in March.[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 14 July 2022, the Ioniq 6 was unveiled at the 2022 Busan International Motor Show in South Korea.[9] EV performance tuning technology, electric vehicle virtual driving sound, and electric vehicle active sound design were applied. The vehicle's software can be improved with over-the-air updates, including the car's suspension, brakes, and airbags. In addition, driving assistance technologies such as navigation-based smart cruise control, highway driving assistance, and remote smart parking assistance are available.[8]\n\n\nIn November 2022, the Ioniq 6 achieved the highest overall rating in the Euro NCAP, including adult occupant protection, child occupant protection, pedestrian protection, and safety assistance systems.[10]\n\n\n\n* ![Rear view](image)\n\nRear view\n* ![](image)\n\nInterior\n\n\n### Design development[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hyundai Prophecy concept car\nThe Ioniq 6 was developed under the codename CE.[11] It was previewed by the Prophecy concept car which was showcased in March 2020.[12]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n21. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Golson, Daniel (14 July 2022). \"Awesome Hyundai RN22e Concept Previews Potential Ioniq 6 N EV\". *Road/Show*.

In addition, the Ioniq 6 is the first vehicle to use Hyundai's new stylized-H emblem, which was manufactured in the form of a thin plane made of aluminium. The side profile incorporates a streamlined window line, a built-in flush door handle, and optional side-mounted Digital Side Mirror (DSM) replacing conventional side mirrors. Attention to these and other aerodynamic details such as rear spoilers, external active air flaps, and wheel air curtains were credited for lowering the coefficient of drag to 0.21. The rear of the vehicle combines the rear spoiler with parametric pixel auxiliary braking light.[17]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nUsing an 800 V DC charger supplying 350 kW, the vehicle's battery can be charged from 10% to 80% in 18 minutes.[26] In the United States, new Ioniq 6 vehicles receive two years of unlimited 30-minute free charging sessions at DC fast chargers owned by Electrify America.[28]\n\n\n\n## Awards[edit]\n\n\n* World Car of The Year 2023[29][30]\n* World Car Design of The Year 2023[31][30]\n* World Electric Vehicle of The Year 2023[32][30]\n\n\n## Sales[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | South Korea[33] | United States\n | Europe\n | Global sales\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2022\n | 11,289\n | 0\n | 6\n | 14,821\n |\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA design sketch was released first as a teaser image on 21 June 2022.[13] The concept sketch of the car represented the \"Electrified Streamliner\" design approach, built on Hyundai's new E-GMP platform; the sketch showed a soft streamlined design that minimizes wind resistance. A long wheelbase was applied compared to the overall height.[14]\n\n\nA series of photos showing details were released in the days leading up to 29 June 2022, when an overall photograph of the Ioniq 6 was unveiled.[15][16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n15. **^** Mihalascu, Dan (28 June 2022). \"2024 Hyundai Ioniq 6 Unveiled As Striking Electric Streamliner\". *INSIDE EVs*.

The forthcoming Ioniq 6-based racing car will replace the Veloster N ETCR that was raced in 2021 and 2022.[22] During a hands-on session at the Bilster Berg track, *Motor Trend* writer Angus MacKenzie noted \"the RN22e was setup deliberately to be something of a show-off drift king, to prove an EV can make you smile behind the wheel\".[22]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nEstimated range is 610 km (380 mi) for the RWD version with the larger (Long Range, 77.4 kWh) battery, using the WLTP cycle.[9] Under Korean test standards, the long-range RWD version with 18-inch wheels was expected to have a range of 524 km (326 mi).[8] For models sold in the United States, the EPA ratings are 361 mi (581 km) for the Long Range RWD and 316 mi (509 km) for the Long Range AWD models with 18-inch wheels; with the larger 20-inch wheels, range drops to 305 and 270 mi (491 and 435 km) for the RWD and AWD versions, respectively.[25]\n\n\nThe standard range version with the smaller 53 kWh battery and 18-inch wheels is expected to have a consumption of less than 14 kWh/100 km (150 mpg‑e),[26] about equal to the shorter range Hyundai Ioniq Electric. The Standard Model was originally not planned to be marketed in the United States [26] but ended up being marketed.[27]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBattery electric mid-size sedan\n\nNot to be confused with Hyundai Ioniq or  Maxus Euniq 6.\n\n\n\n\n\nMotor vehicle\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe *RN22e* concept is derived from the Ioniq 6 and carries the Hyundai N motorsport sub-brand; it also was revealed in July 2022. The RN22e previews an Ioniq 6 N high-performance variant for regular production;[18] it is equipped with an all-wheel drive powertrain featuring upgraded traction motors that have outputs of 160 and 270 kW (218 and 367 PS; 215 and 362 hp) front and rear, respectively, and electronic torque vectoring on the rear differential using a twin-clutch system, branded e-TVTC.[19][20] Combined output is 430 kW (585 PS; 577 hp) and 740 N⋅m (546 lbf⋅ft), identical to the drivetrain of the Kia EV6 GT.[21] The motors now rotate at up to 20,000 RPM, compared to 15,000 RPM in the regular Ioniq 6, increasing top speed. Power is supplied by a 77.4 kW-hr battery.[22]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHyundai Executive Vice President SangYup Lee, who leads the Hyundai Design Centre, described the interior as \"a mindful cocoon that offers personalized place for all\".[16] The extended interior space is created by the vehicle's long wheelbase. The vehicle function operation unit was designed to be centralized and the storage space was expanded by applying a bridge-type centre console. In addition, eco-friendly materials were applied to interior and exterior painting, sheets, dashboards, and headliners.[17]\n\n\n\n### RN22e[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_5Qyia62CtG4Ue1LjvKCg7dGg","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

The I-Pace was announced in March 2018, European deliveries began in June 2018 and North American deliveries started in October 2018.\n\n\n\n\n## Development[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The production car is 12 mm narrower and 12 mm lower than the concept (pictured).\nThe Jaguar I-Pace was designed by Ian Callum.[1] The concept version of the car, described as a five-seater sports car, was unveiled by JLR at the 2016 Los Angeles Motor Show and shown on-road in London in March 2017.[2][3]\n\n\nThe I-Pace is built by contract manufacturer Magna Steyr in Graz, Austria,[4][5] and the production version of the I-Pace was revealed in Graz on 1 March 2018.[6]\n\n\nSome of the electric drive technology[*which?*] has come out of the Jaguar I-Type electric Formula E racing car programme,[7] and the concentric motors were developed by JLR engineer Dr. Alex Michaelides.[8]\n\n\n\n\n## Specifications[edit]\n\n\n* ![Side](image)\n\nSide\n* ![Rear](image)\n\nRear\n* ![Interior](image)\n\nInterior\n\n\nThe Jaguar I-Pace launched with a WLTP-rated range of 292 miles (470 km)[9] and an EPA-rated range of 234 miles (377 km). In December 2019, software enhancements were released to increase range to an EPA-rated range of 246 miles (396 km).[10][11] The car has a wade depth[*clarification needed*] of 500 mm (20 in).[12] The rear boot holds 656 litres (23 cu ft),[13] along with 28 litres (1 cu ft) of front boot space. The drag coefficient is 0.29.[1]\n\n\nThe car has all-wheel drive via two motors powered by a 90 kWh LG Chem[1] lithium-ion battery with a battery management system developed by JLR.[8] Each motor delivers 197 hp (147 kW) and 258 lb⋅ft (350 N⋅m) of torque, for a total power of 395 hp (295 kW) and total torque of 516 lb⋅ft (700 N⋅m).[1] The 0–62 mph (0–100 km/h) time is 4.8 seconds,[9] and the top speed is electronically limited to 124 mph (200 km/h).[14]\n\n\nThe battery contains 432 pouch cells.[15] It can charge from 0 to 80 per cent in 85 minutes using 50 kW DC charging, or 45 minutes using a 100 kW charger. Home charging with an AC wall box (7 kW) achieves the same state of charge in 10 hours.[14] As the I-Pace was initially released with a single-phase 7 kW AC charger, a one-hour charge, would add around 30 km (19 miles) of range.[16] Later 2021 models had 11 kW AC charging, at single-phase or three-phase, depending on market.\n\n\nThe car comes with a smartphone app which can locate the car, report on its locking, alarming, and charging status, and start its battery preconditioning and/or cabin heating/cooling.[17]\n\n\n\n## Awards[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jaguar Chief of Design Ian Callum holds 2019 European Car of the Year trophy for the Jaguar I-Pace\nThe I-Pace has won 62[18] international awards. In March 2019, it won the European Car of the Year award, the first Jaguar to win the award.[19] In April 2019, it became the 2019 World Car of the Year, and won Best Design and Best Green Car awards.[20]\n\n\n\n## Safety[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2018,[21] the European New Car Assessment Programme (NCAP) awarded the Jaguar I-Pace a 5-star safety rating.\n\n\n\nEuro NCAP test results  \n\nJaguar I-Pace (2018)[22] \n| Test\n | Points\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Overall:\n | ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image) |\n| Adult occupant:\n | 34.8\n | 91%\n |\n| Child occupant:\n | 40.0\n | 81%\n |\n| Pedestrian:\n | 35.3\n | 73%\n |\n| Safety assist:\n | 10.6\n | 81%\n |\n\n## Racing[edit]\n\n\n### Jaguar I-Pace eTrophy (Racecar)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Jaguar I-Pace eTrophy (racecar)\n\nThe Jaguar I-Pace has a race-prepped version called the I-Pace eTrophy, a development of the I-Pace by Jaguar Special Vehicle Operations.\n\n\n\n### Series[edit]\n\n\nIn September 2017,[23] Jaguar announced their single-make racing series for the I-Pace, called eTrophy, after the racecar of the same name.\n\n\nOn 24 August 2018,[24] the Jaguar I-Pace set a new EV lap record at Laguna Seca Racetrack in California.\n\n\n\n## Sales[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year | Europe[25] | United States[26] |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 2018 | 6,490 | 393\n |\n| 2019 | 12,232 | 2,594\n |\n| 2020 | 13,444 | 1,546\n |\n| 2021 | 8,079 | 1,409\n |\n| **Total** | **40,245** | **5,942** |\n\n\n## Partnership for autonomous ride service[edit]\n\n\nIn 2018, Waymo selected the Jaguar I-Pace for use in its autonomous ride-hailing service, placing an order for 20,000 vehicles.[27]\n\n\n\n## Wireless charging project[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2020, Jaguar announced its support for a wirelessly-charged taxi project in Oslo, Norway. Jaguar will give 25 I-Pace vehicles to taxi company Cabonline, which will use the vehicles to test the charging infrastructure on taxis in the Norwegian capital. Ralf Speth, Jaguar Land Rover's chief executive said \"The taxi industry is the ideal test bed for wireless charging, and indeed for high-mileage electric mobility across the board\"[*dubious – discuss*].[28]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** Davies, Chris (14 November 2016). \"Jaguar I-Pace Concept previews Model X rivaling EV for 2018\". *slashgear.com*.

Crozz and I.D. Crozz II concept cars, which debuted in 2017 at the Shanghai and Frankfurt Auto Show, respectively.[14] A prototype version of the ID.4 appeared in camouflage at the 2019 Frankfurt Motor Show discreetly so as not to steal the show from the first electric mass-market vehicle of the German brand, the ID.3.[15]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHeadlights and taillights are mostly LED lamps on the ID.4, with Matrix LED lights being an optional feature in some regions. The front features a low-positioned air inlet behind which the radiator and parts of the air conditioning system are located. Short overhangs and a wheelbase of 2,766 mm (108.9 in) add up to a length of 4,584 mm (180.5 in). Wheels are offered in 18–21 inch sizes. RWD models can tow a maximum of 1,000 kg (2,200 lb) braked with an optional tow bar and fits roof rails as standard.[18]\n\n\nApple Carplay and Android Auto are offered as standard, in addition to an optional augmented reality head-up display (HUD). In addition to the 5.3 inch driver display, the ID.4 features a 10-inch infotainment screen, though an optional 12 inch screen is available. By default, the vehicle includes a light strip below the windscreen providing visual cues related to certain functions such as the state of charge (SOC) when charging or brake alerts, which VW calls \"ID. Light\".\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n46. **^** \"Volkswagen of America reports Q4 and 2021 year-end sales results\". *Volkswagen US Media Site*. 2022-01-07.

A mid-size, three-row, seven-passenger SUV, the Telluride concept is based on a modified Sorento chassis, and powered by a transversely-mounted 3.5-liter gasoline direct injected V6 producing 270 hp (201 kW) combined with an electric motor producing 130 hp (97 kW), for an overall output of 400 hp (298 kW). Fuel consumption is claimed to be 30 miles per US gallon (7.8 L/100 km).[18]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Rear view\nThe production version of the Telluride was launched at the 2019 North American International Auto Show in January. Previously, the Telluride was displayed as a customized version inspired by fashion designer Brandon Maxwell's Texas-inspired collection, at New York Fashion Week in September 2018.[8] The overall design is similar to the 2016 concept except for the front end which was completely redesigned.\n\n\nThe Telluride is the first Kia designed specifically for the US market, with the design work handled at the Kia Design Center in Irvine, California.[9] The production version Telluride is powered by a 3.8-liter *Lambda II* V6 Atkinson cycle gasoline engine rated at 291 hp (295 PS; 217 kW) and 355 N⋅m (36.2 kg⋅m; 262 lb⋅ft), paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission and either front-wheel drive or all-wheel-drive.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Telluride features four drive modes – Smart, Eco, Sport and Comfort. Snow and AWD Lock modes are also available for specific driving conditions, and the on-demand electro-hydraulic AWD system with multi-plate clutch plate constantly redistributes power to both axles. In Eco and Smart modes, power is completely routed to the front wheels, whereas Sport mode splits the power down to 65 percent front, 35 percent rear.[10]\n\n\nThe standard towing rate for this SUV is rated at 5,000 pounds (2,300 kg), and it also features the optional self-levelling rear suspension where the ride height is automatically calibrated depending on vehicle load to optimise control and stability.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n« previous — Kia automobile timeline, 2000–present\n |\n| --- |\n| |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Type** | 2000s\n | 2010s\n | 2020s\n |\n| 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9\n | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9\n | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4\n |\n| City car | Visto (MXL) | Picanto (SA) | Picanto (TA) | Picanto (JA) |\n|  |  | Ray (TAM) |\n| Subcompact | Pride (Y) |  | Qianlima (X3) |  |  |  |\n|  |  | Pegas (AB) |\n| Rio (DC) | Rio (JB) | Rio (UB) | Rio (YB) | K3 (BL7) |\n| Compact |  | cee'd (ED) | cee'd (JD) | Ceed (CD) |\n| Sephia II (S-II) | Cerato (LD) | Forte (TD) | Forte (YD) | Forte (BD) | K4 (CL4) |\n|  |  | K4 (China) (PF) |  |\n| Mid-size | Optima (MS) | Optima (MG) | Optima (TF) | Optima (JF) | K5 (DL3) |\n|  |  | Stinger (CK) |  |\n| Full-size/Executive | Enterprise (T3) | Opirus (GH) | K7/Cadenza (VG) | K7/Cadenza (YG) | K8 (GL3) |\n| Potentia |  |  | K9 (KH) | K9 (RJ) |\n| Subcompact SUV | Retona (AM) |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  | Clavis |\n|  |  | Sonet (QY) |\n|  |  | KX Cross (UC) |  |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nKia North American road car timeline, 1994–present\n |\n| --- |\n| |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Type** | 1990s\n | 2000s\n | 2010s\n | 2020s\n |\n| 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9\n | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9\n | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9\n | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4\n |\n| Subcompact |  |  | Rio | Rio | Rio | Rio |  |\n| Compact car | Sephia | Sephia |  |  |  |\n|  | Spectra | Spectra | Forte | Forte | Forte |\n| Mid-size car |  |  | Optima/Magentis | Optima/Magentis | Optima | Optima | K5 |\n|  |  |  | Stinger |  |\n| Full-size car |  |  | Amanti |  | Cadenza | Cadenza |  |\n|  |  |  | K900 |  | K900 |  |\n| Subcompact CUV |  |  |  | Niro | Niro |\n|  |  | Soul | Soul | Soul |\n|  |  |  |  | Seltos |\n| Compact CUV |  |  | Sportage | Sportage | Sportage | Sportage |\n|  |  |  |  | EV6 |\n| Mid-size CUV |  |  |  | Sorento | Sorento | Sorento |\n|  |  |  | Telluride |\n|  |  |  |  | EV9 |\n| Compact SUV |  | Sportage | Sorento |  |  |\n| Mid-size SUV |  |  | Borrego | Borrego |  |  |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Kia Telluride.\n\n* Official website\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nKia Corporation\n |\n| --- |\n| An affiliate of Hyundai Motor Company\n |\n| Parent | * Hyundai Motor Company\n |\n| Subsidiaries and divisions | * Kia Lucky Motors\n* Kia India\n* Kia Motors Manufacturing Georgia\n* Kia Motors Mexico\n* Kia Motors Slovakia\n* Yueda Kia (50%)\n |\n| Current models | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Cars | * Ceed\n* EV6\n* Forte/K3/Cerato\n* K3 (2024)\n* K4 (2025)\n* K5\n* K8\n* K9\n* Pegas/Soluto\n* Picanto/Morning\n* Ray\n |\n| Crossovers/SUVs | * EV3\n* EV5\n* EV9\n* Mohave\n* Niro\n\t+ Niro Plus\n* Seltos\n* Sonet\n* Sorento\n* Soul\n* Sportage\n* Sportage Ace\n* Stonic\n* Telluride\n* XCeed\n |\n| Minivans | * Carens\n* Carnival\n |\n| Pickup trucks | * Bongo/K-Series\n |\n| Buses | * Granbird\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAll Tellurides are equipped with various features that are otherwise optional in some of its competitors, such as \"Sofino\" (leatherette)-trimmed or leather-trimmed seating surfaces. Available equipment includes a 10.25-inch touchscreen infotainment system, rear view monitor, 630-watt 10-speaker Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone charging tray, and head-up display with turn-by-turn navigation, along with heated and ventilated first and second row bucket seats. The Telluride is also equipped with Driver Talk for some trim levels, an in-car intercom system that allows the driver to communicate separately with passengers in the second or third row.[10]\n\n\n\n\n## 2023 refresh[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Telluride is not marketed in South Korea as it is only produced in the United States, whereas its Hyundai counterpart, the Korean-built Palisade is marketed there instead.[11] Exports from the West Point, Georgia plant to the Middle East started in February 2019.[12] Kia limited exports of the Telluride to around 3,000 units annually.[13] This is mainly due to the fact that non-Korean made vehicles are subjected to high tariffs, and is also not marketed in Australia due to the law stating that only RHD vehicles can be driven on public roads.\n\n\n\n## Trim levels[edit]\n\n\nIn U.S. and Canada, the Telluride is offered in four trim levels: LX, S, EX, and SX.[14] The latter is offered with an optional \"SX Prestige Package,\" which include several premium features.[15] Since 2021, Kia has offered a \"Premium Package\" on the EX trim. A 3-seat bench is standard for the second row while captain's chairs can be added, dropping the seating capacity from eight to seven.[9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_pdINY1vBrJTrU35hi5DclVnH","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
