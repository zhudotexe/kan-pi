Lying on the northwest coast of Java, the world's most populous island, Jakarta is the largest metropole in Southeast Asia, and serves as the diplomatic capital of ASEAN. Jakarta is bordered by two Sundanese provinces: West Java to the south and east; and, since 2000, Banten to the west.

It is strategically located near the Sunda Strait. The northern part of Jakarta is plain land, some areas of which are below sea level,[47] and subject to frequent flooding. The southern parts of the city are hilly. It is one of only two Asian capital cities located in the southern hemisphere (along with East Timor's Dili). Officially, the area of the Jakarta Special District is 661.23 km2 (255 sq mi) of land area and 6,977 km2 (2,694 sq mi) of sea area.[48] The Thousand Islands, which are administratively a part of Jakarta, are located in Jakarta Bay, north of the city.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Central Jakarta\n* North Jakarta\n* South Jakarta\n* West Jakarta\n* East Jakarta\n* Thousand Islands\n |\n| Originated | 397 CE as Sunda Kelapa |\n| Founded | 22 June 1527; 496 years ago (1527-06-22)[2] |\n| Established as Batavia | 30 May 1619; 405 years ago (1619-05-30) |\n| City status | 4 March 1621; 403 years ago (1621-03-04)[2] |\n| Province status | 28 August 1961; 62 years ago (1961-08-28)[2] |\n| Capital | None[b] |\n| Government |\n|  • Type | Special administrative area |\n|  • Body | Special Capital Region of Jakarta Provincial Government |\n|  • Acting Governor | Heru Budi Hartono |\n|  • Vice Governor | *Vacant* |\n|  • Legislative | Jakarta Regional People's Representative Council |\n| Area |\n|  • Special Capital Region | 661.23 km2 (255.30 sq mi) |\n|  • Urban | 3,540 km2 (1,367 sq mi) |\n|  • Metro | 7,062.5 km2 (2,726.8 sq mi) |\n|  • Rank | 38th in Indonesia |\n| Elevation | 8 m (26 ft) |\n| Population(mid-2022 estimate)[3]\n |\n|  • Special Capital Region | 10,679,951 |\n|  • Rank | 6th in Indonesia |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nJakarta is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in Southeast Asia. Established in the fourth century as Sunda Kelapa, the city became an important trading port for the Sunda Kingdom. At one time, it was the *de facto* capital of the Dutch East Indies, when it was known as Batavia. Jakarta was officially a city within West Java until 1960 when its official status was changed to a province with special capital region distinction. As a province, its government consists of five administrative cities and one administrative regency. Jakarta is an alpha world city and is the seat of the ASEAN secretariat. Financial institutions such as the Bank of Indonesia, Indonesia Stock Exchange, and corporate headquarters of numerous Indonesian companies and multinational corporations are located in the city. In 2021, the city's GRP PPP was estimated at US$602.946 billion.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nJakarta's main challenges include rapid urban growth, ecological breakdown, gridlocked traffic, congestion, and flooding. Jakarta is sinking up to 17 cm (6.7 inches) annually, which has made the city more prone to flooding and one of the fastest-sinking capitals in the world. In response to these challenges, in August 2019, President Joko Widodo announced his agreement with an official study that the capital of Indonesia would be moved from Jakarta to the planned city of Nusantara, in the province of East Kalimantan on the island of Borneo. The Parliament approved the move on 18 January 2022.\n\n\n\n\n## Name[edit]\n\n\nJakarta has been home to multiple settlements. Below is the list of names used during its existence:\n\n\n\n> \n> Sunda Kelapa (397–1527)  \n> \n> Jayakarta (1527–1619)  \n> \n> ![Dutch East Indies](image) Batavia (1619–1942)  \n> \n> ![Indonesia](image) Djakarta (1942–1972)  \n> \n> ![Indonesia](image) Jakarta (1972–present)  \n> \n> \n> \n> \n>\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMoreover, Jakarta is sinking about 5 to 10 cm (2.0 to 3.9 in) each year, and up to 20 cm (7.9 in) in the northern coastal areas. After a feasibility study, a ring dyke known as Giant Sea Wall Jakarta is under construction around Jakarta Bay to help cope with the threat from the sea. The dyke will be equipped with a pumping system and retention areas to defend against seawater and function as a toll road. The project is expected to be completed by 2025.[52] In January 2014, the central government agreed to build two dams in Ciawi, Bogor and a 1.2 km (0.75 mi) tunnel from Ciliwung River to Cisadane River to ease flooding in the city.[53] Nowadays, a 1.2 km (0.75 mi), with capacity 60 m3 (2,100 cu ft) per second, underground water tunnel between Ciliwung River and the East Flood Canal is being worked on to ease the Ciliwung River overflows.[54] In 2023, the New York Times reported that in some places Jakarta is sinking up to 12 inches (30 cm) annually.[55]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Jakarta\n |\n| --- |\n| Special Capital Region\n |\n| Special Capital Region of Jakarta*Daerah Khusus Ibukota Jakarta* |\n| ![](image)\nJakarta CBD skyline\n![](image)\nCar free day in Bundaran HI\n![](image)\nMerdeka Palace\n![](image)\nNational Museum of Indonesia\n![](image)\nGelora Bung Karno Stadium\n![](image)\nJakarta History Museum in Jakarta Old Town\n![](image)\nMonas\n |\n| \n![Coat of arms of Jakarta](image)Coat of arms\n![Official logo of Jakarta](image)Wordmark\n |\n| Nicknames: * *The Big Durian*\n* *New York Van Java*\n* *J-Town*[1]\n |\n| Motto(s): *Jaya Raya* (Sanskrit)\"Victorious and Great\"Slogan: *Jakarta Kota Kolaborasi*[a]\"Jakarta a City of Collaboration\"\n |\n| ![Map](image)Interactive map outlining Jakarta  (parts of Thousand Islands not visible)\n |\n| ![Jakarta is located in Java](image)![Jakarta](image)\nJakarta\nLocation in Java\nShow map of Java\n![Jakarta is located in Indonesia](image)![Jakarta](image)\nJakarta\nLocation in Indonesia\nShow map of Indonesia\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nJakarta's cities/municipalities (*Kota Administratif*)\n| KodeWilayah\n | Name of City orRegency\n | Area inkm2 | Pop'n 2010 census[208] | Pop'n 2020 census[209] | Pop'n mid 2022estimate[11] | Pop'n density(per km2)in mid 2021\n | HDI[210] 2021 estimates\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 31.74\n | South Jakarta | 144.94 | 2,062,232 | 2,226,812 | 2,244,623 | 15,487\n | 0.849 (Very High)\n |\n| 31.75\n | East Jakarta | 185.54 | 2,693,896 | 3,037,139 | 3,083,883 | 16,621\n | 0.829 (Very High)\n |\n| 31.71\n | Central Jakarta | 47.56 | 902,973 | 1,056,896 | 1,079,995 | 22,708\n | 0.815 (Very High)\n |\n| 31.73\n | West Jakarta | 124.97 | 2,281,945 | 2,434,511 | 2,448,975 | 19,597\n | 0.817 (Very High)\n |\n| 31.72\n | North Jakarta | 147.46 | 1,645,659 | 1,778,981 | 1,793,550 | 12,162\n | 0.805 (Very High)\n |\n| 31.01\n | Thousand Islands | 10.73 | 21,082 | 27,749 | 28,925 | 2,696\n | 0.721 (High)\n |\n\n\n## Transportation[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Category:Roads of Jakarta\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nJakarta has established a partnership with Rotterdam, especially on integrated urban water management, including capacity-building and knowledge exchange.[240] This cooperation is mainly because both cities are dealing with similar problems; they lie in low-lying flat plains and are prone to flooding.

The Yamuna is considered a river of heaven. The Rig Veda includes the Yamuna River as one of the seven sacred rivers, along with the Ganges.[46] According to Hindu mythology, the River was brought to Earth by the ascetic practice of the Seven Sages where she first descended on Mount Kalinda.

A 2016 study shows that there is 100% urban metabolism of River Yamuna as it passes through the National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi.[62] The most pollution comes from Wazirabad, from where Yamuna enters Delhi.[63]\n\n\n\n### Causes[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nRivers of India\n |\n| --- |\n| **Great Rivers of India**  Indus · Ganges · Yamuna · Brahmaputra · Narmada · Godavari · Krishna · Kaveri\n |\n| Indus Basin | * Indus\n\t+ Panjnad, Pakistan\n\t\t- Sutlej\n\t\t\t* Beas\n\t\t\t\t+ Parvati\n\t\t\t* Baspa\n\t\t\t* Spiti\n\t\t- Chenab\n\t\t\t* Ravi\n\t\t\t* Jhelum\n\t\t\t\t+ Neelum/Kishanganga\n\t\t\t\t+ Sind\n\t\t\t\t+ Lidder\n\t\t\t* Tawi\n\t\t\t* Marusudar\n\t+ Shyok\n\t\t- Nubra\n\t+ Suru\n\t\t- Dras\n\t\t- Shingo\n\t+ Yapola\n\t+ Zanskar\n\t\t- Markha\n\t\t- Khurna\n\t\t- Tsarap\n\t\t- Doda\n\t+ Hanle\n |\n| Ganges Basin | * Ganga\n\t+ Hooghly\n\t\t- Damodar\n\t\t\t* Barakar\n\t\t- Jadh Ganga/Jahanavi\n\t\t- Jalangi\n\t\t- Churni\n\t\t- Ichamati\n\t\t- Rupnarayan\n\t\t- Ajay\n\t\t- Mayurakshi\n\t\t- Dwarakeswar\n\t\t- Mundeswari\n\t+ Meghna\n\t+ Padma\n\t+ Punarbhaba\n\t+ Atrai\n\t+ Mahananda\n\t+ Kosi\n\t+ Bagmati\n\t+ Burhi Gandak\n\t\t- Phalgu\n\t+ Gandaki\n\t+ Son\n\t\t- North Koel\n\t\t\t* Amanat\n\t\t- Rihand\n\t\t- Gopad\n\t\t\t* Goini\n\t\t\t* Neur\n\t\t- Banas\n\t\t- Johilla\n\t+ Ghaghara\n\t\t- West Rapti\n\t\t\t* Rohni\n\t\t- Sharda\n\t\t\t* Ladhiya\n\t\t\t* Sarju\n\t\t\t* Gori Ganga\n\t\t\t* Darma\n\t+ Gomti/Gomati\n\t\t- Sarayan\n\t\t- Kathana\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Agra Canal headworks at Okhla barrage, Delhi, 1871\nUse of the Yamuna's waters for irrigation in the Indo-Gangetic Plains is enhanced by its many canals, some dating to the 14th century Tughlaq dynasty, which built the *Nahr-i-Bahisht* (Paradise) parallel to the river.

When completed, the SYL will allow shipping from India's east coast to the west coast and the Arabian sea, shortening important commercial links for north-central India's large population. The canal starts near Delhi, and is designed to transfer Haryana's share of 4.3 km3 (3,500,000 acre⋅ft) from the Indus Basin.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### National Waterway[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\nYamuna is one of the National Waterways of India, designated as NW110 in Haryana, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh. Some of its sections are being developed for navigation:[44][45]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWazirabad barrage to New Okhla Barrage, \"22 km stretch of Yamuna in Delhi, is less than 2% of Yamuna's total length but accounts for nearly 80% of the total pollution in the river\",[7] 22 out of 35 sewage treatment plants in Delhi do not meet the wastewater standards prescribed by the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC), thus untreated wastewater and poor quality of water discharged from the wastewater treatment plants are the major reasons.[7] As of 2019, the river receives 800 million litres of largely untreated sewage and additional 44 million litres of industrial effluents each day, of which only 35 percent of the sewage released into the river are believed to be treated.[64] In 1994, the states of Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Rajasthan and Delhi made a water sharing agreement that is due for revision in 2025. To achieve a water quality suitable for bathing (BOD<3 mg/L and DO>5 mg/L) would require a greater rate of water flow in the river. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe stretch of the river from its origin at Yamunotri to Okhla barrage in Delhi is called \"Upper Yamuna\". A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed amongst the five basin states (Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Haryana, Rajasthan, and Delhi) on 12 May 1994 for sharing of its waters. This led to the formation of the Upper Yamuna River Board under India's Ministry of Water Resources, whose primary functions are: regulation of the available flows amongst the beneficiary states and monitoring the return flows; monitoring conservation and upgrading the quality of surface and groundwater; maintaining hydro-meteorological data for the basin; overviewing plans for watershed management; and monitoring and reviewing the progress of all projects up to and including Okhla barrage.[26]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe river crosses several states such as Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Delhi. It also meets several tributaries along the way, including Tons, Chambal, its longest tributary which has its own large basin, followed by Sindh, the Betwa, and Ken. From Uttarakhand, the river flows into the state of Himachal Pradesh. After passing Paonta Sahib, Yamuna flows along the boundary of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh and after exiting Haryana it continues to flow till it merges with the river Ganges at Sangam or Prayag in Prayagraj (Uttar Pradesh). It helps create the highly fertile alluvial Ganges-Yamuna Doab region between itself and the Ganges in the Indo-Gangetic plain.[3][4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n29. **^** Flood Forecasting Network in India Ministry of Water Resources website.\n30. **^** Bharati Chaturvedi, 2010, Finding Delhi: Loss and Renewal in the Megacity\n31. **^** Regional plan\n32. **^** Bharati Chaturvedi, 2010, Finding Delhi: Loss and Renewal in the Megacity, Page 78.\n33. **^** ML Ahmed, Analysis of Discharge and Gauge-Level Data at Old Railway Bridge, Int'l Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Energy and Manufacturing Engineering (ICAEME’2014), 9–10 June 2014, Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia).\n34. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Tak, Prakash C.; Sati, Jagdish P.; Rizvi, Anjum N.

The Miyun Reservoir, the largest in the municipality, is created at the confluence of the Chao and Bai Rivers, which forms the Chaobai. The Yongding, before entering the municipality in Mentougou District, is dammed to create the vast Guanting Reservoir of Hebei Province. Despite these reservoirs, the city of Beijing faces chronic water shortages due to water-intensive agriculture, industry, and population growth. Under the South-North Water Transfer Project, the city plans to draw water from the Yangtze River through the Grand Canal, which was built 800 years ago for transportation, but now is being upgraded into a major aqueduct.\n\n\n\n\n## Climate[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  Beijing\n |\n| --- |\n| Climate chart (explanation) |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| J\n | F\n | M\n | A\n | M\n | J\n | J\n | A\n | S\n | O\n | N\n | D\n |\n| 2.7\n\n\n\n2\n\n−8\n | 4.9\n\n\n\n5\n\n−6\n | 8.3\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDowntown Beijing has several lakes called *hai* or sea.

Today, the three northernmost lakes, *Xihai* (West Sea), *Houhai* (Rear Sea) and *Qianhai* (Front Sea), collectively known as *Shichahai*, are lined with bars and cafés and known for nightlife. To their south, *Beihai* (North Sea) is a city park, and *Zhonghai* (Central Sea) and *Nanhai* (South Sea) are part of the Zhongnanhai Compound, residence to China's leaders. This string of lakes used to form the main riverbed of the Yongding River, which now flows 50–60 km (31–37 mi) to the west. But 1,800 years ago, the Yongding flowed through Jishuitan and downtown Beijing and then into Longtan Lake and on to Tongzhou.[6] A major flood in 295 A.D. devastated part of Beijing, then known as Ji. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nJust west of Wangfujing, there is still a stretch of Beijing called *Shatan* or Sandy Beach.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Tonghui canal, an extension of the Grand Canal, near Gaobeidian\n![](image)Kunming Lake in the Summer Palace\nToday, an aqueduct draws water from the Yongding through Yuyuantan Park to the western city moat, which empties into Liangshui River south of the city.

The municipality's outlying districts and counties extend into the mountains that surround the city from the southwest to the northeast. The highest peaks are over 2,000 m (6,600 ft).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHistorically, Beijing was situated on the border between sedentary agricultural areas to the south and pastoralist regions beyond the mountains to the north. The Great Wall of China was built across the mountains north of Beijing to guard against nomadic invasions. In modern times, the same mountains that shielded Beijing from the Gobi steppes also form a semi-circular basin which catches the city's air pollution. Severe smog problems develop in the summer as the hot and humid air pressure from monsoons in the south prevent air pollutants from leaving the basin. Smog is less severe in the fall and winter when the direction of the wind currents reverse course as the vast anticyclone high pressure system takes hold and brings cold, dry air from Siberia. In the spring, the northerly winds, pick up dust from desertifying areas of western China and bring occasionally severe dust storms to Beijing. The city's climate is characterized by hot, humid summers and cold, windy, and dry winters.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Topography of Beijing\nThe city of Beijing lies on low and flat land, with elevation generally between 40–60 metres (130–200 ft) above sea level.

Xishan forms the eastern flank of the Taihang Mountains range, which run north–south up the spine of Hebei province.[5] Xishan covers nearly all of Fangshan and Mentougou Districts west of the city. East Lingshan (elevation 2,303 metres (7,556 ft)), a Xishan peak on the border with Hebei, is the highest point in Beijing Municipality.[5] It is located 122 km (76 mi) from the city. Xishan is also known for high mountain meadows and scenic river gorges, including Shidu. Foothills of Xishan reach the city itself. They include Fragrant Hills, a major tourist attraction and Laoshan, the site of mountain bike competition in the 2008 Summer Olympics.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_mdKs8uesZyTuRcUkpKBryGpm","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
