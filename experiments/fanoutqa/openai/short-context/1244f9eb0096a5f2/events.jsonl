The first five confirmed cases were all individuals who had recently arrived from China.[3][4] A Chinese tourist who was admitted to hospital in Paris on 28 January 2020, died on 14 February 2020, becoming the first known COVID-19 fatality outside Asia as well as the first in France.[5][6][7][8] A key event in the spread of the disease across metropolitan France as well as its overseas territories was the annual assembly of the Christian Open Door Church between 17 and 24 February 2020 in Mulhouse which was attended by about 2,500 people, at least half of whom are believed to have contracted the virus.[9][10] On 4 May 2020, retroactive testing of samples in one French hospital showed that a patient was probably already infected with the virus on 27 December 2019, almost a month before the first officially confirmed case.[11][12]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe lockdown had initially been planned for 15 days, then for 30 days, but on 13 April 2020, Macron announced that the lockdown period would be extended until 11 May 2020.[13]\n\n\nOn 4 May 2020, scientists retesting old samples found that a man had been infected with COVID-19 on 27 December 2019, almost a month before France reported its first case. The patient had not travelled abroad which sparked fears that the coronavirus might have been spreading in Europe earlier than leaders had thought.\n\n\nOn 11 May 2020, as daily cases had dropped to under 100 per day, primary schools and some middle schools were allowed to reopen in what was the first steps to reopening the economy.\n\n\nOn 28 May 2020, Édouard Philippe announced that a travel ban of 100 km (62 miles) would be lifted on 2 June 2020. Cafes, bars and restaurants were also allowed to reopen on the same day. This easing of restrictions did not apply to Paris.\n\n\n\n### June–July 2020: Easing of restrictions[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n10. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** \"ENQUETE FRANCEINFO. \"La majorité des personnes étaient contaminées\" : de la Corse à l'outre-mer, comment le rassemblement évangélique de Mulhouse a diffusé le coronavirus dans toute la France\". *Franceinfo*. 28 March 2020.\n11. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Irish, John (4 May 2020). \"After retesting samples, French hospital discovers COVID-19 case from December\". *Reuters*.

The Russian government has also taken measures to prevent foreign citizens from heavily affected countries from visiting Russia.[*citation needed*] Local governments have also responded to the pandemic by imposing their own preventive measures in their communities.\n\n\n\n### Lockdowns[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Map of federal subjects that have announced the \"self-isolation regime\".

The virus was confirmed to have spread to Brazil on 25 February 2020,[4] when a man from São Paulo who had traveled to Italy[5] tested positive for the virus. The disease had spread to every federative unit of Brazil by 21 March. On 19 June 2020, the country reported its one millionth case and nearly 49,000 reported deaths.[6][7] One estimate of under-reporting was 22.62% of total reported COVID-19 mortality in 2020.[8][9][10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* **27 November:** Two raw sewage samples collected independently on 27 November 2019 in Santa Catarina, Brazil, will later detect SARS-CoV-2 (100,000 copies per litre), 66 days in advance of the first COVID-19 confirmed case in the Americas. Subsequent samplings are positive on 11 December 2019 and 20 February 2020. These samples can show that SARS-CoV-2 was circulating in Brazil at least as early as late November 2019.[18] However, this is highly contested by the scientific consensus which shows that the virus emerged in early December 2019 in Wuhan, China. Thus, it is highly unlikely that it was circulating in Brazil before early 2020.[19] Researchers from the Institute of Tropical Medicine and international colleagues showed in the scientific journal Science that the first sustained transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Brazil occurred between late February and early March 2020.[20]\n\n\n### 2020[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 20 March, experts from Italy warned that the coronavirus growth curve in Brazil would repeat that of European countries. An observatory with physicists from USP, University of Campinas, São Paulo State University, University of Brasília, Federal University of ABC, UC Berkeley and the University of Oldenburg showed that the number of infected people, considering data from 19 March, had been doubling every 54 hours, and that the case total would exceed 3,000 by the 24th.[157][158]\n\n\nOn 21 March, researchers began to mobilize to increase the availability of testing in Brazil. The Federal University of Rio de Janeiro was attempting to create a serology test, as opposed to the more common PCR test, to detect infections through a patient's blood samples.[159]\nMinister of Health Luiz Henrique Mandetta said that the number of cases would increase exponentially until the end of June.[160]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 25 February, the first confirmed COVID-19 case in Brazil (and the first in South America) was announced by the Health Department of São Paulo – a 61-year-old man who had returned from Lombardy, Italy.[28][29] A second case was confirmed soon after in another person who had recently returned from Italy.[30] On 28 February, scientists of the University of São Paulo's Tropical Medicine Institute and the Adolfo Lutz Institute reported that they had sequenced the genomes of these two cases, which had been separately introduced from Northern Italy to Brazil on two occasions.[31][32] In an address on 6 March, President Jair Bolsonaro advised residents to \"strictly follow the experts' recommendations as the best protective measure\", but that \"there is no reason to panic\".[33]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe virus had reached remote locations; a Yanomami teen died of it in Roraima.[51]\n* **14 April:** The Ministry of Health reported a total of 25,262 confirmed cases and 1,532 confirmed deaths. Over 14,000 people were declared recovered, although they were not confirmed virus-free, only discharged from a hospital or asymptomatic.[52]\n* **16 April:** President Bolsonaro fired the Minister of Health, Luiz Henrique Mandetta, over disagreements about social distancing guidelines.[53] He said he would appoint a health minister who favored reopening businesses \"as quickly as possible\".[54] Shortly afterwards, Nelson Teich was appointed to replace him.[55]\n* **20 April:** Several cities started to ease social isolation guidelines in favor of contact tracing. Some retail stores were allowed to open as long as customers wore masks, the number of in-person customers was reduced, and customer personal information was tracked.[*citation needed*]\n* **24 April:** Brazil confirmed more than fifty thousand cases.[56]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has triggered a variety of responses from federal, state and local governments, having an impact on politics, education, the environment,[11] and the economy. On 27 March 2020 Brazil announced a temporary ban on foreign air travelers[12] and most state governors have imposed quarantines to prevent the spread of the virus.[13] President Jair Bolsonaro has perpetuated conspiracy theories surrounding COVID-19 treatments[14] and its origins,[15] and was accused of downplaying effective mitigations and pursuing a strategy of herd immunity.[16] In October 2021, a congressional panel recommended criminal charges against the president for his handling of the pandemic, including crimes against humanity.[16]\n\n\nAs of 13 June 2024, Brazil, with 37,519,960[1] confirmed cases and 702,116[1] deaths, has the third-highest number of confirmed cases and second-highest death toll from COVID-19 in the world, behind only those of the United States and of India.\n\n\n\n\n## Timeline[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* **15 March:** *Brasil de Fato* reported the United States Department of Health and Human Services attempted to pressure the country not buy Sputnik V vaccine to diminish Russia's influence in the region.[119][120] This did not stop a consortium of Brazilian governors in some states from signing a 37 million dose purchase agreement.[121]\n* **17 March:** Brazilian Health Officials deem the Hospital crisis \"the worst in Brazil's history\".[122]\n* **19 March:** The ICUs of 16 Brazilian states were over 90% occupied, \"meaning those health systems have collapsed or are at imminent risk of doing so,\" according to CNN.[123]\n* **25 March:** Over 100,000 new COVID-19 cases were confirmed in a single day, the highest rate of diagnosis since the pandemic began.[124]\n* **31 March:** There is now a total of 12,753,258 cases and 321,886 deaths.[125]\n\n\n#### April[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n11. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Deforestation of Amazon rainforest accelerates amid COVID-19 pandemic\".

The Turkmenistan government has instead reported a large increase in atypical pneumonia cases.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nCOVID-19 cases and deaths by region, in absolute figures and rates per million inhabitants as of 25 December 2022[29]\n| Region[30] | Total cases\n | Total deaths\n | Cases per million\n | Deaths per million\n | Current weekly cases\n | Current weekly deaths\n | Population millions\n | Vaccinated %[31] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| European Union | 179,537,758 | 1,185,108 | 401,363 | 2,649 | 886,074 | 3,985 | 447 | 75.1\n |\n| North America | 103,783,777 | 1,133,607 | 281,404 | 3,074 | 476,376 | 2,975 | 369 | 76.1\n |\n| Other Europe | 57,721,948 | 498,259 | 247,054 | 2,133 | 74,354 | 248 | 234 | 61.2\n |\n| South America | 65,835,789 | 1,313,061 | 153,151 | 3,055 | 378,622 | 1,252 | 430 | 81.7\n |\n| Russia and Central Asia\n | 25,646,533 | 434,988 | 108,307 | 1,837 | 49,022 | 393 | 237 | 55.9\n |\n| Central America\n | 11,338,600 | 380,660 | 63,108 | 2,119 | 60,268 | 263 | 180 | 69.0\n |\n| Middle East\n | 22,549,784 | 238,106 | 86,400 | 912 | 13,457 | 65 | 261 | 51.9\n |\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_QoT3M26ZvsajLoUlHaOSNCJf","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
