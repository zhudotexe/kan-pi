Harding[3] and Franklin D. Roosevelt), four were assassinated (Abraham Lincoln,[4] James A. Garfield,[4][5] William McKinley[6] and John F. Kennedy) and one resigned from office (Richard Nixon).[7]\n\n\nWilliam Henry Harrison spent the shortest time in office, while Franklin D. Roosevelt spent the longest. Roosevelt is the only American president to have served more than two terms. Following ratification of the Twenty-second Amendment in 1951, presidents\u2014beginning with Dwight D. Eisenhower\u2014have been ineligible for election to a third term or, after serving more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected president, to a second term. The amendment contained a grandfather clause that explicitly exempted the incumbent president, then Harry S. Truman, from the new term limitations.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Vice presidents | * Age\n* Burial places\n* Coats of arms\n* Education\n* Families\n\t+ spouses\n\t+ children\n* Home state\n* Impeachment efforts\n* Other offices held\n* Ran for president\n* Religious affiliation\n* Slave owners\n* Tie-breaking votes\n* Time in office\n* U.S. Senate bust collection\n |\n| Succession | * Acting presidents\n* Designated survivors\n* Inaugurations\n* Transitions\n |\n| Elections | * Electoral College margin\n* Popular vote margin\n* Winner lost popular vote\n |\n| Candidates | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Political affiliation | * Democratic\n* Democratic-Republican\n* Federalist\n* Green\n* Libertarian\n* National Republican\u00a0/ Whig\n* Republican\n* Third party\u00a0/ independent\n |\n| Distinctions | * African American\n* Campaign slogans\n* Female\n* Firsts\n* Height\n* Lost their home state\n* Number of votes received\n\t+ in primaries\n* Received at least one electoral vote\n* Unsuccessful major party presidential candidates\n* Unsuccessful major party vice presidential candidates\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Rank | President | Length*in days* | Order of presidency | Number of terms\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Franklin D.
