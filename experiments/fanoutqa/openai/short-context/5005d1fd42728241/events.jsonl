Apple Music released its \"Replay\" playlist feature in 2019, accessible throughout the year, then redesigned \"Replay\" in 2022 to incorporate more interactive elements akin to Wrapped.[28][29] Tidal launched its \"My Rewind\" feature in 2020, which is available on the 1st of December every year alongside a curated \"Best of\" series.[30] YouTube Music started rolling out the \"Your Music Journey\" email and playlist feature in 2020, before releasing the Recap feature in 2021; in 2022 a seasonal recap feature was introduced.[31] Deezer's \"#MyDeezerYear\" feature was introduced in 2021.[32]\n\n\n\n### By the marketing industry[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe release of Spotify Wrapped in early December each year has historically correlated with a boost to Spotify's app store ranking.[19] Users' emotional responses to Spotify Wrapped vary. Some express excitement about the opportunity to share their own statistics, while others find the data embarrassing.[20]\n\n\n\n### On social media[edit]\n\n\nIn 2018, Spotify's customer support account on Twitter received a large number of messages from people complaining about their Spotify Wrapped results, believing them to be wrong or unfair.[5]\n\n\nIn December 2019, more than 1,200,000 posts on Twitter were about Spotify Wrapped after it came out near the beginning of the month.[1][4]\n\n\n\n### In media[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_Yu3B6C2JoY8EjlWkUsjIgEN2","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
