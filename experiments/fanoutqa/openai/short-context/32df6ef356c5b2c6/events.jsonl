They set their own academic standards and manage their own budgets. The president, however, plays an important part in university-wide planning and strategy. Each names a faculty's dean (and, since the foundation of the office in 1994, the university's provost), and grants tenure to recommended professors; however, the president is expected to make such decisions after extensive consultation with faculty members.\n\n\nHarvard presidents have traditionally influenced educational practices nationwide. Charles W. Eliot, for example, originated America's familiar system of a smorgasbord of elective courses available to each student;[2] James B. Conant worked to introduce standardized testing; Derek Bok and Neil L. Rudenstine argued for the continued importance of diversity in higher education.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRecently, however, the job has become increasingly administrative, especially as fund-raising campaigns have taken on central importance in large institutions such as Harvard. Some have criticized this trend to the extent it has prevented the president from focusing on substantive issues in higher education.[3]\n\n\nEach president is professor in some department of the university and teaches from time to time.\n\n\nHarvard's current president is Claudine Gay, having become Harvard's 30th president on July 1, 2023.[4]\n\n\nShe succeeded Lawrence Bacow who retired on June 30, 2023.[5]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nAt Harvard's founding it was headed by a \"schoolmaster,\" Nathaniel Eaton. In 1640, when Henry Dunster was brought in, he adopted the title president. The origins of this title have been grounds for a certain amount of speculation.\n\n\nHarvard was founded for the training of Puritan clergy, and even though its mission was soon broadened, nearly all presidents through the end of the 18th century were in holy orders.\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_1Oj324W6Hp9HILYK2tiFgVvb","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

Bill) and the increased complexity of higher education administration led many chief executive officers to adopt a more corporate governing structure. By the 1960s, many private research universities had provosts installed as their chief academic officers, including Brown (1949),[30] Chicago (1963),[31] Cornell (1931),[32] Dartmouth (1955; in abeyance 1972–79),[33] Duke (1960),[34] Johns Hopkins (1924),[35] MIT (1949),[36] Princeton (1966),[37] Rice (1954),[38] Stanford (1952),[39] Tufts (1951),[40] Wake Forest (1967)[41] and Yale (1919).[42] Harvard was a notable holdout: a provost had been appointed in 1933, but only with authority over the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, and the position had been eliminated in 1953. It was not until 1995 that Harvard appointed a university-wide provost.[43][44]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe establishment of provosts as the chief academic officers of universities in the US began in the first half of the 20th century. The first use of the title in American higher education was in 1754 at the University (then the College) of Pennsylvania. The post was created under Benjamin Franklin as president of the board of trustees, and while Franklin was in this position he remained heavily involved in the college. However, on Franklin's retirement in 1755 the provost took up the more usual (at the time) role of head of the college, which it retained until the re-establishment of the presidency of the university in 1930.[28] At Columbia University, the board of trustees established the office of provost in 1811 as a political compromise; it was abolished five years later when the holder departed. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n27. **^** John Hayward. \"Breaking the mould: The surprising story of Stockton\" (PDF). p. 82.

Like the President, the Provost is a distinguished academic who upholds Imperial's very high standards for the core academic mission. He has direct responsibility for the major academic units (via the Faculty Deans) and the teaching and research mission via the Vice-Provosts (Education and Research and Innovation). The Provost also has responsibility for human – as well as intellectual – resources, with responsibility for promoting an inclusive and excellent staff and student community.\n> \n> \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe use of provost as the title of the chief academic officer of a university (as opposed to its historic use for the head of a college) is relatively recent in the UK. One of the earliest was Imperial College London, where the first provost was appointed in 2012, splitting off the chief academic officer role previously carried out by the rector (chief executive) of the university after a governance review.[45] The vice-chancellor (chief executive) of Durham University praised this arrangement in 2014, following a governance review that recommended it at that university, saying \"The Vice-Chancellor's role in an international university like this now is something that cannot be done by one person with all the external and internal stuff you have to do. In America it's been the case all the time that they've had a president and a provost, with the president being the equivalent of Vice-Chancellor. This more or less splits the external and internal duties. \n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_jhz5gN67D1DjuttEZLoIfhav","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

Bill) and the increased complexity of higher education administration led many chief executive officers to adopt a more corporate governing structure. By the 1960s, many private research universities had provosts installed as their chief academic officers, including Brown (1949),[30] Chicago (1963),[31] Cornell (1931),[32] Dartmouth (1955; in abeyance 1972–79),[33] Duke (1960),[34] Johns Hopkins (1924),[35] MIT (1949),[36] Princeton (1966),[37] Rice (1954),[38] Stanford (1952),[39] Tufts (1951),[40] Wake Forest (1967)[41] and Yale (1919).[42] Harvard was a notable holdout: a provost had been appointed in 1933, but only with authority over the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, and the position had been eliminated in 1953. It was not until 1995 that Harvard appointed a university-wide provost.[43][44]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n27. **^** John Hayward. \"Breaking the mould: The surprising story of Stockton\" (PDF). p. 82.

The first use of the title in American higher education was in 1754 at the University (then the College) of Pennsylvania. The post was created under Benjamin Franklin as president of the board of trustees, and while Franklin was in this position he remained heavily involved in the college. However, on Franklin's retirement in 1755 the provost took up the more usual (at the time) role of head of the college, which it retained until the re-establishment of the presidency of the university in 1930.[28] At Columbia University, the board of trustees established the office of provost in 1811 as a political compromise; it was abolished five years later when the holder departed. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n60. **^** \"Annual Report 2020/21 and Financial Statements to 31 July 2021\" (PDF).

Like the President, the Provost is a distinguished academic who upholds Imperial's very high standards for the core academic mission. He has direct responsibility for the major academic units (via the Faculty Deans) and the teaching and research mission via the Vice-Provosts (Education and Research and Innovation). The Provost also has responsibility for human – as well as intellectual – resources, with responsibility for promoting an inclusive and excellent staff and student community.\n> \n> \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe use of provost as the title of the chief academic officer of a university (as opposed to its historic use for the head of a college) is relatively recent in the UK. One of the earliest was Imperial College London, where the first provost was appointed in 2012, splitting off the chief academic officer role previously carried out by the rector (chief executive) of the university after a governance review.[45] The vice-chancellor (chief executive) of Durham University praised this arrangement in 2014, following a governance review that recommended it at that university, saying \"The Vice-Chancellor's role in an international university like this now is something that cannot be done by one person with all the external and internal stuff you have to do. In America it's been the case all the time that they've had a president and a provost, with the president being the equivalent of Vice-Chancellor. This more or less splits the external and internal duties. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nProvosts are often chosen by a search committee made up of faculty members, and are almost always drawn from the 'tenured faculty' or 'professional administrators' with academic credentials, either at the institution or from other institutions.\n\n\n\n## Titles and other uses[edit]\n\n\nAt some North American research universities and liberal arts colleges, other titles may be used in place of or in combination with provost, such as chief academic officer or vice president for academic affairs (or, rarely, academic vice-president, academic vice rector, or vice president for education). At smaller independent liberal arts colleges, the chief academic officer may carry the title \"dean of the college\" or \"dean of the faculty\" in addition to or instead of *provost*. For example, at Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut, the dean of the faculty is also the vice president for academic affairs and is the second-highest administrator, directly beneath the president.\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_9uko2r8mcDjKERuKzD6UmoxP","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

Bill) and the increased complexity of higher education administration led many chief executive officers to adopt a more corporate governing structure. By the 1960s, many private research universities had provosts installed as their chief academic officers, including Brown (1949),[30] Chicago (1963),[31] Cornell (1931),[32] Dartmouth (1955; in abeyance 1972–79),[33] Duke (1960),[34] Johns Hopkins (1924),[35] MIT (1949),[36] Princeton (1966),[37] Rice (1954),[38] Stanford (1952),[39] Tufts (1951),[40] Wake Forest (1967)[41] and Yale (1919).[42] Harvard was a notable holdout: a provost had been appointed in 1933, but only with authority over the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, and the position had been eliminated in 1953. It was not until 1995 that Harvard appointed a university-wide provost.[43][44]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n27. **^** John Hayward. \"Breaking the mould: The surprising story of Stockton\" (PDF). p. 82.

At smaller independent liberal arts colleges, the chief academic officer may carry the title \"dean of the college\" or \"dean of the faculty\" in addition to or instead of *provost*. For example, at Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut, the dean of the faculty is also the vice president for academic affairs and is the second-highest administrator, directly beneath the president.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe establishment of provosts as the chief academic officers of universities in the US began in the first half of the 20th century. The first use of the title in American higher education was in 1754 at the University (then the College) of Pennsylvania. The post was created under Benjamin Franklin as president of the board of trustees, and while Franklin was in this position he remained heavily involved in the college. However, on Franklin's retirement in 1755 the provost took up the more usual (at the time) role of head of the college, which it retained until the re-establishment of the presidency of the university in 1930.[28] At Columbia University, the board of trustees established the office of provost in 1811 as a political compromise; it was abolished five years later when the holder departed. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe title \"provost\" (Latin: *praepositus*) has been used in England from medieval times for the head of colleges such as Oriel College, Oxford[23] and Eton College.[24] More recent colleges have adopted the same usage, e.g. the principal of University College London was retitled as provost in 1906,[25] and Durham University adopted the title for University College Stockton in 1999 (until it was split into two new colleges in 2001).[26][27]\n\n\nFollowing its usage for the heads of colleges, some multi-campus state university systems in the United States have used *provost* as the title of the head of a branch campus. For example, the chancellors of the Newark and Camden campuses of Rutgers University in New Jersey were formerly known as provosts.[*citation needed*] A similar practice arose in Britain in the early 21st century with the establishment of international branch campuses, many of which were headed by provosts.[12][13][14][15][20][17][18][19]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe use of provost as the title of the chief academic officer of a university (as opposed to its historic use for the head of a college) is relatively recent in the UK. One of the earliest was Imperial College London, where the first provost was appointed in 2012, splitting off the chief academic officer role previously carried out by the rector (chief executive) of the university after a governance review.[45] The vice-chancellor (chief executive) of Durham University praised this arrangement in 2014, following a governance review that recommended it at that university, saying \"The Vice-Chancellor's role in an international university like this now is something that cannot be done by one person with all the external and internal stuff you have to do. In America it's been the case all the time that they've had a president and a provost, with the president being the equivalent of Vice-Chancellor. This more or less splits the external and internal duties. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSome of these used the title *provost* on its own,[45][49][50][51] others used *provost* in combination with another title indicating that they were deputy to the chief executive officer),[20][21][48][52][53][54] while both King's College London and Southampton eschewed the title *provost* in favour of *Senior Vice-President (Academic)*[55][56] and Glasgow used *Senior Vice Principal and Deputy Vice Chancellor (Academic)*.[57] The London School of Economics appointed a provost and deputy director in 2013 but, after the holder left in 2015, no longer have the position in their management structure.[58][59] However, only a few of the Russell Group universities with provosts (including Imperial,[1] Durham,[48] Edinburgh[51] and Bristol[54]) explicitly identified the provost as being the chief academic officer, and Exeter[60] and Sheffield[61] continued to explicitly identify the chief executive officer as the chief academic officer.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Trustees and the president of the university re-established the office of provost in 1912 as the chief academic officer, who \"would be associated with the President and the Secretary of the university in the consideration and oversight of matters of general university concern and in the preparation of general university business for consideration either by the Trustees, the University Council, or the appropriate Faculty.\" It fell vacant again between 1926 and 1937, but on its restoration was seen as the second officer in the administration, behind only the president.[29]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n45. ^ ***a*** ***b*** John-Paul Jones (12 December 2012). \"James Stirling to be Imperial's first Provost\".

She served as president of the University of Chicago, from 1978 to 1993, having earlier served as acting president of Yale University in 1977–1978. At both schools, she was the first woman to hold their highest executive office. When named to the post in Chicago, she became one of the first women in the United States to hold the full presidency of a major university.\n\n\n\n\n## Biography[edit]\n\n\nHolborn was born in Heidelberg, Germany, the daughter of Hajo Holborn, a professor of European history at Yale who fled to America from Nazi Germany, and Annemarie Bettmann, a philologist.[1] Her older brother, Frederick, became a White House aide and professor of foreign policy at Johns Hopkins' School of Advanced International Studies.[2]\n\n\nGray attended The Foote School in New Haven, Connecticut (graduated 1943), Sidwell Friends School in Washington D.C, then Bryn Mawr College in suburban Philadelphia, where she graduated in 1950.[*citation needed*] She traveled to Oxford as a Fulbright Scholar. She earned a PhD from Harvard in 1957, and taught there, becoming an assistant professor in 1959.[*citation needed*] At Harvard, her experiences were circumscribed by her \"outsider status\" as a woman.[3] Although technically coeducational in some graduate programs by the 1950s, women were mostly relegated to the \"separate, but not equal\" Radcliffe College. When Gray became the first and only woman tutor in history and literature, she was reluctantly allowed into the tutor's dining society but was distinctly unwelcome by the other tutors. Similarly, when Gray advanced to instructor, as a woman, she was forbidden in the main faculty hall and was required to enter through the side door, although she decided to just go in the front door, anyway. (She took her cue from Harvard professor, Helen Maud Cam, who earlier in the decade became the first woman to attend faculty morning services in the over 300 years of the institution just by showing up every day and sitting down).[3]\n\n\nGray moved to Chicago when her husband was appointed to a position at the University of Chicago. She spent her first year as a research fellow at the Newberry Library, and then began teaching history at Chicago earning tenure in 1964. From 1966 to 1970, she was co-editor of the *Journal of Modern History* with her husband.[4] Gray was named dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at Northwestern University in 1972 and became professor of history and provost at Yale University in 1974.[5] She served as acting president of Yale for fourteen months after President Kingman Brewster unexpectedly accepted an appointment as United States Ambassador to the Court of St. James's.[6]\n\n\nGray then returned to the University of Chicago, serving as president from 1978 to 1993, the first female (full) president of a major university in the United States.[7] In 1991, she was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.[8] She retired in June 1993 but remains *Harry Pratt Judson Distinguished Service Professor Emerita*.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nGray has also served as a director, board member or trustee of the Harvard Corporation, the Yale Corporation, the Smithsonian Institution, JP Morgan Chase, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, the Marlboro School of Music, the Council on Foreign Relations, the Concord Coalition, the Mayo Clinic, the Brookings Institution, and Bryn Mawr College. Gray has received honorary degrees from more than sixty institutions, including the University of Chicago, The College of William and Mary, Harvard, Oxford, Yale, Brown, Columbia, Princeton, and Duke. She served as chairman of the board of the second largest foundation in America, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, until 2010.[9] The portrait of Gray that hangs at the University of Chicago has been \"stolen\" (and returned) on more than one occasion as a student prank.[10] Gray published a memoir, *An Academic Life*, in 2018.\n\n\n\n## Honors[edit]\n\n\n* Medal of Liberty\n* Presidential Medal of Freedom\n* Francis Boyer Award\n* Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement[11]\n* member, American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1973)[1]\n* member, American Philosophical Society (1981)[2]\n\n\n## Chronology[edit]\n\n\n* Teaching Fellow, Harvard University, 1955–1957\n* Instructor, Harvard University, 1957–1959\n* Assistant Professor, Harvard University, 1959–1960\n* Assistant Professor of History at the University of Chicago 1961–1964\n* Associate Professor of History at the University of Chicago 1964–1972\n* Professor and Dean, Northwestern University 1972–1974\n* Professor and Provost at Yale University 1974–1978\n* Acting President of Yale University 1977–1978\n* Professor of History at the University of Chicago 1978–present\n* President of the University of Chicago 1978–1993\n* Appointed to the Harvard Corporation, 1997\n\n\n## Works and publications[edit]\n\n\n* Hanna Holborn Gray, \"Some Reflections on the Second Generation.\" *The Second Generation.
