Each architect worked on a theme; Gringo Cardia (from Brazil) focused on “defending human dignity”, Shigeru Ban (from Japan) focused on “refusing fatality” and Kéré selected the theme “reconstructing the family link”.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nKéré was born in the village of Gando, Burkina Faso. He was the first child in the village to be sent to school as his father, the village chief, wanted his eldest son to learn how to read and translate his letters. Since no school existed in Gando, Kéré had to leave his family when he was 7 years old to live with his uncle in the city. After finishing his education, he became a carpenter and received a scholarship from the Carl Duisberg Society to do an apprenticeship in Germany as a supervisor in development aid. After completing the apprenticeship, he went on to study architecture at the Technical University of Berlin, graduating in 2004.[4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nPritzker Architecture Prize laureates\n |\n| --- |\n| * Philip Johnson (1979)\n* Luis Barragán (1980)\n* James Stirling (1981)\n* Kevin Roche (1982)\n* I.

In 1998, with the help of his friends, Kéré set up the association Schulbausteine für Gando e.V. (now Kéré Foundation), which loosely translates as \"Building Blocks for Gando\", to fund the construction of a primary school for his village. His objective was to combine the knowledge he had gained in Europe, with traditional building methods from Burkina Faso.

Many of his notable designs are structures which are temporary, prefabricated, or incorporate inexpensive and unconventional materials in innovative ways. He was profiled by *Time* magazine in their projection of 21st-century innovators in the field of architecture and design.[3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBan was born in Tokyo Japan. He studied at the Southern California Institute of Architecture. Later he went to Cooper Union's School of Architecture, where he studied under John Hejduk and graduated in 1984.[2] From Hejduk (who was a part of the New York Five), Ban gained an interest in \"architectonic poetics\" or the creation of \"three-dimensional poetry\". Hejduk, the most experimentally minded of the New York Five,[*citation needed*] had a lasting influence on Ban, whose work reflects continuing explorations into basic geometric elements.[*citation needed*] Ban's formal explorations with basic building materials helped to lead him into unique structural solutions.\n\n\n\n## Design approach[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDue to the strict building codes in Germany and the unconventional use of paper as a revolutionary building material, the Japanese Pavilion had to be over-designed and incorporate wooden elements, thus, becoming more of a hybrid structure. An innovative design feature was Ban's use of recyclable wooden boxes filled with sand instead of a concrete foundation.[11]*pg33*\n\n\n\n## Nepal Project[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2015, Ban began a project to rebuild homes for the victims of that year's Nepal earthquake.[15] The structures of the homes are wood framed for flexibility and built fully with brick walls. The homes are thus quickly and easily built. Also, the Nepalese can use them for many other purposes, such as schools.\n\n\n\n## Teaching[edit]\n\n\nBan is currently a professor at Keio University. Previously, he taught at institutions including Harvard University, Columbia University, Cornell University, Kyoto University of Art and Design, Nihon University, Tama Art University, and Yokohama National University.[16]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nPritzker Architecture Prize laureates\n |\n| --- |\n| * Philip Johnson (1979)\n* Luis Barragán (1980)\n* James Stirling (1981)\n* Kevin Roche (1982)\n* I.

The 72-metre-long gridshell structure was made with paper tubes. But due to stringent building laws in Germany, the roof had to be reinforced with a substructure. After the exhibition the structure was recycled and returned to paper pulp.[6]\n\n\nBan fits well into the category of \"Ecological Architects\" but he also can make solid claims for being modernist, a Japanese experimentalist, as well as a rationalist. Natias Neutert, German thinker, critic, and poet, marks Ban in his essay as \"a gentle revolutionary ... guiding contemporary architecture towards transparency, the spherical and the open\".[7] \nBan himself quotes: \"I don't like waste\", summing up his philosophy and practice, known as \"Paper Architecture\".\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBan's work encompasses several schools of architecture. First he is a Japanese architect, and uses many themes and methods found in traditional Japanese architecture (such as shōji) and the idea of a \"universal floor\" to allow continuity between all rooms in a house. In his buildings, this translates to a floor without change in elevation. By choosing to study under Hejduk, Ban opted to do something different. Hejduk's rationalist views on architecture provided a way of revisiting Western modernism and gaining a richer appreciation than the reductive vision of it as a rationalized version of the traditionalist—yet ultra-modern—Japanese space. With his Western education and influences, Ban has become one of the forerunning Japanese architects who embrace the expression of Western and Eastern building forms and methods. Perhaps most influential from Hejduk was the study of the structure of architectural systems. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBan is most famous now for his innovative work with paper and cardboard tubing as a building material. He was the first architect in Japan to construct a building primarily out of paper with his paper house, and required special approval for his building to pass Japan's building code. Ban is attracted to using paper because it is low cost, recyclable, low-tech and replaceable. The last aspect of Ban's influences is his humanitarianism and his attraction to ecological architecture. Ban's work with paper and other materials is heavily based on its sustainability and because it produces very little waste.

That is, he does not overly express his structural elements, but rather chooses to incorporate them into the design. Ban is not interested in the newest materials and techniques, but rather the expression of the concept behind his building. He deliberately chooses materials to further this expression.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn June 2020, he and other architects, as well as chefs, Nobel laureates in Economics and leaders of international organizations, signed the appeal in favour of the purple economy (“Towards a cultural renaissance of the economy”), published in *Corriere della Sera*,[8] *El País*[9] and *Le Monde*.[10]\n\n\n\n## Use of paper as a building material[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Construction details of the Cardboard Cathedral; cardboard, wood and glass\nBan's experimental development of paper tubing structures came in 1986, before any of his programmatic commissions. He found paper's structural integrity to be much better than expected and noted that it is also available all around the world. The structures are most commonly available from manufacturers providing paper tubes for use in textile factories, as in the case with the disaster relief shelters project in Ahmedabad, India.[11]*pg29*\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n8. **^** \"Per un rinascimento culturale dell'economia\". *Corriere della Sera* (in Italian). 7 June 2020.

The 16-square-metre (172 sq ft) modules have paper tubing for walls, with small ventilation gaps between the members, which can also be taped up to insulate.[13]*pg174*The roof was made from a waterproof tenting material while the foundation consisted of donated beer crates filled with sandbags.[14]*pg107*\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBan's interest in using existing materials aligned with his minimalist ideology.

In this project straight paper tube joists were connected by laminated timber joints. Although the joints were expensive, the low price of the paper tubing made for an inexpensive overall budget.[11]*pg32* In addition, the 6-foot (1.8 m) paper tubes were waterproofed with liquid urethane to minimize expansion and contraction due to humidity variances found in Osaka-Cho Japan.[14]*pg93*\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Centre Pompidou-Metz, France\n![](image)Aspen Art Museum at dusk\n* Furniture House, a series of prefabricated homes built in Japan, China, and the US and Metal Shutter House\n* Curtain Wall House (1995), Itabashi, Tokyo, Japan\n* Naked House (2000), Kawagoe, Saitama prefecture, Japan\n* Japanese Pavilion (2000) at Hannover World Exhibition Expo 2000, Hannover, Germany\n* Nomadic Museum (2005–present), built to house Gregory Colbert's video/photo work \"Ashes and Snow\"\n* Takatori Catholic Church, Kobe, Japan\n* Paper Dome, Nantou, Taiwan\n* Picture Window House, Shizuoka, Japan\n* Centre Pompidou-Metz museum, Metz, France\n* Luxurious villa designs Maison S und Maison H on an exclusive private island: Mandarin Oriental Dellis Cay\n* Cardboard Cathedral, Christchurch, New Zealand (2012–2013)[17]\n* Aspen Art Museum, US[1]\n* Bamboo Furniture House, Great Wall, China\n* Ōita Prefectural Art Museum, Ōita-shi, Japan\n* Onagawa Station, Onagawa, Miyagi, Japan\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_mkueeiq7TaKd7gUI3bO3wvmk","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

J. School of Art in Mumbai between 1947 and 1950.[12]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### Early projects[edit]\n\n\nIn 1950, he went to Europe. He worked closely with Le Corbusier on the latter's projects in Paris between 1951 and 1954. In 1954, he returned to India to supervise Corbusier's buildings in Ahmedabad, which included the Villa Sarabhai, Villa Shodhan, Mill Owners' Association Building, and Sanskar Kendra. Corbusier is described as having been a major influence on Doshi's later work.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nApart from his international fame as an architect, Doshi is equally known for having been an educator and institution builder. He was the founding director of the School of Architecture, Ahmedabad (1962–72), founding director of the School of Planning (1972–79), founding dean of the Centre for Environmental Planning and Technology (1972–81), founding member of the Visual Arts Centre, Ahmedabad, and founding director of the Kanoria Centre for Arts, Ahmedabad. [13]\n\n\nDoshi was instrumental in establishing the nationally- and internationally-known research institute Vastu-Shilpa Foundation for Studies and Research in Environmental Design. The institute has performed pioneering work in low-cost housing and city planning.[14] He is noteworthy for his pioneering work on low-income housing, and for his designs that incorporate concepts of sustainability in innovative ways.[14]\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n### Media[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n30. **^** \"9 iconic buildings designed by BV Doshi\". *Architectural Digest India*. 26 August 2017.
