Every person who has been nominated to the Court has been an attorney.[1]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAssociate Justice James F. Byrnes, whose short tenure lasted from June 1941 to October 1942, was the last Justice without a law degree to be appointed; Stanley Forman Reed, who served on the Court from 1938 to 1957, was the last sitting Justice from such a background. In total, of the 114 justices appointed to the Court, 49 have had law degrees, an additional 18 attended some law school but did not receive a degree, and 47 received their legal education without any law school attendance.[2]\n\n\nCurrently serving justices are listed in **bold** below.\n\n\n\n\n## Four or more justices[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Brigham Young University\n\t+ George Sutherland – also attended University of Michigan Law School\n* Carleton College\n\t+ Pierce Butler\n* Case Western Reserve University\n\t+ John Hessin Clarke\n* College of William & Mary\n\t+ John Marshall – Chief Justice\n\t+ Philip P.
