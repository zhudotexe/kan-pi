His father took interest in cultivating and educating the young Warren's curiosity surrounding the subject of business and investing, even at one point taking him to visit the New York Stock Exchange when he was 10.[20] At 11, he bought three shares of Cities Service Preferred for himself, and three for his sister Doris Buffett (who also became a philanthropist).[21][22][23] At 15, Warren made more than $175 monthly delivering *Washington Post* newspapers. In high school, he invested in a business owned by his father and bought a 40-acre farm worked by a tenant farmer.[24] He bought the land when he was 14 years old with $1,200 of his savings.[24] By the time he finished college, Buffett had amassed $9,800 in savings (about $125,000 today).[19][25]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWarren Edward Buffett was born on 30 August 1930 in Omaha, Nebraska, as the second of three children and the only son of Leila (n\u00e9e Stahl) and Congressman Howard Buffett.[13] He began his education at Rose Hill Elementary School. In 1942, his father was elected to the first of four terms in the United States Congress, and after moving with his family to Washington, D.C., Warren finished elementary school, attended Alice Deal Junior High School and graduated from what was then Woodrow Wilson High School in 1947, where his senior yearbook picture reads: \"likes math; a future stockbroker\".[14] After finishing high school and finding success with his side entrepreneurial and investment ventures, Buffett wanted to skip college to go directly into business but was overruled by his father.[15][16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWarren Buffett continues to help fund and support his family's individual foundations which include Susan Buffett's *Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation*, Susan Alice Buffett's *Sherwood Foundation*, Howard Graham Buffett's *Howard G.

He also transferred 300,000 Class B shares each to three funds managed by his children: the Sherwood Foundation, the Howard G. Buffett Foundation and the NoVo Foundation.[175]\n\n\nAs of 2023[update], Buffett has given over $50 billion to charitable causes.[176][177]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n12. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"US billionaires pledge 50% of their wealth to charity\".

He purchased a five-bedroom stucco house in Omaha, where he still lives, for $31,500.[37][38] In 1958 the Buffetts' third child, Peter Andrew, was born. Buffett operated five partnerships that year. In 1959, the company grew to six partnerships and Buffett met future partner Charlie Munger. By 1960, Buffett operated seven investment partnerships. He asked one of his partners, a doctor, to find ten other doctors willing to invest $10,000 each in his partnership. Eventually, eleven agreed, and Buffett pooled their money with a mere $100 original investment of his own.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBuffett married Susan Buffett (born Thompson) in 1952. They had three children, Susie, Howard and Peter. The couple began living separately in 1977, although they remained married until Susan Buffett's death in July 2004. Their daughter, Susie, lives in Omaha, is a national board member of Girls, Inc., and does charitable work through the Susan A. Buffett Foundation.[102]\n\n\nIn 2006, on his 76th birthday, Buffett married his longtime companion, Astrid Menks, who was then 60 years old\u2014she had lived with him since his wife's departure to San Francisco in 1977.[103][104] Susan had arranged for the two to meet before she left Omaha to pursue her singing career.

Graham was adamant that stock picks should provide a wide margin of safety after weighing the trade-off between their price and their intrinsic value. That same year the Buffetts had their second child, Howard Graham. In 1956, Benjamin Graham retired and closed his partnership.
