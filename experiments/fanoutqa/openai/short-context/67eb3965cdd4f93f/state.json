Permitted grapes are Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Merlot, Petit Verdot, Malbec and Carm\u00e9n\u00e8re.[13] Today Carm\u00e9n\u00e8re is rarely used, with Ch\u00e2teau Clerc Milon, a fifth growth Bordeaux, being one of the few to still retain Carm\u00e9n\u00e8re vines. As of July 2019, Bordeaux wineries authorized the use of four new red grapes to combat effects of climate change on viticulture in Bordeaux. These newly approved grapes are Marselan, Touriga Nacional, Castets, and Arinarnoa.[14][15]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs the largest appellation producing fine wines, and the strong foundation of the pyramid of Bordeaux wines, Bordeaux AOC & Bordeaux Sup\u00e9rieur AOC today account for 55% of all Bordeaux wines consumed in the world.\n\n\n\n### Plan Bordeaux[edit]\n\n\nPlan Bordeaux was an initiative introduced in 2005 by ONIVINS, the French vintners association, designed to reduce France's wine production in order to improve profitability for the remaining producers. Part of the plan was to uproot 17,000 hectares of the 124,000 hectares of vineyards in Bordeaux.[32] The wine industry in Bordeaux has been experiencing economic problems in the face of strong international competition from New World wines and declining wine consumption in France.[33]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn Bordeaux the concept of *terroir* plays a pivotal role in wine production with the top estates aiming to make *terroir* driven wines that reflect the place they are from, often from grapes collected from a single vineyard.[11] The soil of Bordeaux is composed of gravel, sandy stone, and clay. The region's best vineyards are located on the well-drained gravel soils that are frequently found near the Gironde river. An old adage in Bordeaux is the best estates can \"see the river\" from their vineyards. The majority of land facing riverward is occupied by classified estates.[11]\n\n\n\n## Grapes[edit]\n\n\n### Reds[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNew reforms for the regional appellations were instituted in 2008 by the Bordeaux and Bordeaux Sup\u00e9rieur Winemakers' Association. In 2010, 55% of all Bordeaux wines sold in the world were from Bordeaux and Bordeaux Sup\u00e9rieur AOCs, with 67% sold in France and 33% exported (+9%), representing 14 bottles consumed per second.[17][18]\n* *Red C\u00f4tes de Bordeaux*. Eight appellations are in the hilly outskirts of the region, and produce wines where the blend usually is dominated by Merlot. These wines tend to be intermediate between basic red Bordeaux and the more famous appellations of the left and right bank in both style and quality. However, since none of Bordeaux's stellar names are situated in C\u00f4tes de Bordeaux, prices tend to be moderate. There is no official classification in C\u00f4tes de Bordeaux.[19] In 2007, 14.7% of the region's vineyard surface was used for wines in this family.[17]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n20. **^** \"The 60 Appellations \u2013 Saint-Emilion, Pomerol, Fronsac\". *Vins de Bordeaux (CIVB)*.

The vast majority of wine produced in Bordeaux is red (sometimes called \"claret\" in Britain), with sweet white wines (most notably Sauternes), dry whites, and (in much smaller quantities) ros\u00e9 and sparkling wines (Cr\u00e9mant de Bordeaux) collectively making up the remainder. Bordeaux wine is made by more than 5,660 producers or *ch\u00e2teaux*. There are 65 appellations of Bordeaux wine.[2][3]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Map of the French provinces (including Bordeaux) assimilated by the Plantagenet-Aquitaine union\nMain article: History of Bordeaux wine\n\nViticulture was introduced into the Bordeaux region by the  Romans, probably in the mid-1st century CE,[4]\nto provide wine for local consumption, and wine production has been continuous in the region since then.[5][*need quotation to verify*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs a broad generalisation, Cabernet Sauvignon (Bordeaux's second-most planted grape variety) dominates the blend in red wines produced in the M\u00e9doc and the rest of the left bank of the Gironde estuary. Typical top-quality Ch\u00e2teaux blends are 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 15% Cabernet Franc and 15% Merlot. This is typically referred to as the \"Bordeaux blend\". Merlot tends to predominate in Saint-\u00c9milion, Pomerol and the other right bank appellations. These Right Bank blends from top -quality Ch\u00e2teaux are typically 70% Merlot, 15% Cabernet Franc and 15% Cabernet Sauvignon.[16]\n\n\n\n### Whites[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* *Red Libourne, or \"Right Bank\" wines*. Around the city of Libourne, 10 appellations produce wines dominated by Merlot with very little Cabernet Sauvignon, the two most famous being Saint-\u00c9milion and Pomerol. These wines often have great fruit concentration, softer tannins and are long-lived. Saint-\u00c9milion has an official classification.[20] In 2007, 10.5% of the region's vineyard surface was used for wines in this family.[17]\n* *Red Graves and M\u00e9doc or \"Left Bank\" wines*. North and south of the city of Bordeaux, which are the classic areas, produce wines dominated by Cabernet Sauvignon, but often with a significant portion of Merlot. These wines are concentrated, tannic, long-lived and most of them meant to be cellared before drinking. The five First Growths are situated here. There are official classifications for both M\u00e9doc and Graves.[21] In 2007, 17.1% of the region's vineyard surface was used for wines in this family.[17]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWine produced in the Bordeaux region of France\n\n\n\n\n\n![](image)Map of the Bordeaux regions with most of its appellations shown. The rivers Garonne and Dordogne, and the Gironde estuary are important in defining the various parts of the region\n**Bordeaux wine** (Occitan: *vin de Bord\u00e8u*, French: *vin de Bordeaux*) is produced in the Bordeaux region of southwest France, around the city of Bordeaux, on the Garonne River. To the north of the city the Dordogne River joins the Garonne forming the broad estuary called the Gironde; the Gironde department, with a total vineyard area of 110,800 hectares,[1] is the largest wine growing area in France.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn addition to mixing wine from different grape varieties, wine from different parts of the vineyard is often aged separately, and then blended into either the main or the second wine (or sold off wholesale) according to the judgment of the winemaker. The wine is then bottled and usually undergoes a further period of ageing before it is released for sale.[13]\n\n\n\n## Wine styles[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ch\u00e2teau Pichon-Longueville-Baron in Pauillac\n![](image)Ch\u00e2teau d'Yquem in Sauternes\n![](image)Ch\u00e2teau Cheval Blanc in Saint-\u00c9milion\n![](image)Ch\u00e2teau P\u00e9trus in Pomerol\nThe Bordeaux wine region is divided into subregions including Saint-\u00c9milion, Pomerol, M\u00e9doc, and Graves. The 60 Bordeaux appellations and the wine styles they represent are usually categorized into six main families, four red based on the subregions and two white based on sweetness:[17]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the late 1960s S\u00e9millon was the most planted grape in Bordeaux. Since then it has been in constant decline although it still is the most common of Bordeaux's white grapes. Sauvignon blanc's popularity on the other hand has been rising, overtaking Ugni blanc as the second most planted white Bordeaux grape in the late 1980s and now being grown in an area more than half the size of that of the lower yielding S\u00e9millon.\n\n\nWineries all over the world aspire to making wines in a Bordeaux style. In 1988, a group of American vintners formed The Meritage Association to identify wines made in this way. Although most Meritage wines come from California, there are members of the Meritage Association in 18 states and five other countries, including Argentina, Australia, Canada, Israel, and Mexico.\n\n\n\n## Viticulture and winemaking[edit]\n\n\n### Viticulture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Winemaking in Bordeaux\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* *Sweet white wines*. In several locations and appellations throughout the region, sweet white wine is made from S\u00e9millon, Sauvignon blanc and Muscadelle grapes affected by noble rot. The best-known of these appellations is Sauternes, which also has an official classification, and where some of the world's most famous sweet wines are produced. There are also appellations neighbouring Sauternes, on both sides of the Garonne river, where similar wines are made. These include Loupiac, Cadillac, and Sainte Croix du Mont. The regional appellation for sweet white wines is Bordeaux Sup\u00e9rieur Blanc.[23] In 2007, 3.2% of the region's vineyard surface was used for wines in this family.[17][18]\n\n\nThe vast majority of Bordeaux wine is red, with red wine production outnumbering white wine production six to one.[5]\n\n\n\n## Wine classification[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Bordeaux wine regions and Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** *press release* Conseil interprofessionnel du vin de bordeaux (CIVB), (french) retrieved 4.

The white grapes are S\u00e9millon (54% by area), Sauvignon blanc (36%), Muscadelle (7%) and a small amount of Ugni blanc, Colombard and Folle blanche (3% in total).[2] Because of the generally humid Bordeaux climate, a variety of pests can cause a problem for the *vigneron*. In the past, this was counteracted by the widespread use of pesticides, although the use of natural methods has recently been gaining in popularity. The vines are generally trained in either single or double guyot. Hand-picking is preferred by most of the prestigious ch\u00e2teaux, but machine-harvesting is popular in other places.[13]\n\n\n\n### Winemaking[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* *Red Bordeaux and Red Bordeaux Sup\u00e9rieur*. Bordeaux winemakers may use the two regional appellations throughout the entire wine region; however, approximately half of the Bordeaux vineyard is specifically designated under Bordeaux and Bordeaux Sup\u00e9rieur AOCs. With the majority of ch\u00e2teaux located on the Right Bank in the Entre-Deux-Mers area, wines are typically Merlot-dominant, often blended with the other classic Bordeaux varieties. There are many small, family-run ch\u00e2teaux, as well as wines blended and sold by wine merchants under commercial brand names. The Bordeaux AOC wines tend to be fruity, with minimal influence of oak, and are produced in a style meant to be drunk young. Bordeaux Superieur AOC wines are produced in the same area, but must follow stricter controls, such as lower yields, and are often aged in oak. For the past 10 years, there has been strong, ongoing investment by the winemakers in both the vineyards and in the cellar, resulting in ever increasing quality. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the seventeenth century, Dutch traders drained the swampy ground of the M\u00e9doc so it could be planted with vines, and this gradually surpassed Graves as the most prestigious region of Bordeaux. Malbec was the dominant grape here, until the early 19th century, when it was replaced by Cabernet Sauvignon.[5]\n\n\nIn 1855, the ch\u00e2teaux of Bordeaux were classified; this classification remains widely used today. From 1875 to 1892 almost all Bordeaux vineyards were ruined by phylloxera infestations.[6] The region's wine industry was rescued by grafting native vines on to pest-resistant American rootstock.[6]\n\n\n\n## Climate and geography[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)S\u00e9millon grapes in Barsac\nWhite Bordeaux is predominantly, and exclusively in the case of the sweet Sauternes, made from S\u00e9millon, Sauvignon blanc and Muscadelle. Typical blends are 80% S\u00e9millon and 20% Sauvignon blanc. As with the reds, white Bordeaux wines are usually blends, most commonly of S\u00e9millon and a smaller proportion of Sauvignon blanc. Other permitted grape varieties are Sauvignon gris, Ugni blanc, Colombard, Merlot blanc, Ondenc and Mauzac. Recently permitted by Bordeaux wineries, three new white grapes have been added. These grapes are Alvarinho, Petit Manseng, and Liliorila.[14]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Merlot is also one of the most popular red wine varietals in many markets.[2] This flexibility has helped to make it one of the world's most planted grape varieties. As of 2004, Merlot was estimated to be the third most grown variety at 260,000 hectares (640,000 acres) globally.[3]\nThe area planted to Merlot has continued to increase, with 266,000 hectares (660,000 acres) in 2015.[4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Vineyards and winery exterior of Ch\u00e2teau P\u00e9trus\nMerlot is the most commonly grown grape variety in France.[1] In 2004, total French plantations stood at 115,000 hectares (280,000 acres).[12] By 2017, that number had dropped slightly to 112,000 hectares (280,000 acres).[13] It is most prominent in Southwest France in regions like Bordeaux, Bergerac and Cahors where it is often blended with Malbec. The largest recent increase in Merlot plantations has occurred in the south of France, such as Languedoc-Roussillon, where it is often made under the designation of *Vin de Pays* wine.[10] Here, Merlot accounted for 29,914 hectares (73,920 acres), more than doubling the 11,000 hectares (27,000 acres) devoted to Cabernet Sauvignon in the Languedoc.[1]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the traditional Bordeaux blend, Merlot's role is to add body and softness. Despite accounting for 50-60% of overall plantings in Bordeaux, the grape tends to account for an average of 25% of the blends\u2014especially in the Bordeaux wine regions of Graves and M\u00e9doc. Of these Left Bank regions, the commune of St-Estephe uses the highest percentage of Merlot in the blends.[8] However, Merlot is much more prominent on the Right Bank of the Gironde in the regions of Pomerol and Saint-\u00c9milion, where it will commonly comprise the majority of the blend. One of the most famous and rare wines in the world, Ch\u00e2teau P\u00e9trus, is almost all Merlot. In Pomerol, where Merlot usually accounts for around 80% of the blend, the iron-clay soils of the region give Merlot more of a tannic backbone than what is found in other Bordeaux regions. It was in Pomerol that the *garagistes* movement began with small-scale production of highly sought after Merlot-based wines. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n9. **^** J-M. Boursiquot; T. Lacombe; V.

Merlot vines can also be found growing in the Barossa Valley, McLaren Vale and Wrattonbully in South Australia.[6] In 2008, it was the third most widely planted red grape variety after Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon with 10,537 hectares (26,040 acres). As in California, the global \"Merlot craze\" spurred an increase of plantings, most of it in the warm, irrigated regions of Murray Darling, Riverina and Riverland where the grape variety could be mass-produced. Recent plantings, such as those in the Margaret River area of Western Australia have been focusing on making more Bordeaux-style blends.[1]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMerlot is one of the world's most widely planted grape variety with plantings of the vine outpacing even the more well-known Cabernet Sauvignon in many regions, including the grape's homeland of France.[1] Here, France is home to nearly two thirds of the world's total plantings of Merlot.[10] Beyond France it is also grown in Italy (where it is the country's 5th most planted grape), Algeria,[11] California, Romania, Australia, Argentina, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, Greece, New Zealand, South Africa, Switzerland, Croatia, Hungary, Montenegro, Slovenia, Mexico and other parts of the United States such as Washington, Virginia and Long Island. It grows in many regions that also grow Cabernet Sauvignon but tends to be cultivated in the cooler portions of those areas. In areas that are too warm, Merlot will ripen too early.[6]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBy the 19th century it was being regularly planted in the M\u00e9doc on the \"Left Bank\" of the Gironde.[6] After a series of setbacks that includes a severe frost in 1956 and several vintages in the 1960s lost to rot, French authorities in Bordeaux banned new plantings of Merlot vines between 1970 and 1975.[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn places like Israel, Merlot is the second most widely planted grape variety after Cabernet Sauvignon with 1,000 hectares (2,500 acres) in cultivation, making very \"New World-style\" wines. The grape can also be found in Turkey with 429 hectares (1,060 acres) in 2010 as well as Malta and Cyprus.[1]\n\n\n\n### France[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the sandy, clay-limestone-based soils of Saint-\u00c9milion, Merlot accounts for around 60% of the blend and is usually blended with Cabernet Franc. In limestone, Merlot tends to develop more perfume notes while in sandy soils the wines are generally softer than Merlot grown in clay dominant soils.[6] Merlot can also be found in significant quantities in Provence, Loire Valley, Savoie, Ard\u00e8che, Charente, Corr\u00e8ze, Dr\u00f4me, Is\u00e8re and Vienne.[6]\n\n\n\n![](image)Berries of Merlot being sorted at Chateau Kirwan in a process that removes shot berries and MOG.\n### Italy[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2008, there were 13,325 hectares (32,930 acres) of Merlot, a significant increase from the 8,700 hectares (21,000 acres) that were being cultivated in the country only 4 years earlier.[1] In 2015, this had dropped slightly to 13,044 hectares (32,230 acres), making Merlot the eighth most planted red grape variety in Spain. The largest concentration of the grape is in the Mediterranean climate of Catalonia and the continental climate of Castilla\u2013La Mancha, with significant plantings also in Navarra and Aragon. In Costers del Segre, the grape is often used in Bordeaux-style blends while in Aragon, Navarra, and Castilla-La Mancha it is sometimes blended with Tempranillo and other local Spanish wine grape varieties.\n\n\n\n### Central Europe[edit]\n\n\nIn Germany, there were 450 hectares (1,100 acres) of Merlot growing in 2008 with the grape mostly planted in the warmer German wine regions of the Palatinate and Rheinhessen.[1]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMerlot is grown across the United States\u2014as of 2015, it is the fourth most planted wine grape[13]\u2014with California and Washington growing the most. Other regions producing significant quantities of Merlot include New York State with 365 hectares (900 acres) in 2006 with most of it in the maritime climate of the Long Island AVA and multiple regions in Ohio. In Texas, Merlot is the second most widely planted red wine grape after Cabernet Sauvignon with 117 hectares (290 acres). In Virginia, the grape was the most widely planted red variety with 136 hectares (340 acres) in 2010, most of it in the Monticello AVA and Shenandoah Valley AVA, while Oregon had 206 hectares (510 acres) in 2008 with most planted in the Rogue Valley AVA.[1][8]\n\n\n\n#### California[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

In the Right bank regions of Saint-\u00c9milion and Pomerol, Cabernet is a distant third in plantings behind Merlot & Cabernet franc.[3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Bordeaux wine region accounts for more than 60% of the Cabernet Sauvignon grown in France. Outside of Bordeaux, Cabernet Sauvignon is found in varying quantities throughout Le Midi and in the Loire Valley. Cabernet Sauvignon wines are generally lighter and less structured, drinkable much earlier than Bordeaux wine. In the southwest French *appellation d'origine contr\u00f4l\u00e9e* (AOCs) of Bergerac and Buzet it is used to make ros\u00e9 wine. In some regions, it is used to add flavour and structure to Carignan while it is blended with N\u00e9grette in Gaillac and Fronton as well as Tannat in Madiran. In Provence, the grape had some presence in the region in the mid-19th century, when viticulturist Jules Guyot recommended it as a blending partner with Syrah. In recent years, several Midi wine estates, such as Mas de Daumas Gassac have received international acclaim for their Cabernet Sauvignon blended in H\u00e9rault, with Rh\u00f4ne grapes like Syrah. It is often made as a single varietal in the *vin de pays* of the Languedoc. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Cabernet grape variety has thrived in a variety of vineyard soil types, making the consideration of soil less of a concern, particularly for New World winemakers. In Bordeaux, the soil aspect of *terroir* was historically an important consideration in determining which of the major Bordeaux grape varieties were planted. While Merlot seemed to thrive in clay- and limestone-based soils (such as those of the Right Bank regions of the Gironde estuary), Cabernet Sauvignon seemed to perform better in the gravel-based soil of the M\u00e9doc region on the Left Bank. The gravel soils offered the benefit of being well drained while absorbing and radiating heat to the vines, aiding ripening. Clay- and limestone-based soils are often cooler, allowing less heat to reach the vines, and delaying ripening. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the wine regions of the Left Bank, the Cabernet influence of the wine has shown unique characteristics in the different regions. In Saint-Est\u00e8phe and Pessac-L\u00e9ognan, the grape develops more mineral flavours. Aromas of violets are a characteristic of Margaux. Pauillac is noted by a strong lead pencil scent and Saint-Julien by cedar and cigar boxes. The Cabernet wines of the Moulis are characterized by their soft tannins and rich fruit flavours while the southern Graves region is characterized by strong blackcurrant flavours, though in less intense wines overall.[3] The percentage of Cabernet Sauvignon used in the blend will depend on *terroir* and the winemakers' styles as well as the vintage. The First Growth estates of Ch\u00e2teau Mouton Rothschild and Ch\u00e2teau Latour are noted for regularly producing wines with some of the highest percentages of Cabernet\u2014 often around 75%.[1]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHowever, by 2015, Cabernet Sauvignon had once again become the most widely planted wine grape, with a total of 341,000 hectares (3,410\u00a0km2) under vine worldwide.[2]\n\n\nDespite its prominence in the industry, the grape is a relatively new variety, the product of a chance crossing between Cabernet Franc and Sauvignon blanc during the 17th century in southwestern France. Its popularity is often attributed to its ease of cultivation\u2014the grapes have thick skins and the vines are hardy and naturally low yielding, budding late to avoid frost and resistant to viticultural hazards such as rot and insects\u2014and to its consistent presentation of structure and flavours which express the typical character (\"typicity\") of the variety. Familiarity has helped sell Cabernet Sauvignon wines to consumers, even from unfamiliar wine regions. Its widespread popularity has also contributed to criticism of the grape as a \"colonizer\" that takes over wine regions at the expense of indigenous grape varieties.[3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDNA evidence has shown Cabernet Sauvignon is the result of crossing two other Bordeaux grape varieties\u2014 Cabernet franc and Sauvignon blanc\u2014 which has led grapevine historians, or *ampelographers*, to believe that the grape originated in Bordeaux. Early records indicate that the grape was widespread in the M\u00e9doc region during the 18th century. The loose berry clusters and thick skins of the grape provided an excellent resistance to rot in the sometimes wet maritime climate of Bordeaux. The grape continued to grow in popularity until the *Powdery mildew* epidemic of 1852 exposed Cabernet Sauvignon's sensitivity to that grape disease. With vineyards severely ravaged or lost, many Bordeaux wine growers turned to Merlot, increasing its plantings to where it soon became the most widely planted grape in Bordeaux. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Armand d'Armailhac of Ch\u00e2teau d'Armailhac *(bottle picture)* and Baron Hector de Brane of Ch\u00e2teau Mouton were important figures in the establishment of Cabernet Sauvignon in Bordeaux.\nThe Bordeaux wine region is intimately connected with Cabernet Sauvignon, even though wine is rarely made without the blended component of other grape varieties. It is the likely place of origin of the vine, and producers across the globe have invested heavily in trying to reproduce the structure and complexity of Bordeaux wines. While the \"Bordeaux blend\" of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot created the earliest examples of acclaimed Cabernet Sauvignon wine, Cabernet Sauvignon was first blended in Bordeaux with Syrah (from the Northern Rhone), a pairing that is widely seen in Australia and some *vin de pays* wines from the Languedoc.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Cabernet Sauvignon** (French: [kab\u025b\u0281n\u025b sovi\u0272\u0254\u0303]) is one of the world's most widely recognized red wine grape varieties. It is grown in nearly every major wine producing country among a diverse spectrum of climates from Australia and  British Columbia, Canada to Lebanon's Beqaa Valley. Cabernet Sauvignon became internationally recognized through its prominence in Bordeaux wines, where it is often blended with Merlot and Cabernet Franc. From France and Spain, the grape spread across Europe and to the New World where it found new homes in places like California's Napa Valley, New Zealand's Hawke's Bay, South Africa's Stellenbosch region, Australia's Margaret River, McLaren Vale and Coonawarra regions, and Chile's Maipo Valley and Colchagua. For most of the 20th century, it was the world's most widely planted premium red wine grape until it was surpassed by Merlot in the 1990s.[1]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe decision to first start blending Cabernet Sauvignon was partly derived from financial necessity. The sometimes temperamental and unpredictable climate of Bordeaux during the \"Little Ice Age\" did not guarantee a successful harvest every year; producers had to insure themselves against the risk of losing an entire vintage by planting a variety of grapes. Over time it was discovered that the unique characteristics of each grape variety could complement each other and enhance the quality of the wine. Cabernet Sauvignon added structure, acidity, tannins and aging potential as a base or backbone of the wine. By itself, particularly when harvested at less than ideal ripeness, it can lack a sense of fruit or \"fleshiness\" on the palate which can be compensated by adding the rounder flavours of Merlot. Cabernet franc can add more aromas to the bouquet and more fruitiness. In the lighter soils of the Margaux region, Cabernet-based wines can lack colour, which can be achieved by blending in Petit Verdot. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA common factor affecting Bordeaux wines' flavours is Cabernet Sauvignon's harvest yields. Throughout Bordeaux, there is a legal maximum permitted yield of 50 hectoliters (hl) per hectare (ha). With the aid of global warming and vigorous rootstocks, many Bordeaux vineyards can easily surpass 60 hl/ha, with some estates taking advantage of the legal loophole of *plafond limite de classement* (\"ceiling limit classification\") that permits higher yields during \"exceptional\" years. This has had an adverse effect on the quality of production from some producers who regularly use grapes harvested at excessive yields. In recent years there has been more of an emphasis on keeping yields low, particularly for an estate's *Grand vin*.[3]\n\n\n\n#### Other French regions[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWhile the period when the name *Cabernet Sauvignon* became more prevalent over *Petite Vidure* is not certain, records indicate that the grape was a popular Bordeaux planting in the 18th century M\u00e9doc region. The first estates known to have actively grown the variety (and the likely source of Cabernet vines for other estates) were Ch\u00e2teau Mouton and Ch\u00e2teau d'Armailhac in Pauillac.[3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

As of 2000, it was the sixth most widely planted red grape variety in the country. Other areas with significant plantings include the Bergerac and Madiran *Appellation d'origine contr\u00f4l\u00e9e* (AOCs). By the early 20th century, there were nearly equal plantings of Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc in Bordeaux with around 25,000 acres (10,000\u00a0ha) by the late 1960s. Most of these plantings were along the right bank of the Gironde in the Fronsac, St-Emilion and Pomerol regions. Towards the end of the 20th century, even though plantings of Cabernet Sauvignon had rapidly increased in Bordeaux to a 2 to 1 ratio in proportion to Cabernet Franc, plantings there were over 35,360 acres (14,310\u00a0ha) of the latter, nearly half of the country's total 88,900 acres (36,000\u00a0ha).[4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCabernet Franc can adapt to a wide variety of vineyard soil types but seems to thrive in sandy, chalk soils, producing heavier, more full bodied wines there. In the Loire Valley, *terroir* based differences can be perceived between wines made from grapes grown in gravel terraces versus tuffeau slopes. The grape is highly yield sensitive, with over-cropping producing wines with more green, vegetal notes.[5]\n\n\n\n## Wine regions[edit]\n\n\nAcross the world Cabernet Franc is one of the twenty most widely planted grape varieties. Plantings are found throughout Europe, in the New World, China and Kazakhstan. In many regions, it is planted as a component of a Bordeaux-style blend such as Meritage, playing secondary role to Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. In parts of northeast Italy, Anjou-Saumur, Touraine and the right bank region of Bordeaux, Cabernet Franc both plays a more prominent role in blends and is vinted as a varietal.[4]\n\n\n\n### France[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Cabernet Franc grapes\nCabernet Franc is believed to have been established in the Libournais region of southwest France sometime in the 17th century, when Cardinal Richelieu transported cuttings of the vine to the Loire Valley. They were planted at the Abbey of Bourgueil under the care of an abbot named Breton, whose name became associated with the grape. By the 18th century, plantings of Cabernet Franc (known as **Bouchet**) were found throughout Fronsac, Pomerol and St-Emilion, making quality wines. As Cabernet Sauvignon grew more popular in the 18th and 19th centuries, the close similarity of the two grapes was observed and theories emerged as to the extent of their relationship. In 1997, DNA evidence emerged to show that Cabernet Franc had crossed with Sauvignon Blanc to produce Cabernet Sauvignon.[4]\n\n\n\n## Viticulture[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nVariety of black grape\n\n\"Petit Fer\" redirects here.

It is principally grown for blending with Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot in the Bordeaux style, but can also be vinified alone, as in the Loire's Chinon. In addition to being used in blends and produced as a varietal in Canada and the United States, it is sometimes made into ice wine in those regions.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCabernet Franc is lighter than Cabernet Sauvignon,[1] making a bright pale red wine[2] that contributes finesse and lends a peppery perfume to blends with more robust grapes. Depending on the growing region and style of wine, additional aromas can include tobacco, raspberry, bell pepper, cassis, and violets.\n\n\nRecords of Cabernet Franc in Bordeaux go back to the end of the 18th century, although it was planted in Loire long before that time. DNA analysis indicates that Cabernet Franc is one of two parents of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Carm\u00e9n\u00e8re.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Varieties commonly mistaken for Cabernet franc:** Ardonnet (B\u00e9arn, no longer cultivated), Arrouya (Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es), B\u00e9quignol noir (Dissay in the Vienne), Cabernet sauvignon, Carmen\u00e8re, Gros Cabernet (M\u00e9doc, no longer cultivated), Hondarribi Beltza (Pa\u00eds Vasco in Spain).[11]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMore recently the grape has caught the attention of growers in cooler areas such as Long Island and the Finger Lakes of New York, the Grand Valley AVA of Colorado, the Shawnee Hills AVA of southern Illinois, Pennsylvania, all sub-regions in Ohio, Michigan's west coast, Washington state and in the Monticello wine region in the Virginia Piedmont as well as the Roanoke metropolitan area, increasing planting in Missouri and Rocky Knob AVA areas of Southwestern Virginia. Michigan State University conducts research on Cabernet Franc at their agricultural research center in Benton Harbor, Michigan. In the Great Lakes Region and Virginia, Cabernet Franc is valued for its ability to ripen more reliably than other red *Vitis vinifera* and to produce wines of better quality than most hybrid grapes.[4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the New World, Cabernet is used predominantly as a blending component and is found in scant amounts in Australia, South Africa, Chile and New Zealand.[4] As with so many grapes, Cabernet Franc came to Australia in James Busby's collection of 1832. It predominantly grows in cool, cool to warm and warm climates such as North-Eastern Victoria, McLaren Vale, the Adelaide Hills and the Clare Valley.[6] In New Zealand, many winemakers have found that the cool climate of their *terroir* contributes to Cabernet Franc-like flavors in their Cabernet Sauvignon and plantings of true Cabernet Franc have remained limited with only around 519 acres (210\u00a0ha) planted as of 2006. In South Africa, Cabernet Franc has become a favorite of some of the country's *boutique* wineries and acreage has slowly been increasing to nearly 2,470 acres (1,000\u00a0ha) by the mid-2000s. In Chile there were around 2,910 acres (1,180\u00a0ha) planted by the early 21st century.[10]\n\n\n\n## Wines[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the Loire Valley, Cabernet is widely planted in the Anjou, Bourgueil, Chinon, and Saumur-Champigny regions.[4]\n\n\n\n### Italy[edit]\n\n\nBy 2000 there were over 17,300 acres (7,000\u00a0ha) of Cabernet Franc in Italy. However, the grape variety is commonly confused with both Cabernet Sauvignon and the ancient Bordeaux grape Carmenere, so the true acreage may not be known until more vineyards have been surveyed by ampelographers.[4] It is mostly planted in the far northeast of Italy, particularly in Friuli, but it is also found in the vineyards of the Veneto (where it is known as **Bordo**), and is found as part of some Chianti blends, even as far south as Apulia.[6] Plantings of Cabernet Franc in Tuscany have been increasing in recent years, particularly in the Bolgheri and Maremma region where the grape is prized for the balance and elegance that it brings to blends. Italian wines often labelled simply as \"Cabernet\" tend to be primarily Cabernet Franc or a blend of Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon.[4]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Discovery Channel: \"DNA analysis reveals mysterious past of Cabernet Sauvignon\"\".
