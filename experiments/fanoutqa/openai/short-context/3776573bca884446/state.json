As of the 2020 census it had a population of 2,514. It is the newest of the nine suburban North Shore communities bordering Lake Michigan, and is one of those developed as a planned community. In 2018, Kenilworth was the eighth wealthiest community in the United States, and the wealthiest in the Midwestern United States.[2]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nKenilworth was founded in 1889 when Joseph Sears purchased 223.6 acres of land consisting of several farms between the Chicago and North Western Railroad and Lake Michigan for $150,300. Sears and several of his associates formed The Kenilworth Company to execute his suburban dream.[3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nChicago metropolitan area\n |\n| --- |\n| Major city | * **Chicago**\n | ![Chicago landsat image](image)\n |\n| Cities(over 30,000 in 2010) | * Aurora\n* Berwyn\n* Calumet City\n* Chicago Heights\n* Crystal Lake\n* DeKalb\n* Des Plaines\n* Elgin\n* Elmhurst\n* Evanston\n* Gary\n* Hammond\n* Joliet\n* Kenosha\n* Naperville\n* North Chicago\n* Park Ridge\n* Portage\n* St. Charles\n* Valparaiso\n* Waukegan\n* Wheaton\n |\n| Towns and villages(over 30,000 in 2010) | * Addison\n* Algonquin\n* Arlington Heights\n* Bartlett\n* Bolingbrook\n* Buffalo Grove\n* Carol Stream\n* Carpentersville\n* Cicero\n* Downers Grove\n* Elk Grove Village\n* Glendale Heights\n* Glenview\n* Gurnee\n* Hanover Park\n* Hoffman Estates\n* Lombard\n* Merrillville\n* Mount Prospect\n* Mundelein\n* Northbrook\n* Oak Lawn\n* Oak Park\n* Orland Park\n* Oswego\n* Palatine\n* Plainfield\n* Romeoville\n* Schaumburg\n* Skokie\n* Streamwood\n* Tinley Park\n* Wheeling\n* Woodridge\n |\n| Counties | * Cook\n* DeKalb\n* DuPage\n* Grundy\n* Jasper\n* Kane\n* Kankakee\n* Kendall\n* Kenosha\n* Lake, IL\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

This information is not readily available in a single source like Wikipedia. \n\nHowever, I can guide you on how to find this information:\n\n1. **US Census Bureau**: The American Community Survey (ACS) conducted by the US Census Bureau provides detailed income data by zip code. You can access this data through their website or data tools like Data.census.gov.\n\n2. **IRS Statistics**: The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) publishes income data by zip code, which can be found on their website.\n\n3. **Commercial Data Providers**: Companies like Esri, Nielsen, and others provide detailed demographic and income data, often for a fee.\n\nWould you like more detailed instructions on how to access these resources, or is there something else specific you need help with?",
