He then starred as Dr. Jedediah Foster on the PBS American Civil War drama series *Mercy Street*, Lou Mazzuchelli in the musical series *Rise*, and as Lonny Flash in *Hunters*.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nRadnor was born in Columbus, Ohio to a Jewish family, the son of Carol Radnor (née Hirsch), a high school guidance counselor, and Alan Radnor, a medical malpractice lawyer.[2] Radnor has two sisters, Melanie Radnor Silverman and Joanna Radnor Vilensky.[3]\n\n\nHe grew up in Bexley, Ohio, a suburb of Columbus, and was raised in Conservative Judaism.[4] He attended the Orthodox Jewish day school Columbus Torah Academy before going to Bexley High School[5][6][7] and then Kenyon College, where his school's theater department presented him with the Paul Newman Award and during which he spent a semester (Spring 1995) training at the National Theater Institute at the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center in Waterford, Connecticut.

In 2004, Radnor starred in *The Paris Letter* alongside his future *How I Met Your Mother* co-star Neil Patrick Harris.[11] From 2005 to 2014, Radnor starred in *How I Met Your Mother*, his biggest role to date.\n\n\nIn July 2008, he starred opposite Jennifer Westfeldt in the premiere of the play *Finks*,[12] written by Joe Gilford and directed by Charlie Stratton for New York Stage and Film. Radnor made his directorial debut with the film *Happythankyoumoreplease*, where he was both the writer and star of the 2010 comedy-drama.[13]\nHis second directorial effort, *Liberal Arts*, starring himself and Elizabeth Olsen, premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 22, 2012.[14] Radnor appeared in the Broadway production of *Disgraced*, which opened October 23, 2014, at the Lyceum Theatre.[15][16] He is set to direct the sci-fi thriller film *The Leaves*.[17] Radnor is currently starring in the Amazon Prime series, *Hunters*, as Lonny Flash, and on Netflix's *Centaurworld*, as Durpleton.\n\n\nIn October 2016, Radnor also confirmed he is in a band, Radnor and Lee, with Australian musician Ben Lee. Radnor and Lee had known each other for \"twelve or thirteen years after meeting on the set of *How I Met Your Mother*\" eventually writing songs together.[18] Their debut album, *Radnor & Lee* was released on November 10, 2017,[19] \"receiving widespread praise across the board, and cementing the duo as an accomplished pair of artists,\" stated Rolling Stone.[20] On February 19, 2020, Spin announced Radnor and Lee's sophomore album, *Golden State*, out on Flower Moon Records, and premiered the first single \"Outside In.\"[21] American Songwriter later premiered the video for the album's 2nd single, \"Simple Harmony.\" Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the album's release date was pushed back to June 2020.[22]\n\n\nRadnor's debut solo EP, *One More Then I'll Let You Go,* was released on April 16, 2021, on Flower Moon Records. Rolling Stone premiered the first single, \"The High Road,\" March 10, 2021, calling it a \"gently lilting ballad about the breakdown of a friendship on which he sings... which features deep textures of piano, acoustic guitar, organ, and snapping fingers.\"[23] The EP's 2nd single, \"You Feel New,\" premiered on March 31, 2021, with features in Rolling Stone, NPR, American Songwriter and Paste Magazine.[24]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nIn 2008, Radnor told the *Los Angeles Times*, \"I do Transcendental Meditation, and part of the reason I chose my house is that I thought it would be a great place to meditate.\"[25]\n\n\nRadnor is an avid Cloud Cult fan. He collaborated with the band to make the film *The Seeker* in 2016. Radnor explained, \"What's true for me about a lot of music, but especially true for Cloud Cult's music, is that it stirs up the thing that's already in you and calls it out.
