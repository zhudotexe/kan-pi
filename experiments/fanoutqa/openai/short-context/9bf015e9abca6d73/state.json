Some market commentators doubted the economy's ability to cope with the effects of the crisis. In the end the economy grew in 2009 by 3.1% and in 2010, the nation saw a 15.2% growth rate.[72][73]\n\n\nAs of 8 June 2013, Singapore's unemployment rate is around 1.9% and the country's economy has a lowered growth rate, with a rate of 1.8% on a quarter-by-quarter basis\u2014compared to 14.8% in 2010.\n\n\n2015 and 2016 saw a downturn for the nation as GDP growth shrunk to just 2 percent. Despite growth diminishing, the nation has yet to post negative growth rates which are a positive sign. During the same period of diminishing economic growth. Unemployment and inflation have also decreased.[72]\n\n\nAs of 2017 Singapore's GDP reached $323.907 billion.[74]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nEconomy of Singapore| ![](image)Skyline of Singapore's Downtown Core\n |\n| Currency | Singapore dollar (SGD/S$) |\n| Fiscal year\n | 1 April\u00a0\u2013 31 March |\n| Trade organisations\n | WTO, APEC, CPTPP, IOR-ARC, RCEP, ASEAN and others |\n| Country group\n | * Developed/advanced[1]\n* High-income economy[2]\n |\n| Statistics |\n| Population | ![Increase](image) 5,917,600 (Jun 2023)[3] |\n| GDP | * ![Increase](image) $515 billion (nominal; 2023 est.)[4]\n* ![Increase](image) $757 billion (PPP; 2023 est.)[4]\n |\n| GDP rank | * 30th (nominal; 2023)\n* 38th (PPP; 2023)\n |\n| GDP growth\n | * ![Increase](image) 7.6%\u00a0(2021)[5]\n* ![Increase](image) 3.0%\u00a0(2022f)[5]\n* ![Increase](image) 2.3%\u00a0(2023f)[5]\n |\n| GDP per capita\n | * ![Increase](image) $91,100 (nominal; 2023 est.)[4]\n* ![Increase](image) $133,894 (PPP; 2023 est.)[4]\n |\n| GDP per capita rank\n | * 2nd (nominal; 2022)\n* 5th (PPP; 2023)\n |\n| GDP by sector\n | * agriculture: 0.5%\n* industry: 24.8%\n* services: 75.2%\n* (2017 est.)[6]\n |\n| Inflation (CPI)\n | 5.5% (Jan 2023)[7] |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSingapore's economic strategy produced real growth averaging 8.0% from 1960 to 1999. Since the nations independence in 1965 Singapore GDP has amassed an average of a 9.5% increase.[72] The economy picked up in 1999 under Goh Chok Tong, the Prime Minister of Singapore, after the regional financial crisis, with a growth rate of 5.4%, followed by 9.9% for 2000. However, the economic slowdown in the United States, Japan and the European Union, as well as the worldwide electronics slump, had reduced the estimated economic growth in 2001 to a negative 2.0%.\n\n\nThe economy expanded by 2.2% the following year, and by 1.1% in 2003 when Singapore was affected by the SARS outbreak. Subsequently, a major turnaround occurred in 2004 allowed it to make a significant recovery of 8.3% growth in Singapore, although the actual growth fell short of the target growth for the year more than half with only 2.5%. In 2005, economic growth was 6.4%; and in 2006, 7.9%.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSingapore is one of the world's wealthiest countries *per capita*, but its Gini coefficient is high in comparison to developed countries. Statistics on income inequality are published by the Singapore Department of Statistics.[118] Without taking taxes and social transfers into account, Singapore's gini coefficient puts the country in the medium range. Nevertherless, the country remains on the \"very high\" category on the inequality-adjusted human development index (IHDI), a ranking similar to the Human Development Index (HDI), but with inequality also accounted for.[9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSingapore is expected to experience an economic slowdown in 2019, with GDP growth slowing to 1.9% from 3.1% in 2018, due to tariff hikes from the United States and China.[75]\n\n\nDuring the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic, on 26 March 2020, Singapore's Ministry of Trade and Industry said it believed that the economy would contract by between 1% and 4% in 2020. This was after the economy shrank 2.2% in the first quarter of 2020 from the same quarter in 2019.[76] On 26 May, MTI said that it was revising down its expectation for the Singapore economy in 2020 to shrink by 4% to 7%.[77] Economists had to downgrade their numbers from previously, and some suggested that the economic recovery could take some time.[78][79] In response to the economic pressure, Moody's temporarily downgraded the Singapore banking sector that year from \"stable\" outlook to a \"negative\" outlook.[80]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nGDP growth during this time was slightly lower than the preceding years, at 8.5% annually. However, unemployment was virtually 0%, and most of the population had experienced great strides in productivity.[66] The government highlighted a focus in technology and education to be the new wave of economic gain.[67] In addition, they identified financial services as a key area in which Singapore could diversify and attract new growth. During this time, the government invested heavily in its budding financial services industry. It managed to minimize inflation and provide workers with the proper equipment and machinery to sustain growth.\n\n\n\n### Recent history[edit]\n\n\n#### Growth in the service sector[edit]\n\n\nAs a result of this investment drive, Singapore's capital stock increased 33 times by 1992, and achieved a tenfold increase in the capital-labour ratio.[68] Living standards steadily rose, with more families moving from a lower-income status to middle-income security with increased household incomes.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n70. **^** Wu, Friedrich (October 1991). \"The ASEAN Economies in the 1990s and Singapore's Regional Role\". *California Management Review*. **34** (1): 103\u2013114. doi:10.2307/41166686.

This effort spurred economic productivity and put in place the foundations needed to build up basic industry. As of 2019, Singapore's infrastructure is ranked the best in terms of quality, with a score of 95.4 out of 100.[65] The period from 1973-1979 marked a struggle for Singapore as they pivoted away from basic infrastructure spending and moved towards more sustainable economic progress. The 1973 oil crisis raised government awareness of issues such as economic concentration. It forced the government to hold new forum to discuss ways of adapting the countries economy to economic change. \n</fragment>\n</document>",

Such fluctuations change a country's ranking from one year to the next, even though they often make little or no difference to the standard of living of its population.\n\n\nGDP per capita is often considered an indicator of a country's standard of living;[1][2] however, this is inaccurate because GDP per capita is not a measure of personal income.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nComparisons of national income are also frequently made on the basis of purchasing power parity (PPP), to adjust for differences in the cost of living in different countries. (*see* List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita). PPP largely removes the exchange rate problem but not others; it does not reflect the value of economic output in international trade, and it also requires more estimation than GDP per capita.

But rising global oil demand helped current GDP per capita to expand 94% in the 90s. Despite efforts to promote the non-hydrocarbon sectors and diversify the economy from hydrocarbons to knowledge-based sectors, the oil and gas sector has consistently contributed to at least 80 percent of the government of Qatar\u2019s total revenues since 2014, as well as 90 percent of Qatar\u2019s total exports.[37]\n\n\nIn 2020 GDP PPP ~260 billion dollars.[38]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAccording to the International Monetary Fund, Qatar's economic performance improved in 2018 despite the economic embargo.

The exploration of oil and gas fields began in 1939.[16][17] In 1973, oil production and revenues increased dramatically, moving Qatar out of the ranks of the world's poorest countries and providing it with one of the highest per capita incomes in the world.\n\n\nQatar's economy was in a downturn from 1982 to 1989. OPEC (Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries) quotas on crude oil production, the lower price for oil, and the generally unpromising outlook on international markets reduced oil earnings. In turn, the Qatari government's spending plans had to be cut to match lower income. The resulting recessionary local business climate caused many firms to lay off expatriate staff. With the economy recovering in the 1990s, expatriate populations, particularly from Egypt and South Asia, have grown again.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe International Monetary Fund in its spring assessment 2019 said that Qatar has \"successfully absorbed the shocks\" of the blockade imposed in 2017 and the dropped oil prices from 2014 to 2016. S&P Global had marked Qatar's outlook to negative in 2017, but changed it to stable in 2019.[27]\n\n\nIn August 2019, Qatar Central Bank stated that the country's economic growth will see a boost over the next two years amid expectations of stable oil prices and continued strong exports. The GDP is expected to grow at an average rate of 2.8% between 2018 and 2020, with the budget surplus falling to 4.35 billion riyals in 2019, from a surplus of 15.1 billion riyals in 2018.[28]\n\n\n\n### Islamic finance[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

Inflation below 5% is in green.[39]\n\n\n\nFurther information: National Consumer Price Index (Switzerland)\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter enjoying unemployment rates lower than 1% before 1990, the three-year recession also caused the unemployment rate to rise to its all-time peak of 5.3% in 1997. In 2008, Switzerland was in second place among European countries with populations above one million in terms of nominal and purchasing power parity GDP per capita, behind Norway (see list). Several times in the 1990s, real wages decreased since nominal wages could not keep up with inflation. However, beginning in 1997, a global resurgence in currency movement provided the necessary stimulus to the Swiss economy. It slowly gained momentum, and peaked in the year 2000 with 3.7% growth in real terms.[31]\n\n\n\n### 21st century[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 2013 the mean household income in Switzerland was CHF 120,624 (c. USD 134,000 nominal, US$101,000 PPP), the mean household income after social security, taxes and mandatory health insurance was CHF 85,560 (c. USD 95,000 nominal, US$72,000 PPP).[89]\nThe OECD lists Swiss household gross adjusted disposable income per capita US$32,594 PPP for 2011.[90]\n\n\nAs of 2016, Switzerland had the highest average wealth per adult, at $561,900.[91] The top 1% richest persons own 35% of all the wealth (2015).[92]\n\n\nThe \"net wealth\" of Switzerland was $5.4 trillion as measured by the net worth of its richest citizens. Among this group are 740 super-rich people with assets of at least $100 million. Switzerland has 580,000 millionaires in total which is 60,000 more than Germany with a population which is approximately 10 times larger.[93]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nEconomy of Switzerland| ![](image)The city of Zurich, the most important economic center of the country\n |\n| Currency | Swiss franc (CHF) |\n| Fiscal year\n | Calendar year |\n| Trade organisations\n | EFTA, WTO and OECD |\n| Country group\n | * Developed/Advanced[1]\n* High-income economy[2]\n* European (non-EU) economy; renowned banking and financial hub[3]\n |\n| Statistics |\n| Population | 8,636,986 (2020)[4] |\n| GDP | * $870 billion (nominal, 2023)[5]\n* $774 billion (PPP, 2023)[5]\n |\n| GDP rank | * 20th (nominal, 2023)\n* 36th (PPP, 2023)\n |\n| GDP growth\n | * 2.1%\u00a0(2022)\n* 0.8%\u00a0(2023)\n* 1.8%\u00a0(2024)[5]\n |\n| GDP per capita\n | * $98,800 (nominal, 2023)[5]\n* $88,000 (PPP, 2023)[5]\n |\n| GDP per capita rank\n | * 6th (nominal, 2023)\n* 6th (PPP, 2023)\n |\n| GDP by sector\n | * agriculture: 0.7%\n* industry: 25.6%\n* services: 73.7%\n* (2017)[3]\n |\n| Inflation (CPI)\n | 2.4% (2023)[5] |\n| Population below poverty line\n | * 6.6% in poverty (2014)[3]\n* 17.4% at risk of poverty or social exclusion (AROPE, 2018)[6]\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe stock market collapse of 2007-2009 deeply affected investment income earned abroad. This translated to a substantial fall in the surplus of the current account balance. In 2006, Switzerland recorded a 15.1% per GDP surplus. It went down to 9.1% in 2007 and further dropped to 1.8% in 2008. It recovered in 2009 and 2010 with a surplus of 11.9% and 14.6% respectively.[37] Unemployment peaked in December 2009 at 4.4%.

By the end of the decade oil provided over three-quarters of Switzerland's energy.[29]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn 27 September 2020 voters in the Canton of Geneva approved a minimum wage of 23 Swiss franc per hour or about 4,000 per month.[86]\n\n\nWith the peak of the number of bankruptcies in 2003, however, the mood was pessimistic. Massive layoffs and dismissals by enterprises resulting from the global economic slowdown, major management scandals and different foreign investment attitudes have strained the traditional Swiss labour peace. Swiss trade unions have encouraged strikes against several companies, including Swiss International Air Lines, Coca-Cola, and Orange. Total days lost to strikes, however, remain among the lowest in the OECD.\n\n\nA study estimated that Switzerland will have a short fall of hundreds of thousands of workers by 2030.[87] According to statistics, one in four Swiss has a second job.[88]\n\n\n\n## Income and wealth distribution[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Demographics of Switzerland and Poverty in Switzerland\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the 1970s the GDP growth rate gradually declined from a peak of 6.5% in 1970; GDP then contracted by 7.5% in 1975 and 1976. Switzerland became increasingly dependent on oil imported from its main suppliers, the OPEC cartel. The 1973 international oil crisis caused Switzerland's energy consumption to decrease in the years from 1973 to 1978.[29] In 1974 there were three nationwide car-free Sundays when private transport was prohibited as a result of the oil supply shock. From 1977 onwards GDP grew again, although Switzerland was also affected by the 1979 energy crisis which resulted in a short-term decrease in Switzerland's energy consumption. In 1970 industry still employed about 46% of the labor force, but during the economic recession of the 1970s the services sector grew to dominate the national economy. By 1970 17.2% of the population and about one quarter of the work force were foreign nationals, though job losses during the economic recession decreased this number.[28]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the 1980s, Switzerland's economy contracted by 1.3% in 1982 but grew substantially for the rest of the decade, with annual GDP growth between about 3% and 4%, apart from 1986 and 1987 when growth decreased to 1.9% and 1.6% respectively.[30]\n\n\nSwitzerland's economy was marred by slow growth in the 1990s, having the weakest economic growth in Western Europe. The economy was affected by a three-year recession from 1991 to 1993, when the economy contracted by 2%. The contraction also became apparent in Switzerland's energy consumption and export growth rates. Switzerland's economy averaged no appreciable increase (only 0.6% annually) in GDP.\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

It employs about 1\u20133% of the workforce. Most farmers are engaged in dairy and meat production. Vineyards in the Moselle Valley annually produce about 15 million litres of dry white wine, most of which is consumed within Luxembourg and also in Germany, France, and Belgium on a lesser scale.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Data[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Luxembourg has been part of the eurozone since 1999.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBanking is the largest sector in the Luxembourg economy. In the 2019 Global Financial Centres Index, Luxembourg was ranked as having the 25th most competitive financial center in the world, and third most competitive in Europe after London and Z\u00fcrich.[21] The country has specialised in the cross-border fund administration business. As Luxembourg's domestic market is relatively small, the country's financial centre is predominantly international. At the end of March 2009, there were 152 banks in Luxembourg, with over 27,000 employees. Political stability, good communications, easy access to other European centres, skilled multilingual staff, a tradition of banking secrecy and cross-border financial expertise have all contributed to the growth of the financial sector. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | ![Increase](image)3.7%\n | ![Increase](image)1.7%\n | ![Negative increase](image)6.8%\n | ![Negative increase](image)23.7%\n |\n| 2014\n | ![Increase](image)54.8\n | ![Increase](image)99,738\n | ![Increase](image)5.8%\n | ![Increase](image)0.7%\n | ![Negative increase](image)7.1%\n | ![Positive decrease](image)22.7%\n |\n| 2015\n | ![Increase](image)57.0\n | ![Increase](image)101,255\n | ![Increase](image)2.9%\n | ![Increase](image)0.1%\n | ![Positive decrease](image)6.8%\n | ![Positive decrease](image)22.0%\n |\n| 2016\n | ![Increase](image)59.5\n | ![Increase](image)103,286\n | ![Increase](image)3.1%\n | ![Increase](image)0.0%\n | ![Positive decrease](image)6.3%\n | ![Positive decrease](image)20.8%\n |\n| 2017\n | ![Increase](image)62.8\n | ![Increase](image)106,373\n | ![Increase](image)3.5%\n | ![Negative increase](image)2.1%\n | ![Positive decrease](image)5.8%\n | ![Negative increase](image)23.0%\n |\n\n\n## Energy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Energy in Luxembourg\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn February 2016, the Government of Luxembourg announced that it would attempt to \"jump-start an industrial sector to mine asteroid resources in space\" by, among other things, creating a \"legal framework\" and regulatory incentives for companies involved in the industry.[38][39]\nBy June 2016, announced that it would \"invest more than US$200 million in research, technology demonstration, and in the direct purchase of equity in companies relocating to Luxembourg.\"[40] By April 2017, three space mining corporations had established headquarters established in Luxembourg.[41]\n\n\nLuxembourg's new law took effect in August 2017, ensuring that private operators can be confident about their rights on resources they extract in space. The law provides that space resources can be owned by anyone, not just by Luxembourg citizens or companies.\"[42]\n\n\n\n## Transportation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transportation in Luxembourg\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Economy of Europe\n* List of companies of Luxembourg\n* The Integrated Traffic and Landscape Concept for the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg\n* Social Welfare in Luxembourg\n* Luxembourg for Finance\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 1978, Luxembourg tried to build a 1,200 MW nuclear reactor but dropped the plans after threats of major protests.[33]\nCurrently, Luxembourg uses imported oil and natural gas for the majority of its energy generation.[34]\n\n\n\n## Spaceflight and space resource extraction[edit]\n\n\nLuxembourg is a member of the European Space Agency[35]\nwhere Luxembourg contributed 23 million Euros in 2015.[36]\n\n\nThe world's biggest satellite operator (SES Global) has its origin and headquarters in Betzdorf, Luxembourg.[37]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSince the Holding Act of 1929, Luxembourg has been an attractive location for tax avoidance.[23] A network of lawyers, bankers and political elites have since then maintained an infrastructure of regulatory codes, legal expertise and shell companies that enable tax avoidance.[24] Concern about Luxembourg's banking secrecy laws, and its reputation as a tax haven, led in April 2009 to it being added to a \"grey list\" of nations with questionable banking arrangements by the G20,[25] a list from which it was removed in 2009.[26] This concern has led Luxembourg to modify its tax legislation to avoid conflict with the tax authorities of European Union Members. For example, the classic tax exempt 1929 Holding Company was outlawed 31 December 2010, as it was deemed an illegal state aid by the European Commission.[27]\n\n\n\n### Steel[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Year\n | GDP(in Bil.

Total assets exceeded \u20ac929 billion at the end of 2008. More than 9,000 holding companies are established in Luxembourg. The European Investment Bank\u2014the financial institution of the European Union\u2014is also located there.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nLuxembourg has efficient road, rail and air transport facilities and services. The road network has been significantly modernised in recent years with 147\u00a0km of motorways connecting the capital to adjacent countries. The advent of the high-speed TGV link to Paris has led to renovation of the city's railway station while a new passenger terminal at Luxembourg Airport has recently been opened. The airport has known a sustained growth in passenger numbers during the last years (2015: 2.7 mio, 2020\u00a0: 4 mio expected), and the second stage of expansion is on its way.\n\n\nTrams have been reintroduced to the capital (first core line operative in end 2017) and further lines are planned, including a tram/light-rail to Esch-sur-Alzette. In 2019, almost all public transport was made free to use for both residents and visitors.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
