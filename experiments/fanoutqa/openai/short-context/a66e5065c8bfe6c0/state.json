In the context of the 2012\u201313 North American drought (especially the 2011\u201317 California drought), as well as powerful Santa Ana winds, weather conditions were ideal for wildfires. A total of 7,865 wildfires ignited throughout the year, which burned at least 625,540 acres (2,531.5\u00a0km2) of land.[5][1] The wildfires caused a total of 146 injuries and 2 fatalities, in addition to causing at least $204.05 million (2014 USD) in damage.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2014, a study examined the human role in growing California wildfire risks.[8] The paper is titled \"Extreme fire season in California: A glimpse into the future?\" It was published as the second chapter of \"Explaining Extreme Events of 2014\", by the American Meteorological Society.[9] The authors also projected into the future, and the predicted results showed increases in the drought index, the area under extreme threat of fires, and the days of fire danger, stating that, \"The increase in extreme fire risk is expected within the coming decade to exceed that of natural variability and this serves as an indication that anthropogenic climate warming will likely play a significant role in influence California\u2019s fire season.\"[9]\n\n\n\n\n## Fires[edit]\n\n\nBelow is a list of all fires that exceeded 1,000 acres (400\u00a0ha) during the 2014 California wildfire season, as well as the fires that caused significant damage.[10] The list is taken from CAL FIRE's list of large fires.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFor the swarm of large wildfires that were ablaze in San Diego County, California during May 2014, see May 2014 San Diego County wildfires.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| 2014 California wildfires |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)Satellite image of the wildfires in Southern California and Baja California, on May 15, 2014.\n |\n| Statistics[2][3][4][5][6] |\n| Total fires | 7,865 |\n| Total area | 625,540 acres (2,531\u00a0km2)[1] |\n| Impacts |\n| Deaths | 4 confirmed |\n| Non-fatal injuries | At least 146 |\n| Damage | At least $204.05 million (2014 USD) |\n| Season |\n| \u2190\u00a02013\n\n2015\u00a0\u2192\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

It was the third-warmest year on record for the United States, and it was the second-hottest in California, bringing to the surface the question of long-term climate change and its contribution to the 2017 California fires. The hotter temperatures dry out vegetation, making them easier to burn, predisposing vulnerable regions like California to more wildfires in the coming decades as temperatures continue to rise and rainfall continues to decline.[12] Historically, it has been estimated that prior to 1850, about 4.5 million acres (17,000 km\u00b2) burned yearly, in fires that lasted for months.[20]\n\n\n\n\n## Wildfire maps[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
