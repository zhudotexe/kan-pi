Conflicting statements regarding Fultz's health and poor production continued to be sources of conflict and drama for the team. On November 20, 2018, his agent Raymond Brothers announced Fultz would not participate in practice or games until a shoulder injury was evaluated; his ailment was later described as thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS), the neurogenic type of the disorder which \u201caffects nerves between the neck and shoulder resulting in abnormal functional movement and range of motion, thus severely limiting Markelle\u2019s ability to shoot a basketball\u201d.[35][36]\n\n\n\n### Orlando Magic (2019\u2013present)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n39. **^** Botkin, Brad (October 23, 2019). \"Markelle Fultz shows a lot of promise in Magic debut, looks comfortable, explosive as a scorer and creator\". *CBS Sports*.\n40. **^** \"Magic defeat Wizards 120-113 as Westbrook sits\". *espn.com*.

Although he started as a power forward for the Jayhawks, not Jackson's normal positions of both small forward or shooting guard, he still recorded 16.3 points, 7.4 rebounds, 3.0 assists, 1.7 steals, and 1.1 blocks per game with the team in his freshman season.[18] As a result of his efforts, he was named as an All-Big 12 First Team member, the Big 12 Freshman of the Year, was named as a second-team All-American according to Sporting News, and was also considered a third-team All-American according to the Associated Press and National Association of Basketball Coaches.

During the entire pre-season, Jackson was forced into the role of the leading shooting guard, trying to replicate the role of Devin Booker, who was out at the time due to finger surgery. In the season debut on October 17, 2018, Jackson returned to the bench for the team, as he recorded 18 points on 7/11 shooting, including 3/4 three-pointers made, in a 121\u2013100 blowout win over the Dallas Mavericks.[30]\n\n\n\n### Memphis Grizzlies (2019\u20132020)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n44. **^** Spears, Marc J.

Fox goes by the nicknames \u201cFox\u201d, \u201cSwipa\u201d, and \u201cSwipa da Fox\u201d. Fox chose the number zero at Kentucky because he \u201cfears no one\u201d, giving his original number five to teammate Malik Monk.[7] According to his high school coach, Fox would come to school at 6 AM and practice in the gym every morning. Fox would sleep on the couch almost every night and play the *NBA 2K* video game series. This, according to his father, is one of the reasons he has developed into the player that he is today.[39]\n\n\nFox signed a multi-year endorsement deal with Nike prior to the 2017 NBA draft.[40]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn November 5, 2022, Fox put up 37 points, alongside a buzzer-beating, game-winning three, in a 126\u2013123 overtime win over the Orlando Magic.[25] He was named the Western Conference Player of the Week for November 14\u201320 after leading Sacramento to a 3\u20130 record, where he averaged 25 points, 3.7 rebounds and 8 assists per game.[26] On December 28, Fox recorded 31 points and a season-high 13 assists in a 127\u2013126 win over the Denver Nuggets.[27] On February 10, 2023, he was named an All-Star for the first time in his career as a reserve. Fox and Anthony Edwards were announced as injury replacements for injured stars Stephen Curry and Zion Williamson.[28] On February 24, Fox recorded a season-high 42 points, 12 assists, five rebounds and five steals in a 176\u2013175 double overtime win over the Los Angeles Clippers. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nComing out of Kentucky, Fox was highly regarded among scouts for his quickness, speed, and athleticism.[35] These attributes combined make Fox one of the most dangerous players on the fast break and driving to the rim. Fox himself stated in 2018 \"If we\u2019re talking about from baseline to baseline with the ball in my hands, I\u2019m definitely the fastest person in the league.\"[36]\n\n\nFox is a high end finisher at the rim, being able to use his body control and leaping ability to finish layups and draw fouls and often using his speed and quickness to blow by defenders. Fox is considered to be a poor 3-point shooter, as during the 2019\u20132020 NBA season, Fox shot a career low 29.2% shooting percentage from three.[37]\n\n\nFox has also demonstrated good passing ability, averaging around seven assists per game.[37] Fox generates most of his assists running the pick and roll and the fast break.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n25. **^** Guinhawa, Angelo (November 5, 2022). \"VIDEO: Kings star De'Aaron Fox breaks Magic's heart with ruthless logo buzzer-beater in OT\". *ClutchPoints*.

This was the Kings\u2019 first game in the Orlando bubble, returning from a 4-month hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[19]\n\n\nOn November 25, 2020, Fox signed a contract extension with the Kings.[20] On February 8, 2021, Fox was named Western Conference Player of the Week for the first time in his career averaging 31 points & nearly 9 assists while winning all 4 games on the first week of February.

Fox averaged nearly 37 points & 5 assists per game while shooting 64% from the field over the 4 games, all ending in victories for the Kings.[22]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn January 25, 2018, Fox scored 14 points, 4 assist and a putback slam dunk with 3.3 seconds left giving the Sacramento Kings the lead in an 89\u201388 win over the Miami Heat. On January 28, 2018, Fox scored a season-high 26 points, going 6\u20136 from three-point range in a 15-point loss to the San Antonio Spurs.[18] On February 14, Fox was named Lonzo Ball's replacement for the Rising Stars Challenge.\n\n\nOn November 1, 2018, during a 146\u2013115 win over the Atlanta Hawks, Fox notched his first career triple-double with 31 points, 10 rebounds, and 15 assists to bring the Kings to a 6\u20133 record, becoming the only player after LeBron James in 2005 to score a 30-point triple double before the age of 21. Fox drastically improved during the 2018\u20132019 season. Not only did he improve in every major statistical category (Including his points per game from 11.6 to 17.3 and assists per game from 4.4 to 7.3), He also finished top 3 and was nominated for the NBA Most Improved Player Award, finishing second to Pascal Siakam.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
