The university consists of twelve faculties and offers degree programmes at undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral levels in some 100 disciplines.[7] The language of instruction is usually German, while a considerable number of graduate degrees are offered in English as well as some in French.[8][9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHeidelberg is a city with approximately 140,000 inhabitants. It is situated in the Rhine Neckar Triangle, a European metropolitan area with approximately 2.4 million people living there, comprising the neighboring cities of Heidelberg, Mannheim, Ludwigshafen, and a number of smaller towns in the perimeter. Heidelberg is known as the cradle of Romanticism, and its old town and castle are among the most frequented tourist destinations in Germany. Its pedestrian zone is a shopping and night life magnet for the surrounding area and beyond. Heidelberg is about 40\u00a0minutes by train away from Frankfurt International Airport.[43]\nHeidelberg University's facilities are, generally speaking, separated in two parts. The faculties and institutes of humanities and social sciences are embedded in the Old Town Campus. The sciences faculties and the medical school, including three large university hospitals, are located on the New Campus in the Neuenheimer Feld on the outskirts of Heidelberg.[44]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs a consequence of the disturbances caused by the French Revolution, and particularly because of the Treaty of Lun\u00e9ville, the university lost all its property on the left bank of the Rhine, so that its complete dissolution was expected.[31]\n\n\n\n### 19th and early 20th century[edit]\n\n\nThis decline did not stop until 1803, when the university was reestablished as a state-owned institution by Karl Friedrich, Grand Duke of Baden, to whom the part of the Palatinate situated on the right bank of the Rhine was allotted. Since then, the university bears his name together with the name of Ruprecht I. Karl Friedrich divided the university into five faculties and placed himself at its head as rector, as did also his successors. During this decade, Romanticism found expression in Heidelberg through Clemens Brentano, Achim von Arnim, Ludwig Tieck, Joseph G\u00f6rres, and Joseph von Eichendorff, and there went forth a revival of the German Middle Ages in speech, poetry, and art.[28]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Dr\u00fcll, Dagmar (1991) [1986]. *Heidelberger Gelehrtenlexikon, Bd. 1: 1803\u20131932, Bd. 2: 1652\u20131802, Bd. 3: 1386\u20131651, Bd. 4: 1933\u20131986* (in German).

The university was founded on 2 December 1409 by Frederick I, Elector of Saxony and his brother William II, Margrave of Meissen, and originally comprised the four scholastic faculties. Since its inception, the university has engaged in teaching and research for over 600 years without interruption.\n\n\nFamous alumni include Angela Merkel, Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Leopold von Ranke, Friedrich Nietzsche, Robert Schumann, Richard Wagner, Tycho Brahe, Georgius Agricola. The university is associated with ten Nobel laureates, most recently with Svante P\u00e4\u00e4bo who won the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 2022.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Memorial stone to the foundation of Leipzig University\n### Founding and development until 1900[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Official website of Leipzig University\n* History of the Leipzig University\n* Herbermann, Charles, ed.

It was demolished by the socialist administration in 1968.\nThe university was modelled on the University of Prague, from which the German-speaking faculty members withdrew to Leipzig after the Jan Hus crisis and the Decree of Kutn\u00e1 Hora. The *Alma mater Lipsiensis* opened in 1409, after it had been officially chartered by Pope Alexander V in his *Bull of Acknowledgment* on (9 September of that year). Its first rector was Johannes Otto von M\u00fcnsterberg. From its foundation, the Paulinerkirche served as the university church. After the Reformation, the church and the monastery buildings were donated to the university in 1544. In order to secure independent and sustainable funding, the university was endowed with the lordship over nine villages east of Leipzig (university villages). It kept this status for nearly 400 years until land reforms were carried out in the 19th century. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the field of anthropology, the university is cooperating with the Leipzig Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology. In 1995, the Leibniz-Institute for Jewish History and Culture named after Simon Dubnow was formed as a research institution related to the university. Since 2008 the university is also home to one of Germany's few Confucius Institutes. The institute is based on an agreement of June 2006 between the university administration and representatives of the Chinese Embassy to establish a Confucius Institute in cooperation with the Renmin University and the \"National Office for Teaching Chinese as a Foreign Language\". Leipzig University has been the home of the first German chair for Chinese and East Asian Languages in the 19th century, which later became the Institute of East Asian Studies, which still exists today (see Georg von der Gabelentz).\n\n\n### Rankings[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| University rankings |\n| --- |\n| Overall \u2013 Global & National |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring the first centuries, the university grew slowly and was a rather regional institution. This changed, however, during the 19th century when the university became a world-class institution of higher education and research.[*citation needed*] At the end of the 19th century, important scholars such as Bernhard Windscheid (one of the fathers of the German Civil Code) and Wilhelm Ostwald (viewed as a founder of modern physical chemistry) taught at Leipzig.\n\n\n\n![](image)Formerly organized as a collegiate university, the Red College of Leipzig University was established in the 16th century.\nLeipzig University was one of the first German universities to allow women to register as \"guest students\".[3] At its general assembly in 1873, the Allgemeiner Deutscher Frauenverein\u00a0[de] thanked the University of Leipzig and Prague for allowing women to attend as guest students. This was the year that the first woman in Germany obtained her JD, Johanna von Evreinov.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe dominant building of the university was the University Tower (now City-Hochhaus Leipzig), built between 1968 and 1972 in the form of an open book.\n\n\n\n### After the reunification of Germany[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Main building of Leipzig University since 2012, the Augusteum at Augustusplatz\n![](image)Leipzig's classicist university library, the Bibliotheca Albertina\nIn 1991, following the reunification of Germany, the university's name was restored to the original Leipzig University (*Alma mater lipsiensis*).

The university's buildings in the center of Leipzig underwent substantial reconstruction from 2005, the new university's main building being drafted by Dutch architect Erick van Egeraat. The estimated total cost for the renovation project is 140 million euros. The new buildings were scheduled to be completed in 2009/2010, in time for the university's 600th anniversary celebrations.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2008 the university was able to prevail in the nationwide \"Initiative of Excellence\" of Germany and it was granted the graduate school \"BuildMoNa: Leipzig School of Natural Sciences \u2013 Building with Molecules and Nano-objects\".[7] In addition, the university was able to receive grants from the Saxon excellence initiative for the \"Life\" project \u2013 a project that tries to explore common diseases more effectively. Also in 2008 the \"Bach Archive\" was associated with the university. In 2009, the Leipzig University celebrated its 600th anniversary with over 300 scientific and cultural lectures and exhibitions,[8] reflecting the role of the university's research and teaching from its beginning.\n\n\n\n## Campus[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

From 1487 to 1488 teaching took place in L\u00fcbeck. A few years after the city of Rostock, the university became Protestant in 1542. Henceforth, Humanism and Lutheranism were defining characteristics of the university.\n\n\nIn the 16th century, Rostock was the first university to teach Copernicanism, which was introduced by Professor Duncan Liddel.[8] After the Thirty Years' War (1618\u20131648), however, for about two centuries the University of Rostock played only a regional role. After the \"ownership\" of the university had moved from the city to the state (Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin) in 1827, however, things changed for the better. The second half of the 19th century saw generous building activity in Rostock's *alma mater* and the university soon regained its old reputation amongst German universities.\n\n\n\n### 1919 to present[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Detail of the central building depicting the coat of arms of Mecklenburg-Schwerin\n![](image)Memorial stone to the foundation of Rostock University, quadrangle of Wittenberg University\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### 1419\u20131919[edit]\n\n\nThe university was founded in 1419 by confirmation of Pope Martin V and thus is one of the oldest universities in Northern Europe.\n\n\nIn Germany, there are only five universities that were founded earlier, while only Heidelberg and Leipzig operated continuously since then: Heidelberg (1386), Cologne (1388), Erfurt (1392/1994), W\u00fcrzburg (1402/1582) and Leipzig (1409).\nThat makes Rostock University the third oldest German university in continuous operation.\n\n\nThroughout the 15th and 16th centuries, the University of Rostock had about 400 to 500 students each year and was among the most important universities in Germany and Northern Europe at the time, with many of its students originating from the Low Countries, Scandinavia or other countries bordering the Baltic Sea.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* ![United States](image) Brown University, United States\n* ![United States](image) University of Utah, United States\n* ![Syria](image) Arab International University (AIU), Syria\n* ![United States](image) University of Wyoming, United States\n* ![United States](image) University of Alabama in Huntsville, United States\n | \n |\n\n## Notable alumni and faculty[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Category:University of Rostock alumni, Category:Academic staff of the University of Rostock, and List of Rectors of University of Rostock\n\n![](image)Honorary doctorate certificate of Rostock University to Albert Einstein in 1919\nIn nearly six centuries numerous notable students and professors have had ties with the university, for instance:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Rostock Student Services (German: *Studentenwerk Rostock*) provides accommodation for newly arrived international students who plan to study at the University of Rostock and the Rostock University of Music and Theatre. International students, who have not lived or studied in Germany, are considered for a Starter Package service. However, short-time students and students on a programme (ERASMUS; Sokrates) are given a low priority.[12]\n\n\n\n### Rostock University Hospital[edit]\n\n\nThe university operates a hospital, which has several teaching and research institutes.[13] Among those are the Albrecht Kossel Institute for Neuroregeneration.\n\n\n\n## Points of interest[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The *Rostocker Pfeilstorch*, on display at the Institute of Zoology\n* Botanischer Garten Universit\u00e4t Rostock, the university's botanical garden\n* Zoological Collection Rostock, founded in 1775 by Oluf Gerhard Tychsen.

Over 500\u00a0million Euros have been invested in the university infrastructure since 1991, reaching 750\u00a0million Euros by 2015. The numbers of young people from Germany and of international students who choose Rostock as a place to study are increasing every year. As of today, students from at least 99 different countries have studied at Rostock. In 2007, the University of Rostock reorganized its research capacities into three profile lines: *Life, Light & Matter*, *Maritime Systems*, and *Aging of Individuals and Societies*. In 2010, a fourth profile was added, called *Knowledge \u2013 Culture \u2013 Transformation*.\n\n\n\n## Organization and structure[edit]\n\n\nLike many continental European universities, the University of Rostock is divided into academic faculties (German: *Fakult\u00e4t*). Those can be sub-divided into academic departments (German: *Institut*) and chairs (German: *Lehrstuhl*).\n\n\n\n### Faculties[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nARWU ranked University of Rostock among 101\u2013150 in Chemistry in the world in 2014.[16] In 2014, the CWTS Leiden Ranking ranked University of Rostock in the world as 269th in Natural Sciences, 336th in Life Sciences, 463rd in Medical Sciences, 449th in Mathematics, Computer Science and Engineering, and 245th in Cognitive Science.[17] According to the University Ranking by Academic Performance (URAP), Rostock University was ranked 224th worldwide in Chemistry in 2014.[18]\n\n\nThe CWTS Leiden Ranking ranked University of Rostock as 405th in 2014.[19]\n\n\nIn 2014, the Center for World University Rankings (CWUR) ranked University of Rostock as 481st in the world.[20]\n\n\nAccording to the University Ranking by Academic Performance (URAP), Rostock University was ranked as 34th in Germany and 428th in the world in 2014.[21]\n\n\n\n### Research[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe end of the Second World War in 1945 brought many changes. The university, now finding itself in the Soviet Zone of Germany (the later German Democratic Republic), was re-opened on 24 February 1946. The Faculty of Law was closed in 1951, a Faculty of Agriculture was introduced in 1950 and in 1951 saw the opening of a Department of Shipbuilding (renamed Faculty of Technology in 1963). The University of Rostock was the first traditional university in Germany to open a technical faculty. In 1952, the Faculty of Aviation was opened, but eventually relocated to Dresden.\n\n\nIn 1976 the university was renamed Wilhelm-Pieck-Universit\u00e4t after Wilhelm Pieck, the first president of the German Democratic Republic. The renaming was annulled after the German reunification.\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

As Greifswald is a small, coastal student town, the relationship between the university and the town has mostly been close. For instance, it was Heinrich Rubenow, then lord mayor of the city, who pushed for the establishment of a university in his town, and who became the university's first rector in the year 1456.\nThe **University of Greifswald** (German pronunciation: [\u02c8\u0261\u0281a\u026afsvalt]; German: *Universit\u00e4t Greifswald*), formerly known as \"Ernst-Moritz-Arndt University of Greifswald\", is a public research university located in Greifswald, Germany, in the state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFounded in 1456 (teaching existed since 1436[2]), it is one of the oldest universities in Europe, with generations of notable alumni and staff having studied or worked in Greifswald. As the fourth oldest university in present Germany, it was temporarily also the oldest university of the Kingdoms of Sweden (1648\u20131815) and Prussia (1815\u20131945), respectively. Approximately two-thirds of the 10,179[4] students are from outside the state, including international students from 90 countries all over the world. Due to the small-town atmosphere, the pronounced architectural presence of the alma mater across town, and the young, academic flair in the streets, Greifswald is often described as a \"university with a town built around it\" rather than a town with a university. Being a vast research community, the university aims at expanding its academic connections globally.[5]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### 1456\u20131600: Founding[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Startseite \u2013 Universit\u00e4t Greifswald\". *www.uni-greifswald.de*.

This was possible due to the great commitment of Greifswald's lord mayor, Heinrich Rubenow, who was also to become the university's first rector, with the support of Duke Wartislaw IX of Pomerania and Bishop Henning Iven of the local St Nicolas' Cathedral. The founding took place in the local cathedral, which was later remodeled by Caspar David Friedrich and his brother and can still be visited today. The founding of the university was made possible by a decree that restricted teaching activity at the University of Rostock (founded 1419). Several professors left Rostock for Greifswald to continue their work there, where Heinrich Rubenow took the chance of establishing his own university. Originally, the university consisted of the four traditional divisions: Theology, Philosophy, Medicine and Law.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n14. **^** \"GWK besiegelt neues Forschungszentrum f\u00fcr Greifswald - Pharma-Institut wurde als Neubau von nationaler Bedeutung eingestuft\" [GWK erects new research center for Greifswald - Pharma Institute is classified as a new building of national importance]. *idw-online.de* (in German).

The university was founded in 1457 by the Habsburg dynasty as the second university in Austrian-Habsburg territory after the University of Vienna. Today, Freiburg is the fifth-oldest university in Germany, with a long tradition of teaching the humanities, social sciences and natural sciences and technology and enjoys a high academic reputation both nationally and internationally. The university is made up of 11 faculties and attracts students from across Germany as well as from over 120 other countries. Foreign students constitute about 18.2% of total student numbers.[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nUniversity of Freiburg| Albert-Ludwigs-Universit\u00e4t Freiburg\n |\n| ![](image) |\n| Latin: *Alma Mater Alberto-Ludoviciana* |\n| Motto | *Die Wahrheit wird euch frei machen* |\n| Motto in\u00a0English\n | The truth will set you free |\n| Type | Public |\n| Established | 21\u00a0September 1457; 566 years ago\u00a0(1457-09-21) |\n| Budget | \u20ac 340.1 million[1] |\n| Rector | Kerstin Krieglstein |\n| Academic staff\n | 4,602[1] |\n| Administrative staff\n | 2,136[1] |\n| Students | 24,391[1] |\n| Location | Freiburg im Breisgau\n, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg\n, Germany\n47\u00b059\u203239\u2033N 7\u00b050\u203249\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff47.99417\u00b0N 7.84694\u00b0E\ufeff / 47.99417; 7.84694 |\n| Campus | University town |\n| Colors | Blue, Red, White\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 |\n| Affiliations | * U15\n* EUA\n* IFPU\n* EUCOR\n* LERU\n* EPICUR\n* GUEI\n |\n| Website | www.uni-freiburg.de |\n| File:Logo Uni Freiburg.png |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPublic university in Freiburg, Germany\n\nNot to be confused with the University of Fribourg.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This article **needs additional citations for verification**.

Finally in 1820, he saved the university with an annual contribution. Since then, the university has been named Albert Ludwigs University of Freiburg (*Albert-Ludwigs-Universit\u00e4t Freiburg*) as an acknowledgement of gratitude by the university and the citizens of Freiburg.\n\n\nIn the 1880s, the population of the student body and faculty started to grow quickly. The scientific reputation of Albert Ludwigs University attracted several researchers such as economist Adolph Wagner, historians Georg von Below and Friedrich Meinecke, and jurists Karl von Amira and Paul Lenel.\n\n\nIn 1900, Freiburg became the first German university to accept female students. Before there had been no women at German universities.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe University of Freiburg is recognized in several university ranking systems. In the QS World University Rankings 2024, it holds the 192nd position globally and the 9th position nationally.[19] The Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2024 placed it 128th in the world and 11th in Germany.[20] The Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU) 2023 ranks it between 101st and 150th globally, and 5th nationally.[21]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** \"Universit\u00e4t in Zahlen\". *University of Freiburg* (in German).

As of October 2020, 22 Nobel laureates are affiliated with the University of Freiburg as alumni, faculty or researchers, and 15 academics have been honored with the highest German research prize, the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize, while working at the university.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Foundation[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWhen Freiburg became a part of the newly established Grand Duchy of Baden (in German \"*Gro\u00dfherzogtum Baden*\") in 1805 (after Napoleon occupied the area of the formerly Further Austria), a crisis began for the university in Freiburg. Indeed, there were considerations by Karl Friedrich, Grand Duke of Baden and Karl, Grand Duke of Baden to close down the university in Freiburg while both of them thought that the Grand Duchy could not afford to run two universities at the same time (the Ruprecht Karl University of Heidelberg had existed since 1386).\n\n\n\n### University of Freiburg[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the late 20th century, the university was part of a mass education campaign and expanded rapidly. The student body grew to 10,000 by the 1960s, and doubled to 20,000 students by 1980. In the 1970s, the faculty structure was changed to 14 departments, with the Faculty of Engineering becoming the 15th faculty in 1994. In 2002, the number of faculties was reduced to 11. The university opened a memorial dedicated to the victims of National Socialism among the students, staff, and faculty in 2003.[4]\n\n\nIn 2006, the University of Freiburg joined the League of European Research Universities (LERU). One year later, the university was chosen as one of nine German Universities of Excellence. However, it did not receive the third line of funding in 2012.\n\n\n\n### University seal[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn university rankings published in 2007 and 2008 by German magazines and periodicals (*Der Spiegel, Die Zeit, Focus*, etc.[22][23]) the University of Freiburg has established itself as one of Germany's top universities.[24] The faculties for law, medicine, economics, history, English studies, German studies, biology, dentistry, and pharmacology achieve especially high scores.[25][26][27] In regards to the natural sciences, the University of Freiburg ranked sixth in Europe and second in Germany[28] in a ranking from 2003 of the European Commission of the universities according to their overall impact on scientific research. The Centre for Higher Education Development, a German higher education think tank, periodically publishes comprehensive rankings of European Master's and PhD programs. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe university soon attracted many students, such as the humanists Geiler von Kaysersberg, Johann Reuchlin, and Jakob Wimpfeling. When Ulrich Zasius was teaching law (until 1536), Freiburg became a centre of humanist jurisprudence. From 1529 to 1535, Erasmus of Rotterdam after having left Basel, lived and taught in Freiburg, however, never at the university.[3] From around 1559 on, the university was housed at the *Altes Collegium* (\"Old College\"), today called the \"new town-hall\". The importance of the university decreased during the time of the Counter-Reformation. To counter reformatory tendencies, the administration of two faculties was handed over to the Roman Catholic order of the Jesuits in 1620. From 1682 on, the Jesuits built their college, as well as the Jesuit church (nowadays the \"University Church\" or *Universit\u00e4tskirche*).\n\n\n\n### Studium Gallicum[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)The green at the central *mensa* (cafeteria) on Rempartstra\u00dfe\nThe university has a combined undergraduate and graduate student population of around 21,600.[2] About 16% of these students are foreigners, from about 120 countries. Admission largely depends on the faculty and program applied for and is strictly merit based, with the average score of final secondary-school examinations (German *Abitur*) or A-levels playing an important role. Overall, in the fall of 2010, roughly 4,000 of around 26,000 applicants were admitted: this means that the university's acceptance rate that year was equal to 15.38%.[9]\n\n\nThe University of Freiburg offers a large variety of undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral degree programs at its 11 faculties in 150 fields of study.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n41. **^** \"Epistemology and Theory of Science\". *University College Freiburg*.

Founded in 1419,[3][4][5] it is the third-oldest university in Germany. It is the oldest university in continental northern Europe and the Baltic Sea area,[5] and 8th oldest in Central Europe.[6] It was the 5th university established in the Holy Roman Empire.\n\n\nThe university has been associated with four Nobel laureates: Albrecht Kossel, Karl von Frisch, Otto Stern, and Walter H. Schottky. It is a member of the European University Association. According to a ranking published by *Times Higher Education* in 2018, it is the most beautiful university in Germany and the fourth most beautiful university in all of Europe.[7] The language of instruction is usually German and English for some postgraduate studies.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* ![United States](image) Brown University, United States\n* ![United States](image) University of Utah, United States\n* ![Syria](image) Arab International University (AIU), Syria\n* ![United States](image) University of Wyoming, United States\n* ![United States](image) University of Alabama in Huntsville, United States\n | \n |\n\n## Notable alumni and faculty[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Category:University of Rostock alumni, Category:Academic staff of the University of Rostock, and List of Rectors of University of Rostock\n\n![](image)Honorary doctorate certificate of Rostock University to Albert Einstein in 1919\nIn nearly six centuries numerous notable students and professors have had ties with the university, for instance:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the course of political struggles and due to pressure from the church, the university moved to Greifswald in 1437 and remained there until 1443. From 1487 to 1488 teaching took place in L\u00fcbeck. A few years after the city of Rostock, the university became Protestant in 1542. Henceforth, Humanism and Lutheranism were defining characteristics of the university.\n\n\nIn the 16th century, Rostock was the first university to teach Copernicanism, which was introduced by Professor Duncan Liddel.[8] After the Thirty Years' War (1618\u20131648), however, for about two centuries the University of Rostock played only a regional role. After the \"ownership\" of the university had moved from the city to the state (Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin) in 1827, however, things changed for the better. The second half of the 19th century saw generous building activity in Rostock's *alma mater* and the university soon regained its old reputation amongst German universities.\n\n\n\n### 1919 to present[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Rostock Student Services (German: *Studentenwerk Rostock*) provides accommodation for newly arrived international students who plan to study at the University of Rostock and the Rostock University of Music and Theatre. International students, who have not lived or studied in Germany, are considered for a Starter Package service. However, short-time students and students on a programme (ERASMUS; Sokrates) are given a low priority.[12]\n\n\n\n### Rostock University Hospital[edit]\n\n\nThe university operates a hospital, which has several teaching and research institutes.[13] Among those are the Albrecht Kossel Institute for Neuroregeneration.\n\n\n\n## Points of interest[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The *Rostocker Pfeilstorch*, on display at the Institute of Zoology\n* Botanischer Garten Universit\u00e4t Rostock, the university's botanical garden\n* Zoological Collection Rostock, founded in 1775 by Oluf Gerhard Tychsen.

Over 500\u00a0million Euros have been invested in the university infrastructure since 1991, reaching 750\u00a0million Euros by 2015. The numbers of young people from Germany and of international students who choose Rostock as a place to study are increasing every year. As of today, students from at least 99 different countries have studied at Rostock. In 2007, the University of Rostock reorganized its research capacities into three profile lines: *Life, Light & Matter*, *Maritime Systems*, and *Aging of Individuals and Societies*. In 2010, a fourth profile was added, called *Knowledge \u2013 Culture \u2013 Transformation*.\n\n\n\n## Organization and structure[edit]\n\n\nLike many continental European universities, the University of Rostock is divided into academic faculties (German: *Fakult\u00e4t*). Those can be sub-divided into academic departments (German: *Institut*) and chairs (German: *Lehrstuhl*).\n\n\n\n### Faculties[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t+ Institute for Special Education Development and Rehabilitation\n\t+ Institute for Vocational Education\n\t+ Institute for English/American Studies\n\t+ Institute for German Studies\n\t+ Institute for Romance Studies\n\t+ Heinrich Schliemann Institute of Classical Studies\n\t+ Historical Institute\n\t+ Institute for Media Research\n\t+ Institute of Philosophy\n\t+ Institute of Sports Science\n\t+ Wossidlo Research Center for European Ethnology/Folklore\n\t+ Moritz Schlick Research Center\n\t+ Uwe Johnson Research Center\n\t+ Research and Documentation Center of the State of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania on the History of Dictatorships in Germany\n* **Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences**\n\t+ Institute of Business Administration\n\t+ Institute of Marketing and Services Research\n\t+ Institute of Sociology and Demography\n\t+ Institute of Political and Administrative Sciences\n\t+ Institute of Economics\n\n## Facilities[edit]\n\n\n### Rostock University Library[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nARWU ranked University of Rostock among 101\u2013150 in Chemistry in the world in 2014.[16] In 2014, the CWTS Leiden Ranking ranked University of Rostock in the world as 269th in Natural Sciences, 336th in Life Sciences, 463rd in Medical Sciences, 449th in Mathematics, Computer Science and Engineering, and 245th in Cognitive Science.[17] According to the University Ranking by Academic Performance (URAP), Rostock University was ranked 224th worldwide in Chemistry in 2014.[18]\n\n\nThe CWTS Leiden Ranking ranked University of Rostock as 405th in 2014.[19]\n\n\nIn 2014, the Center for World University Rankings (CWUR) ranked University of Rostock as 481st in the world.[20]\n\n\nAccording to the University Ranking by Academic Performance (URAP), Rostock University was ranked as 34th in Germany and 428th in the world in 2014.[21]\n\n\n\n### Research[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn recent years, the University of Rostock has undergone significant conceptual and organisational changes, which included the bundling of competences and research activities in the interdisciplinary, cross-faculty departments of the Interdisciplinary Faculty. Scientific priorities of the faculties have improved by including the interdisciplinary-based research units: Collaborative Research Centres, Research Training Groups, and Research Units.[22]\n\n\nThe university cooperates with several independent research centres.

The university, now finding itself in the Soviet Zone of Germany (the later German Democratic Republic), was re-opened on 24 February 1946. The Faculty of Law was closed in 1951, a Faculty of Agriculture was introduced in 1950 and in 1951 saw the opening of a Department of Shipbuilding (renamed Faculty of Technology in 1963). The University of Rostock was the first traditional university in Germany to open a technical faculty. In 1952, the Faculty of Aviation was opened, but eventually relocated to Dresden.\n\n\nIn 1976 the university was renamed Wilhelm-Pieck-Universit\u00e4t after Wilhelm Pieck, the first president of the German Democratic Republic. The renaming was annulled after the German reunification.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Michaeliskloster, part of the Rostock University Library (Special Historical Library Collections)\nThe Rostock University Library consists of 3 divisional libraries and several specialized libraries provides scientific literature and information for research, education and study. The university statistics shows about 3 million physical volumes recorded in the catalogue. It provides access to electronic journals (EZB) and specialized databases (DBIS). The library possesses large special collections of culturally historical and scientifically historical old books.[9] In the Patents and Standards Centre (PNZ), all DIN norms and regulations as well as the VDI guidelines are provided.[10] Moreover, the library also contains the university archive and the art treasure collection.[11]\n\n\n\n### Rostock Student Services[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn the occasion of the 500th anniversary of the university, Albert Einstein and Max Planck received honorary doctorates on 12 November 1919. This made the University of Rostock the world's first institute of higher learning to award this honour to Einstein. The doctorate was not revoked during the Nazi rule in Germany (1933\u20131945), despite such orders by the Nazis. The reason for this remains unknown.

For instance, it was Heinrich Rubenow, then lord mayor of the city, who pushed for the establishment of a university in his town, and who became the university's first rector in the year 1456.\nThe **University of Greifswald** (German pronunciation: [\u02c8\u0261\u0281a\u026afsvalt]; German: *Universit\u00e4t Greifswald*), formerly known as \"Ernst-Moritz-Arndt University of Greifswald\", is a public research university located in Greifswald, Germany, in the state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n19. **^** Senat. \"Senat \u2013 Ernst-Moritz-Arndt-Universit\u00e4t Greifswald\".

The name of Ernst Moritz Arndt was initially removed but restored in 1954. Several organisational changes were made during the time of the GDR, most of which were revoked in the 1990s after the German Reunification.\n\n\n\n### 1990\u2013present: Germany[edit]\n\n\nFreedom of science as well as the autonomy and self-administration of the university were re-established. The Faculty of Law and Economics was re-opened from 1991 to 1993. Extensive renovation took place since 1990. The dinosaur Emausaurus was named after the acronym of the university (*E*rnst-*M*oritz-*A*rndt-*U*niversit\u00e4t Greifswald) in 1990.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFounded in 1456 (teaching existed since 1436[2]), it is one of the oldest universities in Europe, with generations of notable alumni and staff having studied or worked in Greifswald. As the fourth oldest university in present Germany, it was temporarily also the oldest university of the Kingdoms of Sweden (1648\u20131815) and Prussia (1815\u20131945), respectively. Approximately two-thirds of the 10,179[4] students are from outside the state, including international students from 90 countries all over the world. Due to the small-town atmosphere, the pronounced architectural presence of the alma mater across town, and the young, academic flair in the streets, Greifswald is often described as a \"university with a town built around it\" rather than a town with a university. Being a vast research community, the university aims at expanding its academic connections globally.[5]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### 1456\u20131600: Founding[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n27. **^** \"Biological Station Hiddensee \u2013 Faculty \u2013 University of Greifswald\". *biologie.uni-greifswald.de*.

This was possible due to the great commitment of Greifswald's lord mayor, Heinrich Rubenow, who was also to become the university's first rector, with the support of Duke Wartislaw IX of Pomerania and Bishop Henning Iven of the local St Nicolas' Cathedral. The founding took place in the local cathedral, which was later remodeled by Caspar David Friedrich and his brother and can still be visited today. The founding of the university was made possible by a decree that restricted teaching activity at the University of Rostock (founded 1419). Several professors left Rostock for Greifswald to continue their work there, where Heinrich Rubenow took the chance of establishing his own university. Originally, the university consisted of the four traditional divisions: Theology, Philosophy, Medicine and Law.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| *\"The University of Greifswald is one of those frequently mentioned 'flagships of science' in our country.\"*\n |\n| \u2013 The President of Germany, Horst K\u00f6hler, at the 550th anniversary celebrations in 2006[67] |\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
