After successfully being selected in the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) primaries in January 2010,[14] Lai stood as the DPP candidate for the mayoral election on 27 November 2010, gaining 60.41% to defeat Kuomintang candidate Kuo Tien-tsai.[15][16] He took office on 25 December 2010.\n\n\nAs a result of his strong showing in the mayoral election coupled with his relative youth and his control of the DPP heartland city of Tainan, Lai was considered to be a potential candidate for a presidential run in 2016.[17] In 2013 an opinion poll ranked Lai as the most popular of the 22 city and county heads in Taiwan, with an approval rating of 87%.[18]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLai made on 5 June 2014 a visit to the city of Shanghai to assist an exhibition of art by the late Taiwanese painter Tan Ting-pho and met politicians of the Chinese Communist Party.[19][20]\n\n\nLai stood for reelection on 29 November 2014 against Huang Hsiu-shuang of the Kuomintang. His opponent was considered to have such an uphill task in the DPP stronghold that she rode a black horse through the streets of Tainan as an election stunt; a hopeful allusion to her status as a \"dark horse\".[21] Lai, on the other hand, did not plan many campaign activities, choosing to focus on mayoral duties.[22] He eventually won the election by 45 percentage points,[23][24] the largest margin of victory in any of the municipal races in the election.[25]\n\n\nLai stepped down as Mayor in September 2017, after being appointed to the Premiership.[26] He was succeeded in acting capacity by Lee Meng-yen.[27]\n\n\n\n## Premier (2017\u20132019)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Lai cabinet\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLai took office on 8 September as the 49th Premier of the Republic of China.[30] Following Lai's appointment as premier, Tsai's approval ratings reached 46%, rebounding by more than 16 points since August.[31] Lai made his first appearance as premier at the Legislative Yuan on 26 September, where he stated \"I am a political worker who advocates Taiwan independence\" but that \"We are already an independent sovereign nation called the Republic of China. We don't need a separate declaration of independence\".[32][33] Lai has appeared to have moderated his position on Taiwanese independence particularly when he proposed the idea of \"being close to China while loving Taiwan\" in June 2017.[34] He also expressed no desire to run against Tsai Ing-wen in the 2020 presidential election.[35] On 28 September, the New Party called on the KMT to join it in filing a formal complaint against the Premier for sedition.[36]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nTaiwanese politician (born 1959)\n\nIn this article, the surname is  *Lai*.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n41. **^** \"Premier Lai rescinds resignation, pledges to respect Taiwan's referendum results\". *Taiwan News*. 26 November 2018.

On 16 January, he set up his campaign office and began bringing in campaign staff and volunteers.[14][15][16] During a symposium in Kaohsiung, Ko revealed that the accusations of misconduct in the AIDS transplant incident were the main cause of his decision to run for Mayor.[17] After announcing his candidacy, Ko was hesitant about whether or not he should join the DPP and run as the DPP candidate.[18][19][20][21][22][23] He ultimately decided to run as an independent, but to retain coordination with the DPP.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn May 2013, the Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Justice suspected Ko of involvement in the misappropriation of National Science Council funds by creating fraudulent receipts, and asked Ko for an itemized list of payment details. Ko was thus drawn into the Accounting Act Amendment scandal, but the Control Yuan never brought charges. In June that year, Ko's emergency trauma care student Dr. Tseng Yue-tsee was hit by a drunk driver and sustained major trauma. She was brought to the Far Eastern Memorial Hospital.[13] Ko went to the hospital as soon as he was notified and oversaw her treatment, but she died. As a result of this incident, Ko started a foundation for the prevention of drunk driving. In August, Ko was invited by Control Yuan member Huang Huang-hsiung to attend a conference in Beijing and to visit Yan'an, Shaanxi Province. Ko became more focused on politics and announced his candidacy for Taipei City Mayor on 6 January 2014.\n\n\n\n## 2014 Taipei mayoral election[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n48. **^** Gutmann, Ethan (August 2014). *The Slaughter: Mass Killings, Organ Harvesting and China's Secret Solution to Its Dissident Problem*.

She is the director of Pediatrics for Taipei City Hospital, Heping Fuyou Women and Children's Health Branch. Ko and Chen had an arranged marriage, and have three children, one boy and two girls.[82] It is known throughout Taiwan that as a mayor Ko earns less than his wife. He once joked that in order to pay off their home mortgage, his wife still could not retire early.[83] Ko has claimed to have Asperger syndrome,[84][85] but, as of 2014, had not been diagnosed.[86] His son also has the condition.[87]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 20 June 2012, Ko organised a small treatment team for Chen Shui-bian, whose condition had worsened since his imprisonment, and issued a public statement signed by many prominent individuals in the medical community to demand Chen be released for medical treatment.[69] Ko has made numerous statements expressing his view that Chen should be released for treatment, and has also expressed his view that Chen's prosecution was purely political.[70][71][72][73][74][75]\n\n\nKo supported Tsai Ing-wen in her Presidential bid in 2012 and helped fundraising efforts for her campaign. He is also a permanent member of the pro-Tsai \u201cFriends of Ing Club\u201d.[76] Nevertheless, he has criticized Tsai's proposal for a Taiwan Consensus over lack of clarity.[77]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nKo Wen-je grew up in a modest household. His father, Ko Cheng-fa, had aspirations for Ko, as the eldest son, to become a medical doctor. His mother is Ho Jui-ying. After graduating from National Hsinchu Senior High School, Ko studied medicine for a year at National Yang-Ming University, before being accepted into the Medical School at NTU after resitting his university entrance exams.[6][7][8]\n\n\nBetween August 1986 and September 1988, Ko served in the 269th mechanized infantry division of the Republic of China Army to fulfill his military service obligation. He was a combat medic with the rank of second lieutenant.\n\n\n\n## Medical career[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
