Neptune, like Uranus, is an ice giant, a subclass of giant planet, because they are smaller and have higher concentrations of volatiles than Jupiter and Saturn.[70] In the search for exoplanets, Neptune has been used as a metonym: discovered bodies of similar mass are often referred to as \"Neptunes\",[71] just as scientists refer to various extrasolar bodies as \"Jupiters\".\n\n\n\n### Internal structure[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Extraterrestrial diamonds\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Miner, Ellis D.; Wessen, Randii R.

It is the fourth-largest planet in the Solar System by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. It is 17 times the mass of Earth, and slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus. Neptune is denser and physically smaller than Uranus because its greater mass causes more gravitational compression of its atmosphere. Being composed primarily of gases and liquids, it has no well-defined solid surface. The planet orbits the Sun once every 164.8 years at an orbital distance of 30.1 astronomical units (4.5 billion kilometres; 2.8 billion miles). It is named after the Roman god of the sea and has the astronomical symbol ![♆](image), representing Neptune's trident.[d]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNeptune is not visible to the unaided eye and is the only planet in the Solar System found by mathematical predictions rather than by empirical observation. Unexpected changes in the orbit of Uranus led Alexis Bouvard to hypothesise that its orbit was subject to gravitational perturbation by an unknown planet. After Bouvard's death, the position of Neptune was predicted from his observations, independently, by John Couch Adams and Urbain Le Verrier. Neptune was subsequently observed with a telescope on 23 September 1846[1] by Johann Galle within a degree of the position predicted by Le Verrier. Its largest moon, Triton, was discovered shortly thereafter, though none of the planet's remaining 14 known moons were located telescopically until the 20th century. The planet's distance from Earth gives it a very small apparent size, making it challenging to study with Earth-based telescopes. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNeptune's internal structure resembles that of Uranus. Its atmosphere forms about 5 to 10% of its mass and extends perhaps 10 to 20% of the way towards the core. Pressure in the atmosphere reaches about 10 GPa, or about 100,000 times that of Earth's atmosphere. Increasing concentrations of methane, ammonia and water are found in the lower regions of the atmosphere.[28]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n5. **^** Yeomans, Donald K. \"HORIZONS Web-Interface for Neptune Barycenter (Major Body=8)\".

Prominent absorption bands of methane exist at wavelengths above 600 nm, in the red and infrared portion of the spectrum. As with Uranus, this absorption of red light by atmospheric methane is part of what gives Neptune its blue hue,[82] although Neptune's blue differs from Uranus's milder light blue due to concentrated haze in the latter atmosphere.[83]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNeptune| ![](image)Photograph taken by NASA's *Voyager 2* in 1989\n |\n| Discovery[1] |\n| Discovered by | * Johann Galle\n* Urbain Le Verrier\n* John Couch Adams\n |\n| Discovery date | 23 September 1846 |\n| Designations |\n| Pronunciation | /ˈnɛptjuːn/ ⓘ[2] |\n| Named after\n | Latin *Neptunus*, via French *Neptune* |\n| Adjectives | Neptunian (/nɛpˈtjuːniən/),[3] Poseidean[4] |\n| Symbol | ![♆](image), historically also ![⯉](image) |\n| Orbital characteristics[5][a] |\n| Epoch J2000 |\n| Aphelion | 30.33 AU (4.54 billion km) |\n| Perihelion | 29.81 AU (4.46 billion km) |\n| Semi-major axis\n | 30.07 AU (4.50 billion km) |\n| Eccentricity | 0.008678 |\n| Orbital period (sidereal)\n | * 164.8 yr\n* 60,195 days\n* 89,666 Neptunian solar days[6]\n |\n| Orbital period (synodic)\n | 367.49 days[7] |\n| Average orbital speed\n | 5.43 km/s[7] |\n| Mean anomaly\n | 259.883° |\n| Inclination | 1.770° to ecliptic6.43° to Sun's equator0.74° to invariable plane[8] |\n| Longitude of ascending node\n | 131.783° |\n| Time of perihelion\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMain article: Discovery of Neptune\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n27. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Suomi, V.E.; Limaye, S.S.; Johnson, D.R.

Presently available data does not allow a scientific determination of which model is correct.[81] The fluid interior structure of Uranus means that it has no solid surface.

In 1845, Urbain Le Verrier began his own independent research into Uranus's orbit. On 23 September 1846, Johann Gottfried Galle located a new planet, later named Neptune, at nearly the position predicted by Le Verrier.[69]\n\n\nThe rotational period of the interior of Uranus is 17 hours, 14 minutes. As on all giant planets, its upper atmosphere experiences strong winds in the direction of rotation. At some latitudes, such as about 60 degrees south, visible features of the atmosphere move much faster, making a full rotation in as little as 14 hours.[70]\n\n\n\n### Axial tilt[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nUranus| ![](image)Photograph of Uranus in true colour by *Voyager 2* in 1986.\n |\n| Discovery |\n| Discovered by | William Herschel |\n| Discovery date | 13 March 1781 |\n| Designations |\n| Pronunciation | /ˈjʊərənəs/ ⓘ[1] or /jʊˈreɪnəs/ ⓘ[2] |\n| Named after\n | the Latin form *Ūranus* of the Greek god Οὐρανός *Ouranos* |\n| Adjectives | Uranian (/jʊˈreɪniən/)[3] |\n| Symbol | ![⛢](image) (mostly astronomical), ![♅](image) (mostly astrological) |\n| Orbital characteristics[4][a] |\n| Epoch J2000 |\n| Aphelion | 20.0965 AU (3006.39 Gm) |\n| Perihelion | 18.2861 AU (2735.56 Gm) |\n| Semi-major axis\n | 19.19126 AU (2870.972 Gm) |\n| Eccentricity | 0.04717 |\n| Orbital period (sidereal)\n | * 84.0205 yr\n* 30,688.5 d[5]\n* 42,718 Uranian solar days[6]\n |\n| Orbital period (synodic)\n | 369.66 days[7] |\n| Average orbital speed\n | 6.80 km/s[7] |\n| Mean anomaly\n | 142.238600° |\n| Inclination | * 0.773° to ecliptic\n* 6.48° to Sun's equator\n* 0.99° to invariable plane[8]\n |\n| Longitude of ascending node\n | 74.006° |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nLunine, Jonathan I.

Much of the variability is dependent upon the planetary latitudes being illuminated from the Sun and viewed from the Earth.[78] Its angular diameter is between 3.4 and 3.7 arcseconds, compared with 16 to 20 arcseconds for Saturn and 32 to 45 arcseconds for Jupiter.[79] At opposition, Uranus is visible to the naked eye in dark skies, and becomes an easy target even in urban conditions with binoculars.[7] On larger amateur telescopes with an objective diameter of between 15 and 23 cm, Uranus appears as a pale cyan disk with distinct limb darkening. With a large telescope of 25 cm or wider, cloud patterns, as well as some of the larger satellites, such as Titania and Oberon, may be visible.[80]\n\n\n\n## Internal structure[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_qDRHzQoj7fJNtcv1oHv5bbvU","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

It is similar to Earth in size and mass and is often described as Earth's \"sister\" or \"twin\".[31] Venus is close to spherical due to its slow rotation.[32] Venus has a diameter of 12,103.6 km (7,520.8 mi)—only 638.4 km (396.7 mi) less than Earth's—and its mass is 81.5% of Earth's. Conditions on the Venusian surface differ radically from those on Earth because its dense atmosphere is 96.5% carbon dioxide, with most of the remaining 3.5% being nitrogen.[33] The surface pressure is 9.3 megapascals (93 bars), and the average surface temperature is 737 K (464 °C; 867 °F), above the critical points of both major constituents and making the surface atmosphere a supercritical fluid out of mainly supercritical carbon dioxide and some supercritical nitrogen.\n\n\n\n### Atmosphere and climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Atmosphere of Venus\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Mean radius\n | * 6,051.8±1.0 km[8]\n* 0.9499 Earths\n |\n| Flattening | 0[8] |\n| Surface area\n | * 4.6023×108 km2\n* 0.902 Earths\n |\n| Volume | * 9.2843×1011 km3\n* 0.857 Earths\n |\n| Mass | * 4.8675×1024 kg[9]\n* 0.815 Earths\n |\n| Mean density\n | 5.243 g/cm3 |\n| Surface gravity\n | * 8.87 m/s2\n* 0.904 *g*\n |\n| Escape velocity\n | 10.36 km/s (6.44 mi/s)[10] |\n| Synodic rotation period\n | −116.75 d (retrograde)[11]\n1 Venus solar day |\n| Sidereal rotation period\n | −243.0226 d (retrograde)[12] |\n| Equatorial rotation velocity\n | 6.52 km/h (1.81 m/s) |\n| Axial tilt\n | 2.64° (for retrograde rotation)177.36° (to orbit)[4][note 1] |\n| North pole right ascension\n | * 18h 11m 2s\n* 272.76°[13]\n |\n| North pole declination\n | 67.16° |\n| Albedo | * 0.689 (geometric)[14]\n* 0.76 (Bond)[15]\n |\n| Temperature | 232 K (−41 °C) (blackbody temperature)[16] |\n| \n\n| Surface temp. | min | mean | max |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Kelvin |  | 737 K[4] |  |\n| Celsius |  | 464 °C |  |\n| Fahrenheit |  | 867 °F |  |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nVenus has a dense atmosphere composed of 96.5% carbon dioxide, 3.5% nitrogen—both exist as supercritical fluids at the planet's surface with a 6.5% density of water—[34] and traces of other gases including sulfur dioxide.[35] The mass of its atmosphere is 92 times that of Earth's, whereas the pressure at its surface is about 93 times that at Earth's—a pressure equivalent to that at a depth of nearly 1 km (5⁄8 mi) under Earth's oceans. The density at the surface is 65 kg/m3 (4.1 lb/cu ft), 6.5% that of water[34] or 50 times as dense as Earth's atmosphere at 293 K (20 °C; 68 °F) at sea level. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nVenus has a weak induced magnetosphere and an especially thick carbon dioxide atmosphere, which creates, together with its global sulfuric acid cloud cover, an extreme greenhouse effect. This results at the surface in a mean temperature of 737 K (464 °C; 867 °F) and a crushing pressure of 92 times that of Earth's at sea level, turning the air into a supercritical fluid, while at cloudy altitudes of 50 km (30 mi) above the surface, the pressure, temperature and also radiation are very much like at Earth's surface. Conditions possibly favourable for life on Venus have been identified at its cloud layers, with recent research having found indicative, but not convincing, evidence of life on the planet. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe surface of Venus is effectively isothermal; it retains a constant temperature not only between the two hemispheres but between the equator and the poles.[4][70] Venus's minute axial tilt—less than 3°, compared to 23° on Earth—also minimises seasonal temperature variation.[71] Altitude is one of the few factors that affect Venusian temperatures. The highest point on Venus, Maxwell Montes, is therefore the coolest point on Venus, with a temperature of about 655 K (380 °C; 715 °F) and an atmospheric pressure of about 4.5 MPa (45 bar).[72][73] In 1995, the *Magellan* spacecraft imaged a highly reflective substance at the tops of the highest mountain peaks, a \"Venus snow\" that bore a strong resemblance to terrestrial snow. This substance likely formed from a similar process to snow, albeit at a far higher temperature. Too volatile to condense on the surface, it rose in gaseous form to higher elevations, where it is cooler and could precipitate. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nVenus| ![](image)Near-global view of Venus in natural colour, taken by the MESSENGER space probe\n |\n| Designations |\n| Pronunciation | /ˈviːnəs/ ⓘ |\n| Named after\n | Roman goddess of love (see goddess Venus) |\n| Adjectives | Venusian /vɪˈnjuːziən, -ʒən/,[1] rarely Cytherean /sɪθəˈriːən/[2] or Venerean / Venerian /vɪˈnɪəriən/[3] |\n| Symbol | ![♀](image) |\n| Orbital characteristics[4][5] |\n| Epoch J2000 |\n| Aphelion | 0.728213 AU (108.94 million km) |\n| Perihelion | 0.718440 AU (107.48 million km) |\n| Semi-major axis\n | 0.723332 AU (108.21 million km) |\n| Eccentricity | 0.006772[6] |\n| Orbital period (sidereal)\n | * 224.701 d[4]\n* 0.615198 yr\n* 1.92 Venus solar day\n |\n| Orbital period (synodic)\n | 583.92 days[4] |\n| Average orbital speed\n | 35.02 km/s |\n| Mean anomaly\n | 50.115° |\n| Inclination | * 3.39458° to ecliptic\n* 3.86° to Sun's equator\n* 2.15° to invariable plane[7]\n |\n| Longitude of ascending node\n | 76.680°[6] |\n| Argument of perihelion\n | 54.884° |\n| Satellites | None |\n| Physical characteristics |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe permanent cloud cover means that although Venus is closer than Earth to the Sun, it receives less sunlight on the ground, with only 10% of the received sunlight reaching the surface,[66] resulting in average daytime levels of illumination at the surface of 14,000 lux, comparable to that on Earth \"in the daytime with overcast clouds\".[67] Strong 300 km/h (185 mph) winds at the cloud tops go around Venus about every four to five Earth days.[68] Winds on Venus move at up to 60 times the speed of its rotation, whereas Earth's fastest winds are only 10–20% rotation speed.[69]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSlowed by its strong atmospheric current the length of the day also fluctuates by up to 20 minutes.[142] Venus's equator rotates at 6.52 km/h (4.05 mph), whereas Earth's rotates at 1,674.4 km/h (1,040.4 mph).[note 2][146] Venus's rotation period measured with *Magellan* spacecraft data over a 500-day period is smaller than the rotation period measured during the 16-year period between the Magellan spacecraft and *Venus Express* visits, with a difference of about 6.5 minutes.[147] Because of the retrograde rotation, the length of a solar day on Venus is significantly shorter than the sidereal day, at 116.75 Earth days (making the Venusian solar day shorter than Mercury's 176 Earth days — the 116-day figure is close to the average number of days it takes Mercury to slip underneath the Earth in its orbit).[11] One Venusian year is about 1.92 Venusian solar days.[148] To an observer on the surface of Venus, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn December 2015, and to a lesser extent in April and May 2016, researchers working on Japan's *Akatsuki* mission observed bow shaped objects in the atmosphere of Venus.

From the year 1 to 5383, there are 526 approaches less than 40 million km (25 million mi); then, there are none for about 60,158 years.[166]\n\n\nWhile Venus approaches Earth the closest, Mercury is more often the closest to Earth of all planets.[167] Venus has the lowest gravitational potential difference to Earth than any other planet, needing the lowest delta-v to transfer between them.[168][169]\n\n\nTidally Venus exerts the third strongest tidal force on Earth, after the Moon and the Sun, though significantly less.[170]\n\n\n\n## Observability[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![Spherical cross-section of Venus showing the different layers](image)The differentiated structure of Venus\nWithout data from reflection seismology or knowledge of its moment of inertia, little direct information is available about the internal structure and geochemistry of Venus.[123] The similarity in size and density between Venus and Earth suggests they share a similar internal structure: a core, mantle, and crust. Like that of Earth, the Venusian core is most likely at least partially liquid because the two planets have been cooling at about the same rate,[124] although a completely solid core cannot be ruled out.[125] The slightly smaller size of Venus means pressures are 24% lower in its deep interior than Earth's.[126] The predicted values for the moment of inertia based on planetary models suggest a core radius of 2,900–3,450 km.[125] This is in line with the first observation-based estimate of 3,500 km.[127]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe CO2-rich atmosphere generates the strongest greenhouse effect in the Solar System, creating surface temperatures of at least 735 K (462 °C; 864 °F).[36][37] This makes the Venusian surface hotter than Mercury's, which has a minimum surface temperature of 53 K (−220 °C; −364 °F) and maximum surface temperature of 700 K (427 °C; 801 °F),[38][39] even though Venus is nearly twice Mercury's distance from the Sun and thus receives only 25% of Mercury's solar irradiance.

It is weaker than Earth's gravity due to the planet's smaller mass. The average gravitational acceleration on Mars is 3.72076 ms−2 (about 38% of that of Earth) and it varies.[1] In general, topography-controlled isostasy drives the short wavelength free-air gravity anomalies.[2] At the same time, convective flow and finite strength of the mantle lead to long-wavelength planetary-scale free-air gravity anomalies over the entire planet.[3][4] Variation in crustal thickness, magmatic and volcanic activities, impact-induced Moho-uplift, seasonal variation of polar ice caps, atmospheric mass variation and variation of porosity of the crust could also correlate to the lateral variations.[5][6][7][8][9] Over the years models consisting of an increasing but limited number of spherical harmonics have been produced. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMaps produced have included free-air gravity anomaly, Bouguer gravity anomaly, and crustal thickness. In some areas of Mars there is a correlation between gravity anomalies and topography. Given the known topography, higher resolution gravity field can be inferred. Tidal deformation of Mars by the Sun or Phobos can be measured by its gravity. This reveals how stiff the interior is, and shows that the core is partially liquid.\nThe study of surface gravity of Mars can therefore yield information about different features and provide beneficial information for future landings.\n\n\n\n\n## Measurement[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rotating spherical harmonic, with \n\n\n\nℓ\n=\n0\n\n to \n\n4\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\ell =0{\\text{ to }}4}\n\n![{\\displaystyle \\ell =0{\\text{ to }}4}](image) for the vertical, and \n\n\n\nm\n=\n0\n\n to \n\n4\n\n\n{\\displaystyle m=0{\\text{ to }}4}\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBefore the arrival of the Mariner 9 and Viking orbiter spacecraft at Mars, only an estimate of the Mars gravitational constant GM, i.e. the universal constant of gravitation times the mass of Mars, was available for deducing the properties of the Martian gravity field.[14] GM could be obtained through observations of the motions of the natural satellites of Mars (Phobos and Deimos) and spacecraft flybys of Mars (Mariner 4 and Mariner 6).[14]\n\n\nLong term Earth-based observations of the motions of Phobos and Deimos provide physical parameters including semi-major axis, eccentricity, inclination angle to the Laplacian plane etc.,[15] which allow calculation of the ratio of solar mass to the mass of Mars, moment of inertia and coefficient of the gravitational potential of Mars, and give initial estimates of the gravity field of Mars.[15]\n\n\n\n### Inferred from radio tracking data[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n9. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** ***k*** ***l*** Goossens, Sander; Sabaka, Terence J.; Genova, Antonio; Mazarico, Erwan; Nicholas, Joseph B.; Neumann, Gregory A.

This is approximately two-fifths the orbital period of Saturn, forming a near orbital resonance.[130] The orbital plane of Jupiter is inclined 1.30° compared to Earth. Because the eccentricity of its orbit is 0.049, Jupiter is slightly over 75 million km nearer the Sun at perihelion than aphelion,[2] which means that its orbit is nearly circular. This low eccentricity is at odds with exoplanet discoveries, which have revealed Jupiter-sized planets with very high eccentricities. Models suggest this may be due to there being only two giant planets in our Solar System, as the presence of a third or more giant planets tends to induce larger eccentricities.[131]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Simpson, J.

The region where supercritical hydrogen changes gradually from a molecular fluid to a metallic fluid spans pressure ranges of 50–400 GPa with temperatures of 5,000–8,400 K (4,730–8,130 °C; 8,540–14,660 °F), respectively.

It lacks a definite surface, though it is likely to have a solid core.[36] Saturn's rotation causes it to have the shape of an oblate spheroid; that is, it is flattened at the poles and bulges at its equator. Its equatorial radius is more than 10% larger than its polar radius: 60,268 km versus 54,364 km.[6] Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune, the other giant planets in the Solar System, are also oblate but to a lesser extent. The combination of the bulge and rotation rate means that the effective surface gravity along the equator, 8.96 m/s2, is 74% of what it is at the poles and is lower than the surface gravity of Earth. However, the equatorial escape velocity of nearly 36 km/s is much higher than that of Earth.[37]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThis core is similar in composition to Earth, but is more dense. The examination of Saturn's gravitational moment, in combination with physical models of the interior, has allowed constraints to be placed on the mass of Saturn's core. In 2004, scientists estimated that the core must be 9–22 times the mass of Earth,[43][44] which corresponds to a diameter of about 25,000 km.[45] However, measurements of Saturn's rings suggest a much more diffuse core with a mass equal to about 17 Earths and a radius equal to around 60% of Saturn's entire radius.[46] This is surrounded by a thicker liquid metallic hydrogen layer, followed by a liquid layer of helium-saturated molecular hydrogen that gradually transitions to a gas with increasing altitude. The outermost layer spans 1,000 km and consists of gas.[47][48][49]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSaturn is the only planet of the Solar System that is less dense than water—about 30% less.[38] Although Saturn's core is considerably denser than water, the average specific density of the planet is 0.69 g/cm3 due to the atmosphere. Jupiter has 318 times Earth's mass,[39] and Saturn is 95 times Earth's mass.[6] Together, Jupiter and Saturn hold 92% of the total planetary mass in the Solar System.[40]\n\n\n\n### Internal structure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Diagram of Saturn, to scaleDespite consisting mostly of hydrogen and helium, most of Saturn's mass is not in the gas phase, because hydrogen becomes a non-ideal liquid when the density is above 0.01 g/cm3, which is reached at a radius containing 99.9% of Saturn's mass. The temperature, pressure, and density inside Saturn all rise steadily toward the core, which causes hydrogen to be a metal in the deeper layers.[40]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSaturn| ![](image)Pictured in natural color approaching equinox, photographed by *Cassini* in July 2008; the dot in the bottom left corner is Titan\n |\n| Designations |\n| Pronunciation | /ˈsætərn/ ⓘ[1] |\n| Named after\n | Saturn |\n| Adjectives | Saturnian /səˈtɜːrniən/,[2] Cronian[3] / Kronian[4] /ˈkroʊniən/[5] |\n| Symbol | ![♄](image) |\n| Orbital characteristics[6] |\n| Epoch J2000.0 |\n| Aphelion | 1,514.50 million km (10.1238 AU) |\n| Perihelion | 1,352.55 million km (9.0412 AU) |\n| Semi-major axis\n | 1,433.53 million km (9.5826 AU) |\n| Eccentricity | 0.0565 |\n| Orbital period (sidereal)\n | * 29.4475 yr\n* 10,755.70 d\n* 24,225 Saturnian solar days[7]\n |\n| Orbital period (synodic)\n | 378.09 days |\n| Average orbital speed\n | 9.68 km/s (6.01 mi/s) |\n| Mean anomaly\n | 317.020°[8] |\n| Inclination | * 2.485° to ecliptic[8]\n* 5.51° to Sun's equator[8]\n* 0.93° to invariable plane[9]\n |\n| Longitude of ascending node\n | 113.665° |\n| Time of perihelion\n | 2032-Nov-29[10] |\n| Argument of perihelion\n | 339.392°[8] |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Saturn** is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter.

For example, the recently discovered planet, Gliese 581 c, has at least 5 times the mass of Earth, but is unlikely to have 5 times its surface gravity. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n16. **^** Wald, Robert (1984). *General Relativity*.

A space station does not plummet to the ground because it is in an orbit around the Earth.\n\n\n\n## Gas giants[edit]\n\n\nFor gas giant planets such as Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, the surface gravity is given at the 1 bar pressure level in the atmosphere.[11]\n\n\n\n## Non-spherically symmetric objects[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Name\n | Surface gravity\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Sun | 28.02 *g* |\n| Mercury | 00.377 *g* |\n| Venus | 00.905 *g* |\n| Earth | 01 *g* (midlatitudes)\n |\n| Moon | 00.165 7 *g* (average)\n |\n| Mars | 00.379 *g* (midlatitudes)\n |\n| Phobos | 00.000 581 *g* |\n| Deimos | 00.000 306 *g* |\n| Pallas | 00.022 *g* (equator)\n |\n| Vesta | 00.025 *g* (equator)\n |\n| Ceres | 00.029 *g* |\n| Jupiter | 02.528 *g* (midlatitudes)\n |\n| Io | 00.183 *g* |\n| Europa | 00.134 *g* |\n| Ganymede | 00.146 *g* |\n| Callisto | 00.126 *g* |\n| Saturn | 01.065 *g* (midlatitudes)\n |\n| Mimas | 00.006 48 *g* |\n| Enceladus | 00.011 5 *g* |\n| Tethys | 00.014 9 *g* |\n| Dione | 00.023 7 *g* |\n| Rhea | 00.026 9 *g* |\n| Titan | 00.138 *g* |\n| Hyperion | 00.001 7–0.002 1 *g*(depending on location)\n |\n| Iapetus | 00.022 8 *g* |\n| Phoebe | 00.003 9–0.005 1 *g* |\n| Uranus | 00.886 *g* (equator)\n |\n| Miranda | 00.007 9 *g* |\n| Ariel | 00.025 4 *g* |\n| Umbriel | 00.023 *g* |\n| Titania | 00.037 2 *g* |\n| Oberon | 00.036 1 *g* |\n| Neptune | 01.137 *g* (midlatitudes)\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Lissajous orbits\n* Lyapunov orbits\n |\n| Engineering and efficiency\n |\n| Preflight engineering\n* Mass ratio\n* Payload fraction\n* Propellant mass fraction\n* Tsiolkovsky rocket equation\n |\n| Efficiency measures\n* Gravity assist\n* Oberth effect\n |\n| Propulsive maneuvers\n* Orbital maneuver\n* Orbit insertion\n |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\nThe **surface gravity**, *g*, of an astronomical object is the gravitational acceleration experienced at its surface at the equator, including the effects of rotation. The surface gravity may be thought of as the acceleration due to gravity experienced by a hypothetical test particle which is very close to the object's surface and which, in order not to disturb the system, has negligible mass. For objects where the surface is deep in the atmosphere and the radius not known, the surface gravity is given at the 1 bar pressure level in the atmosphere.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIf its mass is no more than 5 times that of the Earth, as is expected,[6] and if it is a rocky planet with a large iron core, it should have a radius approximately 50% larger than that of Earth.[7][8] Gravity on such a planet's surface would be approximately 2.2 times as strong as on Earth. If it is an icy or watery planet, its radius might be as large as twice the Earth's, in which case its surface gravity might be no more than 1.25 times as strong as the Earth's.[8]\n\n\nThese proportionalities may be expressed by the formula:\ng\n∝\n\n\nm\n\nr\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle g\\propto {\\frac {m}{r^{2}}}}\n![{\\displaystyle g\\propto {\\frac {m}{r^{2}}}}](image)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe fact that many large celestial objects are approximately spheres makes it easier to calculate their surface gravity. According to the shell theorem, the gravitational force outside a spherically symmetric body is the same as if its entire mass were concentrated in the center, as was established by Sir Isaac Newton.[5] Therefore, the surface gravity of a planet or star with a given mass will be approximately inversely proportional to the square of its radius, and the surface gravity of a planet or star with a given average density will be approximately proportional to its radius. For example, the recently discovered planet, Gliese 581 c, has at least 5 times the mass of Earth, but is unlikely to have 5 times its surface gravity. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nStandard surface gravity\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Part of a series on |\n| Astrodynamics |\n| ![](image) |\n| Orbital mechanics\n |\n| Orbital elements\n* Apsis\n* Argument of periapsis\n* Eccentricity\n* Inclination\n* Mean anomaly\n* Orbital nodes\n* Semi-major axis\n* True anomaly\n |\n| Types of two-body orbits by eccentricity\n* Circular orbit\n* Elliptic orbit\n\n\nTransfer orbit * (Hohmann transfer orbit\n* Bi-elliptic transfer orbit)\n\n* Parabolic orbit\n* Hyperbolic orbit\n* Radial orbit\n* Decaying orbit\n |\n| Equations\n* Dynamical friction\n* Escape velocity\n* Kepler's equation\n* Kepler's laws of planetary motion\n* Orbital period\n* Orbital velocity\n* Surface gravity\n* Specific orbital energy\n* Vis-viva equation\n |\n| Celestial mechanics\n |\n| Gravitational influences\n* Barycenter\n* Hill sphere\n* Perturbations\n* Sphere of influence\n |\n| N-body orbits\nLagrangian points * (Halo orbits)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIt is sometimes useful to calculate the surface gravity of simple hypothetical objects which are not found in nature.

A white dwarf's surface gravity is around 100,000 *g* (106 m/s2) whilst the neutron star's compactness gives it a surface gravity of up to 7×1012 m/s2 with typical values of order 1012 m/s2 (that is more than 1011 times that of Earth). One measure of such immense gravity is that neutron stars have an escape velocity of around 100,000 km/s, about a third of the speed of light. For black holes, the surface gravity must be calculated relativistically.\n\n\n\n\n## Relationship of surface gravity to mass and radius[edit]\n\n\n\n\nSurface gravity of various  \nSolar System bodies[3]  \n(1 *g* = 9.80665 m/s2, the average surface gravitational acceleration on Earth)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n16. **^** Wald, Robert (1984). *General Relativity*.

Newtonian gravity also follows an inverse square law, so that moving an object twice as far away divides its gravitational force by four, and moving it ten times as far away divides it by 100. This is similar to the intensity of light, which also follows an inverse square law: with relation to distance, light becomes less visible. Generally speaking, this can be understood as geometric dilution corresponding to point-source radiation into three-dimensional space.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![{\\displaystyle 2\\pi T=g-k}](image).[15]\n\n\n\n### Kerr–Newman solution[edit]\n\n\nThe surface gravity for the Kerr–Newman solution is\nκ\n=\n\n\n\n\nr\n\n+\n\n\n−\n\nr\n\n−\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n(\n\n\nr\n\n+\n\n\n2\n\n\n+\n\na\n\n2\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\nM\n\n2\n\n\n−\n\nQ\n\n2\n\n\n−\n\nJ\n\n2\n\n\n\n/\n\n\nM\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n2\n\nM\n\n2\n\n\n−\n\nQ\n\n2\n\n\n+\n2\nM\n\n\n\nM\n\n2\n\n\n−\n\nQ\n\n2\n\n\n−\n\nJ\n\n2\n\n\n\n/\n\n\nM\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\kappa ={\\frac {r\\_{+}-r\\_{-}}{2\\left(r\\_{+}^{2}+a^{2}\\right)}}={\\frac {\\sqrt {M^{2}-Q^{2}-J^{2}/M^{2}}}{2M^{2}-Q^{2}+2M{\\sqrt {M^{2}-Q^{2}-J^{2}/M^{2}}}}},}\n![{\\displaystyle \\kappa ={\\frac {r_{+}-r_{-}}{2\\left(r_{+}^{2}+a^{2}\\right)}}={\\frac {\\sqrt {M^{2}-Q^{2}-J^{2}/M^{2}}}{2M^{2}-Q^{2}+2M{\\sqrt {M^{2}-Q^{2}-J^{2}/M^{2}}}}},}](image)\n\nwhere \n\n\n\nQ\n\n\n{\\displaystyle Q}\n\n![{\\displaystyle Q}](image) is the electric charge, \n\n\n\nJ\n\n\n{\\displaystyle J}\n\n![{\\displaystyle J}](image) is the angular momentum, we define \n\n\n\n\nr\n\n±\n\n\n:=\nM\n±\n\n\n\nM\n\n2\n\n\n−\n\nQ\n\n2\n\n\n−\n\nJ\n\n2\n\n\n\n/\n\n\nM\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\textstyle r\\_{\\pm }:=M\\pm {\\sqrt {M^{2}-Q^{2}-J^{2}/M^{2}}}}\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWhen one talks about the surface gravity of a black hole, one is defining a notion that behaves analogously to the Newtonian surface gravity, but is not the same thing. In fact, the surface gravity of a general black hole is not well defined. However, one can define the surface gravity for a black hole whose event horizon is a Killing horizon.\n\n\nThe surface gravity \n\n\n\nκ\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\kappa }\n\n![{\\displaystyle \\kappa }](image) of a static Killing horizon is the acceleration, as exerted at infinity, needed to keep an object at the horizon. Mathematically, if \n\n\n\n\nk\n\na\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle k^{a}}\n\n![{\\displaystyle k^{a}}](image) is a suitably normalized Killing vector, then the surface gravity is defined by\nk\n\na\n\n\n\n\n∇\n\na\n\n\n\nk\n\nb\n\n\n=\nκ\n\nk\n\nb\n\n\n,\n\n\n{\\displaystyle k^{a}\\,\\nabla \\_{a}k^{b}=\\kappa k^{b},}\n![{\\displaystyle k^{a}\\,\\nabla _{a}k^{b}=\\kappa k^{b},}](image)\n\nwhere the equation is evaluated at the horizon. For a static and asymptotically flat spacetime, the normalization should be chosen so that \n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMost real astronomical objects are not perfectly spherically symmetric. One reason for this is that they are often rotating, which means that they are affected by the combined effects of gravitational force and centrifugal force. This causes stars and planets to be oblate, which means that their surface gravity is smaller at the equator than at the poles. This effect was exploited by Hal Clement in his SF novel *Mission of Gravity*, dealing with a massive, fast-spinning planet where gravity was much higher at the poles than at the equator.\n\n\nTo the extent that an object's internal distribution of mass differs from a symmetric model, we may use the measured surface gravity to deduce things about the object's internal structure. This fact has been put to practical use since 1915–1916, when Roland Eötvös's torsion balance was used to prospect for oil near the city of Egbell (now Gbely, Slovakia.)[12]: 1663[13]: 223 In 1924, the torsion balance was used to locate the Nash Dome oil fields in Texas.[13]: 223\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![{\\displaystyle M}](image) is \n\n\n\nκ\n=\n\n\n1\n\n4\nM\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\kappa ={\\frac {1}{4M}}}\n\n![{\\displaystyle \\kappa ={\\frac {1}{4M}}}](image) (\n\n\n\nκ\n=\n\n\nc\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n/\n\n\n4\nG\nM\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\kappa ={c^{4}}/{4GM}}\n\n![{\\displaystyle \\kappa ={c^{4}}/{4GM}}](image) in SI units).[14]\n\n\n\n### Kerr solution[edit]\n\n\nThe surface gravity for the uncharged, rotating black hole is, simply\nκ\n=\ng\n−\nk\n,\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\kappa =g-k,}\n![{\\displaystyle \\kappa =g-k,}](image)\n\nwhere \n\n\n\ng\n=\n\n\n1\n\n4\nM\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\textstyle g={\\frac {1}{4M}}}\n\n![{\\textstyle g={\\frac {1}{4M}}}](image) is the Schwarzschild surface gravity, and \n\n\n\nk\n:=\nM\n\nΩ\n\n+\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle k:=M\\Omega \\_{+}^{2}}\n\n![{\\displaystyle k:=M\\Omega _{+}^{2}}](image) is the spring constant of the rotating black hole. \n\n\n\n\nΩ\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Omega \\_{+}}\n\n![{\\displaystyle \\Omega _{+}}](image) is the angular velocity at the event horizon.

The mean apparent magnitude at superior conjunction is −1.89 while that at inferior conjunction is +5.93.[15] Observation of Mercury is complicated by its proximity to the Sun, as it is lost in the Sun's glare for much of the time. Mercury can be observed for only a brief period during either morning or evening twilight.[141]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Mercurian\". *Lexico UK English Dictionary*.

At perihelion, the equatorial subsolar point is located at latitude 0°W or 180°W, and it climbs to a temperature of about 700 K. During aphelion, this occurs at 90° or 270°W, and reaches only 550 K.[81]\nOn the dark side of the planet, temperatures average 110 K.[14][82]\nThe intensity of sunlight on Mercury's surface ranges between 4.59 and 10.61 times the solar constant (1,370 W·m−2).[83]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n184. **^** Harmon, John K.; Slade, Martin A.; Butler, Bryan J.; Head III, James W.; Rice, Melissa S.; Campbell, Donald B.

It is a terrestrial planet with a heavily cratered surface due to overlapping impact events. These features are well preserved since the planet has no geological activity and an extremely tenuous atmosphere called an exosphere. Despite being the smallest planet in the Solar System with a mean diameter of 4,880 km (3,030 mi), 38% of that of Earth, Mercury is dense enough to have roughly the same surface gravity as Mars. Mercury has a dynamic magnetic field with a strength about 1% of that of Earth's and has no natural satellites. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBecause Mercury is very close to the Sun, the intensity of sunlight on its surface is between 4.59 and 10.61 times the Sun's typical energy received by the Earth: the solar constant. Mercury orbits the Sun in a 3:2 spin–orbit resonance, meaning that relative to the background stars, it rotates on its axis exactly three times for every two revolutions it makes around the Sun.[a][21] Counterintuitively, due to Mercury's slow rotation, an observer on the planet would see only one Mercurian solar day (176 Earth days) every two Mercurian solar years (88 Earth days each).[4] Mercury's axis has the smallest tilt of any of the Solar System's planets, about 1⁄30 of a degree, and its orbital eccentricity is the largest of all known planets in the Solar System.[b]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMercury has the most eccentric orbit of all the planets in the Solar System; its eccentricity is 0.21 with its distance from the Sun ranging from 46,000,000 to 70,000,000 km (29,000,000 to 43,000,000 mi). It takes 87.969 Earth days to complete an orbit. The diagram illustrates the effects of the eccentricity, showing Mercury's orbit overlaid with a circular orbit having the same semi-major axis. Mercury's higher velocity when it is near perihelion is clear from the greater distance it covers in each 5-day interval. In the diagram, the varying distance of Mercury to the Sun is represented by the size of the planet, which is inversely proportional to Mercury's distance from the Sun. This varying distance to the Sun leads to Mercury's surface being flexed by tidal bulges raised by the Sun that are about 17 times stronger than the Moon's on Earth.[109] Combined with a 3:2 spin–orbit resonance of the planet's rotation around its axis, it also results in complex variations of the surface temperature.[28]\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_9Ttyhgb5XIjHtuZD1yjkCl4V","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
