However, the Phillies were unable to repeat the 2008 World Series victory; they were defeated in the 2009 series by the New York Yankees, four games to two. In recognition of the team's recent accomplishments, *Baseball America* named the Phillies its Organization of the Year.[43]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSince the first modern World Series was played in 1903, the Phillies have played 120 consecutive seasons and 140 seasons since the team's 1883 establishment. The Phillies were the last of the 16 pre-expansion teams to win a World Series, with their first championship coming in 1980. Since the start of the Divisional Era in 1969, however, the Phillies have emerged as one of MLB's most successful teams, winning 11 division titles (including five consecutive such titles from 2007 to 2011), eight National League pennants, and two World Series championships. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Phillies won their first pennant in 1915 thanks to the pitching of Grover Cleveland Alexander and the batting prowess of Gavvy Cravath, who set the 20th century single-season record for home runs with 24. They finished the season with a record of 90\u201362, seven games ahead of the Boston Braves. The Phillies went up against the Boston Red Sox in the World Series, opening the series at home with a victory. The Phillies struggled against a strong Red Sox pitching lineup and surrendered the next four games, losing the series four games to one. \n\n\nThe team continued to dominate the National League in 1916 but fell short of capturing a second consecutive pennant. The team finished two and a half games out of first place with a record of 91\u201362. Alexander won his second consecutive triple crown and posted 16 shutouts, tying the single-season major league record.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Major league affiliations |\n| * National League (1883\u2013present)\n\t+ East Division (1969\u2013present)\n\t+\n |\n| Current uniform |\n| ![](image) |\n| Retired numbers | ** 1\n* 14\n* 15\n* 20\n* 32\n* 34\n* 36\n* 42\n* P\n* P* |\n| Colors |\n| * Red, white, blue[1][2][3]\n |\n| Name |\n| * Philadelphia Phillies (1883\u2013present)\n* Philadelphia Blue Jays/Phillies (1944\u20131949)\n* Philadelphia Quakers/Phillies (1883\u20131889)\n |\n| Other nicknames |\n| * Phills\n* The Fightin' Phils\n* The Fightins[4][5]\n* Whiz Kids (1950)\n* Wheeze Kids (1983)\n* Macho Row (1993)\n |\n| Ballpark |\n| * Citizens Bank Park (2004\u2013present)\n* Veterans Stadium (1971\u20132003)\n* Shibe Park/Connie Mack Stadium (1938\u20131970)\n* Baker Bowl (1887\u20131938)\n* Recreation Park (1883\u20131886)\n |\n| Major league titles |\n| World Series titles (2) | * 1980\n* 2008\n |\n| NL Pennants (8) | * 1915\n* 1950\n* 1980\n* 1983\n* 1993\n* 2008\n* 2009\n* 2022\n |\n| East Division titles (11) | * 1976\n* 1977\n* 1978\n* 1980\n* 1983\n* 1993\n* 2007\n* 2008\n* 2009\n* 2010\n* 2011\n |\n| Wild card berths (2) | * 2022\n* 2023\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n15. **^** \"1883 Philadelphia Quakers\". *Baseball-Reference.com*.

The Phillies' major contributors on offense were Dykstra, Kruk, Kevin Stocker (a rookie who led the team in batting average, hitting .324), and Jim Eisenreich, all of whom hit over .300 for the season. Their pitching staff was led by 16-game winners Curt Schilling and Tommy Greene. Each member of the rotation posted at least 10 wins, while the bullpen was led by elder statesman Larry Andersen and closer Mitch \"Wild Thing\" Williams, who notched 43 saves and a 3.34 ERA.\n\n\nThey beat the Atlanta Braves in the 1993 National League Championship Series, four games to two, to earn the fifth NL pennant in franchise history, only to be defeated by the defending World Series champion Toronto Blue Jays in the 1993 World Series.[35] Toronto's Joe Carter hit a walk-off home run in Game 6 to clinch another Phillies' loss.[36]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe team's competitive futility was highlighted by a record that still stands: in 1961, the Phillies lost 23 games in a row, the worst losing streak in the majors since 1900. Things started to turn around for the team in 1962, when the team finished above .500 for the first time in five years. Gene Mauch was named National League Manager of the Year that season and won it again in 1964. The team improved in 1963, when the team finished the season with an 87\u201375 record. There was confidence that the team would soon become contenders for a return to the World Series. Though Ashburn and Roberts were gone, the 1964 Phillies still had younger pitchers Art Mahaffey, Chris Short, and rookie Ray Culp; veterans Jim Bunning and screwballer Jack Baldschun; and fan favorites Cookie Rojas, Johnny Callison, and NL Rookie of the Year Dick Allen. The team was 90\u201360 on September 20, good enough for a lead of 6.5 games in the pennant race with 12 games to play. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe 1950 Phillies led the National League standings for most of the season and were dubbed the \"Whiz Kids\". In the final months of the season, a tailspin (triggered by the loss of starting pitcher Curt Simmons to National Guard service) caused the team to lose the next eight of ten games. On the last day of the season, the Phillies hung on to a one-game lead when Dick Sisler\u2019s dramatic tenth inning home run against the Brooklyn Dodgers clinched the Phillies' first pennant in 35 years. In the World Series, exhausted from their late-season plunge and victims of poor luck, the Phillies were swept by the New York Yankees in four straight games. Nonetheless, this appearance cemented the Phillies' status as the city's favorite team.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1884, Harry Wright, the former manager of baseball's first openly professional team, the Cincinnati Red Stockings, was recruited as a manager in hopes of reversing the team's fortunes.[16]\n\n\nIn 1887, the team began to play at the newly constructed Philadelphia Base Ball Grounds, later renamed National League Park. The stadium would become known as Baker Bowl in 1923. Despite a general improvement from their dismal beginnings, they never seriously contended for the title.\n\n\n\n### Becoming the Phillies (1890\u20131917)[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 1915 World Series and City Series (Philadelphia)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n22. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Students Hint Phillies Stole Their Name\". *The Philadelphia Inquirer*.

Although the season had essentially been a two-team race between Brooklyn and St. Louis, it was still the Phillies' first appearance in the first division in 31 years. It was also a fitting tribute to Bob Carpenter Sr., who had died in June and left Bob Jr. in full control of the team.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBecause of, and in spite of, their longevity and rabid fan base, the Phillies are a team historically associated with futility. They were the first American sports franchise to amass over 10,000 losses; the team holds the world record for most ever losses by a single team in all of professional sports.[12] Yet, also due in part to their longevity, the Phillies are one of only nine teams to have won over 10,000 games in their history. Hall of Fame third baseman Mike Schmidt is widely considered the franchise's greatest player of all time.[13] Over the team's history since 1883, 33 Phillies players have been awarded entry into the Baseball Hall of Fame.\n\n\nThe Philadelphia Phillies' Triple-A affiliate is the Lehigh Valley IronPigs, who play at Coca-Cola Park in Allentown.

The team plays its home games at the Wells Fargo Center located in the South Philadelphia Sports Complex. Founded in 1946 and originally known as the **Syracuse Nationals**, they are one of the oldest franchises in the NBA and one of only eight (out of 23) to survive the league's first decade.

They made a mockery of the Eastern Conference playoffs, first sweeping the New York Knicks and then beating the Milwaukee Bucks in five games. The 76ers went on to win their third NBA championship (and second in Philadelphia) with a four-game sweep of the Los Angeles Lakers, who had defeated them the season before. Malone was named the playoffs' MVP. The 76ers did not quite fulfill Malone's prediction, as their run was actually \"fo', fi', fo\" (\"four, five, four\") \u2013 a loss to the Bucks in game four of the Eastern finals being the only blemish on their playoff run. Nonetheless, their 12\u20131 playoff record is tied for the fewest losses in league history with the 2000\u201301 Lakers, who went 15\u20131 en route to the NBA title, coincidentally beating the 76ers in the Finals (after suffering their only defeat that postseason in Game 1), and also with the 2016\u20132017 Golden State Warriors, who won the title with a 16\u20131 playoff record. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe 76ers went into the 2001\u201302 season with high expectations, but were able to produce only a 43\u201339 record, sixth in the Eastern Conference. In the first round of the playoffs, Philadelphia was defeated 3\u20132 by the Boston Celtics. In the 2002\u201303 season, the 76ers sprinted to a 15\u20134 start, but a 10\u201320 swoon left them 25\u201324 at the All-Star break. After the break, the 76ers caught fire, winning nine in a row at one point, and 23 of their last 33 to finish at 48\u201334, earning the fourth seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs. Iverson scored 55 points in the playoff opener against the New Orleans Hornets and the Sixers went on to win the series in six games. In the second round, the Detroit Pistons ended Philadelphia's playoff run in a frustrating six-game series that saw the 76ers lose twice in overtime, and once on a last-second shot in regulation. It would be nine years before the Sixers won another playoff series.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe 76ers went on to finish 56\u201326, good enough for their first Atlantic Division title since 1989\u201390 and top seed in the Eastern Conference Playoffs.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPrior to the 1998\u201399 season, the 76ers signed George Lynch and Matt Geiger, but a lockout delayed the start of the season, which was shortened to 50 games. During the season, Philadelphia acquired Tyrone Hill in a trade with Milwaukee. The team began its resurgence during this lockout-shortened season, finishing with a 28\u201322 record and the sixth seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs, marking the first time since 1991 the team reached the postseason. In the first round, Philadelphia upset the Orlando Magic 3\u20131, before being swept by the Indiana Pacers. The following season, the Sixers improved to 49\u201333, fifth in the Eastern Conference. Again, the Sixers won their first-round series in four games, this time defeating the Charlotte Hornets.

The Eagles compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the league's National Football Conference (NFC) East division. The team plays its home games at Lincoln Financial Field in the South Philadelphia Sports Complex.[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Eagles played their first game on October 15, 1933, against the New York Giants at the Polo Grounds in New York City, and lost the game 56\u20130.[16] The Eagles struggled over the course of their first decade, never winning more than four games in any of their first ten seasons. Their best finish was in 1934, the second season for the Eagles, when they tied for third in the East. The Eagles' early rosters largely consisted of former Penn, Temple, and Villanova players who played for the Eagles for a few years before going on to other things.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe franchise was established in 1933 as a replacement for the bankrupt Frankford Yellow Jackets when a group led by Bert Bell secured the rights to an NFL franchise in Philadelphia. Since their formation, the Eagles have appeared in the playoffs 29 times, won 16 division titles (including 12 in the NFC East), appeared in four pre-merger NFL Championship Games, winning three of them (1948, 1949, and 1960), and appeared in four Super Bowls, winning Super Bowl LII at the end of the 2017 season.\n\n\nAs of 2023, 13 individuals affiliated with the Eagles have been inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame: Chuck Bednarik, Bell, Bob Brown, Harold Carmichael, Brian Dawkins, Sonny Jurgensen, Greasy Neale, Tommy McDonald, Pete Pihos, Norm Van Brocklin, Steve Van Buren, Dick Vermeil, and Reggie White.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Eagles were a part of the NFL Eastern Division from 1933 to 1949, the National Conference from 1950 to 1953, and the Eastern Conference from 1953 to 1966. They were then placed in the Capitol Division of the Eastern Conference in 1967. When the league reformed into the NFC and AFC in 1970, the Eagles were placed in the NFC East. \n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Coach\n | Record\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1947 | Greasy Neale | 8\u20134\n |\n| 1948 | 11\u20135\n |\n| 1949 | 11\u20135\n |\n| 1960 | Buck Shaw | 10\u20132\n |\n| 1980 | Dick Vermeil | 12\u20134\n |\n| 1988 | Buddy Ryan | 10\u20136\n |\n| 2001 | Andy Reid | 11\u20135\n |\n| 2002 | 12\u20134\n |\n| 2003 | 12\u20134\n |\n| 2004 | 13\u20133\n |\n| 2006 | 10\u20136\n |\n| 2010 | 10\u20136\n |\n| 2013 | Chip Kelly | 10\u20136\n |\n| 2017 | Doug Pederson | 13\u20133\n |\n| 2019 | 9\u20137\n |\n| 2022 | Nick Sirianni | 14\u20133\n |\n| **Total Division Championships won: 16** |\n\n\n## Logo and uniforms[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Protective equipment in gridiron football and National Football League uniform numbers\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 1958, the Eagles took several steps to improve, hiring Buck Shaw as head coach and acquiring quarterback Norm Van Brocklin in a trade with the Los Angeles Rams. During the 1959 season, the team showed flashes of talent, and finished in second place in the Eastern Division. Former Eagles owner and co-founder Bert Bell had become NFL commissioner, and attended the Eagles game on October 11 at Franklin Field against the Pittsburgh Steelers, a team Bell used to own. Bell refused the box seats that the Eagles reserved for him and purchased his own tickets to sit with the fans. During the fourth quarter, while sitting behind the end zone, Bell suffered a heart attack and died later that day.\n\n\n\n##### NFL champions (1960)[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: 1960 NFL Championship Game, Philadelphia Eagles Santa Claus incident, and The Hit (Chuck Bednarik)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 1943, with player shortages stemming from the U.S. entry engagement in World War II, it became difficult to fill the roster, and the team merged with the Steelers to form the \"Phil-Pitt Eagles\", known as the Steagles. Greasy Neale continued to coach the team along with Steelers head coach Walt Kiesling. The team finished the 1943 season with a 5\u20134\u20131 record, and the merger, which was never intended to be a permanent arrangement, was dissolved at the season's end.\n\n\nIn 1944, the Eagles, led by head coach Greasy Neale and running back Steve Van Buren, had their first winning season in team history. After two second-place finishes in 1945 and 1946, the team reached the NFL Championship game for the first time in 1947. Van Buren, Pete Pihos, and Bosh Pritchard fought valiantly, but the young team lost to the Chicago Cardinals, 28\u201321 at Comiskey Park in Chicago.\n\n\n\n##### NFL champions (1948)[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: 1948 NFL Championship Game and 1948 Philadelphia Eagles season\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMain article: History of the Philadelphia Eagles\n\n### NFL in Philadelphia (1899\u20131931)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Philadelphia Yellow Jackets\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Eastern Division (1933\u20131949)\n* American Conference (1950\u20131952)\n* Eastern Conference (1953\u20131969)\n\t+ Capitol Division (1967\u20131969)\n* **National Football Conference (1970\u2013present)**\n\t+ **NFC East (1970\u2013present)**\n |\n| **Current uniform**\n |\n| ![](image)\n |\n| Team colors | Midnight green, silver, black, white[3][4][5]\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 |\n| Fight song | \"Fly, Eagles Fly\" |\n| Mascot | Swoop |\n| Personnel |\n| Owner(s) | Jeffrey Lurie[6] |\n| CEO | Jeffrey Lurie |\n| President | Don Smolenski |\n| General manager | Howie Roseman |\n| Head coach | Nick Sirianni |\n| Team history |\n| * **Philadelphia Eagles (1933\u20131942, 1944\u2013present)**\n* Phil-Pitt \"Steagles\" (1943)\n |\n| Team nicknames |\n| * **The Birds**\n* **The Iggles**\n |\n| Championships |\n| **League championships (4)*** **NFL championships (pre-1970 AFL\u2013NFL merger) (3)**1948, 1949, 1960\n* **Super Bowl championships (1)**2017\u00a0(LII)\n |\n| **Conference championships (5)*** **NFL Eastern:** 1960\n* **NFC:** 1980, 2004, 2017, 2022\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe team's intense rivalry with the New York Giants has been ranked the top rivalry of all time by NFL Network, the fourth-best NFL rivalry by *Sports Illustrated*,[8] and one of the fiercest and best-known football rivalries by ESPN.[9] The Eagles' bitter rivalry with the Dallas Cowboys has become more high-profile and intense since the 1960s, and the team has a historic rivalry with the Washington Commanders. Their rivalry with the Pittsburgh Steelers dates back to 1933 and is known as the \"Battle of Pennsylvania\".[10]\n\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles rank among the best teams in the NFL for attendance and have sold out every home game continuously since the 1999 season.[11][12]\n\n\nThe Eagles are owned by Jeffrey Lurie, who bought the team from previous owner Norman Braman for $195 million on May 6, 1994. As of 2023, the Eagles franchise value has increased to $4.9 billion, according to *Forbes*, making them the 10th-most valuable team in the NFL.[13]\n\n\n\n\n## Franchise history[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nPhiladelphia Eagles\n |\n| --- |\n| * Founded in 1933\n* Based and headquartered in **Philadelphia, Pennsylvania**\n |\n| Franchise | * Franchise\n* History\n* Seasons\n* Coaches\n* Quarterbacks\n* Players\n* Draft\n |\n| Stadiums | * Baker Bowl\n* Philadelphia Municipal Stadium\n* Connie Mack Stadium\n* Franklin Field\n* Veterans Stadium\n* **Lincoln Financial Field**\n |\n| Culture | * \"Fly, Eagles Fly\"\n* Swoop\n* Curse of Billy Penn\n* *Invincible*\n* Philadelphia Sports Hall of Fame\n* Matt Guokas Sr.\n* Dan Baker\n* Cheerleaders\n* Dom DiSandro\n* *Silver Linings Playbook*\n* *The Garbage Picking Field Goal Kicking Philadelphia Phenomenon*\n* Pattison station\n* South Philadelphia Sports Complex\n* *Boy Meets World*\n* *It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia*\n* \"No one likes us, we don't care\"\n* *A Philly Special Christmas*\n* *A Philly Special Christmas Special*\n |\n| Lore | * Frankford Yellow Jackets\n* Pennsylvania Keystoners\n* \"Pennsylvania Polka\"\n* Steagles\n* \"Happy Hundred\"\n* Chuck Bednarik's hit on Frank Gifford\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Franklin Field, the Eagles' home field from 1958 to 1970\nThe Eagles' 1960 season remains one of the most celebrated year in team history. Shaw, Van Brocklin, and Bednarik, each in their last season before retirement, led an Eagles team more notable for its grit than its talent. One observer later quipped that the team had \"nothing but a championship\" to its first division title since 1949. The team was aided by their two Pro Bowl receivers, wide receiver Tommy McDonald, who later wrote an autobiography titled *They Pay Me to Catch Footballs*, and tight end Pete Retzlaff.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the opening game of the 2003 season, the Eagles were shut out 17\u20130 by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the first regular-season game ever played at their new home, Lincoln Financial Field. Once again, the team went 12\u20134 for the season and then reached the conference championship game. In doing so, the Eagles became the first team in modern history to get that far in the postseason after having been shut out at home in its first game. They achieved that distinction despite getting only five touchdown receptions all year by their wide receivers, which tied the league-low since the regular-season schedule was lengthened to its present 16 games in 1978 (this record would be broken in 2004 when the New York Giants' wide receivers caught only two touchdown passes). The Eagle receivers went through both September and October without a TD catch; the last time an NFL team had done that was in 1945. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n28. **^** Didinger, Ray; Robert S.

His rookie quarterback started with five touchdowns, no interceptions and over 255 yards per game. After a Week 4 bye, they lost four out of the next five games, including losses to every team in their division. They also lost right tackle Lane Johnson to a 10-game suspension following the Week 5 loss against the Lions, which damaged Carson Wentz's hot start. In those four defeats, their average margin of loss was just under 5 points.[82] Pederson and the Eagles won just three of their final seven games. Although Wentz started off the season well, he finished with a TD\u2013INT ratio of 8:7.

The club, garbed in orange and black like today's Flyers, was coached by J. Cooper Smeaton, who was to be elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame 30 years later, for his far more notable role as an NHL referee. Among the young Quakers' skaters in 1930\u201331 was another future Hall of Famer in 19-year-old rookie center Syd Howe. The Quakers' only \"claim to fame\" was to establish a single season NHL record for futility which has stood ever since, by compiling a dismal record of 4\u201336\u20134, still the fewest games ever won in a season by an NHL club. The Quakers quietly suspended operations after that single dreadful campaign to again leave the Can-Am League's Philadelphia Arrows as Philadelphia's lone hockey team. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n70. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** ***k*** ***l*** ***m*** ***n*** ***o*** ***p*** ***q*** \"Flyers History \u2013 Flyers Jersey History Gallery\".

In the 1972\u201373 season the Flyers got rid of the mediocre expansion team label and instead became the intimidating \"Broad Street Bullies\", a nickname coined by Jack Chevalier and Pete Cafone of the *Philadelphia Bulletin* on January 3, 1973,[24] after a 3\u20131 brawling victory over the Atlanta Flames that led Chevalier to write in his game account, \"The image of the fightin' Flyers spreading gradually around the NHL, and people are dreaming up wild nicknames. They're the Mean Machine, the Bullies of Broad Street and Freddy's Philistines.\" Cafone wrote the accompanying headline: \"Broad Street Bullies Muscle Atlanta.\"[25] That same month, Clarke was the youngest player (at that time) in NHL history to be named team captain, replacing Ed Van Impe. Rick MacLeish became the first Flyer to score 50 goals in a season and the Flyers recorded their first winning season.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Flyers began the 1979\u201380 season with a somewhat controversial move by naming Clarke a playing assistant coach and giving the captaincy to Mel Bridgman. While Clarke was against this initially, he accepted his new role. The Flyers went undefeated for a North American professional sports record 35-straight games (25\u20130\u201310), before losing 7\u20131 to the Minnesota North Stars, a record that still stands to this day.[28] The streak started after the team was 1\u20131 on October 14, and ended on January 7, 1980.[29] In doing so, the Flyers wrapped up the Patrick Division title with 14 games to spare and the first overall seed in the playoffs. Their regular season success continued into the playoffs, as the Flyers swept a young Wayne Gretzky and his Edmonton Oilers in the first round, then went on to get revenge against Fred \"The Fog\" Shero and his Rangers by beating them in five before disposing of Minnesota in five to lock up a berth in the Stanley Cup Finals. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Bobby Clarke and Bernie Parent, 1988\n* Keith Allen, Bill Barber and Ed Snider, 1989\n* Rick MacLeish and Fred Shero, 1990\n* Barry Ashbee and Gary Dornhoefer, 1991\n* Gene Hart and Reggie Leach, 1992\n* Joe Scott and Ed Van Impe, 1993\n* Tim Kerr, 1994\n* Joe Watson, 1996\n* Brian Propp, 1999\n* Mark Howe, 2001\n* Dave Poulin, 2004\n* Ron Hextall, 2008\n* Dave Schultz, 2009\n* John LeClair and Eric Lindros, 2014\n* Eric Desjardins and Rod Brind'Amour, 2015\n* Jimmy Watson, 2016\n* Rick Tocchet and Paul Holmgren, 2021\n\n## Team records[edit]\n\n\nStatistics and records are current after the **2021\u201322 season**, except where noted.\n\n\n\n### Season-by-season record[edit]\n\n\n*This is a partial list of the last five seasons completed by the Flyers.

The Flyers have had rivalries with several teams over the years. Historically, their biggest adversaries have been the New York Rangers, with an intense rivalry stretching back to the 1970s. They have also waged lengthy campaigns against the New York Islanders in the 1970s and 1980s, the Boston Bruins in the 1970s and 2010s, the Washington Capitals, since their days in the Patrick Division,[5][6] as well as the New Jersey Devils, with whom they traded the Atlantic Division title every season between 1994\u201395 and 2006\u201307, and with their cross-state rivals, the Pittsburgh Penguins, which is considered by many to be the best rivalry in the league.[7][8][9]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### NHL in Philadelphia before 1967[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Flyers began the 2015\u201316 season with a record of 4\u20132\u20131 in their first seven games. They found themselves outside of the playoff picture near the halfway point of the regular season, but a second-half surge, including a combined record of 17\u20137\u20135 in February and March, placed them into playoff position. On the second-to-last day of the season, the Flyers clinched the final wild-card playoff berth with a win over Pittsburgh and an Ottawa win over Boston, which consequently eliminated the Bruins from playoff contention. The Flyers faced Washington in the first round, losing the first three games of the series. The Flyers would rally to win the next two games, but lost the series in six games.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Flyers said goodbye to the Spectrum and prepared to open a new arena \u2013 the CoreStates Center \u2013 for the next season. The 1996\u201397 season started off slowly, as Lindros missed 30 games, but LeClair still managed to score 50 goals for the second consecutive year, while the mid-season acquisition of defenseman Paul Coffey gave the Flyers a veteran presence.[32] Despite finishing just one point shy of a third straight Atlantic Division title, the Flyers blitzed their way through the first three rounds of the playoffs, dominating Pittsburgh, Buffalo and the Rangers all in five games apiece to win the Eastern Conference championship, and clinch a berth in the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time since 1986\u201387. Despite having home-ice advantage, the Flyers were swept in four-straight games by the Detroit Red Wings. The goaltending tandem of Hextall and Garth Snow fared poorly in the Finals, as both conceded soft goals, and Murray's strategy of alternating starters in goal was criticized. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n44. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Flyers relieve Ron Hextall\".
