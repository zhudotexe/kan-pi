Honduras's manufacturing sector has not yet developed beyond simple textile and agricultural processing industries and assembly operations. The small domestic market and competition from more industrially advanced countries in the region have inhibited more complex industrialization.\n\n\n\nIn 2022, according to the National Institute of Statistics of Honduras (INE), 73% of the country's population is poor and 53% lives in extreme poverty.[80] The country is one of the most unequal in Latin America.[81]\n![](image)Historical GDP per capita development of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras\n### Poverty[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Honduran people are among the poorest in Latin America; gross national income per capita (2007) is US$1,649; the average for Central America is $6,736.[79]\nHonduras is the fourth poorest country in the Western Hemisphere; only Haiti, Nicaragua, and Guyana are poorer.

The country's leading export is coffee (US$340\u00a0million), which accounted for 22% of the total Honduran export revenues. Bananas, formerly the country's second-largest export until being virtually wiped out by 1998's Hurricane Mitch, recovered in 2000 to 57% of pre-Mitch levels. Cultivated shrimp is another important export sector. Since the late 1970s, towns in the north began industrial production through maquiladoras, especially in San Pedro Sula and Puerto Cort\u00e9s.[78]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHonduras had a population of 10,278,345 in 2021.[14][15] The proportion of the population below the age of 15 in 2010 was 36.8%, 58.9% were between 15 and 65 years old, and 4.3% were 65 years old or older.[105]\n\n\nSince 1975, emigration from Honduras has accelerated as economic migrants and political refugees sought a better life elsewhere. A majority of expatriate Hondurans live in the United States. A 2012 US State Department estimate suggested that between 800,000 and one million Hondurans lived in the United States at that time, nearly 15% of the Honduran population.[43] The large uncertainty about numbers is because numerous Hondurans live in the United States without a visa. In the 2010 census in the United States, 617,392 residents identified as Hondurans, up from 217,569 in 2000.[106]\n\n\n\n### Race and ethnicity[edit]\n\n\nEthnic groups in Honduras\u00a0%[107]\n\n\n\nMestizo (mixed Amerindian and European) (90%)\nAmerindians (7%)\nBlacks (2%)\nWhites (1%)\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
