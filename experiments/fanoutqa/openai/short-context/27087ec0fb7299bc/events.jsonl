In the special case of just two people, where one has no income, and the other has all the income, the Gini coefficient is 0.5. For five people, where four have no income, and the fifth has all the income, the Gini coefficient is 0.8.

If household data is used, the measured value of income Gini depends on how the household is defined. The comparison is not meaningful when different populations are not measured with consistent definitions.\n\n\nDeininger and Squire (1996) show that the income Gini coefficient based on individual income rather than household income is different. For example, for the United States, they found that the individual income-based Gini index was 0.35, while for France, 0.43. According to their individual-focused method, in the 108 countries they studied, South Africa had the world's highest Gini coefficient at 0.62, Malaysia had Asia's highest Gini coefficient at 0.5, Brazil the highest at 0.57 in Latin America and the Caribbean region, and Turkey the highest at 0.5 in OECD countries.[81]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSmall sample bias – sparsely populated regions more likely to have low Gini coefficient\nGini index has a downward-bias for small populations.[79] Counties or states or countries with small populations and less diverse economies will tend to report small Gini coefficients. For economically diverse large population groups, a much higher coefficient is expected than for each of its regions. For example, taking the world economy as a whole and income distribution for all human beings, different scholars estimate the global Gini index to range between 0.61 and 0.68.[12][13]\nAs with other inequality coefficients, the Gini coefficient is influenced by the granularity of the measurements. For example, five 20% quantiles (low granularity) will usually yield a lower Gini coefficient than twenty 5% quantiles (high granularity) for the same distribution. Philippe Monfort has shown that using inconsistent or unspecified granularity limits the usefulness of Gini coefficient measurements.[80]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![The change in Gini indices has differed across countries. Some countries have change little over time, such as Belgium, Canada, Germany, Japan, and Sweden. Brazil has oscillated around a steady value. France, Italy, Mexico, and Norway have shown marked declines. China and the US have increased steadily. Australia grew to moderate levels before dropping. India sank before rising again. The UK and Poland stayed at very low levels before rising. Bulgaria had an increase of fits-and-starts. .svg alt text](image)\n### Regional income Gini indices[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nUsing the Gini can help quantify differences in welfare and compensation policies and philosophies. However, it should be borne in mind that the Gini coefficient can be misleading when used to make political comparisons between large and small countries or those with different immigration policies (see limitations section).\n\n\nThe Gini coefficient for the entire world has been estimated by various parties to be between 0.61 and 0.68.[12][13][51] The graph shows the values expressed as a percentage in their historical development for a number of countries.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Gini coefficient was proposed by Corrado Gini as a measure of inequality of income or wealth.[6] For OECD countries in the late 20th century, considering the effect of taxes and transfer payments, the income Gini coefficient ranged between 0.24 and 0.49, with Slovenia being the lowest and Mexico the highest.[7] African countries had the highest pre-tax Gini coefficients in 2008–2009, with South Africa having the world's highest, estimated to be 0.63 to 0.7.[8][9] However, this figure drops to 0.52 after social assistance is taken into account, and drops again to 0.47 after taxation.[10] The country with the lowest Gini coefficient is Slovenia, with a Gini coefficient of 0.232.[11] The Gini coefficient of the global income in 2005 has been estimated to be between 0.61 and 0.68 by various sources.[12][13]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn economics, the **Gini coefficient** (/ˈdʒiːni/ *JEE-nee*), also known as the **Gini index** or **Gini ratio**, is a measure of statistical dispersion intended to represent the income inequality, the wealth inequality, or the consumption inequality[3] within a nation or a social group. It was developed by Italian statistician and sociologist Corrado Gini.\n\n\nThe Gini coefficient measures the inequality among the values of a frequency distribution, such as levels of income. A Gini coefficient of 0 reflects perfect equality, where all income or wealth values are the same, while a Gini coefficient of 1 (or 100%) reflects maximal inequality among values, a situation where a single individual has all the income while all others have none.[4][5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nEducation Gini index estimates the inequality in education for a given population.[59] It is used to discern trends in social development through educational attainment over time. A study across 85 countries by three World Bank economists, Vinod Thomas, Yan Wang, and Xibo Fan, estimated Mali had the highest education Gini index of 0.92 in 1990 (implying very high inequality in educational attainment across the population), while the United States had the lowest education inequality Gini index of 0.14. Between 1960 and 1990, China, India and South Korea had the fastest drop in education inequality Gini Index. They also claim education Gini index for the United States slightly increased over the 1980–1990 period.\n\n\n  \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Dorfman, Robert (1979). \"A Formula for the Gini Coefficient\". *The Review of Economics and Statistics*. **61** (1): 146–149. doi:10.2307/1924845.
