In 1929, before the Great Depression, the world had 32,028,500 automobiles in use, of which more than 90% produced by the U.S. automobile industry. At that time, the U.S. had one car per 4.87 persons.[5] After 1945, the U.S. produced around three quarters of world's auto production. In 1980, the U.S. was overtaken by Japan and then became a world leader again in 1994. Japan narrowly passed the U.S. in production the years 2006 and 2007, and in 2008 also China, which in 2009 took the top spot (from Japan) with 13.8 million units, although the U.S. surpassed Japan in 2011, to become the second-largest automobile industry. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Volvo Group and Eicher Motors have a 50-50% joint venture called VE Commercial Vehicles.\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers\n* Automotive industry by country\n* Automotive industry crisis of 2008\u20132010\n* Automotive industry in the United States\n* Big Three (automobile manufacturers)\n* Effects of the 2008\u201310 automotive industry crisis on the United States\n* List of countries by motor vehicle production\n* Motocycle\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** As of 2017\n2. **^** OICA lists SAIC-GM-Wuling combined with G.M. until 2014 but separately from 2015.

It has been in continuous family control for over 100 years and is one of the largest family-controlled companies in the world.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe first gasoline-powered automobile had been created in 1885 by the German inventor Karl Benz (Benz Patent-Motorwagen). More efficient production methods were needed to make automobiles affordable for the middle class, to which Ford contributed by, for instance, introducing the first moving assembly line in 1913 at the Ford factory in Highland Park.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFord formed its first passenger-vehicle joint venture in China in 2001, six years behind GM and more than a decade after VW. It has spent as of 2013[update] $4.9 billion to expand its lineup and double production capacity in China to 600,000 vehicles. This includes Ford's largest-ever factory complex in the southwestern city of Chongqing. Ford had 2.5% of the Chinese market in 2013, while VW controlled 14.5% and GM had 15.6%, according to consultant LMC Automotive. GM outsells Ford in China by more than six-to-one.[108] Ford's presence in Asia has traditionally been much smaller, confined to Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong, the Philippines, and Taiwan, where Ford has had a joint venture with Lio Ho since the 1970s. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n254. **^** \"Ford Motor Company 2007 sales\" (Press release).
