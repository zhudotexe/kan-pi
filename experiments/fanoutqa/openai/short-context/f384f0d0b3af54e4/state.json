          "content": "<document>\n<title>Moon</title>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Moon is in geophysical terms a planetary-mass object or satellite planet. It has a mass that amounts to 1.2% of Earth's, and a diameter that is roughly one-quarter of Earth's or with 3,474\u00a0km (2,159\u00a0mi) about as wide as Australia.[17] Within the Solar System it is the most massive and largest satellite in relation to its parent planet, the fifth most massive and largest moon overall, and more massive and larger than all known dwarf planets.[18] Its surface gravity is about one sixth of Earth's, about half of that of Mars, and after Jupiter's moon Io the second highest among all Solar System moons. The body of the Moon is differentiated and terrestrial, with no significant hydrosphere, atmosphere, or magnetic field. It formed 4.51\u00a0billion years ago, not long after Earth's formation, out of the debris from a giant impact between Earth and a hypothesized Mars-sized body called Theia.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Moon's diameter is about 3,500\u00a0km, more than a quarter of Earth's, with the face of the Moon comparable to the width of either Australia,[17] Europe or the US without Alaska.[69] The whole surface area of the Moon is about 38 million square kilometers, between the size of the Americas (North and South America) and Africa.\n\n\nThe Moon's mass is 1/81 of Earth's,[70] being the second densest among the planetary moons, and having the second highest surface gravity, after Io, at 0.1654\u00a0g and an escape velocity of 2.38\u00a0km/s (8600\u00a0km/h; 5300\u00a0mph).\n\n\n\n### Structure[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Internal structure of the Moon and Geology of the Moon\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Size comparison of the main moons of the Solar System with Earth to scale. Nineteen moons are large enough to be round, several having subsurface oceans and one, Titan, having a considerable atmosphere.\nThe Moon is by size and mass the fifth largest natural satellite of the Solar System, categorizeable as one of its planetary-mass moons, making it a satellite planet under the geophysical definitions of the term.[18] It is smaller than Mercury and considerably larger than the largest dwarf planet of the Solar System, Pluto. While the minor-planet moon Charon of the Pluto-Charon system is larger relative to Pluto,[f][68] the Moon is the largest natural satellite of the Solar System relative to their primary planets.[g]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n3. **^** The *maximum value* is given based on scaling of the brightness from the value of \u221212.74 given for an equator to Moon-centre distance of 378\u00a0000\u00a0km in the NASA factsheet reference to the minimum Earth\u2013Moon distance given there, after the latter is corrected for Earth's equatorial radius of 6\u00a0378\u00a0km, giving 350\u00a0600\u00a0km. The *minimum value* (for a distant new moon) is based on a similar scaling using the maximum Earth\u2013Moon distance of 407\u00a0000\u00a0km (given in the factsheet) and by calculating the brightness of the earthshine onto such a new moon. The brightness of the earthshine is [ Earth albedo \u00d7 (Earth radius / Radius of Moon's orbit)2\u00a0] relative to the direct solar illumination that occurs for a full moon. (Earth albedo = 0.367; Earth radius = (polar radius\u00a0\u00d7 equatorial radius)\u00bd = 6 367 km.)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe **Moon** is Earth's only natural satellite. It orbits at an average distance of 384400\u00a0km (238900\u00a0mi), about 30 times the planet's diameter. The Moon always presents the same side to Earth, because gravitational pull has locked its rotation to the planet. This results in the lunar day of 29.5 days matching the lunar month. The Moon's gravitational pull\u00a0\u2013 and to a lesser extent the Sun's\u00a0\u2013 are the main drivers of the tides.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n16. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Lucey, Paul; Korotev, Randy L.; Gillis, Jeffrey J.; Taylor, Larry A.; Lawrence, David; Campbell, Bruce A.; Elphic, Rick; Feldman, Bill; Hood, Lon L.; Hunten, Donald; Mendillo, Michael; Noble, Sarah; Papike, James J.; Reedy, Robert C.; Lawson, Stefanie; Prettyman, Tom; Gasnault, Olivier; Maurice, Sylvestre (2006). \"Understanding the lunar surface and space-Moon interactions\". *Reviews in Mineralogy and Geochemistry*. **60** (1): 83\u2013219.

This barycenter is 1,700\u00a0km (1,100\u00a0mi) (about a quarter of Earth's radius) beneath the Earth's surface.\n\n\nThe Moon's orbit is slightly elliptical, with an orbital eccentricity of 0.055.[1]\nThe semi-major axis of the geocentric lunar orbit, called the Lunar distance, is approximately 400,000\u00a0km (250,000 miles or 1.28 light-seconds), comparable to going around Earth 9.5 times.[166]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n6. **^** With 27% the diameter and 60% the density of Earth, the Moon has 1.23% of the mass of Earth. The moon Charon is larger relative to its primary Pluto, but Earth and the Moon are different since Pluto is considered a dwarf planet and not a planet, unlike Earth.\n7. **^** There is no strong correlation between the sizes of planets and the sizes of their satellites. Larger planets tend to have more satellites, both large and small, than smaller planets.\n8. **^** More accurately, the Moon's mean sidereal period (fixed star to fixed star) is 27.321661\u00a0days (27 d 07 h 43 min 11.5 s), and its mean tropical orbital period (from equinox to equinox) is 27.321582\u00a0days (27 d 07 h 43 min 04.7 s) (*Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Ephemeris*, 1961, at p.107).\n9. **^** More accurately, the Moon's mean synodic period (between mean solar conjunctions) is 29.530589\u00a0days (29 d 12 h 44 min 02.9 s) (*Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Ephemeris*, 1961, at p.107).\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Moon is a very slightly scalene ellipsoid due to tidal stretching, with its long axis displaced 30\u00b0 from facing the Earth, due to gravitational anomalies from impact basins. Its shape is more elongated than current tidal forces can account for. This 'fossil bulge' indicates that the Moon solidified when it orbited at half its current distance to the Earth, and that it is now too cold for its shape to restore hydrostatic equilibrium at its current orbital distance.[67]\n\n\n\n### Size and mass[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of natural satellites\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nNatural satellites of the Solar System\n |\n| --- |\n| Planetarysatellites of | * Earth\n* Mars\n* Jupiter\n* Saturn\n* Uranus\n* Neptune\n | ![](image)![](image)![](image)\n |\n| Dwarf planetsatellites of | * Orcus\n* Pluto\n* Haumea\n* Quaoar\n* Makemake\n* Gonggong\n* Eris\n |\n| Minor-planetmoons | Near-Earth\nFlorence\nDidymos\nDimorphos\nMoshup\nSquannit\n1994 CC\n2001 SN263\nMain belt\nKalliope\nLinus\nEuphrosyne\nDaphne\nPeneius\nEugenia\nPetit-Prince\nSylvia\nRomulus\nRemus\nMinerva\nAegis\nGorgoneion\nCamilla\nElektra\nKleopatra\nAlexhelios\nCleoselene\nIda\nDactyl\nRoxane\nOlympias\nPulcova\nBalam\nDinkinesh (Selam)\nJupiter trojans\nPatroclus\nMenoetius\nHektor\nSkamandrios\nEurybates\nQueta\nTNOs\nLempo\nHiisi\nPaha\n2002 UX25\nSila\u2013Nunam\nSalacia\nActaea\nVarda\nIlmar\u00eb\nG\u01c3k\u00fan\u01c1\u02bch\u00f2md\u00edm\u00e0\nG\u01c3\u00f2\u02bc\u00e9 \u01c3H\u00fa\n2013 FY27\n |\n| Rankedby size | * Ganymede\n\t+ **largest**: 5268 km / 0.413 Earths\n* Titan\n* Callisto\n* Io\n* Moon\n* Europa\n* Triton\n* Titania\n* Rhea\n* Oberon\n* Iapetus\n* Charon\n* Umbriel\n* Ariel\n* Dione\n* Tethys\n* Dysnomia\n* Enceladus\n* Miranda\n* Vanth\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Moon has been also a site of Earth observation, particularly culturally as in the photograph called *Earthrise*.

It has an angular diameter of between 8' (rising) and 12' (overhead). Due to its close orbit, it would look smaller when the observer is further away from the Martian equator and is below the horizon and thus not visible from Mars's polar ice caps. Deimos looks more like a bright star or planet for an observer on Mars, only slightly bigger than Venus looks from Earth; it has an angular diameter of about 2'. The Sun's angular diameter as seen from Mars, by contrast, is about 21'. Thus there are no total solar eclipses on Mars, as the moons are far too small to completely cover the Sun. On the other hand, total lunar eclipses of Phobos happen almost every night.[25]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Label  [note 1] | Name and pronunciation\n | Image\n | Diameter (km)\n | Surfacearea (km2)\n | Mass (kg)\n | Semi-majoraxis (km)\n | Orbitalperiod (h)\n | Average moonriseperiod (h, d)\n | Eccentricity\n | Inclination (\u00b0)[note 2] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| I\n | Phobos | /\u02c8fo\u028ab\u0259s/*FOH-b\u0259s* | ![](image) | 22.2\u00a0km (13.8\u00a0mi)(27\u00d721.6\u00d718.8\u00a0km)\n | 1,548\u00a0km2 | 10.7\u00d71015 | 9,377\u00a0km (5,827\u00a0mi)\n | 7.66\n | 11.12 h (0.463 d)\n | 0.0151\n | 1.093\n |\n| II\n | Deimos | /\u02c8da\u026am\u0259s/*DY-m\u0259ss* | ![](image) | 12.6\u00a0km (7.8\u00a0mi)(10\u00d712\u00d716\u00a0km)\n | 483\u00a0km2 | 1.5\u00d71015 | 23,460\u00a0km (14,580\u00a0mi)\n | 30.31\n | 131 h (5.44 d)\n | 0.00033\n | 0.93\n |\n| ![](image)The relative sizes of and distance between Mars, Phobos, and Deimos, to scale\n*(Load the image in full size to see both Moons of Mars.)*\n |\n\n\n## Origin[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNatural satellites orbiting Mars\n\n\n\n\n\n![](image)\nEnhanced color image of Phobos (MRO, 23 March 2008)\n![](image)\nEnhanced color image of Deimos (MRO, 21 February 2009)\n\nThe **two moons of Mars** are Phobos and Deimos.[1] They are irregular in shape.[2] Both were discovered by American astronomer Asaph Hall in August 1877[3] and are named after the Greek mythological twin characters Phobos (fear and panic) and Deimos (terror and dread) who accompanied their father Ares into battle. Ares, the god of war, was known to the Romans as Mars.\n\n\nCompared to the Earth's Moon, the moons Phobos and Deimos are small. Phobos has a diameter of 22.2\u00a0km (13.8\u00a0mi) and a mass of 1.08\u00d71016 kg, while Deimos measures 12.6\u00a0km (7.8\u00a0mi) across, with a mass of 2.0\u00d71015 kg. Phobos orbits closer to Mars, with a semi-major axis of 9,377\u00a0km (5,827\u00a0mi) and an orbital period of 7.66 hours; while Deimos orbits farther with a semi-major axis of 23,460\u00a0km (14,580\u00a0mi) and an orbital period of 30.35 hours.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n6. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Close Inspection for Phobos\".

The inner part of the ring formed a large moon. Gravitational interactions between this moon and the outer ring formed Phobos and Deimos. Later, the large moon crashed into Mars, but the two small moons remained in orbit. This theory agrees with the fine-grained surface of the moons and their high porosity. The outer disk would create fine-grained material.[40][41] Simulations suggest the object colliding with Mars had to be within the size range of Ceres and Vesta because a larger impact would have created a more massive disc and moons that would have prevented the survival of tiny moons like Phobos and Deimos.[42]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n59. **^** Ainsworth, Diane (11 September 1998). \"Martian moon Phobos hip-deep in powder\". *JPL*.

Among them is Ganymede, the largest and most massive moon in the Solar System. Its 87 known irregular moons are organized into two categories: prograde and retrograde. The prograde satellites consist of the Himalia group and three others in groups of one. The retrograde moons are grouped into the Carme, Ananke and Pasiphae groups.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThis is a list of the recognized moons of the planets and of the largest potential dwarf planets of the Solar System, ordered by their official Roman numeral designations.

It orbits Mars much faster than Mars rotates and completes an orbit in just 7 hours and 39 minutes.[10] As a result, from the surface of Mars it appears to rise in the west, move across the sky in 4 hours and 15 minutes or less, and set in the east, twice each Martian day.\n\n\nPhobos is one of the least reflective bodies in the Solar System, with an albedo of 0.071.

The next planned mission to the Jovian system is the European Space Agency's Jupiter Icy Moon Explorer (JUICE), which was launched in 2023.[27] After flybys of all three icy Galilean moons, it is planned to enter orbit around Ganymede.[28]\n\n\n\n![](image)Size comparison of Earth, the Moon (top left), and Ganymede (bottom left)\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe *New Horizons* spacecraft also observed Ganymede, but from a much larger distance as it passed through the Jupiter system in 2007 (en route to Pluto). The data were used to perform topographic and compositional mapping of Ganymede.[113][114]\n\n\nLike *Galileo*, the *Juno* spacecraft orbited Jupiter. On 2019 December 25, *Juno* performed a distant flyby of Ganymede during its 24th orbit of Jupiter, at a range of 97,680 to 109,439 kilometers (60,696 to 68,002\u00a0mi). This flyby provided images of the moon's polar regions.[115][116] In June 2021, *Juno* performed a second flyby, at a closer distance of 1,038 kilometers (645\u00a0mi).[106][117] This encounter was designed to provide a gravity assist to reduce *Juno'*s orbital period from 53 days to 43 days. Additional images of the surface were collected.[106]\n\n\n\n### Future missions[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nChinese astronomical records report that in 365 BC, Gan De detected what might have been a moon of Jupiter, probably Ganymede, with the naked eye.[29] However, Gan De reported the color of the companion as reddish, which is puzzling since moons are too faint for their color to be perceived with the naked eye.[30] Shi Shen and Gan De together made fairly accurate observations of the five major planets.[31][32]\n\n\nOn January 7, 1610, Galileo Galilei used a telescope to observe what he thought were three stars near Jupiter, including what turned out to be Ganymede, Callisto, and one body that turned out to be the combined light from Io and Europa; the next night he noticed that they had moved. On January 13, he saw all four at once for the first time, but had seen each of the moons before this date at least once. By January 15, Galileo came to the conclusion that the stars were actually bodies orbiting Jupiter.[1][2][g]\n\n\n\n## Name[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nGanymede| ![Photograph of Ganymede](image)Ganymede photographed by *Juno* in 2021\n |\n| Discovery[1][2] |\n| Discovered\u00a0by | Galileo GalileiSimon Marius |\n| Discovery\u00a0date | January 7, 1610 |\n| Designations |\n| Pronunciation | /\u02c8\u0261\u00e6n\u0259\u02ccmi\u02d0d/[3]*GAN-\u0259-MEED* |\n| Named after\n | \u0393\u03b1\u03bd\u03c5\u03bc\u03ae\u03b4\u03b7\u03c2, *Ganym\u0113d\u0113s* |\n| Alternative names\n | Jupiter III |\n| Adjectives | Ganymedian,[4]Ganymedean[5][6] (/\u02cc\u0261\u00e6n\u0259\u02c8mi\u02d0di.\u0259n/) |\n| Orbital characteristics |\n| Periapsis | 1069200\u00a0km[a] |\n| Apoapsis | 1071600\u00a0km[b] |\n| Semi-major axis\n | 1070400\u00a0km[7] |\n| Eccentricity | 0.0013[7] |\n| Orbital period (sidereal)\n | 7.15455296\u00a0d[7] |\n| Average orbital speed\n | 10.880\u00a0km/s |\n| Inclination | 2.214\u00b0 (to the ecliptic)0.20\u00b0 (to Jupiter's equator)[7] |\n| Satellite\u00a0of | Jupiter |\n| Group | Galilean moon |\n| Physical characteristics |\n| Mean radius\n | 2634.1\u00b10.3\u00a0km (0.413 Earths)[8] |\n| Surface area\n | 8.72\u00d7107\u00a0km2 (0.171 Earths)[c] |\n| Volume | 7.66\u00d71010\u00a0km3 (0.0704 Earths)[d] |\n| Mass | 1.4819\u00d71023\u00a0kg \n(0.025 Earths)[8] |\n| Mean density\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Titan is the tenth-largest object in the solar system, including the Sun. Before the arrival of *Voyager 1* in 1980, Titan was thought to be slightly larger than Ganymede (diameter 5,262 kilometers (3,270\u00a0mi)) and thus the largest moon in the Solar System; this was an overestimation caused by Titan's dense, opaque atmosphere, with a haze layer 100-200 kilometres above its surface. This increases its apparent diameter.[31] Titan's diameter and mass (and thus its density) are similar to those of the Jovian moons Ganymede and Callisto.[32] Based on its bulk density of 1.88\u00a0g/cm3, Titan's composition is half ice and half rocky material. Though similar in composition to Dione and Enceladus, it is denser due to gravitational compression. It has a mass 1/4226 that of Saturn, making it the largest moon of the gas giants relative to the mass of its primary. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTitan is one of the seven gravitationally rounded moons in orbit around Saturn, and the second most distant from Saturn of those seven. Frequently described as a planet-like moon, Titan is 50% larger (in diameter) than Earth's Moon and 80% more massive. It is the second-largest moon in the Solar System after Jupiter's moon Ganymede, and is larger than the planet Mercury, but only 40% as massive.\n\n\nDiscovered in 1655 by the Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens, Titan was the first known moon of Saturn, and the sixth known planetary satellite (after Earth's moon and the four Galilean moons of Jupiter). Titan orbits Saturn at 20 Saturn radii. From Titan's surface, Saturn subtends an arc of 5.09 degrees, and if it were visible through the moon's thick atmosphere, it would appear 11.4 times larger in the sky, in diameter, than the Moon from Earth, which subtends 0.48\u00b0 of arc.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | 1.352\u00a0m/s2 (0.138\u00a0*g*) |\n| Moment of inertia factor\n | 0.3414\u00b10.0005[9] (estimate) |\n| Escape velocity\n | 2.641\u00a0km/s |\n| Synodic rotation period\n | Synchronous |\n| Axial tilt\n | Zero (to the orbital plane);27\u00b0 (to the sun) |\n| Albedo | 0.22 (geometric) [10]\n0.265\u00b10.03 (Bond)[11] |\n| Temperature | 93.7\u00a0K (\u2212179.5\u00a0\u00b0C)[12] |\n| Apparent magnitude\n | 8.2[13] to 9.0 |\n| Atmosphere |\n| Surface pressure\n | 146.7\u00a0kPa (1.45\u00a0atm) |\n| Composition by volume | Variable\nStratosphere:98.4% nitrogen (N2),1.4% methane (CH4),0.2% hydrogen (H2);\n\nLower troposphere:95.0% N2, 4.9% CH4;[14]97% N2, 2.7\u00b10.1% CH4, 0.1\u20130.2% H2[15] |\n|  |\n\n\n**Titan** is the largest Moon of **Saturn** and the second-largest moon in our Solar System, larger than any of the dwarf planets of the Solar System.

Christiaan, with the help of his elder brother Constantijn Huygens Jr., began building telescopes around 1650 and discovered the first observed moon orbiting Saturn with one of the telescopes they built.[21] It was the sixth moon ever discovered, after Earth's Moon and the Galilean moons of Jupiter.[22]\n\n\nTitan is the largest and brightest moon of Saturn, and so is the easiest to observe of Saturn's moons with a standard optical telescope from Earth. \n\n\n\n### Naming[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nTitan is the largest moon of Saturn and second largest moon in our solar system\n\nNot to be confused with Titania (moon) or Triton (moon).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* S/2004 S 53\n* S/2004 S 36\n* Thiazzi\n* S/2019 S 20\n* S/2006 S 19\n* Saturn LXIV\n* Fornjot\n* S/2004 S 51\n* S/2020 S 10\n* S/2020 S 9\n* Saturn LVIII\n* S/2019 S 21\n* S/2004 S 52\n |\n| Outlier progradeirregular moons | - S/2006 S 12\n\n- S/2019 S 6\n\n- S/2004 S 24\n |\n| * Rings of Saturn\n* Cassini\u2013Huygens\n* Chiron\n* Chrysalis\n* Themis\n* S/2004 S 3\n* S/2004 S 4\n* S/2004 S 6\n* In fiction\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nSolar System\n |\n| --- |\n| ![The Sun, the planets, their moons, and several trans-Neptunian objects](image)\n |\n| * Sun\n\t+ Heliosphere\n | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| * Planets\n\t+ Rings\n\t+ Moons\n | * **Mercury**\n* **Venus**\n* **Earth**\n\t+ 1 moon\n* **Mars**\n\t+ 2 moons: Phobos\n\t+ Deimos\n* **Jupiter**\n\t+ Rings\n\t+ 95 moons: Ganymede\n\t+ Callisto\n\t+ Io\n\t+ Europa\n* **Saturn**\n\t+ Rings\n\t+ 146 moons: Titan\n\t+ Rhea\n\t+ Iapetus\n\t+ Dione\n\t+ Tethys\n\t+ Enceladus\n\t+ Mimas\n* **Uranus**\n\t+ Rings\n\t+ 28 moons: Titania\n\t+ Oberon\n\t+ Umbriel\n\t+ Ariel\n\t+ Miranda\n* **Neptune**\n\t+ Rings\n\t+ 16 moons: Triton\n |\n| Minorplanets | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n6. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Unless otherwise specified: \"JPL HORIZONS solar system data and ephemeris computation service\". *Solar System Dynamics*.

The body of the Moon is differentiated and terrestrial, with no significant hydrosphere, atmosphere, or magnetic field. It formed 4.51\u00a0billion years ago, not long after Earth's formation, out of the debris from a giant impact between Earth and a hypothesized Mars-sized body called Theia.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)A view of the rotating Earth and the far side of the Moon as the Moon passes on its orbit in between the observing DSCOVR satellite and Earth\nThe Earth and the Moon form the Earth-Moon satellite system with a shared center of mass, or barycenter.

Schmitt next to a large Moon boulder\nThe topography of the Moon has been measured with laser altimetry and stereo image analysis.[112] Its most extensive topographic feature is the giant far-side South Pole\u2013Aitken basin, some 2,240\u00a0km (1,390\u00a0mi) in diameter, the largest crater on the Moon and the second-largest confirmed impact crater in the Solar System.[113][114] At 13\u00a0km (8.1\u00a0mi) deep, its floor is the lowest point on the surface of the Moon.[113][115] The highest elevations of the Moon's surface are located directly to the northeast, which might have been thickened by the oblique formation impact of the South Pole\u2013Aitken basin.[116] Other large impact basins such as Imbrium, Serenitatis, Crisium, Smythii, and Orientale possess regionally low elevations and elevated rims.[113] The far side of the lunar surface is on average about 1.9\u00a0km (1.2\u00a0mi) higher than that of the near side.[1]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWhile the giant-impact theory explains many lines of evidence, some questions are still unresolved, most of which involve the Moon's composition.[56] Models that have the Moon acquiring a significant amount of the proto-earth are more difficult to reconcile with geochemical data for the isotopes of zirconium, oxygen, silicon, and other elements.[57] Above a high resolution threshold for simulations,[*clarify*] a study published in 2022 finds that giant impacts can immediately place a satellite with similar mass and iron content to the Moon into orbit far outside Earth's Roche limit. Even satellites that initially pass within the Roche limit can reliably and predictably survive, by being partially stripped and then torqued onto wider, stable orbits.[58]\n\n\nOn 1 November 2023, scientists reported that, according to computer simulations, remnants of a protoplanet, named Theia, could be inside the Earth, left over from a collision with the Earth in ancient times, and afterwards becoming the Moon.[59][60]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Moon is the second-densest satellite in the Solar System, after Io.[76] However, the inner core of the Moon is small, with a radius of about 350 kilometres (220\u00a0mi) or less,[1] around 20% of the radius of the Moon. Its composition is not well understood, but is probably metallic iron alloyed with a small amount of sulfur and nickel; analyses of the Moon's time-variable rotation suggest that it is at least partly molten.[77] The pressure at the lunar core is estimated to be 5\u00a0GPa (49,000\u00a0atm).[78]\n\n\n\n### Gravitational field[edit]\n\n\n![](image)An astronaut jumping on the Moon, illustrating that the gravitational pull of the Moon is approximately 1/6 of Earth's.\nOn average the Moon's surface gravity is 1.62\u00a0m/s2[4] (0.1654\u00a0g; 5.318\u00a0ft/s2), about half of the surface gravity of Mars and about a sixth of Earth's.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n64. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Hiesinger, H.; Head, J.
