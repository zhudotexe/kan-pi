It is the largest utility company in the world. As of 2022[update], State Grid is the world's third largest company overall by revenue, behind Walmart and Saudi Aramco.[5] In 2022 it was reported as having 871,145 employees, 1.1 billion customers and revenue equivalent to US$460 billion. It is overseen by the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council.\n\n\nAfter the electricity Plant-Grid Separation reform in early 2002, the assets of State Electric Power Corporation (国家电力公司) were divided into five power generation groups that retained the power plants and five regional subsidiaries belonging to the State Grid Corporation of China in Beijing.[6]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nChina began an initiative to reform the country's power sector in a three-stage process in 1986.[7] In the third and final stage in March 2002 the State Council of the People's Republic of China put into effect a plan to restructure the country's electric power system in order to create competition and separate generation and transmission functions.[8] The State Grid Corporation of China was founded on December 29, 2002, when the restructuring divided the former State Power Corporation of China into two grid companies, five generation groups and four accessorial business companies.[9] The two grid companies created were the State Grid Corporation of China and a smaller China Southern Power Grid Company.[10] SGCC accounts for 80% of the Chinese grid, with China Southern Power Grid accounting for the other 20%.[11]: 40 At its creation, SGCC company had a generation capacity of 6.47 gigawatts.[8]\n\n\nIn 2003 and progressively so through the early 2000s, electrical shortages caused the government to institute rolling blackouts. The State Grid Corporation estimated there were 1 trillion yuan in losses from 2002 to 2005.[8] The State Grid Corporation of China ran the first 1,000-kilovolt alternating current power line between Northern Shanxi and center Hubei in January 2009. In 2012 it began operation of an 800-kilovolt direct current line that sends hydropower from western Sichuan to Shanghai. It also has an alternating current loop line in the Yangtze River delta, and three longitudinal alternating current lines that bring power to Southern China from the Northern region.[12]\n\n\nThe State Grid Corporation was involved in a multi-phase smart-grid project for China's electrical grid planned for 2011–2015.[13] China's smart grid efforts are different from those in the United States in that its plans heavily use ultra high voltage (UHV) lines. Several UHV construction projects began in 2012 to bring UHV power lines across Huainan, Wannan, and Shanghai and another from Xilingol League to Nanjing. By 2015, the company planned to have three more horizontal UHV lines through West Inner Mongolia to Weifang, from Central Shanxi–Xuzhou to Yaan–southern Anhui and 11 other lines by 2015.[12]\n\n\nIn 2012 the company invested in CDP Reti.\n\n\nFrom 2010 to 2020 the companies investments in grid expansion rose from 291.12 BioYuan to 460.5 BioYuan.[14]\n\n\n\n## Controversy[edit]\n\n\nOn October 29, 2014, The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection declared that the general manager of State Grid Shanghai Municipal Electric Power, Feng Jun, was detained in an anti-graft operation overseen by the commission.[15] In 2017, his assets (worth 53 million yuan) were seized, and he was sentenced to life in prison.[16]\n\n\n\n## Overseas investments[edit]\n\n\n### Philippines[edit]\n\n\nOn December 12, 2007, two consortia bid for a 25-year license to run the Philippines power grid—privatization of the management of the Philippine government-owned National Transmission Corporation (TransCo), the consortium of Monte Oro Grid Resources Corp., led by businessman Enrique Razon, comprising the State Grid Corporation of China, and Calaca High Power Corp., won an auction conducted by the Power Sector Assets and Liabilities Management (PSALM) Corp. as it submitted the highest offer of $3.95 billion, for the right to operate TransCo for 25 years, outbidding San Miguel Energy, a unit of the Filipino San Miguel Corporation (bid of $3.905 billion), Dutch firm TPG Aurora BV, and Malaysia's TNB Prai Sdn Bhd.[17][18][19] This initiated the privatization process for the transmission sector. The resulting consortium became the National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP).[20]\n\n\nOn February 21, 2008, NGCP was registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\n\nOn February 28, 2008, TransCo's concession agreement with NGCP was executed and became effective. The agreement between NGCP and TransCo was signed by TransCo president Arthur Aguilar, PSALM president Jose Ibazeta, and NGCP directors Walter Brown, Elmer Pedregosa and Du Zhigang.[21][22] In November of that same year, Congress approved bicameral resolution granting franchise to NGCP to manage and operate its transmission facilities nationwide. President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo signed Republic Act 9511 which granted NGCP to operate and manage the country's power grid in December 2008.\n\n\nOn January 15, 2009, TransCo turned over the operations, maintenance, and management of the transmission system to NGCP which marked the start of the 25-year concession period and franchise and renewable for another 25 years with a total of 50 years, which privatized the operations and maintenance of the Philippine power grid and its related assets and facilities and turned over from the Philippine government to the private sector. The franchise and concession period will end on December 1, 2058.[23][24][25]\n\n\n\n### Other countries[edit]\n\n\nIn Portugal, State Grid has a 25% stake in REN since the second stage of its privatization (in 2012–2014).[26]\n\n\nIn Australia, State Grid owns a 41% stake in ElectraNet, a 19.9% stake in AusNet Services, and 60% stake in Jemena.[27]\n\n\nIn Brazil, State Grid is involved in developing, building, and operating hydropower facilities.[11]: 207 State Grid acquired the control of CPFL Energia S.A. for the equivalent of US$3.4 billion in 2017.[28] State Grid built the 2000 km Ultra High Voltage power line delivering hydropower to the megacities Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo.[29]\n\n\nIn Chile, State Grid acquired Chilquinta Energía, the third-largest distributor of electricity in Chile, and Tecnored SA, which provides construction services to Chilquinta, from U.S. power company Sempra Energy. The deal was closed on June 24, 2020.[30] On 13 November 2020, it was announced that State Grid had reached an agreement to acquire Compañia General de Electricidad (CGE), the largest distribution of electricity in this country.[31]\n\n\n\n## Subsidiaries[edit]\n\n\n* State Grid Yingda Group\n\t+ Yingda International Trust (89.76%)\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Energy portal\n* ![](image)Companies portal\n\n\n* China Southern Power Grid\n* China Datang Corporation\n* List of companies of China\n* Smart grid\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"State Grid's 2017 financial report\".

In the restructuring, CNPC injected into PetroChina most of the assets and liabilities of CNPC relating to its hydrocarbon exploration and production, refining and marketing, chemicals and natural gas businesses. CNPC and PetroChina develop overseas assets through a joint venture, the CNPC Exploration & Development Company (CNODC), which is 50% owned by PetroChina.\n\n\nIn March 2014, CNPC Chairman Zhou Jiping announced that CNPC would be opening six business units to private investors.[6]\n\n\nCNPC also has a memorandum of understanding with UOP Llc, under which the two companies will collaborate on a range of biofuels technologies and projects in China.[7]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nUnlike the Chinese Petroleum Corporation (CPC Corporation), which was relocated to Taiwan with the retreat of the Republic of China following the communist revolution in 1949, CNPC can be traced from the beginning as a governmental department of the Government of the People's Republic of China. In 1949, the Chinese government formed a 'Fuel Industry Ministry' dedicated to the management of fuel. In January 1952 a division of the fuel ministry was formed to manage petroleum exploration and mining, called the 'Chief Petroleum Administration Bureau'. In July 1955 a new ministry was created to replace the Fuel Industry Ministry, called the Ministry of Petroleum. From 1955 to 1969, approximately 4 oil fields were found in 4 areas in Qinghai, Heilongjiang (Daqing oilfield), Bohai Bay and Songliao basin. CNPC was created on 17 September 1988, when the government decided to create a state-owned company to handle all Petroleum activities in China and disbanded the Ministry of Petroleum.[8][9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n### Human rights[edit]\n\n\nIn 2011, Earthrights International accused PetroChina, a subsidiary of CNPC, of complicity in serious human rights abuses in Burma,[72][73] a country known for militarily furthering its economic interests through the use of forced labor.[74][75]\n\n\n\n### Tax issues[edit]\n\n\nIn January 2014, the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists published research based on leaked financial records from the British Virgin Islands, implicating CNPC, PetroChina, Sinopec, and CNOOC in offshore tax evasion.[76][77]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)China portal\n* ![icon](image)Energy portal\n* ![](image)Companies portal\n\n\n* List of oil spills\n* CNPC (HK)\n* Petroleum industry in China\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** A common shortname for the corporation in Chinese, *Zhongguo Shiyou* (中国石油), formerly shared the same name as the Chinese Petroleum Corporation, the Republic of China (Taiwan)'s state-owned fuel corporation.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Fuel prices at a PetroChina petrol station in Dalian, Liaoning, China, 2009\nCNPC holds proven reserves of 3.7 billion barrels (590,000,000 m3) of oil equivalent.

The CNPC subsidiary SAPET signed a service contract with the government of Peru to operate Block VII in the Talara Province basin.[10] This was followed by an oil contract with the government of Sudan \"In June 1997, the Greater Nile Petroleum Operating Company was established with the China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) taking 40 percent ownership\".[11] \nIn August 2005 it was announced that CNPC agreed to buy the Alberta-based PetroKazakhstan for US$4.18 billion, then the largest overseas acquisition by a Chinese company. The acquisition went through on 26 October 2005 after a Canadian court turned down an attempt by LUKoil to block the sale.[12] In 2006 67% of shares were sold from the parent company to PetroChina[13]\nIn June 1997, the company bought a 60.3% stake in the Aktobe Oil Company of Kazakhstan, and in July 1997 CNPC won an oil contract for the Intercampo oilfield and East Caracoles oilfield in Venezuela.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Rig operators | * China Oilfield Services (CNOOC)\n* Great Wall Drilling Company (CNPC)\n* ZPEB (Sinopec)\n* ZPEC\n |\n| Drilling equipment | * Jereh Group\n* Kerui Petroleum\n |\n\n |\n| EPC | * China Petroleum Pipeline Engineering (CNPC)\n* China Huanqiu Contracting & Engineering Corporation (CNPC)\n* China Petroleum Engineering and Construction Corporation (CNPC)\n* Kerui Petroleum\n |\n| Refineries | * ChemChina\n* Fushun Petrochemical Company (CNPC)\n* Shanghai Petrochemical (Sinopec)\n* Sinochem\n |\n| * Economy of China\n* Companies of China\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nPetroleum industry\n |\n| --- |\n| * Petroleum\n* Primary energy\n |\n| Benchmarks | * Argus Sour\n* Bonny Light\n* Brent\n* Dubai\n* Indian Basket\n* Indonesian\n* Isthmus-34 Light\n* Japan Cocktail\n* OPEC Reference Basket\n* Tapis\n* Urals\n* West Texas Intermediate\n* Western Canadian Select\n |\n| Data | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n![China](image) Oil and gas in China\n |\n| --- |\n| Energy in China\n |\n| Oil and gas majors(Upstream/Downstream) | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Big 3 | * CNPC\n* Sinopec\n* CNOOC\n |\n| Major listed arms | * PetroChina (CNPC)\n* Kunlun Energy (CNPC)\n* China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation (Sinopec)\n* CNOOC Limited (CNOOC)\n |\n\n |\n| Oil(Upstream) | * CITIC Resources\n* Geo-Jade Petroleum\n* Shaanxi Yanchang Petroleum\n* Shandong Energy\n* Emerald Energy\n\t+ Sinochem\n* United Energy Group\n* Zhenhua Oil\n |\n| Natural gas | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Upstream | * GCL-Poly\n* Shell China\n |\n| Coalbed methane | * China United Coalbed Methane (CNOOC)\n* PetroChina Coalbed Methane (CNPC)\n* Shanxi Blue Flame Coalbed Methane Group\n |\n| Downstream | * China Natural Gas\n* ENN Group\n* Shenergy\n* Towngas China\n |\n\n |\n| Drilling services | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter South Sudan's independence in 2011, South Sudan's territory included many of the Sudanese oil fields where CNPC (as well as Sinopec) have significant interests.[21]: 165 CNPC is a major investor in South Sudan's oil sector.
