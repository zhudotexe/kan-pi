In 2009, the two organizations parted ways to produce independent university rankings, the QS World University Rankings and THE World University Rankings. \n\n\nQS’ rankings portfolio have since been expanded to consist of the QS World University Rankings, the QS World University Rankings by Subject, four regional rankings tables including: Asia, Latin America, Europe, Central Asia, the Arab Region, several MBA rankings, and the QS Best Student Cities rankings. \n\n\nIn 2022, QS launched the QS World University Rankings: Sustainability.[1]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n### QS World University Rankings[edit]\n\n\nThe QS World University Rankings are released annually, typically in June. The 2023 edition featured 1418 institutions across 100 locations. The rankings are based on a methodology that considers a range of factors, including academic reputation, employer reputation, research impact, and internationalization. The methodology is reviewed annually to ensure that it remains relevant and up-to-date. The most recent methodology used by QS to calculate the rankings includes the following indicators:[19]\n\n\n\n#### Academic reputation[edit]\n\n\nAccounting for 40% of the overall score, academic reputation relates to academic excellence and the scholarly esteem in which the world’s universities are held. It collates more than 150,000 responses from academics in more than 140 countries and locations.[20][21] QS has previously published the job titles and geographical distribution of the participants in this survey.[21]\n\n\n\n#### Faculty/student ratio[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nQS World University Rankings: Global Top 10\n| Institution | 2024 | 2023 | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 | 2018\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![United States](image)Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1\n |\n| ![United Kingdom](image)University of Cambridge | 2 | 2 | 3 | 7 | 7 | 6 | 5\n |\n| ![United Kingdom](image)University of Oxford | 3 | 4 | 1 | 5 | 4 | 5 | 6\n |\n| ![United States](image)Harvard University | 4 | 5 | 5 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3\n |\n| ![United States](image)Stanford University | 5 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2\n |\n| ![United Kingdom](image)Imperial College London | 6 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 8 | 8\n |\n| ![Switzerland](image)ETH Zurich | 7 | 9 | 8 | 6 | 6 | 7 | 10\n |\n| ![Singapore](image) National University of Singapore | 8 | 11 | 11 | 11 | 11 | 11 | 15\n |\n| ![United Kingdom](image)University College London | 9 | 8 | 8 | 10 | 8 | 10 | 7\n |\n| ![United States](image)University of California, Berkeley | 10 | 27 | 32 | 30 | 28 | 27 | 27\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2022, QS launched the QS World University Rankings: Sustainability in response to the growing importance of sustainability in higher education and society at large. \n\n\nThe rankings are compiled using data collected through surveys as well as external sources such as the World Bank and the United Nations to provide a resource for students, academics and policymakers to assess universities’ sustainability performance and identify best practices for achieving sustainability goals. \n\n\nThe rank of the universities featured is determined by the sum of their scores in two categories: Environmental Impact and Social Impact, which are subdivided into eight indicators.

The 2023 edition featured 1418 institutions across 100 locations. The rankings are based on a methodology that considers a range of factors, including academic reputation, employer reputation, research impact, and internationalization. The methodology is reviewed annually to ensure that it remains relevant and up-to-date. The most recent methodology used by QS to calculate the rankings includes the following indicators:[19]\n\n\n\n#### Academic reputation[edit]\n\n\nAccounting for 40% of the overall score, academic reputation relates to academic excellence and the scholarly esteem in which the world’s universities are held. It collates more than 150,000 responses from academics in more than 140 countries and locations.[20][21] QS has previously published the job titles and geographical distribution of the participants in this survey.[21]\n\n\n\n#### Faculty/student ratio[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n***QS World University Rankings*** is a portfolio of comparative college and university rankings compiled by Quacquarelli Symonds, a higher education analytics firm.

In 2009, the two organizations parted ways to produce independent university rankings, the QS World University Rankings and THE World University Rankings. \n\n\nQS’ rankings portfolio have since been expanded to consist of the QS World University Rankings, the QS World University Rankings by Subject, four regional rankings tables including: Asia, Latin America, Europe, Central Asia, the Arab Region, several MBA rankings, and the QS Best Student Cities rankings. \n\n\nIn 2022, QS launched the QS World University Rankings: Sustainability.[1]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nQS World University Rankings: Global Top 10\n| Institution | 2024 | 2023 | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 | 2018\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![United States](image)Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1\n |\n| ![United Kingdom](image)University of Cambridge | 2 | 2 | 3 | 7 | 7 | 6 | 5\n |\n| ![United Kingdom](image)University of Oxford | 3 | 4 | 1 | 5 | 4 | 5 | 6\n |\n| ![United States](image)Harvard University | 4 | 5 | 5 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3\n |\n| ![United States](image)Stanford University | 5 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2\n |\n| ![United Kingdom](image)Imperial College London | 6 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 8 | 8\n |\n| ![Switzerland](image)ETH Zurich | 7 | 9 | 8 | 6 | 6 | 7 | 10\n |\n| ![Singapore](image) National University of Singapore | 8 | 11 | 11 | 11 | 11 | 11 | 15\n |\n| ![United Kingdom](image)University College London | 9 | 8 | 8 | 10 | 8 | 10 | 7\n |\n| ![United States](image)University of California, Berkeley | 10 | 27 | 32 | 30 | 28 | 27 | 27\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe rankings are regarded as one of the most-widely read university rankings in the world, along with *Academic Ranking of World Universities* and *Times Higher Education World University Rankings*.[2]\n\n\nAccording to Alexa Internet, it is the most widely viewed university ranking worldwide.[3]\n\n\nThe ranking has been criticized for its overreliance on subjective indicators and reputation surveys, which tend to fluctuate over time and form a feedback loop.[4][5][6][7][8]\n\n\nConcerns also exist regarding the global consistency and integrity of the data used to generate the QS rankings.[5][9][10][11]\n\n\nThe development and production of the rankings is overseen by QS Senior Vice President Ben Sowter, who in 2016 was ranked in 40th position in Wonkhe's 2016 \"Higher Education Power List\", a list of what the organisation believed to be the 50 most influential figures in UK (United Kingdom) higher education.[12]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n### QS World University Rankings: Regional Rankings[edit]\n\n\nIn addition to the World University Rankings, QS produces four regional rankings, including the Arab Region, Asia, Emerging Europe and Central Asia (discontinued), and Latin America.

Called QS Stars, this service is separate from the QS World University Rankings. It involves a detailed look at a range of functions which mark out a modern, global university. The minimum result that a university can receive is zero Stars, while truly exceptional, world-leading universities can receive '5\\*+', or 'Five Star Plus', status. The QS Stars audit process evaluates universities according to about 50 different indicators. By 2018, about 20 different universities worldwide had been awarded the maximum possible Five Star Plus rating.[59]\n\n\nQS Stars[60] ratings are derived from scores on in eight out of 12 categories. Four categories are mandatory, while institutions must choose the remaining four optional categories.[61] They are:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n### QS World University Rankings: Regional Rankings[edit]\n\n\nIn addition to the World University Rankings, QS produces four regional rankings, including the Arab Region, Asia, Emerging Europe and Central Asia (discontinued), and Latin America. In 2023, QS will launch the QS World University Rankings: Europe. These editions include an expanded roster of ranked universities for each region than those featured in the QS World University Rankings which only feature the very best in location. \n\n\nWhile the same methodological indicators tend to be used for the regional rankings, the weightings are modified and additional lenses are included to account for the unique characteristics of each region. Additional metrics include incoming and outgoing exchange students, academic staff with a PhD, and web visibility. Accordingly, the performance of institutions within their respective regional rankings can differ significantly from the QS World University Rankings released in the same academic year.[31]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nQS was founded by Nunzio Quacquarelli in 1990 to provide information and advice to students looking to study abroad. Since then, the company expanded to include a wider range of higher education-focused products and services before partnering with THE in 2004 to create the THE-QS World University Rankings. \n\n\nA perceived need for an international ranking of universities for UK purposes was highlighted in December 2003 in Richard Lambert's review of university-industry collaboration in Great Britain[13] for HM Treasury, the finance ministry of the United Kingdom. Amongst its recommendations were world university rankings, which Lambert said would help the UK gauge the global standing of its universities.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Asian University Rankings – QS Asian University Rankings vs. QS World University Rankings™\".

But with this narrow focus comes drawbacks. China's priority was for its universities to \"catch up\" on hard scientific research. So if you're looking for raw research power, it's the list for you.

The first rankings produced by QS independently of *THE*, and using QS's methodology, were released in September 2010; the second rankings were released a year later, in September 2011.\n\n\nQS designed its rankings to assess performance according to what it believes to be key aspects of a university's mission: teaching, research, nurturing employability, and internationalisation.[17]\n\n\nQS has a global presence with offices in Europe, Asia, and the Americas and provides products and services related to student recruitment, events, and consulting services. In 2022, the firm's founder, Nunzio Quacquarelli, was appointed as the company's president.

The first rankings produced by QS independently of *THE*, and using QS's methodology, were released in September 2010; the second rankings were released a year later, in September 2011.\n\n\nQS designed its rankings to assess performance according to what it believes to be key aspects of a university's mission: teaching, research, nurturing employability, and internationalisation.[17]\n\n\nQS has a global presence with offices in Europe, Asia, and the Americas and provides products and services related to student recruitment, events, and consulting services. In 2022, the firm's founder, Nunzio Quacquarelli, was appointed as the company's president. Jessica Turner serves as the company's chief executive officer, responsible for the firm's operations and strategy.[18]\n\n\n\n## Rankings[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Employability (35% – 30% in Finance and Business Analytics)\n* Alumni Outcomes (15% – 20% in Finance and Business Analytics)\n* Return on Investment (20%)\n* Thought Leadership (15%)\n* Class and Faculty Diversity (10%)\n\n\nIn addition, QS produces two other annual MBA comparisons, the Online MBA Rankings[33] and the Executive MBA Rankings.[34]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\nIn September 2015, *The Guardian* referred to the QS World University Rankings as \"the most authoritative of their kind\".[35][36]\n\n\nIn September 2012, *The Independent* described the QS World University Rankings as being \"widely recognised throughout higher education as the most trusted international tables\".[37]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nQS was founded by Nunzio Quacquarelli in 1990 to provide information and advice to students looking to study abroad. Since then, the company expanded to include a wider range of higher education-focused products and services before partnering with THE in 2004 to create the THE-QS World University Rankings. \n\n\nA perceived need for an international ranking of universities for UK purposes was highlighted in December 2003 in Richard Lambert's review of university-industry collaboration in Great Britain[13] for HM Treasury, the finance ministry of the United Kingdom. Amongst its recommendations were world university rankings, which Lambert said would help the UK gauge the global standing of its universities.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n56. **^** \"促勿沉迷追逐QS大学排名 学者：教育不是利润商品|中國報\". *中國報 China Press*. 17 November 2023.
