Listings for *Economics* refer to the related Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. The Nobel Prizes and the Prize in Economic Sciences have been awarded 567 times to 889 recipients, of which 26 awards (all Peace Prizes) were to organizations. Due to some recipients receiving multiple awards, the total number of recipients is 860 individuals and 22 organizations.[1]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe present list ranks laureates under the country/countries that are stated by the Nobel Prize committee on its website.[2] The list does not distinguish between laureates who received a full prize and the majority who shared a prize.[3] Some laureates are listed under more than one country, because the official website mentions multiple countries in relation to the laureate.[4] If a country is merely mentioned as the place of birth, an asterisk (\\*) is used in the respective listing to indicate this.[5] In this case, the birth country is mentioned in *italics* at the other listings of this laureate.\n\n\nOrganizations are listed here if the Nobel Prize committee relates them to a single country.[6]\n\n\n\n## Summary[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Statistics about the Nobel Prize at the official website.\n2. **^** Chronological list of *All Nobel Laureates* on the official website of the Nobel Prize committee.\n3. **^** J\u00fcrgen Schmidhuber (2010): Evolution of National Nobel Prize Shares in the 20th Century, ArXiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/1009.2634, web site \"Archived copy\".

In each constituent nation, the population of England was 49,449,700, Scotland had a population of 5,064,200, Wales had a population of 2,910,200 and Northern Ireland a population of 1,689,300.[5] Increased international migration which began to rapidly increase at the end of the 20th century also has brought increased ethnic heterogenization to the British population, not only in ethnicity and race, but also in country of birth. In 2001, the White British population was registered to be 88.52% of the total population, but by 2011, this proportion of the population had dropped to 81.88%, with other ethnic groups either rising by 50% of their respective total population in 2001 or doubling entirely.\n\n\nSuch rapid immigration growth boosted population growth in the United Kingdom. In 2011, the population sat at around 63 million people.\n\n\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nUnited Kingdom population at census dates[32][33][34]\n| Intercensal period\n | Population at start of period\n | Average annual numbers of\n | Population density at start of period (per km2)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Overall change\n | Births\n | Deaths\n | Net natural change\n | Net migrationetc.\n |\n| 1851\u20131861\n | 27,368,800\n | 154,910\n | Un\u00adknown\n | Un\u00adknown\n | Un\u00adknown\n | Un\u00adknown\n | 87\n |\n| 1861\u20131871\n | 28,917,900\n | 256,680\n | Un\u00adknown\n | Un\u00adknown\n | Un\u00adknown\n | Un\u00adknown\n | 92\n |\n| 1871\u20131881\n | 31,484,700\n | 344,980\n | Un\u00adknown\n | Un\u00adknown\n | Un\u00adknown\n | Un\u00adknown\n | 100\n |\n| 1881\u20131891\n | 34,934,500\n | 286,790\n | Un\u00adknown\n | Un\u00adknown\n | Un\u00adknown\n | Un\u00adknown\n | 111\n |\n| 1891\u20131901\n | 37,802,400\n | 373,580\n | Un\u00adknown\n | Un\u00adknown\n | Un\u00adknown\n | Un\u00adknown\n | 120\n |\n| 1901\u20131911\n | 38,237,000\n | 385,000\n | 1,091,000\n | 624,000\n | 467,000\n | \u221282,000\n | 156\n |\n| 1911\u20131921\n | 42,082,000\n | 195,000\n | 975,000\n | 689,000\n | 286,000\n | \u221292,000\n | 172\n |\n| 1921\u20131931\n | 44,027,000\n | 201,000\n | 824,000\n | 555,000\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Nationality |\n| Nationality | British |\n| Major ethnic | ![Decrease](image) White: 87.17% \n![Decrease](image) White British/Irish: 82.8% (2011) |\n| Minor ethnic | ![Increase](image) Asian British: (6.3%)\n![Increase](image) Black British: (3.0%)\n![Increase](image) British Mixed: (2.0%)\n![Increase](image) Other: (0.9%) |\n| Language |\n| Spoken | British English |\n| Sources:[2] |\n\n\n\n\n\nThe population of the United Kingdom was estimated at over 67.0\u00a0million in 2020.

According to the most recent data, Germany's population is 84,432,670 (31 March 2023)[1] making it the most populous country in the European Union and the nineteenth-most populous country in the world. The total fertility rate was rated at 1.58 in 2021,[6] significantly below the replacement rate of 2.1. For a long time Germany had one of the world's lowest fertility rates of around 1.3 to 1.4, however there has been a small increase in recent years.[7] Due to the low birth rate Germany has recorded more deaths than births every year since 1972,[8] which means 2021 was the 50th consecutive year the German population would have decreased without immigration. However, due to immigration the population has actually increased during the last half-century. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n36. **^** \"Zusammengefasste Geburtenziffer in Deutschland (1871-2021)\". *Bundesinstitut f\u00fcr Bev\u00f6lkerungsforschung*.\n37. **^** \"Development of births\".

Since reunification, German authorities rely on a *micro census*.\nDemographic statistics according to the World Population Review.[28] Due to the privacy concerns of the German population after reunification, Germany did not hold a regular census until the EU-mandated 2011 German Census. The requirement was met with large disapproval. As required by the EU, Germany now continues to hold censuses every 10 years.[29]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n25. **^** Bujard, Martin (Hrsg.)

The capital city Stockholm has a municipal population of about 950,000 (with 1.5 million in the urban area and 2.3 million in the metropolitan area). The second- and third-largest cities are Gothenburg and Malm\u00f6. Greater Gothenburg counts just over a million inhabitants and the same goes for the western part of Scania, along the \u00d6resund. The \u00d6resund Region, the Danish-Swedish cross-border region around the \u00d6resund that Malm\u00f6 is part of, has a population of 4 million. \n</fragment>\n</document>",
