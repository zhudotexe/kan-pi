The president leads the executive branch of the Indonesian government and is the commander-in-chief of the Indonesian National Armed Forces. Since 2004, the president and vice president are directly elected to a five-year term, once renewable, allowing for a maximum of 10 years in office.\n\n\nJoko Widodo is the seventh and current president of Indonesia. He assumed office on 20 October 2014.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Sukarno era[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Indonesian presidency was established during the formulation of the 1945 Constitution by the Investigating Committee for Preparatory Work for Independence (BPUPK). The office was first filled on 18 August 1945 when Sukarno was elected by acclamation by the Preparatory Committee for Indonesian Independence (PPKI) because according to the Transitional Provisions of the, \"the President and the Vice President for the first time shall be elected by the PPKI.\" Also, the body responsible for the presidential elections, the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR), had not yet been formed.[3]: 138 On 16 October 1945, Vice President Mohammad Hatta announced a vice-presidential decree which gave the Central National Committee of Indonesia (KNIP) legislative powers.[3]: 152 On 11 November 1945, the KNIP made the decision to separate the role of Head of State from that of Head of Government. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Vice President of Indonesia\n* Presidential state car\n* Air Indonesia One\n* Paspampres\n* List of presidents of Indonesia\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Since 2004, previously via the People's Consultative Assembly.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring the 2001 MPR Annual Session, it was finally decided that from 2004 onwards, the president will directly be elected by the people.[13] In response to Sukarno and Suharto's abuses of power, other amendments passed at that session hedged the presidency about with numerous checks and balances to prevent another president from completely dominating the system. For example, the president was limited to two terms, whether successive or separated. He also lost the right to legislate, but could propose legislation.\n\n\nIn 2004 election, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono became Indonesia's first directly elected president, beating incumbent Megawati Sukarnoputri in the runoff election. He was re-elected in 2009. In 2014, Yudhoyono finished his second presidential term and was barred from seeking re-election.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe 3rd Indonesian presidential election was held on 9 July 2014 and matched former general and Suharto's ex-son in law Prabowo Subianto against the governor of Jakarta, Joko Widodo. On 22 July the General Elections Commission announced Joko Widodo's victory. He and his vice president, Jusuf Kalla, were sworn in on 20 October 2014, for a 5-year term.\n\n\n\n## Requirements to run for office[edit]\n\n\n**The Amended 1945 Constitution**: The presidential candidate has to be an Indonesian citizen since their birth, who has not willingly become a citizen in another nation, has not betrayed the nation, and is physically and mentally capable of performing the duties. Amended Constitution also states that further criteria will be determined by laws. The president is also required to be nominated by a Political Party or a coalition of Political Parties.\n\n\n**2017 Law No. 7 Regarding Presidential and Vice-Presidential Elections**  \nThe presidential candidate must:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSuharto fell from power in May 1998 and the presidency experienced changes as a result of the reform movement. Compared to Suharto, who had all of his accountability speeches accepted, B. J. Habibie had his only accountability speech rejected.[11] Abdurrahman Wahid then became the first president who had to beat another candidate to be elected, as Sukarno and Suharto had been sole candidates. As a result of this, Wahid was also the first president to be elected through counting votes instead of by acclamation. However, Wahid was impeached and removed from office by the MPR. This was a clear sign that while the presidency is the key institution, the MPR was now truly a check on the president's power. Wahid was replaced by his vice president, Megawati Sukarnoputri, daughter of Sukarno and former opposition leader during Suharto's presidency. Megawati is the first and, so far, only female ever to become President of Indonesia.[12]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Elected officials | * President of Indonesia\n\t+ *list*\n* Vice President of Indonesia\n\t+ *list*\n |\n| Cabinet (List) and Ministries | * Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs\n* Coordinating Minister for Human Development and Cultural Affairs\n* Coordinating Minister for Maritime Affairs\n* Coordinating Minister for Political, Legal, and Security Affairs\n* Agriculture\n* State Apparatus Utilization and Bureaucratic Reform\n* Communication and Information Technology\n* Cooperatives and Small & Medium Enterprises\n* Defense\n* Energy and Mineral Resources\n* Environment and Forestry\n* Women Empowerment and Child Protection\n* Finance\n* Foreign Affairs\n* Health\n* Home Affairs\n* Industry\n* Investment\n* Agrarian Affairs and Spatial Planning\n* Law and Human Rights\n* Manpower\n* Maritime Affairs and Fisheries\n* National Development Planning\n* Public Works and People's Housing\n* Religious Affairs\n* Education, Culture, Research, and Technology\n* Social Affairs\n* State Owned Enterprises\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n8. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Latar Belakang Dekrit Presiden 5 Juli 1959\" (in Indonesian).

Sukarno then gave a mandate for Sjafruddin Prawiranegara to form an emergency government.[4] This was done and the Emergency Government of the Republic of Indonesia (PDRI) was formed in Sumatra with Prawiranegara as its chairman. Prawiranegara handed back his mandate to Sukarno on 13 July 1949.[5] On 17 December 1949, Sukarno was elected president of the Republic of the United States of Indonesia (RIS) and presidential mandate passed to Assaat.[6] When it became clear that RIS was going to be replaced by a unitary state, Asaat stepped down from the presidency and Sukarno once again became president on 15 August 1950.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **This article is part of a series on the** |\n| Politics ofIndonesia |\n| ![](image) |\n| National government\n![](image)\n* **Constitution of Indonesia**\n\n\n* Law\n* Taxation\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n*Pancasila* (national philosophy)\n |\n| Executive\n![](image)\n* **President of Indonesia**\n\n\n* Joko Widodo (PDI-P)\n\n\n![](image)\n\n* **Vice President of Indonesia**\n\n\n* Ma'ruf Amin (Ind.)\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n* Cabinet\n\n\n* Regional government\n* Governors\n |\n| Legislature\n![](image)\n* **People's Consultative Assembly**\n\n\n* Speaker Bambang Soesatyo (Golkar)\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n![](image)\n\n* **House of Representatives**\n\n\n* Speaker Puan Maharani (PDI-P)\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n![](image)\n\n* **Regional Representative Council**\n\n\n* Speaker La Nyalla Mattalitti (East Java)\n |\n| Judiciary\n![](image)\n* **Supreme Court of Indonesia**\n\n\n* Chief Justice Muhammad Syarifuddin\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n![](image)\n\n* **Constitutional court**\n\n\n* Chief Justice Suhartoyo\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n* Judicial commission\n |\n| Elections\n![](image)\n* **General Elections Commission**\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Chairman Hasyim Asy'ari\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n* **Legislative elections**\n\t+ 1955 (Const.)\n\t+ 1955\n\t+ 1971\n\t+ 1977\n\t+ 1982\n\t+ 1987\n\t+ 1992\n\t+ 1997\n\t+ 1999\n\t+ 2004\n\t+ 2009\n\t+ 2014\n\t+ 2019\n\t+ 2024\n\n\n* **Presidential elections**\n\t+ 1999\n\t+ 2004\n\t+ 2009\n\t+ 2014\n\t+ 2019\n\t+ 2024\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n* Law\n* Electoral Districts\n |\n| Political parties\n* List of political parties\n |\n| Foreign relations\n* Diplomatic missions of / in Indonesia\n* Diplomatic missions in Jakarta\n |\n| * ![flag](image) Indonesia portal\n* ![icon](image) Politics portal\n |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Pledge of Office of the President of the Republic of Indonesia**: \"I solemnly pledge to fulfill the duties of President (Vice President) of the Republic of Indonesia to the best of my capabilities and in the fairest way possible, to uphold the Constitution by all means and to execute all laws and regulations as straightforwardly as possible as well as to dedicate myself to the service of the Nation and the People.\"\n\n\n\n## Powers[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * Abortion\n* Crime\n* Human trafficking\n* Piracy\n* Prostitution\n* Smoking\n |\n| Culture | * Architecture\n\t+ Candi\n\t+ Colonial\n\t+ Mosques\n\t+ *Rumah adat*\n* Art\n* Cinema\n* Costume\n* Cuisine\n* Dance\n* Festivals\n* Legends\n* Literature\n* Martial arts\n* Media\n* Music\n* Mythology\n* National heroes\n* Painting\n* Properties\n* Public holidays\n* Sport\n* Theatre\n* Video games\n |\n| Demographics | * Education\n* Ethnic groups\n* Health\n\t+ Healthcare\n* Homelessness\n* Languages\n* Religion\n* Refugees\n* Women\n* LGBT rights\n |\n| Symbols | * Anthem\n* Costume\n* Emblem\n\t+ Historical\n\t+ Subdivision\n* Faunal emblems\n* Flag\n\t+ Subdivision\n* Floral emblems\n* Motto\n* Nusantara\n* Personification\n* Songs\n |\n\n |\n| * Outline\n* Index\n\n* Category\n* Portal\n* Gallery\n* Atlas\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nPresidents of Indonesia\n |\n| --- |\n| * Sukarno\n* Suharto\n* B.

Nonetheless, he was never content with the role of ceremonial head of State, and grew increasingly disenchanted with western-style parliamentary democracy.

In 1973, the new Constitution established Parliamentary democracy and reduced the president's role to a ceremonial one. Nevertheless, the military takeover in 1977 reversed the changes. The 8th Amendment turned Pakistan into a semi-presidential republic and in the period between 1985 and 2010, the executive power was shared by the president and prime minister.

The presidency is a part of the system of people's congress based on the principle of unified power in which the National People's Congress (NPC) functions as the only branch of government and as the highest state organ of power. The presidency is a state organ of the NPC and equivalent to, for instance, the State Council and the National Supervisory Commission, rather than a political office, unlike the premier of the State Council. Together with the NPC Standing Committee, the presidency performs certain heads of state functions. The president can engage in state affairs with the consent of the NPC Standing Committee. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n11. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** \"Constitution of the People's Republic of China\". *National People's Congress*.

Upon the nomination of the premier, the NPC convenes to confirm the nomination, but since only one name is on the ballot, it can only approve or reject. To date, it has never rejected a personnel nomination.[18] Since the premier, the head of government in China, is the most important political appointment in the Chinese government, the nomination power, under some circumstances, may give the president real political influence.[19]\n\n\nThe director of the Office of the President of the PRC (Chinese: 中华人民共和国主席办公室; pinyin: *Zhōnghuá Rénmín Gònghéguó Zhǔxí Bàngōngshì*) is Cai Qi, who is also the director of the CCP General Office and the director of the CCP General Secretary Office.[20]\n\n\n\n## Political ranking[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Orders of precedence in China\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Part of a series on**Orders of succession** |\n| Presidencies |\n| * Argentina\n* Austria\n* Brazil\n* Colombia\n* China\n* DR Congo\n* Finland\n* France\n* Germany\n* India\n* Indonesia\n* Israel\n* Italy\n* Ireland\n* Republic of Korea\n* Mexico\n* Pakistan\n* Peru\n* Philippines\n* Poland\n* Romania\n* Sri Lanka\n* Taiwan\n* United States\n* Uruguay\n* Vietnam\n |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\n## Post title[edit]\n\n\nThe title of the office (Chinese: 国家主席; pinyin: *Guójiā Zhǔxí*), which literally translates to \"state chairman\", was unchanged in the Chinese text, but a new English translation of \"President of the People's Republic of China\" has been adopted since 1982, instead of \"Chairman of the People's Republic of China\".[16]\n\n\n\n## Order of succession[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the 1990s, the experiment of separating party and state posts, which led to conflict between Deng Xiaoping and Zhao Ziyang during the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, was terminated.

The position of the United States as the leading member of NATO, and the country's strong relationships with other wealthy or democratic nations like those comprising the European Union, have led to the moniker that the president is the \"leader of the free world.\"\n\n\n\n## Selection process[edit]\n\n\n### Eligibility[edit]\n\n\nArticle II, Section 1, Clause 5 of the Constitution sets three qualifications for holding the presidency. To serve as president, one must:\n\n\n\n* be a natural-born citizen of the United States;\n* be at least 35 years old;\n* be a resident in the United States for at least 14 years.[124]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe president is elected indirectly by the voters of each state and the District of Columbia through the Electoral College, a body of electors formed every four years for the sole purpose of electing the president and vice president to concurrent four-year terms. As prescribed by Article II, Section 1, Clause 2, each state is entitled to a number of electors equal to the size of its total delegation in both houses of Congress. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nChief executives of the United States\n |\n| --- |\n| Federal | * President of the United States\n\t+ list\n |\n| State governors(current list) | * Alabama\n* Alaska\n* Arizona\n* Arkansas\n* California\n\t+ list\n* Colorado\n* Connecticut\n* Delaware\n* Florida\n* Georgia\n\t+ list\n* Hawaii\n\t+ list\n* Idaho\n* Illinois\n\t+ list\n* Indiana\n\t+ list\n* Iowa\n* Kansas\n* Kentucky\n\t+ list\n* Louisiana\n\t+ list\n* Maine\n\t+ list\n* Maryland\n\t+ list\n* Massachusetts\n* Michigan\n\t+ list\n* Minnesota\n\t+ list\n* Mississippi\n\t+ list\n* Missouri\n* Montana\n* Nebraska\n* Nevada\n* New Hampshire\n\t+ list\n* New Jersey\n\t+ list\n* New Mexico\n\t+ list\n* New York\n\t+ list\n* North Carolina\n\t+ list\n* North Dakota\n\t+ list\n* Ohio\n* Oklahoma\n\t+ list\n* Oregon\n\t+ list\n* Pennsylvania\n* Rhode Island\n\t+ list\n* South Carolina\n\t+ list\n* South Dakota\n\t+ list\n* Tennessee\n\t+ list\n* Texas\n\t+ list\n* Utah\n* Vermont\n\t+ list\n* Virginia\n\t+ list\n* Washington\n* West Virginia\n* Wisconsin\n\t+ list\n* Wyoming\n |\n| Territorial(current list) | * American Samoa\n* District of Columbia\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Waldman, Michael; Stephanopoulos, George. *My Fellow Americans: The Most Important Speeches of America's Presidents, from George Washington to George W.

Crawford. Held February 9, 1825, this second and most recent contingent election resulted in John Quincy Adams being elected president on the first ballot.[142]\n\n\n\n### Inauguration[edit]\n\n\nMain article: United States presidential inauguration\n\nPursuant to the Twentieth Amendment, the four-year term of office for both the president and the vice president begins at noon on January 20.[143] The first presidential and vice presidential terms to begin on this date, known as Inauguration Day, were the second terms of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Vice President John Nance Garner in 1937.[144] Previously, Inauguration Day was on March 4. As a result of the date change, the first term (1933–37) of both men had been shortened by 43 days.[145]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_gYLHVdsKreep26JxbFCb45lv","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
