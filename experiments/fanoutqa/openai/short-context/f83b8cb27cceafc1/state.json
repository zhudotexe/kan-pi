Director Kartiki Gonsalves stated, \"I met Raghu when he was exactly three months old,\" she added, \"I spent about a year and a half with him when he was a tiny baby before this became a documentary.\" \n\n\nThe team spent nearly five years living the ongoing story of these caregivers and their baby elephant, working in a verite mode of letting the daily life and events of Bomman and Bellie tell the story of a life of an orphaned baby elephant (and his sudden unlikely sister, Amu!).\n\n\nOur intention in the process of documenting the journey of the protagonists was to create a fully immersive experience of the traditional elephant caregiver mahouts of southern India, in a way that honours the lifestyle and traditions of the Kattunayakan people, an ancient tribal community that Bomman and Bellie belong to who have been living with elephants for centuries. \n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Elephant Whisperers Team at the 95th Academy Awards\nOn the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes website, the film has an approval rating of 100% based on 5 reviews, with an average rating of 7.7/10.[11]\n\n\nRomey Norton of *Ready Steady Cut* rated the film 3.5 out of 5 and said that \"It packs a small punch and is definitely worth the watch, especially if you love elephants.\"[12] Poulomi Das, reviewing for Firstpost, wrote that the \"narrative is fairly straightforward, [and] the storytelling manages to be simultaneously gentle and persuasive.\" Praising the cinematography, Das wrote \"the film is elevated by its stunning cinematography.\" Das opined that \"Much of the beauty of the film lies in the understated coming-of-age of the film\u2019s narrative that draws ample parallels between humans and animals.\" Das said that *The Elephant Whisperers* \"is ultimately a love-story about the power of community,\" and concluded by saying, \"the film champions the dignity of \u2014 all kinds of \u2014 life.\"[13] Manjeet Singh of Leisure Byte, reviewing the film, praised it, writing, \"the complete documentary appears more like an experience that needs to be felt, than rather just to be seen.\" Singh opined that \"The docufilm is capable of making you cry, or even sob\" and it is \"the finest presentation of the year.\"[14]\n\n\n\n## Controversy[edit]\n\n\nIn an interview with the media outlet The Hindu, the tribal couple 'Bomman and Bellie' said they were exploited while shooting the 41-minute documentary. They further allege that the filmmakers did not remunerate them or deliver on the promises made, and that the director, who was amiable during the shoot, became distant after the movie won fame. All of these claims have been denied by the filmmaker. [15]\n\n\nBomman subsequently backtracked on his complaint in an video reported by India Today.\u00a0He stated that he did not know who sent the legal notice nor did he know the advocate, and he did not have any evidence.[16]\n\n\n\n## Accolades[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Award\n | Date of ceremony\n | Category\n | Recipient(s)\n | Result\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Academy Awards | 12 March 2023 | Best Documentary Short Film | Kartiki Gonsalves, Guneet Monga | Won\n | [17][3][18][19] |\n| DOC NYC | 9 November 2022\n | Shorts: Change Makers\n | *The Elephant Whisperers* | Shortlisted\n | [20] |\n| Hollywood Music in Media Awards | 16 November 2022 | Score \u2013 Short Film (Documentary)\n | Sven Faulconer\n | Nominated\n | [21] |\n| IDA Documentary Awards | 10 December 2022\n | Best Short Documentary\n | *The Elephant Whisperers* | Nominated\n | [22] |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Submissions for Best Documentary Short Academy Award\n* Mudumalai National Park\n* Theppakadu Elephant Camp\n* Tamil Nadu Forest Department\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Bomman and Bellie also speak this language of the Kattunayakan tribe, which is a mixture of Kannada, Malayalam and Tamil.[1][2]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Keswani, Pallavi (27 December 2022). \"'The Elephant Whisperers' documentary review: A strikingly-lush safari on the co-existence of man and nature\". *The Hindu*.

With the overwhelmingly positive critics reviews and audience response to the film\u2019s opening week, screenings expanded to more cities across the US.[21][22]\n\n\n\n## Accolades[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n*Writing with Fire* tells the story of *Khabar Lahariya*, the only news agency in India run by Dalit (oppressed-caste) women. Armed with smartphones, these women journalists report from some of the most difficult regions of the country, risking everything to speak truth to power. Led by Chief Reporter Meera and her feisty understudy, crime reporter Suneeta, the film bears witness to the wit, intelligence and compassion of these journalists in confronting the most urgent stories of our times.\n\n\nSet in the backdrop of an increasingly polarized world, *Writing with Fire* journeys with Meera and her band of sisters for five years - as they break traditions on the frontlines of India's biggest issues and within the confines of their homes, redefining what it truly means to be powerful.\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Critical reception[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n45. **^** \"2022 Finalists\". *Social Impact Media Awards*.

Thakkar won the Academy Award for creating the \"groundbreaking design\"[a] of DreamWorks Animation Media Review System, a scalable digital film review platform.\n\n\nThakkar was also a key member of the animation software development team for *Shrek*, which went on to win the first-ever Academy Award for Best Animated Feature at the 74th Academy Awards. He currently resides in Virginia, working in the aerospace industry for a Boeing subsidiary.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and family[edit]\n\n\nThakkar was born to Prabha Thakkar and Chandrakant Thakkar in the United Kingdom and was subsequently raised in India.[1] Thakkar's mother Prabha, whom he considered his inspiration, was a teacher and encouraged his interest in science.[2] His father Chandrakant was, as per Thakkar, an \"actor, writer and director\" apart from being a voice-over artist.[2][3]\n\n\nThakkar spent his early years in Mumbai and considers himself a *Mumbaikar*.[2] He completed his graduation from the University of Mumbai with a degree in computer science. Eventually, Thakkar studied at Utah State University to complete his Master's in computer science in 1995.[4]\n\n\nBecause of his father's background, Thakkar's early years in India were spent around actors. During these initial years, Thakkar worked with his father for some time in Mumbai, contributing to a 1971 Films Division of India documentary, and playing parts in television and radio shows. Thakkar also worked as a voice-over artist for television advertisements. At the same time, Thakkar's interest in mathematics and science remained predominant.[2] Later on, he moved to the United States as he believed it was easier to make visual effects movies in Hollywood.[4] Currently, Thakkar stays with his wife and a daughter in Virginia.[5]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nIn the United States, after graduating, Thakkar got a job offer from an animation studio[4] and worked for a few television advertisements, developing their visual effects.[5] Thakkar also developed the show opening software for CBS' 1994 and 1996 election coverage, and for the *Late Show with David Letterman*.[5]\n\n\nHe was soon invited by Pacific Data Images and he joined in 1996, to develop an animated film that turned out to be Antz.[4] PDI was soon acquired by DreamWorks in 2000,[4][6] where he headed the ' \"high performance particle system rendering software\" and \"colour management system and software\" teams.[7] While at DreamWorks, Thakkar worked with his mentor Richard Chuang (the co-founder of Pacific Data Images)[8] on designing the DreamWorks Animation Media Review System, which subsequently led Thakkar to jointly win the Academy Award in 2016.[9][1][10] He was the primary coder for the system's product suite since his time at PDI, when it was yet to be known as DreamWorks Animation Media Review System.\n\n\nThe suite was developed in an era of 56K modems to enable seamless collaboration between different artists and technicians in film-making. In Thakkur's words:- \"They wanted any artist to view to view any number of shots, back-to-back, from part of the film, in high resolution, at 24 fps, with high quality audio, with speed-change control, from any phase of production from any department (story, editing, animation, modeling, layout, lighting, vfx, etc.)...\"[1]\n\n\nAt PDI and DreamWorks, Thakkar worked on several films, including *Forces of Nature*, *Antz*, *The Legend of Bagger Vance*, *The Peacemaker* and *A Simple Wish*. He was also a member of the animation software development team for *Shrek*, which went on to win the first-ever Academy Award for Best Animated Feature at the 74th Academy Awards.[11]\n\n\nAfter leaving DreamWorks in 2002, Thakkar worked in PIXIA Corp from 2003 to 2013 as a Chief Architect and was the Vice President of Technology in the area of satellite imagery.[12] He then worked at Madison Square Garden from 2013 to 2014 as Vice President of Technology contributing in the entertainment, media and sports fields. Later, in 2014, he became the Vice President of R&D at Brivio Systems, a company operating in the access control industry.[12] Thakkar noted certain surveillance drones used in the rescue of Captain Philips (from Somalian pirates) ran on their software.[5] He left Brivio in 2015, and since then has been engaged with the aerospace industry, working for a Boeing subsidiary in the cloud-computing sector.[4][12]\n\n\nAt the time of winning the 2016 Academy Award, Thakkar had 25 patents in his name, including patents pending, and had also developed a web standard.[13][4]\n\n\n\n## 2016 Academy Award[edit]\n\n\nThakkar won the 2016 Academy Award for scientific and technical achievement for his \"groundbreaking design\"[a] of DreamWorks Animation Media Review System.[9][14] He was interviewed by six members of the Academy during the shortlisting process.[2] In a ceremony held on 13 February 2016 at Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Beverly Hills, California, Thakkar received the Academy Award jointly with Pacific Data Images' co-founder Richard Chuang.[10][7][15] As per the Academy, these set of awards are bestowed upon individuals who have contributed significantly over time (and not necessarily in the past year) to the motion picture industry.[9][16]\n\n\nThakkar commented in a January 2016 interview to *India-West*, \"It is quite humbling to be recognized by AMPAS (Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences) with a technical achievement award... It\u2019s a wonderful feeling to know that the work we did two decades ago was still in use by the film industry. I am honored to be sharing this award with Richard Chuang, a mentor and pioneer in visual effects.\"[5] He further revealed that he was excited about attending the award ceremony, additionally commenting that he expected more Indians to be featured in the Academy Awards winners' lists in the coming years.[2]\n\n\nThe award presenters noted Thakkar and Chuang's pioneer contributions in enabling stereoscopic 3D viewing for movies and especially over the film *Shrek.*[17][15] The Academy's award citation praised the DreamWork Animation Media Review System's film review capabilities, mentioning that the technology \"continues to provide artist-driven, integrated, consistent and highly scalable studio-wide playback and interactive reviews.\"[9]\n\n\n\n### Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** *As per the Academy's official notification*.\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of Indian winners and nominees of the Academy Awards\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** News.
