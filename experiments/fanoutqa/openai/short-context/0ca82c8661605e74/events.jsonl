T. Haig,[14] Norman R. Pogson,[15] and Lieutenant John Herschel,[16] and was subsequently confirmed by French astronomer Jules Janssen.[17] Janssen is often jointly credited with detecting the element, along with Norman Lockyer. Janssen recorded the helium spectral line during the solar eclipse of 1868, while Lockyer observed it from Britain. Lockyer was the first to propose that the line was due to a new element, which he named after the Sun. The formal discovery of the element was made in 1895 by chemists Sir William Ramsay, Per Teodor Cleve, and Nils Abraham Langlet, who found helium emanating from the uranium ore cleveite, which is now not regarded as a separate mineral species, but as a variety of uraninite.[18][19] In 1903, large reserves of helium were found in natural gas fields in parts of the United States, by far the largest supplier of the gas today.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn March 26, 1895, Scottish chemist Sir William Ramsay isolated helium on Earth by treating the mineral cleveite (a variety of uraninite with at least 10% rare-earth elements) with mineral acids. Ramsay was looking for argon but, after separating nitrogen and oxygen from the gas, liberated by sulfuric acid, he noticed a bright yellow line that matched the D3 line observed in the spectrum of the Sun.[28][33][34][35] These samples were identified as helium by Lockyer and British physicist William Crookes.[36][37] It was independently isolated from cleveite, in the same year, by chemists, Per Teodor Cleve and Abraham Langlet, in Uppsala, Sweden, who collected enough of the gas to accurately determine its atomic weight.[38][39][26][40] Helium was also isolated by the American geochemist, William Francis Hillebrand, prior to Ramsay's discovery, when he noticed unusual spectral lines while testing a sample of the mineral uraninite. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHillebrand, however, attributed the lines to nitrogen.[41] His letter of congratulations to Ramsay offers an interesting case of discovery, and near-discovery, in science.[42]\n\n\nIn 1907, Ernest Rutherford and Thomas Royds demonstrated that alpha particles are helium nuclei, by allowing the particles to penetrate the thin, glass wall of an evacuated tube, then creating a discharge in the tube, to study the spectrum of the new gas inside.[43] In 1908, helium was first liquefied by Dutch physicist Heike Kamerlingh Onnes by cooling the gas to less than 5 K (−268.15 °C; −450.67 °F).[44][45] He tried to solidify it, by further reducing the temperature, but failed, because helium does not solidify at atmospheric pressure. Onnes' student Willem Hendrik Keesom was eventually able to solidify 1 cm3 of helium in 1926 by applying additional external pressure.[46][47]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n28. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** ***k*** ***l*** ***m*** ***n*** ***o*** ***p*** ***q*** ***r*** ***s*** ***t*** ***u*** ***v*** ***w*** Hampel, Clifford A.

The line was detected by French astronomer Jules Janssen during a total solar eclipse in Guntur, India.[25][26] This line was initially assumed to be sodium. On October 20 of the same year, English astronomer, Norman Lockyer, observed a yellow line in the solar spectrum, which, he named the D3 because it was near the known D1 and D2 Fraunhofer lines of sodium.[27][28] He concluded that it was caused by an element in the Sun unknown on Earth.

Most terrestrial helium present today is created by the natural radioactive decay of heavy radioactive elements (thorium and uranium, although there are other examples), as the alpha particles emitted by such decays consist of helium-4 nuclei. This radiogenic helium is trapped with natural gas in concentrations as great as 7% by volume, from which it is extracted commercially by a low-temperature separation process called fractional distillation. Terrestrial helium is a non-renewable resource because once released into the atmosphere, it promptly escapes into space. Its supply is thought to be rapidly diminishing.[21][22] However, some studies suggest that helium produced deep in the Earth by radioactive decay can collect in natural gas reserves in larger-than-expected quantities,[23] in some cases having been released by volcanic activity.[24]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Scientific discoveries[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_rAxS98nc2xkr1yOZjk8l6joa","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

Currently, most beryllium is produced by reducing beryllium fluoride with magnesium.[73] The price on the American market for vacuum-cast beryllium ingots was about $338 per pound ($745 per kilogram) in 2001.[74]\n\n\nBetween 1998 and 2008, the world's production of beryllium had decreased from 343 to about 200 tonnes. It then increased to 230 tonnes by 2018, of which 170 tonnes came from the United States.[75][76]\n\n\n\n### Etymology[edit]\n\n\nNamed after beryl, a semiprecious mineral, from which it was first isolated.[77][78][79]\n\n\n\n## Applications[edit]\n\n\n### Radiation windows[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn a 1798 paper read before the Institut de France, Vauquelin reported that he found a new \"earth\" by dissolving aluminium hydroxide from emerald and beryl in an additional alkali.[62] The editors of the journal *Annales de Chimie et de Physique* named the new earth \"glucine\" for the sweet taste of some of its compounds.[63] Klaproth preferred the name \"beryllina\" due to the fact that yttria also formed sweet salts.[64][65] The name \"beryllium\" was first used by Wöhler in 1828.[66]\n\n\n\n![](image)Friedrich Wöhler was one of the men who independently isolated beryllium\nFriedrich Wöhler[67] and Antoine Bussy[68] independently isolated beryllium in 1828 by the chemical reaction of metallic potassium with beryllium chloride, as follows:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Beryllium** is a chemical element; it has symbol **Be** and atomic number 4. It is a steel-gray, strong, lightweight and brittle alkaline earth metal. It is a divalent element that occurs naturally only in combination with other elements to form minerals. Gemstones high in beryllium include beryl (aquamarine, emerald, red beryl) and chrysoberyl. It is a relatively rare element in the universe, usually occurring as a product of the spallation of larger atomic nuclei that have collided with cosmic rays. Within the cores of stars, beryllium is depleted as it is fused into heavier elements. Beryllium constitutes about 0.0004 percent by mass of Earth's crust. The world's annual beryllium production of 220 tons is usually manufactured by extraction from the mineral beryl, a difficult process because beryllium bonds strongly to oxygen.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Standard Atomic Weights: Beryllium\".

In 1766–1781, Henry Cavendish was the first to recognize that hydrogen gas was a discrete substance[15] and that it produces water when burned, the property for which it was later named: in Greek, hydrogen means \"water-former\".\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1766, Henry Cavendish was the first to recognize hydrogen gas as a discrete substance, by naming the gas from a metal-acid reaction \"inflammable air\". He speculated that \"inflammable air\" was in fact identical to the hypothetical substance called \"phlogiston\"[80][81] and further finding in 1781 that the gas produces water when burned. He is usually given credit for the discovery of hydrogen as an element.[7][8] In 1783, Antoine Lavoisier gave the element the name hydrogen (from the Greek ὑδρο- *hydro* meaning \"water\" and -γενής *genes* meaning \"former\")[82] when he and Laplace reproduced Cavendish's finding that water is produced when hydrogen is burned.[8]\n\n\n\n![](image)Antoine-Laurent de Lavoisier\nLavoisier produced hydrogen for his experiments on mass conservation by reacting a flux of steam with metallic iron through an incandescent iron tube heated in a fire. Anaerobic oxidation of iron by the protons of water at high temperature can be schematically represented by the set of following reactions:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n1) Fe + H2O → FeO + H2\n2) Fe + 3 H2O → Fe2O3 + 3 H2\n3) Fe + 4 H2O → Fe3O4 + 4 H2\nMany metals such as zirconium undergo a similar reaction with water leading to the production of hydrogen.\n\n\nHydrogen was liquefied for the first time by James Dewar in 1898 by using regenerative cooling and his invention, the vacuum flask.[8] He produced solid hydrogen the next year.[8] Deuterium was discovered in December 1931 by Harold Urey, and tritium was prepared in 1934 by Ernest Rutherford, Mark Oliphant, and Paul Harteck.[7] Heavy water, which consists of deuterium in the place of regular hydrogen, was discovered by Urey's group in 1932.[8] François Isaac de Rivaz built the first de Rivaz engine, an internal combustion engine powered by a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen in 1806. Edward Daniel Clarke invented the hydrogen gas blowpipe in 1819. The Döbereiner's lamp and limelight were invented in 1823.[8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n77. **^** Winter, M.

It is a soft, silvery-white alkali metal. Under standard conditions, it is the least dense metal and the least dense solid element. Like all alkali metals, lithium is highly reactive and flammable, and must be stored in vacuum, inert atmosphere, or inert liquid such as purified kerosene or mineral oil. It exhibits a metallic luster. It corrodes quickly in air to a dull silvery gray, then black tarnish. It does not occur freely in nature, but occurs mainly as pegmatitic minerals, which were once the main source of lithium. Due to its solubility as an ion, it is present in ocean water and is commonly obtained from brines.
