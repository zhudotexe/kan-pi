The ranking was based upon assets as reported and was not adjusted for different accounting treatments.[2] Another publication which has the goal to compile a yearly list of the world largest banks is The Banker Magazine. Every year in their July number a list of the World 1000 Largest Banks is published.[3] The financial data published by the July yearly issue of The Banker are much more extensive compared to the S&P Top 100 banks, but it's not a publication intended for the general public.\n\n\nAccounting treatment affects the assets reported: for example, the United States uses US GAAP (as opposed to IFRS), which only reports the net derivative position in most cases, leading to US banks having fewer derivative assets than comparable non-US banks.[4] If JPMorgan Chase reported under the IFRS, it would be ranked 2nd on the list as of 2023[update], rather than 5th.[2]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Rank\n | Bank name\n | Total assets(2022)(US$ billion)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | ![China](image) Industrial and

On July 10, 1951, two banks of the Republic of China, Farmers Bank of China and Cooperation Bank, merged to form the Agricultural Cooperation Bank, which ABC regards as its ancestor. However, the bank was merged into People's Bank of China, the central bank in 1952. The first bank bearing the name Agricultural Bank of China was founded in 1955, but it was merged into the central bank in 1957. In 1963 the Chinese government formed another agricultural bank which was also merged into the central bank two years later. Today's Agricultural Bank of China was founded in February 1979. As the People's Bank of China began spinning off its commercial banking functions after 1978, ABC's focus on providing farmers with financial services increased.[10]:\u200a225\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAgricultural Bank of China| ![](image) |\n| ![](image)Headquarters in Beijing, China\n |\n| Native name\n | \u4e2d\u56fd\u519c\u4e1a\u94f6\u884c |\n| Company type | Public |\n| Traded as\n | * SSE: 601288 (A ordinary)\n* SSE: 360001 (A preference 1)\n* SSE: 360008 (A preference 2)\n* SEHK:\u00a01288 (H ordinary)\n |\n| ISIN | * CNE100000RJ0\n* CNE100000Q43\n |\n| Industry | Financial services |\n| Founded | 10\u00a0July 1951; 72 years ago\u00a0(1951-07-10) |\n| Headquarters | Beijing, China |\n| Key people\n | Zhao Huan (President) |\n| Products | Finance and insurance, consumer banking, corporate banking, investment banking, investment management, global wealth management, private equity, mortgages, credit cards |\n| Revenue | ![Increase](image) CN\u00a5602.56 billion$153.9 billion (2020)[1][2] |\n| Operating income\n | ![Increase](image) CN\u00a5251.67 billion$36,6 billion (2018)[1] |\n| Net income\n | ![Increase](image) CN\u00a5202.63 billion$29.5 billion (2018)[1] |\n| Total assets | ![Increase](image) CN\u00a522.609 trillion$3.286 trillion (2018)[1] |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nABC was the last of the \"big four\" banks in China to go public. In 2010, A shares and H shares of Agricultural Bank of China were listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange respectively. Each share was set to cost between 2.7RMB and 3.3RMB per share.[17] H shares were set to cost between HK$2.88 and HK$3.48 per share.[18] The final share price for the IPO launch was issued on July 7, 2010. On completion in August 2010 it became the world's biggest initial public offering (IPO) surpassing the one set by Industrial and Commercial Bank of China in 2006 of US$21.9 billion.[19] This record has since been beaten by another Chinese company, Alibaba, in 2014.[20]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n8. **^** \"Forbes' 13th Annual Global 2000: The World's Biggest Public Companies\". 6 May 2015.

It has been the second oldest bank in China still in existence after the Bank of Communications, founded in 1908. From its establishment until 1942, it issued banknotes on behalf of the Government along with the \"Big Four\" banks of the period: the Farmers Bank of China, Bank of Communications and Central Bank of the Republic of China. After the People's Republic was established in 1949, it has become a national commercial and foreign exchange professional bank. Its original central bank designation was carried on by the newly formed People's Bank of China.[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n16. **^** \"The World's Biggest Public Companies\". *Forbes*.
