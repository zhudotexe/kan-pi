Beginning in the early 20th century, many justices who left the Court voluntarily did so by retiring from the Court without leaving the federal judiciary altogether. A retired justice, according to the United States Code, is no longer a member of the Supreme Court, but remains eligible to serve by designation as a judge of a U.S. Court of Appeals or District Court, and many retired justices have served in these capacities. Historically, the average length of service on the Court has been less than 15 years. However, since 1970 the average length of service has increased to about 26 years.[8]\n\n\n\n## List of justices[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSince the Supreme Court was established in 1789, 116 people have served on the Court. The length of service on the Court for the 107 non-incumbent justices ranges from William O. Douglas's 36 years, 209 days to John Rutledge's 1 year, 18 days as associate justice and, separated by a period of years off the Court, his 138 days as chief justice. As of June 13, 2024, the length of service for the nine incumbent justices ranges from Clarence Thomas's 32 years, 234 days to Ketanji Brown Jackson's 1 year, 349 days. Five individuals, who were confirmed for associate justice, were later appointed chief justice separately: John Rutledge,[a] Edward Douglass White,[b] Charles Evans Hughes,[a] Harlan F. Stone[b] and William Rehnquist.[b] While listed twice, each of them has been assigned only one index number.

Alumni also include current United States Supreme Court associate justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Sonia Sotomayor and Brett Kavanaugh, as well as a number of former justices, including Abe Fortas, Potter Stewart and Byron White; several heads of state, including German President Karl Carstens, President of the Philippines Jose P. Laurel, and Peter Mutharika, the immediate former president of Malawi; six current U.S. senators; the former governor of California and immediate former governor of Rhode Island and current United States Secretary of Commerce; and the current deans of four of the top fourteen-ranked law schools in the United States: Penn, Virginia, Northwestern, and Georgetown.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nLaw schools in New England\n |\n| --- |\n| Connecticut | * University of Connecticut School of Law\n* Quinnipiac University School of Law\n* Yale Law School\n |\n| Maine | * University of Maine School of Law\n |\n| Massachusetts | * Boston College Law School\n* Boston University School of Law\n* Harvard Law School\n* University of Massachusetts School of Law\n* Massachusetts School of Law\n* New England School of Law\n* Northeastern University School of Law\n* Southern New England School of Law (closed)\n* Suffolk University Law School\n* Western New England University School of Law\n |\n| New Hampshire | * University of New Hampshire School of Law\n |\n| Rhode Island | * Roger Williams University School of Law\n |\n| Vermont | * Vermont Law School\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Ralph K.
