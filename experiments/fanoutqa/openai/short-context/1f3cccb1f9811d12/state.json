Eight national parks (including six in Alaska) are paired with a national preserve, areas with different levels of protection that are administered together but considered separate units and whose areas are not included in the figures below. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFourteen national parks are designated UNESCO World Heritage Sites (WHS),[6] and 21 national parks are named UNESCO Biosphere Reserves (BR),[7] with eight national parks in both programs.\n\n\nThirty states have national parks, as do the territories of American Samoa and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The state with the most national parks is California with nine, followed by Alaska with eight, Utah with five, and Colorado with four. The largest national park is Wrangell\u2013St. Elias in Alaska: at over 8\u00a0million acres (32,375\u00a0km2), it is larger than each of the nine smallest states. The next three largest parks are also in Alaska. The smallest park is Gateway Arch National Park, Missouri, at 192.83 acres (0.7804\u00a0km2). The total area protected by national parks is approximately 52.4\u00a0million acres (212,000\u00a0km2), for an average of 833\u00a0thousand acres (3,370\u00a0km2) but a median of only 220\u00a0thousand acres (890\u00a0km2).[8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

In cities like Fort Lauderdale, Miami, Key West, Naples, and Palm Beach average daily highs range from the mid 70\u00a0\u00b0F (21\u00a0\u00b0C)s in winter to near 90\u00a0\u00b0F (32-33\u00a0\u00b0C) in summer. Average overnight lows range from the upper 50\u00a0\u00b0F (10\u00a0\u00b0C)s in winter to the mid and upper 70\u00a0\u00b0F (21\u00a0\u00b0C)s in summer. Southern Florida is the warmest region of the U.S. mainland in winter.\n\n\n\n### Southern Plains/Lower Midwest/Middle East Coast/Mid-Atlantic[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe northern half of the Great Plains (Nebraska northward), Midwest, Great Lakes, and New England states have a variety of humid continental climates, and the western plains have a semi-arid climate. Here there are four distinct seasons, with warm to hot summers, and cold and often-snowy winters. Average daily high temperatures range from 10\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221212\u00a0\u00b0C) (in North Dakota, and central and northern Minnesota) to 30\u00a0\u00b0F (\u22121\u00a0\u00b0C) in winter to 70 to 80\u00a0\u00b0F (21 to 27\u00a0\u00b0C)s in summer, while overnight lows range from below 0\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221218\u00a0\u00b0C) in winter (in North Dakota and much of Minnesota) to 50 to 60\u00a0\u00b0F (10 to 16\u00a0\u00b0C) in summer. In the New England states, precipitation is evenly distributed around the year, with a slight late fall-early winter (November\u2013December) maximum along the New England coast from Boston northward due to intense early-winter storms. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)\nIn recent decades, record high daily temperatures have predominated over record daily low temperatures, with record daily highs now numbering more than twice that of record daily lows.[18]\n![](image)\nThe 20-year average of the number of annual Category 4 and 5 hurricanes in the Atlantic region has approximately doubled since the year 2000.[19]\n\n![](image)North Atlantic tropical storms and hurricanes Hurricane category 4-5\n Hurricane category 1-3\n Tropical storm or Tropical depression\n\nIn northern Alaska, tundra and arctic conditions predominate, and the temperature has fallen as low as \u221280\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221262\u00a0\u00b0C).[20] On the other end of the spectrum, Death Valley, California once reached 134\u00a0\u00b0F (56.7\u00a0\u00b0C), officially the highest temperature ever recorded on Earth.[21]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
