Teams were scheduled to play 10 games against each of their four division opponents. The remaining 20 games of the 60-game schedule were interleague contests. To reduce travel, the interleague division match-ups were AL East vs NL East, AL Central vs NL Central, and AL West vs NL West.[9] At 60 games, this was the shortest regular season since 1878.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThis article is about the 2020 Major League Baseball season only.

The start of the season was delayed by a lockout of players, which commenced on December 2, 2021, following the expiration of the collective bargaining agreement (CBA) between the league and the Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA).[2] On March 10, 2022, MLB and the MLBPA reached a deal on a five-year CBA, with Opening Day being held on April 7 (delayed from its originally planned March 31), and a full 162-game schedule played. Under the new CBA, universal designated hitter was adopted, and the postseason was expanded to 12 teams. In November 2021, the Cleveland Indians announced their new team name, the Cleveland Guardians.[3] The 2022 MLB All-Star Game was held on July 19 and hosted by the Los Angeles Dodgers at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles.[4]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMajor League Baseball released its 2022 regular season schedule on August 4, 2021.
