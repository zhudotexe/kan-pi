Claims that the first true flight occurred after 1903 are made for Traian Vuia and Alberto Santos-Dumont. Supporters of the post-Wright pioneers argue that techniques used by the Wright brothers disqualify them as first to make successful airplane flights.[141] Those techniques were: A launch rail; skids instead of wheels; a headwind at takeoff; and a catapult after 1903. Supporters of the Wright brothers argue that proven, repeated, controlled, and sustained flights by the brothers entitle them to credit as inventors of the airplane, regardless of those techniques.[142]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Wright brothers' status as inventors of the airplane has been subject to counter-claims by various parties. Much controversy persists over the many competing claims of early aviators. Edward Roach, historian for the Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park, argues that they were excellent self-taught engineers who could run a small company, but they did not have the business skills or temperament to dominate the growing aviation industry.[17]\n\n\n\n\n## Childhood[edit]\n\n\n![Orville](image)\n![Wilbur](image)\nOrville (left) and Wilbur Wright as children in 1876\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\npatent did not claim invention of a flying machine, but rather a system of aerodynamic control that manipulated a flying machine's surfaces.[14]\n\n\nThe brothers gained the mechanical skills essential to their success by working for years in their Dayton, Ohio-based shop with printing presses, bicycles, motors, and other machinery. Their work with bicycles, in particular, influenced their belief that an unstable vehicle such as a flying machine could be controlled and balanced with practice.[13]:\u200a169 This was a trend, as many other aviation pioneers were also dedicated cyclists and involved in the bicycle business in various ways.[15] From 1900 until their first powered flights in late 1903, the brothers conducted extensive glider tests that also developed their skills as pilots. Their shop mechanic Charles Taylor became an important part of the team, building their first airplane engine in close collaboration with the brothers.[16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Wright brothers\n |\n| --- |\n| ![Orville Wright in 1905](image)\n![Wilbur Wright in 1905](image)\nOrville (left) and Wilbur Wright in 1905\n |\n| Nationality | American |\n| Other\u00a0names | * Will and Orv\n* The Bishop's boys\n |\n| Known\u00a0for | Inventing, building, and flying the world's first successful motor-operated airplane, the *Wright Flyer*; pioneering the use of flight control systems for fixed-wing aircraft |\n| Parents | * Milton Wright\n* Susan Catherine Koerner Wright\n |\n| Relatives | Katharine Wright (sister) |\n| **Orville Wright** |\n| Born | (1871-08-19)August 19, 1871Dayton, Ohio, U.S. |\n| Died | January 30, 1948(1948-01-30) (aged\u00a076)Dayton, Ohio, U.S. |\n| Cause of death | Heart attack[1] |\n| Education | 3 years high school |\n| Occupation | Printer / publisher, bicycle retailer / manufacturer, airplane inventor / manufacturer, pilot trainer |\n| Signature | ![Signature of Orville Wright](image) |\n|  |\n| **Wilbur Wright** |\n| Born | (1867-04-16)April 16, 1867Millville, Indiana, U.S. |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Died | May 30, 1912(1912-05-30) (aged\u00a045)Dayton, Ohio, U.S. |\n| Cause of death | Typhoid fever[2] |\n| Education | 4 years high school |\n| Occupation | Editor, bicycle retailer / manufacturer, airplane inventor / manufacturer, pilot trainer |\n| Signature | ![Signature of Wilbur Wright](image) |\n|  |\n\n\nThe **Wright brothers**, **Orville Wright** (August 19, 1871 \u2013 January 30, 1948) and **Wilbur Wright** (April 16, 1867 \u2013 May 30, 1912), were American aviation pioneers generally credited with inventing, building, and flying the world's first successful motor-operated airplane.[3][4][5] They made the first controlled, sustained flight of a powered, heavier-than-air aircraft with the *Wright Flyer* on December 17, 1903, four miles (6 km) south of Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, at what is now known as Kill Devil Hills. The brothers were also the first to invent aircraft controls that made fixed-wing powered flight possible. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |\n| --- |\n| The original Wright brothers aeroplane\nThe world's first power-driven heavier-than-air machine in which man made free, controlled, and sustained flight\nInvented and built by Wilbur and Orville Wright\nFlown by them at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina December 17, 1903\nBy original scientific research the Wright brothers discovered the principles of human flight\nAs inventors, builders, and flyers they further developed the aeroplane, taught man to fly, and opened the era of aviation\n |\n\n\n## Later years[edit]\n\n\n### Wilbur[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 1904\u20131905, the Wright brothers developed their flying machine to make longer-running and more aerodynamic flights with the Wright Flyer II, followed by the first truly practical fixed-wing aircraft, the Wright Flyer III. The brothers' breakthrough was their creation of a three-axis control system, which enabled the pilot to steer the aircraft effectively and to maintain its equilibrium.[6][7][8][9] This method remains standard on fixed-wing aircraft of all kinds.[10][11]:\u200a183 From the beginning of their aeronautical work, Wilbur and Orville focused on developing a reliable method of pilot control as the key to solving \"the flying problem\". This approach differed significantly from other experimenters of the time who put more emphasis on developing powerful engines.[12] Using a small home-built wind tunnel, the Wrights also collected more accurate data than any before, enabling them to design more efficient wings and propellers.[11]:\u200a156[13]:\u200a228 Their first U.S. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAviation historian C.H. Gibbs-Smith stated a number of times[107][108] that the Wrights' legal victory would have been \"doubtful\" if an 1868 patent of \"a prior but lost invention\" by M.P.W. Boulton of the U.K. had been known in the period 1903\u20131906.[100][109][110] The patent, titled *A\u00ebrial Locomotion &c,* described several engine improvements and conceptual designs and included a technical description and drawings of an aileron control system and an optional feature intended to function as an autopilot.[111][112] In fact, this patent was well known to participants in the Wright-Curtiss lawsuit. A U.S. federal judge who reviewed previous inventions and patents and upheld the Wright patent against the Curtiss company reached the opposite conclusion of Gibbs-Smith, saying the Boulton patent \"is not anticipatory\".[113]\n\n\n\n### Public reactions[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The Wright Brothers' U.S. Patent 821,393 issued 1906\nThe Wright brothers wrote their 1903 patent application themselves, but it was rejected. In January 1904, they hired Ohio patent attorney Henry Toulmin, and on May 22, 1906, they were granted U.S. Patent 821393[14] for \"new and useful Improvements in Flying Machines\".\n\n\nThe patent illustrates a non-powered flying machine \u2013 namely, the 1902 glider. The patent's importance lies in its claim of a new and useful method of *controlling* a flying machine, powered or not. The technique of wing-warping is described, but the patent explicitly states that other methods instead of wing-warping could be used for adjusting the outer portions of a machine's wings to different angles on the right and left sides to achieve lateral (roll) control.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1896 brought three important aeronautical events. In May, Smithsonian Institution Secretary Samuel Langley successfully flew an unmanned steam-powered fixed-wing model aircraft. In mid-year, Chicago engineer and aviation authority Octave Chanute brought together several men who tested various types of gliders over the sand dunes along the shore of Lake Michigan. In August, Lilienthal was killed in the plunge of his glider.[28] These events lodged in the minds of the brothers, especially Lilienthal's death. The Wright brothers later cited his death as the point when their serious interest in flight research began.[29]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGlenn Curtiss and other early aviators devised ailerons to emulate lateral control described in the patent and demonstrated by the Wrights in their public flights.\nSoon after the historic July 4, 1908, one-kilometer flight by Curtiss in the AEA June Bug, the Wrights warned him not to infringe their patent by profiting from flying or selling aircraft that used ailerons.\n\n\nOrville wrote Curtiss, \"Claim 14 of our patent no. 821,393, specifically covers the combination which we are informed you are using. If it is your desire to enter the exhibition business, we would be glad to take up the matter of a license to operate under our patent for that purpose.\"[36]:\u200a269\u2013270\n\n\nCurtiss was at the time a member of the Aerial Experiment Association (AEA), headed by Alexander Graham Bell, where in 1908 he had helped reinvent wingtip ailerons for their Aerodrome No. 2, known as the AEA White Wing[100][101][e]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe concept of varying the angle presented to the air near the wingtips, by any suitable method, is central to the patent. The patent also describes the steerable rear vertical rudder and its innovative use in combination with wing-warping, enabling the airplane to make a *coordinated turn*, a technique that prevents hazardous *adverse yaw*, the problem Wilbur had when trying to turn the 1901 glider. Finally, the patent describes the forward elevator, used for ascending and descending.\n\n\nIn March 1904, the Wright Brothers applied for French and German patents. The French patent was granted on July 1, 1904. According to Combs, regarding the U.S. patent, \"... by 1906 the drawings in the Wright patents were available to anyone who wanted badly enough to get them. And they gave proof \u2013 in vivid, technical detail \u2013 of how to get into the air.\"[36]:\u200a244,\u200a257\u2013258\n\n\n\n### Lawsuits begin[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nS.P. Langley, secretary of the Smithsonian Institution from 1887 until his death in 1906, experimented for years with model flying machines and successfully flew unmanned powered fixed-wing model aircraft in 1896 and 1903. Two tests of his manned full-size motor-driven Aerodrome in October and December\u00a01903, however, were complete failures. Nevertheless, the Smithsonian later proudly displayed the Aerodrome in its museum as the first heavier-than-air craft \"capable\" of manned powered flight, relegating the Wright brothers' invention to secondary status and triggering a decades-long feud with Orville Wright, whose brother had received help from the Smithsonian when beginning his own quest for flight.[f]\n\n\nThe Smithsonian based its claim for the Aerodrome on short test flights Glenn Curtiss and his team made with it in 1914. The Smithsonian had allowed Curtiss to make major modifications to the craft before attempting to fly it.[120]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAsh, Robert L.; Britcher, Colin P.; Hyde, Kenneth W.

A personal computer is one intended for interactive individual use, as opposed to a mainframe computer where the end user's requests are filtered through operating staff, or a time sharing system in which one large processor is shared by many individuals. After the development of the microprocessor, individual personal computers were low enough in cost that they eventually became affordable consumer goods. Early personal computers \u2013 generally called microcomputers \u2013 were sold often in electronic kit form and in limited numbers, and were of interest mostly to hobbyists and technicians.\n\n\n\n### Mainframes, minicomputers, and microcomputers[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n100. **^** \"Computers in use pass 1 billion mark: Gartner\". *Reuters*. 23 June 2008.

Like the Apple II and S-100 systems, it was based on an open, card-based architecture, which allowed third parties to develop for it. It used the Intel 8088 CPU running at 4.77\u00a0MHz, containing 29,000 transistors. The first model used an audio cassette for external storage, though there was an expensive floppy disk option. The cassette option was never popular and was removed in the PC XT of 1983.[75] The XT added a 10 MB hard drive in place of one of the two floppy disks and increased the number of expansion slots from 5 to 8. While the original PC design could accommodate only up to 64 KB on the main board, the architecture was able to accommodate up to 640 KB of RAM, with the rest on cards. Later revisions of the design increased the limit to 256 KB on the main board.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n41. **^** Schuyten, Peter J.

He is a pioneer in the wireless communications industry, especially in radio spectrum management, with eleven patents in the field.[2][3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn April 3, 1973, he placed the first public call from a handheld portable cell phone while working at Motorola, from a Manhattan sidewalk to his counterpart at competitor Bell Labs.\n[4][5]\nCooper reprised the first handheld cellular mobile phone (distinct from the car phone) in 1973 and led the team that re-developed it and brought it to market in 1983.[6][7] He is considered the \"father of the (handheld) cell phone\".[2][6][8][9]\n\n\nCooper is co-founder of numerous communications companies with his wife and business partner Arlene Harris;[10] He is co-founder and current Chairman of Dyna LLC, in Del Mar, California. Cooper also sits on committees supporting the U.S. Federal Communications Commission[11] and the United States Department of Commerce.\n\n\nIn 2010, Cooper was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering for leadership in the creation and deployment of the cellular portable hand-held telephone.\n\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBy the early 1970s, Cooper headed Motorola's communications systems division.[4] Here he conceived of the first portable cellular phone in 1973 and led the 10-year process of bringing it to market.[8] Car phones had been in limited use in large U.S. cities since the 1930s but Cooper championed cellular telephony for more general personal, portable communications.[17] He believed the cellular phone should be a \"personal telephone \u2013 something that would represent an individual so you could assign a number; not to a place, not to a desk, not to a home, but to a person.\"[4] Although it has been stated that Cooper's vision for the device was inspired by Captain James T. Kirk using his Communicator on the television show Star Trek,[18] Cooper himself later said that his actual inspiration was Dick Tracy's wrist radio.[19]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCooper is the lead inventor named on \"radio telephone system\" filed on October 17, 1973, with the U.S. Patent Office and later issued as U.S. Patent 3,906,166.[22] John Francis Mitchell, Motorola's Chief of Portable Communication Products (and Cooper's Manager and Mentor) and the engineers who worked for Cooper and Mitchell are also named on the patent.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn April 3, 1973, Cooper and Mitchell demonstrated two working phones to the media and to passers-by prior to walking into a scheduled press conference at the New York City Hilton in midtown Manhattan. Standing on Sixth avenue near the Hilton, Cooper made the first handheld cellular phone call in public from the prototype DynaTAC. The call connected him to a base station Motorola had installed on the roof of the Burlington House (now the AllianceBernstein Building) and into the AT&T land-line telephone system.[15] Reporters and onlookers watched as Cooper dialed the number of his chief competitor Dr. Joel S. Engel at AT&T.[23] \"Joel, this is Marty. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n22. **^** Cooper, Martin *et al.* \"All Signaling\" U.S. patent 3,906,166, Issued September 1, 1975\n23. ^ ***a*** ***b*** April 3, 1973: Motorola Calls AT&T...by Cell, Wired, April 3, 2008\n24. **^** Twitter, Telegram and Email: Famous First Lines, BBC News, March 21, 2011\n25. **^** Cooper's Calling, ITP Net, April 21, 2010\n26. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Antennas Get Smart, Scientific American, June 9, 2003\n27. **^** Review, Technology. \"Everyone Is Wrong\". *MIT Technology Review*.\n28. **^** \"They're Accomplished, They're Famous, and They're MENSANS\". *Mensa Bulletin* (476).

He also led the creation of trunked mobile radio, quartz crystals, oscillators, liquid crystal displays, piezo-electric components, Motorola A. M. stereo technology and various mobile and portable two-way radio product lines.\n\n\nCooper rose to Vice-President and Corporate Director of Research and Development at Motorola.[2] In addition to his work on the mobile cellular phone, he was instrumental in expanding the technology of pagers from use within a single building to use across multiple cities.[8] Cooper also worked with inventor Clifford L. Rose to fix a flaw in quartz crystals used in Motorola's radios which encouraged the company to mass-produce the first crystals used in wrist watches.[8]\n\n\n\n### Cellular Business Systems[edit]\n\n\n### Dyna LLC[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCooper left his first job at Teletype Corporation in Chicago in 1954 and joined Motorola, Inc. (Schaumburg, Illinois) as a senior development engineer in the mobile equipment group. He developed products including the first cellular-like portable handheld police radio system, produced for the Chicago police department in 1967.\n[15][16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTop management at Motorola supported Cooper's mobile phone concept, investing $100\u00a0million between 1973 and 1993 before any revenues were realized.[20] Cooper assembled a team that designed and assembled a product in less than 90 days. That original handset, called the DynaTAC 8000x (DYNamic Adaptive Total Area Coverage) weighed 2.5 pounds (1.1\u00a0kg), measured 10 inches (25\u00a0cm) long and was dubbed \"the brick\" or \"the shoe\" phone.[21] A very substantial part of the DynaTAC was the battery, which weighed four to five times more than a modern cell phone.[7] The phone had only 30 minutes of talk time before requiring a 10-hour recharge but according to Cooper, \"The battery lifetime wasn't really a problem because you couldn't hold that phone up for that long!\" By 1983 and after four iterations, the handset was reduced to half its original weight.\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

On 3 April 1973, Martin Cooper, a Motorola researcher and executive, made the first mobile telephone call from handheld subscriber equipment, placing a call to Dr. Joel S. Engel of Bell Labs, his rival.[31][32][33] The prototype handheld phone used by Dr. Cooper weighed 2 kilograms (4.4\u00a0lb) and measured 23 by 13 by 4.5 centimetres (9.1 by 5.1 by 1.8\u00a0in). The prototype offered a talk time of just 30 minutes and took 10 hours to re-charge.[34] Commonly referred to as \u201cthe Brick,\u201d it was not commercially launched until October 1983,[35] and only then in the U.S.\n\n\nJohn F. Mitchell,[36][37][38] Motorola's chief of portable communication products and Cooper's boss in 1973, played a key role in advancing the development of handheld mobile telephone equipment. Mitchell successfully pushed Motorola to develop wireless communication products that would be small enough to use anywhere and participated in the design of the cellular phone.[39][40]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n16. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Gow, Gordon A. & Smith, Richard K.

One base station, connected to one telephone wire line, could serve up to six customers.[28]\n\n\nOne of the first successful public commercial mobile phone networks was the ARP network in Finland, launched in 1971. Posthumously, ARP is sometimes viewed as a *zero generation* (0G) cellular network, being slightly above previous proprietary and limited coverage networks.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Handheld mobile phone[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Martin Cooper photographed in 2007 with his 1972 handheld mobile phone prototype.\nPrior to 1973, mobile telephony was limited to phones installed in cars and other vehicles.[22] The first portable cellular phone commercially available for use on a cellular network was developed by E.F. Johnson and Millicom, Inc.[29] It was introduced by Millicom subsidiary Comvik in Sweden in September 1981.[30]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the United States, engineers from Bell Labs began work on a system to allow mobile users to place and receive telephone calls from automobiles, leading to the inauguration of mobile service on 17 June 1946 in St. Louis, Missouri. Shortly after, AT&T offered *Mobile Telephone Service*. A wide range of mostly incompatible mobile-telephone services offered limited coverage areas and only a few available channels in urban areas. As calls were transmitted as unencrypted analog signals, anyone with radio equipment that could receive those frequencies could eavesdrop. The commercial introduction (in Japan in 1979) of cellular technology, which allowed re-use of frequencies many times in small adjacent areas covered by relatively low-powered transmitters, made widespread adoption of mobile telephones economically feasible.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n37. **^** \"The Top Giants in Telephony\". *History of the Cell Phone.com*. 11 June 2009.

Enabling technology for mobile phones was first developed in the 1940s but it was not until the mid-1980s that they became widely available. By 2011, it was estimated in Britain that more calls were made using mobile phones than wired devices.[1]\nThe **history of mobile phones** covers mobile communication devices that connect wirelessly to the public switched telephone network.\n\n\nWhile the transmission of speech by signal has a long history, the first devices that were wireless, mobile, and also capable of connecting to the standard telephone network are much more recent. The first such devices were barely portable compared to today's compact hand-held devices, and their use was clumsy.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Wallop, Harry (18 June 2011). \"Mobile phone calls overtake landline calls for first time\". *The Daily Telegraph*.

Sasson** (born July 4, 1950) is an American electrical engineer and the inventor of the *self-contained* (portable) digital camera. He joined Kodak shortly after his graduation from engineering school and retired from Kodak in 2009.[1]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nSasson was born in Brooklyn, New York, the son of Ragnhild Tomine (Endresen) and John Vincent Sasson. His mother was Norwegian.[2]\n\n\nHe attended and graduated from Brooklyn Technical High School.[3] He is a 1972 (BS) and 1973 (MS) graduate of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in electrical engineering.[1]\n\n\n\n## First self-contained digital camera[edit]\n\n\nSteven Sasson developed a portable, battery operated, self-contained digital camera at Kodak in 1975.[4] It weighed 8 pounds (3.6\u00a0kg) and used a Fairchild CCD image sensor having only 100\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0100 pixels (0.01 megapixels). The images were digitally recorded onto a cassette tape, a process that took 23 seconds per image. His camera took images in black-and-white. As he set out on his design project, what he envisioned for the future was a camera without mechanical moving parts (although his device did have moving parts, such as the tape drive).[5]\n\n\nIn 1977, Kodak filed a patent application on some features of Sasson's prototype camera. Titled \"electronic still camera\", the patent listed Sasson and Gareth Llyod as co-inventors. The issued patent, U.S. patent number 4,131,919.[6] claims an arrangement that allows the CCD to be read out quickly (\"in real time\") into a temporary buffer of random-access memory, and then written to storage at the lower speed of the storage device. Most modern digital cameras still use such an arrangement, which was also described in an earlier MIT patent[7] that employed a vidicon sensor rather than a CCD.\n\n\nHis prototype was not the first camera that produced digital images, but it was the first hand-held digital camera.[4] Earlier examples of digital cameras included the Multi Spectral Scanner on Landsat 1,[8] which took digital photographs of Yosemite before it was launched in 1972, as well as cameras used for astronomical photography,[9] experimental devices by Michael Francis Tompsett *et al.*, and the commercial product and hobbyist camera called the Cromemco Cyclops.\n\n\n\n## Life and career[edit]\n\n\nHis work on digital cameras began in 1975 with a broad assignment from his supervisor at Eastman Kodak Company, Gareth A. Lloyd: to attempt to build an electronic camera using a commercially available charge coupled device (CCD).[10] The resulting camera invention was awarded the U.S. patent number 4,131,919.[6]\n\n\nSasson retired from Eastman Kodak Company in 2009, and began working as a consultant in an intellectual property protection role.[10] Sasson joined the University of South Florida Institute for Advanced Discovery & Innovation in 2018, where he is a member and courtesy professor.[11]\n\n\nOn November 17, 2009, U.S. President Barack Obama awarded Sasson the National Medal of Technology and Innovation at a ceremony in the East Room of the White House.[12] This is the highest honor awarded by the US government to scientists, engineers, and inventors.[13] On September 6, 2012 The Royal Photographic Society awarded Sasson its Progress Medal and Honorary Fellowship \"in recognition of any invention, research, publication or other contribution that has resulted in an important advance in the scientific or technological development of photography or imaging in the widest sense.\"[14]\n\n\nLeica Camera AG honored Sasson by presenting to him a limited edition 18-megapixel Leica M9 Titanium camera at the Photokina 2010 trade show event.[15]\n\n\nSasson was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2011, and later elected as a Fellow of the National Academy of Inventors in 2018.[16]\n\n\n\n## Patents[edit]\n\n\n* U.S. patent 4,131,919 Patent \u2013 Electronic Still camera\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"The Rediff Interview/Steven J Sasson, inventor of the digital camera\".
