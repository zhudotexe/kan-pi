K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson.\n\nIn April 2021, Molina confirmed that he was appearing in the film, explaining that he had been told not to talk about his role in the film during production but he realized that his appearance had been widely rumored and reported on.[26] Later that month, J. B. Smoove revealed that he was returning as Julius Dell from *Far From Home*,[46] while Cox stated that he was not involved with the film.[115] In early May, Garfield denied that he had been asked to appear in the film, but later said \"never say never\",[116][117] while Angourie Rice was revealed to be returning as Betty Brant.[43] Later that month, Stone denied her involvement in the film.[118]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n***Spider-Man: No Way Home*** is a 2021 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character Spider-Man, co-produced by Columbia Pictures and Marvel Studios, and distributed by Sony Pictures Releasing. It is the sequel to *Spider-Man: Homecoming* (2017) and *Spider-Man: Far From Home* (2019), and the 27th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film was directed by Jon Watts and written by Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers. It stars Tom Holland as Peter Parker / Spider-Man alongside Zendaya, Benedict Cumberbatch, Jacob Batalon, Jon Favreau, Jamie Foxx, Willem Dafoe, Alfred Molina, Benedict Wong, Tony Revolori, Marisa Tomei, Andrew Garfield, and Tobey Maguire. In the film, Parker asks Dr. Stephen Strange (Cumberbatch) to use magic to make his identity as Spider-Man a secret again following its public revelation at the end of *Far From Home*. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Tom Holland as Peter Parker / Spider-Man:  \nA teenager and Avenger who received spider-like abilities after being bitten by a radioactive spider.[5] The film explores the fallout of *Spider-Man: Far From Home*'s (2019) mid-credits scene, in which Parker's identity as Spider-Man is exposed,[6] and Parker is more pessimistic in contrast to previous Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) films. Holland said Parker feels defeated and insecure and was excited to explore the darker side of the character.[7] The adjustment back to portraying Parker, including raising his voice pitch and returning to the mindset of a \"na\u00efve, charming teenager\", was strange for Holland after taking on more mature roles such as in *Cherry* (2021).[8]\n* Zendaya as Michelle \"MJ\" Jones-Watson:  \nParker's classmate and girlfriend.[9][10][11] The character's full name is revealed in the film, having previously just been known as Michelle Jones, bringing her closer to the comics counterpart Mary Jane Watson.[10]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRhys Ifans reprises his role as Dr. Curt Connors / Lizard, an Oscorp scientist from Webb's *The Amazing Spider-Man* (2012) who transformed into a large reptilian monster while trying to regrow his missing arm. Thomas Haden Church reprises his role as Flint Marko / Sandman, a small-time thief from Raimi's *Spider-Man 3* who received an ability to transform into sand.[22] Both Ifans and Church returned to voice the characters, though footage at the end of the film when they revert to their human forms was archival footage from *The Amazing Spider-Man* and *Spider-Man 3*, respectively.[39] Watts served as a stand-in for Church on-set by providing motion-capture reference to the uncredited body double who physically replaced Church in the role.[40] Charlie Cox reprises his role as Matt Murdock from Marvel Television's Netflix series,[41] and Tom Hardy reprises his roles as Eddie Brock / Venom from Sony's Spider-Man Universe (SSU) in an uncredited cameo appearance in the mid-credits scene.[42]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nJonah Jameson from *Far From Home* (Simmons previously played a different version of the character in the Raimi trilogy as well).[47] It was also confirmed that the characters Electro and Green Goblin would appear in the film,[19][20][120] with the implication that this incarnation of Green Goblin would be Willem Dafoe's version from the Raimi films.[120] In September 2021, Garfield again denied he was in the film, saying, \"No matter what I say... it's either going to be really disappointing for people or it's going to be really exciting\".[121] Garfield later described his denials as \"rather stressful but also weirdly enjoyable\".[122]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n40. **^** Jirak, Jamie (February 23, 2022). \"Spider-Man: No Way Home's Jon Watts Performed Motion Reference Clips for Sandman\". *ComicBook.com*.

They had not been able to focus on those scenes earlier because they were busy during filming of much of the first and second acts in the previous months.[16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Lead actor Tom Holland and director Jon Watts in 2016\nDuring production on *Spider-Man: Homecoming* (2017), two sequels were being planned by Marvel Studios and Sony Pictures.[53] In June 2017, star Tom Holland explained that each film would take place during a different year of high school for Peter Parker / Spider-Man, with the third being set during the character's senior year.[54] Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige noted in July 2019 that the third film would feature \"a Peter Parker story that has never been done before on film\" due to the ending of the second film, *Spider-Man: Far From Home* (2019), which publicly reveals that Parker is Spider-Man.[55]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBy December 2020, Alfred Molina was set to reprise his role as Otto Octavius / Doctor Octopus from Sam Raimi's *Spider-Man 2* (2004),[25] with Tobey Maguire reprising his role as Peter Parker / Spider-Man from Raimi's *Spider-Man* film trilogy and Andrew Garfield returning as Peter Parker / Spider-Man from Webb's *The Amazing Spider-Man* films.[31] A cameo appearance of Maguire and Garfield alongside Holland as their respective Spider-Men had previously been considered for the Sony Pictures Animation film *Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse* (2018), but was cut then because Sony felt at that moment that it would be too risky and confusing.[99] At that time, *Collider* reported that Maguire and Garfield would appear in the film alongside Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson from Raimi's *Spider-Man* film trilogy and Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy from the *Amazing Spider-Man* films.[100] The first draft of the script included other characters from the *Spider-Man* and *Amazing Spider-Man* films, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n85. **^** Labonte, Rachel (October 22, 2020). \"Tom Holland Wraps Filming On Uncharted Movie Tomorrow\". *Screen Rant*.

Negotiations between Sony and Marvel Studios to alter their deal\u2014in which they produce the Spider-Man films together\u2014ended with Marvel Studios leaving the project in August 2019, but a negative fan reaction led to a new deal between the companies a month later. Watts, McKenna, Sommers, and Holland were set to return, and filming took place from October 2020 to March 2021 in New York City and Atlanta. *No Way Home* serves as a crossover between the MCU and the *Spider-Man* films directed by Sam Raimi and Marc Webb, featuring several actors reprising their roles from those films, including previous Spider-Man actors Maguire and Garfield. The involvement of both actors was the subject of wide speculation and numerous leaks despite the efforts of Sony, Marvel, and the cast to conceal their involvement.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBy August 2019, a fourth film in the franchise was in development alongside *No Way Home*.[56] In February 2021, Holland said *No Way Home* was the final film under his contract but he hoped to continue playing Spider-Man in the future if asked.[260] That October, Holland said *No Way Home* was being treated as \"the end of a franchise\" that began with *Homecoming*, with any additional solo films featuring the MCU Spider-Man characters to be different from the first trilogy of films and feature a tonal change.[27] A month later, Holland said he was unsure if he should continue making Spider-Man films and felt he would have \"done something wrong\" if he was still portraying the character in his thirties. He expressed interest in a film focusing on the Miles Morales version of Spider-Man instead. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nJeffrey Ford and Leigh Folsom Boyd served as the film's editors.[137] The visual effects were provided by Cinesite, Clear Angle Studios, Crafty Apes, Digital Domain, Folks VFX, Framestore, Luma Pictures, Monsters Aliens Robots Zombies, Mr. X, Perception, Secret Lab, Sony Pictures Imageworks, and SSVFX.[138]\n\n\n\n## Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *Spider-Man: No Way Home* (soundtrack)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n76. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Moreau, Jordan (July 23, 2020). \"'Spider-Man: Far From Home' Sequel Delayed to December 2021\". *Variety*.
