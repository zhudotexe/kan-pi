In winter, temperatures tend to range between 12 and 22 °C (54 and 72 °F). The record high temperature was 37.8 °C (100.0 °F) on 17 October 2014[60] and the lowest −3.2 °C (26.2 °F) on 25 June 1918.[61][62] The Tropic of Capricorn, at about 23°27' S, passes through north of São Paulo and roughly marks the boundary between the tropical and temperate areas of South America. Because of its elevation, however, São Paulo experiences a more temperate climate.[63] The city experiences four seasons. The summer is warm and rainy. Autumn and spring are transitional seasons. Winter is the coldest season, with cloudiness around town and frequently polar air masses.

In the summer of 2014, São Paulo was affected by a heat wave that lasted for almost 4 weeks with highs above 30 °C (86 °F), peaking on 36 °C (97 °F). Secondary to deforestation, groundwater pollution, and climate change, São Paulo is increasingly susceptible to drought and water shortages.[66]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Climate data for São Paulo (Mirante de Santana, 1991–2020, extremes 1887–present)\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 37.0(98.6)\n | 35.9(96.6)\n | 34.3(93.7)\n | 33.4(92.1)\n | 31.7(89.1)\n | 28.8(83.8)\n | 30.2(86.4)\n | 33.0(91.4)\n | 35.7(96.3)\n | 35.9(96.6)\n | 35.3(95.5)\n | 35.6(96.1)\n | 37.0(98.6)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | 28.6(83.5)\n | 29.0(84.2)\n | 28.0(82.4)\n | 26.6(79.9)\n | 23.4(74.1)\n | 22.9(73.2)\n | 22.9(73.2)\n | 24.5(76.1)\n | 25.2(77.4)\n | 26.5(79.7)\n | 26.9(80.4)\n | 28.3(82.9)\n | 26.1(79.0)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | 23.1(73.6)\n | 23.5(74.3)\n | 22.5(72.5)\n | 21.2(70.2)\n | 18.4(65.1)\n | 17.5(63.5)\n | 17.2(63.0)\n | 18.1(64.6)\n | 19.1(66.4)\n | 20.5(68.9)\n | 21.2(70.2)\n | 22.6(72.7)\n | 20.4(68.7)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | 19.4(66.9)\n | 19.6(67.3)\n | 18.9(66.0)\n | 17.5(63.5)\n | 14.7(58.5)\n | 13.5(56.3)\n | 12.8(55.0)\n | 13.3(55.9)\n | 14.9(58.8)\n | 16.5(61.7)\n | 17.3(63.1)\n | 18.7(65.7)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Climate data for São Paulo (Horto Florestal, 1961–1990)\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 34.6(94.3)\n | 35.8(96.4)\n | 33.4(92.1)\n | 32.0(89.6)\n | 29.5(85.1)\n | 29.4(84.9)\n | 29.0(84.2)\n | 33.2(91.8)\n | 35.2(95.4)\n | 34.3(93.7)\n | 34.6(94.3)\n | 33.9(93.0)\n | 35.8(96.4)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | 27.0(80.6)\n | 27.8(82.0)\n | 27.3(81.1)\n | 24.9(76.8)\n | 23.0(73.4)\n | 22.0(71.6)\n | 22.0(71.6)\n | 23.7(74.7)\n | 24.5(76.1)\n | 24.7(76.5)\n | 25.7(78.3)\n | 26.3(79.3)\n | 24.9(76.8)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | 21.2(70.2)\n | 21.6(70.9)\n | 21.1(70.0)\n | 18.8(65.8)\n | 16.7(62.1)\n | 15.6(60.1)\n | 15.1(59.2)\n | 16.4(61.5)\n | 17.6(63.7)\n | 18.5(65.3)\n | 19.5(67.1)\n | 20.6(69.1)\n | 18.6(65.4)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | 16.6(61.9)\n | 16.9(62.4)\n | 16.3(61.3)\n | 14.1(57.4)\n | 11.7(53.1)\n | 10.5(50.9)\n | 9.7(49.5)\n | 10.9(51.6)\n | 12.4(54.3)\n | 13.7(56.7)\n | 14.6(58.3)\n | 16.0(60.8)\n | 13.6(56.5)\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | 10.3(50.5)\n | 11.1(52.0)\n | 9.6(49.3)\n | 3.5(38.3)\n | 0.2(32.4)\n | −1.8(28.8)\n | 0.2(32.4)\n | 0.4(32.7)\n | 3.0(37.4)\n | 5.7(42.3)\n | 7.0(44.6)\n | 9.2(48.6)\n | −1.8(28.8)\n |\n| Average rainfall mm (inches)\n | 245.6(9.67)\n | 243.8(9.60)\n | 159.2(6.27)\n | 76.0(2.99)\n | 59.7(2.35)\n | 58.7(2.31)\n | 53.1(2.09)\n | 39.9(1.57)\n | 76.2(3.00)\n | 162.7(6.41)\n | 195.7(7.70)\n | 220.6(8.69)\n | 1,591.3(62.65)\n |\n| Average rainy days (≥ 1 mm) | 16\n | 14\n | 11\n | 7\n | 6\n | 5\n | 5\n | 4\n | 7\n | 11\n | 12\n | 15\n | 113\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 81.0\n | 80.4\n | 80.3\n | 81.2\n | 80.5\n | 79.2\n | 77.4\n | 74.6\n | 76.2\n | 79.3\n | 79.4\n | 80.4\n | 79.2\n |\n| Source: Brazilian National Institute of Meteorology (INMET).[75][76][77][78][79][80][81][82][83] |\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Brazilians, Demographics of São Paulo, and Demographics of Brazil\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n56. **^** \"Carros de R$ 6 mil antecipariam apagão no trânsito\".

Neither São Paulo nor the nearby coast has ever been hit by a tropical cyclone and tornadic activity is uncommon. During late winter, especially August, the city experiences the phenomenon known as *\"veranico\"* or *\"verãozinho\"* (\"little summer\"), which consists of hot and dry weather, sometimes reaching temperatures well above 28 °C (82 °F). On the other hand, relatively cool days during summer are fairly common when persistent winds blow from the ocean. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n61. **^** \"Revista Galileu – Quando a neve chega ao Brasil\". *revistagalileu.globo.com*.

Amounts range from about six hours per day on the Inland Sea coast and sheltered parts of the Pacific Coast and Kantō Plain to four hours per day on the Sea of Japan coast of Hokkaidō. In December there is a very pronounced sunshine gradient between the Sea of Japan and the Pacific coasts, as the former side can receive less than 30 hours and the Pacific side as much as 180 hours. In summer, however, sunshine hours are lowest on exposed parts of the Pacific coast where fogs from the Oyashio current create persistent cloud cover similar to that found on the Kuril Islands and Sakhalin.\n\n\n\n## Extreme temperature records[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| August | 41.0 | 105.8 | Ekawaski, Kochi | 12 August 2013 | −4.3 | 24.3 | Mount Fuji | 25 August 1972\n |\n| September | 40.4 | 104.7 | Sanjō, Niigata | 3 September 2020 | −10.8 | 12.6 | Mount Fuji | 23 September 1976\n |\n| October | 35.1 | 95.2 | Itoigawa, Niigata | 9 October 2013 | −19.5 | −3.2 | Mount Fuji | 30 October 1984\n |\n| November | 34.2 | 94.4 | Minami-Tori-shima | 4 November 1953 | −28.1 | −18.6 | Mount Fuji | 30 November 1970\n |\n| December | 31.6 | 88.9 | Minami-Tori-shima | 5 December 1952 | −34.2 | −29.6 | Obihiro, Hokkaido | 30 December 1907\n |\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_qpVNRk7k3Y7WxiXkfFZLoVOu","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

In winter, cold northerly winds from Siberia can cause nighttime temperatures to drop below freezing, and although not usually associated with snow, the city can receive one or two days of snowfall per year. In contrast, and in spite of being the peak tourist season, summer in Shanghai is very warm and humid, with occasional downpours or freak thunderstorms. The city is also susceptible to typhoons, none of which in recent years has caused considerable damage.[12] The most pleasant seasons are Spring, although changeable, and Autumn, which is generally sunny and dry.\n\n\n**Climate statistics of 2013:**[13]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nShanghai is located in the middle of China's east coast, near the mouth of the Yangtze River, being one of the core cities in the Yangtze River Delta region and one of the coastal cities in China. It is bordered by the Yangtze River to the north, the East China Sea to the east, Hangzhou Bay to the south, and Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces to the west. The city is roughly equidistant to Beijing and Hong Kong, and is located at 31°12′N 121°30′E﻿ / ﻿31.200°N 121.500°E﻿ / 31.200; 121.500, roughly the same latitude as San Diego, New Orleans, Bermuda, Marrakech, Cairo, Jerusalem, and Lahore. Cities within mainland China that lie on approximately the same longitude include Fuxin, Jinzhou, Dalian, Yantai, Ningbo, and Taizhou (Zhejiang). The municipality lies about due north of Taipei and Manila.\n\n\n\n* Latitude: 30° 42' to 31° 52' N\n* Longitude: 120° 52' to 121° 58' E\n\n\n### Area[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe vast majority of Shanghai's land area is flat, apart from a few hills in the southwest corner, due to its location on the alluvial plain of the Yangtze's river delta. The city has many rivers and lakes and is known for its rich water resources, and thanks to its coastal, riverside location and warm climate ensuring ice-free waters, provides easy access to China's interior, resulting in Shanghai being the world's largest port.[1]\n\n\n\n\n## Statistics[edit]\n\n\n### Location[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | 49\n | 50\n | 45\n | 46\n | 42\n | 41\n | 42\n |\n| Source: China Meteorological Administration[14][15] |\n\n## Cityscape[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The 16 districts and 1 county that make up the Municipality of Shanghai\nPuxi:\n\nYangpu\n\nHongkou\n\nZhabei\n\nPutuo\n\nChangning\n\nXuhui\n\nJing'an\n\nHuangpu\n\nChongming\n\nBaoshan\n\nJiading\n\nPudong\n\nQingpu\n\nMinhang\n\nSongjiang\n\nFengxian\n\nJinshan\n\nShanghai city proper is bisected by the Huangpu River: Puxi, on the west side, is the historic center of the city, and includes the districts of Yangpu, Hongkou, Putuo, Changning, Xuhui, Jing'an, and Huangpu.

A 10-year, US$1 billion cleanup of Suzhou Creek, which runs through the city center, is expected to be finished in 2008,[16] and the government also provides incentives for transportation companies to invest in LPG buses and taxis. Air pollution in Shanghai is low compared to other Chinese cities such as Beijing, but the rapid development over the past decades means it is still high on worldwide standards, comparable to Los Angeles.[17]\n\n\n\n\n## Maps and satellite images[edit]\n\n\n* ![German map of Shanghai in 1888](image)\n\nGerman map of Shanghai in 1888\n* ![US Army 1933 map](image)\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_au313BUQ8BlPtu0LBMqOMbf7","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

Land that is north of the twenty-fourth parallel experiences lower temperatures during the winter months. South of the twenty-fourth parallel, temperatures are fairly consistent all year round and vary solely as a function of elevation. The north of the country usually receives less precipitation than the south.\n\n\n\n\n## By region[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n8. **^** Wirtz, Nic (2017-10-16). \"Climate change and migration in Mexico: Fifth in our series\". *Global Americans*.

Temperatures here remain high throughout the year, with only a 5 °C (9 °F) difference between winter and summer median temperatures. Although low-lying areas north of the twenty-fourth parallel are hot and humid during the summer, they generally have lower yearly temperature averages (from 20 to 24 °C or 68.0 to 75.2 °F) because of more moderate conditions during the winter.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMexico has pronounced wet and dry seasons. Most of the country experiences a rainy season from June to mid-October and significantly less rain during the remainder of the year. February and July generally are the driest and wettest months, respectively. Mexico City, for example, receives an average of only 5 millimeters (0.2 in) of rain during February but more than 160 millimeters (6.3 in) in July. Coastal areas, especially those along the Gulf of Mexico, experience the largest amounts of rain in September. Tabasco typically records more than 300 millimeters (11.8 in) of rain during that month. A portion of northwestern Baja California has a Mediterranean climate influenced by the California Current, with a rainy season that occurs in winter and coastal regions receiving considerable fog. Another area of the Mediterranean climate as a result of elevation occurs in the interior of Sonora.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n*San Pedro Mártir National Park*  \n **Warm-summer mediterranean climate (Csb)**\n* ![Real de Catorce Cold arid climate (BWk)](image)\n\n*Real de Catorce*  \n**Cold arid climate (BWk)**\n* ![Cobá Tropical savanna climate (Aw)](image)\n\n*Cobá*  \n **Tropical savanna climate (Aw)**\n* ![Pico de Orizaba Ice Cap climate (EF)](image)\n\n*Pico de Orizaba*  \n**Ice Cap climate (EF)**\n\n## Weather records[edit]\n\n\nTemperature\n* **Heat**: 52.5 °C (126.5 °F) in San Luis Río Colorado, Sonora on 15 June 1966[2]\n* **Cold**: −29 °C (−20.2 °F) in Los Lamentos, Chihuahua on 11 January 1962[3]\n\n\nPrecipitation\n* Western Hemisphere record for **24-hour rainfall**: 1633.98 mm (64.33 inches) over the time period of 12:30 UTC on 21 October 2005 to 12:30 UTC 22 October 2005 on Isla Mujeres, Quintana Roo during the passage of Hurricane Wilma.[4] Also the record for the Northern Hemisphere.[5]\n\n\n## Climate change[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Large cloud over Mexican landscape.\nThis section is an excerpt from Climate change in Mexico.[edit]\nClimate change in Mexico is expected to have widespread impacts: with significant decreases in precipitation and increases in temperatures. This will put pressure on the economy, people and the biodiversity of many parts of the country, which have largely arid or hot climates. Already climate change has impacted agriculture,[6] biodiversity, farmer livelihoods, and migration,[7][8] as well as water, health, air pollution, traffic disruption from floods, and housing vulnerability to landslides.[9][10]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAltered precipitation patterns and warming temperatures have led to economic insecurity in Mexico, particularly for smallholder farmers who grow Mexico's economically and culturally important crops: maize and coffee. Climate change impacts are especially severe in Mexico City, due to increases in air pollution.[11][*clarification needed*] Ecological impacts of climate change within Mexico include reductions in landscape connectivity and shifting migratory patterns of animals. Furthermore, climate change in Mexico is tied to worldwide trade and economic processes which relate directly to global food security.[*clarification needed*]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Climate change in Mexico\n* Geography of Mexico\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nRainfall varies widely both by location and season. Arid or semiarid conditions are encountered in the Baja California Peninsula, the northwestern state of Sonora, the northern altiplano, and also significant portions of the southern altiplano. Rainfall in these regions averages between 300 and 600 millimeters (11.8 and 23.6 in) per year, although even less in some areas, particularly in the state of Baja California. Average rainfall totals are between 600 and 1,000 millimeters (23.6 and 39.4 in) in most of the major populated areas of the southern altiplano, including Mexico City and Guadalajara. Low-lying areas along the Gulf of Mexico receive in excess of 1,000 millimeters (39.4 in) of rainfall in an average year, with the wettest region being the southeastern state of Tabasco, which typically receives approximately 2,000 millimeters (78.7 in) of rainfall on an annual basis. Parts of the northern altiplano, highlands and high peaks in the Sierra Madres receive yearly snowfall. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMexico lies squarely within the hurricane belt, and all regions of both coasts are susceptible to these storms from June through November. Hurricanes on the Pacific coast are often less violent than those affecting Mexico's eastern coastline. Several hurricanes per year strike the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico coastline, however, and these storms bring high winds, heavy rain, extensive damage, and occasional loss of life. Hurricane Gilbert passed directly over Cancún in September 1988, with winds in excess of 200 kilometers per hour (124 mph), producing major damage to hotels in the resort area.

The lower region of the valley receives less rainfall than the upper regions of the south; the lower boroughs of Iztapalapa, Iztacalco, Venustiano Carranza and the east portion of Gustavo A. Madero are usually drier and warmer than the upper southern boroughs of Tlalpan and Milpa Alta, a mountainous region of pine and oak trees known as the range of Ajusco. The average annual temperature varies from 12 to 16 °C (54 to 61 °F), depending on the altitude of the borough. The temperature is rarely below 3 °C (37 °F) or above 30 °C (86 °F).[97] At the Tacubaya observatory, the lowest temperature ever registered was −4.4 °C (24 °F) on 13 February 1960, and the highest temperature on record was 33.9 °C (93 °F) on 9 May 1998.[98] Overall precipitation is heavily concentrated in the summer months, and includes dense hail.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n106. **^** Lafregua, J; Gutierrez, A; Aguilar E; Aparicio J; Mejia R; Santillan O; Suarez MA; Preciado M (2003). \"Balance hídrico del Valle de Mexico\" (PDF).

The city has 16 boroughs or *demarcaciones territoriales*, which are in turn divided into neighborhoods or *colonias*.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn contrast, the boroughs of Xochimilco (172nd), Tláhuac (177th), and Iztapalapa (183rd) presented the lowest HDI values of Mexico City, with values of 0.8481, 0.8473, and 0.8464, respectively, which are still in the global high-HDI range. The only borough that did not have a high HDI was that of rural Milpa Alta, which had a \"medium\" HDI of 0.7984, far below those of all the other boroughs (627th nationally, the rest being in the top 200). Mexico City's HDI for the 2005 report was 0.9012 (very high), and its 2010 value of 0.9225 (very high), or (by newer methodology) 0.8307, was Mexico's highest.[150]\n\n\n\n### Law enforcement[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Law enforcement in Mexico City\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Air pollution over Mexico City. Air quality is poorest during the winter.\nBy the 1990s Mexico City had become infamous as one of the world's most polluted cities; however, the city has since become a model for drastically lowering pollution levels. By 2014 carbon monoxide pollution had dropped drastically, while sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide were at levels about a third of those in 1992. The levels of signature pollutants in Mexico City are similar to those of Los Angeles.[83] Despite the cleanup, the metropolitan area is still the most ozone-polluted part of the country, with ozone levels 2.5 times beyond WHO-defined safe limits.[84]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n12. **^** Agren, David (29 January 2016). \"Mexico City officially changes its name to – Mexico City\". *The Guardian*.
