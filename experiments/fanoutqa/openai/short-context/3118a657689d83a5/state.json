The most recent to join the list were Leicester City (2015\u201316 champions) and before that, Nottingham Forest (1977\u201378) and Derby County (1971\u201372).\n\n\nFive teams have won the league title three seasons in a row: Huddersfield Town (1924\u20131926), Arsenal (1933\u20131935), Liverpool (1982\u20131984), Manchester United twice (1999\u20132001 & 2007\u20132009) and Manchester City (2021\u20132023).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThis article is about men's English football league champions.

Of these, Cardiff City came closest to winning the league, matching champions Huddersfield Town in points but losing out on goal average (goals scored divided by goals conceded), the precursor to goal difference.\n\n\nTeams in **bold** compete in the Premier League as of the 2023\u201324 season.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* List of football clubs in England by competitive honours won\n* English football clubs in international competitions\n* List of English football first tier top scorers\n* List of First Division and Premier League winning managers\n* List of Premier League winning players\n* List of FA Cup finals\n* List of EFL Cup finals\n* List of FA Community Shield matches\n* List of English women's football champions\n* List of association football competitions\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRules stipulating a maximum wage for players were abolished in 1961. This resulted in a shift of power towards bigger clubs.[7] Financial considerations became an even bigger influence from 1992, when the teams then in the First Division defected to form the FA Premier League. This supplanted the Football League First Division as the highest level of football in England,[8] and due to a series of progressively larger television contracts, put unprecedented wealth into the hands of top flight clubs.[9] The first five champions in the Premier League era \u2013 Arsenal, Blackburn Rovers, Chelsea, Manchester City and Manchester United \u2013 had all won the title at least once prior to 1992. Leicester City were champions for the first time in 2016, becoming the first team to win the Premier League without having previously won the First Division. Other than inaugural league champions Preston North End, Ipswich Town remain the only club to win the top flight division at their first ever attempt.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nManchester United have won twenty titles,[11] the most of any club.[12] United's rivals Liverpool are second with nineteen. Liverpool dominated during the 1970s and 1980s (winning eleven league titles between 1973 and 1990), while Manchester United dominated in the 1990s and 2000s under manager Sir Alex Ferguson (eleven league titles between 1993\nand 2009). Arsenal are third with thirteen titles, having dominated during the 1930s (five league titles between 1931 and 1938). Everton and Manchester City are joint-fourth with nine titles, of which seven of City's have been won in the 2010s and 2020s. Aston Villa (seven) and Sunderland (six) secured the majority of their titles before the 1920s.

The club was founded as Newton Heath LYR F.C. in 1878 and turned professional in 1885, before joining the Football League in 1892. After a brush with bankruptcy in 1901, the club reformed as Manchester United in 1902. Manchester United currently play in the Premier League, the top tier of English football. They have not been out of the top tier since 1975, and they have never been lower than the second tier.[1] They have also been involved in European football ever since they became the first English club to enter the European Cup in 1956.[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n19. **^** \"History of the Premier League\". *Premier League*.

On 17 October 2005, Henry became the club's top goalscorer of all time;[39] two goals against Sparta Prague in the Champions League meant he broke Ian Wright's record of 185 goals.[40] On 1 February 2006, he scored a goal against West Ham United, bringing his league goal tally up to 151, breaking Arsenal legend Cliff Bastin's league goals record.[41] Henry scored his 100th league goal at Highbury, a feat unparalleled in the history of the club, and a unique achievement in the Premier League.[42] On the final day of the Premier League season, Henry scored a hat-trick against Wigan Athletic in the last match played at Highbury. He completed the season as the league's top goalscorer,[2] was voted the FWA Footballer of the Year for the third time in his career, and was selected in the FIFA World XI.[16][43]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* UEFA Ultimate Team of the Year (published 2015)[241]\n* UEFA Euro All-time XI (published 2016)[242]\n* Ballon d'Or Dream Team (Bronze): 2020[243]\n* Premier League Hall of Fame: 2021[244]\n\n\n**Orders**\n\n\n\n* Knight of the Legion of Honour: 1998[245]\n\n\n## Records[edit]\n\n\n*As of October 2022*\n### Arsenal[edit]\n\n\n* All-time top scorer: 228 goals[246]\n* Most league goals: 175 goals[246]\n* Most European goals: 42[246]\n* Most Champions League goals: 35[246]\n* Most Premier League goals in a season: 30 (2003\u201304) (shared with Robin van Persie)[246]\n* Most Premier League hat-tricks: 8[247]\n* Most European appearances: 86[248]\n* Most Champions League appearances: 78[248]\n* Most Arsenal Player of the Season Awards: 4[237]\n\n\n### Continental[edit]\n\n\n* Most European Golden Shoe wins while playing in England: 2 (2003\u201304 & 2004\u201305)[249]\n* One of four players to win back-to-back European Golden Shoes (shared with Ally McCoist, Lionel Messi & Cristiano Ronaldo)[250]\n\n\n### England[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Henry in a Premier League game against Charlton Athletic at Highbury in March 2006\nEntering the 2003\u201304 season, Arsenal were determined to reclaim the Premier League crown. Henry was again instrumental in Arsenal's exceptionally successful campaign; together with the likes of Dennis Bergkamp, Patrick Vieira, Freddie Ljungberg and Robert Pires, Henry ensured that the Gunners became the first team in more than a century to go through the entire domestic league season unbeaten, claiming the league title in the process.[35] Apart from being named for the second year running as the PFA Players' Player of the Year and FWA Footballer of the Year,[30][31] Henry emerged once again as the runner-up for 2004 FIFA World Player of the Year award.[23] With 39 goals scored in all competitions, the Frenchman led the league in goals scored and won the European Golden Boot.[2][36] However, as was the case in 2002, Henry was unable to lead the national side to honours during UEFA Euro 2004.[12]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n253. **^** Victor Kalumba (3 May 2017). \"European Golden Boot Winners list \u2013 Past all time Winners 1968\u20132018\".

Despite recording fewer goals and assists than his first season, Henry's second season with Arsenal proved to be a breakthrough, as he became the club's top goalscorer. His goal tally included a spectacular strike against Manchester United where he flicked the ball up (with his back turned to goal), before he swivelled and volleyed in from 20 yards out.[25] The strike also featured a memorable goal celebration where he recreated the Budweiser \"Whassup?\" advertisement.[26] Armed with one of the league's best attacks, Arsenal finished runner-up to perennial rivals Manchester United in the Premier League. The team also reached the final of the FA Cup, losing 2\u20131 to Liverpool. Henry remained frustrated, however, by the fact that he had yet to help the club win honours, and frequently expressed his desire to establish Arsenal as a powerhouse.[12]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSuccess finally arrived during the 2001\u201302 season. Arsenal finished seven points above Liverpool to win the Premier League title, and defeated Chelsea 2\u20130 in the FA Cup Final.[12] Henry became the league's top goalscorer and netted 32 goals in all competitions as he led Arsenal to a double and his first silverware with the club.[2][27] There was much expectation that Henry would replicate his club form for France during the 2002 FIFA World Cup, but the defending champions suffered a shock exit at the group stage.[12]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n259. **^** \"Premier League Golden Boots Through the Years\". *The Gane Hunter*.
