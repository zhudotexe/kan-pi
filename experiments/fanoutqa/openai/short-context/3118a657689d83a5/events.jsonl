Of these, Cardiff City came closest to winning the league, matching champions Huddersfield Town in points but losing out on goal average (goals scored divided by goals conceded), the precursor to goal difference.\n\n\nTeams in **bold** compete in the Premier League as of the 2023–24 season.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* List of football clubs in England by competitive honours won\n* English football clubs in international competitions\n* List of English football first tier top scorers\n* List of First Division and Premier League winning managers\n* List of Premier League winning players\n* List of FA Cup finals\n* List of EFL Cup finals\n* List of FA Community Shield matches\n* List of English women's football champions\n* List of association football competitions\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRules stipulating a maximum wage for players were abolished in 1961. This resulted in a shift of power towards bigger clubs.[7] Financial considerations became an even bigger influence from 1992, when the teams then in the First Division defected to form the FA Premier League. This supplanted the Football League First Division as the highest level of football in England,[8] and due to a series of progressively larger television contracts, put unprecedented wealth into the hands of top flight clubs.[9] The first five champions in the Premier League era – Arsenal, Blackburn Rovers, Chelsea, Manchester City and Manchester United – had all won the title at least once prior to 1992. Leicester City were champions for the first time in 2016, becoming the first team to win the Premier League without having previously won the First Division. Other than inaugural league champions Preston North End, Ipswich Town remain the only club to win the top flight division at their first ever attempt.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nManchester United have won twenty titles,[11] the most of any club.[12] United's rivals Liverpool are second with nineteen. Liverpool dominated during the 1970s and 1980s (winning eleven league titles between 1973 and 1990), while Manchester United dominated in the 1990s and 2000s under manager Sir Alex Ferguson (eleven league titles between 1993\nand 2009). Arsenal are third with thirteen titles, having dominated during the 1930s (five league titles between 1931 and 1938). Everton and Manchester City are joint-fourth with nine titles, of which seven of City's have been won in the 2010s and 2020s. Aston Villa (seven) and Sunderland (six) secured the majority of their titles before the 1920s. Chelsea (six) won the majority of their titles in the 21st century (between 2005 and 2017).\n\n\nHuddersfield Town, Arsenal, Liverpool, Manchester United and Manchester City are the only sides to have won the league title in three consecutive seasons; no team has been crowned champion four seasons in a row.[13]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![List of English football champions is located in England](image)![Blackburn Rovers](image)\nBlackburn Rovers\n![Burnley](image)\nBurnley\n![Derby County](image)\nDerby County\n![Huddersfield Town](image)\nHuddersfield Town\n![Ipswich Town](image)\nIpswich Town\n![Leeds United](image)\nLeeds United\n![Leicester City](image)\nLeicester City\n![Newcastle United](image)\nNewcastle United\n![Nottingham Forest](image)\nNottingham Forest\n![Portsmouth](image)\nPortsmouth\n![Preston North End](image)\nPreston North End\n![Sheffield United](image)\nSheffield United\n![Sheffield Wednesday](image)\nSheffield Wednesday\n![Sunderland](image)\nSunderland\n![London (3)](image)\n*London (3)*\n![Manchester (2)](image)\n*Manchester (2)*\n![West Midlands (3)](image)\n*West Midlands (3)*\n![Liverpool (2)](image)\n*Liverpool (2)*\nclass=notpageimage|\nLocation of English football champions\n | ![List of English football champions is located in Greater Manchester](image)![Manchester City](image)\nManchester City\n![Manchester United](image)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Rank\n | Club\n | Winners\n | Runners-up | Winning seasons\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | **Manchester United** | 20\n | 17\n | 1907–08, 1910–11, 1951–52, 1955–56, 1956–57, 1964–65, 1966–67, 1992–93, 1993–94, 1995–96, 1996–97, 1998–99, 1999–2000, 2000–01, 2002–03, 2006–07, 2007–08, 2008–09, 2010–11, 2012–13 |\n| 2\n | **Liverpool** | 19\n | 15\n | 1900–01, 1905–06, 1921–22, 1922–23, 1946–47, 1963–64, 1965–66, 1972–73, 1975–76, 1976–77, 1978–79, 1979–80, 1981–82, 1982–83, 1983–84, 1985–86, 1987–88, 1989–90, 2019–20 |\n| 3\n | **Arsenal** | 13\n | 10\n | 1930–31, 1932–33, 1933–34, 1934–35, 1937–38, 1947–48, 1952–53, 1970–71, 1988–89, 1990–91, 1997–98, 2001–02, 2003–04 |\n| 4\n | **Everton** | 9\n | 7\n | 1890–91, 1914–15, 1927–28, 1931–32, 1938–39, 1962–63, 1969–70, 1984–85, 1986–87 |\n| **Manchester City** | 6\n | 1936–37, 1967–68, 2011–12, 2013–14, 2017–18, 2018–19, 2020–21, 2021–22, 2022–23 |\n| 5\n | **Aston Villa** | 7\n | 10\n | 1893–94, 1895–96, 1896–97, 1898–99, 1899–1900, 1909–10, 1980–81 |\n| 6\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nManchester United\nclass=notpageimage|\nGreater Manchester\n![List of English football champions is located in Merseyside](image)![Everton](image)\nEverton\n![Liverpool](image)\nLiverpool\nclass=notpageimage|\nLiverpool\n![List of English football champions is located in West Midlands county](image)![Aston Villa](image)\nAston Villa\n![West Bromwich Albion](image)\nWest Bromwich Albion\n![Wolverhampton Wanderers](image)\nWolverhampton Wanderers\nclass=notpageimage|\nWest Midlands\n\n![List of English football champions is located in Greater London](image)![Arsenal](image)\nArsenal\n![Chelsea](image)\nChelsea\n![Tottenham Hotspur](image)\nTottenham Hotspur\nclass=notpageimage|\nGreater London\n |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n## List of champions[edit]\n\n\n### Football League (1888–1892)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Season | Champions (number of titles) | Runners-up | Third place | Winning manager\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1888–89 | Preston North End[a][b] (1)\n | Aston Villa (1)\n | Wolverhampton Wanderers (1)\n | ![England](image) William Sudell (secretary manager) |\n| 1889–90 | Preston North End (2)\n | Everton (1)\n | Blackburn Rovers (1)\n | ![England](image) William Sudell (secretary manager) |\n| 1890–91 | Everton (1)\n | Preston North End (1)\n | Notts County (1)\n | ![England](image) Dick Molyneux (secretary manager) |\n| 1891–92 | Sunderland (1)\n | Preston North End (2)\n | Bolton Wanderers (1)\n | ![England](image) Tom Watson |\n\n\n### Football League First Division (1892–1992)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAll the clubs which have ever been champions are still in existence today and all take part in the top four tiers of the English football league system.

Despite recording fewer goals and assists than his first season, Henry's second season with Arsenal proved to be a breakthrough, as he became the club's top goalscorer. His goal tally included a spectacular strike against Manchester United where he flicked the ball up (with his back turned to goal), before he swivelled and volleyed in from 20 yards out.[25] The strike also featured a memorable goal celebration where he recreated the Budweiser \"Whassup?\" advertisement.[26] Armed with one of the league's best attacks, Arsenal finished runner-up to perennial rivals Manchester United in the Premier League. The team also reached the final of the FA Cup, losing 2–1 to Liverpool. Henry remained frustrated, however, by the fact that he had yet to help the club win honours, and frequently expressed his desire to establish Arsenal as a powerhouse.[12]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSuccess finally arrived during the 2001–02 season. Arsenal finished seven points above Liverpool to win the Premier League title, and defeated Chelsea 2–0 in the FA Cup Final.[12] Henry became the league's top goalscorer and netted 32 goals in all competitions as he led Arsenal to a double and his first silverware with the club.[2][27] There was much expectation that Henry would replicate his club form for France during the 2002 FIFA World Cup, but the defending champions suffered a shock exit at the group stage.[12]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n259. **^** \"Premier League Golden Boots Through the Years\". *The Gane Hunter*.
