The following is a list of the ten largest institutions of higher education by Fall 2020 enrollment, meaning it is the number of unique individuals who were enrolled in at least one class on the 21st day of the Fall 2020 semester. Whether a system of individual campuses is counted as one or multiple institutions depends on how that institution is accredited and chartered. All data can be verified on the IPEDS system website.[1]\n\n\n\n### 2020[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| U.S. Department of Education Fall 2020 Enrollment[2] |\n| --- |\n| **Rank** | **Classification** | **Location** | **Enrollment** |\n| 1 | Western Governors University | Private | Online | 147,866\n |\n| 2 | Southern New Hampshire University | Private, Non-profit | New Hampshire | 134,345\n |\n| 3 | Grand Canyon University | Private, For-profit | Arizona | 103,427\n |\n| 4 | Liberty University | Private | Virginia | 93,349\n |\n| 5 | The Pennsylvania State University | Public | Pennsylvania | 89,816\n |\n| 6 | University of Phoenix-Arizona | Private, For-profit | Arizona | 89,763\n |\n| 7 | Arizona State University Campus Immersion | Public research university | Arizona | 74,795\n |\n| 8 | Dallas College | TBC | Texas | 74,781\n |\n| 9 | University of Central Florida | Public | Florida | 71,881\n |\n| 10 | Texas A & M University-College Station | Public | Texas | 70,418\n |\n\n\n### 2013[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| U.S. Department of Education Fall 2013 Enrollment[3] |\n| --- |\n| **Rank** | **College** | **Classification** | **Location** | **Enrollment** |\n| 1 | State University of New York System | Public | New York | 606,232\n |\n| 2 | California State University | Public | California | 477,466[4] |\n| 3 | University of Phoenix | Private, For-profit | Arizona | 442,033\n |\n| 4 | University of California | Public | California | 226,449[5] |\n| 5 | University of North Carolina System | Public\n | North Carolina | 222,322\n |\n| 6 | Ivy Tech Community College | Public | Indiana | 175,313\n |\n| 7 | Ashford University | Private, For-profit | Iowa | 169,843\n |\n| 8 | American Public University System | Private, For-profit | West Virginia | 110,644\n |\n| 9 | Liberty University | Private | Virginia | 110,000\n |\n| 10 | Miami Dade College | Public | Florida | 100,855\n |\n| 11 | Lone Star College System | Public | Texas | 98,313\n |\n| 12 | The Pennsylvania State University | Public | Pennsylvania | 94,441\n |\n| 13 | Houston Community College System | Public | Texas | 93,625\n |\n| 14 | Arizona State University | Public | Arizona | 81,789\n |\n| 15 | Kaplan University | Private, For-profit | Iowa | 77,566\n |\n| 16 | Northern Virginia Community College | Public | Virginia | 76,552\n |\n| 17 | Walden University | Private, For-profit | Minnesota | 75,895\n |\n| 18 | Tarrant County College District | Public | Texas | 75,547\n |\n| 19 | Wake Technical Community College | Public | North Carolina | 74,000[6] |\n| 20 | Grand Canyon University | Private[Note 1] | Arizona | 71,712\n |\n| 21 | Austin Community College District | Public | Texas | 70,452\n |\n| 22 | University of Central Florida | Public | Florida | 69,086\n |\n| 23 | Ohio State University | Public | Ohio | 64,930\n |\n| 24 | University of Maryland | Public | Maryland | 64,737\n |\n| 25 | University of Minnesota | Public | Minnesota | 63,929\n |\n| 26 | Broward College | Public | Florida | 62,796\n |\n| 27 | Florida International University | Public | Florida | 60,592\n |\n| 28 | Valencia College | Public | Florida | 60,469\n |\n| 29 | University of Florida | Public | Florida | 56,683\n |\n| 30 | East Los Angeles College | Public | California | 56,395\n |\n| 31 | College of Southern Nevada | Public | Nevada | 56,364\n |\n| 32 | Rio Salado College | Public | Arizona | 56,031\n |\n| 33 | Capella University | Private, For-profit | Minnesota | 56,009\n |\n| 34 | Portland Community College | Public | Oregon | 55,558\n |\n\n\n1. **^** As of July 1, 2018, Grand Canyon University has transitioned from for-profit to nonprofit.\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* World's largest universities\n* List of largest universities by enrollment\n* List of largest United States university campuses by enrollment\n* List of largest United States universities by undergraduate enrollment\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** IPEDS Datacenter United States Department of Education.\n2. **^** IPEDS Datacenter\n3. **^** IPEDS Datacenter\n4. **^** \"Enrollment | CSU\".\n5. **^** \"University of California | 1: Undergraduate Admissions and Enrollment\".\n6. **^** \"About Wake Tech\". 21 December 2021.\n\n## External links[edit]\n\n\n* Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System, U.S. Department of Education.

With over 2,400 annual members, Block \"O\" serves as the official student cheering section at athletic events for the university. According to the Student Organization Office in the Ohio Union, Agricultural Education Society is the oldest student organization on campus. The Men's Glee Club often disputes the claim, but after consultation with Ohio Union Staff, Agricultural Education Society was named as the university's oldest organization.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWith the onset of the Great Depression, Ohio State would face many of the challenges affecting universities throughout America as budget support was slashed, and students without the means of paying tuition returned home to support families. By the mid-1930s, however, enrollment had stabilized due in large part to the role of the Federal Emergency Relief Administration and later the National Youth Administration.[13] By the end of the decade, enrollment had still managed to grow to over 17,500. In 1934, the Ohio State Research Foundation was founded to bring in outside funding for faculty research projects. In 1938, a development office was opened to begin raising funds privately to offset reductions in state support.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Marion\n* Newark\n* Wooster\n |\n| Newspaper | *The Lantern* |\n| Colors | Scarlet\u00a0and\u00a0gray[7]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 |\n| Nickname | Buckeyes |\n| Sporting affiliations\n | * NCAA Division I FBS \u2013 Big Ten\n* WCHA\n* PRC\n* MIVA\n* ORCC\n |\n| Mascot | Brutus Buckeye |\n| Website | osu.edu ![Edit this at Wikidata](image) |\n| ![](image) |\n\n\n**The Ohio State University**, commonly called **Ohio State** or **OSU**, is a public land-grant research university in Columbus, Ohio. A member of the University System of Ohio, Ohio State was founded in 1870 as the state's land-grant university and the ninth university in Ohio with the Morrill Act of 1862. It is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities \u2013 Very high research activity\". The university's endowment of $7.4 billion in 2023 is among the largest in the world. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n[64] It is also named as one of the most innovative universities in the nation (U.S. News & World Report) and in the world (Reuters).[64] In a 2007 report released by the National Science Foundation, Ohio State's research expenditures for 2006 were $652 million, placing it seventh among public universities and 11th overall, also ranking third among all American universities for private industry-sponsored research. Research expenditures at Ohio State were $864 million in 2017. In 2006, Ohio State announced it would designate at least $110 million of its research efforts toward what it termed \"fundamental concerns\" such as research toward a cure for cancer, renewable energy sources and sustainable drinking water supplies.[65] In 2021, President Kristina M. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOhio State operates North America's 18th-largest university research library with a combined collection of over 5.8 million volumes. Additionally, the libraries regularly receive about 35,000 serial titles. Its recent acquisitions were 16th among university research libraries in North America.[11] Along with 21 libraries on its Columbus campus, the university has eight branches at off-campus research facilities and regional campuses, and a book storage depository near campus. In all, the Ohio State library system encompasses 55 branches and specialty collections. Some more significant collections include the Byrd Polar Research Center Archival Program, which has the archives of Admiral Richard E. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nLargest United States universities by undergraduate enrollment\n |\n| --- |\n| * Central Florida\n* Texas A&M\n* Ohio State\n* Pennsylvania State\n* Texas\n* Florida International\n* Arizona State\n* Michigan State\n* Florida\n* Illinois\n |\n| (2018\u201319 Academic Year)\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nPublic universities in Ohio\n |\n| --- |\n| * Akron\n* Bowling Green State\n* Central State\n* Cincinnati\n* Cleveland State\n* Kent State\n* Miami\n* Northeast Ohio Medical University\n* Ohio State\n* Ohio\n* Shawnee State\n* Toledo\n* Wright State\n* Youngstown State\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe graduation rate of Black males at the Ohio State University is higher than that of other Big Ten Schools.

The calculation used here takes into account a school's academic quality level versus the net cost of attendance for a student who received the average level of need-based financial aid.[114]\n\n\nIn 2018, *Diverse: Issues In Higher Education* ranked FIU first in granting bachelor's degrees, seventh in granting master's degrees, and 27th in granting doctoral degrees to minorities in the United States.[115]\n\n\nIn 2013, *U.S. News & World Report* reported that FIU students are among the least indebted college students in the nation, and recognized the university as a \"best buy\" in higher education. The organization also reported FIU for having one of the safest campus in the United States.[116]\n\n\nIn 2010, FIU was listed as one of 16 universities with the toughest grading system nationally.[117]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nApproximately 1,100 undergraduate students ( or approximately 2%) are members of either a fraternity or sorority.[175] The Office of Fraternity and Sorority Life at Florida International University is separated into four divisions: Interfraternity Council (IFC), National Panhellenic Conference (NPC), Multicultural Greek Council (MGC), and the National Pan-Hellenic Council (NPHC). The Order of Omega, a Greek honor society, has had a chapter at the university since 1991 and represents the academic top three percent of FIU Greeks.[176]\n\n\nThe Interfraternity Council (IFC) comprises 12 fraternities, and the Panhellenic Council is made up of 7 sororities.\n\n\nThe Multicultural Greek Council consists of 7 cultural organizations (Latino, Asian, South Asian, etc.), three fraternities and four sororities. The National Pan-Hellenic Council comprises nine historically black organizations, five fraternities and four sororities.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nUniversity Park accounted for 87% of the student population and 94% of housing students. The Biscayne Bay Campus accounted for about 13% of the student population, mostly of lower-division undergraduates and students of the School of Hospitality & Tourism Management. According to *U.S. News* college rankings and reviews, 92% of FIU students live off-campus, while 8% of students live in \"college-owned, college-operated or college-affiliated\" housing.[103]\n\n\n\n### Rankings[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Academic rankings |\n| --- |\n| National |\n| *ARWU*[104] | 107-127 |\n| *Forbes*[105] | 120 |\n| *U.S. News & World Report*[106] | 151 |\n| *Washington Monthly*[107] | 19 |\n| *WSJ*/*College Pulse*[108] | 29 |\n| Global |\n| *ARWU*[109] | 401-500 |\n| *QS*[110] | 751-800 |\n| *THE*[111] | 401-500 |\n| *U.S. News & World Report*[112] | 461 |\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFor 2022, *U.S. News & World Report* ranked Florida International University as the 34th most innovative university in the United States.

Eighty percent of the student body had just graduated from Dade County Junior College (now Miami-Dade College). A typical student entering FIU was 25 years old and attending school full-time while holding down a full-time job. Forty-three percent were married. Negotiations with the University of Miami and Dade County Junior College led FIU to open as an upper-division only school; Perry's vision foresaw a \"no gimmicks\" institution with no student housing.[24] It would be nine years before lower-division classes were added.[16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Teams | * FIU Panthers\n* Baseball\n* Men's basketball\n* Women's basketball\n* Football\n* Soccer\n |\n| Arenas and stadiums | * Infinity Insurance Park (Baseball)\n* Ocean Bank Convocation Center (Basketball)\n* FIU Stadium (Football)\n |\n| Culture and lore | * Conference USA\n* FIU Fight Song\n* Shula Bowl\n |\n\n |\n| Culture and lore | * Greek Life\n* Housing\n* Order of the Torch\n* South Beach Wine and Food Festival\n* University Park\n* University traditions\n |\n| Media | * FIU Student Media\n* Gulf Stream Magazine\n* *Hospitality Review*\n* *PantherNOW*\n* *The Roar*\n |\n| Campus | * Biscayne Bay Campus\n* Mourning Senior High\n* Engineering Center\n* FIU Tianjin Center\n* FIU Pines Center\n* Frost Art Museum\n* History of Florida International University\n* Jewish Museum of Florida\n* MAST @ FIU\n* University Park\n* Wertheim Performing Arts Center\n* Wolfsonian-FIU\n |\n| * **Founded**: 1965\n* **Students**: 58,787\n* **Endowment**: 216.3 million\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n97. **^** \"FIU Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine to welcome class of 2014\".
