The first vice-premier takes over duties of the premier at the time of the latter's incapacity. The incumbent vice premiers, in order of rank, are Ding Xuexiang, He Lifeng, Zhang Guoqing and Liu Guozhong.\n\n\nThe highest-ranked office holder is informally called the **Senior Vice Premier** or **First Vice Premier** (Chinese: \u7b2c\u4e00\u526f\u603b\u7406) or **Executive Vice Premier** (Chinese: \u5e38\u52a1\u526f\u603b\u7406), a most prominent case being Deng Xiaoping in the mid-to-late 1970s.[2][3] In irregular instances, the position of a senior vice premier has been named either to indicate degree of power, nominal power, or when the premier is incapacitated and requires a full-time deputy to carry out his regular duties.\n\n\n\n\n## Selection[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n![National Emblem of the People's Republic of China](image) State Council of the People's Republic of China\n |\n| --- |\n| Incumbent (14th): Li Qiang Cabinet\n |\n| State Council | \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Members | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Executivemeeting | * Premier\n* Vice Premiers\n* State Councilors\n* Secretary-General\n |\n| * Ministers in charge of ministries/commissions\n* Auditor-General\n |\n\n |\n| Departments | * Foreign\n* Defense\n* Development\n* Education\n* Science\n* Industry and Information Tech\n* Ethnic\n* Public Security\n* State Security\n* Civil\n* Justice\n* Finance\n* Human Resources and Social Security\n* Natural Resources\n* Ecology and Environment\n* Housing\n* Transport\n* Water\n* Agriculture\n* Commerce\n* Culture and Tourism\n* Health\n* Veterans\n* Emergency\n* People's Bank\n* Audit Office\n |\n\n |\n| Agencies | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOfficially, the vice premiers are appointed by the National People's Congress (NPC) upon the nomination of the premier.[4] The NPC also has the power to remove the vice premiers and other state officers from office. Elections and removals are decided by majority vote.[4] In practice, the vice premiers are chosen within the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leadership, including the Politburo Standing Committee.[5]\n\n\nThe length of the vice premier's term of office is the same as the NPC, which is 5 years, and the vice premiers are restricted to two consecutive terms.[4] Immediately after the election, the president signs the presidential order formalizing the appointment of the vice premiers. Since 2018, the vice premiers are required to collectively recite the constitutional oath of office before assuming office.[5]\n\n\n\n## Powers and authority[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Vice Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Simplified Chinese | \u4e2d\u534e\u4eba\u6c11\u5171\u548c\u56fd\u56fd\u52a1\u9662\u526f\u603b\u7406 |\n| Traditional\u00a0Chinese | \u4e2d\u83ef\u4eba\u6c11\u5171\u548c\u570b\u570b\u52d9\u9662\u526f\u7e3d\u7406 |\n| \n\n| Transcriptions |\n| --- |\n| Standard Mandarin |\n| Hanyu Pinyin | Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 R\u00e9nm\u00edn G\u00f2ngh\u00e9gu\u00f3 Gu\u00f3w\u00f9yu\u00e0n F\u00f9z\u01d2ngl\u01d0 |\n| Wade\u2013Giles | Chung1-hua2 J\u00ean2-min2 Kung4-ho2-kuo2 Kuo2-wu4-y\u00fcan4 Fu4-tsung3-li3 |\n\n |\n| Alternative Chinese name |\n| Simplified Chinese | \u56fd\u52a1\u9662\u526f\u603b\u7406 |\n| Traditional\u00a0Chinese | \u570b\u52d9\u9662\u526f\u7e3d\u7406 |\n| \n\n| Transcriptions |\n| --- |\n| Standard Mandarin |\n| Hanyu Pinyin | Gu\u00f3w\u00f9yu\u00e0n F\u00f9z\u01d2ngl\u01d0 |\n| Wade\u2013Giles | Kuo2-wu4-y\u00fcan4 Fu4-tsung3-li3 |\n\n |\n|  |\n\n\n\n\n| Politics of China\n |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) |\n|  |\n| Leadership\nLeadership generations\nSuccession of power\n* Hu\u2013Wen Administration (2002\u20132012)\n* Xi\u2013Li Administration (2012\u20132017)\n* Xi Administration (since 2017)\n\t+ 4th Leadership Core: Xi Jinping\n\t+ 20th Party Politburo: Xi Jinping\n\t+ 14th State Council: Li Qiang\n\t+ Current state leaders\n\t+ Current provincial leaders\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Vice Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China |\n| --- |\n| \u4e2d\u534e\u4eba\u6c11\u5171\u548c\u56fd\u56fd\u52a1\u9662\u526f\u603b\u7406 |\n| ![](image)National Emblem of the People's Republic of China\n |\n| ![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n**IncumbentDing XuexiangHe LifengZhang GuoqingLiu Guozhong**since\u00a012 March 2023\n |\n| State Council of the People's Republic of China |\n| Style | Vice Premier (\u526f\u603b\u7406)(informal) |\n| Member of | * Plenary Meeting of the State Council\n* Executive Meeting of the State Council\n |\n| Reports to | Premier of the State Council |\n| Residence | Premier's Office, Zhongnanhai |\n| Seat | Beijing |\n| Nominator | Premier of the State Council |\n| Appointer | Presidentpursuant to a National People's Congress decision |\n| Term length | Five years, renewable once consecutively |\n| Precursor | Vice Premier of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government |\n| Inaugural holder | Chen Yun |\n| Formation | September\u00a01954; 69\u00a0years ago\u00a0(1954-09) |\n| Website | State Council |\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n4.

This allows the Standing Committee to oversee a wide range of government functions. [9] Each State Councillor performs duties as designated by the Premier. The secretary-general heads the General Office which handles the day-to-day work of the State Council.[10][*non-primary source needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* + President (list): Xi Jinping\n\t\n\t\t- Presidential Office\n\t\tChief: Cai Qi\n\t+ Vice President: Han Zheng\n\nExecutive organ\n\n* + State Council (Central People's Government)\n\t\t- Li Qiang Cabinet\n\t\tPremier\u00a0(list): Li Qiang\n\t\t\n\t\tVice-Premiers (list)\n\t\t* Ding Xuexiang\n\t\t\t* He Lifeng\n\t\t\t* Zhang Guoqing\n\t\t\t* Liu Guozhong\n\t\t\n\t\tState Councilors\n\t\t* Wang Xiaohong\n\t\t\t* Wu Zhenglong\n\t\t\t* Shen Yiqin\n\t\t\n\t\tSecretary-General: Wu Zhenglong\n\t\t\n\t\t\t* Cabinet-level departments\n\t\t\t\t+ National Development & Reform Commission\n\t\t\t\t+ Central bank\n\t\t\t\t+ National Audit Office\n\t\t- General Office\n\t\tSecretary-General\n\t\tDeputy Secretaries-General\n\t\t- State-owned Assets Supervision & Administration Commission\n\t\t\t* most Central Enterprises\n\nMilitary organ\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe premier is responsible for the State Council and exercises overall leadership of its work. The secretary-general of the State Council, under the leadership of the premier, is responsible for handling the daily work of the State Council and heads the General Office of the State Council. The executive meeting of the State Council, consisting of the premier, vice premiers, state councillors and the secretary-general, meets two to three times a month, while the plenary session, consisting of all members of the State Council, meets every six months\n\n\nThe State Council directly oversees provincial-level People's Governments, and in practice maintains membership with the top levels of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Aside from a few, members of the State Council are also members of the CCP's Central Committee.\n\n\n\n\n## Organization[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Constituent departments of the State Council\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nState Council of the  \nPeople's Republic of China| \u4e2d\u534e\u4eba\u6c11\u5171\u548c\u56fd\u56fd\u52a1\u9662Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 R\u00e9nm\u00edn G\u00f2ngh\u00e9gu\u00f3 Gu\u00f3w\u00f9yu\u00e0n |\n| ![](image)Emblem of the People's Republic of China\n |\n| Agency overview |\n| Formed | 27\u00a0September 1954; 69 years ago\u00a0(1954-09-27) |\n| Preceding agency | * Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government (1949\u20131954)\n |\n| Type | Executive body of the National People's CongressHighest organ of State administration |\n| Jurisdiction | Government of the People's Republic of China |\n| Headquarters | State Council Office Area, Zhongnanhai, Beijing |\n| Annual budget | CN\u00a537.2 trillion (2019)[1] |\n| Agency executives | * Li Qiang, Premier\n* Ding Xuexiang, He Lifeng, Zhang Guoqing, Liu Guozhong, Vice Premiers\n* Wang Xiaohong, Wu Zhenglong, Shen Yiqin, State councillors\n |\n| Child agencies | * General Office\n* 26 Constituent Departments (cabinet-level)\n |\n| Website | english.www.gov.cn ![Edit this at Wikidata](image) |\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Unraveling the Mysteries of China's Multiple Budgets\". *Bloomberg.com*. 13 March 2020.
