The first vice-premier takes over duties of the premier at the time of the latter's incapacity. The incumbent vice premiers, in order of rank, are Ding Xuexiang, He Lifeng, Zhang Guoqing and Liu Guozhong.\n\n\nThe highest-ranked office holder is informally called the **Senior Vice Premier** or **First Vice Premier** (Chinese: 第一副总理) or **Executive Vice Premier** (Chinese: 常务副总理), a most prominent case being Deng Xiaoping in the mid-to-late 1970s.[2][3] In irregular instances, the position of a senior vice premier has been named either to indicate degree of power, nominal power, or when the premier is incapacitated and requires a full-time deputy to carry out his regular duties.\n\n\n\n\n## Selection[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n![National Emblem of the People's Republic of China](image) State Council of the People's Republic of China\n |\n| --- |\n| Incumbent (14th): Li Qiang Cabinet\n |\n| State Council | \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Members | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Executivemeeting | * Premier\n* Vice Premiers\n* State Councilors\n* Secretary-General\n |\n| * Ministers in charge of ministries/commissions\n* Auditor-General\n |\n\n |\n| Departments | * Foreign\n* Defense\n* Development\n* Education\n* Science\n* Industry and Information Tech\n* Ethnic\n* Public Security\n* State Security\n* Civil\n* Justice\n* Finance\n* Human Resources and Social Security\n* Natural Resources\n* Ecology and Environment\n* Housing\n* Transport\n* Water\n* Agriculture\n* Commerce\n* Culture and Tourism\n* Health\n* Veterans\n* Emergency\n* People's Bank\n* Audit Office\n |\n\n |\n| Agencies | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOfficially, the vice premiers are appointed by the National People's Congress (NPC) upon the nomination of the premier.[4] The NPC also has the power to remove the vice premiers and other state officers from office. Elections and removals are decided by majority vote.[4] In practice, the vice premiers are chosen within the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leadership, including the Politburo Standing Committee.[5]\n\n\nThe length of the vice premier's term of office is the same as the NPC, which is 5 years, and the vice premiers are restricted to two consecutive terms.[4] Immediately after the election, the president signs the presidential order formalizing the appointment of the vice premiers. Since 2018, the vice premiers are required to collectively recite the constitutional oath of office before assuming office.[5]\n\n\n\n## Powers and authority[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Vice Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Simplified Chinese | 中华人民共和国国务院副总理 |\n| Traditional Chinese | 中華人民共和國國務院副總理 |\n| \n\n| Transcriptions |\n| --- |\n| Standard Mandarin |\n| Hanyu Pinyin | Zhōnghuá Rénmín Gònghéguó Guówùyuàn Fùzǒnglǐ |\n| Wade–Giles | Chung1-hua2 Jên2-min2 Kung4-ho2-kuo2 Kuo2-wu4-yüan4 Fu4-tsung3-li3 |\n\n |\n| Alternative Chinese name |\n| Simplified Chinese | 国务院副总理 |\n| Traditional Chinese | 國務院副總理 |\n| \n\n| Transcriptions |\n| --- |\n| Standard Mandarin |\n| Hanyu Pinyin | Guówùyuàn Fùzǒnglǐ |\n| Wade–Giles | Kuo2-wu4-yüan4 Fu4-tsung3-li3 |\n\n |\n|  |\n\n\n\n\n| Politics of China\n |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) |\n|  |\n| Leadership\nLeadership generations\nSuccession of power\n* Hu–Wen Administration (2002–2012)\n* Xi–Li Administration (2012–2017)\n* Xi Administration (since 2017)\n\t+ 4th Leadership Core: Xi Jinping\n\t+ 20th Party Politburo: Xi Jinping\n\t+ 14th State Council: Li Qiang\n\t+ Current state leaders\n\t+ Current provincial leaders\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Vice Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China |\n| --- |\n| 中华人民共和国国务院副总理 |\n| ![](image)National Emblem of the People's Republic of China\n |\n| ![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n**IncumbentDing XuexiangHe LifengZhang GuoqingLiu Guozhong**since 12 March 2023\n |\n| State Council of the People's Republic of China |\n| Style | Vice Premier (副总理)(informal) |\n| Member of | * Plenary Meeting of the State Council\n* Executive Meeting of the State Council\n |\n| Reports to | Premier of the State Council |\n| Residence | Premier's Office, Zhongnanhai |\n| Seat | Beijing |\n| Nominator | Premier of the State Council |\n| Appointer | Presidentpursuant to a National People's Congress decision |\n| Term length | Five years, renewable once consecutively |\n| Precursor | Vice Premier of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government |\n| Inaugural holder | Chen Yun |\n| Formation | September 1954; 69 years ago (1954-09) |\n| Website | State Council |\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n4.

Between meetings it is guided by a Executive Meeting of the State Council [zh] which is held two to three times a month, and can be called at the discretion of the premier.[13] The Executive Meeting is composed of the premier, vice premiers, state councilors, and the secretary-general.[3][*non-primary source needed*]\n\n\n\n## Members[edit]\n\n\n### Executive Meeting[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t\t- Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (20th)\n\t\t\t* Standing Committee (20th)\n\t\t\tSecretary: Li Xi\n\t\t\t* Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Central Military Commission\n\t\t\tSecretary: Zhang Shengmin\n\t\t\t* Central Leading Group for Inspection Work\n\t\t\tLeader: Li Xi\n\n---\n\n\n\t+ Provincial committee\n\t\t- Standing committee\n\t\tSecretary\n\t\tDeputy secretaries\n\t+ Party group\n |\n| National People's Congress (14th)\n* Elections\n* Standing Committee (14th)\n\t+ Council of Chairpersons\n\tChairman: Zhao Leji\n\t\n\tVice-Chairpersons\n\tTop-ranked: Li Hongzhong\n\tSecretary-General: Liu Qi\n\t+ Special Committees\n\t\t1.
