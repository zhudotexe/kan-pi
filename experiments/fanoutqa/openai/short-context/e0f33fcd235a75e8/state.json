The team finished the season with a record of 73\u20139.[86] On May 10, 2016, Stephen Curry was named the NBA's Most Valuable Player (MVP) for the second straight season. Curry is the 11th player to win back-to-back MVP honors and became the first player in NBA history to win the MVP award by unanimous vote, winning all 131 first-place votes.[87] Stephen Curry, Draymond Green and Klay Thompson were all named to the 2016 All-Star Game. Green broke the Golden State franchise record of nine triple-doubles in a season. Curry broke numerous three-point records during the season, including his own NBA record for made three-pointers in a season of 286; he finished the season with 402 three-pointers. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nGolden State Warriors\n |\n| --- |\n| * Founded in **1946**\n* Played in **Philadelphia** (1946\u20131962) and **Oakland** (1971\u20132019)\n* Based in **San Francisco, California**\n |\n| Franchise | * History\n* All-time roster\n* Draft history\n* Head coaches\n* Seasons\n* **Current season**\n |\n| Arenas | * Philadelphia Arena\n* Philadelphia Convention Hall\n* Cow Palace\n* San Francisco Civic Auditorium\n* USF War Memorial Gymnasium\n* San Diego Sports Arena\n* San Jose Arena\n* Oracle Arena\n* **Chase Center**\n |\n| Personnel | Owner(s)\nJoe Lacob (majority)\nPeter Guber\nPresident\nBrandon Schneider\nGeneral manager\nMike Dunleavy Jr.\nHead coach\nSteve Kerr\n |\n| G League affiliate | * Santa Cruz Warriors\n |\n| Retired numbers | * 13\n* 14\n* 16\n* 17\n* 24\n* 42\n |\n| NBA championships | * 1947\n* 1956\n* 1975\n* 2015\n* 2017\n* 2018\n* 2022\n |\n| Rivalries | * Cleveland Cavaliers\n* Los Angeles Lakers\n* Sacramento Kings\n |\n| Culture and lore | * 73\u20139\n* Dance Cam Mom\n* Death Lineup\n* \"Good Feeling\"\n* *Hangin' with Mr. Cooper*\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn April 10, 2022, the Warriors clinched the third seed in the Western conference, qualifying for the playoffs for the first time since the 2018\u201319 season. In the first round, they advanced past the Denver Nuggets, and triumphed over the Memphis Grizzlies in the conference semi-finals. On May 26, 2022, the Warriors advanced to their seventh NBA Finals after defeating the Dallas Mavericks in the Western Conference Finals, 4\u20131. On June 16, 2022, the team won their seventh NBA title, beating the Boston Celtics 4\u20132.

Even without Bogut, the Warriors battled the third-seed Los Angeles Clippers to a seventh and deciding game in the first round of the playoffs before their 2013\u201314 season came to an end. It was a season of many thrilling moments; the Warriors played in 17 regular-season games decided by two points or less, six games decided by winning shots in the final three seconds, and seven comeback wins in which the Warriors had been behind by 15 points or more.[62] Curry also made his first appearance in the All-Star Game in 2014.

The team ranked first in defensive efficiency for the season and second in offensive efficiency, barely missing the mark that the Julius Erving-led Sixers achieved by being first in both offensive and defensive efficiency. On May 4, Stephen Curry was named the 2014\u201315 NBA Most Valuable Player, the first Warrior since Wilt Chamberlain in 1960.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe franchise adopted its brand name Golden State Warriors prior to the 1971\u201372 season, to suggest that the team represented the entire state of California.[15][a] Almost all home games were played in Oakland that season; six were played in San Diego, but none in San Francisco or Daly City. Oakland Arena became the team's exclusive home court in 1971.\n\n\nThe Warriors made the playoffs from 1971 to 1977 except in 1974, and won their first NBA championship on the West Coast in 1974\u201375. In what many consider the biggest upset in NBA history, Golden State not only defeated the heavily favored Washington Bullets but humiliated them in a four-game sweep. That team was coached by former Warrior Al Attles, and led on the court by Rick Barry and Jamaal Wilkes. Barry was named Finals MVP.[17]\n\n\nAt 59\u201323, the Warriors had the league's best record during the 1975\u201376 season.

On November 7, 2016, Stephen Curry set the NBA record for most 3-pointers in a game with 13, in a 116\u2013106 win over the Pelicans.[104] On December 5, 2016, Klay Thompson scored 60 points in 29 minutes, in a 142\u2013106 victory over the Pacers. In doing so, Thompson became the first player in NBA history to score 60 or more points in fewer than 30 minutes of playing time.[105] Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green, and Klay Thompson were all named to the 2017 NBA All-Star Game, making the Warriors only the eighth team in NBA history to have four All-Stars.[106] On February 10, 2017, Draymond Green recorded a triple-double with 12 rebounds, 10 assists, and 10 steals, becoming the first player in NBA history to post a triple-double with fewer than 10 points.[107] On March 2, 2017, the Warriors' streak for most games without back-to-back losses ended at 146 with a 94\u201387 loss to the Chicago Bulls. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHe made a three-pointer in 151 consecutive games, which broke the NBA record of 127 set by Kyle Korver in 2014. On February 27, 2016, Curry also tied the NBA record of twelve three-pointers made in a single game, jointly holding it with Donyell Marshall and Kobe Bryant.[88]\n\n\nThe Warriors reached the NBA Finals for the second consecutive year, facing a rematch against the Cleveland Cavaliers.[89] The Warriors won three of the first four games of the 2016 NBA Finals, but the Cavaliers made a comeback to tie the series at three wins apiece.[90] Draymond Green was suspended for Game Five of the series, and Curry was ejected from Game Six.[91] In Game Seven, the Warriors lost the series on their home court, earning the distinction of becoming the first team to lose the NBA Finals after having led three games to one.[92]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe team struggled in the 1980s, then became playoff regulars at the turn of the decade with stars Tim Hardaway, Mitch Richmond, and Chris Mullin, nicknamed \"Run TMC\". Led by Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green, the team returned to championship glory in 2015, with defensive swingman Andre Iguodala being named Finals MVP. In 2016, the Warriors set the record for best regular season record at 73-9 before losing the Finals to the Cleveland Cavaliers (against whom they played a record four straight finals) and becoming the first team to lose a series after leading 3\u20131 in the Finals. After signing former MVP Kevin Durant, the team won back-to-back championships in 2017 and 2018 (Durant winning both Finals MVPs). They lost the 2019 Finals to the Toronto Raptors, a series which saw Durant and Thompson suffer serious Achilles and ACL injuries, respectively; Durant left that off-season. \n</fragment>\n</document>",

The Cavaliers compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Central Division of the Eastern Conference. The team began play as an expansion team in 1970, along with the Portland Trail Blazers and Buffalo Braves. Home games were first held at Cleveland Arena from 1970 to 1974, followed by the Richfield Coliseum from 1974 to 1994. Since 1994, the Cavs have played home games at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse in downtown Cleveland, which is shared with the Cleveland Monsters of the American Hockey League. Dan Gilbert has owned the team since March 2005.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the 2021\u201322 season, the Cavs finished 44\u201338 and eighth in the Eastern Conference, and qualified for the NBA play-in tournament, marking the first time the team played in the event. This also marks the team's first postseason basketball since 2017\u201318 and the first time a non-LeBron-led team qualified for postseason play since 1997\u201398. The team, however, didn't make it out of the play-in tournament, losing the 7-seed vs. 8-seed game to the Brooklyn Nets and the 8-seed vs. 9-seed game to the Atlanta Hawks, ending their season.\n\n\nOn March 26, 2023, the Cavaliers clinched a spot in the NBA playoffs, making this the first time since 2018 that the team entered the playoffs, with a 108\u201391 win over the Houston Rockets. This was also the first time since 1998 that the team entered the playoffs without LeBron James.[67] They wound up losing their first round playoff series to the New York Knicks four games to one.[68]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Cavaliers opened their inaugural season by losing their first 15 games and struggled in their early years, placing no better than sixth in the Eastern Conference during their first five seasons. The team won their first Central Division title in 1976, which also marked the first winning season and playoff appearance in franchise history, where they advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals. The franchise was purchased by Ted Stepien in 1980. Stepien's tenure as owner was marked by six coaching changes, questionable trades and draft decisions, and poor attendance, leading to $15 million in financial losses. The Cavs went 66\u2013180 over the course of those three seasons and endured a 24-game losing streak spanning the 1981\u201382 and 1982\u201383 seasons.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n6. **^** \"Cleveland Cavaliers sign Cliffs jersey patch deal\". *Cavs.com* (Press release).

The Knicks then signed veteran power forward Kenyon Martin to a 10-day contract. In late March, the Knicks went on to compile a four-game losing streak, tying their worst skid of the season. They would go on and face the Jazz on the road, eventually winning the game and starting what would turn out to be a 13-game winning streak, including wins against the Miami Heat and the Oklahoma City Thunder. This was the third-longest winning streak in franchise history. On April 9, the Knicks beat the Washington Wizards to secure the Atlantic Division title for the first time since the 1993\u201394 NBA season. The Knicks' 13-game winning streak came to an end on April 11 as they lost to the Chicago Bulls. Despite that, they set the NBA single-season record for three-pointers. On May 3, the Knicks defeated the Boston Celtics in the first round of the NBA playoffs, 4\u20132, their first playoff victory since 2000. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the 1969\u201370 season, the Knicks had a then-single-season NBA record 18 straight victories en route to a 60\u201322 record, which was the best regular season record in the franchise's history to that point.[39][40] After defeating the Bullets in the Eastern Division semifinals and the Milwaukee Bucks in the Eastern Division finals, the Knicks faced the Los Angeles Lakers in the NBA Finals.[39] With the series tied at 2\u20132, the Knicks would be tested in Game 5. Willis Reed tore a muscle in his right leg in the second quarter, and was lost for the rest of the game.[41] Despite his absence, New York went on to win the game, rallying from a 16-point deficit.[41]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe playoff-level Knicks of the 1990s were led by future Hall of Fame center Patrick Ewing; this era was marked by passionate rivalries with the Chicago Bulls, Indiana Pacers, and Miami Heat. During this time, they were known for playing tough defense under head coaches Pat Riley and Jeff Van Gundy, making NBA Finals appearances in 1994 and 1999. However, they were unable to win an NBA championship during this era.\n\n\nSince 2000, the Knicks have struggled to regain their former successes, but won their first division title in 19 years in 2012\u201313, led by a core of forwards Carmelo Anthony and Amar'e Stoudemire. They were eventually eliminated in the Eastern Conference semifinals by the Indiana Pacers, and had failed to make the playoffs for eight years until 2020\u201321 when they were led by forward Julius Randle and sophomore RJ Barrett, who was selected third overall in the 2019 NBA draft.[9]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of New York Knicks seasons\n\n### 1946\u20131967: early years[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nUnder Woodson, the Knicks finished 18\u20136 during the regular season and clinched a playoff spot for the second straight year this time as the seventh seed, making it the first time they have clinched consecutive playoff berths since making 13 straight playoff appearances from 1988 to 2001.[30][151] Not only did they also clinch consecutive winning seasons for the first time in a decade, but their 36\u201330 record was the highest winning percentage for the team since the 2000\u201301 season.[30] The Knicks faced the Miami Heat in the first round of the playoffs and lost the first three games, breaking the NBA record for longest playoff losing streak at 13 games.[152] The team's struggles were partially attributed to injuries as Jeremy Lin, Baron Davis and Iman Shumpert were all sidelined by knee ailments.[153] The Knicks proceeded to win a close Game 4, which snapped their streak and ensured that they would not be swept out of the first round; however, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDespite playing without an injured Iman Shumpert and Amar'e Stoudemire, the Knicks compiled an 18\u20135 record to start the season, their best start since 1993. In their first four games, they scored at least 100 points and won by double digits in all of those games. The streak ended after a 10-point loss to Memphis Grizzlies. The following Sunday, in a game against the Indiana Pacers, the Knicks at home went on to win 88\u201376, assuring them a 7\u20131 record. After two tough losses to the Dallas Mavericks and Houston Rockets, the Knicks returned home in a game against the Detroit Pistons on November 25, with a 121\u2013100 blowout win, making them one of only three teams undefeated at home along with the Miami Heat and Utah Jazz. The Knicks finished November with an 11\u20134 record, their best month record since going 11\u20136 in March 2000.[158] By the All-Star break in mid-February 2013, the Knicks compiled a 32\u201318 record, good for second in the Eastern Conference. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNational Basketball Association team in New York City\n\nThis article is about the professional basketball team.

This was the second consecutive year that the Raptors clinched the Atlantic Division title.[150] On April 11, 2015, the Raptors beat the Miami Heat, Toronto's first road win over the Heat since November 19, 2008, ending a ten-game slide on Miami's home floor. The win was Toronto's 48th of the season and 22nd on the road, both tying franchise records.[151] Four days later, the Raptors broke their franchise record with their 49th win of the season. After the 2014\u201315 season, Louis Williams won the NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award, becoming the first Raptor to do so. The Raptors faced the Washington Wizards in the first round of the 2015 playoffs and lost four straight games as the Wizards swept the Raptors.[152]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n145. **^** \"Raptors Acquire Vasquez, Salmons, Hayes & Patterson From Kings\". *www.nba.com*.
