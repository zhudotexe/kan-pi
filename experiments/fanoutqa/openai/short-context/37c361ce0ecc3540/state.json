In general, the land is high in the west and descends to the east coast. Mountains (33 percent), plateaus (26 percent) and hills (10 percent) account for nearly 70 percent of the country's land surface. Most of the country's arable land and population are based in lowland plains (12 percent) and basins (19 percent), though some of the greatest basins are filled with deserts. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nGeography of China (\u4e2d\u56fd\u5730\u7406)| ![Geographic Map of China](image) |\n| Continent | Asia |\n| Region | East/Southeast Asia |\n| Coordinates | 35\u00b00\u2032N 105\u00b00\u2032E\ufeff / \ufeff35.000\u00b0N 105.000\u00b0E\ufeff / 35.000; 105.000[1] |\n| Area | Ranked 3 |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Total | 9,596,960[1]\u00a0km2 (3,705,410\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Land | 97.2[1]% |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Water | 2.8[1]% |\n| Coastline | 14,500[1]\u00a0km (9,000\u00a0mi) |\n| Borders | Afghanistan, Bhutan, Burma, India, North Korea, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan, Vietnam |\n| Highest point | Mount Everest, 8,848\u00a0m (29,029\u00a0ft)[2] |\n| Lowest point | Turpan Pendi, \u2212154\u00a0m (\u2212505\u00a0ft)[1] |\n| Longest river | Yangtze River[3] |\n| Largest lake | Qinghai Lake[*citation needed*] |\n| Climate | diverse; ranges from tropical in south to subarctic in north[1] |\n| Terrain | mostly mountains, high plateaus, deserts in west and plains, deltas and hills in east[1] |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe People's Republic of China has an area of about 9,600,000\u00a0km2 (3,700,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). The exact land area is sometimes challenged by border disputes, most notably about Taiwan, Aksai Chin, the Trans-Karakoram Tract, and South Tibet. The area of the People's Republic of China is 9,596,960\u00a0km2 (3,705,410\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) according to the CIA's *The World Factbook*.[1] The People's Republic of China is either the third or fourth-largest country in the world, being either slightly larger or slightly smaller than the United States, depending on how the area of the United States is measured. Both countries are smaller than Russia and Canada and larger than Brazil.\n\n\n\n![](image)\nSouth China Sea by Hainan.\n![](image)\nLuoping in Yunnan.\n\n\n## Physical geography[edit]\n\n\n### Generalities[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAccording to the World Bank, as of 2015, China's total arable land was estimated at 119,000,000 hectares.[11] Since 2005, arable land in China has been on the decline and the total arable land per citizen has reached .2 acres.[12] As a percentage, agricultural land makes up about 54.7% of land. The climate of the country is difficult to describe because it varies so much depending on the region of China. The southernmost parts of the country are almost tropical, while the northernmost part is subarctic.[13]\n\n*Click any region for more info.

The eastern plains and southern coasts of the country consist of fertile lowlands and foothills. They are the location of most of China's agricultural output and human population. The southern areas of the country (south of the Yangtze River) consist of hilly and mountainous terrain. The west and north of the country are dominated by sunken basins (such as the Gobi and the Taklamakan), rolling plateaus, and towering massifs. It contains part of the highest tableland on earth, the Tibetan Plateau, and has much lower agricultural potential and population.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n\n### Land use[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Land use in China\n\nBased on 2005 estimates, 14.86% (about 1,400,000\u00a0km2 (540,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi)) of China's total land area is arable. About 1.3% (some 116,580\u00a0km\u00b2) is planted to permanent crops and the rest planted to temporary crops. With comparatively little land planted to permanent crops, intensive agricultural techniques are used to reap harvests that are sufficient to feed the world's largest population and still have surplus for export. An estimated 544,784\u00a0km\u00b2 of land were irrigated in 2004. 42.9% of total land area was used as pasture, and 17.5% was forest.\n\n\n\n### Wildlife[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Wildlife of China\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** ***k*** ***l*** \"China\". *The World Factbook*.

The climate allows two crops of rice to be grown per year. Southeast of the mountains lies a coastal, hilly region of small deltas and narrow valley plains. The drainage area of the Pearl River and its associated network of rivers occupies much of the region to the south. West of the Nanling, the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau rises in two steps, averaging 1,200 and 1,800 m in elevation, respectively, toward the precipitous mountain regions of the eastern Qingzang Plateau.\n\n\n\n### Geology and natural resources[edit]\n\n\nChina has substantial mineral reserves and is the world's largest producer of antimony, natural graphite, tungsten, and zinc. Other major minerals are aluminum, bauxite, coal, crude petroleum, diamonds, gold, iron ore, lead, magnetite, manganese, mercury, molybdenum, natural gas, phosphate rock, tin, uranium, and vanadium. China's hydropower potential is the largest in the world.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe country's longest and most important waterway, the Yangtze River, is navigable for the majority of its length and has a vast hydroelectric potential. Rising on the Qingzang Plateau, the Yangtze River traverses 6,300\u00a0km (3,900\u00a0mi) through the heart of the country, draining an area of 1,800,000\u00a0km2 (690,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) before emptying into the East China Sea. Roughly 300 million people live along its middle and lower reaches. The area is a large producer of rice and wheat. The Sichuan Basin, due to its mild, humid climate and long growing season, produces a variety of crops. It is a leading silk-producing area and an important industrial region with substantial mineral resources.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nChina's territorial waters are principally marginal seas of the western Pacific Ocean. These waters lie on the indented coastline of the mainland and approximately 5,000 islands. The Yellow Sea, East China Sea, and South China Sea are marginal seas of the Pacific Ocean. More than half the coastline, predominantly in the south, is rocky; most of the remainder is sandy. The Bay of Hangzhou roughly divides the two kinds of shoreline.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBeijing, at the north tip of the North China Plain, is shielded by the intersection of the Taihang and Yan Mountains. Further north are the drier grasslands of the Inner Mongolian Plateau, traditionally home to pastoralists. To the south are agricultural regions, traditionally home to sedentary populations. The Great Wall of China was built across the mountains that mark the southern edge of the Inner Mongolian Plateau. The Ming-era walls run over 2,000\u00a0km (1,200\u00a0mi) east to west from Shanhaiguan on the Bohai coast to the Hexi Corridor in Gansu.\n\n\n\nSouth (hills)\n![](image)\nKarst landscape around Yangshuo in Guangxi\n![](image)\nNorth slope of Changbaishan in Jilin Province, near the border with North Korea.\n![](image)\nSand dunes of the Gobi Desert near Dunhuang, in Gansu Province.\n![](image)\nThe Loess Plateau near Hunyuan in Shanxi Province.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Main rivers of China\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n9. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"East Asia/Southeast Asia\u00a0:: China \u2014 The World Factbook - Central Intelligence Agency\". *www.cia.gov*.

The vertices of this triangle are Beijing to the north, Shanghai to the southeast, and Yichang to the southwest.

In the western sector, China claimed portions of the 41,000\u00a0km2 (16,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) Pamir Mountains area, a region of soaring mountain peaks and glacier-filled valleys where the borders of Afghanistan, Pakistan, the former Soviet Union, and China meet in Central Asia. North and east of this region, some sections of the border remained undemarcated in 1987. The 6,542 kilometres (4,065\u00a0mi) frontier with the Soviet Union has been a source of continual friction. In 1954 China published maps showing substantial portions of Soviet Siberian territory as its own. In the northeast, border friction with the Soviet Union produced a tense situation in remote regions of Inner Mongolia and Heilongjiang along segments of the Argun River, Amur River, and Ussuri River. Each side had massed troops and had exchanged charges of border provocation in this area. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nChina originally had an estimated number of 50,000 rivers. However, due to statistical discrepancies, water and soil loss, and climate change, there are currently only an estimated 22,000 rivers remaining.[6] The rivers in China have a total length of 420,000 kilometers. 1,500 have a catchment area exceeding 1,000 square kilometers. The majority of rivers flow west to east into the Pacific Ocean. The Yangtze (Chang Jiang) rises in Tibet, flows through Central China and enters the East China Sea near Shanghai. The Yangtze is 6,300 kilometers long and has a catchment area of 1.8 million square kilometers. It is the third longest river in the world, after the Amazon and the Nile. The second longest river in China is the Huang He (Yellow River). It rises in Tibet and travels circuitously for 5,464 kilometers through North China, it empties into the Bo Hai Gulf on the north coast of the Shandong Province. It has a catchment area of 752,000 square kilometers. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFlowing from its source in the Qingzang highlands, the Yellow River courses toward the sea through the North China Plain, the historic center of Chinese expansion and influence. Han Chinese people have farmed the rich alluvial soils since ancient times, constructing the Grand Canal for north-south transport during the Imperial Era. The plain is a continuation of the Dongbei (Manchurian) Plain to the northeast but is separated from it by the Bohai Gulf, an extension of the Yellow Sea.\n\n\nLike other densely populated areas of China, the plain is subject to floods and earthquakes. The mining and industrial center of Tangshan, 165\u00a0km (103\u00a0mi) east of Beijing, was leveled by an earthquake in July 1976, it was believed to be the largest earthquake of the 20th century by death toll.\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Canada stretches from the Atlantic Ocean in the east to the Pacific Ocean in the west; to the north lies the Arctic Ocean.[1] Greenland is to the northeast with a shared border on Hans Island. To the southeast Canada shares a maritime boundary with France's overseas collectivity of Saint Pierre and Miquelon, the last vestige of New France.[2] By total area (including its waters), Canada is the second-largest country in the world, after Russia.

It separated from Antarctica over a prolonged period beginning in the Permian and continuing through to the Cretaceous.[175] When the last glacial period ended in about 10,000 BC, rising sea levels formed Bass Strait, separating Tasmania from the mainland. Then between about 8,000 and 6,500 BC, the lowlands in the north were flooded by the sea, separating New Guinea, the Aru Islands, and the mainland of Australia.[176] The Australian continent is moving toward Eurasia at the rate of 6 to 7 centimetres a year.[177]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n45. **^** \"A note on 'Austrialia' or 'Australia' Rupert Gerritsen \u2013 Journal of The Australian and New Zealand Map Society Inc.

It is bordered by the North Sea in the north, the English Channel in the northwest, the Atlantic Ocean in the west and the Mediterranean sea in the southeast. Its land borders consist of Belgium and Luxembourg in the northeast, Germany and Switzerland in the east, Italy and Monaco in the southeast, and Andorra and Spain in the south and southwest. Except for the northeast, most of France's land borders are roughly delineated by natural boundaries and geographic features: to the south and southeast, the Pyrenees and the Alps and the Jura, respectively, and to the east, the Rhine river. Due to its shape, France is often referred to as **l'Hexagone** (\"The Hexagon\"). Metropolitan France includes various coastal islands, of which the largest is Corsica. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMetropolitan France is situated mostly between latitudes 41\u00b0 and 51\u00b0 N, and longitudes 6\u00b0 W and 10\u00b0 E, on the western edge of Europe, and thus lies within the northern temperate zone.

France possesses a wide variety of landscapes, from coastal plains in the north and west to mountain ranges of the Alps in the southeast, the Massif Central in the south-central and Pyrenees in the southwest.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMetropolitan France has a wide variety of topographical sets and natural landscapes. Large parts of the current territory of France were raised during several tectonic episodes like the Hercynian uplift in the Paleozoic Era, during which the Armorican Massif, the Massif Central, the Morvan, the Vosges and Ardennes ranges and the island of Corsica were formed. These massifs delineate several sedimentary basins such as the Aquitaine basin in the southwest and the Paris basin in the north, the latter including several areas of particularly fertile ground such as the silt beds of Beauce and Brie. Various routes of natural passage, such as the Rh\u00f4ne Valley, allow easy communication. The Alpine, Pyrenean and Jura mountains are much younger and have less eroded forms. At 4,810.45 metres (15,782\u00a0ft)[89] above sea level, Mont Blanc, located in the Alps on the French and Italian border, is the highest point in Western Europe. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Internet TLD | .fr[XI] |\n| Source gives area of metropolitan France as 551,500 km2 (212,900 sq mi) and lists overseas regions separately, whose areas sum to 89,179 km2 (34,432 sq mi).

The Rh\u00f4ne divides the Massif Central from the Alps and flows into the Mediterranean Sea at the Camargue. The Garonne meets the Dordogne just after Bordeaux, forming the Gironde estuary, the largest estuary in Western Europe which after approximately 100 kilometres (62\u00a0mi) empties into the Atlantic Ocean.[90] Other water courses drain towards the Meuse and Rhine along the northeastern borders. France has 11\u00a0million square kilometres (4.2\u00d710~~^~~6\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of marine waters within three oceans under its jurisdiction, of which 97% are overseas.\n\n\n\n### Environment[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDue to its numerous overseas departments and territories scattered across the planet, France possesses the second-largest exclusive economic zone (EEZ) in the world, covering 11,035,000\u00a0km2 (4,261,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), just behind the EEZ of the United States, which covers 11,351,000\u00a0km2 (4,383,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), but ahead of the EEZ of Australia, which covers 8,148,250\u00a0km2 (3,146,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). Its EEZ covers approximately 8% of the total surface of all the EEZs of the world.\n\n\n\n### Geology, topography and hydrography[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Places adjacent to France\n |\n| --- |\n| |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\u00a0United Kingdom | ![](image)\u00a0United Kingdom | ![](image)\u00a0Belgium![](image)\u00a0Luxembourg |\n|  | ![](image) |  |\n| Atlantic Ocean | ![](image)**![](image)\u00a0France**![](image)\n | ![](image)\u00a0Germany![](image)\u00a0\u00a0Switzerland![](image)\u00a0Italy |\n|  | ![](image) |  |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Spain![](image)\u00a0Andorra | ![](image)\u00a0Algeria | Mediterranean Sea |\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIts eighteen integral regions (five of which are overseas) span a combined area of 643,801\u00a0km2 (248,573\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) and have a total population of over 68 million as of January\u00a02023[update].[5][8] France is a unitary semi-presidential republic with its capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre; other major urban areas include Marseille, Lyon, Toulouse, Lille, Bordeaux, Strasbourg and Nice.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nsustainable economic development and protection of the natural environment based on each park's unique landscape and heritage.
