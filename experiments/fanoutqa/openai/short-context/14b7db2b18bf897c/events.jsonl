It is somewhat distanced from the line of the Himalayas and, because it is near where the monsoon approaches from the Bay of Bengal, the monsoon season persists longer than for any other of the eight-thousanders.[5]\n\n\nThroughout the 20th century and from even before that time, the mountain had been explored by many teams and the two routes attempted in 1955 – both of them up the Yalung Face of the mountain from the Yalung glacier – had been reconnoitred in 1905 by a Swiss team led by Jules Jacot-Guillarmod with Aleister Crowley as climbing leader[note 1] and by John Kempe in 1954.[note 2] Kempe's report led to the Alpine Club agreeing to sponsor a reconnaissance effort which might also attempt to reach the summit.[7][8]\n\n\nA detailed map of the region was produced by Marcel Kurz [de] in 1931.[9]\n\n\n\n### Team members[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Painting by Edward Lear of Kangchenjunga seen from Darjeeling\nFollowing the ascent of Everest in 1953 and K2 in 1954, Kangchenjunga, the third highest mountain in the world, had become the highest unclimbed mountain.[1] The mountain is on the border between Nepal and Sikkim and can be approached from either side.[2] It is the most widely visible of the 8000-metre peaks and can be well seen from Darjeeling in West Bengal. In 1955 Sikkim had a degree of control over its internal affairs and would not allow any attempt to climb the mountain.[3] However, from 1950 Nepal had been permitting a few mountaineering expeditions, particularly enabling reconnaissance of routes to Everest, and were willing to allow an attempt on Kangchenjunga from the west.[4]\n\n\n\n### Exploration[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Kangchenjunga § Climbing history\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Catterall, Peter, ed.

But in sheer magnitude, in the vastness of its quadruple system of glaciers, in its enormous cliffs, and in its interminable ridges, it is unequalled on the earth’s surface. Moreover, until Evans undertook to solve its problems last year, it seemed as if it might be the one great mountain in the world that could not be climbed.\n> \n> \n\n\nOver fifty years later Doug Scott, who had climbed Mount Everest and Kangchenjunga, wrote it was[5]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n> It would be naive to suppose that they can never change.

A Japanese team attempted to reach the West summit but two died after reaching the summit.[90]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Yalung or Southwest Face of Kanchengjunga\nStreather, Mather and their Sherpas started stocking Camp 4 while the rest of the climbers returned to recuperate at Base Camp. When there, Evans announced the detailed plans for the next few days – the reconnaissance had turned into a bid for the summit. Jackson, McKinnon and their\nSherpas would stock Camp 5. Brown and Band, the first summit pair, supported by Evans, Mather and four Sherpas would follow a day later. The supporting climbers would establish Camp 6 as near to the top of the Gangway as possible. Hardie and Streather would be a second assault team, supported by two Sherpas and moving up a day later still.[61]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn the initial march-in, to avoid high passes that might be snowbound, they had left the Singalila Ridge quite far south at Phulat to head down into the jungle of Nepal. On the return march in heavy rain they went up onto the ridge further north, after Ramser, and followed along the crest to avoid leeches infesting the valleys at the time of the monsoon.[83][20][note 17] On 13 June they were back at Darjeeling[85]\n\n\n\n## Assessment[edit]\n\n\nA day after Norman Hardie and Tony Streather made the second ascent, a coded message was sent back to London announcing their success. The news made headlines around the world, but the expedition never made such an impact as previous ascents such as Everest or K2. In addition, none of the team received national honours at the time. Evans' and Band's publications did not encourage any of the usual nationalist feelings: their reports made no mention of flags placed on the summit.[75][86]\n\n\nIn a 1956 *American Alpine Journal* editorial Francis Farquhar said[87]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Crowley describes the 1905 expedition in The Confessions of Aleister Crowley.[6]\n2. **^** Kempe (1955) describes the 1954 expedition.\n3. **^** Dawa Tensing is not to be confused with Tenzing Norgay who had also been on the 1952 Swiss and 1953 British Everest expeditions.\n4. **^** Sherpas named were: Dawa Tensing, Annullu, Aila, Ang Dawa (from Kunde), Ang Dawa (from Namche Bazaar), Ang Norbu, Ang Temba, Changjup, Da Tsering, Gyalgen, Hlakpa Sonar, Ila Tenzing, Lobsang, Mingma Tenzing, Pasang Sonar, Phurchita, Pemi Dorje, Tashi, Topke, Urkien.[10]\n5. **^** \nDoug Scott wrote: The expedition was brilliantly led by Charles Evans who created a wonderful team effort that put George [Band] and Joe Brown in position to make the first ascent ... to within 10 ft of the summit.

Brown led a final rock climb up a 20-foot (6 m) tall crack with a slight overhang at the top (grade about \"very difficult\" ignoring the altitude [68]).

It was 14:45 on 25 May 1955.[69][70] Even though this was the first ascent of the mountain, as agreed they did not go up onto the summit itself.[71] There was a layer of cloud at 20,000 feet (6,100 m) so they could only see the highest peaks – Makalu,[note 16] Lhotse and Everest, 80 miles (130 km) away to the west.[69]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nYalung Camp was established as a substantial camp from where to acclimatise by climbing many nearby peaks.[21][2] [note 7] Accurate theodolite measurements were taken of features in the vicinity of Kangchenjunga's Yalung, or southwest, face.

The expedition examined ascent routes both north and south of the mountain and made best progress up the north-east ridge before they were forced to abandon their efforts.[8] Since that time K2 has developed the reputation of being a more difficult mountain to climb than Mount Everest – every route to the summit is tough.[9][note 5] K2 is farther north than the Himalayan mountains so the climate is colder; the Karakoram range is wider than the Himalayan so more ice and snow is trapped there.[12]\n\n\nBefore the successful Italian ascent, the expedition that had previously climbed highest on K2 had been the 1939 American Karakoram expedition which reached 8,370 metres (27,450 ft).[13]\n\n\n\n### Previous Italian expeditions in the Baltoro Muztagh Karakoram[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nK2 is on the border between China and what was in 1954 the newly independent Pakistan.

This route later became known as the Abruzzi Ridge (or Abruzzi Spur) and eventually became regarded as the normal route to the summit.[1]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe fact that the summit had been reached was never doubted – Compagnoni and Lacedelli had been seen by their colleagues near the summit and they had taken photographs and even a movie film from the top – but all the same the expedition became mired in argument. The official 1954 account of the expedition eventually became discredited and after a prolonged controversy a second official account was published in 2007 which largely confirmed the claims another member of the expedition, Walter Bonatti, had been making for over fifty years.\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\n### K2[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe sun came out and, with it shining on the snow, the porters were struck with snow blindness.

That Compagnoni and Lacedelli had reached the summit of K2 was not in dispute – at issue was the extent to which they had depended on support from other climbers high on the mountain, how they had treated Bonatti and Madhi, whether they used oxygen all the way to the top, and whether Desio's book was accurate and fair. The matter became increasingly controversial with a great deal of press criticism, often uninformed. Desio died in 2001 at the age of 104 and eventually in 2004 the CAI appointed three experts, called \"*I Tre Saggi*\" (the three wise men), to investigate. They produced a 39-page report in April 2004,[42][note 10] but the CAI delayed until 2007 its publication of *K2 – Una Storia Finita* which included and accepted the *Tre Saggi* report.[44][note 11]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThree earlier unsuccessful American attempts on the mountain had identified a good route to use. Desio felt Italy's earlier exploration of the Karakoram region gave good reason to mount a major expedition which he did on a grand scale, following the American route up the south-east ridge. Progress towards the summit was repeatedly interrupted by storms and one member of the team died rather unexpectedly. Desio considered abandoning the expedition so as to try again by returning later in the year, but then weather conditions improved allowing them to edge closer to the top of the mountain. At last the two lead climbers reached the summit as the sun was about to set and they had to descend in the dark. They and two colleagues went on to suffer from severe frostbite.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThis satisfied the Pakistan government and even the press calmed down.[109] However, it was only very many years later that Bonatti came to believe that in reality Desio regarded the report as a cover-up (one that Desio approved of) for what he believed had been Bonatti's attempt to sabotage the expedition. This was to cause repercussions over the next fifty years.[109][110][111]\n\n\nIt was not until 1977 that the summit of K2 was reached again, by a well equipped, relatively modern Japanese expedition, with fifty-nine climbers and 1500 porters, who again took the Abruzzi ridge.[112]\n\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 1929 Aimone di Savoia-Aosta, the nephew of the Duke of the Abruzzi, led an expedition to explore the upper Baltoro Glacier, near to K2. The geologist on the party was Ardito Desio and he came to feel that there was an Italian claim for attempts on the mountain.[16] It was only in 1939 that Desio could interest Italy's governing body for mountaineering, the *Club Alpino Italiano* (CAI) and then World War II and the Partition of India delayed things further.[17] In 1952 Desio travelled to Pakistan as a preliminary for leading a full expedition in 1953 only to discover that the Americans had already booked the single climbing permit for that year. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Sale, Richard (2011). \"Chapter 4.

George Mallory is quoted as having said he wanted to climb Everest \"Because it's there\", a phrase that has been called \"the most famous three words in mountaineering\".[3][4] Mallory famously disappeared on Everest during the 1924 British Mount Everest expedition and his fate remained a mystery for 75 years.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n25. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Mount Everest Expedition 1953 Archived 4 March 2016 at the Wayback Machine in *Imaging Everest* (Royal Geographical Society, 2001–2003) online\n26. **^** Gill 2017, p. 202.\n27. **^** Hunt 1953, pp. 189–192.\n28. **^** \"Closed circuit oxygen system, high altitude oxygen\".

A New Zealand team including Sir Edmund Hillary was also active in the spring, but did not get very high due to injury and illness.

This was an amazing achievement at the time, to have the vast majority of expedition members summit, especially on such a difficult peak. Prior to this time, summits were reached by one to two expedition members at most, with the rest of teams providing logistical support before turning around and heading home. The French team climbed Makalu by the north face and northeast ridge, via the saddle between Makalu and Kangchungtse (the Makalu-La), establishing the standard route.[4]\n\n\nAn ascent without oxygen was attempted by the 1960-61 Silver Hut expedition but two attempts did not succeed.\n\n\n\n### Notable ascents[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* 2006: On or about January 27 the French mountaineer Jean-Christophe Lafaille disappeared on Makalu while trying to make the first winter ascent.[15]\n* 2009: Makalu was first climbed in winter on February 9, 2009, by Italian Simone Moro and Kazakh Denis Urubko.[16][17] It was the final Nepali eight-thousander to be climbed in winter conditions.
