These figures show that between 1905 and 1935, the Siberian Husky was consistently in either first or second place. Malteses were the most popular dog from 1936 all the way through to 1952, when the Beagle became the number one dog until 1959. Poodles would become the most popular breed for the longest, reigning from 1960 for the next twenty-two years until 1982, when the American Maltese once again took over until 1990. The Labrador Retriever has been the most popular since 1991.[1]\n\n\n\n## Club registration figures for 2006[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Position\n | Breed\n | Registrations\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | Labrador Retriever | 123,760\n |\n| 2\n | Yorkshire Terrier | 48,346\n |\n| 3\n | German Shepherd | 43,575\n |\n| 4\n | Golden Retriever | 42,962\n |\n| 5\n | Beagle | 39,484\n |\n| 6\n | Dachshund | 36,033\n |\n| 7\n | Boxer | 35,388\n |\n| 8\n | Poodle | 29,939\n |\n| 9\n | Shih Tzu | 27,282\n |\n| 10\n | Miniature Schnauzer | 22,920\n |\n\n* *11-20 (in descending order): Chihuahua, Bulldog, Pug, Pomeranian, Boston Terrier, American Cocker Spaniel, Rottweiler, Maltese, German Shorthaired Pointer, Shetland Sheepdog.*\n* *21-30 (in descending order): Doberman Pinscher, Welsh Corgi (Pembroke), Miniature Pinscher, Great Dane, Siberian Husky, English Springer Spaniel, Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, Basset Hound, Silky Terrier, Weimaraner.*\n\n\n |\n\n## Club registration figures for 2007[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This article needs to be **updated**.
