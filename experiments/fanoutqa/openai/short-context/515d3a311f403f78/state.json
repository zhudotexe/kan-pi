Elections and removals are decided by majority vote.[11][*non-primary source needed*] The length of the president's term of office is the same as the NPC, which is 5 years.[11] Since 2018, the president is required to recite the constitutional oath of office before assuming office.[13]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nArticle 84 of the Constitution of China. If the office of president falls vacant, then the vice president succeeds to the office. If both offices fall vacant, then the chairman of the NPC Standing Committee temporarily acts as president until the NPC can elect a new president and vice president.[25]\n\n\n\n## List of state representatives[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of state representatives of the People's Republic of China.\n\n### Timeline[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\n### Chairmen[edit]\n\n\n* ![Mao Zedong (27 September 1954 \u2013 27 April 1959; Chairman of the Central People's Government 1 October 1949 \u2013 27 September 1954)](image)\n\n**Mao Zedong**  \n(27 September 1954 \u2013  \n27 April 1959;  \n*Chairman of the Central People's Government*  \n1 October 1949 \u2013  \n27 September 1954)\n* ![Liu Shaoqi (27 April 1959 \u2013 31 October 1968)](image)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Part of a series on**Orders of succession** |\n| Presidencies |\n| * Argentina\n* Austria\n* Brazil\n* Colombia\n* China\n* DR Congo\n* Finland\n* France\n* Germany\n* India\n* Indonesia\n* Israel\n* Italy\n* Ireland\n* Republic of Korea\n* Mexico\n* Pakistan\n* Peru\n* Philippines\n* Poland\n* Romania\n* Sri Lanka\n* Taiwan\n* United States\n* Uruguay\n* Vietnam\n |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\n## Post title[edit]\n\n\nThe title of the office (Chinese: \u56fd\u5bb6\u4e3b\u5e2d; pinyin: *Gu\u00f3ji\u0101 Zh\u01d4x\u00ed*), which literally translates to \"state chairman\", was unchanged in the Chinese text, but a new English translation of \"President of the People's Republic of China\" has been adopted since 1982, instead of \"Chairman of the People's Republic of China\".[16]\n\n\n\n## Order of succession[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* List of Chinese leaders\n* List of leaders of the People's Republic of China\n* Orders of precedence in China\n* Air transports of heads of state and government\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** In Chinese, the president of the PRC is termed *zh\u01d4x\u00ed*, while the presidents of other countries are termed *z\u01d2ngt\u01d2ng*.

His administration was known for its focus more on technocratic competence than persona.[3] At the end of his tenure after ten years in office, Hu won praise for retiring voluntarily from all positions. He was succeeded by Xi Jinping.

Additionally, Wen Jiabao became the premier. However, Jiang was re-elected to the post of chairman of the Central Military Commission, the top military body, despite Hu taking over as the general secretary.[32] Jiang resigned as CMC chairman in September 2004, his last official post. Following Jiang's stepping-down, Hu had officially taken on the three institutions in the People's Republic of China where power lie; the party, the state, as well as the military.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n\n\n### Power transition of Xi Jinping[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 18th Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party\n\nSee also: 12th National People's Congress\n\nOn 15 November 2012, immediately after the 18th CCP National Congress, Xi was elected to the posts of general secretary of the CCP and chairman of the CMC by the 18th Central Committee, succeeding Hu.[57] On 14 March 2013, he was succeeded by Xi as president.[58]\n\n\n\n## After retirement[edit]\n\n\nSince his retirement, Hu has kept a low-profile, rarely making public appearances. In September 2013, Hu visited an ancestral family home in Huangshan, Anhui, though the trip was not covered by state media.[59] In April 2014, he made an appearance in Hunan, visiting Hunan University and other historical sites.[60] He attended the 19th CCP National Congress in October 2017.[61] He also attended the 70th anniversary of the People's Republic of China in October 2019, and the 100th anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party in July 2021.[62]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n15th Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party (1997\u20132002)\n |\n| --- |\n| Standing Committee | 1.

In 1993, Jiang Zemin, who had been general secretary of the CCP and chairman of the Central Military Commission since 1989, assumed the presidency as well, becoming the undisputed top leader of the party and the state.[6][7] Jiang stepped down as president in 2003, handing the post to then\u2013Vice President Hu Jintao, the first vice president to assume the office. Hu had already become general secretary in 2002. In turn, Hu vacated both offices for Xi Jinping in 2012 and 2013, who had also previously served as vice president under Hu.[8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| President of thePeople's Republic of China |\n| --- |\n| \u4e2d\u534e\u4eba\u6c11\u5171\u548c\u56fd\u4e3b\u5e2d |\n| ![](image)National Emblem of the People's Republic of China\n |\n| ![](image)Flag of the People's Republic of China\n |\n| ![](image)\n**IncumbentXi Jinping**since\u00a014 March 2013\n |\n| Office of the President of thePeople's Republic of China |\n| Style | * Mr President (\u4e3b\u5e2d)(informal)\n* His Excellency (\u9601\u4e0b)(diplomatic)\n |\n| Type | State representative |\n| Status | Ceremonial presidency |\n| Reports to | National People's Congress and its Standing Committee |\n| Residence | West Building, Zhongnanhai |\n| Seat | Beijing |\n| Nominator | Presidium of the National People's Congress |\n| Appointer | National People's Congress |\n| Term length | Five years,renewable with no-limit |\n| Constituting instrument | Constitution of the People's Republic of China |\n| Precursor | Chairman of the Central People's Government (1949\u20131954) |\n| Formation | 27\u00a0September 1954; 69 years ago\u00a0(1954-09-27) |\n| First holder | Mao Zedong |\n| Abolished | 1975\u20131982 |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | 1981052929 May 1981\n | 32,26388 years, 122 days\n |\n| Presidency abolished\n |\n| 3\n | Xiannian, LiLi Xiannian | 1909062323 June 1909(23 June 1909) | 73 36073 years, 360 days\n | 04 2954 years, 295 days\n | 78 29078 years, 290 days\n | 1992062121 June 1992\n | 30,31482 years, 364 days\n |\n| 4\n | Shangkun, YangYang Shangkun | 190708033 August 1907(3 August 1907) | 80 25080 years, 250 days\n | 04 3524 years, 352 days\n | 85 23685 years, 236 days\n | 1998091414 September 1998\n | 33,28091 years, 42 days\n |\n| 5\n | Zemin, JiangJiang Zemin | 1926081717 August 1926(17 August 1926) | 66 22266 years, 222 days\n | 09 3539 years, 353 days\n | 76 21076 years, 210 days\n | 2022113030 November 2022\n | 35,16996 years, 105 days\n |\n| 6\n | Jintao, HuHu Jintao | 1942122121 December 1942(21 December 1942) | 60 08460 years, 84 days\n | 09 3649 years, 365 days\n | 70 08470 years, 84 days\n | Living\n | 29,76081\u00a0years, 175\u00a0days (Living)\n |\n| 7\n | Jinping, XiXi Jinping | 1953061515 June 1953(15 June 1953) | 59 years, 272 days\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nState representative of the People's Republic of China\n |\n| --- |\n| * President\n* Vice President\n |\n| Common Program(1949\u20131954) | CPG Chairman\nMao Zedong\n | ![](image)\n |\n| 1954 Constitution(1954\u20131975) | Chairperson\nMao Zedong\nLiu Shaoqi\n*Song Qingling & Dong Biwu* (co-acting)\n*Dong Biwu* (acting)\n |\n| 1975 & 1978 Constitutions(1975\u20131982) | NPCSC Chairperson\nZhu De\n*Song Qingling* (acting)\nYe Jianying\n |\n| 1982 Constitution(1982\u2013present) | President\nLi Xiannian\nYang Shangkun\nJiang Zemin\nHu Jintao\nXi Jinping\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n18. **^** Yew, Chiew Ping; Gang Chen (2010). *China's National People's Congress 2010: Addressing Challenges With No Breakthrough in Legislative Assertiveness* (PDF).
