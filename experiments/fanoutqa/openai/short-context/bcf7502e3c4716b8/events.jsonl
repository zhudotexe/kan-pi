In the case of others such as the Mackenzie, it is the combined lengths of the main stem and one or more upstream tributaries, as noted. Excluded from the list are rivers such as the Dauphin, a short connecting link between lakes Manitoba and Winnipeg, with main stems of 100 km (62 mi) or less. Also excluded are rivers such as the Mississippi, the main stems of which do not enter Canada even though some of their tributaries do.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLongest rivers of Canada\n| **#** | **Name** | **Mouth** | **Length**[3] | **Source**[n 1] | **Watershedarea**[3] | **Discharge**[3][5] | **Provinces, states** | **Image** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | Mackenzie River | Beaufort Sea69°21′59″N 133°54′10″W﻿ / ﻿69.36639°N 133.90278°W﻿ / 69.36639; -133.90278﻿ (Mackenzie River (mouth))[6] | 4,241 km2,635 mi[n 2] | Thutade Lake56°44′00″N 127°31′00″W﻿ / ﻿56.73333°N 127.51667°W﻿ / 56.73333; -127.51667﻿ (Finlay River (source)) | 1,805,200 km2697,000 mi2 | 9,700 m3/s340,000 ft3/s | Northwest Territories | ![A frozen river passes through flat country.

The dividing line is generally considered to be the Ural Mountains. The European part is drained into the Arctic Ocean, Baltic Sea, Black Sea, and Caspian Sea. The Asian part is drained into the Arctic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean.\n\n\nNotable rivers of Russia in Europe are Volga (which is the longest river in Europe), Pechora, Don, Kama, Oka and the Northern Dvina, while several other rivers originate in Russia but flow into other countries, such as the Dnieper and the Western Dvina.\n\n\nIn Asia, important rivers are the Ob, the Irtysh, the Yenisei, the Angara, the Lena, the Amur, the Yana, the Indigirka, and the Kolyma.\n\n\nIn the list below, the rivers are grouped by the seas or oceans into which they flow. Rivers that flow into other rivers are ordered by the proximity of their point of confluence to the mouth of the main river, i.e., the lower in the list, the more upstream.\n\n\n\nThere is an

The Amazon's length was calculated as 6,992 km (4,345 mi), taking the Apacheta Creek as its source. Using the same techniques, the length of the Nile was calculated as 6,853 km (4,258 mi), which is longer than previous estimates but still shorter than the Amazon. The results were reached by measuring the Amazon downstream to the beginning of the tidal estuary of *Canal do Sul* and then, after a sharp turn back, following tidal canals surrounding the isle of Marajó and finally including the marine waters of the *Río Pará* bay in its entire length.[58][20] According to an earlier article on the webpage of the National Geographic, the Amazon's length was calculated as 6,800 km (4,200 mi) by a Brazilian scientist. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn June 2007, Guido Gelli, director of science at the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), told London's Telegraph Newspaper that it could be considered that the Amazon was the longest river in the world.[64] However, according to the above sources, none of the two results was published, and questions were raised about the researchers' methodology. In 2009, a peer-reviewed article, was published, concluding that the Nile is longer than the Amazon by stating a length of 7,088 km (4,404 mi) for the Nile and 6,575 km (4,086 mi) for the Amazon, measured by using a combination of satellite image analysis and field investigations to the source regions.[3]\nAccording to the Encyclopædia Britannica, the final length of the Amazon remains open to interpretation and continued debate.[2][20]\n\n\n\n## Watershed[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Amazon basin\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. 6,400 km (4,000 mi)[2] (6,275 to 7,025 km (3,899 to 4,365 mi))[3] – Amazon, South America\n2. 3,250 km (2,019 mi) – Madeira, Bolivia/Brazil[108]\n3. 3,211 km (1,995 mi) – Purús, Peru/Brazil[109]\n4. 2,820 km (1,752 mi) – Japurá or Caquetá, Colombia/Brazil[110]\n5. 2,639 km (1,640 mi) – Tocantins, Brazil[111]\n6. 2,627 km (1,632 mi) – Araguaia, Brazil (tributary of Tocantins)[112]\n7. 2,400 km (1,500 mi) – Juruá, Peru/Brazil[113]\n8. 2,250 km (1,400 mi) – Rio Negro, Brazil/Venezuela/Colombia[114]\n9. 1,992 km (1,238 mi) – Tapajós, Brazil[115]\n10. 1,979 km (1,230 mi) – Xingu, Brazil[116]\n11. 1,900 km (1,181 mi) – Ucayali River, Peru[117]\n12. 1,749 km (1,087 mi) – Guaporé, Brazil/Bolivia (tributary of Madeira)[118]\n13. 1,575 km (979 mi) – Içá (Putumayo), Ecuador/Colombia/Peru\n14. 1,415 km (879 mi) – Marañón, Peru\n15. 1,370 km (851 mi) – Teles Pires, Brazil (tributary of Tapajós)\n16. 1,300 km (808 mi) – Iriri, Brazil (tributary of Xingu)\n17. 1,240 km (771 mi) – Juruena, Brazil (tributary of Tapajós)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** The length of the Amazon River is usually said to be \"at least\" 6,400 km (4,000 mi),[2] but reported values lie anywhere between 6,275 and 7,025 km (3,899 and 4,365 mi).[3]\nThe length measurements of many rivers are only approximations and differ from each other because there are many factors that determine the calculated river length, such as the position of the geographical source and the mouth, the scale of measurement, and the length measuring techniques (for details see also List of rivers by length).[3][4]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Amazon River*Rio Amazonas*\n |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)Amazon River\n |\n| ![](image)Amazon River and its drainage basin\n |\n| Native name | *Amazonas* (Portuguese) |\n| Location |\n| Country | Peru, Colombia, Brazil |\n| Cities | Iquitos (Peru);

If only the river's main channel is considered, between the islands of Curuá (state of Amapá) and Jurupari (state of Pará), the width falls to about 15 km (9.3 mi).\n\n\nThe plume generated by the river's discharge covers up to 1.3 million km2 and is responsible for muddy bottoms influencing a wide area of the tropical north Atlantic in terms of salinity, pH, light penetration, and sedimentation.[23]\n\n\n\n### Lack of bridges[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThere are no bridges across the entire width of the river.[63] This is not because the river would be too wide to bridge; for most of its length, engineers could build a bridge across the river easily. For most of its course, the river flows through the Amazon Rainforest, where there are very few roads and cities. Most of the time, the crossing can be done by a ferry. The Manaus Iranduba Bridge linking the cities of Manaus and Iranduba spans the Rio Negro, the second-largest tributary of the Amazon, just before their confluence.\n\n\n\n### Dispute regarding length[edit]\n\n\n![](image)River taxi in Peru\nSee also: Coastline paradox\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWhile debate as to whether the Amazon or the Nile is the world's longest river has gone on for many years, the historic consensus of geographic authorities has been to regard the Amazon as the second longest river in the world, with the Nile being the longest. However, the Amazon has been reported as being anywhere between 6,275 km (3,899 mi) and 6,992 km (4,345 mi) long.[3] It is often said to be \"at least\" 6,575 km (4,086 mi) long.[2] The Nile is reported to be anywhere from 5,499 to 7,088 km (3,417 to 4,404 mi).[3] Often it is said to be \"about\" 6,650 km (4,130 mi) long.[17] There are several factors that can affect these measurements, such as the position of the geographical source and the mouth, the scale of measurement, and the length measuring techniques (for details see also List of rivers by length).[3][4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nObtaining these measurements was difficult given the class IV–V nature of each of these rivers, especially in their lower \"Abyss\" sections. Ultimately, they determined that the most distant point in the Mantaro drainage is nearly 80 km farther upstream compared to Mt. Mismi in the Apurímac drainage, and thus the maximal length of the Amazon river is about 80 km longer than previously thought. Contos continued downstream to the ocean and finished the first complete descent of the Amazon river from its newly identified source (finishing November 2012), a journey repeated by two groups after the news spread.[59]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMajor river in South America\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n111. **^** Infoplease (2012). \"Tocantins\".

The basin area in this stage is only 23,000 square kilometers (8,900 sq mi), a mere 3% of the total, because few tributaries add to the flow in this stage; nearly all rivers to the south drain into the Huai River, whereas those to the north drain into the Hai River. The Huai River Basin, for example, is separated from the Yellow River Basin by the south dike of the Yellow River.[54] The total drop in elevation of the lower reaches is 93.6 m (307 ft), with an average grade of 0.012%.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe middle stream of the Yellow River passes through the Loess Plateau, where substantial erosion takes place. The large amount of mud and sand discharged into the river makes the Yellow River the most sediment-laden river in the world. The highest recorded annual level of silts discharged into the Yellow River is 3.91 billion tons in 1933. The highest silt concentration level was recorded in 1977 at 920 kg/m3 (57.4 lb/ft3). These sediments later deposit in the slower lower reaches of the river, elevating the river bed and creating the famous \"river above ground\". From Hekou to Yumenkou, the river passes through the longest series of continuous valleys on its main course, collectively called the Jinshan Valley. The abundant hydrodynamic resources stored in this section make it the second most suitable area to build hydroelectric power plants. The famous Hukou Waterfall is in the lower part of this valley on the border of Shanxi and Shaanxi.\n\n\n\n### Lower reaches[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n![China](image) Major rivers of China\n |\n| --- |\n| Yangtze system | * Tuotuo\n* Dangqu\n* Chumar\n* Tongtian\n* Jinsha\n* Yalong\n* Baishui\n* Min\n\t+ Dadu\n\t+ Qingyi (Sichuan)\n* Tuo\n* Qi (Chongqing)\n* Jialing\n\t+ Bailong\n\t+ Fu (Sichuan)\n\t+ Qu\n* Wu\n\t+ Qingshui\n* Hanshui\n* Muma\n* Chi\n* Du\n* Bao\n* Qing\n* Chishui\n* Xiang\n\t+ Xiao\n\t+ Lei\n\t+ Qi (Hunan)\n\t+ Mi\n* Zi\n* Yuan\n* Lishui\n* Miluo\n* Gan\n* Fu (Jiangxi)\n* Xin\n* Qingyi (Anhui)\n* Qinhuai\n* Xitiao\n* Huangpu\n\t+ Suzhou Creek\n |\n| Yellow system | * Kariqu\n* Yuegu Zonglie\n* Daxia\n* Tao\n* Huangshui\n\t+ Datong\n* Wuding\n* Fen\n* Wei\n\t+ Jing\n\t+ Luo (Shaanxi)\n* Luo (Henan)\n* Qin\n* Mouwen\n\t+ Dawen\n |\n| Pearl system | * North\n* East\n* West\n* Yujiang\n* Yong\n* Xun\n* Qian\n* Hongshui\n* Nanpan\n* Beipan\n* Rong\n* Li (Guangxi)\n* Gui\n* Liu\n |\n| Heilongjiang system | * Songhua\n* 2nd Songhua\n* Nen\n* Mudan\n* Ussuri\n* Argun\n* Kherlen\n* Woken\n* Huifa\n |\n| Huai system | * Guo\n* Ying\n* Shiguan\n* Quan\n* Hui\n* Hong\n |\n| Hai system | * Chaobai\n* Yongding\n* Hutuo\n* Ziya\n* Daqing\n* Wenyu\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIts average discharge is said to be 2,110 cubic meters per second (32,000 for the Yangtze), with a maximum of 25,000 and minimum of 245. However, since 1972, it often runs dry before it reaches the sea. The low volume is due to increased agricultural irrigation, increased by a factor of five since 1950. Water diverted from the river as of 1999 served 140 million people and irrigated 74,000 km2 (48,572 mi2) of land.[50] The Yellow River delta totals 8,000 square kilometers (3,090 mi2). However, with the decrease in silt reaching the sea, it has been reported to be shrinking slightly each year since 1996 through erosion.[56]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe river has long been critical to the development of northern China, and is regarded by scholars as one cradle of civilization. Flooding of the river has also caused much destruction, including multiple floods that have resulted in the deaths of over one million people. Among the deadliest were the 1332–33 flood during the Yuan dynasty, the 1887 flood during the Qing dynasty which killed anywhere from 900,000 to 2 million people, and a Republic of China era 1931 flood (part of a massive number of floods that year) that killed 1–4 million people.[23]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAccording to the China Exploration and Research Society,[49] the source of the Yellow River is at 34°29′31″N 96°20′25″E﻿ / ﻿34.49194°N 96.34028°E﻿ / 34.49194; 96.34028 in the Bayan Har Mountains near the eastern edge of the Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture.

The boats were needed to bring in the rails, engines and supplies. Captain Joseph Wiggins sailed the Orestes with rail in 1893. However, the sea and river route proved very difficult with several ships lost at sea and on the river. Both the Ob and Yenisey mouths feed into very long inlets, several hundred kilometres in length, which are shallow, ice bound and prone to high winds and thus treacherous for navigation. After the completion of the railway, river traffic reduced only to local service as the Arctic route and long river proved much too indirect a route.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Yenisey |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)The confluence of the rivers Kaa-Khem and Piy-Khem near Kyzyl\n |\n| ![](image)The Yenisey basin, including Lake Baikal\n |\n| Etymology | from either Old Kyrgyz Эне-Сай (*Ene-Sai*, \"mother river\") or Evenki Ионэсси (*Ionəssi*, \"big water\")[1][2] |\n| Native name | Енисей (Russian) |\n| Location |\n| Country | Mongolia, Russia |\n| Region | Tuva, Krasnoyarsk Krai, Khakassia, Irkutsk Oblast, Buryatia, Zabaykalsky Krai |\n| Cities | Kyzyl, Shagonar, Sayanogorsk, Abakan, Divnogorsk, Krasnoyarsk, Yeniseysk, Lesosibirsk, Igarka, Dudinka |\n| Physical characteristics |\n|  |\n| Source | Mungaragiyn-Gol |\n|  • location | ridge Dod-Taygasyn-Noroo, Mongolia |\n|  • coordinates | 50°43′46″N 98°39′49″E﻿ / ﻿50.72944°N 98.66361°E﻿ / 50.72944; 98.66361 |\n|  • elevation | 3,351 m (10,994 ft) |\n|  |\n|  |\n| 2nd source | The most distant source: Yenisey-Angara-Selenga-Ider system |\n|  • location | Khangai Mountains |\n|  • coordinates | 47°54′47″N 97°57′1″E﻿ / ﻿47.91306°N 97.95028°E﻿ / 47.91306; 97.95028 |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Inclined plane at Krasnoyarsk Dam\nRiver steamers first came to the Yenisey River in 1864 and were brought in from Holland and England across the icy Kara Sea.
