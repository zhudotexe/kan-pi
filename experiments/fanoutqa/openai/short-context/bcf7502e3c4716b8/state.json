          "content": "The **Yenisey River** (also spelled Yenisei or Jenisej) is one of the major river systems in the world and the largest river to drain into the Arctic Ocean. Here are some key details about the Yenisey River:\n\n- **Length**: The Yenisey proper, from the confluence of its source rivers Great Yenisey and Little Yenisey at Kyzyl to its mouth in the Kara Sea, is 3,487 km (2,167 mi) long. Including its tributary Selenga, it is 5,075 km (3,153 mi) long.\n- **Drainage Basin**: The river has a drainage basin of approximately 2,580,000 km\u00b2 (1,000,000 sq mi).\n- **Geography**: The Yenisey flows through several Russian federal subjects, including Tuva, Khakassia, and Krasnoyarsk Krai. The city of Krasnoyarsk is situated on the Yenisey.\n- **Tributaries**: Major tributaries include the Angara, Podkamennaya Tunguska, and Nizhnyaya Tunguska.\n- **Depth**: The maximum depth of the Yenisey is 66 meters (217 ft), with an average depth of 14 meters (46 ft).\n- **Discharge**: The average discharge at Igarka, Russia, is approximately 19,499 m\u00b3/s (688,600 cu ft/s).\n\n### Notable Features:\n- **Lake Baikal**: A significant feature of the Upper Yenisey is Lake Baikal, the deepest and oldest lake in the world.\n- **Krasnoyarsk Dam**: A canal inclined plane was built on the river in 1985 at the Krasnoyarsk Dam.\n- **Contamination**: The Yenisey suffers from contamination caused by radioactive discharges from a factory that produced bomb-grade plutonium in the secret city of Krasnoyarsk-26, now known as Zheleznogorsk.\n\n### Historical and Cultural Significance:\n- **Navigation**: River steamers first came to the Yenisey River in 1864. Imperial Russia placed river steamers on the river to improve communication with land-locked Siberia.\n- **Recreation**: The first recreation team to navigate the Yenisey's entire length, including its violent upper tributary in Mongolia, was an Australian-Canadian effort completed in September 2001.\n\n### Ecology:\n- **Flora and Fauna**: The Yenisey valley is home to numerous flora and fauna, including Siberian pine and Siberian larch. The Taimyr herd of tundra reindeer, the largest reindeer herd in the world, migrates to winter grazing ranges along the Yenisey.\n\nThe Yenisey River is a vital waterway in Siberia, playing a significant role in the region's ecology, economy, and history.",

The dividing line is generally considered to be the Ural Mountains. The European part is drained into the Arctic Ocean, Baltic Sea, Black Sea, and Caspian Sea. The Asian part is drained into the Arctic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean.\n\n\nNotable rivers of Russia in Europe are Volga (which is the longest river in Europe), Pechora, Don, Kama, Oka and the Northern Dvina, while several other rivers originate in Russia but flow into other countries, such as the Dnieper and the Western Dvina.\n\n\nIn Asia, important rivers are the Ob, the Irtysh, the Yenisei, the Angara, the Lena, the Amur, the Yana, the Indigirka, and the Kolyma.\n\n\nIn the list below, the rivers are grouped by the seas or oceans into which they flow. Rivers that flow into other rivers are ordered by the proximity of their point of confluence to the mouth of the main river, i.e., the lower in the list, the more upstream.\n\n\n\nThere is an

The boats were needed to bring in the rails, engines and supplies. Captain Joseph Wiggins sailed the Orestes with rail in 1893. However, the sea and river route proved very difficult with several ships lost at sea and on the river. Both the Ob and Yenisey mouths feed into very long inlets, several hundred kilometres in length, which are shallow, ice bound and prone to high winds and thus treacherous for navigation. After the completion of the railway, river traffic reduced only to local service as the Arctic route and long river proved much too indirect a route.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Yenisey |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)The confluence of the rivers Kaa-Khem and Piy-Khem near Kyzyl\n |\n| ![](image)The Yenisey basin, including Lake Baikal\n |\n| Etymology | from either Old Kyrgyz \u042d\u043d\u0435-\u0421\u0430\u0439 (*Ene-Sai*, \"mother river\") or Evenki \u0418\u043e\u043d\u044d\u0441\u0441\u0438 (*Ion\u0259ssi*, \"big water\")[1][2] |\n| Native name | \u0415\u043d\u0438\u0441\u0435\u0439\u00a0(Russian) |\n| Location |\n| Country | Mongolia, Russia |\n| Region | Tuva, Krasnoyarsk Krai, Khakassia, Irkutsk Oblast, Buryatia, Zabaykalsky Krai |\n| Cities | Kyzyl, Shagonar, Sayanogorsk, Abakan, Divnogorsk, Krasnoyarsk, Yeniseysk, Lesosibirsk, Igarka, Dudinka |\n| Physical\u00a0characteristics |\n|  |\n| Source | Mungaragiyn-Gol |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0location | ridge Dod-Taygasyn-Noroo, Mongolia |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0coordinates | 50\u00b043\u203246\u2033N 98\u00b039\u203249\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff50.72944\u00b0N 98.66361\u00b0E\ufeff / 50.72944; 98.66361 |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0elevation | 3,351\u00a0m (10,994\u00a0ft) |\n|  |\n|  |\n| 2nd source | The most distant source: Yenisey-Angara-Selenga-Ider system |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0location | Khangai Mountains |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0coordinates | 47\u00b054\u203247\u2033N 97\u00b057\u20321\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff47.91306\u00b0N 97.95028\u00b0E\ufeff / 47.91306; 97.95028 |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Inclined plane at Krasnoyarsk Dam\nRiver steamers first came to the Yenisey River in 1864 and were brought in from Holland and England across the icy Kara Sea. One was the SS Nikolai. The SS Thames attempted to explore the river, overwintered in 1876, but was damaged in the ice and eventually wrecked in the river. Success came with the steamers Frazer, Express in 1878, and the next year, Moscow hauling supplies in and wheat out. The Dalman reached Yeniseisk in 1881.\n\n\nImperial Russia placed river steamers on the massive river in an attempt to free up communication with land-locked Siberia.

          "content": "The **Yenisey River** (also spelled Yenisei or Jenisej) is one of the major river systems in the world and the largest river to drain into the Arctic Ocean. Here are some key details about the Yenisey River:\n\n- **Length**: The Yenisey proper, from the confluence of its source rivers Great Yenisey and Little Yenisey at Kyzyl to its mouth in the Kara Sea, is 3,487 km (2,167 mi) long. Including its tributary Selenga, it is 5,075 km (3,153 mi) long.\n- **Drainage Basin**: The river has a drainage basin of approximately 2,580,000 km\u00b2 (1,000,000 sq mi).\n- **Geography**: The Yenisey flows through several Russian federal subjects, including Tuva, Khakassia, and Krasnoyarsk Krai. The city of Krasnoyarsk is situated on the Yenisey.\n- **Tributaries**: Major tributaries include the Angara, Podkamennaya Tunguska, and Nizhnyaya Tunguska.\n- **Depth**: The maximum depth of the Yenisey is 66 meters (217 ft), with an average depth of 14 meters (46 ft).\n- **Discharge**: The average discharge at Igarka, Russia, is approximately 19,499 m\u00b3/s (688,600 cu ft/s).\n\n### Notable Features:\n- **Lake Baikal**: A significant feature of the Upper Yenisey is Lake Baikal, the deepest and oldest lake in the world.\n- **Krasnoyarsk Dam**: A canal inclined plane was built on the river in 1985 at the Krasnoyarsk Dam.\n- **Contamination**: The Yenisey suffers from contamination caused by radioactive discharges from a factory that produced bomb-grade plutonium in the secret city of Krasnoyarsk-26, now known as Zheleznogorsk.\n\n### Historical and Cultural Significance:\n- **Navigation**: River steamers first came to the Yenisey River in 1864. Imperial Russia placed river steamers on the river to improve communication with land-locked Siberia.\n- **Recreation**: The first recreation team to navigate the Yenisey's entire length, including its violent upper tributary in Mongolia, was an Australian-Canadian effort completed in September 2001.\n\n### Ecology:\n- **Flora and Fauna**: The Yenisey valley is home to numerous flora and fauna, including Siberian pine and Siberian larch. The Taimyr herd of tundra reindeer, the largest reindeer herd in the world, migrates to winter grazing ranges along the Yenisey.\n\nThe Yenisey River is a vital waterway in Siberia, playing a significant role in the region's ecology, economy, and history.",

However, the official division for the middle reaches of the river run from Hekou in Togtoh County, Inner Mongolia, to Zhengzhou, Henan. The middle reaches are 1,206\u00a0km (749\u00a0mi) long, with a basin area of 344,000 square kilometers (133,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), 45.7% of the total, with a total elevation drop of 890\u00a0m (2,920\u00a0ft), an average drop of 0.074%. There are 30 large tributaries along the middle reaches, and the water flow is increased by 43.5% on this stage. The middle reaches contribute 92% of the river's silts.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe **Yellow River** is the second-longest river in China,[2] after the Yangtze River, and the sixth-longest river system on Earth at the estimated length of 5,464\u00a0km (3,395\u00a0mi).[3] Originating at an elevation above 15,000 feet (4,600 metres)[4] in the Bayan Har Mountains, it empties into the Bohai Sea. The Yellow River's basin is often regarded as the birthplace of ancient Chinese civilization.[5][6]\n\n\nThe yellow sediments were carried downstream from the Loess Plateau.[7] There are frequent devastating floods and course changes produced by the continual elevation of the river bed, sometimes above the level of its surrounding farm fields.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Yellow River |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)The Yellow River in Sanmenxia, Henan\n |\n| ![](image)Map of the Yellow River with approximate borders of its basin.\n |\n| Native name | * \u9ec4\u6cb3\u00a0(Chinese)\n* *Hu\u00e1ng H\u00e9*\u00a0(Chinese)\n |\n| Location |\n| Country | China |\n| Province | Qinghai, Sichuan, Gansu, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Henan, Shandong |\n| Physical\u00a0characteristics |\n|  |\n| Source | Bayan Har Mountains |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0location | Yushu Prefecture, Qinghai |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0coordinates | 34\u00b029\u203231\u2033N 96\u00b020\u203225\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff34.49194\u00b0N 96.34028\u00b0E\ufeff / 34.49194; 96.34028 |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0elevation | 4,800\u00a0m (15,700\u00a0ft) |\n|  |\n| Mouth | Bohai Sea |\n| \u2022\u00a0location\n | Kenli District, Dongying, Shandong |\n| \u2022\u00a0coordinates\n | 37\u00b045\u203247\u2033N 119\u00b009\u203243\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff37.763\u00b0N 119.162\u00b0E\ufeff / 37.763; 119.162 |\n| \u2022\u00a0elevation\n | 0\u00a0m (0\u00a0ft) |\n| Length | 5,464\u00a0km (3,395\u00a0mi) |\n| Basin size | 752,546\u00a0km2 (290,560\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) |\n|  |\n| Discharge |  |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0average | 2,571\u00a0m3/s (90,800\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s) |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0minimum | 1,030\u00a0m3/s (36,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s) |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0maximum | 58,000\u00a0m3/s (2,000,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s) |\n|  |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Near Xunhua, Qinghai.\n![](image)Liujiaxia, Gansu.\nThe upper reaches of the Yellow River constitute a segment starting from its source in the Bayan Har Mountains and ending at Hekou Town (Togtoh County), Inner Mongolia just before it turns sharply to the south. This segment has a total length of 3,472 kilometers (2,157\u00a0mi) and total basin area of 386,000 square kilometers (149,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), 51.4% of the total basin area. Along this length, the elevation of the Yellow River drops 3,496 meters (11,470\u00a0ft), with an average grade of 0.10%.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Zoig\u00ea County, Sichuan.\n![](image)Guide County, Qinghai in the Tibetan Plateau, upstream from the Loess Plateau.\nThe Yellow River basin has an east-west extent of about 1,900 kilometers (1,180\u00a0mi) and a north-south extent of about 1,100\u00a0km (680\u00a0mi). Its total drainage area is about 795,000 square kilometers (307,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the lower reaches, from Zhengzhou, Henan to its mouth, a distance of 786\u00a0km (488\u00a0mi), the river is confined to a levee-lined course as it flows to the northeast across the North China Plain before emptying into the Bohai Sea. The basin area in this stage is only 23,000 square kilometers (8,900\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), a mere 3% of the total, because few tributaries add to the flow in this stage; nearly all rivers to the south drain into the Huai River, whereas those to the north drain into the Hai River. The Huai River Basin, for example, is separated from the Yellow River Basin by the south dike of the Yellow River.[54] The total drop in elevation of the lower reaches is 93.6\u00a0m (307\u00a0ft), with an average grade of 0.012%.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe middle stream of the Yellow River passes through the Loess Plateau, where substantial erosion takes place. The large amount of mud and sand discharged into the river makes the Yellow River the most sediment-laden river in the world. The highest recorded annual level of silts discharged into the Yellow River is 3.91\u00a0billion tons in 1933. The highest silt concentration level was recorded in 1977 at 920\u00a0kg/m3 (57.4\u00a0lb/ft3). These sediments later deposit in the slower lower reaches of the river, elevating the river bed and creating the famous \"river above ground\". From Hekou to Yumenkou, the river passes through the longest series of continuous valleys on its main course, collectively called the Jinshan Valley. The abundant hydrodynamic resources stored in this section make it the second most suitable area to build hydroelectric power plants. The famous Hukou Waterfall is in the lower part of this valley on the border of Shanxi and Shaanxi.\n\n\n\n### Lower reaches[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n![China](image) Major rivers of China\n |\n| --- |\n| Yangtze system | * Tuotuo\n* Dangqu\n* Chumar\n* Tongtian\n* Jinsha\n* Yalong\n* Baishui\n* Min\n\t+ Dadu\n\t+ Qingyi (Sichuan)\n* Tuo\n* Qi (Chongqing)\n* Jialing\n\t+ Bailong\n\t+ Fu (Sichuan)\n\t+ Qu\n* Wu\n\t+ Qingshui\n* Hanshui\n* Muma\n* Chi\n* Du\n* Bao\n* Qing\n* Chishui\n* Xiang\n\t+ Xiao\n\t+ Lei\n\t+ Qi (Hunan)\n\t+ Mi\n* Zi\n* Yuan\n* Lishui\n* Miluo\n* Gan\n* Fu (Jiangxi)\n* Xin\n* Qingyi (Anhui)\n* Qinhuai\n* Xitiao\n* Huangpu\n\t+ Suzhou Creek\n |\n| Yellow system | * Kariqu\n* Yuegu Zonglie\n* Daxia\n* Tao\n* Huangshui\n\t+ Datong\n* Wuding\n* Fen\n* Wei\n\t+ Jing\n\t+ Luo (Shaanxi)\n* Luo (Henan)\n* Qin\n* Mouwen\n\t+ Dawen\n |\n| Pearl system | * North\n* East\n* West\n* Yujiang\n* Yong\n* Xun\n* Qian\n* Hongshui\n* Nanpan\n* Beipan\n* Rong\n* Li (Guangxi)\n* Gui\n* Liu\n |\n| Heilongjiang system | * Songhua\n* 2nd Songhua\n* Nen\n* Mudan\n* Ussuri\n* Argun\n* Kherlen\n* Woken\n* Huifa\n |\n| Huai system | * Guo\n* Ying\n* Shiguan\n* Quan\n* Hui\n* Hong\n |\n| Hai system | * Chaobai\n* Yongding\n* Hutuo\n* Ziya\n* Daqing\n* Wenyu\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIts average discharge is said to be 2,110 cubic meters per second (32,000 for the Yangtze), with a maximum of 25,000 and minimum of 245. However, since 1972, it often runs dry before it reaches the sea. The low volume is due to increased agricultural irrigation, increased by a factor of five since 1950. Water diverted from the river as of 1999 served 140 million people and irrigated 74,000\u00a0km2 (48,572\u00a0mi2) of land.[50] The Yellow River delta totals 8,000 square kilometers (3,090\u00a0mi2). However, with the decrease in silt reaching the sea, it has been reported to be shrinking slightly each year since 1996 through erosion.[56]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe river has long been critical to the development of northern China, and is regarded by scholars as one cradle of civilization. Flooding of the river has also caused much destruction, including multiple floods that have resulted in the deaths of over one million people. Among the deadliest were the 1332\u201333 flood during the Yuan dynasty, the 1887 flood during the Qing dynasty which killed anywhere from 900,000 to 2 million people, and a Republic of China era 1931 flood (part of a massive number of floods that year) that killed 1\u20134 million people.[23]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAccording to the China Exploration and Research Society,[49] the source of the Yellow River is at 34\u00b029\u203231\u2033N 96\u00b020\u203225\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff34.49194\u00b0N 96.34028\u00b0E\ufeff / 34.49194; 96.34028 in the Bayan Har Mountains near the eastern edge of the Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture. The source tributaries drain into Gyaring Lake and Ngoring Lake on the western edge of Golog Prefecture high in the Bayan Har Mountains of Qinghai. In the Zoige Basin along the boundary with Gansu, the Yellow River loops northwest and then northeast before turning south, creating the \"Ordos Loop\", and then flows generally eastward across the North China Plain to the Gulf of Bohai, draining a basin of 752,443 square kilometers (290,520\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) which nourishes 140 million people with drinking water and irrigation.[50]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

The largest of these lakes is Dongting Lake, which is located on the border of Hunan and Hubei provinces, and is the outlet for most of the rivers in Hunan. At Wuhan, it receives its biggest tributary, the Han River, bringing water from its northern basin as far as Shaanxi.\n\n\nAt the northern tip of Jiangxi province, Lake Poyang, the biggest freshwater lake in China, merges into the river. The river then runs through Anhui and Jiangsu, receiving more water from innumerable smaller lakes and rivers, and finally reaches the East China Sea at Shanghai.\n\n\nFour of China's five main freshwater lakes contribute their waters to the Yangtze River. Traditionally, the upstream part of the Yangtze River refers to the section from Yibin to Yichang; the middle part refers to the section from Yichang to Hukou County, where Lake Poyang meets the river; the downstream part is from Hukou to Shanghai.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica: Yangtze River http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9110538/Yangtze-River Archived August 21, 2008, at the Wayback Machine\n2. **^** Zhang Zengxin; Tao Hui; Zhang Qiang; Zhang Jinchi; Forher, Nicola; H\u00f6rmann, Georg (2009). \"Moisture budget variations in the Yangtze River Basin, China, and possible associations with large-scale circulation\". *Stochastic Environmental Research and Risk Assessment*. **24** (5): 579\u2013589. doi:10.1007/s00477-009-0338-7.

The Amazon's length was calculated as 6,992\u00a0km (4,345\u00a0mi), taking the Apacheta Creek as its source. Using the same techniques, the length of the Nile was calculated as 6,853\u00a0km (4,258\u00a0mi), which is longer than previous estimates but still shorter than the Amazon. The results were reached by measuring the Amazon downstream to the beginning of the tidal estuary of *Canal do Sul* and then, after a sharp turn back, following tidal canals surrounding the isle of Maraj\u00f3 and finally including the marine waters of the *R\u00edo Par\u00e1* bay in its entire length.[58][20] According to an earlier article on the webpage of the National Geographic, the Amazon's length was calculated as 6,800\u00a0km (4,200\u00a0mi) by a Brazilian scientist. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn June 2007, Guido Gelli, director of science at the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), told London's Telegraph Newspaper that it could be considered that the Amazon was the longest river in the world.[64] However, according to the above sources, none of the two results was published, and questions were raised about the researchers' methodology. In 2009, a peer-reviewed article, was published, concluding that the Nile is longer than the Amazon by stating a length of 7,088\u00a0km (4,404\u00a0mi) for the Nile and 6,575\u00a0km (4,086\u00a0mi) for the Amazon, measured by using a combination of satellite image analysis and field investigations to the source regions.[3]\nAccording to the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, the final length of the Amazon remains open to interpretation and continued debate.[2][20]\n\n\n\n## Watershed[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Amazon basin\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. 6,400\u00a0km (4,000\u00a0mi)[2] (6,275 to 7,025\u00a0km (3,899 to 4,365\u00a0mi))[3] \u2013 Amazon, South America\n2. 3,250\u00a0km (2,019\u00a0mi) \u2013 Madeira, Bolivia/Brazil[108]\n3. 3,211\u00a0km (1,995\u00a0mi) \u2013 Pur\u00fas, Peru/Brazil[109]\n4. 2,820\u00a0km (1,752\u00a0mi) \u2013 Japur\u00e1 or Caquet\u00e1, Colombia/Brazil[110]\n5. 2,639\u00a0km (1,640\u00a0mi) \u2013 Tocantins, Brazil[111]\n6. 2,627\u00a0km (1,632\u00a0mi) \u2013 Araguaia, Brazil (tributary of Tocantins)[112]\n7. 2,400\u00a0km (1,500\u00a0mi) \u2013 Juru\u00e1, Peru/Brazil[113]\n8. 2,250\u00a0km (1,400\u00a0mi) \u2013 Rio Negro, Brazil/Venezuela/Colombia[114]\n9. 1,992\u00a0km (1,238\u00a0mi) \u2013 Tapaj\u00f3s, Brazil[115]\n10. 1,979\u00a0km (1,230\u00a0mi) \u2013 Xingu, Brazil[116]\n11. 1,900\u00a0km (1,181\u00a0mi) \u2013 Ucayali River, Peru[117]\n12. 1,749\u00a0km (1,087\u00a0mi) \u2013 Guapor\u00e9, Brazil/Bolivia (tributary of Madeira)[118]\n13. 1,575\u00a0km (979\u00a0mi) \u2013 I\u00e7\u00e1 (Putumayo), Ecuador/Colombia/Peru\n14. 1,415\u00a0km (879\u00a0mi) \u2013 Mara\u00f1\u00f3n, Peru\n15. 1,370\u00a0km (851\u00a0mi) \u2013 Teles Pires, Brazil (tributary of Tapaj\u00f3s)\n16. 1,300\u00a0km (808\u00a0mi) \u2013 Iriri, Brazil (tributary of Xingu)\n17. 1,240\u00a0km (771\u00a0mi) \u2013 Juruena, Brazil (tributary of Tapaj\u00f3s)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** The length of the Amazon River is usually said to be \"at least\" 6,400\u00a0km (4,000\u00a0mi),[2] but reported values lie anywhere between 6,275 and 7,025\u00a0km (3,899 and 4,365\u00a0mi).[3]\nThe length measurements of many rivers are only approximations and differ from each other because there are many factors that determine the calculated river length, such as the position of the geographical source and the mouth, the scale of measurement, and the length measuring techniques (for details see also List of rivers by length).[3][4]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Amazon River*Rio Amazonas*\n |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)Amazon River\n |\n| ![](image)Amazon River and its drainage basin\n |\n| Native name | *Amazonas*\u00a0(Portuguese) |\n| Location |\n| Country | Peru, Colombia, Brazil |\n| Cities | Iquitos (Peru);

If only the river's main channel is considered, between the islands of Curu\u00e1 (state of Amap\u00e1) and Jurupari (state of Par\u00e1), the width falls to about 15\u00a0km (9.3\u00a0mi).\n\n\nThe plume generated by the river's discharge covers up to 1.3 million km2 and is responsible for muddy bottoms influencing a wide area of the tropical north Atlantic in terms of salinity, pH, light penetration, and sedimentation.[23]\n\n\n\n### Lack of bridges[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThere are no bridges across the entire width of the river.[63] This is not because the river would be too wide to bridge; for most of its length, engineers could build a bridge across the river easily. For most of its course, the river flows through the Amazon Rainforest, where there are very few roads and cities. Most of the time, the crossing can be done by a ferry. The Manaus Iranduba Bridge linking the cities of Manaus and Iranduba spans the Rio Negro, the second-largest tributary of the Amazon, just before their confluence.\n\n\n\n### Dispute regarding length[edit]\n\n\n![](image)River taxi in Peru\nSee also: Coastline paradox\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWhile debate as to whether the Amazon or the Nile is the world's longest river has gone on for many years, the historic consensus of geographic authorities has been to regard the Amazon as the second longest river in the world, with the Nile being the longest. However, the Amazon has been reported as being anywhere between 6,275\u00a0km (3,899\u00a0mi) and 6,992\u00a0km (4,345\u00a0mi) long.[3] It is often said to be \"at least\" 6,575\u00a0km (4,086\u00a0mi) long.[2] The Nile is reported to be anywhere from 5,499 to 7,088\u00a0km (3,417 to 4,404\u00a0mi).[3] Often it is said to be \"about\" 6,650\u00a0km (4,130\u00a0mi) long.[17] There are several factors that can affect these measurements, such as the position of the geographical source and the mouth, the scale of measurement, and the length measuring techniques (for details see also List of rivers by length).[3][4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nObtaining these measurements was difficult given the class IV\u2013V nature of each of these rivers, especially in their lower \"Abyss\" sections. Ultimately, they determined that the most distant point in the Mantaro drainage is nearly 80\u00a0km farther upstream compared to Mt. Mismi in the Apur\u00edmac drainage, and thus the maximal length of the Amazon river is about 80\u00a0km longer than previously thought. Contos continued downstream to the ocean and finished the first complete descent of the Amazon river from its newly identified source (finishing November 2012), a journey repeated by two groups after the news spread.[59]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMajor river in South America\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n111. **^** Infoplease (2012). \"Tocantins\".
