It is modeled after the WNBA Commissioner's Cup and in-season multi-stage competitions held in European soccer. The tournament is structured as follows:[36][37][38]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe **2023\u201324 NBA season** is the 78th season of the National Basketball Association (NBA). The regular season began on October 24, 2023, and will end on April 14, 2024.[1] The NBA is currently holding an in-season tournament for the first time from November 3 to December 9, with all games except the final counting toward the regular season standings.[2] The 2024 NBA All-Star Game is scheduled for February 18, 2024, at Gainbridge Fieldhouse in Indianapolis.[3] The play-in tournament is scheduled for April 16\u201319, and the playoffs are set to begin on April 20. The NBA Finals are scheduled to start on June 6, with a possible Game 7 scheduled for June 23.[2]\n\n\n\n\n## Transactions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of 2023\u201324 NBA season transactions\n\n### Retirement[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n39. **^** \"Nuggets' Nikola Jokic, 76ers' Tyrese Maxey named NBA Players of the Week\". *NBA.com*.

The first two rounds of the in-season tournament would then count as regular season games 81 and 82. The championship game would then be an extra 83rd game that would not count toward the regular season. Teams that do not qualify for the in-season tournament, or are eliminated in the quarterfinals, would then be scheduled additional games against each other that are eliminated in the same conference (if possible) and round to reach 82 games.\n\n\nThe schedule for the in-season tournament was released on August 15, 2023.[33] The additional conclusion games for those teams that do not qualify for the in-season tournament, or are eliminated in the quarterfinals, will be announced at a later date.\n\n\n\n### Standings[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n32. **^** \"Mavericks, Real Madrid to play preseason game in Madrid\". *NBA.com*.
