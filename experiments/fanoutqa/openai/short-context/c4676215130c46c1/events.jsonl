For example, during a state visit by a foreign head of state, the president typically hosts a State Arrival Ceremony held on the South Lawn, a custom begun by John F. Kennedy in 1961.[111] This is followed by a state dinner given by the president which is held in the State Dining Room later in the evening.[112]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHead of state and head of government of the United States of America\n\n\"POTUS\" redirects here.

The president directs the executive branch of the federal government and is the commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces.\n\n\nThe power of the presidency has grown substantially[11] since the first president, George Washington, took office in 1789.[6] While presidential power has ebbed and flowed over time, the presidency has played an increasingly significant role in American political life since the beginning of the 20th century, carrying over into the 21st century with notable expansions during the presidencies of Franklin D. Roosevelt and George W. Bush.[12][13] In modern times, the president is one of the world's most powerful political figures and the leader of the world's only remaining superpower.[14][15][16][17] As the leader of the nation with the largest economy by nominal GDP, the president possesses significant domestic and international hard and soft power.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **This article is part of a series on the** |\n| Politics of the United States |\n| ![](image) |\n| Federal government\n* **Constitution of the United States**\n\n\n* Law\n* Taxation\n* Policy\n |\n| Legislature\n* **United States Congress**\n\n\n![](image) ![](image)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n* **House of Representatives**\n\n\n* Speaker Mike Johnson (R)\n\n\n* Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R)\n\n\n* Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D)\n\n\n* Congressional districts (list)\n\n\n* Non-voting members\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n* **Senate**\n\n\n* President Kamala Harris (D)\n\n\n* President Pro Tempore Patty Murray (D)\n\n\n* Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D)\n\n\n* Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R)\n |\n| Executive\n* **President of the United States**\n\n\n* Joe Biden (D)\n\n\n* **Vice President of the United States**\n\n\n* Kamala Harris (D)\n\n\n* **United States Attorney General**\n\n\n* Merrick Garland\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n* Cabinet\n* Federal agencies\n* Executive Office\n |\n| Judiciary\n* **Supreme Court of the United States**\n\n\n* Chief Justice John Roberts\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe president is typically considered to be the head of their political party. Since the entire House of Representatives and at least one-third of the Senate is elected simultaneously with the president, candidates from a political party inevitably have their electoral success intertwined with the performance of the party's presidential candidate. The coattail effect, or lack thereof, will also often impact a party's candidates at state and local levels of government as well. However, there are often tensions between a president and others in the party, with presidents who lose significant support from their party's caucus in Congress generally viewed to be weaker and less effective.\n\n\n\n### Global leader[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nUnited States presidential elections\n |\n| --- |\n| Elections by year | * 1788\n* 1792\n* 1796\n* 1800\n* 1804\n* 1808\n* 1812\n* 1816\n* 1820\n* 1824\n* 1828\n* 1832\n* 1836\n* 1840\n* 1844\n* 1848\n* 1852\n* 1856\n* 1860\n* 1864\n* 1868\n* 1872\n* 1876\n* 1880\n* 1884\n* 1888\n* 1892\n* 1896\n* 1900\n* 1904\n* 1908\n* 1912\n* 1916\n* 1920\n* 1924\n* 1928\n* 1932\n* 1936\n* 1940\n* 1944\n* 1948\n* 1952\n* 1956\n* 1960\n* 1964\n* 1968\n* 1972\n* 1976\n* 1980\n* 1984\n* 1988\n* 1992\n* 1996\n* 2000\n* 2004\n* 2008\n* 2012\n* 2016\n* 2020\n* *2024*\n |\n| Elections by state | * Alabama\n* Alaska\n* Arizona\n* Arkansas\n* California\n* Colorado\n* Connecticut\n* Delaware\n* District of Columbia\n* Florida\n* Georgia\n* Hawaii\n* Idaho\n* Illinois\n* Indiana\n* Iowa\n* Kansas\n* Kentucky\n* Louisiana\n* Maine\n* Maryland\n* Massachusetts\n* Michigan\n* Minnesota\n* Mississippi\n* Missouri\n* Montana\n* Nebraska\n* Nevada\n* New Hampshire\n* New Jersey\n* New Mexico\n* New York\n* North Carolina\n* North Dakota\n* Ohio\n* Oklahoma\n* Oregon\n* Pennsylvania\n* Rhode Island\n* South Carolina\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nMemorials to, and namesakes of, presidents of the United States\n |\n| --- |\n| By president | * 1 Washington\n* 2 J.

For that reason, some observers refer to the German political system as a \"chancellor democracy\". Even though the office of chancellor is often considered the most powerful in the German political system and is seen as such within the German public, it is only the third highest office, following the head of state, the President of Germany, and the President of the Bundestag, a position similar to the speaker of the federal parliament.\n\n\nWhichever major party (CDU/CSU or SPD) does not hold the chancellorship usually calls its leading candidate for the federal election \"chancellor-candidate\" (*Kanzlerkandidat*). The federal government (*Bundesregierung*) consists of the chancellor and cabinet ministers.\n\n\n\n### Role[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFurther information: List of chancellors of Germany § Federal Republic of Germany (1949–present)\n\n**Political party:**\n  CDU\n  SPD\n\n\n\n\n\n| Portrait\n | Name(Birth–Death) | Term of office\n | Political party\n | Vice Chancellor\n | Cabinets\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Term\n | Time in office\n |\n| 1\n | ![](image) | **Konrad Adenauer**(1876–1967) | September 15, 1949–October 16, 1963 | 14 years, 31 days\n | CDU | Franz Blücher (1949–1957)Ludwig Erhard (1957–1963) | I\n\n---\n\nII\n\n---\n\nIII\n\n---\n\nIV |\n| 2\n | ![](image) | **Ludwig Erhard**(1897–1977) | October 16, 1963–December 1, 1966 | 3 years, 46 days\n | CDU[c] | Erich Mende (1963–1966)Hans-Christoph Seebohm (1966) | I\n\n---\n\nII |\n| 3\n | ![](image) | **Kurt Georg Kiesinger**(1904–1988) | December 1, 1966–October 22, 1969 | 2 years, 325 days\n | CDU | Willy Brandt (1966–1969) | I |\n| 4\n | ![](image) | **Willy Brandt**(1913–1992) | October 22, 1969–May 7, 1974 | 4 years, 197 days\n | SPD | Walter Scheel (1969–1974) | I\n\n---\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nII |\n| *Vice Chancellor Walter Scheel served as acting Chancellor from 7 May to 16 May 1974.* |\n| 5\n | ![](image) | **Helmut Schmidt**(1918–2015) | May 16, 1974–October 1, 1982 | 8 years, 138 days\n | SPD | Hans-Dietrich Genscher (1974–1982)Egon Franke (1982) | I\n\n---\n\nII\n\n---\n\nIII |\n| 6\n | ![](image) | **Helmut Kohl**(1930–2017) | October 1, 1982–October 27, 1998 | 16 years, 26 days\n | CDU | Hans-Dietrich Genscher (1982–1992)\n\n---\n\nJürgen Möllemann (1992–1993)\n\n---\n\nKlaus Kinkel (1993–1998) | I\n\n---\n\nII\n\n---\n\nIII\n\n---\n\nIV\n\n---\n\nV |\n| 7\n | ![](image) | **Gerhard Schröder**(b. 1944) | October 27, 1998–November 22, 2005 | 7 years, 26 days\n | SPD | Joschka Fischer (1998–2005) | I\n\n---\n\nII |\n| 8\n | ![](image) | **Angela Merkel**(b. 1954) | November 22, 2005–December 8, 2021 | 16 years, 16 days\n | CDU | Franz Müntefering (2005–2007)Frank-Walter Steinmeier (2007–2009)Guido Westerwelle (2009–2011)Philipp Rösler (2011–2013)Sigmar Gabriel (2013–2018)Olaf Scholz (2018–2021) | I\n\n---\n\nII\n\n---\n\nIII\n\n---\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIf no chancellor has been elected within this period, the Bundestag will hold one last ballot on the 15th day after the first ballot, to which (like in the 2nd voting phase) the parliamentary groups may put forward candidates (\"3rd voting phase\"). A candidate reaching the \"chancellor majority\" in any voting phase, must be appointed by the President of Germany. However, if on the last ballot no candidate reaches this threshold, the president is free to either appoint as chancellor the candidate who received a plurality of votes here (*de facto* allowing formation of a minority government) or call new elections for the *Bundestag* within 60 days.[9]\n\n\nAnother possibility to vote a new chancellor into office is the constructive vote of no confidence, which allows the Bundestag to replace a sitting chancellor, if it elects a new chancellor with the \"chancellor-majority\" (see below).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** German: *Bundeskanzler(in) der Bundesrepublik Deutschland*; often shortened to *Bundeskanzler*/*Bundeskanzlerin*, pronounced [ˈbʊndəsˌkant͡slɐ] ⓘ/[ˈbʊndəsˌkant͡sləʁɪn] ⓘ\n2. **^** In peacetime, the commander in chief of the German Armed Forces is the Federal Minister of Defence according to Article 65a of the German Basic Law.\n3. **^** It is unclear whether and from when Erhard was formally a member of the CDU; however, he was a member of the CDU/CSU group in the German Bundestag throughout his chancellorship and was chairman of the CDU from 23 March 1966 – 23 May 1967, which implies membership at least during this period.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn order to garner legislative support in the *Bundestag*, the chancellor can also ask for a motion of confidence (*Vertrauensfrage*, literally \"question of trust\"), either combined with a legislative proposal or as a standalone vote. If such a vote fails, the chancellor may ask the president for the dissolution of the *Bundestag*; he or she is however not bound to do so, and the president in turn is not bound to follow this request.\n\n\n\n### Vice chancellor[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Robert Habeck, Vice Chancellor of Germany\nThe chancellor must appoint one of the cabinet ministers as vice chancellor (Article 69.1 Basic Law). The vice chancellor may deputise for the chancellor, if they are absent or unable to perform their duties. Although the chancellor is theoretically free to choose any cabinet minister, in coalition governments the leadership of the second biggest coalition party usually designates one of their ministers for the position, whom the chancellor appoints accordingly.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWhen the Nazis came to power on 30 January 1933, the Weimar Constitution was *de facto* set aside. After the death of President Hindenburg in 1934, Adolf Hitler, the dictatorial party leader and chancellor, took over the powers of the president. The new official title became *Führer und Reichskanzler* (meaning \"Leader and Imperial Chancellor\").\n\n\nThe 1949 constitution gave the chancellor much greater powers than during the Weimar Republic, while strongly diminishing the role of the president. Germany is today often referred to as a \"chancellor democracy\", reflecting the role of the chancellor as the country's chief executive.\n\n\nSince 1867, 33 individuals have served as heads of government of Germany, West Germany, or Northern Germany, nearly all of them with the title of Chancellor.\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_5lApQqmAwiJ5ZhHYoIgeFlZd","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

He has centralised his power and created working groups with himself at the head to subvert government bureaucracy, making himself become the unmistakable central figure of the new administration.[108] Beginning in 2013, the CCP under Xi has created a series of Central Leading Groups: supra-ministerial steering committees, designed to bypass existing institutions when making decisions, and ostensibly make policy-making a more efficient process. The most notable new body is the Central Leading Group for Comprehensively Deepening Reforms. It has broad jurisdiction over economic restructuring and social reforms, and is said to have displaced some of the power previously held by the State Council and its premier.[109]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n151. **^** \"Xi Jinping is no longer any old leader\". *The Economist*. 17 February 2018.

The prime minister chairs the Cabinet of Japan and has the ability to select and dismiss its ministers of state. The prime minister also serves as the commander-in-chief of the Japan Self Defence Forces[2] and is a sitting member of either house of the National Diet (typically the House of Representatives). The individual is appointed by the emperor of Japan after being nominated by the National Diet (the parliament). The prime minister must retain the confidence of the House of Representatives to remain in office.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nUnder this system, the *Daijō-daijin* (太政大臣, Chancellor of the Realm)[6] was the head of the *Daijō-kan* (Department of State), the highest organ of Japan's pre-modern Imperial government during the Heian period and until briefly under the Meiji Constitution with the appointment of Sanjō Sanetomi in 1871. The office was replaced in 1885 with the appointment of Itō Hirobumi to the new position of Minister President of State,[7] four years before the enactment of the Meiji Constitution, which mentions neither the Cabinet nor the position of Prime Minister explicitly.[8][9] It took its current form with the adoption of the Constitution of Japan in 1947.\n\n\nTo date, 64 people have served this position. The longest serving prime minister to date is Shinzo Abe, who served as prime minister in two terms: from 26 September 2006 until 26 September 2007, and from 26 December 2012 until 16 September 2020.[10]\n\n\n\n## Appointment[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Shōwa era, 1947–89 | * Katayama\n* Ashida\n* Yoshida\n* I.

Fumio Kishida is the current prime minister of Japan, replacing Yoshihide Suga on 4 October 2021.[3] As of 14 June 2024, there have been 64 individual prime ministers serving 101 terms of office.\n\n\n\n\n## Designation[edit]\n\n\n### Abbreviations[edit]\n\n\nIn Japanese, due to the special nature of the work of the head of government, the prime minister's titles vary depending on context, sometimes demonstrating his/her role. Since the inception of the cabinet system, the prime minister is known in Japanese as *Naikaku Sōri-Daijin* (内閣総理大臣) whenever he is referred to as the head of the Cabinet. However, this title is usually abbreviated to *Sōri-Daijin* (総理大臣). Other abbreviations include *Sōri* (総理), *Shushō* (首相) or even *Saishō* (宰相).[4]\n\n\n\n### English notation[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Presides over meetings of the Cabinet.[21]\n* Commander-in-chief of the Japan Self-Defense Forces.[22]\n* May override a court injunction against an administrative act upon showing of cause.[23]\n\n\nUnlike most of his counterparts in constitutional monarchies, the prime minister is both *de jure* and *de facto* chief executive. In most other constitutional monarchies, the monarch is nominal chief executive, while being bound by convention to act on the advice of the cabinet. In contrast, the Constitution of Japan explicitly vests executive power in the Cabinet, of which the prime minister is the leader. His countersignature is required for all laws and Cabinet orders. While most ministers in parliamentary democracies have some freedom of action within the bounds of cabinet collective responsibility, the Japanese Cabinet is effectively an extension of the prime minister's authority.\n\n\n\n## Insignia[edit]\n\n\n* ![Standard of the Prime Minister](image)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n27. **^** Conferment of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to Juichii (Junior First Rank) and conferment of the Order of the Chrysanthemum and the Grand Cordon of the Chrysanthemum [Regarding the awarding of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to the first rank and the awarding of the Collar of the Supreme Order of the Chrysanthemum and Grand Cordon of the Supreme Order of the Chrysanthemum]. *kantei.go.jp* (Press release).

Titles were usually bestowed in the ranks of count, viscount or baron, depending on the relative accomplishments and status of the prime minister. The two highest ranks, marquess and prince, were only bestowed upon highly distinguished statesmen, and were not granted to a prime minister after 1928. The last prime minister who was a peer was Baron Kijūrō Shidehara, who served as Prime Minister from October 1945 to May 1946. The peerage was abolished when the Constitution of Japan came into effect in May 1947.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* **Justices of the Supreme Court**\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n* Intellectual Property High Court\n |\n| Bank of Japan\n* **Governor**\n\n\nKazuo Ueda\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n* Japanese yen\n* Banknotes\n* Coins\n |\n| Elections\n* List of districts of the House of Representatives of Japan\n* List of districts of the House of Councillors of Japan\n* Japanese House of Councillors national proportional representation block\n* Political parties\n\n\n\n\n**Japanese general elections**\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n* 1890\n* 1892\n* 1894 (Mar)\n* 1894 (Sep)\n* 1898 (Mar)\n* 1898 (Aug)\n* 1902\n* 1903\n* 1904\n* 1908\n* 1912\n* 1915\n* 1917\n* 1920\n* 1924\n* 1928\n* 1930\n* 1932\n* 1936\n* 1937\n* 1942\n* 1946\n* 1947\n* 1949\n* 1952\n* 1953\n* 1955\n* 1958\n* 1960\n* 1963\n* 1967\n* 1969\n* 1972\n* 1976\n* 1979\n* 1980\n* 1983\n* 1986\n* 1990\n* 1993\n* 1996\n* 2000\n* 2003\n* 2005\n* 2009\n* 2012\n* 2014\n* 2017\n* 2021\n* *Next*\n\n\n\n**Japanese House of Councillors elections**\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * Anti-monarchism\n* Censorship\n* Crime\n* Demographics\n* Education\n* Etiquette\n* Gambling\n* Health\n* Housing\n\t+ Homelessness\n* Languages\n\t+ Japanese\n* Life expectancy\n* People\n* Pornography\n* Prostitution\n* Religion\n* Sex trafficking\n* Sexual minorities\n* Sexuality\n* Smoking\n* Women\n |\n| Culture | * Aesthetics\n* Anime / Manga\n* Architecture\n* Art\n* Bonsai\n* Cinema\n* Class S (genre)\n* Cuisine (wine)\n* Festivals\n* Flag\n* Folklore\n* Gardens\n* Geisha\n* Games\n* Hikikomori\n* Hanami\n* Henohenomoheji\n* Icons\n* Ikebana\n* Irezumi\n* Kawaii\n* LGBT culture\n* Literature\n* Martial arts\n* Media\n* Music\n* Mythology\n* Names\n* National symbols\n* *No-pan kissa*\n* Onsen / Sentō\n* *Otokonoko*\n* Origami\n* Sport\n* Shinto\n* Tea ceremony\n* Television\n* Theatre\n* Video games\n* Zen\n |\n\n |\n| * ![flag](image) Japan portal\n* ![](image) Category\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n![Japan](image) Prime ministers of Japan (list)\n |\n| --- |\n| Empire of Japan, 1868–1947 | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Meiji era, 1868–1912 | * H.

But there have been three cabinet prime ministers from junior coalition partners (Ashida 1948, Hosokawa 1993, Murayama 1994), a few minority governments (most recently the Hata Cabinet in 1994 and at least numerically the Second Hashimoto Cabinet of 1996 during its first year, but with an extra-cabinet cooperation (閣外協力, *kakugai kyōryoku*) agreement with two parties, sufficient to ensure safe majorities for most government initiatives), and several cabinets with a majority in the House of Representatives, but without legislative majority of their own (most recently the DPJ-led cabinets after the 2010 election; cf. *Nejire Kokkai*/\"twisted Diets\").[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Qualifications[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe prime minister is nominated by both houses of the Diet, before the conduct of any other business. For that purpose, each conducts a ballot under the run-off system. If the two houses choose different individuals, then a joint committee of both houses is appointed to agree on a common nominee. Ultimately, however, if the two houses do not agree within ten days, the decision of the House of Representatives is deemed to be that of the Diet. Therefore, the House of Representatives can theoretically ensure the appointment of any prime minister it wants.[11] The nominee is then presented with his or her commission, and formally appointed to office by the emperor.[12]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_pXeaxCMO0ruOWPJHmzNH4N8c","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
