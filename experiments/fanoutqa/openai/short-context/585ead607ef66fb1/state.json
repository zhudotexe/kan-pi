The remaining four \u2015 John Gielgud, Audrey Hepburn, Andrew Lloyd Webber, and Tim Rice \u2015 were British. Many countries hold their own equivalent awards ceremonies honouring their own television, music, film, and theatre industries. In some cases, commentators in other countries have derived their own acronyms for individuals who have won at all four ceremonies.\n\n\n\n### Canada[edit]\n\n\nIn 2018, Leah Collins of CBC Arts proposed a Canadian equivalent of the EGOT: the Canadian Screen Awards (and their predecessors, the Gemini and Genie Awards) for film and television, the Juno Awards for music, and the Dora Mavor Moore Awards for theatre.[40] Toronto-based game show Trivia Club referred to this combination as the \"Two-Can-Ju-Do\".[41] No individual has won in all four categories.\n\n\n\n### Australia[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n17. **^** Brandle, Lars (March 5, 2018). \"Oscars 2018: Robert Lopez Is The First Double EGOT Winner\". *Billboard*.

He drew a distinction between the producers who actually do the work of organizing the production of a show and investing producers who merely help finance it, often late in the award season.[9]\n\n\n\n## EGOT winners[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n41. **^** \"Trivia Club: What is the Canadian EGOT, and Why is it the Two-Can-Ju-Do?\".
