In the case of jersey numbers, they are usually no longer available for future players to wear, although they can ask for permission from players whose jerseys are retired. Teams usually display these numbers by hanging banners on the rafters inside their home arena. As of 2022, only two teams in the NBA do not have any retired numbers: the Los Angeles Clippers and the Toronto Raptors. Two players have had their numbers retired by teams they did not play for, and only one player (Bill Russell) had his number retired league wide.\n\n\n\n\n## List[edit]\n\n\n**Key:**\n\n\n\n † \nInducted to the Basketball Hall of Fame\n ‡ \nNumber retired league-wide\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Moses Malone has his no. 24 retired by the Rockets, while his no. 2 is retired by the 76ers.\n* Earl Monroe had his no. 15 retired by the Knicks, and his no. 10 by the Wizards.\n* Dikembe Mutombo had his no. 55 retired by both the Nuggets and Hawks.\n* Shaquille O'Neal had his no. 34 retired by the Lakers, and his no. 32 by the Heat.\n* Oscar Robertson had his no. 14 retired by the Kings, and his no. 1 by the Bucks.\n* Bill Russell had his no. 6 retired league-wide, the first and thus far only NBA player to receive the honor.\n* Jerry Sloan had his no. 4 retired by the Bulls, and no. 1,223 by the Jazz, signifying his total victories as their coach.\n* Nate Thurmond had his no. 42 retired by both the Warriors and Cavaliers.\n* Lenny Wilkens had his no. 19 retired by the Sonics, and his name appears in the Cavaliers' Wall of Honor.\n\n\n## Retired in honor of multiple players[edit]\n\n\nThe following numbers have been retired in honor of multiple players:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 32 | Shaquille O'Neal†\n | Miami Heat | C | 2004–2008 |  | [28] |\n| 33 | Alonzo Mourning†\n | Miami Heat | C | 1995–20032005–2008 | Did not play in 2002–03 season due to injury.
