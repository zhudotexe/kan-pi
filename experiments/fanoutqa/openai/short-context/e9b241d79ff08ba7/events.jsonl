On June 3, 2011, the *Atlanta Business Chronicle* stated examples of *Fortune* including regional headquarters for some cities, excluding regional headquarters for other cities and in some cases excluding headquarters that are physically located inside a city limit.[1]\n\n\n\n## Geographical distribution[edit]\n\n\nSince 2001, there has been significant change in the geographical distribution of the companies in the Global 500 rankings. Most of this growth is accounted for by a rapid increase in the number of Chinese Global 500 companies, of which there were 135 by 2021, increasing from only 10 in 2001. The share of European-based companies also declined, from 158 to 143, over the same period.[2][3][4]\n\n\n\n## *Fortune* Global 500 list of 2023[edit]\n\n\nThe following is the list of top 10 companies in 2023.[5]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs of July 2019[update], this is the list of the top 10 countries with the most Global 500 companies.[10]\n\n\n\n\n\nBreakdown by country\n| Rank\n | Country\n | Companies\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | ![](image) United States | 121\n |\n| 2\n | ![](image) China | 119\n |\n| 3\n | ![](image) Japan | 52\n |\n| 4\n | ![](image) France | 31\n |\n| 5\n | ![](image) Germany | 29\n |\n| 6\n | ![](image) United Kingdom ‡ | 18\n |\n| 7\n | ![](image) South Korea | 16\n |\n| 8\n | ![](image)  Switzerland | 14\n |\n| 9\n | ![](image) Canada | 13\n |\n| 10\n | ![](image) Netherlands ‡ | 12\n |\n\n\n‡ The Global 500 includes Unilever & Royal Dutch Shell under the heading \"Britain/Netherlands\", as the company is counted in the tally for both countries.\n\n\n\n### Leadership by sector[edit]\n\n\nThe following are the top-ranked companies in 2019 for each sector.[10]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAnnual ranking of corporations\n\n\nThe ***Fortune* Global 500**, also known as **Global 500**, is an annual ranking of the top 500 corporations worldwide as measured by revenue. The list is compiled and published annually by *Fortune* magazine.\n\n\n\n\n## Methodology[edit]\n\n\nUntil 1989, it listed only non–United States industrial corporations under the title \"International 500\" while the *Fortune* 500 contained and still contains exclusively United States corporations. In 1990, United States companies were added to compile a truly global list of top industrial corporations as ranked by sales. Since 1995, the list has had its current form, listing also top financial corporations and service providers by revenue.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs can be seen from the table above, 425 (85.0%) of the Global 500 are represented by only 10 countries: two in North America (Canada and United States), five in Western Europe (France, Germany, Netherlands, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom) and three in East Asia (China, Japan and South Korea). Moreover, the top six (United States, China, Japan, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom) are some of the world's largest economies as estimated by the IMF (List of countries by GDP (nominal)).
