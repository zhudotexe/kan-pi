Drysdale, and Donald Dell, and rose to prominence when 81 of its members boycotted the 1973 Wimbledon Championships.[3] Just two months later, in August, the ATP introduced its ranking system intended to objectify tournament entry criteria, which up to that point were controlled by national federations and tournament directors.[4]\n\n\nThe ATP's new ranking system was quickly adopted by men's tennis.[5] While virtually all ATP members were in favor of objectifying event participation, the system's first No. 1, Ilie Năstase, lamented that \"everyone had a number hanging over them\", fostering a more competitive and less collegial atmosphere among the players.[6]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| # | Top 5\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 859 | ![Switzerland](image) Roger Federer\n |\n| 837

For the women's rankings, see WTA rankings.\n\nThe Pepperstone **ATP rankings**[1] are the merit-based method used by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) for determining the qualification for entry as well as the seeding of players in all singles and doubles tournaments.[2] The first rankings for singles were published on 23 August 1973 while the doubles players were ranked for the first time on 1 March 1976. Ranking points are awarded according to the stage of tournament reached, and the prestige of the tournament, with the four Grand Slam tournaments awarding the most points. The rankings are updated every Monday, and points are dropped 52 weeks after being awarded (with the exception of the ATP Finals, from which points are dropped on the Monday following the last ATP Tour event of the following year).

He preferred it over skiing because he wanted to compete directly against an opponent and to have more margin of error over the course of an entire match. He also wanted to be in an individual sport where he could make all of the decisions, an opportunity he would not have in a team sport like football.[10] He decided to move on his own to Bordighera on the Italian Riviera to train at the Piatti Tennis Centre under Riccardo Piatti and Massimo Sartori, a decision which his parents supported.[3][5][7] At the centre, Sinner lived with the family of Luka Cvjetković, one of his coaches.[11] Before Sinner began training in tennis full-time with Piatti, he had been playing only twice a week.[9]\n\n\n\n## Junior career[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n16. **^** \"Sinner Sweeps Into Bergamo Challenger Final\". *Tennis TourTalk*. 23 February 2019.

After winning a national championship in skiing at age eight, Sinner switched his focus to tennis at age thirteen and moved to Bordighera on the Italian Riviera to train with veteran coach Riccardo Piatti. Despite limited success as a junior, Sinner began playing in professional events at age 16 and became one of the few players to win multiple ATP Challenger Tour titles at age 17.

His father, ranked as high as No. 175 in the world, became the top-ranked men's player nationally, while his mother was the fourth highest ranked women's player in the Soviet Union. They both moved from Sochi to the capital to train at the CSKA Moscow military-run tennis club. The Soviet government often restricted their players from competing outside the country, an impediment that limited how high either of Alexander's parents could rise in the world rankings. With the collapse of the Soviet Union imminent, Irina went to Germany to compete at a tournament in 1990, with her husband accompanying as her coach.

It was at this time Zverev, who had been using his nickname Sascha, stated in a postmatch interview with Pam Shriver, that he would no longer be referred to as Sascha. Zverev stated that only his close family can refer to him as Sascha, as he was born in Germany and identifies as a German, and does not want a Russian nickname to be used for his professional career. At the Australian Open, Zverev again pushed Rafael Nadal to the brink, but ultimately lost in five sets.[57] His next ATP tournament was the Open Sud de France, where he won both the singles and doubles events. He and his brother defeated Fabrice Martin and Daniel Nestor for Alexander's first doubles title.[58] The following month, he made his first Masters quarterfinal at the Miami Open, upsetting No. 3 Stan Wawrinka along the way.[59] Nick Kyrgios defeated him at both Masters events that month.[60]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Zverev at the 2014 Bavarian International Tennis Championships\nAs the age of 14, Zverev entered qualifying at three different tournaments, including the 2011 Moselle Open on the ATP Tour, but lost all of his matches.

At the end of the year, he made his first professional final, finishing runner-up to Florian Reynet at an ITF $10K event in Florida.[23] Zverev continued to focus on the juniors in 2013 and did not reach another pro-level final that year,[24] but he did make his main draw debut on the ATP Tour in July, losing to Roberto Bautista Agut at his hometown tournament, the International German Open.[25] He also made his ATP Challenger Tour debut, losing to Máximo González at the Meerbusch Challenger in August.[23]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nZverev's first appearance on grass started with a tournament at home in Halle – he lost in the second round to the eventual tournament winner Ugo Humbert. At Wimbledon, seeded No. 4, he equaled his best achievement at the tournament to date – reaching the fourth round for a second time. Along the way he defeated Tallon Griekspoor, Tennys Sandgren and Taylor Fritz. He was defeated in the fourth round by Félix Auger-Aliassime in five sets.

He threw a big tennis ball into the crowd, announcing the start of the voting and together with one of the show's co-presenters, Željko Joksimović, Djokovic sang Đorđe Marjanović's song \"Beograde\".[649]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDue to his opposition to COVID-19 vaccine, Djokovic was forced to skip many tournaments in 2022,[10] notably the Australian Open and the US Open; two major events he was the favourite to win.[11][12] One year after the Australian visa controversy, Djokovic made a successful comeback to reclaim the 2023 Australian Open trophy,[13] and shortly after he claimed the French Open to take the outright record for most men's singles majors won in history.[14]\n\n\nRepresenting Serbia, Djokovic led the national tennis team to its first Davis Cup title in 2010, and to the inaugural ATP Cup title in 2020. He also won the bronze medal for his country at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. Djokovic is a recipient of the Order of St. Sava, the Order of Karađorđe's Star, and the Order of the Republika Srpska. His other awards include being named the Laureus World Sportsman of the Year four times (2012, 2015, 2016 and 2019) and the 2011 BBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year.[15][16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 9 April 2006, Djokovic clinched a decisive Davis Cup win against Great Britain by defeating Greg Rusedski in four sets in the fourth match of the tie, giving Serbia and Montenegro an insurmountable 3–1 lead in their best-of-five series, thus keeping the country in the Group One Euro/African Zone of Davis Cup. Afterwards, Djokovic briefly considered moving from Serbia to play for Great Britain.[65] The British media spoke of Djokovic's family negotiating with the Lawn Tennis Association about changing his international loyalty by joining British tennis ranks.[65] The 18-year-old Djokovic, who was ranked 64th in the world, initially dismissed the story by saying that the talks were not serious, describing them as \"the British being very kind to us after the Davis Cup.\"[66] However, more than three years later, in October 2009, Djokovic confirmed that the talks between his family and the LTA throughout April and May 2006 were indeed serious:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n585. **^** \"Watch: Novak Djokovic makes fun of Carlos Gomez-Herrera in Monte Carlo\". *www.sportskeeda.com*. 6 April 2023.

He later dropped out to focus on tennis.[13] He then switched to the Russian State University of Physical Education, Sport, Youth, and Tourism, where he received his diploma as coach.[14] With his family he moved to Antibes, France where he trained at the tennis academy.[15] His parents have been living in France since then, as retirees.[12] As a result of living mostly overseas after turning 18, Medvedev can speak French and English fluently, besides his native Russian.[11]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nDaniil Medvedev\n |\n| --- |\n| Entourage | * Gilles Cervara *(coach, 2017-present)*\n |\n| Career | * Statistics\n* World No. 1\n* Russia Davis Cup team\n |\n| Rivalries | * Rivalry with Stefanos Tsitsipas\n* Rivalry with Alexander Zverev\n |\n| Seasons | * 2021\n* 2022\n* 2023\n* 2024\n |\n| Notable matches | * 2022 Australian Open final\n* 2024 Australian Open final\n |\n| Grand Slam titles | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| US Open | * 2021\n |\n\n |\n| Year-end Championships | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ATP Finals | * 2020\n |\n\n |\n| ATP Masters titles | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Miami Open | * 2023\n |\n| Italian Open | * 2023\n |\n| Canadian Open | * 2021(T)\n |\n| Cincinnati Masters | * 2019\n |\n| Shanghai Masters | * 2019\n |\n| Paris Masters | * 2020\n |\n\n |\n| National representation | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Davis Cup | * 2021\n |\n| ATP Cup | * 2021\n |\n| Laver Cup | * 2021\n |\n\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n116. **^** \"Daniil Medvedev Wins Maiden Miami Title, Fourth Trophy of 2023 | ATP Tour | Tennis\".\n117. **^** \"Medvedev Beats Shevchenko in Madrid | ATP Tour | Tennis\".\n118. **^** \"Daniil Medvedev Reaches Rome SFS | ATP Tour | Tennis\".\n119. **^** \"Daniil Medvedev Defeats Holger Rune, Wins Rome Title | ATP Tour | Tennis\".\n120. **^** \"Zverev Tops Medvedev In Cincinnati\".\n121. **^** \"MEDVEDEV THIRD PLAYER TO QUALIFY FOR TURIN\". *Nitto ATP finals*.

Team Europe comfortably won the title, with Medvedev winning his match against Denis Shapovalov in straight sets. At the Indian Wells Masters, Medvedev was upset in the fourth round by Grigor Dimitrov.[81] At the Paris Masters, Medvedev reached the final for the second consecutive year, but lost to Novak Djokovic in three sets.[82] In his third ATP Finals, Medvedev qualified for the semifinals after winning all of his group matches. He there defeated Casper Ruud, but lost in straight sets to Alexander Zverev in the final.[83] Medvedev ended his 2021 season by leading Russia to the Davis Cup title, not dropping a set through his five singles matches.[84]\n\n\n\n### 2022 Australian Open final, world No. 1[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2022 Daniil Medvedev tennis season\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHis six Masters titles all came in different venues, making him only the sixth player to win Masters titles at six different venues.Medvedev made his ATP Tour main draw debut at the singles event of the 2015 Kremlin Cup. In 2017, he participated in a major for the first time at Wimbledon, where he defeated world No. 3 Stan Wawrinka. In 2018, Medvedev won his first ATP Tour singles titles at Sydney and Winston-Salem, and his first ATP 500 title in Tokyo. He achieved a breakthrough in 2019, making his top 10 debut after Wimbledon and reaching six consecutive tournament finals, including at the US Open.[6][7] In February 2022, Medvedev became the first man outside of the Big Three to hold the world No. 1 ranking since Andy Murray, the third Russian man following Yevgeny Kafelnikov in 1999 and Marat Safin in 2000, and the 27th man overall.[8]\n\n\n\n\n## Early and personal life[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMedvedev was disqualified from the second round of the Savannah Challenger event (in Georgia, U.S.) for comments he made after the umpire ruled in favor of his opponent.[27] Medvedev thought he had won a break point against his opponent Donald Young's serve, but chair umpire Sandy French ruled that his returning shot had gone out. After that, Medvedev said Young and French were friends. As both parties are black, he was disqualified mid-match for allegedly 'question[ing] the impartiality of the umpire based on her race'.[28]\n\n\n\n### 2017 First ATP final[edit]\n\n\nIn January 2017, Medvedev reached his first ATP singles final. In the final at the Chennai Open he lost to Roberto Bautista Agut in two sets. As a result, Medvedev jumped 34 positions from 99 to 65 in the ATP rankings, a new career-high. In February, he advanced to the quarterfinals of both the Open Sud de France and the Open 13, losing to Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and Lucas Pouille respectively.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_Ctd96ayOkk8J8Pmvk6zaDVfL","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
