Byzantine emperors Constantine VIII and Basil II, reigning for 66 years in total (962\u20131028) and for 65 years in total (960\u20131025) respectively, are not included, because for part of those periods they reigned only nominally as junior co-emperors alongside senior emperors.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThese monarchs are grouped according to length of reign by year in whole numbers. Within each year-grouping, they appear in historical order. In a given year, there may have been a wide array of actual reign lengths based on days. Thus, this table does not present a precise ranking by length of reign. The list is limited to those that might reasonably be expected to lie within the range of those in the tables above, at minimum 56 years. The list is sorted alphabetically. ***Emphasised*** states were sovereign. Japanese legendary emperors, according to the ancient Japanese calendar, reigned for very long terms of 60\u201370 years each. The longest ruler of the legendary emperors, Emperor K\u014dan, was claimed to have reigned for about 101 years. These figures are not included in the table because they are regarded as inaccurate by modern scholars. For those, see Longevity myths.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n## Monarchs of dependent or constituent states with verifiable reigns by exact date[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

Byzantine emperors Constantine VIII and Basil II, reigning for 66 years in total (962\u20131028) and for 65 years in total (960\u20131025) respectively, are not included, because for part of those periods they reigned only nominally as junior co-emperors alongside senior emperors.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThese monarchs are grouped according to length of reign by year in whole numbers. Within each year-grouping, they appear in historical order. In a given year, there may have been a wide array of actual reign lengths based on days. Thus, this table does not present a precise ranking by length of reign. The list is limited to those that might reasonably be expected to lie within the range of those in the tables above, at minimum 56 years. The list is sorted alphabetically. ***Emphasised*** states were sovereign. Japanese legendary emperors, according to the ancient Japanese calendar, reigned for very long terms of 60\u201370 years each. The longest ruler of the legendary emperors, Emperor K\u014dan, was claimed to have reigned for about 101 years. These figures are not included in the table because they are regarded as inaccurate by modern scholars. For those, see Longevity myths.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n## Monarchs of dependent or constituent states with verifiable reigns by exact date[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

He ascended to the throne shortly after his 18th birthday. Until he was surpassed by Elizabeth II on 9 May 2022, his reign had been the longest precisely documented tenure of any European monarch since antiquity in which a regent (that is, a regent serving in place of an underage sovereign) was never employed.[1] Although his mother acted as his regent from 10 February 1859 to November 1860,[2][3] she was not the regent for a minor, but was appointed by her son to fulfil his duties because he wished to finish his education before he began his rule.\n\n\n\n## Law and reform[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPrince of Liechtenstein\n\n\n\n| Johann II |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)Formal portrait, 1928\n |\n| Prince of Liechtenstein |\n| Reign | 12 November 1858 \u2013 11 February 1929 |\n| Predecessor | Aloys II |\n| Successor | Franz I |\n| Prime Ministers | *See list*\n\n* Karl Freiherr Haus von HausenCarl von In der MaurFriedrich Stellwag von CarionLeopold Freiherr von ImhofMartin RitterPrince Karl Aloys of LiechtensteinJosef PeerJosef OspeltGustav Sch\u00e4dlerJosef Hoop\n |\n|  |\n| Born | (1840-10-05)5 October 1840Eisgrub, Margraviate of Moravia, Austrian Empire |\n| Died | 11 February 1929(1929-02-11) (aged\u00a088)Valtice, First Czechoslovak Republic |\n| Burial | Church of the Nativity of the Virgin Mary, Vranov\n |\n| \n\n| Names |\n| --- |\n| Johann Maria Franz Placidus |\n\n |\n| House | Liechtenstein |\n| Father | Aloys II, Prince of Liechtenstein |\n| Mother | Countess Franziska Kinsky of Wchinitz and Tettau |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Johann II** (Johann Maria Franz Placidus; 5 October 1840 \u2013 11 February 1929), nicknamed **the Good** (German: *Johann II. der Gute*), was Prince of Liechtenstein from 12 November 1858 until his death in 1929.\n\n\nHis reign of 70 years and 91 days is the third-longest of any sovereign monarch in European history, after those of Louis XIV and Elizabeth II respectively, and fourth-longest overall for which exact dates are known (after King Louis, Queen Elizabeth, and King Bhumibol Adulyadej respectively).\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Works by or about Johann II, Prince of Liechtenstein at Internet Archive\n* Princely House of Liechtenstein\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Johann II, Prince of Liechtenstein\n**House of Liechtenstein**\n**Born:** 5 October 1840\u00a0**Died:** 11 February 1929 |\n| Regnal titles\n |\n| Preceded\u00a0byAloys II\n |  **Prince of Liechtenstein** 1858\u20131929\n | Succeeded\u00a0byFranz I\n |\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nMonarchs of Liechtenstein\n |\n| --- |\n| * Karl I\n* Karl Eusebius\n* Hans-Adam I\n* Joseph Wenzel I\n* Anton Florian\n* Joseph Johann Adam\n* Johann Nepomuk Karl\n* Joseph Wenzel I\n* Franz Joseph I\n* Aloys I\n* Johann I Joseph\n* Aloys II\n* Johann II\n* Franz I\n* Franz Joseph II\n* **Hans-Adam II**\n |\n\n| Authority control databases ![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\n |\n| --- |\n| International | * FAST\n* ISNI\n* VIAF\n* WorldCat\n |\n| National | * France\n* BnF data\n* Germany\n* United States\n* Czech Republic\n* Vatican\n |\n| People | * Deutsche Biographie\n |\n| Other | * Historical Dictionary of Switzerland\n* RISM\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n13. **^** \"OLDEST RULER DIES IN LIECHTENSTEIN; Johann II, Who Was 88, Reigned Over Tiny Principality for Seventy Years.

Although considered a prominent patron of the arts and sciences during his long reign,[10] Johann II was also considered to be rather unsociable and did not participate in social events. Rarely did he show up in his magnificent Vienna residences, Liechtenstein City Palace and Liechtenstein Garden Palace. He also never assumed any tasks of the Austrian politics or the Austrian military. And he never married or had any children, like several other members of his family.[11]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
