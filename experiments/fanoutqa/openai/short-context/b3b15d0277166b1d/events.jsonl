In the present more philosophical era it would hardly be allowable to have recourse to the same method and call it Juno, Pallas, Apollo or Minerva, for a name to our new heavenly body. The first consideration of any particular event, or remarkable incident, seems to be its chronology: if in any future age it should be asked, when this last-found Planet was discovered? It would be a very satisfactory answer to say, 'In the reign of King George the Third'.\n> \n> \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nUranus is visible to the naked eye, but it is very dim and was not classified as a planet until 1781, when it was first observed by William Herschel. About seven decades after its discovery, consensus was reached that the planet be named from the Greek god Uranus (Ouranos), one of the Greek primordial deities. As of 2023, it was visited up close only once when in 1986 the *Voyager 2* probe flew by the planet.[23] Though nowadays it can be resolved and observed by telescopes, there is much desire to revisit the planet, as shown by Planetary Science Decadal Survey's decision to make the proposed Uranus Orbiter and Probe mission a top priority in the 2023–2032 survey.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nUranus had been observed on many occasions before its recognition as a planet, but it was generally mistaken for a star. Possibly the earliest known observation was by Hipparchus, who in 128 BC might have recorded it as a star for his star catalogue that was later incorporated into Ptolemy's *Almagest*.[25] The earliest definite sighting was in 1690, when John Flamsteed observed it at least six times, cataloguing it as 34 Tauri. The French astronomer Pierre Charles Le Monnier observed Uranus at least twelve times between 1750 and 1769,[26] including on four consecutive nights.\n\n\nSir William Herschel observed Uranus on 13 March 1781 from the garden of his house at 19 New King Street in Bath, Somerset, England (now the Herschel Museum of Astronomy),[27] and initially reported it (on 26 April 1781) as a comet.[28] With a homemade 6.2-inch reflecting telescope, Herschel \"engaged in a series of observations on the parallax of the fixed stars.\"[29][30]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHerschel's proposed name was not popular outside Britain and Hanover, and alternatives were soon proposed. Astronomer Jérôme Lalande proposed that it be named *Herschel* in honour of its discoverer.[44] Swedish astronomer Erik Prosperin proposed the names Astraea*,* Cybele (now the names of asteroids), and *Neptune*, which would become the name of the next planet to be discovered. The name was supported by other astronomers who liked the idea to commemorate the victories of the British Royal Naval fleet in the course of the American Revolutionary War by calling the new planet even *Neptune George III* or *Neptune Great Britain*, a compromise Lexell suggested as well.[34][45] Daniel Bernoulli, suggested *Hypercronius* and *Transaturnis*. Georg Lichtenberg from Göttingen suggested *Austräa*, a goddess mentioned by Ovid (but who is traditionally associated with Virgo). The name *Minerva* was also proposed.[45]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n> Already in the pre-read at the local Natural History Society on 12th March 1782 treatise, I have the father's name from Saturn, namely Uranos, or as it is usually with the Latin suffix, proposed Uranus, and have since had the pleasure that various astronomers and mathematicians, cited in their writings or letters to me approving this designation. In my view, it is necessary to follow the mythology in this election, which had been borrowed from the ancient name of the other planets; because in the series of previously known, perceived by a strange person or event of modern times name of a planet would very noticeable. Diodorus of Cilicia tells the story of Atlas, an ancient people that inhabited one of the most fertile areas in Africa, and looked at the sea shores of his country as the homeland of the gods. Uranus was her first king, founder of their civilized life and inventor of many useful arts.

In June 1846, upon seeing Le Verrier's first published estimate of the planet's longitude and its similarity to Adams's estimate, Airy persuaded James Challis to search for the planet. Challis vainly scoured the sky throughout August and September.[35][38] Challis had, in fact, observed Neptune a year before the planet's subsequent discoverer, Johann Gottfried Galle, and on two occasions, 4 and 12 August 1845. However, his out-of-date star maps and poor observing techniques meant that he failed to recognise the observations as such until he carried out later analysis. Challis was full of remorse but blamed his neglect on his maps and the fact that he was distracted by his concurrent work on comet observations.[39][35][40]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1821, Alexis Bouvard published astronomical tables of the orbit of Neptune's neighbour Uranus.[34] Subsequent observations revealed substantial deviations from the tables, leading Bouvard to hypothesise that an unknown body was perturbing the orbit through gravitational interaction.[35] In 1843, John Couch Adams began work on the orbit of Uranus using the data he had. He requested extra data from Sir George Airy, the Astronomer Royal, who supplied it in February 1844. Adams continued to work in 1845–1846 and produced several different estimates of a new planet.[36][37]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Galileo Galilei\nSome of the earliest recorded observations ever made through a telescope, Galileo Galilei's drawings on 28 December 1612 and 27 January 1613 contain plotted points that match with what is now known to have been the positions of Neptune on those dates. On both occasions, Galileo seems to have mistaken Neptune for a fixed star when it appeared close—in conjunction—to Jupiter in the night sky.[31] Hence, he is not credited with Neptune's discovery. At his first observation in December 1612, Neptune was almost stationary in the sky because it had just turned retrograde that day. This apparent backward motion is created when Earth's orbit takes it past an outer planet. Because Neptune was only beginning its yearly retrograde cycle, the motion of the planet was far too slight to be detected with Galileo's small telescope.[32] In 2009, a study suggested that Galileo was at least aware that the \"star\" he had observed had moved relative to fixed stars.[33]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNeptune is not visible to the unaided eye and is the only planet in the Solar System found by mathematical predictions rather than by empirical observation. Unexpected changes in the orbit of Uranus led Alexis Bouvard to hypothesise that its orbit was subject to gravitational perturbation by an unknown planet. After Bouvard's death, the position of Neptune was predicted from his observations, independently, by John Couch Adams and Urbain Le Verrier. Neptune was subsequently observed with a telescope on 23 September 1846[1] by Johann Galle within a degree of the position predicted by Le Verrier. Its largest moon, Triton, was discovered shortly thereafter, though none of the planet's remaining 14 known moons were located telescopically until the 20th century. The planet's distance from Earth gives it a very small apparent size, making it challenging to study with Earth-based telescopes. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the wake of the discovery, there was a heated nationalistic rivalry between the French and the British over who deserved credit for the discovery. Eventually, an international consensus emerged that Le Verrier and Adams deserved joint credit. Since 1966, Dennis Rawlins has questioned the credibility of Adams's claim to co-discovery, and the issue was re-evaluated by historians with the return in 1998 of the \"Neptune papers\" (historical documents) to the Royal Observatory, Greenwich.[43][44]\n\n\n\n### Naming[edit]\n\n\nShortly after its discovery, Neptune was referred to simply as \"the planet exterior to Uranus\" or as \"Le Verrier's planet\". The first suggestion for a name came from Galle, who proposed the name *Janus*. In England, Challis put forward the name *Oceanus*.[45]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMain article: Discovery of Neptune\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMeanwhile, Le Verrier sent a letter and urged Berlin Observatory astronomer Galle to search with the observatory's refractor. Heinrich d'Arrest, a student at the observatory, suggested to Galle that they could compare a recently drawn chart of the sky in the region of Le Verrier's predicted location with the current sky to seek the displacement characteristic of a planet, as opposed to a fixed star. On the evening of 23 September 1846, the day Galle received the letter, he discovered Neptune just northeast of Iota Aquarii, 1° from the \"*five degrees east of Delta Capricorn*\" position Le Verrier had predicted it to be,[41][42] about 12° from Adams's prediction, and on the border of Aquarius and Capricornus according to the modern IAU constellation boundaries.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n36. **^** O'Connor, John J.; Robertson, Edmund F.

When Pluto was discovered, it was considered a planet, and Neptune thus became the second-farthest known planet, except for a 20-year period between 1979 and 1999 when Pluto's elliptical orbit brought it closer than Neptune to the Sun, making Neptune the ninth planet from the Sun during this period.[62][63] The increasingly accurate estimations of Pluto's mass from ten times that of Earth's to far less than that of the Moon[64] and the discovery of the Kuiper belt in 1992 led many astronomers to debate whether Pluto should be considered a planet or as part of the Kuiper belt.[65][66] In 2006, the International Astronomical Union defined the word \"planet\" for the first time, reclassifying Pluto as a \"dwarf planet\" and making Neptune once again the outermost-known planet in the Solar System.[67]\n\n\n\n## Physical characteristics[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_oxhK2DT0a3R2Mm7bihBXSFPl","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

Subsequent observations of Neptune in the late 19th century led astronomers to speculate that Uranus's orbit was being disturbed by another planet besides Neptune.[15]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPluto was discovered in 1930 by Clyde W. Tombaugh, the first object in the Kuiper belt. It was immediately hailed as the ninth planet, but it was always the odd object out,[14]: 27 and its planetary status was questioned when it was found to be much smaller than expected. These doubts increased following the discovery of additional objects in the Kuiper belt starting in the 1990s, and particularly the more massive scattered disk object Eris in 2005. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) formally redefined the term *planet* to exclude dwarf planets such as Pluto. Many planetary astronomers, however, continue to consider Pluto and other dwarf planets to be planets.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Discovery[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1906, Percival Lowell—a wealthy Bostonian who had founded Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona, in 1894—started an extensive project in search of a possible ninth planet, which he termed \"Planet X\".[16] By 1909, Lowell and William H. Pickering had suggested several possible celestial coordinates for such a planet.[17] Lowell and his observatory conducted his search, using mathematical calculations made by Elizabeth Williams, until his death in 1916, but to no avail. Unknown to Lowell, his surveys had captured two faint images of Pluto on March 19 and April 7, 1915, but they were not recognized for what they were.[17][18] There are fourteen other known precovery observations, with the earliest made by the Yerkes Observatory on August 20, 1909.[19]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n13. **^** \"Pluto has carbon monoxide in its atmosphere\".

'Minerva' was the Lowell staff's first choice[23] but was rejected because it had already been used for an asteroid; Cronus was disfavored because it was promoted by an unpopular and egocentric astronomer, Thomas Jefferson Jackson See. A vote was taken, and 'Pluto' was the unanimous choice. To make sure the name stuck, and that the planet would not suffer changes in its name as Uranus had, Lowell Observatory proposed the name to the American Astronomical Society and the Royal Astronomical Society; both approved it unanimously.[14]: 136[24] The name was published on May 1, 1930.[25][26]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe resultant expulsion of objects from the proto-Kuiper belt could also explain the Late Heavy Bombardment 600 million years after the Solar System's formation and the origin of the Jupiter trojans.[169] It is possible that Pluto had a near-circular orbit about 33 AU from the Sun before Neptune's migration perturbed it into a resonant capture.[170] The Nice model requires that there were about a thousand Pluto-sized bodies in the original planetesimal disk, which included Triton and Eris.[169]\n\n\n\n## Observation and exploration[edit]\n\n\n### Observation[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCeres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta lost their planet status after the discovery of many other asteroids. Similarly, objects increasingly closer in size to Pluto were discovered in the Kuiper belt region. On July 29, 2005, astronomers at Caltech announced the discovery of a new trans-Neptunian object, Eris, which was substantially more massive than Pluto and the most massive object discovered in the Solar System since Triton in 1846. Its discoverers and the press initially called it the tenth planet, although there was no official consensus at the time on whether to call it a planet.[56] Others in the astronomical community considered the discovery the strongest argument for reclassifying Pluto as a minor planet.[57]\n\n\n\n#### IAU classification[edit]\n\n\nMain article: IAU definition of planet\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_qJwjF3HCOmMWH86KXucpnfct","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

Seven planets were placed in orbit around it in an order of increasing distance from the Earth, as established by the Greek Stoics: the Moon, Mercury, Venus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. This list included two objects, the Sun and the Moon, which are now not generally considered planets.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n*\\* Note: Moons marked by an asterisk (\\*) had complicated discoveries.
