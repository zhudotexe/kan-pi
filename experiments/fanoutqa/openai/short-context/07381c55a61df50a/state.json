This has given rise to a superstition known as the \"*Saturday Night Live* Curse\".[24][25]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe list below includes both repertory and featured players past and present, but omits *SNL* writers and others who were not listed as cast members during the show's credits. The dates given are those of the years they were part of the cast. The chart also shows whether the cast member has served as a guest host, appeared as the anchorperson of the \"Weekend Update\" segment (by any of its titles), or has been the subject of their own \"Best of\" home video collection. Many of the cast members were writers as well. \"Middle group\" performers are introduced after the main cast by the announcer saying \"...with\" and reading off these performers before ending with featured players.\n\n\nSid Caesar has the distinction of being the only person who has been named an honorary cast member. Caesar was presented with a plaque during the goodnights of his hosting stint in 1983. \n\n\n\n### Table[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSeveral former *SNL* cast members have returned to host the show. The first former cast member to come back and host the show was Chevy Chase in February 1978. While the majority of cast members who also hosted the show were first cast members and then hosted after leaving the show, there have been two cast members who have hosted the show prior to joining the cast: Billy Crystal (he hosted the show twice during the ninth season prior to joining the cast in the tenth season) and Michael McKean (he hosted the show in the tenth season and joined the cast in the nineteenth season). McKean is also the only eventual cast member who first appeared as a musical guest (with Spinal Tap, May 1984).\n\n\nEddie Murphy is the only cast member to have hosted the show while still a cast member. He also holds the distinction of having the longest gap between successive hosting of the show. There was a 35 year and 6 day gap between his second and third hosting of the show.\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

After seven years and two failed *Saturday Night Live* auditions, he was spotted in 1995 by an SNL producer while doing a Bill Clinton impression - shortly after Phil Hartman, who had portrayed Clinton, left the show. After an exclusive audition for creator and executive producer Lorne Michaels, Hammond was brought on board as a cast member and performed for 14 seasons.[8] He previously held the record for the longest consecutive tenure of any *SNL* cast member in the show's history, until he was surpassed by Kenan Thompson in 2017.[9]\n\n\nHe also holds *SNL* records for the second most impressions by a single cast member (107, as of the Zac Efron/Yeah Yeah Yeahs episode), beat only by Thompson, and also for the most times saying the show's catchphrase \"Live from New York, it's Saturday Night!\" to start the show (76 times, beating out Dana Carvey).[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nUpon his departure from the cast in 2009, Hammond, at age 53, was the oldest cast member in the show's history. He has made more *SNL* appearances than any other cast member besides Kenan Thompson, and impersonated more than 107 celebrities, with Bill Clinton as his most frequent impression.[2] On September 19, 2014, Hammond was announced as the new announcer of *SNL,* replacing Don Pardo, who had died the month before.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nHammond was born in Melbourne, Florida, the son of Margaret and Max Hammond.[1] He was severely abused by his mother, contributing to his lifelong struggles with depression and substance abuse.[4] Hammond's father, dealing with his own psychological issues resulting from his military service during World War II, often drank heavily and acted out violently. Hammond found as a child that doing impressions was the only thing he did his mother liked.[5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n22. ^ ***a*** ***b*** llarchive.com page for *Loveline* episode: \"2000-05-31, Guest - Darrell Hammond.\"[*dead link*]\n23. ^ ***a*** ***b*** mediafire.com page for *Loveline* episode: \"2004-06-07, Guest - Darrell Hammond.\"\n24. **^** llarchive.com page for *Loveline* episode: \"2004-04-18, Guest: Tim Meadows and Tina Fey.\"[*dead link*]\n\n## External links[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\nWikiquote has quotations related to ***Darrell Hammond***.\n\n* Darrell Hammond at IMDb\n* Darrell Hammond: 12 years on SNL\n\n\n\n\n| Media offices\n |\n| --- |\n| Preceded\u00a0byDon Pardo\n |  ***Saturday Night Live* announcer** 2014\u2013present\n | **Incumbent** |\n\n\n| Authority control databases ![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\n |\n| --- |\n| International | * FAST\n* ISNI\n* VIAF\n* WorldCat\n |\n| National | * France\n* BnF data\n* Germany\n* United States\n |\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

In *SNL'*s first season, the two apprentice writers shared a salary of $350 per week.[13] Franken received 15 Emmy nominations and five Emmy awards for his television writing and producing,[16] while creating such characters as self-help guru Stuart Smalley. Another routine proclaimed the 1980s the *Al Franken Decade*.[17] Franken and Davis wrote the script of the 1986 comedy film *One More Saturday Night,* appearing in it as rock singers in a band called Bad Mouth.

He mocked controversial NBC president Fred Silverman as \"a total unequivocal failure\" and displayed a chart showing the poor ratings of NBC programs. As a result of this sketch, Silverman declined Lorne Michaels's recommendation for Franken to succeed him as the producer, and Franken left the show when Michaels did, at the end of the 1979\u20131980 season.[18] Franken returned to the show in 1985 as a writer and occasional performer. He has acknowledged using cocaine and other illegal drugs while working in television and stated that he stopped after John Belushi died of an overdose.[19][20] In 1995, Franken left the show in protest over losing the role of *Weekend Update* anchor to Norm Macdonald.[21]\n\n\n\n## Post-*SNL* activities[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Fox v.
