He is considered by many to be the preeminent synthetic organic chemist of the twentieth century,[3] having made many key contributions to the subject, especially in the synthesis of complex natural products and the determination of their molecular structure. He also worked closely with Roald Hoffmann on theoretical studies of chemical reactions. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1965.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nWoodward was born in Boston, Massachusetts, on April 10, 1917. He was the son of Margaret Burns (an immigrant from Scotland who claimed to be a descendant of the poet, Robert Burns) and her husband, Arthur Chester Woodward, himself the son of Roxbury apothecary, Harlow Elliot Woodward. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Todd, L.; Cornforth, J.; T., A.

MIT readmitted him in the 1935 fall term, and by 1936 he had received the Bachelor of Science degree. Only one year later, MIT awarded him the doctorate, when his classmates were still graduating with their bachelor's degrees.[6] Woodward's doctoral work involved investigations related to the synthesis of the female sex hormone estrone.[7] MIT required that graduate students have research advisors. Woodward's advisors were James Flack Norris and Avery Adrian Morton,[*citation needed*] although it is not clear whether he actually took any of their advice. After a short postdoctoral stint at the University of Illinois, he took a Junior Fellowship at Harvard University from 1937 to 1938, and remained at Harvard in various capacities for the rest of his life. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Robert Burns Woodward: Architect and Artist in the World of Molecules; Otto Theodor Benfey, Peter J.

He was also a consultant to many companies such as Polaroid, Pfizer, and Merck. Other awards include:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWhile at Harvard, Woodward took on the directorship of the\n**Woodward Research Institute**, based at Basel, Switzerland, in 1963.[15] He also became a trustee of his alma mater, MIT, from 1966 to 1971, and of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel.\n\n\nWoodward died in Cambridge, Massachusetts, from a heart attack in his sleep. At the time, he was working on the synthesis of an antibiotic, erythromycin. A student of his said about him:[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the 1960s, Woodward was named Donner Professor of Science, a title that freed him from teaching formal courses so that he could devote his entire time to research.\n\n\n\n## Research and career[edit]\n\n\n### Early work[edit]\n\n\nThe first major contribution of Woodward's career in the early 1940s was a series of papers describing the application of ultraviolet spectroscopy in the elucidation of the structure of natural products. Woodward collected together a large amount of empirical data, and then devised a series of rules later called the Woodward's rules, which could be applied to finding out the structures of new natural substances, as well as non-natural synthesized molecules. The expedient use of newly developed instrumental techniques was a characteristic Woodward exemplified throughout his career, and it marked a radical change from the extremely tedious and long chemical methods of structural elucidation that had been used until then.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAmerican chemist (1917\u20131979)\n\nFor other people named Robert Woodward, see Robert Woodward (disambiguation).\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n5. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** *Remembering organic chemistry legend Robert Burns Woodward Famed chemist would have been 100 this year* By Bethany Halford C&EN Volume 95 Issue 15 | pp. 28-34 Issue Date: April 10, 2017 link.\n6. ^ ***a*** ***b*** The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1965 - Robert B.

The predictions of these rules, called the \"Woodward\u2013Hoffmann rules\" were verified by many experiments. Hoffmann shared the 1981 Nobel Prize for this work along with Kenichi Fukui, a Japanese chemist who had done similar work using a different approach; Woodward had died in 1979 and Nobel Prizes are not awarded posthumously.\n\n\n\n### Woodward Institute[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n*I owe a lot to R. B. Woodward. He showed me that one could attack difficult problems without a clear idea of their outcome, but with confidence that intelligence and effort would solve them. He showed me the beauty of modern organic chemistry, and the relevance to the field of detailed careful reasoning. He showed me that one does not need to specialize. Woodward made great contributions to the strategy of synthesis, to the deduction of difficult structures, to the invention of new chemistry, and to theoretical aspects as well. He taught his students by example the satisfaction that comes from total immersion in our science. I treasure the memory of my association with this remarkable chemist.*\n### Publications[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFrom a very early age, Woodward was attracted to and engaged in private study of chemistry while he attended a public primary school, and then Quincy High School,[4] in Quincy, Massachusetts. By the time he entered high school, he had already managed to perform most of the experiments in Ludwig Gattermann's then widely used textbook of experimental organic chemistry. In 1928, Woodward contacted the Consul-General of the German consulate in Boston (Baron von Tippelskirch [5]), and through him, managed to obtain copies of a few original papers published in German journals. Later, in his Cope lecture, he recalled how he had been fascinated when, among these papers, he chanced upon Diels and Alder's original communication about the Diels\u2013Alder reaction. Throughout his career, Woodward was to repeatedly and powerfully use and investigate this reaction, both in theoretical and experimental ways. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHis lectures frequently lasted for three or four hours.[5] His longest known lecture defined the unit of time known as the \"Woodward\", after which his other lectures were deemed to be so many \"milli-Woodwards\" long.[23] In many of these, he eschewed the use of slides and drew structures by using multicolored chalk. Typically, to begin a lecture, Woodward would arrive and lay out two large white handkerchiefs on the countertop. Upon one would be four or five colors of chalk (new pieces), neatly sorted by color, in a long row. Upon the other handkerchief would be placed an equally impressive row of cigarettes. The previous cigarette would be used to light the next one. His Thursday seminars at Harvard often lasted well into the night. He had a fixation with blue, and many of his suits, his car, and even his parking space were coloured in blue.[5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWoodward showed that organic synthesis could be made into a rational science, and that synthesis could be aided by well-established principles of reactivity and structure. This synthesis was the first one in a series of exceedingly complicated and elegant syntheses that he would undertake.\n\n\n\n### Later work and its impact[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Woodward talked about Chlorophyll in 1965\nCulminating in the 1930s, the British chemists Christopher Ingold and Robert Robinson among others had investigated the mechanisms of organic reactions, and had come up with empirical rules which could predict reactivity of organic molecules. Woodward was perhaps the first synthetic organic chemist who used these ideas as a predictive framework in synthesis. Woodward's style was the inspiration for the work of hundreds of successive synthetic chemists who synthesized medicinally important and structurally complex natural products.\n\n\n\n### Organic syntheses and Nobel Prize[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWoodward also applied the technique of infrared spectroscopy and chemical degradation to determine the structures of complicated molecules. Notable among these structure determinations were santonic acid, strychnine, magnamycin and terramycin. In each one of these cases, Woodward again showed how rational facts and chemical principles, combined with chemical intuition, could be used to achieve the task.\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Potts. Before Wesleyan was founded, a military academy established by Captain Alden Partridge existed on the land, consisting of the campus's North and South Colleges. As this academy failed, New England Methodists bought it and transformed it into a scholarly institution. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Wesleyan University** (/\u02c8w\u025bsli\u0259n/ \u24d8 *WESS-lee-\u0259n*) is a private liberal arts university in Middletown, Connecticut, United States. Founded in 1831 as a men's college under the Methodist Episcopal Church and with the support of prominent residents of Middletown, the college was the first institution of higher education to be named after John Wesley, the founder of Methodism. It is now a secular institution.\n\n\nThe college accepted female applicants from 1872 to 1909, but did not become fully co-educational until 1970. Before full co-education, Wesleyan alumni and other supporters of women's education established Connecticut College in 1912.[5][6] Alumni of the college include three Truman scholars, three Guggenheim fellows, and seven MacArthur fellows. \n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n215. **^** BEALS, SHAWN R.

By the 19th century, Harvard emerged as the most prominent academic and cultural institution among the Boston elite.[10][11] Following the American Civil War, under President Charles William Eliot's long tenure (1869\u20131909), the college developed multiple affiliated professional schools that transformed the college into a modern research university.

The university's rapid enrollment growth also was a product of both the founding of new graduate academic programs and an expansion of the undergraduate college. Radcliffe College emerged as the female counterpart of Harvard College, becoming one of the most prominent schools for women in the United States. In 1900, Harvard became a founding member of the Association of American Universities.[12]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBetween 1945 and 1960, admissions standardized to open the university to a more diverse group of students; for example, after World War II, special exams were developed so veterans could be considered for admission.[41] No longer drawing mostly from select New England prep schools, the undergraduate college became accessible to striving middle class students from public schools; many more Jews and Catholics were admitted, but still few Blacks, Hispanics, or Asians versus the representation of these groups in the general population.[42] Throughout the latter half of the 20th century, Harvard incrementally became vastly more diverse.[43]\n\n\n\n### 21st century[edit]\n\n\nDrew Gilpin Faust, who was dean of Harvard Radcliffe Institute, became Harvard's first female president on July 1, 2007.[44] In 2018, Faust retired and joined the board of Goldman Sachs.\n\n\nOn July 1, 2018, Lawrence Bacow was appointed Harvard's 29th president.[45] Bacow intends to retire in 2023. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPrivate university in Cambridge, Massachusetts\n\n\"Harvard\" redirects here.

Founded in 1209, the University of Cambridge is the world's third-oldest university in continuous operation. The university's founding followed the arrival of scholars who left the University of Oxford for Cambridge after a dispute with local townspeople.[10][11] The two ancient English universities, although sometimes described as rivals, share many common features and are often jointly referred to as *Oxbridge*. In 1231, 22 years after its founding, the university was recognised with a royal charter granted by King Henry III.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nEnough scholars ultimately took residence in Cambridge to form, along with the many scholars already there, the nucleus for the new university's formation.[16][17][18]\n\n\nBy 1225, a chancellor of the university was appointed, and writs issued by King Henry III in 1231 established that rents in Cambridge were to be set *secundum consuetudinem universitatis*, according to the custom of the university, and established a panel of two masters and two townsmen to determine these. A letter from Pope Gregory IX two years later to the chancellor and the guild of scholars granted the new university *ius non trahi extra*, or the right not to be drawn out, for three years, meaning its members could not be summoned to a court outside of the diocese of Ely.[19]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n19. **^** Zutshi, Patrick (2012). \"The Dispersal of Scholars from Oxford and the Beginnings of a University at Cambridge: A Study of the Sources\". *The English Historical Review*. **127** (528): 1041\u20131062. doi:10.1093/ehr/ces209.

The founding of the University of Cambridge, however, was inspired largely by an incident at the University of Oxford during which three Oxford scholars, as an administration of justice in the death of a local Oxford-area woman, were hanged by town authorities without first consulting ecclesiastical authorities, who traditionally would be inclined to pardon scholars in such cases. But during this time, Oxford's town authorities were in conflict with King John. Fearing more violence from Oxford townsfolk, University of Oxford scholars began leaving Oxford for more hospitable cities, including Paris, Reading, and Cambridge. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter Cambridge was described as a *studium generale* in a letter from Pope Nicholas IV in 1290,[20] and confirmed as such by Pope John XXII's 1318 papal bull,[21] it became common for researchers from other European medieval universities to visit Cambridge to study or give lecture courses.[20]\n\n\n\n### Foundation of the colleges[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Colleges of the University of Cambridge and Oxford and Cambridge Act 1571\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n138. **^** \"Half of universities have fewer than 5% poor white students\". *BBC News*. 14 February 2019.

The colleges within the university were initially endowed fellowships of scholars. There were also institutions without endowments, called hostels, which were gradually absorbed by the colleges over the centuries, and they have left some traces, including the naming of Garret Hostel Lane and Garret Hostel Bridge, a street and bridge in Cambridge.[22]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBetween 1896 and 1902, Downing College sold part of its land to permit the construction of Downing Site, the university's grouping of scientific laboratories for the study of anatomy, genetics, and Earth sciences.[30] During this period, the New Museums Site was erected, including the Cavendish Laboratory, which has since moved to West Cambridge, and other departments for chemistry and medicine.[31]\n\n\nThe University of Cambridge began to award PhD degrees in the first third of the 20th century; the first Cambridge PhD in mathematics was awarded in 1924.[32]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Founded in 1948 as a non-sectarian, coeducational institution sponsored by the Jewish community, Brandeis was established on the site of the former Middlesex University. The university is named after Louis Brandeis, the first Jewish Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n\nThe university has been a member of the Association of American Universities (AAU) since 1985 and has the second-smallest total student count behind the California Institute of Technology in this list. Brandeis is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities \u2013 Very high research activity\"[8] and is accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education.[9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBrandeis decided its undergraduate instruction would not be organized with traditional departments or divisions, and instead it would have four schools, namely the School of General Studies, the School of Social Studies, the School of Humanities, and the School of Science.[44] On October 14, 1948,[42] Brandeis University received its first freshman class of 107 students.[45] They were taught by thirteen instructors[46] in eight buildings on a 100-acre (40-hectare) campus.[47] Students came from 28 states and six foreign countries.[48] The library was formerly a barn, students slept in the former medical school building and two army barracks, and the cafeteria was where the medical school had stored cadavers.[16] Historians Elinor and Robert Slater later called the opening of Brandeis one of the great moments in Jewish history.[49]\n\n\n\n### Early years[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBrandeis' graduate program, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, opened in fall 1954.[65][66] In the same year, Brandeis became fully accredited, joining the New England Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools.[47] As of 1954, Brandeis had 22 buildings and a 192-acre (78-hectare) campus.[47]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n71. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** \"Brandeis University Gets Gift of $1,000,000 for Library\". *The New York Times*.

The first palm tree still stands today in front of the old Technion building, which is now the MadaTech museum, in the Hadar neighborhood. Einstein founded the first Technion Society, and served as its president upon his return to Germany.[18]\n\n\nIn 1924, Arthur Blok became the Technion's first president.[19]\n\n\nIn the early 1950s, under the administration of Yaakov Dori, who had served as the Israel Defense Forces\u2019 first chief of staff, the Technion launched a campaign to recruit Jewish and pro-Israel scientists from abroad to establish research laboratories and teaching departments in the natural and exact sciences.[20]\n\n\n\n## Campuses[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Churchill Auditorium\n![](image)The Obelisk, a 28 meters tall stainless-steel structure, is a kinetic sculpture.\n### Haifa[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Academic rankings |\n| --- |\n| National |\n| *ARWU*[3] | 1 |\n| Global |\n| *ARWU*[4] | 83 |\n| *QS*[5] | 291 |\n| *THE*[6] | 401\u2013500 |\n\n\nThe **Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology** (Hebrew: \u05d4\u05d8\u05db\u05e0\u05d9\u05d5\u05df \u2013 \u05de\u05db\u05d5\u05df \u05d8\u05db\u05e0\u05d5\u05dc\u05d5\u05d2\u05d9 \u05dc\u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc; Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u062a\u062e\u0646\u064a\u0648\u0646 - \u0645\u0639\u0647\u062f \u0625\u0633\u0631\u0627\u0626\u064a\u0644 \u0644\u0644\u062a\u0643\u0646\u0648\u0644\u0648\u062c\u064a\u0627) is a public research university located in Haifa, Israel. Established in 1912 under the dominion of the Ottoman Empire, the Technion is the oldest university in the country.[7] The Technion is ranked as one of the top universities in both Israel and the Middle East, and in the world's top 100 universities in the 2022 Academic Ranking of World Universities.[8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMain article: History of the Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology\n\n![](image)Albert Einstein at Technion; 11 February 1923\nThe Technikum was conceived in the early 1900s by the German-Jewish fund Ezrah as a school of engineering and sciences. It was to be the only institution of higher learning in the then Ottoman Palestine, other than the Bezalel Academy of Art and Design in Jerusalem (founded in 1907). In October 1913, the board of trustees selected German as the language of instruction, provoking a major controversy known as the War of the Languages. After opposition from American and Russian Jews to the use of German, the board of trustees reversed itself in February 1914 and selected Hebrew as the language of instruction. The German name Technikum was also replaced by the Hebrew name Technion.[7][17]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n17. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Technion University Selects Hebrew as Language of Instruction\". *Center for Israel Education*. 22 February 2018.

In 1882, the name of the university was revised to The Western University and College of London, Ontario.[15] The first convocation of graduates was held on 27 April 1883.[13] Initially affiliated with the Church of England,[15] the university became non-denominational in 1908.\n\n\nIn 1916, the university's current site was purchased from the Kingsmill family. There are two World War I memorial plaques in University College. The first lists the 19 students and graduates of the University of Western Ontario who died; the second honours the men from Middlesex County who died.[16][17] A third plaque lists those who served with the No. 10 Canadian General hospital during WWII, the unit raised and equipped by UWO.[17]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWestern is a co-educational university, with more than 24,000 students, and over 306,000 living alumni worldwide. The university is a member of the U15, a group of research-intensive universities in Canada. Western's varsity teams, known as the Western Mustangs, compete in the Ontario University Athletics conference of U Sports.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nThe university was founded on 7 March 1878 by Bishop Isaac Hellmuth of the Anglican Diocese of Huron as The Western University of London, Ontario,[2] and its first chancellor was Chief Justice Richard Martin Meredith.[11] It incorporated Huron College, which had been founded in 1863.[12] The first four faculties were Arts, Divinity, Law and Medicine (London Medical College).[13] There were originally only 15 students when classes began in 1881.[14][11]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"An Act respecting The University of Western Ontario\" (PDF). *The University of Western Ontario*.

The building was completed in 1960, shortly after the faculty was established.\nIn 2012, the university rebranded itself as \"Western University\" to give the school less of a regional or even national identity. \"We want to be international,\" president Dr. Amit Chakma told *The Globe and Mail*. The university's legal name, however, remains \"The University of Western Ontario\" and is used on transcripts and diplomas.[24]\n\n\n\n## Campus[edit]\n\n\nThe University of Western Ontario is in the city of London, Ontario, in the southwestern end of the Quebec City\u2013Windsor Corridor. Most of the campus is surrounded by residential neighbourhoods, with the Thames River bisecting the campus' eastern portion.

The same year, shortly after the suppression of the State University, the Catholic University of Belgium moved to Louvain.[7] It took advantage of the reputation of the city as an ancient university centre and adopted a new name: Catholic University of Louvain (Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain).\n\n\nIn a Catholic spirit inspired by Pope Gregory XVI,[8] the promoter and first rector of the university, Monseigneur de Ram, wanted to create a shield that would repulse religion's enemies and block every doctrine weakening the base of Catholic society.\n\n\nThe pharmacy school was founded in 1845 and the engineering school in 1865.\n\n\nIn 1884 the Catholic University of Louvain celebrated its fiftieth anniversary.[9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPublic university in Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium\n\nFor the university founded in 1425, see Old University of Louvain.

This university was the centre of Baianism, Jansenism[3] and Febronianism in Europe. A new university, the State University of Louvain, was founded in 1817 and abolished by the law in 1835. A new catholic university was founded in Mechlin in 1834, the *Catholic* University of Mechlin and moved in Leuven in 1835 that is frequently, but controversially, identified as a continuation of the older institution.AB In 1968 the Catholic University of Leuven split into the Dutch-language *Katholieke Universiteit Leuven*, which stayed in Leuven, and the French-language *Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain*, which moved to Louvain-la-Neuve in Wallonia, 30\u00a0km southeast of Brussels. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn September 2018, the University of Louvain (or UCL until then) and Saint-Louis University, Brussels *de facto* merged, founding the *UCLouvain*, a denomination they currently share.\n\n\n\n## Chronology[edit]\n\n\nIn 1425, Dukes of Brabant created the University of Louvain[4] (Universit\u00e9 de Louvain), which was suppressed under Joseph II, reopened in 1790, and was finally closed under the French Republic in 1797.[5]\n\n\nIn 1817, the State University of Louvain (*Universit\u00e9 de l'Etat de Louvain*) was founded, which closed 15 August 1835.[6]\n\n\nIn 1834, the Catholic bishops of Belgium created the Catholic University of Belgium (Universit\u00e9 catholique de Belgique) in Mechlin, also known as the Catholic University of Malines (Universit\u00e9 catholique de Malines).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n28.\u00a0: \"le jans\u00e9nisme r\u00e9gnait en ma\u00eetre \u00e0 l'universit\u00e9 de Louvain\".\n4. **^** Universalis, Encyclop\u00e6dia. \"UNIVERSIT\u00c9 DE LOUVAIN\". *Encyclop\u00e6dia Universalis*.

This might also refer to a short-lived but historically important State University of Leuven, 1817\u20131835.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nIn the 15th century the civil administration of the town of Leuven, with the support of John IV, Duke of Brabant,[13] a prince of the House of Valois, made a formal request to the Holy See for a university.[14]\n\n\nPope Martin V issued a papal bull dated 9 December 1425 founding the University in Leuven as a *Studium Generale*. This university was institutionally independent of the local ecclesiastical hierarchy.\n\n\nFrom the founding of the university to its abolition in 1797, Latin was the sole language of instruction.[15]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Jean de Bourgogne (John IV, Duke of Brabant), founder of the University of Louvain in 1425: *Primus Academiae Conditor fuit Ioannes Quartus, Lotharingiae, Brabantiae, et Limburgiae Dux, Marchio Sacri Imperii*.[2]\n![](image)Portrait of the Pope Martin V, author of the bulla confirming on December 9, 1425, the creation of the University of Louvain: *\u00e0 Johanne IV.

This institution was founded with the intention of restoring the confessionally Catholic pre-Revolutionary traditions of learning in Leuven.[31][32] In 1968 this split to form the two current institutions: the Dutch language Katholieke Universiteit Leuven and the French language Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain.\n\n\n\n## Library[edit]\n\n\nFrom the founding of the university in 1425 up until 1636, there was no official library of the university. Very likely the students had access to manuscripts and printed books preserved in the homes of their professors or colleges.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* 1884: Arthur Verhaeghen, *Les cinquante derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es de l'ancienne Universit\u00e9 de Louvain*, Li\u00e8ge, 1884.\n* 1945: L\u00e9on van der Essen, *L'universit\u00e9 de Louvain*, Brussels, 1945.\n* F.
