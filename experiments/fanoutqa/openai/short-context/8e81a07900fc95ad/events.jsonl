For that reason, some observers refer to the German political system as a \"chancellor democracy\". Even though the office of chancellor is often considered the most powerful in the German political system and is seen as such within the German public, it is only the third highest office, following the head of state, the President of Germany, and the President of the Bundestag, a position similar to the speaker of the federal parliament.\n\n\nWhichever major party (CDU/CSU or SPD) does not hold the chancellorship usually calls its leading candidate for the federal election \"chancellor-candidate\" (*Kanzlerkandidat*). The federal government (*Bundesregierung*) consists of the chancellor and cabinet ministers.\n\n\n\n### Role[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nII |\n| *Vice Chancellor Walter Scheel served as acting Chancellor from 7 May to 16 May 1974.* |\n| 5\n | ![](image) | **Helmut Schmidt**(1918–2015) | May 16, 1974–October 1, 1982 | 8 years, 138 days\n | SPD | Hans-Dietrich Genscher (1974–1982)Egon Franke (1982) | I\n\n---\n\nII\n\n---\n\nIII |\n| 6\n | ![](image) | **Helmut Kohl**(1930–2017) | October 1, 1982–October 27, 1998 | 16 years, 26 days\n | CDU | Hans-Dietrich Genscher (1982–1992)\n\n---\n\nJürgen Möllemann (1992–1993)\n\n---\n\nKlaus Kinkel (1993–1998) | I\n\n---\n\nII\n\n---\n\nIII\n\n---\n\nIV\n\n---\n\nV |\n| 7\n | ![](image) | **Gerhard Schröder**(b. 1944) | October 27, 1998–November 22, 2005 | 7 years, 26 days\n | SPD | Joschka Fischer (1998–2005) | I\n\n---\n\nII |\n| 8\n | ![](image) | **Angela Merkel**(b. 1954) | November 22, 2005–December 8, 2021 | 16 years, 16 days\n | CDU | Franz Müntefering (2005–2007)Frank-Walter Steinmeier (2007–2009)Guido Westerwelle (2009–2011)Philipp Rösler (2011–2013)Sigmar Gabriel (2013–2018)Olaf Scholz (2018–2021) | I\n\n---\n\nII\n\n---\n\nIII\n\n---\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIV |\n| 9\n | ![](image) | **Olaf Scholz**(b. 1958) | December 8, 2021–*Incumbent* | 2 years, 188 days\n | SPD | Robert Habeck (*Incumbent*) | I |\n\n\n### Election mechanism[edit]\n\n\nThe chancellor is elected by the Bundestag and formally appointed by the president of Germany.

The president formally appoints and dismisses cabinet ministers, on the recommendation of the chancellor; no parliamentary approval is needed. According to the Basic Law, the chancellor may set the number of cabinet ministers and dictate their specific duties. Chancellor Ludwig Erhard had the largest cabinet, with 22 ministers, in the mid-1960s. Helmut Kohl presided over 17 ministers at the start of his fourth term in 1994; the 2002 cabinet, the second of Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, had 13 ministers, and the Angela Merkel cabinet as of 22 November 2005 had 15.\n\n\nArticle 65 of the Basic Law sets forth three principles that define how the executive branch functions:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nChancellors of Germany (since 1867)\n |\n| --- |\n| North German Confederation ![Flag of Germany](image)  Bundeskanzler (1867–1871) | * Otto von Bismarck\n |\n| German Empire ![Flag of Germany](image)  Reichskanzler (1871–1918) | * Otto von Bismarck\n* Leo von Caprivi\n* Prince Chlodwig zu Hohenlohe-Schillingsfürst\n* Bernhard von Bülow\n* Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg\n* Georg Michaelis\n* Georg von Hertling\n* Prince Maximilian of Baden\n |\n| Weimar Republic ![Flag of Germany](image)  Reichskanzler (1919–1933) | * Friedrich Ebert\n* Philipp Scheidemann (as Ministerpräsident)\n* Gustav Bauer (as Ministerpräsident, later Chancellor)\n* Hermann Müller\n* Constantin Fehrenbach\n* Joseph Wirth\n* Wilhelm Cuno\n* Gustav Stresemann\n* Wilhelm Marx\n* Hans Luther\n* Wilhelm Marx\n* Hermann Müller\n* Heinrich Brüning\n* Franz von Papen\n* Kurt von Schleicher\n |\n| Nazi Germany ![Flag of Germany](image) Reichskanzler (1933–1945) | * Adolf Hitler\n* Joseph Goebbels\n* Count Schwerin von Krosigk (as Leading Minister)\n |\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_itnUrBBYbpThCLCtLTX7BcIU","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

The office was established in its current form by the Constitution of 1978 and it was first regulated in 1823 as a chairmanship of the extant Council of Ministers, although it is not possible to determine when it actually originated.\n\n\nUpon a vacancy, the Spanish monarch nominates a presidency candidate for a vote of confidence by the Congress of Deputies, the lower house of the Cortes Generales (parliament). The process is a parliamentarian investiture by which the head of government is indirectly elected by the elected Congress of Deputies. In practice, the prime minister is almost always the leader of the largest party in the Congress.

If the Congress does not give the premier its confidence, the prime minister muse offer the monarch its resignation, starting the procedure explained in the second paragraph. As of 2023, only prime minister Adolfo Suárez in 1980 and Felipe González in 1990 proposed a vote of confidence, both successful.[43]\n\n\n\n## Precedence, privileges and form of address[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Prime Minister Adolfo Suárez (left), next to King Juan Carlos I as the second authority of the country in 1980.\nThe prime minister is the second authority of the Kingdom of Spain, outranking all other State authorities except members of the royal family.[44]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Adolfo Suárez delivers his inaugural address to the Congress of Deputies at the Palacio de las Cortes, Madrid on March 30, 1979.The Republican Constitution of 1931 provided for the prime minister and the rest of the government to be appointed and dismissed by the President of the Republic but they were responsible before the Parliament and the Parliament could vote to dismiss the prime minister or a minister even against the will of the president of the republic.[22] In the Civil War, the head of government among the Nationalists was called *Chief of the Government of the State* and since January 1938 the office acquired the current name, *President of the Government,* but between that date and 1973 the office was held by Francisco Franco as dictator of Spain.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1973, Francisco Franco separated the head of state from the head of government, and that division still exists today, with the prime minister democratically elected by the Parliament which is itself elected by universal suffrage, free and equal. Adolfo Suárez was the first democratically elected prime minister of the post-Franco government. He was originally appointed by King Juan Carlos I on 3 July 1976, and he was confirmed in the office by popular vote after the 1977 Spanish general election.[23]\n\n\n\n## Royal nomination and congressional confirmation[edit]\n\n\nOnce a general election has been called by the monarch, political parties designate their candidates to stand for prime minister—usually the party leader. A prime minister is dismissed from office the day after the election, but remains in office as a caretaker until his/her successor is sworn in.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Ousted prime minister Mariano Rajoy greeting prime minister–designated Pedro Sánchez after his successful vote of no confidence.\nIf a prime minister resigns without advising the monarch to call for new elections, dies or becomes incapacitated while in office, then the government as a whole resigns and the process of royal nomination and appointment takes place. The deputy prime minister, or in the absence of such office, the first minister by precedence, would then take over the day-to-day operations in the meantime as acting-prime minister, even while the deputy prime minister themselves may be nominated by the monarch and stand for a vote of confidence. Also, if at the conclusion of the four years, the prime minister has not asked for its dissolution, according to Title II Section 56, the monarch must dissolve the Parliament and call for a new general election.[40]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Politics of Spain\n |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) |\n|  |\n| Constitution\n* **Constitution**\n* **Constitutional Court**\n\t+ President\n\t\t- Cándido Conde-Pumpido\n\t+ Vice President\n\t\t- Inmaculada Montalbán Huertas\n* Constitutional history\n* Spanish transition to democracy\n* Human rights\n* Taxation\n* Law\nAbortion\nNationality\nCapital punishment\nLife imprisonment\n |\n| The Crown\n**Royal Household**\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n* **The Monarch** (list)\nFelipe VI\n* **Heir presumptive** (list)\nLeonor, Princess of Asturias\n* Royal family\n* Succession to the Spanish throne\n |\n| Executive\n**Government of the Nation**\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_b1AwH63T3wWwa4SLeSNp4WLW","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

During Goulart's absence, the president of the Chamber of deputies, Ranieri Mazzilli, took office as acting president of Brazil. There was then a plot to block the inauguration of the vice president as president, but Congressional resistance to the inauguration of Goulart led to a reaction by the governor of Rio Grande do Sul, who led a \"legality campaign\", and to a split in the military (that, during the fourth Republic, intervened heavily in politics).

Therefore, the first civilian president since 1964 was Tancredo's running mate, José Sarney, himself an ex-member of ARENA. José Sarney's administration fulfilled Tancredo's campaign promise of passing a constitutional amendment to the Constitution inherited from the military regime, so as to summon elections for a National Constituent Assembly with full powers to draft and adopt a new Constitution for the country, to replace the authoritarian legislation that still remained in place. In October 1988, a new democratic Constitution was passed and democracy was consolidated. In 1989, the first elections for president under the new Constitution were held and the young Fernando Collor de Mello was elected for a five-year term, the first president to be elected by direct popular ballot since the military coup. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Jânio Quadros (1961) **¤**\n* Ranieri Mazzilli (1961)\n* João Goulart (1961–1964) **×**\n |\n| Military dictatorship(1964–85) | * Ranieri Mazzilli (1964)\n* Castelo Branco (1964–1967)\n* Costa e Silva (1967–1969) **†**\n* Pedro Aleixo (*posthumous*)\n* Military Junta (1969)\n* Emílio Garrastazu Médici (1969–1974)\n* Ernesto Geisel (1974–1979)\n* João Figueiredo (1979–1985)\n |\n| New Republic(1985–present) | * Tancredo Neves (*never took office*)\n* José Sarney (1985–1990)\n* Collor de Mello (1990–1992) **¤**\n* Itamar Franco (1992–1995)\n* Fernando H.

In 1903, he was appointed again head of the government after a period of instability. Giolitti was Prime Minister five times between 1892 and 1921 and the second-longest serving prime minister in Italian history.\n\n\nGiolitti was a master in the political art of *trasformismo*, the method of making a flexible, fluid centrist coalition in Parliament which sought to isolate the extremes of the left and the right in Italian politics. Under his influence, the Italian Liberals did not develop as a structured party. They were instead a series of informal personal groupings with no formal links to political constituencies.[6]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe prime minister is the president of the Council of Ministers which holds executive power and the position is similar to those in most other parliamentary systems. The formal Italian order of precedence lists the office as being, ceremonially, the fourth-highest Italian state office after the president and the presiding officers of the two houses of parliament. In practice, the prime minister is the country's political leader and *de facto* chief executive.\n\n\nGiorgia Meloni is the incumbent prime minister since 22 October 2022.\n\n\n\n\n## Functions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Chigi Palace in Rome, the seat of the Council of Ministers and the official residence of the Prime Minister of Italy.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe prime minister's activity has often consisted of mediating between the various parties in the majority coalition, rather than directing the activity of the Council of Ministers. The prime minister's supervisory power is further limited by the lack of any formal authority to fire ministers. In the past, in order to make a cabinet reshuffle, prime ministers have sometimes resigned so that they could be re-appointed by the president and allowed to form a new cabinet with new ministers. In order to do this the prime minister needs the support of the president, who could theoretically refuse to re-appoint them following their resignation.\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of prime ministers of Italy\n\nThe office was first established in 1848 in Italy's predecessor state, the Kingdom of Sardinia—although it was not mentioned in its constitution, the Albertine Statute.\n\n\n\n### Historical Right and Historical Left[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn October 2022, President Mattarella appointed Giorgia Meloni as Italy's first female Prime Minister, following the resignation of Mario Draghi amidst a government crisis and a general election.[23]\n\n\n\n## Living former prime ministers of Italy[edit]\n\n\nAs of 15 June 2024, there are ten living former prime ministers.

The following list therefore includes those who have been referred to as various other titles since the creation of the Council of Ministers in 1823.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* **Prime Minister** (list)\n\t+ Pedro Sánchez\n* **Deputy Prime Minister** (list)\n\t+ María Jesús Montero (first)\n\t+ Yolanda Díaz (second)\n\t+ Teresa Ribera (third)\n* **Council of Ministers**\n\t+ Sánchez III Government\n* Ministries\n* Government Delegations\n* Government Delegated Committees\n* Interministerial Committees\n* Spanish prime-ministerial transition\n* List of agencies in Spain\n* Council of State\n* Economic and Social Council\n |\n| Legislature\n**Cortes Generales**(15th Cortes Generales)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n* **Senate** (15th Senate)\n\t+ Speaker (list)\n\t\t- Pedro Rollán\n* **Congress of Deputies** (15th Congress)\n\t+ Speaker (list)\n\t\t- Francina Armengol\n* Parliamentary groups\n* Permanent Deputation\n* Bureaus of the Cortes Generales\n* Board of Spokespersons\n* People's Defender (ombudsman)\n* Solemn Opening of the Parliament of Spain\n |\n| Judiciary\n**General Council of the Judiciary**\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n* Top left: Francisco Martínez de la Rosa was the first prime minister constitutionally referred to as such.\n* Top right: Francisco Franco was the person serving the longest as head of government under a dictatorship.\n* Bottom left: Felipe González was the longest serving democratically-elected prime minister.\n* Bottom right: Pedro Sánchez is the current prime minister.\n\n\n\n| Politics of Spain\n |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) |\n|  |\n| Constitution\n* **Constitution**\n* **Constitutional Court**\n\t+ President\n\t\t- Cándido Conde-Pumpido\n\t+ Vice President\n\t\t- Inmaculada Montalbán Huertas\n* Constitutional history\n* Spanish transition to democracy\n* Human rights\n* Taxation\n* Law\nAbortion\nNationality\nCapital punishment\nLife imprisonment\n |\n| The Crown\n**Royal Household**\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n* **The Monarch** (list)\nFelipe VI\n* **Heir presumptive** (list)\nLeonor, Princess of Asturias\n* Royal family\n* Succession to the Spanish throne\n |\n| Executive\n**Government of the Nation**\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| ![](image) | **Felipe González**(born 1942) | 2 December1982\n | 24 July1986\n | 13 years and 155 days\n |  | PSOE | González IPSOE | 1982 | [308][309][310][311][312] |\n| 24 July1986\n | 6 December1989\n | González IIPSOE | 1986 |\n| 6 December1989\n | 14 July1993\n | González IIIPSOE | 1989 |\n| 14 July1993\n | 5 May1996\n | González IVPSOE | 1993 |\n| ![](image) | **José María Aznar**(born 1953) | 5 May1996\n | 27 April2000\n | 7 years and 349 days\n |  | PP | Aznar IPP | 1996 | [313][314][315] |\n| 27 April2000\n | 17 April2004\n | Aznar IIPP | 2000 |\n| ![](image) | **José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero**(born 1960) | 17 April2004\n | 12 April2008\n | 7 years and 248 days\n |  | PSOE | Zapatero IPSOE | 2004 | [316][317][318] |\n| 12 April2008\n | 21 December2011\n | Zapatero IIPSOE | 2008 |\n| ![](image) | **Mariano Rajoy**(born 1955) | 21 December2011\n | 31 October2016\n | 6 years and 162 days\n |  | PP | Rajoy IPP | 2011 | [319][320][321][322] |\n| King**Felipe VI**![](image)(2014–present) |\n| 2015 |\n| 31 October2016\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | 1 June2018*(censured)* | Rajoy IIPP | 2016 |\n| ![](image) | **Pedro Sánchez**(born 1972) | 2 June2018\n | 8 January2020\n | 6 years and 13 days\n |  | PSOE | Sánchez IPSOE | [323][324][325] |\n| Apr. 2019 |\n| 8 January2020\n | 17 November2023\n | Sánchez IIPSOE–UP/Sumar | Nov. 2019 |\n| 17 November2023\n | Incumbent\n | Sánchez IIIPSOE–Sumar | 2023 |\n\n\n## Timeline[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Portrait\n | Name(Birth–Death) | Term of office\n | Party\n | GovernmentComposition | Election\n | Monarch(Reign) | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Took office | Left office | Duration |\n| ![](image) | **Carlos Arias Navarro**(1908–1989) | 5 December1975\n | 1 July1976\n | 209 days\n |  | NationalMovement(Nonpartisan) | Arias Navarro IINational Movement | N/A | King**Juan Carlos I**![](image)(1975–2014) | [299] |\n| *During this interval, First Deputy Prime Minister Fernando de Santiago served as acting officeholder.* |\n| ![](image) | **Adolfo Suárez**(1932–2014) | 5 July1976\n | 17 June1977\n | 4 years and 236 days\n |  | NationalMovement(UDPE) | Suárez INational Movement[n] | [302][303][304][305] |\n| 17 June1977\n | 2 April1979\n |  | UCD | Suárez IIUCD | 1977 |\n| 2 April1979\n | 26 February1981\n | Suárez IIIUCD | 1979 |\n| ![](image) | **Leopoldo Calvo-Sotelo**(1926–2008) | 26 February1981\n | 2 December1982\n | 1 year and 279 days\n | Calvo-SoteloUCD | [306][307] |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* First Secretary of State (1823–1834)\n* President of the Council of Ministers (1834–1868;

Between 1938 and 1973, the post of President of the Government was personally linked to the person serving as Head of State.\n\n\n\n\n## Before 1823[edit]\n\n\nThere is no specific date when the office of prime minister first appeared as the role was not created, but rather evolved over a period of time through merger of duties. The government was led by a *Valido*, a favourite of the Monarch or the ruling Regent. Since 1621, there was also a Secretary of State of the Universal Bureau (*Secretario de Estado y del Despacho Universal*), but this seems to have been rather a subordinate position.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | 20 December1973†*(assassinated)* | 195 days\n | Carrero BlancoNational Movement | [296][297] |\n| *During this interval, Deputy Prime Minister Torcuato Fernández-Miranda served as acting officeholder.* |\n| ![](image) | **Carlos Arias Navarro**(1908–1989) | 31 December1973\n | 5 December1975\n | 1 year and 341 days\n |  | NationalMovement(Nonpartisan) | Arias Navarro INational Movement | [298] |\n| Regency Council[m](1975) |\n\n\n### Kingdom of Spain (1975–present)[edit]\n\n\n**Governments:**\n\n\n\n* National Movement\n* UCD\n* PSOE\n* PP\n* Mixed coalition\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n316. **^** \"Real Decreto 552/2004, de 16 de abril, por el que se nombra Presidente del Gobierno a don José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero\" (PDF). *Boletín Oficial del Estado* (in Spanish) (93).
