For that reason, some observers refer to the German political system as a \"chancellor democracy\". Even though the office of chancellor is often considered the most powerful in the German political system and is seen as such within the German public, it is only the third highest office, following the head of state, the President of Germany, and the President of the Bundestag, a position similar to the speaker of the federal parliament.\n\n\nWhichever major party (CDU/CSU or SPD) does not hold the chancellorship usually calls its leading candidate for the federal election \"chancellor-candidate\" (*Kanzlerkandidat*). The federal government (*Bundesregierung*) consists of the chancellor and cabinet ministers.\n\n\n\n### Role[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nII |\n| *Vice Chancellor Walter Scheel served as acting Chancellor from 7 May to 16 May 1974.* |\n| 5\n | ![](image) | **Helmut Schmidt**(1918\u20132015) | May 16, 1974\u2013October 1, 1982 | 8\u00a0years, 138\u00a0days\n | SPD | Hans-Dietrich Genscher (1974\u20131982)Egon Franke (1982) | I\n\n---\n\nII\n\n---\n\nIII |\n| 6\n | ![](image) | **Helmut Kohl**(1930\u20132017) | October 1, 1982\u2013October 27, 1998 | 16\u00a0years, 26\u00a0days\n | CDU | Hans-Dietrich Genscher (1982\u20131992)\n\n---\n\nJ\u00fcrgen M\u00f6llemann (1992\u20131993)\n\n---\n\nKlaus Kinkel (1993\u20131998) | I\n\n---\n\nII\n\n---\n\nIII\n\n---\n\nIV\n\n---\n\nV |\n| 7\n | ![](image) | **Gerhard Schr\u00f6der**(b. 1944) | October 27, 1998\u2013November 22, 2005 | 7\u00a0years, 26\u00a0days\n | SPD | Joschka Fischer (1998\u20132005) | I\n\n---\n\nII |\n| 8\n | ![](image) | **Angela Merkel**(b. 1954) | November 22, 2005\u2013December 8, 2021 | 16\u00a0years, 16\u00a0days\n | CDU | Franz M\u00fcntefering (2005\u20132007)Frank-Walter Steinmeier (2007\u20132009)Guido Westerwelle (2009\u20132011)Philipp R\u00f6sler (2011\u20132013)Sigmar Gabriel (2013\u20132018)Olaf Scholz (2018\u20132021) | I\n\n---\n\nII\n\n---\n\nIII\n\n---\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIV |\n| 9\n | ![](image) | **Olaf Scholz**(b. 1958) | December 8, 2021\u2013*Incumbent* | 2\u00a0years, 188\u00a0days\n | SPD | Robert Habeck (*Incumbent*) | I |\n\n\n### Election mechanism[edit]\n\n\nThe chancellor is elected by the Bundestag and formally appointed by the president of Germany.

The office was established in its current form by the Constitution of 1978 and it was first regulated in 1823 as a chairmanship of the extant Council of Ministers, although it is not possible to determine when it actually originated.\n\n\nUpon a vacancy, the Spanish monarch nominates a presidency candidate for a vote of confidence by the Congress of Deputies, the lower house of the Cortes Generales (parliament). The process is a parliamentarian investiture by which the head of government is indirectly elected by the elected Congress of Deputies. In practice, the prime minister is almost always the leader of the largest party in the Congress. Since current constitutional practice in Spain calls for the monarch to act on the advice of his ministers, the prime minister is the country's *de facto* chief executive.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * President of the Government of Spain\n* First Vice President of the Government of Spain\n* Second Vice President of the Government of Spain\n* Third Vice President of the Government of Spain\n* Office of the Prime Minister\n* Minister of Foreign Affairs, European Union and Cooperation\n* Ministry of the Presidency, Justice and Relations with the Cortes\n* Ministry of Defence\n* Minister of Finance\n* Ministry of the Interior\n* Minister of Transport and Sustainable Mobility\n* Minister of Education, Vocational Training and Sports\n* Minister of Labour and Social Economy\n* Minister of Industry and Tourism\n* Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food\n* Minister of Territorial Policy and Democratic Memory\n* Minister for the Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge\n* Minister of Housing and Urban Agenda\n* Ministry of Culture\n* Minister of Economy, Trade and Business\n* Ministry of Health\n* Minister of Social Rights, Consumer Affairs and 2030 Agenda\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n6. **^** \"Sworn In as Prime Minister, Spain's S\u00e1nchez Readies Cabinet - The New York Times\". *www.nytimes.com*.

Spain was not unique in this regard: it was one of several European parliamentary systems including France, Italy and Ireland that styled the head of government as 'presidents' of the government rather than the Westminster term of 'prime minister' (see President of the Council for the full list of corresponding terms); similarly, the president of the Congress or Senate referred to the parliamentary speakers. This system of multiple distinct offices all labelled 'president' causes confusion among English-speakers: both President George W. Bush and his brother, Florida governor Jeb Bush, referred to Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar as \"president\" on separate occasions,[13][14] and Donald Trump referred to Mariano Rajoy both as \"President\" and \"Mr. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nPrime ministers of Spain\n |\n| --- |\n| Acting prime ministers shown in *italics*.\n |\n| Queen Isabella II(1833\u20131868) | * Mart\u00ednez de la Rosa\n* Toreno\n* \u00c1lava\n* \u00c1lvarez Mendiz\u00e1bal\n* Ist\u00fariz\n* *Calatrava*\n* Espartero\n* Bardaj\u00ed\n* Heredia-Sp\u00ednola\n* Fr\u00edas\n* *Alaix*\n* P\u00e9rez de Castro\n* A.

If the Congress does not give the premier its confidence, the prime minister muse offer the monarch its resignation, starting the procedure explained in the second paragraph. As of 2023, only prime minister Adolfo Su\u00e1rez in 1980 and Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez in 1990 proposed a vote of confidence, both successful.[43]\n\n\n\n## Precedence, privileges and form of address[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Prime Minister Adolfo Su\u00e1rez (left), next to King Juan Carlos I as the second authority of the country in 1980.\nThe prime minister is the second authority of the Kingdom of Spain, outranking all other State authorities except members of the royal family.[44]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Adolfo Su\u00e1rez delivers his inaugural address to the Congress of Deputies at the Palacio de las Cortes, Madrid on March 30, 1979.The Republican Constitution of 1931 provided for the prime minister and the rest of the government to be appointed and dismissed by the President of the Republic but they were responsible before the Parliament and the Parliament could vote to dismiss the prime minister or a minister even against the will of the president of the republic.[22] In the Civil War, the head of government among the Nationalists was called *Chief of the Government of the State* and since January 1938 the office acquired the current name, *President of the Government,* but between that date and 1973 the office was held by Francisco Franco as dictator of Spain.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1973, Francisco Franco separated the head of state from the head of government, and that division still exists today, with the prime minister democratically elected by the Parliament which is itself elected by universal suffrage, free and equal. Adolfo Su\u00e1rez was the first democratically elected prime minister of the post-Franco government. He was originally appointed by King Juan Carlos I on 3 July 1976, and he was confirmed in the office by popular vote after the 1977 Spanish general election.[23]\n\n\n\n## Royal nomination and congressional confirmation[edit]\n\n\nOnce a general election has been called by the monarch, political parties designate their candidates to stand for prime minister\u2014usually the party leader. A prime minister is dismissed from office the day after the election, but remains in office as a caretaker until his/her successor is sworn in.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Ousted prime minister Mariano Rajoy greeting prime minister\u2013designated Pedro S\u00e1nchez after his successful vote of no confidence.\nIf a prime minister resigns without advising the monarch to call for new elections, dies or becomes incapacitated while in office, then the government as a whole resigns and the process of royal nomination and appointment takes place. The deputy prime minister, or in the absence of such office, the first minister by precedence, would then take over the day-to-day operations in the meantime as acting-prime minister, even while the deputy prime minister themselves may be nominated by the monarch and stand for a vote of confidence. Also, if at the conclusion of the four years, the prime minister has not asked for its dissolution, according to Title II Section\u00a056, the monarch must dissolve the Parliament and call for a new general election.[40]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Politics of Spain\n |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) |\n|  |\n| Constitution\n* **Constitution**\n* **Constitutional Court**\n\t+ President\n\t\t- C\u00e1ndido Conde-Pumpido\n\t+ Vice President\n\t\t- Inmaculada Montalb\u00e1n Huertas\n* Constitutional history\n* Spanish transition to democracy\n* Human rights\n* Taxation\n* Law\nAbortion\nNationality\nCapital punishment\nLife imprisonment\n |\n| The Crown\n**Royal Household**\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n* **The Monarch** (list)\nFelipe VI\n* **Heir presumptive** (list)\nLeonor, Princess of Asturias\n* Royal family\n* Succession to the Spanish throne\n |\n| Executive\n**Government of the Nation**\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

However, the Christian Democrats remained the main government party. During Craxi's government, the economy recovered and Italy became the world's fifth-largest industrial nation, gaining entry into the Group of Seven, but as a result of his spending policies, the Italian national debt skyrocketed during the Craxi era, soon passing 100% of the GDP.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMussolini remained in power until he was deposed by King Victor Emmanuel III in 1943 following a vote of no confidence by the Grand Council of Fascism and replaced by General Pietro Badoglio. A few months later, Italy was invaded by Nazi Germany and Mussolini was reinstated as head of a puppet State called Italian Social Republic, while the authorities of the Kingdom were forced to relocate in Southern Italy, which was under the control of the Allied Forces. \n\n\nIn 1944 Badoglio resigned and Ivanoe Bonomi was appointed to the post of Prime Minister, restoring the old title of \"President of the Council of Ministers. Bonomi was briefly succeeded by Ferruccio Parri in 1945 and then by Alcide de Gasperi, leader of the newly formed Christian Democracy (*Democrazia Cristiana*, DC) political party.\n\n\n\n### First decades of the Italian Republic[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: History of the Italian Republic\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Giovanni Giolitti, longest-serving democratically elected Prime Minister in Italian history, and the second-longest serving overall after Benito Mussolini\nIn 1892, Giovanni Giolitti, a leftist lawyer and politician, was appointed Prime Minister by King Umberto I, but after less than a year he was forced to resign and Crispi returned to power. In 1903, he was appointed again head of the government after a period of instability. Giolitti was Prime Minister five times between 1892 and 1921 and the second-longest serving prime minister in Italian history.\n\n\nGiolitti was a master in the political art of *trasformismo*, the method of making a flexible, fluid centrist coalition in Parliament which sought to isolate the extremes of the left and the right in Italian politics. Under his influence, the Italian Liberals did not develop as a structured party. They were instead a series of informal personal groupings with no formal links to political constituencies.[6]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe prime minister is the president of the Council of Ministers which holds executive power and the position is similar to those in most other parliamentary systems. The formal Italian order of precedence lists the office as being, ceremonially, the fourth-highest Italian state office after the president and the presiding officers of the two houses of parliament. In practice, the prime minister is the country's political leader and *de facto* chief executive.\n\n\nGiorgia Meloni is the incumbent prime minister since 22 October 2022.\n\n\n\n\n## Functions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Chigi Palace in Rome, the seat of the Council of Ministers and the official residence of the Prime Minister of Italy.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe prime minister's activity has often consisted of mediating between the various parties in the majority coalition, rather than directing the activity of the Council of Ministers. The prime minister's supervisory power is further limited by the lack of any formal authority to fire ministers. In the past, in order to make a cabinet reshuffle, prime ministers have sometimes resigned so that they could be re-appointed by the president and allowed to form a new cabinet with new ministers. In order to do this the prime minister needs the support of the president, who could theoretically refuse to re-appoint them following their resignation.\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of prime ministers of Italy\n\nThe office was first established in 1848 in Italy's predecessor state, the Kingdom of Sardinia\u2014although it was not mentioned in its constitution, the Albertine Statute.\n\n\n\n### Historical Right and Historical Left[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn October 2022, President Mattarella appointed Giorgia Meloni as Italy's first female Prime Minister, following the resignation of Mario Draghi amidst a government crisis and a general election.[23]\n\n\n\n## Living former prime ministers of Italy[edit]\n\n\nAs of 15 June 2024, there are ten living former prime ministers.

The vice president was a political enemy of J\u00e2nio Quadros, the leftist Jo\u00e3o Goulart. Goulart was out of the country, and Congress was controlled by right wing politicians. During Goulart's absence, the president of the Chamber of deputies, Ranieri Mazzilli, took office as acting president of Brazil. There was then a plot to block the inauguration of the vice president as president, but Congressional resistance to the inauguration of Goulart led to a reaction by the governor of Rio Grande do Sul, who led a \"legality campaign\", and to a split in the military (that, during the fourth Republic, intervened heavily in politics). Amid the political crisis, the solution was the adoption by Congress of a Constitutional Amendment abolishing the presidential executive and replacing it with a parliamentary system of government. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| No. | Portrait\n | Name\n | Elected\n | Term of office\n | Political party\n | Vice president\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Took office\n | Left office\n | Time in office\n |\n| \u2014 | ![](image) | Tancredo Neves(1910\u20131985) | 1985 | *Never took office*[v] | PMDB | Jos\u00e9 Sarney(PMDB)\n |\n| 31 | ![](image) | Jos\u00e9 Sarney(born 1930) | \u2014\n | 15 March 1985\n | 15 March 1990\n | 5 years\n | PMDB | *Vacant* |\n| 32 | ![](image) | Fernando Collor(born 1949) | 1989 | 15 March 1990\n | 29 December 1992[w] | 2\u00a0years, 289\u00a0days\n | PRN | Itamar Franco(PRN/PMDB)\n |\n| 33 | ![](image) | Itamar Franco(1929\u20132011) | \u2014\n | 29 December 1992\n | 1 January 1995\n | 2\u00a0years, 3\u00a0days\n | PMDB | *Vacant* |\n| 34 | ![](image) | Fernando Henrique Cardoso(born 1931) | 1994 | 1 January 1995\n | 1 January 2003\n | 8 years\n | PSDB | Marco Maciel(PFL)\n |\n| 1998 |\n| 35 | ![](image) | Lula da Silva(born 1945) | 2002 | 1 January 2003\n | 1 January 2011\n | 8 years\n | PT | Jos\u00e9 Alencar(PL/PRB)\n |\n| 2006 |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 1995, Fernando Henrique Cardoso was inaugurated for a four-year term.

When the term of the last military president was to end, however, no direct elections for President of Brazil took place. For the election of the country's first civilian president since the military coup of 1964, the military maintained the rule that prevailed during the dictatorial regime, according to which an Electoral College made up of the entire National Congress and representatives from State Assemblies was to elect the president. This time, however, the military placed the Electoral College under no coercion, so that its members would be free to select the president of their choice. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHe was inaugurated in 1990 and in 1992 he became the first president in Brazil to be impeached due to corruption.

Therefore, the first civilian president since 1964 was Tancredo's running mate, Jos\u00e9 Sarney, himself an ex-member of ARENA. Jos\u00e9 Sarney's administration fulfilled Tancredo's campaign promise of passing a constitutional amendment to the Constitution inherited from the military regime, so as to summon elections for a National Constituent Assembly with full powers to draft and adopt a new Constitution for the country, to replace the authoritarian legislation that still remained in place. In October 1988, a new democratic Constitution was passed and democracy was consolidated. In 1989, the first elections for president under the new Constitution were held and the young Fernando Collor de Mello was elected for a five-year term, the first president to be elected by direct popular ballot since the military coup. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* J\u00e2nio Quadros (1961) **\u00a4**\n* Ranieri Mazzilli (1961)\n* Jo\u00e3o Goulart (1961\u20131964) **\u00d7**\n |\n| Military dictatorship(1964\u201385) | * Ranieri Mazzilli (1964)\n* Castelo Branco (1964\u20131967)\n* Costa e Silva (1967\u20131969) **\u2020**\n* Pedro Aleixo (*posthumous*)\n* Military Junta (1969)\n* Em\u00edlio Garrastazu M\u00e9dici (1969\u20131974)\n* Ernesto Geisel (1974\u20131979)\n* Jo\u00e3o Figueiredo (1979\u20131985)\n |\n| New Republic(1985\u2013present) | * Tancredo Neves (*never took office*)\n* Jos\u00e9 Sarney (1985\u20131990)\n* Collor de Mello (1990\u20131992) **\u00a4**\n* Itamar Franco (1992\u20131995)\n* Fernando H.

Jo\u00e3o Figueiredo became President in March 1979; in the same year he passed the Amnesty Law for political crimes committed for and against the regime. While combating the \"hardliners\" inside the government and supporting a re-democratization policy, Figueiredo could not control the crumbling economy, chronic inflation and concurrent fall of other military dictatorships in South America. Amid massive popular demonstrations in the streets of the main cities of the country, the first free elections in 20 years were held for the national legislature in 1982. In 1985, another election was held, this time to elect (indirectly) a new president, being contested between civilian candidates for the first time since the 1960s, being won by the opposition.

There is no specific date as to when the office of Prime Minister first appeared as the role was not created, but rather evolved over a period of time through a merger of duties. Modern historians have not managed to agree who the first prime minister of Spain was, but Francisco Mart\u00ednez de la Rosa was the first prime minister recognized by a constitutional law (the Spanish Royal Statute of 1834).\n\n\nIn contemporary Spain, the first Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Spain since the approval of the Constitution was Adolfo Su\u00e1rez. Due to the gradual evolution of the post, the title has been applied to early prime ministers retroactively. The following list therefore includes those who have been referred to as various other titles since the creation of the Council of Ministers in 1823.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* **Prime

Between 1938 and 1973, the post of President of the Government was personally linked to the person serving as Head of State.\n\n\n\n\n## Before 1823[edit]\n\n\nThere is no specific date when the office of prime minister first appeared as the role was not created, but rather evolved over a period of time through merger of duties. The government was led by a *Valido*, a favourite of the Monarch or the ruling Regent. Since 1621, there was also a Secretary of State of the Universal Bureau (*Secretario de Estado y del Despacho Universal*), but this seems to have been rather a subordinate position.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | 20 December1973\u2020*(assassinated)* | 195\u00a0days\n | Carrero BlancoNational Movement | [296][297] |\n| *During this interval, Deputy Prime Minister Torcuato Fern\u00e1ndez-Miranda served as acting officeholder.* |\n| ![](image) | **Carlos Arias Navarro**(1908\u20131989) | 31 December1973\n | 5 December1975\n | 1\u00a0year and 341\u00a0days\n |  | NationalMovement(Nonpartisan) | Arias Navarro INational Movement | [298] |\n| Regency Council[m](1975) |\n\n\n### Kingdom of Spain (1975\u2013present)[edit]\n\n\n**Governments:**\n\n\n\n* National Movement\n* UCD\n* PSOE\n* PP\n* Mixed coalition\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n316. **^** \"Real Decreto 552/2004, de 16 de abril, por el que se nombra Presidente del Gobierno a don Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero\" (PDF). *Bolet\u00edn Oficial del Estado* (in Spanish) (93).
