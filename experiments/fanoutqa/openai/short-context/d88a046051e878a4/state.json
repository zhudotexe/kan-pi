Between 1970 and 2011, non-Hispanic whites declined from 80% of the state's population to 40%, while Hispanics grew from 32% in 2000 to 38% in 2011.[224] It is currently projected that Hispanics will rise to 49% of the population by 2060, primarily due to domestic births rather than immigration.[225] With the decline of immigration from Latin America, Asian Americans now constitute the fastest growing racial/ethnic group in California; this growth is primarily driven by immigration from China, India and the Philippines, respectively.[226]\n\n\nMost of California's immigrant population are born in Mexico (3.9 million), the Philippines (825,200), China (768,400), India (556,500) and Vietnam (502,600).[227]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n202. **^** \"About Los Angeles County Department of Public Social Services\".

However, the state in 1913 passed the Alien Land Act, excluding Asian immigrants from owning land.[98] During World War II, Japanese Americans in California were interned in concentration camps such as at Tule Lake and Manzanar.[99] In 2020, California officially apologized for this internment.[100]\n\n\nMigration to California accelerated during the early 20th century with the completion of major transcontinental highways like the Lincoln Highway and Route 66. In the period from 1900 to 1965, the population grew from fewer than one million to the greatest in the Union. In 1940, the Census Bureau reported California's population as 6.0% Hispanic, 2.4% Asian, and 89.5% non-Hispanic white.[101]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs of 2011[update], 75.1% of California's population younger than age 1 were minorities, meaning they had at least one parent who was not non-Hispanic white (white Hispanics are counted as minorities).[221]\n\n\nIn terms of total numbers, California has the largest population of White Americans in the United States, an estimated 22,200,000 residents. The state has the 5th largest population of African Americans in the United States, an estimated 2,250,000 residents. California's Asian American population is estimated at 4.4\u00a0million, constituting a third of the nation's total. California's Native American population of 285,000 is the most of any state.[222]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Immigration from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 820,388 people, and migration within the country produced a net loss of about 800,213.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe distribution of change in population growth is uneven in the State of New York; the New York City metropolitan area is growing considerably, along with Saratoga County, and Western New York. The rest of the state is nearly stagnant. According to immigration statistics, the state is a leading recipient of migrants from around the globe. Since 2005, immigration failed to surpass emigration, a trend that was reversed since 2006. The State of New York lost two house seats in the 2011 congressional reapportionment, secondary to relatively slow growth when compared to the rest of the United States.\n\n\nThe center of population of New York is located in Orange County, in the town of Deerpark. Roughly 64% of the state's population lives in the New York City metropolitan area and 40% in New York City alone.[3]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Manhattan Chinatown (\u7d10\u7d04\u83ef\u57e0).

Its residents include people from a wide variety of ethnic, racial, national and religious backgrounds. The state has attracted immigrants, particularly from Latin America.[8] Florida's majority ethnic group are European Americans, with approximately 65% of the population identifying as White. National ethnic communities in the state include Cubans, who migrated *en masse* following the revolution in the mid 20th century. They have been joined by other immigrants from Latin America, and Spanish is spoken by more than 20% of the state's population, with high usage especially in the Miami-Dade County area.\n\n\nBetween the 2010 and 2020 census, 50 counties would experience growth in their population while 17 counties saw their populations decline. Most of Florida's population lives in urban areas as in the 2020 census, close to 97% of people in Florida resided in metropolitan areas.[9]\n\n\n\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWith a population of 21.5 million according to the 2020 census, Florida is the most populous state in the Southeastern United States, and the second-most populous state in the South behind Texas.

Illinois' population slightly declined in 2020 from the 2010 United States census by just over 18,000 residents and the overall population was quite higher than recent census estimates.[83]\n\n\nIllinois is the most populous state in the Midwest region. Chicago, the third-most populous city in the United States, is the center of the Chicago metropolitan area or Chicagoland, as this area is nicknamed. Although the Chicago metropolitan area comprises only 9% of the land area of the state, it contains 65% of the state's residents. The losses of population anticipated from the 2020 census results do not arise from the Chicago metro area; rather the declines are from the Downstate counties.[84]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Police and protesters at the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago.\n![](image)Rising waters in Alton in 1993.\nAt the turn of the 20th century, Illinois had a population of nearly 5\u00a0million. Many people from other parts of the country were attracted to the state by employment caused by the expanding industrial base. Whites were 98% of the state's population.[46] Bolstered by continued immigration from southern and eastern Europe, and by the African-American Great Migration from the South, Illinois grew and emerged as one of the most important states in the union. By the end of the century, the population had reached 12.4\u00a0million.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n88. **^** \"Historical Census Statistics on Population Totals By Race, 1790 to 1990, and By Hispanic Origin, 1970 to 1990, For The United States, Regions, Divisions, and States\". *Census.gov*.
