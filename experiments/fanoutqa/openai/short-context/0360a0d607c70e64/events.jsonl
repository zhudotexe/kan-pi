Traditionally, the eastern terminus of the wall was considered to be Shanhai Pass (Shanhaiguan) on the coast of the Bohai (Gulf of Zhili), and the wall's length – without its branches and other secondary sections – was thought to extend for some 6,690 km (4,160 mi).\n6. **^** Shelach-Lavi, Gideon; Wachtel, Ido; Golan, Dan; Batzorig, Otgonjargal; Amartuvshin, Chunag; Ellenblum, Ronnie; Honeychurch, William (June 2020). \"Medieval long-wall construction on the Mongolian Steppe during the eleventh to thirteenth centuries AD\". *Antiquity*. **94** (375): 724–741. doi:10.15184/aqy.2020.51.

While visitors can walk around them, they can no longer climb them or go inside their chambers. Climbing access to El Castillo was closed after a San Diego, California, woman fell to her death in 2006.[50]\n\n\n\n## Photograph gallery[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n62. **^** El Chichán Chob y la Casa del Venado, Chichén Itzá, Yucatán.
