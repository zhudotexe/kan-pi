Jackson himself considered South Carolina as his birth state.[1]\n\n\nBorn on December 5, 1782, Martin Van Buren was the first president born an American citizen (and not a British subject).[2]\n\n\nThe term Virginia dynasty is sometimes used to describe the fact that four of the first five U.S. presidents were from Virginia.\n\n\nThe number of presidents per state in which they were born, counting Jackson as being from South Carolina, are:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| State | # | Presidents (*in order of presidency*)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\u00a0New York | 7\n | Martin Van Buren (8), Millard Fillmore (13), Chester A.

In instances where a physical structure is absent, a monument or roadside marker has been erected to denote the site's historic significance. All sites in the table below are listed in the National Register of Historic Places.\n\n\nA dramatic shift in childbirth from home to hospital occurred in the United States in the early 20th century (mid\u20131920s to 1940).[4] Reflective of this trend, Jimmy Carter and all presidents born during and after World War II (Bill Clinton and every president since) have been born in a hospital, not a private residence.
