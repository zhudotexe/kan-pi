Then he returned to his native country in January 2001,[4] where he played for Budućnost Podgorica until the summer of 2003.\n\n\nVraneš was selected by the National Basketball Association's New York Knicks in the second round of the 2003 NBA draft.[5][6][7] He was waived by the Knicks in December 2003 before ever playing a game for them.[8] In early January 2004, he signed a ten-day contract with Portland Trail Blazers. Before his contract expired, he played one game in the 2003–04 NBA season.\n\n\nThat one game for Portland ended up being Vraneš first and only game in the NBA. The game took place on January 8, 2004, in a 75–96 loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves where Vraneš played for 3 minutes and recorded 1 foul and no other stats.[9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_kz5f421CBFnod4LzSzFEBmJI","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
