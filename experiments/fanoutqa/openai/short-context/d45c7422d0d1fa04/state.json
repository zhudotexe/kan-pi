If measured using an interval of 125\u00a0mi (200\u00a0km), the coast of Great Britain has a length of about 1,500\u00a0mi (2,400\u00a0km). Using an interval of 30\u00a0mi (50\u00a0km), the length is about 2,100\u00a0mi (3,400\u00a0km).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * Exclusive economic zone\n* Forest\n* Irrigated land\n* Organic farmland\n |\n| Continent | * Africa\n* Asia\n* Europe\n* North America\n* Oceania\n* South America\n |\n\n |\n| Extreme points | * Elevation\n\t+ average\n* Latitude\n\t+ Northernmost\n\t+ Southernmost\n* Longitude\n\t+ Easternmost\n\t+ Westernmost\n |\n| Perimeter | * Border/area ratio\n* Coastline length\n* Land borders\n* Land and maritime borders\n* Maritime boundaries\n* Political and geographic borders\n |\n| Others | * Freshwater\n\t+ resources\n\t+ withdrawal\n* Number of islands\n* Time zones\n |\n| * List of international rankings\n* Lists by country\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n11. **^** In 1900, the Dutch coastline measured approximately 1400 km.

It may include territories whose status have changed. According to their technical notes, the \"coastline length was derived from the World Vector Shoreline database at 1:250,000 scale. The estimates (...) were calculated using a Geographic Information System (GIS) and an underlying database consistent for the entire world. The methodology used to estimate length is based on the following: 1) A country's coastline is made up of individual lines, and an individual line has two or more vertices and/or nodes. 2) The length between two vertices is calculated on the surface of a sphere. 3) The sum of the lengths of the pairs of vertices is aggregated for each individual line, and 4) the sum of the lengths of individual lines was aggregated for a country. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Data marked The World Factbook or TWF covers 198 countries and 55 territories, from the book published by the Central Intelligence Agency. In addition to coastline lengths, this is the source of the land area used to calculate the \"coast/area ratio\" for both TWF and WRI (see below) coastline measurement. This ratio measures how many metres of coastline correspond to every square kilometer of land area. The ratio illustrates the ease of accessibility to the country's coast from every point in its interior. Therefore, an island country like Maldives, or a country carved by the sea like Greece, is more likely to have a high ratio, while a landlocked country will have a ratio of zero. Note that the scales at which The World Factbook figures were measured are not stated, nor is it known whether the figures are all reported using the same scale, thus the figures are not necessarily comparable across different countries.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| *![](image)\u00a0Norfolk Island* | \u2014 | 32 |  |  | 36 | 889 |  | 5.33\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Nauru | 150 | 30 |  |  | 21 | 1,430 |  | 6.55\n |\n| *![](image)\u00a0Bouvet Island* | \u2014 | 29.6 |  |  | 49 | 604 |  | 4.23\n |\n| *![](image)\u00a0Cocos (Keeling) Islands* | \u2014 | 26 |  |  | 14 | 1,860 |  | 6.95\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Jordan | 151 | 26[Note 16] | 147 | 27 | 88,802 | 0.293 | 0.304\n | 0.0872\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Tuvalu | 152 | 24 |  |  | 26 | 923 |  | 4.71\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Bosnia and Herzegovina | 153 | 20 | 148 | 23 | 51,187 | 0.391 | 0.449\n | 0.0884\n |\n| *![](image)\u00a0Wake Island* | \u2014 | 19.3 |  |  | 6.5 | 2,970 |  | 7.57\n |\n| *![](image)\u00a0Gibraltar* | \u2014 | 12 |  |  | 6.5 | 1,850 |  | 4.71\n |\n| *![](image)\u00a0Clipperton Island* | \u2014 | 11.1 |  |  | 6 | 1,850 |  | 4.53\n |\n| *![](image)\u00a0Navassa Island* | \u2014 | 8 |  |  | 5.4 | 1,480 |  | 3.44\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Monaco | 154 | 4.1 |  |  | 2 | 2,050 |  | 2.9\n |\n| *![](image)\u00a0Saint Barth\u00e9lemy* | \u2014 | NA |  |  | 25 |  |  |  |\n| *![](image)\u00a0Sint Maarten* | \u2014 | NA[Note 17] |  |  | 34 | 0.0147 |  |  |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| *![](image)\u00a0Tokelau* | \u2014 | 101 |  |  | 12 | 8,420 |  | 29.2\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Barbados | 139 | 97 | 143 | 97 | 430 | 226 | 226\n | 4.68\n |\n| *![](image)\u00a0Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha* | \u2014 | 94[Note 13] |  |  | 394 | 239 |  | 4.74\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Lithuania | 140 | 90 | 131 | 258 | 62,680 | 1.44 | 4.12\n | 0.359\n |\n| *![](image)\u00a0United States Pacific Island Wildlife Refuges*[Note 14] | \u2014 | 85.7 |  |  | 22.41 | 3,820 |  | 18.1\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Saint Vincent and the Grenadines | 141 | 84 | 130 | 264 | 389 | 216 | 679\n | 4.26\n |\n| *![](image)\u00a0Akrotiri and Dhekelia* | \u2014 | 83.8 |  |  | 253.8[4] | 330 |  | 5.26\n |\n| *![](image)\u00a0British Virgin Islands* | \u2014 | 80 |  |  | 151 | 530 |  | 6.51\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Gambia | 142 | 80 | 117 | 503 | 10,120 | 7.91 | 49.7\n | 0.795\n |\n| *![](image)\u00a0Ashmore and Cartier Islands* | \u2014 | 74.1 |  |  | 5 | 14,800 |  | 33.1\n |\n| *![](image)\u00a0Jersey* | \u2014 | 70 |  |  | 116 | 603 |  | 6.5\n |\n| *![](image)\u00a0Aruba* | \u2014 | 68.5 | \u2014 | 107 | 180 | 381 | 594\n | 5.11\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| ![](image)\u00a0Republic of China (Taiwan) | 62 | 1,566.3 | 74 | 2,007 | 32,260 | 48.6 | 62.2\n | 8.72\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Palau | 63 | 1,519 |  |  | 459 | 3,310 |  | 70.9\n |\n| *![](image)\u00a0Northern Mariana Islands* | \u2014 | 1,482 |  |  | 464 | 3,190 |  | 68.8\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Ireland | 64 | 1,448 | 38 | 6,437 | 68,883 | 21.0 | 93.4\n | 5.52\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Tanzania | 65 | 1,424 | 53 | 3,461 | 885,800 | 1.61 | 3.91\n | 1.51\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Sri Lanka | 66 | 1,340 | 64 | 2,825 | 64,630 | 20.7 | 43.7\n | 5.27\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0United Arab Emirates | 67 | 1,318 | 62 | 2,871 | 83,600 | 15.8 | 34.3\n | 4.56\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Costa Rica | 68 | 1,290 | 70 | 2,069 | 51,060 | 25.3 | 40.5\n | 5.71\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Dominican Republic | 69 | 1,288 | 88 | 1,612 | 48,320 | 26.7 | 33.4\n | 5.86\n |\n| *![](image)\u00a0Falkland Islands* | \u2014 | 1,288 |  |  | 12,173 | 106 |  | 11.7\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Finland | 70 | 1,250 | 10 | 31,119 | 303,815 | 4.11 | 102\n | 2.27\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Tunisia | 71 | 1,148 | 79 | 1,927 | 155,360 | 7.39 | 12.4\n | 2.91\n |\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

A coastline of zero indicates that the country is landlocked.\n\n\n\n\n## Overview[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nAn example of the coastline paradox. If measured using an interval of 125\u00a0mi (200\u00a0km), the coast of Great Britain has a length of about 1,500\u00a0mi (2,400\u00a0km). Using an interval of 30\u00a0mi (50\u00a0km), the length is about 2,100\u00a0mi (3,400\u00a0km).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| ![](image)\u00a0Vatican City | 155 | 0 |  |  | 0.44 | 0 |  |  |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Zambia | 155 | 0 | 149 | 0 | 743,398 | 0 | 0\n |  |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Zimbabwe | 155 | 0 | 149 | 0 | 386,847 | 0 | 0\n |  |\n| *![](image)\u00a0French Guiana* |  |  | \u2014 | 763 |  |  |  |  |\n| *![](image)\u00a0Guadeloupe* |  |  | \u2014 | 581 |  |  |  |  |\n| *![](image)\u00a0Martinique* |  |  | \u2014 | 369 |  |  |  |  |\n| *![](image)\u00a0Caribbean Netherlands* |  |  | \u2014 | 361 |  |  |  |  |\n| *![](image)\u00a0R\u00e9union* |  |  | \u2014 | 219 |  |  |  |  |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Coastal India\n* Coastline of Brazil\n* Coastline of China\n* Coastline of Malta\n* Coastline of New Zealand\n* Coastline of the United Kingdom\n* Coastline of Western Australia\n* List of countries bordering on two or more oceans\n* List of U.S. states by coastline\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n19. **^** Turkmenistan has a coastline with the Caspian Sea, which is landlocked, with a total length of 1,768 km.\n20. **^** Azerbaijan has a 713-km coastline along the Caspian Sea, which is landlocked.\n21. **^** The West Bank has a 40-km coastline along the Dead Sea, which is landlocked.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Coastal and Marine Ecosystems \u2014 Marine Jurisdictions: Coastline length\". *World Resources Institute*.

Coastline length for overseas territories and dependencies are listed separately.

It may include territories whose status have changed. According to their technical notes, the \"coastline length was derived from the World Vector Shoreline database at 1:250,000 scale. The estimates (...) were calculated using a Geographic Information System (GIS) and an underlying database consistent for the entire world. The methodology used to estimate length is based on the following: 1) A country's coastline is made up of individual lines, and an individual line has two or more vertices and/or nodes. 2) The length between two vertices is calculated on the surface of a sphere. 3) The sum of the lengths of the pairs of vertices is aggregated for each individual line, and 4) the sum of the lengths of individual lines was aggregated for a country. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * Exclusive economic zone\n* Forest\n* Irrigated land\n* Organic farmland\n |\n| Continent | * Africa\n* Asia\n* Europe\n* North America\n* Oceania\n* South America\n |\n\n |\n| Extreme points | * Elevation\n\t+ average\n* Latitude\n\t+ Northernmost\n\t+ Southernmost\n* Longitude\n\t+ Easternmost\n\t+ Westernmost\n |\n| Perimeter | * Border/area ratio\n* Coastline length\n* Land borders\n* Land and maritime borders\n* Maritime boundaries\n* Political and geographic borders\n |\n| Others | * Freshwater\n\t+ resources\n\t+ withdrawal\n* Number of islands\n* Time zones\n |\n| * List of international rankings\n* Lists by country\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Country\n | *The World Factbook*[2] | World Resources Institute[1] | Land area  km2 (*TWF*)[3] | Coast/area ratio (m/km2)\n | Coast/area0.5 ratio\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Rank\n | km\n | Rank\n | km\n | (*TWF*)\n | (WRI)\n | (TWF)\n |\n| *World*[Note 2] | \u2014 | 356,000 | \u2014 | 1,634,701 | 148,940,000 | 2.39 | 11.0\n | 29.2\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Canada | 1 | 202,080 | 1 | 265,523 | 9,093,507 | 22.2 | 29.2\n | 67\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Norway | 2 | 83,281[Note 3] | 7 | 53,199 | 304,282 | 274 | 175\n | 151\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Indonesia | 3 | 54,716 | 4 | 95,181 | 1,811,569 | 30.2 | 52.5\n | 40.7\n |\n| *![](image)\u00a0Greenland*[Note 4] | \u2014 | 44,087 |  |  | 2,166,086 | 20.4 |  | 30\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Russia | 4 | 37,653[Note 5] | 3 | 110,310 | 16,377,742 | 2.30 | 6.74\n | 9.3\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Philippines | 5 | 36,289 | 8 | 33,900 | 298,170 | 122 | 114\n | 66.5\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Japan | 6 | 29,751 | 12 | 29,020 | 364,485 | 81.6 | 79.6\n | 49.3\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Australia | 7 | 25,760 | 6 | 66,530 | 7,682,300 | 3.35 | 8.66\n | 9.29\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe coastline paradox states that a coastline does not have a well-defined length. Measurements of the length of a coastline behave like a fractal, being different at different scale intervals (distance between points on the coastline at which measurements are taken). The smaller the scale interval (meaning the more detailed the measurement), the longer the coastline will be.[Note 1] This \"magnifying\" effect is greater for convoluted coastlines than for relatively smooth ones.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Data marked The World Factbook or TWF covers 198 countries and 55 territories, from the book published by the Central Intelligence Agency. In addition to coastline lengths, this is the source of the land area used to calculate the \"coast/area ratio\" for both TWF and WRI (see below) coastline measurement. This ratio measures how many metres of coastline correspond to every square kilometer of land area. The ratio illustrates the ease of accessibility to the country's coast from every point in its interior. Therefore, an island country like Maldives, or a country carved by the sea like Greece, is more likely to have a high ratio, while a landlocked country will have a ratio of zero. Note that the scales at which The World Factbook figures were measured are not stated, nor is it known whether the figures are all reported using the same scale, thus the figures are not necessarily comparable across different countries.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | 18.4\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Cuba | 31 | 3,735 | 21 | 14,519 | 109,820 | 34.0 | 132\n | 11.3\n |\n| *![](image)\u00a0Svalbard* | \u2014 | 3,587 |  |  | 62,045 | 57.8 |  | 14.4\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Bahamas, The | 32 | 3,542 | 24 | 11,238 | 10,010 | 354 | 1,120\n | 35.4\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Vietnam | 33 | 3,444[Note 7] | 23 | 11,409 | 310,070 | 11.1 | 36.8\n | 6.18\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Somalia | 34 | 3,333 | 50 | 3,898 | 627,337 | 4.82 | 6.21\n | 4.21\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Thailand | 35 | 3,219 | 35 | 7,066 | 510,890 | 6.30 | 13.8\n | 4.5\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Sweden | 36 | 3,218 | 13 | 26,384 | 410,335 | 7.84 | 64.3\n | 5.02\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Colombia | 37 | 3,208 | 41 | 5,875 | 1,038,700 | 3.09 | 5.66\n | 3.15\n |\n| *![](image)\u00a0Coral Sea Islands* | \u2014 | 3,095 |  |  | <3 | >1,000,000 |  |  |\n| *![](image)\u00a0French Southern and Antarctic Lands* | \u2014 | 2,948.4[Note 8] |  |  | 7,667.6 | 385 |  | 33.7\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Morocco | 38 | 2,945 | 73 | 2,009 | 716,550 | 2.56 | 2.80\n | 3.48\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Venezuela | 39 | 2,800 | 37 | 6,762 | 882,050 | 3.17 | 7.67\n | 2.98\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| *![](image)\u00a0Norfolk Island* | \u2014 | 32 |  |  | 36 | 889 |  | 5.33\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Nauru | 150 | 30 |  |  | 21 | 1,430 |  | 6.55\n |\n| *![](image)\u00a0Bouvet Island* | \u2014 | 29.6 |  |  | 49 | 604 |  | 4.23\n |\n| *![](image)\u00a0Cocos (Keeling) Islands* | \u2014 | 26 |  |  | 14 | 1,860 |  | 6.95\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Jordan | 151 | 26[Note 16] | 147 | 27 | 88,802 | 0.293 | 0.304\n | 0.0872\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Tuvalu | 152 | 24 |  |  | 26 | 923 |  | 4.71\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Bosnia and Herzegovina | 153 | 20 | 148 | 23 | 51,187 | 0.391 | 0.449\n | 0.0884\n |\n| *![](image)\u00a0Wake Island* | \u2014 | 19.3 |  |  | 6.5 | 2,970 |  | 7.57\n |\n| *![](image)\u00a0Gibraltar* | \u2014 | 12 |  |  | 6.5 | 1,850 |  | 4.71\n |\n| *![](image)\u00a0Clipperton Island* | \u2014 | 11.1 |  |  | 6 | 1,850 |  | 4.53\n |\n| *![](image)\u00a0Navassa Island* | \u2014 | 8 |  |  | 5.4 | 1,480 |  | 3.44\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Monaco | 154 | 4.1 |  |  | 2 | 2,050 |  | 2.9\n |\n| *![](image)\u00a0Saint Barth\u00e9lemy* | \u2014 | NA |  |  | 25 |  |  |  |\n| *![](image)\u00a0Sint Maarten* | \u2014 | NA[Note 17] |  |  | 34 | 0.0147 |  |  |\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
