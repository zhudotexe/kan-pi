It was built in four stages: stage I (1957\u20131959) was planning out the building; stage II (1959\u20131963) consisted of building the upper podium; stage III (1963\u20131967) the construction of the outer shells; stage IV (1967\u20131973) interior design and construction.\n\n\n\n#### Stage I: Podium[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Sydney Opera House |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)50th anniversary logo\n |\n| ![](image)View from the west\n |\n| ![Sydney Opera House is located in Sydney](image)![Sydney Opera House](image)\nLocation in Sydney\nShow map of Sydney\n![Sydney Opera House is located in New South Wales](image)![Sydney Opera House](image)\nLocation in New South Wales\nShow map of New South Wales\n![Sydney Opera House is located in Australia](image)![Sydney Opera House](image)\nLocation in Australia\nShow map of Australia\n |\n| General information |\n| Status | Completed |\n| Type | Performing arts centre |\n| Architectural style | Expressionist |\n| Location | Bennelong Point, Sydney |\n| Country | Australia |\n| Coordinates | 33\u00b051\u203231\u2033S 151\u00b012\u203251\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff33.85861\u00b0S 151.21417\u00b0E\ufeff / -33.85861; 151.21417 |\n| Elevation | 4\u00a0m (13\u00a0ft) |\n| Current tenants | * Opera Australia\n* The Australian Ballet\n* Sydney Theatre Company\n* Sydney Symphony Orchestra\n* (+ others)\n |\n| Groundbreaking | 1\u00a0March 1959; 65 years ago\u00a0(1959-03-01) |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)The steps of the Opera House\nThe Sydney Opera House was formally opened by Queen Elizabeth II, on 20 October 1973. A large crowd attended. The opening was televised and included fireworks and a performance of Beethoven's Symphony No. 9.[63]\n\n\n\n### Reconciliation with Utzon; building refurbishment[edit]\n\n\nIn the late 1990s, the Sydney Opera House Trust resumed communication with Utzon in an attempt to effect a reconciliation and to secure his involvement in future changes to the building. In 1999, he was appointed by the trust as a design consultant for future work.[64]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)The building illuminated at night\nBefore the Sydney Opera House competition, J\u00f8rn Utzon had won seven of the 18 competitions he had entered but had never seen any of his designs built.[54] Utzon's submitted concept for the Sydney Opera House was almost universally admired and considered groundbreaking. The Assessors Report of January 1957 stated:\n\n\n\n\n> The drawings submitted for this scheme are simple to the point of being diagrammatic. Nevertheless, as we have returned again and again to the study of these drawings, we are convinced that they present a concept of an Opera House which is capable of becoming one of the great buildings of the world.\n> \n> \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Inflation Calculator\".

The design was one of the first examples of the use of computer-aided design to design complex shapes. The design techniques developed by Utzon and Arup for the Sydney Opera House have been further developed and are now used for architecture, such as works of Gehry and blobitecture, as well as most reinforced concrete structures. The design is also one of the first in the world to use araldite to glue the precast structural elements together and proved the concept for future use.\n\n\nIt was also a first in mechanical engineering. Another Danish firm, Steensen Varming, was responsible for designing the new air-conditioning plant, the largest in Australia at the time, supplying over 600,000 cubic feet (17,000\u00a0m3) of air per minute,[61] using the innovative idea of harnessing the harbour water to create a water-cooled heat pump system that is still in operation today.[62]\n\n\n\n### Opening[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n25. **^** \"Sydney Architecture Images- Sydney Opera House\".

The architectural work was divided between three appointees who became the Hall, Todd, Littlemore partnership. David Littlemore would manage construction supervision, Lionel Todd contract documentation, while the crucial role of design became the responsibility of Peter Hall.[71]:\u200a45\n\n\nHall completed a combined arts and architecture degree at Sydney University. Upon graduation a travel scholarship enabled him to spend twelve months in Europe during which time he visited Utzon in Helleb\u00e6k.[72] Returning to Sydney, Hall worked for the Government Architect, a branch of the NSW Public Works Department. While there he established himself as a talented design architect with a number of court and university buildings, including the Goldstein Hall at the University of New South Wales, which won the Sir John Sulman Medal in 1964.\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

It was commissioned in 1631 by the fifth Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan (r.\u20091628\u20131658) to house the tomb of his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAnother such unsupported theory is that the Taj Mahal was designed by an Italian, Geronimo Vereneo, held sway for a brief period after it was first promoted by Henry George Keene in 1879 who went by a translation of a Spanish work *Itinerario*, (*The Travels of Fray Sebastian Manrique, 1629\u20131643*). Another theory that a Frenchman, Austin of Bordeaux designed the Taj was promoted by William Henry Sleeman based on the work of Jean-Baptiste Tavernier. These ideas were revived by Father Hosten and discussed again by E.B. Havell and served as the basis for subsequent theories and controversies.[101]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe outlying buildings were completed in 1643.[17]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nTaj Mahal and outlying buildings as seen from across the Yamuna River (northern view)\n\n## Construction[edit]\n\n\nThe Taj Mahal is built on a parcel of land to the south of the walled city of Agra. Shah Jahan presented Maharaja Jai Singh I with a large palace in the centre of Agra in exchange for the land.[46] An area of roughly 1.2 hectares (3 acres) was excavated, filled with dirt to reduce seepage, and levelled at 50 metres (160\u00a0ft) above the riverbank level. In the tomb area, piles were dug and filled with stone and rubble to form the footings of the tomb. Instead of lashed bamboo, workmen constructed a colossal brick scaffold that mirrored the tomb. The scaffold was so enormous that foremen expected it to take years to dismantle.[47]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n19. **^** Wayne Edison Begley; Ziauddin Abdul Hayy Desai (1989). *Taj Mahal: The Illumined Tomb\u00a0: an Anthology of Seventeenth-century Mughal and European Documentary Sources*.

For instance, in 2000, India's Supreme Court dismissed P. N. Oak's petition[98] to declare that a Hindu king built the Taj Mahal.[95][99] In 2005, a similar petition was dismissed by the Allahabad High Court.

The plan has been split into two\u00a0\u2013 one half is the white marble mausoleum itself and the gardens, and the other half is the red sandstone side meant for worldly markets. Only the mausoleum is white so as to represent the enlightenment, spirituality and faith of Mumtaz Mahal. According to the world-traveler Eleanor Roosevelt, the white symbolised the purity of real love.[59] Koch has deciphered that symbolic of Islamic teachings, the plan of the worldly side is a mirror image of the otherworldly side, and the grand gate in the middle represents the transition between the two worlds.\n\n\nThe Taj is also seen as a feminine architectural form, and is thought to embody Mumtaz Mahal herself.[60]\n\n\n\n## Later days[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nA dark reflection of the white mausoleum could clearly be seen, befitting Shah Jahan's obsession with symmetry and the positioning of the pool itself.[92]\n\n\nNo concrete evidence exists for claims that describe, often in horrific detail, the deaths, dismemberments and mutilations which Shah Jahan supposedly inflicted on various architects and craftsmen associated with the tomb.[93][94] Some stories claim that those involved in construction signed contracts committing themselves to have no part in any similar design. Similar claims are made for many famous buildings.[95] No evidence exists for claims that Lord William Bentinck, governor-general of India in the 1830s, supposedly planned to demolish the Taj Mahal and auction off the marble. Bentinck's biographer John Rosselli says that the story arose from Bentinck's fund-raising sale of discarded marble from Agra Fort.[96]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe exterior decorations of the Taj Mahal are among the finest in Mughal architecture. As the surface area changes, the decorations are refined proportionally. The decorative elements were created by applying paint, stucco, stone inlays or carvings. In line with the Islamic prohibition against the use of anthropomorphic forms, the decorative elements can be grouped into either calligraphy, abstract forms or vegetative motifs.\nThroughout the complex are passages from the Qur'an that comprise some of the decorative elements. Recent scholarship suggests that Amanat Khan chose the passages.[30][31]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being \"the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage\". It is regarded by many as the best example of Mughal architecture and a symbol of India's rich history. The Taj Mahal attracts 7-8\u00a0million visitors a year,[8] and in 2007 it was declared a winner of the New 7 Wonders of the World (2000\u20132007) initiative.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nAbdul Hamid Lahori, in his book from 1636 *Padshahnama*, refers to the Taj Mahal as *rauza-i munawwara* (Perso-Arabic: \u0631\u0648\u0636\u0647 \u0645\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0631\u0647, *rawdah-i munawwarah*), meaning the illumined or illustrious tomb.[9]\nThe current name for the Taj Mahal is of Urdu origin, and believed to be derived from Arabic and Persian, with the words *t\u0101j mahall* meaning \"crown\" (*t\u0101j*) \"palace\" (*mahall*).[10][11][4] The name \"Taj\" came from the corruption of the second syllable of \"Mumtaz\".[12][13]\n\n\n\n## Inspiration[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Taj Mahal was commissioned by Shah Jahan in 1631, to be built in the memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal, who died on 17 June that year, while giving birth to their 14th child, Gauhara Begum.[14][15] Construction started in 1632,[16] and the mausoleum was completed in 1648, while the surrounding buildings and garden were finished five years later.[17] The imperial court documenting Shah Jahan's grief after the death of Mumtaz Mahal illustrates the love story held as the inspiration for the Taj Mahal.[18] According to contemporary historians Muhammad Amin Qazvini, Abdul Hamid Lahori and Muhammad Saleh Kamboh, he did not show the same level of affection to others as he had shown her while she was alive. He avoided royal affairs for a week due to his grief, along with giving up listening to music and dressing lavishly for two years. Shah Jahan was enamored by the beauty of the land at the south side of Agra on which a mansion belonging to Raja Jai Singh I stood. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn the lower walls of the tomb are white marble dados sculpted with realistic bas relief depictions of flowers and vines. The marble has been polished to emphasise the exquisite detailing of the carvings. The dado frames and archway spandrels have been decorated with pietra dura inlays of highly stylised, almost geometric vines, flowers and fruits. The inlay stones are of yellow marble, jasper and jade, polished and levelled to the surface of the walls.[32]\n\n\n\nDetailed exterior design\n* ![Taj Mahal Exterior with a minaret](image)\n\nTaj Mahal Exterior with a minaret\n* ![Detail of plant motifs on Taj Mahal wall](image)\n\nDetail of plant motifs on Taj Mahal wall\n* ![Base, dome and minaret](image)\n\nBase, dome and minaret\n* ![Finial, tamga of the Mughal Empire](image)\n\nFinial, tamga of the Mughal Empire\n* ![Plant motifs](image)\n\nPlant motifs\n* ![Reflective tiles](image)\n\nReflective tiles\n* ![Marble jali (latticed grill)](image)\n\nMarble jali (latticed grill)\n* ![Calligraphy of Arabic Ayaat](image)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nConstruction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but work continued on other phases of the project for another 10 years. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around \u20b932\u00a0million, which in 2023 would be approximately \u20b935\u00a0billion.[7] The construction project employed some 20,000 artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by Ustad Ahmad Lahori, the emperor's court architect. Various types of symbolism have been employed in the Taj to reflect natural beauty and divinity.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs of 2017, several court cases about Taj Mahal being a Hindu temple have been inspired by P. N. Oak's theory.[102][103] In August 2017, Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) stated there was no evidence to suggest the monument ever housed a temple.[104] Bharatiya Janata Party's Vinay Katiyar in 2017 claimed that the 17th century monument was built by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan after destroying a Hindu temple called \"Tejo Mahalaya\" and it housed a Shiva linga. This claim had also been made by another BJP member Laxmikant Bajpai in 2014. The BJP government's Union Minister of Culture Mahesh Sharma stated in November 2015 during a session of the parliament, that there was no evidence that it was a temple. The theories about Taj Mahal being a Shiva temple started circulating when Oak released his 1989 book *Taj Mahal: The True Story*. He claimed it was built in 1155 AD and not in the 17th century, as stated by the ASI.[105]\n\n\n\n## Gallery[edit]\n\n\n* Taj Mahal\n* ![Eastern view in the morning](image)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe interior chamber of the Taj Mahal reaches far beyond traditional decorative elements. The inlay work is not pietra dura, but a lapidary of precious and semiprecious gemstones.[35] The inner chamber is an octagon with the design allowing for entry from each face, although only the door facing the garden to the south is used. The interior walls are about 25 metres (82\u00a0ft) high and are topped by a \"false\" interior dome decorated with a sun motif. Eight pishtaq arches define the space at ground level and, as with the exterior, each lower pishtaq is crowned by a second pishtaq about midway up the wall.[36] The four central upper arches form balconies or viewing areas, and each balcony's exterior window has an intricate screen or *jali* a grill lattice cut from marble. In addition to the light from the balcony screens, light enters through roof openings covered by chattris at the corners. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThey changed the landscaping to their liking which more closely resembled the formal lawns of London.[45]\n\n\n\n### Outlying buildings[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The western building, a mosque, faces the tomb.\nThe Taj Mahal complex is bordered on three sides by crenellated red sandstone walls; the side facing the river is open. Outside the walls are several additional mausoleums, including those of Shah Jahan's other wives, and a larger tomb for Mumtaz's favourite servant.[*citation needed*] These structures, composed primarily of red sandstone, are typical of the smaller Mughal tombs of the era. The garden-facing inner sides of the wall are fronted by columned arcades, a feature typical of Hindu temples which was later incorporated into Mughal mosques. The wall is interspersed with domed *chattris*, and small buildings that may have been viewing areas or watch towers like the Music House, which is now used as a museum.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAnimation showing the Taj Mahal (English subtitles)\nThe Taj Mahal incorporates and expands on design traditions of Indo-Islamic and earlier Mughal architecture. Specific inspiration came from successful Timurid and Mughal buildings including the Gur-e Amir (the tomb of Timur, progenitor of the Mughal dynasty, in Samarkand),[20] Humayun's Tomb which inspired the Charbagh gardens and hasht-behesht (architecture) plan of the site, Itmad-Ud-Daulah's Tomb (sometimes called the *Baby Taj*), and Shah Jahan's own Jama Masjid in Delhi. While earlier Mughal buildings were primarily constructed of red sandstone, Shah Jahan promoted the use of white marble inlaid with semi-precious stones. Buildings under his patronage reached new levels of refinement.[21]\n\n\n\n### Tomb[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n8. **^** \"Views of Taj Mahal\". *www.tajmahal.gov.in*.

The first through 85th floors contain 2.158\u00a0million square feet (200,500\u00a0m2) of commercial and office space, while the 86th floor contains an observatory.[33][31][34] The remaining 16 stories are part of the spire, which is capped by an observatory on the 102nd floor; the spire does not contain any intermediate levels and is used mostly for mechanical purposes.[31] Atop the 102nd story is the 203\u00a0ft (61.9\u00a0m) pinnacle, much of which is covered by broadcast antennas, and surmounted with a lightning rod.[35]\n\n\n\n### Form[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Rasenberger, Jim (2009). *High Steel: The Daring Men Who Built the World's Greatest Skyline, 1881 to the Present*.

The most important buildings visible on the Acropolis today \u2013 the Parthenon, the Propylaia, the Erechtheion and the temple of Athena Nike \u2013 were erected during this period. The Parthenon was built under the general supervision of Phidias, who also had charge of the sculptural decoration. The architects Ictinos and Callicrates began their work in 447, and the building was substantially completed by 432. Work on the decorations continued until at least 431.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)The Doric order of the Parthenon\nAlthough the Parthenon is architecturally a temple and is usually called so, some scholars have argued that it is not really a temple in the conventional sense of the word.[30] A small shrine has been excavated within the building, on the site of an older sanctuary probably dedicated to Athena as a way to get closer to the goddess,[30] but the Parthenon apparently never hosted the official cult of Athena Polias, patron of Athens. The cult image of Athena Polias, which was bathed in the sea and to which was presented the *peplos*, was an olive-wood *xoanon*, located in another temple on the northern side of the Acropolis, more closely associated with the Great Altar of Athena.[31] The High Priestess of Athena Polias supervised the city cult of Athena based in the Akropolis, and was the chief of the lesser officials, such as the plyntrides, arrephoroi and kanephoroi.[32]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n6. **^** Barletta, Barbara A.

It stands on a platform or stylobate of three steps. In common with other Greek temples, it is of post and lintel construction and is surrounded by columns ('peripteral') carrying an entablature. There are eight columns at either end ('octastyle') and seventeen on the sides. There is a double row of columns at either end. The colonnade surrounds an inner masonry structure, the *cella,* which is divided into two compartments. The *opisthodomos* (the back room of the cella) contained the monetary contributions of the Delian League. At either end of the building, the gable is finished with a triangular pediment originally occupied by sculpted figures.[63]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Parthenon has been described as \"the culmination of the development of the Doric order\".[64] The Doric columns, for example, have simple capitals, fluted shafts, and no bases. Above the architrave of the entablature is a frieze of carved pictorial panels (metopes), separated by formal architectural triglyphs, also typical of the Doric order. The continuous frieze in low relief around the cella and across the lintels of the inner columns, in contrast, reflects the Ionic order. Architectural historian John R. Senseney suggests that this unexpected switch between orders was due to an aesthetic choice on the part of builders during construction, and was likely not part of the original plan of the Parthenon.[65]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe **Parthenon** (/\u02c8p\u0251\u02d0r\u03b8\u0259\u02ccn\u0252n, -n\u0259n/; Ancient Greek: \u03a0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b8\u03b5\u03bd\u03ce\u03bd, romanized:\u00a0**Parthen\u014dn** [par.t\u02b0e.n\u0254\u030c\u02d0n]; Greek: \u03a0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b8\u03b5\u03bd\u03ce\u03bd\u03b1\u03c2, romanized:\u00a0*Parthen\u00f3nas* [par\u03b8e\u02c8nonas]) is a former temple[6][7] on the Athenian Acropolis, Greece, that was dedicated to the goddess Athena during the fifth century BC. Its decorative sculptures are considered some of the high points of classical Greek art, an enduring symbol of Ancient Greece, democracy and Western civilization.[8][9]\n\n\nThe Parthenon was built in thanksgiving for the Hellenic victory over Persian Empire invaders during the Greco-Persian Wars.[10] Like most Greek temples, the Parthenon also served as the city treasury.[11][12]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 5th-century BC accounts of the building, the structure is simply called \u1f41 \u03bd\u1fb1\u03cc\u03c2 (*ho naos*; lit. \"the temple\"). Douglas Frame writes that the name \"Parthenon\" was a nickname related to the statue of Athena Parthenos, and only appeared a century after construction. He contends that \"Athena's temple was never officially called the Parthenon and she herself most likely never had the cult title *parth\u00e9nos*\".[22] The ancient architects Iktinos and Callicrates appear to have called the building \u1f19\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03cc\u03bc\u03c0\u03b5\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2 (*Hekat\u00f3mpedos*; lit. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nTemple on the Athenian Acropolis, Greece\n\n\"Temple of Athena\" redirects here.

John Julius Cooper wrote that \"even in antiquity, its architectural refinements were legendary, especially the subtle correspondence between the curvature of the stylobate, the taper of the naos walls, and the entasis of the columns\".[68] Entasis refers to the slight swelling, of 4 centimetres (1.6\u00a0in), in the center of the columns to counteract the appearance of columns having a waist, as the swelling makes them look straight from a distance. The stylobate is the platform on which the columns stand. As in many other classical Greek temples,[69] it has a slight parabolic upward curvature intended to shed rainwater and reinforce the building against earthquakes. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDespite the alterations accompanying the Parthenon's conversion into a church and subsequently a mosque, its structure had remained basically intact.[121] In 1667, the Turkish traveller Evliya \u00c7elebi expressed marvel at the Parthenon's sculptures and figuratively described the building as \"like some impregnable fortress not made by human agency\".[122] He composed a poetic supplication stating that, as \"a work less of human hands than of Heaven itself, [it] should remain standing for all time\".[123] The French artist Jacques Carrey in 1674 visited the Acropolis and sketched the Parthenon's sculptural decorations.[124] Early in 1687, an engineer named Plantier sketched the Parthenon for the Frenchman Graviers d'Orti\u00e8res.[100] These depictions, particularly Carrey's, provide important, and sometimes the only, evidence of the condition of the Parthenon and its various sculptures prior to the devastation it suffered in late 1687 and the subsequent looting of its art objects.[124]\n\n\n\n### Destruction[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Parthenon Archived 5 March 2011 at the Wayback Machine.
