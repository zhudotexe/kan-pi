Registered Democrats hold a formidable 7-to-1 ratio over registered Republicans in Philadelphia, giving Democratic candidates a distinct advantage in citywide elections. The mayoral primary elections were held on May 19, 2015. Kenney won the primary in a landslide with 55.83% of the vote, defeating a crowded field of five other Democratic candidates, including Anthony H. Williams and former District Attorney Lynn Abraham. Republican Melissa Murray Bailey, a business executive, ran unopposed for the Republican nomination. Kenney won with 85.1% of the vote.[12] Kenney was inaugurated as the 99th Mayor of Philadelphia on January 4, 2016.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMayor of Philadelphia since 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Jim Kenney\n |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) |\n|  |\n| 99th Mayor of Philadelphia |\n| **Incumbent**\n |\n| **Assumed office** January 4, 2016 |\n| Preceded by | Michael Nutter |\n| Member of the Philadelphia City Councilfrom the at-large district |\n| **In office**January 6, 1992 – January 29, 2015 |\n| Preceded by | George Burrell |\n|  |\n| Personal details |\n| Born | James Francis Kenney\n (1958-08-07) August 7, 1958 (age 65)Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S. |\n| Political party | Democratic |\n| Education | La Salle University (BA) |\n| Website | Campaign website |\n|  |\n\n\n**James Francis Kenney** (born August 7, 1958) is an American politician who is the 99th Mayor of Philadelphia.

The only exemption being if the individual is being released following a first or second degree felony conviction and federal officials obtain a warrant from a judge[37][38] - effectively making Philadelphia a sanctuary city.[39][40] Nutter indicated that the change in policy supports public safety and will help rebuild the trust between police and the immigrant community.[38] The executive order was highlighted in June 2014 after a previously deported undocumented immigrant from Honduras was accused of raping a woman in Rittenhouse Square with the concern that if acquitted, the accused would not be submitted for deportation due to Philadelphia's new policy.[41][42][43]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of mayors of the largest 50 US cities\n* History of African Americans in Philadelphia\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_vJRx8n7YTAKuwSFIhkXQiKsc","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

The current mayor of Philadelphia is Jim Kenney, whose term as mayor expires in 2024.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### 18th century[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe first mayor of Philadelphia was Humphrey Morrey, who was appointed to the position by William Penn, the founder of the city and the colonial-era Province of Pennsylvania, which became the state of Pennsylvania following the American Revolutionary War. Penn subsequently appointed Edward Shippen under the city charter of 1701. The Philadelphia City Council then elected Shippen to a second term. Subsequent mayors, who held office for one year, were elected by the Philadelphia City Council. The initial mayors of Philadelphia were not compensated and candidates sometimes objected strongly to being selected to the position, sometimes choosing even to pay a fine rather than serve in the position.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe restriction was lifted in the 1940s allowing Bernard Samuel to run for re-election. In 1951, the city's Home Rule Charter established a two-term limit for mayors.[4] The term limit is consecutive, not lifetime. \n\n\nThe mayorship of Philadelphia has been held by Democrats since 1952. The only Republican who has come close to winning the position was Sam Katz, who in 1999 came within half a percentage point of being the first Republican mayor of Philadelphia elected in over 45 years.\n\n\n\n## List of Mayors[edit]\n\n\nParties\n  Democratic (16) \n  Democratic-Republican (4) \n  Federalist (6) \n  Keystone (1) \n  National Republican (2) \n  Republican (19) \n  Whig (5) \n\n\n\n### Colonial mayors elected by the Common Council[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nMayors of Philadelphia (chronologically)\n |\n| --- |\n| Colonial era(1691–1776) | * Morrey\n* Shippen (I)\n* Morris (I)\n* G.

When he could not be located after three days, a new election had to be arranged, and Attwood was re-elected to a second term.\n\n\n\n### 19th century[edit]\n\n\nBeginning in 1826, Council could elect any citizen of Philadelphia to the mayoralty. From 1839, mayors were elected by popular vote. If no candidate won a majority of the popular vote, then the joint Councils (Select and Common) would decide between the two leading candidates. John Swift was the first mayor to be elected directly by the people in the 1840 election.\n\n\nThe term of office was extended to two years in 1854, three years in 1861, and four years in 1885. Further, The Act of 1885 prohibited mayors from succeeding themselves.[4]\n\n\n\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 96 |  | ![](image) | Ed Rendell | January 6, 1992 | January 1, 1996 | Democratic | 122 | 187\n |\n| January 1, 1996 | January 3, 2000 | 188\n |\n| 97 |  | ![](image) | John F.

Robert Wharton declined in 1800 and 1811, amid serving for 14 one-year terms, making him the most-often-elected (16 times, including refusals) and longest-serving (14 years) mayor of Philadelphia.[3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 59 |  | Benjamin W.

His parents were Jewish, and all four of his grandparents were immigrants from Russia.[4] He attended Riverdale Country School before the University of Pennsylvania, where he joined the Pi Lambda Phi fraternity[5] in 1962 and earned a BA degree in 1965. In 1968, he earned a JD at Villanova University School of Law. He served as a 2nd Lieutenant in the U.S. Army Reserve from 1968 to 1974.\n\n\n\n## District attorney[edit]\n\n\nRendell was elected district attorney of Philadelphia in 1977, becoming the youngest[6] DA in history, after he defeated the incumbent Democratic district attorney, Emmett Fitzpatrick, in the primary election. Rendell ran a campaign that emphasized that he was new to politics and so was not tainted by its corruption.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n10. **^** Mahtesian, Charles (18 October 2012). \"Rendell: Casey hasn't run a campaign\". *POLITICO*.

The author was given practically unlimited access to the mayor during that term. *The New York Times* called Rendell's job as mayor \"the most stunning turnaround in recent urban history\" due to his determination, inspiration, ambition, and his energy.[15]\n\n\nIn 1996, Rendell signed an executive order, 2-96, which allowed same-sex couples of Philadelphia health benefits.[16][17]\n\n\nTo date, Rendell is the last Philadelphia Mayor to not have previously served as member of Philadelphia City Council.\n\n\n\n## 2002 gubernatorial campaign[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2002 Pennsylvania gubernatorial election\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nElected Mayor of Philadelphia in 1991, he inherited a $250 million deficit and the lowest credit rating of any major city in the country. As mayor, he balanced Philadelphia's budget and generated a budget surplus while cutting business and wage taxes and dramatically improving services to Philadelphia neighborhoods. *The New York Times* stated that Philadelphia under Rendell \"has made one of the most stunning turnarounds in recent urban history.\"[2] Nicknamed \"America's Mayor\" by Al Gore,[3] Rendell served as Chairman of the Democratic National Committee during the 2000 presidential election.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs district attorney, Rendell reportedly[7] had a mean temper while doing his job. Once, he yelled in the governor's face for releasing a certain prisoner. It has been said that Rendell would even punch walls or throw furniture when he became upset. In 1980, Rendell received 28 delegate votes for Vice President[8] at the Democratic National Convention, although he was not a candidate. He served two terms as DA before leaving in 1986 to run for Governor of Pennsylvania.[9] He was defeated in the Democratic gubernatorial primary by Bob Casey, Sr.[10]\n\n\nIn 1982, during his second term, Rendell presided over the controversial prosecution of Mumia Abu-Jamal, resulting in a death sentence that was overturned in 2011. The 1985 bombing of the Black religious community MOVE by the Philadelphia police also occurred during Rendell's tenure and killed 6 adults plus 5 children and caused a fire that left hundreds of neighbors homeless.[11]\n\n\n\n## Mayor of Philadelphia[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Rendell as mayor\nIn 1987, Rendell ran for the Democratic nomination against the incumbent mayor, Wilson Goode and lost. Rendell ran successfully four years later, in 1991. His opponent was to be Democrat-turned-Republican former Philadelphia Mayor, Frank Rizzo. Rizzo, however, died in the summer of 1991; in November 1991, Rendell won by more than a 2-1 margin against Joseph M. Egan, Jr., Rizzo's replacement on the Republican ticket.[12]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBorn in New York City to a Jewish family from Russia, Rendell moved to Philadelphia for college, completing his B.A. from the University of Pennsylvania and J.D. from Villanova University School of Law. He was elected District Attorney of Philadelphia for two terms from 1978 to 1986. He developed a reputation for being tough on crime,[1] fueling a run for Governor of Pennsylvania in 1986, which Rendell lost in the primary.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs mayor, Rendell inherited massive fiscal problems. The state legislature established a fiscal oversight board to monitor the City of Philadelphia's fiscal issues. During his career as mayor, Rendell cut a $250 million deficit, balanced Philadelphia's budget and oversaw five consecutive years of budget surpluses, reduced business and wage taxes for four consecutive years, implemented new revenue-generating initiatives, and dramatically improved services to Philadelphia neighborhoods. He was given the nickname \"Philadelphia's Renaissance or Revival\" because of how well he did with the budget.[13] He also appointed Philadelphia's first ever Latino deputy mayors, Benjamin Ramos and Manuel Ortiz. Rendell's cost-cutting policies brought him strong opposition from labor unions; however, he was re-elected in 1995, defeating Republican Joe Rocks with 80% of the vote.[14]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2002, Rendell was elected Governor of Pennsylvania. He was a member of the Democratic Governors Association Executive Committee and served as the Chairman of the National Governors Association. He was reelected in a landslide in 2006. He left office in 2011 due to term limits, and released a book, *A Nation of Wusses: How America's Leaders Lost the Guts to Make Us Great* the following year. A Philadelphia Eagles fan, Rendell is also a football analyst on NBC Sports Philadelphia's Eagles Postgame Live, hosted by Michael Barkann.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the November 2002 gubernatorial election, he defeated Republican State Attorney General Mike Fisher, garnering 53 percent of the vote to Fisher's 44 percent.[19] Rendell won not only Philadelphia County, which is heavily Democratic, but also traditionally Republican suburbs of Philadelphia,[20] largely due to his popularity as mayor of Philadelphia. These traditionally Republican voters who backed Rendell were called *Rendellicans* in other parts of the state and were a key part of the success of his campaign.[21]\n\n\nIn a 2002 PoliticsPA feature story designating politicians with yearbook superlatives, he was named the \"Most Likely to Succeed.\"[22] His campaign website was described as having \"cutting edge in design for a political site.\"[23]\n\n\n\n## Governor of Pennsylvania (2003–2011)[edit]\n\n\n### First term[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMarjorie Rendell is a Federal judge for the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit who was appointed by President Bill Clinton.

During his tenure as Mayor of Philadelphia, he appeared in the 1993 film Philadelphia as himself. He also played the Philadelphia Mayor in the 2015 film *The Benefactor* and the 2019 film *In the Shadow of the Moon* (Although out of office in real life this time for both of these movies).\n\n\n\n### Sports fan[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Rendell signing his book in 2012\n![](image)Rendell with Governors Tom Corbett, Tom Wolf, Tom Ridge, and Mark Schweiker in 2015\n![](image)Rendell and Governor Tom Wolf in 2019\nRendell was term-limited for the election of 2010.

Jackson, regarding a Texas water contamination case; and has been a vocal proponent of shale gas extraction as part of a United States energy strategy.[62][63] Rendell is a faculty member of the Fels Institute of Government at the University of Pennsylvania, and chair of Team Pennsylvania Foundation.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn 2016, Rendell admitted that during his term as Governor of Pennsylvania, he underperformed when he dealt with the growing popularity of shale gas in Pennsylvania.[64] Rendell stated, \"I made a mistake in the rush to get the economic part of fracking delivered to Pennsylvania\" saying that he should have been more concerned with the effect shale gas has on Pennsylvania's environment and not with how Pennsylvania could benefit financially from shale gas.[64]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn early 2005, Rendell made statements that seemed to support President George W. Bush's Social Security privatization proposal. Rendell addressed this issue in later speeches, saying that he opposes social security privatization, and that his previous comments were meant to show admiration for President Bush for taking on a politically risky subject. Nevertheless, Rendell's initial statements cost him support among Democrats who are against Social Security privatization.\n\n\nIn the early morning hours of July 7, 2005, Ed Rendell signed a bill into law that increased pay for state lawmakers, judges, and top executive-branch officials. The vote took place at 2 am without public review or commentary. On November 16, 2005, Rendell signed a repeal of the pay raise after a near unanimous vote for repeal.[34]\n\n\n\n### 2006 reelection campaign[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rendell and lieutenant governor Knoll after their 2006 reelection win\nMain article: 2006 Pennsylvania gubernatorial election\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n63. **^** \"Governor Ed Rendell Talks Fracking\". *HuffPost Live*.
