The ranking was based upon assets as reported and was not adjusted for different accounting treatments.[2] Another publication which has the goal to compile a yearly list of the world largest banks is The Banker Magazine. Every year in their July number a list of the World 1000 Largest Banks is published.[3] The financial data published by the July yearly issue of The Banker are much more extensive compared to the S&P Top 100 banks, but it's not a publication intended for the general public.\n\n\nAccounting treatment affects the assets reported: for example, the United States uses US GAAP (as opposed to IFRS), which only reports the net derivative position in most cases, leading to US banks having fewer derivative assets than comparable non-US banks.[4] If JPMorgan Chase reported under the IFRS, it would be ranked 2nd on the list as of 2023[update], rather than 5th.[2]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Rank\n | Bank name\n | Total assets(2022)(US$ billion)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n |

The ranking was based upon assets as reported and was not adjusted for different accounting treatments.[2] Another publication which has the goal to compile a yearly list of the world largest banks is The Banker Magazine. Every year in their July number a list of the World 1000 Largest Banks is published.[3] The financial data published by the July yearly issue of The Banker are much more extensive compared to the S&P Top 100 banks, but it's not a publication intended for the general public.\n\n\nAccounting treatment affects the assets reported: for example, the United States uses US GAAP (as opposed to IFRS), which only reports the net derivative position in most cases, leading to US banks having fewer derivative assets than comparable non-US banks.[4] If JPMorgan Chase reported under the IFRS, it would be ranked 2nd on the list as of 2023[update], rather than 5th.[2]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Rank\n | Bank name\n | Total assets(2022)(US$ billion)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n |

The ranking was based upon assets as reported and was not adjusted for different accounting treatments.[2] Another publication which has the goal to compile a yearly list of the world largest banks is The Banker Magazine. Every year in their July number a list of the World 1000 Largest Banks is published.[3] The financial data published by the July yearly issue of The Banker are much more extensive compared to the S&P Top 100 banks, but it's not a publication intended for the general public.\n\n\nAccounting treatment affects the assets reported: for example, the United States uses US GAAP (as opposed to IFRS), which only reports the net derivative position in most cases, leading to US banks having fewer derivative assets than comparable non-US banks.[4] If JPMorgan Chase reported under the IFRS, it would be ranked 2nd on the list as of 2023[update], rather than 5th.[2]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Rank\n | Bank name\n | Total assets(2022)(US$ billion)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | ![China](image) Industrial and

The ranking was based upon assets as reported and was not adjusted for different accounting treatments.[2] Another publication which has the goal to compile a yearly list of the world largest banks is The Banker Magazine. Every year in their July number a list of the World 1000 Largest Banks is published.[3] The financial data published by the July yearly issue of The Banker are much more extensive compared to the S&P Top 100 banks, but it's not a publication intended for the general public.\n\n\nAccounting treatment affects the assets reported: for example, the United States uses US GAAP (as opposed to IFRS), which only reports the net derivative position in most cases, leading to US banks having fewer derivative assets than comparable non-US banks.[4] If JPMorgan Chase reported under the IFRS, it would be ranked 2nd on the list as of 2023[update], rather than 5th.[2]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Rank\n | Bank name\n | Total assets(2022)(US$ billion)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n |

The ranking was based upon assets as reported and was not adjusted for different accounting treatments.[2] Another publication which has the goal to compile a yearly list of the world largest banks is The Banker Magazine. Every year in their July number a list of the World 1000 Largest Banks is published.[3] The financial data published by the July yearly issue of The Banker are much more extensive compared to the S&P Top 100 banks, but it's not a publication intended for the general public.\n\n\nAccounting treatment affects the assets reported: for example, the United States uses US GAAP (as opposed to IFRS), which only reports the net derivative position in most cases, leading to US banks having fewer derivative assets than comparable non-US banks.[4] If JPMorgan Chase reported under the IFRS, it would be ranked 2nd on the list as of 2023[update], rather than 5th.[2]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Rank\n | Bank name\n | Total assets(2022)(US$ billion)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | ![China](image) Industrial and

Eleven cornerstone investors were selected for its Hong Kong share offering, including Qatar Investment Authority and Kuwait Investment Authority, taking a combined $5.45 billion worth of shares.[26]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Companies portal\n* ![icon](image)Banks portal\n\n\n* Asset management in China\n* Banking in China\n\t+ Policy banks\n\t+ List of banks in China\n* List of companies of China\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nStrategic state-owned bank\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nABC was the last of the \"big four\" banks in China to go public. In 2010, A shares and H shares of Agricultural Bank of China were listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange respectively. Each share was set to cost between 2.7RMB and 3.3RMB per share.[17] H shares were set to cost between HK$2.88 and HK$3.48 per share.[18] The final share price for the IPO launch was issued on July 7, 2010. On completion in August 2010 it became the world's biggest initial public offering (IPO) surpassing the one set by Industrial and Commercial Bank of China in 2006 of US$21.9 billion.[19] This record has since been beaten by another Chinese company, Alibaba, in 2014.[20]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nHang Seng China Enterprises Index companies of Hong Kong\n |\n| --- |\n| * Agricultural Bank of China\n* Alibaba Group\n* Alibaba Health\n* Anta Sports\n* Baidu\n* Bank of China\n* Bank of Communications\n* Bilibili\n* BYD Company\n* CG Services\n* China Construction Bank\n* China Feihe\n* China Gas\n* China Life Insurance Company\n* China Merchants Bank\n* China Mobile\n* China Overseas Land and Investment\n* China Pacific Insurance Company\n* China Resources Beer\n* China Resources Land\n* CITIC Limited\n* CNOOC Limited\n* Country Garden\n* ENN Energy\n* Geely Auto\n* Haidilao\n* ICBC\n* Innovent Bio\n* JD Health\n* JD Logistics\n* JD.com\n* Kuaishou\n* Lenovo\n* Li-Ning\n* Longfor Properties\n* Meituan\n* Mengniu Dairy\n* NetEase\n* Nongfu Spring\n* Ping An Insurance\n* Postal Savings Bank of China\n* Shenzhou International\n* Shijiazhuang Pharma Group\n* Sino Biopharmaceutical Limited\n* Sinopec\n* SMIC\n* Sunny Optical\n* Tencent\n* Xiaomi\n* Xinyi Solar\n |\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n![China](image) Constituents of Hang Seng China 50 Index\n |\n| --- |\n| * Agricultural Bank of China\n* Alibaba Group\n* Baidu\n* Bank of China\n* Bank of Communications\n* BYD Company\n* CATL\n* China Construction Bank\n* China Life Insurance Company\n* China Merchants Bank\n* China Mobile\n* China Pacific Insurance Company\n* China Shenhua Energy\n* CITS Group Corporation\n* China Yangtze Power\n* CITIC Securities\n* CNOOC Limited\n* Foshan Haitian Flavouring & Food Co\n* Great Wall Motor\n* Gree Electric\n* Hikvision\n* ICBC\n* Industrial Bank\n* JD.com\n* Jiangsu Hengrui Medicine\n* Kuaishou\n* Kweichow Moutai\n* LONGi\n* Luxshare\n* Meituan\n* Midea Group\n* Mindray\n* Muyuan Foodstuff\n* NetEase\n* Nongfu Spring\n* PetroChina\n* Ping An Bank\n* Ping An Insurance\n* Postal Savings Bank of China\n* SF Express\n* Shanghai Pudong Development Bank\n* Shanxi Xinghuacun Fen Wine Factory\n* Sinopec\n* Tencent\n* Vanke\n* Wanhua Chemical Group\n* Wuliangye Yibin\n* WuXi AppTec\n* Xiaomi\n* Yihai Kerry Arawana Holdings\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n![China](image) Constituents of the FTSE China A50 Index\n |\n| --- |\n| * Agricultural Bank of China\n* Bank of China\n* Bank of Communications\n* Beijing\u2013Shanghai High-Speed Railway\n* BYD\n* CGN Power\n* China CITIC Bank\n* China Construction Bank\n* China Everbright Bank\n* China Merchants Bank\n* China Pacific Insurance\n* China Petroleum & Chemical\n* China Securities\n* China Shenhua Energy\n* China State Construction Engineering\n* China Tourism Group\n* China Yangtze Power\n* CITIC Securities\n* Contemporary Amperex Technology\n* East Money Information\n* Foshan Haitian Flavouring and Food\n* Foxconn Industrial Internet\n* Great Wall Motor\n* Gree Electric Appliances Inc of Zhuhai\n* Haier\n* Hygon Information Technology\n* Industrial and Commercial Bank of China\n* Industrial Bank\n* Inner Mongolia Yili Industrial\n* Jiangsu Hengrui Medicine\n* Kweichow Moutai\n* LONGi Green Energy Technology\n* Luxshare\n* Luzhou Laojiao\n* Midea Group\n* Mindray\n* Muyuan Foodstuff\n* NARI Technology\n* People's Insurance Company of China\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nABC was restructured to form a holding company called Agricultural Bank of China Limited.[11] It was listed on the Shanghai and Hong Kong stock exchanges in July 2010.[12]\n\n\nIn April 2007, ABC was the victim of the largest bank theft in Chinese history.

The ranking was based upon assets as reported and was not adjusted for different accounting treatments.[2] Another publication which has the goal to compile a yearly list of the world largest banks is The Banker Magazine. Every year in their July number a list of the World 1000 Largest Banks is published.[3] The financial data published by the July yearly issue of The Banker are much more extensive compared to the S&P Top 100 banks, but it's not a publication intended for the general public.\n\n\nAccounting treatment affects the assets reported: for example, the United States uses US GAAP (as opposed to IFRS), which only reports the net derivative position in most cases, leading to US banks having fewer derivative assets than comparable non-US banks.[4] If JPMorgan Chase reported under the IFRS, it would be ranked 2nd on the list as of 2023[update], rather than 5th.[2]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNumber of banks in the top 100 by total assets [2]\n| Rank | Country | Number\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | ![](image)\u00a0China | 20\n |\n| 2 | ![](image)\u00a0United States | 11\n |\n| 3 | ![](image)\u00a0Japan | 8\n |\n| 4\n | ![](image)\u00a0United Kingdom | 6\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0France | 6\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Canada | 6\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0South Korea | 6\n |\n| 8\n | ![](image)\u00a0Australia | 5\n |\n| 9 | ![](image)\u00a0Germany | 4\n |\n| 10\n | ![](image)\u00a0Spain | 3\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Netherlands | 3\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Singapore | 3\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Brazil | 3\n |\n| 14 | ![](image)\u00a0\u00a0Switzerland | 2\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Italy | 2\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Russia | 2\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Sweden | 2\n |\n| 18\n | ![](image)\u00a0India | 1\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Finland | 1\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Denmark | 1\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Belgium | 1\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Austria | 1\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Norway | 1\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Qatar | 1\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0United Arab Emirates | 1\n |\n\n\n\\* Includes all beneath counted banks of member states of the European Union\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | ![Japan](image) Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Holdings | 516.83\n |\n| 69\n | ![Germany](image) Commerzbank | 510.25\n |\n| 70\n | ![United States](image) Capital One | 455.25\n |\n| 71\n | ![South Korea](image) Hana Financial Group | 452.34\n |\n| 72\n | ![China](image) Bank of Beijing | 447.54\n |\n| 73\n | ![Brazil](image) Ita\u00fa Unibanco | 439.50\n |\n| 74\n | ![Singapore](image) OCBC Bank | 417.61\n |\n| 75\n | ![South Korea](image) Nonghyup Bank | 417.37\n |\n| 76\n | ![China](image) Bank of Jiangsu | 410.83\n |\n| 77\n | ![United States](image) The Bank of New York Mellon | 405.78\n |\n| 78\n | ![Netherlands](image) ABN AMRO | 405.67\n |\n| 79\n | ![China](image) Bank of Shanghai | 405.13\n |\n| 80\n | ![South Korea](image) Woori Bank | 382.05\n |\n| 81\n | ![Belgium](image) KBC Bank | 380.33\n |\n| 82\n | ![China](image) China Zheshang Bank | 380.14\n |\n| 83\n | ![Brazil](image) Banco do Brasil | 379.78\n |\n| 84\n | ![Singapore](image) United Overseas Bank | 376.07\n |\n| 85\n | ![Japan](image) Nomura Holdings | 373.41\n |\n| 86\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | ![Germany](image) Landesbank Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg | 346.45\n |\n| 87\n | ![Austria](image) Erste Group | 346.12\n |\n| 88\n | ![South Korea](image) Industrial Bank of Korea | 343.49\n |\n| 89\n | ![China](image) Bank of Ningbo | 343.05\n |\n| 90\n | ![Brazil](image) Banco Bradesco | 340.41\n |\n| 91\n | ![Sweden](image) SEB Group | 338.91\n |\n| 92\n | ![Russia](image) VTB Bank | 335.11\n |\n| 93\n | ![Sweden](image) Handelsbanken | 331.32\n |\n| 94\n | ![Norway](image) DNB ASA | 328.50\n |\n| 95\n | ![Qatar](image) Qatar National Bank | 323.56\n |\n| 96\n | ![Canada](image) National Bank of Canada | 312.67\n |\n| 97\n | ![Australia](image) Macquarie Group | 313.47\n |\n| 98\n | ![United Kingdom](image) Nationwide Building Society | 311.93\n |\n| 99\n | ![Switzerland](image) Raiffeisen Gruppe | 303.50\n |\n| 100\n | ![United Arab Emirates](image) First Abu Dhabi Bank | 302.22\n |\n\n\n### Banks by country or territory[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
