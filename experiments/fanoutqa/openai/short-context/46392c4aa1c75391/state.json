Here are some of the dominant types of animal life found in the Arabian Desert:\n\n1. **Arabian Oryx**:\n   - The Arabian oryx is a medium-sized antelope with a distinct shoulder bump, long, straight horns, and a tufted tail. It is native to desert and steppe areas of the Arabian Peninsula. The Arabian oryx was extinct in the wild by the early 1970s but was saved in zoos and private reserves and reintroduced into the wild starting in 1980. They prefer gravel deserts or hard sand areas and can survive on very little water and food.\n\n2. **Arabian Wolf**:\n   - The Arabian wolf is a subspecies of the gray wolf native to the Arabian Peninsula. It is the smallest gray wolf subspecies and is adapted to arid environments. Arabian wolves are omnivorous and opportunistic eaters, consuming small to medium-sized prey, including insects, reptiles, birds, rodents, and small ungulates.\n\n3. **Arabian Ostrich**:\n   - The Arabian ostrich, also known as the Syrian ostrich, was an extinct subspecies of the ostrich that lived on the Arabian Peninsula and in the Near East until the mid-20th century. It was once common in the region but became extinct due to excessive hunting and habitat loss.\n\n4. **Arabian Horse**:\n   - The Arabian horse is a breed that developed in the desert climate and was prized by the nomadic Bedouin people. It is known for its endurance, speed, and ability to thrive on very little food and water. Arabian horses are now found worldwide and are known for their versatility in various equestrian sports.\n\n5. **Arabian Leopard**:\n   - The Arabian leopard is a critically endangered subspecies of the leopard found in the Arabian Peninsula. It prefers mountainous uplands and hilly steppes and preys on small to medium-sized animals, including Arabian gazelle, Nubian ibex, and various small mammals and birds.\n\nThese species are well-adapted to the extreme conditions of the Arabian Desert, showcasing a range of survival strategies and ecological roles.",

It is the fifth largest desert in the world and the largest in Asia. At its center is *Ar-Rub' al-Khali* (The Empty Quarter), one of the largest continuous bodies of sand in the world. It is an extension of the Sahara Desert.[4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** \"Arabian Desert and East Sahero-Arabian xeric shrublands\".

It extends into neighboring southern Iraq, southern Jordan, central Qatar, most of the Abu Dhabi emirate in the United Arab Emirates, western Oman, and northeastern Yemen. The ecoregion also includes most of the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt and the adjacent Negev desert in southern Israel.[1]\n\n\nThe Rub' al-Khali desert is a sedimentary basin stretching along a south-west to north-east axis across the Arabian Shelf.[5] At an altitude of 1,000 metres (3,300\u00a0ft), rock landscapes yield to the Rub' al-Khali, a vast stretch of sand whose extreme southern point crosses the center of Yemen. The sand overlies gravel or gypsum plains and the dunes reach maximum heights of up to 250\u00a0m (820\u00a0ft). The sands are predominantly silicates, composed of 80 to 90% quartz and the remainder feldspar, whose iron oxide-coated grains color the sands orange, purple, and red.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Europe | * Bardenas Reales\n* Cabo de Gata\n* Monegros\n* Oleshky\n* Tabernas\n* Deliblato\n |\n| North America | * Alvord\n* Amargosa\n* Baja California\n* Black Rock\n* Carcross\n* Carson\n* Channeled scablands\n* Chihuahuan\n* Colorado\n* Escalante\n* Forty Mile\n* Gran Desierto de Altar\n* Great Basin\n* Great Salt Lake\n* Great Sandy\n* Jornada del Muerto\n* Ka\u02bb\u016b\n* Lechuguilla\n* Mojave\n* North American Arctic\n* Owyhee\n* Painted Desert\n* Red Desert\n* Sevier\n* Smoke Creek\n* Sonoran\n* Tonopah Desert\n* Tule (Arizona)\n* Tule (Nevada)\n* Yuha\n* Yuma\n |\n| Oceania | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Australia | * Gibson\n* Great Sandy\n* Great Victoria\n* Little Sandy\n* Nullarbor Plain\n* Painted\n* Pedirka\n* Simpson\n* Strzelecki\n* Sturt Stony\n* Tanami\n* Tirari\n |\n| New Zealand | * Rangipo\n |\n\n |\n| South America | * Atacama\n* La Guajira\n* Los M\u00e9danos de Coro\n* Monte\n* Patagonian\n* Sechura\n* Tatacoa\n |\n| Polar regions | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n12. **^** UNEP-WCMC (2020).

Because of its qualities of endurance and speed, the dromedary is the favourite animal used by nomads.\n\n\nHuman activities are more likely to affect the habitat in areas of permanent water (oases) or where water comes close to the surface. Here, the local pressure on natural resources can be intense. The remaining populations of large mammals have been greatly reduced by hunting for food and recreation. In recent years development projects have started in the deserts of Algeria and Tunisia using irrigated water pumped from underground aquifers. These schemes often lead to soil degradation and salinization.\n\n\nResearchers from Hacettepe University have reported that Saharan soil may have bio-available iron and also some essential macro and micro nutrient elements suitable for use as fertilizer for growing wheat.[58]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)An Idehan Ubari oasis lake, with native grasses and date palms\nOther animals include the monitor lizards, hyrax, sand vipers, and small populations of African wild dog,[54] in perhaps only 14 countries[55] and red-necked ostrich. Other animals exist in the Sahara (birds in particular) such as African silverbill and black-faced firefinch, among others. There are also small desert crocodiles in Mauritania and the Ennedi Plateau of Chad.[56]\n\n\nThe deathstalker scorpion can be 10\u00a0cm (3.9\u00a0in) long. Its venom contains large amounts of agitoxin and scyllatoxin and is very dangerous; however, a sting from this scorpion rarely kills a healthy adult. The Saharan silver ant is unique in that due to the extreme high temperatures of their habitat, and the threat of predators, the ants are active outside their nest for only about ten minutes per day.[57]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPeople lived on the edge of the desert thousands of years ago,[59] since the end of the last glacial period. In the Central Sahara, engraved and painted rock art were created perhaps as early as 10,000 years ago, spanning the Bubaline Period, Kel Essuf Period, Round Head Period, Pastoral Period, Caballine Period, and Cameline Period.[60] The Sahara was then a much wetter place than it is today. Over 30,000 petroglyphs of river animals such as crocodiles[61] survive, with half found in the Tassili n'Ajjer in southeast Algeria. Fossils of dinosaurs,[62] including *Afrovenator*, *Jobaria* and *Ouranosaurus*, have also been found here. The modern Sahara, though, is not lush in vegetation, except in the Nile Valley, at a few oases, and in the northern highlands, where Mediterranean plants such as the olive tree are found to grow. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSeveral species of fox live in the Sahara including: the fennec fox, pale fox and R\u00fcppell's fox. The addax, a large white antelope, can go nearly a year in the desert without drinking. The dorcas gazelle is a north African gazelle that can also go for a long time without water. Other notable gazelles include the rhim gazelle and dama gazelle.\n\n\nThe Saharan cheetah (northwest African cheetah) lives in Algeria, Togo, Niger, Mali, Benin, and Burkina Faso. There remain fewer than 250 mature cheetahs, which are very cautious, fleeing any human presence. The cheetah avoids the sun from April to October, seeking the shelter of shrubs such as balanites and acacias. They are unusually pale.[52][53] The other cheetah subspecies (northeast African cheetah) lives in Chad, Sudan and the eastern region of Niger. However, it is currently extinct in the wild in Egypt and Libya. There are approximately 2000 mature individuals left in the wild.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe flora of the Sahara is highly diversified based on the bio-geographical characteristics of this vast desert. Floristically, the Sahara has three zones based on the amount of rainfall received \u2013 the Northern (Mediterranean), Central and Southern Zones. There are two transitional zones \u2013 the Mediterranean-Sahara transition and the Sahel transition zone.[50]\n\n\nThe Saharan flora comprises around 2800 species of vascular plants. Approximately a quarter of these are endemic. About half of these species are common to the flora of the Arabian deserts.[51]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)An oasis in the Ahaggar Mountains. Oases support some life forms in extremely arid deserts.\nThe Sahara is the world's largest hot desert.[17][18] It is located in the horse latitudes under the subtropical ridge, a significant belt of semi-permanent subtropical warm-core high pressure where the air from the upper troposphere usually descends, warming and drying the lower troposphere and preventing cloud formation.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Sahara is mainly rocky hamada (stone plateaus); ergs (sand seas \u2013 large areas covered with sand dunes) form only a minor part, but many of the sand dunes are over 180 metres (590\u00a0ft) high.[11] Wind or rare rainfall shape the desert features: sand dunes, dune fields, sand seas, stone plateaus, gravel plains (*reg*), dry valleys (*wadi*), dry lakes (*oued*), and salt flats (*shatt* or *chott*).[12] Unusual landforms include the Richat Structure in Mauritania.\n\n\nSeveral deeply dissected mountains, many volcanic, rise from the desert, including the A\u00efr Mountains, Ahaggar Mountains, Saharan Atlas, Tibesti Mountains, Adrar des Iforas, and the Red Sea Hills. The highest peak in the Sahara is Emi Koussi, a shield volcano in the Tibesti range of northern Chad.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Camels in the Guelta d'Archei, in north-eastern Chad\nThe central Sahara is estimated to include five hundred species of plants, which is extremely low considering the huge extent of the area. Plants such as acacia trees, palms, succulents, spiny shrubs, and grasses have adapted to the arid conditions, by growing lower to avoid water loss by strong winds, by storing water in their thick stems to use it in dry periods, by having long roots that travel horizontally to reach the maximum area of water and to find any surface moisture, and by having small thick leaves or needles to prevent water loss by evapotranspiration. Plant leaves may dry out totally and then recover.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe central Sahara is hyperarid, with sparse vegetation. The northern and southern reaches of the desert, along with the highlands, have areas of sparse grassland and desert shrub, with trees and taller shrubs in wadis, where moisture collects. In the central, hyperarid region, there are many subdivisions of the great desert: Tanezrouft, the T\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9, the Libyan Desert, the Eastern Desert, the Nubian Desert and others. These extremely arid areas often receive no rain for years.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* The Saharan halophytics is an area of seasonally flooded saline depressions which is home to halophytic (salt-adapted) plant communities. The Saharan halophytics cover 54,000 square kilometres (21,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) including: the Qattara and Siwa depressions in northern Egypt, the Tunisian salt lakes of central Tunisia, Chott Melghir in Algeria, and smaller areas of Algeria, Mauritania, and the southern part of Morocco.[49]\n* The Tanezrouft is one of the Sahara's most arid regions, with no vegetation and very little life. A barren, flat gravel plain, it extends south of Reggane in Algeria towards the Adrar des Ifoghas highlands in northern Mali.\n\n\n## Flora and fauna[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* The Sahara desert ecoregion covers the hyper-arid central portion of the Sahara where rainfall is minimal and sporadic. Vegetation is rare, and this ecoregion consists mostly of sand dunes (*erg, chech, raoui*), stone plateaus (*hamadas*), gravel plains (*reg*), dry valleys (*wadis*), and salt flats. It covers 4,639,900 square kilometres (1,791,500\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of: Algeria, Chad, Egypt, Libya, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, and Sudan.[12]\n* The South Saharan steppe and woodlands ecoregion is a narrow band running east and west between the hyper-arid Sahara and the Sahel savannas to the south. Movements of the equatorial Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) bring summer rains during July and August which average 100 to 200\u00a0mm (4 to 8\u00a0in) but vary greatly from year to year. These rains sustain summer pastures of grasses and herbs, with dry woodlands and shrublands along seasonal watercourses. This ecoregion covers 1,101,700 square kilometres (425,400\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) in Algeria, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, and Sudan.[46]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n12. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Sahara desert\". *Terrestrial Ecoregions*.

With an area of 9,200,000 square kilometres (3,600,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), it is the largest hot desert in the world and the third-largest desert overall, smaller only than the deserts of Antarctica and the northern Arctic.[1][2][3]\n\n\nThe name \"Sahara\" is derived from the Arabic word for \"desert\" in the feminine irregular form, the singular *\u1e63a\u1e25ra'* (\u0635\u062d\u0631\u0627\u0621 /\u02c8s\u02e4a\u0127ra/), plural *\u1e63a\u1e25\u0101r\u0101* (\u0635\u064e\u062d\u064e\u0627\u0631\u064e\u0649 /\u02c8s\u02e4a\u0127a\u02d0ra\u02d0/),[4][5][6][7] *\u1e63a\u1e25\u0101r* (\u0635\u064e\u062d\u064e\u0627\u0631), *\u1e63a\u1e25r\u0101w\u0101t* (\u0635\u064e\u062d\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0627\u0648\u064e\u0627\u062a), *\u1e63a\u1e25\u0101riy* (\u0635\u064e\u062d\u064e\u0627\u0631\u0650\u064a).\n\n\nThe desert covers much of North Africa, excluding the fertile region on the Mediterranean Sea coast, the Atlas Mountains of the Maghreb, and the Nile Valley in Egypt and the Sudan.[8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* The Atlantic coastal desert is a narrow strip along the Atlantic coast where fog generated offshore by the cool Canary Current provides sufficient moisture to sustain a variety of lichens, succulents, and shrubs. It covers an area of 39,900 square kilometers (15,400\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) in the south of Morocco and Mauritania.[44]\n* The North Saharan steppe and woodlands is along the northern desert, next to the Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub ecoregions of the northern Maghreb and Cyrenaica. Winter rains sustain shrublands and dry woodlands that form a transition between the Mediterranean climate regions to the north and the hyper-arid Sahara proper to the south. It covers 1,675,300 square kilometers (646,840\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) in Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, and Tunisia.[45]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe sudden subsequent movement of the ITCZ southwards with a Heinrich event (a sudden cooling followed by a slower warming), linked to changes with the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation cycle, led to a rapid drying out of the Saharan and Arabian regions, which quickly became desert. This is linked to a marked decline in the scale of the Nile floods between 2700 and 2100 BCE.[43]\n\n\n\n## Ecoregions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The major topographic features of the Saharan region\nThe Sahara comprises several distinct ecoregions.

The prevailing air mass lying above the Sahara is the continental tropical (cT) air mass, which is hot and dry. Hot, dry air masses primarily form over the North-African desert from the heating of the vast continental land area, and it affects the whole desert during most of the year. Because of this extreme heating process, a thermal low is usually noticed near the surface, and is the strongest and the most developed during the summertime. The Sahara High represents the eastern continental extension of the Azores High,[*citation needed*] centered over the North Atlantic Ocean. The subsidence of the Sahara High nearly reaches the ground during the coolest part of the year, while it is confined to the upper troposphere during the hottest periods.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFurther information: Saharan languages, Saharan rock art, and Rock art \u00a7\u00a0Sahara\n\n![](image)A 19th-century engraving of an Arab slave-trading caravan transporting black African slaves across the Sahara\nThe people of the Sahara are of various origins. Among them the Amazigh including the Tuareg, various Arabized Amazi\u0263 groups such as the Hassaniya-speaking Sahrawis, whose populations include the Znaga, a tribe whose name is a remnant of the pre-historic Zenaga language. Other major groups of people include the: Toubou, Nubians, Zaghawa, Kanuri, Hausa, Songhai, Beja, and Fula/Fulani (French: *Peul*; Fula: *Ful\u0253e*). The archaeological evidence from the Holocene period has shown that Nilo-Saharan speaking groups had populated the central and southern Sahara before the influx of Berber and Arabic speakers, around 1500 years ago, who now largely populate the Sahara in the modern era.[111]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe climate of the Sahara has undergone enormous variations between wet and dry over the last few hundred thousand years,[29] believed to be caused by long-term changes in the North African climate cycle that alters the path of the North African Monsoon \u2013 usually southward. The cycle is caused by a 41,000-year cycle in which the tilt of the earth changes between 22\u00b0 and 24.5\u00b0.[25] At present, we are in a dry period, but it is expected that the Sahara will become green again in 15,000 years. When the North African monsoon is at its strongest, annual precipitation and subsequent vegetation in the Sahara region increase, resulting in conditions commonly referred to as the \"green Sahara\". For a relatively weak North African monsoon, the opposite is true, with decreased annual precipitation and less vegetation resulting in a phase of the Sahara climate cycle known as the \"desert Sahara\".[30]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTo the south, the Sahara is bounded by the Sahel, a belt of dry tropical savanna with a summer rainy season that extends across Africa from east to west. The southern limit of the Sahara is indicated botanically by the southern limit of *Cornulaca monacantha* (a drought-tolerant member of the Chenopodiaceae), or northern limit of *Cenchrus biflorus*, a grass typical of the Sahel.[14][15] According to climatic criteria, the southern limit of the Sahara corresponds to the 150\u00a0mm (5.9\u00a0in) isohyet of annual precipitation (this is a long-term average, since precipitation varies annually).[16]\n\n\nImportant cities located in the Sahara include Nouakchott, the capital of Mauritania; Tamanrasset, Ouargla, B\u00e9char, Hassi Messaoud, Gharda\u00efa, and El Oued in Algeria; Timbuktu in Mali; Agadez in Niger; Ghat in Libya; and Faya-Largeau in Chad.\n\n\n\n## Climate[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

The ibex was one of the most sacred animals in South Arabia, while the oryx antelope was associated with the god Attar, 5th century BC.\nThe Arabian oryx is the national animal of Jordan, Oman, the United Arab Emirates,[17] Bahrain, and Qatar.[18]\n\n\nThe Arabian oryx is also the namesake of several businesses on the Arabian peninsula, notably Al Maha Airways and Al Maha Petroleum.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOther than humans, wolves are the Arabian oryx's only predator. In captivity and safe conditions in the wild, Arabian oryxes have a lifespan of up to 20 years.[7] In periods of drought, though, their life expectancy may be significantly reduced by malnutrition and dehydration. Other causes of death include fights between males, snakebites, disease, and drowning during floods.[8]\n\n\n\n## Distribution and habitat[edit]\n\n\nHistorically, the Arabian oryx probably ranged throughout most of the Middle East. In the early 1800s, they could still be found in the Sinai, Palestine, the Transjordan, much of Iraq, and most of the Arabian Peninsula. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, their range was pushed back towards Saudi Arabia, and by 1914, only a few survived outside that country. A few were reported in Jordan into the 1930s, but by the mid-1930s, the only remaining populations were in the Nafud Desert in northwestern Saudi Arabia and the Rub' al Khali in the south.[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSpecies of antelope\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Arabian oryx\n |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) |\n| Male in Dubai Desert Conservation Reserve |\n| Conservation status\n |\n| ![](image)Vulnerable \u00a0(IUCN 3.1)[1]\n |\n| CITES Appendix I\u00a0(CITES)[1]\n |\n| Scientific classification ![Edit this classification](image) |\n| Domain:\n | Eukaryota |\n| Kingdom:\n | Animalia |\n| Phylum:\n | Chordata |\n| Class:\n | Mammalia |\n| Order:\n | Artiodactyla |\n| Family:\n | Bovidae |\n| Subfamily:\n | Hippotraginae |\n| Genus:\n | *Oryx* |\n| Species:\n | ***O.\u00a0leucoryx***\n |\n| Binomial name |\n| ***Oryx leucoryx***(Pallas, 1777)\n |\n\n\nThe **Arabian oryx** or **white oryx** (***Oryx leucoryx***) is a medium-sized antelope with a distinct shoulder bump, long, straight horns, and a tufted tail.[2] It is a bovid, and the smallest member of the genus *Oryx*, native to desert and steppe areas of the Arabian Peninsula. The Arabian oryx was extinct in the wild by the early 1970s, but was saved in zoos and private reserves, and was reintroduced into the wild starting in 1980.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)In Yotvata Hai-Bar Nature Reserve in Israel\nAn Arabian oryx stands between 2.6 to 4.1 feet tall at the shoulder and typically weighs between 220 to 460\u00a0lb (100 to 209\u00a0kg).[5] Its coat is an almost luminous white, the undersides and legs are brown, and black stripes occur where the head meets the neck, on the forehead, on the nose, and going from the horn down across the eye to the mouth. Both sexes have long, straight or slightly curved, ringed horns which are 2 to 4.9 feet (60 to 150 centimeters) long.[5]\n\n\nArabian oryxes rest during the heat of the day. They can detect rainfall and move towards it, meaning they have huge ranges; a herd in Oman can range over 3,000\u00a0km2 (1,200\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). Packs are of mixed sex and usually contain between 2 and 15 animals, though herds of up to 100 have been reported. Arabian oryxes are generally not aggressive toward one another, which allows herds to exist peacefully for some time.[6]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe diets of the Arabian oryx consist mainly of grasses, but they eat a large variety of vegetation, including buds, herbs, fruit, tubers and roots. Herds of Arabian oryxes follow infrequent rains to eat the new plants that grow afterwards. They can go for several weeks without water.[6] Research in Oman has found grasses of the genus *Stipagrostis* are primarily taken; flowers from *Stipagrostis* plants appeared highest in crude protein and water, while leaves seemed a better food source with other vegetation.[10]\n\n\n\n### Behavior[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Its main stronghold was the northern An Nafud northwards to the Syrian Desert, between latitudes 34\u00b0N and 25\u00b0N and longitude 38\u00b0E eastwards to the Euphrates Valley, and it was most plentiful in Al Jawf Province, where it associated with herds of Saudi gazelle and Arabian oryx, animals that are now extinct or very rare respectively. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Arabian ostrich's range seems to have been continuous in prehistoric times, but with the drying-up of the Arabian Peninsula, it disappeared from the inhospitable areas of the Arabian Desert, such as the Rub' al Khali.

The desert environment required a domesticated horse to cooperate with humans to survive; humans were the only providers of food and water in certain areas, and even hardy Arabian horses needed far more water than camels in order to survive (most horses can only live about 72\u00a0hours without water). Where there was no pasture or water, the Bedouin fed their horses dates and camel's milk.[85] The desert horse needed the ability to thrive on very little food, and to have anatomical traits to compensate for life in a dry climate with wide temperature extremes from day to night. Weak individuals were weeded out of the breeding pool, and the animals that remained were also honed by centuries of human warfare.[86]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Arabian developed in a desert climate and was prized by the nomadic Bedouin people, often being brought inside the family tent for shelter and protection from theft. Selective breeding for traits, including an ability to form a cooperative relationship with humans, created a horse breed that is good-natured, quick to learn, and willing to please. The Arabian also developed the high spirit and alertness needed in a horse used for raiding and war. This combination of willingness and sensitivity requires modern Arabian horse owners to handle their horses with competence and respect.\n\n\nThe Arabian is a versatile breed. Arabians dominate the discipline of endurance riding and compete today in many other fields of equestrian sport. They are one of the top ten most popular horse breeds in the world. They are now found worldwide, including the United States and Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, continental Europe, South America (especially Brazil), and their land of origin, the Middle East.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Bedouin way of life depended on camels and horses: Arabians were bred to be war horses with speed, endurance, soundness, and intelligence.[86][87] Because many raids required stealth, mares were preferred over stallions as they were quieter, and therefore would not give away the position of the fighters.[86] A good disposition was also critical; prized war mares were often brought inside family tents to prevent theft and for protection from weather and predators.[88] Though appearance was not necessarily a survival factor, the Bedouin bred for refinement and beauty in their horses as well as for more practical features.[87]\n\n\n\n### Strains and pedigrees[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSome 20th-century scholars of the Arabian horse once theorized that the Arabian came from a separate subspecies of horse,[78] known as *equus caballus pumpelli*.[79] However, others, including Gladys Brown Edwards, a noted Arabian researcher, stated that the \"dry\" oriental horses of the desert, from which the modern Arabian developed, were *Equus ferus caballus* with specific landrace characteristics based on the environments in which they lived, rather than being a separate subspecies.[10][79] Horses with similar, though not identical, physical characteristics include the Marwari horse of India, the Barb of North Africa, the Akhal-Teke of western Asia and the now-extinct Turkoman Horse.[79]\n\n\n\n### Desert roots[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHorse breed originating in the Middle East\n\nFor other uses, see Arabian horse (disambiguation).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArabian horse| ![](image)An Arabian mare\n |\n| Other names | Arabian, Arab |\n| Country of origin | Developed in the Middle East, most notably Arabian peninsula |\n| Distribution | Worldwide from Middle East and North Africa origins[1] |\n| Traits |\n| Weight | * 800 to 1,000\u00a0lb (360 to 450\u00a0kg)\n |\n| Height | * 14.1 to 15.1\u00a0hands (57 to 61\u00a0inches, 145 to 155\u00a0cm)\n |\n| Color | Bay, black, chestnut, or gray.

Since local people reduced ungulates to small populations, leopards are forced to alter their diet to smaller prey and livestock such as goats, sheep, donkeys and young camels.[14]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n8. **^** Biquand, S.

It has been suggested that human poaching has reduced the leopard population to an extent that natural competition with other predators is now a threatening factor. Population viability analysis in Saudi Arabia suggests that under stable natural conditions in absence of poaching and restocking, the Arabian leopard would have a survival probability of only 37%; without competition by the caracal, this would increase to 89%; and without the Arabian wolf to 98%. Assuming a moderate poaching rate of six individuals per year would lead to extirpation over the next 100 years.[26]\n\n\nInformation about ecology and behaviour of Arabian leopards in the wild is very limited.[17] A leopard from the Judean desert is reported to have come into heat in March. After a gestation period of 13 weeks, females give birth to two to four cubs in a cave amidst boulders or in a burrow.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nLeopard subspecies in the Arabian Peninsula\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Arabian leopard\n |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) |\n| Leopard at Ein Gedi, Israel |\n| Conservation status\n |\n| ![](image)Critically Endangered \u00a0(IUCN 3.1)[1]\n |\n| Scientific classification ![Edit this classification](image) |\n| Domain:\n | Eukaryota |\n| Kingdom:\n | Animalia |\n| Phylum:\n | Chordata |\n| Class:\n | Mammalia |\n| Order:\n | Carnivora |\n| Suborder:\n | Feliformia |\n| Family:\n | Felidae |\n| Subfamily:\n | Pantherinae |\n| Genus:\n | *Panthera* |\n| Species:\n | *P.\u00a0pardus*\n |\n| Subspecies:\n | ***P.\u00a0p. nimr***\n |\n| Trinomial name |\n| ***Panthera pardus nimr***(Hemprich and Ehrenberg), 1833\n |\n| ![](image) |\n| Distribution of the Arabian leopard\n |\n| Synonyms |\n| *P. p. jarvisl* Pocock, 1932\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n## Distribution and habitat[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Captive leopard in the Breeding Centre for Endangered Wildlife, Sharjah\nThe geographic range of the Arabian leopard is poorly understood but generally considered to be limited to the Arabian Peninsula, including Egypt's Sinai Peninsula.[11] It lives in mountainous uplands and hilly steppes, but seldom moves to open plains, desert or coastal lowlands.[10] It prefers well-vegetated terrain that is difficult for humans to reach.[12] Since the late 1990s, leopards were not recorded in Egypt.[7] One individual was killed in the Elba Protected Area in 2014.[13]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n28. **^** Budd, K.

Here are some of the dominant types of animal life found in the Arabian Desert:\n\n1. **Arabian Oryx**:\n   - The Arabian oryx is a medium-sized antelope with a distinct shoulder bump, long, straight horns, and a tufted tail. It is native to desert and steppe areas of the Arabian Peninsula. The Arabian oryx was extinct in the wild by the early 1970s but was saved in zoos and private reserves and reintroduced into the wild starting in 1980. They prefer gravel deserts or hard sand areas and can survive on very little water and food.\n\n2. **Arabian Wolf**:\n   - The Arabian wolf is a subspecies of the gray wolf native to the Arabian Peninsula. It is the smallest gray wolf subspecies and is adapted to arid environments. Arabian wolves are omnivorous and opportunistic eaters, consuming small to medium-sized prey, including insects, reptiles, birds, rodents, and small ungulates.\n\n3. **Arabian Ostrich**:\n   - The Arabian ostrich, also known as the Syrian ostrich, was an extinct subspecies of the ostrich that lived on the Arabian Peninsula and in the Near East until the mid-20th century. It was once common in the region but became extinct due to excessive hunting and habitat loss.\n\n4. **Arabian Horse**:\n   - The Arabian horse is a breed that developed in the desert climate and was prized by the nomadic Bedouin people. It is known for its endurance, speed, and ability to thrive on very little food and water. Arabian horses are now found worldwide and are known for their versatility in various equestrian sports.\n\n5. **Arabian Leopard**:\n   - The Arabian leopard is a critically endangered subspecies of the leopard found in the Arabian Peninsula. It prefers mountainous uplands and hilly steppes and preys on small to medium-sized animals, including Arabian gazelle, Nubian ibex, and various small mammals and birds.\n\nThese species are well-adapted to the extreme conditions of the Arabian Desert, showcasing a range of survival strategies and ecological roles.",

They are occasionally visited by snow leopards, Gobi bears, and wolves. Lizards are especially well-adapted to the climate of the Gobi Desert, with approximately 30 species distributed across its southern Mongolian border.[10] The most common vegetation in the Gobi desert are shrubs adapted to drought.[11] These shrubs included gray sparrow's saltwort (*Salsola passerina*), gray sagebrush, and low grasses such as needle grass and bridlegrass. Due to livestock grazing, the amount of shrubs in the desert has decreased.[11] Several large nature reserves have been established in the Gobi, including Gobi Gurvansaikhan National Park, Great Gobi A and Great Gobi B Strictly Protected Area.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAlthough the southeast monsoons reach the southeast parts of the Gobi, the area throughout this region is generally characterized by extreme dryness, especially during the winter, when the Siberian anticyclone is at its strongest. The southern and central parts of the Gobi Desert have variable plant growth due to this monsoon activity. The more northern areas of the Gobi are very cold and dry, making it unable to support much plant growth; this cold and dry weather is attributed to Siberian-Mongolian high pressure cells.[7] Hence, the icy dust and snowstorms of spring and early summer[2] plus early January (winter).\n\n\n\n## Conservation, ecology, and economy[edit]\n\n\nThe Gobi Desert is the source of many important fossils finds, including the first dinosaur eggs, twenty-six of which, averaging 23 centimetres (9\u00a0in) in length, were uncovered in 1923.[8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n7. **^** Sternberg, Troy; Rueff, Henri; Middleton, Nick (2015-01-26). \"Contraction of the Gobi Desert, 2000\u20132012\". *Remote Sensing*. **7** (2): 1346\u20131358.

The Kuruk-tagh is throughout a relatively low, but almost completely barren range, being entirely destitute of animal life, save for hares, antelopes and wild camels, which frequent its few small, widely scattered oases. The vegetation, which is confined to these same areas, is of the scantiest and is mainly confined to bushes of saxaul *(Haloxylon)*, *anabasis*, reeds (kamish), tamarisks, poplars, and Ephedra.[2]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Prehistory[edit]\n\n\nThere is little information about early habitation of the Gobi desert. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n> The structure here is that of the mighty T'ien Shan, or Heavenly Mountains, running from west to east. It divides the northern one-third of Sinkiang from the southern two-thirds. On the northern side, rivers formed from the snow and glaciers of the high mountains break through barren foothill ranges and flow out into an immense, hollow plain. Here the rivers begin to straggle and fan out, and form great marshes with dense reed-beds. Westerners call this terrain the Dzungarian desert. The Chinese also call it a desert, but the Mongols call it a 'gobi'\u2014that is, a land of thin herbage, more suitable for camels than for cows, but capable also, if herds are kept small and moved frequently, of sustaining horses, sheep, and goats. The herbage comprises a high proportion of woody, fragrant plants. Gobi mutton is the most aromatic in the world.[20]\n> \n> \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Gobi by NASA World Wind\n![](image)Sand dunes in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, China\n![](image)Flaming Cliffs in Mongolia\n![](image)Sacred ovoo in the Gobi Desert\n![](image)The sand dunes of Khongoryn Els, Gurvansaikhan NP, Mongolia\n![](image)Remains of the Great Wall of China in the Gobi Desert\nThe Gobi is overall a cold desert, with frost and occasionally snow occurring on its dunes. Besides being quite far north, it is also located on a plateau roughly 910\u20131,520\u00a0m (2,990\u20134,990\u00a0ft) above sea level, which contributes to its low temperatures. An average of about 194\u00a0mm (7.6\u00a0in) of rain falls annually in the Gobi. Additional moisture reaches parts of the Gobi in winter as snow is blown by the wind from the Siberian Steppes. These winds may cause the Gobi to reach \u221240\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221240\u00a0\u00b0F) in winter to 45\u00a0\u00b0C (113\u00a0\u00b0F) in summer.[5]\n\n\nHowever, the climate of the Gobi is one of great extremes,[2] with rapid changes of temperature[2] of as much as 35\u00a0\u00b0C (63\u00a0\u00b0F) in 24-hour spans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nCharacteristic of the flora are wild garlic, *Kalidium gracile*, wormwood, saxaul, *Nitraria schoberi*, *Caragana*, Ephedra, saltwort and the grass *Lasiagrostis splendens*.[2] The taana wild onion *Allium polyrrhizum* is the main browse eaten by many herd animals, and Mongolians claim that this is essential in producing the proper, hazelnut-like notes of camel airag (fermented milk).\n\n\nThe vast desert is crisscrossed by several trade routes, some of which have been in use for thousands of years. Among the most important are those from Kalgan (at the Great Wall) to Ulaanbaatar (960\u00a0km (597\u00a0mi)); from Jiuquan (in Gansu) to Hami 670\u00a0km (416\u00a0mi); from Hami to Beijing (2,000\u00a0km (1,243\u00a0mi)); from Hohhot to Hami and Barkul; and from Lanzhou (in Gansu) to Hami.[2]\n\n\n\n### Alashan Plateau semi-desert[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Alashan Plateau semi-desert\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Eastern Asia | * Alashan Plateau semi-desert\n* Dzungaria\n* Eastern Gobi desert steppe\n* Gobi Lakes Valley desert steppe\n* Great Lakes Basin desert steppe\n* Qaidam Basin\n* Taklamakan Desert\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nWorld deserts\n |\n| --- |\n| * Desert\n* Desertification\n* Polar desert\n* List of deserts\n* List of deserts by area\n* Desert exploration\n |\n| Africa | * Algerian\n* Bayuda\n* Black Desert\n* Blue\n* Chalbi\n* Danakil\n* Djurab\n* Eastern\n* Ferlo\n* Farafra (White)\n* Kalahari\n* Libyan\n* Mo\u00e7\u00e2medes\n* Namib\n* Nubian\n* Nyiri\n* Plaine des Sables\n* Richtersveld\n* Sahara\n* Tanezrouft\n* T\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9\n* Western\n |\n| Asia | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Chao SC (1984). \"The sandy deserts and the gobi of China\".

Previously havens for wild animals from elephants to giraffes, and for predators such as lions and cheetahs, the riverbeds are now mostly grazing spots. However, leopards and cheetahs can still be found. The area is now heavily grazed, and cattle fences restrict wildlife movement. Among deserts of the Southern Hemisphere, the Kalahari most closely resembles some Australian deserts in its latitude and mode of formation.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Kalahari has had a complex climatic history over the past million or so years, in line with major global changes. Changes in the last 250,000 years have been reconstructed from various data sources, providing evidence of former extensive lakes and drier periods. During the latter, the area of the Kalahari has expanded to include parts of western Zimbabwe, Zambia, and Angola.[12]\n\n\n\n## Vegetation and flora[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Devil's thorn flower (Tribulus zeyheri) growing in the Kalahari Desert\n![](image)Camel thorn scattered on dunes in the Kalahari Desert\nDue to its low aridity, the Kalahari supports a variety of flora. The native flora includes acacia trees and many other herbs and grasses.[13] The kiwano fruit, also known as the horned melon, melano, African horned cucumber, jelly melon, or hedged gourd, is endemic to a region in the Kalahari Desert (specific region unknown).[14]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA semi-desert, with huge tracts of excellent grazing after good rains, the Kalahari supports more animals and plants than a true desert, such as the Namib Desert to the west. There is little rainfall, and the summer temperature is very high. The driest areas usually receive 110\u2013200 millimetres (4.3\u20137.9\u00a0in) of rain per year,[1] and the wettest just a little over 500 millimetres (20\u00a0in). The surrounding Kalahari Basin covers over 2,500,000 square kilometres (970,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) extending farther into Botswana, Namibia, and South Africa, encroaching into parts of Angola, Zambia and Zimbabwe.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAlthough there are few endemic species, a wide variety of species are found in the region, including large predators such as the lion (*Panthera leo*), cheetah (*Acinonyx jubatus*), leopard (*Panthera pardus*), spotted hyena (*Crocuta crocuta*), brown hyena (*Parahyaena brunnea*), and African wild dog (*Lycaon pictus pictus*). Birds of prey include the secretary bird (*Sagittarius serpentarius*), martial eagle (*Polemaetus bellicosus*) and other eagles, the giant eagle owl (*Bubo lacteus*) and other owls, falcons, goshawks, kestrels, and kites. Other animals include wildebeest, springbok, gemsbok and other antelopes, porcupines (*Hystrix africaeaustralis*), and ostriches (*Struthio camelus*).[17]\n\n\nSome of the areas within the Kalahari are seasonal wetlands, such as the Makgadikgadi Pans of Botswana. This area, for example, supports numerous halophilic species, and in the rainy season, tens of thousands of flamingos visit these pans.[18]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn an area of about 600,000\u00a0km2 in the south and west of the Kalahari, the vegetation is mainly xeric savanna. This area is the ecoregion identified by World Wide Fund for Nature as Kalahari xeric savanna AT1309. Typical savanna grasses include *Schmidtia*, *Stipagrostis*, *Aristida*, and *Eragrostis*; these are interspersed with trees such as camelthorn (*Acacia erioloba*), grey camelthorn (*Acacia haematoxylon*), shepherd's tree (*Boscia albitrunca*), blackthorn (*Acacia mellifera*), and silver cluster-leaf (*Terminalia sericea*).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe biggest threat to wildlife are the fences erected to manage herds of grazing cattle, which also removes the plant cover of the savanna itself. Cattle ranchers will also poison or hunt down predators from the rangeland, particularly targeting jackals and wild dogs.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n* ![Oryx gazella](image)\n\nOryx gazella\n* ![A meerkat in the Kalahari](image)\n\nA meerkat in the Kalahari\n* ![The endangered African wild dog in Central Kalahari Game Reserve](image)\n\nThe endangered African wild dog in Central Kalahari Game Reserve\n\n\n## Protected areas[edit]\n\n\nThe following protected areas were established in the Kalahari:\n\n\n\n* Central Kalahari Game Reserve\n* Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park\n* Khutse Game Reserve\n* Tswalu Kalahari\n\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn certain areas where the climate is drier, it becomes a true semi-desert with ground not entirely covered by vegetation: \"open\" as opposed to \"closed\" vegetation. Examples include the north of the ZF Mgcawu District Municipality, itself in the north of South Africa, and the Keetmanshoop Rural in the southeast of Namibia. In the north and east, dry forests cover an area of over 300,000\u00a0km2 in which Rhodesian teak and several species of acacia are prominent. These regions are termed Kalahari Acacia-Baikiaea woodlands AT0709.[16]\n\n\nOutside the Kalahari \"desert\", but in the Kalahari basin, halophytic vegetation to the north is adapted to pans, lakes that are completely dry during the dry season, and maybe for years during droughts, such as in Etosha (Etosha Pan halophytics AT0902) and Makgadikgadi (Zambezian halophytics AT0908).[16]\n\n\nA totally different vegetation is adapted to the perennial fresh water of the Okavango Delta, an ecoregion termed Zambezian flooded grasslands AT0907.[16]\n\n\n\n## Fauna[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)\nKalahari in Namibia\n![](image)\nBird's eye view of the Kalahari in Namibia: the darker dots are camel thorns\n![](image)\nKalahari claypan near Onderombapa\n\nDrainage of the desert is by dry black valleys, seasonally inundated pans, and the large salt pans of the Makgadikgadi Pan in Botswana and Etosha Pan in Namibia. The only permanent river, the Okavango, flows into a delta in the northwest, forming marshes that are rich in wildlife. Ancient dry riverbeds\u2014called omuramba\u2014traverse the central northern reaches of the Kalahari and provide standing pools of water during the rainy season.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSemi-arid sandy savanna in Southern Africa\n\n\"Kalahari\" redirects here.

The main region that lacks ground cover is in the southwest Kalahari (southeast of Namibia, northwest of South Africa, and southwest of Botswana) in the south of the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park. For instance, in the ZF Mgcawu District Municipality of South Africa, total vegetation cover may be as low as 30.72% on non-protected (from cattle grazing) farmlands south of Twee Rivieren Rest Camp and 37.74% in the protected (from cattle grazing) South African side of the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park:[15] these southernmost Kalahari xeric savanna areas are truly semi-deserts. However, in all the remaining Kalahari, except on salt pans during the dry season, the vegetation cover can be denser, up to almost 100%, in some limited areas.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)San man collecting devil's claw (2017)\nThe San people have lived in the Kalahari for 20,000 years as hunter-gatherers.[19] They hunt wild game with bows and poison arrows and gather edible plants, such as berries, melons and nuts, as well as insects. The San get most of their water requirements from plant roots and desert melons found on or under the desert floor. They often store water in the blown-out shells of ostrich eggs. The San live in huts built from local materials\u2014the frame is made of branches, and the roof is thatched with long grass. Most of their hunting and gathering techniques replicate pre-historic tribes. Bantu-speaking Tswana, Kgalagadi, and Herero and a small number of European settlers also live in the Kalahari desert. The city of Windhoek is situated in the Kalahari Basin.\n\n\n\n## Kalahari, San and diamonds[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Ancestral land conflict in Botswana\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n*Kalahari* is derived from the Tswana word *Kgala*, meaning \"the great thirst\", or *Kgalagadi*, meaning \"a waterless place\";[1] the Kalahari has vast areas covered by red sand without any permanent surface water.\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | This section **needs expansion**.

Such reserves may partly be the residues of ancient lakes; the Kalahari Desert was once a much wetter place. The ancient Lake Makgadikgadi dominated the area, covering the Makgadikgadi Pan and surrounding areas, but it drained or dried out some 10,000 years ago. It may have once covered as much as 120,000 square kilometres (46,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).[10] In ancient times, there was sufficient moisture for farming, with dikes and dams collecting the water. These are now filled with sediment, breached, or no longer in use, though they can be readily seen via Google Earth.[11]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"The Kalahari-Basin\". 15 July 2010.
