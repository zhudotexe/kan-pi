Such studies continued to be published even recently, such as in 1996,[56] 2001,[57] 2007,[18] and 2008,[58] where various authors identified the snowcapped 5,597 m (18,363 ft) Nevado Mismi peak, located roughly 160 km (99 mi) west of Lake Titicaca and 700 km (430 mi) southeast of Lima, as the most distant source of the river. From that point, Quebrada Carhuasanta emerges from Nevado Mismi, joins Quebrada Apacheta and soon forms Río Lloqueta which becomes Río Hornillos and eventually joins the Río Apurímac.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nObtaining these measurements was difficult given the class IV–V nature of each of these rivers, especially in their lower \"Abyss\" sections. Ultimately, they determined that the most distant point in the Mantaro drainage is nearly 80 km farther upstream compared to Mt. Mismi in the Apurímac drainage, and thus the maximal length of the Amazon river is about 80 km longer than previously thought. Contos continued downstream to the ocean and finished the first complete descent of the Amazon river from its newly identified source (finishing November 2012), a journey repeated by two groups after the news spread.[59]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nA 2014 study by Americans James Contos and Nicolas Tripcevich in *Area*, a peer-reviewed journal of the Royal Geographical Society, however, identifies the most distant source of the Amazon as actually being in the Río Mantaro drainage.[21] A variety of methods were used to compare the lengths of the Mantaro river vs. the Apurímac river from their most distant source points to their confluence, showing the longer length of the Mantaro. Then distances from Lago Junín to several potential source points in the uppermost Mantaro river were measured, which enabled them to determine that the Cordillera Rumi Cruz was the most distant source of water in the Mantaro basin (and therefore in the entire Amazon basin). The most accurate measurement method was direct GPS measurement obtained by kayak descent of each of the rivers from their source points to their confluence (performed by Contos). \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n18. 1,130 km (702 mi) – Madre de Dios, Peru/Bolivia (tributary of Madeira)\n19. 1,100 km (684 mi) – Huallaga, Peru (tributary of Marañón)\n\n\n### List by inflow to the Amazon[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Rank | Name | Average annual discharge (m^3/s) | % of Amazon\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Amazon | 209,000 | 100%\n |\n| 1 | Madeira | 31,200 | 15%\n |\n| 2 | Negro | 28,400 | 14%\n |\n| 3 | Japurá | 18,620 | 9%\n |\n| 4 | Marañón | 16,708 | 8%\n |\n| 5 | Tapajós | 13,540 | 6%\n |\n| 6 | Ucayali | 13,500 | 5%\n |\n| 7 | Purus | 10,970 | 5%\n |\n| 8 | Xingu | 9,680 | 5%\n |\n| 9 | Putumayo | 8,760 | 4%\n |\n| 10 | Juruá | 8,440 | 4%\n |\n| 11 | Napo | 6,976 | 3%\n |\n| 12 | Javari | 4,545 | 2%\n |\n| 13 | Trombetas | 3,437 | 2%\n |\n| 14 | Jutaí | 3,425 | 2%\n |\n| 15 | Abacaxis | 2,930 | 2%\n |\n| 16 | Uatumã | 2,190 | 1%\n |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Geography portal\n* ![flag](image)Brazil portal\n* ![flag](image)Colombia portal\n* ![flag](image)Peru portal\n\n\n* Amazon natural region, in Colombia\n* Peruvian Amazonia in Peru\n* Nile\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n## External links[edit]\n\n\n**Amazon river** at Wikipedia's sister projects\n\n* ![](image)Media from Commons\n* ![](image)Texts from Wikisource\n* ![](image)Travel information from Wikivoyage\n* ![](image)Data from Wikidata\n\n* Information on the Amazon from Extreme Science\n* A photographic journey up the Amazon River from its mouth to its source\n* Amazon Alive: Light & Shadow documentary film about the Amazon river\n* Amazon River Ecosystem\n* Research on the influence of the Amazon River on the Atlantic Ocean at the University of Southern California\n* ![](image) Geographic data related to Amazon River at OpenStreetMap\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nTreasures of Colombia\n |\n| --- |\n| * Archaeological sites\n* Colombia magia salvaje\n* National monuments\n* National parks\n* World Heritage sites\n |\n| \n\n| Heritage of humanity\n |\n| --- |\n| \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Bolívar | * Cartagena\n* Mompox\n |\n\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n| National heritage\n |\n| --- |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_LbyQH1BYyr2gbx7y9gW3gbQZ","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

Winter winds blow south, up river, so ships could sail up river using sails and down river using the flow of the river. While most Egyptians still live in the Nile valley, the 1970 completion of the Aswan Dam ended the summer floods and their renewal of the fertile soil, fundamentally changing farming practices. The Nile supports much of the population living along its banks, enabling Egyptians to live in otherwise inhospitable regions of the Sahara. The river's flow is disturbed at several points by the Cataracts of the Nile which form an obstacle to navigation by boats. The Sudd also forms a formidable navigation obstacle and impedes water flow, to the extent that Sudan had once attempted to build the Jonglei Canal to bypass the swamp.[81][82]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe English name *Nile* and the Arabic names *en-Nîl* and *an-Nîl* both derive from the Latin **Nilus** and the Ancient Greek Νεῖλος.[18][19] Beyond that, however, the etymology is disputed.[19][20] Homer called the river Αἴγυπτος, *Aiguptos*, but in subsequent periods, Greek authors referred to its lower course as *Neilos*; this term became generalised for the entire river system.[21] Thus, the name may derive from Ancient Egyptian expression *n*ꜣ *r*ꜣ*w-ḥ*ꜣ*w(t)* (lit. 'the mouths of the front parts'), which referred specifically to the branches of the Nile transversing the Delta, and would have been pronounced *ni-lo-he* in the area around Memphis in the 8th century BCE.[21] Hesiod at his *Theogony* refers to Nilus (Νεῖλος) as one of the Potamoi (river gods), son of Oceanus and Tethys.[22]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n29. **^** \"Bridging the Gap in the Nile Waters Dispute\". *Crisis Group*. 20 March 2019.

Ben Kozel, Tim Cope, Colin Angus and Remy Quinter were on this team. Both Kozel and Angus wrote books detailing this expedition,[24] and a documentary was produced for National Geographic Television.\n\n\nA canal inclined plane was built on the river in 1985 at the Krasnoyarsk Dam.[25]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Yenisey basin (excluding Lake Baikal and lakes of the Khantayka headwaters) is home to 55 native fish species, including two endemics: *Gobio sibiricus* (a gobionine cyprinid) and *Thymallus nigrescens* (a grayling).[17] The grayling is restricted to Khövsgöl Nuur and its tributaries.[17] Most fish found in the Yenisey basin are relatively widespread Euro-Siberian or Siberian species, such as northern pike (*Esox lucius*), common roach (*Rutilus rutilus*), common dace (*Leuciscus leuciscus*), Siberian sculpin (*Cottus poecilopus*), European perch (*Perca fluviatilis*) and Prussian carp (*Carassius gibelio*). The basin is also home to many salmonids (trout, whitefish, charr, graylings, taimen and relatives) and the Siberian sturgeon (*Acipenser baerii*).[17]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Inclined plane at Krasnoyarsk Dam\nRiver steamers first came to the Yenisey River in 1864 and were brought in from Holland and England across the icy Kara Sea. One was the SS Nikolai. The SS Thames attempted to explore the river, overwintered in 1876, but was damaged in the ice and eventually wrecked in the river. Success came with the steamers Frazer, Express in 1878, and the next year, Moscow hauling supplies in and wheat out. The Dalman reached Yeniseisk in 1881.\n\n\nImperial Russia placed river steamers on the massive river in an attempt to free up communication with land-locked Siberia. One boat was the SS St. Nicholas which took the future Tsar Nicholas II on his voyage to Siberia, and later conveyed Vladimir Lenin to prison.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNomadic tribes such as the Ket people and the Yugh people have lived along the banks of the Yenisey since ancient times, and this region is the location of the Yeniseian language family. The Ket, numbering about 1000, are the only survivors today of those who originally lived throughout central southern Siberia near the river banks. Their extinct relatives included the Kotts, Assans, Arins, Baikots and Pumpokols who lived further upriver to the south. The modern Ket lived in the eastern middle areas of the river before being assimilated politically into Russia during the 17th through 19th centuries.[26]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_8QjNCrkbw8aO2Gi3ZztWziws","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

From Yibin to Yichang, the river through Sichuan and Chongqing Municipality is also known as the *Chuān Jiāng* (川江) or \"Sichuan River.\" In Hubei, the river is also called the *Jīng Jiāng* (荆江; 荊江) or the \"Jing River\" after Jingzhou, one of the Nine Provinces of ancient China. In Anhui, the river takes on the local name *Wǎn Jiāng* after the shorthand name for Anhui, *wǎn* (皖). And *Yángzǐ Jiāng* (揚子江; 扬子江) or the \"Yangzi River\", from which the English name Yangtze is derived, is the local name for the Lower Yangtze in the region of Yangzhou. The name likely comes from an ancient ferry crossing called *Yángzǐ* or *Yángzǐjīn* (揚子 / 揚子津).[19] Europeans who arrived in the Yangtze River Delta region applied this local name to the whole river.[14] The dividing site between upstream and midstream is considered to be at Yichang and that between midstream and downstream at Hukou (Jiujiang).[20]\n\n\n\n### English[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_LyEYjCPdtzmbRPbrtYv3II0T","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

Although the Dangqu (or Dam Chu) is the geographic source of the Yangtze River, the Ulan Moron has been traditionally regarded as the main river. With its location in Inner Asia, it therefore belongs to the East China Sea watershed basin.\n\n\nIt begins as melt-off from the Geladandong glaciers and runs to a confluence with the Dangqu, where they form the Tongtian River.\n\n\nIn Chinese, the character 河 originally described the Yellow River and 江 the Yangtze.

From its confluence with the St. Croix River downstream to Dubuque, Iowa, the river is entrenched, with high bedrock bluffs lying on either side. The height of these bluffs decreases to the south of Dubuque, though they are still significant through Savanna, Illinois. This topography contrasts strongly with the Lower Mississippi, which is a meandering river in a broad, flat area, only rarely flowing alongside a bluff (as at Vicksburg, Mississippi).\n\n\n\n![](image)The confluence of the Mississippi (left) and Ohio (right) rivers at Cairo, Illinois, the demarcation between the Middle and the Lower Mississippi River\n### Middle Mississippi[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAt its source at Lake Itasca, the Mississippi River is about 3 feet (0.91 m) deep. The average depth of the Mississippi River between Saint Paul and Saint Louis is between 9 and 12 feet (2.7–3.7 m) deep, the deepest part being Lake Pepin, which averages 20–32 feet (6–10 m) deep and has a maximum depth of 60 feet (18 m). Between where the Missouri River joins the Mississippi at Saint Louis, Missouri, and Cairo, Illinois, the depth averages 30 feet (9 m). Below Cairo, where the Ohio River joins, the depth averages 50–100 feet (15–30 m) deep. The deepest part of the river is in New Orleans, where it reaches 200 feet (61 m) deep.[56][57]\n\n\n\n## Cultural geography[edit]\n\n\n### State boundaries[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Mississippi River is known as the Middle Mississippi from the Upper Mississippi River's confluence with the Missouri River at St. Louis, Missouri, for 190 miles (310 km) to its confluence with the Ohio River at Cairo, Illinois.[32][33]\n\n\nThe Middle Mississippi is relatively free-flowing. From St. Louis to the Ohio River confluence, the Middle Mississippi falls 220 feet (67 m) over 180 miles (290 km) for an average rate of 1.2 feet per mile (23 cm/km). At its confluence with the Ohio River, the Middle Mississippi is 315 feet (96 m) above sea level. Apart from the Missouri and Meramec rivers of Missouri and the Kaskaskia River of Illinois, no major tributaries enter the Middle Mississippi River.\n\n\n\n### Lower Mississippi[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Lower Mississippi River\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBy the time the Upper Mississippi reaches Saint Paul, Minnesota, below Lock and Dam No. 1, it has dropped more than half its original elevation and is 687 feet (209 m) above sea level. From St. Paul to St. Louis, Missouri, the river elevation falls much more slowly and is controlled and managed as a series of pools created by 26 locks and dams.[31]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The source of the Mississippi River at Lake Itasca\n![A log bridge over a very small river on an autumnal, cloudy day with flurries of snow](image)The first bridge (and only log bridge) over the Mississippi, about 25 feet south of its source at Lake Itasca\n![St. Anthony Falls](image)Former head of navigation, St. Anthony Falls, Minneapolis, Minnesota\n![](image)Confluence of the Wisconsin and Mississippi rivers, viewed from Wyalusing State Park in Wisconsin\nThe Upper Mississippi runs from its headwaters to its confluence with the Missouri River at St. Louis, Missouri.

The name *Itasca* was chosen to designate the \"true head\" of the Mississippi River as a combination of the last four letters of the Latin word for truth (*ver**itas***) and the first two letters of the Latin word for head (***ca**put*).[28] However, the lake is in turn fed by a number of smaller streams.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n28. **^** Upham, Warren. \"Minnesota Place Names: A Geographical Encyclopedia\".

Although the plains of the watershed have extremely little local vertical relief, the land rises about 10 feet per mile (1.9 m/km) from east to west. The elevation is less than 500 feet (150 m) at the eastern border of the watershed, but is over 3,000 feet (910 m) above sea level in many places at the base of the Rockies.[17]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \nThe Missouri's flow at Culbertson, Montana, 25 mi (40 km) above the confluence of the two rivers, is about 9,820 cu ft/s (278 m3/s)[18] and the Yellowstone's discharge at Sidney, Montana, roughly the same distance upstream along that river, is about 12,370 cu ft/s (350 m3/s).[19]\n2. **^** \nThe Mississippi River flows for approximately 1,172 miles (1,886 km) above St. Louis,[17] which is just over half of the Missouri's length.\n3. **^** \nThe Mississippi drains an area of 172,200 sq mi (446,000 km2) above the confluence with the Missouri River.[14]\n4. **^** \n\"Long Pool\" is the name used by area residents to refer to the smooth, almost lake-like 55 mi (89 km) stretch of the Missouri between the Black Eagle Dam and the town of Cascade. Only about 2 mi (3.2 km) of the so-called Long Pool are actually part of the impoundment behind the dam.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* \"Missouri River\".
