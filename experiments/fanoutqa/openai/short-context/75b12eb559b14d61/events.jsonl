Aldrin heard that Armstrong would be the first because Armstrong was a civilian, which made Aldrin livid. Aldrin attempted to persuade other lunar module pilots he should be first, but they responded cynically about what they perceived as a lobbying campaign. Attempting to stem interdepartmental conflict, Slayton told Aldrin that Armstrong would be first since he was the commander. The decision was announced in a press conference on April 14, 1969.[94]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Apollo 11** (July 16–24, 1969) was the American spaceflight that first landed humans on the Moon. Commander Neil Armstrong and Lunar Module Pilot Buzz Aldrin landed the Apollo Lunar Module *Eagle* on July 20, 1969, at 20:17 UTC, and Armstrong became the first person to step onto the Moon's surface six hours and 39 minutes later, on July 21 at 02:56 UTC. Aldrin joined him 19 minutes later, and they spent about two and a quarter hours together exploring the site they had named Tranquility Base upon landing. Armstrong and Aldrin collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material to bring back to Earth as pilot Michael Collins flew the Command Module *Columbia* in lunar orbit, and were on the Moon's surface for 21 hours, 36 minutes before lifting off to rejoin *Columbia*.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn July 20, 2009, Armstrong, Aldrin, and Collins met with US President Barack Obama at the White House.[263] \"We expect that there is, as we speak, another generation of kids out there who are looking up at the sky and are going to be the next Armstrong, Collins, and Aldrin\", Obama said. \"We want to make sure that NASA is going to be there for them when they want to take their journey.\"[264] On August 7, 2009, an act of Congress awarded the three astronauts a Congressional Gold Medal, the highest civilian award in the United States. The bill was sponsored by Florida Senator Bill Nelson and Florida Representative Alan Grayson.[265][266]\n\n\nA group of British scientists interviewed as part of the anniversary events reflected on the significance of the Moon landing:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAldrin shoveled 6 kilograms (13 lb) of soil into the box of rocks in order to pack them in tightly.[158] Two types of rocks were found in the geological samples: basalt and breccia.[159] Three new minerals were discovered in the rock samples collected by the astronauts: armalcolite, tranquillityite, and pyroxferroite. Armalcolite was named after Armstrong, Aldrin, and Collins. All have subsequently been found on Earth.[160]\n\n\n\n![](image)The plaque left on the ladder of *Eagle*\nWhile on the surface, Armstrong uncovered a plaque mounted on the LM ladder, bearing two drawings of Earth (of the Western and Eastern Hemispheres), an inscription, and signatures of the astronauts and President Nixon. The inscription read:\n\n\n\n\n> Here men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the Moon July 1969, A. D. We came in peace for all mankind.[15]\n> \n> \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Ticker tape parade in New York City\nOn August 13, the three astronauts rode in ticker-tape parades in their honor in New York and Chicago, with an estimated six million attendees.[206][207] On the same evening in Los Angeles there was an official state dinner to celebrate the flight, attended by members of Congress, 44 governors, Chief Justice of the United States Warren E. Burger and his predecessor, Earl Warren, and ambassadors from 83 nations at the Century Plaza Hotel. Nixon and Agnew honored each astronaut with a presentation of the Presidential Medal of Freedom.[206][208]\n\n\nThe three astronauts spoke before a joint session of Congress on September 16, 1969. They presented two US flags, one to the House of Representatives and the other to the Senate, that they had carried with them to the surface of the Moon.[209] The flag of American Samoa on Apollo 11 is on display at the Jean P. Haydon Museum in Pago Pago, the capital of American Samoa.[210]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n276. **^** Dunn, Marcia (July 19, 2019). \"Apollo 11 astronauts reunite on 50th anniversary of moonshot\". *ABC*.

On July 13, three days before Apollo 11's launch, the Soviet Union launched Luna 15, which reached lunar orbit before Apollo 11. During descent, a malfunction caused Luna 15 to crash in Mare Crisium about two hours before Armstrong and Aldrin took off from the Moon's surface to begin their voyage home. The Nuffield Radio Astronomy Laboratories radio telescope in England recorded transmissions from Luna 15 during its descent, and these were released in July 2009 for the 40th anniversary of Apollo 11.[49]\n\n\n\n## Personnel[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) |\n| Part of a series on |\n| Apollo 11 |\n| * **Crew**\n\t+ Neil Armstrong · Buzz Aldrin · Michael Collins\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Aldrin, Buzz; Abraham, Ken (2016). *No Dream is Too High: Life Lessons from a Man who Walked on the Moon*.

After Starship HLS reaches NRHO, SLS/Orion will send the Orion spacecraft with a crew of four to rendezvous and dock with HLS.[b] Two astronauts will transfer to HLS, which will descend to the lunar surface and spend about 6.5 days on the surface. The astronauts will perform at least two EVAs on the surface before the HLS ascends to return them to a rendezvous with Orion. Orion will return the four astronauts to Earth. Launch is scheduled no earlier than December 2025.[19][20]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n79. **^** Werner, Debra (24 May 2018). \"NASA to begin buying rides on commercial lunar landers by year's end\". *spacenews.com*.
