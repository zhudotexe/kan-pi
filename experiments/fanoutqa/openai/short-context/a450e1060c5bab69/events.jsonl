Liu claims Hewlett-Packard as a key source of inspiration. In an interview with *The Economist* he stated that \"Our earliest and best teacher was Hewlett-Packard.\" For more than ten years, Lenovo was Hewlett-Packard's distributor in China.[188] In reference to Lenovo's later acquisition of IBM's personal computer unit Liu said, \"I remember the first time I took part in a meeting of IBM agents. I was wearing an old business suit of my father's and I sat in the back row. Even in my dreams, I never imagined that one day we could buy the IBM PC business. It was unthinkable.

The Chinese name (simplified Chinese: 联想; traditional Chinese: 聯想; pinyin: *Liánxiǎngⓘ*) means \"association\" (as in \"association of ideas\"), \"associative thinking\", or \"connected thinking\". It also implies creativity.[75] \"Lianxiang\" was first used to refer to a layout of Chinese typewriters in the 1950s organized into groups of common words and phrases rather than the standard dictionary layout.[76]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Yang Yuanqing, Lenovo's Chairman and CEO\nYang Yuanqing is the chairman and chief executive officer of Lenovo. One of his major achievements was leading Lenovo to become the best-selling personal computer brand in China since 1997. In 2001, *Bloomberg Businessweek* named him one of Asia's rising stars in business.[182] Yang was president and CEO of Lenovo until 2004, when Lenovo closed its acquisition of IBM's PC division, after which Yang was succeeded as Lenovo CEO by IBM's Stephen M. Ward Jr. Ward was succeeded by William Amelio on 20 December 2005. In February 2009, Yang replaced Amelio as CEO and has served in that capacity ever since. Yang was chairman of Lenovo's board from 2004 to 2008, and returned as chairman in 2012 alongside his role as CEO.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLenovo is a manufacturer of personal computers, smartphones, televisions, and wearable devices. Some of the company's earliest products included the KT8920 mainframe computer[10] and a circuit board that allowed IBM-compatible personal computers to process Chinese characters.[14] One of its first computers was the Tianxi (天禧), released in 1998 in the Chinese market. It became the best selling computer in Chinese history in 2000.[17]\n\n\n\n### Personal and business computing[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nTo fund its continued growth, Lenovo issued a secondary offering of 50 million shares on the Hong Kong market in March 2000 and raised about US$212 million.[10] It rebranded to the name Lenovo in 2003 and began making acquisitions to expand the company.[15]\n\n\nLenovo acquired IBM's personal computer business in 2005, including the ThinkPad laptop and ThinkCentre desktop lines.[18] Lenovo's acquisition of IBM's personal computer division accelerated access to foreign markets while improving Lenovo's branding and technology.[19] Lenovo paid US$1.25 billion for IBM's computer business and assumed an additional US$500 million of IBM's debt.

On its first day of trading, the company's stock price hit a high of HK$2.07 and closed at HK$2.00 suggesting an initial under-valuing of the company. Proceeds from the offering were used to finance sales offices in Europe, North America and Australia, to expand and improve production and research and development, and to increase working capital.[10]\n\n\nBy 1996, Lenovo was the market leader in China and began selling its own laptop.[15] By 1998 it held 43 per cent of the domestic computer market share in China, selling approximately one million computers.[15]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Current | * Lenovo Vibe\n\t+ K4 Note\n\t+ P1\n\t+ X\n\t+ Z\n\t+ Z2 Pro\n* Lenovo\n\t+ K6 Power\n\t+ K12\n\t\t- Pro\n\t\t- Note\n\t+ K13\n\t\t- Note\n\t+ P2\n\t+ Phab 2 Pro\n\t+ Lenovo Z Series\n\t\t- Z2 Plus\n* IdeaPhone\n\t+ K900\n\t+ A820\n* Legion Duel\n\t+ 2\n* LePhone\n |\n| Discontinued | * Skylight\n |\n\n |\n\n |\n| Other | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Software | * ThinkShield\n* ThinkVantage\n* VeriFace\n |\n| Technologies | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Current | * PrivacyGuard\n* ThinkShutter\n |\n| Discontinued | * UltraBay\n* ThinkLight\n |\n\n |\n| Displaysand television sets | * ThinkVision\n* LeTV\n |\n| Smart speakers | * Smart Assistant\n |\n\n |\n| Acquisitions | * LenovoEMC\n* Medion\n* Motorola Mobility\n* ZUK Mobile\n* IBM PC business\n |\n| Other | * Legend Holdings\n* Liu Chuanzhi (founder)\n* Yang Yuanqing (CEO, 2009–)\n* William Amelio (CEO, 2005–09)\n |\n| * ![](image) **Category**\n* ![](image) **Commons**\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe name for the company agreed upon at this meeting was the Chinese Academy of Sciences Computer Technology Research Institute New Technology Development Company.[10] Lenovo has increasingly diversified from the personal computer market and made a number of corporate acquisitions, with the most notable being acquiring and integrating most of IBM's personal computer business and its x86-based server business as well as creating its own smartphone.[13]\n\n\nThe organizational structure of the company was established in 1985 after the Chinese New Year. It included technology, engineering, administrative, and office departments.[10] The group first attempted to import televisions but failed. It rebuilt itself as a company doing quality checks on computers. It also tried and failed to market a digital watch.[14]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn early 2013, Lenovo announced the addition of Yahoo! founder Jerry Yang to its board.[189] Lenovo's CEO Yang Yuanqing said, \"Jerry's appointment as an observer to our board furthers Lenovo's reputation as a transparent international company.\" Just prior to the appointment of Jerry Yang, Tudor Brown, the founder of British semiconductor design firm ARM, was also appointed to Lenovo's board. Speaking of both men Yang Yuanqing said, \"We believe that they will add a great deal to our strategic thinking, long-term direction and, ultimately, our ability to achieve our aspirations in the PC plus era.\"\n\n\n\n## Marketing and sponsorships[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n173. **^** \"Lenovo added to Hang Seng index, Chalco out\". *reuters.com*. 6 February 2013.

The company developed computers featuring innovative graphical user interfaces, including the 1984 original Macintosh, announced that year in a critically acclaimed advertisement called \"1984\".

Jobs often walked around the office barefoot even after Apple became a Fortune 500 company. By the time of the \"1984\" television advertisement, Apple's informal culture had become a key trait that differentiated it from its competitors.[258] According to a 2011 report in *Fortune*, this has resulted in a corporate culture more akin to a startup rather than a multinational corporation.[259] In a 2017 interview, Wozniak credited watching *Star Trek* and attending *Star Trek* conventions in his youth as inspiration for co-founding Apple.[260]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs the company has grown and been led by a series of differently opinionated chief executives, it has arguably lost some of its original character.

The HP 2640 series of smart and intelligent terminals introduced forms-based interfaces to ASCII terminals, and also introduced screen labeled function keys, now commonly used on gas pumps and bank ATMs. The HP 2640 series included one of the first bit mapped graphics displays that, when combined with the HP 2100 21MX F-Series microcoded Scientific Instruction Set,[21] enabled the first commercial WYSIWYG presentation program, BRUNO, that later became the program HP-Draw on the HP 3000. Although scoffed at in the formative days of computing, HP surpassed IBM as the world's largest technology vendor in terms of sales.[22]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1942, they built their first building at 395 Page Mill Road and were awarded the Army-Navy \"E\" Award in 1943. HP employed 200 people and produced the audio oscillator, a wave analyzer, distortion analyzers, an audio-signal generator, and the Model 400A vacuum-tube voltmeter during the war.[13]: 54–60, 195\n\n\nHewlett and Packard worked on counter-radar technology and artillery shell proximity fuzes during World War II; the work exempted Packard from the draft,[14] but Hewlett had to serve as an officer in the Army Signal Corps after being called to active duty.\n\n\nHP was incorporated on August 18, 1947, with Packard as president. Sales reached $5.5 million in 1951 with 215 employees. The company went public on November 6, 1957.[13]: 35, 40, 64, 70, 196 In 1959, a manufacturing plant was established in Böblingen and a marketing organization in Geneva.[13]: 196 Packard handed the presidency over to Hewlett when he became chairman in 1964, but remained CEO of the company.\n\n\n\n### 1960s[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSales reached $6.5 billion in 1985 with 85,000 employees.[13]: 198\n\n\nIn 1984, HP introduced both inkjet and laser printers for the desktop. Along with its scanner product line, the printers have later been developed into successful multifunction products, the most significant being single-unit printer/scanner/copier/fax machines. The print mechanisms in HP's LaserJet line of laser printers depend almost entirely on Canon Inc.'s components (print engines), which in turn use technology developed by Xerox. HP developed the hardware, firmware, and software to convert data into dots for printing.[27]\n\n\nOn March 3, 1986, HP registered the HP.com domain name, making it the ninth Internet .com domain to be registered.[28]\n\n\nIn 1987, the Palo Alto garage where Hewlett and Packard started their business was designated as a California Historical Landmark.\n\n\n\n### 1990s[edit]\n\n\n\n![Logo with \"Invent\" tagline introduced in 1999[29]](image)Logo with \"Invent\" tagline introduced in 1999[29]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the 1990s, HP expanded their computer product line, which initially had been targeted at university, research, and business users, to reach consumers. HP also grew through acquisitions: it bought Apollo Computer in 1989 and Convex Computer in 1995.\n\n\nIn 1992, Young was succeeded by Lewis E. Platt, and in 1993 and Hewlett and Packard stepped down from the board with Platt succeeding Packard as chairman.\n\n\nIn 1993, HP acquired Advanced Design System from Pathwave. The ADS suite of RF simulation tools was spun off into Agilent in 1999 along with related T&M business units, all of which were carried forward into the spinoff of Agilent into Keysight.\n\n\nLater in the decade, HP opened hpshopping.com as an independent subsidiary to sell online, direct to consumers; in 2005, the store was renamed \"HP Home & Home Office Store\".\n\n\nFrom 1995 to 1998, Hewlett-Packard were sponsors of the English football team Tottenham Hotspur.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAmerican information technology company (1939–2015)\n\nThis article is about the original company that existed from 1939 to 2015.

In July, Michael Dell stepped aside as chief executive officer while retaining his position as chairman of the board.[31] Kevin Rollins, who had held a number of executive posts at Dell, became the new CEO. Despite no longer holding the CEO title, Dell essentially acted as a de facto co-CEO with Rollins.[29]\n\n\nUnder Rollins, Dell purchased the computer hardware manufacturer Alienware in 2006. Dell Inc.'s plan anticipated Alienware continuing to operate independently under its existing management. Alienware expected to benefit from Dell's efficient manufacturing system.[32]\n\n\n\n### Key events[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n38. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Haff, Gordon (March 29, 2010). \"The real Dell 2.0 | The Pervasive Data Center – CNET News\". *CNET*.

In 1992, *Fortune* included Dell Computer Corporation in its list of the world's 500 largest companies, making Michael Dell the youngest CEO of a Fortune 500 company at that time.\n\n\nIn 1993, to complement its own direct sales channel, Dell planned to sell PCs at big-box retail outlets such as Wal-Mart, which would have brought in an additional $125 million (equivalent to $238,100,000 in 2023) in annual revenue. Bain consultant Kevin Rollins persuaded Michael Dell to pull out of these deals, believing they would be money losers in the long run.[25] Margins at retail were thin at best and Dell left the reseller channel in 1994.[26] Rollins would soon join Dell full-time and eventually become the company president and CEO.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDell is a subsidiary of Dell Technologies, Inc., a publicly traded company (Nasdaq: DELL), as well as a component of the NASDAQ-100 and S&P 500.

It is the second-largest non-oil company in Texas.[13][14]\n\n\nIn 2015, Dell acquired the enterprise technology firm EMC Corporation. Dell and EMC became divisions of Dell Technologies. Dell EMC sells data storage, information security, virtualization, analytics, and cloud computing.[15]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn May 2013, Michael Dell joined his board in voting for the offer.[95] The following August he reached a deal with the special committee on the board for $13.88 per share, a raised price of $13.75 plus a special dividend of 13 cents, as well as a change to the voting rules.[96] The $13.88 cash offer (plus a $.08 per share dividend for the third fiscal quarter) was accepted on September 12[97] and closed on October 30, 2013, ending Dell's 25-year run as a publicly-traded company.\n\n\nAfter the buyout, the newly private Dell offered a Voluntary Separation Program that they expected to reduce their workforce by up to seven percent. The reception to the program so exceeded the expectations that Dell may be forced to hire new staff to make up for the losses.[98]\n\n\n\n### Recent history[edit]\n\n\nOn November 19, 2015, Dell, alongside ARM Holdings, Cisco Systems, Intel, Microsoft, and Princeton University, founded the OpenFog Consortium, to promote interests and development in fog computing.[99]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Dell Inc.** is an American based technology company.
