He always acted in consultation with Page and Brin when he embarked on initiatives such as the hiring of an executive team and the creation of a sales force management system. Page remained the boss at Google in the eyes of the employees, as he gave final approval on all new hires, and it was Page who provided the signature for the IPO, the latter making him a billionaire at the age of 30.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n> \"The pair's mission was 'to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful.\"[53] With a US$1-million loan from friends and family, the inaugural team moved into a Mountain View office by the start of 2000.
