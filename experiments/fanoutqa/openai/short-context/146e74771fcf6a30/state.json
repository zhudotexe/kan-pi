He always acted in consultation with Page and Brin when he embarked on initiatives such as the hiring of an executive team and the creation of a sales force management system. Page remained the boss at Google in the eyes of the employees, as he gave final approval on all new hires, and it was Page who provided the signature for the IPO, the latter making him a billionaire at the age of 30.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n> \"The pair's mission was 'to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful.\"[53] With a US$1-million loan from friends and family, the inaugural team moved into a Mountain View office by the start of 2000. In 1999, Page experimented with smaller servers so Google could fit more into each square meter of the third-party warehouses the company rented for their servers. This eventually led to a search engine that ran much faster than Google's competitors at the time.\"[10]\n> \n> \n\n\nBy June 2000, Google had indexed one billion Internet URLs (Uniform Resource Locators), making it the most comprehensive search engine on the Web at the time. The company cited NEC Research Institute data in its June 26 press release, stating that \"there are more than 1 billion web pages online today\", with Google \"providing access to 560 million full-text indexed web pages and 500 million partially indexed URLs.\"[54]\n\n\n\n#### Early management style[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n80. **^** Rolfe Winkler (October 27, 2014). \"In New Structure, Google CEO Page Aims for 'Faster, Better Decisions'\". *The Wall Street Journal*.
