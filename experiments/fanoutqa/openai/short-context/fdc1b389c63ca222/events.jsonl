Unlike ocean liners, they typically embark on round-trip voyages to various ports of call, where passengers may go on tours known as \"shore excursions\".[1] They may carry thousands of passengers in a single trip, and are some of the largest ships in the world by gross tonnage (GT), bigger than many cargo ships. Cruise ships started to exceed ocean liners in size and capacity in the mid-1990s;[2] before then, few were more than 50,000 GT.[3] In the decades since the size of the largest vessels has more than doubled.[4] There have been nine or more new cruise ships added every year since 2001, most of which are 100,000 GT or greater.[5] In the two decades between 1988 and 2009, the largest cruise ships grew a third longer (268 m to 360 m), almost doubled their widths (32.2 m to 60.5 m), doubled the total passengers (2,744 to 5,400), and tripled in volume (73,000 GT to 225,000 GT). \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nLargest cruise ships in service\n| Companies\n | Ships\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Royal Caribbean International | 18\n |\n| MSC Cruises | 14\n |\n| Norwegian Cruise Line | 8\n |\n| Princess Cruises | 6\n |\n| Costa Cruises | 3\n |\n| AIDA Cruises | 3\n |\n| Carnival Cruise Line | 2\n |\n| P&O Cruises | 3\n |\n| Resorts World Cruises | 1\n |\n| Celebrity Cruises | 1\n |\n| Cunard | 1\n |\n| Disney Cruise Line | 1\n |\n\n\n## On order[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAs of January 2022[update], the largest cruise ship, *Wonder of the Seas*, has a gross tonnage of 236,857, is 362 metres (1,188 ft) long, 64 metres (210 ft) wide, and holds up to 6,988 passengers.[6][7]\n\n\nCruise ships are organized much like floating hotels, with a complete hospitality staff in addition to the usual ship's crew.[8] They cater to nautical tourists, with recent vessels being described as \"balcony-laden floating condominiums\".[9] The \"megaships\" went from a single deck with verandas to all decks with verandas,[10] and feature ameneties such as theaters, fine-dining and chain restaurants, spas, fitness centers, casinos, sports facilities, and even amusement park attractions.[1][11]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* ![icon](image)Oceans portal\n* ![icon](image)Transport portal\n\n\n* List of cruise lines\n* List of largest cruise lines\n* List of cruise ships\n* List of largest passenger ships\n* List of largest ships by gross tonnage\n* List of longest ships\n* List of largest container ships\n* Timeline of largest passenger ships\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Saunders, Aaron (2013). *Giants of the seas : the ships that transformed modern cruising*.

She was completed in 2022 in the Chantiers de l'Atlantique shipyard in Saint-Nazaire, France,[5] the fifth in Royal Caribbean's *Oasis* class of cruise ships.[6] At 236,857 GT, she was the largest cruise ship in the world by gross tonnage, surpassed by the succeeding ship, *Icon of the Seas*, also owned by Royal Caribbean International.\n\n\n\n\n## Description and design[edit]\n\n\n*Wonder of the Seas* measures 1,188 feet (362 m) in length and has a gross tonnage of 236,857 across 18 decks. This ship accommodates 5,734 passengers at double occupancy or up to a maximum of 6,988 passengers, as well as a 2,300 crew. There are 16 decks for guest use, 20 restaurants, four pools and 2,867 cabins.[4]\n\n\nFacilities include a children's water park, a children's playground, a full-size basketball court, an ice-skating rink, a surf simulator, a zip line that is 10 decks high, a 1,400-seat theater, an outdoor aquatic theater with 30-foot (9.1 m) high platforms, and two 43-foot (13 m) rock-climbing walls.[7][8][9][10][11]\n\n\nAs with all *Oasis*-class ships, one of the special features on board is the Central Park, with more than 10,000 plants and flowers.[12]\n\n\n*Wonder of the Seas* is powered by six marine-diesel sets: two 16-cylinder Wärtsilä 16V46D common rail engines and four 12-cylinder Wärtsilä 12V46D engines.[1]\n\n\nFor propulsion, *Wonder of the Seas* uses three 20,000 kilowatt azipod main engines, which are electric thrusters. These engines are mounted under the stern of the ship and they each drive 20 foot wide rotatable propellers. In addition to the three electric thrusters, there are four bow thrusters used for docking, each with 5,500 kilowatts of power or 7,380 horsepower.[1]\n\n\n\n## Construction and career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*Wonder of the Seas* under construction at Saint-Nazaire in 2020\n![](image)*Wonder of the Seas* in Saint-Nazaire, August 2021\n![](image)*Wonder of the Seas* in Málaga\nOn 25 May 2016, Royal Caribbean Group signed a memorandum of understanding with STX France (now Chantiers de l'Atlantique) for a fifth *Oasis*-class ship for delivery in the spring of 2021.[13] The first steel for the new ship was cut at the Saint-Nazaire shipyard in April 2019,[14] and the vessel's keel was laid on 9 May 2019.[1] Construction cost £1 billion.[15]\n\n\nIn August 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Royal Caribbean announced that delivery of the ship would be delayed until 2022.[16]\n\n\nIn April 2021, Royal Caribbean opened bookings aboard *Wonder of the Seas* for an inaugural 2022 season sailing in Asia from ports in Shanghai and Hong Kong.[17][18] However, in September of that year, Royal Caribbean announced that the ship would instead debut at Port Everglades, sailing Caribbean cruises, before moving to the Mediterranean in the summer, sailing out of Barcelona and Rome.[19] In November 2021, the ship's livery was modified to resemble that of *Odyssey of the Seas*, with her name moved rearward and repainted in larger print.[20] The following month, Royal Caribbean announced that the ship would homeport at Port Canaveral in Florida starting in November 2022.[21]\n\n\nOn 29 October 2021, Royal Caribbean accepted the ship for \"technical delivery\", and the following week she sailed under her own power from Saint-Nazaire to a *Chantier Naval de Marseille* drydock in Marseille-Fos Port for finishing work.[22][23] On 27 January 2022, the ship was handed over to Royal Caribbean.[24][25] She arrived in North America in February 2022,[26] and commenced her maiden voyage on 4 March 2022 out of Port Everglades.[27]\n\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** ***k*** ***l*** ***m*** \"*Wonder of the Seas* (38209)\". *Vessel Register for DNV*.

With a gross tonnage of 226,963 GT,[1] she is the third largest passenger ship in the world, larger than her older sisters *Oasis of the Seas* and *Allure of the Seas*, but surpassed by her newer sisters *Symphony of the Seas* and *Wonder of the Seas*. In length, however, *Harmony of the Seas* is the longest cruise ship in the world.[17]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n*Harmony of the Seas* took two short \"preview cruises\", three nights to Cherbourg and four nights to Rotterdam, after reaching port in Southampton on 17 May.[21] During these voyages, passengers complained of ongoing construction, a lack of hot water, unopened attractions, excessive waits at restaurants, and other issues.[22] The ship's maiden voyage departed from Southampton on 29 May and arrived at its summer home port of Barcelona on 5 June. According to passengers on this cruise, construction had finished and the ship was ready to sail.[23] For the inaugural season, *Harmony of the Seas* offered seven-night western Mediterranean cruises originating from Barcelona and Civitavecchia.[24]\n\n\nOn 10 November 2016, the vessel was officially christened by her godmother, Miami-Dade County teacher Brittany Affolter.[25]\n\n\n\n## Facilities[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)*Harmony of the Seas* as she appeared when being built at STX yards in France\nThe success of the first two *Oasis*-class ships led Royal Caribbean Cruises to order a third ship of the type in December 2012.[4] *Harmony of the Seas* is named after the *Harmony* module on the International Space Station [*citation needed*]. The vessel was floated out on 19 June 2015, began her first sea trials on 10 March 2016,[18] and was delivered to Royal Caribbean on 12 May 2016.[3] After a construction time of 32 months, the ship first set sail on 15 May 2016 from the STX France docks in Saint-Nazaire, viewed by some 70,000 people.[19] Her first destination was Southampton, England, although her home port was Barcelona until 23 October 2016 when she crossed the Atlantic.[20]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** ***k*** ***l*** ***m*** ***n*** ***o*** ***p*** ***q*** \"*Harmony of the Seas* (33249)\". *Vessel Register for DNV*.

One of these is the implementation of a new system that releases tiny air bubbles under the hull to enable the vessel to glide more smoothly through the water.[23] The air layer also reduces excitation from the propellers, which cuts noise and vibration levels in the aft part of the ship.[24]\n\n\n\n## Construction and career[edit]\n\n\nOn 29 October 2015, the vessel's keel was laid by the Chantiers de l'Atlantique shipyard in Saint-Nazaire, France.[5] *Symphony of the Seas* floated out on 9 June 2017.[25] Actors Alexa Vega and Carlos Pena Jr., and their 23-month-old son Ocean were chosen as the \"Godfamily\" of the ship, marking the first time in the industry that a family was a ship sponsor.[26] The christening ceremony took place in Miami in November 2018.[27]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2020, Channel 4 in the United Kingdom aired a behind-the-scenes show featuring *Symphony of the Seas* called *Billion Pound Cruise*.[44] The three-part series was filmed at the end of 2019 and covers the on-board experiences*.*[45][46]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n44. **^** \"Billion Pound Cruise - All 4\". *www.channel4.com*.

These engines are mounted under the stern of the ship and they each drive 20 foot wide rotatable propellers. In addition to the three main engines, there are four bow thrusters used for docking, each with 5,500 kilowatts of power or 7,380 horsepower.[20]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn January 2019, while the ship was docked in Nassau, Bahamas, a guest jumped overboard as part of a stunt and survived.[35][36] He and his friends were turned over to law enforcement but were not charged, and they were required to return home at their own expense.[37] Subsequently, Royal Caribbean announced that it would permanently ban the guests from sailing on any of its ships.\n\n\nIn August 2019, an Australian passenger died after going overboard during a seven-day cruise of the Caribbean. His body was recovered shortly afterwards by the ship's officials.[38][39]\n\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic on cruise ships, Royal Caribbean suspended all services across most of its fleet, including *Symphony of the Seas*.[40][41] A 27-year old crew member from the housekeeping department was medically evacuated in March 2020 and subsequently died from COVID-19 in April 2020.[42][43] The family later sued Royal Caribbean for wrongful death.[42]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_40DdlYsG6PaONTqcgyJLJpvw","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

At this ceremony the ship was sponsored by seven \"godmothers\", each representing one of the seven neighbourhoods on board. Her godmothers are Gloria Estefan, Michelle Kwan, Dara Torres, Keshia Knight Pulliam, Shawn Johnson, Jane Seymour and Daisy Fuentes.[28]\n\n\nDuring the first float-out of the vessel the tugboats that were pulling the ship from its dock failed to control the ship, resulting in the port side of the ship hitting the dock. This resulted in some cosmetic damage and minor damage to the hull, which was repaired and did not affect the final delivery date of the vessel.[29]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n30. **^** \"Royal Caribbean's newest ship, the world's largest, makes maiden voyage\". *NJ.com*.
