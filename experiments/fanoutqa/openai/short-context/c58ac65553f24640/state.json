The president has the authority to nominate members of his Cabinet to the United States Senate for confirmation under the Appointments Clause of the United States Constitution.\n\n\nBefore confirmation and during congressional hearings, a high-level career member of an executive department heads this pre-confirmed cabinet on an acting basis. The Cabinet's creation was part of the transition of power following the 2020 United States presidential election.\n\n\nIn addition to the 15 heads of executive departments, there are 10 Cabinet-level officials. Biden altered his cabinet structure, elevating the chair of the Council of Economic Advisers,[1] director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy[2] and ambassador to the United Nations as Cabinet-level positions.[3] Biden initially removed the director of the Central Intelligence Agency from his Cabinet, but reversed the move in July 2023.[4][5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n77. **^** Anders Hagstrom; Brooke Singman; Greg Wehner (January 22, 2023). \"Biden to tap former COVID czar Jeff Zients as new chief of staff\". *Fox News*.

Of those 4,000 political appointments, more than 1250 require Senate confirmation. Upon taking office, Biden quickly placed more than 1,000 high-level officials into roles that did not require confirmation.[1] As of November\u00a015, 2023[update], according to tracking by *The Washington Post* and Partnership for Public Service covering 810 positions, 571 nominees have been confirmed by the United States Senate, 69 are being considered by the Senate, and 81 tracked positions have no nominee.[2]\n\n\n\n\n## Color key[edit]\n\n\n* Denotes appointees awaiting Senate confirmation.\n* Denotes appointees serving in an acting capacity.\n* Denotes appointees who have left office or offices which have been disbanded.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | This article is part of a series about\nJoe Biden |\n\n |\n| \n\n---\n\n* Political positions\n* Electoral history\n\n\n\n---\n\n* Early life and career\n* Eponyms\n* Family\n* Honors\n* Public image\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nU.S. Senator from Delaware\n* Judiciary Committee\n\t+ Bork hearings\n\t+ Thomas hearings\n\t+ 1994 Crime Bill\n\t+ Violence Against Women Act\n* Foreign Relations Committee\n\n\nElections:\n\n* 1972\n* 1978\n* 1984\n* 1990\n* 1996\n* 2002\n* 2008\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n47th Vice President of the United States\n* Transition\n* Tenure\n* Obama administration\n\t+ first inauguration\n\t+ second inauguration\n* Economic policy\n\t+ Great Recession response\n\t+ 2010 Tax Relief Act\n\t+ 2011 debt-ceiling crisis\n\t+ fiscal cliff\n* Foreign policy\n* Task forces\n\t+ Gun Violence\n\t+ Protect Students from Sexual Assault\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n46th President of the United States\nIncumbent\n* Presidency\n\t+ first 100 days\n\t+ timeline\n* Transition\n\t+ COVID-19 Advisory Board\n* Inauguration\n* Efforts to impeach\n\t+ inquiry\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Sanger, David E.
