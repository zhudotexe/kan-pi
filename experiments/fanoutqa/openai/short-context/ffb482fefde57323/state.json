Retrieved November 7, 2023.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAt least eleven films have held the record of 'highest-grossing film' since *The Birth of a Nation* assumed the top spot in 1915. Both *The Birth of a Nation* and *Gone with the Wind* spent twenty-five consecutive years apiece as the highest-grosser, with films directed by Steven Spielberg and James Cameron holding the record on three occasions each. Spielberg became the first director to break his own record when *Jurassic Park* overtook *E.T.*, and Cameron emulated the feat when *Avatar* broke the record set by *Titanic*. When it took over the top spot in 2019, *Avengers: Endgame* became the first sequel to hold the record of highest-grossing film, and in doing so interrupted thirty-six years of Spielberg/Cameron dominance before *Avatar* reclaimed the top spot two years later in 2021 upon a re-release.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | [# 3] |\n| 2021[97] | *Avatar* | $2,847,397,339 \u2021 | [# 1] |\n| *2022* | $2,923,706,026 \u2021 |\n\n\nRDistributor rental.\n\n\n\u2021Includes revenue from re-releases.

Disney films are usually co-directed and some directors have served on several winning teams: Wilfred Jackson, Hamilton Luske, Clyde Geronimi, David Hand, Ben Sharpsteen, Wolfgang Reitherman and Bill Roberts have all co-directed at least two films on the list. Only seven directors have topped the chart in consecutive years: McCarey (1944 and 1945), Nichols (1966 and 1967), Spielberg (1981 and 1982), Jackson (2002 and 2003), Verbinski (2006 and 2007) and the Russo brothers (2018 and 2019).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![A portrait of a bespectacled middle aged man.](image)Films directed by Steven Spielberg have been the highest-grossing film of the year on six occasions, and on three occasions have been the highest-grossing film of all time.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWhile inflation has eroded the achievements of most films from the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, there are franchises originating from that period that are still active. Besides the *Star Wars* and *Superman* franchises, *James Bond* and *Godzilla* films are still being released periodically; all four are among the highest-grossing franchises. Some of the older films that held the record of highest-grossing film still have respectable grosses by today's standards, but no longer compete numerically against today's top-earners in an era of much higher individual ticket prices. When those prices are adjusted for inflation, however, then *Gone with the Wind*\u2014which was the highest-grossing film outright for twenty-five years\u2014is still the highest-grossing film of all time. All grosses on the list are expressed in U.S. dollars at their nominal value, except where stated otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n## Highest-grossing films[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\u2020\u00a0*Background shading indicates that at least one film in the series is playing in the week commencing 7 June 2024 in theaters around the world*.\n\n\n\n**Highest-grossing franchises and film series**[\u00a7]\n\n(The films in each franchise can be viewed by selecting \"show\".)\n| \n\n| Rank\n | Series\n | Total worldwide gross\n | No. of films\n | Average of films\n | Highest-grossing film\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | Marvel Cinematic Universe*S \u2020* | $29,782,530,744\n | 33\n | $902,500,932\n | *Avengers: Endgame* ($2,797,501,328)\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | The Infinity Saga | $22,587,759,303\n | 23\n | $982,076,491\n | *Avengers: Endgame* ($2,797,501,328)\n |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
