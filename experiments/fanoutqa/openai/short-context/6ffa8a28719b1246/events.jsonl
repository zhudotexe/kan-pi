In 1951, the city's Home Rule Charter established a two-term limit for mayors.[4] The term limit is consecutive, not lifetime. \n\n\nThe mayorship of Philadelphia has been held by Democrats since 1952.

Penn subsequently appointed Edward Shippen under the city charter of 1701. The Philadelphia City Council then elected Shippen to a second term. Subsequent mayors, who held office for one year, were elected by the Philadelphia City Council. The initial mayors of Philadelphia were not compensated and candidates sometimes objected strongly to being selected to the position, sometimes choosing even to pay a fine rather than serve in the position.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n12. **^** Resigned to become the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.\n13. **^** Jones was a Democrat elected with the support of the Know Nothing party.\n14. **^** In 1854, the entire county was consolidated into the city, and the mayoral term was extended to two years.\n15. **^** Conrad was a Whig elected with the Know Nothings' support.\n16. **^** In 1861, the mayoral term was extended to three years.\n17. **^** In 1887, the mayoral term was extended to four years.

When he could not be located after three days, a new election had to be arranged, and Attwood was re-elected to a second term.\n\n\n\n### 19th century[edit]\n\n\nBeginning in 1826, Council could elect any citizen of Philadelphia to the mayoralty. From 1839, mayors were elected by popular vote. If no candidate won a majority of the popular vote, then the joint Councils (Select and Common) would decide between the two leading candidates. John Swift was the first mayor to be elected directly by the people in the 1840 election.\n\n\nThe term of office was extended to two years in 1854, three years in 1861, and four years in 1885. Further, The Act of 1885 prohibited mayors from succeeding themselves.[4]\n\n\n\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 43 | William Fisher | October 5, 1773 | October 4, 1774 | 58 | 76\n |\n| 44 | Samuel Rhoads | October 4, 1774 | October 5, 1775 | 59 | 77\n |\n| 45 | Samuel Powel | October 5, 1775 | July 4, 1776[g] | 60 | 78\n |\n\n\n### Post-independence mayors elected by the common council[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Alexander Taylor and Joseph Turner \nrefused election to the office of mayor.\n2. **^** After Attwood's first term, Anthony Morris II was elected mayor but fled to avoid taking office.

He was first elected to a term beginning on January 3, 2000, and was re-elected to a second term beginning in 2004. He is a Democrat and became mayor after having served 19 years in the Philadelphia City Council, including seven years as its president, before resigning as required under the Philadelphia City Charter in order to run for mayor. He followed Ed Rendell as mayor, assuming the post on January 3, 2000. Street was Philadelphia's second black mayor.\n\n\nStreet floated the possibility of being a candidate for statewide office in Pennsylvania. In light of corruption scandals, those prospects never materialized. *Time Magazine* listed him as one of the three worst big-city mayors in the United States in 2005.[4]\n\n\n\n\n## Biography and early career[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n33. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"PHA to pay $8M, take back local control\".

Upon leaving office, Street accepted an adjunct faculty position in the Temple University Department of Political Science. That spring, he taught two sections of a class on urban politics. Asked about his transition from public life to academia, the former mayor was quoted as saying, \"You know what? I think I'm really going to like it here!\"\n\n\nStreet was Chairman of the Philadelphia Housing Authority (PHA) board when it came under criticism for poor oversight and mismanagement. The board was accused of improprieties in its legal spending, of failing to oversee president Carl R. Greene before he was fired from the agency, and of other ethical violations.[33][34][35] Control of the PHA was taken from the city of Philadelphia and given to Housing and Urban Development in 2011 to address these issues and was then returned to the city in 2013 under the direction of a new board.[33][34][35]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nStreet was chosen unanimously by members of the Council to serve as President in 1992, after incumbent Joe Coleman retired, and was re-elected in 1996. Street, working closely with former Mayor Ed Rendell, was instrumental in crafting and implementing a financial plan that passed Council unanimously, and turned a $250 million deficit into the largest surplus in city history. Despite decreasing the business and wage tax four years in a row, Philadelphia still has the 10th largest tax burden in the United States. This is due to the financial burden to run the city's prisons, pay debt service, and employee pensions and health benefits.[7]\n\n\n\n## Mayor of Philadelphia[edit]\n\n\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\n#### 1999[edit]\n\n\nStreet was elected in one of the closest elections in Philadelphia history, defeating Republican Sam Katz by a margin of fewer than 7,500.[8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn an unusual circumstance, the City Council President at the time, Anna Verna, was briefly in the position of running the city before Mayor Street was sworn in, as Rendell resigned the post in December 1999 to become the head of the DNC (per Article III, Chapter 5, Section 3-500 of the Philadelphia Home Rule Charter).\nIn 2001, he was named runner up \"Politician of the Year\" by PoliticsPA.[9]\n\n\n\n#### 2003[edit]\n\n\nStreet was once again challenged by Sam Katz in the 2003 mayoral election. Despite an ongoing FBI investigation, Street was aided by Pennsylvania Governor and former Mayor of Philadelphia, Ed Rendell endorsing and campaigning for him.[10] He was named the 2003 Politician of the Year by the political website PoliticsPA, because \"It takes an extremely shrewd and effective politician to turn an FBI bugging of the mayor's office into a positive but that's exactly what Mayor John Street did.\"[11] Street won with 58% of the vote for reelection.[12]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2011, he changed his voter registration from Democrat to Independent. Though Street maintained the switch was only, \"..a means of keeping a variety of options available as a matter of good politics...\", some had speculated that he intended to challenge incumbent Democratic Mayor Michael Nutter in the 2011 mayoral election.[36] He ultimately did not participate in the primary, and instead his brother, Milton Street challenged and lost to Mayor Nutter.[37]\n\n\n\n## Mayoral electoral history[edit]\n\n\n\n\nPhiladelphia mayoral election, 1999\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Democratic | John F.

Street with President George W. Bush in Philadelphia during Independence Day in 2001\nDuring Street's first term, much emphasis was placed on the \"Neighborhood Transformation Initiative.\" The Neighborhood Transformation Initiative (NTI), which was unveiled in April 2001 was an unprecedented effort to counter the history of decline in the City of Philadelphia and revitalize its neighborhoods. The program was designed to revitalize and restore communities, to develop or restore quality housing, to clean and secure streets, and to create opportunities for vibrant cultural and recreational facilities.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nStreet was born in Norristown, Pennsylvania, and grew up as a member of a farming household. He graduated from Conshohocken High School, received a B.A. degree in English from Oakwood College in Huntsville, Alabama, and his J.D. degree from Temple University, which he had to apply to several times before he was accepted. Following his graduation from law school, Street served clerkships with Common Pleas Court Judge Mathew W. Bullock, Jr. and with the United States Department of Justice from which he was quickly terminated for poor performance. In his first professional job Street taught English at an elementary school and, later, at the Philadelphia Opportunities Industrialization Center (OIC). He then practiced law briefly prior to entering into public service. Street is married and has four children, including Sharif Street,[5] and is a practicing Seventh-day Adventist. His deceased brother, Milton, was a former member of the state legislature, and a two-time mayoral candidate.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Maryniak, Paul (January 4, 1992). \"An inauguration or a funeral?\". *Pittsburgh Post-Gazette*.

City of Philadelphia\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nStreet also made children and their welfare a focus of his first term in office. In his first inaugural address in January 2000, Street officially proclaimed the year 2000 \"The Year of the Child\" in Philadelphia. He sought to increase funding for after-school programs, and formed the Philadelphia Children's Commission, a diverse group of government, civic, business, and faith-based leadership, whose job it was to advise Street on policies and programs that would have a positive impact in the lives of Philadelphia's children. He also sought to fight truancy among school aged children.[14][15]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Mayor Street celebrating President George W. Bush's 55th birthday in Philadelphia.\nDrawing ire from skateboarders, he banned skateboarding from the internationally famous Love Park after the city had hosted the X-Games in 2001 and 2002 at the Wachovia Center. In 2004, he turned down a $1-million offer from DC Shoes to maintain and renovate the park to allow skating. Instead the city spent $800,000 on adding obstacles to prevent skaters from skating in the park.[16]\n\n\nStreet created the Office of Health and Fitness after the city was named the fattest city in the nation by *Men's Fitness* magazine in 1999. The magazine cited the low number of athletic facilities and high number of fast-food restaurants. Street also signed into law a smoking ban on September 12, 2006.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring the re-election campaign against Sam Katz, the FBI acknowledged that it had placed listening devices in the Mayor's office as part of a sweeping investigation of municipal corruption.[23] The FBI's investigation uncovered a corruption scheme led by Street's friend and fund raiser Ron White, who died before going to trial.[24] Former city treasurer Corey Kemp, a member of Street's administration, was sentenced to 10 years in jail after being found guilty on 27 corruption-related charges in May 2005.[25] Eventually at least 15 individuals connected to Street were convicted of crimes related to City Hall corruption.[26] One additional prosecution of members of Street's administration took place in the wake of the Kemp conviction and resulted in an acquittal of Mayoral Aide John D. Christmas.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn September 2005, a prominent Muslim clergyman, Shamsud-din Ali, in Philadelphia was sentenced to more than seven years in prison on racketeering and other charges. Prosecutors said the cleric, who was once a member of Mayor John F. Street's transition team, used his political connections to obtain dubious loans, donations and city contracts. Ali was sentenced to 87 months in prison.[27] His conviction was affirmed on July 18, 2007, by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit (493 F.3d 387).\n\n\nLeonard Ross, a lawyer and close advisor of Mayor Street, who led a committee trying to develop a crucial piece of city-owned property, was charged with fraud and conspiracy in December 2005, and later pleaded guilty to the charges.[26]\n\n\nThe 2003 Philadelphia mayoral election was captured in the documentary film *The Shame of a City* by Tigre Hill, which gave viewers an inside look at the campaign and portrayed Street in a negative light.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe murder rate in Philadelphia hit a seven-year high during Street's tenure, but the overall trend was significantly lower than in the 1970s under Frank Rizzo.[*citation needed*] In 2005 there were 380 murders, up from 330 in 2004. Forty-five percent of those murdered were 25 or younger. 2006 saw 406 murders in the city, including a Philadelphia police officer.[18] This murder trend continued to escalate into 2007, with 127 murders occurring by the end of April, 2007, a rate far in excess of the larger cities of New York City, Los Angeles and Chicago.[19] At least one commentator referred to Street as being \"strangely silent\" in his efforts to reduce the city's murder rate.[20]\n\n\nOn July 27, 2006, Street launched the Adolescent Violence Reduction Partnership (AVRP) as a way to prevent high risk youth (target age 10-15) from being victims of combat violence. He also expanded the Youth Violence Reduction Partnership (YVRP) into the 19th Police District in West Philadelphia.[21]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nStreet also advocated the construction of a citywide Wi-Fi network. The network is to be run by the non-profit organization Wireless Philadelphia in partnership with the city and commercial internet service providers. Opponents of the plan suggest that government involvement will quash innovation. Supporters hope that the plan will help bring information access to poor Philadelphians and make the city more attractive to young and educated people.\n\n\nIn a 2002 address at a convention of the NAACP, Street said that \"the brothers and sisters are running the city. Oh, yes. The brothers and sisters are running this city. Running it! Don't you let nobody fool you, we are in charge of the City of Brotherly Love. We are in charge! We are in charge!\" This observation attracted some criticism and charges of racial divisiveness.[17]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe race was covered in the documentary film *The Shame of a City*.\n\n\n\n### Policy[edit]\n\n\nHis relationship with the City Council was tenuous at best. He and former councilman Michael Nutter, who became the 98th Mayor of Philadelphia, often engaged in public political sparring. Regardless, Street ultimately agreed to a 2005 revision of Nutter's New York-style smoking ban (after much public criticism over his failure to support a smoking ban in Philadelphia).\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_CI5aLKWq5fgXbHab3R1ZMspv","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

He served from 1984 to 1992, a period which included the controversial MOVE police action and house bombing in 1985. Goode was also a community activist, chair of the state Public Utility Commission, and managing director for the City of Philadelphia.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nGoode was born into a family of tenant farmers near Seaboard, North Carolina.[1] His family arrived in Philadelphia in 1953 and lived in the Paschall neighborhood in Southwest Philadelphia. He was an honors student at John Bartram High School and then he graduated from Morgan State University in 1961. He was a member of the Reserve Officers Training Corps while attending Morgan State and entered the US Army as a First Lieutenant in the military police. He returned to Philadelphia and briefly worked as a manager at a building maintenance firm and as an insurance adjuster before he was hired by the Philadelphia Council for Community Development in 1967. He became executive director of PCCD in 1971. In 1967 he and his wife bought a house in the Paschall neighborhood, where he served as a deacon of Paschall's First Baptist Church. In 1968, he completed his graduate studies at the Fels Institute of Government at the University of Pennsylvania where he earned his master's in Public Administration.[2]\n\n\n\n## Service with the Public Utility Commission[edit]\n\n\nAfter African-American state senators complained that there had never been an African-American member of the state Public Utility Commission (PUC), Governor Milton Shapp began actively searching for one. His aide, Terry Dellmuth, knew Goode from his community and political activities and recommended him.\n\n\nAs a PUC commissioner, Goode met with community groups around the state, studied relevant issues, compiled what was seen as a pro-consumer record, and forged good working relations with his fellow commissioners. He was soon elevated to the chairmanship of the PUC, where he continued his pro-consumer policies but worked to limit PUC expenditures.\n\n\n\n## Work in the Office of the Mayor[edit]\n\n\nPhiladelphia Mayor Bill Green, who had been elected in November 1979, had promised to appoint a black managing director after winning a racially divisive Democratic primary against former deputy mayor Charles Bowser. Green kept his promise by appointing Goode as managing director at the urging of key members of the black community. [*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Mayor of Philadelphia[edit]\n\n\nBefore the primary election of 1983, Green decided not to seek reelection. Goode jumped into the race and defeated former Mayor Frank Rizzo in a racially polarized primary election. Goode went on to win the general election over former Green fund-raiser and Philadelphia Stock Exchange Chairman John Egan, the Republican Party nominee.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nGoode's tenure as mayor was marred in 1985 by the MOVE Bombing, in which police attempted to clear a building in West Philadelphia inhabited by MOVE, a radical back-to-nature group, whose members, under the leadership of founder John Africa, had long defied city officials by yelling slogans and statements from a megaphone, ignoring city sanitation codes, assaulting neighbors, and resisting law enforcement officers.[3] During the attempt to evacuate the compound, police used tear gas, leading to members of MOVE opening fire on them. During the final assault on the building, the police dropped an improvised bomb made of C-4 plastic explosive and Tovex, an explosive gel used in underwater mining, onto to a bunker-like cubicle on the roof of the building. This caused the house to catch fire, and ignited a massive blaze which eventually consumed almost 4 city blocks, killed 11 people, and left 240 people homeless.[4]\n\n\nIn 1987 Goode ran for reelection, winning the Democratic primary before facing off in the general election against former mayor Frank Rizzo, who had converted to the Republican Party after losing the 1983 Democratic primary to Goode. Goode defeated Rizzo 51%-49% to earn a second term.\n\n\n\n## Post-mayoral life[edit]\n\n\nGoode stayed active after leaving office as mayor by holding a position in the U.S. Department of Education. He earned a Doctor of Ministry at Palmer Theological Seminary,[5] and became a minister and professor at Eastern University, as well as a leader of advocacy for faith-based initiatives. He currently serves as CEO of Amachi, a mentoring program for children of incarcerated parents. He was awarded the Purpose Prize, a $100,000 award given to exceptional individuals over age 60 who are working to address critical social problems.\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Holst, Arthur Matthew (2013). \"Goode, W.

Kenney has maintained that Philadelphia will continue to act as a sanctuary city despite threats that cities would stop receiving federal funding.[34] Trump said, \"Here in Philadelphia, murder has been steady—I mean—just terribly increasing.\"[35]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2014, Kenney successfully introduced legislation that ended arrests for possession of small amounts of marijuana. The bill replaced incarceration with the requirement to pay a fine. In advocating for the bill, Kenney had cited the disproportionate effect of arrests for small amounts of marijuana on African-Americans.[7] Philadelphia became the largest city in the country to decriminalize marijuana.[8]\n\n\nKenney garnered criticism from local and national economic commentators when he proposed bonus pension payments, distributing funds when pension plans exceed target returns in any given year even though solvency depends on retaining above-average earnings to prepare for years with below-average earnings.[9][10]\n\n\nWhile on the Philadelphia City Council, Kenney worked as a consultant at Vitetta Architects and Engineers, served on the Independence Blue Cross board, and was an adjunct professor at the University of Pennsylvania.[11] He gave up these positions when he was elected mayor in 2015.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n31. **^** Allyn, Bobby (October 10, 2018). \"'Come And Arrest Me': Former Pa.

Early in his career, Kenney was known as a candid and opinionated councilman and mayor, particularly on social media platforms like Twitter.[42] Since his election as Mayor of Philadelphia, Kenney has taken a much more measured tone with respect to his political opponents.[43]\n\n\n\n### Archdiocese[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn October 2017, Mayor Kenney announced that the city was taking back control of its public schools after sixteen years of state control. In an address to City Council, Kenney outlined the end of the state-dominated School Reform Commission and a path to local control of the Philadelphia School District by July 1, 2018.[26]\n\n\n\n#### Opioid epidemic[edit]\n\n\nKenney created *The Mayor's Task Force to Combat the Opioid Epidemic in Philadelphia* in 2016. The committee concluded its work and presented a final proposal in May 2017.[27]\n\n\nIn June of that year, Kenney and U.S. Representative Bob Brady negotiated a deal with Conrail, the company that owns abandoned train tracks in Kensington that became a well-known area for open-air heroin use, to clean up the property.[28]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n8. **^** Goldstein, Chris (October 12, 2017). \"Timeline: Marijuana legalization milestones in Philly and beyond | Philly 420\". *www.inquirer.com*.

Kenney mobilized numerous gay rights legislation during his time in the Philadelphia City Council, many of which were criticized by Catholic leaders in the city. Notably, Kenney joined the debate over the abrupt firing of a beloved faculty member at Waldron Mercy Academy in Merion who came out as gay. In a *Philadelphia Inquirer* story, Kenney accused the \"cowardly men\" in the Archdiocese of orchestrating the firing: \"If you're a church official and you feel that strongly that this woman and her partner are such a threat to society, stand up and say so,\" Kenney told the paper.[44] In a 2014 tweet, Kenney stated, \"The Arch *[sic]* don't care about people. It's about image and money. Pope Francis needs to kick some ass here!\"[45]\n\n\n\n### Sports talk radio[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFormer New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a self-proclaimed Dallas Cowboys fan, has frequently slammed the Philadelphia Eagles, one of the Cowboys' biggest rivals. In early 2017, Christie called Philadelphia fans \"angry, awful people\" and said Citizens Bank Park, the home of the Philadelphia Phillies, \"is not safe for civilized people.\" Kenney went on a local sports talk radio program to respond to Christie's claims. \"He's got the biggest 'L' on his forehead of anybody in the country. He ran for president for one hot-mess minute and then when that was over he was moon-dogging Trump thinking he was going to get a big job,\" Kenney said. \"Now I think he's just bitter and has got nowhere to go. Who's going to hire him? I just think he's just done,\" Kenney said. \"Bullies always lose, and he's a bully.\"[48]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nKenney has two adult children, Nora and Brendan, with his former wife Maureen. Kenney and Maureen separated in 2010.[49] They formally divorced in 2018.[50]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_w2OeHwdqopAUCoI1JHY2YUE8","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

A Philadelphia Eagles fan, Rendell is also a football analyst on NBC Sports Philadelphia's Eagles Postgame Live, hosted by Michael Barkann.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs district attorney, Rendell reportedly[7] had a mean temper while doing his job. Once, he yelled in the governor's face for releasing a certain prisoner. It has been said that Rendell would even punch walls or throw furniture when he became upset. In 1980, Rendell received 28 delegate votes for Vice President[8] at the Democratic National Convention, although he was not a candidate. He served two terms as DA before leaving in 1986 to run for Governor of Pennsylvania.[9] He was defeated in the Democratic gubernatorial primary by Bob Casey, Sr.[10]\n\n\nIn 1982, during his second term, Rendell presided over the controversial prosecution of Mumia Abu-Jamal, resulting in a death sentence that was overturned in 2011.

He was elected District Attorney of Philadelphia for two terms from 1978 to 1986. He developed a reputation for being tough on crime,[1] fueling a run for Governor of Pennsylvania in 1986, which Rendell lost in the primary.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the November 2002 gubernatorial election, he defeated Republican State Attorney General Mike Fisher, garnering 53 percent of the vote to Fisher's 44 percent.[19] Rendell won not only Philadelphia County, which is heavily Democratic, but also traditionally Republican suburbs of Philadelphia,[20] largely due to his popularity as mayor of Philadelphia. These traditionally Republican voters who backed Rendell were called *Rendellicans* in other parts of the state and were a key part of the success of his campaign.[21]\n\n\nIn a 2002 PoliticsPA feature story designating politicians with yearbook superlatives, he was named the \"Most Likely to Succeed.\"[22] His campaign website was described as having \"cutting edge in design for a political site.\"[23]\n\n\n\n## Governor of Pennsylvania (2003–2011)[edit]\n\n\n### First term[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs mayor, Rendell inherited massive fiscal problems. The state legislature established a fiscal oversight board to monitor the City of Philadelphia's fiscal issues. During his career as mayor, Rendell cut a $250 million deficit, balanced Philadelphia's budget and oversaw five consecutive years of budget surpluses, reduced business and wage taxes for four consecutive years, implemented new revenue-generating initiatives, and dramatically improved services to Philadelphia neighborhoods. He was given the nickname \"Philadelphia's Renaissance or Revival\" because of how well he did with the budget.[13] He also appointed Philadelphia's first ever Latino deputy mayors, Benjamin Ramos and Manuel Ortiz. Rendell's cost-cutting policies brought him strong opposition from labor unions; however, he was re-elected in 1995, defeating Republican Joe Rocks with 80% of the vote.[14]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Rendell signing his book in 2012\n![](image)Rendell with Governors Tom Corbett, Tom Wolf, Tom Ridge, and Mark Schweiker in 2015\n![](image)Rendell and Governor Tom Wolf in 2019\nRendell was term-limited for the election of 2010.

In 2006, he won a bet with the Governor of Washington, Christine Gregoire in supporting the Pittsburgh Steelers in their quest to win Super Bowl XL over the Seattle Seahawks 21–10.[70]\n\n\nAs a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania, Rendell frequently supports the Penn basketball team and can be seen at games at the Palestra.

The only exemption being if the individual is being released following a first or second degree felony conviction and federal officials obtain a warrant from a judge[37][38] - effectively making Philadelphia a sanctuary city.[39][40] Nutter indicated that the change in policy supports public safety and will help rebuild the trust between police and the immigrant community.[38] The executive order was highlighted in June 2014 after a previously deported undocumented immigrant from Honduras was accused of raping a woman in Rittenhouse Square with the concern that if acquitted, the accused would not be submitted for deportation due to Philadelphia's new policy.[41][42][43]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of mayors of the largest 50 US cities\n* History of African Americans in Philadelphia\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2012, Mayor Nutter signed Bill No. 120428 which amends the 'Energy Conservation' portion of the Philadelphia Code to require large commercial buildings to benchmark and report energy and water usage data to the city.
