This was the best start in the Astros' 55-year history. The Astros entered the All-Star Break with an American League-best 60\u201329 record, a 16-game lead in the division, and one game shy of the best record in MLB, which had just barely slipped to the Dodgers right before the All-Star Break.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The 2017 team at the White House with President Donald Trump, March 2018\nOn September 26, 2018, the Astros' second consecutive AL West division championship was clinched with a victory by the Seattle Mariners over the Oakland A's.

Cora was implicated in the report but Manfred withheld a decision on his punishment until the completion of a separate investigation into electronic sign stealing in 2018, when Cora was manager of the Red Sox.[103] However, the report led the Red Sox to dismiss Cora two days after it was published,[104] and the Mets did the same with Beltran, who had been hired as manager shortly before the original story.[105]\n\n\n\n### 2020\u2013present: Second World Series title[edit]\n\n\nOn January 29, 2020, the Astros announced they hired Dusty Baker as their new manager to replace Hinch.[106][107] James Click was hired to replace Lunhow as general manager on February 2.[108]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Houston won two of the three games, although Philadelphia clinched their postseason berth in the first game with a win.[7] The 19-game gap between the Astros and Phillies is the second largest in World Series history, trailing only the 23-game gap in 1906 between the 93-win Chicago White Sox and the 116-win Chicago Cubs.[8][9][10]\n\n\n\n### Houston Astros[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2022 Houston Astros season\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Astros won the AL West in 2023, but they did not do it in dominant fashion like their teams' from 2017-2019 and 2021-2022. Injuries and poor performance to their rotation saw the team trade young prospects for Justin Verlander at the trade deadline, who had signed a two-year deal with the New York Mets in the off-season.[105] Overall, they finished tied with the Texas Rangers in first-place in the AL West, but won the tie-breaker thus giving them the division. However, in the postseason, the Astros were beaten by their in-state rival Texas Rangers in the 2023 ALCS, with the visitor winning all seven games on the road similar to the 2019 World Series. After the season, Dusty Baker retired as manager.[106]\n\n\n\n### Philadelphia[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThis is the fifth World Series appearance for the Astros, and the fourth[a] as the American League team.[11] The Astros qualified for the 2022 postseason as the American League (AL) West division winner.[12] It was their fifth AL West championship in six years and their second straight divisional championship. The Astros entered the postseason as the top seed in the American League. In the Division Series, they swept the fifth-seeded Seattle Mariners. In the American League Championship Series, they swept the second-seeded New York Yankees to make it to the World Series for the fourth time in the previous six seasons (2017, 2019, 2021) and the second consecutive season.[13]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPe\u00f1a became the first-position player (and the third player overall) to win the award in his rookie season.[76] In total for the postseason, the Houston bullpen allowed five total runs over 54+1\u20443 innings for an ERA of 0.83, becoming the first team to throw at least 40 postseason innings of the bullpen with an ERA below 1.00 in major league history.[77] The Astros became the sixth team since 1960 to win the World Series after losing the previous year, with the last having been the Kansas City Royals in 2015.[78]\n\n\nWith the win, the Astros finished 11\u20132 in the postseason, the fourth team to win a World Series while losing fewer than three games in the Wild Card era after the 1998 New York Yankees (11\u20132), the 1999 New York Yankees (11\u20131), and the 2005 Chicago White Sox (11\u20131).[79]\n\n\n\n### Composite line score[edit]\n\n\n2022 World Series (4\u20132): **Houston Astros** beat Philadelphia Phillies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHouston's pitching staff led the American League in 2022 with the fewest runs allowed, lowest opponent's batting average and walks plus hits per inning pitched, the most strikeouts, and posted an MLB-best 2.78 bullpen earned run average (ERA).[14] Justin Verlander, who had missed Houston's postseason runs in 2020 and 2021, made his return from Tommy John surgery and led the AL in wins, ERA, and walks plus hits per inning pitched ratio.[15] Rookie shortstop Jeremy Pe\u00f1a won the League Championship Series Most Valuable Player Award after batting 6-for-18 (.333) with two home runs and two doubles in the ALCS.[16]\n\n\nDusty Baker, in his 25th season as a major league manager, was seeking his first World Series win as a manager (he won the 1981 World Series as a player with the Dodgers).

Atlanta closer Will Smith was brought in to pitch the bottom of the ninth. He allowed a leadoff single to Michael Brantley and retired the next three batters, the last out being a Yuli Gurriel infield grounder fielded by Swanson, who threw to Freeman, giving the Braves the title.[62] With this final inning, Will Smith finished off a postseason in which he closed 11 of 16 Braves games while allowing no runs. Jorge Soler won the World Series Most Valuable Player Award.[63]\n\n\nWith the World Series victory, Joc Pederson became a back-to-back World Series winner on two different teams, joining names like Jack Morris, Ryan Theriot, Jake Peavy and Ben Zobrist who previously accomplished that feat.[64] Pederson had become a fan-favorite throughout his three-month stay in Atlanta, particularly for his preference to wear pearls.[65]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThis was the Braves' first World Series appearance since 1999, tenth in franchise history, and sixth while in Atlanta.[10] The Braves entered the series with three prior World Series titles, one as the Atlanta Braves in 1995 and one while based in each of their previous cities of Boston (1914) and Milwaukee (1957).[10]\n\n\n\n### Houston Astros[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2021 Houston Astros season\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Astros and Braves had previously met in the postseason five times, in the National League Division Series when the Astros competed in the National League.[3] Of those five series, the Braves won three (1997, 1999, and 2001) while the Astros won two (2004 and 2005).[3] The Astros and Braves played in the National League West from 1969-1993.\n\n\nThe teams' jerseys lacked a World Series patch for the first time since 1997, though a patch was on their caps.[4]\n\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nManagers Dusty Baker of the Astros (left) and Brian Snitker of the Braves\n\n### Atlanta Braves[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2021 Atlanta Braves season\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Astros had home-field advantage due to their superior regular-season record over that of the Braves. The series was played in a 2\u20133\u20132 format, with the Astros hosting Games 1, 2, and 6 (and 7 if it was necessary); and the Braves hosting Games 3, 4, and 5. The teams split the first two games, which were played at Minute Maid Park in Houston, and the Braves won Games 3 and 4 at Truist Park in Atlanta to take a 3-1 lead. The Astros won Game 5, returning the series to Houston. The Braves won Game 6 to win the World Series.

In 2014, they acquired shortstop prospect Trea Turner in a trade with the San Diego Padres, with Turner eventually becoming a major part of the Nationals' core.[48] In 2015, the Nationals signed top free agent pitcher Max Scherzer to a 7-year, $210 million contract.[49] That year, Harper had one of the greatest offensive seasons in MLB history, becoming the youngest player to win the NL MVP unanimously.[50] However the Nationals missed the playoffs again, leading to Williams' firing.[51] The team hired veteran manager Dusty Baker in 2016, and returned to the playoffs only to be eliminated by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 2016 NLDS in five games.

The team secured their first playoff berth and first division title in 2012. They won the National League East again in 2014, 2016, and 2017, but failed to advance past the NLDS each time.

Scherzer, although still dominant, struggled with lower body injuries until he was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers at the 2021 trade deadline.[125] Patrick Corbin led the National League is losses and earned runs given up in 2021 and 2022. Anibal Sanchez struggled mighty during the 2020 season so much that he spent the 2021 season out of baseball entirely, only to return to Washington in 2022. Lastly, Stephen Strasburg, Washington's MVP of the 2019 World Series, was rewarded with a lucrative seven-year contract with the Nationals after the World Series.[126] Unfortunately, Strasburg suffered many injuries, and he only made a combined eight starts from 2020 to 2023.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n2019 World Series (4\u20133): **Washington Nationals** (NL) defeated Houston Astros (AL).\n\n\n\n\n\n \n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Washington Nationals** | 3 | 1 | 0 | 2 | 5 | 1 | 12 | 4 | 5 | 33 | 58 | 4\n |\n| Houston Astros | 8 | 4 | 1 | 4 | 2 | 1 | 5 | 2 | 3 | 30 | 68 | 3\n |\n| **Home runs:**WAS: Juan Soto (3), Adam Eaton (2), Anthony Rendon (2), Howie Kendrick (1), Kurt Suzuki (1), Michael A.

The Nationals let all-star third baseman Anthony Rendon leave in free agency to the Los Angeles Angels in the offseason (the Angels also signed 2019 Nationals part-time catcher Kurt Suzuki). The COVID-19 pandemic kept the Nationals from properly celebrating their 2019 championship the following season, as spectators were not allowed in the stands during the shortened season. They raised their championship banner in front of an empty Nationals Park on the first day of the 2020 season, and received their championship rings in the clubhouse rather than on the field in front of the fans.[122] The Nationals finished tied for last in the NL East in 2020. Postseason hero Howie Kendrick retired at the end of the season.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Nationals' win marked the sixth straight year that a team clinched the World Series title via a win on the road,[note 9] including four times that a Game\u00a07 was won by the visiting team.[93] For the first time in major North American sports history, the visiting team won all seven games of a best-of-seven postseason series.[94][95] In championship series of the NBA, NHL, and MLB contested during 2019, road teams compiled an overall 17\u20133 record.[note 10] Additionally, the Nationals became the first team to win the World Series in their first appearance since 2002, when the Anaheim Angels accomplished the feat by defeating the San Francisco Giants in seven games.[98] During postgame ceremonies, Washington's Stephen Strasburg was presented with the World Series Most Valuable Player Award, the first time a former No. 1 overall draft pick earned the award,[4][99] and the first time a pitcher had won the award since Madison Bumgarner had won in 2014.\n\n\n\n### Series statistics[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn fact, the Nationals are the only team the Astros have faced in the World Series that they have never faced in a pre-World Series playoff round, since the Astros have faced the White Sox, Dodgers, and Braves during at least one playoff round prior to the World Series. The Astros and Nationals did not play an interleague game in 2019, and last faced each other during the 2017 regular season. The two teams share a spring training site in West Palm Beach, Florida, and opened the 2019 spring training schedule against each other.[9] This was the second World Series to feature two expansion teams, the first being in 2015 between the Kansas City Royals and the New York Mets.[note 3][10] The Astros were deemed as heavy favorites to win the title.[11]\n\n\n\n### Washington Nationals[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2019 Washington Nationals season\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n9. **^** Rome, Chandler (August 29, 2018). \"Astros unveil 2019 spring training schedule\". *chron.com*.
