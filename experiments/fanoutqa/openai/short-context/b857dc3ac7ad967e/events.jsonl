Their flowers are usually large, showy, and brightly coloured, generally red, orange, pink, yellow, or white (usually in warm colours). They often have a different coloured blotch at the base of the tepals (petals and sepals, collectively), internally. Because of a degree of variability within the populations and a long history of cultivation, classification has been complex and controversial. The tulip is a member of the lily family, Liliaceae,[1] along with 14 other genera, where it is most closely related to *Amana*, *Erythronium*, and *Gagea* in the tribe Lilieae. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n52. **^** Brickell, Christopher; Zuk, Judith D.

The name \"tulip\" is thought to be derived from a Persian word for turban, which it may have been thought to resemble by those who discovered it. Tulips were originally found in a band stretching from Southern Europe to Central Asia, but since the seventeenth century have become widely naturalised and cultivated (*see map*). In their natural state, they are adapted to steppes and mountainous areas with temperate climates. Flowering in the spring, they become dormant in the summer once the flowers and leaves die back, emerging above ground as a shoot from the underground bulb in early spring.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![Tulip Bulb Depth](image)Tulip bulb planting depth 15 cm (6 inches)\nA number of names are based on naturalised garden tulips and are usually referred to as neo-tulipae. These are often difficult to trace back to their original cultivar, and in some cases have been occurring in the wild for many centuries. The history of naturalisation is unknown, but populations are usually associated with agricultural practices and are possibly linked to saffron cultivation[*clarification needed*]. Some neo-tulipae have been brought into cultivation, and are often offered as botanical tulips. These cultivated plants can be classified into two Cultivar Groups: 'Grengiolensis Group', with picotee tepals, and the 'Didieri Group' with unicolourous tepals.\n\n\n\n### Horticulture[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBecause tulip bulbs don't reliably come back every year, tulip varieties that fall out of favour with present aesthetic values have traditionally gone extinct. Unlike other flowers that do not suffer this same limitation, the Tulip's historical forms do not survive alongside their modern incarnations.[3]\n\n\n\n### Horticultural classification[edit]\n\n\n![](image)'Gavota', a division 3 cultivar\n![](image)'Yonina', a division 6 cultivar\n![](image)'Texas Flame', a division 10 cultivar\nIn horticulture, tulips are divided into fifteen groups (Divisions) mostly based on flower morphology and plant size.[52][53]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nGenus of plants\n\nThis article is about the plant.

They are low growing plants, whose flower stems remain underground, that bear relatively large white, yellow, orange or purple flowers and then become dormant after flowering. Many are cultivated for their flowers, appearing in autumn, winter, or spring. The flowers close at night and in overcast weather conditions. The crocus has been known throughout recorded history, mainly as the source of saffron. Saffron is obtained from the dried stigma of *Crocus sativus*, an autumn-blooming species. It is valued as a spice and dyestuff, and is one of the most expensive spices in the world. Iran is the center of saffron production. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (1998). \"An ordinal classification for the families of flowering plants\". *Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden*. **85** (4): 531–553. doi:10.2307/2992015.
