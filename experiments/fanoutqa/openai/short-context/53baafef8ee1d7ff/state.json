Besides the *Star Wars* and *Superman* franchises, *James Bond* and *Godzilla* films are still being released periodically; all four are among the highest-grossing franchises. Some of the older films that held the record of highest-grossing film still have respectable grosses by today's standards, but no longer compete numerically against today's top-earners in an era of much higher individual ticket prices. When those prices are adjusted for inflation, however, then *Gone with the Wind*\u2014which was the highest-grossing film outright for twenty-five years\u2014is still the highest-grossing film of all time. All grosses on the list are expressed in U.S. dollars at their nominal value, except where stated otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n## Highest-grossing films[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n99. **^** Robertson, Patrick (1991). *Guinness Book of Movie Facts and Feats* (4\u00a0ed.).

Besides the *Star Wars* and *Superman* franchises, *James Bond* and *Godzilla* films are still being released periodically; all four are among the highest-grossing franchises. Some of the older films that held the record of highest-grossing film still have respectable grosses by today's standards, but no longer compete numerically against today's top-earners in an era of much higher individual ticket prices. When those prices are adjusted for inflation, however, then *Gone with the Wind*\u2014which was the highest-grossing film outright for twenty-five years\u2014is still the highest-grossing film of all time. All grosses on the list are expressed in U.S. dollars at their nominal value, except where stated otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n## Highest-grossing films[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t* *Cleopatra*: \"Domestic Rentals: $0.5; Production Cost: $0.3 (Unadjusted $s in Millions of $s).\"\n88. **^** Birchard, Robert S.

Listed below is the net negative cost: the costs of the actual filming, not including promotional costs (i.e. advertisements, commercials, posters, etc.) and after accounting for tax subsidies. The charts are ordered by budgets that have been independently audited or officially acknowledged by the production companies where they are known; most companies will not give a statement on the actual production costs, so often only estimates by professional researchers and movie industry writers are available.

Amblin Entertainment and Touchstone Pictures placed the actual expenditure on the film itself at around $50 million,[226] but it is not clear if the figures for the other films on the list include or exclude the overhead. Interest payments on the budget came to $17,105,000 which brought the full financial commitment on production to over $75 million.[225]\n44. ^ ***a*** ***b*** 20th Century Fox put the official budget of James Cameron's *The Abyss* (1989) at $43 million;[229] however, some estimates place the true cost as high as $70 million, which would have made it the most expensive film made up to that point.[230]\n45. **^** Estimates put the budget for *True Lies* between $100 million[237][238] and $120 million,[114] but either way it was still the first film to cost over $100 million.[236]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![The theatrical poster for Ben-Hur (1925) depicting a man behaving in a sexually aggressive manner towards a woman cowering from him.](image)*Ben-Hur* (1925) was the most expensive film of the silent era, possibly holding the record for over twenty years.\nDue to the secretive nature of Hollywood accounting, it is not clear which film is the most expensive film ever made. *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* officially holds the record with a net budget of $447 million (although it is possible that *Avatar: The Way of Water* costs more if its price tag is towards the upper-end of its reported $350\u2013460 million production costs).

Besides the *Star Wars* and *Superman* franchises, *James Bond* and *Godzilla* films are still being released periodically; all four are among the highest-grossing franchises. Some of the older films that held the record of highest-grossing film still have respectable grosses by today's standards, but no longer compete numerically against today's top-earners in an era of much higher individual ticket prices. When those prices are adjusted for inflation, however, then *Gone with the Wind*\u2014which was the highest-grossing film outright for twenty-five years\u2014is still the highest-grossing film of all time. All grosses on the list are expressed in U.S. dollars at their nominal value, except where stated otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n## Highest-grossing films[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n51. **^** Schickel, Richard (1996). *D.

Amblin Entertainment and Touchstone Pictures placed the actual expenditure on the film itself at around $50 million,[226] but it is not clear if the figures for the other films on the list include or exclude the overhead. Interest payments on the budget came to $17,105,000 which brought the full financial commitment on production to over $75 million.[225]\n44. ^ ***a*** ***b*** 20th Century Fox put the official budget of James Cameron's *The Abyss* (1989) at $43 million;[229] however, some estimates place the true cost as high as $70 million, which would have made it the most expensive film made up to that point.[230]\n45. **^** Estimates put the budget for *True Lies* between $100 million[237][238] and $120 million,[114] but either way it was still the first film to cost over $100 million.[236]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n31. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Financial documents filed in New Zealand show that production costs on *The Hobbit* trilogy totaled $745 million through March 2014 against a $122 million tax rebate.[73]\n32. ^ ***a*** ***b*** WingNut Films stated that the budget for the three *Lord of the Rings* films was $260 million, however estimates of the cost during production varied from $270 million to $360 million, none of which were confirmed or denied by WingNut.[76] Other estimates put the final cost at $281 million and $285 million.[251][252][9]\n33. ^ ***a*** ***b***  *The Matrix Reloaded* and *The Matrix Revolutions* were produced together at a reported cost of $127 million[245][246][247] and $110 million[248] respectively for a combined total of $237 million. Some reports put the combined cost of the production at $300 million.[249][250]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nInflation, filming techniques and external market forces affect the economics of film production. Costs rose steadily during the silent era with *Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ* (1925) setting a record that lasted well into the sound era. Television had an impact on rising costs in the 1950s and early 1960s as cinema competed with it for audiences, culminating in 1963 with *Cleopatra*; despite being the highest earning film of the year, *Cleopatra* did not earn back its costs on its original release. The 1990s saw two thresholds crossed, with *True Lies* costing $100 million in 1994 and *Titanic* costing $200 million in 1997, both directed by James Cameron. Since then it has become normal for a tent-pole feature from a major film studio to cost over $100 million and an increasing number of films are costing $200 million or more.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![The theatrical poster for Ben-Hur (1925) depicting a man behaving in a sexually aggressive manner towards a woman cowering from him.](image)*Ben-Hur* (1925) was the most expensive film of the silent era, possibly holding the record for over twenty years.\nDue to the secretive nature of Hollywood accounting, it is not clear which film is the most expensive film ever made. *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* officially holds the record with a net budget of $447 million (although it is possible that *Avatar: The Way of Water* costs more if its price tag is towards the upper-end of its reported $350\u2013460 million production costs). The third and fourth *Avengers* films (*Infinity War* and *Endgame*) stand as the most expensive back-to-back film production, with combined production costs of over $1 billion, according to one of the directors.\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Besides the *Star Wars* and *Superman* franchises, *James Bond* and *Godzilla* films are still being released periodically; all four are among the highest-grossing franchises. Some of the older films that held the record of highest-grossing film still have respectable grosses by today's standards, but no longer compete numerically against today's top-earners in an era of much higher individual ticket prices. When those prices are adjusted for inflation, however, then *Gone with the Wind*\u2014which was the highest-grossing film outright for twenty-five years\u2014is still the highest-grossing film of all time. All grosses on the list are expressed in U.S. dollars at their nominal value, except where stated otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n## Highest-grossing films[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn this chart, films are ranked by the revenues from theatrical exhibition at their nominal value, along with the highest positions they attained.

All of the films have had a theatrical run (including re-releases) in the 21st century, and films that have not played during this period do not appear on the chart because of ticket-price inflation, population size and ticket purchasing trends not being considered.\n\n\n\n\n\u2020 *Background shading indicates films playing in the week commencing 13 June 2024 in theaters around the world*.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n51. **^** Schickel, Richard (1996). *D.

Amblin Entertainment and Touchstone Pictures placed the actual expenditure on the film itself at around $50 million,[226] but it is not clear if the figures for the other films on the list include or exclude the overhead. Interest payments on the budget came to $17,105,000 which brought the full financial commitment on production to over $75 million.[225]\n44. ^ ***a*** ***b*** 20th Century Fox put the official budget of James Cameron's *The Abyss* (1989) at $43 million;[229] however, some estimates place the true cost as high as $70 million, which would have made it the most expensive film made up to that point.[230]\n45. **^** Estimates put the budget for *True Lies* between $100 million[237][238] and $120 million,[114] but either way it was still the first film to cost over $100 million.[236]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe most expensive film of the silent era was *Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ* (1925),[139] costing about $4 million\u2014twenty-five times the $160,000 average cost of an MGM feature.[212] It is unclear which sound-era production superseded it as the most expensive film, although this is commonly attributed to *Hell's Angels* (1930), directed by Howard Hughes; the accounts for *Hell's Angels* show it cost $2.8 million, but Hughes publicised it as costing $4 million, selling it to the media as the most expensive film ever made.[214] The first film to seriously challenge the record was *Gone with the Wind*, reported to have cost about $3.9\u20134.25 million,[139] although sources from the time state that *Ben-Hur* and\u2014erroneously\u2014*Hell's Angels* cost more.[215] *Ben-Hur* was definitively displaced at the top of the chart by *Duel in the Sun* in 1946.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![The theatrical poster for Ben-Hur (1925) depicting a man behaving in a sexually aggressive manner towards a woman cowering from him.](image)*Ben-Hur* (1925) was the most expensive film of the silent era, possibly holding the record for over twenty years.\nDue to the secretive nature of Hollywood accounting, it is not clear which film is the most expensive film ever made. *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* officially holds the record with a net budget of $447 million (although it is possible that *Avatar: The Way of Water* costs more if its price tag is towards the upper-end of its reported $350\u2013460 million production costs). The third and fourth *Avengers* films (*Infinity War* and *Endgame*) stand as the most expensive back-to-back film production, with combined production costs of over $1 billion, according to one of the directors.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nInflation, filming techniques and external market forces affect the economics of film production. Costs rose steadily during the silent era with *Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ* (1925) setting a record that lasted well into the sound era. Television had an impact on rising costs in the 1950s and early 1960s as cinema competed with it for audiences, culminating in 1963 with *Cleopatra*; despite being the highest earning film of the year, *Cleopatra* did not earn back its costs on its original release. The 1990s saw two thresholds crossed, with *True Lies* costing $100 million in 1994 and *Titanic* costing $200 million in 1997, both directed by James Cameron. Since then it has become normal for a tent-pole feature from a major film studio to cost over $100 million and an increasing number of films are costing $200 million or more.\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Besides the *Star Wars* and *Superman* franchises, *James Bond* and *Godzilla* films are still being released periodically; all four are among the highest-grossing franchises. Some of the older films that held the record of highest-grossing film still have respectable grosses by today's standards, but no longer compete numerically against today's top-earners in an era of much higher individual ticket prices. When those prices are adjusted for inflation, however, then *Gone with the Wind*\u2014which was the highest-grossing film outright for twenty-five years\u2014is still the highest-grossing film of all time. All grosses on the list are expressed in U.S. dollars at their nominal value, except where stated otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n## Highest-grossing films[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n99. **^** Robertson, Patrick (1991). *Guinness Book of Movie Facts and Feats* (4\u00a0ed.).
