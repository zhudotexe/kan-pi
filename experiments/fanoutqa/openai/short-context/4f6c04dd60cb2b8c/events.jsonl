Nadal won four consecutive titles on two separate occasions from 2005 to 2008 and 2017–2020, and an open era record of five consecutive titles from 2010 to 2014.\nThe French Open was established in 1891 and was originally known as the French Championships.[10] The tournament was only open to French players or foreign players who were a member of a French club during the first 34 years of its existence.[11] The first winner of the Championship was the British player H. Briggs, a member of Club Stade Français which entitled him to compete.[12] Records show matches were played as the best-of-three sets format until 1902 or 1903, when best-of-five sets was adopted. French players were dominant in the early stages of the tournament, in particular Max Decugis, who won eight titles before the outbreak of the First World War.[13]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| ![](image) Romania (ROU) | 0\n | 1\n | 1\n | 1973 | 1973 |\n| ![](image) Ecuador (ECU) | 0\n | 1\n | 1\n | 1990 | 1990 |\n| ![](image) Austria (AUT) | 0\n | 1\n | 1\n | 1995 | 1995 |\n| ![](image) Russia (RUS) | 0\n | 1\n | 1\n | 1996 | 1996 |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Tennis portal\n\n\n**French Open other competitions**\n\n\n\n* List of French Open women's singles champions\n* List of French Open men's doubles champions\n* List of French Open women's doubles champions\n* List of French Open mixed doubles champions\n\n\n**Grand Slam men's singles**\n\n\n\n* List of Australian Open men's singles champions\n* List of Wimbledon gentlemen's singles champions\n* List of US Open men's singles champions\n* List of Grand Slam men's singles champions\n\n\n**Other events**\n\n\n\n* French Pro Championship\n* World Hard Court Championships\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nFrench Open\n |\n| --- |\n| * Men's singles\n* Women's singles\n* Men's doubles\n* Women's doubles\n* Mixed doubles\n |\n| Pre Open Era | * 1925\n* 1926\n* 1927\n* 1928\n* 1929\n* 1930\n* 1931\n* 1932\n* 1933\n* 1934\n* 1935\n* 1936\n* 1937\n* 1938\n* 1939\n* 1940\n* 1941\n* 1942\n* 1943\n* 1944\n* 1945\n* 1946\n* 1947\n* 1948\n* 1949\n* 1950\n* 1951\n* 1952\n* 1953\n* 1954\n* 1955\n* 1956\n* 1957\n* 1958\n* 1959\n* 1960\n* 1961\n* 1962\n* 1963\n* 1964\n* 1965\n* 1966\n* 1967\n |\n| Open Era | * 1968\n* 1969\n* 1970\n* 1971\n* 1972\n* 1973\n* 1974\n* 1975\n* 1976\n* 1977\n* 1978\n* 1979\n* 1980\n* 1981\n* 1982\n* 1983\n* 1984\n* 1985\n* 1986\n* 1987\n* 1988\n* 1989\n* 1990\n* 1991\n* 1992\n* 1993\n* 1994\n* 1995\n* 1996\n* 1997\n* 1998\n* 1999\n* 2000\n* 2001\n* 2002\n* 2003\n* 2004\n* 2005\n* 2006\n* 2007\n* 2008\n* 2009\n* 2010\n* 2011\n* 2012\n* 2013\n* 2014\n* 2015\n* 2016\n* 2017\n* 2018\n* 2019\n* 2020\n* 2021\n* 2022\n* 2023\n* 2024\n |\n| * Open Era finalists\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_hMgZDBMVlEbmq3LtCFEzxZwo","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

Organised by the Fédération Française de Tennis (FFT), the French Open is the second of the four Grand Slam tournaments of the year to be played.[2] In 1968, it was the first Grand Slam tournament to open to non-amateur players.\n\n\nThe winner of the men's singles event receives the Coupe des Mousquetaires, named after The Four Musketeers of French tennis: Jean Borotra, Jacques Brugnon, Henri Cochet, and René Lacoste.[3] The event was not held from 1915 to 1919 because of the First World War and was held unofficially as the Tournoi de France under German occupation from 1941 to 1944, during the Second World War.[4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFrench Open Men's Singles Champions| Location | Paris[a]France |\n| Venue | Stade Roland Garros |\n| Governing body | Fédération Française de Tennis (FFT) |\n| Created | 1891 (established)1925 (Grand Slam event) |\n| Editions | 127 events (2023)93 Grand Slam events (since 1925)56 events (Open Era) |\n| Surface | Red clay (since 1908)Sand / Clay (1892–1907)Grass (1891) |\n| Trophy | Coupe des Mousquetaires |\n| Website | French Open champions |\n| Most titles |\n| **14**: Rafael Nadal |\n| Current champion |\n| Novak Djokovic(Third title) |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![Rafael Nadal at the 2011 French Open](image)Rafael Nadal, who has won an all-time record fourteen French Open titles.

Briggs, a member of Club Stade Français which entitled him to compete.[12] Records show matches were played as the best-of-three sets format until 1902 or 1903, when best-of-five sets was adopted. French players were dominant in the early stages of the tournament, in particular Max Decugis, who won eight titles before the outbreak of the First World War.[13]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Henri Cochet, the most successful French player since the tournament became open in 1925.

The tournament was reserved for members of French tennis clubs until the first edition open to international players took place in 1925.[5] From 1941 to 1944, the tournament took place under Vichy regime, won two times by Alice Weiwers and once by Simone Iribarne Lafargue, and Raymonde Jones Veber. Those editions are not counted by the FFT in the tournament's history, and were retroactively named *Tournoi de France*.[2] In 1945, under the Provisional Government of the French Republic, the champion was Lolette Payot. Even if it was organised by the French Lawn Tennis Federation, the 1945 event is also not counted by the FFT in the tournament's history.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nFrench Open singles drawsheets\n |\n| --- |\n| Men's singles | * 1968\n* 1969\n* 1970\n* 1971\n* 1972\n* 1973\n* 1974\n* 1975\n* 1976\n* 1977\n* 1978\n* 1979\n* 1980\n* 1981\n* 1982\n* 1983\n* 1984\n* 1985\n* 1986\n* 1987\n* 1988\n* 1989\n* 1990\n* 1991\n* 1992\n* 1993\n* 1994\n* 1995\n* 1996\n* 1997\n* 1998\n* 1999\n* 2000\n* 2001\n* 2002\n* 2003\n* 2004\n* 2005\n* 2006\n* 2007\n* 2008\n* 2009\n* 2010\n* 2011\n* 2012\n* 2013\n* 2014\n* 2015\n* 2016\n* 2017\n* 2018\n* 2019\n* 2020\n* 2021\n* 2022\n* 2023\n* 2024\n |\n| Women's singles | * 1968\n* 1969\n* 1970\n* 1971\n* 1972\n* 1973\n* 1974\n* 1975\n* 1976\n* 1977\n* 1978\n* 1979\n* 1980\n* 1981\n* 1982\n* 1983\n* 1984\n* 1985\n* 1986\n* 1987\n* 1988\n* 1989\n* 1990\n* 1991\n* 1992\n* 1993\n* 1994\n* 1995\n* 1996\n* 1997\n* 1998\n* 1999\n* 2000\n* 2001\n* 2002\n* 2003\n* 2004\n* 2005\n* 2006\n* 2007\n* 2008\n* 2009\n* 2010\n* 2011\n* 2012\n* 2013\n* 2014\n* 2015\n* 2016\n* 2017\n* 2018\n* 2019\n* 2020\n* 2021\n* 2022\n* 2023\n* 2024\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe French Open is played during two weeks in late May and early June, and has been chronologically the second of the four Grand Slam tournaments of the tennis season since 1987.
