Of this, the winners, FunPlus Phoenix, received 37.5% ($834,375) of the pool. For coming second, G2 was rewarded 13.5% ($300,375).[61] Alongside this, the prize pool is increased through a percentage of the commissions from the year's promotional \"Championship\" skin\u2014a form of virtual cosmetic that modifies the look of the player's champion.[62] Championship skins are given to champions that are seen consistently in the professional leagues and tournaments that year. 2019's Championship skin was given to Ryze, who had a 95.2% presence at the 2019 Mid-Season Invitational.[63] As with previous world champions, FPX worked directly with Riot's visual department to release skins for their chosen champions, with one per player. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n69. **^** Rand, Emily (1 November 2020). \"How DAMWON dismantled Suning in League of Legends World Championship final\".
