Microsoft's best-known software products are the Windows line of operating systems, the Microsoft 365 suite of productivity applications, and the Edge web browser. Its flagship hardware products are the Xbox video game consoles and the Microsoft Surface lineup of touchscreen personal computers. Microsoft ranked No. 14 in the 2022 Fortune 500 rankings of the largest United States corporations by total revenue;[2] it was the world's largest software maker by revenue as of 2022.

As of 2023[update], Microsoft has the third-highest global brand valuation.\n\n\nMicrosoft has been criticized for its monopolistic practices and the company's software has been criticized for problems with ease of use, robustness, and security.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Microsoft\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Microsoft.\n\n### 1972–1985: Founding[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Mainframes | * Fujitsu\n* HPE\n* IBM\n |\n| See also\nLargest IT companies\nComputer hardware manufacturers\nHome computer hardware companies\nServer hardware\nMainframe computers\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nMajor Internet companies\n |\n| --- |\n| Companies with an annual revenue of over US$4 billion\n |\n| Internet  | * Adobe\n* Alibaba\n* Alphabet\n\t+ Google\n* Amazon\n* Apple\n* Baidu\n* IAC\n* Kakao\n* Meituan\n* Meta\n\t+ Facebook\n* Microsoft\n* Naver\n* NetEase\n* Tencent\n* Yandex\n |\n| Cloud computing | * Akamai\n* Alibaba Cloud\n* AWS\n* Apple iCloud\n* Google\n* IBM\n* Microsoft Azure\n* Oracle Corporation\n* Salesforce\n* ServiceNow\n |\n| E-commerce | * Amazon.com\n* Apple\n* Booking Holdings\n* Coupang\n* eBay\n* Expedia\n* Flipkart\n* Groupon\n* JD.com\n* Lazada\n* Mercado Libre\n* Rakuten\n* Shopee\n* Shopify\n* Suning.com\n* Trip.com\n* Uber\n* Wayfair\n* Zalando\n |\n| Media | * Bloomberg\n* BuzzFeed\n* ByteDance\n* Kuaishou\n* Netflix\n* Paramount Streaming\n* Spotify\n* Warner Bros.

Its total market value was over $410B—with the stock price hitting $50.04 a share, the highest since early 2000.[180] In 2015, Reuters reported that Microsoft Corp had earnings abroad of $76.4 billion which were untaxed by the Internal Revenue Service.
