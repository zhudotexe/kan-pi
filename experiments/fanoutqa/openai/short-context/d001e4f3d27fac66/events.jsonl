Some of the most common non-official first languages include Mandarin (679,255 first-language speakers), Punjabi (666,585), Cantonese (553,380), Spanish (538,870), Arabic (508,410), Tagalog (461,150), Italian (319,505), German (272,865), and Tamil (237,890).[339] Canada's federal government practises official bilingualism, which is applied by the commissioner of official languages in consonance with section 16 of the *Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms* and the federal *Official Languages Act*. English and French have equal status in federal courts, Parliament, and in all federal institutions. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOther provinces have no official languages as such, but French is used as a language of instruction, in courts, and for other government services, in addition to English. Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec allow for both English and French to be spoken in the provincial legislatures and laws are enacted in both languages. In Ontario, French has some legal status, but is not fully co-official.[362] There are 11 Indigenous language groups, composed of more than 65 distinct languages and dialects.[363] Several Indigenous languages have official status in the Northwest Territories.[364] Inuktitut is the majority language in Nunavut and is one of three official languages in the territory.[365]\n\n\nAdditionally, Canada is home to many sign languages, some of which are Indigenous.[366] American Sign Language (ASL) is used across the country due to the prevalence of ASL in primary and secondary schools.[367] Quebec Sign Language (LSQ) is used primarily in Quebec.[368]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nCitizens have the right, where there is sufficient demand, to receive federal government services in either English or French and official-language minorities are guaranteed their own schools in all provinces and territories.[357]\n\n\nThe 1977 *Charter of the French Language* established French as the official language of Quebec.[358] Although more than 82 percent of French-speaking Canadians live in Quebec, there are substantial Francophone populations in New Brunswick, Alberta, and Manitoba; Ontario has the largest French-speaking population outside Quebec.[359] New Brunswick, the only officially bilingual province, has a French-speaking Acadian minority constituting 33 percent of the population.[360] There are also clusters of Acadians in southwestern Nova Scotia, on Cape Breton Island, and in central and western Prince Edward Island.[361]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBetween 2011 and 2016, the visible minority population rose by 18.4 percent.[352] In 1961, about 300,000 people, less than two percent of Canada's population, were members of visible minority groups.[353] The 2021 census indicated that 8.3 million people, or almost one-quarter (23.0 percent) of the population, reported themselves as being or having been a landed immigrant or permanent resident in Canada—above the 1921 census previous record of 22.3 percent.[354] In 2021, India, China, and the Philippines were the top three countries of origin for immigrants moving to Canada.[355]\n\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of Canada\n\n![Map of Canada with English speakers and French speakers at a percentage](image)Approximately 98 percent of Canadians can speak either or both English and French:[356]English – 57%\nEnglish and French – 16%\nFrench – 21%\nSparsely populated area ( < 0.4 persons per km2)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n363. **^** \"Aboriginal languages\".

Education in both English and French is available in most places across Canada.[406] Canada has a large number of universities, almost all of which are publicly funded.[407] Established in 1663, Université Laval is the oldest post-secondary institution in Canada.[408] The largest university is the University of Toronto with over 85,000 students.[409] Four universities are regularly ranked among the top 100 world-wide, namely University of Toronto, University of British Columbia, McGill University, and McMaster University, with a total of 18 universities ranked in the top 500 worldwide.[410]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHistorically, Canada has been influenced by British, French, and Indigenous cultures and traditions. Through their language, art, and music, Indigenous peoples continue to influence the Canadian identity.[437] During the 20th century, Canadians with African, Caribbean, and Asian nationalities have added to the Canadian identity and its culture.[438]\n\n\n\n### Symbols[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: National symbols of Canada and Canadian royal symbols\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n8. **^** The Government of Canada and Standards Council of Canada prescribe ISO 8601 as the country's official all-numeric date format: Public Works and Government Services Canada Translation Bureau (1997). \"5.14: Dates\". *The Canadian style: A guide to writing and editing* (Revised ed.).

In turn, these may be grouped into four main regions: Western Canada, Central Canada, Atlantic Canada, and Northern Canada (*Eastern Canada* refers to Central Canada and Atlantic Canada together).[261] Provinces and territories have responsibility for social programs such as healthcare, education, and welfare,[262] as well as administration of justice (but not criminal law). Together, the provinces collect more revenue than the federal government, a rarity among other federations in the world. Using its spending powers, the federal government can initiate national policies in provincial areas such as health and child care; the provinces can opt out of these cost-share programs but rarely do so in practice. Equalization payments are made by the federal government to ensure reasonably uniform standards of services and taxation are kept between the richer and poorer provinces.[263]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_liR64x1N8fMOWdTxg8kN03S2","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
