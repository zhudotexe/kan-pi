He lived in a yaodong in the village of Liangjiahe, Shaanxi province, where he joined the CCP after several failed attempts and worked as the local party secretary. After studying chemical engineering at Tsinghua University as a worker-peasant-soldier student, Xi rose through the ranks politically in China's coastal provinces. Xi was governor of Fujian from 1999 to 2002, before becoming governor and party secretary of neighboring Zhejiang from 2002 to 2007.

He was promoted in 1983 to secretary, becoming the top official of the county.[23] Xi subsequently served in four provinces during his regional political career: Hebei (1982\u20131985), Fujian (1985\u20132002), Zhejiang (2002\u20132007), and Shanghai (2007).[24] Xi held posts in the Fuzhou Municipal Party Committee and became the president of the Party School in Fuzhou in 1990. In 1997, he was named an alternate member of the 15th Central Committee of the CCP. However, of the 151 alternate members of the Central Committee elected at the 15th Party Congress, Xi received the lowest number of votes in favour, placing him last in the rankings of members, ostensibly due to his status as a princeling.[b][25]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n5. **^** Xu, Xinyi (27 May 2013). \u7fd2\u8fd1\u5e73\"\u5bb6\u98a8\"\u63ed\u79d8 \u9f4a\u5fc3\u81ea\u8ff0\u8207\u7fd2\u4ef2\u52db\u5a5a\u59fb\u5f80\u4e8b [Xi Jinping's \"family traditions\" are unmasked: Qi Xin's autobiographical account of her marriage to Xi Zhongxun]. *People's Daily* (in Traditional Chinese).

Since assuming power, Xi has introduced far-ranging measures to enforce party discipline and to impose internal unity. His anti-corruption campaign led to the downfall of prominent incumbent and retired CCP officials, including Zhou Yongkang, a former member of the PSC. He has also enacted or promoted a more aggressive foreign policy, particularly with regard to China's relations with the U.S., the nine-dash line in the South China Sea, the Sino-Indian border dispute, and the political status of Taiwan. He has sought to expand China's African and Eurasian influence through the Belt and Road Initiative. Xi has expanded support for state-owned enterprises (SOEs), advanced military-civil fusion, overseen targeted poverty alleviation programs, and has attempted to reform the property sector. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n28. **^** Tiezzi, Shannon (4 November 2014). \"From Fujian, China's Xi Offers Economic Olive Branch to Taiwan\". *The Diplomat*.

He was ranked above Li Keqiang, an indication that he was going to succeed Hu Jintao as China's next leader. In addition, Xi also held the first secretary of the CCP's Central Secretariat. This assessment was further supported at the 11th National People's Congress in March 2008, when Xi was elected as vice president of the PRC.[38] Following his elevation, Xi held a broad range of portfolios. He was put in charge of the comprehensive preparations for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, as well as being the central government's leading figure in Hong Kong and Macau affairs. In addition, he also became the new president of the Central Party School of the CCP, its cadre-training and ideological education wing. In the wake of the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, Xi visited disaster areas in Shaanxi and Gansu. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nA few months before his ascendancy to the party leadership, Xi disappeared from official media coverage and cancelled meeting with foreign officials for several weeks beginning on 1 September 2012, causing rumors.[8] He then reappeared on 15 September.[59] On 15 November 2012, Xi was elected to the posts of general secretary of the CCP and chairman of the CMC by the 18th Central Committee of the CCP. This made him, informally, the paramount leader and the first to be born after the founding of the PRC. \n</fragment>\n</document>",

Though his father owned a small tea trading business in Taizhou, the family was relatively poor. His mother was a teacher and died when he was 7, and he was raised by an aunt. Hu's father was denounced during the Cultural Revolution, an event that (together with his relatively humble origins) apparently had a deep effect upon Hu, who diligently tried to clear his father's name.[6]\n\n\nHe joined the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in April 1964.

Deng also proposed considering another candidate for a further future transition, preferably someone under fifty to represent the next generation of leaders.[29] Song Ping, as the organization chief, recommended Hu as an ideal candidate for the prospect of a future leader. As a result, shortly before his 50th birthday, Hu Jintao became the youngest (aged 49 in October 1992) member of the seven-member Politburo Standing Committee, and one of the youngest PSC members since the Communist Party assumed power in 1949.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Ewing, Richard Daniel. \"Hu Jintao: The Making of a Chinese General Secretary.\" *China Quarterly* 173 (2003): 17\u201334. online\n* Lam, Willy. *Chinese politics in the Hu Jintao era: New leaders, new challenges* (Routledge, 2016).\n* Miller, Alice. \"Hu Jintao and the Sixth Plenum\". *China Leadership Monitor* 20 (2007): 1\u201312. online\n* Nathan, Andrew J.; Gilley, Bruce (March 2003). *China's new rulers: the secret files*.

His tenure was characterized by collective leadership and consensus-based rule.[2] These traits made Hu a rather enigmatic figure in the public eye. His administration was known for its focus more on technocratic competence than persona.[3] At the end of his tenure after ten years in office, Hu won praise for retiring voluntarily from all positions. He was succeeded by Xi Jinping. Following the death of his predecessor Jiang Zemin, Hu is the only living former paramount leader of the People's Republic of China.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life, education, and family[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hu's birthplace, Jiangyan, Jiangsu.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1973, Hu was transferred to the Construction Department of Gansu as a secretary. The next year he was promoted to deputy senior party secretary. In 1980, Deng Xiaoping implemented the \"Four Transformations\" program, which aimed to produce communist leaders who were \"more revolutionary, younger, more knowledgeable, and more specialized.\" In response to this nationwide search for young party members, Song Ping, the first secretary of CCP Gansu Committee (Gansu's governor) discovered Hu Jintao and promoted him several ranks to the position of deputy head of the commission.[18] Another prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Song, Wen Jiabao, also became prominent at the same time.\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

His official obituary described him as \"a great proletarian revolutionary, a statesman, a military strategist, a staunch Marxist, an outstanding leader of the party, the state, and the people's army.\"[7]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nIn 1929, he married Li Bozhao, a woman who participated in the Long March alongside Yang.

As the Director of the General Office and Secretary\u2013General of the CMC, he oversaw much of the actual day-to-day work of most party activities and military affairs.[3] On the eve of the Cultural Revolution Yang was identified as a supporter of Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping, and was purged as a counter-revolutionary.[7] After being ejected from the Communist Party and removed from all positions, Yang was persecuted by Red Guards, who accused Yang of planting a covert listening device to spy on Mao, the same accusation shared by Deng Xiaoping.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nYang was born to a land-owning family[3] in Shuangjiang, Tongnan County, near the city of Chongqing in Sichuan, and studied at Chengdu Higher Normal School and its affiliated secondary school in 1920\u201325, and then returned to Chongqing. His older brother, Yang Yingong[4] was one of the founding Executive Committee members of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in Sichuan, and influenced Yang Shangkun's ideological orientation. After joining the Communist Youth League in 1925, and the CCP in 1926, he enrolled in Shanghai University, where he studied politics.[5] Later in 1927 Yang traveled to the Soviet Union and enrolled at the Moscow Sun Yat-sen University, where he studied Marxist theory and techniques of political organization and mobilization.[2][3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"\u65cf\u8c31\u5e2e\u5927\u5fd9\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u6768\u5c1a\u6606\u8bde\u8fb0\u65e5\u4e3a8\u67083\u65e5--\u4e2d\u56fd\u5171\u4ea7\u515a\u65b0\u95fb--\u4e2d\u56fd\u5171\u4ea7\u515a\u65b0\u95fb-\u4eba\u6c11\u7f51\".

He went on to hold high office under both Mao Zedong and later Deng Xiaoping; from 1945 to 1965 he was Director of the General Office and from 1945 to 1956 Secretary\u2013General of the Central Military Commission (CMC). In these positions, Yang oversaw much of the day-to-day running of government and Party affairs, both political and military, amassing a great deal of bureaucratic power by controlling things like the flow of documents, the keeping of records, and the approval and allocation of funds.[2] Purged, arrested and imprisoned during the Cultural Revolution, he spent 12 years in prison but staged a comeback in 1978, becoming a key ally of Deng, serving as Mayor of Guangzhou (1979\u201381), and returning to the CMC as Secretary\u2013General and also Vice Chairman (1981\u201389), before assuming the presidency.[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Yang (first row, fifth from right) at Kim Il Sung's 80th birthday celebrations in 1992\nThroughout the 1980s and early 1990s, Yang Shangkun was hugely influential within the People's Liberation Army. Yang and his younger half-brother, Yang Baibing, purged China's military of any officers who had not sufficiently supported the government's violent crackdown on students. Yang then began an organized attempt to fill as many senior military positions as possible with his supporters, generating an attitude of resentment among other military elders, who accused Yang of attempting to dominate the army and possibly challenge Deng's authority by developing a \"Yang family clique\". When Yang resisted the rise of Jiang Zemin (who had been the Party secretary of Shanghai), whom Deng began to groom to succeed him as paramount leader, party elders, including Deng himself forced Yang to retire in 1993, along with some of his family.[7]\n\n\n\n## Later life[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOne of the earliest supporters of Chinese economic reform, Yang justified it with references to Vladimir Lenin and the New Economic Policy. However, he strongly opposed any form of political reform, and, despite his own suffering during the Cultural Revolution, actively defended the image and record of Mao. Together with his half-brother, General Yang Baibing, Yang Shangkun effectively controlled the PLA for the entire 1980s and into the early 1990s. Despite his initial hesitation, he went on to play a leading role in crushing the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and was actually the one who planned and supervised the operations to clear the square and surrounding streets. Yang's downfall came in 1993, when he failed in his attempts to undermine the new leadership of Jiang Zemin and to retain control of the PLA, and was forced to retire by a coalition of Party elders, including Deng himself.\n\n\n\n\n## Early political and military activities[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| **In office**21 December 1964\u00a0\u2013 13 January 1975 |\n| Constituency | PLA At-large |\n| **In office**25 March 1988\u00a0\u2013 15 March 1993 |\n| Constituency | Sichuan At-large |\n| 7th Mayor of Guangzhou |\n| **In office**March 1979\u00a0\u2013 September 1981 |\n| Preceded by | Jiao Linyi |\n| Succeeded by | Liang Lingguang |\n|  |\n| Personal details |\n| Born | (1907-08-03)3 August 1907Tongnan, Chongqing, Sichuan, Qing Empire |\n| Died | 14 September 1998(1998-09-14) (aged\u00a091)Beijing, People's Republic of China |\n| Nationality | Chinese |\n| Political party | Chinese Communist Party (joined in 1926) |\n| Spouse | \nLi Bozhao\n\n\u200b\n \u200b\n(m.\u00a01929; died\u00a01985)\u200b\n |\n| Relations | Yang Baibing |\n| Children | 3 |\n| Alma mater | Shanghai University, Moscow Sun Yat-sen University |\n|  |\n\n\n\n\n| Yang Shangkun |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Simplified Chinese | \u6768\u5c1a\u6606 |\n| Traditional\u00a0Chinese | \u694a\u5c1a\u6606 |\n| \n\n| Transcriptions |\n| --- |\n| Standard Mandarin |\n| Hanyu Pinyin | Y\u00e1ng Sh\u00e0ngk\u016bn |\n| Yue: Cantonese |\n| Jyutping | Joeng4 Soeng6-kwan1 |\n\n |\n|  |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring the Second Sino\u2013Japanese War Yang Shangkun was Deputy Secretary of the CCP North China Bureau and worked with Liu Shaoqi behind the Japanese lines. In January 1939, Yang became Secretary of the North China Bureau and worked with Zhu De and Peng Dehuai to cooperate with the military operations of the Eighth Route Army, including the Hundred Regiments Campaign. In 1941, Yang returned to Yan'an and worked as personal aide to Mao. In 1945, he became the Director of the General Office of the Party, as well as Secretary\u2013General of the Central Military Commission, that was chaired by Mao himself. In these capacities, he was responsible for much of the day-to-day administration of the Party's military and political work, and carried out this duty with much success.[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFile:Bush and Yang 5-1987.jpgYang with Vice President George H.

In practice, party and state leaders still deferred to paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, who, however, was not all-powerful, as he still had to compromise on some policies with other party elders such as Chen Yun and Li Xiannian.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Domes, Jurgen. *Peng Te-huai: The Man and the Image*, London: C.

On his return from Moscow in 1931, Yang Shangkun started his military career in the Chinese Red Army, serving as Director of the Political Department in the 1st Red Army and moving around different battle areas under the command of Zhu De and Zhou Enlai. In January 1934, he was appointed Political Commissar of the 3rd Red Army, commanded by Peng Dehuai.[6]\n\n\n\n## Second Sino\u2013Japanese War and Chinese Civil War[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nYang remained in prison until Mao died and Deng Xiaoping rose to power, in 1978. After Deng gained control of the military he recalled Yang, raised him to the position of general, and gave Yang the responsibility of reforming China's army, which Deng considered as larger than necessary and engaged in too many non-military activities. Deng raised Yang to the position of Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission in order to give Yang the authority to complete these reforms (Deng was chairman). In 1982 Yang was also appointed as a full member of the Politburo.[8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Political offices\n |\n| --- |\n| Preceded\u00a0byJiao Linyi\n |  **Chairman of the Guangzhou Revolutionary Committee** 1979\u20131981\n | Succeeded\u00a0byLiang Lingguang\n***as Mayor of Guangzhou*** |\n| Preceded\u00a0byPeng Zhen\n |  **Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress** 1980\u20131983\n | Succeeded\u00a0byWang Hanbin\n |\n| Preceded\u00a0byLi Xiannian\n |  **President of the People's Republic of China** 1988\u20131993\n | Succeeded\u00a0byJiang Zemin\n |\n| Preceded\u00a0byZhao Ziyang\n |  **First Vice Chairman of the PRC Central Military Commission** 1989\u20131993\n | Succeeded\u00a0byLiu Huaqing\n |\n| Party political offices\n |\n| Preceded\u00a0byLi Fuchun\n |  **Chief of the General Office of the Chinese Communist Party** 1945\u20131965\n | Succeeded\u00a0byWang Dongxing\n |\n| Preceded\u00a0bynone\n |  **Secretary-General of the CCP Central Military Commission** 1945\u20131956\n | Succeeded\u00a0byHuang Kecheng\n |\n| Preceded\u00a0byGeng Biao\n |  **Secretary-General of the CCP Central Military Commission** 1981\u20131989\n | Succeeded\u00a0byYang Baibing\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Other members*in surname stroke order* | * Wan Li\n* Tian Jiyun\n* Jiang Zemin (to PSC 1989)\n* Li Tieying\n* Li Ruihuan (to PSC 1989)\n* Li Ximing\n* Yang Rudai\n* Yang Shangkun\n* Wu Xueqian\n* Song Ping (to PSC 1989)\n* Hu Yaobang (died Apr 1989)\n* Qin Jiwei\n |\n| Alternate member | * Ding Guangen\n |\n| 7th\u21928th\u21929th\u219210th\u219211th\u219212th\u219213th\u219214th\u219215th\u219216th\u219217th\u219218th\u219219th\u219220th\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n12th Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party (1982\u20131987)\n |\n| --- |\n| Standing Committee | 1.

Although according to the 1982 Constitution the role of President was \"largely ceremonial\", it recognized Li's status as a respected Party elder and a member of the CCP Politburo Standing Committee, and Li himself went on to forcefully use his still very substantial influence to support leftist policies. In 1984, Li met with U.S. President Ronald Reagan during the latter's visit to China, notably discussing the status of Taiwan with the President.[10] Li visited the United States in July 1985, the first time the head of state of the People's Republic of China made such a visit.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs the decade progressed, Deng Xiaoping, always an opponent of lifetime tenure in office, gradually convinced most of the party elders to retire. Li stepped down as president in 1988 and was succeeded by Yang Shangkun. Li was then named Chairman of the National Committee of the CPPCC. He was a strong supporter of Jiang Zemin's rise to power,[*citation needed*] and during the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, Li was one of the hardline Party elders who pushed for a strong response to the demonstrations and supported Premier Li Peng's desire to use military force to suppress the protests.[5][11][12] Li continued to serve in government until his death in 1992.\n\n\n\n## Family[edit]\n\n\nLi had four children. His youngest daughter, Li Xiaolin, is the President of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries.

Li played a key role in blocking privatizations and maintaining state control in many sectors of the economy, promoted classical Communist political and cultural values through his patronage of theorists such as Hu Qiaomu and Deng Liqun, and was instrumental in purging liberals Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang.

He joined the Communist Party in December 1927 and became a soldier in the Chinese Red Army. After studying at the Military\u2013Political University and the Central Party School, he became an influential and successful military commander during the Second Sino\u2013Japanese War and the Chinese Civil War, distinguishing himself in the Huai\u2013Hai Campaign.[4] After the PRC was established, he served as Governor and Party Secretary of his native Hubei Province from 1949 to 1954, and then joined the central leadership in Beijing, serving as Minister of Finance (1954\u20131970) and Vice Premier (1954\u20131982).
