The country is secular and the freedom of religion is enshrined in the nation's constitution.\n\n\nThe pre-Hispanic peoples that lived in actual Honduras were primarily polytheistic Maya and other native groups. In the 16th century, Roman Catholicism was introduced by the Spanish Empire and still holds a 46% share of the population. Protestantism accounts for 41% of the country's population.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Ancient religion[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nForeign missionaries must register with the government. Some religious groups have reached agreements with the government to expedite this process;[4] however, some groups have noted difficulties in obtaining visas for longer than six months. \n\n\nConscientious objection to military service is protected by law, including objection on religious grounds.[6]\n\n\nSome politicians, generally from opposition parties, have regularly used antisemitism rhetoric in their political statements.[6][*dead link*]\n\n\nIn 2023, the country was scored 4 out of 4 for religious freedom according to Freedom House.[7]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Islam in Honduras\n* Roman Catholicism in Honduras\n* Virgin of Suyapa, perhaps Honduras' most popular religious image.\n* Religion in Latin America\n* ![flag](image) Honduras portal\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Cathedral of Saint Michael the Archangel\nIn recent years, the principal religious groups are Roman Catholic, Episcopal, Lutheran, Jehovah's Witness, Mennonite, approximately 300 evangelical Protestant groups, and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and well as communities of Muslims, Jews and Baha'is.[4]\n\n\nThe Catholic Church in Honduras is composed of eight dioceses: Tegucigalpa, Comayagua, Choluteca, Olancho, Yoro, San Pedro Sula, Trujillo and Cop\u00e1n which are a part of the Conference Episcopal of Honduras.\n\n\nThe Protestant churches are structured by three confederacies: The Pastors' Association of Honduras, the Evangelical Brotherhood of Honduras and the Apostolic Network of Honduras.\n\n\nBoth the Roman Catholic Church as well as the Protestant churches, especially the Pentecostal denominations, have experienced growth thanks in large part to modern forms of mass communication in recent decades.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Mayan God Chaac in Copan sculpture museum\nThe Maya religion was the ancient one. It was practiced a lot in the timeline of the 4th and 7th century, AD. It was practiced in some parts of Central and South America, and it was based on polytheistic beliefs and had to do with a big number of rituals with occasional animals and maybe even human sacrifices. [*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Post-colonial religion[edit]\n\n\nThe second Roman Catholic Mass celebrated in the continental New World was on August 13, 1502, in Punta Caxinas, two weeks after the so-called \"discovery\" of Honduras by Christopher Columbus.[2][3] Thereafter, the Spanish began a process of converting and baptizing Honduran natives to the Catholic faith.\n\n\nHonduras holds a small part of the former Mosquito Coast which came under British influence\u2014now in the extreme southeast of the state. Protestant churches gained following in that sparsely populated area on the Caribbean coast, especially Anglicanism and the Moravian Church.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nReligion in the Americas\n |\n| --- |\n| * United States and Canada\n* Latin America and the Caribbean\n |\n| Regions | * Latin America\n\t+ Hispanic\n* North America\n\t+ Northern\n\t+ Caribbean\n\t+ Central America\n* South America\n | ![](image)\n |\n| Sovereign states | * Antigua and Barbuda\n* Argentina\n* Bahamas\n* Barbados\n* Belize\n* Bolivia\n* Brazil\n* Canada\n* Chile\n* Colombia\n* Costa Rica\n* Cuba\n* Dominica\n* Dominican Republic\n* Ecuador\n* El Salvador\n* Grenada\n* Guatemala\n* Guyana\n* Haiti\n* Honduras\n* Jamaica\n* Mexico\n* Nicaragua\n* Panama\n* Paraguay\n* Peru\n* Saint Kitts and Nevis\n* Saint Lucia\n* Saint Vincent and the Grenadines\n* Suriname\n* Trinidad and Tobago\n* United States\n* Uruguay\n* Venezuela\n |\n| Dependencies andother territories\n | * Anguilla\n* Aruba\n* Bermuda\n* Bonaire\n* British Virgin Islands\n* Cayman Islands\n* Cura\u00e7ao\n* Falkland Islands\n* French Guiana\n* Greenland\n* Guadeloupe\n* Martinique\n* Montserrat\n* Puerto Rico\n* Saba\n* Saint Barth\u00e9lemy\n* Saint Martin\n* Saint Pierre and Miquelon\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Catholic Apathy Leads To Growth Of Evangelical Christian Churches In Latin America\". *Ken on Threats*. 2022-11-16.

As of the 2012 census, 70.2% of Sri Lankans were Buddhists, 12.6% were Hindus, 9.7% were Muslims (mainly Sunni), 7.4% were Christians (mostly Catholics).[1][2] Buddhism is declared as the State religion of Sri Lanka and has been given special privileges in the Sri Lankan constitution such as the government is bound for protection and fostering of Buddhist Dharma throughout the nation.[3][4] However, the constitution also provides for freedom of religion and right to equality among all its citizens. In 2008 Sri Lanka was the third most religious country in the world according to a Gallup poll, with 99% of Sri Lankans saying religion is an important part of their daily life.[5]\n\n\n\n\n## Distribution of religious groups[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n18. **^** \"Table 2.13: Population by religion and census years\" (PDF). *Statistical Abstract 2013*.
