They set their own academic standards and manage their own budgets. The president, however, plays an important part in university-wide planning and strategy. Each names a faculty's dean (and, since the foundation of the office in 1994, the university's provost), and grants tenure to recommended professors; however, the president is expected to make such decisions after extensive consultation with faculty members.\n\n\nHarvard presidents have traditionally influenced educational practices nationwide. Charles W. Eliot, for example, originated America's familiar system of a smorgasbord of elective courses available to each student;[2] James B. Conant worked to introduce standardized testing; Derek Bok and Neil L. Rudenstine argued for the continued importance of diversity in higher education.\n\n\nRecently, however, the job has become increasingly administrative, especially as fund-raising campaigns have taken on central importance in large institutions such as Harvard. Some have criticized this trend to the extent it has prevented the president from focusing on substantive issues in higher education.[3]\n\n\nEach president is professor in some department of the university and teaches from time to time.\n\n\nHarvard's current president is Claudine Gay, having become Harvard's 30th president on July 1, 2023.[4]\n\n\nShe succeeded Lawrence Bacow who retired on June 30, 2023.[5]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nAt Harvard's founding it was headed by a \"schoolmaster,\" Nathaniel Eaton. In 1640, when Henry Dunster was brought in, he adopted the title president. The origins of this title have been grounds for a certain amount of speculation.\n\n\nHarvard was founded for the training of Puritan clergy, and even though its mission was soon broadened, nearly all presidents through the end of the 18th century were in holy orders.\n\n\nAll presidents from Leonard Hoar through Nathan Pusey were graduates of Harvard College. Of the presidents since Pusey, Bok earned his undergraduate degree at Stanford, Rudenstine at Princeton, and Summers and Bacow at MIT, but each earned a graduate degree at Harvard. Drew Gilpin Faust was the first president since the seventeenth century with no earned Harvard degree.\n\n\nJohn Winthrop served as acting president in 1769 and again in 1773; but both times he declined an offer of the full presidency on grounds of old age.\n\n\nOther minor acting presidents have included William Brattle, Edward Wigglesworth (1780\u20131781), Henry Ware (1810, 1828\u20131829), Andrew Preston Peabody (1862, 1868\u20131869), and Henry Pickering Walcott. Henry Rosovsky, former Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, served as acting president for three months in 1987 when Bok traveled abroad. Provost Albert Carnesale served as acting president for three months, from November 1994 to February 1995, during Rudenstine's leave of absence.

One of its ten founding ministers, Abraham Pierson, became its first Rector, the administrative and ecclesiastical head of the college. After Pierson, four more ministers served as rectors of the collegiate school, until 1745 when Yale College was chartered by the Colony of Connecticut and Thomas Clap's title was changed to president. In 1878, Yale incorporated as a university, and incumbent Timothy Dwight V became the last president of the college and the first of Yale University. The first president not ordained as a minister was Arthur Twining Hadley, inaugurated in 1899; no ordained person has held the office since.\n\n\nThe president is elected by the Yale Corporation, the governing body of the University on which the president sits *ex-officio*. The corporation's bylaws state that the president is \"chief executive officer of the University and as such is responsible for the general direction of all its affairs.\"[1] The president nominates other university officers, including the provost, secretary, and other vice presidents, for election by the corporation. Other top-level administrative positions, such as university chaplain, deans of schools, and masters of residential colleges, are appointed by the president alone.\n\n\nThe university's current president is Peter Salovey, a professor of social psychology who formerly served as University Provost and Dean of Yale College and received his Ph.D. from Yale's Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.\n\n\nThe Office of the President is located in Woodbridge Hall, a 1901 building erected specifically for administrative purpose.[2] The university maintains an official home for the president on Hillhouse Avenue, which hosts presidential events. Peter Salovey, inaugurated in 2013, is the first president since 1986 to use the home as his primary residence.[3]\n\n\n\n![](image)Ezra Stiles, by Samuel King\n## Rectors of Yale College (1701\u2013)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  | Rectors of Yale College[4] | birth\u2013death | years as rector\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Abraham Pierson | (1641\u20131707) | (1701\u20131707) Collegiate School\n |\n| 2 | Samuel Andrew | (1656\u20131738) | (1707\u20131719; *pro tempore*)\n |\n| 3 | Timothy Cutler | (1684\u20131765) | (1719\u20131726) 1718/9: renamed Yale College\n |\n| 4 | Elisha Williams | (1694\u20131755) | (1726\u20131739)\n |\n| 5 | Thomas Clap | (1703\u20131767) | (1740\u20131745)\n |\n\n\n## Presidents of Yale College (1740\u20131878) and Yale University (1878\u2013)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  | Presidents of Yale College[4] | birth\u2013death | years as president\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 5 | Thomas Clap | (1703\u20131767) | (1745\u20131766)\n |\n| 6 | Naphtali Daggett | (1727\u20131780) | (1766\u20131777; *pro tempore*) - presidency during the American Revolution\n |\n| 7 | Ezra Stiles | (1727\u20131795) | (1778\u20131795) - presidency during the American Revolution\n |\n| 8 | Timothy Dwight IV | (1752\u20131817) | (1795\u20131817)\n |\n| 9 | Jeremiah Day | (1773\u20131867) | (1817\u20131846)\n |\n| 10 | Theodore Dwight Woolsey | (1801\u20131889) | (1846\u20131871)\n |\n| 11 | Noah Porter III | (1811\u20131892) | (1871\u20131886)\n |\n| 12 | Timothy Dwight V | (1828\u20131916) | (1886\u20131899) 1887: renamed Yale University\n |\n| 13 | Arthur Twining Hadley | (1856\u20131930) | (1899\u20131921)\n |\n| 14 | James Rowland Angell | (1869\u20131949) | (1921\u20131937)\n |\n| 15 | Charles Seymour | (1885\u20131963) | (1937\u20131951)\n |\n| 16 | Alfred Whitney Griswold | (1906\u20131963) | (1951\u20131963)\n |\n| 17 | Kingman Brewster, Jr. | (1919\u20131988) | (1963\u20131977)\n |\n| 18 | Hanna Holborn Gray | (1930\u2013 ) | (1977\u20131978; pro tempore)\n |\n| 19 | A.

It is one of nine colonial colleges and was chartered prior to the U.S. Declaration of Independence when Benjamin Franklin, the university's founder and first president, advocated for an educational institution that trained leaders in academia, commerce, and public service. Penn identifies as the fourth oldest institution of higher education in the United States, though this representation is challenged by other universities, as Franklin first convened the Board of Trustees in 1749, arguably making it the fifth oldest institution of higher education in the U.S.[note 2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPenn alumni who are founders of technology companies include Ralph J. Roberts (co-founder of Comcast); Elon Musk (co-founder of PayPal, Tesla, OpenAI and Neuralink, founder of SpaceX and The Boring Company); Leonard Bosack (co-founder of Cisco); David J. Brown (co-founder of Silicon Graphics) and Mark Pincus (founder of Zynga, the company behind FarmVille).\n\n\nAmong other distinguished alumni are the current or past presidents of over one hundred universities including Harvard University (Drew Gilpin Faust, Harvard's first female president), Cornell University (Martha E. Pollack), Penn (Judith Rodin, first female president in the Ivy League), Princeton University (Harold Dodds), the University of California (Mark Yudof), Carnegie Mellon University (Jared Cohon), and Northwestern University (Morton O. Schapiro).[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSome eleven heads of state or government have been affiliated with Penn, former president Donald Trump;[505] former president William Henry Harrison, who attended the medical school for less than a semester;[506] current president Joe Biden, who served as a Benjamin Franklin Presidential Practice Professor and led the Penn Biden Center,[507] former prime minister of the Philippines Cesar Virata; the first president of Nigeria, Nnamdi Azikiwe; the first president of Ghana, Kwame Nkrumah; and the current president of Ivory Coast, Alassane Ouattara. Other notable politicians who hold a degree from Penn include India's former minister of state for finance Jayant Sinha,[508][509] former ambassador and Utah governor Jon Huntsman, Jr., Mexico's current minister of finance, Ernesto J. Cordero, former Pennsylvania senator Arlen Specter, and former Pennsylvania governor and DNC chair Ed Rendell.[510]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Penn in the 18th Century\". *upenn.edu*.

Its official corporate name is \"The Trustees of Columbia University in the City of New York\". The university's first charter was granted in 1754 by King George II; however, its modern charter was first enacted in 1787 and last amended in 1810 by the New York State Legislature. The university is governed by 24 trustees, customarily including the president, who serves *ex officio*. The trustees themselves are responsible for choosing their successors. Six of the 24 are nominated from a pool of candidates recommended by the Columbia Alumni Association. Another six are nominated by the board in consultation with the executive committee of the University Senate. The remaining 12, including the president, are nominated by the trustees themselves through their internal processes. The term of office for trustees is six years. Generally, they serve for no more than two consecutive terms. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nColumbia University| ![](image)Coat of arms\n |\n| Latin: *Universitas Columbiae* |\n| Former names\n | King's College(1754\u20131784)Columbia College(1784\u20131896)[1]:\u200a53\u201360 |\n| Motto | *In lumine Tuo videbimus lumen*\u00a0(Latin) |\n| Motto in\u00a0English\n | \"In Thy light shall we see light\"[2] |\n| Type | Private research university |\n| Established | May\u00a025, 1754; 270 years ago\u00a0(1754-05-25) |\n| Accreditation | MSCHE |\n| Academic affiliations\n | * AAU\n* NAICU\n* URA\n* Space-grant\n |\n| Endowment | $13.3 billion (2022)[3] |\n| President | Minouche Shafik |\n| Provost | Dennis Mitchell |\n| Academic staff\n | 4,370[4] |\n| Students | 34,782 (Fall 2022)[5] |\n| Undergraduates | 6,668 (Fall 2022)[n 1][5] |\n| Postgraduates | 25,880 (Fall 2022)[5] |\n| Location | New York\n, New York\n, United States\n40\u00b048\u203227\u2033N 73\u00b057\u203243\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff40.80750\u00b0N 73.96194\u00b0W\ufeff / 40.80750; -73.96194 |\n| Campus | Large city, 299 acres (1.21\u00a0km2) |\n| Newspaper | *Columbia Daily Spectator* |\n| Colors | Columbia blue\u00a0and\u00a0white[8]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 |\n| Nickname | Lions |\n| Sporting affiliations\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n3. **^** Three presidents have attended Columbia: Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin D.

For much of the 19th century, the university consisted of decentralized and separate faculties specializing in Political Science, Philosophy, and Pure Science. In 1979, these faculties were merged into the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.[92] In 1991, the faculties of Columbia College, the School of General Studies, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, the School of the Arts, and the School of Professional Studies were merged into the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, leading to the academic integration and centralized governance of these schools. In 2010, the School of International and Public Affairs, which was previously a part of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, became an independent faculty.[93]\n\n\n\n## Campus[edit]\n\n\n### Morningside Heights[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n193. **^** \"Edwin Howard Armstrong Memorial Award.

Prior to serving at the university, Johnson had participated in the First Continental Congress and been chosen as a delegate to the Constitutional Convention.[73] For a period in the 1790s, with New York City as the federal and state capital and the country under successive Federalist governments, a revived Columbia thrived under the auspices of Federalists such as Hamilton and Jay.

The Brown women's sailing team has won 5 national championships, most recently in 2019[216] while the coed sailing team won 2 national championships in 1942 and 1948.[217] Both teams are consistency ranked in the top 10 in the nation.[218]\n\n\nThe first intercollegiate ice hockey game in America was played between Brown and Harvard on January 19, 1898.[219] The first university rowing regatta larger than a dual-meet was held between Brown, Harvard, and Yale at Lake Quinsigamond in Massachusetts on July 26, 1859.[220][11]\n\n\nBrown also supports competitive intercollegiate club sports, including ultimate frisbee. The men's ultimate team, Brownian Motion, has won three national championships, in 2000, 2005, and 2019.[221]\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\n### Alumni[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Brown University alumni\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBrown University is accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education.[166] For their 2021 rankings, The Wall Street Journal/Times Higher Education ranked Brown 5th in the \"Best Colleges 2021\" edition.[167]\n\n\nThe *Forbes* magazine annual ranking of \"America's Top Colleges 2022\"\u2014which ranked 600 research universities, liberal arts colleges and service academies\u2014ranked Brown 19th overall and 18th among universities.[168]\n\n\n*U.S. News & World Report* ranked Brown 9th among national universities in its 2023 edition.[169] The 2022 edition also ranked Brown 2nd for undergraduate teaching, 25th in Most Innovative Schools, and 14th in Best Value Schools.[170]\n\n\n*Washington Monthly* ranked Brown 40th in 2022 among 442 national universities in the U.S. based on its contribution to the public good, as measured by social mobility, research, and promoting public service.[171]\n\n\nIn 2022, *U.S. News & World Report* ranks Brown 129th globally.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2014, *Forbes* magazine ranked Brown 7th on its list of \"America's Most Entrepreneurial Universities.\"[172] The *Forbes* analysis looked at the ratio of \"alumni and students who have identified themselves as founders and business owners on LinkedIn\" and the total number of alumni and students. LinkedIn particularized the *Forbes* rankings, placing Brown third (between MIT and Princeton) among \"Best Undergraduate Universities for Software Developers at Startups.\" LinkedIn's methodology involved a career-path examination of \"millions of alumni profiles\" in its membership database.[173]\n\n\nIn 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2021 the university produced the most Fulbright recipients of any university in the nation.[174][175][176] Brown has also produced the 7th most Rhodes Scholars of all colleges and universities in the United States.[177]\n\n\n\n## Research[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBrown is the largest institutional landowner in Providence, with properties on College Hill and in the Jewelry District.[55] The university was built contemporaneously with the eighteenth and nineteenth-century precincts surrounding it, making Brown's campus tightly integrated into Providence's urban fabric. Among the noted architects who have shaped Brown's campus are McKim, Mead & White, Philip Johnson, Rafael Vi\u00f1oly, Diller Scofidio + Renfro, and Robert A. M. Stern.[56]\n\n\n\n### Main campus[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2020, Brown announced it had sold 90 percent of its fossil fuel investments as part of a broader divestment from direct investments and managed funds that focus on fossil fuels.[81] In 2021, the university adopted the goal of reducing quantifiable campus emissions by 75 percent by 2025 and achieving carbon neutrality by 2040.[82] Brown is a member of the Ivy Plus Sustainability Consortium, through which it has committed to best-practice sharing and the ongoing exchange of campus sustainability solutions along with other member institutions. [83]\n\n\nAccording to the A. W. Kuchler U.S. potential natural vegetation types, Brown would have a dominant vegetation type of Appalachian Oak (*104*) with a dominant vegetation form of Eastern Hardwood Forest (*25*).[84]\n\n\n\n## Academics[edit]\n\n\n### The College[edit]\n\n\nMain article: College of Brown University\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Colors | Seal brown,\u00a0cardinal red,\u00a0and\u00a0white[5]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 |\n| Nickname | Bears |\n| Sporting affiliations\n | * NCAA Division I FCS \u2013 Ivy League\n* ECAC Hockey\n* EARC\n* EAWRC\n* NEISA\n* CWPA\n* IRA\n |\n| Mascot | Bruno the Bear |\n| Website | www.brown.edu |\n| ![](image) |\n\n\n**Brown University** is a private Ivy League research university in Providence, Rhode Island.

Established in 1769 by Eleazar Wheelock, it is one of the nine colonial colleges chartered before the American Revolution. Although originally established to educate Native Americans in Christian theology and the English way of life, the university primarily trained Congregationalist ministers during its early history before it gradually secularized. Emerging into national prominence at the turn of the 20th century, Dartmouth was considered to be the most prestigious undergraduate college in the United States in the early 1900s.[8][9] While Dartmouth is now a research university rather than simply an undergraduate college, it continues to go by \"Dartmouth College\" to emphasize its focus on undergraduate education.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1970, longtime professor of mathematics and computer science John George Kemeny became president of Dartmouth.[37] Kemeny oversaw several major changes at the college. Dartmouth, which had been a men's institution, began admitting women as full-time students and undergraduate degree candidates in 1972 amid much controversy.[38] At about the same time, the college adopted its \"Dartmouth Plan\" of academic scheduling, permitting the student body to increase in size within the existing facilities.[37] In 1988, Dartmouth's alma mater song's lyrics changed from \"Men of Dartmouth\" to \"Dear old Dartmouth\".[39]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n17. **^** \"Dartmouth alumni seek national, state political offices\". *The Dartmouth*.

As a result, classes and research were suspended until a tentative agreement was reached on April 15, 2023.[56][57] Five months later, in September, the university's faculty senate voted \"no confidence\" in Holloway; in addition to issues related to the strikes, the motion also cited Halloway's decision to dismiss the chancellor of the university's Newark campus and his proposal to merge the university's two medical schools.[58]\n\n\n\n## Organization and administration[edit]\n\n\n### University president[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Rutgers University presidents\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n64. **^** Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey.

The Board elects a Rector, Vice-Rector, and Secretary and the Board meets four times annually.[50] The Board is responsible for appointing a president, related administrative officers, and an honorary chancellor, approving degrees, admission policies, departments, and schools, and executing the fiduciary duties of supervising the college's property and finances.[51]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCollege of William & Mary| ![](image) |\n| Latin: *Collegium Gulielmi et Mariae* |\n| Type | Royal college (1693\u20131776)  Private college (1776\u20131906)  Public research university |\n| Established | February\u00a08, 1693; 331 years ago\u00a0(1693-02-08)[1][a] |\n| Accreditation | SACS |\n| Religious affiliation\n | Nonsectarian, formerly Church of England |\n| Academic affiliations\n | * ORAU\n* SCHEV\n* URA\n* Sea-grant\n* Space-grant\n |\n| Endowment | $1.3 billion (2021)[2] |\n| Chancellor | Robert Gates |\n| President | Katherine Rowe |\n| Rector | Charles Poston |\n| Academic staff\n | 738 full-time, 183 part-time[3] |\n| Students | 9,517 (Fall 2022)[4] |\n| Undergraduates | 6,543 (Fall 2022)[4] |\n| Postgraduates | 2,974 (Fall 2022)[4] |\n| Location | Williamsburg\n, Virginia\n, United States\n37\u00b016\u203215\u2033N 76\u00b042\u203230\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff37.27083\u00b0N 76.70833\u00b0W\ufeff / 37.27083; -76.70833 |\n| Campus | Small suburb, 1,200 acres (4.9\u00a0km2) |\n| Other campuses | * Gloucester Point\n* Newport News\n* Washington, D.C.\n |\n| Newspaper | *The Flat Hat* |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Chancellor of the College of William & Mary is largely a ceremonial role. Until 1776, the position was held by an English subject, usually the Archbishop of Canterbury or the Bishop of London, who served as the college's advocate to the Crown, while a colonial President oversaw the day-to-day activities of the Williamsburg campus. Following the Revolutionary War, General George Washington was appointed as the first American chancellor; later United States President John Tyler held the post. The college has recently had several distinguished chancellors: former Chief Justice of the United States Warren E. Burger (1986\u20131993), former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher (1993\u20132000), former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger (2000\u20132005), and former U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor (2005\u20132012).[52] Former U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates, himself an alumnus of the college, succeeded O'Connor in February 2012.[53]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPrince Charles would return to the college in 1993 for the 300th anniversary of William & Mary, and that same year William & Mary sent a delegation to meet with Queen Elizabeth II. Former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher would be made the Chancellor of the College of William & Mary that same year. In 2007, Elizabeth II and Prince Philip would visit the college for a second time to recognize the 400th anniversary of the landing at Jamestown.[39] In 2022, a beacon was lit in front of the Wren Building to celebrate the Platinum Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II.[40]\n\n\n\n## Campus[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Earl Gregg Swem Library on New Campus\nThe college is on a 1,200-acre (490\u00a0ha) campus in Williamsburg, Virginia.
