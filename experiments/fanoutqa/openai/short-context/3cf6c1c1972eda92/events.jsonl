You can help by adding missing items with reliable sources.\n\nThis page provides a **list of the largest deals for books and book series** to date. It differentiates from the list of best-selling books in that book deals are secured before the book is released, and often before the book is completed. The books are listed according to the highest book deal estimate as reported in reliable, independent sources.\n\n\nAmerican authors hold the record for the largest book deals made for individual books (Bill Clinton and Britney Spears), and for book series (James Patterson and Barack and Michelle Obama). While Patterson's book deal with Hachette Book Group is by far the largest for a book series, Patterson has disputed the reported amount.\n\n\nContrary to popular belief, J. K. Rowling's advances for the individual *Harry Potter* books or series overall do not appear on this list.

It topped *The New York Times* Best Seller list shortly after its release in 2016.[1]\n\n\nThe book addresses subjects such as gun violence in the United States, sexual assault and consent, domestic violence, as well as more personal issues such as her troubled relationship with her mother, and her father's multiple sclerosis.[2]\n\n\nThe book's title is a reference to *The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo*.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\nThe book received generally favorable reviews from critics. Isabella Biedenharn of *Entertainment Weekly* gave the book a B+, writing that the book was \"full of advice—and not just the tongue-in-cheek kind you might expect from a stand-up comedian\" and that it was \"much more like a straightforward memoir than even [Schumer] appears to believe\", summing up her review stating that the book was \"far less a portable joke factory than it is a real, deep dive into Schumer’s life.\"[2]\n\n\nHeidi Stevens of the *Chicago Tribune* wrote that when a celebrity \"offers a self-reveal\" it's \"an exercise in either vanity or courage\", but that Schumer's was \"mostly the latter\", and that \"even the parts that veer into the former are witty enough to make you glad you stuck around.\"[4] Lincee Ray of the Associated Press said that \"readers will laugh and cry, and may put the book down from moments of honesty that result in uncomfortable realistic details from her life.\"[5]\n\n\n\n## Awards[edit]\n\n\nIn 2016, the book won Best Humor, with 41,080 votes, at the Goodreads Choice Awards.[6]\n\n\nIn 2017, the audiobook, read by Amy, was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards.\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Raynor, Madeline. \"Amy Schumer: Girl with the Lower Back Tattoo tops the New York Times bestseller list\". *Entertainment Weekly*.

The book is a companion piece to *Chapter and Verse*, a career-spanning album featuring songs from all stages of Springsteen's career that was released four days before the book.[2][3] On the date of the book's release, Springsteen embarked on a nine-date book tour in the United States.[4] The book has received critical acclaim.[5]\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\nThe book's release was officially announced on August 25, 2016.\n\n\n\n## Book tour[edit]\n\n\nSpringsteen embarked on a nine-date book tour which started on September 27, 2016, and concluded on October 10, 2016. The book tour then made its way to the United Kingdom and Germany in late October for two appearances. On October 27, Springsteen hosted another book-signing event in Toronto, Canada, before interrupting the tour to take part in the annual *Stand Up For Heroes* concert, to appear in support of Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, and to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom. The tour resumed with a five-date North American leg, which was announced on November 21, 2016.[6] This tour began in Chicago on November 28, 2016, and concluded in Kennesaw, Georgia on December 2.\n\n\nAll events required fans to purchase a pre-signed copy of Springsteen's book. The free tickets for the book store appearances much like his shows were sold out in minutes. Two of the appearances, October 5 in San Francisco and October 7 in New York City featured interviews only with Springsteen and were conducted by Dan Stone and David Remnick. Springsteen also made appearances on *CBS Sunday Morning* on September 18, 2016, and on *Late Night with Stephen Colbert* on September 23, 2016 (Springsteen's 67th birthday), to promote the book.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Date\n | City\n | Country\n | Venue\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **North America** |\n| September 27, 2016 | Freehold | United States | Barnes & Noble |\n| September 28, 2016 | New York | Barnes & Noble Union Square\n |\n| September 29, 2016 | Philadelphia | Free Library of Philadelphia |\n| October 1, 2016 | Seattle | Elliott Bay Book Company\n |\n| October 3, 2016 | Los Angeles | Barnes & Noble at The Grove\n |\n| October 4, 2016 | Portland | Powell's City of Books |\n| October 5, 2016 | San Francisco | City Arts & Lectures |\n| October 7, 2016 | New York | The New Yorker Festival |\n| October 10, 2016 | Cambridge | The Harvard Coop\n |\n| **Europe** |\n| October 17, 2016 | London | United Kingdom | Waterstones Piccadilly |\n| October 20, 2016 | Frankfurt | Germany | Frankfurt Book Fair |\n| **North America** |\n| October 27, 2016 | Toronto | Canada | Indigo Books and Music |\n| November 28, 2016 | Chicago | United States | Books-A-Million |\n| November 29, 2016 | Cincinnati | Joseph-Beth Booksellers\n |\n| November 30, 2016 | Denver | Tattered Cover |\n| December 1, 2016 | Austin | Book People\n |\n| December 2, 2016 | Kennesaw | 2nd & Charles\n |\n\n\n## *Springsteen on Broadway*[edit]\n\n\nSpringsteen performed an eight-week run in New York City from October–November 2017 titled *Springsteen on Broadway* where he performed his music, read from *Born to Run*, and performed other spoken reminiscences written for the show. The run was extended through December 15, 2018.[7]\n\n\n\n## Awards[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2017, Springsteen was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album.[8] In 2018 *Born to Run* won Best Autobiography/Memoir at the 2018 Audie Awards.[9]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Born to Run Audio\".\n2. **^** \"Born To Run autobiography coming Sept. 27 - The Official Bruce Springsteen Website\". *Brucespringsteen.net*. 2016-08-25.

The book is a companion piece to *Chapter and Verse*, a career-spanning album featuring songs from all stages of Springsteen's career that was released four days before the book.[2][3] On the date of the book's release, Springsteen embarked on a nine-date book tour in the United States.[4] The book has received critical acclaim.[5]\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\nThe book's release was officially announced on August 25, 2016.\n\n\n\n## Book tour[edit]\n\n\nSpringsteen embarked on a nine-date book tour which started on September 27, 2016, and concluded on October 10, 2016. The book tour then made its way to the United Kingdom and Germany in late October for two appearances. On October 27, Springsteen hosted another book-signing event in Toronto, Canada, before interrupting the tour to take part in the annual *Stand Up For Heroes* concert, to appear in support of Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, and to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom. The tour resumed with a five-date North American leg, which was announced on November 21, 2016.[6] This tour began in Chicago on November 28, 2016, and concluded in Kennesaw, Georgia on December 2.\n\n\nAll events required fans to purchase a pre-signed copy of Springsteen's book. The free tickets for the book store appearances much like his shows were sold out in minutes.

But in between, it contains a clear and at times riveting account of Hillary Rodham Clinton's four years as secretary of state.\"[34] Robin Abcarian of the *Los Angeles Times* assessed it as \"a richly detailed and compelling chronicle of Clinton's role in the foreign initiatives and crises that defined the first term of the Obama administration ... told from the point of view of a policy wonk.\"[35]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn early July, Clinton went to Europe to stage promotional appearances for the book, visiting England, Germany, and France.[30] Book signings back in the U.S. continued for the rest of that month.[30] The length of the promotional tour recalled her heavy travel schedule as Secretary of State,[30] and largely put to rest questions about her health that had circulated among some since her concussion and blood clot treatment in late 2012.[31] While the appearances and the news coverage of some of her statements during the tour exposed some of Clinton's strengths and weaknesses as a public figure, they did not change Clinton's poll approval numbers.[31]\n\n\n\n## Critical and commercial reception[edit]\n\n\nInitial reviews for *Hard Choices* were generally mixed to favorable.[8][32][33]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBy the time of the book's publication, it was said to have already received one million pre-orders.[17] In actuality, Simon & Schuster said that it during its first week on sale, it sold over 100,000 copies,[38] a figure supported by extrapolation of the underlying Nielsen BookScan data.[39] It debuted at first on the *New York Times* Best Seller list for hardcover nonfiction.[38] During its second and third weeks of availability, sales of *Hard Choices* declined markedly, but were still enough to keep it atop the *Times* Best Sellers list.[40][41] In the fourth week, sales declined again and the book surrendered the top spot on the *Times* Best Sellers list to Edward Klein's *Blood Feud: The Clintons vs. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe book was promoted partly in light of the possibility of a Clinton bid in the 2016 presidential election (in which, two years after the release of the book, she would go on to win the Democratic nomination and then lose to Donald Trump in the general election). Excerpts from the book were released in advance of its publication. Clinton staged an extensive promotional tour for the book, which had the air of a political campaign with groups both for and against her appearing at book-signing events. *Hard Choices* reached #1 on the *New York Times* Best Seller List, but sold considerably less than her 2003 memoir, *Living History*. Interpreting what sales of the book meant for her possible political future became a subject for discussion among interested parties.\n\n\n\n\n## Conception and development[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe book continued to accumulate sales into the year following its publication. By March 2015, Nielsen BookScan had it selling 264,000 copies,[45] and figure that rose to 280,000 copies by July 2015[46] and 292,200 copies by March 2016.[47] By mid-2015, Clinton had earned more than $5 million in royalties from the book.[48] Compared to recent books published by the many 2016 Republican presidential candidates, her sales were well short of Ben Carson's *One Nation: What We Can All Do To Save America's Future*, but were well ahead of those of any of the others,[45][49] with only the combined sales of a pair of books by Donald Trump coming close.[47] By late November 2015, counting both print and e-books, *Time* magazine said *Hard Choices* had sold a little over 340,000 units.[50]\n\n\n\n## Foreign editions and translations[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nClinton also delves into some personal aspects of her life and career, including getting past any hard feelings towards Obama from her 2008 presidential campaign, events in her family including her daughter Chelsea Clinton's wedding, and glimpses of personal interaction with citizens of other countries during her travels as secretary.[13] The book also addresses the disappointment of her 2008 loss, and for the first time fully recants her 2002 vote on the Iraq War Resolution that cost her in that campaign, writing that \"I thought I had acted in good faith and made the best decision I could with the information I had. And I wasn't alone in getting it wrong. But I still got it wrong. Plain and simple.\"[12][16]\n\n\nThe book concludes with some general thoughts about her visions for America going forward,[12] but it shed no light on whether she would run for president in 2016, saying only, \"[t]he time for another hard choice will come soon.\"[13]\n\n\n\n## Promotional efforts[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Kim, Eun Kyung (January 29, 2013). \"Hillary Clinton to write second memoir\". *Today*.

Spears wrote that the reason for her 55-hour marriage to Jason Alexander was, that she was \"drunk and very bored.\" She wrote that her family got angry after finding out about her marriage. Spears wrote: \"They made way too big a deal out of innocent fun. Everybody has a different perspective on it, but I didn't take it that seriously. I thought a goof-around Vegas wedding was something people might do as a joke. Then my family came and acted like I'd started World War III. I cried the whole rest of the time I was in Las Vegas.\"[16]\n\n\nSpears discusses her relationship with Kevin Federline and the struggles she faced after becoming a mother, including suffering from postpartum depression.
