Most illegal immigrants come from Bolivia and Paraguay, countries which border Argentina to the north. Smaller numbers arrive from Peru and Ecuador.\nThe Argentine government estimates that 750,000 inhabitants lack official documents and has launched a program called *Patria Grande* (\"Greater Homeland\")[55] to encourage illegal immigrants to regularize their status; so far over 670,000 applications have been processed under the program.[56]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n64. **^** Marita Carballo. *Valores good food here al cambio del milenio* ISBN 950-794-064-2.

In addition, after centuries of net emigration, from the 1980s Italy has experienced large-scale immigration for the first time in modern history. Italian government data, in its annual report for 2019, estimated the amount of foreign nationals residing within Italy, including immigrants, to be at approximately 5.234 million people.[3] Due to such large-scale immigration to the country, particularly from the early 2000s to 2014, the population peaked at 60.79 million. Since then, decreasing migration, a continuously falling birth rate, and continuous aging have led to a sharp decrease in the Italian population.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Animated population pyramid 1982–2021.

According to the most recent data, Germany's population is 84,432,670 (31 March 2023)[1] making it the most populous country in the European Union and the nineteenth-most populous country in the world. The total fertility rate was rated at 1.58 in 2021,[6] significantly below the replacement rate of 2.1. For a long time Germany had one of the world's lowest fertility rates of around 1.3 to 1.4, however there has been a small increase in recent years.[7] Due to the low birth rate Germany has recorded more deaths than births every year since 1972,[8] which means 2021 was the 50th consecutive year the German population would have decreased without immigration. However, due to immigration the population has actually increased during the last half-century. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n*0–14 years:* 12.83% (male 5,299,798 /female 5,024,184)\n*15–24 years:* 9.98% (male 4,092,901 /female 3,933,997)\n*25–54 years:* 39.87% (male 16,181,931 /female 15,896,528)\n*55–64 years:* 14.96% (male 5,989,111 /female 6,047,449)\n*65 years and over:* 22.36% (male 7,930,590 /female 10,061,248) (2018 est.)\n**Median age**:\ntotal: 47.4 years.
