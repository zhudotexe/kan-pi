They have cycled through the fewest head coaches in the modern NFL history.[123] Their first coach was Forrest Douds, who coached them to a 3\u20136\u20132 record in 1933. Chuck Noll had the longest term as head coach with the Steelers; he is one of only four coaches to coach a single NFL team for 23 years.[5] Hired prior to the 2007 season, the Steelers current coach is Mike Tomlin.[124]\n\n\n\n### Current staff[edit]\n\n\n\n\n**Pittsburgh Steelers staff*** v\n* t\n* e\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn January 7, 2007, Cowher resigned from coaching the Steelers, citing a need to spend more time with his family. He did not use the term \"retire\", leaving open a possible return to the NFL as coach of another team. A three-man committee consisting of Art Rooney II, Dan Rooney, and Kevin Colbert was set up to conduct interviews for the head coaching vacancy.[20] On January 22, 2007, Minnesota Vikings defensive coordinator Mike Tomlin was announced as Cowher's successor as head coach. Tomlin is the first African-American to be named head coach of the team in its 75-year history. Tomlin became the third consecutive Steelers Head Coach to go to the Super Bowl, equaling the Dallas Cowboys (Tom Landry, Jimmy Johnson and Barry Switzer) in this achievement. He was named the Motorola 2008 Coach of the Year. On February 1, 2009, Tomlin led the Steelers to their second Super Bowl of this decade, and went on to win 27\u201323 against the Arizona Cardinals. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAt age 36, he was the youngest head coach to ever win the Super Bowl, and he is only the second African-American coach to ever win the Super Bowl (Tony Dungy was the first). The 2010 season made Tomlin the only coach to reach the Super Bowl twice before the age of 40 as he took the team to Super Bowl XLV on February 6, 2011. However, the Steelers were defeated by the Green Bay Packers, 31\u201325. The Steelers recorded their 400th victory in 2012 after defeating the Washington Redskins.[21]\n\n\nThrough the end of the 2021 season, Tomlin's record is 162\u201394\u20132 (.632), including playoffs. He is the first Pittsburgh coach to never post a losing season. The 2013\u201317 seasons were noted for record performances from the \"Killer B's\". This trio consisted of Antonio Brown, Ben Roethlisberger and Le'Veon Bell. Occasionally, the \"Killer B's\" has also included kicker Chris Boswell due to his ability to hit game-winning field goals.\n\n\n\n### Summary[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |\n|  | Front office* Owner/president \u2013 Art Rooney II\n* Vice president \u2013 Art Rooney Jr.\n* Vice president of player personnel \u2013 Dan Rooney Jr.\n* General manager \u2013 Omar Khan\n* Assistant general manager \u2013 Andy Weidl\n* Director of player scouting \u2013 Mark Sadowski\n* Director of college scouting \u2013 Dan Colbert\n* Director of pro scouting \u2013 Sheldon White\n* Senior scouting assistants \u2013 Phil Kreidler, Kelvin Fisher\n* Director of football administration \u2013 Cole Marcoux\n* Director of player development \u2013 Darrel Young\n\nHead coaches* Head coach \u2013 Mike Tomlin\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n### Offensive coordinator history[edit]\n\n\nSource:[125]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Years | Name\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 2021\u2013present | Matt Canada |\n| 2018\u20132020 | Randy Fichtner |\n| 2012\u20132017 | Todd Haley |\n| 2007\u20132011 | Bruce Arians |\n| 2004\u20132006 | Ken Whisenhunt |\n| 2001\u20132003 | Mike Mularkey |\n| 1999\u20132000 | Kevin Gilbride |\n| 1998 | Ray Sherman |\n| 1996\u20131997 | Chan Gailey |\n| 1992\u20131995 | Ron Erhardt |\n| 1990\u20131991 | Joe Walton |\n| 1983\u20131989 | Tom Moore |\n\n\n### Defensive coordinator history[edit]\n\n\nSource:[125]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Years | Name\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 2022\u2013present | Teryl Austin |\n| 2015\u20132021 | Keith Butler |\n| 2004\u201320141995\u20131996 | Dick LeBeau |\n| 2000\u20132003 | Tim Lewis |\n| 1997\u20131999 | Jim Haslett |\n| 1992\u20131994 | Dom Capers |\n| 1990\u20131991 | Dave Brazil |\n| 1989 | Rod Rust |\n| 1984\u20131988 | Tony Dungy |\n| 1979\u20131983 | Woody Widenhofer |\n| 1978 | George Perles |\n| 1973\u20131977 | Bud Carson |\n\n\n## Media[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Map of radio affiliates.\nFurther information: Pittsburgh Steelers Radio Network\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n124. **^** Dulac, Gerry (January 18, 2007). \"Tomlin, 34, is NFL's rising coaching star\". *Pittsburgh Post-Gazette*.

Pete Carroll, Parcells's successor, would also take the team to the playoffs twice in 1997 and 1998 before being dismissed as head coach after the 1999 season.[15]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| NFL Comeback Player of the Year |\n| --- |\n| Season\n | Player\n | Position\n |\n| 1966(AFL) | Vito \"Babe\" Parilli | QB |\n| 2005 | Tedy Bruschi | LB |\n| 2009 | Tom Brady | QB |\n| 2014 | Rob Gronkowski | TE |\n\n\n | \n\n| NFL Coach of the Year |\n| --- |\n| Season\n | Coach\n |\n| 1994 | **Bill Parcells** |\n| 2003 | Bill Belichick |\n| 2007 |\n| 2010 |\n\n\n | \n\n| NFL Executive of the Year\n |\n| --- |\n| Season\n | Executive\n |\n| 2003 | Scott Pioli |\n| 2007 |\n| 2021 | Bill Belichick |\n\n\n |\n\n## Players of note[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of New England Patriots players, List of New England Patriots starting quarterbacks, and List of New England Patriots first-round draft picks\n\n### Current roster[edit]\n\n\n\n\n**New England Patriots roster*** view\n* talk\n* edit\n\n| **Quarterbacks*** 14 Jacoby Brissett\n* 10 *Drake Maye*\n* 19 *Joe Milton*\n* 4 Bailey Zappe\n\n**Running backs**\n* 35 *Deshaun Fenwick*\n* 21 Antonio Gibson\n* 36 Kevin Harris\n* 39 JaMycal Hasty\n* 29 *Terrell Jennings*\n* 38 Rhamondre Stevenson\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe **New England Patriots** are a professional American football team based in the Greater Boston area.

Nolan was the son of Dick Nolan, who had led the team to three consecutive playoff appearances from 1970 to 1972. The 49ers did not hire a general manager. In Mike Nolan's first draft as head coach, he selected quarterback Alex Smith from the University of Utah with the first overall pick of the 2005 NFL Draft. It was a pick predicted by most, though many thought the 49ers might select local product Aaron Rodgers of the University of California. Alex Smith's rookie season was a disaster, producing only one touchdown against eleven interceptions. The team finished 4th in the NFC West for the second consecutive year, with a 4\u201312 record. This earned the 49ers the 6th pick in the 2006 NFL Draft which they used to draft tight end Vernon Davis. Alex Smith and the team improved greatly in 2006, led by second-year player Frank Gore from the University of Miami. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Walsh, Bill**Bill Walsh** | 1993 | Head coach | 1979\u20131988 (Head)1999\u20132001 (VP and GM)2002\u20132004 (Consultant)\n |\n| Gil Brandt | 2019 | Executive | 1958\u20131959\n |\n\n\n### Retired numbers[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of San Francisco 49ers retired numbers\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n#### Kyle Shanahan years (2017\u2013present)[edit]\n\n\nAfter hiring John Lynch as general manager and Kyle Shanahan as head coach, the 49ers started the 2017 season with nine consecutive losses. During this time, they traded for New England Patriots backup quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo.[100] After a win over the New York Giants and a loss to the Seattle Seahawks, Garoppolo was named the starter after rookie C.

After the season, the 49ers signed Garoppolo to a five-year, $137.5 million contract extension. This made him the highest-paid player in NFL history on a per-year basis at the time.[102] During the third-week matchup between the 49ers and Kansas City Chiefs, Jimmy Garoppolo tore his ACL, and was ruled out for the rest of the 2018 season.[103]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nSan Francisco 49ers\n |\n| --- |\n| * Founded in 1946\n* Based and headquartered in **Santa Clara, California**\n |\n| Franchise | * Franchise\n* Team history\n* Coaches\n* Players\n* Seasons\n* Logo and uniform history\n* Starting quarterbacks\n* Draft history (First-round draft picks)\n* Broadcasters\n* Retired numbers\n |\n| Stadiums | * Kezar Stadium\n* Candlestick Park\n* **Levi's Stadium**\n* State Farm Stadium\n\t+ Three games played due to the COVID-19 pandemic\n |\n| Culture | * 49er Faithful\n* Sourdough Sam\n* San Francisco 49ers Gold Rush\n* West Coast offense\n* The Pigskin Priest\n* KGO\n* KNBR\n |\n| Lore | * The Catch (II)\n* Joe Cool\n* Million Dollar Backfield\n* Snowball Game\n* No Punt Game\n* F\u00fatbol Americano\n* Harbaugh Bowl\n* The Tip\n* Jet Chip Wasp\n |\n| Rivalries | * Arizona Cardinals\n* Dallas Cowboys\n* Green Bay Packers\n* Oakland Raiders (former)\n* Los Angeles Rams\n* New York Giants\n* Seattle Seahawks\n |\n| Key figures | * Eddie DeBartolo\n* Denise DeBartolo York\n* Jed York\n* John York\n* Gideon Yu\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n46. **^** \"49ers fire Mariucci over clash of big egos\". *Deseret News*.

The season also featured second-year running back Ezekiel Elliott being suspended for 6 games after violating the league's conduct policy. The suspension was to begin at the start of the year but was pushed back to November. The Cowboys finished the year at 9-7 without making the playoffs. Following the season, Dez Bryant was released after eight seasons in Dallas and tight end Jason Witten, who holds several franchise receiving records, retired after 15 seasons, ending an era.[67][68]\n\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys' 2017 season was the subject of the third season of Amazon's sports documentary series *All or Nothing*.

Harlan preferred the structure Green Bay had employed since 1991; a general manager who ran football operations and hired a subservient head coach. But with the momentum and locker room chemistry that was built during the 2000 season, Harlan was reluctant to bring in a new individual with a potentially different philosophy. Wolf recommended that Harlan give the job to Sherman. Though Harlan was wary of the structure in principle, he agreed with Wolf that it was the best solution. In 2001, Sherman assumed the duties of both general manager and head coach.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n91. **^** \"Packers fire coach Mike McCarthy after 13 seasons\". National Football League.

Ray Rhodes was hired in 1999 as the team's new head coach. Rhodes had served around the league as a highly regarded defensive coordinator and more recently experienced moderate success as head coach of the Philadelphia Eagles from 1995 to 1998. Ron Wolf believed that Rhodes' experience and player-friendly demeanor would fit nicely in Green Bay's veteran locker room, but Rhodes was fired after one 8\u20138 season. Wolf visited team practice late in the 1999 season and believed that players had become too comfortable with Rhodes' style, and said the atmosphere resembled a country club.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe **Green Bay Packers** are a professional American football team based in Green Bay, Wisconsin.

After defeating the Washington Redskins in Week 14, the Giants became the first team in NFL history to win 100 regular season games against an opponent.[71] However, this ensured last place in the NFC East for the second straight year, marking the first time they were division rock bottom in back-to-back years since 1977 and 1978. The season was also highlighted by blown fourth-quarter leads which was similar to their 2015 team, where the Giants were in 12 one-possession games, and lost 8 of those by 7 points or less.

Handley served as coach for two disappointing seasons (1991 and 1992), which saw the Giants fall from Super Bowl champions to an 8\u20138 record in 1991 and a 6\u201310 record in 1992. He was fired following the 1992 season, and replaced by former Denver Broncos' coach Dan Reeves. In the early 1990s, Simms and Taylor, two of the stars of the 1980s, played out the last seasons of their careers with steadily declining production. The Giants experienced a resurgent season with Reeves at the helm in 1993 however, and Simms and Taylor ended their careers as members of a playoff team.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe season was also highlighted the controversial benching of longtime quarterback Eli Manning in Week 13, and the high-profile firings of head coach Ben McAdoo and general manager Jerry Reese, who were the first mid-season staff firings since the 1976 Giants' season. Manning was eventually renamed the starter in Week 14. Subsequently, the disastrous season led to the team being awarded the second overall pick in the 2018 NFL Draft, which they utilized to select Saquon Barkley from Penn State. Despite Barkley's selection, several questions pertained into the following season around the team's offensive line and long-term future at quarterback.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1997, the Giants named Jim Fassel, who had spent the previous season as offensive coordinator of the Arizona Cardinals, as their 16th head coach. Fassel named Danny Kanell the team's starting quarterback. The Giants finished the 1997 season with a record of 10\u20135\u20131 and qualified for the playoffs for the first time in four years.[11] However, they lost in the wild-card round to the Vikings at home. The following year, the Giants began the season 4\u20138 before rallying to finish the season 8\u20138. One of the notable games of that season was a win over the eventual Super Bowl champion Denver Broncos in week 15, giving the Broncos their first loss of the season after starting 13\u20130.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n94. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Associated Press.
