Listed by the GaWC as an alpha global city, S\u00e3o Paulo is the most populous city outside of Asia and the world's 4th largest city proper by population. Additionally, S\u00e3o Paulo is the largest Portuguese-speaking city in the world. It exerts strong international influences in commerce, finance, arts and entertainment.[8] The city's name honors the Apostle, Saint Paul of Tarsus. The city's metropolitan area, the Greater S\u00e3o Paulo, ranks as the most populous in Brazil and the 12th most populous on Earth. The process of conurbation between the metropolitan areas around the Greater S\u00e3o Paulo (Campinas, Santos, Jundia\u00ed, Sorocaba and S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 dos Campos) created the S\u00e3o Paulo Macrometropolis,[9] a megalopolis with more than 30 million inhabitants, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe per capita income for the city was R$32,493 in 2008.[151] According to Mercer's 2011 city rankings of cost of living for expatriate employees, S\u00e3o Paulo is now among the ten most expensive cities in the world, ranking 10th in 2011, up from 21st in 2010 and ahead of London, Paris, Milan and New York City.[152][153]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBecause S\u00e3o Paulo has urban sprawl, it uses a different definition for its metropolitan area alternately called the Expanded Metropolitan Complex of S\u00e3o Paulo and the S\u00e3o Paulo Macrometropolis. Analogous to the BosWash definition, it is one of the largest urban agglomerations in the world, with 32 million inhabitants,[109] behind Tokyo, which includes four contiguous legally defined metropolitan regions and three micro-regions.\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\n| Religion in S\u00e3o Paulo (2010 Census)[110] |\n| --- |\n| Religion |  | Percent |\n| Roman Catholicism |  | 58.2% |\n| Protestantism |  | 22.1% |\n| No religion |  | 9.38% |\n| Spiritism |  | 4.73% |\n| Others |  | 4.25% |\n| Other Christians |  | 1.33% |\n\nSee also: Religion in Brazil, Protestantism in Brazil, and Roman Catholic Church in Brazil\n\n![](image)\nS\u00e3o Paulo Metropolitan Cathedral\n![](image)\nOrthodox Cathedral of S\u00e3o Paulo\n![](image)\nTemple of Solomon of the UCKG\n![](image)\nBuddhist Lohan Temple, Liberdade\n![](image)\nBr\u00e1s mosque\n![](image)\nBeth El Synagogue\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMost populous city in Brazil\n\nThis article is about the city.

The city has 1,500 bank branches and 70 shopping malls.[144]\n\n\nAs of 2014[update], S\u00e3o Paulo is the third largest exporting municipality in Brazil after Parauapebas, PA and Rio de Janeiro, RJ. In that year S\u00e3o Paulo's exported goods totaled $7.32B (USD) or 3.02% of Brazil's total exports. The top five commodities exported by S\u00e3o Paulo are soybean (21%), raw sugar (19%), coffee (6.5%), sulfate chemical wood pulp (5.6%), and corn (4.4%).[145]\n\n\nThe S\u00e3o Paulo Stock Exchange (BM&F Bovespa) is Brazil's official stock and bond exchange. It is the largest stock exchange in Latin America, trading about R$6\u00a0billion (US$3.5\u00a0billion) every day.[146]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Oct\u00e1vio Frias de Oliveira Bridge aside of *Centro Empresarial Na\u00e7\u00f5es Unidas*\nSince the beginning of the 20th century, S\u00e3o Paulo has been one of the main economic centers of Latin America. With the First and Second World Wars and the Great Depression, coffee exports to the United States and Europe were heavily affected, forcing the rich coffee growers to invest in the industrial activities that would make S\u00e3o Paulo the largest industrial center in Brazil. The new job vacancies contributed to attract a significant number of immigrants (mainly from Italy)[171] and migrants, especially from the Northeastern states.[172] From a population of only 32.000 people in 1880, S\u00e3o Paulo now had 8.5 million inhabitants in 1980. The rapid population growth has brought many problems for the city.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n137. **^** \"Oscar Freire Street\" (in Portuguese). Gohouse.com.br. 30 November 2010.

Because of its location on Brazil's northeastern coast, the city served as an important link in the Portuguese empire throughout the colonial era, maintaining close commercial ties with Portugal and Portuguese colonies in Africa and Asia.[60]\n\n\nSalvador remained the preeminent city in Brazil until 1763 when it was replaced as the national capital by Rio de Janeiro. In the last ten years many high-rise office and apartment buildings were constructed, sharing the same blocks with colonial-era housing or commercial buildings.[61]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Salvador** (English: *Savior*)[n 1] is a Brazilian municipality and capital city of the state of Bahia. Situated in the Zona da Mata in the Northeast Region of Brazil, Salvador is recognized throughout the country and internationally for its cuisine, music, and architecture. The African influence in many cultural aspects of the city makes it a center of Afro-Brazilian culture. As the first capital of Colonial Brazil, the city is one of the oldest in the Americas and one of the first planned cities in the world, having been established during the Renaissance period. Its foundation in 1549 by Tom\u00e9 de Sousa took place on account of the implementation of the General Government of Brazil by the Portuguese Empire.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSalvador lies on a small, roughly triangular peninsula that separates the Bay of All Saints, the largest bay in Brazil, from the Atlantic Ocean.[7] It was first reached by Gaspar de Lemos in 1501, just one year after Cabral's purported discovery of Brazil.[8] During his second voyage for Portugal, the Italian explorer Amerigo Vespucci sighted the bay on All Saints' Day (1 November) 1502 and, in honor of the date and his parish church in Florence, he named it the Bay of the Saint Savior of All the Saints.[9] The first European to settle nearby was Diogo \u00c1lvares Correia (\"Caramuru\"),[10] who was shipwrecked off the end of the peninsula in 1509. He lived among the Tupinamb\u00e1, marrying Guaibimpara and others. In 1531, Martim Afonso de Sousa led an expedition from Mount St Paul (**Morro de S\u00e3o Paulo**)[11] and, in 1534, Francisco Pereira Coutinho, the first captain of Bahia, established the settlement of Pereira in modern Salvador's Ladeira da Barra neighborhood. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Salvador\n |\n| --- |\n| Municipality\n |\n| Municipality of Salvador\n*Munic\u00edpio de Salvador* |\n| ![](image)\nSkyline of Salvador from Barra\n![](image)\nBarra Lighthouse\n![](image)\nPelourinho\n![](image)\nMonument to the Second of July\n![](image)\nHistoric Center\n![](image)\nLacerda Elevator\n![](image)\nPanoramic view of the Vit\u00f3ria neighborhood\n |\n| \n![Flag of Salvador](image)Flag\n![Official seal of Salvador](image)Seal\n |\n| Nickname(s):\u00a0*Roma Negra* (Black Rome) and *Soter\u00f3polis*\n |\n| Motto(s):\u00a0*Sic illa ad arcam reversa est* (Latin)\"So she returned to the ark\"\n |\n| ![Location of Salvador in the State of Bahia](image)Location of Salvador in the State of Bahia\n |\n| ![Salvador is located in Brazil](image)![Salvador](image)\nSalvador\nLocation in Brazil\nShow map of Brazil\n![Salvador is located in South America](image)![Salvador](image)\nSalvador\nSalvador (South America)\nShow map of South America\n |\n| Coordinates: 12\u00b058\u203229\u2033S 38\u00b028\u203236\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff12.97472\u00b0S 38.47667\u00b0W\ufeff / -12.97472; -38.47667 |\n| Country | ![](image)\u00a0Brazil |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n54. **^** Magalh\u00e3es da Silva T, Sandhya Rani MR, Nunes de Oliveira Costa G, Figueiredo MA, Melo PS, Nascimento JF, Molyneaux ND, Barreto ML, Reis MG, Teixeira MG, Blanton RE (2015). \"The correlation between ancestry and color in two cities of Northeast Brazil with contrasting ethnic compositions\". *European Journal of Human Genetics*. **23** (7): 984\u2013989. doi:10.1038/ejhg.2014.215.

Temperatures are relatively consistent, showing little variance throughout the course of the year.[38] Salvador's driest months of the year are December and January, when the city receives on average less than 10\u00a0cm (4\u00a0in) of precipitation. Salvador's wettest months are April, May and June, when at least 20\u00a0cm (8\u00a0in) of rain falls during each of these three months.[39]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Mannerist Cathedral Basilica of Salvador, the Primate of Brazil (1657\u20131746[50])According to an autosomal DNA study from 2008, the ancestral heritage of the population of Salvador was estimated to be 49.2% African, 36.3% European and 14.5% Native American.[51] The study also analyzed the genetic backgrounds of people by type of surname. Those with surnames with a religious connotation were 53.1% African in genetic ancestry and tended to be in lower economic classes. During the colonial era, it was typical practice for Portuguese priests and missionaries to baptize converted African slaves and Native Americans with surnames of religious connotations. These have been passed down to their descendants.\n\n\nA 2015 autosomal DNA study found out the following ancestral composition in Salvador: 50.5% of African ancestry, 42.4% of European ancestry and 5.8% of Native American ancestry.[52] The researchers explained they oversampled individuals living in poor environments (page 4).[52]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* *Pelourinho of Salvador, Bahia, Digital Media Archive*, archived from the original on 18 November 2011, retrieved 10 October 2011, creative commons-licensed images and data from a Federal University of Bahia/University of Ferrara/Leica Geosystems/CyArk research partnership\n* Explore the Historic Centre of Salvador de Bahia in the UNESCO collection on Google Arts and Culture\n* *The City of Salvador*, 1671, a map by Arnoldus Montanus (in English and Latin)\n* ![](image) Geographic data related to Salvador, Bahia at OpenStreetMap ![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\n\n\n| ![](image)\u00a0Geographic locale\n |\n| --- |\n| **Lat. and Long. 12\u00b058\u203229.03\u2033S 38\u00b028\u203236.60\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff12.9747306\u00b0S 38.4768333\u00b0W\ufeff / -12.9747306; -38.4768333**\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n114. **^** \"Salvador Public Transportation Statistics\".

By 2010 the population of the Federal District had surpassed 2,5\u00a0million. The city of Brasilia proper, the plano piloto was planned for about 500,000 inhabitants, a figure the plano piloto never surpassed, with a current population of only 214,529,[42] but its metropolitan area within the Federal District has grown past this figure.[43]\n\n\nFrom the beginning, the growth of Brasilia was greater than original estimates. According to the original plans, Brasilia would be a city for government authorities and staff. However, during its construction, Brazilians from all over the country migrated to the satellite cities of Brasilia, seeking public and private employment.[44]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Bras\u00edlia** (/br\u0259\u02c8z\u026ali\u0259/;[4][5] Portuguese: [b\u027ea\u02c8zilj\u0250]) is the federal capital of Brazil and seat of government of the Federal District. The city is located high in the Brazilian highlands in the country's Central-West region. It was founded by President Juscelino Kubitschek on 21 April 1960, to serve as the new national capital.
