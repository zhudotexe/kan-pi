By defeating Gonzaga in the championship game, the Baylor Bears became the second consecutive first-time NCAA champions, following the Virginia Cavaliers in 2019. The last time this happened was in 2002 and 2003, when the Maryland Terrapins and Syracuse Orange (then nicknamed Orangemen) won their first titles in their respective years. Baylor also joined Texas Western (now known as the University of Texas at El Paso) as the only two teams from the state of Texas to have won an NCAA Division I Basketball championship, the Miners having done so in 1966.\n\n\n\n\n## Tournament procedure[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament \u00a7\u00a0Current tournament format\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe **2021 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament** was a single-elimination tournament of 68 teams to determine the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I men's college basketball national champion for the 2020\u201321 season. The 82nd edition of the tournament began play on March 18, 2021 in sites around the state of Indiana,[1] and concluded with the championship game at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis on April 5, with the Baylor Bears defeating the previously undefeated Gonzaga Bulldogs 86\u201370 to earn the team's first ever title.\n\n\nFor logistical considerations surrounding the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic (which resulted in the cancellation of the previous year's tournament), the NCAA announced in January 2021 that all tournament games would be held in Indiana rather than at sites across the country. This was the only time in the history of the tournament that a single state has hosted it in its entirety.[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* March 25 and 27\n\t+ **Midwest Regional**, Target Center, Minneapolis, Minnesota (Host: University of Minnesota, Twin Cities)\n\t+ **West Regional**, Ball Arena, Denver, Colorado (Host: Mountain West Conference)\n* March 26 and 28\n\t+ **South Regional**, FedExForum, Memphis, Tennessee (Host: University of Memphis)\n\t+ **East Regional**, Barclays Center, Brooklyn, New York (Host: Atlantic 10 Conference)\n\n\n**National Semifinals and Championship** (Final Four and Championship)\n\n\n\n* April 3 and 5\n\t+ Lucas Oil Stadium, Indianapolis, Indiana (Hosts: IUPUI/Horizon League)\n\n\n## Qualification and selection[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: 2021 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament qualifying teams\n\n### Automatic qualifiers[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"NCAA announces early-round dates for tourney\". *ESPN.com*.

During this period, the tournament was divided into the East and West Regions. From 1952 to 1955, the Regional Championships were held at four sites, with two designated for the East and two for the West. In 1956, the four regions were given unique names for the first time. \n\n\nFrom 1946 to 1981, a consolation game was conducted before the Championship for the losing teams of the National Semifinals; the winning team was awarded third place and the losing team was awarded fourth place. In 1982, the NCAA eliminated the game and the two losing teams of the semifinal games are considered tied for third place in the official record book.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| **2021** | **Baylor** | **Big 12** | **South** | 1\n | **Scott Drew** | **Champion** | **Jared Butler** |\n| Gonzaga | West Coast\n | West\n | 1\n | Mark Few\n | Runner-up\n |  |\n| Houston | American\n | Midwest\n | 2\n | Kelvin Sampson\n |  |  |\n| UCLA | Pac-12[a] | East\n | 11\n | Mick Cronin\n |  |  |\n| **2022** | **Kansas** | **Big 12** | **Midwest** | 1\n | **Bill Self** | **Champion** | **Ochai Agbaji** |\n| North Carolina | Atlantic Coast\n | East\n | 8\n | Hubert Davis\n | Runner-up\n |  |\n| Duke | Atlantic Coast\n | West\n | 2\n | Mike Krzyzewski\n |  |  |\n| Villanova | Big East\n | South\n | 2\n | Jay Wright\n |  |  |\n| **2023** | **UConn** | **Big East** | **West** | 4\n | **Dan Hurley** | **Champion** | **Adama Sanogo** |\n| San Diego State | Mountain West\n | South\n | 5\n | Brian Dutcher\n | Runner-up\n |  |\n| Miami | Atlantic Coast\n | Midwest\n | 5\n | Jim Larra\u00f1aga\n |  |  |\n| Florida Atlantic | Conference USA\n | East\n | 9\n | Dusty May\n |  |  |\n\n\n## Final Four appearances by school[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Final Four\n | State\n | Teams\n | Game Played\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1954 | Pennsylvania\n | La Salle\u2020 | Penn State\u00a7 | National Semifinal\n |\n| 1960 | Ohio\n | Cincinnati\u00a7 | Ohio State\u2020 |  |\n| 1961 | Ohio\n | Cincinnati\u2020 | Ohio State\u2021 | National Championship\n |\n| 1962 | Ohio\n | Cincinnati\u2020 | Ohio State\u2021 | National Championship\n |\n| 1975 | Kentucky\n | Kentucky\u2020 | Louisville\u00a7 |  |\n| 1977 | North Carolina\n | Charlotte | North Carolina\u2021 |  |\n| 1991 | North Carolina\n | Duke\u2020 | North Carolina |  |\n| 2012 | Kentucky\n | Kentucky\u2020 | Louisville (vac.)\n | National Semifinal\n |\n| 2021 | Texas\n | Baylor\u2020 | Houston | National Semifinal\n |\n| 2022 | North Carolina\n | Duke | North Carolina\u2021 | National Semifinal\n |\n| 2023 | Florida\n | Florida Atlantic | Miami |  |\n\n\n\u2020 National Champion; \u2021 Runner-Up; \u00a7 Third Place\n\n\n\n## Vacated appearances[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nNCAA Division I men's basketball tournament\n |\n| --- |\n| Tournaments | * 1939\n* 1940\n* 1941\n* 1942\n* 1943\n* 1944\n* 1945\n* 1946\n* 1947\n* 1948\n* 1949\n* 1950\n* 1951\n* 1952\n* 1953\n* 1954\n* 1955\n* 1956\n* 1957\n* 1958\n* 1959\n* 1960\n* 1961\n* 1962\n* 1963\n* 1964\n* 1965\n* 1966\n* 1967\n* 1968\n* 1969\n* 1970\n* 1971\n* 1972\n* 1973\n* 1974\n* 1975\n* 1976\n* 1977\n* 1978\n* 1979\n* 1980\n* 1981\n* 1982\n* 1983\n* 1984\n* 1985\n* 1986\n* 1987\n* 1988\n* 1989\n* 1990\n* 1991\n* 1992\n* 1993\n* 1994\n* 1995\n* 1996\n* 1997\n* 1998\n* 1999\n* 2000\n* 2001\n* 2002\n* 2003\n* 2004\n* 2005\n* 2006\n* 2007\n* 2008\n* 2009\n* 2010\n* 2011\n* 2012\n* 2013\n* 2014\n* 2015\n* 2016\n* 2017\n* 2018\n* 2019\n* 2020\n* 2021\n* 2022\n* 2023\n* 2024\n* *2025*\n |\n| Structure | * Selection process\n* Venues\n* No. 1 seeds\n* First Four\n* Elite Eight\n* Final four\n |\n| Champions & awards | * List of champions\n* Most Outstanding Player\n |\n| Media & culture | * Blue bloods\n* Bracketology\n* Broadcasting\n\t+ Tournament\n\t+ Final Four\n* Cutting down the nets\n* March Madness pools\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n|  | Final Fours\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Atlantic Coast\n | 1981\u2020\u00a7, 1990\u00a7, 1991\u2021, 2001\u2020\u00a7, 2004, 2016\u2021\u00a7, 2022\u00a7 |\n| Big 12\n | 2003\u2021 |\n| Big East\n | 1985\u2020\u2021\u00a7 (3 teams), 1987\u00a7, 2009, 2013\u2020 (vac.)\n |\n| Big Eight\n | 1988\u2020\u2021 |\n| Big Ten\n | 1976\u2020\u2021, 1980, 1989\u00a7, 1992, 1999 (vac.), 2000\u00a7, 2005, 2015\n |\n| Southeastern\n | 1994\u2020, 1996\u2020, 2006\u2020, 2014\n |\n\n\n\u2020National Champion; \u2021Runner Up; \u00a7Teams played in National Semifinals\n\n\n\u2020\u2021Teams played in National Championship game\n\n\n\n## Final Four appearances by state[edit]\n\n\nSchools from 38 states, including the District of Columbia, have appeared in the Final Four.

The remaining 36 bids were issued \"at-large\", with selections extended by the NCAA Selection Committee on Selection Sunday, March 12.[13] The Selection Committee also seeded the entire field from 1 to 68.\n\n\nEight teams (the four-lowest seeded automatic qualifiers and the four lowest-seeded at-large teams) played in the First Four. The winners of those games advanced to the main tournament bracket.\n\n\n\n## Schedule and venues[edit]\n\n\nThe following are the sites selected to host the each round of the 2023 tournament:[14]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe **2023 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament** involved 68 teams playing in a single-elimination tournament that determined the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I men's basketball national champion for the 2022\u201323 season. The 84th annual edition of the tournament began on March 14, 2023, and concluded with the UConn Huskies defeating the San Diego State Aztecs, 76\u201359 in the championship game on April 3 at NRG Stadium in Houston, Texas.[1]\n\n\nASUN champion Kennesaw State made its NCAA tournament debut, while Southern Conference champion Furman made its first NCAA appearance since 1980. Another school, Texas Southern, won the SWAC tournament to tie the Coppin State Eagles in 2008 and Liberty Flames in 2013 for most losses ever to make the tournament, with 20.[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWith FAU (Conference USA) and SDSU (Mountain West Conference), the Final Four had two mid-major teams for the first time since 2011's Butler and VCU. \n\n\nThe 2023 Final Four was also marked by its lack of highly touted high school prospects. For the first time since the NCAA began seeding the tournament in 1979, no former McDonald's All-American participated in the Final Four. Of the rotation players on the Final Four teams (those receiving regular playing time), the highest-ranked in the composite recruiting rankings of 247Sports was UConn's Jordan Hawkins, who was #51 in the 2021 class. Only eight rotation players in the Final Four were even ranked in the top 100; by contrast, 12 players were unranked in high school. Two teams, Florida Atlantic and San Diego State, had no top-100 players, with FAU's nine-man rotation featuring six unranked players and only one in the top 200.[12]\n\n\n\n\n## Procedures[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament \u00a7\u00a0Tournament format\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![2023 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament is located in the United States](image)![Dayton](image)\nDayton\n![Orlando](image)\nOrlando\n![Birmingham](image)\nBirmingham\n![Des Moines](image)\nDes Moines\n![Sacramento](image)\nSacramento\n![Albany](image)\nAlbany\n![Greensboro](image)\nGreensboro\n![Columbus](image)\nColumbus\n![Denver](image)\nDenver\nclass=notpageimage|\n2023 First Four (orange) and first and second rounds (green)\n\n![2023 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament is located in the United States](image)![New York](image)\nNew York\n![Las Vegas](image)\nLas Vegas\n![Louisville](image)\nLouisville\n![Kansas City](image)\nKansas City\n![Houston](image)\nHouston\nclass=notpageimage|\n2023 Regionals (blue) and **Final Four** (red)\n\n**First Four**\n\n\n\n* March 14 and 15\n\t+ University of Dayton Arena, Dayton, Ohio (Host: University of Dayton)\n\n\n**First and second rounds** (subregionals)\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nEdition of USA college basketball tournament\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2023 NCAA Division I  \nmen's basketball tournament| ![](image) |\n| Season | 2022\u201323 |\n| Teams | 68 |\n| Finals site | NRG StadiumHouston, Texas |\n| Champions | UConn Huskies (5th title, 5th title game,6th Final Four) |\n| Runner-up | San Diego State Aztecs (1st title game,1st Final Four) |\n| Semifinalists | * Florida Atlantic Owls (1st Final Four)\n* Miami Hurricanes (1st Final Four)\n |\n| Winning coach | Dan Hurley (1st title) |\n| MOP | Adama Sanogo (UConn) |\n| \n\n| NCAA Division I men's tournaments |\n| --- |\n| \u00ab2022 | 2024\u00bb |\n\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Duarte, Joseph (July 16, 2018). \"Houston To Host Final Four in 2023\". *Chron.com*.

During this period, the tournament was divided into the East and West Regions. From 1952 to 1955, the Regional Championships were held at four sites, with two designated for the East and two for the West. In 1956, the four regions were given unique names for the first time. \n\n\nFrom 1946 to 1981, a consolation game was conducted before the Championship for the losing teams of the National Semifinals; the winning team was awarded third place and the losing team was awarded fourth place. In 1982, the NCAA eliminated the game and the two losing teams of the semifinal games are considered tied for third place in the official record book.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| **2021** | **Baylor** | **Big 12** | **South** | 1\n | **Scott Drew** | **Champion** | **Jared Butler** |\n| Gonzaga | West Coast\n | West\n | 1\n | Mark Few\n | Runner-up\n |  |\n| Houston | American\n | Midwest\n | 2\n | Kelvin Sampson\n |  |  |\n| UCLA | Pac-12[a] | East\n | 11\n | Mick Cronin\n |  |  |\n| **2022** | **Kansas** | **Big 12** | **Midwest** | 1\n | **Bill Self** | **Champion** | **Ochai Agbaji** |\n| North Carolina | Atlantic Coast\n | East\n | 8\n | Hubert Davis\n | Runner-up\n |  |\n| Duke | Atlantic Coast\n | West\n | 2\n | Mike Krzyzewski\n |  |  |\n| Villanova | Big East\n | South\n | 2\n | Jay Wright\n |  |  |\n| **2023** | **UConn** | **Big East** | **West** | 4\n | **Dan Hurley** | **Champion** | **Adama Sanogo** |\n| San Diego State | Mountain West\n | South\n | 5\n | Brian Dutcher\n | Runner-up\n |  |\n| Miami | Atlantic Coast\n | Midwest\n | 5\n | Jim Larra\u00f1aga\n |  |  |\n| Florida Atlantic | Conference USA\n | East\n | 9\n | Dusty May\n |  |  |\n\n\n## Final Four appearances by school[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**General**\n\n\n*Men's Final Four 2023 Records Book*(PDF).

A mass meeting of the student body was called, and a star player showed up wearing a navy blue and orange scarf he had brought back from a University of Oxford summer rowing expedition. The colors were chosen when another student pulled the scarf from the player's neck, waved it to the crowd and yelled: \"How will this do?\" (Exactly 100 years later in 1988, Oxford named their own American football club the \"Cavaliers,\" and soon after the Virginia team adopted its \"curved sabres\" logo in 1994, the Oxford team followed suit.)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nSports teams based in Virginia\n |\n| --- |\n| Baseball | IL\nNorfolk Tides\nEL\nRichmond Flying Squirrels\nCL\nFredericksburg Nationals\nLynchburg Hillcats\nSalem Red Sox\nApL\nDanville Otterbots\nPulaski River Turtles\nCPL\nMartinsville Mustangs\nPeninsula Pilots\nTri-City Chili Peppers\nVBL\nCharlottesville Tom Sox\nCovington Lumberjacks\nFront Royal Cardinals\nHarrisonburg Turks\nNew Market Rebels\nPurcellville Cannons\nStaunton Braves\nStrasburg Express\nWaynesboro Generals\nWinchester Royals\nWoodstock River Bandits\n | ![](image)\n |\n| Basketball | ABA\nRichmond Elite\n |\n| Football | WFA\nRichmond Black Widows\n |\n| Ice hockey | ECHL\nNorfolk Admirals\nSPHL\nRoanoke Rail Yard Dawgs\nFPHL\nBlue Ridge Bobcats\n |\n| Roller derby | WFTDA\nCharlottesville Derby Dames\nDominion Derby Girls\nNRV Rollergirls\nRiver City Rollergirls\nRocktown Rollers\nStar City Roller Girls\n |\n| Rugby league | USARL\nNorthern Virginia Eagles\n |\n| Rugby union | MLR\nOld Glory DC\n |\n| Soccer | USLC\nLoudoun United FC\nUSL1\nRichmond Kickers\nUSL2\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Beginning with the 1971 football season, the Southwest Conference forbade the inclusion of live animal mascots to away games unless the host school consented. For situations where the host school did not want to allow the Masked Rider's horse, an alternate mascot was needed. Jim Gaspard, a member of the Saddle Tramps student spirit organization, created the original design for the Raider Red costume, basing it on a character created by cartoonist Dirk West, a Texas Tech alumnus and former Lubbock mayor.[60] Though the Masked Rider's identity is public knowledge, it has always been tradition that Raider Red's student alter ego is kept secret until the end of his or her tenure.[61] The student serving as Raider Red is a member of the Saddle Tramps or High Riders.\n\n\n\n\n### Rivalries[edit]\n\n\nSee also: TCU\u2013Texas Tech football rivalry, Texas\u2013Texas Tech football rivalry, and Texas A&M\u2013Texas Tech football rivalry\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAthletic teams that represent Texas Tech University\n\nAthletic teams representing Texas Tech University\n\n\n\n| Texas Tech Red Raiders and\u00a0Lady Raiders |\n| --- |\n| ![Logo](image) |\n| University | Texas Tech University |\n| Conference | Big 12 Conference |\n| NCAA | Division I (FBS) |\n| Athletic director | Kirby Hocutt |\n| Location | Lubbock, Texas |\n| Varsity teams | 17 |\n| Football stadium | Jones AT&T Stadium |\n| Basketball arena | United Supermarkets Arena |\n| Baseball stadium | Dan Law Field at Rip Griffin Park |\n| Soccer stadium | John Walker Soccer Complex |\n| Mascot | Raider Red |\n| Nickname | Red Raiders |\n| Fight song | Fight Raiders, Fight |\n| Colors | Scarlet\u00a0and\u00a0black[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 |\n| Website | www.texastech.com |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Big 12 logo in Texas Tech's colors\nThe **Texas Tech Red Raiders** and **Lady Raiders** are the athletic teams that represent Texas Tech University, located in Lubbock, Texas.

The tradition began in 1936, when \"ghost riders\" circled the field prior to home football games. The Masked Rider became an official mascot in 1954, when Joe Kirk Fulton led the team onto the field at the Gator Bowl. According to reports from those present at the game, the crowd sat in stunned silence as they watched Fulton and his horse, Blackie, rush onto the football field, followed by the team. After a few moments, the silent crowd burst into cheers. Ed Danforth, a writer for the *Atlanta Journal* who witnessed the event, later wrote, \"No team in any bowl game ever made a more sensational entrance.\"[56][57]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n48. **^** \"Jazz Results\u2014Division IA\". *2018 NCA & NDA Collegiate Cheer and Dance Championship*.\n49. **^** \"NCA & NDA College Nationals\".

In one story, football coach Pete Cawthon ordered attractive scarlet uniforms to help the team's identity. The football team, wearing its new outfit, defeated heavily favored Loyola in Los Angeles on October 26, 1934.[54] A Los Angeles sports writer called the Matadors a \"red raiding team\". Other writers who covered Tech sports caught on with the term and successfully promoted the use of \"Red Raiders\". In the other tale, former *Lubbock Avalanche-Journal* sports columnist Collier Parris, reporting on a 1932 Tech football game, wrote: \"The Red Raiders from Texas Tech, terror of the Southwest this year, swooped into the New Mexico University camp today.\" The name soon became popular afterward and by 1936, it officially replaced \"Matadors\" at the same time the Saddle Tramps came about.[52]\n\n\n\n### Spirit[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

The school's athletic program includes 23 varsity sports teams. Their mascot is a Spartan warrior named Sparty, and the school colors are green and white. The university participates in the NCAA's Division I and the Football Bowl Subdivision for football. The Spartans participate as members of the Big Ten Conference in all varsity sports. Michigan State offers 11 varsity sports for men and 12 for women.[4]\n\n\nMSU's football team was consensus national champion in 1952, the (UPI) Coaches' national champion in 1965, and named national champion by different ratings groups in 1951, 1955, 1957, and 1966. They have also won the Rose Bowl in 1954, 1956, 1988 and 2014.[5] Its men's basketball team won the NCAA National Championship in 1979 and 2000.[5] The MSU men's ice hockey team won national titles in 1966, 1986 and 2007.[5]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Michigan State's classic 'S' logo\nFootball has a long tradition at Michigan State. Starting as a club sport in 1884, football gained varsity status in 1896.[30] During that time, the Spartans had a roster of impressive players, including Lynn Chandnois, Dorne Dibble, Meredith Assaly, and Don McAulliffe. In 1951, the Spartans finished the season undefeated, and performed the same feat the following year in addition to the nation's longest winning streak of 24 games. The team was named the \"undisputed national champions by every official poll\".[31]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n26. **^** \"Michigan State vs. North Carolina \u2013 Game Recap \u2013 April 6, 2009 \u2013 ESPN\". *ESPN.com*.

Looking to move beyond its agricultural roots, Michigan State held a contest to find a new nickname. They had decided to call the teams the \"Michigan Staters\". George S. Alderton, a local sports writer for the *Lansing State Journal* decided the name was too cumbersome and went through the entries to find a better and more heroic name. He decided on the \"Spartans\", but sadly forgot to write down who submitted the suggestion.[7]\n\n\nWith a heroic name, the \"Spartans\" quickly caught on as the teams' new nickname. They later changed the lyrics of the Fight Song to reflect the name change of the College and its sports teams.[8]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMichigan State has 21 NCAA Division I-A varsity teams: 10 varsity sports for men and 11 for women. They participate in the Big Ten Conference except fencing, where until 1997, from the University founding, MSU featured fencing as a varsity sport. During that time, MSU was coached by the first American recognized as a master of fencing, Charles Schmitter, for 45 years, from 1939 to 1984. Upon his retirement, his student, Fred Freiheit, coached from 1984 until fencing was demoted from varsity status in 1997. The Michigan State University Fencing Club is a competing member of the Midwest Fencing Conference, which consists of sixteen (16) schools with varsity or club programs.\n\n\n\n### Baseball[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Michigan State Spartans baseball\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

President Samuel Palmer Brooks held a vote to choose a mascot from dozens of options including the buffalo, bookworm, antelope, and ferret. It was then when the student body decided to pick an American black bear as their new mascot. In 1917, troops of the 107th Engineers donated a live bear named Ted to the university. Ted made his debut at the 1917 Baylor\u2013Texas A&M football game.[73] Many years later, a costumed bear first made its appearance at the start of Baylor's 1981\u20131982 basketball season. This version of the bear did not last too long as a different version of the bear appeared in mid- to late-1980s.\n\n\nBruiser was modified two more times until the current version of Bruiser was introduced in late 2000s. In 2017, Baylor Spirit introduced Marigold as Bruiser's partner.[74] Marigold is usually seen wearing a yellow Baylor Line jersey.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIntercollegiate sports teams of Baylor University\n\n\n\n\n\nAthletic teams representing Baylor University\n\n\n\n| Baylor Bears |\n| --- |\n| ![Logo](image) |\n| University | Baylor University |\n| Conference | Big 12 (primary) |\n| NCAA | Division I (FBS) |\n| Athletic director | Mack Rhoades |\n| Location | Waco, Texas |\n| Varsity teams | 18 (7 men's, 10 women's, 1 co-ed) |\n| Football stadium | McLane Stadium |\n| Basketball arena | Ferrell Center |\n| Baseball stadium | Baylor Ballpark |\n| Softball stadium | Getterman Stadium |\n| Soccer stadium | Betty Lou Mays Soccer Field |\n| Tennis venue | Hurd Tennis CenterHawkins Indoor Tennis Center |\n| Mascot | Lady and Joy (live)Bruiser and Marigold (costumed) |\n| Nickname | Bears |\n| Colors | Green\u00a0and\u00a0gold[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 |\n| Website | baylorbears.com |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n74. **^** \"A quick look at Baylor's costumed bear mascots through the years\". *BaylorProud*.

The facility is a United States Department of Agriculture- licensed Class C Zoo.

Joseph Cataldo, a Sicilian-born priest. At one time, Gonzaga went by the nickname of \"Fighting Irish\" in the 1910s to early 1920s. This name was dropped in 1921 favor of the current \"Bulldogs\" mascot. Although the school's official mascot is a bulldog, fans and media have long used \"Zags\" and \u201cGonzos\u201d as alternate nicknames.\n[5][6]\n\n\nGonzaga was an NAIA school from 1947 to 1958,[7][8] when they moved to the NCAA as an independent. They were a charter member of the Big Sky Conference in 1963, the only one of the six without a football program.[9] GU moved over to the West Coast Athletic Conference in the summer of 1979,[10][11][12] and the Big Sky added Nevada,[13] now in the Mountain West Conference. The WCAC was shortened to today's WCC in 1989.[14][15][16]\n\n\n\n## Sports sponsored[edit]\n\n\n### Baseball[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Gonzaga Bulldogs baseball\n\n### Men's basketball[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Gonzaga Bulldogs men's basketball\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Men's sports\n | Women's sports\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Baseball | Basketball |\n| Basketball | Cross country\n |\n| Cross country | Golf\n |\n| Golf | Rowing\n |\n| Rowing | Soccer\n |\n| Soccer | Tennis\n |\n| Tennis | Track and field\u2020 |\n| Track and field\u2020 | Volleyball\n |\n| \u2020 \u2013 Track and field includes both indoor and outdoor |\n\n\nThe **Gonzaga Bulldogs** (/\u0261\u0259n\u02c8z\u00e6\u0261\u0259/), also known unofficially as the **Zags**, are the intercollegiate athletic teams representing Gonzaga University, located in Spokane, Washington, United States.

The team played its home games at Robertson Stadium before it was closed and demolished after the 2012 season. The Cougars divided their home schedule in their first AAC season between Reliant Stadium and BBVA Compass Stadium; the new TDECU Stadium opened on the Robertson Stadium site in 2014.\n\n\nThe Cougars are coached by Dana Holgorsen, who was named head coach in January 2019[5] following the firing on December 30, 2018, of Major Applewhite, under whom the team had gone 0\u20133 in bowl games, including a 70\u201314 loss to Army.[6]\n\n\nThe Cougars joined the Big 12 Conference on July 1, 2023.\n\n\n\n### Basketball[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAlong with the university's other athletic teams, the baseball team is a member of the Big 12 Conference as a Division I team.

This rivalry gave rise to the Houston Cougar Paw tradition.[11]\n\n\n\n## Athletic facilities[edit]\n\n\nMost of the university's major sports facilities are located along Cullen Boulevard, the central traffic artery through the campus. At times in the past, some of the university's teams have played their home games at off-campus venues such as the Astrodome and Rice Stadium. The golf programs compete off campus because they do not have a dedicated golf course on campus.

For football, they are in the Football Bowl Subdivision of Division I (formerly Division I-A).

In 1927, UCLA left the SCIAC and joined the Pacific Coast Conference, the forerunner of the Pac-12 Conference.\n\n\n\n### Nickname and mascot[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Bruins began to use live bears as mascots in the 1930s, renting animals to appear at all UCLA home football games at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. The practice grew less common until the 1950s, when students and alumni brought \"Little Joe Bruin\" to Westwood. A Himalayan bear cub from India, \"Little Joe\" grew too large and was transferred to a circus. \"Josephine\" was purchased by a group of alumni in 1961 and was kept in the backyard of the Rally Committee chairman. She was eventually taken to the San Diego Zoo.[9]\n\n\nA costumed mascot by the name of Joe Bruin was introduced in 1963.[10] In 1967, the first female student to take the mascot role created Josephine \"Josie\" Bruin and joined Joe at athletic events.[8] The design for the costumed bears has changed over the years, and Joe has had at least six looks over his history.[11]\n\n\n\n### Team colors[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| UCLA Bruins |\n| --- |\n| ![Logo](image) |\n| University | University of California, Los Angeles |\n| Conference | Pac-12 (primary)Mountain Pacific Sports Federation (indoor track & field, men's volleyball, water polo) |\n| NCAA | Division I (FBS) |\n| Athletic director | Martin Jarmond |\n| Location | Los Angeles, California |\n| Varsity teams | 25 |\n| Football stadium | Rose Bowl |\n| Basketball arena | Pauley Pavilion |\n| Baseball stadium | Jackie Robinson Stadium |\n| Softball stadium | Easton Stadium |\n| Soccer stadium | Wallis Annenberg Stadium |\n| Other venues | Bel-Air Country ClubDrake StadiumJohn Wooden CenterLos Angeles Tennis CenterSpieker Aquatics CenterSunset Canyon Recreation CenterUCLA Marina Aquatic Center |\n| Mascot | Joe & Josephine (Josie) Bruin |\n| Nickname | Bruins |\n| Fight song | \"Sons of Westwood\" |\n| Colors | Blue\u00a0and\u00a0gold[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 |\n| Website | www.uclabruins.com |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Men | * Augustana Vikings\n* Austin Kangaroos\n* California Golden Bears\n* Penn State Behrend Lions\n* Stanford Cardinal\n* UCLA Bruins\n* USC Trojans\n |\n| Women | * Arizona State Sun Devils\n* California Golden Bears\n* Indiana Hoosiers\n* San Jose State Spartans\n* Stanford Cardinal\n* UCLA Bruins\n* USC Trojans\n |\n\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Style Guide // UCLA Athletics for Print and Digital Applications\" (PDF). *UCLA Nike Jordan Style Guide*.

KU basketball also has two Helms Foundation National Titles.\n\n\n\n\n## Mascot[edit]\n\n\n### Origins of \"Jayhawk\"[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Jayhawker\n\n![](image)Big 12 logo in Kansas' colors\nThe name \"Jayhawk\" comes from the Kansas Jayhawker militias during the Bleeding Kansas era of the American Civil War.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIntercollegiate sports teams of the University of Kansas\n\n\n\n\n\nAthletic teams representing The University of Kansas\n\n\n\n| Kansas Jayhawks |\n| --- |\n| ![Logo](image) |\n| University | The University of Kansas |\n| Conference | Big 12 Conference |\n| NCAA | Division I (FBS) |\n| Athletic director | Travis Goff |\n| Location | Lawrence, Kansas |\n| Varsity teams | 16 |\n| Football stadium | David Booth Kansas Memorial Stadium |\n| Basketball arena | Allen Fieldhouse |\n| Baseball stadium | Hoglund Ballpark |\n| Softball stadium | Arrocha Ballpark |\n| Soccer stadium | Rock Chalk Park |\n| Other venues | Anschutz PavilionRim Rock FarmHorejsi Family Volleyball ArenaRobinson NatatoriumJayhawk Tennis CenterKansas River Boathouse |\n| Mascot | Big Jay and Baby Jay |\n| Fight song | I'm a Jayhawk |\n| Cheer | Rock Chalk, Jayhawk |\n| Colors | Crimson\u00a0and\u00a0blue[1]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 |\n| Website | kuathletics.com ![Edit this at Wikidata](image) |\n| ![](image) |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n16. **^** \"The Mascots\". *KU.edu*.

The term came to be applied to people or items related to Kansas. When the University of Kansas fielded their first football team in 1890, like many universities at that time, they had no official mascot. They used many different independent mascots, including a pig. Eventually, sometime during the 1890s, the team was referred to as the Jayhawkers by the student body.[10] Over time, the name was gradually supplanted by its shorter variant, and KU's sports teams are now almost exclusively known as the Jayhawks. The Jayhawk appears in several Kansas cheers, most notably, the \"Rock Chalk, Jayhawk\" chant in unison before and during games.[11] In the traditions promoted by KU, the jayhawk is said to be a combination of two birds, \"the blue jay, a noisy, quarrelsome thing known to rob other nests, and the sparrow hawk, a stealthy hunter.\"[12]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Teams | * Baseball\n* Men's basketball\n* Women's basketball\n* Football\n* Crew Team\n |\n| Mascots | * Big Jay\n* Baby Jay\n |\n| Facilities | * Allen Fieldhouse\n* David Booth Kansas Memorial Stadium\n* Hoglund Ballpark\n |\n| Misc. | * *Rock Chalk, Jayhawk*\n* Border War\n* Sunflower Showdown\n |\n\n |\n| Campus | * Bailey Hall\n* Budig Hall\n* Danforth Chapel\n* Kenneth Spencer Research Library\n* Lied Center of Kansas\n* Natural History Museum\n* Robert J.

The name Tar Heel is a nickname used to refer to individuals from the state of North Carolina, the *Tar Heel State*. The campus at Chapel Hill is referred to as the *University of North Carolina* for the purposes of the National Collegiate Athletic Association.[2] The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill was chartered in 1789, and in 1795 it became the first state-supported university in the United States.[3] Since the school fostered the oldest collegiate team in the Carolinas, the school took on the nickname **Carolina**, especially in athletics.

Because of the ambiguity, the student newspaper, the *Trinity Chronicle* (now called *The Chronicle*) launched a campaign to create a new mascot. Nominations for a new team name included Catamounts, Grizzlies, Badgers, Dreadnaughts, and Captains. The Trinity Chronicle editor narrowed the many nominations down to those that utilized the school colors of dark blue and white. The narrowed list consisted of Blue Titans, Blue Eagles, polar bears, Blue Devils, Royal Blazes, and Blue Warriors. None of the nominations proved to be a clear favorite, but the name Blue Devils elicited criticism that could potentially engender opposition on campus. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| College athletics(NCAA Division I) | FBS\nAppalachian State Mountaineers\nCharlotte 49ers\nDuke Blue Devils\nEast Carolina Pirates\nNorth Carolina Tar Heels\nNC State Wolfpack\nWake Forest Demon Deacons\nFCS\nCampbell Camels\nDavidson Wildcats\nElon Phoenix\nGardner-Webb Bulldogs\nNorth Carolina A&T Aggies\nNorth Carolina Central Eagles\nWestern Carolina Catamounts\nNon-football\nHigh Point Panthers\nQueens Royals\nUNC Asheville Bulldogs\nUNC Greensboro Spartans\nUNC Wilmington Seahawks\n |\n| See also\nSports in North Carolina\nList of sports venues in North Carolina\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Atlantic Coast Conference logo in Duke's colors\nThe **Duke Blue Devils** are the intercollegiate athletic teams that represent Duke University, located in Durham, North Carolina.

All of UConn's huskies are named Jonathan in honor of Jonathan Trumbull, the last colonial and first state Governor of Connecticut.[1] (There have been two other governors of Connecticut with similar names: Jonathan Trumbull Jr. (1797 - 1809) and John H. Trumbull (1925-1931). The student body president at the time of the mascot naming later cited the name of the mascot as coming from the most recent Governor Trumbull, a near contemporary.)[2] Traditionally, there are two Jonathan mascots: one is a student in a costume which resembles the university's Athletics logo, and the other is a live husky canine.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| NCAA national championships in bold; NCAA Final Four appearances in italics\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nMascots of the Big East Conference\n |\n| --- |\n| * **Butler Blue IV** (Butler)\n* **Billy the Bluejay** (Creighton)\n* **DIBS** (DePaul)\n* **Jack the Bulldog** (Georgetown)\n* **Golden Eagle** (Marquette)\n* **The Friar** (Providence)\n* **Johnny the Thunderbird** (St. John's)\n* **Seton Hall Pirate** (Seton Hall)\n* **Jonathan the Husky** (UConn)\n* **Will D.

Jonathan is one of the few university mascots in the nation to have been selected by students via a popular poll (in 1933).\n\n\nThe co-ed service fraternity Alpha Phi Omega has helped to care for the canine Jonathan since 1970 when the Student Government wanted to get rid of the mascot.[3][4]\n\n\n\n\n## Jonathan I[edit]\n\n\nServed as mascot from July 23, 1934\u2013February 1935\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

He is an anthropomorphic white ibis with a Miami Hurricanes football jersey, number 0.[1]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nThe ibis was chosen as Miami's unofficial mascot by Nathan Duncan in 1926, after the University of Miami student body chose the school's yearbook's name to be *The Ibis*.[2]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\"Miami adopted a native marsh bird called the Ibis as the official mascot in 1926. The Ibis is known for its bravery as a hurricane approaches. Folklore maintains that other birds look to the Ibis for leadership. The Ibis uses its instinct to detect danger. It is the last sign of wildlife to take shelter before a hurricane hits, giving warning that danger is imminent. As the storm passes the Ibis is the first to reappear, a sign that clear skies are approaching.\"[2][3]\nThe first official mascot for the Miami Hurricanes was a 65-pound brown and white boxer dog named Hurricane I. Chosen in 1950, the canine wore a ceremonial orange and green blanket with his name lettered in white.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nUniversity of Miami\n |\n| --- |\n| **Located in:** Coral Gables, Florida\n |\n| Academics | * College of Arts and Sciences\n* School of Architecture\n* College of Engineering\n* School of Business\n* School of Communication\n* School of Education\n* School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Science\n* School of Music\n* School of Nursing and Health Studies\n\n\n* School of Law\n* School of Medicine\n* The Graduate School\n |\n| Athletics | * Hurricanes\n* ACC\n\n\n* Baseball\n* Basketball (men's)\n* Basketball (women's)\n* Football\n* Soccer (women's)\n\n\n* Bowl games\n* Florida Cup\n* Florida rivalry\n* Florida State rivalry\n* Nebraska rivalry\n* Virginia Tech rivalry\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nMiami Hurricanes football\n |\n| --- |\n| Venues | * Miami Orange Bowl (1937\u20132007)\n* Hard Rock Stadium (2008\u2013present)\n |\n| Bowls and rivalries | * Bowl games\n* Florida\n* Florida State\n* Nebraska\n* Virginia Tech\n |\n| Culture and lore | * 1998 UCLA game\n* 2011 athletics scandal\n* Band of the Hour\n* Catholics vs. Convicts\n* FIU\u2013Miami brawl\n* Florida Cup\n* Hail Flutie\n* Miami 4\u20133 defense\n* Quarterback U\n* Sebastian the Ibis\n* Whammy in Miami\n* Wide Right I\n* Wide Right II\n* Confusion Bowl\n* 2023 Georgia Tech game\n |\n| Documentaries | * *Catholics vs. Convicts*\n* *The U*\n |\n| People | * Head coaches\n* NFL draftees\n* Statistical leaders\n |\n| Early years (1926 to 1978) | * Miami Hurricanes football (1926 to 1978)\n |\n| Seasons | * 1926\n* 1927\n* 1928\n* 1929\n* 1930\n* 1931\n* 1932\n* 1933\n* 1934\n* 1935\n* 1936\n* 1937\n* 1938\n* 1939\n* 1940\n* 1941\n* 1942\n* 1943\n* 1944\n* 1945\n* 1946\n* 1947\n* 1948\n* 1949\n* 1950\n* 1951\n* 1952\n* 1953\n* 1954\n* 1955\n* 1956\n* 1957\n* 1958\n* 1959\n* 1960\n* 1961\n* 1962\n* 1963\n* 1964\n* 1965\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Owlsley and Hoot are the names of the mascots for Florida Atlantic University. The presence of this bird has been popular on the land of the university, even preceding the construction of FAU. At the dedication ceremony in 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson even made notice and reference to the popular presence of the bird.[5] In 1971, the National Audubon Society designated FAU's land an official owl sanctuary, honoring the tradition of the bird's presence and moving to protect the birds from attempts to expand construction of the university. Owls are still dominant in their presence on the Boca Raton campus to this day. With the addition of intercollegiate athletics in the mid-1980s, the university used the bird as its mascot - an animal that denotes wisdom, determination and cognizance.\n\n\n\n### Conference affiliations[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n## Facilities[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Sport\n | Facility\n | Capacity\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Football | FAU Stadium | 29,571\n |\n| Men's & Women's Basketball/Volleyball | Eleanor R.

FAU fielded its first marching band in the 2002 football season, collectively called the Florida Atlantic Marching Owls.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe **Florida Atlantic Owls** are the athletics teams of Florida Atlantic University. The Owls participate in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA)'s Division I as members of the American Athletic Conference. On October 21, 2021, Florida Atlantic accepted the invitation to join The American and became a full member on July 1, 2023.[2]\n\n\nFlorida Atlantic has attracted high-profile coaches in the past for various sports, including Howard Schnellenberger and Lane Kiffin for football and Mike Jarvis for basketball. Other former coaches include Matt Doherty, Rex Walters, and Sidney Green. As of March 2018, the Owls are led by athletic director Brian White.[3] The 2023 men's basketball team made school history by making the Final Four of the 2023 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament.[4]\n\n\n\n\n## The Owls[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nDivision I college sports teams of Florida\n |\n| --- |\n| * Bethune\u2013Cookman Wildcats\n* FIU Panthers\n* Florida Gators\n* Florida A&M Rattlers and Lady Rattlers\n* Florida Atlantic Owls\n* Florida Gulf Coast Eagles\n* Florida State Seminoles\n* Jacksonville Dolphins\n* Miami Hurricanes\n* North Florida Ospreys\n* South Florida Bulls\n* Stetson Hatters\n* UCF Knights\n | ![](image)\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Division\n | Years\n | Conference affiliation\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| NAIA District 25 | 1979\u201380 to 1982\u201383 | Independent\n |\n| NCAA Division II | 1983\u201384 to 1992\u201393\n |\n| NCAA Division I | 1993\u201394 to 2005\u201306 | Trans America Athletic Conference(now ASUN Conference)\n |\n| 2006\u201307 to 2012\u201313 | Sun Belt Conference |\n| 2013\u201314 to 2022\u201323 | Conference USA |\n| 2023\u201324 to present | American Athletic Conference |\n\n\n## Sports sponsored[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Men's sports\n | Women's sports\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Baseball | Basketball |\n| Basketball | Beach volleyball[a] |\n| Cross country | Cross country\n |\n| Football | Golf\n |\n| Golf | Soccer\n |\n| Soccer | Softball |\n| Swimming and diving[b] | Swimming and diving\n |\n| Tennis | Tennis\n |\n|  | Track and field\u2020 |\n|  | Volleyball\n |\n| \u2020 \u2013 Track and field includes both indoor and outdoor |\n\n\n![](image)Conference USA logo in Florida Atlantic's colors\n### Football[edit]\n\n\n![](image)FAU Stadium, current home of the Owls football team\nSee also: FAU Stadium and Florida Atlantic Owls football\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n9. **^** \"Baseball to kick off season Friday - Sports\".
