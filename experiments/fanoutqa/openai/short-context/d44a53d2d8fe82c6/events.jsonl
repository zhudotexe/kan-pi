Five of the dice are shaped like the Platonic solids, whose faces are regular polygons. Aside from the cube, the other four Platonic solids have 4, 8, 12, and 20 faces, allowing for those number ranges to be generated. The only other common non-cubical die is the 10-sided die, a pentagonal trapezohedron die, whose faces are ten kites, each with two different edge lengths, three different angles, and two different kinds of vertices. Such sets frequently include a second 10-sided die either of contrasting color or numbered by tens, allowing the pair of 10-sided dice to be combined to generate numbers between 1 and 100.\n\n\nUsing these dice in various ways, games can closely approximate a variety of probability distributions. For instance, 10-sided dice can be rolled in pairs to produce a uniform distribution of random percentages, and summing the values of multiple dice will produce approximations to normal distributions.[29]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Faces/Sides\n | Shape\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 4 | Tetrahedron | ![Tetrahedron](image) | Each face has three numbers, arranged such that the upright number, placed either near the vertex or near the opposite edge, is the same on all three visible faces.

A pair of common dice is usual, though other forms of polyhedra can be used. Tibetan Buddhists sometimes use this method of divination.

One variation on the standard die is known as the \"average\" die.[34][35] These are six-sided dice with sides numbered `2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5`, which have the same arithmetic mean as a standard die (3.5 for a single die, 7 for a pair of dice), but have a narrower range of possible values (2 through 5 for one, 4 through 10 for a pair). They are used in some table-top wargames, where a narrower range of numbers is required.[35] Other numbered variations include Sicherman dice and intransitive dice.\n\n\n\n### Spherical dice[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_AairlRtCWvwYyMnhC2ZPUsYK","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

Such dice are commonly referred to as d*n* where *n* is the number of faces (d8, d20, etc.); see dice notation for more details.\n\n\nThese shapes frequently show up in other games or puzzles. Puzzles similar to a Rubik's Cube come in all five shapes â€“ see magic polyhedra.\n\n\n\n### Liquid crystals with symmetries of Platonic solids[edit]\n\n\nFor the intermediate material phase called liquid crystals, the existence of such symmetries was first proposed in 1981 by H. Kleinert and K. Maki.[12][13]\nIn aluminum the icosahedral structure was discovered three years after this by Dan Shechtman, which earned him the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2011.\n\n\n\n## Related polyhedra and polytopes[edit]\n\n\n### Uniform polyhedra[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* All of its faces are congruent convex regular polygons.\n* None of its faces intersect except at their edges.\n* The same number of faces meet at each of its vertices.\n\n\nEach Platonic solid can therefore be assigned a pair {*p*,Â *q*} of integers, where *p* is the number of edges (or, equivalently, vertices) of each face, and *q* is the number of faces (or, equivalently, edges) that meet at each vertex. This pair {*p*,Â *q*}, called the SchlÃ¤fli symbol, gives a combinatorial description of the polyhedron. The SchlÃ¤fli symbols of the five Platonic solids are given in the table below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThese coordinates reveal certain relationships between the Platonic solids: the vertices of the tetrahedron represent half of those of the cube, as {4,3} or ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image), one of two sets of 4 vertices in dual positions, as h{4,3} or ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image). Both tetrahedral positions make the compound stellated octahedron.\n\n\nThe coordinates of the icosahedron are related to two alternated sets of coordinates of a nonuniform truncated octahedron, t{3,4} or ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image), also called a *snub octahedron*, as s{3,4} or ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image), and seen in the compound of two icosahedra.\n\n\nEight of the vertices of the dodecahedron are shared with the cube. Completing all orientations leads to the compound of five cubes.\n\n\n\n## Combinatorial properties[edit]\n\n\nA convex polyhedron is a Platonic solid if and only if all three of the following requirements are met.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGeometers have studied the Platonic solids for thousands of years.[1] They are named for the ancient Greek philosopher Plato who hypothesized in one of his dialogues, the *Timaeus*, that the classical elements were made of these regular solids.[2]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kepler's Platonic solid model of the Solar System from *Mysterium Cosmographicum* (1596)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nAssignment to the elements in Kepler's *Mysterium Cosmographicum*\n\nThe Platonic solids have been known since antiquity. It has been suggested that certain carved stone balls created by the late Neolithic people of Scotland represent these shapes; however, these balls have rounded knobs rather than being polyhedral, the numbers of knobs frequently differed from the numbers of vertices of the Platonic solids, there is no ball whose knobs match the 20 vertices of the dodecahedron, and the arrangement of the knobs was not always symmetric.[3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nConvex polyhedron with identical, regular polygon faces\n\nIn geometry, a **Platonic solid** is a convex, regular polyhedron in three-dimensional Euclidean space. Being a regular polyhedron means that the faces are congruent (identical in shape and size) regular polygons (all angles congruent and all edges congruent), and the same number of faces meet at each vertex. There are only five such polyhedra:\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Tetrahedron | Cube | Octahedron | Dodecahedron | Icosahedron |\n| Four faces\n | Six faces\n | Eight faces\n | Twelve faces\n | Twenty faces\n |\n| ![](image)\n(Animation, 3D model)\n | ![](image)\n(Animation, 3D model)\n | ![](image)\n(Animation, 3D model)\n | ![](image)\n(Animation, 3D model)\n | ![](image)\n(Animation, 3D model)\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n1. Each vertex of the solid must be a vertex for at least three faces.\n2. At each vertex of the solid, the total, among the adjacent faces, of the angles between their respective adjacent sides must be strictly less than 360Â°. The amount less than 360Â° is called an angle defect.\n3. Regular polygons of six or more sides have only angles of 120Â° or more, so the common face must be the triangle, square, or pentagon. For these different shapes of faces the following holds:\nTriangular faces\nEach vertex of a regular triangle is 60Â°, so a shape may have three, four, or five triangles meeting at a vertex; these are the tetrahedron, octahedron, and icosahedron respectively.\nSquare faces\nEach vertex of a square is 90Â°, so there is only one arrangement possible with three faces at a vertex, the cube.\nPentagonal faces\nEach vertex is 108Â°; again, only one arrangement of three faces at a vertex is possible, the dodecahedron.\nAltogether this makes five possible Platonic solids.\n\n### Topological proof[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* *Platonic solids* at Encyclopaedia of Mathematics\n* Weisstein, Eric W. \"Platonic solid\". *MathWorld*.\n* Weisstein, Eric W. \"Isohedron\". *MathWorld*.\n* Book XIII of Euclid's *Elements*.\n* Interactive 3D Polyhedra in Java\n* Platonic Solids in Visual Polyhedra\n* Solid Body Viewer is an interactive 3D polyhedron viewer which allows you to save the model in svg, stl or obj format.\n* Interactive Folding/Unfolding Platonic Solids Archived 2007-02-09 at the Wayback Machine in Java\n* Paper models of the Platonic solids created using nets generated by Stella software\n* Platonic Solids Free paper models (nets)\n* Grime, James; Steckles, Katie. \"Platonic Solids\". *Numberphile*.

The high degree of symmetry of the Platonic solids can be interpreted in a number of ways. Most importantly, the vertices of each solid are all equivalent under the action of the symmetry group, as are the edges and faces. One says the action of the symmetry group is transitive on the vertices, edges, and faces. In fact, this is another way of defining regularity of a polyhedron: a polyhedron is *regular* if and only if it is vertex-uniform, edge-uniform, and face-uniform.\n\n\nThere are only three symmetry groups associated with the Platonic solids rather than five, since the symmetry group of any polyhedron coincides with that of its dual. This is easily seen by examining the construction of the dual polyhedron. Any symmetry of the original must be a symmetry of the dual and vice versa. The three polyhedral groups are:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the mid-19th century the Swiss mathematician Ludwig SchlÃ¤fli discovered the four-dimensional analogues of the Platonic solids, called convex regular 4-polytopes. There are exactly six of these figures; five are analogous to the Platonic solidsÂ : 5-cell as {3,3,3}, 16-cell as {3,3,4}, 600-cell as {3,3,5}, tesseract as {4,3,3}, and 120-cell as {5,3,3}, and a sixth one, the self-dual 24-cell, {3,4,3}.\n\n\nIn all dimensions higher than four, there are only three convex regular polytopes: the simplex as {3,3,...,3}, the hypercube as {4,3,...,3}, and the cross-polytope as {3,3,...,4}.[14] In three dimensions, these coincide with the tetrahedron as {3,3}, the cube as {4,3}, and the octahedron as {3,4}.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Archimedean solid\n* Catalan solid\n* Deltahedron\n* Johnson solid\n* Goldberg solid\n* Kepler solids\n* List of regular polytopes\n* Prince Rupert's cube\n* Regular polytopes\n* Regular skew polyhedron\n* Toroidal polyhedron\n\n## Citations[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_KGbhj0GbZr1T0374gWD5VcTv","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
