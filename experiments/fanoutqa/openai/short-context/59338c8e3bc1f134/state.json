Medals won in the 1906 Intercalated Games are not included. (If they were, Ray Ewry would be second on the list with 10 gold). It includes top-three placings in 1896 and 1900, before medals were awarded for top-three placings. The Olympics listed for each athlete **only include games in which they won medals**. See the particular article on the athlete for more details on when and for what nation an athlete competed. More medals are available in some events than others, and the number of events in which medals are available overall has changed over time. \n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* List of multiple Olympic gold medalists at a single Games\n* List of multiple Olympic gold medalists in one event\n* List of multiple Olympic medalists\n* List of multiple Olympic medalists at a single Games\n* List of multiple Olympic medalists in one event\n* List of multiple Paralympic gold medalists\n* All-time Olympic Games medal table\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** Coubertin, Pierre de; Timoleon J.

American athletes amassed 45 gold and 107 total medals, 16 gold and 16 total medals more than the second-placed Soviets. The US swimming team dominated the competition, winning a staggering 51 medals and sweeping the podium on five occasions. The Americans also managed to medal in every single of 29 swimming events, thus achieving a unique feat. The US track and field team pulled off a stellar performance as well with 15 gold and 28 total medals. Overall, swimming and athletics accounted for more than 70% of all US medals and ensured the first place in the medal table for the Americans, their second consecutive first-place finish in terms of gold medals, and their first finish at the top of the overall medal table since 1952. In other sports, however, the performance of American athletes was less convincing. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| ![](image) Mountain biking | 0 | 0 | 2 | 2 |\n| ![](image) Skateboarding | 0 | 0 | 2 | 2 |\n| ![](image) Karate | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |\n| Totals (47 entries) | 1061 | 829 | 737 | 2627 |\n\n*Updated on December 31, 2021*\n\\**This table does not include two medals \u2013 one silver awarded in the ice hockey and one bronze awarded in the figure skating events at the 1920 Summer Olympics.*\nThe United States has never won an Olympic medal in the following current summer sports or disciplines: badminton, handball, rhythmic gymnastics, table tennis and trampoline gymnastics.\n | Medals by winter sport[edit]\n**Leading in that sport**\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe United States of America has sent many athletes to the celebration of the Olympic Games, starting with the first modern Olympics held in 1896. The United States has sent athletes to every Olympic Games with the exception of the 1980 Summer Olympics, during which it led a boycott in protest of the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan. The United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee (USOPC) is the National Olympic Committee for the United States.\n\n\nAmerican athletes have won a total of 2,629 medals (1,061 of them gold) at the Summer Olympic Games, and another 330 (113 of them gold) at the Winter Olympic Games. This makes the United States the most prolific medal-winning nation in the history of the Olympics.

Swimming was the only sport where the American team did not disappoint, winning 17 gold and 43 total medals, a good result, but still less than four years earlier.

They were still disadvantaged by these rules in those sports where they weren't abolished (i.e., boxing, baseball, where Cubans continued to field state-sponsored pros against American amateurs), but the situation started improving.\n\n\n\n### Recent period (1994\u2013present)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | This section **needs expansion**.

Particularly successful was the US swimming team that won 13 out of available 18 golds and shattered 9 world records. In track and field, the Americans also improved on their 1960 performance, winning 14 gold and 24 total medals, while the Soviets left Japan with 5 gold and 18 total medals, a significant downturn compared to their 1960 results. The Soviets, however, continued to dominate Olympic weightlifting, and, with the American program falling apart, the USSR produced four golds and three silvers. The Soviet Union hoped to replicate that success in gymnastics and wrestling, the sports that, together with weightlifting, were strongly associated with their athletic prowess. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n10 Soviet golds in gymnastics didn't surprise anyone, as the nation had always been a gymnastics powerhouse, but it did mean that the Soviets beat the Americans in the medal standings for the second straight summer games. The US basketball team, however, met the pre-tournament expectations and won its fifth consecutive gold medal, a noble feat, given that they had to compete against veteran pros from the USSR. The final result, 43 gold and 103 total medals for the Soviets to 34 gold and 71 total medals for the Americans, showed that America was no longer a leading force in Olympic competition.[22]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe US weightlifting team continued to fade away, winning just one medal (compared to 7 in 1956), American boxers won 7 medals, though only two of them gold, US divers won 6 medals, and the men's volleyball team managed to stun the defending champions from the Soviet Union, beating them in five sets, but still finished out of medals; Soviets ultimately won gold, with their lone loss being to the US. In gymnastics, Japan continued to frustrate the Soviets, once again surpassing them in the medal standings. Last but not least, the US basketball team won its seventh consecutive gold medal, a feat not matched by any other Olympic team in ball sports. Very few would have assumed that this was the last time that the US finished first in the medal table in a fully attended Summer Olympics until 1996 (the Americans would top the medal standings in 1984 with the Soviet Union and its satellites boycotting).[24]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe achievement was even more notable due to the fact that the American boxers were significantly younger and less experienced than their Cuban and Soviet counterparts.[29] In other sports, US divers won five medals, including two golds; the US equestrian team took home four medals; American shooters won three medals, including a historic silver by a woman in the mixed 50 meters rifle three positions; US freestyle wrestlers advanced to four gold medal bouts, yet won only one of them (all four were against the Soviets), concluding the meet with six medals overall. The US men's basketball team reclaimed the gold medal, while the women's team won a surprising silver, being ranked no higher than sixth prior to the start of the tournament. The Soviets and East Germans were unstoppable in canoeing, gymnastics, rowing, weightlifting and wrestling, going 1\u20132 in the overall medal standings (49 gold and 125 total medals for the Soviets, and 40 gold and 90 total medals for East Germans). \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Sport | Gold | Silver | Bronze | Total |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Athletics | 344 | 269 | 214 | 827 |\n| ![](image) Swimming | 257 | 178 | 143 | 578 |\n| ![](image) Shooting | 57 | 31 | 28 | 116 |\n| ![](image) Wrestling | 55 | 44 | 39 | 138 |\n| ![](image) Boxing | 50 | 27 | 40 | 117 |\n| ![](image) Diving | 49 | 46 | 46 | 141 |\n| ![](image) Artistic gymnastics | 37 | 43 | 37 | 117 |\n| ![](image) Rowing | 33 | 32 | 24 | 89 |\n| ![](image) Basketball | 25 | 2 | 3 | 30 |\n| ![](image) Tennis | 21 | 6 | 12 | 39 |\n| ![](image) Sailing | 19 | 23 | 19 | 61 |\n| ![](image) Weightlifting | 16 | 17 | 11 | 44 |\n| ![](image) Archery | 14 | 10 | 9 | 33 |\n| ![](image) Equestrian | 11 | 23 | 20 | 54 |\n| ![](image) Track cycling | 11 | 15 | 13 | 39 |\n| ![](image) Beach volleyball | 7 | 2 | 2 | 11 |\n| ![](image) Road cycling | 5 | 4 | 4 | 13 |\n| ![](image) Golf | 5 | 3 | 5 | 13 |\n| ![](image) Canoe sprint | 5 | 3 | 4 | 12 |\n| ![](image) Artistic swimming | 5 | 2 | 2 | 9 |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe 1960 Rome Olympics saw the Americans losing their grip on their traditionally successful sports, such as track and field and weightlifting. On the other hand, boxing, swimming (where the Americans won 9 gold medals, while being controversially denied gold in the 100 meters freestyle, despite showing the best time), and wrestling produced unexpectedly good results, which somewhat helped to compensate for what was lost in other sports. In track and field, the Soviets won 11 golds, only one less than the Americans. It is worth mentioning that the US team encountered many problems throughout the meet, such as a controversial disqualification of their gold medal-winning men's 4x100 relay team. In weightlifting, the Soviets, with the help of their state-of-the-art doping program, won five out of seven events, leaving the US with only one gold. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nU.S. athletes have appeared in every Summer Olympics in recent decades. The United States, represented by the United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee (USOPC), competed at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. Originally scheduled to take place in the summer of 2020, the Games were postponed to July 23 to August 8, 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[39] The opening ceremony flag-bearers for the United States were baseball player Eddy Alvarez and basketball player Sue Bird.[40] Javelin thrower Kara Winger was the flag-bearer for the closing ceremony.[41] When USA Gymnastics announced that 2016 Olympic all-around champion Biles would not participate in the gymnastics all-around final, the spotlight fell on her American team-mates. The U.S. had won the event in each of the last five Olympic Games: a formidable winning streak was on the line. Sunisa Lee embraced the moment and stood tall to deliver for her country. She totaled 57.433 to hold off Rebeca Andrade of Brazil (57.298) to clinch the title. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThat would start a significant controversy, that will result in the amateur rules being abolished, though only in the 1990s, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, meaning that the Soviets benefited from those rules throughout their Olympic history.[18] The United States still topped the medal count at these games, winning 40 gold and 76 total medals, 22 gold and 5 total medals more than the Soviets who finished second. American athletes won 31 medals in track and field, their most successful sport. US basketball team won its third consecutive gold, twice defeating the Soviets in the process, American boxers won all five finals they entered, and American weightlifters edged their Soviet rivals 4 to 3 in terms of gold medals, with the two nations sweeping all seven events in the sport.[19][20]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn weightlifting, the Americans and Soviets once again won all seven events, once again with a 4 to 3 ratio in favor of the US team. In boxing, the Soviets won 3 golds, while the Americans only managed to win two events. However, it was gymnastics where the USSR achieved its greatest success, winning 11 out of 17 events and guaranteeing the first place in the medal rankings. The US basketball team won its fourth consecutive gold, beating the Soviets in the final game, 89\u201355.[21]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n![](image) Summer Olympics medal table leaders by year\n |\n| --- |\n| * 1896: ![](image)\u00a0United States\n* 1900: ![](image)\u00a0France\n* 1904: ![](image)\u00a0United States\n* 1908: ![](image)\u00a0Great Britain\n* 1912: ![](image)\u00a0United States\n* 1920: ![](image)\u00a0United States\n* 1924: ![](image)\u00a0United States\n* 1928: ![](image)\u00a0United States\n* 1932: ![](image)\u00a0United States\n* 1936: ![](image)\u00a0Germany\n* 1948: ![](image)\u00a0United States\n* 1952: ![](image)\u00a0United States\n* 1956: ![](image)\u00a0Soviet Union\n* 1960: ![](image)\u00a0Soviet Union\n* 1964: ![](image)\u00a0United States\n* 1968: ![](image)\u00a0United States\n* 1972: ![](image)\u00a0Soviet Union\n* 1976: ![](image)\u00a0Soviet Union\n* 1980: ![](image)\u00a0Soviet Union\n* 1984: ![](image)\u00a0United States\n* 1988: ![](image)\u00a0Soviet Union\n* 1992: ![](image)\u00a0Unified Team\n* 1996: ![](image)\u00a0United States\n* 2000: ![](image)\u00a0United States\n* 2004: ![](image)\u00a0United States\n* 2008: ![](image)\u00a0China\n* 2012: ![](image)\u00a0United States\n* 2016: ![](image)\u00a0United States\n* 2020: ![](image)\u00a0United States\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

The nation's first gold medal in the sport is a disputed one; Michel Th\u00e9ato was Luxembourgish but living in Paris; his win in the 1900 marathon is credited to France by the International Olympic Committee, which rejected a petition by Luxembourg to change the Olympic record of Th\u00e9ato's nationality.[3]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Games\n | Athletes\n | Events | Gold | Silver | Bronze\n | Total\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1896 Athens | 5 | 9/12 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2\n |\n| 1900 Paris | 23 | 18/23 | 1 | 4 | 2 | 7\n |\n| Total |  |  | 14 | 27 | 29 | 70\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe modern Olympic Games were founded by French historian Pierre de Coubertin. France has competed in every edition (both Summer and Winter), with the possible exception of the 1904 Games (as sources disagree about whether athlete Albert Corey competed for the United States or France[1][2]).\n\n\nFrench athletes have won 751 medals at the Summer Olympic Games in a wide variety of sports, achieving particular success in fencing and cycling. France has won an additional 138 medals at the Winter Olympic Games, mostly in alpine skiing.\n\n\n\n\n## Hosted Games[edit]\n\n\n![France at the Olympics is located in France](image)![1900,1924,2024](image)\n**1900**,**1924**,**2024**\n![1924](image)\n**1924**\n![1968](image)\n**1968**\n![1992](image)\n**1992**\nclass=notpageimage|\nFrench host cities of the Olympic Games\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Games\n | Players\n | Events | Gold | Silver | Bronze\n | Total\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1900 Paris | 17 | 1/1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1\n |\n| 1920 Antwerp | 15 | 1/1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1\n |\n| 1924 Paris | 30 | 1/1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1\n |\n| 2016 Rio de Janeiro | 25 | 2/2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n |\n| Total |  |  | 1 | 2 | 0 | 3\n |\n\n\n### Sailing[edit]\n\n\nFrance hosted the first Olympic sailing competitions in 1900, earning 24 total medals in the 13 events, including 5 golds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFrance hosted the inaugural Olympic rowing contests in Paris 1900.

France did not play in 1908, but returned in 1920 (losing the single match to the United States) and 1924 (beating Romania but losing again to the United States).\n\n\nWith the return of rugby, in the form of rugby sevens, in 2016, France competed again. France had both men's and women's teams in 2016; both advanced out of pool play to the quarterfinals but were defeated there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFrance competed at two of the five editions of Olympic polo tournaments, both occasions when Paris hosted the Games in 1900 and 1924. The nation is formally credited with no medals, though French players competed on a mixed team in 1900 (along with a British player) that took bronze. France had a fully-French team as well in 1900, which took fifth place. Both the all-French and the mixed team went 0\u20131 (losing to the same team), with the mixed team placed higher due to a bye. The French team in 1924 went 0\u20134 in the round-robin tournament. Thus, the overall Olympic record of teams with French polo players is 0\u20136.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Games\n | Players\n | Events | Gold | Silver | Bronze\n | Total\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1900 Paris | 7 | 1/1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0[6] |\n| 1924 Paris | 5 | 1/1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n |\n| Total |  |  | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0[6] |\n\n\n### Rowing[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n### Gymnastics[edit]\n\n\nFrance had one gymnast participate in one event in the inaugural 1896 Games.

Great Britain's first gymnastics medal came in 1908 with a silver in the men's individual all-around. Until 2008, Great Britain's last medal for gymnastics was a Bronze in the Women's all-round team event in 1928. At the 2012 Summer Games in London, Great Britain equaled its tally for all previous games combined, winning 4 medals to bring their all-time total to eight. A record seven medals, including first ever gold medals, were won in 2016, while a further three, including one gold, were won at the 2020 Games. Having won only four medals in total between 1896 and 2008, 14 medals, including 3 gold medals were secured between 2012 and 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAt the Winter Olympics as a non-alpine team Great Britain has historically been unable to replicate the amount of success they have achieved in the Summer Olympics although the team enjoyed gold medal success at figure skating through the seventies and eighties, while in recent years, the expansion of the Winter Olympics to include sports such as Curling, Snowboarding, Skeleton and Freestyle skiing has brought some renewed success. Currently, Great Britain is the most successful team in women's skeleton, having won a medal six times, and every gold medal from 2010 to 2018. The most successful Winter Olympian from the Great Britain team is Lizzy Yarnold, with two gold medals, both in the women's skeleton.\n\n\n\n\n## Eligibility[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAccording to official data of the International Olympic Committee. This is a list of people who have won at least three Olympic gold medals or four Olympic medals for Great Britain. Medals won in the 1906 Intercalated Games are not included.

He is followed by Sir Chris Hoy who won six. Kenny also has the most total medals with 9, followed by fellow cyclist Sir Bradley Wiggins who has eight. Dame Laura Kenny, with five gold medals, has the most golds of any British female athlete and became the first British woman to win gold at three consecutive Olympic Games at Tokyo 2020. She shares the designation of most total medals by a British female competitor with horse-rider Charlotte Dujardin. Sir Steve Redgrave is the only British Olympian to win a gold medal in five consecutive Olympic Games, winning his first in 1984 Los Angeles and last in 2000 Sydney.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Year\n | Climbers\n | Events\n | **Gold** | **Silver** | **Bronze** | Total\n | Rank\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2020 | 1 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | \u2013\n |\n| 2024 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| **Total** |  |  | **0** | **0** | **0** | **0** | \u2013\n |\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n### Swimming[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Swimming at the Summer Olympics\n\nGreat Britain was the third most successful team in swimming in 2008, with 2 golds, 2 silvers and 2 bronzes, with Rebecca Adlington winning two of these, making her the most successful female British swimmer in 100 years.[25]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Medal\n | Name\n | Games\n | Sport\n | Event\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Gold | George CornetCharles ForsythGeorge NevinsonPaul RadmilovicCharles SmithThomas ThouldGeorge Wilkinson | ![United Kingdom](image) 1908 London | ![](image) Water polo | Men's tournament\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Gold | Charles Sydney SmithGeorge CornetGeorge WilkinsonCharles BugbeeArthur Edwin HillPaul RadmilovicIsaac Bentham | ![Sweden](image) 1912 Stockholm | ![](image) Water polo | Men's tournament\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Gold | Charles Sydney SmithPaul RadmilovicCharles BugbeeNoel PurcellChristopher JonesWilliam PeacockWilliam Henry Dean | ![Belgium](image) 1920 Antwerp | ![](image) Water polo | Men's tournament\n |\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n### Weightlifting[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Weightlifting at the Summer Olympics\n\nGreat Britain's only gold medal in weightlifting came at the first Games in 1896, when Launceston Elliot won the one-hand lift.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAthletes from the United Kingdom, all but three of its Overseas Territories, and the three Crown Dependencies, can compete in the Olympic Games as part of **Team GB**.

Sports statistics provider Infostrada projected 57 medals, 16 of them gold. Sheffield Hallam University 56 medals, 27 of them gold; whilst Luciana Barra a former Italian Olympic Committee member, estimated 59 medals, 16 of them gold.[13]\n\n\nUK Sport set targets for medals and positions for each individual Olympic sports except Football.

The women's +87\u00a0kg weightlifting event was technically a new event, but was in reality simply an adjusted version of the existing super-heavyweight class. Nonetheless, Emily Campbell's silver medal was the first ever won in weightlifting by a British woman, the first British weightlifting medal for either sex since 1984 and the first at a non-boycotted Games since Louis Martin medalled in consecutive Olympics in 1960 and 1964. Indeed, the weightlifting event at the Games was a significant success for Great Britain, with top-seven finishes for all four selected lifters, and Sarah Davies coming agonisingly close to winning a second silver medal in the \u221264\u00a0kg class.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe 2020 Games saw members of the Great Britain team achieve a number of prominent milestones. In the pool, Adam Peaty became the first British swimmer to successfully defend an Olympic gold medal, winning the 100 metre breaststroke for the second time. The British swimming team also had its most successful Olympics in history winning eight medals (with four golds) eclipsing the previous Olympic swimming best of seven medals (which also included four golds) which had stood since the London 1908 Games (113 years). This included a 1\u20132 finish in the final of the Men's 200m freestyle for Duncan Scott (who took silver) and Tom Dean (who took gold) which was the first time British swimmers had achieved this in any Olympic swimming event since 1908. Scott also became Britain's most successful athlete in any sport at a single games in terms of number of medals won with four medals in total made up of one gold and three silver medals. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Medals by date\n |\n| --- |\n| **Day** | **Date** | ![1st place, gold medalist(s)](image) | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) | ![3rd place, bronze medalist(s)](image) | **Total** |\n| 1\n | 24 Jul\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | **0** |\n| 2\n | 25 Jul\n | 0\n | 1\n | 1\n | **2** |\n| 3\n | 26 Jul\n | 3\n | 2\n | 0\n | **5** |\n| 4\n | 27 Jul\n | 1\n | 2\n | 3\n | **6** |\n| 5\n | 28 Jul\n | 1\n | 1\n | 1\n | **3** |\n| 6\n | 29 Jul\n | 0\n | 1\n | 1\n | **2** |\n| 7\n | 30 Jul\n | 1\n | 2\n | 3\n | **6** |\n| 8\n | 31 Jul\n | 2\n | 0\n | 2\n | **4** |\n| 9\n | 1 Aug\n | 2\n | 1\n | 1\n | **4** |\n| 10\n | 2 Aug\n | 1\n | 2\n | 0\n | **3** |\n| 11\n | 3 Aug\n | 2\n | 5\n | 1\n | **8** |\n| 12\n | 4 Aug\n | 2\n | 1\n | 2\n | **5** |\n| 13\n | 5 Aug\n | 1\n | 0\n | 2\n | **3** |\n| 14\n | 6 Aug\n | 2\n | 1\n | 3\n | **6** |\n| 15\n | 7 Aug\n | 2\n | 1\n | 2\n | **5** |\n| 16\n | 8 Aug\n | 2\n | 0\n | 0\n | **2** |\n| Total\n | 22\n | 20\n | 22\n | 64\n |\n\n\n |\n\n### Multiple medallists[edit]\n\n\nThe following Team GB competitors won multiple medals at the 2020 Olympic Games.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGreat Britain, or in full Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the team of the British Olympic Association (BOA), which represents the United Kingdom, competed at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. Originally scheduled to take place from 24 July to 9 August 2020, the Games were postponed to 23 July to 8 August 2021, because of the COVID-19 pandemic.[3]\n\n\nBritish athletes have appeared in every Summer Olympic Games of the modern era, alongside those of Australia, France, Greece, and Switzerland, although Great Britain is the only team to have won at least one gold medal at all of them. This streak was maintained in Tokyo when Adam Peaty successfully defended his 100 metre breaststroke title on the third morning of the Games.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn a less positive note a number of iconic 'streaks' of British success were broken. The men's team pursuit title left British hands for the first time since 2004, as did the men's team sprint with both Ed Clancy and Jason Kenny denied fourth consecutive gold medals in the same event. The men's match sprint in cycling also left British hands for the first time since 2004, although Jack Carlin won a bronze medal. The men's coxless four lost the Olympic title for the first time since 1996, while the rowing team \u2013 having been the only British sporting team during the disastrous Great Britain at the 1996 Summer Olympics to have won gold, and thus maintained Great Britain's streak of at least one gold medal in every Summer Games \u2013 won no gold medals for the first time since 1980 winning only 2 medals in total across the whole Olympic rowing regatta.\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

In the same year, when the Soviet representative Konstantin Andrianov became an IOC member, the USSR officially joined the Olympic Movement.\n\n\nThe 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki thus became first Olympic Games for Soviet athletes. On July 20, 1952 Nina Romashkova won the first Olympic gold medal in the history of Soviet sport, competing in the women's discus throw.

All Soviet athletes held some nominal jobs, but were in fact state-sponsored and trained full-time. According to many experts, that gave the Soviet Union a huge advantage over the United States and other Western countries, whose athletes were students or real amateurs.[4][5] Indeed, the Soviet Union monopolized the top place in the medal standings after 1968, and, until its collapse, placed second only once, in the 1984 Winter games, after another Eastern bloc nation, the GDR. Amateur rules were relaxed only in the late 1980s and were almost completely abolished in the 1990s, after the fall of the USSR.[6][7]\n\n\n\n### Doping[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n8. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Hunt, Thomas M.

Only one of these cases concerns a medal. A gold medal that is officially added to France's total is given to Luxembourg.[4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGermany has competed under five different designations, including as two separate teams at several Games. Sources vary in how they present the medals won by these teams. The table below shows sourced combinations of these teams, when applied to the updated medal totals from the main table. A part of Germany, Saar, competed independently in the Summer Olympic games in 1952, but failed to win any medals. Due to most lists only listing medal counts, it's possible but not certain Saar was included as part of Germany in their calculations. Germany was denied participation on three occasions (1920, 1924, and 1948).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Date | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1896\u20131912 | **![German Empire](image) Germany (GER)** |\n| 1920\u20131924 | *denied participation* |\n| 1928\u20131936 | **![Weimar Republic](image)\u00a0![Nazi Germany](image) Germany (GER)** |\n| 1948 | *denied participation* |\n| 1952 | ![](image)\u00a0Saar\u00a0(SAA) | ![](image)\u00a0Germany\u00a0(GER) |\n| 1956\u20131964 | ![](image)\u00a0United Team of Germany\u00a0(EUA) |\n| 1968\u20131988 | ![](image)\u00a0West Germany\u00a0(FRG) | ![](image)\u00a0East Germany\u00a0(GDR) |\n| 1992\u2013 | **![](image)\u00a0Germany\u00a0(GER)** |\n\n\n**Medal counts:**  \n\n*status after the 2022 Olympics*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe all-time medal table for all Olympic Games from 1896 to 2022, including Summer Olympic Games, Winter Olympic Games, and a combined total of both, is tabulated below. These Olympic medal counts do not include the 1906 Intercalated Games which are no longer recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) as official Games.\nThe IOC itself does not publish all-time tables, and publishes unofficial tables only per single Games. This table was thus compiled by adding up single entries from the IOC database.[1]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe table is pre-sorted by the name of each Olympic Committee, but can be displayed as sorted by any other column, such as the total number of gold medals or total number of overall medals. To sort by gold, silver, and then bronze, sort first by the bronze column, then the silver, and then the gold. The table does not count revoked medals (e.g., due to doping).\n\n\nA total of 156 current and historical NOCs have earned at least one medal. Medal totals in this table are current through the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, People's Republic of China, and all changes in medal standings due to doping cases and medal redistributions up to 5 May 2023 are taken into account.\n\n\n\nSpecial delegation, not an actual nation\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* All-time Paralympic Games medal table\n* All-time Youth Olympic Games medal table\n* Olympic medal table\n* List of first Olympic gold medalists by country\n* List of participating nations at the Summer Olympic Games\n* List of participating nations at the Winter Olympic Games\n* List of multiple Olympic gold medalists\n* List of multiple Olympic gold medalists at a single Games\n* List of multiple Olympic gold medalists in one event\n* List of multiple Olympic medalists\n* List of multiple Olympic medalists at a single Games\n* List of multiple Olympic medalists in one event\n* List of Olympic teams by medals won\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  | Summer Games\n | Winter Games\n | Combined total\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Team (IOC code) | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Bohemia\u00a0(BOH) | 3 | 0 | 1 | 3 | 4 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 3 | 0 | 1 | 3 | 4\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Czechoslovakia\u00a0(TCH) | 16 | 49 | 49 | 45 | 143 | 16 | 2 | 8 | 15 | 25 | 32 | 51 | 57 | 60 | 168\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Czech Republic\u00a0(CZE) | 7 | 19 | 22 | 26 | 67 | 8 | 10 | 11 | 13 | 34 | 15 | 29 | 33 | 39 | 101\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Slovakia\u00a0(SVK) | 7 | 10 | 14 | 8 | 32 | 8 | 4 | 4 | 2 | 10 | 15 | 14 | 18 | 10 | 42\n |\n| Total\n | 26 | 78 | 86 | 82 | 246 | 24 | 16 | 23 | 30 | 69 | 50 | 94 | 109 | 112 | 315\n |\n\n\n### Germany[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThis article is about Olympic medals by country.

Germany has hosted three Olympic Games, in 1936 both the Winter and Summer Games, and the 1972 Summer Olympics. In addition, Germany had been selected to host the 1916 Summer Olympics as well as the 1940 Winter Olympics, both of which had to be cancelled due to World Wars. After these wars, Germany was banned from participating in the 1920, 1924 and 1948 Olympics.\n\n\nWhile the country was divided, each of the two German states boycotted one of the Summer Games. In 1980, West Germany was one of 66 nations which did not go to Moscow in protest at the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan, and in 1984 East Germany joined the Soviet Union and several others in the boycott of the Summer Games in Los Angeles. In 1990, East Germany and West Germany would reunite, with Germany once again competing as a single full sovereign state since the 1992 Olympic year.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe IOC currently splits German results among four codes, even though only the German Democratic Republic (GDR) from 1968 to 1988 had sent a separate team to compete against the team of the German NOC that represented Germany (GER) since 1896.\n\n\n\n\n## German post-WW2 division until 1990[edit]\n\n\nAfter German organisations had been dissolved by the Allies in 1947, in 1950 the IOC recognized the reorganized Nationales Olympisches Komitee f\u00fcr Deutschland for all of Germany, based in (West) Germany.\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
