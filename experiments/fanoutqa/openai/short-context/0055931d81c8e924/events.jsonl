Much like with other novels in the series, *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets* triggered religious debates; some religious authorities have condemned its use of magical themes, whereas others have praised its emphasis on self-sacrifice and the way one's character is the result of one's choices.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n*Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets* was published in the UK on 2 July 1998 and in the US on 2 June 1999.[4][5] It immediately took first place in UK bestseller lists, displacing popular authors such as John Grisham, Tom Clancy[1] and Terry Pratchett,[6] and making Rowling the first author to win the British Book Awards Children's Book of the Year for two years in succession.[7] In June 1999, it went straight to the top of three US bestseller lists,[8] including in *The New York Times*.[9]\n\n\nFirst edition printings had several errors, which were fixed in subsequent reprints.[10] Initially, Dumbledore said Voldemort was the last remaining ancestor of Salazar Slytherin instead of his descendant.[10] Gilderoy Lockhart's book on werewolves is entitled *Weekends with Werewolves* at one point and *Wanderings with Werewolves* later in the book.[11]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n1998 fantasy novel by J.

One evening, Dementors attack him and cousin Dudley, but Harry fends them off using the Patronus Charm. Later, Order of the Phoenix members arrive at the Dursley house to evacuate Harry. They whisk him off to Number 12, Grimmauld Place, Sirius Black's family home, which is now the Order's headquarters. Ron and Hermione are there and tell Harry that the Order is a secret organisation that Dumbledore created to fight Voldemort and the Death Eaters. Harry wants to join but is still too young. \n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_Lnb2fpcEb5tkwrtHttjstjpN","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

The first novel in the *Harry Potter* series and Rowling's debut novel, it follows Harry Potter, a young wizard who discovers his magical heritage on his eleventh birthday, when he receives a letter of acceptance to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry makes close friends and a few enemies during his first year at the school and with the help of his friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, he faces an attempted comeback by the dark wizard Lord Voldemort, who killed Harry's parents, but failed to kill Harry when he was just 15 months old.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* ![](image) Quotations related to *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone* at Wikiquote\n* Background information and storylines from the Harry Potter Lexicon\n* *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone* title listing at the Internet Speculative Fiction Database\n* Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone at Open Library ![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n*Harry Potter* by J.

(The 1998 first American edition would remove reference to \"Joanne\" completely.)[18] The short initial print run was standard for first novels and Cunningham hoped booksellers would read the book and recommend it to customers.[14] Examples from this initial print run have sold for as much as US$471,000 in a 2021 Heritage auction.[19] Thomas Taylor created the cover for the first edition.[14]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nScholastic Corporation bought the US rights at the Bologna Book Fair in April 1997 for US$105,000, an unusually high sum for a children's book.[14] Scholastic's Arthur Levine thought that \"philosopher\" sounded too archaic for readers[31] and after some discussion (including the proposed title \"Harry Potter and the School of Magic\"[32]), the American edition was published in September 1998[33] under the title Rowling suggested, *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone*.[14] Rowling later said that she regretted this change and would have fought it if she had been in a stronger position at the time.[10] Philip Nel has pointed out that the change lost the connection with alchemy and the meaning of some other terms changed in translation, for example from \"crumpet\" to \"muffin\". \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n86. **^** \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (Mac)\".

The first, *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*, was published by Bloomsbury on 26 June 1997. The second, *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets*, was published on 2 July 1998. The third, *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban*, followed on 8 July 1999.[1] *Goblet of Fire* is almost twice the size of the first three books (the paperback edition was 636 pages). Rowling stated that she \"knew from the beginning it would be the biggest of the first four.\" She said there needed to be a \"proper run-up\" for the conclusion and rushing the \"complex plot\" could confuse readers. She also stated that \"everything is on a bigger scale,\" which was symbolic, as Harry's horizons widened both literally and metaphorically as he grew up. She also wanted to explore more of the magical world.[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n***Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire*** is a fantasy novel written by British author J. K. Rowling and the fourth novel in the *Harry Potter* series. It follows Harry Potter, a wizard in his fourth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and the mystery surrounding the entry of Harry's name into the Triwizard Tournament, in which he is forced to compete.\n\n\nThe book was published in the United Kingdom by Bloomsbury and in the United States by Scholastic. In both countries, the release date was 8 July 2000. This was the first time a book in the series was published in both countries at the same time. The novel won a Hugo Award, the only *Harry Potter* novel to do so, in 2001.

Three million copies of the book were sold over the first weekend in the US alone.[5] FedEx dispatched more than 9,000 trucks and 100 planes to fulfil book deliveries.[6] The pressure in editing caused a mistake which shows Harry's father emerging first from Voldemort's wand; however, as confirmed in *Prisoner of Azkaban*, James died first, so then Harry's mother ought to have come out first.[7] This was corrected in later editions.[8]\n\n\n\n#### Launch publicity[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n2000 fantasy novel by J.

However, they commented that it did tend to lag, especially at the end where two \"bad guys\" stopped the action to give extended explanations, and that the issues to be resolved in sequels would leave \"many readers, particularly American ones, uncomfortable\".[14] For *The Horn Book Magazine*, Martha V. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** \"A Potter timeline for muggles\". *Toronto Star*. 14 July 2007.

The match ends in a victory for the Irish, but the campsite is attacked by Voldemort's former followers called the Death Eaters. Nobody is killed, but the Dark Mark is set off and found to have been cast by Barty Crouch's house-elf, Winky.\n\n\nHogwarts reopens and a new tournament is announced between three schools to compete for the Triwizard Cup. The other competing schools are Beauxbatons and Durmstrang. Students excitedly await the start of the Tournament, which is declared open after the visiting teams arrive. The Goblet of Fire, a magical object tasked with selecting the champions, is unveiled. It names three champions from each of the schools, then selects Harry as a fourth champion, despite him being underage.\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_IrA7cyAzTBfELE4qE3pPgndz","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

Rowling and is the third in the *Harry Potter* series. The book follows Harry Potter, a young wizard, in his third year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Along with friends Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger, Harry investigates Sirius Black, an escaped prisoner from Azkaban, the wizard prison, believed to be one of Lord Voldemort's old allies.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe film version of *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban* was released in 2004 and was directed by Alfonso Cuarón from a screenplay by Steve Kloves.[41] The film débuted at number one at the box office and held that position for two weeks.[42] It made a total of $796.7 million worldwide,[43] which made it the second highest-grossing film of 2004 behind *Shrek 2*. However, among all eight entries in the *Harry Potter* franchise, *Prisoner of Azkaban* grossed the lowest; yet among critics and fans, the film is often cited as the best in the franchise – in large part due to Cuarón's stylistic influence.[44][45] The film ranks at number 471 in *Empire* magazine's 2008 list of the 500 greatest movies of all time.[46]\n\n\n\n### Video games[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game)\n\nThree unique video games by different developers were released in 2004 by Electronic Arts, loosely based on the book:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAn illustrated version of *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban* was released on 3 October 2017, and was illustrated by Jim Kay, who illustrates the previous two instalments.

Rowling is working on. Harry's third year is a charm. Don't miss it.\"[11] *Kirkus Reviews* did not give a starred review but said, \"a properly pulse-pounding climax...The main characters and the continuing story both come along so smartly...that the book seems shorter than its page count: have readers clear their calendars if they are fans, or get out of the way if they are not.\"[12] Martha V. \n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_O9sLfYVPVYxQ8ygsaA2OgW8T","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
