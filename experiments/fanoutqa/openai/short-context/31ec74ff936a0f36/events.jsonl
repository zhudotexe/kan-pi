However, theatrical box-office earnings are the primary metric for trade publications in assessing the success of a film, mostly because of the availability of the data compared to sales figures for home video and broadcast rights, but also because of historical practice. Included on the list are charts of the top box-office earners (ranked by both the nominal and real value of their revenue), a chart of high-grossing films by calendar year, a timeline showing the transition of the highest-grossing film record, and a chart of the highest-grossing film franchises and series. All charts are ranked by international theatrical box-office performance where possible, excluding income derived from home video, broadcasting rights, and merchandise.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWhile inflation has eroded the achievements of most films from the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, there are franchises originating from that period that are still active. Besides the *Star Wars* and *Superman* franchises, *James Bond* and *Godzilla* films are still being released periodically; all four are among the highest-grossing franchises. Some of the older films that held the record of highest-grossing film still have respectable grosses by today's standards, but no longer compete numerically against today's top-earners in an era of much higher individual ticket prices. When those prices are adjusted for inflation, however, then *Gone with the Wind*—which was the highest-grossing film outright for twenty-five years—is still the highest-grossing film of all time. All grosses on the list are expressed in U.S. dollars at their nominal value, except where stated otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n## Highest-grossing films[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t+ \"X-Men – Worldwide (Unadjusted)\". *Box Office Mojo*.

Grosses are not limited to original theatrical runs either, with many older films often being re-released periodically so the figures represent all the business a film has done since its original release; a film's first-run gross is included in brackets after the total if known. Because of incomplete data it cannot be known for sure how much money some films have made and when they made it, but generally the chart chronicles the films from each year that went on to earn the most. In the cases where estimates conflict both films are recorded, and in cases where a film has moved into first place because of being re-released the previous record-holder is also retained.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n99. **^** Robertson, Patrick (1991). *Guinness Book of Movie Facts and Feats* (4 ed.).

Amblin Entertainment and Touchstone Pictures placed the actual expenditure on the film itself at around $50 million,[226] but it is not clear if the figures for the other films on the list include or exclude the overhead. Interest payments on the budget came to $17,105,000 which brought the full financial commitment on production to over $75 million.[225]\n44. ^ ***a*** ***b*** 20th Century Fox put the official budget of James Cameron's *The Abyss* (1989) at $43 million;[229] however, some estimates place the true cost as high as $70 million, which would have made it the most expensive film made up to that point.[230]\n45. **^** Estimates put the budget for *True Lies* between $100 million[237][238] and $120 million,[114] but either way it was still the first film to cost over $100 million.[236]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMost expensive back-to-back film productions\n| Rank\n | Titles\n | Years\n | Cost (est.)(millions) | Refs and notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | *Avengers: Infinity War*  *Avengers: Endgame* | 2018–19\n | $1,000\n | [72][nb 5] |\n| 2\n | *The Hobbit* trilogy | 2012–14\n | \\*$623\n | [73][nb 31] |\n| 3\n | *Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest*  *Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End* | 2006–07\n | $450\n | [74][nb 7] |\n| 4\n | *The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1* and *Part 2* | 2014–15\n | $300\n | [75] |\n| 5\n | *The Lord of the Rings* trilogy | 2001–03\n | \\*$260\n | [76][77][nb 32] |\n| 6\n | *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1* and *Part 2* | 2010–11\n | $250\n | [78][79] |\n| 7\n | *The Matrix Reloaded*  *The Matrix Revolutions* | 2003\n | $237\n | [nb 33] |\n| 8\n | *The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 1* and *Part 2* | 2011–12\n | \\*$230\n | [nb 34] |\n\n\n\\*Officially acknowledged figure.\n\n## Most expensive films (adjusted for inflation)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTimeline of the most expensive million dollar films\n| Year\n | Production\n | Cost (est.)(millions) | Refs and notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1922\n | *Foolish Wives* | $1.104\n | [114] |\n| 1922\n | *When Knighthood Was in Flower* | $1.5\n | [212] |\n| 1923\n | *The Ten Commandments* | \\*$1.476\n | [219] |\n| 1925\n | *Ben-Hur* | $3.967\n | [220][221] |\n| 1939\n | *Gone with the Wind* | $3.9–4.25\n | [139] |\n| 1946\n | *Duel in the Sun* | $5.255\n | [139] |\n| 1947\n | *Forever Amber* | $6.375\n | [139] |\n| 1951\n | *Quo Vadis* | $7.623\n | [139] |\n| 1956\n | *The Ten Commandments* | \\*$13.272\n | [219] |\n| 1959\n | *Ben-Hur* | $15.175\n | [139] |\n| 1962\n | *Mutiny on the Bounty* | $19\n | [222][223] |\n| 1963\n | *Cleopatra* | \\*$31.115\n | [139][nb 38] |\n| 1978\n | *Superman* | $55\n | [210][211] |\n| 1988\n | *Rambo III* | $58–63\n | [139][224] |\n| *Who Framed Roger Rabbit* | $58.166\n | [225][nb 43] |\n| 1990\n | *Total Recall* | $50–60\n | [227][228][nb 44] |\n| *Die Hard 2* | $62–70\n | [231][226][nb 44] |\n| 1991\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTimeline of the most expensive back-to-back film productions\n| Year\n | Production\n | Cost (est.)(millions) | Refs and notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1990\n | *Back to the Future Part II* and *Part III* (1989–1990)\n | †$80\n | [244] |\n| 2003\n | *The Matrix Reloaded*  *The Matrix Revolutions* | †$237\n | [nb 33] |\n| *The Lord of the Rings* trilogy (2001–2003)\n | \\*†$260\n | [76][77][nb 32] |\n| 2007\n | *Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest* (2006)  *Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End* (2007)\n | †$450\n | [74][nb 7] |\n| 2014\n | *The Hobbit* trilogy (2012–2014)\n | †\\*$623\n | [73][nb 31] |\n| 2019\n | *Avengers: Infinity War* (2018)  *Avengers: Endgame* (2019)\n | $1,000\n | [72][nb 5] |\n\n\n\\* Officially acknowledged figure.\n† The figure given is the cost of a multi-film production, where the films are produced simultaneously.\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Film finance\n* List of biggest box-office bombs\n* List of highest-grossing films\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe productions listed here have their nominal budgets adjusted for inflation using the United States Consumer Price Index[83] taking the year of release.
