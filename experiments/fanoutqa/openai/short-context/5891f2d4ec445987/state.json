Ronaldo has also finished as the top scorer for the most individual seasons in the competition's history, doing so seven times.\n\n\nThe title of highest goalscorer had previously been held by Ra\u00fal, who scored his 50th goal in 2005 while at Real Madrid to overtake Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano.[1] He held the record until November 2014,[2][3] when his eventual tally of 71 was first equalled and then surpassed by Messi.[4][5] Ronaldo has remained the competition's outright top scorer since September 2015; after a back-and-forth exchange of the record between him and Messi, a hat-trick by the former against Shakhtar Donetsk put Ronaldo ahead with 80 goals, and he would not relinquish the top spot again after this.[6]\n\n\n\n\n## All-time top scorers[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* List of footballers with 100 or more UEFA Champions League appearances\n* List of UEFA Champions League hat-tricks\n* List of UEFA Cup and Europa League top scorers\n* List of UEFA Cup Winners' Cup top scorers\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Cristiano Ronaldo is the competition's all-time top scorer with 140 goals\nThe **UEFA Champions League**, known until 1992 as the **European Champion Clubs' Cup** or colloquially as the **European Cup**, is an annual association football cup competition organised by UEFA since 1955. Originally a straight knockout competition open only to champion clubs, the tournament was expanded during the 1990s to incorporate a round-robin group phase and more teams. The expansion resulted in more games being played, increasing players' goalscoring chances; thus the rankings are weighted in favour of modern players: only seven out of the 52 players on the list never competed in the reformed Champions League.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nEuropean Cup and UEFA Champions League top scorers\n |\n| --- |\n| European Cup era | * 1956: Milutinovi\u0107\n* 1957: Viollet\n* 1958: Di St\u00e9fano\n* 1959: Fontaine\n* 1960: Pusk\u00e1s\n* 1961: J. \u00c1guas\n* 1962: Di St\u00e9fano, L\u00f8fqvist, Pusk\u00e1s, Strehl & Tejada\n* 1963: Altafini\n* 1964: Kova\u010devi\u0107, Mazzola & Pusk\u00e1s\n* 1965: Eus\u00e9bio & Torres\n* 1966: Albert & Eus\u00e9bio\n* 1967: Piepenburg & Van Himst\n* 1968: Eus\u00e9bio\n* 1969: Law\n* 1970: Jones\n* 1971: Antoniadis\n* 1972: Dunai, Macari & Taka\u010d\n* 1973: M\u00fcller\n* 1974: M\u00fcller\n* 1975: Markarov & M\u00fcller\n* 1976: Heynckes\n* 1977: Cucinotta & M\u00fcller\n* 1978: Simonsen\n* 1979: Sulser\n* 1980: Lerby\n* 1981: McDermott, Rummenigge & Souness\n* 1982: Hoene\u00df\n* 1983: Rossi\n* 1984: Sokol\n* 1985: Nilsson & Platini\n* 1986: Nilsson\n* 1987: Cvetkovi\u0107\n* 1988: R. \u00c1guas, Ferreri, Hagi, Madjer, McCoist, M\u00edchel & Nov\u00e1k\n* 1989: Van Basten\n* 1990: Papin & Rom\u00e1rio\n* 1991: Pacult & Papin\n* 1992: Papin & Yuran\n |\n| UEFA Champions League era | * 1993: Rom\u00e1rio\n* 1994: Koeman & Rufer\n* 1995: Weah\n* 1996: Litmanen\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Ra\u00fal ya es el m\u00e1ximo goleador de la Copa de Europa\" [Ra\u00fal is now the top scorer of the European Cup]. *Diario AS* (in Spanish).

It was scored in the 50th minute after Ra\u00fal (himself only on the pitch as a substitute for Rafael van der Vaart after 15 minutes) had signalled he could not physically continue and was prepared to be substituted off for Karim Benzema one minute after the goal.[29] Before the substitution could be made, Real Madrid launched a counter-attack to create a goal. Though Ra\u00fal ran to a slow hobble, he shuffled into the box and was able to poke the ball from Cristiano Ronaldo's pass.\n\n\nHaving spent the rest of the season recovering from that injury, the club confirmed on 25 July 2010 that Ra\u00fal would be leaving the club, a day after his teammate Guti confirmed he was also leaving after a 15-year spell.[30]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Ra\u00fal in his last match with Real Madrid against Real Zaragoza\n![](image)Raul gets substituted by Cristiano Ronaldo, who would eventually inherit the number 7 jersey\nRa\u00fal and fellow long-serving teammate Iker Casillas were both awarded \"contracts for life\" in 2008, the terms of which stipulated that the contracts would be renewed annually for as long as they played 30 matches each season.[26] On 23 September 2009, Ra\u00fal equalled Manolo Sanch\u00eds' league appearance record for Real Madrid,[27] and is second in La Liga behind Andoni Zubizarreta, who played in 622 matches.\n\n\nAlong with years of captaincy for both Real Madrid and Spain, Ra\u00fal was known as \"*El Capitan*\" (\"The Captain\").[28]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRa\u00fal was born in the San Crist\u00f3bal de los \u00c1ngeles neighborhood of Madrid where he played for the local youth team before moving to the Atl\u00e9tico Madrid youth team. He later moved to Real Madrid's youth academy and played at its various levels. In 1994, he signed his first professional contract with the fourth division team Real Madrid C, and then was swiftly promoted to the first team.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRa\u00fal was named the top international goalscorer in the world by International Federation of Football History & Statistics in 1999, and ranked second in the 2001 Ballon d'Or and third in the 2001 FIFA World Player of the Year.[10] In 2004, he was named in the FIFA 100 list of the world's greatest living players, and was included in the UEFA list of the 50-best European players of the 1954\u20132004 period. He was part of the European Team of the Year of European Sports Media in 1997, 1999 and 2000.[11] Ra\u00fal won two Pichichi trophies (1999 and 2001), the top goalscorer award of the UEFA Champions League (2000 and 2001), five Don Bal\u00f3n Awards (1997, 1999, 2000, 2001 and 2002) and one Best Player Award at the Intercontinental Cup in 1998.\n\n\n\n\n## Club career[edit]\n\n\n### Youth clubs[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMain article: List of international goals scored by Ra\u00fal\n\n\n\nAppearances and goals by national team and year[98]\n| National team\n | Year\n | Apps\n | Goals\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Spain | 1996 | 4 | 1\n |\n| 1997 | 6 | 0\n |\n| 1998 | 10 | 4\n |\n| 1999 | 9 | 10\n |\n| 2000 | 11 | 3\n |\n| 2001 | 9 | 5\n |\n| 2002 | 9 | 6\n |\n| 2003 | 10 | 8\n |\n| 2004 | 13 | 3\n |\n| 2005 | 12 | 2\n |\n| 2006 | 9 | 2\n |\n| Total | 102 | 44\n |\n\n\n## Managerial statistics[edit]\n\n\n*As of 3 September 2023*\n\n\nManagerial record by team and tenure\n| Team\n | From\n | To\n | Record\n | Ref |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| G | W | D | L | GF | GA | GD | Win\u00a0% |\n| Real Madrid Castilla | 20 June 2019\n | *Present* | 135 | 58 | 41 | 36 | 219 | 162 | +57\n | 042.96 | [99] |\n| Real Madrid U19 (caretaker)\n | 1 July 2020\n | 31 August 2020\n | 4 | 4 | 0 | 0 | 11 | 4 | +7\n | 100.00 |  |\n| Total\n | 139 | 62 | 41 | 36 | 230 | 166 | +64\n | 044.60 | \u2014\n |\n\n\n## Honours[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ra\u00fal in his last season with Real Madrid\n### Player[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRa\u00fal holds the distinction of having never been sent off in his 17 years at the professional level.[23] On 11 November 2008, Ra\u00fal scored his 300th goal for Real Madrid with a hat-trick against Real Uni\u00f3n, with Real winning the match 4\u20133 but being eliminated on away goals after drawing 6\u20136 on aggregate.[24] In total, Ra\u00fal scored 323 goals for Real Madrid, breaking the long-standing club record of Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano (307) with a volleyed goal against Sporting de Gij\u00f3n on 15 February 2009. He is presently fifth on the all-time list of La Liga goalscorers, behind Argentine Lionel Messi, Portuguese Cristiano Ronaldo, Spaniard Telmo Zarra and Mexican Hugo S\u00e1nchez.[25]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRa\u00fal earned his 89th cap on 8 October 2005 in a 2\u20130 away win over Belgium in 2006 World Cup qualifying, levelling with Hierro as Spain's most-capped outfield player.[68] However, he played less frequently across the campaign as new manager Luis Aragon\u00e9s preferred to partner David Villa and Fernando Torres.\n\n\nAt the final tournament in Germany, he came on at half-time for Luis Garc\u00eda in the second group match in Stuttgart, with Spain trailing Tunisia 0\u20131. When goalkeeper Ali Boumnijel could not retain Cesc F\u00e0bregas' shot in the 72nd minute, Ra\u00fal equalised from close range as Spain eventually won 3\u20131.[69]\n\n\nOn 15 August 2006, Ra\u00fal won his 100th cap for Spain, in a goalless friendly draw with Iceland in Reykjav\u00edk.[70] He was last chosen for the national team on 6 September, in a 3\u20132 defeat against Northern Ireland in Belfast, a match in which he hit the post late on.[71]\n\n\n\n## Managerial career[edit]\n\n\n### Real Madrid U15s[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRa\u00fal is the sixth-highest goalscorer in the history of La Liga with 228 goals. He is also the highest Spanish scorer in European leagues, with 256 goals, scoring 228 goals in La Liga and 28 goals in the Bundesliga. He also has the third-most appearances in the history of La Liga, 550 matches. He is the fifth highest goalscorer in Champions League history with 71 goals, and has played the fifth most games. He has also played 1,000 matches in his career,[8] one of only 18 players to have done so.[9]\n\n\nAlthough he did not win any major competitions while playing for the Spain national team, he scored a then-record 44 goals in 102 appearances for *la Roja*, appearing in three FIFA World Cups and two European championships. Ra\u00fal took over the captaincy of the side in 2002 and held it until 2006, the year in which he played his last international match.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 22 August 2013, Ra\u00fal played for Real Madrid in the first half of the Trofeo Santiago Bernab\u00e9u and scored the first goal. He then played the second half for Al Sadd as Real Madrid won 5\u20130.[48] On 5 March 2014, Ra\u00fal announced he would retire from professional football at the end of the Qatari football season.[49]\n\n\n\n### New York Cosmos[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ra\u00fal walks onto the pitch as a member of the New York Cosmos for a home game in 2015\nOn 30 October 2014, Ra\u00fal returned to professional football and signed with the New York Cosmos in the United States.[50] He made his North American Soccer League (NASL) debut on 4 April 2015 in a 1\u20130 win against the Fort Lauderdale Strikers, partially owned by his former Real Madrid strike partner Ronaldo, leaving with a hamstring injury in the second half.[51] The following week, at the Indy Eleven, he scored his first goal to equalise in a 1\u20131 draw.[52] Ra\u00fal scored four times as the undefeated Cosmos won the spring season with five wins and five draws.[53]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRa\u00fal has been sponsored by German sportswear company Adidas during his career and has appeared in Adidas commercials.[90] He has advertised Adidas Predator football boots, and in 2004 he starred in an Adidas commercial featuring a number of other stars on mopeds, including Zinedine Zidane, Michael Ballack, Alessandro Del Piero and David Trezeguet.[90]\n\n\nRa\u00fal has featured in Pepsi commercials, including an advertisement for the 2002 World Cup in Korea and Japan where he lined up alongside players including David Beckham, Roberto Carlos and Gianluigi Buffon in taking on a team of Sumo players.[91]\n\n\nRa\u00fal features in EA Sports' *FIFA* video game series. His regular goal celebration of kissing the ring finger \u2013 a show of affection to his wife \u2013 appears in *FIFA 18*; due to this celebration style, he is also nicknamed \"*Lord of the Rings*\", which received from the famous fantasy series of J. R. R. Tolkien.[92][93]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRa\u00fal's career began at his local team CD San Crist\u00f3bal de los \u00c1ngeles playing for their *Alev\u00edn* team and the *Infantil* the next season.[12][13] He signed with Atl\u00e9tico Madrid's *Infantil* team and won a national title with the *Cadete* team the following season. Following Atl\u00e9tico's then-president Jes\u00fas Gil decision to close their youth academy as a cost-saving measure, Ra\u00fal moved on to Real Madrid's *Cadete* team in La F\u00e1brica. The following season, he was promoted to the *Juvenil C* team and subsequently went on to play for their *Juvenil B* and *Juvenil A* team.[14] While with the Real youth set-up, Ra\u00fal won the Dallas Cup in 1993 and 1994.[15]\n\n\n\n### Real Madrid[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRa\u00fal earned his first senior cap against the Czech Republic on 9 October 1996, playing the full 90 minutes of a goalless draw in 1998 FIFA World Cup qualification at the Letn\u00e1 Stadion in Prague. In his third match, on 14 December against Yugoslavia at the Mestalla Stadium, he recorded his first international goal in a 2\u20130 qualifying win. At the final tournament in France, Ra\u00fal featured in every match as Spain were eliminated from Group D. He scored in their opening match to put them 2\u20131 up in an eventual 2\u20133 loss to Nigeria in Nantes.[57]\n\n\n\n### UEFA Euro 2000[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
