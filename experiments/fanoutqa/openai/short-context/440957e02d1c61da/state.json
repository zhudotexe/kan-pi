According to Statistics Canada, 72.0 percent of the population is concentrated within 150 kilometres (93\u00a0mi) of the nation's southern border with the United States, 70.0% live south of the 49th parallel, and over 60 percent of the population lives along the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River between Windsor, Ontario, and Quebec City. This leaves the vast majority of Canada's territory as sparsely populated wilderness; Canada's population density is 3.5 people\u00a0per square kilometre (9.1 people/sq\u00a0mi), among the lowest in the world. Despite this, 79.7 percent of Canada's population resides in urban areas, where population densities are increasing.[75]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n75. **^** Canada, Government of Canada, Statistics (15 January 2001). \"Population, urban and rural, by province and territory (Canada)\". *www.statcan.gc.ca*.

By land area only (exclusive of waters), the United States is the world's third largest country, after Russia and China, with Canada in fourth. Whether the US or China is the third largest country by total area depends on two factors: (1) the validity of China's claim on Aksai Chin and Trans-Karakoram Tract (both these territories are also claimed by India, so are not counted); and (2) how the US calculates its surface area. Since the initial publishing of the World Factbook, the CIA has updated the total area of the United States several times.[10]\n\n\n\n## General characteristics[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Borders of the United States\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n7. **^** \"United States\". *The World Factbook*.
