John Bardeen is the only laureate to win the prize twice—in 1956 and 1972.\n\n\nWilliam Lawrence Bragg was the youngest Nobel laureate in physics; he won the prize in 1915 at the age of 25. He was also the youngest laureate for any Nobel prize until 2014 (when Malala Yousafzai won the Nobel Peace Prize at age 17).[6] The oldest Nobel Prize laureate in physics was Arthur Ashkin who was 96 years old when he was awarded the prize in 2018.[7]\n\n\nOnly five women have won the prize: Marie Curie (1903), Maria Goeppert-Mayer (1963), Donna Strickland (2018), Andrea Ghez (2020), and Anne L'Huillier (2023).[8] Before L'Huillier, each woman only ever received a quarter share of the prize, although Marie Curie did receive an unshared Nobel prize in chemistry in 1911. In 2023 L'Huillier received a one-third share.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIoannidis *et al.* reported that half of the Nobel Prize for science awarded between 1995 and 2017 are clustered in few disciplines. Particle physics (14%), atomic physics (10.9%), and 3 non-physics disciplines are dominating the prize in recent decades. And then semiconductor physics and magnetics are the next most honoured physics disciplines.[18]\n\n\n\n## Laureates[edit]\n\n\n* 1901\n* 1910\n* 1920\n* 1930\n* 1940\n* 1950\n* 1960\n* 1970\n* 1980\n* 1990\n* 2000\n* 2010\n* 2020\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n20. **^** \"The Nobel Prize in Physics 1902\".

John Bardeen is the only laureate to win the prize twice—in 1956 and 1972.\n\n\nWilliam Lawrence Bragg was the youngest Nobel laureate in physics; he won the prize in 1915 at the age of 25. He was also the youngest laureate for any Nobel prize until 2014 (when Malala Yousafzai won the Nobel Peace Prize at age 17).[6] The oldest Nobel Prize laureate in physics was Arthur Ashkin who was 96 years old when he was awarded the prize in 2018.[7]\n\n\nOnly five women have won the prize: Marie Curie (1903), Maria Goeppert-Mayer (1963), Donna Strickland (2018), Andrea Ghez (2020), and Anne L'Huillier (2023).[8] Before L'Huillier, each woman only ever received a quarter share of the prize, although Marie Curie did receive an unshared Nobel prize in chemistry in 1911. In 2023 L'Huillier received a one-third share.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n83. **^** \"The Nobel Prize in Physics 1979\". Nobel Foundation. Archived from the original on 26 February 2009.

John Bardeen is the only laureate to win the prize twice—in 1956 and 1972.\n\n\nWilliam Lawrence Bragg was the youngest Nobel laureate in physics; he won the prize in 1915 at the age of 25. He was also the youngest laureate for any Nobel prize until 2014 (when Malala Yousafzai won the Nobel Peace Prize at age 17).[6] The oldest Nobel Prize laureate in physics was Arthur Ashkin who was 96 years old when he was awarded the prize in 2018.[7]\n\n\nOnly five women have won the prize: Marie Curie (1903), Maria Goeppert-Mayer (1963), Donna Strickland (2018), Andrea Ghez (2020), and Anne L'Huillier (2023).[8] Before L'Huillier, each woman only ever received a quarter share of the prize, although Marie Curie did receive an unshared Nobel prize in chemistry in 1911. In 2023 L'Huillier received a one-third share.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n104. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"The Nobel Prize in Physics 2000\". Nobel Foundation.

John Bardeen is the only laureate to win the prize twice—in 1956 and 1972.\n\n\nWilliam Lawrence Bragg was the youngest Nobel laureate in physics; he won the prize in 1915 at the age of 25. He was also the youngest laureate for any Nobel prize until 2014 (when Malala Yousafzai won the Nobel Peace Prize at age 17).[6] The oldest Nobel Prize laureate in physics was Arthur Ashkin who was 96 years old when he was awarded the prize in 2018.[7]\n\n\nOnly five women have won the prize: Marie Curie (1903), Maria Goeppert-Mayer (1963), Donna Strickland (2018), Andrea Ghez (2020), and Anne L'Huillier (2023).[8] Before L'Huillier, each woman only ever received a quarter share of the prize, although Marie Curie did receive an unshared Nobel prize in chemistry in 1911. In 2023 L'Huillier received a one-third share.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n7. **^** \"Facts on the Nobel Prize in Physics\". The Nobel Foundation. 6 October 2022.

During the first stage that begins in September, a group of about 3,000 selected university professors, Nobel Laureates in Physics and Chemistry, and others are sent confidential nomination forms. The completed forms must arrive at the Nobel Committee by 31 January of the following year. The nominees are scrutinized and discussed by experts and are narrowed to approximately fifteen names. The committee submits a report with recommendations on the final candidates to the Academy, where, in the Physics Class, it is further discussed. The Academy then makes the final selection of the Laureates in Physics by a majority vote.[14]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe rules for the Nobel Prize in Physics require that the significance of achievements being recognized has been \"tested by time\". In practice, that means that the lag between the discovery and the award is typically on the order of 20 years and can be much longer. For example, half of the 1983 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar for his work on stellar structure and evolution that was done during the 1930s. As a downside of this tested-by-time rule, not all scientists live long enough for their work to be recognized. Some important scientific discoveries are never considered for a prize, as the discoverers die by the time the impact of their work is appreciated.[17][18]\n\n\n\n## Prizes[edit]\n\n\nA Physics Nobel Prize laureate is awarded a gold medal, a diploma bearing a citation, and a sum of money.[19]\n\n\n\n### Medals[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Nobel Prize medal § Physics and Chemistry\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Wilhelm Röntgen (1845–1923), the first recipient of the Nobel Prize in Physics\nThe **Nobel Prize in Physics** (Swedish: *Nobelpriset i fysik*) is a yearly award given by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences for those who have made the most outstanding contributions for humankind in the field of physics. It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the will of Alfred Nobel in 1895 and awarded since 1901, the others being the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, Nobel Prize in Literature, Nobel Peace Prize, and Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Physics is traditionally the first award presented in the Nobel Prize ceremony.\n\n\nThe prize consists of a medal along with a diploma and a certificate for the monetary award. The front side of the medal displays the same profile of Alfred Nobel depicted on the medals for Physics, Chemistry, and Literature.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* 2019: Peebles / Mayor / Queloz\n* 2020: Penrose / Genzel / Ghez\n* 2021: Parisi / Hasselmann / Manabe\n* 2022: Aspect / Clauser / Zeilinger\n* 2023: Agostini / Krausz / L'Huillier\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nNobel Prizes\n |\n| --- |\n| * Lists of Nobel laureates\n* Nobel Prize medal\n |\n| Prizes | * Chemistry\n* Economics1\n* Literature\n* Peace\n* Physics\n* Physiology or Medicine\n | ![](image)\n |\n| Laureates | * by occupation\n\t+ Heads of state and government\n* by year\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| by subject | * Chemistry\n* Economics1\n* Literature\n* Peace\n* Physics\n* Physiology or Medicine\n |\n| bypopulationgroup | * Bengali\n* Black\n* Christian\n* Female\n* Jewish\n* Latin American\n* Muslim\n* Non-religious\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Friedman, Robert Marc (2001). *The Politics of Excellence: Behind the Nobel Prize in Science*.

John Bardeen is the only laureate to win the prize twice—in 1956 and 1972.\n\n\nWilliam Lawrence Bragg was the youngest Nobel laureate in physics; he won the prize in 1915 at the age of 25. He was also the youngest laureate for any Nobel prize until 2014 (when Malala Yousafzai won the Nobel Peace Prize at age 17).[6] The oldest Nobel Prize laureate in physics was Arthur Ashkin who was 96 years old when he was awarded the prize in 2018.[7]\n\n\nOnly five women have won the prize: Marie Curie (1903), Maria Goeppert-Mayer (1963), Donna Strickland (2018), Andrea Ghez (2020), and Anne L'Huillier (2023).[8] Before L'Huillier, each woman only ever received a quarter share of the prize, although Marie Curie did receive an unshared Nobel prize in chemistry in 1911. In 2023 L'Huillier received a one-third share.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n48. **^** \"The Nobel Prize in Physics 1944\". Nobel Foundation. Archived from the original on 30 August 2009.

John Bardeen is the only laureate to win the prize twice—in 1956 and 1972.\n\n\nWilliam Lawrence Bragg was the youngest Nobel laureate in physics; he won the prize in 1915 at the age of 25. He was also the youngest laureate for any Nobel prize until 2014 (when Malala Yousafzai won the Nobel Peace Prize at age 17).[6] The oldest Nobel Prize laureate in physics was Arthur Ashkin who was 96 years old when he was awarded the prize in 2018.[7]\n\n\nOnly five women have won the prize: Marie Curie (1903), Maria Goeppert-Mayer (1963), Donna Strickland (2018), Andrea Ghez (2020), and Anne L'Huillier (2023).[8] Before L'Huillier, each woman only ever received a quarter share of the prize, although Marie Curie did receive an unshared Nobel prize in chemistry in 1911. In 2023 L'Huillier received a one-third share.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n55. **^** \"The Nobel Prize in Physics 1951\". Nobel Foundation. Archived from the original on 17 September 2008.

John Bardeen is the only laureate to win the prize twice—in 1956 and 1972.\n\n\nWilliam Lawrence Bragg was the youngest Nobel laureate in physics; he won the prize in 1915 at the age of 25. He was also the youngest laureate for any Nobel prize until 2014 (when Malala Yousafzai won the Nobel Peace Prize at age 17).[6] The oldest Nobel Prize laureate in physics was Arthur Ashkin who was 96 years old when he was awarded the prize in 2018.[7]\n\n\nOnly five women have won the prize: Marie Curie (1903), Maria Goeppert-Mayer (1963), Donna Strickland (2018), Andrea Ghez (2020), and Anne L'Huillier (2023).[8] Before L'Huillier, each woman only ever received a quarter share of the prize, although Marie Curie did receive an unshared Nobel prize in chemistry in 1911. In 2023 L'Huillier received a one-third share.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n125. **^** \"He is considered a U.S. citizen by Nobel Prize Committee\". *Reuters*.

During the first stage that begins in September, a group of about 3,000 selected university professors, Nobel Laureates in Physics and Chemistry, and others are sent confidential nomination forms. The completed forms must arrive at the Nobel Committee by 31 January of the following year. The nominees are scrutinized and discussed by experts and are narrowed to approximately fifteen names. The committee submits a report with recommendations on the final candidates to the Academy, where, in the Physics Class, it is further discussed. The Academy then makes the final selection of the Laureates in Physics by a majority vote.[14]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe committee and institution serving as the selection board for the prize typically announce the names of the laureates during the first week of October. The prize is then awarded at formal ceremonies held annually in Stockholm Concert Hall on 10 December, the anniversary of Nobel's death. The laureates receive a diploma, a medal and a document confirming the prize amount.[30]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of Nobel laureates in Physics\n* Fundamental Physics Prize\n* List of physics awards\n* Sakurai Prize, presented by the American Physical Society\n* Wolf Prize in Physics\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe rules for the Nobel Prize in Physics require that the significance of achievements being recognized has been \"tested by time\". In practice, that means that the lag between the discovery and the award is typically on the order of 20 years and can be much longer. For example, half of the 1983 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar for his work on stellar structure and evolution that was done during the 1930s. As a downside of this tested-by-time rule, not all scientists live long enough for their work to be recognized. Some important scientific discoveries are never considered for a prize, as the discoverers die by the time the impact of their work is appreciated.[17][18]\n\n\n\n## Prizes[edit]\n\n\nA Physics Nobel Prize laureate is awarded a gold medal, a diploma bearing a citation, and a sum of money.[19]\n\n\n\n### Medals[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Nobel Prize medal § Physics and Chemistry\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Wilhelm Röntgen (1845–1923), the first recipient of the Nobel Prize in Physics\nThe **Nobel Prize in Physics** (Swedish: *Nobelpriset i fysik*) is a yearly award given by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences for those who have made the most outstanding contributions for humankind in the field of physics. It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the will of Alfred Nobel in 1895 and awarded since 1901, the others being the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, Nobel Prize in Literature, Nobel Peace Prize, and Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Physics is traditionally the first award presented in the Nobel Prize ceremony.\n\n\nThe prize consists of a medal along with a diploma and a certificate for the monetary award.
