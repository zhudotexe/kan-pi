Until 2016, the championship winners could compete in the following year's FIFA Confederations Cup, but were not obliged to do so.[3] From the 2020 edition onwards, the winner competes in the CONMEBOL\u2013UEFA Cup of Champions.\n\n\nThe sixteen European Championship tournaments have been won by ten national teams: Germany and Spain have each won three titles, Italy and France have won two titles, and the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, the Netherlands, Denmark, Greece and Portugal have won one title each. To date, Spain is the only team to have won consecutive titles, doing so in 2008 and 2012.\n\n\nThe most recent championship, held across Europe in 2021 (postponed from 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic), was won by Italy, who lifted their second European title after beating England in the final at Wembley Stadium in London on penalties.[4][5]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Beginnings[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n79. **^** \"Uefa to expand Euro Championship\". *BBC Sport*.

The competition is contested by UEFA members' senior men's national teams, determining the continental champion of Europe. It is the second-most watched football tournament in the world after the FIFA World Cup. The Euro 2012 final was watched by a global audience of around 300 million.[2] The competition has been held every four years since 1960, except for 2020, when it was postponed until 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe, but kept the name Euro 2020. Scheduled to be in the even-numbered year between FIFA World Cup tournaments, it was originally called the **European Nations' Cup** before changing to its current name in 1968. Since 1996, the individual events have been branded as \"**UEFA Euro [year]**\".\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nUEFA European Championship\n |\n| --- |\n| Tournaments | * France 1960\n* Spain 1964\n* Italy 1968\n* Belgium 1972\n* Yugoslavia 1976\n* Italy 1980\n* France 1984\n* West Germany 1988\n* Sweden 1992\n* England 1996\n* Belgium / Netherlands 2000\n* Portugal 2004\n* Austria / Switzerland 2008\n* Poland / Ukraine 2012\n* France 2016\n* Pan-European 2020\u2020\n* *Germany 2024*\n* *United Kingdom / Ireland 2028*\n* *Italy / Turkey 2032*\n |\n| Qualifying | * 1960\n* 1964\n* 1968\n* 1972\n* 1976\n* 1980\n* 1984\n* 1988\n* 1992\n* 1996\n* 2000\n* 2004\n* 2008\n* 2012\n* 2016\n* 2020\n* 2024\n |\n| Finals | * 1960\n* 1964\n* 1968\n* 1972\n* 1976\n* 1980\n* 1984\n* 1988\n* 1992\n* 1996\n* 2000\n* 2004\n* 2008\n* 2012\n* 2016\n* 2020\n* 2024\n |\n| Squads | * 1960\n* 1964\n* 1968\n* 1972\n* 1976\n* 1980\n* 1984\n* 1988\n* 1992\n* 1996\n* 2000\n* 2004\n* 2008\n* 2012\n* 2016\n* 2020\n* 2024\n |\n| Bids | * 2004\n* 2008\n* 2012\n* 2016\n* 2020\n* 2024\n* 2028\n* 2032\n |\n| Statistics | * 1992\n* 1996\n* 2000\n* 2004\n* 2008\n* 2012\n* 2016\n* 2020\n |\n| Broadcasting rights | * 2000\n* 2004\n* 2008\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Regulations of the UEFA European Football Championship 2018\u201320\". *UEFA.com*.

It is contested by the men's national teams of the members of the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA), the sport's European governing body, and takes place every four years. The winners of the first final were the Soviet Union, who defeated Yugoslavia 2\u20131 in Paris, after extra time. The most recent final, hosted in London in 2021, was won by Italy, who beat England 3\u20132 on penalties.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe European Championship final is the last match of the competition, and the result determines which country's team is declared European champion. As of the 2020 tournament, if after 90 minutes of regular play the score is a draw, an additional 30-minute period of play, called extra time, is added. If such a game is still tied after extra time, it is decided by penalty shoot-out. The team that wins the penalty shoot-out are then declared champions.[1] The 16 finals to-date have produced seven drawn matches, the eventual winners of which have been determined variously by replay (1968), extra time (1960, 2016), penalty shoot-out (1976, 2020) or golden goal (1996, 2000).[2] The winners are awarded a replica of the trophy (the original remains with UEFA), while the losing finalists and semi-finalists are presented with a plaque.[3] Gold and silver medals are awarded to the players of the winning and losing finalists respectively.[4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nUEFA European Championship\n |\n| --- |\n| Tournaments | * France 1960\n* Spain 1964\n* Italy 1968\n* Belgium 1972\n* Yugoslavia 1976\n* Italy 1980\n* France 1984\n* West Germany 1988\n* Sweden 1992\n* England 1996\n* Belgium / Netherlands 2000\n* Portugal 2004\n* Austria / Switzerland 2008\n* Poland / Ukraine 2012\n* France 2016\n* Pan-European 2020\u2020\n* *Germany 2024*\n* *United Kingdom / Ireland 2028*\n* *Italy / Turkey 2032*\n |\n| Qualifying | * 1960\n* 1964\n* 1968\n* 1972\n* 1976\n* 1980\n* 1984\n* 1988\n* 1992\n* 1996\n* 2000\n* 2004\n* 2008\n* 2012\n* 2016\n* 2020\n* 2024\n |\n| Finals | * 1960\n* 1964\n* 1968\n* 1972\n* 1976\n* 1980\n* 1984\n* 1988\n* 1992\n* 1996\n* 2000\n* 2004\n* 2008\n* 2012\n* 2016\n* 2020\n* 2024\n |\n| Squads | * 1960\n* 1964\n* 1968\n* 1972\n* 1976\n* 1980\n* 1984\n* 1988\n* 1992\n* 1996\n* 2000\n* 2004\n* 2008\n* 2012\n* 2016\n* 2020\n* 2024\n |\n| Bids | * 2004\n* 2008\n* 2012\n* 2016\n* 2020\n* 2024\n* 2028\n* 2032\n |\n| Statistics | * 1992\n* 1996\n* 2000\n* 2004\n* 2008\n* 2012\n* 2016\n* 2020\n |\n| Broadcasting rights | * 2000\n* 2004\n* 2008\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n44. **^** \"UEFA Euro 1992 \u2013 History\". *UEFA.com*.

Germany and Spain have faced each other 26 times, started with a 2\u20131 friendly victory for Spain on 12 May 1935 in Cologne. However, Spain only met Germany for the first time in any competitive fixture in 1966, as part of the 1966 FIFA World Cup, where Germany (known as West Germany at the time) came back to win 2\u20131.[60] However, since the unification of Germany in 1991, Spain has remained undefeated in competitive fixtures against Germany, including the famous 6\u20130 rout in the 2020\u201321 UEFA Nations League A.[61] Total head-to-head result however is slightly favourable for Germany with 9 wins, 9 draws compared to 8 wins by Spain.\n\n\n## Results and fixtures[edit]\n\n\nFor all past match results of the national team, see single-season articles, and Spain national football team results.\n\nFurther information: 2022\u201323 in Spanish football and 2023\u201324 in Spanish football\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n65. **^** \"https://twitter.com/EURO2024/status/1700189231346286792?s=20\". *X (formerly Twitter)*.

Their first home match away from it was played at the Nikos Goumas Stadium in 1962, while the Karaiskakis Stadium was used for the first time in 1964, when it was renovated. In 1966, Kaftanzoglio Stadium in Thessaloniki became the first stadium outside of the Athens area to be used. Since then all of these stadiums were alternately used until the early 1980s, while a few other stadiums were inaugurated by the national team as well such as Thessaloniki's Toumba Stadium and Harilaou Stadium in 1975 and 1977 respectively. Greece also held matches at other home grounds outside of the two major cities in 1976, such as Panachaiki Stadium in Patras and Kavala Stadium in Kavala. In 1982, Georgios Kamaras Stadium was added to the list of home grounds for the national team, the first in Athens out of the three major stadiums.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe **Greece national football team** (Greek: \u0395\u03b8\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac\u03b4\u03b1\u03c2, *Ethniki Elladas*) represents Greece in men's international football matches, and is controlled by the Hellenic Football Federation, the governing body for football in Greece. Starting in 2023, Greece play their home matches in Nea Filadelfeia, a suburb of Athens, at the newly built Agia Sophia Stadium. Greece is one of only ten national teams to have been crowned UEFA European Champions.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn 16 November 1983, the newly built Athens Olympic Stadium, to date the largest stadium in the country, housed the national team for the first time in a qualifier for UEFA Euro 1984 against Denmark. It served as the primary home ground for the team for the rest of the 1980s and the 1990s, until 2001 when it was closed for renovations. Meanwhile, a large number of matches were held in various stadiums including old choices and some new in provincial cities all over the country, something that did not change until the early 2000s, when the Athens Olympic Stadium was almost abandoned. From the start of the 2000 until the qualifiers games of Euro 2004, the Greek National Team uses Leoforos Stadium as its home. Since 2004 Greece has mainly used Karaiskakis Stadium, with very few of Greece's matches being played in other stadiums. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nGreece national football team\n |\n| --- |\n| General topics | * Hellenic Football Federation\n* History\n* Managers\n |\n| Venues | * Leoforos Alexandras Stadium (until 1982)\n* Olympic Stadium (1982\u20132004)\n* Karaiskakis Stadium (2004\u20132017)\n* Panthessaliko Stadium (2017\u20132022)\n* OPAP Arena (2022\u2013present)\n* List of football stadiums in Greece\n |\n| Results | * 1929\u201359\n* 1960\u201379\n* 1980\u201399\n* 2000\u201319\n* 2020\u2013present\n |\n| Players | * List of Greece international footballers\n* World Cup & Euro Championship squads\n* Other footballers\n* Hat-tricks\n |\n| FIFA World Cup tournaments | * Summary\n* 1994\n* 2010\n* 2014\n |\n| UEFA Euro tournaments | * Summary\n* 1980\n* **2004**\n* 2008\n* 2012\n |\n| FIFA Confed Cup tournaments | * Summary\n* 2005\n |\n| Matches | * UEFA Euro 2004 final\n* Faroe Islands v Greece (2014\u201315)\n |\n| Rivalries | * Turkey\n |\n| Other HFF teams | * U-21\n* U-20\n* U-19\n* U-17\n* Olympic team\n* \u0392each soccer\n* Futsal\n* Women\n* Military\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThey returned to OAKA in 2018 for a friendly against Switzerland and announced they would play their home matches for the new UEFA Nations League there, as well.[52] For the UEFA Euro 2020 qualifiers, they were slated to split time between OAKA in Athens, and the Pankritio Stadium in Heraklion on the island of Crete, but with the latter requiring upgrades to be fit for FIFA standards, the entire campaign was held in Athens. They remained at OAKA until 2021, before making a temporary move to the Georgios Kamaras Stadium in late 2021 for the UEFA Nations League campaign, also hosting two matches in Volos.\n\n\nOn 7 March 2023, it was announced that the new Agia Sophia Stadium in the Nea Filadelfeia section of Athens would become the new home of the Ethniki.\n\n\n\n## Team image[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Greece national football team kits.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n47. **^** \"Greece v Colombia\". *ESPN.com*. 14 June 2014.

The team still hosted friendly matches and minor FIFA World Cup and UEFA European Football Championship qualification matches at other venues. Twice France have played home matches in a French overseas department\u00a0\u2013 in 2005 against Costa Rica in Fort-de-France (Martinique) and in 2010 against China in Saint Pierre (R\u00e9union). Both matches were friendlies.\n\n\nIn 1998, the Stade de France was inaugurated as France's national stadium ahead of the 1998 World Cup. Located in Saint-Denis, a Parisian suburb, the stadium has an all-seater capacity of 81,338. France's first match at the stadium was played on 28 January 1998 against Spain. France won the match 1\u20130, with Zinedine Zidane scoring the goal. Since that match, France has used the stadium for almost every major home game, including the 1998 World Cup final.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAt the 2022 FIFA World Cup, France looked to defend their title in Qatar.[54] After finishing top of their group, France did manage to reach a second successive World Cup final, defeating Poland, England and Morocco in the knockout stages.[55] However, they were defeated on penalties by Argentina after a thrilling 3\u20133 draw.[56]\n\n\n\n## Home stadium[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Stade de France, Parc des Princes, and INF Clairefontaine\n\nDuring France's early years, the team's national stadium alternated between the Parc des Princes in Paris and the Stade Olympique Yves-du-Manoir in Colombes. France also hosted matches at the Stade Pershing, Stade de Paris, and the Stade Buffalo, but to a minimal degree. As the years moved forward, France began hosting matches outside the city of Paris at such venues as the Stade Marcel Saupin in Nantes, the Stade V\u00e9lodrome in Marseille, the Stade de Gerland in Lyon, and the Stade de la Meinau in Strasbourg.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPrior to matches, home or away, the national team trains at the INF Clairefontaine academy in Clairefontaine-en-Yvelines. Clairefontaine is the national association football centre and is among 12 \u00e9lite academies throughout the country. The centre was inaugurated in 1976 by former FFF president Fernand Sastre and opened in 1988. The center drew media spotlight following its usage as a base camp by the team that won the 1998 World Cup.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nFrance national football team\n |\n| --- |\n| General topics | * French Football Federation\n* History\n* Managers\n* Kits\n |\n| Results | * 1904\u201320\n* 1921\u201359\n* 1960\u201379\n* 1980\u201399\n* 2000\u201319\n* 2020\u2013present\n* Unofficial matches\n |\n| Venues | * Parc des Princes\n* Stade de France\n* Stade Olympique Yves-du-Manoir\n |\n| Statistics | * All-time record\n* All-time goalscorers\n* Hat-tricks\n* Records\n |\n| Players | * Players (by caps)\n* Captains\n |\n| Goals | * Olivier Giroud\n* Thierry Henry\n |\n| FIFA World Cup tournaments | * Summary\n* 1930\n* 1934\n* 1938\n* 1954\n* 1958\n* 1966\n* 1978\n* 1982\n* 1986\n* **1998**\n* 2002\n* 2006\n* 2010\n* 2014\n* **2018**\n* 2022\n |\n| UEFA Euro tournaments | * Summary\n* 1960\n* **1984**\n* 1992\n* 1996\n* **2000**\n* 2004\n* 2008\n* 2012\n* 2016\n* 2020\n* *2024*\n |\n| UEFA Nations League finals | * Summary\n* **2021**\n |\n| FIFA Confederations Cup tournaments | * Summary\n* **2001**\n* **2003**\n |\n| Other tournaments | * Olympics\n* Tournoi de France\n* Mediterranean Games\n |\n| Rivalries | * Belgium\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| ![Gold medal \u2013 first place](image) | 1984 Los Angeles | Team |\n| ![Silver medal \u2013 second place](image) | 1900 Paris | Team |\n| CONMEBOL\u2013UEFA Cup of Champions |\n| ![Gold medal \u2013 first place](image) | 1985 Paris | Team |\n |\n\n\nThe **France national football team** (French: *\u00c9quipe de France de football*) represents France in men's international football.

Two years after that, France won the 2018 World Cup, its second title in that competition. After winning the 2021 Nations League, they became the first, and so far, the only European national team to have won every senior FIFA and UEFA competition.[3][4] France is also one of the only two countries, the other being Brazil, to have won all men's FIFA 11-player competitions at all age levels,[5][6][7][8][9] having claimed both the FIFA World Cup, FIFA U-20 World Cup, FIFA U-17 World Cup, the now-defunct FIFA Confederations Cup, and Olympics titles, as well as the first to complete the collection, after the U-20 national team captured the first U-20 World Cup title in 2013.[7]\n\n\nFrance has footballing rivalries[10] with Belgium,[11] Brazil,[12] England,[13] Germany,[14] Italy,[15] and Spain.[16]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the France national football team\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe France national football team was created in 1904, around the time of FIFA's foundation.[17] The team competed in its first official international match on 1 May 1904 against Belgium in Brussels, ending in a 3\u20133 draw.[18] The following year, on 12 February 1905, France contested their first-ever home match against Switzerland. The match was played at the Parc des Princes in front of 500 supporters. France won the match 1\u20130 with the only goal coming from Gaston Cypr\u00e8s. Due to disagreements between FIFA and the *Union des Soci\u00e9t\u00e9s Fran\u00e7aises de Sports Athl\u00e9tiques* (USFSA), the country's sports union, France struggled to establish an identity. On 9 May 1908, the French Interfederal Committee (CFI), a rival organization to the USFSA, ruled that FIFA would now be responsible for the club's appearances in forthcoming Olympic Games and not the USFSA. In 1919, the CFI transformed themselves into the French Football Federation (FFF). In 1921, the USFSA finally merged with the FFF.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThis article is about the men's team.

The colours are derived from the 19th-century flag of the North German State of Prussia.[146] Since 1988, many of the home kit's designs incorporate details patterned after the modern German flag. For the 2014 World Cup, Germany's kit was white shorts rather than the traditional black due to FIFA's kit clashing rule for the tournament.[147] The away shirt colour has changed several times. Historically, a green shirt with white shorts is the most often used alternative colour combination, derived from the DFB colours\u00a0\u2013 though it is often erroneously reported that the choice is in recognition of the fact that Ireland, whose home shirts are green, were the first nation to play Germany in a friendly game after World War II. However, the first team to play Germany after WWII, as stated above, was actually Switzerland.[148] Other colours such as red, grey and black have also been used.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 13 June 2012\n | ![](image)\u00a0Netherlands | Kharkiv, UKR\n | \\*\n | 2\u20131\n | EC 2012 Group | G\u00f3mez ![](image) 24', 38' |\n| 17 June 2012\n | ![](image)\u00a0Denmark | Lviv, UKR\n | \\*\n | 2\u20131\n | EC 2012 Group | Podolski ![](image) 19', Bender ![](image) 80' |\n| 22 June 2012\n | ![](image)\u00a0Greece | Gda\u0144sk, POL\n | \\*\n | 4\u20132\n | EC 2012 Quarter final | Lahm ![](image) 39', Khedira ![](image) 61', Klose ![](image) 68', Reus ![](image) 74' |\n\n\n## Competitive record[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Germany national football team records and statistics\n\n* 1930\u20131938 as ![](image) \u2192 ![](image) \u2192 ![](image)\u00a0Germany\n* 1950\u20131990 as ![](image)\u00a0West Germany\n* 1994\u2013present as ![](image)\u00a0Germany\n\n\n\u00a0 **Champions**\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 **Runners-up**\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Third place\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tournament played fully or partially on home soil\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the 2022 World Cup, Germany were drawn into Group E with Spain, Japan and Costa Rica.

During the first 82 years of the national team, from October 1908 until November 1990, Denmark played a total number of 254 A-level home matches, of which 232 were played in Idr\u00e6tsparken. Among all the played home matches in Idr\u00e6tsparken, Denmark achieved 125 victories (54%), 41 draws (18%) and 66 defeats (28%). The stadium reached a record of 51,600 spectators for the 1\u20132 game against Sweden in June 1957.[68]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Parken Stadium, with a capacity of 38,065 spectators, located in Copenhagen, and used as official home stadium by the Denmark national football team.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCurrently, while most of the friendly matches continue to be played at some of the smaller stadiums in Denmark, it has been decided to continue playing all of the qualifying matches for the European Championships and World Cup only at Parken Stadium.[78] Those friendly matches, which are believed to create a high interest from spectators, will also continue to be played at Parken. For example, the friendly against Germany in August 2010 was played at Parken Stadium due to the high expectation of spectators desiring to watch the match. However, after Denmark's performance at the 2010 World Cup, the friendly only drew 19,071 spectators.[79] From September 1992 to January 2012, Denmark played a total of 77 A-level matches at Parken Stadium, of which 49 were won, 16 were drawn and 12 lost.[80]\n\n\n\n## Results and fixtures[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Denmark national football team results (2020\u2013present)\n\nThe following is a list of match results in the last 12 months, as well as any future matches that have been scheduled.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n## Home stadium[edit]\n\n\nFor stadium history, see Parken Stadium.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe **Denmark men's national football team** (Danish: *Danmarks herre-fodboldlandshold* or *herrelandsholdet*) represents Denmark and Greenland in men's international football competitions.

Denmark's home stadium is Parken Stadium in the \u00d8sterbro district of Copenhagen; their head coach is Kasper Hjulmand.\n\n\nDenmark were the winners of the 1906 Intercalated Games football competition and silver medalists at the 1908 and 1912 Olympics. However, as amateurs who prohibited their internationals from becoming professionals at foreign clubs, Denmark did not qualify for the FIFA World Cup until 1986, although they won another Olympic silver in 1960.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nDenmark national football team\n |\n| --- |\n| General | * Danish Football Union\n* Managers\n |\n| Venues | * Parken Stadium\n* Idr\u00e6tsparken\n |\n| Statistics | * Results\n\t+ 1908\u20131929\n\t+ 1930\u20131949\n\t+ 1950\u20131959\n\t+ 1960\u20131969\n\t+ 1970\u20131979\n\t+ 1980\u20131989\n\t+ 1990\u20131999\n\t+ 2000\u20132009\n\t+ 2010\u20132019\n\t+ 2020\u2013present\n* Records and statistics\n |\n| Players | * Players with 25+ caps\n* 1\u201324 caps\n* All players\n |\n| Goals | * Poul Nielsen\n* Hat-tricks\n |\n| World Finals | * Summary\n* 1986\n* 1998\n* 2002\n* 2010\n* 2018\n* 2022\n |\n| European Finals | * Summary\n* 1964\n* 1984\n* 1988\n* **1992**\n* 1996\n* 2000\n* 2004\n* 2012\n* 2020\n* *2024*\n |\n| Culture | * Rivalry with Sweden\n\t+ abandoned Euro 2008 qualifier\n* Roligan\n* Landsholdet\n* 1960 air crash\n* Notable matches\n |\n| Other national teams | * Men's\n\t+ Under 17s\n\t+ Under 19s\n\t+ Under 21s\n\t+ Danish League XI\n* Women's\n\t+ Under 17s\n\t+ Under 19s\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe capacity of the stadium was later reduced to 38,009 seats after the upper part of the D-side was converted from 4,000 extra seats into office and VIP areas in June 2009.[71][72] Despite this decrease in capacity, the stadium is today still the biggest venue in Denmark by far; the next largest venue, Br\u00f8ndby Stadium, only has a capacity of 26,000 seats. From September 1992 to May 2006, Parken was the sole stadium of all the men's senior national team matches. However, meagre spectator support at some of the friendly matches at Parken, which from 2000 to 2005 attracted an acceptable average of 23,862 per match \u2013 but down to 9,598 for the friendly 3\u20131 win over Israel in April 2002[73] \u2013 prompted the DBU to start hosting many of the friendly matches to other stadiums around Denmark. These other stadiums had less spectator capacity than Parken, but just about enough to cover the Danes' somewhat lesser interest for friendly matches.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n108. **^** SBU (2004). \"Players bonus (1st August 2004 to 31st July 2010)\".\n109. **^** \"Denmark\". *National Football Teams*.\n110. **^** As UEFA Euro 1992 Champions\n111. **^** TV2 Sporten (29 September 2009). \"Dynamit-holdet i Hall of Fame\" (in Danish).`{{cite web}}`: CS1 maint: numeric names: authors list (link)\n\n## Literature[edit]\n\n\n* Palle \"Banks\" J\u00f8rgensen (2002), \"*Landsholdets 681 profiler fra 1908 til i dag*\" (in Danish), TIPS-Bladet, ISBN\u00a087-91264-01-4.\n\n\n## External links[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Denmark national association football team.\n\n* Official website\n* Denmark at FIFA\n* Denmark at UEFA\n* Official player and match statistics\n* Official league national team page (Archived 26 March 2010 at the Wayback Machine)\n* Official national team shop\n* De Danske Roligans (archived 11 June 2001)\n* National team, players and others (statistics)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 9 September 1992, the rebuilt Idr\u00e6tsparken, now called **Parken** and later renamed **Telia Parken** for sponsorship reasons, became the biggest venue in Denmark with a capacity of 42,358 spectators, and was opened with a friendly 1\u20132 defeat against Germany.

Whenever another stadium than Idr\u00e6tsparken was used for a home match, it was only for some of the less important friendly games or Olympic qualifiers. While only Idr\u00e6tsparken was used to host the matches related to big important tournaments, like the Nordic championship, the UEFA European Championship and FIFA World Cup. When a major rebuild of Idr\u00e6tsparken began in December 1990, the subsequent two official Euro 1992 qualification matches were moved to Odense Stadium in Odense.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn 27 May 2006, Parken's 13-year monopoly on national team matches was broken for the first time when Denmark played a friendly match at the Aarhus Idr\u00e6tspark against upcoming 2006 World Cup participants Paraguay. Tickets to this match were sold out quickly, with almost 19,000 of the 20,227 tickets sold within the first hour of sale,[74] and was support-wise a big success with a total audience of 20,047 spectators.[75] When the two next friendly matches were played at some other new venues, 16 August at Fionia Park in Odense against Poland, and on 1 September at Br\u00f8ndby Stadium against Portugal, the number of spectators dropped to a disappointing level. The Poland match attracted only 11,088 spectators,[76] while the Portugal match only 13,186 spectators.[77] In particular, the Portugal match was deemed as a support-wise failure because it featured a higher-ranked opponent, which spectators normally would have a high interest to watch. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n60. **^** Creditor, Avi (26 November 2022). \"Mbappe Dazzles vs. Denmark; France Clinches World Cup Last-16 Spot\". *Sports Illustrated*.

It played host to its first Netherlands international game back in 1997, a 1998 World Cup qualification match against San Marino which the Netherlands won 4\u20130.[102] It was formally called the Amsterdam Arena until 2018 when it was renamed in memory of Johan Cruyff.[103]\n\n\nOver the last few years, De Kuip in Rotterdam has hosted matches more regularly. Occasionally, matches take place at Philips Stadion in Eindhoven and the De Grolsch Veste in Enschede.[104]\n\n\n\n## Results and fixtures[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Netherlands national football team results\n\nThe following is a list of match results in the last 12 months, as well as any future matches that have been scheduled.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Win\n\u00a0\u00a0Draw\n\u00a0\u00a0Loss\n\u00a0\u00a0Fixture\n\n\n\n### 2022[edit]\n\n\nSenegal\u00a0![](image) v ![](image)\u00a0Netherlands\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTo a lesser extent, the Netherlands maintains a rivalry with their other neighbour, Belgium; a Belgium\u2013Netherlands fixture is referred to as a Low Countries derby. They have played in 126 matches as of May\u00a02018[update] with the two competing against each other regularly between 1905 and 1964. This has diminished due to the rise of semi-professional football.[100]\n\n\nIn recent years, the Netherlands has also developed a intercontinental rivalry with Argentina.\n\n\n\n### Media coverage[edit]\n\n\nThe Netherlands national football team matches have broadcast on Nederlandse Omroep Stichting which includes all friendlies, Nations League and World Cup qualifiers. The newest contract is a seven-year deal until 2027.[101]\n\n\n\n## Home stadium[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Website | onsoranje.nl (in Dutch) |\n\n\nThe **Netherlands national football team** (Dutch: *Nederlands voetbalelftal* or simply *Het Nederlands elftal*) has represented the Netherlands in international men's football matches since 1905. The men's national team is controlled by the Royal Dutch Football Association (KNVB), the governing body for football in the Netherlands, which is a part of UEFA, under the jurisdiction of FIFA. They were sometimes regarded as the greatest national team of the respective generations.[6][7][8][9] Most of the Netherlands home matches are played at the Johan Cruyff Arena, De Kuip, Philips Stadion and De Grolsch Veste.\n\n\nThe team is colloquially referred to as *Het Nederlands Elftal* (The Dutch Eleven) or *Oranje*, after the House of Orange-Nassau and their distinctive orange jerseys. Informally the team, like the country itself, was referred to as ***Holland***. The fan club is known as *Het Oranje Legioen* (The Orange Legion).[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nNetherlands national football team\n |\n| --- |\n| * History\n* Royal Dutch Football Association\n |\n| General | * History\n* Managers\n |\n| Venues | * Johan Cruyff Arena\n* Philips Stadion\n* De Kuip\n |\n| Statistics | * Results\n* Records\n* Hat-tricks\n |\n| Results | * 1905\u20131919\n* 1920\u20131939\n* 1940\u20131959\n* 1960\u20131979\n* 1980\u20131999\n* 2000\u20132009\n* 2010\u20132019\n* 2020\u2013present\n |\n| Players | * Current\n* Players\n* World Cup & Euro Championship squads\n* Born outside Netherlands\n* Other categories\n |\n| Goals | * Robin van Persie\n* Memphis Depay\n |\n| Rivalries | * Argentina\n* Belgium\n* Germany\n |\n| FIFA World Cup | * Summary\n* 1934\n* 1938\n* 1974\n* 1978\n* 1990\n* 1994\n* 1998\n* 2006\n* 2010\n* 2014\n* 2022\n |\n| UEFA European Championship | * Summary\n* 1976\n* 1980\n* **1988**\n* 1992\n* 1996\n* 2000\n* 2004\n* 2008\n* 2012\n* 2020\n* *2024*\n |\n| Other tournaments | * Belgium vs Netherlands Cups (1905\u20131932)\n* Summer Olympics (1908\u20131952)\n* UEFA Nations League (2018\u2013)\n |\n| Culture | * De kabel\n* Total Football\n |\n| Other KNVB teams | * Men\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Netherlands national association football team.\n\n* onsoranje.nl \u2013 official website (in Dutch)\n* voetbalstats.nl \u2013 statistics of the national football team (in Dutch)\n* Netherlands at UEFA\n* Netherlands at FIFA\n* Netherlands internationals at the RSSSF archive\n* Netherlands managers at the RSSSF archive\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nUEFA European Championship winners\n |\n| --- |\n| * **1960:** ![](image)\u00a0Soviet Union\n* **1964:** ![](image)\u00a0Spain\n* **1968:** ![](image)\u00a0Italy\n* **1972:** ![](image)\u00a0West Germany\n* **1976:** ![](image)\u00a0Czechoslovakia\n* **1980:** ![](image)\u00a0West Germany\n* **1984:** ![](image)\u00a0France\n* **1988:** ![](image)\u00a0Netherlands\n* **1992:** ![](image)\u00a0Denmark\n* **1996:** ![](image)\u00a0Germany\n* **2000:** ![](image)\u00a0France\n* **2004:** ![](image)\u00a0Greece\n* **2008:** ![](image)\u00a0Spain\n* **2012:** ![](image)\u00a0Spain\n* **2016:** ![](image)\u00a0Portugal\n* **2020:** ![](image)\u00a0Italy\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n![Netherlands](image) Football in the Netherlands\n |\n| --- |\n| Overview | * Association\n* League system\n* Clubs\n* 'Big Three'\n* Stadiums\n* Champions\n* Players\n* Top scorers\n* Managers\n* Referees\n* Footballer of the Year\n |\n| International | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Men | * Netherlands\n* B team\n* U-21\n* U-19\n* U-17\n* U-16\n* Variants (Beach\n* Futsal)\n |\n| Women | * Netherlands women\n* W U-19\n* W U-17\n |\n\n |\n| Leagues | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![Netherlands](image) Sipke Hulshoff\n |\n| Goalkeeping coach\n | ![Netherlands](image) Patrick Lodewijks |\n| Fitness coaches\n | ![Netherlands](image) Jan Kluitenberg\n\n---\n\n![Netherlands](image) Martin Cruijff\n |\n| Team manager\n | ![Netherlands](image) Cor Asp\n |\n| Sports Scientist\n | ![Netherlands](image) David van Maurik\n |\n| Physiotherapist(s)\n | ![Netherlands](image) Ricardo de Sanders\n\n---\n\n![Netherlands](image) Gert-Jan Goudswaard\n\n---\n\n![Netherlands](image) Luc van Agt\n |\n| Doctor(s)\n | ![Netherlands](image) Edwin Goedhart\n\n---\n\n![Netherlands](image) Rien Heijboer\n |\n| Masseurs\n | ![Netherlands](image) Rob Koster\n |\n| Analyst(s)\n | ![Netherlands](image) Cees Lok\n\n---\n\n![Netherlands](image) Gert Aandewiel\n\n---\n\n![Netherlands](image) Dennis Demmers\n |\n\n\n### Coaching history[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Netherlands national football team managers\n\n## Players[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Netherlands international footballers\n\n### Current squad[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMen's association football team\n\nThis article is about the men's team.

However, the tournament ended in disappointment for the Netherlands once more, as they were beaten 2\u20130 by the Czech Republic in their Round of 16 tie in Budapest, after a Matthijs de Ligt red card. Two days later, De Boer left his position.[92] He was replaced by Louis van Gaal, who came out of retirement to return for a third spell in charge of the side.[93] On 16 November 2021, the Netherlands qualified for the 2022 World Cup after beating Norway 2\u20130 and topping their qualification group on the final day. In the 2022 World Cup, the Netherlands topped their group with 7 points. They progressed to the quarterfinals where they eventually lost to Argentina on penalties.[94]\n\n\n\n## Team image[edit]\n\n\n### Kits and crest[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Netherlands national football team kits.\n\n![](image)Dutch fans wearing the traditional orange colours at a 2006 World Cup match in Stuttgart\nThe Netherlands national football team famously plays in bright orange shirts. Orange is the historic national colour of the Netherlands, originating from one of the many title of the ruling head of state, Prince of Orange. The current Netherlands away shirt is blue. The lion on the crest is the Netherlands' national and royal animal and has been on the crest since 1907 when they won 3\u20131 over Belgium.[95]\n\n\nNike is the national team's kit provider, a sponsorship that began in 1996 and is contracted to continue until at least 2026.[96] Before that the team was supplied by Adidas and Lotto.[97]\n\n\n\n### Kit suppliers[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nNetherlands squad \u2013 UEFA Euro 2020\n |\n| --- |\n| * 1\u00a0Stekelenburg\n* 2\u00a0Veltman\n* 3\u00a0De\u00a0Ligt\n* 4\u00a0Ak\u00e9\n* 5\u00a0Wijndal\n* 6\u00a0De\u00a0Vrij\n* 7\u00a0Berghuis\n* 8\u00a0Wijnaldum\u00a0(c)\n* 9\u00a0L.\u00a0de\u00a0Jong\n* 10\u00a0Depay\n* 11\u00a0Promes\n* 12\u00a0Van\u00a0Aanholt\n* 13\u00a0Krul\n* 14\u00a0Klaassen\n* 15\u00a0De\u00a0Roon\n* 16\u00a0Gravenberch\n* 17\u00a0Blind\n* 18\u00a0Malen\n* 19\u00a0Weghorst\n* 21\u00a0F.\u00a0de\u00a0Jong\n* 22\u00a0Dumfries\n* 23\u00a0Bizot\n* 24\u00a0Koopmeiners\n* 25\u00a0Timber\n* 26\u00a0Gakpo\n* Coach:\u00a0De\u00a0Boer\n | ![Netherlands](image)\n |\n |\n\n| Netherlands FIFA World Cup squads\n |\n| --- |\n| | * v\n* t\n* e\nNetherlands squad \u2013 1934 FIFA World Cup\n |\n| --- |\n| * GK\u00a0Halle\n* GK\u00a0Van\u00a0Male\n* GK\u00a0Van\u00a0der\u00a0Meulen\n* DF\u00a0Van\u00a0Diepenbeek\n* DF\u00a0Van\u00a0Run\n* DF\u00a0Weber\n* MF\u00a0Anderiesen\n* MF\u00a0Van\u00a0Heel\u00a0(c)\n* MF\u00a0Oprinsen\n* MF\u00a0Paauwe\n* MF\u00a0Pellikaan\n* FW\u00a0Bakhuys\n* FW\u00a0Graafland\n* FW\u00a0Lagendaal\n* FW\u00a0Mijnders\n* FW\u00a0Mol\n* FW\u00a0Van\u00a0Nellen\n* FW\u00a0Schoemaker\n* FW\u00a0Smit\n* FW\u00a0Vente\n* FW\u00a0Vrauwdeunt\n* FW\u00a0Wels\n* Coach:\u00a0Glendenning\n | ![Netherlands](image)\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n91. **^** \"Wijnaldum winner not enough for Dutch\". *BBC Sport*.
