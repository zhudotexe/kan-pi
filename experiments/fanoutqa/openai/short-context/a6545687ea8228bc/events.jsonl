Until 2016, the championship winners could compete in the following year's FIFA Confederations Cup, but were not obliged to do so.[3] From the 2020 edition onwards, the winner competes in the CONMEBOL–UEFA Cup of Champions.\n\n\nThe sixteen European Championship tournaments have been won by ten national teams: Germany and Spain have each won three titles, Italy and France have won two titles, and the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, the Netherlands, Denmark, Greece and Portugal have won one title each. To date, Spain is the only team to have won consecutive titles, doing so in 2008 and 2012.\n\n\nThe most recent championship, held across Europe in 2021 (postponed from 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic), was won by Italy, who lifted their second European title after beating England in the final at Wembley Stadium in London on penalties.[4][5]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Beginnings[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n79. **^** \"Uefa to expand Euro Championship\". *BBC Sport*.

The competition is contested by UEFA members' senior men's national teams, determining the continental champion of Europe. It is the second-most watched football tournament in the world after the FIFA World Cup. The Euro 2012 final was watched by a global audience of around 300 million.[2] The competition has been held every four years since 1960, except for 2020, when it was postponed until 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe, but kept the name Euro 2020. Scheduled to be in the even-numbered year between FIFA World Cup tournaments, it was originally called the **European Nations' Cup** before changing to its current name in 1968. Since 1996, the individual events have been branded as \"**UEFA Euro [year]**\".\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nUEFA European Championship\n |\n| --- |\n| Tournaments | * France 1960\n* Spain 1964\n* Italy 1968\n* Belgium 1972\n* Yugoslavia 1976\n* Italy 1980\n* France 1984\n* West Germany 1988\n* Sweden 1992\n* England 1996\n* Belgium / Netherlands 2000\n* Portugal 2004\n* Austria / Switzerland 2008\n* Poland / Ukraine 2012\n* France 2016\n* Pan-European 2020†\n* *Germany 2024*\n* *United Kingdom / Ireland 2028*\n* *Italy / Turkey 2032*\n |\n| Qualifying | * 1960\n* 1964\n* 1968\n* 1972\n* 1976\n* 1980\n* 1984\n* 1988\n* 1992\n* 1996\n* 2000\n* 2004\n* 2008\n* 2012\n* 2016\n* 2020\n* 2024\n |\n| Finals | * 1960\n* 1964\n* 1968\n* 1972\n* 1976\n* 1980\n* 1984\n* 1988\n* 1992\n* 1996\n* 2000\n* 2004\n* 2008\n* 2012\n* 2016\n* 2020\n* 2024\n |\n| Squads | * 1960\n* 1964\n* 1968\n* 1972\n* 1976\n* 1980\n* 1984\n* 1988\n* 1992\n* 1996\n* 2000\n* 2004\n* 2008\n* 2012\n* 2016\n* 2020\n* 2024\n |\n| Bids | * 2004\n* 2008\n* 2012\n* 2016\n* 2020\n* 2024\n* 2028\n* 2032\n |\n| Statistics | * 1992\n* 1996\n* 2000\n* 2004\n* 2008\n* 2012\n* 2016\n* 2020\n |\n| Broadcasting rights | * 2000\n* 2004\n* 2008\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Regulations of the UEFA European Football Championship 2018–20\". *UEFA.com*.

The winners of the first final were the Soviet Union, who defeated Yugoslavia 2–1 in Paris, after extra time. The most recent final, hosted in London in 2021, was won by Italy, who beat England 3–2 on penalties.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe European Championship final is the last match of the competition, and the result determines which country's team is declared European champion. As of the 2020 tournament, if after 90 minutes of regular play the score is a draw, an additional 30-minute period of play, called extra time, is added. If such a game is still tied after extra time, it is decided by penalty shoot-out. The team that wins the penalty shoot-out are then declared champions.[1] The 16 finals to-date have produced seven drawn matches, the eventual winners of which have been determined variously by replay (1968), extra time (1960, 2016), penalty shoot-out (1976, 2020) or golden goal (1996, 2000).[2] The winners are awarded a replica of the trophy (the original remains with UEFA), while the losing finalists and semi-finalists are presented with a plaque.[3] Gold and silver medals are awarded to the players of the winning and losing finalists respectively.[4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nUEFA European Championship\n |\n| --- |\n| Tournaments | * France 1960\n* Spain 1964\n* Italy 1968\n* Belgium 1972\n* Yugoslavia 1976\n* Italy 1980\n* France 1984\n* West Germany 1988\n* Sweden 1992\n* England 1996\n* Belgium / Netherlands 2000\n* Portugal 2004\n* Austria / Switzerland 2008\n* Poland / Ukraine 2012\n* France 2016\n* Pan-European 2020†\n* *Germany 2024*\n* *United Kingdom / Ireland 2028*\n* *Italy / Turkey 2032*\n |\n| Qualifying | * 1960\n* 1964\n* 1968\n* 1972\n* 1976\n* 1980\n* 1984\n* 1988\n* 1992\n* 1996\n* 2000\n* 2004\n* 2008\n* 2012\n* 2016\n* 2020\n* 2024\n |\n| Finals | * 1960\n* 1964\n* 1968\n* 1972\n* 1976\n* 1980\n* 1984\n* 1988\n* 1992\n* 1996\n* 2000\n* 2004\n* 2008\n* 2012\n* 2016\n* 2020\n* 2024\n |\n| Squads | * 1960\n* 1964\n* 1968\n* 1972\n* 1976\n* 1980\n* 1984\n* 1988\n* 1992\n* 1996\n* 2000\n* 2004\n* 2008\n* 2012\n* 2016\n* 2020\n* 2024\n |\n| Bids | * 2004\n* 2008\n* 2012\n* 2016\n* 2020\n* 2024\n* 2028\n* 2032\n |\n| Statistics | * 1992\n* 1996\n* 2000\n* 2004\n* 2008\n* 2012\n* 2016\n* 2020\n |\n| Broadcasting rights | * 2000\n* 2004\n* 2008\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n44. **^** \"UEFA Euro 1992 – History\". *UEFA.com*.

The team still hosted friendly matches and minor FIFA World Cup and UEFA European Football Championship qualification matches at other venues. Twice France have played home matches in a French overseas department – in 2005 against Costa Rica in Fort-de-France (Martinique) and in 2010 against China in Saint Pierre (Réunion). Both matches were friendlies.\n\n\nIn 1998, the Stade de France was inaugurated as France's national stadium ahead of the 1998 World Cup. Located in Saint-Denis, a Parisian suburb, the stadium has an all-seater capacity of 81,338. France's first match at the stadium was played on 28 January 1998 against Spain. France won the match 1–0, with Zinedine Zidane scoring the goal. Since that match, France has used the stadium for almost every major home game, including the 1998 World Cup final.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAt the 2022 FIFA World Cup, France looked to defend their title in Qatar.[54] After finishing top of their group, France did manage to reach a second successive World Cup final, defeating Poland, England and Morocco in the knockout stages.[55] However, they were defeated on penalties by Argentina after a thrilling 3–3 draw.[56]\n\n\n\n## Home stadium[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Stade de France, Parc des Princes, and INF Clairefontaine\n\nDuring France's early years, the team's national stadium alternated between the Parc des Princes in Paris and the Stade Olympique Yves-du-Manoir in Colombes. France also hosted matches at the Stade Pershing, Stade de Paris, and the Stade Buffalo, but to a minimal degree. As the years moved forward, France began hosting matches outside the city of Paris at such venues as the Stade Marcel Saupin in Nantes, the Stade Vélodrome in Marseille, the Stade de Gerland in Lyon, and the Stade de la Meinau in Strasbourg.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPrior to matches, home or away, the national team trains at the INF Clairefontaine academy in Clairefontaine-en-Yvelines. Clairefontaine is the national association football centre and is among 12 élite academies throughout the country. The centre was inaugurated in 1976 by former FFF president Fernand Sastre and opened in 1988. The center drew media spotlight following its usage as a base camp by the team that won the 1998 World Cup.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nFrance national football team\n |\n| --- |\n| General topics | * French Football Federation\n* History\n* Managers\n* Kits\n |\n| Results | * 1904–20\n* 1921–59\n* 1960–79\n* 1980–99\n* 2000–19\n* 2020–present\n* Unofficial matches\n |\n| Venues | * Parc des Princes\n* Stade de France\n* Stade Olympique Yves-du-Manoir\n |\n| Statistics | * All-time record\n* All-time goalscorers\n* Hat-tricks\n* Records\n |\n| Players | * Players (by caps)\n* Captains\n |\n| Goals | * Olivier Giroud\n* Thierry Henry\n |\n| FIFA World Cup tournaments | * Summary\n* 1930\n* 1934\n* 1938\n* 1954\n* 1958\n* 1966\n* 1978\n* 1982\n* 1986\n* **1998**\n* 2002\n* 2006\n* 2010\n* 2014\n* **2018**\n* 2022\n |\n| UEFA Euro tournaments | * Summary\n* 1960\n* **1984**\n* 1992\n* 1996\n* **2000**\n* 2004\n* 2008\n* 2012\n* 2016\n* 2020\n* *2024*\n |\n| UEFA Nations League finals | * Summary\n* **2021**\n |\n| FIFA Confederations Cup tournaments | * Summary\n* **2001**\n* **2003**\n |\n| Other tournaments | * Olympics\n* Tournoi de France\n* Mediterranean Games\n |\n| Rivalries | * Belgium\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) | 1984 Los Angeles | Team |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) | 1900 Paris | Team |\n| CONMEBOL–UEFA Cup of Champions |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) | 1985 Paris | Team |\n |\n\n\nThe **France national football team** (French: *Équipe de France de football*) represents France in men's international football.

Two years after that, France won the 2018 World Cup, its second title in that competition. After winning the 2021 Nations League, they became the first, and so far, the only European national team to have won every senior FIFA and UEFA competition.[3][4] France is also one of the only two countries, the other being Brazil, to have won all men's FIFA 11-player competitions at all age levels,[5][6][7][8][9] having claimed both the FIFA World Cup, FIFA U-20 World Cup, FIFA U-17 World Cup, the now-defunct FIFA Confederations Cup, and Olympics titles, as well as the first to complete the collection, after the U-20 national team captured the first U-20 World Cup title in 2013.[7]\n\n\nFrance has footballing rivalries[10] with Belgium,[11] Brazil,[12] England,[13] Germany,[14] Italy,[15] and Spain.[16]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the France national football team\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe France national football team was created in 1904, around the time of FIFA's foundation.[17] The team competed in its first official international match on 1 May 1904 against Belgium in Brussels, ending in a 3–3 draw.[18] The following year, on 12 February 1905, France contested their first-ever home match against Switzerland. The match was played at the Parc des Princes in front of 500 supporters. France won the match 1–0 with the only goal coming from Gaston Cyprès. Due to disagreements between FIFA and the *Union des Sociétés Françaises de Sports Athlétiques* (USFSA), the country's sports union, France struggled to establish an identity. On 9 May 1908, the French Interfederal Committee (CFI), a rival organization to the USFSA, ruled that FIFA would now be responsible for the club's appearances in forthcoming Olympic Games and not the USFSA. In 1919, the CFI transformed themselves into the French Football Federation (FFF). In 1921, the USFSA finally merged with the FFF.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThis article is about the men's team.

The colours are derived from the 19th-century flag of the North German State of Prussia.[146] Since 1988, many of the home kit's designs incorporate details patterned after the modern German flag. For the 2014 World Cup, Germany's kit was white shorts rather than the traditional black due to FIFA's kit clashing rule for the tournament.[147] The away shirt colour has changed several times. Historically, a green shirt with white shorts is the most often used alternative colour combination, derived from the DFB colours – though it is often erroneously reported that the choice is in recognition of the fact that Ireland, whose home shirts are green, were the first nation to play Germany in a friendly game after World War II.

Their first home match away from it was played at the Nikos Goumas Stadium in 1962, while the Karaiskakis Stadium was used for the first time in 1964, when it was renovated. In 1966, Kaftanzoglio Stadium in Thessaloniki became the first stadium outside of the Athens area to be used. Since then all of these stadiums were alternately used until the early 1980s, while a few other stadiums were inaugurated by the national team as well such as Thessaloniki's Toumba Stadium and Harilaou Stadium in 1975 and 1977 respectively. Greece also held matches at other home grounds outside of the two major cities in 1976, such as Panachaiki Stadium in Patras and Kavala Stadium in Kavala. In 1982, Georgios Kamaras Stadium was added to the list of home grounds for the national team, the first in Athens out of the three major stadiums.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe **Greece national football team** (Greek: Εθνική Ελλάδας, *Ethniki Elladas*) represents Greece in men's international football matches, and is controlled by the Hellenic Football Federation, the governing body for football in Greece. Starting in 2023, Greece play their home matches in Nea Filadelfeia, a suburb of Athens, at the newly built Agia Sophia Stadium. Greece is one of only ten national teams to have been crowned UEFA European Champions.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn 16 November 1983, the newly built Athens Olympic Stadium, to date the largest stadium in the country, housed the national team for the first time in a qualifier for UEFA Euro 1984 against Denmark. It served as the primary home ground for the team for the rest of the 1980s and the 1990s, until 2001 when it was closed for renovations. Meanwhile, a large number of matches were held in various stadiums including old choices and some new in provincial cities all over the country, something that did not change until the early 2000s, when the Athens Olympic Stadium was almost abandoned. From the start of the 2000 until the qualifiers games of Euro 2004, the Greek National Team uses Leoforos Stadium as its home. Since 2004 Greece has mainly used Karaiskakis Stadium, with very few of Greece's matches being played in other stadiums. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nGreece national football team\n |\n| --- |\n| General topics | * Hellenic Football Federation\n* History\n* Managers\n |\n| Venues | * Leoforos Alexandras Stadium (until 1982)\n* Olympic Stadium (1982–2004)\n* Karaiskakis Stadium (2004–2017)\n* Panthessaliko Stadium (2017–2022)\n* OPAP Arena (2022–present)\n* List of football stadiums in Greece\n |\n| Results | * 1929–59\n* 1960–79\n* 1980–99\n* 2000–19\n* 2020–present\n |\n| Players | * List of Greece international footballers\n* World Cup & Euro Championship squads\n* Other footballers\n* Hat-tricks\n |\n| FIFA World Cup tournaments | * Summary\n* 1994\n* 2010\n* 2014\n |\n| UEFA Euro tournaments | * Summary\n* 1980\n* **2004**\n* 2008\n* 2012\n |\n| FIFA Confed Cup tournaments | * Summary\n* 2005\n |\n| Matches | * UEFA Euro 2004 final\n* Faroe Islands v Greece (2014–15)\n |\n| Rivalries | * Turkey\n |\n| Other HFF teams | * U-21\n* U-20\n* U-19\n* U-17\n* Olympic team\n* Βeach soccer\n* Futsal\n* Women\n* Military\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThey returned to OAKA in 2018 for a friendly against Switzerland and announced they would play their home matches for the new UEFA Nations League there, as well.[52] For the UEFA Euro 2020 qualifiers, they were slated to split time between OAKA in Athens, and the Pankritio Stadium in Heraklion on the island of Crete, but with the latter requiring upgrades to be fit for FIFA standards, the entire campaign was held in Athens.

Two days later, De Boer left his position.[92] He was replaced by Louis van Gaal, who came out of retirement to return for a third spell in charge of the side.[93] On 16 November 2021, the Netherlands qualified for the 2022 World Cup after beating Norway 2–0 and topping their qualification group on the final day.

During the first 82 years of the national team, from October 1908 until November 1990, Denmark played a total number of 254 A-level home matches, of which 232 were played in Idrætsparken. Among all the played home matches in Idrætsparken, Denmark achieved 125 victories (54%), 41 draws (18%) and 66 defeats (28%). The stadium reached a record of 51,600 spectators for the 1–2 game against Sweden in June 1957.[68]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Parken Stadium, with a capacity of 38,065 spectators, located in Copenhagen, and used as official home stadium by the Denmark national football team.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCurrently, while most of the friendly matches continue to be played at some of the smaller stadiums in Denmark, it has been decided to continue playing all of the qualifying matches for the European Championships and World Cup only at Parken Stadium.[78] Those friendly matches, which are believed to create a high interest from spectators, will also continue to be played at Parken. For example, the friendly against Germany in August 2010 was played at Parken Stadium due to the high expectation of spectators desiring to watch the match. However, after Denmark's performance at the 2010 World Cup, the friendly only drew 19,071 spectators.[79] From September 1992 to January 2012, Denmark played a total of 77 A-level matches at Parken Stadium, of which 49 were won, 16 were drawn and 12 lost.[80]\n\n\n\n## Results and fixtures[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Denmark national football team results (2020–present)\n\nThe following is a list of match results in the last 12 months, as well as any future matches that have been scheduled.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n## Home stadium[edit]\n\n\nFor stadium history, see Parken Stadium.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe **Denmark men's national football team** (Danish: *Danmarks herre-fodboldlandshold* or *herrelandsholdet*) represents Denmark and Greenland in men's international football competitions. It is controlled by the Danish Football Association (DBU), the governing body for the football clubs which are organised under DBU. Denmark's home stadium is Parken Stadium in the Østerbro district of Copenhagen; their head coach is Kasper Hjulmand.\n\n\nDenmark were the winners of the 1906 Intercalated Games football competition and silver medalists at the 1908 and 1912 Olympics. However, as amateurs who prohibited their internationals from becoming professionals at foreign clubs, Denmark did not qualify for the FIFA World Cup until 1986, although they won another Olympic silver in 1960.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nDenmark national football team\n |\n| --- |\n| General | * Danish Football Union\n* Managers\n |\n| Venues | * Parken Stadium\n* Idrætsparken\n |\n| Statistics | * Results\n\t+ 1908–1929\n\t+ 1930–1949\n\t+ 1950–1959\n\t+ 1960–1969\n\t+ 1970–1979\n\t+ 1980–1989\n\t+ 1990–1999\n\t+ 2000–2009\n\t+ 2010–2019\n\t+ 2020–present\n* Records and statistics\n |\n| Players | * Players with 25+ caps\n* 1–24 caps\n* All players\n |\n| Goals | * Poul Nielsen\n* Hat-tricks\n |\n| World Finals | * Summary\n* 1986\n* 1998\n* 2002\n* 2010\n* 2018\n* 2022\n |\n| European Finals | * Summary\n* 1964\n* 1984\n* 1988\n* **1992**\n* 1996\n* 2000\n* 2004\n* 2012\n* 2020\n* *2024*\n |\n| Culture | * Rivalry with Sweden\n\t+ abandoned Euro 2008 qualifier\n* Roligan\n* Landsholdet\n* 1960 air crash\n* Notable matches\n |\n| Other national teams | * Men's\n\t+ Under 17s\n\t+ Under 19s\n\t+ Under 21s\n\t+ Danish League XI\n* Women's\n\t+ Under 17s\n\t+ Under 19s\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe capacity of the stadium was later reduced to 38,009 seats after the upper part of the D-side was converted from 4,000 extra seats into office and VIP areas in June 2009.[71][72] Despite this decrease in capacity, the stadium is today still the biggest venue in Denmark by far; the next largest venue, Brøndby Stadium, only has a capacity of 26,000 seats. From September 1992 to May 2006, Parken was the sole stadium of all the men's senior national team matches. However, meagre spectator support at some of the friendly matches at Parken, which from 2000 to 2005 attracted an acceptable average of 23,862 per match – but down to 9,598 for the friendly 3–1 win over Israel in April 2002[73] – prompted the DBU to start hosting many of the friendly matches to other stadiums around Denmark. These other stadiums had less spectator capacity than Parken, but just about enough to cover the Danes' somewhat lesser interest for friendly matches.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n108. **^** SBU (2004). \"Players bonus (1st August 2004 to 31st July 2010)\".\n109. **^** \"Denmark\". *National Football Teams*.\n110. **^** As UEFA Euro 1992 Champions\n111. **^** TV2 Sporten (29 September 2009). \"Dynamit-holdet i Hall of Fame\" (in Danish).`{{cite web}}`: CS1 maint: numeric names: authors list (link)\n\n## Literature[edit]\n\n\n* Palle \"Banks\" Jørgensen (2002), \"*Landsholdets 681 profiler fra 1908 til i dag*\" (in Danish), TIPS-Bladet, ISBN 87-91264-01-4.\n\n\n## External links[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Denmark national association football team.\n\n* Official website\n* Denmark at FIFA\n* Denmark at UEFA\n* Official player and match statistics\n* Official league national team page (Archived 26 March 2010 at the Wayback Machine)\n* Official national team shop\n* De Danske Roligans (archived 11 June 2001)\n* National team, players and others (statistics)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 9 September 1992, the rebuilt Idrætsparken, now called **Parken** and later renamed **Telia Parken** for sponsorship reasons, became the biggest venue in Denmark with a capacity of 42,358 spectators, and was opened with a friendly 1–2 defeat against Germany.

Whenever another stadium than Idrætsparken was used for a home match, it was only for some of the less important friendly games or Olympic qualifiers. While only Idrætsparken was used to host the matches related to big important tournaments, like the Nordic championship, the UEFA European Championship and FIFA World Cup. When a major rebuild of Idrætsparken began in December 1990, the subsequent two official Euro 1992 qualification matches were moved to Odense Stadium in Odense.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn 27 May 2006, Parken's 13-year monopoly on national team matches was broken for the first time when Denmark played a friendly match at the Aarhus Idrætspark against upcoming 2006 World Cup participants Paraguay. Tickets to this match were sold out quickly, with almost 19,000 of the 20,227 tickets sold within the first hour of sale,[74] and was support-wise a big success with a total audience of 20,047 spectators.[75] When the two next friendly matches were played at some other new venues, 16 August at Fionia Park in Odense against Poland, and on 1 September at Brøndby Stadium against Portugal, the number of spectators dropped to a disappointing level. The Poland match attracted only 11,088 spectators,[76] while the Portugal match only 13,186 spectators.[77] In particular, the Portugal match was deemed as a support-wise failure because it featured a higher-ranked opponent, which spectators normally would have a high interest to watch. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n60. **^** Creditor, Avi (26 November 2022). \"Mbappe Dazzles vs. Denmark; France Clinches World Cup Last-16 Spot\". *Sports Illustrated*.
