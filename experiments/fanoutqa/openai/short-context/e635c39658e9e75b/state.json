On 13 February 2017 it was announced that he would be part of the line up for a week of gigs at the Royal Albert Hall in aid of the Teenage Cancer Trust taking place on 28 March 2017.[7] On 22 February 2017, Sheeran announced that Anne-Marie and Ryan McMullan would be the opening acts for the European dates.[8] On 8 March 2017, Sheeran announced the North American leg.[9] James Blunt was announced as the opening act, except for Indianapolis and Cleveland, where the opener was Joshua Radin. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLauv served as the opening act in Asia in November. On 28 June 2017, Sheeran announced a stadium tour across Europe. After the initial announcement, tickets sold quickly, which prompted new dates in Cork, Dublin, Manchester, Glasgow, Newcastle, London, Cardiff, Amsterdam, Paris, Gothenburg, Munich, Z\u00fcrich, Vienna, and Warsaw.[14] Anne-Marie returned as the opening act, while Jamie Lawson was added, and Beoga was added for Ireland. On 22 September 2017, Sheeran announced a stadium tour across North America.[15] On 6 February 2018, Sheeran added dates to the leg with new cities that were not in the initial announcement, and second shows in Toronto, Foxborough, and East Rutherford.[16] Snow Patrol was announced as the main opener for the North American stadium leg, along with Anne-Marie and Lauv in selected dates.[17] On 25 June 2018, Sheeran added two dates, performing in South Africa in March 2019.[18]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 19 September 2018, Sheeran added more 2019 dates to the tour, performing in stadiums across Europe and the UK, starting in May 2019. Due to high demand, numerous additional dates were added to the tour itinerary.\n\n\nSheeran later added even more 2019 dates to the Divide tour, performing in Brazil, Uruguay, and Argentina in February 2019. He also announced that he would be returning to Asia in April 2019, performing the long-awaited dates that were scheduled to take place in Fall 2017 but were cancelled and rescheduled due to bone fractures in the arms from a bike accident. The cities that were affected by the cancellation were Taipei, Seoul, Hong Kong and Jakarta. Sheeran will perform three Asia 2019 dates in Singapore, Seoul, and Bangkok. Sheeran later announced a second date in Cape Town, South Africa at Cape Town Stadium, scheduled for 28 March 2019. On 28 November, Sheeran added dates in Tokyo, Osaka, and Jakarta.

Sheeran also broke records for the biggest stadium tour of Australia and New Zealand, venue record for highest cumulative attendance on one tour and venue record for highest attendance for a single show.[23] More than 710,000 tickets were sold within a single day of general public sale. In Sydney, a total of 243,513 tickets were sold for three shows at the ANZ Stadium, which rolled out over three successive nights from 15 to 17 March 2018. The attendance per show was 79,726, 81,752 and 82,035, respectively. This set a new record for aggregate attendance at a series of stadium concerts in NSW, smashing the old benchmark of 213,045 set by AC/DC during their Black Ice World Tour in 2010.[24]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn 10 May 2017, Sheeran announced the Oceanian leg.[10] The tour was originally slated to have seven shows, but demand was high, the leg became eighteen shows.[11] On 8 June 2017, Sheeran announced the Asian leg of the tour, which was originally planned for October 2017 until November 2017.[12] However, due to bone fractures in his arms from a bike accident, he had to postpone and cancel parts of the Asian leg.

The stadium has 43,230 seats and is located in the centre of Sofia, on the territory of the city's oldest and most famous park - the Borisova gradina.\nThe Bulgaria national football team's home matches and the Bulgarian Cup finals are held at the venue, as well as athletics competitions. It was used as the home venue for Levski Sofia's Champions League games, and is often used for important derbies between the big clubs from Sofia, instead of their own home stadiums.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nVasil Levski National Stadium was officially opened in 1953, extended in 1966 and renovated in 2002.\n\n\nPrior to their demolition by the Communist authorities during the 1940s and 50s, two other stadiums stood on the ground where the current national stadium lies. One of those was Levski Sofia's club stadium, called Levski Field (Bulgarian: *Igrishte Levski*, completed 1934), and the other - the Yunak Stadium (built 1928), which lay partially to the southwest. The latter used to host national football team matches with its capacity of about 15,000 seats. Levski were never compensated for their loss. During the 1960s, they build a new stadium - the present day Georgi Asparuhov.\n\n\nThe Vasil Levski stadium was completed in 1953 with an announced capacity of 42,000.[2] Originally, only the lower tier of stands was built (roughly half the height of the current stands), and, due to the uneven lie of the land, the western end of the pitch and stands were below ground level.[3] \nThe upper tier was built about a decade later, with the current floodlight towers built in the late 1960s.\n\n\nThe Vasil Levski stadium was used for athletics competitions immediately after its official opening on 5 July 1953. The first football match played there after its opening was a friendly between Dinamo Sofia and FC Wien and, a month later, it also began being used for league games. The first international was a world cup qualifier on 6 September against Czechoslovakia.[4]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nThe stadium offers also judo, artistic gymnastics, basketball, boxing, aerobics, fencing and table tennis halls, as well as a general physical training hall, two conference halls and three restaurants.\nIt hosted the 1957 European basketball championship.[5]\n\n\nIt was the proposed venue for the Opening and Closing Ceremonies in Sofia's bid for the 2014 Winter Olympics.\n\n\nIn July 2011, plans were announced to build a new 40,000 all-seater national stadium in the Sofia suburbs, but was later scrapped.\n\n\n\n## Concert venue[edit]\n\n\nThe stadium has hosted music shows by a number of regional and world stars.\n\n\nThe biggest concert in Bulgaria ever and thus at the Vasil Levski stadium was held by Yugoslav superstar Lepa Brena on 24 July 1990 in front of 100,000 people.[6] This record remains unbroken to date. The curiosity of the concert was the way Lepa Brena arrived at the stadium - by landing from the helicopter directly to the stage with a rope.\n\n\nAmerican metal band Metallica held one of the most successful concerts in Bulgaria in the stadium as part of their 2008 European Vacation Tour, attracting 50,000 people.[7]\n\n\nAmerican superstar Madonna had a very successful concert here as part of the second European second leg of her Sticky & Sweet Tour on 29 August 2009. She performed in front of 54,000 people [8][*citation needed*] and was warmly welcomed by her numerous fans. After the show, the grass was badly damaged, which caused some discontent amongst football fans, national team players, coaches and staff.\n\n\nOn 14 May 2010, Australian rock band AC/DC played the Bulgarian capital Sofia, in front of nearly 60,000 fans as part of their Black Ice World Tour.\n\n\nA festival, under the name *Sofia Rocks*, part of Sonisphere Festival took place on the Vasil Levski National Stadium. The festival was held over 2 days on 22 and 23 June with live performances by world-renowned bands such as Rammstein, Metallica, Manowar and Alice in Chains among others.\n\n\nThe Big Four, Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, and Anthrax, performed all together during the Sonisphere Festival. The performance at the Sonisphere Festival in Sofia was beamed to more than 450 movie theatres in more than 140 markets in the U.S. and select cities in Europe, Canada and South America on 22 June 2010. The live video was later released on DVD and Blu-ray in October 2010, entitled *The Big 4 Live from Sofia, Bulgaria*.\n\n\nOn 30 October, the North American rock band Bon Jovi announced that they will perform live at Levski during their Because We Can tour on 14 May 2013.[*needs update*]\n\n\nOn 30 July 2023, the North American pop rock band Imagine Dragons performed live at Levski as part of their Mercury World Tour\n\n\n\n## Concerts[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Concerts at Vasil Levski National Stadium\n |\n| --- |\n| Date | Artist | Tour | Attendance\n |\n| 24 July 1990\n | Lepa Brena | \u2014\n | 120,000\n |\n| 14 September 2006\n | Ceca | Grom Tour\n | 5,000\n |\n| 2 October 2003\n | Azis | \u2014\n | 50,000\n |\n| 24 July 2008\n | Metallica | 2008 European Vacation Tour | 50,000\n |\n| 29 August 2009\n | Madonna | Sticky & Sweet Tour | 53,660\n |\n| 14 May 2010\n | AC/DC | Black Ice World Tour | 60,000\n |\n| 22 June 2010\n | Megadeth, Anthrax, Slayer, Metallica | Sonisphere Festival | 50,000\n |\n| 23 June 2010\n | Rammstein | Liebe ist f\u00fcr alle da Tour | 35,000\n |\n| 8 July 2012\n | Guns N' Roses | Up Close and Personal Tour | N/A\n |\n| 14 May 2013\n | Bon Jovi | Because We Can: The Tour | 47,266\n |\n| 26 July 2013\n | Rammstein | Made in Germany 1995\u20132011 (tour) | N/A\n |\n| 30 August 2013\n | Roger Waters | The Wall Live (concert tour) | 31,371\n |\n| 25 September 2015\n | Slavi Trifonov | \u2014\n | 70,000\n |\n| 30 July 2023\n | Imagine Dragons | Mercury World Tour | 44,000\n |\n| 31 August 2024\n | Ed Sheeran | +\u2013=\u00f7\u00d7 Tour |  |\n\n\n## Location[edit]\n\n\nThe stadium is located in the city centre.

This came after the original hosts, Sweden, did not classify esports as a sporting event, making it more difficult for players to procure visas to the country.[13]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Romania-France opening match\n![](image)2012 UEFA Europa League Final\nThe official inauguration was initially scheduled for 10 August 2011, and was to feature a football match between Romania and Argentina.[14] However, on 26 July, Argentina officially cancelled the friendly match after their manager Sergio Batista departed the team. \n\n\nThe stadium was inaugurated on 6 September 2011, with a UEFA Euro 2012 Group D qualifier match between Romania and France.[15] In the front of 49,137 fans, Romania and France drew 0-0. The result meant that Romania lost any chance of qualifying for the tournament, hosted by neighbours Ukraine and Poland.\n\n\n\n### Notable attendances[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

The entire project, which would arrange the area of 88\u00a0ha (220 acres) between the Branko's Bridge and Hotel Jugoslavija, is based on the ideas of Jan Gehl. The entire project is to be finished by 2020. Park will be divided in 7 zones. Two zones closer to Zemun and Zemunski Kej will be \"Movement\" 1,280\u00a0m2 (13,800\u00a0sq\u00a0ft) and \"Nature\" 763\u00a0m2 (8,210\u00a0sq\u00a0ft).[13]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**U\u0161\u0107e** (Serbian Cyrillic: \u0423\u0448\u045b\u0435; pronounced [\u00fb\u02d0\u0283t\u0361\u0255e]) is an urban neighborhood of Belgrade, the capital of Serbia. It is located in Belgrade's municipality of Novi Beograd. U\u0161\u0107e is located on the mouth of the Sava river into the Danube, thus the name (*u\u0161\u0107e* is Serbian for *confluence*). It occupies Novi Beograd's Blocks 10, 13, 14, 15 and 16 on the Sava's left and the Danube's right bank, covering a tip of land that overlooks the islands of Little War Island and Great War Island to the north and the old core of Belgrade, the fortress of Kalemegdan to the west. U\u0161\u0107e borders the neighborhoods of Staro Sajmi\u0161te and Savograd on the south. As a compact grassy and forested area it stretches along the bank of the Danube into the Block 10, to the Zemun municipality and the Hotel Jugoslavija and the ENJUB shopping mall.\n\n\nSpanning over 0.52 square kilometres (0.20\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), Park U\u0161\u0107e is the largest official park area in Belgrade.[1]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Nica Beach[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn September 2018, Belgrade's mayor Zoran Radoji\u010di\u0107 announced that the construction of a dam on the Danube, in the Zemun-New Belgrade area, will start soon. The dam should protect the city during the high water levels.[10][11] Such project was never mentioned before, nor it was clear how and where it will be constructed, or if it's feasible at all. Radoji\u010di\u0107 clarified after a while that he was referring to the temporary, mobile flood wall. The wall will be 50\u00a0cm (20\u00a0in) high and 5\u00a0km (3.1\u00a0mi) long, stretching from the Branko's Bridge across the Sava and the neighborhood of U\u0161\u0107e, to the *Radecki* restaurant on the Danube's bank in the Zemun's Gardo\u0161 neighborhood. In the case of emergency, the panels will be placed on the existing construction. The construction is scheduled to start in 2019 and to finish in 2020.[12]\n\n\n\n## Park U\u0161\u0107e[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe estimated value of the project is 30 million euros.[57] In June 2018, Nikola Nikodijevi\u0107, president of the Belgrade City hall, announced that construction should start in 2020.[58]\n\n\nAdditionally, Mar\u010deti\u0107 and Maksimovi\u0107 also envisioned four 24-story skyscrapers west of the Palace Serbia, between the new Philharmonic and the YU Business Center shopping mall. The proposed skyscrapers will have a total floor area of 200,000\u00a0m2 (2,200,000\u00a0sq\u00a0ft) and a two-level underground garage with 47,000\u00a0m2 (510,000\u00a0sq\u00a0ft).[57]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMayor Sini\u0161a Mali claimed the money for the project, 200 million dinars, has already been marked in the city budget, due to the previous \"savings\". Asked how is that a priority when one third of Belgrade still has no sewage system, Mali said that both the sewage and the mast are needed. Dragoljub Baki\u0107, member of the Serbian Academy of Architecture, said that the city government treats Belgrade as the \"prey\" they won, labeling their politics as an \"urban reality show as they bomb us every day with some other nonsense\".[14][15] Baki\u0107 also criticized the parceling and concreting of the park area.[16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n25. **^** Branka Vasiljevi\u0107, Daliborka Mu\u010dibabi\u0107 (13 March 2019). \"Zbog gondola Kalemegdan \u2013 U\u0161\u0107e seku 155 stabala\" [Because of the Kalemegdan-U\u0161\u0107e gondola lift, they are cutting 155 trees]. *Politika* (in Serbian). p.\u00a016.\n26. **^** Dejan Aleksi\u0107 (14 March 2019). \"Se\u010da stabala na U\u0161\u0107u i Kalemegdana\" [Cutting of the trees in U\u0161\u0107e and Kalemegdan]. *Politika* (in Serbian). p.\u00a015.\n27. **^** Jelena D.

Another monumental building is the U\u0161\u0107e Tower, with 134 m(antenna) of height almost tallest building in the Balkans (it was second tallest before the NATO attack on Serbia in 1999 when Avala TV Tower just outside Belgrade was razed). Third important building is the Museum of Contemporary Art, close to Sava river's left bank.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nConstruction of the gondola lift was confirmed in March 2018 when the idea of a pedestrian bridge was dropped after it has been described as \"complicated\" and \"unstable\". On the Kalemegdan side, the station will be dug into the hill, 1\u00a0m (3\u00a0ft 3\u00a0in) below the fortress' Sava Promenade. On the U\u0161\u0107\u0435 side, the starting point will be next to the Skate Park, across the U\u0161\u0107e Tower. The entire route is 1\u00a0km (0.62\u00a0mi) long, of which 300\u00a0m (980\u00a0ft) will be above the Sava river itself. Estimated cost is \u20ac10 million and duration of works 18 months, but it is still not known when the construction will begin.[21] The criticism of the project continued, from the officially used name (*gondola* instead of a traditional Serbian *\u017ei\u010dara*) and chosen location, to the route, especially the Kalemegdan station.[16][22] Several reports were filed against the people involved in the project, but the state didn't act upon any of them. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n48. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Daliborka Mu\u010dibabi\u0107 (13 September 2019). \"Ispod Brankovog mosta \u2013 muzeji automobila i MUP-a\" [Museums of automobiles and Ministry of the Interior under the Branko's Bridge]. *Politika* (in Serbian). p.\u00a016.\n49. **^** \u0110.A.

They will cover 2,800\u00a0m2 (30,000\u00a0sq\u00a0ft) and some works in it started immediately. For 2018, Mali announced the construction of the gondola lift, which will connect the geographical tip of U\u0161\u0107e with Kalemegdan, and of a giant Ferris wheel across the Great War Island. He confirmed the erection of a tall flagmast.[13]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe flagmast was already brought up before. Without any previous public mention of the project, Mali announced on 26 June 2017 construction of the 120-metre-high (394\u00a0ft) flagmast in U\u0161\u0107e, which would hold the Serbian flag, 20\u00a0m (66\u00a0ft) by 30\u00a0m (98\u00a0ft). He already declared it a symbol of Belgrade which would bring many tourists who will take photos with the mast, which is \"important for the entire Serbia\" and will make Belgrade a modern and more beautiful city. He also added that the project is an \"initiative of president Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107\".[14][15]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n12. **^** Dejan Aleksi\u0107 (22 September 2018). \"Umesto d\u017eakova, mobilna brana protiv poplava\" [Mobile dam against the flood, instead of sandbags]. *Politika* (in Serbian).\n13. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Daliborka Mu\u010dibabi\u0107 (25 August 2017), \"Srpski Central park na U\u0161\u0107u\", *Politika* (in Serbian), p.\u00a016\n14. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Maja Nikoli\u0107 (26 June 2017). \"Arhitekta Baki\u0107: Jarbol od 120m jo\u0161 jedna urbana hajdu\u010dija\" (in Serbian).

Idea was later dropped.[35] As of 2018, the Eternal Flame monument still has no necessary permits and is technically illegally built.[24]\n\n\nAn area of 14\u00a0ha (35 acres) within the park, the Peace Alley, has been declared an \"important place\"\u00a0[sr].[24] The park was fully renovated from September 2018 to March 2019.[36]\n\n\n\n## Features[edit]\n\n\n### Buildings[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Palace of Serbia; U\u0161\u0107e Tower; and Museum of Contemporary Art, Belgrade\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Map of Local communities in Novi Beograd\nLike all of Novi Beograd, U\u0161\u0107e is flat, and without buildings to hide that fact like in the rest of the municipality, that is quite obvious here. With only three buildings and several smaller edifices, U\u0161\u0107e is the least urbanized section of Novi Beograd but some residential blocks are administratively attached to the local community of the same name, which had the population of 9,991 in 2011.\n\n\nU\u0161\u0107e is a vast grassy and forested area 2.5\u00a0km \u00d7\u00a01\u00a0km (1.55\u00a0mi \u00d7\u00a00.62\u00a0mi) along the river banks. As such, it is used by many Belgraders as a recreational area or as a place for organizing political gatherings or musical concerts. However, many areas are not cultivated, but left to grow wild. During the high levels of the Danube and the Sava, bank areas are always flooded.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn September 2019 it was announced that the Ministry of the Interior's open garage under the Branko's Bridge will be adapted into the Museum of automobiles and Museum of the Ministry of the Interior. The project also includes plans for the adjoining tracks in U\u0161\u0107e to be used for revue races organized by the new museum.[48]\n\n\n\n### Skatepark[edit]\n\n\nAfter 20 years of skateboarders' activism to get one, the first skatepark in this part of Europe was opened on 28 September 2008. It is located in the Block 15, across the U\u0161\u0107e Tower and covers an area of 2,200\u00a0m2 (24,000\u00a0sq\u00a0ft), which made it the largest one in the region when opened. Originally, it had 15 elements but after the 2011 reconstruction, 6 new elements were added. Apart from the everyday use (entrance is free for everyone with skateboards, rollers and bicycles), local and international competitions are being held at the park.[49][50][51]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
