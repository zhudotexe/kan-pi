The stadium has 43,230 seats and is located in the centre of Sofia, on the territory of the city's oldest and most famous park - the Borisova gradina.\nThe Bulgaria national football team's home matches and the Bulgarian Cup finals are held at the venue, as well as athletics competitions. It was used as the home venue for Levski Sofia's Champions League games, and is often used for important derbies between the big clubs from Sofia, instead of their own home stadiums.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nVasil Levski National Stadium was officially opened in 1953, extended in 1966 and renovated in 2002.\n\n\nPrior to their demolition by the Communist authorities during the 1940s and 50s, two other stadiums stood on the ground where the current national stadium lies. One of those was Levski Sofia's club stadium, called Levski Field (Bulgarian: *Igrishte Levski*, completed 1934), and the other - the Yunak Stadium (built 1928), which lay partially to the southwest. The latter used to host national football team matches with its capacity of about 15,000 seats. Levski were never compensated for their loss. During the 1960s, they build a new stadium - the present day Georgi Asparuhov.\n\n\nThe Vasil Levski stadium was completed in 1953 with an announced capacity of 42,000.[2] Originally, only the lower tier of stands was built (roughly half the height of the current stands), and, due to the uneven lie of the land, the western end of the pitch and stands were below ground level.[3] \nThe upper tier was built about a decade later, with the current floodlight towers built in the late 1960s.\n\n\nThe Vasil Levski stadium was used for athletics competitions immediately after its official opening on 5 July 1953. The first football match played there after its opening was a friendly between Dinamo Sofia and FC Wien and, a month later, it also began being used for league games. The first international was a world cup qualifier on 6 September against Czechoslovakia.[4]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nThe stadium offers also judo, artistic gymnastics, basketball, boxing, aerobics, fencing and table tennis halls, as well as a general physical training hall, two conference halls and three restaurants.\nIt hosted the 1957 European basketball championship.[5]\n\n\nIt was the proposed venue for the Opening and Closing Ceremonies in Sofia's bid for the 2014 Winter Olympics.\n\n\nIn July 2011, plans were announced to build a new 40,000 all-seater national stadium in the Sofia suburbs, but was later scrapped.\n\n\n\n## Concert venue[edit]\n\n\nThe stadium has hosted music shows by a number of regional and world stars.\n\n\nThe biggest concert in Bulgaria ever and thus at the Vasil Levski stadium was held by Yugoslav superstar Lepa Brena on 24 July 1990 in front of 100,000 people.[6] This record remains unbroken to date. The curiosity of the concert was the way Lepa Brena arrived at the stadium - by landing from the helicopter directly to the stage with a rope.\n\n\nAmerican metal band Metallica held one of the most successful concerts in Bulgaria in the stadium as part of their 2008 European Vacation Tour, attracting 50,000 people.[7]\n\n\nAmerican superstar Madonna had a very successful concert here as part of the second European second leg of her Sticky & Sweet Tour on 29 August 2009. She performed in front of 54,000 people [8][*citation needed*] and was warmly welcomed by her numerous fans. After the show, the grass was badly damaged, which caused some discontent amongst football fans, national team players, coaches and staff.\n\n\nOn 14 May 2010, Australian rock band AC/DC played the Bulgarian capital Sofia, in front of nearly 60,000 fans as part of their Black Ice World Tour.\n\n\nA festival, under the name *Sofia Rocks*, part of Sonisphere Festival took place on the Vasil Levski National Stadium. The festival was held over 2 days on 22 and 23 June with live performances by world-renowned bands such as Rammstein, Metallica, Manowar and Alice in Chains among others.\n\n\nThe Big Four, Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, and Anthrax, performed all together during the Sonisphere Festival. The performance at the Sonisphere Festival in Sofia was beamed to more than 450 movie theatres in more than 140 markets in the U.S. and select cities in Europe, Canada and South America on 22 June 2010. The live video was later released on DVD and Blu-ray in October 2010, entitled *The Big 4 Live from Sofia, Bulgaria*.\n\n\nOn 30 October, the North American rock band Bon Jovi announced that they will perform live at Levski during their Because We Can tour on 14 May 2013.[*needs update*]\n\n\nOn 30 July 2023, the North American pop rock band Imagine Dragons performed live at Levski as part of their Mercury World Tour\n\n\n\n## Concerts[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Concerts at Vasil Levski National Stadium\n |\n| --- |\n| Date | Artist | Tour | Attendance\n |\n| 24 July 1990\n | Lepa Brena | —\n | 120,000\n |\n| 14 September 2006\n | Ceca | Grom Tour\n | 5,000\n |\n| 2 October 2003\n | Azis | —\n | 50,000\n |\n| 24 July 2008\n | Metallica | 2008 European Vacation Tour | 50,000\n |\n| 29 August 2009\n | Madonna | Sticky & Sweet Tour | 53,660\n |\n| 14 May 2010\n | AC/DC | Black Ice World Tour | 60,000\n |\n| 22 June 2010\n | Megadeth, Anthrax, Slayer, Metallica | Sonisphere Festival | 50,000\n |\n| 23 June 2010\n | Rammstein | Liebe ist für alle da Tour | 35,000\n |\n| 8 July 2012\n | Guns N' Roses | Up Close and Personal Tour | N/A\n |\n| 14 May 2013\n | Bon Jovi | Because We Can: The Tour | 47,266\n |\n| 26 July 2013\n | Rammstein | Made in Germany 1995–2011 (tour) | N/A\n |\n| 30 August 2013\n | Roger Waters | The Wall Live (concert tour) | 31,371\n |\n| 25 September 2015\n | Slavi Trifonov | —\n | 70,000\n |\n| 30 July 2023\n | Imagine Dragons | Mercury World Tour | 44,000\n |\n| 31 August 2024\n | Ed Sheeran | +–=÷× Tour |  |\n\n\n## Location[edit]\n\n\nThe stadium is located in the city centre.

On 24 August 2017, the mayor of Belgrade, Siniša Mali, announced a massive works in the park which would, as he described it, look like a Central Park in New York City or a Gorky Park in Moscow. The entire project, which would arrange the area of 88 ha (220 acres) between the Branko's Bridge and Hotel Jugoslavija, is based on the ideas of Jan Gehl. The entire project is to be finished by 2020. Park will be divided in 7 zones. Two zones closer to Zemun and Zemunski Kej will be \"Movement\" 1,280 m2 (13,800 sq ft) and \"Nature\" 763 m2 (8,210 sq ft).[13]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Ušće** (Serbian Cyrillic: Ушће; pronounced [ûːʃt͡ɕe]) is an urban neighborhood of Belgrade, the capital of Serbia. It is located in Belgrade's municipality of Novi Beograd. Ušće is located on the mouth of the Sava river into the Danube, thus the name (*ušće* is Serbian for *confluence*). It occupies Novi Beograd's Blocks 10, 13, 14, 15 and 16 on the Sava's left and the Danube's right bank, covering a tip of land that overlooks the islands of Little War Island and Great War Island to the north and the old core of Belgrade, the fortress of Kalemegdan to the west. Ušće borders the neighborhoods of Staro Sajmište and Savograd on the south. As a compact grassy and forested area it stretches along the bank of the Danube into the Block 10, to the Zemun municipality and the Hotel Jugoslavija and the ENJUB shopping mall.\n\n\nSpanning over 0.52 square kilometres (0.20 sq mi), Park Ušće is the largest official park area in Belgrade.[1]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Nica Beach[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn September 2018, Belgrade's mayor Zoran Radojičić announced that the construction of a dam on the Danube, in the Zemun-New Belgrade area, will start soon. The dam should protect the city during the high water levels.[10][11] Such project was never mentioned before, nor it was clear how and where it will be constructed, or if it's feasible at all. Radojičić clarified after a while that he was referring to the temporary, mobile flood wall. The wall will be 50 cm (20 in) high and 5 km (3.1 mi) long, stretching from the Branko's Bridge across the Sava and the neighborhood of Ušće, to the *Radecki* restaurant on the Danube's bank in the Zemun's Gardoš neighborhood. In the case of emergency, the panels will be placed on the existing construction. The construction is scheduled to start in 2019 and to finish in 2020.[12]\n\n\n\n## Park Ušće[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe estimated value of the project is 30 million euros.[57] In June 2018, Nikola Nikodijević, president of the Belgrade City hall, announced that construction should start in 2020.[58]\n\n\nAdditionally, Marčetić and Maksimović also envisioned four 24-story skyscrapers west of the Palace Serbia, between the new Philharmonic and the YU Business Center shopping mall. The proposed skyscrapers will have a total floor area of 200,000 m2 (2,200,000 sq ft) and a two-level underground garage with 47,000 m2 (510,000 sq ft).[57]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMayor Siniša Mali claimed the money for the project, 200 million dinars, has already been marked in the city budget, due to the previous \"savings\". Asked how is that a priority when one third of Belgrade still has no sewage system, Mali said that both the sewage and the mast are needed. Dragoljub Bakić, member of the Serbian Academy of Architecture, said that the city government treats Belgrade as the \"prey\" they won, labeling their politics as an \"urban reality show as they bomb us every day with some other nonsense\".[14][15] Bakić also criticized the parceling and concreting of the park area.[16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n25. **^** Branka Vasiljević, Daliborka Mučibabić (13 March 2019). \"Zbog gondola Kalemegdan – Ušće seku 155 stabala\" [Because of the Kalemegdan-Ušće gondola lift, they are cutting 155 trees]. *Politika* (in Serbian). p. 16.\n26. **^** Dejan Aleksić (14 March 2019). \"Seča stabala na Ušću i Kalemegdana\" [Cutting of the trees in Ušće and Kalemegdan]. *Politika* (in Serbian). p. 15.\n27. **^** Jelena D.

Another monumental building is the Ušće Tower, with 134 m(antenna) of height almost tallest building in the Balkans (it was second tallest before the NATO attack on Serbia in 1999 when Avala TV Tower just outside Belgrade was razed). Third important building is the Museum of Contemporary Art, close to Sava river's left bank.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nConstruction of the gondola lift was confirmed in March 2018 when the idea of a pedestrian bridge was dropped after it has been described as \"complicated\" and \"unstable\". On the Kalemegdan side, the station will be dug into the hill, 1 m (3 ft 3 in) below the fortress' Sava Promenade. On the Ušćе side, the starting point will be next to the Skate Park, across the Ušće Tower. The entire route is 1 km (0.62 mi) long, of which 300 m (980 ft) will be above the Sava river itself. Estimated cost is €10 million and duration of works 18 months, but it is still not known when the construction will begin.[21] The criticism of the project continued, from the officially used name (*gondola* instead of a traditional Serbian *žičara*) and chosen location, to the route, especially the Kalemegdan station.[16][22] Several reports were filed against the people involved in the project, but the state didn't act upon any of them. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n48. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Daliborka Mučibabić (13 September 2019). \"Ispod Brankovog mosta – muzeji automobila i MUP-a\" [Museums of automobiles and Ministry of the Interior under the Branko's Bridge]. *Politika* (in Serbian). p. 16.\n49. **^** Đ.A.

They will cover 2,800 m2 (30,000 sq ft) and some works in it started immediately. For 2018, Mali announced the construction of the gondola lift, which will connect the geographical tip of Ušće with Kalemegdan, and of a giant Ferris wheel across the Great War Island.

He already declared it a symbol of Belgrade which would bring many tourists who will take photos with the mast, which is \"important for the entire Serbia\" and will make Belgrade a modern and more beautiful city.

As such, it is used by many Belgraders as a recreational area or as a place for organizing political gatherings or musical concerts. However, many areas are not cultivated, but left to grow wild.
