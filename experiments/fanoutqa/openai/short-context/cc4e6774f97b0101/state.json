The Prussian-led North German Confederation (1866-1871) subsequently morphed into a modern nation state, the German Reich, which was ruled by emperors from 1871 to the collapse of all German monarchies in 1918.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | Honecker, Erich**Erich Honecker**(1912\u20131994) | 29 October 1976 | 18 October 1989(*resigned*) | 12\u00a0years, 354\u00a0days |  | SED |\n| ![Egon Krenz](image)\n | Krenz, Egon**Egon Krenz**(born 1937) | 18 October 1989 | 6 December 1989(*resigned*) | 49\u00a0days |  | SED |\n| ![Manfred Gerlach](image)\n | Gerlach, Manfred**Manfred Gerlach**(1928\u20132011) | 6 December 1989 | 5 April 1990(*office abolished*) | 120\u00a0days |  | LDPD |\n| President of the People's Chamber*Pr\u00e4sident der Volkskammer* |\n| ![Sabine Bergmann-Pohl](image)\n | Bergmann-Pohl, Sabine**Sabine Bergmann-Pohl**(born 1946) | 5 April 1990 | 2 October 1990(*East Germany joined Federal Republic*) | 180\u00a0days |  | CDU |\n\n\n## Styles of the Heads of State[edit]\n\n\nUnified state (1871 to 1945)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Portrait\n | Bundespr\u00e4sident | Took office | Left office | Time in office | Party | Election\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![Theodor Heuss](image)\n | Heuss, Theodor**Theodor Heuss**(1884\u20131963) | 13 September 1949 | 12 September 1959 | 9\u00a0years, 364\u00a0days |  | FDP | 19491954 |\n| ![Heinrich L\u00fcbke](image)\n | L\u00fcbke, Heinrich**Heinrich L\u00fcbke**(1894\u20131972) | 13 September 1959 | 30 June 1969(*resigned*) | 9\u00a0years, 290\u00a0days |  | CDU | 19591964 |\n| ![Gustav Heinemann](image)\n | Heinemann, Gustav**Gustav Heinemann**(1899\u20131976) | 1 July 1969 | 30 June 1974 | 4\u00a0years, 364\u00a0days |  | SPD | 1969 |\n| ![Walter Scheel](image)\n | Scheel, Walter**Walter Scheel**(1919\u20132016) | 1 July 1974 | 30 June 1979 | 4\u00a0years, 364\u00a0days |  | FDP | 1974 |\n| ![Karl Carstens](image)\n | Carstens, Karl**Karl Carstens**(1914\u20131992) | 1 July 1979 | 30 June 1984 | 4\u00a0years, 365\u00a0days |  | CDU | 1979 |\n| ![Richard von Weizs\u00e4cker](image)\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

The first to take the title was Odoacer, a barbarian military leader, in the late 5th century, followed by the Ostrogothic kings up to the mid-6th century. With the Frankish conquest of Italy in the 8th century, the Carolingians assumed the title, which was maintained by subsequent Holy Roman Emperors throughout the Middle Ages. The last Emperor to claim the title was Charles V in the 16th century. During this period, the holders of the title were crowned with the Iron Crown of Lombardy.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| No.\n | Portrait\n | Name\n | Term\n | Tenure\n | Election YearVoter Percentage\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **\u2014** | ![](image) | **Alcide De Gasperi**(1881\u20131954) | **\u2014** | 12 June1946\n | 1 July1946\n | \u2014\n |\n| He exercised the powers of Provisional Head of State as Prime Minister between the departure of King Umberto II on 12 June 1946, and the proclamation of Enrico De Nicola as Head of State by the Constituent Assembly |\n| **1** | ![](image) | **Enrico De Nicola**(1877\u20131959) | **1** | 1 July1946\n | 25 June1947\n | 1946 \u2014 78.57%396\n |\n| **2** | 26 June1947\n | 1 January1948\n | 1947 \u2014 93.96%405\n |\n|  |\n\n\n## Presidents[edit]\n\n\nUnder the Constitution, the first constitution of the Republic of Italy, the President replaced the monarch as ceremonial head of state.

His father, Prince Albert, Prince of Li\u00e8ge (later King Albert II), was the second son of King Leopold III of Belgium and a younger brother of Baudouin. His mother, Paola, Princess of Li\u00e8ge (later Queen Paola), is a daughter of the Italian aristocrat Fulco VIII, Prince Ruffo di Calabria, 6th Duke of Guardia Lombarda. His mother descends from the French House of La Fayette, and the king is a descendant of Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette, and Marie Adrienne Fran\u00e7oise de Noailles.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nPhilippe was baptised one month later at the church of Saint Jacques-sur-Coudenberg in Brussels on 17 May,[1] and named Philippe after his great-great-grandfather Prince Philippe, Count of Flanders. His godparents were his paternal grandfather, King Leopold III, and his maternal grandmother, Donna Luisa, Princess Ruffo di Calabria.[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** J.M.

The child neglect was so severe that child psychologist Peter Adriaenssens\u00a0[nl] described it as justifying intervention by social workers.[3]\n\n\nPhilippe has a half-sibling, Princess Delphine of Belgium (born 1968).\n\n\nHe was also the fifth cousin of the late Queen Elizabeth II since they share a common ancestor, Francis (one of his sons, Leopold I would become the first King of the Belgians while his eldest son and successor, Ernest I is the father-in-law of Queen Victoria).

The arms of the reigning monarch was modified to include the Saxonian escutcheon. The arms of other members of the royal family was similarly modified.[20][21] The reinstatement of the shield of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha into the royal arms occurred shortly after the visit of the king and queen to the ancestral Friedenstein Castle. The latest royal decree therefore reverses previous changes made to the Royal versions of the coat arms which removed the armorial bearings of Saxony during the First World War.[22] By including the three official languages in the motto it reflects his wish \"to be the King of the whole Kingdom and of all Belgians\".[23]\nAdopted\n12 July 2019\nCoronet\nRoyal crown of Belgium\nHelm\nA golden royal helm with the visor open\nEscutcheon\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |\n|  |\n|  | 15.

His mother, born in Breslau (now Wroc\u0142aw, Poland), came as a refugee from a Lutheran part of Silesia during the flight and expulsion of Germans after World War II.[11]\n\n\nFollowing his *Abitur*, Steinmeier did his military service from 1974 to 1976, then studied law and political science at the Justus Liebig University Giessen, where Brigitte Zypries was a fellow student.[12] In 1982 he passed his first and in 1986 his second state examination in law. Steinmeier worked as a scientific assistant to the professor of public law and political science at Giessen University until he obtained his doctorate of law in 1991. His dissertation explored the state's role in preventing homelessness.[13]\n\n\n\n### Family life[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPresident Joachim Gauck announced in June 2016 that he would not run for re-election, resulting in a search for a candidate to succeed him.[136] In November 2016, Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives agreed with the Social Democrats to support Steinmeier's candidacy for president in the presidential election, scheduled for 12 February 2017.[137]\n\n\nMerkel had originally wanted to nominate Green politician Marianne Birthler, and as the CDU/CSU and the Greens control a majority in the Federal Convention, Birthler's election would have been secured. However, Birthler after some time decided not to run.[138]\n\n\nOn 12 February 2017 Germany's 16th Federal Convention elected Steinmeier President on the first ballot, with 931 votes out of a total of 1,260.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSteinmeier is married and has one daughter. On 24 August 2010, he donated a kidney to his wife, Elke B\u00fcdenbender.[14]\n\n\nIn 2015, Steinmeier served as best man at the wedding of R\u00fcdiger Grube and Cornelia Poletto in Hamburg.[15]\n\n\n\n### Interests[edit]\n\n\nSteinmeier enjoys jazz, and is an avid football fan.[16]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nSteinmeier is a Reformed Protestant and an active member of the Reformed Bethlehem congregation in Berlin-Neuk\u00f6lln.[17] He was baptized into his father's church (the Church of Lippe) as a youth.\n\n\n\n### Early career[edit]\n\n\nSteinmeier became an adviser in 1991 for Law of Communication media and media guidelines in the State Chancellery of Lower Saxony in Hanover. In 1993, he became director of the Personal Office for the prime minister of Lower Saxony, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der. In 1996, he became the Secretary of State and head of the State Chancellery of Lower Saxony.\n\n\n\n## Political career on federal level[edit]\n\n\n### Schr\u00f6der Federal Chancellery, 1998\u20132005[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the following weeks, Steinmeier played an important role in the formation of the next government. This is because if the Bundestag fails to elect a chancellor in 14 days of voting,[141] the president can either appoint the individual with most votes to lead a minority government or dissolve the Bundestag and call new elections. This type of political crisis had never been seen in Germany before and pushed the president into a quite powerful position which is rare for Germany. Steinmeier declared he would not consider a dissolution of the Bundestag as a preferable solution, and managed to persuade Schulz to meet with Angela Merkel and start preliminary talks. After long coalition talks, CDU, CSU and SPD formed a new grand coalition. Merkel was re-elected in the Bundestag on 14 March 2018.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### 2022 re-election[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Steinmeier with Finnish prime minister Sanna Marin in Helsinki, April 2022\nOn 13 February 2022 he was re-elected as president.[142]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n9. **^** Judy Dempsey (17 October 2005), \"A promotion to cabinet for Schr\u00f6der's top aide\". *The New York Times*.\n10. **^** Alex Grimm (10 February 2009). \"To be perfectly Frank... minister shortens name\". *Reuters*.\n11. **^** \"Das Ehepaar Steinmeier \u00fcber das \u00f6kumenische Zusammenleben\". *Dom Radio*.\n12. **^** Markus Feldenkirchen (24 September 2009). \"From Pen-Pusher to Chancellor Candidate: Frank-Walter Steinmeier's Reluctant Path into the Spotlight\". *Der Spiegel*.\n13. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** Melissa Eddy (30 September 2013). \"German Politician Faces Plagiarism Accusations\". *The New York Times*.\n14. **^** \"Opposition Leader Steinmeier to Donate Kidney to His Wife\". *SPIEGEL ONLINE, Germany*. 23 August 2010.

He was a close aide of Gerhard Schr\u00f6der when Schr\u00f6der was Prime Minister of Lower Saxony during most of the 1990s, and served as Schr\u00f6der's chief of staff from 1996. When Schr\u00f6der became Chancellor of Germany in 1998, Steinmeier was appointed Under-Secretary of State in the German Chancellery with the responsibility for the intelligence services. From 1999 to 2005 he served as Chief of Staff of the Chancellery.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA major controversy during Steinmeier's term as chief of staff was the imprisonment of a German-born Turk, Murat Kurnaz, in Guant\u00e1namo Bay from 2002 until August 2006. Steinmeier denied during a parliamentary inquiry in March 2007 that he had blocked Kurnaz's release. Instead, he claimed that Berlin had feared Kurnaz was a threat and should go to Turkey, not Germany, if released. Only after Merkel's election was Kurnaz released and brought back to Germany.[23]\n\n\n\n![](image)Frank-Walter Steinmeier (2009)\n### First term as Foreign Minister, 2005\u20132009[edit]\n\n\nOn 22 November 2005, after the 2005 federal elections, Steinmeier became Minister of Foreign Affairs in the Grand coalition cabinet led by Angela Merkel.[18] He was the first SPD Foreign Minister since Willy Brandt (1966\u20131969).\n\n\nUpon taking office, Steinmeier led the preparations for Germany taking over the rotating presidency of the Council of the European Union in the first half of 2007.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFollowing the 2005 federal election, Steinmeier became Foreign Minister in the first grand coalition government of Angela Merkel, and from 2007 he additionally held the office of vice chancellor. In 2008, he briefly served as acting chairman of his party. He was the SPD's candidate for chancellor in the 2009 federal election, but his party lost the election and he left the federal cabinet to become leader of the opposition. Following the 2013 federal election, he again became Minister for Foreign Affairs in Merkel's second grand coalition. In November 2016 he was announced as the candidate for President of Germany of the governing coalition, consisting of his own party and the CDU/CSU, and thus became the presumptive electee, as the coalition held a large majority in the Federal Convention.

His father was the eldest son of Charlotte, Grand Duchess of Luxembourg, and Prince F\u00e9lix of Bourbon-Parma. His mother was the only daughter of King Leopold III of Belgium by his first wife, Princess Astrid of Sweden. The prince's godparents were his maternal uncle the Prince of Li\u00e8ge (later Albert II of Belgium) and his paternal aunt Princess Marie Gabriele.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nHenri has four siblings: Archduchess Marie Astrid of Austria (born 1954), Prince Jean of Luxembourg (born 1957), Princess Margaretha of Liechtenstein (born 1957) and Prince Guillaume of Luxembourg (born 1963).[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Prince Arnaud\n* Prince Christophe\n\n\n\n\n---\n |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\n**Henri** (French: *Henri Albert Gabriel F\u00e9lix Marie Guillaume*,[2] pronounced [\u0251\u0303\u0280i]; German: *Heinrich*; born 16 April 1955) is Grand Duke of Luxembourg. He has reigned since 7 October 2000. Henri is the eldest son of Grand Duke Jean and Princess Jos\u00e9phine-Charlotte of Belgium. He is a first cousin of King Philippe of Belgium. In 2019, Henri's net worth was estimated around US$4 billion.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## Childhood[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGrand Duke Henri is commander-in-chief of the Luxembourg Army, in which he holds the rank of general. In addition, he was made an honorary major in the British Army's Parachute Regiment, effective 19 July 1989.[9]\n\n\nOne of the grand duke's main functions is to represent Luxembourg in the field of foreign affairs. In May 2001, Grand Duke Henri and Grand Duchess Maria Teresa undertook their first foreign state visit to Spain at the invitation of King Juan Carlos and Queen Sof\u00eda of Spain.\n\n\nGrand Duke Henri is a member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), a member of The Mentor Foundation (established by the World Health Organization) and a director of the Charles Darwin Trust for the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands.[10]\n\n\nThe grand duke lives with his family at Berg Castle in Luxembourg.

This was similar to the \"escape route\" provided to his uncle King Baudouin of Belgium when he refused to sign an abortion law in 1991; thus the law could take effect without the signature of the grand duke, but also without the need to enact far-reaching changes in the constitution.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* ![](image) Co-Grand Master and Knight of the Order of the Gold Lion of the House of Nassau\n* ![](image) Grand Master and Grand Cross of the Order of Civil and Military Merit of Adolph of Nassau\n* ![](image) Grand Master and Grand Cross of the Order of the Oak Crown\n* ![](image) Grand Master of the Order of Merit of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg\n* Grand Collar of the European Foundation of Merit\n\n\n### Foreign[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This biography of a living person **needs additional citations for verification**.

He is the first child of Princess Beatrix and Prince Claus,[5] and the first grandchild of Queen Juliana and Prince Bernhard. He was the first male Dutch royal baby since the birth of Prince Alexander in 1851, and the first immediate male heir since Alexander's death in 1884.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 10 October 2010, Willem-Alexander and M\u00e1xima went to the Netherlands Antilles' capital, Willemstad, to attend and represent his mother, the Queen, at the Antillean Dissolution ceremony.\n\n\nHe was a patron of the Dutch Olympic Games Committee until 1998 when he was made a member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC). After becoming King, he relinquished his membership and received the Gold Olympic Order at the 125th IOC Session.[17] To celebrate the 100th anniversary of the 1928 Summer Olympics held in Amsterdam, he had expressed support to bid for the 2028 Summer Olympics.[18]\n\n\nHe was a member of the supervisory board of De Nederlandsche Bank (the Dutch central bank), a member of the Advisory Council of ECP (the information society forum for government, business and civil society), patron of Veterans' Day and held several other patronages and posts.[19]\n\n\n\n## Reign[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Inauguration of Willem-Alexander\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAt his accession at age 46, he was Europe's youngest monarch. On the inauguration of Spain's Felipe VI on 19 June 2014, he became, and remains, Europe's second-youngest monarch. He is also the first male monarch of the Netherlands since the death of his great-great-grandfather William III in 1890. Willem-Alexander was one of four new monarchs to take the throne in 2013 along with Pope Francis, the Emir Tamim bin Hamad of Qatar, and King Philippe of Belgium.\n\n\n\n## Other activities[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n6. **^** \"Doop Willem-Alexander\" [Baptism of Willem-Alexander]. *Nederlandse Omroep Stichting* (in Dutch).

The government declared that the head of state cannot be a serving member of the armed forces, since the government itself holds supreme command over the armed forces. As king, Willem-Alexander may choose to wear a military uniform with royal insignia, but not with his former rank insignia.[14]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHe had two younger brothers: Prince Friso (1968\u20132013) and Prince Constantijn (born in 1969). He lived with his family at the castle Drakensteyn in the hamlet Lage Vuursche near Baarn from his birth until 1981, when they moved to the larger palace Huis ten Bosch in The Hague. His mother, Beatrix, became Queen of the Netherlands in 1980, after his grandmother Juliana abdicated. He then received the title of Prince of Orange as heir apparent to the throne of the Kingdom of the Netherlands at the age of 13.[5]\n\n\nWillem-Alexander attended local state primary school Nieuwe Baarnse Elementary School in Baarn from 1973 to 1979. He went to two different state secondary schools: the Baarns Lyceum in Baarn from 1979 to 1981 and the Eerste Vrijzinnig Christelijk Lyceum in The Hague from 1981 to 1983, and the private sixth-form college United World College of the Atlantic in Wales, the UK (1983 to 1985), from which he received his International Baccalaureate.[5][9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n16. **^** \"About UNSGAB\". *United Nations Secretary-Generals' Advisory Board on Water and Sanitation*.
