The first to take the title was Odoacer, a barbarian military leader, in the late 5th century, followed by the Ostrogothic kings up to the mid-6th century. With the Frankish conquest of Italy in the 8th century, the Carolingians assumed the title, which was maintained by subsequent Holy Roman Emperors throughout the Middle Ages. The last Emperor to claim the title was Charles V in the 16th century. During this period, the holders of the title were crowned with the Iron Crown of Lombardy.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| No.\n | Portrait\n | Name\n | Term\n | Tenure\n | Election YearVoter Percentage\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **—** | ![](image) | **Alcide De Gasperi**(1881–1954) | **—** | 12 June1946\n | 1 July1946\n | —\n |\n| He exercised the powers of Provisional Head of State as Prime Minister between the departure of King Umberto II on 12 June 1946, and the proclamation of Enrico De Nicola as Head of State by the Constituent Assembly |\n| **1** | ![](image) | **Enrico De Nicola**(1877–1959) | **1** | 1 July1946\n | 25 June1947\n | 1946 — 78.57%396\n |\n| **2** | 26 June1947\n | 1 January1948\n | 1947 — 93.96%405\n |\n|  |\n\n\n## Presidents[edit]\n\n\nUnder the Constitution, the first constitution of the Republic of Italy, the President replaced the monarch as ceremonial head of state.

As a reservist for the Royal Marechaussee, he was made brigadier general in 2005.[9]\n\n\nBefore his investiture as king in 2013, Willem-Alexander was honourably discharged from the armed forces. The government declared that the head of state cannot be a serving member of the armed forces, since the government itself holds supreme command over the armed forces. As king, Willem-Alexander may choose to wear a military uniform with royal insignia, but not with his former rank insignia.[14]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHe had two younger brothers: Prince Friso (1968–2013) and Prince Constantijn (born in 1969). He lived with his family at the castle Drakensteyn in the hamlet Lage Vuursche near Baarn from his birth until 1981, when they moved to the larger palace Huis ten Bosch in The Hague. His mother, Beatrix, became Queen of the Netherlands in 1980, after his grandmother Juliana abdicated. He then received the title of Prince of Orange as heir apparent to the throne of the Kingdom of the Netherlands at the age of 13.[5]\n\n\nWillem-Alexander attended local state primary school Nieuwe Baarnse Elementary School in Baarn from 1973 to 1979. He went to two different state secondary schools: the Baarns Lyceum in Baarn from 1979 to 1981 and the Eerste Vrijzinnig Christelijk Lyceum in The Hague from 1981 to 1983, and the private sixth-form college United World College of the Atlantic in Wales, the UK (1983 to 1985), from which he received his International Baccalaureate.[5][9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n16. **^** \"About UNSGAB\". *United Nations Secretary-Generals' Advisory Board on Water and Sanitation*.

The latest royal decree therefore reverses previous changes made to the Royal versions of the coat arms which removed the armorial bearings of Saxony during the First World War.[22] By including the three official languages in the motto it reflects his wish \"to be the King of the whole Kingdom and of all Belgians\".[23]\nAdopted\n12 July 2019\nCoronet\nRoyal crown of Belgium\nHelm\nA golden royal helm with the visor open\nEscutcheon\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |\n|  |\n|  | 15.

This was similar to the \"escape route\" provided to his uncle King Baudouin of Belgium when he refused to sign an abortion law in 1991; thus the law could take effect without the signature of the grand duke, but also without the need to enact far-reaching changes in the constitution.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* ![](image) Co-Grand Master and Knight of the Order of the Gold Lion of the House of Nassau\n* ![](image) Grand Master and Grand Cross of the Order of Civil and Military Merit of Adolph of Nassau\n* ![](image) Grand Master and Grand Cross of the Order of the Oak Crown\n* ![](image) Grand Master of the Order of Merit of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg\n* Grand Collar of the European Foundation of Merit\n\n\n### Foreign[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This biography of a living person **needs additional citations for verification**.

His mother, born in Breslau (now Wrocław, Poland), came as a refugee from a Lutheran part of Silesia during the flight and expulsion of Germans after World War II.[11]\n\n\nFollowing his *Abitur*, Steinmeier did his military service from 1974 to 1976, then studied law and political science at the Justus Liebig University Giessen, where Brigitte Zypries was a fellow student.[12] In 1982 he passed his first and in 1986 his second state examination in law. Steinmeier worked as a scientific assistant to the professor of public law and political science at Giessen University until he obtained his doctorate of law in 1991. His dissertation explored the state's role in preventing homelessness.[13]\n\n\n\n### Family life[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPresident Joachim Gauck announced in June 2016 that he would not run for re-election, resulting in a search for a candidate to succeed him.[136] In November 2016, Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives agreed with the Social Democrats to support Steinmeier's candidacy for president in the presidential election, scheduled for 12 February 2017.[137]\n\n\nMerkel had originally wanted to nominate Green politician Marianne Birthler, and as the CDU/CSU and the Greens control a majority in the Federal Convention, Birthler's election would have been secured. However, Birthler after some time decided not to run.[138]\n\n\nOn 12 February 2017 Germany's 16th Federal Convention elected Steinmeier President on the first ballot, with 931 votes out of a total of 1,260.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSteinmeier is married and has one daughter. On 24 August 2010, he donated a kidney to his wife, Elke Büdenbender.[14]\n\n\nIn 2015, Steinmeier served as best man at the wedding of Rüdiger Grube and Cornelia Poletto in Hamburg.[15]\n\n\n\n### Interests[edit]\n\n\nSteinmeier enjoys jazz, and is an avid football fan.[16]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nSteinmeier is a Reformed Protestant and an active member of the Reformed Bethlehem congregation in Berlin-Neukölln.[17] He was baptized into his father's church (the Church of Lippe) as a youth.\n\n\n\n### Early career[edit]\n\n\nSteinmeier became an adviser in 1991 for Law of Communication media and media guidelines in the State Chancellery of Lower Saxony in Hanover. In 1993, he became director of the Personal Office for the prime minister of Lower Saxony, Gerhard Schröder. In 1996, he became the Secretary of State and head of the State Chancellery of Lower Saxony.\n\n\n\n## Political career on federal level[edit]\n\n\n### Schröder Federal Chancellery, 1998–2005[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the following weeks, Steinmeier played an important role in the formation of the next government. This is because if the Bundestag fails to elect a chancellor in 14 days of voting,[141] the president can either appoint the individual with most votes to lead a minority government or dissolve the Bundestag and call new elections. This type of political crisis had never been seen in Germany before and pushed the president into a quite powerful position which is rare for Germany. Steinmeier declared he would not consider a dissolution of the Bundestag as a preferable solution, and managed to persuade Schulz to meet with Angela Merkel and start preliminary talks. After long coalition talks, CDU, CSU and SPD formed a new grand coalition. Merkel was re-elected in the Bundestag on 14 March 2018.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### 2022 re-election[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Steinmeier with Finnish prime minister Sanna Marin in Helsinki, April 2022\nOn 13 February 2022 he was re-elected as president.[142]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n9. **^** Judy Dempsey (17 October 2005), \"A promotion to cabinet for Schröder's top aide\". *The New York Times*.\n10. **^** Alex Grimm (10 February 2009). \"To be perfectly Frank... minister shortens name\". *Reuters*.\n11. **^** \"Das Ehepaar Steinmeier über das ökumenische Zusammenleben\". *Dom Radio*.\n12. **^** Markus Feldenkirchen (24 September 2009). \"From Pen-Pusher to Chancellor Candidate: Frank-Walter Steinmeier's Reluctant Path into the Spotlight\". *Der Spiegel*.\n13. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** Melissa Eddy (30 September 2013). \"German Politician Faces Plagiarism Accusations\". *The New York Times*.\n14. **^** \"Opposition Leader Steinmeier to Donate Kidney to His Wife\". *SPIEGEL ONLINE, Germany*. 23 August 2010.

He was a close aide of Gerhard Schröder when Schröder was Prime Minister of Lower Saxony during most of the 1990s, and served as Schröder's chief of staff from 1996. When Schröder became Chancellor of Germany in 1998, Steinmeier was appointed Under-Secretary of State in the German Chancellery with the responsibility for the intelligence services. From 1999 to 2005 he served as Chief of Staff of the Chancellery.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA major controversy during Steinmeier's term as chief of staff was the imprisonment of a German-born Turk, Murat Kurnaz, in Guantánamo Bay from 2002 until August 2006. Steinmeier denied during a parliamentary inquiry in March 2007 that he had blocked Kurnaz's release. Instead, he claimed that Berlin had feared Kurnaz was a threat and should go to Turkey, not Germany, if released. Only after Merkel's election was Kurnaz released and brought back to Germany.[23]\n\n\n\n![](image)Frank-Walter Steinmeier (2009)\n### First term as Foreign Minister, 2005–2009[edit]\n\n\nOn 22 November 2005, after the 2005 federal elections, Steinmeier became Minister of Foreign Affairs in the Grand coalition cabinet led by Angela Merkel.[18] He was the first SPD Foreign Minister since Willy Brandt (1966–1969).\n\n\nUpon taking office, Steinmeier led the preparations for Germany taking over the rotating presidency of the Council of the European Union in the first half of 2007.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFollowing the 2005 federal election, Steinmeier became Foreign Minister in the first grand coalition government of Angela Merkel, and from 2007 he additionally held the office of vice chancellor. In 2008, he briefly served as acting chairman of his party. He was the SPD's candidate for chancellor in the 2009 federal election, but his party lost the election and he left the federal cabinet to become leader of the opposition. Following the 2013 federal election, he again became Minister for Foreign Affairs in Merkel's second grand coalition. In November 2016 he was announced as the candidate for President of Germany of the governing coalition, consisting of his own party and the CDU/CSU, and thus became the presumptive electee, as the coalition held a large majority in the Federal Convention.
