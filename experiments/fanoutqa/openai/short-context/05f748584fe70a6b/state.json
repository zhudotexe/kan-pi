Zuckerberg faced expulsion and was charged by the administration with breach of security, violating copyrights, and violating individuals' privacy. Ultimately, the charges were dropped.[9] Zuckerberg expanded on this initial project that semester by creating a social study tool ahead of an art history final exam. He uploaded art images to a website, each of which was featured with a corresponding comments section, then shared the site with his classmates, and people started sharing notes.[13]\n\n\nOn October 25, 2010, entrepreneur and banker Rahul Jain auctioned off the FaceMash.com domain to an unknown buyer for $30,201.[14][15]\n\n\n\n## TheFacebook[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n128. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** Thomas, Owen (July 20, 2007). \"A brief history of Mark Zuckerberg's legal woes\".

It replaces the tabs at the top of each profile page with links on the left side of the page.[159] |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nJust six days after the launch of the site, three Harvard University seniors, Cameron Winklevoss, Tyler Winklevoss, and Divya Narendra, accused Zuckerberg of intentionally misleading them into believing that he would help them build a social network called HarvardConnection.com, but instead using their idea to build a competing product.[20] The three complained to the *Crimson*, and the newspaper began an investigation. Zuckerberg knew about the investigation so he used TheFacebook.com to find members in the site who identified themselves as members of the *Crimson*. He examined a history of failed logins to see if any of the *Crimson* members had ever entered an incorrect password into TheFacebook.com. In the cases in which they had failed to log in, Zuckerberg tried to use them to access the *Crimson* members' Harvard email accounts, and he was successful in accessing two of them. In the end, three *Crimson* members filed a lawsuit against Zuckerberg which was later settled.[20][21]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFacebook was initially incorporated as a Florida LLC. For the first few months after its launch in February 2004, the costs for the website operations for thefacebook.com were paid for by Mark Zuckerberg and Eduardo Saverin, who had taken equity stakes in the company. The website also ran a few advertisements to meet its operating costs.[61]\n\n\n\n### First angel investment[edit]\n\n\nIn the summer of 2004, venture capitalist Peter Thiel made a $500,001 angel investment in the social network Facebook for 10.2% of the company and joined Facebook's board.

The concept was an online dating service that ultimately failed but had an exceptional video and uploading platform.[11] After the infamous Justin Timberlake and Janet Jackson Halftime show incident, the three creators realized they couldn't find any videos of it on the internet, after noticing that this type of platform did not exist they made the changes to become the first major video sharing platform.[12] The idea of the new company was for non-computer experts to be able to use a simple interface that allowed the user to publish, upload and view streaming videos through standard web browsers and modern internet speeds. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn March 30 and 31, 2012, in the course of earth hour, the site used a light-on-dark color scheme (or \"dark theme\"). A switch was located left to the video title, allowing to toggle back if desired. This is the earliest known use of a light-on-dark color scheme on the site. The switch was removed the following day and the bright background was restored.[120][121]\n\n\nFrom 2010 to 2012, Alexa ranked YouTube as the third most visited website on the Internet after Google and Facebook.[122]\n\n\nIn late 2011 and early 2012, YouTube launched over 100 \"premium\" or \"original\" channels. It was reported the initiative cost $100 million.[123] Two years later, in November 2013, it was documented that the landing page of the original channels became a 404 error page.[124][125] Despite this, original channels such as SourceFed and Crash Course were able to become successful.[126][127]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n38. **^** \"GooTube: Google buys YouTube\".

A month earlier, after Koum purchased an iPhone, he and Acton decided to create an app for the App Store. The idea started off as an app that would display statuses in a phone's Contacts menu, showing if a person was at work or on a call.[62]\n\n\nTheir discussions often took place at the home of Koum's Russian friend Alex Fishman in West San Jose. They realized that to take the idea further, they would need an iPhone developer. Fishman visited RentACoder.com, found Russian developer Igor Solomennikov, and introduced him to Koum.[62]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Horwitz, Jeff (February 12, 2020). \"As WhatsApp Tops 2 Billion Users, Its Boss Vows to Defend Encryption\". *Wall Street Journal*.

He officially joined WhatsApp on November 1.[27] Koum then hired a friend in Los Angeles, Chris Peiffer, to develop a BlackBerry version, which arrived two months later.[27] Subsequently, WhatsApp for Symbian OS was added in May 2010, and for Android OS in August 2010.[64] In 2010 Google made multiple acquisition offers for WhatsApp, which were all declined.[65]\n\n\nTo cover the cost of sending verification texts to users, WhatsApp was changed from a free service to a paid one. In December 2009, the ability to send photos was added to the iOS version. By early 2011, WhatsApp was one of the top 20 apps in the U.S. Apple App Store.[27]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn April 2018, WhatsApp co-founder and CEO Jan Koum announced he would be leaving the company.[109] By leaving before November 2018, due to concerns about privacy, advertising, and monetization by Facebook,[110] Acton and Koum gave up $1.3 billion in unvested stock options.[111] Facebook later announced that Koum's replacement would be Chris Daniels.[112]\n\n\nOn November 25, 2019, WhatsApp announced an investment of $250,000 through a partnership with Startup India to provide 500 startups with Facebook ad credits of $500 each.[113]\n\n\nIn December 2019, WhatsApp announced that a new update would lock out any Apple users who hadn't updated to iOS 9 or higher and Samsung, Huawei, Sony and Google users who hadn't updated to version 4.0 by February 1, 2020. The company also reported that Windows Phone operating systems would no longer be supported after December 31, 2019.[114] WhatsApp was announced to be the 3rd most downloaded mobile phone app of the decade 2010\u20132019.[115]\n\n\n\n### Since 2020[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nKoum named the app WhatsApp to sound like \"what's up\". On February 24, 2009, he incorporated[63] WhatsApp Inc. in California. However, when early versions of WhatsApp kept crashing, Koum considered giving up and looking for a new job. Acton encouraged him to wait for a \"few more months\".[62]\n\n\nIn June 2009, when the app had been downloaded by only a handful of Fishman's Russian-speaking friends, Apple launched push notifications, allowing users to be pinged even when not using the app.\n\n\nKoum updated WhatsApp so that everyone in the user's network would be notified when a user's status changed. This new facility, to Koum's surprise, was used by users to ping \"each other with jokey custom statuses like, 'I woke up late' or 'I'm on my way.'\"[62]\n\n\nFishman said \"At some point it sort of became instant messaging\".[62]\n\n\nWhatsApp 2.0, released for iPhone in August 2009, featured a purpose-designed messaging component; the number of active users suddenly increased to 250,000.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMessaging and VoIP service owned by Meta Platforms\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhatsApp| ![](image) |\n| Original author(s) | Brian Acton, Jan Koum |\n| Developer(s) | Meta Platforms, Will Cathcart (Head of WhatsApp)[1][2] |\n| Initial release | February\u00a02009; 15\u00a0years ago\u00a0(2009-02) |\n|  |\n| Stable release(s) [\u00b1] |\n| \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| iOS | 24.6.77[3]\u00a0![Edit this on Wikidata](image) / March 25, 2024; 2 months ago\u00a0(March 25, 2024) |\n| Android | 2.24.6.78[4]\u00a0![Edit this on Wikidata](image) / March 25, 2024; 2 months ago\u00a0(March 25, 2024) |\n| Windows | 2.2411.4.0[5]\u00a0![Edit this on Wikidata](image) / March 25, 2024; 2 months ago\u00a0(March 25, 2024) |\n| macOS | 2.24.5.76[6]\u00a0![Edit this on Wikidata](image) / March 14, 2024; 2 months ago\u00a0(March 14, 2024) |\n\n |\n| Preview release(s) [\u00b1] |\n| \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Android (Beta) | 2.24.7.25[7]\u00a0![Edit this on Wikidata](image) / March 29, 2024; 2 months ago\u00a0(March 29, 2024) |\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n8. **^** O'Connell, Ainsley (February 21, 2014). \"Inside Erlang, The Rare Programming Language Behind WhatsApp's Success\". *fastcompany.com*.

In April 2012, Facebook Inc. acquired the service for approximately US$1\u00a0billion in cash and stock. The Android version was released in April 2012, followed by a feature-limited desktop interface in November 2012, a Fire OS app in June 2014, and an app for Windows 10 in October 2016. As of October\u00a02015[update], over 40\u00a0billion photos had been uploaded. Although often admired for its success and influence, Instagram has also been criticized for negatively affecting teens' mental health, its policy and interface changes, its alleged censorship, and illegal and inappropriate content uploaded by users.\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Instagram.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Instagram icon from 2016 to 2022, when it was updated to include even more saturated colors\nInstagram began development in San Francisco as **Burbn**, a mobile check-in app created by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger.

The plaintiff of the lawsuit, college student Misty Hong, downloaded the app but said she never created an account. She realized a few months later that TikTok had created an account for her using her information (such as biometrics) and made a summary of her information. The lawsuit also alleged that information was sent to Chinese tech giant Baidu.[392] In July 2020, twenty lawsuits against TikTok were merged into a single class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.[393] In February 2021, TikTok agreed to pay $92 million to settle the class action lawsuit.[394]\n\n\n\n### Voice actor lawsuit[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n46. **^** Zeitchik, Steven (18 May 2020). \"In surprise move, a top Disney executive will run TikTok\". *The Washington Post*.
