ISBN\u00a0978-0-8160-5953-9. Saudi Arabia is not totalitarian. Travel outside the country is common, political crimes and violence are rare, people are not in constant fear of the police, and the state does not try to take over all existing organizations, such as philanthropic, religious, commercial, and industrial groups. Saudi rulers still see themselves in a parental role, much like a sheikh of a tribe who is in close touch with the concerns of his tribesmen and keeps those concerns in balance. For so long a time, a relatively benign monarchy has ruled over this populace that it has become used to being looked after in this manner. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Saudi Arabia.

The royal family dominates the political system. The family's vast numbers allows it to control most of the kingdom's important posts and to have an involvement and presence at all levels of government.[153] The number of princes is estimated to be at least 7000, with most power and influence being wielded by the 200 or so male descendants of Ibn Saud.[154] The key ministries are generally reserved for the royal family,[133] as are the 13 regional governorships.[155]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n18. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Lindsay, James E.

It covers the bulk of the Arabian Peninsula and has a land area of about 2150000\u00a0km2 (830000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), making it the fifth-largest country in Asia and the largest in the Middle East. It is bordered by the Red Sea to the west; Jordan, Iraq, and Kuwait to the north; the Persian Gulf, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates to the east; Oman to the southeast; and Yemen to the south. Bahrain is an island country off its east coast. The Gulf of Aqaba in the northwest separates Saudi Arabia from Egypt and Israel. Saudi Arabia is the only country with a coastline along both the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf, and most of its terrain consists of arid desert, lowland, steppe, and mountains. Saudi Arabia's capital and largest city is Riyadh; the kingdom is also the location of Islam's two holiest cities of Mecca and Medina.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSince 2011, Saudi Arabia has been affected by its own Arab Spring protests.[123] In response, King Abdullah announced on 22 February 2011 a series of benefits for citizens amounting to $36 billion, of which $10.7 billion was earmarked for housing.[124][125][126] No political reforms were included, though some prisoners indicted for financial crimes were pardoned.[127] Abdullah also announced a package of $93 billion, which included 500000 new homes to a cost of $67 billion, in addition to creating 60000 new security jobs.[128][129] Although male-only municipal elections were held on 29 September 2011,[130][131] Abdullah allowed women to vote and be elected in the 2015 municipal elections, and also to be nominated to the Shura Council.[132]\n\n\n\n## Politics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Politics of Saudi Arabia\n\n![](image)\nSalman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud   \nKing (r.\u20092015\u2013present)\n![](image)\nMohammed bin Salman  \nCrown Prince and Prime Minister\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1995, Fahd suffered a debilitating stroke, and the Crown Prince, Abdullah, assumed the role of *de facto* regent; however, his authority was hindered by conflict with Fahd's full brothers (known, with Fahd, as the \"Sudairi Seven\").[119]\n\n\n\n### 21st century[edit]\n\n\nSigns of discontent included, in 2003 and 2004, a series of bombings and armed violence in Riyadh, Jeddah, Yanbu and Khobar.[120] In February\u2013April 2005, the first-ever nationwide municipal elections were held in Saudi Arabia.

Supreme Council of Rulers appoints the five judges headed by a president to the Supreme Court. The judges are responsible for deciding if federal laws are constitutional, mediating between inter-emirate disputes.[16] It also possesses the authority to try cases involving cabinet and senior federal officials. Although secular law is applied, the basis of legislation is Sharia (Islamic Law) and involves three of the four schools including (mainly) Maliki, but also the Hanbali and Shafi'i schools.[11]\n\n\n\n## Criticism[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n![United Arab Emirates](image) Elections in the United Arab Emirates\n |\n| --- |\n| Parliamentary elections | * 2006\n* 2011\n* 2015\n* 2019\n* 2023\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)The seven Emirates of the United Arab Emirates: 1. Abu Dhabi 2. Ajman 3. Sharjah 4. Dubai 5. Fujairah 6. Ras Al-Khaimah 7. Umm Al-Quwain\nThe relative prestige and financial influence of each emirate is reflected in the allocation of positions in the federal government. The ruler of Abu Dhabi, whose emirate is the UAE's major oil producer, is president of the UAE. The ruler of Dubai, which is the UAE's commercial center and a former oil producer, is vice president and prime minister.\n\n\nSince achieving independence in 1971, the UAE has worked to strengthen its federal institutions. Nonetheless, each emirate still retains substantial autonomy, and progress toward greater federal integration has slowed in recent years. A basic concept in the UAE government's development as a federal system is that a significant percentage of each emirate's revenues should be devoted to the UAE central budget.[16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe constitution of the United Arab Emirates established the positions of president (chief of state) and vice president and elected by the rulers of each of the emirates from within (the seven rulers comprise the Federal Supreme Council, which also has an elected chairman and a vice chairman each serving five-year terms); a Council of Ministers (cabinet), led by a prime minister (head of government); a supreme council of rulers; and a 40-member National Assembly (known as the Federal National Council), a consultative body whose members are partially appointed by the emirate rulers and partially elected; and an independent judiciary which includes the Federal Supreme Court. Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan was president of the UAE from its foundation until his death on November 2, 2004. His oldest son, Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, was president until his death May 13, 2022. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAdministratively, the UAE is a federation of seven emirates, each with its own ruler. The pace of local government reform in each emirate is set primarily by the ruler. Under the provisional constitution of 1971, each emirate reserves considerable powers, including control over mineral rights (notably oil) and revenues. In this milieu, federal powers have developed slowly as each Emirate already had its own existing institutions of government prior to the country's official foundation. The Constitution of the United Arab Emirates separates powers into executive, legislative, and judicial branches. Additionally, legislative and executive powers are divided into federal and emirate jurisdictions.[11]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe 2023 international investigation series Abu Dhabi Secrets revealed United Arab Emirates\u2019 influence strategy to spy on citizens of 18 countries in Europe and beyond. Using a Swiss intelligence firm Alp Services the UAE intelligence services received the names of more than 1000 individuals and 400 organizations in 18 European countries, labelling them as part of the Muslim Brotherhood network in Europe. \n\n\nThe Economist Intelligence Unit rated the United Arab Emirates an \"authoritarian regime\" in 2022.[24]\n\n\n\n## International organization affiliations[edit]\n\n\n* ABEDA\n* AfDB\n* AFESD\n* AL\n* AMF\n* CAEU\n* ESCWA\n* FAO\n* G-77\n* GCC\n* IAEA\n* IBRD\n* ICAO\n* ICRM\n* IDA\n* IDB\n* IFAD\n* IFC\n* IFRCS\n* IHO\n* ILO\n* IMF\n* IMO\n* Inmarsat\n* Intelsat\n* Interpol\n* IOC\n* ISO (correspondent)\n* ITU\n* NAM\n* OAPEC\n* OIC\n* OPCW\n* OPEC\n* United Nations\n* UNCTAD\n* UNESCO\n* UNIDO\n* UPU\n* WCO\n* WHO\n* WIPO\n* WMO\n* WTO\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Fatwa Council (United Arab Emirates)\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n10. **^** Krane, Jim (2019). *Energy Kingdoms: Oil and Political Survival in the Persian Gulf*.

The majority is happy with this unspoken bargain, which holds sway in most of the Gulf. The sheikhs get public backing in return for improvements in living standards, including jobs, homes, health care, and education. Tribal autocracy is one of the oldest ways of organizing society and the only form of governance the UAE has ever known.[8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Executive | * Cabinet\n* Federal Supreme Council\n* President\n* Prime Minister\n |\n| Legislative | * Federal Supreme Council\n* Federal National Council\n* Elections\n\t+ 2006\n\t+ 2011\n\t+ 2015\n\t+ 2019\n\t+ 2023\n |\n| Judicial | * Supreme Court\n |\n| Law | * Constitution\n\t+ Nationality\n |\n| Intelligence | * Signals Intelligence Agency\n |\n| Uniformed | * Armed Forces\n\t+ Air Force\n\t+ Army\n\t+ Navy\n\t+ Presidential Guard\n |\n\n |\n| Local\n | * Courts\n\t+ Abu Dhabi\n\t+ Dubai\n* Common law courts\n\t+ Abu Dhabi\n\t+ Dubai\n* Emirate rulers\n\t+ royal families\n* Governments\n\t+ Abu Dhabi\n\t+ Dubai\n\t+ Sharjah\n\t+ Ajman\n |\n| * Foreign relations\n\t+ Abraham Accords\n\t+ US-UAE nuclear energy agreement\n* Human rights\n\t+ blasphemy\n\t+ capital punishment\n\t+ freedom of religion\n\t+ LGBT\n\t+ migrant workers\n* Visa policy\n* Justice system\n* Legal system\n* Anthem\n* Coat of arms\n* Flag\n |\n\n |\n\n |\n| Economy | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nArticle 47 of the UAE constitution defines the powers of the council's authority in formulation of general policy; legislation on all matters of state; ratification of federal laws and decrees, including those relating to budget and fiscal matters; ratification of international treaties and agreements; and appointment of the prime minister and Supreme Court judges.[14] Decisions are made by majority vote unless relating to substantive issues which require a two-thirds majority vote (five out of seven rulers), which must include Abu Dhabi and Dubai.[11] The Supreme Council also elects the Council of Ministers, while an appointed 40-member Federal National Council, drawn from all the emirates, reviews proposed laws.\n\n\n\n## Council of Ministers (Cabinet)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cabinet of the United Arab Emirates\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Cabinet of United Arab Emirates (also called the Council of Ministers, Arabic: \u0645\u062c\u0644\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0632\u0631\u0627\u0621) is a collegial body presided over by the prime minister. It consists of 22 members and is also headed by a prime minister (chosen by the president with consultation). The federal cabinet is the executive authority for the federation. Under the supreme control of the president and supreme council, it manages all internal and foreign affairs of the federation under its constitutional and federal laws. The cabinet consists of cabinet's chairman (prime minister of UAE) and two deputies and ministers. The general secretariat shall be handled by the secretary general of the cabinet.[15]\n\n\n\n## Local politics[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n## Federal Supreme Council[edit]\n\n\nThe Federal Supreme Council consists of the individual rulers of the seven emirates. The president and vice-president are elected by the Supreme Council every five years. Although unofficial, the presidency is *de facto* hereditary to the Al Nahyan clan of Abu Dhabi and the prime minister post *de facto* is hereditary to the Al Maktoum clan of Dubai.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn 14 May 2022, Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan was elected as the UAE's new president after the death of Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan.[12]\n\n\nUnder federal authority, responsibilities include foreign affairs, security and defense, nationality and immigration issues, education, public health, currency, postal, telephone and other communications services, air traffic control, licensing of aircraft, labour relations, banking, delimitation of territorial waters and extradition of criminals. Issues excluded from Articles 120 and 121 of the Constitution are to be under the jurisdiction of respective emirates and are reaffirmed by Article 116 which states that: \u2018the emirates shall exercise all powers not assigned to the federation by this Constitution\u2019. This is further reiterated by Article 122, which stated that \u2018the emirates shall have jurisdiction in all matters not assigned to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federation, in accordance with the provision of the preceding two articles\u2019.[13]\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Federal National Council (*al-Majlis al-Watani al-Ittihadi*) is the UAE's legislative body and consists of 40 members. The body only has advisory powers.[3] Twenty of the members are indirectly elected by the hand-picked 33% of Emirati citizens who have voting rights through an electoral college, while the other twenty are appointed by the rulers of each emirate.[17][18][19] According to Reuters, \"the process of selecting the people who can either elect or be elected is opaque.\"[17]\n\n\nPolitical parties are banned.\n\n\nThe FNC is the main consultative body in the UAE and has both a legislative and supervisory role accorded by the Constitution.\n\n\nSince the council's inception, the following have been selected as speakers:[20]\nThani Abdullah Humaid, Taryam Omran Taryam, Hilal bin Ahmed bin Lootah, Al Haj bin Abdullah Al Muhairbi, Mohammed Khalifa Habtour, Saeed Mohammad Al Gandi, Abdul Aziz Al Ghurair, Mohammad Al-Murr, and Amal Al Qubaisi since 2015.\n\n\n\n## Federal Judiciary[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSubsequently, in 2007\u20132008 Abu Dhabi announced implementation of its own policy to modernize public administration practices and government performance. Plans for reevaluation were laid out in areas including economy, energy, tourism, health, education, labour, civil services, culture and heritage, good control, urban planning, transport, environment, health and safety, municipal affairs, police and emergency services, electronic government, women and legislative reform. Abu Dhabi hopes advancements towards global standards in these areas will improve the quality of services for its residents as well as attract future investment towards further modernizing the Emirate.[16]\n\n\nAs of 2011, the country did not see the type of trouble other Arab countries saw during the Arab spring. There were minor protests, during which some people were arrested.[23]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

The Emir is the head of state, whose powers are listed in the constitution\n\n\n\n## Executive branch[edit]\n\n\nThe Constitution of Kuwait was promulgated in 1962. \n\n\n\n### Government[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cabinet of Kuwait\n\nThe prime minister is appointed by the unelected head of state (Emir of Kuwait). The prime minister chooses the cabinet of ministers (government). \n\n\n\n### Emir[edit]\n\n\nThe Emir's powers are defined by the 1961 constitution. These powers include appointing the prime minister, who in turn chooses the cabinet (government). Upon the death of the Emir, the crown prince succeeds.\n\n\nPower in Kuwait has traditionally been balanced between the Emir \u2014 particularly under Mubarak \u2014 and the merchant class. Mubarak effectively built the modern Kuwaiti state, establishing the tax system, trade levies, a customs administration, and the provision of social services.[1] Political institutions were built in Kuwait in large part due to exit vetoes exercised by merchants on Mubarak. The acquiescence of the merchants and the broader population to the rule of the Emir and the Sabah family was due to a division of monopoly rents: the Sabah family, through the state, to control the oil industry, and the merchants to dominate other industries.[1] The public at large was given social services from education to health care, funded by oil wealth. This arrangement has allowed the ruling family \"to maintain power without making substantial political concessions.\"[1]\n\n\n\n## Judicial branch[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Legal system of Kuwait\n\nThe judiciary in Kuwait is not independent of the government, the Emir appoints all the judges and many judges are foreign nationals from Egypt. In each administrative district of Kuwait, there is a Summary Court (also called Courts of First Instance which are composed of one or more divisions, like a Traffic Court or an Administrative Court); then there is Court of Appeals; Cassation Court, and lastly - a Constitutional Court which interprets the constitution and deals with disputes related to the constitutionality of laws. Kuwait has a civil law legal system.\n\n\n\n## Legislative branch[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: National Assembly of Kuwait and Elections in Kuwait\n\nThe National Assembly is theoretically the main legislative branch in Kuwait.[1] The National Assembly theoretically has the power to remove government ministers from their post. The National Assembly can have up to 50 MPs. Fifty deputies are theoretically elected by popular vote to serve four-year terms. Members of the cabinet also sit in the parliament as deputies.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Government of Kuwait\n* History of Kuwait\n* Political issues in Kuwait\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** Gandhi, Jennifer (2008), \"Institutions and Policies under Dictatorship\", *Political Institutions under Dictatorship*, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp.\u00a044\u201352, doi:10.1017/cbo9780511510090.005, ISBN\u00a0978-0-511-51009-0, retrieved 2020-11-16\n\n## External links[edit]\n\n\n* Current Ministerial Formation (Council of Ministers General Secretariat)\n* Official English names of Kuwaiti ministers and ministries (Kuwaiti Government)\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n![Kuwait](image) Elections in Kuwait\n |\n| --- |\n| Parliamentary elections | * 1938 (Jun)\n* 1938 (Dec)\n* 1958\n* 1961\\*\n* 1963\n* 1967\n* 1971\n* 1975\n* 1981\n* 1985\n* 1990\n* 1992\n* 1996\n* 1999\n* 2003\n* 2006\n* 2008\n* 2009\n* 2012 (Feb)\n* 2012 (Dec)\n* 2013\n* 2016\n* 2020\n* 2022\n* 2023\n* 2024\n |\n| Municipal elections | * 1932\n* ...\n* 1964\n* 1972\n* 1976\n* 1980\n* 1984\n* 1993\n* 1995\n* 1999\n* 2005\n* 2009\n* 2013\n* 2018\n* 2022\n |\n| \\* Constitutional Convention\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nKuwait\u00a0articles\n |\n| --- |\n| History | * Battle of Chains\n* Sheikhdom\n* Kuwait-Najd War\n* Gulf War\n* Timeline of Kuwait City\n | ![](image)\n |\n| Geography | \n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * Borders\n* Geology\n* Islands\n* Rivers\n* Wildlife\n |\n\n |\n| Politics | \n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * Administrative divisions\n* Cabinet\n* Constitution\n* Crown Prince\n* Emir\n* Elections\n* Foreign relations\n* Government\n\t+ Prime Minister\n* Human rights\n\t+ LGBT rights\n\t+ Women's rights\n* Legislature\n* Military\n* Political parties\n* Visa policy\n |\n\n |\n| Economy | \n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * Banks in Kuwait\n* Central Bank\n* Dinar (currency)\n* Health\n* Stock Exchange\n* Telecommunications\n* Transport\n |\n\n |\n| Culture | \n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * Museums\n* Art\n* Music\n* Kuwait National Cultural District\n* Cinema\n* Kuwaiti television\n* Cuisine\n* Demographics\n* Education\n* Languages\n* Public holidays\n* Religion\n* Sport\n |\n\n |\n| * Outline\n* Index\n\n* Category\n* Portal\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nPolitics of Asia\n |\n| --- |\n| Sovereign states | * Afghanistan\n* Armenia\n* Azerbaijan\n* Bahrain\n* Bangladesh\n* Bhutan\n* Brunei\n* Cambodia\n* China\n* Cyprus\n* East Timor (Timor-Leste)\n* Egypt\n* Georgia\n* India\n* Indonesia\n* Iran\n* Iraq\n* Israel\n* Japan\n* Jordan\n* Kazakhstan\n* North Korea\n* South Korea\n* Kuwait\n* Kyrgyzstan\n* Laos\n* Lebanon\n* Malaysia\n* Maldives\n* Mongolia\n* Myanmar\n* Nepal\n* Oman\n* Pakistan\n* Philippines\n* Qatar\n* Russia\n* Saudi Arabia\n* Singapore\n* Sri Lanka\n* Syria\n* Tajikistan\n* Thailand\n* Turkey\n* Turkmenistan\n* United Arab Emirates\n* Uzbekistan\n* Vietnam\n* Yemen\n |\n| States withlimited recognition | * Abkhazia\n* Northern Cyprus\n* Palestine\n* South Ossetia\n* Taiwan\n |\n| Dependencies andother territories | * British Indian Ocean Territory\n* Christmas Island\n* Cocos (Keeling) Islands\n* Hong Kong\n* Macau\n |\n| * ![](image) Category\n* ![](image) Asia portal\n |\n\n</content>\n</document>",

A British-backed monarchy was established in 1921 under Faisal. The Hashemite Kingdom of Iraq gained independence from the UK in 1932. In 1958, the monarchy was overthrown and the Iraqi Republic created.[16] Iraq was ruled by the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party from 1968 until 2003, led by Ahmad Hassan al-Bakr and then by Saddam Hussein, as a one-party state. Iraq invaded Iran in 1980, sparking a protracted war that ended as a stalemate in 1988, with devastating losses for both sides. In 1990, Iraq invaded Kuwait, leading to global condemnation and a military campaign waged by US-led international coalition that expelled Iraqi forces from Kuwait. A 2003 invasion launched by another US-led coalition as part of its \"Global War on Terror\" resulted in the defeat of Ba'athist Iraq and execution of Saddam Hussein. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIraq is a federal parliamentary republic. The president is the head of state, the prime minister is the head of government, and the constitution provides for two deliberative bodies, the Council of Representatives and the Council of Union. The judiciary is free and independent of the executive and the legislature.[19] Iraq is considered an emerging middle power[20] with a strategic location[21] and a founding member of the United Nations, the OPEC as well as of the Arab League, OIC, Non-Aligned Movement and the IMF. From 1920 to 2005, Iraq experienced spells of significant economic and military growth and briefer instability including wars.\n\n\n\n\n## Name[edit]\n\n\n\nThere are several suggested origins for the name. One dates to the Sumerian city of Uruk and is thus ultimately of Sumerian origin.[22][23] Another possible etymology for the name is from the Middle Persian word *er\u0101q*, meaning \"lowlands.\"[24] An Arabic folk etymology for the name is \"deeply rooted, well-watered; fertile\".[25]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| \u2022\u00a0Republic declared\n | 14 July 1958 |\n| \u2022\u00a0Current constitution\n | 15 October 2005 |\n|  |\n| Area  |\n| \u2022\u00a0Total\n | 438,317\u00a0km2 (169,235\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) (58th) |\n| \u2022\u00a0Water\u00a0(%)\n | 4.62 (as of 2015)[4] |\n| Population |\n| \u2022\u00a02023 estimate\n | 43,500,000 (35th) |\n| \u2022\u00a0Density\n | 82.7/km2 (214.2/sq\u00a0mi) (125th) |\n| GDP\u00a0(PPP) | 2023\u00a0estimate |\n| \u2022\u00a0Total\n | ![Increase](image) $508.973 billion[5] (48th) |\n| \u2022\u00a0Per capita\n | ![Decrease](image) $11,742[5] (114th) |\n| GDP\u00a0(nominal) | 2023\u00a0estimate |\n| \u2022\u00a0Total\n | ![Decrease](image) $254.993 billion[5] (47th) |\n| \u2022\u00a0Per capita\n | ![Decrease](image) $5,882[5] (111th) |\n| Gini\u00a0(2012) | 29.5[6]low |\n| HDI\u00a0(2021) | ![Increase](image)\u00a00.686[7]medium\u00a0(121st) |\n| Currency | Iraqi dinar (IQD) |\n| Time zone | UTC+3 (AST) |\n| Driving side | right |\n| Calling code | +964 |\n| ISO 3166 code | IQ |\n| Internet TLD | .iq |\n| 1.

These three provinces were joined into one Kingdom by the British after the region became a League of Nations mandate, administered under British control, with the name \"State of Iraq\". A fourth province (Zor Sanjak), which Iraqi nationalists considered part of Upper Mesopotamia was ultimately added to Syria.[78][79] In line with their \"Sharifian Solution\" policy, the British established the Hashemite king on 23 August 1921, Faisal I of Iraq, who had been forced out of Syria by the French, as their client ruler. The official English name of the country simultaneously changed from *Mesopotamia* to the endonymic *Iraq*.[34] Likewise, British authorities selected Sunni Arab elites from the region for appointments to government and ministry offices.[*specify*][80][*page\u00a0needed*][81]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nCoat of arms\n |\n| **Anthem:**\u00a0\u0645\u0648\u0637\u0646\u064a*Maw\u1e6din\u012b*\"My Homeland\" |\n| ![Location of Iraq](image) |\n| Capitaland largest city\n | Baghdad33\u00b020\u2032N 44\u00b023\u2032E\ufeff / \ufeff33.333\u00b0N 44.383\u00b0E\ufeff / 33.333; 44.383 |\n| Official\u00a0languages | * Arabic\n* Kurdish[1]\n |\n| * Recognised regional languages\n | * Suret (Assyrian)\n* Turkish/Turkmen\n* Armenian[2]\n |\n| Ethnic\u00a0groups (1987)[2]\n | * 75\u201380% Arabs\n* 15\u201320% Kurds\n* 5% others (incl.

This revolt was strongly anti-imperial and anti-monarchical in nature and had strong socialist elements. King Faysal II, Prince Abd al-Ilah, and Nuri al-Sa'id were killed.[88] Qasim controlled Iraq through military rule and in 1958 he began a process of forcibly reducing surplus land owned by a few citizens and having the state redistribute the land. He was overthrown by Colonel Abdul Salam Arif in a February 1963 coup. After the latter's death in 1966, he was succeeded by his brother, Abdul Rahman Arif, who was overthrown by the Ba'ath Party in 1968.[89][90]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n5. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** \"World Economic Outlook Database, October 2023 Edition.

The occupation ended on 26 October 1947, although Britain was to retain military bases in Iraq until 1954, after which the Assyrian militias were disbanded. The rulers during the occupation and the remainder of the Hashemite monarchy were Nuri as-Said, the autocratic Prime Minister, who also ruled from 1930 to 1932, and 'Abd al-Ilah, the former Regent who now served as an adviser to King Faisal II.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Republic and Ba'athist Iraq[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Iraqi Republic (1958\u20131968), Ba'athist Iraq, and Iran\u2013Iraq War\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFaced with spiralling costs and influenced by the public protestations of the war hero T.

The Iraqi maqam is considered to be the most noble and perfect form of maqam. Al-maqam al-Iraqi is the collection of sung poems written either in one of the sixteen meters of classical Arabic or in Iraqi dialect (Zuhayri).[313] This form of art is recognised by UNESCO as \"an intangible heritage of humanity\".[314]\n\n\nEarly in the 20th century, many of the most prominent musicians in Iraq were Jewish.[315] In 1936, Iraq Radio was established with an ensemble made up entirely of Jews, with the exception of the percussion player.

Iranian government is authoritarian, and has attracted widespread criticism for its significant constraints and violations of human rights and civil liberties. It is also a focal point for Shia Islam within the Middle East. Since the Iranian Revolution, the country is considered to be the most determined adversary of Israel and Saudi Arabia. Iranian government has been criticized for various policies such as its alleged sponsorship of terrorism, funding of proxy militias and its involvement in the majority of modern Middle Eastern conflicts.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n**Iran**,[a] also known as **Persia**[b] and officially the **Islamic Republic of Iran** (**IRI**),[c] is a country in West Asia. It is bordered by Iraq to the west and Turkey to the northwest, Azerbaijan, Armenia, the Caspian Sea and Turkmenistan to the north, Afghanistan to the east, Pakistan to the southeast, the Gulf of Oman and the Persian Gulf to the south. It covers an area of 1.64\u00a0million square kilometers (0.63\u00a0million square miles), making it the world's 17th-largest country. With an estimated population of around 90 million as of 2023, Iran is the world's 17th-most populous country, and the second largest country in the Middle East. Its capital and largest city is Tehran with around 16 million people in its metropolitan area. Iran possesses the world\u2019s 17th strongest military. Its national animal is the Persian lion (de facto). \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nUnder the reign of Nader Shah in the 18th century, Iran presided over the most powerful military in the world, though by the 19th century, a series of conflicts with the Russian Empire led to significant territorial losses. The early 20th century saw the Persian Constitutional Revolution. Efforts to nationalize its fossil fuel supply led to an Anglo-American coup in 1953. After the Iranian Revolution, the current Islamic Republic was established in 1979 by Ruhollah Khomeini, who became the country's first supreme leader.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Predominantly Persian\n* 18% Azerbaijani and other Turkic languages (incl.
