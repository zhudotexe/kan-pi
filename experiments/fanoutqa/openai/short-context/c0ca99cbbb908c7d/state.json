Christie's stage play *The Mousetrap* holds the world record for the longest initial run. It opened at the Ambassadors Theatre in the West End on 25\u00a0November 1952, and by 2018 there had been more than 27,500 performances. The play was temporarily closed in 2020 because of COVID-19 lockdowns in London before it reopened in 2021.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn her prime, Christie was rarely out of the bestseller list.[164] She was the first crime writer to have 100,000 copies of 10 of her titles published by Penguin on the same day in 1948.[165][166] As of 2018[update], *Guinness World Records* listed Christie as the best-selling fiction writer of all time.[167] As of 2020[update], her novels had sold more than two billion copies in 44 languages.[167] Half the sales are of English-language editions, and half are translations.[168][169] According to Index Translationum, as of 2020[update], she was the most-translated individual author.[170][171]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2015, marking the 125th anniversary of her birth date, 25 contemporary mystery writers and one publisher gave their views on Christie's works. Many of the authors had read Christie's novels first, before other mystery writers, in English or in their native language, influencing their own writing, and nearly all still viewed her as the \"Queen of Crime\" and creator of the plot twists used by mystery authors. Nearly all had one or more favourites among Christie's mysteries and found her books still good to read nearly 100 years after her first novel was published.

G. Wells and Hugo Gernsback.[7] In the 2010s, he was the most translated French author in the world. In France, 2005 was declared \"Jules Verne Year\" on the occasion of the centenary of the writer's death.\n\n\n\n\n## Life[edit]\n\n\n### Early life[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nTranslation of Verne into English began in 1852, when Verne's short story *A Voyage in a Balloon* (1851) was published in the American journal *Sartain's Union Magazine of Literature and Art* in a translation by Anne T. Wilbur.[112] Translation of his novels began in 1869 with William Lackland's translation of *Five Weeks in a Balloon* (originally published in 1863),[113] and continued steadily throughout Verne's lifetime, with publishers and hired translators often working in great haste to rush his most lucrative titles into English-language print.[114] Unlike Hetzel, who targeted all ages with his publishing strategies for the *Voyages extraordinaires*, the British and American publishers of Verne chose to market his books almost exclusively to young audiences; this business move, with its implication that Verne could be treated purely as a children's author, had a long-lasting effect on Verne's reputation in English-speaking countries.[110][115]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Evans, Arthur B.

His extant works, including collaborations, consist of some 39 plays, 154 sonnets, three long narrative poems, and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright.[6] Shakespeare remains arguably the most influential writer in the English language, and his works continue to be studied and reinterpreted.\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

For instance, \"school tunic\" becomes \"uniform\", \"mother and father\" and \"mother and daddy\" (this latter one used by young female characters and deemed sexist) become \"mum and dad\",[161] \"bathing\" is replaced by \"swimming\", and \"jersey\" by \"jumper\".[157] Some commentators see the changes as necessary to encourage modern readers,[161] whereas others regard them as unnecessary and patronising.[157] In 2016 Hodder's parent company Hachette announced that they would abandon the revisions as, based on feedback, they had not been a success.[162]\n\n\n\n## Stage, film and television adaptations[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

G. Wells and Hugo Gernsback.[7] In the 2010s, he was the most translated French author in the world. In France, 2005 was declared \"Jules Verne Year\" on the occasion of the centenary of the writer's death.\n\n\n\n\n## Life[edit]\n\n\n### Early life[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nTranslation of Verne into English began in 1852, when Verne's short story *A Voyage in a Balloon* (1851) was published in the American journal *Sartain's Union Magazine of Literature and Art* in a translation by Anne T. Wilbur.[112] Translation of his novels began in 1869 with William Lackland's translation of *Five Weeks in a Balloon* (originally published in 1863),[113] and continued steadily throughout Verne's lifetime, with publishers and hired translators often working in great haste to rush his most lucrative titles into English-language print.[114] Unlike Hetzel, who targeted all ages with his publishing strategies for the *Voyages extraordinaires*, the British and American publishers of Verne chose to market his books almost exclusively to young audiences; this business move, with its implication that Verne could be treated purely as a children's author, had a long-lasting effect on Verne's reputation in English-speaking countries.[110][115]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Evans, Arthur B.

He is widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's pre-eminent dramatist.[3][4][5] He is often called England's national poet and the \"Bard of Avon\" (or simply \"the Bard\"). His extant works, including collaborations, consist of some 39 plays, 154 sonnets, three long narrative poems, and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright.[6] Shakespeare remains arguably the most influential writer in the English language, and his works continue to be studied and reinterpreted.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nShakespeare's influence extends far beyond his native England and the English language. His reception in Germany was particularly significant; as early as the 18th century Shakespeare was widely translated and popularised in Germany, and gradually became a \"classic of the German Weimar era;\" Christoph Martin Wieland was the first to produce complete translations of Shakespeare's plays in any language.[235][236] Actor and theatre director Simon Callow writes, \"this master, this titan, this genius, so profoundly British and so effortlessly universal, each different culture \u2013 German, Italian, Russian \u2013 was obliged to respond to the Shakespearean example; for the most part, they embraced it, and him, with joyous abandon, as the possibilities of language and character in action that he celebrated liberated writers across the continent. Some of the most deeply affecting productions of Shakespeare have been non-English, and non-European. He is that unique writer: he has something for everyone.\"[237]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Lifeand works | * Birthplace\n* Bibliography\n\t+ *Complete Works of William Shakespeare*\n\t+ Translations\n* Coat of arms\n* Collaborations\n* Editors\n* English Renaissance theatre\n* Globe Theatre\n* Handwriting\n* Lord Chamberlain's Men/King's Men\n\t+ The Theatre\n\t+ Curtain Theatre\n* Music\n* New Place\n* Portraits\n* Religious views\n* Sexuality\n* Spelling of his name\n* Stratford-upon-Avon\n* Style\n* Will\n* Grave\n |\n| Legacy | * Attribution studies\n* Authorship question\n* Bardolatry\n* Festivals\n* Gardens\n* Influence\n* Memorials\n* Screen adaptations\n* Shakespeare and *Star Trek*\n* Shakespeare's influence on Tolkien\n* Works titled after Shakespeare\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Institutions | * Folger Shakespeare Library\n\t+ *Shakespeare Quarterly*\n* Royal Shakespeare Company\n\t+ Royal Shakespeare Theatre\n* Shakespeare Birthplace Trust\n* Shakespeare's Globe (replica)\n* Shakespeare Institute\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

The changes, which Hodder described as \"subtle\", mainly affect the dialogue rather than the narrative. For instance, \"school tunic\" becomes \"uniform\", \"mother and father\" and \"mother and daddy\" (this latter one used by young female characters and deemed sexist) become \"mum and dad\",[161] \"bathing\" is replaced by \"swimming\", and \"jersey\" by \"jumper\".[157] Some commentators see the changes as necessary to encourage modern readers,[161] whereas others regard them as unnecessary and patronising.[157] In 2016 Hodder's parent company Hachette announced that they would abandon the revisions as, based on feedback, they had not been a success.[162]\n\n\n\n## Stage, film and television adaptations[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
