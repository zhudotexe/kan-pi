H. White's novel *The Once and Future King* is \"Harry's spiritual ancestor\".[4] Finally, she established Harry's birth date as 31 July, the same as her own.

Rowling states that she was born on 19 September 1979[2] and she was nearly twelve when she first attended Hogwarts.[5] She is an overachiever who excels academically and is described by Rowling as a \"very logical, upright and good\" character.[6] Rowling adds that Hermione's parents, two Muggle dentists, are a bit bemused by their odd daughter but \"quite proud of her all the same\".[6] They are well aware of the wizard world and have visited Diagon Alley with her.[7] Hermione is an only child.[6] But Rowling revealed in a 2004 interview that Hermione was originally intended to have a sister, but the planned sibling did not appear since she felt it \"might be too late now\" to introduce the character.[8] Rowling has called the character of Luna Lovegood the \"anti-Hermione\" as they are so very different.[9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Hermione Jean Granger** (/hɜːrˈmaɪəni ˈɡreɪndʒər/ *hur-MY-ə-nee GRAYN-jər*) is a fictional character in J. K. Rowling's *Harry Potter* series. She first appears in the novel *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone* (1997), on the Hogwarts express as a first year student on her way to Hogwarts. After Harry and Ron save her from a mountain troll in the girls' restroom, she becomes best friends with them and often uses her quick wit, deft recall, and encyclopaedic knowledge to lend aid in dire situations. Rowling has stated that Hermione resembles herself as a young girl, with her insecurity and fear of failure.[2]\n\n\nThe character has had immense popularity. The version of Hermione portrayed by Emma Watson in all eight *Harry Potter* films from *Philosopher's Stone* in 2001 to *Deathly Hallows – Part 2* in 2011 was voted the best female character of all time in a poll conducted amongst Hollywood professionals by *The Hollywood Reporter* in 2016.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## Character development[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| *Harry Potter*(cast · music) | * *The Philosopher's Stone*\n\t+ soundtrack, \"Hedwig's Theme\"\n* *The Chamber of Secrets*\n\t+ soundtrack\n* *The Prisoner of Azkaban*\n\t+ soundtrack\n* *The Goblet of Fire*\n\t+ soundtrack\n* *The Order of the Phoenix*\n\t+ soundtrack\n* *The Half-Blood Prince*\n\t+ soundtrack\n* *The Deathly Hallows – Part 1*\n\t+ production\n\t+ soundtrack\n* *The Deathly Hallows – Part 2*\n\t+ production\n\t+ soundtrack\n\t+ accolades\n |\n| *Fantastic Beasts*(cast · characters) | * *Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them*\n\t+ soundtrack\n* *The Crimes of Grindelwald*\n\t+ soundtrack\n* *The Secrets of Dumbledore*\n |\n\n |\n| Characters | * Harry Potter\n* Ron Weasley\n* Hermione Granger\n* Lord Voldemort\n* Albus Dumbledore\n* Severus Snape\n* Rubeus Hagrid\n* Minerva McGonagall\n* Draco Malfoy\n* Neville Longbottom\n* Ginny Weasley\n* Fred and George Weasley\n* Sirius Black\n* Remus Lupin\n* Cedric Diggory\n* Bellatrix Lestrange\n* Dolores Umbridge\n* Luna Lovegood\n* Supporting characters\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n12. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Hermione Jean Granger's name is more a reflection of her parents than her own personality\". *Insider*. 15 November 2018.

Moreover, they are far from rich, and are looked down upon by snobbish \"old families\" such as the Malfoys. All of the Weasleys have been sorted into Gryffindor House at Hogwarts. All of the Weasley children, except Bill and Percy who both were Head Boy, are known to have played on the Gryffindor Quidditch team, with Charlie being the captain of the team for at least one of his school years. Bill, Charlie, and Ron were also chosen as the prefect of their House. The Weasleys also all work for the Order of the Phoenix, and all are members except for Ron, Percy, and Ginny, who (as of the end of *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows*) are not known to have officially been inducted into the Order. \n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_xKhAwDqTvfOOtZ9nlJVpD1R7","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
