The five sports included are tennis, baseball, bowling, golf, and boxing. Players use the Wii Remote to mimic actions performed in real-life sports, such as swinging a tennis racket.[1] The rules for each game are simplified to make them more accessible to new players. The game also features training and fitness modes that monitor players' progress in the sports.[2]\n\n\n*Wii Sports* was well-received by critics and audiences.[3] It was a huge commercial success, selling 82 million copies worldwide, becoming the best-selling video game produced by Nintendo in the world.[3] It has been featured on television in Wii commercials, news reports, and other programming.[4][5][6][7] The game has become a popular means for social gatherings and competitions among players of varying ages.[5][8][9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n2006 sports video game published by Nintendo\n\nThis article is about the video game. For the series, see *Wii Sports* (series).\n\n\n\n\n\n2006 video game\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n*Wii Sports* consists of five separate sports games—tennis, baseball, bowling, golf, and boxing—accessed from the main menu.[10][11] The games use the motion sensor capabilities of the Wii Remote to control the player's dominant arm and/or the appropriate sports equipment it wields. Boxing utilizes both Wii Remote and Nunchuk gestures to control both of the player's arms. The player moves the remote in a similar manner to how the separate games are played in real life; for example, holding and swinging the Wii Remote like a golf club, baseball bat, tennis racket or bowling ball.[1] Some aspects of the gameplay are computer controlled. In tennis, player movement is controlled by the game's AI, while the swinging of the racket is controlled by the player. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nKatsuya Eguchi, who managed Software Development Group 2 at Nintendo Entertainment Analysis and Development, produced *Wii Sports*.[15] With the Wii, Nintendo desired to reach people who had not played video games before. To do this they needed software that allowed both long time and first time players to interact together in a fun way.[16] Nintendo also wanted players to use the system daily and intended the game to be the console's flagship title to help accomplish this.[17] *Wii Sports* was designed as a simple introductory line meant to offer something for both gamers and non-gamers.[18] Sports were chosen as the theme because of the widespread familiarity with them. Rather than feature professional athletes or have realistic graphics, the game was designed to be simple so that anyone could play. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n*Wii Sports*, a major factor in the Wii's worldwide success,[82] was the first game among a number of core Wii games being developed at the same time, with the same philosophy; other games were released as *Wii Play*, *Wii Fit*, and *Wii Music*.[83] A direct sequel to *Wii Sports*, titled *Wii Sports Resort*, was released in 2009.[84] The game, along with *Wii Fit*, has been credited with attracting more casual, female, and elderly gamers.[85] It has also been cited as a game that can provide a bonding experience among family members, and as a means of exercising and losing weight when played regularly.[86][87] A study involving 13- to 15‑year-old teenagers was conducted by the Liverpool John Moores University and concluded that players used 2% more energy than by playing on other consoles. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)A picture of a Wii Sports disc\n***Wii Sports*** is a 2006 sports simulation video game developed and published by Nintendo for the Wii video game console. The 1.0 (pre-release) version of the game was released in North America along with the Wii on November 19, 2006, and the 1.1 version was released in Japan, Australia, Europe, and North America over the following months. It was included as a pack-in game with the console in all territories except Japan, making it the first sports game included with the launch of a Nintendo system since *Mario's Tennis* for the Virtual Boy in 1995. The game is available on its own as part of the Nintendo Selects collection of games.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nGameplay like running towards a ball in tennis was excluded to maintain simplicity.[15] At one point in development, Super Mario characters were used, but were removed from the game because of feedback from players who preferred Miis.[19] The game supports a 16:9 widescreen ratio and progressive scan, runs at 60 frames per second,[10] and makes use of the Wii Remote's accelerometer to interpret the player's motion.[20] Motion-sensing actions, like pitching and hitting, were prioritized to make them as realistic as possible.[19] Because Nintendo did not expect players to purchase the Wii solely to play *Wii Sports*, they bundled the game with the console; Nintendo believed players would be more likely to play *Wii Sports* through this distribution method. They also felt players that enjoyed the game would increase its popularity by word of mouth.[21]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSee also: Wii (video game series) § Wii Sports\n\n### *Wii Sports Resort*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Wii Sports Resort\n\nA sequel, *Wii Sports Resort*, was first revealed at Nintendo's E3 2008 presentation.[110] Development moved forward after the extent of the Wii MotionPlus was realized, though the idea for a sequel existed sooner.[111] The game features 12 sports, (2 from the original) including swordplay, wakeboarding, Frisbee, archery, basketball, table tennis, golf, bowling, power cruising, canoeing, cycling, and air sports (parachuting and piloting).[112] The game was first released in South Korea on June 24, 2009[113] and in Japan on June 25, 2009[114] before being released in other markets in July 2009. As of March 2020, the game has sold over 30 million units, and is a fan-favorite for kids all across the globe.[115][116][117]\n\n\n\n### *Wii Sports Club*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Wii Sports Club\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBefore the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) Media and Business Summit of 2006, the first sport in the game was announced as *Wii Sports: Tennis*. It was later announced, at Nintendo's press conference prior to E3 2006, it would be part of a sports package.[20] Satoru Iwata introduced this package as *Wii Sports*, and stated it would include tennis, golf, and baseball. The game was featured as both a video demonstration and an on-stage playable demo. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n*Wii* series\n |\n| --- |\n| *Wii Sports* | * *Wii Sports*\n* *Resort*\n* *Club*\n* *Nintendo Switch Sports*\n | ![](image)\n |\n| *Wii Fit* | * *Wii Fit*\n* *U*\n |\n| Standalone games | * *Play*\n* *Play: Motion*\n* *Party*\n* *Party U*\n* *Chess*\n* *Music*\n |\n| Related | * Mii\n* Wii\n* Wii Balance Board\n* Wii MotionPlus\n* Wii U\n* *Super Smash Bros.*\n\t+ *for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U*\n\t+ *Ultimate*\n |\n| * ![](image) **Category**\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** \"Review: Wii Sports\". *GamePro*.

For the franchise, see *Minecraft* (franchise). For other uses, see Minecraft (disambiguation).\n\n\n\n\n\n2011 video game\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSocial media sites such as YouTube, Facebook, and Reddit played a significant role in popularizing *Minecraft*.[333] Research conducted by the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg School of Communication showed that one-third of *Minecraft* players learned about the game via Internet videos.[334] In 2010, *Minecraft*-related videos began to gain influence on YouTube, often made by commentators. The videos usually contain screen-capture footage of the game and voice-overs.[335] Common coverage in the videos includes creations made by players, walkthroughs of various tasks, and parodies of works in popular culture. By May 2012, over four million *Minecraft*-related YouTube videos had been uploaded.[336] The game would go on to be a prominent fixture within YouTube's gaming scene during the entire 2010s; in 2014, it was the second-most searched term on the entire platform.[337] By 2018, it was still YouTube's biggest game globally.[338]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n*Minecraft* has received critical acclaim, winning several awards and being cited by some as one of the greatest video games ever created. Social media, parodies, adaptations, merchandise, and the annual Minecon conventions played prominent roles in popularizing the game. The game has also been used in educational environments to teach chemistry, computer-aided design, and computer science. In 2014, Mojang and the *Minecraft* intellectual property were purchased by Microsoft for US$2.5 billion. Several spin-offs have also been made, including *Minecraft: Story Mode*, *Minecraft Earth*, *Minecraft Dungeons*, and the most recent release, *Minecraft Legends*.\n\n\n\n\n## Gameplay[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)*Minecraft* being played in an educational setting\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n*Minecraft* is a 3D sandbox game that has no required goals to accomplish, allowing players a large amount of freedom in choosing how to play the game.[18] However, there is an achievement system,[19] known as \"advancements\" in the *Java Edition* of the game, \"trophies\" on the PlayStation ports, and \"achievements\" in *Bedrock Edition* and the Xbox ports.[20] Gameplay is in the first-person perspective by default, but players have the option of a third-person perspective.[21] The game world is composed of rough 3D objects—mainly cubes and fluids, and commonly called \"blocks\"—representing various materials, such as dirt, stone, ores, tree trunks, water, and lava. The core gameplay revolves around picking up and placing these objects. These blocks are arranged in a 3D grid, while players can move freely around the world. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn *Minecraft*, players explore a blocky, procedurally generated, three-dimensional world with virtually infinite terrain. Players can discover and extract raw materials, craft tools and items, and build structures, earthworks, and machines. Depending on their chosen game mode, players can fight hostile mobs, as well as cooperate with or compete against other players in the same world. Game modes include a survival mode (in which players must acquire resources to build in the world and maintain health) and a creative mode (in which players have unlimited resources and access to flight). The game's large community also offers a wide variety of user-generated content, such as modifications, servers, skins, texture packs, and custom maps, which add new game mechanics and possibilities.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n327. **^** Stuart, Keith; MacDonald, Keza (19 September 2019). \"The 50 best video games of the 21st century\". *The Guardian*.

Set within the fictional state of San Andreas, based on Southern California, the single-player story follows three protagonists—retired bank robber Michael De Santa, street gangster Franklin Clinton, and drug dealer and gunrunner Trevor Philips—and their attempts to commit heists while under pressure from a corrupt government agency and powerful criminals. The open world design lets players freely roam San Andreas's open countryside and the fictional city of Los Santos, based on Los Angeles.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Rockstar North (17 September 2013). *Grand Theft Auto V* (PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360).

Editor Ryan McCaffrey considered that the open world's scale and detail succeeded the majority of other Xbox 360 games. He called the game \"a triumph both for gamers and for the medium itself, and it deserves its runaway success\".[237] In November 2013, *Hardcore Gamer* placed the game third on their \"Top 100 Games of the Generation\" list. \n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_F56SUS6Pjjrjb6rBncOoY6Iz","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

The game featured gameplay like other *Tetris* titles, with a new soundtrack.\n\n\nThe game reached 100 million paid downloads by 2010, making it the best-selling paid mobile game of all time, and third best-selling game of all time altogether. It was discontinued and rendered inoperative in 2020 after EA's license expired.\n\n\n\n\n## Gameplay[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Tetris\n\n![](image)After completing level 15, Magic mode is completed.\nGameplay was nearly identical in gameplay to other *Tetris* titles, but with a new soundtrack. Players also had the ability to create their own soundtrack for the game using the music library of the iPhone or iPod Touch device on which the game is being played. The game offered two modes of play dubbed \"Marathon\" mode and \"Magic\" mode.[1]\n\n\n\n### Marathon[edit]\n\n\nMarathon mode is the classic version of *Tetris*, where a point system along with number of lines cleared were kept as indicators of progress.[2] The level of speed was chosen prior to starting the mode of gameplay. There were 15 levels total, and like Magic mode, this mode ends after all 15 levels have been completed. Unlike the original version of Tetris, Marathon mode ends after clearing 150 lines. Once Marathon mode ends, the Endless feature becomes unlocked.\n\n\n\n### Magic[edit]\n\n\nMagic mode was an enhanced version of gameplay, where there are fifteen levels of difficulty.[3] Each level of difficulty is incremented by speed and number of lines required to clear the level. Once the number of lines required to clear the level are met, the next level is presented. Upon failure of a level, the game offers players to retry an unlimited number of times. The game allows for pausing of gameplay, which is automatic when a player receives a phone call on an iPhone device. Another element of gameplay in Magic mode is the addition of helper objects that are retrieved throughout levels, which allow players to make minor edits to the puzzle. The special objects become available in the first five levels, and then remain generating upon lines completed and tetriminos placed. There are five special objects, ranging from a magic crayon to blocks converting to bubble popping status.\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nOn December 1, 2011, the iOS version of the game was replaced with a new version, which came with an additional \"Marathon One Touch Mode\" as well as a paid subscription which comes with discounts and premium content.[4]\n\n\nIn January 2020, EA announced that they would retire their mobile version of the game on April 21, 2020, and the game became unplayable after this date, even if the full version was purchased.[5] The Tetris Company instead licensed the rights to N3TWORK to create a new mobile version.[6]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\nReception\n\n\nAggregate scores| Aggregator | Score |\n| --- | --- |\n| GameRankings | iOS: 69%[7] |\n| Metacritic | iOS (2011): 65/100[8]iOS (iPad): 76/100[9] |\n\nEA Mobile's 2011 release of Tetris received heavy criticism for being \"needlessly cumbersome\" in terms of touch controls, and missing (online) multiplayer options were seen as no longer up to current times.[10]\n\n\nBy 2010, the game reached 100 million paid downloads.[11][12]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"EA's 'Tetris' for iPhone \"Works\"\".

The game, which was inspired by the Japanese film *Battle Royale* (2000), is based on previous mods created by Brendan \"PlayerUnknown\" Greene for other games, and expanded into a standalone game under Greene's creative direction. It is the first game in the *PUBG Universe* series.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n*PUBG: Battlegrounds*\n |\n| --- |\n| Games | * *PUBG: Battlegrounds*\n* *PUBG Mobile*\n* *Battlegrounds Mobile India*\n* *New State Mobile*\n |\n| People | * PlayerUnknown\n |\n| Related | * Krafton\n* Tencent\n* Battle royale game\n* *The Callisto Protocol*\n* \"Going Dumb\"\n* \"Ready for Love\"\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFurther, Greene stated there was also the need to establish a format for presenting a *PUBG* match to make it interesting to spectators, which he thought would take some time to develop given the nature of the emergent gameplay, comparing it to established first-person shooters and multiplayer online battle arena esport games.[116] A 20-team, 80-player tournament with a US$200,000 prize pool was organized by Intel in Oakland in November 2017.[117][118]\n\n\n\n## Other games and media[edit]\n\n\nKrafton had looked to expand *PUBG* beyond the core game as to expand the narrative universe. As part of this, *PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds* was quietly rebranded as *PUBG Battlegrounds* around July 2021.[119]\n\n\nStarting in 2020, Krafton released a series of live-action documentaries starring Jonathan Frakes that explored the origins of the game's Battlegrounds. Ahead of the game's Taego expansion in July 2021, Krafton released another live-action short called \"Ground Zero\", featuring Ma Dong-seok (aka Don Lee).[120]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n*PUBG* represents the standalone version of what Greene believes is the \"final version\" of the battle royale concept, incorporating the elements he had designed in previous iterations.[6][33] Faster development was possible with the game engine Unreal Engine 4, compared with *ARMA* and *H1Z1*, which were built with proprietary game engines. Greene acknowledged that implementing the size of the maps in *PUBG* has been one of the challenges with working with Unreal, which was not designed with such maps in mind.[6][12] The game was designed as a mix between the realistic simulation of *ARMA 3* and the arcade-like action focus and player accessibility of *H1Z1*.[5] To prevent in-game cheating, the game uses BattlEye anti-cheating software, which had permanently banned over 13 million players by October 2018.[34][35] BattlEye indicated that 99% of all cheating software for the game was developed in China.[36]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n17. **^** Sung-won, Yoon (April 3, 2017). \"Korean survival shooter tops global game chart\". *The Korea Times*.

PUBG's lawsuit asserts that *Rules of Survival* is \"a copyrightable audio-visual work, individually and/or in combination with other elements of Battlegrounds\", and identified several elements that appear similar in both games. While some of these elements are common features of a battle royale game, PUBG asserted that other elements reference specific facets of *Battlegrounds*, such as references to chicken for winning a game or using cookware as weapons or armor, makes *Rules of Survival* imply a connection to *Battlegrounds*. PUBG seeks both monetary damages and requiring NetEase from further distribution of the games. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBy September 2017, Bluehole's value, as tracked by a firm that tracks private Korean corporations, increased five-fold from June of that year to a value of US$4.6 billion, primarily due to *Battlegrounds*.[56] By December 2017, PUBG Corporation reported that there were more than 30 million players worldwide between the Windows and Xbox versions.[161] The research film SuperData estimated that *Battlegrounds* drew in more than US$712 million in revenue within 2017.[162] By February 2018, the game had sold over thirty million on Steam according to Steam Spy.[163] The following month, Steam's President Gabe Newell stated that the game was the third highest-grossing game of all time on the platform.[164] *PUBG: Battlegrounds* is the best-selling video game on PC and Xbox One as of before release of the PlayStation 4 version, 42 million copies sold on PC and 9 million copies sold on Xbox One.[165][166]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe game received positive reviews from critics, who found that while the game had some technical flaws, it presented new types of gameplay that could be easily approached by players of any skill level and was highly replayable. The game was credited with popularizing the battle royale genre, with a number of unofficial Chinese clones also being produced following its success. The game received several Game of the Year nominations and set seven Guinness World Records, among many other accolades. PUBG Corporation has run several small tournaments and introduced in-game tools to help with broadcasting the game to spectators, as they wish for it to become a popular esport. It has sold over 75 million copies on personal computers and game consoles, is the best-selling video game on PC and Xbox One, and is the fifth best-selling video game of all time. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n*Battlegrounds* won the award for \"Best PC Game\", \"Best Multiplayer\", and \"Best Spectator Game\" at the IGN Best of 2017 Awards,[240][241][242] whereas its other nominations were for \"Game of the Year\"[243] and \"Best Shooter\".[244] It also won the award for \"Best PC Game\" at *Destructoid*'s Game of the Year Awards 2017.[245] The game also won Giant Bomb's \"Best Multiplayer\", \"Best Surprise\", \"Best Debut\", and \"Game of the Year\" awards, and was classified as a runner-up for the \"Best Moment or Sequence\" award for the \"chicken-eating game\".[246][247][248][249] *Eurogamer* ranked *PUBG* fourth on their list of the \"Top 50 Games of 2017\",[250] while *GamesRadar+* ranked it 12th on their list of the 25 Best Games of 2017.[251] *Game Informer* gave it the award each for \"Best Competitive Multiplayer\" and \"Best Shooter\" in their Best of 2017 Awards,[252][253] and also for \"Best Competitive Multiplayer\", \"Best Multiplayer Map\" (Erangel), \"Best Innovation\", \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn part of the game's success in early access, Tencent Games, the largest publisher of video games in China, approached Bluehole that same month with an offer to publish *PUBG* in China.[56] However, the China Audio-Video and Digital Publishing Association issued a statement in October 2017 that discouraged battle royale-style games, stating that they are too violent and deviate from Chinese values of socialism, deeming it harmful to young consumers.[57][58] The following month however, PUBG had reached a formal agreement with the Chinese government to allow the release of the game in the country, with Tencent as the publishing partner.[59] However, some changes were made to make sure it aligned with socialist values and traditional Chinese morals.[60] In South Korea, the game is marketed and distributed by Kakao Games.[61]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWhile still in early access, *Battlegrounds* won the \"Best Multiplayer Game\" and was also nominated for the categories \"Game of the Year\" and \"Best Ongoing Game\" at The Game Awards 2017.[200] The game's nomination for \"Game of the Year\" created some debate, being the first early access title to be named for one of the top industry awards.[201][202] Also, about a month before it was released, the game won \"Best Multiplayer Game\" and \"PC Game of the Year\" at the 35th Golden Joystick Awards,[203] whereas its other nominations were for \"Studio of the Year\" (PUBG Corporation) and \"Ultimate Game of the Year\".[204] It also won the \"Breakout Game of the Year\" award at *PC Gamer*'s end of the year awards,[205] whereas its other nomination was for \"Game of the Year\".[206] *Polygon* ranked the game second on their list of the 50 best games of 2017,[207] and *The Verge* named it one of their 15 Best Games of 2017,[208] while *Entertainment Weekly* ranked it seventh on their \"Best Games of 2017\" list.[209]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n13. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Winkie, Luke (April 7, 2017). \"Meet Brendan 'Playerunknown' Greene, Creator of the Twitch Hit 'Battlegrounds'\". *Glixel*.
