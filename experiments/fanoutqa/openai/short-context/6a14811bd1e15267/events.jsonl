The Kansas City Royals won the 2015 World Series, the St. Louis Blues won the 2019 Stanley Cup Finals, and the Kansas City Chiefs won Super Bowl LIV following the 2019 season.\n\n\n10 years after the 2011 World Series, Ron Washington would finally win a World Series ring after 44 years in MLB, as he served as the third base coach for the Atlanta Braves. In addition, four players from the 2011 Rangers' World Series team later won a world championship with the Boston Red Sox: Mike Napoli and Koji Uehara in 2013, and Ian Kinsler and Mitch Moreland in 2018.\n\n\n\n> \n> \"May the ghosts of 2011 be forever erased!\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n- Rangers radio announcer Eric Nadel, after the Rangers won the 2023 World Series\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Series was noted for its back-and-forth Game 6, in which the Cardinals erased a two-run deficit in the bottom of the 9th inning, then did it again in the 10th. In both innings, the Rangers were one strike away from their first World Series championship. The Cardinals won the game in the 11th inning on a walk-off home run by David Freese, who was named World Series MVP. The Series was also known for the blowout Game 3, in which Cardinals player Albert Pujols hit three home runs, a World Series feat previously accomplished only by Reggie Jackson and Babe Ruth, and subsequently by Pablo Sandoval in 2012. In 2020, ESPN named the 2011 World Series the fifth greatest of all-time.[4]\n\n\nThe Series began on October 19, earlier than the previous season, so that no games would be played in November.[5] The Cardinals enjoyed home-field advantage for the series because the NL won the 2011 All-Star Game 5–1 on July 12.[6] The 2011 World Series was the first World Series to go all seven games since the 2002 Series.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n2011 World Series **(4–3): St. Louis Cardinals (N.L.)** over Texas Rangers (A.L.)\n\n\n\n\n\n \n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **St. Louis Cardinals** | 5 | 2 | 1 | 7 | 5 | 6 | 4 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 38 | 56 | 6\n |\n| Texas Rangers | 4 | 1 | 1 | 4 | 6 | 4 | 4 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 30 | 60 | 8\n |\n| **Total attendance:** 342,878   **Average attendance:** 48,983**Winning player's share:** $323,169.98   **Losing player's share:** $251,515.76[46] |\n\n\n## Broadcasting[edit]\n\n\n### Television[edit]\n\n\nThe series was televised in the United States and Canada by Fox.

They defeated the wild-card Tampa Bay Rays in four games in the American League Division Series. They then defeated the third-seeded Detroit Tigers in six games in the American League Championship Series to reach their second consecutive appearance in the World Series.\n\n\nThe Rangers lost home-field advantage in the World Series as a result of the AL team, managed by Rangers manager Ron Washington, losing the 2011 All-Star Game, when Ranger ace C.

La Russa had previously led the Cardinals (2006) and Oakland Athletics (1989) to World Series championships.
