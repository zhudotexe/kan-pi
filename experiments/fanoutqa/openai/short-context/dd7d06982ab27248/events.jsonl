He was the first winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1901.\n\n\nBorn in Paris, Prudhomme originally studied to be an engineer, but turned to philosophy and later to poetry; he declared it as his intention to create scientific poetry for modern times. In character sincere and melancholic, he was linked to the Parnassus school, although, at the same time, his work displays characteristics of its own.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nPrudhomme was born to a French shopkeeper.[1]\n\n\nPrudhomme attended the Lycée Bonaparte, but eye trouble interrupted his studies. He worked for a while in the Creusot region for the Schneider steel foundry, and then began studying law in a notary's office. The favourable reception of his early poems by the *Conférence La Bruyère* (a student society) encouraged him to begin a literary career.\n\n\n\n## Writing[edit]\n\n\nHis first collection, *Stances et Poèmes* (\"Stanzas and Poems\", 1865), was praised by Sainte-Beuve. It included his most famous poem, *Le vase brisé*. He published more poetry before the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War. This war, which he discussed in *Impressions de la guerre* (1872) and *La France* (1874), permanently damaged his health.\n\n\nDuring his career, Prudhomme gradually shifted from the sentimental style of his first books towards a more personal style which unified the formality of the Parnassus school with his interest in philosophical and scientific subjects. One of his inspirations was clearly Lucretius's *De rerum natura*, whose first book he translated into verse. His philosophy was expressed in *La Justice* (1878) and *Le Bonheur* (1888). The extreme economy of means employed in these poems has, however, usually been judged as compromising their poetical quality without advancing their claims as works of philosophy. He was elected to the Académie française in 1881. Another distinction, *Chevalier de la Légion d’honneur*, was to follow in 1895.\n\n\nAfter *Le Bonheur*, Prudhomme turned from poetry to write essays on aesthetics and philosophy. He published two important essays: *L'Expression dans les beaux-arts* (1884) and *Réflexions sur l'art des vers* (1892), a series of articles on Blaise Pascal in *La Revue des Deux Mondes* (1890), and an article on free will (*La Psychologie du Libre-Arbitre*, 1906) in the *Revue de métaphysique et de morale*.\n\n\n\n## Nobel Prize[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 1901 Nobel Prize in Literature\n\nThe first writer to receive the Nobel Prize for Literature (given \"in special recognition of his poetic composition, which gives evidence of lofty idealism, artistic perfection and a rare combination of the qualities of both heart and intellect\"), he devoted the bulk of the money he received to the creation of a poetry prize awarded by the *Société des gens de lettres*. He also founded, in 1902, the *Société des poètes français* with Jose-Maria de Heredia and Leon Dierx.\n\n\n\n## Death[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Grave of Sully Prudhomme at Père-Lachaise in Paris.\nAt the end of his life, his poor health (which had troubled him ever since 1870) forced him to live almost as a recluse at Châtenay-Malabry, suffering attacks of paralysis while continuing to work on essays. He died suddenly on 6 September 1907, and was buried at Père-Lachaise in Paris.\n\n\n\n## Bibliography[edit]\n\n\n### Poetry[edit]\n\n\n* 1865: *Stances et poèmes*\n* 1866: *Les épreuves*\n* 1868: *Croquis italiens*\n* 1869: *Les solitudes: poésies* [*Les écuries d’Augias*]\n* 1872: *Les destins*\n* 1874: *La révolte des fleurs*\n* 1874: *La France*\n* 1875: *Les vaines tendresses*\n* 1876: *Le zénith*, previously published in *Revue des deux mondes*\n* 1878: *La justice*\n* 1865–1888: *Poésie*\n* 1886: *Le prisme, poésies diverses*\n* 1888: *Le bonheur*\n* 1908: *Épaves*\n\n\n### Prose[edit]\n\n\n* 1883–1908: *Œuvres de Sully Prudhomme* (poetry and prose), 8 volumes, A.

It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the 1895 will of Alfred Nobel, which are awarded for outstanding contributions in chemistry, physics, literature, peace, and physiology or medicine.[1] As dictated by Nobel's will, the award is administered by the Nobel Foundation and awarded by the Swedish Academy.[2] The first Nobel Prize in Literature was awarded in 1901 to Sully Prudhomme of France.[3] Each recipient receives a medal, a diploma and a monetary award prize that has varied throughout the years.[4] In 1901, Prudhomme received 150,782 SEK, which is equivalent to 8,823,637.78 SEK in January 2018.

The oldest laureate to receive the prize was Doris Lessing, who was 88 when she was awarded in 2007. It has been awarded posthumously once, to Erik Axel Karlfeldt in 1931.[7] When he received the award in 1958, Russian-born Boris Pasternak was forced to publicly reject the award under pressure from the government of the Soviet Union. In 1964, Jean-Paul Sartre made known that he did not wish to accept the Nobel Prize in Literature,[8] as he had consistently refused all official honors in the past.[9] However the Nobel committee does not acknowledge refusals, and includes Pasternak and Sartre in its list of Nobel laureates.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n14. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Nobel Prize in Literature 1949\".

He was awarded the 1904 Nobel Prize in Literature \"in recognition of the numerous and brilliant compositions which, in an individual and original manner, have revived the great traditions of the Spanish drama\".\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nHe was born in Madrid on 19 April 1832.[2] His father, a doctor and institute professor of Greek,[3] was from Aragon and his mother was from Navarra. He spent his childhood in Murcia, where he finished his elementary school education. It was there, at the Murcia Institute, where he first gained his love for mathematics. While still a child he read Goethe, Homer, and Balzac, readings that alternated with those of mathematicians like Gauss, Legendre, and Lagrange.\n\n\nIn order to earn enough money to attend the *Escuela Técnica Superior de Ingeniería de Caminos, Canales y Puertos* (Engineering School of Roads, Channels and Ports), he moved at the age of fourteen to Madrid.[4] At the age of twenty, he left the Madrid School with a Civil Engineering degree, which he had obtained as first in his class, and he had to move to Almeria and Granada to begin working at his first job.[5]\n\n\n\n## Professor and scientist[edit]\n\n\nIn 1854 he began teaching a class at the Engineering School, working as a secretary there also. He taught mathematics, stereotomy, hydraulics, descriptive geometry, and differential and physical calculus from that year until 1868. From 1858 to 1860 he was also a professor at the Assistants' School of Public Works.\n\n\nHis *Problemas de geometría analítica* (1865) and *Teorías modernas de la física. Unidad de las fuerzas materiales* (1867) were held in some regard. He became a member of the Society of Political Economy, helped to found the magazine *La Revista*, and took a prominent part in propagating free trade doctrines in the press and on the platform.[5]\n\n\nHe was clearly marked out for office, and when the revolution of 1868 overthrew the monarchy, he resigned his post for a place in the revolutionary cabinet.[5]\n\n\n\n## Government service[edit]\n\n\nEchegaray also entered politics later in his life. As a founding member of the republican Radical Democratic Party,[6] he enjoyed a career in the government sector, being appointed Minister of Education, of Public Works and Finance Minister successively between 1867 and 1874.[3] He retired from politics after the Bourbon restoration in 1874.[5]\n\n\n\n## Literary career[edit]\n\n\nTheater had always been the love of José Echegaray's life. Although he had written earlier plays (*La Hija natural* and *La Última Noche*, both in 1867), he truly became a dramatist in 1874.[5] His plays reflected his sense of duty, which had made him famous during his time in the governmental offices. Dilemmas centered on duty and morality are the motif of his plays. He replicated the achievements of his predecessors of the Spanish Golden Age, remaining a prolific playwright.\n\n\nHis most famous play is *El gran Galeoto*, a drama written in the grand nineteenth century manner of melodrama. It is about the poisonous effect that unfounded gossip has on a middle-aged man's happiness. Echegaray filled it with elaborate stage instructions that illuminate what we would now consider a hammy style of acting popular in the 19th century. Paramount Pictures filmed it as a silent with the title changed to *The World and His Wife*, and it was the basis for a later film The Great Galeoto. His most remarkable plays[*citation needed*] are *O locura o santidad* (Saint or Madman?, 1877); *Mariana* (1892); *El estigma* (1895); *La duda*, 1898; and *El loco Dios* (God, the fool, 1900).\n\n\nAmong his other famous plays are *La esposa del vengador* (1874) (The Avenger's Wife); *En el puño de la espada* (1875) (In the Sword's Handle); *En el pilar y en la cruz* (1878) (On the Stake and on the Cross); and *Conflicto entre dos deberes* (1882) (Conflict of Two Duties).[3]\n\n\nAlong with the Provençal poet Frédéric Mistral, he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1904, after having been nominated that year by a member of the Royal Spanish Academy, making him the first Spaniard to win the prize.[7]\n\n\n\n![](image)José Echegaray\nJosé Echegaray maintained constant activity until his death on 14 September 1916 in Madrid.[2] His extensive work did not stop growing in his old age: in the final stage of his life he wrote 25 or 30 mathematical physics volumes. At the age of 83 he commented: \n\n\n> I cannot die, because if I am going to write my mathematical physics encyclopedia, I need at least 25 more years.\n> \n> \n\n\n## Honors[edit]\n\n\nSeveral streets in Spain are named after José Echegaray. *Calle Echegaray* in Madrid's *Barrio de las Letras* is especially noteworthy.[8][9] In 1971 the Bank of Spain issued a 1000-peseta banknote in his honor.[10]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Burell was elected for the position in 1916 but never took the seat\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"José Echegaray y Eizaguirre - Spanish dramatist\". *Britannica.com*.
