It includes a list of all women who have served in the Senate, a list of current female senators, and a list of states represented by women in the Senate. The first female U.S. senator, Rebecca Latimer Felton, represented Georgia for a single day in 1922, and the first woman elected to the Senate, Hattie Caraway, was elected from Arkansas in 1932. Sixty women have served in the upper house of the United States Congress since its establishment in 1789. As of October 3, 2023, there are 25 women (15 Democrats, 9 Republicans, and 1 Independent) serving as U.S. senators.\n\n\nNancy Kassebaum is currently the oldest living former female member of the Senate at the age 91.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSixty women have served in the United States Senate since its establishment in 1789.[17] Cumulatively, 36 female U.S. senators have been Democrats, while 23 have been Republicans and one is an independent. As of 2023, no female U.S. senator has ever won election to the House after her Senate term, resigned from a state governorship for the purpose of a Senate appointment by her successor, also won election as an independent or to represent more than one state in non-consecutive elections, served both seats of a state at different times, or represented a third party in her career. In December 2022, Senator Kyrsten Sinema became the first female senator to switch her party affiliation while in office. In September 2023, Senator Dianne Feinstein became the first female senator to die in office.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| ![Sen.

Fifteen are Democrats, nine are Republicans, and one is an independent.\n\n\nIn January 2019, four new women senators (Blackburn, McSally, Rosen, and Sinema) were seated although two others (Heitkamp and McCaskill) lost reelection bids, so the number of female senators reached 25, at the time with 17 being Democrats and 8 being Republicans. In January 2020, Kelly Loeffler was appointed to the Senate from Georgia, increasing the number of women in the Senate to 26, the highest proportion of women serving as U.S. senators in history.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Rebecca Latimer Felton (D-Georgia), the first female member of the United States Senate, who served for a single day in 1922.\n![](image)One woman (Barbara Mikulski) was reelected and four women were elected to the Senate in 1992, the \"Year of the Woman,\" Left to right: Senators Murray, Moseley Braun, Mikulski, Feinstein, and Boxer.\n![](image)By the 111th United States Congress (2009\u20132011), the number of women senators had increased to 17, including 4 Republicans and 13 Democrats\nFor its first 130 years in existence, the Senate's membership was entirely male. Until 1920, few women ran for the Senate. Until the 1990s, very few were elected. This paucity of women was due to many factors, including the lack of women's suffrage in many states until the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, women's limited access to higher education until the mid-1900s, public perceptions of gender roles, and barriers to women's advancement such as sex discrimination.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nClinton joined the Senate in 2001, becoming the first female senator from New York, and served until 2009, when she resigned to become the 67th United States Secretary of State, under President Barack Obama. She was replaced by Kirsten Gillibrand, who has been elected three times and was herself a candidate for president in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries.\n\n\nIn 2008, Kay Hagan became the first woman to unseat a female incumbent, Elizabeth Dole. Upon the opening of the 112th United States Congress in 2011, New Hampshire Democrat Jeanne Shaheen was joined by newly elected Republican Kelly Ayotte, making up the first Senate delegation of two women belonging to different parties.\n\n\nIn November 2022, Dianne Feinstein became the longest-serving female senator in history,[8] surpassing Barbara Mikulski,[9][10] having served for 30 years.[11] Feinstein was retiring at the end of her last term, scheduled for January 3, 2025,[12] but died on September 29, 2023, before her term ended.[13]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 2016, she ran a successful campaign for her party's presidential nomination, eventually losing in the general election to Republican nominee Donald Trump.\n\n\nAnother famous name is Nancy Landon Kassebaum (R-KS), the daughter of former Kansas governor and one-time presidential candidate Alf Landon. After retiring from the Senate, she married former senator Howard Baker (R-TN). Kassebaum has the distinction of being the first female elected senator who did not succeed her husband in Congress (Margaret Chase Smith was only elected to the Senate after succeeding her husband to his House seat).\n\n\nAmong the women elected or appointed in Senate history, by stature, Barbara Boxer (D-CA) and Barbara Mikulski (D-MD) are the shortest, at 4\u00a0feet 11\u00a0inches (1.50\u00a0m), whereas Kelly Loeffler (R-GA) is the tallest, at 5\u00a0feet 11\u00a0inches (1.80\u00a0m).[18][19][20]\n\n\n\n## List of female U.S. senators[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSome female U.S. senators have later run for U.S. president or vice president\u2014see list of female United States presidential and vice presidential candidates. In 2020, Kamala Harris became the first female senator, current or past, to win her vice presidential election bid and become the first female President of the United States Senate in American history.\n\n\n\n## Election, selection, and family[edit]\n\n\nBefore 2001, a plurality of women joined the U.S. Senate through appointment following the death or resignation of a husband or father who previously held the seat. An example is Muriel Humphrey (D-MN), the widow of former senator and Vice President Hubert Humphrey; she was appointed to fill his seat until a special election was held (in which she did not run). However, with the election of three women in 2000, the balance shifted; more women have now entered service as a senator by winning elections than by being appointed.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe first time two female senators from the same state served concurrently was beginning in 1993; Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer (both D-CA) were both elected in 1992, with Feinstein taking office that same year (as the result of a special election) and Boxer taking office in 1993; Boxer served until 2016, when she retired, and Feinstein was joined by Kamala Harris. In June 1993, Kay Bailey Hutchison won a special election in Texas, and joined Kassebaum as a fellow female Republican senator. These additions significantly diminished the popular perception of the Senate as an exclusive \"boys' club\". Since 1992, there has been at least one new woman elected to the Senate every two years, with the exception of 2004 (Lisa Murkowski was elected for the first time in 2004, but had been appointed to the seat since 2002). \n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | Shelley Moore Capito | Republican | West Virginia House of Delegates, U.S. House of Representatives\n | 2015\n(age 62)\n | 1953\n |\n| 1\n | Wisconsin\n | Tammy Baldwin | Democratic | Wisconsin State Assembly, U.S. House of Representatives\n | 2013\n(age 51)\n | 1962\n |\n| 2\n | Wyoming\n | Cynthia Lummis | Republican | Wyoming House of Representatives, Wyoming Senate, Wyoming Treasurer, U.S. House of Representatives\n | 2021\n(age 66)\n | 1954\n |\n\n\n## List of states represented by women[edit]\n\n\nThirty-three states have been represented by female senators.

The first woman to be elected to the Senate without any family connections was Florida Republican Paula Hawkins, elected in 1980. She was also the first and, to date, only female member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints elected to the United States Senate. In 1990, there were still few women in the Senate as compared to the number of women in the House. The trend of few women in the Senate began to change in the wake of the Clarence Thomas Supreme Court nomination hearings and the subsequent election of the 103rd United States Congress in 1992, which was dubbed the \"Year of the Woman.\"[1] Barbara Mikulski was reelected and four new Democratic women were elected to the Senate. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Eight Democratic women senators appear at the 2008 Democratic Convention in Denver. It has become a tradition at Democratic conventions for incumbent women senators to appear on opening night.Olympia Snowe of Maine arrived in the Senate in 1995, having previously served in the US House of Representatives and both houses of the Maine state legislature. She and later Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, and Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming are the only women to have served in both houses of a state legislature and both houses of the federal legislature. In 2000, Stabenow and Maria Cantwell became the first women to defeat incumbent *elected* senators in a general election, unseating Senators Spencer Abraham and Slade Gorton respectively.[n 2] Hillary Clinton is the first and only First Lady to run for or win a Senate seat. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMartha McSally lost an election to finish John McCain's unexpired term on November 3, 2020, and left the Congress on December 2, which reduced the number of female senators to 25. On January 3, 2021, Cynthia Lummis, the first woman senator from Wyoming, began her term, so the number of female senators reached 26 once again. Meanwhile, Kamala Harris was elected Vice President of the United States; she resigned her Senate seat on January 18 in anticipation of the scheduled commencement of her term as Vice President (and thus President of the Senate) on January 20, which reduced the number of female senators to 25. In addition, Loeffler lost the January 5 special election runoff for the remainder of the term to which she had been appointed, and she left office also on January 20, which further reduced the number of women serving in the Senate to 24. \n</fragment>\n</document>",

It includes a list of all women who have served in the Senate, a list of current female senators, and a list of states represented by women in the Senate. The first female U.S. senator, Rebecca Latimer Felton, represented Georgia for a single day in 1922, and the first woman elected to the Senate, Hattie Caraway, was elected from Arkansas in 1932. Sixty women have served in the upper house of the United States Congress since its establishment in 1789. As of October 3, 2023, there are 25 women (15 Democrats, 9 Republicans, and 1 Independent) serving as U.S. senators.\n\n\nNancy Kassebaum is currently the oldest living former female member of the Senate at the age 91.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHistory of female representation in the US Senate\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| This article is part of a series on the |\n| United States Senate |\n| ![Great Seal of the United States Senate](image)Great Seal of the United States Senate |\n| History of the United States Senate |\n| \nMembers |\n| * Current members + (by seniority\n\t+ by class)\n* Former members\n* Hill committees + (DSCC\n\t+ NRSC)\n* Women in the Senate\n\n\n\n---\n\n* United States Vice President (list)\n* President pro tempore (list)\n* Presiding officer\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSixty women have served in the United States Senate since its establishment in 1789.[17] Cumulatively, 36 female U.S. senators have been Democrats, while 23 have been Republicans and one is an independent. As of 2023, no female U.S. senator has ever won election to the House after her Senate term, resigned from a state governorship for the purpose of a Senate appointment by her successor, also won election as an independent or to represent more than one state in non-consecutive elections, served both seats of a state at different times, or represented a third party in her career. In December 2022, Senator Kyrsten Sinema became the first female senator to switch her party affiliation while in office. In September 2023, Senator Dianne Feinstein became the first female senator to die in office.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn December 9, 2022, Sinema defected from the Democratic Party to become a registered independent, leaving 15 of her fellow women senators from her former party, and on January 3, 2023, Katie Britt, the first Republican woman senator from Alabama and also the first woman ever elected to the Senate from her state, began her term as well, increasing the number to 25 again. The death of Dianne Feinstein on September 29, 2023, brought the number back down to 24. The seating of Feinstein's replacement, appointed senator Laphonza Butler, on October 3 returned the figure to 25.\n\n\nAs of January 2023, four states (Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, and Washington) are represented by two female U.S. senators. Eleven incumbent women in the Senate are former U.S. representatives: Senators Stabenow, Cantwell, Gillibrand, Baldwin, Hirono, Moore Capito, Duckworth, Sinema, Rosen, Blackburn, and Lummis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nClinton joined the Senate in 2001, becoming the first female senator from New York, and served until 2009, when she resigned to become the 67th United States Secretary of State, under President Barack Obama.

In June 1993, Kay Bailey Hutchison won a special election in Texas, and joined Kassebaum as a fellow female Republican senator. These additions significantly diminished the popular perception of the Senate as an exclusive \"boys' club\". Since 1992, there has been at least one new woman elected to the Senate every two years, with the exception of 2004 (Lisa Murkowski was elected for the first time in 2004, but had been appointed to the seat since 2002). \n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Upon the February 2017 resignation of Jeff Sessions to become United States Attorney General, she became the most senior junior senator. She is the second female senator from Washington, after Patty Murray.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life, education, and early political career[edit]\n\n\nCantwell was born in Indianapolis, Indiana. She was raised in a predominantly Irish American neighborhood on the south side of Indianapolis. Her father, Paul Cantwell,[2] served as county commissioner, city councilor, state legislator, and chief of staff for U.S. Representative Andrew Jacobs Jr.;[2] he was the Democratic nominee for Mayor of Indianapolis in 1979.[3] Her mother, Rose, was an administrative assistant.

Others argued that due to the state's unique economy, any senator from Washington almost had to vote for free trade pacts.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAmerican politician and businesswoman (born 1958)\n\nNot to be confused with Mary Cantwell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1986, Cantwell was elected to the Washington State House of Representatives at the age of 28.[10] She defeated George Dahlquist 54%\u201346%.[11] In 1988, she was reelected with 66% of the vote.[12] In 1990, she was reelected to a third term with 61% of the vote.[13]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\nAs a state representative, Cantwell helped write Washington's Growth Management Act of 1990, which required cities to develop comprehensive growth plans, and she negotiated its passage.[14][15] She also worked on legislation regulating nursing homes. Cantwell resigned on January 3, 1993, in preparation to be sworn in as a member of the United States House of Representatives.\n\n\n\n### Committee assignments[edit]\n\n\n[16]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCantwell attended Emmerich Manual High School, and was inducted into the Indianapolis Public Schools Hall of Fame in 2006.[4] After high school, Cantwell attended Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, where she earned her Bachelor of Arts degree in public administration.[5]\n\n\nA year after graduating, Cantwell worked on Jerry Springer's unsuccessful 1982 Ohio gubernatorial campaign.[6] Cantwell moved to Seattle, Washington, in 1983, to campaign for U.S. Senator Alan Cranston (D-CA) in his unsuccessful bid for the 1984 Democratic presidential nomination.[6][5] She then moved to the Seattle suburb of Mountlake Terrace, because it reminded her of Indianapolis,[7] and led a successful campaign in 1986 to build a new library there.[8] As of 2000, Cantwell lived in Edmonds, Washington with her mother.[9]\n\n\n\n## Washington House of Representatives (1987\u20131993)[edit]\n\n\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Cantwell (seated in the middle of the couch) with other female Senators of the 110th Congress, which served from 2007 until 2009.\nDuring the 2006 campaign, Cantwell received heavy criticism for declining most of the invitations she received to debate McGavick in public fora. Media outlets across the state, including *The Olympian* and the *Yakima Herald-Republic*, rebuked her, claiming she was afraid to confront McGavick, calling it \"unacceptable\"[57] and \"simply not fair\". Cantwell agreed to two debates with McGavick in Seattle and Spokane, lasting 60 and 30 minutes, respectively. When she ran for Senate in 2000 against Gorton, Gorton also agreed to only two debates of a similar format. Similarly, when Washington's senior senator, Patty Murray, ran for reelection in 2004, she agreed to only two debates with George Nethercutt, although each debate lasted an hour.[58]\n\n\n\n#### 2012[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2012 United States Senate election in Washington\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n2012 Washington US Senate general election results[121]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n | \u00b1% |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Democratic** | **Maria Cantwell (incumbent)**  | **1,855,493**  | **60.36%**  | **+3.55%**  |\n|  | Republican | Michael Baumgartner | 1,213,924\n | 39.49%\n | -0.42%\n |\n|  | Write-in | 4,644\n | 0.15%\n | +0.08%\n |\n| Total votes\n | **3,074,061**  | **100.0%**  | N/A\n |\n|  | Democratic **hold** |\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Gillibrand won a special election in 2010 to keep the seat, and was reelected to full terms in 2012 and 2018. During her Senate tenure, Gillibrand has shifted to the left. She has been outspoken on sexual assault in the military and sexual harassment, having criticized President Bill Clinton, Senator Al Franken, and Governor Andrew Cuomo, all fellow Democrats, for alleged sexual misconduct. She supports paid family leave, a federal jobs guarantee, and the abolition and replacement of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\n\nGillibrand ran for the Democratic nomination for president of the United States in 2020, officially announcing her candidacy on March 17, 2019. After failing to qualify for the third debate, she withdrew from the race on August 28, 2019.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Hirono won the election, defeating Lingle in a landslide, 63% to 37%. She was sworn in on January 3, 2013, by Vice President Joe Biden. Hirono was the only person of Asian ancestry serving in the U.S. Senate from 2013 until 2017, when senators Tammy Duckworth and Kamala Harris were sworn in, representing Illinois and California, respectively. Although Brian Schatz is Hawaii's senior senator because he joined the Senate a week before Hirono, following the death of Daniel Inouye, Hirono's three terms in the U.S. House of Representatives make her the dean, or longest-serving member overall, of Hawaii's congressional delegation.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n61. **^** Shapiro, Rebecca (July 28, 2017). \"Senator Mazie Hirono Health Care Plea\". *Huffington Post*.

She served as director of the Harvard Institute of Politics before resigning to run for the U.S. Senate again in the 2008 election, defeating Sununu in a rematch. She is the dean of New Hampshire's congressional delegation, serving in Congress since 2009.\n\n\nShaheen became the first Democratic senator from New Hampshire since John A. Durkin, who was defeated in 1980. In 2014, she became the second Democrat from New Hampshire to be reelected to the Senate and the first since Thomas J. McIntyre in 1972. She was reelected to a third term in 2020, defeating Republican nominee Bryant Messner.\n\n\n\n\n## Personal life, education and pre-political career[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n### 2004[edit]\n\n\nAfter a short time teaching at Harvard University (and a fellowship in the Institute of Politics with former Massachusetts Governor Jane Swift), Shaheen was named national chairperson of John Kerry's 2004 presidential campaign in September 2003.\n\n\n\n## U.S. Senate[edit]\n\n\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Shaheen on the campaign trail at Dartmouth College, July 2008\n2002\nMain article: 2002 United States Senate election in New Hampshire\n\nAfter three two-year terms as governor, Shaheen declined to run for a fourth, instead choosing to run for the U.S. Senate in 2002. Republican John E. Sununu defeated her by a 51 percent to 47 percent margin (19,751 votes). In an interview with the *Concord Monitor*, Shaheen attributed her loss in part to \"discussion about the job that [she] did as governor.\" At that time, early Republican advertisements slammed her support for putting a sales tax on the ballot or faulted her for failing schools.[24]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn early July 2007 through UNH, CNN and WMUR put out a poll[28] showing that Shaheen would beat Sununu in the 2008 Senate race (54\u201338). Other Democratic candidates did not have this type of lead, which led many to believe Shaheen would be the best choice to beat Sununu.\n\n\nIn April 2007, Shaheen met with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nevada) and Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee Chairman Chuck Schumer (D-New York) about a Senate run. Both said she would have strong support from the DSCC if she ran. On September 14, 2007, Shaheen announced her candidacy.[29] On September 15, she formally launched her campaign at her home in Madbury, New Hampshire. On September 21, EMILY's List endorsed her campaign.\n\n\nShaheen defeated Sununu 52% to 45% (44,535 votes).\n\n\n\n#### 2014[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2014 United States Senate election in New Hampshire\n\n![](image)Shaheen, Hillary Clinton and Maggie Hassan in November 2014\nShaheen ran for reelection in 2014, facing former Massachusetts Senator Scott Brown.[30]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n47. **^** Buckland, Tim (November 1, 2011). \"Berlin prison gets OK in Senate\". *New Hampshire Union Leader*.

Warren was a candidate in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries, ultimately finishing third.\n\n\nBorn and raised in Oklahoma, Warren is a graduate of the University of Houston and Rutgers Law School and has taught law at several universities, including the University of Houston, the University of Texas at Austin, the University of Pennsylvania, and Harvard University. She was one of the most influential professors in commercial and bankruptcy law before beginning her political career.

She withdrew from the race on March 5, 2020, after Super Tuesday.[12]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWarren has said that she began to vote Democratic in 1995 because she no longer believed that the Republicans were the party who best supported markets, but she has said she has voted for both parties because she believed neither should dominate.[59] According to Warren, she left the Republican Party because it is no longer \"principled in its conservative approach to economics and to markets\" and is instead tilting the playing field in favor of large financial institutions and against middle-class American families.[60][61]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Senate (2013\u2013present)[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Electoral history of Elizabeth Warren\n\n![](image)2012 Senate election results by municipality\n![](image)Senate campaign logo\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\n#### 2012[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2012 United States Senate election in Massachusetts\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n161. **^** Wise, Justin (January 3, 2019). \"Warren on Syria troop pullout: Foreign policy shouldn't be conducted on Twitter\". *The Hill*.

In 2004, she was elected to the Nebraska Legislature, representing the 43rd district for two terms. Fischer ran for the U.S. Senate in 2012 and was initially seen as a long-shot candidate, but pulled off an unexpected victory against state attorney general Jon Bruning in the Republican primary; in the general election, she defeated former Democratic U.S. Senator Bob Kerrey and was the only Republican to flip a Senate seat in the 2012 elections. In 2015, she became the state's senior U.S. senator after Mike Johanns retired.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life, education, and career[edit]\n\n\nFischer was born Debra Lynelle Strobel on March 1, 1951, in Lincoln, Nebraska. She is the daughter of Florence M. (n\u00e9e Bock) and Gerold Carl Strobel.[2][3] Her father was the State Engineer/Director of the Nebraska Department of Roads under Governors Kay Orr and Ben Nelson and her mother was an elementary school teacher with Lincoln Public Schools.[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n12. **^** Bureau, Joseph Morton / World-Herald (January 29, 2015). \"Deb Fischer taps Nebraska companies for transportation hearing\". *Omaha.com*.\n13. **^** \"Investing in Infrastructure | Office of Governor Pete Ricketts\". *governor.nebraska.gov*.\n14. **^** Thayer, John. \"Senator Deb Fischer Files for U.S. Senate\".

A spokesman for the National Right to Life Committee stated that the Nebraska law was stronger than those of other states, which only required that the client be asked if she wanted to see an ultrasound image. The measure passed by a 40\u20135 vote, and was signed into law by Governor Dave Heineman.[11]\n\n\nFischer served as chairwoman for the Transportation and Telecommunications Committee[12] and helped pass the BUILD Nebraska Act through the Unicameral. This bill prioritized a quarter cent of the state sales tax for infrastructure projects.[13]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Senate (2013\u2013present)[edit]\n\n\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\n#### 2012 election[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2012 United States Senate election in Nebraska\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n2018 U.S. Senate primary election results, Nebraska[45]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Republican** | **Deb Fischer (incumbent)**  | **128,157**  | **75.79%**  |\n|  | Republican | Todd F.

Opponents of federal grazing leases argued that she should relinquish her family's permit if she wants to remain \"morally consistent\" with her message of less government. Fischer argued that the poor quality of federal lands, plus the restrictions that come with federal leases, make it inappropriate to compare them to private leases.[17]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn May 28, 2021, Fischer voted against creating an independent commission to investigate the 2021 United States Capitol attack.[40]\n\n\n\n### Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023[edit]\n\n\nFischer was among the 31 Senate Republicans who voted against final passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023.[41]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nFischer and her husband Bruce operate a family ranch, Sunny Slope Ranch, near Valentine, Nebraska. Their adult sons Adam, Morgan, and Luke own the majority of the stock in the family corporation, while the elder Fischers retain a minority share. In 2020, Fischer and her husband moved to Lincoln, Nebraska.[42]\n\n\n\n## Electoral history[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n2012 U.S. Senate primary election results, Nebraska[43]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Republican** | **Deb Fischer**  | **79,941**  | **41.0**  |\n|  | Republican | Jon Bruning\n | 70,067\n | 35.9\n |\n|  | Republican | Don Stenberg\n | 36,727\n | 18.8\n |\n|  | Republican | Pat Flynn\n | 5,413\n | 2.8\n |\n|  | Republican | Spencer Zimmerman\n | 1,601\n | 0.8\n |\n|  | Republican | Sharyn Elander\n | 1,294\n | 0.7\n |\n| Total votes\n | **195,043**  | **100**  |\n\n\n\n\n2012 U.S. Senate general election results, Nebraska[44]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n | \u00b1% |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Republican** | **Deb Fischer**  | **455,593**  | **57.77%**  | **+21.65%**  |\n|  | Democratic | Bob Kerrey | 332,979\n | 42.23%\n | -21.65%\n |\n| Total votes\n | **788,572**  | **100.0%**  | N/A\n |\n|  | Republican **gain** from Democratic |\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2004, Fischer ran for the Nebraska Legislature from the 43rd legislative district in the state's Sandhills region. In the nonpartisan primary, she came in second in a field of seven, receiving 2226 votes (25.1%); front-runner Kevin T. Cooksley received 2264 votes (25.5%). In the general election, she defeated Cooksley with 8178 votes to his 8050, for a margin of 50.4%\u201349.6%.[5]\n\n\nIn 2008, she won re-election unopposed.[6] Nebraska's term-limits law precluded her running for re-election in 2012.[7]\n\n\n**Tenure**\n\n\nFischer's district was geographically the largest in the Nebraska Legislature, comprising 12 counties and part of a 13th.[8] During her tenure in the legislature, she did a weekly radio show on seven stations covering her district, and wrote a weekly column printed in several newspapers.[9]\n\n\nIn 2007, she helped to filibuster a bill that created a statewide smoking ban for indoor workplaces and public places.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n39. **^** \"'This must end now': Nebraska Sen.

Both later served in the Wyoming House of Representatives, one of the few married couples to do so, though Lummis is a Republican and Wiederspahn was a Democrat.[195][196][197] She remained married to Wiederspahn, with whom she had one child, until his death on October 24, 2014.[198]\n\n\nLummis has a net worth of $12.26 million as of 2015, but reported a net worth between $20 million and $75 million from 2007 to 2008.[199][200] She purchased Bitcoin in 2013 on her son-in-law's advice and became the first U.S. senator to own cryptocurrency.[201] Her enthusiasm for the technology led to her being known as Congress's \"Crypto Queen\".[202] Lummis owned at least $230,000 worth of Bitcoin in 2021.[203] She is a Lutheran and adheres to the Lutheran Church \u2013 Missouri Synod (LCMS).[204]\n\n\n\n## Electoral history[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1978, Lummis was elected to the Wyoming House of Representatives at age 24, the youngest woman to serve in the state legislature.[12][13] She was reelected in 1980, but chose to not seek reelection in 1982.[14][15] Lummis returned to the state house after winning the 1984 election.[16][17] She filed to run for reelection on June 19, 1986, and was reelected after placing third out of 18 candidates.[18][19][20] She was reelected in the 1988 and 1990 elections.[21][22] She was reapportioned to the 8th district in 1992.[23]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLummis unsuccessfully sought to be appointed to replace Senator Craig L. Thomas in 2007. She was elected to succeed Barbara Cubin in the U.S. House of Representatives in the 2008 election, defeating Democratic nominee Gary Trauner. During her tenure in the House, she was the first Wyoming representative to serve on the Agriculture Committee since 1941, chaired the Science Subcommittee on Energy, co-chaired the Congressional Caucus for Women's Issues, and was active in the Congressional Western Caucus and Freedom Caucus. She served until her retirement in 2017, and was succeeded by Liz Cheney. After her tenure in the House, Lummis sought a position in President Donald Trump's cabinet as Secretary of the Interior, but was not appointed. She was elected to the U.S. Senate in the 2020 election, becoming the first woman to represent Wyoming in the Senate. She voted to reject the certification of Pennsylvania's electoral votes in the 2020 presidential election, which were narrowly won by Joe Biden.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn June 20, 2019, Lummis filed to run for a seat in the United States Senate to succeed retiring Senator Mike Enzi.[131] She won the Republican nomination and defeated Democratic nominee Merav Ben-David in the general election.[132][133] Her victory made her the first woman to represent Wyoming in the United States Senate.[134] She raised more during the campaign than all of her Republican and Democratic opponents combined.[135] During the campaign Lummis raised $3,003,788 and spent $3,037,813 while Ben-David raised $559,626 and spent $545,348.[136][137]\n\n\n\n#### Tenure[edit]\n\n\nDuring her tenure in the Senate, Lummis has served on the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, Environment and Public Works, and Commerce, Science, and Transportation committees.[138] Hans Hunt, a member of the Wyoming state House, resigned so that he could work as Lummis's agriculture and trade policy adviser.[139]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1990, when Republican Senator Dan Sullivan resigned from the Wyoming Senate, Senate Majority Leader Diemer True stated that Lummis was qualified to replace Sullivan in the state senate. But she could not take the position, as she was busy serving as a campaign manager in the gubernatorial election.[24] In 1992, Lummis ran for a seat in the Wyoming Senate from the 5th district, defeating Norman P. Feagler for the Republican nomination, and incumbent Democratic Senator Harriet Elizabeth Byrd in the general election.[25][26][27] During the campaign Lummis spent $11,661, making her the fifth-highest spending elected candidate in the 1992 election.[28] On June 8, 1994, she announced that she would not run for reelection, saying she had other commitments to her family. Republican nominee Don Lawler was elected to succeed her after defeating Democratic nominee Steve Freudenthal.[29][30]\n\n\n\n#### Tenure[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n118. **^** \"The Hard-Line Republicans Who Pushed John Boehner Out\". *FiveThirtyEight*.

She is the first woman to represent Alaska in the Senate and the Senate's second-most senior Republican woman, after Susan Collins of Maine. She became dean of Alaska's congressional delegation upon Representative Don Young's death.\n\n\nMurkowski is the daughter of former U.S. senator and governor of Alaska Frank Murkowski. Before her appointment to the Senate, she served in the Alaska House of Representatives and was elected majority leader. She was controversially appointed to the Senate by her father, who resigned his seat in December 2002 to become governor of Alaska. She completed her father's unexpired Senate term, which ended in January 2005, and became the first Alaskan-born member of Congress.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"MURKOWSKI, Lisa \u2013 Biographical Information\". bioguide.congress.gov.
