Grosses are not limited to original theatrical runs either, with many older films often being re-released periodically so the figures represent all the business a film has done since its original release; a film's first-run gross is included in brackets after the total if known. Because of incomplete data it cannot be known for sure how much money some films have made and when they made it, but generally the chart chronicles the films from each year that went on to earn the most. In the cases where estimates conflict both films are recorded, and in cases where a film has moved into first place because of being re-released the previous record-holder is also retained.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWhile inflation has eroded the achievements of most films from the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, there are franchises originating from that period that are still active. Besides the *Star Wars* and *Superman* franchises, *James Bond* and *Godzilla* films are still being released periodically; all four are among the highest-grossing franchises. Some of the older films that held the record of highest-grossing film still have respectable grosses by today's standards, but no longer compete numerically against today's top-earners in an era of much higher individual ticket prices. When those prices are adjusted for inflation, however, then *Gone with the Wind*—which was the highest-grossing film outright for twenty-five years—is still the highest-grossing film of all time. All grosses on the list are expressed in U.S. dollars at their nominal value, except where stated otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n## Highest-grossing films[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAt least eleven films have held the record of 'highest-grossing film' since *The Birth of a Nation* assumed the top spot in 1915. Both *The Birth of a Nation* and *Gone with the Wind* spent twenty-five consecutive years apiece as the highest-grosser, with films directed by Steven Spielberg and James Cameron holding the record on three occasions each. Spielberg became the first director to break his own record when *Jurassic Park* overtook *E.T.*, and Cameron emulated the feat when *Avatar* broke the record set by *Titanic*. When it took over the top spot in 2019, *Avengers: Endgame* became the first sequel to hold the record of highest-grossing film, and in doing so interrupted thirty-six years of Spielberg/Cameron dominance before *Avatar* reclaimed the top spot two years later in 2021 upon a re-release.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t* *United & Babson Investment Report*.

Grosses are not limited to original theatrical runs either, with many older films often being re-released periodically so the figures represent all the business a film has done since its original release; a film's first-run gross is included in brackets after the total if known. Because of incomplete data it cannot be known for sure how much money some films have made and when they made it, but generally the chart chronicles the films from each year that went on to earn the most. In the cases where estimates conflict both films are recorded, and in cases where a film has moved into first place because of being re-released the previous record-holder is also retained.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHigh-grossing films by year of release[47][48][49]\n| Year\n | Title\n | Worldwide gross\n | Budget\n | Reference(s)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1915 | *The Birth of a Nation* | $50,000,000–100,000,000$20,000,000+R ($5,200,000)R | $110,000 | [# 84][# 85][# 86] |\n| 1916 | *Intolerance* | $1,750,000R IN | $385,907 | [50][51] |\n| 1917 | *Cleopatra* | $500,000\\*R | $300,000 | [# 87][# 88] |\n| 1918 | *Mickey* | $8,000,000 | $250,000 | [# 89] |\n| 1919 | *The Miracle Man* | $3,000,000R | $120,000 | [# 90] |\n| 1920 | *Way Down East* | $5,000,000R ($4,000,000)R | $800,000 | [# 91][# 92] |\n| 1921 | *The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse* | $5,000,000R ($4,000,000)R | $600,000–800,000 | [# 93] |\n| 1922 | *Douglas Fairbanks in Robin Hood* | $2,500,000R | $930,042.78 | [# 94][# 95] |\n| 1923 | *The Covered Wagon* | $5,000,000R | $800,000 | [# 96][# 97] |\n| 1924 | *The Sea Hawk* | $3,000,000R | $700,000 | [# 96] |\n| 1925 | *The Big Parade* | $18,000,000–22,000,000R  ($6,131,000)R | $382,000 | [# 98][# 99][# 100] |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t* \"Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)\". *Box Office Mojo*.

This additional footage, incorporated two months prior to the film's release, was specifically added for the television advertising campaign to visually differentiate the film from *Deep Impact* which was released a few months before.[13] At a budget of $140 million, it was Buena Vista's most expensive film at the time.[14]\n\n\n\n## Music[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n***Armageddon*** is a 1998 American science fiction disaster film produced and directed by Michael Bay, produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, and released by Touchstone Pictures.

It stars an ensemble cast consisting of Bruce Willis with Billy Bob Thornton, Ben Affleck, Liv Tyler, Will Patton, Steve Buscemi, William Fichtner, Owen Wilson, Michael Clarke Duncan, Keith David and Peter Stormare.\n\n\nThe film was a commercial success, grossing $553 million worldwide against a $140 million budget and becoming the highest-grossing film of 1998, and the highest grossing film to be released by Touchstone Pictures.

On *Siskel and Ebert*, Ebert gave it a Thumbs Down. However, his co-host Gene Siskel gave it a Thumbs Up, commenting on the noise and intensity of the film, but also stating that he found the film to be amusing. Ebert went on to name *Armageddon* as the worst film of 1998 (though he was originally considering *Spice World*).[31] Todd McCarthy of *Variety* also gave the film a negative review, noting Michael Bay's rapid cutting style: \"Much of the confusion, as well as the lack of dramatic rhythm or character development, results directly from Bay's cutting style, which resembles a machine gun stuck in the firing position for 21⁄2 hours.\"[27]\n\n\n\nIn April 2013, in a *Miami Herald* interview to promote *Pain & Gain*, Bay was quoted as having said:\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n1998 science fiction film by Michael Bay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Armageddon |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)Theatrical release poster\n |\n| Directed by | Michael Bay |\n| Screenplay by | * Jonathan Hensleigh\n* J.

It ranked first at the box office with an opening weekend gross of $36 million and $54.2 million from its first five days. \"Armageddon\" grossed $201.6 million in the United States and Canada and $352.1 million in other territories, totaling $553.7 million worldwide. It was the highest-grossing film of 1998 worldwide and the second-highest-grossing film in the United States, just behind \"Saving Private Ryan.\"\n\n**Production:**\nPrincipal photography began on August 27, 1997, and ended on January 29, 1998. The film's budget was $140 million, making it Buena Vista's most expensive film at the time. Additional special effects scenes were added two months before the release to visually differentiate the film from \"Deep Impact,\" which was released a few months earlier.\n\n**Critical Response:**\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics. Roger Ebert listed it among his most hated films, criticizing it as \"an assault on the eyes, the ears, the brain, common sense and the human desire to be entertained.\" However, Gene Siskel gave it a Thumbs Up, finding it amusing despite its noise and intensity. Todd McCarthy of Variety also gave a negative review, noting Michael Bay's rapid cutting style as a source of confusion and lack of dramatic rhythm.\n\n**Awards and Nominations:**\n\"Armageddon\" received several nominations and awards, including a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actor for Bruce Willis. It was also nominated for the Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film.\n\n**Music:**\nThe film's music was composed by Trevor Rabin.\n\n**Notable Facts:**\n- Bruce Willis was cast as part of a three-picture deal with the studio.\n- Sean Connery was originally considered for the role of Harry Stamper.\n- The film was a commercial success despite its mixed critical reception.\n\n**Legacy:**\n\"Armageddon\" remains a notable entry in the disaster film genre and is remembered for its high-octane action sequences and ensemble cast.","name":null,"tool_call_id":null,"tool_calls":[],"is_tool_call_error":null}}
