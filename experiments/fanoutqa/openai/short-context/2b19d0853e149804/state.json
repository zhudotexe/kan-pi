Here are the classic warning signs and symptoms:\n\n1. **Blood in the Stool**: This can be visible or detected through tests.\n2. **Change in Bowel Movements**: This includes worsening constipation, diarrhea, or a change in stool caliber (thickness).\n3. **Unintentional Weight Loss**: Losing weight without trying.\n4. **Loss of Appetite**: A decreased desire to eat.\n5. **Nausea or Vomiting**: Feeling sick to the stomach or vomiting.\n6. **Fatigue**: Feeling unusually tired or weak.\n7. **Rectal Bleeding**: Visible blood in the stool or on toilet paper.\n8. **Anemia**: Low red blood cell count, which can cause fatigue and weakness.\n\n### High-Risk Symptoms in People Over 50\n\n- **Rectal Bleeding or Anemia**: These are considered high-risk symptoms, especially in individuals over the age of 50.\n- **Weight Loss and Changes in Bowel Habits**: These are typically concerning if they are associated with rectal bleeding.\n\n### Additional Information\n\n- **Asymptomatic Cases**: Around 50% of people with colorectal cancer do not report any symptoms.\n- **Screening**: Screening is effective for preventing and decreasing deaths from colorectal cancer. It is recommended starting from the age of 45 to 75.\n\n### Global Impact\n\n- Colorectal cancer is the third most common type of cancer globally, making up about 10% of all cases.\n- In 2018, there were 1.09 million new cases and 551,000 deaths from the disease.\n- It is more common in developed countries, where more than 65% of cases are found.\n- It is less common in women than men.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the [Wikipedia article on Colorectal Cancer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer).",

The symptoms can vary depending on the stage of the cancer:\n\n#### Early Symptoms:\n- Heartburn\n- Upper abdominal pain\n- Nausea\n- Loss of appetite\n- Bloating\n- Belching\n\n#### Later Symptoms:\n- Weight loss\n- Yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice)\n- Vomiting blood\n- Difficulty swallowing\n- Blood in the stool (which may appear dark and tarry)\n- Unexplained weight loss\n- Anemia\n- Fatigue\n- Abdominal discomfort\n\n### Stomach Cancer and Mortality in Females\n\nStomach cancer is a significant cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. In 2018, it was the fifth most frequently diagnosed cancer and the third leading cause of cancer deaths globally. Among women, stomach cancer accounted for 4.1% of all cancer cases. The mortality rate is high due to the often late diagnosis, as early symptoms can be nonspecific or absent.\n\n### Key Points:\n- Stomach cancer is more common in males than females.\n- It is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths, particularly in East Asia and Eastern Europe.\n- Early detection is challenging, contributing to its poor prognosis.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the [Wikipedia article on Stomach Cancer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer).",

Breast cancer comprises 22.9% of invasive cancers in women[202] and 16% of all female cancers.[203] In 2012, it comprised 25.2% of cancers diagnosed in women, making it the most-common female cancer.[204]\n\n\nIn 2008, breast cancer caused 458,503 deaths worldwide (13.7% of cancer deaths in women and 6.0% of all cancer deaths for men and women together).[202] Lung cancer, the second most-common cause of cancer-related deaths in women, caused 12.8% of cancer deaths in women (18.2% of all cancer deaths for men and women together).[202]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 2002 it was noted that as a result of breast cancer's high visibility, the statistical results can be misinterpreted, such as the claim that one in eight women will be diagnosed with breast cancer during their lives \u2013 a claim that depends on the unrealistic assumption that no woman will die of any other disease before the age of 95.[220]:\u200a199\u2013200 By 2010 the breast cancer survival rate in Europe was 91% at one years and 65% at five years. In the USA the five-year survival rate for localized breast cancer was 96.8%, while in cases of metastases it was only 20.6%. Because the prognosis for breast cancer was at this stage relatively favorable, compared to the prognosis for other cancers, breast cancer as cause of death among women was 13.9% of all cancer deaths. The second most common cause of death from cancer in women was lung cancer, the most common cancer worldwide for men and women. The improved survival rate made breast cancer the most prevalent cancer in the world. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n6. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Sung H, Ferlay J, Siegel RL, Laversanne M, Soerjomataram I, Jemal A, Bray F (May 2021). \"Global Cancer Statistics 2020: GLOBOCAN Estimates of Incidence and Mortality Worldwide for 36 Cancers in 185 Countries\". *CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians*. **71** (3): 209\u2013249. doi:10.3322/caac.21660.

In the twelve world regions, the annual age-standardized incidence rates per 100,000 women are as follows: 18 in Eastern Asia, 22 in South Central Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, 26 in South-Eastern Asia, 26, 28 in North Africa and Western Asia, 42 in South and Central America, 42, 49 in Eastern Europe, 56 in Southern Europe, 73 in Northern Europe, 74 in Oceania, 78 in Western Europe, and 90 in North America.[205] Metastatic breast cancer affects between 19% (United States) and 50% (parts of Africa) of women with breast cancer.[206]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 2010 an estimated 3.6 million women worldwide have had a breast cancer diagnosis in the past five years, while only 1.4 million male or female survivors from lung cancer were alive.[243]\n\n\n\n## Health disparities in breast cancer[edit]\n\n\nThere are ethnic disparities in the mortality rates for breast cancer as well as in breast cancer treatment. Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer affecting women of every ethnic group in the United States. Breast cancer incidence among black women aged 45 and older is higher than that of white women in the same age group. White women aged 60\u201384 have higher incidence rates of breast cancer than Black women. Despite this, Black women at every age are more likely to succumb to breast cancer.[244]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMalignant tumours can result in metastatic tumours \u2013 secondary tumours (originating from the primary tumour) that spread beyond the site of origination. The symptoms caused by metastatic breast cancer will depend on the location of metastasis. Common sites of metastasis include bone, liver, lung, and brain.[35] When cancer has reached such an invasive state, it is categorized as a stage 4 cancer, cancers of this state are often fatal.[36] Common symptoms of stage 4 cancer include unexplained weight loss, bone and joint pain, jaundice and neurological symptoms. These symptoms are called non-specific symptoms because they could be manifestations of many other illnesses.[37] Rarely breast cancer can spread to exceedingly uncommon sites such as peripancreatic lymph nodes causing biliary obstruction leading to diagnostic difficulties.[38]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe number of cases worldwide has significantly increased since the 1970s, a phenomenon partly attributed to the modern lifestyles.[207][208] Breast cancer is strongly related to age with only 5% of all breast cancers occurring in women under 40 years old.[209] There were more than 41,000 newly diagnosed cases of breast cancer registered in England in 2011, around 80% of these cases were in women age 50 or older.[210] Based on U.S. statistics in 2015 there were 2.8 million women affected by breast cancer.[199] In the United States, the age-adjusted incidence of breast cancer per 100,000 women rose from around 102 cases per year in the 1970s to around 141 in the late-1990s, and has since fallen, holding steady around 125 since 2003. However, age-adjusted deaths from breast cancer per 100,000 women only rose slightly from 31.4 in 1975 to 33.2 in 1989 and have since declined steadily to 20.5 in 2014.[211]\n\n\n\n## Multiple primary tumours[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n37. **^** National Cancer Institute (1 September 2004). \"Metastatic Cancer: Questions and Answers\".

Prior to the advent of cigarette smoking in the 20th century, lung cancer was a rare disease. In the 1950s and 1960s, increasing evidence linked lung cancer and tobacco use, culminating in declarations by most large national health bodies discouraging tobacco use.\n\n\n\n\n## Signs and symptoms[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWorldwide, lung cancer is the most diagnosed type of cancer, and the leading cause of cancer death.[94][95] In 2020, 2.2\u00a0million new cases were diagnosed, and 1.8\u00a0million people died from lung cancer, representing 18% of all cancer deaths.[3] Lung cancer deaths are expected to rise globally to nearly 3 million annual deaths by 2035, due to high rates of tobacco use and aging populations.[95] Lung cancer is rare in those younger than 40; after that, cancer rates increase with age, stabilizing around age 80.[1] The median age of a person diagnosed with lung cancer is 70; the median age of death is 72.[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLung cancer incidence varies by geography and sex, with the highest rates in Micronesia, Polynesia, Europe, Asia, and North America; and lowest rates in Africa and Central America.[96] Globally, around 8% of men and 6% of women develop lung cancer in their lifetimes.[1] The ratio of lung cancer cases in men to women varies considerably by geography, from as high as nearly 12:1 in Belarus, to 1:1 in Brazil, likely due to differences in smoking patterns.[97]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAround 19% of people diagnosed with lung cancer survive five years from diagnosis, though prognosis varies based on the stage of the disease at diagnosis and the type of lung cancer.[4] Prognosis is better for people with lung cancer diagnosed at an earlier stage; those diagnosed at the earliest TNM stage, IA1 (small tumor, no spread), have a two-year survival of 97% and five-year survival of 92%.[57] Those diagnosed at the most-advanced stage, IVB, have a two-year survival of 10% and a five-year survival of 0%.[57] Five-year survival is higher in women (22%) than men (16%).[4] Women tend to be diagnosed with less-advanced disease, and have better outcomes than men diagnosed at the same stage.[58] Average five-year survival also varies across the world, with particularly high five-year survival in Japan (33%), and five-year survival above 20% in 12 other countries: Mauritius, Canada, the US, China, South Korea, Taiwan, Israel, Latvia, Iceland, Sweden, Austria, and Switzerland.[59]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Lung cancer |\n| --- |\n| Other names | Lung carcinoma |\n| ![X-ray with an arrow pointing to a hazy circular mass in the chest](image) |\n| A chest X-ray showing a tumor in the lung (marked by arrow) |\n| Specialty | Oncology, pulmonology |\n| Symptoms | Coughing (including coughing up blood), shortness of breath, chest pain |\n| Usual onset | After age 40;[1] 70 years on average[2] |\n| Types | Small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC), non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) |\n| Risk factors | * Tobacco smoking\n* Asbestos\n* Radon\n* Other environmental mutagens\n |\n| Diagnostic method | Medical imaging, tissue biopsy |\n| Prevention | Avoid smoking and other environmental mutagens |\n| Treatment | Surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, molecular therapies, immune checkpoint inhibitors |\n| Prognosis | Five-year survival rate: 10 to 20% (most countries)[3] |\n| Frequency | 2.2\u00a0million (2020)[3] |\n| Deaths | 1.8\u00a0million (2020)[3] |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nEarly lung cancer often has no symptoms. When symptoms do arise they are often nonspecific respiratory problems \u2013 coughing, shortness of breath, or chest pain \u2013 that can differ from person to person.[5] Those who experience coughing tend to report either a new cough, or an increase in the frequency or strength of a pre-existing cough.[5] Around one in four cough up blood, ranging from small streaks in the sputum to large amounts.[6][5] Around half of those diagnosed with lung cancer experience shortness of breath, while 25\u201350% experience a dull, persistent chest pain that remains in the same location over time.[5] In addition to respiratory symptoms, some experience systemic symptoms including loss of appetite, weight loss, general weakness, fever, and night sweats.[5][7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTreatment for early stage lung cancer includes surgery to remove the tumor, sometimes followed by radiation therapy and chemotherapy to kill any remaining cancer cells. Later stage cancer is treated with radiation therapy and chemotherapy alongside drug treatments that target specific cancer subtypes. Even with treatment, only around 20% of people survive five years on from their diagnosis.[4] Survival rates are higher in those diagnosed at an earlier stage, diagnosed at a younger age, and in women compared to men.\n\n\nMost lung cancer cases are caused by tobacco smoking. The remainder are caused by exposure to hazardous substances like asbestos and radon gas, or by genetic mutations that arise by chance. Consequently, lung cancer prevention efforts encourage people to avoid hazardous chemicals and quit smoking. Quitting smoking both reduces one's chance of developing lung cancer and improves treatment outcomes in those already diagnosed with lung cancer.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAbout one in three people diagnosed with lung cancer have symptoms caused by metastases in sites other than the lungs.[7] Lung cancer can metastasize anywhere in the body, with different symptoms depending on the location. Brain metastases can cause headache, nausea, vomiting, seizures, and neurological deficits. Bone metastases can cause pain, bone fractures, and compression of the spinal cord. Metastasis into the bone marrow can deplete blood cells and cause leukoerythroblastosis (immature cells in the blood).[7] Liver metastases can cause liver enlargement, pain in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen, fever, and weight loss.[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Alexander M, Kim SY, Cheng H (December 2020). \"Update 2020: Management of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer\". *Lung*. **198** (6): 897\u2013907. doi:10.1007/s00408-020-00407-5.

As the cancer progresses, most people experience nonspecific respiratory problems: coughing, shortness of breath, or chest pain. Other symptoms depend on the location and size of the tumor. Those suspected of having lung cancer typically undergo a series of imaging tests to determine the location and extent of any tumors. Definitive diagnosis of lung cancer requires a biopsy of the suspected tumor be examined by a pathologist under a microscope. In addition to recognizing cancerous cells, a pathologist can classify the tumor according to the type of cells it originates from. Around 15% of cases are small-cell lung cancer, and the remaining 85% (the non-small-cell lung cancers) are adenocarcinomas, squamous-cell carcinomas, and large-cell carcinomas. After diagnosis, further imaging and biopsies are done to determine the cancer's stage based on how far it has spread.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAlong with diet, body weight and exercise habits are also associated with lung cancer risk. Being overweight is associated with a lower risk of developing lung cancer, possibly due to the tendency of those who smoke cigarettes to have a lower body weight.[92] However, being underweight is also associated with a reduced lung cancer risk.[92] Some studies have shown those who exercise regularly or have better cardiovascular fitness to have a lower risk of developing lung cancer.[92]\n\n\n\n## Epidemiology[edit]\n\n\n![World map with countries in one of five colors](image)Age-standardized lung cancer incidence in 2020 per 100,000 people:[93] >40\n30\u201340\n20\u201330\n10\u201320\n<10\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSeveral other personal and disease factors are associated with improved outcomes. Those diagnosed at a younger age tend to have better outcomes. Those who smoke or experience weight loss as a symptom tend to have worse outcomes. Tumor mutations in KRAS are associated with reduced survival.[58]\n\n\n\n### Experience[edit]\n\n\nThe uncertainty of lung cancer prognosis often causes stress, and makes future planning difficult, for those with lung cancer and their families.[60] Those whose cancer goes into remission often experience fear of their cancer returning or progressing, associated with poor quality of life, negative mood, and functional impairment. This fear is exacerbated by frequent or prolonged surveillance imaging, and other reminders of cancer risks.[60]\n\n\n\n## Causes[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Thai AA, Solomon BJ, Sequist LV, Gainor JF, Heist RS (August 2021). \"Lung cancer\". *Lancet*. **398** (10299): 535\u2013554. doi:10.1016/S0140-6736(21)00312-3.

About one in four people may cough up blood, ranging from small streaks in the sputum to large amounts.\n   - **Shortness of Breath:** Around half of those diagnosed with lung cancer experience this symptom.\n   - **Chest Pain:** 25-50% of patients experience a dull, persistent chest pain that remains in the same location over time.\n\n2. **Systemic Symptoms:**\n   - **Loss of Appetite**\n   - **Weight Loss**\n   - **General Weakness**\n   - **Fever**\n   - **Night Sweats**\n\n3. **Symptoms from Metastases:**\n   - **Brain Metastases:** Headache, nausea, vomiting, seizures, and neurological deficits.\n   - **Bone Metastases:** Pain, bone fractures, and compression of the spinal cord.\n   - **Bone Marrow Metastases:** Depletion of blood cells and leukoerythroblastosis (immature cells in the blood).\n   - **Liver Metastases:** Liver enlargement, pain in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen, fever, and weight loss.\n\n### Top Mortality Cancers in Females\n\nWhile the search did not yield a specific article on the top mortality cancers in females, lung cancer is known to be one of the leading causes of cancer death worldwide, including among women. Other top mortality cancers in females typically include breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and cervical cancer.",

The classic warning signs include: worsening constipation, blood in the stool, decrease in stool caliber (thickness), loss of appetite, loss of weight, and nausea or vomiting in someone over 50 years old.[15] Around 50% of people who have colorectal cancer do not report any symptoms.[16]\n\n\nRectal bleeding or anemia are high-risk symptoms in people over the age of 50.[17] Weight loss and changes in a person's bowel habit are typically only concerning if they are associated with rectal bleeding.[17][18]\n\n\n\n## Cause[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTreatments used for colorectal cancer may include some combination of surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy.[5] Cancers that are confined within the wall of the colon may be curable with surgery, while cancer that has spread widely is usually not curable, with management being directed towards improving quality of life and symptoms.[5] The five-year survival rate in the United States was around 65% in 2014.[6] The individual likelihood of survival depends on how advanced the cancer is, whether or not all the cancer can be removed with surgery, and the person's overall health.[1] Globally, colorectal cancer is the third most common type of cancer, making up about 10% of all cases.[14] In 2018, there were 1.09 million new cases and 551,000 deaths from the disease.[8] It is more common in developed countries, where more than 65% of cases are found.[2] It is less common in women than men.[2]\n\n\n\n\n## Signs and symptoms[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n**Colorectal cancer** (**CRC**), also known as **bowel cancer**, **colon cancer**, or **rectal cancer**, is the development of cancer from the colon or rectum (parts of the large intestine).[5] Signs and symptoms may include blood in the stool, a change in bowel movements, weight loss, and fatigue.[9] Most colorectal cancers are due to old age and lifestyle factors, with only a small number of cases due to underlying genetic disorders.[2][3] Risk factors include diet, obesity, smoking, and lack of physical activity.[2] Dietary factors that increase the risk include red meat, processed meat, and alcohol.[2][4] Another risk factor is inflammatory bowel disease, which includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.[2] Some of the inherited genetic disorders that can cause colorectal cancer include familial adenomatous polyposis and hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer; however, these represent less than 5% of cases.[2][3] It typically starts as a benign tumor, often in the form of a polyp, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIt predicted that, in 2023, an estimated 19,550 diagnoses and 3,750 deaths would be in people younger than 50.[190] Colorectal cancer also disproportionately affects the Black community, where the rates are the highest of any racial/ethnic group in the US. African Americans are about 20% more likely to get colorectal cancer and about 40% more likely to die from it than most other groups. Black Americans often experience greater obstacles to cancer prevention, detection, treatment, and survival, including systemic racial disparities that are complex and go beyond the obvious connection to cancer.\n\n\n\n### United Kingdom[edit]\n\n\nIn the UK about 41,000 people a year get colon cancer making it the fourth most common type.[191]\n\n\n\n### Australia[edit]\n\n\nOne in 19 men and one in 28 women in Australia will develop colorectal cancer before the age of 75; one in 10 men and one in 15 women will develop it by 85 years of age.[192]\n\n\n\n### Papua New Guinea[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the developing countries like Papua New Guinea and other Pacific Island States including the Solomon Islands, colorectal cancer is a very rare cancer amongst the people, which is least common compared to lung, stomach, liver or breast cancer. It is estimated that at least 8 in 100,000 of the people are most likely to developed colorectal cancer every year, which is unlike lung or breast cancer, where for the latter alone is 24 in 100,000 of the women folks alone.[193]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nRectal cancer has been diagnosed in an Ancient Egyptian mummy who had lived in the Dakhleh Oasis during the Ptolemaic period.[194]\n\n\n\n## Society and culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of people diagnosed with colorectal cancer\n\nIn the United States, March is colorectal cancer awareness month.[118]\n\n\n\n## Research[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nwhich over time becomes cancerous.[2]\n\n\nColorectal cancer may be diagnosed by obtaining a sample of the colon during a sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy.[1] This is then followed by medical imaging to determine whether the disease has spread.[5] Screening is effective for preventing and decreasing deaths from colorectal cancer.[10] Screening, by one of a number of methods, is recommended starting from the age of 45 to 75. It was recommended starting at age 50 but it was changed to 45 due to increasing amount of colon cancers.[10][11] During colonoscopy, small polyps may be removed if found.[2] If a large polyp or tumor is found, a biopsy may be performed to check if it is cancerous. Aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs decrease the risk of pain during polyp excision.[2][12] Their general use is not recommended for this purpose, however, due to side effects.[13]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs more than 80% of colorectal cancers arise from adenomatous polyps, screening for this cancer is effective for both early detection and for prevention.[20][117] Diagnosis of cases of colorectal cancer through screening tends to occur 2\u20133 years before diagnosis of cases with symptoms.[20] Any polyps that are detected can be removed, usually by colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy, and thus prevent them from turning into cancer. Screening has the potential to reduce colorectal cancer deaths by 60%.[118]\n\n\nThe three main screening tests are colonoscopy, fecal occult blood testing, and flexible sigmoidoscopy. Of the three, only sigmoidoscopy cannot screen the right side of the colon where 42% of cancers are found.[119] Flexible sigmoidoscopy, however, has the best evidence for decreasing the risk of death from any cause.[120]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n8. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Bray F, Ferlay J, Soerjomataram I, Siegel RL, Torre LA, Jemal A (November 2018). \"Global cancer statistics 2018: GLOBOCAN estimates of incidence and mortality worldwide for 36 cancers in 185 countries\". *CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians*. **68** (6): 394\u2013424. doi:10.3322/caac.21492.

By the time symptoms are recognized, the cancer has often reached an advanced stage (see below) and may have metastasized (spread to other, perhaps distant, parts of the body), which is one of the main reasons for its relatively poor prognosis.[22] Stomach cancer can cause the following signs and symptoms: Unexplained nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and constipation. Patients also can experience unexplained weight loss.[23]\n\n\nEarly cancers may be associated with indigestion or a burning sensation (heartburn). However, fewer than one in every 50 people referred for endoscopy due to indigestion has cancer.[24] Abdominal discomfort and loss of appetite, especially for meat, can occur.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe stomach is a muscular organ of the gastrointestinal tract that holds food and begins the digestive process by secreting gastric juice. The most common cancers of the stomach are adenocarcinomas, but other histological types have been reported. Signs vary, but may include vomiting (especially if blood is present), weight loss, anemia, and lack of appetite. Bowel movements may be dark and tarry in nature. To determine whether cancer is present in the stomach, special X-rays and/or abdominal ultrasounds may be performed. Gastroscopy, a test using an endoscope to examine the stomach, is a useful diagnostic tool that can also take samples of the suspected mass for histopathological analysis to confirm or rule out cancer. The most definitive method of cancer diagnosis is through open surgical biopsy.[110] Most stomach tumors are malignant with evidence of spread to lymph nodes or liver, making treatment difficult. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe most common cause is infection by the bacterium *Helicobacter pylori*, which accounts for more than 60% of cases.[2][3][13] Certain types of *H. pylori* have greater risks than others.[2] Smoking, dietary factors such as pickled vegetables and obesity are other risk factors.[2][4] About 10% of cases run in families, and between 1% and 3% of cases are due to genetic syndromes inherited such as hereditary diffuse gastric cancer.[2] Most of the time, stomach cancer develops in stages over years.[2] Diagnosis is usually by biopsy done during endoscopy.[1] This is followed by medical imaging to determine if the disease has spread to other parts of the body.[1] Japan and South Korea, two countries that have high rates of the disease, screen for stomach cancer.[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMALT lymphomas are often completely resolved after the underlying *H. pylori* infection is treated.[16] This results in remission in about 80% of cases.[16]\n\n\n\n## Prognosis[edit]\n\n\nThe prognosis of stomach cancer is generally poor, because the tumor has often metastasized by the time of discovery, and most people with the condition are elderly (median age is between 70 and 75 years) at presentation.[93] The average life expectancy after being diagnosed is around 24 months, and the five-year survival rate for stomach cancer is less than 10%.[6]\n\n\nAlmost 300 genes are related to outcomes in stomach cancer, with both unfavorable genes where high expression is related to poor survival and favorable genes where high expression is associated with longer survival times.[94][95] Examples of poor prognosis genes include ITGAV, DUSP1 and P2RX7.[96]\n\n\n\n## Epidemiology[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Stomach cancer deaths per million persons in 2012 0\u201311\n12\u201316\n17\u201324\n25\u201333\n34\u201351\n52\u201376\n77\u2013102\n103\u2013128\n129\u2013175\n176\u2013400\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n21. **^** Moore RJ, Spiegel D, eds.

Unfortunately, because early stomach cancer causes few symptoms, the disease is usually advanced when the diagnosis is made.[84]\n\n\nTreatment for stomach cancer may include surgery,[85] chemotherapy,[14] or radiation therapy.[86] New treatment approaches such as immunotherapy or gene therapy and improved ways of using current methods are being studied in clinical trials.[87]\n\n\n\n### Surgery[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGastric cancers that have enlarged and invaded normal tissue can cause weakness, fatigue, bloating of the stomach after meals, abdominal pain in the upper abdomen, nausea and occasional vomiting. Further enlargement may cause weight loss or bleeding with vomiting blood or having blood in the stool, the latter apparent as black discolouration (melena) and sometimes leading to anemia. Dysphagia suggests a tumour in the cardia or extension of the gastric tumour into the esophagus.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThese can be symptoms of other problems such as a stomach virus, gastric ulcer, or tropical sprue.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Risk factors[edit]\n\n\nGastric cancer can occur as a result of many factors.[25] It occurs twice as commonly in males as females. Estrogen may protect women against the development of this form of cancer.[26][27]\n\n\n\n### Infections[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Stomach cancer types by relative incidence[66]\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

In 2018, it was the fifth most frequently diagnosed cancer and the third leading cause of cancer deaths globally. Among women, stomach cancer accounted for 4.1% of all cancer cases. The mortality rate is high due to the often late diagnosis, as early symptoms can be nonspecific or absent.\n\n### Key Points:\n- Stomach cancer is more common in males than females.\n- It is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths, particularly in East Asia and Eastern Europe.\n- Early detection is challenging, contributing to its poor prognosis.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the [Wikipedia article on Stomach Cancer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer).",
