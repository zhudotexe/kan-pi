The College of Philadelphia, which became Penn, College of New Jersey, which became Princeton University, and King's College, which later became Columbia College and ultimately Columbia University, all originated within a few years of each other. After initially designating 1750 as its founding date, Penn later considered 1749 to be its founding date for more than a century with Penn alumni observing a centennial celebration in 1849. In 1895, several elite universities in the United States convened in New York City as the Intercollegiate Commission at the invitation of John J. McCook, a Union Army officer during the American Civil War and member of Princeton's board of trustees who chaired its Committee on Academic Dress. The primary purpose of the conference was to standardize American academic regalia, which was accomplished through the adoption of the Intercollegiate Code on Academic Costume. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHowever, Princeton has not asserted this, and a Princeton historian says that \"the facts do not warrant\" such an interpretation.[40] Columbia also implicitly challenges Penn's use of either 1750, 1749 or 1740 as its founding date since it claims to be the fifth-oldest institution of higher learning in the United States after Harvard, William & Mary, Yale, and Princeton based on its charter date of 1754 and Penn's charter date of 1755.[41] Academic histories of American higher education typically list Penn variously as either the nation's fifth or sixth-oldest institution of higher learning in the nation after Princeton and immediately before or after Columbia.[42][43][44]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n36. **^** \"Gazette: Building Penn's Brand (Sept/Oct 2002)\". *www.upenn.edu*.

Penn identifies as the fourth oldest institution of higher education in the United States, though this representation is challenged by other universities, as Franklin first convened the Board of Trustees in 1749, arguably making it the fifth oldest institution of higher education in the U.S.[note 2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * ![](image) **Category**\n* ![](image) **Commons**\n |\n\n| Links to related articles\n |\n| --- |\n| | * v\n* t\n* e\nIvy League\n |\n| --- |\n| Teams | * Brown Bears\n* Columbia Lions\n* Cornell Big Red\n* Dartmouth Big Green\n* Harvard Crimson\n* Penn Quakers\n* Princeton Tigers\n* Yale Bulldogs\n |\n| Competitions | * Baseball\n* Basketball (men's)\n* Basketball (women's)\n* Fencing\n* Rugby\n |\n| Related topics | * Big Three\n* Business schools\n* Digital Network\n* Ivy Council\n* Law schools\n* Medical schools\n* Nude posture photos\n* Public Ivy\n* Public policy schools\n* *Take Ivy*\n* Y Tu Tambien\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThis formalized protocol included a provision that established academic processions and placed visiting dignitaries and other officials in the order of their institution's founding dates.

He advocated what was then an innovative concept of higher education, which taught both the ornamental knowledge of the arts and the practical skills necessary for making a living and performing public service. The proposed program of study could have become the nation's first modern liberal arts curriculum, although it was never implemented because Anglican priest William Smith, who became the first provost, and other trustees strongly preferred the traditional curriculum.[46][47]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_fWCZo8Kuwf4tzqD5ZbyZVHUd","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

He is the Provost of Harvard University.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nGarber was born in 1955.[1] He graduated from Harvard College in 1976 with an AB in economics[1] and stayed at Harvard to earn an AM and a PhD in economics.[1] While pursuing his PhD, he enrolled simultaneously at Stanford University, where he received an MD degree in 1983.[2]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nGarber succeeded Steven Hyman as the provost of Harvard University on September 1, 2011.[2]\n\n\nGarber is also the Mallinckrodt Professor of Health Care Policy at Harvard Medical School, Professor of Economics in the Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Professor of Public Policy in the John F. Kennedy School of Government, and Professor in the Department of Health Policy and Management in the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.[3][4]\n\n\n\n## Graduate student unionization controversy[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2016, Harvard University's Office of the Provost launched a web page in response to its graduate students' efforts to unionize.[5] On August 23, 2016, following the Columbia decision which restored union rights to teaching and research assistants, the Provost's office wrote in an email to students, \"we continue to believe that the relationship between students and the University is primarily about education, and that unionization will disrupt academic programs and freedoms, mentoring, and research at Harvard.\"[5] Following a decision by the Regional Director of the National Labor Relations Board that Harvard was in violation of the Excelsior rule, Garber has defended the university's appeal to the National Labor Relations Board in Washington, D.C.,[6] writing that the university \"believes that the November 2016 election results, which reflect the votes and voices of well-informed students, should stand, and has appealed the Regional Director's decision to the contrary.\"[5]\n\n\nOn December 3, 2019, Harvard's graduate student union began striking[7][8] on Harvard's campus due to the university's opposition to contractual changes.[9] The union's proposed changes include pay increases based on rising living-costs, expanded healthcare coverage for dependents, improved mental health services benefits, as well as third-party oversight of sexual harassment and assault cases.[7][10][11]\n\n\n\n## Pharmaceutical board memberships[edit]\n\n\nIn October 2019, *The Harvard Crimson* reported that Garber collected more than $2.7 million serving on the board of directors for Exelixis[12] and Vertex Pharmaceuticals[13] since being appointed as Harvard's provost in 2011, according to SEC filings.[14] The companies indicated that his compensation was normal for board members. Garber states that he has thoroughly disclosed his industry affiliations in conflict of interest forms for the university.\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nGarber has a wife, Anne Yahanda, and four children.[2]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** \"Alan Michael Garber\".

Its official corporate name is \"The Trustees of Columbia University in the City of New York\". The university's first charter was granted in 1754 by King George II; however, its modern charter was first enacted in 1787 and last amended in 1810 by the New York State Legislature. The university is governed by 24 trustees, customarily including the president, who serves *ex officio*. The trustees themselves are responsible for choosing their successors. Six of the 24 are nominated from a pool of candidates recommended by the Columbia Alumni Association. Another six are nominated by the board in consultation with the executive committee of the University Senate. The remaining 12, including the president, are nominated by the trustees themselves through their internal processes. The term of office for trustees is six years. Generally, they serve for no more than two consecutive terms. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nColumbia University| ![](image)Coat of arms\n |\n| Latin: *Universitas Columbiae* |\n| Former names\n | King's College(1754–1784)Columbia College(1784–1896)[1]: 53–60 |\n| Motto | *In lumine Tuo videbimus lumen* (Latin) |\n| Motto in English\n | \"In Thy light shall we see light\"[2] |\n| Type | Private research university |\n| Established | May 25, 1754; 270 years ago (1754-05-25) |\n| Accreditation | MSCHE |\n| Academic affiliations\n | * AAU\n* NAICU\n* URA\n* Space-grant\n |\n| Endowment | $13.3 billion (2022)[3] |\n| President | Minouche Shafik |\n| Provost | Dennis Mitchell |\n| Academic staff\n | 4,370[4] |\n| Students | 34,782 (Fall 2022)[5] |\n| Undergraduates | 6,668 (Fall 2022)[n 1][5] |\n| Postgraduates | 25,880 (Fall 2022)[5] |\n| Location | New York\n, New York\n, United States\n40°48′27″N 73°57′43″W﻿ / ﻿40.80750°N 73.96194°W﻿ / 40.80750; -73.96194 |\n| Campus | Large city, 299 acres (1.21 km2) |\n| Newspaper | *Columbia Daily Spectator* |\n| Colors | Columbia blue and white[8]    |\n| Nickname | Lions |\n| Sporting affiliations\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Moore, Nathanal Fischer (1846). *A Historical Sketch of Columbia*.

In 1979, these faculties were merged into the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.[92] In 1991, the faculties of Columbia College, the School of General Studies, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, the School of the Arts, and the School of Professional Studies were merged into the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, leading to the academic integration and centralized governance of these schools. In 2010, the School of International and Public Affairs, which was previously a part of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, became an independent faculty.[93]\n\n\n\n## Campus[edit]\n\n\n### Morningside Heights[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n172. **^** Mueller, Julia (June 7, 2023). \"Columbia University no longer submitting data to US News college ranking\". *The Hill*.

Its endowment stands at $13.3 billion as of 2022[update], which is among the largest of any academic institution.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)College Walk\nThe majority of Columbia's graduate and undergraduate studies are conducted in the Upper Manhattan neighborhood of Morningside Heights on Seth Low's late-19th century vision of a university campus where all disciplines could be taught at one location. The campus was designed along Beaux-Arts planning principles by the architects McKim, Mead & White. Columbia's main campus occupies more than six city blocks, or 32 acres (13 ha), in Morningside Heights, New York City, a neighborhood that contains a number of academic institutions. The university owns over 7,800 apartments in Morningside Heights, housing faculty, graduate students, and staff. Almost two dozen undergraduate dormitories (purpose-built or converted) are located on campus or in Morningside Heights. Columbia University has an extensive tunnel system, more than a century old, with the oldest portions predating the present campus. Some of these remain accessible to the public, while others have been cordoned off.[94]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n9. **^** McCaughey, Robert A.

The first was a formal change in name, giving the institution the fourth in its history. It began in 1754 as King's College and became in 1784 and remained for three thereafter Columbia College in the State of New York. From 1787 until 1896 Columbia was officially Columbia College in the City of New York, until, by trustee resolution on May 2, 1896, it became Columbia University in the City of New York.<Footnote 2: Columbia University Trustees Minutes, January 8, 1912. The change was formally accepted by the New York State Board of Regents in 1912. (page 609)>\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n83. **^** \"University Senate\". *Senate.columbia.edu*.

Strobel** (born July 4, 1964)[*citation needed*] is the provost of Yale University as well as a professor of molecular biophysics and biochemistry. He was the vice provost for Science Initiatives and vice president for West Campus Planning & Program Development. An educator and researcher, he has led a number of Yale initiatives over the past two decades. Strobel was appointed as Yale's provost in 2020.[1]\n\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nStrobel earned a bachelor's degree in biochemistry from Brigham Young University and a Ph.D. in biology from the California Institute of Technology, under the guidance of Peter Dervan, before doing postdoctoral research at the University of Colorado, Boulder, under the mentorship of Thomas Cech. He has been a professor with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) since 2006.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nHe joined the Yale faculty in 1995 in the Department of Molecular Biophysics & Biochemistry and served as department chair from 2006 to 2009. Since 2011 he has served as vice president for West Campus Planning & Program Development, where he has directed the expansion of the West Campus as a research and educational center. In 2014 he also became the inaugural deputy provost for Teaching & Learning. In this capacity he has overseen the creation of the Yale Poorvu Center for Teaching and Learning, housed within the Sterling Memorial Library. The center provides teaching resources and support to Yale faculty, postdocs, graduate students and undergraduate students.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Research and Teaching[edit]\n\n\nStrobel's research focuses on the biophysics and biochemistry of catalytic RNAs, including riboswitches and peptidyl transferase. His group developed the early methods of Nucleotide Analog Interference Mapping, used to determine the importance of particular functional groups in a structured RNA molecule.[2] Strobel's group solved the x-ray crystal structure of the full length *Azoarcus* Group I catalytic intron,[3][4] the glmS ribozyme,[5] and the c-di-GMP riboswitch.[6] He has also collaborated with the Thomas A. Steitz lab at Yale on structural studies toward better understanding the mechanism of ribosomal peptide synthesis.[7]\n\n\nHe was twice named a HHMI professor to promote undergraduate science education. With this award he instituted an undergraduate research course, the Rainforest Expedition and Laboratory, which explored microbial and chemical diversity in the world's rainforests as a means to inspire undergraduate students in the sciences. He has led groups of undergraduate students into the rainforest over spring break to hunt for novel endophytes that live inside plants. Following fieldwork, students then isolated microbes and tested them for interesting properties, discovering a variety of organisms including novel fungi with new biological and chemical properties, including *Pestalotiopsis microspora*, of which some strains degrade polyurethane.[8][9]\n\n\n\n## Awards and honors[edit]\n\n\nStrobel has received Beckman, Searle and Basil O'Connor career awards.[*citation needed*] He received the Dylan Hixon Prize for Teaching Excellence in the Natural Sciences. He also received the Yale Graduate Mentoring Award in the Sciences. He received the Yale Science and Engineering Association Award for Meritorious Service to Yale University.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Personal[edit]\n\n\nStrobel and his son run a small hobby business crafting remnants of campus trees into various lathed items.[10]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Peart, Karen (6 November 2019). \"Scott Strobel named Yale provost\". *YaleNews*.\n2. **^** Strobel SA; Shetty K.
