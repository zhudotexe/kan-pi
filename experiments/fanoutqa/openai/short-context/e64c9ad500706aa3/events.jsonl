Foreign presses operating in 20 countries contributed to the publication of 20 translations in 35 versions.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Publication number[edit]\n\n\nThe *Little Red Book* has produced a wide array of sales and distribution figures. Some sources claim that over 6.5 billion printed volumes have been distributed in total,[2] others contend that the distribution ran into the \"billions\",[3] and others cite \"over a billion\" official volumes between 1966 and 1969 alone as well as \"untold numbers of unofficial local reprints and unofficial translations.\"[4][5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThis disrupted plans for publishing any new volumes of *The Complete Works of Marx and Engels* that was already in progress. It also halted distribution of other ideological works. As late as 1970, more than 8 million copies of the 4-volume set of *Selected Works of Marx and Engels* that had already been printed (both in cloth hardcover and paperback) remained undistributed in storage warehouses on the grounds that other works \"should not interfere with learning *Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-Tung*\".[*citation needed*]\n\n\nOn the other hand, several other works by Mao had very large printings during the same period, even though these editions were not produced in the large numbers of *Quotations from Chairman Mao*. These include *Selected Works of Mao Zedong* (in four volumes, 2.875 million copies in 14 languages), *Selected Articles of Mao Zedong* (various editions totalling 252 million copies), single article books, and works of poetry.[1]\n\n\n\n## Foreign distribution[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAt the end of 1965, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party officially approved the book for publication by the People's Publishing House and for distribution within China by the Xinhua Bookstore.\n\n\nThe Ministry of Culture held special study meetings to develop a production and distribution plan. It sought assurances that the book would receive publishing priority and that there would be sufficient paper, ink, and printing presses available. The goal was for \"ninety-nine percent (of the population of China to) read Chairman Mao's book\", according to a catalogue of publication records of the People's Publishing House.[*citation needed*] Provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across China were ordered to build hundreds of new printing houses to publish the *Quotations* during the second half of 1966, which pushed the limits of the Chinese printing industry.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Cover of the first edition English version of the Little Red Book circa 1966.\n![](image)Chairman Mao from 1966 French edition, Beijing.\nIn 1966, the Publicity Department of the Chinese Communist Party approved *Quotations from Chairman Mao* for export. To meet overseas requirements, the editors of the Chinese Foreign Languages Press made revisions necessitated by the situation. They added a \"second edition preface\" endorsement by Lin Biao, dated 16 December 1966 (which was torn out following Lin Biao's death and public disgrace in September 1971). On the last page, they listed the names of the publisher (PLA General Political Department) without an ISBN, the printer and distributor (both Xinhua Bookstore), and the publication year.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"How Much Did Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping, and Jiang Zemin Get Paid for Their Publications?\".

In 1607, an edition was printed in Brussels. Robles, the Madrid publisher, found it necessary to meet demand with a third edition, a seventh publication in all, in 1608. Popularity of the book in Italy was such that a Milan bookseller issued an Italian edition in 1610. Yet another Brussels edition was called for in 1611.[49] Since then, numerous editions have been released and in total, the novel is believed to have sold more than 500 million copies worldwide.[52] The work has been produced in numerous editions and languages, the Cervantes Collection, at the State Library of New South Wales includes over 1,100 editions. These were collected, by Ben Haneman, over a period of thirty years.[53]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Illustration to *Don Quixote de la Mancha* by Miguel de Cervantes (the edition translated by Charles Jarvis)\n![](image)Don Quixote.

Most of the 400 copies of the first edition were sent to the New World, with the publisher hoping to get a better price in the Americas.[50] Although most of them disappeared in a shipwreck near La Havana, approximately 70 copies reached Lima, from where they were sent to Cuzco, in the heart of the defunct Inca Empire.[50]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe most widely read English-language translations of the mid-20th century are by Samuel Putnam (1949), J. M. Cohen (1950; Penguin Classics), and Walter Starkie (1957). The last English translation of the novel in the 20th century was by Burton Raffel, published in 1996. The 21st century has already seen five new translations of the novel into English. The first is by John D. Rutherford and the second by Edith Grossman. Reviewing the novel in *The New York Times*, Carlos Fuentes called Grossman's translation a \"major literary achievement\"[63] and another called it the \"most transparent and least impeded among more than a dozen English translations going back to the 17th century.\"[64]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** *Oxford English Dictionary*. \"Don Quixote\".\n2. **^** Bloom, Harold (13 December 2003). \"The knight in the mirror\". *The Guardian*.
