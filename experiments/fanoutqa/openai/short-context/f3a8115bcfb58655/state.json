During the Meiji Restoration in 1868, the name of the city was changed to Tokyo (\u6771\u4eac, from \u6771 *t\u014d* \"east\", and \u4eac *ky\u014d* \"capital\"), when it became the new imperial capital,[18] in line with the East Asian tradition of including the word capital (\u4eac) in the name of the capital city (for example, Kyoto (\u4eac\u90fd), Keij\u014d (\u4eac\u57ce), Beijing (\u5317\u4eac), Nanjing (\u5357\u4eac), and Xijing (\u897f\u4eac)).[17] During the early Meiji period, the city was sometimes called \"T\u014dkei\", an alternative pronunciation for the same characters representing \"Tokyo\", making it a kanji homograph. Some surviving official English documents use the spelling \"Tokei\";[19] however, this pronunciation is now obsolete.[20]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Tokyo\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Tokyo** (/\u02c8to\u028akio\u028a/;[7] Japanese: \u6771\u4eac, *T\u014dky\u014d*, [to\u02d0k\u02b2o\u02d0] \u24d8), officially the **Tokyo Metropolis** (\u6771\u4eac\u90fd, *T\u014dky\u014d-to*), is the capital of Japan and the most populous city in the world with a population of over 14 million residents as of 2023.[8]\n\n\nThe Tokyo metropolitan area, which includes Tokyo and three neighboring Japanese prefectures, Tochigi, Gunma, and Ibaraki, is 13,452 square kilometers or 5,194 square miles and the world's most-populous metropolitan area with 40.8 million residents as of 2023[update].[9]\n\n\nLocated at the head of Tokyo Bay, Tokyo is part of the Kant\u014d region on the central coast of Honshu, Japan's largest island.

The average elevation in Tokyo is 40\u00a0m (131\u00a0ft).[49] Chiba Prefecture borders it to the east, Yamanashi to the west, Kanagawa to the south, and Saitama to the north. Mainland Tokyo is further subdivided into the special wards (occupying the eastern half) and the Tama area (\u591a\u6469\u5730\u57df) stretching westwards. Tokyo has a latitude of 35.65 (near the 36th parallel north), which makes it more southern than Rome (41.90), Madrid (40.41), New York City (40.71) and Beijing (39.91).[50]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n14. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Metropolitan Area Outer Underground Discharge Channel\".

New Delhi is jointly administered by the federal government of India and the local government of Delhi, and serves as the capital of the nation as well as the NCT of Delhi. Delhi is also the centre of the National Capital Region, which is an \"interstate regional planning\" area created in 1985.[20][21] Delhi hosted the inaugural 1951 Asian Games, the 1982 Asian Games, the 1983 Non-Aligned Movement summit, the 2010 Men's Hockey World Cup, the 2010 Commonwealth Games, and the 2012 BRICS summit and was one of the major host cities of the 2011 Cricket World Cup and 2023 Cricket World Cup\n\n\n\n\n## Toponym[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Rapid Transit | Delhi Metro |\n| Literacy (2011) | 86.21%[11] |\n| Sex ratio (2011) | 868 \u2640/1000 \u2642[11] |\n| Website | delhi.gov.in |\n\n\n**Delhi**,[a] officially the **National Capital Territory** (**NCT**) **of Delhi**, is a city and a union territory of India containing New Delhi, the capital of India.

Almost the entire street is occupied by fast food stalls or street vendors. It has nearly become a tradition that almost every prime minister of India has visited the street to eat *paratha* at least once.

Following a 45-year dormancy after the founding of the PRC in 1949, the club was re-established in 1994 by expatriates living in the city and has since grown to over 300 members. The Shanghai cricket team played various international matches between 1866 and 1948. With cricket in the rest of China almost non-existent, for that period they were the de facto China national cricket team.[323]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nShanghai is located on the Yangtze Estuary of China's east coast, with the Yangtze River to the north and Hangzhou Bay to the south, with the East China Sea to the east. The land is formed by the Yangtze's natural deposition and modern land reclamation projects. As such, it has sandy soil, and skyscrapers have to be built with deep concrete piles to avoid sinking into the soft ground.[73] The provincial-level Municipality of Shanghai administers both the estuary and many of its surrounding islands. It borders the provinces of Zhejiang to the south and Jiangsu to the west and north.[74] The municipality's northernmost point is on Chongming Island, which is the second-largest island in mainland China after its expansion during the 20th century.[75] It does not administratively include an exclave of Jiangsu on northern Chongming or the two islands forming Shanghai's Yangshan Port, which are parts of Zhejiang's Shengsi County.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n59. **^** \"149 comfort women houses discovered in Shanghai\".

More than nine-tenths of the population are literate and roughly the same proportion of those age 7 to 14 are enrolled in school. There are 578 universities in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo.[122]\n\n\nThe city of S\u00e3o Paulo is also home to research and development facilities and attracts companies due to the presence of regionally renowned universities. Science, technology and innovation is leveraged by the allocation of funds from the state government, mainly carried out by means of the Foundation to Research Support in the State of S\u00e3o Paulo (Funda\u00e7\u00e3o de Amparo \u00e0 Pesquisa do Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo\u00a0\u2013 FAPESP), one of the main agencies promoting scientific and technological research.[123]\n\n\n\n### Health care[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Health in Brazil\n\nSee also: Rede S\u00e3o Paulo Saud\u00e1vel\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**S\u00e3o Paulo** (/\u02ccsa\u028a \u02c8pa\u028alo\u028a/, Portuguese: [s\u0250\u0303w\u0303 \u02c8pawlu] \u24d8; Portuguese for 'Saint Paul') is the most populous city in Brazil and the capital of the state of S\u00e3o Paulo. Listed by the GaWC as an alpha global city, S\u00e3o Paulo is the most populous city outside of Asia and the world's 4th largest city proper by population. Additionally, S\u00e3o Paulo is the largest Portuguese-speaking city in the world. It exerts strong international influences in commerce, finance, arts and entertainment.[8] The city's name honors the Apostle, Saint Paul of Tarsus. The city's metropolitan area, the Greater S\u00e3o Paulo, ranks as the most populous in Brazil and the 12th most populous on Earth. The process of conurbation between the metropolitan areas around the Greater S\u00e3o Paulo (Campinas, Santos, Jundia\u00ed, Sorocaba and S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 dos Campos) created the S\u00e3o Paulo Macrometropolis,[9] a megalopolis with more than 30 million inhabitants, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nS\u00e3o Paulo is a cosmopolitan, melting pot city, home to the largest Arab, Italian, and Japanese diasporas, with examples including ethnic neighborhoods of Bixiga, Bom Retiro, and Liberdade. In 2016, inhabitants of the city were native to over 200 countries.[18] People from the city are known as *paulistanos*, while *paulistas* designates anyone from the state, including the *paulistanos*. The city's Latin motto, which it has shared with the battleship and the aircraft carrier named after it, is *Non ducor, duco*, which translates as \"I am not led, I lead.\"[19] The city, which is also colloquially known as *Sampa*, *Selva de Pedra* (Jungle of Stone)[20] or *Terra da Garoa* (Land of Drizzle), is known for its unreliable weather, the size of its helicopter fleet, its architecture, gastronomy, severe traffic congestion and skyscrapers. S\u00e3o Paulo was one of the host cities of the 1950 and the 2014 FIFA World Cup. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n88. **^** \"S\u00e3o Paulo is the largest city in the portuguese speaking world\".

Nahuatl, Otomi, Mixtec, Zapotec and Mazahua are the indigenous languages with the greatest number of speakers in Mexico City.[123] According to the 2020 Census, 2.03% of Mexico City's population identified as Black, Afro-Mexican, or of African descent.[124]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 29 January 2016, Mexico City ceased to be the *Federal District* (Spanish: *Distrito Federal* or D.F.), and was officially renamed \"Ciudad de M\u00e9xico\" (or \"CDMX\").[28] On that date, Mexico City began a transition to becoming the country's 32nd federal entity, giving it a level of autonomy comparable to that of a state. It will have its own constitution and its legislature, and its *delegaciones* will now be headed by mayors.[28] Because of a clause in the Mexican Constitution, however, as it is the seat of the powers of the federation, it can never become a state, or the capital of the country has to be relocated elsewhere.[30]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Articles related to Mexico City\n |\n| --- |\n| | * v\n* t\n* e\nHistoric center of Mexico City\n |\n| --- |\n| Z\u00f3caloand immediate vicinity | * Administrative buildings\n* Metropolitan Cathedral\n\t+ Cruz de Ma\u00f1ozca\n\t+ Fountain to Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas\n\t+ Monument to Pope John Paul II\n* Nacional Monte de Piedad\n* National Palace\n* Old Portal de Mercaderes\n* Templo Mayor\n |\n| Schools and colleges | * Academia Mexicana de la Historia\n* Academy of San Carlos\n* Antigua Escuela de Jurisprudencia\n* Colegio de San Ignacio de Loyola Vizca\u00ednas\n* El Colegio Nacional\n* University of the Cloister of Sor Juana\n |\n| Government buildings | * Library of the Congress of Mexico\n* Old Customs Building\n* Palace of the Marqu\u00e9s del Apartado\n* Secretariat of Public Education Main Headquarters\n* Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation\n |\n| Religious buildings | * Church of Jesus Nazareno\n* Church of San Felipe Neri \"La Profesa\"\n* Church of San Hip\u00f3lito\n* Church of Santa In\u00e9s\n* Convent of La Merced\n* Convent of San Francisco\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
