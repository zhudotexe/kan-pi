The population of the city proper is the third largest in the world, with 24.89 million inhabitants in 2021, while the urban area is the most populous in China, with 39.3 million residents. As of 2018, the Greater Shanghai metropolitan area was estimated to produce a gross metropolitan product (nominal) of nearly 9.1 trillion RMB ($1.33 trillion). Shanghai is one of the world's major centers for finance, business and economics, research, science and technology, manufacturing, transportation, tourism, and culture, and the Port of Shanghai is the world's busiest container port.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)The F-22P frigate built by Hudong-Zhonghua for the Pakistan Navy\nAs one of the main industrial centers of China, Shanghai plays a key role in domestic manufacturing and heavy industry. Several industrial zones—including Shanghai Hongqiao Economic and Technological Development Zone, Jinqiao Export Economic Processing Zone, Minhang Economic and Technological Development Zone, and Shanghai Caohejing High-Tech Development Zone—are backbones of Shanghai's secondary sector. Shanghai is home to China's largest steelmaker Baosteel Group, China's largest shipbuilding base Hudong-Zhonghua Shipbuilding Group, and one of China's oldest shipbuilders, the Jiangnan Shipyard.[157][158] Auto manufacturing is another important industry. The Shanghai-based SAIC Motor is one of the three largest automotive corporations in China, and has strategic partnerships with Volkswagen and General Motors.[159]\n\n\n\n### Tourism[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of tourist attractions in Shanghai.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1990, Deng Xiaoping permitted Shanghai to initiate economic reforms, which reintroduced foreign capital to the city and developed the Pudong district, resulting in the birth of Lujiazui.[69] That year, the China's central government designated Shanghai as the \"Dragon Head\" of economic reform.[70] As of 2020, Shanghai is classified as an Alpha+ city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network, making it one of the world's Top 10 major cities.[71]\n\n\nIn early 2022, Shanghai experienced a large outbreak of COVID-19 cases. After localized lockdowns failed to stem the rise in cases, the Chinese government locked down the entire city on 5 April. This resulted in widespread food shortages across the city emerged as food-supply chains were severely disrupted by the government's lockdown measures, which was not lifted until 1 June.[72]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Shanghai\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMost populous and developed city in China\n\nFor other uses, see Shanghai (disambiguation).\n\n\n\n\n\nMunicipality in China\n\n\n| Shanghai\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n120. **^** 纪念型. 上海地名志 [*Shanghai Place Names*].

Following a 45-year dormancy after the founding of the PRC in 1949, the club was re-established in 1994 by expatriates living in the city and has since grown to over 300 members. The Shanghai cricket team played various international matches between 1866 and 1948. With cricket in the rest of China almost non-existent, for that period they were the de facto China national cricket team.[323]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nShanghai is located on the Yangtze Estuary of China's east coast, with the Yangtze River to the north and Hangzhou Bay to the south, with the East China Sea to the east. The land is formed by the Yangtze's natural deposition and modern land reclamation projects. As such, it has sandy soil, and skyscrapers have to be built with deep concrete piles to avoid sinking into the soft ground.[73] The provincial-level Municipality of Shanghai administers both the estuary and many of its surrounding islands. It borders the provinces of Zhejiang to the south and Jiangsu to the west and north.[74] The municipality's northernmost point is on Chongming Island, which is the second-largest island in mainland China after its expansion during the 20th century.[75] It does not administratively include an exclave of Jiangsu on northern Chongming or the two islands forming Shanghai's Yangshan Port, which are parts of Zhejiang's Shengsi County.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n59. **^** \"149 comfort women houses discovered in Shanghai\".

Nahuatl, Otomi, Mixtec, Zapotec and Mazahua are the indigenous languages with the greatest number of speakers in Mexico City.[123] According to the 2020 Census, 2.03% of Mexico City's population identified as Black, Afro-Mexican, or of African descent.[124]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 29 January 2016, Mexico City ceased to be the *Federal District* (Spanish: *Distrito Federal* or D.F.), and was officially renamed \"Ciudad de México\" (or \"CDMX\").[28] On that date, Mexico City began a transition to becoming the country's 32nd federal entity, giving it a level of autonomy comparable to that of a state. It will have its own constitution and its legislature, and its *delegaciones* will now be headed by mayors.[28] Because of a clause in the Mexican Constitution, however, as it is the seat of the powers of the federation, it can never become a state, or the capital of the country has to be relocated elsewhere.[30]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Articles related to Mexico City\n |\n| --- |\n| | * v\n* t\n* e\nHistoric center of Mexico City\n |\n| --- |\n| Zócaloand immediate vicinity | * Administrative buildings\n* Metropolitan Cathedral\n\t+ Cruz de Mañozca\n\t+ Fountain to Bartolomé de las Casas\n\t+ Monument to Pope John Paul II\n* Nacional Monte de Piedad\n* National Palace\n* Old Portal de Mercaderes\n* Templo Mayor\n |\n| Schools and colleges | * Academia Mexicana de la Historia\n* Academy of San Carlos\n* Antigua Escuela de Jurisprudencia\n* Colegio de San Ignacio de Loyola Vizcaínas\n* El Colegio Nacional\n* University of the Cloister of Sor Juana\n |\n| Government buildings | * Library of the Congress of Mexico\n* Old Customs Building\n* Palace of the Marqués del Apartado\n* Secretariat of Public Education Main Headquarters\n* Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation\n |\n| Religious buildings | * Church of Jesus Nazareno\n* Church of San Felipe Neri \"La Profesa\"\n* Church of San Hipólito\n* Church of Santa Inés\n* Convent of La Merced\n* Convent of San Francisco\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_gSkL7MD2aIBEen4go876yxEr","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

New Delhi is jointly administered by the federal government of India and the local government of Delhi, and serves as the capital of the nation as well as the NCT of Delhi. Delhi is also the centre of the National Capital Region, which is an \"interstate regional planning\" area created in 1985.[20][21] Delhi hosted the inaugural 1951 Asian Games, the 1982 Asian Games, the 1983 Non-Aligned Movement summit, the 2010 Men's Hockey World Cup, the 2010 Commonwealth Games, and the 2012 BRICS summit and was one of the major host cities of the 2011 Cricket World Cup and 2023 Cricket World Cup\n\n\n\n\n## Toponym[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Rapid Transit | Delhi Metro |\n| Literacy (2011) | 86.21%[11] |\n| Sex ratio (2011) | 868 ♀/1000 ♂[11] |\n| Website | delhi.gov.in |\n\n\n**Delhi**,[a] officially the **National Capital Territory** (**NCT**) **of Delhi**, is a city and a union territory of India containing New Delhi, the capital of India.

During the Meiji Restoration in 1868, the name of the city was changed to Tokyo (東京, from 東 *tō* \"east\", and 京 *kyō* \"capital\"), when it became the new imperial capital,[18] in line with the East Asian tradition of including the word capital (京) in the name of the capital city (for example, Kyoto (京都), Keijō (京城), Beijing (北京), Nanjing (南京), and Xijing (西京)).[17] During the early Meiji period, the city was sometimes called \"Tōkei\", an alternative pronunciation for the same characters representing \"Tokyo\", making it a kanji homograph. Some surviving official English documents use the spelling \"Tokei\";[19] however, this pronunciation is now obsolete.[20]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Tokyo\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Tokyo** (/ˈtoʊkioʊ/;[7] Japanese: 東京, *Tōkyō*, [toːkʲoː] ⓘ), officially the **Tokyo Metropolis** (東京都, *Tōkyō-to*), is the capital of Japan and the most populous city in the world with a population of over 14 million residents as of 2023.[8]\n\n\nThe Tokyo metropolitan area, which includes Tokyo and three neighboring Japanese prefectures, Tochigi, Gunma, and Ibaraki, is 13,452 square kilometers or 5,194 square miles and the world's most-populous metropolitan area with 40.8 million residents as of 2023[update].[9]\n\n\nLocated at the head of Tokyo Bay, Tokyo is part of the Kantō region on the central coast of Honshu, Japan's largest island.

There are 578 universities in the state of São Paulo.[122]\n\n\nThe city of São Paulo is also home to research and development facilities and attracts companies due to the presence of regionally renowned universities. Science, technology and innovation is leveraged by the allocation of funds from the state government, mainly carried out by means of the Foundation to Research Support in the State of São Paulo (Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo – FAPESP), one of the main agencies promoting scientific and technological research.[123]\n\n\n\n### Health care[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Health in Brazil\n\nSee also: Rede São Paulo Saudável\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**São Paulo** (/ˌsaʊ ˈpaʊloʊ/, Portuguese: [sɐ̃w̃ ˈpawlu] ⓘ; Portuguese for 'Saint Paul') is the most populous city in Brazil and the capital of the state of São Paulo. Listed by the GaWC as an alpha global city, São Paulo is the most populous city outside of Asia and the world's 4th largest city proper by population. Additionally, São Paulo is the largest Portuguese-speaking city in the world. It exerts strong international influences in commerce, finance, arts and entertainment.[8] The city's name honors the Apostle, Saint Paul of Tarsus. The city's metropolitan area, the Greater São Paulo, ranks as the most populous in Brazil and the 12th most populous on Earth. The process of conurbation between the metropolitan areas around the Greater São Paulo (Campinas, Santos, Jundiaí, Sorocaba and São José dos Campos) created the São Paulo Macrometropolis,[9] a megalopolis with more than 30 million inhabitants, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSão Paulo is a cosmopolitan, melting pot city, home to the largest Arab, Italian, and Japanese diasporas, with examples including ethnic neighborhoods of Bixiga, Bom Retiro, and Liberdade. In 2016, inhabitants of the city were native to over 200 countries.[18] People from the city are known as *paulistanos*, while *paulistas* designates anyone from the state, including the *paulistanos*. The city's Latin motto, which it has shared with the battleship and the aircraft carrier named after it, is *Non ducor, duco*, which translates as \"I am not led, I lead.\"[19] The city, which is also colloquially known as *Sampa*, *Selva de Pedra* (Jungle of Stone)[20] or *Terra da Garoa* (Land of Drizzle), is known for its unreliable weather, the size of its helicopter fleet, its architecture, gastronomy, severe traffic congestion and skyscrapers. São Paulo was one of the host cities of the 1950 and the 2014 FIFA World Cup. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n88. **^** \"São Paulo is the largest city in the portuguese speaking world\".
