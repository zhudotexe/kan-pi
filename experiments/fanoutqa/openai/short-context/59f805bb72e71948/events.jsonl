It was incorporated into Morocco's modern state university system in 1963 and officially renamed \"University of Al Quaraouiyine\" two years later.[1] The mosque building itself is also a significant complex of historical Moroccan and Islamic architecture that features elements from many different periods of Moroccan history.[5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nthe student numbers at al-Qarawiyyin decreased to 300 in 1922 as the Moroccan elite sent their children to the newly founded Western-style colleges and institutes elsewhere in the country.[1] In 1931 and 1933, on the orders of Muhammad V, al-Qarawiyyin's teaching was reorganized into elementary, secondary, and higher education.[30][26][50]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nUniversity in Fez, Morocco\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of al-Qarawiyyin| جامعة القرويين ⵜⴰⵙⴷⴰⵡⵉⵜ ⵏ ⵍⵇⴰⵕⴰⵡⵉⵢⵉⵏ\n |\n| ![](image)Courtyard of the mosque and its minaret\n |\n| Type | Madrasa and center of higher learning for non-vocational sciences (before 1963)State university since 1963[1][2][3] |\n| Established | 857–859 (as a mosque),1963 (as a state university)[4] |\n| Academic staff\n | 1,025 (2012) |\n| Administrative staff\n | 708 (2012) |\n| Students | 8,120 (2012) |\n| Location | Fez\n, Morocco\n |\n| Campus | Urban |\n| Language | Arabic, Tamazight, French |\n| Founder | Fatima al-Fihri |\n| Colours | White |\n| Website | uaq.ma |\n| ![](image) |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nEducation at the University of al-Qarawiyyin concentrates on the Islamic religious and legal sciences with a heavy emphasis on, and particular strengths in, Classical Arabic grammar/linguistics and *Maliki* Sharia, though lessons on non-Islamic subjects are also offered to students. Teaching is still delivered in the traditional methods.[14] The university is attended by students from all over Morocco and Muslim West Africa, with some also coming from further abroad. Women were first admitted to the institution in the 1940s.[15]\n\n\n\n\n## Name[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMost students at al-Qarawiyyin range are between 13 and 30 years old, and study towards high school-level diplomas and university-level bachelor's degrees, although Muslims with a sufficiently high level of Arabic can attend lecture circles on an informal basis, given the traditional category of visitors \"in search of [religious and legal] knowledge\" (\"zuwwaar li'l-talab fii 'ilm\"). In addition to being Muslim, prospective students of al-Qarawiyyin are required to have fully memorized the Quran, as well as other shorter medieval Islamic texts on grammar and *Maliki* law, and to be proficient in classical Arabic.[56][58]\n\n\n\n## Architecture of the mosque[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n> This is considerably later than the beginning of instruction at the al-Azhar under the Fatimids. So it is very difficult to sustain the claim that the University of Qarawiyyin is the \"oldest university\", and not only in the Muslim world! The mosque school or college did not assume the name of university until 1960 when in a ceremony Muhammad V invested it with that dignified title.[107]\n> \n> \n\n\n## Notable alumni[edit]\n\n\nA number of well-known philosophers, scholars, and politicians in the history of Morocco and the western Mediterranean have either studied or taught at the Qarawiyyin since its founding.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSome scholars consider that al-Qarawiyyin operated essentially as an Islamic madrasa until after World War II.[6][3][7][8][9] These scholars date al-Qarawiyyin's transformation into a university to its modern reorganization in 1963.[3][1][2] In the wake of these reforms, al-Qarawiyyin was officially renamed \"University of Al Quaraouiyine\" two years later.[1] Organization at the pre-modern al-Qarawiyyin differed from European universities and other Muslim institutions at al-Azhar (in Cairo) and al-Zaytouna (in Tunis) in that there was no defined scholastic year, registration was not imposed, study durations were not fixed, and there was no examination to ratify studies.[30] Students were expected to attend courses for a minimum of five years and would receive an *ijazah* if they were proven to have reached a high level of expertise.[22]: 457[30][102][43]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The main entrance to the library and other southern annexes of the mosque today, off Place SeffarineIn 1947 al-Qarawiyyin was integrated into the state educational system,[7] and women were first admitted to study there during the 1940s.[15] In 1963, after Moroccan independence, al-Qarawiyyin was officially transformed by royal decree into a university under the supervision of the ministry of education.[1][53][2] Classes at the old mosque ceased and a new campus was established at a former French Army barracks.[1] While the dean took his seat at Fez, four faculties were founded in and outside the city: a faculty of Islamic law in Fez, a faculty of Arab studies in Marrakech, and two faculties of theology in Tétouan and near Agadir. Modern curricula and textbooks were introduced and the professional training of the teachers improved.[1][54] Following the reforms, al-Qarawiyyin was officially renamed \"University of Al Quaraouiyine\" in 1965.[1]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Arabic name of the university, جَامِعَةُ الْقَرَوِيِّينَ pronounced [ʒaːmiʕtu lqarawijiːn] means \"University of the People from Kairouan (القَيْرَوَان [alqajrawaːn])\". Factors such as the provenance of Fatima al-Fihriya's family in Tunisia,[16] the presence of the letter *Qāf* (ق) – a voiceless uvular plosive which has no equivalent in European languages – the ويّي ([awijiː]) triphthong in the university's name, and the French colonization of Morocco have resulted in a number of different orthographies for the romanization of the university's name, including *al-Qarawiyyin*, a standard anglicization; *Al Quaraouiyine*, following French orthography; and *Al-Karaouine*, another rendering using French orthography.\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)View of the Qarawiyyin Mosque on the skyline of central Fes el-Bali: the green-tiled roofs of the prayer hall and the minaret (white tower on the left) are visible.\n### Foundation of the mosque[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nScholars consider al-Qarawiyyin to have been effectively run as a madrasa until after World War II.[6][3][7][8][9] Many scholars distinguish this status from the status of \"university\", which they view as a distinctly European invention.[10][11] They date al-Qarawiyyin's transformation from a madrasa into a university to its modern reorganization in 1963.[1][2][3] Some sources, such as UNESCO and the *Guinness World Records*, have cited al-Qarawiyyin as the oldest university or oldest continually operating higher learning institution in the world.[12][13]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Scholar at the Al-Qarawiyyin library\nEducation at al-Qarawiyyin University concentrates on the Islamic religious and legal sciences with a heavy emphasis on, and particular strengths in, Classical Arabic grammar/linguistics and Maliki law, though some lessons on other non-Islamic subjects such as French and English are also offered to students.[56][57] Teaching is delivered with students seated in a semi-circle around a sheikh, who prompts them to read sections of a particular text; asks them questions on particular points of grammar, law, or interpretation; and explains difficult points. Students from Morocco and Islamic West Africa attend al-Qarawiyyin, though some come from Muslim Central Asia. Spanish Muslim converts frequently attend the institution, largely attracted by the fact that the sheikhs of al-Qarawiyyin, and Islamic scholarship in Morocco in general, are heirs to the rich, religious, and scholarly heritage of Muslim al-Andalus.[56]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n83. **^** Hardaker, Glenn; Ahmad Sabki, A'ishah (2012). \"An insight into Islamic pedagogy at the University of al-Qarawiyyin\". *Multicultural Education & Technology Journal*. **6** (2): 106–110. doi:10.1108/17504971211236308.\n84. **^** Gathiram, Prem; Hänninen, Osmo (2014). \"Medicine and medical sciences in Africa\". *Pathophysiology*. **21** (2): 129–133. doi:10.1016/j.pathophys.2013.11.003.

It was founded as a mosque in Fès in the middle of the ninth century. It has been a destination for students and scholars of Islamic sciences and Arabic studies throughout the history of Morocco. There were also other religious schools like the madras of ibn yusuf and other schools in the sus. This system of basic education called al-ta'lim al-aSil was funded by the sultans of Morocco and many famous traditional families. After independence, al-qarawiyin maintained its reputation, but it seemed important to transform it into a university that would prepare graduates for a modern country while maintaining an emphasis on Islamic studies. Hence, al-qarawiyin university was founded in February 1963 and, while the dean's residence was kept in Fès, the new university initially had four colleges located in major regions of the country known for their religious influences and madrasas. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n> As for the nature of its curriculum, it was typical of other major madrasahs such as al-Azhar and Al Qarawiyyin, though many of the texts used at the institution came from Muslim Spain [...] Al-Qarawiyyin began its life as a small mosque constructed in 859 C.E. by means of an endowment bequeathed by a wealthy woman of much piety, Fatima bint Muhammed al-Fahri.\n> \n>\n7. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Shillington, Kevin: *Encyclopedia of African History*, Vol. 2, Fitzroy Dearborn, 2005, ISBN 978-1-57958-245-6, p. 1025: \n> Higher education has always been an integral part of Morocco, going back to the ninth century when the Karaouine Mosque was established.

The strength of its teaching stagnated and its curriculum decreased in range and scope, becoming focused on traditional Islamic sciences and Arabic linguistic studies. Even some traditional Islamic specializations like *tafsir* (Quranic exegesis) were progressively neglected or abandoned.[1][30] In 1788–89, the Alaouite sultan Muhammad ibn Abdallah introduced reforms that regulated the institution's program, but also imposed stricter limits and excluded logic, philosophy, and the more radical Sufi texts from the curriculum.[26][30][50] Other subjects also disappeared over time, such as astronomy and medicine.[30] In 1845 Sultan Abd al-Rahman carried out further reforms, but it is unclear if this had any significant long-term effects.[1][30] Between 1830 and 1906 the number of faculty decreased from 425 to 266 (of which, among the latter, only 101 were still teaching).[1]: 71\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_itnUrBBYbpThCLCtLTX7BcIU","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

The University of Bologna has had a central role in the sciences during the medieval age and the Italian renaissance, where it housed and educated Nicholas Copernicus as well as numerous other renaissance mathematicians.[6] It has educated a wide range of notable alumni, amongst them a large number of Italian scientists, prime ministers, supreme court judges, and priests.[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe university arose around mutual aid societies (known as *universitates scholarium*) of foreign students called \"nations\" (as they were grouped by nationality) for protection against city laws which imposed collective punishment on foreigners for the crimes and debts of their countrymen. These students then hired scholars from the city's pre-existing lay and ecclesiastical schools to teach them subjects such as liberal arts, notarial law, theology, and *ars dictaminis* (scrivenery).[15] The lectures were given in informal schools called *scholae*. In time the various *universitates scholarium* decided to form a larger association, or *Studium*—thus, the university. The *Studium* grew to have a strong position of collective bargaining with the city, since by then it derived significant revenue through visiting foreign students, who would depart if they were not well treated. The foreign students in Bologna received greater rights, and collective punishment was ended. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n88. **^** \"Ulisse Aldrovandi | Italian naturalist\". *Encyclopedia Britannica*.

From 2015 to 2019, the state proportion of total UK students admitted each year was: 55.6%, 58.0%, 58.2%, 60.5% and 62.3%.[138] Oxford University spends over £6 million per year on outreach programs to encourage applicants from underrepresented demographics.[134]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Website | ox.ac.uk ![Edit this at Wikidata](image) |\n| ![](image) |\n\n\nThe **University of Oxford** is a collegiate research university in Oxford, England.

Thus the University of Paris assumed its basic form. It was composed of seven groups, the four nations of the faculty of arts, and the three superior faculties of theology, law, and medicine. Men who had studied at Paris became an increasing presence in the high ranks of the Church hierarchy; eventually, students at the University of Paris saw it as a right that they would be eligible to benefices. Church officials such as St. Louis and Clement IV lavishly praised the university.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOfficially chartered in 1200 by King Philip II of France and recognised in 1215 by Pope Innocent III, it was later often nicknamed after its theological College of Sorbonne, founded by Robert de Sorbon and chartered by King Louis IX around 1257.[1]\n\n\nHighly reputed internationally for its academic performance in the humanities ever since the Middle Ages – notably in theology and philosophy – it introduced several academic standards and traditions that have endured ever since and spread internationally, such as doctoral degrees and student nations. Notable popes, royalty, scientists, and intellectuals were educated at the University of Paris. A few of the colleges of the time are still visible close to the Panthéon and Jardin du Luxembourg: Collège des Bernardins (18 rue de Poissy, 5th arr.), Hôtel de Cluny (6 Place Paul Painlevé, 5th arr.), Collège Sainte-Barbe (4 rue Valette, 5th arr.), Collège d'Harcourt (44 Boulevard Saint-Michel, 6th arr.), and Cordeliers (21 rue École de Médecine, 6th arr.).[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe student revolts of the late 1960s were caused in part by the French government's failure to plan for a sudden explosion in the number of university students as a result of the postwar baby boom. The number of French university students skyrocketed from only 280,000 during the 1962–63 academic year to 500,000 in 1967–68, but at the start of the decade, there were only 16 public universities in the entire country. To accommodate this rapid growth, the government hastily developed bare-bones off-site faculties as annexes of existing universities (roughly equivalent to American satellite campuses). These faculties did not have university status of their own, and lacked academic traditions, amenities to support student life, or resident professors.

French students included princes of the blood, sons of the nobility, and ranking gentry. The courses at Paris were considered so necessary as a completion of studies that many foreigners flocked to them. Popes Celestine II, Adrian IV and Innocent III studied at Paris, and Alexander III sent his nephews there. Noted German and English students included Otto of Freisingen, Cardinal Conrad, Archbishop of Mainz, St. Thomas of Canterbury, and John of Salisbury; while Ste-Geneviève became practically the seminary for Denmark. The chroniclers of the time called Paris the city of letters par excellence, placing it above Athens, Alexandria, Rome, and other cities: \"At that time, there flourished at Paris philosophy and all branches of learning, and there the seven arts were studied and held in such esteem as they never were at Athens, Egypt, Rome, or elsewhere in the world.\" (\"Les gestes de Philippe-Auguste\"). \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1150, the future University of Paris was a student-teacher corporation operating as an annex of the Notre-Dame cathedral school. The earliest historical reference to it is found in Matthew Paris' reference to the studies of his own teacher (an abbot of St. Albans) and his acceptance into \"the fellowship of the elect Masters\" there in about 1170,[4] and it is known that Lotario dei Conti di Segni, the future Pope Innocent III, completed his studies there in 1182 at the age of 21.\n\n\nThe corporation was formally recognised as an \"*Universitas*\" in an edict by King Philippe-Auguste in 1200: in it, among other accommodations granted to future students, he allowed the corporation to operate under ecclesiastic law which would be governed by the elders of the Notre-Dame Cathedral school, and assured all those completing courses there that they would be granted a diploma.[5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 1966, after a student revolt in Paris, Christian Fouchet, minister of education, proposed \"the reorganisation of university studies into separate two- and four-year degrees, alongside the introduction of selective admission criteria\" as a response to overcrowding in lecture halls.[13] Dissatisfied with these educational reforms, students began protesting in November 1967, at the campus of the University of Paris in Nanterre;[14] indeed, according to James Marshall, these reforms were seen \"as the manifestations of the technocratic-capitalist state by some, and by others as attempts to destroy the liberal university\".[15] After student activists protested against the Vietnam War, the campus was closed by authorities on 22 March and again on 2 May 1968.[16] Agitation spread to the Sorbonne the next day, and many students were arrested in the following week.[17] Barricades were erected throughout the Latin Quarter, and a massive demonstration took place on 13 May, \n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_gSkL7MD2aIBEen4go876yxEr","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

The university was founded as a *studium generale* by the Leonese king Alfonso IX in 1218 as the *scholas Salamanticae*, with the actual creation of the university (or the transformation of the existing school into the university) occurring between August 1218 and the following winter.[1] A further royal charter from King Alfonso X, dated 8 May 1254, established rules for the organisation and financial endowment of the university, and referred to it for the first time by that name.[10] A papal bull of Alexander IV in 1255 confirmed the Royal Charter of Alfonso X and granted universal recognition to the university's degrees.[11]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn popular belief, the university was associated with sorcery. A certain cave in Salamanca was considered the site of a school of black magic. In Spanish, Salamanca may mean \"cave\", \"an evil iguana\" and \"hand trick\"[14] and the *salamanquesa* (*Tarentola mauritanica*, the Spanish name is also derived from \"salamander\") is a reptile with magical attributes in Spanish tradition.[15]\nIn Romanian folklore, the devil runs a school of black magic named *Scholomance*.\n\n\nThe name is derived from \"Salamanca\" and the wise king \"Solomon\".[16][17]\n\n\n\n## Present day[edit]\n\n\nSalamanca draws undergraduate and graduate students from across Spain and the world; it is the top-ranked university in Spain based on the number of students coming from other regions.[18] It is also known for its Spanish courses for non-native speakers, which attract more than two thousand foreign students each year.[19]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n10. **^** Álvarez Villar, Julián (1972). *La Universidad de Salamanca: arte y tradiciones*. p. 15.

These were founded as charitable institutions to enable poor scholars to attend the university. By the eighteenth century they had become closed corporations controlled by the families of their founders, and dominated the university between them. Most were destroyed by Napoleon's troops. In the 19th century, the Spanish government dissolved the university's faculties of canon law and theology. They were later reestablished in the 1940s as part of the Pontifical University of Salamanca.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Related affairs[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe faculty renovated the theology department, laid the foundation for modern-day law, international law, modern economic science and actively participated in the Council of Trent. The school's mathematicians studied the calendar reform, commissioned by Pope Gregory XIII and proposed the solution that was later implemented. By 1580, 6,500 new students had arrived at Salamanca each year, amongst the graduates were state officials of the Spanish monarchy administration. It was also during this period when the first female university students were probably admitted, Beatriz Galindo and Luisa de Medrano, the latter probably being the first woman ever to give classes at a university.[13]\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n### Sorcery[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Andalusia | * Almería\n* Cádiz\n* Córdoba\n* Granada\n* Huelva\n* International University of Andalucía\n* Jaén\n* Malaga\n* Pablo de Olavide\n* Seville\n |\n| Castile and León | * Burgos\n* León\n* Salamanca\n* Valladolid\n |\n| Canary Islands | * La Laguna\n* Las Palmas de Gran Canaria\n |\n| Catalonia | * Autonomous University of Barcelona\n* Barcelona\n* Girona\n* Lleida\n* Open University of Catalonia\n* Polytechnic University of Catalonia\n* Pompeu Fabra\n* Rovira i Virgili\n |\n| Galicia | * A Coruña\n* Santiago de Compostela\n* Vigo\n |\n|  Madrid | * Alcalá\n* Autonomous University of Madrid\n* Carlos III\n* Complutense University of Madrid\n* Menéndez Pelayo International University\n* UNED\n* King Juan Carlos\n* Technical University of Madrid\n |\n|  Murcia | * Murcia\n* Technical University of Cartagena\n |\n| Valencian Community | * Alicante\n* Jaume I\n* Miguel Hernández\n* Polytechnic University of Valencia\n* Valencia\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n### Notable staff[edit]\n\n\n* Juan de Galavís, professor of theology; later became Archbishop of Santo Domingo and Archbishop of Bogotá\n* Francisco Elías de Tejada y Spínola, professor of Philosophy of Law and Natural Law\n* Enrique Gil Robles, professor of Natural Law\n* Paul Nuñez Coronel (d.1534), professor of Hebrew\n* Miguel de Unamuno, writer\n* Beatriz Galindo, (d. 1534), professor of Latin and rhetoric\n* Luisa de Medrano (d. 1527) professor of Latin.
