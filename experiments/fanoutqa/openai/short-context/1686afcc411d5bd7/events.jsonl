This redesign included physical changes to the Apple Stores, such as open spaces and re-branded rooms, as well as changes in function to facilitate interaction between consumers and professionals.[219]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n284. **^** Goel, Vindu (November 20, 2016). \"How Apple Empowers, and Employs, the American Working Class\". *The New York Times*.

Facebook opened an office in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 2018.

Meta is making use of the Double Irish arrangement which allows it to pay 2–3% corporation tax on all international revenue.[164] In 2010, Facebook opened its fourth office, in Hyderabad, India,[165] which houses online advertising and developer support teams and provides support to users and advertisers.[166] In India, Meta is registered as Facebook India Online Services Pvt Ltd.[167] It also has support centers in Chittagong; Dublin;[*clarification needed*] California; Ireland; and Austin, Texas.[168][*not specific enough to verify*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn June 2022, Meta settled a lawsuit with the US Department of Justice. The lawsuit, which was filed in 2019, alleged that the company enabled housing discrimination through targeted advertising, as it allowed home owners and landlords to run housing ads excluding people based on sex, race, religion, and other characteristics. The US Department of Justice stated that this was in violation of the Fair Housing Act.

In late November 2019, Facebook, Inc. announced the acquisition of the game developer Beat Games, responsible for developing one of that year's most popular VR games, *Beat Saber*.[101] In Late 2022 after Facebook Inc rebranded to Meta Platforms Inc, Oculus was rebranded to Meta Quest.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n13. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Meta Platforms, Inc. 2022 Annual Report (Form 10-K)\".

The law enforcement requests sometimes included forged signatures of real or fictional officials. When asked about the allegations, a Meta representative said, \"We review every data request for legal sufficiency and use advanced systems and processes to validate law enforcement requests and detect abuse.\"[75] In June 2022, Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer of 14 years, announced she would step down that year.

Zuckerberg said the decision to aggressively increase Meta's investments had been a mistake, as he had wrongly predicted that the surge in e-commerce would last beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. He also attributed the decline to increased competition, a global economic downturn and \"ads signal loss\".[85] Plans to lay off a further 10,000 employees began in April 2023.[86] The layoffs were part of a general downturn in the technology industry, alongside layoffs by companies including Google, Amazon, Tesla, Snap, Twitter and Lyft.[87][88]\n\n\nMeta revenue surpassed analyst expectations for the first quarter of 2023 after announcing that it was increasing its focus on AI.[89] On July 6, 2023, Meta launched a new app, Threads, a competitor to Twitter.[90]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n86. **^** Goswami, Rohan; Vanian, Jonathan (April 19, 2023). \"Meta has started its latest round of layoffs, focusing on technical employees\". *CNBC*.

Meta Platforms Ireland is subject to the US GILTI tax of 10.5% on global intangible profits (i.e. Irish profits). On the basis that Meta Platforms Ireland Limited is paying some tax, the effective minimum US tax for Facebook Ireland will be circa 11%. In contrast, Meta Platforms Inc. would incur a special IP tax rate of 13.125% (the FDII rate) if its Irish business relocated to the US. Tax relief in the US (21% vs. Irish at the GILTI rate) and accelerated capital expensing, would make this effective US rate around 12%.[159][160][161]\n\n\nThe insignificance of the US/Irish tax difference was demonstrated when Facebook moved 1.5bn non-EU accounts to the US to limit exposure to GDPR.[162][163]\n\n\n\n## Facilities[edit]\n\n\n### Offices[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n119. **^** \"Meta Hit With 8 Suits Claiming Its Algorithms Hook Youth and Ruin Their Lives\". *Bloomberg*.

Every violation of the Privacy Act is subject to a theoretical cumulative liability of $1.7 million.

This was the first project to be unveiled out of Meta's generative AI group after it was set up in February. It would not charge access or usage but instead operate with an open-source model to allow Meta to ascertain what improvements need to be made. Prior to this announcement, Meta said it had no plans to release Llama 2 for commercial use. An earlier version of Llama was released to academics.[91][92]\n\n\nIn August 2023, Meta announced its permanent removal of news content from Facebook and Instagram in Canada due to the *Online News Act*, which requires Canadian news outlets to be compensated for content shared on its platform.

A computer that records the location of goods and maps out routes for pickers plays a key role: employees carry hand-held computers which communicate with the central computer and monitor their rate of progress.
