Established by Article III of the Constitution, the detailed structure of the court was laid down by the 1st United States Congress in 1789. Congress specified the Court's original and appellate jurisdiction, created 13 judicial districts, and fixed the initial size of the Supreme Court. The number of justices on the Supreme Court was changed six times before settling at the present total of nine in 1869.[1] A total of 115 persons have served on the Supreme Court since 1789. Justices have life tenure, and so they serve until they die in office, resign or retire, or are impeached and removed from office.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |\n| --- |\n| This article is part of a series on the |\n| Supreme Courtof the United States |\n| ![](image) |\n| \nThe Court |\n| * History\n* Procedures\n* Nomination and confirmation\n\t+ Judiciary Committee review\n* Demographics\n* Ideological leanings of justices\n* Lists of decisions\n* Supreme Court building\n |\n| \nCurrent membership |\n| Chief Justice* John Roberts\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nAssociate justices* Clarence Thomas\n* Samuel Alito\n* Sonia Sotomayor\n* Elena Kagan\n* Neil Gorsuch\n* Brett Kavanaugh\n* Amy Coney Barrett\n* Ketanji Brown Jackson\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nRetired justices* Anthony Kennedy\n* David Souter\n* Stephen Breyer\n |\n| \nLists of justices |\n| * List of all justices\n\t+ by court\n\t+ by time in office\n\t+ by seat\n\t+ by education\n* List of chief justices\n* List of associate justices\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nSpecialty lists\nAll nominations\nUnsuccessful nominations* Confirmation votes\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* **Associate justices:** Clarence Thomas\n* Samuel Alito\n* Sonia Sotomayor\n* Elena Kagan\n* Neil Gorsuch\n* Brett Kavanaugh\n* Amy Coney Barrett\n* Ketanji Brown Jackson\n |\n| Retired justices | * Anthony Kennedy\n* David Souter\n* Stephen Breyer\n |\n| History | * Jay Court (1789\u20131795)\n* Rutledge Court (1795)\n* Ellsworth Court (1796\u20131800)\n* Marshall Court (1801\u20131835)\n* Taney Court (1836\u20131864)\n* Chase Court (1864\u20131873)\n* Waite Court (1874\u20131888)\n* Fuller Court (1888\u20131910)\n* White Court (1910\u20131921)\n* Taft Court (1921\u20131930)\n* Hughes Court (1930\u20131941)\n* Stone Court (1941\u20131946)\n* Vinson Court (1946\u20131953)\n* Warren Court (1953\u20131969)\n* Burger Court (1969\u20131986)\n* Rehnquist Court (1986\u20132005)\n* Roberts Court (2005\u2013present)\n |\n| Lists of justicesand nominees | * Chief justices\n* Associate justices\n* All justices\n\t+ court\n\t+ education\n\t+ seat\n\t+ time in office\n* All nominations\n\t+ unsuccessful\n* Justices who served in Congress\n* Burial places of justices\n |\n| Statutes affectingcourt size | * Judiciary Act of 1789\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe graphical timeline below lists the **justices of the Supreme Court of the United States by court composition**.
