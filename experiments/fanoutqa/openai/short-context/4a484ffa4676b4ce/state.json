On December 26, Peter DeBoer was fired from the head coach position.[134] To replace him, Lamoriello invested in two head coaches, former Devils player Scott Stevens (who had been DeBoer's assistant for two years) and Adam Oates, with Lamoriello himself supervising the team during the first months.[135] The Devils finished the season as the sixth-worst team in the League, 20 points away from a playoff spot and with just one victory in the last 11 games.[136]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe **New Jersey Devils** are a professional ice hockey team based in Newark, New Jersey. The Devils compete in the National Hockey League (NHL) as a member of the Metropolitan Division in the Eastern Conference. The club was founded as the Kansas City Scouts in Kansas City, Missouri, in 1974. The Scouts moved to Denver in 1976 and became the Colorado Rockies. In 1982, they moved to East Rutherford, New Jersey, and took their current name, which is derived from the legendary Jersey Devil creature. For their first 25 seasons in New Jersey, the Devils were based at the Meadowlands Sports Complex in East Rutherford and played their home games at Brendan Byrne Arena (later renamed Continental Airlines Arena). Before the 2007\u201308 season, the Devils moved to Prudential Center in Newark.

On February 6, 2015, the Leafs set a new franchise record of 11 consecutive games without a win. At the beginning of February, Shanahan gained the approval of MLSE's board of directors to begin a \"scorched earth\" rebuild of the club.[134] Both Dave Nonis and Horachek were relieved of their duties on April 12, just one day after the season concluded. In addition, the Leafs also fired several assistant coaches, including Steve Spott, and Rick St. Croix; as well as individuals from the Leafs' player scouting department.[135][136]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn May 20, 2015, Mike Babcock was named as the new head coach, and on July 23, Lou Lamoriello was named the 16th general manager in team history.[137][138] On July 1, 2015, the Leafs packaged Kessel in a multi-player deal to the Pittsburgh Penguins in return for three skaters, including Kasperi Kapanen, a conditional first-round pick, and a third-round pick. Toronto also retained $1.2\u00a0million of Kessel's salary for the remaining seven seasons of his contract.[139] During the following season, on February 9, 2016, the Leafs packaged Phaneuf in another multi-player deal, acquiring four players, as well as a 2017 second-round pick from the Ottawa Senators.[140] The team finished last in the NHL for the first time since the 1984\u201385 season. They subsequently won the draft lottery and used the first overall pick to draft Auston Matthews.[141]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n134. **^** Kelly, Cathal (February 12, 2015). \"Shanahan's scorched-earth Leafs plan wins MLSE support\". *The Globe and Mail*.

However, the Leafs lost in seven games to eventual 2013 Stanley Cup finalist Boston in the first round.[130] Despite the season's success, it was not repeated during the 2013\u201314 season, as the Leafs failed to make the playoffs.[131]\n\n\n\n### Brendan Shanahan era (2014\u2013present)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Toronto Maple Leafs |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) *2023\u201324 Toronto Maple Leafs season* |\n| ![](image) |\n| Conference | Eastern |\n| Division | Atlantic |\n| Founded | 1917 |\n| History | **Toronto Arenas**1917\u20131919**Toronto St. Patricks**1919\u20131927**Toronto Maple Leafs**1927\u2013present |\n| Home arena | **Scotiabank Arena** |\n| City | Toronto, Ontario |\n| ![](image) |\n| Team colours | Blue, white[1][2]\u00a0 \u00a0 |\n| Media | Sportsnet OntarioTSN4*Sportsnet 590 The Fan* *TSN Radio 1050* |\n| Owner(s) | Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment Ltd.(Larry Tanenbaum, chairman) |\n| General manager | Brad Treliving |\n| Head coach | Sheldon Keefe |\n| Captain | John Tavares |\n| Minor league affiliates | Toronto Marlies (AHL)Newfoundland Growlers (ECHL) |\n| Stanley Cups | **13** (1917\u201318, 1921\u201322, 1931\u201332, 1941\u201342, 1944\u201345, 1946\u201347, 1947\u201348, 1948\u201349, 1950\u201351, 1961\u201362, 1962\u201363, 1963\u201364, 1966\u201367) |\n| Conference championships | **0** |\n| Presidents' Trophy | **0**[note 1] |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nwas fired in January 2008 and replaced by former Leafs' general manager Cliff Fletcher on an interim basis.[116] The team retained Toronto-based sports lawyer Gord Kirke to begin a search for a new team president and general manager, and negotiate a contract.[117] The Leafs did not qualify for the postseason, marking the first time since 1928 the team had failed to make the playoffs for three consecutive seasons.[118] It was also Sundin's last year with the Leafs, as his contract was due to expire at the end of the season.

Despite the adversity, the Penguins won the realigned, eight-team Metropolitan Division, though the club struggled in the playoffs, requiring six games to defeat the Columbus Blue Jackets, then losing to the New York Rangers in seven games despite leading the series 3\u20131 after four games. This collapse prompted Penguins ownership to fire general manager Shero, replacing him on June 6 with Jim Rutherford, the former general manager of the Carolina Hurricanes.[43] Rutherford's first action as general manager was to fire head coach Dan Bylsma, and on June 25, he announced that Mike Johnston was hired as Bylsma's replacement. In the 2014\u201315 season, the Penguins led the Metropolitan Division for the first half of the season. However, after losing players to injuries and illnesses, including the mumps, the team fell to fourth in the Division. The Pens lost in five games to the New York Rangers in the first round of the playoffs. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBefore the 2017\u201318 season, the Penguins lost longtime goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury in the 2017 NHL Expansion Draft to the Vegas Golden Knights.[51] Nevertheless, the Penguins again qualified for the Stanley Cup playoffs with the second division playoff spot, finishing the regular season with 100 points. They defeated the Philadelphia Flyers in the first round in six games, but were defeated by the eventual Stanley Cup champion Washington Capitals in six games.[52] In the next season, the Penguins clinched a playoff berth, but were swept by the New York Islanders in the First Round.[53] In the following season, which was shortened by the COVID-19 pandemic, the team advanced to the 2020 playoffs, but were defeated by the Montreal Canadiens in the Qualifying Round.[54] On February 9, 2021, the Penguins named Ron Hextall as their new general manager, after Jim Rutherford resigned from his post on January 27, because of personal reasons. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Ab McDonald, 1967\u20131968\n* Earl Ingarfield, 1968\u20131969\n* Ron Schock, 1973\u20131977\n* Jean Pronovost, 1977\u20131978\n* Orest Kindrachuk, 1978\u20131981\n* Randy Carlyle, 1981\u20131984\n* Mike Bullard, 1984\u20131986\n* Terry Ruskowski, 1986\u20131987\n* Dan Frawley, 1987\n* Mario Lemieux, 1987\u20131994, 1995\u20131997, 2001\u20132006\n* Ron Francis, 1995,[126] 1997\u20131998\n* Jaromir Jagr, 1998\u20132001\n* Sidney Crosby, 2007\u2013present\n\n### Franchise individual records[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of Pittsburgh Penguins records\n\nThese are the top-ten point-scorers in franchise history.[127] Figures are updated after each completed NHL regular season.\n\n\n\n* \\*\u00a0 \u2013 current Penguins player\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe 2022\u201323 season was marked with two milestones for the Penguins.

However, Evgeni Malkin, the Penguins' 2004 draft pick, could not report to Pittsburgh immediately because of a playing rights dispute with the Russian Superleague. The addition of Crosby paid instant dividends, with attendance rising by approximately 4,000 per game on average in the 2005\u201306 season.[18] However, Crosby's presence did not immediately translate into wins, as the team began the season with a long winless skid that resulted in a head coaching change from Olczyk to Michel Therrien. Then, on January 24, 2006, Lemieux announced his second retirement, after developing an irregular heartbeat, this time permanently. He finished as the NHL's seventh all-time scorer (1,723), eighth in goals (690) and tenth in assists (1,033), and with the second-highest career points per game average (1.88), which is second to Wayne Gretzky's 1.92.[30][31]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Pittsburgh Penguins Hockey Hall of Fame inductees\n |\n| --- |\n| Affiliation with inductees based on team acknowledgement\n |\n| Hall of Fame players[123] |\n| Andy BathgateLeo Boivin | Paul CoffeyRon Francis | Tim HortonMarian Hossa | Jarome IginlaMario Lemieux | Joe MullenLarry Murphy | Mark RecchiLuc Robitaille | Bryan TrottierSergei Zubov |\n| Hall of Fame builders[123] |\n|  | Scotty Bowman | Herb Brooks | Bob Johnson | Craig Patrick | Jim Rutherford |  |\n\n\n#### Team captains[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The team's current captain, Sidney Crosby, during a playoff game in 2016.\nAll the players who have served as team captain with the Penguins franchise\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n81. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** \"Penguins Uniform History\". *National Hockey League*.

In the spring of 1965, Jack McGregor, a state senator from Kittanning, Pennsylvania, began lobbying campaign contributors and community leaders to bring an NHL franchise back to Pittsburgh. The group focused on leveraging the NHL as an urban renewal tool for Pittsburgh. The senator formed a group of local investors that included H. J. Heinz Company heir H. J. Heinz\u00a0III, Pittsburgh Steelers' owner Art Rooney and the Mellon family's Richard Mellon Scaife. The projected league expansion depended on securing votes from the then-current NHL owners; to ensure Pittsburgh would be selected as one of the expansion cities, McGregor enlisted Rooney to petition votes from James D. Norris, owner of the Chicago Black Hawks and his brother Bruce Norris, owner of the Detroit Red Wings. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPearson award. Following the Penguins' disappointing playoff exit, general manager Ray Shero made changes to the team at the 2012 NHL Entry Draft for the upcoming 2012\u201313 season.[40][41]\n\n\nDuring the lockout-shortened 2012\u201313 season, the Penguins again fought through serious injury. At the end of the regular season, they finished atop the Eastern Conference, matching up against the New York Islanders in round one. The Penguins defeated the Islanders in six games, with Fleury struggling once again. The team then dispatched the Ottawa Senators in five games before being swept in the Conference Finals by the Boston Bruins, scoring just two goals in the entire four-game sweep. On June 13, 2013, Malkin signed an eight-year contract extension worth an annual average of $9.5\u00a0million.[42]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
