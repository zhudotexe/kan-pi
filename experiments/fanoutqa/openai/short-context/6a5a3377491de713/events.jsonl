The ninth film, *The Artist* (2011), was financed in France and the tenth film, *Parasite* (2019), was financed in South Korea.[26]\n\n\n\n### Rating[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the list below, winners are listed first in the gold row, followed by the other nominees.[6] Except for the early years (when the Academy used a non-calendar year), the year shown is the one in which the film first premiered in Los Angeles County, California; normally this is also the year of first release, however, it may be the year after first release (as with *Casablanca* and, if the film-festival premiere is considered, *Crash*). This is also the year before the ceremony at which the award is given; for example, a film exhibited theatrically during 2005 was eligible for consideration for the 2005 Best Picture Oscar, awarded in 2006. The number of the ceremony (1st, 2nd, etc.) appears in parentheses after the awards year, linked to the article on that ceremony. Each individual entry shows the title followed by nominee.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Year of Film Release\n | Film\n | Producer(s)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **2010**(83rd) |\n| ***The King's Speech*** | **Iain Canning, Emile Sherman, and Gareth Unwin** |\n| *Black Swan* | Scott Franklin, Mike Medavoy, and Brian Oliver |\n| *The Fighter* | David Hoberman, Todd Lieberman, and Mark Wahlberg |\n| *Inception* | Christopher Nolan and Emma Thomas |\n| *The Kids Are All Right* | Gary Gilbert, Jeffrey Levy-Hinte, and Celine Rattray |\n| *127 Hours* | Danny Boyle, John Smithson, and Christian Colson |\n| *The Social Network* | Dana Brunetti, Ceán Chaffin, Michael De Luca, and Scott Rudin |\n| *Toy Story 3* | Darla K.

If there are only eight pictures that truly earn that honor in a given year, we shouldn't feel an obligation to round out the number.\"[21] This system lasted until 2021, when the Academy reverted back to a set number of ten nominees from the 94th Academy Awards onward.[22]\n\n\n\n### Language and country of origin[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n25. **^** \"Everything to Know about Nominee 'Minari'\" Archived January 27, 2022, at the Wayback Machine (March 15, 2021). *Los Angeles Times*.

However, attendance was estimated at being down 2.5% from 1999.[72][73] Industry executives blamed the decrease in attendance on the year's slate for its lack of commercial appeal, a dearth of female-driven films and sleeper hits, as well as several exhibition chains filing for bankruptcy.[74][73] Nevertheless, *Gladiator* was considered to be one of 2000's biggest blockbusters due to strong word of mouth, contributing to its long-lasting box office performance and DreamWorks' improving fortunes.[75][73][74]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nEmpire Award for Best Film\n |\n| --- |\n| * *Braveheart* (1996)\n* *Se7en* (1997)\n* *Men in Black* (1998)\n* *Titanic* (1999)\n* *The Matrix* (2000)\n* *Gladiator* (2001)\n* *The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring* (2002)\n* *The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers* (2003)\n* *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King* (2004)\n* *The Bourne Supremacy* (2005)\n* *King Kong* (2006)\n* *Casino Royale* (2007)\n* *The Bourne Ultimatum* (2008)\n* *The Dark Knight* (2009)\n* *Avatar* (2010)\n* *Inception* (2011)\n* *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2* (2012)\n* *Skyfall* (2013)\n* *Gravity* (2014)\n* *Interstellar* (2015)\n* *The Revenant* (2016)\n* *Rogue One* (2017)\n* *Star Wars: The Last Jedi* (2018)\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nBAFTA Award for Best Film\n |\n| --- |\n| Best Filmfrom Any Source1947–1967 | * *The Best Years of Our Lives* (1947)\n* *Hamlet* (1948)\n* *Bicycle Thieves* (1949)\n* *All About Eve* (1950)\n* *La Ronde* (1951)\n* *The Sound Barrier* (1952)\n* *Forbidden Games* (1953)\n* *The Wages of Fear* (1954)\n* *Richard III* (1955)\n* *Gervaise* (1956)\n* *The Bridge on the River Kwai* (1957)\n* *Room at the Top* (1958)\n* *Ben-Hur* (1959)\n* *The Apartment* (1960)\n* *Ballad of a Soldier* (1961)\n* *The Hustler* (1961)\n* *Lawrence of Arabia* (1962)\n* *Tom Jones* (1963)\n* *Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb* (1964)\n* *My Fair Lady* (1965)\n* *Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?* (1966)\n* *A Man for All Seasons* (1967)\n |\n| Best Film1968–present | * *The Graduate* (1968)\n* *Midnight Cowboy* (1969)\n* *Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid* (1970)\n* *Sunday Bloody Sunday* (1971)\n* *Cabaret* (1972)\n* *Day for Night* (1973)\n* *Lacombe, Lucien* (1974)\n* *Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore* (1975)\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_1s6SmXUDBLGzLMI8ZaNiSr0T","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

A self-described \"passion piece\" for Haggis, the film features racial and social tensions in Los Angeles and was inspired by a real-life incident in which Haggis's Porsche was carjacked in 1991 outside a video store on Wilshire Boulevard.[3] The film features an ensemble cast, including Sandra Bullock, Don Cheadle (who also worked as a producer on the film), Matt Dillon, Jennifer Esposito, William Fichtner, Brendan Fraser, Terrence Howard, Chris \"Ludacris\" Bridges, Thandiwe Newton, Michael Peña, Larenz Tate and Ryan Phillippe.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWriter and director Paul Haggis was inspired to make the film after being carjacked by two African-American men at a Blockbuster Video on Wilshire Boulevard while driving home from the premiere of *The Silence of the Lambs* in February 1991.[4][5] Afterwards he began thinking more about the impact of race, ethnicity, and class in American society.[6][7] He later stated that he wrote *Crash* not simply to criticize racists but to \"bust liberals\" for the idea that the United States had become a post-racial society.[8] Haggis cowrote the first draft of *Crash* with Robert Moresco in 2001 after being fired from *Family Law*.[9][4]\n\n\n\n### Casting[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n81. **^** Carpenter, John (September 6, 2005). \"Crash\". *DVD Review & High Definition*.
