She is a young student from Jujutsu High, mentored by Satoru Gojo. While working on missions involving Curses, Maki mentors the newcomer Yuta Okkotsu who is trying to control the undead Rika which is attacking innocent people. The manga mentions Maki's origins as a reject from the Zen'in clan which is further explored in the sequel *Jujutsu Kaisen* where she is one year older and deals with several enemies.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn *Jujutsu Kaisen*, Maki appears one year older still as Sorcerer from Jujutsu High alongside Panda and Toge Inumaki as Yuta is working abroad. During an examination where the Kyoto students try to kill newcomer Yuji Itadori for possessing the vengeful spirit of Ryoma Sukuna, Maki joins Yuji's group and defeats her sister Mai who questions why she left their clan. During the Shibuya incident, Maki suffers several major wounds and loses an eye. After the incident, Maki still continues to fight alongside Yuta and the other Jujutsu High students against Geto's predecessor Kenjaku. After Mai sacrifices her life for Maki, she is able to see curses without glasses. After killing their father, she slaughters all members of the Zen'in clan in retribution for the pain she and Mai were forced to undergo during their childhood.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMaki Zen'in debuts in *Jujutsu Kaisen 0* as a young student from Jujutsu High mentored by Satoru Gojo who brings a nervous teenager, Yuta Okkotsu, in order to train him and stop the curse of the undead girl Rika who is attacking everybody chasing Yuta. Early Maki mocks Yuta's weakness for being too passive, believing him to be the often subject of bullying. Although Yuta is unable to fight, he is assigned to work with Maki in exorcising a curse. When Maki is wounded, she asks Yuta what is his real desire to which he responds is that he only wants to enjoy a good life rather than remain alone. Maki encourages him to fight for such rights which allows her partner to control Rika for a brief period of time to escape with her.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Akutami, Gege (2019). *Jujutsu Kaisen*.

Her hair's length is something Akutami tends to change whenever he likes. Akutami also enjoys writing how Maki is shown to particularly strong physically in early in the series due to how she destroys a weapon using brute force.[1] Akutami enjoyed writing a scene in which Yuta comforts Maki Zen'in in the third chapter, which causes Maki to leave and blush angrily about whether or not should feel accepted by him. Upon seeing this scene, Akutami's editor Katayama said Yuta really understood Maki's feelings. Akutami decided to revise this scene in the storyboard following his editor's praise.[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAkutami created Maki as a character whose origins would be further explored in the series future with her fighting style being a mix of several ones envisioned in one. She is voiced by Mikako Komatsu in Japanese and Allegra Clark in English. Critical response to Maki's character has been positive in both *Jujutsu Kaisen* and the prequel for her striking personality and fighting skills, with the latter often noted to be strange to see in series aimed towards a male demography.\n\n\n\n\n## Creation[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMikako Komatsu voices Maki who noted the dynamic between her character, Panda and Toge Inumaki provided interesting comedy in both the television series and the movie prequel with Maki often being loud. Originally she was grown up and had an aggressive part, but was conscious that this work feels younger and more momentum in the reaction to what was said and what happened than in the TV series. Komatsu felt that the movie helped to explore her character's weakness, especially when she bonds with the shy Yuta Okkotsu as a result of their similarities as a result of his weak personality. Maki sees her strength in being able to express her feelings honestly in her weakness, and she feels frustrated in him, and she hits hard. Komatsu finds that Maki becomes more likable when interacting with Yuta despite her initial comments about how she perceives the young man. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBoth the original mini-series and the main *Jujutsu Kaisen* manga early explore issues Maki has with other members from Zen'in clan to the point her weaponry is surprising but is related to the mentor Satoru Gojo. Akutami claimed in the thirteen volume that he planned to explore more focus more on the Zen'in clan problems.[3] Her design went from normal glasses to black-frames in the sequel but only for the fight against Suguru Geto. When asked by why Maki often refers to Todo by his surname, Akutami mentioned it is a tendency of her to call others by their first name unless the others call her by her last name. As a result, he mentions any contradictions when dealing with others might come across as plot holes. Originally, Maki uses a weapon to compensate for her lack of spells. Akutami claimed in the series' fanbook that a major theme in the manga is Maki becoming a stronger Jujutsu sorcerer which is meant to be the focus on future installments. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThere was also commentary about Maki's role in *Jujutsu Kaisen 0*. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAllegra Clark voices Maki in the English dub who sees her character's most notable traits are both \"vulnerable\" and \"angry\". However, Clark claims that thanks to the handling of these, Maki is enjoyable to play especially with her goals. She noticed about a major contrast between the television series and the movie in regards to how she tells Nobara and Yuta, respectively, what is her desire; In the television series she wants to become a stronger sorcerer while in the movie she instead more angry-driven towards her clan to the point of wanting to take them down. The rage that she felt in the film where she was younger, she is still finding acceptance, and but is not as mature as in the television series. Across the movie, she goes through a personal character arc where she grows more confidence. Satisfied with her role in the movie, Clark made research into the manga and wanted to keep playing Maki due to her further screentime that the anime has yet to explore.[5]\n\n\n\n## Appearances[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Although having an appearance of a giant panda, he is actually a unique type of Cursed Corpse created by Masamichi Yaga, in which not only does Panda have sentience, but grows and matures as he ages. Also unique to him is having three \"cores\" (the 'heart' of a Cursed Corpse), which he can change back and forth to unlock various abilities. After grieving the death of his creator, Masamichi Yaga, Panda joins the Culling Games with Itadori and Fushiguro in the effort to stop it. Panda engages in a battle with Hajime Kashimo, a resurrected sorcerer from the Heian era, who manages to defeat all two of his cores. Only the interference of Kinji Hakari stops Kashimo from killing Panda.\n\n\n\n#### Yuta Okkotsu[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Yuta Okkotsu\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n47. **^** Dodge, Lucien [@LucienDodge] (January 8, 2021). \"I play Mahito in Jujutsu Kaisen.
