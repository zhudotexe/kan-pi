It is the capital and largest city of the autonomous community of Catalonia, as well as the second-most populous municipality of Spain. With a population of 1.6 million within city limits,[7] its urban area extends to numerous neighbouring municipalities within the province of Barcelona and is home to around 4.8 million people,[3] making it the fifth most populous urban area in the European Union after Paris, the Ruhr area, Madrid and Milan.[3] It is one of the largest metropolises on the Mediterranean Sea, located on the coast between the mouths of the rivers Llobregat and Besòs, bounded to the west by the Serra de Collserola mountain range.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBarcelona was the 24th most \"livable city\" in the world in 2015 according to lifestyle magazine *Monocle*.[96] Similarly, according to Innovation Analysts 2thinknow, Barcelona occupies 13th place in the world on *Innovation Cities™ Global Index*.[97] At the same time it is according to the Global Wealth and Lifestyle Report 2020 one of the most affordable cities in the world for a luxury lifestyle.[98]\n\n\nBarcelona has a long-standing mercantile tradition. Less well known is that the city industrialised early, taking off in 1833, when Catalonia's already sophisticated textile industry began to use steam power. It became the first and most important industrial city in the Mediterranean basin. Since then, manufacturing has played a large role in its history.\n\n\nBorsa de Barcelona (Barcelona Stock Exchange) is the main stock exchange in the northeastern part of the Iberian Peninsula.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2016, about 59% of the inhabitants of the city were born in Catalonia and 18.5% coming from the rest of the country. In addition to that, 22.5% of the population was born outside of Spain, a proportion which has more than doubled since 2001 and more than quintupled since 1996 when it was 8.6% respectively 3.9%.[75]\n\n\nThe most important region of origin of migrants is Europe, with many coming from Italy (26,676) or France (13,506).[75] Moreover, many migrants come from Latin American nations such as Bolivia, Ecuador or Colombia. Since the 1990s, and similar to other migrants, many Latin Americans have settled in northern parts of the city.[83]\n\n\nThere exists a relatively large Pakistani community in Barcelona with up to twenty thousand nationals. The community consists of significantly more men than women. Many of the Pakistanis are living in Ciutat Vella. First Pakistani migrants came in the 1970s, with increasing numbers in the 1990s.[84]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n89. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Estudio demográfico de la población musulmana\" (PDF).

The increased cost of housing has led to a slight decline (−16.6%) in the population over the last two decades of the 20th century as many families move out into the suburbs. This decline has been reversed since 2001, as a new wave of immigration (particularly from Latin America and from Morocco) has gathered pace.[59]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe result was a large-scale immigration from poorer regions of Spain (particularly Andalusia, Murcia and Galicia), which in turn led to rapid urbanisation.\n\n\n\n### Late twentieth century[edit]\n\n\nIn 1992, Barcelona hosted the Summer Olympics. The after-effects of this are credited with driving major changes in what had, up until then, been a largely industrial city. As part of the preparation for the games, industrial buildings along the sea-front were demolished and 3 km (2 mi) of beach were created. New construction increased the road capacity of the city by 17%, the sewage handling capacity by 27% and the amount of new green areas and beaches by 78%. Between 1990 and 2004, the number of hotel rooms in the city doubled. Perhaps more importantly, the outside perception of the city was changed making, by 2012, Barcelona the 12th most popular city destination in the world and the 5th amongst European cities.[50][51][52][53][54]\n\n\n\n### Recent history[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_itEZdvMmUT5wqYZG8QTMG53M","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

Eurostat places Paris (6.5 million people) behind London (8 million) and ahead of Berlin (3.5 million), based on the 2012 populations of what Eurostat calls \"urban audit core cities\".[157]\nThe population of Paris today is lower than its historical peak of 2.9 million in 1921.[158] The principal reasons were a significant decline in household size, and a dramatic migration of residents to the suburbs between 1962 and 1975. Factors in the migration included de-industrialisation, high rent, the gentrification of many inner quarters, the transformation of living space into offices, and greater affluence among working families. The city's population loss came to a temporary halt at the beginning of the 21st century; the population increased from 2,125,246 in 1999 to 2,240,621 in 2012, before declining again slightly in 2017, 2018, and again in 2021.[159][160]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe city also hosted the finals of the 1938 FIFA World Cup (at the Stade Olympique de Colombes), as well as the 1998 FIFA World Cup and the 2007 Rugby World Cup Final (both at the Stade de France).

The Hurricanes compete in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), while the Panthers compete in the Conference USA of the National Collegiate Athletic Association.[179][180]\n\n\nMiami is also home to Paso Fino horses, and competitions are held at Tropical Park Equestrian Center.[181]\n\n\nMiami will serve as one of eleven U.S. host cities for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.[182]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nMiami metropolitan area\n |\n| --- |\n| Population: **6,012,331** (2015)\n |\n| Counties | * Miami-Dade\n* Broward\n* Palm Beach\n |\n| Major city441k | * Miami\n |\n| Cities and towns100k–250k | * Coral Springs\n* Fort Lauderdale\n* Hialeah\n* Hollywood\n* Miami Gardens\n* Miramar\n* Pembroke Pines\n* Pompano Beach\n* West Palm Beach\n |\n| Cities and towns25k–99k | * Aventura\n* Boca Raton\n* Boynton Beach\n* Coconut Creek\n* Cooper City\n* Coral Gables\n* Cutler Bay\n* Dania Beach\n* Davie\n* Deerfield Beach\n* Delray Beach\n* Doral\n* Greenacres\n* Hallandale Beach\n* Homestead\n* Jupiter\n* Lake Worth\n* Lauderdale Lakes\n* Lauderhill\n* Margate\n* Miami Beach\n* North Lauderdale\n* North Miami\n* North Miami Beach\n* Oakland Park\n* Palm Beach Gardens\n* Plantation\n* Riviera Beach\n* Sunrise\n* Tamarac\n* West Park\n* Weston\n* Wilton Manors\n |\n| Cities and towns10k–25k | * Belle Glade\n* Hialeah Gardens\n* Lighthouse Point\n* Miami Lakes\n* Miami Springs\n* Opa-locka\n* Palm Beach\n* Parkland\n* South Miami\n* Sunny Isles Beach\n* Sweetwater\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMiami is the largest city in South Florida, the second-largest city in Florida, and is the anchor of the largest metropolitan area in Florida: the Miami metropolitan area, which has over 6 million residents. Despite the city being home to less than a fourteenth (1/14) of the population of the metro area, it is an outlier compared to its neighbors, being nearly twice the size of the next-largest city in the metro: Hialeah. The city also has approximately a sixth of the population of its own county, Miami-Dade, which is the state's largest.\n\n\nThe city witnessed rapid growth over the first half of the twentieth century, as its population grew from 1,681 at the time of the 1900 census to 249,276 at the time of the 1950 census. This made it Florida's largest city, a title it would retain until the Jacksonville Consolidation, when the city of Jacksonville absorbed most of Duval County, nearly tripling its population. Since then, Miami has retained its spot as Florida's second-largest city.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Miami** (/maɪˈæmi/ *my-AM-ee*), officially the **City of Miami**, is a coastal metropolis and the seat of Miami-Dade County in South Florida. With a population of 442,241 as of the 2020 census,[6] it is the second-most populous city in the state of Florida after Jacksonville. It is the core of the much larger Miami metropolitan area, which, with a population of 6.14 million, is the second-largest metropolitan region in the Southeast and ninth-largest metropolitan region in the United States.[9] Miami has the third-largest skyline in the U.S. with over 300 high-rises,[13] 58 of which exceed 491 ft (150 m).[14]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_0cW39yXShFWMd6MmLya4GxmD","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
