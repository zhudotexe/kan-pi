The *Post*'s 1971 printing of the Pentagon Papers helped spur opposition to the Vietnam War.

Reporters Charles Dow, Edward Jones, and Charles Bergstresser converted this into *The Wall Street Journal*, which was published for the first time on July 8, 1889, and began delivery of the Dow Jones & Company News Service via telegraph.[15]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Wall Street Journal| Trust Your Decisions |\n| ![](image) |\n| Type | Daily newspaper |\n| Format | Broadsheet |\n| Owner(s) | News Corp (via Dow Jones & Company) |\n| Founder(s) | * Charles Dow\n* Edward Jones\n* Charles Bergstresser\n |\n| Publisher | Almar Latour |\n| Editor-in-chief | Emma Tucker |\n| Deputy editor | Charles Forelle |\n| Managing editor | Liz Harris |\n| Opinion editor | Paul A.

In 1921, *Barron's*, the United States's premier financial weekly, was founded.[16] Barron died in 1928, a year before Black Tuesday, the stock market crash that greatly affected the Great Depression in the United States.

It was first printed at the *Mirror* printing plant, owned by Jesse Yarnell and T. J. Caystile. Unable to pay the printing bill, Cole and Gardiner turned the paper over to the Mirror Company. In the meantime, S. J. Mathes had joined the firm, and it was at his insistence that the *Times* continued publication. In July 1882, Harrison Gray Otis moved from Santa Barbara, California to become the paper's editor.[10] Otis made the *Times* a financial success.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1935, the newspaper moved to a new, landmark Art Deco building, the Los Angeles Times Building, to which the newspaper would add other facilities until taking up the entire city block between Spring, Broadway, First and Second streets, which came to be known as Times Mirror Square and would house the paper until 2018.

The combined paper, the *Mirror-News*, ceased publication in 1962, when the Hearst afternoon *Herald-Express* and the morning *Los Angeles Examiner* merged to become the *Herald-Examiner*.[91] The *Herald-Examiner* published its last number in 1989. In 2014, the *Los Angeles Register*, published by Freedom Communications, then-parent company of the *Orange County Register* was launched as a daily newspaper to compete with the *Times*.
