He scored Argentina's opening goal with a penalty, becoming in the process the first player since the last-16 round was introduced in 1986 to score a goal in every round of a single World Cup edition.[520][521] After Argentina's eventual two-goal lead was erased by France forward Kylian Mbappé, who scored twice inside two minutes, Messi would score again in extra-time to restore Argentina's lead, before Mbappé again drew France level. Tied 3–3 after extra-time, the match went to a penalty shoot-out. Messi scored Argentina's first goal in the shoot-out, with Argentina eventually winning 4–2, ending the nation's 36-year wait for the trophy.[522] Messi received the Golden Ball for player of the tournament, becoming the first player to win it twice. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n516. **^** Hytner, David (13 December 2022). \"Inspired Lionel Messi takes Argentina past Croatia and into World Cup final\". *The Guardian*.
