The Warriors became the 7th NBA franchise to win back-to-back championships, joining the Los Angeles Lakers, Boston Celtics, Detroit Pistons, Chicago Bulls, Houston Rockets, and Miami Heat. This year's Finals was the first time in any of North America's four major professional sports leagues that the same two teams met for the championship four years in a row.[1] This was also the first time that a team was swept in the NBA Finals since 2007, in which the Cavaliers were also the losing team. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n2018 edition of the NBA Finals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2018 NBA Finals| ![](image) |\n| \n\n| Team | Coach | Wins |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Golden State Warriors | Steve Kerr | 4 |\n| Cleveland Cavaliers | Tyronn Lue | 0 |\n\n |\n| Dates | May 31 – June 8 |\n| MVP | Kevin Durant(Golden State Warriors) |\n| Eastern finals | Cavaliers defeated Celtics, 4–3 |\n| Western finals | Warriors defeated Rockets, 4–3 |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ← 2017 | **NBA Finals** | 2019 → |\n\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn February 8, 2018 – just before the NBA trade deadline – the Cavaliers radically changed their roster in a little more than an hour,[10][11] acquiring George Hill, Rodney Hood, Jordan Clarkson, and Larry Nance Jr. in exchange for Thomas, Rose, Crowder, Wade, Channing Frye, Iman Shumpert, and their own 2018 first-round pick.

They were both making their third Finals appearance. Phoenix and Milwaukee each began play as expansion teams in 1968. Both teams were involved in a coin toss for the rights to the first overall pick in the 1969 NBA draft, which the Bucks won and used to select Lew Alcindor, later known as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, from UCLA. He led the Bucks to their first championship in 1971.[6] The 2021 Finals was the first since 1971 to not include any players who had previously won an NBA championship, and the first since 2015 that no players on the winning team had prior NBA Finals experience. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nNBA Finals\n |\n| --- |\n| * Champions\n\t+ Teams\n\t+ Players\n\t+ Coaches\n* Most Valuable Player Award\n* Brown Trophy\n* O'Brien Trophy\n* Championship ring\n* Broadcasters\n* Game sevens\n* Droughts\n* Streaks\n* TV ratings\n |\n| 1940s | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  | 1947 | 1948 | 1949 |\n | ![](image)\n |\n| 1950s | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1950 | 1951 | 1952 | 1953 | 1954 | 1955 | 1956 | 1957 | 1958 | 1959 |\n |\n| 1960s | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1960 | 1961 | 1962 | 1963 | 1964 | 1965 | 1966 | 1967 | 1968 | 1969 |\n |\n| 1970s | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1970 | 1971 | 1972 | 1973 | 1974 | 1975 | 1976 | 1977 | 1978 | 1979 |\n |\n| 1980s | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_OHBi4GuXkePRi2gK2hxmRYJX","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

The Finals marked the conclusion of the NBA Bubble, which recorded no COVID-19 cases for the participating teams.[12] The 2020 Finals was the latest to begin (beating the 1999 edition which began on June 16) and the first one played in September and October, and as well held in the fall.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\n### Season suspension and restart[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Suspension of the 2019–20 NBA season and 2020 NBA Bubble\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn March 11, 2020, the NBA announced the suspension of the 2019–20 season following a report that Utah Jazz All-Star center Rudy Gobert tested positive for COVID-19 just hours before the Jazz road game against the Oklahoma City Thunder.[13] On June 4, the NBA Board of Governors approved 29–1 (the Portland Trail Blazers were the lone dissenter) resuming the 2019–20 season at Walt Disney World. The National Basketball Players Association approved the plan a day later.[11] Under the plan, thirteen Western Conference teams and nine Eastern Conference teams, which include all clubs within six games of a playoff spot, played eight regular-season \"seeding\" games. A possible play-in tournament for the eighth seed in each conference would then be held if the ninth seed finished the regular season within four games of the eighth seed (this play-in tournament was used in the Western conference only). The 2020 NBA playoffs were then played as a conventional post-season tournament.[10]\n\n\n\n### Miami Heat[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Atlantic | * Boston\n* Brooklyn\n* New York\n* Philadelphia\n* Toronto\n |\n| Central | * Chicago\n* Cleveland\n* Detroit\n* Indiana\n* Milwaukee\n |\n| Southeast | * Atlanta\n* Charlotte\n* *Miami*\n* Orlando\n* Washington\n |\n\n |\n| Western | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Northwest | * Denver\n* Minnesota\n* Oklahoma City\n* Portland\n* Utah\n |\n| Pacific | * Golden State\n* L.A.

Sponsored by the streaming service YouTube TV, the series was officially known as the **2022 NBA Finals presented by YouTube TV**.[6] This edition of the Finals was a rematch of the 1964 NBA Finals, in which the Celtics defeated the then-San Francisco Warriors in five games.[7]\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\n### Boston Celtics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2021–22 Boston Celtics season\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* **z** – Clinched home court advantage for the entire playoffs\n* **c** – Clinched home court advantage for the conference playoffs\n* **y** – Clinched division title\n* **x** – Clinched playoff spot\n* **pi** – Clinched play-in tournament spot\n* **\\*** – Division leader\n\n\n\n\nPlayoff results\n| Boston Celtics (Eastern Conference champion) |  | Golden State Warriors (Western Conference champion)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Defeated the 7th seeded Brooklyn Nets, 4–0 | First round\n | Defeated the 6th seeded Denver Nuggets, 4–1 |\n| Defeated the 3rd seeded Milwaukee Bucks, 4–3 | Conference Semifinals\n | Defeated the 2nd seeded Memphis Grizzlies, 4–2 |\n| Defeated the 1st seeded Miami Heat, 4–3 | Conference Finals\n | Defeated the 4th seeded Dallas Mavericks, 4–1 |\n\n\n### Regular season series[edit]\n\n\nThe Warriors and Celtics tied the regular season series 1–1, with the away team winning each game.\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| December 17, 2021\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Recap\n |\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe NBA then announced on May 12 that the Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy and the Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Trophy have also been redesigned. Among the new changes to the Larry O'Brien Trophy, its base now consists of two disks that list the names of all the previous winning teams. The Bill Russell Trophy has been changed from a gold ball and silver net to primarily gold with silver accents.[70]\n\n\nWith NBA commissioner Adam Silver missing games 5 and 6 due to the league's health and safety protocols, the Larry O'Brien Trophy was presented to the Warriors by deputy commissioner Mark Tatum instead.[71]\n\n\n\n## Media coverage[edit]\n\n\nThe Finals was televised in the United States by ABC for the 20th consecutive year.[72]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the first round of the playoffs, the Celtics won in a four-game sweep over the seventh-seeded Brooklyn Nets, with numerous experts expecting a more competitive series as the Nets, with Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving and initially James Harden before he was traded to the Philadelphia 76ers, were seen as the preseason favorites.[11] The Celtics then faced the 2021 Finals MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo and defending champion Milwaukee Bucks, going down 3–2 in the series before eventually winning the series in seven games. After going down 2–1 in the conference finals against the first-seeded Miami Heat led by Jimmy Butler, the Celtics won in seven games, reaching the Finals for the first time since 2010 and for the 22nd time in their history.[12]\n\n\nThis marked the first time a team from the Greater Boston area reached a championship series of the four major North American sports leagues since 2019, when the Boston Bruins reached the Stanley Cup Finals.\n\n\n\n### Golden State Warriors[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n7. **^** Jenkins, Bruce (June 4, 2022). \"Chamberlain vs. Russell, Warriors-Celtics NBA Finals of '64 remains all-time epic meeting\". *San Francisco Chronicle*.
