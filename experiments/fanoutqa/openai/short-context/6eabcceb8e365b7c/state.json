The league's dominant team during this period was the Tokyo Kyojin, which won nine league championships, including six in a row from 1938 to 1943. (The team was officially renamed the Yomiuri Giants in 1947.)\n\n\n\n### NPB establishment[edit]\n\n\nAfter the 1949 season, the JBL team owners reorganized into the NPB; Daiei Stars owner Masaichi Nagata promoted a two-league system, which became the Pacific League (initially called the **Taiheiyo Baseball Union**) and the Central League. (Nagata became the first president of the Pacific League.)[11] The league now known as Nippon Pro Baseball began play in the 1950 season.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNippon Professional Baseball| **Current season, competition or edition:**![Current sports event](image) *2023 Nippon Professional Baseball season* |\n| ![](image)Nippon Professional Baseball\u65e5\u672c\u91ce\u7403\u6a5f\u69cb\n |\n| Formerly | Japanese Baseball League (JPBL) |\n| Sport | Baseball |\n| Founded | JPBL, February\u00a05, 1936; 88 years ago\u00a0(1936-02-05)Pacific League, November\u00a026, 1949; 74 years ago\u00a0(1949-11-26)[1]Central League, December\u00a015, 1949; 74 years ago\u00a0(1949-12-15)[2] |\n| Commissioner | Sadayuki Sakakibara |\n| No. of teams | 12 |\n| Country | Japan |\n| Headquarters | 5\u201336\u20137 Shiba, Minato-ku, Tokyo |\n| Most recentchampion(s) | Hanshin Tigers(2nd title) |\n| Most titles | Yomiuri Giants(22 titles) |\n| Qualification | Asia Series (2005\u20132013) |\n| TV partner(s) | * **Japan**:\n* *Broadcast*\n* Fuji TV / NHK\n* TV Asahi / J Sports / TBS\n* Gaora Sports\u00a0[ja]\n* Sports Live+\u00a0[ja]\n* *Live streaming*\n* DAZN\n* **United States**:\n* *Post-game Streaming*\n* For the Fans (Pacific League)\n* **International**:\n* *Live streaming*\n* Pacific League TV\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Comparison of Major League Baseball and Nippon Professional Baseball\n* High school baseball in Japan\n* Japanese Baseball Hall of Fame\n* List of Japanese baseball players\n* List of Japanese players in Major League Baseball\n* Shikoku Island League Plus (Regional professional league)\n* List of Nippon Professional Baseball mascots\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNippon Professional Baseball consists of two leagues, the Central League and the Pacific League, which each have six teams. There are also two secondary-level professional minor leagues, the Eastern League and the Western League, that play shorter schedules for developing players. NPB teams are allowed to have more than one minor league team as long as they are outside of the established minor league system, with the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks and Yomiuri Giants being the only teams taking advantage of this. As of 2023, the Hawks have three minor league teams,[3] the Giants have two, and the other ten teams only have one minor league team each. Teams below the Eastern and Western Leagues play exhibition matches against various teams of collegiate, industrial, Shikoku Island League Plus, and other NPB minor league statuses.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Defunct Clubs |\n| --- |\n| Team\n | City\n | Stadium\n | Founded\n | Ceased Operations\n | Notes\n |\n| **Nishi Nippon Pirates** | Fukuoka, Fukuoka | 52 stadiums in 29 prefectures across Japan[36] | 1950\n | January 30, 1951[37] | Merged with the Nishitetsu Clippers to form the Fukuoka Nishitetsu Lions (now known as the Saitama Seibu Lions)\n |\n| **Shochiku Robins** | Kyoto, Kyoto | Kinugasa Stadium | 1936\n | January 1, 1953[38] | Merged with the Taiyo Whales to form the Taiyo-Shochiku Robins (now known as the Yokohama DeNA BayStars)\n |\n| **Takahashi Unions** | Kawasaki, Kanagawa | Kawasaki Stadium | 1954\n | February 25, 1957[39] | Merged with the Daiei Stars to form the Daiei Unions |\n| **Daiei Unions** | Bunky\u014d, Tokyo | Korakuen Stadium | 1946\n | November 24, 1957[40] | Merged with the Mainichi Orions to form the Daimai Orions (now known as the Chiba Lotte Marines)\n |\n| **Osaka Kintetsu Buffaloes** | Osaka, Osaka | Kyocera Dome Osaka | 1949\n | December 1, 2004\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Locality\n | 1950\n | 1951\u20131952\n | 1953\n | 1954\n | 1955\u20131956\n | 1957\n | 1958\u20131972\n | 1973\u20131977\n | 1978\n | 1979\u20131988\n | 1989\u20132003\n | 2004\n | 2005\u20132022\n | 2023-present\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Sapporo |  | Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters (PL), 2004\u20132022\n |\n| Kitahiroshima |  | Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters (PL), 2023\u2013present\n |\n| Sendai |  | Lotte Orions (PL), 1973\u20131977\n |  | Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles (PL), 2005\u2013present\n |\n| Greater Tokyo | Kokutetsu Swallows / Sankei Atoms / Yakult Swallows (CL), 1950\u2013present\n |\n| Yomiuri Giants (CL), 1950\u2013present\n |\n| Toei Flyers / Nippon-Ham Fighters (PL), 1950\u20132003\n |\n| Mainichi/Daimai/Tokyo/Lotte Orions (PL), 1950\u20131972\n |  | Lotte Orions / Chiba Lotte Marines (PL), 1978\u2013present\n |\n|  | Takahashi Unions (PL), 1954\u20131956\n | Daiei Unions (PL), 1957\n |  | Saitama Seibu Lions (PL), 1979\u2013present\n |\n| Daiei Stars (PL), 1950\u20131956\n |\n|  | Taiyo Whales / Yokohama BayStars (CL), 1955\u2013present\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nNippon Professional Baseball\n |\n| --- |\n| 2024 season\n |\n| Central League | * Chunichi Dragons\n* Hanshin Tigers\n* Hiroshima Toyo Carp\n* Tokyo Yakult Swallows\n* Yokohama DeNA BayStars\n* Yomiuri Giants\n |\n| Pacific League | * Chiba Lotte Marines\n* Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks\n* Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters\n* Orix Buffaloes\n* Saitama Seibu Lions\n* Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles\n |\n| Schedule | * All-Star Series\n* Interleague play\n* Seasons\n* World Baseball Classic\n |\n| Postseason | * Climax Series\n* Japan Series\n |\n| Awards | * Eiji Sawamura Award\n* Most Valuable Player\n* Comeback Player of the Year\n* Rookie of the Year\n* Japan Series Most Valuable Player Award\n* Best Nine Award\n* Golden Spirit Award\n* Matsutaro Shoriki Award\n* Hall of Fame\n |\n| Miscellaneous | * Commissioner\n* Players\n* Foreign players\n\t+ Americans\n* Rosters\n* Stadiums\n* Comparison with Major League Baseball\n* Minor leagues\n\t+ Western League\n\t+ Eastern League\n* Japanese Baseball League\n |\n| * Professional baseball in Japan\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFour JBL teams formed the basis of the Central League: the Chunichi Dragons, the Hanshin Tigers, the Yomiuri Giants, and the Shochiku Robins (formerly the Taiy\u014d Robins).

To fill out the league, three new teams were formed: the Kintetsu Pearls, the Mainichi Orions, and the Nishitetsu Clippers.\n\n\nMatsutar\u014d Sh\u014driki, the Giants' owner, acted as NPB's unofficial commissioner and oversaw the first Japan Series, which featured the Mainichi Orions defeating the Shochiku Robins 4 games to 2.\n\n\n\n### Expansion and contraction[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nUntil 1993, baseball was the only team sport played professionally in Japan. In that year, the J.League professional football league was founded. The new football league placed teams in prefectural capitals around the country\u2014rather than clustering them in and around Tokyo\u2014and the teams were named after their locations rather than after corporate sponsors, despite many clubs in the J.League still being owned and subsidized by corporate entities.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nNippon Professional Baseball seasons\n |\n| --- |\n| 1930s\u20131940s (Japanese Baseball League) | * 1936\n* 1937\n* 1938\n* 1939\n* 1940\n* 1941\n* 1942\n* 1943\n* 1944\n* 1945\n* 1946\n* 1947\n* 1948\n* 1949\n |\n| 1950s\u20131960s | * 1950\n* 1951\n* 1952\n* 1953\n* 1954\n* 1955\n* 1956\n* 1957\n* 1958\n* 1959\n* 1960\n* 1961\n* 1962\n* 1963\n* 1964\n* 1965\n* 1966\n* 1967\n* 1968\n* 1969\n |\n| 1970s\u20131980s | * 1970\n* 1971\n* 1972\n* 1973\n* 1974\n* 1975\n* 1976\n* 1977\n* 1978\n* 1979\n* 1980\n* 1981\n* 1982\n* 1983\n* 1984\n* 1985\n* 1986\n* 1987\n* 1988\n* 1989\n |\n| 1990s\u20132000s | * 1990\n* 1991\n* 1992\n* 1993\n* 1994\n* 1995\n* 1996\n* 1997\n* 1998\n* 1999\n* 2000\n* 2001\n* 2002\n* 2003\n* 2004\n* 2005\n* 2006\n* 2007\n* 2008\n* 2009\n |\n| 2010s\u20132020s | * 2010\n* 2011\n* 2012\n* 2013\n* 2014\n* 2015\n* 2016\n* 2017\n* 2018\n* 2019\n* 2020\n* 2021\n* 2022\n* 2023\n* 2024\n |\n| * Japan Series\n* Climax Series\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

A former mascot of the team, Cool-kun, who was a penguin, was Mar-kun's friend and rival. He was retired by the team in 2016.[4] |\n| Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks | Hawk Family\n | The SoftBank Hawks have the most mascots of any NPB team, with 11, 9 of which being part of the Hawk Family. These mascots are Harry Hawk, the main mascot, Honey Hawk, his girlfriend (formerly a huge fan of him when Daiei owned the team) and the namesake of Honeys, the club's cheerleading squad, Herculy Hawk, his longstanding rival, Honky Hawk, his uncle, Helen Hawk, Honkey's wife, Hack, Rick and Hock Hawk, his nephews, and Homer Hawk, his older brother and the former main mascot when the club was owned by Daiei.[5] |\n| Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters | Frep the Fox, Polly Polaris, Brisky the Bear, Cubby the Bear\n | An anthropomorphic Ezo red fox, brown squirrel, and black and brown bear. Frep was introduced in 2016, initially as an apprentice to Brisky, then became main in 2018. Polly was introduced in 2012, as the team's first female mascot, and also being childhood friends with Brisky. Cubby was introduced in 2006 as Brisky's younger brother, and Brisky was introduced in 2004, when the club moved to Hokkaido.[6] |\n| Orix Buffaloes | Buffalo Bull and Buffalo Bell\n | Two anthropomorphic buffaloes, with Buffalo Bull being the main mascot, and Buffalo Bell being his sister. They were both introduced in 2011.[7] |\n| Saitama Seibu Lions | Leo and Lina\n | Two anthropomorphic white lions, based on Kimba the White Lion, although series creator Osamu Tezuka said Leo was based on Caesar (or Panja as he is known in Japan).\n |\n| Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles | Clutch, Clutchyna, Switch\n | Clutch and Clutchyna are both anthropomorphic golden eagles, whilst Switch is an anthropomorphic harpy eagle from California.[8] |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Central League** |\n| Team\n | Mascot(s)\n | Description\n |\n| Chunichi Dragons | Doala, Shaolon, Paolon\n | An anthropomorphic blue koala, and 2 dragons. Doala is the main mascot, and Shalon appears on the logo. Doala is a koala because Nagoya is home to Japan's first koala. He is also friends with Tsubakuro, the mascot of the Tokyo Yakult Swallows.[9] |\n| Hanshin Tigers | To-Lucky, Lucky, Keeta\n | Three anthropomorphic tigers, with To-Lucky being the main mascot, introduced in 1985, Lucky, his girlfriend, and Keeta, Lucky's younger brother.\n |\n| Hiroshima Toyo Carp | Slyly\n | He is based on the Phillie Phanatic, and was also designed by Harrison/Erickson.

Tsubakuro is the main mascot, Tsubami is his younger sister, and Torukuya is his younger brother. As aforementioned, Tsubakuro is friends with Doala. His number is 2896, because if one were to pronounce it in Japanese, it would spell out his name.\n |\n| Yokohama DeNA BayStars | DB. Starman and DB. Kirara\n | Two anthropomorphic hamsters. Both of them were introduced in 2011, when DeNA bought the club.\n |\n| Yomiuri Giants | Giabbits\n | Consisting of 6 rabbits, as the Giants' cap logo would look like a rabbit.
