With the switch to the Michael Jordan Trophy, his name was moved to a new Maurice Podoloff Trophy given to the team with the best regular season record.[4] Until the 1979\u201380\u00a0season, the MVP was selected by a vote of NBA players. Since the 1980\u201381\u00a0season, the award is decided by a panel of sportswriters and broadcasters throughout the United States and Canada.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nEach member of the voting panel casts a vote for first to fifth place selections. Each first-place vote is worth 10 points; each second-place vote is worth seven; each third-place vote is worth five, fourth-place is worth three and fifth-place is worth one. Starting from 2010, one ballot was cast by fans through online voting. The player with the highest point total wins the award.[5] As of the 2022\u201323\u00a0season, the current holder of the award is Joel Embiid of the Philadelphia 76ers.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n8. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Wallace, Michael (May 5, 2013). \"LeBron James wins 4th MVP award\". *ESPN.com*.
