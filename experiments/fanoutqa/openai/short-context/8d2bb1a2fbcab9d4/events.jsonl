For the first time, Jeff Bezos was listed as the top billionaire due to Amazon's rising stock price that resulted in one person's biggest one-year gain in wealth ($35 billion) since *Forbes* started tracking in 1987.[15] The U.S. had the most billionaires in the world, with 585, while China was catching up with 476 when including Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan; it had 372 when excluding those three places.[15] Forbes excluded Al-Walid bin Talal and all other Saudi billionaires due to the absence of accurate wealth estimations as a result of the 2017–19 Saudi Arabian purge.[16]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn the 30th anniversary of the *Forbes* list of the world's billionaires, for the fourth year in a row, Bill Gates was named the richest man in the world.[5] In 2017, there was a record of 2,043 people on the list, which is the first time over 2,000 people were listed. This included 195 newcomers of whom 76 were from China and 25 from the U.S.; there were 56 people under 40 and it had a record of 227 women.[17] The number of billionaires increased 13% to 2,043 from 1,810 in 2016; this was the biggest change in over 30 years of tracking billionaires globally.[5] Added together, the total net worth for 2017's billionaires was US$7.67 trillion, up from US$7.1 trillion in 2015.[5][18] This was the first time after 12 years that Carlos Slim was not within the top five. The U.S. had the most billionaires in the world, with a record of 565. China had 319 (not including Hong Kong, Taiwan or Macau), Germany had 114, and India had the fourth most with 101; India reached over 100 billionaires for its first time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| People | * *Forbes* list of billionaires\n* List of centibillionaires\n* Female billionaires\n* Richest royals\n* Wealthiest Americans\n* Wealthiest families\n |\n| Organizations | * Largest companies by revenue\n* Largest corporate profits and losses\n* Largest corporations by market capitalization\n* Largest financial services companies by revenue\n* Largest manufacturing companies by revenue\n* Largest software companies by revenue\n* Largest technology companies by revenue\n* Charities\n\t+ Philanthropists\n* Universities\n\t+ Endowment size\n\t+ Number of billionaire alumni\n |\n| Other | * Cities by number of billionaires\n* Countries by number of billionaires\n* Countries by total wealth\n* Countries by wealth inequality\n* Wealth inequality in the United States\n* Income inequality in the United States\n* Most expensive items\n\t+ by category\n* Wealthiest animals\n |\n\n |\n| Related | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSince stock prices fluctuate rapidly, an individual's true wealth and ranking at the time of publication may vary from their situation when the list was compiled.[7]\n\n\nWhen a living individual has dispersed his or her wealth to immediate family members it is included under a single listing (as a single \"family fortune\") provided that individual (the grantor) is still living. However, if a deceased billionaire's fortune has been dispersed, it will not appear as a single listing, and each recipient will only appear if his or her own total net worth is over a $Billion (his or her net worth will not be combined with family members')[7] Royal families and dictators that have their wealth contingent on a position are always excluded from these lists.[9]\n\n\n\n## Annual rankings[edit]\n\n\n\nThe rankings are published annually in March, so the net worths listed are snapshots taken at that time.

Over half of the list is less wealthy compared to the previous year, including Elon Musk, who fell from No. 1 to No. 2.[2] The list also marks for the first time a French citizen was in the top position as well as a non-American for the first time since 2013 when the Mexican Carlos Slim Helu was the world's richest person. The list, like in 2022, counted 15 under 30 billionaires with the richest of them being Red Bull heir Mark Mateschitz with a net worth of $34.7 billion. The youngest of the lot were Clemente Del Vecchio, heir to the Luxottica fortune shared with his six siblings and stepmother, and Kim Jung-yang, whose fortune lies in Japanese-South Korean gaming giant Nexon, both under-20s.[10]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nBillionaires\n |\n| --- |\n| By citizenship | * Argentina\n* Austria\n* Belgium\n* Brazil\n* Canada\n* Chile\n* China (PRC)\n* Colombia\n* Cyprus\n* Czech Republic\n* Denmark\n* Egypt\n* France\n* Germany\n* Greece\n* Hong Kong\n* India\n* Indonesia\n* Ireland\n* Israel\n* Italy\n* Japan\n* Kenya\n* Lebanon\n* Malaysia\n* Mexico\n* Netherlands\n* New Zealand\n* Norway\n* Pakistan\n* Peru\n* Poland\n* Portugal\n* Romania\n* Russia\n* Saudi Arabia\n* Singapore\n* South Africa\n* South Korea\n* Spain\n* Sweden\n* Switzerland\n* Taiwan\n* Thailand\n* Turkey\n* UAE\n* Ukraine\n* United Kingdom\n* United States\n* Vietnam\n |\n| By region | * World\n* Africa\n* ASEAN\n* Europe\n* Latin America\n |\n| *Forbes* lists | * The World's Billionaires\n\t+ 2010\n\t+ 2011\n\t+ 2012\n\t+ 2013\n\t+ 2014\n\t+ 2015\n\t+ 2016\n\t+ 2017\n\t+ 2018\n\t+ 2019\n\t+ 2020\n\t+ 2021\n\t+ 2022\n\t+ 2023\n* *Forbes* 400\n |\n| Lists | * Black\n* Bloomberg Billionaires Index\n* *Financial Review* Rich List (Australia)\n* *Sunday Times* Rich List (UK)\n* *Forbes* Fictional 15\n* LGBT\n* Women\n* Spacetravellers\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n*Forbes* magazine\n |\n| --- |\n| Companies | * *Forbes* Global 2000\n* *Forbes* 500\n | ![](image)\n |\n| People | * The World's Billionaires\n* *Forbes* 400\n* 30 Under 30\n* Australia's 50 Richest People\n* World's Most Powerful People\n* World's 100 Most Powerful Women\n |\n| Entertainment | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| General | * *Forbes* Top 40\n* Celebrity 100\n* *Forbes* Fictional 15\n* China Celebrity 100\n* Korea Power Celebrity 40\n* Highest-paid dead celebrities\n |\n| Fashion | * Highest-paid models\n |\n| Film | * Highest-paid actors\n |\n| Music | * Highest-paid musicians\n |\n| Sport | * Highest-paid athletes\n* Most valuable sports teams\n\t+ Football clubs\n\t\t- MLS clubs\n\t+ NFL teams\n\t+ MLB teams\n\t+ NBA teams\n\t+ NHL teams\n |\n\n |\n| Education | * America's Top Colleges\n |\n| Technology | * Midas List (Tech's Top Deal Makers)\n |\n| Related topics | * Lists of people by net worth\n* Wealthiest musical artists\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nEach year, *Forbes* employs a team of over 50 reporters from a variety of countries to track the activity of the world's wealthiest individuals[7] and sometimes groups or families – who share wealth. Preliminary surveys are sent to those who may qualify for the list. According to *Forbes*, they received three types of responses – some people try to inflate their wealth, others cooperate but leave out details, and some refuse to answer any questions.[8] Business deals are then scrutinized and estimates of valuable assets – land, homes, vehicles, artwork, etc. – are made. Interviews are conducted to vet the figures and improve the estimate of an individual's holdings. Finally, positions in a publicly traded stock are priced to market on a date roughly a month before publication. Privately held companies are priced by the prevailing price-to-sales or price-to-earnings ratios. Known debt is subtracted from assets to get a final estimate of an individual's estimated worth in United States dollars. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n38. **^** Herbert, Geoff (10 March 2011). \"Forbes' 2011 list of 'World's Billionaires' is biggest ever\". *Syracuse Post-Standard*.

The list was first published in March 1987.[1] The total net worth of each individual on the list is estimated and is cited in United States dollars, based on their documented assets and accounting for debt and other factors. Royalty and dictators whose wealth comes from their positions are excluded from these lists.[3] This ranking is an index of the wealthiest documented individuals, excluding any ranking of those with wealth that is not able to be completely ascertained.[4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the 32nd annual *Forbes* list of the world's billionaires, the aggregate wealth of the top 20 richest people on Earth amounted to about 13 percent of all billionaires' fortunes combined.[15] A record of 2,208 billionaires were in the ranking and the total wealth was $9.1 trillion, up 18% since 2017. For the first time, Jeff Bezos was listed as the top billionaire due to Amazon's rising stock price that resulted in one person's biggest one-year gain in wealth ($35 billion) since *Forbes* started tracking in 1987.[15] The U.S. had the most billionaires in the world, with 585, while China was catching up with 476 when including Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan; it had 372 when excluding those three places.[15] Forbes excluded Al-Walid bin Talal and all other Saudi billionaires due to the absence of accurate wealth estimations as a result of the 2017–19 Saudi Arabian purge.[16]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n10. **^**  Liu, Phoebe (4 April 2023). \"The World's Youngest Billionaires 2023\". *Forbes*.

Over half of the list is less wealthy compared to the previous year, including Elon Musk, who fell from No. 1 to No. 2.[2] The list also marks for the first time a French citizen was in the top position as well as a non-American for the first time since 2013 when the Mexican Carlos Slim Helu was the world's richest person. The list, like in 2022, counted 15 under 30 billionaires with the richest of them being Red Bull heir Mark Mateschitz with a net worth of $34.7 billion. The youngest of the lot were Clemente Del Vecchio, heir to the Luxottica fortune shared with his six siblings and stepmother, and Kim Jung-yang, whose fortune lies in Japanese-South Korean gaming giant Nexon, both under-20s.[10]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nEach year, *Forbes* employs a team of over 50 reporters from a variety of countries to track the activity of the world's wealthiest individuals[7] and sometimes groups or families – who share wealth. Preliminary surveys are sent to those who may qualify for the list. According to *Forbes*, they received three types of responses – some people try to inflate their wealth, others cooperate but leave out details, and some refuse to answer any questions.[8] Business deals are then scrutinized and estimates of valuable assets – land, homes, vehicles, artwork, etc. – are made. Interviews are conducted to vet the figures and improve the estimate of an individual's holdings. Finally, positions in a publicly traded stock are priced to market on a date roughly a month before publication. Privately held companies are priced by the prevailing price-to-sales or price-to-earnings ratios. Known debt is subtracted from assets to get a final estimate of an individual's estimated worth in United States dollars. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n38. **^** Herbert, Geoff (10 March 2011). \"Forbes' 2011 list of 'World's Billionaires' is biggest ever\". *Syracuse Post-Standard*.

He transitioned into the banking industry when he became a product manager at Bankers Trust from 1988 to 1990. He then joined D. E. Shaw & Co, a newly created hedge fund with a strong emphasis on mathematical modelling from 1990 until 1994. Bezos became D. E.
