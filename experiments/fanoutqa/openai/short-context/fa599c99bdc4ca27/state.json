Since the mid-1980s, Singapore has had two deputy prime ministers at a time. The holder will sometimes assume the role of acting prime minister when the prime minister is temporarily absent from Singapore.\n\n\nThe office of Deputy Prime Minister dates back to 1959 and it was first appointed by the *Yang di-Pertuan Negara*, when Singapore attained self-governance from the British Empire. \n\n\nThe title of Deputy Prime Minister remained unchanged after the merger with the Federation of Malaya, Sarawak and North Borneo to form Malaysia, while Singapore was a federated state of Malaysia between 1963 and 1965. Toh Chin Chye was the first deputy prime minister of Singapore between 1959 and 1968.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Deputy Prime Minister of theRepublic of Singapore |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)Coat of arms of Singapore\n |\n| ![](image)Flag of Singapore\n |\n| ![](image) ![](image)\n**IncumbentHeng Swee Keatsince 1 May 2019Lawrence Wongsince 13 June 2022**\n |\n| Style | * Deputy Prime Minister(informal)\n* The Honourable(formal)\n* His Excellency(diplomatic)\n |\n| Abbreviation | DPM |\n| Appointer | Prime Minister of Singapore |\n| Term length | At the Prime Minister's pleasure |\n| Inaugural holder | Toh Chin Chye |\n| Formation | 3\u00a0June 1959; 65 years ago\u00a0(1959-06-03) |\n| Salary | S$1,870,000 annually(including S$192,500 MP salary) |\n| Website | www.pmo.gov.sg |\n\nThe **deputy prime minister of Singapore** is the deputy head of government of the Republic of Singapore.

Both Teo Chee Hean and Tharman Shanmugaratnam relinquished their positions. Heng Swee Keat was widely believed to be poised to succeed Lee Hsien Loong as the next prime minister following his appointment as Deputy Prime Minister in May 2019. \n\n\nHeng subsequently withdrew himself from the nomination in April 2021 citing age and health reasons and relinquished his finance portfolio.[1][2]\n\n\nLawrence Wong assumed the office as Deputy Prime Minister on 13 June 2022, serving alongside Heng Swee Keat after being appointed as Minister of Finance.

He also continued to hold the Cabinet portfolio of Minister for Finance.[18] From 1985 to 2019, there had always been two Deputy Prime Ministers sitting concurrently in the Cabinet.[18] The unique circumstance of Heng becoming the sole holder of the office, together with his earlier appointment as the party's first assistant secretary-general, was seen by political observers as paving him the way to becoming the next prime minister.[19]\n\n\nOn 30 June 2020, the Nomination Day for the 2020 general election, Heng announced that he would be contesting in East Coast GRC, after Lim Swee Say stepped down as Member of Parliament of East Coast GRC, which had surprising political observers as he had been expected to run for election in Tampines GRC, which he had been representing for two terms since 2011.[20]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| The Honourable\nHeng Swee Keat\nPPA PJG\n |\n| --- |\n| \u738b\u745e\u6770\n |\n| ![](image)Heng in 2012\n |\n|  |\n| Deputy Prime Minister of Singapore |\n| **Incumbent**\n |\n| **Assumed office** 1 May 2019Serving with Lawrence Wong (2022\u2013present)\n |\n| Prime Minister | Lee Hsien Loong |\n| Preceded by | Tharman ShanmugaratnamTeo Chee Hean |\n| Coordinating Minister for Economic Policies |\n| **Incumbent**\n |\n| **Assumed office** 27 July 2020 |\n| Prime Minister | Lee Hsien Loong |\n| Preceded by | Tharman Shanmugaratnam |\n| Chairman of the People's Action Party |\n| **Incumbent**\n |\n| **Assumed office** 26 November 2022 |\n| Secretary-General | Lee Hsien Loong |\n| Vice Chairman | Masagos Zulkifli |\n| Preceded by | Gan Kim Yong |\n| Minister for Finance |\n| **In office**1 October 2015\u00a0\u2013 14 May 2021 |\n| Prime Minister | Lee Hsien Loong |\n| Second Minister | Lawrence WongIndranee Rajah |\n| Preceded by | Tharman Shanmugaratnam |\n| Succeeded by | Lawrence Wong |\n| Minister for Education |\n| **In office**21 May 2011\u00a0\u2013 30 September 2015 |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Prime Minister | Lee Hsien Loong |\n| Preceded by | Ng Eng Hen |\n| Succeeded by | Ng Chee Meng (Schools)Ong Ye Kung (Higher Education and Skills) |\n| Member of the Singapore Parliamentfor East Coast GRC(Bedok) |\n| **Incumbent**\n |\n| **Assumed office** 10 July 2020 |\n| Preceded by | Lim Swee Say |\n| Member of the Singapore Parliamentfor Tampines GRC(Tampines Central) |\n| **In office**7 May 2011\u00a0\u2013 23 June 2020 |\n| Preceded by | Sin Boon Ann |\n| Succeeded by | Koh Poh Koon |\n|  |\n| Personal details |\n| Born | Heng Swee Keat\n (1961-04-15) 15 April 1961 (age\u00a063)[1]State of Singapore |\n| Political party | People's Action Party |\n| Spouse | \nChang Hwee Nee\n \u200b\n(m.\u00a01988)\u200b\n |\n| Children | 2 |\n| Alma mater | Christ's College, Cambridge (MA) Harvard University (MPA) |\n| Signature | ![](image) |\n|  |\n| **Police career** |\n| Department | Singapore Police Force |\n| Service\u00a0years | 1983\u20131997 |\n| Rank | Assistant Commissioner |\n|  |\n|  |\n|  |\n\n\nIn this Chinese name, the family name is  *Heng*.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Government offices\n |\n| --- |\n| Preceded\u00a0byKoh Yong Guan\n |  **Managing Director  of the Monetary Authority of Singapore** 2005 \u2013 2011\n | Succeeded\u00a0byRavi Menon\n |\n| Political offices\n |\n| Preceded\u00a0byNg Eng Hen\n |  **Minister for Education** 2011 \u2013 2015\n | Succeeded\u00a0byNg Chee Meng\n***as Minister for Education (Schools)*** |\n| Succeeded\u00a0byOng Ye Kung\n***as Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills)*** |\n| Preceded\u00a0byTharman Shanmugaratnam\n |  **Minister for Finance** 2015 \u2013 2021\n | Succeeded\u00a0byLawrence Wong\n |\n| Preceded\u00a0byTeo Chee HeanTharman Shanmugaratnam\n |  **Deputy Prime Minister  Serving with: Lawrence Wong** 2019 \u2013 present\n | **Incumbent** |\n| Parliament of Singapore |\n| Preceded\u00a0bySin Boon Ann\n |  **Member of Parliament  for Tampines GRC (Tampines Central)** 2011 \u2013 2020\n | Succeeded\u00a0byKoh Poh Koon\n |\n| Preceded\u00a0byLim Swee Say\n |  **Member of Parliament  for East Coast GRC (Bedok)** 2020 \u2013 present\n | **Incumbent** |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n15. **^** Anthony\\_chia (24 April 2018). \"Changes to Cabinet and Other Appointments (Apr 2018)\". *Prime Minister's Office Singapore*.
