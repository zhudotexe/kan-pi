The two Chinese characters *Fu* (\u5fa9, means \"again\") and *Dan* (\u65e6, means \"morning\", \"light\" ), meaning both \"(heavenly light shines) day after day\" and \"Aurora Revived\", were chosen by Ma on the recommendation of Yu You-jen, from the Confucian Classic *Shangshu Dazhuan* (Chinese: \u5c19\u66f8\u5927\u50b3): \"Itinerant as the twilight, sun glows and moon luminesces\" (Chinese: \u65e5\u6708\u5149\u83ef\uff0c\u65e6\u5fa9\u65e6\u516e). The university motto \"Scientia et studium, quaestio et cogitatio\" comes from Analects Book 19.6 (Chinese: \u535a\u5b78\u800c\u7be4\u5fd7\uff0c\u5207\u554f\u800c\u8fd1\u601d), which means \"rich in knowledge and tenacious of purposes, inquiring with earnestness and reflecting with self-practice\".\n\n\nIn 1911, during the Xinhai Revolution, the college was occupied as headquarters of the Guangfu Army and closed down for almost one year.[4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1917, Fudan Public School became a private university named the Private Fudan University, and also had a middle school and university-preparatory school. In 1929, Fudan reorganized its departments, expanding to include departments of journalism, municipals[*clarification needed*], law, and education.[4]\n\n\nAfter the Japanese invasion of China in 1937, Fudan moved with the Kuomintang government to the inland city of Chongqing, the wartime Chinese capital. On December 25, 1941, the First Meeting of Fifth Conference of the Highest Executive Authority of the National Government of the Republic of China voted to change Fudan University (Chongqing) to a public university with Wu Nanxuan as its president. Fudan University then became National Fudan University. After the end of World War II, it moved back to Shanghai.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### 1949 - present[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFudan University| \u590d\u65e6\u5927\u5b66\u00a0(Chinese)\n |\n| ![](image) |\n| Former names\n | * Fudan Public School (1905)\n* Fudan College\n* Private Fudan University (1917\u20131941)\n* National Fudan University (1941\u20131949)\n |\n| Motto | \u535a\u5b66\u800c\u7b03\u5fd7\uff0c\u5207\u95ee\u800c\u8fd1\u601d[1] |\n| Motto in\u00a0English\n | Rich in knowledge and tenacious of purposes, inquiring with earnestness and reflecting with self-practice[2] |\n| Type | Public |\n| Established | 1905; 119\u00a0years ago\u00a0(1905) |\n| Founder | Ma Xiangbo |\n| President | Jin Li |\n| Party Secretary | Qiu Xin (\u88d8\u65b0) |\n| Academic staff\n | 2,700 |\n| Administrative staff\n | 5,800 |\n| Students | 31,900 |\n| Undergraduates | 14,100 |\n| Postgraduates | 14,800 |\n| Location | 220 Handan Rd., Yangpu District, Shanghai\n, China\n |\n| Campus | 604 acres (244\u00a0ha) |\n| Affiliations | C9, Universitas 21, AEARU, APRU, BRICS Universities League, Council on Business & Society, ASRMU, Washington University in St. Louis McDonnell International Scholars Academy[3] |\n| Website | fudan.edu.cn |\n|  |\n|  |\n| Chinese name |\n| Simplified Chinese | \u590d\u65e6\u5927\u5b66 |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Fudan lost its \"National\" appellation and became Fudan University to reflect the fact that all universities under the new socialist state would be public.

Four schools were established: a normal school, a school of foreign studies, a middle school, and a high school.

Because of this, funding for research increases yearly. In 2018, the total research funding from the government, industry, and business sectors reached 3.76 billion RMB yuan (about 537 million US dollars). The Harbin campus owned 3.2 billion yuan, the Shenzhen campus owned 443 million yuan, and the Weihai campus owned 132 million yuan. Some media reported that the total research expenditures of HIT reached 7.47 billion RMB yuan (about 1.07 billion US dollars) in 2019.\n\n\n\n### Contributions[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Shenzhen Campus\nAlong with Tsinghua University and Peking University's graduate schools, the HIT Shenzhen Graduate School occupies 0.17 square kilometres (0.066\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of space within Shenzhen University Town. The Shenzhen Campus covers a total floor space of 73,700 square metres (793,000\u00a0sq\u00a0ft) including teaching, research, administration, conference centers, student housing, and cafeteria. Additional space of approximately 53,500 square metres (576,000\u00a0sq\u00a0ft) is under construction.\n\n\n\n### Administration and organization[edit]\n\n\nHarbin Institute of Technology is organized into 20 full-time schools, which hold 73 undergraduate degree programs, 143 master programs, and 81 doctorate programs.

Since it was founded in CE 258, it had evolved and adopted different names in each dynasty or period in ancient China. It became a modern institution of higher learning in 1902 during Qing dynasty. Liangjiang Higher Normal School was closed in 1911 when the Qing dynasty was overthrown. In 1915 after the Republic of China was founded, Nanking Higher Normal School was established to replace the Liangjing Normal School. In 1949 when the Republic of China was replaced by the People's Republic of China in mainland, its name was changed from National Central University (\u56fd\u7acb\u4e2d\u592e\u5927\u5b66) to Nanjing University (\u5357\u4eac\u5927\u5b66).\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 1952, many colleges and departments, mainly colleges of education (or teacher, normal, including art and physical education departments), engineering, agriculture, and medicine, were split from Nanjing University, and many new independent schools were formed, including Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing Institute of Technology which was located at former Nanjing University site and later renamed Southeast University, etc.[Note 5] At the same time, University of Nanking, a private university established in 1888 and sponsored by American churches, was merged into Nanjing University (\u5357\u4eac\u5927\u5b78), which lost its \"national\" appellation in 1950 to reflect the reality that all universities in the PRC would be public, and Nanjing University moved campus to the site of University of Nanking where was west to Gulou Mountain and was also once the site of imperial Nanjing University in ancient times.

It opened on 31 December with 160 students, instead of the planned 500.[7]\n\n\nIn 1900, the university was paralyzed by the Boxer Rebellion, later in the year, the \"Eight-Power Allied Forces\" (\u516b\u56fd\u8054\u519b) entered Beijing and the university's operation was continually suspended. In 1902, \"Jingshi Tongwenguan\", a school established by the Qing court in 1862 for foreign language learning was incorporated into the Imperial University of Peking. In 1904, the university sent 47 students to study abroad, which marked the first time for Chinese higher education institution to send students to foreign countries.\n\n\nFollowing the Xinhai Revolution, the Imperial University of Peking was renamed \"Government University of Peking\" in 1912 and then \"National University of Peking\" in 1919[8] (simplified Chinese: \u56fd\u7acb\u5317\u4eac\u5927\u5b66; traditional Chinese: \u570b\u7acb\u5317\u4eac\u5927\u5b78; pinyin: *Gu\u00f3l\u00ec B\u011bij\u012bng D\u00e0xu\u00e9*).\n\n\n\n### Early Republic of China period (1916\u20131927)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1946, after the Japanese surrender in World War II, Peking University moved back to Beijing.

In June 1896, Minister Li Duanfen proposed to create a university in the capital. On 11 June 1898, the Guangxu Emperor, as part of the Hundred Days' Reform, authorised the creation of the **Imperial University of Peking**[7] (simplified Chinese: \u4eac\u5e08\u5927\u5b66\u5802; traditional Chinese: \u4eac\u5e2b\u5927\u5b78\u5802; pinyin: *J\u012bngsh\u012b D\u00e0xu\u00e9t\u00e1ng*; lit.

Minister Sun Jianai was charged with the implementation. IUP served as the country's foremost institute for higher learning, but also as its highest educational authority.[7] William Alexander Parsons Martin was appointed as the first president.[8] Most of the reforms were abolished when the conservative Empress Dowager Cixi seized power on 21 September. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPhilosopher, national debate champion, co-founder and CEO of Kippa, Kennedy Ekezie (MA, Economics and Management)\n\n\n### Notable academics and staff[edit]\n\n\nPeking University has benefited from the services of notable academics and staff.

As a result, some arts and science faculties of Tsinghua University and former Yenching University were merged into Peking University. At the same time, however, the university lost its Law, Medicine, Engineering and Agriculture schools. These schools and faculties were either merged into other universities or to found new colleges.

In 1938, the three schools moved again, this time further southwest to Kunming, and formed the National Southwestern Associated University.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSackler Museum of Art and Archaeology.[23][24] Notable items in these museums include funerary objects that were excavated in Beijing and date back thousands of years from the graves of royals of the Warring States period.

There are also human bones set up in the traditional burial style of that period.[24]\n\n\nBeyond its main campus, Peking University Health Science Center (PKUHSC) is on Xueyuan Road where the country's most distinguished colleges are, and is a fitting site for academics and research.\n\n\nDuring the Third Front construction, Peking University opened a branch in Hanzhong, Shaanxi.[25]:\u200a179\n\n\nIn 2001, Peking University's Shenzhen campus, the Shenzhen Graduate School, opened its doors.

President Cai, inspired by the German model of academic freedom, introduced faculty governance and democratic management to the university. Cai recruited an intellectually diverse faculty that included some of the most prominent figures in the progressive New Culture Movement, including Hu Shih, Liu Bannong, Ma Yinchu, Li Dazhao, Chen Duxiu, Lu Xun and Liang Shuming. Meanwhile, leading conservatives Gu Hongming and Huang Kan also taught at the university.[9] A firm supporter for freedom of thought, Cai advocated for educational independence and resigned several times protesting the government's policy and interference. \n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

It is affiliated with the Ministry of Education of China. The university is part of Project 985, Project 211, and the Double First Class University Plan.\n\n\nXJTU houses five state key laboratories, four state special laboratories, and two state engineering research centers.[2] Two of its eight affiliated teaching hospitals are ranked among China's top 100 hospitals.[3] It is the hub of the University Alliance of the Silk Road, an international academic alliance under the umbrella of the China's Belt and Road Initiative that aims to build educational collaboration and fuel economic growth in countries along the Silk Road Economic Belt and key partners worldwide.[4][5][6]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe national strategy adopted in 1956 dictated that the majority of Jiao Tong University would be moved to Xi'an, Shaanxi(Chinese: \u4ea4\u901a\u5927\u5b66\u897f\u8fc1). During the movement, the national strategy was changed and there were questions on necessity of the move. Since the majority of the facilities, staffs, faculties and students had already arrived in Xi'an and the campus had started operated, the university decided to operate two campuses, one in Xi'an and another in Shanghai. However, the operation with two campuses were difficult and moving the Xi'an campus back to Shanghai was impossible. Thus, from July 31, 1959, with the approval from State Council of the People's Republic of China, two campuses became independent. The Xi'an campus changed its name to Xi'an Jiaotong University and the Shanghai campus changed its name to Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Xi'an Jiaotong University was immediately listed as a National Key University. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs of 2022, Xi'an Jiaotong University is ranked among China's top-10 research comprehensive universities and ranked first in Western China region, with a combined population of almost 300 million.[24]\n\n\nXi'an Jiaotong University consistently features in the top 300th global universities as ranked by the QS World University Rankings, the U.S. News & World Report, the Center for World University Rankings, and the Academic Ranking of World Universities.[25][26][27][28]\n\n\nXi'an Jiaotong graduates are highly desired in China and worldwide.

It is the only university in Western China to be included in the C9 League and one of only two universities in the Western China region (alongside Sichuan University) that consistently rank among the top-15 comprehensive research universities nationwide.[23]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Republic of China founded the School of Management in 1918. In 1920, the Government Institute of Technology of the Communications Ministry merged with two other colleges and changed its name to **Nan Yang College of Chiao Tung**. In 1938, the Ministry of Education took over the university and renamed it, **National Chiao Tung University** (Chinese: \u56fd\u7acb\u4ea4\u901a\u5927\u5b66). During the anti-Japanese War, the university moved to the French Concession, and in 1940 the state-run branch of Jiaotong University was set up in Chongqing. In 1941, to prevent the Wang puppet government from taking over the university, it continued operations under the name of Private Nanyang University. In 1942, the Wang government took over Shanghai School. So the Education Department of Guomin Government chose Chongqing Branch as the headquarters of Jiaotong University.[*citation needed*] In 1943, the graduate school was founded. After the anti-Japanese War was won, Chongqing headquarter went back to Shanghai and merged with Shanghai School. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe university has partnerships with several other universities that have not been incorporated into the University Alliance of the Silk Road, including Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman[*citation needed*] and Washington University in St. Louis through the McDonnell International Scholars Academy.[35][36]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University\n* Shanghai Jiao Tong University\n* Southwest Jiaotong University\n* Beijing Jiaotong University\n* Hingchu Chiao Tung University\n* BlueSky Open Platform\n* The High School Affiliated to Xi'an Jiaotong University\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBesides, the school has actively developed recruitment and training for the students with bachelor's degree of Clinical Medicine and MPH.\n\n\n\n## International program: University Alliance of the Silk Road[edit]\n\n\nMain article: University Alliance of the Silk Road\n\n![](image)Old building in Xi'an Jiaotong University\nAs the major trading site of the silk road, Xi'an has emerged as the site of a major international university alliance associated with the One Belt, One Road initiative.

On June 6, the Chinese People's Liberation Army Hangzhou Municipal Military Control Commission decided to implement a military takeover of National Chekiang University and sent military representative Lin Hujia and deputy military representative Liu Yifu to the school to take over the university. In September, the Department of Agricultural Economics of the Private Nantong University College of Agriculture was merged into Chekiang University.[7]\n\n\nIn October 1950, the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China ordered universities nationwide to remove the words \"national,\" \"provincial,\" and \"municipal\" from their school names. National Chekiang University changed its name to Chekiang University.\n\n\nIn 1958, by the standardization of Chinese pinyin system, the university changed its name to Zhejiang University.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring the 19 November 1938 university council meeting, the neo-Confucianism scholar Ma Yifu, who was teaching at Chekiang was invited by President Chu to be the lyric writer of the university anthem, upon Chu's advice. However, as the lyric by Ma was written in Classical Chinese and thus difficult-to-understand, the anthem wasn't composed until Professor Ying Shangneng at National Conservatory of Music was invited to compose the anthem in the summer of 1941. In 2014, the Zhejiang University Anthem was ranked the most popular university anthem, according to an online survey by the news office of the Ministry of Education.[62]\n\n\n\n![](image)An installation art work of Qiushi eagle for 120th Anniversary of Zhejiang University at Yuquan Campus in 2017\n### Mascot, logo and flag[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nSeal of National Chekiang University (1920s and 1930s)\n![A trout](image)\nLogo of Zhejiang University (since 1991)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe university's mascot is Qiushi eagle, which was first portrayed within its seal used by National Chekiang University during the 1920s and 1930s and then reintroduced in the 1990 logo of Zhejiang University.[63] The Qiushi eagle also appears in the logos of NingboTech University and Zhejiang University City College,[64][65] which was formerly affiliated institutions of Zhejiang University turned independent in December 2019.[63]\n\n\nThe current logo of Zhejiang University was introduced by the university council meeting in January 1991. The logo was officially digitized in May 2017.[66] The Chinese character calligraphy in the logo is taken from Mao Zedong's writing.[67] A combination of the calligraphy and logo in red or blue if using a blank flag or in white if using a blue or red flag is used as the flags of the university.[68]\n\n\n\n### Quotes of Chu Kochen[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe university had a Hubin campus, which was the former site of Zhejiang Medical University.

In 2021, it received 2.38 billion Chinese yuan, the fourth most after Tsinghua, Peking and Wuhan.[86] On September 21, 2006, Chinese billionaires Duan Yongping (Zhejiang University alumnus) and Ding Lei (Zhejiang native) donated together a one-time endowment of 40 million US dollars to Zhejiang University. US$30 million was from Duan with 10\u00a0million from Ding. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nZhejiang University is a comprehensive research university.
