Three have made the trip twice, and twelve have walked on its surface. Apollo 8 was a lunar-orbit-only mission, Apollo 10 included undocking and Descent Orbit Insertion (DOI), followed by LM staging to CSM redocking, while Apollo 13, originally scheduled as a landing, ended up as a lunar fly-by, by means of free return trajectory; thus, none of these missions made landings. Apollo 7 and Apollo 9 were Earth-orbit-only missions. Apart from the inherent dangers of crewed Moon expeditions as seen with Apollo 13, one reason for their cessation according to astronaut Alan Bean is the cost it imposes in government subsidies.[30]\n\n\n\n### Human Moon landings[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTwo organizations have attempted but failed to achieve soft landings: Israeli private space agency SpaceIL with their Beresheet spacecraft, and Japanese company ispace's Hakuto-R Mission 1.\n\n\nOn August 23, 2023, ISRO successfully landed its Chandrayaan-3 module at the lunar south pole, making India the fourth nation to successfully complete a soft landing on the Moon.[7] Chandrayaan-3 saw a successful soft landing of its *Vikram* lander and *Pragyan* rover at 6.04pm IST (1234 GMT), marking the first uncrewed soft landing in the little-explored region.[8]\n\n\n\n## Crewed landings[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Apollo program\n\nSee also: List of people who have walked on the Moon\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Model of Luna 16 Moon soil sample return lander\n![](image)Model of Soviet Lunokhod automatic Moon rover\nThe Luna 9 spacecraft, launched by the Soviet Union, performed the first successful soft Moon landing on 3 February 1966. Airbags protected its 99 kilograms (218 lb) ejectable capsule which survived an impact speed of over 15 metres per second (54 km/h; 34 mph).[25] Luna 13 duplicated this feat with a similar Moon landing on 24 December 1966. Both returned panoramic photographs that were the first views from the lunar surface.[26]\n\n\nLuna 16 was the first robotic probe to land on the Moon and safely return a sample of lunar soil back to Earth.[27] It represented the first lunar sample return mission by the Soviet Union, and was the third lunar sample return mission overall, following the Apollo 11 and Apollo 12 missions. This mission was later successfully repeated by Luna 20 (1972) and Luna 24 (1976).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n38. **^** \"Eureka! Ice Found At Lunar Poles\". NASA. 2012.

There was a market relationship between the people and the state as the employer; people were free to choose their job and leave if they wished, although members of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union could be ordered to work in certain places, but seldom were.[23]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs the detailed data series that was ultimately published in the late 1980s showed, the reported IMR for the Soviet Union as a whole increased from 24.7 in 1970 to a peak of 31.4 in 1976. After that the IMR gradually decreased and by 1989 it had fallen to 22.7, which was lower than had been reported in any previous year (though close to the figure of 22.9 in 1971).[13] In 1989, the IMR ranged from a low of 11.1 in the Latvian SSR to a high of 54.7 in the Turkmen SSR.[14]\n\n\nResearch conducted after the dissolution of the Soviet Union revealed that the originally reported mortality rates vary substantially underestimated the actual rates, especially for infant mortality. This has been shown for Transcaucasian and Central Asian republics.[15][16]\n\n\nAfter two decades of declining and stagnating fertility rates, the Soviet TFR rose from 2.27 in 1978-79 to 2.51 in 1986-87.

At first, this was due to the incorporation of new territories westward in Europe after World War II, such as the Polish Eastern Borderlands, the Baltic states, Carpathian Ruthenia, and Bessarabia. This resulted in an increase of non-Russian ethnic groups, especially those who were Belarusian, Ukrainian, Polish, Moldovan, Lithuanian, Latvian, and Estonian. However, starting in the 1960s, the decline of the Russian majority was mainly driven by indigenous ethnic groups residing in the Caucasian and Central Asian Soviet republics. For example, the five main Central Asian groups, Uzbeks, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, Tajiks, and Turkmens, together saw a 163.81% increase from 1959 to 1989. Azerbaijanis, the largest Muslim group in the Soviet Caucasus, grew from 2.9 million people to almost 6.8 million during the same time, which represents a 130.31% increase. \n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_Uf6EPJhd98MTyAVCHWNluVLE","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

It was by far the most thorough and accurate census taken since 1949 and confirmed that China was a nation of more than 1 billion people, or about one-fifth of the world's population. The census provided demographers with a set of data on China's age-sex structure, fertility and mortality rates, and population density and distribution. Information was also gathered on minority ethnic groups, urban population, and marital status. For the first time since the People's Republic of China was founded, demographers had reliable information on the size and composition of the Chinese work force. The nation began preparing for the 1982 census in late 1976. Chinese census workers were sent to the United States and Japan to study modern census-taking techniques and automation.

Under Mao Zedong, China nearly doubled in population from 540 million in 1949 to 969 million in 1979. This growth slowed because of the one-child policy instituted in 1979.[13] The 2022 data shows a declining population for the first time since 1961.[14]\n\n\n\n![](image)Population pyramid of China from 1950 to 2022\n![](image)Age structure projections for China up to 2100\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

In 1987, the government announced that the fourth national census would take place in 1990 and that there would be one every ten years thereafter. The 1982 census (which reported a total population of 1,008,180,738) is generally accepted as significantly more reliable, accurate, and thorough than the previous two.[15] Various international organizations eagerly assisted the Chinese in conducting the 1982 census, including the United Nations Fund for Population Activities, which donated US$100.0 million between 1980-1989 for a variety of projects, one of which being the 1982 census.[16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n14. **^** Ng, Kelly (17 January 2023). \"China's population falls for first time since 1961\". *BBC News*.

It determined the resident population of the United States to be 248,709,873, an increase of 9.8 percent over the 226,545,805 persons enumerated during the 1980 census.[1]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nApproximately 16 percent of households received a \"long form\" of the 1990 census, which contained more than 100 questions. Full documentation on the 1990 census, including census forms and a procedural history, is available from the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series.\n\n\nIt was the first census to designate \"Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander\" as a racial group separate from Asians.\n\n\nTo increase black participation in the 1990 United States census, the bureau recruited Bill Cosby, Magic Johnson, Alfre Woodard, and Miss America Debbye Turner as spokespeople.[2] The Integrated Public Use Microdata Series.

Consequently, this affected the number of votes each state has in the Electoral College for the 1992 presidential election.\n\n\nBecause of population changes, twenty-one states had changes in their number of seats.
