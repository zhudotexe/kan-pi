It includes top-three placings in the 1896 Olympic Games and 1900 Olympic Games, before medals were actually awarded for those placings. Medals won in the 1906 Intercalated Games are not included.\nFor simplicity, when an athlete has won medals for more than one nation, their entry in this list only mentions the last **Nation** represented. The **Years** listed for each athlete only include the Games in which they won medals.

The International Paralympic Committee noted that \"'Operation Gold Awards' for [American] Paralympic athletes [would] be increased by as much as 400 percent.\"[54]\n\n\n\n## Doping[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe 1968 Mexico Olympics became the most successful summer games for the US in the post-war era. American athletes amassed 45 gold and 107 total medals, 16 gold and 16 total medals more than the second-placed Soviets. The US swimming team dominated the competition, winning a staggering 51 medals and sweeping the podium on five occasions. The Americans also managed to medal in every single of 29 swimming events, thus achieving a unique feat. The US track and field team pulled off a stellar performance as well with 15 gold and 28 total medals. Overall, swimming and athletics accounted for more than 70% of all US medals and ensured the first place in the medal table for the Americans, their second consecutive first-place finish in terms of gold medals, and their first finish at the top of the overall medal table since 1952. In other sports, however, the performance of American athletes was less convincing. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe United States of America has sent many athletes to the celebration of the Olympic Games, starting with the first modern Olympics held in 1896. The United States has sent athletes to every Olympic Games with the exception of the 1980 Summer Olympics, during which it led a boycott in protest of the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan. The United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee (USOPC) is the National Olympic Committee for the United States.\n\n\nAmerican athletes have won a total of 2,629 medals (1,061 of them gold) at the Summer Olympic Games, and another 330 (113 of them gold) at the Winter Olympic Games. This makes the United States the most prolific medal-winning nation in the history of the Olympics. The United States remains one of the only major teams in the world to receive no government funding.[1][2][3][4][5]\n\n\n\n\n## Hosted Games[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| ![](image) Mountain biking | 0 | 0 | 2 | 2 |\n| ![](image) Skateboarding | 0 | 0 | 2 | 2 |\n| ![](image) Karate | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |\n| Totals (47 entries) | 1061 | 829 | 737 | 2627 |\n\n*Updated on December 31, 2021*\n\\**This table does not include two medals \u2013 one silver awarded in the ice hockey and one bronze awarded in the figure skating events at the 1920 Summer Olympics.*\nThe United States has never won an Olympic medal in the following current summer sports or disciplines: badminton, handball, rhythmic gymnastics, table tennis and trampoline gymnastics.\n | Medals by winter sport[edit]\n**Leading in that sport**\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n47. **^** https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP80-00810A005900310006-0.pdf [*bare URL PDF*]\n48. **^** https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP80-00810A005800260002-1.pdf [*bare URL PDF*]\n49. **^** \"The Role of Sports in The Soviet Union \u2013 Guided History\". *blogs.bu.edu*.\n50. **^** Cao, Athena Cao (15 August 2016) Uncle Sam goes for gold, too: Up to $9,900 per Olympic gold medal First Coast News via USA Today\n51. **^** \"USOC Increases 'Operation Gold' Payouts By 25% Beginning in 2017\". *Swimswam.com*.

They were still disadvantaged by these rules in those sports where they weren't abolished (i.e., boxing, baseball, where Cubans continued to field state-sponsored pros against American amateurs), but the situation started improving.\n\n\n\n### Recent period (1994\u2013present)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | This section **needs expansion**.

He is the most successful and most decorated Olympian of all time[7] with a total of 28 medals.[8] Phelps also holds the all-time records for Olympic gold medals (23),[9] Olympic gold medals in individual events (13), and Olympic medals in individual events (16).[10] At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Phelps tied the record of eight medals of any color at a single Games, held by gymnast Alexander Dityatin, by winning six gold and two bronze medals. Four years later, when he won eight gold medals at the 2008 Beijing Games, he broke fellow American swimmer Mark Spitz's 1972 record of seven first-place finishes at any single Olympic Games. At the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, Phelps won four gold and two silver medals, and at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, he won five gold medals and one silver. This made him the most successful athlete of the Games for the fourth Olympics in a row.[11][12]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n7. **^** Walters, Tanner (August 13, 2016). \"Michael Phelps: 30 medals in Tokyo?

Along with Natalie Coughlin, Dara Torres, and Jenny Thompson, he is the second-most decorated swimmer in Olympic history measured by total number of medals, behind only Michael Phelps.[2] Lochte's seven individual Olympic medals rank second in history in men's swimming (again to Michael Phelps), tied for second among all Olympic swimmers. He currently holds the world records in the 200-meter individual medley (long and short course). As part of the American teams, he also holds the world record in the 4\u00d7200-meter freestyle (long course) and 4\u00d7100-meter freestyle (mixed) relay.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Ryan Lochte \u2013 navigation templates\n |\n| --- |\n| | * v\n* t\n* e\n2004 USA Olympic swimming team\n |\n| --- |\n| Qualification | * 2004 United States Olympic Trials\n | ![](image)\n |\n| Men's team | * Ian Crocker\n* Nate Dusing\n* Mark Gangloff\n* Scott Goldblatt\n* Gary Hall Jr.\n* Brendan Hansen\n* Bryce Hunt\n* Larsen Jensen\n* Klete Keller\n* Dan Ketchum\n* Lenny Krayzelburg (team captain)\n* Jason Lezak\n* Ryan Lochte\n* Tom Malchow (team captain)\n* Aaron Peirsol\n* Michael Phelps\n* Scott Usher\n* Peter Vanderkaay\n* Erik Vendt\n* Neil Walker\n* Gabe Woodward\n |\n| Women's team | * Amanda Beard\n* Lindsay Benko (team captain)\n* Caroline Bruce\n* Kristen Caverly\n* Haley Cope\n* Maritza Correia\n* Natalie Coughlin\n* Margaret Hoelzer\n* Katie Hoff\n* Rhi Jeffrey\n* Kara Lynn Joyce\n* Kalyn Keller\n* Dana Kirk\n* Tara Kirk\n* Rachel Komisarz\n* Colleen Lann\u00e9\n* Diana Munz\n* Carly Piper\n* Kaitlin Sandeno\n* Jenny Thompson\n* Dana Vollmer\n* Amanda Weir\n |\n| Coaches | * Bob Bowman\n* Frank Busch\n* Teri McKeever\n* Richard Quick\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n82. **^** \"USA's Ryan Lochte, Rebecca Soni Sweep Swimming World World, American Swimmers of the Year Awards\". *Swimming World*.
