Construction costs per kilowatt of generating capacity will also depend on geographic factors such as availability of cooling water, earthquake likelihood, and availability of suitable power grid connections. So it is not possible to accurately estimate costs on a global basis.\n\n\n\n### Levelized cost of energy estimates[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Due to the dominant role of initial construction costs and the multi-year construction time, the interest rate for the capital required (as well as the timeline that the plant is completed in) has a major impact on the total cost of building a new nuclear plant.\n\n\nLazard's report on the estimated levelized cost of energy by source (10th edition) estimated unsubsidized prices of $97–$136/MWh for nuclear, $50–$60/MWh for solar PV, $32–$62/MWh for onshore wind, and $82–$155/MWh for offshore wind.[83]\n\n\nHowever, the most important subsidies to the nuclear industry do not involve cash payments. Rather, they shift construction costs and operating risks from investors to taxpayers and ratepayers, burdening them with an array of risks including cost overruns, defaults to accidents, and nuclear waste management. This approach has remained remarkably consistent throughout the nuclear industry's history, and distorts market choices that would otherwise favor less risky energy investments.[84]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n35. **^** George S.

The £100 million vessel, the *Akademik Lomonosov*, is the first of seven plants (70 MWe per ship) that Moscow says will bring vital energy resources to remote Russian regions.[117] Startup of the first of the ships two reactors was announced in December 2018.[118]\n\n\nFollowing the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011, costs are likely to go up for currently operating and new nuclear power plants, due to increased requirements for on-site spent fuel management and elevated design basis threats.[119] After Fukushima, the International Energy Agency halved its estimate of additional nuclear generating capacity built by 2035.[120]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)EDF has said its third-generation Flamanville 3 project (seen here in 2010) will be delayed until 2018, due to \"both structural and economic reasons,\" and the project's total cost had climbed to EUR 11 billion by 2012.[1] In 2019, the start-up was once again pushed back, making it unlikely it could be started before the end of 2022. In July 2020, the French Court of Audit estimated the cost will reach €19.1 billion, more than 5 times the original cost estimate. The initial low cost forecasts for these megaprojects exhibited \"optimism bias\".[2]\nNuclear power construction costs have varied significantly across the world and in time. Large and rapid increases in cost occurred during the 1970s, especially in the United States. Recent cost trends in countries such as Japan and Korea have been very different, including periods of stability and decline in costs.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNew nuclear power plants typically have high capital expenditure for building plants. Fuel, operational, and maintenance costs are relatively small components of the total cost. The long service life and high capacity factor of nuclear power plants allow sufficient funds for ultimate plant decommissioning and waste storage and management to be accumulated, with little impact on the price per unit of electricity generated. Additionally, measures to mitigate climate change such as a carbon tax or carbon emissions trading, favor the economics of nuclear power over fossil fuel power. Nuclear power is cost competitive with the renewable generation when the capital cost is in the region of 2000-3000 ($/KW).
