Principal photography took place in the Bahamas, Italy, the United Kingdom, and the Czech Republic, with interior sets built at Pinewood Studios and Barrandov Studios. *Casino Royale* features primarily practical stuntwork as opposed to the computer-generated placements seen in other *Bond* films.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Daniel Craig as James Bond: A British MI6 officer newly assigned 00 status, giving him a licence to kill.

Eon Productions gained the rights to *Casino Royale* in 1999 after Sony Pictures Entertainment exchanged them for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's rights to *Spider-Man*.[12] In March 2004, Neal Purvis and Robert Wade began writing a screenplay for Pierce Brosnan as Bond, aiming to bring back the flavour of Ian Fleming's original *Bond* novels.[13] An early draft featured Bond backpacking in Madagascar and playing chess with Lord Lucan.[14] As the drafts became closer to being finalized, the opening scene in which Bond earns his 00 license was originally going to consist of an adaptation of either the short stories \"The Hildebrand Rarity\" or \"007 in New York.\" Rather than bombing the Skyfleet jet, there would have been a hijacking of a cruise ship in Cape Town.[14]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn January 2007, *Casino Royale* became the first Bond film ever to be shown in mainland Chinese cinemas. The Chinese version was edited before release, with the reference to the Cold War re-dubbed and new dialogue added during the poker scene explaining the process of Texas hold 'em, as the game is less familiar in China (this addition is reminiscent of dialogue that was added to the 1954 American TV adaptation to explain the rules of baccarat, the game featured in the original book). *Casino Royale* has earned approximately $11.7 million in China since its opening on 30 January on 468 screens,[70] including a record opening weekend collection for a non-Chinese film, with $1.5 million.[71]\n\n\nAfter critics dubbed *Die Another Day* \"Buy Another Day\" because of around 20 product placement deals, Eon limited their promotions for *Casino Royale*. Partners included Ford, Heineken (which Eva Green starred in adverts for), Smirnoff, Omega SA, Virgin Atlantic and Sony Ericsson.[72]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n92. **^** Bresnan, Conor (20 November 2006). \"Around the World Roundup: 'Casino' Cashes In\". *Box Office Mojo*.

The site's critical consensus reads: \"Brutal and breathless, *Quantum Of Solace* delivers tender emotions along with frenetic action, but coming on the heels of *Casino Royale*, it's still a bit of a disappointment.\"[139] On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 58 out of 100 based on 48 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[140] Critics generally preferred *Casino Royale*, but continued to praise Craig's depiction of Bond, and agree that the film is still an enjoyable addition to the series. The action sequences and pacing were praised, but criticism grew over the realism and serious but gritty feeling that the film carried over.[141] The film earned an average grade of \"B−\" from CinemaScore's audience surveys, on an A+ to F scale, the lowest of the Craig's era as Bond.[142]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n2008 James Bond film\n\nThis article is about the film.

The inclusion of Spectre and its associated characters marked the end of the *Thunderball* controversy, in which Kevin McClory and Fleming were embroiled in lengthy legal disputes over the film rights to the novel; *Spectre* is the first film to feature these elements since *Diamonds Are Forever* (1971). Following the Sony Pictures hack, it was revealed Sony and Eon clashed regarding finance, stunts, and filming locations; *Spectre* is estimated to have a final budget of $245–300 million, making it one of the most expensive films ever made. Principal photography began in December 2014 and lasted until July 2015, with filming locations including Austria, the United Kingdom, Italy, Morocco, and Mexico.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the United States and Canada the film opened on 6 November 2015, and in its opening weekend, was originally projected to gross $70–75 million from 3,927 screens, the widest release for a Bond film.[169] However, after it grossed $5.3 million from its early Thursday night showings and $28 million on its opening day, weekend projections were increased to $75–80 million. The film ended up grossing $70.4 million in its opening weekend (about $20 million less than *Skyfall'*s $90.6 million debut, including IMAX previews), but nevertheless finished first at the box office.[170] IMAX generated $9.1 million for *Spectre* at 374 screens, premium large format made $8 million from 429 cinemas, reaping 11% of the film's opening, which means that *Spectre* earned $17.1 million (23%) of its opening weekend total in large-format venues. Cinemark XD generated $1.9 million in 112 XD locations.[170][171]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n190. **^** Franich, Darren (10 November 2015). \"A serious attempt to understand the ending of Spectre\". *Entertainment Weekly*.
