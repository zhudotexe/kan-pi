A charter of privilege was bestowed upon the society of masters and scholars by the Bishop of St Andrews, Henry Wardlaw,[14] on 28 February 1411–12.[15] Wardlaw then successfully petitioned the Avignon Pope Benedict XIII to grant the school university status by issuing a series of papal bulls, which followed on 28 August 1413.[16] King James I of Scotland confirmed the charter of the university in 1432.

In response to the need for modernisation and in order to increase student numbers and alleviate financial problems, the university had, by 1883, established a university college in Dundee which formally merged with St Andrews in 1897.[35] From its inception, the Dundee college had a focus on scientific, and professional subjects; the college's mixed sexes read Classics and English at St Andrews. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe University of St Andrews is situated in the small town of St Andrews in rural Fife, Scotland. The university has teaching facilities, libraries, student housing and other buildings spread throughout the town. Generally, university departments and buildings are concentrated on North Street, South Street, The Scores, and the North Haugh. The university has two major sites within the town. The first is the United College, St Andrews (also known as the Quad or St Salvator's) on North Street, which functions both as a teaching space and venue for student events, incorporating the Departments of Social Anthropology and Modern Languages. The second is St Mary's College, St Andrews, based on South Street, which houses the Schools of Divinity, Psychology and Neuroscience, as well as the King James Library. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**University of St Andrews** at Wikipedia's sister projects\n\n* ![](image)Media from Commons\n* ![](image)News from Wikinews\n* ![](image)Quotations from Wikiquote\n* ![](image)Texts from Wikisource\n\n* Official website\n* University of St Andrews Students' Association Website\n* Research@StAndrews:FullText, the university's digital repository of research output\n* BBC Your Paintings, Public Catalogue Foundation\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nUniversity of St Andrews\n |\n| --- |\n| Governance | * **Chancellor:** Menzies Campbell\n* **Principal:** Sally Mapstone\n* **Rector:** Stella Maris\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1889 the Universities (Scotland) Act[27] made it possible to formally admit women to St Andrews and to receive an education equal to that of male students.

The founding of the University of Cambridge, however, was inspired largely by an incident at the University of Oxford during which three Oxford scholars, as an administration of justice in the death of a local Oxford-area woman, were hanged by town authorities without first consulting ecclesiastical authorities, who traditionally would be inclined to pardon scholars in such cases. But during this time, Oxford's town authorities were in conflict with King John. Fearing more violence from Oxford townsfolk, University of Oxford scholars began leaving Oxford for more hospitable cities, including Paris, Reading, and Cambridge. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n59. **^** \"Map of the University of Cambridge\".

As chancellor, Albert reformed university curricula beyond its initial focus on mathematics and classics, adding modern era history and the natural sciences. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n14. **^** \"Nobel prize winners\".

The main campus is in South Kensington, where most teaching and research takes place. A second campus in White City provides a platform for innovation and entrepreneurship. Facilities also include teaching hospitals throughout London that form an academic health science centre. The college was previously a member of the University of London and became an independent university in 2007.[9] Imperial has a highly international community, with 59% of students from outside the UK and 140 countries represented on campus.[10][11]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Prince Albert was the main patron of the early Royal Colleges and the development of an area of culture in South Kensington\nMain article: History of Imperial College London\n\n### 19th century[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2003, Imperial was granted degree-awarding powers in its own right by the Privy Council. In 2004, the Imperial College Business School and a new main college entrance on Exhibition Road were opened.[40][41] The UK Energy Research Centre was also established in 2004 and opened its headquarters at Imperial. On 9 December 2005, Imperial announced that it would commence negotiations to secede from the University of London.[42] Imperial became fully independent of the University of London in July 2007.[9][43][44]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 8 July 1907, Edward VII granted a Royal Charter establishing the Imperial College of Science and Technology. This incorporated the Royal School of Mines and the Royal College of Science. It also made provisions for the City and Guilds College to join once conditions regarding its governance were met, as well as for Imperial to become a college of the University of London.[22] The college joined the University of London on 22 July 1908, with the City and Guilds College joining in 1910.[8][23] The main campus of Imperial College was constructed beside the buildings of the Imperial Institute, the new building for the Royal College of Science having opened across from it in 1906, and the foundation stone for the Royal School of Mines building being laid by King Edward VII in July 1909.[20]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n17. **^** \"Imperial College\". *british-history.ac.uk*.
