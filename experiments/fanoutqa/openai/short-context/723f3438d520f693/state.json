She also reached No. 15 with \"Shake It Off\" and No. 69 with \"It's Like That\" featuring Jermaine Dupri and Fatman Scoop.\nThe *Billboard* Hot 100 is a chart that ranks the best-performing singles of the United States. Its data, published by *Billboard* magazine and compiled by Nielsen SoundScan, is based collectively on each single's weekly physical and digital sales, as well as airplay and streaming. At the end of a year, *Billboard* will publish an annual list of the 100 most successful songs throughout that year on the Hot 100 chart based on the information. For 2005, the list was published on December 20, calculated with data from December 4, 2004, to November 26, 2005.[1] The R&B track \"We Belong Together\" by American singer Mariah Carey was named the number 1 song of 2005 and it spent the longest time at number 1 for the year, 14 weeks. This is also the third-longest time at number 1 for a single in the 57-year history of the Hot 100 post-1958 inception, after Mariah Carey's own collaboration with Boyz II Men, \"One Sweet Day\", which spent 16 weeks atop the Hot 100 from 1995 to 1996, and \"Despacito\" by Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee, featuring Justin Bieber, which equaled that mark in 2017, both being beaten in 2019 by \"Old Town Road\" by Lil Nas X and Billy Ray Cyrus, which had 19 weeks at No. 1.\n\n\n\n## List[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rapper 50 Cent had six songs on the chart, five of them in the top 40, the highest one being \"Candy Shop\" at number eight.\n![](image)Singer Ciara had four songs in the top 40 of the chart, the highest one being \"1, 2 Step\" at number five.\n![](image)The Black Eyed Peas had three songs on the chart, two of which are in the top forty.\n\n\nList of songs on *Billboard*'s 2005 Year-End Hot 100 chart[2]\n| No.\n | Title\n | Artist(s)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | \"We Belong

The song was released on March 15, 2005, through Island Records, as the second single from the album. \"We Belong Together\" was written by Carey, Jermaine Dupri, Manuel Seal, and Johnt\u00e1 Austin and produced by the former three. Since the song interpolates lyrics from Bobby Womack's \"If You Think You're Lonely Now\" (1981) and the Deele's \"Two Occasions\" (1987), the songwriters of those respective songs are credited. \"We Belong Together\" is built on a simple piano arrangement with an understated backbeat. The lyrics chronicle a woman's desperation for her former lover to return.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n124. **^** \"Mariah Carey \u2013 We Belong Together\". ARIA Top 50 Singles.

The song, which was written and produced by Max Martin and Lukasz \"Dr. Luke\" Gottwald, was released as the lead single from *Breakaway* two weeks before the album was released. It is an uptempo pop rock and power pop power ballad that infuses electronic sounds with a mixture of a soft and loud pop rock sound. Martin originally wrote \"Since U Been Gone\" with Pink in mind, but she turned it down. It was then given to Hilary Duff, but she rejected the song because she could not reach its higher notes. The song was finally given to Clarkson after Clive Davis convinced the writers to give it to her. Clarkson decided to add heavier guitars and harder drums to the song after noticing that the demo had an obvious pop sound. Lyrically, the song is written from a woman's point of view where she expresses her sense of relief with the end of her troubled relationship.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Anticipation at Fever Pitch for 'Breakaway,' Second Album from Kelly Clarkson\".

We see Ciara and her dancers, dancing in the Atlanta dance studio, and certain shots of her teaching her female friend the \"1, 2 Step\". We then see a clip of Ciara meeting up with B5 and performing the \"1, 2 Step\". Later, Ciara is seen dancing alone on the streets. While dancing at the studio, she looks behind her, and sees Elliott in the mirror, says she is just looking things. Then Elliott begins to rap her verse and they continue dancing with each other in front of the mirror, until the songs ends. During this time, we also see shots of Ciara teaching a group of young girls the dance and also, she meets a boy who is standing in front of his house and kind of gives him a flirtatious look. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Breihan, Tom (December 19, 2022). \"The Number Ones: Mario's \"Let Me Love You\"\". *Stereogum*.

In the United Kingdom and Ireland, \"1, 2 Step\" entered and peaked at number three on both the UK and Irish Singles Charts.[20][21] In Ireland, the single stayed at three for three weeks. The song reached number two in Australia for one week and in New Zealand for two weeks.[22][23] It was a top-30 hit in Belgium (Flanders and Wallonia), France, the Netherlands, and Sweden.[24]\n\n\n\n## Music video[edit]\n\n\nThe music video for \"1, 2 Step\" was directed by Benny Boom. It takes place in an Atlanta dance studio and on the streets. R&B boy band, B5, makes a short appearance in the video, along with Lloyd and Lil Scrappy. Ciara can be seen teaching others the song's title \"one, two step\" dance, which is similar to the traditional grapevine.\n\n\n\n### Synopsis[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWe also see four skaters, three male, and one female skater, skating in the streets and a last shot of Ciara and her dancers.\n\n\n\n## Track listings[edit]\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **US 12-inch single**[25]\n\nA1. \"1, 2 Step\" (main) \u2013 3:22\nA2. \"1, 2 Step\" (instrumental) \u2013 3:22\nB1. \"1, 2 Step\" (main) \u2013 3:22\nB2. \"1, 2 Step\" (acappella) \u2013 3:14\n**UK CD1**[26]\n1. \"1, 2 Step\" (album version) \u2013 3:22\n2. \"1, 2 Step\" (instrumental) \u2013 3:22\n\n**UK CD2**[27]\n1. \"1, 2 Step\" (album version) \u2013 3:22\n2. \"1, 2 Step\" (Delinquent \"Growing Pains\" remix) \u2013 4:55\n3. \"1, 2 Step\" (Phatbelly club remix) \u2013 3:30\n4. \"1, 2 Step\" (Eazy remix) \u2013 5:16\n5. \"1, 2 Step\" (video)\n | **UK 12-inch single**[28]\n\nA1. \"1, 2 Step\" (album version) \u2013 3:22\nA2. \"1, 2 Step\" (Phatbelly club remix) \u2013 3:30\nB1. \"1, 2 Step\" (Delinquent \"Growing Pains\" remix) \u2013 4:55\nB2. \"1, 2 Step\" (Eazy remix) \u2013 5:16\n**European CD single**[29]\n1. \"1, 2 Step\" (album version) \u2013 3:22\n2. \"1, 2 Step\" (Johnny Budz Mixshow edit) \u2013 4:40\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Angel. Music. Baby.* (2004). It is a hip-hop song that draws influence from 1980s hip-hop and dance music. The song was written by Stefani, Pharrell Williams, and Chad Hugo, with the latter two handling production as the Neptunes. The song was released as the album's third single on March 22, 2005, and was one of the year's most popular songs, peaking inside the top 10 of the majority of the charts it entered. It reached number one in Australia and the United States, where it became the first digital download to sell one million copies.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n13. **^** \"Gwen Stefani \u2013 Hollaback Girl \u2013 Video Streams\". *Contactmusic.com*.

She's going to ruin everything'.\" She revealed that she too did not know why she was recording a solo album.[2] For the remainder of the evening, Stefani and Pharrell incorporated this inspiration into the lyrics that eventually became \"Hollaback Girl\". The two decided that Stefani did not have to have an answer for her intentions and that the choices she made were based on what she felt was wrong or right.[2] On its creation, Stefani said, \"To me, it is the freshest attitude song I've heard in so long.\" Pharrell was pleased with the song, commenting, \"Gwen is like the girl in high school who just had her own style.\"[3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n73. **^** Bacle, Ariana (May 6, 2014). \"'The Voice': Gwen Stefani and Pharrell perform 'Hollaback Girl' \u2013 Video\". *Entertainment Weekly*.
