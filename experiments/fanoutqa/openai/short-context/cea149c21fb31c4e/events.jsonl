The group's objective—to overthrow Castro via espionage, sabotage, and other covert tactics—was never pursued.[203] In November 1961, he authorized Operation Mongoose (also known as the Cuban Project).[204] In March 1962, Kennedy rejected Operation Northwoods, proposals for false flag attacks against American military and civilian targets,[205] and blaming them on the Cuban government in order to gain approval for a war against Cuba. However, the administration continued to plan for an invasion of Cuba in the summer of 1962.[204]\n\n\n\n#### Cuban Missile Crisis[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cuban Missile Crisis\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nKennedy faced a dilemma: if the U.S. attacked the sites, it might lead to nuclear war with the Soviet Union, but if the U.S. did nothing, it would be faced with the increased threat from close-range nuclear weapons (positioned approximately 90 mi (140 km) away from the Florida coast). The U.S. would also appear to the world as less committed to the defense of the Western Hemisphere. On a personal level, Kennedy needed to show resolve in reaction to Khrushchev, especially after the Vienna summit.[210] To deal with the crisis, he formed an ad hoc body of key advisers, later known as EXCOMM, that met secretly between October 16 and 28.[211]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nKennedy's administration included high tensions with communist states in the Cold War. As a result, he increased the number of American military advisers in South Vietnam. The Strategic Hamlet Program began in Vietnam during his presidency. In April 1961, he authorized an attempt to overthrow the Cuban government of Fidel Castro in the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion. In November 1961, he authorized Operation Mongoose, also aimed at removing the communists from power in Cuba. He rejected Operation Northwoods in March 1962, but his administration continued to plan for an invasion of Cuba in the summer of 1962. The following October, U.S. spy planes discovered Soviet missile bases had been deployed in Cuba. The resulting period of tensions, termed the Cuban Missile Crisis, nearly resulted in the breakout of a global thermonuclear conflict. He also signed the first nuclear weapons treaty in October 1963. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Kennedy confers with Attorney General Robert Kennedy, c. October 1962\nThe U.S. Navy would stop and inspect all Soviet ships arriving off Cuba, beginning October 24. Several Soviet ships approached the blockade line, but they stopped or reversed course to avoid the blockade.[215] The Organization of American States gave unanimous support to the removal of the missiles. Kennedy exchanged two sets of letters with Khrushchev, to no avail.[216] United Nations (UN) Secretary General U Thant requested both parties to reverse their decisions and enter a cooling-off period. Khrushchev agreed, but Kennedy did not.[217] Kennedy managed to preserve restraint when a Soviet missile unauthorizedly downed a U.S. Lockheed U-2 reconnaissance aircraft over Cuba, killing the pilot Rudolf Anderson.[218]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMore than a third of U.S. National Security Council (NSC) members favored an unannounced air assault on the missile sites, but for some of them this conjured up an image of \"Pearl Harbor in reverse.\"[212] There was also some concern from the international community (asked in confidence), that the assault plan was an overreaction in light of the fact that Eisenhower had placed PGM-19 Jupiter missiles in Italy and Turkey in 1958. It also could not be assured that the assault would be 100% effective.[213] In concurrence with a majority-vote of the NSC, Kennedy decided on a naval blockade (or \"quarantine\"). On October 22, after privately informing the cabinet and leading members of Congress about the situation, Kennedy announced on national television the naval blockade and warned that U.S. forces would seize \"offensive weapons and associated materiel\" that Soviet vessels might attempt to deliver to Cuba.[214]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAt the president's direction, Robert Kennedy privately informed Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin that the U.S. would remove the Jupiter missiles from Turkey \"within a short time after this crisis was over.\"[219] On October 28, Khrushchev agreed to dismantle the missile sites, subject to UN inspections.[220] The U.S. publicly promised never to invade Cuba and privately agreed to remove its Jupiter missiles from Italy and Turkey, which were by then obsolete and had been supplanted by submarines equipped with UGM-27 Polaris missiles.[221]\n\n\nThis crisis brought the world closer to nuclear war than at any point before or after. It is considered that \"the humanity\" of both Khrushchev and Kennedy prevailed.[222] The crisis improved the image of American willpower and the president's credibility. Kennedy's approval rating increased from 66% to 77% immediately thereafter.[223]\n\n\n\n#### Latin America and communism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Foreign policy of the John F.

During this time, Robert McNamara was serving as Secretary of Defense and one of John F. Kennedy's trusted advisors. When Kennedy received confirmation of the placement of offensive Soviet missiles in Cuba, he immediately set up the 'Executive Committee', referred to as 'ExComm'. This committee included United States government officials, such as Robert McNamara, advising Kennedy on the crisis. Kennedy instructed ExComm to immediately come up with a response to the Soviet threat unanimously without him present.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962, McNamara served as a member of EXCOMM and played a large role in the Administration's handling and eventual defusing of the Cuban Missile Crisis. He was a strong proponent of the blockade option over a missile strike and helped persuade the Joint Chiefs of Staff to agree with the blockade option.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWith tensions continuing to escalate, it was confirmed[*by whom?*] the crisis had to be resolved within 48 hours when the White House received two messages from Nikita Khrushchev. The first message, an informal one, stated if the United States guaranteed to not invade Cuba then they would take the missiles out. The second message, a more formal one, was broadcast on the radio stating if the United States attacked then Cuba was prepared to retaliate with masses of military power. Although American defense planning focused on using nuclear weapons, Kennedy and McNamara saw it was clear the use of strategic weapons could be suicidal.[36] Following Cuba's aftermath, McNamara stated, \"There is no such thing as strategy, only crisis management.\"[36]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMcNamara became a close adviser to Kennedy and advocated the use of a blockade during the Cuban Missile Crisis. Kennedy and McNamara instituted a Cold War defense strategy of flexible response, which anticipated the need for military responses short of massive retaliation. McNamara consolidated intelligence and logistics functions of the Pentagon into two centralized agencies: the Defense Intelligence Agency and the Defense Supply Agency. During the Kennedy administration, McNamara presided over a build-up of U.S. soldiers in South Vietnam. After the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin incident, the number of U.S. soldiers in Vietnam escalated dramatically. McNamara and other U.S. policymakers feared that the fall of South Vietnam to a Communist regime would lead to the fall of other governments in the region.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHe advised Kennedy against the chiefs, warning that air strikes would almost certainly be metaphorically crossing the Rubicon.[33] McNamara's relations with the hawkish Joint Chiefs of Staff had been strained during the crisis, and his relations with Admiral George Anderson and General Curtis LeMay were especially testy.[34] Both Admiral Anderson and General LeMay had favored invading Cuba, welcomed the prospect of a war with Soviet Union under the grounds that a war with the Soviet Union was inevitable, and whose attitudes towards Kennedy and McNamara had verged on insubordination.[34] Admiral Anderson had at a one point ordered McNamara out of the Naval Operations Room, saying that as a civilian he was unqualified to be making decisions about naval matters, leading McNamara to say that he was the Defense Secretary and Anderson was unqualified to be ordering him to do anything.[34]  \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* *Cuban Missile Crisis Revisited*.

The majority of officials favored an air attack on Cuba in hopes to destroy the missile sites, although the vote was not unanimous which brought them to other alternatives. By the end of the week, ExComm came up with four different alternative strategies to present to the president: a blockade, an air strike, an invasion, or some combination of these.[35] These actions are known as OPLAN 312, OPLAN 314 and OPLAN 316. A quarantine was a way to prevent the Soviets from bringing any military equipment in or out of Cuba.[36] During the final review of both alternatives on Sunday, October 21, upon Kennedy's request, McNamara presented the argument against the attack and for the quarantine. On Wednesday, October 24 at 10:00 am EDT, the quarantine line around Cuba went into effect.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n31. **^** Amadae, SM (2003). \"Chapter 1\". *Rationalizing Capitalist Democracy: The Cold War Origins of Rational Choice Liberalism*.

Rusk was a quiet advisor to Kennedy, rarely making his own views known to other officials. He supported diplomatic efforts during the Cuban Missile Crisis, and, though he initially expressed doubts about the escalation of the U.S. role in the Vietnam War, he became known as one of its strongest supporters. Asked to stay on by President Lyndon Johnson after Kennedy's assassination in 1963, Rusk was known to be a favorite of Johnson's. He left the Secretary role in January 1969, and taught international relations at the University of Georgia School of Law.\n\n\n\n\n## Childhood and education[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Undersecretary of State, Chester Bowles, wrote to Rusk in late March 1961, saying he heard rumors that Cuban emigres were being trained by the CIA for an invasion of Cuba, which he asked Rusk to stop, saying it was against the rules of the Organization of American States.[32] Rusk did not pass on the memo to Kennedy nor did he himself speak out against the Bay of Pigs invasion, even when his own military experience had convinced him that a single brigade \"did not stand a snowball's chance in hell\" of toppling's Cuba's government.[33]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Cabinet\n |\n| --- |\n| Vice President | * Lyndon B.

He stated he would consider adopting it if Rusk gave his approval first.[49] Rusk, who had gone to New York to attend a session of the United Nations, cautiously gave approval out of the impression that Kennedy had approved it first.[49] When it emerged that was not the case, Kennedy assembled his foreign policy team for a stormy meeting at the White House, with several, such as McNamara, Vice President Lyndon Johnson, and CIA director John McCone, all speaking for standing with Diem, while others like the Undersecretary of State George Ball, W. Avrell Harriman and Roger Hilsman argued for deposing Diem. Much to Kennedy's annoyance, Rusk maintained a stony silence, refusing to take a side. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Cabinet\n |\n| --- |\n| Vice President | * *None* (1963–1965)\n* Hubert Humphrey (1965–1969)\n | ![](image)\n |\n| Secretary of State | * Dean Rusk (1963–1969)\n |\n| Secretary of the Treasury | * C.

The Soviets beat the United States with the first crewed spaceflight in April 1961, and Kennedy gave Johnson the task of evaluating the U.S. space program and recommending a project that would allow the United States to catch up or beat the Soviets.[96] Johnson recommended that the United States gain the leadership role by committing to landing an American on the Moon in the 1960s.[97][98] Kennedy assigned priority to the space program, but Johnson's appointment provided cover in case of a failure.[99]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nKennedy, who had become a prominent public critic of the war and loomed as a potential challenger in the 1968 presidential election.[234] Johnson had just received several reports predicting military progress by the summer, and warned Kennedy, \"I'll destroy you and every one of your dove friends in six months\".[235] McNamara offered Johnson a way out of Vietnam in May; the administration could declare its objective in the war—South Vietnam's self-determination—was being achieved and the upcoming September elections in South Vietnam would provide the chance for a coalition government. The United States could reasonably expect that country to then assume responsibility for the election outcome. But Johnson was reluctant, in light of some optimistic reports about the conflict that provided hope of improvement, though those were of questionable reliability. Meantime, the CIA was reporting wide food shortages in Hanoi and an unstable power grid, as well as military manpower reductions.[236]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Cabinet\n |\n| --- |\n| Vice President | * Lyndon B.

Johnson was quite agitated by this recommendation and McNamara's resignation soon followed. Except for George Ball, the \"Wise Men\" all agreed the administration should \"press forward\".[242] Johnson was confident that Hanoi would await the 1968 U.S. election results before deciding to negotiate.[243]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n109. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** terHorst, Jerald F.; Albertazzie, Col.

Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson, the second-longest serving Secretary of State after Cordell Hull from the Franklin Roosevelt administration. He had been a high government official in the 1940s and early 1950s, as well as the head of a leading foundation. He is cited as one of the two officers responsible for dividing the two Koreas at the 38th parallel.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Rusk in his later years.\nJanuary 20, 1969 marked Rusk's last day as Secretary of State, and upon leaving Foggy Bottom he delivered a brief valedictory: \"Eight years ago, Mrs. Rusk and I came quietly. We wish now to leave quietly. Thank you very much\".[126] At a farewell dinner hosted by Dobrynin, the longest-serving ambassador in Washington, Rusk told his host: \"What's done cannot be undone.\"[126] After the dinner, Rusk drove away in a modest car that barely seemed to be working, which Dobrynin considered to an apt symbolic end to the Johnson administration.[126] Upon his return to Georgia, Rusk suffered from a prolonged bout of depression and suffered from psychosomatic illnesses, visiting doctors with complaints of chest and stomach pains that appeared to have no physical basis.[126] Unable to work, Rusk was supported throughout 1969 by the Rockefeller Foundation who paid him a salary as a \"distinguished fellow\".[126]   \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nRusk stated during his time as Secretary of State that he never saw any evidence that the Soviet Union planned to invade Western Europe and he \"seriously doubted\" that it ever would.[131] Cohen noted that in contrast to his years with Kennedy, Rusk was warmer and more protective towards Johnson, whom he clearly got on better with than he ever did with Kennedy.[132]\n\n\nIn a review of *As I Saw It*, the historian George C. Herring wrote that the book was mostly dull and uninformative when it came to Rusk's time as Secretary of State, telling little that historians did not already know, and the most interesting and passionate parts concerned his youth in the \"Old South\" and his conflict and reconciliation with his son Richard.[133]\n\n\nRusk died of heart failure in Athens, Georgia, on December 20, 1994, at the age of 85.[134] He and his wife are buried at the Oconee Hill Cemetery in Athens.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* \"A conversation with Dean Rusk, former U.S. Secretary of State (1961–1969)\" Part of the American Diplomacy and The Lessons of Crisis: Vietnam and the Cold War collections online at Duke University\n* Dean Rusk Oral History Collection, from the Richard B.

Rusk was emotionally exhausted after 8 years as Secretary of State and narrowly survived a nervous breakdown in 1969.[3] Roy Harris, a university regent who served as the Georgia campaign manager for the presidential campaign of George Wallace in 1968, tried to block Rusk's appointment under the ostensible grounds \"We don't want the university to be a haven for broken-down politicians\", but in reality because he was opposed to a man who had allowed his daughter to marry a black man.[126] However, Harris's vote was overruled. Rusk found that the return to teaching in 1970 and the resumption of the academic career he had abandoned in 1940 was emotionally satisfying. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBorn to a poor farm family in Cherokee County, Georgia, Rusk graduated from Davidson College and was a Rhodes Scholar at the University of Oxford, where he immersed himself in English history and customs. After teaching at Mills College in California, he became an army officer in the war against Japan. He served as a staff officer in the China Burma India Theater, becoming a senior aide to Joseph Stilwell, the top American general. As a civilian he became a senior official in 1945 at the State Department, rising to the number three position under Dean Acheson. He became Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs in 1950. In 1952, Rusk left to become president of the Rockefeller Foundation.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Secretary Rusk was portrayed by actor Larry Gates in the 1974 ABC television docudrama *The Missiles of October*, dramatizing the Cuban Missile Crisis of October, 1962.\n* Actor Henry Strozier played Secretary Rusk in another dramatization of the Cuban Missile Crisis *Thirteen Days* (2000), a theatrical film directed by Roger Donaldson.\n* Actor John Aylward played Secretary Rusk in the biographical television film *Path to War* (2002) directed by John Frankenheimer\n\n\n## Publications[edit]\n\n\n* \"U.S. Foreign Policy: A Discussion with Former Secretaries of State Dean Rusk, William P.

He served as a staff officer in the China Burma India Theater. During the war, Rusk had authorized an air drop of arms to the Viet Minh guerrillas in Vietnam commanded by his future enemy Ho Chi Minh.[9] At war's end he was a colonel, decorated with the Legion of Merit with Oak Leaf Cluster.[6]\n\n\n\n### State Department 1945–1953[edit]\n\n\nRusk returned to America to work briefly for the War Department in Washington. He joined the Department of State in February 1945, and worked for the office of United Nations Affairs. In the same year, he suggested splitting Korea into spheres of U.S. and of Soviet influence at the 38th parallel north.[12] After Alger Hiss left State in January 1947, Rusk succeeded him (as director of the Office of Special Political Affairs), according to Max Lowenthal.[13]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n> By process of elimination, and determined to run foreign policy from the White House, Kennedy came to Dean Rusk, the president of the Rockefeller Foundation. Rusk was an acceptable last choice, with the right credentials and the right backers. A Rhodes scholar, a college professor, a World War II officer, an Assistant Secretary of State for the Far East under Truman, a liberal Georgian sympathetic to integration, and a consistent Stevenson supporter, Rusk offended no one. The foreign policy establishment — Acheson, Lovett, liberals Bowles and Stevenson, and *The New York Times* — all sang his praises. But most of all, it was clear to Kennedy from their one meeting in December 1960 that Rusk would be a sort of faceless, faithful bureaucrat who would serve rather than attempt to lead.[24]\n> \n> \n\n\nKennedy tended to address Rusk as \"Mr. Rusk\" instead of Dean.[25]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_kMgPQe7YBXLgrQWFOp90efLo","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

His vice president, Lyndon B. Johnson, assumed the presidency upon Kennedy's death. Lee Harvey Oswald, a former U.S. Marine, was arrested for the assassination, but he was shot and killed by Jack Ruby two days later. The FBI and the Warren Commission both concluded Oswald had acted alone, but conspiracy theories about the assassination still persist. After Kennedy's death, Congress enacted many of his proposals, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Revenue Act of 1964. Kennedy ranks highly in polls of U.S. presidents with historians and the general public. His personal life has also been the focus of considerable sustained interest following public revelations in the 1970s of his chronic health ailments and extramarital affairs. Kennedy is the most recent U.S. president to have died in office.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** \"John F.

Lee Harvey Oswald, an order filler at the Texas School Book Depository from which the shots were fired, was arrested for the murder of police officer J. D. Tippit and was subsequently charged with Kennedy's assassination. He denied shooting anyone, claiming he was a patsy,[367][368] and was shot dead by Jack Ruby on November 24, before he could be prosecuted. Ruby was arrested and convicted for the murder of Oswald. Ruby successfully appealed his conviction and death sentence but became ill and died of cancer on January 3, 1967, while the date for his new trial was being set.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n86. **^** \"Fast Facts about John F.

On Election Day, Kennedy defeated Nixon in one of the closest presidential elections of the 20th century. In the national popular vote, by most accounts, Kennedy led Nixon by just two-tenths of one percent (49.7% to 49.5%), while in the Electoral College, he won 303 votes to Nixon's 219 (269 were needed to win).[154] Fourteen electors from Mississippi and Alabama refused to support Kennedy because of his support for the civil rights movement; they voted for Senator Harry F. Byrd of Virginia, as did an elector from Oklahoma.[154] Forty-three years old, Kennedy was the youngest person ever elected to the presidency (though Theodore Roosevelt was a year younger when, as vice-president, he succeeded to the presidency after the assassination of William McKinley in 1901).[155]\n\n\n\n## Presidency (1961–1963)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Presidency of John F.

She was an accomplished cook, and Robert's favorite dish was reputed to be her beef bourguignon.[209] Margaret McNamara, a former teacher, used her position as a Cabinet spouse to launch a reading program for young children, Reading Is Fundamental, which became the largest literacy program in the country. She died of cancer in 1981.

By 1967, McNamara was suffering visibly from the nervous strain as he went days without shaving and he suffered spasms where his jaw would quiver uncontrollably for hours.[166] Johnson said about him: \"You know, he's a fine man, a wonderful man, Bob McNamara. He has given everything, just about everything, and, you know, we just can't afford another Forrestal\" (a reference to the first Defense Secretary, James Forrestal, who committed suicide due to work-related stress and depression).[166]  \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn September 29, 1972, a passenger on the ferry to Martha's Vineyard recognized McNamara on board and attempted to throw him into the ocean.

He played a major role in promoting the U.S.'s involvement in the Vietnam War.[3] McNamara was responsible for the institution of systems analysis in public policy, which developed into the discipline known today as policy analysis.[4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMcNamara left office on February 29, 1968; for his efforts, the President awarded him both the Medal of Freedom[185] and the Distinguished Service Medal.[186] McNamara's last day as Defense Secretary was a memorable one. The hawkish National Security Adviser, Walt Whitman Rostow, argued at a cabinet meeting that day that the United States was on the verge of winning the war. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara with U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff General Curtis LeMay at The Pentagon on April 10, 1963.

Take it back!\"[141] By 1969, McNamara wanted to forget the Vietnam war and did not want any reminders of his former job.[192]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)President John F. Kennedy and McNamara, 1962After his election in 1960, President-elect John F. Kennedy first offered the post of Secretary of Defense to Robert A. Lovett, who had already served in that position in the Truman administration; Lovett declined but recommended McNamara. Kennedy had read about McNamara and his career in a *Time* magazine article on December 2, 1960, and interviewed him on December 8, with his brother and right-hand man Robert F. Kennedy also being present.[18] McNamara told Kennedy that he didn't know anything about government, to which Kennedy replied: \"We can learn our jobs together. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nRobert McNamara was born in San Francisco, California.[3] His father was Robert James McNamara, sales manager of a wholesale shoe company, and his mother was Clara Nell (Strange) McNamara.[5][6][7] His father's family was Irish and, in about 1850, following the Great Irish Famine, had emigrated to the U.S., first to Massachusetts and later to California.[8] He graduated from Piedmont High School in Piedmont, California in 1933, where he was president of the Rigma Lions boys club[9] and earned the rank of Eagle Scout. McNamara attended the University of California, Berkeley and graduated in 1937 with a B.A. in economics with minors in mathematics and philosophy. He was a member of the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity,[10] was elected to Phi Beta Kappa in his sophomore year, and earned a varsity letter in crew. Before commissioning into the Army Air Force, McNamara was a Cadet in the Golden Bear Battalion at U.C. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nImmediately thereafter, McNamara worked for a year at Price Waterhouse, a San Francisco accounting firm. He returned to Harvard in August 1940 to teach accounting in the Business School and became the institution's highest-paid and youngest assistant professor at that time.[12] Following his involvement there in a program to teach analytical approaches used in business to officers of the United States Army Air Forces, he entered the USAAF as a captain in early 1943, serving most of World War II with its Office of Statistical Control. One of his major responsibilities was the analysis of U.S. bombers' efficiency and effectiveness, especially the B-29 forces commanded by Major General Curtis LeMay in India, China, and the Mariana Islands.[13] McNamara established a statistical control unit for the XX Bomber Command and devised schedules for B-29s doubling as transports for carrying fuel and cargo over The Hump. He left active duty in 1946 with the rank of lieutenant colonel and with a Legion of Merit.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nI don't know how to be president either\".[18] McNamara had read Kennedy's ghostwritten book *Profiles in Courage* and asked him if he had really written it himself, with Kennedy insisting that he did.[18] McNamara's confidence and self-assurance impressed Kennedy.[19] Kennedy offered McNamara the chance to be either Secretary of Defense or Secretary of the Treasury; McNamara came back a week later, accepting the post of Secretary of Defense on the condition of having the right of final approval in all appointments to the Department of Defense, with Kennedy replying: \"It's a deal\".[18] McNamara's salary as the CEO of Ford ran to some $3 million dollars per year while by contrast the position of the Defense Secretary paid only $25,000 per year.[20] Given the financial sacrifices, McNamara was able to insist to Kennedy that he have the right to appoint his officials and run the Pentagon his own way.[21]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_qhcjvXZIGehyaMSHps3HHMN2","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

He was still smoking heavily, and told Cronkite that it was better for his heart \"to smoke than to be nervous\".[278]\n\n\nTen days later, at approximately 3:39 p.m. Central Time on January 22, 1973, Johnson suffered his final heart attack in his bedroom. During his attack, he managed to telephone the Secret Service agents on the ranch, who found him still holding the telephone receiver, unconscious and \"appear[ing] to be dead\".[279] They attempted resuscitation, and Johnson was airlifted in one of his planes to San Antonio International Airport, en route to Brooke Army Medical Center. However, cardiologist and Army colonel George McGranahan pronounced him dead on arrival at the airport at 4:33 p.m. Johnson was 64.[279]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n273. **^** *Decisions That Shook the World*, vol. 1, 38:18–47.

Eulogies were given by former Texas governor Connally and Billy Graham, the minister who officiated at the burial rites. The state funeral, the last for a president until Richard Nixon's in 1994, was part of an unexpectedly busy week in Washington, beginning with Richard Nixon's second inauguration following the 1972 election.[287] As Johnson died only two days after the inauguration,[284][287] the remainder of the ceremonies surrounding the inauguration were cancelled to allow for a full state funeral,[287] and many of the military men who participated in the inauguration took part in the funeral.[287] It also meant that Johnson's casket traveled the entire length of the Capitol, entering through the Senate wing when taken into the Rotunda to lie in state and exiting through the House wing steps due to inauguration construction on the East Front steps.[284]\n\n\n\n## Personality and public image[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPresident of the United States from 1963 to 1969\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Lyndon Johnson\" and \"LBJ\" redirect here.

J. Pickle and former Secretary of State Dean Rusk eulogized him when he lay in state at the Capitol.[283][284] The funeral took place on January 25 at the National City Christian Church in Washington, D.C., where he had often worshiped as president. The service was presided over by President Richard Nixon and attended by foreign dignitaries, led by Eisaku Satō, who had served as Japanese prime minister during Johnson's presidency.[285] Eulogies were given by George Davis, the church's pastor, and W.
