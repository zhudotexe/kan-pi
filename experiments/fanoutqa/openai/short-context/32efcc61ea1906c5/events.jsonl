Post, who took the cereal business seriously, was equipped to market and advertise his products nationwide; so successfully, in fact, that W.K. Kellogg broke away from his brother and in 1907 founded his own company, the Battle Creek Toasted Corn Flake Company (renamed the Kellogg Company in 1922). Kellogg's Corn Flakes eventually overtook Post Toasties in popularity and the latter brand is today only a minor player in the dry-cereal market.\n5. **^** See *International Directory of Company Histories*, Volume 2, pp 530-32, published by St. James Press, 1990, for details relating to the company during this period.\n6. **^** Biographical details of Post's life may be found in *American National Biography*, Volume 7, p. 732.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n40. **^** \"Fortified Oat Flakes Cereal - MrBreakfast.com\". *mrbreakfast.com*.\n41. **^** *Vintage Old 1950s Post Heart of Oats Cereal Commercial*. *YouTube*. 24 July 2013.

Ferdinand Schumacher became president, Henry Crowell the general manager, and John Stuart the secretary-treasurer. In 1889, the American Cereal Company introduced the half-ounce trial size and, as a promotion, distributed one to every home in Portland, Oregon, via boys on bicycles. Later, this promotion was extended to other cities. A second promotion involved placing dinner plates within the then-regular (not round) boxes of oats.\n\n\n\n### Quaker Oats Company[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1879, John Stuart and his son Robert joined with George Douglas to form Imperial Mill and set up their operation in Chicago, Illinois. In 1881, Henry Parsons Crowell bought the Quaker Mill Company;[2] the following year, he launched the first national magazine advertising campaign for breakfast cereal, introducing a cereal box that made it possible to buy in quantities other than bulk. He also bought the bankrupt Quaker Oat Mill Company in Ravenna and held the key positions of general manager, president and chairman of the company from 1888 until late 1943, becoming known as the cereal tycoon.

In 1881, Henry Crowell bought the company and launched a national advertising campaign for Quaker Oats.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1911, the company acquired the Great Western Cereal Company. The iconic cylindrical package was introduced in 1915. Although Quaker Oats Company claims that the \"Quaker man\" is not meant to resemble or represent an actual person, the company identified the Quaker man as William Penn in advertising dating back to 1909. \n\n\nIn 1983, Quaker acquired Stokely-Van Camp, Inc., the maker of Van Camp's and Gatorade. In 2001, PepsiCo bought Quaker Oats for $14 billion, primarily to acquire the Gatorade brand.[1]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Precursor miller companies[edit]\n\n\n![](image)1905 magazine advertisement.\nIn the 1850s, Ferdinand Schumacher and Robert Stuart founded oat mills. Schumacher founded the German Mills American Oatmeal Company in Akron, Ohio, and Stuart founded the North Star Mills in Hearst, Ontario, Rupert's Land. In 1870, Schumacher ran his first known cereal advertisement in the Akron Beacon Journal newspaper. In 1877, the Quaker Mill Company of Ravenna, Ohio, was founded. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1908, Quaker Oats introduced the first in a series of cookie recipes on the box. In 1911, Quaker Oats purchased the Great Western Cereal Company. The iconic cylindrical package made its first appearance in 1915. Later that year, Quaker offered the first cereal box premium to buyers. By sending in one dollar and the cutout picture of the \"Quaker Man\" customers received a double boiler for the cooking of oatmeal. \n\n\nIn the 1920s, Quaker introduced \"Quaker Quick Oats\", an early convenience food, and also offered a crystal radio set built in the same cylindrical canister as Quick Oats, with the same label, for US$1 plus two trademarks cut from Quaker Oats packages.[6] In the 1930s, Quaker was one of the many companies using the Dionne Quintuplets for promotional purposes.[7] Quaker Oats in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, was photographed during the 1930s by Theodor Horydczak, who documented the building, operations, and factory workers at the plant.[8]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_Xp7SuWj58JI0DQsspTqss4Iu","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

Although many plain wheat-, oat- and corn-based cereals exist, many other varieties are highly sweetened, while some brands include freeze-dried fruit as a sweet element. The breakfast cereal industry has gross profit margins of 40‚Äì45%,[2] 90% penetration in some markets,[3] and has had steady and continued growth throughout its history.[4]\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Breakfast cereals primarily marketed to children, such as Froot Loops, are commonly brightly colored and high in sugar.\nAfter World War II, the big breakfast cereal companies‚Äînow including General Mills, who entered the market in 1924 with Wheaties‚Äîincreasingly started to target children. The flour was refined to remove fiber, which at the time was considered to undermine digestion and absorption of nutrients, and sugar was added to improve the flavor for children. The new breakfast cereals began to look starkly different from their ancestors. Ranger Joe, the first pre-sweetened breakfast cereal of sugar-coated puffed wheat or rice, was introduced in the US in 1939.[27] Kellogg's Sugar Smacks, created in 1953, had 56% sugar by weight.[28] Different mascots were introduced, such as the Rice Krispies elves[29] and later pop icons like Tony the Tiger and the Trix Rabbit.\n\n\n\n### Granola[edit]\n\n\nMain article: granola\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 1985, Philip Morris Tobacco Company bought General Foods for $5.6 billion (equivalent to $15.9 billion today) and merged it with its Kraft division.[20] Because of Kellogg and Post, the city of Battle Creek, Michigan, is nicknamed the \"Cereal Capital of the World\".[21]\n\n\n\n### Muesli[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Muesli\n\nMuesli is a breakfast cereal based on uncooked rolled oats, fruit, and nuts. It was developed around 1900 by the Swiss physician Maximilian Bircher-Benner for patients in his hospital.[22] It is available in a packaged dry form such as Alpen or Familia Swiss M√ºesli, or it can be made fresh.\n\n\n\n### United Kingdom[edit]\n\n\nIn 1902, Force wheat flakes became the first ready-to-eat breakfast cereal introduced into the United Kingdom. The cereal, and the Sunny Jim character, achieved wide success in Britain, at its peak in 1930 selling 12.5 million packages in one year.\n\n\n\n### National advertising[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe new firm expanded packaged food sales with heavy advertising, including sponsorship of radio programs such as \"Skippy\", \"Jack Armstrong, The All-American Boy\", and baseball games. Jack Dempsey, Johnny Weissmuller, and others verified the \"Breakfast of Champions\" slogan. By 1941 Wheaties had won 12% percent of the cereal market. Experiments with the puffing process produced Kix, a puffed corn cereal, and Cheerios, a puffed oats cereal. Further product innovation and diversification brought total General Mills sales to over $500 million annually (18% in packaged foods) by the early 1950s.[25][26] In 1944 General Foods launched a marketing campaign for Grape Nuts, focusing on nutritional importance of breakfast.[19]\n\n\n\n### Sugar cereals[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nKellogg began the breakfast cereal marketing and introduced the first in-box prize in the early 1900s.[23] Quaker Oats entered the market with Puffed Rice and Wheat Berries it had introduced at the 1904 World Fair, with raw grains shot with hot compressed air from tubes, popping up to many times their size.[24] They were marketed as a revolution in food science.[23] In the 1920s, national advertising in magazines and radio broadcasts played a key role in the emergence of the fourth big cereal manufacturer, General Mills. In 1921, James Ford Bell, president of a Minneapolis wheat milling firm, began experimenting with rolled wheat flakes. After tempering, steaming, cracking wheat, and processing it with syrup, sugar, and salt, it was prepared in a pressure cooker for rolling and then dried in an electric oven. By 1925, Wheaties had become the \"Breakfast of Champions\". In 1928, four milling companies consolidated as the General Mills Company in Minneapolis. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the 1960s, the modern version of granola was invented and popularized. It evolved from a product called Granula (similar to Grape Nuts) to the recognizable modern form involving at a minimum: sweetened toasted oats, but also possibly: dried fruit, puffed rice, nuts or chocolate.\n\n\n\n### Modern cereal[edit]\n\n\nOver 2016 to 2017, Americans purchased 3.1 billion boxes of cereal, mostly as ready to eat cold cereal.[30] In a $9.8 billion cereal market, cold cereal purchases were 88% of the total (12% for hot cereals), with the overall cereal market declining due to reduced consumption of sugar and dairy products.[30] Kellogg's and General Mills each had 30% of the market share for cold cereals. Honey Nut Cheerios was the leading cold cereal.[30]\n\n\n\n## Processing of grains[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n23. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Severson, Kim (22 February 2016). \"A Short History of Cereal\". *The New York Times*.

In Northern Ireland, the company White's has been milling oats in Tandragee since 1841.[40] England has incorporated porridge in their culture for centuries. Many of the different types of porridge were made specially for the royal family including a type of porridge called \"pea porridge\". This specific dish was made for King Richard II.[35]\n\n\n\n## Research[edit]\n\n\nConsumption of breakfast cereal is under preliminary research for the potential to improve nutrition and affect chronic diseases.[41][42]\nRegular breakfast cereal consumption is associated with less risk of being overweight or obese and high-fiber breakfast cereals are associated with a lower risk of diabetes.[41]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Food portal\n\n\n* Cereal box prize\n* List of breakfast cereal advertising characters\n* List of breakfast cereals\n* List of breakfast topics\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nEarly in the 20th century, the Quaker Oats Company (formed in 1901 to replace the American Cereal Company) ventured into the world market. Schumacher, the innovator; Stuart, the manager and financial leader; and Crowell, the creative merchandiser, advertiser, and promoter, doubled sales every decade. Alexander P. Anderson's steam-pressure method of shooting rice from guns created puffed rice and puffed wheat. Crowell's intensive advertising campaign in the 1920s and 1930s featured promotions with such celebrities as Babe Ruth, Max Baer, and Shirley Temple. Sponsorship of the popular *Rin-Tin-Tin* and *Sergeant Preston of the Yukon* radio shows aided the company's expansion during the depression. Meat rationing during World War II boosted annual sales to $90 million (equivalent to $1.5 billion today), and by 1956 sales topped $277 million ($3.1 billion today). \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSome companies promote their products for the health benefits that come from eating oat-based and high-fiber cereals. In the United States, cereals are often fortified with vitamins but can still lack many of the vitamins needed for a healthy breakfast. A significant proportion of cereals have a high sugar content (\"sugar cereals\" or \"sugary cereals\" in common parlance). These cereals are frequently marketed towards children and often feature a cartoon mascot and may contain a toy or prize.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBy 1964 the firm sold over 200 products, grossed over $500 million ($4.9 billion today), and claimed that eight million people ate Quaker Oats each day. Expansion included the acquisition of Aunt Jemima Mills Company in 1926, which continues as a leading brand of pancake mixes and syrup, the sport drink Gatorade in 1983, and in 1986, the Golden Grain Company, producers of Rice-A-Roni canned lunch food. In 2001 Quaker Oats was itself bought out by PepsiCo.[11]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Early developments[edit]\n\n\nThe first cold breakfast cereal, Granula (not the same as granola), was invented in the United States in 1863 by James Caleb Jackson, operator of Our Home on the Hillside which was later replaced by the Jackson Sanatorium in Dansville, New York. The cereal never became popular, due to the inconvenient necessity of tenderizing the heavy bran and graham nuggets by soaking them overnight.[12][13][14]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_Zduq5Dshl0CDw10gElzr0Kfa","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
