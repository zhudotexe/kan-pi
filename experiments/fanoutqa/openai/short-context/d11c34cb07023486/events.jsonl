The team improved on their 4–12 record in 2014 under former head Coach Rex Ryan. Under new head coach Todd Bowles, they succeeded in matching their previous season’s win count in just five games, starting 4–1. Prior to the season, the Jets made a number of moves, including, re-acquiring Darrelle Revis and Antonio Cromartie, two cornerbacks who were instrumental in the Jets previous defensive success, and obtaining Ryan Fitzpatrick and Brandon Marshall in trades. The team regressed to 5–5, before going on a five-game winning streak, clinching their first winning season since 2010. However, it wasn't enough to make the playoffs, as they lost to the Buffalo Bills in Week 17 and the Pittsburgh Steelers defeated the Cleveland Browns. The Steelers, who also finished 10–6, clinched the final AFC playoff spot over the Jets based on a better record vs. common opponents. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n2015 season of NFL team New York Jets\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| 2015 New York Jets season |\n| --- |\n| Owner | Woody & Christopher Johnson |\n| General manager | Mike Maccagnan |\n| Head coach | Todd Bowles |\n| Home field | MetLife Stadium |\n| Results |\n| Record | 10–6 |\n| Division place | 2nd AFC East |\n| Playoff finish | *Did not qualify* |\n| Pro Bowlers | WR Brandon MarshallCB Darrelle RevisDE Muhammad WilkersonC Nick MangoldRB Chris Ivory |\n| Uniform |\n| ![](image) |\n| * ← 2014\n* **Jets seasons**\n* 2016 →\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n2015 New York Jets Draft\n| RD | Selection | Player | Position | College | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | 6\n | Leonard Williams | Defensive end | USC |  |\n| 2 | 37\n | Devin Smith | Wide receiver | Ohio St. |  |\n| 3 | 70\n | **Traded to the Houston Texans for picks 82, 152, 229, and DeVier Posey.** |\n| 82\n | Lorenzo Mauldin | Outside linebacker | Louisville | **Traded from the Houston Texans for pick 70 along with DeVier Posey** |\n| 4 | 103\n | Bryce Petty | Quarterback | Baylor | **Traded from the Jacksonville Jaguars for pick 104 and 229** |\n| 104\n | **Traded to the Jacksonville Jaguars for pick 103.** |\n| 5 | 142\n | **Traded to the Chicago Bears for WR Brandon Marshall.** |\n| 152\n | Jarvis Harrison | Guard | Texas A&M | **Traded from the Houston Texans for pick 70 along with DeVier Posey.** |\n| 6 | 181\n | **Traded to the Seattle Seahawks for WR Percy Harvin.** |\n| 7 | 223\n | Deon Simon | Defensive tackle | Northwestern State |  |\n| 224\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n42. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Allen, Eric (August 4, 2015). \"Jets Sign WR Williams, Waive WR West\".

The team improved on their 4–12 record in 2014 under former head Coach Rex Ryan. Under new head coach Todd Bowles, they succeeded in matching their previous season’s win count in just five games, starting 4–1. Prior to the season, the Jets made a number of moves, including, re-acquiring Darrelle Revis and Antonio Cromartie, two cornerbacks who were instrumental in the Jets previous defensive success, and obtaining Ryan Fitzpatrick and Brandon Marshall in trades. The team regressed to 5–5, before going on a five-game winning streak, clinching their first winning season since 2010. However, it wasn't enough to make the playoffs, as they lost to the Buffalo Bills in Week 17 and the Pittsburgh Steelers defeated the Cleveland Browns. The Steelers, who also finished 10–6, clinched the final AFC playoff spot over the Jets based on a better record vs. common opponents. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n2015 season of NFL team New York Jets\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| 2015 New York Jets season |\n| --- |\n| Owner | Woody & Christopher Johnson |\n| General manager | Mike Maccagnan |\n| Head coach | Todd Bowles |\n| Home field | MetLife Stadium |\n| Results |\n| Record | 10–6 |\n| Division place | 2nd AFC East |\n| Playoff finish | *Did not qualify* |\n| Pro Bowlers | WR Brandon MarshallCB Darrelle RevisDE Muhammad WilkersonC Nick MangoldRB Chris Ivory |\n| Uniform |\n| ![](image) |\n| * ← 2014\n* **Jets seasons**\n* 2016 →\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Johnson, Woody (December 29, 2014). \"Johnson Official Statement on Idzik and Ryan\".

He holds NFL record for wins.\n![](image)Tony Sparano set NFL record for best 1 season turnaround.\nThe Miami Dolphins are a professional American football franchise based in Miami Gardens, Florida. They are members of the East Division of the American Football Conference (AFC) in the National Football League (NFL). The Dolphins began play in 1966 as an expansion team in the American Football League (AFL), and joined the NFL as part of the AFL–NFL merger. The team has played their home games at Hard Rock Stadium, originally known as Joe Robbie Stadium, Pro Player Stadium, Dolphins Stadium, Dolphin Stadium, Landshark Stadium, and Sun Life Stadium, since 1987.[1] The Dolphins are currently owned by Stephen M. Ross.[2]\n\n\nThere have been thirteen head coaches for the Dolphins franchise. The team's first head coach was George Wilson, who coached for four complete seasons.[3] Don Shula, who coached the Dolphins for 26 consecutive seasons, is the franchise's all-time leader for the most regular-season games coached (392), the most regular-season game wins (257), the most playoff games coached (31), and the most playoff-game wins (17). Shula is also the only Dolphins head coach to win a Super Bowl with the team, winning two. He was named the United Press International (UPI) NFL Coach of the Year twice during his tenure with the Dolphins.[4] Mike McDaniel is the current head coach of the Dolphins since his hiring on February 6, 2022.[5]\n\n\n\n\n## Key[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **#** | Number of coaches[N 1] |\n| **Yrs** | Years coached\n |\n| **First** | First season coached\n |\n| **Last** | Last season coached\n |\n| **GC** | Games Coached\n |\n| **W** | Wins\n |\n| **L** | Loses\n |\n| **T** | Ties\n |\n| **Win%** | Win – Loss percentage\n |\n| 00†\n | Elected into the Pro Football Hall of Fame as a coach\n |\n| 00\\*\n | Spent entire NFL head coaching career with the Dolphins\n |\n\n\n## Coaches[edit]\n\n\n*Note: Statistics are accurate through the end of the 2022 NFL season.*\n\n\n| #\n | Image\n | Name\n | Term[N 2] | Regular season\n | Playoffs\n | Accomplishments\n | Ref.\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Yrs\n | First\n | Last\n | GC\n | W\n | L\n | T\n | Win%\n | GC\n | W\n | L\n |\n| 1\n | ![](image) | George Wilson | 4\n | 1966 | 1969 | 56\n | 15\n | 39\n | 2\n | .286\n | —\n |  | [3] |\n| 2\n | ![](image) | Don Shula † | 26\n | 1970 | 1995 | 392\n | 257\n | 133\n | 2\n | .658\n | 31\n | 17\n | 14\n | **Inducted Pro Football Hall of Fame (1997)**2 Super Bowl championships (VII, VIII)5 AFC championships (1971, 1972, 1973, 1982, 1984)11 AFC East Division Champion (1971, 1972, 1973, 1974, 1979, 1981, 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985, 1991, 1994)19 Playoff Berths2 UPI NFL Coach of the Year (1970, 1972) | [4][6] |\n| 3\n | ![](image) | Jimmy Johnson † | 4\n | 1996 | 1999 | 64\n | 36\n | 28\n | 0\n | .563\n | 5\n | 2\n | 3\n | **Inducted Pro Football Hall of Fame (2020)**3 Playoff Berths | [7] |\n| 4\n | ![](image) | Dave Wannstedt | 5\n | 2000 | 2004[N 3] | 73\n | 42\n | 31\n | 0\n | .575\n | 3\n | 1\n | 2\n | 1 AFC East Division Champion (2000) 2 Playoff Berths | [8] |\n| 5\n |  | Jim Bates\\*\n | 1\n | 2004[N 3] | 7\n | 3\n | 4\n | 0\n | .429\n | —\n |  | [9] |\n| 6\n | ![](image) | Nick Saban\\*\n | 2\n | 2005 | 2006 | 32\n | 15\n | 17\n | 0\n | .469\n | —\n |  | [10] |\n| 7\n | ![](image) | Cam Cameron\\*\n | 1\n | 2007 | 16\n | 1\n | 15\n | 0\n | .063\n | —\n |  | [11] |\n| 8\n | ![](image) | Tony Sparano | 4\n | 2008 | 2011[N 4] | 61\n | 29\n | 32\n | 0\n | .475\n | 1\n | 0\n | 1\n | 1 AFC East Division Champion (2008) 1 Playoff Berth | [12] |\n| 9\n |  | Todd Bowles | 1\n | 2011[N 4] | 3\n | 2\n | 1\n | 0\n | .667\n | —\n |  | [13] |\n| 10\n |  | Joe Philbin | 4\n | 2012 | 2015[N 5] | 52\n | 24\n | 28\n | 0\n | .462\n | —\n |  | [14] |\n| 11\n | ![](image) | Dan Campbell | 1\n | 2015[N 5] | 12\n | 5\n | 7\n | 0\n | .417\n | —\n |  | [15] |\n| 12\n | ![](image) | Adam Gase | 3\n | 2016 | 2018 | 48\n | 23\n | 25\n | 0\n | .479\n | 1\n | 0\n | 1\n | 1 Playoff Berth | [16] |\n| 13\n |  | Brian Flores\\*\n | 3\n | 2019 | 2021 | 49\n | 24\n | 25\n | 0\n | .490\n | —\n |  | [17] |\n| 14\n | ![](image) | Mike McDaniel\\*\n | 1\n | 2022–present\n | 17\n | 9\n | 8\n | 0\n | .529\n | 1\n | 0\n | 1\n | 1 Playoff Berth | [18] |\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** A running total of the number of coaches of the Dolphins.

In 2013, the Titans traveled to Pittsburgh for their season opener against the rival Steelers. They got off to a strong start, scoring a touchdown and 3 field goals for a 16-2 lead, as the Steelers could only manage a safety. In the fourth quarter, the Steelers cut the Titans' lead to 16-9 after they scored a touchdown. However, Tennessee ran out the clock, ensuring themselves a victory. With the convincing win, the Titans started the season at 1-0, but since the Colts beat the Raiders, 21-17, and the Texans later defeated the Chargers, 31-28, Tennessee tied for 1st place in the AFC South, since the Jacksonville Jaguars were humiliated, 28-2, at home by the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\n\n\n#### Week 2: at Houston Texans[edit]\n\n\n**Week Two: Tennessee Titans at Houston Texans – Game summary**\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nTennessee Titans\n |\n| --- |\n| * Founded in 1960\n* Formerly the **Houston Oilers** (1960–1996) and the **Tennessee Oilers** (1997–1998)\n* Based and headquartered in **Nashville, Tennessee**\n |\n| Franchise | * History\n\t+ in Houston\n* Coaches\n* Seasons\n* Players\n* First-round draft picks\n* Starting quarterbacks\n |\n| Stadiums | * Jeppesen Stadium\n* Rice Stadium\n* Houston Astrodome\n* Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium\n* Vanderbilt Stadium\n* **Nissan Stadium**\n |\n| Culture | * Bud Adams\n* Luv Ya Blue\n* T-Rac\n* Cheerleaders\n |\n| Lore | * The Comeback\n* Music City Miracle\n* One Yard Short\n |\n| Rivalries | * Baltimore Ravens\n* Buffalo Bills\n* Dallas Cowboys\n* Houston Texans\n* Jacksonville Jaguars\n* Pittsburgh Steelers\n |\n| Division championships (11) | * 1960\n* 1961\n* 1962\n* 1967\n* 1991\n* 1993\n* 2000\n* 2002\n* 2008\n* 2020\n* 2021\n |\n| Conference championships (1) | * 1999\n |\n| League championships (2) | * 1960\n* 1961\n |\n| Retired numbers | * 1\n* 9\n* 27\n* 34\n* 43\n* 63\n* 65\n* 74\n |\n| Media | * Broadcasters\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe game was the first meeting between the Titans and their former coach, Jeff Fisher, and the first game for the club since the passing of its founder, Bud Adams. For the first time in 7 years, it was also quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick's first return to St. Louis since he was traded from the Rams following the 2006 season. Fitzpatrick played his first 2 seasons in and was drafted 250th overall by St. Louis in 2005. The game lead tied or changed on every score as the Titans erupted to 198 rushing yards and four touchdowns on the ground.

After a scoreless first quarter, Cincinnati trailed early in the second quarter as 49ers QB Shaun Hill got a 3-yard TD run. Afterwards, the Bengals took the lead as kicker Shayne Graham managed to get a 24-yard field goal, while QB Carson Palmer completed a 52-yard TD pass to WR Chris Henry. San Francisco ended the half with Hill completing a 17-yard TD pass to TE Vernon Davis.\n\n\nIn the third quarter, the 49ers increased their lead with kicker Joe Nedney getting a 29-yard and a 38-yard field goal.

The starting Bengals played until the 3rd quarter and scored two touchdowns to end their drought. Shayne Graham was injured on a kickoff during an attempted tackle and did not return to kick any PATs or kickoffs, which meant the Bengals made a conversion attempt on 4th down and attempted a 2-point try. Atlanta's starting team, led by Joey Harrington since Vick's legal troubles will keep him from the team, also managed two touchdowns. The Bengals went on to lose the game.\n\n\nTheir fourth and final game, also their only preseason win, took place on August 31. Neither starting quarterback came prepared to play; though Palmer at least wore his uniform, while Manning dressed up in a Colts polo. Cincinnati scored 14 points in the 3rd quarter, with no score coming from the orange jerseys before or after that quarter. Indianapolis scored 6 in the 4th quarter, falling 8 points short of victory.\n\n\n\n## Personnel[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_EsC6rrHNqpF7KcsRXO1kinFk","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

His offensive coordinator, Bob Bratkowski, remained with the team, but his defensive coordinator from 2007 to 2008, Chuck Bresnahan, was not retained. He was replaced by Mike Zimmer and Jeff FitzGerald replaced Ricky Hunley as linebacker coach.\n\n\n\n### Season theme[edit]\n\n\nTypically Lewis has had a theme for the upcoming season for the team to rally around.

Cincinnati would get the lead in the first quarter as cornerback Leon Hall returned an interception 50 yards for a touchdown which was his first interception of the year. Hall also intercepted two other passes giving him 3 total in the game. RB Cedric Benson carried the ball for a career-high 38 times for a career-high 171 yards. The Bengals would then add onto their lead in the second quarter as quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick completed a 20-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Chris Henry.

In the first quarter, Cincinnati trailed early as Ravens WR Mark Clayton turned a double reverse play into a 42-yard TD run. In the second quarter, the Bengals continued to struggle as kicker Matt Stover gave Baltimore a 21-yard field goal. Cincinnati would reply as kicker Shayne Graham nailed a 43-yard field goal. However, in the third quarter, the Bengals continued to show their dismal defense as Ravens QB Joe Flacco got a 38-yard TD run. In the fourth quarter, the Bengals tried to rally as CB Johnathan Joseph returned a fumble 65 yards for a touchdown.

They tried to improve on their previous output in which they won eight games. Instead, they collapsed and finished the season with a 6–10 record and finished the season with double-digit losses for the first time since 1998. From 2006 onwards the Rams continued to crumble: during the subsequent nine seasons in St. Louis, the team neither made it into the playoffs nor finished with a winning record (though they almost made it into the 2010 playoffs, but lost to the Seahawks in their last game to lose the division). Their 6–42 record between 2007 and 2009 was the worst for such a period by any team between the World War II Chicago Cardinals and the 2015 to 2017 Cleveland Browns.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNFL team season\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| 2005 St. Louis Rams season |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) |\n| Owner | Georgia Frontiere |\n| Head coach | Mike Martz Joe Vitt |\n| Home field | Edward Jones Dome |\n| Results |\n| Record | 6–10 |\n| Division place | 2nd NFC West |\n| Playoff finish | *Did not qualify* |\n| Pro Bowlers | T Orlando PaceWR Torry Holt |\n| * ← 2004\n* **Rams seasons**\n* 2006 →\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn October 10, news broke out that head coach Mike Martz announced he was leaving the team indefinitely after being diagnosed with a bacterial infection. A day before that, he coached his last game in a home loss against Seattle. Joe Vitt took over the sidelines for the rest of the season. Though Martz was medically cleared to return, management refused to let him do so and he was fired the day after the final regular season game.

J. Watt recovering. Houston failed to capitalize on the turnover and punted the ball back to the Redskins. The Texans received the ball at the end of the 3rd quarter before letting the clock run out. With 13:19 left to play, Foster fumbled the ball at the Washington 8. Washington also couldn't capitalize on their turnover following numerous rushing plays that resulted in 4th and 17. After receiving the ball again, Houston \"chewed up\" a lot of clock starting at 8:27 left to play. Following the 2 minute warning, Bullock kicked a 42-yard field goal to extend the Texans' lead to 17–6. The Redskins failed to score on their next possession, giving Houston the ball back with 1:14 left.\n\n\n\n##### Game notes[edit]\n\n\nWith the win, the Texans started their season 1–0 and snapped their franchise-worst 14-game losing streak. This was the first regular season game with Bill O'Brien as the Texans' head coach.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWith their loss against the Colts mathematically eliminating the Texans from the AFC South title, the Texans returned home in hopes of securing a wild card spot in the playoffs. In his first career start since the 2013 season, Case Keenum started as the team's 4th quarterback of the season. Despite driving into the redzone on their first possession, the Texans instead settled on a field goal for an early 3–0 lead. Houston kicked two more field goals before scoring a touchdown (thrown by Arian Foster) to take a halftime lead of 16–0. The Texans held on to win 25–13, keeping their playoff hopes alive.\n\n\n\nGame notes\nAndre Johnson had six receptions for 65 yards in the game and became the 10th player in NFL history to reach 1,000 career receptions (1,002). Johnson passed Hines Ward for ninth-most in NFL history. Kicker Randy Bullock was 6/6 on field goals during the game, for a total of 19 points.\n\n\n\n#### Week 17: vs. Jacksonville Jaguars[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNotably, J. J. Watt becomes the first NFL player to have 2 20-sack seasons, sacking Blake Bortles in the end zone for his first career safety. With the win, despite being eliminated from the playoffs with the Ravens win over the Browns, the Texans finished the season with the largest win increase of 2014 (+7), with a record of 9–7.\n\n\n\n## Standings[edit]\n\n\n### Division[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| AFC South |\n| --- |\n| * view\n* talk\n* edit\n | W | L | T | PCT | DIV | CONF | PF | PA | STK |\n| (4) Indianapolis Colts | 11\n | 5\n | 0\n | .688\n | 6–0\n | 9–3\n | 458\n | 369\n | W1\n |\n| Houston Texans | 9\n | 7\n | 0\n | .563\n | 4–2\n | 8–4\n | 372\n | 307\n | W2\n |\n| Jacksonville Jaguars | 3\n | 13\n | 0\n | .188\n | 1–5\n | 2–10\n | 249\n | 412\n | L1\n |\n| Tennessee Titans | 2\n | 14\n | 0\n | .125\n | 1–5\n | 2–10\n | 254\n | 438\n | L10\n |\n\n\n### Conference[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_X3cWxSKh9XoR9wdrDawp2LM0","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

The Texans had a 4–12 record, losing nine of their final 10 games.[41] This season saw the debut of quarterback Deshaun Watson, whom the Texans selected in the first round with the 12th overall pick in the 2017 NFL Draft.[42] However, Watson's season prematurely ended after he tore his ACL in practice prior to Week 9, which along with injuries to various other players contributed to the team's collapse.[43][44]\n\n\n\n#### 2018 season[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2018 Houston Texans season\n\nOn January 13, 2018, O'Brien received a four-year contract extension.[45]\n\n\nThe Texans started the season 0–3, but then went on a nine-game winning streak and finished atop the division with an 11–5 record.[46] Their season ended when they lost to the Indianapolis Colts in the Wild Card Round by a score of 21–7.[47]\n\n\n\n#### 2019 season[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2019 Houston Texans season\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn January 2013, O'Brien interviewed for the head coaching position with the Cleveland Browns[30] and Philadelphia Eagles. However, he decided to remain at Penn State, stating: \"I'm not a one-and-done guy. I made a commitment to these players at Penn State and that's what I am going to do. I'm not gonna cut and run after one year, that's for sure.\"[31] After two years he decided to leave. \n\n\n\n### Houston Texans[edit]\n\n\n![](image)O'Brien delivering a commencement speech at St. Thomas High School in May 2016\nAfter Houston Texans head coach Gary Kubiak was fired on December 6, 2013, multiple reports stated that O'Brien was interested in returning to the NFL. On December 29, O'Brien met with the Texans for further discussion about the Texans' head coaching job. He was officially introduced as the Texans' head coach on January 2, 2014.[32] The Texans had finished 2–14 in 2013 and owned the first overall selection in the 2014 NFL Draft, which they would use on South Carolina defensive end Jadeveon Clowney.[33]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 2019, the Texans finished with a 10–6 record and captured another division title.[48] The Texans outlasted the Buffalo Bills in the Wild Card Round with a 22–19 victory in overtime, overcoming a 16–0 halftime deficit.[49] They were eliminated in the Divisional round with a 51–31 road loss to the eventual Super Bowl LIV champion Kansas City Chiefs despite a 24–0 lead in the first quarter.[50]\n\n\nOn January 28, 2020, O'Brien was appointed as the Texans' general manager. The Texans had gone the entire 2019 season with the position vacant.[51] During the offseason, O'Brien traded wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins and a fourth-round pick in the 2020 NFL Draft to the Arizona Cardinals for running back David Johnson, a 2020 second-round pick, and a 2021 fourth-round pick, a move that was highly criticized.[52][53]\n\n\n\n#### 2020 season[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2020 Houston Texans season\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Links to related articles\n |\n| --- |\n| | * v\n* t\n* e\nPenn State Nittany Lions head football coaches\n |\n| --- |\n| * George W.

Rivera previously served as the Panthers head coach from 2011 to 2019, led the team to a franchise-best 15-1 record en route to Super Bowl 50 in the 2015 season, and is the franchise's winningest head coach, having won 76 games with the team. Both teams traded a pair of touchdowns in the first half, with Newton throwing for a touchdown while rushing for another while Taylor Heinicke threw for two touchdowns. Washington took their first lead in the third quarter with Heinicke's throwing a touchdown to DeAndre Carter. After the Panthers tied it early in the fourth quarter, Washington got back-to-back field goals from Joey Slye. The Panthers' last shot to win the game was denied when Cam Newton got sacked on fourth down. With the win, Washington won back-to-back games for the first time in the season and improved to 4-6.\n\n\n\n#### Week 12: vs. Seattle Seahawks[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWashington hosted the 3–7 Seahawks with both teams needing a win to stay relevant in the NFC playoff picture. Washington kicker Joey Slye was injured on a blocked extra point that was returned for a defensive 2-point conversion by Seahawks defensive tackle Rasheem Green. A touchdown pass late in the 4th quarter on 4th and goal from Heinicke to Logan Thomas was overturned, giving Seattle a chance down 8; while Wilson hit Freddie Swain for a score with 15 seconds left, Kendall Fuller intercepted the 2-point pass to keep Washington with a 17–15 lead. Initially, Seattle appeared to recover an onside kick, but the play was called back due to an illegal formation, and Washington was able to recover the subsequent onside kick attempt to seal the victory and improve to 5–6. It was their first Monday Night Football victory since 2014.\n\n\n\n#### Week 13: at Las Vegas Raiders[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Washington vs. the Las Vegas Raiders\n**Week 13: Washington Football Team at Las Vegas Raiders – Game summary**\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | Bank of America Stadium | Recap |\n| 12 | November 29 | Seattle Seahawks | **W** 17–15\n | 5–6\n | FedExField\n | Recap |\n| 13 | December 5\n | at Las Vegas Raiders | **W** 17–15\n | 6–6\n | Allegiant Stadium | Recap |\n| 14 | December 12\n | **Dallas Cowboys** | **L** 20–27\n | 6–7\n | FedExField\n | Recap |\n| 15 | December 21 | at **Philadelphia Eagles** | **L** 17–27\n | 6–8\n | Lincoln Financial Field | Recap |\n| 16 | December 26\n | at **Dallas Cowboys** | **L** 14–56\n | 6–9\n | AT&T Stadium | Recap |\n| 17 | January 2\n | **Philadelphia Eagles** | **L** 16–20\n | 6–10\n | FedExField\n | Recap |\n| 18 | January 9\n | at **New York Giants** | **W** 22–7\n | 7–10\n | MetLife Stadium | Recap |\n\n\n**Note:** Intra-division opponents are in **bold** text.\n\n\n\n### Game summaries[edit]\n\n\n#### Week 1: vs. Los Angeles Chargers[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Washington vs. the Los Angeles Chargers\n**Week 1: Los Angeles Chargers at Washington Football Team – Game summary**\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Washington vs. the Seattle Seahawks\n**Week 12: Seattle Seahawks at Washington Football Team – Game summary**\n\n\n\n| Period | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | Total |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Seahawks | 7 | 2 | 0 | 6 | **15** |\n| **Washington** | 3 | 6 | 8 | 0 | **17** |\n\n\n*at FedExField, Landover, Maryland*\n\n\n\n* **Date**: November 29\n* **Game time**: 8:15 p.m. EST\n* **Game weather**: Cloudy, 38 °F (3 °C)\n* **Game attendance**: 52,680\n* **Referee**: Clay Martin\n* **TV announcers (ESPN)**: Steve Levy, Brian Griese, Louis Riddick, Lisa Salters and John Parry\n* Preview, Game Book\n\n\n\n| Game information\n |\n| --- |\n| |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **First quarter**\n* WAS – Joey Slye 23-yard field goal, 2:59. *Football Team 3–0. **Drive: 15 plays, 68 yards, 9:25.***\n* SEA – Gerald Everett 6-yard pass from Russell Wilson (Jason Myers kick), 0:20. *Seahawks 7–3. **Drive: 6 plays, 75 yards, 2:39.***\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Period | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | Total |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Washington** | 7 | 0 | 0 | 10 | **17** |\n| Raiders | 0 | 3 | 3 | 9 | **15** |\n\n\n*at Allegiant Stadium, Paradise, Nevada*\n\n\n\n* **Date**: December 5\n* **Game time**: 4:05 p.m. EST/1:05 p.m. PST\n* **Game weather**: None (indoor stadium)\n* **Game attendance**: 61,607\n* **Referee**: Adrian Hill\n* **TV announcers (Fox)**: Kevin Burkhardt, Greg Olsen and Pam Oliver\n* Recap, Game Book\n\n\n\n| Game information\n |\n| --- |\n| |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **First quarter**\n* WAS – Logan Thomas 7-yard pass from Taylor Heinicke (Brian Johnson kick), 9:39. *Football Team 7–0. **Drive: 9 plays, 75 yards, 5:21.***\n\n**Second quarter**\n* LV – Daniel Carlson 52-yard field goal, 0:04. *Football Team 7–3. **Drive: 10 plays, 46 yards, 1:37.***\n\n**Third quarter**\n* LV – Daniel Carlson 38-yard field goal, 4:52. *Football Team 7–6. **Drive: 8 plays, 71 yards, 3:26.***\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n5. **^** Fortier, Sam (September 1, 2020). \"Washington acquires offensive tackle David Sharpe in trade with Raiders\". *Washington Post*.

Week 11 was originally the two teams' bye week. Week 1 would become the bye week for both teams and they would not play until Week 2. This was first time since the Arizona Cardinals in 2001 in which a team had a bye week in Week 1.\n\n\nThe Buccaneers were hampered with poor performance and an early kicking situation, as they failed to improve or match their 9–7 record from the previous season. After a loss to the Detroit Lions on December 10, 2017, they were mathematically eliminated from the playoffs with a 4–9 record. The Bucs finished the season 5-11. This was their tenth consecutive season without a playoff appearance, with their last being in the 2007 season. Also, the Bucs finished last in the NFC South for the seventh time in nine seasons.\n\n\nThe preseason was documented on HBO's *Hard Knocks*.\n\n\n\n\n## Offseason[edit]\n\n\n### Signings[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nTampa Bay Buccaneers\n |\n| --- |\n| * Founded in 1976\n* Based and headquartered in **Tampa, Florida**\n |\n| Franchise | * Franchise\n* Seasons\n* History\n* Coaches\n* Players\n* Expansion draft\n* First-round draft picks\n* Draft history\n* Starting quarterbacks\n* Broadcasters\n |\n| Stadiums | * Tampa Stadium\n* **Raymond James Stadium**\n |\n| Culture | * Hugh Culverhouse\n* Malcolm Glazer\n* Tampa 2\n* Captain Fear\n* *A Triumph of the Heart: The Ricky Bell Story*\n |\n| Lore | * Snow Bowl\n* Tom Brady's return to New England\n |\n| Rivalries | * Carolina Panthers\n* Green Bay Packers\n* Miami Dolphins\n* New Orleans Saints\n |\n| Wild card berths (4) | * 1997\n* 2000\n* 2001\n* 2020\n |\n| Division championships (9) | * 1979\n* 1981\n* 1999\n* 2002\n* 2005\n* 2007\n* 2021\n* 2022\n* 2023\n |\n| Conference championships (2) | * 2002\n* 2020\n |\n| League championships (2) | * 2002 (XXXVII)\n* 2020 (LV)\n |\n| Hall of Famers | * Lee Roy Selmon\n* Steve Young\n* Randall McDaniel\n* Warren Sapp\n* Derrick Brooks\n* Tim Brown\n* John Lynch\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Bucs finish the season with a win against a division rival.

Ryan Fitzpatrick started as quarterback and led the Buccaneers to a 48–40 victory over division rival New Orleans. The 48 points scored tied a franchise record for most points scored in a game, with the Bucs also scoring 48 points in Super Bowl XXXVII. Also, the combined score of 88 points from both teams set an NFL record for the most points scored in Week 1. Fitzpatrick threw for 417 yards and 4 touchdown passes, and ran for another touchdown. The scoring frenzy started early after the Saints scored a touchdown on their first drive. The Buccaneers answered with a 58-yard touchdown reception by DeSean Jackson, followed by a 3-yard touchdown run by Fitzpatrick, for a 14–10 lead at the end of the first quarter. In the third quarter, Mike Evans caught a 50-yard touchdown, the second touchdown pass of 50 or more yards. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Ron Wolf\n* Tony Dungy\n* Ronde Barber\n |\n| Retired numbers | * 55\n* 63\n* 99\n |\n| Current league affiliations | * League: National Football League\n* Conference: National Football Conference\n* Division: South Division\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nTampa Bay Buccaneers seasons\n |\n| --- |\n| * 1976\n* 1977\n* 1978\n* 1979\n* 1980\n* 1981\n* 1982\n* 1983\n* 1984\n* 1985\n* 1986\n* 1987\n* 1988\n* 1989\n* 1990\n* 1991\n* 1992\n* 1993\n* 1994\n* 1995\n* 1996\n* 1997\n* 1998\n* 1999\n* 2000\n* 2001\n* **2002**\n* 2003\n* 2004\n* 2005\n* 2006\n* 2007\n* 2008\n* 2009\n* 2010\n* 2011\n* 2012\n* 2013\n* 2014\n* 2015\n* 2016\n* 2017\n* 2018\n* 2019\n* **2020**\n* 2021\n* 2022\n* 2023\n* 2024\n |\n| **Bold** indicates Super Bowl victory\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDespite leading 17-0 shortly before halftime, the Buccaneers lost the lead and fell 20-31 by the fourth quarter. Although they scored twice in the fourth quarter, two failed two-point conversions only gave them a 32-31 lead, and a 37-yard Matt Bryant field goal sealed the 32-34 loss. This loss dropped the Buccaneers to 5-11 and fourth in the NFC South for the second year in a row.\n\n\n\n### Standings[edit]\n\n\n#### Division[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| NFC South |\n| --- |\n| * view\n* talk\n* edit\n | W | L | T | PCT | DIV | CONF | PF | PA | STK |\n| (1) New Orleans Saints | 13\n | 3\n | 0\n | .813\n | 4–2\n | 9–3\n | 504\n | 353\n | L1\n |\n| Atlanta Falcons | 7\n | 9\n | 0\n | .438\n | 4–2\n | 7–5\n | 414\n | 423\n | W3\n |\n| Carolina Panthers | 7\n | 9\n | 0\n | .438\n | 2–4\n | 5–7\n | 376\n | 382\n | W1\n |\n| Tampa Bay Buccaneers | 5\n | 11\n | 0\n | .313\n | 2–4\n | 4–8\n | 396\n | 464\n | L4\n |\n\n\n#### Conference[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_uMN22GcwpGH6iJ0MV1bC6wcf","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
