It is the sixth television series in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) to be produced by Marvel Studios, sharing continuity with the films of the franchise.

Marvel had approached him \"out of the blue\" to present a pitch for *Moon Knight*,[55] which includes Egyptian mythology and characters that the superhero is associated with in the comics. Diab and his writer-producer wife Sarah Goher put together a 200-page document outlining their vision for the series, which included their intention to depict Egypt and Egyptian people in a more positive way than they felt had been done in previous Hollywood productions. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nQR codes were included in the first two and final two episodes linking viewers to a website to access free digital comics featuring Moon Knight that updated weekly.[138][139] The comics released for the six episodes, in order, were *Werewolf by Night* #32 and #33, *Moon Knight* vol. 1 #3, *Universe X* #6, *Moon Knight* vol. 1 #1, and *Moon Knight Annual* vol. 2 #1.[140][141][142] Each had a connection to a character or visual reference that appeared in that week's episode. By the release of the finale, Disney announced the site was visited over 1.5 million times, with 500,000 full comics read. Adam B. Vary of *Variety* called the initiative \"a savvy way to expand viewers' comic book knowledge\" for the more obscure character of Moon Knight. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe \"Marvel Must Haves\" merchandise program, which reveals new toys, games, books, apparel, home decor, and other merchandise related to each episode of *Moon Knight* following an episode's release, started for the episodes on April 1 and concluded on May 5, 2022.[135][136] Also in April, Marvel and National Geographic released a featurette exploring how the series approached and researched all of the Ancient Egyptian iconography for the sets and story.[137]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n45. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Mohan, Monita (April 21, 2022). \"'Moon Knight' Episode 4's Asylum Scene Explained: Is It All a Dream?\". *Collider*.

Clayton Davis at *Variety* noted that this change could force the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences to reject *Moon Knight* in the limited series categories given their rules and use of past social media and interviews in determining eligibility, necessitating the studios to submit the series in the drama categories,[166] along with *Loki*.[165] Despite this, Davis noted *Moon Knight* was still planned to be submitted in the limited series categories,[166] which Disney and Marvel ultimately did.[167]\n\n\n\n## Documentary special[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *Marvel Studios: Assembled*\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n16. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** Vary, Adam B.

Marvel had approached him \"out of the blue\" to present a pitch for *Moon Knight*,[55] which includes Egyptian mythology and characters that the superhero is associated with in the comics. Diab and his writer-producer wife Sarah Goher put together a 200-page document outlining their vision for the series, which included their intention to depict Egypt and Egyptian people in a more positive way than they felt had been done in previous Hollywood productions. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n16. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** Vary, Adam B.

Marvel had approached him \"out of the blue\" to present a pitch for *Moon Knight*,[55] which includes Egyptian mythology and characters that the superhero is associated with in the comics. Diab and his writer-producer wife Sarah Goher put together a 200-page document outlining their vision for the series, which included their intention to depict Egypt and Egyptian people in a more positive way than they felt had been done in previous Hollywood productions. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n16. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** Vary, Adam B.

Marvel had approached him \"out of the blue\" to present a pitch for *Moon Knight*,[55] which includes Egyptian mythology and characters that the superhero is associated with in the comics. Diab and his writer-producer wife Sarah Goher put together a 200-page document outlining their vision for the series, which included their intention to depict Egypt and Egyptian people in a more positive way than they felt had been done in previous Hollywood productions. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nCurtis was hopeful the project would continue for other MCU films and series.[138] Viewers who scanned the code were also sent an exclusive, digital poster after the series finale of the \"SPKTR\" license plate.[143]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n*Moon Knight* debuted on Disney+ on March 30, 2022.[144] It consists of six episodes,[54] releasing weekly until May 4.[145] A special screening occurred on March 16 at Cine Capitol in Madrid,[146] and on March 17 at the British Museum in London,[147] with the red carpet premiere on March 22 at El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles.[148][149] It is part of Phase Four of the MCU.[150]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Audience viewership[edit]\n\n\nParrot Analytics, which looks at consumer engagement in consumer research, streaming, downloads, and on social media, reported that *Moon Knight* had the most in-demand United States series premiere in the first quarter of 2022.
