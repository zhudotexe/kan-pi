The combined population of both China and India are estimated to be over 2.8 billion people as of 2022[update].\nAsia's population is projected to grow to 5.25 billion by 2055, or about 54% of projected world population at that time.[1] Population growth in Asia was close to 0.55% p.a. as of 2022[update], with highly disparate rates. Many Western Asian and South Asian countries have growth rates above world average, notably Pakistan at 2% p.a., while China had a small decrease of -0.06% and India had a 0.6% increase in 2022. \n\n\n\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Asian countries by population and List of Asian countries by life expectancy\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n#### Shares of World Population, Asia, 1\u20131998 A.D.

In some African states, more than half the population is under 25 years of age.[176] The total number of people in Africa increased from 229 million in 1950 to 630\u00a0million in 1990.[177] As of 2021, the population of Africa is estimated at 1.4 billion [1][2]. Africa's total population surpassing other continents is fairly recent; African population surpassed Europe in the 1990s, while the Americas was overtaken sometime around the year 2000; Africa's rapid population growth is expected to overtake the only two nations currently larger than its population, at roughly the same time \u2013 India and China's 1.4\u00a0billion people each will swap ranking around the year 2022.[178] This increase in number of babies born in Africa compared to the rest of the world is expected to reach approximately 37% in the year 2050; while in 1990 sub-Saharan Africa accounted for only 16% of the world's births.[179]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n**Africa** is the world's second-largest and second-most populous continent, after Asia in both aspects. At about 30.3\u00a0million km2 (11.7\u00a0million square\u00a0miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 20% of Earth's land area and 6% of its total surface area.[7] With 1.4 billion people[1][2] as of 2021, it accounts for about 18% of the world's human population. Africa's population is the youngest amongst all the continents;[8][9] the median age in 2012 was 19.7, when the worldwide median age was 30.4.[10] Despite a wide range of natural resources, Africa is the least wealthy continent per capita and second-least wealthy by total wealth, ahead of Oceania. Scholars have attributed this to different factors including geography, climate, tribalism,[11] colonialism, the Cold War,[12][13] neocolonialism, lack of democracy, and corruption.[11] Despite this low concentration of wealth, recent economic expansion and the large and young population make Africa an important economic market in the broader global context.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n172. **^** China tightens grip on Africa with $4.4bn lifeline for Guinea junta.

The precise figure depends on the exact definition of the geographic extent of Europe. The population of the European Union (EU) was 509 million as of 2015.[10] Non-EU countries situated in Europe in their entirety[11] account for another 90 million. Five transcontinental countries[12] have a total of 247 million people, of which about half reside in Europe proper.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPopulation, age, religion, etc., of Europe\n\n\n\n\n\n![](image)Population density in the European Union and the EFTA countries, along with candidate countries (2017)\n![](image)Population growth in 2021\nFigures for the **population of Europe** vary according to the particular definition of Europe's boundaries.

If demographic trends keep their pace, its share may fall to around 7% in 2050, but still amounting to 716 million people in absolute numbers, according to the United Nations estimate.[9] (The decline in the percentage is partly due to high fertility rates in Africa and South America.) The sub-replacement fertility and high life expectancy in most European states mean a declining and aging population. High immigration and emigration levels within and from outside the continent are taking place and quickly changing countries, specifically in Western Europe, from a single ethnic group to a multicultural society. These trends change societies' economies as well as their political and social institutions.

Most of Europe is in a mode of sub-replacement fertility, which means that each new(-born) generation is less populous than the one before.[3] Nonetheless, most West European countries still have growing populations, mainly due to immigration within Europe and from outside Europe and some due to increases in life expectancy and population momentum. Some current and past factors in European demography have included emigration, ethnic relations, economic immigration, a declining birth rate and an ageing population.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: World population estimates \u00a7\u00a0By world region\n\nSee also: Medieval demography\n\nAccording to Volker Heyd, an archaeologist at the University of Helsinki, up to 7 million people lived in Europe in 3000 BC.[4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Eurostat \u2013 Population and population change statistics (Note that this only covers present and projected future population.)\n* Eurostat \u2013 Population projections\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPopulation by year (in thousands)\n| Country/region\n | 1\n | 1000\n | 1500\n | 1600\n | 1700\n | 1820\n | 1870\n | 1913\n | 1950\n | 1973\n | 1998[6] | 2020\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Austria | 500 | 700 | 2000 | 2500 | 2500 | 3369 | 4520 | 6767 | 6935 | 7586 | 8078 | 8901 |\n| Belgium | 300 | 400 | 1400 | 1600 | 2000 | 3424 | 5096 | 7666 | 8640 | 9738 | 10197 | 11493 |\n| Denmark | 180 | 360 | 600 | 650 | 700 | 1155 | 1888 | 2983 | 4269 | 5022 | 5303 | 5823 |\n| Finland | 20 | 40 | 300 | 400 | 400 | 1169 | 1754 | 3027 | 4009 | 4666 | 5153 | 5536 |\n| France | 5000 | 6500 | 15000 | 18500 | 21471 | 31246 | 38440 | 41463 | 41836 | 52118 | 58805 | 67287 |\n| Germany | 3000 | 3500 | 12000 | 16000 | 15000 | 24905 | 39231 | 65058 | 68371 | 78956 | 82029 | 83191 |\n| Italy | 7000 | 5000 | 10500 | 13100 | 13300 | 20176 | 27888 | 37248 | 47105 | 54751 | 57592 | 59258 |\n| Netherlands | 200 | 300 | 950 | 1500 | 1900 | 2355 | 3615 | 6164 | 10114 | 13438 | 15700 | 17425 |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPopulation and area of European countries/territories\n| Country (or territory)\n | Population[1][2] | Area(km2)[14] | Density(per km2) | Capital |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Albania\u202f\\* | 2,854,710 | 28,748 | 99 | Tirana |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Andorra\u202f\\* | 79,034 | 468 | 169 | Andorra la Vella |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Armenia\u202f\\* | 2,790,974 | 29,743 | 94 | Yerevan |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Austria\u202f\\* | 8,922,082 | 83,871 | 106 | Vienna |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Azerbaijan\u202f\\* | 10,312,992 | 86,600 | 119 | Baku |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Belarus\u202f\\* | 9,578,167 | 207,600 | 46 | Minsk |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Belgium\u202f\\* | 11,611,419 | 30,528 | 380 | Brussels |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Bosnia and Herzegovina\u202f\\* | 3,270,943 | 51,209 | 64 | Sarajevo |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Bulgaria\u202f\\* | 6,520,314 | 110,900 | 59 | Sofia |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Croatia\u202f\\* | 4,060,135 | 56,594 | 72 | Zagreb |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Cyprus\u202f\\* | 1,244,188 | 9,251 | 134 | Nicosia |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Czech Republic\u202f\\* | 10,510,751 | 78,866 | 133 | Prague |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Denmark\u202f\\* | 5,854,240 | 43,094 | 136 | Copenhagen |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAccording to another survey about Religiosity in the European Union from 2012 by Eurobarometer, Christianity was the largest religion in the Union (accounting for 72% of the total population), Catholics were with 48% the largest Christian group in the Union, Protestants made up 12%, Eastern Orthodox made up 8% and other Christians accounted for 4% of the total population.[29] non-believers/agnostics accounted for 16%, atheists accounted for 7% and Muslims accounted for 2%.[30]\n\n\n\n## Ethnic groups[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ethnic groups in Europe\n\nFurther information: White people and Immigration to Europe\n\nPan and Pfeil (2004) count 87 distinct \"**peoples of Europe**\", of which 33 form the majority population in at least one sovereign state, while the remaining 54 constitute ethnic minorities.

The second largest country is Mexico with a population of 112.3 million.[117] Canada is the third most populous country with 37.0 million.[118] The majority of Caribbean island-nations have national populations under a million, though Cuba, Dominican Republic, Haiti, Puerto Rico (a territory of the U.S.), Jamaica, and Trinidad and Tobago each have populations higher than a million.[119][120][121][122][123] Greenland has a small population of 55,984 for its massive size (2,166,000\u00a0km2 or 836,300\u00a0mi2), and therefore, it has the world's lowest population density at 0.026 pop./km2 (0.067 pop./mi2).[124]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNorth America covers an area of about 24,709,000 square kilometers (9,540,000 square miles), representing approximately 16.5% of the Earth's land area and 4.8% of its total surface area. It is the third-largest continent by size after Asia and Africa, and the fourth-largest continent by population after Asia, Africa, and Europe. As of 2013[update], North America's population was estimated at nearly 579 million people in 23 independent states, or about 7.5% of the world's population. In human geography and in the English-speaking world outside the United States, particularly in Canada, the terms \"North America\" and \"North American\" are typically defined as including just Canada and the United States.[6][7][8][9][10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNorth America| ![](image) |\n| Area | 24,709,000\u00a0km2 (9,540,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) (3rd) |\n| Population | 592,296,233 (2021; 4th) |\n| Population density | 25.7/km2 (66.4/sq\u00a0mi) (2021)[a] |\n| GDP (PPP) | $30.61 trillion (2022 est.; 2nd)[1] |\n| GDP (nominal) | $29.01 trillion (2022 est.; 2nd)[2] |\n| GDP per capita | $57,410 (2022 est.; 2nd)[3] |\n| Religions | * Christianity (74.6%)[4]\n* No religion (19.2%)[4]\n* Judaism (1.6%)[4]\n* Islam (1.3%)[4]\n* Buddhism (1.2%)[4]\n* Hinduism (0.8%)[4]\n* Other (1.3%)[4]\n |\n| Demonym | North American |\n| Countries | 23 sovereign states |\n| Dependencies | 23 non-sovereign territories |\n| Languages | English, Spanish, French, Dutch, Danish, indigenous languages, and many others |\n| Time zones | UTC\u221210:00 to UTC\u00b100:00 |\n| Largest cities | List of urban areas:[5]* Mexico City\n* New York City\n* Los Angeles\n* Chicago\n* Boston\n* Toronto\n* Dallas\u2013Fort Worth\n* San Francisco Bay Area\n* Houston\n* Miami\n* Philadelphia\n |\n| UN M49 code | `003` \u2013 North America`019` \u2013 Americas`001` \u2013 Earth |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Rank\n | Country or territory\n | GDP (nominal, peak year)millions of USD | Peak year\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | ![](image)\u00a0United States | 26,949,643 | 2023\n |\n| 2 | ![](image)\u00a0Canada[135] | 2,139,840 | 2022\n |\n| 3 | ![](image)\u00a0Mexico | 1,811,468 | 2023\n |\n| 4 | ![](image)\u00a0Cuba[136] | 545,218 | 2021\n |\n| 5 | ![](image)\u00a0Dominican Republic | 120,629 | 2023\n |\n| 6 | ![](image)\u00a0Puerto Rico | 117,515 | 2023\n |\n| 7 | ![](image)\u00a0Guatemala | 102,765 | 2023\n |\n| 8 | ![](image)\u00a0Costa Rica | 85,590 | 2023\n |\n| 9 | ![](image)\u00a0Panama | 82,348 | 2023\n |\n| 10 | ![](image)\u00a0El Salvador | 35,339 | 2023\n |\n\n\nNorth America's GDP per capita was evaluated in October 2016 by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to be $41,830, making it the richest continent in the world,[137] followed by Oceania.[138]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWhile the U.S., Canada, and Mexico maintain the largest populations, large city populations are not restricted to those nations. There are also large cities in the Caribbean. The largest cities in North America, by far, are Mexico City and New York City. These cities are the only cities on the continent to exceed eight million, and two of three in the Americas. Next in size are Los Angeles, Toronto,[125] Chicago, Havana, Santo Domingo, and Montreal. Cities in the Sun Belt regions of the U.S., such as those in Southern California and Houston, Phoenix, Miami, Atlanta, and Las Vegas, are experiencing rapid growth. These causes included warm temperatures, retirement of Baby Boomers, large industry, and the influx of immigrants. Cities near the U.S. border, particularly in Mexico, are also experiencing large amounts of growth. Most notable is Tijuana, a city bordering San Diego that receives immigrants from all over Latin America and parts of Europe and Asia. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe top ten largest North American metropolitan areas by population as of 2013, based on national census numbers from the U.S. and census estimates from Canada and Mexico\n| **Metro Area** | **Population** | **Area** | **Country** |\n| Mexico City | 21,163,226\u2020 | 7,346\u00a0km2 (2,836\u00a0sq\u00a0mi)\n | Mexico\n |\n| New York City | 19,949,502\n | 17,405\u00a0km2 (6,720\u00a0sq\u00a0mi)\n | United States\n |\n| Los Angeles | 13,131,431\n | 12,562\u00a0km2 (4,850\u00a0sq\u00a0mi)\n | United States\n |\n| Chicago | 9,537,289\n | 24,814\u00a0km2 (9,581\u00a0sq\u00a0mi)\n | United States\n |\n| Dallas\u2013Fort Worth | 6,810,913\n | 24,059\u00a0km2 (9,289\u00a0sq\u00a0mi)\n | United States\n |\n| Houston | 6,313,158\n | 26,061\u00a0km2 (10,062\u00a0sq\u00a0mi)\n | United States\n |\n| Toronto | 6,054,191\u2020 | 5,906\u00a0km2 (2,280\u00a0sq\u00a0mi)\n | Canada\n |\n| Philadelphia | 6,034,678\n | 13,256\u00a0km2 (5,118\u00a0sq\u00a0mi)\n | United States\n |\n| Washington, DC | 5,949,859\n | 14,412\u00a0km2 (5,565\u00a0sq\u00a0mi)\n | United States\n |\n| Miami | 5,828,191\n | 15,896\u00a0km2 (6,137\u00a0sq\u00a0mi)\n | United States\n |\n\n\n\u20202011 Census figures\n\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The percentage of people who identify with a religion in North America, according to 2010\u20132012 data\nChristianity is the largest religion in the United States, Canada, and Mexico.

Its population as of 2021[update] has been estimated at more than 434 million.[1][2] South America ranks fourth in area (after Asia, Africa, and North America) and fifth in population (after Asia, Africa, Europe, and North America). Brazil is by far the most populous South American country, with almost half of the continent's population, followed by Colombia, Argentina, Venezuela and Peru. In recent decades, Brazil has also generated half of the continent's GDP and has become the continent's first regional power.[9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSouth American cities\n![](image)\nS\u00e3o Paulo\n![](image)\nBuenos Aires\n![](image)\nRio de Janeiro\n![](image)\nSantiago\n\nThe most populous country in South America is Brazil with 214.3 million people. The second largest country is Colombia with a population of 51,516,562. Argentina is the third most populous country with 45,276,780.\n\n\nWhile Brazil, Argentina, and Colombia maintain the largest populations, large city populations are not restricted to those nations. The largest cities in South America, by far, are S\u00e3o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Buenos Aires, Santiago, Lima, and Bogot\u00e1. These cities are the only cities on the continent whose metropolitan areas' population exceed eight million. Next in size are Caracas, Belo Horizonte, and Medellin.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSouth America has a population of over 428 million people. They are distributed as to form a \"hollow continent\" with most of the population concentrated around the margins of the continent.[70] On one hand, there are several sparsely populated areas such as tropical forests, the Atacama Desert and the icy portions of Patagonia. On the other hand, the continent presents regions of high population density, such as the great urban centers. The population is formed by descendants of Europeans (mainly Spaniards, Portuguese and Italians), Africans and Amerindians. There is a high percentage of Mestizos that vary greatly in composition by place. There is also a minor population of Asians,[*further explanation needed*] especially in Brazil, Peru, and Argentina. The two main languages are by far Spanish and Portuguese, followed by English, French and Dutch in smaller numbers.\n\n\n\n### Language[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of South America\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nContinent\n\n\"Southern America\" redirects here.

These metropolitan areas all have a population of above 4 million and include the S\u00e3o Paulo metropolitan area, Rio de Janeiro metropolitan area, and Belo Horizonte metropolitan area. Whilst the majority of the largest metropolitan areas are within Brazil, Argentina is host to the second largest metropolitan area by population in South America: the Buenos Aires metropolitan region is above 13 million inhabitants.\n\n\nSouth America has also been witness to the growth of megapolitan areas. In Brazil four megaregions exist including the Expanded Metropolitan Complex of S\u00e3o Paulo with more than 32 million inhabitants. The others are the Greater Rio, Greater Belo Horizonte and Greater Porto Alegre. Colombia also has four megaregions which comprise 72% of its population, followed by Venezuela, Argentina and Peru which are also homes of megaregions.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMain articles: Economy of South America, List of Latin American and Caribbean countries by GDP (nominal), and List of South American countries by GDP (PPP)\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section needs to be **updated**.

The geography of western South America is dominated by the Andes mountains; in contrast, the eastern part contains both highland regions and vast lowlands where rivers such as the Amazon, Orinoco and Paran\u00e1 flow. Most of the continent lies in the tropics, except for a large part of the Southern Cone located in the middle latitudes.\n\n\nThe continent's cultural and ethnic outlook has its origin with the interaction of indigenous peoples with European conquerors and immigrants and, more locally, with African slaves. Given a long history of colonialism, the overwhelming majority of South Americans speak Spanish or Portuguese, and societies and states are rich in Western traditions. Relative to Europe, Asia and Africa, post-1900 South America has been a peaceful continent with few wars.[10][11][k]\n\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of South America\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* ![](image)\u00a0Argentina\n* ![](image)\u00a0Bolivia\n* ![](image)\u00a0Brazil\n* ![](image)\u00a0Chile\n* ![](image)\u00a0Colombia\n* ![](image)\u00a0Ecuador\n* ![](image)\u00a0Guyana\n* ![](image)\u00a0Panama[a]\n* ![](image)\u00a0Paraguay\n* ![](image)\u00a0Peru\n* ![](image)\u00a0Suriname\n* ![](image)\u00a0Trinidad and Tobago[b]\n* ![](image)\u00a0Uruguay\n* ![](image)\u00a0Venezuela\n |\n| Dependencies | External (2\u20135)\n\n* ![](image)\u00a0Aruba[c] (Netherlands)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Bouvet Island[d] (Norway)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Cura\u00e7ao[b] (Netherlands)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Falkland Islands (United Kingdom)\n* ![](image)\u00a0South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands[e] (United Kingdom)\n\nInternal (1\u20133)\n\n* ![](image)\u00a0Ascension Island[f] (United Kingdom)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Bonaire[b] (Netherlands)\n* ![](image)\u00a0French Guiana (France)\n |\n| Languages | * Spanish\n* Portuguese\n* English\n* Dutch\n* French\n* Aymara\n* Guaran\u00ed\n* Mapudungun\n* Quechua\n* Wayuu\n* Other languages\n |\n| Time zones | UTC\u221202:00 to UTC\u221205:00 |\n| Largest cities | 10 largest cities in South America (2015)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe economic gap between the rich and poor in most South American nations is larger than on most other continents.
