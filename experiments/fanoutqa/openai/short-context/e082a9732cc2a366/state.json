Carbon in the form of diamond can be more expensive than rhodium. Per-kilogram prices of some synthetic radioisotopes range to trillions of dollars. While the difficulty of obtaining macroscopic samples of synthetic elements in part explains their high value, there has been interest in converting base metals to gold (Chrysopoeia) since ancient times, but only deeper understanding of nuclear physics has allowed the actual production of a tiny amount of gold from other elements for research purposes as demonstrated by Glenn Seaborg.[1][2] However, both this and other routes of synthesis of precious metals via nuclear reactions is orders of magnitude removed from economic viability.\n\n\nChlorine, sulfur and carbon (as coal) are cheapest by mass.

Brand | *1669* | *H. Brand* | Prepared and isolated from urine, it was the first element whose discovery date and discoverer is recorded.[42] Its name first appears in print in the work of Georg Kaspar Kirchmayer\u00a0[de] in 1676. Recognised as an element by Lavoisier.[5] |\n| 14\n | Silicon | 1669\n | J. J. Becher | 1823\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  | **1789** | **A. Lavoisier** |  |  | Lavoisier writes the first modern list of chemical elements \u2013 containing 33 elements including light and heat but omitting Na, K (he was unsure of whether soda and potash without carbonic acid, i.e. Na2O and K2O, are simple substances or compounds like NH3),[78] Sr, Te; some elements were listed in the table as unextracted \"radicals\" (Cl, F, B) or as oxides (Ca, Mg, Ba, Al, Si).[63] He also redefines the term \"element\". Until then, no metals except mercury were considered elements.\n |\n| 40\n | Zirconium | 1789\n | H. Klaproth | 1824\n | J. Berzelius | Martin Heinrich Klaproth identified a new oxide in zircon in 1789,[79][80] and in 1808 Davy showed that this oxide has a metallic base although he could not isolate it.[81][82] |\n| 92\n | Uranium | 1789\n | H. Klaproth | 1841\n | E.-M. P\u00e9ligot | Klaproth mistakenly identified a uranium oxide obtained from pitchblende as the element itself and named it after the recently discovered planet Uranus.[83][84] |\n| 22\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | S. Tennant | *1803* | *S. Tennant* | Tennant had been working on samples of South American platinum in parallel with Wollaston and discovered two new elements, which he named osmium and iridium.[104] |\n| 77\n | Iridium | 1803\n | S. Tennant and H.-V. Collet-Descotils | *1803* | *S. Tennant* | Tennant had been working on samples of South American platinum in parallel with Wollaston and discovered two new elements, which he named osmium and iridium, and published the iridium results in 1804.[105] Collet-Descotils also found iridium the same year, but not osmium.[72] |\n| 45\n | Rhodium | 1804\n | H. Wollaston | *1804* | *H. Wollaston* | Wollaston discovered and isolated it from crude platinum samples from South America.[106] |\n| 53\n | Iodine | 1811\n | B. Courtois | *1811* | *B. Courtois* | Courtois discovered it in the ashes of seaweed.[107] The name *iode* was given in French by Gay-Lussac and published in 1813.[108] Davy gave it the English name *iodine* in 1814.[108] |\n| 3\n | Lithium | 1817\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | Africa | Abydos, Egypt | It is believed that lead smelting began at least 9,000 years ago, and the oldest known artifact of lead is a statuette found at the temple of Osiris on the site of Abydos dated around 3800\u00a0BC.[6] Recognised as an element by Guyton de Morveau, Lavoisier, Berthollet, and Fourcroy in 1787.[5] |\n| 79\n | Gold | Before 6000\u00a0BC\n | Before 4000\u00a0BC\n | Levant | Wadi Qana | The earliest gold artifacts were discovered at the site of Wadi Qana in the Levant.[7] Recognised as an element by Guyton de Morveau, Lavoisier, Berthollet, and Fourcroy in 1787.[5] |\n| 47\n | Silver | Before 5000\u00a0BC\n | ca. 4000\u00a0BC\n | Asia Minor | Asia Minor | Estimated to have been discovered in Asia Minor shortly after copper and gold.[8][9] Recognised as an element by Guyton de Morveau, Lavoisier, Berthollet, and Fourcroy in 1787.[5] |\n| 26\n | Iron | Before 5000\u00a0BC\n | 4000\u00a0BC\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n98. **^** \"23 Vanadium\".
