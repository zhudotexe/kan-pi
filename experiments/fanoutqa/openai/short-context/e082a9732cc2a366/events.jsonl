Carbon in the form of diamond can be more expensive than rhodium. Per-kilogram prices of some synthetic radioisotopes range to trillions of dollars. While the difficulty of obtaining macroscopic samples of synthetic elements in part explains their high value, there has been interest in converting base metals to gold (Chrysopoeia) since ancient times, but only deeper understanding of nuclear physics has allowed the actual production of a tiny amount of gold from other elements for research purposes as demonstrated by Glenn Seaborg.[1][2] However, both this and other routes of synthesis of precious metals via nuclear reactions is orders of magnitude removed from economic viability.\n\n\nChlorine, sulfur and carbon (as coal) are cheapest by mass.
