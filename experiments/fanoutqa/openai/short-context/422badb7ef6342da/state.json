However, after the nomination of Michael Curtiz for two films, *Angels with Dirty Faces* and *Four Daughters*, at the 11th Academy Awards, the rules were revised so that an individual could only be nominated for one film at each ceremony.[6] That rule has since been amended, although the only director who has received multiple nominations in the same year was Steven Soderbergh for *Erin Brockovich* and *Traffic* in 2000, winning the award for the latter. The Academy Awards for Best Director and Best Picture have been very closely linked throughout their history. Of the 89 films that won Best Picture and were also nominated for Best Director, 68 won the award.[7][8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe **Academy Award for Best Director** (officially known as the **Academy Award of Merit for Directing**) is an award presented annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS). It is given in honor of a film director who has exhibited outstanding directing while working in the film industry.\nThe award is traditionally presented by the previous year's Best Director winner.\n\n\nThe 1st Academy Awards ceremony was held in 1929 with the award being split into \"Dramatic\" and \"Comedy\" categories; Frank Borzage and Lewis Milestone won for *7th Heaven* and *Two Arabian Knights*, respectively.[1] However, these categories were merged for all subsequent ceremonies.[2] Nominees are determined by single transferable vote within the directors branch of AMPAS; winners are selected by a plurality vote from the entire eligible voting members of the academy.[3][4][5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Dirks, Tim. \"1927\u201328 Academy Awards Winners\".

          "content": "<document>\n<title>Daniels (directors)</title>\n<fragment>\n\n**Daniel Kwan** (born February 10, 1988)[1] and **Daniel Scheinert** (born June 7, 1987),[2] known collectively as the **Daniels**, are an American filmmaker duo. They began their career as directors of music videos,[3] including ones for \"Houdini\" (2012) by Foster the People and \"Turn Down for What\" (2013) by DJ Snake and Lil Jon, both of which earned them nominations at the Grammy Awards.\n\n\nThey have since ventured into film, having written and directed the absurdist comedy-dramas *Swiss Army Man* (2016) and *Everything Everywhere All at Once* (2022). The latter became the independent production company A24's highest-grossing release,[4] and won the duo many awards, including three Academy Awards: for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Original Screenplay.[5][6][7]\n\n\n\n\n## Careers[edit]\n\n\n### Music videos[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAmerican filmmakers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Daniels\n |\n| --- |\n| ![Daniels smiling in front of a film poster](image)Scheinert (left) and Kwan promoting *Swiss Army Man* in 2016\n |\n| Born | **Daniel Kwan** (1988-02-10) February 10, 1988 (age\u00a036)Westborough, Massachusetts, U.S.\n\n---\n\n**Daniel Scheinert** (1987-06-07) June 7, 1987 (age\u00a037)Birmingham, Alabama, U.S. |\n| Alma\u00a0mater | Emerson College (BFA) |\n| Occupations | * Film directors\n* screenwriters\n* producers\n |\n| Years\u00a0active | 2007\u2013present |\n| Notable work | *Swiss Army Man**Everything Everywhere All at Once* |\n| Spouse | Kwan: \nKirsten Lepore\n \u200b\n(m.\u00a02016)\u200b\n |\n| Children | Kwan: 1 |\n| Awards | Academy Award for Best PictureAcademy Award for Best DirectorAcademy Award for Best Original Screenplay*Everything Everywhere All at Once* (2022) |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* *The Good Place*: \"Whenever You're Ready\" \u2013 Michael Schur (2020)\n* *WandaVision* \u2013 Jac Schaeffer and writing staff (2021)\n* *Everything Everywhere All at Once* - Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert (2022)\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nOnline Film Critics Society Award for Best Director\n |\n| --- |\n| * James Cameron (1997)\n* Steven Spielberg (1998)\n* Sam Mendes (1999)\n* Darren Aronofsky (2000)\n* David Lynch (2001)\n* Peter Jackson (2002)\n* Peter Jackson (2003)\n* Michel Gondry (2004)\n* David Cronenberg (2005)\n* Martin Scorsese (2006)\n* Joel Coen and Ethan Coen (2007)\n* Christopher Nolan (2008)\n* Kathryn Bigelow (2009)\n* David Fincher (2010)\n* Terrence Malick (2011)\n* Paul Thomas Anderson (2012)\n* Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n (2013)\n* Richard Linklater (2014)\n* George Miller (2015)\n* Barry Jenkins (2016)\n* Christopher Nolan (2017)\n* Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n (2018)\n* Bong Joon-ho (2019)\n* Chlo\u00e9 Zhao (2020)\n* Jane Campion (2021)\n* Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert (2022)\n* Christopher Nolan (2023)\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Official website ![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\n* Daniel Kwan at IMDb\n* Daniel Scheinert at IMDb\n* Edgar Wright's interview with Daniels on BFI\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nDan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert\n |\n| --- |\n| * *Swiss Army Man* (2016)\n* *The Death of Dick Long* (2019; Scheinert only)\n* *Everything Everywhere All at Once* (2022)\n\t+ Soundtrack\n\t+ Accolades\n\t+ Evelyn Quan Wang\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Gillian Flynn (2014)\n* Drew Goddard (2015)\n* Whit Stillman (2016)\n* Scott Neustadter and Michael H.
