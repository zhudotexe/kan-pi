However, theatrical box-office earnings are the primary metric for trade publications in assessing the success of a film, mostly because of the availability of the data compared to sales figures for home video and broadcast rights, but also because of historical practice. Included on the list are charts of the top box-office earners (ranked by both the nominal and real value of their revenue), a chart of high-grossing films by calendar year, a timeline showing the transition of the highest-grossing film record, and a chart of the highest-grossing film franchises and series. All charts are ranked by international theatrical box-office performance where possible, excluding income derived from home video, broadcasting rights, and merchandise.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSteven Spielberg is the most represented director on the chart, with six films to his credit, occupying the top spot in 1975, 1981, 1982, 1984, 1989 and 1993. Cecil B. DeMille (1932, 1947, 1949, 1952 and 1956) is in second place with five films and William Wyler (1942, 1946, 1959 and 1968) and James Cameron (1991, 1997, 2009 and 2022) are tied for third place with four films. D. W. Griffith (1915, 1916 and 1920), George Roy Hill (1966, 1969 and 1973) and the Russo brothers (2016, 2018 and 2019) all feature heavily with three films apiece. George Lucas directed two chart-toppers in 1977 and 1999, but also served in a strong creative capacity as a producer and writer in 1980, 1981, 1983, 1984 and 1989 as well. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe following directors have also all directed two films on the chart: Frank Lloyd, King Vidor, Frank Capra, Michael Curtiz, Leo McCarey, Alfred Hitchcock, David Lean, Stanley Kubrick, Guy Hamilton, Mike Nichols, William Friedkin, Peter Jackson, Gore Verbinski, and Michael Bay; Mervyn LeRoy, Ken Annakin and Robert Wise are each represented by one solo credit and one shared credit, and John Ford co-directed two films. Disney films are usually co-directed and some directors have served on several winning teams: Wilfred Jackson, Hamilton Luske, Clyde Geronimi, David Hand, Ben Sharpsteen, Wolfgang Reitherman and Bill Roberts have all co-directed at least two films on the list. Only seven directors have topped the chart in consecutive years: McCarey (1944 and 1945), Nichols (1966 and 1967), Spielberg (1981 and 1982), Jackson (2002 and 2003), Verbinski (2006 and 2007) and the Russo brothers (2018 and 2019).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHighest-grossing films[12]\n| Rank\n | Peak\n | Title\n | Worldwide gross\n | Year\n | Reference(s)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | 1\n | *Avatar* | $2,923,706,026\n | 2009\n | [# 1][# 2] |\n| 2\n | 1\n | *Avengers: Endgame* | $2,797,501,328\n | 2019\n | [# 3][# 4] |\n| 3\n | 3\n | *Avatar: The Way of Water* | $2,320,250,281\n | 2022\n | [# 5][# 6] |\n| 4\n | 1\n | *Titanic* | T$2,257,844,554\n | 1997\n | [# 7][# 8] |\n| 5\n | 3\n | *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* | $2,068,223,624\n | 2015\n | [# 9][# 10] |\n| 6\n | 4\n | *Avengers: Infinity War* | $2,048,359,754\n | 2018\n | [# 11][# 12] |\n| 7\n | 6\n | *Spider-Man: No Way Home* | $1,921,847,111\n | 2021\n | [# 13][# 14] |\n| 8\n | 3\n | *Jurassic World* | $1,671,537,444\n | 2015\n | [# 15][# 16] |\n| 9\n | 7\n | *The Lion King* | $1,656,943,394\n | 2019\n | [# 17][# 4] |\n| 10\n | 3\n | *The Avengers* | $1,518,815,515\n | 2012\n | [# 18][# 19] |\n| 11\n | 4\n | *Furious 7* | $1,515,341,399\n | 2015\n | [# 20][# 21] |\n| 12\n | 11\n | *Top Gun: Maverick* | $1,495,696,292\n | 2022\n | [# 22][# 23] |\n| 13\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | [# 3] |\n| 2021[97] | *Avatar* | $2,847,397,339 ‡ | [# 1] |\n| *2022* | $2,923,706,026 ‡ |\n\n\nRDistributor rental.\n\n\n‡Includes revenue from re-releases.

Both *The Birth of a Nation* and *Gone with the Wind* spent twenty-five consecutive years apiece as the highest-grosser, with films directed by Steven Spielberg and James Cameron holding the record on three occasions each. Spielberg became the first director to break his own record when *Jurassic Park* overtook *E.T.*, and Cameron emulated the feat when *Avatar* broke the record set by *Titanic*. When it took over the top spot in 2019, *Avengers: Endgame* became the first sequel to hold the record of highest-grossing film, and in doing so interrupted thirty-six years of Spielberg/Cameron dominance before *Avatar* reclaimed the top spot two years later in 2021 upon a re-release.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHigh-grossing films by year of release[47][48][49]\n| Year\n | Title\n | Worldwide gross\n | Budget\n | Reference(s)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1915 | *The Birth of a Nation* | $50,000,000–100,000,000$20,000,000+R ($5,200,000)R | $110,000 | [# 84][# 85][# 86] |\n| 1916 | *Intolerance* | $1,750,000R IN | $385,907 | [50][51] |\n| 1917 | *Cleopatra* | $500,000\\*R | $300,000 | [# 87][# 88] |\n| 1918 | *Mickey* | $8,000,000 | $250,000 | [# 89] |\n| 1919 | *The Miracle Man* | $3,000,000R | $120,000 | [# 90] |\n| 1920 | *Way Down East* | $5,000,000R ($4,000,000)R | $800,000 | [# 91][# 92] |\n| 1921 | *The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse* | $5,000,000R ($4,000,000)R | $600,000–800,000 | [# 93] |\n| 1922 | *Douglas Fairbanks in Robin Hood* | $2,500,000R | $930,042.78 | [# 94][# 95] |\n| 1923 | *The Covered Wagon* | $5,000,000R | $800,000 | [# 96][# 97] |\n| 1924 | *The Sea Hawk* | $3,000,000R | $700,000 | [# 96] |\n| 1925 | *The Big Parade* | $18,000,000–22,000,000R  ($6,131,000)R | $382,000 | [# 98][# 99][# 100] |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWhile inflation has eroded the achievements of most films from the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, there are franchises originating from that period that are still active. Besides the *Star Wars* and *Superman* franchises, *James Bond* and *Godzilla* films are still being released periodically; all four are among the highest-grossing franchises. Some of the older films that held the record of highest-grossing film still have respectable grosses by today's standards, but no longer compete numerically against today's top-earners in an era of much higher individual ticket prices. When those prices are adjusted for inflation, however, then *Gone with the Wind*—which was the highest-grossing film outright for twenty-five years—is still the highest-grossing film of all time. All grosses on the list are expressed in U.S. dollars at their nominal value, except where stated otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n## Highest-grossing films[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn this chart, films are ranked by the revenues from theatrical exhibition at their nominal value, along with the highest positions they attained. Six films in total have grossed in excess of $2 billion worldwide, with *Avatar* ranked in the top position. All of the films have had a theatrical run (including re-releases) in the 21st century, and films that have not played during this period do not appear on the chart because of ticket-price inflation, population size and ticket purchasing trends not being considered.\n\n\n\n\n† *Background shading indicates films playing in the week commencing 13 June 2024 in theaters around the world*.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Pincus-Roth, Zachary (January 8, 2006). \"Movies aren't the only B.O. monsters\". *Variety*.

Grosses are not limited to original theatrical runs either, with many older films often being re-released periodically so the figures represent all the business a film has done since its original release; a film's first-run gross is included in brackets after the total if known. Because of incomplete data it cannot be known for sure how much money some films have made and when they made it, but generally the chart chronicles the films from each year that went on to earn the most. In the cases where estimates conflict both films are recorded, and in cases where a film has moved into first place because of being re-released the previous record-holder is also retained.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| General | * Highest-grossing films worldwide\n* Box office admissions\n* Non-English\n* Openings\n* R-rated\n* Video game adaptations\n* Independent films\n |\n| Animated | * Decades\n\t+ 1980s\n\t+ 1990s\n\t+ 2000s\n\t+ 2010s\n\t+ 2020s\n* Live-action/animated\n* Openings\n* Box office admissions\n* adult-oriented animated films\n |\n| By genre | * Action\n* Christmas\n* Fantasy\n* Horror\n* Live-action comedy\n* Musical\n* Puppet\n* Science fiction\n* Sports\n* Superhero\n |\n| By origin | * Bangladeshi\n* Czech\n* Filipino\n* Greek\n* Mexican\n* Indian\n\t+ overseas\n\t+ Bengali\n\t+ Hindi\n\t+ Malayalam\n\t+ Punjabi\n\t+ Telugu\n\t+ Tamil\n\t+ Kannada\n* Italian\n* Iranian\n* Japanese\n* Nigerian\n* Pakistani\n* Portuguese\n* Russian\n |\n| By region | * Australia\n* Austria\n* China\n* France\n* Germany\n* Hong Kong\n* India\n* Indonesia\n* Italy\n* Japan\n* Malaysia\n* Nepal\n* Pakistan\n* Philippines\n* Romania\n* Russia\n* Singapore\n* South Korea\n* Soviet Union\n* Spain\n\t+ Catalan\n* Taiwan\n* Thailand\n* Turkey\n* United Kingdom\n* United States and Canada\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nT*Guinness*' adjusted total for *Titanic* only increased by $102,000,000 between the 2012 (published in 2011) and 2015 editions, a rise of 4.2% shared by the other adjusted totals in the chart, and omitted the gross from a 3D re-release in 2012.[35][38] This chart incorporates the gross of $343,550,770 from the reissue and adjusts it from the 2013 index.[39] *Titanic* grossed a further $762,994 during limited re-releases in 2017 and 2020, but this sum is not represented in the adjusted total.[40]\n\n\nAEThe gross for *Avengers: Endgame* is adjusted from the 2020 index.\n\n\nTFAThe gross for *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* is adjusted from the 2016 index.\n\n## High-grossing films by year[edit]\n\n\nGlossary: Distributor rentals\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t+ \"X-Men – Worldwide (Unadjusted)\". *Box Office Mojo*.
