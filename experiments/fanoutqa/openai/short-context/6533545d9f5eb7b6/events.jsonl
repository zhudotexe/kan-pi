New York City enforces a right-to-shelter law guaranteeing shelter to anyone who needs shelter, regardless of their immigration status;[22] and the city is home to more than 3.2 million residents born outside the U.S., the largest foreign-born population of any city in the world as of 2016.[23] It is the most visited U.S. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Nigro, Carmen. \"So, Why Do We Call It Gotham, Anyway?\", New York Public Library, January 25, 2011.
