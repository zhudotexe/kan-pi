Messi assumed captaincy of Barcelona in 2018, and won a record sixth Ballon d'Or in 2019.

His game-winning goal in stoppage time was his 500th for Barcelona.[220] His memorable celebration saw him taking off his Barcelona shirt and holding it up to incensed Real Madrid fans \u2013 with his name and number facing the crowd.[221] On 27 May, Messi scored a goal and set up another for Paco Alc\u00e1cer in the 2017 Copa del Rey final, helping Barcelona to a 3\u20131 victory over Alav\u00e9s, and was named Man of the Match.[222] In total, Messi finished the 2016\u201317 season with 54 goals, while his 37 goals in La Liga saw him claim both the Pichichi and European Golden Boot Awards for the fourth time in his career.[223]\n\n\n\n#### 2017\u201318: domestic double and a record fifth Golden Boot[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nA prolific goalscorer and creative playmaker, Messi holds the records for most goals in La Liga (474), most hat-tricks in La Liga (36) and the UEFA Champions League (eight), and most assists in La Liga (192) and the Copa Am\u00e9rica (17).

With his 35th trophy with Barcelona, Messi also overtook former Manchester United winger Ryan Giggs as the most decorated footballer for a single club.[312][313] On 16 May, Messi scored his 30th league goal of the campaign in a 1\u20132 home defeat against Celta Vigo, which later turned out to be his final goal and match in a Barcelona shirt.[314] The top goalscorer in La Liga, Messi received the Pichichi trophy for a record eighth time in his career.[315] It was also his record fifth consecutive win in La Liga, surpassing Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano and Hugo S\u00e1nchez who both had four for Real Madrid.[315]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMessi scored three goals (including two free kicks) in a 4\u20131 home win against Celta Vigo.

Dortmund were the 34th team he had scored against in the competition, breaking the previous record of 33 held by Cristiano Ronaldo and Ra\u00fal.[275] On 2 December, Messi was awarded a record-breaking sixth Ballon d'Or.[276] On 8 December, Messi scored his record-breaking 35th hat-trick in La Liga with three goals in Barcelona's 5\u20132 home win over Mallorca.[277]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nwith Messi scoring Barcelona's only goal in that game.[309] On 15 March, Messi scored two goals in a 4\u20131 win against Huesca, and became the first player in history to score at least 20 goals in 13 consecutive seasons in the top five European leagues.[310] On 21 March, he surpassed Xavi's record to reach a club record of 768 appearances, in which he also scored a brace in a 6\u20131 away win against Real Sociedad.[311]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

During the 1950s, he was a leading member of the successful Barcelona team, scoring 280 goals in 345 appearances (including unofficial goals). During the club's 1999 centenary celebrations, a fan's poll declared Kubala the best player ever to play for the Spanish club. After retiring as a player, he had two spells as coach of Barcelona and also coached both Spain's senior national team and Olympic team.[6][7]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and career[edit]\n\n\n### Childhood and youth[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Gaarskj\u00e6r, Jesper (2010). *Bar\u00e7a: Historien om FC Barcelona*.

As his signing-on bonus, he received a luminous watch and a three-piece suit. Among his teammates at the club was his childhood friend Sagibarba. During holidays at the Catalan resort of Cadaqu\u00e9s, Samitier and Sagibarba had played football with, among others, Salvador Dal\u00ed. He was also friends with the famous Spanish artist Salvador Dal\u00ed.[4]\n\n\n\n### FC Barcelona[edit]\n\n\nBy 1925 Samitier was the highest-paid player in Spain. He was a member of the legendary FC Barcelona team, coached by Jack Greenwell, that, apart from Sagibarba, also included Paulino Alc\u00e1ntara, Ricardo Zamora, F\u00e9lix Ses\u00famaga and, later, Franz Platko. Between 1919 and 1933 he won twelve Campionat de Catalunya titles, five Copa del Rey and the very first La Liga title. Among the goals he scored were four in the Copa del Rey finals of 1922, 1925, 1926 and 1928.\n\n\n\n### Madrid CF[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
