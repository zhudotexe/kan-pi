Everybody in his family was involved in music: his father and his uncle were violinists, his mother a pianist and his sister a cellist. He received his first violin lessons from his father, with whom he started to study seriously when he was 4–5 years old. At 6 he enrolled at the Dinu Lipatti Music School and then at George Enescu Music High School where he was a first prize student. He played with his father at weddings and celebrations and developed his improvisation skills. When he was about 13 he heard violinist Stéphane Grappelli, who would become his idol and jazz his main attraction.\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nIn 1991 he left for Paris to fulfill his dream of meeting Grappelli and making a name in jazz. He got his first gig at a Russian cabaret. He enrolled in the Conservatoire de Paris, although his jazz teacher told him from the first audition that he shouldn't waste his time and should be playing on stage. He continued to play on various scenes with various musicians.\n\n\nNiculescu met Grappelli in 1994. Grappelli proposed they record an album, but Niculescu declined, believing that he didn't deserve the honor. He hoped to receive some lessons from Grappelli but Grappelli told him that he has nothing to teach him as the Romani had a fantastic natural technique.[*citation needed*] In 1995 he joined Romane's band, and in 2001 he was invited by Biréli Lagrène to join his Gipsy Project inspired by the Quintette du Hot Club de France.\n\n\nHe has worked with Roberto Alagna, Charles Aznavour, Marcel Azzola, George Benson, Dee Dee Bridgewater, Patrick Bruel, Regina Carter, Angelo Debarre, Angela Gheorghiu, Johnny Hallyday, Hot Club de Norvège, Patricia Kaas, Jon Larsen, Giani Lincan, Wynton Marsalis, John McLaughlin, Oscar Peterson, Bucky Pizzarelli, Babik Reinhardt, Jimmy Rosenberg, Henri Salvador, and Tchavolo Schmitt. Violinist Scott Tixier was Niculescu only student when he was 15 years old in Paris.\n\n\n\n## Discography[edit]\n\n\n* 1995 *Portrait of Django* with Hot Club de Norvège\n* 1999 *L'Esprit Roumain* with Corneliu Niculescu\n* 2000 *Gipsy Ballad*\n* 2005 *Djangophonie* (Le Chant du Monde)\n* 2005 *Four Friends* (Jardis)\n* 2008 *Florin Niculescu Plays Stéphane Grapelli* (Blu Jazz)\n* 2010 *Django Tunes* (Enja)[2]\n* 2018 *Florilège* (Hot Club Records)\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Florin Niculescu\".

He performs and teaches internationally as an improvisational violinist, and at the intersections of performing and multimedia arts, philosophy, and ecology.\n\n\n\n\n## Biography[edit]\n\n\nBorn in 1950, Nachmanovitch grew up in Los Angeles and studied at Harvard University and the University of California at Santa Cruz, where he earned a PhD in the History of Consciousness for an exploration of William Blake. His mentor was the anthropologist and philosopher Gregory Bateson. At Harvard he worked with Jerome Bruner and Irven DeVore. He has taught and lectured widely in the United States and abroad on creativity and the spiritual underpinnings of art. In the 1970s he was a pioneer in free improvisation on violin, viola and electric violin[1] and opened up many techniques now used in electroacoustic music. He has presented master classes and workshops in improvisation at many conservatories and universities worldwide, including the Yehudi Menuhin School and Juilliard. He has had numerous appearances on radio, television, and at music and theater festivals. He has collaborated with other artists in media including music, dance, theater, and film, and has developed programs melding art, music, literature, and computer technology. He has published articles in a variety of fields since 1966, and is the author of *Free Play: Improvisation in Life and Art* (Penguin-Tarcher, 1990), and *The Art of Is: Improvising as a Way of Life*, (New World Library, 2019). Much of his teaching beyond music and the arts relates to the universality of improvisation and creativity in all fields of life, and the accessibility of improvisational process to each person at each moment[2]\n\n\n\n\n> \n> It is the most normal thing in the world to improvise. We improvise every time we say a sentence, but we are told in our veneration of the masters that the creative process is some sort of mysterious and godlike thing only possessed by a few people – when in fact we are improvising all the time, creating all the time.[3]\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s he created computer music software including *The World Music Menu* (first developed 1987, new versions through 2007),[4] and the visual music software tools *Zmusic* (first presented at the Visual Music Alliance, Los Angeles, 1987) and *Visual Music Tone Painter* (first developed 1992, new versions through 2007).[5]\n\n\nIn the years following the millennium his time has been divided between improvisation concerts on violin, viola, electric violin and viola d'amore, both solo and in partnership with other musicians, dancers, and theater artists, lecturing and teaching workshops on improvisation, writing about creativity and about the influence of Gregory Bateson on modern thought, and visual music and other multimedia works.\n\n\nHe has served on the boards of the International Society for Improvised Music,[6] the New Violin Family Association[7] and the Bateson Idea Group.\n\n\n\n## Works[edit]\n\n\n### Bibliography[edit]\n\n\n#### Books[edit]\n\n\n* The Art of Is: Improvising as a Way of Life (New World Library, 2019).

Aged nine, she won first prize at the École Supérieure de Musique and the City of Paris Prix d'Honneur. After further studies with Jules Boucherit at the Conservatoire de Paris, she completed her training with instruction from George Enescu (who had been Yehudi Menuhin's teacher), Nadia Boulanger and Carl Flesch.[3] Flesch offered to teach her without charge after hearing her in the Vienna International Violin Competition, at which, aged 12, she was placed fourth out of 250 entrants.[3] The *Vienna Neues Tageblatt* wrote, \"If you close your eyes, you think you are listening to the vigorous playing of a man and not that of a little girl in a white frock.\"\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nIn 1935, aged 15, Neveu achieved worldwide celebrity status when she won the Henryk Wieniawski Violin Competition.[4] Unable to afford the cost of travel to Warsaw, the family was helped by Flesch, who paid for the trip. In the preliminary round (of 180 competitors) Neveu was placed first, 26 points ahead of David Oistrakh, and in the final again she came in first. She was 15, Oistrakh 27 at the time. Henri Temianka was placed third. Neveu was immediately signed to an extensive touring contract which over the next two years saw her give solo performances at the leading concert halls of Germany, Poland, the Soviet Union, the United States and Canada.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nNeveu's international career was interrupted by World War II, during which she gave few concerts, nearly all in France. Many invitations to play in Germany were turned down. She was finally able to make her London debut in 1946.[3] She recorded Sibelius's Violin Concerto at Abbey Road Studios in the same year.[3]\n\n\nHer brother Jean-Paul usually accompanied her on piano, and the two toured postwar Europe extensively, appearing at the Prague Spring International Music Festival as well as visiting Australia and South America. They also played return engagements at major venues in the United States. At one concert in the Royal Albert Hall, Queen Elizabeth was so moved by the Beethoven Concerto that she invited Neveu up to the royal box for the second half. 'On the platform,' wrote the critic of the *New York Telegram*, 'Ginette Neveu is an impressive figure – tall, dark, and with an imposing manner. Whenever there is a rest for the violin she stands like an acolyte robed in white, her eyes fixed on the conductor ... it is fascinating.'[*citation needed*]\n\n\nNeveu made few commercial recordings, but all of them remain in the catalogue. She recorded the Brahms and Sibelius Concertos, Ravel's Tzigane, Chausson's *Poème*, the Debussy Sonata (with her brother) and a handful of shorter pieces. There are also two recordings of her Beethoven Concerto (with Hans Rosbaud and Willem van Otterloo conducting) and two other recordings of her Brahms (with Antal Dorati and Hans Schmidt-Isserstedt) from non-commercial sources. Most highly praised, and most revelatory, was her Sibelius (with the Philharmonia Orchestra and Walter Susskind). Of it, the composer wrote, 'I particularly wish to speak of my feeling of profound gratitude when I think of the inspired and extremely sensitive performance of my Violin Concerto which Ginette Neveu rendered unforgettable.' She loved the Concerto, but, as she said, 'Ils ne le connaissent en France, et ils ne veulent pas le connaitre!' (They don't know it in France, and they don't want to know it!). Perhaps she was thinking of that difficult concerto when she wrote, 'As far as I am concerned, the truly technical problems which are the most disconcerting and the most fruitful are those posed by composers who have a strong personality and pursue the essence of their musical idea to its logical conclusion without wasting too much sympathy on the performer.'[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Plane crash and death[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Neveu's grave in Père Lachaise Cemetery, Paris.\nNeveu gave her last concert in Paris on 20 October 1949. On 28 October, she was on board an Air France flight from Paris to New York when it crashed on a mountain after two failed attempts to make a landing at the Santa Maria Airport in the Azores. All 48 people on board the flight died, including Ginette, her brother Jean Neveu, and the French former boxing champion Marcel Cerdan. Her violin, made by Omobono Stradivari in 1730, was also lost.[5]\n\n\nDuring the return of the bodies to France, Neveu's coffin was confused with that of another victim, Amélie Ringler, whose funeral took place before the error was discovered. On 28 November, Neveu's brother-in-law identified her remains in the coffin disinterred from the graveyard in Bantzenheim. Neveu now lies in Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris, close to the grave of Frédéric Chopin.[6]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Plaque in honour of Neveu at the Salle Pleyel.\nAfter Neveu's death, tributes poured in. The Queen of Belgium visited the grieving family, who had lost a son and a daughter. The composer Francis Poulenc, whose Violin Sonata Neveu had premiered (and parts of which she had contributed), wrote, 'I am haunted by the memory of Ginette Neveu. I had the greatest admiration for her and I loved her dearly.' For Pablo Casals, 'Her playing was one of the greatest revelations, both instrumental and musical.' Charles Munch, newly installed conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, who had often worked with her, wrote 'Dear Ginette, the memory of you will never cease to haunt us, and each time that by the grace of God we are able to make music really well, we shall feel you very close to us.' Jacques Thibaud, the great French violinist (who would himself die in a plane crash shortly afterward), wrote, 'Why was it that at the dawn of her days an unjust and relentless stroke of fate should come and cut off a life which was bringing to the world nothing but beauty and joy? But in spite of the sternness of destiny, in the hearts of her friends and of the whole world Ginette is unforgettable. The memory of her will never die.'\n\n\nNeveu was posthumously awarded the Cross of the Legion d'Honneur. A street is named in her memory in the Montmartre region of Paris.\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Ginette Neveu – The Complete Recordings\". *Presto Classical*.

He began playing the violin at the age of 6. His mother died when he was 9. He was taken by his father to Vienna, where his teachers included Max Weissgärber. Nissel was evacuated from Vienna in 1938 to Great Britain.\n\n\nDuring World War II, Nissel was interned as a \"friendly enemy alien\" in Onchan Camp on the Isle of Man where he met the violist Peter Schidlof and later the violinist Norbert Brainin. With the British cellist, Martin Lovett, they would form the Amadeus Quartet.\n\n\nThe Amadeus Quartet, informally known as the Wolf Gang, gave its first concert in London in 1948. The Amadeus Quartet made some 200 recordings, among them the complete quartets of Beethoven, Brahms, and Mozart and works by 20th-century composers such as Béla Bartók and Benjamin Britten (who wrote his third quartet for them).\n\n\nNissel played the \"Payne\" Stradivarius of 1731.\n\n\nHe married the statistician Muriel Griffiths in 1957, and they had a daughter Claire and a son Daniel.[1]\n\n\nFollowing the death of Schidlof from a heart attack in 1987, the Amadeus Quartet disbanded. Nissel became a teacher of young quartets at the Royal Academy of Music, and died in London.\n\n\n\n## Further reading[edit]\n\n\n* Muriel Nissel, *Married to the Amadeus: Life with a String Quartet*, ISBN 1-900357-12-7, Giles de la Mare Publishers Limited, 1998 (a memoir by Nissel's wife of her \"marriage\" to the Amadeus)\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Siegmund Nissel, 86, of Amadeus Group, Is Dead\", *New York Times*, 24 May 2008\n\n## External links[edit]\n\n\n* Siegmund Nissel: Second violin and administrator for the Amadeus Quartet, obituary in *The Telegraph*, 23 May 2008\n* Siegmund Nissel, 86, of Amadeus Group, Is Dead, obituary in *The New York Times*, 24 May 2008\n\n\nSee also: Nissel\n\n| Authority control databases ![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\n |\n| --- |\n| International | * ISNI\n* VIAF\n* WorldCat\n |\n| National | * Spain\n* France\n* BnF data\n* Germany\n* Italy\n* Israel\n* United States\n* Czech Republic\n |\n| Artists | * LexM\n* MusicBrainz\n |\n| People | * BMLO\n* Deutsche Biographie\n |\n| Other | * IdRef\n |\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![Stub icon](image) | This article about an Austrian musician is a stub.

He performed world premieres of numerous works, the first two books of the Freeman Etudes (etudes I–XVI and XVII–XXXII) by American composer John Cage among others.[1] He was also the first European violinist who recorded the complete Violin and Piano Sonatas of Charles Ives (with pianist Cornelius Cardew).[2] He is the author of a teaching and reference book on violin techniques, which was commissioned after he met Pierre Boulez at IRCAM in 1976.[3] In 1979, he joined the faculty of the University of California at San Diego.[1]\n\n\nHe is also known for his computer paintings. He began doing these artworks after moving to San Diego, California.[1]\n\n\n\n\n## Biography[edit]\n\n\nJános Négyesy was born in Budapest, Hungary on September 13, 1938, and died on December 20, 2013. His father was taken by the Nazis to a concentration camp, from where he never returned. He got his first violin at the age of four, and only six months later he gave his first public concert at his school. According to him, this was the moment when he decided to become a violinist.[4] He later became a student of Ferenc Gábriel at the Liszt Ferenc Academy of Music of Budapest, who introduced him to Tibor Varga, a former student of Gábriel before World War II. After receiving an invitation in 1965, Négyesy moved to Detmold and continued his studies with Varga.[5] From 1970 to 1974 he served as concertmaster of the Radio Berlin Orchestra,[6] which was led by Lorin Maazel at the time.[7] In 1976 he was invited by French composer Pierre Boulez to IRCAM for a week of performances.[2] This invitation resulted in a commission for Négyesy to write a book on violin techniques.\n\n\nIn 1979, while staying in Lisboa he received a phone call at 3 a.m. asking him if he would join the Music Department at UCSD. Later it turned out that this call changed his life: as of 2012,[8] he is an active teacher at UCSD. It was there in San Diego where he met Finnish violinist Päivikki Nykter, a former student of his, who became his wife in 1992.[4] During the past decades they made several recordings together, the complete violin duos of Béla Bartók[6] and compositions dedicated to them, among others.\n\n\nThere are several composers who dedicated pieces to Négyesy (probably the most notable is One6 by John Cage[9]) including Attila Bozay, Carlos Fariñas, Vinko Globokar, Georg Hajdu, Roger Reynolds, Robert Wittinger and Isang Yun.[1] He also has notable recordings of pieces of composers like John Cage, Morton Feldman or Kaija Saariaho. Recently he also became regarded as a master of Max Mathews' electronic violin.[6]\nJános Negesy died on Friday, December 20, 2013.[10]\n\n\n\n## Discography[edit]\n\n\n* Dedications – Works for Two Violins Archived 2012-02-27 at the Wayback Machine – Seven works for violin duo written expressly for János Négyesy and Päivikki Nykter.

Since 1998 his regular partner is Italian pianist Enrico Pace.[2][3] Other regular chamber music partners are Heinrich Schiff, Piotr Anderszewski[4] and Christian Zacharias.[5]\n\n\n\n## Stradivarius[edit]\n\n\nFrom 2001 to 2015, Zimmermann played a 1711 Stradivarius violin known as the \"Lady Inchiquin\", previously played by Fritz Kreisler.[6] The violin had been loaned to Zimmermann by Düsseldorf-based bank WestLB AG, but was reclaimed in February 2015 at the termination of the loan contract by the bank's legal successor, Portigon Financial Services, owing to the bank's bankruptcy.[7]\n\n\nIn January 2016 Zimmermann was loaned the 1727 \"Général Dupont\" Stradivarius for an initial period of two years.[8] Also known as the \"Grumiaux\" Stradivarius, it had been owned by the celebrated Belgian virtuoso Arthur Grumiaux. The instrument is owned by entrepreneur, philanthropist and amateur violinist Mr Yu, who purchased it in February 2015 through Rare Violins of New York for an undisclosed sum – making the violin the first Stradivarius to be owned by a private individual on the Chinese mainland.[9]\n\n\nIn July 2016, Zimmermann regained the 1711 ex-Fritz Kreisler 'Lady Inchiquin' Stradivarius violin.[10][11]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Artists – Frank Peter Zimmerman\".

He is best remembered for his long association with Duke Ellington and his orchestra.\n\n\n\n\n## Early years[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Lambert, Eddie (1998), *Duke Ellington: A Listener's Guide*, Lanham, MD: Scarecrow Press, ISBN 978-0-8108-3161-2.\n\n\n## External links[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Ray Nance.\n\n* allmusic.com biography\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNance was born in Chicago on December 10, 1913. He studied piano and violin as a child. In high school, he taught himself trumpet because “I wanted to hear myself on a louder instrument in way I couldn't do with a violin in an orchestra.” He was the leader of his own band in Chicago from 1932 to 1937.[1] An ad in a June 1933 prom book at the Edgewater Beach Hotel for the Staples Cafe, 6344 N. Broadway, Chicago shows \"Ray Nance and His Ebony Aces.\" Then, he worked with Earl Hines from 1937 to 1939; and from 1939 to 1940 he worked with Horace Henderson.[1]\n\n\n\n## Ellington tenure[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Nance in Duke Ellington's orchestra, 1943\nNance was often featured on violin, and was the only violin soloist ever featured in Ellington's orchestra (especially noteworthy is his violin contribution to the original 1942 version of \"The 'C' Jam Blues\"). He is also one of the better known male vocalists associated with Ellington's orchestra. On later recordings of \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)\", Nance took the previously instrumental horn riff into the lead vocal, which constitute the line \"Doo wha, doo wha, doo wha, doo wha, yeah!\" He was often featured as vocalist on \"Jump for Joy,\" \"Just A-Sittin' and A-Rockin'\" and \"Just Squeeze Me (But Please Don't Tease Me)\". His multiple talents (trumpet, violin, vocals and also dancing) earned him the nickname \"Floorshow\".\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNance was absent from the Duke Ellington Orchestra for three or four months in 1946, including the date of that year's Carnegie Hall concert. In 1949, Nance participated, along with Ellington sidemen Russell Procope, Johnny Hodges and Sonny Greer on several Ivory Joe Hunter sessions, for King Records of Cincinnati.\n\n\n\n## Post-Ellington years[edit]\n\n\nHe left Ellington in 1963 during their Middle East tour after having played alongside his returned predecessor Cootie Williams for a year. He continued to make several guest appearances in the orchestra over the years and later toured and recorded in England in 1974.[2]\n\n\nNance made a few recordings as a bandleader, and also recorded or performed with Earl Hines, Rosemary Clooney, Jaki Byard, Chico Hamilton and others.[2]\n\n\n\n## Discography[edit]\n\n\n### As leader[edit]\n\n\n* *Ellingtonia* (Wynne, 1959)\n* *A Flower Is A Lovesome Thing*  (Parker Records, 1959)\n* *Body and Soul* (Solid State, 1970)\n* *Huffin' 'n' Puffin'*  (MPS, 1974)\n\n\n### As sideman[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nEllington hired Nance to replace trumpeter Cootie Williams, who had joined Benny Goodman, in 1940.[1] Nance's first recorded performance with Ellington was at the Fargo, North Dakota ballroom dance.[2] Shortly after joining the band, Nance was given the trumpet solo on the earliest recorded version of \"Take the \"A\" Train\", which became the Ellington theme.[1] Nance's \"A Train\" solo is one of the most copied and admired trumpet solos in jazz history.

His father then taught him to play the clarinet and then the violin at age eight. Early studies were at the Samuel Rubin Academy of Music (now the Buchmann-Mehta School of Music). Isaac Stern and Pablo Casals learned of Zukerman's violin talent during a 1962 visit to Israel. Zukerman subsequently moved to the United States that year to study at the Juilliard School[3] under Stern and Ivan Galamian. He made his New York City debut in 1963. In 1967, he shared the Leventritt Prize with the Korean violinist Kyung-wha Chung. His 1969 debut recordings of the concerti by Tchaikovsky (under the direction of Antal Dorati, with the London Symphony Orchestra) and Mendelssohn (with Leonard Bernstein and the New York Philharmonic) launched a successful recording career of over 110 releases.\n\n\nZukerman launched his conducting career in 1970 with the English Chamber Orchestra, and served as director of London's South Bank Festival from 1971 to 1974. In the US, Zukerman was music director of the Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra from 1980 to 1987. He later directed the summer festivals of the Dallas Symphony Orchestra (1991–95) and the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra (1996–99). In 1999, he became Music Director of Canada's National Arts Centre Orchestra (NACO) in Ottawa,[4][5] stepping down from the post in 2015. He has served as Principal Guest Conductor of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra since 2009.\n\n\nZukerman is on the faculty at the Manhattan School of Music and is the head and founder of the Zukerman Performance Program at the school. His former students include Koh Gabriel Kameda, Julian Rachlin, and Guy Braunstein. In 1999 he founded the National Arts Centre Young Artists Programme, which counts young musicians such as Viviane Hagner, Jessica Linnebach, and Antal Szalai as alumni. In 2006 Zukerman began his involvement in the Rolex Artistic Mentorship programme.\n\n\nZukerman plays the \"Dushkin\" Guarneri del Gesù violin of 1742. His honors include the King Solomon Award, the National Medal of Arts (presented by President Reagan in 1983), the Isaac Stern Award for Artistic Excellence, and an honorary doctorate from Brown University.\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nZukerman married Eugenia Rich in 1968.[6] The couple had two daughters together, opera singer Arianna Zukerman and blues/folk musician Natalia Zukerman.[7][8][9] They frequently appeared together in concert until their separation in 1983. Zukerman was then married to actress Tuesday Weld from 1985 to 2001.[10] He and Weld owned homes in Santa Fe, New Mexico and Montauk, New York, which they bought after the murder-suicide of its previous owners, soap opera actress Gwyda Donhowe and Broadway producer Norman Kean.[11][12] Zukerman and his third wife, cellist Amanda Forsyth, have been married since 2004 and primarily reside in Manhattan. They often appear as soloists together.\n\n\n\n## Recordings[edit]\n\n\nHis recordings have received 21 Grammy nominations, and two Grammy wins.[13] He has collaborated with filmmaker Christopher Nupen on several projects, and was the subject of Nupen's \"Pinchas Zukerman: Here to Make Music\" documentary of 1974. In 2003 he founded a string quintet, the Zukerman Chamber Players, which has released three CD recordings in addition to its roster of live performances.\n\n\n\n## Discography[edit]\n\n\n* 2015: Brahms: Double concerto – Symphony No. 4 (Analekta), AN2 8782\n* 2016: Baroque Treasury (Analekta), AN2 8783\n* 2016: Vaughan Williams & Elgar – Royal Philharmonic Orchestra (Decca)\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Britannica biography\n2. **^** Interview on Youtube\n3. **^** Slonimsky, Nicolas (1978). \"Zukerman, Pinchas\". *Baker's Biographical dictionary of musicians* (6th ed.).

He is Music Director of the Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra and of the New York Philharmonic, and the music director-designate of the Seoul Philharmonic.\n\n\n\n\n## Biography[edit]\n\n\nVan Zweden was born in Amsterdam, Netherlands. His father, a pianist, encouraged him to begin violin studies at age five, and he studied music in Amsterdam. At age 15, he won the Oskar Back violin competition; this allowed him to attend the Juilliard School in the United States where he studied with Dorothy DeLay.[1]\n\n\n\n### Career[edit]\n\n\nIn 1979, at age 18, van Zweden became one of the two first chairs of the Concertgebouw Orchestra. He was the youngest violinist ever to assume that position, which he held until 1995.[*citation needed*] He performed as a soloist with many other orchestras as well.\n\n\nVan Zweden began to work as a conductor after Leonard Bernstein invited him to lead an orchestra rehearsal in Berlin. He has stated that he learned much about conducting from observing the various conductors who led concerts of the Concertgebouw Orchestra. He conducted smaller ensembles initially, and became a full-time conductor in 1997.[2] His first Dutch conducting post was as chief conductor with the Orkest van het Oosten (Orchestra of the East, or the Netherlands Symphony Orchestra) in Enschede, the Netherlands. He served in this post from 1996 through 2000. Van Zweden was chief conductor of the Residentie Orchestra in The Hague from 2000 until 2005, and he recorded the complete symphonies of Ludwig van Beethoven with them. In 2005 he became chief conductor and artistic leader of the Radio Filharmonisch Orkest (RFO; Netherlands Radio Philharmonic) in Hilversum. In February 2007 he extended his RFO contract through 2013.[3] In August 2010, the orchestra announced that van Zweden would step down from the RFO chief conductorship in 2012 and take the position of honorary guest conductor.[4] Van Zweden served as chief conductor of the Antwerp Symphony Orchestra from 2008 to 2011.[5][6]\n\n\nOutside Europe, van Zweden made his U.S. conducting debut with the St. Louis Symphony in 1996. His second US guest-conducting appearance was with the Dallas Symphony Orchestra in February 2006, a concert that was highly acclaimed.[7] Based on this engagement the Dallas Symphony named Van Zweden their next music director after Andrew Litton, effective with the 2008/09 season.[2] His initial contract was for four years, where in the first year he was scheduled to conduct 12 weeks of subscription concerts and then for 15 weeks in the subsequent three years. For the 2007–2008 season, he held the title of music director-designate. In October 2009, the Dallas Symphony announced the extension of his contract through the 2015–2016 season.[8] In November 2013, the orchestra announced a further extension of his contract through 2019.[9] In January 2016, the Dallas Symphony announced a revised conclusion of van Zweden's tenure for the close of the 2017–2018 season, one season earlier than his most recent Dallas contract. With the 2018–2019 season, van Zweden took the title of conductor laureate of the Dallas Symphony, for the period from 2018 until 2021.[10]\n\n\nIn January 2012, the Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra (HK Phil) announced the appointment of van Zweden as its next music director, with an initial contract of four years, starting 1 August 2012.[11] He made his debut as the music director of the orchestra on 28 September 2012.[12] In June 2016, van Zweden extended his contract with the HK Phil through the 2021–2022 season.[13] In June 2020, the HK Phil announced the further extension of van Zweden's contract through the 2023–2024 season, at which time he is scheduled to stand down from the post and to take the title of conductor laureate.[14]\n\n\nVan Zweden first guest-conducted the New York Philharmonic in April 2012.[15] He returned for subsequent engagements in November 2014 and October 2015.[16][17] In January 2016, the New York Philharmonic announced the appointment of van Zweden as its next music director, effective with the 2018/19 season, with an initial contract of five years. Van Zweden served as music director designate for the 2017/18 season.[18] In September 2021, van Zweden said he intended to resign the New York Philharmonic music directorship at the close of the 2023–2024 season.[19]\n\n\nIn September 2022, the Seoul Philharmonic Orchestra announced van Zweden's appointment as its next music director, effective January 2024, with an initial contract of 5 years.[20][21]\n\n\n\n### Personal life[edit]\n\n\nSince 1983, van Zweden has been married to the artist Aaltje van Zweden–van Buuren. They have a daughter, Anna-Sophia, and three sons, Daniel, Benjamin and Alexander.

His festival debut was at age 16.[1] He was in master classes with Nathan Milstein and Max Rostal.[2]\n\n\nIn 1994, Zehetmair formed a string quartet which bears his name. The Zehetmair Quartet performs all works entirely from memory, and learns one new programme a year.[3] Zehetmair has made several recordings for ECM, both as soloist and with his quartet.[2][4]\n\n\nZehetmair later developed a parallel career in conducting. In November 2001, he was named Music Director and chief conductor of the Northern Sinfonia (now the Royal Northern Sinfonia), his first conducting post, starting with the 2002–2003 season, for an initial contract of 3 years and 6 weeks of concerts each season.[5][6] In August 2005, he extended his contract for another 3 years through 2008.[7][8] He concluded his music directorship of the Royal Northern Sinfonia after the 2013–2014 season,[9] and now has the title of conductor laureate with the orchestra. He became an Artistic Partner of the Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra in Minnesota in 2010.[10] In June 2015, the Orchester Musikkollegium Winterthur announced the appointment of Zehetmair as its next principal conductor, effective September 2016, with an initial contract of 3 seasons.[11] He is scheduled to conclude his Winterthur tenure at the close of the 2020–2021 season.[12]\n\n\nIn October 2017, the Stuttgart Chamber Orchestra announced the appointment of Zehetmair as its next chief conductor, effective with the 2019–2020 season, with an initial contract of 3 years.[13] In March 2021, the Orchestre national d'Auvergne announced the appointment of Zehetmair as its next principal conductor, effective with the 2021–2022 season, with an initial contract of 3 years.[14] Since May 2022, he has been Principal Conductor and Artistic Partner of the Irish Chamber Orchestra.[15]\n\n\nZehetmair is married to the violist Ruth Killius,[16] who is also a member of the Zehetmair Quartet. He holds honorary doctorates from the Music Academy Franz Liszt in Weimar and Newcastle University.\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Alfred Hickling (2002-10-04). \"Top of the league\". *The Guardian*.

His father had originally emigrated from Poland to Israel, and his mother's family had settled in Denmark before World War II.[2] His teachers have included Milan Vitek and Boris Kuschnir.\n\n\nIn June 1992, Szeps-Znaider won the first prize of the 4th International Carl Nielsen International Music Competition. In 1995 he was awarded 3rd prize at International Jean Sibelius Violin Competition. In 1997 he became a 1st prize winner of the Queen Elisabeth Music Competition in Brussels. He continued his violin studies with Dorothy DeLay at the Juilliard School of Music.\n\n\nIn his conducting career, Szeps-Znaider counted Sir Colin Davis among his mentors. Szeps-Znaider has held principal guest conductor posts with the Swedish Chamber Orchestra and the Mariinsky Theatre Orchestra.[3] In December 2017, Szeps-Znaider first guest-conducted the Orchestre national de Lyon. In December 2018, the ONL announced the appointment of Szeps-Znaider as its next music director, effective September 2020, with an initial contract of 4 seasons.[4]\n\n\nSzeps-Znaider has made commercial recordings for such labels as RCA Victor Red Seal and LSO Live. His discography includes the following works:\n\n\n\n* The complete Mozart Violin Concertos with the London Symphony Orchestra, directed from the violin[5]\n* Nielsen: Violin Concerto with Alan Gilbert and the New York Philharmonic\n* Elgar: Violin Concerto in B minor, with Sir Colin Davis and the Staatskapelle Dresden\n* Brahms and Korngold: violin concertos, with Valery Gergiev and the Vienna Philharmonic\n* Beethoven and Mendelssohn: violin concertos, with Zubin Mehta and the Israel Philharmonic\n* Prokofiev, Violin Concerto No. 2, and Glazunov, Violin Concerto, with Mariss Jansons and the Bavarian Radio Symphony\n* Felix Mendelssohn: Violin Concerto (DVD) with Riccardo Chailly and the Gewandhaus Orchestra\n* Brahms: chamber music for violin and piano, with Yefim Bronfman\n\n\nSzeps-Znaider spent ten years as Founder and Artistic Director of the annual Nordic Music Academy summer school.

At the age of 22, he won the First Prize at the Paganini Competition in Genoa and the Silver Medal at the Queen Elizabeth Competition. Zhislin's repertoire contains concertos and recitals of all genres, for violin as well as for viola.\n\n\nAs a soloist, Zhislin appeared with the Leningrad/St Petersburg Philharmonic, Moscow Philharmonic, State Symphony Orchestra, RRS (Mailand, Turin), RBC Orchestras (Australian), Staatskapelle Dresden, Gewandhausorchester Leipzig, Vienna Symphonic, Sinfonia Varsovia, Warsaw National Philharmonic, Krakow Philharmonic, Stockholm Radio Orchestra.

In Russia, Zhislin gave the first performance of Penderecki's Violin Concerto; composer and interpreter formed a close relationship; together they recorded all of Penderecki's works for violin and viola. In 1983, following the composer's request, Zhislin began playing the viola in order to give the first performance of Penderecki's Viola Concerto. Penderecki dedicated his *Cadenza per Viola Sola* to Zhislin.\n\n\nOn April 21, 1984, Krzysztof Penderecki himself conducted the premiere of his Concerto for Viola in Leningrad with Grigori Zhislin as soloist. Zhislin also premiered the *Cadenza per Viola Sola* on September 10, 1984, at the country home of Penderecki in Luslawicw, Poland.[1]\n\n\nZhislin was professor of violin and viola at the Royal College of Music in London[2] and taught as professor at the Hochschule für Musik Wuerzburg, Germany until his death.

Samuel was an Armenian hosiery manufacturer and musician from Diyarbakir, Southeastern Anatolia, Turkey, who had been imprisoned by the Turkish authorities in the 1890s as a political activist, and who thereafter relocated to Manchester, England.[1][2] The family settled in Manchester and were prominent cotton merchant businessmen. Ada (née Rushton) came from Birmingham.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nIn the 1920s Samuel and Ada with their children moved to Lytham St Annes. Ada was a Quaker, and they opened a vegetarian guest house there.\n\n\nFrom 1932, Olive studied at the Royal Manchester College of Music under Arthur Catterall, funded first by a scholarship from the College and later by one from Lancashire County Council of £36 a year.[3] When only 16 years old, she was invited by Sir Henry Wood to play at the Promenade season at the Queens Hall, Manchester. She continued her studies at the Royal Academy of Music.[4] In 1937, she was awarded as student prize a violin bow made by J & A Beare,[5] the first of many awards and prizes. Also in 1937, a string quartet which consisted of her (violin I), Marjorie Lavers (violin II), Susan Davies (viola) and Vivian Joseph (cello) won the Sir Edward Cooper Prize for ensemble playing.[6]\n\n\nZorian then studied violin with Georges Enescu in Paris and with Szymon Goldberg in Amsterdam.[7]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nIn 1938, she was leader (concertmaster) of an orchestra assembled by Rudolph Dolmetsch.[8]\n\n\nShe performed five times as soloist at The Proms, in London, 1940–47,[9] at the invitation of Sir Henry Wood. In one of those performances, in 1943, she gave the first performance in England of *Saudade* for violin and orchestra by South African composer Arnold van Wyk (1916–83).[10]\n\n\nIn 1942, she founded the Zorian String Quartet, in which she played first violin. The other founding members were Marjorie Lavers (violin II), Winifred Copperwheat (1905–76, viola) and Norina Semino (cello).[4][11][12] The quartet gave the premiere performances of, and made the first recordings of, several string quartets by English composers, including Benjamin Britten and Michael Tippett, and gave the English premieres of others.[13] The quartet was also famous for its performances of string quartets by Bartok and Bloch, as well as modern music.\n\n\nWhen the re-formed Zorian String Quartet diminished its activity, she led the English Opera Group Orchestra 1952–57, including performances at the Aldeburgh Festival. She was a distinguished violinist in the Julian Bream Consort,[13] which was responsible for a revival of Elizabethan music. She made recordings with both those groups as well as with the Zorian Quartet. As a soloist she gave numerous recitals, and played concertos with leading British orchestras. In 1961, she was leader of the Hoffnung Symphony Orchestra at the Hoffnung Astronautical Music Festival.[14]\n\n\n\nIn 1985, her former husband John Amis wrote, in his autobiography *Amiscellany*:\n\n\n> Olive's own playing was not virtuosic, though she could most capably negotiate things like Mozart concertos, the first fiddle-parts of Britten, Bartók and Tippett, as well as Stravinsky's *Duo Concertant*. Her strongest point was her instinctive musicianship and, above all, her ability to float and spin a line. You can hear the best of her in the old 78 rpm recordings of Britten [namely, his Second String Quartet] and Tippett Second String Quartets and, on LP, the original recordings of Britten's *Saint Nicolas* and *The Turn of the Screw*.[13]\n> \n> \n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nIn 1948, she married broadcaster and classical music critic John Amis (1922–2013). The marriage was dissolved in 1955,[13] the same year in which her father died. \n\n\n\n## Death and legacy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The grave of Olive Zorian and her family in Southern Cemetery, Manchester\nOlive Zorian died of cancer in hospital in London in 1965.[1] Her name is inscribed in the Book of Remembrance in the Musicians' Chapel at St Sepulchre-without-Newgate, London.[15]\n\n\nFor many years Zorian played on a 1721 Gagliano violin, which upon her death was bequeathed to the daughter of Athur Catheral, her former tutor, to whom it originally belonged. Later, a fund in her name was set up to acquire it for the Royal Manchester College of Music for students to borrow for a year each. Jonathon Sparey of Cumberland was the first recipient. Two memorial concerts in November 1966 (the first in London on the 23rd, featuring Benjamin Britten, Peter Pears, Julian Bream, Helen Watts, Manoug Parikian, Norman Del Mar and Harold Lester;[16] the second in Manchester, featuring John Ogdon and his wife Brenda Lucas, Elizabeth Harwood, Rodney Friend and Isobel Flinn) raised more than the necessary amount. The instrument was stolen in 1969 and has not been recovered.[3]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** George, Joan (2002). *Merchants in Exile: The Armenians in Manchester, England, 1835–1935*.

These images are located in the Leslieville district, next to a TD Bank at Queen St. East and Logan Avenue and below Queen St. East on Connaught Avenue, as part of a neighborhood beautification project conducted by the Toronto Transit Commission.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nNash's music is a complex blend of progressive rock, New Wave, new age, and punk rock, using electric mandolins, violins, drum machines, and a variety of effects and sonic devices. He wrote, played, and produced most of the material on his solo albums by himself, though he also worked with producers Daniel Lanois, Steve Hillage, and Bill Nelson.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### First group[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n## Death[edit]\n\n\nOn May 10, 2014, Nash died at his home in Toronto, at age 66, from a suspected heart attack.[15][16] Robert Vanderhorst confirmed his death to the media two days later.[15]\n\n\n\n### Legacy[edit]\n\n\nSince his death in 2014, Nash the Slash's career and recordings are being preserved by The Nash the Slash Legacy. His website was relaunched late in 2014, and costumes and instruments were donated to the National Music Centre in Calgary. He was declared a Canadian Innovator by NMC and his Vladimir Bosnar custom skull mandolin is on display in the Canadian Music Hall of Fame wing. A distribution deal was signed with Artoffact Records in Toronto in early 2015 to release all six of his albums from the 1980s - Bedside Companion, Dreams and Nightmares, Children of the Night, the rare and previously commercially unreleased live album Hammersmith Holocaust, Decomposing, as well as And You Thought You Were Normal?. Work is underway to have all his albums available again by late 2018.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn later years, he attempted to keep his true identity the subject of some speculation, although the *Star* profile of 1978 had already matter-of-factly revealed his real name.[7] Nevertheless, in a 1981 interview with the UK magazine *Smash Hits*, Nash was questioned about his real name, and replied with \"Nashville Thebodiah Slasher\".[*citation needed*] As a result of his coyness about his name, some fans came to believe that the Nash persona was an alter-ego of Ben Mink, who replaced him as FM's violinist in 1978. This is a common misconception, but he has been photographed onstage with Mink.[8][*original research?*]\n\n\nThe \"Nash the Slash\" persona came from silent film, and Nash said he took his stage name from that of a killer butler encountered by Laurel and Hardy in one of their first films, *Do Detectives Think?* (1927), for which he composed a soundtrack score.[*citation needed*]\n(The film character's name is actually \"The Tipton Slasher\"; nowhere on screen does \"Nash the Slash\" appear.)[9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Nash the Slash performing at The Venue in London in 1981\nNash also played on three songs by Toronto group Drastic Measures for their self-titled album, including violins on their signature tune, a cover version of the children's song, \"The Teddy Bears' Picnic\". Nash's label, Cut-throat Records, later issued a single by the group, the only other artist to appear on his label, although Nash was not involved in its recording. Nash's later soundtrack album for *Highway 61* includes tracks by Tony Malone, the lead singer for Drastic Measures.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Nash the Slash's Gravesite: Latest News\". *nashtheslash.com*. 2012-11-06.

The bandages became his trademark.\"[5][6] Prior to 1979, Nash performed three times on TV Ontario's *Nightmusic Concert*, first as a solo artist (a live broadcast which was never re-aired), then with FM (Nash and Cameron Hawkins), and again as a solo artist. In all of these appearances Nash wore his typical black tuxedo, top hat, and dark sunglasses, but not his signature bandages. He was also photographed in this attire for a profile in the *Toronto Star*, published April 28, 1978.[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring 1992-3 Nash the Slash collaborated with the electronic music artist Plexus to create a series of visually intense live shows called Psychedelitron. They performed Psychedelitron live between 1993–1995. In 1993, the show was performed only at Stratenger's in Toronto, Canada, every third Saturday of the month from March to October. The performed two sets, each a mix of Nash the Slash and Plexus songs. Later, in 1994 and 1995, they took the show to other venues, including the grand opening of the Toronto Public Library at 239 College Street to commemorate the inclusion of the Merril Collection of Science Fiction, Speculation & Fantasy in this library location.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBefore working as a solo artist, Nash recorded an unreleased song called \"Slasher\" with a group called Breathless, which also included his (and FM's) future producer, Michael Waite on bass guitar. The song appeared on a \"various artists\" promotional album titled *Concept* (after the Toronto-based management company, Concept 376; this was one of a series of such albums), but was not issued to the public in any form. The promo album does not list the group's personnel, or even a songwriting credit, but Nash is clearly heard singing a song, beginning with the lyrics \"Hear the children of the night\" (though this was a completely different song from his later work, \"Children of the Night\"), and playing electric violin. The song also featured a complex organ solo not in Nash's usual style (nor that of Cameron Hawkins, his bandmate in FM).[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### First solo career and film work[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_CVlTksy9aQ2UM2smIvZObdWZ","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

He studied music and learned to play the violin with his father and at the Chicago Cosmopolitan Conservatory of Music. At the age of 12, he debuted with the Chicago Symphony orchestra playing the Mendelssohn concerto. He went to the Prague Conservatory in Czechoslovakia to further his violin studies.[3]\n\n\nWhen he returned to the United States, he joined the music staff of Chicago's NBC and WGN radio stations. After 2+1⁄2 years in the Army Medical Corps as a private and a corporal, he resumed his musical career in Washington, D.C. at the Mayflower Hotel. Television's Arthur Godfrey discovered him there, and ZaBach appeared on Godfrey's show several times. He also appeared on most of the television shows emanating from New York at the time: Ed Sullivan, Milton Berle, Ken Murray, Red Skelton, Steve Allen, Jack Paar and 25 appearances on The Tonight Show. For over a year he performed five one-hour shows daily, seven days a week as master of ceremonies, orchestra conductor and violin soloist on the stage of Strand Theatre on Broadway.[3]\n\n\nZaBach then moved to Hollywood, where he filmed the \"Florian ZaBach\" show, a weekly half-hour television series that was syndicated nationwide in more than 90 markets and in major cities throughout the world. He also appeared with major symphony orchestras as soloist and conductor on their pops concerts in the United States and in London, Vienna, Genoa, Venice, Australia[6] and Beijing, among other concert halls.[3]\n\n\nZaBach recorded many albums for Mercury and Decca using his 1732 Guarnerius del Gesu violin, created in Cremona, Italy.[3] including million-seller \"The Hot Canary\" on Decca in 1951 and a minor hit \"When The White Lilacs Bloom Again' on Mercury in 1956.[7]\n\n\nZaBach spent the later years of his life living and working in Clarks Summit, Pennsylvania. His compositions and musical arrangements were donated to the Florian ZaBach Papers in the Library of Congress in August 2005. He died at Scranton, Pennsylvania on February 25, 2006.[8]\n\n\n\n## Discography[edit]\n\n\nA partial listing of his recordings follows.\n\n\n\n### Vinyl LPs[edit]\n\n\n* *Golden Strings*[9]\n* *Hi-Fi Fiddle*[10]\n* *The Hot Canary*  (1951)[11][9][10]\n* *Hour of Love*[9]\n* *String Along With ZaBach*\n* *Till the End of Time* (m) (1958)[9][10]\n* *It's Easy to Dance With Florian ZaBach* (m) (1959)[9]\n* *Do It Yourself Wedding Album* (June Valli & Florian ZaBach) (1959)[9]\n* *With the Nashville Country Strings*[9]\n* *Till the End of Time* (s) (1959)[9][10]\n* *It's Easy to Dance With Florian ZaBach* (s) (1960)[9]\n\n### Vinyl 45s[edit]\n\n\n* \"April in Portugal\"[9][10]\n* \"Dream of Romance\"[10]\n* \"Fiddler's Boogie\"[9][10]\n* \"Jalousie\"[10]\n* \"Oceans of Love\"[10]\n* \"Petticoats of Portugal\"[10]\n* \"Pussy Footin'\"[10]\n* \"Runaway Romance\"[10]\n* \"Rainbow Trail\"[10]\n* \"Red Canary\"[9][10]\n* \"Red Wing\"[10]\n* \"Running off the Rails\"[10]\n* \"Tea for Two\"[10]\n* \"Waltzing Cat\"[10]\n* \"When the White Lilacs Bloom Again\" (1956)[2][9][10]\n* \"Whistler and His Dog\"[10]\n\n### Vinyl 78s[edit]\n\n\n* *Red Canary*/*April in Portugal*[12]\n* *Fiddler's Boogie*[10]\n\n## References and notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Birth year is per Social Security Death Index Interactive Search at [1].

What mostly attracts attention are his solo and chamber music projects (the complete Bach Sonatas and Partitas for solo violin or Beethoven and Brahms Sonatas from recent seasons). He is also appreciated for his taste and style and for his captivatingly beautiful tone.\n\n\n\n\n## Life[edit]\n\n\nŽenatý was born on 2 February 1962 in Lomnice nad Popelkou. The violinist began his professional career with his participation in the finale of the International Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow, followed by his debut with the Czech Philharmonic and Libor Pešek and his first prize at the Prague Spring Competition. He earned the title of laureate at the UNESCO International Rostrum of Young Performers (1989). in 1990 Mr. Ženatý made his debut in London, in 1991 at the Berliner Philharmonie and the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam, in 1994 in Tokyo and in 1996 in New York and Buenos Aires. He has collaborated with Yehudi Menuhin, Yo-Yo Ma, Serge Baudo, Valery Gergiev, Andrey Boreyko, Neville Marriner and many others.\n\n\nThe musicianship of Ženatý has been influenced the most by his personal encounters with Nathan Milstein, Ruggiero Ricci and André Gertler, and a major change to his musical thinking was initiated by professor Bezrodny at the Tchaikovsky Conservatory in Moscow. What he valuate at most, however, have been his private lessons with Josef Suk and many subsequent years of their collaboration, climaxing with performances at the Mozart Festival Würzburg and the Prague Spring Festival and with a recording of the complete works of W. A. Mozart.\n\n\nHe has recorded the complete violin works of composers Telemann, Bach, Mendelssohn, Schumann, Schulhoff, Dvořák and Grieg.[1] His new complete Dvořák recording has attracted attention, as well as has his recording of both violin concertos by J. B. Foerster with the BBC Symphony Orchestra and its music director Jiří Bělohlávek.[2]\n\n\nŽenatý played on Giuseppe Guarneri's violin Prince of Orange. Now he plays on another Guarneri violin made in 1740.\n\n\nŽenatý has taught at Cleveland Institute of Music, Royal Danish Academy of Music and Hochschule für Musik Carl Maria von Weber in Dresden.\n\n\n\n## Awards[edit]\n\n\n* 1982 - Finalist of the International Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow\n* 1987 - Winner of the International Prague Spring Violin Competition\n* 1989 - Laureate of the International Tribune of Young Performers UNESCO\n* 1990 - Main prize of the Ruggiero Ricci international master-classes in Berlin\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Schrade, Rorianne. \"Legato Arts Presents Ivan Ženatý in Review\". *New York Concert Review, Inc*.

He was born in Beijing, China.\n\n\nZhong, one of the last private pupils of Russian violin pedagogue Raphael Bronstein, also studied with Bronstein's student Elmar Oliveira. Zhong's violin prowess was recognized at age 14 by renowned violinist Nathan Milstein, and led to a series of concerts promoted and arranged by Milstein's manager Harold Shaw in United States, including a debut at New York's Carnegie Hall main stage at age 16. After which, he went on performing as a soloist and, more often, recitalist in cities of North and South America, Western Europe, and Asia. He is noted for his instrumental fluency and artistic insight that delivers incisive and noble musical interpretations.\n\n\nBorn to a family of professional violinists, Zhong started violin lessons around age four with his parents. His progress was quick enough that at age 11 he won a national audition with the fiendish Paganini Violin Concerto No. 1 and the prolific Ciaconne by Bach. This earned him a place in the studio of veteran violin professor Ke Qiang Sui at the Central Conservatory of Music in Beijing. Zhong traveled to the United States alone to pursue studies at age 13. He was accepted as a pupil by Raphael Bronstein, who also offered the young boy shelter along with scholarship. Zhong lived and studied at Bronstein's home until the professor's death, and continued to work with Ariana Bronne, Bronstein's daughter, until he had earned his Bachelor of Music degree at Manhattan School of Music in New York City. Afterward, Zhong sought Bronstein's famed student Elmar Oliveira for further advice and obtained a Master of Fine Arts degree at State University of New York at Purchase.\n\n\nZhong performs in a number of professional orchestras in North California. Notably, he is the Associate Concertmaster in Santa Rosa Symphony, and Concertmaster at the Mendocino Music Festival. As a violin instructor, Zhong has held professorship at Western Illinois University (2002-2004) and California State University, Los Angeles (2004-2009), and taught master-classes in universities in North America, South America, and China. Zhong is the author of the violin instruction book A Violinist's Handbook, A Simpler Manual to Learn the Instrument, a method manual that combines the Leopold Auer Violin School guidelines with his own findings in practical solutions. He became a U.S. citizen in 2000.\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n* http://www.iuniverse.com iUniverse Publications, Inc.\n* http://www.msmnyc.edu/ouralumni Manhattan School of Music Alumni Association\n\n\n## External links[edit]\n\n\n* Elmar Oliveira, violinist\n* CD baby\n* Manhattan School of Music\n* SUNY Purchase\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Raphael Bronstein\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Authority control databases: Artists ![Edit this at Wikidata](image) | * MusicBrainz\n |\n\n</content>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_MZHtpzDgEZ1Hwe4uxgjeCiji","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

Following World War II, he returned to Juilliard for additional studies, with such teachers as Sascha Jacobsen, Louis Persinger, and Ivan Galamian.[3]\n\n\nThe composers Gunther Schuller, Paul Ben-Haim and Carlos Surinach composed violin concertos for Zeitlin, who premiered them. Zeitlin was the first to record George Rochberg's Caprice Variations in their entirety. He was also a particular champion of the violin concerto of Arnold Schoenberg and recorded this work commercially for Deutsche Grammophon.[1]\n\n\nZeitlin taught for 45 years at the University of Rochester's Eastman School of Music, from 1967 until his death in 2012. He gave his final recital at Eastman just before his 90th birthday.[4] During his time at Eastman, he, pianist Barry Snyder, and cellist Robert Sylvester founded the Eastman Trio, and Zeitlin performed with this trio from 1976 to 1982. He also taught summer courses at the Music Academy of the West in California, starting in 1973.[1][3] From 1962 to 2002, he performed on a rare Cremonese violin by Giuseppe Guarneri *del Gesù*, the 1734 \"Prince Doria\", which was initially gifted to him by the Lionello Perera family, before switching to a replica by the contemporary American violinmaker, Gregg T. Alf.\n\n\nZeitlin and his wife Marianne Langner Zeitlin were married for 61 years. The couple had 2 children, Hillel and Leora. His widow and children, his sister Anba Kantor, and six grandchildren and two great-grandchildren survive him.[1]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** Margalit Fox (2012-05-04). \"Zvi Zeitlin, Violinist Who Championed Modernist Composers, Dies at 90\". *New York Times*.

What mostly attracts attention are his solo and chamber music projects (the complete Bach Sonatas and Partitas for solo violin or Beethoven and Brahms Sonatas from recent seasons). He is also appreciated for his taste and style and for his captivatingly beautiful tone.\n\n\n\n\n## Life[edit]\n\n\nŽenatý was born on 2 February 1962 in Lomnice nad Popelkou. The violinist began his professional career with his participation in the finale of the International Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow, followed by his debut with the Czech Philharmonic and Libor Pešek and his first prize at the Prague Spring Competition. He earned the title of laureate at the UNESCO International Rostrum of Young Performers (1989). in 1990 Mr. Ženatý made his debut in London, in 1991 at the Berliner Philharmonie and the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam, in 1994 in Tokyo and in 1996 in New York and Buenos Aires. He has collaborated with Yehudi Menuhin, Yo-Yo Ma, Serge Baudo, Valery Gergiev, Andrey Boreyko, Neville Marriner and many others.\n\n\nThe musicianship of Ženatý has been influenced the most by his personal encounters with Nathan Milstein, Ruggiero Ricci and André Gertler, and a major change to his musical thinking was initiated by professor Bezrodny at the Tchaikovsky Conservatory in Moscow. What he valuate at most, however, have been his private lessons with Josef Suk and many subsequent years of their collaboration, climaxing with performances at the Mozart Festival Würzburg and the Prague Spring Festival and with a recording of the complete works of W. A. Mozart.\n\n\nHe has recorded the complete violin works of composers Telemann, Bach, Mendelssohn, Schumann, Schulhoff, Dvořák and Grieg.[1] His new complete Dvořák recording has attracted attention, as well as has his recording of both violin concertos by J. B. Foerster with the BBC Symphony Orchestra and its music director Jiří Bělohlávek.[2]\n\n\nŽenatý played on Giuseppe Guarneri's violin Prince of Orange. Now he plays on another Guarneri violin made in 1740.\n\n\nŽenatý has taught at Cleveland Institute of Music, Royal Danish Academy of Music and Hochschule für Musik Carl Maria von Weber in Dresden.\n\n\n\n## Awards[edit]\n\n\n* 1982 - Finalist of the International Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow\n* 1987 - Winner of the International Prague Spring Violin Competition\n* 1989 - Laureate of the International Tribune of Young Performers UNESCO\n* 1990 - Main prize of the Ruggiero Ricci international master-classes in Berlin\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Schrade, Rorianne. \"Legato Arts Presents Ivan Ženatý in Review\". *New York Concert Review, Inc*.

He did a significant amount of recording in Japan and had long associations, especially with composers Jo Kondo and Yuji Takahashi. In 2006 he moved permanently to Asia, initially to Bangkok and then for the last decade of his life in Hong Kong, where he continued to be musically active and also worked on his inimitable critical writings, mostly on music. Zukofsky died of non-Hodgkin lymphoma on June 6, 2017, in Hong Kong. He left no immediate survivors.[19]\n\n\n\n## Works[edit]\n\n\n### Writings[edit]\n\n\n* Zukofsky, Paul (1976). \"On Violin Harmonics.\" In *Perspectives on Notation and Performance* ed.

ISBN 978-0-393-02190-5.\n\n\n### Selected discography[edit]\n\n\nA more detailed discography is available at the Musical Observations website.[20]\n\n\n\n#### As violinist[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHe made his first orchestral appearance in 1952 with the New Haven Symphony Orchestra, and a formal debut recital at Carnegie Hall in 1956.[2] *The New York Times* praised his technique, noting he had gone through \"a difficult program without turning a hair or moving a facial muscle\" and described him as a \"deadpan bundle of talent.\"[3] Further Carnegie Hall recitals followed in 1959 and 1961.[4][5] Louis Zukofsky published a fictionalized biography of his son as a young violinist, *Little* (1970), which includes an account of the ten-year-old Paul Zukofsky playing for the poet Ezra Pound, who was then incarcerated in St. Elizabeths prison-asylum in Washington, D.C.[6]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFrom 1992 to 1996, Zukofsky was director of the Arnold Schoenberg Institute at the University of Southern California. During this time a dispute between Schoenberg's heirs and the university concerning the mission of the institute resulted in the relocation and rehousing of the Schoenberg's archive at the Arnold Schönberg Center in Vienna, Austria, in 1998.[16]\n\n\n\n## Recordings[edit]\n\n\nZukofsky recorded extensively as both violinist and conductor. These include some notable renditions of classics, such as Paganini's *Twenty-four Caprices* and Bach's *Sonatas and Partitas for Violin.* In 1974 he recorded an anthology of new American violin music composed between 1940 and 1970, and the following year interpretations of classic rags. However, his primary focus was on contemporary classical music and with always an interest in championing work he believed was underappreciated, such as that of Artur Schnabel and Armin Loos.\n\n\n\n## Executor[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBorn in Brooklyn, New York, Paul Zukofsky was the only child of the American objectivist poet Louis Zukofsky and Celia Thaew Zukofsky, a musician and composer. Both parents were children of Yiddish-speaking immigrants from what was then the western Russian Empire (now Belarus).[1] Revealing a precocious talent, he began taking music lessons at age three, soon concentrated on the violin, and at seven became a student of Ivan Galamian at the Juilliard School of Music. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n7. **^** For a lively portrait of Zukofsky and his multi-faceted activities in the late 1960s, see Richard Kostelanetz (2004). \"Paul Zukofsky (1969)\", *On Innovative Music(ian)s*.

As one succinct description puts it: \"From his earliest years he was fascinated by ultramodern music and developed maximal celerity, dexterity, and alacrity in manipulating special techniques, in effect transforming the violin into a multimedia instrument beyond its normal capacities.\"[2][7] He is best known for his performances of and collaborations with many of the key composers of contemporary classical music, such as Milton Babbitt, Arthur Berger, Easley Blackwood, Henry Brant, John Cage, Elliott Carter, George Crumb, Morton Feldman, Philip Glass, Peter Mennin, Krzysztof Penderecki, Walter Piston, J. K. Randall, Wallingford Riegger, Giacinto Scelsi, Artur Schnabel, Roger Sessions, Ralph Shapey, Harvey Sollberger, Stefan Wolpe, Charles Wuorinen, and Iannis Xenakis. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs a teacher, Zukofsky taught at many major music schools and programs, including the Juilliard School (where he taught chamber music, conducting and violin), the New England Conservatory, the Berkshire Music Center, the Manhattan School of Music, and Stony Brook University. He was one of the original Creative Associates at the founding of the Center for Creative and Performing Arts, SUNY Buffalo, in 19674. Zukofsky served as artistic director for the Museum of Modern Art (NYC) Summergarden concert series from 1987 to 1992, and he was program coordinator of the American Composer Series at the Kennedy Center from 1980 until 1990.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHe gave world premieres of concertos by Roger Sessions (for violin, cello and orchestra), Charles Wuorinen (for amplified violin and orchestra), Morton Feldman (for violin and orchestra), Philip Glass, and the Scottish composer Iain Hamilton, among others.\n\n\nZukofsky appeared as the character of Albert Einstein in Philip Glass's opera *Einstein on the Beach* in 1976, and performed on a number of other Glass recordings.[8] He also had a significant collaborative relationship with John Cage. They worked together and recorded the violin version of Cage's *Cheap Imitation* (1977), and Cage composed the demanding *Freeman Etudes – Books I and II* (Etudes I–XVII, 1977–1980) specifically for Zukofsky.[9][10][11][12]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOver the course of the 1970s, Zukofsky increasingly devoted his energies to conducting. From 1978 to 1987 he was conductor of the Colonial Symphony Orchestra (Madison, New Jersey). In the mid-1970s Zukofsky initiated what proved to be a long-standing musical association with Iceland. In 1977, he led the Zukofsky Seminars in Orchestral Music offering the opportunity for music students to perform large scale works. These evolved into the founding in 1985 of the Youth Symphony Orchestra of Iceland (Sinfóníuhljómsveit Æskunnar) of which he was Principal Conductor and Music Director until 1993, giving a large number of Icelandic premieres of primarily 20th century orchestral music.[15] In recognition of his long-standing association with and contributions to Icelandic music, Zukofsky received the Minningarverðlaun D.V. (Cultural Achievement Award in Music) in 1988, as well as the Knight's Cross, Icelandic Order of the Falcon by the President of Iceland in 1990.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Musical Observations, Inc. website, including many recordings for free download, an extensive collection of writings and biographical information.\n* \"Paul Zukofsky\", June 21, 2017, critical responses by Mark Liberman to Fox's *New York Times* obituary\n\n\nPortals:* ![](image) Biography\n* ![](image) Classical music\n\n| Authority control databases ![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\n |\n| --- |\n| International | * FAST\n* ISNI\n* VIAF\n* WorldCat\n |\n| National | * Norway\n* Spain\n* France\n* BnF data\n* Germany\n* Israel\n* United States\n* Netherlands\n* Poland\n |\n| Artists | * Grammy Awards\n* MusicBrainz\n |\n| Other | * SNAC\n* IdRef\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1975 Zukofsky founded Musical Observations, a nonprofit corporation to support neglected but worthwhile projects, including the recording label CP2, which continues to make available many recordings for which he performed, conducted and edited.[13] From 1976 to 1977, Zukofsky was a resident visitor at the Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill, New Jersey, participating in research on timing in musical performance.[14]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs the copyright holder for his parents' work, Zukofsky gained a reputation as a restrictive and contentious guardian of his property rights, joining a list of literary estates that have taken a controlling and often confrontational position with regard to scholars, of which perhaps the most notorious has been the James Joyce estate.[17] In 2009 he published a provocative open letter online discouraging students and scholars from publishing on his father's work. The letter evidences his strong animus against academics and suspicion of their motives. On the other hand, he kept the considerable body of his father's work in print and supported the publication of several volumes of correspondence, so that there has been far better access to the work than at any time during his father's lifetime. Zukofsky's narrow interpretation of fair use has been strongly contested by legal scholars.[18]\n\n\n\n## Death[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Morton Feldman: *Spring of Chosroes* / Artur Schnabel: *Sonata for Violin and Piano* (1981).\n* Edward Steuermann: *Dialogues for Violin Solo*; *Improvisation and Allegro* (1981).\n* John Cage: *Freeman Etudes I–VII* (1983).\n* Philip Glass: *The Photographer* (violin solos) (1983).\n* *New Music from the University of Iowa*.

His father had originally emigrated from Poland to Israel, and his mother's family had settled in Denmark before World War II.[2] His teachers have included Milan Vitek and Boris Kuschnir.\n\n\nIn June 1992, Szeps-Znaider won the first prize of the 4th International Carl Nielsen International Music Competition. In 1995 he was awarded 3rd prize at International Jean Sibelius Violin Competition. In 1997 he became a 1st prize winner of the Queen Elisabeth Music Competition in Brussels. He continued his violin studies with Dorothy DeLay at the Juilliard School of Music.\n\n\nIn his conducting career, Szeps-Znaider counted Sir Colin Davis among his mentors. Szeps-Znaider has held principal guest conductor posts with the Swedish Chamber Orchestra and the Mariinsky Theatre Orchestra.[3] In December 2017, Szeps-Znaider first guest-conducted the Orchestre national de Lyon. In December 2018, the ONL announced the appointment of Szeps-Znaider as its next music director, effective September 2020, with an initial contract of 4 seasons.[4]\n\n\nSzeps-Znaider has made commercial recordings for such labels as RCA Victor Red Seal and LSO Live. His discography includes the following works:\n\n\n\n* The complete Mozart Violin Concertos with the London Symphony Orchestra, directed from the violin[5]\n* Nielsen: Violin Concerto with Alan Gilbert and the New York Philharmonic\n* Elgar: Violin Concerto in B minor, with Sir Colin Davis and the Staatskapelle Dresden\n* Brahms and Korngold: violin concertos, with Valery Gergiev and the Vienna Philharmonic\n* Beethoven and Mendelssohn: violin concertos, with Zubin Mehta and the Israel Philharmonic\n* Prokofiev, Violin Concerto No. 2, and Glazunov, Violin Concerto, with Mariss Jansons and the Bavarian Radio Symphony\n* Felix Mendelssohn: Violin Concerto (DVD) with Riccardo Chailly and the Gewandhaus Orchestra\n* Brahms: chamber music for violin and piano, with Yefim Bronfman\n\n\nSzeps-Znaider spent ten years as Founder and Artistic Director of the annual Nordic Music Academy summer school. He is now President of the Carl Nielsen Competition. He is also Viotti Visiting Professor of Music at the Royal Academy of Music, London.[6]\n\n\nSzeps-Znaider plays the Guarneri “del Gesu” violin, built in 1741, on extended loan to him by The Royal Danish Theater through the generosity of the VELUX Foundations, the Villum Fonden and the Knud Højgaard Foundation. Previously played by Fritz Kreisler, the violin is thus known as the \"Ex-Kreisler Guarnerius\".\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Szeps-Znaider has also used the name 'Nikolaj Znaider' professionally in the past.\n2. **^** Duchen, Jessica (November 23, 2010). \"Interview: Nikolaj Znaider\".

What mostly attracts attention are his solo and chamber music projects (the complete Bach Sonatas and Partitas for solo violin or Beethoven and Brahms Sonatas from recent seasons). He is also appreciated for his taste and style and for his captivatingly beautiful tone.\n\n\n\n\n## Life[edit]\n\n\nŽenatý was born on 2 February 1962 in Lomnice nad Popelkou. The violinist began his professional career with his participation in the finale of the International Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow, followed by his debut with the Czech Philharmonic and Libor Pešek and his first prize at the Prague Spring Competition. He earned the title of laureate at the UNESCO International Rostrum of Young Performers (1989). in 1990 Mr. Ženatý made his debut in London, in 1991 at the Berliner Philharmonie and the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam, in 1994 in Tokyo and in 1996 in New York and Buenos Aires. He has collaborated with Yehudi Menuhin, Yo-Yo Ma, Serge Baudo, Valery Gergiev, Andrey Boreyko, Neville Marriner and many others.\n\n\nThe musicianship of Ženatý has been influenced the most by his personal encounters with Nathan Milstein, Ruggiero Ricci and André Gertler, and a major change to his musical thinking was initiated by professor Bezrodny at the Tchaikovsky Conservatory in Moscow. What he valuate at most, however, have been his private lessons with Josef Suk and many subsequent years of their collaboration, climaxing with performances at the Mozart Festival Würzburg and the Prague Spring Festival and with a recording of the complete works of W. A. Mozart.\n\n\nHe has recorded the complete violin works of composers Telemann, Bach, Mendelssohn, Schumann, Schulhoff, Dvořák and Grieg.[1] His new complete Dvořák recording has attracted attention, as well as has his recording of both violin concertos by J. B. Foerster with the BBC Symphony Orchestra and its music director Jiří Bělohlávek.[2]\n\n\nŽenatý played on Giuseppe Guarneri's violin Prince of Orange. Now he plays on another Guarneri violin made in 1740.\n\n\nŽenatý has taught at Cleveland Institute of Music, Royal Danish Academy of Music and Hochschule für Musik Carl Maria von Weber in Dresden.\n\n\n\n## Awards[edit]\n\n\n* 1982 - Finalist of the International Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow\n* 1987 - Winner of the International Prague Spring Violin Competition\n* 1989 - Laureate of the International Tribune of Young Performers UNESCO\n* 1990 - Main prize of the Ruggiero Ricci international master-classes in Berlin\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Schrade, Rorianne. \"Legato Arts Presents Ivan Ženatý in Review\". *New York Concert Review, Inc*.
