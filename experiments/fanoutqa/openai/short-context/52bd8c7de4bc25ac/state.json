This was the first increment in the primary version number of macOS since the release of Mac OS X Public Beta in 2000; updates to macOS 11 were given 11.x numbers, matching the version numbering scheme used by Apple's other operating systems. Big Sur brought major changes to the UI and was the first version to run on the ARM instruction set.[51] The new numbering system was continued in 2021 with macOS 12 Monterey, 2022 with macOS 13 Ventura, and 2023 with macOS 14 Sonoma.\n\n\n\n### Timeline of releases[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA prominent part of macOS's original brand identity was the use of Roman numeral X, pronounced \"ten\", as well as code naming each release after species of big cats, or places within California.[7] Apple shortened the name to \"OS X\" in 2011 and then changed it to \"macOS\" in 2016 to align with the branding of Apple's other operating systems, iOS, watchOS, and tvOS.[8] After sixteen distinct versions of macOS 10, macOS Big Sur was presented as version 11 in 2020, and every subsequent version has also incremented the major version number.\n\n\nmacOS has supported three major processor architectures, beginning with PowerPC-based Macs in 1999. In 2006, Apple transitioned to the Intel architecture with a line of Macs using Intel Core processors. In 2020, Apple began the Apple silicon transition, using self-designed, 64-bit ARM-based Apple M series processors on the latest Macintosh computers.[9] As of 2023[update], the most recent release of macOS is macOS 14 Sonoma.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Development[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t* \"macOS version 12.0 Monterey on Intel-based Mac computers\".

The park was established on September 25, 1890, and today protects 404,064 acres (631\u00a0sq\u00a0mi; 163,519\u00a0ha; 1,635\u00a0km2)[2] of forested mountainous terrain. Encompassing a vertical relief of nearly 13,000 feet (4,000\u00a0m), the park contains the highest point in the contiguous United States, Mount Whitney, at 14,505 feet (4,421\u00a0m) above sea level.[4] The park is south of, and contiguous with, Kings Canyon National Park; both parks are administered by the National Park Service together as Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks.

The park's mountainous landscape includes the tallest mountain in the contiguous United States, Mount Whitney, which rises to 14,505 feet (4,421\u00a0m) above sea level.[32] The Great Western Divide parallels the Sierran crest and is visible at various places in the park, for example, Mineral King, Moro Rock, and the Giant Forest. Peaks in the Great Western Divide rise to more than 12,000 feet (3,700\u00a0m). Deep canyons lie between the mountains, including Tokopah Valley above Lodgepole, Deep Canyon on the Marble Fork of the Kaweah River, and Kern Canyon in the park's backcountry, which is more than 5,000 feet (1,500\u00a0m) deep for 30 miles (50\u00a0km).[33]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAccording to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification system, Sequoia National Park encompasses five climate types listed here from highest to lowest elevation; Tundra (*ET*), Mediterranean-influenced Subarctic climate (*Dsc*), Mediterranean-influenced warm-summer Humid continental climate (*Dsb*), Warm-summer Mediterranean climate (*Csb*), and Hot-summer Mediterranean climate (*Csa*). Precipitation also decreases with elevation. According to the United States Department of Agriculture, the Plant Hardiness zone at Giant Forest Visitor Center (6,444\u00a0ft (1,964\u00a0m)) is 8a with an average annual extreme minimum temperature of 12.0\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221211.1\u00a0\u00b0C).[26]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nSequoia National Park\n |\n| --- |\n| Giant sequoias | * Atwell Mill Grove\n* Franklin Tree\n* Garfield Grove\n* General Sherman Tree\n* Giant Forest\n* Hazelwood Tree\n* King Arthur\n* Lincoln Tree\n* Mark Twain Tree\n* Muir Grove\n* President\n* Tharp's Log\n* Washington Tree\n | ![Hamilton Lake](image)\n |\n| Mountains | * Alta Peak\n* Mount Barnard\n* Black Kaweah\n* Florence Peak\n* Junction Peak\n* Kaweah Peaks Ridge\n* Kaweah Queen\n* Mount Kaweah\n* Mount Langley\n* Mount Le Conte\n* Mount Mallory\n* Mount McAdie\n* Milestone Mountain\n* Mount Muir\n* Red Kaweah\n* Mount Russell\n* Sawtooth Peak\n* Mount Stewart\n* Table Mountain\n* Triple Divide Peak\n* Mount Tyndall\n* Thunder Mountain\n* Mount Whitney\n |\n| Historic places | * Ash Mountain Entrance Sign\n* Cabin Creek Ranger Residence\n* Cattle Cabin\n* Giant Forest Lodge Historic District\n* Giant Forest Village\u2013Camp Kaweah Historic District\n* Hockett Meadow Ranger Station\n* Hospital Rock\n* Pear Lake Ski Hut\n* Quinn Ranger Station\n* Redwood Meadow Ranger Station\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Official website ![Edit this at Wikidata](image) of the National Park Service\n* Geologic Map of Southwestern Sequoia National Park \u2013 United States Geological Survey\n* Virtual reality scenes in Sequoia National Park\n* Lary M.

Sonoma is one of the principal cities of California's Wine Country and the center of the Sonoma Valley AVA. Sonoma's population was 10,739 as of the 2020 census,[1] while the Sonoma urban area had a population of 32,679.[12] Sonoma is a popular tourist destination, owing to its Californian wineries, noted events like the Sonoma International Film Festival, and its historic center.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Sonoma Plaza from the south\nThe city is situated in the Sonoma Valley, with the Mayacamas Mountains to the east and the Sonoma Mountains to the west, with the prominent landform Sears Point to the southwest. Sonoma has an area of 2.7\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (7.0\u00a0km2).\n\n\nThe principal watercourse in the town is Sonoma Creek, which flows in a southerly direction to discharge ultimately to the Napa Sonoma Marsh; Arroyo Seco Creek is a tributary to Schell Creek with a confluence in the eastern portion of the town.\nThe active Rodgers Fault lies to the west of Sonoma Creek; however, the risk of major damage is mitigated by the fact that most of the soils beneath the city consist of a slight alluvial terrace underlain by strongly cemented sedimentary and volcanic rock.[40] To the immediate south, west and east are deeper rich, alluvial soils that support valuable agricultural cultivation. The mountain block to the north rises to 1,200 feet (366 m) and provides an important scenic backdrop.\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\"U.S. Climate Normals Quick Access \u2013 Station: Sonoma, CA\".

The population density was 3,883.3 inhabitants per square mile (1,499.4/km2). The racial makeup of Sonoma was 9,242 (86.8%) White, 52 (0.5%) African American, 56 (0.5%) Native American, 300 (2.8%) Asian, 23 (0.2%) Pacific Islander, 711 (6.7%) from other races, and 264 (2.5%) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1,634 persons (15.3%).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSonoma's origins date to 1823, when Jos\u00e9 Altimira established Mission San Francisco Solano, under the direction of Governor Luis Antonio Arg\u00fcello. Following the Mexican secularization of the missions, famed Californio statesman Mariano G. Vallejo founded Sonoma on the former mission's lands in 1835. Sonoma served as the base of General Vallejo's operations until the Bear Flag Revolt in 1846, when American filibusters overthrew the local Mexican government and declared the California Republic, ushering in the American Conquest of California.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nWhen the first Europeans arrived, the area was near the northeast corner of the Coast Miwok territory,[13] with Southern Pomo to the northwest, Wappo to the northeast, Suisunes and Patwin peoples to the east.[14][15]\n\n\n\n### Mission era[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Mission San Francisco Solano\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Sonoma Valley High School, 1910\nWhen the U.S. military occupation of California ended in 1850, when California was admitted as a state, Sonoma was named the county seat for Sonoma County. About that time the flow of miners had slowed and the U.S. Army was leaving Sonoma. Business in Sonoma moved into a recession in 1851.[37] Surrounding towns such as Petaluma and Santa Rosa were developing and gaining population faster than Sonoma. An 1854 special election moved the county seat and its entailed economic activity to Santa Rosa.\n\n\n\n### Contemporary era[edit]\n\n\nThe United States Navy operated a rest center at the Mission Inn through World War II.[38]\n\n\nParts of Wes Craven's *Scream* (1996) were filmed in the city, with shots of the Sonoma Community Center masked as Westboro High School.[39]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSonoma has a typical lowland near-coastal Californian warm-summer mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification *Csb*) with hot, dry summers (although nights are comfortably cool) and cool, wet winters. In January, the normal high is 57.2\u00a0\u00b0F (14.0\u00a0\u00b0C) and the typical low is 37.2\u00a0\u00b0F (2.9\u00a0\u00b0C). In July, the normal high is 88.6\u00a0\u00b0F (31.4\u00a0\u00b0C) and the normal low is 51.2\u00a0\u00b0F (10.7\u00a0\u00b0C). There are an average of 58.1 days with highs of 90\u00a0\u00b0F (32\u00a0\u00b0C) or higher and 12.1 days with highs of 100\u00a0\u00b0F (38\u00a0\u00b0C). The highest temperature on record was 116\u00a0\u00b0F (47\u00a0\u00b0C) on July 13, 1972, and the lowest temperature was 13\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221211\u00a0\u00b0C) on December 22, 1990. Normal annual precipitation is 29.43 inches (748\u00a0mm). The wettest month on record was 20.29 inches (515\u00a0mm) in January 1995. The greatest 24-hour rainfall was 6.75 inches (171\u00a0mm) on January 4, 1982. There are an average of 68.6 days with measurable precipitation. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCalifornia State Route 12 is the main route in Sonoma, passing through the populated areas of the Sonoma Valley and connecting it to Santa Rosa to the north and Napa to the east. State routes 121 and 116 run to the south of town, passing through the unincorporated area of Schellville and connecting Sonoma Valley to Napa, Petaluma to the west, and Marin County to the south. Sonoma County Transit provides bus service from Sonoma to other points in the county. VINE Transit also operates a route between Napa and Sonoma.\n\n\nThe nearest airport with regularly scheduled commercial passenger service is Charles M. Schulz\u2013Sonoma County Airport, about 30 miles (50\u00a0km) northwest of Sonoma. San Francisco International Airport and Oakland International Airport are both about 60 miles (100\u00a0km) south of Sonoma.\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** *Population.* In: *QuickFacts: Sonoma city, California.* Census, April 1, 2020.
