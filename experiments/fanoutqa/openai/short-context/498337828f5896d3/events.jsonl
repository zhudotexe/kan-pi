It received positive reviews initially, but reception became more mixed as the seasons went on.[2][3][4] The show was nominated for 91 awards and received 21. In 2010, Alyson Hannigan won the People's Choice Award for Favorite TV Comedy Actress. In 2012, seven years after its premiere, the series won the People's Choice Award for Favorite Network TV Comedy, and Neil Patrick Harris won the award for Favorite TV Comedy Actor twice.\n\n\n\n\n## Premise[edit]\n\n\nThe series follows the adventures of Ted Mosby (played by Josh Radnor) and his love life as a single man. His stories are narrated by Bob Saget as Ted Mosby 25 years later as he tells them to his children.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n*How I Met Your Mother* was inspired by Carter Bays and Craig Thomas' idea to \"write about our friends and the stupid stuff we did in New York\", where they previously worked as writers for *Late Show with David Letterman*, among others.[1] The two drew from their friendship in creating the characters. Ted is based loosely on Bays, and Marshall and Lily are based loosely on Thomas and his wife.[5][6] Thomas' wife Rebecca was initially reluctant to have a character based on her but agreed if they could get Alyson Hannigan to play her. Hannigan was looking to do more comedy work and was available.[5] Josh Radnor and Jason Segel, who were cast as Ted and Marshall, respectively, were not well known, although Segel had been a cast member on the short-lived *Freaks and Geeks* and a recurring guest star on Judd Apatow's follow-up show, *Undeclared*. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| *How I Met Your Mother* |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)The cast pictured in the opening sequence\n |\n| Genre | * Sitcom\n* Romantic comedy\n* Comedy drama\n |\n| Created by | * Carter Bays\n* Craig Thomas\n |\n| Starring | * Josh Radnor\n* Jason Segel\n* Cobie Smulders\n* Neil Patrick Harris\n* Alyson Hannigan\n* Cristin Milioti\n |\n| Narrated by | Bob Saget |\n| Opening theme | \"Hey, Beautiful\" by The Solids |\n| Composer | John Swihart |\n| Country of origin | United States |\n| Original language | English |\n| No. of seasons | 9 |\n| No. of episodes | 208 (list of episodes) |\n| Production |\n| Executive producers | * Carter Bays\n* Craig Thomas\n* Rob Greenberg\n* Pamela Fryman\n* Eileen Heisler\n* DeAnn Heline\n* Phil Lord\n* Greg Malins\n* Christopher Miller\n* Chris Harris\n* Stephen Lloyd\n* Kourtney Kang\n* Jamie Rhonheimer\n* Chuck Tatham\n |\n| Producers | * Randy Cordray\n* Suzy Mamann Greenberg\n* Chris Harris\n* Jamie Rhonheimer\n* Kourtney Kang\n* Brenda Hsueh\n* Theresa Mulligan Rosenthal\n* Stewart Halpern-Fingerhut\n* Rob Greenberg\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n11. **^** Saget, Bob (April 4, 2014). \"How do you feel about the fact that Josh Radnor was still the older version of Ted on the series finale of HIMYM and not you?\". *Reddit*.

The series, which aired from September 19, 2005 to March 31, 2014, follows the main character, Ted Mosby, and his group of friends in New York City's Manhattan. As a framing device, Ted, in 2030, recounts to his son, Luke, and daughter, Penny, the events from September 2005 to May 2013 that led him to meet their mother. *How I Met Your Mother* was a joint production by Bays & Thomas Productions and 20th Century Fox Television, and syndicated by 20th Television (now Disney-ABC Domestic Television).\n\n\nThe series was loosely inspired by Thomas and Bays' friendship when they both lived in New York.[1] The vast majority of the episodes (196 out of 208) were directed by Pamela Fryman. The other directors were Rob Greenberg (7 episodes), Michael Shea (4 episodes), and Neil Patrick Harris (1 episode).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn January 2013, *How I Met Your Mother* was renewed for a ninth season.[44] Carter Bays told *Entertainment Weekly* that season 9 would \"feature some of the most non-linear episodes we've ever done\".[45]\n\n\nThe season 9 premiere episode aired on September 23, 2013, and the one-hour series finale aired on March 31, 2014.[46]\n\n\n\n## Cast and characters[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of *How I Met Your Mother* characters\n\n* Main cast\n* ![Josh Radnor Ted Mosby](image)\n\nJosh Radnor   \nTed Mosby\n* ![Jason Segel](image)\n\nJason Segel  \nMarshall Eriksen\n* ![Cobie Smulders](image)\n\nCobie Smulders  \nRobin Scherbatsky\n* ![Neil Patrick Harris](image)\n\nNeil Patrick Harris  \nBarney Stinson\n* ![Alyson Hannigan](image)\n\nAlyson Hannigan  \nLily Aldrin\n* ![Cristin Milioti](image)\n\nCristin Milioti  \nThe Mother\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA scene relating to the identity of the mother, involving Ted's future children, was filmed in 2006 for the show's eventual series finale.[23] This was done because the teenage actors portraying them would be adults by the time the final season was shot.[21]\n\n\nDuring the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, *How I Met Your Mother* shut down production; when the strike ended, the show returned on March 17, 2008, with nine new episodes.[24] The network announced a change in the timeslot to 8:30 pm ET/7:30 pm CT, flip-flopping from the summer schedule with *The Big Bang Theory*.[25] CBS renewed the show for a fourth season on May 14, 2008,[26] which premiered on September 22, 2008.[27]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n## External links[edit]\n\n\n**How I Met Your Mother** at Wikipedia's sister projects\n\n* ![](image)Media from Commons\n* ![](image)Quotations from Wikiquote\n* ![](image)Data from Wikidata\n\n* How I Met Your Mother at Curlie\n* *How I Met Your Mother* at IMDb ![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\n* *How I Met Your Dad* at IMDb ![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n*How I Met Your Mother*\n |\n| --- |\n| Episodes | * Season 1\n* 2\n* 3\n* 4\n* 5\n* 6\n* 7\n* 8\n* 9\n |\n| Characters | * Ted Mosby\n* Marshall Eriksen\n* Lily Aldrin\n* Barney Stinson\n* Robin Scherbatsky\n* Tracy McConnell\n |\n| Soundtracks | * \"Let's Go to the Mall\"\n* \"Sandcastles in the Sand\"\n* \"Nothing Suits Me Like a Suit\"\n* \"P.S.

Several well-known college sports facilities exist in the city, including Michigan Stadium, the largest American football stadium in the world and the third-largest stadium of any kind in the world.[117] Michigan Stadium has a capacity of 107,601, with the final \"extra\" seat said to be reserved for and in honor of former athletic director and Hall of Fame football coach Fitz Crisler.[118] The stadium was completed in 1927 and cost more than $950,000 to build. The stadium is colloquially known as \"The Big House\" due to its status as the largest American football stadium.[119] Crisler Center and Yost Ice Arena play host to the school's basketball (both men's and women's) and ice hockey teams, respectively.[120] Concordia University, a member of the NAIA, also fields sports teams.[121]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| University of Michigan Central Campus Historic District\n |\n| U.S. National Register of Historic Places\n |\n| U.S. Historic district\n |\n|  |\n| ![](image) |\n| Location | University of Michigan campus, Ann Arbor, Michigan |\n| Area | 85 acres (34 ha) |\n| Built | 1840 (1840) |\n| Architectural style | Late 19th and 20th Century RevivalsLate VictorianArt Deco |\n| NRHP reference No. | 78001514[40] |\n| Added to NRHP | June 15, 1978 |\n\n\nAnn Arbor is located along the Huron River, which flows southeast through the city on its way to Lake Erie. It is the central core of the Ann Arbor, MI Metropolitan Statistical Area, which consists of the whole of Washtenaw County, but is also a part of the Metro Detroit Combined Statistical Area designated by the U.S. Census Bureau.[41] While it borders only Townships, the built-up nature of the sections of Pittsfield and Ypsilanti townships between Ann Arbor and the city of Ypsilanti make the two effectively a single urban area.[42][43]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Ann Arbor** is a city in the U.S. state of Michigan and the seat of government of Washtenaw County.[7] The 2020 census recorded its population to be 123,851, making it the fifth-largest city in Michigan.[8] It is the principal city of the Ann Arbor Metropolitan Statistical Area, which encompasses all of Washtenaw County. Ann Arbor is also included in the Greater Detroit Combined Statistical Area and the Great Lakes megalopolis, the most populated and largest megalopolis in North America.\n\n\nAnn Arbor is home to the University of Michigan. The university significantly shapes Ann Arbor's economy as it employs about 30,000 workers, including about 12,000 in its medical center. The city's economy is also centered on high technology, with several companies drawn to the area by the university's research and development infrastructure.[9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAnn Arbor is nicknamed \"Tree Town,\" both due to its name and to the dense forestation of its parks and residential areas. The city contains more than 50,000 trees along its streets and an equal number in parks.[46] In recent years, the emerald ash borer has destroyed many of the city's approximately 10,500 ash trees.[47] The city contains 157 municipal parks ranging from small neighborhood green spots to large recreation areas. Several large city parks and a university park border sections of the Huron River.[48] Fuller Recreation Area, near the University Hospital complex, contains sports fields, pedestrian and bike paths, and swimming pools. The Nichols Arboretum, owned by the University of Michigan, is a 123-acre (50 ha) arboretum that contains hundreds of plant and tree species. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Barton Dam\n![](image)Argo Dam\nThe University of Michigan Medical Center, the only teaching hospital in the city, took the number 1 slot in *U.S. News & World Report* for best hospital in the state of Michigan, as of 2015.[164] The University of Michigan Health System (UMHS) includes University Hospital, C.S. Mott Children's Hospital and Women's Hospital in its core complex. UMHS also operates out-patient clinics and facilities throughout the city. The area's other major medical centers include a large facility operated by the Department of Veterans Affairs in Ann Arbor,[165] and Saint Joseph Mercy Hospital in nearby Superior Township.[166]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Christopher Taylor\n* Cynthia Harrison\n* Linh Song\n* Christopher Watson\n* Travis Radina\n* Ayesha Ghazi Edwin\n* Jen Eyer\n* Dharma Akmon\n* Jenn Cornell\n* Erica Briggs\n* Lisa Disch\n |\n| Area[2]\n |\n|  • City | 29.09 sq mi (75.35 km2) |\n|  • Land | 28.22 sq mi (73.10 km2) |\n|  • Water | 0.87 sq mi (2.25 km2) |\n|  • Urban | 159.57 sq mi (413.46 km2) |\n|  • Metro | 722 sq mi (1,870 km2) |\n| Elevation | 840 ft (256 m) |\n| Population(2020)\n |\n|  • City | 123,851 |\n|  • Estimate (2021)[4]\n | 121,536 |\n|  • Rank | 231st in the United States5th in Michigan |\n|  • Density | 4,388.14/sq mi (1,694.28/km2) |\n|  • Urban | 317,689 (US: 129th)[3] |\n|  • Urban density | 2,214.6/sq mi (855.0/km2) |\n|  • Metro[5]\n | 372,258 (US: 148th) |\n| Demonym | Ann Arborite |\n| Time zone | UTC−5 (Eastern (EST)) |\n|  • Summer (DST) | UTC−4 (EDT) |\n| ZIP code(s) | 48103–48109, 48113\n |\n| Area code | 734 |\n| FIPS code | 26-03000[6] |\n| GNIS feature ID | 0620133[6] |\n| Website | www.a2gov.org |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAnn Arbor is home to several private schools,[145] including Emerson School, the Father Gabriel Richard High School, Rudolf Steiner School of Ann Arbor (a Prek-12 Waldorf school), Clonlara School, Michigan Islamic Academy, and Greenhills School, a prep school.

The university significantly shapes Ann Arbor's economy as it employs about 30,000 workers, including about 12,000 in its medical center. The city's economy is also centered on high technology, with several companies drawn to the area by the university's research and development infrastructure.[9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Christopher Taylor\n* Cynthia Harrison\n* Linh Song\n* Christopher Watson\n* Travis Radina\n* Ayesha Ghazi Edwin\n* Jen Eyer\n* Dharma Akmon\n* Jenn Cornell\n* Erica Briggs\n* Lisa Disch\n |\n| Area[2]\n |\n|  • City | 29.09 sq mi (75.35 km2) |\n|  • Land | 28.22 sq mi (73.10 km2) |\n|  • Water | 0.87 sq mi (2.25 km2) |\n|  • Urban | 159.57 sq mi (413.46 km2) |\n|  • Metro | 722 sq mi (1,870 km2) |\n| Elevation | 840 ft (256 m) |\n| Population(2020)\n |\n|  • City | 123,851 |\n|  • Estimate (2021)[4]\n | 121,536 |\n|  • Rank | 231st in the United States5th in Michigan |\n|  • Density | 4,388.14/sq mi (1,694.28/km2) |\n|  • Urban | 317,689 (US: 129th)[3] |\n|  • Urban density | 2,214.6/sq mi (855.0/km2) |\n|  • Metro[5]\n | 372,258 (US: 148th) |\n| Demonym | Ann Arborite |\n| Time zone | UTC−5 (Eastern (EST)) |\n|  • Summer (DST) | UTC−4 (EDT) |\n| ZIP code(s) | 48103–48109, 48113\n |\n| Area code | 734 |\n| FIPS code | 26-03000[6] |\n| GNIS feature ID | 0620133[6] |\n| Website | www.a2gov.org |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| University of Michigan Central Campus Historic District\n |\n| U.S. National Register of Historic Places\n |\n| U.S. Historic district\n |\n|  |\n| ![](image) |\n| Location | University of Michigan campus, Ann Arbor, Michigan |\n| Area | 85 acres (34 ha) |\n| Built | 1840 (1840) |\n| Architectural style | Late 19th and 20th Century RevivalsLate VictorianArt Deco |\n| NRHP reference No. | 78001514[40] |\n| Added to NRHP | June 15, 1978 |\n\n\nAnn Arbor is located along the Huron River, which flows southeast through the city on its way to Lake Erie. It is the central core of the Ann Arbor, MI Metropolitan Statistical Area, which consists of the whole of Washtenaw County, but is also a part of the Metro Detroit Combined Statistical Area designated by the U.S. Census Bureau.[41] While it borders only Townships, the built-up nature of the sections of Pittsfield and Ypsilanti townships between Ann Arbor and the city of Ypsilanti make the two effectively a single urban area.[42][43]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nCity in Michigan, United States\n\n\"Ann Arbor\" redirects here.

On May 25, 1825, the town plat was registered with Wayne County as the Village of Ann arbor, the earliest known use of the town's name.[14][15] Allen and Rumsey decided to name it for their wives, both named Ann, and for the stands of bur oak in the 640 acres (260 ha) of land they purchased for $800 from the federal government at $1.25 per acre.[10] The local Ojibwa named the settlement *kaw-goosh-kaw-nick*, after the sound of Allen's sawmill.[16]\n\n\nAnn Arbor became the seat of Washtenaw County in 1827[17] and was incorporated as a village in 1833.[18] The Ann Arbor Land Company, a group of speculators, set aside 40 acres (16 ha) of undeveloped land and offered it to the state of Michigan as the site of the state capitol, but lost the bid to Lansing. In 1837, the property was accepted instead as the site of the University of Michigan.[19]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n169. **^** \"About Us\". Recycle Ann Arbor. 2007.

Ann Arbor is the home to Internet2 and the Merit Network, a not-for-profit research and education computer network. Both are located in the South State Commons 2 building on South State Street, which once housed the Michigan Information Technology Center Foundation.[90] The city is also home to a secondary office of Google's AdWords program—the company's primary revenue stream.[91] The recent surge in companies operating in Ann Arbor has led to a decrease in its office and flex space vacancy rates. As of December 31, 2012, the total market vacancy rate for office and flex space is 11.80%, a 1.40% decrease in vacancy from one year previous, and the lowest overall vacancy level since 2003. The office vacancy rate decreased to 10.65% in 2012 from 12.08% in 2011, while the flex vacancy rate decreased slightly more, with a drop from 16.50% to 15.02%.[92]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The Ann Arbor Unitarian Universalist Church was designed by Donaldson & Meier and built in 1881-2 by the Walker Brothers.

Major roads branch out from the downtown district like spokes on a wheel to the highways surrounding the city. The city is belted by three freeways: I-94, which runs along the southern and western portion of the city; U.S. Highway 23 (US 23), which primarily runs along the eastern edge of Ann Arbor; and M-14, which runs along the northern edge of the city. Other nearby highways include US 12 (Michigan Ave.), M-17 (Washtenaw Ave.), and M-153 (Ford Rd.). Several of the major surface arteries lead to the I-94/M-14 interchange in the west, US 23 in the east, and the city's southern areas.[203]\n\n\n\n## Sister cities[edit]\n\n\nAnn Arbor has seven sister cities:[204][205]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA person from Ann Arbor is called an \"Ann Arborite\", and many long-time residents call themselves \"townies\". The city itself is often called \"A²\" (\"A-squared\") or \"A2\" (\"A two\") or \"AA\", \"The Deuce\" (mainly by Chicagoans), and \"Tree Town\".[122] With tongue-in-cheek reference to the city's liberal political leanings, some occasionally refer to Ann Arbor as \"The People's Republic of Ann Arbor\"[123] or \"25 square miles surrounded by reality\",[124] the latter phrase being adapted from Wisconsin Governor Lee Dreyfus's description of Madison, Wisconsin. In *A Prairie Home Companion* broadcast from Ann Arbor, Garrison Keillor described Ann Arbor as \"a city where people discuss socialism, but only in the fanciest restaurants.\" Ann Arbor sometimes appears on citation indexes as an author, instead of a location, often with the academic degree *MI*, a misunderstanding of the abbreviation for Michigan.[125]\n\n\n\n## Government and politics[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of mayors of Ann Arbor, Michigan\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAccording to the 2012–2016 American Community Survey estimates, the median household income was $57,697, and the median family income was $95,528.[78] Males over age 25 and with earnings had a median income of $51,682, versus $39,203 for females.[79] The per capita income for the city was $37,158.[74] Nearly a quarter (23.4%) of people and 6.7% of families had incomes below the poverty level.[80]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nThe University of Michigan shapes Ann Arbor's economy significantly. It employs about 30,000 workers, including about 12,000 in the medical center.[81] Other employers are drawn to the area by the university's research and development money, and by its graduates. High tech, health services and biotechnology are other major components of the city's economy; numerous medical offices, laboratories, and associated companies are located in the city. Automobile manufacturers, such as General Motors and Visteon, also employ residents.[81]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_GFNquCoZTgAMT175b8oNkS1r","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
