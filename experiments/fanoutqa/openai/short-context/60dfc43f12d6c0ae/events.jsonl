It was released on 6 January 2017 as one of the double lead singles from his third studio album *÷* (2017), along with \"Castle on the Hill\". The dancehall and R&B-infused pop song was written by Sheeran, Steve Mac and Johnny McDaid. Due to its interpolation of \"No Scrubs\" by TLC, Kandi Burruss, Tameka \"Tiny\" Cottle, and Kevin \"She'kspere\" Briggs are also credited as writers. The song was produced by Sheeran and Mac.\n\n\n\"Shape of You\" peaked at number one on the singles charts of 34 countries, including the US *Billboard* Hot 100 (later becoming the best performing song of 2017), as well as the UK, Australian and Canadian singles charts. It stayed at number one for a record-tying 16 consecutive weeks on the Canadian Hot 100, as well as 14 nonconsecutive weeks on the UK Singles Chart, and 12 non-consecutive weeks on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n105. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Shape of You (Acoustic): Ed Sheeran\". *Amazon UK*.

After signing to independent record label Rostrum Records at a young age, Khalifa released his first mixtape *Prince of the City: Welcome to Pistolvania*, and his first studio album, *Show and Prove* (2006).[1] Following the release of *Show and Prove*, Warner Bros. Records signed Khalifa in 2007 as part of a joint deal with Rostrum. At Warner, Khalifa released the singles \"Youngin' on His Grind\" and \"Say Yeah\". The latter became his first song to appear on a *Billboard* chart, peaking at number 20 on the US Hot Rap Songs.[1] Disagreements with Warner over the release of a purported major-label debut album led Khalifa to departed from the label, and release his second studio album *Deal or No Deal* in 2009 on Rostrum Records alone.[1]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n43. **^** \"Wiz Khalifa Laugh Now, Fly Later mixtape\". *Billboard*.
