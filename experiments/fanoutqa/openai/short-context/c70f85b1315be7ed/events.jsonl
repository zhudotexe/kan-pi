The affiliations are those at the time of the Nobel Prize announcement.[1] Universities all adopt different metrics to claim Nobel affiliates, some generous while others more stringent, since some only count academicians at the time of announcement while others include all visitors and professors of various ranks as well.

In 1718, Elihu Yale sold a portion of his collection of gems and furniture to provide an initial fund of Â£562 for the establishment of the school's endowment.[5] From 1985 until 2021, the Chief Investment Officer of Yale was alumnus David Swensen, who was replaced by alumnus Matthew Mendelsohn.[2][3] As of 2013, the chairman of the Yale Investment Committee, which provides oversight of the endowment, was Douglas A.
