This magnitude 8.1 earthquake in the outer elevation of the Kermadec-Tonga subduction zone was the largest earthquake of 2009.\nThe subsequent tsunami caused substantial damage and loss of life in Samoa, American Samoa, and Tonga. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center recorded a 76 mm (3.0 in) rise in sea level near the epicenter, and New Zealand scientists noted waves up to 14 m (46 ft) off the coast of Samoa. More than 189 people, especially children, were killed, most of them in Samoa. Large waves without major damage were reported in Fiji, the north coast of New Zealand and Rarotonga in the Cook Islands. People from the low-lying atolls of Tokelau moved to higher ground as a precautionary measure.\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n43. **^** Maugh II, Thomas H.

The earthquake was the second largest earthquake in recorded history. The initial surge was measured at a height of approximately 33 meters (108 ft), making it one of the largest earthquake-generated tsunamis in recorded history. The tsunami killed people from the immediate vicinity of the earthquake in Indonesia, Thailand, and the northwest coast of Malaysia, to thousands of miles away in Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka, the Maldives, and as far afield as Somalia, Kenya, and Tanzania. This tsunami that crossed the Indian Ocean is an example of a teletsunami, which travels great distances across the open ocean, and an ocean-wide tsunami. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n62. **^** Yanagisawa, H.; Goto, K.; Sugawara, D.; Kanamaru, K.; Iwamoto, N.; Takamori, Y.

The wave caused widespread devastation, with an official count of 18,550 people confirmed dead or missing.[123] The highest recorded tsunami in Miyako, Iwate reached a total height of 40.5 metres (133 ft).[124] Additionally, the tsunami precipitated multiple hydrogen and hydrogen/oxygen explosions at the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant. Tsunami warnings were issued for the entire Pacific Rim.[125][126]\n |\n| 2012\n | El Salvador and Nicaragua\n | 2012 El Salvador earthquake | Earthquake\n | On 26 August 2012, a magnitude 7.3 earthquake triggered local tsunami waves of up to six metres (20 ft) along a small stretch of the coast of El Salvador, injuring at least 40 people. Smaller waves were recorded in Nicaragua and the Galápagos Islands.[127] |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 684 CE | Nankai, Japan | 684 Hakuhō earthquake, Nankai earthquake | Earthquake | The first recorded tsunami in Japan struck on 29 November 684 AD off the coast of the Kii, Shikoku, and Awaji region. The earthquake, estimated at a magnitude of 8.4,[28] was followed by a large tsunami, but there are no estimates of the number of deaths.[44] From then on, the Japanese would keep meticulous records of tsunamis.[45][*citation needed*] |\n| 869 CE | Sanriku, Japan | 869 Jōgan earthquake | Earthquake | The Sanriku region was hit by a large tsunami on 9 July 869 AD, causing floods to spread 4 km (2.5 mi) inland from the coast. Tagajō was destroyed, with an estimated 1,000 casualties.\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n115. **^** \"Tsunamis and Earthquakes – 1998 Papua New Guinea tsunami Descriptive Model – USGS WCMG\".
