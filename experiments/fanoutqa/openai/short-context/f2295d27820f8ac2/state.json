These figures show that between 1905 and 1935, the Siberian Husky was consistently in either first or second place. Malteses were the most popular dog from 1936 all the way through to 1952, when the Beagle became the number one dog until 1959. Poodles would become the most popular breed for the longest, reigning from 1960 for the next twenty-two years until 1982, when the American Maltese once again took over until 1990. The Labrador Retriever has been the most popular since 1991.[1]\n\n\n\n## Club registration figures for 2006[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** American Kennel Club - Most Popular Pooches\n2. **^** \"2005 and 2006 registration figures for all recognised breeds\".

These figures show that between 1905 and 1935, the Siberian Husky was consistently in either first or second place. Malteses were the most popular dog from 1936 all the way through to 1952, when the Beagle became the number one dog until 1959. Poodles would become the most popular breed for the longest, reigning from 1960 for the next twenty-two years until 1982, when the American Maltese once again took over until 1990. The Labrador Retriever has been the most popular since 1991.[1]\n\n\n\n## Club registration figures for 2006[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** American Kennel Club - Most Popular Pooches\n2. **^** \"2005 and 2006 registration figures for all recognised breeds\".

By 1926 this number had grown to over 8000.[5] The breed gained international recognition after the end of World War I. Returning soldiers spoke highly of the breed and animal actors Rin Tin Tin and Strongheart popularised the breed further.[67] The first German Shepherd Dog registered in the United States was Queen of Switzerland. Her offspring had defects as the result of poor breeding, which caused the breed to decline in popularity during the late 1920s.[67]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n25. **^** \"Change of Name\u00a0\u2013 German Shepherd Dog\". *The Kennel Club*. 19 October 2010.

It was recognised that the breed had the necessary skills for herding sheep, such as intelligence, speed, strength and keen senses of smell.[6] The results were dogs that were able to do such things, but that differed significantly, both in appearance and ability, from one locality to another.[5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** Deutscher Sch\u00e4ferhund (Langstockhaar) (in German).

The founders of the club collected all available information about the breed and its best representatives and developed a new standard for the English Bulldog, which was published on 27 May 1875, the same year they held the first breed show. Since 1878, exhibitions of the club were held annually, except during the Second World War. On 17 May 1894, the Bulldog Club was granted the status of a corporation and since then has carried the official name \"The Bulldog Club, Inc.\". It is the oldest mono-breed dog kennel club in the world.[15]\n\n\nThe Bulldog was officially recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1886.[16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n16. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** \"Get to Know the Bulldog\" Archived 22 December 2015 at the Wayback Machine, 'The American Kennel Club'.

The Bulldog Club (In England) was formed in 1878, and the Bulldog Club of America was formed in 1890. While often used as a symbol of ferocity and courage, modern Bulldogs are generally friendly, amiable dogs. Bulldogs are now commonly kept as pets; in 2013 it was in twelfth place on a list of the breeds most frequently registered worldwide.[4]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Painting of a Bulldog from 1790 by English artist Philip Reinagle.The first reference to the word \"Bulldog\" is dated 1631 or 1632 in a letter by a man named Preswick Eaton where he writes: \"procuer mee two good Bulldogs, and let them be sent by ye first shipp\".[5] In 1666, English scientist Christopher Merret applied: \"Canis pugnax, *a Butchers Bull or Bear Dog*\", as an entry in his *Pinax Rerum Naturalium Britannicarum*.[6]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Herding dogs | * Bearded Collie\n* Border Collie\n* Cardigan Welsh Corgi\n* Lancashire Heeler\n* Old English Sheepdog\n* Pembroke Welsh Corgi\n* Rough Collie\n* Shetland Sheepdog\n* Smithfield\n* Smooth Collie\n* Welsh Sheepdog\n |\n| Other | * Bulldog\n* Bullmastiff\n* Cavalier King Charles Spaniel\n* English Mastiff\n* King Charles Spaniel\n* Northern Inuit Dog\n |\n| Extinct | * Black and Tan Terrier\n* Blue Paul Terrier\n* Buckhound\n* Cumberland Sheepdog\n* Cur\n* Dumfriesshire Black and Tan Foxhound\n* English Water Spaniel\n* English White Terrier\n* Norfolk Spaniel\n* North Country Beagle\n* Old English Bulldog\n* Old Welsh Grey Sheepdog\n* Paisley Terrier\n* Southern Hound\n* Sleuth hound\n* Staghound\n* Talbot Hound\n* Toy Bulldog\n* Toy Trawler Spaniel\n* Turnspit dog\n* Tweed Water Spaniel\n* Welsh Hillman\n |\n| **Types:** Collies, Fell Terriers, Fox Terriers, Longdogs & Lurchers\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)A 4-year-old Bulldog of Champion bloodlines, side view. Note the \"rope\" over the nose, and pronounced underbite\nBulldogs have characteristically wide heads and shoulders along with a pronounced mandibular prognathism. There are generally thick folds of skin on the brow; round, black, wide-set eyes; a short muzzle with characteristic folds called a rope or nose roll above the nose; hanging skin under the neck; drooping lips and pointed teeth, and an underbite with an upturned jaw. The coat is short, flat, and sleek with colours of red, fawn, white, brindle, and piebald.[16] They have short tails that can either hang down straight or be tucked in a coiled \"corkscrew\" into a tail pocket. \n\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the breed standards are 55\u00a0lb (25\u00a0kg) for a male and 50\u00a0lb (23\u00a0kg) for a female.[19] In the United States, the standard calls for a smaller dog \u2014 a typical mature male weighs 50\u00a0lb (23\u00a0kg), while mature females weigh about 40\u00a0lb (18\u00a0kg).[20]\n\n\n\n### Temperament[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBritish breed of dog\n\nThis article is about the English Bulldog.

Americans had been importing French Bulldogs for a while, but it was not until 1885 when they were brought over in order to set up an American-based breeding program. They were mostly owned by society ladies, who first displayed them at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in 1896.[9] They arrived again in the following year with even more entries, where the judging of the breed would go on to have future ramifications. The judge in question at the dog show, George Raper, only chose winners with \"rose ears\"\u2014ears that folded at the tip, as with the standard for Bulldogs.[10] The ladies formed the French Bull Dog Club of America and created the breed standard which stated for the first time that the \"erect bat ear\" was the correct type.[5]:\u200a7\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nCousens, a meeting was held to set up a breed club in order to seek individual recognition for the French breed.[5]:\u200a7 The adopted breed standard was the same one which was already in use in America, France, Germany and Austria.[6]:\u200a58 Despite opposition from Miniature Bulldog (the new breed name for the Toy Bulldog) and Bulldog breeders,[6]:\u200a59 in 1905, the Kennel Club changed its policy on the breed and recognized them separate from the English variety, initially as the Bouledogue Francais, then later in 1912 with the name changed to the French Bulldog.[5]:\u200a7\n\n\nIt is commonly kept as a pet: in 2020 it was the second-most registered dog in the United Kingdom,[13] and the fourth-most in the United States.[12] They were rated the third-most popular dog in Australia in 2017.[14] In 2019, in the United Kingdom, the French Bulldog had 375 export pedigrees[15] and a total of 33,661 registered dogs.[16] By comparison, the Labrador Retriever had over 36,700 dogs and the Cocker Spaniel fewer than 22,000.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n32. **^** Evans, Katy M.; Adams, Vicki J.

These figures show that between 1905 and 1935, the Siberian Husky was consistently in either first or second place. Malteses were the most popular dog from 1936 all the way through to 1952, when the Beagle became the number one dog until 1959. Poodles would become the most popular breed for the longest, reigning from 1960 for the next twenty-two years until 1982, when the American Maltese once again took over until 1990. The Labrador Retriever has been the most popular since 1991.[1]\n\n\n\n## Club registration figures for 2006[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Position\n | Breed\n | Registrations\n |\n| --- |
