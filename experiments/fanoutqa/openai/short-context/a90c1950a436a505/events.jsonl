The city is bordered on its northern, western, and southern sides by the state of Haryana and to the east by that of Uttar Pradesh (UP). Two prominent features of the geography of Delhi are the Yamuna flood plains and the Delhi ridge. The Yamuna River was the historical boundary between Punjab and UP, and its flood plains provide fertile alluvial soil suitable for agriculture but are prone to recurrent floods. The Yamuna, a sacred river in Hinduism, is the only major river flowing through Delhi. The Hindon River separates Ghaziabad from the eastern part of Delhi. The Delhi ridge originates from the Aravalli Range in the south and encircles the west, northeast, and northwest parts of the city. It reaches a height of 318 m (1,043 ft) and is a dominant feature of the region.[74]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n88. **^** \"new delhi (safdarjung) extreme weather events in the month of april\" (PDF).

The network consists of 10 colour-coded lines[193] serving 255 stations[c] with a total length of 348.12 kilometres (216.31 mi).[d] The system has a mix of underground, at-grade, and elevated stations using both broad-gauge and standard-gauge. All stations have escalators, lifts, and tactile tiles to guide the visually impaired from station entrances to trains. There are 18 designated parking sites at the Metro stations.

The hottest day of the year is usually witnessed between 26 and 30 May, with an average high of 42 °C (108 °F) and low of 27 °C (81 °F).[78] The cold season lasts from 26 November to 9 February with an average daily high temperature below 20 °C (68 °F).

In winter, cold northerly winds from Siberia can cause nighttime temperatures to drop below freezing, and although not usually associated with snow, the city can receive one or two days of snowfall per year. In contrast, and in spite of being the peak tourist season, summer in Shanghai is very warm and humid, with occasional downpours or freak thunderstorms. The city is also susceptible to typhoons, none of which in recent years has caused considerable damage.[12] The most pleasant seasons are Spring, although changeable, and Autumn, which is generally sunny and dry.\n\n\n**Climate statistics of 2013:**[13]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Pudong | * Oriental Pearl Tower\n* Jin Mao Tower\n* Shanghai World Financial Center\n* Shanghai Tower\n* Bocom Financial Towers\n* Shanghai IFC\n* One Lujiazui\n* Bank of Shanghai\n |\n| Puxi | * K11\n* Shimao International Plaza\n* Plaza 66\n* White Magnolia Plaza\n* Shanghai Wheelock Square\n* Tomorrow Square\n* Grand Gateway Shanghai\n |\n\n |\n| Sportsvenues | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Football | * Shanghai\n* Hongkou\n* Pudong\n* Jinshan\n* Yuanshen\n* Zhabei\n |\n| Indoor | * Jiangwan\n* Luwan\n* Shanghai Indoor\n* Mercedes-Benz\n* Int'l Gym\n* Oriental\n |\n| Other | * Tennis\n\t+ Qizhong\n\n\n* Motorsport circuit\n\t+ International\n\t+ Street\n\t+ Tianma\n\n\n* Cycling\n\t+ Tour of Chongming Island\n\n\n* Golf\n\t+ BMW Masters\n\t+ Sheshan Golf Club\n\n\n* Horse racing\n\t+ Shanghai Race Club\n |\n\n |\n| Sportsteams | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Football | * Shenhua\n* Port\n* Jiading Huilong\n |\n| Other | * Basketball\n\t+ Sharks\n |\n\n |\n| Transport | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Airports | * Hongqiao\n* Pudong\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Shanghai now the world's largest cargo port !\".

Some parts of the city have been constructed on reclaimed tidal flats that occur around the area.[49] Thirteen rivers flow through Jakarta. They are Ciliwung River, Kalibaru, Pesanggrahan, Cipinang, Angke River, Maja, Mookervart, Krukut, Buaran, West Tarum, Cakung, Petukangan, Sunter River and Grogol River.[50][51] They flow from the Puncak highlands to the south of the city, then across the city northwards towards the Java Sea. The Ciliwung River divides the city into the western and eastern districts.\n\n\nThese rivers, combined with the wet season rains and insufficient drainage due to clogging, make Jakarta prone to flooding.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Climate data for Jakarta (Kemayoran) (1991–2020 normals)\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 36.9(98.4)\n | 34.8(94.6)\n | 36.0(96.8)\n | 35.9(96.6)\n | 36.1(97.0)\n | 36.3(97.3)\n | 35.6(96.1)\n | 35.6(96.1)\n | 37.1(98.8)\n | 37.9(100.2)\n | 37.1(98.8)\n | 36.7(98.1)\n | 37.9(100.2)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | 31.0(87.8)\n | 30.8(87.4)\n | 32.1(89.8)\n | 32.8(91.0)\n | 33.2(91.8)\n | 32.9(91.2)\n | 32.7(90.9)\n | 33.0(91.4)\n | 33.4(92.1)\n | 33.4(92.1)\n | 32.8(91.0)\n | 32.0(89.6)\n | 32.5(90.5)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | 27.5(81.5)\n | 27.3(81.1)\n | 28.0(82.4)\n | 28.4(83.1)\n | 28.7(83.7)\n | 28.4(83.1)\n | 28.2(82.8)\n | 28.3(82.9)\n | 28.6(83.5)\n | 28.8(83.8)\n | 28.4(83.1)\n | 28.0(82.4)\n | 28.2(82.8)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | 25.2(77.4)\n | 25.2(77.4)\n | 25.5(77.9)\n | 25.6(78.1)\n | 25.8(78.4)\n | 25.5(77.9)\n | 25.3(77.5)\n | 25.3(77.5)\n | 25.5(77.9)\n | 25.6(78.1)\n | 25.6(78.1)\n | 25.5(77.9)\n | 25.5(77.9)\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Aerial view of North Jakarta\nJakarta is situated on the northwest coast of Java, at the mouth of the Ciliwung River on Jakarta Bay, an inlet of the Java Sea.

While serving as \"bed towns\" for those working in central Tokyo, some of them also have a local commercial and industrial base, such as Tachikawa. Collectively, these are often known as the Tama area or Western Tokyo. The far west of the Tama area is occupied by the district (*gun*) of Nishi-Tama. Much of this area is mountainous and unsuitable for urbanization. The highest mountain in Tokyo, Mount Kumotori, is 2,017 m (6,617 ft) high; other mountains in Tokyo include Takanosu (1,737 m (5,699 ft)), Odake (1,266 m (4,154 ft)), and Mitake (929 m (3,048 ft)). Lake Okutama, on the Tama River near Yamanashi Prefecture, is Tokyo's largest lake. The district is composed of three towns (Hinode, Mizuho and Okutama) and one village (Hinohara). \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)A satellite photo of Tokyo in 2018 taken by ESA Sentinel-2\n![](image)The Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building\nThe mainland portion of Tokyo lies northwest of Tokyo Bay and measures about 90 km (56 mi) east to west and 25 km (16 mi) north to south. The average elevation in Tokyo is 40 m (131 ft).[49] Chiba Prefecture borders it to the east, Yamanashi to the west, Kanagawa to the south, and Saitama to the north. Mainland Tokyo is further subdivided into the special wards (occupying the eastern half) and the Tama area (多摩地域) stretching westwards. Tokyo has a latitude of 35.65 (near the 36th parallel north), which makes it more southern than Rome (41.90), Madrid (40.41), New York City (40.71) and Beijing (39.91).[50]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAnnual rainfall averages nearly 1,600 millimeters (63.0 in), with a wetter summer and a drier winter. The growing season in Tokyo lasts for about 322 days from around mid-February to early January.[71] Snowfall is sporadic, and occurs almost annually.[72] Tokyo often sees typhoons every year, though few are strong. The wettest month since records began in 1876 was October 2004, with 780 millimeters (30 in) of rain,[73] including 270.5 mm (10.65 in) on the ninth of that month.[74] The most recent of four months on record to observe no precipitation is December 1995.[70] Annual precipitation has ranged from 879.5 mm (34.63 in) in 1984 to 2,229.6 mm (87.78 in) in 1938.[70]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n76. **^** \"47662: Tokyo (Japan)\". *ogimet.com*.
