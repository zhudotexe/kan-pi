While serving as \"bed towns\" for those working in central Tokyo, some of them also have a local commercial and industrial base, such as Tachikawa. Collectively, these are often known as the Tama area or Western Tokyo. The far west of the Tama area is occupied by the district (*gun*) of Nishi-Tama. Much of this area is mountainous and unsuitable for urbanization. The highest mountain in Tokyo, Mount Kumotori, is 2,017\u00a0m (6,617\u00a0ft) high; other mountains in Tokyo include Takanosu (1,737\u00a0m (5,699\u00a0ft)), Odake (1,266\u00a0m (4,154\u00a0ft)), and Mitake (929\u00a0m (3,048\u00a0ft)). Lake Okutama, on the Tama River near Yamanashi Prefecture, is Tokyo's largest lake. The district is composed of three towns (Hinode, Mizuho and Okutama) and one village (Hinohara). \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)A satellite photo of Tokyo in 2018 taken by ESA Sentinel-2\n![](image)The Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building\nThe mainland portion of Tokyo lies northwest of Tokyo Bay and measures about 90\u00a0km (56\u00a0mi) east to west and 25\u00a0km (16\u00a0mi) north to south. The average elevation in Tokyo is 40\u00a0m (131\u00a0ft).[49] Chiba Prefecture borders it to the east, Yamanashi to the west, Kanagawa to the south, and Saitama to the north. Mainland Tokyo is further subdivided into the special wards (occupying the eastern half) and the Tama area (\u591a\u6469\u5730\u57df) stretching westwards. Tokyo has a latitude of 35.65 (near the 36th parallel north), which makes it more southern than Rome (41.90), Madrid (40.41), New York City (40.71) and Beijing (39.91).[50]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAnnual rainfall averages nearly 1,600 millimeters (63.0\u00a0in), with a wetter summer and a drier winter. The growing season in Tokyo lasts for about 322 days from around mid-February to early January.[71] Snowfall is sporadic, and occurs almost annually.[72] Tokyo often sees typhoons every year, though few are strong. The wettest month since records began in 1876 was October 2004, with 780 millimeters (30\u00a0in) of rain,[73] including 270.5\u00a0mm (10.65\u00a0in) on the ninth of that month.[74] The most recent of four months on record to observe no precipitation is December 1995.[70] Annual precipitation has ranged from 879.5\u00a0mm (34.63\u00a0in) in 1984 to 2,229.6\u00a0mm (87.78\u00a0in) in 1938.[70]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n76. **^** \"47662: Tokyo (Japan)\". *ogimet.com*.

Some parts of the city have been constructed on reclaimed tidal flats that occur around the area.[49] Thirteen rivers flow through Jakarta. They are Ciliwung River, Kalibaru, Pesanggrahan, Cipinang, Angke River, Maja, Mookervart, Krukut, Buaran, West Tarum, Cakung, Petukangan, Sunter River and Grogol River.[50][51] They flow from the Puncak highlands to the south of the city, then across the city northwards towards the Java Sea. The Ciliwung River divides the city into the western and eastern districts.\n\n\nThese rivers, combined with the wet season rains and insufficient drainage due to clogging, make Jakarta prone to flooding.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Climate data for Jakarta (Kemayoran) (1991\u20132020 normals)\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 36.9(98.4)\n | 34.8(94.6)\n | 36.0(96.8)\n | 35.9(96.6)\n | 36.1(97.0)\n | 36.3(97.3)\n | 35.6(96.1)\n | 35.6(96.1)\n | 37.1(98.8)\n | 37.9(100.2)\n | 37.1(98.8)\n | 36.7(98.1)\n | 37.9(100.2)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 31.0(87.8)\n | 30.8(87.4)\n | 32.1(89.8)\n | 32.8(91.0)\n | 33.2(91.8)\n | 32.9(91.2)\n | 32.7(90.9)\n | 33.0(91.4)\n | 33.4(92.1)\n | 33.4(92.1)\n | 32.8(91.0)\n | 32.0(89.6)\n | 32.5(90.5)\n |\n| Daily mean \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 27.5(81.5)\n | 27.3(81.1)\n | 28.0(82.4)\n | 28.4(83.1)\n | 28.7(83.7)\n | 28.4(83.1)\n | 28.2(82.8)\n | 28.3(82.9)\n | 28.6(83.5)\n | 28.8(83.8)\n | 28.4(83.1)\n | 28.0(82.4)\n | 28.2(82.8)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 25.2(77.4)\n | 25.2(77.4)\n | 25.5(77.9)\n | 25.6(78.1)\n | 25.8(78.4)\n | 25.5(77.9)\n | 25.3(77.5)\n | 25.3(77.5)\n | 25.5(77.9)\n | 25.6(78.1)\n | 25.6(78.1)\n | 25.5(77.9)\n | 25.5(77.9)\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Aerial view of North Jakarta\nJakarta is situated on the northwest coast of Java, at the mouth of the Ciliwung River on Jakarta Bay, an inlet of the Java Sea.

The southern parts of the city are hilly. It is one of only two Asian capital cities located in the southern hemisphere (along with East Timor's Dili). Officially, the area of the Jakarta Special District is 661.23\u00a0km2 (255\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of land area and 6,977\u00a0km2 (2,694\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of sea area.[48] The Thousand Islands, which are administratively a part of Jakarta, are located in Jakarta Bay, north of the city.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Monas, Jakarta's symbol\nThe most famous landmark, which became the symbol of the city, is the 132\u00a0m-tall (433\u00a0ft) obelisk of the National Monument (*Monumen Nasional* or *Monas*) in the centre of Merdeka Square. On its southwest corner stands a Mahabharata-themed Arjuna Wijaya chariot statue and fountain. Further south through Jalan M.H. Thamrin, one of the main avenues, the *Selamat Datang* monument stands on the fountain in the centre of the Hotel Indonesia roundabout. Other landmarks include the Istiqlal Mosque, Jakarta Cathedral and the Immanuel Church. The former Batavia Stadhuis, Sunda Kelapa port in Jakarta Old Town is another landmark. The Autograph Tower in Central Jakarta, at 382.9\u00a0metres is the tallest building in Indonesia.

The city is bordered on its northern, western, and southern sides by the state of Haryana and to the east by that of Uttar Pradesh (UP). Two prominent features of the geography of Delhi are the Yamuna flood plains and the Delhi ridge. The Yamuna River was the historical boundary between Punjab and UP, and its flood plains provide fertile alluvial soil suitable for agriculture but are prone to recurrent floods. The Yamuna, a sacred river in Hinduism, is the only major river flowing through Delhi. The Hindon River separates Ghaziabad from the eastern part of Delhi. The Delhi ridge originates from the Aravalli Range in the south and encircles the west, northeast, and northwest parts of the city. It reaches a height of 318\u00a0m (1,043\u00a0ft) and is a dominant feature of the region.[74]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n88. **^** \"new delhi (safdarjung) extreme weather events in the month of april\" (PDF).

It has a length of 51.9\u00a0km (32\u00a0mi) and a width of 48.48\u00a0km (30\u00a0mi).[*citation needed*] Delhi is included in India's seismic zone-IV, indicating its vulnerability to major earthquakes.[77]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Climate of Delhi\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDelhi ranks fifth among the Indian states and union territories in human development index,[18] and has the second-highest GDP per capita in India (after Goa).[19] Although a union territory, the political administration of the NCT of Delhi today more closely resembles that of a state of India, with its own legislature, high court and an executive council of ministers headed by a chief minister. New Delhi is jointly administered by the federal government of India and the local government of Delhi, and serves as the capital of the nation as well as the NCT of Delhi. Delhi is also the centre of the National Capital Region, which is an \"interstate regional planning\" area created in 1985.[20][21] Delhi hosted the inaugural 1951 Asian Games, the 1982 Asian Games, the 1983 Non-Aligned Movement summit, the 2010 Men's Hockey World Cup, the 2010 Commonwealth Games, and the 2012 BRICS summit and was one of the major host cities of the 2011 Cricket World Cup and 2023 Cricket World Cup\n\n\n\n\n## Toponym[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), Delhi was the most polluted[99] city in the world in 2014. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Delhi\n |\n| --- |\n| City and union territory\n |\n| National Capital Territory of Delhi |\n| ![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nFrom top, left to right: Humayun's Tomb; Qutub Minar; Jama Masjid; Red Fort's Lahori gate; India Gate; Digambar Jain Mandir with Gauri Shankar temple in the background; St. James' Church; Hyderabad House; Lotus Temple, a Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed House of Worship\n |\n| ![Map](image)Interactive map of Delhi\n |\n| Coordinates: 28\u00b036\u203236\u2033N 77\u00b013\u203248\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff28.61000\u00b0N 77.23000\u00b0E\ufeff / 28.61000; 77.23000 |\n| Country | India |\n| Region | North India |\n| Capital, Delhi Sultanate | 1214 |\n| Capital, Mughal Empire | 1526, intermittently with Agra |\n| New Delhi, Capital, British Indian Empire | 12 December 1911 |\n| New Delhi, capital, Dominion of India | 1947 |\n| New Delhi, capital, Republic of India | 26 January 1950 |\n| Union Territory[1][2] | 1 November 1956 |\n| National Capital Territory[3] | 1 February 1992 |\n| Government |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Delhi Metro is widely used in the NCR.\nThe Delhi Metro is a rapid transit system serving Delhi, Ghaziabad, Faridabad, Gurgaon and Noida in the National Capital Region of India. It is the world's tenth-largest metro system by length of lines. It was India's second modern public transportation system. The network consists of 10 colour-coded lines[193] serving 255 stations[c] with a total length of 348.12 kilometres (216.31\u00a0mi).[d] The system has a mix of underground, at-grade, and elevated stations using both broad-gauge and standard-gauge. All stations have escalators, lifts, and tactile tiles to guide the visually impaired from station entrances to trains. There are 18 designated parking sites at the Metro stations. In March 2010, DMRC partnered with Google India (through Google Transit) to provide train schedule and route information to mobile devices with Google Maps.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDelhi features a dry winter humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen *Cwa*) bordering a hot semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen *BSh*). The warm season lasts from 21 March to 15 June with an average daily high temperature above 39\u00a0\u00b0C (102\u00a0\u00b0F). The hottest day of the year is usually witnessed between 26 and 30 May, with an average high of 42\u00a0\u00b0C (108\u00a0\u00b0F) and low of 27\u00a0\u00b0C (81\u00a0\u00b0F).[78] The cold season lasts from 26 November to 9 February with an average daily high temperature below 20\u00a0\u00b0C (68\u00a0\u00b0F). The coldest day of the year is usually witnessed between 16 and 20 January, with an average low of 7\u00a0\u00b0C (45\u00a0\u00b0F) and high of 20\u00a0\u00b0C (68\u00a0\u00b0F).[78] In early March, the wind direction changes from north-westerly to south-westerly. From April to October the weather is hot. The monsoon arrives at the end of June, along with an increase in humidity.[*citation needed*] The brief, mild winter starts in late November, peaks in January and heavy fog often occurs.[79]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAccording to the UN this makes Delhi urban area the world's second-largest urban area after Tokyo,[8] although Demographia declares the Jakarta urban area to be the second-largest.[200] The 2011 census provided two figures for urban area population: 16,314,838 within the NCT boundary,[201] and 21,753,486 for the *Extended Urban Area*.[202] The 2021 regional plan released by the Government of India renamed the *Extended Urban Area* from *Delhi Metropolitan Area (DMA)* as defined by the 2001 plan,[203] to *Central National Capital Region (CNCR)*.[203][204] Around 49% of the population of Delhi lives in slums and unauthorised colonies without any civic amenities.[205] The majority of these slums have inadequate provisions to the basic facilities and according to a DUSIB report, almost 22% of the people do open defecation.[206]\n\n\n\n* ![The Birla temple in Delhi with its towers.](image)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Rapid Transit | Delhi Metro |\n| Literacy (2011) | 86.21%[11] |\n| Sex ratio (2011) | 868 \u2640/1000 \u2642[11] |\n| Website | delhi.gov.in |\n\n\n**Delhi**,[a] officially the **National Capital Territory** (**NCT**) **of Delhi**, is a city and a union territory of India containing New Delhi, the capital of India. Lying on both sides of the Yamuna river, but chiefly to the west, or beyond its right bank, Delhi shares borders with the state of Uttar Pradesh in the east and with the state of Haryana in the remaining directions. Delhi became a union territory on 1 November 1956 and the NCT in 1995.[15] The NCT covers an area of 1,484 square kilometres (573\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).[5] According to the 2011 census, Delhi's city proper population was over 11\u00a0million,[6][16] while the NCT's population was about 16.8\u00a0million.[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMost of Delhi's residents are unaware of alarming levels of air pollution in the city and the health risks associated with it.[110][111] In 2020, annual average PM2.5 in the city stood at 107.6\u00a0\u00b5g/m\u00b3, which is almost 21.5 times the WHO's PM2.5 Guideline (5\u00a0\u00b5g/m\u00b3; set in September 2021).[120] These pollution levels are estimated to reduce the life expectancy of an average person living in Delhi by almost 10.1 years.[120]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

In winter, cold northerly winds from Siberia can cause nighttime temperatures to drop below freezing, and although not usually associated with snow, the city can receive one or two days of snowfall per year. In contrast, and in spite of being the peak tourist season, summer in Shanghai is very warm and humid, with occasional downpours or freak thunderstorms. The city is also susceptible to typhoons, none of which in recent years has caused considerable damage.[12] The most pleasant seasons are Spring, although changeable, and Autumn, which is generally sunny and dry.\n\n\n**Climate statistics of 2013:**[13]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Pudong | * Oriental Pearl Tower\n* Jin Mao Tower\n* Shanghai World Financial Center\n* Shanghai Tower\n* Bocom Financial Towers\n* Shanghai IFC\n* One Lujiazui\n* Bank of Shanghai\n |\n| Puxi | * K11\n* Shimao International Plaza\n* Plaza 66\n* White Magnolia Plaza\n* Shanghai Wheelock Square\n* Tomorrow Square\n* Grand Gateway Shanghai\n |\n\n |\n| Sportsvenues | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Football | * Shanghai\n* Hongkou\n* Pudong\n* Jinshan\n* Yuanshen\n* Zhabei\n |\n| Indoor | * Jiangwan\n* Luwan\n* Shanghai Indoor\n* Mercedes-Benz\n* Int'l Gym\n* Oriental\n |\n| Other | * Tennis\n\t+ Qizhong\n\n\n* Motorsport circuit\n\t+ International\n\t+ Street\n\t+ Tianma\n\n\n* Cycling\n\t+ Tour of Chongming Island\n\n\n* Golf\n\t+ BMW Masters\n\t+ Sheshan Golf Club\n\n\n* Horse racing\n\t+ Shanghai Race Club\n |\n\n |\n| Sportsteams | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Football | * Shenhua\n* Port\n* Jiading Huilong\n |\n| Other | * Basketball\n\t+ Sharks\n |\n\n |\n| Transport | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Airports | * Hongqiao\n* Pudong\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Shanghai now the world's largest cargo port\u00a0!\".

The distance is covered by two highways, the Anchieta and the Imigrantes, (see \"Transportation\" below) that roll down the range, leading to the port city of Santos and the beach resort of Guaruj\u00e1. Rolling terrain prevails within the urbanized areas of S\u00e3o Paulo except in its northern area, where the Serra da Cantareira Range reaches a higher elevation and a sizable remnant of the Atlantic Rain Forest. The region is seismically stable and no significant activity has ever been recorded.[31]\n\n\n\n### Hydrography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nTiet\u00ea River, with the Marginal Tiet\u00ea\n![](image)\nBillings Reservoir\n\nSee also: Water management in the Metropolitan Region of S\u00e3o Paulo\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe metropolis is also home to several of the tallest skyscrapers in Brazil, including the Mirante do Vale, Edif\u00edcio It\u00e1lia, Banespa, North Tower and many others.

It is home to monuments, parks and museums such as the Latin American Memorial, the Ibirapuera Park, Museum of Ipiranga, S\u00e3o Paulo Museum of Art, and the Museum of the Portuguese Language. The city holds events like the S\u00e3o Paulo Jazz Festival, S\u00e3o Paulo Art Biennial, the Brazilian Grand Prix, S\u00e3o Paulo Fashion Week, the ATP Brasil Open, the Brasil Game Show and the Comic Con Experience.

Compared to other global cities (such as the island cities of New York City and Hong Kong), however, S\u00e3o Paulo is considered a \"low-rise building\" city. Its tallest buildings rarely reach forty stories, and the average residential building is twenty. Nevertheless, it is the fourth city in the world in quantity of buildings, according to the page specialized in research of data on buildings *Emporis Buildings*,[174] besides possessing what was considered until 2014 the tallest skyscraper of the country, the Mirante do Vale, also known as *Pal\u00e1cio Zarzur Kogan*, with 170 meters of height and 51 floors.[175]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Climate data for S\u00e3o Paulo (Horto Florestal, 1961\u20131990)\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 34.6(94.3)\n | 35.8(96.4)\n | 33.4(92.1)\n | 32.0(89.6)\n | 29.5(85.1)\n | 29.4(84.9)\n | 29.0(84.2)\n | 33.2(91.8)\n | 35.2(95.4)\n | 34.3(93.7)\n | 34.6(94.3)\n | 33.9(93.0)\n | 35.8(96.4)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 27.0(80.6)\n | 27.8(82.0)\n | 27.3(81.1)\n | 24.9(76.8)\n | 23.0(73.4)\n | 22.0(71.6)\n | 22.0(71.6)\n | 23.7(74.7)\n | 24.5(76.1)\n | 24.7(76.5)\n | 25.7(78.3)\n | 26.3(79.3)\n | 24.9(76.8)\n |\n| Daily mean \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 21.2(70.2)\n | 21.6(70.9)\n | 21.1(70.0)\n | 18.8(65.8)\n | 16.7(62.1)\n | 15.6(60.1)\n | 15.1(59.2)\n | 16.4(61.5)\n | 17.6(63.7)\n | 18.5(65.3)\n | 19.5(67.1)\n | 20.6(69.1)\n | 18.6(65.4)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 16.6(61.9)\n | 16.9(62.4)\n | 16.3(61.3)\n | 14.1(57.4)\n | 11.7(53.1)\n | 10.5(50.9)\n | 9.7(49.5)\n | 10.9(51.6)\n | 12.4(54.3)\n | 13.7(56.7)\n | 14.6(58.3)\n | 16.0(60.8)\n | 13.6(56.5)\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n29. **^** Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE). \"S\u00e3o Paulo\".
