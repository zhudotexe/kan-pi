The war would be determined on the continent, and the major land operations that sealed the swift French victory involved the Ulm Campaign, a large wheeling manoeuvre by the *Grande Arm\u00e9e* lasting from late August to mid-October 1805 that captured an entire Austrian army, and the decisive French victory over a combined Austro-Russian force under Alexander I of Russia at the Battle of Austerlitz in early December. Austerlitz effectively brought the Third Coalition to an end, although later there was a small side campaign against Naples, which also resulted in a decisive French victory at the Battle of Campo Tenese.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAusterlitz had driven neither Russia nor Britain, whose fleet protected Sicily from a French invasion, to cease fighting. Meanwhile, Prussian worries about the growing French influence in Central Europe sparked the War of the Fourth Coalition in 1806.\n\n\n\n\n## Periodisation[edit]\n\n\nHistorians differ on when the War of the Third Coalition began and when it ended. From the British perspective, the war started when Britain declared war on France on 18 May 1803, but it was still on its own. It was not until December 1804 when Sweden entered into an alliance with the United Kingdom, not until 11 April 1805 when Russia joined the alliance, not until 16 July when Britain and Russia ratified their treaty of alliance, and only thereafter Austria (9 August) and Naples\u2013Sicily (11 September) completed the fully-fledged coalition.[1]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| **Austrian Empire:**20,000 killed or wounded70,000 captured**Russia:**25,000 killed or wounded25,000 captured**Naples:**20,000 killed, wounded or captured**Total casualties:**160,000 killed, wounded or captured | **France:**13,500 killed37,000 wounded5,000 captured**Italy:**350 killed1,900 wounded**Spain:**1,200 killed1,600 wounded**Bavaria:**300 killed1,200 wounded\n\n---\n\n**Total casualties:**62,050 killed, wounded or captured |\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nWar of the Third Coalition\n |\n| --- |\n| German campaign\n* Bavaria\n* **Ulm campaign**\n\t+ Donauw\u00f6rth\n\t+ Wertingen\n\t+ G\u00fcnzburg\n\t+ Haslach-Jungingen\n\t+ Memmingen\n\t+ Elchingen\n\t+ Ulm\n* Mehrnbach\n* Lambach\n* Steyr\n* Amstetten\n* Mariazell\n* D\u00fcrenstein\n* Dornbirn\n* Sch\u00f6ngrabern\n* Hanover\n* Wischau\n* **Austerlitz**\n\n\nItalian campaign\n* Verona\n* Caldiero\n* Forano\n* Caldiero pursuit\n* Castelfranco Veneto\n\n\nInvasion of Naples\n* Gaeta\n* Campo Tenese\n* Maida\n* Calabria\n* Mileto\n\n\nTrafalgar campaign\n* Diamond Rock\n* Cape Finisterre\n* **Trafalgar**\n* Cape Ortegal\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMeanwhile, Bavaria sided with France on 25 August, and W\u00fcrttemberg joined Napoleon on 5 September. No major hostilities between France and any member of the coalition other than Britain (Trafalgar campaign March\u2013November 1805) occurred until the Ulm Campaign (25 September \u2013 20 October 1805). This was in part because Napoleon's planned invasion of the United Kingdom was not called off until 27 August 1805, when he decided to use his invasion force camped at Boulogne against Austria instead.[1]\n\n\nLikewise, no major battles occurred after the Battle of Austerlitz and the signing of the Peace of Pressburg on 26 December 1805, which forced Austria to leave the Third Coalition and cease hostilities against France. Some historians conclude that Austria's departure \"shattered the fragile Third Coalition\"[1] and \"ended the War of the Third Coalition\".[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThis narrative leaves out the subsequent French invasion of Naples (February\u2013July 1806), which the occupying Anglo-Russian troops hastily evacuated and the remaining Neapolitan forces relatively quickly surrendered. Other scholars argue the southern Italian campaign should be included into the War of the Second Coalition, and criticise ignoring the Mediterranean front by only focusing on land battles in Central Europe and the Trafalgar campaign.[3]\n\n\n\n## Prelude[edit]\n\n\nEurope had been embroiled in the French Revolutionary Wars since 1792. After five years of war, the French Republic subdued the armies of the First Coalition in 1797. A Second Coalition was formed in 1798, but this too was defeated by 1801, leaving Britain the only opponent of the new French Consulate.[4]\n\n\n\n### From Amiens to the Third Coalition[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| France,client statesand allies | * France\n* Polish Legions\n* Italy\n* Holland\n* Etruria\n* Swiss Confederation\n* Naples\n* Confederation of the Rhine\n\t+ Bavaria\n\t+ Saxony\n\t+ Westphalia\n\t+ W\u00fcrttemberg\n* Denmark\u2013Norway\n* Ottoman Empire\n* Persia\n* Spain\n |\n| Coalitionforces | * United Kingdom\n* Austria\n* Russia\n* Prussia\n* Spain\n* Portugal\n* Sicily\n* Papal States\n* Ottoman Empire\n* Persia\n* Sardinia\n* Sweden\n* Netherlands\n* Brunswick\n* Hanover\n* Nassau\n* French Royalists\n |\n\n |\n| Majorbattles | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFollowing the surrender, Mass\u00e9na was ordered south by Joseph to support Reynier's II Corps against the British and the Calabrian insurrection. Now severely outnumbered in mainland Italy, the British retreated back to Sicily. However, the revolt was not suppressed until 1807, by which time Mass\u00e9na had already requested permission to relinquish command. For the first time in the Napoleonic Wars, the French experienced a brutal guerrilla war carried on by a rebellious population. The French gleaned that the only effective way to deal with such an uprising was to implement terror tactics employed by Reynier. This foreshadowed the same problems the French, and in particular Joseph Bonaparte, would face in Spain during the Peninsular War.\n\n\n\n## Results[edit]\n\n\n![](image)All the participants of the War of the Third Coalition.

          "content": "Here are the summaries of the articles on Napoleon, George III, and Charles XIII:\n\n### Napoleon\nNapoleon Bonaparte was a French military leader who rose to prominence during the French Revolution and led several successful campaigns during the Revolutionary Wars. He became Emperor of the French in 1804 and led France in the Napoleonic Wars. His major victories include the Battle of Austerlitz, which led to the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire, and the Battle of Wagram. However, his invasion of Russia in 1812 ended disastrously, leading to his downfall. He was eventually defeated by the Sixth Coalition and exiled to the island of Elba. He escaped, returned to power for a brief period known as the Hundred Days, but was finally defeated at the Battle of Waterloo and exiled to Saint Helena, where he died.\n\n### George III\nGeorge III was the King of Great Britain and Ireland during a period that included the American Revolutionary War, the French Revolutionary Wars, and the Napoleonic Wars. His reign saw the loss of the American colonies and the struggle against Napoleonic France. He suffered from recurrent mental illness, which led to periods of regency by his son, the future George IV. Despite his personal challenges, his reign saw significant events such as the passing of the Slave Trade Act 1807 and the Acts of Union 1800, which created the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.\n\n### Charles XIII\nCharles XIII was King of Sweden and Norway. He initially served as regent for his nephew, Gustav IV, after the assassination of Gustav III. His reign was marked by political instability and the influence of his regent, Gustaf Adolf Reuterholm. Charles XIII had no natural heirs, and his incapacity led to the adoption of Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte, one of Napoleon's generals, as his successor. Bernadotte became Charles XIV John of Sweden. Charles XIII's reign saw the union of Sweden and Norway, and he died in 1818.",

In July 1806, under massive pressure from France, Bavaria and fifteen other German states ratified the statutes founding the Confederation of the Rhine, with Napoleon designated Protector, and they announced to the Imperial Diet their intention to leave the Empire with immediate effect. Then, on 22 July, Napoleon issued an ultimatum to Francis demanding that he abdicate as Holy Roman Emperor by 10 August.[9][10] Five days later, Francis bowed to the inevitable and, without mentioning the ultimatum, affirmed that since the Peace of Pressburg he had tried his best to fulfil his duties as emperor but that circumstances had convinced him that he could no longer rule according to his oath of office, the formation of the Confederation of the Rhine making that impossible. \n</fragment>\n</document>",

Although the French were victorious in the initial battles during the campaign in Germany, the entry of Austria into the war led to France's decisive defeat at the Battle of Leipzig in the autumn of 1813, which proved to be a massive victory for the Coalition. Following the battle, the Pro-French Confederation of the Rhine collapsed, thereby ending Napoleon's hold on territory east of the Rhine forever.

Facing them in the theatre were the French forces numbering only about 70,000 men. In spite of being heavily outnumbered, Napoleon defeated the divided Coalition forces in the battles at Brienne and La Rothi\u00e8re, but could not stop the Coalition's advance and triumphant victory over Napoleon. Austrian Emperor Francis I and King Frederick William III of Prussia felt demoralized upon hearing about Napoleon's victories since the start of the campaign. They even considered ordering a general retreat. But Alexander was far more determined than ever to victoriously enter Paris whatever the cost, imposing his will upon Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg, and the wavering monarchs.[43] On 28 March, Coalition forces advanced towards Paris and prepared to launch an assault.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Napoleon shattered this coalition with victories in the Ulm campaign and at the Battle of Austerlitz, which led to the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire. In 1806, the Fourth Coalition took up arms against him. Napoleon defeated Prussia at the battles of Jena and Auerstedt, marched the *Grande Arm\u00e9e* into Eastern Europe, and defeated the Russians in June 1807 at Friedland, forcing the defeated nations of the Fourth Coalition to accept the Treaties of Tilsit. Two years later, the Austrians challenged the French again during the War of the Fifth Coalition, but Napoleon solidified his grip over Europe after triumphing at the Battle of Wagram.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| France,client statesand allies | * France\n* Polish Legions\n* Italy\n* Holland\n* Etruria\n* Swiss Confederation\n* Naples\n* Confederation of the Rhine\n\t+ Bavaria\n\t+ Saxony\n\t+ Westphalia\n\t+ W\u00fcrttemberg\n* Denmark\u2013Norway\n* Ottoman Empire\n* Persia\n* Spain\n |\n| Coalitionforces | * United Kingdom\n* Austria\n* Russia\n* Prussia\n* Spain\n* Portugal\n* Sicily\n* Papal States\n* Ottoman Empire\n* Persia\n* Sardinia\n* Sweden\n* Netherlands\n* Brunswick\n* Hanover\n* Nassau\n* French Royalists\n |\n\n |\n| Majorbattles | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nthe event commemorated in the officially sanctioned painting by Jacques-Louis David.[136] Jos\u00e9phine became only the second queen to be crowned and anointed in French history, other than Marie de' Medici.[138]\n\n\nNapoleon was then crowned King of Italy, with the Iron Crown of Lombardy, at the Cathedral of Milan on 26 May 1805.

By April 1805, Britain had also signed an alliance with Russia.[141] Austria had been defeated by France twice in recent memory and wanted revenge, so it joined the coalition a few months later.[142]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe French suffered in the course of a ruinous retreat, including from the harshness of the Russian Winter.

France declared war on Great Britain in 1793; in response to the crisis, George allowed Pitt to increase taxes, raise armies, and suspend the right of *habeas corpus*. The First Coalition to oppose revolutionary France, which included Austria, Prussia, and Spain, broke up in 1795 when Prussia and Spain made separate peace with France.[109] The Second Coalition, which included Austria, Russia, and the Ottoman Empire, was defeated in 1800. Only Great Britain was left fighting Napoleon Bonaparte, the First Consul of the French Republic.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 1804, George's recurrent illness returned; after his recovery, Addington resigned and Pitt regained power. Pitt sought to appoint Fox to his ministry, but George refused. Lord Grenville perceived an injustice to Fox, and refused to join the new ministry.[8] Pitt concentrated on forming a coalition with Austria, Russia, and Sweden. This Third Coalition, however, met the same fate as the First and Second Coalitions, collapsing in 1805. The setbacks in Europe took a toll on Pitt's health, and he died in 1806, reopening the question of who should serve in the ministry. Grenville became Prime Minister, and his \"Ministry of All the Talents\" included Fox. Grenville pushed through the Slave Trade Act 1807, which passed both houses of Parliament with large majorities.[122] George was conciliatory towards Fox, after being forced to capitulate over his appointment. After Fox's death in September 1806, the King and ministry were in open conflict. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWith the setbacks in America, Lord North asked to transfer power to Lord Chatham, whom he thought more capable, but George refused to do so; he suggested instead that Chatham serve as a subordinate minister in North's administration, but Chatham refused; he died later in the same year.[68] North was allied to the \"King's Friends\" in Parliament and believed that George III had the right to exercise powers.[69] In early 1778, Louis XVI of France (Britain's chief rival) signed a treaty of alliance with the United States.[70] The French fleet outran the British naval blockade of the Mediterranean and sailed to America.[70] The conflict now affected America, Europe, and India.[70] Charles III of Spain had misgivings because of his own colonies but decided to side with France in the war in limited fashion in 1779.[71] One faction of the Dutch Republic aided the Americans, whereas another aided Britain, whose allies included Loyalists and German auxiliaries. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn Great Britain, George III used the official style \"George the Third, by the Grace of God, King of Great Britain, France, and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, and so forth\". In 1801, when Great Britain united with Ireland, he dropped the title of king of France, which had been used for every English monarch since Edward III's claim to the French throne in the medieval period.[111] His style became \"George the Third, by the Grace of God, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland King, Defender of the Faith.\"[154]\n\n\nIn Germany, he was \"Duke of Brunswick and L\u00fcneburg, Arch-Treasurer and Prince-elector of the Holy Roman Empire\" (*Herzog von Braunschweig und L\u00fcneburg, Erzschatzmeister und Kurf\u00fcrst des Heiligen R\u00f6mischen Reiches*[155]) until the end of the empire in 1806. He then continued as duke until the Congress of Vienna declared him \"King of Hanover\" in 1814.[154]\n\n\n\n### Honours[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Thomas, Peter D. G.

The marriage negotiations of the young king disturbed the relationship to Russia, and the alliance with revolutionary France was greatly disliked by other powers.[5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn the assassination of Gustav III in 1792, Charles acted as regent of Sweden until 1796 on behalf of his nephew, King Gustav IV, who was a minor when his father was shot in the Stockholm opera. Gustav III had designated him regent in his earlier will. When he was dying, he altered the will, and while still appointing Charles regent of his minor son, he was no longer to rule absolute, but restricted by a government consisted of the supporters of Gustav III.[5] After the death of the monarch, however, Charles successfully contested the will and was given unlimited power as sole regent.[5]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe autumn of 1789, Hedvig Elisabeth Charlotte wished to depose Gustav III and place her husband Duke Charles upon the throne.[12] Her ideal was the Swedish Constitution of 1772, which she saw as a good tool for an enlightened aristocracy, and the war and the Union and Security Act had made her a leading part of the opposition. She cooperated with Prince Frederick Adolf of Sweden and Gustaf Adolf Reuterholm.[12] The plan was to force Charles to act as a symbol of the opposition to the Union and Security Act when the time was right.[12] When the time arrived to make Charles act, however, he refused, which effectively foiled the coup.[12]\n\n\nCharles was in close connection to the opposition against Gustav III, and it is debated whether he knew of and supported the plans to assassinate the king.[13]\n\n\n\n## Reign of Gustav IV Adolf[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1654\u20131751 | * Charles X Gustav\n* Charles XI\n* Charles XII\n* Ulrika Eleonora\n* *Frederick I*\n |\n\n |\n| Holstein-Gottorp (Oldenburg) | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1751\u20131818 | * Adolf Frederick\n* Gustav III\n* Gustav IV Adolf\n* Charles XIII2\n |\n\n |\n| Bernadotte | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| since 1818 | * Charles XIV John2\n* Oscar I2\n* Charles XV2\n* Oscar II2\n* Gustaf V\n* Gustaf VI Adolf\n* Carl XVI Gustaf\n |\n\n |\n| * 1 Lineage uncertain\n* 2 Also Norwegian monarch\n* 3 Also Norwegian and Danish monarch\n* 4 Also king of Poland\n |\n\n| Authority control databases ![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\n |\n| --- |\n| International | * FAST\n* ISNI\n\t+ 2\n* VIAF\n* WorldCat\n |\n| National | * Germany\n* Italy\n* Finland\n* United States\n* Sweden\n* Netherlands\n |\n| Artists | * KulturNav\n |\n| People | * Deutsche Biographie\n |\n| Other | * IdRef\n* Te Papa (New Zealand)\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1387\u20131523 | - Margaret ds\n\n- Eric III ds\n\n- Christopher ds\n\n- *Charles I* s\n\n- Christian I ds\n\n- John ds\n\n- Christian II ds\n |\n\n |\n| Denmark\u2013Norway | *\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1524\u20131814 | - Frederick I d\n\n- Christian III d\n\n- Frederick II d\n\n- Christian IV d\n\n- Frederick III d\n\n- Christian V d\n\n- Frederick IV d\n\n- Christian VI d\n\n- Frederick V d\n\n- Christian VII d\n\n- Frederick VI d\n |\n\n |\n| II.

The initial choice was a Danish prince, Christian August, who took the name Charles August upon being adopted by Charles. However, Charles August died only a few months after his arrival in Sweden. One of Napoleon's generals, Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte, was then chosen as his successor. The new crown prince took over the government as soon as he landed in Sweden in 1810. Charles's condition deteriorated every year, especially after 1812, and he eventually became but a mute witness during the government councils chaired by the crown prince, having lost his memory and no longer being able to communicate.[5]\n\n\nBy the Union of Sweden and Norway on 4 November 1814 Charles became king of Norway under the name **Carl II of Norway**.

He became Emperor of the French in 1804 and led France in the Napoleonic Wars. His major victories include the Battle of Austerlitz, which led to the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire, and the Battle of Wagram. However, his invasion of Russia in 1812 ended disastrously, leading to his downfall. He was eventually defeated by the Sixth Coalition and exiled to the island of Elba. He escaped, returned to power for a brief period known as the Hundred Days, but was finally defeated at the Battle of Waterloo and exiled to Saint Helena, where he died.\n\n### George III\nGeorge III was the King of Great Britain and Ireland during a period that included the American Revolutionary War, the French Revolutionary Wars, and the Napoleonic Wars. His reign saw the loss of the American colonies and the struggle against Napoleonic France. He suffered from recurrent mental illness, which led to periods of regency by his son, the future George IV. Despite his personal challenges, his reign saw significant events such as the passing of the Slave Trade Act 1807 and the Acts of Union 1800, which created the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.\n\n### Charles XIII\nCharles XIII was King of Sweden and Norway. He initially served as regent for his nephew, Gustav IV, after the assassination of Gustav III. His reign was marked by political instability and the influence of his regent, Gustaf Adolf Reuterholm. Charles XIII had no natural heirs, and his incapacity led to the adoption of Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte, one of Napoleon's generals, as his successor. Bernadotte became Charles XIV John of Sweden. Charles XIII's reign saw the union of Sweden and Norway, and he died in 1818.",
