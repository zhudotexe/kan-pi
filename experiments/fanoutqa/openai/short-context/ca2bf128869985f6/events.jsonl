The Polytechnic Marathon (also known as the *Poly*) was first held in 1909.[5]\n\n\nThe current London Marathon was founded in 1981 by Olympic champion and journalist Chris Brasher and athlete John Disley.[6][7] Shortly after completing the New York City Marathon in November 1979 Brasher wrote an article for *The Observer* newspaper which began:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe first London Marathon was held on 29 March 1981, more than 20,000 applied to run. 6,747 were accepted and 6,255 crossed the finish line on Constitution Hill. The Marathon's popularity has steadily grown since then. As at 2009, 746,635 people have completed the race since its inception.[6] In 2010, 36,549 people crossed the line, the biggest field since the race began.[9] The first wheelchair marathon race was held in 1983 and the event was credited with reducing the stigma surrounding disabled athletes.[10] In 2013 the IPC Athletics Marathon World Cup was held within the London Marathon featuring athletes of both genders in the T42–T46 and T11–T13 categories.[11] In August 2013 it was announced that the event would be staged in London until 2017 and feature athletes in the T11-T12, T13, T42-T44, T43, T45-46, T51-52 and the T53-54 class.[12]\n\n\nFor many years the London and Polytechnic Marathons competed with each other until, in 1996, the latter folded in due to the popularity of the former.[5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAnnual race held in London, England\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| London Marathon |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) |\n| Date | April |\n| Location | London, United Kingdom |\n| Event type | Road |\n| Distance | Marathon |\n| Established | 29 March 1981; 43 years ago (1981-03-29) |\n| Course records | Men: 2:01:25 (Kelvin Kiptum, 2023)Women: 2:15:25 (Paula Radcliffe, 2003)Wheelchair men: 1:23:44 (Marcel Hug, 2023)Wheelchair women: 1:38:24 (Catherine Debrunner, 2022) |\n| Official site | www.tcslondonmarathon.com |\n| ![](image) *2024 London Marathon* |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n22. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** \"Interactive Marathon Map\". *BBC News*. 23 April 2009.

In the first race, the course took a diversion around Southwark Park before re-joining Jamaica Road on the way to Tower Bridge and was routed through St Katherine Docks past the Tower Hotel, en route to the Tower of London and the cobblestoned stretch of road that in later years was carpeted, to help runners prevent injury on the uneven surface. In 1982, the finishing post was moved from Constitution Hill to Westminster Bridge due to construction works. It remained there for twelve years before moving to its present location at The Mall. In 2005, the route around the Isle of Dogs between 22 and 34 kilometres (14 and 21 mi) was switched from a clockwise to an anti-clockwise direction, and at 35 km (22 miles) the route was diverted to avoid St Katherine Docks and the cobblestoned area near the Tower of London. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 2008, a suspected gas leak at a pub in Wapping diverted the course, but in 2009 the race followed the same path as in 2007.[24][25]\n\n\nSince 2012 mile 21 has become a significant cheer zone with Run Dem Crew transforming the stretch of Commercial Road outside the former Limehouse Town Hall into a street party with music and confetti cannons.[26]\n\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 London Marathon was run on a non-traditional course, consisting of 19.6 laps of length 2.15 kilometres (1.34 mi) around St James's Park, taking in The Mall, Horse Guards Parade, Birdcage Walk and Buckingham Palace. The final circuit was 1,345 metres (0.84 mi) along the Mall, following the finish line of the traditional London Marathon course.[27]\n\n\n\n## Results[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of winners of the London Marathon\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Paula Radcliffe, women's winner of the 2005 race\nLondon is one of the top six world marathons that form the World Marathon Majors competition with a million prize purse.[28] The inaugural marathon had 7,741 entrants, 6,255 of whom completed the race.[29] The first Men's Elite Race in 1981 was tied between American Dick Beardsley and Norwegian Inge Simonsen, who crossed the finish line holding hands in 2 hours, 11 minutes, 48 seconds.[30] The first Women's Elite Race, also in 1981, was won by Briton Joyce Smith in 2:29:57.[30] In 1983, the first wheelchair races took place. Organized by the British Sports Association for the Disabled (BASD), 19 people competed and 17 finished. Gordon Perry of the United Kingdom won the Men's Wheelchair Race, coming in at 3:20:07, and Denise Smith, also of the UK, won the Women's Wheelchair Race in 4:29:03.[31]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSince 2006, the elite race has been part of the World Marathon Majors, which includes six of the world's top level marathon races. The London Marathon has seen the marathon world record broken on seven occasions: Khalid Khannouchi broke the men's record in 2002, while women's records have been broken by Grete Waitz (1983), Ingrid Kristiansen (1985), Paula Radcliffe (2002, 2003, 2005) and Mary Jepkosgei Keitany (2017). The current elite course records are held by Kelvin Kiptum (2:01:25 in 2023) and Paula Radcliffe (2:15:25 in 2003). The current wheelchair course records are held by Marcel Hug (1:23:44 in 2023) and Catherine Debrunner (1:38:24 in 2022). The race often has a title sponsorship, it has been branded the \"TCS London Marathon\" since 2022.\n\n\n\n\n## Editions[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe race has several components: it has a mass race for the public, professional races for men and women long-distance runners, elite level wheelchair races for men and women, plus a 3-mile mini marathon event for under-17 athletes. The mass race is the largest marathon event in the United Kingdom and its third largest running event (after the Great North Run and Great Manchester Run). There is a significant charity running aspect to the marathon, with participants helping to raise over £1 billion since its founding, including £66.4 million at the 2019 London Marathon which was the highest amount for a single-day fund-raising event.[1]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Logo used from 2013 to 2021 under Virgin Money sponsorship.\nThe original sponsors of the London Marathon were Gillette, who sponsored the event from 1981 to 1983. Subsequent sponsors have been Mars (1984–1988), ADT (1989–1992), NutraSweet (1993–1995), and Flora (1996–2009).[42][43] Virgin Money sponsored the marathon from 2010, after signing a five-year £17m sponsorship deal in 2008.[44] In April 2013, the London Marathon renewed its sponsorship deal with Virgin Money for a further five years and the race changed its name to the Virgin Money London Marathon.[45][46] In 2021 it was announced that Indian consultancy company Tata Consultancy Services would take over sponsorship of the London Marathon from 2022.[47]\n\n\nA number of other companies and organisations also use the event for brand identification and marketing, including New Balance,[48] Lucozade Sport,[49] and Fuller's Brewery.[50]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* London Triathlon\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 2011, Chalke raised a new record £2.32 million.[35] The £500 that Claire Squires collected before the race increased to over £1 million after she died having collapsed during the 2012 race.[36]\n\n\nA small number of runners, known as the \"Ever Presents\", have completed each of the London Marathons since 1981.

It is traditionally held on Patriots' Day, the third Monday of April.[1] Begun in 1897, the event was inspired by the success of the first marathon competition in the 1896 Summer Olympics.[2] The Boston Marathon is the world's oldest annual marathon and ranks as one of the world's best-known road racing events. It is one of six World Marathon Majors. Its course runs from Hopkinton in southern Middlesex County to Copley Square in Boston.\n\n\nThe Boston Athletic Association (B.A.A.) has organized this event annually since 1897,[3] including a \"virtual alternative\" after the 2020 road race was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The race has been managed by DMSE Sports since 1988. Amateur and professional runners from all over the world compete in the Boston Marathon each year, braving the hilly Massachusetts terrain and varying weather to take part in the race.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn April 19, 1897, ten years after the establishment of the B.A.A., the association held the 24.5 miles (39.4 km) marathon to conclude its athletic competition, the B.A.A. Games.[3] The winner of the inaugural edition was John J. \"JJ\" McDermott,[4] who ran the 24.5 mile course in 2:55:10, leading a field of 15. The event was scheduled for the recently established holiday of Patriots' Day, with the race linking the Athenian and American struggles for liberty.[8] The race, which became known as the Boston Marathon, has been held in some form every year since then, even during the World War years and the Great Depression, making it the world's oldest annual marathon. In 1924, the starting line was moved from Metcalf's Mill in Ashland to the neighboring town of Hopkinton. The course was lengthened to 26 miles 385 yards (42.195 km) to conform to the standard set by the 1908 Summer Olympics and codified by the IAAF in 1921.[9] The first 1.9 miles (3.1 km) are run in Hopkinton before the runners enter Ashland.[10]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe event attracts 500,000 spectators along the route, making it New England's most viewed sporting event.[4] Starting with just 15 participants in 1897, the event has grown to an average of about 30,000 registered participants each year, with 30,251 people entering in 2015.[5] The Centennial Boston Marathon in 1996 established a record as the world's largest marathon with 38,708 entrants, 36,748 starters, and 35,868 finishers.[4]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of winners of the Boston Marathon\n\n![](image)Boston Marathon Finish Line, 1910.\nThe Boston Marathon was first run in April 1897, having been inspired by the revival of the marathon for the 1896 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece.

For most of its history, the Boston Marathon was a free event, and the only prize awarded for winning the race was a wreath woven from olive branches.[11] However, corporate-sponsored cash prizes began to be awarded in the 1980s, when professional athletes refused to run the race unless a cash award was available. The first cash prize for winning the marathon was awarded in 1986.[12]\n\n\nWalter A. Brown was the President of the Boston Athletic Association from 1941 to 1964.[13] During the height of the Korean War in 1951, Brown denied Koreans entry into the Boston Marathon. He stated: \"While American soldiers are fighting and dying in Korea, every Korean should be fighting to protect his country instead of training for marathons. As long as the war continues there, we positively will not accept Korean entries for our race on April 19.\"[14]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n44. **^** Golen, Jimmy (May 28, 2020). \"Boston Marathon canceled for 1st time in 124-year history\". *The Associated Press*.

Held annually since 1974,[a] the event includes multiple races over the marathon distance of 42.195 kilometres (26.219 mi), including elite level road running competitions for men and women, a race for the public, an inline skating race, a wheelchair race, and a handcycle race.\n\n\nEvents are split over two days, with skaters competing on the marathon course on Saturday before the running events. Power walkers, hand-bikers, wheelchair riders, and a children's marathon (4.2195 kilometres (2.6219 mi), 1/10 of the regular distance)[4] are also part of the marathon weekend, which is organised by SCC EVENTS. The elite running and wheelchair races are part of the World Marathon Majors, an annual series of top level races offering a $1 million prize purse. BMW is the current title sponsor for the race.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Eliud Kipchoge running world record (2:01:09) at the 2022 Berlin Marathon\nThe Berlin Marathon was established in 1974 by Horst Milde, a baker and running enthusiast in the city. The race had 244 finishers; 234 men and 10 women, and was won by Günter Hallas and Jutta von Haase in times of 2:44:53 and 3:22:01 respectively. In 1977, Christa Vahlensieck established a new women's world record at the Berlin Marathon, running 2:34:47. Four years later, the race started outside the Reichstag for the first time, by which time it had grown to 2,583 finishers, making it the largest city road race in Germany. The following year, before German unification, some East Germans secretly ran the race, registering under false names to avoid recriminations from the East German secret service. In 1989, a children's race was added to the event, and eight years later an inline skating marathon was contested.[7][8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNowadays, after leaving Brandenburg Gate, the course passes Charlottenburg, around Tiergarten, along Moabit and Mitte, and then south to Friedrichshain. After that, it winds west between Kreuzberg and Neukölln, through Schöneberg, over to Friedenau and Zehlendorf, before turning north back toward the city's center. Looping above Schöneberg, the course comes full circle as it finishes through the Gate.[11]\n\n\nThere have been two other major international marathons in Berlin. At the 1936 Olympic Games and at the 2009 IAAF World Championships, both using different routes. A marathon in Berlin on 14 Oct 1973 was won by Ulrich Hutmacher (GER) with a time of 2:19:32, but that race is not considered to be part of the Berlin Marathon series.\n\n\n\n## Sponsors[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n15. **^** 2018 Berlin Marathon.

Due to the division of the city, the marathon events before 1990 were limited to West Berlin only. On 30 September 1990 athletes were able to run through the Brandenburg Gate for the first time and since then, the course has covered both halves of the unified city. It was reported that a great many of the runners had tears in their eyes as they ran through the gate.[11]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThere have been several title sponsors in the race's history. From 1974 until 1989 it was just the *Berlin Marathon*. In 1990, it was the *Yanase Berlin Marathon*. In 1991 and 1992 it was the *Canon Berlin Marathon*. It reverted to simply the *Berlin Marathon* from 1993 until 1997. It then became the *Alberto Berlin Marathon* in 1998 and 1999. A new title sponsor changed the name to the *real,- Berlin Marathon* from 2000 to 2010. Since 2011 it has been called the *BMW Berlin Marathon*.\n\n\n\n## Finishers[edit]\n\n\nIn terms of finishing athletes, Berlin is one of four world-wide marathons with more than 40,000 finishers, along with the New York City Marathon, Chicago Marathon, and Paris Marathon.\n\n\n\n![](image)2009 Berlin Marathon\n![](image)World record winner Haile Gebrselassie on his way to his fourth straight victory in the 2009 Berlin Marathon\n![](image)The Berlin Marathon is known as a flat and fast course.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** BERLIN-MARATHON: Zahlen und Rekorde: Die Teilnehmerzahlen 2022\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"47.

The current record was set at the 2022 edition, where Eliud Kipchoge won the men's race in 2:01:09. Tigist Assefa set a new women's world record in 2023 with 2:11:53.

Two years later, one of the race's pacemakers, Simon Biwott won the race, after one of the favourites had pulled out in the second half of the race. In 2001, Naoko Takahashi became the first woman to run a sub-2:20 marathon, completing the Berlin Marathon in 2:19:46. The race had continued to be the venue of world records; between 2003 and 2018, seven men's records were set at the race; the most recent remains as the current world record time; Eliud Kipchoge's 2:01:39.[7][8]\n\n\nThe event was held in mid-September in 2000 and 2018, because of a conflict with the Women's Olympic Marathon, and due to German Unity Day preparations, respectively.[9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section needs to be **updated**.

In the first race, the course took a diversion around Southwark Park before re-joining Jamaica Road on the way to Tower Bridge and was routed through St Katherine Docks past the Tower Hotel, en route to the Tower of London and the cobblestoned stretch of road that in later years was carpeted, to help runners prevent injury on the uneven surface. In 1982, the finishing post was moved from Constitution Hill to Westminster Bridge due to construction works. It remained there for twelve years before moving to its present location at The Mall. In 2005, the route around the Isle of Dogs between 22 and 34 kilometres (14 and 21 mi) was switched from a clockwise to an anti-clockwise direction, and at 35 km (22 miles) the route was diverted to avoid St Katherine Docks and the cobblestoned area near the Tower of London. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 2008, a suspected gas leak at a pub in Wapping diverted the course, but in 2009 the race followed the same path as in 2007.[24][25]\n\n\nSince 2012 mile 21 has become a significant cheer zone with Run Dem Crew transforming the stretch of Commercial Road outside the former Limehouse Town Hall into a street party with music and confetti cannons.[26]\n\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 London Marathon was run on a non-traditional course, consisting of 19.6 laps of length 2.15 kilometres (1.34 mi) around St James's Park, taking in The Mall, Horse Guards Parade, Birdcage Walk and Buckingham Palace.

The race is held on the first Sunday of November and attracts professional competitors and amateurs from all over the world. Because of the popularity of the race, participation is chosen largely by a lottery system. Guaranteed entry to the marathon can be gained by satisfying the requirements of the 9+1 program or the 9+$1K program (where NYRR members run in nine sponsored races and either volunteer at another event or donate $1,000 to support NYRR programs for young athletes), having completed 15 or more previous NYC Marathons, or meeting time qualification standards. In addition, runners can gain an entry by joining a team to raise funds for one of a number of charities.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Paula Radcliffe, the victor of the women's division in the 2007 NYC Marathon.\nSee also: List of winners of the New York City Marathon\n\nThe first New York City Marathon was held 54 years ago on September 13, 1970,[6] organized by Fred Lebow and the then president of New York Road Runners, Vincent Chiappetta,[7][8][*better source needed*] with 127 competitors running several loops around the Park Drive of Central Park. Only about 100 spectators watched Gary Muhrcke win the race in 2:31:38. Only 55 runners crossed the finish line.[9]\n\n\nOver the years, the marathon grew larger and larger.[10] To celebrate the U.S. bicentennial in 1976, city auditor George Spitz proposed that the race traverse all five boroughs. With the support of Manhattan Borough President Percy Sutton, the men convinced Mayor Abraham Beame and, eventually, race director Fred Lebow. The race was a huge success, and what was intended as a one-time celebration became the annual course.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Course of the New York City Marathon 2013; this is similar to the courses used in previous years.\nFrom 1976, the course covers all five boroughs of New York City. It begins on Staten Island, in Fort Wadsworth, near the approach to the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge. The bridge typically carries only vehicular traffic and is closed for the event. Runners use both sides of the bridge's upper level and the westbound side of the lower level. In the opening minutes of the race, the bridge is filled with runners, creating a dramatic spectacle that is closely associated with the event.\n\n\nAfter descending the bridge, the course winds through Brooklyn, mostly along Fourth Avenue and Bedford Avenue, for approximately the next 11 miles (18 km). Runners pass through a variety of neighborhoods, including: Bay Ridge, Sunset Park, Park Slope, Bedford–Stuyvesant, Williamsburg, and Greenpoint.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n64. **^** Futterman, Matthew; Minsberg, Talya (May 17, 2021). \"New York City Marathon Will Return in November\". *The New York Times*.

Games.[3] The winner of the inaugural edition was John J. \"JJ\" McDermott,[4] who ran the 24.5 mile course in 2:55:10, leading a field of 15. The event was scheduled for the recently established holiday of Patriots' Day, with the race linking the Athenian and American struggles for liberty.[8] The race, which became known as the Boston Marathon, has been held in some form every year since then, even during the World War years and the Great Depression, making it the world's oldest annual marathon. In 1924, the starting line was moved from Metcalf's Mill in Ashland to the neighboring town of Hopkinton. The course was lengthened to 26 miles 385 yards (42.195 km) to conform to the standard set by the 1908 Summer Olympics and codified by the IAAF in 1921.[9] The first 1.9 miles (3.1 km) are run in Hopkinton before the runners enter Ashland.[10]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Marathon Dates\". *BAA.org*.

For most of its history, the Boston Marathon was a free event, and the only prize awarded for winning the race was a wreath woven from olive branches.[11] However, corporate-sponsored cash prizes began to be awarded in the 1980s, when professional athletes refused to run the race unless a cash award was available. The first cash prize for winning the marathon was awarded in 1986.[12]\n\n\nWalter A. Brown was the President of the Boston Athletic Association from 1941 to 1964.[13] During the height of the Korean War in 1951, Brown denied Koreans entry into the Boston Marathon. He stated: \"While American soldiers are fighting and dying in Korea, every Korean should be fighting to protect his country instead of training for marathons. As long as the war continues there, we positively will not accept Korean entries for our race on April 19.\"[14]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n8. **^** \"The History of the Boston Marathon: A Perfect Way to Celebrate Patriot's Day\".

Held annually since 1974,[a] the event includes multiple races over the marathon distance of 42.195 kilometres (26.219 mi), including elite level road running competitions for men and women, a race for the public, an inline skating race, a wheelchair race, and a handcycle race.\n\n\nEvents are split over two days, with skaters competing on the marathon course on Saturday before the running events. Power walkers, hand-bikers, wheelchair riders, and a children's marathon (4.2195 kilometres (2.6219 mi), 1/10 of the regular distance)[4] are also part of the marathon weekend, which is organised by SCC EVENTS. The elite running and wheelchair races are part of the World Marathon Majors, an annual series of top level races offering a $1 million prize purse. BMW is the current title sponsor for the race.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNowadays, after leaving Brandenburg Gate, the course passes Charlottenburg, around Tiergarten, along Moabit and Mitte, and then south to Friedrichshain. After that, it winds west between Kreuzberg and Neukölln, through Schöneberg, over to Friedenau and Zehlendorf, before turning north back toward the city's center. Looping above Schöneberg, the course comes full circle as it finishes through the Gate.[11]\n\n\nThere have been two other major international marathons in Berlin. At the 1936 Olympic Games and at the 2009 IAAF World Championships, both using different routes. A marathon in Berlin on 14 Oct 1973 was won by Ulrich Hutmacher (GER) with a time of 2:19:32, but that race is not considered to be part of the Berlin Marathon series.\n\n\n\n## Sponsors[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n15. **^** 2018 Berlin Marathon.

On 30 September 1990 athletes were able to run through the Brandenburg Gate for the first time and since then, the course has covered both halves of the unified city. It was reported that a great many of the runners had tears in their eyes as they ran through the gate.[11]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThere have been several title sponsors in the race's history. From 1974 until 1989 it was just the *Berlin Marathon*. In 1990, it was the *Yanase Berlin Marathon*. In 1991 and 1992 it was the *Canon Berlin Marathon*. It reverted to simply the *Berlin Marathon* from 1993 until 1997. It then became the *Alberto Berlin Marathon* in 1998 and 1999. A new title sponsor changed the name to the *real,- Berlin Marathon* from 2000 to 2010. Since 2011 it has been called the *BMW Berlin Marathon*.\n\n\n\n## Finishers[edit]\n\n\nIn terms of finishing athletes, Berlin is one of four world-wide marathons with more than 40,000 finishers, along with the New York City Marathon, Chicago Marathon, and Paris Marathon.\n\n\n\n![](image)2009 Berlin Marathon\n![](image)World record winner Haile Gebrselassie on his way to his fourth straight victory in the 2009 Berlin Marathon\n![](image)The Berlin Marathon is known as a flat and fast course.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n8. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Countdown is starting: Looking back into the history of the BMW BERLIN MARATHON\".

In 1977, Christa Vahlensieck established a new women's world record at the Berlin Marathon, running 2:34:47. Four years later, the race started outside the Reichstag for the first time, by which time it had grown to 2,583 finishers, making it the largest city road race in Germany. The following year, before German unification, some East Germans secretly ran the race, registering under false names to avoid recriminations from the East German secret service. In 1989, a children's race was added to the event, and eight years later an inline skating marathon was contested.[7][8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** BERLIN-MARATHON: Zahlen und Rekorde: Die Teilnehmerzahlen 2022\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"47.

Beginning with a little over a dozen runners, only seven completed the course.[16] In a stunning upset, a reported 100,000 or more spectators watched Chicagoan Rhud Metzner come from behind to steal a late-race victory from the favored Louis Marks.[14] With that first race, the Chicago Marathon began an annual run of epic races that continued until the early 1920s, eventually on a revised course that largely resembles today's marathon route.[15] The second year, feet bleeding, Canadian Dennis Bennett won, while a band played \"Maple Leaf Forever\". \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAnnual Chicago marathons were held from 1905 to the 1920s, but the first race in the present series occurred on September 25, 1977, under the original name the Mayor Daley Marathon, which drew a field of 4,200 runners. The race has been held every year since, except in 1987 when only a half-marathon was run, and in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.[3][4][5] It became among the fastest-growing modern-marathon road races in the world, due in part to its largely fast and flat course which facilitates the pursuit of personal records and world record performances.[6] The race has achieved its elite status among marathons by developing relationships with sponsors who provide prize money to lure elite runners who have produced American and world record performances. Since 2008, the race has been sponsored and organized by Bank of America, and is officially known as the **Bank of America Chicago Marathon**.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the early years the Chicago Marathon was held in August.[23] It has from its inception with 4,200 runners and 2,128 finishers been one of the nation's largest marathons. The 2000 running was second only to New York.[24] The 1979 and 1980 events, however, continued to be gatherings of amateur runners. By 1982, the race finally had sufficient prize money to attract world class athletes. The 1982 was the first with world class times such as the 2:10:59 by Greg Meyer.[18] By 1983, the Chicago Marathon had achieved its status as one of America's most important marathons. In 1984, Beatrice raised the purse to $250,000 ($50,000 more than New York's).[18] The race had become a legitimate rival to New York and continues to vie for top runners. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Bank of America Chicago Marathon has grown significantly from its beginnings. In 1905, 20 runners registered for the first Chicago Marathon, 15 actually started the race, and 7 finished.[17] For the first \"modern\" marathon race in 1977, 4,200 people took part.[54] In 1995, 9,000 people registered, and in 1999, over 29,000 people registered. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n48. **^** \"Course & Amenities\".

With the help of Lee Flaherty, the event's founder who operated out of Flair House in the Near North Side community area of Chicago,[21] Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley's support for the marathon was enlisted. Although Mayor Daley died, his successor Michael Anthony Bilandic approved the race and got Kelly on board. Michael Bilandic, a runner, and his wife actually passed out medals at the first marathon on September 25, 1977. This first edition of the modern Chicago Marathon was called the Mayor Daley Marathon.[22] Flaherty footed the bill for the first race, which had no sponsors. He again footed the bill in 1978 when the race was again called the Mayor Daley Marathon. In 1979, however, Beatrice Foods became the first race sponsor.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Britt, Raymond, \"Chicago Marathon: Images of Sport\", Arcadia Publishing, 2009, ISBN 978-0-7385-7718-0.\n* Cooper, Pamela, \"The American Marathon\", Syracuse University Press, 1998, ISBN 0-8156-0520-X.\n* Suozzo, Andrew, \"The Chicago Marathon\", University of Illinois Press, 2006, ISBN 0-252-07421-1.\n* Treadwell, Sandy, \"The World of Marathons\", Stewart, Tabori & Chang, 1987, ISBN 0-941434-98-2.\n\n\n## External links[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Chicago Marathon.\n\n* Official website ![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\n* Chicago Marathon Elevation Profile\n* Chicago Marathon Weather History\n* Marathon Info\n* \"Chicago Marathon\". *MarathonGuide.com*.\n* Chicago Marathon at MarathonQuest.com\n* archive at Chicago Tribune\n* Chicago Marathon at *Runner's World*\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe race is limited to 45,000 runners and only runners who finish within 61⁄2 hours are officially timed.[6][7] Those wishing to participate can register after either meeting a time qualifying standard or being selected through a general lottery.[8] Although the race has limited registration, exceptions include elite runners, legacy finishers, and charity representatives.[9] Increasingly, local, national and global charities as well as humanitarian organizations encourage sponsored participation in the event as a means of fund raising.[10][11]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of winners of the Chicago Marathon\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBecause of this only a half-marathon race was held that year[5] and the marathon was moved to the spring of 1988[27] and attracted Heileman Brewing Company to sponsor the 1988 Old Style Chicago Marathon.[28] The race resulted in three women who had been passed over for the 1988 Games of the XXIV Olympiad placing in the top positions.[29] In 1991, Heileman discontinued its sponsorship and both the prize money and performances waned.[30] In 1992, the race again had no sponsorship, but 1993 brought new sponsor LaSalle Bank.[31] In 1994, the race became the LaSalle Bank Chicago Marathon.[32] In 1996, LaSalle Bank purchased the Chicago Marathon from Major Events, Inc., who had purchased the race three years prior from Flaherty.[33][34] In 1998, the race began using transponder timing.[35] In 2001, when Catherine Ndereba broke the women's world record marathon time, both the men's and women's then-current world records had been set at the Chicago Marathon.[36]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAnnual footrace held in Chicago, U.S.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Chicago Marathon |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)Logo for the Chicago Marathon\n |\n| Date | Second Sunday in October (before Columbus Day) |\n| Location | Chicago, Illinois, United States |\n| Event type | Road |\n| Distance | 26.219 miles (42.195 km) |\n| Established | 1977; 47 years ago (1977) |\n| Last held | 2023 |\n| Course records | **M**: 2:00:35 \\**WR*(2023 – Kelvin Kiptum)**F**: 2:13:44(2023 – Sifan Hassan) |\n| Official site | chicagomarathon.com |\n\n\nThe **Chicago Marathon** is a marathon race held every October in Chicago, Illinois. It is one of the six World Marathon Majors.[1] Thus, it is also a World Athletics Label Road Race. The Chicago Marathon is the fourth-largest race by number of finishers worldwide.[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The former logo before the current sponsor\nThe first modern marathon at the 1896 Games of the I Olympiad in Greece generated interest in the sport which led to similar races throughout most western countries and across the United States. While marathons sporadically occurred in New York City and St. Louis,[12] the Boston Marathon had established an annual marathon in 1897, soon to be followed by a Chicago annual race.[13] Beginning in 1905,[14] the Chicago Marathon (organized first by the Illinois Athletic Club 1905 to 1909, then sponsored by the *Chicago Daily News* after 1910) was held annually, with significant community and spectator support, until the early 1920s.[15]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)First Chicago Marathon September 23, 1905. Louis Marks in the lead.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Chicago Marathon has never excluded women. Historically, however, the women's field has been smaller than the men's. This seems to be the result of older age categories having large multiples of men to women, but the women are beginning to outnumber the men in the 20s age group of the field.[63]\n\n\n\n### Records[edit]\n\n\nWorld records have been broken at Chicago six times.[64] In 1984, Steve Jones broke the world record with 2:08:05. In 1999, Khalid Khannouchi was the first to surpass 2:06:00 with 2:05:42. \n\n\nThe men's course record was broken in the 2013 race by Dennis Kimetto with a time of 2:03:45.[65] On October 8, 2023, Kelvin Kiptum set a new world record, and therefore also the Chicago course record, completing the course in 2:00:35.[66]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The founding location of the Chicago Marathon is at 214 West Erie in River North.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIt was not until the health consciousness of the 1960s that marathon growth gained traction in the public's eyes. Frank Shorter's 1972 Games of the XX Olympiad marathon victory represented the convergence of many middle-class American ideals.[18] Then the 1976 New York City Marathon, which was the first New York City Marathon to embrace the five borough course, popularized the big city marathon. As the New York marathon began to grow exponentially in the 1970s, the Chicago Marathon was established as a rival to the New York City Marathon.[3] By the mid-1980s, the Chicago Marathon was ensconced as one of the big four marathons.[19] During the mid-1980s, it was named America's Marathon/Chicago and opened up the way for appearance payments. Joan Benoit Samuelson described the Chicago Marathons of the mid-1980s as \"The World's Marathon\".[20] The Bank of America Chicago Marathon is an open race with no qualifying time to participate.[6]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe 2001 marathon run on October 7 reached its cap of 37,500, which was instituted after the 2000 race drew 33,171 runners,[55] just prior to the entry deadline on September 19.[56] In 2003, 2004, 2005, and 2006 it reached its cap of 40,000.[3][57] The October 10, 2004, October 9, 2005 and October 22, 2006 races reached their 40,000 entrant caps on August 16, July 14, and May 26 respectively.[57][58][59] On April 18, 2007, the 2007 race run on October 7 reached its cap of 45,000 entrants.[60] There was a late registration exemption whereby elite runners (marathon times of less than 2:31/3:01 or half marathon times of 1:11/1:21 for (men/women)) could register until September 1 even though the race had reached its registration cap in the spring.[61] The 40,000 registrants and 33,000 finishers in 2003 made the Chicago Marathon the third or fourth largest marathon depending on which metric (registrants or finishers) is used.[62]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"World Marathon Majors\".

Beginning with a little over a dozen runners, only seven completed the course.[16] In a stunning upset, a reported 100,000 or more spectators watched Chicagoan Rhud Metzner come from behind to steal a late-race victory from the favored Louis Marks.[14] With that first race, the Chicago Marathon began an annual run of epic races that continued until the early 1920s, eventually on a revised course that largely resembles today's marathon route.[15] The second year, feet bleeding, Canadian Dennis Bennett won, while a band played \"Maple Leaf Forever\". \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAnnual Chicago marathons were held from 1905 to the 1920s, but the first race in the present series occurred on September 25, 1977, under the original name the Mayor Daley Marathon, which drew a field of 4,200 runners. The race has been held every year since, except in 1987 when only a half-marathon was run, and in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.[3][4][5] It became among the fastest-growing modern-marathon road races in the world, due in part to its largely fast and flat course which facilitates the pursuit of personal records and world record performances.[6] The race has achieved its elite status among marathons by developing relationships with sponsors who provide prize money to lure elite runners who have produced American and world record performances. Since 2008, the race has been sponsored and organized by Bank of America, and is officially known as the **Bank of America Chicago Marathon**.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the early years the Chicago Marathon was held in August.[23] It has from its inception with 4,200 runners and 2,128 finishers been one of the nation's largest marathons. The 2000 running was second only to New York.[24] The 1979 and 1980 events, however, continued to be gatherings of amateur runners. By 1982, the race finally had sufficient prize money to attract world class athletes. The 1982 was the first with world class times such as the 2:10:59 by Greg Meyer.[18] By 1983, the Chicago Marathon had achieved its status as one of America's most important marathons. In 1984, Beatrice raised the purse to $250,000 ($50,000 more than New York's).[18] The race had become a legitimate rival to New York and continues to vie for top runners. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n48. **^** \"Course & Amenities\".

It is one of the six World Marathon Majors.[1] Thus, it is also a World Athletics Label Road Race. The Chicago Marathon is the fourth-largest race by number of finishers worldwide.[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Bank of America Chicago Marathon has grown significantly from its beginnings. In 1905, 20 runners registered for the first Chicago Marathon, 15 actually started the race, and 7 finished.[17] For the first \"modern\" marathon race in 1977, 4,200 people took part.[54] In 1995, 9,000 people registered, and in 1999, over 29,000 people registered. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe modern era Chicago Marathon was founded over the objection of Ed Kelly, Chicago Park District Superintendent who refused permission to run in the parks or along the Lake Michigan lakefront. With the help of Lee Flaherty, the event's founder who operated out of Flair House in the Near North Side community area of Chicago,[21] Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley's support for the marathon was enlisted. Although Mayor Daley died, his successor Michael Anthony Bilandic approved the race and got Kelly on board. Michael Bilandic, a runner, and his wife actually passed out medals at the first marathon on September 25, 1977. This first edition of the modern Chicago Marathon was called the Mayor Daley Marathon.[22] Flaherty footed the bill for the first race, which had no sponsors. He again footed the bill in 1978 when the race was again called the Mayor Daley Marathon. In 1979, however, Beatrice Foods became the first race sponsor.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The founding location of the Chicago Marathon is at 214 West Erie in River North.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe race is limited to 45,000 runners and only runners who finish within 61⁄2 hours are officially timed.[6][7] Those wishing to participate can register after either meeting a time qualifying standard or being selected through a general lottery.[8] Although the race has limited registration, exceptions include elite runners, legacy finishers, and charity representatives.[9] Increasingly, local, national and global charities as well as humanitarian organizations encourage sponsored participation in the event as a means of fund raising.[10][11]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of winners of the Chicago Marathon\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSimilar hot conditions have been experienced in other city center races. In 2003, London's The British 10K also had extremely hot weather that affected many runners.[42][43]\n\n\nThe 2020 edition of the race was cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic, with all registrants given the option of either transferring their entry to 2021, 2022, or 2023, or obtaining a full refund.[44][45]\n\n\n\n\n## Course[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Chicago Marathon start/finish in Grant Park, October 2006\nThe marathon course is a loop course, starting and ending at Grant Park. From there, the current course winds through 29 of the city's neighborhoods.[46] The course loop can be generally divided into three sections: North, West, and South. In each of these sections, three of the city's main stadiums are near the course's turning points: Wrigley Field to the north; the United Center to the west; and Guaranteed Rate Field to the south. The city's fourth professional stadium, Soldier Field, is located near the start/finish area.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBecause of this only a half-marathon race was held that year[5] and the marathon was moved to the spring of 1988[27] and attracted Heileman Brewing Company to sponsor the 1988 Old Style Chicago Marathon.[28] The race resulted in three women who had been passed over for the 1988 Games of the XXIV Olympiad placing in the top positions.[29] In 1991, Heileman discontinued its sponsorship and both the prize money and performances waned.[30] In 1992, the race again had no sponsorship, but 1993 brought new sponsor LaSalle Bank.[31] In 1994, the race became the LaSalle Bank Chicago Marathon.[32] In 1996, LaSalle Bank purchased the Chicago Marathon from Major Events, Inc., who had purchased the race three years prior from Flaherty.[33][34] In 1998, the race began using transponder timing.[35] In 2001, when Catherine Ndereba broke the women's world record marathon time, both the men's and women's then-current world records had been set at the Chicago Marathon.[36]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The former logo before the current sponsor\nThe first modern marathon at the 1896 Games of the I Olympiad in Greece generated interest in the sport which led to similar races throughout most western countries and across the United States. While marathons sporadically occurred in New York City and St. Louis,[12] the Boston Marathon had established an annual marathon in 1897, soon to be followed by a Chicago annual race.[13] Beginning in 1905,[14] the Chicago Marathon (organized first by the Illinois Athletic Club 1905 to 1909, then sponsored by the *Chicago Daily News* after 1910) was held annually, with significant community and spectator support, until the early 1920s.[15]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"World Marathon Majors\".
