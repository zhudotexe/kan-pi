It is officially known as the NFL Annual Player Selection Meeting. The draft was held April 23–24, 2005. The league also held a supplemental draft that year, which was held after the regular draft but before the regular season. The draft took place at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York City,[1][2] and was televised for the 26th consecutive year on ESPN and ESPN2. It was the first to be held at the Javits Center after Madison Square Garden was utilized for previous drafts since 1995.[3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | **120** | Washington Redskins | Manuel White | FB | UCLA | Pac-10 | from Minnesota[R4 - 6]\n |\n|  | 4\n | **121** | Carolina Panthers | Stefan LeFors | QB | Louisville | C-USA | from Seattle[R4 - 7]\n |\n|  | 4\n | **122** | Buffalo Bills | Duke Preston | C | Illinois | Big Ten |  |\n|  | 4\n | **123** | New York Jets | Kerry Rhodes | S | Louisville | C-USA | from Jacksonville[R4 - 8]\n |\n|  | 4\n | **124** | Baltimore Ravens | Jason Brown | C | North Carolina | ACC |  |\n|  | 4\n | **125** | Green Bay Packers | Brady Poppinga | LB | BYU | MWC |  |\n|  | 4\n | **126** | Philadelphia Eagles | Todd Herremans | OT | Saginaw Valley State | GLIAC | from Denver via Cleveland, Seattle, Carolina and Green Bay[16]\n |\n|  | 4\n | **127** | Jacksonville Jaguars | Alvin Pearman | RB | Virginia | ACC | from New York Jets[R4 - 9]\n |\n|  | 4\n | **128** | Atlanta Falcons | Chauncey Davis | DE | Florida State | ACC |  |\n|  | 4\n | **129** | Indianapolis Colts | Dylan Gandy | OG | Texas Tech | Big 12 |  |\n|  | 4\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe draft is best known for quarterback Aaron Rodgers falling to the 24th selection after being projected as one of the top picks.[4] Although Rodgers believed he would be taken first overall by the San Francisco 49ers, the 49ers selected quarterback Alex Smith and Rodgers was passed on by teams with other positional needs until he was drafted by the Green Bay Packers.[5][6][7] Rodgers' fall drew retrospective scrutiny due to developing a reputation as one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time.[8][9][10][11]\n\n\nCompensatory selections were distributed amongst fourteen teams, with the Philadelphia Eagles and the St. Louis Rams garnering the most with four picks each.[12] Three of the first five picks were running backs, an NFL draft first.[13]\n\n\nThe 255 players chosen in the draft were composed of:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_5TDFubIC6VP3FLLVIy7tj1cW","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

After this poor showing in his first game, he didn't play a snap the second game of the season against the St. Louis Rams.

He was drafted by the Carolina Panthers in the second round of the 2005 NFL Draft. He played college football at Louisville.\n\n\nShelton has also been a member of the Washington Redskins.\n\n\n\n\n## Early years[edit]\n\n\nShelton attended Bryan Station High School in Lexington, Kentucky, where he played both running back and linebacker and twice earned state Class 4A Player of the Year honors. He totaled 4,970 yards rushing with 59 touchdowns and 129 tackles with 11 sacks and 41 stops for losses during his career. Shelton was a First-team USA Today and Parade All-American and was also an All-State track performer who competed in the high hurdles, triple jump and 4x100 relay. It was in high school that he met his future wife Shamea. He was on Tom Lemming's Top 100 highschool recruits, ranked at #6 in the nation [1]\n\n\n\n## College career[edit]\n\n\n### Florida State[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nShelton was drafted in the second round (54th overall) of the 2005 NFL Draft by the Carolina Panthers with a pick they obtained from the Seattle Seahawks.[4] Shelton's NFL career got off to a rough start as he was placed on injured reserve at the beginning of the 2005 NFL season due to a broken foot. In the 2006 season, Shelton rushed for 23 yards on only eight carries, and was activated in only eight games. After a disappointing career with the Panthers he was released by them on September 1, 2007.\n\n\n\n### Washington Redskins[edit]\n\n\nOn January 9, 2008, the Washington Redskins signed Shelton to a future contract. He was waived/injured with a neck injury on July 30 and subsequently placed on injured reserve. He was released with an injury settlement on August 15.\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nShelton started his collegiate career at Florida State University, where he played one season as a true freshman for the Seminoles. He finished fourth on the team with 29 carries for 130 yards (4.5 avg.) but was disappointed with his playing time and decided to transfer to Louisville. As a result of NCAA transfer rules, however, he was forced to sit out the 2002 season.\n\n\n\n### Louisville[edit]\n\n\nShelton attended the University of Louisville, and in his junior year (in 2004) he led the Cardinals in rushing (938 yards) and touchdowns (20). His touchdown total tied the single season Louisville touchdown record (since broken by Michael Bush with 23 in 2005) and he also tied a Louisville record by rushing for five touchdowns in a game versus East Carolina University. He ranked sixth in the nation with 120 points. In 22 games with the Cardinals, he totaled 1,728 yards on 312 carries (5.5 avg) and had 30 touchdown runs. His 30 touchdowns rank third all time at Louisville despite his only playing two years there.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAmerican football player (born 1983)\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerican football player\n\n\n\nEric Shelton| No. 32 |\n| --- |\n| Position: | Running back |\n| Personal information |\n| Born: |  (1983-06-23) June 23, 1983 (age 40)Lexington, Kentucky, U.S. |\n| Height: | 6 ft 1 in (1.85 m) |\n| Weight: | 246 lb (112 kg) |\n| Career information |\n| High school: | Lexington (KY) Bryan Station |\n| College: | Louisville |\n| NFL draft: | 2005 / Round: 2 / Pick: 54 |\n| Career history\n  |\n| * Carolina Panthers (2005–2006)\n* Washington Redskins (2008)\\*\n |\n|  \\* Offseason and/or practice squad member only |\n|  |\n| Career highlights and awards\n  |\n| * Second-team All-Conference USA (2004)\n |\n|  |\n| Career NFL statistics |\n| \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Rushing attempts: | 8 |\n| Rushing yards: | 23 |\n| Rushing touchdowns: | 0 |\n| Receptions: | 1 |\n| Receiving yards: | 6 |\n| Receiving touchdowns: | 0 |\n\n |\n|  |\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_GvH8SbFnm1k9XgQeQPcNTKb7","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

Javits Convention Center in New York City,[1][2] and was televised for the 26th consecutive year on ESPN and ESPN2. It was the first to be held at the Javits Center after Madison Square Garden was utilized for previous drafts since 1995.[3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n70th annual meeting of National Football League franchises to select newly eligible players\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| 2005 NFL Draft |\n| --- |\n| ![2005 NFL draft logo](image) |\n| General information |\n| Date(s) | April 23–24, 2005 |\n| Time | 12:00 pm EDT (April 23)11:00 am EDT (April 24) |\n| Location | Jacob K.

He played college football for the California Golden Bears, earning consensus All-American recognition. Arrington was selected by the Arizona Cardinals in the second round of the 2005 NFL Draft. He also played for the Denver Broncos and had a brief stint with the Philadelphia Eagles and Las Vegas Locomotives of the United Football League (UFL). He also was the last player to get the Pop Warner Award.\n\n\n\n\n## Early years[edit]\n\n\nArrington was born in Nashville, North Carolina. He attended Northern Nash High School and was a letterman in football as a tailback. In football, he was a three-year varsity starter and a two-time All-Conference selection. He was also named his team's Most Valuable Player and the Area Offensive Player of the Year as a senior.\n\n\n\n## College career[edit]\n\n\nArrington was sent to College of the Canyons by East Carolina University with the intent that he would play for the Pirates in two years. As a sophomore at College of the Canyons, he won All-Region III honors (which is selected by the California Community College Football Coaches Association and the Junior College Athletic Bureau) and had 135 rushing attempts for 769 yards (5.7 yards per rushing attempt average), and caught 30 passes for 320 yards (10.67 yards per reception average). His 19 touchdowns that season, and 29 career touchdowns, were both school records.\n\n\nArrington transferred to the University of California, Berkeley as a junior, and played for the California Golden Bears football team in 2003 and 2004. Arrington would receive few carries for most of the 2003 season aside from his 114-yard performance against Southern Mississippi. A knee injury to then starting running back Adimchinobi Echemandu would thrust Arrington into the starting role against the Washington Huskies. This proved to be his breakout game as he mauled the Huskies defense for 185 yards and a touchdown. It took him only 14 carries to achieve this feat. In the first half managed to tally 157 yards on ten carries. He also caught a 30-yard touchdown pass from Aaron Rodgers giving him a total of 215 yards on the day.\n\n\nDespite his performance, he would receive limited carries for the rest of the 2003 season. He did play a pivotal role in the Insight Bowl by catching five passes for 38 yards, including a 13-yard touchdown pass that would reduce Virginia Tech's lead to only 28–21 at halftime. Cal would ultimately prevail 52–49 on a game-winning field goal.\n\n\nThe 2004 season would see Arrington earn the starting tailback spot after the departure of Echemandu for the NFL. Arrington played a major role in the Cal Bears' first 10-win season since 1949. He would rush for at least 100 yards in every single game that season. Arrington rushed for 169 yards or more in eight of his team's 12 games as well.\n\n\nUltimately Arrington would have one of the greatest seasons of any running back in NCAA and Pac-10 history, gaining 2,018 rushing yards that season. He became only the third Pac-10 Tailback to gain over 2,000 yards, joining USC tailbacks Marcus Allen and Charles White. His mark is also the tenth best total in NCAA history. He would receive the honor of the Pop Warner Award, deeming him the best College Football player on the west coast. He would also earn All-American and All-Pacific-10 conference honors.\n\n\nUltimately, the season would end in disappointment. Despite a 10–1 record, the Bears were bypassed for a BCS Bowl bid by The University of Texas. As a result, they played in the Pacific Life Holiday Bowl against a 7-4 Texas Tech squad, where Cal was defeated by a score of 45–31, to end Arrington's college career.\n\n\nIn addition, Arrington was not invited to the Heisman Trophy ceremony (a distinction afforded the top three to five likely winners) despite having a better statistical year (15 TDs, 2,018 yards rushing, 6.98 yards per carry) than the number 2 vote-getter, Adrian Peterson (15 TDs, 1,925 yards rushing, 5.68 yards per carry).\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n\n\nPre-draft measurables\n| Height | Weight | Arm length | Hand span | 40-yard dash | 10-yard split | 20-yard split | 20-yard shuttle | Three-cone drill | Vertical jump | Broad jump | Bench press |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 5 ft 8+7⁄8 in(1.75 m)\n | 214 lb(97 kg)\n | 30+1⁄2 in(0.77 m)\n | 8+3⁄4 in(0.22 m) | 4.46 s | 1.54 s | 2.57 s | 4.10 s | 6.81 s | 35.0 in(0.89 m) | 10 ft 1 in(3.07 m) | 18 reps |\n| All values from NFL Combine[1][2] |\n\n\n### Arizona Cardinals[edit]\n\n\nAfter drafting him in the second round of the 2005 NFL Draft,[3] the Cardinals placed him as the starting running back on the depth chart, with the intention of having him share carries with Marcel Shipp. He started the first game against the New York Giants gaining 5 yards on 8 carries (0.625 average). After this poor showing in his first game, he didn't play a snap the second game of the season against the St. Louis Rams. By the end of the season, he had played 15 games with 5 starts, gaining 370 yards on 112 carries (3.3 average) and 2 touchdowns. That following offseason the Cardinals signed Edgerrin James.\n\n\nThe Cardinals' drafting of Tim Hightower in 2008 resulted in Arrington being shifted to third place on the depth chart at running back. He became the team's principal kick returner and in Super Bowl XLIII caught 2 passes for 35 yards.\n\n\n\n### Denver Broncos[edit]\n\n\nArrington signed with the Denver Broncos on March 4, 2009. He was released on May 27, 2009, after failing his physical.[4] It was determined that Arrington would need season-ending microfracture surgery on his right knee,[5] following surgery to the same knee in February. He was re-signed on March 4, 2010.\n\n\n\n### Philadelphia Eagles[edit]\n\n\nArrington was traded to the Philadelphia Eagles in exchange for linebacker Joe Mays on July 30, 2010.[6] He was waived on September 3. Due to Arrington being released prior to the start of the season, the Eagles received a 2012 sixth-round draft pick from the Broncos.[7]\n\n\n\n### Las Vegas Locomotives[edit]\n\n\nBefore the 2011 season, Arrington signed with the Las Vegas Locomotives of the United Football League.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of college football yearly rushing leaders\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"2005 Draft Scout J.J.

The team had already lost running back Danny Woodhead for the season[12] due to an ankle injury suffered on September 21, 2014, in a game against the Buffalo Bills.[13] The team was also without running back Ryan Mathews who suffered an MCL sprain on September 21 in a game against the Seattle Seahawks and was expected to be out 4–5 weeks.[14] Ronnie Brown played in seven games for the Chargers in the 2014 season. On December 20, 2014 (Week 16), in a game at San Francisco, he played an important role in a 38–35 overtime victory instrumental in keeping San Diego's playoff hopes alive. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAlthough he started only 21 of 47 games for Auburn he finished his career ranked seventh in school history with 2,707 yards rushing on 513 carries while ranking fifth with 28 rushing touchdowns. Brown also had 58 receptions for 668 yards and two touchdowns.\n\n\nIn 2020, Brown was inducted into the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame.[1]\n\n\n\n### Stats[edit]\n\n\n* 2000: 6 carries for 10 yards and no touchdowns.\n* 2001: 84 carries for 330 yards (3.93) and 2 touchdowns. 7 catches for 109 yards.\n* 2002: 175 carries for 1008 yards (5.76) and 13 touchdowns. 9 catches for 166 yards and 1 touchdown.\n* 2003: 95 carries for 446 yards (4.69) and 5 touchdowns. 8 catches for 80 yards.\n* 2004: 153 carries for 913 yards (5.97) and 8 touchdowns. 34 catches for 313 yards and 1 touchdown.\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBrown ended up having only about forty more rushes than Williams during the 2005 season, and was well on pace for a 1,000 yard campaign if it wasn't for them sharing the football. Brown ended up with 207 rushes for 907 yards (4.4 avg.) and 4 touchdowns while having 32 receptions for 232 yards and a touchdown.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWith Ricky Williams suspended for the entire season, Brown entered 2006 as the feature back for the Miami Dolphins. The offensive line and offense in general struggled for the Dolphins, making it difficult for Brown to consistently produce at a high level. He had a breakout game on October 15 loss to the New York Jets, rushing for 127 yards and a touchdown on 22 carries. Three weeks later he rushed for a career-high 157 yards against a stingy Chicago Bears defense, helping the Dolphins to an upset victory of the previously undefeated Bears. On a Thanksgiving Day game against the Detroit Lions, Brown suffered a broken left hand from a hit by a defender's helmet. While he missed the next three contests, Brown returned for the final two games of the season and posted back-to-back 100-yard rushing performances against the Indianapolis Colts and New York Jets. In 13 games played, Brown finished with 1,008 rushing yards, 276 receiving yards, five touchdowns and a solid 4.2 average.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Eagles traded Brown to the Detroit Lions in exchange for running back Jerome Harrison and a seventh-round draft pick in 2013 on October 18, 2011,[8] but the trade was voided the next day after Harrison failed his physical with the Eagles.\n\n\n\n### San Diego Chargers[edit]\n\n\nBrown signed a one-year contract with the San Diego Chargers on June 8, 2012.[9]\nAfter an injury to starting running back Ryan Mathews in the preseason, Brown started the season opener against the Oakland Raiders on Monday Night Football. While he was ineffective on the ground, gaining just 5 yards on five carries, Brown became the third-down back for the Chargers. On January 5, 2014, Brown sealed a 27–10 win for the Chargers with a 58-yard touchdown run in the wild card playoff game against the Cincinnati Bengals.\n\n\n\n### Houston Texans[edit]\n\n\nThe Houston Texans signed Brown on August 11, 2014.[10] He was released on October 1, 2014.[11]\n\n\n\n### San Diego Chargers (second stint)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn overtime, Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers handed off the ball to Brown on six straight plays, as the team moved 22 yards to set up Nick Novak's game-winning fieldgoal.[15] The next week, in the regular-season finale, he didn't record a single carry, as the Chargers lost to the Kansas City Chiefs and didn't make the playoffs. At the end of the season, the San Diego Chargers organization didn't offer him a contract extension.\n\n\n\n## NFL career statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_DS3YhFeiQ93d0RJFDrxbJoej","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
