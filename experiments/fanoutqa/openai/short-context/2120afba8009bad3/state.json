The film's premiere was extensively covered by media and was widely anticipated because of the large cultural following the *Star Wars* saga had cultivated. Upon its release, *The Phantom Menace* received mixed reviews from critics. While the visual effects were praised, its exposition and characters\u2014particularly Jar Jar Binks\u2014received criticism. The movie was a box-office success and broke numerous box-office records during its debut. It grossed more than $924.3 million worldwide during its initial theatrical run, becoming the highest-grossing film of 1999, the second-highest-grossing film worldwide and in North America (behind *Titanic*), and the highest-grossing *Star Wars* film at the time (inflation notwithstanding). A 3D reissue, which earned an additional $102.7 million and brought the film's overall worldwide takings to over $1 billion, was released in February 2012. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n210. ^ ***a*** ***b*** McClintock, Pamela (February 23, 2012). \"'Star Wars: Phantom Menace' Crosses $1 Billion Mark at Box Office\". *The Hollywood Reporter*.

During the hiatus, the backstories he created for the characters, particularly Anakin's own backstory, sparked interest in him to develop a prequel trilogy during the 1990s. After he determined that computer-generated imagery (CGI) had advanced to the level he wanted for the prequel trilogy's visual effects, Lucas began writing *The Phantom Menace* in 1993, and production began in 1994. Filming started on June 26, 1997\u2014at locations including Leavesden Film Studios and the Tunisian desert\u2014and ended on September 30. The film marked Lucas' first directorial effort after a 22-year hiatus following the original *Star Wars*[b] in 1977.\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Though a box office success, it was nevertheless overshadowed by the even greater box office success of *The Phantom Menace* three years earlier.[2] It was not the top-grossing film of the year, either in North America (where it finished in third place) or worldwide (where it was fourth), the first time that a *Star Wars* film did not have this distinction. In North America, it was outgrossed by *Spider-Man* and *The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers*, both of which were more favorably received by critics. Worldwide, it was also outgrossed by *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets*. Adjusted for inflation, *Attack of the Clones* is the lowest-performing live-action *Star Wars* film at the North American box office, though is still among the 100 highest-grossing films of all time when adjusted for inflation. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe film was released in the United States on May 16, 2002. It received mixed reviews from critics; the film's increased focus on action was praised, while the characters and dialogue were regarded more critically. It performed well at the box office, making $653.8 million worldwide.

The films would be re-released in chronological order beginning with *The Phantom Menace* on February 10, 2012. *Revenge of the Sith* was originally scheduled to be re-released in 3D on October 11, 2013.[76][i] However, on January 28, 2013, Lucasfilm announced that it was postponing the 3D release of episodes *II* and *III* in order to \"focus 100 percent of our efforts on *Star Wars: The Force Awakens*\" and that further information about 3D release plans would be issued at a later date.[78][79][80] The premiere of the 3D version was shown on April 17, 2015, at Star Wars Celebration Anaheim.[81]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nInternational grosses that exceeded $460 million include those Australia ($27.2 million), France and Algeria ($56.9 million), Germany ($47.3 million), Italy ($11.3 million), Japan ($82.7 million), Mexico ($15.3 million), South Korea ($10.3 million), Spain ($23.8 million), and the United Kingdom and Ireland ($72.8 million).[110] The total worldwide opening of *Revenge of the Sith* for each country was $254 million, combined with $304 million from its four-day weekend. It would go on to hold this record for two years before *Spider-Man 3* took it in 2007.[111]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\nFollowing the release of *Revenge of the Sith*\u2014the completion of the original and prequel *Star Wars* series\u2014on June 9, 2005, George Lucas was presented with the 33rd American Film Institute Lifetime Achievement Award.

It broke several box office records during its opening week and went on to earn $868.4 million worldwide, making it the second-highest-grossing film in the *Star Wars* franchise at the time. It was the highest-grossing film in the U.S. and the second-highest-grossing film worldwide in 2005.

O. Scott of *The New York Times* concluded that it was \"the best of the four episodes Mr. Lucas has directed\", and equal to *The Empire Strikes Back* as \"the richest and most challenging movie in the cycle\".[86] J.R. Jones, a *Chicago Reader* critic who disliked *The Phantom Menace* and *Attack of the Clones*, gave the film a positive review, saying that it had a \"relatively thoughtful story\".[87] Roger Ebert of the *Chicago Sun-Times* gave the film three-and-a-half out of four stars, writing \"If [Lucas] got bogged down in solemnity and theory in *Episode II: Attack of the Clones*, the Force is in a jollier mood this time, and *Revenge of the Sith* is a great entertainment\", but he noted that \"the dialogue throughout the movie is once again its weakest point\".[88]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| *Episode I* | * *The Phantom Menace* (1999)\n* *Racer* (1999)\n* *Racer Arcade* (2000)\n* *Jedi Power Battles* (2000)\n* *Battle for Naboo* (2000)\n* *Obi-Wan's Adventures* (2000)\n* *Starfighter* (2001)\n* *Obi-Wan* (2001)\n* *Racer Revenge* (2002)\n |\n| *Episode II* | * *The Clone Wars* (2002)\n* *Attack of the Clones* (2002)\n* *The New Droid Army* (2002)\n |\n| *Episode III* | * *Revenge of the Sith* (2005)\n |\n| *Clone Wars* | * *Jedi Alliance* (2008)\n* *Lightsaber Duels* (2008)\n* *Republic Heroes* (2009)\n* *Clone Wars Adventures* (2010)\n* *Lego Star Wars III: The Clone Wars* (2011)\n |\n| Other | * *Pit Droids* (1999)\n* *Lego Star Wars: The Video Game* (2005)\n |\n\n |\n| Other | * Clone Wars\n* Clone troopers\n* *Episode I* (pinball)\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n*Star Wars*\n |\n| --- |\n| Films | \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Skywalker Saga | \n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
