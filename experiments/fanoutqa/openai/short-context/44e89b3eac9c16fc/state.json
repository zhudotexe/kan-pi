Dark and Steel types fare well against \"Psychic\" attacks, which was a dominant type in *Red* and *Blue*. The concept of breeding was introduced in the second generation of *Pok\u00e9mon* games as well, which allows players to manipulate the skills of their Pok\u00e9mon to a greater degree.[1] Some of the new Pok\u00e9mon introduced in *Gold* and *Silver* are pre-evolutions of other Pok\u00e9mon, such as Pichu and Igglybuff. These baby Pok\u00e9mon are only available by breeding their evolved forms.\n\n\n*Pok\u00e9mon Gold* and *Silver* were first revealed at Nintendo Space World in 1997. At this point, the game had a massively larger world map than the final game and this prototype featured around 40 Pok\u00e9mon designs that were removed and replaced when the games were released in 1999.[2]\n\n\n\n\n## List of Pok\u00e9mon[edit]\n\n\nPok\u00e9mon\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nList of Pok\u00e9mon species introduced in its second generation\n\n![](image)The international logo for the *Pok\u00e9mon* franchise\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| \nList of Pok\u00e9mon by generation |\n| * Generation I\n* Generation II\n* Generation III\n* Generation IV\n* Generation V\n* Generation VI\n* Generation VII\n* Generation VIII\n* Generation IX\n |\n| \nRelated:\u00a0List of Pok\u00e9mon |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe second generation (Generation\u00a0II) of the *Pok\u00e9mon* franchise features 100\u00a0fictional species of creatures introduced to the core video game series in the 1999 Game Boy Color games *Pok\u00e9mon Gold* and *Silver*, set in the Johto region. Some Pok\u00e9mon in this generation were introduced in animated adaptations of the franchise before *Gold* and *Silver*, such as Ho-Oh in the first episode of the *Pok\u00e9mon* anime series in 1998 and 1999, Togepi, which was a recurring character in the anime owned by Misty, Donphan in the Pok\u00e9mon first movie in 1998, Snubbull in the first Pikachu short movie in 1998, and Marill, which also debuted in that short film and was a recurring character in the anime owned by Tracey Sketchit in 1998 and 1999.

It tends to run across the land, and it is said that somehow the northern winds will blow as it appears. It is always in search of a pure reservoir. Ho-Oh resurrected it after it perished as a helpless unknown animal in a burning tower. Some say that it is a Water type because it symbolizes the rain that put out the fire in the building. It is the main legendary of Pok\u00e9mon Crystal.

Then it falls asleep to evolve. After it emerges, it does not do well with the bright light it finds on the surface. Ash once had to take care of a lost baby Larvitar in the last couple of Johto anime episodes.\n |\n| Pupitar\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nStating that \"it was too late, we couldn't suddenly change Lugia into a female\", the change was so significant to him that it made him start \"gulping down alcohol and drugs\" and \"feel like [he] wanted to die\".

These games were accompanied by the television series Pok\u00e9mon Advanced, which aired from November 1, 2002, until August 28, 2003 in Japan.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe following list details the 135\u00a0Pok\u00e9mon of Generation\u00a0III in order of their National Pok\u00e9dex number.
