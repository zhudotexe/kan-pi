He previously played for the team in the 1970s.\nOn May 20, 2010, TNT analyst Doug Collins was named head coach of the 76ers.[45] Collins played for the Sixers for his entire NBA career after being the first overall pick in the 1973 draft, and had previously coached the Chicago Bulls, Detroit Pistons, and the Washington Wizards. The 76ers had the sixth-best odds at receiving the top pick in the 2010 draft, and they managed to land the second overall pick, beating out the Warriors, Kings, Timberwolves, and Nets, who all had better odds. They used that draft pick to select Ohio State University's Evan Turner.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Philadelphia 76ers |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) *2023\u201324 Philadelphia 76ers season* |\n| ![Philadelphia 76ers logo](image) |\n| Conference | Eastern |\n| Division | Atlantic |\n| Founded | 1946 |\n| History | **Syracuse Nationals**1946\u20131949 (NBL)1949\u20131963 (NBA)**Philadelphia 76ers**1963\u2013present[1][2][3] |\n| Arena | Wells Fargo Center |\n| Location | Philadelphia, Pennsylvania |\n| Team colors | Blue, red, silver, navy, white[4][5][6]\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 |\n| Main sponsor | Crypto.com[7] |\n| CEO | Tad Brown |\n| President | Daryl Morey |\n| General manager | Elton Brand |\n| Head coach | Nick Nurse |\n| Ownership | Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment (Josh Harris and David Blitzer)[a] |\n| Affiliation(s) | Delaware Blue Coats |\n| Championships | **3** (1955, 1967, 1983) |\n| Conference titles | **5** (1977, 1980, 1982, 1983, 2001) |\n| Division titles | **12** (1950, 1952, 1955, 1966, 1967, 1968, 1977, 1978, 1983, 1990, 2001, 2021) |\n| Retired numbers | **10** (2, 3, 4, 6, 10, 13, 15, 24, 32, 34) |\n| Website | www.nba.com/sixers |\n|  |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nPhiladelphia 76ers\n |\n| --- |\n| * Founded in **1946**\n* Formerly the **Syracuse Nationals** (1946\u20131963)\n* Based in **Philadelphia, Pennsylvania**\n |\n| Franchise | * History\n* All-time roster\n* Draft history\n* Head coaches\n* Seasons\n* **Current season**\n |\n| Arenas | * State Fair Coliseum\n* Onondaga County War Memorial\n* Convention Hall\n* Philadelphia Arena\n* Spectrum\n* **Wells Fargo Center**\n* 76 Place at Market East *(proposed)*\n |\n| Personnel | Owner(s)\nJosh Harris and David Blitzer (Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment)\nPresident\nDaryl Morey\nGeneral manager\nElton Brand\nHead coach\nNick Nurse\n |\n| G League affiliate | * Delaware Blue Coats\n |\n| Retired numbers | * 2\n* 3\n* 4\n* 6\n* 10\n* 13\n* 15\n* 24\n* 32\n* 34\n* MIC\n |\n| NBA championships | * 1955\n* 1967\n* 1983\n |\n| Rivalries | * Boston Celtics\n |\n| Culture and lore | * Allen Iverson\n\t+ Career achievements\n* \"Fo', fo', fo'\"\n* Wilt the Stilt\n* Dr. J\n* The Boston Strangler\n* Dave Zinkoff\n* \"Havlicek stole the ball\"\n* Curse of Billy Penn\n* Hip Hop\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe **Philadelphia 76ers**, colloquially known as the **Sixers**, are an American professional basketball team based in the Philadelphia metropolitan area.[b] The 76ers compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference.

They have won three NBA championships, with their first coming under their previous name, the Syracuse Nationals, in 1955. The second title came in 1967, a team which was led by Chamberlain. The third title came in 1983, won by a team led by Erving and Malone. The 76ers have only been back to the NBA Finals once since then: in 2001, where they were led by Iverson and lost to the Los Angeles Lakers in five games.

The regular season finished with the 76ers in the sixth seed, a notable decrease in position from the previous two seasons. In the first round of the playoffs, the 76ers were eliminated by the Celtics in a 4\u20130 sweep.

He stayed with the team as an adviser.[53] Soon after, general manager DiLeo had \"cut ties\" with the team. On May 11, it was announced that Sam Hinkie, who had previously worked for the Houston Rockets, would replace DiLeo as general manager.[54] On July 8, it was announced that Adam Aron had stepped down as CEO and was being replaced by Scott O'Neil.\n\n\n\n#### 2013\u20132016: \"The Process\"[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWith new ownership, Iverson in place, and the 76ers moving into the CoreStates Center, things seemed to finally be heading in a positive direction. Croce fired Lucas as both coach and general manager. Johnny Davis was named head coach, while Brad Greenberg took over as general manager. Iverson was named Rookie of the Year, but Philadelphia's overall improvement was minimal, as they finished with a 22\u201360 record. Changes had to be made, and after the 1996\u201397 season, Davis and Greenberg were both fired and the unveiling of a new 76ers team logo and jerseys marked a new era. To replace Davis, Larry Brown was hired as head coach. Known for a defense-first approach and transforming unsuccessful teams into winners by \"playing the right way\", Brown faced perhaps his toughest coaching challenge. He often clashed with Iverson, but the 76ers improved to 31 wins in 1997\u201398. Early in the 1997\u201398 season, the Sixers traded Jerry Stackhouse, who had been the third overall pick in the 1995 NBA draft, to the Detroit Pistons. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n117. **^** \"Nike Earned Edition Jersey: Philadelphia 76ers\". *NBA.com*.

On March 13, 2009, Batum recorded a season-high 20 points to go along with a clutch three-pointer with 29.9 seconds left, en route to a 109\u2013100 victory over the New Jersey Nets.[11]\n\n\nBatum missed the first 45 games of the 2009\u201310 season due to torn cartilage in his right shoulder. He played in his first game of the season on January 25, 2010.[12]\n\n\nBatum scored more than 30 points for the first time with a 31-point performance (including 7 rebounds, 7 assists, and 3 steals) on February 27, 2010 against the Minnesota Timberwolves.[13]\n\n\n\n### SLUC Nancy (2011)[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2011, during the 2011 NBA lockout, he signed a one-year contract with SLUC Nancy in French Basketball League which was valid until the NBA lockout ended.[14]\n\n\n\n### Return to Portland (2011\u20132015)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe chase-down block thus became a fundamental part of Batum's game and was a skill brought with him to the NBA. Through March 2013, only two players in the 2012\u201313 season who did not play center or power forward had performed more blocks than Batum \u2014 Josh Smith and Kevin Durant.[48]\n\n\nOn May 31, 2021, Batum started for Los Angeles Clippers as a center of the lineup against Dallas Mavericks in game four of the 2021 NBA playoffs.[49]\n\n\n\n## National team career[edit]\n\n\n### 2012 Summer Olympics[edit]\n\n\nBatum played for the senior men's French national basketball team at the 2012 Summer Olympics. Late in a 66\u201359 quarterfinal loss to Spain, a frustrated Batum punched Spanish player Juan Carlos Navarro in the groin. After the game, Batum said, \"I wanted to give him a good reason to flop.\" Batum later apologized on Twitter, writing, \"I showed a bad image of France and myself. and the city of Portland Oregon. Congrats to team Spain.\"[50]\n\n\n\n### 2014 FIBA World Cup[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Batum (pictured here in 2007) began his professional career in France.\nWhile playing for Le Mans, Batum averaged 3.4 points (65.9% FG), 2.5 rebounds, 0.5 assist per game in 13 minutes for the 2006\u20132007 French league season,[9] and 12.3 points (52.3%), 5.0 rebounds and 3.6 assists per game in 28 minutes for the 2007\u20132008 season.[10]\n\n\n\n### Portland Trail Blazers (2008\u20132011)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Batum with the Portland Trail Blazers in 2011.\nUpon being selected with the 25th pick in the 2008 NBA draft by the Houston Rockets, Batum was traded to the Portland Trail Blazers for the rights to Darrell Arthur and Joey Dorsey.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n48. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** Joe Freeman, \"A Lifelong Fondness for Rejection: Nicolas Batum's Signature Chase-Down Block Has Its Roots in his Youthful Appreciation of an All-Star's Prowess,\" *The Oregonian,* March 27, 2013, pp. D1, D4.\n49. **^** \"Stars carry Clippers at Mavs again, 106-81 rout evens series\". *ESPN.com*.

He played in the 2017 McDonald's All American Game and the Nike Hoop Summit.[9][10]\n\n\nBamba was rated as a five-star recruit and was ranked among the top recruits in his class.[11][12] His final four schools were Kentucky, Duke, Texas and Michigan.[13][14][15][16] Ultimately, Bamba chose to play for the University of Texas for his college career. Before playing a single game for Texas, his half-brother Ibrahim Johnson posted a 22-minute-long video on Facebook Live, talking about how there were some illegal benefits from a Michigan-based investor involved during the decision-making and that he was reporting the information to the NCAA.[17] However, the NCAA reported that nothing involved there would ultimately affect Bamba's eligibility for his freshman season.[18]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n6. **^** \"Farmingdale State Athletics\". *Farmingdale State Athletics*.
