Fraser was appointed to succeed Corbat, becoming the first female CEO of a top-tier Wall Street Investment Bank,[21][22] leading the third-largest bank in the U.S.[3]\nFraser has taken an approach to work during the COVID-19 pandemic that differs from peer CEOs, instituting permanent plans to allow staff to work from home some days of the week, and granting staff greater flexibility in their schedules than other Wall Street firms.[23] She has cited differentiating Citigroup from other bulge bracket banks such as Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase during recruiting as a motivation for this approach.[23]\n\n\nFraser is scheduled to speak at the November 2022 Global Financial Leaders' Investment Summit, with the Hong Kong Democracy Council claiming that her presence, along with other financial executives, legitimizes the Hong Kong government's whitewashing of the erosion of freedoms in the city.[24]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nShe wrote articles on globalization and was a co-author, with three other McKinsey employees, of the 1999 book *Race for the World: Strategies to Build a Great Global Firm*.[8][10] As part of her research for the book, she traveled to China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Singapore, and India to interview McKinsey clients about their global challenges.[9] After hearing her speak about the book, Citigroup executive Michael Klein spent several years encouraging Fraser to make the move to Citigroup, which she eventually did in 2004.[11]\n\n\n\n## Citigroup[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFraser was hired as Head of Client Strategy in Citigroup's investment and global banking division in July 2004.[5][11] In October 2007 she was promoted to Global Head of Strategy and Mergers and Acquisitions, a position she held until May 2009.[9] Her tenure as Global Head coincided with the financial crisis of 2007\u20132009, and she was part of the executive team that was \"charged with restructuring the group, leading its re-engineering effort, making divestments and raising new capital\".[5]\n\n\n\n![](image)A Citi Private Bank office\nIn June 2009 she was named CEO of Citi Private Bank.[11] At the time of her promotion, the bank was running an annual deficit of approximately $250 million; it returned to the black during her four-year tenure.[12] Among the changes she implemented were a decrease in the ratio of private bankers to clients, with a target of one banker for every 30 clients, and the removal of commissions and sales formulas for bankers in favor of a year-end discretionary bonus.[5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n## Memberships[edit]\n\n\nFraser is Vice Chair for Partnership for New York City and a member of the Harvard Business School\u2019s Board of Dean\u2019s Advisors, the Stanford Global Advisory Board, the Economic Club of New York and the Council on Foreign Relations.[20] Fraser has led the Citi Operations team since 2021.[25][26][27] She was also a member of the board of the Touch Foundation from 2006 to 2015.[6]\n\n\n\n## Honours and recognition[edit]\n\n\nIn 2015 Fraser was ranked number 41 on *Fortune*'s list of the 51 Most Powerful Women in Business,[15] up from number 48 on the 2014 list.[28] *American Banker* named her the \"Number 1 Woman to Watch\" both in 2014[12] and 2015.[16]\n\n\nFraser was selected for the inaugural 2021 Forbes 50 Over 50; made up of entrepreneurs, leaders, scientists and creators who are over the age of 50.[29]\n\n\n\n## Personal[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn October 2019, Fraser was appointed President of Citigroup and Head of Global Consumer Banking (GCB), and was responsible for all of Citi\u2019s Consumer businesses, including Retail Banking and Wealth Management, Credit Cards, Mortgage and Operations and Technology in 19 markets.[19][20]\n\n\n\n### Promotion to CEO and tenure[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLess than a year later, in March 2014, Fraser was promoted to CEO of US Consumer and Commercial Banking, succeeding Cecelia Stewart who announced her retirement.[14] And in April 2015 she was named CEO of Citigroup Latin America,[15] with responsibility for operations in 24 countries.[16] The latter promotion followed a reshuffling of Citigroup executives sparked by the retirement of Manuel Medina-Mora, CEO of Citigroup's global consumer bank.[17] Medina-Mora was replaced by Stephen Bird, former CEO for the Asia-Pacific region, who in turn was replaced by Francisco Aristeguieta, former CEO of Citigroup Latin America.[18] While based in Miami,[17][18] Fraser has been tasked with, among other things, \"instilling a more U.S.-like culture\" at Banamex (Banco Nacional de M\u00e9xico), owned and operated by Citigroup since 2001.[16] The bank was fined $2.2 million on fraud charges in 2014.[18] The head of Banamex, Ernesto Torres Cantu, reports directly to Fraser.[17][18]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n35. **^** \"Hearing Before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs\". *Citigroup*.

Tom\u00e9 was born Carol Louise Buchenroth on January 8, 1957 in Jackson, Wyoming.[7] Tom\u00e9's family emphasized the value of hard work and capability in her upbringing, which Tom\u00e9 characterizes as \"an unbelievable childhood\". She learned to hunt, fish, cook, sew, and live off the land. Her father was a community banker. Tom\u00e9 took an early interest in finance, and envisioned herself following a similar path and working in banking after her graduation from business school at The University of Denver.[8]\n\n\nTom\u00e9 worked as a commercial lender at United Bank of Denver (now, Wells Fargo),[9] was director of banking at Johns-Manville Corporation, and was vice president and treasurer of Riverwood International Corporation of Atlanta (now part of Graphic Packaging), a global paperboard, packaging, and packaging machinery firm.[10][11] She joined The Home Depot in 1995 when they sought an experienced executive for an expansion into Mexico.[12] She was promoted to CFO in 2001. During her time at the company, The Home Depot grew from 400 stores to 2,200 with revenue of nearly $100 billion. Its share price over her tenure increased more than 450%.[5] She has received praise for The Home Depot's performance after its emergence from the 2008-09 financial and housing crisis.[13] After a brief retirement, she was announced Chief Executive Officer Elect of UPS, where she had been a member of the board of directors since 2003.[14] In 2020 she became Chief Executive Officer of UPS.[15][16]\n\n\nTom\u00e9 has been a member of the board of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and served as chairman of that board, a member of The Committee of 200, the Atlanta Botanical Garden board of directors, The Business Council, the Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce as chairman of the board, the Grady Memorial Hospital as a board trustee, the International Business Council of the World Economic Forum, and the Verizon Communications board of directors.[9][16]\n\n\n\n## Recognition[edit]\n\n\nTom\u00e9 has been named twice to the *Forbes* list of The World's 100 Most Powerful Women as #16 and #12.[17] In 2012, Tom\u00e9 was listed second on *The Wall Street Journal*'s list of best chief financial officers,[18] and among the top 50 most powerful women in business by *Fortune* magazine.[16][9]\n\n\nTom\u00e9 was selected for the inaugural 2021 *Forbes* 50 Over 50; made up of entrepreneurs, leaders, scientists and creators who are over the age of 50.[19]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Carol B Tom\u00e9\". *littlesis.org*.

The concept of the *Fortune* 500 was created by Edgar P. Smith, a *Fortune* editor, and the first list was published in 1955.[2][3] The *Fortune* 500 is more commonly used than its subset *Fortune* 100 or superset *Fortune* 1000.[4]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nThe *Fortune* 500, created by Edgar P. Smith, was first published in 1955.[2] The original top ten companies were General Motors, Jersey Standard, U.S. Steel, General Electric, Esmark, Chrysler, Armour, Gulf Oil, Mobil, and DuPont.[5]\n\n\n\n## Methodology[edit]\n\n\nThe original *Fortune* 500 was limited to companies whose revenues were derived from manufacturing, mining, and energy exploration. At the same time, *Fortune* published companion \"*Fortune* 50\" lists of the 50 largest commercial banks (ranked by assets), utilities (ranked by assets), life insurance companies (ranked by assets), retailers (ranked by gross revenues) and transportation companies (ranked by revenues). *Fortune* magazine changed its methodology in 1994 to include service companies. With the change came 291 new entrants to the famous list including three in the Top 10.[6] There is a lag in creating the list, so for example, the 2019 *Fortune* 500 is based on each company's financial years ending in late 2018 (most commonly, on December 31), or early 2019.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Influence[edit]\n\n\nAs of 2020, the *Fortune* 500 companies represent approximately two-thirds of the United States' gross domestic product with approximately $14.2 trillion in revenue, $1.2 trillion in profits, and $20.4 trillion in total market value. These revenue figures also account for approximately 18% of the gross world product. The companies collectively employ a total of 29.2 million people worldwide, or nearly 0.4% of the world's total population.[7]\n\n\n\n## Overview[edit]\n\n\nThe following is the list of top 20 companies.[8]\n\n\n\n\n\n*Fortune* 500 list of 2022\n| Rank\n | Company\n | State\n | Industry\n | Revenue in USD\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | Walmart | ![](image)\u00a0Arkansas | General merchandisers\n | $572.8 billion\n |\n| 2\n | Amazon | ![](image)\u00a0Washington | Internet service and retailing\n | $469.8 billion\n |\n| 3\n | Apple | ![](image)\u00a0California | Technology\n | $365.8 billion\n |\n| 4\n | CVS Health | ![](image)\u00a0Rhode Island | Health care: pharmacy and other services\n | $292.1 billion\n |\n| 5\n | UnitedHealth Group | ![](image)\u00a0Minnesota | Health care: insurance and managed care\n | $287.6 billion\n |\n| 6\n | ExxonMobil | ![](image)\u00a0Texas | Petroleum refining\n | $285.6 billion\n |\n| 7\n | Berkshire Hathaway | ![](image)\u00a0Nebraska | Insurance: property and casualty (stock)\n | $276.1 billion\n |\n| 8\n | Alphabet | ![](image)\u00a0California | Internet services and retailing\n | $257.6 billion\n |\n| 9\n | Chevron Corporation | ![](image)\u00a0California | Energy, oil and gas\n | $246.3 billion\n |\n| 10\n | McKesson | ![](image)\u00a0Texas | Wholesalers: health care\n | $238.2 billion\n |\n| 11\n | Costco | ![](image)\u00a0Washington | Wholesalers\n | $226.95 billion\n |\n| 12\n | AmerisourceBergen | ![](image)\u00a0Pennsylvania | Wholesalers: health care\n | $214.0 billion\n |\n| 13\n | Microsoft | ![](image)\u00a0Washington | Technology\n | $198.3 billion\n |\n| 14\n | Cardinal Health | ![](image)\u00a0Ohio | Healthcare\n | $181.364 billion\n |\n| 15\n | Cigna | ![](image)\u00a0Connecticut | Managed care, insurance\n | $180.62 billion\n |\n| 16\n | Marathon Petroleum | ![](image)\u00a0Ohio | Petroleum\n | $179.95 billion\n |\n| 17\n | The Home Depot | ![](image)\u00a0Georgia | Retail\n | $157.4 billion\n |\n| 18\n | Elevance Health | ![](image)\u00a0Indiana | Insurance\n | $156.6 billion\n |\n| 19\n | Walgreens Boots Alliance | ![](image)\u00a0Illinois | Pharmacy, retail\n | $132.7 billion\n |\n| 20\n | AT&T | ![](image)\u00a0Texas | Telecommunications, technology\n | $120.74 billion\n |\n\n\n### Breakdown by state[edit]\n\n\nThis is the list of the top 18 states with the most companies within the Fortune 500.[9]\n\n\n\n\n\nBreakdown by state\n| Rank\n | State\n | Companies\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | ![](image)\u00a0California | 53\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0New York | 53\n |\n| 3\n | ![](image)\u00a0Texas | 49\n |\n| 4\n | ![](image)\u00a0Illinois | 28\n |\n| 5\n | ![](image)\u00a0Ohio | 25\n |\n| 6\n | ![](image)\u00a0Pennsylvania | 24\n |\n| 7\n | ![](image)\u00a0Virginia | 22\n |\n| 8\n | ![](image)\u00a0Florida | 20\n |\n| 9\n | ![](image)\u00a0Georgia | 19\n |\n| 10\n | ![](image)\u00a0Massachusetts | 18\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Minnesota | 18\n |\n| 12\n | ![](image)\u00a0Michigan | 17\n |\n| 13\n | ![](image)\u00a0New Jersey | 16\n |\n| 14\n | ![](image)\u00a0Connecticut | 14\n |\n| 15\n | ![](image)\u00a0North Carolina | 12\n |\n| 16\n | ![](image)\u00a0Colorado | 10\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Missouri | 10\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Tennessee | 10\n |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)United States portal\n* ![](image)Companies portal\n\n\n* 40 under 40 (Fortune Magazine)\n* *Fortune* Global 500\n* *Fortune* India 500\n* *Fortune* 1000\n* List of largest companies in the United States by revenue\n* List of largest companies by revenue\n* List of Fortune 500 computer software and information companies\n* List of women CEOs of *Fortune* 500 companies\n* *Forbes* Global 2000\n* Total *Fortune* 1000 companies by urban area list\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Fortune 500\". *Fortune*.

On June 3, 2011, the *Atlanta Business Chronicle* stated examples of *Fortune* including regional headquarters for some cities, excluding regional headquarters for other cities and in some cases excluding headquarters that are physically located inside a city limit.[1]\n\n\n\n## Geographical distribution[edit]\n\n\nSince 2001, there has been significant change in the geographical distribution of the companies in the Global 500 rankings. Most of this growth is accounted for by a rapid increase in the number of Chinese Global 500 companies, of which there were 135 by 2021, increasing from only 10 in 2001. The share of European-based companies also declined, from 158 to 143, over the same period.[2][3][4]\n\n\n\n## *Fortune* Global 500 list of 2023[edit]\n\n\nThe following is the list of top 10 companies in 2023.[5]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAnnual ranking of corporations\n\n\nThe ***Fortune* Global 500**, also known as **Global 500**, is an annual ranking of the top 500 corporations worldwide as measured by revenue. The list is compiled and published annually by *Fortune* magazine.\n\n\n\n\n## Methodology[edit]\n\n\nUntil 1989, it listed only non\u2013United States industrial corporations under the title \"International 500\" while the *Fortune* 500 contained and still contains exclusively United States corporations. In 1990, United States companies were added to compile a truly global list of top industrial corporations as ranked by sales. Since 1995, the list has had its current form, listing also top financial corporations and service providers by revenue.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* 40 Under 40\n* Fortune India 500\n* Forbes Global 2000\n* Fortune 500\n* Fortune 1000\n* List of largest companies by revenue\n* List of largest employers\n* List of public corporations by market capitalization\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs of August\u00a02021[update], this is the list of the top 10 countries with the highest revenues top 500 companies.[8]\n\n\n\n\n\nBreakdown by country\n| Rank\n | Country\n | Companies\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | ![](image)\u00a0China | 135\n |\n| 2\n | ![](image)\u00a0United States | 122\n |\n| 3\n | ![](image)\u00a0Japan | 53\n |\n| 4\n | ![](image)\u00a0France | 28\n |\n| 5\n | ![](image)\u00a0Germany | 27\n |\n| 6\n | ![](image)\u00a0United Kingdom | 22\n |\n| 7\n | ![](image)\u00a0South Korea | 15\n |\n| 8\n | ![](image)\u00a0\u00a0Switzerland | 13\n |\n| 9\n | ![](image)\u00a0Canada | 12\n |\n| 10\n | ![](image)\u00a0Netherlands | 11\n |\n\n\n### Breakdown by region[edit]\n\n\nAs of August\u00a02021[update], just 21 (4%) of the Fortune Global 500 companies are located outside East Asia, North America, and Europe.[8]\n\n\n\n\n\nBreakdown by region\n| Region\n | Companies\n | Global share\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| East Asia | 211\n | 42%\n |\n| North America | 136\n | 27%\n |\n| Europe | 132\n | 26%\n |\n| Rest of world | 21\n | 4%\n |\n\n\n## *Fortune* Global 500 list of 2020[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n*Fortune* Global 500 list of 2023\n| Rank\n | Company\n | Country\n | Industry\n | Revenue in USD\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | Walmart | ![](image)\u00a0United States | Retail\n | $611.3 billion\n |\n| 2\n | Saudi Aramco | ![](image)\u00a0Saudi Arabia | Energy\n | $603.7 billion\n |\n| 3\n | State Grid | ![](image)\u00a0China | Energy\n | $530.0 billion\n |\n| 4\n | Amazon | ![](image)\u00a0United States | Internet services and retailing\n | $514.0 billion\n |\n| 5\n | China National Petroleum | ![](image)\u00a0China | Petroleum\n | $483.1 billion\n |\n| 6\n | Sinopec Group | ![](image)\u00a0China | Petroleum\n | $471.2 billion\n |\n| 7\n | ExxonMobil | ![](image)\u00a0United States | Petroleum\n | $413.7 billion\n |\n| 8\n | Apple | ![](image)\u00a0United States | Technology\n | $394.3 billion\n |\n| 9\n | Shell | ![](image)\u00a0United Kingdom | Petroleum\n | $386.2 billion\n |\n| 10\n | UnitedHealth Group | ![](image)\u00a0United States | Health care\n | $324.2 billion\n |\n\n\n### Breakdown by country[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Hotels, Restaurants & Leisure | Compass Group | ![United Kingdom](image) Chertsey | 0469#469 | 32,564\n |\n| Household Products | Procter & Gamble | ![United States](image) Cincinnati | 0154#154 | 80,187\n |\n| Industrials | Hengli Group | ![China](image) Suzhou | 0123#123 | 90,944\n |\n| Materials | China Baowu Steel Group | ![China](image) Shanghai | 0044#44 | 161,698\n |\n| Media | Walt Disney | ![United States](image) Burbank | 0145#145 | 82,722\n |\n| Motor Vehicles & Parts | Volkswagen | ![Germany](image) Wolfsburg | 0015#15 | 293,685\n |\n| Retailing | Walmart | ![United States](image) Bentonville | 0001#1 | 611,289\n |\n| Technology | Apple | ![United States](image) Cupertino | 0008#8 | 394,328\n |\n| Telecommunications | China Mobile Communications | ![China](image) Beijing | 0062#62 | 139,597\n |\n| Transportation | China Post Group | ![China](image) Beijing | 0086#86 | 110,271\n |\n| Wholesalers | Trafigura Group | ![Singapore](image) Singapore | 0012#12 | 318,476\n |\n\n\n## *Fortune* Global 500 list of 2022[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe following is the list of top 10 companies in 2022.[7]\n\n\n\n\n\n*Fortune* Global 500 list of 2022\n| Rank\n | Company\n | Country\n | Industry\n | Revenue in USD\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | Walmart | ![](image)\u00a0United States | Retail\n | $572.8 billion\n |\n| 2\n | Amazon | ![](image)\u00a0United States | Internet Services and Retailing\n | $469.8 billion\n |\n| 3\n | State Grid | ![](image)\u00a0China | Energy\n | $460.6 billion\n |\n| 4\n | China National Petroleum | ![](image)\u00a0China | Petroleum\n | $411.7 billion\n |\n| 5\n | Sinopec Group | ![](image)\u00a0China | Petroleum\n | $401.3 billion\n |\n| 6\n | Saudi Aramco | ![](image)\u00a0Saudi Arabia | Energy\n | $400.4 billion\n |\n| 7\n | Apple | ![](image)\u00a0United States | Technology\n | $365.8 billion\n |\n| 8\n | Volkswagen | ![](image)\u00a0Germany | Automobiles\n | $295.8 billion\n |\n| 9\n | China State Construction Engineering | ![](image)\u00a0China | Construction & Engineering\n | $293.7 billion\n |\n| 10\n | CVS Health | ![](image)\u00a0United States | Health care\n | $292.1 billion\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Lynch** (n\u00e9e\u00a0Rohan, born December 30, 1963) is an American businesswoman and the president and chief executive officer of CVS Health. Lynch serves on the board of directors of AHIP, CVS Health, and U.S. Bancorp. In 2015, she became the first female president of Aetna. She has held executive positions at Magellan Health Services and Cigna. In 2021, she became the highest-ranking female chief executive on the Fortune 500 list.[1]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nLynch was born on December 30, 1963, in Ware, Massachusetts.[2] She attended Ware Junior/Senior High School and graduated in 1980.[3] Lynch attended Carroll School of Management at Boston College, where she received a bachelor\u2019s degree in Accounting and has a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) certification.[4] Upon graduating, she started her financial career in the Boston office of Ernst & Young, where she specialized in insurance.[5][4]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nLynch credits her chosen career path in health care to her family life experiences.[5] She spent nearly a decade in insurance before returning to graduate school to pursue her MBA, saying, \"I wanted to broaden my financial background to have more exposure to the business aspects of running a company\".[4] In 2004, Lynch was appointed president of Cigna Dental.[6] The following year, she was named to a newly-created position that combines leadership of Cigna Group Insurance and Cigna Dental.[7] She left Cigna in 2009 to become president of Magellan Health Services.[8][9]\n\n\nLynch stayed with Magellan until 2012, when she joined Aetna as executive vice president and head of Specialty Products.[10] Three months after joining Aetna, Lynch led the integration of Coventry Health Care, which was the largest health care acquisition at the time.[11] In 2015, Lynch became Aetna's first female president, a role she retained through the $70 billion acquisition of Aetna by CVS Health in 2018.[12][13]\n\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Lynch took the helm as president and chief executive officer of CVS Health on February 1, 2021, following the retirement of Larry Merlo. The appointment made her the highest-ranking female CEO on the Fortune 500 list and the 40th female chief executive on the Fortune 500 list.[14][15] Under Lynch's leadership, CVS Health administered the COVID-19 vaccine in more than 40,000 long-term care facilities and in CVS Pharmacy locations in 50 states, Puerto Rico and Washington, D.C.[16]\n\n\n\n## Awards and honors[edit]\n\n\nLynch was selected for the inaugural 2021 Forbes 50 Over 50, a list of female entrepreneurs, leaders, scientists, and creators who are over the age of 50.[15] She was awarded the 2021 Committee for Economic Development Distinguished Leadership Award, which recognizes business leaders for their contributions.[17][18] She was also ranked number one on Fortune\u2019s Most Powerful Women in Business list.[1] Additionally, Lynch is a board member of U.S. Bancorp,[19] AHIP,[20] The Business Council,[21] Boston College Women\u2019s Council,[8] The Business Roundtable,[22] and is an advisory board member of IBM Watson Health.[8] Lynch is also a trustee of the Bushnell Center for the Performing Arts.[19]\n\n\nLynch was awarded an honorary Doctor of Commercial Science from the University of Hartford in 2022 and an honorary doctorate of humane letters from Becker College in 2015.[23]\n\n\nShe served as honorary co-chair of the Komen Connecticut Race for the Cure benefiting breast cancer research.[24][11] In 2022, she was listed on the Fortune's \u201c50 Most Powerful Women in Business.[25] Lynch was later named to Time's Time 100 annual list of the hundred most influential people in the world in 2023.[26]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nLynch was raised by a single mother. Her mother died by suicide when Lynch was 12 years old.[5] Following her mother\u2019s death, Lynch and her three siblings were raised by their aunt, who was a single mother with a son of her own.[27][28] In Lynch\u2019s early 20s, she lost her aunt to breast cancer, lung cancer, and emphysema.[8]\n\n\nLynch is married to Kevin M. Lynch, the founder, president and CEO of the Quell Foundation, a non-profit organization whose mission is to remove the stigma around mental health, reduce the number of suicides, overdoses, and the incarceration of those with mental illness.[8][29]\n\n\nIn an interview given by Lynch in 2020 she said \u201cOutside of work, I make time for physical fitness, and running is one of my favorite past times. Running helps me to unwind and clear my mind\u2014many times my greatest ideas come from an exhilarating run.\u201d[30]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"CVS Health CEO Karen Lynch is the most powerful woman in American business\". *Fortune*.

She is the first openly gay female CEO of an American *Fortune* 500 company.\n\n\n\n\n## Biography[edit]\n\n\nFord was born in Sioux City, Iowa, the fifth in a family of eight children, and attended Catholic schools through high school.[1][2] Her father was a truck driver and a used car salesman. Ford claims that her mother \"has been the most significant role model to me in my life of an incredibly resilient woman\".[3] Ford's mother was left in an orphanage when she was five by her parents, with her brother, eventually adopted at age ten. Her mother demonstrated to her children how to overcome hardship and later trained as a nurse and ending up being a minister.[4] And in between she was a psychologist, a therapist mother was a nurse before completing her master's degree and becoming a psychologist .[5][2] She started working in the agriculture business at age 12, making $2 an hour de-tasseling corn[6][7] and worked a number of jobs to support her college education, including as a janitor, house painter, and convenience store cashier.[2]\n\n\nFord completed her undergraduate degree at Iowa State University, where she pursued her interests in marketing, finance and operations and was initiated into Alpha Gamma Delta.[8] Her first job was with Mobil Oil Company when she was in her 20s on the tanker, the marketing and refining side.[5] She then worked in supply-chain management at ExxonMobil, Pepsi, and Scholastic, among other companies.[8][7]\n\n\nFord joined Land O'Lakes in 2011,[9] being named as chief supply chain and operations officer. She continued at the company, eventually being promoted to COO, and in August 2018 was appointed as president/CEO by an all-male board.[9][10] At the time Ford became CEO, she was one of 25 women leading *Fortune* 500 companies.[8] She is the ninth person to hold this position.[9] She became the first openly-gay female CEO of a *Fortune* 500 company, a fact remarked upon by several sources.[11][6] As CEO, Ford has invested heavily in Land O'Lakes implementation of new technologies in agriculture as well as the vibrancy of rural communities.[1]\n\n\nFord has stated that the biggest challenges facing American farmers is policy uncertainty, weather and the changing climate, and a lack of broadband access.[7] In Ford's view, the key to preserving American agriculture relies upon innovation, technology, and political stability.[7] Ford has been an advocate for getting high-speed Internet access to rural and underserved areas, calling on the government to provide funds to close the 'digital divide' that is impacting employment, education, and progress.[12] She has also called on major companies and organizations to join the American Connection Project, an effort started by Land O'Lakes to advocate for three main principles: robust federal funding for broadband infrastructure, improved broadband connectivity mapping and better coordination of federal and state agencies to deploy funding.[13][14]\n\n\nFord sits on the board of directors of the Business Roundtable, US Global Leadership Coalition, Paccar, and the Columbia University Deming Center as well as Iowa State University College of Business.[9][15] In 2021, Ford was elected to the BlackRock, Inc., board of directors.[16]\n\n\nIn August 2019, Ford was one of 181 leading CEOs in the United States to sign Business Roundtable's new Statement on the Purpose of a Corporation.[17] The new statement include that companies should serve not only their shareholders, but also deliver value to their customers, invest in employees, deal fairly with suppliers, and support the communities in which they operate.[18] Ford is quoted as saying the new statement matches the history of Land O'Lakes as a farmer-owned cooperative.[18]\n\n\nIn February 2020, the Land O'Lakes company removed the Native American woman as its logo on its butter and cheese products.[5] Ford is quoted as saying the removal of the \"butter maiden\" to the words \"farmer owned\" was more about what the farmer-owned co-op wanted to communicate rather than what it didn't, that the change did not come from pressure placed on the company.[19] She stated that the new images of fields, lakes, and farmers on their packaging represent Land O\u2019 Lakes is a cooperative, owned not by public market shareholders but by the farmers who make its butter, animal feed and more.[2]\n\n\nIn a 2022 interview, Ford shared her experience on what has shaped her to become a CEO. Ford gave advice on how she pays attention to her physical health that which gives her mental clarity. She practices gratitude to her family and her support team. Ford emphasises two traits that she sees are essential in business; humility and authenticity.[20] In 2018 Ford was named in Fortune's Most Powerful Women in Business list.[21] Ford was named to the *Fortune* Most Powerful Women List in 2020 for the third year in a row.[22] Ford was also named to the 2021 and 2022 *Fast Company* Queer 50 list.[23][24]\n\n\nFord sits on the Board of Directors for Starbucks Corporation.[25][26]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nFord is married to Jill Schurtz, the CEO of the St. Paul's Teachers' Retirement Fund Association. They have three teenage children.[27]\n\n\n\n## Works[edit]\n\n\n* \"Land O'Lakes CEO: Farmers Are in Crisis\u2014and America Isn't Paying Attention\", op-ed in *Dairy Business*, June 13, 2019.\n* \"Land O\u2019Lakes CEO Beth Ford and other LGBTQ business leaders talk about the hard work that led to Supreme Court success\", op-ed in *Fortune,* June 18, 2020.\n* \"Land O'Lakes CEO: How businesses can help America's struggling farmers\", op-ed for *CNN Business,* October 12, 2020.\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Land O'Lakes CEO Beth Ford and the changing landscape of America's farms\".
