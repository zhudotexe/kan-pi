She was the first black woman and first mother to lead the organization.[15][4] In February 2022, Butler joined the board of directors of Vision to Learn.[16][17]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Senate[edit]\n\n\n### Appointment[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Butler sworn in by Vice President Kamala Harris in the Old Senate Chamber in 2023\nIn February 2023, incumbent U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein announced she would not run for a sixth full term in the Senate in 2024. On September 29, 2023, she died at the age of 90. At the time of Feinstein's death, several prominent candidates had already announced campaigns for her seat, including U.S. Representatives Barbara Lee, Katie Porter, and Adam Schiff. California Governor Gavin Newsom had previously pledged to nominate a black woman to the office.[18]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| U.S. Senate |\n| --- |\n| Preceded\u00a0byDianne Feinstein\n |  **U.S. Senator (Class 1) from California** 2023\u2013present Served alongside: **Alex Padilla** | **Incumbent** |\n| U.S. order of precedence (ceremonial)\n |\n| Preceded\u00a0byPete Ricketts\n***as United States Senator from Nebraska*** |  **Order of precedence of the United States*as United States Senator from California***  | Succeeded\u00a0by*Governors of States*\n |\n| Preceded\u00a0byPete Ricketts\n |  **United States senators by seniority** 100th\n | **Last**  |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn October 1, 2023, Newsom chose Butler to fill the Senate seat left vacant by Feinstein's death, fulfilling his pledge to appoint a black woman.[19][20] Butler was selected despite not being a resident of California, as she had moved to Maryland in 2021.[21] The United States Constitution requires only that senators be \"inhabitants\" of the state they represent.[21] Newsom's office said that Butler would re-register to vote in California before taking office as a senator.[22] Shortly before nominating Butler, Newsom announced that his nominee would be free to run in 2024 if they chose,[23] a departure from his previous position.[24] On October 19, 2023, Butler announced she would not seek election to a full term in 2024.[25]\n\n\nButler became the first openly LGBT member of the U.S. Senate from California and its first black LGBT member, and was sworn in on October 3, 2023.[26][27]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

The first was Rebecca Latimer Felton, also the first female U.S. Senator, who served a symbolic one-day term in 1922.[34] The appointment was valid until the runoff election scheduled for January 5, because no candidate in the November 2020 election received a majority of the vote.[2]\n\n\n\n### Tenure and political positions[edit]\n\n\nLoeffler called herself the most conservative Republican in the Senate[35][36] and allied herself with President Trump.[35][37] During her tenure in the Senate, Loeffler sponsored 57 bills and cosponsored 210.[38] She voted in line with President Trump's stated position 80% of the time.[39][3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n46. **^** O'Connor, Emma (December 2, 2020). \"A Georgia Republican Senator Donated Her Salary To Anti-LGBTQ And Anti-Abortion Organizations\". *Buzzfeed News*.

Only once before have two female senators representing the same state at the same time been of different parties (in New Hampshire from 2011 to 2017).[67] McSally was the first senator ever appointed to serve alongside someone to whom she initially lost an election, and the first to serve alongside a colleague she lost to in the election immediately preceding the inauguration.[68] McSally and Sinema were the second pair of senators to serve together after having campaigned against each other the year before; the first such instance occurred in 1996\u20131997 in Oregon, when Democrat Ron Wyden defeated Republican Gordon H. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| 2000 | * Doris Holloway Abels\n |\n| 2001 | * Prudence Crandall\n* Doris Duke\n* Mary Elizabeth Sharpe\n* Harriet Ware\n |\n| 2002 | * Elizabeth Buffum Chace\n* Leona McElroy Kelly\n* Mary Francis Xavier Warde\n* Catharine R.

The death of Dianne Feinstein on September 29, 2023, brought the number back down to 24. The seating of Feinstein's replacement, appointed senator Laphonza Butler, on October 3 returned the figure to 25.\n\n\nAs of January 2023, four states (Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, and Washington) are represented by two female U.S. senators. Eleven incumbent women in the Senate are former U.S. representatives: Senators Stabenow, Cantwell, Gillibrand, Baldwin, Hirono, Moore Capito, Duckworth, Sinema, Rosen, Blackburn, and Lummis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSixty women have served in the United States Senate since its establishment in 1789.[17] Cumulatively, 36 female U.S. senators have been Democrats, while 23 have been Republicans and one is an independent. As of 2023, no female U.S. senator has ever won election to the House after her Senate term, resigned from a state governorship for the purpose of a Senate appointment by her successor, also won election as an independent or to represent more than one state in non-consecutive elections, served both seats of a state at different times, or represented a third party in her career. In December 2022, Senator Kyrsten Sinema became the first female senator to switch her party affiliation while in office. In September 2023, Senator Dianne Feinstein became the first female senator to die in office.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSome female U.S. senators have later run for U.S. president or vice president\u2014see list of female United States presidential and vice presidential candidates. In 2020, Kamala Harris became the first female senator, current or past, to win her vice presidential election bid and become the first female President of the United States Senate in American history.\n\n\n\n## Election, selection, and family[edit]\n\n\nBefore 2001, a plurality of women joined the U.S. Senate through appointment following the death or resignation of a husband or father who previously held the seat. An example is Muriel Humphrey (D-MN), the widow of former senator and Vice President Hubert Humphrey; she was appointed to fill his seat until a special election was held (in which she did not run). However, with the election of three women in 2000, the balance shifted; more women have now entered service as a senator by winning elections than by being appointed.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe first time two female senators from the same state served concurrently was beginning in 1993; Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer (both D-CA) were both elected in 1992, with Feinstein taking office that same year (as the result of a special election) and Boxer taking office in 1993; Boxer served until 2016, when she retired, and Feinstein was joined by Kamala Harris. In June 1993, Kay Bailey Hutchison won a special election in Texas, and joined Kassebaum as a fellow female Republican senator. These additions significantly diminished the popular perception of the Senate as an exclusive \"boys' club\". Since 1992, there has been at least one new woman elected to the Senate every two years, with the exception of 2004 (Lisa Murkowski was elected for the first time in 2004, but had been appointed to the seat since 2002). \n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nClinton joined the Senate in 2001, becoming the first female senator from New York, and served until 2009, when she resigned to become the 67th United States Secretary of State, under President Barack Obama. She was replaced by Kirsten Gillibrand, who has been elected three times and was herself a candidate for president in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries.\n\n\nIn 2008, Kay Hagan became the first woman to unseat a female incumbent, Elizabeth Dole. Upon the opening of the 112th United States Congress in 2011, New Hampshire Democrat Jeanne Shaheen was joined by newly elected Republican Kelly Ayotte, making up the first Senate delegation of two women belonging to different parties.\n\n\nIn November 2022, Dianne Feinstein became the longest-serving female senator in history,[8] surpassing Barbara Mikulski,[9][10] having served for 30 years.[11] Feinstein was retiring at the end of her last term, scheduled for January 3, 2025,[12] but died on September 29, 2023, before her term ended.[13]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThis article covers the history of **women in the United States Senate** and various milestones achieved by female senators. It includes a list of all women who have served in the Senate, a list of current female senators, and a list of states represented by women in the Senate. The first female U.S. senator, Rebecca Latimer Felton, represented Georgia for a single day in 1922, and the first woman elected to the Senate, Hattie Caraway, was elected from Arkansas in 1932. Sixty women have served in the upper house of the United States Congress since its establishment in 1789. As of October 3, 2023, there are 25 women (15 Democrats, 9 Republicans, and 1 Independent) serving as U.S. senators.\n\n\nNancy Kassebaum is currently the oldest living former female member of the Senate at the age 91.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMartha McSally lost an election to finish John McCain's unexpired term on November 3, 2020, and left the Congress on December 2, which reduced the number of female senators to 25. On January 3, 2021, Cynthia Lummis, the first woman senator from Wyoming, began her term, so the number of female senators reached 26 once again. Meanwhile, Kamala Harris was elected Vice President of the United States; she resigned her Senate seat on January 18 in anticipation of the scheduled commencement of her term as Vice President (and thus President of the Senate) on January 20, which reduced the number of female senators to 25. In addition, Loeffler lost the January 5 special election runoff for the remainder of the term to which she had been appointed, and she left office also on January 20, which further reduced the number of women serving in the Senate to 24. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Rebecca Latimer Felton (D-Georgia), the first female member of the United States Senate, who served for a single day in 1922.\n![](image)One woman (Barbara Mikulski) was reelected and four women were elected to the Senate in 1992, the \"Year of the Woman,\" Left to right: Senators Murray, Moseley Braun, Mikulski, Feinstein, and Boxer.\n![](image)By the 111th United States Congress (2009\u20132011), the number of women senators had increased to 17, including 4 Republicans and 13 Democrats\nFor its first 130 years in existence, the Senate's membership was entirely male. Until 1920, few women ran for the Senate. Until the 1990s, very few were elected. This paucity of women was due to many factors, including the lack of women's suffrage in many states until the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, women's limited access to higher education until the mid-1900s, public perceptions of gender roles, and barriers to women's advancement such as sex discrimination.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2012, a record five new female senators were elected. This beat the record of four new female senators from 1992 and set the record of five new women and eleven female senators in one Senate class. The five new women were Democrats Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and Republican Deb Fischer of Nebraska. Hirono was the first Asian-American woman and first Buddhist in the Senate, and Baldwin was the first openly gay person in the Senate.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | Rebecca Felton\n | 1922, 1931\u20131945, 1948\u20131973,\n1978\u2013present\n | 1932\n |\n\n\n## Graphs[edit]\n\n\n### Histograph[edit]\n\n\nNote: In the graph below, entry dates refer to the date the senator was sworn in, not the date of the appointment, or election.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Starting\n | Total\n | Graph\n | Event\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| March 4, 1789 | 0 |  |  |\n| November 21, 1922 | 1 | |  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n | ![Increase](image) Rebecca Felton appointed\n |\n| November 23, 1922 | 0 |  | ![Decrease](image) End of Rebecca Felton's appointment\n |\n| December 9, 1931 | 1 | |  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n | ![Increase](image) Hattie Caraway appointed\n |\n| January 31, 1936 | 2 | |  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n | ![Increase](image) Rose Long appointed\n |\n| January 3, 1937 | 1 | |  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n | ![Decrease](image) End of Rose Long's appointment\n |\n| August 20, 1937 | 2 | |  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
