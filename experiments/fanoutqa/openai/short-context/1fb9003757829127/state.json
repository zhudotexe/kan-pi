After a significant lull, construction projects since the mid-1990s began taking the skyline upwards, with a major acceleration in the pace of development since 2000, when the Lower Parel area began developing. Palais Royale structurally topped out in 2018 and is the tallest building in the country with a height of 320 meters.\n\n\n\n\n## List of tallest buildings in Mumbai[edit]\n\n\nThis list ranks the tallest completed and topped out buildings in Mumbai that stand at least 150\u00a0m (492\u00a0ft) as of October 2023.

It was the tallest skyscraper in India from 2010 to 2019 when it was overtaken by Lodha The Park which again was overtaken by Palais Royale Mumbai. It has been home to several high-net-worth individuals.[7]\n\n\n\n## Location[edit]\n\n\nDesigned by architect Hafeez Contractor, The Imperial is built in Tardeo, South Mumbai and is perhaps Contractor's most recognisable project to date. The project's use of the modern urban redevelopment model in which the building firm provides free land and rehabilitation to slum dwellers in exchange for rights for property development was the first implementation of this model on a large scale.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of tallest buildings in Mumbai\n* List of tallest buildings in India\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| The Imperial |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) |\n| ![Map](image) |\n| Record height |\n| Tallest in India from 2010 to 2019[I] |\n| Preceded by | Planet Godrej |\n| General information |\n| Type | Residential Condominiums |\n| Location | Balkrishna Nakashe Marg, Tardeo, Mumbai, India |\n| Address | Altamount Road & Tardeo Road |\n| Coordinates | 18\u00b058\u203215\u2033N 72\u00b048\u203246\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff18.9709\u00b0N 72.8129\u00b0E\ufeff / 18.9709; 72.8129 |\n| Construction started | 2005 |\n| Completed | 2010 |\n| Owner | S D Corporation Pvt.

Being the technology capital of India makes it one of the fastest growing mega cities in the world. The influx of high-skilled individuals from all parts of India come here for job and business opportunities. This is the reason why there is always demand for office and living space within the city and as a result Bengaluru is moving towards vertical development. CNTC Presidential Tower (topped-out in early 2023) is currently the tallest building in the city. It is 161 metres (528 ft) tall and has 50 floors. The World Trade Center (topped out in 2010) is currently the tallest commercial building in the city. It is 128 metres (420 ft) tall and has 32 floors. The World Trade Center, the UB Tower, the Mantri DSK Pinnacle, and Phoenix One Bangalore West are some of the various prominent skyscrapers in the city. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nLists of tallest buildings in India\n |\n| --- |\n| * Tallest buildings in India\n* Tallest buildings by city\n* Tallest under construction\n* Tallest on-hold, approved and proposed\n* Timeline of tallest buildings\n |\n| * Ahmedabad\n* Bangalore\n* Chennai\n* Delhi\n* Hyderabad\n* Kerala\n* Kochi\n* Kolkata\n* Lucknow\n* Mangalore\n* Mumbai\n* Navi Mumbai\n* Pune\n |\n\n## External links[edit]\n\n\n* Buildings in Bangalore, Emporis.com\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs of now there are almost 1,500[1] high-rise buildings and 2 skyscrapers that have already been constructed in Bengaluru and many more high-rise buildings are currently under construction in the city right now.\n\n\n\n\n## Tallest buildings[edit]\n\n\nThis lists ranks buildings in Bengaluru that stand at least 100 metres (328\u00a0ft) or 30 floors from the ground.
