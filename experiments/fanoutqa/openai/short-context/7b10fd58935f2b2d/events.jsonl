The award was first presented in 1995 under the name **Best Alternative Album**, and adopted its current name in 2003.\n\n\n\n\n## Achievements[edit]\n\n\nArcade Fire and July Talk have won the award three times to date, while Broken Social Scene, Metric, Alvvays and Rufus Wainwright have won the award twice each. In addition to Broken Social Scene's wins as a band, three members have also won the award for separate projects — Emily Haines and James Shaw have also won the award twice with their band Metric, and Leslie Feist has won for a solo album. Arcade Fire have been nominated for the award four times overall, while Broken Social Scene, Metric, Stars, Chad VanGaalen, Tegan and Sara and July Talk have received three nominations each.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Best Alternative Album: Yearly summary: 1995\". *JunoAward.ca*.

She is married to co-founder Win Butler.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and career[edit]\n\n\nRégine Alexandra Chassagne was born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, and grew up in St-Lambert, a suburb south of Montreal.[2][3] Her parents, who were Haitians of mixed French and African descent, moved from Haiti during the dictatorship of François Duvalier, which is alluded to in the Arcade Fire song \"Haïti\", in which she sings, **Mes cousins jamais nés hantent les nuits de Duvalier** (\"My unborn cousins haunt Duvalier's nights\").[4] The line is in reference to the relatives who were killed during the Jérémie Vespers massacre.\n\n\nChassagne attended *Collège Jean-de-Brébeuf* before earning a B.A. in communication studies at Concordia University[5] in 1998,[6] and went on to study jazz voice briefly at McGill University.[7] She was singing jazz at an art opening at Concordia in 2000, when Win Butler met her and persuaded her to join his band. They married in 2003. Ten years later, their son was born on 21 April 2013.[8][9]\n\n\nChassagne has also been involved with a medieval-themed band called *Les Jongleurs de la Mandragore*[10] and with Jimmy Rouleau in the jazz duo Azúcar.[11] She also wrote the music for the two-minute David Uloth short film \"The Shine\", and she contributed to the UNICEF benefit project as part of the North American Hallowe'en Prevention Initiative, performing the song \"Do They Know It's Hallowe'en?\" along with Win Butler.\n\n\nShe plays many instruments on stage, including accordion, drums, xylophone, hurdy-gurdy, keyboards, organ and guitar. In Arcade Fire, Chassagne performs lead vocals on some songs, including \"Haiti\", \"In the Backseat\", \"Black Wave/Bad Vibrations\", \"Empty Room\", \"Abraham's Daughter\", \"Sprawl II (Mountains Beyond Mountains)\", \"Creature Comfort\", \"Electric Blue\", and \"Unconditional II (Race and Religion)\".\n\n\nIn March 2015, Chassagne, along with Win Butler, attended the launch of music streaming service Tidal, and revealed themselves, along with other notable artists, as shareholders in the company.[12]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nChassagne has been married to fellow Arcade Fire member Win Butler since 2003. They had a son in April 2013.[13]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Hoard, Christian (10 March 2005). \"The Fire This Time\". *Rolling Stone*. No. 969. pp. 59–60.

His late father was David Parry of the folk band Friends of Fiddler's Green. His mother, Caroline Balderston Parry, was a poet and musician, and his sister, Evalyn Parry, is a theatre artist, songwriter, and spoken word performer.[2][3] Parry's family is Quaker and Parry grew up attending Toronto Monthly Meeting.[4][5]\n\n\nParry attended Canterbury High School in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada and was one of a dozen members of the Literary Arts program (first generation). His classmates include *Stargate: Atlantis* writer Martin Gero and *The Holmes Show* comedian Kurt Smeaton.\n\n\nIn the mid 1990s, he worked summers at a vegetarian camp in near Chelsea, Quebec, called *Camp Au Grand Bois*.\n\n\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, he studied electroacoustics and contemporary dance at Concordia University in Montreal.\n\n\nThe Bell Orchestre was formed in 2005, along with Sarah Neufeld, Tim Kingsbury as well as Stefan Schneider and French horn player Pietro Amato. Parry primarily plays double bass and is the de facto producer.[6][7] Bell Orchestre released *As Seen Through Windows* with Arts & Crafts Records on March 10, 2009.[8] It was recorded with John Mcentire in Soma Electric Studios in Chicago, Illinois. The album since won a 2011 Juno Award for best instrumental album.\n\n\nA long-time core member of Arcade Fire, he co-produced and collaborated on the debut EP, *Arcade Fire*, before the first lineup of the band fell apart. Helping to reform and recreate the band, Parry brought in Bell Orchestre bandmate Sarah Neufeld, and New International Standards bandmates, Tim Kingsbury and Jeremy Gara.\n\n\nHe has also made musical contributions to albums by The National, Little Scream, Sufjan Stevens, The Unicorns and Islands. On the latter's critically acclaimed 2006 album Return to the Sea, he played several instruments, sang background vocals and arranged strings, and appeared with the band's 2016 10-year-anniversary shows where they played the album in full.\nParry has also performed in a cover band called Phi Slamma Jamma along with Arcade Fire bandmates Will Butler, Jeremy Gara, and Tim Kingsbury. The group performed at the 2011 POP Montreal Festival as well as the 2012 Crossing Brooklyn Ferry Festival.\n\n\nOn January 20, 2007, Parry returned to Canterbury High to perform a concert with Arcade Fire in the school's cafeteria. Only 400 students and staff were permitted to attend the show. Beforehand, those chosen had the opportunity to preview new, unreleased songs from the Arcade Fire's upcoming album. After the show, there was a brief autograph period and the students met with the band members.[9]\n\n\nHe was also formerly a member of the band the New International Standards, with Tim Kingsbury and Jeremy Gara.[5] His first work for Orchestra, entitled *For Heart, Breath and Orchestra.* It was recorded by the Kitchener-Waterloo Symphony, on their 2011 album *From Here on Out* alongside pieces by Jonny Greenwood and Nico Muhly. He has also written commissioned works for Kronos Quartet, yMusic and Bryce Dessner, and his chamber works also have been performed by the Calder Quartet and Warhol Dervish.\nParry appeared at each night of the 2012 All Tomorrow's Parties festival, mounting a \"moving surround sound sci-fi composition for bicycles and boomboxes\" entitled *Drones/Revelations*, as well as performing songs with a folk trio called *Quiet River of Dust*, and as part of a chamber music ensemble performing Parry's *Music for Heart and Breath*. The lineup included Owen Pallett, Nico Muhly, Bryce Dessner, Aaron Dessner, Gaspar Claus, Nadia Sirota, Kyle Resnick, and Dave Nelson.\nHe occasionally performs as drummer and backup singer with Little Scream.[10]\n\n\nParry has also collaborated with The National, arranging vocals and writing guitar parts for their songs on their 2010 album *High Violet* and appeared with them singing and playing guitar and double bass in their Vevo live event as well as on their Late Night with David Letterman appearance in 2011. He has joined them frequently onstage as a guest during many performances, including Lollapalooza 2010 (at which Arcade Fire also performed) and also during a brief segment of Arcade Fire's 2011 midwestern US tour in which The National acted as openers. Parry has also collaborated with Bryce Dessner of The National on classical compositions, performing together at the Edinburgh Festival in 2015.[2]\n\n\nParry recently co-hosted a BBC 6 Music Takeover programme with the members of The National called Arcade Fire and the National Takeover\n[11] Parry and brothers Aaron & Bryce Dessner who play guitar in The National have been long-term friends since meeting on the American alt-rock circuit, regularly appearing on the same festival bills worldwide.\n[11] Their friendship was cemented when Richard from the Arcade Fire contributed to a number of songs on The National's album High Violet, most notably playing double bass and guitar on 'Vanderlyle Crybaby Geeks', and doing the vocal harmony arrangements on 'Conversation 16' and 'Sorrow'. During this show Parry mentioned he was producing an album by a local Montreal artist named Little Scream.\n\n\nIn July 2018 Parry announced the upcoming release of two albums: *Quiet River Of Dust Vol. 1* and *Quiet River Of Dust Vol. 2*.[12] The albums are inspired by Buddhist myths, death poems, British folk songs, and a recent trip to Japan.[12]\n\n\nBetween 2019 and 2021, Richard Reed Parry produced The Sadies' 2022 album *Colder Streams* at Montréal's Skybarn.[13] This was the last album by The Sadies to feature founding member Dallas Good, who died suddenly of natural causes on February 17, 2022, at the age of 48.[14] Shortly after, Parry announced via Instagram that he and Dallas had been working on an album on and off since 2008 with the working title The Watchtower. Unfinished at the time of Dallas Good's death, Parry plans to finish the album.[15]\n\n\n\n## Discography[edit]\n\n\n### Solo works[edit]\n\n\n* *Master Mix: Red Hot + Arthur Russell* (2 tracks on compilation LP), (Yep Roc, 2012)\n* *From Here on Out* Kitchener-Waterloo Symphony, (LP, Analekta, 2012)\n* *Spirit of Talk Talk*, (track on compilation LP, Fierce Panda, 2012)\n* *Have Not Been the Same*, (track on compilation LP, Zunior, 2012)\n* *Music For Heart and Breath* Kronos Quartet, yMusic, Bryce and Aaron Dessner, Nadia Sirota, (LP, Deutsche Grammophon, 2014)\n* *Quiet River of Dust* (LP, Secret City Records, 2018)\n* *Quiet River of Dust Vol. 2: That Side of the River* (LP, ANTI-/Secret City Records, 2019)[16]\n* *The Nest* (soundtrack LP, 2020)[17]\n\n\n### Arcade Fire[edit]\n\n\n* *Arcade Fire* (EP, Merge, 2003)\n* *Funeral* (LP, Merge, 2004)\n* *Neon Bible* (LP, Merge, 2007)\n* *The Suburbs* (LP, Merge, 2010)\n* *Reflektor* (LP, Merge, 2013)\n* *Everything Now* (LP, Sonovox, 2017)\n* *We* (LP, Sonovox, 2022)\n\n\n### Bell Orchestre[edit]\n\n\n* *Bell Orchestre*, (demo, 2002)\n* *Recording a Tape the Colour of the Light*, (album, 2005)\n* *As Seen Through Windows*, (LP, released on March 10, 2009)\n* *Who Designs Nature's How*, (EP, released on August 25, 2009)\n\n\n### Little Scream[edit]\n\n\n* *The Golden Record*, (LP, Secretly Canadian, 2011)\n\n\n### The National[edit]\n\n\n* *Trouble Will Find Me*, (LP, 4AD, 2013)\n* *High Violet*, (LP, 4AD, 2010)\n\n\n### Barr Brothers[edit]\n\n\n* *Sleeping Operator*, (LP, Secret City Records, 2014)\n\n\n### Islands[edit]\n\n\n* *Return to the Sea*, (LP, Rough Trade, 2007)\n\n\n### The Unicorns[edit]\n\n\n* *Who Will Cut Our Hair When We're Gone?*, (LP, Rough Trade, 2004)\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Jeremy Gara and Richard Reed Parry of Arcade Fire.

He co-founded the Montreal-based indie rock band Arcade Fire with Josh Deu and his wife Régine Chassagne.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nButler was born in Truckee, California, and raised in The Woodlands, Texas, with a Mormon upbringing.[4][5][6] He lived in Buenos Aires, Argentina, before his brother Will was born.[7]\n\n\nHis father, Edwin Farnham Butler II, worked as a geologist for oil conglomerate Halliburton in Houston, Texas.[8] His mother, Liza Rey, who performed on the family TV show, *The King Family Show*, plays jazz harp and sings. Butler's parents currently live on Mount Desert Island, Maine.[9] Butler's maternal grandfather was jazz steel guitarist Alvino Rey, a pioneer bandleader whose career spanned eight decades.[10] His maternal grandmother, Luise, was a member of The King Sisters, who starred in a weekly variety program on ABC called *The King Family Show*.\n\n\nAt the age of 15, Butler started attending the Phillips Exeter Academy preparatory school in New Hampshire, where he lived in Abbot Hall.[11] After graduation, he studied photography and creative writing at Sarah Lawrence College, but left after a year.\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nButler moved to Montreal, Quebec, Canada in 2000 to attend McGill University, where he met his future wife, Régine Chassagne,[12] whom he married in 2003.[13] Butler graduated from McGill in 2004 with a bachelor's degree in religious studies.[14][15]\n\n\nButler participated in the 2005 UNICEF benefit project, \"Do They Know It's Hallowe'en?,\" along with Chassagne. The two also collaborated on the music for the Richard Kelly film *The Box*.[16]\n\n\nOn April 2, 2011, LCD Soundsystem played its last concert before its disbandment. Arcade Fire performed with them during the song \"North American Scum.\" During James Murphy's stumbling introduction to the song, Butler shouted out \"shut up and play the hits!\" Murphy immediately responded, \"ladies and gentlemen, for our live record entitled 'Shut Up and Play the Hits'\" and Butler's cry later became the title of the documentary of the concert.[17]\nIn September 2011, Butler played in a charity basketball tournament in Toronto, Ontario, known as \"Rock The Court.\" Several other celebrities and athletes participated, such as Matt Bonner of the San Antonio Spurs.[18]\n\n\nButler also works as a DJ using the stage name Windows 98. Sometimes he works under this moniker as the opening act for Arcade Fire itself.[1][19]\n\n\nIn March 2015, Butler and Chassagne attended the launch of music streaming service Tidal, and revealed themselves, along with other notable artists, as shareholders in the company.[20]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nButler is married to fellow Arcade Fire member Régine Chassagne, who gave birth to the couple's only child, a son, in 2013.[21]\n\n\nButler was naturalized as a Canadian citizen on July 9, 2019, in a ceremony held in Montreal and hosted by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada minister Ahmed Hussen.[22]\n\n\nButler is a frequent participant in the NBA All-Star Celebrity Game, and won the game's Most Valuable Player award in 2016.[23]\n\n\n\n### Sexual misconduct allegations[edit]\n\n\nAccording to a *Pitchfork* article published on August 27, 2022, four individuals have accused Butler of sexual misconduct, with some saying he initially contacted them on social media.[24] Butler said all contact with the accusers was consensual, and he denies all allegations of misconduct. In a statement to Pitchfork, a representative for Butler acknowledged he had sexual interactions with each of them, but said they were not initiated by him and were consensual. Chassagne corroborated his statements.[25]\n\n\nOn November 22, 2022, *Pitchfork* published a follow-up article detailing Butler's manipulative interactions towards a fifth person. These interactions were described by the individual as \"Emotionally abusive, manipulative, toxic, and using his power dynamic to exploit my body at times that were convenient for him.\"[26]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Yoshida, Emily (March 19, 2015). \"Arcade Fire's Win Butler is DJing at SXSW under the name DJ Windows 98, and this is what that's like\". *The Verge*.

He plays bass guitar, guitar, and occasionally keyboards.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nKingsbury spent his early years living in and around Guelph, Ontario.[1] He comes from a musical family; his mother Birdie was a pianist and a music director and Parkwood Gardens Community church in Guelph, and Kingsbury sang in the church choir.[2] His brother Brett is a professional classical pianist. After piano lessons as a child, Kingsbury stopped playing music until a friend of his mother gave him a guitar when he was fourteen. He began to teach himself to play and write music.[3] Kingsbury attended John F. Ross in Guelph[4] where he began playing in bands when he was sixteen.[3] Christian rock was an early influence for Kingsbury,[2] especially the music of pioneering American Christian rock artist Larry Norman.[3] Kingsbury cites his later influences as Pavement and Palace and Dinosaur Jr.[3] He played with Gentleman Reg while in high school, only playing one show outside of Guelph.[5]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nAfter high school, Kingsbury moved to Ottawa where he played with a number of bands such as the Killers and Geoffrey Pye, before joining Clark the band. While in Ottawa he met Jeremy Gara. The two played together in a band in Ottawa and would later move to Montreal and play together in The New International Standards, Arcade Fire and Kingsbury's solo project, Sam Patch.[6]\n\n\nKingsbury moved to Montreal in 2001.[7] Kingsbury had a hard time finding full-time work with a band and made ends meet by working as a telemarketer for a pharmaceutical company.[4] At the same time, he played in a number of bands, including the New International Standards.[5] The New International Standards included Richard Reed Parry, Annesley Black and Mike Feuerstack. The band was active for about two years. It was Parry that brought Kingsbury into Arcade Fire.[5]\n\n\n\n### Arcade Fire[edit]\n\n\nKingsbury began to play with Arcade Fire in 2003 after the break-up of the band's original membership.[8] Although Kingsbury primarily plays bass in Arcade Fire, he also plays guitar and sings.[7]\n\n\nGuelph continues to be a contact for Kingsbury and the fellow members of Arcade Fire. Arcade Fire performed at Guelph’s Hillside Festival in 2005, a performance Sam Baijal, artistic director of Hillside, credits with giving the Festival a huge boost in popularity.[4]\n\n\n\n### Other projects[edit]\n\n\nKingsbury also toured and recorded with Montreal band Wolf Parade as a bassist, appearing on the album the 2005 album *Apologies to the Queen Mary*.[9] He has also been involved with the bands Clark and The New International Standards in addition to recording as a solo artist.[10]\n\n\n\n### Sam Patch[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2015 he launched a side project under the name \"Sam Patch\" along with fellow Arcade Fire member Jeremy Gara and Toronto artist Basia Bulat.[11] He played his first show as Sam Patch at Montreal's *Bar Le Ritz*.[12] Kingsbury began writing music while on tour with Arcade Fire and recorded the album *Yeah You, and I* post-tour, with Gara, Bulat. John McEntire of the bands Sea and Cake, and Tortoise and fellow Tortoise member Doug McCombs also appear.[13] Kingsbury named the project after an early 19th-century daredevil by the same name. Sam Patch, also known as the Jersey Jumper, would jump from bridges, buildings and other heights, including the Niagara River at the base of the Falls. Patch met his death in 1829 attempting a stunt at Rochester's High Falls.[6]\n\n\nKingsbury recorded the song \"In to Trouble\" for the film 2020 film *Pieces of a Woman*, and in 2021 released the song as a digital single.[14]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Record, The. \"'To us, he'll always just be Tim'\". *www.therecord.com*.
