Until 2016, the championship winners could compete in the following year's FIFA Confederations Cup, but were not obliged to do so.[3] From the 2020 edition onwards, the winner competes in the CONMEBOL–UEFA Cup of Champions.\n\n\nThe sixteen European Championship tournaments have been won by ten national teams: Germany and Spain have each won three titles, Italy and France have won two titles, and the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, the Netherlands, Denmark, Greece and Portugal have won one title each. To date, Spain is the only team to have won consecutive titles, doing so in 2008 and 2012.\n\n\nThe most recent championship, held across Europe in 2021 (postponed from 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic), was won by Italy, who lifted their second European title after beating England in the final at Wembley Stadium in London on penalties.[4][5]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Beginnings[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* **2020:** ![Europe](image) Uniforia (until quarter-finals) & Uniforia Finale (from semi-finals)\n* **2024:** ![Germany](image) Fussballliebe\n |\n| Video games | * **1992:** ![Sweden](image) *Champions of Europe*\n* **1996:** ![England](image) *UEFA Euro 96 England*\n* **2000:** ![Belgium](image)![Netherlands](image) *UEFA Euro 2000*\n* **2004:** ![Portugal](image) *UEFA Euro 2004*\n* **2008:** ![Austria](image)![Switzerland](image) *UEFA Euro 2008*\n* **2012:** ![Poland](image)![Ukraine](image) *UEFA Euro 2012*\n* **2016:** ![France](image) *Pro Evolution Soccer: UEFA Euro 2016 France*\n* **2020:** ![Europe](image) *eFootball PES 2020* & *2021 Season Update*\n* **2024:** ![Germany](image) *EA Sports FC 24*\n |\n |\n\n| Authority control databases ![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\n |\n| --- |\n| International | * VIAF\n |\n| National | * France\n* BnF data\n* Germany\n* Czech Republic\n\t+ 2\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Map of countries' best results. 10 countries have won, counting Germany and West Germany as one\nSixteen teams progressed to the final tournament for the 2012 tournament. They were joint hosts Poland and Ukraine, the winners and the highest ranked second-placed team from the nine qualifying groups as well as the winners of four play-off matches between the runners-up of the other groups. These sixteen teams were divided equally into four groups, A, B, C and D, each consisting of four teams. The groups were drawn up by the UEFA administration, again using seeding. The seeded teams being the host nations, the reigning champions, should they qualify, and those with the best points per game coefficients over the qualifying phase of the tournament and the previous World Cup qualifying. Other finalists were assigned to by means of a draw, using coefficients as a basis.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n79. **^** \"Uefa to expand Euro Championship\". *BBC Sport*.

The same points system is used (three points for a win, one point for a draw, no points for a defeat). A schedule for the group matches will be drawn up, but the last two matches in a group must kick off simultaneously. The winner and runner-up of each group progress to the next round, where a knockout system is used (the two teams play each other once, the winner progresses), this is used in all subsequent rounds as well. The winners of the quarter-finals matches progress to the semi-finals, where the winners play in the final. If in any of the knockout rounds, the scores are still equal after normal playing time, extra time and penalties are employed to separate the two teams.

Seeded teams include reigning champions and other teams based on their performance in the preceding FIFA World Cup qualifying and the last European Championship qualifying. To obtain an accurate view of the teams' abilities, a ranking is produced. This is calculated by taking the total number of points won by a particular team and dividing it by the number of games played, i.e. points per game. In the case of a team having hosted one of the two previous competitions and therefore having qualified automatically, only the results from the single most recent qualifying competition are used. If two teams have equal points per game, the committee then bases their positions in the rankings on:\n\n\n\n1. Coefficient from the matches played in its most recent qualifying competition.\n2. Average goal difference.\n3. Average number of goals scored.\n4. Average number of away goals scored.\n5. Drawing of lots.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe **UEFA European Football Championship**,[1] less formally the **European Championship** and informally the **Euro**, is the primary association football tournament organised by the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA). The competition is contested by UEFA members' senior men's national teams, determining the continental champion of Europe. It is the second-most watched football tournament in the world after the FIFA World Cup. The Euro 2012 final was watched by a global audience of around 300 million.[2] The competition has been held every four years since 1960, except for 2020, when it was postponed until 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe, but kept the name Euro 2020. Scheduled to be in the even-numbered year between FIFA World Cup tournaments, it was originally called the **European Nations' Cup** before changing to its current name in 1968. Since 1996, the individual events have been branded as \"**UEFA Euro [year]**\".\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_k1IRLUwHMMv00sYHSMTUEMR4","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

Worldwide, France's ranking has fallen to twentieth most populous country;\n* In 2005 it was projected that if current demographic trends continued (i.e. declining population in Germany, and slightly rising population in France and the UK), around 2050 metropolitan France could again surpass the population of Germany, becoming the most populous state in the European Union.[25] In contrast, 2009 UN projections say that the stronger-growing United Kingdom could be more populous than metropolitan France in 2050, leaving metropolitan France third amongst European nations, behind Russia and the UK.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn the above list, Turkey is not considered a European country. Turkey was less populous than metropolitan France until 1992 but is now more populous.[26]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nDemographics of Europe\n |\n| --- |\n| Sovereign states | * Albania\n* Andorra\n* Armenia\n* Austria\n* Azerbaijan\n* Belarus\n* Belgium\n* Bosnia and Herzegovina\n* Bulgaria\n* Croatia\n* Cyprus\n* Czech Republic\n* Denmark\n* Estonia\n* Finland\n* France\n* Georgia\n* Germany\n* Greece\n* Hungary\n* Iceland\n* Ireland\n* \n* Italy\n* Kazakhstan\n* Latvia\n* Liechtenstein\n* Lithuania\n* Luxembourg\n* Malta\n* Moldova\n* Monaco\n* Montenegro\n* Netherlands\n* North Macedonia\n* Norway\n* Poland\n* Portugal\n* Romania\n* Russia\n* San Marino\n* Serbia\n* Slovakia\n* Slovenia\n* Spain\n* Sweden\n* Switzerland\n* Turkey\n* Ukraine\n* United Kingdom\n\t+ England\n\t+ Northern Ireland\n\t+ Scotland\n\t+ Wales\n* Vatican City\n |\n| States with limitedrecognition | * Abkhazia\n* Kosovo\n* Northern Cyprus\n* South Ossetia\n* Transnistria\n |\n| Dependencies andother entities | * Åland\n* Faroe Islands\n* Gibraltar\n* Guernsey\n* Isle of Man\n* Jersey\n* Svalbard\n |\n| Other entities | * European Union\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 12\n | 11\n | Rouen[170] | 663,743\n | 643,499\n | +0.36%\n | 2,367\n |\n| 13\n | 13\n | Toulon[171] | 622,895\n | 598,514\n | +0.28%\n | 1,196\n |\n| 14\n | 15\n | Montpellier[172] | 599,965\n | 529,401\n | +1.18%\n | 1,673\n |\n| 15\n | 14\n | Douai - Lens[173] | 539,715\n | 545,636\n | −0.10%\n | 679\n |\n| 16\n | 17\n | Avignon[174] | 527,731\n | 501,866\n | +0.52%\n | 2,083\n |\n| 17\n | 16\n | Saint-Étienne[175] | 515,585\n | 508,284\n | +0.01%\n | 1,689\n |\n| 18\n | 18\n | Tours[176] | 492,722\n | 469,244\n | +0.47%\n | 3,184\n |\n| 19\n | 19\n | Clermont-Ferrand[177] | 479,096\n | 454,553\n | +0.55%\n | 2,420\n |\n| 20\n | 20\n | Nancy[178] | 435,336\n | 432,481\n | +0.10%\n | 2,367\n |\n\n\nUrbanization\n\nurban population: 81% of total population (2020)\nrate of urbanization: 0.72% annual rate of change (2015-20 est.)\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_stZiWmbapKb9genmG6gSeVgx","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
