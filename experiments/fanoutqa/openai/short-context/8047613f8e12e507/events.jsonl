With the budding of capitalism, philosophers such as Wang Yangming further critiqued and expanded Neo-Confucianism with concepts of individualism and equality of four occupations.[76] The scholar-official stratum became a supporting force of industry and commerce in the tax boycott movements, which, together with the famines and defense against Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598) and Later Jin incursions led to an exhausted treasury.[77] In 1644, Beijing was captured by a coalition of peasant rebel forces led by Li Zicheng. The Chongzhen Emperor committed suicide when the city fell. The Manchu Qing dynasty, then allied with Ming dynasty general Wu Sangui, overthrew Li's short-lived Shun dynasty and subsequently seized control of Beijing, which became the new capital of the Qing dynasty.[78]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Yinxu, the ruins of the capital of the late Shang dynasty (14th century BCE)\nAccording to Chinese tradition, the first dynasty was the Xia, which emerged around 2100 BCE.[43] The Xia dynasty marked the beginning of China's political system based on hereditary monarchies, or dynasties, which lasted for a millennium.[44] The Xia dynasty was considered mythical by historians until scientific excavations found early Bronze Age sites at Erlitou, Henan in 1959.[45] It remains unclear whether these sites are the remains of the Xia dynasty or of another culture from the same period.[46] The succeeding Shang dynasty is the earliest to be confirmed by contemporary records.[47] The Shang ruled the plain of the Yellow River in eastern China from the 17th to the 11th century BCE.[48] Their oracle bone script (from c. 1500 BCE)[49][50] represents the oldest form of Chinese writing yet found[51] and is a direct ancestor of modern Chinese characters.[52]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n Largest cities or municipalities in China*China Urban Construction Statistical Yearbook 2020* Urban Population and Urban Temporary Population [505][note 1][note 2]\n |\n| --- |\n|  | Rank | Name | Province | Municipal pop. | Rank | Name | Province | Pop. |  |\n| ![Shanghai](image)Shanghai![Beijing](image)Beijing | 1 | Shanghai | SH | 24,281,400 | 11 | Hong Kong | HK | 7,448,900\n | ![Guangzhou](image)Guangzhou![Shenzhen](image)Shenzhen |\n| 2 | Beijing | BJ | 19,164,000 | 12 | Zhengzhou | HA | 7,179,400\n |\n| 3 | Guangzhou | GD | 13,858,700 | 13 | Nanjing | JS | 6,823,500\n |\n| 4 | Shenzhen | GD | 13,438,800 | 14 | Xi'an | SN | 6,642,100\n |\n| 5 | Tianjin | TJ | 11,744,400 | 15 | Jinan | SD | 6,409,600\n |\n| 6 | Chongqing | CQ | 11,488,000 | 16 | Shenyang | LN | 5,900,000\n |\n| 7 | Dongguan | GD | 9,752,500 | 17 | Qingdao | SD | 5,501,400\n |\n| 8 | Chengdu | SC | 8,875,600 | 18 | Harbin | HL | 5,054,500\n |\n| 9 | Wuhan | HB | 8,652,900 | 19 | Hefei | AH | 4,750,100\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| • CCP General Secretary[c]President[d]CMC Chairman[e]\n | Xi Jinping |\n| • Vice President\n | Han Zheng |\n| • Premier\n | Li Qiang |\n| • Congress Chairman\n | Zhao Leji |\n| • CPPCC Chairman[f]\n | Wang Huning |\n|  |\n| Legislature | National People's Congress |\n| Formation |\n|  |\n| • First pre-imperial dynasty\n | c. 2070 BCE |\n| • First imperial dynasty\n | 221 BCE |\n| • Establishment of the Republic of China\n | 1 January 1912 |\n| • Proclamation of the People's Republic\n | 1 October 1949 |\n| • First constitution\n | 20 September 1954 |\n| • Current constitution\n | 4 December 1982 |\n| • Most recent polity admitted\n | 20 December 1999 |\n|  |\n| Area  |\n| • Total\n | 9,596,961 km2 (3,705,407 sq mi)[g][5] (3rd / 4th) |\n| • Water (%)\n | 2.8[h] |\n| Population |\n| • 2023 estimate\n | ![Neutral decrease](image) 1,411,750,000[7] (2nd) |\n| • Density\n | 145[8]/km2 (375.5/sq mi) (83rd) |\n| GDP (PPP) | 2023 estimate |\n| • Total\n | ![Increase](image) $32.898 trillion[9] (1st) |\n| • Per capita\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nChina has three out of the ten largest stock exchanges in the world[314]—Shanghai, Hong Kong and Shenzhen—that together have a market capitalization of over $15.9 trillion, as of October 2020[update].[315] China has four (Shanghai, Hong Kong, Beijing, and Shenzhen) out of the world's top ten most competitive financial centers, which is more than any other country in the 2020 Global Financial Centres Index.[316]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**China** (Chinese: 中国; pinyin: *Zhōngguó*), officially the **People's Republic of China** (**PRC**),[k] is a country in East Asia.

The 1,609 km (1,000 mi) Indus River and its tributaries flow through the country from the Kashmir region to the Arabian Sea. There is an expanse of alluvial plains along it in the Punjab and Sindh.[164]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA federal parliamentary republic state, Pakistan is a federation that comprises four provinces: Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Sindh and Balochistan,[243] and three territories: Islamabad Capital Territory, Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Kashmir. The Government of Pakistan exercises the *de facto* jurisdiction over the Frontier Regions and the western parts of the Kashmir Regions, which are organised into the separate political entities Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan (formerly Northern Areas). In 2009, the constitutional assignment (the *Gilgit–Baltistan Empowerment and Self-Governance Order*) awarded the Gilgit-Baltistan a semi-provincial status, giving it self-government.[244]\n\n\nThe local government system consists of a three-tier system of districts, tehsils, and union councils, with an elected body at each tier.[245] There are about 130 districts altogether, of which Azad Kashmir has ten[246] and Gilgit-Baltistan seven.[247]\n\n\n\nClickable map of the four provinces and three federal territories of Pakistan.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Government | Federal Islamic parliamentary republic |\n|  |\n| • President\n | Arif Alvi |\n| • Prime Minister\n | Anwaar ul Haq Kakar (Caretaker) |\n| • Chairman of the Senate\n | Sadiq Sanjrani |\n| • Speaker of the National Assembly\n | Raja Pervaiz Ashraf |\n| • Chief Justice\n | Qazi Faez Isa |\n|  |\n| Legislature | Parliament |\n| • Upper house\n | Senate |\n| • Lower house\n | National Assembly |\n| Independence from the United Kingdom\n |\n|  |\n| • Declaration\n | 23 March 1940 |\n| • Independence\n | 14 August 1947 |\n| • Dominion status terminated\n | 23 March 1956 |\n| • Purchase of Gwadar\n | 8 December 1958 |\n| • Eastern territory withdrawn\n | 16 December 1971 |\n| • Current constitution\n | 14 August 1973 |\n|  |\n| Area  |\n| • Total\n | 881,913 km2 (340,509 sq mi)[b][9] (33rd) |\n| • Water (%)\n | 2.86 |\n| Population |\n| • 2023 census\n | 241,499,431[10] |\n| • Density\n | 273.8/km2 (709.1/sq mi) (56th) |\n| GDP (PPP) | 2023 estimate |\n| • Total\n | ![Increase](image) $1.568 trillion[11] (23rd) |\n| • Per capita\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPakistan's tourist attractions range from the mangroves in the south to the Himalayan hill stations in the north-east.

The majority of the population in the south resides along the Indus River, with Karachi the most populous commercial city.[475] In the east, west, and north, most of the population lives in an arc formed by the cities of Lahore, Faisalabad, Rawalpindi, Islamabad, Sargodha, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Gujrat, Jhelum, Sheikhupura, Nowshera, Mardan, and Peshawar. During the period 1990–2008, city dwellers made up 36% of Pakistan's population, making it the most urbanised nation in South Asia. Furthermore, more than 50% of Pakistanis live in towns of 5,000 people or more.[476] Immigration, from both within and outside the country, is regarded as one of the main factors contributing to urbanisation in Pakistan. One analysis of the 1998 national census highlighted the significance of the partition of India in the 1940s as it relates to urban change in Pakistan.[477]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n126. **^** \"Pakistan: Shehbaz Sharif chosen as PM after week-long uncertainty\".

Indonesia is the world's largest archipelagic state and the 14th-largest country by area, at 1,904,569 square kilometres (735,358 square miles). With around 279 million people, Indonesia is the world's fourth-most populous country and the most populous Muslim-majority country. Java, the world's most populous island, is home to more than half of the country's population.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIndonesia lies between latitudes 11°S and 6°N and longitudes 95°E and 141°E. A transcontinental country spanning Southeast Asia and Oceania, it is the world's largest archipelagic state, extending 5,120 kilometres (3,181 mi) from east to west and 1,760 kilometres (1,094 mi) from north to south.[75] The country's Coordinating Ministry for Maritime and Investments Affairs says Indonesia has 17,504 islands (with 16,056 registered at the UN)[76] scattered over both sides of the equator, around 6,000 of which are inhabited.[77] The largest are Sumatra, Java, Borneo (shared with Brunei and Malaysia), Sulawesi, and New Guinea (shared with Papua New Guinea).[78] Indonesia shares land borders with Malaysia on Borneo and Sebatik, Papua New Guinea on the island of New Guinea, East Timor on the island of Timor, and maritime borders with Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam, the Philippines, Palau, and Australia.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNine provinces—Aceh, Jakarta, Yogyakarta, Papua, Central Papua, Highland Papua, South Papua, Southwest Papua and West Papua—are granted a special autonomous status (*otonomi khusus*) from the central government. A conservative Islamic territory, Aceh has the right to create some aspects of an independent legal system implementing *sharia*.[138] Jakarta is the only city with a provincial government due to its position as the capital of Indonesia.[139][140] Yogyakarta is the only pre-colonial monarchy legally recognised within Indonesia, with the positions of governor and vice governor being prioritised for the reigning Sultan of Yogyakarta and Duke of Pakualaman, respectively.[141] The six Papuan provinces are the only ones where the indigenous people have privileges in their local government.[142]\n\n\n\nThis section is transcluded from Template:Indonesia provinces labelled map.

A shared identity has developed with the motto *\"Bhinneka Tunggal Ika\"* (\"Unity in Diversity\" *literally*, \"many, yet one\"), defined by a national language, cultural diversity, religious pluralism within a Muslim-majority population, and a history of colonialism and rebellion against it. The economy of Indonesia is the world's 16th-largest by nominal GDP and the 7th-largest by PPP. It is the world's third-largest democracy, a regional power and is considered a middle power in global affairs. The country is a member of several multilateral organisations, including the United Nations, World Trade Organization, G20, and a founding member of the Non-Aligned Movement, Association of Southeast Asian Nations, East Asia Summit, D-8 and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Names of Indonesia\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* ![](image)Definitions from Wiktionary\n* ![](image)Media from Commons\n* ![](image)News from Wikinews\n* ![](image)Quotations from Wikiquote\n* ![](image)Texts from Wikisource\n* ![](image)Textbooks from Wikibooks\n* ![](image)Resources from Wikiversity\n* ![](image)Travel information from Wikivoyage\n* ![](image)Data from Wikidata\n\n* Indonesia. *The World Factbook*.

Although relations among the diverse population are mostly harmonious, acute sectarian discontent and violence remain problematic in some areas.[73] A political settlement to an armed separatist conflict in Aceh was achieved in 2005.[74]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_5lApQqmAwiJ5ZhHYoIgeFlZd","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
