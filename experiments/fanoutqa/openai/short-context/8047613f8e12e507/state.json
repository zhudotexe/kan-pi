With the budding of capitalism, philosophers such as Wang Yangming further critiqued and expanded Neo-Confucianism with concepts of individualism and equality of four occupations.[76] The scholar-official stratum became a supporting force of industry and commerce in the tax boycott movements, which, together with the famines and defense against Japanese invasions of Korea (1592\u20131598) and Later Jin incursions led to an exhausted treasury.[77] In 1644, Beijing was captured by a coalition of peasant rebel forces led by Li Zicheng. The Chongzhen Emperor committed suicide when the city fell. The Manchu Qing dynasty, then allied with Ming dynasty general Wu Sangui, overthrew Li's short-lived Shun dynasty and subsequently seized control of Beijing, which became the new capital of the Qing dynasty.[78]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Yinxu, the ruins of the capital of the late Shang dynasty (14th century BCE)\nAccording to Chinese tradition, the first dynasty was the Xia, which emerged around 2100 BCE.[43] The Xia dynasty marked the beginning of China's political system based on hereditary monarchies, or dynasties, which lasted for a millennium.[44] The Xia dynasty was considered mythical by historians until scientific excavations found early Bronze Age sites at Erlitou, Henan in 1959.[45] It remains unclear whether these sites are the remains of the Xia dynasty or of another culture from the same period.[46] The succeeding Shang dynasty is the earliest to be confirmed by contemporary records.[47] The Shang ruled the plain of the Yellow River in eastern China from the 17th to the 11th century\u00a0BCE.[48] Their oracle bone script (from c.\u20091500 BCE)[49][50] represents the oldest form of Chinese writing yet found[51] and is a direct ancestor of modern Chinese characters.[52]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n Largest cities or municipalities in China*China Urban Construction Statistical Yearbook 2020* Urban Population and Urban Temporary Population [505][note 1][note 2]\n |\n| --- |\n|  | Rank | Name | Province | Municipal pop. | Rank | Name | Province | Pop. |  |\n| ![Shanghai](image)Shanghai![Beijing](image)Beijing | 1 | Shanghai | SH | 24,281,400 | 11 | Hong Kong | HK | 7,448,900\n | ![Guangzhou](image)Guangzhou![Shenzhen](image)Shenzhen |\n| 2 | Beijing | BJ | 19,164,000 | 12 | Zhengzhou | HA | 7,179,400\n |\n| 3 | Guangzhou | GD | 13,858,700 | 13 | Nanjing | JS | 6,823,500\n |\n| 4 | Shenzhen | GD | 13,438,800 | 14 | Xi'an | SN | 6,642,100\n |\n| 5 | Tianjin | TJ | 11,744,400 | 15 | Jinan | SD | 6,409,600\n |\n| 6 | Chongqing | CQ | 11,488,000 | 16 | Shenyang | LN | 5,900,000\n |\n| 7 | Dongguan | GD | 9,752,500 | 17 | Qingdao | SD | 5,501,400\n |\n| 8 | Chengdu | SC | 8,875,600 | 18 | Harbin | HL | 5,054,500\n |\n| 9 | Wuhan | HB | 8,652,900 | 19 | Hefei | AH | 4,750,100\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| \u2022\u00a0CCP General Secretary[c]President[d]CMC Chairman[e]\n | Xi Jinping |\n| \u2022\u00a0Vice President\n | Han Zheng |\n| \u2022\u00a0Premier\n | Li Qiang |\n| \u2022\u00a0Congress Chairman\n | Zhao Leji |\n| \u2022\u00a0CPPCC Chairman[f]\n | Wang Huning |\n|  |\n| Legislature | National People's Congress |\n| Formation |\n|  |\n| \u2022\u00a0First pre-imperial dynasty\n | c.\u20092070\u00a0BCE |\n| \u2022\u00a0First imperial dynasty\n | 221\u00a0BCE |\n| \u2022\u00a0Establishment of the Republic of China\n | 1 January 1912 |\n| \u2022\u00a0Proclamation of the People's Republic\n | 1 October 1949 |\n| \u2022\u00a0First constitution\n | 20 September 1954 |\n| \u2022\u00a0Current constitution\n | 4 December 1982 |\n| \u2022\u00a0Most recent polity admitted\n | 20 December 1999 |\n|  |\n| Area  |\n| \u2022\u00a0Total\n | 9,596,961\u00a0km2 (3,705,407\u00a0sq\u00a0mi)[g][5] (3rd / 4th) |\n| \u2022\u00a0Water\u00a0(%)\n | 2.8[h] |\n| Population |\n| \u2022\u00a02023 estimate\n | ![Neutral decrease](image) 1,411,750,000[7] (2nd) |\n| \u2022\u00a0Density\n | 145[8]/km2 (375.5/sq\u00a0mi) (83rd) |\n| GDP\u00a0(PPP) | 2023\u00a0estimate |\n| \u2022\u00a0Total\n | ![Increase](image) $32.898 trillion[9] (1st) |\n| \u2022\u00a0Per capita\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nChina has three out of the ten largest stock exchanges in the world[314]\u2014Shanghai, Hong Kong and Shenzhen\u2014that together have a market capitalization of over $15.9 trillion, as of October\u00a02020[update].[315] China has four (Shanghai, Hong Kong, Beijing, and Shenzhen) out of the world's top ten most competitive financial centers, which is more than any other country in the 2020 Global Financial Centres Index.[316]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**China** (Chinese: \u4e2d\u56fd; pinyin: *Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3*), officially the **People's Republic of China** (**PRC**),[k] is a country in East Asia. It is the world's second-most-populous country, with a population exceeding 1.4 billion. China spans the equivalent of five time zones and borders fourteen countries by land,[l] tied with Russia as having the most of any country in the world. With an area of nearly 9.6\u00a0million square kilometers (3,700,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), it is the world's third-largest country by total land area.[m] The country is divided into 22 provinces,[n] five autonomous regions, four municipalities, and two semi-autonomous special administrative regions.

Southern China is dominated by hills and low mountain ranges, while the central-east hosts the deltas of China's two major rivers, the Yellow River and the Yangtze River. Other major rivers include the Xi, Mekong, Brahmaputra and Amur. To the west sit major mountain ranges, most notably the Himalayas.

It consists of over 17,000 islands, including Sumatra, Java, Sulawesi, and parts of Borneo and New Guinea. Indonesia is the world's largest archipelagic state and the 14th-largest country by area, at 1,904,569 square kilometres (735,358 square miles). With around 279 million people, Indonesia is the world's fourth-most populous country and the most populous Muslim-majority country. Java, the world's most populous island, is home to more than half of the country's population.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIndonesia lies between latitudes 11\u00b0S and 6\u00b0N and longitudes 95\u00b0E and 141\u00b0E. A transcontinental country spanning Southeast Asia and Oceania, it is the world's largest archipelagic state, extending 5,120 kilometres (3,181\u00a0mi) from east to west and 1,760 kilometres (1,094\u00a0mi) from north to south.[75] The country's Coordinating Ministry for Maritime and Investments Affairs says Indonesia has 17,504 islands (with 16,056 registered at the UN)[76] scattered over both sides of the equator, around 6,000 of which are inhabited.[77] The largest are Sumatra, Java, Borneo (shared with Brunei and Malaysia), Sulawesi, and New Guinea (shared with Papua New Guinea).[78] Indonesia shares land borders with Malaysia on Borneo and Sebatik, Papua New Guinea on the island of New Guinea, East Timor on the island of Timor, and maritime borders with Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam, the Philippines, Palau, and Australia.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNine provinces\u2014Aceh, Jakarta, Yogyakarta, Papua, Central Papua, Highland Papua, South Papua, Southwest Papua and West Papua\u2014are granted a special autonomous status (*otonomi khusus*) from the central government. A conservative Islamic territory, Aceh has the right to create some aspects of an independent legal system implementing *sharia*.[138] Jakarta is the only city with a provincial government due to its position as the capital of Indonesia.[139][140] Yogyakarta is the only pre-colonial monarchy legally recognised within Indonesia, with the positions of governor and vice governor being prioritised for the reigning Sultan of Yogyakarta and Duke of Pakualaman, respectively.[141] The six Papuan provinces are the only ones where the indigenous people have privileges in their local government.[142]\n\n\n\nThis section is transcluded from Template:Indonesia provinces labelled map.

A shared identity has developed with the motto *\"Bhinneka Tunggal Ika\"* (\"Unity in Diversity\" *literally*, \"many, yet one\"), defined by a national language, cultural diversity, religious pluralism within a Muslim-majority population, and a history of colonialism and rebellion against it. The economy of Indonesia is the world's 16th-largest by nominal GDP and the 7th-largest by PPP. It is the world's third-largest democracy, a regional power and is considered a middle power in global affairs. The country is a member of several multilateral organisations, including the United Nations, World Trade Organization, G20, and a founding member of the Non-Aligned Movement, Association of Southeast Asian Nations, East Asia Summit, D-8 and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Names of Indonesia\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* ![](image)Definitions from Wiktionary\n* ![](image)Media from Commons\n* ![](image)News from Wikinews\n* ![](image)Quotations from Wikiquote\n* ![](image)Texts from Wikisource\n* ![](image)Textbooks from Wikibooks\n* ![](image)Resources from Wikiversity\n* ![](image)Travel information from Wikivoyage\n* ![](image)Data from Wikidata\n\n* Indonesia. *The World Factbook*.

Although relations among the diverse population are mostly harmonious, acute sectarian discontent and violence remain problematic in some areas.[73] A political settlement to an armed separatist conflict in Aceh was achieved in 2005.[74]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

It is the world's fifth-most populous country, with a population of 241.5 million people, and has the world's largest Muslim population as of 2023.[10] Islamabad is the nation's capital, while Karachi is its largest city and financial centre, followed by Lahore and Faisalabad. Pakistan is the 33rd-largest country in the world by area and the second largest in South Asia, spanning 881,913 square kilometres (340,509 square miles). It has a 1,046-kilometre (650-mile) coastline along the Arabian Sea and Gulf of Oman in the south, and is bordered by India to the east, Afghanistan to the west, Iran to the southwest, and China to the northeast. It is separated from Tajikistan by Afghanistan's narrow Wakhan Corridor in the north, and also shares a maritime border with Oman.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe name *Pakistan* was coined by Choudhry Rahmat Ali, a Pakistan Movement activist, who in January 1933 first published it (originally as \"Pakstan\") in a pamphlet *Now or Never*, using it as an acronym.[33] Rahmat Ali explained: \"It is composed of letters taken from the names of all our homelands, Indian and Asian, *P*anjab, *A*fghania, *K*ashmir, *S*indh, and Baluchis*tan*.\" He added that \"Pakistan is both a Persian and Urdu word... It means the land of the Paks, the spiritually pure and clean.\"[34] Etymologists note that \u067e\u0627\u06a9 *p\u0101k*, is 'pure' in Persian and Pashto[35] and the Persian suffix \u0640\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 *-stan* means 'land' or 'place of'.[36][37][38][39]\n\n\nRahmat Ali's concept of Pakistan only related to the north-west area of the Indian subcontinent. He also proposed the name \"Banglastan\" for the Muslim areas of Bengal and \"Osmanistan\" for Hyderabad State, as well as a political federation between the three.[40][41]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Pakistan\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)A satellite image showing the topography of Pakistan\nPakistan is divided into three major geographic areas: the northern highlands, the Indus River plain, and the Balochistan Plateau.[162] The northern highlands contain the Karakoram, Hindu Kush, and Pamir mountain ranges (see mountains of Pakistan), which contain some of the world's highest peaks, including five of the fourteen eight-thousanders (mountain peaks over 8,000 metres or 26,250 feet), which attract adventurers and mountaineers from all over the world, notably K2 (8,611\u00a0m or 28,251\u00a0ft) and Nanga Parbat (8,126\u00a0m or 26,660\u00a0ft).[163] The Balochistan Plateau lies in the west and the Thar Desert in the east. The 1,609\u00a0km (1,000\u00a0mi) Indus River and its tributaries flow through the country from the Kashmir region to the Arabian Sea. There is an expanse of alluvial plains along it in the Punjab and Sindh.[164]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA federal parliamentary republic state, Pakistan is a federation that comprises four provinces: Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Sindh and Balochistan,[243] and three territories: Islamabad Capital Territory, Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Kashmir. The Government of Pakistan exercises the *de facto* jurisdiction over the Frontier Regions and the western parts of the Kashmir Regions, which are organised into the separate political entities Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan (formerly Northern Areas). In 2009, the constitutional assignment (the *Gilgit\u2013Baltistan Empowerment and Self-Governance Order*) awarded the Gilgit-Baltistan a semi-provincial status, giving it self-government.[244]\n\n\nThe local government system consists of a three-tier system of districts, tehsils, and union councils, with an elected body at each tier.[245] There are about 130 districts altogether, of which Azad Kashmir has ten[246] and Gilgit-Baltistan seven.[247]\n\n\n\nClickable map of the four provinces and three federal territories of Pakistan.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Government | Federal Islamic parliamentary republic |\n|  |\n| \u2022\u00a0President\n | Arif Alvi |\n| \u2022\u00a0Prime Minister\n | Anwaar ul Haq Kakar (Caretaker) |\n| \u2022\u00a0Chairman of the Senate\n | Sadiq Sanjrani |\n| \u2022\u00a0Speaker of the National Assembly\n | Raja Pervaiz Ashraf |\n| \u2022\u00a0Chief Justice\n | Qazi Faez Isa |\n|  |\n| Legislature | Parliament |\n| \u2022\u00a0Upper house\n | Senate |\n| \u2022\u00a0Lower house\n | National Assembly |\n| Independence\u00a0from the United Kingdom\n |\n|  |\n| \u2022\u00a0Declaration\n | 23 March 1940 |\n| \u2022\u00a0Independence\n | 14 August 1947 |\n| \u2022\u00a0Dominion status terminated\n | 23 March 1956 |\n| \u2022\u00a0Purchase of Gwadar\n | 8 December 1958 |\n| \u2022\u00a0Eastern territory withdrawn\n | 16 December 1971 |\n| \u2022\u00a0Current constitution\n | 14 August 1973 |\n|  |\n| Area  |\n| \u2022\u00a0Total\n | 881,913\u00a0km2 (340,509\u00a0sq\u00a0mi)[b][9] (33rd) |\n| \u2022\u00a0Water\u00a0(%)\n | 2.86 |\n| Population |\n| \u2022\u00a02023\u00a0census\n | 241,499,431[10] |\n| \u2022\u00a0Density\n | 273.8/km2 (709.1/sq\u00a0mi) (56th) |\n| GDP\u00a0(PPP) | 2023\u00a0estimate |\n| \u2022\u00a0Total\n | ![Increase](image) $1.568 trillion[11] (23rd) |\n| \u2022\u00a0Per capita\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPakistan's tourist attractions range from the mangroves in the south to the Himalayan hill stations in the north-east. The country's tourist destinations range from the Buddhist ruins of Takht-i-Bahi and Taxila, to the 5,000-year-old cities of the Indus Valley civilization such as Mohenjo-daro and Harappa.[353] Pakistan is home to several mountain peaks over 7,000 metres (23,000 feet).[354] The northern part of Pakistan has many old fortresses, examples of ancient architecture, and the Hunza and Chitral valleys, home to the small pre-Islamic Kalasha community claiming descent from Alexander the Great.[355] Pakistan's cultural capital, Lahore, contains many examples of Mughal architecture such as the Badshahi Masjid, the Shalimar Gardens, the Tomb of Jahangir, and the Lahore Fort.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | ![Increase](image) $6,773[11] (168th) |\n| GDP\u00a0(nominal) | 2023\u00a0estimate |\n| \u2022\u00a0Total\n | ![Decrease](image) $340.636 billion[11] (42nd) |\n| \u2022\u00a0Per capita\n | ![Decrease](image) $1,471[11] (177th) |\n| Gini\u00a0(2018) | ![Positive decrease](image)\u00a031.6[12]medium |\n| HDI\u00a0(2022) | ![Increase](image)\u00a00.544[13]low\u00a0(161st) |\n| Currency | Pakistani rupee (\u20a8) (PKR) |\n| Time zone | UTC+05:00 (PKT) |\n|  | *DST is not observed* |\n| Date format | * dd-mm-yyyy[c]\n |\n| Driving side | left[14] |\n| Calling code | +92 |\n| ISO 3166 code | PK |\n| Internet TLD | * .pk\n* \u067e\u0627\u06a9\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646.\n |\n\n\n![](image)\n\nYou may need rendering support to display the Urdu text in this article correctly.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Minahan, James (2009). *The Complete Guide to National Symbols and Emblems [2 volumes]*.

The majority of the population in the south resides along the Indus River, with Karachi the most populous commercial city.[475] In the east, west, and north, most of the population lives in an arc formed by the cities of Lahore, Faisalabad, Rawalpindi, Islamabad, Sargodha, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Gujrat, Jhelum, Sheikhupura, Nowshera, Mardan, and Peshawar. During the period 1990\u20132008, city dwellers made up 36% of Pakistan's population, making it the most urbanised nation in South Asia. Furthermore, more than 50% of Pakistanis live in towns of 5,000 people or more.[476] Immigration, from both within and outside the country, is regarded as one of the main factors contributing to urbanisation in Pakistan. One analysis of the 1998 national census highlighted the significance of the partition of India in the 1940s as it relates to urban change in Pakistan.[477]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n126. **^** \"Pakistan: Shehbaz Sharif chosen as PM after week-long uncertainty\".
