The predominant language is Standard Chinese, which is based on Beijingese, but there are hundreds of related Chinese languages, collectively known as *Hanyu* (simplified Chinese: \u6c49\u8bed; traditional Chinese: \u6f22\u8a9e; pinyin: *H\u00e0ny\u01d4*, 'Han language'), that are spoken by 92% of the population. The Chinese (or 'Sinitic') languages are typically divided into seven major language groups, and their study is a distinct academic discipline.[1] They differ as much from each other morphologically and phonetically as do English, German and Danish, but meanwhile share the same writing system (Hanzi) and are mutually intelligible in written form. There are in addition approximately 300 minority languages spoken by the remaining 8% of the population of China.[2] The ones with greatest state support are Mongolian, Tibetan, Uyghur and Zhuang.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Languages of China |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)Distribution of language families in China\n |\n| Official | * Standard Mandarin\n* Cantonese (Hong Kong and Macau)\n* Portuguese (Macau)\n* English (Hong Kong)\n* Mongolian (Inner Mongolia, Haixi in Qinghai, Bayingolin and Bortala in Xinjiang)\n* Korean (Yanbian in Jilin)\n* Standard Tibetan (Tibet, Qinghai)\n* Uyghur (Xinjiang)\n* Zhuang (Guangxi, Wenshan in Yunnan)\n* Kazakh (Ili in Xinjiang)\n* Yi (Liangshan in Sichuan, Chuxiong and Honghe in Yunnan)\n |\n| Signed | * Chinese Sign\n* Hong Kong Sign\n* Tibetan Sign\n |\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Kane, D.

It includes sovereign states, inhabited dependent territories and, in some cases, constituent countries of sovereign states, with inclusion within the list being primarily based on the ISO standard ISO 3166-1. For instance, the United Kingdom is considered a single entity, while the constituent countries of the Kingdom of the Netherlands are considered separately. In addition, this list includes certain states with limited recognition not found in ISO 3166-1.
