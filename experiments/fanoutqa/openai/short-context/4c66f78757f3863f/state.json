The Swedish Academy decides who, if anyone, will receive the prize. The academy announces the name of the laureate in early October. It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the will of Alfred Nobel in 1895. Literature is traditionally the final award presented at the Nobel Prize ceremony. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nLaureates of the Nobel Prize in Literature\n |\n| --- |\n| 1901\u20131920 | * 1901: Sully Prudhomme\n* 1902: Theodor Mommsen\n* 1903: Bj\u00f8rnstjerne Bj\u00f8rnson\n* 1904: Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mistral / Jos\u00e9 Echegaray\n* 1905: Henryk Sienkiewicz\n* 1906: Giosu\u00e8 Carducci\n* 1907: Rudyard Kipling\n* 1908: Rudolf Eucken\n* 1909: Selma Lagerl\u00f6f\n* 1910: Paul Heyse\n* 1911: Maurice Maeterlinck\n* 1912: Gerhart Hauptmann\n* 1913: Rabindranath Tagore\n* 1914\n* 1915: Romain Rolland\n* 1916: Verner von Heidenstam\n* 1917: Karl Gjellerup / Henrik Pontoppidan\n* 1918\n* 1919: Carl Spitteler\n* 1920: Knut Hamsun\n |\n| 1921\u20131940 | * 1921: Anatole France\n* 1922: Jacinto Benavente\n* 1923: W.

Sometimes, however, the award has been announced the year after the nominal year, the latest such case being the 2018 award. In the midst of controversy surrounding claims of sexual assault, conflict of interest, and resignations by officials, on 4 May 2018, the Swedish Academy announced that the 2018 laureate would be announced in 2019 along with the 2019 laureate.[5][4] Some years, such as in 1949, no candidate received the required majority of the votes, and for that reason, the prize was postponed and announced the following year.[26]\n\n\n\n## Prizes[edit]\n\n\nA Literature Nobel Prize laureate receives a gold medal, a diploma bearing a citation, and a sum of money.[27] The amount of money awarded depends on the income of the Nobel Foundation that year.[28] The literature prize can be shared between two, but not three, laureates.[29] If a prize is awarded jointly, the prize money is split equally between them.[30]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThousands of requests are sent out each year, and as of 2011[update] about 220 proposals were returned.[20] These proposals must be received by the Academy by 1 February, after which they are examined by the Nobel Committee, a working group within the Academy comprising four to five members.[21] By April, the committee narrows the field to around 20 candidates.[20] By May, a shortlist of five names is approved by the Academy.[20] The next four months are spent reading and reviewing the works of the five candidates.[20] In October, members of the Academy vote, and the candidate who receives more than half of the votes is named the Nobel laureate in Literature. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Nobel Prize in Literature has been awarded 116 times between 1901 and 2023 to 120 individuals: 103 men and 17 women. The prize has been shared between two individuals on four occasions. It was not awarded on seven occasions. The laureates have included writers in 25 different languages. The youngest laureate was Rudyard Kipling, who was 41 years old when he was awarded in 1907. The oldest laureate to receive the prize was Doris Lessing, who was 88 when she was awarded in 2007. It has been awarded posthumously once, to Erik Axel Karlfeldt in 1931. On some occasions, the awarding institution, the Swedish Academy, has awarded the prize to its own members; Verner von Heidenstam in 1916, the posthumous prize to Karlfeldt in 1931, P\u00e4r Lagerkvist in 1951, and the shared prize to Eyvind Johnson and Harry Martinson in 1974. Selma Lagerl\u00f6f was elected a member of the Swedish Academy in 1914, five years after she was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1909. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n90. **^** Maori writer this year's Neustadt International Prize winner \u2013 *The Norman Transcript*\n91. **^** \"Hans Christian Andersen Award\".

Many authors who have won the prize have fallen into obscurity, while others rejected by the jury remain widely studied and read. In the *Wall Street Journal*, Joseph Epstein wrote, \"You might not know it, but you and I are members of a club whose fellow members include Leo Tolstoy, Henry James, Anton Chekhov, Mark Twain, Henrik Ibsen, Marcel Proust, James Joyce, Jorge Luis Borges and Vladimir Nabokov. The club is the Non-Winners of the Nobel Prize in Literature. All these authentically great writers, still alive when the prize, initiated in 1901, was being awarded, didn't win it.\"[43] Other notable names from the non-western canon who were ignored despite being nominated several times for the prize include Sri Aurobindo and Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n83. **^** L\u00f6fgren, Emma (29 August 2018). \"Four writers shortlisted for 'the new Nobel Literature Prize'\". *The Local*.

However, the Academy has been reluctant to award shared prizes, mainly because divisions are liable to be interpreted as a result of a compromise. The shared prizes awarded to Frederic Mistral and Jos\u00e9 Echegaray in 1904 and to Karl Gjellerup and Henrik Pontoppidan in 1917 were, in fact, both results of compromises. The Academy has also hesitated to divide the prize between two authors, as a shared prize runs the risk of being regarded as only half a laurel. Shared prizes are exceptional, and more recently, the Academy has awarded a shared prize on only two occasions, to Shmuel Yosef Agnon and Nelly Sachs in 1966, and to Eyvind Johnson and Harry Martinson in 1974.[18]\n\n\n\n### Recognition of a specific work[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n### Controversies about Nobel laureate selections[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Nobel Prize controversies \u00a7\u00a0Literature\n\nFrom 1901 to 1912, the committee, led by the conservative Carl David af Wirs\u00e9n, assessed the literary quality of a work in relation to its contribution to humanity's pursuit of the \"ideal.\" Leo Tolstoy, Henrik Ibsen, \u00c9mile Zola, and Mark Twain were rejected in favour of authors who are little read today.[47][49]\n\n\nLater, the prize has often been controversial due to the Swedish Academy's Eurocentric choices of laureates for political reasons, as seen in the years 1970, 2005, and 2019, and for the Academy awarding its own members, as happened in 1974.[50]\n\n\n\n### Nationality-based criticism[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee that were to award the Peace Prize were appointed shortly after the will was approved. The prize-awarding organisations followed: the Karolinska Institutet on 7 June, the Swedish Academy on 9 June, and the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences on 11 June.[14][15] The Nobel Foundation then reached an agreement on guidelines for how the Nobel Prize should be awarded. In 1900, the Nobel Foundation's newly created statutes were promulgated by King Oscar II.[13][16][17] According to Nobel's will, the prize in literature should be determined by \"the Academy in Stockholm\", which was specified by the statutes of the Nobel Foundation to mean the Swedish Academy.[18]\n\n\n\n## Nomination and award procedure[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of nominees for the Nobel Prize in Literature.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n61. **^** Warme, Lars G., ed.

The oldest laureate to receive the prize was Doris Lessing, who was 88 when she was awarded in 2007. It has been awarded posthumously once, to Erik Axel Karlfeldt in 1931.[7] When he received the award in 1958, Russian-born Boris Pasternak was forced to publicly reject the award under pressure from the government of the Soviet Union. In 1964, Jean-Paul Sartre made known that he did not wish to accept the Nobel Prize in Literature,[8] as he had consistently refused all official honors in the past.[9] However the Nobel committee does not acknowledge refusals, and includes Pasternak and Sartre in its list of Nobel laureates.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSeventeen women have been awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, the second highest number of any of the Nobel Prizes behind the Nobel Peace Prize.[11][12] There have been four instances in which the award was given to two people (1904, 1917, 1966, 1974). There have been seven years in which the Nobel Prize in Literature was not awarded (1914, 1918, 1935, 1940\u20131943). There have been three years for which the Nobel Prize in Literature was delayed one year: the prizes for 1915,[13] 1949[14] and 2018[15][16][6] were each awarded together with that of the following year in October of the following year. As of 2022, there have been 29 English-speaking laureates of the Nobel Prize in Literature, followed by French with 16 laureates and German with 14 laureates. France has the highest number of Nobel laureates.\n\n\n\n\n## Laureates[edit]\n\n\n* 1901\n* 1910\n* 1920\n* 1930\n* 1940\n* 1950\n* 1960\n* 1970\n* 1980\n* 1990\n* 2000\n* 2010\n* 2020\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n108. **^** \"Nobel Prize in Literature 2000\".

It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the 1895 will of Alfred Nobel, which are awarded for outstanding contributions in chemistry, physics, literature, peace, and physiology or medicine.[1] As dictated by Nobel's will, the award is administered by the Nobel Foundation and awarded by the Swedish Academy.[2] The first Nobel Prize in Literature was awarded in 1901 to Sully Prudhomme of France.[3] Each recipient receives a medal, a diploma and a monetary award prize that has varied throughout the years.[4] In 1901, Prudhomme received 150,782 SEK, which is equivalent to 8,823,637.78 SEK in January 2018. The award is presented in Stockholm at an annual ceremony on December 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death.[5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n52. **^** \"Nobel Prize in Literature 1939\".

She grew up in a small Canadian town \u2013 Huron County, Ontario \u2013 the kind of environment that often provides the backdrops for her stories. These often accommodate the entire epic complexity of the novel in just a few short pages and the underlying themes of her work are often relationship problems and moral conflicts. The relationship between memory and reality is another recurring theme she uses to create tension. With subtle means, she is able to demonstrate the impact that seemingly trivial events can have on a person's life. Her famous short story collections include *Dance of the Happy Shades* (1969), *Who Do You Think You Are?* (1978), *The Progress of Love* (1986), *The Love of a Good Woman* (1998), and *Runaway* (2004).[6][3]\n\n\n\n## Award ceremony[edit]\n\n\nDue to her health condition and old age, Alice Munro was not able to personally participate in the award ceremony in Stockholm. Mrs. Jenny Munro, her daughter, received the diploma, medal and monetary prize from King Carl XVI Gustaf on her behalf on December 10, 2013.[7]\n\n\n\nPeter Englund, permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, expressed the rightfulness of bestowing Munro the Nobel prize, by saying: \n\n\n> \"The seemingly prosaic surface level in Alice Munro\u2019s short stories is interwoven in an interesting way with her writing style and distinctive storytelling technique. The minimalist style we encounter is clean, transparent, subtle and stunningly precise. It is a challenge to find an unessential word or a superfluous phrase. Reading one of her texts is like watching a cat walk across a laid dinner table. A brief short story can often cover decades, summarising a life, as she moves deftly between different periods. No wonder Alice Munro is often able to say more in 30 pages than an ordinary novelist is capable of in 300. She is a virtuoso of the elliptical and \u2013 as the Academy said in its brief prize citation \u2013 the master of the contemporary short story.\"[7]\n> \n> \n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The Nobel Prize in Literature 2013 nobelprize.org\n2. **^** Saul Bellow, the 1976 laureate, was born in Canada, but he moved to the United States at age nine and became a US citizen at twenty-six.\n3. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Alice Munro britannica.com\n4. **^** \"The Nobel Prize in Literature 2013 \u2013 Press Release\" (PDF). 10 October 2013.

In her books, she uses interviews to create a collage of a wide range of voices. With her \"documentary novels\", Alexievich, who is a journalist, moves in the boundary between reporting and fiction. Her major works includes the *Chernobylskaya molitva* (\"Voices from Chernobyl: The Oral History of a Nuclear Disaster\", 1997) and *U voyny ne zhenskoe litso* (\"The Unwomanly Face of War: An Oral History of Women in World War II\", 1985). Her books criticize political regimes in both the Soviet Union and later Belarus as in *Vremya sekond khend* (\"Secondhand Time: The Last of the Soviets\", 2013).[4][5]\n\n\n\n## \"Documentary Literature\"[edit]\n\n\nAlexievich herself rejects the notion that she is a journalist, and, in fact, Alexievich\u2019s chosen genre is sometimes called \"documentary literature\": an artistic rendering of real events, with a degree of poetic license.[6] In her own words:\n\n\n\n\n> \"I've been searching for a literary method that would allow the closest possible approximation to real life. Reality has always attracted me like a magnet, it tortured and hypnotized me, I wanted to capture it on paper. So I immediately appropriated this genre of actual human voices and confessions, witness evidences and documents. This is how I hear and see the world \u2013 as a chorus of individual voices and a collage of everyday details. This is how my eye and ear function. In this way all my mental and emotional potential is realized to the full. In this way I can be simultaneously a writer, reporter, sociologist, psychologist and preacher.\"\n> \n> \n\n\n## Nobel lecture and award ceremony[edit]\n\n\nAlexievich delivered a Nobel lecture on December 7, 2015 entitled *On the Battle Lost*, which was originally in Russian. In her lecture, she depicted life during and after the Soviet Union through the various experience of individuals based on interviews and creating them into collages of memories.[7]\n\n\nSara Danius, in the presentation of the award, said: \n\n\n\n\n> \"Alexievich uncovers the face of evil in a truth process where 'heat incinerates the lies' and in language that, between the lines, conveys the silence of pain. She waits until the voices lodge in her, acquiring a harder sheen. This makes her the most sensitive of contemporary historians and a genre innovator.\"[8]\n> \n> \n\n\n## Gallery[edit]\n\n\n* **8 October 2015**: Announcement of the 2015 Nobel Prize laureate in Literature in Stockholm by the Permanent Secretary Sara Danius.\n\n\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The Nobel Prize in Literature 2015 nobelprize.org\n2. **^** Svetlana Alexievich wins Nobel Literature prize Archived 2018-06-21 at the Wayback Machine, by BBC\n3. **^** Alison Flood, Luke Harding and agencies (8 October 2015). \"Svetlana Alexievich wins 2015 Nobel prize in literature\". *The Guardian*.

M. G. Le Cl\u00e9zio in 2008.[2]\n\n\n\n\n## Laureate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Patrick Modiano\n\nPatrick Modiano's stories are often characterized by their exploration of universal but difficult questions, at the same time as they are grounded in everyday settings and historical events like in *La Place de l'\u00c9toile* (\"The Place of the Star\", 1968). His works center around subjects like memory, oblivion, identity, and guilt as in *Rue des Boutiques Obscures* (\"Missing Person\", 1978) and *Dora Bruder* (1997). The city of Paris plays a central role in his writing \u2013 *Accident nocturne* (\"Paris Nocturne\", 2003), and his stories are often based on events that occurred during the German occupation of France during World War II. At times, Modiano's stories are based on his own experience or on interviews, newspaper articles, or his own notes. Among his other famous literary works include *Un cirque passe* (\"After the Circus\", 1992), *Quartier Perdu* (\"A Trace of Malice\", 1984), and *L'Herbe des nuits* (\"The Black Notebook\", 2012).[3][2]\n\n\n\n## Reactions[edit]\n\n\nCalled \"a Marcel Proust of our time\",[4] Modiano heard the news via a mobile phone call from his daughter while walking through Paris, \"just next to the Jardin du Luxembourg\" where he lives.[5] The win was unexpected, even to those in the Anglo-American world most familiar with his work.[6][7] The puzzlement was likely related to limited knowledge of Modiano in the English-speaking world; despite his prolific output, fewer than a dozen of his works had been translated into English, and several of those were out of print before the academy's announcement. The award-winning *Missing Person* had sold just 2,425 copies in the US prior to the Nobel.[4] Even Peter Englund, the permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, noted that many people outside France would likely be unfamiliar with Modiano and his work. \"He is well-known in France, but not anywhere else,\" he said in a post-announcement interview.[8] Yale University Press quickly published three of his novels in English.\n\n\n\n## Gallery[edit]\n\n\n* **6 December 2014**: Patrick Modiano during the Swedish Academy's press conference with Peter Englund.\n\n\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The Nobel Prize in Literature 2014 nobelprize.org\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Patrick Modiano\". *Encyclopedia Britannica*.

The Swedish Academy decides who, if anyone, will receive the prize. The academy announces the name of the laureate in early October. It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the will of Alfred Nobel in 1895. Literature is traditionally the final award presented at the Nobel Prize ceremony. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nLaureates of the Nobel Prize in Literature\n |\n| --- |\n| 1901\u20131920 | * 1901: Sully Prudhomme\n* 1902: Theodor Mommsen\n* 1903: Bj\u00f8rnstjerne Bj\u00f8rnson\n* 1904: Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mistral / Jos\u00e9 Echegaray\n* 1905: Henryk Sienkiewicz\n* 1906: Giosu\u00e8 Carducci\n* 1907: Rudyard Kipling\n* 1908: Rudolf Eucken\n* 1909: Selma Lagerl\u00f6f\n* 1910: Paul Heyse\n* 1911: Maurice Maeterlinck\n* 1912: Gerhart Hauptmann\n* 1913: Rabindranath Tagore\n* 1914\n* 1915: Romain Rolland\n* 1916: Verner von Heidenstam\n* 1917: Karl Gjellerup / Henrik Pontoppidan\n* 1918\n* 1919: Carl Spitteler\n* 1920: Knut Hamsun\n |\n| 1921\u20131940 | * 1921: Anatole France\n* 1922: Jacinto Benavente\n* 1923: W.

Sometimes, however, the award has been announced the year after the nominal year, the latest such case being the 2018 award. In the midst of controversy surrounding claims of sexual assault, conflict of interest, and resignations by officials, on 4 May 2018, the Swedish Academy announced that the 2018 laureate would be announced in 2019 along with the 2019 laureate.[5][4] Some years, such as in 1949, no candidate received the required majority of the votes, and for that reason, the prize was postponed and announced the following year.[26]\n\n\n\n## Prizes[edit]\n\n\nA Literature Nobel Prize laureate receives a gold medal, a diploma bearing a citation, and a sum of money.[27] The amount of money awarded depends on the income of the Nobel Foundation that year.[28] The literature prize can be shared between two, but not three, laureates.[29] If a prize is awarded jointly, the prize money is split equally between them.[30]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Nobel Prize in Literature has been awarded 116 times between 1901 and 2023 to 120 individuals: 103 men and 17 women. The prize has been shared between two individuals on four occasions. It was not awarded on seven occasions. The laureates have included writers in 25 different languages. The youngest laureate was Rudyard Kipling, who was 41 years old when he was awarded in 1907. The oldest laureate to receive the prize was Doris Lessing, who was 88 when she was awarded in 2007. It has been awarded posthumously once, to Erik Axel Karlfeldt in 1931. On some occasions, the awarding institution, the Swedish Academy, has awarded the prize to its own members; Verner von Heidenstam in 1916, the posthumous prize to Karlfeldt in 1931, P\u00e4r Lagerkvist in 1951, and the shared prize to Eyvind Johnson and Harry Martinson in 1974. Selma Lagerl\u00f6f was elected a member of the Swedish Academy in 1914, five years after she was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1909. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n83. **^** L\u00f6fgren, Emma (29 August 2018). \"Four writers shortlisted for 'the new Nobel Literature Prize'\". *The Local*.

Many authors who have won the prize have fallen into obscurity, while others rejected by the jury remain widely studied and read. In the *Wall Street Journal*, Joseph Epstein wrote, \"You might not know it, but you and I are members of a club whose fellow members include Leo Tolstoy, Henry James, Anton Chekhov, Mark Twain, Henrik Ibsen, Marcel Proust, James Joyce, Jorge Luis Borges and Vladimir Nabokov. The club is the Non-Winners of the Nobel Prize in Literature. All these authentically great writers, still alive when the prize, initiated in 1901, was being awarded, didn't win it.\"[43] Other notable names from the non-western canon who were ignored despite being nominated several times for the prize include Sri Aurobindo and Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n52. **^** Kirsch, Adam (3 October 2008). \"The Nobel Committee has no clue about American literature\". *Slate*.

Each diploma is uniquely designed by the prize-awarding institutions for the laureate who receives it.[37] The diploma contains a picture and text that states the name of the laureate and normally a citation of why they received the prize.[37]\n\n\n\n## Laureates[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of Nobel laureates in Literature.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nEach year, the Swedish Academy sends out requests for nominations of candidates for the Nobel Prize in Literature. Members of the Academy, members of literature academies and societies, professors of literature and language, former Nobel literature laureates, and the presidents of writers' organisations are all allowed to nominate a candidate. It is not allowed to nominate oneself.[19]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee that were to award the Peace Prize were appointed shortly after the will was approved. The prize-awarding organisations followed: the Karolinska Institutet on 7 June, the Swedish Academy on 9 June, and the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences on 11 June.[14][15] The Nobel Foundation then reached an agreement on guidelines for how the Nobel Prize should be awarded. In 1900, the Nobel Foundation's newly created statutes were promulgated by King Oscar II.[13][16][17] According to Nobel's will, the prize in literature should be determined by \"the Academy in Stockholm\", which was specified by the statutes of the Nobel Foundation to mean the Swedish Academy.[18]\n\n\n\n## Nomination and award procedure[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of nominees for the Nobel Prize in Literature.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThere are also prizes for honouring the lifetime achievement of writers in specific languages, like the Miguel de Cervantes Prize (for Spanish language, established in 1976) and the Cam\u00f5es Prize (for Portuguese language, established in 1989). Nobel laureates who were also awarded the Miguel de Cervantes Prize include Octavio Paz (1981 Cervantes, 1990 Nobel); Mario Vargas Llosa (1994 Cervantes, 2010 Nobel); and Camilo Jos\u00e9 Cela (1995 Cervantes, 1989 Nobel). Jos\u00e9 Saramago is the only author to receive both the Cam\u00f5es Prize (1995) and the Nobel Prize (1998) to date.\n\n\nThe Hans Christian Andersen Award is sometimes referred to as \"the Little Nobel\". The award has earned this appellation since, in a similar manner to the Nobel Prize in Literature, it recognises the lifetime achievement of writers, though the Andersen Award focuses on a single category of literary works (children's literature).[91]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the 1895 will of Alfred Nobel, which are awarded for outstanding contributions in chemistry, physics, literature, peace, and physiology or medicine.[1] As dictated by Nobel's will, the award is administered by the Nobel Foundation and awarded by the Swedish Academy.[2] The first Nobel Prize in Literature was awarded in 1901 to Sully Prudhomme of France.[3] Each recipient receives a medal, a diploma and a monetary award prize that has varied throughout the years.[4] In 1901, Prudhomme received 150,782 SEK, which is equivalent to 8,823,637.78 SEK in January 2018. The award is presented in Stockholm at an annual ceremony on December 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death.[5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1Rabindranath Tagore (Nobel Prize in Literature 1913) wrote in Bengali and English, Samuel Beckett (Nobel Prize in Literature 1969) wrote in French and English and Joseph Brodsky (Nobel Prize in Literature 1987) wrote poetry in Russian and prose in English. These three Nobel laureates have been sorted under Bengali, French and Russian, respectively.[132]\n\n\n2Karl Adolph Gjellerup (Nobel Prize in Literature 1917) wrote in Danish and German.\n\n\n\n## Nobel laureates by sex[edit]\n\n\nThe 120 Nobel laureates in literature from 1901 to 2023 were from the following sexes:\n\n\n\n\n\n| **Decade** | **Male** | **Female** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1900\u20131909\n | 9\n | 1\n |\n| 1910\u20131919\n | 9\n | 0\n |\n| 1920\u20131929\n | 8\n | 2\n |\n| 1930\u20131939\n | 8\n | 1\n |\n| 1940\u20131949\n | 5\n | 1\n |\n| 1950\u20131959\n | 10\n | 0\n |\n| 1960\u20131969\n | 10\n | 1\n |\n| 1970\u20131979\n | 11\n | 0\n |\n| 1980\u20131989\n | 10\n | 0\n |\n| 1990\u20131999\n | 7\n | 3\n |\n| 2000\u20132009\n | 7\n | 3\n |\n| 2010\u20132019\n | 7\n | 3\n |\n| 2020\u20132029\n | 2\n | 2\n |\n| **Total** | 103\n | 17\n |\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n14. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Nobel Prize in Literature 1949\".
