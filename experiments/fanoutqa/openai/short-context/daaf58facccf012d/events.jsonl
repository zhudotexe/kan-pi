More recently, the channel's overseas viewership has increased further, as a result of attention and controversy drawn to the channel by foreign YouTubers such as PewDiePie and MrBeast.[2] On 22 February 2019 at 6:04 AM, T-Series surpassed PewDiePie for the first time to become the most-subscribed YouTube channel, with PewDiePie regaining the spot 8 minutes later. T-Series overtook PewDiePie in a similar manner many more times over the following weeks, and on 27 March, finally gained and maintained, until 1 April, the top spot by a fluctuating, but overall growing, margin.[69][70]\n\n\n\n## Legal issues[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn top of this, seven of their channels are among the top 100 most-subscribed channels in India, including T-Series, Bhakti Sagar, Apna Punjab, Pop Chartbusters, Bollywood Classics, T-Series Regional, Lahari Music.[58]\n\n\nT-Series' 29 channels accumulated a total of more than 184 million YouTube subscribers as of July 2019. During January–July 2018, T-Series earned an income of ₹720 crore (equivalent to ₹895 crore or US$110 million in 2023) from YouTube.[56] Online revenue contributes to at least 60% of the company's overall revenue.[59]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn YouTube, T-Series has a multi-channel network, with 30 channels (including Lahari Music) that have over 382.3 million subscribers as of 15 December 2021. The company's YouTube team consists of 13 people at the T-Series headquarters.[12] The company's main T-Series channel on YouTube primarily shows music videos as well as film trailers. It became the most-viewed YouTube channel in January 2017.[13] The T-Series channel primarily features content in the Hindi language, and occasionally several other languages including Bhojpuri, Punjabi and English. T-Series also have other channels dedicated to content in several Indian languages including Bengali, Bhojpuri, Punjabi, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Kannada, Gujarati, Marathi and Rajasthani.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n12. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Biswas, Soutik (20 December 2018). \"PewDiePie v T-Series: The battle to be king of YouTube\". *BBC News*.

India currently has 500 million Internet users and this number is expected to grow rapidly.[67] A major breakthrough in India's Internet growth came in September 2016 with the advent of 4G network Reliance Jio, offering data at very low costs.[15] India has since emerged as the world's second-largest online population (behind China, where YouTube is blocked), with YouTube alone having over 225 million monthly Indian users. India's high demand for YouTube content and the lack of local content creators has contributed significantly to the rapid growth of T-Series.[68]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSuper Cassette Industries Private Limited| ![](image) |\n| Trade name\n | T-Series |\n| Company type | Private |\n| Industry | Music & entertainment |\n| Founded | 11 July 1983; 40 years ago (1983-07-11) in Delhi, India[1] |\n| Founder | Gulshan Kumar |\n| Headquarters | Mumbai\n, India\n |\n| Key people\n | Bhushan Kumar(Chairman, Managing Director)Krishan Kumar Neeraj Kalyan(President)[2] |\n| Services | * Music record label\n* Film production\n |\n| Owner | * Gulshan Kumar (1983–1997)\n* Bhushan Kumar (1997–present)\n |\n| **YouTube information**\n |\n| Channel | * T-Series\n |\n| Years active | 2006–present |\n| Genres | * Music videos\n* Film trailers\n |\n| Subscribers | 252 million[3] |\n| Total views | 236.8 billion[3] |\n| \n\n| Creator Awards\n |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) | 100,000 subscribers | 2011 |\n| ![](image) | 1,000,000 subscribers | 2013 |\n| ![](image) | 10,000,000 subscribers | 2016 |\n| ![](image) | 50,000,000 subscribers | 2018 |\n| ![](image) | 100,000,000 subscribers | 2019 |\n\n |\n| \n\n---\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs a film production company, T-Series has had some moderate success.

Then known as \"checkgate\",[5] the channel uploaded two versions of the alphabet song to YouTube on their first day.[6] The channel uploaded their third video 9 months later, titled \"Learning ABC Alphabet – Letter \"K\" — Kangaroo Game\". Most videos on the channel taught the alphabet, with a typical length of between one and two minutes.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIt was predicted Cocomelon would surpass PewDiePie at some point in April–May 2021, becoming the second-most subscribed YouTube channel.[26][27][28] In response to this, PewDiePie released \"Coco,\" a diss track targeted at Cocomelon on February 14, 2021. The video was removed from YouTube shortly after its upload. YouTube cited its harassment and cyberbullying policy as the reason for the video being taken down.[29][30] Two months later, on April 25, 2021, Cocomelon surpassed PewDiePie as predicted. The song remains on major streaming platforms.\n\n\nCocomelon has been involved in the Riyadh Season 2021 show in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, where the companies Spacetoon Event and Moonbug Entertainment collaborated with the Saudi General Entertainment Authority to bring the Cocomelon Town show for 3 months.[31][32]\n\n\nOn September 28, 2023, Netflix released a teaser for a new original series based on the franchise titled *Cocomelon Lane*.

The logo showed a TV with a ladybug in the upper left corner. The channel began remastering older videos, followed by a transition from alphabet videos to nursery rhymes and longer video lengths. Within a few years, the channel introduced computer animation, with their first 3D character being used in *Twinkle Twinkle Little Star* on April 8, 2016. The video featured a 3D flying star guiding 2D characters through the sky. Towards the end of 2016, 3D animation video uploads became more frequent and longer, with some videos using motion capture technology. Animation and music production continued to modernize, and a recurring cast of characters formed before the 2018 rebrand.
