Seven people including only one Republican have served as a U.S. senator from Hawaii. The state's current U.S. senators are Democrats Brian Schatz and Mazie Hirono. Hawaii's class 1 seat is the only one in the United States that has always been held by an ethnic minority.[*citation needed*] Its class 3 seat is the only one in the United States that has always been held by a member of the Democratic Party.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nHawaii last elected a Republican in 1970, which has resulted in the longest streak in the nation for a state's having all-Democratic senators. Daniel K. Inouye was Hawaii's longest-serving senator, from 1963 to 2012.\n\n\n\n## List of senators[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | Democratic | ![](image)**Brian Schatz** | 3\n |\n| 4\n | ![](image)**Mazie Hirono** | Democratic | Jan 3, 2013 \u2013present\n | Elected in 2012.\n | 10\n | 113th |\n| 114th |\n| 115th | 11\n | Re-elected in 2016.\n |\n| Re-elected in 2018.\n | 11\n | 116th |\n| 117th |\n| 118th | 12\n | Re-elected in 2022.\n |\n| To be determined in the 2024 election.\n | 12\n | 119th |\n| 120th |\n| 121st | 13\n | To be determined in the 2028 election.\n |\n| #\n | Senator\n | Party\n | Years in office\n | Electoral history\n | T | C | T | Electoral history\n | Years in office\n | Party\n | Senator\n | #\n |\n|  Class 1 |  Class 3 |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Hawaii portal\n* ![flag](image)United States portal\n* ![icon](image)Politics portal\n\n\n* List of United States representatives from Hawaii\n* United States congressional delegations from Hawaii\n* Elections in Hawaii\n\n\n## External links[edit]\n\n\n* Members of Congress from Hawaii, govtrack.us\n* U.S. Senate members from Hawaii, civil.services\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  **Class 1**Class 1 U.S. senators belong to the electoral cycle that has recently been contested in 2000, 2006, 2012, and 2018.
