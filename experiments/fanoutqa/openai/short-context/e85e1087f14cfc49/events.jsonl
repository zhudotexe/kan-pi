Atomic physics, particle physics, cell biology, and neuroscience dominated the two subjects outside chemistry, while molecular chemistry was the chief prize-winning discipline in its domain. Molecular chemists won 5.3% of all science Nobel Prizes during this period.[28]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of Nobel laureates in Chemistry\n* Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize\n* List of chemistry awards\n* List of Nobel laureates\n* Nobel laureates by country\n* Priestley Medal\n* Wolf Prize in Chemistry\n* List of female nominees for the Nobel Prize\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe **Nobel Prize in Chemistry** (Swedish: *Nobelpriset i kemi*) is awarded annually by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences to scientists in the various fields of chemistry. It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the will of Alfred Nobel in 1895, awarded for outstanding contributions in chemistry, physics, literature, peace, and physiology or medicine. This award is administered by the Nobel Foundation, and awarded by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences on proposal of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry which consists of five members elected by the Academy. The award is presented in Stockholm at an annual ceremony on 10 December, the anniversary of Nobel's death.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn recent years, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry has drawn criticism from chemists who feel that the prize is more frequently awarded to non-chemists than to chemists.[26] In the 30 years leading up to 2012, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded ten times for work classified as biochemistry or molecular biology, and once to a materials scientist. In the ten years leading up to 2012, only four prizes were awarded for work strictly in chemistry.[26] Commenting on the scope of the award, *The Economist* explained that the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences is bound by Nobel's bequest, which specifies awards only in physics, chemistry, literature, medicine, and peace. Biology was in its infancy in Nobel's day and no award was established. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOne of the five Nobel Prizes established in 1895 by Alfred Nobel\n\nFor a list of laureates, see List of Nobel laureates in Chemistry.\n\nAward\n\n\n| Nobel Prize in Chemistry |\n| --- |\n| ![A golden medallion with an embossed image of a bearded man facing left in profile.

They would later receive a medal and diploma, but not the money. Frederick Sanger is one out of three laureates to be awarded the Nobel Prize twice in the same subject, in 1958 and 1980. John Bardeen, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1956 and 1972, and Karl Barry Sharpless, who won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 2001 and 2022, are the others. Two others have won Nobel Prizes twice, one in chemistry and one in another subject: Maria Skłodowska-Curie (physics in 1903, chemistry in 1911) and Linus Pauling (chemistry in 1954, peace in 1962).[6] As of 2022, the prize has been awarded to 189 individuals, including eight women (Maria Skłodowska-Curie being the first to be awarded in 1911).[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n55. **^** \"The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1955\".

For the first year of her Ph.D. coursework, the graduate committee at UC Berkeley required that she take undergraduate chemistry courses.[8]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Frances Arnold\n |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) |\n|  |\n| Co-Chair of the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology |\n| **Incumbent**\n |\n| **Assumed office** January 20, 2021Serving with Maria Zuber and Francis Collins\n |\n| President | Joe Biden |\n| Preceded by | Position established |\n|  |\n| Personal details |\n| Born | Frances Hamilton Arnold\n (1956-07-25) July 25, 1956 (age 67)Edgewood, Pennsylvania, U.S. |\n| Spouse | \nJay Bailey\n ​\n(divorced)​\n (1987–1991) |\n| Domestic partner | Andrew E.

She coined the term \"bioorthogonal chemistry\"[2] for chemical reactions compatible with living systems. Her recent efforts include synthesis of chemical tools to study cell surface sugars called glycans and how they affect diseases such as cancer, inflammation, and viral infections like COVID-19.[3] At Stanford University, she holds the Anne T. and Robert M.

Because their father was a physics professor, when asked what she and her sisters wanted to be when they grew up, the answer was unanimous: a nuclear physicist. The three girls would attend MIT camps, as their father dreamt that they would attend MIT due to a \"mixture of pride and the promise of free tuition.\" To William's dismay, Carolyn attended Harvard instead because the school offered strengths outside of just science.[23]\n\n\nBertozzi briefly considered a career in music. In high school, she won several awards for music compositions and musical accomplishments. Her talent on the keyboard earned her offers as a music major from several university rock bands, but she felt that she was \"always centered on the sciences\".[23] Bertozzi is a lesbian and has been out since the late 1980s.[91]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Prescher, Jennifer Ann (2006). *Probing Glycosylation in Living Animals with Bioorthogonal Chemistries* (PhD thesis).

She is a member of the National Academy of Sciences (2005), the Institute of Medicine (2011), and the National Academy of Inventors (2013). In 2014, it was announced that Bertozzi would lead *ACS Central Science*, the American Chemical Society's first peer-reviewed open access journal, which offers all content free to the public.[8] Since 2021 she has been a member of the Accademia dei Lincei.[9]\nAs an open lesbian in academia and science, Bertozzi has been a role model for students and colleagues.[10][11]\n\n\nBertozzi was awarded the 2022 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, jointly with Morten P.

During Bertozzi's third year of graduate school, Bednarski was diagnosed with colon cancer, which resulted in him taking a leave of absence and changing his career path by enrolling in medical school. This left Bertozzi and the rest of the lab to complete their Ph.D. work with no direct supervision.[21][22]\n\n\n\n## Career and research[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n32. **^** \"Carolyn R.

They settled in Jerusalem and ran a grocery, but found it difficult to make ends meet. They lived in cramped quarters with several other families, and Yonath remembers \"books\" being the only thing she had to keep her occupied.[8] Despite their poverty, her parents sent her to school in the upscale Beit HaKerem neighborhood to assure her a good education. When her father died at the age of 42, the family moved to Tel Aviv.[9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 1993 she visualized the path taken by the nascent proteins, namely the ribosomal tunnel, and recently revealed the dynamics elements enabling its involvement in elongation arrest, gating, intra-cellular regulation and nascent chain trafficking into their folding space.\n\n\nAdditionally, Yonath elucidated the modes of action of over twenty different antibiotics targeting the ribosome, illuminated mechanisms of drug resistance and synergism, deciphered the structural basis for antibiotic selectivity and showed how it plays a key role in clinical usefulness and therapeutic effectiveness, thus paving the way for structure-based drug design.\n\n\nFor enabling ribosomal crystallography Yonath introduced a novel technique, cryo bio-crystallography, which became routine in structural biology and allowed intricate projects otherwise considered formidable.[21]\n\n\nAt the Weizmann Institute, Yonath is the incumbent of the Martin S. and Helen Kimmel Professorial Chair.\n\n\n\n## Political Views[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n13. **^** \"(IUCr) European Crystallography Prize\". *Journal of Applied Crystallography*. **33** (4): 1195.

She was working with Bernal on the technique's first application to the analysis of a biological substance, pepsin.[30] The pepsin experiment is largely credited to Hodgkin, however she always made it clear that it was Bernal who initially took the photographs and gave her additional key insights.[31] Her PhD was awarded in 1937 for research on X-ray crystallography and the chemistry of sterols.[2]\n\n\n\n## Career and discoveries[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Watch a lecture of Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin (1910–1994) at the 1988 Nobel Laureates Symposium at the annual meeting of the American Crystallographic Association, Philadelphia\n* Dorothy Hodgkin featured on the BBC Radio 4 program In Our Time on 3 October 2019.\n* \"The exceptional life of Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin\", BBC \"Ideas\" video, 27 September 2021\n\n\n\n\n| Academic offices\n |\n| --- |\n| Preceded byThe Duke of Beaufort\n |  **Chancellor of the University of Bristol** 1970–1988\n | Succeeded bySir Jeremy Morse\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHodgkin developed a passion for chemistry from a young age, and her mother, a proficient botanist, fostered her interest in the sciences.

These institutions often offer degrees at various levels, usually divided into undergraduate and postgraduate degrees. The most common undergraduate degree is the bachelor's degree, although some educational systems offer lower-level undergraduate degrees such as associate and foundation degrees. Common postgraduate degrees include master's degrees and doctorates.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nLevels of academic degree\n |\n| --- |\n| Undergraduate | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ISCED level 5 | * Associate degree\n* Foundation degree\n* Higher National Diploma/​Diploma of Higher Education/​Certificate of Higher Education\n |\n| ISCED level 6 | * Bachelor's degree\n* Honours degree\n |\n\n |\n| Postgraduate | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ISCED level 7 | * Master's degree\n* Postgraduate diploma/​certificate\n* Diplom degree\n* Engineer's degree\n |\n| ISCED level 8 | * Doctorate\n* Candidate of Sciences\n |\n\n |\n| Other | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Postdoctoral | * Higher doctorate\n* Doctor of Sciences\n* Habilitation\n* Docent\n* Tenure\n* Fellow\n |\n| No dominantclassification | * Academic certificate\n* Artist diploma\n* External degree\n* Laurea\n* Licentiate\n* Magister degree\n* Microdegree\n* Professional degree\n* Graduate diploma/​certificate\n* Higher diploma\n* Specialist degree/​diploma\n* Terminal degree\n |\n| Unearned | * Honorary degree\n* *Ad eundem* degree\n* Master of Arts (Oxford, Cambridge, and Dublin)\n |\n\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDepending on the culture and the purpose of the listing, only the highest degree, a selection of degrees, or all degrees might be listed. The awarding institution may be shown and it might be specified if a degree was at honours level, particularly where the honours degree is a separate qualification from the ordinary bachelor's degree.[22]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)The newly conferred bachelor's degree holders after graduation at King's College London, one of the founding colleges of the University of London\nAn academic degree is protected under UK law. All valid UK degrees are awarded by universities or other degree-awarding bodies whose powers to do so are recognised by the UK government; hence they are known as \"recognised bodies\".[110]\n\n\nThe standard first degree in England, Northern Ireland and Wales is the bachelor's degree conferred with honours. Usually this is a Bachelor of Arts (BA) or a Bachelor of Science (BSc) degree. Other variants exist: for example, Bachelor of Education or Bachelor of Laws. It usually takes three years to read for a bachelor's degree.\n\n\nThe honours are usually categorised into four classes:\n\n\n\n* First class honours (1st).\n* Second class honours, divided into:\n\t+ Upper division or upper second (2:1).\n\t+ Lower division or lower second (2:2).\n* Third class honours (3rd).[111]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAmong educational institutions, St David's College, Lampeter, was granted limited degree awarding powers by royal charter in the nineteenth century, despite not being a university. The University College of North Staffordshire was also granted degree awarding powers on its foundation in 1949, despite not becoming a university (as the University of Keele) until 1962. Following the Education Reform Act 1988, many educational institutions other than universities have been granted degree-awarding powers, including higher education colleges and colleges of the University of London, many of which are now effectively universities in their own right.[16]\n\n\n\n### Academic dress[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Academic dress\n\nIn many countries, gaining an academic degree entitles the holder to assume distinctive academic dress particular to the awarding institution, identifying the status of the individual wearing them.\n\n\n\n## Laws on granting and use of degrees[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Unaccredited institutions of higher education\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSome doctorates, such as the Doctor of Clinical Psychology (DClinPsy) qualification, confirm competence to practice in particular professions. There are also higher doctorates – Doctor of Science (DSc) and Doctor of Letters/Literature (DLitt) — that are typically awarded to experienced academics who have demonstrated a high level of achievement in their academic career; for example, they may have published widely on their subject or become professors in their fields.\n\n\nUK post-secondary qualifications are defined at different levels, with levels 1–3 denoting further education and levels 4–8 denoting higher education. Within this structure, a foundation degree is at level 5; a bachelor's degree at level 6; a master's degree at level 7; and a doctoral degree at level 8.[116] Full information about the expectations for different types of UK degrees is published by the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education.[117]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n28. **^** \"New designation for University of Malta degrees\". *Times of Malta*. 23 January 2012.
