The company was founded in Charlotte, North Carolina, in 1977 by Jack Fulk and Richard Thomas.[3]\n\n\nBojangles has locations in Honduras and previously franchised restaurants in Grand Cayman Island, Jamaica, Mexico, Ireland[4] and China.[5][6] As of 2023[update], restaurants are in 17 U.S. states[7] (Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and West Virginia) with planned expansions into New Jersey.[8] Its home state of North Carolina has the largest number of locations.[9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBojangles was purchased again in 2007 by Falfurrias Capital Partners,[14] a private equity firm. The first airport location was opened in 2008 at the Charlotte Douglas International Airport. In August 2011, Falfurrias sold Bojangles to Boston-based Advent International, another private equity firm, after a competitive bidding process with other investors.[15]\n\n\n\n![](image)Advertisement for Bojangles' at Durham Athletic Park in Durham, North Carolina (1989)\nIn 2012, Bojangles began sponsoring the NASCAR race Bojangles' Southern 500, and opened another college campus restaurant at UNC Greensboro.[16]\n\n\nThe company's 600th restaurant opened on July 8, 2014, on Galleria Road in Charlotte with Charlotte mayor Dan Clodfelter cutting the celebratory ribbon.[17]\n\n\nIn April 2015, the company filed with the US regulator for an initial public offering of its common stock, expecting to raise $372 million.[18]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"All Bojangles' Locations | Famous Chicken 'n Biscuits\". *Bojangles*.

Part of this growth was fueled by acquisitions including the Florida-based Biscuits chain.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n13. **^** \"Chicken Franchise Spreads Its Wings\". *Greater Charlotte Biz*.

Franchise fees range between US$10,000 \u2013 $1,000,000 and the ongoing royalty rate varies.[117] 7-Eleven America has its headquarters in the Cypress Waters development in Irving, Texas.[118][119] Small-size Slurpees are free on \"7-Eleven Day\", on July 11.

It was named **Tote'm Stores** between 1928 and 1946. After Ito-Yokado, a Japanese supermarket chain and the parent company of Seven-Eleven Japan, acquired a 70% stake in the company in 1991, the company became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Seven-Eleven Japan in November, 2005.[4][5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n119. **^** \"7-Eleven's new Irving corporate headquarters campus gets $41.5M loan \u2013 Dallas Business Journal\".

Some stores featured \"native\" totem poles in front of the store. In 1946, the chain's name was changed from \"Tote'm\" to \"7-Eleven\" to reflect the company's new, extended hours, 7:00\u00a0a.m. to 11:00\u00a0p.m., seven days per week.[6] In November 1999, the corporate name of the US company was changed from \"The Southland Corporation\" to \"7-Eleven Inc.\"[7][8]\n\n\nFollowing 7-Eleven's adoption of its current logo in 1968, a lowercase *n* was used in the logo because the first wife of John P. Thompson Sr., the company's president during the 1960s,[9] thought the all-capitals version seemed a little aggressive. She suggested the change \"to make the logo look more graceful\".[10]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n7-Eleven operates, franchises, and licenses 78,029 stores in 19 countries and territories as of November 2021. While operating under its namesake brand globally, within the United States it operates as 7-Eleven nationally, as Speedway nationally but mostly in the Midwest & East Coast, and as Stripes Convenience Stores within the South Central United States; both Speedway and Stripes operate alongside 7-Eleven's namesake stores in several markets. 7-Eleven also operates A-Plus locations with the name licensed from owner and fellow Metroplex-based Energy Transfer Partners, though most of these stores have since been rebranded as standard 7-Eleven stores.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymologies[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1946, in an effort to continue the company's post-war recovery, the name of the franchise was changed to 7-Eleven to reflect the stores' new hours of operation (7\u00a0am to 11\u00a0pm), which were unprecedented at the time. In 1963, 7-Eleven experimented with a 24-hour schedule in Austin, Texas, after an Austin store stayed open all night to satisfy customer demand.[6] Later on, 24-hour stores were established in Fort Worth and Dallas, Texas, as well as Las Vegas, Nevada.[13] In 1971, Southland acquired convenience stores of the former Pak-A-Sak chain owned by Graham Allen Penniman Sr. (1903\u20131985), of Shreveport, Louisiana.[14][15]\n\n\nWith the purchase in 1963 of 126 Speedee Mart (all already open 7\u201311) franchised convenience stores in California, the company entered the franchise business. The company signed its first area licensing agreement in 1968 with Garb-Ko, Inc. of Saginaw, Michigan, which became the first U.S. domestic area 7-Eleven licensee.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n107. **^** \"7-Eleven set to enter UK convenience market \u2013 Convenience Shop\". *Conveniencestore.co.uk*.

The first shop opened in Sydenham, South East London in 1985. The United Kingdom had 57 7-Eleven stores when it was sold to Budgens in October 1997.[105][106] The company announced in 2014 they had planned to return to the UK market,[107] but this did not progress beyond its announcement. In 2019, the company announced again it had planned to return, but as of October 2022 no stores had been opened.[105]\n\n\n\n### North America[edit]\n\n\n#### Canada[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn March 2016, 7-Eleven acquired 148 Imperial Oil-owned Esso gas stations in Alberta and British Columbia for C$2.8\u00a0billion. Most of their convenience stores were converted to 7-Eleven stores, and they remain supplied by Esso. Some locations were not converted to 7-Eleven; these locations operate under the transitional banner \"smartstop 24/7\" with their existing store formats, typically inherited from the previous On the Run chain.[113][114]\n\n\n\n#### Mexico[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A 7-Eleven store in Canc\u00fan, Quintana Roo, Mexico\nIn Mexico, the first 7-Eleven store opened in 1976 in Monterrey in association with Grupo Chapa (now Iconn) and 7-Eleven, Inc. under the name Super 7. In 1995, Super 7 was renamed to 7-Eleven, which now has 1,835 stores in several areas of the country. When stores are located within classically designed buildings (such as in Centro Hist\u00f3rico buildings) or important landmarks, the storefront logo is displayed in monochrome with gold or silver lettering.\n\n\n\n#### United States[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAlso in 2010, the first \"green\" 7-Eleven store opened in DeLand, Florida. The store features U.S. Green Building Council's (USGBC) Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) elements. Also, the environmentally friendly design brings the store savings in energy costs. That same year, 7-Eleven went mobile with the launch of the Slurpee drink's iPhone and Android Application (App). The Slurpee drink app made it easy to find 7-Eleven stores and provides driving directions. The following year, 7-Eleven celebrated its 40,000th store opening and within two years of that milestone opened its 60,000th store.\n\n\nIn 2020, 7-Eleven announced it would purchase Speedway for $21\u00a0billion.[26]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n24. **^** \"Japanese Firms Pull Southland Corp.

Its first store, located at the corner of EDSA and Kamias Road in Quezon City, opened on February 29, 1984. On May 2, 1996, the stockholders of both PSC and PSPC approved the merger of the two companies to advance PSC group's expansion. On October 30, 1996, Securities and Exchange Commission approved the merger and PSPC was then absorbed by PSC as the surviving entity. In 2000, President Chain Store Corporation (PCSC) of Taiwan, also a licensee of 7-Eleven, purchased the majority shares of PSC and thus formed a strategic alliance for the convenience store industry within the area.\n\n\nIn February 2009, 7-Eleven has signed a non-exclusive contract with Chevron Philippines to open its stores in selected Caltex gas stations nationwide.[77]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSouthland exited bankruptcy in March 1991, after a cash infusion of $430\u00a0million from Ito-Yokado and Seven-Eleven Japan. These two Japanese entities now controlled 70% of the company, with the founding Thompson family retaining 5 percent.[24] In 1999, Southland Corp. changed its name to 7-Eleven, Inc., citing the divestment of operations other than 7-Eleven.[25] In 2005, Seven-Eleven Japan made a tender offer and 7-Eleven, Inc. became its wholly owned subsidiary.[5] In 2007, Seven & i Holdings announced that it would be expanding its U.S. operations, with an additional 1,000 7-Eleven stores in the U.S.\n\n\nFor the 2010 rankings, 7-Eleven climbed to the No.\u00a03 spot in *Entrepreneur* magazine's 31st Annual Franchise\u00a0500, \"the first and most comprehensive ranking in the world\". This was the 17th year 7-Eleven was named in the top\u00a010.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFurther information: Seven-Eleven Japan\n![](image)Japan's first 7-Eleven store in K\u014dt\u014d, Tokyo opened in May 1974\nJapan has more 7-Eleven locations than anywhere else in the world, where they often bear the name of its holding company Seven & i Holdings.

The stores sell custom food, beverages and convenience store items, with all locations having offered 24/7 service[4] since the 1980s. Nearly all of them sell gasoline; a few locations are full-scale truck stops, including showers and a laundromat. Sheetz's headquarters is in Altoona, Pennsylvania,[5] with their corporate offices located there as well, with over 700 stores located in Central and Western Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Maryland, Ohio, Virginia, and North Carolina, with plans to expand into Michigan.[6]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

Sheetz actively promoted the film in stores, including selling collector cups, and Altoona even temporarily changed its name to \"POM Wonderful Presents: The Greatest Movie Ever Sold, Pennsylvania\" for $25,000. The name change was merely ceremonial, as it was not legally changed by the United States Board of Geographic Names, nor was it recognized by the United States Postal Service.[12]\n\n\n\n### 2013\u2013present[edit]\n\n\nStan Sheetz became chairman of the board of Sheetz in October 2013, with his cousin Joseph S. \"Joe\" Sheetz becoming president and CEO.[13]\n\n\nPublished in November 2013, Kenneth Womack's *Made to Order: The Sheetz Story* traces the company's history from its dairy-store origins through the present day.\n\n\nIn 2014, Sheetz opened its second distribution center and kitchen facility in Burlington, North Carolina.[14]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSales for fiscal year 2018\u20132019 totaled $7.5 billion.[15] Sheetz now has more than 600 locations across Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, Ohio and North Carolina, and more than 21,000 employees with plans to expand even further.

Upon Sheetz's official arrival in the area with the opening of the first of two stores in Delaware in April 2021, Travis Sheetz said that the company had considered expanding into Columbus as early as the late 1990s when the company first expanded into Northeast Ohio, but decided to expand into North Carolina instead and only recently started expanding into Central Ohio due to many social media requests from transplants now living in the area asking for Sheetz.[25]\n\n\nIn 2019, Sheetz opened an IT tech center in Pittsburgh's Bakery Square complex, serving as a secondary headquarters for the company. They later expanded the space in 2023.[26]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Map of Sheetz locations as of February 2021 (non-fuel locations in blue); this was prior to Sheetz's official expansion into the Columbus, Ohio market two months later.\nOn December 19, 2019, Sheetz celebrated the opening of its 600th store in Shaler Township, PA.[27]\n\n\nFollowing the chain's successful expansion into the Columbus market, in April 2022 Sheetz announced an expansion into the Dayton, Ohio, market beginning in 2024. The move will put Sheetz up head-to-head with Casey's for the first time, while also competing with Speedway, Circle K, and UDF in the market.[28][29] The move will also leave Cincinnati and (initially) Toledo as the only major Ohio markets without Sheetz.\n\n\nOn November 29, 2022, Sheetz announced it would expand into Michigan for the first time, beginning with Detroit in 2025;[6] Sheetz then announced an expansion to nearby Toledo shortly thereafter. On December 23, 2022, Sheetz announced an expansion into Wilmington, North Carolina to keep expanding south.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** [1] KDKA.

In 1969, Steve became general manager. The brothers planned to expand at the rate of one store per year with a target of seven stores by 1972. In 1972, the company expanded from seven to fourteen stores. One year later, Sheetz began selling gasoline, and opened the first self-serve gas pumps in central Pennsylvania. The first Sheetz store outside Pennsylvania opened in Maryland in 1976.\n\n\nIn 1981, Bob retired and Steve became president. By 1983, Bob and Steve had opened 100 stores.

The Reed Gold Mine operated until 1912.[58] The Charlotte Mint was active until 1861, when Confederate forces seized it at the outbreak of the Civil War. The mint was not reopened at the war's end, but the building, albeit in a different location, now houses the Mint Museum of Art.\n\n\nThe city's first boom came after the Civil War, as Charlotte became a cotton processing center and railroad hub. By the 1880s, Charlotte sat astride the Southern Railway mainline from Atlanta to Washington, D.C. Farmers from miles around would bring cotton to the railroad platform in Uptown. Local promotors began building textile factories, starting with the 1881 Charlotte Cotton Mill that still stands at Graham and 5th streets.[59]\n\n\nCharlotte's city population at the 1890 census grew to 11,557.[60]\n\n\n\n### Early 20th century to present[edit]\n\n\nIn 1910, Charlotte surpassed Wilmington to become North Carolina's largest city with 34,014 residents.[61]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 312.00 square miles (808.1\u00a0km2), of which 310.02 square miles (802.9\u00a0km2) is land and 1.98 square miles (5.1\u00a0km2) (0.63%) is water.[7] Charlotte is the twenty-sixth-most expansive city in the United States and lies at an elevation of 751 feet (229\u00a0m).\nCharlotte constitutes most of Mecklenburg County in the Carolina Piedmont.[71] Uptown Charlotte sits atop a long rise between two creeks, Sugar Creek and Irwin Creek, and was built on the gunnies of the St. Catherine's and Rudisill gold mines.[72] Charlotte is 25 miles (40\u00a0km) southwest of Concord,[73] 26 miles (42\u00a0km) northeast of Rock Hill, South Carolina,[74] 83 miles (134\u00a0km) southwest of Greensboro,[75] 135 miles (217\u00a0km) west of Fayetteville,[76] and 165 miles (266\u00a0km) southwest of Raleigh, the state capitol.[77]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nLargest city in North Carolina\n\n\"Charlotte\" redirects here.

The camp supported 40,000 soldiers, with many troops and suppliers staying after the war, launching urbanization that eventually overtook older cities along the Piedmont Crescent. In the 1920 census, Charlotte fell to being the state's second largest city, Winston-Salem with 48,395 people, had two thousand more people than Charlotte. Charlotte would pass Winston-Salem in population by the 1930 census, and has remained North Carolina's largest city since.[62]\n\n\nUntil 1958, the Seaboard Air Line Railroad operated a daily passenger train from its own station (which had opened in 1896) to Wilmington.[63][64]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n19. **^** Blackmon, Chyna (April 14, 2023). \"Home purchases among millennials have surged in Charlotte, This chart tracks growth\". *The Charlotte Observer*.

As of 2015[update], around 4.1% of Orlando's population identify as LGBT+,[53] making Orlando the city with the 20th-highest percentage of LGBT residents in the country.[54] The city is host to Gay Days every June (a Pride Month event at Walt Disney World),[55] holds a huge Pride festival and parade every October (since 2005), and is home to Florida's first openly gay City Commissioner, Patty Sheehan.[56]\n\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFrom the mid-20th century to the early 21st century, Orlando was one of the most politically conservative cities in the United States, having voted for the Republican candidate in every presidential election from 1948 to 2004. This streak was broken when Barack Obama won it in 2008, becoming the first Democrat to carry the city in a presidential election since Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1944. It has since become a Democratic stronghold in statewide and local elections.\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\nPublic primary and secondary education is handled by Orange County Public Schools. Some of the private schools include Saint James Cathedral School (founded 1928), Orlando Lutheran Academy, Forest Lake Academy, The First Academy, Ibn Seena Academy, Trinity Preparatory School, Lake Highland Preparatory School, Bishop Moore High School and Orlando Christian Prep.\n\n\n\n### Area institutions of higher education[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHistorically, the unemployment rate in Greater Orlando was low, which resulted in growth that led to urban sprawl in the surrounding area and, in combination with the United States housing bubble, to a large increase in home prices. Metro Orlando's unemployment rate in June 2010 was 11.1 percent, was 11.4 percent in April 2010, and was about 10 percent in about the same time of year in 2009.[62] As of August 2013, the area's jobless rate was 6.6 percent.[63] Housing prices in Greater Orlando went up 37.08% in one year, from a median of $182,300 in November 2004 to $249,900 in November 2005, and eventually peaked at $264,436 in July 2007. From there, with the economic meltdown, prices plummeted, with the median falling below $200,000 in September 2008, at one point falling at an annual rate of 39.27%. The median dipped below $100,000 in 2010 before stabilizing around $110,000 in 2011. As of April 2012, the median home price is $116,000.[64]\n\n\n\n### Tourism[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOrlando is a major population center and has a considerable hurricane risk, although it is not as high as in South Florida's urban corridor or other coastal regions. Since the city is located 42 miles (68\u00a0km) inland from the Atlantic and 77 miles (124\u00a0km) inland from the Gulf of Mexico,[a] hurricanes usually weaken before arriving. Storm surges are not a concern since the region is 100 feet (30\u00a0m) above mean sea level. Despite its location, the city does see strong hurricanes. During the notorious 2004 hurricane season, Orlando was hit by three hurricanes that caused significant damage, with Hurricane Charley the worst of these. The city also experienced widespread damage during Hurricane Donna in 1960.[35]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

The deed is dated February 11, 1755, when John Carteret, 2nd Earl Granville conveyed 635 acres (257\u00a0ha) for the \"Salisbury Township\".[7] The settlement was built at the intersection of longtime Native American trading routes. It became an economic hub along what was improved as the Great Wagon Road in North Carolina.[9] It became the principal city of the Salisbury judicial and militia districts in the years leading up to the American Revolutionary War.[7] On June 12, 1792, Salisbury was granted a US Post Office. Its first postmaster was George Lauman. This post office has been in continuous operation ever since.[10][11]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMajor employers in Salisbury include the headquarters of Food Lion, a regional grocery chain that is one of the US subsidiaries of Delhaize;[23] the W.G.

According to a 2019 estimate from the United States Census Bureau, the city population was 239,798, making it the thirteenth-most populous city in Texas, and 93rd most populous city in the U.S.[11] Irving is noted for its racial and ethnic diversity, and has been ranked as one of the most diverse cities in the United States.[12][13] Irving includes the Las Colinas mixed-use master-planned community and part of the Dallas Fort Worth International Airport.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIrving has been noted for its racial and ethnic diversity.[12] A 2012 study by the real estate website Trulia found that Irving's 75038 zip code was the most diverse zip code in the United States,[12] while Irving was ranked as the ninth-most diverse city in the United States with over 200,000 residents according to a Diversity Index developed by Brown University's American Communities Project. The same survey said Irving was the eighth-most diverse city at a neighborhood level (again among cities with over 200,000 residents); Irving was the highest-ranked city in Texas at the city level and behind only Garland, TX at the neighborhood level.[13]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBy the early 1960s the city had a population of approximately 45,000.

They play at Peoples Natural Gas Field in Altoona.[12] The Altoona Symphony Orchestra has called Altoona home since 1928.[13] Prominent landmarks include the Horseshoe Curve, the Railroaders Memorial Museum, the Juniata Shops of the Altoona Works, the Mishler Theatre, the Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament, and the Jaffa Shrine Center.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Pennsylvania in the American Revolution and Pennsylvania in the American Civil War\n\n### Etymology[edit]\n\n\nOne explanation of the city's name is that the word Altoona is a derivative of the Latin word *altus*, meaning high.[14]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\"Station: Altoon Blair CO AP, PA\". *U.S. Climate Normals 2020: U.S. Monthly Climate Normals (1991-2020)*.

Some significant neighborhoods are Little Italy, Gospel Hill, Toy Town, Columbia Park, Knickerbockers, and Curtin. Some areas within Logan Township, outside the city limits but still considered sections of Altoona, are Lakemont, Greenwood, Bellmeade, Westfall, Newburg, and Red Hill. Many of the older districts consist of a mix of rowhouses and individual homes, which were a common building style in railroad towns so-as to provide for worker and manager housing, respectively.\n\n\n\n#### Downtown[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)*Altoona in 1895: a Pennsylvania Railroad town*, a lithograph by Thaddeus Mortimer Fowler\nPrior to European settlement, the Altoona area was inhabited by the Iroquois Confederacy.[18] Altoona was founded by the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) in 1849 as the site for a shop and maintenance complex. Altoona was incorporated as a borough on February 6, 1854, and as a city under legislation approved on April 3, 1867, and February 8, 1868.[19]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Articles relating to Altoona, Pennsylvania\n |\n| --- |\n| | * v\n* t\n* e\nCity of Altoona\n |\n| --- |\n| Attractions | * Horseshoe Curve\n* Lakemont Park\n\t+ Leap-The-Dips\n* Mishler Theatre\n* Logan Valley Mall\n* Penn Alto Building\n* Railroaders Memorial Museum\n* Allegheny Portage Railroad\n |\n| Transportation | * Altoona Transportation Center\n* Altoona\u2013Blair County Airport\n* AMTRAN\n |\n| Religion | * Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament\n* Roman Catholic Diocese\n |\n| Education | * Penn State Altoona\n* Bishop Guilfoyle High School\n* Altoona Area School District\n* Altoona Area High School\n |\n| Industry | * UPMC Altoona\n* Altoona Works\n* Boyer Candies\n* Sheetz\n |\n| Sports | * Altoona Curve\n* Peoples Natural Gas Field\n |\n| Newspapers | * Altoona Mirror\n |\n| Television | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn late September 1862, Altoona was home to the War Governors' Conference which brought together 13 governors of Union states. This body gave early approval to the Emancipation Proclamation. The town grew rapidly in the late 19th century, its population approximately 2,000 in 1854, 10,000 in 1870, and 20,000 in 1880. The demand for locomotives during the Civil War stimulated much of this growth, and by the later years of the war, Altoona was known as a valuable city for the North. Altoona was also the site of the first Interstate Commission meeting to create and design the Gettysburg National Cemetery following the devastating Battle of Gettysburg. The centrality and convenience of the town's rail transportation brought these two important gatherings to the city during the war.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Horseshoe Curve[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Horseshoe Curve (Pennsylvania)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)The Fairview neighborhood in Altoona\nAltoona lies at the base of Brush Mountain within Logan Valley and Pleasant Valley.
