Brown's current campus on College Hill is established with the construction of University Hall (1770). The college closes in December 1776 due to the American Revolution and reopens in September 1782.[1] |\n| 2\n | ![](image) | Jonathan Maxcy | 1787 | 1768\u20131820 | 1792\u20131802 | First *alum* to be president and youngest president in Brown's history; Maxcy's reputation as a skilled orator benefited the reputation of the fledgling college.[2][3] Enrollment passed 100 students (1800).\n |\n| 3\n | ![](image) | Asa Messer | 1790 | 1769\u20131836 | 1802\u20131826 | The *College of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations* was renamed *Brown University* following a gift from Nicholas Brown, Jr (1804). A program in medical study was organized (1811) following the examples set by Harvard and Dartmouth. The Messer administration was characterized by increasing unruliness and misbehavior of students.[4] |\n| 4\n | ![](image) | Francis Wayland | \u2013 | 1796\u20131865 | 1827\u20131855 | Wayland sought out to improve student discipline. Medical instruction was suspended (1827) following a dispute over a proposed residence requirement for medical professors.[5] Brown established the third civilian engineering program in the country (1847). Wayland urged adoption of a broader curriculum (1850), laying the groundwork for the Open Curriculum.\n |\n| 5\n | ![](image) | Barnas Sears | 1825 | 1802\u20131880 | 1855\u20131867 | Despite the Panic of 1857 and Civil War, Sears oversaw the construction of a new chemistry laboratory and an increase in the University's endowment.[6] Entrance and degree requirements were made stricter, benefiting the reputation of the University.[7] Sears was widely popular among students.[8] |\n| 6\n | ![](image) | Alexis Caswell | 1822 | 1799\u20131877 | 1868\u20131872 | The University's financial assets grew by nearly 85%.Tuition, faculty salaries, and enrollment all increased.[9] |\n| 7\n | ![](image) | Ezekiel Robinson[10] | 1838 | 1815\u20131894 | 1872\u20131889 | Graduate study was instituted (1888\u20131889).

The Women's College was renamed *Pembroke College in Brown University* (1928).\n |\n| 10\n | ![](image) | Clarence Barbour | 1888 | 1867\u20131937 | 1929\u20131937 | Last of long line of Baptist minister Presidents\n |\n| 11\n | ![](image) | Henry Wriston | \u2013 | 1889\u20131978 | 1937\u20131955 | First non-Baptist (Methodist) president and first president since Wayland to not be a Brown alumnus\n |\n| 12\n |  | Barnaby Keeney | \u2013 | 1914\u20131980 | 1955\u20131966 | Brown purchased the Dexter Asylum property.\n |\n| 13\n |  | Ray Heffner | \u2013 | 1925\u20132012 | 1966\u20131969 | Brown's New Curriculum was passed. Heffner resigned after only three years, stating \"I have simply reached the conclusion that I do not enjoy being a university president.\"[12] |\n| 14\n |  | Donald Hornig | \u2013 | 1920\u20132013 | 1970\u20131976 | Pembroke fully merged with the College of Brown University (1971). A medical program was re-established (1972).[13] |\n| 15\n |  | Howard Swearer | \u2013 | 1932\u20131991 | 1977\u20131988 | Under Swearer's leadership, Brown advanced in rankings, saw a threefold increase in research grants, quadrupled its previously-dwindling endowment, and grew in popularity.[14][15] The Watson Institute was founded as the Institute for International Studies (1986). Brown's athletic facilities expanded significantly with the construction of both the Olney-Margolies Athletic Center (1981) and the Pizzitola Sports Center (1988).[16] |\n| 16\n | ![](image) | Vartan Gregorian | \u2013 | 1934\u20132021 | 1989\u20131997 | Vartan Gregorian was Brown's first foreign-born president. During his tenure, Brown saw fundraising success, with the University's endowment surpassing $1 billion.[17] Applications increased, undergraduate scholarships doubled, and the University's reputation grew.[18][19] |\n| 17\n | ![](image) | Gordon Gee | \u2013 | 1944\u2013 | 1998\u20132000 | Plans were announced for a large biomedical sciences building requiring the sale of $80 million in bonds; funds were cut for a popular string quartet drawing criticism that Gee's vision is at odds with the University's liberal arts-oriented identity.[20] Gee resigned abruptly after only two years in a move criticized by University leaders.[21] |\n| 18\n | ![](image) | Ruth Simmons | \u2013 | 1945\u2013 | 2001\u20132012 | At the time of her appointment Simmons became Brown's first woman president and the first African-American president of an Ivy League university.[22] In 2001, *Time* named Simmons America's best college president. The Sidney E. Frank Hall for Life Sciences (2006) and Granoff Center for the Creative Arts both opened (2011).\nFollowing a $100 million gift, the Medical School was renamed the *Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University* (2007).[23] The University opened a new medical campus in the Jewelry District (2011).[24]\n |\n| 19\n | ![](image) | Christina Paxson | \u2013 | 1960\u2013 | 2012\u2013 | Christina Paxson is Brown's current president. During her tenure, Brown has established its School of Public Health, expanded the physical footprint of the School of Engineering, and completed a historically large fundraising campaign.[25][26] The university has also undertaken a significant expansion of residential facilities, constructing its first new dormitories in 35 years.[27][28] |\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Encyclopedia Brunoniana | Revolutionary War\". *www.brown.edu*.

Its official corporate name is \"The Trustees of Columbia University in the City of New York\". The university's first charter was granted in 1754 by King George II; however, its modern charter was first enacted in 1787 and last amended in 1810 by the New York State Legislature. The university is governed by 24 trustees, customarily including the president, who serves *ex officio*. The trustees themselves are responsible for choosing their successors. Six of the 24 are nominated from a pool of candidates recommended by the Columbia Alumni Association. Another six are nominated by the board in consultation with the executive committee of the University Senate. The remaining 12, including the president, are nominated by the trustees themselves through their internal processes. The term of office for trustees is six years. Generally, they serve for no more than two consecutive terms. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The Barnard College Class of 1913 processes down the steps of Low Library.\nColumbia has four official undergraduate colleges: Columbia College, the liberal arts college offering the Bachelor of Arts degree; the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science (also known as SEAS or Columbia Engineering), the engineering and applied science school offering the Bachelor of Science degree; the School of General Studies, the liberal arts college offering the Bachelor of Arts degree to non-traditional students undertaking full- or part-time study; and Barnard College.[139][140] Barnard College is a women's liberal arts college and an academic affiliate in which students receive a Bachelor of Arts degree from Columbia University. Their degrees are signed by the presidents of Columbia University and Barnard College.[141][142] Barnard students are also eligible to cross-register classes that are available through the Barnard Catalogue and alumnae can join the Columbia Alumni Association.[143]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Undergraduate admissions statistics |\n| --- |\n| 2021 enteringclass[123]Change vs.2016[124]\n\n\n---\n\n |\n| Admit rate | 3.9% (![Neutral decrease](image)\u00a0\u22122.1)\n |\n| Yield rate | 66.5% (![Increase](image)\u00a0+1.4)\n |\n| Test scores middle 50% |\n| SAT Total | 1510\u20131560 (![Decrease](image)\u00a0\u221210 median)\n |\n|  |\n\n\nColumbia University received 60,551 applications for the class of 2025 (entering 2021) and a total of around 2,218 were admitted to the two schools for an overall acceptance rate of 3.66%.[125] Columbia is a racially diverse school, with approximately 52% of all students identifying themselves as persons of color. Additionally, 50% of all undergraduates received grants from Columbia. The average grant size awarded to these students is $46,516.[126] In 2015\u20132016, annual undergraduate tuition at Columbia was $50,526 with a total cost of attendance of $65,860 (including room and board).[127] The college is need-blind for domestic applicants.[128]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2021, Columbia was ranked seventh in the world (sixth in the United States) by *Academic Ranking of World Universities*, sixth in the world by *U.S. News & World Report*, 19th in the world by *QS World University Rankings*, and 11th globally by *Times Higher Education World University Rankings*. It was ranked in the first tier of American research universities, along with Harvard, MIT, and Stanford, in the 2019 report from the Center for Measuring University Performance. Columbia's Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation was ranked the second most admired graduate program by Architectural Record in 2020.\n\n\nIn 2011, the Mines ParisTech: Professional Ranking of World Universities ranked Columbia third best university for forming CEOs in the US and 12th worldwide.\n\n\n\n#### Controversies[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nJoint degree programs are available through Union Theological Seminary, the Jewish Theological Seminary of America,[144] and the Juilliard School.[145][146] Teachers College and Barnard College are official faculties of the university; both colleges' presidents are deans under the university governance structure.[147] The Columbia University Senate includes faculty and student representatives from Teachers College and Barnard College who serve two-year terms; all senators are accorded full voting privileges regarding matters impacting the entire university. Teachers College is an affiliated, financially independent graduate school with their own board of trustees.[137][138] Pursuant to an affiliation agreement, Columbia is given the authority to confer \"degrees and diplomas\" to the graduates of Teachers College. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nColumbia University is home to many fraternities, sororities, and co-educational Greek organizations. Approximately 10\u201315% of undergraduate students are associated with Greek life.[201] Many Barnard women also join Columbia sororities. There has been a Greek presence on campus since the establishment in 1836 of the Delta chapter of Alpha Delta Phi.[202] The InterGreek Council is the self-governing student organization that provides guidelines and support to its member organizations within each of the three councils at Columbia, the Interfraternity Council, Panhellenic Council, and Multicultural Greek Council. The three council presidents bring their affiliated chapters together once a month to meet as one Greek community. The InterGreek Council meetings provide opportunity for member organizations to learn from each other, work together and advocate for community needs.[203]\n\n\n\n#### Publications[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Columbia Undergraduate Schools[134] |\n| --- |\n| **College/school** | **Year founded** |\n| Columbia College | 1754\n |\n| Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science | 1864\n |\n| Barnard College (affiliate) | 1889\n |\n| Columbia University School of General Studies | 1947\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n193. **^** \"Edwin Howard Armstrong Memorial Award.

For much of the 19th century, the university consisted of decentralized and separate faculties specializing in Political Science, Philosophy, and Pure Science. In 1979, these faculties were merged into the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.[92] In 1991, the faculties of Columbia College, the School of General Studies, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, the School of the Arts, and the School of Professional Studies were merged into the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, leading to the academic integration and centralized governance of these schools. In 2010, the School of International and Public Affairs, which was previously a part of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, became an independent faculty.[93]\n\n\n\n## Campus[edit]\n\n\n### Morningside Heights[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Established in 1769 by Eleazar Wheelock, it is one of the nine colonial colleges chartered before the American Revolution. Although originally established to educate Native Americans in Christian theology and the English way of life, the university primarily trained Congregationalist ministers during its early history before it gradually secularized. Emerging into national prominence at the turn of the 20th century, Dartmouth was considered to be the most prestigious undergraduate college in the United States in the early 1900s.[8][9] While Dartmouth is now a research university rather than simply an undergraduate college, it continues to go by \"Dartmouth College\" to emphasize its focus on undergraduate education.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n38. **^** \"When did Dartmouth become co-educational?\". *AskDartmouth*.

During World War II, students at Radcliffe College (which, since its 1879 founding, had been paying Harvard professors to repeat their lectures for women) began attending Harvard classes alongside men.[32] In 1945, women were first admitted to the medical school.[33]\nSince 1971, Harvard had controlled essentially all aspects of undergraduate admission, instruction, and housing for Radcliffe women; in 1999, Radcliffe was formally merged into Harvard.[34]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn December 15, 2022, Claudine Gay, a Harvard University political scientist and former dean of Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences, succeeded Bacow as the university's 30th president.\n\n\n\n## Campuses[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Memorial Hall\n### Cambridge[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Harvard Divinity School, Harvard Graduate School of Design, Harvard Graduate School of Education, Harvard John A.

The Yard contains administrative offices such as University Hall and Massachusetts Hall; libraries such as Widener, Pusey, Houghton, and Lamont; and Memorial Church.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the 20th century, Harvard's reputation grew as its endowment burgeoned and prominent intellectuals and professors affiliated with the university. The university's rapid enrollment growth also was a product of both the founding of new graduate academic programs and an expansion of the undergraduate college. Radcliffe College emerged as the female counterpart of Harvard College, becoming one of the most prominent schools for women in the United States. In 1900, Harvard became a founding member of the Association of American Universities.[12]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n116. **^** \"College Scorecard: Harvard University\".

It is one of nine colonial colleges and was chartered prior to the U.S. Declaration of Independence when Benjamin Franklin, the university's founder and first president, advocated for an educational institution that trained leaders in academia, commerce, and public service. Penn identifies as the fourth oldest institution of higher education in the United States, though this representation is challenged by other universities, as Franklin first convened the Board of Trustees in 1749, arguably making it the fifth oldest institution of higher education in the U.S.[note 2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWoodland Walk pathway between Hill College House and Lauder College House\n* ![](image)\n\nHill College House, a dormitory designed in 1958 to house female students, was designed by Eero Saarinen\n* ![](image)\n\n\"The Quad\", formerly known as the Men's Dormitory, in 2014\n* ![](image)\n\nThe Alpha Tau Omega fraternity house, built by George W.

All officers are sworn municipal police officers and retain general law enforcement authority while on the campus.[157]\n\n\n\n## Academics and interdisciplinary focus[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPenn has a strong focus on interdisciplinary learning and research. It offers double degree programs, unique majors, and academic flexibility. Penn's \"One University\" policy allows undergraduates access to courses at all of Penn's undergraduate and graduate schools except the medical, veterinary and dental schools. Undergraduates at Penn may also take courses at Bryn Mawr, Haverford, and Swarthmore under a reciprocal agreement known as the Quaker Consortium.\n\n\n\n### Admissions[edit]\n\n\nUndergraduate admissions to the University of Pennsylvania is considered by *US News* to be \"most selective\". Admissions officials consider a student's GPA to be a very important academic factor, with emphasis on an applicant's high school class rank and letters of recommendation.[167] Admission is need-blind for U.S., Canadian, and Mexican applicants.[168]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPenn alumni who are founders of technology companies include Ralph J. Roberts (co-founder of Comcast); Elon Musk (co-founder of PayPal, Tesla, OpenAI and Neuralink, founder of SpaceX and The Boring Company); Leonard Bosack (co-founder of Cisco); David J. Brown (co-founder of Silicon Graphics) and Mark Pincus (founder of Zynga, the company behind FarmVille).\n\n\nAmong other distinguished alumni are the current or past presidents of over one hundred universities including Harvard University (Drew Gilpin Faust, Harvard's first female president), Cornell University (Martha E. Pollack), Penn (Judith Rodin, first female president in the Ivy League), Princeton University (Harold Dodds), the University of California (Mark Yudof), Carnegie Mellon University (Jared Cohon), and Northwestern University (Morton O.

A large number of students migrating to universities under the G.I.

But in addition to a significant student population from the Delaware Valley, the university continued to attract international students from at least 50 countries and from all 50 states as early as of the second decade of the 1920s.[84][87] Penn Trustee Paul Miller wrote that, in the post-World War II era,: \"[t]he bricks-and-mortar Capital Campaign of the Sixties...built the facilities that turned Penn from a commuter school to a residential one....\"[88] By 1961, 79% of male undergraduates and 57% of female undergraduates lived on campus.[89]\n\n\n\n### Controversies[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n166. **^** Meyerson, Martin (January 29, 1973). \"Report of the University Development Commission\" (PDF). *upenn.com*.

Since it lacked an affiliated women's college, it was often referred to as a \"monastery\", both lovingly and derisively, by members of the Princeton community.[136][137]\nFor about a decade, from 1887 to 1897, nearby Evelyn College for Women was largely comprised of daughters of professors and sisters of Princeton undergraduates. While no legal connection existed, many Princeton professors taught there and several Princeton administrations, like Francis Patton, were on its board of trustees. It closed in 1897 following the death of its founder, Joshua McIlvaine.[138]\n\n\n\n![](image)Pyne Hall, where the first female students lived on campus.\nIn 1947, three female members of the library staff enrolled in beginner Russian courses to deal with an increase in Russian literature in the library.[110]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 1963, five women came to Princeton for one year to study \"critical languages\" as undergraduates, but were not candidates for a Princeton degree.[110] Following abortive discussions with Sarah Lawrence College to relocate the women's college to Princeton and merge it with the university in 1967,[143] the administration commissioned a report on admitting women. The final report was issued in January 1969, supporting the idea.[110] That same month, Princeton's trustees voted 24\u20138 in favor of coeducation and began preparing the institution for the transition.[144] The university finished these plans in April 1969 and announced there would be coeducation in September.[145] Ultimately, 101 female freshman and 70 female transfer students enrolled at Princeton in September 1969.[146][145][c] Those admitted were housed in Pyne Hall, a fairly isolated dormitory; a security system was added, although the women deliberately broke it within a day.[148]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPrinceton's 20th and current president Christopher Eisgruber was elected in 2013.[130] In 2017, Princeton University unveiled a large-scale public history and digital humanities investigation into its historical involvement with slavery called the Princeton & Slavery Project. The project saw the publication of hundreds of primary sources, 80 scholarly essays, a scholarly conference, a series of short plays, and an art project.[131] In April 2018, university trustees announced that they would name two public spaces for James Collins Johnson and Betsey Stockton, enslaved people who lived and worked on Princeton's campus and whose stories were publicized by the project.[132] In 2019, large-scale student activism again entered the mainstream concerning the school's implementation of federal Title IX policy relating to Campus sexual assault.[133][134] The activism consisted of sit-ins in response to a student's disciplinary sentence.[135]\n\n\n\n### Coeducation[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 1961, Princeton admitted its first female graduate student, Sabra Follett Meservey,[136] who would go on to be the first woman to earn a master's degree at Princeton.[110] Meservey was, at the time of her admission, already a member of the faculty at Douglass College within Princeton. The dean of the graduate school issued a statement clarifying that Meservey's admission was an exception, and that \"Princeton may permit other women in the future as special cases, but does not plan to make general admissions of women graduate students.\"[139] The student-run *Daily Princetonian* ran four articles about Meservey in one issue,[139][140][141][142] including an editorial lamenting the potential \"far reaching implications\" of Meservey's admission which concluded: \"Princeton is unique as an undergraduate men's college and must remain so.\"[142] Eight more women enrolled the following year in the Graduate School.[136] In 1964, T'sai-ying Cheng became the first woman at Princeton to receive a Ph.D. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n140. **^** \"Princeton Takes First Woman Student As Local Resident Enters Grad School: Ms. Meservey Begins Study Toward Degree\". *The Daily Princetonian*. **LXXXV** (51): 1, 4.

Founded in 1746 in Elizabeth as the  **College of New Jersey**, Princeton is the fourth-oldest institution of higher education in the United States and one of the nine colonial colleges chartered before the American Revolution.[8][9][a] The institution moved to Newark in 1747, and then to the current site nine years later. It officially became a university in 1896 and was subsequently renamed Princeton University.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![An image that shows Christopher Eisgruber signing a paper](image)Christopher Eisgruber, the 20th and current president of the university\nPrinceton's 20th and current president is Christopher Eisgruber, who was appointed by the university's board of trustees in 2013.[130] The board is responsible for the overall direction of the university. It consists of no fewer than 23 and no more than 40 members at any one time, with the president of the university and the Governor of New Jersey serving as ex officio members. It approves the operating and capital budgets, supervises the investment of the university's endowment, and oversees campus real estate and long-range physical planning. The trustees also exercise prior review and approval concerning changes in major policies such as those in instructional programs and admission as well as tuition and fees and the hiring of faculty members.[216]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPrinceton has made significant progress in expanding the diversity of its student body in recent years. The 2021 admitted freshman class was one of the most diverse in the school's history, with 68% of students identifying as students of color.[375] The university has worked to increase its enrollment of first-generation and low-income students in recent years.[376] The median family income of Princeton students is $186,100, with 72% of students coming from the top 20% highest-earning families.[377] In 2017, 22% of freshman qualified for federal Pell Grants, above the 16% average for the top 150 schools ranked by the *U.S. News & World Report*; nationwide, the average was 44%.[378] Based on data in a 2019 article in *The Daily Princetonian,* 10% of students hail from *Bloomberg's* 2018 list of \"100 richest places\", and that the top 20% of high schools send as many students to Princeton as the bottom 80%.[379]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n373. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Public Transit\". *Transportation & Parking Services*.
