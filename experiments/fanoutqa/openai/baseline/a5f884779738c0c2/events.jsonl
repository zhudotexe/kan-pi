Ares, the god of war, was known to the Romans as Mars.\n\n\nCompared to the Earth's Moon, the moons Phobos and Deimos are small. Phobos has a diameter of 22.2 km (13.8 mi) and a mass of 1.08×1016 kg, while Deimos measures 12.6 km (7.8 mi) across, with a mass of 2.0×1015 kg. Phobos orbits closer to Mars, with a semi-major axis of 9,377 km (5,827 mi) and an orbital period of 7.66 hours; while Deimos orbits farther with a semi-major axis of 23,460 km (14,580 mi) and an orbital period of 30.35 hours.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Early speculation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*Curiosity's* view of the Martian moons: Phobos passing in front of Deimos – in *real-time* (video-gif, 1 August 2013)\nSpeculation about the existence of the moons of Mars had begun when the moons of Jupiter were discovered. When Galileo Galilei, as a hidden report about his having observed two bumps on the sides of Saturn (later discovered to be its rings), used the anagram *smaismrmilmepoetaleumibunenugttauiras* for *Altissimum planetam tergeminum observavi* (\"I have observed the most distant planet to have a triple form\"), Johannes Kepler had misinterpreted it to mean *Salve umbistineum geminatum Martia proles* (Hello, furious twins, sons of Mars).[4]\n\n\n\nPerhaps inspired by Kepler (and quoting Kepler's third law of planetary motion), Jonathan Swift's satire *Gulliver's Travels* (1726) refers to two moons in Part 3, Chapter 3 (the \"Voyage to Laputa\"), in which Laputa's astronomers are described as having discovered two satellites of Mars orbiting at distances of 3 and 5 Martian diameters with periods of 10 and 21.5 hours. Phobos and Deimos (both found in 1877, more than a century after Swift's novel) have actual orbital distances of 1.4 and 3.5 Martian diameters, and their respective orbital periods are 7.66 and 30.35 hours.[5][6] In the 20th century, V. G. Perminov, a spacecraft designer of early Soviet Mars and Venus spacecraft, speculated Swift found and deciphered records that Martians left on Earth.[7] However, the view of most astronomers is that Swift was simply employing a common argument of the time, that as the inner planets Venus and Mercury had no satellites, Earth had one and Jupiter had four (known at the time), that Mars by analogy must have two. Furthermore, as they had not yet been discovered, it was reasoned that they must be small and close to Mars. This would lead Swift to make a roughly accurate estimate of their orbital distances and revolution periods. In addition, Swift could have been helped in his calculations by his friend, the mathematician John Arbuthnot.[8]\n\n\nVoltaire's 1752 short story \"Micromégas\", about an alien visitor to Earth, also refers to two moons of Mars. Voltaire was presumably influenced by Swift.[9][10] In recognition of these 'predictions', two craters on Deimos are named Swift and Voltaire,[11][12] while on Phobos there is one named regio, *Laputa Regio*, and one named planitia, *Lagado Planitia*, both of which are named after places in *Gulliver's Travels* (the fictional Laputa, a flying island, and Lagado, imaginary capital of the fictional nation Balnibarbi).[13] Many of the craters on Phobos are also named after characters in *Gulliver's Travels*.[14]\n\n\n\n### Discovery[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The telescope used by Asaph Hall in the discovery of the Martian moons\nAsaph Hall discovered Deimos on 12 August 1877 at about 07:48 UTC and Phobos on 18 August 1877, at the US Naval Observatory (the Old Naval Observatory in Foggy Bottom) in Washington, D.C., at about 09:14 GMT (contemporary sources, using the pre-1925 astronomical convention that began the day at noon,[15] give the time of discovery as 11 August 14:40 and 17 August 16:06 Washington mean time respectively).[16][17][18] At the time, he was deliberately searching for Martian moons. Hall had previously seen what appeared to be a Martian moon on 10 August, but due to bad weather, he could not definitively identify them until later.\n\n\nHall recorded his discovery of Phobos in his notebook as follows:[19]\n\n\n\n\n> \n> \"I repeated the examination in the early part of the night of 11th [August 1877], and again found nothing, but trying again some hours later I found a faint object on the following side and a little north of the planet. I had barely time to secure an observation of its position when fog from the River stopped the work. This was at half-past two o'clock on the night of the 11th. Cloudy weather intervened for several days.\n> \"On 15 August the weather looking more promising, I slept at the Observatory. The sky cleared off with a thunderstorm at 11 o'clock and the search was resumed. The atmosphere however was in a very bad condition and Mars was so blazing and unsteady that nothing could be seen of the object, which we now know was at that time so near the planet as to be invisible.\n> \"On 16 August the object was found again on the following side of the planet, and the observations of that night showed that it was moving with the planet and if a satellite, was near one of its elongations. Until this time I had said nothing to anyone at the Observatory of my search for a satellite of Mars, but on leaving the observatory after these observations of the 16th, at about three o'clock in the morning, I told my assistant, George Anderson, to whom I had shown the object, that I thought I had discovered a satellite of Mars. I told him also to keep quiet as I did not wish anything said until the matter was beyond doubt. He said nothing, but the thing was too good to keep and I let it out myself. On 17 August between one and two o'clock, while I was reducing my observations, Professor Newcomb came into my room to eat his lunch and I showed him my measures of the faint object near Mars which proved that it was moving with the planet.\n> \"On 17 August while waiting and watching for the outer moon, the inner one was discovered. The observations of the 17th and 18th put beyond doubt the character of these objects and the discovery was publicly announced by Admiral Rodgers.\"\n> \n\n\nThe telescope used for the discovery was the 26-inch (66 cm) refractor (telescope with a lens) then located at Foggy Bottom.[20] In 1893 the lens was remounted and put in a new dome, where it remains into the 21st century.[21]\n\n\nThe names, originally spelled *Phobus* and *Deimus*, respectively, were suggested by Henry Madan (1838–1901), Science Master of Eton, from Book XV of the *Iliad*, where Ares summons Fear and Fright.[22] The granddaughter of Henry Madan's brother Falconer Madan was Venetia Burney, who first suggested the name of Pluto.\n\n\n\n### Mars moon hoax[edit]\n\n\nIn 1959, Walter Scott Houston perpetrated a celebrated April Fool's hoax in the April edition of the *Great Plains Observer*, claiming that \"Dr. Arthur Hayall of the University of the Sierras reports that the moons of Mars are actually artificial satellites\". Both Dr. Hayall and the University of the Sierras were fictitious. The hoax gained worldwide attention when Houston's claim was repeated in earnest by a Soviet scientist, Iosif Shklovsky,[23] who, based on a later-disproven density estimate, suggested Phobos was a hollow metal shell.\n\n\n\n### Recent surveys[edit]\n\n\nSearches have been conducted for additional satellites. In 2003, Scott S. Sheppard and David C. Jewitt surveyed nearly the entire Hill sphere of Mars for irregular satellites. However scattered light from Mars prevented them from searching the inner few arcminutes where the satellites Phobos and Deimos reside. No new satellites were found to an apparent limiting red magnitude of 23.5, which corresponds to radii of about 0.09 km using an albedo of 0.07.[24]\n\n\n\n## Characteristics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Apparent sizes of the moons of Mars, Deimos and Phobos, and the Moon as viewed from the *surface* of their respective planets (Mars' moons imaged by the *Curiosity* rover, 1 August 2013)\nIf viewed from Mars's surface near its equator, full Phobos looks about one-third as big as a full moon on Earth. It has an angular diameter of between 8' (rising) and 12' (overhead). Due to its close orbit, it would look smaller when the observer is further away from the Martian equator and is below the horizon and thus not visible from Mars's polar ice caps. Deimos looks more like a bright star or planet for an observer on Mars, only slightly bigger than Venus looks from Earth; it has an angular diameter of about 2'. The Sun's angular diameter as seen from Mars, by contrast, is about 21'. Thus there are no total solar eclipses on Mars, as the moons are far too small to completely cover the Sun. On the other hand, total lunar eclipses of Phobos happen almost every night.[25]\n\n\nThe motions of Phobos and Deimos would appear very different from that of Earth's Moon. Speedy Phobos rises in the west, sets in the east, and rises again in just eleven hours, while Deimos, being only just outside synchronous orbit, rises as expected in the east but very slowly. Despite its 30-hour orbit, it takes 2.7 days to set in the west as it slowly falls behind the rotation of Mars.\n\n\nBoth moons are tidally locked, always presenting the same face towards Mars. Since Phobos orbits Mars faster than the planet itself rotates, tidal forces are slowly but steadily decreasing its orbital radius. At some point in the future, when it falls within the Roche limit, Phobos will be broken up by these tidal forces and either crash into Mars or form a ring.[26][27] Several strings of craters on the Martian surface, inclined further from the equator the older they are, suggest that there may have been other small moons that suffered the fate expected of Phobos, and that the Martian crust as a whole shifted between these events.[28] Deimos, on the other hand, is far enough away that its orbit is being slowly boosted instead,[29] akin to Earth's Moon.\n\n\n\n\n### Orbital details[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Label  [note 1] | Name and pronunciation\n | Image\n | Diameter (km)\n | Surfacearea (km2)\n | Mass (kg)\n | Semi-majoraxis (km)\n | Orbitalperiod (h)\n | Average moonriseperiod (h, d)\n | Eccentricity\n | Inclination (°)[note 2] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| I\n | Phobos | /ˈfoʊbəs/*FOH-bəs* | ![](image) | 22.2 km (13.8 mi)(27×21.6×18.8 km)\n | 1,548 km2 | 10.7×1015 | 9,377 km (5,827 mi)\n | 7.66\n | 11.12 h (0.463 d)\n | 0.0151\n | 1.093\n |\n| II\n | Deimos | /ˈdaɪməs/*DY-məss* | ![](image) | 12.6 km (7.8 mi)(10×12×16 km)\n | 483 km2 | 1.5×1015 | 23,460 km (14,580 mi)\n | 30.31\n | 131 h (5.44 d)\n | 0.00033\n | 0.93\n |\n| ![](image)The relative sizes of and distance between Mars, Phobos, and Deimos, to scale\n*(Load the image in full size to see both Moons of Mars.)*\n |\n\n\n## Origin[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Animation illustrating the asteroid-belt origin for the moons\nThe origin of the Martian moons is still controversial.[31] Phobos and Deimos both have much in common with carbonaceous C-type asteroids, with spectra, albedo, and density very similar to those of C- or D-type asteroids.[32] Based on their similarity, one hypothesis is that both moons may be captured main-belt asteroids.[6][33] Both moons have very circular orbits which lie almost exactly in Mars's equatorial plane, and hence a capture origin requires a mechanism for circularizing the initially highly eccentric orbit, and adjusting its inclination into the equatorial plane, most probably by a combination of atmospheric drag and tidal forces,[34] although it is not clear that sufficient time is available for this to occur for Deimos.[31] Capture also requires dissipation of energy. The current atmosphere of Mars is too thin to capture a Phobos-sized object by atmospheric braking.[31] Geoffrey Landis has pointed out that the capture could have occurred if the original body was a binary asteroid that separated under tidal forces.[33]\n\n\nPhobos could be a second-generation Solar System object that coalesced in orbit after Mars formed, rather than forming concurrently out of the same birth cloud as Mars.[35]\n\n\nAnother hypothesis is that Mars was once surrounded by many Phobos- and Deimos-sized bodies, perhaps ejected into orbit around it by a collision with a large planetesimal.[36] The high porosity of the interior of Phobos (based on the density of 1.88 g/cm3, voids are estimated to comprise 25 to 35 percent of Phobos' volume) is inconsistent with an asteroidal origin.[37] Observations of Phobos in the thermal infrared suggest a composition containing mainly phyllosilicates, which are well known from the surface of Mars. The spectra are distinct from those of all classes of chondrite meteorites, again pointing away from an asteroidal origin.[38] Both sets of findings support an origin of Phobos from material ejected by an impact on Mars that reaccreted in Martian orbit,[39] similar to the prevailing theory for the origin of Earth's moon.\n\n\nThe moons of Mars may have started with a huge collision with a protoplanet one third the mass of Mars that formed a ring around Mars. The inner part of the ring formed a large moon. Gravitational interactions between this moon and the outer ring formed Phobos and Deimos. Later, the large moon crashed into Mars, but the two small moons remained in orbit. This theory agrees with the fine-grained surface of the moons and their high porosity. The outer disk would create fine-grained material.[40][41] Simulations suggest the object colliding with Mars had to be within the size range of Ceres and Vesta because a larger impact would have created a more massive disc and moons that would have prevented the survival of tiny moons like Phobos and Deimos.[42]\n\n\nMost recently, Amirhossein Bagheri and his colleagues from ETH Zurich and US Naval Observatory, proposed a new hypothesis on the origin of the moons. By analyzing the seismic and orbital data from Mars InSight Mission and other missions, they proposed that the moons are born from the disruption of a common parent body around 1 to 2.7 billion years ago. The common progenitor of Phobos and Deimos was most probably hit by another object and shattered to form Phobos and Deimos.[43] But a recent paper suggests that it seems unlikely that Phobos and Deimos are split directly from a single ancestral moon.[44] They use N-body simulations to show that the single ancestral moon scenario should result in an impact between the two moons, leading to a debris ring in 104 years.\n\n\n\n\n## Exploration[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Phobos (moon) § Exploration, and Deimos (moon) § Exploration\n\n### Past attempts and proposals[edit]\n\n\nWhile many Martian probes provided images and other data about Phobos and Deimos, only few were dedicated to these satellites and intended to perform a flyby or landing on the surface.\n\n\nTwo probes under the Soviet Phobos program were successfully launched in 1988, but neither conducted the intended jumping landings on Phobos and Deimos due to failures (although *Phobos 2* successfully photographed Phobos). The post-Soviet Russian *Fobos-Grunt* probe was intended to be the first sample return mission from Phobos, but a rocket failure left it stranded in Earth orbit in 2011. Efforts to reactivate the craft were unsuccessful, and it fell back to Earth in an uncontrolled re-entry on 15 January 2012, over the Pacific Ocean, west of Chile.[45][46][47]\n\n\nIn 1997 and 1998, the Aladdin mission was selected as a finalist in the NASA Discovery Program. The plan was to visit both Phobos and Deimos, and launch projectiles at the satellites. The probe would collect the ejecta as it performed a slow flyby.[*citation needed*] These samples would be returned to Earth for study three years later. Ultimately, NASA rejected this proposal in favor of *MESSENGER*, a probe to Mercury.\n\n\nIn 2007, the European Space Agency and EADS Astrium proposed and developed a mission to Phobos in 2016 with a lander and sample return, but this mission was never flown. Canadian Space Agency has been considering the Phobos Reconnaissance and International Mars Exploration (PRIME) mission to Phobos with orbiter and lander since 2007. Since 2013 NASA developed the Phobos Surveyor mission concept with an orbiter and a small rover.[48][49] NASA's PADME mission was designed to conduct multiple flybys of the Martian moons, but was not chosen for development.[50] Also, NASA is assessing the OSIRIS-REx II, concept mission for a sample return from Phobos.[51] Another sample return mission from Deimos, called *Gulliver*, has been conceptualized.[52]\n\n\n\n### Current proposals[edit]\n\n\nJAXA plans to launch Martian Moons eXploration (MMX) mission in 2024 to bring back the first samples from Phobos.[53][54] The spacecraft will enter orbit around Mars, then transfer to Phobos,[55] and land once or twice and gather sand-like regolith particles using a simple pneumatic system.[56] The lander mission aims to retrieve a minimum 10 g (0.35 oz) of samples.[57][58] The spacecraft will then take off from Phobos and make several flybys of the smaller moon Deimos before sending the Return Module back to Earth, arriving in July 2029.[55][53]\n\n\n\n## Gallery[edit]\n\n\n* ![Phobos, with Stickney Crater on the right (2003).](image)\n\nPhobos, with Stickney Crater on the right (2003).\n* ![Phobos (1998).[59]](image)\n\nPhobos (1998).[59]\n* ![Comparison - Phobos (top) and Deimos (bottom) (2005).](image)\n\nComparison - Phobos (top) and Deimos (bottom) (2005).\n\n\n![](image)Orbits of moons and spacecraft orbiting Mars.[60]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of missions to the moons of Mars\n* Mars trojan – Celestial bodies that share the orbit of Mars\n* Satellites of Mars\n* Transit of Deimos from Mars – Transit of a Moon of Mars\n* Transit of Phobos from Mars – Transit of a Moon from Mars\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^**  Label refers to the Roman numeral attributed to each moon in order of their discovery.[30]\n2. **^**  Orbital inclinations are given to Mars's equator.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Andrews, Robin George (25 July 2020). \"Why the 'Super Weird' Moons of Mars Fascinate Scientists - What's the big deal about little Phobos and tinier Deimos?\". *The New York Times*.

Ares, the god of war, was known to the Romans as Mars.\n\n\nCompared to the Earth's Moon, the moons Phobos and Deimos are small. Phobos has a diameter of 22.2 km (13.8 mi) and a mass of 1.08×1016 kg, while Deimos measures 12.6 km (7.8 mi) across, with a mass of 2.0×1015 kg. Phobos orbits closer to Mars, with a semi-major axis of 9,377 km (5,827 mi) and an orbital period of 7.66 hours; while Deimos orbits farther with a semi-major axis of 23,460 km (14,580 mi) and an orbital period of 30.35 hours.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Early speculation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*Curiosity's* view of the Martian moons: Phobos passing in front of Deimos – in *real-time* (video-gif, 1 August 2013)\nSpeculation about the existence of the moons of Mars had begun when the moons of Jupiter were discovered. When Galileo Galilei, as a hidden report about his having observed two bumps on the sides of Saturn (later discovered to be its rings), used the anagram *smaismrmilmepoetaleumibunenugttauiras* for *Altissimum planetam tergeminum observavi* (\"I have observed the most distant planet to have a triple form\"), Johannes Kepler had misinterpreted it to mean *Salve umbistineum geminatum Martia proles* (Hello, furious twins, sons of Mars).[4]\n\n\n\nPerhaps inspired by Kepler (and quoting Kepler's third law of planetary motion), Jonathan Swift's satire *Gulliver's Travels* (1726) refers to two moons in Part 3, Chapter 3 (the \"Voyage to Laputa\"), in which Laputa's astronomers are described as having discovered two satellites of Mars orbiting at distances of 3 and 5 Martian diameters with periods of 10 and 21.5 hours. Phobos and Deimos (both found in 1877, more than a century after Swift's novel) have actual orbital distances of 1.4 and 3.5 Martian diameters, and their respective orbital periods are 7.66 and 30.35 hours.[5][6] In the 20th century, V. G. Perminov, a spacecraft designer of early Soviet Mars and Venus spacecraft, speculated Swift found and deciphered records that Martians left on Earth.[7] However, the view of most astronomers is that Swift was simply employing a common argument of the time, that as the inner planets Venus and Mercury had no satellites, Earth had one and Jupiter had four (known at the time), that Mars by analogy must have two. Furthermore, as they had not yet been discovered, it was reasoned that they must be small and close to Mars. This would lead Swift to make a roughly accurate estimate of their orbital distances and revolution periods. In addition, Swift could have been helped in his calculations by his friend, the mathematician John Arbuthnot.[8]\n\n\nVoltaire's 1752 short story \"Micromégas\", about an alien visitor to Earth, also refers to two moons of Mars. Voltaire was presumably influenced by Swift.[9][10] In recognition of these 'predictions', two craters on Deimos are named Swift and Voltaire,[11][12] while on Phobos there is one named regio, *Laputa Regio*, and one named planitia, *Lagado Planitia*, both of which are named after places in *Gulliver's Travels* (the fictional Laputa, a flying island, and Lagado, imaginary capital of the fictional nation Balnibarbi).[13] Many of the craters on Phobos are also named after characters in *Gulliver's Travels*.[14]\n\n\n\n### Discovery[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The telescope used by Asaph Hall in the discovery of the Martian moons\nAsaph Hall discovered Deimos on 12 August 1877 at about 07:48 UTC and Phobos on 18 August 1877, at the US Naval Observatory (the Old Naval Observatory in Foggy Bottom) in Washington, D.C., at about 09:14 GMT (contemporary sources, using the pre-1925 astronomical convention that began the day at noon,[15] give the time of discovery as 11 August 14:40 and 17 August 16:06 Washington mean time respectively).[16][17][18] At the time, he was deliberately searching for Martian moons. Hall had previously seen what appeared to be a Martian moon on 10 August, but due to bad weather, he could not definitively identify them until later.\n\n\nHall recorded his discovery of Phobos in his notebook as follows:[19]\n\n\n\n\n> \n> \"I repeated the examination in the early part of the night of 11th [August 1877], and again found nothing, but trying again some hours later I found a faint object on the following side and a little north of the planet. I had barely time to secure an observation of its position when fog from the River stopped the work. This was at half-past two o'clock on the night of the 11th. Cloudy weather intervened for several days.\n> \"On 15 August the weather looking more promising, I slept at the Observatory. The sky cleared off with a thunderstorm at 11 o'clock and the search was resumed. The atmosphere however was in a very bad condition and Mars was so blazing and unsteady that nothing could be seen of the object, which we now know was at that time so near the planet as to be invisible.\n> \"On 16 August the object was found again on the following side of the planet, and the observations of that night showed that it was moving with the planet and if a satellite, was near one of its elongations. Until this time I had said nothing to anyone at the Observatory of my search for a satellite of Mars, but on leaving the observatory after these observations of the 16th, at about three o'clock in the morning, I told my assistant, George Anderson, to whom I had shown the object, that I thought I had discovered a satellite of Mars. I told him also to keep quiet as I did not wish anything said until the matter was beyond doubt. He said nothing, but the thing was too good to keep and I let it out myself. On 17 August between one and two o'clock, while I was reducing my observations, Professor Newcomb came into my room to eat his lunch and I showed him my measures of the faint object near Mars which proved that it was moving with the planet.\n> \"On 17 August while waiting and watching for the outer moon, the inner one was discovered. The observations of the 17th and 18th put beyond doubt the character of these objects and the discovery was publicly announced by Admiral Rodgers.\"\n> \n\n\nThe telescope used for the discovery was the 26-inch (66 cm) refractor (telescope with a lens) then located at Foggy Bottom.[20] In 1893 the lens was remounted and put in a new dome, where it remains into the 21st century.[21]\n\n\nThe names, originally spelled *Phobus* and *Deimus*, respectively, were suggested by Henry Madan (1838–1901), Science Master of Eton, from Book XV of the *Iliad*, where Ares summons Fear and Fright.[22] The granddaughter of Henry Madan's brother Falconer Madan was Venetia Burney, who first suggested the name of Pluto.\n\n\n\n### Mars moon hoax[edit]\n\n\nIn 1959, Walter Scott Houston perpetrated a celebrated April Fool's hoax in the April edition of the *Great Plains Observer*, claiming that \"Dr. Arthur Hayall of the University of the Sierras reports that the moons of Mars are actually artificial satellites\". Both Dr. Hayall and the University of the Sierras were fictitious. The hoax gained worldwide attention when Houston's claim was repeated in earnest by a Soviet scientist, Iosif Shklovsky,[23] who, based on a later-disproven density estimate, suggested Phobos was a hollow metal shell.\n\n\n\n### Recent surveys[edit]\n\n\nSearches have been conducted for additional satellites. In 2003, Scott S. Sheppard and David C. Jewitt surveyed nearly the entire Hill sphere of Mars for irregular satellites. However scattered light from Mars prevented them from searching the inner few arcminutes where the satellites Phobos and Deimos reside. No new satellites were found to an apparent limiting red magnitude of 23.5, which corresponds to radii of about 0.09 km using an albedo of 0.07.[24]\n\n\n\n## Characteristics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Apparent sizes of the moons of Mars, Deimos and Phobos, and the Moon as viewed from the *surface* of their respective planets (Mars' moons imaged by the *Curiosity* rover, 1 August 2013)\nIf viewed from Mars's surface near its equator, full Phobos looks about one-third as big as a full moon on Earth. It has an angular diameter of between 8' (rising) and 12' (overhead). Due to its close orbit, it would look smaller when the observer is further away from the Martian equator and is below the horizon and thus not visible from Mars's polar ice caps. Deimos looks more like a bright star or planet for an observer on Mars, only slightly bigger than Venus looks from Earth; it has an angular diameter of about 2'. The Sun's angular diameter as seen from Mars, by contrast, is about 21'. Thus there are no total solar eclipses on Mars, as the moons are far too small to completely cover the Sun. On the other hand, total lunar eclipses of Phobos happen almost every night.[25]\n\n\nThe motions of Phobos and Deimos would appear very different from that of Earth's Moon. Speedy Phobos rises in the west, sets in the east, and rises again in just eleven hours, while Deimos, being only just outside synchronous orbit, rises as expected in the east but very slowly. Despite its 30-hour orbit, it takes 2.7 days to set in the west as it slowly falls behind the rotation of Mars.\n\n\nBoth moons are tidally locked, always presenting the same face towards Mars. Since Phobos orbits Mars faster than the planet itself rotates, tidal forces are slowly but steadily decreasing its orbital radius. At some point in the future, when it falls within the Roche limit, Phobos will be broken up by these tidal forces and either crash into Mars or form a ring.[26][27] Several strings of craters on the Martian surface, inclined further from the equator the older they are, suggest that there may have been other small moons that suffered the fate expected of Phobos, and that the Martian crust as a whole shifted between these events.[28] Deimos, on the other hand, is far enough away that its orbit is being slowly boosted instead,[29] akin to Earth's Moon.\n\n\n\n\n### Orbital details[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Label  [note 1] | Name and pronunciation\n | Image\n | Diameter (km)\n | Surfacearea (km2)\n | Mass (kg)\n | Semi-majoraxis (km)\n | Orbitalperiod (h)\n | Average moonriseperiod (h, d)\n | Eccentricity\n | Inclination (°)[note 2] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| I\n | Phobos | /ˈfoʊbəs/*FOH-bəs* | ![](image) | 22.2 km (13.8 mi)(27×21.6×18.8 km)\n | 1,548 km2 | 10.7×1015 | 9,377 km (5,827 mi)\n | 7.66\n | 11.12 h (0.463 d)\n | 0.0151\n | 1.093\n |\n| II\n | Deimos | /ˈdaɪməs/*DY-məss* | ![](image) | 12.6 km (7.8 mi)(10×12×16 km)\n | 483 km2 | 1.5×1015 | 23,460 km (14,580 mi)\n | 30.31\n | 131 h (5.44 d)\n | 0.00033\n | 0.93\n |\n| ![](image)The relative sizes of and distance between Mars, Phobos, and Deimos, to scale\n*(Load the image in full size to see both Moons of Mars.)*\n |\n\n\n## Origin[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Animation illustrating the asteroid-belt origin for the moons\nThe origin of the Martian moons is still controversial.[31] Phobos and Deimos both have much in common with carbonaceous C-type asteroids, with spectra, albedo, and density very similar to those of C- or D-type asteroids.[32] Based on their similarity, one hypothesis is that both moons may be captured main-belt asteroids.[6][33] Both moons have very circular orbits which lie almost exactly in Mars's equatorial plane, and hence a capture origin requires a mechanism for circularizing the initially highly eccentric orbit, and adjusting its inclination into the equatorial plane, most probably by a combination of atmospheric drag and tidal forces,[34] although it is not clear that sufficient time is available for this to occur for Deimos.[31] Capture also requires dissipation of energy. The current atmosphere of Mars is too thin to capture a Phobos-sized object by atmospheric braking.[31] Geoffrey Landis has pointed out that the capture could have occurred if the original body was a binary asteroid that separated under tidal forces.[33]\n\n\nPhobos could be a second-generation Solar System object that coalesced in orbit after Mars formed, rather than forming concurrently out of the same birth cloud as Mars.[35]\n\n\nAnother hypothesis is that Mars was once surrounded by many Phobos- and Deimos-sized bodies, perhaps ejected into orbit around it by a collision with a large planetesimal.[36] The high porosity of the interior of Phobos (based on the density of 1.88 g/cm3, voids are estimated to comprise 25 to 35 percent of Phobos' volume) is inconsistent with an asteroidal origin.[37] Observations of Phobos in the thermal infrared suggest a composition containing mainly phyllosilicates, which are well known from the surface of Mars. The spectra are distinct from those of all classes of chondrite meteorites, again pointing away from an asteroidal origin.[38] Both sets of findings support an origin of Phobos from material ejected by an impact on Mars that reaccreted in Martian orbit,[39] similar to the prevailing theory for the origin of Earth's moon.\n\n\nThe moons of Mars may have started with a huge collision with a protoplanet one third the mass of Mars that formed a ring around Mars. The inner part of the ring formed a large moon. Gravitational interactions between this moon and the outer ring formed Phobos and Deimos. Later, the large moon crashed into Mars, but the two small moons remained in orbit. This theory agrees with the fine-grained surface of the moons and their high porosity. The outer disk would create fine-grained material.[40][41] Simulations suggest the object colliding with Mars had to be within the size range of Ceres and Vesta because a larger impact would have created a more massive disc and moons that would have prevented the survival of tiny moons like Phobos and Deimos.[42]\n\n\nMost recently, Amirhossein Bagheri and his colleagues from ETH Zurich and US Naval Observatory, proposed a new hypothesis on the origin of the moons. By analyzing the seismic and orbital data from Mars InSight Mission and other missions, they proposed that the moons are born from the disruption of a common parent body around 1 to 2.7 billion years ago. The common progenitor of Phobos and Deimos was most probably hit by another object and shattered to form Phobos and Deimos.[43] But a recent paper suggests that it seems unlikely that Phobos and Deimos are split directly from a single ancestral moon.[44] They use N-body simulations to show that the single ancestral moon scenario should result in an impact between the two moons, leading to a debris ring in 104 years.\n\n\n\n\n## Exploration[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Phobos (moon) § Exploration, and Deimos (moon) § Exploration\n\n### Past attempts and proposals[edit]\n\n\nWhile many Martian probes provided images and other data about Phobos and Deimos, only few were dedicated to these satellites and intended to perform a flyby or landing on the surface.\n\n\nTwo probes under the Soviet Phobos program were successfully launched in 1988, but neither conducted the intended jumping landings on Phobos and Deimos due to failures (although *Phobos 2* successfully photographed Phobos). The post-Soviet Russian *Fobos-Grunt* probe was intended to be the first sample return mission from Phobos, but a rocket failure left it stranded in Earth orbit in 2011. Efforts to reactivate the craft were unsuccessful, and it fell back to Earth in an uncontrolled re-entry on 15 January 2012, over the Pacific Ocean, west of Chile.[45][46][47]\n\n\nIn 1997 and 1998, the Aladdin mission was selected as a finalist in the NASA Discovery Program. The plan was to visit both Phobos and Deimos, and launch projectiles at the satellites. The probe would collect the ejecta as it performed a slow flyby.[*citation needed*] These samples would be returned to Earth for study three years later. Ultimately, NASA rejected this proposal in favor of *MESSENGER*, a probe to Mercury.\n\n\nIn 2007, the European Space Agency and EADS Astrium proposed and developed a mission to Phobos in 2016 with a lander and sample return, but this mission was never flown. Canadian Space Agency has been considering the Phobos Reconnaissance and International Mars Exploration (PRIME) mission to Phobos with orbiter and lander since 2007. Since 2013 NASA developed the Phobos Surveyor mission concept with an orbiter and a small rover.[48][49] NASA's PADME mission was designed to conduct multiple flybys of the Martian moons, but was not chosen for development.[50] Also, NASA is assessing the OSIRIS-REx II, concept mission for a sample return from Phobos.[51] Another sample return mission from Deimos, called *Gulliver*, has been conceptualized.[52]\n\n\n\n### Current proposals[edit]\n\n\nJAXA plans to launch Martian Moons eXploration (MMX) mission in 2024 to bring back the first samples from Phobos.[53][54] The spacecraft will enter orbit around Mars, then transfer to Phobos,[55] and land once or twice and gather sand-like regolith particles using a simple pneumatic system.[56] The lander mission aims to retrieve a minimum 10 g (0.35 oz) of samples.[57][58] The spacecraft will then take off from Phobos and make several flybys of the smaller moon Deimos before sending the Return Module back to Earth, arriving in July 2029.[55][53]\n\n\n\n## Gallery[edit]\n\n\n* ![Phobos, with Stickney Crater on the right (2003).](image)\n\nPhobos, with Stickney Crater on the right (2003).\n* ![Phobos (1998).[59]](image)\n\nPhobos (1998).[59]\n* ![Comparison - Phobos (top) and Deimos (bottom) (2005).](image)\n\nComparison - Phobos (top) and Deimos (bottom) (2005).\n\n\n![](image)Orbits of moons and spacecraft orbiting Mars.[60]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of missions to the moons of Mars\n* Mars trojan – Celestial bodies that share the orbit of Mars\n* Satellites of Mars\n* Transit of Deimos from Mars – Transit of a Moon of Mars\n* Transit of Phobos from Mars – Transit of a Moon from Mars\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^**  Label refers to the Roman numeral attributed to each moon in order of their discovery.[30]\n2. **^**  Orbital inclinations are given to Mars's equator.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Andrews, Robin George (25 July 2020). \"Why the 'Super Weird' Moons of Mars Fascinate Scientists - What's the big deal about little Phobos and tinier Deimos?\". *The New York Times*.

The most massive of the moons are the four Galilean moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto, which were independently discovered in 1610 by Galileo Galilei and Simon Marius and were the first objects found to orbit a body that was neither Earth nor the Sun. Much more recently, beginning in 1892, dozens of far smaller Jovian moons have been detected and have received the names of lovers (or other sexual partners) or daughters of the Roman god Jupiter or his Greek equivalent Zeus. The Galilean moons are by far the largest and most massive objects to orbit Jupiter, with the remaining 91 known moons and the rings together composing just 0.003% of the total orbiting mass.\n\n\nOf Jupiter's moons, eight are regular satellites with prograde and nearly circular orbits that are not greatly inclined with respect to Jupiter's equatorial plane. The Galilean satellites are nearly spherical in shape due to their planetary mass, and are just massive enough that they would be considered major planets if they were in direct orbit around the Sun. The other four regular satellites, known as the inner moons, are much smaller and closer to Jupiter; these serve as sources of the dust that makes up Jupiter's rings. The remainder of Jupiter's moons are outer irregular satellites whose prograde and retrograde orbits are much farther from Jupiter and have high inclinations and eccentricities. The largest of these moons were likely asteroids that were captured from solar orbits by Jupiter before impacts with other small bodies shattered them into many kilometer-sized fragments, forming collisional families of moons sharing similar orbits. Jupiter is expected to have about 100 irregular moons larger than 1 km (0.6 mi) in diameter, plus around 500 more smaller retrograde moons down to diameters of 0.8 km (0.5 mi).[5] Of the 87 known irregular moons of Jupiter, 38 of them have not yet been officially named.\n\n\n\n\n## Characteristics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Galilean moons. From left to right, in order of increasing distance from Jupiter: Io; Europa; Ganymede; Callisto.\nThe physical and orbital characteristics of the moons vary widely. The four Galileans are all over 3,100 kilometres (1,900 mi) in diameter; the largest Galilean, Ganymede, is the ninth largest object in the Solar System, after the Sun and seven of the planets, Ganymede being larger than Mercury. All other Jovian moons are less than 250 kilometres (160 mi) in diameter, with most barely exceeding 5 kilometres (3.1 mi).[note 2] Their orbital shapes range from nearly perfectly circular to highly eccentric and inclined, and many revolve in the direction opposite to Jupiter's rotation (retrograde motion). Orbital periods range from seven hours (taking less time than Jupiter does to rotate around its axis), to almost three Earth years.\n\n\n\n## Origin and evolution[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The relative masses of the Jovian moons. Those smaller than Europa are not visible at this scale, and combined would only be visible at 100× magnification.\nJupiter's regular satellites are believed to have formed from a circumplanetary disk, a ring of accreting gas and solid debris analogous to a protoplanetary disk.[6][7] They may be the remnants of a score of Galilean-mass satellites that formed early in Jupiter's history.[6][8]\n\n\nSimulations suggest that, while the disk had a relatively high mass at any given moment, over time a substantial fraction (several tens of a percent) of the mass of Jupiter captured from the solar nebula was passed through it. However, only 2% of the proto-disk mass of Jupiter is required to explain the existing satellites.[6] Thus, several generations of Galilean-mass satellites may have been in Jupiter's early history. Each generation of moons might have spiraled into Jupiter, because of drag from the disk, with new moons then forming from the new debris captured from the solar nebula.[6] By the time the present (possibly fifth) generation formed, the disk had thinned so that it no longer greatly interfered with the moons' orbits.[8] The current Galilean moons were still affected, falling into and being partially protected by an orbital resonance with each other, which still exists for Io, Europa, and Ganymede: they are in a 1:2:4 resonance. Ganymede's larger mass means that it would have migrated inward at a faster rate than Europa or Io.[6] Tidal dissipation in the Jovian system is still ongoing and Callisto will likely be captured into the resonance in about 1.5 billion years, creating a 1:2:4:8 chain.[9]\n\n\nThe outer, irregular moons are thought to have originated from captured asteroids, whereas the protolunar disk was still massive enough to absorb much of their momentum and thus capture them into orbit. Many are believed to have been broken up by mechanical stresses during capture, or afterward by collisions with other small bodies, producing the moons we see today.[10]\n\n\n\n## History and discovery[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Timeline of discovery of Solar System planets and their moons\n\n### Visual observations[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jupiter and the Galilean moons as seen through a 25 cm (10 in) Meade LX200 telescope\nChinese historian Xi Zezong claimed that the earliest record of a Jovian moon (Ganymede or Callisto) was a note by Chinese astronomer Gan De of an observation around 364 BC regarding a \"reddish star\".[11] However, the first certain observations of Jupiter's satellites were those of Galileo Galilei in 1609.[12] By January 1610, he had sighted the four massive Galilean moons with his 20× magnification telescope, and he published his results in March 1610.[13]\n\n\nSimon Marius had independently discovered the moons one day after Galileo, although he did not publish his book on the subject until 1614. Even so, the names Marius assigned are used today: Ganymede, Callisto, Io, and Europa.[14] No additional satellites were discovered until E. E. Barnard observed Amalthea in 1892.[15]\n\n\n\n### Photographic and spacecraft observations[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*Voyager 1* discovery image of the inner moon Metis on 4 March 1979, showing the moon's tiny silhouette against the backdrop of Jupiter's clouds\nWith the aid of telescopic photography with photographic plates, further discoveries followed quickly over the course of the 20th century. Himalia was discovered in 1904,[16] Elara in 1905,[17] Pasiphae in 1908,[18] Sinope in 1914,[19] Lysithea and Carme in 1938,[20] Ananke in 1951,[21] and Leda in 1974.[22]\n\n\nBy the time that the Voyager space probes reached Jupiter, around 1979, thirteen moons had been discovered, not including Themisto, which had been observed in 1975,[23] but was lost until 2000 due to insufficient initial observation data. The Voyager spacecraft discovered an additional three inner moons in 1979: Metis, Adrastea, and Thebe.[24]\n\n\n\n### Digital telescopic observations[edit]\n\n\nNo additional moons were discovered until two decades later, with the fortuitous discovery of Callirrhoe by the Spacewatch survey in October 1999.[25] During the 1990s, photographic plates phased out as digital charge-coupled device (CCD) cameras began emerging in telescopes on Earth, allowing for wide-field surveys of the sky at unprecedented sensitivities and ushering in a wave of new moon discoveries.[26] Scott Sheppard, then a graduate student of David Jewitt, demonstrated this extended capability of CCD cameras in a survey conducted with the Mauna Kea Observatory's 2.2-meter (88 in) UH88 telescope in November 2000, discovering eleven new irregular moons of Jupiter including the previously lost Themisto with the aid of automated computer algorithms.[27]\n\n\nFrom 2001 onward, Sheppard and Jewitt alongside other collaborators continued surveying for Jovian irregular moons with the 3.6-meter (12 ft) Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT), discovering an additional eleven in December 2001, one in October 2002, and nineteen in February 2003.[27][1] At the same time, another independent team led by Brett J. Gladman also used the CFHT in 2003 to search for Jovian irregular moons, discovering four and co-discovering two with Sheppard.[1][28][29] From the start to end of these CCD-based surveys in 2000–2004, Jupiter's known moon count had grown from 17 to 63.[25][28] All of these moons discovered after 2000 are faint and tiny, with apparent magnitudes between 22–23 and diameters less than 10 km (6.2 mi).[27] As a result, many could not be reliably tracked and ended up becoming lost.[30]\n\n\nBeginning in 2009, a team of astronomers, namely Mike Alexandersen, Marina Brozović, Brett Gladman, Robert Jacobson, and Christian Veillet, began a campaign to recover Jupiter's lost irregular moons using the CFHT and Palomar Observatory's 5.1-meter (17 ft) Hale Telescope.[31][30] They discovered two previously unknown Jovian irregular moons during recovery efforts in September 2010, prompting further follow-up observations to confirm these by 2011.[31][32] One of these moons, S/2010 J 2 (now Jupiter LII), has an apparent magnitude of 24 and a diameter of only 1–2 km (0.62–1.2 mi), making it one of the faintest and smallest confirmed moons of Jupiter even as of 2023[update].[33][4] Meanwhile, in September 2011, Scott Sheppard, now a faculty member of the Carnegie Institution for Science,[4] discovered two more irregular moons using the institution's 6.5-meter (21 ft) Magellan Telescopes at Las Campanas Observatory, raising Jupiter's known moon count to 67.[34] Although Sheppard's two moons were followed up and confirmed by 2012, both became lost due to insufficient observational coverage.[30][35]\n\n\nIn 2016, while surveying for distant trans-Neptunian objects with the Magellan Telescopes, Sheppard serendipitously observed a region of the sky located near Jupiter, enticing him to search for Jovian irregular moons as a detour. In collaboration with Chadwick Trujillo and David Tholen, Sheppard continued surveying around Jupiter from 2016 to 2018 using the Cerro Tololo Observatory's 4.0-meter (13 ft) Víctor M. Blanco Telescope and Mauna Kea Observatory's 8.2-meter (27 ft) Subaru Telescope.[36][37] In the process, Sheppard's team recovered several lost moons of Jupiter from 2003 to 2011 and reported two new Jovian irregular moons in June 2017.[38] Then in July 2018, Sheppard's team announced ten more irregular moons confirmed from 2016 to 2018 observations, bringing Jupiter's known moon count to 79. Among these was Valetudo, which has an unusually distant prograde orbit that crosses paths with the retrograde irregular moons.[36][37] Several more unidentified Jovian irregular satellites were detected in Sheppard's 2016–2018 search, but were too faint for follow-up confirmation.[37][39]: 10\n\n\nFrom November 2021 to January 2023, Sheppard discovered twelve more irregular moons of Jupiter and confirmed them in archival survey imagery from 2003 to 2018, bringing the total count to 92.[40][2][3] Among these was S/2018 J 4, a highly-inclined prograde moon that is now known to be in same orbital grouping as the moon Carpo, which was previously thought to be solitary.[3] On 22 February 2023, Sheppard announced three more moons discovered in a 2022 survey, now bringing Jupiter's total known moon count to 95.[2] In a February 2023 interview with *NPR*, Sheppard noted that he and his team are currently tracking even more moons of Jupiter, which should place Jupiter's moon count over 100 once confirmed over the next two years.[41]\n\n\nMany more irregular moons of Jupiter will inevitably be discovered in the future, especially after the beginning of deep sky surveys by the upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory and Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope in the mid-2020s.[42][43] The Rubin Observatory's 8.4-meter (28 ft) aperture telescope and 3.5 square-degree field of view will probe Jupiter's irregular moons down to diameters of 1 km (0.6 mi)[10]: 265 at apparent magnitudes of 24.5, with the potential of increasing the known population by up to tenfold.[42]: 292 Likewise, the Roman Space Telescope's 2.4-meter (7.9 ft) aperture and 0.28 square-degree field of view will probe Jupiter's irregular moons down to diameters of 0.3 km (0.2 mi) at magnitude 27.7, with the potential of discovering approximately 1,000 Jovian moons above this size.[43]: 24 Discovering these many irregular satellites will help reveal their population's size distribution and collisional histories, which will place further constraints to how the Solar System formed.[43]: 24–25\n\n\n**Discovery of outer planet moons**\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

The astronomical literature instead simply referred to \"Jupiter I\", \"Jupiter II\", etc., or \"the first satellite of Jupiter\", \"Jupiter's second satellite\", and so on.[44] The names Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto became popular in the mid-20th century,[45] whereas the rest of the moons remained unnamed and were usually numbered in Roman numerals V (5) to XII (12).[46][47] Jupiter V was discovered in 1892 and given the name *Amalthea* by a popular though unofficial convention, a name first used by French astronomer Camille Flammarion.[48][49]\n\n\nThe other moons were simply labeled by their Roman numeral (e.g. Jupiter IX) in the majority of astronomical literature until the 1970s.[50] Several different suggestions were made for names of Jupiter's outer satellites, but none were universally accepted until 1975 when the International Astronomical Union's (IAU) Task Group for Outer Solar System Nomenclature granted names to satellites V–XIII,[51] and provided for a formal naming process for future satellites still to be discovered.[51] The practice was to name newly discovered moons of Jupiter after lovers and favorites of the god Jupiter (Zeus) and, since 2004, also after their descendants.[48] All of Jupiter's satellites from XXXIV (Euporie) onward are named after descendants of Jupiter or Zeus,[48] except LIII (Dia), named after a lover of Jupiter. Names ending with \"a\" or \"o\" are used for prograde irregular satellites (the latter for highly inclined satellites), and names ending with \"e\" are used for retrograde irregulars.[26] With the discovery of smaller, kilometre-sized moons around Jupiter, the IAU has established an additional convention to limit the naming of small moons with absolute magnitudes greater than 18 or diameters smaller than 1 km (0.6 mi).[52] Some of the most recently confirmed moons have not received names.[4]\n\n\nSome asteroids share the same names as moons of Jupiter: 9 Metis, 38 Leda, 52 Europa, 85 Io, 113 Amalthea, 239 Adrastea. Two more asteroids previously shared the names of Jovian moons until spelling differences were made permanent by the IAU: Ganymede and asteroid 1036 Ganymed; and Callisto and asteroid 204 Kallisto.\n\n\n\n## Groups[edit]\n\n\n### Regular satellites[edit]\n\n\nThese have prograde and nearly circular orbits of low inclination and are split into two groups:\n\n\n\n* ***Inner satellites*** or ***Amalthea group***: Metis, Adrastea, Amalthea, and Thebe. These orbit very close to Jupiter; the innermost two orbit in less than a Jovian day. The latter two are respectively the fifth and seventh largest moons in the Jovian system. Observations suggest that at least the largest member, Amalthea, did not form on its present orbit, but farther from the planet, or that it is a captured Solar System body.[53] These moons, along with a number of seen and as-yet-unseen inner moonlets (see Amalthea moonlets), replenish and maintain Jupiter's faint ring system. Metis and Adrastea help to maintain Jupiter's main ring, whereas Amalthea and Thebe each maintain their own faint outer rings.[54][55]\n* *Main group* or *Galilean moons*: Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto. They are some of the largest objects in the Solar System outside the Sun and the eight planets in terms of mass, larger than any known dwarf planet. Ganymede exceeds (and Callisto nearly equals) even the planet Mercury in diameter, though they are less massive. They are respectively the fourth-, sixth-, first-, and third-largest natural satellites in the Solar System, containing approximately 99.997% of the total mass in orbit around Jupiter, while Jupiter is almost 5,000 times more massive than the Galilean moons.[note 3] The inner moons are in a 1:2:4 orbital resonance. Models suggest that they formed by slow accretion in the low-density Jovian subnebula—a disc of the gas and dust that existed around Jupiter after its formation—which lasted up to 10 million years in the case of Callisto.[56] Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto are suspected of having subsurface water oceans,[57][58] and Io may have a subsurface magma ocean.[59]\n\n\n### Irregular satellites[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Orbits and positions of Jupiter's irregular satellites as of 1 January 2021. Prograde orbits are colored blue while retrograde orbits are colored red.\nMain article: Irregular satellite\n\nThe irregular satellites are substantially smaller objects with more distant and eccentric orbits. They form families with shared similarities in orbit (semi-major axis, inclination, eccentricity) and composition; it is believed that these are at least partially collisional families that were created when larger (but still small) parent bodies were shattered by impacts from asteroids captured by Jupiter's gravitational field. These families bear the names of their largest members. The identification of satellite families is tentative, but the following are typically listed:[4][60][61]\n\n\n\n* Prograde satellites:\n\t+ Themisto is the innermost irregular moon and is not part of a known family.[4][60]\n\t+ The Himalia group is confined within semi-major axes between 11–12 million km (6.8–7.5 million mi), inclinations between 27–29°, and eccentricities between 0.12 and 0.21.[62] It has been suggested that the group could be a remnant of the break-up of an asteroid from the asteroid belt.[60]\n\t+ The Carpo group includes two known moons on very high orbital inclinations of 50° and semi-major axes between 16–17 million km (9.9–10.6 million mi).[4] Due to their exceptionally high inclinations, the moons of the Carpo group are subject to gravitational perturbations that induce the Lidov–Kozai resonance in their orbits, which cause their eccentricities and inclinations to periodically oscillate in correspondence with each other.[35] The Lidov–Kozai resonance can significantly alter the orbits of these moons: for example, the eccentricity and inclination of the group's namesake Carpo can fluctuate between 0.19–0.69 and 44–59°, respectively.[35]\n\t+ Valetudo is the outermost prograde moon and is not part of a known family. Its prograde orbit crosses paths with several moons that have retrograde orbits and may in the future collide with them.[37]\n* Retrograde satellites:\n\t+ The Carme group is tightly confined within semi-major axes between 22–24 million km (14–15 million mi), inclinations between 164–166°, and eccentricities between 0.25 and 0.28.[62] It is very homogeneous in color (light red) and is believed to have originated as collisional fragments from a D-type asteroid progenitor, possibly a Jupiter trojan.[27]\n\t+ The Ananke group has a relatively wider spread than the previous groups, with semi-major axes between 19–22 million km (12–14 million mi), inclinations between 144–156°, and eccentricities between 0.09 and 0.25.[62] Most of the members appear gray, and are believed to have formed from the breakup of a captured asteroid.[27]\n\t+ The Pasiphae group is quite dispersed, with semi-major axes spread over 22–25 million km (14–16 million mi), inclinations between 141° and 157°, and higher eccentricities between 0.23 and 0.44.[62] The colors also vary significantly, from red to grey, which might be the result of multiple collisions. Sinope, sometimes included in the Pasiphae group,[27] is red and, given the difference in inclination, it could have been captured independently;[60] Pasiphae and Sinope are also trapped in secular resonances with Jupiter.[63]\n\n\nBased on their survey discoveries in 2000–2003, Sheppard and Jewitt predicted that Jupiter should have approximately 100 irregular satellites larger than 1 km (0.6 mi) in diameter, or brighter than magnitude 24.[27]: 262 Survey observations by Alexandersen et al. in 2010–2011 agreed with this prediction, estimating that approximately 40 Jovian irregular satellites of this size remained undiscovered in 2012.[31]: 4\n\n\nIn September 2020, researchers from the University of British Columbia identified 45 candidate irregular moons from an analysis of archival images taken in 2010 by the CFHT.[64] These candidates were mainly small and faint, down to magnitude of 25.7 or above 0.8 km (0.5 mi) in diameter. From the number of candidate moons detected within a sky area of one square degree, the team extrapolated that the population of retrograde Jovian moons brighter than magnitude 25.7 is around 600+600  \n−300 within a factor of 2.[5]: 6 Although the team considers their characterized candidates to be likely moons of Jupiter, they all remain unconfirmed due to insufficient observation data for determining reliable orbits.[64] The true population of Jovian irregular moons is likely complete down to magnitude 23.2 at diameters over 3 km (1.9 mi) as of 2020[update].[5]: 6[31]: 4\n\n\n\n## List[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Orbital diagram of the orbital inclination and orbital distances for Jupiter's rings and moon system at various scales. Notable moons, moon groups, and rings are individually labeled. Open the image for full resolution.\nThe moons of Jupiter are listed below by orbital period. Moons massive enough for their surfaces to have collapsed into a spheroid are highlighted in bold. These are the four Galilean moons, which are comparable in size to the Moon. The other moons are much smaller, with the least massive Galilean moon being more than 7,000 times more massive than the most massive of the other moons. The irregular captured moons are shaded light gray and orange when prograde and yellow, red, and dark gray when retrograde.\n\n\nThe orbits and mean distances of the irregular moons are highly variable over short timescales due to frequent planetary and solar perturbations,[35] so proper orbital elements which are averaged over a period of time are preferably used. The proper orbital elements of the irregular moons listed here are averaged over a 400-year numerical integration by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory: for the above reasons, they may strongly differ from osculating orbital elements provided by other sources.[62] Otherwise, recently-discovered irregular moons without published proper elements are temporarily listed here with inaccurate osculating orbital elements that are *italicized* to distinguish them from other irregular moons with proper orbital elements. Some of the irregular moons' proper orbital periods in this list may not scale accordingly with their proper semi-major axes due to the aforementioned perturbations. The irregular moons' proper orbital elements are all based on the reference epoch of 1 January 2000.[62]\n\n\nSome irregular moons have only been observed briefly for a year or two, but their orbits are known accurately enough that they will not be lost to positional uncertainties.[35][4] As of February 2023[update], only three known moons of Jupiter—S/2022 J 1, S/2022 J 2, and S/2022 J 3—have observation arcs shorter than one year and are therefore at risk of becoming lost.[4]\n\n\n\n| Key\n |\n| --- |\n|  Inner moons\n | ♠ Galilean moons | † Themisto group\n | ♣ Himalia group | § Carpo

(moon) § Observational history\n\n![](image)The orbit and motion of the Galilean moons around Jupiter, as captured by JunoCam aboard the *Juno* spacecraft.\n![](image)Ganymede taken by Juno during its 34th perijove.\nNine spacecraft have visited Jupiter. The first were *Pioneer 10* in 1973, and *Pioneer 11* a year later, taking low-resolution images of the four Galilean moons and returning data on their atmospheres and radiation belts.[72] The *Voyager 1* and *Voyager 2* probes visited Jupiter in 1979, discovering the volcanic activity on Io and the presence of water ice on the surface of Europa. *Ulysses* further studied Jupiter's magnetosphere in 1992 and then again in 2000.\n\n\nThe *Galileo* spacecraft was the first to enter orbit around Jupiter, arriving in 1995 and studying it until 2003. During this period, *Galileo* gathered a large amount of information about the Jovian system, making close approaches to all of the Galilean moons and finding evidence for thin atmospheres on three of them, as well as the possibility of liquid water beneath the surfaces of Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. It also discovered a magnetic field around Ganymede.\n\n\nThen the *Cassini* probe to Saturn flew by Jupiter in 2000 and collected data on interactions of the Galilean moons with Jupiter's extended atmosphere. The *New Horizons* spacecraft flew by Jupiter in 2007 and made improved measurements of its satellites' orbital parameters.\n\n\nIn 2016, the *Juno* spacecraft imaged the Galilean moons from above their orbital plane as it approached Jupiter orbit insertion, creating a time-lapse movie of their motion.[73] With a mission extension, *Juno* has since begun close flybys of the Galileans, flying by Ganymede in 2021 followed by Europa and Io in 2022. It is planned to fly by Io again in late 2023 and once more in 2024.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Jupiter's moons in fiction\n* Satellite system (astronomy)\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The most-recently announced moons of Jupiter are S/2022 J 1, S/2022 J 2, and S/2022 J 3, published in MPECs 2023-D44 to 2023-D46.[2] These add three more to the previous count of 92 from January 2023, bringing the total up to 95.[3]\n2. **^** For comparison, the area of a sphere with diameter 250 km is about the area of Senegal and comparable to the area of Belarus, Syria and Uruguay. The area of a sphere with a diameter of 5 km is about the area of Guernsey and somewhat more than the area of San Marino. (But note that these smaller moons are not spherical.)\n3. **^** Jupiter Mass of 1.8986 × 1027 kg / Mass of Galilean moons 3.93 × 1023 kg = 4,828\n4. **^** Label refers to the Roman numeral attributed to each moon in order of their naming.\n5. **^** Diameters with multiple entries such as \"60 × 40 × 34\" reflect that the body is not a perfect spheroid and that each of its dimensions has been measured well enough.\n6. **^** The only satellites with measured masses are Amalthea, Himalia, and the four Galilean moons. The masses of the inner satellites are estimated by assuming a density similar to Amalthea's (0.86 g/cm3), while the rest of the irregular satellites are estimated by assuming a spherical volume and a density of 1 g/cm3.\n7. **^** Periods with negative values are retrograde.\n8. **^** \"?\" refers to group assignments that are not considered sure yet.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** \"Planetary Satellite Discovery Circumstances\". *JPL Solar System Dynamics*.

The most massive of the moons are the four Galilean moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto, which were independently discovered in 1610 by Galileo Galilei and Simon Marius and were the first objects found to orbit a body that was neither Earth nor the Sun. Much more recently, beginning in 1892, dozens of far smaller Jovian moons have been detected and have received the names of lovers (or other sexual partners) or daughters of the Roman god Jupiter or his Greek equivalent Zeus. The Galilean moons are by far the largest and most massive objects to orbit Jupiter, with the remaining 91 known moons and the rings together composing just 0.003% of the total orbiting mass.\n\n\nOf Jupiter's moons, eight are regular satellites with prograde and nearly circular orbits that are not greatly inclined with respect to Jupiter's equatorial plane. The Galilean satellites are nearly spherical in shape due to their planetary mass, and are just massive enough that they would be considered major planets if they were in direct orbit around the Sun. The other four regular satellites, known as the inner moons, are much smaller and closer to Jupiter; these serve as sources of the dust that makes up Jupiter's rings. The remainder of Jupiter's moons are outer irregular satellites whose prograde and retrograde orbits are much farther from Jupiter and have high inclinations and eccentricities. The largest of these moons were likely asteroids that were captured from solar orbits by Jupiter before impacts with other small bodies shattered them into many kilometer-sized fragments, forming collisional families of moons sharing similar orbits. Jupiter is expected to have about 100 irregular moons larger than 1 km (0.6 mi) in diameter, plus around 500 more smaller retrograde moons down to diameters of 0.8 km (0.5 mi).[5] Of the 87 known irregular moons of Jupiter, 38 of them have not yet been officially named.\n\n\n\n\n## Characteristics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Galilean moons. From left to right, in order of increasing distance from Jupiter: Io; Europa; Ganymede; Callisto.\nThe physical and orbital characteristics of the moons vary widely. The four Galileans are all over 3,100 kilometres (1,900 mi) in diameter; the largest Galilean, Ganymede, is the ninth largest object in the Solar System, after the Sun and seven of the planets, Ganymede being larger than Mercury. All other Jovian moons are less than 250 kilometres (160 mi) in diameter, with most barely exceeding 5 kilometres (3.1 mi).[note 2] Their orbital shapes range from nearly perfectly circular to highly eccentric and inclined, and many revolve in the direction opposite to Jupiter's rotation (retrograde motion). Orbital periods range from seven hours (taking less time than Jupiter does to rotate around its axis), to almost three Earth years.\n\n\n\n## Origin and evolution[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The relative masses of the Jovian moons. Those smaller than Europa are not visible at this scale, and combined would only be visible at 100× magnification.\nJupiter's regular satellites are believed to have formed from a circumplanetary disk, a ring of accreting gas and solid debris analogous to a protoplanetary disk.[6][7] They may be the remnants of a score of Galilean-mass satellites that formed early in Jupiter's history.[6][8]\n\n\nSimulations suggest that, while the disk had a relatively high mass at any given moment, over time a substantial fraction (several tens of a percent) of the mass of Jupiter captured from the solar nebula was passed through it. However, only 2% of the proto-disk mass of Jupiter is required to explain the existing satellites.[6] Thus, several generations of Galilean-mass satellites may have been in Jupiter's early history. Each generation of moons might have spiraled into Jupiter, because of drag from the disk, with new moons then forming from the new debris captured from the solar nebula.[6] By the time the present (possibly fifth) generation formed, the disk had thinned so that it no longer greatly interfered with the moons' orbits.[8] The current Galilean moons were still affected, falling into and being partially protected by an orbital resonance with each other, which still exists for Io, Europa, and Ganymede: they are in a 1:2:4 resonance. Ganymede's larger mass means that it would have migrated inward at a faster rate than Europa or Io.[6] Tidal dissipation in the Jovian system is still ongoing and Callisto will likely be captured into the resonance in about 1.5 billion years, creating a 1:2:4:8 chain.[9]\n\n\nThe outer, irregular moons are thought to have originated from captured asteroids, whereas the protolunar disk was still massive enough to absorb much of their momentum and thus capture them into orbit. Many are believed to have been broken up by mechanical stresses during capture, or afterward by collisions with other small bodies, producing the moons we see today.[10]\n\n\n\n## History and discovery[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Timeline of discovery of Solar System planets and their moons\n\n### Visual observations[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jupiter and the Galilean moons as seen through a 25 cm (10 in) Meade LX200 telescope\nChinese historian Xi Zezong claimed that the earliest record of a Jovian moon (Ganymede or Callisto) was a note by Chinese astronomer Gan De of an observation around 364 BC regarding a \"reddish star\".[11] However, the first certain observations of Jupiter's satellites were those of Galileo Galilei in 1609.[12] By January 1610, he had sighted the four massive Galilean moons with his 20× magnification telescope, and he published his results in March 1610.[13]\n\n\nSimon Marius had independently discovered the moons one day after Galileo, although he did not publish his book on the subject until 1614. Even so, the names Marius assigned are used today: Ganymede, Callisto, Io, and Europa.[14] No additional satellites were discovered until E. E. Barnard observed Amalthea in 1892.[15]\n\n\n\n### Photographic and spacecraft observations[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*Voyager 1* discovery image of the inner moon Metis on 4 March 1979, showing the moon's tiny silhouette against the backdrop of Jupiter's clouds\nWith the aid of telescopic photography with photographic plates, further discoveries followed quickly over the course of the 20th century. Himalia was discovered in 1904,[16] Elara in 1905,[17] Pasiphae in 1908,[18] Sinope in 1914,[19] Lysithea and Carme in 1938,[20] Ananke in 1951,[21] and Leda in 1974.[22]\n\n\nBy the time that the Voyager space probes reached Jupiter, around 1979, thirteen moons had been discovered, not including Themisto, which had been observed in 1975,[23] but was lost until 2000 due to insufficient initial observation data. The Voyager spacecraft discovered an additional three inner moons in 1979: Metis, Adrastea, and Thebe.[24]\n\n\n\n### Digital telescopic observations[edit]\n\n\nNo additional moons were discovered until two decades later, with the fortuitous discovery of Callirrhoe by the Spacewatch survey in October 1999.[25] During the 1990s, photographic plates phased out as digital charge-coupled device (CCD) cameras began emerging in telescopes on Earth, allowing for wide-field surveys of the sky at unprecedented sensitivities and ushering in a wave of new moon discoveries.[26] Scott Sheppard, then a graduate student of David Jewitt, demonstrated this extended capability of CCD cameras in a survey conducted with the Mauna Kea Observatory's 2.2-meter (88 in) UH88 telescope in November 2000, discovering eleven new irregular moons of Jupiter including the previously lost Themisto with the aid of automated computer algorithms.[27]\n\n\nFrom 2001 onward, Sheppard and Jewitt alongside other collaborators continued surveying for Jovian irregular moons with the 3.6-meter (12 ft) Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT), discovering an additional eleven in December 2001, one in October 2002, and nineteen in February 2003.[27][1] At the same time, another independent team led by Brett J. Gladman also used the CFHT in 2003 to search for Jovian irregular moons, discovering four and co-discovering two with Sheppard.[1][28][29] From the start to end of these CCD-based surveys in 2000–2004, Jupiter's known moon count had grown from 17 to 63.[25][28] All of these moons discovered after 2000 are faint and tiny, with apparent magnitudes between 22–23 and diameters less than 10 km (6.2 mi).[27] As a result, many could not be reliably tracked and ended up becoming lost.[30]\n\n\nBeginning in 2009, a team of astronomers, namely Mike Alexandersen, Marina Brozović, Brett Gladman, Robert Jacobson, and Christian Veillet, began a campaign to recover Jupiter's lost irregular moons using the CFHT and Palomar Observatory's 5.1-meter (17 ft) Hale Telescope.[31][30] They discovered two previously unknown Jovian irregular moons during recovery efforts in September 2010, prompting further follow-up observations to confirm these by 2011.[31][32] One of these moons, S/2010 J 2 (now Jupiter LII), has an apparent magnitude of 24 and a diameter of only 1–2 km (0.62–1.2 mi), making it one of the faintest and smallest confirmed moons of Jupiter even as of 2023[update].[33][4] Meanwhile, in September 2011, Scott Sheppard, now a faculty member of the Carnegie Institution for Science,[4] discovered two more irregular moons using the institution's 6.5-meter (21 ft) Magellan Telescopes at Las Campanas Observatory, raising Jupiter's known moon count to 67.[34] Although Sheppard's two moons were followed up and confirmed by 2012, both became lost due to insufficient observational coverage.[30][35]\n\n\nIn 2016, while surveying for distant trans-Neptunian objects with the Magellan Telescopes, Sheppard serendipitously observed a region of the sky located near Jupiter, enticing him to search for Jovian irregular moons as a detour. In collaboration with Chadwick Trujillo and David Tholen, Sheppard continued surveying around Jupiter from 2016 to 2018 using the Cerro Tololo Observatory's 4.0-meter (13 ft) Víctor M. Blanco Telescope and Mauna Kea Observatory's 8.2-meter (27 ft) Subaru Telescope.[36][37] In the process, Sheppard's team recovered several lost moons of Jupiter from 2003 to 2011 and reported two new Jovian irregular moons in June 2017.[38] Then in July 2018, Sheppard's team announced ten more irregular moons confirmed from 2016 to 2018 observations, bringing Jupiter's known moon count to 79. Among these was Valetudo, which has an unusually distant prograde orbit that crosses paths with the retrograde irregular moons.[36][37] Several more unidentified Jovian irregular satellites were detected in Sheppard's 2016–2018 search, but were too faint for follow-up confirmation.[37][39]: 10\n\n\nFrom November 2021 to January 2023, Sheppard discovered twelve more irregular moons of Jupiter and confirmed them in archival survey imagery from 2003 to 2018, bringing the total count to 92.[40][2][3] Among these was S/2018 J 4, a highly-inclined prograde moon that is now known to be in same orbital grouping as the moon Carpo, which was previously thought to be solitary.[3] On 22 February 2023, Sheppard announced three more moons discovered in a 2022 survey, now bringing Jupiter's total known moon count to 95.[2] In a February 2023 interview with *NPR*, Sheppard noted that he and his team are currently tracking even more moons of Jupiter, which should place Jupiter's moon count over 100 once confirmed over the next two years.[41]\n\n\nMany more irregular moons of Jupiter will inevitably be discovered in the future, especially after the beginning of deep sky surveys by the upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory and Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope in the mid-2020s.[42][43] The Rubin Observatory's 8.4-meter (28 ft) aperture telescope and 3.5 square-degree field of view will probe Jupiter's irregular moons down to diameters of 1 km (0.6 mi)[10]: 265 at apparent magnitudes of 24.5, with the potential of increasing the known population by up to tenfold.[42]: 292 Likewise, the Roman Space Telescope's 2.4-meter (7.9 ft) aperture and 0.28 square-degree field of view will probe Jupiter's irregular moons down to diameters of 0.3 km (0.2 mi) at magnitude 27.7, with the potential of discovering approximately 1,000 Jovian moons above this size.[43]: 24 Discovering these many irregular satellites will help reveal their population's size distribution and collisional histories, which will place further constraints to how the Solar System formed.[43]: 24–25\n\n\n**Discovery of outer planet moons**\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

The astronomical literature instead simply referred to \"Jupiter I\", \"Jupiter II\", etc., or \"the first satellite of Jupiter\", \"Jupiter's second satellite\", and so on.[44] The names Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto became popular in the mid-20th century,[45] whereas the rest of the moons remained unnamed and were usually numbered in Roman numerals V (5) to XII (12).[46][47] Jupiter V was discovered in 1892 and given the name *Amalthea* by a popular though unofficial convention, a name first used by French astronomer Camille Flammarion.[48][49]\n\n\nThe other moons were simply labeled by their Roman numeral (e.g. Jupiter IX) in the majority of astronomical literature until the 1970s.[50] Several different suggestions were made for names of Jupiter's outer satellites, but none were universally accepted until 1975 when the International Astronomical Union's (IAU) Task Group for Outer Solar System Nomenclature granted names to satellites V–XIII,[51] and provided for a formal naming process for future satellites still to be discovered.[51] The practice was to name newly discovered moons of Jupiter after lovers and favorites of the god Jupiter (Zeus) and, since 2004, also after their descendants.[48] All of Jupiter's satellites from XXXIV (Euporie) onward are named after descendants of Jupiter or Zeus,[48] except LIII (Dia), named after a lover of Jupiter. Names ending with \"a\" or \"o\" are used for prograde irregular satellites (the latter for highly inclined satellites), and names ending with \"e\" are used for retrograde irregulars.[26] With the discovery of smaller, kilometre-sized moons around Jupiter, the IAU has established an additional convention to limit the naming of small moons with absolute magnitudes greater than 18 or diameters smaller than 1 km (0.6 mi).[52] Some of the most recently confirmed moons have not received names.[4]\n\n\nSome asteroids share the same names as moons of Jupiter: 9 Metis, 38 Leda, 52 Europa, 85 Io, 113 Amalthea, 239 Adrastea. Two more asteroids previously shared the names of Jovian moons until spelling differences were made permanent by the IAU: Ganymede and asteroid 1036 Ganymed; and Callisto and asteroid 204 Kallisto.\n\n\n\n## Groups[edit]\n\n\n### Regular satellites[edit]\n\n\nThese have prograde and nearly circular orbits of low inclination and are split into two groups:\n\n\n\n* ***Inner satellites*** or ***Amalthea group***: Metis, Adrastea, Amalthea, and Thebe. These orbit very close to Jupiter; the innermost two orbit in less than a Jovian day. The latter two are respectively the fifth and seventh largest moons in the Jovian system. Observations suggest that at least the largest member, Amalthea, did not form on its present orbit, but farther from the planet, or that it is a captured Solar System body.[53] These moons, along with a number of seen and as-yet-unseen inner moonlets (see Amalthea moonlets), replenish and maintain Jupiter's faint ring system. Metis and Adrastea help to maintain Jupiter's main ring, whereas Amalthea and Thebe each maintain their own faint outer rings.[54][55]\n* *Main group* or *Galilean moons*: Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto. They are some of the largest objects in the Solar System outside the Sun and the eight planets in terms of mass, larger than any known dwarf planet. Ganymede exceeds (and Callisto nearly equals) even the planet Mercury in diameter, though they are less massive. They are respectively the fourth-, sixth-, first-, and third-largest natural satellites in the Solar System, containing approximately 99.997% of the total mass in orbit around Jupiter, while Jupiter is almost 5,000 times more massive than the Galilean moons.[note 3] The inner moons are in a 1:2:4 orbital resonance. Models suggest that they formed by slow accretion in the low-density Jovian subnebula—a disc of the gas and dust that existed around Jupiter after its formation—which lasted up to 10 million years in the case of Callisto.[56] Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto are suspected of having subsurface water oceans,[57][58] and Io may have a subsurface magma ocean.[59]\n\n\n### Irregular satellites[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Orbits and positions of Jupiter's irregular satellites as of 1 January 2021. Prograde orbits are colored blue while retrograde orbits are colored red.\nMain article: Irregular satellite\n\nThe irregular satellites are substantially smaller objects with more distant and eccentric orbits. They form families with shared similarities in orbit (semi-major axis, inclination, eccentricity) and composition; it is believed that these are at least partially collisional families that were created when larger (but still small) parent bodies were shattered by impacts from asteroids captured by Jupiter's gravitational field. These families bear the names of their largest members. The identification of satellite families is tentative, but the following are typically listed:[4][60][61]\n\n\n\n* Prograde satellites:\n\t+ Themisto is the innermost irregular moon and is not part of a known family.[4][60]\n\t+ The Himalia group is confined within semi-major axes between 11–12 million km (6.8–7.5 million mi), inclinations between 27–29°, and eccentricities between 0.12 and 0.21.[62] It has been suggested that the group could be a remnant of the break-up of an asteroid from the asteroid belt.[60]\n\t+ The Carpo group includes two known moons on very high orbital inclinations of 50° and semi-major axes between 16–17 million km (9.9–10.6 million mi).[4] Due to their exceptionally high inclinations, the moons of the Carpo group are subject to gravitational perturbations that induce the Lidov–Kozai resonance in their orbits, which cause their eccentricities and inclinations to periodically oscillate in correspondence with each other.[35] The Lidov–Kozai resonance can significantly alter the orbits of these moons: for example, the eccentricity and inclination of the group's namesake Carpo can fluctuate between 0.19–0.69 and 44–59°, respectively.[35]\n\t+ Valetudo is the outermost prograde moon and is not part of a known family. Its prograde orbit crosses paths with several moons that have retrograde orbits and may in the future collide with them.[37]\n* Retrograde satellites:\n\t+ The Carme group is tightly confined within semi-major axes between 22–24 million km (14–15 million mi), inclinations between 164–166°, and eccentricities between 0.25 and 0.28.[62] It is very homogeneous in color (light red) and is believed to have originated as collisional fragments from a D-type asteroid progenitor, possibly a Jupiter trojan.[27]\n\t+ The Ananke group has a relatively wider spread than the previous groups, with semi-major axes between 19–22 million km (12–14 million mi), inclinations between 144–156°, and eccentricities between 0.09 and 0.25.[62] Most of the members appear gray, and are believed to have formed from the breakup of a captured asteroid.[27]\n\t+ The Pasiphae group is quite dispersed, with semi-major axes spread over 22–25 million km (14–16 million mi), inclinations between 141° and 157°, and higher eccentricities between 0.23 and 0.44.[62] The colors also vary significantly, from red to grey, which might be the result of multiple collisions. Sinope, sometimes included in the Pasiphae group,[27] is red and, given the difference in inclination, it could have been captured independently;[60] Pasiphae and Sinope are also trapped in secular resonances with Jupiter.[63]\n\n\nBased on their survey discoveries in 2000–2003, Sheppard and Jewitt predicted that Jupiter should have approximately 100 irregular satellites larger than 1 km (0.6 mi) in diameter, or brighter than magnitude 24.[27]: 262 Survey observations by Alexandersen et al. in 2010–2011 agreed with this prediction, estimating that approximately 40 Jovian irregular satellites of this size remained undiscovered in 2012.[31]: 4\n\n\nIn September 2020, researchers from the University of British Columbia identified 45 candidate irregular moons from an analysis of archival images taken in 2010 by the CFHT.[64] These candidates were mainly small and faint, down to magnitude of 25.7 or above 0.8 km (0.5 mi) in diameter. From the number of candidate moons detected within a sky area of one square degree, the team extrapolated that the population of retrograde Jovian moons brighter than magnitude 25.7 is around 600+600  \n−300 within a factor of 2.[5]: 6 Although the team considers their characterized candidates to be likely moons of Jupiter, they all remain unconfirmed due to insufficient observation data for determining reliable orbits.[64] The true population of Jovian irregular moons is likely complete down to magnitude 23.2 at diameters over 3 km (1.9 mi) as of 2020[update].[5]: 6[31]: 4\n\n\n\n## List[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Orbital diagram of the orbital inclination and orbital distances for Jupiter's rings and moon system at various scales. Notable moons, moon groups, and rings are individually labeled. Open the image for full resolution.\nThe moons of Jupiter are listed below by orbital period. Moons massive enough for their surfaces to have collapsed into a spheroid are highlighted in bold. These are the four Galilean moons, which are comparable in size to the Moon. The other moons are much smaller, with the least massive Galilean moon being more than 7,000 times more massive than the most massive of the other moons. The irregular captured moons are shaded light gray and orange when prograde and yellow, red, and dark gray when retrograde.\n\n\nThe orbits and mean distances of the irregular moons are highly variable over short timescales due to frequent planetary and solar perturbations,[35] so proper orbital elements which are averaged over a period of time are preferably used. The proper orbital elements of the irregular moons listed here are averaged over a 400-year numerical integration by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory: for the above reasons, they may strongly differ from osculating orbital elements provided by other sources.[62] Otherwise, recently-discovered irregular moons without published proper elements are temporarily listed here with inaccurate osculating orbital elements that are *italicized* to distinguish them from other irregular moons with proper orbital elements. Some of the irregular moons' proper orbital periods in this list may not scale accordingly with their proper semi-major axes due to the aforementioned perturbations. The irregular moons' proper orbital elements are all based on the reference epoch of 1 January 2000.[62]\n\n\nSome irregular moons have only been observed briefly for a year or two, but their orbits are known accurately enough that they will not be lost to positional uncertainties.[35][4] As of February 2023[update], only three known moons of Jupiter—S/2022 J 1, S/2022 J 2, and S/2022 J 3—have observation arcs shorter than one year and are therefore at risk of becoming lost.[4]\n\n\n\n| Key\n |\n| --- |\n|  Inner moons\n | ♠ Galilean moons | † Themisto group\n | ♣ Himalia group | § Carpo

(moon) § Observational history\n\n![](image)The orbit and motion of the Galilean moons around Jupiter, as captured by JunoCam aboard the *Juno* spacecraft.\n![](image)Ganymede taken by Juno during its 34th perijove.\nNine spacecraft have visited Jupiter. The first were *Pioneer 10* in 1973, and *Pioneer 11* a year later, taking low-resolution images of the four Galilean moons and returning data on their atmospheres and radiation belts.[72] The *Voyager 1* and *Voyager 2* probes visited Jupiter in 1979, discovering the volcanic activity on Io and the presence of water ice on the surface of Europa. *Ulysses* further studied Jupiter's magnetosphere in 1992 and then again in 2000.\n\n\nThe *Galileo* spacecraft was the first to enter orbit around Jupiter, arriving in 1995 and studying it until 2003. During this period, *Galileo* gathered a large amount of information about the Jovian system, making close approaches to all of the Galilean moons and finding evidence for thin atmospheres on three of them, as well as the possibility of liquid water beneath the surfaces of Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. It also discovered a magnetic field around Ganymede.\n\n\nThen the *Cassini* probe to Saturn flew by Jupiter in 2000 and collected data on interactions of the Galilean moons with Jupiter's extended atmosphere. The *New Horizons* spacecraft flew by Jupiter in 2007 and made improved measurements of its satellites' orbital parameters.\n\n\nIn 2016, the *Juno* spacecraft imaged the Galilean moons from above their orbital plane as it approached Jupiter orbit insertion, creating a time-lapse movie of their motion.[73] With a mission extension, *Juno* has since begun close flybys of the Galileans, flying by Ganymede in 2021 followed by Europa and Io in 2022. It is planned to fly by Io again in late 2023 and once more in 2024.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Jupiter's moons in fiction\n* Satellite system (astronomy)\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The most-recently announced moons of Jupiter are S/2022 J 1, S/2022 J 2, and S/2022 J 3, published in MPECs 2023-D44 to 2023-D46.[2] These add three more to the previous count of 92 from January 2023, bringing the total up to 95.[3]\n2. **^** For comparison, the area of a sphere with diameter 250 km is about the area of Senegal and comparable to the area of Belarus, Syria and Uruguay. The area of a sphere with a diameter of 5 km is about the area of Guernsey and somewhat more than the area of San Marino. (But note that these smaller moons are not spherical.)\n3. **^** Jupiter Mass of 1.8986 × 1027 kg / Mass of Galilean moons 3.93 × 1023 kg = 4,828\n4. **^** Label refers to the Roman numeral attributed to each moon in order of their naming.\n5. **^** Diameters with multiple entries such as \"60 × 40 × 34\" reflect that the body is not a perfect spheroid and that each of its dimensions has been measured well enough.\n6. **^** The only satellites with measured masses are Amalthea, Himalia, and the four Galilean moons. The masses of the inner satellites are estimated by assuming a density similar to Amalthea's (0.86 g/cm3), while the rest of the irregular satellites are estimated by assuming a spherical volume and a density of 1 g/cm3.\n7. **^** Periods with negative values are retrograde.\n8. **^** \"?\" refers to group assignments that are not considered sure yet.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** \"Planetary Satellite Discovery Circumstances\". *JPL Solar System Dynamics*.
