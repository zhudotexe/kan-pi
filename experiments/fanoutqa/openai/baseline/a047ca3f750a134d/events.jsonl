The I-Pace was announced in March 2018, European deliveries began in June 2018 and North American deliveries started in October 2018.\n\n\n\n\n## Development[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The production car is 12 mm narrower and 12 mm lower than the concept (pictured).\nThe Jaguar I-Pace was designed by Ian Callum.[1] The concept version of the car, described as a five-seater sports car, was unveiled by JLR at the 2016 Los Angeles Motor Show and shown on-road in London in March 2017.[2][3]\n\n\nThe I-Pace is built by contract manufacturer Magna Steyr in Graz, Austria,[4][5] and the production version of the I-Pace was revealed in Graz on 1 March 2018.[6]\n\n\nSome of the electric drive technology[*which?*] has come out of the Jaguar I-Type electric Formula E racing car programme,[7] and the concentric motors were developed by JLR engineer Dr. Alex Michaelides.[8]\n\n\n\n\n## Specifications[edit]\n\n\n* ![Side](image)\n\nSide\n* ![Rear](image)\n\nRear\n* ![Interior](image)\n\nInterior\n\n\nThe Jaguar I-Pace launched with a WLTP-rated range of 292 miles (470 km)[9] and an EPA-rated range of 234 miles (377 km). In December 2019, software enhancements were released to increase range to an EPA-rated range of 246 miles (396 km).[10][11] The car has a wade depth[*clarification needed*] of 500 mm (20 in).[12] The rear boot holds 656 litres (23 cu ft),[13] along with 28 litres (1 cu ft) of front boot space. The drag coefficient is 0.29.[1]\n\n\nThe car has all-wheel drive via two motors powered by a 90 kWh LG Chem[1] lithium-ion battery with a battery management system developed by JLR.[8] Each motor delivers 197 hp (147 kW) and 258 lb⋅ft (350 N⋅m) of torque, for a total power of 395 hp (295 kW) and total torque of 516 lb⋅ft (700 N⋅m).[1] The 0–62 mph (0–100 km/h) time is 4.8 seconds,[9] and the top speed is electronically limited to 124 mph (200 km/h).[14]\n\n\nThe battery contains 432 pouch cells.[15] It can charge from 0 to 80 per cent in 85 minutes using 50 kW DC charging, or 45 minutes using a 100 kW charger. Home charging with an AC wall box (7 kW) achieves the same state of charge in 10 hours.[14] As the I-Pace was initially released with a single-phase 7 kW AC charger, a one-hour charge, would add around 30 km (19 miles) of range.[16] Later 2021 models had 11 kW AC charging, at single-phase or three-phase, depending on market.\n\n\nThe car comes with a smartphone app which can locate the car, report on its locking, alarming, and charging status, and start its battery preconditioning and/or cabin heating/cooling.[17]\n\n\n\n## Awards[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jaguar Chief of Design Ian Callum holds 2019 European Car of the Year trophy for the Jaguar I-Pace\nThe I-Pace has won 62[18] international awards. In March 2019, it won the European Car of the Year award, the first Jaguar to win the award.[19] In April 2019, it became the 2019 World Car of the Year, and won Best Design and Best Green Car awards.[20]\n\n\n\n## Safety[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2018,[21] the European New Car Assessment Programme (NCAP) awarded the Jaguar I-Pace a 5-star safety rating.\n\n\n\nEuro NCAP test results  \n\nJaguar I-Pace (2018)[22] \n| Test\n | Points\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Overall:\n | ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image) |\n| Adult occupant:\n | 34.8\n | 91%\n |\n| Child occupant:\n | 40.0\n | 81%\n |\n| Pedestrian:\n | 35.3\n | 73%\n |\n| Safety assist:\n | 10.6\n | 81%\n |\n\n## Racing[edit]\n\n\n### Jaguar I-Pace eTrophy (Racecar)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Jaguar I-Pace eTrophy (racecar)\n\nThe Jaguar I-Pace has a race-prepped version called the I-Pace eTrophy, a development of the I-Pace by Jaguar Special Vehicle Operations.\n\n\n\n### Series[edit]\n\n\nIn September 2017,[23] Jaguar announced their single-make racing series for the I-Pace, called eTrophy, after the racecar of the same name.\n\n\nOn 24 August 2018,[24] the Jaguar I-Pace set a new EV lap record at Laguna Seca Racetrack in California.\n\n\n\n## Sales[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year | Europe[25] | United States[26] |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 2018 | 6,490 | 393\n |\n| 2019 | 12,232 | 2,594\n |\n| 2020 | 13,444 | 1,546\n |\n| 2021 | 8,079 | 1,409\n |\n| **Total** | **40,245** | **5,942** |\n\n\n## Partnership for autonomous ride service[edit]\n\n\nIn 2018, Waymo selected the Jaguar I-Pace for use in its autonomous ride-hailing service, placing an order for 20,000 vehicles.[27]\n\n\n\n## Wireless charging project[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2020, Jaguar announced its support for a wirelessly-charged taxi project in Oslo, Norway. Jaguar will give 25 I-Pace vehicles to taxi company Cabonline, which will use the vehicles to test the charging infrastructure on taxis in the Norwegian capital. Ralf Speth, Jaguar Land Rover's chief executive said \"The taxi industry is the ideal test bed for wireless charging, and indeed for high-mileage electric mobility across the board\"[*dubious – discuss*].[28]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** Davies, Chris (14 November 2016). \"Jaguar I-Pace Concept previews Model X rivaling EV for 2018\". *slashgear.com*.

The drag coefficient is 0.29.[1]\n\n\nThe car has all-wheel drive via two motors powered by a 90 kWh LG Chem[1] lithium-ion battery with a battery management system developed by JLR.[8] Each motor delivers 197 hp (147 kW) and 258 lb⋅ft (350 N⋅m) of torque, for a total power of 395 hp (295 kW) and total torque of 516 lb⋅ft (700 N⋅m).[1] The 0–62 mph (0–100 km/h) time is 4.8 seconds,[9] and the top speed is electronically limited to 124 mph (200 km/h).[14]\n\n\nThe battery contains 432 pouch cells.[15] It can charge from 0 to 80 per cent in 85 minutes using 50 kW DC charging, or 45 minutes using a 100 kW charger. Home charging with an AC wall box (7 kW) achieves the same state of charge in 10 hours.[14] As the I-Pace was initially released with a single-phase 7 kW AC charger, a one-hour charge, would add around 30 km (19 miles) of range.[16] Later 2021 models had 11 kW AC charging, at single-phase or three-phase, depending on market.\n\n\nThe car comes with a smartphone app which can locate the car, report on its locking, alarming, and charging status, and start its battery preconditioning and/or cabin heating/cooling.[17]\n\n\n\n## Awards[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jaguar Chief of Design Ian Callum holds 2019 European Car of the Year trophy for the Jaguar I-Pace\nThe I-Pace has won 62[18] international awards. In March 2019, it won the European Car of the Year award, the first Jaguar to win the award.[19] In April 2019, it became the 2019 World Car of the Year, and won Best Design and Best Green Car awards.[20]\n\n\n\n## Safety[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2018,[21] the European New Car Assessment Programme (NCAP) awarded the Jaguar I-Pace a 5-star safety rating.\n\n\n\nEuro NCAP test results  \n\nJaguar I-Pace (2018)[22] \n| Test\n | Points\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Overall:\n | ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image) |\n| Adult occupant:\n | 34.8\n | 91%\n |\n| Child occupant:\n | 40.0\n | 81%\n |\n| Pedestrian:\n | 35.3\n | 73%\n |\n| Safety assist:\n | 10.6\n | 81%\n |\n\n## Racing[edit]\n\n\n### Jaguar I-Pace eTrophy (Racecar)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Jaguar I-Pace eTrophy (racecar)\n\nThe Jaguar I-Pace has a race-prepped version called the I-Pace eTrophy, a development of the I-Pace by Jaguar Special Vehicle Operations.\n\n\n\n### Series[edit]\n\n\nIn September 2017,[23] Jaguar announced their single-make racing series for the I-Pace, called eTrophy, after the racecar of the same name.\n\n\nOn 24 August 2018,[24] the Jaguar I-Pace set a new EV lap record at Laguna Seca Racetrack in California.\n\n\n\n## Sales[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year | Europe[25] | United States[26] |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 2018 | 6,490 | 393\n |\n| 2019 | 12,232 | 2,594\n |\n| 2020 | 13,444 | 1,546\n |\n| 2021 | 8,079 | 1,409\n |\n| **Total** | **40,245** | **5,942** |\n\n\n## Partnership for autonomous ride service[edit]\n\n\nIn 2018, Waymo selected the Jaguar I-Pace for use in its autonomous ride-hailing service, placing an order for 20,000 vehicles.[27]\n\n\n\n## Wireless charging project[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2020, Jaguar announced its support for a wirelessly-charged taxi project in Oslo, Norway. Jaguar will give 25 I-Pace vehicles to taxi company Cabonline, which will use the vehicles to test the charging infrastructure on taxis in the Norwegian capital. Ralf Speth, Jaguar Land Rover's chief executive said \"The taxi industry is the ideal test bed for wireless charging, and indeed for high-mileage electric mobility across the board\"[*dubious – discuss*].[28]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** Davies, Chris (14 November 2016). \"Jaguar I-Pace Concept previews Model X rivaling EV for 2018\". *slashgear.com*.

Positioned above the smaller Sorento, the Telluride was previewed as a concept car in 2016, with the production model debuting in the spring of 2019 as a 2020 model. It shares components and specifications with its sister model, the Hyundai Palisade, including its engine, transmission, and wheelbase.[5] Named after the town of Telluride, Colorado, the Telluride is the largest vehicle Kia has manufactured in the United States.[6]\n\n\nIn 2020, the Telluride was named the 2020 World Car of the Year as well as *Motor Trend*'s SUV of the year.[7]\n\n\n\n\n## Overview[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rear view\nThe production version of the Telluride was launched at the 2019 North American International Auto Show in January. Previously, the Telluride was displayed as a customized version inspired by fashion designer Brandon Maxwell's Texas-inspired collection, at New York Fashion Week in September 2018.[8] The overall design is similar to the 2016 concept except for the front end which was completely redesigned.\n\n\nThe Telluride is the first Kia designed specifically for the US market, with the design work handled at the Kia Design Center in Irvine, California.[9] The production version Telluride is powered by a 3.8-liter *Lambda II* V6 Atkinson cycle gasoline engine rated at 291 hp (295 PS; 217 kW) and 355 N⋅m (36.2 kg⋅m; 262 lb⋅ft), paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission and either front-wheel drive or all-wheel-drive.\n\n\nThe Telluride features four drive modes – Smart, Eco, Sport and Comfort. Snow and AWD Lock modes are also available for specific driving conditions, and the on-demand electro-hydraulic AWD system with multi-plate clutch plate constantly redistributes power to both axles. In Eco and Smart modes, power is completely routed to the front wheels, whereas Sport mode splits the power down to 65 percent front, 35 percent rear.[10]\n\n\nThe standard towing rate for this SUV is rated at 5,000 pounds (2,300 kg), and it also features the optional self-levelling rear suspension where the ride height is automatically calibrated depending on vehicle load to optimise control and stability.[10]\n\n\nThe Telluride is not marketed in South Korea as it is only produced in the United States, whereas its Hyundai counterpart, the Korean-built Palisade is marketed there instead.[11] Exports from the West Point, Georgia plant to the Middle East started in February 2019.[12] Kia limited exports of the Telluride to around 3,000 units annually.[13] This is mainly due to the fact that non-Korean made vehicles are subjected to high tariffs, and is also not marketed in Australia due to the law stating that only RHD vehicles can be driven on public roads.\n\n\n\n## Trim levels[edit]\n\n\nIn U.S. and Canada, the Telluride is offered in four trim levels: LX, S, EX, and SX.[14] The latter is offered with an optional \"SX Prestige Package,\" which include several premium features.[15] Since 2021, Kia has offered a \"Premium Package\" on the EX trim. A 3-seat bench is standard for the second row while captain's chairs can be added, dropping the seating capacity from eight to seven.[9]\n\n\nAll Tellurides are equipped with various features that are otherwise optional in some of its competitors, such as \"Sofino\" (leatherette)-trimmed or leather-trimmed seating surfaces. Available equipment includes a 10.25-inch touchscreen infotainment system, rear view monitor, 630-watt 10-speaker Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone charging tray, and head-up display with turn-by-turn navigation, along with heated and ventilated first and second row bucket seats. The Telluride is also equipped with Driver Talk for some trim levels, an in-car intercom system that allows the driver to communicate separately with passengers in the second or third row.[10]\n\n\n\n\n## 2023 refresh[edit]\n\n\nThe refreshed 2023 Telluride was unveiled at the New York International Auto Show on April 13, 2022.[16] New convenience technology such as a 12.3-inch instrument panel and an available smart power liftgate with auto-close functionality were added. On the exterior, the grille, headlights, and front bumper were redesigned. More rugged-looking X-Line and X-Pro trims became available since the 2023 model year.[17]\n\n* ![2023 Kia Telluride](image)\n\n2023 Kia Telluride\n* ![Rear view](image)\n\nRear view\n* ![Interior](image)\n\nInterior\n\n\n## Concept version[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kia Telluride Concept\nThe concept version was first introduced at the 2016 North American International Auto Show. A mid-size, three-row, seven-passenger SUV, the Telluride concept is based on a modified Sorento chassis, and powered by a transversely-mounted 3.5-liter gasoline direct injected V6 producing 270 hp (201 kW) combined with an electric motor producing 130 hp (97 kW), for an overall output of 400 hp (298 kW). Fuel consumption is claimed to be 30 miles per US gallon (7.8 L/100 km).[18]\n\n\nThe exterior was finished in *dark pyrite* paint and featured a squared off body riding on 22-inch rims, as well as an enlarged tiger nose grille and multiple LED headlamps, consistent with Kia's current design language (as of 2016).[19] The car's suicide doors swung open 90 degrees in opposite directions,[20] revealing a pillarless design.[21] Some of the interior components were 3D printed, marking Kia's first usage of 3D printing technology.[22] It was designed by Tom Kearns from Kia Design Center America.[23]\n\n\n\n\n## Sales[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | U.S.[24] |\n| --- | --- |\n| 2019\n | 58,604\n |\n| 2020\n | 75,129\n |\n| 2021\n | 93,705\n |\n| 2022\n | 99,891\n |\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"First 2020 Kia Telluride Rolls Off The Production Line\". *CarBuzz*.

Positioned above the smaller Sorento, the Telluride was previewed as a concept car in 2016, with the production model debuting in the spring of 2019 as a 2020 model. It shares components and specifications with its sister model, the Hyundai Palisade, including its engine, transmission, and wheelbase.[5] Named after the town of Telluride, Colorado, the Telluride is the largest vehicle Kia has manufactured in the United States.[6]\n\n\nIn 2020, the Telluride was named the 2020 World Car of the Year as well as *Motor Trend*'s SUV of the year.[7]\n\n\n\n\n## Overview[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rear view\nThe production version of the Telluride was launched at the 2019 North American International Auto Show in January. Previously, the Telluride was displayed as a customized version inspired by fashion designer Brandon Maxwell's Texas-inspired collection, at New York Fashion Week in September 2018.[8] The overall design is similar to the 2016 concept except for the front end which was completely redesigned.\n\n\nThe Telluride is the first Kia designed specifically for the US market, with the design work handled at the Kia Design Center in Irvine, California.[9] The production version Telluride is powered by a 3.8-liter *Lambda II* V6 Atkinson cycle gasoline engine rated at 291 hp (295 PS; 217 kW) and 355 N⋅m (36.2 kg⋅m; 262 lb⋅ft), paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission and either front-wheel drive or all-wheel-drive.\n\n\nThe Telluride features four drive modes – Smart, Eco, Sport and Comfort. Snow and AWD Lock modes are also available for specific driving conditions, and the on-demand electro-hydraulic AWD system with multi-plate clutch plate constantly redistributes power to both axles. In Eco and Smart modes, power is completely routed to the front wheels, whereas Sport mode splits the power down to 65 percent front, 35 percent rear.[10]\n\n\nThe standard towing rate for this SUV is rated at 5,000 pounds (2,300 kg), and it also features the optional self-levelling rear suspension where the ride height is automatically calibrated depending on vehicle load to optimise control and stability.[10]\n\n\nThe Telluride is not marketed in South Korea as it is only produced in the United States, whereas its Hyundai counterpart, the Korean-built Palisade is marketed there instead.[11] Exports from the West Point, Georgia plant to the Middle East started in February 2019.[12] Kia limited exports of the Telluride to around 3,000 units annually.[13] This is mainly due to the fact that non-Korean made vehicles are subjected to high tariffs, and is also not marketed in Australia due to the law stating that only RHD vehicles can be driven on public roads.\n\n\n\n## Trim levels[edit]\n\n\nIn U.S. and Canada, the Telluride is offered in four trim levels: LX, S, EX, and SX.[14] The latter is offered with an optional \"SX Prestige Package,\" which include several premium features.[15] Since 2021, Kia has offered a \"Premium Package\" on the EX trim. A 3-seat bench is standard for the second row while captain's chairs can be added, dropping the seating capacity from eight to seven.[9]\n\n\nAll Tellurides are equipped with various features that are otherwise optional in some of its competitors, such as \"Sofino\" (leatherette)-trimmed or leather-trimmed seating surfaces. Available equipment includes a 10.25-inch touchscreen infotainment system, rear view monitor, 630-watt 10-speaker Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone charging tray, and head-up display with turn-by-turn navigation, along with heated and ventilated first and second row bucket seats. The Telluride is also equipped with Driver Talk for some trim levels, an in-car intercom system that allows the driver to communicate separately with passengers in the second or third row.[10]\n\n\n\n\n## 2023 refresh[edit]\n\n\nThe refreshed 2023 Telluride was unveiled at the New York International Auto Show on April 13, 2022.[16] New convenience technology such as a 12.3-inch instrument panel and an available smart power liftgate with auto-close functionality were added. On the exterior, the grille, headlights, and front bumper were redesigned. More rugged-looking X-Line and X-Pro trims became available since the 2023 model year.[17]\n\n* ![2023 Kia Telluride](image)\n\n2023 Kia Telluride\n* ![Rear view](image)\n\nRear view\n* ![Interior](image)\n\nInterior\n\n\n## Concept version[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kia Telluride Concept\nThe concept version was first introduced at the 2016 North American International Auto Show. A mid-size, three-row, seven-passenger SUV, the Telluride concept is based on a modified Sorento chassis, and powered by a transversely-mounted 3.5-liter gasoline direct injected V6 producing 270 hp (201 kW) combined with an electric motor producing 130 hp (97 kW), for an overall output of 400 hp (298 kW). Fuel consumption is claimed to be 30 miles per US gallon (7.8 L/100 km).[18]\n\n\nThe exterior was finished in *dark pyrite* paint and featured a squared off body riding on 22-inch rims, as well as an enlarged tiger nose grille and multiple LED headlamps, consistent with Kia's current design language (as of 2016).[19] The car's suicide doors swung open 90 degrees in opposite directions,[20] revealing a pillarless design.[21] Some of the interior components were 3D printed, marking Kia's first usage of 3D printing technology.[22] It was designed by Tom Kearns from Kia Design Center America.[23]\n\n\n\n\n## Sales[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | U.S.[24] |\n| --- | --- |\n| 2019\n | 58,604\n |\n| 2020\n | 75,129\n |\n| 2021\n | 93,705\n |\n| 2022\n | 99,891\n |\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"First 2020 Kia Telluride Rolls Off The Production Line\". *CarBuzz*.

Based on the MEB platform, the ID.4 is the second model of the Volkswagen ID. series. The production version of the ID.4 debuted in September 2020 as the first fully-electric crossover SUV under the Volkswagen brand,[7] while the coupe-shaped variant of the ID.4 (akin to the Audi Q8 Sportback e-tron) is marketed as the Volkswagen ID.5 and was revealed in November 2021.[8]\n\n\nThe ID.4 is positioned by Volkswagen as a high-volume, mass-market electric vehicle — a car for \"the millions, not the millionaires,\" as the company claimed in its advertising.[9] It was delivered to European customers from late 2020, and the first quarter of 2021 for the North American market.[10][11]\n\n\nThe ID.4 was elected World Car of the Year 2021 over runner-ups Honda e and Toyota Yaris.[12]\n\n\n2024 Volkswagen ID.4, ID.5 electric SUV gets upgrades.[13]\n\n\n\n\n## Overview[edit]\n\n\nThe ID.4 was previewed the I.D. Crozz and I.D. Crozz II concept cars, which debuted in 2017 at the Shanghai and Frankfurt Auto Show, respectively.[14] A prototype version of the ID.4 appeared in camouflage at the 2019 Frankfurt Motor Show discreetly so as not to steal the show from the first electric mass-market vehicle of the German brand, the ID.3.[15]\n\n\nThe production version was unveiled globally on 23 September 2020. Unlike the ID.3 which is oriented mainly for the European market, the ID.4 also targeted the North American region as one of its core markets. Volkswagen Group of America CEO Scott Keogh went as far as saying the ID.4 \"drives like a GTI, it has the packaging of a Tiguan and the purpose of the Beetle,\" to emphasize its driving dynamics, design, and technology.[16]\n\n\nAt launch, the electric SUV was solely offered with rear-wheel-drive and an electric motor located at the rear axle, with the dual motor all-wheel-drive version following later. First sales were for the ID.4 \"1st edition\", which differs in some interior and exterior features from the series production models.[17]\n\n\nHeadlights and taillights are mostly LED lamps on the ID.4, with Matrix LED lights being an optional feature in some regions. The front features a low-positioned air inlet behind which the radiator and parts of the air conditioning system are located. Short overhangs and a wheelbase of 2,766 mm (108.9 in) add up to a length of 4,584 mm (180.5 in). Wheels are offered in 18–21 inch sizes. RWD models can tow a maximum of 1,000 kg (2,200 lb) braked with an optional tow bar and fits roof rails as standard.[18]\n\n\nApple Carplay and Android Auto are offered as standard, in addition to an optional augmented reality head-up display (HUD). In addition to the 5.3 inch driver display, the ID.4 features a 10-inch infotainment screen, though an optional 12 inch screen is available. By default, the vehicle includes a light strip below the windscreen providing visual cues related to certain functions such as the state of charge (SOC) when charging or brake alerts, which VW calls \"ID. Light\".\n\n\nSafety features include VW's Car2X communication system.\n\n\nAn optional heat pump extending range under low temperature conditions is offered or even fitted as standard in certain markets such as Canada[19] and uses a R744 (CO2) refrigerant.[20] It is claimed to heat the cabin 2-3 times more efficiently than a resistance heater.\n\n\nThe boot offers 848 L of volume and 1,817 L when the rear seats are folded. The vehicle does not offer a storage compartment at the front end (\"frunk\"). The ID. 4 will be launched in Australasia alongside with ID.3, ID.5 and ID. Buzz in Mid-2024 [21]\n\n\n\n* ![Rear view](image)\n\nRear view\n* ![Interior](image)\n\nInterior\n\n\n### Volkswagen ID.5[edit]\n\n\nThe Volkswagen ID.5 was previewed in August 2021, revealed in November 2021, and produced since January 2022.[8][22] It features a lower 0.26 drag coefficient, which is 0.02 lower than the ID.4. The model is available in three variants, which are Pro, Pro Performance and GTX, with the latter using a dual motor all-wheel-drive layout. Three powertrain options are available, although unlike the ID.4, the ID.5 comes with just one battery capacity, which is 77 kWh. The ID.5's sloping roofline decreases the cargo space, which offers 549 L with the rear seats up and 1,561 L with the seats folded.[23]\n\n* ![Volkswagen ID.5 GTX](image)\n\nVolkswagen ID.5 GTX\n* ![Rear view](image)\n\nRear view\n\n\n\n## Specifications[edit]\n\n\n### Powertrain[edit]\n\n\nThe ID.4 is fitted with the APP 550 drive of the underlying MEB platform, which consists of an oil-cooled brushless permanently excited synchronous machine positioned at the rear axle. The motor produces between 210 kW (286 PS; 282 hp) of power and up to 550 N⋅m (410 lb⋅ft) of torque,[24] revolving at speeds of up to 16,000 rpm.[18]\n\n\nThe ID.4 recuperates energy when braking using the service brake pedal, with up to 0.25 g. When driving with the gear selector set to “D” mode, if the driver lifts their foot off the accelerator pedal, the vehicle is set to coast along in order to preserve energy, with the motor freely rotating. However the vehicle can also be set to “B” mode where it will recuperate instead, again with forces of up to 0.25 g. When stronger deceleration is required, the vehicle uses electrically boosted conventional hydraulic brakes.\n\n\n\n### Battery[edit]\n\n\nThe battery consists of a lithium-Ion battery pack which houses 9 battery modules in 10 compartments (Pure) or 12 modules (Pro) containing the individual battery cells (24 per module) in a rectangular aluminium casing which sits in the vehicle's underbody. While the smaller battery holds an energy content of 55 kWh, of which 52 kWh are made available to the user, the larger pack comes in at 82/77 kWh. A model with a 62 kWh gross, 58 kWh net battery pack was released for the North American market in 2022.\n\n\nThe battery's thermal management system is designed to maintain the battery's temperature around the ideal range of 25 °C (77 °F) and utilises liquid cooling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Battery Capacityfull/usable [kWh]\n | 55 / 52\n | 62 / 58\n | 82 / 77\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Drivetrain** | RWD\n | AWD\n |\n| Model Name\n | ID.4 Pure\n | ID.4 Pure Performance\n | ID.4\nStandard\n | ID.5 Pro\n | ID.4 Pro / Pro Performance\n | ID.5 Pro Performance\n | ID.4 AWD / GTX\n | ID.5 GTX\n |\n| Availability\n | From spring 2021[25] | From spring 2021[25] | From summer 2022\n | From winter 2022\n | From spring 2021[25] | From spring 2022\n | From summer 2021\n | From winter 2022\n |\n| Range (EPA)\n | —\n | —\n | 209 miles (336 km)\n | —\n | 275 mi (443 km)\n | —\n | 255 mi (410 km)\n | —\n |\n| Range (WLTP)\n | 361 km (224 mi)\n | 361 km (224 mi)\n | —\n | 534 km (332 mi)\n | 531 km (330 mi)\n | 534 km (332 mi)\n | 500 km (310 mi)\n | 512 km (318 mi)\n |\n| Acceleration0–60 mph (0–97 km/h)\n | —\n | —\n | 7.1s\n | —\n | 7.7 s\n | —\n | 5.7 s[26] | —\n |\n| Acceleration0–100 km/h (0–62 mph)\n | 10.9 s\n | 9 s\n | —\n | 10.4 s\n | 8.5 s\n | 8.4 s\n | 6.2 s[27] | 6.3 s\n |\n| Power Output\n[kW]\n | 109 kW (146 hp; 148 PS)\n | 125 kW (168 hp; 170 PS)\n | 150 kW (201 hp; 204 PS)\n | 128 kW (172 hp; 174 PS)\n | 150 kW (201 hp; 204 PS)\n | 220 kW (295 hp; 299 PS)\n |\n| Peak Torque\n[N⋅m]\n | 220 N⋅m (162 lb⋅ft)\n | 310 N⋅m (229 lb⋅ft)\n | 310 N⋅m (229 lb⋅ft)\n | 235 N⋅m (173 lb⋅ft)\n | 310 N⋅m (229 lb⋅ft)\n | 460 N⋅m (339 lb⋅ft)\n |\n| Top Speed[km/h]\n | 160 km/h (99 mph)\n | 180 km/h (112 mph)\n |\n| Kerb Weight [kg]\n | 1,891 kg (4,169 lb)\n | 1,958 kg (4,317 lb)\n | 2,117 kg (4,667 lb)\n | 2,049 kg (4,517 lb)\n | 2,118 kg (4,669 lb)\n | 2,224 kg (4,903 lb)\n | 2,243 kg (4,945 lb)\n |\n| Peak DC Fast Charge (DCFC) Power\n[kW]\n | Up to 110 kW, 50 kW standard\n | 140 kW\n | 135 kW on LG Energy Solution provided batteries; up to 170 kW on SK On provided batteries [28] 125 kW on previous models (can be increased to 135 kW via a software update)\n |\n| Peak AC Charging Power\n[kW]\n | 7.2 kW\n | 11 kW\n |\n| Charging time[29] | 100%: 450 minutes (AC single-phase wallbox/charging station 7.2 kW); 80%: 53 minutes (DC charging station 50.0 kW), 38 minutes (DC charging station 100.0 kW)\n | 100%: 450 minutes (AC single-phase wallbox/charging station 7.2 kW); 80%: 53 minutes (DC charging station 50.0 kW), 38 minutes (DC charging station 100.0 kW)\n | 100%: 450 minutes (AC 3-phase wallbox/charging station 11.0 kW); 80%: 38 minutes (DC charging station 125.0 kW)\n | 100%: 450 minutes (AC 3-phase wallbox/charging station 11.0 kW); 80%: 29 minutes (DC charging station 135.0 kW)\n | 100%: 450 minutes (AC 3-phase wallbox/charging station 11.0 kW); 80%: 38 minutes (DC charging station 125.0 kW)\n | 100%: 450 minutes (AC 3-phase wallbox/charging station 11.0 kW); 80%: 38 minutes (DC charging station 125.0 kW)\n | 100%: 450 minutes (AC 3-phase wallbox/charging station 11.0 kW); 80%: 36 minutes (DC charging station 135.0 kW)\n | 100%: 450 minutes (AC 3-phase wallbox/charging station 11.0 kW); 80%: 36 minutes (DC charging station 135.0 kW)\n |\n\n\n## Markets[edit]\n\n\n### Europe[edit]\n\n\nFor the European market, the ID.4 is available with four electric motor options. The versions with 146 hp (148 PS; 109 kW) or 168 hp (170 PS; 125 kW) are powered by a 52 kWh battery pack, while the larger 77 kWh battery can be paired with either a 172 hp (174 PS; 128 kW) or a 201 hp (204 PS; 150 kW) motor and has a WLTP range of \"up to\" 323 mi (520 km) on a single charge.[30] The range-topping model is capable of a 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) sprint in 8.5 seconds.[31][32]\n\n\nAn AWD variant of the ID.4, marketed as the **ID.4 GTX** in Europe,[27] accelerates 0–96 km/h (0–60 mph) in 5.7 seconds[26] and 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) in 6.2 seconds.[27]\n\n\nThe ID.4 is produced at the Volkswagen Zwickau-Mosel Plant in Germany since start of production and is also built at the company's Emden plant since May 2022.[33]\n[34]\n\n\n\n* ![Volkswagen ID.4 GTX](image)\n\nVolkswagen ID.4 GTX\n* ![Volkswagen ID.4 GTX](image)\n\nVolkswagen ID.4 GTX\n* ![Interior](image)\n\nInterior\n\n\n### North America[edit]\n\n\nFor the North American market, the available configurations are a RWD configuration that produces 201 horsepower (150 kW) and 229 pound-feet (310 N⋅m) of torque or an AWD configuration that produces 295 horsepower (220 kW) and 339 pound-feet (460 N⋅m) of torque. It is powered by a 62 kWh or 82 kWh battery pack (gross capacity) positioned in the underbody. The 82 kWh battery pack offers a range of 245–280 mi (394–451 km) on a full charge on the EPA cycle, depending on version.[35] The 62 kWh battery pack is rated at 209 miles (336 km) by the EPA.[36]\n\n\n2021-2022 models were imported to North America and built in the Volkswagen Zwickau-Mosel Plant or Emden plant since model year 2022.[34]\n\n\nIn August 2022, Volkswagen announced production location changes and added features for 2023 model year ID.4s, the Volkswagen ID.4 sold in North America will be made in Volkswagen's Chattanooga Tennessee Assembly Plant.\nChattanooga began producing the ID.4 on July 26, 2022.[37]\n\n\nThe North American ID.4 got a moderate refresh for model year 2023. It introduced a new 62 kWh battery pack that is now on the new Standard and S trim levels. The 62 kWh (gross) battery pack is provided exclusively by SK On and has a peak charging rate of 140 kW.\nThe Standard trim level reduced the base price of the ID.4 to $37,495 (up to $38,995 since December 2022). \nThe larger 82 kWh (gross) battery pack got updated and since December 2022, it is split between two battery suppliers to increase production output, SK On and LG Energy Solution. On 82 kWh *RWD* models, some vehicles get the SK On battery pack providing a 170 kW peak charging speed, while other vehicles get the LG Energy Solutions battery pack with a 135 kW peak charging speed as used in most pre-2023 model year vehicles. All 82 kWh *AWD* models get the SK On battery with the 170 kW peak charging. Volkswagen quotes a 10-80% DC fast charging time of 30 minutes for the SK On battery pack and 36 minutes for the LG battery pack. The battery capacity and EPA rated range are identical between the two battery packs.[38]\n\n\nThe 2023 refresh also includes a redesigned center console, a larger 12-inch Discover Pro Max infotainment system, Park Assist Plus (autonomous parking system), assisted lane changing to the semi-autonomous highway assist system branded Volkswagen Travel Assist (Travel Assist is standard on every North American ID.4, however, 2021-22 models do not have the assisted lane change function) and 45-watt USB-C fast device charging standard across all trims. As well as new options like Area View (surround view camera system), three-zone automatic climate control, heated rear seats, and new paint colors.[39]\n\n\n\n### China[edit]\n\n\nThe Volkswagen ID.4 is available as two variants in China called the ID.4 X and the ID.4 Crozz. The two variants feature slightly different styling and are produced by SAIC-Volkswagen and FAW-Volkswagen respectively.[40]\n\n\n\nThe ID.4 Crozz is similar to the European ID.4 and is offered with a smaller battery and a range of 400 km (249 mi) and 125 kW (168 hp; 170 PS) of power as well as a longer-ranged version offering 550 km (342 mi) of range according to the NEDC test and 150 kW (201 hp; 204 PS) of power. A high performance version with dual motor all-wheel drive and 225 kW (302 hp; 306 PS) as well as 520 km (323 mi) of range is to be released as well.[41] For the SAIC-Volkswagen ID.4 X, the car gains 20 mm (0.8 in) in length, mainly through the addition of a different bumper.[42]\n\n* ![Volkswagen ID.4 X (China)](image)\n\nVolkswagen ID.4 X (China)\n* ![Volkswagen ID.4 X (China)](image)\n\nVolkswagen ID.4 X (China)\n* ![Volkswagen ID.4 Crozz (China)](image)\n\nVolkswagen ID.4 Crozz (China)\n* ![Volkswagen ID.4 Crozz (China)](image)\n\nVolkswagen ID.4 Crozz (China)\n* ![Volkswagen ID.4 Crozz interior](image)\n\nVolkswagen ID.4 Crozz interior\n* ![Volkswagen ID.4 Crozz and ID.4 X side by side](image)\n\nVolkswagen ID.4 Crozz and ID.4 X side by side\n\n\n## Sales and marketing[edit]\n\n\n\n\nID.4 sales\n| Year\n | Europe[43] | US\n | China\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ID.4 X[44] | ID.4 Crozz[45] |\n| 2020\n | 4,810\n |  |  |  |\n| 2021\n | 53,605\n | 16,742[46] | 23,174\n | 26,853\n |\n| 2022\n | 67,655\n | 20,511[47] | 33,761\n | 34,273\n |\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the 2023 French animated film *Ladybug & Cat Noir: The Movie*, Cat Noir drives an ID.4, following a deal between Volkswagen and French company ZAG Inc.[48]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Volkswagen ID.3\n* Volkswagen ID.

Based on the MEB platform, the ID.4 is the second model of the Volkswagen ID. series. The production version of the ID.4 debuted in September 2020 as the first fully-electric crossover SUV under the Volkswagen brand,[7] while the coupe-shaped variant of the ID.4 (akin to the Audi Q8 Sportback e-tron) is marketed as the Volkswagen ID.5 and was revealed in November 2021.[8]\n\n\nThe ID.4 is positioned by Volkswagen as a high-volume, mass-market electric vehicle — a car for \"the millions, not the millionaires,\" as the company claimed in its advertising.[9] It was delivered to European customers from late 2020, and the first quarter of 2021 for the North American market.[10][11]\n\n\nThe ID.4 was elected World Car of the Year 2021 over runner-ups Honda e and Toyota Yaris.[12]\n\n\n2024 Volkswagen ID.4, ID.5 electric SUV gets upgrades.[13]\n\n\n\n\n## Overview[edit]\n\n\nThe ID.4 was previewed the I.D. Crozz and I.D. Crozz II concept cars, which debuted in 2017 at the Shanghai and Frankfurt Auto Show, respectively.[14] A prototype version of the ID.4 appeared in camouflage at the 2019 Frankfurt Motor Show discreetly so as not to steal the show from the first electric mass-market vehicle of the German brand, the ID.3.[15]\n\n\nThe production version was unveiled globally on 23 September 2020. Unlike the ID.3 which is oriented mainly for the European market, the ID.4 also targeted the North American region as one of its core markets. Volkswagen Group of America CEO Scott Keogh went as far as saying the ID.4 \"drives like a GTI, it has the packaging of a Tiguan and the purpose of the Beetle,\" to emphasize its driving dynamics, design, and technology.[16]\n\n\nAt launch, the electric SUV was solely offered with rear-wheel-drive and an electric motor located at the rear axle, with the dual motor all-wheel-drive version following later. First sales were for the ID.4 \"1st edition\", which differs in some interior and exterior features from the series production models.[17]\n\n\nHeadlights and taillights are mostly LED lamps on the ID.4, with Matrix LED lights being an optional feature in some regions. The front features a low-positioned air inlet behind which the radiator and parts of the air conditioning system are located. Short overhangs and a wheelbase of 2,766 mm (108.9 in) add up to a length of 4,584 mm (180.5 in). Wheels are offered in 18–21 inch sizes. RWD models can tow a maximum of 1,000 kg (2,200 lb) braked with an optional tow bar and fits roof rails as standard.[18]\n\n\nApple Carplay and Android Auto are offered as standard, in addition to an optional augmented reality head-up display (HUD). In addition to the 5.3 inch driver display, the ID.4 features a 10-inch infotainment screen, though an optional 12 inch screen is available. By default, the vehicle includes a light strip below the windscreen providing visual cues related to certain functions such as the state of charge (SOC) when charging or brake alerts, which VW calls \"ID. Light\".\n\n\nSafety features include VW's Car2X communication system.\n\n\nAn optional heat pump extending range under low temperature conditions is offered or even fitted as standard in certain markets such as Canada[19] and uses a R744 (CO2) refrigerant.[20] It is claimed to heat the cabin 2-3 times more efficiently than a resistance heater.\n\n\nThe boot offers 848 L of volume and 1,817 L when the rear seats are folded. The vehicle does not offer a storage compartment at the front end (\"frunk\"). The ID. 4 will be launched in Australasia alongside with ID.3, ID.5 and ID. Buzz in Mid-2024 [21]\n\n\n\n* ![Rear view](image)\n\nRear view\n* ![Interior](image)\n\nInterior\n\n\n### Volkswagen ID.5[edit]\n\n\nThe Volkswagen ID.5 was previewed in August 2021, revealed in November 2021, and produced since January 2022.[8][22] It features a lower 0.26 drag coefficient, which is 0.02 lower than the ID.4. The model is available in three variants, which are Pro, Pro Performance and GTX, with the latter using a dual motor all-wheel-drive layout. Three powertrain options are available, although unlike the ID.4, the ID.5 comes with just one battery capacity, which is 77 kWh. The ID.5's sloping roofline decreases the cargo space, which offers 549 L with the rear seats up and 1,561 L with the seats folded.[23]\n\n* ![Volkswagen ID.5 GTX](image)\n\nVolkswagen ID.5 GTX\n* ![Rear view](image)\n\nRear view\n\n\n\n## Specifications[edit]\n\n\n### Powertrain[edit]\n\n\nThe ID.4 is fitted with the APP 550 drive of the underlying MEB platform, which consists of an oil-cooled brushless permanently excited synchronous machine positioned at the rear axle. The motor produces between 210 kW (286 PS; 282 hp) of power and up to 550 N⋅m (410 lb⋅ft) of torque,[24] revolving at speeds of up to 16,000 rpm.[18]\n\n\nThe ID.4 recuperates energy when braking using the service brake pedal, with up to 0.25 g. When driving with the gear selector set to “D” mode, if the driver lifts their foot off the accelerator pedal, the vehicle is set to coast along in order to preserve energy, with the motor freely rotating. However the vehicle can also be set to “B” mode where it will recuperate instead, again with forces of up to 0.25 g. When stronger deceleration is required, the vehicle uses electrically boosted conventional hydraulic brakes.\n\n\n\n### Battery[edit]\n\n\nThe battery consists of a lithium-Ion battery pack which houses 9 battery modules in 10 compartments (Pure) or 12 modules (Pro) containing the individual battery cells (24 per module) in a rectangular aluminium casing which sits in the vehicle's underbody. While the smaller battery holds an energy content of 55 kWh, of which 52 kWh are made available to the user, the larger pack comes in at 82/77 kWh. A model with a 62 kWh gross, 58 kWh net battery pack was released for the North American market in 2022.\n\n\nThe battery's thermal management system is designed to maintain the battery's temperature around the ideal range of 25 °C (77 °F) and utilises liquid cooling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Battery Capacityfull/usable [kWh]\n | 55 / 52\n | 62 / 58\n | 82 / 77\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Drivetrain** | RWD\n | AWD\n |\n| Model Name\n | ID.4 Pure\n | ID.4 Pure Performance\n | ID.4\nStandard\n | ID.5 Pro\n | ID.4 Pro / Pro Performance\n | ID.5 Pro Performance\n | ID.4 AWD / GTX\n | ID.5 GTX\n |\n| Availability\n | From spring 2021[25] | From spring 2021[25] | From summer 2022\n | From winter 2022\n | From spring 2021[25] | From spring 2022\n | From summer 2021\n | From winter 2022\n |\n| Range (EPA)\n | —\n | —\n | 209 miles (336 km)\n | —\n | 275 mi (443 km)\n | —\n | 255 mi (410 km)\n | —\n |\n| Range (WLTP)\n | 361 km (224 mi)\n | 361 km (224 mi)\n | —\n | 534 km (332 mi)\n | 531 km (330 mi)\n | 534 km (332 mi)\n | 500 km (310 mi)\n | 512 km (318 mi)\n |\n| Acceleration0–60 mph (0–97 km/h)\n | —\n | —\n | 7.1s\n | —\n | 7.7 s\n | —\n | 5.7 s[26] | —\n |\n| Acceleration0–100 km/h (0–62 mph)\n | 10.9 s\n | 9 s\n | —\n | 10.4 s\n | 8.5 s\n | 8.4 s\n | 6.2 s[27] | 6.3 s\n |\n| Power Output\n[kW]\n | 109 kW (146 hp; 148 PS)\n | 125 kW (168 hp; 170 PS)\n | 150 kW (201 hp; 204 PS)\n | 128 kW (172 hp; 174 PS)\n | 150 kW (201 hp; 204 PS)\n | 220 kW (295 hp; 299 PS)\n |\n| Peak Torque\n[N⋅m]\n | 220 N⋅m (162 lb⋅ft)\n | 310 N⋅m (229 lb⋅ft)\n | 310 N⋅m (229 lb⋅ft)\n | 235 N⋅m (173 lb⋅ft)\n | 310 N⋅m (229 lb⋅ft)\n | 460 N⋅m (339 lb⋅ft)\n |\n| Top Speed[km/h]\n | 160 km/h (99 mph)\n | 180 km/h (112 mph)\n |\n| Kerb Weight [kg]\n | 1,891 kg (4,169 lb)\n | 1,958 kg (4,317 lb)\n | 2,117 kg (4,667 lb)\n | 2,049 kg (4,517 lb)\n | 2,118 kg (4,669 lb)\n | 2,224 kg (4,903 lb)\n | 2,243 kg (4,945 lb)\n |\n| Peak DC Fast Charge (DCFC) Power\n[kW]\n | Up to 110 kW, 50 kW standard\n | 140 kW\n | 135 kW on LG Energy Solution provided batteries; up to 170 kW on SK On provided batteries [28] 125 kW on previous models (can be increased to 135 kW via a software update)\n |\n| Peak AC Charging Power\n[kW]\n | 7.2 kW\n | 11 kW\n |\n| Charging time[29] | 100%: 450 minutes (AC single-phase wallbox/charging station 7.2 kW); 80%: 53 minutes (DC charging station 50.0 kW), 38 minutes (DC charging station 100.0 kW)\n | 100%: 450 minutes (AC single-phase wallbox/charging station 7.2 kW); 80%: 53 minutes (DC charging station 50.0 kW), 38 minutes (DC charging station 100.0 kW)\n | 100%: 450 minutes (AC 3-phase wallbox/charging station 11.0 kW); 80%: 38 minutes (DC charging station 125.0 kW)\n | 100%: 450 minutes (AC 3-phase wallbox/charging station 11.0 kW); 80%: 29 minutes (DC charging station 135.0 kW)\n | 100%: 450 minutes (AC 3-phase wallbox/charging station 11.0 kW); 80%: 38 minutes (DC charging station 125.0 kW)\n | 100%: 450 minutes (AC 3-phase wallbox/charging station 11.0 kW); 80%: 38 minutes (DC charging station 125.0 kW)\n | 100%: 450 minutes (AC 3-phase wallbox/charging station 11.0 kW); 80%: 36 minutes (DC charging station 135.0 kW)\n | 100%: 450 minutes (AC 3-phase wallbox/charging station 11.0 kW); 80%: 36 minutes (DC charging station 135.0 kW)\n |\n\n\n## Markets[edit]\n\n\n### Europe[edit]\n\n\nFor the European market, the ID.4 is available with four electric motor options. The versions with 146 hp (148 PS; 109 kW) or 168 hp (170 PS; 125 kW) are powered by a 52 kWh battery pack, while the larger 77 kWh battery can be paired with either a 172 hp (174 PS; 128 kW) or a 201 hp (204 PS; 150 kW) motor and has a WLTP range of \"up to\" 323 mi (520 km) on a single charge.[30] The range-topping model is capable of a 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) sprint in 8.5 seconds.[31][32]\n\n\nAn AWD variant of the ID.4, marketed as the **ID.4 GTX** in Europe,[27] accelerates 0–96 km/h (0–60 mph) in 5.7 seconds[26] and 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) in 6.2 seconds.[27]\n\n\nThe ID.4 is produced at the Volkswagen Zwickau-Mosel Plant in Germany since start of production and is also built at the company's Emden plant since May 2022.[33]\n[34]\n\n\n\n* ![Volkswagen ID.4 GTX](image)\n\nVolkswagen ID.4 GTX\n* ![Volkswagen ID.4 GTX](image)\n\nVolkswagen ID.4 GTX\n* ![Interior](image)\n\nInterior\n\n\n### North America[edit]\n\n\nFor the North American market, the available configurations are a RWD configuration that produces 201 horsepower (150 kW) and 229 pound-feet (310 N⋅m) of torque or an AWD configuration that produces 295 horsepower (220 kW) and 339 pound-feet (460 N⋅m) of torque. It is powered by a 62 kWh or 82 kWh battery pack (gross capacity) positioned in the underbody. The 82 kWh battery pack offers a range of 245–280 mi (394–451 km) on a full charge on the EPA cycle, depending on version.[35] The 62 kWh battery pack is rated at 209 miles (336 km) by the EPA.[36]\n\n\n2021-2022 models were imported to North America and built in the Volkswagen Zwickau-Mosel Plant or Emden plant since model year 2022.[34]\n\n\nIn August 2022, Volkswagen announced production location changes and added features for 2023 model year ID.4s, the Volkswagen ID.4 sold in North America will be made in Volkswagen's Chattanooga Tennessee Assembly Plant.\nChattanooga began producing the ID.4 on July 26, 2022.[37]\n\n\nThe North American ID.4 got a moderate refresh for model year 2023. It introduced a new 62 kWh battery pack that is now on the new Standard and S trim levels. The 62 kWh (gross) battery pack is provided exclusively by SK On and has a peak charging rate of 140 kW.\nThe Standard trim level reduced the base price of the ID.4 to $37,495 (up to $38,995 since December 2022). \nThe larger 82 kWh (gross) battery pack got updated and since December 2022, it is split between two battery suppliers to increase production output, SK On and LG Energy Solution. On 82 kWh *RWD* models, some vehicles get the SK On battery pack providing a 170 kW peak charging speed, while other vehicles get the LG Energy Solutions battery pack with a 135 kW peak charging speed as used in most pre-2023 model year vehicles. All 82 kWh *AWD* models get the SK On battery with the 170 kW peak charging. Volkswagen quotes a 10-80% DC fast charging time of 30 minutes for the SK On battery pack and 36 minutes for the LG battery pack. The battery capacity and EPA rated range are identical between the two battery packs.[38]\n\n\nThe 2023 refresh also includes a redesigned center console, a larger 12-inch Discover Pro Max infotainment system, Park Assist Plus (autonomous parking system), assisted lane changing to the semi-autonomous highway assist system branded Volkswagen Travel Assist (Travel Assist is standard on every North American ID.4, however, 2021-22 models do not have the assisted lane change function) and 45-watt USB-C fast device charging standard across all trims. As well as new options like Area View (surround view camera system), three-zone automatic climate control, heated rear seats, and new paint colors.[39]\n\n\n\n### China[edit]\n\n\nThe Volkswagen ID.4 is available as two variants in China called the ID.4 X and the ID.4 Crozz. The two variants feature slightly different styling and are produced by SAIC-Volkswagen and FAW-Volkswagen respectively.[40]\n\n\n\nThe ID.4 Crozz is similar to the European ID.4 and is offered with a smaller battery and a range of 400 km (249 mi) and 125 kW (168 hp; 170 PS) of power as well as a longer-ranged version offering 550 km (342 mi) of range according to the NEDC test and 150 kW (201 hp; 204 PS) of power. A high performance version with dual motor all-wheel drive and 225 kW (302 hp; 306 PS) as well as 520 km (323 mi) of range is to be released as well.[41] For the SAIC-Volkswagen ID.4 X, the car gains 20 mm (0.8 in) in length, mainly through the addition of a different bumper.[42]\n\n* ![Volkswagen ID.4 X (China)](image)\n\nVolkswagen ID.4 X (China)\n* ![Volkswagen ID.4 X (China)](image)\n\nVolkswagen ID.4 X (China)\n* ![Volkswagen ID.4 Crozz (China)](image)\n\nVolkswagen ID.4 Crozz (China)\n* ![Volkswagen ID.4 Crozz (China)](image)\n\nVolkswagen ID.4 Crozz (China)\n* ![Volkswagen ID.4 Crozz interior](image)\n\nVolkswagen ID.4 Crozz interior\n* ![Volkswagen ID.4 Crozz and ID.4 X side by side](image)\n\nVolkswagen ID.4 Crozz and ID.4 X side by side\n\n\n## Sales and marketing[edit]\n\n\n\n\nID.4 sales\n| Year\n | Europe[43] | US\n | China\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ID.4 X[44] | ID.4 Crozz[45] |\n| 2020\n | 4,810\n |  |  |  |\n| 2021\n | 53,605\n | 16,742[46] | 23,174\n | 26,853\n |\n| 2022\n | 67,655\n | 20,511[47] | 33,761\n | 34,273\n |\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the 2023 French animated film *Ladybug & Cat Noir: The Movie*, Cat Noir drives an ID.4, following a deal between Volkswagen and French company ZAG Inc.[48]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Volkswagen ID.3\n* Volkswagen ID.

It is the first product to be marketed under the electric cars-focused Ioniq sub-brand, and the first model developed on the Hyundai Electric Global Modular Platform (E-GMP).[12]\n\n\n\n\n## Overview[edit]\n\n\nThe Ioniq 5 was revealed globally on 23 February 2021.[13] Its design was previewed by the Hyundai 45 EV Concept which was presented at the Frankfurt Motor Show in September 2019. Both the concept car and the production version are inspired by the original Hyundai Pony,[14] and features the Parametric Pixel design that is applied to the headlights, tail lights, and wheels. The vehicle's clamshell hood spans the entire width to make a sleek look with the 20-inch aerodynamic wheels.[15] The \"45\" describes both the 45th anniversary of the Pony coupe and the 45-degree angles prominent on the sides of the concept.[16] At the time, Hyundai called the design language \"sensuous sportiness\" and described the front and rear lights as carrying a \"kinetic cube\" theme.[17]\n\n\nThe Ioniq 5 was developed under the project code *NE* as the first vehicle to be based on the E-GMP platform.[18][19] The dedicated electric vehicle platform enables the vehicle to adopt a fully flat interior floor with a 3-meter long wheelbase. The flat floor allows Hyundai engineers to develop a sliding front central console marketed as 'Universal Island', which is able to slide backwards by 140 mm (5.5 in). The vehicle has a cargo capacity of 531 L (18.8 cu ft) behind the rear seats that can be increased to nearly 1,600 L (56.5 cu ft) with the second row seats folded. The rear legroom space was achieved by making the front seats approximately 30 percent thinner than typical seats.[20]\n\n\nThe dashboard of the Ioniq 5 is made up of two 12 in (300 mm) screens, one for the instrument cluster display and the other for the infotainment system, both under one piece of glass. It is equipped with an optional head-up display with augmented reality support. Many of the interior parts are made from recycled materials, including PET bottles. The Ioniq 5 can be optioned with a single large glass panel roof without any support beams.[21]\n\n\nThe Ioniq 5 also features a front boot (alternatively called a frunk), which has a 57 L (2.01 cu ft) capacity for the RWD version (except North America), while the AWD model and all North American versions have a 24 L (0.848 cu ft) capacity, due to the extra mechanical components underneath to support the front electric motor.[22] It has the ability to charge electrical equipment through the built-in V2L (Vehicle to Load) function. It can supply up to 3.6 kW of power from the port mounted under the rear seats (except Australia) and from another port installed outside. The exterior port is able to supply power even if the vehicle is turned off.\n\n\nIn some markets, the Ioniq 5 is offered with an optional Digital Side Mirror (DSM) which replaces the conventional side mirrors with cameras and OLED screens.[23]\n\n\n\n* ![Rear view](image)\n\nRear view\n* ![Interior](image)\n\nInterior\n* ![Hyundai 45 EV Concept (2019)](image)\n\nHyundai 45 EV Concept (2019)\n\n\n##  Ioniq 5 N[edit]\n\n\nThe Ioniq 5 N was introduced on 14 July 2023 during the Goodwood Festival of Speed. The variant is the top-of-the-line model, marketed under the Hyundai N performance sub-brand.[24][25]\n\n\nThe exterior changes include a revised front end with larger air intakes, with additional air curtains and air flaps for improved cooling. The rear portion gained a rear wiper, wing-type spoiler integrated with a triangular third brake light, and a rear diffuser. With extended wheel arches and wider track, the Ioniq 5 N is 50 mm (2.0 in) wider than the standard model and also 20 mm (0.8 in) lower.[26]\n\n\nThe body in white structure of the Ioniq 5 N gains 42 additional welding points and 2.1 m (83 in) of additional adhesives for improved rigidity. The motor and battery mountings were also reinforced, while the subframes were enhanced for lateral rigidity. Its power steering has a higher ratio and improved torque feedback.\n\n\nThe vehicle is equipped with two electric motors, providing a total of 448 kW (609 PS; 601 hp) and 740 N⋅m (75.5 kg⋅m; 546 lb⋅ft) of torque. However, Hyundai equipped the Ioniq 5 N with an N Grin Boost mode, allowing a maximum output of 478 kW (650 PS; 641 hp) and 770 N⋅m (78.5 kg⋅m; 568 lb⋅ft) of torque being released for 10 seconds. Hyundai claimed a 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) acceleration figure of 3.5 seconds, or 3.4 seconds with the N Grin Boost mode activated. The lithium-ion battery for this variant is also extended to 84 kWh.[26]\n\n\n\nSeveral aspects were conceived to simulate an internal combustion vehicle. An N e-shift function emulates the feel of a 8-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission, by controlling motor torque to simulate the jolt between shifts. A system called N Active Sound+ uses eight interior and two exterior speakers to play three different sound themes based on throttle position, such as a 2.0-liter turbocharged petrol engine from other Hyundai N cars, futuristic EV themes and twin-engine fighter jet sounds.[27]\n\n* ![Ioniq 5 N](image)\n\nIoniq 5 N\n* ![Rear view](image)\n\nRear view\n* ![Interior](image)\n\nInterior\n\n\n## Powertrain[edit]\n\n\nFrom vehicle launch to mid-2022, the international market Long Range Ioniq 5 initially had 72.6 kWh gross battery pack, which has since then been upgraded to 77.4 kWh gross capacity, a 58 kWh gross battery pack is available for the Standard Range model. The North American version is only available with the 58 kWh for Standard Range models or the newer 77.4 kWh batteries for Long Range models. Every Ioniq 5 has a top speed of 185 km/h (115 mph).[28]\n\n\nThe battery can recharge 86 km (53 mi) of range in 5 minutes, or from 10 to 80% in 18 minutes, or 375 km (233 mi) in half an hour[29] with its 800 V charging capabilities by using a 350 kW charger. The peak battery speeds for the 58 kWh Standard Range are around 175 kW while it is around 230 kW on the 77.4 kWh Long Range. The 800 V inverter is sourced from Vitesco Technologies, a subsidiary of the Continental group.[30] A five minutes charge will add 100 km (62 mi) to its range by WLTP standards.[31]\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecifications[32][33][34][35][36]\n| Battery\n | Layout\n | Power\n | Torque\n | 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph)(official)\n | Range (claimed)\n | Top speed\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Ioniq 5\n |\n| 58 kWh(Standard Range)\n | RWD\n | 125 kW (170 PS; 168 hp)\n | 350 N⋅m (258 lb⋅ft)\n | 8.5 s\n | 354 km (220 mi) (EPA)384 km (239 mi) (WLTP)336 km (209 mi) (Korea)\n | 185 km/h (115 mph)\n |\n| AWD\n | 53 kW (72 PS; 71 hp) (front motor)\n | 255 N⋅m (188 lb⋅ft) (F)\n | 6.1 s\n | 360 km (224 mi) (WLTP)319 km (198 mi) (Korea)\n |\n| 120 kW (163 PS; 161 hp) (R)\n | 350 N⋅m (258 lb⋅ft) (R)\n |\n| 173 kW (235 PS; 232 hp) (combined)\n | 605 N⋅m (446 lb⋅ft) (combined)\n |\n| 72.6 kWh(Long Range)\n | RWD\n | 160 kW (218 PS; 215 hp)\n | 350 N⋅m (258 lb⋅ft)\n | 7.4 s\n | 451–481 km (280–299 mi) (WLTP)[37]401–429 km (249–267 mi) (Korea)\n |\n| AWD\n | 70 kW (95 PS; 94 hp) (front motor)\n | 255 N⋅m (188 lb⋅ft) (F)\n | 5.2 s\n | 430–460 km (267–286 mi) (WLTP)370–390 km (230–242 mi) (Korea)\n |\n| 155 kW (211 PS; 208 hp) (R)\n | 350 N⋅m (258 lb⋅ft) (R)\n |\n| 225 kW (306 PS; 302 hp) (combined)\n | 605 N⋅m (446 lb⋅ft) (combined)\n |\n| 77.4 kWh(Extra Long Range)\n | RWD\n | 168 kW (228 PS; 225 hp)\n | 350 N⋅m (258 lb⋅ft)\n | 7.3 s\n | 488 km (303 mi) (EPA)\n |\n| AWD\n | 74 kW (101 PS; 99 hp) (front motor)\n | 255 N⋅m (188 lb⋅ft) (F)\n | 5.1 s\n | 412 km (256 mi) (EPA)\n |\n| 165 kW (224 PS; 221 hp) (R)\n | 350 N⋅m (258 lb⋅ft) (R)\n |\n| 239 kW (325 PS; 321 hp) (combined)\n | 605 N⋅m (446 lb⋅ft) (combined)\n |\n| Ioniq 5 N\n |\n| 84 kWh\n | AWD\n | 478 kW (650 PS; 641 hp)\n | 740 N⋅m (546 lb⋅ft)\n | 3.4 s\n |  | 260 km/h (162 mph)\n |\n\n\n## Markets[edit]\n\n\n### United States[edit]\n\n\nThe Ioniq 5 was released in the U.S. in May 2021, and went on sale in December 2021 as a 2022-year model.[38] The initial model year is equipped with a 77.4 kWh battery.

It is the first product to be marketed under the electric cars-focused Ioniq sub-brand, and the first model developed on the Hyundai Electric Global Modular Platform (E-GMP).[12]\n\n\n\n\n## Overview[edit]\n\n\nThe Ioniq 5 was revealed globally on 23 February 2021.[13] Its design was previewed by the Hyundai 45 EV Concept which was presented at the Frankfurt Motor Show in September 2019. Both the concept car and the production version are inspired by the original Hyundai Pony,[14] and features the Parametric Pixel design that is applied to the headlights, tail lights, and wheels. The vehicle's clamshell hood spans the entire width to make a sleek look with the 20-inch aerodynamic wheels.[15] The \"45\" describes both the 45th anniversary of the Pony coupe and the 45-degree angles prominent on the sides of the concept.[16] At the time, Hyundai called the design language \"sensuous sportiness\" and described the front and rear lights as carrying a \"kinetic cube\" theme.[17]\n\n\nThe Ioniq 5 was developed under the project code *NE* as the first vehicle to be based on the E-GMP platform.[18][19] The dedicated electric vehicle platform enables the vehicle to adopt a fully flat interior floor with a 3-meter long wheelbase. The flat floor allows Hyundai engineers to develop a sliding front central console marketed as 'Universal Island', which is able to slide backwards by 140 mm (5.5 in). The vehicle has a cargo capacity of 531 L (18.8 cu ft) behind the rear seats that can be increased to nearly 1,600 L (56.5 cu ft) with the second row seats folded. The rear legroom space was achieved by making the front seats approximately 30 percent thinner than typical seats.[20]\n\n\nThe dashboard of the Ioniq 5 is made up of two 12 in (300 mm) screens, one for the instrument cluster display and the other for the infotainment system, both under one piece of glass. It is equipped with an optional head-up display with augmented reality support. Many of the interior parts are made from recycled materials, including PET bottles. The Ioniq 5 can be optioned with a single large glass panel roof without any support beams.[21]\n\n\nThe Ioniq 5 also features a front boot (alternatively called a frunk), which has a 57 L (2.01 cu ft) capacity for the RWD version (except North America), while the AWD model and all North American versions have a 24 L (0.848 cu ft) capacity, due to the extra mechanical components underneath to support the front electric motor.[22] It has the ability to charge electrical equipment through the built-in V2L (Vehicle to Load) function. It can supply up to 3.6 kW of power from the port mounted under the rear seats (except Australia) and from another port installed outside. The exterior port is able to supply power even if the vehicle is turned off.\n\n\nIn some markets, the Ioniq 5 is offered with an optional Digital Side Mirror (DSM) which replaces the conventional side mirrors with cameras and OLED screens.[23]\n\n\n\n* ![Rear view](image)\n\nRear view\n* ![Interior](image)\n\nInterior\n* ![Hyundai 45 EV Concept (2019)](image)\n\nHyundai 45 EV Concept (2019)\n\n\n##  Ioniq 5 N[edit]\n\n\nThe Ioniq 5 N was introduced on 14 July 2023 during the Goodwood Festival of Speed. The variant is the top-of-the-line model, marketed under the Hyundai N performance sub-brand.[24][25]\n\n\nThe exterior changes include a revised front end with larger air intakes, with additional air curtains and air flaps for improved cooling. The rear portion gained a rear wiper, wing-type spoiler integrated with a triangular third brake light, and a rear diffuser. With extended wheel arches and wider track, the Ioniq 5 N is 50 mm (2.0 in) wider than the standard model and also 20 mm (0.8 in) lower.[26]\n\n\nThe body in white structure of the Ioniq 5 N gains 42 additional welding points and 2.1 m (83 in) of additional adhesives for improved rigidity. The motor and battery mountings were also reinforced, while the subframes were enhanced for lateral rigidity. Its power steering has a higher ratio and improved torque feedback.\n\n\nThe vehicle is equipped with two electric motors, providing a total of 448 kW (609 PS; 601 hp) and 740 N⋅m (75.5 kg⋅m; 546 lb⋅ft) of torque. However, Hyundai equipped the Ioniq 5 N with an N Grin Boost mode, allowing a maximum output of 478 kW (650 PS; 641 hp) and 770 N⋅m (78.5 kg⋅m; 568 lb⋅ft) of torque being released for 10 seconds. Hyundai claimed a 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) acceleration figure of 3.5 seconds, or 3.4 seconds with the N Grin Boost mode activated. The lithium-ion battery for this variant is also extended to 84 kWh.[26]\n\n\n\nSeveral aspects were conceived to simulate an internal combustion vehicle. An N e-shift function emulates the feel of a 8-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission, by controlling motor torque to simulate the jolt between shifts. A system called N Active Sound+ uses eight interior and two exterior speakers to play three different sound themes based on throttle position, such as a 2.0-liter turbocharged petrol engine from other Hyundai N cars, futuristic EV themes and twin-engine fighter jet sounds.[27]\n\n* ![Ioniq 5 N](image)\n\nIoniq 5 N\n* ![Rear view](image)\n\nRear view\n* ![Interior](image)\n\nInterior\n\n\n## Powertrain[edit]\n\n\nFrom vehicle launch to mid-2022, the international market Long Range Ioniq 5 initially had 72.6 kWh gross battery pack, which has since then been upgraded to 77.4 kWh gross capacity, a 58 kWh gross battery pack is available for the Standard Range model. The North American version is only available with the 58 kWh for Standard Range models or the newer 77.4 kWh batteries for Long Range models. Every Ioniq 5 has a top speed of 185 km/h (115 mph).[28]\n\n\nThe battery can recharge 86 km (53 mi) of range in 5 minutes, or from 10 to 80% in 18 minutes, or 375 km (233 mi) in half an hour[29] with its 800 V charging capabilities by using a 350 kW charger. The peak battery speeds for the 58 kWh Standard Range are around 175 kW while it is around 230 kW on the 77.4 kWh Long Range. The 800 V inverter is sourced from Vitesco Technologies, a subsidiary of the Continental group.[30] A five minutes charge will add 100 km (62 mi) to its range by WLTP standards.[31]\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecifications[32][33][34][35][36]\n| Battery\n | Layout\n | Power\n | Torque\n | 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph)(official)\n | Range (claimed)\n | Top speed\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Ioniq 5\n |\n| 58 kWh(Standard Range)\n | RWD\n | 125 kW (170 PS; 168 hp)\n | 350 N⋅m (258 lb⋅ft)\n | 8.5 s\n | 354 km (220 mi) (EPA)384 km (239 mi) (WLTP)336 km (209 mi) (Korea)\n | 185 km/h (115 mph)\n |\n| AWD\n | 53 kW (72 PS; 71 hp) (front motor)\n | 255 N⋅m (188 lb⋅ft) (F)\n | 6.1 s\n | 360 km (224 mi) (WLTP)319 km (198 mi) (Korea)\n |\n| 120 kW (163 PS; 161 hp) (R)\n | 350 N⋅m (258 lb⋅ft) (R)\n |\n| 173 kW (235 PS; 232 hp) (combined)\n | 605 N⋅m (446 lb⋅ft) (combined)\n |\n| 72.6 kWh(Long Range)\n | RWD\n | 160 kW (218 PS; 215 hp)\n | 350 N⋅m (258 lb⋅ft)\n | 7.4 s\n | 451–481 km (280–299 mi) (WLTP)[37]401–429 km (249–267 mi) (Korea)\n |\n| AWD\n | 70 kW (95 PS; 94 hp) (front motor)\n | 255 N⋅m (188 lb⋅ft) (F)\n | 5.2 s\n | 430–460 km (267–286 mi) (WLTP)370–390 km (230–242 mi) (Korea)\n |\n| 155 kW (211 PS; 208 hp) (R)\n | 350 N⋅m (258 lb⋅ft) (R)\n |\n| 225 kW (306 PS; 302 hp) (combined)\n | 605 N⋅m (446 lb⋅ft) (combined)\n |\n| 77.4 kWh(Extra Long Range)\n | RWD\n | 168 kW (228 PS; 225 hp)\n | 350 N⋅m (258 lb⋅ft)\n | 7.3 s\n | 488 km (303 mi) (EPA)\n |\n| AWD\n | 74 kW (101 PS; 99 hp) (front motor)\n | 255 N⋅m (188 lb⋅ft) (F)\n | 5.1 s\n | 412 km (256 mi) (EPA)\n |\n| 165 kW (224 PS; 221 hp) (R)\n | 350 N⋅m (258 lb⋅ft) (R)\n |\n| 239 kW (325 PS; 321 hp) (combined)\n | 605 N⋅m (446 lb⋅ft) (combined)\n |\n| Ioniq 5 N\n |\n| 84 kWh\n | AWD\n | 478 kW (650 PS; 641 hp)\n | 740 N⋅m (546 lb⋅ft)\n | 3.4 s\n |  | 260 km/h (162 mph)\n |\n\n\n## Markets[edit]\n\n\n### United States[edit]\n\n\nThe Ioniq 5 was released in the U.S. in May 2021, and went on sale in December 2021 as a 2022-year model.[38] The initial model year is equipped with a 77.4 kWh battery.

It is the second vehicle marketed under the electric car-focused Ioniq sub-brand, and the fourth model developed on the Hyundai Electric Global Modular Platform (E-GMP).[4][5] The vehicle was first sold in South Korea in late 2022, with deliveries in the United States beginning in March 2023.\n\n\n\n\n## Overview[edit]\n\n\nThe Ioniq 6 was launched on 12 July 2022. It is produced at the Asan plant in South Korea, which also produces the Sonata and Grandeur,[6] starting in the third quarter of 2022.[7] Pre-orders started in July 2022.[8] Deliveries started in South Korea and selected European markets in late 2022. For the United States market, production started in January 2023, with sales beginning in March.[7]\n\n\nOn 14 July 2022, the Ioniq 6 was unveiled at the 2022 Busan International Motor Show in South Korea.[9] EV performance tuning technology, electric vehicle virtual driving sound, and electric vehicle active sound design were applied. The vehicle's software can be improved with over-the-air updates, including the car's suspension, brakes, and airbags. In addition, driving assistance technologies such as navigation-based smart cruise control, highway driving assistance, and remote smart parking assistance are available.[8]\n\n\nIn November 2022, the Ioniq 6 achieved the highest overall rating in the Euro NCAP, including adult occupant protection, child occupant protection, pedestrian protection, and safety assistance systems.[10]\n\n\n\n* ![Rear view](image)\n\nRear view\n* ![](image)\n\nInterior\n\n\n### Design development[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hyundai Prophecy concept car\nThe Ioniq 6 was developed under the codename CE.[11] It was previewed by the Prophecy concept car which was showcased in March 2020.[12]\n\n\nA design sketch was released first as a teaser image on 21 June 2022.[13] The concept sketch of the car represented the \"Electrified Streamliner\" design approach, built on Hyundai's new E-GMP platform; the sketch showed a soft streamlined design that minimizes wind resistance. A long wheelbase was applied compared to the overall height.[14]\n\n\nA series of photos showing details were released in the days leading up to 29 June 2022, when an overall photograph of the Ioniq 6 was unveiled.[15][16]\n\n\nSimilar to the Ioniq 5, the \"Parametric Pixel\" design is applied to the front lights. In addition, the Ioniq 6 is the first vehicle to use Hyundai's new stylized-H emblem, which was manufactured in the form of a thin plane made of aluminium. The side profile incorporates a streamlined window line, a built-in flush door handle, and optional side-mounted Digital Side Mirror (DSM) replacing conventional side mirrors. Attention to these and other aerodynamic details such as rear spoilers, external active air flaps, and wheel air curtains were credited for lowering the coefficient of drag to 0.21. The rear of the vehicle combines the rear spoiler with parametric pixel auxiliary braking light.[17]\n\n\nHyundai Executive Vice President SangYup Lee, who leads the Hyundai Design Centre, described the interior as \"a mindful cocoon that offers personalized place for all\".[16] The extended interior space is created by the vehicle's long wheelbase. The vehicle function operation unit was designed to be centralized and the storage space was expanded by applying a bridge-type centre console. In addition, eco-friendly materials were applied to interior and exterior painting, sheets, dashboards, and headliners.[17]\n\n\n\n### RN22e[edit]\n\n\nThe *RN22e* concept is derived from the Ioniq 6 and carries the Hyundai N motorsport sub-brand; it also was revealed in July 2022. The RN22e previews an Ioniq 6 N high-performance variant for regular production;[18] it is equipped with an all-wheel drive powertrain featuring upgraded traction motors that have outputs of 160 and 270 kW (218 and 367 PS; 215 and 362 hp) front and rear, respectively, and electronic torque vectoring on the rear differential using a twin-clutch system, branded e-TVTC.[19][20] Combined output is 430 kW (585 PS; 577 hp) and 740 N⋅m (546 lbf⋅ft), identical to the drivetrain of the Kia EV6 GT.[21] The motors now rotate at up to 20,000 RPM, compared to 15,000 RPM in the regular Ioniq 6, increasing top speed. Power is supplied by a 77.4 kW-hr battery.[22]\n\n\nCompared to the regular Ioniq 6, the RN22e is 2.4 in (61 mm) longer and 5.7 in (140 mm) wider, rolling on 21-inch wheels.[21] The cooling system has been upgraded to prevent overheating of the battery and motors.[20] It is equipped with an optional \"gearshift mode\" which simulates engine noises and a paddle-shifted transmission implemented by briefly decreasing motor output, which was called \"surprisingly convincing\" but slowed the car's overall lap time.[22]\n\n\nThe RN22e is being used to test components that will be fitted to the racing variant of the Ioniq 6, with which Hyundai N plan to campaign in the eTouring Car World Cup series starting in 2023. The forthcoming Ioniq 6-based racing car will replace the Veloster N ETCR that was raced in 2021 and 2022.[22] During a hands-on session at the Bilster Berg track, *Motor Trend* writer Angus MacKenzie noted \"the RN22e was setup deliberately to be something of a show-off drift king, to prove an EV can make you smile behind the wheel\".[22]\n\n\n\n* ![Hyundai RN22e Front View](image)\n\nHyundai RN22e Front View\n* ![Hyundai RN22e Rear View](image)\n\nHyundai RN22e Rear View\n\n\n## Specifications[edit]\n\n\n\n\nPowertrain[23][24]\n| Battery\n | Layout\n | Power\n | Torque\n | 0–100 km/h(0–62 mph)(official)\n | Top speed\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 53 kWh(Standard Range)\n | RWD\n | 111 kW (151 PS; 149 hp)\n | 350 N⋅m (258 lb⋅ft)\n | 8.8 s\n | 185 km/h (115 mph)\n |\n| 77.4 kWh(Long Range)\n | RWD\n | 168 kW (228 PS; 225 hp)\n | 350 N⋅m (258 lb⋅ft)\n | 7.4 s\n |\n| AWD\n | 239 kW (325 PS; 321 hp)[a] | 605 N⋅m (446 lb⋅ft)[a] | 5.1 s\n |\n\n\nNotes\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Combined output from front and rear motors\n\nEstimated range is 610 km (380 mi) for the RWD version with the larger (Long Range, 77.4 kWh) battery, using the WLTP cycle.[9] Under Korean test standards, the long-range RWD version with 18-inch wheels was expected to have a range of 524 km (326 mi).[8] For models sold in the United States, the EPA ratings are 361 mi (581 km) for the Long Range RWD and 316 mi (509 km) for the Long Range AWD models with 18-inch wheels; with the larger 20-inch wheels, range drops to 305 and 270 mi (491 and 435 km) for the RWD and AWD versions, respectively.[25]\n\n\nThe standard range version with the smaller 53 kWh battery and 18-inch wheels is expected to have a consumption of less than 14 kWh/100 km (150 mpg‑e),[26] about equal to the shorter range Hyundai Ioniq Electric. The Standard Model was originally not planned to be marketed in the United States [26] but ended up being marketed.[27]\n\n\nUsing an 800 V DC charger supplying 350 kW, the vehicle's battery can be charged from 10% to 80% in 18 minutes.[26] In the United States, new Ioniq 6 vehicles receive two years of unlimited 30-minute free charging sessions at DC fast chargers owned by Electrify America.[28]\n\n\n\n## Awards[edit]\n\n\n* World Car of The Year 2023[29][30]\n* World Car Design of The Year 2023[31][30]\n* World Electric Vehicle of The Year 2023[32][30]\n\n\n## Sales[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | South Korea[33] | United States\n | Europe\n | Global sales\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2022\n | 11,289\n | 0\n | 6\n | 14,821\n |\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Hyundai Ioniq 6 Throws a Curveball at the EV Market\". 4 October 2022.\n2. **^** Mihalascu, Dan (28 June 2022). \"2023 Hyundai Ioniq 6 Final Teaser Drops Ahead Of June 29 Unveiling\". *InsideEVs*.

It is the second vehicle marketed under the electric car-focused Ioniq sub-brand, and the fourth model developed on the Hyundai Electric Global Modular Platform (E-GMP).[4][5] The vehicle was first sold in South Korea in late 2022, with deliveries in the United States beginning in March 2023.\n\n\n\n\n## Overview[edit]\n\n\nThe Ioniq 6 was launched on 12 July 2022. It is produced at the Asan plant in South Korea, which also produces the Sonata and Grandeur,[6] starting in the third quarter of 2022.[7] Pre-orders started in July 2022.[8] Deliveries started in South Korea and selected European markets in late 2022. For the United States market, production started in January 2023, with sales beginning in March.[7]\n\n\nOn 14 July 2022, the Ioniq 6 was unveiled at the 2022 Busan International Motor Show in South Korea.[9] EV performance tuning technology, electric vehicle virtual driving sound, and electric vehicle active sound design were applied. The vehicle's software can be improved with over-the-air updates, including the car's suspension, brakes, and airbags. In addition, driving assistance technologies such as navigation-based smart cruise control, highway driving assistance, and remote smart parking assistance are available.[8]\n\n\nIn November 2022, the Ioniq 6 achieved the highest overall rating in the Euro NCAP, including adult occupant protection, child occupant protection, pedestrian protection, and safety assistance systems.[10]\n\n\n\n* ![Rear view](image)\n\nRear view\n* ![](image)\n\nInterior\n\n\n### Design development[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hyundai Prophecy concept car\nThe Ioniq 6 was developed under the codename CE.[11] It was previewed by the Prophecy concept car which was showcased in March 2020.[12]\n\n\nA design sketch was released first as a teaser image on 21 June 2022.[13] The concept sketch of the car represented the \"Electrified Streamliner\" design approach, built on Hyundai's new E-GMP platform; the sketch showed a soft streamlined design that minimizes wind resistance. A long wheelbase was applied compared to the overall height.[14]\n\n\nA series of photos showing details were released in the days leading up to 29 June 2022, when an overall photograph of the Ioniq 6 was unveiled.[15][16]\n\n\nSimilar to the Ioniq 5, the \"Parametric Pixel\" design is applied to the front lights. In addition, the Ioniq 6 is the first vehicle to use Hyundai's new stylized-H emblem, which was manufactured in the form of a thin plane made of aluminium. The side profile incorporates a streamlined window line, a built-in flush door handle, and optional side-mounted Digital Side Mirror (DSM) replacing conventional side mirrors. Attention to these and other aerodynamic details such as rear spoilers, external active air flaps, and wheel air curtains were credited for lowering the coefficient of drag to 0.21. The rear of the vehicle combines the rear spoiler with parametric pixel auxiliary braking light.[17]\n\n\nHyundai Executive Vice President SangYup Lee, who leads the Hyundai Design Centre, described the interior as \"a mindful cocoon that offers personalized place for all\".[16] The extended interior space is created by the vehicle's long wheelbase. The vehicle function operation unit was designed to be centralized and the storage space was expanded by applying a bridge-type centre console. In addition, eco-friendly materials were applied to interior and exterior painting, sheets, dashboards, and headliners.[17]\n\n\n\n### RN22e[edit]\n\n\nThe *RN22e* concept is derived from the Ioniq 6 and carries the Hyundai N motorsport sub-brand; it also was revealed in July 2022. The RN22e previews an Ioniq 6 N high-performance variant for regular production;[18] it is equipped with an all-wheel drive powertrain featuring upgraded traction motors that have outputs of 160 and 270 kW (218 and 367 PS; 215 and 362 hp) front and rear, respectively, and electronic torque vectoring on the rear differential using a twin-clutch system, branded e-TVTC.[19][20] Combined output is 430 kW (585 PS; 577 hp) and 740 N⋅m (546 lbf⋅ft), identical to the drivetrain of the Kia EV6 GT.[21] The motors now rotate at up to 20,000 RPM, compared to 15,000 RPM in the regular Ioniq 6, increasing top speed. Power is supplied by a 77.4 kW-hr battery.[22]\n\n\nCompared to the regular Ioniq 6, the RN22e is 2.4 in (61 mm) longer and 5.7 in (140 mm) wider, rolling on 21-inch wheels.[21] The cooling system has been upgraded to prevent overheating of the battery and motors.[20] It is equipped with an optional \"gearshift mode\" which simulates engine noises and a paddle-shifted transmission implemented by briefly decreasing motor output, which was called \"surprisingly convincing\" but slowed the car's overall lap time.[22]\n\n\nThe RN22e is being used to test components that will be fitted to the racing variant of the Ioniq 6, with which Hyundai N plan to campaign in the eTouring Car World Cup series starting in 2023. The forthcoming Ioniq 6-based racing car will replace the Veloster N ETCR that was raced in 2021 and 2022.[22] During a hands-on session at the Bilster Berg track, *Motor Trend* writer Angus MacKenzie noted \"the RN22e was setup deliberately to be something of a show-off drift king, to prove an EV can make you smile behind the wheel\".[22]\n\n\n\n* ![Hyundai RN22e Front View](image)\n\nHyundai RN22e Front View\n* ![Hyundai RN22e Rear View](image)\n\nHyundai RN22e Rear View\n\n\n## Specifications[edit]\n\n\n\n\nPowertrain[23][24]\n| Battery\n | Layout\n | Power\n | Torque\n | 0–100 km/h(0–62 mph)(official)\n | Top speed\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 53 kWh(Standard Range)\n | RWD\n | 111 kW (151 PS; 149 hp)\n | 350 N⋅m (258 lb⋅ft)\n | 8.8 s\n | 185 km/h (115 mph)\n |\n| 77.4 kWh(Long Range)\n | RWD\n | 168 kW (228 PS; 225 hp)\n | 350 N⋅m (258 lb⋅ft)\n | 7.4 s\n |\n| AWD\n | 239 kW (325 PS; 321 hp)[a] | 605 N⋅m (446 lb⋅ft)[a] | 5.1 s\n |\n\n\nNotes\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Combined output from front and rear motors\n\nEstimated range is 610 km (380 mi) for the RWD version with the larger (Long Range, 77.4 kWh) battery, using the WLTP cycle.[9] Under Korean test standards, the long-range RWD version with 18-inch wheels was expected to have a range of 524 km (326 mi).[8] For models sold in the United States, the EPA ratings are 361 mi (581 km) for the Long Range RWD and 316 mi (509 km) for the Long Range AWD models with 18-inch wheels; with the larger 20-inch wheels, range drops to 305 and 270 mi (491 and 435 km) for the RWD and AWD versions, respectively.[25]\n\n\nThe standard range version with the smaller 53 kWh battery and 18-inch wheels is expected to have a consumption of less than 14 kWh/100 km (150 mpg‑e),[26] about equal to the shorter range Hyundai Ioniq Electric. The Standard Model was originally not planned to be marketed in the United States [26] but ended up being marketed.[27]\n\n\nUsing an 800 V DC charger supplying 350 kW, the vehicle's battery can be charged from 10% to 80% in 18 minutes.[26] In the United States, new Ioniq 6 vehicles receive two years of unlimited 30-minute free charging sessions at DC fast chargers owned by Electrify America.[28]\n\n\n\n## Awards[edit]\n\n\n* World Car of The Year 2023[29][30]\n* World Car Design of The Year 2023[31][30]\n* World Electric Vehicle of The Year 2023[32][30]\n\n\n## Sales[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | South Korea[33] | United States\n | Europe\n | Global sales\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2022\n | 11,289\n | 0\n | 6\n | 14,821\n |\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Hyundai Ioniq 6 Throws a Curveball at the EV Market\". 4 October 2022.\n2. **^** Mihalascu, Dan (28 June 2022). \"2023 Hyundai Ioniq 6 Final Teaser Drops Ahead Of June 29 Unveiling\". *InsideEVs*.
