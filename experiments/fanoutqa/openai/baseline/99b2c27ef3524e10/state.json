Harrison in Oklahoma City ,Oklahoma, and opened Walton's 5 & 10.[1] The Walmart chain proper was founded in 1962 with a single store in Rogers, expanding inside Oklahoma by 1968 and throughout the rest of the Southern United States by the 1980s, ultimately operating a store in every state of the United States, plus its first stores in Canada, by 1995. The expansion was largely fueled by new store construction, although the chains Mohr-Value and Kuhn's Big K were also acquired. The company introduced its warehouse club chain Sam's Club in 1983 and its first Supercenter stores in 1998.\n\n\n\n\n## 1960s and 1970s[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Logo used from 1962 to 1964\nAt some point, Sam Walton made the decision to achieve higher sales volumes by keeping sales prices lower than his competitors by reducing his profit margin. Inspired by the successes of other discount department store chains, Walton opened the second store in Harrison, Arkansas, that year. Responsible for the purchase and maintenance of signage, Walton's assistant, Bob Bogle, came up with the name \"Wal-Mart\" for the new chain.[2] By 1967, the company grew to 24 stores across the state of Arkansas, and had reached $12.6 million in sales, and by 1968, the company opened its first stores outside of Arkansas in Sikeston, Missouri, and Claremore, Oklahoma.[3]\n\n\nThe company's first stock split occurred in May 1972 at a market price of $47 (~$260.00 in 2023). By this time, Walmart was operating in five states: Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri and Oklahoma, and expanded into Tennessee in 1973, and Kentucky and Mississippi in 1974. As the company expanded into Texas in 1975, there were 125 stores with 7,500 associates, and total sales of $340.3 million (~$1.5\u00a0billion in 2023).\n\n\n\n![](image)Logo used from 1964 to 1981\nBy 1977, Walmart expanded into Illinois and made its first corporate acquisition, assuming ownership and operation of the Mohr-Value stores, which operated in Missouri and Illinois.[4] This was followed by the acquisition of the Hutcheson Shoe Company in 1978. In the same year Walmart also branched out into several new markets, launching its pharmacy, auto service center, and jewelry divisions.\n\n\n\n## 1980s and 1990s[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Walmart Store 515, the first Walmart in the state of North Carolina, opening on August 16, 1983. This store has a new exterior design that was introduced in 2021. Taken August 27, 2023.\n![](image)A Wal-Mart store in the 1980s.\nIn 1981, Walmart expanded into the southeastern US market, opening stores in Alabama, Georgia and South Carolina, and acquiring 92 Kuhn's Big K stores. They expanded into Florida and Nebraska in 1982.\n\n\nIn April 1983, the company opened its first Sam's Club store, a membership-based discount warehouse club, in Midwest City, Oklahoma. They also expanded into Indiana, Iowa, New Mexico, and North Carolina and implemented \"people greeters\" in all of their stores. The first stores opened in Virginia in 1984.\n\n\nIn 1985, with 882 stores with sales of $8.4 billion and 104,000 associates, the company expanded into Wisconsin and Colorado, and the first stores opened in Minnesota in 1986.\n\n\nBy the company's 25th anniversary in 1987, there were offices to track inventory, sales, and send instant communication to their stores.[5] Continuing their technological upgrades, they had equipped 90% of their stores with barcode readers by 1988, to further assist in keeping track of their large inventory.\n\n\nIn February 1988, company founder Sam Walton stepped down as chief executive officer, and David Glass was named to succeed him.[6] Walton remained on as Chairman of the Corporate Board of Directors, and the company also restructured their senior management positions, elevating a cadre of executives to positions of greater responsibility.\n\n\nAlso in 1988, the first Wal-Mart Supercenter was opened in Washington, Missouri. The supercenter concept features everything contained in an average Walmart discount store, in addition to a tire and oil change shop, optical center, one-hour photo processing lab, portrait studio, and numerous alcove shops such as banks, cellular telephone stores, hair and nail salons, video rental stores, and fast food outlets.\n\n\nBy 1988, Wal-Mart was the most profitable retailer in the United States,[7] though it did not outsell K-Mart and Sears in terms of value of items purchased until late 1990 or early 1991.\n\n\nBy 1988, Walmart was operating in 27 states, having expanded into Arizona, Michigan, Ohio, West Virginia, New Jersey, and Wyoming. By 1990, they expanded into California (which marked Walmart officially becoming a fully nationwide retailer), Nevada, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, and Utah. The Walmart Visitor's Center also opened this year on the site of Sam Walton's original store.\n\n\nThe 1990s saw an era of furious growth on an unprecedented scale and the incorporation of several new ideas and technology into the business.\n\n\nIn 1990, US sales had quadrupled to $32 billion over the previous five years [4] and Walmart acquired The McLane Company, a food service distributor,[8] which was later sold to Berkshire Hathaway in 2003.[9]\n\n\nIn 1991, the company expanded into Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and New York. Walmart expanded worldwide this year, with the opening of their first store outside the United States in Mexico City. They also acquired Western Merchandisers, Inc. of Amarillo, Texas. 1991 also saw the launch of the *Sam's American Choice* brand of products \"Made in America\"[10] initiative, to stimulate American suppliers to produce more products and lower the price.\n\n\n\n![](image)Logo used from 1992 to 2008. This logo is still in use at many locations as hundreds of stores are being transitioned to the newest logo. They still use this logo on semi-truck trailers. The first version of this logo used a hyphen instead of a star.\n![](image)A Wal-Mart store with its 1990s exterior, taken in 2004.\nOn March 17, 1992 US President George H. W. Bush presented Sam Walton with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Walton died on April 5, 1992. His eldest son, S. Robson Walton, succeeded him as chairman of the corporate board of directors, on April 7, 1992. This year, Walmart had a presence in 45 states which by this time expanded into Idaho, Montana, and Oregon, as well as Puerto Rico.\n\n\nIn 1993, the Walmart International Division was formed with Bobby Martin as its president. The company also expanded into Alaska, Hawaii, Rhode Island and Washington. Their stores also achieved the billion-dollar sales mark in one week in December 1993.\n\n\nIn 1994, the National Advertising Review Board challenged the Walmart slogan, \"Always the low price. Always,\" contending that it implied that Walmart's prices were always the lowest and could mislead some shoppers. In response, Walmart adopted a new slogan, \"Always low prices. Always.\"[11]\n\n\nAlso in 1994, the Code Adam program was instituted in Walmart stores. That same year, Walmart acquired 91 PACE Membership Warehouse clubs from Kmart and 122 Woolco stores in Canada in 1994. In addition, it opened 3 value clubs in Hong Kong, and had 96 stores in Mexico.\n\n\nBy 1995, Walmart had 1,995 discount stores, 239 Supercenters, 433 SAM'S CLUBS and 276 international stores with sales at $93.6 billion (~$171\u00a0billion in 2023) (including US sales of $78 billion) and 675,000 associates. Walmart expanded into its final state (Vermont), and also expanded into South America, with three new units in Argentina and five in Brazil.\n\n\nThe company entered the Chinese market in 1996 through a joint-venture agreement. In 1996, a Walmart location in Dickson City, Pennsylvania closed after the building was damaged by a boulder (The location was replaced by a larger one in another part of Dickson City the following year.) The site was purchased by the neighboring Wegmans and demolished in 2016.[12] In 1997, Walmart replaced Woolworth on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The company had its first $100 billion sales year, with sales totaling $118.1 billion. Also this year, they acquired 21 Wertkauf stores in Germany, and introduced their OneSource nutrition centers.\n\n\nIn 1998, Walmart introduced the Neighborhood Market concept at three stores in Arkansas. Neighborhood Market stores are predominantly  grocery stores, and are intended to attract customers with easier parking, less crowded aisles, and quicker checkout compared to an average grocery store. Internationally Walmart enters South Korea by acquiring 4 stores operated by Korea Makro.\n\n\nAlso in 1998, Walmart launched its *Wal-Mart Television Network*, a vast, in-store advertising network showing commercials for products sold in the stores, concert clips and music videos for a recording artist's media, trailers for upcoming movie releases, and news.\n\n\nThe Asda chain in the United Kingdom became a subsidiary in 1999, and is the second largest chain in the UK after Tesco.\n\n\n\n## 21st century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)New and old Walmart logos outside store in Newburgh, New York, 2012 (Store #2104)\nIn 2000, Lee Scott was named president and CEO and US sales had doubled to $156 billion since 1995. That same year, Walmart was ranked fifth by Fortune magazine on its Global Most Admired All-Stars list and in 2003 and 2004, it was named as the most admired company in America.\n\n\nIn 2002, Walmart entered the Japanese market by acquiring a minor stake in Seiyu Group, who would become a wholly owned subsidiary of Walmart by 2008.\n\n\nIn 2005, Walmart had $312.4 billion (~$468\u00a0billion in 2023) in sales, more than 6,200 facilities around the world, including 3,800 stores in the United States and 3,800 international units, and more than 1.6 million associates employed worldwide. Their US presence had grown so rapidly that there were only small pockets of the country that remained further than 60 miles away from the nearest Walmart.[13] Approximately 138 million customers visited Walmart stores each week all over the world. Their corporate philanthropy efforts also assisted the US hurricane relief efforts with $18 million in cash donations. Through a purchase of stock in Central American Retail Holding Company (CARHCO), Walmart also entered the countries of Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica.\n\n\nOn May 22, 2006, Walmart announced the sale of its 16 stores in South Korea to Shinsegae Co, which rebranded the stores to E-Mart. Then on July 26, 2006 Walmart announced a complete pull-out from the German market; all existing 85 stores were sold to the Metro Group, which rebranded most of them to Real (hypermarket).\n\n\nOn September 12, 2007, for the first time in 13 years, Walmart introduced new advertising with the slogan, \"Save Money Live Better,\" instead of \"Always Low Prices, Always.\" It commissioned Global Insight for the ads and the report stated that as of 2006, the retailer saves American families $2,500 (~$3,778 in 2023) yearly (up 7.3% from $2,329, 2004). The new research found that the reduction in price levels due to Walmart resulted to savings for consumers of $287 billion in 2006, equivalent to $957 per person and $2,500 per household.\n\n\n\n![](image)Logo designed in 2008\nOn June 30, 2008, Walmart unveiled the company's new logo, which stylized the name as \"Walmart\". A spark, a symbol chosen to represent Walmart associates, replaces the star. In early 2009, Walmart entered Chile by acquiring Distribucion y Servicio D&S SA. In May 2009 Walmart entered into a 50/50 partnership with Bharti to gain access to the Indian market.\nAlso in 2008, a Walmart that was built atop a landfill in Garfield Heights, OH closed due to toxic fumes.\n\n\nOn February 22, 2010, the company confirmed it was acquiring the video streaming company Vudu, Inc. for an estimated $100 million (~$136\u00a0million in 2023).[14]\n\n\nIn June 2011, Walmart acquired 51% of Massmart Holdings. This acquisition gives the company access to the African countries of: South Africa, Botswana, Ghana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia.\n\n\nThe Massmart acquisition received final governmental approval in early 2012. The single store Mauritius was closed in January 2012.\n\n\nIn June 2014, Walmart employees went on strike in several major cities in the United States.[15]\n\n\nIn light of recent events, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, in the last eighteen months, as of July 2021; Walmart has displaced all cashiers at smaller stores and neighborhood locations. Such locations, only have Scan-and-Go self-checkout stations. Walmart Supercenter locations also will see replacement of cashiers by 2025, as mainly 25% of cashiers work in most locations, while other 75% cashier stalls are closed all day.[16]\n\n\n\n### New ventures[edit]\n\n\nIn late 2005, Walmart designed two experimental stores, one in McKinney, Texas and the other in Aurora, Colorado, which featured wind turbines, photovoltaic solar panels, biofuel-capable boilers, water-cooled refrigerators, and xeriscape gardens.[17]\n\n\nIn March 2006, Walmart sought to appeal to a more affluent demographic, with the opening of a new supercenter in Plano, Texas, at the corner of Park Blvd. and the Dallas North Tollway which was intended to compete against stores that some viewed as more upscale and appealing.[18] The new store features wooden floors, wider aisles, a sushi bar, a coffee/sandwich shop (with free Wi-Fi Internet access), a Subway, and higher-end items such as microbrew beer, expensive wines, and high-end electronics. The exterior sports the less-common hunter green background behind the Walmart letters instead of the trademark blue.\n\n\nIn response to the popularity of organic food supermarkets, such as Whole Foods and Wild Oats, Walmart announced plans in May 2006, to increase the amount of organic food available in its stores.[19] They announced that both conventionally grown and organic versions of certain products would be available, and the price of organic versions would not be more than 10% over the price of conventionally grown products.[19] Since Walmart is one of the nation's largest grocery retailers, there was some concern expressed that their push to lower prices would not be sustainable for inexpensive organic food.[20]\n\n\n\n### Legal trouble[edit]\n\n\nOver the last decade or so Walmart has become involved in numerous lawsuits for a variety of reasons. The majority of the suits are class action lawsuits in which employees are suing for unpaid wages.[21] They have also run into numerous discrimination cases in which employees are suing for being profiled out of money or out of jobs. For example, there were two separate cases, one in 2004 and one in 2005, in which black employees were suing two different Walmarts for denying them jobs based on race.[22] These became so popular that the Reverend Jesse Jackson intervened and spoke during both of the proceedings. There are also many lawsuits in which women are suing Wal-Mart for discriminating against them. In one article written in 2004 USA today mentioned 32 different lawsuits that involved women suing Walmart. But still Walmart has prevailed.[23] All of this has not had any effects on Walmart financially however, according to Fortune 500, Walmart still had $351 billion (~$497\u00a0billion in 2023) in revenue ($11 billion in profit) in 2007, a new high for the corporation.[24]\n\n\nOn December 3, 2008, the family of Walmart service worker Jdimytai Damour, who was killed by a stampede of shoppers frantically entering a Walmart store in Valley Stream, New York, on Black Friday (November 28),[25] filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the corporation; Damour's family alleged Walmart of encouraging a mass number of customers to come to the store simultaneously.[26] In addition, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration cited Walmart for \"...inadequate crowd management following the Nov. 28, 2008, death of an employee at its Valley Stream, New York, store. The worker died of asphyxiation after being knocked to the ground and trampled by a crowd of about 2,000 shoppers who surged into the store for its annual 'Blitz Friday' pre-holiday sales event.\"\n[27] The company went on to spend an estimated $2 million in legal fees fighting OSHA's $7,000 fine, because it apparently wished to prevent OSHA from establishing a precedent that would enable OSHA to influence Walmart's crowd control measures in the future.[28]\n\n\n\n### Countries of operation[edit]\n\n\nAs of 2022[update], Walmart stores operate in Botswana, Canada, Chile, China, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Ghana, Guatemala, Honduras, India, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mexico, Mozambique, Namibia, Nicaragua, Nigeria, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, the United States (including Puerto Rico) and Zambia.[29][30]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Criticism of Walmart\n* List of Walmart brands\n* List of assets owned by Walmart\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Vance H.

It has been referred to as \"one of the most influential economic and cultural forces in the world\",[1] and is one of the world's most valuable brands.[2]\n\n\nAmazon was founded by Jeff Bezos from his garage in Bellevue, Washington,[3] on July 5, 1994. Initially an online marketplace for books, it has expanded into a multitude of product categories: a strategy that has earned it the moniker The Everything Store.[4] It has multiple subsidiaries including Amazon Web Services (cloud computing), Zoox (autonomous vehicles), Kuiper Systems (satellite Internet), Amazon Lab126 (computer hardware R&D). Its other subsidiaries include Ring, Twitch, IMDb, MGM Holdings and Whole Foods Market.\n\n\n\n\n## Founding[edit]\n\n\nThe company was created as a result of what Jeff Bezos called his \"regret minimization framework\" \u2013 to avoid regretting, in his old age, not having tried to participate in the emerging internet with his own startup.[5] In 1994, Bezos left his job as a vice president at D. E. Shaw & Co., a Wall Street firm, and moved to Seattle, Washington, where he began to work on a business plan[6] for what would become Amazon.com.\n\n\nOn July 5, 1994, Bezos initially incorporated the company in Washington state with the name Cadabra, Inc.[7] After a few months, he changed the name to Amazon.com, Inc, because a lawyer misheard its original name as \"cadaver\".[8] Bezos selected this name by looking through a dictionary; he settled on \"Amazon\" because it was a place that was \"exotic and different\", just as he had envisioned for his Internet enterprise. The Amazon River, he noted, was the biggest river in the world, and he planned to make his store the biggest bookstore in the world.[9] Additionally, a name that began with \"A\" was preferred because it would probably be at the top of an alphabetized list.[9] Bezos placed a premium on his head start in building a brand and told a reporter, \"There's nothing about our model that can't be copied over time. But you know, McDonald's got copied. And it's still built a huge, multibillion-dollar company. A lot of it comes down to the brand name. Brand names are more important online than they are in the physical world.\"[10]\n\n\nIn its early days, the company was operated out of the garage of Bezos's house on Northeast 28th Street in Bellevue, Washington.[11]\n\n\n\n## Online bookstore and IPO[edit]\n\n\nAfter reading a report about the future of the Internet that projected annual web commerce growth at 2,300%, Bezos created a list of 20 products that could be marketed online. He narrowed the list to what he felt were the five most promising products, which included: compact discs, computer hardware, computer software, videos, and books. Bezos finally decided that his new business would sell books online, because of the large worldwide demand for literature, the low unit price for books, and the huge number of titles available in print.[12] Amazon was founded in the garage of Bezos' rented home in Bellevue, Washington.[9][13][14] Bezos' parents invested almost $250,000 in the start-up.[15]\n\n\nOn July 16, 1995, Amazon opened as an online bookseller, selling the world's largest collection of books to anyone with World Wide Web access.[16] The first book sold on Amazon.com was Douglas Hofstadter's *Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies: Computer Models of the Fundamental Mechanisms of Thought*.[17] In the first two months of business, Amazon sold to all 50 states and over 45 countries. Within two months, Amazon's sales were up to $20,000 per week.[18] In October 1995, the company announced itself to the public.[19] In 1996, it was reincorporated in Delaware. Amazon issued its initial public offering of capital stock on May 15, 1997, at $18 per share, trading under the NASDAQ stock exchange symbol AMZN.[20]\n\n\nBarnes & Noble sued Amazon on May 12, 1997, alleging that Amazon's claim to be \"the world's largest bookstore\" was false because it \"...wasn't a bookstore at all. It's a book broker.\" The suit was later settled out of court and Amazon continued to make the same claim.[21] Walmart sued Amazon on October 16, 1998, alleging that Amazon had stolen Walmart's trade secrets by hiring former Walmart executives. Although this suit was also settled out of court, it caused Amazon to implement internal restrictions and the reassignment of the former Walmart executives.[21]\n\n\nIn 1999, Amazon first attempted to enter the publishing business by buying a defunct imprint, \"Weathervane\", and publishing some books \"selected with no apparent thought\", according to *The New Yorker*. The imprint quickly vanished again, and as of 2014[update] Amazon representatives said that they had never heard of it.[22] Also in 1999, *Time* magazine named Bezos the Person of the Year when it recognized the company's success in popularizing online shopping.[23]\n\n\n\n![](image)Amazon Toys Team employees circa 2000 during a summer Amazon party. Jeff Bezos is wearing the black shirt.\n## 2000s[edit]\n\n\nSince June 19, 2000, Amazon's logotype has featured a curved arrow leading from A to Z, representing that the company carries every product from A to Z, with the arrow shaped like a smile.[24]\n\n\nAccording to sources, Amazon did not expect to make a profit for four to five years. This comparatively slow growth caused stockholders to complain that the company was not reaching profitability fast enough to justify their investment or even survive in the long term. In 2001, the dot-com bubble burst destroyed many e-companies in the process, but Amazon survived and moved forward beyond the tech crash to become a huge player in online sales. The company finally turned its first profit in the fourth quarter of 2001: $0.01 (i.e., 1\u00a2 per share), on revenues of more than $1 billion. This profit margin, though extremely modest, proved to skeptics that Bezos' unconventional business model could succeed.[25][26]\n\n\n\n## 2010s to present[edit]\n\n\nIn 2011, Amazon had 30,000 full-time employees in the US, and by the end of 2016, it had 180,000 employees.[27]\n\n\nIn 2014, Amazon launched the Fire Phone. The Fire Phone was meant to deliver media streaming options but the venture failed, resulting in Amazon registering a $170 million loss. This would also lead to the Fire Phone production being stopped the following year. In August of the same year, Amazon would finalize the acquisition of Twitch, a social video gaming streaming site, for $970 million. This new acquisition would be integrated into the game production division of Amazon.\n\n\n\n![](image)Day 1 building in Seattle\nIn June 2017, Amazon announced that it would acquire Whole Foods, a high-end supermarket chain with over 400 stores, for $13.4 billion.[28][29] The acquisition was seen by media experts as a move to strengthen its physical holdings and challenge Walmart's supremacy as a brick and mortar retailer. This sentiment was heightened by the fact that the announcement coincided with Walmart's purchase of men's apparel company Bonobos.[30] On August 23, 2017, Whole Foods shareholders, as well as the Federal Trade Commission, approved the deal.[31][32]\n\n\nIn September 2016, Amazon announced plans to locate a second headquarters in a metropolitan area with at least a million people.[33] Cities needed to submit their presentations by October 19, 2017, for the project called HQ2.[34] The $5 billion second headquarters, starting with 500,000 square feet and eventually expanding to as much as 8 million square feet, may have as many as 50,000 employees.[35] In 2017, Amazon announced it would build a new downtown Seattle building with space for Mary's Place, a local charity in 2020.[36]\n\n\nAs 2017 came to a close, Amazon had over 566,000 employees worldwide.[37][38]\n\n\nAccording to an August 8, 2018, story in Bloomberg Businessweek, Amazon has about a 5 percent share of US retail spending (excluding cars and car parts and visits to restaurants and bars), and a 43.5 percent share of American online spending in 2018. The forecast is for Amazon to own 49 percent of the total American online spending in 2018, with two-thirds of Amazon's revenue coming from the US.[39]\n\n\nAmazon launched the last-mile delivery program and ordered 20,000 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter Vans for the service in September 2018.[40][41]\n\n\nAmazon generated $386 billion in US retail e-commerce sales in 2020, up 38% over 2019. Amazon's Marketplace sales represent an increasingly dominant portion of its e-commerce business.\n\n\nOn November 14, 2022, it was announced that Amazon had plans to lay off 10,000 employees among its corporate and technology staff.[42] The number increased to 18,000 in a January 2023 announcement.[43] In March, Amazon announced it would eliminate an additional 9,000 jobs.[44]\n\n\nOn September 25, 2023, Amazon and artificial intelligence startup Anthropic announced a strategic partnership in which Amazon would become a minority stakeholder by investing up to US$4 billion, including an immediate investment of $1.25bn. As part of the deal, Anthropic would use Amazon Web Services (AWS) as its primary cloud provider and will make its AI models available to AWS customers.[45][46]\n\n\nWith more than one million workers employed in warehouses around the world, Amazon in 2023 started testing humanoid robots that provide partial automation of its work tasks.[47] The robots are able to position empty boxes and indicate where new ones are stored. [48]\n\n\n\n### HQ2[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2018, Amazon [49] announced it would open its highly sought-after new headquarters, known as (HQ2) in Long Island City, Queens, New York City,[50][51] and in the Crystal City neighborhood of Arlington, Virginia.[52] On February 14, 2019, Amazon announced it was not moving forward with plans to build HQ2 in Queens[53] but would instead focus solely on the Arlington location. The company plans to locate at least 25,000 employees at HQ2 by 2030 and will invest more than US$2.5 billion[54] to establish its new headquarters in Crystal City as well as neighboring Pentagon City and Potomac Yard, an area jointly marketed as \"National Landing.\" The announcement also created a new partnership with Virginia Tech University to develop an Innovation Campus to fill the demand for high-tech talent in National Landing and beyond.\n\n\n\n### COVID-19[edit]\n\n\nAt the end of March 2020, some workers of the Staten Island warehouse staged a walkout in protest of the poor health situation at their workplace amidst the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. One of the organizers, Chris Smalls, was first put on quarantine without anyone else being quarantined, and soon afterwards fired from the company.[55][56][57][58][59]\n\n\nThe pandemic caused a surge in online shopping and resulted in shortages of household staples both online and in some brick-and-mortar stores. From March 17[60] to April 10, 2020,[61] Amazon warehouses stopped accepting non-essential items from third-party sellers. The company hired approximately 175,000 additional warehouse workers and delivery contractors to deal with the surge, and temporarily raised wages by $2/hour.[61]\n\n\n\n### Acquisition of MGM[edit]\n\n\nAfter months of speculation due to MGM's poor financial performance from the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on the movie industry, Amazon entered negotiations to acquire MGM at an estimated $9 billion on May 17, 2021.[62] The companies agreed to the merger deal on May 26, 2021, for a total value of $8.45 billion, subject to regulatory approval. The deal would allow Amazon to add the MGM library to the Amazon Prime Video catalog, with the studio continuing to operate as a label under the new parent company.[63] The merger was finalized on March 17, 2022, following the expiration of the FTC's review deadline[64] and having cleared the European Commission two days earlier on March 15.[65][66][67][68][69][70][71] Later that day, Amazon Studios and Prime Video SVP Mike Hopkins revealed that Amazon will continue to partner with United Artists Releasing (MGM and Annapurna Pictures' joint distribution venture), which will remain in operation to release all future MGM titles theatrically on a \"case-by-case basis,\" while \"all MGM employees will join my organization.\" It was also revealed that Amazon had no plans to make changes to the studio's production slate and release schedules nor make all MGM content exclusive to Prime Video, providing some hope that the studio would operate autonomously from Amazon Studios. These plans are expected to not impact the future of the James Bond franchise and its creative team. Two town halls further detailing MGM's future post-merger took place on March 18, 2022, which included one for MGM employees and one for Amazon Studios/Prime Video employees.[72] Both revealed the new interim reporting structure as part of Amazon's \"phased integration plan,\" which would involve De Luca, Mark Burnett (Chairman of MGM Worldwide Television) and COO Chris Brearton reporting to Hopkins on behalf of the studio.[73] On April 27, 2022, it was announced that De Luca and Abdy would leave the studio.[74]\n\n\n\n## Amazon Go[edit]\n\n\nOn January 22, 2018, Amazon Go, a store that uses cameras and sensors to detect items that a shopper grabs off shelves and automatically charges a shopper's Amazon account, was opened to the general public in Seattle.[75][76] Customers scan their Amazon Go app as they enter, and are required to have an Amazon Go app installed on their smartphone and a linked Amazon account to be able to enter.[75] The technology is meant to eliminate the need for checkout lines.[77][78][79] Amazon Go was initially opened for Amazon employees in December 2016.[80][81][82] By the end of 2018, there will be 8 total Amazon Go stores located in Seattle, Chicago, San Francisco and New York.[83]\n\n\n\n## Amazon 4-Star[edit]\n\n\nAmazon announced to debut the Amazon 4-star in New York, Soho neighborhood Spring Street between Crosby and Lafayette on 27 September 2018. The store carries 4-star and above-rated products from around New York.[84] The Amazon website searches for the most rated, highly demanded, frequently bought, and most wished for products which are then sold in the new Amazon store under separate categories. Along with the paper price tags, the online review cards will also be available for the customers to read before buying the product.[85][86] In late 2021, Amazon opened two 4-star stores in the United Kingdom. Its store at the Bluewater Shopping Centre in Kent opened in October, and its store at Westfield London opened in November.[87]\n\n\nIn March 2022, Amazon announced that they would be closing all 4-star stores, along with their Books and Pop Up stores, across the US and the UK, stating that they were refocusing on their grocery and fashion stores.[88]\n\n\n\n## Mergers and acquisitions[edit]\n\n\nAmazon has grown through several mergers and acquisitions. The company has also invested in a number of growing firms, both in the United States and internationally.[89][90] In 2014, Amazon purchased top level domain .buy in auction for over $4 million.[91][92] The company has invested in brands that offer a wide range of services and products, including Engine Yard, a Ruby-on-Rails platform as a service company,[93] and Living Social, a local deal site.[94]\n\n\n\n## Timeline[edit]\n\n\n### Overview[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Time period | Key developments at Amazon\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1994\u20131998 | Amazon started off as an online bookstore selling books, primarily competing with local booksellers and Barnes & Noble.

Their legal status varies from being a part of government to stock companies with a state as a regular or dominant stockholder. There is no standard definition of a government-owned corporation (GOC) or state-owned enterprise (SOE), although the two terms are often used interchangeably. The defining characteristics are that they have a distinct legal shape and they are established to operate in commercial affairs.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe role of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in SOEs has varied at different periods but has increased during the Xi Jinping administration, with the CCP formally taking a commanding role in all SOEs as of 2020.[1][2] For example, Lai Xiaomin, the former president of state-owned China Huarong Asset Management announced in 2015 that during the operation of China Huarong Asset Management, the embedded CCP committee will play a central role, and party members will play an exemplary role.[3] As Jin et al wrote in 2022,[4]\n\n\n\n\n> The overarching principle of SOE reform is to firmly implement the Party\u2019s leadership and the modern enterprise system. This principle creates a political governance system in China\u2019s SOEs\u2014a Party-dominated governance system characterized by Party leadership, state ownership, Party cadre management, Party participation in corporate decision-making, and intra-Party supervision.\n> \n> \n\nCCP branches within China's SOEs are the governing bodies which make important decisions and inculcate its ideology.[5]:\u200a14\n\n\n\n## Significance[edit]\n\n\nWhen China's SOEs were first created, they served as instruments for carrying out national goals and providing social stability via the iron rice bowl.[6]:\u200a84 Financial performance of SOEs was not a major concern until China's reform era.[6]:\u200a84\u201385\n\n\nAs of 2017[update], China has more SOEs than any other country, and the most SOEs among large national companies.[7] In 2018, half of the country's centrally-owned SOEs were among the world's 500 largest companies.[6]:\u200a95 As of the end of 2019, China's SOEs represented 4.5% of the global economy[8][*needs update*] and the total assets of all China's SOEs, including those operating in the financial sector, reached US$78.08\u00a0trillion.[9][*needs update*]\n\n\nState-owned enterprises accounted for over 60% of China's market capitalization in 2019[10] and generated 40% of China's GDP of US$15.97\u00a0trillion (101.36 trillion yuan) in 2020, with domestic and foreign private businesses and investment accounting for the remaining 60%.[11][12] Ninety-one (91) of these SOEs belong to the 2020 Fortune Global 500 companies.[13][*needs update*]\n\n\nSOEs have a primary role in China's energy sector.[14]:\u200a24 Its five large state-owned power generation companies are: Datang, Guodian, Huadian, Huaneng, and China Power Investment Corporation.[14]:\u200a40 Its state-owned grid companies are State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC) and China Southern Power Grid Corporation.[14]:\u200a41\n\n\nMost Chinese universities are SOEs.[14]:\u200a217\n\n\nChina's SOEs are at the forefront of global seaport construction, and most new ports built by them are part of the Belt and Road Initiative.[15] State-owned banks are important sources of funding for port construction.[16]:\u200a272\n\n\nIn addition to their own operations, SOEs invest in private enterprises.[5]:\u200a217\u2013218 From the perspective of these private enterprises, this form of partial state ownership is helpful in obtaining financing from banks, particularly as prompts banks to require less collateral.[5]:\u200a21 Sometimes in investing in private enterprises, SOEs acquire enough shares to nationalize them.[5]:\u200a218 Over the period 2018-2020, 109 publicly traded enterprises with more than $100 billion in collective total assets were nationalized in this way.[5]:\u200a218\n\n\nAccording to academic Wendy Leutert, China's SOEs, \"...contribute to central and local governments revenues through dividends and taxes, support urban employment, keep key input prices low, channel capital towards targeted industries and technologies, support sub-national redistribution to poorer interior and western provinces, and aid the state's response to natural disasters, financial crises and social instability.\"[7]:\u200a146\n\n\n\n## History of SOEs[edit]\n\n\nFollowing the CCP victory in the Chinese Civil War, one of the party's early steps was to nationalize enterprises that the defeated Nationalists had controlled.[17]:\u200a36 By 1952, China's SOEs accounted for more than 40% of industrial production, and by 1956 nearly all large-scale commerce and industry had been nationalized.[17]:\u200a36\n\n\nDuring the Third Front campaign to develop heavy industry in China's interior regions, almost 400 state-owned enterprises were re-located from coastal cities to secret sites in the Chinese interior where they would be more protected in event of foreign invasion.[18]:\u200a3\n\n\nIn 1984, the State Council issued a directive to expand the autonomy of SOEs.[19]:\u200a81 SOEs were also allowed to sell surplus goods on the market once they had met their quotas.[19]:\u200a81\n\n\nWith the goal of boosting innovation and efficiency, more than half of China's largest SOEs had established technical development centers by 1993.[14]:\u200a24 The same year, the CCP issued its \"Decision on Issues Related to the Establishment of a Socialist Market Economy System.\"[20]:\u200a215 In the wave of reform thereafter, one goal was to separate SOE management from government and to empower a select group of SOEs with special property rights and autonomy.[20]:\u200a215\n\n\nConsistent with President Jiang Zemin and Premier Zhu Rongji's strategy of \"grasping the large, letting go of the small,\" major SOE reform occurred in 1997,[20]:\u200a215 which represented a change from the previously incremental reform efforts.[21]:\u200a96 The state was encouraged to preserve large SOEs and to allow weaker ones to be \"let go\" through closing or consolidating.[20]:\u200a215\u2013216 Other major policies that were part of the 1997 reforms included management and employee buyouts and the inclusion of foreign strategic partners.[21]:\u200a96\n\n\nSOE mergers have been routine since 2000.[7]:\u200a140 Beginning in 2003 with Hu Jintao's administration, the Chinese government increasingly funded SOE consolidation, supplying massive subsidies and favoring SOEs from a regulatory standpoint.[5]:\u200a217 These efforts helped SOEs to crowd out foreign and domestic private sector competitors.[5]:\u200a217\n\n\nAs part of China's Great Western Development program, China's five large state-owned hydropower companies planned, underwrote, and built the majority of dams on the river and its tributaries.[22]:\u200a220\n\n\nSOEs were major beneficiaries of China's stimulus program following the 2008 global financial crisis, which began a period where the private sector withdrew and the state-owned sector expanded.[5]:\u200a216\n\n\n\n### Under Xi Jinping[edit]\n\n\nThe pace of SOE mergers has increased under Xi.[7]:\u200a140 The goals of China's current SOE mergers include an effort to create larger and more competitive national champions with a bigger global market share by reducing price competition among SOEs abroad and increasing vertical integration.[7]:\u200a140\n\n\nOverall, China's focus on SOEs during the Xi era have demonstrated a commitment to using SOEs to serve non-market objectives and increasing CCP control of SOEs[7]:\u200a138 while taking some limited steps towards market liberalization, such as increasing mixed ownership of SOEs.[7]:\u200a141 Along with increased mergers, promotion of mixed ownership, and management of state capital have continued; results have been mixed.[7]:\u200a141\n\n\nAccording to Xi, \"[T]he dominant role of state ownership cannot be changed, and the leading role of the state-economy cannot be changed.\"[5]:\u200a217 In Xi Jinping Thought, the historical importance of state-owned enterprises is highlighted:[5]:\u200a217\n\n\n\n\n> [W]ithout the important material foundation that state-owned enterprises have laid for China's development over a long period of time, without the major innovations and key core technologies achieved by state-owned enterprises, and without state-owned enterprises' long-term commitment to a large number of social responsibilities, there would be no economic independence and national security for China, no continuous improvement in people's lives, and no socialist China standing tall in the East of the world.\n> \n> \n\nXi Jinping thought also emphasizes the role of SOEs as part of the dominant position of state ownership necessary for common prosperity.[5]:\u200a223\n\n\nIn 2023, multiple state-owned enterprises, including Shanghai Municipal Investment Group, established internal People\u2019s Armed Forces departments run by the People's Liberation Army.[23][24] They are expected \"to work together with grassroots organizations to collect intelligence and information, dissolve and/or eliminate security concerns at the budding stage,\" according to the *People's Liberation Army Daily*.[24]\n\n\n\n## State Council (Central Government)[edit]\n\n\n### China Investment Corporation[edit]\n\n\n* Central Huijin

Commission \u00a7\u00a0Central SOEs.\n\nAs of 2022[update], SASAC oversees 97 centrally owned companies.[7]:\u200a137 Companies directly supervised by SASAC have been reduced and consolidated through mergers according to the state-owned enterprise restructuring plan with the number of SASAC companies down from over 150 in 2008.[25]\n\n\n\n### Ministry of Finance[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ministry

Meanwhile, he avoided laying off excess workers by shifting them to the company's Malan Noodle\u00a0[zh] restaurant chain.[5] He brought in consultants to professionalize the company's management, and it has become one of China's most dynamic state enterprises.[5]\n\n\n\n### State company[edit]\n\n\nIn May 2004, after the State Council of the People's Republic of China approved a merger of companies formerly under the Ministry of Chemical Industry as the China National Chemical Corporation (ChemChina), Ren Jianxin became its CEO; in December 2014 he became the chairman of the board of directors.[4]\n\n\nWithin ChemChina's agrochemicals business is a large portfolio of companies including Sanonda Holdings, Cangzhou Dahua, Shandong Dacheng, Jiangsu Anpon, Anhui Petrochemicals, and Huaihe Chemicals. It added Israel-based Makhteshim Agan (renamed to Adama Agricultural Solutions) in 2011 to the division in a 2.4 billion US dollars acquisition of a 60% stake in the company, the largest manufacturer of generic pesticides.[6]\n\n\nThe chemical materials and speciality chemicals group made overseas acquisitions with two deals in 2006, both to acquire French companies.[7] The first one was the Adisseo Group, a global animal nutrition feed firm that specialized in producing methionine, vitamins and biological enzymes. At the time of the purchase, Adisseo had worldwide market share of 30% in methionine.[7] The other company was the organic silicon and sulphide business of Rhodia.[7] With this acquisition the company became the third largest producer in the world of organic silicon.[7]\n\n\nThe petrochemical processing division has been operating refineries including small ones known as teapot plants, giving it an oil processing capacity of about 25\u00a0million tonnes (25,000,000 long tons; 28,000,000 short tons) a year or about 500,000 barrels per day. After regulations liberalized the import of crude and fuel products in China, the company opened a trading office in Singapore in October 2013.[8]\n\n\nIn March 2015, it was announced that Pirelli shareholders had accepted a \u20ac7.1 billion bid from ChemChina for the world's fifth-largest tyre maker.[9][10]\n\n\n\n### Syngenta acquisition[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2016, ChemChina agreed to a $43 billion bid for Swiss seeds and pesticides group Syngenta,[11] the largest ever foreign purchase by a Chinese firm.[12][11] The deal was awaiting approval by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) and European government panels, citing food safety and security concerns. In June 2016, both companies refiled the transaction for CFIUS approval, forcing them to restart the application process.[13] In August 2016, the CFIUS cleared the deal, while the merger still awaited the regulatory review and concessions made towards the European Commission,[14] in particular with regard to divesting itself from agrochemical subsidiary Adama Agricultural Solutions (which was planned to sell to ChemChina's associated company Sanonda).[15]\n\n\nThe Australian Competition & Consumer Commission cleared the deal in December 2016, but the buy-out was again delayed due to European antitrust investigations.[16] In April 2017, the European Commissioner for Competition and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission both approved the merger, requiring ChemChina to divest from pesticide production of paraquat, abamectin and chlorothalonil.[17][18] The European Commission also addressed competition concerns with regard to plant growth regulators and reiterated the expected commitments for divestment from ADAMA-related products.[19] As of May 26, 2017, ChemChina's plan to purchase Syngenta for $44 billion was nearing completion,[12] with ChemChina amassing \"huge bridge loans\" to pay Syngenta stockholders.[12] The deal was completed that same month with 82.2 percent of Syngenta shares and depository receipts offered.[15]\n\n\n\n### Sinochem merger[edit]\n\n\nIn May 2017, *Reuters*, reported that discussion had begun regarding the merging and consolidation of ChemChina and state-owned Sinochem, overtaking industry leaders such as BASF, in a deal worth around $120 billion.[20] ChemChina merged with Sinochem Group to form Sinochem Holdings Corporation Ltd in 2021. This company also belongs to the Chinese state.[21][22]\n\n\n\n### U.S. sanctions[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: United States sanctions against China\n\nIn August 2020, the United States Department of Defense published the names of companies operating directly or indirectly in the United States with ties to the People's Liberation Army. ChemChina was included on the list.[23][24] In November 2020, Donald Trump issued an executive order prohibiting any American company or individual from owning shares in companies that the United States Department of Defense has listed as having links to the People's Liberation Army, which included ChemChina.[25][26]\n\n\nIn October 2022, the United States Department of Defense added ChemChina to a list of \"Chinese military companies\" operating in the U.S.[27]\n\n\n\n## Subsidiaries[edit]\n\n\n* China National Agrochemical Corporation (100%)\n\t+ Sanonda Holdings (100%)\n\t\t- Sanonda (expected 70%)\n\t\t\t* Adama Agricultural Solutions (100%)\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** 2016\u5e74\u5e74\u5ea6\u62a5\u544a [2016 Annual Report] (in Chinese (China)).

Its registered address is China (Shanghai) Pilot Free Trade Zone and principal place of business at Unit 3101, 31/F, Tower 2, China Central Place, 79 Jianguo Road, Chaoyang District, Beijing.\"[3]\n\n\nBHR was one of twenty-five investors to take part in the capital injection of Sinopec Marketing Co. and their investment of approximately (US)$1.7bn dollars was the 7th largest of the group, giving them a 1.68% shareholding interest out of an available 29.99%. As part of the approved agreement, Sinopec retained 70.01%.[3]\n\n\nBHR was founded in 2013, by two Chinese-registered asset managers, Bohai Industrial Investment Fund and Harvest Fund Management, and two U.S. organisations, Thornton Group LLC and Rosemont Seneca Partners (thus the name BHR for the first initials of three of the four asset management founding firms).[4][5][6] The Chinese registered asset managers are BOC International Holdings-backed Bohai Industrial Investment Fund Management and Deutsche Bank-backed Harvest Fund Management.[6] The U.S. partners as a pair and the two Chinese partners each own a 30% stake in the joint management firm.[6]\n\n\nAccording to the *Wall Street Journal*, \"Bohai is China's oldest private equity firm, having launched the country's first yuan-denominated fund in 2006. Harvest Fund Management is one of China's largest asset managers, with previous private equity ventures, including with a jointly held fund investing in both domestic and overseas real estate\".[6] Thornton Group is a Boston-based cross-border investment advisory firm founded by Michael Lin and James Bulger, son of former Massachusetts state Senate President William Bulger and nephew of Whitey Bulger.[5] Rosemont Seneca is a Washington, D.C.-based investment and advisory firm, founded by Devon Archer, Christopher Heinz, and Hunter Biden, who is the son of U.S. President Joe Biden.[5][7] According to *The New Yorker*, in June 2013, \"[Jonathan] Li, Archer, and other business partners signed a memorandum of understanding to create the fund, which they named BHR Partners, and, in November, they signed contracts related to the deal. Hunter became an unpaid member of BHR\u2019s board but did not take an equity stake in BHR Partners until after his father left the White House [as U.S. Vice President]\".[7]\n\n\n\n## Fundraising[edit]\n\n\nThe firm set out in 2014 to raise $1.5 billion for investments, some in dollars and some in yuan. The yuan investments were to be converted to U.S. dollars through Shanghai Free-Trade Zone, facilitating offshore investment for Chinese investors. The website said the company has \"the support of Bank of China, China Development Bank Capital, and other major Chinese financial institutions.[4] Bohai Harvest has also partnered with a subsidiary of China's conglomerate HNA Group.[5]\n\n\n\n## Transactions[edit]\n\n\n* 2014 - Approximately RMB4 billion in the Chinese pilot State-Owned Enterprises reform deal \"involving the segregation and capitalization of Sinopec Group\u2019s non-oil business into Sinopec Marketing Corporation\";\n* 2015 - Henniges Automotive[8] with strategic partner, AVIC Auto;[9][10][11] total transaction valued at around US$600 million; Reuters reported that the \"deal was subject to review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), and last month Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley raised concern about the CFIUS process, citing potential conflicts of interest.\"[11][12]\n* Investments in 3Bio Inc., and Didi Taxi.[13][11]\n* In November, 2016, BHR agreed to purchase Lundin Mining Corp's minority stake in African copper mine Tenke Fungurume Mining S.A. for $1.14 billion in cash. Lundin held a 30% interest in TF Holdings, a holding company, and an effective 24% stake in the mining operation. Freeport-McMoRan Inc. currently owns the remaining 70% stake in TF Holdings (an effective 56% of the mine), but is in the process of selling its stake to China Molybdenum Co. for a reported $2.65 billion. The Democratic Republic of the Congo, where the Tenke mine is located, owns the remaining 20% of the mine.[14] According to Oxfam, \"the Government of DRC knew nothing about [transaction] until after it happened.\"[15]\n* In 2017, BHR invested in a Chinese technology company Megvii.[16][5]\n\n\n## Controversy[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2021, the *New York Times* reported that BHR Partners helped finance a coal-mining company in Australia that was controlled by a Chinese state-owned enterprise, as well as assisted a subsidiary of a Chinese defense company in acquiring an auto parts manufacturer in Michigan. It also reported in detail how BHR, whose founding board members included Hunter Biden, son of U.S. President Joe Biden, facilitated the purchase of Tenke Fungurume Mine, one of the world's richest cobalt mines in a US$3.8 billion deal in the Democratic Republic of the Congo by China Molybdenum, a Chinese state-owned mining company. The competition between China and the US in securing cobalt, a raw material used in electric vehicles, has become a point of contention in recent years.[17] The deal has drawn criticism from a variety of sources for the possible involvement of Hunter Biden, including his continued 10% ownership stake in BHR, although a former BHR board member told the *Times* that Biden and the other American BHR founders were not involved in the mine deal.[18][19]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Explainer: Trump's claims and Hunter Biden's dealings in China\". *Reuters*. 3 October 2019.\n2. **^** \"Hunter Biden's China firm is small fish in China's private equity pond\". *South China Morning Post*. 14 October 2019.\n3. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** \"China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation Foreign Issuer Report 6-K\". *U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission*.
