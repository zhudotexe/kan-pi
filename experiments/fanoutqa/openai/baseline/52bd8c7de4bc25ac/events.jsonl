The successor to macOS Big Sur, it was announced at WWDC 2021 on June 7, 2021,[3][4][5][6] and released on October 25, 2021.[7][8] macOS Monterey was succeeded by macOS Ventura, which was released on October 24, 2022.\n\n\nThe operating system is named after Monterey Bay, continuing the trend of releases named after California locations since 2013's 10.9 Mavericks.\n\n\nmacOS Monterey is the final version of macOS that supports the 2015–2017 MacBook Air, Retina MacBook Pro, 2014 Mac Mini and cylindrical Mac Pro, as its successor, macOS Ventura, drops support for those models.\n\n\n\n\n## Changes[edit]\n\n\nMonterey introduced several new features and changes, including the following:[3]\n\n\n\n* Shortcuts for the Mac\n* TestFlight for the Mac\n* Provisions to allow the planned introduction of Universal Control,[9] which allows a single keyboard and mouse to control multiple Macs and iPads. It works on Macs with Apple silicon and some with an Intel processor, including MacBook Pro (2016 and later), MacBook (2016 and later), MacBook Air (2018 and later), iMac (2017 and later), iMac (5K Retina, 27-inch, Late 2015), iMac Pro, Mac Mini (2018 and later), and Mac Pro (2019). It works on these iPads: iPad Pro, iPad Air (3rd generation and later), iPad (6th generation and later), and iPad Mini (5th generation and later).\n* Support for the Apple Music Voice Plan Subscription.\n* Portrait Mode and Noise Cancellation features for FaceTime and some apps (in Control Center).\n* New Toolbar features and designs for Finder and the Preview app.\n* Have a Live Memoji and Animoji right on the lock screen.\n* A yellow privacy indicator on the menu bar for indicating if the Mac's microphone or camera is active.\n* Live Text, which allows a user to copy, paste, translate and look up text from images displayed by Photos, Screenshot, Quick Look, and Safari.\n* New Passwords Manager for Mac\n* New on-device machine-learning–activated keyboard dictation using Siri, and also now for almost unlimited duration.\n* Low Power Mode for Mac that enables longer battery life for lightweight workflows such as reading PDFs, Web browsing, listening to music, etc. This works on MacBook Air (2018 and later) and MacBook Pro (2016 and later).[10]\n* A redesigned optional compact interface for the Safari browser.\n* Support for playing AirPlay content streamed from recent iOS and iPadOS devices and Macs, including MacBook Pro (2018 and later), MacBook Air (2018 and later), iMac (2019 and later), iMac Pro (2017), Mac Mini (M1, 2020 and later), Mac Pro (2019), iPhone 6s and later, iPad Pro (2nd generation and later), iPad Air (3rd generation and later), iPad (6th generation and later), and iPad Mini (5th generation and later). Older iPhone, iPad, and Mac models may share content at a lower resolution to supported Mac models when \"Allow AirPlay for\" is set to \"Everyone\" or \"Anyone on the same network\" in Sharing preferences.\n* Improvements to FaceTime, including the ability to share a screen and the SharePlay function that enables multiple users to watch or listen simultaneously and in sync (e.g., to music or TV shows).\n* The ability to factory reset the Mac from the System Preferences app.[11]\n* Visual Look Up makes it easy to identify objects (e.g. cat breeds, dog breeds, etc.) found within user's photos.\n* Focus to set different modes to filter notifications across iPhones, iPads and Macs.\n* The Time Machine backup functionality excludes more system files.[12]\n* Provisions to allow the planned introduction of \"Expanded Protections for Children,\" which will apply cryptography to detect and help limit the spread of child sexual abuse material (CSAM) online by scanning the user's iCloud photos.[13]\n* Accessibility option to change the mouse pointer's colors.\n* Tips notifications.\n* The removal of a previously bundled PHP interpreter.[14]\n* The removal of a previously bundled Python 2.7 interpreter (from 12.3)[15][16]\n* The removal of the ability to use custom Quartz Composer filters and plugins in Photo Booth.\n* networkQuality, a command-line tool for measuring upload/download capacity, upload/download flows, and upload/download responsiveness\n* An automatically populated \"Games\" folder within launchpad\n* Support for ProMotion in new 2021 MacBook Pro\n* New Object Capture API for creating 3D models using images[17]\n\n\n### Applications[edit]\n\n\n#### Notes[edit]\n\n\nIn the Notes application, users can now apply arbitrary tags to a note (e.g., #cooking, #work); groups of notes with a given tag or tags can be viewed in Smart Folders or a Tag Browser in the sidebar.[18] The new Quick Notes function enables a user to create a note from within any app via system-wide keyboard shortcut or hot corner.[19]\n\n\n\n#### Maps[edit]\n\n\nApple Maps adds a 3D globe, with increased mountain, desert, and forest detail.[20]\n\n\n\n#### Messages[edit]\n\n\nMessages supports new features, also introduced in iOS 15, such as \"Shared with You\" which provides shortcut links to content shared via Messages in other Apple apps such as Safari, Photos, Music, and News.\n\n\nWhen multiple photos are sent/received, they are now displayed as a collection instead of multiple messages. A download button is provided to download all photos simultaneously.[21]\n\n\n\n## Known problems[edit]\n\n\nUsers and developers have reported the following:\n\n\n\n* Laptops unable to boot (fixed with 12.0.1 update)[22][23]\n* Inability to charge sleeping laptops with MagSafe (fixed with 12.1 update)[24]\n* Mouse pointer memory leak issue (fixed with 12.1 update)[25]\n* Audio issue with speaker and audio output crackling and popping[26]\n* Problems connecting external displays to Mac using any version of Monterey[27]\n* Unicode Hex Input does not work if the code point number is 0xx0 (first and last digits are zero)[28] (fixed in Ventura 13.3)\n\n\n## Supported hardware[edit]\n\n\nSee Apple's official list on their website\n\nmacOS Monterey drops support for various Macs released from 2013 to 2015,[29][30] including all Macs with Nvidia GPUs. When Monterey was released, it supported the following Macs:\n\n\n\n* iMac (Late 2015 or later)\n* iMac Pro (2017)\n* MacBook (Early 2016 or later)\n* MacBook Air (Early 2015 or later)\n* MacBook Pro (Early 2015 or later)\n* Mac Mini (Late 2014 or later)\n* Mac Pro (Late 2013 or later)\n* Mac Studio (2022)\n\n\nBy using patch tools, macOS Monterey can be installed on earlier computers that are officially unsupported, such as the 2014 iMac and the 2013 MacBook Pro.[31] Using these methods, it is possible to install macOS Monterey on computers as old as a 2008 MacBook Pro and iMac and 2009 Mac Mini.[32]\n\n\n\n## Release history[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Previous release\n |  | Current release\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Version\n | Build\n | Release date\n | Darwin version\n | Release notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 12.0[a] | 21A344\n | October 25, 2021\n | 21.0.1xnu-8019.30.61~4Tue Sep 14 20:56:24 PDT 2021 | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 12.0.1[b] | 21A559\n | 21.1.0xnu-8019.41.5~1Wed Oct 13 17:33:23 PDT 2021 |\n| 12.1\n | 21C52\n | December 13, 2021\n | 21.2.0xnu-8019.61.5~1Sun Nov 28 20:28:54 PST 2021 | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 12.2\n | 21D49\n | January 26, 2022\n | 21.3.0xnu-8019.80.24~20Wed Jan 5 21:37:58 PST 2022 | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 12.2.1\n | 21D62\n | February 10, 2022\n | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 12.3\n | 21E230\n | March 14, 2022\n | 21.4.0xnu-8020.101.4~2Mon Feb 21 20:34:37 PST 2022 | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 12.3.1\n | 21E258\n | March 31, 2022\n | 21.4.0xnu-8020.101.4~15Fri Mar 18 00:45:05 PDT 2022 | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 12.4\n | 21F79[c] | May 16, 2022\n | 21.5.0xnu-8020.121.3~4Tue Apr 26 21:08:22 PDT 2022 | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 21F2081[d] | June 14, 2022\n |\n| 21F2092[e] | June 16, 2022\n |\n| 12.5\n | 21G72\n | July 20, 2022\n | 21.6.0xnu-8020.140.41~1Sat Jun 18 17:07:22 PDT 2022 | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 12.5.1\n | 21G83\n | August 17, 2022\n | 21.6.0xnu-8020.141.5~2Wed Aug 10 14:25:27 PDT 2022 | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 12.6\n | 21G115\n | September 12, 2022\n | 21.6.0xnu-8020.140.49~2Mon Aug 22 20:17:10 PDT 2022 | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 12.6.1\n | 21G217\n | October 24, 2022\n | 21.6.0xnu-8020.240.7~1Thu Sep 29 20:12:57 PDT 2022 | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 12.6.2\n | 21G320\n | December 13, 2022\n | 21.6.0xnu-8020.240.14~1Sun Nov 6 23:31:16 PST 2022 | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 12.6.3\n | 21G419\n | January 23, 2023\n | 21.6.0xnu-8020.240.18~2Mon Dec 19 20:44:01 PST 2022 | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 12.6.4\n | 21G526\n | March 27, 2023\n | 21.6.0xnu-8020.240.18.700.8~1Thu Mar 9 20:08:59 PST 2023 | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 12.6.5\n | 21G531\n | April 10, 2023\n | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 12.6.6\n | 21G646\n | May 18, 2023\n | 21.6.0xnu-8020.240.18.701.5~1Mon Apr 24 21:10:53 PDT 2023 | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 12.6.7\n | 21G651\n | June 21, 2023\n | 21.6.0xnu-8020.240.18.701.6~1Thu Jun 8 23:57:12 PDT 2023 | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 12.6.8\n | 21G725\n | July 24, 2023\n | 21.6.0xnu-8020.240.18.702.13~1Thu Jul 6 22:18:26 PDT 2023 | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 12.6.9\n | 21G726\n | September 11, 2023\n | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 12.7\n | 21G816\n | September 21, 2023\n | 21.6.0xnu-8020.240.18.703.5~1Fri Sep 15 16:17:23 PDT 2023 | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 12.7.1\n | 21G920\n | October 25, 2023\n | 21.6.0xnu-8020.240.18.704.15~1Wed Oct 4 23:55:28 PDT 2023 | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n\n\n*See Apple's main pages for Monterey release notes: for consumers and for enterprise, as well as their current security content page.*\n\n\n\n1. **^** Preinstalled on 2021 MacBook Pros\n2. **^** Initial public release\n3. **^** Public release\n4. **^** Preinstalled on 2022 M2 MacBook Air & 13″ Pro\n5. **^** Update for 2022 M2 MacBook Air & 13″ Pro\n\n## Timeline of Mac operating systems[edit]\n\n\n| Timeline of Mac operating systems * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)\n |\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Clover, Juli (October 25, 2021). \"Apple Releases macOS Monterey With AirPlay to Mac, Live Text, Safari Updates, Shortcuts App and More\". *MacRumors*.

The successor to macOS Big Sur, it was announced at WWDC 2021 on June 7, 2021,[3][4][5][6] and released on October 25, 2021.[7][8] macOS Monterey was succeeded by macOS Ventura, which was released on October 24, 2022.\n\n\nThe operating system is named after Monterey Bay, continuing the trend of releases named after California locations since 2013's 10.9 Mavericks.\n\n\nmacOS Monterey is the final version of macOS that supports the 2015–2017 MacBook Air, Retina MacBook Pro, 2014 Mac Mini and cylindrical Mac Pro, as its successor, macOS Ventura, drops support for those models.\n\n\n\n\n## Changes[edit]\n\n\nMonterey introduced several new features and changes, including the following:[3]\n\n\n\n* Shortcuts for the Mac\n* TestFlight for the Mac\n* Provisions to allow the planned introduction of Universal Control,[9] which allows a single keyboard and mouse to control multiple Macs and iPads. It works on Macs with Apple silicon and some with an Intel processor, including MacBook Pro (2016 and later), MacBook (2016 and later), MacBook Air (2018 and later), iMac (2017 and later), iMac (5K Retina, 27-inch, Late 2015), iMac Pro, Mac Mini (2018 and later), and Mac Pro (2019). It works on these iPads: iPad Pro, iPad Air (3rd generation and later), iPad (6th generation and later), and iPad Mini (5th generation and later).\n* Support for the Apple Music Voice Plan Subscription.\n* Portrait Mode and Noise Cancellation features for FaceTime and some apps (in Control Center).\n* New Toolbar features and designs for Finder and the Preview app.\n* Have a Live Memoji and Animoji right on the lock screen.\n* A yellow privacy indicator on the menu bar for indicating if the Mac's microphone or camera is active.\n* Live Text, which allows a user to copy, paste, translate and look up text from images displayed by Photos, Screenshot, Quick Look, and Safari.\n* New Passwords Manager for Mac\n* New on-device machine-learning–activated keyboard dictation using Siri, and also now for almost unlimited duration.\n* Low Power Mode for Mac that enables longer battery life for lightweight workflows such as reading PDFs, Web browsing, listening to music, etc. This works on MacBook Air (2018 and later) and MacBook Pro (2016 and later).[10]\n* A redesigned optional compact interface for the Safari browser.\n* Support for playing AirPlay content streamed from recent iOS and iPadOS devices and Macs, including MacBook Pro (2018 and later), MacBook Air (2018 and later), iMac (2019 and later), iMac Pro (2017), Mac Mini (M1, 2020 and later), Mac Pro (2019), iPhone 6s and later, iPad Pro (2nd generation and later), iPad Air (3rd generation and later), iPad (6th generation and later), and iPad Mini (5th generation and later).

It was announced at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on June 22, 2020,[4] and was released to the public on November 12, 2020.[5][4][6]\n\n\nBig Sur is the successor to macOS Catalina, and was succeeded by macOS Monterey, which was released on October 25, 2021. The release of Big Sur was the first time the major version number of the operating system had been incremented since the Mac OS X Public Beta in 2000.\n\n\nFor the first time since OS X Yosemite 6 years earlier, macOS Big Sur features a user interface redesign. It features new blurs to establish a visual hierarchy, along with making icons more square and UI elements more consistent. Other changes include a revamp of the Time Machine backup mechanism, the control center from iOS 7, among other things. It is also the first macOS version to support Macs with ARM-based processors. To mark the transition, the operating system's major version number was incremented, for the first time since 2001, from 10 to 11.[7][8] The operating system is named after the coastal region of Big Sur in the Central Coast of California, continuing the naming trend of California locations that began with OS X Mavericks.\n\n\nmacOS Big Sur is the final version of macOS that supports Macs with Nvidia graphics cards, specifically the 15-inch dual graphics late 2013 and mid 2014 MacBook Pro models, as its successor, macOS Monterey, drops support for those models.\n\n\n\n\n## Development history[edit]\n\n\nProviding some indication as to how the pre-release operating system may have been viewed internally at Apple during its development cycle, documentation accompanying the initial beta release of macOS Big Sur referred to its version as \"10.16\", and when upgrading from prior versions of macOS using the Software Update mechanism to early beta releases, the version referred to was \"10.16\".[9] An exception to this was the Developer Transition Kit, which always reported the system version as \"11.0\".[9] macOS Big Sur started reporting the system version as \"11.0\" on all Macs as of the third beta release.\n\n\nTo maintain backwards compatibility, macOS Big Sur identified itself as 10.16 to software and in the browser user agent.[10]\n\n\n\n## System requirements[edit]\n\n\nUnlike macOS Catalina, which supported every standard configuration Mac that Mojave supported, Big Sur drops support for various Macs released in 2012 and early 2013. Big Sur runs on the following Macs:[11]\n\n\n\n* iMac (Mid 2014 or later)\n* iMac Pro (2017)\n* MacBook (Early 2015 or later)\n* MacBook Air (Mid 2013 or later)\n* MacBook Pro (Late 2013 or later)\n* Mac Mini (Late 2014 or later)\n* Mac Pro (Late 2013 or later)\n* Developer Transition Kit (only up to Big Sur 11.3 beta 2[12])\n\n\nBy using patch tools, macOS Big Sur can be installed on earlier computers that are officially unsupported, such as the 2012 iMac and the 2012 MacBook Pro.[13] Using these methods, it is possible to install macOS Big Sur on computers as old as a 2008 MacBook Pro and iMac and 2009 Mac Mini.[14]\n\n\n\n## Changes[edit]\n\n\n### Design[edit]\n\n\nMacOS Big Sur refreshes the design of the user interface, described by Apple as the biggest change since the introduction of Mac OS X.[5] Its changes include translucency in various places, a new abstract wallpaper for the first time and a new color palette. All standard apps, as well as the Dock and the Menu Bar, are redesigned and streamlined, and their icons now have square shapes like iOS and iPadOS apps, and are distinctly more round.[15] Compared to iOS, Big Sur's icons include more shading and highlights to give a three-dimensional appearance. Its aesthetic has been described as \"neumorphism\", a portmanteau of new and skeuomorphism.[16][17] System sounds are redone as well.\n\n\nThe new OS also brings further integration with Apple's SF Symbols, enabling easier use by third-party developers as UI elements for their applications through AppKit, SwiftUI, and Catalyst, which makes it possible to unify third party applications with the existing Apple-made design language.[18]\n\n\n\n### Interface[edit]\n\n\n#### Control Center[edit]\n\n\nAn interface with quick toggles for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, screen brightness and system volume has been added to the menu bar.[15] This interface is functionally and visually similar to the Control Center on iOS and iPadOS.\n\n\n\n#### Notification Center[edit]\n\n\nThe Notification Center is redesigned, featuring interactive notifications and a transparent user interface. Notification Center also features a new widget system similar to that in iOS 14, displaying more information with more customization than previously available.[5]\n\n\n\n### System[edit]\n\n\n#### Support for Apple silicon[edit]\n\n\nmacOS Big Sur is the first release of macOS for Macs powered by Apple-designed ARM64-based processors, a key part of the transition from Intel x86-64-based processors.[19] The chip mentioned in demo videos, and used in the Developer Transition Kit, is the A12Z Bionic. On November 10, 2020, Apple announced the first Mac Apple silicon chip, the Apple M1, in the Late 2020 Mac Mini, MacBook Air, and MacBook Pro.[20] Apple has said that it will support Intel Macs \"for years to come\",[19][21] and most software that has not been ported to run on ARM Macs can use Rosetta 2, an update of a compatibility mechanism originally developed for the PowerPC-to-Intel x86 transition. Likewise, Apple also introduced an updated universal binary format, Universal 2, which allows developers to package their applications so that they can run natively on both ARM64 and x86-64 processors.[22]\n\n\n\n#### Support for iOS and iPadOS applications[edit]\n\n\nOn Macs based on Apple silicon, macOS Big Sur can run iOS and iPadOS applications natively and without any modifications needed from developers, aside from allowing the app to be available on the Mac App Store.[19] The first Macs with this capability are those that use the Apple M1 SoC (system on a chip).\n\n\n\n#### Time Machine overhaul[edit]\n\n\nTime Machine, the backup mechanism introduced back in Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard, has been overhauled to utilize the APFS file system (introduced in MacOS High Sierra) instead of the outdated HFS+. Specifically, the new version of Time Machine makes use of APFS's snapshot technology.[23][24][25] According to Apple, this enables \"faster, more compact, and more reliable backups\" than were possible previously with HFS+-formatted backup destinations.[23][26] An independent evaluation of this claim found that Time Machine on macOS 11 in conjunction with APFS was 2.75-fold faster upon initial local backup and 4-fold faster upon subsequent backups relative to macOS 10.15's Time Machine implementation using HFS+.[26] A more modest yet nevertheless significant advantage was noted as well for backups to network-attached disks.[26]\n\n\nNew local (i.e. USB- or Thunderbolt-connected) and network-connected Time Machine backup destinations are formatted as APFS by default, though Time Machine can continue backing up to existing HFS+ backup volumes.[23] There is no option to convert existing, HFS+-based backups to APFS; instead, users who want to benefit from the advantages of the new, APFS-based implementation of Time Machine need to start with a fresh volume.[26]\n\n\nIn the new version of Time Machine, encryption appears to be required (instead of merely optional) for local disks, but it remains elective for networked volumes.[26]\n\n\nIt is no longer possible to restore the whole system using a Time Machine backup, as the signed system volume is not backed up. Non-core applications and user data can be restored in full using Migration Assistant, preceded by a system reinstall if necessary.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n#### Spotlight[edit]\n\n\nSpotlight, the file system indexing-and-search mechanism introduced in Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger, is faster and the interface has been refined. Spotlight is now the default search mechanism in Safari, Pages, and Keynote.[27][28]\n\n\n\n#### Signed system volume[edit]\n\n\nThe system volume containing the core operating system is cryptographically signed. Apple indicates this is a security measure to prevent malicious tampering.[29] This includes adding an SHA-256 hash for every file on the system volume, preventing changes from third-party entities and the end user.[30]\n\n\n\n#### Software updates[edit]\n\n\nSoftware updates can begin in the background before a restart, thus requiring less downtime to complete. Because system files are cryptographically signed, the update software can rely on them being in precise locations, thus permitting them to be effectively updated in place.[28]\n\n\n\n#### Encryption[edit]\n\n\nmacOS Big Sur supports encryption at the file level. Earlier versions of macOS (10.15 Catalina and older) supported encryption only at the level of entire volumes.[25] As of June 2020, this capability is known to be compatible with Macs based on Apple silicon; it is unclear whether it is compatible with Intel-based Macs.[25]\n\n\n\n### Other changes[edit]\n\n\n* Bilingual dictionaries in French–German, Indonesian–English, Japanese–Simplified Chinese and Polish–English\n* Better predictive input for Chinese and Japanese users\n* New fonts for Indian users\n* The \"Now Playing\" widget has been moved from the Notification Center to the Menu Bar\n* Podcasts \"Listen Now\" feature\n* FaceTime sign language prominence\n* Network Utility has been removed\n* The macOS startup sound is now enabled by default (it had been disabled by default on some machines released in 2016), and an option in System Preferences was added to enable or disable this functionality.[31]\n\n\n## Application features[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **is in list format but may read better as prose**.

Safari 14 includes features such as a new home page in which users can customize what features are visible in addition to being able to set a custom wallpaper. It also allows the viewer to preview a page and favicon before visiting it.[32]\n\n\nSafari 14 also includes built-in web page translations in English, Spanish, German, French, Russian, Chinese and Portuguese as well as support for 4K HDR content from Netflix on Macs with an Apple T2 chip, although none of these were made available for macOS Catalina and Mojave.[32][33]\n\n\nPrivacy features such as iCloud Keychain (which notifies users of compromised passwords), extension privacy management and Privacy Report (which monitors privacy trackers and further increases Safari's security) were added for Safari 14.[34] Users were now also able to import password from Google's Chrome browser in addition to being notified of compromised passwords.\n\n\nSafari 14 also supports WebExtensions API, the WebP image format as well as VP9 decoding, the latter of which allows for the playback of 4K and HDR content from YouTube. In addition, it allowed for better performance and power efficiency.\n\n\nSafari 14 ended support for Adobe Flash Player in September, 3 months prior to its end-of-life on December 31, 2020.[34]\n\n\n\n### Messages[edit]\n\n\nThe Messages app was rewritten to be based upon Apple's Catalyst technology[35] to enable it to have feature parity with its iOS counterpart. The new version of the app included a refined design as well as the ability to pin up to nine conversations that can sync across iOS, iPadOS and macOS. Users were also now allowed to search for messages and share their names and photos. Photo thumbnails could now also be used for group chats on the app.\n\n\nIn addition, users could mention contacts by putting the @ symbol in front of their name. They were also able to reply to specific messages. Memojis, 3d avatars were also made available on Messages.[36] On Messages, users could now select photos based on parameters.[37]\n\n\nIn India, text message effects were added when users sent certain texts (e.g., texting \"Happy Holi\" will result in users seeing effects).\n\n\n\n### Changes to the Mac App Store[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Mac App Store showing the Safari Extensions category\nRefinements and new features of the Mac App Store include:\n\n\n\n* A new \"nutrition label\" section dedicated to the data and information an app collects, also featured in the iOS App Store\n* A new extensions category for Safari\n* Third party Notification Center widgets, similar to those also added in iOS and iPadOS 14.\n* The ability to share in-app purchases and subscriptions on the Mac via iCloud Family Sharing\n\n\n### Notes[edit]\n\n\n* Collapsible pinned section\n* Quick text style and formatting options\n* Scanning enhancements\n\n\n### Photos[edit]\n\n\n* New editing capabilities\n* Improved Retouch tool\n* New zooming feature in views\n\n\n### Maps[edit]\n\n\n* \"Look Around\" interactive street-level 360° panoramas, first implemented in the iOS 13 version of Maps, have been incorporated into the macOS version of Maps.\n* Availability of directions for cyclists.\n* Electric vehicle routing, based on proximity to charging stations and monitoring of battery levels (on selected car models).\n* Guides for exploring new places.\n\n\n### Voice Memos[edit]\n\n\n* a file structure has been implemented to allow organization of recordings in folders[38]\n* recordings can be marked as Favorites for easier subsequent access\n* Smart Folders automatically group Apple Watch recordings, recently deleted recordings, and Favorites\n* audio can be enhanced to reduce background noise and room reverb\n\n\n### Other applications found in macOS 11 Big Sur[edit]\n\n\n* About This Mac\n* Activity Monitor\n* AirPort Utility\n* Archive Utility\n* Audio MIDI Setup\n* Automator\n* Bluetooth File Exchange\n* Books\n* Boot Camp Assistant\n* Calculator\n* Calendar\n* Chess\n* ColorSync Utility\n* Console\n* Contacts\n* Dictionary\n* Digital Color Meter\n* Directory Utility\n* Disk Utility\n* DVD Player\n* Expansion Slot Utility\n* FaceTime\n* Feedback Assistant\n* Find My\n* Finder\n* Folder Actions Setup\n* Font Book\n* Grapher\n* Home\n* Image Capture\n* iOS App Installer\n* Keychain Access\n* Mail\n* Launchpad\n* Migration Assistant\n* Mission Control\n* Music\n* Network Utility\n* News (only available for Australia, Canada, United Kingdom, and United States)\n* Photo Booth\n* Podcasts\n* Preview\n* QuickTime Player\n* Reminders\n* Screenshot (succeeded Grab since macOS 10.14 Mojave)\n* Script Editor\n* Siri\n* Stickies\n* Stocks\n* Storage Management\n* System Information\n* Terminal\n* TextEdit\n* Ticket Viewer\n* Time Machine\n* TV\n* VoiceOver Utility\n* Wireless Diagnostics\n\n## Removed functionality[edit]\n\n\n* Calculator Notification Center Widget[39]\n* Option to toggle Font Smoothing in System Preferences\n* Support in Safari for AdBlock plugins like uBlock Origin\n* Removed the option not to have a clock in the menu bar.\n\n\n## Criticism[edit]\n\n\nThe rollout of Big Sur came with several problems.[40] Upgrading to the initial public release of Big Sur (version 11.0.1) bricked some computers, rendering them unusable. Many of these were 2013 and 2014 MacBook Pros, though problems were also observed on a 2019 MacBook Pro and an iMac from the same year.[41][42][43] The initial rollout also disrupted Apple's app notarization process, causing slowdowns even on devices not running Big Sur.[44] Users also reported that the update was slow or even might fail to install.[45] macOS Catalina and Big Sur apps were taking a long time to load because of Gatekeeper issues.[46]\n\n\nThe issues with the COVID-19 pandemic meant it was hard for users to visit an Apple Store to get their machines fixed.[47] Shortly afterwards, Apple released a series of steps explaining how these Macs could be recovered.[48]\n\n\nCertain Apple applications running on early versions of Big Sur were reported to bypass firewalls, raising privacy and security concerns.[49][50] This was addressed with the release of macOS Big Sur 11.2, which removed the whitelist for built-in programs.[51][52] Conversely, security experts have reported that Big Sur will check an application's certificate every time it is run, degrading system performance. There have been reports that the operating system sends a hash back to Apple of every program run and when it was executed.[53] Apple responded that the process is part of efforts to protect users from malware embedded in applications downloaded outside of the Mac App Store.[53]\n\n\nSome users have reported problems connecting external displays to Macs running Big Sur 11.1 and 11.2.[54]\n\n\nWhen upgrading Macs from 10.13, 10.14 and 10.15 to Big Sur the upgrade process could become stuck for seemingly unclear reasons. Only a full system restore from backup would solve this problem. In October 2021, a solution became known that required removal of up to several hundreds of thousands excess temporary files in the system folders.[55]\n\n\n\n## Vulnerability[edit]\n\n\nIn 2021, there were reports of two pieces of malware that infected macOS and include both x86-64 and ARM64 code. The first one was detected in early 2021.[56] The second one, Silver Sparrow, was detected on nearly 30,000 Macs in February 2021.[57][58][59]\n\n\n\n## Release history[edit]\n\n\nThe public release of macOS 11 Big Sur began with 11.0.1 for Intel Macs. Version 11.0 was preinstalled on Apple silicon Macs, and Apple advised those with that version to be updated to 11.0.1.[60]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Previous release\n |  | Current release\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Version\n | Build\n | Release date\n | Darwin version\n | Release notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 11.0[a] | 20A2411\n | November 17, 2020\n | 20.1.0xnu-7195.41.8~9 | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 11.0.1\n | 20B29[b] | November 12, 2020\n | 20.1.0xnu-7195.50.7~2 |\n| 20B50[c] | November 19, 2020\n |\n| 11.1\n | 20C69\n | December 14, 2020\n | 20.2.0xnu-7195.60.75~1 | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 11.2\n | 20D64\n | February 1, 2021\n | 20.3.0xnu-7195.81.3~1 | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 11.2.1\n | 20D74\n | February 9, 2021\n | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 20D75[d] | February 15, 2021\n |\n| 11.2.2\n | 20D80\n | February 25, 2021\n | Release notes |\n| 11.2.3\n | 20D91\n | March 8, 2021\n | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 11.3\n | 20E232\n | April 26, 2021\n | 20.4.0xnu-7195.101.1~3 | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 11.3.1\n | 20E241\n | May 3, 2021\n | 20.4.0xnu-7195.101.2~1 | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 11.4\n | 20F71\n | May 24, 2021\n | 20.5.0xnu-7195.121.3~9 | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 11.5\n | 20G71\n | July 21, 2021\n | 20.6.0xnu-7195.141.2~5Wed Jun 23 00:26:31 PDT 2021 | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 11.5.1\n | 20G80\n | July 26, 2021\n | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 11.5.2\n | 20G95\n | August 11, 2021\n | Release notes |\n| 11.6\n | 20G165\n | September 13, 2021\n | 20.6.0xnu-7195.141.6~3Mon Aug 30 06:12:21 PDT 2021 | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 11.6.1\n | 20G224\n | October 25, 2021\n | 20.6.0xnu-7195.141.8~1Tue Oct 12 18:33:42 PDT 2021 | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 11.6.2\n | 20G314\n | December 13, 2021\n | 20.6.0xnu-7195.141.14~1Wed Nov 10 22:23:07 PST 2021 | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 11.6.3\n | 20G415\n | January 26, 2022\n | 20.6.0xnu-7195.141.19~2Wed Jan 12 22:22:42 PST 2022 | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 11.6.4\n | 20G417\n | February 14, 2022\n | Release notes |\n| 11.6.5\n | 20G527\n | March 14, 2022\n | 20.6.0xnu-7195.141.26~1Tue Feb 22 21:10:41 PST 2022 | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 11.6.6\n | 20G624\n | May 16, 2022\n | 20.6.0xnu-7195.141.29~1Tue Apr 19 21:04:45 PDT 2022 | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 11.6.7\n | 20G630\n | June 9, 2022\n | Release notes |\n| 11.6.8\n | 20G730\n | July 20, 2022\n | 20.6.0xnu-7195.141.32~1Tue Jun 21 20:50:28 PDT 2022 | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 11.7\n | 20G817\n | September 12, 2022\n | 20.6.0xnu-7195.141.39~2Mon Aug 29 04:31:06 PDT 2022 | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 11.7.1\n | 20G918\n | October 24, 2022\n | 20.6.0xnu-7195.141.42~1Thu Sep 29 20:15:11 PDT 2022 | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 11.7.2\n | 20G1020\n | December 13, 2022\n | 20.6.0xnu-7195.141.46~1Sun Nov 6 23:17:00 PST 2022 | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 11.7.3\n | 20G1116\n | January 23, 2023\n | 20.6.0xnu-7195.141.49~1Fri Dec 16 00:35:00 PST 2022 | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 11.7.4\n | 20G1120\n | February 15, 2023\n | Release notes |\n| 11.7.5\n | 20G1225\n | March 27, 2023\n | 20.6.0xnu-7195.141.49.700.6~1Thu Mar 9 20:39:26 PST 2023 | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 11.7.6\n | 20G1231\n | April 10, 2023\n | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 11.7.7\n | 20G1345\n | May 18, 2023\n | 20.6.0xnu-7195.141.49.701.3~1Mon Apr 24 23:00:57 PDT 2023 | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 11.7.8\n | 20G1351\n | June 21, 2023\n | 20.6.0xnu-7195.141.49.701.4~1Thu Jun 8 22:36:09 PDT 2023 | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 11.7.9\n | 20G1426\n | July 24, 2023\n | 20.6.0xnu-7195.141.49.702.12~1Thu Jul 6 22:12:47 PDT 2023 | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 11.7.10\n | 20G1427\n | September 11, 2023\n | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n\n\n*See Apple's main pages for Big Sur release notes: for consumers, for enterprise, as well as their current security content page.*\n\n\n\n1. **^** Preinstalled on MacBook Air (M1, 2020), MacBook Pro (13-inch, M1, 2020), and Mac mini (M1, 2020)\n2. **^** Initial public release\n3. **^** Available for all Macs except Late 2013 and Mid 2014 13\" MacBook Pros\n4. **^** Fixes bug where installation with insufficient free space could cause data loss – exclusive to the full installer\n\n## Timeline of Mac operating systems[edit]\n\n\n| Timeline of Mac operating systems * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)\n |\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Rossignol, Joe (November 10, 2020). \"Apple Releasing macOS Big Sur on November 12\". *MacRumors*.

It was announced at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on June 22, 2020,[4] and was released to the public on November 12, 2020.[5][4][6]\n\n\nBig Sur is the successor to macOS Catalina, and was succeeded by macOS Monterey, which was released on October 25, 2021. The release of Big Sur was the first time the major version number of the operating system had been incremented since the Mac OS X Public Beta in 2000.\n\n\nFor the first time since OS X Yosemite 6 years earlier, macOS Big Sur features a user interface redesign. It features new blurs to establish a visual hierarchy, along with making icons more square and UI elements more consistent. Other changes include a revamp of the Time Machine backup mechanism, the control center from iOS 7, among other things. It is also the first macOS version to support Macs with ARM-based processors. To mark the transition, the operating system's major version number was incremented, for the first time since 2001, from 10 to 11.[7][8] The operating system is named after the coastal region of Big Sur in the Central Coast of California, continuing the naming trend of California locations that began with OS X Mavericks.\n\n\nmacOS Big Sur is the final version of macOS that supports Macs with Nvidia graphics cards, specifically the 15-inch dual graphics late 2013 and mid 2014 MacBook Pro models, as its successor, macOS Monterey, drops support for those models.\n\n\n\n\n## Development history[edit]\n\n\nProviding some indication as to how the pre-release operating system may have been viewed internally at Apple during its development cycle, documentation accompanying the initial beta release of macOS Big Sur referred to its version as \"10.16\", and when upgrading from prior versions of macOS using the Software Update mechanism to early beta releases, the version referred to was \"10.16\".[9] An exception to this was the Developer Transition Kit, which always reported the system version as \"11.0\".[9] macOS Big Sur started reporting the system version as \"11.0\" on all Macs as of the third beta release.\n\n\nTo maintain backwards compatibility, macOS Big Sur identified itself as 10.16 to software and in the browser user agent.[10]\n\n\n\n## System requirements[edit]\n\n\nUnlike macOS Catalina, which supported every standard configuration Mac that Mojave supported, Big Sur drops support for various Macs released in 2012 and early 2013. Big Sur runs on the following Macs:[11]\n\n\n\n* iMac (Mid 2014 or later)\n* iMac Pro (2017)\n* MacBook (Early 2015 or later)\n* MacBook Air (Mid 2013 or later)\n* MacBook Pro (Late 2013 or later)\n* Mac Mini (Late 2014 or later)\n* Mac Pro (Late 2013 or later)\n* Developer Transition Kit (only up to Big Sur 11.3 beta 2[12])\n\n\nBy using patch tools, macOS Big Sur can be installed on earlier computers that are officially unsupported, such as the 2012 iMac and the 2012 MacBook Pro.[13] Using these methods, it is possible to install macOS Big Sur on computers as old as a 2008 MacBook Pro and iMac and 2009 Mac Mini.[14]\n\n\n\n## Changes[edit]\n\n\n### Design[edit]\n\n\nMacOS Big Sur refreshes the design of the user interface, described by Apple as the biggest change since the introduction of Mac OS X.[5] Its changes include translucency in various places, a new abstract wallpaper for the first time and a new color palette. All standard apps, as well as the Dock and the Menu Bar, are redesigned and streamlined, and their icons now have square shapes like iOS and iPadOS apps, and are distinctly more round.[15] Compared to iOS, Big Sur's icons include more shading and highlights to give a three-dimensional appearance. Its aesthetic has been described as \"neumorphism\", a portmanteau of new and skeuomorphism.[16][17] System sounds are redone as well.\n\n\nThe new OS also brings further integration with Apple's SF Symbols, enabling easier use by third-party developers as UI elements for their applications through AppKit, SwiftUI, and Catalyst, which makes it possible to unify third party applications with the existing Apple-made design language.[18]\n\n\n\n### Interface[edit]\n\n\n#### Control Center[edit]\n\n\nAn interface with quick toggles for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, screen brightness and system volume has been added to the menu bar.[15] This interface is functionally and visually similar to the Control Center on iOS and iPadOS.\n\n\n\n#### Notification Center[edit]\n\n\nThe Notification Center is redesigned, featuring interactive notifications and a transparent user interface. Notification Center also features a new widget system similar to that in iOS 14, displaying more information with more customization than previously available.[5]\n\n\n\n### System[edit]\n\n\n#### Support for Apple silicon[edit]\n\n\nmacOS Big Sur is the first release of macOS for Macs powered by Apple-designed ARM64-based processors, a key part of the transition from Intel x86-64-based processors.[19] The chip mentioned in demo videos, and used in the Developer Transition Kit, is the A12Z Bionic. On November 10, 2020, Apple announced the first Mac Apple silicon chip, the Apple M1, in the Late 2020 Mac Mini, MacBook Air, and MacBook Pro.[20] Apple has said that it will support Intel Macs \"for years to come\",[19][21] and most software that has not been ported to run on ARM Macs can use Rosetta 2, an update of a compatibility mechanism originally developed for the PowerPC-to-Intel x86 transition. Likewise, Apple also introduced an updated universal binary format, Universal 2, which allows developers to package their applications so that they can run natively on both ARM64 and x86-64 processors.[22]\n\n\n\n#### Support for iOS and iPadOS applications[edit]\n\n\nOn Macs based on Apple silicon, macOS Big Sur can run iOS and iPadOS applications natively and without any modifications needed from developers, aside from allowing the app to be available on the Mac App Store.[19] The first Macs with this capability are those that use the Apple M1 SoC (system on a chip).\n\n\n\n#### Time Machine overhaul[edit]\n\n\nTime Machine, the backup mechanism introduced back in Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard, has been overhauled to utilize the APFS file system (introduced in MacOS High Sierra) instead of the outdated HFS+. Specifically, the new version of Time Machine makes use of APFS's snapshot technology.[23][24][25] According to Apple, this enables \"faster, more compact, and more reliable backups\" than were possible previously with HFS+-formatted backup destinations.[23][26] An independent evaluation of this claim found that Time Machine on macOS 11 in conjunction with APFS was 2.75-fold faster upon initial local backup and 4-fold faster upon subsequent backups relative to macOS 10.15's Time Machine implementation using HFS+.[26] A more modest yet nevertheless significant advantage was noted as well for backups to network-attached disks.[26]\n\n\nNew local (i.e. USB- or Thunderbolt-connected) and network-connected Time Machine backup destinations are formatted as APFS by default, though Time Machine can continue backing up to existing HFS+ backup volumes.[23] There is no option to convert existing, HFS+-based backups to APFS; instead, users who want to benefit from the advantages of the new, APFS-based implementation of Time Machine need to start with a fresh volume.[26]\n\n\nIn the new version of Time Machine, encryption appears to be required (instead of merely optional) for local disks, but it remains elective for networked volumes.[26]\n\n\nIt is no longer possible to restore the whole system using a Time Machine backup, as the signed system volume is not backed up. Non-core applications and user data can be restored in full using Migration Assistant, preceded by a system reinstall if necessary.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n#### Spotlight[edit]\n\n\nSpotlight, the file system indexing-and-search mechanism introduced in Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger, is faster and the interface has been refined. Spotlight is now the default search mechanism in Safari, Pages, and Keynote.[27][28]\n\n\n\n#### Signed system volume[edit]\n\n\nThe system volume containing the core operating system is cryptographically signed. Apple indicates this is a security measure to prevent malicious tampering.[29] This includes adding an SHA-256 hash for every file on the system volume, preventing changes from third-party entities and the end user.[30]\n\n\n\n#### Software updates[edit]\n\n\nSoftware updates can begin in the background before a restart, thus requiring less downtime to complete. Because system files are cryptographically signed, the update software can rely on them being in precise locations, thus permitting them to be effectively updated in place.[28]\n\n\n\n#### Encryption[edit]\n\n\nmacOS Big Sur supports encryption at the file level. Earlier versions of macOS (10.15 Catalina and older) supported encryption only at the level of entire volumes.[25] As of June 2020, this capability is known to be compatible with Macs based on Apple silicon; it is unclear whether it is compatible with Intel-based Macs.[25]\n\n\n\n### Other changes[edit]\n\n\n* Bilingual dictionaries in French–German, Indonesian–English, Japanese–Simplified Chinese and Polish–English\n* Better predictive input for Chinese and Japanese users\n* New fonts for Indian users\n* The \"Now Playing\" widget has been moved from the Notification Center to the Menu Bar\n* Podcasts \"Listen Now\" feature\n* FaceTime sign language prominence\n* Network Utility has been removed\n* The macOS startup sound is now enabled by default (it had been disabled by default on some machines released in 2016), and an option in System Preferences was added to enable or disable this functionality.[31]\n\n\n## Application features[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **is in list format but may read better as prose**.

Editing help is available. *(November 2021)*\n |\n\n\n![](image)The Safari 14 start page with Wikipedia on the reading list\n### Safari[edit]\n\n\nBig Sur includes Safari 14, which was also released for macOS Catalina and macOS Mojave on September 16, 2020. Safari 14 includes features such as a new home page in which users can customize what features are visible in addition to being able to set a custom wallpaper. It also allows the viewer to preview a page and favicon before visiting it.[32]\n\n\nSafari 14 also includes built-in web page translations in English, Spanish, German, French, Russian, Chinese and Portuguese as well as support for 4K HDR content from Netflix on Macs with an Apple T2 chip, although none of these were made available for macOS Catalina and Mojave.[32][33]\n\n\nPrivacy features such as iCloud Keychain (which notifies users of compromised passwords), extension privacy management and Privacy Report (which monitors privacy trackers and further increases Safari's security) were added for Safari 14.[34] Users were now also able to import password from Google's Chrome browser in addition to being notified of compromised passwords.\n\n\nSafari 14 also supports WebExtensions API, the WebP image format as well as VP9 decoding, the latter of which allows for the playback of 4K and HDR content from YouTube. In addition, it allowed for better performance and power efficiency.\n\n\nSafari 14 ended support for Adobe Flash Player in September, 3 months prior to its end-of-life on December 31, 2020.[34]\n\n\n\n### Messages[edit]\n\n\nThe Messages app was rewritten to be based upon Apple's Catalyst technology[35] to enable it to have feature parity with its iOS counterpart. The new version of the app included a refined design as well as the ability to pin up to nine conversations that can sync across iOS, iPadOS and macOS. Users were also now allowed to search for messages and share their names and photos. Photo thumbnails could now also be used for group chats on the app.\n\n\nIn addition, users could mention contacts by putting the @ symbol in front of their name.

Many of these were 2013 and 2014 MacBook Pros, though problems were also observed on a 2019 MacBook Pro and an iMac from the same year.[41][42][43] The initial rollout also disrupted Apple's app notarization process, causing slowdowns even on devices not running Big Sur.[44] Users also reported that the update was slow or even might fail to install.[45] macOS Catalina and Big Sur apps were taking a long time to load because of Gatekeeper issues.[46]\n\n\nThe issues with the COVID-19 pandemic meant it was hard for users to visit an Apple Store to get their machines fixed.[47] Shortly afterwards, Apple released a series of steps explaining how these Macs could be recovered.[48]\n\n\nCertain Apple applications running on early versions of Big Sur were reported to bypass firewalls, raising privacy and security concerns.[49][50] This was addressed with the release of macOS Big Sur 11.2, which removed the whitelist for built-in programs.[51][52] Conversely, security experts have reported that Big Sur will check an application's certificate every time it is run, degrading system performance. There have been reports that the operating system sends a hash back to Apple of every program run and when it was executed.[53] Apple responded that the process is part of efforts to protect users from malware embedded in applications downloaded outside of the Mac App Store.[53]\n\n\nSome users have reported problems connecting external displays to Macs running Big Sur 11.1 and 11.2.[54]\n\n\nWhen upgrading Macs from 10.13, 10.14 and 10.15 to Big Sur the upgrade process could become stuck for seemingly unclear reasons. Only a full system restore from backup would solve this problem. In October 2021, a solution became known that required removal of up to several hundreds of thousands excess temporary files in the system folders.[55]\n\n\n\n## Vulnerability[edit]\n\n\nIn 2021, there were reports of two pieces of malware that infected macOS and include both x86-64 and ARM64 code. The first one was detected in early 2021.[56] The second one, Silver Sparrow, was detected on nearly 30,000 Macs in February 2021.[57][58][59]\n\n\n\n## Release history[edit]\n\n\nThe public release of macOS 11 Big Sur began with 11.0.1 for Intel Macs. Version 11.0 was preinstalled on Apple silicon Macs, and Apple advised those with that version to be updated to 11.0.1.[60]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Previous release\n |  | Current release\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Version\n | Build\n | Release date\n | Darwin version\n | Release notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 11.0[a] | 20A2411\n | November 17, 2020\n | 20.1.0xnu-7195.41.8~9 | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 11.0.1\n | 20B29[b] | November 12, 2020\n | 20.1.0xnu-7195.50.7~2 |\n| 20B50[c] | November 19, 2020\n |\n| 11.1\n | 20C69\n | December 14, 2020\n | 20.2.0xnu-7195.60.75~1 | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 11.2\n | 20D64\n | February 1, 2021\n | 20.3.0xnu-7195.81.3~1 | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 11.2.1\n | 20D74\n | February 9, 2021\n | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 20D75[d] | February 15, 2021\n |\n| 11.2.2\n | 20D80\n | February 25, 2021\n | Release notes |\n| 11.2.3\n | 20D91\n | March 8, 2021\n | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 11.3\n | 20E232\n | April 26, 2021\n | 20.4.0xnu-7195.101.1~3 | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 11.3.1\n | 20E241\n | May 3, 2021\n | 20.4.0xnu-7195.101.2~1 | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 11.4\n | 20F71\n | May 24, 2021\n | 20.5.0xnu-7195.121.3~9 | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 11.5\n | 20G71\n | July 21, 2021\n | 20.6.0xnu-7195.141.2~5Wed Jun 23 00:26:31 PDT 2021 | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 11.5.1\n | 20G80\n | July 26, 2021\n | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 11.5.2\n | 20G95\n | August 11, 2021\n | Release notes |\n| 11.6\n | 20G165\n | September 13, 2021\n | 20.6.0xnu-7195.141.6~3Mon Aug 30 06:12:21 PDT 2021 | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 11.6.1\n | 20G224\n | October 25, 2021\n | 20.6.0xnu-7195.141.8~1Tue Oct 12 18:33:42 PDT 2021 | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 11.6.2\n | 20G314\n | December 13, 2021\n | 20.6.0xnu-7195.141.14~1Wed Nov 10 22:23:07 PST 2021 | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 11.6.3\n | 20G415\n | January 26, 2022\n | 20.6.0xnu-7195.141.19~2Wed Jan 12 22:22:42 PST 2022 | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 11.6.4\n | 20G417\n | February 14, 2022\n | Release notes |\n| 11.6.5\n | 20G527\n | March 14, 2022\n | 20.6.0xnu-7195.141.26~1Tue Feb 22 21:10:41 PST 2022 | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 11.6.6\n | 20G624\n | May 16, 2022\n | 20.6.0xnu-7195.141.29~1Tue Apr 19 21:04:45 PDT 2022 | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 11.6.7\n | 20G630\n | June 9, 2022\n | Release notes |\n| 11.6.8\n | 20G730\n | July 20, 2022\n | 20.6.0xnu-7195.141.32~1Tue Jun 21 20:50:28 PDT 2022 | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 11.7\n | 20G817\n | September 12, 2022\n | 20.6.0xnu-7195.141.39~2Mon Aug 29 04:31:06 PDT 2022 | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 11.7.1\n | 20G918\n | October 24, 2022\n | 20.6.0xnu-7195.141.42~1Thu Sep 29 20:15:11 PDT 2022 | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 11.7.2\n | 20G1020\n | December 13, 2022\n | 20.6.0xnu-7195.141.46~1Sun Nov 6 23:17:00 PST 2022 | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 11.7.3\n | 20G1116\n | January 23, 2023\n | 20.6.0xnu-7195.141.49~1Fri Dec 16 00:35:00 PST 2022 | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 11.7.4\n | 20G1120\n | February 15, 2023\n | Release notes |\n| 11.7.5\n | 20G1225\n | March 27, 2023\n | 20.6.0xnu-7195.141.49.700.6~1Thu Mar 9 20:39:26 PST 2023 | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 11.7.6\n | 20G1231\n | April 10, 2023\n | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 11.7.7\n | 20G1345\n | May 18, 2023\n | 20.6.0xnu-7195.141.49.701.3~1Mon Apr 24 23:00:57 PDT 2023 | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 11.7.8\n | 20G1351\n | June 21, 2023\n | 20.6.0xnu-7195.141.49.701.4~1Thu Jun 8 22:36:09 PDT 2023 | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 11.7.9\n | 20G1426\n | July 24, 2023\n | 20.6.0xnu-7195.141.49.702.12~1Thu Jul 6 22:12:47 PDT 2023 | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 11.7.10\n | 20G1427\n | September 11, 2023\n | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n\n\n*See Apple's main pages for Big Sur release notes: for consumers, for enterprise, as well as their current security content page.*\n\n\n\n1. **^** Preinstalled on MacBook Air (M1, 2020), MacBook Pro (13-inch, M1, 2020), and Mac mini (M1, 2020)\n2. **^** Initial public release\n3. **^** Available for all Macs except Late 2013 and Mid 2014 13\" MacBook Pros\n4. **^** Fixes bug where installation with insufficient free space could cause data loss – exclusive to the full installer\n\n## Timeline of Mac operating systems[edit]\n\n\n| Timeline of Mac operating systems * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)\n |\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Rossignol, Joe (November 10, 2020). \"Apple Releasing macOS Big Sur on November 12\". *MacRumors*.

It is the successor to macOS Mojave and was announced at WWDC 2019 on June 3, 2019 and released to the public on October 7, 2019. Catalina is the first version of macOS to support only 64-bit applications and the first to include Activation Lock.[3][1] It is also the last version of macOS to have the major version number of 10; its successor, Big Sur, released on November 12, 2020, is version 11.[4][5] In order to increase web compatibility, Safari, Chromium and Firefox have frozen the OS in the user agent running in subsequent releases of macOS at 10.15.7 Catalina.[6][7][8]\n\n\nThe operating system is named after Santa Catalina Island, which is located off the coast of southern California. \n\n\nmacOS Catalina is the final version of macOS that supports the Unibody MacBook Pro, as its successor, macOS Big Sur, drops support for its mid 2012 and final model.\n\n\n\n\n## System requirements[edit]\n\n\nmacOS Catalina officially runs on all standard configuration Macs that supported Mojave. 2010 to 2012 Mac Pros, which could run Mojave only with a GPU upgrade, are no longer supported.[1] Catalina requires 4 GB of memory, an increase over the 2 GB required by Lion through Mojave.[9][10]\n\n\n\n* iMac (Late 2012 or later)\n* iMac Pro (2017)\n* MacBook (Early 2015 or later)\n* MacBook Air (Mid 2012 or later)\n* MacBook Pro (Mid 2012 or later)\n* Mac Mini (Late 2012 or later)\n* Mac Pro (Late 2013 or later)\n\n\nIt is possible to install Catalina on many older Macintosh computers that are not officially supported by Apple. This requires using a patch to modify the install image.[11]\n\n\n\n## Changes[edit]\n\n\n### System[edit]\n\n\n#### Catalyst[edit]\n\n\nCatalyst is a new software-development tool that allows developers to write apps that can run on macOS, iOS and iPadOS. Apple demonstrated several ported apps, including Jira and Twitter (after the latter discontinued its macOS app in February 2018).[12][13][14]\n\n\n\n#### System extensions[edit]\n\n\nAn upgrade from Kexts. System extensions avoid the problems of Kexts. There are 3 kinds of System extensions: Network Extensions, Endpoint Security Extensions, and Driver Extensions. System extensions run in userspace, outside of the kernel.[15][16] Catalina will be the last version of macOS to support legacy system extensions.[17][18]\n\n\n\n#### DriverKit[edit]\n\n\nA replacement for IOKit device drivers, driver extensions are built using DriverKit. DriverKit is a new SDK with all-new frameworks based on IOKit, but updated and modernized. It is designed for building device drivers in userspace, outside of the kernel.[19][16]\n\n\n\n#### Gatekeeper[edit]\n\n\nMac apps, installer packages, and kernel extensions that are signed with a Developer ID must be notarized by Apple to run on macOS Catalina.[20]\n\n\n\n#### Activation Lock[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Laptop theft\n\nActivation Lock helps prevent the unauthorized use and drive erasure of devices with an Apple T2 security chip (2018, 2019, and 2020 MacBook Pro; 2020 5K iMac; 2018 MacBook Air, iMac Pro; 2018 Mac Mini; 2019 Mac Pro).[1][21]\n\n\n\n#### Dedicated system volume[edit]\n\n\nThe system runs on its own read-only volume, separate from all other data on the Mac.[1]\n\n\n\n#### Voice control[edit]\n\n\nUsers can give detailed voice commands to applications.[22] On-device machine processing is used to offer better navigation.[1]\n\n\n\n#### Sidecar[edit]\n\n\nSidecar allows a Mac to use an iPad (running iPadOS) as a wireless external display. With Apple Pencil, the device can also be used as a graphics tablet for software running on the computer.[13][23] Sidecar requires a Mac with Intel Skylake CPUs and newer (such as the fourth-generation MacBook Pro), and an iPad that supports Apple Pencil.[24][25]\n\n\n\n#### Support for wireless game controllers[edit]\n\n\nThe Game Controller framework adds support for two major console game controllers: the PlayStation 4's DualShock 4 and the Xbox One controller.[26][27][28][29]\n\n\n\n#### Time Machine[edit]\n\n\nA number of under-the-hood changes were made to Time Machine, the backup software. For example, the manner in which backup data is stored on network-attached devices was changed, and this change is not backwards-compatible with earlier versions of macOS.[30]\nApple declined to document these changes, but some of them have been noted.[30]\n\n\n\n### Applications[edit]\n\n\n#### iTunes[edit]\n\n\niTunes is replaced by separate Music, Podcasts, TV and Books apps, in line with iOS. iOS device management is now conducted via Finder.[31][32] The TV app on Mac supports Dolby Atmos, Dolby Vision, and HDR10 on MacBooks released in 2018 or later, while 4K HDR playback is supported on Macs released in 2018 or later when connected to a compatible display.[13]\n\n\n\n#### Find My[edit]\n\n\nFind My Mac and Find My Friends are merged into an application called Find My.\n\n\n\n#### Notes[edit]\n\n\nThe Notes application was enhanced to allow better management of checklists and the ability to share folders with other users. The application version was incremented from 4.6 (in macOS 10.14 Mojave) to 4.7.\n\n\n\n#### Reminders[edit]\n\n\nAmong other visual and functional overhauls, attachments can be added to reminders and Siri can intelligently estimate when to remind the user about an event.[1]\n\n\n\n#### Voice Memos[edit]\n\n\nThe Voice Memos application, first ported from iOS to the Mac in macOS 10.14 Mojave as version 2.0, was incremented to version 2.1.\n\n\n\n#### Removed or changed components[edit]\n\n\nmacOS Catalina exclusively supports 64-bit applications. 32-bit applications no longer run (including all software that utilizes the Carbon API as well as QuickTime 7 applications, image, audio and video codecs). Apple has also removed all 32-bit-only apps from the Mac App Store.[33]\n\n\nZ shell (executable \"zsh\") is the default login shell and interactive shell in macOS Catalina,[34] replacing Bash, the default shell since Mac OS X Panther in 2003.[35] Bash continues to be available in macOS Catalina, along with other shells such as csh/tcsh and ksh.\n\n\nDashboard has been removed in macOS Catalina.[36]\n\n\nThe ability to add Backgrounds in Photo Booth was removed in macOS Catalina.\n\n\nThe command-line interface GNU Emacs application was removed in macOS Catalina.\n\n\nBuilt-in support for Perl, Python 2.7 and Ruby are included in macOS for compatibility with legacy software.[37] Future versions of macOS will not include scripting language runtimes by default, possibly requiring users to install additional packages.[38]\n\n\nLegacy AirDrop for connecting with Macs running Mac OS X Lion, Mountain Lion and Mavericks, or 2011 and older Macs has been removed.[39]\n\n\n\n## Security[edit]\n\n\n*Ars Technica* reported that macOS Catalina contained a critical privilege escalation vulnerability, which resulted in a backdoor being installed if users visited a Hong Kong pro-democracy website. The vulnerability was reported to Apple in August 2021, and patched in a Catalina update in September, but it had already been patched by Apple in macOS Big Sur 11.2, released 234 days earlier on February 1. Security experts have criticized Apple for not patching critical known vulnerabilities in older versions, and for not being transparent about older versions only receiving some, but not all, security patches. The latest major release of Apple's operating systems (macOS, iOS, and others) receive all security updates.[40][41][42]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\nCatalina received favorable reviews on release for some of its features.[43] However, some critics found the OS version distinctly less reliable than earlier versions.[44][45][46][47][48] The broad addition of user-facing security measures (somewhat analogous to the addition of User Account Control dialog boxes with Windows Vista a decade earlier) was criticized as intrusive and annoying.[46][49]\n\n\n\n## Release

It is the successor to macOS Mojave and was announced at WWDC 2019 on June 3, 2019 and released to the public on October 7, 2019. Catalina is the first version of macOS to support only 64-bit applications and the first to include Activation Lock.[3][1] It is also the last version of macOS to have the major version number of 10; its successor, Big Sur, released on November 12, 2020, is version 11.[4][5] In order to increase web compatibility, Safari, Chromium and Firefox have frozen the OS in the user agent running in subsequent releases of macOS at 10.15.7 Catalina.[6][7][8]\n\n\nThe operating system is named after Santa Catalina Island, which is located off the coast of southern California. \n\n\nmacOS Catalina is the final version of macOS that supports the Unibody MacBook Pro, as its successor, macOS Big Sur, drops support for its mid 2012 and final model.\n\n\n\n\n## System requirements[edit]\n\n\nmacOS Catalina officially runs on all standard configuration Macs that supported Mojave. 2010 to 2012 Mac Pros, which could run Mojave only with a GPU upgrade, are no longer supported.[1] Catalina requires 4 GB of memory, an increase over the 2 GB required by Lion through Mojave.[9][10]\n\n\n\n* iMac (Late 2012 or later)\n* iMac Pro (2017)\n* MacBook (Early 2015 or later)\n* MacBook Air (Mid 2012 or later)\n* MacBook Pro (Mid 2012 or later)\n* Mac Mini (Late 2012 or later)\n* Mac Pro (Late 2013 or later)\n\n\nIt is possible to install Catalina on many older Macintosh computers that are not officially supported by Apple. This requires using a patch to modify the install image.[11]\n\n\n\n## Changes[edit]\n\n\n### System[edit]\n\n\n#### Catalyst[edit]\n\n\nCatalyst is a new software-development tool that allows developers to write apps that can run on macOS, iOS and iPadOS. Apple demonstrated several ported apps, including Jira and Twitter (after the latter discontinued its macOS app in February 2018).[12][13][14]\n\n\n\n#### System extensions[edit]\n\n\nAn upgrade from Kexts. System extensions avoid the problems of Kexts. There are 3 kinds of System extensions: Network Extensions, Endpoint Security Extensions, and Driver Extensions. System extensions run in userspace, outside of the kernel.[15][16] Catalina will be the last version of macOS to support legacy system extensions.[17][18]\n\n\n\n#### DriverKit[edit]\n\n\nA replacement for IOKit device drivers, driver extensions are built using DriverKit. DriverKit is a new SDK with all-new frameworks based on IOKit, but updated and modernized. It is designed for building device drivers in userspace, outside of the kernel.[19][16]\n\n\n\n#### Gatekeeper[edit]\n\n\nMac apps, installer packages, and kernel extensions that are signed with a Developer ID must be notarized by Apple to run on macOS Catalina.[20]\n\n\n\n#### Activation Lock[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Laptop theft\n\nActivation Lock helps prevent the unauthorized use and drive erasure of devices with an Apple T2 security chip (2018, 2019, and 2020 MacBook Pro; 2020 5K iMac; 2018 MacBook Air, iMac Pro; 2018 Mac Mini; 2019 Mac Pro).[1][21]\n\n\n\n#### Dedicated system volume[edit]\n\n\nThe system runs on its own read-only volume, separate from all other data on the Mac.[1]\n\n\n\n#### Voice control[edit]\n\n\nUsers can give detailed voice commands to applications.[22] On-device machine processing is used to offer better navigation.[1]\n\n\n\n#### Sidecar[edit]\n\n\nSidecar allows a Mac to use an iPad (running iPadOS) as a wireless external display. With Apple Pencil, the device can also be used as a graphics tablet for software running on the computer.[13][23] Sidecar requires a Mac with Intel Skylake CPUs and newer (such as the fourth-generation MacBook Pro), and an iPad that supports Apple Pencil.[24][25]\n\n\n\n#### Support for wireless game controllers[edit]\n\n\nThe Game Controller framework adds support for two major console game controllers: the PlayStation 4's DualShock 4 and the Xbox One controller.[26][27][28][29]\n\n\n\n#### Time Machine[edit]\n\n\nA number of under-the-hood changes were made to Time Machine, the backup software. For example, the manner in which backup data is stored on network-attached devices was changed, and this change is not backwards-compatible with earlier versions of macOS.[30]\nApple declined to document these changes, but some of them have been noted.[30]\n\n\n\n### Applications[edit]\n\n\n#### iTunes[edit]\n\n\niTunes is replaced by separate Music, Podcasts, TV and Books apps, in line with iOS. iOS device management is now conducted via Finder.[31][32] The TV app on Mac supports Dolby Atmos, Dolby Vision, and HDR10 on MacBooks released in 2018 or later, while 4K HDR playback is supported on Macs released in 2018 or later when connected to a compatible display.[13]\n\n\n\n#### Find My[edit]\n\n\nFind My Mac and Find My Friends are merged into an application called Find My.\n\n\n\n#### Notes[edit]\n\n\nThe Notes application was enhanced to allow better management of checklists and the ability to share folders with other users. The application version was incremented from 4.6 (in macOS 10.14 Mojave) to 4.7.\n\n\n\n#### Reminders[edit]\n\n\nAmong other visual and functional overhauls, attachments can be added to reminders and Siri can intelligently estimate when to remind the user about an event.[1]\n\n\n\n#### Voice Memos[edit]\n\n\nThe Voice Memos application, first ported from iOS to the Mac in macOS 10.14 Mojave as version 2.0, was incremented to version 2.1.\n\n\n\n#### Removed or changed components[edit]\n\n\nmacOS Catalina exclusively supports 64-bit applications. 32-bit applications no longer run (including all software that utilizes the Carbon API as well as QuickTime 7 applications, image, audio and video codecs). Apple has also removed all 32-bit-only apps from the Mac App Store.[33]\n\n\nZ shell (executable \"zsh\") is the default login shell and interactive shell in macOS Catalina,[34] replacing Bash, the default shell since Mac OS X Panther in 2003.[35] Bash continues to be available in macOS Catalina, along with other shells such as csh/tcsh and ksh.\n\n\nDashboard has been removed in macOS Catalina.[36]\n\n\nThe ability to add Backgrounds in Photo Booth was removed in macOS Catalina.\n\n\nThe command-line interface GNU Emacs application was removed in macOS Catalina.\n\n\nBuilt-in support for Perl, Python 2.7 and Ruby are included in macOS for compatibility with legacy software.[37] Future versions of macOS will not include scripting language runtimes by default, possibly requiring users to install additional packages.[38]\n\n\nLegacy AirDrop for connecting with Macs running Mac OS X Lion, Mountain Lion and Mavericks, or 2011 and older Macs has been removed.[39]\n\n\n\n## Security[edit]\n\n\n*Ars Technica* reported that macOS Catalina contained a critical privilege escalation vulnerability, which resulted in a backdoor being installed if users visited a Hong Kong pro-democracy website. The vulnerability was reported to Apple in August 2021, and patched in a Catalina update in September, but it had already been patched by Apple in macOS Big Sur 11.2, released 234 days earlier on February 1. Security experts have criticized Apple for not patching critical known vulnerabilities in older versions, and for not being transparent about older versions only receiving some, but not all, security patches. The latest major release of Apple's operating systems (macOS, iOS, and others) receive all security updates.[40][41][42]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\nCatalina received favorable reviews on release for some of its features.[43] However, some critics found the OS version distinctly less reliable than earlier versions.[44][45][46][47][48] The broad addition of user-facing security measures (somewhat analogous to the addition of User Account Control dialog boxes with Windows Vista a decade earlier) was criticized as intrusive and annoying.[46][49]\n\n\n\n## Release

Mojave was announced at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference on June 4, 2018, and was released to the public on September 24, 2018. The operating system's name refers to the Mojave Desert, and is part of a series of California-themed names that began with OS X Mavericks.[4] It succeeded macOS High Sierra and was followed by macOS Catalina. macOS Mojave is the last version of macOS that features the iTunes and Dashboard apps.\n\n\nmacOS Mojave brings several iOS apps to the desktop operating system, including Apple News, Voice Memos, and Home. It also includes a more comprehensive \"dark mode\", is the final version of macOS to support 32-bit application software,[5][6] is the last version of the macOS capable of being booted from an HFS+ partition without third-party patching, and is also the last version of macOS to support the iPhoto app, which had already been superseded in OS X Yosemite (10.10) by the newer Photos app.\n\n\nMojave was well received and was supplemented by point releases after launch.\n\n\n\n\n## Overview[edit]\n\n\nmacOS Mojave was announced on June 4, 2018, at Apple's annual Worldwide Developers Conference in San Jose, California.[1][7][8] Apple pitched Mojave, named after the California desert, as adding \"pro\" features that would benefit all users. The developer preview of the operating system was released for developers the same day,[8] followed by a public beta on June 26.[9] The retail version of 10.14 was released on September 24, 2018.[10]\n\n\n\n## System requirements[edit]\n\n\nMojave requires a GPU that supports Metal, and the list of compatible systems is more restrictive than the previous version, macOS High Sierra.[11] Mojave drops support for various Macs released from late 2009 to 2011. Compatible models are the following Macintosh computers running OS X Mountain Lion or later:[12]\n\n\n\n* iMac (Late 2012 or later)\n* iMac Pro (2017)\n* MacBook (Early 2015 or later)\n* MacBook Air (Mid 2012 or later)\n* MacBook Pro (Mid 2012 or later)\n* Mac Mini (Late 2012 or later)\n* Mac Pro (2013, 2010–2012 supported with a Metal-capable graphics card)[13]\n\n\nmacOS Mojave requires at least 2 GB of RAM as well as 12.5 GB of available disk space to upgrade from OS X El Capitan, macOS Sierra, or macOS High Sierra, or 18.5 GB of disk space to upgrade from OS X Yosemite and earlier releases. Some features are not available on all compatible models.[14] Mojave installations convert the installation volume to Apple File System (APFS), if the volume had not previously been converted from HFS+.[15]\n\n\nIt is possible to install Mojave on many older Macintosh computers that are not officially supported by Apple. This requires using a patch to modify the install image.[16]\n\n\n\n## Changes[edit]\n\n\n### System updates[edit]\n\n\nmacOS Mojave deprecates support for several legacy features of the OS. The graphics frameworks OpenGL and OpenCL are still supported by the operating system, but will no longer be maintained; developers are encouraged to use Apple's Metal library instead.[17]\n\n\nOpenGL is a cross-platform graphics framework designed to support a wide range of processors. Apple chose OpenGL in the late 1990s to build support for software graphics rendering into the Mac, after abandoning QuickDraw 3D. At the time, moving to OpenGL allowed Apple to take advantage of existing libraries that enabled hardware acceleration on a variety of different GPUs. As time went on, Apple has shifted its efforts towards building its hardware platforms for mobile and desktop use. Metal makes use of the homogenized hardware by abandoning the abstraction layer and running on the \"bare metal\". Metal reduces CPU load, shifting more tasks to the GPU. It reduces driver overhead and improves multithreading, allowing every CPU thread to send commands to the GPU.[18]\n\n\nmacOS does not natively support Vulkan, the Khronos group's official successor to OpenGL. The MoltenVK library can be used as a bridge, translating most of the Vulkan 1.0 API into the Metal API.[19][20]\n\n\nContinuing the process started in macOS High Sierra (10.13), which issued warnings about compatibility with 32-bit applications, Mojave issues warnings when opening 32-bit apps that they will not be supported in future updates. In macOS Mojave 10.14, this alert appears once every 30 days when launching the app, as macOS 10.15 will not support 32-bit applications.[6]\n\n\nWhen Mojave is installed, it will convert solid-state drives (SSDs), hard disk drives (HDDs), and Fusion Drives, from HFS Plus to APFS. On Fusion Drives using APFS, files will be moved to the SSD based on the file's frequency of use and its SSD performance profile. APFS will also store all metadata for a Fusion Drive's file system on the SSD.[21]\n\n\nNew data protections require applications to get permission from the user before using the Mac camera and microphone or accessing system data like user Mail history and Messages database.[22]\n\n\n\n### Removed features[edit]\n\n\nMojave removes integration with Facebook, Twitter, Vimeo, and Flickr, which was added in OS X Mountain Lion.[23]\n\n\nMojave also removes support for sub-pixel rendering of text. The feature was previously used on non-Retina displays to improve the appearance of text on screen.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe only supported Nvidia graphics cards are the Quadro K5000 and GeForce GTX 680 Mac Edition.[24][25]\n\n\n\n## Applications[edit]\n\n\nMojave features changes to existing applications as well as new ones. Finder now has metadata preview accessed via View > Show Preview, and many other updates,[26] including a Gallery View (replacing Cover Flow) that lets users browse through files visually.[27] After a screenshot is taken, as with iOS, the image appears in the corner of the display. The screenshot software can now record video, choose where to save files, and be opened via `⇧ Shift` + `⌘ Command` + `5`.[28]\n\n\nSafari's Tracking Prevention features now prevent social media \"Like\" or \"Share\" buttons and comment widgets from tracking users without permission. The browser also sends less information to web servers about the user's system, reducing the chance of being tracked based on system configuration.[29] It can also automatically create, autofill, and store strong passwords when users create new online accounts; it also flags reused passwords so users can change them.[30]\n\n\nA new Screenshot app was added to macOS Mojave to replace the Grab app. Screenshot can capture a selected area, window or the entire screen as well as screen record a selected area or the entire display. The Screenshot app is located in the `/Applications/Utilities/` folder, as was the Grab app. Screenshot can also be accessed by pressing `⇧ Shift`+`⌘ Command`+`3`.\n\n\n\n### FaceTime[edit]\n\n\nmacOS 10.14.1, released on October 30, 2018, adds Group FaceTime, which lets users chat with up to 32 people at the same time, using video or audio from an iPhone, iPad or Mac, or audio from Apple Watch. Participants can join in mid-conversation.[31]\n\n\n\n### App Store[edit]\n\n\nThe Mac App Store was rewritten from the ground up and features a new interface and editorial content, similar to the iOS App Store. A new 'Discover' tab highlights new and updated apps; Create, Work, Play and Develop tabs help users find apps for a specific project or purpose.[32]\n\n\n\n### iOS apps ported to macOS[edit]\n\n\nFour new apps (News, Stocks, Voice Memos and Home) are ported to macOS Mojave from iOS, with Apple implementing a subset of UIKit on the desktop OS.[33] Third-party developers would be able to port iOS applications to macOS in 2019.[34]\n\n\nWith Home, Mac users can control their HomeKit-enabled accessories to do things like turn lights off and on or adjust thermostat settings. Voice Memos lets users record audio (e.g., personal notes, lectures, meetings, interviews, or song ideas), and access them from iPhone, iPad or Mac. Stocks delivers curated market news alongside a personalized watchlist, with quotes and charts.[35]\n\n\n\n## User interface[edit]\n\n\n### Dark mode and accent colors[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Light-on-dark color scheme\n\nMojave introduces \"Dark Mode\", a Light-on-dark color scheme that darkens the user interface to make content stand out while the interface recedes.[36] Users can choose dark or light mode when installing Mojave, or any time thereafter from System Preferences.[37]\n\n\nApple's built-in apps support Dark Mode.[37] App developers can implement Dark mode in their apps via a public API.[38]\n\n\nA limited dark mode that affected only the Dock, menu bar, and drop-down menus was previously introduced in OS X Yosemite.[5]\n\n\n\n### Desktop[edit]\n\n\nStacks, a feature introduced in Mac OS X Leopard, now lets users group desktop files into groups based on file attributes such as file kind, date last opened, date modified, date created, name and tags.[27][28] This is accessed via View > Use Stacks.[26]\n\n\nmacOS Mojave features a new Dynamic Desktop that automatically changes specially made desktop backgrounds (two of which are included)[39] to match the time of day.[40]\n\n\n\n### Dock[edit]\n\n\nThe Dock has a space for recently used apps that have not previously been added to the Dock.[26]\n\n\n\n### Preferences[edit]\n\n\nmacOS update functionality has been moved back to System Preferences from the Mac App Store.[26][41] In OS X Mountain Lion (10.8), system and app updates moved to the App Store from Software Update.[42]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\nMojave was generally well received by technology press. *The Verge*'s Jacob Kastrenakes considered Mojave a relatively minor update and typical of 2010s macOS releases,[43] but Kastrenakes and Jason Snell thought the release hinted at the future direction of macOS.[44] In contrast, *Ars Technica*'s Andrew Cunningham felt that \"Mojave feels, if not totally transformative, at least more *consequential* than the last few macOS releases have felt.\" Cunningham highlighted productivity improvements and continued work on macOS's foundation.[15] TechCrunch's Brian Heater dubbed Mojave \"arguably the most focused macOS release in recent memory\", playing an important role in reassuring professional users that it was still committed to them.[45]\n\n\nMojave's new features were generally praised. Critics welcomed the addition of Dark Mode,[46][37][47] although some noted that its effect was inconsistent; *MacWorld*'s Karen Haslam noted that it did not affect the bright white background in Pages, for instance.[48] Others noted that Dark Mode's utility was curtailed by the lack of third-party developer support at release.[43]\n\n\n\n## Release history[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Version\n | Build\n

Mojave was announced at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference on June 4, 2018, and was released to the public on September 24, 2018. The operating system's name refers to the Mojave Desert, and is part of a series of California-themed names that began with OS X Mavericks.[4] It succeeded macOS High Sierra and was followed by macOS Catalina. macOS Mojave is the last version of macOS that features the iTunes and Dashboard apps.\n\n\nmacOS Mojave brings several iOS apps to the desktop operating system, including Apple News, Voice Memos, and Home. It also includes a more comprehensive \"dark mode\", is the final version of macOS to support 32-bit application software,[5][6] is the last version of the macOS capable of being booted from an HFS+ partition without third-party patching, and is also the last version of macOS to support the iPhoto app, which had already been superseded in OS X Yosemite (10.10) by the newer Photos app.\n\n\nMojave was well received and was supplemented by point releases after launch.\n\n\n\n\n## Overview[edit]\n\n\nmacOS Mojave was announced on June 4, 2018, at Apple's annual Worldwide Developers Conference in San Jose, California.[1][7][8] Apple pitched Mojave, named after the California desert, as adding \"pro\" features that would benefit all users. The developer preview of the operating system was released for developers the same day,[8] followed by a public beta on June 26.[9] The retail version of 10.14 was released on September 24, 2018.[10]\n\n\n\n## System requirements[edit]\n\n\nMojave requires a GPU that supports Metal, and the list of compatible systems is more restrictive than the previous version, macOS High Sierra.[11] Mojave drops support for various Macs released from late 2009 to 2011. Compatible models are the following Macintosh computers running OS X Mountain Lion or later:[12]\n\n\n\n* iMac (Late 2012 or later)\n* iMac Pro (2017)\n* MacBook (Early 2015 or later)\n* MacBook Air (Mid 2012 or later)\n* MacBook Pro (Mid 2012 or later)\n* Mac Mini (Late 2012 or later)\n* Mac Pro (2013, 2010–2012 supported with a Metal-capable graphics card)[13]\n\n\nmacOS Mojave requires at least 2 GB of RAM as well as 12.5 GB of available disk space to upgrade from OS X El Capitan, macOS Sierra, or macOS High Sierra, or 18.5 GB of disk space to upgrade from OS X Yosemite and earlier releases. Some features are not available on all compatible models.[14] Mojave installations convert the installation volume to Apple File System (APFS), if the volume had not previously been converted from HFS+.[15]\n\n\nIt is possible to install Mojave on many older Macintosh computers that are not officially supported by Apple. This requires using a patch to modify the install image.[16]\n\n\n\n## Changes[edit]\n\n\n### System updates[edit]\n\n\nmacOS Mojave deprecates support for several legacy features of the OS. The graphics frameworks OpenGL and OpenCL are still supported by the operating system, but will no longer be maintained; developers are encouraged to use Apple's Metal library instead.[17]\n\n\nOpenGL is a cross-platform graphics framework designed to support a wide range of processors. Apple chose OpenGL in the late 1990s to build support for software graphics rendering into the Mac, after abandoning QuickDraw 3D. At the time, moving to OpenGL allowed Apple to take advantage of existing libraries that enabled hardware acceleration on a variety of different GPUs. As time went on, Apple has shifted its efforts towards building its hardware platforms for mobile and desktop use. Metal makes use of the homogenized hardware by abandoning the abstraction layer and running on the \"bare metal\". Metal reduces CPU load, shifting more tasks to the GPU. It reduces driver overhead and improves multithreading, allowing every CPU thread to send commands to the GPU.[18]\n\n\nmacOS does not natively support Vulkan, the Khronos group's official successor to OpenGL. The MoltenVK library can be used as a bridge, translating most of the Vulkan 1.0 API into the Metal API.[19][20]\n\n\nContinuing the process started in macOS High Sierra (10.13), which issued warnings about compatibility with 32-bit applications, Mojave issues warnings when opening 32-bit apps that they will not be supported in future updates. In macOS Mojave 10.14, this alert appears once every 30 days when launching the app, as macOS 10.15 will not support 32-bit applications.[6]\n\n\nWhen Mojave is installed, it will convert solid-state drives (SSDs), hard disk drives (HDDs), and Fusion Drives, from HFS Plus to APFS. On Fusion Drives using APFS, files will be moved to the SSD based on the file's frequency of use and its SSD performance profile. APFS will also store all metadata for a Fusion Drive's file system on the SSD.[21]\n\n\nNew data protections require applications to get permission from the user before using the Mac camera and microphone or accessing system data like user Mail history and Messages database.[22]\n\n\n\n### Removed features[edit]\n\n\nMojave removes integration with Facebook, Twitter, Vimeo, and Flickr, which was added in OS X Mountain Lion.[23]\n\n\nMojave also removes support for sub-pixel rendering of text. The feature was previously used on non-Retina displays to improve the appearance of text on screen.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe only supported Nvidia graphics cards are the Quadro K5000 and GeForce GTX 680 Mac Edition.[24][25]\n\n\n\n## Applications[edit]\n\n\nMojave features changes to existing applications as well as new ones. Finder now has metadata preview accessed via View > Show Preview, and many other updates,[26] including a Gallery View (replacing Cover Flow) that lets users browse through files visually.[27] After a screenshot is taken, as with iOS, the image appears in the corner of the display. The screenshot software can now record video, choose where to save files, and be opened via `⇧ Shift` + `⌘ Command` + `5`.[28]\n\n\nSafari's Tracking Prevention features now prevent social media \"Like\" or \"Share\" buttons and comment widgets from tracking users without permission. The browser also sends less information to web servers about the user's system, reducing the chance of being tracked based on system configuration.[29] It can also automatically create, autofill, and store strong passwords when users create new online accounts; it also flags reused passwords so users can change them.[30]\n\n\nA new Screenshot app was added to macOS Mojave to replace the Grab app. Screenshot can capture a selected area, window or the entire screen as well as screen record a selected area or the entire display. The Screenshot app is located in the `/Applications/Utilities/` folder, as was the Grab app. Screenshot can also be accessed by pressing `⇧ Shift`+`⌘ Command`+`3`.\n\n\n\n### FaceTime[edit]\n\n\nmacOS 10.14.1, released on October 30, 2018, adds Group FaceTime, which lets users chat with up to 32 people at the same time, using video or audio from an iPhone, iPad or Mac, or audio from Apple Watch. Participants can join in mid-conversation.[31]\n\n\n\n### App Store[edit]\n\n\nThe Mac App Store was rewritten from the ground up and features a new interface and editorial content, similar to the iOS App Store. A new 'Discover' tab highlights new and updated apps; Create, Work, Play and Develop tabs help users find apps for a specific project or purpose.[32]\n\n\n\n### iOS apps ported to macOS[edit]\n\n\nFour new apps (News, Stocks, Voice Memos and Home) are ported to macOS Mojave from iOS, with Apple implementing a subset of UIKit on the desktop OS.[33] Third-party developers would be able to port iOS applications to macOS in 2019.[34]\n\n\nWith Home, Mac users can control their HomeKit-enabled accessories to do things like turn lights off and on or adjust thermostat settings. Voice Memos lets users record audio (e.g., personal notes, lectures, meetings, interviews, or song ideas), and access them from iPhone, iPad or Mac. Stocks delivers curated market news alongside a personalized watchlist, with quotes and charts.[35]\n\n\n\n## User interface[edit]\n\n\n### Dark mode and accent colors[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Light-on-dark color scheme\n\nMojave introduces \"Dark Mode\", a Light-on-dark color scheme that darkens the user interface to make content stand out while the interface recedes.[36] Users can choose dark or light mode when installing Mojave, or any time thereafter from System Preferences.[37]\n\n\nApple's built-in apps support Dark Mode.[37] App developers can implement Dark mode in their apps via a public API.[38]\n\n\nA limited dark mode that affected only the Dock, menu bar, and drop-down menus was previously introduced in OS X Yosemite.[5]\n\n\n\n### Desktop[edit]\n\n\nStacks, a feature introduced in Mac OS X Leopard, now lets users group desktop files into groups based on file attributes such as file kind, date last opened, date modified, date created, name and tags.[27][28] This is accessed via View > Use Stacks.[26]\n\n\nmacOS Mojave features a new Dynamic Desktop that automatically changes specially made desktop backgrounds (two of which are included)[39] to match the time of day.[40]\n\n\n\n### Dock[edit]\n\n\nThe Dock has a space for recently used apps that have not previously been added to the Dock.[26]\n\n\n\n### Preferences[edit]\n\n\nmacOS update functionality has been moved back to System Preferences from the Mac App Store.[26][41] In OS X Mountain Lion (10.8), system and app updates moved to the App Store from Software Update.[42]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\nMojave was generally well received by technology press. *The Verge*'s Jacob Kastrenakes considered Mojave a relatively minor update and typical of 2010s macOS releases,[43] but Kastrenakes and Jason Snell thought the release hinted at the future direction of macOS.[44] In contrast, *Ars Technica*'s Andrew Cunningham felt that \"Mojave feels, if not totally transformative, at least more *consequential* than the last few macOS releases have felt.\" Cunningham highlighted productivity improvements and continued work on macOS's foundation.[15] TechCrunch's Brian Heater dubbed Mojave \"arguably the most focused macOS release in recent memory\", playing an important role in reassuring professional users that it was still committed to them.[45]\n\n\nMojave's new features were generally praised.
