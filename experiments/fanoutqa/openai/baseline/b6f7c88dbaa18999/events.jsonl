In the conference semifinals, they defeated the 4th seeded Phoenix Suns in six games to advance to the Western Conference Finals for the second time in four years. The Nuggets made the Finals for the first time in history by sweeping the 7th seeded Los Angeles Lakers in the Conference Finals to advance to the 2023 NBA Finals.\n\n\nOn June 12, 2023, Denver won their first championship in franchise history after a 94–89 win against the Miami Heat, defeating them in 5 games. They joined the San Antonio Spurs as the only former ABA franchises to win a championship in the NBA, although neither team had won a title in the old league.\n\n\n\n\n## Draft[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2022 NBA draft\n\n\n\n| Round\n | Pick\n | Player\n | Position(s)\n | Nationality\n | College / Club\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | 21\n | Christian Braun | SG\n | ![](image) United States\n | Kansas |\n\n\nThe Nuggets own their first round pick;[2] their second-round pick was traded to Minnesota via Philadelphia.\n\n\n\n## Roster[edit]\n\n\n\n\n2022–23 Denver Nuggets roster\n| Players\n | Coaches\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| \n\n| Pos. | No. | Name\n | Height\n | Weight\n | DOB\n | From\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| G | 0 | Braun, Christian | 6 ft 6 in (1.98 m)\n | 220 lb (100 kg)\n | 2001-04-17\n | Kansas |\n| G | 11 | Brown, Bruce | 6 ft 4 in (1.93 m)\n | 202 lb (92 kg)\n | 1996-08-15\n | Miami (FL) |\n| C | 13 | Bryant, Thomas | 6 ft 10 in (2.08 m)\n | 248 lb (112 kg)\n | 1997-07-31\n | Indiana |\n| G | 5 | Caldwell-Pope, Kentavious | 6 ft 5 in (1.96 m)\n | 204 lb (93 kg)\n | 1993-02-18\n | Georgia |\n| F | 31 | Čančar, Vlatko | 6 ft 8 in (2.03 m)\n | 236 lb (107 kg)\n | 1997-04-10\n | Slovenia |\n| G | 21 | Gillespie, Collin ![Injured](image) (TW)\n | 6 ft 1 in (1.85 m)\n | 195 lb (88 kg)\n | 1999-06-25\n | Villanova |\n| F | 50 | Gordon, Aaron | 6 ft 9 in (2.06 m)\n | 235 lb (107 kg)\n | 1995-09-16\n | Arizona |\n| F | 32 | Green, Jeff | 6 ft 8 in (2.03 m)\n | 235 lb (107 kg)\n | 1986-08-28\n | Georgetown |\n| G | 7 | Jackson, Reggie | 6 ft 2 in (1.88 m)\n | 208 lb (94 kg)\n | 1990-04-16\n | Boston College |\n| C | 15 | Jokić, Nikola (C)\n | 7 ft 0 in (2.13 m)\n | 284 lb (129 kg)\n | 1995-02-19\n | Serbia |\n| C | 6 | Jordan, DeAndre | 6 ft 11 in (2.11 m)\n | 265 lb (120 kg)\n | 1988-07-21\n | Texas A&M |\n| G | 27 | Murray, Jamal (C)\n | 6 ft 4 in (1.93 m)\n | 215 lb (98 kg)\n | 1997-02-23\n | Kentucky |\n| F/C | 22 | Nnaji, Zeke | 6 ft 11 in (2.11 m)\n | 240 lb (109 kg)\n | 2001-01-09\n | Arizona |\n| F | 1 | Porter, Michael Jr. | 6 ft 10 in (2.08 m)\n | 218 lb (99 kg)\n | 1998-06-29\n | Missouri |\n| G | 14 | Smith, Ish | 6 ft 0 in (1.83 m)\n | 175 lb (79 kg)\n | 1988-07-05\n | Wake Forest |\n| G/F | 8 | Watson, Peyton | 6 ft 7 in (2.01 m)\n | 200 lb (91 kg)\n | 2002-09-11\n | UCLA |\n| F | 10 | White, Jack (TW)\n | 6 ft 7 in (2.01 m)\n | 225 lb (102 kg)\n | 1997-08-05\n | Duke |\n\n | Head coach* Michael Malone\n\nAssistant coach(es)* David Adelman\n* John Beckett\n* Ryan Bowen\n* Popeye Jones\n* Charles Klask\n* Ryan Saunders\n* Ognjen Stojaković\n* Elvis Valcarcel\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nLegend\n* **(DP)** Unsigned draft pick\n* **(FA)** Free agent\n* **(S)** Suspended\n* **(GL)** On assignment to G League\n* **(TW)** Two-way affiliate player\n* ![Injured](image) Injured\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nRoster  Last transaction: February 14, 2023\n |\n\n\n## Standings[edit]\n\n\n### Division[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Northwest Division | W | L | PCT | GB | Home | Road | Div | GP |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **c** – Denver Nuggets | 53 | 29 | .646 | – | 34‍–‍7 | 19‍–‍22 | 10–6 | 82 |\n| **x** – Minnesota Timberwolves | 42 | 40 | .512 | 11.0 | 22‍–‍19 | 20‍–‍21 | 8–8 | 82 |\n| **pi** – Oklahoma City Thunder | 40 | 42 | .488 | 13.0 | 24‍–‍17 | 16‍–‍25 | 9–7 | 82 |\n| Utah Jazz | 37 | 45 | .451 | 16.0 | 23‍–‍18 | 14‍–‍27 | 6–10 | 82 |\n| Portland Trail Blazers | 33 | 49 | .402 | 20.0 | 17‍–‍24 | 16‍–‍25 | 7–9 | 82 |\n\n\n### Conference[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Western Conference |\n| --- |\n| # | Team | W | L | PCT | GB | GP |\n| 1 | **c** – Denver Nuggets \\* | 53 | 29 | .646 | – | 82 |\n| 2 | **y** – Memphis Grizzlies \\* | 51 | 31 | .622 | 2.0 | 82 |\n| 3 | **y** – Sacramento Kings \\* | 48 | 34 | .585 | 5.0 | 82 |\n| 4 | **x** – Phoenix Suns | 45 | 37 | .549 | 8.0 | 82 |\n| 5 | **x** – Los Angeles Clippers | 44 | 38 | .537 | 9.0 | 82 |\n| 6 | **x** – Golden State Warriors | 44 | 38 | .537 | 9.0 | 82 |\n|  |\n| 7 | **x** – Los Angeles Lakers | 43 | 39 | .524 | 10.0 | 82 |\n| 8 | **x** – Minnesota Timberwolves | 42 | 40 | .512 | 11.0 | 82 |\n| 9 | **pi** – New Orleans Pelicans | 42 | 40 | .512 | 11.0 | 82 |\n| 10 | **pi** – Oklahoma City Thunder | 40 | 42 | .488 | 13.0 | 82 |\n|  |\n| 11 | Dallas Mavericks | 38 | 44 | .463 | 15.0 | 82 |\n| 12 | Utah Jazz | 37 | 45 | .451 | 16.0 | 82 |\n| 13 | Portland Trail Blazers | 33 | 49 | .402 | 20.0 | 82 |\n| 14 | Houston Rockets | 22 | 60 | .268 | 31.0 | 82 |\n| 15 | San Antonio Spurs | 22 | 60 | .268 | 31.0 | 82 |\n\n\n## Game log[edit]\n\n\n### Preseason[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2022 preseason game logTotal: 3–2 (Home: 1–1;

After failing to make the playoffs the previous two seasons, the Warriors beat the Boston Celtics 4–2 in the Finals. It was the Warriors' fourth championship in eight years (2015, 2017, 2018), and seventh overall.\n\n\nOn December 14, Stephen Curry hit five three-pointers against the New York Knicks to reach 2,977, which surpassed Ray Allen's career total of 2,973 for most three-pointers made in NBA history in the regular season.[1] Earlier in the season against the Chicago Bulls, Curry hit nine three-pointers to reach 3,366 which broke Allen's record of 3,358 for most three-pointers made in NBA history, regular season, and postseason combined.[2] Curry also became the first player in NBA history to surpass 500 three-pointers in the playoffs, finishing with 561.\n\n\nOn January 9, Klay Thompson made his season debut against the Cleveland Cavaliers after missing the 2019–20 season with a left ACL tear, and the 2020–21 season with a right Achilles tendon tear. He recorded 17 points and 3 rebounds in a 96–82 win.[3]\n\n\nStephen Curry, Andrew Wiggins, and Draymond Green were named to the 2022 NBA All-Star Game; however, Green was injured and did not play in the game. On February 20, Team LeBron defeated Team Durant in the All-Star Game and Curry, playing for Team LeBron, was named the All-Star Game MVP. This is the fifth time that a Warriors player has won the award. He scored 50 points, and set numerous All-Star Game records, including most three-pointers made (16), and most all-time three-pointers made in the All-Star Game (47).[4]\n\n\nThe Warriors had a 41–13 record in February, then went 7–16 in an injury-plagued stretch of 23 games, and then won the final 5 games of the season. They clinched a playoff berth for the first time since 2018–19 season after a 111–107 win over the Utah Jazz on April 2.[5] They finished third in the Western Conference, with a record of 53–29. In the first round of the playoffs, the Warriors defeated the Denver Nuggets in five games.[6] In the second round, the Warriors upset the second-seed Memphis Grizzlies in six games.[7] They went on to defeat the Dallas Mavericks in five games, winning the Western Conference for the seventh time in their history, and the sixth time in the last eight years. The last team to win six championships in eight years was the 1990–98 Chicago Bulls in the Eastern Conference.[8] The Warriors under Steve Kerr have never lost a Western Conference playoff series, going 18–0 during this span, tied with the 1959–67 Boston Celtics for the longest playoff winning streak in NBA history against their conference opponents.[9] Golden State met the Boston Celtics in the NBA Finals in a rematch of the 1964 Finals, in which the Celtics defeated the then–San Francisco Warriors in five games. The Warriors defeated the Celtics four games to two to win their fourth championship in eight years, seventh overall, and first since 2018. After the series, many analysts claimed that the Warriors were one of the greatest dynasties in NBA history.[10] During the championship run, the Warriors won at least one road game in all four playoff series, thus extending their NBA record for consecutives playoff series with at least one road win at 27. However, this streak came to an end in 2023 against the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\n\n\n\n## Draft[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2021 NBA draft\n\n\n\n| Round\n | Pick\n | Player\n | Position\n | Nationality\n | School / club team\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | 7\n | Jonathan Kuminga | SF\n | ![Democratic Republic of the Congo](image) DR Congo\n | NBA G League Ignite |\n| 1\n | 14\n | Moses Moody | SG\n | ![United States](image) United States\n | Arkansas (Fr.) |\n\n\nThe Warriors had two first-round picks entering the draft.[11] The seventh pick was given from the Timberwolves following the Andrew Wiggins trade from the 2019–20 season.[12]\n\n\n\n## Standings[edit]\n\n\n### Division[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Pacific Division | W | L | PCT | GB | Home | Road | Div | GP |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **z** – Phoenix Suns | 64 | 18 | .780 | – | 32‍–‍9 | 32‍–‍9 | 10–6 | 82 |\n| **x** – Golden State Warriors | 53 | 29 | .646 | 11.0 | 31‍–‍10 | 22‍–‍19 | 12–4 | 82 |\n| **pi** – Los Angeles Clippers | 42 | 40 | .512 | 22.0 | 25‍–‍16 | 17‍–‍24 | 9–7 | 82 |\n| Los Angeles Lakers | 33 | 49 | .402 | 31.0 | 21‍–‍20 | 12‍–‍29 | 3–13 | 82 |\n| Sacramento Kings | 30 | 52 | .366 | 34.0 | 16‍–‍25 | 14‍–‍27 | 6–10 | 82 |\n\n\n### Conference[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Western Conference |\n| --- |\n| #

After failing to make the playoffs the previous two seasons, the Warriors beat the Boston Celtics 4–2 in the Finals. It was the Warriors' fourth championship in eight years (2015, 2017, 2018), and seventh overall.\n\n\nOn December 14, Stephen Curry hit five three-pointers against the New York Knicks to reach 2,977, which surpassed Ray Allen's career total of 2,973 for most three-pointers made in NBA history in the regular season.[1] Earlier in the season against the Chicago Bulls, Curry hit nine three-pointers to reach 3,366 which broke Allen's record of 3,358 for most three-pointers made in NBA history, regular season, and postseason combined.[2] Curry also became the first player in NBA history to surpass 500 three-pointers in the playoffs, finishing with 561.\n\n\nOn January 9, Klay Thompson made his season debut against the Cleveland Cavaliers after missing the 2019–20 season with a left ACL tear, and the 2020–21 season with a right Achilles tendon tear. He recorded 17 points and 3 rebounds in a 96–82 win.[3]\n\n\nStephen Curry, Andrew Wiggins, and Draymond Green were named to the 2022 NBA All-Star Game; however, Green was injured and did not play in the game. On February 20, Team LeBron defeated Team Durant in the All-Star Game and Curry, playing for Team LeBron, was named the All-Star Game MVP. This is the fifth time that a Warriors player has won the award. He scored 50 points, and set numerous All-Star Game records, including most three-pointers made (16), and most all-time three-pointers made in the All-Star Game (47).[4]\n\n\nThe Warriors had a 41–13 record in February, then went 7–16 in an injury-plagued stretch of 23 games, and then won the final 5 games of the season. They clinched a playoff berth for the first time since 2018–19 season after a 111–107 win over the Utah Jazz on April 2.[5] They finished third in the Western Conference, with a record of 53–29. In the first round of the playoffs, the Warriors defeated the Denver Nuggets in five games.[6] In the second round, the Warriors upset the second-seed Memphis Grizzlies in six games.[7] They went on to defeat the Dallas Mavericks in five games, winning the Western Conference for the seventh time in their history, and the sixth time in the last eight years. The last team to win six championships in eight years was the 1990–98 Chicago Bulls in the Eastern Conference.[8] The Warriors under Steve Kerr have never lost a Western Conference playoff series, going 18–0 during this span, tied with the 1959–67 Boston Celtics for the longest playoff winning streak in NBA history against their conference opponents.[9] Golden State met the Boston Celtics in the NBA Finals in a rematch of the 1964 Finals, in which the Celtics defeated the then–San Francisco Warriors in five games. The Warriors defeated the Celtics four games to two to win their fourth championship in eight years, seventh overall, and first since 2018. After the series, many analysts claimed that the Warriors were one of the greatest dynasties in NBA history.[10] During the championship run, the Warriors won at least one road game in all four playoff series, thus extending their NBA record for consecutives playoff series with at least one road win at 27. However, this streak came to an end in 2023 against the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\n\n\n\n## Draft[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2021 NBA draft\n\n\n\n| Round\n | Pick\n | Player\n | Position\n | Nationality\n | School / club team\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | 7\n | Jonathan Kuminga | SF\n | ![Democratic Republic of the Congo](image) DR Congo\n | NBA G League Ignite |\n| 1\n | 14\n | Moses Moody | SG\n | ![United States](image) United States\n | Arkansas (Fr.) |\n\n\nThe Warriors had two first-round picks entering the draft.[11] The seventh pick was given from the Timberwolves following the Andrew Wiggins trade from the 2019–20 season.[12]\n\n\n\n## Standings[edit]\n\n\n### Division[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Pacific Division | W | L | PCT | GB | Home | Road | Div | GP |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **z** – Phoenix Suns | 64 | 18 | .780 | – | 32‍–‍9 | 32‍–‍9 | 10–6 | 82 |\n| **x** – Golden State Warriors | 53 | 29 | .646 | 11.0 | 31‍–‍10 | 22‍–‍19 | 12–4 | 82 |\n| **pi** – Los Angeles Clippers | 42 | 40 | .512 | 22.0 | 25‍–‍16 | 17‍–‍24 | 9–7 | 82 |\n| Los Angeles Lakers | 33 | 49 | .402 | 31.0 | 21‍–‍20 | 12‍–‍29 | 3–13 | 82 |\n| Sacramento Kings | 30 | 52 | .366 | 34.0 | 16‍–‍25 | 14‍–‍27 | 6–10 | 82 |\n\n\n### Conference[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Western Conference |\n| --- |\n| #

On April 30, 2021, the Bucks clinched the Central Division for a record 10th time with a win over the Chicago Bulls. The Bucks finished the season with a 46–26 record (equal to 51 wins in an 82-game season), good enough for the third seed. The Bucks began their playoff run by sweeping the sixth-seeded Miami Heat in the opening round, in a rematch of the Eastern Conference Semi-finals the previous year. The Bucks then defeated the second-seeded Brooklyn Nets in the Eastern Conference Semi-finals in seven games. In the Eastern Conference Finals, the Bucks defeated the Atlanta Hawks in six games, reaching the NBA Finals for the first time in 47 years, and winning the Eastern Conference Finals for the first time in franchise history.[1] The Bucks are the first NBA team to have won both a Western Conference and Eastern Conference championship in their history, as they were in the Western Conference when they reached the NBA Finals in 1971 and 1974. The Bucks would face the Phoenix Suns in the NBA Finals. Despite losing the first two games, the Bucks won four straight, winning 4–2 and clinching their second NBA title, the first since 1971.[2]\n\n\n\n\n## Draft picks[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2020 NBA draft\n\n\n\n| Round\n | Pick\n | Player\n | Position(s)\n | Nationality\n | School\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | 24\n | R.

J. Wilson, and Ersan İlyasova.[6][7][8] The trade unraveled when the NBA announced they were investigating the Bucks for having contact with Bogdanović and/or his agent before it was allowed under free agency rules. The Bucks reportedly felt double-crossed by the situation, and decided not to pursue the trade further. The league voided the team's second-round pick in 2022 at the conclusion of the investigation in December.[9][10] According to Bogdanović, he was not aware of the trade and felt betrayed by the Kings.[11] DiVincenzo and Wilson stayed with the Bucks and İlyasova was eventually waived. Bogdanović would sign with the Atlanta Hawks as a restricted free agent, after the Kings extended his qualifying offer.[12][13] Coincidentally, the Kings and Bucks would be able to make a successful trade during the following season, where the Kings successfully acquired DiVincenzo in a four-team trade.\n\n\n\n### Free agency[edit]\n\n\n#### Re-signed[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Player\n | Signed\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Pat Connaughton[14] | November 24\n |\n\n\n#### Additions[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Player\n | Signed\n | Former Team\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Jaylen Adams[15] | November 24\n | Portland Trail Blazers |\n| Mamadi Diakite[15] | November 24\n | Virginia |\n| Torrey Craig[16] | November 26\n | Denver Nuggets |\n| Bryn Forbes[16] | November 26\n | San Antonio Spurs |\n| Bobby Portis[16] | November 26\n | New York Knicks |\n| D.

On April 30, 2021, the Bucks clinched the Central Division for a record 10th time with a win over the Chicago Bulls. The Bucks finished the season with a 46–26 record (equal to 51 wins in an 82-game season), good enough for the third seed. The Bucks began their playoff run by sweeping the sixth-seeded Miami Heat in the opening round, in a rematch of the Eastern Conference Semi-finals the previous year. The Bucks then defeated the second-seeded Brooklyn Nets in the Eastern Conference Semi-finals in seven games. In the Eastern Conference Finals, the Bucks defeated the Atlanta Hawks in six games, reaching the NBA Finals for the first time in 47 years, and winning the Eastern Conference Finals for the first time in franchise history.[1] The Bucks are the first NBA team to have won both a Western Conference and Eastern Conference championship in their history, as they were in the Western Conference when they reached the NBA Finals in 1971 and 1974. The Bucks would face the Phoenix Suns in the NBA Finals.

J. Wilson, and Ersan İlyasova.[6][7][8] The trade unraveled when the NBA announced they were investigating the Bucks for having contact with Bogdanović and/or his agent before it was allowed under free agency rules. The Bucks reportedly felt double-crossed by the situation, and decided not to pursue the trade further. The league voided the team's second-round pick in 2022 at the conclusion of the investigation in December.[9][10] According to Bogdanović, he was not aware of the trade and felt betrayed by the Kings.[11] DiVincenzo and Wilson stayed with the Bucks and İlyasova was eventually waived. Bogdanović would sign with the Atlanta Hawks as a restricted free agent, after the Kings extended his qualifying offer.[12][13] Coincidentally, the Kings and Bucks would be able to make a successful trade during the following season, where the Kings successfully acquired DiVincenzo in a four-team trade.\n\n\n\n### Free agency[edit]\n\n\n#### Re-signed[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Player\n | Signed\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Pat Connaughton[14] | November 24\n |\n\n\n#### Additions[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Player\n | Signed\n | Former Team\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Jaylen Adams[15] | November 24\n | Portland Trail Blazers |\n| Mamadi Diakite[15] | November 24\n | Virginia |\n| Torrey Craig[16] | November 26\n | Denver Nuggets |\n| Bryn Forbes[16] | November 26\n | San Antonio Spurs |\n| Bobby Portis[16] | November 26\n | New York Knicks |\n| D.

The Lakers were coached by Frank Vogel in his first year as team head coach. The Lakers played their home games at Staples Center as members of the Western Conference's Pacific Division. The Lakers had the third best team defensive rating in the NBA.[1]\n\n\nOn March 6, 2020, the Lakers clinched their first playoff berth since the 2012–13 season. Five days later, due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the season was suspended.[2] On July 5, the NBA announced a return of the season in the NBA Bubble, with 22 teams playing 8 seeding games followed by a full postseason.[3] Play resumed on July 30 with all games being played in Orlando, Florida,[4] and on August 3, the Lakers clinched both their first Pacific Division title since 2012 and the top seed in the Western Conference playoffs for the first time since the 2009–10 season.\n\n\nThe Lakers finished the season 52–19, with a winning percentage equal to 60 games in a full 82-game season. They defeated the Portland Trail Blazers, Houston Rockets, and Denver Nuggets each in five games to advance to the NBA Finals for the first time since 2010. There they defeated the Miami Heat (LeBron James' former team) in six games to earn the franchise's 17th NBA championship, tying them with the Boston Celtics for the most of any NBA franchise. The team dedicated the season and the Finals win to Kobe Bryant, who was killed in a helicopter crash on January 26, 2020.\n\n\n\n\n## Previous season[edit]\n\n\nThe Lakers finished the 2018–19 season 37–45 to finish in fourth place in the Pacific Division and failing to qualify for the playoffs for the sixth consecutive year. Following the season, Magic Johnson stepped down as president of basketball operations. On April 12, 2019, head coach Luke Walton and the team agreed to part ways. On May 11, the Lakers hired Frank Vogel as head coach. The season marked the first time since 2005 that LeBron James did not appear in the playoffs and first time since 2010 that he missed the Finals.\n\n\n\n## Offseason[edit]\n\n\n### Front office and coaching changes[edit]\n\n\nOn April 9, 2019, Magic Johnson stepped down as president of basketball operations.[5] Three days after that, Luke Walton and the team agreed to part ways.[6] On May 13, the team hired Frank Vogel as their new head coach[7] and Jason Kidd was named an assistant coach.[8]\n\n\n\n### Draft[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2019 NBA draft\n\n\n\n| Round\n | Pick\n | Player\n | Position\n | Nationality\n | School / Club team\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | 4\n | De'Andre Hunter | SF\n | American\n | Virginia |\n\n\nThe Lakers held one first round draft pick for the 2019 NBA Draft.[9][10] They previously held the rights to two second rounders in this year's draft as well, but those selections were later traded to the Philadelphia 76ers and Atlanta Hawks as picks 34 and 41, respectively.[11][12] On the night of the NBA draft lottery, the Lakers rose up seven spots from the projected 11th selection to the 4th pick of the draft.[13] On June 15, the Lakers agreed to a trade that would send players Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball, and Josh Hart, and multiple draft picks, including the Lakers' 2019 1st round draft pick, to the New Orleans Pelicans in exchange for Anthony Davis. However, the trade was not finalized until July 6, during which time, the Washington Wizards were included in the deal as well.[14]\n\n\n\n### Trades[edit]\n\n\nOn June 15, 2019, the Lakers agreed to a trade with the New Orleans Pelicans to acquire six-time NBA All-Star power forward Anthony Davis, though the deal would not take full effect until July 6.[14] In exchange for Davis, the Lakers agreed to give up forward Brandon Ingram, guards Lonzo Ball and Josh Hart, three first-round picks (including their No. 4 overall selection in 2019), and a first-round pick swap in 2023.\n\n\nOn June 27, the Washington Wizards joined the trade to get Moritz Wagner, Isaac Bonga, Jemerrio Jones, and the Lakers' 2022 second-round pick in exchange for cash considerations.[15]\n\n\n\n### Free agents[edit]\n\n\nDuring the offseason, the Lakers were able to re-sign G Rajon Rondo, G Alex Caruso, G/F Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and C JaVale McGee.

James would take Davis with the No. 1 pick in the All-Star draft. Additionally, Vogel was also selected to coach Team LeBron in the All-Star Game. Team LeBron would go on to win 157–155, with Davis hitting a game-winning free throw.\n\n\nBy adding Davis, the Lakers got off to a fast start to the season, which included a 17–2 record by the end of November. Four months later, they were able to clinch their first playoff berth since the 2012–13 season with a win over the Milwaukee Bucks on March 6.\n\n\nHowever, five days after clinching their playoff berth, the NBA season was abruptly suspended by league officials [19] after it was reported that Rudy Gobert of the Utah Jazz tested positive for COVID-19.[20] Two unidentified players of the Lakers would later test positive for COVID-19 on March 19.[21] The season resumed, but Avery Bradley opted out of playing in the restart to remain with his family due to his oldest child, who had a history of struggling to recover from respiratory illnesses.[22] The Lakers replaced him on the roster with J. R. Smith, reuniting him with LeBron whom he won a championship with in 2016 with the Cleveland Cavaliers.[23]\n\n\n\n### Death of Kobe Bryant[edit]\n\n\nOn January 26, 2020, tragedy struck the Lakers organization when former All-Star guard Kobe Bryant died in a helicopter crash that also claimed the lives of his daughter Gianna \"Gigi\" Bryant and seven other passengers. Bryant was 41 at the time of his death, and Gigi was 13. This prompted the Lakers to dedicate the rest of their season to his memory.[24][25][26][27]\n\n\n\n## Playoffs[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: 2020 NBA playoffs\n\n### Game log[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2020 playoff game logTotal: 16–5 (Home: 9–3; Road: 7–2)\n |\n| --- |\n| First Round: 4–1 (home: 2–1; road: 2–0)\n\n| Game | Date | Team | Score | High points | High rebounds | High assists | LocationAttendance | Series\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | August 18\n | Portland | L 93–100  | Anthony Davis (28)\n | LeBron James (17)\n | LeBron James (16)\n | The ArenaNo In-Person Attendance\n | 0–1\n |\n| 2\n | August 20\n | Portland\n | W 111–88  | Anthony Davis (31)\n | Anthony Davis (11)\n | LeBron James (7)\n | The ArenaNo In-Person Attendance\n | 1–1\n |\n| 3\n | August 22\n | @ Portland\n | W 116–108  | LeBron James (38)\n | LeBron James (12)\n | Davis, James (8)\n | AdventHealth ArenaNo In-Person Attendance\n | 2–1\n |\n| 4\n | August 24\n | @ Portland\n | W 135–115  | LeBron James (30)\n | Howard, McGee (8)\n | LeBron James (10)\n | The ArenaNo In-Person Attendance\n | 3–1\n |\n| 5\n | August 29†\n | Portland\n | W 131–122  | Anthony Davis (43)\n | LeBron James (10)\n | LeBron James (10)\n | The ArenaNo In-Person Attendance\n | 4–1\n |\n |\n| Conference Semifinals: 4–1 (home: 2–1; road: 2–0)\n\n| Game | Date | Team | Score | High points | High rebounds | High assists | LocationAttendance | Series\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | September 4\n | Houston | L 97–112  | Anthony Davis (25)\n | Anthony Davis (14)\n | LeBron James (7)\n | The ArenaNo In-Person Attendance\n | 0–1\n |\n| 2\n | September 6\n | Houston\n | W 117–109  | Anthony Davis (34)\n | LeBron James (11)\n | James, Rondo (9)\n | The ArenaNo In-Person Attendance\n | 1–1\n |\n| 3\n | September 8\n | @ Houston\n | W 112–102  | LeBron James (36)\n | Anthony Davis (15)\n | Rajon Rondo (9)\n | The ArenaNo In-Person Attendance\n | 2–1\n |\n| 4\n | September 10\n | @ Houston\n | W 110–100  | Anthony Davis (29)\n | LeBron James (15)\n | LeBron James (9)\n | The ArenaNo In-Person Attendance\n | 3–1\n |\n| 5\n | September 12\n | Houston\n | W 119–96  | LeBron James (29)\n | Davis, James (11)\n | LeBron James (7)\n | The ArenaNo In-Person Attendance\n | 4–1\n |\n |\n| Conference Finals: 4–1 (home: 3–0; road: 1–1)\n\n| Game | Date | Team | Score | High points | High rebounds | High assists | LocationAttendance | Series\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | September 18\n | Denver | W 126–114  | Anthony Davis (37)\n | Anthony Davis (10)\n | LeBron James (12)\n | The ArenaNo In-Person Attendance\n | 1–0\n |\n| 2\n | September 20\n | Denver\n | W 105–103  | Anthony Davis (31)\n | LeBron James (11)\n | Rajon Rondo (9)\n | The ArenaNo In-Person Attendance\n | 2–0\n |\n| 3\n | September 22\n | @ Denver\n | L 106–114  | LeBron James (30)\n | LeBron James (10)\n | LeBron James (11)\n | The ArenaNo In-Person Attendance\n | 2–1\n |\n| 4\n | September 24\n | @ Denver\n | W 114–108  | Anthony Davis (34)\n | Dwight Howard (11)\n | LeBron James (8)\n | The ArenaNo In-Person Attendance\n | 3–1\n |\n| 5\n | September 26\n | Denver\n | W 117–107  | LeBron James (38)\n | LeBron James (16)\n | LeBron James (10)\n | The ArenaNo In-Person Attendance\n | 4–1\n |\n |\n| NBA Finals: 4–2 (home: 2–1; road: 2–1)\n\n| Game | Date | Team | Score | High points | High rebounds | High assists | LocationAttendance | Series\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | September 30\n | Miami | W 116–98  | Anthony Davis (34)\n | LeBron James (13)\n | LeBron James (9)\n | The ArenaNo In-Person Attendance\n | 1–0\n |\n| 2\n | October 2\n | Miami\n | W 124–114  | LeBron James (33)\n | Anthony Davis (14)\n | Rajon Rondo (10)\n | The ArenaNo In-Person Attendance\n | 2–0\n |\n| 3\n | October 4\n | @ Miami\n | L 104–115  | LeBron James (25)\n | LeBron James (10)\n | LeBron James (8)\n | The ArenaNo In-Person Attendance\n | 2–1\n |\n| 4\n | October 6\n | @ Miami\n | W 102–96  | LeBron James (28)\n | LeBron James (12)\n | LeBron James (8)\n | The ArenaNo In-Person Attendance\n | 3–1\n |\n| 5\n | October 9\n | Miami\n | L 108–111  | LeBron James (40)\n | LeBron James (13)\n | LeBron James (7)\n | The ArenaNo In-Person Attendance\n | 3–2\n |\n| 6\n | October 11\n | @ Miami\n | W 106–93  | LeBron James (28)\n | Anthony Davis (15)\n | LeBron James (10)\n | The ArenaNo In-Person Attendance\n | 4–2\n |\n |\n| 2020 playoff schedule |\n\n\n  \n† Originally scheduled for August 26.

In Western Conference semi-finals, they faced off against the fourth seed Houston Rockets, again winning in five games. They advanced to the Western Conference Finals for the first time since 2010, where they faced and defeated the Denver Nuggets in five games. They reached the NBA Finals for the first time in a decade, where they faced off the Eastern Conference champion Miami Heat, marking the first meeting between the two teams in the NBA Finals. The Lakers won the series in 6 games, winning the championship for the first time since the 2010 season. They became the first team since the 2007–08 Boston Celtics to go directly from a non-playoff season to a championship. This championship win also saw the Lakers tie the Celtics with the highest number of NBA championship wins at 17.[29][30] The Lakers' LeBron James was named the NBA Finals Most Valuable Player (MVP) for the fourth time in his career. He became the first player in league history to be named Finals MVP with three different franchises (two with the Heat, one with the Cleveland Cavaliers, and one with the Lakers) and he and Danny Green became the third and fourth players to win the NBA Finals with three different teams.[31] Lakers president Jeanie Buss became the first female controlling owner to guide her team to an NBA title.[32][33]\n\n\n\n## Roster[edit]\n\n\n\n\n2019–20 Los Angeles Lakers roster\n| Players\n | Coaches\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| \n\n| Pos. | No. | Name\n | Height\n | Weight\n | DOB\n | From\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| F | 37 | Antetokounmpo, Kostas (TW)\n | 6 ft 10 in (2.08 m)\n | 200 lb (91 kg)\n | 1997–11–20\n | Dayton |\n| G | 11 | Bradley, Avery | 6 ft 3 in (1.91 m)\n | 180 lb (82 kg)\n | 1990–11–26\n | Texas |\n| F | 12 | Cacok, Devontae (TW)\n | 6 ft 8 in (2.03 m)\n | 240 lb (109 kg)\n | 1996–10–08\n | UNC Wilmington |\n| G | 1 | Caldwell-Pope, Kentavious | 6 ft 5 in (1.96 m)\n | 204 lb (93 kg)\n | 1993–02–18\n | Georgia |\n| G | 4 | Caruso, Alex | 6 ft 5 in (1.96 m)\n | 186 lb (84 kg)\n | 1994–02–28\n | Texas A&M |\n| G | 28 | Cook, Quinn | 6 ft 1 in (1.85 m)\n | 180 lb (82 kg)\n | 1993–03–23\n | Duke |\n| F/C | 3 | Davis, Anthony (C)\n | 6 ft 10 in (2.08 m)\n | 253 lb (115 kg)\n | 1993–03–11\n | Kentucky |\n| F | 10 | Dudley, Jared | 6 ft 7 in (2.01 m)\n | 237 lb (108 kg)\n | 1985–07–10\n | Boston College |\n| G/F | 14 | Green, Danny | 6 ft 6 in (1.98 m)\n | 215 lb (98 kg)\n | 1987–06–22\n | North Carolina |\n| G | 5 | Horton-Tucker, Talen | 6 ft 4 in (1.93 m)\n | 234 lb (106 kg)\n | 2000–11–25\n | Iowa State |\n| C | 39 | Howard, Dwight | 6 ft 11 in (2.11 m)\n | 265 lb (120 kg)\n | 1985–12–08\n | SW Atlanta Academy (GA) |\n| F | 23 | James, LeBron (C)\n | 6 ft 9 in (2.06 m)\n | 250 lb (113 kg)\n | 1984–12–30\n | St. Vincent–St. Mary HS (OH) |\n| F | 0 | Kuzma, Kyle | 6 ft 9 in (2.06 m)\n | 221 lb (100 kg)\n | 1995–07–24\n | Utah |\n| C | 7 | McGee, JaVale | 7 ft 0 in (2.13 m)\n | 270 lb (122 kg)\n | 1988–01–19\n | Nevada |\n| F | 88 | Morris, Markieff | 6 ft 10 in (2.08 m)\n | 245 lb (111 kg)\n | 1989–09–02\n | Kansas |\n| G | 9 | Rondo, Rajon (C)\n | 6 ft 1 in (1.85 m)\n | 180 lb (82 kg)\n | 1986–02–22\n | Kentucky |\n| G | 21 | Smith, J.

The Lakers were coached by Frank Vogel in his first year as team head coach. The Lakers played their home games at Staples Center as members of the Western Conference's Pacific Division. The Lakers had the third best team defensive rating in the NBA.[1]\n\n\nOn March 6, 2020, the Lakers clinched their first playoff berth since the 2012–13 season. Five days later, due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the season was suspended.[2] On July 5, the NBA announced a return of the season in the NBA Bubble, with 22 teams playing 8 seeding games followed by a full postseason.[3] Play resumed on July 30 with all games being played in Orlando, Florida,[4] and on August 3, the Lakers clinched both their first Pacific Division title since 2012 and the top seed in the Western Conference playoffs for the first time since the 2009–10 season.\n\n\nThe Lakers finished the season 52–19, with a winning percentage equal to 60 games in a full 82-game season. They defeated the Portland Trail Blazers, Houston Rockets, and Denver Nuggets each in five games to advance to the NBA Finals for the first time since 2010. There they defeated the Miami Heat (LeBron James' former team) in six games to earn the franchise's 17th NBA championship, tying them with the Boston Celtics for the most of any NBA franchise. The team dedicated the season and the Finals win to Kobe Bryant, who was killed in a helicopter crash on January 26, 2020.\n\n\n\n\n## Previous season[edit]\n\n\nThe Lakers finished the 2018–19 season 37–45 to finish in fourth place in the Pacific Division and failing to qualify for the playoffs for the sixth consecutive year. Following the season, Magic Johnson stepped down as president of basketball operations. On April 12, 2019, head coach Luke Walton and the team agreed to part ways. On May 11, the Lakers hired Frank Vogel as head coach. The season marked the first time since 2005 that LeBron James did not appear in the playoffs and first time since 2010 that he missed the Finals.\n\n\n\n## Offseason[edit]\n\n\n### Front office and coaching changes[edit]\n\n\nOn April 9, 2019, Magic Johnson stepped down as president of basketball operations.[5] Three days after that, Luke Walton and the team agreed to part ways.[6] On May 13, the team hired Frank Vogel as their new head coach[7] and Jason Kidd was named an assistant coach.[8]\n\n\n\n### Draft[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2019 NBA draft\n\n\n\n| Round\n | Pick\n | Player\n | Position\n | Nationality\n | School / Club team\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | 4\n | De'Andre Hunter | SF\n | American\n | Virginia |\n\n\nThe Lakers held one first round draft pick for the 2019 NBA Draft.[9][10] They previously held the rights to two second rounders in this year's draft as well, but those selections were later traded to the Philadelphia 76ers and Atlanta Hawks as picks 34 and 41, respectively.[11][12] On the night of the NBA draft lottery, the Lakers rose up seven spots from the projected 11th selection to the 4th pick of the draft.[13] On June 15, the Lakers agreed to a trade that would send players Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball, and Josh Hart, and multiple draft picks, including the Lakers' 2019 1st round draft pick, to the New Orleans Pelicans in exchange for Anthony Davis. However, the trade was not finalized until July 6, during which time, the Washington Wizards were included in the deal as well.[14]\n\n\n\n### Trades[edit]\n\n\nOn June 15, 2019, the Lakers agreed to a trade with the New Orleans Pelicans to acquire six-time NBA All-Star power forward Anthony Davis, though the deal would not take full effect until July 6.[14] In exchange for Davis, the Lakers agreed to give up forward Brandon Ingram, guards Lonzo Ball and Josh Hart, three first-round picks (including their No. 4 overall selection in 2019), and a first-round pick swap in 2023.\n\n\nOn June 27, the Washington Wizards joined the trade to get Moritz Wagner, Isaac Bonga, Jemerrio Jones, and the Lakers' 2022 second-round pick in exchange for cash considerations.[15]\n\n\n\n### Free agents[edit]\n\n\nDuring the offseason, the Lakers were able to re-sign G Rajon Rondo, G Alex Caruso, G/F Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and C JaVale McGee.

James would take Davis with the No. 1 pick in the All-Star draft. Additionally, Vogel was also selected to coach Team LeBron in the All-Star Game. Team LeBron would go on to win 157–155, with Davis hitting a game-winning free throw.\n\n\nBy adding Davis, the Lakers got off to a fast start to the season, which included a 17–2 record by the end of November. Four months later, they were able to clinch their first playoff berth since the 2012–13 season with a win over the Milwaukee Bucks on March 6.\n\n\nHowever, five days after clinching their playoff berth, the NBA season was abruptly suspended by league officials [19] after it was reported that Rudy Gobert of the Utah Jazz tested positive for COVID-19.[20] Two unidentified players of the Lakers would later test positive for COVID-19 on March 19.[21] The season resumed, but Avery Bradley opted out of playing in the restart to remain with his family due to his oldest child, who had a history of struggling to recover from respiratory illnesses.[22] The Lakers replaced him on the roster with J. R. Smith, reuniting him with LeBron whom he won a championship with in 2016 with the Cleveland Cavaliers.[23]\n\n\n\n### Death of Kobe Bryant[edit]\n\n\nOn January 26, 2020, tragedy struck the Lakers organization when former All-Star guard Kobe Bryant died in a helicopter crash that also claimed the lives of his daughter Gianna \"Gigi\" Bryant and seven other passengers. Bryant was 41 at the time of his death, and Gigi was 13. This prompted the Lakers to dedicate the rest of their season to his memory.[24][25][26][27]\n\n\n\n## Playoffs[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: 2020 NBA playoffs\n\n### Game log[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2020 playoff game logTotal: 16–5 (Home: 9–3; Road: 7–2)\n |\n| --- |\n| First Round: 4–1 (home: 2–1; road: 2–0)\n\n| Game | Date | Team | Score | High points | High rebounds | High assists | LocationAttendance | Series\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | August 18\n | Portland | L 93–100  | Anthony Davis (28)\n | LeBron James (17)\n | LeBron James (16)\n | The ArenaNo In-Person Attendance\n | 0–1\n |\n| 2\n | August 20\n | Portland\n | W 111–88  | Anthony Davis (31)\n | Anthony Davis (11)\n | LeBron James (7)\n | The ArenaNo In-Person Attendance\n | 1–1\n |\n| 3\n | August 22\n | @ Portland\n | W 116–108  | LeBron James (38)\n | LeBron James (12)\n | Davis, James (8)\n | AdventHealth ArenaNo In-Person Attendance\n | 2–1\n |\n| 4\n | August 24\n | @ Portland\n | W 135–115  | LeBron James (30)\n | Howard, McGee (8)\n | LeBron James (10)\n | The ArenaNo In-Person Attendance\n | 3–1\n |\n| 5\n | August 29†\n | Portland\n | W 131–122  | Anthony Davis (43)\n | LeBron James (10)\n | LeBron James (10)\n | The ArenaNo In-Person Attendance\n | 4–1\n |\n |\n| Conference Semifinals: 4–1 (home: 2–1; road: 2–0)\n\n| Game | Date | Team | Score | High points | High rebounds | High assists | LocationAttendance | Series\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | September 4\n | Houston | L 97–112  | Anthony Davis (25)\n | Anthony Davis (14)\n | LeBron James (7)\n | The ArenaNo In-Person Attendance\n | 0–1\n |\n| 2\n | September 6\n | Houston\n | W 117–109  | Anthony Davis (34)\n | LeBron James (11)\n | James, Rondo (9)\n | The ArenaNo In-Person Attendance\n | 1–1\n |\n| 3\n | September 8\n | @ Houston\n | W 112–102  | LeBron James (36)\n | Anthony Davis (15)\n | Rajon Rondo (9)\n | The ArenaNo In-Person Attendance\n | 2–1\n |\n| 4\n | September 10\n | @ Houston\n | W 110–100  | Anthony Davis (29)\n | LeBron James (15)\n | LeBron James (9)\n | The ArenaNo In-Person Attendance\n | 3–1\n |\n| 5\n | September 12\n | Houston\n | W 119–96  | LeBron James (29)\n | Davis, James (11)\n | LeBron James (7)\n | The ArenaNo In-Person Attendance\n | 4–1\n |\n |\n| Conference Finals: 4–1 (home: 3–0; road: 1–1)\n\n| Game | Date | Team | Score | High points | High rebounds | High assists | LocationAttendance | Series\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | September 18\n | Denver | W 126–114  | Anthony Davis (37)\n | Anthony Davis (10)\n | LeBron James (12)\n | The ArenaNo In-Person Attendance\n | 1–0\n |\n| 2\n | September 20\n | Denver\n | W 105–103  | Anthony Davis (31)\n | LeBron James (11)\n | Rajon Rondo (9)\n | The ArenaNo In-Person Attendance\n | 2–0\n |\n| 3\n | September 22\n | @ Denver\n | L 106–114  | LeBron James (30)\n | LeBron James (10)\n | LeBron James (11)\n | The ArenaNo In-Person Attendance\n | 2–1\n |\n| 4\n | September 24\n | @ Denver\n | W 114–108  | Anthony Davis (34)\n | Dwight Howard (11)\n | LeBron James (8)\n | The ArenaNo In-Person Attendance\n | 3–1\n |\n| 5\n | September 26\n | Denver\n | W 117–107  | LeBron James (38)\n | LeBron James (16)\n | LeBron James (10)\n | The ArenaNo In-Person Attendance\n | 4–1\n |\n |\n| NBA Finals: 4–2 (home: 2–1; road: 2–1)\n\n| Game | Date | Team | Score | High points | High rebounds | High assists | LocationAttendance | Series\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | September 30\n | Miami | W 116–98  | Anthony Davis (34)\n | LeBron James (13)\n | LeBron James (9)\n | The ArenaNo In-Person Attendance\n | 1–0\n |\n| 2\n | October 2\n | Miami\n | W 124–114  | LeBron James (33)\n | Anthony Davis (14)\n | Rajon Rondo (10)\n | The ArenaNo In-Person Attendance\n | 2–0\n |\n| 3\n | October 4\n | @ Miami\n | L 104–115  | LeBron James (25)\n | LeBron James (10)\n | LeBron James (8)\n | The ArenaNo In-Person Attendance\n | 2–1\n |\n| 4\n | October 6\n | @ Miami\n | W 102–96  | LeBron James (28)\n | LeBron James (12)\n | LeBron James (8)\n | The ArenaNo In-Person Attendance\n | 3–1\n |\n| 5\n | October 9\n | Miami\n | L 108–111  | LeBron James (40)\n | LeBron James (13)\n | LeBron James (7)\n | The ArenaNo In-Person Attendance\n | 3–2\n |\n| 6\n | October 11\n | @ Miami\n | W 106–93  | LeBron James (28)\n | Anthony Davis (15)\n | LeBron James (10)\n | The ArenaNo In-Person Attendance\n | 4–2\n |\n |\n| 2020 playoff schedule |\n\n\n  \n† Originally scheduled for August 26.

In Western Conference semi-finals, they faced off against the fourth seed Houston Rockets, again winning in five games. They advanced to the Western Conference Finals for the first time since 2010, where they faced and defeated the Denver Nuggets in five games. They reached the NBA Finals for the first time in a decade, where they faced off the Eastern Conference champion Miami Heat, marking the first meeting between the two teams in the NBA Finals. The Lakers won the series in 6 games, winning the championship for the first time since the 2010 season. They became the first team since the 2007–08 Boston Celtics to go directly from a non-playoff season to a championship. This championship win also saw the Lakers tie the Celtics with the highest number of NBA championship wins at 17.[29][30] The Lakers' LeBron James was named the NBA Finals Most Valuable Player (MVP) for the fourth time in his career. He became the first player in league history to be named Finals MVP with three different franchises (two with the Heat, one with the Cleveland Cavaliers, and one with the Lakers) and he and Danny Green became the third and fourth players to win the NBA Finals with three different teams.[31] Lakers president Jeanie Buss became the first female controlling owner to guide her team to an NBA title.[32][33]\n\n\n\n## Roster[edit]\n\n\n\n\n2019–20 Los Angeles Lakers roster\n| Players\n | Coaches\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| \n\n| Pos. | No. | Name\n | Height\n | Weight\n | DOB\n | From\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| F | 37 | Antetokounmpo, Kostas (TW)\n | 6 ft 10 in (2.08 m)\n | 200 lb (91 kg)\n | 1997–11–20\n | Dayton |\n| G | 11 | Bradley, Avery | 6 ft 3 in (1.91 m)\n | 180 lb (82 kg)\n | 1990–11–26\n | Texas |\n| F | 12 | Cacok, Devontae (TW)\n | 6 ft 8 in (2.03 m)\n | 240 lb (109 kg)\n | 1996–10–08\n | UNC Wilmington |\n| G | 1 | Caldwell-Pope, Kentavious | 6 ft 5 in (1.96 m)\n | 204 lb (93 kg)\n | 1993–02–18\n | Georgia |\n| G | 4 | Caruso, Alex | 6 ft 5 in (1.96 m)\n | 186 lb (84 kg)\n | 1994–02–28\n | Texas A&M |\n| G | 28 | Cook, Quinn | 6 ft 1 in (1.85 m)\n | 180 lb (82 kg)\n | 1993–03–23\n | Duke |\n| F/C | 3 | Davis, Anthony (C)\n | 6 ft 10 in (2.08 m)\n | 253 lb (115 kg)\n | 1993–03–11\n | Kentucky |\n| F | 10 | Dudley, Jared | 6 ft 7 in (2.01 m)\n | 237 lb (108 kg)\n | 1985–07–10\n | Boston College |\n| G/F | 14 | Green, Danny | 6 ft 6 in (1.98 m)\n | 215 lb (98 kg)\n | 1987–06–22\n | North Carolina |\n| G | 5 | Horton-Tucker, Talen | 6 ft 4 in (1.93 m)\n | 234 lb (106 kg)\n | 2000–11–25\n | Iowa State |\n| C | 39 | Howard, Dwight | 6 ft 11 in (2.11 m)\n | 265 lb (120 kg)\n | 1985–12–08\n | SW Atlanta Academy (GA) |\n| F | 23 | James, LeBron (C)\n | 6 ft 9 in (2.06 m)\n | 250 lb (113 kg)\n | 1984–12–30\n | St. Vincent–St. Mary HS (OH) |\n| F | 0 | Kuzma, Kyle | 6 ft 9 in (2.06 m)\n | 221 lb (100 kg)\n | 1995–07–24\n | Utah |\n| C | 7 | McGee, JaVale | 7 ft 0 in (2.13 m)\n | 270 lb (122 kg)\n | 1988–01–19\n | Nevada |\n| F | 88 | Morris, Markieff | 6 ft 10 in (2.08 m)\n | 245 lb (111 kg)\n | 1989–09–02\n | Kansas |\n| G | 9 | Rondo, Rajon (C)\n | 6 ft 1 in (1.85 m)\n | 180 lb (82 kg)\n | 1986–02–22\n | Kentucky |\n| G | 21 | Smith, J.

During the off-season, the Raptors acquired small forward Kawhi Leonard from the San Antonio Spurs after trading franchise star DeMar DeRozan. The season ended with the franchise's first NBA Finals appearance and first NBA championship, ending the City of Toronto's, 26-year championship drought if not counting Toronto FC’s 2017 MLS championship or Toronto Argonauts multiple Grey Cup Championships. The Raptors were one of two teams to have an offense and defensive rating that both ranked in the top 5 of the NBA.\n\n\nOn May 11, 2018, the Raptors fired Dwane Casey after the team was swept by the Cleveland Cavaliers\nfor the second consecutive time in the postseason.[1] On June 14, the Raptors promoted assistant coach Nick Nurse as their head coach.[2] The Raptors played their home games at newly renamed Scotiabank Arena.[3] For the first time since 2008–09, DeMar DeRozan (who spent his first nine seasons in the NBA with the Raptors) did not play for the Raptors, as he was traded, along with Jakob Poeltl and a protected 2019 first-round draft pick, to the San Antonio Spurs for Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green. Later, on February 7, 2019, at the trade deadline, the Memphis Grizzlies traded Marc Gasol to the Raptors for Jonas Valančiūnas, Delon Wright and C. J. Miles. The Raptors later signed Jeremy Lin.\n\n\nThe Raptors finished the regular season with a 58–24 record, one less win than their franchise best the previous season, second best in the league for the second consecutive season, earning the second seed in the Eastern Conference. They also won their fifth Atlantic Division title in six years.\n\n\nIn the playoffs, the Raptors defeated the Orlando Magic in five games in the first round. They edged the Philadelphia 76ers in seven games in the semifinals to make their first Eastern Conference Finals appearance since 2016, with Kawhi Leonard's buzzer-beater over Joel Embiid, giving the Raptors a 92–90 victory in the series-clinching game 7. The series was a rematch of the 2001 Eastern Conference Semifinals, where the Allen Iverson-led 76ers defeated the Vince Carter-led Raptors in seven games. The Raptors defeated the Milwaukee Bucks in the Eastern Conference Finals 4–2, winning the last four games of the series after being down 0–2 to become the sixth team to overcome that deficit. They won the Finals against the two-time defending NBA champion Golden State Warriors, also the first NBA Finals series that was played outside the United States. They beat the Warriors 4–2, becoming the first non-US team to win the NBA title.[4] The Raptors were the first Atlantic Division team since the 2007–08 Boston Celtics and the first Eastern Conference team since the 2015–16 Cleveland Cavaliers to win the championship. Prior to the Raptors victory, the Atlantic Division had had the second longest title drought in the league. Until the Denver Nuggets claimed their first championship in 2023, the Northwest Division held the record for having the longest championship drought of all divisions in the league, with the 1978–79 Seattle Supersonics being the last champion. This is also Toronto's first major sports championship since the Toronto Blue Jays won the 1993 World Series when not counting Toronto FC’s 2017 MLS championship or Toronto Argonauts multiple Grey Cup Championships.\n\n\n\n\n## Draft[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2018 NBA draft\n\nThe Raptors did not have a pick in the 2018 NBA draft. They had previously traded their selections to the Brooklyn Nets, who ended up drafting Džanan Musa, and to the Phoenix Suns, who ended up drafting George King.\n\n\n\n## Roster[edit]\n\n\n\n\n2018–19 Toronto Raptors roster\n| Players\n | Coaches\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| \n\n| Pos. | No. | Name\n | Height\n | Weight\n | DOB\n | From\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| F | 3 | Anunoby, OG | 6 ft 8 in (2.03 m)\n | 232 lb (105 kg)\n | 1997–07–17\n | Indiana |\n| F | 25 | Boucher, Chris | 6 ft 10 in (2.08 m)\n | 200 lb (91 kg)\n | 1993–01–11\n | Oregon |\n| C | 33 | Gasol, Marc | 7 ft 1 in (2.16 m)\n | 255 lb (116 kg)\n | 1985–01–29\n | Spain |\n| G/F | 14 | Green, Danny | 6 ft 6 in (1.98 m)\n | 215 lb (98 kg)\n | 1987–06–22\n | North Carolina |\n| F/C | 9 | Ibaka, Serge | 7 ft 0 in (2.13 m)\n | 235 lb (107 kg)\n | 1989–09–18\n | Republic of the Congo |\n| F | 2 | Leonard, Kawhi | 6 ft 7 in (2.01 m)\n | 230 lb (104 kg)\n | 1991–06–29\n | San Diego State |\n| G | 17 | Lin, Jeremy | 6 ft 3 in (1.91 m)\n | 200 lb (91 kg)\n | 1988–08–23\n | Harvard |\n| G | 7 | Lowry, Kyle (C)\n | 6 ft 0 in (1.83 m)\n | 196 lb (89 kg)\n | 1986–03–25\n | Villanova |\n| G | 8 | Loyd, Jordan (TW)\n | 6 ft 4 in (1.93 m)\n | 210 lb (95 kg)\n | 1993–07–27\n | Indianapolis |\n| G | 1 | McCaw, Patrick | 6 ft 7 in (2.01 m)\n | 185 lb (84 kg)\n | 1995–10–25\n | UNLV |\n| G | 20 | Meeks, Jodie | 6 ft 4 in (1.93 m)\n | 210 lb (95 kg)\n | 1987–08–21\n | Kentucky |\n| F | 13 | Miller, Malcolm | 6 ft 7 in (2.01 m)\n | 210 lb (95 kg)\n | 1993–03–06\n | Holy Cross |\n| F/C | 15 | Moreland, Eric | 6 ft 10 in (2.08 m)\n | 238 lb (108 kg)\n | 1991–12–24\n | Oregon State |\n| G | 24 | Powell, Norman | 6 ft 4 in (1.93 m)\n | 215 lb (98 kg)\n | 1993–05–25\n | UCLA |\n| F | 43 | Siakam, Pascal | 6 ft 9 in (2.06 m)\n | 230 lb (104 kg)\n | 1994–04–02\n | New Mexico State |\n| G | 23 | VanVleet, Fred | 6 ft 0 in (1.83 m)\n | 195 lb (88 kg)\n | 1994–02–25\n | Wichita State |\n\n | Head coach* Nick Nurse\n\nAssistant coach(es)* Nate Bjorkgren\n* Adrian Griffin\n* Phil Handy\n* Eric Khoury\n* Alex McKechnie\n* Patrick Mutombo\n* Jim Sann\n* Sergio Scariolo\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nLegend\n* **(DP)** Unsigned draft pick\n* **(FA)** Free agent\n* **(S)** Suspended\n* **(GL)** On assignment to G League affiliate\n* **(TW)** Two-way affiliate player\n* ![Injured](image) Injured\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nRoster  Last transaction: 2019–06–12\n |\n\n\n## Standings[edit]\n\n\n### Division[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Atlantic Division | W | L | PCT | GB | Home | Road | Div | GP |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **y** – Toronto Raptors | 58 | 24 | .707 | – | 32‍–‍9 | 26‍–‍15 | 12–4 | 82 |\n| **x** – Philadelphia 76ers | 51 | 31 | .622 | 7.0 | 31‍–‍10 | 20‍–‍21 | 8–8 | 82 |\n| **x** – Boston Celtics | 49 | 33 | .598 | 9.0 | 28‍–‍13 | 21‍–‍20 | 10–6 | 82 |\n| **x** – Brooklyn Nets | 42 | 40 | .512 | 16.0 | 23‍–‍18 | 19‍–‍22 | 8–8 | 82 |\n| New York Knicks | 17 | 65 | .207 | 41.0 | 9‍–‍32 | 8‍–‍33 | 2–14 | 82 |\n\n\n### Conference[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Eastern Conference |\n| --- |\n| #

During the off-season, the Raptors acquired small forward Kawhi Leonard from the San Antonio Spurs after trading franchise star DeMar DeRozan. The season ended with the franchise's first NBA Finals appearance and first NBA championship, ending the City of Toronto's, 26-year championship drought if not counting Toronto FC’s 2017 MLS championship or Toronto Argonauts multiple Grey Cup Championships. The Raptors were one of two teams to have an offense and defensive rating that both ranked in the top 5 of the NBA.\n\n\nOn May 11, 2018, the Raptors fired Dwane Casey after the team was swept by the Cleveland Cavaliers\nfor the second consecutive time in the postseason.[1] On June 14, the Raptors promoted assistant coach Nick Nurse as their head coach.[2] The Raptors played their home games at newly renamed Scotiabank Arena.[3] For the first time since 2008–09, DeMar DeRozan (who spent his first nine seasons in the NBA with the Raptors) did not play for the Raptors, as he was traded, along with Jakob Poeltl and a protected 2019 first-round draft pick, to the San Antonio Spurs for Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green. Later, on February 7, 2019, at the trade deadline, the Memphis Grizzlies traded Marc Gasol to the Raptors for Jonas Valančiūnas, Delon Wright and C. J. Miles. The Raptors later signed Jeremy Lin.\n\n\nThe Raptors finished the regular season with a 58–24 record, one less win than their franchise best the previous season, second best in the league for the second consecutive season, earning the second seed in the Eastern Conference. They also won their fifth Atlantic Division title in six years.\n\n\nIn the playoffs, the Raptors defeated the Orlando Magic in five games in the first round. They edged the Philadelphia 76ers in seven games in the semifinals to make their first Eastern Conference Finals appearance since 2016, with Kawhi Leonard's buzzer-beater over Joel Embiid, giving the Raptors a 92–90 victory in the series-clinching game 7. The series was a rematch of the 2001 Eastern Conference Semifinals, where the Allen Iverson-led 76ers defeated the Vince Carter-led Raptors in seven games. The Raptors defeated the Milwaukee Bucks in the Eastern Conference Finals 4–2, winning the last four games of the series after being down 0–2 to become the sixth team to overcome that deficit. They won the Finals against the two-time defending NBA champion Golden State Warriors, also the first NBA Finals series that was played outside the United States. They beat the Warriors 4–2, becoming the first non-US team to win the NBA title.[4] The Raptors were the first Atlantic Division team since the 2007–08 Boston Celtics and the first Eastern Conference team since the 2015–16 Cleveland Cavaliers to win the championship. Prior to the Raptors victory, the Atlantic Division had had the second longest title drought in the league. Until the Denver Nuggets claimed their first championship in 2023, the Northwest Division held the record for having the longest championship drought of all divisions in the league, with the 1978–79 Seattle Supersonics being the last champion. This is also Toronto's first major sports championship since the Toronto Blue Jays won the 1993 World Series when not counting Toronto FC’s 2017 MLS championship or Toronto Argonauts multiple Grey Cup Championships.\n\n\n\n\n## Draft[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2018 NBA draft\n\nThe Raptors did not have a pick in the 2018 NBA draft. They had previously traded their selections to the Brooklyn Nets, who ended up drafting Džanan Musa, and to the Phoenix Suns, who ended up drafting George King.\n\n\n\n## Roster[edit]\n\n\n\n\n2018–19 Toronto Raptors roster\n| Players\n | Coaches\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| \n\n| Pos. | No. | Name\n | Height\n | Weight\n | DOB\n | From\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| F | 3 | Anunoby, OG | 6 ft 8 in (2.03 m)\n | 232 lb (105 kg)\n | 1997–07–17\n | Indiana |\n| F | 25 | Boucher, Chris | 6 ft 10 in (2.08 m)\n | 200 lb (91 kg)\n | 1993–01–11\n | Oregon |\n| C | 33 | Gasol, Marc | 7 ft 1 in (2.16 m)\n | 255 lb (116 kg)\n | 1985–01–29\n | Spain |\n| G/F | 14 | Green, Danny | 6 ft 6 in (1.98 m)\n | 215 lb (98 kg)\n | 1987–06–22\n | North Carolina |\n| F/C | 9 | Ibaka, Serge | 7 ft 0 in (2.13 m)\n | 235 lb (107 kg)\n | 1989–09–18\n | Republic of the Congo |\n| F | 2 | Leonard, Kawhi | 6 ft 7 in (2.01 m)\n | 230 lb (104 kg)\n | 1991–06–29\n | San Diego State |\n| G | 17 | Lin, Jeremy | 6 ft 3 in (1.91 m)\n | 200 lb (91 kg)\n | 1988–08–23\n | Harvard |\n| G | 7 | Lowry, Kyle (C)\n | 6 ft 0 in (1.83 m)\n | 196 lb (89 kg)\n | 1986–03–25\n | Villanova |\n| G | 8 | Loyd, Jordan (TW)\n | 6 ft 4 in (1.93 m)\n | 210 lb (95 kg)\n | 1993–07–27\n | Indianapolis |\n| G | 1 | McCaw, Patrick | 6 ft 7 in (2.01 m)\n | 185 lb (84 kg)\n | 1995–10–25\n | UNLV |\n| G | 20 | Meeks, Jodie | 6 ft 4 in (1.93 m)\n | 210 lb (95 kg)\n | 1987–08–21\n | Kentucky |\n| F | 13 | Miller, Malcolm | 6 ft 7 in (2.01 m)\n | 210 lb (95 kg)\n | 1993–03–06\n | Holy Cross |\n| F/C | 15 | Moreland, Eric | 6 ft 10 in (2.08 m)\n | 238 lb (108 kg)\n | 1991–12–24\n | Oregon State |\n| G | 24 | Powell, Norman | 6 ft 4 in (1.93 m)\n | 215 lb (98 kg)\n | 1993–05–25\n | UCLA |\n| F | 43 | Siakam, Pascal | 6 ft 9 in (2.06 m)\n | 230 lb (104 kg)\n | 1994–04–02\n | New Mexico State |\n| G | 23 | VanVleet, Fred | 6 ft 0 in (1.83 m)\n | 195 lb (88 kg)\n | 1994–02–25\n | Wichita State |\n\n | Head coach* Nick Nurse\n\nAssistant coach(es)* Nate Bjorkgren\n* Adrian Griffin\n* Phil Handy\n* Eric Khoury\n* Alex McKechnie\n* Patrick Mutombo\n* Jim Sann\n* Sergio Scariolo\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nLegend\n* **(DP)** Unsigned draft pick\n* **(FA)** Free agent\n* **(S)** Suspended\n* **(GL)** On assignment to G League affiliate\n* **(TW)** Two-way affiliate player\n* ![Injured](image) Injured\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nRoster  Last transaction: 2019–06–12\n |\n\n\n## Standings[edit]\n\n\n### Division[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Atlantic Division | W | L | PCT | GB | Home | Road | Div | GP |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **y** – Toronto Raptors | 58 | 24 | .707 | – | 32‍–‍9 | 26‍–‍15 | 12–4 | 82 |\n| **x** – Philadelphia 76ers | 51 | 31 | .622 | 7.0 | 31‍–‍10 | 20‍–‍21 | 8–8 | 82 |\n| **x** – Boston Celtics | 49 | 33 | .598 | 9.0 | 28‍–‍13 | 21‍–‍20 | 10–6 | 82 |\n| **x** – Brooklyn Nets | 42 | 40 | .512 | 16.0 | 23‍–‍18 | 19‍–‍22 | 8–8 | 82 |\n| New York Knicks | 17 | 65 | .207 | 41.0 | 9‍–‍32 | 8‍–‍33 | 2–14 | 82 |\n\n\n### Conference[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Eastern Conference |\n| --- |\n| #
