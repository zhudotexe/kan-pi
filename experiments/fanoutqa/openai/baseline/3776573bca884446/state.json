A vast majority of the state consists of suburbs of these two cities, an explanation for much of the state\u2019s high incomes. Approximately 76% of New Jersey places have per capita incomes above the national average[*citation needed*]; however, according to the 2008-2012 American Community Survey, 9.9% (US average 14.9%) of the population lives below the poverty line.[1] Three of the country's wealthiest counties are located in the north and central portion of the state, including Morris County (4th nationally), Somerset County (8th), and Hunterdon County (10th).[7] There are also several seaside resorts along the New Jersey shoreline that are particularly wealthy, such as Mantoloking, Sea Girt, and Spring Lake along the coast close to New York and Sea Isle City, Avalon, and Stone Harbor in the south[*citation needed*]. Southern New Jersey, is less affluent overall, excluding several Philadelphia suburbs in Camden, Burlington and Gloucester Counties and the coast. Camden, the poorest city in the state, has a poverty rate of 35.5%. Other poor areas are the cities across the Hudson River from New York City, including Newark, Paterson, and Passaic.\n\n\nIn 2012, 9.1% of New Jersey households have annual incomes of or over $200,000, and 17.5% have incomes of $100,000 or more. By contrast, 5.3% have incomes of less than $10,000, and 24.9% less than $34,999.[1]\n\n\n\n## New Jersey counties ranked by per capita income[edit]\n\n\nSee also: United States counties by per capita income\n\nNote: Data is from the 2010 United States Census Data and the 2006-2010 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates.[8][9]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Rank\n | County\n | Per capitaincome\n | Medianhouseholdincome\n | Medianfamilyincome\n | Population\n | Number ofhouseholds\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | Hunterdon | $48,489\n | $100,980\n | $121,166\n | 128,349\n | 47,169\n |\n| 2\n | Morris | $47,342\n | $96,747\n | $114,694\n | 492,276\n | 180,534\n |\n| 3\n | Somerset | $47,067\n | $97,440\n | $115,214\n | 323,444\n | 117,759\n |\n| 4\n | Bergen | $42,006\n | $81,708\n | $100,310\n | 905,116\n | 335,730\n |\n| 5\n | Monmouth | $40,976\n | $82,265\n | $102,074\n | 630,380\n | 233,983\n |\n| 6\n | Mercer | $36,016\n | $71,217\n | $88,694\n | 366,513\n | 133,155\n |\n| 7\n | Sussex | $35,982\n | $83,089\n | $93,701\n | 149,265\n | 54,752\n |\n|  | *New Jersey* | $34,858\n | $69,811\n | $84,904\n | 8,791,894\n | 3,214,360\n |\n| 8\n | Burlington | $34,802\n | $76,258\n | $91,185\n | 448,734\n | 166,318\n |\n| 9\n | Union | $34,096\n | $66,791\n | $80,818\n | 536,499\n | 188,118\n |\n| 10\n | Cape May | $33,571\n | $54,292\n | $69,978\n | 97,265\n | 40,812\n |\n| 11\n | Middlesex | $33,289\n | $77,615\n | $91,543\n | 809,858\n | 281,186\n |\n| 12\n | Warren | $32,985\n | $71,364\n | $85,635\n | 108,692\n | 41,480\n |\n| 13\n | Essex | $31,535\n | $55,125\n | $68,683\n | 783,969\n | 283,712\n |\n| 14\n | Gloucester | $31,210\n | $72,664\n | $85,832\n | 288,288\n | 104,271\n |\n| 15\n | Hudson | $31,024\n | $55,275\n | $58,968\n | 634,266\n | 246,437\n |\n| 16\n | Ocean | $29,826\n | $59,620\n | $73,672\n | 576,567\n | 221,111\n |\n| 17\n | Camden | $29,478\n | $60,976\n | $74,385\n | 513,657\n | 190,980\n |\n|  | *United States* | $27,334\n | $51,914\n | $62,982\n | 308,745,538\n | 116,716,292\n |\n| 18\n | Salem | $27,296\n | $59,441\n | $72,537\n | 66,083\n | 25,290\n |\n| 19\n | Atlantic | $27,247\n | $54,766\n | $66,920\n | 274,549\n | 102,847\n |\n| 20\n | Passaic | $26,095\n | $54,944\n | $67,208\n | 501,226\n | 166,785\n |\n| 21\n | Cumberland | $21,883\n | $50,651\n | $60,642\n | 156,898\n | 51,931\n |\n\n\n## New Jersey places ranked by per capita income[edit]\n\n\nThis is a list of all incorporated areas and census-designated places in New Jersey ranked by per capita income based on data from the 2020 United States Census and 2021 American Community Survey.\n\n\nThere are many communities not on the list because they are not incorporated, not a census-designated place, or too small for explicit recording.

The program was formally inaugurated with a series of listings on October 9, 1960; as of August 21, 2020, there are 2,597 designated landmarks. A National Historic Landmark (NHL) is generally a building, district, object, site, or structure, that is officially recognized by the United States government for its national historical significance. A National Historic Landmark District (NHLD) is a historic district that is recognized as an NHL. Its geographic area may include contributing properties that are buildings, structures, sites or objects, and it may include non-contributing properties.\n\n\nThe program is administered by the National Park Service (NPS), a branch of the Department of the Interior. The National Park Service determines which properties meet NHL criteria and makes nomination recommendations after an owner notification process.[1] The secretary of the interior reviews nominations and, based on a set of predetermined criteria, makes a decision on NHL designation or a determination of eligibility for designation.[2] Both public and privately owned properties can be designated as NHLs. This designation provides indirect, partial protection of the historic integrity of the properties via tax incentives, grants, monitoring of threats, and other means.[1] Owners may object to the nomination of the property as an NHL. When this is the case the secretary of the interior can only designate a site as eligible for designation.[2]\n\n\nAll NHLs are also included on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), a list of some 80,000 historic properties that the National Park Service deems to be worthy of recognition. The primary difference between an NHL and a NRHP listing is that the NHLs are determined to have national significance, while other NRHP properties are deemed significant at the local or state level.[1]\n\n\n\n\n## Tabular listing[edit]\n\n\nMost landmark designations are in one of the 50 states. New York is the state with the most (270), and New York City, with 114 designations, is the city with the largest number of designations. Of the states, North Dakota has the fewest designations with seven. Three cities (New York City, Philadelphia, and Boston) have enough listings to warrant lists separate from their respective states.\n\n\nA small number of designations have been made outside the 50 states. Most of these appear in United States possessions. The Virgin Islands have five listings, Puerto Rico has four, and island possessions in the South Pacific have six. Five listings are found in Pacific island nations with which the U.S. has established a free association agreement, and one listing, the American Legation in Tangier (the nation's first foreign public property), is found in the unaffiliated Kingdom of Morocco.\n\n\n\n\n\n| State orregion\n | Number oflandmarks\n | Earliestdeclared[3] | Latestdeclared[3] | Example\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Alabama | 39 | October 9, 1960 | January 13, 2021 | ![Edmund Pettus Bridge](image) |\n| Alaska | 50 | January 20, 1961 | December 23, 2016 | ![St. Michael's Cathedral](image) |\n| Arizona | 47[4][5] | October 9, 1960 | December 23, 2016 | ![Hoover Dam](image) |\n| Arkansas | 17 | October 9, 1960 | July 31, 2003 | ![Little Rock Central High](image) |\n| California | 146[6][5] | October 9, 1960 | December 23, 2016 | ![Hearst Castle](image) |\n| Colorado | 26[7] | December 19, 1960 | January 13, 2021 | ![Pikes Peak](image) |\n| Connecticut | 64 | October 9, 1960 | October 31, 2016 | ![Mark Twain House](image) |\n| Delaware | 14 | January 20, 1961 | December 23, 2016 | ![New Castle](image) |\n| Florida | 47 | October 9, 1960 | January 13, 2021 | ![Hemingway House](image) |\n| Georgia | 49 | January 20, 1961 | July 21, 2015 | ![](image) |\n| Hawaii | 33 | December 29, 1962 | March 29, 2007 | ![USS Arizona](image) |\n| Idaho | 10[8] | October 9, 1960 | June 21, 1990 | ![Experimental Breeder Reactor I](image) |\n| Illinois | 88[9] | October 9, 1960 | September 23, 2020 | ![Cahokia](image) |\n| Indiana | 43 | October 9, 1960 | December 23, 2016 | ![](image) |\n| Iowa | 27[10] | June 30, 1960 | January 13, 2021 | ![Amana Colonies](image) |\n| Kansas | 26 | December 19, 1960 | December 23, 2016 | ![Grant Hall at Fort Leavenworth.](image) |\n| Kentucky | 32[11] | December 19, 1960 | February 27, 2013 | ![Roebling Suspension Bridge](image) |\n| Louisiana | 54 | October 9, 1960 | July 21, 2015 | ![French Quarter](image) |\n| Maine | 44 | October 9, 1960 | August 25, 2014 | ![Olson House](image) |\n| Maryland | 76[12] | October 9, 1960 | January 13, 2021 | ![St Marys City](image) |\n| Massachusetts(Boston alone)\n | 191(57)\n | October 9, 1960 | February 27, 2015 | ![Castle Hill](image) |\n| Michigan | 43 | October 9, 1960 | January 13, 2021 | ![Mackinac Island](image) |\n| Minnesota | 25 | December 19, 1960 | June 23, 2011 | ![](image) |\n| Mississippi | 40[13] | July 19, 1964 | February 16, 2017 | ![Beauvoir](image) |\n| Missouri | 37[9] | October 9, 1960 | March 29, 2007 | ![Gateway Arch](image) |\n| Montana | 28[8][14] | October 9, 1960 | July 21, 2015 | ![Going-to-the-Sun Road](image) |\n| Nebraska | 22 | December 19, 1960 | January 13, 2021 | ![Nebraska State Capitol](image) |\n| Nevada | 8[4] | January 20, 1961 | October 16, 2012 | ![Fort Churchill](image) |\n| New Hampshire | 23 | October 9, 1960 | February 27, 2013 | ![Mt.
