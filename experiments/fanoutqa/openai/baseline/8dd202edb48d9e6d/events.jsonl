Delhi's version of a humid subtropical climate is markedly different from many other humid subtropical cities such as São Paulo, Houston, and Brisbane in that the city features dust storms (something more commonly seen in a desert climate) and wildfire haze (something seen in a Mediterranean climate) due to its semi-arid climate.[1]\n\n\nSummer starts in early April and peaks in late May or early June, with average temperatures near 38 °C (100 °F) although occasional heat waves can result in highs close to 45 °C (113 °F) on some days and therefore higher apparent temperature. The monsoon starts in late June and lasts until mid-September, with about 797.3 mm (31.39 inches)[2] of rain. The average temperatures are around 29 °C (84 °F), although they can vary from around 25 °C (77 °F) on rainy days to 35–40 °C (95–104 °F) during dry spells. The monsoons recede in late September, and the post-monsoon season continues till late October, with average temperatures sliding from 29 to 21 °C (84 to 70 °F).\n\n\nWinter starts in November and peaks in January, with average temperatures around 14 °C (57 °F). Although daytime temperatures are warm, Delhi's proximity to the Himalayas results in cold waves leading to lower apparent temperature due to wind chill. Delhi is notorious for its heavy fogs and haze during the winter season. In December, reduced visibility leads to disruption of road, air and rail traffic.[3] Winter ends by the first week of March.\n\n\nExtreme temperatures have ranged from −2.2 to 48.4 °C (28.0 to 119.1 °F).[4]\n\n\n\n\n## Classifications[edit]\n\n\n\n\nDelhi Climate according to major climate systems\n| Climatic scheme\n | Initials\n | Description\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Köppen system[5] | *Cwa* | Monsoon-influenced humid subtropical\n |\n| Trewartha system[6] | *Aw* | Tropical wet-and-dry |\n| Alisov system[7] | —\n | Sub-equatorial climate\n |\n| Strahler system[8] | —\n | Dry tropical semi-arid\n |\n| Thornthwaite system[9] | DA'd\n | Semi-arid and megathermal |\n| Neef system[10] | —\n | Tropical alternating climate equatorial climate\n |\n\n\n## Overview of seasonal distribution[edit]\n\n\n* Spring: February, March; warm days, cool nights, pleasant; low to moderate humidity; moderate precipitation\n* Summer: April, May, June; hot to very hot; very low to moderate humidity; low precipitation\n* Monsoon (Rainy): July, August, September; hot, pleasant during rains; high to very high humidity; heavy precipitation\n* Autumn: October, November; warm days, cool nights, pleasant; low humidity; low precipitation\n* Winter: December, January; cool days, cold nights; moderate humidity; medium precipitation\n\n\n## Seasons[edit]\n\n\nDelhi lies in the landlocked Northern Plains of the Indian Subcontinent. Its climate is greatly influenced by its proximity to the Himalayas and the Thar Desert, causing it to experience both weather extremes. Delhi has 5 distinct seasons, viz. Summer, Rainy, Autumn, Winter and Spring.[11] Broadly speaking, Delhi has long and scorching summers- sub-divided into dry summer and humid monsoon seasons, short and mildly cold winters, and two bouts of pleasant transition seasons. Two most important wind patterns influencing Delhi's climate are the Western Disturbance and the South-West Winds.\n\n\nDelhi experienced its coolest May in 36 years with excess rainfall, bringing the average maximum temperature down to 36.8°C, the lowest since 1987, according to the India Meteorological Department. [12] [13]\n\n\n\n### Summer[edit]\n\n\nSummer begins in early April and continues till the middle of June, with the heat peaking in late May and early June. It is characterized by extreme heat, low humidity, very hot winds and thunderstorms. Delhi's proximity to the Thar Desert results in hot, dry continental winds, called loo, at times blowing all across from the West Asian mainland, making the days feel hotter. These winds, blowing over from vast land stretches, are very hot and dry. Since the Western Disturbance depression moves eastward (and is the reason for cyclonic occurrences in Eastern Coastal areas) by this time of the year, there is no moisture-laden wind to increase humidity. The air therefore remains dry or very dry during day. For most of its summer season, Delhi has a semi-arid climate.[1] Coming from Spring, the city witnesses a spurt in day temperature around early April, whereas nights still remain pleasant. By the latter part of April or during early May, maximum temperatures exceed 40 °C (104 °F) while the ambience remains very dry. Night temperatures cross the 20 °C (68 °F) mark towards the latter part of April. May is Delhi's hottest month during which temperatures may reach 45 °C (113 °F) or higher.[14] This month is characterized by frequent thunderstorms.[15] Dust storms are another feature of Delhi's summer,[16][17] and can be severe and destructive when accompanied by strong winds, particularly under cumulonimbus formation.[18] These are caused due to fine dust brought along by the hot winds arriving from the desert. They make the surroundings appear pale yellow, bring temperatures slightly down and are usually followed by thunderstorms. Post mid-June, temperatures start falling slowly, while humidity shows a gradual rise.\nA visual characteristic of summer in Delhi is the summer bloom, particularly the blooming Bougainvillea, Amaltas, Gulmohar, Shireesh and Jacaranda trees, which look spectacular when fully flowering during peak summer in May.[19]\n\n\n\n### Monsoon[edit]\n\n\nMonsoon winds arrive in Delhi by either the end of June or the first week of July.[11] The arrival of moisture laden South-Western winds, traveling from the Arabian Sea marks the onset of the humid season in Delhi. This season is marked by high levels of humidity and high heat. Day temperatures drop below 40 °C (104 °F) as humidity suddenly soars.[20] July is marked by high heat and relatively less precipitation (as compared to August). This transition from scorching to sweltering heat between June and July makes the latter feel very uncomfortable. August is Delhi's wettest month. The heat is considerably reduced and it is relatively cooler for most part of the month. There is dense cloud formation in the sky and at least a week of distinct, heavy rainfall.[21] By September, the amount and frequency of precipitation drops, though humidity remains high.[22] Towards the end of September, moisture content in the air begins to fall and monsoon ends by early October. In India, the Rainy season is referred to as \"Rituraani\", meaning the Queen of Seasons.\n\n\n\n### Autumn[edit]\n\n\nThe end of monsoon marks the arrival of a transition season. Autumn arrives by early or mid October, and is marked by very dry ambiance, warm days and pleasant nights. Maximum temperatures drop below 30 °C (86 °F) by late October and there is a gradual fall in average temperature. Minimum temperature drops below 20 °C (68 °F).[23] During Autumn, the wind direction begins changing from South-Westerly to North-Westerly. In recent decades, Delhi has seen a hazardous increase in air pollution levels and haze in the months of October and November caused by stubble burning by farmers in the Indian states lying north of Delhi for fresh sowing at this time of the year, which is exacerbated by the usually almost still air around this time that causes the pollutants to hang in Delhi's air for many days. Around late autumn, the variation between morning and afternoon temperatures in a day becomes considerable, and can often be more than 20 °C (68 °F), with minimum dropping to under 10 °C (50 °F) and maximum still hovering slightly under 30 °C (86 °F). This season ends by early December.\n\n\n\n### Winter[edit]\n\n\nWinter arrives in Delhi by early December. Minimum temperatures gradually enter single digits by this time of the year, while days are cool. Though usually not cold initially, December suddenly becomes cold in the latter half, as chilly north-western winds from the Himalayas begin sweeping the Northern Plains. These cold waves are caused by a depression created by Western Disturbance, which bring cloud cover and winter rains to the Plains, and add to snowfall in the North-Western Indian Subcontinent. By early January, when winter peaks in Delhi, the minimum temperatures plunge to the vicinity of 0 °C (32 °F),[24][25][26] though very rarely entering the negative scale. Maximum temperatures, too may drop down into single digits[27][28] and always stay under 15 °C (59 °F). When the minimum temperature ventures very close to the 0 °C (32 °F) mark, Delhi witnesses frost.[29] Snow is a practical impossibility for Delhi (and the rest of Northern Plains) due to very dry nature of its winter- the coldest conditions happen under clear skies when icy winds rush in from the Himalayas, and a cloud cover (which is necessary for causing snowfall) rather warms the city by trapping heat, thereby junking any possibility of snow. Delhi's winter is marked by very dense fog and haze, which dramatically reduce visibility[30] and makes days colder by cutting off sunlight. In the opposite scenario, cold north-westerly winds from the upper reaches of Himalayas blowing across the city makes the days feel colder, despite any sunshine and the nights further cold.[31] Post mid-January, average temperatures begin to rise very gradually, though the rise is almost contained by the cold north-western winds which result due to very heavy snowfall that occurs in the Himalayas during this part of the month.[32] It may rain towards the end of January and the precipitation is usually accompanied by hail,[33] resulting in slight increase in minimum temperatures due to cloud cover. Maximum temperatures again cross 20 °C (68 °F) and days become pleasant.\nBy mid-February or somewhat beyond, minimum temperatures cross the 10 °C (50 °F) mark and days start getting warmer gradually, marking the end of winter.\nDelhi can sometimes have a prolonged season of chill, extending into March.[34][35][36]\n\n\n\n### Spring[edit]\n\n\nAround the middle of February, Delhi's climate sees another transition, this time from Winter to Summer. The transition weather is known as Spring and is characterized by warm days, cool nights, dry ambiance and lively natural surroundings.[37] The weather is pleasant and there is warm, brilliant sunshine during the day. For all its characteristics, in India it is referred to as \"Rituraaj\", meaning the King of Seasons.[38] Spring rains[39] are a characteristic of this season. These rains may be accompanied by hail and can be heavy. Average temperatures show a slow, gradual rise as the wind direction shift from North-West to South-West, thereby getting warmer. Around late spring/ early summer, the variation between morning and afternoon temperatures in a day becomes considerable, and can often be more than 20 °C (68 °F), with maximum rising to mid 30s °C (93–97 °F) and minimum in the mid 10s °C (57–61 °F). Spring ends by the latter half of March and the day temperatures exceed 30 °C (86 °F) by then,[40] marking the onset of the next summer.\n\n\n\n## Climate data[edit]\n\n\nTemperature records for Delhi exist for a period of a little over 100 years. The lowest ever temperature reading during this period is −2.2 °C (28.0 °F), recorded on 11 January 1967 at Met Delhi Palam. And, the highest ever temperature reading during the same period is 48.4 °C (119.1 °F) recorded in 26 May 1998, at Indira Gandhi International Airport, Delhi Palam.[4][41] The highest temperature ever recorded in June is 48.0 °C (118.4 °F) on 10 June 2019 at Met Indira Gandhi International Airport, Palam. The highest & lowest ever temperature recorded at Safdarjung are 47.2 °C (117.0 °F) on 29 May 1944 & −0.6 °C (30.9 °F) on 16 January 1935. The highest & lowest ever temperature recorded at Palam are 48.4 °C (119.1 °F) on 26 May 1998 & −2.2 °C (28.0 °F) on 11 January 1967.

The readings at Safdarjung station are taken as those for the city, whereas the readings at Palam station are taken as those for the Airport.\n\n\n\n## Day-length variation[edit]\n\n\nLocated at 28°36′36″N latitude, Delhi lies in the sub-tropical belt of earth's North Temperate geographical region, a few latitudes north of the Tropic of Cancer. As such the rotation of earth has its effect on the city's day-length, which shortens during winters and lengthens during summers. Between the two solstices, Delhi's day-length changes by about 4 hours, offset by some 2 hours each at sunrise and sunset.[82][83]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Delhi Climate\".

Delhi's version of a humid subtropical climate is markedly different from many other humid subtropical cities such as São Paulo, Houston, and Brisbane in that the city features dust storms (something more commonly seen in a desert climate) and wildfire haze (something seen in a Mediterranean climate) due to its semi-arid climate.[1]\n\n\nSummer starts in early April and peaks in late May or early June, with average temperatures near 38 °C (100 °F) although occasional heat waves can result in highs close to 45 °C (113 °F) on some days and therefore higher apparent temperature. The monsoon starts in late June and lasts until mid-September, with about 797.3 mm (31.39 inches)[2] of rain. The average temperatures are around 29 °C (84 °F), although they can vary from around 25 °C (77 °F) on rainy days to 35–40 °C (95–104 °F) during dry spells. The monsoons recede in late September, and the post-monsoon season continues till late October, with average temperatures sliding from 29 to 21 °C (84 to 70 °F).\n\n\nWinter starts in November and peaks in January, with average temperatures around 14 °C (57 °F). Although daytime temperatures are warm, Delhi's proximity to the Himalayas results in cold waves leading to lower apparent temperature due to wind chill. Delhi is notorious for its heavy fogs and haze during the winter season. In December, reduced visibility leads to disruption of road, air and rail traffic.[3] Winter ends by the first week of March.\n\n\nExtreme temperatures have ranged from −2.2 to 48.4 °C (28.0 to 119.1 °F).[4]\n\n\n\n\n## Classifications[edit]\n\n\n\n\nDelhi Climate according to major climate systems\n| Climatic scheme\n | Initials\n | Description\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Köppen system[5] | *Cwa* | Monsoon-influenced humid subtropical\n |\n| Trewartha system[6] | *Aw* | Tropical wet-and-dry |\n| Alisov system[7] | —\n | Sub-equatorial climate\n |\n| Strahler system[8] | —\n | Dry tropical semi-arid\n |\n| Thornthwaite system[9] | DA'd\n | Semi-arid and megathermal |\n| Neef system[10] | —\n | Tropical alternating climate equatorial climate\n |\n\n\n## Overview of seasonal distribution[edit]\n\n\n* Spring: February, March; warm days, cool nights, pleasant; low to moderate humidity; moderate precipitation\n* Summer: April, May, June; hot to very hot; very low to moderate humidity; low precipitation\n* Monsoon (Rainy): July, August, September; hot, pleasant during rains; high to very high humidity; heavy precipitation\n* Autumn: October, November; warm days, cool nights, pleasant; low humidity; low precipitation\n* Winter: December, January; cool days, cold nights; moderate humidity; medium precipitation\n\n\n## Seasons[edit]\n\n\nDelhi lies in the landlocked Northern Plains of the Indian Subcontinent. Its climate is greatly influenced by its proximity to the Himalayas and the Thar Desert, causing it to experience both weather extremes. Delhi has 5 distinct seasons, viz. Summer, Rainy, Autumn, Winter and Spring.[11] Broadly speaking, Delhi has long and scorching summers- sub-divided into dry summer and humid monsoon seasons, short and mildly cold winters, and two bouts of pleasant transition seasons. Two most important wind patterns influencing Delhi's climate are the Western Disturbance and the South-West Winds.\n\n\nDelhi experienced its coolest May in 36 years with excess rainfall, bringing the average maximum temperature down to 36.8°C, the lowest since 1987, according to the India Meteorological Department. [12] [13]\n\n\n\n### Summer[edit]\n\n\nSummer begins in early April and continues till the middle of June, with the heat peaking in late May and early June. It is characterized by extreme heat, low humidity, very hot winds and thunderstorms. Delhi's proximity to the Thar Desert results in hot, dry continental winds, called loo, at times blowing all across from the West Asian mainland, making the days feel hotter. These winds, blowing over from vast land stretches, are very hot and dry. Since the Western Disturbance depression moves eastward (and is the reason for cyclonic occurrences in Eastern Coastal areas) by this time of the year, there is no moisture-laden wind to increase humidity. The air therefore remains dry or very dry during day. For most of its summer season, Delhi has a semi-arid climate.[1] Coming from Spring, the city witnesses a spurt in day temperature around early April, whereas nights still remain pleasant. By the latter part of April or during early May, maximum temperatures exceed 40 °C (104 °F) while the ambience remains very dry. Night temperatures cross the 20 °C (68 °F) mark towards the latter part of April. May is Delhi's hottest month during which temperatures may reach 45 °C (113 °F) or higher.[14] This month is characterized by frequent thunderstorms.[15] Dust storms are another feature of Delhi's summer,[16][17] and can be severe and destructive when accompanied by strong winds, particularly under cumulonimbus formation.[18] These are caused due to fine dust brought along by the hot winds arriving from the desert. They make the surroundings appear pale yellow, bring temperatures slightly down and are usually followed by thunderstorms. Post mid-June, temperatures start falling slowly, while humidity shows a gradual rise.\nA visual characteristic of summer in Delhi is the summer bloom, particularly the blooming Bougainvillea, Amaltas, Gulmohar, Shireesh and Jacaranda trees, which look spectacular when fully flowering during peak summer in May.[19]\n\n\n\n### Monsoon[edit]\n\n\nMonsoon winds arrive in Delhi by either the end of June or the first week of July.[11] The arrival of moisture laden South-Western winds, traveling from the Arabian Sea marks the onset of the humid season in Delhi. This season is marked by high levels of humidity and high heat. Day temperatures drop below 40 °C (104 °F) as humidity suddenly soars.[20] July is marked by high heat and relatively less precipitation (as compared to August). This transition from scorching to sweltering heat between June and July makes the latter feel very uncomfortable. August is Delhi's wettest month. The heat is considerably reduced and it is relatively cooler for most part of the month. There is dense cloud formation in the sky and at least a week of distinct, heavy rainfall.[21] By September, the amount and frequency of precipitation drops, though humidity remains high.[22] Towards the end of September, moisture content in the air begins to fall and monsoon ends by early October. In India, the Rainy season is referred to as \"Rituraani\", meaning the Queen of Seasons.\n\n\n\n### Autumn[edit]\n\n\nThe end of monsoon marks the arrival of a transition season. Autumn arrives by early or mid October, and is marked by very dry ambiance, warm days and pleasant nights. Maximum temperatures drop below 30 °C (86 °F) by late October and there is a gradual fall in average temperature. Minimum temperature drops below 20 °C (68 °F).[23] During Autumn, the wind direction begins changing from South-Westerly to North-Westerly. In recent decades, Delhi has seen a hazardous increase in air pollution levels and haze in the months of October and November caused by stubble burning by farmers in the Indian states lying north of Delhi for fresh sowing at this time of the year, which is exacerbated by the usually almost still air around this time that causes the pollutants to hang in Delhi's air for many days. Around late autumn, the variation between morning and afternoon temperatures in a day becomes considerable, and can often be more than 20 °C (68 °F), with minimum dropping to under 10 °C (50 °F) and maximum still hovering slightly under 30 °C (86 °F). This season ends by early December.\n\n\n\n### Winter[edit]\n\n\nWinter arrives in Delhi by early December. Minimum temperatures gradually enter single digits by this time of the year, while days are cool. Though usually not cold initially, December suddenly becomes cold in the latter half, as chilly north-western winds from the Himalayas begin sweeping the Northern Plains. These cold waves are caused by a depression created by Western Disturbance, which bring cloud cover and winter rains to the Plains, and add to snowfall in the North-Western Indian Subcontinent. By early January, when winter peaks in Delhi, the minimum temperatures plunge to the vicinity of 0 °C (32 °F),[24][25][26] though very rarely entering the negative scale. Maximum temperatures, too may drop down into single digits[27][28] and always stay under 15 °C (59 °F). When the minimum temperature ventures very close to the 0 °C (32 °F) mark, Delhi witnesses frost.[29] Snow is a practical impossibility for Delhi (and the rest of Northern Plains) due to very dry nature of its winter- the coldest conditions happen under clear skies when icy winds rush in from the Himalayas, and a cloud cover (which is necessary for causing snowfall) rather warms the city by trapping heat, thereby junking any possibility of snow. Delhi's winter is marked by very dense fog and haze, which dramatically reduce visibility[30] and makes days colder by cutting off sunlight. In the opposite scenario, cold north-westerly winds from the upper reaches of Himalayas blowing across the city makes the days feel colder, despite any sunshine and the nights further cold.[31] Post mid-January, average temperatures begin to rise very gradually, though the rise is almost contained by the cold north-western winds which result due to very heavy snowfall that occurs in the Himalayas during this part of the month.[32] It may rain towards the end of January and the precipitation is usually accompanied by hail,[33] resulting in slight increase in minimum temperatures due to cloud cover. Maximum temperatures again cross 20 °C (68 °F) and days become pleasant.\nBy mid-February or somewhat beyond, minimum temperatures cross the 10 °C (50 °F) mark and days start getting warmer gradually, marking the end of winter.\nDelhi can sometimes have a prolonged season of chill, extending into March.[34][35][36]\n\n\n\n### Spring[edit]\n\n\nAround the middle of February, Delhi's climate sees another transition, this time from Winter to Summer. The transition weather is known as Spring and is characterized by warm days, cool nights, dry ambiance and lively natural surroundings.[37] The weather is pleasant and there is warm, brilliant sunshine during the day. For all its characteristics, in India it is referred to as \"Rituraaj\", meaning the King of Seasons.[38] Spring rains[39] are a characteristic of this season. These rains may be accompanied by hail and can be heavy. Average temperatures show a slow, gradual rise as the wind direction shift from North-West to South-West, thereby getting warmer. Around late spring/ early summer, the variation between morning and afternoon temperatures in a day becomes considerable, and can often be more than 20 °C (68 °F), with maximum rising to mid 30s °C (93–97 °F) and minimum in the mid 10s °C (57–61 °F). Spring ends by the latter half of March and the day temperatures exceed 30 °C (86 °F) by then,[40] marking the onset of the next summer.\n\n\n\n## Climate data[edit]\n\n\nTemperature records for Delhi exist for a period of a little over 100 years. The lowest ever temperature reading during this period is −2.2 °C (28.0 °F), recorded on 11 January 1967 at Met Delhi Palam. And, the highest ever temperature reading during the same period is 48.4 °C (119.1 °F) recorded in 26 May 1998, at Indira Gandhi International Airport, Delhi Palam.[4][41] The highest temperature ever recorded in June is 48.0 °C (118.4 °F) on 10 June 2019 at Met Indira Gandhi International Airport, Palam. The highest & lowest ever temperature recorded at Safdarjung are 47.2 °C (117.0 °F) on 29 May 1944 & −0.6 °C (30.9 °F) on 16 January 1935. The highest & lowest ever temperature recorded at Palam are 48.4 °C (119.1 °F) on 26 May 1998 & −2.2 °C (28.0 °F) on 11 January 1967. The highest & lowest ever temperature recorded at Ayanagar are 47.4 °C (117.3 °F) on 28 May 1988 & −1.3 °C (29.7 °F) on 22 January 1977. The highest & lowest ever temperature recorded at Delhi Ridge are 47.9 °C (118.2 °F) on 10 June 2019 & 1.5 °C (34.7 °F) on 7 January 2023.[42]\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nClimate data for New Delhi

The readings at Safdarjung station are taken as those for the city, whereas the readings at Palam station are taken as those for the Airport.\n\n\n\n## Day-length variation[edit]\n\n\nLocated at 28°36′36″N latitude, Delhi lies in the sub-tropical belt of earth's North Temperate geographical region, a few latitudes north of the Tropic of Cancer. As such the rotation of earth has its effect on the city's day-length, which shortens during winters and lengthens during summers. Between the two solstices, Delhi's day-length changes by about 4 hours, offset by some 2 hours each at sunrise and sunset.[82][83]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Delhi Climate\".

However, its climate varies from cool humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification *Dfb*) in the north such as northern Hokkaido, to warm tropical rainforest climate (Köppen climate classification *Af*) in the south such as the Yaeyama Islands and Minami-Tori-shima.\n\n\n\n\n## Climate zones[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kabira Bay on Ishigaki Island, Okinawa Prefecture in March\n![](image)Sakura blossoms with Himeji Castle in Hyōgo Prefecture in April\n![](image)Mount Yari, Nagano Prefecture in August\nJapan's varied geographical features divide it into six principal climatic zones.\n\n\n\n* Hokkaido belongs to the humid continental climate, with long, cold winters and cool summers. Precipitation is sparse; however, winter brings large snowfalls of hundreds of inches in areas such as Sapporo and Asahikawa.\n* In the Sea of Japan, the northwest seasonal wind in winter gives heavy snowfall, which south of Tōhoku mostly melts before the beginning of spring. In summer, it is a little less rainy than the Pacific area but sometimes experiences extreme high temperatures because of the foehn wind phenomenon.\n* Central Highland: a typical inland climate gives large temperature variations between summers and winters and between days and nights. Precipitation is lower than on the coast because of rain shadow effects.\n* Seto Inland Sea: the mountains in the Chūgoku and Shikoku regions block the seasonal winds and bring mild climate and many fine days throughout the year.\n* Pacific Ocean: the climate varies greatly between the north and the south, but generally winters are significantly milder and sunnier than those of the side that faces the Sea of Japan. Summers are hot because of the southeast seasonal wind. Precipitation is very heavy in the south and heavy in the summer in the north. The climate of the Ogasawara Islands ranges from a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification *Cfa*) to tropical savanna climate (Köppen climate classification *Aw*) with temperatures being warm to hot all year round.\n* The climate of the Ryukyu Islands ranges from a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification *Cfa*) in the north to a tropical rainforest climate (Köppen climate classification *Af*) in the south with warm winters and hot summers. Precipitation is very high and is especially affected by the rainy season and typhoons.\n\n\n## Precipitation[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | This section **needs expansion**. You can help by adding to it. *(September 2022)*\n |\n\n\nFurther information: East Asian Monsoon\n\nJapan is generally a rainy country with high humidity.[1] Because of its wide range of latitude,[1] seasonal winds and different types of ocean currents,[*citation needed*] Japan has a variety of climates, with a latitude range of the inhabited islands from 24°N – 46°N, which is comparable to the range between Nova Scotia and The Bahamas in the east coast of North America.[1] Tokyo is between 35°N – 36°N, which is comparable to that of Tehran, Athens, or Las Vegas.[1]\n\n\nAs Mount Fuji and the Japanese coastal Alps provide a rain shadow, Nagano and Yamanashi Prefectures receive the least precipitation in Honshu, though it still exceeds 900 millimetres (35 in) annually. A similar effect is found in Hokkaido, where Okhotsk Subprefecture receives as little as 750 millimetres (30 in) per year. All other prefectures have coasts on the Pacific Ocean, Sea of Japan, and Seto Inland Sea, or have a body of salt water connected to them. Two prefectures—Hokkaido and Okinawa—are composed entirely of islands.\n\n\n\n## Seasons[edit]\n\n\n### Summer[edit]\n\n\nThe climate from June to September is marked by hot, wet weather brought by tropical airflows from the Pacific Ocean and Southeast Asia.[1] These air flows are full of moisture and deposit substantial amounts of rain when they reach land.[1] There is a marked rainy season, beginning in early June and continuing for about a month.[1] It is followed by hot, sticky weather.[1] Five or six typhoons pass over or near Japan every year from early August to early October, sometimes resulting in significant damage.[1] Annual precipitation averages between 1,000 and 2,500 mm (40 and 100 in) except for the areas such as Kii Peninsula and Yakushima Island which is Japan's wettest place[2] with the annual precipitation is one of the world's highest at 4,000 to 10,000 mm.[3]\n\n\nMaximum precipitation, like the rest of East Asia, occurs in the summer months except on the Sea of Japan coast where strong northerly winds produce a maximum in late autumn and early winter. Except for a few sheltered inland valleys during December and January, precipitation in Japan is above 25 millimetres (1 in) of rainfall equivalent in all months of the year, and in the wettest coastal areas it is above 100 millimetres (4 in) per month throughout the year.\n\n\nMid-June to mid-July is generally the rainy season in Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu, excluding Hokkaidō since the seasonal rain front or *baiu zensen* (梅雨前線) dissipates in northern Honshu before reaching Hokkaido. In Okinawa, the rainy season starts early in May and continues until mid-June. Unlike the rainy season in mainland Japan, it rains neither every day nor all day long during the rainy season in Okinawa. Between July and October, typhoons, grown from tropical depressions generated near the equator, can attack Japan with furious rainstorms.\n\n\n\n### Winter[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Winter with frozen coniferous trees near Mt. Kumano in the Mount Zaō range in Miyagi Prefecture\nIn winter, the Siberian High develops over the Eurasian land mass and the Aleutian Low develops over the northern Pacific Ocean.[1] The result is a flow of cold air southeastward across Japan that brings freezing temperatures and heavy snowfalls to the central mountain ranges facing the Sea of Japan, but clear skies to areas fronting on the Pacific.[1]\n\n\nThe warmest winter temperatures are found in the Nanpō and Bonin Islands, which enjoy a tropical climate due to the combination of latitude, distance from the Asian continent, and warming effect of winds from the Kuroshio, as well as the Volcano Islands (at the latitude of the southernmost of the Ryukyu Islands, 24° N). The coolest summer temperatures are found on the northeastern coast of Hokkaidō in Kushiro and Nemuro Subprefectures.\n\n\n\n## Sunshine[edit]\n\n\nSunshine, in accordance with Japan's uniformly heavy rainfall, is generally modest in quantity, though no part of Japan receives the consistently gloomy fogs that envelope the Sichuan Basin or Taipei. Amounts range from about six hours per day on the Inland Sea coast and sheltered parts of the Pacific Coast and Kantō Plain to four hours per day on the Sea of Japan coast of Hokkaidō. In December there is a very pronounced sunshine gradient between the Sea of Japan and the Pacific coasts, as the former side can receive less than 30 hours and the Pacific side as much as 180 hours. In summer, however, sunshine hours are lowest on exposed parts of the Pacific coast where fogs from the Oyashio current create persistent cloud cover similar to that found on the Kuril Islands and Sakhalin.\n\n\n\n## Extreme temperature records[edit]\n\n\nThe highest recorded temperature in Japan was 41.1 °C (106.0 °F) on 23 July 2018, an unverified record of 42.7 °C was taken in Adachi, Tokyo on 20 July 2004. The high humidity and the maritime influence make temperatures in the 40s rare, with summers dominated by a more stable subtropical monsoon pattern through most of Japan. The lowest was −41.0 °C (−41.8 °F) in Asahikawa on 25 January 1902. However an unofficial −41.5 °C was taken in Bifuka on 27 January 1931. Mount Fuji broke the Japanese record lows for each month except January, February, March, and December. Record lows for any month were taken as recently as 1984.\n\n\nMinami-Tori-shima has a tropical savanna climate (Köppen climate classification *Aw*) and the highest average temperature in Japan of 25 degrees Celsius.[4]\n\n\n\n## Climate data[edit]\n\n\n| Climate data for Japan\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n |

A similar effect is found in Hokkaido, where Okhotsk Subprefecture receives as little as 750 millimetres (30 in) per year. All other prefectures have coasts on the Pacific Ocean, Sea of Japan, and Seto Inland Sea, or have a body of salt water connected to them. Two prefectures—Hokkaido and Okinawa—are composed entirely of islands.\n\n\n\n## Seasons[edit]\n\n\n### Summer[edit]\n\n\nThe climate from June to September is marked by hot, wet weather brought by tropical airflows from the Pacific Ocean and Southeast Asia.[1] These air flows are full of moisture and deposit substantial amounts of rain when they reach land.[1] There is a marked rainy season, beginning in early June and continuing for about a month.[1] It is followed by hot, sticky weather.[1] Five or six typhoons pass over or near Japan every year from early August to early October, sometimes resulting in significant damage.[1] Annual precipitation averages between 1,000 and 2,500 mm (40 and 100 in) except for the areas such as Kii Peninsula and Yakushima Island which is Japan's wettest place[2] with the annual precipitation is one of the world's highest at 4,000 to 10,000 mm.[3]\n\n\nMaximum precipitation, like the rest of East Asia, occurs in the summer months except on the Sea of Japan coast where strong northerly winds produce a maximum in late autumn and early winter. Except for a few sheltered inland valleys during December and January, precipitation in Japan is above 25 millimetres (1 in) of rainfall equivalent in all months of the year, and in the wettest coastal areas it is above 100 millimetres (4 in) per month throughout the year.\n\n\nMid-June to mid-July is generally the rainy season in Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu, excluding Hokkaidō since the seasonal rain front or *baiu zensen* (梅雨前線) dissipates in northern Honshu before reaching Hokkaido. In Okinawa, the rainy season starts early in May and continues until mid-June. Unlike the rainy season in mainland Japan, it rains neither every day nor all day long during the rainy season in Okinawa. Between July and October, typhoons, grown from tropical depressions generated near the equator, can attack Japan with furious rainstorms.\n\n\n\n### Winter[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Winter with frozen coniferous trees near Mt. Kumano in the Mount Zaō range in Miyagi Prefecture\nIn winter, the Siberian High develops over the Eurasian land mass and the Aleutian Low develops over the northern Pacific Ocean.[1] The result is a flow of cold air southeastward across Japan that brings freezing temperatures and heavy snowfalls to the central mountain ranges facing the Sea of Japan, but clear skies to areas fronting on the Pacific.[1]\n\n\nThe warmest winter temperatures are found in the Nanpō and Bonin Islands, which enjoy a tropical climate due to the combination of latitude, distance from the Asian continent, and warming effect of winds from the Kuroshio, as well as the Volcano Islands (at the latitude of the southernmost of the Ryukyu Islands, 24° N). The coolest summer temperatures are found on the northeastern coast of Hokkaidō in Kushiro and Nemuro Subprefectures.\n\n\n\n## Sunshine[edit]\n\n\nSunshine, in accordance with Japan's uniformly heavy rainfall, is generally modest in quantity, though no part of Japan receives the consistently gloomy fogs that envelope the Sichuan Basin or Taipei. Amounts range from about six hours per day on the Inland Sea coast and sheltered parts of the Pacific Coast and Kantō Plain to four hours per day on the Sea of Japan coast of Hokkaidō. In December there is a very pronounced sunshine gradient between the Sea of Japan and the Pacific coasts, as the former side can receive less than 30 hours and the Pacific side as much as 180 hours. In summer, however, sunshine hours are lowest on exposed parts of the Pacific coast where fogs from the Oyashio current create persistent cloud cover similar to that found on the Kuril Islands and Sakhalin.\n\n\n\n## Extreme temperature records[edit]\n\n\nThe highest recorded temperature in Japan was 41.1 °C (106.0 °F) on 23 July 2018, an unverified record of 42.7 °C was taken in Adachi, Tokyo on 20 July 2004. The high humidity and the maritime influence make temperatures in the 40s rare, with summers dominated by a more stable subtropical monsoon pattern through most of Japan. The lowest was −41.0 °C (−41.8 °F) in Asahikawa on 25 January 1902. However an unofficial −41.5 °C was taken in Bifuka on 27 January 1931. Mount Fuji broke the Japanese record lows for each month except January, February, March, and December.

It ranges from tropical in the far south to subarctic in the far north, and alpine in the higher elevations of the Tibetan Plateau. Monsoon winds, caused by differences in the heat-absorbing capacity of the continent and the ocean, dominate the climate. During the summer, the East Asian Monsoon carries warm and moist air from the south and delivers the vast majority of the annual precipitation in much of the country. Conversely, the Siberian anticyclone dominates during winter, bringing cold and comparatively dry conditions. The advance and retreat of the monsoons account, in large degree, for the timing of the rainy season throughout the country. Although most of the country lies in the temperate belt, its climatic patterns are complex.\n\n\nSanbao Township in Xinjiang currently holds the highest recorded temperature in China, at 52.2 °C (126.0 °F) on 16 July 2023.[1][2] Mohe City, Heilongjiang, holds the record for the lowest temperature in China, at −53.0 °C (−63.4 °F) on 22 January 2023.[3][4]\n\n\n\n\n## Overview[edit]\n\n\n### Temperature[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hardiness zones in China\nThe northern extremities of both Heilongjiang and Inner Mongolia have a subarctic climate[5] with long, severe winters, and short, warm summers.[6] In contrast, most of Hainan Island and parts of the extreme southern fringes of Yunnan have a tropical climate.[5] Temperature differences in winter are considerable, but in summer, the variance is considerably less. For example, Mohe County, Heilongjiang, has a 24-hour average temperature in January approaching −30 °C (−22 °F), while the corresponding figure in July exceeds 18 °C (64 °F).[7] By contrast, most of Hainan, including the city of Haikou, has a January mean over 18 °C (64 °F), while the July mean there is generally around 29 °C (84 °F).[8]\n\n\nIn summer, temperatures can be very hot and humid, and the cities of Chongqing, Wuhan, and Nanjing are sometimes referred to as the Three Furnaces (simplified Chinese: 三大火炉; traditional Chinese: 三大火爐; pinyin: *sān dà huǒlú*).[9] Other cities are also known by this name.[10] Even so, the hottest temperatures nationwide are recorded in the Turpan Depression, where the climate is much drier and temperatures often exceed 40 °C (104 °F).[11][12]\n\n\nPermafrost can be found at high elevations in the Tibetan Plateau and the Tian Shan mountains,[13][14] as well as other mountainous areas in Northern China.[14]\n\n\n\n### Precipitation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The average annual precipitation in Mainland China\nIn the winter, northern winds coming from high-latitude areas are cold and dry, while in summer, southern winds from coastal areas at lower latitudes are warm and moist.[15] Precipitation is almost always concentrated in the warmer months, though annual totals range from less than 20 millimetres (0.8 in) in northwestern Qinghai and the Turpan Depression of Xinjiang, to over 2,000 millimetres (79 in) in areas of southeast China, such as Hong Kong and Guangdong. Toksun County, located in the Turpan Depression, has an average rainfall of just 3.9 mm (0.15 in) annually, the lowest precipitation in any area in China.[16] High pressure cells create cold, dry conditions in the Gobi Desert in winter.[17] Only in some pockets of the Dzungaria region of Xinjiang is the conspicuous seasonal variation in precipitation that defines Chinese (and, to a large extent, East Asian) climate absent. The East Asian Monsoon, which controls the seasonal precipitation, varies from year to year.[18] It has historically been known as the plum rain.[19][20] Scientists have used pollen and dust to track its movements.[21][22]\n\n\n\n#### Typhoons and flooding[edit]\n\n\nTyphoons can affect China. In 1975, Typhoon Nina struck China, and may have killed up to 230,000 people as a result of the subsequent Banqiao Dam failure and famines.[23][24] Other death estimates remain below 100,000.[25] In 2006, Typhoon Saomai became one of the strongest typhoons to hit China when it made landfall in Zhejiang.[26][27] In 2013, Typhoon Haiyan caused extensive damage in China,[28] causing economic losses of ¥4.58 billion (US$752 million).[29] That same year, Typhoon Fitow became one of the costliest typhoons to strike China,[30][31] with several places setting rainfall records.[32][33] It was the costliest Chinese typhoon on record and caused several billion dollars in damage before it was beaten 10 years later by Typhoon Doksuri.[34] In 2018, Typhoon Mangkhut caused $1.99 billion in damage within China.[29] In 2021, Typhoon In-fa caused record-breaking rainfall in parts of China,[35][36] and over 12,000 temporary shelters had to be set up in Zhejiang.[37] In 2022, Typhoon Muifa became the strongest typhoon to landfall in Shanghai.[38]\n\n\nDuring the wet season, typhoons and heavy rainfall can cause rivers to flood. The 1931 China floods are considered to be the worst Chinese natural disaster of all time, with estimates of fatalities ranging widely but going up to as high as four million people.[39][40] 15% of wheat and rice crops were destroyed in the Yangtze Valley, leading to famines.[41] Almost 800,000 in Wuhan were left homeless after a dike failure in July 1931.[42]: 270 The city was flooded under water for nearly three months.[42]: 269–270 The city of Nanjing was also severely affected,[43] and tens of thousands of people died in Gaoyou alone.[44] Other major floods include the 1954 Yangtze River Floods, which killed around 30,000 people,[45] the 1998 China floods, which caused significant damage and affected 180 million people,[45][46] and the 2020 China floods, which caused US$32 billion in damage.[47][48]\n\n\n\n### Sunshine[edit]\n\n\nAnnual sunshine duration ranges from less than 1,000 hours in parts of Sichuan and Chongqing[49] to over 3,000 hours in parts of Xinjiang and Qinghai, including Golmud.[50] Some areas of Tibet, including Lhasa, are also sunny. Seasonal patterns in sunshine vary considerably by region, but overall, the north and the Tibetan Plateau are sunnier than the south of the country. In some cities in southern China, such as Hong Kong, spring is the cloudiest season and autumn is the sunniest.[51]\n\n\n\n## Environmental issues[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Great Green Wall (China)\n\n![](image)Air pollution caused by industrial plants (a factory at the Yangtze River)\nIn 2020, China ranked 120th out of 180 countries in the Environmental Performance Index.[52] The government has taken actions to mitigate environmental issues, but some media has criticized the actions as inadequate.[53]\n\n\nA major environmental issue in China is the continued expansion of its deserts, particularly the Gobi Desert.[54][55] Although barrier tree lines planted since the 1970s have reduced the frequency of sandstorms, prolonged drought and poor agricultural practices have resulted in dust storms plaguing northern China each spring, which then spread to other parts of East Asia, including Japan and Korea. China's environmental watchdog, SEPA, stated in 2007 that China is losing 4,000 km2 (1,500 sq mi) per year to desertification.[56] Water quality, erosion, and pollution control have become important issues in China's relations with other countries. Melting glaciers in the Himalayas could potentially lead to water shortages for hundreds of millions of people.[57] According to academics, in order to limit climate change in China to 1.5 °C (2.7 °F), electricity generation from coal in China without carbon capture must be phased out by 2045.[58] Official government statistics about Chinese agricultural productivity are considered unreliable, due to exaggeration of production at subsidiary government levels.[59][60]\n\n\nMuch of China has a climate very suitable for agriculture and the country has been the world's largest producer of rice, wheat, tomatoes, eggplant, grapes, watermelon, spinach, and many other crops.[61]\n\n\n\n## Examples[edit]\n\n\n### Northeast China[edit]\n\n\n| Climate data for Beijing (1991–2020

major effects on the Chinese economy, society and the environment.[101][102] China is the largest emitter of carbon dioxide, through an energy infrastructure heavily focused on coal. Other industries, such as a burgeoning construction industry and industrial manufacturing, contribute heavily to carbon emissions. However, like other developing countries, on a per-capita basis, China's carbon emissions are considerably less than countries like the United States.[103] It has also been noted that higher-income countries have outsourced emissions-intensive industries to China.[104][105] On the basis of cumulative CO2 emissions measured from 1751 through to 2017, China is responsible for 13% globally and about half of the United States' cumulative emissions.[106][107] China is now the world's largest polluter and in 2023 recorded its hottest year on record with an average temperature of 10.7 C.[108]\n\n\n\nChina is suffering from the negative effects of global warming in agriculture, forestry and water resources, and is expected to continue to see increased impacts. China's government is taking some measures to increase renewable energy, and other decarbonization efforts, vowing to hit peak emissions before 2030 and be carbon neutral by 2060 by adopting \"more vigorous policies and measures.\"[109] The GHG emissions of China will probably peak in 2025, and by 2030 they will return to 2022 levels. However, such pathway still leads to 3 degree temperature rise.[110]\n\n## Gallery[edit]\n\n\n* ![Typhoon Saomai was one of the most powerful typhoons to hit China.[26]](image)\n\nTyphoon Saomai was one of the most powerful typhoons to hit China.[26]\n* ![Typhoon Nina on August 2 1975.](image)\n\nTyphoon Nina on August 2 1975.\n* ![Flooding in China during the 1931 floods](image)\n\nFlooding in China during the 1931 floods\n* ![Early-season snow covering part of the North China Plain near Shijiazhuang, Hebei](image)\n\nEarly-season snow covering part of the North China Plain near Shijiazhuang, Hebei\n* ![Snow encircling the area around the Bo Hai](image)\n\nSnow encircling the area around the Bo Hai\n* ![A sandstorm blowing from Inner Mongolia in 2010](image)\n\nA sandstorm blowing from Inner Mongolia in 2010\n* ![Haze over the North China Plain and the Lüliang Mountains of Shanxi](image)\n\nHaze over the North China Plain and the Lüliang Mountains of Shanxi\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Geography of China\n* Climate change in China\n* Environmental issues in China\n* Geography of Taiwan\n* East Asia\n* East Asian Monsoon\n* Hot summer cold winter zone\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Mean monthly maxima and minima (i.e. the expected highest and lowest temperature readings at any point during the year or given month) calculated based on data in Hong Kong from 1991 to 2020.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"China logs 52.2 Celsius as extreme weather rewrites records\". *Reuters*. 2023-07-17.

It ranges from tropical in the far south to subarctic in the far north, and alpine in the higher elevations of the Tibetan Plateau. Monsoon winds, caused by differences in the heat-absorbing capacity of the continent and the ocean, dominate the climate. During the summer, the East Asian Monsoon carries warm and moist air from the south and delivers the vast majority of the annual precipitation in much of the country. Conversely, the Siberian anticyclone dominates during winter, bringing cold and comparatively dry conditions. The advance and retreat of the monsoons account, in large degree, for the timing of the rainy season throughout the country. Although most of the country lies in the temperate belt, its climatic patterns are complex.\n\n\nSanbao Township in Xinjiang currently holds the highest recorded temperature in China, at 52.2 °C (126.0 °F) on 16 July 2023.[1][2] Mohe City, Heilongjiang, holds the record for the lowest temperature in China, at −53.0 °C (−63.4 °F) on 22 January 2023.[3][4]\n\n\n\n\n## Overview[edit]\n\n\n### Temperature[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hardiness zones in China\nThe northern extremities of both Heilongjiang and Inner Mongolia have a subarctic climate[5] with long, severe winters, and short, warm summers.[6] In contrast, most of Hainan Island and parts of the extreme southern fringes of Yunnan have a tropical climate.[5] Temperature differences in winter are considerable, but in summer, the variance is considerably less. For example, Mohe County, Heilongjiang, has a 24-hour average temperature in January approaching −30 °C (−22 °F), while the corresponding figure in July exceeds 18 °C (64 °F).[7] By contrast, most of Hainan, including the city of Haikou, has a January mean over 18 °C (64 °F), while the July mean there is generally around 29 °C (84 °F).[8]\n\n\nIn summer, temperatures can be very hot and humid, and the cities of Chongqing, Wuhan, and Nanjing are sometimes referred to as the Three Furnaces (simplified Chinese: 三大火炉; traditional Chinese: 三大火爐; pinyin: *sān dà huǒlú*).[9] Other cities are also known by this name.[10] Even so, the hottest temperatures nationwide are recorded in the Turpan Depression, where the climate is much drier and temperatures often exceed 40 °C (104 °F).[11][12]\n\n\nPermafrost can be found at high elevations in the Tibetan Plateau and the Tian Shan mountains,[13][14] as well as other mountainous areas in Northern China.[14]\n\n\n\n### Precipitation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The average annual precipitation in Mainland China\nIn the winter, northern winds coming from high-latitude areas are cold and dry, while in summer, southern winds from coastal areas at lower latitudes are warm and moist.[15] Precipitation is almost always concentrated in the warmer months, though annual totals range from less than 20 millimetres (0.8 in) in northwestern Qinghai and the Turpan Depression of Xinjiang, to over 2,000 millimetres (79 in) in areas of southeast China, such as Hong Kong and Guangdong. Toksun County, located in the Turpan Depression, has an average rainfall of just 3.9 mm (0.15 in) annually, the lowest precipitation in any area in China.[16] High pressure cells create cold, dry conditions in the Gobi Desert in winter.[17] Only in some pockets of the Dzungaria region of Xinjiang is the conspicuous seasonal variation in precipitation that defines Chinese (and, to a large extent, East Asian) climate absent. The East Asian Monsoon, which controls the seasonal precipitation, varies from year to year.[18] It has historically been known as the plum rain.[19][20] Scientists have used pollen and dust to track its movements.[21][22]\n\n\n\n#### Typhoons and flooding[edit]\n\n\nTyphoons can affect China. In 1975, Typhoon Nina struck China, and may have killed up to 230,000 people as a result of the subsequent Banqiao Dam failure and famines.[23][24] Other death estimates remain below 100,000.[25] In 2006, Typhoon Saomai became one of the strongest typhoons to hit China when it made landfall in Zhejiang.[26][27] In 2013, Typhoon Haiyan caused extensive damage in China,[28] causing economic losses of ¥4.58 billion (US$752 million).[29] That same year, Typhoon Fitow became one of the costliest typhoons to strike China,[30][31] with several places setting rainfall records.[32][33] It was the costliest Chinese typhoon on record and caused several billion dollars in damage before it was beaten 10 years later by Typhoon Doksuri.[34] In 2018, Typhoon Mangkhut caused $1.99 billion in damage within China.[29] In 2021, Typhoon In-fa caused record-breaking rainfall in parts of China,[35][36] and over 12,000 temporary shelters had to be set up in Zhejiang.[37] In 2022, Typhoon Muifa became the strongest typhoon to landfall in Shanghai.[38]\n\n\nDuring the wet season, typhoons and heavy rainfall can cause rivers to flood. The 1931 China floods are considered to be the worst Chinese natural disaster of all time, with estimates of fatalities ranging widely but going up to as high as four million people.[39][40] 15% of wheat and rice crops were destroyed in the Yangtze Valley, leading to famines.[41] Almost 800,000 in Wuhan were left homeless after a dike failure in July 1931.[42]: 270 The city was flooded under water for nearly three months.[42]: 269–270 The city of Nanjing was also severely affected,[43] and tens of thousands of people died in Gaoyou alone.[44] Other major floods include the 1954 Yangtze River Floods, which killed around 30,000 people,[45] the 1998 China floods, which caused significant damage and affected 180 million people,[45][46] and the 2020 China floods, which caused US$32 billion in damage.[47][48]\n\n\n\n### Sunshine[edit]\n\n\nAnnual sunshine duration ranges from less than 1,000 hours in parts of Sichuan and Chongqing[49] to over 3,000 hours in parts of Xinjiang and Qinghai, including Golmud.[50] Some areas of Tibet, including Lhasa, are also sunny. Seasonal patterns in sunshine vary considerably by region, but overall, the north and the Tibetan Plateau are sunnier than the south of the country. In some cities in southern China, such as Hong Kong, spring is the cloudiest season and autumn is the sunniest.[51]\n\n\n\n## Environmental issues[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Great Green Wall (China)\n\n![](image)Air pollution caused by industrial plants (a factory at the Yangtze River)\nIn 2020, China ranked 120th out of 180 countries in the Environmental Performance Index.[52] The government has taken actions to mitigate environmental issues, but some media has criticized the actions as inadequate.[53]\n\n\nA major environmental issue in China is the continued expansion of its deserts, particularly the Gobi Desert.[54][55] Although barrier tree lines planted since the 1970s have reduced the frequency of sandstorms, prolonged drought and poor agricultural practices have resulted in dust storms plaguing northern China each spring, which then spread to other parts of East Asia, including Japan and Korea. China's environmental watchdog, SEPA, stated in 2007 that China is losing 4,000 km2 (1,500 sq mi) per year to desertification.[56] Water quality, erosion, and pollution control have become important issues in China's relations with other countries. Melting glaciers in the Himalayas could potentially lead to water shortages for hundreds of millions of people.[57] According to academics, in order to limit climate change in China to 1.5 °C (2.7 °F), electricity generation from coal in China without carbon capture must be phased out by 2045.[58] Official government statistics about Chinese agricultural productivity are considered unreliable, due to exaggeration of production at subsidiary government levels.[59][60]\n\n\nMuch of China has a climate very suitable for agriculture and the country has been the world's largest producer of rice, wheat, tomatoes, eggplant, grapes, watermelon, spinach, and many other crops.[61]\n\n\n\n## Examples[edit]\n\n\n### Northeast China[edit]\n\n\n| Climate data for Beijing (1991–2020

major effects on the Chinese economy, society and the environment.[101][102] China is the largest emitter of carbon dioxide, through an energy infrastructure heavily focused on coal. Other industries, such as a burgeoning construction industry and industrial manufacturing, contribute heavily to carbon emissions. However, like other developing countries, on a per-capita basis, China's carbon emissions are considerably less than countries like the United States.[103] It has also been noted that higher-income countries have outsourced emissions-intensive industries to China.[104][105] On the basis of cumulative CO2 emissions measured from 1751 through to 2017, China is responsible for 13% globally and about half of the United States' cumulative emissions.[106][107] China is now the world's largest polluter and in 2023 recorded its hottest year on record with an average temperature of 10.7 C.[108]\n\n\n\nChina is suffering from the negative effects of global warming in agriculture, forestry and water resources, and is expected to continue to see increased impacts. China's government is taking some measures to increase renewable energy, and other decarbonization efforts, vowing to hit peak emissions before 2030 and be carbon neutral by 2060 by adopting \"more vigorous policies and measures.\"[109] The GHG emissions of China will probably peak in 2025, and by 2030 they will return to 2022 levels. However, such pathway still leads to 3 degree temperature rise.[110]\n\n## Gallery[edit]\n\n\n* ![Typhoon Saomai was one of the most powerful typhoons to hit China.[26]](image)\n\nTyphoon Saomai was one of the most powerful typhoons to hit China.[26]\n* ![Typhoon Nina on August 2 1975.](image)\n\nTyphoon Nina on August 2 1975.\n* ![Flooding in China during the 1931 floods](image)\n\nFlooding in China during the 1931 floods\n* ![Early-season snow covering part of the North China Plain near Shijiazhuang, Hebei](image)\n\nEarly-season snow covering part of the North China Plain near Shijiazhuang, Hebei\n* ![Snow encircling the area around the Bo Hai](image)\n\nSnow encircling the area around the Bo Hai\n* ![A sandstorm blowing from Inner Mongolia in 2010](image)\n\nA sandstorm blowing from Inner Mongolia in 2010\n* ![Haze over the North China Plain and the Lüliang Mountains of Shanxi](image)\n\nHaze over the North China Plain and the Lüliang Mountains of Shanxi\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Geography of China\n* Climate change in China\n* Environmental issues in China\n* Geography of Taiwan\n* East Asia\n* East Asian Monsoon\n* Hot summer cold winter zone\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Mean monthly maxima and minima (i.e. the expected highest and lowest temperature readings at any point during the year or given month) calculated based on data in Hong Kong from 1991 to 2020.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"China logs 52.2 Celsius as extreme weather rewrites records\". *Reuters*. 2023-07-17.
