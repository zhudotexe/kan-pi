Schueller formulated and manufactured his own products, which he then decided to sell to Parisian hairdressers.[5][6] On 31 July 1909, Schueller registered his company,[7] the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Fran\u00e7aise de Teintures Inoffensives pour Cheveux (Safe Hair Dye Company of France). The guiding principles of the company, which eventually became L'Or\u00e9al, were research and innovation in the field of beauty. In 1920, the company employed three chemists; the team continued to grow with 100 by the year 1950, and 1,000 by the year 1984; as recently as 2021, there was an estimated total of 85,252 worldwide.[8]\n\n\nSchueller provided financial support and held meetings for La Cagoule at L'Or\u00e9al headquarters. La Cagoule was a violent French fascist-leaning and anti-communist group whose leader formed a political party Mouvement Social R\u00e9volutionnaire (MSR, Social Revolutionary Movement), which in Occupied France supported the Vichy collaboration with the Germans.[9] L'Or\u00e9al hired several members of the group as executives after World War II, such as Jacques Corr\u00e8ze, who served as CEO of the United States operation.[10][11]\n\n\nL'Or\u00e9al got its start in the hair-color business, but the company soon branched out into other cleansing and beauty products. L'Or\u00e9al currently markets over 500 brands and thousands of individual products in all sectors of the beauty business: hair color, permanents, hair styling, body and skincare, cleansers, makeup, and fragrance. The company's products are found in a wide variety of distribution channels, from hair salons and perfumeries to supermarkets, health/beauty outlets, pharmacies, and direct mail.[5][6]\n\n\n\n### Recent History[edit]\n\n\nIn 2017, Liliane Bettencourt the daughter of the founder of L'Oreal, passed away and left the business to her daughter, Francoise Bettencourt Meyers.[5]\n\n\n\n### Media[edit]\n\n\nIn 1988\u201389, L'Or\u00e9al controlled the film company Paravisi\u00f3n, whose properties included the Filmation and De Laurentiis libraries. StudioCanal acquired the Paravision properties in 1994.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Acquisitions[edit]\n\n\nL'Or\u00e9al currently owns 36 brands and continues to grow. As of October 4, 2021, the company registered 497 patents.[12]\n\n\nL'Or\u00e9al purchased Synth\u00e9labo in 1973 to pursue its ambitions in the pharmaceutical field. Synth\u00e9labo merged with Sanofi in 1999 to become Sanofi-Synth\u00e9labo. Sanofi-Synth\u00e9labo merged with Aventis in 2004 to become Sanofi-Aventis.[13]\n\n\nOn 17 March 2006, L'Or\u00e9al purchased cosmetics company The Body Shop for \u00a3562 million.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn May 2008, L'Or\u00e9al acquired YSL Beaut\u00e9 for $1.8 billion.[14]\n\n\nIn January 2014, L'Or\u00e9al finalized the acquisition of major Chinese beauty brand Magic Holdings for $840 million.[15]\n\n\nIn February 2014, L'Or\u00e9al agreed to buy back 8% of its shares for \u20ac3.4bn from Nestl\u00e9. As a result, Nestl\u00e9's stake in L'Or\u00e9al was reduced from 29.4% to 23.29%, while the Bettencourt Meyers family's stake increased from 30.6% to 33.2%. Nestl\u00e9 has owned a stake in L'Oreal since 1974, when it bought into the company at the request of Liliane Bettencourt, the daughter of the founder of L'Oreal, who was trying to prevent French state intervention.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn February 2014, Shiseido agreed to sell its Carita and Decl\u00e9or brands to L'Or\u00e9al for \u20ac227.5 million (US$312.93 million (2014)).[16]\n\n\nIn June 2014, L'Or\u00e9al agreed to acquire NYX Cosmetics for an undisclosed price, bolstering its makeup offerings in North America, where its consumer-products unit has faltered.[17]\n\n\nIn September 2014, L'Or\u00e9al announced it had agreed to purchase Brazilian hair care company Niely Cosmeticos Group for an undisclosed amount.[18]\n\n\nIn September 2014, L'Or\u00e9al acquired the multi-cultural brand Carol's Daughter.[19]\n\n\nIn July 2016, L'Or\u00e9al agreed to acquire IT Cosmetics for $1.2 billion.[20]\n\n\nIn March 2018, L'Or\u00e9al acquired the beauty augmented reality company ModiFace.[21]\n\n\nIn May 2018, L'Or\u00e9al announced a new beauty and fragrance partnership with Valentino.[22]\n\n\nIn December 2020, L'Or\u00e9al announced signing of an agreement for the acquisition of Takami Co, a Japanese company that markets the a premium skincare brand Takami, particularly famous for its iconic product, the Skin Peel pre-serum.[23]\n\n\nIn December 2021, L'Or\u00e9al announced the acquisition of the vegan skincare brand Youth to the People.[24][25]\n\n\nIn April 2023, L'Or\u00e9al purchased Australian luxury cosmetics brand Aesop for US$2.53 billion.[26][27][28] In August 2023, it was announced the acquisition had been completed.[29]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\nIn Kosovo, during the growth years of the mail-order business, L'Or\u00e9al and 3 Suisses founded Le Club des Cr\u00e9ateurs de Beaut\u00e9 for mail-order sales of cosmetic products, with brands including Agn\u00e8s b., Commence and Professeur Christine Poelman among others. In March 2008, L'Or\u00e9al acquired 3 Suisse's stake, taking sole control of the company.[30] In November 2013, L'Or\u00e9al announced that Le Club des Cr\u00e9ateurs de Beaut\u00e9 would cease activity in the first half of 2014.[31]\n\n\nSince 1997, L'Or\u00e9al has been an official partner of The Cannes Film Festival.[32] In the years of L'Or\u00e9al sponsorship, many L'Or\u00e9al ambassadors walked the red carpet of the Cannes Film Festival. In 2017, L'Or\u00e9al beauty ambassadors, including Julianne Moore, Susan Sarandon, Andie MacDowell, and Eva Longoria, were responsible for the film selection for the outdoor cinema during the Cannes Film Festival.[33]\n\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's advertising slogan, \"Because I'm worth it\", was created by a 23-year-old English art director and introduced in 1973 by the model and actress Joanne Dusseau.[34] In the mid-2000s, this was replaced by \"Because you're worth it\". In late-2009, the slogan was changed again to \"Because we're worth it\".\n\n\nIn November 2012, L'Or\u00e9al inaugurated the largest factory in the Jababeka Industrial Park, Cikarang, Indonesia, with a total investment of US$100 million.[35] The production will be absorbed 25 percent by the domestic market and the rest will be exported. In 2010, significant growth occurred in Indonesia with a 61 percent increase of unit sales or 28 percent of net sales.[36]\n\n\nIn November 2020, chief digital officer Lubomira Rochet reported in a video conference of the growing importance of e-commerce for the company, remarking that e-commerce makes 24% of their turnover in the third quarter of the year. Rochet stated as well that this 24% of the turnover \"made it possible to offset 50% of the losses due to the closing of physical stores this year\".[37]\n\n\nIn 2023, the L'Or\u00e9al Foundation and UNESCO presented a medal of honor and a financial endowment to three women researchers who had to leave their countries, and whose courage, resilience and commitment to science are considered inspriing.[38][39][40]\n\n\n\n## List of spokespeople[edit]\n\n\nL'Or\u00e9al Paris has a group of ambassadors, artists, actresses, and activists referred to as the L'Or\u00e9al Paris \"Dream Team\".[41]\n\n\n\n* Laetitia Casta (1998\u2013present)[42]\n* Eva Longoria (2005\u2013present)[43]\n* Aishwarya Rai (2004\u2013present)\n* Helen Mirren (2014\u2013present)[44][45]\n* Luma Grothe (2015\u2013present)[46]\n* Soo Joo (2015\u2013present)[47]\n* Aja Naomi King (2017\u2013present)[48]\n* Camilla Cabello (2017\u2013present)[49]\n* Elle Fanning (2017\u2013present)[50]\n* Amber Heard (2018\u2013present)[51]\n* Andie MacDowell (2018\u2013present)[52]\n* Duckie Thot (2018\u2013present)[53]\n* Jaha Dukureh (2018\u2013present)[3][7]\n* C\u00e9line Dion (2019\u2013present)[54]\n* Cindy Bruna (2020\u2013present)[55]\n* Katherine Langford (2020\u2013present)[56]\n* Viola Davis (2021\u2013present)[57]\n* Kate Winslet (2021\u2013present)[58]\n* Yseult (2021\u2013present)[59][60]\n* H.E.R.

The **Laboratoires Inn\u00e9ov** is a joint venture in nutritional cosmetics between L'Or\u00e9al and Nestl\u00e9; they draw on Nestl\u00e9's knowledge in the fields of nutrition and food safety.\n\n\n\n### Corporate social responsibility[edit]\n\n\n#### Group-wide sustainability plan[edit]\n\n\nIn 2013, L'Or\u00e9al announced a new sustainability plan it called \"Sharing Beauty With All\", committing to reduce the environmental impact of all products. According to *Marketing Week*, L'Or\u00e9al's pledges included \"aiming for 100 per cent of its products to have an environmental or social benefit; reducing the company's environmental footprint by 60 per cent; empowering \u201cevery L\u2019Or\u00e9al consumer to make sustainable consumption choices while enhancing the beauty of the planet\u201d; and giving L\u2019Or\u00e9al employees access to healthcare, social protection and training wherever they are in the world.\"[85]\n\n\nIn 2021, L'Or\u00e9al launches a new sustainability plan \"L'Or\u00e9al for the future\"[86] which contains a series of goals to achieve within 2030 on topics such as biodiversity, resource management, climate change and circularity.\n\n\n\n#### Sustainable development[edit]\n\n\nIn 2009, L'Or\u00e9al declared their intention to cut greenhouse gas emissions, water consumption, and waste by 50% over the period 2005-2015[87] \u2013 a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions that is to be in part achieved by the use of solar panels, biogas and electricity and hot water produced from the combustion of methane gas recovered from agricultural waste.[88] In 2012, the company declared a 37.1% reduction in CO2 emissions, a 24% reduction in water consumption and a 22% deduction in transportable waste, and was named a sector leader by Climate Counts for its practices and achievements in the management of carbon emissions.[89]\nIn 2014, L'Or\u00e9al made the commitment to ensure that none of its products were linked to deforestation, and to source 100% renewable raw materials by 2020.[90] The group was included in the Corporate Knights \"Global 100\" list of the 100 most sustainable companies.[90] In March 2023, L'Or\u00e9al announced its investment in Genomatica (Geno), a biotechnology company, to develop and manufacture 'biotechnology-based alternatives' to critical constituents in the formulation of 'cosmetic, personal care and cleaning products'.[91][92]\n\n\n\n#### Position on animal testing[edit]\n\n\nSince the 1980s, L'Or\u00e9al has invested \u20ac900 million in researching alternatives to animal testing for product safety, using methods such as reconstructed skin models, such as the Episkin model[93] at their research centres in Gerland, France, and Pudong, China.[94]\n\n\nNevertheless, this is complicated by markets such as China,[95] where it is difficult to sell a beauty product without animal testing.[96] Cosmetics by brands such as The Body Shop, which refuse to do animal testing, are thus not sold in China.\n\n\nIn 2013, L'Or\u00e9al was part of a consortium calling on the EU to invest more in research on alternatives to animal testing.[97]\n\n\n\n#### Promoting new methods for plastic recycling[edit]\n\n\nIn 2020, L'Oreal announced a cooperation with French biochemistry pioneer Carbios, aiming to establish a method of dissolving plastic waste by using enzymes.[98][99]\n\n\n\n#### Ukraine war[edit]\n\n\nIn 2022, L\u2019Or\u00e9al Paris donated \u20ac1 million ($1.09 million) to charities supporting refugees from the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.[100][101] L\u2019Or\u00e9al Paris also suspended all commercial activity in Russia, both retail and wholesale.[102][100] The company also supplies hygiene products to hospitals, maternity homes, centers with forcibly displaced persons, homes for the elderly, the military, etc.[103] L\u2019Or\u00e9al Paris financially support employees in Ukraine, guaranteeing the payment of wages and providing additional financial assistance, and provide accommodation for employees who are abroad and assist with temporary employment in other L'Or\u00e9al branches.[104]\n\n\n\n### Community involvement and awards[edit]\n\n\nIn 2014, L'Oreal was listed 61st among 1200 of India's most trusted brands according to the Brand Trust Report 2014, a study conducted by Trust Research Advisory, a brand analytics company.[105]\n\n\nIn 2008, L'Or\u00e9al was named Europe's top business employer by the European Student Barometer,[106] a survey conducted by Trendence that covers 20 European countries and incorporates the responses of over 91,000 students.\n\n\nThe L'Or\u00e9al-UNESCO Awards for Women in Science was established to improve the position of women in science by recognizing outstanding women researchers who have contributed to scientific progress.\n\n\nThe awards are a result of a partnership between the French cosmetics company L'Or\u00e9al and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and carry a grant of US$100,000 for each laureate.\n\n\nThe same partnership awards the UNESCO-L'Or\u00e9al International Fellowships, providing up to US$40,000 in funding over two years to fifteen young women scientists engaged in exemplary and promising research projects.[107]\n\n\nL'Or\u00e9al organises the yearly L'Or\u00e9al Brandstorm, a business game for students in 46 countries. The game is related to marketing and has a first prize of $10,000, the second prize of $5,000 and the third prize of $2500.\n\n\nL'Or\u00e9al is also a founding member of the \"Look Good\u00a0... Feel Better\" project, a charity which was formed over 16 years ago to help women combat the visible side effects of cancer treatment.\n\n\nL'Or\u00e9al also holds a global competition known as \"L'Or\u00e9al Brandstorm\" each year to invite students from around the world to be creative, innovative, and build their own business plans based around different topics (for example: Brandstorm 2019 was about sustainability).\n\n\nIn 2015, Standard Ethics Aei gave a rating to L'Oreal in order to include it in its Standard Ethics French Index.[108]\n\n\n\n## Research and innovation[edit]\n\n\n### Episkin[edit]\n\n\nEpiskin is a reconstructed skin model developed by engineers at L'Or\u00e9al France to provide an alternative to animal testing.[109] Human skin cells leftover from breast surgery[109] are developed under in vitro laboratory conditions to form sheets of reconstructed skin.[110] This has advantages over animal testing other than the sparing of animals: it can be adapted to create reconstructions of a range of skin colors, as well as younger and older skin, meaning that safety tests give more relevant results for humans.[110]\nIn 2006, the Episkin division acquired SkinEthic, a leading tissue engineering company.[111]\n\n\nThe aim for L'Or\u00e9al is to produce products that cater to their diverse customers specifically, in the emerging markets that currently account for 53% of the entire global beauty market.[112] Through these research methods L'Or\u00e9al aims to tap into one billion new consumers[112] in these markets for the upcoming years.\n\n\nIn 2003, the L'Or\u00e9al Institute for Ethnic Hair & Skin Research was inaugurated in Chicago to continue their research on African American hair and skin among other ethnicities.[113] The L'Or\u00e9al Group opened *the Predictive Evaluation Center* in Lyon, France in 2011. This center is devoted to evaluating the quality of the products without testing on animals.[114] Additionally, L'Or\u00e9al built an international \"Consumer Insights\" division as well as, regional Research and Innovation centres in six countries: Japan, China, India, the United States, Brazil, and France.[115] The aim of these centres is to collect information on their diverse consumers in order to develop products according to their various needs. In 2011, L'Or\u00e9al announced its intention to build a *Research and Innovation Center* in Bom Jesus Island Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Estimated at 30 million euros (70 million reais), this project is expected to create about 150 jobs by 2015.[116]\n\n\nThe L'Oreal Global Hair Research Centre, a facility in Paris Saint-Ouen, opened in March 2012. It serves as the headquarters for the international departments of hair color, hair care, and hairstyling. One of the largest investments in company R&I history, the 25,000m\u00b2 Centre hosts 500 employees. These include chemists, physical-chemists, opticians, materials scientists, metrologists, rheologists, computer scientists, and statisticians. The facility offers automation, modelling, and sensory evaluation.[117]\n\n\n\n### Human skin 3D printing[edit]\n\n\nL'Oreal announced in May 2015 that it was partnering with bioprinting startup Organovo to figure out how to 3D print living, breathing derma that can be used to test products for toxicity and efficacy. \"We're the first beauty company that Organovo has worked with\", said Guive Balooch, global vice president of L'Oreal's tech incubator.[118]\n\n\n\n### Modiface[edit]\n\n\nOn 16 March 2018, L'Or\u00e9al announced that it had acquired Modiface, a beauty tech company that uses augmented reality to allow users to digitally try on different makeup products and hairstyles.[119] Later in 2020, L'Or\u00e9al Paris introduced their first line of virtual makeup for social media platforms called \"Signature Faces\", an augmented reality filter for Instagram, Snapchat, Snap Camera, and Google Duo. It was in part marketed as a way to engage consumers spending more time online due to the pandemic, as well as a way for consumers to try on makeup at home for online shopping.[120]\n\n\n\n### Perso[edit]\n\n\nThis smart device creates custom formulas for lipstick, foundation, and skin care.[121] Customers can use it through the Perso app, which uses AI technology, and is expected to get launched in 2021.[122]\n\n\n\n### Hapta[edit]\n\n\nAt CES 2023, L'Or\u00e9al introduced its newly developed innovation, Hapta.[123][124] This product, Hapta, consists of a 'computerized makeup applicator' which is devoted to people with limited hand and arm mobility.[123] Indeed, it facilitates for them the process of applying lipstick.[125] This new applicator would able to 'mimic' different movements of a beauty routine through 'customizable accessories'.[126] The motive behind this innovation is to meet the beauty needs of people with limited hand and arm mobility.[123] According to L'Or\u00e9al, Hapta is expected to be launched by Lanc\u00f4me in 2023.[126]\n\n\n\n### L'Or\u00e9al brow magic[edit]\n\n\nAnother innovation by L'Or\u00e9al was announced at CES 2023 which is L'Oreal Brow Magic.[123] This innovation is considered to be the 'first at-home' electronic applicator to facilitate eyebrow-makeup.[123] In fact, it offers its users with immediate special and 'bespoke' brows.[123]\n\n\n\n## Controversy[edit]\n\n\n### Involvement in conflicts[edit]\n\n\nEug\u00e8ne Schueller, the company's founder, was accused of being a Nazi sympathizer.[127] L'Or\u00e9al concedes that Schueller was an antisemitic fascist.[128] He was also a member of La Cagoule, which supported the Vichy regime, and was a violent, pro-fascist and anti-communist organisation. Eug\u00e8ne bankrolled La Cagoule and some meetings of La Cagoule were held at L'Or\u00e9al headquarters. Some of the criminal activities perpetrated by La Cagoule include firearms transportation, assassinating a former minister, and firebombing six synagogues.[129][130]\n\n\nOther controversy arose when Jean Frydman, a shareholder and board member of Paravision, a film subsidiary of L'Or\u00e9al, was fired. He claims that he was let go because L'Or\u00e9al wanted to avoid an Arab boycott of businesses associated with Jews. In turn, Frydman decided to expose the past of L'Or\u00e9al executives. Andr\u00e9 Bettencourt who married Schueller's daughter, Liliane Bettencourt, and became deputy chairman for L'Or\u00e9al, wrote 60 articles for La Terre Fran\u00e7aise. La Terre Fran\u00e7aise was an antisemitic Nazi propaganda sheet. Andr\u00e9 has admitted ownership of the propaganda but claimed he was poisoned by the Vichy regime and said, \"I have repeatedly expressed my regrets concerning them in public and will always beg the Jewish community to forgive me for them.\"[129] Andr\u00e9 Bettencourt also sheltered Schueller and several collaborators from the French Resistance after Liberation.[130] It was also revealed that Eug\u00e8ne Schueller hired Jacques Correze, who was the honorary head of L'Or\u00e9al's U.S. affiliate, Cosmair, and was involved with La Cagoule.[128]\n\n\nFurther controversy arose when it was revealed that L'Or\u00e9al had its German headquarters for over 30 years, before being sold in 1991, on land confiscated from a Jewish family during World War II. The Jewish family has been battling for restitution from the company for three generations, the latest of which is Edith Rosenfelder, a Holocaust survivor. Fritz Rosenfelder was forced to sell the house to a Nazi official, of which the family never received the proceeds of the sale. Instead, the family was deported. The Allies passed Jewish restitution legislation which states that transactions with Nazis, even if appearing to be with the owner's consent, can be considered invalid. As the land was sold to an offshoot of L'Or\u00e9al, which was later bought out in 1961 by L'Or\u00e9al, the company claims that it is not responsible for anything that happened before then. The basis for Rosenfelder's argument is that since the original sale was illegal, all subsequent sales are equally unlawful. There was restitution paid in 1951 to the Jewish Restitution Successor Organization, though this was done without the family's consent and none of the money ever reached the family. A book by Monica Waitzfelder, daughter of Edith Rosenfelder, published in French as *L'Or\u00e9al a pris ma maison* and in English as *L'Or\u00e9al stole my house!*, details how L'Or\u00e9al took over the Waitzfelder home in the German city of Karlsruhe (after the Nazis had engineered the removal of the family) to make it its German headquarters.[131] Monica Waitzfelder is quoted as saying, \"All the other businesses which took Jewish property have since returned it, without any great debate. I don't understand why L'Or\u00e9al should be any different from the others.\" A case was brought before the Supreme Court in France, but the public prosecutor ruled that there could be no trial. As of 2007, she is bringing the case to the European Court of Human Rights.[130][131]\n\n\nOn 31 July 2014 during Operation Protective Edge launched by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in the Gaza Strip, the Israel advocacy organisation StandWithUs posted several Facebook photos of care packages, which they said were donated by Garnier Israel to female IDF soldiers.[132][133][134] This sparked several calls to boycott Garnier and L'Or\u00e9al worldwide.[135] As of 13 June 2024 no official statement was made by Garnier or L'Or\u00e9al regarding the donation.\n\n\nOn March 4, 2022, L'Or\u00e9al announced \u20ac1 million donation for relief support of Ukrainians who suffer from the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.[136]\n\n\n\n### Animal testing[edit]\n\n\nL'Or\u00e9al began *in vitro* tissue testing in 1979, and does not test any of its products or ingredients on animals anywhere in the world since 1989\u201314 years before it was required by regulation.[137] Controversy came from the fact that L'Or\u00e9al sells products in China, whose regulators conduct animal testing on cosmetics to be sold within its territory. Even though a ban on animal testing in China came into effect in January 2020, Chinese authorities still perform this practice for imported \"ordinary\" cosmetics.[138][139]\n\n\nFollowing L'Or\u00e9al's 2006 purchase of The Body Shop, which does not support animal testing, The Body Shop's founder Anita Roddick was forced to defend herself against allegations of \"abandoning her principles\" over L'Or\u00e9al's involvement on animal testing. Calls were made for shoppers to boycott The Body Shop.[140] L'Or\u00e9al sold The Body Shop to Brazilian group Natura Cosm\u00e9ticos in 2017.[141]\n\n\n\n### Discrimination[edit]\n\n\nOn 11 August 2005, the Supreme Court of California ruled that former L'Or\u00e9al sales manager Elyse Yanowitz had adequately pleaded a cause of action for retaliatory termination under the California Fair Employment and Housing Act, and remanded the case for trial.[142] The case arose out of a 1997 incident in which Jack Wiswall, then the general manager for designer fragrances, allegedly told Yanowitz to fire a dark-skinned sales associate despite the associate's good performance. When Yanowitz refused, Wiswall pointed to a \"sexy\" blonde-haired woman and said, \"God damn it, get me one that looks like that.\" Wiswall retired as president of the luxury products division of L'Or\u00e9al USA at the end of 2006.[142]\n\n\nThe company has recently faced discrimination lawsuits in France related to the hiring of spokesmodels and institutional racism. In July 2007, the Garnier division and an external employment agency were fined \u20ac30,000 for recruitment practices that intentionally excluded non-white women from promoting its hair wash, \"Fructis Style\".[143] L'Or\u00e9al is reported as saying the decision was \"incomprehensible\",[144] and would challenge the measure in court.\n\n\nL'Or\u00e9al continues to sell skin whitening products, which have been criticized as \"capitalising on women's insecurities due to colourism.\" They advertise these controversial products, which have been criticised for promoting a colonial attitude as well as having safety concerns,[145] on their website by claiming; \"Achieve clear, translucent and radiant skin. Our skin whitening products work to fade dark spots and brighten skin to give you the fair, flawless complexion you desire.\"[146]\n\n\n\n### False advertising[edit]\n\n\nIn May 2007, L'Or\u00e9al was one of several cosmetic manufacturers (along with Clinique, Estee Lauder, Payot, Lanc\u00f4me)[147] ordered by the Therapeutic Goods Administration in Australia to withdraw advertising regarding the wrinkle removal capabilities of their products.[148]\n\n\nIn the UK, L'Or\u00e9al has faced criticism from OFCOM regarding the truth of their advertising and marketing campaigns concerning the product performance of one of their mascara brands. In July 2007, the British Advertising Standards Authority attacked L'Or\u00e9al for a television advert on its \"Telescopic\" mascara, featuring Pen\u00e9lope Cruz, stating, \"it will make your eyelashes 60% longer.\" In fact, it only made the lashes look 60% bigger, by separating and thickening at the roots and by thickening the tips of the lashes. They also failed to state that the model was wearing false eyelashes.[149]\n\n\nIn July 2011, the British Advertising Standards Authority took action against L'Or\u00e9al, banning two airbrushed Lanc\u00f4me advertisements in the UK featuring actress Julia Roberts and supermodel Christy Turlington. The agency issued the ban after British politician Jo Swinson argued that the two ads misrepresented reality and added to the self-image problem amongst females in the UK. L'Or\u00e9al acknowledged that the photos had been airbrushed but argued that the two cosmetic products could actually produce the results depicted in the ads and that the results of the products had been scientifically proven.[150]\n\n\nIn June 2014, the company reached an agreement with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission not to make claims about its anti-aging products unless it had credible scientific evidence supporting the claims. The settlement followed an investigation by the commission into claims being made in relation to two products, which the commission described as \"false and unsubstantiated\".\n\n\nL'Or\u00e9al has a team of 400 members of staff who post content to Facebook every day, according to Marc Menesguen, the company's chief marketing officer.[151]\n\n\n\n### Patent lawsuit[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2017, the University of Massachusetts Medical filed a patent lawsuit against L'Or\u00e9al. In August 2017, Dennis Wyrzykowski and his company, Carmel Laboratories LLC, joined the lawsuit. The two parties claimed that L'Or\u00e9al's brands used UMass' patented technology for skin creams with the chemical adenosine.[152] In 2021, a judge found the patents invalid. In 2022, the U.S. Appeals Court reversed the decision, stating that UMass could continue to purse its lawsuit.[153]\n\n\n\n### Corporate misconduct[edit]\n\n\nL'Or\u00e9al was fined by Autorit\u00e9 de la concurrence in France in 2016 for price-fixing on personal hygiene products.[154]\n\n\n\n#### Munroe Bergdorf[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Munroe Bergdorf race row incident\n\nIn August 2017, L'Or\u00e9al dismissed Munroe Bergdorf, a mixed-race transgender model, after she responded to the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, by stating in a Facebook post: \"Honestly I don't have the energy to talk about the racial violence of white people any more. Yes ALL white people\"; the post was also quoted as saying that \"[white people's] existence, privilege and success as a race is built on the backs, blood and death of people of colour\", \"racism isn't learned, it's inherited and\u00a0... passed down through privilege\" and that \"white people\" ought to \"begin to admit that their race is the most violent and oppressive force of nature on Earth\".[155] Shortly after terminating Bergdorf, L'Or\u00e9al released a statement claiming their commitment to \"[support] diversity and tolerance towards all people irrespective of their race, background, gender and religion\" and had terminated their partnership with Bergdorf because her comments were \"at odds with those values\".[156][157]\n\n\n\n### Amber Heard[edit]\n\n\nIn 2018, L'Or\u00e9al Paris hired Amber Heard as a Global Ambassador, also giving a special tribute to her.[158][159] In 2020, after a tape leaked of Heard admitting to having hit her ex-husband Johnny Depp, several petitions were filed requesting L'Oreal to fire her.[160][161][162] As of June 2021, L'Oreal continued to include Heard among a team of \"ambassadors\" that also includes Kate Winslet, Jane Fonda, Elle Fanning, and French singer-songwriter Yseult.[163] Heard was being sued in a defamation trial by her ex-husband, Johnny Depp in which he accused her of domestic abuse. She was found to have defamed her ex-husband with malice on June 2, 2022, by a jury; Heard is currently appealing her case.[164]\n\n\n\n## Brand portfolio[edit]\n\n\n![](image)L'Or\u00e9al lipsticks\n![](image)L'Or\u00e9al skincare product\nBrands are generally categorized by their targeted markets, such as the mass, professional, luxury, and active cosmetics markets. The Body Shop and Galderma are directly attached to the head office. L'Or\u00e9al also owns interests in various activities such as fine chemicals, health, finance, design, advertising, and insurance.[165]\n\n\n\n### Consumer products division[edit]\n\n\n* 3ce[166]\n* Carol's Daughter\n* Colorama\n* Cr\u00e9ateurs de Beaut\u00e9\n* Essie\n* Garnier\n* L'Or\u00e9al Paris\n* Magic\n* Maybelline\n* Niely\n* NYX Cosmetics\n* SoftSheen-Carson\n\n### L'Or\u00e9al luxe division[edit]\n\n\n* Aesop\n* Atelier Cologne\n* Biotherm\n* Cacharel\n* Clarisonic (Discontinued September 30, 2020)[167]\n* Diesel\n* Giorgio Armani Beauty\n* Guy Laroche\n* Helena Rubinstein\n* House 99\n* IT Cosmetics\n* Kiehl's\n* Lanc\u00f4me\n* MUGLER\n* Paloma Picasso\n* Proenza Schouler\n* Ralph Lauren Fragrances\n* Shu Uemura\n* Urban Decay\n* Valentino Beauty\n* Viktor & Rolf\n* Yue Sai\n* Yves Saint Laurent Beaut\u00e9\n\n### Professional products division[edit]\n\n\n* L'Or\u00e9al Technique\n* L'Or\u00e9al Professionnel, including ARTec and Innate\n* K\u00e9rastase (created by L'Oreal in 1964)\n* K\u00e9raskin Esthetics, created by L'Oreal in 2007 and specialising in skin care professionals\n* Matrix Essentials, founded by Arnie Miller in 1980 and acquired by L'Oreal in 2000\n* Mizani, founded in 1991 and bought by L'Oreal in 2001\n* PureOlogy Research, founded in 2001 and acquired by L'Oreal in 2007\n* Redken 5th Avenue NYC, founded by Paula Kent and Jheri Redding in 1960 and acquired by L'Oreal in 1993\n* Shu Uemura Art of Hair\n* Carol's Daughter\n* Carita\n* Essie, founded in 1981 and acquired by L'Oreal in 2010[168]\n* Decl\u00e9or[169]\n* Botanicals Fresh Care\n* Cheryl's Cosmeceuticals[170]\n\n### Active cosmetics division[edit]\n\n\n* Vichy\n* La Roche-Posay\n* Skinceuticals\n* Roger&Gallet - sold in 2020\n* Sanoflore\n* Dermablend\n* AcneFree\n* Ambi\n* CeraVe\n* Logocos since 2018\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** \"Annual Results 2022\" (PDF).

It is the second largest cosmetics company in the world after L'Or\u00e9al. The company owns a diverse portfolio of brands, including La Mer, Jo Malone London, Clinique and Tom Ford Beauty, among many more, distributed internationally through both digital commerce and retail channels.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Founders Est\u00e9e and Joseph H. Lauder in 1971\nThe company began in 1946 when Est\u00e9e Lauder and her husband Joseph began producing cosmetics in New York City. They first carried only four products: Cleansing Oil, Skin Lotion, Super Rich All-purpose Creme, and Creme Pack.[3] Two years later, in 1948 they established their first department store account with Saks Fifth Avenue in Manhattan.\n\n\nOver the next 15 years, they expanded the range and continued to sell their products in the United States. In 1960, the company started its first international account in the London department store Harrods. The following year it opened an office in Hong Kong.\n\n\nIn 1964, they introduced Aramis, a line of fragrance and grooming products for men named after an exotic Turkish root originally used as an aphrodisiac.[4] In 1967, Est\u00e9e Lauder herself was named one of ten Outstanding Women in Business in the United States by business and financial editors.[5] This was followed by a Spirit of Achievement Award from Albert Einstein College of Medicine at Yeshiva University in 1968.[*citation needed*] In that year, the company expanded again, opening Clinique, a dermatologist-guided (Dr. Norman Orentreich), allergy-tested, fragrance-free cosmetic brand.\n\n\nEst\u00e9e Lauder's Clinique brand became the first women's cosmetic company to introduce a second line for men when, in 1976, they began a separate line called \"Skin Supplies for Men\", which continues to be sold at Clinique counters worldwide. In 1981, the company's products became available in the Soviet Union.\n\n\nIn the 1990s, brand acquisitions and licensing agreements contributed to explosive growth as the company transformed from a family-owned business to a publicly traded, family-controlled organization. The decade opened with the creation of Origins \u2013 the first wellness brand in U.S. department stores. The first licensing agreement for fragrances was with fashion designer Tommy Hilfiger in 1993, followed by Kiton,[6] an Italian fashion house (1995), and with American fashion designer Donna Karan (1997).[7]\n\n\nBrand acquisitions began with an investment in the Toronto-based MAC Cosmetics in 1994, which the company then acquired in 1998. Bobbi Brown Cosmetics, designed by the celebrated makeup artist, was acquired in 1995, as was La Mer \u2013 along with the original recipe for its supreme luxury product, Cr\u00e8me de la Mer, containing the nutrient-rich Miracle Broth. The company ventured into its first hair care and holistic beauty brand with Aveda in 1997. The fragrance house Jo Malone London was acquired in 1999.[7]\n\n\nOn November 16, 1995, the Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies went public on the New York Stock Exchange at $26.00 a share ($6.50 on a post-split basis).[8]\n\n\nAcquisitions and licensing continued in the 2000s as the Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies bought a majority interest in the hair salon Bumble and bumble and completed its acquisition in 2006; an exclusive global licensing agreement was signed with fashion designer Michael Kors (2003). Designer Tom Ford begins a project with the company and later an agreement was signed with him (2005) to develop and distribute fragrances and cosmetics under the Tom Ford Beauty brand.[7]\n\n\nOn July 1, 2010, the company acquired Smashbox Beauty Cosmetics, Inc., a brand created in Smashbox Studios in Culver City, California, by brothers Dean and Davis Factor (as in Max).[9]\n\n\n\n![](image)The large Est\u00e9e Lauder cosmetics counter at MYER Sydney City\n![](image)Small-medium-sized pre-2013 style counter at New Zealand retailer Farmers\nOn October 28, 2011, Aramis and Designer Fragrances, a division of the Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies Inc., and Tory Burch LLC announced the signing of a multiyear agreement for the exclusive worldwide license of the Tory Burch fragrance business. This partnership marked Tory Burch's first step into the beauty industry. The first Tory Burch fragrance products were introduced in 2013.[10]\n\n\nIn 2012, the company launched AERIN Beauty, a luxury lifestyle beauty and fragrance brand inspired by the signature style of its founder, Aerin Lauder.\n\n\nIn 2014, the company acquired two insider beauty brands, RODIN olio lusso, a skin care brand known for its \"Luxury Face Oil\", and Le Labo, a fragrance and sensory lifestyle brand. Later that year, the company also made its first investment in India by buying a minority stake in Forest Essentials, a luxury cosmetics company specializing in Ayurvedic products.[11] In 2015, the company acquired Editions de Parfums Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Malle, a fragrance brand, and GLAMGLOW, a Hollywood skin care brand.[12]\n\n\nIn 2016, the company acquired Becca Cosmetics, its first color cosmetic group acquisition since Smashbox in 2010.[13] In November 2016, the company made its largest acquisition to date by acquiring California-based cosmetics company Too Faced for US$1.45 billion.[14]\n\n\nIn 2019, the company acquired Dr. Jart+. Founded in Korea in 2004, Dr. Jart+ pioneered the invention of BB Cream, setting the standard for multifunctional beauty.[15]\n\n\nIn 2021, the company acquired Canadian-based Deciem Beauty Group Inc.[16] In 2022, Est\u00e9e Lauder opened a 300,000 sq ft. distribution center in Galgenen, Switzerland.[17]\n\n\nIn November 2022, the company announced it was to acquire the designer fashion house Tom Ford in a deal worth $2.8bn, with Ford remaining as creative director until at least 2023.[18]\n\n\n\n### Response to the COVID-19 pandemic[edit]\n\n\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic the Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies announced on August 20, 2020, a reduction in their workforce by 1,500 to 2,000 personnel worldwide, or about 3 percent of total employees. Most of the reductions will be support workers and store employees. The company also announce they would be closing approximately 10 to 15 percent of their stores, close in-store beauty counters, and focus more on digital operations.[19]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\nThe Est\u00e9e Lauder company has many brands and Est\u00e9e Lauder is one of the brands. It has had sometimes high-profile spokesmodels, sometimes referred to simply as 'faces'. Past 'faces' for Est\u00e9e Lauder include Karen Graham, Bruce Boxleitner, Shaun Casey, Willow Bay, Paulina Porizkova, Elizabeth Hurley, Carolyn Murphy, supermodel Liya Kebede \u2013 the first African 'face' of Estee Lauder, Anja Rubik, and actress Gwyneth Paltrow. As of 2008[update] the main spokesmodel for Est\u00e9e Lauder was supermodel Hilary Rhoda. In 2010, the company added three more faces to the roster, Chinese model Liu Wen, Puerto Rican model Joan Smalls, and French model Constance Jablonski.[20]\n\n\nIn 2015, Est\u00e9e Lauder signed model Kendall Jenner to promote the brand.[21]\n\n\nIn 2017, the company announced Violette Serrat as their Global Beauty Director.[22]\n\n\nAlvin Chereskin, the founder of AC&R, was the long-time creative partner of the company.[23]\n\n\n\n## Operations and finances[edit]\n\n\n### Finances[edit]\n\n\nFor fiscal year 2016, the Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies achieved net sales of $11.26 billion, a 4% increase compared with $10.78 billion in the prior year. Net earnings for the year were $1.11 billion, a 2% increase compared with $1.09 billion in the previous year, and diluted net earnings per common share rose 5% to $2.96, compared with $2.82 reported in the prior year.[24] As of 2018, Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies ranked 258 on the Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by revenue.[25]\n\n\n\n### Executive management[edit]\n\n\nLeonard A. Lauder is chairman emeritus. William P. Lauder is executive chairman. Fabrizio Freda is president and chief executive officer.[26]\n\n\n\n## Breast Cancer Awareness campaign[edit]\n\n\nIn October 1992, the Breast Cancer Awareness campaign was launched by Evelyn Lauder (Est\u00e9e's daughter-in-law) who co-created the \"Pink Ribbon\"[27] with *Self* magazine as a symbol of breast health. Since then, millions of people globally have heard the message about the importance of breast health and early detection can save lives.\nThe Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies' annual Breast Cancer Awareness campaign involves all of the 19 brands that make up the Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies. They collectively represent The Breast Cancer Research Foundation's first and largest corporate supporter.\n\n\nSince 1992, the Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies' Breast Cancer campaign has raised more than $89 Million globally for lifesaving research, education, and medical services.[28]\n\n\n\n## Environmental activism[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2022, Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies pledged \u00a3100,000 ($115,453) to investigate water quality in Windermere, the largest lake in England. The company has also pledged \u00a3500,000 ($577,222) over the next five years that will be used to fund the pioneering nature restoration projects that will be carried out across multiple UK National Parks.[29]\n\n\n\n## Brands[edit]\n\n\nThe Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies brands include:[30]\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Cosmetics*** AERIN Beauty\n* Bobbi Brown\n* Clinique\n* DECIEM by Brandon Truaxe\n* Dr. Jart+\n* Est\u00e9e Lauder\n* GLAMGLOW\n* La Mer\n* Lab Series\n* MAC Cosmetics\n* Origins\n* Darphin Paris\n* Smashbox\n* Too Faced[31]\n* Tom Ford Beauty\n | **Fragrance*** Aramis\n* Kilian Paris\n* Editions de Parfums Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Malle\n* Jo Malone London\n* Lauder (Fragrances)\n* Le Labo\n\n**Haircare**\n* Aveda\n* Bumble and bumble\n\n\n |\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This article's \"criticism\" or \"controversy\" section **may compromise the article's neutrality**. Please help rewrite or integrate negative information to other sections through discussion on the talk page. *(March 2021)*\n |\n\n\n### SOPA[edit]\n\n\nEst\u00e9e Lauder Companies appeared on lists of major companies supporting SOPA, the controversial, but unsuccessful, Congressional anti-piracy bill that was considered overreaching by critics.[32][33]\n\n\n\n### Child labor[edit]\n\n\nIn 2001, it was reported that children were discovered working in a factory in Cambridge, New York, making products for Origins, one of Estee Lauder's natural products brands. The contracted company was Common Sense Natural Soap & Bodycare, owned by a group led by cult leader Yoneq Gene Spriggs. Estee Lauder said it immediately moved to terminate the contract with the manufacturer it had been in business with for 5 years, stating it was totally unaware prior to the initial inspection.[34]\n\n\n\n### Animal testing[edit]\n\n\nThe Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies perform non-animal and human volunteer testing to assess product safety and efficacy. Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies product goes through animal testing where required by law by its country government. The Chinese government requires testing on animals for many cosmetic products.[35] This causes controversy for smaller brands that are \"cruelty free\" but were acquired by Est\u00e9e Lauder.[36]\n\n\n\n### Boycott and anti-boycott[edit]\n\n\n![](image)QUIT activists protesting Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies, 2004.\nSince at least February 2001, Est\u00e9e Lauder and its brands have been the target of a boycott campaign led by pro-Palestine activists who have targeted the corporation because of the pro-Israel activities of Ronald Lauder.[37][38] In June 2003, the San Francisco-based Queers Undermining Israeli Terrorism (QUIT) took up the boycott with their \"Est\u00e9e Slaughter\" campaign.[39] The boycott has generated an anti-boycott campaign by supporters of Israel.[40]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** \"The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies Inc. 2022 Annual Form 10-K Report\" (PDF). *elcompanies.com*.

Before the sale of Pringles to Kellogg's, its product portfolio also included food, snacks, and beverages.[3] P&G is incorporated in Ohio.[4]\n\n\nIn 2014, P&G recorded $83.1\u00a0billion in sales. On August 1, 2014, P&G announced it was streamlining the company, dropping and selling off around 100 brands from its product portfolio in order to focus on the remaining 65 brands,[5] which produced 95% of the company's profits. A.G. Lafley, the company's chairman and CEO until October 2015, said the future P&G would be \"a much simpler, much less complex company of leading brands that's easier to manage and operate\".[6]\n\n\nJon Moeller is the current president and CEO of P&G.[7]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Origins[edit]\n\n\nCandlemaker William Procter, born in England, and soap maker James Gamble, born in Ireland, both emigrated to the US from the United Kingdom. They initially settled in Cincinnati, Ohio, and met when they married sisters Olivia and Elizabeth Norris.[8] Alexander Norris, their father-in-law, persuaded them to become business partners, and in 1837, Procter & Gamble was created.\n\n\nFrom 1858 to 1859, sales reached $1\u00a0million. By that point, about 80 employees worked for Procter & Gamble. During the American Civil War, the company won contracts to supply the Union Army with soap and candles. In addition to the increased profits experienced during the war, the military contracts introduced soldiers from all over the country to Procter & Gamble's products.\n\n\nIn the 1880s, Procter & Gamble began to market a new product, an inexpensive soap that floated in water.[9] The company called the soap Ivory.[9] William Arnett Procter, William Procter's grandson, began a profit-sharing program for the company's workforce in 1887. By giving the workers a stake in the company, he correctly assumed that they would be less likely to go on strike.\n\n\nThe company began to build factories in other locations in the United States because the demand for products had outgrown the capacity of the Cincinnati facilities. The company's leaders began to diversify its products as well, and in 1911 the company began producing Crisco, a shortening made of vegetable oils rather than animal fats.[9]\n\n\nBeginning in the 1880s, P&G advertised its wares in full-page advertisements in many general-interest magazines. By 1921, it had become a major international corporation with a diversified line of soaps, toiletries, and food products; in that year, its annual advertising budget reached $1 million. \nIn the 1920s, P&G advertised its products on the new medium of radio and, from 1932 forward, was one of the biggest sponsors of daytime serials, which soon acquired the nickname of *soap operas*.[10] In the television era, P&G sponsored and produced some twenty soap operas across six decades before the last of its shows ended in 2010.[11]\n\n\n\n### International expansion[edit]\n\n\nThe company moved into other countries, both in terms of manufacturing and product sales, becoming an international corporation with its 1930 acquisition of the Thomas Hedley Co.,[9] based in Newcastle upon Tyne, England. After this acquisition, Procter & Gamble had their UK Headquarters at 'Hedley House' in Newcastle upon Tyne, until quite recently, when they moved to The Heights, Brooklands. Numerous new products and brand names were introduced over time, and Procter & Gamble began branching out into new areas. The company introduced Tide laundry detergent in 1946[12] and Prell shampoo in 1947.[13] In 1955, Procter & Gamble began selling the first toothpaste to contain fluoride, known as Crest.[9] Branching out once again in 1957, the company purchased Charmin paper mills and began manufacturing toilet paper and other tissue paper products. Once again focusing on laundry, Procter & Gamble began making Downy fabric softener in 1960 and Bounce fabric softener sheets in 1972.[14] From 1957 to 1968, Procter & Gamble owned Clorox, the leading American manufacturer of liquid bleach; however, the Federal Trade Commission challenged the acquisition, and the U.S. Supreme Court decided against P&G in April 1967.[15]\n\n\nOne of the most revolutionary products to come out on the market was the company's disposable Pampers diaper, first test-marketed in 1961, the same year Procter & Gamble came out with Head & Shoulders.[16] Prior to this point, disposable diapers were not popular, although Johnson & Johnson had developed a product called Chux. Babies always wore cloth diapers, which were leaky and labor-intensive to wash. Pampers provided a convenient alternative, albeit at the environmental cost of more waste requiring landfilling. Amid the recent concerns parents have voiced on the ingredients in diapers, Pampers launched Pampers Pure collection in 2018, which is a \"natural\" diaper alternative.[17]\n\n\n\n### Further developments[edit]\n\n\nProcter & Gamble acquired a number of other companies that diversified its product line and significantly increased profits. These acquisitions included Folgers Coffee, Norwich Eaton Pharmaceuticals (the makers of Pepto-Bismol), Richardson-Vicks, Noxell (Noxzema), Shulton's Old Spice, Max Factor, the Iams Company, and Pantene, among others. In 1994, the company made headlines for big losses resulting from leveraged positions in interest rate derivatives, and subsequently sued Bankers Trust for fraud; this placed their management in the unusual position of testifying in court that they had entered into transactions that they were not capable of understanding. In 1996, P&G again made headlines when the Food and Drug Administration approved a new product developed by the company, Olestra. Also known by its brand name 'Olean', Olestra is a lower-calorie substitute for fat in cooking potato chips and other snacks.\n\n\nIn January 2005, P&G announced the acquisition of Gillette, forming the largest consumer goods company and placing Unilever into second place.[18] This added brands such as Gillette razors, Duracell, Braun, and Oral-B to their stable. The acquisition was approved by the European Union and the Federal Trade Commission, with conditions to a spinoff of certain overlapping brands. P&G agreed to sell its SpinBrush battery-operated electric toothbrush business to Church & Dwight,[19] and Gillette's Rembrandt toothpaste line to Johnson & Johnson.[20] The deodorant brands Right Guard, Soft and Dri, and Dry Idea were sold to Dial Corporation.[21] In 2001, Liquid Paper and Gillette's stationery division, Paper Mate, were sold to Newell Rubbermaid. The companies officially merged on October 1, 2005. In 2008, P&G branched into the record business with its sponsorship of Tag Records, as an endorsement for TAG Body Spray.[22]\n\n\nP&G's dominance in many categories of consumer products makes its brand management decisions worthy of study.[*according to whom?*][23] For example, P&G's corporate strategists must account for the likelihood of one of their products cannibalizing the sales of another.[24]\n\n\nOn August 25, 2009, the Ireland-based pharmaceutical company Warner Chilcott announced they had bought P&G's prescription-drug business for $3.1\u00a0billion.[25]\n\n\nP&G exited the food business in 2012 when it sold its Pringles snack food business to Kellogg's for $2.75\u00a0billion after the $2.35\u00a0billion deal with former suitor Diamond Foods fell short.[26] The company had previously sold Jif peanut butter, Crisco shortening and oils, and Folgers coffee in separate transactions to fellow Ohio-based company Smucker's.\n\n\nIn April 2014, the company sold its Iams pet food business in all markets excluding Europe to Mars, Inc. for $2.9\u00a0billion.[27] It sold the European Iams business to Spectrum Brands in December 2014.[28]\n\n\n\n### Restructuring[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2014, P&G announced it was streamlining the company, dropping around 100 brands and concentrating on the remaining 65, which were producing 95% of the company's profits.[5]\n\n\nIn March 2015, the company divested its Vicks VapoSteam U.S. liquid inhalant business to Helen of Troy, part of a brand-restructuring operation. This deal was the first health-related divestiture under the brand-restructuring operation. The deal included a fully paid-up license to the Vicks VapoSteam trademarks and the U.S. license of P&G's Vicks VapoPad trademarks for scent pads. Most Vicks VapoSteam and VapoPads are used in Vicks humidifiers, vaporizers and other health care devices already marketed by Helen of Troy.[29]\n\n\nLater that same year in July, the company announced the sale of 43 of its beauty brands to Coty, a beauty-product manufacturer, in a US$13\u00a0billion deal. It cited sluggish growth of its beauty division as the reason for the divestiture.[30][31][32] The sale was completed on October 3, 2016.[33]\n\n\nIn February 2016, P&G completed the transfer of Duracell to Berkshire Hathaway through an exchange of shares.[34]\n\n\nIn December 2018, Procter & Gamble completed the acquisition of the consumer health division of Merck Group (known as EMD Serono in North America) for \u20ac3.4 billion ($4.2 billion) and renamed it as Procter & Gamble Health Limited in May 2019.[35][36]\n\n\nIn November 2018, P&G unveiled a simpler corporate structure with six business units that will be effective from July 2019.[37]\n\n\n\n## Finances[edit]\n\n\nFor the fiscal year 2018, Procter & Gamble reported earnings of US$9.750 billion, with an annual revenue of US$66.832 billion, an increase of 2.7% over the previous fiscal cycle. Procter & Gamble's Shares traded at over $86 per share in 2017, and its market capitalization was valued at over US$221.5 billion in October 2018.[38] Procter & Gamble ranked No. 42 on the 2018 Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by total revenue.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Revenuein million USD$\n | Net incomein million USD$\n | Total assetsin millions USD$\n | Employees\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2005\n | 56,741\n | 6,923\n | 61,527\n |  |\n| 2006\n | 68,222\n | 8,684\n | 135,695\n |  |\n| 2007\n | 74,832\n | 10,340\n | 138,014\n |  |\n| 2008\n | 79,257\n | 12,075\n | 143,992\n |  |\n| 2009\n | 76,694\n | 13,436\n | 134,833\n | 135,000\n |\n| 2010\n | 78,938\n | 12,517\n | 128,172\n | 127,000\n |\n| 2011\n | 82,559\n | 11,564\n | 138,354\n | 129,000\n |\n| 2012\n | 83,680\n | 10,500\n | 132,244\n | 126,000\n |\n| 2013\n | 84,167\n | 11,068\n | 139,263\n | 121,000\n |\n| 2014\n | 83,062\n | 11,390\n | 144,266\n | 118,000\n |\n| 2015\n | 76,279\n | 6,777\n | 129,495\n | 110,000\n |\n| 2016\n | 65,299\n | 10,508\n | 127,136\n | 105,000\n |\n| 2017\n | 65,058\n | 15,326\n | 120,406\n | 95,000\n |\n| 2018\n | 66,832\n | 9,750\n | 118,310\n | 92,000\n |\n| 2019\n | 67,684\n | 3,897\n | 115,095\n | 97,000\n |\n| 2020\n | 70,950\n | 12,764\n | 120,700\n | 99,000\n |\n| 2021\n | 76,118\n | 14,035\n | 119,307\n | 101,000\n |\n| 2022\n | 81,286\n | 15,306\n | 117,914\n | 103,000\n |\n| 2023\n | 82,006\n | 14,653\n | 120,829\n | 107,000\n |\n\n\n## Carbon footprint[edit]\n\n\nProcter & Gamble reported Total CO2e emissions (Scope 1 and Scope 2) for the twelve months ending December 31, 2020, at 2,619 Kt (-1,441 /-35.5% y-o-y).[39] In September 2021, P&G set a new ambition to achieve net zero emissions across its operations and supply chain by 2040.[40]\n\n\n\n\n\nProcter & Gamble's annual Total CO2e Emissions - Market-Based Scope 1 + Scope 2 (in kilotonnes)\n| Dec 2015 | Dec 2016 | Dec 2017 | Dec 2018 | Dec 2019 | Dec 2020\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 5,149[41] | 4,669[42] | 4,559[43] | 4,081[44] | 4,060[45] | 2,619[39] |\n\n\n## Operations[edit]\n\n\nAs of July\u00a01, 2016[update], the company structure has been categorized into ten categories and six selling and market organizations.\n\n\n\n* Categories\n\n\n* + Baby Care\n\t+ Fabric Care\n\t+ Family Care\n\t+ Feminine Care\n\t+ Grooming\n\t+ Hair Care\n\t+ Home Care\n\t+ Oral Care\n\t+ Personal Health Care\n\t+ Skin and Personal Care\n* Selling and Market Organizations\n\t+ Asia Pacific, India, the Middle East and Africa (AMA)\n\t+ Europe\n\t+ Greater China\n\t+ Latin America\n\t+ North America\n\n### Management and staff[edit]\n\n\n**Board of Directors**\n\n\nThe board of directors of Procter & Gamble currently has 12 members.[46]\n\n\n\n* B.

The division includes Downy, Gain, Tide, Febreze, and Dawn.[63]\n\n\nAccording to *Advertising Age*, Procter & Gamble spent $4.3\u00a0billion advertising their various brands in the United States in 2015, making it the top advertiser in the country.[64]\n\n\nManufacturing operations are based in these countries:\n\n\n\n* ![](image)\u00a0United States\n* ![](image)\u00a0Canada\n* ![](image)\u00a0Mexico\n* ![](image)\u00a0Philippines\n* ![](image)\u00a0Hungary\n* ![](image)\u00a0Argentina\n* ![](image)\u00a0Vietnam\n* ![](image)\u00a0Indonesia\n* ![](image)\u00a0Ireland\n* ![](image)\u00a0Romania\n* ![](image)\u00a0United Kingdom\n* ![](image)\u00a0France\n* ![](image)\u00a0Germany\n* ![](image)\u00a0Poland[65]\n* ![](image)\u00a0Czech Republic[66]\n* ![](image)\u00a0Russia[67]\n* ![](image)\u00a0Saudi Arabia\n* ![](image)\u00a0United Arab Emirates\n* ![](image)\u00a0Australia\n* ![](image)\u00a0New Zealand\n* ![](image)\u00a0Brazil\n* ![](image)\u00a0Austria[68]\n* ![](image)\u00a0Japan\n* ![](image)\u00a0India[69]\n* ![](image)\u00a0China\n* ![](image)\u00a0South Korea\n* ![](image)\u00a0Pakistan[70]\n* ![](image)\u00a0Egypt\n* ![](image)\u00a0South Africa\n* ![](image)\u00a0Nigeria[71]\n* ![](image)\u00a0Jordan\n* ![](image)\u00a0Tunisia\n* ![](image)\u00a0Turkey[72]\n* ![](image)\u00a0Lebanon\n* ![](image)\u00a0Morocco\n* ![](image)\u00a0Thailand\n\n### Competitive innovation[edit]\n\n\nIn the 2021 review of WIPO's annual World Intellectual Property Indicators Procter & Gamble ranked ninth in the world, with 57 designs in industrial design registrations being published under the Hague System during 2020.[73] This position is down on their previous sixth-place ranking for 65 industrial design registrations being published in 2019.[74]\n\n\n\n### Radio and television production[edit]\n\n\nProcter & Gamble produced and sponsored the first radio serial dramas in the 1930s. As the company was known for Ivory soap, the serials became known as \"soap operas\". With the rise of television in the 1950s and 1960s, most of the new serials were sponsored, produced and owned (20 series) by the company (including *The Guiding Light*, which had begun as a radio serial, and made the transition to television lasting 72 years).[75] Though the last P&G-produced show, *As the World Turns,* left the air in 2010,[75] *The Young and the Restless*, produced by Sony Pictures Television and broadcast on CBS, is still partially sponsored by Procter & Gamble; as of 2017, it is the only remaining daytime drama that is partially sponsored by Procter & Gamble.\n\n\nThese past serials were produced by Procter & Gamble:\n\n\n\n* *Another World*\n* *As the World Turns*[75]\n* *The Brighter Day*\n* *The Catlins*\n* *The Edge of Night*\n* *The First Hundred Years*\n* *From These Roots*\n* *Guiding Light*[75]\n* *Lovers and Friends* / *For Richer, for Poorer*\n* *Our Private World*\n* *Search for Tomorrow*\n* *Somerset*\n* *Texas*\n* *Young Doctor Malone*\n\nProcter & Gamble also was the first company to produce and sponsor a prime-time serial, a 1965 spin-off of *As the World Turns* called *Our Private World*. In 1979, PGP produced *Shirley*, a prime-time NBC series starring Shirley Jones, which lasted 13 episodes. They also produced TBS' first original comedy series, *Down to Earth*, which ran from 1984 to 1987 (110 episodes were produced). They also distributed the syndicated comedy series *Throb*. In 1985, they produced a game-show pilot called *The Buck Stops Here* with Taft Entertainment Television in 1985, hosted by Jim Peck; it was not picked up. Procter & Gamble Productions originally co-produced *Dawson's Creek* with Columbia TriStar Television but withdrew before the series premiere due to early press reviews. They also produced the 1991 TV movie *A Triumph of the Heart: The Ricky Bell Story*, which was co-produced by The Landsburg Company,[76] and they continued to produce the People's Choice Awards[75] until the show was sold to E! channel in April 2017.[77] In 2007, PGP teamed up with the now-defunct Cookie Jar Group to produce the Flash-animated children's series *Will and Dewitt*, which featured the character Dewitt, the mascot for the Pampers baby product line's former sub-brand, Kandoo.\n\n\nWith Walmart, PGP sponsored Family Movie Night on broadcast networks in 2010\u20132011[78] and Walden Family Theater on the Hallmark Channel in 2013.[79]\n\n\nIn 2013, PGP rebranded itself as Procter & Gamble Entertainment (PGE) with a new logo and an emphasis on multiple-platform entertainment production.\n\n\nP&G funded a six-episode series, *Activate*, on National Geographic in 2019 focusing on extreme poverty, inequality and sustainability in conjunction with not-for-profit Global Citizen and production company Radical Media.[80] The company agreed to a longform series deal with Stone Village Television in January 2020. In February 2020, P&G joined Imagine Documentaries' five project slate including *Mars 2080*, the project closest to production.[81]\n\n\n\n### Sponsorships[edit]\n\n\nIn addition to its self-produced items through PGE, Procter & Gamble also supports many Spanish-language novellas through advertising on all networks: Azteca Am\u00e9rica, Estrella TV, Galavisi\u00f3n, Telemundo, UniM\u00e1s and Univisi\u00f3n. P&G was one of the first mainstream advertisers on Spanish-language TV during the mid-1980s.[*citation needed*] By the late 1990s, P&G was established as the largest advertiser on Spanish-language media.[82]\n\n\nIn 2008, P&G expanded into music sponsorship when it joined Island Def Jam to create Tag Records, named after a body spray that P&G acquired from Gillette.[83][84] In 2010, after the cancellation of *As the World Turns*, PGP announced they were phasing out soap opera production and expanding into more family-appropriate programming.[85]\n\n\nProcter & Gamble also gave a $100,000 contract to the winners of Cycles 1 through 3 of *Canada's Next Top Model*, wherein Andrea Muizelaar, Rebecca Hardy, and Meaghan Waller won the prize.\n\n\nProcter & Gamble has been a major sponsor of the Summer Olympics since 2012. It sponsored 150 athletes at the London games that year.[86] They have also sponsored the Winter Olympics since 2014. It will do so at the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, France besides the 2026 Winter Olympics in Cortina d'Ampezzo/Milan, Italy. The company's sponsorship includes television ads in which Olympic athletes are portrayed as children to convey the sense that the mothers of these athletes still remember them as infants; other ads stress how Olympic mothers stood by their children through years of training all the way through to Olympic success. 2016's ad for the Rio Games notes upheavals as youths by an American gymnast, Chinese swimmer, Brazilian volleyballer, and German distance runner. The ads all make prominent use of the Ludovico Einaudi orchestral track \"Divenire\" and related such instrumentals.\n\n\nThe company has actively developed or sponsored numerous online communities,[87] e.g. BeingGirl.com (launched in 2000)[88] and Women.com.[87] As of 2000[update], the company had 72 \"highly stylized destination sites\".[89]\n\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\n### Price fixing[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2011, P&G was fined \u20ac211.2 million by the European Commission for establishing a price-fixing cartel for washing powder in Europe along with Unilever, which was fined \u20ac104\u00a0million, and Henkel. Though the fine was set higher at first, it was discounted by 10% after P&G and Unilever admitted running the cartel. As the provider of the tip-off leading to investigations, Henkel was not fined.[90]\n\n\n\n### Toxic shock syndrome and tampons[edit]\n\n\nToxic shock syndrome (TSS) is a disease caused by strains of the bacteria *Staphylococcus aureus*. Most people have these bacteria living in their bodies as harmless commensals in places such as the nose, skin, and vagina. The disease can strike anyone, not only women, but the disease is often associated with tampons.\nIn 1980, 814 menstrual-related TSS cases were reported; 38 deaths resulted from the disease. The majority of women in these cases were documented as using super-absorbent synthetic tampons, particularly the Rely tampon created by Procter & Gamble.[91] Unlike other tampons made of cotton and rayon, Rely used carboxymethylcellulose and compressed beads of polyester for absorption.\n\n\nIn the summer of 1980, the Centers for Disease Control released a report explaining how these bacterial mechanisms were leading to TSS. They also stated that the Rely tampon was associated with TSS more than any other brand of tampon. In September 1980, Procter & Gamble voluntarily recalled its Rely brand of tampons from the market.[92] Since the 1980s, reported cases of TSS have dramatically decreased.[93]\n\n\n\n### Child labor and forced labor[edit]\n\n\nAccording to a 2016 report by Amnesty International, palm oil provider Wilmar International, the world's biggest palm oil grower in 2016 and supplier of raw materials to Procter & Gamble, profited from 8 to 14-year-old child labor and forced labor. Some workers were extorted, threatened, or not paid for work. Some workers also suffered severe injuries from toxic banned chemicals.[94]\n\n\n\n### Animal testing[edit]\n\n\nProcter & Gamble has received criticism from animal advocacy group PETA for the practice of testing on animals.[95]\n\n\nOn June 30, 1999, Procter & Gamble announced that it would limit its animal testing practices to its food and drug products which represented less than 20% of its product portfolio.[96] The company invested more than $275\u00a0million in the development of alternative testing methods.[97]\n\n\n\n### Other products[edit]\n\n\nIn 2002, P&G was sued for its ads falsely suggesting to the consumers that the drug Prilosec could cure heartburn in a day.[98] In December 2005, the Pharmaceutical division of P&G was involved in a dispute over research involving its osteoporosis drug Actonel. The case was discussed in the media.[99]\n\n\n\n### Logo myth and Satanism accusations[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Former P&G logo, which was accused of being a Satanist symbol. In 1989, its details were simplified to avoid satanic links.\nP&G's former logo originated in 1851 as a crude cross that barge workers on the Ohio River painted on cases of P&G star candles to identify them. P&G later changed this symbol into a trademark that showed a man in the Moon overlooking 13 stars, said to commemorate the original Thirteen Colonies.[100]\n\n\nThe company received unwanted media publicity in the 1980s due to rumors, spread largely by Amway distributors, that the Moon-and-stars logo was a satanic symbol. The accusation was based on a particular passage in the Bible, specifically Revelation 12:1, which states: \"And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, the moon under her feet and upon her head a crown of 12 stars.\" P&G's logo consisted of a man's face on the Moon surrounded by 13 stars. Some claimed that the logo was a mockery of the heavenly symbol alluded to in the aforementioned verse, thus construing the logo to be satanic. Where the flowing beard meets the surrounding circle, three curls were said to be a mirror image of the number *666*, or the reflected number of the beast. At the top and bottom, the hair curls in on itself and was said to be the two horns like those of a ram. The moon-and-stars logo was claimed to be discontinued in 1985 in a failed attempt to quash the rumors.[101] In 1991, details of the logo were simplified to avoid the connection and remove aspects alleged to indicate Satanist affiliations.[102][103] The company moved to a text-only logo in 1995, though in 2013 it unveiled a new logo with a hint of a crescent moon behind the text.[103]\n\n\nThese interpretations have been denied by company officials and no evidence linking the company to the Church of Satan or any other occult organization has ever been presented. The company unsuccessfully sued Amway from 1995 to 2003 over rumors forwarded through a company voice-mail system in 1995. In 2007, the company successfully sued individual Amway distributors for reviving and propagating the false rumors.[104] The Church of Satan denies being supported by Procter & Gamble.[105]\n\n\n\n### Reverse domain name hijacking[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2013, P&G was found by a World Intellectual Property Organization panel to have engaged in reverse domain hijacking in an attempt to obtain the domain name \"swash.com\" from Marchex in a Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy proceeding. P&G originally stated it had generated more than $40 million in sales of its Swash laundry products over four years, a figure it later revised to $60,000.[106] After losing the case P&G purchased the domain name from Marchex.[107] In 2013 attorney John Berryhill suggested that P&G did not intend to use the swash.com domain to market its existing range, as it had said, but rather a new product described in a 2011 trademark application as \"An appliance for domestic use in the nature of a garment steamer for the purpose of removing wrinkles and odors from clothing and linen\". Berryhill's theory was shown to be accurate after swash.com went live in June 2014.[108]\n\n\n\n### \"The Talk\"[edit]\n\n\nIn 2017, as part of the \"My Black is Beautiful\" platform, P&G released an advertisement called \"The Talk\".[109] The advertisement shows African American mothers throughout the decades giving their children \"the talk\" about racism.[110] The advertisement garnered controversy for several different reasons.[111] Some people criticized the advertisement for not showing any fathers giving \"the talk\", while others accused it of being anti-white.[112] One scene shows a mother warning her daughter about being pulled over by the police. The daughter responds by saying that she is a good driver so her mother doesn't need to worry about her getting a ticket. The mother then implies that she might experience police brutality by being racially profiled and killed.[113] Several police officers and police groups accused that part of the advertisement of being anti-cop.[112][114] \"The Talk\" was accused by Michelle Malkin of *National Review* of being \"liberal advertising\". Malkin also called the advertisement \"Black Lives Matter propaganda\" and accused it of pandering and using identity politics.[115] Despite the criticism, the advertisement also received a lot of positive reception and praise with some calling it \"powerful\"[116] and \"thought-provoking\".[109] The advertisement has also won several awards including the 2018 Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity Grand Prix[117] and the 2018 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Commercial during the 70th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards.[118]\n\n\n\n### Gillette ad[edit]\n\n\nMain article: The Best Men Can Be\n\nOn January 14, 2019, P&G subsidiary Gillette released a controversial advertisement called \"The Best Men Can Be\", ostensibly to address negative behavior among men, including bullying, sexism, sexual misconduct, and toxic masculinity. The ad was the subject of controversy and was received negatively by various online commentators, becoming one of the most disliked videos on YouTube.[119][120]\n\n\nThe ad led to calls for boycott of Gillette and Procter & Gamble.[121][122][123][124][125][126] Later in the year, its Gillette shaving business took an $8 billion write-down in value, although the company and analysts pointed to accumulated currency fluctuations, the entrance of strong rivals and decline in the demand for shaving products since the division's previous valuation in 2005, rather than fallout from the ad.[127][128][129][130][131][132][133]\n\n\n\n### Trade in Russia amid Ukraine war[edit]\n\n\nThe National Agency for the Prevention of Corruption of Ukraine have put P&G on the list of international sponsors of the war. According to the NAPC, P&G has two factories operating in Russia (the Gillette razor manufacturing plant in Saint Petersburg and a toiletries manufacturing plant in Tula oblast), thus contributing to the Russian federal budget and financing Russian war crimes.[134] It was named \"an international sponsor of war\" by the Ukrainian government after Russia obliged all large companies operating in the country \"to contribute directly to its war effort\". It was placed on the list alongside Bacardi and Unilever.[135]\n\n\n\n## Corporate diversity[edit]\n\n\nIn January 2019, CEO David Taylor said in Switzerland: \"The world would be a better place if my board of directors on down is represented by 50% of the women. We sell our products to more than 50% of the women.\" Also in January 2019, *The Wall Street Journal* noted the company's board of directors had more than twice as many men as it does women.[136] As of mid-2020, the board of P&G consisted of an equal number of men and women.[137][138]\n\n\n\n## CEO-to-worker pay ratio[edit]\n\n\nFor the first time in 2018, a new Securities and Exchange Commission rule mandated under the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform requires publicly traded companies to disclose how their CEOs are compensated in comparison with their employees. In public filings, companies have to disclose their \u201cPay Ratios,\u201d or the CEO's compensation divided by the median employee's.[139] According to SEC filings, P&G paid its CEO $17,354,256 in 2017. In 2021, the median employee of Procter & Gamble was compensated $66,326 in 2017, and ratio between CEO pay to median worker pay was 309-to-1, compared to median of 141-to-1 across the S&P500 and the Russell 1000.[140][141]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"P&G Co. 2023 Annual Report (Form 10-K)\".

It is currently headquartered in London.\n\n\nUnilever products include baby food, beauty products, bottled water, breakfast cereals, cleaning agents, condiments, energy drinks, healthcare and hygiene products, ice cream, instant coffee, pet food, pharmaceuticals, soft drinks, tea, and toothpaste. It is the largest producer of soap in the world,[3] and its products are available in over 190 countries.[4]\n\n\nUnilever's largest brands include Axe (Lynx), Ben & Jerry's, Dove, Hellmann's, Knorr, Lifebuoy, Lux, Magnum, Omo (Persil), Rexona, Sunlight, Sunsilk, and Wall's (Heartbrand).[4] The company is organised into five business groups: Beauty & Wellbeing, Personal Care, Home Care, Nutrition, and Ice Cream. It has research and development facilities in China, India, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States.[5]\n\n\nIn the 1930s, Unilever acquired the United Africa Company. During the second half of the 20th century, the company increasingly diversified from being a maker of products made of oils and fats, and expanded its operations worldwide. It has made numerous corporate acquisitions, including Lipton (1971), Brooke Bond (1984), Chesebrough-Ponds (1987), Hellmann's (2000), Ben & Jerry's (2000), Slim-Fast (2000), Knorr (2000), Alberto-Culver (2010), Dollar Shave Club (2016), and Pukka Herbs (2017). Unilever divested its specialty chemicals businesses to Imperial Chemical Industries in 1997. In the 2010s, under the leadership of Paul Polman, the company gradually shifted its focus towards health and beauty brands and away from food brands that showed slow growth.[6]\n\n\nUnilever has a primary listing on the London Stock Exchange and a secondary listing on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index and the AEX index.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lever House in Port Sunlight, United Kingdom, the former headquarters of Lever Brothers\n### 1921\u20131940[edit]\n\n\nIn September 1929, Unilever was formed by a merger of the operations of Dutch Margarine Unie and British soapmaker Lever Brothers, with the name of the resulting company a portmanteau of the name of both companies.[7] \nIn the 1930s, the business grew, and new ventures were launched in Africa and Latin America. During this time, Unilever acquired the United Africa Company, created from a merger of the African & Eastern Trade Corporation and the Royal Niger Company, which oversaw British trade interests in present-day Nigeria during the colonial era.[8]\nThe Nazi occupation of Europe during the Second World War meant that Unilever was unable to reinvest its capital into Europe, so it instead acquired new businesses in the United Kingdom and the United States.[9]\n\n\nIn 1943, it acquired T. J. Lipton, a majority stake in Frosted Foods (owner of the Birds Eye brand in the UK)[10] and Batchelors Peas, one of the largest vegetables canners in the United Kingdom.[11][12] In 1944, Pepsodent was acquired.[12]\n\n\nIn 1933, Unilever Indonesia was established in December as Lever Zeepfabrieken N.V. and had operations in Cikarang, West Java at Rungkut, East Java and North Sumatra.[13]\n\n\n\n### 1941\u20131960[edit]\n\n\nAfter 1945, Unilever's once-successful American businesses (Lever Brothers and T.J. Lipton) began to decline.[14] As a result, Unilever began to operate a \"hands-off\" policy towards the subsidiaries and left American management to its own devices.[14]\n\n\nSunsilk was first launched in the United Kingdom in 1954.[15] Dove was first launched in the US in 1957.[15] Unilever took full ownership of Frosted Foods in 1957, which it renamed Birds Eye.[16] The US-based Good Humor ice cream business was acquired in 1961.[17] By the mid-1960s, laundry soap and edible fats still contributed around half of Unilever's corporate profits.[11] However, a stagnant market for yellow fats (butter, margarine, and similar products) and increasing competition in detergents and soaps from Procter & Gamble forced Unilever to diversify.[11] In 1971, Unilever acquired the British-based Lipton Ltd from Allied Suppliers.[11] In 1978, National Starch was acquired for $487\u00a0million, marking the largest ever foreign-acquisition of a US company at that point.[18]\n\n\n\n### 1961\u20131980[edit]\n\n\nBy the end of the 1970s through acquisitions, Unilever had gained 30 per cent of the Western European ice cream market.[11] In 1982, Unilever management decided to reposition itself from an unwieldy conglomerate to a more concentrated fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) company.[19]\n\n\nIn 1984, Unilever acquired Brooke Bond (maker of PG Tips tea) for \u00a3390\u00a0million in the company's first successful hostile takeover.[11] In 1986, Unilever strengthened its position in the world skin care market by acquiring Chesebrough-Ponds (merged from Chesebrough Manufacturing and Pond's Creams), the maker of Rag\u00fa, Pond's, Aqua-Net, Cutex, and Vaseline in another hostile takeover.[19] In 1989, Unilever bought Calvin Klein Cosmetics, Faberg\u00e9, and Elizabeth Arden, but the latter was later sold (in 2000) to FFI Fragrances.[20]\n\n\n\n### 1981\u20132000[edit]\n\n\nIn 1992, Unilever Ghana was established in July following a merger of UAC Ghana Limited and Lever Brothers Ghana Limited.[21]\n\n\nIn 1993, Unilever acquired Breyers from Kraft, which made the company the largest ice cream manufacturer in the United States.[22]\n\n\nIn 1996, Unilever merged Elida Gibbs and Lever Brothers in its UK operations.[23] It also purchased Helene Curtis, significantly expanding its presence in the United States shampoo and deodorant market.[20] The purchase brought Unilever the Suave and Finesse hair-care product brands and Degree deodorant brand.[20]\n\n\nIn 1997, Unilever sold its speciality chemicals division, including National Starch & Chemical, Quest, Unichema and Crosfield to Imperial Chemical Industries for \u00a34.9\u00a0billion.[24]\n\n\nIn 1998, Unilever established a sustainable agriculture programme.[25]\n\n\nIn 2000, Unilever acquired the boutique mustard retailer Maille,[26] Ben & Jerry's and Slim Fast for \u00a31.63\u00a0billion,[27][28] Bestfoods for \u00a313.4\u00a0billion.[29] The Bestfoods acquisition increased Unilever's scale in foods in America, and added brands including Knorr, Marmite, Bovril, and Hellmann's to its portfolio.[29] In exchange for European regulatory approval of the deal, Unilever divested itself of Oxo, Lesieur, McDonnells, Bla Band, Royco, and Batchelors.[30][31]\n\n\n\n### 2001\u20132010[edit]\n\n\n![](image)**Global employment at Unilever 2000\u201308**  \n Black represents employment numbers in Europe, light grey represents the Americas and dark grey represents Asia and Africa.  \nBetween 2000 and 2008 Unilever reduced global workforce numbers by 41%, from 295,000 to 174,000.  \n Notes: Europe figures for 2000\u20132003 are all Europe; from 2004 figures in black are Western Europe. For 2004\u20132008 figures for Asia and Africa include Eastern and Central Europe.  \n*Source: Unilever Annual Reports 2004, 2008*\nIn 2001, Unilever split into two divisions: one for foods and one for home and personal care.[32] In the UK, it merged its Lever Brothers and Elida Faberge businesses as Lever Faberge in January 2001.[33]\n\n\nIn 2003, Unilever announced the strategic decision to sell off the Dalda brand in both India and Pakistan.[34] In 2003, Bunge Limited acquired the Dalda brand from Hindustan Unilever Limited for reportedly under Rs 1\u00a0billion.[35] On 30 March 2004, Unilever Pakistan accepted an offer of Rs. 1.33\u00a0billion for the sale of its Dalda brand and related business of edible oils and fats to the newly incorporated company Dalda Foods (Pvt.) Limited.[36]\n\n\nIn 2002, the company sold its specialty oils and fats division, known as Loders Croklaan, for RM814\u00a0million (\u20ac218.5\u00a0million) to IOI Corporation, a Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia-based oil palm company. As part of the deal, the Loders Croklaan name was maintained.[37] Unilever sold the brands Mazola, Argo & Kingsfords, Karo, Golden Griddle, and Henri's, along with several of its Canadian brands, to ACH Food Companies, an American subsidiary of Associated British Foods.[38]\n\n\nIn 2004, Unilever Bangladesh, which was established in 1964[39] changed its former name Lever Brothers Bangladesh Ltd to its present name in December 2004,[40] is owned 60.4% by Unilever and 39.6% by the Government of Bangladesh.[41][42]\n\n\nIn 2007, Unilever partnered with Rainforest Alliance to sustainably source all its tea.[43]\n\n\nIn 2009, Unilever agreed to acquire the personal care business of Sara Lee Corporation, including brands such as Radox, Badedas and Duschdas.[44] The Sara Lee acquisition was completed on 6 December 2010.[45]\n\n\nIn 2010, Unilever acquired the Diplom-Is in Denmark,[46] Unilever announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to sell its consumer tomato products business in Brazil to Cargill,[47] purchased Alberto-Culver, a maker of personal care and household products including Simple, VO5, Nexxus, TRESemm\u00e9, and Mrs. Dash, for US$3.7\u00a0billion.[48] acquired EVGA's ice cream brands, which included Scandal, Variete and Karabola, and its distribution network in Greece, for an undisclosed amount.[49]\n\n\n\n### 2011\u20132020[edit]\n\n\nIn 2012, Unilever announced it would phase out the use of microplastics in the form of microbeads in their personal care products by 2015.[50]\n\n\nIn 2014, Unilever agreed to acquire a majority stake in the China-based water purification company Qinyuan for an undisclosed price,[51] acquired Talenti Gelato & Sorbetto,[52] acquired Camay brand globally and the Zest brand outside of North America and the Caribbean from Procter & Gamble.[53]\n\n\nIn 2015, Unilever acquired British niche skincare brand REN Skincare,[54] This was followed in May 2015 by the acquisition of Kate Somerville Skincare LLC.[55] The company also acquired the Italian premium ice cream maker GROM for an undisclosed amount.[56] Unilever also separated its food spreads business,[57] including its Flora and I Can't Believe It's Not Butter! brands, into a standalone entity named Unilever Baking, Cooking and Spreading.[58] The separation was first announced in December 2014 and was made in response to declining worldwide sales in that product category.[59]\n\n\nUnilever bought the United States-based startup company Dollar Shave Club for a reported $1b (\u00a3764m) to compete in the male grooming market.[60] On 16 August 2016, Unilever acquired Blueair, a supplier of mobile indoor air purification technologies.[61] In September 2016, Unilever acquired Seventh Generation Inc. for $700\u00a0million.[62] On 16 December 2016, Unilever acquired Living Proof Inc, a hair care products business.[63]\n\n\nIn 2017, significantly smaller Kraft Heinz made a $143\u00a0billion bid for Unilever.[64][65] The deal was declined by Unilever.[66] On 20 April 2017, Unilever acquired Sir Kensington's, a New York-based condiment maker.[67] On 15 May 2017, the company acquired the personal care and home care brands of Quala, a Latin American consumer goods company.[68] In June, the company acquired Hourglass, a colour cosmetics brand.[69] In July, the company then announced that it had acquired the organic herbal tea business, Pukka Herbs.[70] In September 2017, Unilever acquired Weis, an Australian ice cream business.[71] Later that month Unilever acquired Remgro's interest in Unilever South Africa in exchange for the Unilever South Africa spreads business plus cash consideration.[72] Even later that month, Unilever agreed to acquire Carver Korea, with 2.7billion USD, a skincare business brand of AHC in North Asia.[73] In October 2017, Unilever acquired Brazilian natural and organic food business M\u00e3e Terra.[74] In November, Unilever announced an agreement to acquire the Tazo speciality tea brand from Starbucks.[75] Later in November 2017, the company acquired Sundial Brands, a skincare company.[76] In December 2017, Unilever acquired Schmidt's Naturals, a US natural deodorant and soap company.[77] In December 2017, Unilever sold its margarine and spreads division to investment firm KKR for \u20ac6.8bn.[78][79] The sale was completed in July 2018, and the new company was named Upfield.[80] Upfield's notable brands include Flora, Stork, I Can't Believe It's Not Butter, Rama, Country Crock, Becel, and Blue Band.[81]\n\n\nUnilever announced that to help tackle the global COVID-19 pandemic, it would contribute over \u20ac100m through donations of soap, hand sanitiser, bleach and food.[82][83]\n\n\n\n### 2021\u2013present[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2021, Unilever established a new stand-alone beauty business, Elida Beauty, which will own and manage the following brands: Brut, Brylcreem, Timotei, Q-tips, Noxema, TIGI, VO5, Toni & Guy, Matey, Moussel, Monsavon, Impulse, St Ives, Alberto Balsam, Badedas, Fissan, Pento, Pond's, Careess, Lever 2000, Williams, Elida, and Alberto.\n[84]\n\n\nIn August 2021, Florida governor Ron DeSantis placed Unilever on a list of \"Scrutinized Companies that Boycott Israel\" because it had \"no current plan to prevent Ben & Jerry's from terminating business activities in Israeli-controlled territories\". The ice-cream brand has 90 days to stop engaging in \"the BDS movement\", or the state will no longer contract with the parent company Unilever or any of its subsidiaries.[85]\n\n\nIn November 2021, Unilever agreed to sell most of its tea business under the Ekaterra division to investment firm CVC Capital Partners for \u20ac4.5\u00a0billion. This deal excluded the Unilever tea business in India, Indonesia and Nepal, and the Lipton Ice Tea joint-venture with PepsiCo.[86] The deal was completed in summer 2022.[87]\n\n\n\n## Corporate operations[edit]\n\n\n### Legal structure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Former head office building of Unilever N.V. which now became the HQ for the merged group's food and refreshments division, Rotterdam\nUnilever has a holding company Unilever PLC and N.V. with Anglo-Dutch structure, which has its registered office at Port Sunlight in Merseyside, United Kingdom and its head office at Unilever House in London, United Kingdom.[88] The company has been restructured several times, for example in 2018 and 2020 (see \"history\").[89][90]\n\n\nIn 2018, Unilever announced its intention to simplify this structure by centralising the duality of legal entities and keeping just one headquarters in Rotterdam, abandoning the London head office. Business groups and staff would have been unaffected, as would the dual listing.[89] On 5 October 2018 the group announced it would cancel the restructuring due to concern that the United Kingdom shareholders would lose value if the company fell out of the London FTSE100.[91][92] A shareholder vote was planned to decide for the listing of a new Unilever Dutch entity, which would have seen Unilever dropping out of the FTSE 100 Index.[93] When it appeared that the vote would fail, due to uncertainty over the Netherlands dividend tax, the scheme was cancelled on 5 October 2018.[94]\n\n\nIn October 2018, it acquired[95] a 75% stake in the Italian personal-care business Equilibra[96] and acquired the high-end, eco-friendly laundry and household cleaning products company The Laundress for an undisclosed sum.[97] In 2018, UK recruitment website Indeed, named Unilever as the United Kingdom's ninth best private sector employer[98] based on millions of employee ratings and reviews.[99]\n\n\nIn 2020, Unilever announced it has reviewed its corporate structure again and that the company was to merge Unilever N.V. into Unilever PLC forming one holding company to be based in the United Kingdom.[100] However, a Dutch 'exit tax' plan would require Unilever to reconsider this unification.[90][101] In September 2020 Unilever's Dutch arm shareholders overwhelmingly voted for the N.V. to merge into the PLC.[102] In October 2020 Unilever announced that 99 per cent of shareholders in its UK arm agreed with the merger, i.e., voted to base the group in London.[103][104][105] The completion of the unification was announced on 30 November 2020. Since then there is one class of shares.[106]\n\n\n\n### Senior management[edit]\n\n\nIn January 2019, Alan Jope succeeded Paul Polman as the chief executive officer.[107] The chief financial officer, Graeme Pitkethly,[108] is executive director. Jope will be proposed as joint executive director at Unilever's 2019 AGM.[109]\n\n\nPreviously, Paul Polman was CEO for ten years, succeeding Patrick Cescau in 2009.[110]\n\n\nIn November 2019, Unilever announced that Nils Andersen would be replacing Chairman Marijn Dekkers, who stepped down after three years in the role.[111]\n\n\nIn January 2023, it announced Hein Schumacher as its new CEO, effective July 2023.[112]\n\n\n\n### Gallery of global assets[edit]\n\n\n* ![Unilever R&D Centre in Bangalore, India](image)\n\nUnilever R&D Centre in Bangalore, India\n* ![Unilever R&D Centre in Colworth, United Kingdom](image)\n\nUnilever R&D Centre in Colworth, United Kingdom\n* ![Unilever R&D Centre in Port Sunlight, United Kingdom](image)\n\nUnilever R&D Centre in Port Sunlight, United Kingdom\n* ![Unilever-Haus in Hamburg, Germany](image)\n\nUnilever-Haus in Hamburg, Germany\n* ![Soap factory in Mannheim, Germany](image)\n\nSoap factory in Mannheim, Germany\n\n\n### Financial data[edit]\n\n\n\n\n**Financial data in \u20ac billions**[113]\n| Year\n | 2011\n | 2012\n | 2013\n | 2014\n | 2015\n | 2016\n | 2017\n | 2018\n | 2019\n | 2020\n | 2021\n | 2022\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Revenue | 46.467\n | 51.324\n | 49.797\n | 48.436\n | 53.272\n | 52.713\n | 53.715\n | 50.982\n | 51.980\n | 50.724\n | 52.444\n | 60.073\n |\n| Net Income | 4.252\n | 4.480\n | 4.842\n | 5.171\n | 4.909\n | 5.184\n | 6.053\n | 9.389\n | 5.625\n | 5.581\n | 6.621\n | 8.269\n |\n| Assets | 29.583\n | 30.351\n | 28.131\n | 28.385\n | 32.279\n | 35.873\n | 37.108\n | 39.684\n | 64.806\n | 67.659\n | 75.095\n | 77.821\n |\n| Employees\n | 171,000\n | 172,000\n | 174,000\n | 173,000\n | 169,000\n | 169,000\n | 165,000\n | 158,000\n | 153,000\n | 155,000\n | 149,000\n | 148,000\n |\n\n\n### Operations[edit]\n\n\nThe three markets of the United States, China and India account for over one third of turnover.[114]\n\n\nThirteen brands account for over half of sales.[114]\n\n\n\n## Branding and advertising[edit]\n\n\nUnilever's largest international competitors are Nestl\u00e9 and Procter & Gamble.[115]\n\n\n\n### Logo[edit]\n\n\nIn 1930, the logo of Unilever was in a sans-serif typeface and all-caps.

The 'U' shape is now made up of 25 distinct symbols, each icon representing one of the company's sub-brands or its corporate values.[116] The brand identity was developed around the idea of \"adding vitality to life\".[117]\n\n\n\n### Brands[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of Unilever brands\n\n#### Dove[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Dove shampoo and conditioner\nDove describes itself as being dedicated to \"help\u00a0... women develop a positive relationship with the way they look \u2013 helping them raise their self-esteem and realize their full potential\".[118] Dove uses advertising to display messages of positive self-esteem. In September 2004 Dove created a Real Beauty campaign,[119] focusing predominately on women of all shapes and colour. Later in 2007, this campaign furthered itself to include women of all ages. This campaign consisted mostly of advertisements, shown on television and popularised by the internet. Dove fell under scrutiny from the general public as they felt the Dove advertisements described the opinion that cellulite was still unsightly and that women's aging process was something for which to be ashamed.[120]\n\n\n\n#### Lynx/Axe[edit]\n\n\nAxe, known as Lynx in the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, Australia and New Zealand, is a toiletries brand marketed towards young men between the ages of 16 and 24.[121] Its marketing is a \"tongue-in-cheek take on the 'mating game'\", suggesting that women are instantly drawn to men who use the products.[122][123] Unlike Dove's long-running beauty campaign, Lynx advertising often creates mini-series of advertisements based around a singular product rather than communicating an overarching idea. Using images the company knows it will receive complaints garners the brand more free publicity and notoriety, often through controversy. A wide variety of these adverts have been banned in countries around the world. In 2012, Lynx's 'Clean Balls' advert was banned. In 2011, in the United Kingdom, Lynx's shower gel campaign was banned.[122][124]\n\n\nBoth advertising campaigns make stark comparisons between how women and their sexuality are portrayed in advertising and sales efficiency. Lynx commonly portrays women as hypersexual, flawless and stereotypically attractive who are aroused by men, of all ages and stature, because of their use of the Lynx product.[121]\n\n\n\n### Social media advertising[edit]\n\n\nOn 26 June 2020, Unilever said it would halt advertising to U.S. customers on social media giants Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter until at least the end of 2020 following a campaign started by various American civil-rights groups, such as the Anti-Defamation League and the NAACP, protesting Facebook's policies on hate speech and misinformation named \"Stop Hate For Profit\".[125][126] However, Unilever did not formally sign on to the campaign. The company cited their \"Responsibility Framework and the polarized atmosphere in the U.S.\" and said that \"continuing to advertise on these platforms at this time would not add value to people and society\".[127]\n\n\nLater that year in December, Unilever revealed it would resume advertising on Facebook and its affiliated platforms, stating that Facebook had made enough progress in changing their management to continue advertising with them. Executive vice president of global media for the company, Luis Di Como, released a clarifying statement: \"We are encouraged by the commitments the platforms are making to build healthier environments for consumers, brands and society in alignment with the principles of the Global Alliance for Responsible Media. This is why we plan to end our social media investment pause in the U.S. in January. We will continue to reassess our position as necessary.\"[125]\n\n\n\n### Corporate sponsorship[edit]\n\n\nFrom 2000 to 2012 Unilever sponsored the Turbine Hall commissions at Tate Modern, which became known as The Unilever Series.[128]\n\n\n\n## Environmental record[edit]\n\n\n### Mercury contamination[edit]\n\n\nIn 2001, a mercury thermometer factory operated by the Indian subsidiary of Unilever in the South Indian hilltown of Kodaikanal was shut down by state regulators after the company was caught dumping toxic mercury wastes in a densely populated part of town.[129] By the company's own admissions, more than 2 tonnes of mercury were discharged into Kodaikanal's environment. A 2011 Government of India study on workers' health concluded that many workers suffered from illnesses caused by workplace exposure to mercury.[130] The scandal opened up a series of issues in India such as corporate liability, corporate accountability and corporate negligence.[130]\n\n\nIn March 2016, Unilever reached an out of court settlement (for an undisclosed amount) with 591 ex-workers of the unit who had sued the company for knowingly exposing them to the toxic element.[131]\n\n\n\n### Palm oil[edit]\n\n\nIn 2014, Unilever was criticised by Greenpeace for causing deforestation.[132] In 2008, Greenpeace UK[133] criticised the company for buying palm oil from suppliers that were damaging Indonesia's rainforests.[134] By 2008, Indonesia was losing 2% of its remaining rainforest each year, having the fastest deforestation rate of any country. The United Nations Environmental Programme stated that palm oil plantations are the leading cause of deforestation in Indonesia.[134]\n\n\nFurthermore, Indonesia was the 14th[135] largest emitter of greenhouse gases, largely due to the destruction of rainforests for the palm oil industry, which contributed to 4% of global green house gas emissions.[136] According to Greenpeace, palm oil expansion was taking place with little oversight from central or local government as procedures for environmental impact assessment, land-use planning and ensuring a proper process for development of concessions were neglected.[136] Plantations that were off-limits, by law, for palm oil plantations were being established as well as the illegal use of fire to clear forest areas was commonplace.[136]\n\n\nUnilever, as a founding member of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), responded by publicising its plan to obtain all of its palm oil from sources that are certified as sustainable by 2015.[137] It claims to have met this goal in 2012 and is encouraging the rest of the industry to become 100% sustainable by 2020.[138]\n\n\nIn C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, one of Unilever's palm oil suppliers was accused of clearing forest for plantations, an activity that threatened a primate species, Miss Waldron's red colobus. Unilever intervened to halt the clearances pending the results of an environmental assessment.[139]\n\n\nAccording to an Amnesty International report published in 2016, Unilever's palm oil supplier Wilmar International profited from child labour and forced labour. Some workers were extorted, threatened or not paid for work. Some workers suffered severe injuries from banned chemicals. In 2016 Singapore-based Wilmar International was the world's biggest palm oil grower.[140]\n\n\n\n### Plastic pollution[edit]\n\n\nIn 2019, Unilever was cited by BreakFreeFromPlastic as one of the top ten global plastic polluters.[141]\n\n\nNevertheless, in 2019, Unilever announced that it plans to halve its non-recycled plastic packaging by 2025.[142][143] In 2020, Unilever joined 13 EU member states and more than 60 companies to sign a pact to use recycled plastic for all plastic packaging and single-use plastic products by 2025.[144]\n\n\nIn June 2022, a Reuters report revealed that Unilever had lobbied the governments of India and the Philippines to stop legislation which would ban the sale of cosmetics in single-use plastic sachets, despite vowing in 2020 to stop using them.[145] The design of these sachets had been called 'evil' by Hanneke Faber, Unilever's president for Global Food and Refreshments, 'because you cannot recycle it'. The bans were then dropped by lawmakers. In Sri Lanka, the company pressed the government to reconsider a proposed ban on sachets, and then tried to manoeuvre around the ban after regulations were implemented.[145]\n\n\n\n### Rainforest Alliance[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Rainforest Alliance \u00a7\u00a0Criticism and response\n\nUnilever certifies its tea products by the Rainforest Alliance scheme. The company has stated that at least 50% of the tea in its products originates from certified farms, compared to the Alliance's 30% minimum entry point. Unilever decided on the scheme over Fairtrade, because according to the company's analysis, Fairtrade might \"lack the scale and the organizational flexibility to certify industrial tea estates\".[146]\n\n\nThe Rainforest Alliance certification scheme has been criticised for not offering producers minimum or guaranteed price,[147] therefore, leaving them vulnerable to market price variations. The alternative certificate, Fairtrade, has received similar criticism. The Rainforest Alliance certification has furthermore been criticised for allowing the use of the seal on products that contain only a minimum of 30% of certified content, which according to some endangers the integrity of the certification.[148]\n\n\n\n### Salmonella contamination[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2016, rumours about salmonella contamination in cereals spread among Israeli consumers.[149] Initially, Unilever did not provide public information about the subject and queries on the matter were rebuffed by the company as a non-story and nonsense. On 26 July 2016, Unilever had stopped transferring cornflakes to retailer chains.[150] On 28 July, Yedioth Ahronoth reported tens of thousands of boxes of breakfast cereal had been destroyed.[151] By 28 July, despite the company's assurances that nothing contaminated was released for consumption, many customers stopped buying Unilever products and started to throw away all cornflakes made by Unilever.[152] The company withheld information about the affected production dates.[153] Unilever had published more information about Telma cereals handled on the packaging line in which the contamination was discovered and that a Telma announcement had been made: \"We again stress that all Telma products in the stores and in your homes are safe to eat. According to our company's strict procedures, every production batch is checked and put on hold. These products are not marketed until test results for this product series are returned, confirming that all is well. If any flaw is discovered, the batch is not marketed to stores, as was the case.\"[154] In the following days the Health Minister, Yakov Litzman, threatened to pull Unilever's licence in Israel. He accused Unilever of lying to his ministry regarding salmonella-infected breakfast cereals.[155]\n\n\nOn 7 August 2016, *Globes* reported that contamination may be sourced in pigeon faeces, the Health Ministry said that there might be other sources for the contamination and pigeon faeces are not the only possible source. Globes also said that the production line is automatic (\"without human hands\") and the possibility that the source is human is a very slim chance.[156] On 8 August 2016, the Israeli Health minister suspended a manufacturing license until Unilever carry out several corrections; the action came after an inspection of the Arad plant, stating \"This was a series of negligent mistakes and not an incident with malicious intent by the firm's management and quality control procedures.\"[157] An investigation led by Prof. Itamr Grutto and Eli Gordon concluded that the event was caused by negligence.[158] Reportedly the cereals produced between the 18th and 20th at the Arad plant had traces of salmonella.[159]\n\n\nTwo class actions were filed in Israel, one for a sum of 1.2\u00a0million NIS (~$329K USD) against Unilever for hiding the contamination and misleading the public,[160] and another for a sum of 76 million NIS (~$23m USD) against Unilever after a 15-year-old teen had been hospitalised for Salmonellosis after allegedly contracting it from Unilever products.[161]\n\n\nOn 31 August 2016, Unilever stated that the Tehina products produced by RJM had been contaminated by salmonella.[162]\n\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\n### Price-fixing[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2011, Unilever was fined \u20ac104\u00a0million by the European Commission for establishing a price-fixing cartel for washing powder in Europe, along with Procter & Gamble and Henkel.[163][164]\n\n\nIn 2016, Unilever and Procter & Gamble were both fined by Autorit\u00e9 de la concurrence in France for price-fixing on personal hygiene products.[165][166]\n\n\n\n### Hampton Creek lawsuit[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2014, Unilever filed a lawsuit against rival Hampton Creek.[167] In the suit,[168] Unilever claimed that Hampton Creek was \"seizing market share\" and the losses were causing Unilever \"irreparable harm\". Unilever used standard of identity regulations in claiming that Hampton Creek's Just Mayo products are falsely advertised because they don't contain eggs.[169] *The Washington Post*[170] headline on the suit read \"Big Food's Weird War Over The Meaning of Mayonnaise.\" *The Los Angeles Times*[171] began its story with \"Big Tobacco, Big Oil, now Big Mayo?\" A *Wall Street Journal* writer described that \"Giant corporation generates huge quantities of free advertising and brand equity for tiny rival by suing it.\"[172] In December 2014, Unilever dropped the claim.[173]\n\n\n\n### Pressuring media to promote skin whiteners[edit]\n\n\nKinita Shenoy, an editor of the Sri Lanka edition of *Cosmopolitan*, refused to promote skin whiteners for a brand of Unilever. Unilever put pressure on Shenoy and asked *Cosmopolitan* to fire her.[174][175]\n\n\n\n### Violence against striking workers[edit]\n\n\nIn 2019, security forces hired by Unilever attacked workers that were peacefully picketing at a Unilever facility in Durban in South Africa. Workers were shot at with rubber bullets and paint balls and sprayed with pepper spray while attempting to walk to their cars parked on the premises. Four workers were seriously injured.[176]\n\n\n\n### Trade in the occupied Palestinian Territories[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2021, Ben & Jerry's announced plans to end sales in \"Occupied Palestinian Territory\", within which Israeli settlements are considered illegal under international law, while continuing sales in other parts of Israel.[177] Prior to the release of the statement, Unilever had clashed with Ben & Jerry's independent board of directors, which had not wanted to comment on the continuation of sales in other parts of Israel, as this required board approval.[178] Board chair Anuradha Mittalttal said the board had resolved to end sales in Israeli settlements in July 2020, but the CEO, Matthew McCarthy, appointed by Unilever in 2018, \"never operationalized\" the resolution.[178]\n\n\nIn June 2022, Unilever announced that it had sold its Ben & Jerry's division in Israel to American Quality Products, the company that has the exclusive license to sell Ben & Jerry's products in Israel and the Palestinian territories.[179] The sale of the division to American Quality Products allows it to continue to sell Ben & Jerry's products in Israel and the Palestinian territories.[179] Later that day, Ben & Jerry's tweeted that it disagreed with its parent company's decision and that the \"arrangement means Ben & Jerry's in Israel will be owned and operated by AQP. [...] We continue to believe it is inconsistent with Ben & Jerry's values for our ice cream to be sold in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.\"[180][181]\n\n\n\n### Trade in Russia amid the Russo-Ukrainian War[edit]\n\n\nFollowing the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, many Western companies curtailed their operations in Russia.[182] Unilever have temporarily suspended all imports and exports to Russia, but its Russian wing continues to trade there.[183] Between 2021 and 2022 profits in Russia doubled to 9.2\u00a0billion rubles (\u20ac108\u00a0million) and the business paid 3.2\u00a0billion rubles (\u20ac38\u00a0million) in taxes; giving rise to criticism that the company is directly helping to fund Russia's war effort in Ukraine.[184]\n\n\nIn response to this, and claims that the company had broken previous promises to only sell essential items, and to cut all advertising spending in Russia, Unilever's CEO Alan Jope said: \"We still believe that staying is the best option, both to prevent our company from falling directly or indirectly into Russian hands and to protect our people.\"[185]\n\n\nIn July 2023, the Ukrainian National Agency on Corruption Prevention included Unilever in the list of \u201cwar sponsors\u201d for not ceasing operations in Russia, but continuing to profit from this market.[186] It was reported that the company paid \u20ac331\u00a0million in taxes in Russia in 2022, with a spokesperson for the Ukraine Solidarity Project saying: \"Unilever is contributing hundreds of millions in tax revenues to a state which is killing civilians and funding a mercenary group about to be designated a terrorist organisation in the UK. It risks its staff and resources being mobilised into Putin\u2019s machine. Some of the world\u2019s biggest companies have already left Russia. It\u2019s possible \u2013 after 16 months of war \u2013 that the time for excuses has passed.\"[187] In a letter to B4Ukraine, Unilever said it paid 3.8bn roubles (\u00a333m) in tax in 2022, similar to the previous year.[188]\n\n\nIn July 2023, it was reported that Unilever would allow 3,000 of its Russian employees to be conscripted into the Russian army fighting in Ukraine.[189][188]\n\n\nOn 25 July 2023, the new CEO of Unilever, Hein Schumacher, appointed that month, told reporters that the company had considered leaving Russia or selling the business. The first option, according to him, was abandoned, fearing the nationalization of the company, as was the second, because they could not find a worthy buyer. As a result, the continuation of a limited presence in Russia was considered the lesser evil. \"None of the options are actually good, but the final option of operating our business in a constrained manner is the least bad and that is where we are,\" he said.[190]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Companies portal\n\n\n* List of food companies\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Traded through PT Unilever Indonesia Tbk\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** \"Annual Results 2022\" (PDF).

Its product categories consist of: skin care, makeup, body care, hair care, and fragrances. The company is one of the oldest cosmetic companies in the world and celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2022.[4][5] It is the largest cosmetic firm in Japan and the fifth largest cosmetic company in the world.[6] In Japan, Shiseido is available at cosmetic counters at selected department stores and most pharmacies. The company owns numerous brands and subsidiaries worldwide, in addition to its founding label. The company is headquartered in Tokyo, and is traded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, where it is a constituent of the Nikkei 225 and TOPIX Large70 indices.\n\n\n\n\n## Company History[edit]\n\n\n### Founding[edit]\n\n\nArinobu Fukuhara, former head pharmacist to the Imperial Japanese Navy, established the Shiseido Pharmacy in 1872. After a visit to the United States and Europe, Arinobu added a soda fountain to the store. This later grew into the Shiseido Parlor restaurant business, and eventually led to the introduction of ice cream in Japan. The name *Shiseido* derives from a Chinese expression meaning \"praise the virtues of the earth which nurtures new life and brings forth significant values\".[7][8][9]\n\n\nArinobu passed on his company to his son, Shinzo Fukuhara, who became the company's second president in 1913. After Shinzo's experience traveling to Europe and the United States, he became interested in advertising as a large selling point for Shiseido which lead him to dedicate extensive resources to the company's design, much of which can be seen from product packaging and magazines from this time.[10]\n\n\n\n### Expansion[edit]\n\n\nIn 1917, Shiseido introduced Rainbow Face Powder. This was a face powder with seven colors in a period when white face powders were the norm in Japan.[11] In 1923, the company began expanding its store-base; it now[*timeframe?*] has approximately 25,000 outlets. The company was incorporated as a *kabushiki gaisha* (Japanese joint-stock company) in 1927.[12] In 2017, Shiseido acquired AI and AR developer Giran to get ahead in the tech space. Shisheido plans to use Giaran\u2019s beauty simulation technology to boost its digital sales.[13][14]\n\n\n\n### Early 20th Century[edit]\n\n\nIn 1916, Shiseido transitioned from using historical images of Japanese female beauty to more Western ideals of beauty. The more contemporary images showed women with hair swept up rather than cascading back and incorporated trendy art nouveau style block scripts.[10] This shift in imagery coincided with increasing Western influence in Japan, allowing Shiseido to capitalize on this cultural change.[10]\n\n\nThe Ginza district burned during the Kanto Earthquake of 1923. This incident and the great depression in the 1930s, caused a decrease in sales of Shiseido. Shiseido partnered with stores to form the Shiseido Cosmetics Chain Store System. Therefore, consumers could rest assured that they could purchase Shiseido products at the same price at any store. In 1932, the representative Shiseido brand of top class cosmetic products of the time, De Luxe, was born. Following the outbreak of World War II, the De Luxe brand was considered an extravagance and production ceased.[15] However, it was re-launched in 1951, when the economy began to recover. Shiseido started to expand its cosmetics markets to the international market in the 1950s to 1980s.[16]\n\n\n\n### Reformation[edit]\n\n\nIn 2021, Shiseido sold its personal care business to a company held by British equity firm CVC Capital Partners, Shiseido also transferred all of its domestic personal care businesses to its Fine Today Shiseido subsidiary and was sold to CVC after the completion in July 2021.[17][18]\n\n\n\n### World War II[edit]\n\n\n#### Luxury ordinances[edit]\n\n\nA major concern in Japan during the Second World War was wasteful consumption of luxury products. This led to the imposition of luxury ordinances against goods explicitly tailored to luxury consumption. Due to these concerns, Shiseido emphasized the health benefits, high quality (leading to a maximizing of efficacy) and patriotic national production of their cosmetic products. Since Shiseido did not want to tarnish their deluxe brand image their designs and advertisements continued to incorporate highly stylized luxurious motifs. Despite an adherence to these motifs, Shiseido advertisements explicitly emphasized the utilitarian aspects of their products over their luxury, for instance toothpaste was endorsed for keeping teeth and gums healthy (rather than for making them beautifully white).[10]\n\n\n\n### Company magazines[edit]\n\n\nThe company began publishing company magazines in 1924, with *Shiseido Monthly (Shiseido Geppo*), which contained product advertisements and advice about cosmetics and fashion. *Shiseido Monthly* was replaced in 1933, with *The Shiseido Graph* (*Shiseido Gurafu*), and then renamed to *Hanatsubaki* in 1937.[19] *Shiseido Monthly* and *The Shiseido Graph* featured photographs by Shinzo Fukuhara, the company's second president and a well-known photographer.[10]\n\n\nShiseido's public relations magazines are aimed at \u201cinspiring a life of beauty and culture,\u201d following the company's stated corporate ideal.[19]\n\n\n\n## International expansion[edit]\n\n\nIn 1957, Shiseido began sales in Taiwan, closely followed by Singapore and Hong Kong. In 1962, Shiseido expanded to Hawaii; in 1965, it established Shiseido Cosmetics America. European sales began with Italy in 1968, Oceania with New Zealand in 1971 and former USSR in 1992 with Russia.[20]\n\n\nIn 1985, Shiseido was the first company to produce sodium hyaluronate (hyaluronic acid/hyaluronan) from non-animal origin sources.[21]\n\n\n\n## Finances and operations[edit]\n\n\nIn the first quarter of 2013, Shiseido made a profit of \u00a52.66 billion (US$26.87 million) on sales of \u00a5162.36bn (US$1.64bn).[22] On 15 July 2013, Shiseido announced it was opening a wholly owned subsidiary in India.[23] On 20 February 2014, Shiseido agreed to sell its Carita and Decl\u00e9or brands to L\u2019Or\u00e9al for \u20ac227.5M (US$312.93M). This sale resulted in Shiseido showing profits despite running into losses.[24]\n\n\nIn November 2023, Shiseido cut their profit forecast and suffered a 14% decline in stock price, the largest drop in a single day since October 2008. Shiseido cited dropping demand in the Chinese market after the Japanese government approved releasing radioactive wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi reactor into the Pacific Ocean. This decision drove Chinese customers to boycott or avoid Japanese cosmetics brands.[25]\n\n\n\n## Subsidiaries[edit]\n\n\nA partial list of Shiseido's wholly owned brands and subsidiaries, as well as exclusive licensing agreements.[26]\n\n\n\n### Prestige division[edit]\n\n\n* BAUM\n* BENEFIQUE\n* Cl\u00e9 de Peau Beaut\u00e9\n* Drunk Elephant\n* EFFECTIM\n* IPSA\n* ISSEY MIYAKE\n* NARS\n* narciso rodriguez\n* Serge Lutens\n* Shiseido\n* THE GINZA\n* Tory Burch\n* Ul\u00e9\n\n### Premium division[edit]\n\n\n* ANESSA\n* AQUA LABEL\n* AUPRES\n* d program\n* ELIXIR\n* GRACY\n* HAKU\n* INTEGRATE\n* MAJOLICA MAJORCA\n* MAQuillAGE\n* PRIOR\n* REVITAL\n* SIDEKICK\n* URARA\n\n### Inner Beauty division[edit]\n\n\n* INRYU\n* The Collagen\n\n### Life Quality Beauty division[edit]\n\n\n* Perfect Cover\n\n## Acquisitions[edit]\n\n\nOn January 18, 2017, Shiseido acquired Palo Alto, California-based, digital tech company MATCHCo, a startup described by co-founder and former professional skateboarder, Andy Howell, as \"AI for beauty.\"[27] The MATCHCo technology was rebranded by Shiseido as MADE-2-FIT, a bareMinerals iPhone app which offered \"precise skin tone analysis via a set of simple user scans, with the help of a virtual makeup artist with voice guidance.\"[27] To supplement MatchCo., Shiseido later acquired Giaran Inc., a data driven company, in November, 2017.[28]\n\n\nIn January 2018, the company acquired all of the assets of Olivo Laboratories.[29]\n\n\n\n## Make-up[edit]\n\n\nShiseido produces a line of cosmetics simply called \"The Makeup\" that provide a full range of products including: lip products, powder eye shadows, eye liner pencils, mascara, fluid and compact foundations, concealers, and powder blushes. Their hydro powder eye shadows which have a creamy texture are among *Allure* magazine's top beauty picks.[30]\n\n\nShiseido stepped into the world of cosmetics with the introduction of Eudermine in 1897, and established the Cosmetics Division and a store selling cosmetics in 1916. With the birth of new cosmetics, the\u00a0definition of makeup started to alter in the 1920s. The cosmetics were not used exclusively by women. Men started to use makeup to rebuild their image. Shiseido's scented hair tonics were among their most popular early cosmetics for both men and women, fueled by a reaction to Western distaste for less fragrant traditional hair oil products.[10] Shiseido also began to produce floral perfumes which contributed to the brand's \"De Luxe\" and \"rich\u201d aesthetic.[10]\n\n\nMeanwhile, modern beauty methods became a popular beauty topic in advertisements, newspaper columns and magazines in the late 1920s, to early 1930s. At that time, cosmetic consumers focused on the selection of the makeup and their uses. The single makeup method of painting the face white was considered outdated.[31] The beauty consumers liked to apply up to seven different colors of face powder including \u2018\u2019 white, yellow, flesh, rose, peony, green and purple\u2019\u2019 to match their skin tone.[32] In order to explore more potential consumers, Shiseido trained beauty advisers, who demonstrated and illustrated the uses of the cosmetics on the on-site demonstration briefing.\n\n\n\n## Animal testing[edit]\n\n\nIn 2017, Shiseido's subsidiary company, NARS Cosmetics, announced it was going to start testing their products on animals. In defense of its decision, the company stated \"We have decided to make NARS available in China because we feel it is important to bring our vision of beauty and artistry to fans in the region. Nars does not test on animals or ask others to do so on our behalf, except where required by law\".[33]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Weil, Jennifer (24 December 2013). \"Shiseido Names New President and CEO\".

With its subsidiaries, it develops, manufactures, markets, and distributes fragrances, cosmetics, skin care, nail care, and both professional and retail hair care products. Coty owns around 77 brands as of 2018.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## Corporate overview[edit]\n\n\nCoty is one of the world's largest beauty companies and the largest fragrance company,[4][5] with $5.3 billion in revenue for the fiscal year 2022.[6] Coty acquired 41 beauty brands from Procter & Gamble in 2016,[7] becoming the global leader in fragrance, the second largest company for hair color and styling products,[8] and the third largest company for color cosmetics.[9] The company operates three divisions: Consumer Beauty, which focuses on body care, color cosmetics, fragrances, and hair coloring and styling products; Luxury, for luxury cosmetic, fragrance, and skin care products; and Professional Beauty, which services beauty salon and nail salon professionals.[10][11] Coty's mission is to \"celebrate and liberate the diversity of beauty\".[12]\n\n\nThe company has approximately 20,000 full-time employees in 46 countries, as of mid 2018.[1] Coty's executive offices are located in London.[13] The Consumer Beauty, Luxury and Professional Beauty divisions are headquartered in New York City, Paris and Geneva, respectively.[1] Peter Harf is Coty's chairman.[14] Pierre Laubies was Coty's CEO,[14] but on June 1, 2020 he was replaced by Harf.[15] Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Terisse was appointed chief financial officer in January 2019.[16] In July 2020, it was announced that Sue Youcef Nabi will become the company's new chief executive officer. Nabi who has previously served as L'Or\u00e9al's executive, is slated to take over the position in September the same year.[17]\n\n\nJAB Holding Company is Coty's largest shareholder, with a 60 percent stake.[18]\n\n\n\n## Brands and products[edit]\n\n\nCoty owns approximately 77 brands, as of 2018 and has partnerships with various other brands, including:[19]\n\n\n\n* Adidas[20]\n* Alexander McQueen[21]\n* Balenciaga[22][23]\n* Bottega Veneta[24]\n* Bourjois[25]\n* Bruno Banani[21]\n* Burberry[26]\n* Calvin Klein\n* Chlo\u00e9[19]\n* Clairol[27]\n* David Beckham\n* Davidoff\n* Dolce & Gabbana\n* Escada[21]\n* Good Hair Day (ghd)[28]\n* Gucci\n* Hugo Boss[21]\n* James Bond (007 James Bond)[21]\n* Jil Sander[29]\n* JOOP!\n* Katy Perry\n* Kylie Cosmetics (51%)\n* KKW Beauty (20%)[30]\n* Lacoste (fragrances)[21]\n* Marc Jacobs[31]\n* Max Factor[31]\n* Mexx[21]\n* Miu Miu[32]\n* Nautica\n* OPI Products[33]\n* philosophy\n* Rimmel[33]\n* Roberto Cavalli[34]\n* Sally Hansen[35]\n* Stella McCartney[21]\n* Tiffany & Co[36]\n* Vera Wang\n* Wella[27]\n\nCoty relaunched the CoverGirl and Clairol brands, including the Nice 'n Easy hair coloring product, in late 2017 and early 2018, respectively. The relaunches included new messaging and product development, with an emphasis on diversity.[33][37][38] The company also relaunched Max Factor in 2018.[39][40][41]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### 1900s\u20131920s[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Fran\u00e7ois Coty in 1926\nCoty was founded by Fran\u00e7ois Coty in Paris in 1904.[1][2] The brand's first fragrance, La Rose Jacqueminot, was launched the same year and was packaged in a bottle designed by Baccarat.[42] L'Origan was launched in 1905; according to *The Week*, the perfume \"started a sweeping trend throughout Paris\" and was the first example of \"a fine but affordable fragrance that would appeal both to the upper classes and to the less affluent, changing the way scents were sold forever\".[43] Following its early successes, Coty was able to open its first store in 1908 in Paris' Place Vend\u00f4me.[42] Soon after, Coty began collaborating with French glass designer Ren\u00e9 Lalique to create custom fragrance bottles, labels, and other packaging materials, launching a new trend in mass-produced fragrance packaging.[44][45] Coty also established a \"Perfume City\" in the suburbs of Paris during the early 1910s to handle administration and fragrance production; the site was an early business supporter of female employees and offered benefits including child care.[42]\n\n\nThe company began its global expansion in the early 1910s, first in London and New York.[46][47] Coty established U.S. headquarters at 714 Fifth Avenue in New York City, and commissioned Lalique to design pressed glass panels for the building's fa\u00e7ade windows, which were installed in 1912.[44][48] Coty remained headquartered in the building until 1941.[48] The structure was later given landmark status by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission during the 1980s for its custom windows.[49][50]\nCoty began selling other beauty products including face and body powders in the 1910s, and launched one of its most successful fragrances, Chypre, in 1917. The company's products gained more attention in the United States as World War I soldiers started returning from France with gifts for loved ones. During the 1920s, Coty launched more than fifteen new fragrances and expanded into Germany, Italy, Spain, and Switzerland.[44] Coty, Inc. was formed in New York in 1922, and became a publicly-traded company in 1925.[51]\n\n\n\n### 1930s\u20131990s[edit]\n\n\nFran\u00e7ois Coty died in 1934; his family maintained control of the company and served as board members until the 1960s.[44]\n\n\n\n![](image)Coty Pavillion at the 1939 New York World's Fair.\nCoty's Air Spun face powder was launched in 1935.[42] The powder has been described by *Real Simple* as one of the \"best beauty products of all time\" and remains mostly unchanged.[52]\n\n\nIn the 1940s, Coty became a major supporter of the growing American fashion industry, launching the Coty American Fashion Critics' Awards to recognize and promote emerging American fashion designers. Coty discontinued its participation in 1985.[53][54]\n\n\nCoty became a key player in the American lipstick market with the launch of Coty 24 in 1955. By the 1960s, Coty had become a leading fragrance manufacturer and marketer and the largest fragrance company in the U.S.[44] It attracted the attention of Pfizer, which acquired the company in 1963.[2][44]\n\n\nIn 1991, the company had annual sales of approximately $280 million.[55][56] Pfizer sold Coty to Joh. A. Benckiser (now known as JAB Holding Company) in 1992. Coty was a strategic fit for Benckiser, which had another beauty subsidiary, as well as an international distribution network through which it could market Coty's products.[55] Coty's fragrances at the time included Emeraude, Exclamation, L'Effleur, Preferred Stock, Sand & Sable, Tribe, and Wild Musk.[55][57] Peter Harf, chairman and CEO of JAB since 1988, was named Coty's CEO in 1993.[44] Coty acquired Unilever's European cosmetic brands, including Rimmel, in 1996.[44]\n\n\n\n### 2000s[edit]\n\n\nDuring the mid 2000s, the company focused on marketing celebrity-endorsed fragrances, including David Beckham, C\u00e9line Dion, Jennifer Lopez, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Shania Twain.[58] Coty also expanded its portfolio of luxury fragrances. It purchased the fragrance license for fashion designer Marc Jacobs in 2003.[59] The company's revenue increased from $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion during 2004\u20132005.[58][60]\n\n\nIn 2005, Coty purchased additional licenses for Calvin Klein, Cerruti, Chlo\u00e9, Lagerfeld, and Vera Wang from Unilever.[61] These newest acquisitions, along with existing portfolio licenses including Adidas, Davidoff, and JOOP!,[62][63] made Coty the largest global fragrance maker.[2][60]\n\n\nCoty acquired Del Laboratories' parent company, DLI Holding Corp., in 2007, adding the Sally Hansen and NYC New York Color brands to Coty's portfolio.[64][65] The company entered into license agreements with Balenciaga in 2008 and Bottega Veneta in 2009.[22][66][67]\n\n\n\n### 2010s[edit]\n\n\nIn 2010, Coty purchased nail polish maker OPI Products,[68] as well as the skin care brand philosophy from The Carlyle Group.[59][69] The company also entered into a license agreement with Miu Miu, a subsidiary of Prada.[32]\n\n\nCoty filed to go public in June 2012, and raised approximately $1 billion during its initial public offering (IPO) one year later.[70][71] The IPO, held in 2013, was the third largest in the US at the time and the largest by a final goods company since Michael Kors.[70] CNN Money described the offering as the \"largest U.S.-listed IPO for a consumer products company\".[71] Coty acquired Bourjois in 2014.[72]\n\n\nDuring 2015\u20132016, Coty acquired 41 beauty brands from Procter & Gamble (collectively known as Galleria),[7] including Clairol, CoverGirl, Gucci, Hugo Boss, Lacoste, Max Factor, and Wella.[27][31][26] The agreement, completed as a Reverse Morris Trust, made Coty the third largest global seller of cosmetics.[9][33][73] Coty also acquired the digital marketing technology agency Beamly in 2015.[74][75][76]\n\n\nThe company entered into a license agreement with Tiffany & Co. in 2016.[77] During 2016\u20132017, Coty acquired Hypermarcas' (now known as Hypera Pharma) beauty and personal care business, ghd, and became a majority stakeholder in the peer to peer digital beauty company Younique.[78] Younique had approximately 80,000 sellers when Coty purchased a 60 percent stake in January 2017, and surpassed 230,000 sellers by December.[79] Coty announced that it was cutting ties with Younique in August 2019, saying that Younique was \"definitely different\" from other businesses owned by Coty, and intended to sell its 60% stake in Younique back to its founders.[80]\n\n\nCoty acquired licenses to Burberry's cosmetics and fragrance brands in April 2017.[81] In July, Coty added the skincare brand philosophy to Tmall,[82] and launched other brands on the platform as well.[41][83]\n\n\nIn December 2017, the Court of Justice of the European Union's European Court of Justice ruled that Coty did not violate competition laws by forbidding German distributor Parf\u00fcmerie Akzente from selling products via Amazon, and that luxury brands are allowed to prohibit distributors from selling through third-party platforms.[19][84][85] Previously, according to the United States House Committee on the Judiciary, Coty supported the Stop Online Piracy Act, a bill introduced to expand the ability of U.S. law enforcement to combat copyright infringement and counterfeit goods trafficking, in late 2011.[86][87]\n\n\nCoty developed \"Let's Get Ready\" for the Amazon Echo Show; the guide debuted in early 2018 and presents looks and products to users, which can be added to shopping carts.[88] In February, Coty created a startup accelerator focused on artificial intelligence.[89][90]\n\n\nThe company underwent refinancing of debt, including debt associated with Galleria, in March 2018.[7]\n\n\nIn November 2019, Coty announced to purchase a $600 million stake (51%) in Kylie Cosmetics, the company of media personality and model Kylie Jenner.[91][92] In June 2020, the company announced that it would buy a 20% stake for $200 million in KKW, a company owned by Jenner's sister Kim Kardashian West.[30]\n\n\nOn December 1, 2020, Coty completed sale of Wella, Clairol, OPI and ghd brands stake to KKR for $2.5bn in cash whilst retaining 40% stake in the standalone company.[93] On October 1, 2021, Coty announced that it would sell an approximate 9% stake in Wella to KKR for $426.5 million. The deal cuts Coty's stake in Wella, Clairol, OPI and ghd brands to around 30.6%.[94]\n\n\n\n## Environmental practices and social causes[edit]\n\n\nCoty and its brands say they are committed to a range of social causes as well as seeking to minimize its environmental impact. The company has entered into a long-term partnership with the international advocacy group Global Citizen to tackle prejudice and discrimination based on gender, sexual orientation, disability, or ethnicity, and to promote self-expression.[95] Coty has also joined other beauty companies to launch the Responsible Beauty Initiative to encourage sustainability within the industry.[96] Coty has signed the United Nations Global Compact, a UN initiative to encourage businesses to adopt sustainable and socially responsible policies.\n\n\n\n## Rankings[edit]\n\n\nCoty ranked number 371 on the Fortune 500, *Fortune* magazine's annual list of the largest U.S. corporations by total revenue, in 2018.[97] The company ranked number 5 on *Women's Wear Daily*'s 2017 \"Top 100\" list of the world's largest beauty manufacturers, estimating $9.15 billion in sales.[98] According to *Advertising Age*, Coty was one of the largest global advertisers in 2017.[99] In 2018, Coty ranked number 1,196 on the *Forbes* Global 2000, an annual ranking of the top 2,000 public companies in the world.[100] Additionally, Coty ranked number 396 on *Forbes's* 2018 list of \"America's Largest Public Companies\".[100]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange (C)\n* List of organizations with official stances on the SOPA and PIPA\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** \"Form 10-K: Coty Inc\".
