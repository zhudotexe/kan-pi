R. Rahman won the Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing and Best Original Score, respectively, for the 2008 British film *Slumdog Millionaire*. Rahman also won for Best Original Song alongside lyricist Gulzar for the song \"Jai Ho\",[9] becoming the first Indian to date to have won more than one Academy Award. Rahman also holds the record for most nominations for an Indian with five total nominations to date, followed by Ismail Merchant with four nominations (three for Best Picture and once for Live Action Short). \n\n\nAt the 95th Academy Awards, three different Indian productions received Oscar nominations, with both *RRR* (feature film) and *The Elephant Whisperers (Documentary short film)* winning their respective categories and thus becoming the first Indian full length feature film and first Indian Documentary short film to win the Oscars.[10] Several Indians and Indian Americans have received the Oscars in the technical category like Rahul Thakkar, Cottalango Leon and Vikas Sathaye.\n\n\n\n\n## Honorary awards[edit]\n\n\n![A portrait of Satyajit Ray.](image)India's Oscar Honorary Academy Award recipient (in 1992) director Satyajit Ray (Born in Kolkata, Bengal, now West Bengal, into a Bengali Hindu Kayastha family of Mymensingh, Bengal, now Bangladesh).\n\n\nHonorary awards\n| Year\n | Recipient\n | Note\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1992(64th) | Satyajit Ray | \"In recognition of his rare mastery of the art of motion pictures, and of his profound humanitarian outlook, which has had an indelible influence on filmmakers and audiences throughout the world.\"\n | [11][12] |\n\n\n## Competitive Awards[edit]\n\n\n\n\nCompetitive awards\n| Year\n | Nominee(s)/recipient(s)\n | Film\n | Category\n | Result\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1958(30th) | *Mother India* | *Mother India* | Best Foreign Language Film | Nominated\n | [2] |\n| 1961(33rd) | Ismail Merchant | *The Creation of Woman* | Best Short Subject (Live Action) | Nominated\n | [13] |\n| 1969(41st) | Fali Bilimoria | *The House That Ananda Built* | Best Documentary (Short Subject) | Nominated\n |  |\n| 1978(50th) | Ishu Patel | *Bead Game* | Best Animated Short Film | Nominated\n | [14] |\n| 1979(51st) | K.

The film made it to the final shortlist and was nominated alongside four other films in the category.[8] It came close to winning the Academy Award but lost to *Nights of Cabiria* by a single vote.[9] Since 1984, India has not submitted a film on only one occasion; in 2003, the FFI controversially chose not make an entry as they felt no film would be in a position to compete with films from other nations.[10][11] As of 2021[update], only three Indian films—*Mother India* (1957), *Salaam Bombay!* (1988) and *Lagaan* (2001)—have been nominated for the award.[12] In 2011, the jury of the 58th National Film Awards made a recommendation that the Best Film winners at the annual National Film Awards be chosen as the official entry.[6][13]\n\n\n\n\n## Submissions[edit]\n\n\nAs of 2023, India has sent a total of 56 films to the competition. 34 of the which were Hindi films (including five Hindustani films, one Urdu film and one Hindi-Tamil bilingual film), three of which received nominations. Ten Tamil films (including one Hindi-Tamil bilingual film), four Malayalam films, three Marathi films, two of each Bengali and Gujarati films and one film of each Assamese and Telugu languages have been submitted.\n\n\nBengali filmmaker Satyajit Ray has represented India three times in this competition, the most by any director. As actors Kamal Haasan and Raghubir Yadav have been part of seven films submitted for the consideration—more than any other performer.[14][15] One of Haasan's directorial effort was also submitted.[16] Aamir Khan has represented India four times as an actor, including once as a director and thrice as a producer; *Lagaan* (2001), which he produced and starred in, received a nomination.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year(Ceremony) | Film title used in nomination | Original title | Language | Director(s) | Result\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1957(30th) | *Mother India* | *Mother India (मदर इंडिया)* | Hindustani[17] | Mehboob Khan | Nominated[b] |\n| 1958(31st) | *Madhumati* | *Madhumati (मधुमती)* | Hindustani[17] | Bimal Roy | Not nominated\n |\n| 1959(32nd) | *The World of Apu* | *Apur Sansar (অপুর সংসার)* | Bengali | Satyajit Ray | Not nominated\n |\n| 1962(35th) | *Sahib Bibi Aur Ghulam* | *Sahib Bibi Aur Ghulam (साहिब बीबी और ग़ुलाम)* | Hindustani\n | Abrar Alvi | Not nominated\n |\n| 1963(36th) | *Metropolis* | *Mahanagar (মহানগর)* | Bengali\n | Satyajit Ray | Not nominated\n |\n| 1965(38th) | *The Guide* | *Guide (गाइड)* | Hindi | Vijay Anand | Not nominated\n |\n| 1966(39th) | *Amrapali* | *Amrapali (आम्रपाली)* | Hindi\n | Lekh Tandon | Not nominated\n |\n| 1967(40th) | *The Last Letter* | *Aakhri Khat (आख़री ख़त)* | Hindi\n | Chetan Anand | Not nominated\n |\n| 1968(41st) | *Elder Sister* | *Majhli Didi (मझली दीदी)* | Hindi\n | Hrishikesh Mukherjee | Not nominated\n |\n| 1969(42nd) | *Deiva Magan* | *Deiva Magan (தெய்வ மகன்)* | Tamil | A.

The film made it to the final shortlist and was nominated alongside four other films in the category.[8] It came close to winning the Academy Award but lost to *Nights of Cabiria* by a single vote.[9] Since 1984, India has not submitted a film on only one occasion; in 2003, the FFI controversially chose not make an entry as they felt no film would be in a position to compete with films from other nations.[10][11] As of 2021[update], only three Indian films—*Mother India* (1957), *Salaam Bombay!* (1988) and *Lagaan* (2001)—have been nominated for the award.[12] In 2011, the jury of the 58th National Film Awards made a recommendation that the Best Film winners at the annual National Film Awards be chosen as the official entry.[6][13]\n\n\n\n\n## Submissions[edit]\n\n\nAs of 2023, India has sent a total of 56 films to the competition. 34 of the which were Hindi films (including five Hindustani films, one Urdu film and one Hindi-Tamil bilingual film), three of which received nominations. Ten Tamil films (including one Hindi-Tamil bilingual film), four Malayalam films, three Marathi films, two of each Bengali and Gujarati films and one film of each Assamese and Telugu languages have been submitted.\n\n\nBengali filmmaker Satyajit Ray has represented India three times in this competition, the most by any director. As actors Kamal Haasan and Raghubir Yadav have been part of seven films submitted for the consideration—more than any other performer.[14][15] One of Haasan's directorial effort was also submitted.[16] Aamir Khan has represented India four times as an actor, including once as a director and thrice as a producer; *Lagaan* (2001), which he produced and starred in, received a nomination.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year(Ceremony) | Film title used in nomination | Original title | Language | Director(s) | Result\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1957(30th) | *Mother India* | *Mother India (मदर इंडिया)* | Hindustani[17] | Mehboob Khan | Nominated[b] |\n| 1958(31st) | *Madhumati* | *Madhumati (मधुमती)* | Hindustani[17] | Bimal Roy | Not nominated\n |\n| 1959(32nd) | *The World of Apu* | *Apur Sansar (অপুর সংসার)* | Bengali | Satyajit Ray | Not nominated\n |\n| 1962(35th) | *Sahib Bibi Aur Ghulam* | *Sahib Bibi Aur Ghulam (साहिब बीबी और ग़ुलाम)* | Hindustani\n | Abrar Alvi | Not nominated\n |\n| 1963(36th) | *Metropolis* | *Mahanagar (মহানগর)* | Bengali\n | Satyajit Ray | Not nominated\n |\n| 1965(38th) | *The Guide* | *Guide (गाइड)* | Hindi | Vijay Anand | Not nominated\n |\n| 1966(39th) | *Amrapali* | *Amrapali (आम्रपाली)* | Hindi\n | Lekh Tandon | Not nominated\n |\n| 1967(40th) | *The Last Letter* | *Aakhri Khat (आख़री ख़त)* | Hindi\n | Chetan Anand | Not nominated\n |\n| 1968(41st) | *Elder Sister* | *Majhli Didi (मझली दीदी)* | Hindi\n | Hrishikesh Mukherjee | Not nominated\n |\n| 1969(42nd) | *Deiva Magan* | *Deiva Magan (தெய்வ மகன்)* | Tamil | A.
