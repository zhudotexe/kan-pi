She also reached No. 15 with \"Shake It Off\" and No. 69 with \"It's Like That\" featuring Jermaine Dupri and Fatman Scoop.\nThe *Billboard* Hot 100 is a chart that ranks the best-performing singles of the United States. Its data, published by *Billboard* magazine and compiled by Nielsen SoundScan, is based collectively on each single's weekly physical and digital sales, as well as airplay and streaming. At the end of a year, *Billboard* will publish an annual list of the 100 most successful songs throughout that year on the Hot 100 chart based on the information. For 2005, the list was published on December 20, calculated with data from December 4, 2004, to November 26, 2005.[1] The R&B track \"We Belong Together\" by American singer Mariah Carey was named the number 1 song of 2005 and it spent the longest time at number 1 for the year, 14 weeks. This is also the third-longest time at number 1 for a single in the 57-year history of the Hot 100 post-1958 inception, after Mariah Carey's own collaboration with Boyz II Men, \"One Sweet Day\", which spent 16 weeks atop the Hot 100 from 1995 to 1996, and \"Despacito\" by Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee, featuring Justin Bieber, which equaled that mark in 2017, both being beaten in 2019 by \"Old Town Road\" by Lil Nas X and Billy Ray Cyrus, which had 19 weeks at No. 1.\n\n\n\n## List[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rapper 50 Cent had six songs on the chart, five of them in the top 40, the highest one being \"Candy Shop\" at number eight.\n![](image)Singer Ciara had four songs in the top 40 of the chart, the highest one being \"1, 2 Step\" at number five.\n![](image)The Black Eyed Peas had three

The song was written by Ne-Yo, Kameron Houff, and Scott Storch, while the production was handled by Storch. The song garnered Mario a Grammy Award nomination for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance in 2006 and became a top-10 hit worldwide, reaching number one in the United States, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, and New Zealand.\n\n\nIn 2008, \"Let Me Love You\" was ranked at number 45 on *Billboard*'s All-Time Top 100 Hot 100 singles during the first 50 years of the chart.[2] It was the eighth most successful single of the decade according to the *Billboard* Hot 100 Songs of the Decade chart released in December 2009.[3] In 2013, it was ranked at number 53 on *Billboard*'s All-Time Top 100 Hot 100 singles during the first 55 years of the chart.[4] The remix of the song, also produced by Storch, contains rapped verses from Jadakiss and T.I.\n\n\n\n\n## Background and composition[edit]\n\n\nThe song was written by Kameron Houff, Ne-Yo, and Scott Storch, who also produced the track.[5] According to Ne-Yo, after he chose to start singing his songs, he regretted giving \"Let Me Love You\" to Mario and said that he would have kept it for himself.[6] \"Let Me Love You\" is a moderate R&B ballad in G minor, centered around the progression C minor / G minor / F major. It is written in common time.[7]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Critical reception[edit]\n\n\nJon Pareles from *The New York Times* commented that \"Let Me Love You\" \"looks back to another 1980s blockbuster, lifting its keyboard sound from Tina Turner's 'What's Love Got to Do with It'.\"[8]\n\n\n\n### Accolades and nominations[edit]\n\n\nIn 2004, \"Let Me Love You\" was nominated for a Vibe Award for Best R&B Song and two Teen Choice Awards, Choice Love Song and Choice R&B/Rap Track, but it failed to receive any awards. In 2005, it received nominations for *Billboard* Music Awards, including \"Hot 100 Single of the Year\", \"Hot 100 Airplay Single of the Year\", \"Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Single of the Year\", \"Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay Single of the Year, winning in both the R&B categories. It was also nominated for an MTV Europe Music Award for Best R&B Single, a Viewer's Choice award at the BET Awards, Best Single at the MOBO Awards, and Best R&B/Soul Song at the Soul Train Music Awards. In 2006, Mario was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance with \"Let Me Love You\". He also received an MTV Australia Awards nomination for Best R&B music video for \"Let Me Love You\".[9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16]\n\n\n\n## Commercial performance[edit]\n\n\n\"Let Me Love You\" debuted on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 the week of October 23, 2004, at number 97. The song went on to hold the number-one position on the U.S. *Billboard* Hot 100 chart for nine consecutive weeks from January to February 2005, and, as of 2024, is Mario's biggest single. It also reached number one on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. Internationally, it reached the number-one position on the singles charts in Germany, the Netherlands, and New Zealand. In the United Kingdom, the song reached number two on the UK Singles Chart (held off the top spot by \"(Is This the Way to) Amarillo\"), making it Mario's biggest hit to date in the UK. The single also holds the honor of being one of the highest-selling ringtones with 1.6\u00a0million downloads.[17]\n\n\n\n## Music video[edit]\n\n\nThe music video was filmed at studios in Brooklyn, New York in September 2004, directed by Little X. The video generally features Mario dancing, alone or with backup dancers, on various sets.\n\n\n\n## Track listings[edit]\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **US 7-inch single**[18]\n\nA. \"Let Me Love
