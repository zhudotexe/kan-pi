The data is differentiated by gender, presenting life expectancies for males, females, and a combined average. In addition to sovereign nations, the list encompasses several non-sovereign entities and territories. The figures serve as an indicator of the quality of healthcare in the respective countries and are influenced by various factors, including the prevalence of diseases such as HIV/AIDS. This article introduces the concept of Healthy life expectancy (HALE), which denotes the average number of years a person is expected to live in \"full health\". There are challenges in comparing life expectancies across countries due to disparities in data reporting and collection standards. The primary source of the most recent data presented is the World Bank Group's 2021 report.\n\n\n\n\n## Methodology[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nLife expectancy in world, according to estimation of the World Bank Group, 2019–2021\n\n## United Nations (2021)[edit]\n\n\nShown is the \"period life expectancy\" at birth. This is the average number of years a newborn would live if age-specific mortality rates in the current year were to stay the same throughout its life. The data is taken from the 2020 and 2022 United Nations World Population Prospects.[6][7] It is also used to calculate the Human Development Index. Only countries with populations over 50,000 are listed. Due to this criterion, the table does not include Monaco (LE 85.9 years, population 39,000). By default, the list is sorted by 2021. Data for 2021 can also be viewed via Our World in Data.[8]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe life expectancy is shown separately for males and for females, as well as a combined figure. Several non-sovereign entities and territories are also included in this list.\n\n\nThe figures reflect the quality of healthcare in the countries listed as well as other factors including HIV infections.\n\n\nFrom the beginning of the current century there is a tendency to also estimate **Healthy life expectancy** (HALE) — the average number of years that a person can expect to live in \"full health\".[1][2]\n\n\nComparing life expectancies across countries can be problematic. For example, due to poor reporting in some countries and various local standards in collecting statistics. This is especially true for Healthy life expectancy, the definition of which criteria may change over time, even within a country.\n\n\n\n## World Bank Group (2021)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Countries\n | Life expectancy at birth\n | HALE at birth\n | Life expectancy at age 60\n | HALE at age 60\n |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| All\n | M | F | FΔM | Δ2000 | All\n | M\n | F\n | FΔM\n | Δ2000\n | All\n | M\n | F\n | FΔM\n | Δ2000\n | All\n | M\n | F\n | FΔM\n | Δ2000\n |\n| ![](image) Japan | 84.3 | 81.5 | 86.9 | 5.4 | 3.2 | 74.1 | 72.6 | 75.5 | 2.9 | 2.5 | 26.3 | 23.9 | 28.6 | 4.7 | 2.2 | 20.4 | 18.8 | 21.8 | 3.0 | 1.7 | ![Japan](image) |\n| ![](image) Switzerland | 83.4 | 81.8 | 85.1 | 3.3 | 3.7 | 72.5 | 72.2 | 72.8 | 0.6 | 3.2 | 25.4 | 24.1 | 26.6 | 2.5 | 2.4 | 19.5 | 18.8 | 20.2 | 1.4 | 1.8 | ![Switzerland](image) |\n| ![](image) South Korea | 83.3 | 80.3 | 86.1 | 5.8 | 7.1 | 73.1 | 71.3 | 74.7 | 3.4 | 5.7 | 25.8 | 23.4 | 27.9 | 4.5 | 5.1 | 19.8 | 18.2 | 21.2 | 3.0 | 3.9 | ![South Korea](image) |\n| ![](image) Singapore | 83.2 | 81.0 | 85.5 | 4.5 | 4.8 | 73.6 | 72.4 | 74.7 | 2.3 | 4.1 | 25.5 | 23.8 | 27.2 | 3.4 | 4.0 | 20.0 | 18.8 | 21.0 | 2.2 | 3.4 | ![Singapore](image) |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| ![](image) Mozambique | 57.10 | 55.76 | 58.49\n | 2.73\n |\n| ![](image) Somalia | 55.72 | 53.39 | 58.12\n | 4.73\n |\n| ![](image) Central African Republic | 55.52 | 54.19 | 56.88\n | 2.69\n |\n| ![](image) Afghanistan | 53.65 | 52.10 | 54.28\n | 2.18\n |\n|  World (2020) | 70.50 | 68.40 | 72.60\n | 4.20\n |\n| *![](image) European Union (2021)* | 77.63 | 72.98 | 82.51\n | 9.53\n |\n\n\n## Gallery[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Comparison of average female and male life expectancy as defined by WHO for 2019.

The data is differentiated by gender, presenting life expectancies for males, females, and a combined average. In addition to sovereign nations, the list encompasses several non-sovereign entities and territories. The figures serve as an indicator of the quality of healthcare in the respective countries and are influenced by various factors, including the prevalence of diseases such as HIV/AIDS. This article introduces the concept of Healthy life expectancy (HALE), which denotes the average number of years a person is expected to live in \"full health\". There are challenges in comparing life expectancies across countries due to disparities in data reporting and collection standards. The primary source of the most recent data presented is the World Bank Group's 2021 report.\n\n\n\n\n## Methodology[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nLife expectancy in world, according to estimation of the World Bank Group, 2019–2021\n\n## United Nations (2021)[edit]\n\n\nShown is the \"period life expectancy\" at birth. This is the average number of years a newborn would live if age-specific mortality rates in the current year were to stay the same throughout its life. The data is taken from the 2020 and 2022 United Nations World Population Prospects.[6][7] It is also used to calculate the Human Development Index. Only countries with populations over 50,000 are listed. Due to this criterion, the table does not include Monaco (LE 85.9 years, population 39,000). By default, the list is sorted by 2021. Data for 2021 can also be viewed via Our World in Data.[8]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe life expectancy is shown separately for males and for females, as well as a combined figure. Several non-sovereign entities and territories are also included in this list.\n\n\nThe figures reflect the quality of healthcare in the countries listed as well as other factors including HIV infections.\n\n\nFrom the beginning of the current century there is a tendency to also estimate **Healthy life expectancy** (HALE) — the average number of years that a person can expect to live in \"full health\".[1][2]\n\n\nComparing life expectancies across countries can be problematic. For example, due to poor reporting in some countries and various local standards in collecting statistics. This is especially true for Healthy life expectancy, the definition of which criteria may change over time, even within a country.\n\n\n\n## World Bank Group (2021)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Countries\n | Life expectancy at birth\n | HALE at birth\n | Life expectancy at age 60\n | HALE at age 60\n |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| All\n | M | F | FΔM | Δ2000 | All\n | M\n | F\n | FΔM\n | Δ2000\n | All\n | M\n | F\n | FΔM\n | Δ2000\n | All\n | M\n | F\n | FΔM\n | Δ2000\n |\n| ![](image) Japan | 84.3 | 81.5 | 86.9 | 5.4 | 3.2 | 74.1 | 72.6 | 75.5 | 2.9 | 2.5 | 26.3 | 23.9 | 28.6 | 4.7 | 2.2 | 20.4 | 18.8 | 21.8 | 3.0 | 1.7 | ![Japan](image) |\n| ![](image) Switzerland | 83.4 | 81.8 | 85.1 | 3.3 | 3.7 | 72.5 | 72.2 | 72.8 | 0.6 | 3.2 | 25.4 | 24.1 | 26.6 | 2.5 | 2.4 | 19.5 | 18.8 | 20.2 | 1.4 | 1.8 | ![Switzerland](image) |\n| ![](image) South Korea | 83.3 | 80.3 | 86.1 | 5.8 | 7.1 | 73.1 | 71.3 | 74.7 | 3.4 | 5.7 | 25.8 | 23.4 | 27.9 | 4.5 | 5.1 | 19.8 | 18.2 | 21.2 | 3.0 | 3.9 | ![South Korea](image) |\n| ![](image) Singapore | 83.2 | 81.0 | 85.5 | 4.5 | 4.8 | 73.6 | 72.4 | 74.7 | 2.3 | 4.1 | 25.5 | 23.8 | 27.2 | 3.4 | 4.0 | 20.0 | 18.8 | 21.0 | 2.2 | 3.4 | ![Singapore](image) |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| ![](image) Mozambique | 57.10 | 55.76 | 58.49\n | 2.73\n |\n| ![](image) Somalia | 55.72 | 53.39 | 58.12\n | 4.73\n |\n| ![](image) Central African Republic | 55.52 | 54.19 | 56.88\n | 2.69\n |\n| ![](image) Afghanistan | 53.65 | 52.10 | 54.28\n | 2.18\n |\n|  World (2020) | 70.50 | 68.40 | 72.60\n | 4.20\n |\n| *![](image) European Union (2021)* | 77.63 | 72.98 | 82.51\n | 9.53\n |\n\n\n## Gallery[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Comparison of average female and male life expectancy as defined by WHO for 2019.

Unless otherwise stated, it represents estimates of the life expectancies of the world population as a whole. In many instances, life expectancy varied considerably according to class and gender.\n\n\nLife expectancy at birth takes account of infant mortality and child mortality but not prenatal mortality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Life expectancy in 1800, 1950, and 2015 – visualization by Our World in Data\nHuman beings are expected to live on average 30–40 years in Eswatini[57] and 82.6 years in Japan.[b] An analysis published in 2011 in *The Lancet* attributes Japanese life expectancy to equal opportunities, public health, and diet.[59][60]\n\n\n\n![](image)Plot of life expectancy vs. GDP per capita in 2009.

If a large amount of data is available, a statistical population can be created that allow the age-specific death rates to be simply taken as the mortality rates actually experienced at each age (the number of deaths divided by the number of years \"exposed to risk\" in each data cell). However, it is customary to apply smoothing to remove (as much as possible) the random statistical fluctuations from one year of age to the next. In the past, a very simple model used for this purpose was the Gompertz function, but more sophisticated methods are now used.[147] The most common modern methods include:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Life expectancy is higher in rich countries with low economic inequality.[70]\n![](image)Life expectancy vs healthcare spending of rich OECD countries. US average of $10,447 in 2018.[71]\nEconomic circumstances also affect life expectancy. For example, in the United Kingdom, life expectancy in the wealthiest and richest areas is several years higher than in the poorest areas. This may reflect factors such as diet and lifestyle, as well as access to medical care. It may also reflect a selective effect: people with chronic life-threatening illnesses are less likely to become wealthy or to reside in affluent areas.[72] In Glasgow, the disparity is amongst the highest in the world: life expectancy for males in the heavily deprived Calton area stands at 54, which is 28 years less than in the affluent area of Lenzie, which is only 8 km (5.0 mi) away.[73][74]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![Healthy Life Expectancy (HALE) vs GDP per Capita in different countries](image)Healthy Life Expectancy (HALE) vs GDP per Capita in different countries\nThe long-standing quest for longer life led in the 2010s to a more promising focus on increasing HALE, also known as a person's \"healthspan\". Besides the benefits of keeping people healthier longer, a goal is to reduce health-care expenses on the many diseases associated with cellular senescence. Approaches being explored include fasting, exercise, and senolytic drugs.[152]\n\n\n\n## Forecasting[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n61. **^** \"Life expectancy at birth, total (years)—Data\".\n62. **^** \"\"World Population Prospects—The 2002 Revision\", 2003, page 24\".\n63. **^** \"GHO—By category—Life expectancy—Data by country\".\n64. **^** \"Wealth & Health of Nations\".

For example, white Americans in 2010 are expected to live until age 78.9, but black Americans only until age 75.1. This 3.8-year gap, however, is the lowest it has been since 1975 at the latest. The greatest difference was 7.1 years in 1993.[66] In contrast, Asian-American women live the longest of all ethnic groups in the United States, with a life expectancy of 85.8 years.[67] The life expectancy of Hispanic-Americans is 81.2 years.[66] According to the new government reports in the US, life expectancy in the country dropped again because of the rise in suicide and drug overdose rates. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) found nearly 70,000 more Americans died in 2017 than in 2016, with rising rates of death among 25- to 44-year-olds.[68]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLife expectancy can also create popular misconceptions about at what age a certain population may expect to die at. The modal age at death is the age when most deaths occur in a population, and is sometimes used instead of life expectancy for this kind of understanding. For example, in the table above, life expectancy in the Paleolithic is listed as 22–33 years. For many, this implies that most people in the Paleolithic died in their late twenties. However, in the Paleolithic, most adults in the Paleolithic died at *72 years* (the average modal adult life span).[161]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Biodemography\n* Calorie restriction\n* Demography\n* Depreciation\n* DNA damage theory of aging\n* Glasgow effect\n* Health equity\n* Life extension\n* Life table\n* Lindy effect\n* List of countries by life expectancy\n* List of countries by past life expectancy\n* List of longest-living organisms\n* LGBT life expectancy\n* Maximum life span\n* Medieval demography\n* Mitohormesis\n* Mortality rate\n* Population pyramid\n* Senescence\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n41. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** ***k*** ***l*** ***m*** ***n*** ***o*** Roser, Max; Ortiz-Ospina, Esteban; Ritchie, Hannah (2019) [First published in 2013]. \"Life Expectancy\". *Our World in Data*.

For instance, in a society with a life expectancy of 30, it may nevertheless be common to have a 40-year remaining timespan at age 5 (but perhaps not a 60-year one).\n\n\nUntil the middle of the 20th century, infant mortality was approximately 40–60% of the total mortality. Excluding child mortality, the average life expectancy during the 12th–19th centuries was approximately 55 years. If a person survived childhood, they had about a 50% chance of living 50–55 years, instead of only 25–40 years.[5] As of 2016, the overall worldwide life expectancy had reached the highest level that has been measured in modern times.[6]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"\"Life Expectancy\" – What does this actually mean?\". *Our World in Data*.

This confusion may create the expectation that an adult would be unlikely to exceed an life expectancy, even though, with all statistical probability, an adult, who has already avoided many statistical causes of adolescent mortality, should be expected to outlive the life expectancy calculated from birth.[157] One must compare the life expectancy of the period after childhood to estimate also the life expectancy of an adult.[157]\n\n\n  \n\nLife expectancy can change dramatically after childhood. In the table above, note the life expectancy *at birth* in the Paleolithic is 22–33 years, but life expectancy at 15 is 54 years. Additional studies similarly show a dramatic increase in life expectancy once adulthood was reached.[158][159]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLife expectancy is one of the factors in measuring the Human Development Index (HDI) of each nation along with adult literacy, education, and standard of living.[154]\n\n\nLife expectancy is used in describing the physical quality of life of an area. It is also used for an individual when the value of a life settlement is determined a life insurance policy is sold for a cash asset.[*clarification needed*]\n\n\nDisparities in life expectancy are often cited as demonstrating the need for better medical care or increased social support. A strongly associated indirect measure is income inequality. For the top 21 industrialized countries, if each person is counted equally, life expectancy is lower in more unequal countries (r = −0.907).[155] There is a similar relationship among states in the U.S. (r = −0.620).[156]\n\n\n\n## Life expectancy vs. other measures of longevity[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n147. **^** Anderson, Robert N.

Life expectancy was probably slightly longer for women than men.[31]\nWhen infant mortality is factored out (i.e. counting only the 67[27]–75% who survived the first year), life expectancy is around 34–41 more years (i.e. expected to live to 35–42). When child mortality is factored out (i.e. counting only the 55-65% who survived to age 5), life expectancy is around 40–45 (i.e. age 45–50).[29] The ~50% that reached age 10 could also expect to reach ~45-50;[27] at 15 to ~48–54; at 40 to ~60;[27] at 50 to ~64–68; at 60 to ~70–72; at 70 to ~76–77.[29][31]\n |\n| Wang clan of China, 1st c.

The concept of life expectancy may also be used in the context of manufactured objects,[9] though the related term[*dubious – discuss*] shelf life is commonly used for consumer products, and the terms \"mean time to breakdown\" and \"mean time between failures\" are used in engineering.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nThe earliest documented work on life expectancy was done in the 1660s by John Graunt,[10] Christiaan Huygens, and Lodewijck Huygens.[11]\n\n\n\n## Human patterns[edit]\n\n\n### Maximum[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIt is important to note that the life expectancy statistic is usually based on past mortality experience and assumes that the same age-specific mortality rates will continue. Thus, such life expectancy figures need to be adjusted for temporal trends before calculating how long a currently living individual of a particular age is expected to live. Period life expectancy remains a commonly used statistic to summarize the current health status of a population. However, for some purposes, such as pensions calculations, it is usual to adjust the life table used by assuming that age-specific death rates will continue to decrease over the years, as they have usually done in the past. That is often done by simply extrapolating past trends, but some models exist to account for the evolution of mortality, like the Lee–Carter model.[149]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe age-specific death rates are calculated separately for separate groups of data that are believed to have different mortality rates (such as males and females, or smokers and non-smokers) and are then used to calculate a life table from which one can calculate the probability of surviving to each age. While the data required are easily identified in the case of humans, the computation of life expectancy of industrial products and wild animals involves more indirect techniques. The life expectancy and demography of wild animals are often estimated by capturing, marking, and recapturing them.[148] The life of a product, more often termed shelf life, is also computed using similar methods. In the case of long-lived components, such as those used in critical applications (e.g. aircraft), methods like accelerated aging are used to model the life expectancy of a component.[9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Pink: Countries where female life expectancy at birth is higher than males.

Despite the association, among identical twin pairs with different education levels, there is only weak evidence of a relationship between educational attainment and adult mortality.[130]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe longest verified lifespan for any human is that of Frenchwoman Jeanne Calment, who is verified as having lived to age 122 years, 164 days, between 21 February 1875 and 4 August 1997. This is referred to as the \"maximum life span\", which is the upper boundary of life, the maximum number of years any human is known to have lived.[12] A theoretical study shows that the maximum life expectancy at birth is limited by the human life characteristic value δ, which is around 104 years.[13] According to a study by biologists Bryan G. Hughes and Siegfried Hekimi, there is no evidence for limit on human lifespan.[14][15] However, this view has been questioned on the basis of error patterns.[16]\n\n\nRecords of human lifespan above age 100 are highly susceptible to errors.[16] For example, the previous world-record holder for human lifespan, Carrie C. White was uncovered as a simple typographic error after more than two decades.[16][*failed verification*]\n\n\n\n### Variation over time[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n2. Forecasting age-specific death rates and computing the life expectancy from the results with life table methods. This is usually more complex than simply forecasting life expectancy because the analyst must deal with correlated age-specific mortality rates, but it seems to be more robust than simple one-dimensional time series approaches. It also yields a set of age-specific rates that may be used to derive other measures, such as survival curves or life expectancies at different ages. The most important approach in this group is the Lee-Carter model,[153] which uses the singular value decomposition on a set of transformed age-specific mortality rates to reduce their dimensionality to a single time series, forecasts that time series, and then recovers a full set of age-specific mortality rates from that forecasted value. The software includes Professor Rob J. Hyndman's R package called 'demography' and UC Berkeley's LCFIT system.\n\n\n## Policy uses[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nForecasting life expectancy and mortality form an important subdivision of demography. Future trends in life expectancy have huge implications for old-age support programs (like U.S. Social Security and pension) since the cash flow in these systems depends on the number of recipients who are still living (along with the rate of return on the investments or the tax rate in pay-as-you-go systems). With longer life expectancies, the systems see increased cash outflow; if the systems underestimate increases in life-expectancies, they will be unprepared for the large payments that will occur, as humans live longer and longer.\n\n\nLife expectancy forecasting is usually based on one of two different approaches:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs discussed above, on an individual basis, some factors correlate with longer life. Factors that are associated with variations in life expectancy include family history, marital status, economic status, physique, exercise, diet, drug use (including smoking and alcohol consumption), disposition, education, environment, sleep, climate, and health care.[12]\n\n\n\n## Healthy life expectancy[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n70. **^** Wilkinson, Richard & Kate Pickett (2009). *The Spirit Level: Why Greater Equality Makes Societies Stronger*.

Not at all. This is one of the biggest misconceptions about old age: we are not living any longer.\" The maximum life span, or oldest age a human can live, may be constant.[157] Further, there are many examples of people living significantly longer than the average life expectancy of their time period, such as Socrates (71), Saint Anthony the Great (105), Michelangelo (88), and John Adams (90).[157]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n95. **^** Ruby, J.G.; Wright, K.M.; Rand, K.A.; Kermany, A.; Noto, K.; Curtis, D; Varner, N.; Garrigan, D.; Slinkov, D.; Dorfman, I.; Granka, J.M.; Byrnes, J.; Myres, N.; Ball, C.

Forecasting the life expectancy directly, generally using ARIMA or other time-series extrapolation procedures. This has the advantage of simplicity, but it cannot account for changes in mortality at specific ages, and the forecast number cannot be used to derive other life table results. Analyses and forecasts using this approach can be done with any common statistical/mathematical software package, like EViews, R, SAS, Stata, Matlab, or SPSS.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBy definition, life expectancy is an arithmetic mean. It can also be calculated by integrating the survival curve from 0 to positive infinity (or equivalently to the maximum lifespan, sometimes called 'omega'). For an extinct or completed cohort (all people born in the year 1850, for example), it can of course simply be calculated by averaging the ages at death. For cohorts with some survivors, it is estimated by using mortality experience in recent years. The estimates are called period cohort life expectancies.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHowever, anthropologist John D. Hawks criticizes the popular conflation of life span (life expectancy) and maximum life span when popular science writers falsely imply that the average adult human does not live longer than their ancestors. He writes, \"[a]ge-specific mortality rates have declined across the adult lifespan. A smaller fraction of adults die at 20, at 30, at 40, at 50, and so on across the lifespan. As a result, we live longer on average... In every way we can measure, human lifespans are longer today than in the immediate past, and longer today than they were 2000 years ago... age-specific mortality rates in adults really have reduced substantially.\"[160]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| by country | * World\n* Africa\n* Americas\n\t+ North America\n\t+ South America\n* Asia\n* Europe\n* Oceania\n* World regions\n |\n| regions of countries | * Argentina\n* Australia\n* Belgium\n* Brazil\n* Canada\n* China\n\t+ Cities\n* France\n* Germany\n* Greece\n* India\n* Italy\n* Japan\n* Mexico\n* Russia\n* South Africa\n* Spain\n* Turkey\n* UK\n* USA\n\t+ shortest\n\t+ longest\n* European regions\n |\n\n |\n| Records | * Longevity claims\n* Oldest people\n\t+ verified\n\t+ by country\n\t+ living\n |\n| Immortality | * Biological immortality\n\t+ Regeneration\n* Digital immortality\n* Eternal youth\n* Immortality in fiction\n |\n| Longevity genes | * FOXO3\n* APOE\n* CETP\n* ACE\n* IL6\n* Klotho\n* SIRT1\n* TNF\n |\n| Related | * Blue zone\n* Longevity insurance\n* Longevity risk\n* Transhumanist politics\n* Longest-living organisms\n |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Authority control databases: National ![Edit this at Wikidata](image) | * France\n* BnF data\n* Germany\n* Israel\n* United States\n* Czech Republic\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n100. **^** United Nations \"World Population Ageing 2009\"; ST/ESA/SER.A/295, Population Division, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, United Nations, New York, Oct. 2010, liv + 73 pp.\n101. **^** Japan Times \"Centenarians to Hit Record 44,000\".

There was a 60% probability of surviving until age 15.[18] |\n| Neolithic | 20[19] – 33[20] | Based on Early Neolithic data, total life expectancy at 15 would be 28–33 years.[21] |\n| Bronze Age and Iron Age[22] | 26 | Based on Early and Middle Bronze Age data, total life expectancy at 15 would be 28–36 years.[21] |\n| Classical Greece[23] | 25[24] – 28[25] | Based on Athens Agora and Corinth data, total life expectancy at 15 would be 37–41 years.[21] Most Greeks and Romans died young. About half of all children died before adolescence. Those who survived to the age of 30 had a reasonable chance of reaching 50 or 60. The truly elderly, however, were rare. Because so many died in childhood, life expectancy at birth was probably between 20 and 30 years.[26] |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCities also experience a wide range of life expectancy based on neighborhood breakdowns. This is largely due to economic clustering and poverty conditions that tend to associate based on geographic location. Multi-generational poverty found in struggling neighborhoods also contributes. In United States cities such as Cincinnati, the life expectancy gap between low income and high-income neighborhoods touches 20 years.[69]\n\n\n\n### Economic circumstances[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAccording to a paper from 2015, the mortality rate for the Caucasian population in the United States from 1993 to 2001 is four times higher[*dubious – discuss*] for those who did not complete high school compared to those who have at least 16 years of education.[130] In fact, within the U.S. adult population, people with less than a high school education have the shortest life expectancies.\n\n\nPreschool education also plays a large role in life expectancy. It was found that high-quality early-stage childhood education had positive effects on health. Researchers discovered this by analyzing the results of the Carolina Abecedarian Project, finding that the disadvantaged children who were randomly assigned to treatment had lower instances of risk factors for cardiovascular and metabolic diseases in their mid-30s.[132]\n\n\n\n## Evolution and aging rate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Life history theory\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n13. **^** X.

In recent years, LEB in Eswatini (formerly Swaziland) is 49, while LEB in Japan is 83. The combination of high infant mortality and deaths in young adulthood from accidents, epidemics, plagues, wars, and childbirth, before modern medicine was widely available, significantly lowers LEB. For example, a society with a LEB of 40 would have relatively few people dying at exactly 40: most will die before 30 or after 55. In populations with high infant mortality rates, LEB is highly sensitive to the rate of death in the first few years of life. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn her extensive review of the existing literature, Kalben concluded that the fact that women live longer than men was observed at least as far back as 1750 and that, with relatively equal treatment, today males in all parts of the world experience greater mortality than females. However, Kalben's study was restricted to data in Western Europe alone, where the demographic transition occurred relatively early. United Nations statistics from mid-twentieth century onward, show that in all parts of the world, females have a higher life expectancy at age 60 than males.[87] Of 72 selected causes of death, only 6 yielded greater female than male age-adjusted death rates in 1998 in the United States. Except for birds, for almost all of the animal species studied, males have higher mortality than females. Evidence suggests that the sex mortality differential in people is due to both biological/genetic and environmental/behavioral risk and protective factors.[88]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn developed countries, starting around 1880, death rates decreased faster among women, leading to differences in mortality rates between males and females. Before 1880, death rates were the same. In people born after 1900, the death rate of 50- to 70-year-old men was double that of women of the same age. Men may be more vulnerable to cardiovascular disease than women, but this susceptibility was evident only after deaths from other causes, such as infections, started to decline.[93] Most of the difference in life expectancy between the sexes is accounted for by differences in the rate of death by cardiovascular diseases among persons aged 50–70.[94]\n\n\n\n### Genetics[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Genetics of aging\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLife expectancy is also likely to be affected by exposure to high levels of highway air pollution or industrial air pollution. This is one way that occupation can have a major effect on life expectancy. Coal miners (and in prior generations, asbestos cutters) often have lower life expectancies than average. Other factors affecting an individual's life expectancy are genetic disorders, drug use, tobacco smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, obesity, access to health care, diet, and exercise.\n\n\n\n### Sex differences[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Early Middle Ages (Europe, from the late 5th or early 6th century to the 10th century) | 30–35 | Life expectancy for those of both sexes who survived birth averaged about 30–35 years. However, if a Gaulish boy made it past age 20, he might expect to live 25 more years, while a woman at age 20 could normally expect about 17 more years. Anyone who survived until 40 had a good chance at another 15 to 20 years.[34] |\n| Pre-Columbian Mesoamerica[35] | >40 | The average Aztec life expectancy was 41.2 years for men and 42.1 for women.\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n56. **^** CDC (1999). \"Ten great public health achievements—United States, 1900–1999\". *MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep*. **48** (12): 241–3.

For example, a genome-wide association study of 1 million lifespans found 12 genetic loci which influenced lifespan by modifying susceptibility to cardiovascular and smoking-related disease.[96] The locus with the largest effect is APOE. Carriers of the APOE ε4 allele live approximately one year less than average (per copy of the ε4 allele), mainly due to increased risk of Alzheimer's disease.[96]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n102. **^** \"Resident Population.

Tapia Granados and Ana Diez Roux at the University of Michigan found that life expectancy actually *increased* during the Great Depression, and during recessions and depressions in general.[76] The authors suggest that when people are working at a more extreme degree during prosperous economic times, they undergo more stress, exposure to pollution, and the likelihood of injury among other longevity-limiting factors.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA paper from 2015 found that female foetuses have a higher mortality rate than male foetuses.[79] This finding contradicts papers dating from 2002 and earlier that attribute the male sex to higher in-utero mortality rates.[80][81][82] Among the smallest premature babies (those under 2 pounds (910 grams)), females have a higher survival rate. At the other extreme, about 90% of individuals aged 110 are female. The difference in life expectancy between men and women in the United States dropped from 7.8 years in 1979 to 5.3 years in 2005, with women expected to live to age 80.1 in 2005.[83] Data from the United Kingdom shows the gap in life expectancy between men and women decreasing in later life.

If a large amount of data is available, a statistical population can be created that allow the age-specific death rates to be simply taken as the mortality rates actually experienced at each age (the number of deaths divided by the number of years \"exposed to risk\" in each data cell). However, it is customary to apply smoothing to remove (as much as possible) the random statistical fluctuations from one year of age to the next. In the past, a very simple model used for this purpose was the Gompertz function, but more sophisticated methods are now used.[147] The most common modern methods include:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Life expectancy is higher in rich countries with low economic inequality.[70]\n![](image)Life expectancy vs healthcare spending of rich OECD countries. US average of $10,447 in 2018.[71]\nEconomic circumstances also affect life expectancy. For example, in the United Kingdom, life expectancy in the wealthiest and richest areas is several years higher than in the poorest areas. This may reflect factors such as diet and lifestyle, as well as access to medical care. It may also reflect a selective effect: people with chronic life-threatening illnesses are less likely to become wealthy or to reside in affluent areas.[72] In Glasgow, the disparity is amongst the highest in the world: life expectancy for males in the heavily deprived Calton area stands at 54, which is 28 years less than in the affluent area of Lenzie, which is only 8 km (5.0 mi) away.[73][74]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![Healthy Life Expectancy (HALE) vs GDP per Capita in different countries](image)Healthy Life Expectancy (HALE) vs GDP per Capita in different countries\nThe long-standing quest for longer life led in the 2010s to a more promising focus on increasing HALE, also known as a person's \"healthspan\". Besides the benefits of keeping people healthier longer, a goal is to reduce health-care expenses on the many diseases associated with cellular senescence. Approaches being explored include fasting, exercise, and senolytic drugs.[152]\n\n\n\n## Forecasting[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n61. **^** \"Life expectancy at birth, total (years)—Data\".\n62. **^** \"\"World Population Prospects—The 2002 Revision\", 2003, page 24\".\n63. **^** \"GHO—By category—Life expectancy—Data by country\".\n64. **^** \"Wealth & Health of Nations\".

For example, white Americans in 2010 are expected to live until age 78.9, but black Americans only until age 75.1. This 3.8-year gap, however, is the lowest it has been since 1975 at the latest. The greatest difference was 7.1 years in 1993.[66] In contrast, Asian-American women live the longest of all ethnic groups in the United States, with a life expectancy of 85.8 years.[67] The life expectancy of Hispanic-Americans is 81.2 years.[66] According to the new government reports in the US, life expectancy in the country dropped again because of the rise in suicide and drug overdose rates.

The modal age at death is the age when most deaths occur in a population, and is sometimes used instead of life expectancy for this kind of understanding. For example, in the table above, life expectancy in the Paleolithic is listed as 22–33 years. For many, this implies that most people in the Paleolithic died in their late twenties. However, in the Paleolithic, most adults in the Paleolithic died at *72 years* (the average modal adult life span).[161]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Biodemography\n* Calorie restriction\n* Demography\n* Depreciation\n* DNA damage theory of aging\n* Glasgow effect\n* Health equity\n* Life extension\n* Life table\n* Lindy effect\n* List of countries by life expectancy\n* List of countries by past life expectancy\n* List of longest-living organisms\n* LGBT life expectancy\n* Maximum life span\n* Medieval demography\n* Mitohormesis\n* Mortality rate\n* Population pyramid\n* Senescence\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n41. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** ***k*** ***l*** ***m*** ***n*** ***o*** Roser, Max; Ortiz-Ospina, Esteban; Ritchie, Hannah (2019) [First published in 2013]. \"Life Expectancy\". *Our World in Data*.

For instance, in a society with a life expectancy of 30, it may nevertheless be common to have a 40-year remaining timespan at age 5 (but perhaps not a 60-year one).\n\n\nUntil the middle of the 20th century, infant mortality was approximately 40–60% of the total mortality. Excluding child mortality, the average life expectancy during the 12th–19th centuries was approximately 55 years. If a person survived childhood, they had about a 50% chance of living 50–55 years, instead of only 25–40 years.[5] As of 2016, the overall worldwide life expectancy had reached the highest level that has been measured in modern times.[6]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"\"Life Expectancy\" – What does this actually mean?\". *Our World in Data*.

Since 2001, the World Health Organization has published statistics called **Healthy life expectancy** (**HALE**), defined as the average number of years that a person can expect to live in \"full health\" excluding the years lived in less than full health due to disease and/or injury.[150][151] Since 2004, Eurostat publishes annual statistics called Healthy Life Years (HLY) based on reported activity limitations.

The most commonly used measure is *life expectancy at birth* (LEB), which can be defined in two ways. *Cohort* LEB is the mean length of life of a birth cohort (in this case, all individuals born in a given year) and can be computed only for cohorts born so long ago that all their members have died. *Period* LEB is the mean length of life of a hypothetical cohort[1][2] assumed to be exposed, from birth through death, to the mortality rates observed at a given year.[3] National LEB figures reported by national agencies and international organizations for human populations are estimates of *period* LEB.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n### Increasing life expectancy[edit]\n\n\n* Strategies for engineered negligible senescence (SENS)\n* John Sperling\n* Life extension\n* Longevity\n* Rejuvenation\n* Public health\n* Infant mortality\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** In standard actuarial notation, *ex* refers to the expected future lifetime of *(x)* in whole years, while *eͦx* (with a ring above the *e*) denotes the complete expected future lifetime of *(x)*, including the fraction.\n2. **^** Japan's recorded life expectancy may have been very slightly increased by counting many infant deaths as stillborn.[58]\n3. **^**  Note the different units: a probability is unit-less, whereas a mortality rate has units (such as deaths per population per year).\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n80. **^** Kalben, Barbara Blatt. \"Why Men Die Younger: Causes of Mortality Differences by Sex\".

This confusion may create the expectation that an adult would be unlikely to exceed an life expectancy, even though, with all statistical probability, an adult, who has already avoided many statistical causes of adolescent mortality, should be expected to outlive the life expectancy calculated from birth.[157] One must compare the life expectancy of the period after childhood to estimate also the life expectancy of an adult.[157]\n\n\n  \n\nLife expectancy can change dramatically after childhood. In the table above, note the life expectancy *at birth* in the Paleolithic is 22–33 years, but life expectancy at 15 is 54 years. Additional studies similarly show a dramatic increase in life expectancy once adulthood was reached.[158][159]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLife expectancy is one of the factors in measuring the Human Development Index (HDI) of each nation along with adult literacy, education, and standard of living.[154]\n\n\nLife expectancy is used in describing the physical quality of life of an area. It is also used for an individual when the value of a life settlement is determined a life insurance policy is sold for a cash asset.[*clarification needed*]\n\n\nDisparities in life expectancy are often cited as demonstrating the need for better medical care or increased social support. A strongly associated indirect measure is income inequality. For the top 21 industrialized countries, if each person is counted equally, life expectancy is lower in more unequal countries (r = −0.907).[155] There is a similar relationship among states in the U.S. (r = −0.620).[156]\n\n\n\n## Life expectancy vs. other measures of longevity[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n147. **^** Anderson, Robert N.

The concept of life expectancy may also be used in the context of manufactured objects,[9] though the related term[*dubious – discuss*] shelf life is commonly used for consumer products, and the terms \"mean time to breakdown\" and \"mean time between failures\" are used in engineering.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nThe earliest documented work on life expectancy was done in the 1660s by John Graunt,[10] Christiaan Huygens, and Lodewijck Huygens.[11]\n\n\n\n## Human patterns[edit]\n\n\n### Maximum[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIt is important to note that the life expectancy statistic is usually based on past mortality experience and assumes that the same age-specific mortality rates will continue. Thus, such life expectancy figures need to be adjusted for temporal trends before calculating how long a currently living individual of a particular age is expected to live. Period life expectancy remains a commonly used statistic to summarize the current health status of a population. However, for some purposes, such as pensions calculations, it is usual to adjust the life table used by assuming that age-specific death rates will continue to decrease over the years, as they have usually done in the past. That is often done by simply extrapolating past trends, but some models exist to account for the evolution of mortality, like the Lee–Carter model.[149]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe age-specific death rates are calculated separately for separate groups of data that are believed to have different mortality rates (such as males and females, or smokers and non-smokers) and are then used to calculate a life table from which one can calculate the probability of surviving to each age. While the data required are easily identified in the case of humans, the computation of life expectancy of industrial products and wild animals involves more indirect techniques. The life expectancy and demography of wild animals are often estimated by capturing, marking, and recapturing them.[148] The life of a product, more often termed shelf life, is also computed using similar methods. In the case of long-lived components, such as those used in critical applications (e.g. aircraft), methods like accelerated aging are used to model the life expectancy of a component.[9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Pink: Countries where female life expectancy at birth is higher than males.

Despite the association, among identical twin pairs with different education levels, there is only weak evidence of a relationship between educational attainment and adult mortality.[130]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe longest verified lifespan for any human is that of Frenchwoman Jeanne Calment, who is verified as having lived to age 122 years, 164 days, between 21 February 1875 and 4 August 1997. This is referred to as the \"maximum life span\", which is the upper boundary of life, the maximum number of years any human is known to have lived.[12] A theoretical study shows that the maximum life expectancy at birth is limited by the human life characteristic value δ, which is around 104 years.[13] According to a study by biologists Bryan G. Hughes and Siegfried Hekimi, there is no evidence for limit on human lifespan.[14][15] However, this view has been questioned on the basis of error patterns.[16]\n\n\nRecords of human lifespan above age 100 are highly susceptible to errors.[16] For example, the previous world-record holder for human lifespan, Carrie C. White was uncovered as a simple typographic error after more than two decades.[16][*failed verification*]\n\n\n\n### Variation over time[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n2. Forecasting age-specific death rates and computing the life expectancy from the results with life table methods. This is usually more complex than simply forecasting life expectancy because the analyst must deal with correlated age-specific mortality rates, but it seems to be more robust than simple one-dimensional time series approaches. It also yields a set of age-specific rates that may be used to derive other measures, such as survival curves or life expectancies at different ages. The most important approach in this group is the Lee-Carter model,[153] which uses the singular value decomposition on a set of transformed age-specific mortality rates to reduce their dimensionality to a single time series, forecasts that time series, and then recovers a full set of age-specific mortality rates from that forecasted value. The software includes Professor Rob J. Hyndman's R package called 'demography' and UC Berkeley's LCFIT system.\n\n\n## Policy uses[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nForecasting life expectancy and mortality form an important subdivision of demography. Future trends in life expectancy have huge implications for old-age support programs (like U.S. Social Security and pension) since the cash flow in these systems depends on the number of recipients who are still living (along with the rate of return on the investments or the tax rate in pay-as-you-go systems). With longer life expectancies, the systems see increased cash outflow; if the systems underestimate increases in life-expectancies, they will be unprepared for the large payments that will occur, as humans live longer and longer.\n\n\nLife expectancy forecasting is usually based on one of two different approaches:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs discussed above, on an individual basis, some factors correlate with longer life. Factors that are associated with variations in life expectancy include family history, marital status, economic status, physique, exercise, diet, drug use (including smoking and alcohol consumption), disposition, education, environment, sleep, climate, and health care.[12]\n\n\n\n## Healthy life expectancy[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n70. **^** Wilkinson, Richard & Kate Pickett (2009). *The Spirit Level: Why Greater Equality Makes Societies Stronger*.

Not at all. This is one of the biggest misconceptions about old age: we are not living any longer.\" The maximum life span, or oldest age a human can live, may be constant.[157] Further, there are many examples of people living significantly longer than the average life expectancy of their time period, such as Socrates (71), Saint Anthony the Great (105), Michelangelo (88), and John Adams (90).[157]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n95. **^** Ruby, J.G.; Wright, K.M.; Rand, K.A.; Kermany, A.; Noto, K.; Curtis, D; Varner, N.; Garrigan, D.; Slinkov, D.; Dorfman, I.; Granka, J.M.; Byrnes, J.; Myres, N.; Ball, C.

Forecasting the life expectancy directly, generally using ARIMA or other time-series extrapolation procedures. This has the advantage of simplicity, but it cannot account for changes in mortality at specific ages, and the forecast number cannot be used to derive other life table results. Analyses and forecasts using this approach can be done with any common statistical/mathematical software package, like EViews, R, SAS, Stata, Matlab, or SPSS.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBy definition, life expectancy is an arithmetic mean. It can also be calculated by integrating the survival curve from 0 to positive infinity (or equivalently to the maximum lifespan, sometimes called 'omega'). For an extinct or completed cohort (all people born in the year 1850, for example), it can of course simply be calculated by averaging the ages at death. For cohorts with some survivors, it is estimated by using mortality experience in recent years. The estimates are called period cohort life expectancies.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHowever, anthropologist John D. Hawks criticizes the popular conflation of life span (life expectancy) and maximum life span when popular science writers falsely imply that the average adult human does not live longer than their ancestors. He writes, \"[a]ge-specific mortality rates have declined across the adult lifespan. A smaller fraction of adults die at 20, at 30, at 40, at 50, and so on across the lifespan. As a result, we live longer on average... In every way we can measure, human lifespans are longer today than in the immediate past, and longer today than they were 2000 years ago... age-specific mortality rates in adults really have reduced substantially.\"[160]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| by country | * World\n* Africa\n* Americas\n\t+ North America\n\t+ South America\n* Asia\n* Europe\n* Oceania\n* World regions\n |\n| regions of countries | * Argentina\n* Australia\n* Belgium\n* Brazil\n* Canada\n* China\n\t+ Cities\n* France\n* Germany\n* Greece\n* India\n* Italy\n* Japan\n* Mexico\n* Russia\n* South Africa\n* Spain\n* Turkey\n* UK\n* USA\n\t+ shortest\n\t+ longest\n* European regions\n |\n\n |\n| Records | * Longevity claims\n* Oldest people\n\t+ verified\n\t+ by country\n\t+ living\n |\n| Immortality | * Biological immortality\n\t+ Regeneration\n* Digital immortality\n* Eternal youth\n* Immortality in fiction\n |\n| Longevity genes | * FOXO3\n* APOE\n* CETP\n* ACE\n* IL6\n* Klotho\n* SIRT1\n* TNF\n |\n| Related | * Blue zone\n* Longevity insurance\n* Longevity risk\n* Transhumanist politics\n* Longest-living organisms\n |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Authority control databases: National ![Edit this at Wikidata](image) | * France\n* BnF data\n* Germany\n* Israel\n* United States\n* Czech Republic\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n100. **^** United Nations \"World Population Ageing 2009\"; ST/ESA/SER.A/295, Population Division, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, United Nations, New York, Oct. 2010, liv + 73 pp.\n101. **^** Japan Times \"Centenarians to Hit Record 44,000\".

There was a 60% probability of surviving until age 15.[18] |\n| Neolithic | 20[19] – 33[20] | Based on Early Neolithic data, total life expectancy at 15 would be 28–33 years.[21] |\n| Bronze Age and Iron Age[22] | 26 | Based on Early and Middle Bronze Age data, total life expectancy at 15 would be 28–36 years.[21] |\n| Classical Greece[23] | 25[24] – 28[25] | Based on Athens Agora and Corinth data, total life expectancy at 15 would be 37–41 years.[21] Most Greeks and Romans died young. About half of all children died before adolescence. Those who survived to the age of 30 had a reasonable chance of reaching 50 or 60. The truly elderly, however, were rare. Because so many died in childhood, life expectancy at birth was probably between 20 and 30 years.[26] |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCities also experience a wide range of life expectancy based on neighborhood breakdowns. This is largely due to economic clustering and poverty conditions that tend to associate based on geographic location. Multi-generational poverty found in struggling neighborhoods also contributes. In United States cities such as Cincinnati, the life expectancy gap between low income and high-income neighborhoods touches 20 years.[69]\n\n\n\n### Economic circumstances[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAccording to a paper from 2015, the mortality rate for the Caucasian population in the United States from 1993 to 2001 is four times higher[*dubious – discuss*] for those who did not complete high school compared to those who have at least 16 years of education.[130] In fact, within the U.S. adult population, people with less than a high school education have the shortest life expectancies.\n\n\nPreschool education also plays a large role in life expectancy. It was found that high-quality early-stage childhood education had positive effects on health. Researchers discovered this by analyzing the results of the Carolina Abecedarian Project, finding that the disadvantaged children who were randomly assigned to treatment had lower instances of risk factors for cardiovascular and metabolic diseases in their mid-30s.[132]\n\n\n\n## Evolution and aging rate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Life history theory\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n13. **^** X.

Such estimates reflected the life expectancy of adult males from the higher ranks of English society in the Middle Ages, and were similar to that computed for monks of the Christ Church in Canterbury during the 15th century.[30] At age 21, life expectancy of an aristocrat was an additional 43 years (total age 64).[38] |\n| Early modern Britain (16th – 18th century)[22] | 33–40 | For males in the 18th century it was 34 years.[39] For 15-year-old girls: around the 15th – 16th century it was ~33 years (48 total), and in the 18th century it was ~42 (57 total).[40] |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nLongevity\n |\n| --- |\n| Ageing | * Old age\n* Longevity myths\n* Senescence\n\t+ aging-associated diseases\n\t+ degenerative diseases\n\t+ negligible senescence\n* Gerontology\n\t+ biogerontology\n\t+ cognitive epidemiology\n* Centenarian\n\t+ supercentenarian\n\t+ research into centenarians\n* Life expectancy\n\t+ LGBT life expectancy\n* Maximum life span\n* Biomarkers of aging\n |\n| Life extension | * Topic outline\n\t+ index\n* Anti-aging movement\n* Biodemography of human longevity\n* Indefinite lifespan\n* Longevity escape velocity\n* Methods\n\t+ calorie restriction\n\t+ Diet and longevity\n\t+ gene therapy\n\t+ nanomedicine\n\t+ organ printing\n\t+ rejuvenation\n\t+ stem-cell therapy\n\t+ SENS\n |\n| Lists oflife expectancy | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the Bronze Age and the Iron Age, human LEB was 26 years[*citation needed*]; in 2010, world LEB was 67.2 years. In recent years, LEB in Eswatini (formerly Swaziland) is 49, while LEB in Japan is 83. The combination of high infant mortality and deaths in young adulthood from accidents, epidemics, plagues, wars, and childbirth, before modern medicine was widely available, significantly lowers LEB. For example, a society with a LEB of 40 would have relatively few people dying at exactly 40: most will die before 30 or after 55. In populations with high infant mortality rates, LEB is highly sensitive to the rate of death in the first few years of life. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn her extensive review of the existing literature, Kalben concluded that the fact that women live longer than men was observed at least as far back as 1750 and that, with relatively equal treatment, today males in all parts of the world experience greater mortality than females. However, Kalben's study was restricted to data in Western Europe alone, where the demographic transition occurred relatively early. United Nations statistics from mid-twentieth century onward, show that in all parts of the world, females have a higher life expectancy at age 60 than males.[87] Of 72 selected causes of death, only 6 yielded greater female than male age-adjusted death rates in 1998 in the United States. Except for birds, for almost all of the animal species studied, males have higher mortality than females. Evidence suggests that the sex mortality differential in people is due to both biological/genetic and environmental/behavioral risk and protective factors.[88]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn developed countries, starting around 1880, death rates decreased faster among women, leading to differences in mortality rates between males and females. Before 1880, death rates were the same. In people born after 1900, the death rate of 50- to 70-year-old men was double that of women of the same age. Men may be more vulnerable to cardiovascular disease than women, but this susceptibility was evident only after deaths from other causes, such as infections, started to decline.[93] Most of the difference in life expectancy between the sexes is accounted for by differences in the rate of death by cardiovascular diseases among persons aged 50–70.[94]\n\n\n\n### Genetics[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Genetics of aging\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLife expectancy is also likely to be affected by exposure to high levels of highway air pollution or industrial air pollution. This is one way that occupation can have a major effect on life expectancy. Coal miners (and in prior generations, asbestos cutters) often have lower life expectancies than average. Other factors affecting an individual's life expectancy are genetic disorders, drug use, tobacco smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, obesity, access to health care, diet, and exercise.\n\n\n\n### Sex differences[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Early Middle Ages (Europe, from the late 5th or early 6th century to the 10th century) | 30–35 | Life expectancy for those of both sexes who survived birth averaged about 30–35 years.

Anyone who survived until 40 had a good chance at another 15 to 20 years.[34] |\n| Pre-Columbian Mesoamerica[35] | >40 | The average Aztec life expectancy was 41.2 years for men and 42.1 for women.\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n56. **^** CDC (1999). \"Ten great public health achievements—United States, 1900–1999\". *MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep*. **48** (12): 241–3.

For example, a genome-wide association study of 1 million lifespans found 12 genetic loci which influenced lifespan by modifying susceptibility to cardiovascular and smoking-related disease.[96] The locus with the largest effect is APOE. Carriers of the APOE ε4 allele live approximately one year less than average (per copy of the ε4 allele), mainly due to increased risk of Alzheimer's disease.[96]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n102. **^** \"Resident Population.

There are many potential reasons for this. Traditional arguments tend to favor sociology-environmental factors: historically, men have generally consumed more tobacco, alcohol, and drugs than women in most societies, and are more likely to die from many associated diseases such as lung cancer, tuberculosis, and cirrhosis of the liver.[78] Men are also more likely to die from injuries, whether unintentional (such as occupational, war, or car wrecks) or intentional (suicide).[78] Men are also more likely to die from most of the leading causes of death (some already stated above) than women. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n142. **^** Hart RW, Setlow RB.

Tapia Granados and Ana Diez Roux at the University of Michigan found that life expectancy actually *increased* during the Great Depression, and during recessions and depressions in general.[76] The authors suggest that when people are working at a more extreme degree during prosperous economic times, they undergo more stress, exposure to pollution, and the likelihood of injury among other longevity-limiting factors.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA paper from 2015 found that female foetuses have a higher mortality rate than male foetuses.[79] This finding contradicts papers dating from 2002 and earlier that attribute the male sex to higher in-utero mortality rates.[80][81][82] Among the smallest premature babies (those under 2 pounds (910 grams)), females have a higher survival rate. At the other extreme, about 90% of individuals aged 110 are female. The difference in life expectancy between men and women in the United States dropped from 7.8 years in 1979 to 5.3 years in 2005, with women expected to live to age 80.1 in 2005.[83] Data from the United Kingdom shows the gap in life expectancy between men and women decreasing in later life. This may be attributable to the effects of infant mortality and young adult death rates.[84]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSome of these in the United States include cancer of the respiratory system, motor vehicle accidents, suicide, cirrhosis of the liver, emphysema, prostate cancer, and coronary heart disease.[12] These far outweigh the female mortality rate from breast cancer and cervical cancer. In the past, mortality rates for females in child-bearing age groups were higher than for males at the same age.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n108. **^** Reininghaus, Ulrich; Dutta, Rina; Dazzan, Paola; Doody, Gillian A.; Fearon, Paul; Lappin, Julia; Heslin, Margaret; Onyejiaka, Adanna; Donoghue, Kim; Lomas, Ben; Kirkbride, James B.; Murray, Robin M.; Croudace, Tim; Morgan, Craig; Jones, Peter B.

Beginning in the early 1950s, mortality steadily declined; it continued to decline through 1978 and remained relatively constant through 1987. One major fluctuation was reported in a computer reconstruction of China's population trends from 1953 to 1987 produced by the United States Bureau of the Census. The computer model showed that the crude death rate increased dramatically during the famine years associated with the Great Leap Forward (1958–60).[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* urban population: 64.6% of total population (2023)\n* rate of urbanization: 1.78% annual rate of change (2020-25 est.)\n\n\nnote: data do not include Hong Kong and Macau\n\n\n\nLife expectancy at birth\n* **Total population:** 76.31 years (2021)\n* **Male:** 74.23 years (2021)\n* **Female:** 78.62 years (2021)\n\n\nReligious affiliation\nMain article: Religion in China\n\n* *Predominantly:* Mahayana Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism (via ancestral worship).\n* *Others:* Christianity (3–4%), Islam (1.5%), ethnic minority religions, others.\n* *Note:* State atheism, but traditionally pragmatic and eclectic.\n\n\nSources:[80][81][82][83]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)China portal\n\n\n* Megalopolises in China\n* Metropolitan cities of China\n* Demographics of Central Asia\n* Demographics of Beijing\n* Population history of China\n* Secession in China\n* Language Atlas of China\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  | Area (km2) | Population | Density\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| China | 9,650,000 (100%) | 1,411,778,724 (100%) | 134.7/km2 |\n| **5 provinces** | 5,246,400 (54.45%) | 84,493,388 (5.98%) | 15.16/km2 |\n|  | Inner Mongolia | 1,183,000 (12.28% ) | 24,049,155 (1.70%) | 20.33/km2 |\n| Xinjiang | 1,660,000 (17.23%) | 25,852,345 (1.83%) | 12.62/km2 |\n| Tibet | 1,228,400 (12.75%) | 3,648,100 (0.26%) | 2.31/km2 |\n| Qinghai | 721,000 (7.48%) | 5,923,957 (0.42%) | 7.65/km2 |\n| Gansu | 454,000 (4.71%) | 25,019,831 (1.77%) | 57.65/km2 |\n| **Other provinces** | 4,403,605 (45.55%) | 1,327,285,336 (94.02%) | 277.27/km2 |\n| Source: National Bureau of Statistics |\n\n\n\n## Vital statistics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)China population changes 1949 - 2022\n### Table of births and deaths 1949–2022[edit]\n\n\nChina's fertility statistics differ depending on the source.

For instance, in the future the elderly might not be able to rely on their children to care for them as they have in the past, leaving the state to assume the expense, which could be considerable. Based on United Nations and Chinese government statistics, it was estimated in 1987 that by 2000 the population 60 years and older (the retirement age is 60 in urban areas) would number 127 million, or 10.1% of the total population; the projection for 2025 was 234 million elderly, or 16.4%. According to projections based on the 1982 census, if the one-child policy were maintained to the year 2000, 25% of China's population would be age 65 or older by 2040. In 2050, the number of people over 60 is expected to increase to 430 million.[21] Even though China has already opened two-child policy since 2016, data shows that the second-child policy cannot stop the problem of an aging population. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | −0.60\n | 1.09\n |\n\n\n### Total fertility rate from 1930 to 1949[edit]\n\n\nChildren born per woman from 1930 to 1949.

It is estimated that this imbalance will rise until 2025–2030 to reach 20% then slowly decrease.[28]\n\n\nAs of 2022[update], the National Health Commission reported 9.56 million births, the lowest figure on record since 1949.[29]\n\n\n\n### Total fertility rate[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | 17,020,000 | 8,180,000 | 8,840,000\n | 13.38 | 6.43 | 6.95 |  |\n| 2002\n | 1,280,400,000\n | 16,470,000 | 8,210,000 | 8,260,000\n | 12.86 | 6.41 | 6.45 |  |\n| 2003\n | 1,288,400,000\n | 15,990,000 | 8,250,000 | 7,740,000\n | 12.41 | 6.40 | 6.01 |  |\n| 2004\n | 1,296,075,000\n | 15,930,000 | 8,320,000 | 7,610,000\n | 12.29 | 6.42 | 5.87 |  |\n| 2005\n | 1,303,720,000\n | 16,170,000 | 8,490,000 | 7,680,000\n | 12.40 | 6.51 | 5.89\n | 1.51\n |\n| 2006\n | 1,311,020,000\n | 15,850,000 | 8,930,000 | 6,920,000\n | 12.09 | 6.81 | 5.28 | 1.50\n |\n| 2007\n | 1,317,885,000\n | 15,940,000 | 9,130,000 | 6,810,000\n | 12.10 | 6.93 | 5.17 | 1.53\n |\n| 2008\n | 1,324,655,000\n | 16,080,000 | 9,350,000 | 6,730,000\n | 12.14 | 7.06 | 5.08 | 1.55\n |\n| 2009\n | 1,331,260,000\n | 15,910,000 | 9,430,000 | 6,480,000\n | 11.95 | 7.08 | 4.87 | 1.54\n |\n| 2010\n | 1,337,705,000\n | 15,920,000 | 9,510,000 | 6,410,000\n | 11.90 | 7.11 | 4.79\n | 1.54\n |\n| 2011\n | 1,345,035,000\n | 17,970,000 | 9,600,000 | 8,370,000\n | 13.27 | 7.14 | 6.13 |  |\n| 2012\n | 1,354,190,000\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAccording to the 2000 census, the TFR was 1.22 (0.86 for cities, 1.08 for towns and 1.43 for villages/outposts).

In 1987, the government announced that the fourth national census would take place in 1990 and that there would be one every ten years thereafter. The 1982 census (which reported a total population of 1,008,180,738) is generally accepted as significantly more reliable, accurate, and thorough than the previous two.[15] Various international organizations eagerly assisted the Chinese in conducting the 1982 census, including the United Nations Fund for Population Activities, which donated US$100.0 million between 1980-1989 for a variety of projects, one of which being the 1982 census.[16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFuture challenges for China will be the gender disparity. According to the 2020 census, males account for 51.24% of China's 1.41 billion people, while females made up 48.76% of the total. The sex ratio (the number of males for each female in a population) at birth was 118.06 boys to every 100 girls (54.14%) in 2010, higher than the 116.86 (53.89%) of 2000, but 0.53 points lower than the ratio of 118.59 (54.25%) in 2005.[36] In most Western countries the sex ratio at birth is around 105 boys to 100 girls (51.22%).\n\n\n\n## Ethnic groups[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of ethnic groups in China.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n14. **^** Ng, Kelly (17 January 2023). \"China's population falls for first time since 1961\". *BBC News*.

In 2002, about 94% of the population lived east of the Heihe–Tengchong Line; although this eastern area comprises only 43% of China's total land area, its population density, at roughly 280/km2, is comparable to that of Japan.\n\n\nBroadly speaking, the population was concentrated east of the mountains[*which?*] and south of the northern steppe. The most densely populated areas included the Yangtze River Valley (of which the delta region was the most populous), Sichuan Basin, North China Plain, Pearl River Delta, and the industrial area around the city of Shenyang in the northeast.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n71. **^** \"Statistical Communiqué on the 2011 National Economic and Social Development\".

China's population growth rate is only 0.03%, ranking 159th in the world.[8] China conducted its sixth national population census in 2010,[9][10] and its seventh census was completed in late 2020, with data released in May 2021.[11] Unless otherwise indicated, the statistics on this page pertain to mainland China only; see also Demographics of Hong Kong, Demographics of Macau and Demographics of Taiwan.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ethnic groups in Chinese history\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | This section **needs expansion**.

For instance, in the future the elderly might not be able to rely on their children to care for them as they have in the past, leaving the state to assume the expense, which could be considerable. Based on United Nations and Chinese government statistics, it was estimated in 1987 that by 2000 the population 60 years and older (the retirement age is 60 in urban areas) would number 127 million, or 10.1% of the total population; the projection for 2025 was 234 million elderly, or 16.4%. According to projections based on the 1982 census, if the one-child policy were maintained to the year 2000, 25% of China's population would be age 65 or older by 2040. In 2050, the number of people over 60 is expected to increase to 430 million.[21] Even though China has already opened two-child policy since 2016, data shows that the second-child policy cannot stop the problem of an aging population. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | −0.60\n | 1.09\n |\n\n\n### Total fertility rate from 1930 to 1949[edit]\n\n\nChildren born per woman from 1930 to 1949.

In 1987, the government announced that the fourth national census would take place in 1990 and that there would be one every ten years thereafter. The 1982 census (which reported a total population of 1,008,180,738) is generally accepted as significantly more reliable, accurate, and thorough than the previous two.[15] Various international organizations eagerly assisted the Chinese in conducting the 1982 census, including the United Nations Fund for Population Activities, which donated US$100.0 million between 1980-1989 for a variety of projects, one of which being the 1982 census.[16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFuture challenges for China will be the gender disparity. According to the 2020 census, males account for 51.24% of China's 1.41 billion people, while females made up 48.76% of the total. The sex ratio (the number of males for each female in a population) at birth was 118.06 boys to every 100 girls (54.14%) in 2010, higher than the 116.86 (53.89%) of 2000, but 0.53 points lower than the ratio of 118.59 (54.25%) in 2005.[36] In most Western countries the sex ratio at birth is around 105 boys to 100 girls (51.22%).\n\n\n\n## Ethnic groups[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of ethnic groups in China.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n14. **^** Ng, Kelly (17 January 2023). \"China's population falls for first time since 1961\". *BBC News*.

However, the overall population density of China conceals major regional variations. In 2002, about 94% of the population lived east of the Heihe–Tengchong Line; although this eastern area comprises only 43% of China's total land area, its population density, at roughly 280/km2, is comparable to that of Japan.\n\n\nBroadly speaking, the population was concentrated east of the mountains[*which?*] and south of the northern steppe. The most densely populated areas included the Yangtze River Valley (of which the delta region was the most populous), Sichuan Basin, North China Plain, Pearl River Delta, and the industrial area around the city of Shenyang in the northeast.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n71. **^** \"Statistical Communiqué on the 2011 National Economic and Social Development\".

The number of children under the age of five peaked in 2007, and since then the number has been falling. The number of Indians under 15 years old peaked slightly later (in 2011) and is now also declining.[15]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"India overtakes China to become world's most populous country\". *The Guardian*. 24 April 2023.\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** \"Population & Demography Data Explorer\". *Our World in Data*.

The number of children under the age of five peaked in 2007, and since then the number has been falling. The number of Indians under 15 years old peaked slightly later (in 2011) and is now also declining.[15]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"India overtakes China to become world's most populous country\". *The Guardian*. 24 April 2023.\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** \"Population & Demography Data Explorer\". *Our World in Data*.

Approximately 55% of Indonesia's population resides on Java, which is the most populous island in the world.\n\n\nDespite a fairly effective family planning program that has been in place since 1967,[3] Indonesia's average population growth per year was over 1.1% for the decade ending in 2020, nearly having 13% population growth for that decade. At this rate, Indonesia's population is projected to surpass the population of the United States if the recent population growth continues.[4]\n\n\nIndonesia has a relatively young population compared to Western nations, though it is aging as the country's birth rate has slowed and its life expectancy has increased. The median age was 30.2 years in 2017.[5]\nIndonesia includes numerous ethnic, cultural and linguistic groups, some of which are related to each other. Since independence, Indonesian is the language of most written communication, education, government, and business. Many local ethnic languages are the first language of most Indonesians and are still important.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Provinces of Indonesia by population

Javanese is the largest group with 100 million people (42%), followed by Sundanese, who number nearly 40 million (15%).\n\n\n\n## Religions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Indonesia\n\nReligion in Indonesia (2022)[20]\n\n\n\nIslam (87.02%)\nChristianity (10.49%)\nHinduism (1.69%)\nBuddhism (0.73%)\nFolk/Other (0.04%)\nConfucianism (0.03%)\n\nIndonesia is the world's most populous Muslim-majority nation; based on civil registration data in 2022 from Ministry of Home Affairs, 87.02% of Indonesians are Muslims, 10.49% Christians (7.43% Protestants, 3.06% Roman Catholic), 1.69% Hindu, 0.73% Buddhists, 0.03% Confucians and 0.04% other faiths.[20] Most Indonesian Hindus are Balinese[21] and most Buddhists in modern-day Indonesia are Chinese.[22]\n\n\n\n## Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of Indonesia\n\nIndonesian is the official language, but there are many different languages native to Indonesia. According to Ethnologue, there are currently 737 living languages spoken in Indonesia,[23] the most widely spoken being Javanese and Sundanese. In Western New Guinea, there are more than 270 indigenous languages in spoken form.[24][25] Some Chinese varieties, most prominently Min Nan, are also spoken. The public use of Chinese, especially usage of Chinese characters, was dissuaded officially between 1966 and 1998.[26]\n\n\n\n## Literacy[edit]\n\n\n*definition:* age 15 and over can read and write\n  \n*total population:* 92.81%\n  \n*male:* 95.5%\n  \n*female:* 90.4% (2011 est.)\n\n\nEducation is free in state schools; it is compulsory for children through to grade 12. Although about 92% of eligible children are enrolled in primary school, a much smaller percentage attend full-time. About 44% of secondary school-age children attend junior high school, and some others of this age group attend vocational schools.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## CIA World Factbook demographic statistics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Population pyramid 2016\nThe following demographic statistics are from the CIA World Factbook,[27] unless otherwise indicated.\n\n\n**Age structure**\n\n\n\n*0-14 years:* 23.33%\n*15-64 years:* 70.72%\n*65 years and over:* 5.95% (2020 census)[28][29]\n**Median age**\n\n\n\n*total:* 31.1 years\n*male:* 30.5 years\n*female:* 31.8 years (2020 est.)\n**Birth rate**\n\n\n\n15.32 births/1,000 population (2022 est.)\n**Death rate**\n\n\n\n6.75 deaths/1,000 population (2022 est.)\n**Population growth rate**\n\n\n\n1.097% (2010 est.)\n1.04% (2012 est.)\n0.86% (2017 est.)\n0.79% (2022 est.)\n**Urbanization**\n\n\n\n*urban population:* 57.9% of total population (2022)\n*rate of urbanisation:* 1.99% annual rate of change (2020-25 est.)\n**Sex ratio**\n\n\n\n*at birth:* 1.05 male(s)/female\n*0-14 years:* 1.05 male(s)/female\n*15-24 years:* 1.05 male(s)/female\n*25-54 years:* 0.99 male(s)/female\n*55-64 years:* 0.98 male(s)/female\n*65 years and over:* 0.66 male(s)/female\n*total population:* 1 male(s)/female (2022 est.)\n**Infant mortality rate**\n\n\n\n*total:* 19.73 deaths/1,000 live births\n*male:* 22.15 deaths/1,000 live births\n*female:* 17.18 deaths/1,000 live births (2022 est.)\n**Life expectancy at birth**\n\n\n\n![](image)Life expectancy in Indonesia since 1927\n![](image)Life expectancy in Indonesia since 1960 by gender\n*total population:* 73.08 years\n*male:* 70.86 years\n*female:* 75.4 years (2022 est.)\n**Total fertility rate**\n\n\n\n2.01 children born/woman (2022 est.)\n**HIV/AIDS**\n\n\n\nAdult prevalence rate: 0.4% (2017 est.)\nPeople living with HIV/AIDS: 630,000 (2017 est.)\nHIV/AIDS deaths: 39,000 (2017 est.)\n**Obesity – adult prevalence rate**\n\n\n\n6.9% (2016)\n**Children under the age of 5 years underweight**\n\n\n\n19.9% (2013)\n**Nationality**\n\n\n\n*noun:* Indonesian(s)\n*adjective:* Indonesian\n*Ethnic groups:* Javanese 40.1%, Sundanese 15.5%, Malay 3.7%, Batak 3.6%, Madurese 3%, Betawi 2.9%, Minangkabau 2.7%, Buginese 2.7%, Bantenese 2%, Banjarese 1.7%, Balinese 1.7%, Acehnese 1.4%, Dayak 1.4%, Sasak 1.3%, Chinese 1.2%, other 15% (2010 est.)\n**Religions**\n\n\n\nMuslim 86.7%, Christianity 10.72% (Protestant 7.6% and Roman Catholic 3.12%), Hinduism 1.74%, other 0.8% (includes Buddhist and Confucian), unspecified 0.04% (2018 est.)\n**Languages**\n\n\n\nIndonesian (official, a form of Malay influenced by other languages of Indonesia), local languages (the most widely spoken of which is Javanese).\n**School life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)**\n\n\n\n*total:* 11 years\n*male:* 12 years\n*female:* 11 years (2005)\n**Education expenditures**\n\n\n\n2.8% of GDP (2014)\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Indonesia portal\n\n\n* Census in Indonesia\n* Culture of Indonesia\n* Native Indonesians\n* Overseas Indonesian\n* Transmigration program\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Hasil Sensus Penduduk 2020\" (PDF) (in Indonesian).

Approximately 55% of Indonesia's population resides on Java, which is the most populous island in the world.\n\n\nDespite a fairly effective family planning program that has been in place since 1967,[3] Indonesia's average population growth per year was over 1.1% for the decade ending in 2020, nearly having 13% population growth for that decade. At this rate, Indonesia's population is projected to surpass the population of the United States if the recent population growth continues.[4]\n\n\nIndonesia has a relatively young population compared to Western nations, though it is aging as the country's birth rate has slowed and its life expectancy has increased. The median age was 30.2 years in 2017.[5]\nIndonesia includes numerous ethnic, cultural and linguistic groups, some of which are related to each other. Since independence, Indonesian is the language of most written communication, education, government, and business. Many local ethnic languages are the first language of most Indonesians and are still important.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Provinces of Indonesia by population

Javanese is the largest group with 100 million people (42%), followed by Sundanese, who number nearly 40 million (15%).\n\n\n\n## Religions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Indonesia\n\nReligion in Indonesia (2022)[20]\n\n\n\nIslam (87.02%)\nChristianity (10.49%)\nHinduism (1.69%)\nBuddhism (0.73%)\nFolk/Other (0.04%)\nConfucianism (0.03%)\n\nIndonesia is the world's most populous Muslim-majority nation; based on civil registration data in 2022 from Ministry of Home Affairs, 87.02% of Indonesians are Muslims, 10.49% Christians (7.43% Protestants, 3.06% Roman Catholic), 1.69% Hindu, 0.73% Buddhists, 0.03% Confucians and 0.04% other faiths.[20] Most Indonesian Hindus are Balinese[21] and most Buddhists in modern-day Indonesia are Chinese.[22]\n\n\n\n## Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of Indonesia\n\nIndonesian is the official language, but there are many different languages native to Indonesia. According to Ethnologue, there are currently 737 living languages spoken in Indonesia,[23] the most widely spoken being Javanese and Sundanese. In Western New Guinea, there are more than 270 indigenous languages in spoken form.[24][25] Some Chinese varieties, most prominently Min Nan, are also spoken. The public use of Chinese, especially usage of Chinese characters, was dissuaded officially between 1966 and 1998.[26]\n\n\n\n## Literacy[edit]\n\n\n*definition:* age 15 and over can read and write\n  \n*total population:* 92.81%\n  \n*male:* 95.5%\n  \n*female:* 90.4% (2011 est.)\n\n\nEducation is free in state schools; it is compulsory for children through to grade 12. Although about 92% of eligible children are enrolled in primary school, a much smaller percentage attend full-time. About 44% of secondary school-age children attend junior high school, and some others of this age group attend vocational schools.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## CIA World Factbook demographic statistics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Population pyramid 2016\nThe following demographic statistics are from the CIA World Factbook,[27] unless otherwise indicated.\n\n\n**Age structure**\n\n\n\n*0-14 years:* 23.33%\n*15-64 years:* 70.72%\n*65 years and over:* 5.95% (2020 census)[28][29]\n**Median age**\n\n\n\n*total:* 31.1 years\n*male:* 30.5 years\n*female:* 31.8 years (2020 est.)\n**Birth rate**\n\n\n\n15.32 births/1,000 population (2022 est.)\n**Death rate**\n\n\n\n6.75 deaths/1,000 population (2022 est.)\n**Population growth rate**\n\n\n\n1.097% (2010 est.)\n1.04% (2012 est.)\n0.86% (2017 est.)\n0.79% (2022 est.)\n**Urbanization**\n\n\n\n*urban population:* 57.9% of total population (2022)\n*rate of urbanisation:* 1.99% annual rate of change (2020-25 est.)\n**Sex ratio**\n\n\n\n*at birth:* 1.05 male(s)/female\n*0-14 years:* 1.05 male(s)/female\n*15-24 years:* 1.05 male(s)/female\n*25-54 years:* 0.99 male(s)/female\n*55-64 years:* 0.98 male(s)/female\n*65 years and over:* 0.66 male(s)/female\n*total population:* 1 male(s)/female (2022 est.)\n**Infant mortality rate**\n\n\n\n*total:* 19.73 deaths/1,000 live births\n*male:* 22.15 deaths/1,000 live births\n*female:* 17.18 deaths/1,000 live births (2022 est.)\n**Life expectancy at birth**\n\n\n\n![](image)Life expectancy in Indonesia since 1927\n![](image)Life expectancy in Indonesia since 1960 by gender\n*total population:* 73.08 years\n*male:* 70.86 years\n*female:* 75.4 years (2022 est.)\n**Total fertility rate**\n\n\n\n2.01 children born/woman (2022 est.)\n**HIV/AIDS**\n\n\n\nAdult prevalence rate: 0.4% (2017 est.)\nPeople living with HIV/AIDS: 630,000 (2017 est.)\nHIV/AIDS deaths: 39,000 (2017 est.)\n**Obesity – adult prevalence rate**\n\n\n\n6.9% (2016)\n**Children under the age of 5 years underweight**\n\n\n\n19.9% (2013)\n**Nationality**\n\n\n\n*noun:* Indonesian(s)\n*adjective:* Indonesian\n*Ethnic groups:* Javanese 40.1%, Sundanese 15.5%, Malay 3.7%, Batak 3.6%, Madurese 3%, Betawi 2.9%, Minangkabau 2.7%, Buginese 2.7%, Bantenese 2%, Banjarese 1.7%, Balinese 1.7%, Acehnese 1.4%, Dayak 1.4%, Sasak 1.3%, Chinese 1.2%, other 15% (2010 est.)\n**Religions**\n\n\n\nMuslim 86.7%, Christianity 10.72% (Protestant 7.6% and Roman Catholic 3.12%), Hinduism 1.74%, other 0.8% (includes Buddhist and Confucian), unspecified 0.04% (2018 est.)\n**Languages**\n\n\n\nIndonesian (official, a form of Malay influenced by other languages of Indonesia), local languages (the most widely spoken of which is Javanese).\n**School life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)**\n\n\n\n*total:* 11 years\n*male:* 12 years\n*female:* 11 years (2005)\n**Education expenditures**\n\n\n\n2.8% of GDP (2014)\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Indonesia portal\n\n\n* Census in Indonesia\n* Culture of Indonesia\n* Native Indonesians\n* Overseas Indonesian\n* Transmigration program\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Hasil Sensus Penduduk 2020\" (PDF) (in Indonesian).
