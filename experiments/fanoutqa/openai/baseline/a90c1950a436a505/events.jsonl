During the centralized growth of Japan's economy following World War II, many large firms moved their headquarters from cities such as Osaka (the historical commercial capital) to Tokyo, in an attempt to take advantage of better access to the government. This trend has begun to slow due to ongoing population growth in Tokyo and the high cost of living there.\n\n\nTokyo was rated by the Economist Intelligence Unit as the most expensive (highest cost-of-living) city in the world for 14 years in a row ending in 2006, when it was replaced by Oslo, and later Paris.[101][102]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* To the west of the special wards, Tokyo Metropolis consists of cities, towns, and villages that enjoy the same legal status as those elsewhere in Japan. While serving as \"bed towns\" for those working in central Tokyo, some of them also have a local commercial and industrial base, such as Tachikawa. Collectively, these are often known as the Tama area or Western Tokyo. The far west of the Tama area is occupied by the district (*gun*) of Nishi-Tama. Much of this area is mountainous and unsuitable for urbanization. The highest mountain in Tokyo, Mount Kumotori, is 2,017 m (6,617 ft) high; other mountains in Tokyo include Takanosu (1,737 m (5,699 ft)), Odake (1,266 m (4,154 ft)), and Mitake (929 m (3,048 ft)). Lake Okutama, on the Tama River near Yamanashi Prefecture, is Tokyo's largest lake. The district is composed of three towns (Hinode, Mizuho and Okutama) and one village (Hinohara). \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n49. **^** \"Population of Tokyo, Japan\". *Mongabay*.

Twice in recent history has the metropolis been left in ruins: first in the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake and later after extensive firebombing in World War II.[87] Because of this, Tokyo's urban landscape consists mainly of modern and contemporary architecture, and older buildings are scarce.[87] Tokyo features many internationally famous forms of modern architecture including Tokyo International Forum, Asahi Beer Hall, Mode Gakuen Cocoon Tower, NTT Docomo Yoyogi Building and Rainbow Bridge. Tokyo features two distinctive towers: Tokyo Tower and Tokyo Skytree, the latter of which is the tallest tower in both Japan and the world, and the second tallest structure in the world after the Burj Khalifa in Dubai.[13] Mori Building Co started work on Tokyo's new tallest building which was set to be finished in March 2023. The project will cost 580 billion yen ($5.5 billion).[88]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n69. **^** Peel, M.C., Finlayson, B.L., and McMahon, T.A.: Updated world map of the Köppen-Geiger climate classification Archived February 10, 2017, at the Wayback Machine, Hydrol.

Governor Shintaro Ishihara created Japan's first emissions cap system, aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emission by a total of 25% by 2020 from the 2000 level.[89] Tokyo is an example of an urban heat island, and the phenomenon is especially serious in its special wards.[90][91] According to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government,[92] the annual mean temperature has increased by about 3 °C (5.4 °F) over the past 100 years. Tokyo has been cited as a \"convincing example of the relationship between urban growth and climate\".[90]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)A satellite photo of Tokyo in 2018 taken by ESA Sentinel-2\n![](image)The Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building\nThe mainland portion of Tokyo lies northwest of Tokyo Bay and measures about 90 km (56 mi) east to west and 25 km (16 mi) north to south. The average elevation in Tokyo is 40 m (131 ft).[49] Chiba Prefecture borders it to the east, Yamanashi to the west, Kanagawa to the south, and Saitama to the north. Mainland Tokyo is further subdivided into the special wards (occupying the eastern half) and the Tama area (多摩地域) stretching westwards. Tokyo has a latitude of 35.65 (near the 36th parallel north), which makes it more southern than Rome (41.90), Madrid (40.41), New York City (40.71) and Beijing (39.91).[50]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWithin the administrative boundaries of Tokyo Metropolis are two island chains in the Pacific Ocean directly south: the Izu Islands, and the Ogasawara Islands, which stretch more than 1,000 km (620 mi) away from the mainland. Because of these islands and the mountainous regions to the west, Tokyo's overall population density figures far under-represent the real figures for the urban and suburban regions of Tokyo.[51]\n\n\nUnder Japanese law, the prefecture of Tokyo is designated as a *to* (都), translated as *metropolis*.[52] Tokyo Prefecture is the most populous prefecture and the densest, with 6,100 inhabitants per square kilometer (16,000/sq mi); by geographic area it is the third-smallest, above only Osaka and Kagawa. Its administrative structure is similar to that of Japan's other prefectures. The 23 special wards (特別区, *tokubetsu-ku*), which until 1943 constituted the city of Tokyo, are self-governing municipalities, each having a mayor, a council, and the status of a city.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n東京都\n |\n| --- |\n| Metropolis\n |\n| Tokyo Metropolis |\n| ![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n**Clockwise from top:*** Nishi-Shinjuku and Mount Fuji\n* Tokyo Tower\n* National Diet Building\n* Tokyo Station\n* Tokyo Imperial Palace\n* Shibuya Crossing\n* Tokyo Skytree\n* and Rainbow Bridge\n |\n| \n![Flag of Tokyo](image)Flag\n![Official seal of Tokyo](image)Seal\n![Official logo of Tokyo](image)Emblem\n |\n| Anthem: \"Tokyo Metropolitan Song\" (東京都歌, *Tōkyō-to Ka*) |\n| ![Map](image)Interactive map outlining Tokyo\n |\n| ![Location within Japan](image)Location within Japan\n |\n| Coordinates: 35°41′23″N 139°41′32″E﻿ / ﻿35.68972°N 139.69222°E﻿ / 35.68972; 139.69222 |\n| Country | Japan |\n| Region | Kantō |\n| Island | Honshu |\n| Capital | Tokyo[1] |\n| Divisions | 23 special wards, 26 cities, 1 district, and 4 subprefectures |\n| Government |\n|  • Body | Tokyo Metropolitan Government |\n|  • Governor | Yuriko Koike (Indp.) |\n|  • Representatives | 42 |\n|  • Councilors | 11 |\n| Area[2]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n114. **^** \"The World's Busiest Pedestrian Crossing\". *WorldAtlas*.

The last recorded was the Hōei eruption which started on December 16, 1707, and ended about January 1, 1708 (16 days).[64] During the Hōei eruption, the ash amount was 4 cm in southern Tokyo (bay area) and 2 cm to 0.5 cm in central Tokyo.[65] Kanagawa had 16 cm to 8 cm ash and Saitama 0.5 to 0 cm.[65] If the wind blows north-east it could send volcanic ash to Tokyo metropolis.[66] According to the government, less than a millimeter of the volcanic ash from a Mount Fuji eruption could cause power grid problems such as blackouts and stop trains in the Tokyo metropolitan area.[66] A mixture of ash with rain could stick to cellphone antennas, power lines and cause temporary power outages.[66] The affected areas would need to be evacuated.[66]\n\n\n\n### Water management[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPopulation of Tokyo[96]\n| By area1 | Tokyo\n*Special wards*\nTama Area\nIslands\n | 12.79 million\n*8.653 million*\n4.109 million\n28,000\n |\n| By age2 | Juveniles (age 0–14)\nWorking (age 15–64)\nRetired (age 65+)\n | 1.461 million (11.8%)\n8.546 million (69.3%)\n2.332 million (18.9%)\n |\n| By hours3 | Day\nNight\n | 14.978 million\n12.416 million\n |\n| By nationality\n | Foreign residents\n | 364,6534 (2.9% of total)\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1 Estimates as of October 1, 2007.\n2 as of January 1, 2007.\n | 3 as of 2005[update] National Census.\n4 as of January 1, 2006.\n |\n\n |\n\n |\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* **1996:** ![United States](image) Atlanta\n* **2000:** ![Australia](image) Sydney\n* **2004:** ![Greece](image) Athens\n* **2008:** ![China](image) Beijing\n* **2012:** ![United Kingdom](image) London\n* **2016:** ![Brazil](image) Rio de Janeiro\n* **2020:** ![Japan](image) Tokyo[c3]\n* ***2024:** ![France](image) Paris*\n* ***2028:** ![United States](image) Los Angeles*\n* ***2032:** ![Australia](image) Brisbane*\n |\n| [c1] Cancelled due to World War I; [c2] Cancelled due to World War II; [c3] Postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n64. **^** Masato Oyama (March 2007). 宝永四年（1707）噴火 (1707 Eruption). 富士山歴史噴火総解説 (Database of eruptions and other activities of Fuji Volcano, Japan, based on historical records since AD 781) (in Japanese).

The growing season in Tokyo lasts for about 322 days from around mid-February to early January.[71] Snowfall is sporadic, and occurs almost annually.[72] Tokyo often sees typhoons every year, though few are strong. The wettest month since records began in 1876 was October 2004, with 780 millimeters (30 in) of rain,[73] including 270.5 mm (10.65 in) on the ninth of that month.[74] The most recent of four months on record to observe no precipitation is December 1995.[70] Annual precipitation has ranged from 879.5 mm (34.63 in) in 1984 to 2,229.6 mm (87.78 in) in 1938.[70]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n108. **^** Kato, Issei (September 29, 2018). \"As Tokyo's historic Tsukiji market closes, fishmongers mourn\". *Reuters*.

In 1603, however, the city ascended to political prominence after being named the seat of the Tokugawa shogunate. By the mid-18th century, Edo emerged as one of the world's most-populous cities with a population of over one million people. Following the Meiji Restoration in 1868, the imperial capital in Kyoto was moved to Edo, and the city was renamed Tokyo (lit. 'Eastern Capital'). In 1923, Tokyo was damaged substantially by the Great Kanttō earthquake and was later decimated by allied bombing raids during World War II in retailiation for Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor. \n\n\nSince 1943, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government has administered the prefecture's special wards, including Tokyo City), various commuter towns and suburbs in its western area, and two outlying island chains known as the Tokyo Islands.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Tokyo Metropolis | * Special wards of Tokyo※\n\t+ Adachi\n\t+ Arakawa\n\t+ Bunkyō\n\t+ Chiyoda\n\t+ Chūō\n\t+ Edogawa\n\t+ Itabashi\n\t+ Katsushika\n\t+ Kita\n\t+ Kōtō\n\t+ Meguro\n\t+ Minato\n\t+ Nakano\n\t+ Nerima\n\t+ Ōta\n\t+ Setagaya\n\t+ Shibuya\n\t+ Shinagawa\n\t+ Shinjuku\n\t+ Suginami\n\t+ Sumida\n\t+ Toshima\n\t+ Taitō\n |\n| Designated cities | * Chiba※\n* Fukuoka※\n* Hamamatsu\n* Hiroshima※\n* Kawasaki\n* Kitakyushu\n* Kobe※\n* Kumamoto※\n* Kyoto※\n* Nagoya※\n* Niigata※\n* Okayama※\n* Osaka※\n* Sagamihara\n* Saitama※\n* Sakai\n* Sapporo※\n* Sendai※\n* Shizuoka※\n* Yokohama※\n |\n| Core cities | * Akashi\n* Akita※\n* Amagasaki\n* Aomori※\n* Asahikawa\n* Fukui※\n* Fukushima※\n* Fukuyama\n* Funabashi\n* Gifu※\n* Hachinohe\n* Hachiōji\n* Hakodate\n* Higashiōsaka\n* Himeji\n* Hirakata\n* Ichinomiya\n* Iwaki\n* Kagoshima※\n* Kanazawa※\n* Kashiwa\n* Kawagoe\n* Kawaguchi\n* Kōchi※\n* Kōfu※\n* Kōriyama\n* Koshigaya\n* Kurashiki\n* Kure\n* Kurume\n* Maebashi※\n* Matsue※\n* Matsumoto\n* Matsuyama※\n* Miyazaki※\n* Mito※\n* Morioka※\n* Naha※\n* Nagano※\n* Nagasaki※\n* Nara※\n* Neyagawa\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Flag, name w/o suffix | Full name\n | District orSubprefecture | Population\n | LPE code(w/o checksum) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Japanese | Transcription | Translation |\n| ![](image) Adachi | 足立区 | Adachi-ku | Adachi Ward | —\n | 674,067 | 13121\n |\n| ![](image) Arakawa | 荒川区 | Arakawa-ku | Arakawa Ward\n | 213,648 | 13118\n |\n| ![](image) Bunkyō | 文京区 | Bunkyō-ku | Bunkyō Ward\n | 223,389 | 13105\n |\n| ![](image) Chiyoda | 千代田区 | Chiyoda-ku | Chiyoda Ward\n | 59,441 | 13101\n |\n| ![](image) Chūō | 中央区 | Chūō-ku | Chūō Ward(Central Ward)\n | 147,620 | 13102\n |\n| ![](image) Edogawa | 江戸川区 | Edogawa-ku | Edogawa Ward(Edo River Ward)\n | 685,899 | 13123\n |\n| ![](image) Itabashi | 板橋区 | Itabashi-ku | Itabashi Ward\n | 569,225 | 13119\n |\n| ![](image) Katsushika | 葛飾区 | Katsushika-ku | Katsushika Ward(after Katsushika District) | 447,140 | 13122\n |\n| ![](image) Kita | 北区 | Kita-ku | Kita Ward(North Ward)\n | 345,063 | 13117\n |\n| ![](image) Kōtō | 江東区 | Kōtō-ku | Kōtō Ward\n | 502,579 | 13108\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | 18.2(64.8)\n | 21.2(70.2)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | 8.9(48.0)\n | 7.8(46.0)\n | 9.2(48.6)\n | 10.7(51.3)\n | 13.9(57.0)\n | 17.7(63.9)\n | 20.8(69.4)\n | 22.2(72.0)\n | 19.6(67.3)\n | 17.2(63.0)\n | 13.2(55.8)\n | 10.8(51.4)\n | 7.8(46.0)\n |\n| Average rainfall mm (inches)\n | 63.6(2.50)\n | 51.6(2.03)\n | 75.8(2.98)\n | 113.3(4.46)\n | 151.9(5.98)\n | 111.8(4.40)\n | 79.5(3.13)\n | 123.3(4.85)\n | 144.2(5.68)\n | 141.7(5.58)\n | 136.1(5.36)\n | 103.3(4.07)\n | 1,296.1(51.02)\n |\n| Average rainy days (≥ 0.5 mm) | 11.0\n | 8.5\n | 9.8\n | 10.0\n | 11.8\n | 8.8\n | 8.6\n | 11.3\n | 13.4\n | 13.7\n | 12.0\n | 11.2\n | 130.1\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 66\n | 68\n | 72\n | 79\n | 84\n | 86\n | 82\n | 82\n | 82\n | 81\n | 76\n | 70\n | 77\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 131.3\n | 138.3\n | 159.2\n | 148.3\n | 151.8\n | 205.6\n | 246.8\n | 213.7\n | 197.7\n | 173.2\n | 139.1\n | 125.3\n | 2,030.3\n |\n| Source: Japan Meteorological Agency[84][85] |\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_lhPzB08pXf7UVb63hC5gz2ax","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

During the centralized growth of Japan's economy following World War II, many large firms moved their headquarters from cities such as Osaka (the historical commercial capital) to Tokyo, in an attempt to take advantage of better access to the government. This trend has begun to slow due to ongoing population growth in Tokyo and the high cost of living there.\n\n\nTokyo was rated by the Economist Intelligence Unit as the most expensive (highest cost-of-living) city in the world for 14 years in a row ending in 2006, when it was replaced by Oslo, and later Paris.[101][102]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* To the west of the special wards, Tokyo Metropolis consists of cities, towns, and villages that enjoy the same legal status as those elsewhere in Japan. While serving as \"bed towns\" for those working in central Tokyo, some of them also have a local commercial and industrial base, such as Tachikawa. Collectively, these are often known as the Tama area or Western Tokyo. The far west of the Tama area is occupied by the district (*gun*) of Nishi-Tama. Much of this area is mountainous and unsuitable for urbanization. The highest mountain in Tokyo, Mount Kumotori, is 2,017 m (6,617 ft) high; other mountains in Tokyo include Takanosu (1,737 m (5,699 ft)), Odake (1,266 m (4,154 ft)), and Mitake (929 m (3,048 ft)). Lake Okutama, on the Tama River near Yamanashi Prefecture, is Tokyo's largest lake. The district is composed of three towns (Hinode, Mizuho and Okutama) and one village (Hinohara). \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n49. **^** \"Population of Tokyo, Japan\". *Mongabay*.

Twice in recent history has the metropolis been left in ruins: first in the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake and later after extensive firebombing in World War II.[87] Because of this, Tokyo's urban landscape consists mainly of modern and contemporary architecture, and older buildings are scarce.[87] Tokyo features many internationally famous forms of modern architecture including Tokyo International Forum, Asahi Beer Hall, Mode Gakuen Cocoon Tower, NTT Docomo Yoyogi Building and Rainbow Bridge. Tokyo features two distinctive towers: Tokyo Tower and Tokyo Skytree, the latter of which is the tallest tower in both Japan and the world, and the second tallest structure in the world after the Burj Khalifa in Dubai.[13] Mori Building Co started work on Tokyo's new tallest building which was set to be finished in March 2023. The project will cost 580 billion yen ($5.5 billion).[88]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n69. **^** Peel, M.C., Finlayson, B.L., and McMahon, T.A.: Updated world map of the Köppen-Geiger climate classification Archived February 10, 2017, at the Wayback Machine, Hydrol.

By 1953, the number of municipalities had dropped to 97.

There are four national parks in Tokyo Prefecture, including the Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park, which includes all of the Izu Islands.\n\n\n\n![](image)\nA panoramic view of Tokyo from the Tokyo Skytree\n\n## Environment[edit]\n\n\nTokyo has enacted a measure to cut greenhouse gases. Governor Shintaro Ishihara created Japan's first emissions cap system, aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emission by a total of 25% by 2020 from the 2000 level.[89] Tokyo is an example of an urban heat island, and the phenomenon is especially serious in its special wards.[90][91] According to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government,[92] the annual mean temperature has increased by about 3 °C (5.4 °F) over the past 100 years. Tokyo has been cited as a \"convincing example of the relationship between urban growth and climate\".[90]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)A satellite photo of Tokyo in 2018 taken by ESA Sentinel-2\n![](image)The Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building\nThe mainland portion of Tokyo lies northwest of Tokyo Bay and measures about 90 km (56 mi) east to west and 25 km (16 mi) north to south. The average elevation in Tokyo is 40 m (131 ft).[49] Chiba Prefecture borders it to the east, Yamanashi to the west, Kanagawa to the south, and Saitama to the north. Mainland Tokyo is further subdivided into the special wards (occupying the eastern half) and the Tama area (多摩地域) stretching westwards. Tokyo has a latitude of 35.65 (near the 36th parallel north), which makes it more southern than Rome (41.90), Madrid (40.41), New York City (40.71) and Beijing (39.91).[50]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWithin the administrative boundaries of Tokyo Metropolis are two island chains in the Pacific Ocean directly south: the Izu Islands, and the Ogasawara Islands, which stretch more than 1,000 km (620 mi) away from the mainland. Because of these islands and the mountainous regions to the west, Tokyo's overall population density figures far under-represent the real figures for the urban and suburban regions of Tokyo.[51]\n\n\nUnder Japanese law, the prefecture of Tokyo is designated as a *to* (都), translated as *metropolis*.[52] Tokyo Prefecture is the most populous prefecture and the densest, with 6,100 inhabitants per square kilometer (16,000/sq mi); by geographic area it is the third-smallest, above only Osaka and Kagawa. Its administrative structure is similar to that of Japan's other prefectures. The 23 special wards (特別区, *tokubetsu-ku*), which until 1943 constituted the city of Tokyo, are self-governing municipalities, each having a mayor, a council, and the status of a city.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n東京都\n |\n| --- |\n| Metropolis\n |\n| Tokyo Metropolis |\n| ![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n**Clockwise from top:*** Nishi-Shinjuku and Mount Fuji\n* Tokyo Tower\n* National Diet Building\n* Tokyo Station\n* Tokyo Imperial Palace\n* Shibuya Crossing\n* Tokyo Skytree\n* and Rainbow Bridge\n |\n| \n![Flag of Tokyo](image)Flag\n![Official seal of Tokyo](image)Seal\n![Official logo of Tokyo](image)Emblem\n |\n| Anthem: \"Tokyo Metropolitan Song\" (東京都歌, *Tōkyō-to Ka*) |\n| ![Map](image)Interactive map outlining Tokyo\n |\n| ![Location within Japan](image)Location within Japan\n |\n| Coordinates: 35°41′23″N 139°41′32″E﻿ / ﻿35.68972°N 139.69222°E﻿ / 35.68972; 139.69222 |\n| Country | Japan |\n| Region | Kantō |\n| Island | Honshu |\n| Capital | Tokyo[1] |\n| Divisions | 23 special wards, 26 cities, 1 district, and 4 subprefectures |\n| Government |\n|  • Body | Tokyo Metropolitan Government |\n|  • Governor | Yuriko Koike (Indp.) |\n|  • Representatives | 42 |\n|  • Councilors | 11 |\n| Area[2]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n114. **^** \"The World's Busiest Pedestrian Crossing\". *WorldAtlas*.

In 1603, however, the city ascended to political prominence after being named the seat of the Tokugawa shogunate. By the mid-18th century, Edo emerged as one of the world's most-populous cities with a population of over one million people. Following the Meiji Restoration in 1868, the imperial capital in Kyoto was moved to Edo, and the city was renamed Tokyo (lit. 'Eastern Capital'). In 1923, Tokyo was damaged substantially by the Great Kanttō earthquake and was later decimated by allied bombing raids during World War II in retailiation for Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor. \n\n\nSince 1943, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government has administered the prefecture's special wards, including Tokyo City), various commuter towns and suburbs in its western area, and two outlying island chains known as the Tokyo Islands.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Tokyo Metropolis | * Special wards of Tokyo※\n\t+ Adachi\n\t+ Arakawa\n\t+ Bunkyō\n\t+ Chiyoda\n\t+ Chūō\n\t+ Edogawa\n\t+ Itabashi\n\t+ Katsushika\n\t+ Kita\n\t+ Kōtō\n\t+ Meguro\n\t+ Minato\n\t+ Nakano\n\t+ Nerima\n\t+ Ōta\n\t+ Setagaya\n\t+ Shibuya\n\t+ Shinagawa\n\t+ Shinjuku\n\t+ Suginami\n\t+ Sumida\n\t+ Toshima\n\t+ Taitō\n |\n| Designated cities | * Chiba※\n* Fukuoka※\n* Hamamatsu\n* Hiroshima※\n* Kawasaki\n* Kitakyushu\n* Kobe※\n* Kumamoto※\n* Kyoto※\n* Nagoya※\n* Niigata※\n* Okayama※\n* Osaka※\n* Sagamihara\n* Saitama※\n* Sakai\n* Sapporo※\n* Sendai※\n* Shizuoka※\n* Yokohama※\n |\n| Core cities | * Akashi\n* Akita※\n* Amagasaki\n* Aomori※\n* Asahikawa\n* Fukui※\n* Fukushima※\n* Fukuyama\n* Funabashi\n* Gifu※\n* Hachinohe\n* Hachiōji\n* Hakodate\n* Higashiōsaka\n* Himeji\n* Hirakata\n* Ichinomiya\n* Iwaki\n* Kagoshima※\n* Kanazawa※\n* Kashiwa\n* Kawagoe\n* Kawaguchi\n* Kōchi※\n* Kōfu※\n* Kōriyama\n* Koshigaya\n* Kurashiki\n* Kure\n* Kurume\n* Maebashi※\n* Matsue※\n* Matsumoto\n* Matsuyama※\n* Miyazaki※\n* Mito※\n* Morioka※\n* Naha※\n* Nagano※\n* Nagasaki※\n* Nara※\n* Neyagawa\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Flag, name w/o suffix | Full name\n | District orSubprefecture | Population\n | LPE code(w/o checksum) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Japanese | Transcription | Translation |\n| ![](image) Adachi | 足立区 | Adachi-ku | Adachi Ward | —\n | 674,067 | 13121\n |\n| ![](image) Arakawa | 荒川区 | Arakawa-ku | Arakawa Ward\n | 213,648 | 13118\n |\n| ![](image) Bunkyō | 文京区 | Bunkyō-ku | Bunkyō Ward\n | 223,389 | 13105\n |\n| ![](image) Chiyoda | 千代田区 | Chiyoda-ku | Chiyoda Ward\n | 59,441 | 13101\n |\n| ![](image) Chūō | 中央区 | Chūō-ku | Chūō Ward(Central Ward)\n | 147,620 | 13102\n |\n| ![](image) Edogawa | 江戸川区 | Edogawa-ku | Edogawa Ward(Edo River Ward)\n | 685,899 | 13123\n |\n| ![](image) Itabashi | 板橋区 | Itabashi-ku | Itabashi Ward\n | 569,225 | 13119\n |\n| ![](image) Katsushika | 葛飾区 | Katsushika-ku | Katsushika Ward(after Katsushika District) | 447,140 | 13122\n |\n| ![](image) Kita | 北区 | Kita-ku | Kita Ward(North Ward)\n | 345,063 | 13117\n |\n| ![](image) Kōtō | 江東区 | Kōtō-ku | Kōtō Ward\n | 502,579 | 13108\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | 18.2(64.8)\n | 21.2(70.2)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | 8.9(48.0)\n | 7.8(46.0)\n | 9.2(48.6)\n | 10.7(51.3)\n | 13.9(57.0)\n | 17.7(63.9)\n | 20.8(69.4)\n | 22.2(72.0)\n | 19.6(67.3)\n | 17.2(63.0)\n | 13.2(55.8)\n | 10.8(51.4)\n | 7.8(46.0)\n |\n| Average rainfall mm (inches)\n | 63.6(2.50)\n | 51.6(2.03)\n | 75.8(2.98)\n | 113.3(4.46)\n | 151.9(5.98)\n | 111.8(4.40)\n | 79.5(3.13)\n | 123.3(4.85)\n | 144.2(5.68)\n | 141.7(5.58)\n | 136.1(5.36)\n | 103.3(4.07)\n | 1,296.1(51.02)\n |\n| Average rainy days (≥ 0.5 mm) | 11.0\n | 8.5\n | 9.8\n | 10.0\n | 11.8\n | 8.8\n | 8.6\n | 11.3\n | 13.4\n | 13.7\n | 12.0\n | 11.2\n | 130.1\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 66\n | 68\n | 72\n | 79\n | 84\n | 86\n | 82\n | 82\n | 82\n | 81\n | 76\n | 70\n | 77\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 131.3\n | 138.3\n | 159.2\n | 148.3\n | 151.8\n | 205.6\n | 246.8\n | 213.7\n | 197.7\n | 173.2\n | 139.1\n | 125.3\n | 2,030.3\n |\n| Source: Japan Meteorological Agency[84][85] |\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_lhPzB08pXf7UVb63hC5gz2ax","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

Delhi is also the centre of the National Capital Region, which is an \"interstate regional planning\" area created in 1985.[20][21] Delhi hosted the inaugural 1951 Asian Games, the 1982 Asian Games, the 1983 Non-Aligned Movement summit, the 2010 Men's Hockey World Cup, the 2010 Commonwealth Games, and the 2012 BRICS summit and was one of the major host cities of the 2011 Cricket World Cup and 2023 Cricket World Cup\n\n\n\n\n## Toponym[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Source 1: India Meteorological Department (sun 1971–2000);[80][81][82][83][84][85][86][87][88][89][90][91][92][93] Time and Date (dewpoints, 2005–2015)[94] Revised Rainfall data[95] |\n| Source 2: Tokyo Climate Center (mean temperatures 1991–2020);[96] Weather Atlas (UV Index)[97](Daylight)[98] |\n\n### Air pollution[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Environmental issues in Delhi and Air pollution in Delhi\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n78. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Average weather for New Delhi, India\".

In 2003, Delhi won the United States Department of Energy's first 'Clean Cities International Partner of the Year' award for its \"bold efforts to curb air pollution and support alternative fuel initiatives\".[123] The Delhi Metro has also been credited for significantly reducing air pollutants in the city.[124]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 2016, WHO downgraded Delhi to eleventh-worst in the urban air quality database.[100] According to one estimate, air pollution causes the death of about 10,500 people every year.[101][102][103] Air quality index is generally moderate (101–200) level between January and September, and then it drastically deteriorates to Very Poor (301–400), Severe (401–500) or Hazardous (500+) levels in three months between October and December,[104][105] due to various factors including stubble burning (a type of biomass burning), fire crackers burning during Diwali and cold weather.[106][107][108] During 2013–14, peak levels of fine particulate matter (PM) increased by about 44%, primarily due to high vehicular and industrial emissions, construction work and crop burning in adjoining states.[101][109][110][111] It has the highest level of the airborne particulate matter, PM2.5 considered most harmful to health, with 153 micrograms.[112]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n183. **^** Aparajita Ray (16 June 2016). \"Bengaluru retains second place after Delhi with most vehicles on roads\". *The Times of India*.

The city is bordered on its northern, western, and southern sides by the state of Haryana and to the east by that of Uttar Pradesh (UP). Two prominent features of the geography of Delhi are the Yamuna flood plains and the Delhi ridge. The Yamuna River was the historical boundary between Punjab and UP, and its flood plains provide fertile alluvial soil suitable for agriculture but are prone to recurrent floods. The Yamuna, a sacred river in Hinduism, is the only major river flowing through Delhi. The Hindon River separates Ghaziabad from the eastern part of Delhi. The Delhi ridge originates from the Aravalli Range in the south and encircles the west, northeast, and northwest parts of the city. It reaches a height of 318 m (1,043 ft) and is a dominant feature of the region.[74]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** (/ˈdɛli/; Hindi pronunciation: [ˈdɪlːiː] *dillī*; Punjabi pronunciation: [ˈdɪlːiː] *dillī*; Urdu pronunciation: [ˈdeɦliː] *dêhlī*, informally [ˈdɪlːiː] *dillī*),[12][13][14]\n2. **^** The elevated Delhi metro is seen above in Azadpur.[123][170]\n3. **^** Transfer stations are counted more than once.

Lying on both sides of the Yamuna river, but chiefly to the west, or beyond its right bank, Delhi shares borders with the state of Uttar Pradesh in the east and with the state of Haryana in the remaining directions. Delhi became a union territory on 1 November 1956 and the NCT in 1995.[15] The NCT covers an area of 1,484 square kilometres (573 sq mi).[5] According to the 2011 census, Delhi's city proper population was over 11 million,[6][16] while the NCT's population was about 16.8 million.[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHowever, according to several authors, most of these gains have been lost, especially due to stubble burning, a rise in the market share of diesel cars and a considerable decline in bus ridership.[125][126] According to CSE and System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), burning of agricultural waste in nearby Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh regions results in severe intensification of smog over Delhi.[127][128]\n\n\n\n## Civic administration[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Districts of Delhi, Neighbourhoods of Delhi, and List of towns in National Capital Territory of Delhi\n\n![](image)Logo of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi\n![](image)Districts of Delhi\nCurrently, the NCT of Delhi is made up of one division, 11 districts, 33 subdivisions, 59 census towns, and 300 villages.[129]\n\n\n\n![](image)Municipalities of Delhi\nOn the other way, the NCT of Delhi is divided into three municipalities.

The network consists of 10 colour-coded lines[193] serving 255 stations[c] with a total length of 348.12 kilometres (216.31 mi).[d] The system has a mix of underground, at-grade, and elevated stations using both broad-gauge and standard-gauge. All stations have escalators, lifts, and tactile tiles to guide the visually impaired from station entrances to trains. There are 18 designated parking sites at the Metro stations. In March 2010, DMRC partnered with Google India (through Google Transit) to provide train schedule and route information to mobile devices with Google Maps.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n230. **^** *Delhi: a portrait*, by Khushwant Singh, Raghu Rai, Published by Delhi Tourism Development Corp., 1983.

As of June 2005[update], it supplied 650 million gallons per day (MGD), whereas the estimated consumption requirement is 963 MGD.[154] The shortfall is met by private and public tube wells and hand pumps. At 240 MGD, the Bhakra storage is DJB's largest water source, followed by the Yamuna and Ganges rivers. Delhi's groundwater level is falling and its population density is increasing, so residents often encounter acute water shortage.[154] Research on Delhi suggests that up to half of the city's water use is unofficial groundwater.[155]  \nIn Delhi, daily domestic solid waste production is 8000 tonnes which is dumped at three landfill locations by MCD.[156] The daily domestic waste water production is 470 MGD and industrial waste water is 70 MGD.[157] A large portion of the sewage flows untreated into the Yamuna river.[157]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n162. **^** \"India begins $1.94b Delhi airport revamp\". *Daily Times*.

In 2003, Delhi won the United States Department of Energy's first 'Clean Cities International Partner of the Year' award for its \"bold efforts to curb air pollution and support alternative fuel initiatives\".[123] The Delhi Metro has also been credited for significantly reducing air pollutants in the city.[124]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 2016, WHO downgraded Delhi to eleventh-worst in the urban air quality database.[100] According to one estimate, air pollution causes the death of about 10,500 people every year.[101][102][103] Air quality index is generally moderate (101–200) level between January and September, and then it drastically deteriorates to Very Poor (301–400), Severe (401–500) or Hazardous (500+) levels in three months between October and December,[104][105] due to various factors including stubble burning (a type of biomass burning), fire crackers burning during Diwali and cold weather.[106][107][108] During 2013–14, peak levels of fine particulate matter (PM) increased by about 44%, primarily due to high vehicular and industrial emissions, construction work and crop burning in adjoining states.[101][109][110][111] It has the highest level of the airborne particulate matter, PM2.5 considered most harmful to health, with 153 micrograms.[112]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n183. **^** Aparajita Ray (16 June 2016). \"Bengaluru retains second place after Delhi with most vehicles on roads\". *The Times of India*.

The city is bordered on its northern, western, and southern sides by the state of Haryana and to the east by that of Uttar Pradesh (UP). Two prominent features of the geography of Delhi are the Yamuna flood plains and the Delhi ridge. The Yamuna River was the historical boundary between Punjab and UP, and its flood plains provide fertile alluvial soil suitable for agriculture but are prone to recurrent floods. The Yamuna, a sacred river in Hinduism, is the only major river flowing through Delhi. The Hindon River separates Ghaziabad from the eastern part of Delhi. The Delhi ridge originates from the Aravalli Range in the south and encircles the west, northeast, and northwest parts of the city. It reaches a height of 318 m (1,043 ft) and is a dominant feature of the region.[74]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** (/ˈdɛli/; Hindi pronunciation: [ˈdɪlːiː] *dillī*; Punjabi pronunciation: [ˈdɪlːiː] *dillī*; Urdu pronunciation: [ˈdeɦliː] *dêhlī*, informally [ˈdɪlːiː] *dillī*),[12][13][14]\n2. **^** The elevated Delhi metro is seen above in Azadpur.[123][170]\n3. **^** Transfer stations are counted more than once.

Lying on both sides of the Yamuna river, but chiefly to the west, or beyond its right bank, Delhi shares borders with the state of Uttar Pradesh in the east and with the state of Haryana in the remaining directions. Delhi became a union territory on 1 November 1956 and the NCT in 1995.[15] The NCT covers an area of 1,484 square kilometres (573 sq mi).[5] According to the 2011 census, Delhi's city proper population was over 11 million,[6][16] while the NCT's population was about 16.8 million.[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHowever, according to several authors, most of these gains have been lost, especially due to stubble burning, a rise in the market share of diesel cars and a considerable decline in bus ridership.[125][126] According to CSE and System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), burning of agricultural waste in nearby Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh regions results in severe intensification of smog over Delhi.[127][128]\n\n\n\n## Civic administration[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Districts of Delhi, Neighbourhoods of Delhi, and List of towns in National Capital Territory of Delhi\n\n![](image)Logo of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi\n![](image)Districts of Delhi\nCurrently, the NCT of Delhi is made up of one division, 11 districts, 33 subdivisions, 59 census towns, and 300 villages.[129]\n\n\n\n![](image)Municipalities of Delhi\nOn the other way, the NCT of Delhi is divided into three municipalities.

In 2015–16, the airport handled more than 48 million passengers,[161] making it the busiest airport in India and South Asia. Terminal 3, which cost ₹96.8 billion (US$1.2 billion) to construct between 2007 and 2010, handles an additional 37 million passengers annually.[162] In 2010, IGIA was conferred the 4th best airport award in the world in the 15–25 million category, by Airports Council International. The airport was rated as the *Best airport in the world* in the 25–40 million passengers category in 2015, by Airports Council International. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDelhi has the highest road density of 2103 km/100 km2 in India.[171] It is connected to other parts of India by five National Highways: NH 1, NH 2, NH 8, NH 10 and NH 24. The Delhi–Mumbai and Delhi–Kolkata prongs of the Golden Quadrilateral start from the city. The majority of the city's roads which are 60 ft. wide or above are maintained by the Public Works Department (PWD)[172] which is under the jurisdiction of the Government of Delhi while some are maintained by Delhi Development Authority and New Delhi Municipal Council[173] which are under the jurisdiction of the Government of India.

As of June 2005[update], it supplied 650 million gallons per day (MGD), whereas the estimated consumption requirement is 963 MGD.[154] The shortfall is met by private and public tube wells and hand pumps. At 240 MGD, the Bhakra storage is DJB's largest water source, followed by the Yamuna and Ganges rivers. Delhi's groundwater level is falling and its population density is increasing, so residents often encounter acute water shortage.[154] Research on Delhi suggests that up to half of the city's water use is unofficial groundwater.[155]  \nIn Delhi, daily domestic solid waste production is 8000 tonnes which is dumped at three landfill locations by MCD.[156] The daily domestic waste water production is 470 MGD and industrial waste water is 70 MGD.[157] A large portion of the sewage flows untreated into the Yamuna river.[157]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n162. **^** \"India begins $1.94b Delhi airport revamp\". *Daily Times*.

The original nuclei of the city are vertical, characterized by the presence of commercial buildings and services; And the peripheries are generally developed with two to four-story buildings – although such generalization certainly meets with exceptions in the fabric of the metropolis. Compared to other global cities (such as the island cities of New York City and Hong Kong), however, São Paulo is considered a \"low-rise building\" city. Its tallest buildings rarely reach forty stories, and the average residential building is twenty. Nevertheless, it is the fourth city in the world in quantity of buildings, according to the page specialized in research of data on buildings *Emporis Buildings*,[174] besides possessing what was considered until 2014 the tallest skyscraper of the country, the Mirante do Vale, also known as *Palácio Zarzur Kogan*, with 170 meters of height and 51 floors.[175]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n11. **^** \"Latin American cities Ranking by GDP\" (PDF) (in Spanish).

In an assessment carried out by the WHO among over a thousand cities around the world in 2011, the city of São Paulo was ranked 268th among the most polluted, with an average rate of 38 micrograms per cubic meter, a rate well above the limit imposed by the organization, but lower than in other Brazilian cities, such as Rio de Janeiro (64 micrograms per cubic meter).[48] A 2013 study found that air pollution in the city causes more deaths than traffic accidents.[49][50]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**São Paulo** (/ˌsaʊ ˈpaʊloʊ/, Portuguese: [sɐ̃w̃ ˈpawlu] ⓘ; Portuguese for 'Saint Paul') is the most populous city in Brazil and the capital of the state of São Paulo. Listed by the GaWC as an alpha global city, São Paulo is the most populous city outside of Asia and the world's 4th largest city proper by population. Additionally, São Paulo is the largest Portuguese-speaking city in the world. It exerts strong international influences in commerce, finance, arts and entertainment.[8] The city's name honors the Apostle, Saint Paul of Tarsus. The city's metropolitan area, the Greater São Paulo, ranks as the most populous in Brazil and the 12th most populous on Earth. The process of conurbation between the metropolitan areas around the Greater São Paulo (Campinas, Santos, Jundiaí, Sorocaba and São José dos Campos) created the São Paulo Macrometropolis,[9] a megalopolis with more than 30 million inhabitants, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAccording to the International Congress & Convention Association, São Paulo ranks first among the cities that host international events in Americas and the 12th in the world, after Vienna, Paris, Barcelona, Singapore, Berlin, Budapest, Amsterdam, Stockholm, Seoul, Lisbon, and Copenhagen.[167] According to a study by MasterCard in 130 cities around the world, São Paulo was the third most visited destination in Latin America (behind Mexico City and Buenos Aires) with 2.4 million foreign travelers, who spent US$2.9 billion in 2013 (the highest among the cities in the region). In 2014, CNN ranked nightlife São Paulo as the fourth best in the world, behind New York City, Berlin and Ibiza, in Spain.[168]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  • Macrometropolis | 33,652,991[4] |\n| Demonym | Paulistan |\n| Time zone | UTC– 03:00 (BRT) |\n| Postal Code (CEP) | 01000-000\n |\n| Area code | +55 11 |\n| **HDI** (2010) | 0.805 – very high[5] |\n| PPP (2021) | US$589 billion[6] (1st) |\n| Per Capita | US$47,484[6] (1st) |\n| Nominal (2021) | US$278 billion[7] (1st) |\n| Per Capita | US$22,404[6] (1st) |\n| Primary Airport | São Paulo–Guarulhos International Airport |\n| Secondary Airports | São Paulo–Congonhas AirportCampo de Marte Airport |\n| Interstates | ![](image) ![](image) ![](image) |\n| Rapid Transit | São Paulo Metro |\n| Commuter Rail | CPTM |\n| Website | www.capital.sp.gov.br |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe per capita income for the city was R$32,493 in 2008.[151] According to Mercer's 2011 city rankings of cost of living for expatriate employees, São Paulo is now among the ten most expensive cities in the world, ranking 10th in 2011, up from 21st in 2010 and ahead of London, Paris, Milan and New York City.[152][153]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)\nB3, the largest stock exchange of Latin America by market capitalization\n![](image)\nPaulista Avenue, the headquarters of many financial and cultural institutions\n![](image)\nPeople's Park in Itaim Bibi, in the region of the Brigadeiro Faria Lima Avenue\n![](image)\nUnited Nations Business Center at Brooklin Novo\n![](image)\nOscar Freire St., one of the most luxurious streets in the world[137]\n\nSão Paulo is considered the \"financial capital of Brazil\", as it is the location for the headquarters of major corporations and of banks and financial institutions.

By 1960 it had surpassed that of Rio de Janeiro, making it Brazil's most populous city. By this time, the urbanized area of São Paulo had extended beyond the boundaries of the municipality proper into neighboring municipalities, making it a metropolitan area with a population of 4.6 million. Population growth has continued since 1960, although the rate of growth has slowed.[85]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n173. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"A sustentabilidade urbana\". O Estado de S.

Once a city with a strong industrial character, São Paulo's economy has followed the global trend of shifting to the tertiary sector of the economy, focusing on services. The city is unique among Brazilian cities for its large number of foreign corporations.[147]\n\n\n63% of all the international companies with business in Brazil have their head offices in São Paulo. São Paulo has one of the largest concentrations of German businesses worldwide[148] and is the largest Swedish industrial hub alongside Gothenburg.[149]\n\n\nSão Paulo ranked second after New York in FDi magazine's bi-annual ranking of Cities of the Future 2013–14 in the Americas, and was named the Latin American City of the Future 2013–14, overtaking Santiago de Chile, the first city in the previous ranking. Santiago now ranks second, followed by Rio de Janeiro.[150]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn such occasions daily high temperatures may not surpass 20 °C (68 °F), accompanied by lows often below 15 °C (59 °F), however, summer can be extremely hot when a heat wave hits the city followed by temperatures around 34 °C (93 °F), but in places with greater skyscraper density and less tree cover, the temperature can feel like 39 °C (102 °F), as on Paulista Avenue for example. In the summer of 2014, São Paulo was affected by a heat wave that lasted for almost 4 weeks with highs above 30 °C (86 °F), peaking on 36 °C (97 °F). Secondary to deforestation, groundwater pollution, and climate change, São Paulo is increasingly susceptible to drought and water shortages.[66]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n61. **^** \"Revista Galileu – Quando a neve chega ao Brasil\". *revistagalileu.globo.com*.

The city has 62 cuisines across 12,000 restaurants.[169] During the 10th International Congress of Gastronomy, Hospitality and Tourism (Cihat) conducted in 1997, the city received the title of \"World Gastronomy Capital\" from a commission formed by 43 nations' representatives.[170]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nPanoramic view of the city at night from Ibirapuera Park\n\n## Urban infrastructure[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe problem of balanced water supply for the city - and for the metropolis, in general - is also a worrying issue: São Paulo has few sources of water in its own perimeter, having to seek it in distant hydrographic basins. The problem of water pollution is also aggravated by the irregular occupation of watershed areas, caused by urban expansion, driven by the difficulty of access to land and housing in central areas by the low-income population[55] and associated with real estate speculation and precariousness in new subdivisions. With this, there is also an overvaluation of individual transport over public transport – leading to the current rate of more than one vehicle for every two inhabitants and aggravating the problem of environmental pollution.[56]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2009, São Paulo had 2,300 hectares (5,700 acres) of green area, less than 1.5% of the city's area[42] and below the 12 square metres (130 sq ft) per inhabitant recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO).[43] About 21% of the municipality's area is covered by green areas, including ecological reserves (2010 data).[44][45]\n\n\nIn the municipality it is possible to observe forest birds that usually appear in the spring, due to the belt of native forest that still surrounds the metropolitan region. Species such as the rufous-bellied thrush, golden-chevroned tanager, great kiskadee and hummingbird are the most common. Despite the intense pollution, the main rivers of the city, the Tietê and the Pinheiros, shelter several species of animals such as capybaras, hawks, southern lapwings, herons and nutrias. Other species found in the municipality are the gray brocket, howler monkey, green-billed toucan and the Amazonian umbrellabird.[46]\n\n\n\n### Environment[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n187. **^** \"A Melting Pot in the southern hemisphere\". *The Jakarta Post*. 17 April 2011.

The population of São Paulo was 52.6% female and 47.4% male.[89] The census found 6,824,668 White people (60.6%), 3,433,218 Pardo (multiracial) people (30.5%), 736,083 Black people (6.5%), 246,244 Asian people (2.2%) and 21,318 Amerindian people (0.2%).[89]\n\n\n\n### Immigration and migration[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Immigration to Brazil\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSuch tissue heterogeneity, however, is not as predictable as the generic model can make us imagine. Some central regions of the city began to concentrate indigents, drug trafficking, street vending and prostitution, which encouraged the creation of new socio-economic centralities. The characterization of each region of the city also underwent several changes throughout the 20th century. With the relocation of industries to other cities or states, several areas that once housed factory sheds have become commercial or even residential areas.[176]\n\n\nSão Paulo has a history of actions, projects and plans related to urban planning that can be traced to the governments of Antonio da Silva Prado, Baron Duprat, Washington and Luis Francisco Prestes Maia. However, in general, the city was formed during the 20th century, growing from village to metropolis through a series of informal processes and irregular urban sprawl.[177]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAs a result, favelas and precarious tenements (cortiços) appeared.[183] These housing types were often closer to the city's center: favelas could sprawl in any unused terrain (often dangerous or unsanitary) and decaying or abandoned buildings for tenements were abundant inside the city. Favelas went back into the urban perimeter, occupying the small lots not yet occupied by urbanization – alongside polluted rivers, railways, or between bridges.[184] By 1993, 19.8% of São Paulo's population lived in favelas, compared to 5.2% in 1980.[185] Today, it is estimated that 2.1 million Paulistas live in favelas, which represents about 11% of the metropolitan area's population.[186]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nPanoramic view of Central Zone of São Paulo from Italy Building\n\n### Transport[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Transport in São Paulo and Transport in Brazil\n\n#### Roads[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nBandeirantes Highway/SP-348\n![](image)\nMario Covas Beltway\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n88. **^** \"São Paulo is the largest city in the portuguese speaking world\".

With the First and Second World Wars and the Great Depression, coffee exports to the United States and Europe were heavily affected, forcing the rich coffee growers to invest in the industrial activities that would make São Paulo the largest industrial center in Brazil. The new job vacancies contributed to attract a significant number of immigrants (mainly from Italy)[171] and migrants, especially from the Northeastern states.[172] From a population of only 32.000 people in 1880, São Paulo now had 8.5 million inhabitants in 1980. The rapid population growth has brought many problems for the city.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe city has the most diverse Protestant or Reformed creeds, such as the Evangelical Community of Our Land, Maranatha Christian Church, Lutheran Church, Presbyterian Church, Methodist Church, Anglican Episcopal Church, Baptist churches, Assembly Church of God, The Seventh-day Adventist Church, the World Church of God's Power, the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God, the Christian Congregation in Brazil, among others, as well as Christians of various denominations.[111] \n\n\n\n### Public security[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\"Temperatura Máxima Mensal e Anual (°C)\". *Normais Climatológicas do Brasil 1991–2020* (in Portuguese).

The original nuclei of the city are vertical, characterized by the presence of commercial buildings and services; And the peripheries are generally developed with two to four-story buildings – although such generalization certainly meets with exceptions in the fabric of the metropolis. Compared to other global cities (such as the island cities of New York City and Hong Kong), however, São Paulo is considered a \"low-rise building\" city. Its tallest buildings rarely reach forty stories, and the average residential building is twenty. Nevertheless, it is the fourth city in the world in quantity of buildings, according to the page specialized in research of data on buildings *Emporis Buildings*,[174] besides possessing what was considered until 2014 the tallest skyscraper of the country, the Mirante do Vale, also known as *Palácio Zarzur Kogan*, with 170 meters of height and 51 floors.[175]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n11. **^** \"Latin American cities Ranking by GDP\" (PDF) (in Spanish).

Once a city with a strong industrial character, São Paulo's economy has followed the global trend of shifting to the tertiary sector of the economy, focusing on services. The city is unique among Brazilian cities for its large number of foreign corporations.[147]\n\n\n63% of all the international companies with business in Brazil have their head offices in São Paulo. São Paulo has one of the largest concentrations of German businesses worldwide[148] and is the largest Swedish industrial hub alongside Gothenburg.[149]\n\n\nSão Paulo ranked second after New York in FDi magazine's bi-annual ranking of Cities of the Future 2013–14 in the Americas, and was named the Latin American City of the Future 2013–14, overtaking Santiago de Chile, the first city in the previous ranking. Santiago now ranks second, followed by Rio de Janeiro.[150]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn such occasions daily high temperatures may not surpass 20 °C (68 °F), accompanied by lows often below 15 °C (59 °F), however, summer can be extremely hot when a heat wave hits the city followed by temperatures around 34 °C (93 °F), but in places with greater skyscraper density and less tree cover, the temperature can feel like 39 °C (102 °F), as on Paulista Avenue for example. In the summer of 2014, São Paulo was affected by a heat wave that lasted for almost 4 weeks with highs above 30 °C (86 °F), peaking on 36 °C (97 °F). Secondary to deforestation, groundwater pollution, and climate change, São Paulo is increasingly susceptible to drought and water shortages.[66]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n61. **^** \"Revista Galileu – Quando a neve chega ao Brasil\". *revistagalileu.globo.com*.

The city has 62 cuisines across 12,000 restaurants.[169] During the 10th International Congress of Gastronomy, Hospitality and Tourism (Cihat) conducted in 1997, the city received the title of \"World Gastronomy Capital\" from a commission formed by 43 nations' representatives.[170]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nPanoramic view of the city at night from Ibirapuera Park\n\n## Urban infrastructure[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe problem of balanced water supply for the city - and for the metropolis, in general - is also a worrying issue: São Paulo has few sources of water in its own perimeter, having to seek it in distant hydrographic basins. The problem of water pollution is also aggravated by the irregular occupation of watershed areas, caused by urban expansion, driven by the difficulty of access to land and housing in central areas by the low-income population[55] and associated with real estate speculation and precariousness in new subdivisions. With this, there is also an overvaluation of individual transport over public transport – leading to the current rate of more than one vehicle for every two inhabitants and aggravating the problem of environmental pollution.[56]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2009, São Paulo had 2,300 hectares (5,700 acres) of green area, less than 1.5% of the city's area[42] and below the 12 square metres (130 sq ft) per inhabitant recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO).[43] About 21% of the municipality's area is covered by green areas, including ecological reserves (2010 data).[44][45]\n\n\nIn the municipality it is possible to observe forest birds that usually appear in the spring, due to the belt of native forest that still surrounds the metropolitan region. Species such as the rufous-bellied thrush, golden-chevroned tanager, great kiskadee and hummingbird are the most common. Despite the intense pollution, the main rivers of the city, the Tietê and the Pinheiros, shelter several species of animals such as capybaras, hawks, southern lapwings, herons and nutrias. Other species found in the municipality are the gray brocket, howler monkey, green-billed toucan and the Amazonian umbrellabird.[46]\n\n\n\n### Environment[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n187. **^** \"A Melting Pot in the southern hemisphere\". *The Jakarta Post*. 17 April 2011.

The city has 1,500 bank branches and 70 shopping malls.[144]\n\n\nAs of 2014[update], São Paulo is the third largest exporting municipality in Brazil after Parauapebas, PA and Rio de Janeiro, RJ. In that year São Paulo's exported goods totaled $7.32B (USD) or 3.02% of Brazil's total exports. The top five commodities exported by São Paulo are soybean (21%), raw sugar (19%), coffee (6.5%), sulfate chemical wood pulp (5.6%), and corn (4.4%).[145]\n\n\nThe São Paulo Stock Exchange (BM&F Bovespa) is Brazil's official stock and bond exchange.

The city consumes an average of 221 liters of water/inhabitant/day while the UN recommends the consumption of 110 liters/day. The water loss is 30.8%. However, between 11 and 12.8% of households do not have a sewage system, depositing waste in pits and ditches. Sixty percent of the sewage collected is treated. According to data from IBGE and Eletropaulo, the electricity grid serves almost 100% of households. The fixed telephony network is still precarious, with coverage of 67.2%. Household garbage collection covers all regions of the municipality but is still insufficient, reaching around 94% of the demand in districts such as Parelheiros and Perus. About 80% of the garbage produced daily by Paulistas is exported to other cities, such as Caieiras and Guarulhos.[173] Recycling accounts for about 1% of the 15,000 metric tons of waste produced daily.[173]\n\n\n\n### Urban planning[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n193. **^** \"UrbanRail.Net > South America > Brazil > São Paulo Metro\". *www.urbanrail.net*.

The population of São Paulo was 52.6% female and 47.4% male.[89] The census found 6,824,668 White people (60.6%), 3,433,218 Pardo (multiracial) people (30.5%), 736,083 Black people (6.5%), 246,244 Asian people (2.2%) and 21,318 Amerindian people (0.2%).[89]\n\n\n\n### Immigration and migration[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Immigration to Brazil\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSuch tissue heterogeneity, however, is not as predictable as the generic model can make us imagine. Some central regions of the city began to concentrate indigents, drug trafficking, street vending and prostitution, which encouraged the creation of new socio-economic centralities. The characterization of each region of the city also underwent several changes throughout the 20th century. With the relocation of industries to other cities or states, several areas that once housed factory sheds have become commercial or even residential areas.[176]\n\n\nSão Paulo has a history of actions, projects and plans related to urban planning that can be traced to the governments of Antonio da Silva Prado, Baron Duprat, Washington and Luis Francisco Prestes Maia. However, in general, the city was formed during the 20th century, growing from village to metropolis through a series of informal processes and irregular urban sprawl.[177]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAs a result, favelas and precarious tenements (cortiços) appeared.[183] These housing types were often closer to the city's center: favelas could sprawl in any unused terrain (often dangerous or unsanitary) and decaying or abandoned buildings for tenements were abundant inside the city. Favelas went back into the urban perimeter, occupying the small lots not yet occupied by urbanization – alongside polluted rivers, railways, or between bridges.[184] By 1993, 19.8% of São Paulo's population lived in favelas, compared to 5.2% in 1980.[185] Today, it is estimated that 2.1 million Paulistas live in favelas, which represents about 11% of the metropolitan area's population.[186]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nPanoramic view of Central Zone of São Paulo from Italy Building\n\n### Transport[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Transport in São Paulo and Transport in Brazil\n\n#### Roads[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nBandeirantes Highway/SP-348\n![](image)\nMario Covas Beltway\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n88. **^** \"São Paulo is the largest city in the portuguese speaking world\".

In the early twentieth century, Italian and its dialects were spoken almost as much as Portuguese in the city, which influenced the formation of the São Paulo dialect of today. Six thousand pizzerias are producing about a million pizzas a day.

In Brazil, the city of São Paulo has the largest number of doctors who can speak more than one language, which in this case is Portuguese, with the secondary languages predominantly are English and Spanish.[128]\n\n\nThe private health care sector is very large and most of Brazil's best hospitals are in the city.

In 2007, residents in the top twelve percent of GDP per capita holders in the city had a mean disposable income of US$98,517. The high spending power of Mexico City inhabitants makes the city attractive for companies offering prestige and luxury goods. According to a 2009 study conducted by PwC, Mexico City had a GDP of $390 billion, ranking it as the eighth richest city in the world and the richest in Latin America.[164] In 2009, Mexico City alone would rank as the 30th largest economy in the world.[165]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n106. **^** Lafregua, J; Gutierrez, A; Aguilar E; Aparicio J; Mejia R; Santillan O; Suarez MA; Preciado M (2003). \"Balance hídrico del Valle de Mexico\" (PDF).

Nonetheless, the annual rate of growth of the Metropolitan Area of Mexico City is much lower than that of other large urban agglomerations in Mexico,[114] a phenomenon most likely attributable to the environmental policy of decentralization.

The megalopolis as defined by the Environmental Commission of the Megalopolis (*CAMe*) covers Mexico City and the states of Mexico, Hidalgo, Puebla, Tlaxcala, Morelos, and since 2019, Querétaro,[116] thus encompassing the metropolitan areas of Mexico City, Puebla, Querétaro, Toluca, Cuernavaca, Pachuca, and others.[117]\n\n\n\n#### Growth[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGreater Mexico City was the fastest growing metropolitan area in the country until the late 1980s. Since then, government policies have supported decentralization with the aim of reducing pollution in Greater Mexico City. While still growing, the annual rate of growth has decreased and is lower than that of Greater Guadalajara and Greater Monterrey.[114]\n\n\nThe net migration rate of Mexico City proper from 1995 to 2000 was negative,[118] which implies that residents are moving to the suburbs of the metropolitan area, or to other states of Mexico. In addition, some inner suburbs are losing population to outer suburbs, indicating the continuing expansion of Greater Mexico City.\n\n\n\n![](image)\nPanorama of Mexico City from Torre Latinoamericana\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Air pollution over Mexico City.

By 2014 carbon monoxide pollution had dropped drastically, while sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide were at levels about a third of those in 1992. The levels of signature pollutants in Mexico City are similar to those of Los Angeles.[83] Despite the cleanup, the metropolitan area is still the most ozone-polluted part of the country, with ozone levels 2.5 times beyond WHO-defined safe limits.[84]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Human Development Index report of 2005[150] shows that there were three boroughs with a very high Human Development Index, 12 with a high HDI value (9 above .85), and one with a medium HDI value (almost high). Benito Juárez borough had the highest HDI of the country (0.9510) followed by Miguel Hidalgo, which came up fourth nationally with an HDI of (0.9189), and Coyoacán was fifth nationally, with an HDI of (0.9169). Cuajimalpa (15th), Cuauhtémoc (23rd), and Azcapotzalco (25th) also had very high values of 0.8994, 0.8922, and 0.8915, respectively.[150]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Satellite image of Mexico City\nMexico City is located in the Valley of Mexico, sometimes called the Basin of Mexico. This valley is located in the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt in the high plateaus of south-central Mexico.[77][78]\n\n\nIt has a minimum altitude of 2,200 meters (7,200 feet) above sea level and is surrounded by mountains and volcanoes that reach elevations of over 5,000 meters (16,000 feet).[79] This valley has no natural drainage outlet for the waters that flow from the mountainsides, making the city vulnerable to flooding. Drainage was engineered through the use of canals and tunnels starting in the 17th century.[77][79]\n\n\nMexico City primarily rests on what was Lake Texcoco.[77] Seismic activity is frequent there.[80] Lake Texcoco was drained starting from the 17th century. Although none of the lake waters remain, the city rests on the lake bed's heavily saturated clay. This soft base is collapsing due to the over-extraction of groundwater, called *groundwater-related subsidence*.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n18. **^** Parish Flannery, Nathaniel (23 December 2013). \"Mexico City Is Focusing on Tech Sector Development\". *Forbes*.

The lower region of the valley receives less rainfall than the upper regions of the south; the lower boroughs of Iztapalapa, Iztacalco, Venustiano Carranza and the east portion of Gustavo A. Madero are usually drier and warmer than the upper southern boroughs of Tlalpan and Milpa Alta, a mountainous region of pine and oak trees known as the range of Ajusco. The average annual temperature varies from 12 to 16 °C (54 to 61 °F), depending on the altitude of the borough. The temperature is rarely below 3 °C (37 °F) or above 30 °C (86 °F).[97] At the Tacubaya observatory, the lowest temperature ever registered was −4.4 °C (24 °F) on 13 February 1960, and the highest temperature on record was 33.9 °C (93 °F) on 9 May 1998.[98] Overall precipitation is heavily concentrated in the summer months, and includes dense hail.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1969 the Mexico City Metro was inaugurated.[46] Explosive growth in the population of the city started in the 1960s, with the population overflowing the boundaries of the Federal District into the neighboring State of Mexico, especially to the north, northwest, and northeast. Between 1960 and 1980 the city's population more than doubled to nearly 9 million.[53]\n\n\nIn 1980 half of all the industrial jobs in Mexico were located in Mexico City. Under relentless growth, the Mexico City government could barely keep up with services. Villagers from the countryside who continued to pour into the city to escape poverty only compounded the city's problems. With no housing available, they took over lands surrounding the city, creating huge shantytowns that extended for many miles.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n32. **^** Alberto Dallal. \"La Ciudad de México: el espectáculo más grande del mundo\". *Electronic magazine Imágenes of the Institute of Aesthetic Research of the National Autonomous University of Mexico*.

When the Federal District was created in 1824, the urban area of Mexico City extended approximately to the area of today's Cuauhtémoc borough. At the beginning of the 20th century, the *elites* began migrating to the south and west and soon the small towns of Mixcoac and San Ángel were incorporated by the growing conurbation. According to the 1921 census, 54.78% of the city's population was considered Mestizo (Indigenous mixed with European), 22.79% considered European, and 18.74% considered Indigenous.[111] This was the last Mexican Census which asked people to self-identify with a heritage other than Amerindian. In 1921, Mexico City had less than one million inhabitants.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Mexico City in 1690.

Due to the limited non-urbanized space at the south—most of which is protected through environmental laws—the contribution of Mexico City in agriculture is the smallest of all federal entities in the country.[162] The economic reforms of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari had a tremendous effect on the city, as a number of businesses, including banks and airlines, were privatized. He also signed the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). This led to decentralization[166] and a shift in Mexico City's economic base, from manufacturing to services, as most factories moved away to either the State of Mexico, or more commonly to the northern border. By contrast, corporate office buildings set their base in the city.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* *The Valley, Anguilla (UK)*\n* Washington, D.C., United States\n |\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n![](image) Mexican state capitals\n |\n| --- |\n| * Aguascalientes (Aguascalientes)\n* Mexicali (Baja California)\n* La Paz (Baja California Sur)\n* Campeche (Campeche)\n* Tuxtla Gutiérrez (Chiapas)\n* Chihuahua (Chihuahua)\n* Saltillo (Coahuila)\n* Colima (Colima)\n* Mexico City\n* Durango (Durango)\n* Guanajuato (Guanajuato)\n* Chilpancingo (Guerrero)\n* Pachuca (Hidalgo)\n* Guadalajara (Jalisco)\n* Toluca (State of Mexico)\n* Morelia (Michoacán)\n* Cuernavaca (Morelos)\n* Tepic (Nayarit)\n* Monterrey (Nuevo León)\n* Oaxaca (Oaxaca)\n* Puebla (Puebla)\n* Querétaro (Querétaro)\n* Chetumal (Quintana Roo)\n* San Luis Potosí (San Luis Potosí)\n* Culiacán (Sinaloa)\n* Hermosillo (Sonora)\n* Villahermosa (Tabasco)\n* Ciudad Victoria (Tamaulipas)\n* Tlaxcala (Tlaxcala)\n* Xalapa (Veracruz)\n* Mérida (Yucatán)\n* Zacatecas (Zacatecas)\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOther sports facilities in Mexico City are the Palacio de los Deportes indoor arena, Francisco Márquez Olympic Swimming Pool, the Hipódromo de Las Américas, the Agustin Melgar Olympic Velodrome, and venues for equestrianism and horse racing, ice hockey, rugby, American-style football, baseball, and basketball.

But it was English politician Charles Latrobe who really penned the following: \"... look at their works: the moles, aqueducts, churches, roads—and the luxurious *City of Palaces* which has risen from the clay-builts ruins of Tenochtitlan...\", on page 84 of the Letter V of *The Rambler in Mexico*.[31]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSnow falls in the city very rarely, although somewhat more often in nearby mountain tops. Throughout its history, the Central Valley of Mexico was accustomed to having several snowfalls per decade (including a period between 1878 and 1895 in which every single year—except 1880—recorded snowfalls[99]) mostly lake-effect snow. The effects of the draining of Lake Texcoco and global warming have greatly reduced snowfalls after the snow flurries of 12 February 1907.[100] Since 1908, snow has only fallen three times, snow on 14 February 1920;[101] snow flurries on 14 March 1940;[102] and on 12 January 1967, when 8 centimeters (3 in) of snow fell on the city, the most on record.[103] The 1967 snowstorm coincided with the operation of *Deep Drainage System* that resulted in the total draining of what was left of Lake Texcoco.[99][104] After the disappearance of Lake Texcoco, snow has never fallen again over Mexico City.[99] The region of the Valley of Mexico receives anti-cyclonic systems. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n## External links[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image) Media related to Mexico City at Wikimedia Commons\n* ![](image) Geographic data related to Mexico City at OpenStreetMap\n* Mexico City Government (in Spanish)\n* Mexico City Tourism Ministry Archived 30 July 2013 at the Wayback Machine (in Spanish)\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nMexico City\n |\n| --- |\n| Topics | * Administrative divisions\n\t+ Boroughs\n\t+ Neighborhoods\n\t+ Barrios Mágicos\n* Airport\n* Architecture\n\t+ Archaeological sites\n\t+ Colonial government and civil buildings\n\t+ Colonial churches\n\t+ Skyscrapers\n* Downtown\n* Folk art\n* Gentrification\n* Government\n\t+ Constituent Assembly\n\t+ Federal District buildings\n\t+ Heads of government\n\t+ Law enforcement\n\t+ Legislative Assembly\n* History\n\t+ Timeline\n* Metropolitan area\n* Parking\n* Pollution\n* Street vendors\n* Transport\n* Water management\n | ![Coat of arms of Mexico City](image)\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nWorld Heritage Sites in Mexico\n |\n| --- |\n| North West | * Archaeological Zone of Paquimé, Casas Grandes\n* El Pinacate y Gran Desierto de Altar Biosphere Reserve\n* Islands and Protected Areas of the Gulf of California1\n* Rock Paintings of Sierra de San Francisco\n* Whale Sanctuary of El Vizcaino\n |\n| North Central | * Camino Real de Tierra Adentro\n* Franciscan Missions in the Sierra Gorda of Querétaro\n* Historic Centre of Zacatecas\n* Historic Monuments Zone of Querétaro\n* Historic Town of Guanajuato and Adjacent Mines\n* Protected town of San Miguel de Allende and the Sanctuary of Jesús Nazareno de Atotonilco\n |\n| West | * Agave Landscape and Ancient Industrial Facilities of Tequila\n* Revillagigedo Archipelago\n* Historic Centre of Morelia\n* Hospicio Cabañas, Guadalajara\n* Islands and Protected Areas of the Gulf of California1\n* Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve1\n |\n| East | * Earliest 16th-century monasteries on the slopes of Popocatépetl1\n* Pre-Hispanic City of El Tajín\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Zócalo/Tenochtitlan metro station\n |\n| Other | * Barrio Chino\n* Chapultepec aqueduct\n* Edificio Miguel E.

Designed by the most prestigious architects of the era, including Mario Pani, Eugenio Peschard, and Enrique del Moral, the buildings feature murals by artists Diego Rivera, David Alfaro Siqueiros, and José Chávez Morado. It has since been recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.[71]\n\n\nIn the 1950s Mexico City began to grow upwards, with the Torre Latinoamericana becoming the city's first skyscraper.[46] The 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City are memorable because they triggered one of the earliest anti-Olympic protests.[72]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Mexico City Metro\nMain article: Mexico City Metro\n\nMexico City is served by the Mexico City Metro, a 225.9 km (140 mi) metro system, which is the largest in Latin America. The first portions were opened in 1969 and it has expanded to 12 lines with 195 stations, transporting 4.4 million people every day.[176]\n\n\n\n### Tren Suburbano[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tren Suburbano\n\nA suburban rail system, the Tren Suburbano serves the metropolitan area, beyond the reach of the metro, with one line serving to municipalities such as Tlalnepantla and Cuautitlán Izcalli, but with future lines planned to serve e.g. Chalco and La Paz.\n\n\nElectric transport other than the metro also exists, in the form of several Mexico City trolleybus routes and the Xochimilco Light Rail line, both of which are operated by Servicio de Transportes Eléctricos. The central area's last streetcar line (tramway, or *tranvía*) closed in 1979.\n\n\n\n### Bus[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Mexico City Metrobús and Red de Transporte de Pasajeros\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBetween 2000 and 2004 an average of 478 crimes were reported each day in Mexico City; however, the actual crime rate is thought to be much higher \"since most people are reluctant to report crime\".[151] Under policies enacted by Mayor Marcelo Ebrard between 2009 and 2011, Mexico City underwent a major security upgrade with violent and petty crime rates both falling significantly despite the rise in violent crime in other parts of the country. Some of the policies enacted included the installation of 11,000 security cameras around the city and a very large expansion of the police force. Mexico City has one of the world's highest police officer-to-resident ratios, with one uniformed officer per 100 citizens.[152] Since 1997 the prison population has increased by more than 500%.[153] Political scientist Markus-Michael Müller argues that mostly informal street vendors are hit by these measures. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe city grew as the population did, coming up against the lake's waters. As the depth of the lake water fluctuated, Mexico City was subject to periodic flooding. A major labor draft, the *desagüe*, compelled thousands of indigenous over the colonial period to work on infrastructure to prevent flooding. Floods were not only an inconvenience but also a health hazard, since during flood periods human waste polluted the city's streets. By draining the area, the mosquito population dropped as did the frequency of the diseases they spread. However, draining the wetlands also changed the habitat for fish and birds and the areas accessible for indigenous cultivation close to the capital.[58] The 16th century saw a proliferation of churches, many of which can still be seen today in the historic center.[53]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe most recognizable icon of Mexico City is the golden Angel of Independence on the wide, elegant avenue Paseo de la Reforma, modeled by the order of the Emperor Maximilian of Mexico after the Champs-Élysées in Paris. This avenue was designed over the Americas' oldest known major roadway in the 19th century to connect the National Palace (seat of government) with the Castle of Chapultepec, the imperial residence. Today, this avenue is an important financial district in which the Mexican Stock Exchange and several corporate headquarters are located. Another important avenue is the Avenida de los Insurgentes, which extends 28.8 km (17.9 mi) and is one of the longest single avenues in the world.\n\n\nChapultepec Park houses the Chapultepec Castle, now a museum on a hill that overlooks the park and its numerous museums, monuments and the national zoo and the National Museum of Anthropology (which houses the Aztec Calendar Stone). \n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nArchitects Teodoro González de León and Alberto Kalach along with a group of Mexican urbanists, engineers and biologists have developed the project plan for *Recovering the City of Lakes*. If approved by the government the project will contribute to the supply of water from natural sources to the Valley of Mexico, the creation of new natural spaces, a great improvement in air quality, and greater population establishment planning.\n\n\n\n### Pollution[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Air pollution in Mexico City\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nSummer Olympic Games host cities\n |\n| --- |\n| * **1896:** ![Greece](image) Athens\n* **1900:** ![France](image) Paris\n* **1904:** ![United States](image) St. Louis\n* **1908:** ![United Kingdom](image) London\n* **1912:** ![Sweden](image) Stockholm\n* **1916:** *None*[c1]\n* **1920:** ![Belgium](image) Antwerp\n* **1924:** ![France](image) Paris\n* **1928:** ![Netherlands](image) Amsterdam\n* **1932:** ![United States](image) Los Angeles\n* **1936:** ![Germany](image) Berlin\n* **1940:** *None*[c2]\n* **1944:** *None*[c2]\n* **1948:** ![United Kingdom](image) London\n* **1952:** ![Finland](image) Helsinki\n* **1956:** ![Australia](image) Melbourne\n* **1960:** ![Italy](image) Rome\n* **1964:** ![Japan](image) Tokyo\n* **1968:** ![Mexico](image) Mexico City\n* **1972:** ![West Germany](image) Munich\n* **1976:** ![Canada](image) Montreal\n* **1980:** ![Soviet Union](image) Moscow\n* **1984:** ![United States](image) Los Angeles\n* **1988:** ![South Korea](image) Seoul\n* **1992:** ![Spain](image) Barcelona\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHe sees punishment \"related to the growing politicization of security and crime issues and the resulting criminalization of the people living at the margins of urban society, in particular those who work in the city's informal economy\".[153]\n\n\nIn 2016, the incidence of femicides was 3.2 per 100 000 inhabitants, the national average being 4.2.[154] A 2015 city government report found that two of three women over the age of 15 in the capital suffered some form of violence.[155] In addition to street harassment, one of the places where women in Mexico City are subjected to violence is on and around public transport. Annually the Metro of Mexico City receives 300 complaints of sexual harassment.[156] While the violence against women in Mexico City is rising, there is still a large number of incidents of kidnappings and killings that go undetected and unreported due to the corruption in the police department.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### International relations[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Mexico City International Airport\nMexico City International Airport is Mexico City's primary airport (IATA Airport Code: MEX), and serves as the hub of Aeroméxico (Skyteam).

(The Mexican–American War had just been fought.) The last changes to the limits of Mexico City were made between 1898 and 1902, reducing the area to the current 1,479 km2 (571 sq mi) by adjusting the southern border with the state of Morelos. By that time, the total number of municipalities within Mexico City was twenty-two. In 1941, the General Anaya borough was merged with the Central Department, which was then renamed \"Mexico City\" (thus reviving the name but not the autonomous municipality).

The Legislative Assembly expanded provisions on abortions, becoming the first federal entity to expand abortion in Mexico beyond cases of rape and economic reasons, to permit it at the choice of the mother before the 12th week of pregnancy.[146] In December 2009, the then Federal District became the first city in Latin America and one of very few in the world to legalize same-sex marriage.[147]\n\n\n\n### Boroughs and neighborhoods[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Boroughs of Mexico City and Neighborhoods in Mexico City\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nChapultepec, the city's most iconic public park, has history back to the Aztec emperors who used the area as a retreat.

On average Mexico City sinks 20 inches (1 foot and 8 inches) or 50 centimetres (1/2 meters) every year.[81] This sinking is causing problems with runoff and wastewater management, leading to flooding problems, especially during the summer.[79][80][82] The entire lake bed is now paved over and most of the city's remaining forested areas lie in the southern boroughs of Milpa Alta, Tlalpan and Xochimilco.[80]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Mexico City geophysical maps\n |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| Topography\n | Hydrology\n | Climate patterns\n |\n\n\n### Environment[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Water management in Greater Mexico City\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\n\n\nHistorical population| Year | Pop. | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1950 | 3,365,081 | —     |\n| 1960 | 5,479,184 | +62.8% |\n| 1970 | 8,830,947 | +61.2% |\n| 1980 | 13,027,620 | +47.5% |\n| 1990 | 15,642,318 | +20.1% |\n| 2000 | 18,457,027 | +18.0% |\n| 2010 | 20,136,681 | +9.1% |\n| 2019 | 21,671,908 | +7.6% |\n| for Mexico City Agglomeration:[110] |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)The Mexico City Megalopolis as defined prior to 2019. Since then Querétaro state is also included.\nGreater Mexico City, in turn, forms part of an even larger megalopolis officially termed the *Zona megalopolitana de la ZMVM* (Mexico City megalopolis), with a population of 33.4 million, more than one quarter of the country's population according to the 2020 census. The megalopolis as defined by the Environmental Commission of the Megalopolis (*CAMe*) covers Mexico City and the states of Mexico, Hidalgo, Puebla, Tlaxcala, Morelos, and since 2019, Querétaro,[116] thus encompassing the metropolitan areas of Mexico City, Puebla, Querétaro, Toluca, Cuernavaca, Pachuca, and others.[117]\n\n\n\n#### Growth[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGreater Mexico City was the fastest growing metropolitan area in the country until the late 1980s. Since then, government policies have supported decentralization with the aim of reducing pollution in Greater Mexico City. While still growing, the annual rate of growth has decreased and is lower than that of Greater Guadalajara and Greater Monterrey.[114]\n\n\nThe net migration rate of Mexico City proper from 1995 to 2000 was negative,[118] which implies that residents are moving to the suburbs of the metropolitan area, or to other states of Mexico. In addition, some inner suburbs are losing population to outer suburbs, indicating the continuing expansion of Greater Mexico City.\n\n\n\n![](image)\nPanorama of Mexico City from Torre Latinoamericana\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Air pollution over Mexico City. Air quality is poorest during the winter.\nBy the 1990s Mexico City had become infamous as one of the world's most polluted cities; however, the city has since become a model for drastically lowering pollution levels. By 2014 carbon monoxide pollution had dropped drastically, while sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide were at levels about a third of those in 1992. The levels of signature pollutants in Mexico City are similar to those of Los Angeles.[83] Despite the cleanup, the metropolitan area is still the most ozone-polluted part of the country, with ozone levels 2.5 times beyond WHO-defined safe limits.[84]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Human Development Index report of 2005[150] shows that there were three boroughs with a very high Human Development Index, 12 with a high HDI value (9 above .85), and one with a medium HDI value (almost high). Benito Juárez borough had the highest HDI of the country (0.9510) followed by Miguel Hidalgo, which came up fourth nationally with an HDI of (0.9189), and Coyoacán was fifth nationally, with an HDI of (0.9169). Cuajimalpa (15th), Cuauhtémoc (23rd), and Azcapotzalco (25th) also had very high values of 0.8994, 0.8922, and 0.8915, respectively.[150]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Satellite image of Mexico City\nMexico City is located in the Valley of Mexico, sometimes called the Basin of Mexico. This valley is located in the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt in the high plateaus of south-central Mexico.[77][78]\n\n\nIt has a minimum altitude of 2,200 meters (7,200 feet) above sea level and is surrounded by mountains and volcanoes that reach elevations of over 5,000 meters (16,000 feet).[79] This valley has no natural drainage outlet for the waters that flow from the mountainsides, making the city vulnerable to flooding. Drainage was engineered through the use of canals and tunnels starting in the 17th century.[77][79]\n\n\nMexico City primarily rests on what was Lake Texcoco.[77] Seismic activity is frequent there.[80] Lake Texcoco was drained starting from the 17th century. Although none of the lake waters remain, the city rests on the lake bed's heavily saturated clay. This soft base is collapsing due to the over-extraction of groundwater, called *groundwater-related subsidence*.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n18. **^** Parish Flannery, Nathaniel (23 December 2013). \"Mexico City Is Focusing on Tech Sector Development\". *Forbes*.

The lower region of the valley receives less rainfall than the upper regions of the south; the lower boroughs of Iztapalapa, Iztacalco, Venustiano Carranza and the east portion of Gustavo A. Madero are usually drier and warmer than the upper southern boroughs of Tlalpan and Milpa Alta, a mountainous region of pine and oak trees known as the range of Ajusco. The average annual temperature varies from 12 to 16 °C (54 to 61 °F), depending on the altitude of the borough. The temperature is rarely below 3 °C (37 °F) or above 30 °C (86 °F).[97] At the Tacubaya observatory, the lowest temperature ever registered was −4.4 °C (24 °F) on 13 February 1960, and the highest temperature on record was 33.9 °C (93 °F) on 9 May 1998.[98] Overall precipitation is heavily concentrated in the summer months, and includes dense hail.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1969 the Mexico City Metro was inaugurated.[46] Explosive growth in the population of the city started in the 1960s, with the population overflowing the boundaries of the Federal District into the neighboring State of Mexico, especially to the north, northwest, and northeast. Between 1960 and 1980 the city's population more than doubled to nearly 9 million.[53]\n\n\nIn 1980 half of all the industrial jobs in Mexico were located in Mexico City. Under relentless growth, the Mexico City government could barely keep up with services. Villagers from the countryside who continued to pour into the city to escape poverty only compounded the city's problems. With no housing available, they took over lands surrounding the city, creating huge shantytowns that extended for many miles.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n32. **^** Alberto Dallal. \"La Ciudad de México: el espectáculo más grande del mundo\". *Electronic magazine Imágenes of the Institute of Aesthetic Research of the National Autonomous University of Mexico*.

When the Federal District was created in 1824, the urban area of Mexico City extended approximately to the area of today's Cuauhtémoc borough. At the beginning of the 20th century, the *elites* began migrating to the south and west and soon the small towns of Mixcoac and San Ángel were incorporated by the growing conurbation. According to the 1921 census, 54.78% of the city's population was considered Mestizo (Indigenous mixed with European), 22.79% considered European, and 18.74% considered Indigenous.[111] This was the last Mexican Census which asked people to self-identify with a heritage other than Amerindian. In 1921, Mexico City had less than one million inhabitants.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Mexico City in 1690.

Due to the limited non-urbanized space at the south—most of which is protected through environmental laws—the contribution of Mexico City in agriculture is the smallest of all federal entities in the country.[162] The economic reforms of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari had a tremendous effect on the city, as a number of businesses, including banks and airlines, were privatized. He also signed the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). This led to decentralization[166] and a shift in Mexico City's economic base, from manufacturing to services, as most factories moved away to either the State of Mexico, or more commonly to the northern border. By contrast, corporate office buildings set their base in the city.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* *The Valley, Anguilla (UK)*\n* Washington, D.C., United States\n |\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n![](image) Mexican state capitals\n |\n| --- |\n| * Aguascalientes (Aguascalientes)\n* Mexicali (Baja California)\n* La Paz (Baja California Sur)\n* Campeche (Campeche)\n* Tuxtla Gutiérrez (Chiapas)\n* Chihuahua (Chihuahua)\n* Saltillo (Coahuila)\n* Colima (Colima)\n* Mexico City\n* Durango (Durango)\n* Guanajuato (Guanajuato)\n* Chilpancingo (Guerrero)\n* Pachuca (Hidalgo)\n* Guadalajara (Jalisco)\n* Toluca (State of Mexico)\n* Morelia (Michoacán)\n* Cuernavaca (Morelos)\n* Tepic (Nayarit)\n* Monterrey (Nuevo León)\n* Oaxaca (Oaxaca)\n* Puebla (Puebla)\n* Querétaro (Querétaro)\n* Chetumal (Quintana Roo)\n* San Luis Potosí (San Luis Potosí)\n* Culiacán (Sinaloa)\n* Hermosillo (Sonora)\n* Villahermosa (Tabasco)\n* Ciudad Victoria (Tamaulipas)\n* Tlaxcala (Tlaxcala)\n* Xalapa (Veracruz)\n* Mérida (Yucatán)\n* Zacatecas (Zacatecas)\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOther sports facilities in Mexico City are the Palacio de los Deportes indoor arena, Francisco Márquez Olympic Swimming Pool, the Hipódromo de Las Américas, the Agustin Melgar Olympic Velodrome, and venues for equestrianism and horse racing, ice hockey, rugby, American-style football, baseball, and basketball.

But it was English politician Charles Latrobe who really penned the following: \"... look at their works: the moles, aqueducts, churches, roads—and the luxurious *City of Palaces* which has risen from the clay-builts ruins of Tenochtitlan...\", on page 84 of the Letter V of *The Rambler in Mexico*.[31]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSnow falls in the city very rarely, although somewhat more often in nearby mountain tops. Throughout its history, the Central Valley of Mexico was accustomed to having several snowfalls per decade (including a period between 1878 and 1895 in which every single year—except 1880—recorded snowfalls[99]) mostly lake-effect snow. The effects of the draining of Lake Texcoco and global warming have greatly reduced snowfalls after the snow flurries of 12 February 1907.[100] Since 1908, snow has only fallen three times, snow on 14 February 1920;[101] snow flurries on 14 March 1940;[102] and on 12 January 1967, when 8 centimeters (3 in) of snow fell on the city, the most on record.[103] The 1967 snowstorm coincided with the operation of *Deep Drainage System* that resulted in the total draining of what was left of Lake Texcoco.[99][104] After the disappearance of Lake Texcoco, snow has never fallen again over Mexico City.[99] The region of the Valley of Mexico receives anti-cyclonic systems. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n## External links[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image) Media related to Mexico City at Wikimedia Commons\n* ![](image) Geographic data related to Mexico City at OpenStreetMap\n* Mexico City Government (in Spanish)\n* Mexico City Tourism Ministry Archived 30 July 2013 at the Wayback Machine (in Spanish)\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nMexico City\n |\n| --- |\n| Topics | * Administrative divisions\n\t+ Boroughs\n\t+ Neighborhoods\n\t+ Barrios Mágicos\n* Airport\n* Architecture\n\t+ Archaeological sites\n\t+ Colonial government and civil buildings\n\t+ Colonial churches\n\t+ Skyscrapers\n* Downtown\n* Folk art\n* Gentrification\n* Government\n\t+ Constituent Assembly\n\t+ Federal District buildings\n\t+ Heads of government\n\t+ Law enforcement\n\t+ Legislative Assembly\n* History\n\t+ Timeline\n* Metropolitan area\n* Parking\n* Pollution\n* Street vendors\n* Transport\n* Water management\n | ![Coat of arms of Mexico City](image)\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nWorld Heritage Sites in Mexico\n |\n| --- |\n| North West | * Archaeological Zone of Paquimé, Casas Grandes\n* El Pinacate y Gran Desierto de Altar Biosphere Reserve\n* Islands and Protected Areas of the Gulf of California1\n* Rock Paintings of Sierra de San Francisco\n* Whale Sanctuary of El Vizcaino\n |\n| North Central | * Camino Real de Tierra Adentro\n* Franciscan Missions in the Sierra Gorda of Querétaro\n* Historic Centre of Zacatecas\n* Historic Monuments Zone of Querétaro\n* Historic Town of Guanajuato and Adjacent Mines\n* Protected town of San Miguel de Allende and the Sanctuary of Jesús Nazareno de Atotonilco\n |\n| West | * Agave Landscape and Ancient Industrial Facilities of Tequila\n* Revillagigedo Archipelago\n* Historic Centre of Morelia\n* Hospicio Cabañas, Guadalajara\n* Islands and Protected Areas of the Gulf of California1\n* Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve1\n |\n| East | * Earliest 16th-century monasteries on the slopes of Popocatépetl1\n* Pre-Hispanic City of El Tajín\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Zócalo/Tenochtitlan metro station\n |\n| Other | * Barrio Chino\n* Chapultepec aqueduct\n* Edificio Miguel E.

The central area's last streetcar line (tramway, or *tranvía*) closed in 1979.\n\n\n\n### Bus[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Mexico City Metrobús and Red de Transporte de Pasajeros\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBetween 2000 and 2004 an average of 478 crimes were reported each day in Mexico City; however, the actual crime rate is thought to be much higher \"since most people are reluctant to report crime\".[151] Under policies enacted by Mayor Marcelo Ebrard between 2009 and 2011, Mexico City underwent a major security upgrade with violent and petty crime rates both falling significantly despite the rise in violent crime in other parts of the country. Some of the policies enacted included the installation of 11,000 security cameras around the city and a very large expansion of the police force. Mexico City has one of the world's highest police officer-to-resident ratios, with one uniformed officer per 100 citizens.[152] Since 1997 the prison population has increased by more than 500%.[153] Political scientist Markus-Michael Müller argues that mostly informal street vendors are hit by these measures. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe city grew as the population did, coming up against the lake's waters. As the depth of the lake water fluctuated, Mexico City was subject to periodic flooding. A major labor draft, the *desagüe*, compelled thousands of indigenous over the colonial period to work on infrastructure to prevent flooding. Floods were not only an inconvenience but also a health hazard, since during flood periods human waste polluted the city's streets. By draining the area, the mosquito population dropped as did the frequency of the diseases they spread. However, draining the wetlands also changed the habitat for fish and birds and the areas accessible for indigenous cultivation close to the capital.[58] The 16th century saw a proliferation of churches, many of which can still be seen today in the historic center.[53]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe most recognizable icon of Mexico City is the golden Angel of Independence on the wide, elegant avenue Paseo de la Reforma, modeled by the order of the Emperor Maximilian of Mexico after the Champs-Élysées in Paris. This avenue was designed over the Americas' oldest known major roadway in the 19th century to connect the National Palace (seat of government) with the Castle of Chapultepec, the imperial residence. Today, this avenue is an important financial district in which the Mexican Stock Exchange and several corporate headquarters are located. Another important avenue is the Avenida de los Insurgentes, which extends 28.8 km (17.9 mi) and is one of the longest single avenues in the world.\n\n\nChapultepec Park houses the Chapultepec Castle, now a museum on a hill that overlooks the park and its numerous museums, monuments and the national zoo and the National Museum of Anthropology (which houses the Aztec Calendar Stone). \n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nArchitects Teodoro González de León and Alberto Kalach along with a group of Mexican urbanists, engineers and biologists have developed the project plan for *Recovering the City of Lakes*. If approved by the government the project will contribute to the supply of water from natural sources to the Valley of Mexico, the creation of new natural spaces, a great improvement in air quality, and greater population establishment planning.\n\n\n\n### Pollution[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Air pollution in Mexico City\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nSummer Olympic Games host cities\n |\n| --- |\n| * **1896:** ![Greece](image) Athens\n* **1900:** ![France](image) Paris\n* **1904:** ![United States](image) St. Louis\n* **1908:** ![United Kingdom](image) London\n* **1912:** ![Sweden](image) Stockholm\n* **1916:** *None*[c1]\n* **1920:** ![Belgium](image) Antwerp\n* **1924:** ![France](image) Paris\n* **1928:** ![Netherlands](image) Amsterdam\n* **1932:** ![United States](image) Los Angeles\n* **1936:** ![Germany](image) Berlin\n* **1940:** *None*[c2]\n* **1944:** *None*[c2]\n* **1948:** ![United Kingdom](image) London\n* **1952:** ![Finland](image) Helsinki\n* **1956:** ![Australia](image) Melbourne\n* **1960:** ![Italy](image) Rome\n* **1964:** ![Japan](image) Tokyo\n* **1968:** ![Mexico](image) Mexico City\n* **1972:** ![West Germany](image) Munich\n* **1976:** ![Canada](image) Montreal\n* **1980:** ![Soviet Union](image) Moscow\n* **1984:** ![United States](image) Los Angeles\n* **1988:** ![South Korea](image) Seoul\n* **1992:** ![Spain](image) Barcelona\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHe sees punishment \"related to the growing politicization of security and crime issues and the resulting criminalization of the people living at the margins of urban society, in particular those who work in the city's informal economy\".[153]\n\n\nIn 2016, the incidence of femicides was 3.2 per 100 000 inhabitants, the national average being 4.2.[154] A 2015 city government report found that two of three women over the age of 15 in the capital suffered some form of violence.[155] In addition to street harassment, one of the places where women in Mexico City are subjected to violence is on and around public transport. Annually the Metro of Mexico City receives 300 complaints of sexual harassment.[156] While the violence against women in Mexico City is rising, there is still a large number of incidents of kidnappings and killings that go undetected and unreported due to the corruption in the police department.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### International relations[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Mexico City International Airport\nMexico City International Airport is Mexico City's primary airport (IATA Airport Code: MEX), and serves as the hub of Aeroméxico (Skyteam).
