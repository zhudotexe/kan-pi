The group's objective—to overthrow Castro via espionage, sabotage, and other covert tactics—was never pursued.[203] In November 1961, he authorized Operation Mongoose (also known as the Cuban Project).[204] In March 1962, Kennedy rejected Operation Northwoods, proposals for false flag attacks against American military and civilian targets,[205] and blaming them on the Cuban government in order to gain approval for a war against Cuba. However, the administration continued to plan for an invasion of Cuba in the summer of 1962.[204]\n\n\n\n#### Cuban Missile Crisis[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cuban Missile Crisis\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Kennedy confers with Attorney General Robert Kennedy, c. October 1962\nThe U.S. Navy would stop and inspect all Soviet ships arriving off Cuba, beginning October 24. Several Soviet ships approached the blockade line, but they stopped or reversed course to avoid the blockade.[215] The Organization of American States gave unanimous support to the removal of the missiles. Kennedy exchanged two sets of letters with Khrushchev, to no avail.[216] United Nations (UN) Secretary General U Thant requested both parties to reverse their decisions and enter a cooling-off period. Khrushchev agreed, but Kennedy did not.[217] Kennedy managed to preserve restraint when a Soviet missile unauthorizedly downed a U.S. Lockheed U-2 reconnaissance aircraft over Cuba, killing the pilot Rudolf Anderson.[218]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n362. **^** Selverstone, Marc. \"JFK and the Space Race\".

It also could not be assured that the assault would be 100% effective.[213] In concurrence with a majority-vote of the NSC, Kennedy decided on a naval blockade (or \"quarantine\"). On October 22, after privately informing the cabinet and leading members of Congress about the situation, Kennedy announced on national television the naval blockade and warned that U.S. forces would seize \"offensive weapons and associated materiel\" that Soviet vessels might attempt to deliver to Cuba.[214]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nKennedy faced a dilemma: if the U.S. attacked the sites, it might lead to nuclear war with the Soviet Union, but if the U.S. did nothing, it would be faced with the increased threat from close-range nuclear weapons (positioned approximately 90 mi (140 km) away from the Florida coast). The U.S. would also appear to the world as less committed to the defense of the Western Hemisphere. On a personal level, Kennedy needed to show resolve in reaction to Khrushchev, especially after the Vienna summit.[210] To deal with the crisis, he formed an ad hoc body of key advisers, later known as EXCOMM, that met secretly between October 16 and 28.[211]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAt the president's direction, Robert Kennedy privately informed Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin that the U.S. would remove the Jupiter missiles from Turkey \"within a short time after this crisis was over.\"[219] On October 28, Khrushchev agreed to dismantle the missile sites, subject to UN inspections.[220] The U.S. publicly promised never to invade Cuba and privately agreed to remove its Jupiter missiles from Italy and Turkey, which were by then obsolete and had been supplanted by submarines equipped with UGM-27 Polaris missiles.[221]\n\n\nThis crisis brought the world closer to nuclear war than at any point before or after. It is considered that \"the humanity\" of both Khrushchev and Kennedy prevailed.[222] The crisis improved the image of American willpower and the president's credibility. Kennedy's approval rating increased from 66% to 77% immediately thereafter.[223]\n\n\n\n#### Latin America and communism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Foreign policy of the John F. Kennedy administration § Latin America\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nKennedy's administration included high tensions with communist states in the Cold War. As a result, he increased the number of American military advisers in South Vietnam. The Strategic Hamlet Program began in Vietnam during his presidency. In April 1961, he authorized an attempt to overthrow the Cuban government of Fidel Castro in the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion. In November 1961, he authorized Operation Mongoose, also aimed at removing the communists from power in Cuba. He rejected Operation Northwoods in March 1962, but his administration continued to plan for an invasion of Cuba in the summer of 1962. The following October, U.S. spy planes discovered Soviet missile bases had been deployed in Cuba. The resulting period of tensions, termed the Cuban Missile Crisis, nearly resulted in the breakout of a global thermonuclear conflict. He also signed the first nuclear weapons treaty in October 1963. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n33. **^** Dallek 2003, pp. 61–66.\n34. **^** Logevall, Fredrik (2020). *JFK - Volume One*.

The photos were shown to Kennedy on October 16; a consensus was reached that the missiles were offensive in nature and thus posed an immediate nuclear threat.[209]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)President Kennedy and Jacqueline Kennedy greet members of the 2506 Cuban Invasion Brigade at Miami's Orange Bowl. c. December 29, 1962\nThe Eisenhower administration had created a plan to overthrow Fidel Castro's regime though an invasion of Cuba by a counter-revolutionary insurgency composed of U.S.-trained, anti-Castro Cuban exiles[188][189] led by CIA paramilitary officers.[190] Kennedy had campaigned on a hardline stance against Castro, and when presented with the plan that had been developed under the Eisenhower administration, he enthusiastically adopted it regardless of the risk of inflaming tensions with the Soviet Union.[191] Kennedy approved the final invasion plan on April 4, 1961.[192]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\npresidents after the Kennedy administration were less supportive of the program and by 1973, the permanent committee established to implement the Alliance was disbanded by the Organization of American States.[231]\n\n\nThe Eisenhower administration, through the CIA, had begun formulating plans to assassinate Castro in Cuba and Rafael Trujillo in the Dominican Republic. When Kennedy took office, he privately instructed the CIA that any plan must include plausible deniability by the U.S. His public position was in opposition.[232] In June 1961, the Dominican Republic's leader was assassinated; in the days following, Undersecretary of State Chester Bowles led a cautious reaction by the nation. Robert Kennedy, who saw an opportunity for the U.S., called Bowles \"a gutless bastard\" to his face.[233]\n\n\n\n#### Laos[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Laotian Civil War\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n156. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Kennedy, John F.

Johnson, assumed the presidency upon Kennedy's death. Lee Harvey Oswald, a former U.S. Marine, was arrested for the assassination, but he was shot and killed by Jack Ruby two days later. The FBI and the Warren Commission both concluded Oswald had acted alone, but conspiracy theories about the assassination still persist. After Kennedy's death, Congress enacted many of his proposals, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Revenue Act of 1964. Kennedy ranks highly in polls of U.S. presidents with historians and the general public. His personal life has also been the focus of considerable sustained interest following public revelations in the 1970s of his chronic health ailments and extramarital affairs.

He was the youngest person to assume the presidency by election and the youngest president at the end of his tenure.[2] Kennedy served at the height of the Cold War, and the majority of his foreign policy concerned relations with the Soviet Union and Cuba. A Democrat from Massachusetts, Kennedy served in both houses of the U.S. Congress prior to his presidency.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* U.S. Scientists: George Beadle / Charles Draper / John Enders / Donald A.

Lee Harvey Oswald, an order filler at the Texas School Book Depository from which the shots were fired, was arrested for the murder of police officer J. D. Tippit and was subsequently charged with Kennedy's assassination. He denied shooting anyone, claiming he was a patsy,[367][368] and was shot dead by Jack Ruby on November 24, before he could be prosecuted. Ruby was arrested and convicted for the murder of Oswald. Ruby successfully appealed his conviction and death sentence but became ill and died of cancer on January 3, 1967, while the date for his new trial was being set.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA month later, both the Soviet Union and East Berlin began blocking any further passage of East Germans into West Berlin and erected barbed wire fences, which were quickly upgraded to the Berlin Wall. Kennedy acquiesced to the wall, though he sent Vice President Johnson to West Berlin to reaffirm U.S. commitment to the enclave's defense. In the following months, in a sign of rising Cold War tensions, both the U.S. and the Soviet Union ended a moratorium on nuclear weapon testing.[186] A brief stand-off between U.S. and Soviet tanks occurred at Checkpoint Charlie in October following a dispute over free movement of Allied personnel. The crisis was defused largely through a backchannel communication the Kennedy administration had set up with Soviet spy Georgi Bolshakov.[187]\n\n\n\n#### Bay of Pigs Invasion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bay of Pigs Invasion\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nKennedy's foreign policy was dominated by American confrontations with the Soviet Union, manifested by proxy contests in the global state of tension known as the Cold War. Like his predecessors, Kennedy adopted the policy of containment, which sought to stop the spread of communism.[164] Fearful of the possibility of a global nuclear war, Kennedy implemented a defense strategy known as flexible response. This strategy relied on multiple options for responding to the Soviet Union, discouraged massive retaliation, and encouraged mutual deterrence.[165][166] In contrast to Eisenhower's warning about the perils of the military-industrial complex, Kennedy focused on rearmament. From 1961 to 1964 the number of nuclear weapons increased by 50 percent, as did the number of B-52 bombers to deliver them.[167]\n\n\n\n#### Decolonization and the Congo Crisis[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| US Capitol rotunda | * Clay (1852)\n* **Lincoln** (1865, funeral)\n* Stevens (1868)\n* Sumner (1874)\n* Wilson (1875)\n* **Garfield** (1881)\n* Logan (1886)\n* **McKinley** (1901)\n* L'Enfant (1909)\n* Dewey (1917)\n* Unknown Soldier for World War I (1921)\n* **Harding** (1923)\n* **W.

Khrushchev, for his part, was impressed with the president's intelligence but thought him as weak. Kennedy did succeed in conveying the bottom line to Khrushchev on the most sensitive issue before them, a proposed treaty between Moscow and East Berlin. He made it clear that any treaty interfering with U.S. access rights in West Berlin would be regarded as an act of war.[182] Shortly after Kennedy returned home, the Soviet Union announced its plan to sign a treaty with East Berlin, abrogating any third-party occupation rights in either sector of the city. Depressed and angry, Kennedy assumed that his only option was to prepare the country for nuclear war, which he personally thought had a one-in-five chance of occurring.[183]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn April 15, 1961, eight CIA-supplied B-26 bombers left Nicaragua to bomb Cuban airfields. The bombers missed many of their targets and left most of Castro's air force intact.[193] On April 17, the 1,500 U.S.-trained Cuban exile invasion force, known as Brigade 2506, landed on the beach at Playa Girón in the Bay of Pigs and immediately came under heavy fire.[194] The goal was to spark a widespread popular uprising against Castro, but no such uprising occurred.[195] No U.S. air support was provided. The invading force was defeated within three days by the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces; 114 were killed and over 1,100 were taken prisoner.[196] Kennedy was forced to negotiate for the release of the 1,189 survivors. After twenty months, Cuba released the captured exiles in exchange for a ransom of $53 million worth of food and medicine.[197] The incident made Castro feel wary of the U.S. and led him to believe that another invasion would take place.[198]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n122. **^** *The Kennedys* Archived February 27, 2010, at the Wayback Machine. *American Experience*.

The commission concluded that Oswald acted alone in killing Kennedy and that Oswald was not part of any conspiracy.[369] The results of this investigation are disputed by many.[370] The assassination proved to be a pivotal moment in U.S. history because of its impact on the nation, and the ensuing political repercussions. A 2004 Fox News poll found that 66% of Americans thought there had been a conspiracy to kill President Kennedy, while 74% thought that there had been a cover-up.[371] A Gallup Poll in November 2013 showed 61% believed in a conspiracy, and only 30% thought that Oswald did it alone.[372] In 1979, the U.S. House Select Committee on Assassinations concluded, with one third of the committee dissenting, that it believed \"that Kennedy was probably assassinated as a result of a conspiracy. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nJohn F.

Joe's death during the war in 1944 changed that course and the assignment fell to JFK as the second eldest of the Kennedy siblings.[73] In the summer of 1945, Joe Kennedy Sr. made a special effort to renew the family's presence in Massachusetts (i.e., a ship-launching ceremony for the USS *Joseph P. Kennedy Jr.* to remind voters that two of his sons were war heroes). Boston mayor Maurice J.

Kennedy's father intervened by providing misleading medical records and convincing PT officers that his presence would bring publicity to the fleet.[44] Kennedy completed six months of training at the Naval Reserve Officer Training School in Chicago and at the Motor Torpedo Boat Squadrons Training Center in Melville, Rhode Island.[41][45] His first command was *PT-101* from December 7, 1942, until February 23, 1943.[42] Unhappy to be assigned to the Panama Canal, far from the fighting, Kennedy appealed to U.S. Senator David Walsh of Massachusetts, who arranged for him to be assigned to the South Pacific.[44]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Dudley, Robert L.; Shiraev, Eric (2008). *Counting Every Vote: The Most Contentious Elections in American History*.

On Election Day, Kennedy defeated Nixon in one of the closest presidential elections of the 20th century. In the national popular vote, by most accounts, Kennedy led Nixon by just two-tenths of one percent (49.7% to 49.5%), while in the Electoral College, he won 303 votes to Nixon's 219 (269 were needed to win).[154] Fourteen electors from Mississippi and Alabama refused to support Kennedy because of his support for the civil rights movement; they voted for Senator Harry F. Byrd of Virginia, as did an elector from Oklahoma.[154] Forty-three years old, Kennedy was the youngest person ever elected to the presidency (though Theodore Roosevelt was a year younger when, as vice-president, he succeeded to the presidency after the assassination of William McKinley in 1901).[155]\n\n\n\n## Presidency (1961–1963)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Presidency of John F.

Averell Harriman to Moscow to negotiate a treaty with the Soviets.[281] The introductory sessions included Khrushchev, who later delegated Soviet representation to Andrei Gromyko. It quickly became clear that a comprehensive test ban would not be implemented, due largely to the reluctance of the Soviets to allow inspections that would verify compliance.[282]\n\n\nUltimately, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union were the initial signatories to a limited treaty, which prohibited atomic testing on the ground, in the atmosphere, or underwater, but not underground. The U.S. Senate approved the treaty on September 23, 1963, by an 80–19 margin. Kennedy signed the ratified treaty on October 7, 1963.[283] France was quick to declare that it was free to continue developing and testing its nuclear defenses.[284]\n\n\n\n### Domestic policy[edit]\n\n\n#### New Frontier[edit]\n\n\nMain article: New Frontier\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nKennedy brought to the White House a contrast in organization compared to the decision-making structure of former President Eisenhower, and he wasted no time in scrapping Eisenhower's methods.[158] Kennedy preferred the organizational structure of a wheel with all the spokes leading to the president. He was ready and willing to make the increased number of quick decisions required in such an environment. He selected a mixture of experienced and inexperienced people to serve in his cabinet. \"We can learn our jobs together,\" he stated.[159]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Foreign policy | * Alliance for Progress\n* Arms Control and Disarmament Agency\n\t+ Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty\n* Flexible response\n* Kennedy Doctrine\n* Peace Corps\n* Trade Expansion Act\n* Migration and Refugee Assistance Act\n* USAID\n* Vietnam War\n* Cuba: Bay of Pigs Invasion\n* Cuban Project\n* Cuban Missile Crisis\n\t+ ExComm\n* Soviet Union: Berlin Crisis\n* Moscow–Washington hotline\n* Vienna summit\n |\n| New Frontier | * Clean Air Act\n* Communications Satellite Act\n* Community Mental Health Act\n* Equal Pay Act\n* Executive Order 11110\n* Federal affirmative action\n* Federal housing segregation ban\n* Fifty-mile hikes\n* Food for Peace\n* Pilot Food Stamp Program\n* Presidential Medal of Freedom\n* Space policy\n* Status of Women (Presidential Commission)\n* University of Alabama integration\n* Voter Education Project\n* All-Channel Receiver Act\n* Oil Pollution Act of 1961\n* Revenue Act of 1962\n* Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act of 1961\n* Wetlands Loan Act\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOf the 24 torpedoes fired that night by eight of the American PTs, not one hit the Japanese convoy.[47] On that dark and moonless night, Kennedy spotted a Japanese destroyer heading north on its return from the base of Kolombangara around 2:00 a.m., and attempted to turn to attack, when *PT-109* was rammed suddenly at an angle and cut in half by the destroyer *Amagiri*, killing two *PT-109* crew members while the others tried to stay afloat amid the wreckage.[48][49][42][a] Avoiding surrender, the remaining crew swam towards Plum Pudding Island, 3.5 miles (5.6 km) southwest of the remains of *PT-109*, on August 2.[42][51] Despite re-injuring his back in the collision, Kennedy towed a badly burned crewman through the water to the island with a life jacket strap clenched between his teeth.[52] From there, Kennedy and his subordinate, Ensign George Ross, made various forays through the coral islands, searching for help.[53] When they encountered an English-speaking native with a canoe, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNavy,[430] and one of the enduring legacies of his administration was the creation in 1961 of another special forces command, the Navy SEALs,[431] which Kennedy enthusiastically supported.[432]\n\n\nKennedy's civil rights proposals led to the Civil Rights Act of 1964.[433] President Lyndon B.

The group's objective—to overthrow Castro via espionage, sabotage, and other covert tactics—was never pursued.[203] In November 1961, he authorized Operation Mongoose (also known as the Cuban Project).[204] In March 1962, Kennedy rejected Operation Northwoods, proposals for false flag attacks against American military and civilian targets,[205] and blaming them on the Cuban government in order to gain approval for a war against Cuba.

Kennedy exchanged two sets of letters with Khrushchev, to no avail.[216] United Nations (UN) Secretary General U Thant requested both parties to reverse their decisions and enter a cooling-off period. Khrushchev agreed, but Kennedy did not.[217] Kennedy managed to preserve restraint when a Soviet missile unauthorizedly downed a U.S. Lockheed U-2 reconnaissance aircraft over Cuba, killing the pilot Rudolf Anderson.[218]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n362. **^** Selverstone, Marc. \"JFK and the Space Race\".

It also could not be assured that the assault would be 100% effective.[213] In concurrence with a majority-vote of the NSC, Kennedy decided on a naval blockade (or \"quarantine\"). On October 22, after privately informing the cabinet and leading members of Congress about the situation, Kennedy announced on national television the naval blockade and warned that U.S. forces would seize \"offensive weapons and associated materiel\" that Soviet vessels might attempt to deliver to Cuba.[214]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nKennedy faced a dilemma: if the U.S. attacked the sites, it might lead to nuclear war with the Soviet Union, but if the U.S. did nothing, it would be faced with the increased threat from close-range nuclear weapons (positioned approximately 90 mi (140 km) away from the Florida coast). The U.S. would also appear to the world as less committed to the defense of the Western Hemisphere. On a personal level, Kennedy needed to show resolve in reaction to Khrushchev, especially after the Vienna summit.[210] To deal with the crisis, he formed an ad hoc body of key advisers, later known as EXCOMM, that met secretly between October 16 and 28.[211]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAt the president's direction, Robert Kennedy privately informed Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin that the U.S. would remove the Jupiter missiles from Turkey \"within a short time after this crisis was over.\"[219] On October 28, Khrushchev agreed to dismantle the missile sites, subject to UN inspections.[220] The U.S. publicly promised never to invade Cuba and privately agreed to remove its Jupiter missiles from Italy and Turkey, which were by then obsolete and had been supplanted by submarines equipped with UGM-27 Polaris missiles.[221]\n\n\nThis crisis brought the world closer to nuclear war than at any point before or after. It is considered that \"the humanity\" of both Khrushchev and Kennedy prevailed.[222] The crisis improved the image of American willpower and the president's credibility. Kennedy's approval rating increased from 66% to 77% immediately thereafter.[223]\n\n\n\n#### Latin America and communism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Foreign policy of the John F. Kennedy administration § Latin America\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nKennedy's administration included high tensions with communist states in the Cold War. As a result, he increased the number of American military advisers in South Vietnam. The Strategic Hamlet Program began in Vietnam during his presidency. In April 1961, he authorized an attempt to overthrow the Cuban government of Fidel Castro in the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion. In November 1961, he authorized Operation Mongoose, also aimed at removing the communists from power in Cuba. He rejected Operation Northwoods in March 1962, but his administration continued to plan for an invasion of Cuba in the summer of 1962. The following October, U.S. spy planes discovered Soviet missile bases had been deployed in Cuba. The resulting period of tensions, termed the Cuban Missile Crisis, nearly resulted in the breakout of a global thermonuclear conflict. He also signed the first nuclear weapons treaty in October 1963. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n33. **^** Dallek 2003, pp. 61–66.\n34. **^** Logevall, Fredrik (2020). *JFK - Volume One*.

The photos were shown to Kennedy on October 16; a consensus was reached that the missiles were offensive in nature and thus posed an immediate nuclear threat.[209]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)President Kennedy and Jacqueline Kennedy greet members of the 2506 Cuban Invasion Brigade at Miami's Orange Bowl. c. December 29, 1962\nThe Eisenhower administration had created a plan to overthrow Fidel Castro's regime though an invasion of Cuba by a counter-revolutionary insurgency composed of U.S.-trained, anti-Castro Cuban exiles[188][189] led by CIA paramilitary officers.[190] Kennedy had campaigned on a hardline stance against Castro, and when presented with the plan that had been developed under the Eisenhower administration, he enthusiastically adopted it regardless of the risk of inflaming tensions with the Soviet Union.[191] Kennedy approved the final invasion plan on April 4, 1961.[192]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\npresidents after the Kennedy administration were less supportive of the program and by 1973, the permanent committee established to implement the Alliance was disbanded by the Organization of American States.[231]\n\n\nThe Eisenhower administration, through the CIA, had begun formulating plans to assassinate Castro in Cuba and Rafael Trujillo in the Dominican Republic. When Kennedy took office, he privately instructed the CIA that any plan must include plausible deniability by the U.S. His public position was in opposition.[232] In June 1961, the Dominican Republic's leader was assassinated; in the days following, Undersecretary of State Chester Bowles led a cautious reaction by the nation.

When it proved unsuccessful, he was convinced that the plan was a setup to make him look bad.[199] He took responsibility for the failure, saying, \"We got a big kick in the leg and we deserved it. But maybe we'll learn something from it.\"[200] He appointed Robert Kennedy to help lead a committee to examine the causes of the failure.[201] The Kennedy administration banned all Cuban imports and convinced the Organization of American States to expel Cuba.[202]\n\n\n\n#### Operation Mongoose[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Cabinet\n |\n| --- |\n| Vice President | * Lyndon B.

Johnson, assumed the presidency upon Kennedy's death. Lee Harvey Oswald, a former U.S. Marine, was arrested for the assassination, but he was shot and killed by Jack Ruby two days later. The FBI and the Warren Commission both concluded Oswald had acted alone, but conspiracy theories about the assassination still persist. After Kennedy's death, Congress enacted many of his proposals, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Revenue Act of 1964. Kennedy ranks highly in polls of U.S. presidents with historians and the general public. His personal life has also been the focus of considerable sustained interest following public revelations in the 1970s of his chronic health ailments and extramarital affairs. Kennedy is the most recent U.S. president to have died in office.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| John F.

Lee Harvey Oswald, an order filler at the Texas School Book Depository from which the shots were fired, was arrested for the murder of police officer J. D. Tippit and was subsequently charged with Kennedy's assassination. He denied shooting anyone, claiming he was a patsy,[367][368] and was shot dead by Jack Ruby on November 24, before he could be prosecuted. Ruby was arrested and convicted for the murder of Oswald. Ruby successfully appealed his conviction and death sentence but became ill and died of cancer on January 3, 1967, while the date for his new trial was being set.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA month later, both the Soviet Union and East Berlin began blocking any further passage of East Germans into West Berlin and erected barbed wire fences, which were quickly upgraded to the Berlin Wall. Kennedy acquiesced to the wall, though he sent Vice President Johnson to West Berlin to reaffirm U.S. commitment to the enclave's defense. In the following months, in a sign of rising Cold War tensions, both the U.S. and the Soviet Union ended a moratorium on nuclear weapon testing.[186] A brief stand-off between U.S. and Soviet tanks occurred at Checkpoint Charlie in October following a dispute over free movement of Allied personnel. The crisis was defused largely through a backchannel communication the Kennedy administration had set up with Soviet spy Georgi Bolshakov.[187]\n\n\n\n#### Bay of Pigs Invasion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bay of Pigs Invasion\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nKennedy's foreign policy was dominated by American confrontations with the Soviet Union, manifested by proxy contests in the global state of tension known as the Cold War. Like his predecessors, Kennedy adopted the policy of containment, which sought to stop the spread of communism.[164] Fearful of the possibility of a global nuclear war, Kennedy implemented a defense strategy known as flexible response. This strategy relied on multiple options for responding to the Soviet Union, discouraged massive retaliation, and encouraged mutual deterrence.[165][166] In contrast to Eisenhower's warning about the perils of the military-industrial complex, Kennedy focused on rearmament. From 1961 to 1964 the number of nuclear weapons increased by 50 percent, as did the number of B-52 bombers to deliver them.[167]\n\n\n\n#### Decolonization and the Congo Crisis[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| US Capitol rotunda | * Clay (1852)\n* **Lincoln** (1865, funeral)\n* Stevens (1868)\n* Sumner (1874)\n* Wilson (1875)\n* **Garfield** (1881)\n* Logan (1886)\n* **McKinley** (1901)\n* L'Enfant (1909)\n* Dewey (1917)\n* Unknown Soldier for World War I (1921)\n* **Harding** (1923)\n* **W.

Kennedy\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of the John F. Kennedy assassination.\n\nPresident Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas at 12:30 p.m. Central Standard Time (CST) on Friday, November 22, 1963. He was in Texas on a political trip to smooth over frictions in the Democratic Party between liberals Ralph Yarborough and Don Yarborough (no relation) and conservative John Connally.[364] Traveling in a presidential motorcade through downtown Dallas, he was shot once in the back, the bullet exiting via his throat, and once in the head.[365]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Offices and distinctions\n |\n| --- |\n| | U.S. House of Representatives |\n| --- |\n| Preceded byJames Michael Curley\n |  **Member of the U.S. House of Representativesfrom Massachusetts's 11th congressional district** 1947–1953\n | Succeeded byTip O'Neill\n |\n| Party political offices\n |\n| Preceded byDavid I.

Khrushchev, for his part, was impressed with the president's intelligence but thought him as weak. Kennedy did succeed in conveying the bottom line to Khrushchev on the most sensitive issue before them, a proposed treaty between Moscow and East Berlin. He made it clear that any treaty interfering with U.S. access rights in West Berlin would be regarded as an act of war.[182] Shortly after Kennedy returned home, the Soviet Union announced its plan to sign a treaty with East Berlin, abrogating any third-party occupation rights in either sector of the city. Depressed and angry, Kennedy assumed that his only option was to prepare the country for nuclear war, which he personally thought had a one-in-five chance of occurring.[183]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn April 15, 1961, eight CIA-supplied B-26 bombers left Nicaragua to bomb Cuban airfields. The bombers missed many of their targets and left most of Castro's air force intact.[193] On April 17, the 1,500 U.S.-trained Cuban exile invasion force, known as Brigade 2506, landed on the beach at Playa Girón in the Bay of Pigs and immediately came under heavy fire.[194] The goal was to spark a widespread popular uprising against Castro, but no such uprising occurred.[195] No U.S. air support was provided. The invading force was defeated within three days by the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces; 114 were killed and over 1,100 were taken prisoner.[196] Kennedy was forced to negotiate for the release of the 1,189 survivors. After twenty months, Cuba released the captured exiles in exchange for a ransom of $53 million worth of food and medicine.[197] The incident made Castro feel wary of the U.S. and led him to believe that another invasion would take place.[198]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n122. **^** *The Kennedys* Archived February 27, 2010, at the Wayback Machine. *American Experience*.

The story was chronicled by writer John Hersey in *The New Yorker* in 1944 (decades later it was the basis of a successful film).[55] It followed Kennedy into politics and provided a strong foundation for his appeal as a leader.[56] Hersey portrayed Kennedy as a modest, self-deprecating hero.[57] For his courage and leadership, Kennedy was awarded the Navy and Marine Corps Medal, and the injuries he suffered during the incident also qualified him for a Purple Heart.[56]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n241. **^** \"Vietnam War\".

The commission concluded that Oswald acted alone in killing Kennedy and that Oswald was not part of any conspiracy.[369] The results of this investigation are disputed by many.[370] The assassination proved to be a pivotal moment in U.S. history because of its impact on the nation, and the ensuing political repercussions. A 2004 Fox News poll found that 66% of Americans thought there had been a conspiracy to kill President Kennedy, while 74% thought that there had been a cover-up.[371] A Gallup Poll in November 2013 showed 61% believed in a conspiracy, and only 30% thought that Oswald did it alone.[372] In 1979, the U.S. House Select Committee on Assassinations concluded, with one third of the committee dissenting, that it believed \"that Kennedy was probably assassinated as a result of a conspiracy. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nJohn F.

At the commemoration of the 25th anniversary of Kennedy's death, General Michael D. Healy, the last commander of Special Forces in Vietnam, spoke at Arlington National Cemetery.

Joe's death during the war in 1944 changed that course and the assignment fell to JFK as the second eldest of the Kennedy siblings.[73] In the summer of 1945, Joe Kennedy Sr. made a special effort to renew the family's presence in Massachusetts (i.e., a ship-launching ceremony for the USS *Joseph P. Kennedy Jr.* to remind voters that two of his sons were war heroes). Boston mayor Maurice J.

Kennedy's father intervened by providing misleading medical records and convincing PT officers that his presence would bring publicity to the fleet.[44] Kennedy completed six months of training at the Naval Reserve Officer Training School in Chicago and at the Motor Torpedo Boat Squadrons Training Center in Melville, Rhode Island.[41][45] His first command was *PT-101* from December 7, 1942, until February 23, 1943.[42] Unhappy to be assigned to the Panama Canal, far from the fighting, Kennedy appealed to U.S. Senator David Walsh of Massachusetts, who arranged for him to be assigned to the South Pacific.[44]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Dudley, Robert L.; Shiraev, Eric (2008). *Counting Every Vote: The Most Contentious Elections in American History*.

On Election Day, Kennedy defeated Nixon in one of the closest presidential elections of the 20th century. In the national popular vote, by most accounts, Kennedy led Nixon by just two-tenths of one percent (49.7% to 49.5%), while in the Electoral College, he won 303 votes to Nixon's 219 (269 were needed to win).[154] Fourteen electors from Mississippi and Alabama refused to support Kennedy because of his support for the civil rights movement; they voted for Senator Harry F. Byrd of Virginia, as did an elector from Oklahoma.[154] Forty-three years old, Kennedy was the youngest person ever elected to the presidency (though Theodore Roosevelt was a year younger when, as vice-president, he succeeded to the presidency after the assassination of William McKinley in 1901).[155]\n\n\n\n## Presidency (1961–1963)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Presidency of John F. Kennedy\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn July 1963, Kennedy sent W. Averell Harriman to Moscow to negotiate a treaty with the Soviets.[281] The introductory sessions included Khrushchev, who later delegated Soviet representation to Andrei Gromyko. It quickly became clear that a comprehensive test ban would not be implemented, due largely to the reluctance of the Soviets to allow inspections that would verify compliance.[282]\n\n\nUltimately, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union were the initial signatories to a limited treaty, which prohibited atomic testing on the ground, in the atmosphere, or underwater, but not underground. The U.S. Senate approved the treaty on September 23, 1963, by an 80–19 margin. Kennedy signed the ratified treaty on October 7, 1963.[283] France was quick to declare that it was free to continue developing and testing its nuclear defenses.[284]\n\n\n\n### Domestic policy[edit]\n\n\n#### New Frontier[edit]\n\n\nMain article: New Frontier\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nKennedy brought to the White House a contrast in organization compared to the decision-making structure of former President Eisenhower, and he wasted no time in scrapping Eisenhower's methods.[158] Kennedy preferred the organizational structure of a wheel with all the spokes leading to the president. He was ready and willing to make the increased number of quick decisions required in such an environment. He selected a mixture of experienced and inexperienced people to serve in his cabinet. \"We can learn our jobs together,\" he stated.[159]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Foreign policy | * Alliance for Progress\n* Arms Control and Disarmament Agency\n\t+ Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty\n* Flexible response\n* Kennedy Doctrine\n* Peace Corps\n* Trade Expansion Act\n* Migration and Refugee Assistance Act\n* USAID\n* Vietnam War\n* Cuba: Bay of Pigs Invasion\n* Cuban Project\n* Cuban Missile Crisis\n\t+ ExComm\n* Soviet Union: Berlin Crisis\n* Moscow–Washington hotline\n* Vienna summit\n |\n| New Frontier | * Clean Air Act\n* Communications Satellite Act\n* Community Mental Health Act\n* Equal Pay Act\n* Executive Order 11110\n* Federal affirmative action\n* Federal housing segregation ban\n* Fifty-mile hikes\n* Food for Peace\n* Pilot Food Stamp Program\n* Presidential Medal of Freedom\n* Space policy\n* Status of Women (Presidential Commission)\n* University of Alabama integration\n* Voter Education Project\n* All-Channel Receiver Act\n* Oil Pollution Act of 1961\n* Revenue Act of 1962\n* Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act of 1961\n* Wetlands Loan Act\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOf the 24 torpedoes fired that night by eight of the American PTs, not one hit the Japanese convoy.[47] On that dark and moonless night, Kennedy spotted a Japanese destroyer heading north on its return from the base of Kolombangara around 2:00 a.m., and attempted to turn to attack, when *PT-109* was rammed suddenly at an angle and cut in half by the destroyer *Amagiri*, killing two *PT-109* crew members while the others tried to stay afloat amid the wreckage.[48][49][42][a] Avoiding surrender, the remaining crew swam towards Plum Pudding Island, 3.5 miles (5.6 km) southwest of the remains of *PT-109*, on August 2.[42][51] Despite re-injuring his back in the collision, Kennedy towed a badly burned crewman through the water to the island with a life jacket strap clenched between his teeth.[52] From there, Kennedy and his subordinate, Ensign George Ross, made various forays through the coral islands, searching for help.[53] When they encountered an English-speaking native with a canoe, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNavy,[430] and one of the enduring legacies of his administration was the creation in 1961 of another special forces command, the Navy SEALs,[431] which Kennedy enthusiastically supported.[432]\n\n\nKennedy's civil rights proposals led to the Civil Rights Act of 1964.[433] President Lyndon B. Johnson, Kennedy's successor, took up the mantle and pushed the landmark Civil Rights Act through a bitterly divided Congress by invoking the slain president's memory.[434][435] President Johnson then signed the Act into law on July 2, 1964. This civil rights law ended what was known as the \"Solid South\" and certain provisions were modeled after the Civil Rights Act of 1875, signed into law by President Ulysses S.

Clay.[184]\n\n\n\n### Cuba[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe 15-minute ceremony began at 10:30 p.m. Cardinal Patrick O'Boyle, Roman Catholic Archbishop of Washington, officiated at the graveside service in lieu of Cardinal Richard Cushing of Boston, who fell ill during the trip.[373] Also officiating was Archbishop of New York Terence Cooke.[371] On behalf of the United States, John Glenn presented the folded flag to Ted Kennedy, who passed it to Robert's eldest son, Joe, who passed it to Ethel Kennedy. The Navy Band played *The Navy Hymn*.[371]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWhen President Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas on November 22, 1963, RFK was at home with aides from the Justice Department. J. Edgar Hoover called and told him his brother had been shot.[202] Hoover then hung up before he could ask any questions. Kennedy later said he thought Hoover had enjoyed telling him the news.[203] Kennedy then received a call from Tazewell Shepard, a naval aide to the president, who told him that his brother was dead.[202] Shortly after the call from Hoover, Kennedy phoned McGeorge Bundy at the White House, instructing him to change the locks on the president's files. He ordered the Secret Service to dismantle the hidden taping system in the Oval Office and cabinet room. He scheduled a meeting with CIA director John McCone and asked if the CIA had any involvement in his brother's death. McCone denied it, with Kennedy later telling investigator Walter Sheridan that he asked the director \"in a way that he couldn't lie to me, and they [the CIA] hadn't\".[204]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n48. **^** Stuan, Thomas (2006). *The Architecture of Bates College*.

As attorney general, he authorized the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to wiretap Martin Luther King Jr. and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference on a limited basis.[7] After his brother's assassination, he remained in office during the presidency of Lyndon B. Johnson for several months. He left to run for the United States Senate from New York in 1964 and defeated Republican incumbent Kenneth Keating, overcoming criticism that he was a \"carpetbagger\" from Massachusetts.[8][9] In office, Kennedy opposed U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War and raised awareness of poverty by sponsoring legislation designed to lure private business to blighted communities (i.e., Bedford Stuyvesant Restoration project). \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n352. **^** Morriss, John G.

Robert was most affected by his father's reaction to his eldest son's passing. He appeared completely heartbroken, and his peer Fred Garfield commented that Kennedy developed depression and questioned his faith for a short time. After his brother's death, Robert gained more attention, moving higher up the family patriarchy.[51] On December 15, 1945, the U.S. Navy commissioned the destroyer USS *Joseph P.

After the president was interred in Arlington Cemetery, the two infants were buried next to him on December 5, 1963, in a private ceremony without publicity.[371] His brother, Senator Edward M.

He addressed his supporters shortly after midnight on June 5, 1968, in a ballroom at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles.[352] Leaving the ballroom, he went through the hotel kitchen after being told it was a shortcut to a press room.[353] He did this despite being advised by his bodyguard—former FBI agent Bill Barry—to avoid the kitchen. In a crowded kitchen passageway, Kennedy turned to his left and shook hands with hotel busboy Juan Romero just as Sirhan Sirhan, a 24-year-old Palestinian,[354] opened fire with a .22-caliber revolver. Kennedy was hit three times, and five other people were wounded.[355]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n461. **^** \"\"Robert F. Kennedy on Death of Martin L. King\" historical marker\".

Shortly after winning the California primary around midnight on June 5, 1968, Kennedy was shot by Sirhan Sirhan, a 24-year-old Palestinian, allegedly in retaliation for his support of Israel following the 1967 Six-Day War. Kennedy died 25 hours later. Sirhan was arrested, tried, and convicted, though Kennedy's assassination, like his brother's, continues to be the subject of widespread analysis and numerous conspiracy theories.[11]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n250. **^** Schlesinger (1978), p. 676.\n251. **^** Richard Allen, Edwin Guthman (2018). *RFK - His Words for our Times*.

Hilty concludes that Kennedy \"played an unusual combination of roles—campaign director, attorney general, executive overseer, controller of patronage, chief adviser, and brother protector\" and that nobody before him had had such power.[125] His tenure as attorney general was easily the period of greatest power for the office—no previous United States attorney general had enjoyed such clear influence on all areas of policy during an administration.[126] To a great extent, President Kennedy sought the advice and counsel of his younger brother, with Robert being the president's closest political adviser. He was relied upon as both the president's primary source of administrative information and as a general counsel with whom trust was implicit. He exercised widespread authority over every cabinet department, leading the Associated Press to dub him \"Bobby—Washington's No. 2-man\".[126][127]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nClifford's notes indicate that Kennedy was offering not to enter the ongoing Democratic presidential primary if President Johnson would admit publicly to having been wrong in his war policy and appoint \"a group of persons to conduct a study in depth of the issues and come up with a recommended course of action\";[320] Johnson rejected the proposal.[321] On April 1, after President Johnson halted bombing of North Vietnam, RFK said the decision was a \"step toward peace\" and, though offering to collaborate with Johnson for national unity, opted to continue his presidential bid.[322] On May 1, while in Lafayette, Indiana, Kennedy said continued delays in beginning peace talks with North Vietnam meant both more lives lost and the postponing of the \"domestic progress\" hoped for by the US.[323] Later that month, Kennedy called the war \"the gravest kind of error\" in a speech in Corvallis, Oregon.[324] In an interview on June 4, hours before he was shot, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n434. **^** Woods, Jeff (July 1, 2010). \"Governor Reveals Odd Choice for Role Model: RFK\". *Nashville Scene*.

On this trip, the brothers met Liaquat Ali Khan just before his assassination, and India's prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru.[69]\n\n\n\n## Senate committee counsel and political campaigns (1951–1960)[edit]\n\n\n### JFK Senate campaign and Joseph McCarthy (1952–1955)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)President John F.

His father had arranged the nomination, his first national award.[85] In 1955, Kennedy was admitted to practice before the United States Supreme Court.[86]\n\n\n\n### Stevenson aide and focus on organized labor (1956–1960)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nKennedy replied: \"I don't think anyone has ever suggested that I was speaking for the White House\".[308] Kennedy's peace plan made front page news with *The New York Times* calling it a break with the president while the *Chicago Tribunal* labelled him in an editorial \"Ho Chi Kennedy\".[309] Vice President Humphrey on a visit to New Zealand said that Kennedy's \"peace recipe\" included \"a dose of arsenic\" while the National Security Adviser McGeorge Bundy quoted to the press Kennedy's remarks from 1963 saying he was against including Communists in coalition governments (though Kennedy's subject was Germany, not Vietnam).[309] Kennedy was displeased when he heard anti-war protesters chanting his name, saying \"I'm not Wayne Morse\".[309] To put aside reports of a rift with Johnson, Kennedy flew with Johnson on *Air Force One* on a trip to New York on February 23, 1966, and barely clapped his hands in approval when Johnson denied waging a war of conquest in Vietnam.[309] In an interview with the *Today* program, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAt the DNC, Kennedy appeared onstage to introduce a film honoring his late brother, *A Thousand Days*, causing the convention hall to explode with cheers and applause for 22 minutes despite Kennedy's gestures indicating that he wanted the crowd to fall silent so he could begin his speech.[228] Senator Henry Jackson advised Kennedy, \"Let them get it out of their system\" as he stood on the stage raising his hand to end the tumult.[229] When the crowd finally stopped cheering, Kennedy delivered his brief remarks, which ended with a verse from Shakespeare's *Romeo and Juliet*: \"When he shall die, take him and cut him out in little stars, And he will make the face of heaven so fine, That all the world shall be in love with night, and pay no worship to the garish sun\".[229] Johnson knew instantly that the reference to the \"garish sun\" was to him.[230]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Senate (1965–1968)[edit]\n\n\n### 1964 election[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 1964 United States Senate election in New York\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Radio airchecks/recordings of the shooting and death of Senator Kennedy including Mutual Radio's Andrew West's shooting coverage, continued live coverage from CBS Radio, announcements of RFK's death, CBS Radio's complete coverage of funeral mass St. Patrick's Cathedral, and CBS Radio coverage of the train arrival of RFK's body in Washington DC.\n* KTTV assassination coverage Archived September 24, 2015, at the Wayback Machine at The Museum of Classic Chicago Television\n* FBI file on the RFK assassination\n* \"The Robert F.

The Marine Corps Band played *The Battle Hymn of the Republic*.[371] The funeral motorcade arrived at the cemetery at 10:24 pm.

The trust the president placed in him on matters of negotiation was such that his role in the crisis is today seen as having been of vital importance in securing a blockade, which averted a full military engagement between the United States and the Soviet Union.[195] On October 27, Kennedy secretly met with Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin.

Clay.[184]\n\n\n\n### Cuba[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe 15-minute ceremony began at 10:30 p.m. Cardinal Patrick O'Boyle, Roman Catholic Archbishop of Washington, officiated at the graveside service in lieu of Cardinal Richard Cushing of Boston, who fell ill during the trip.[373] Also officiating was Archbishop of New York Terence Cooke.[371] On behalf of the United States, John Glenn presented the folded flag to Ted Kennedy, who passed it to Robert's eldest son, Joe, who passed it to Ethel Kennedy. The Navy Band played *The Navy Hymn*.[371]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWhen President Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas on November 22, 1963, RFK was at home with aides from the Justice Department. J. Edgar Hoover called and told him his brother had been shot.[202] Hoover then hung up before he could ask any questions. Kennedy later said he thought Hoover had enjoyed telling him the news.[203] Kennedy then received a call from Tazewell Shepard, a naval aide to the president, who told him that his brother was dead.[202] Shortly after the call from Hoover, Kennedy phoned McGeorge Bundy at the White House, instructing him to change the locks on the president's files. He ordered the Secret Service to dismantle the hidden taping system in the Oval Office and cabinet room. He scheduled a meeting with CIA director John McCone and asked if the CIA had any involvement in his brother's death. McCone denied it, with Kennedy later telling investigator Walter Sheridan that he asked the director \"in a way that he couldn't lie to me, and they [the CIA] hadn't\".[204]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n48. **^** Stuan, Thomas (2006). *The Architecture of Bates College*.

He left to run for the United States Senate from New York in 1964 and defeated Republican incumbent Kenneth Keating, overcoming criticism that he was a \"carpetbagger\" from Massachusetts.[8][9] In office, Kennedy opposed U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War and raised awareness of poverty by sponsoring legislation designed to lure private business to blighted communities (i.e., Bedford Stuyvesant Restoration project). \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n352. **^** Morriss, John G.

Robert was most affected by his father's reaction to his eldest son's passing. He appeared completely heartbroken, and his peer Fred Garfield commented that Kennedy developed depression and questioned his faith for a short time. After his brother's death, Robert gained more attention, moving higher up the family patriarchy.[51] On December 15, 1945, the U.S. Navy commissioned the destroyer USS *Joseph P. Kennedy Jr.*, and shortly thereafter granted Kennedy's request to be released from naval-officer training to serve aboard *Kennedy* starting on February 1, 1946, as a seaman apprentice on the ship's shakedown cruise in the Caribbean.[49][52] On May 30, 1946, he received his honorable discharge from the Navy.[53] For his service in the Navy, Kennedy was eligible for the American Campaign Medal and the World War II Victory Medal.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nRobert F.

After the president was interred in Arlington Cemetery, the two infants were buried next to him on December 5, 1963, in a private ceremony without publicity.[371] His brother, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, was also buried at night, in 2009.[378]\n\n\nOn June 9, President Johnson assigned security staff to all U.S. presidential candidates and declared an official national day of mourning.[379] After the assassination, the mandate of the U.S. Secret Service was altered by Congress to include the protection of U.S. presidential candidates.[380][381]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n336. **^** \"American Political History Vietnam: Kennedy, Johhson and Escalation\".

In a crowded kitchen passageway, Kennedy turned to his left and shook hands with hotel busboy Juan Romero just as Sirhan Sirhan, a 24-year-old Palestinian,[354] opened fire with a .22-caliber revolver.

He was a malcontent who could not get along here or in the Soviet Union.\"[211] He added, \"I have not read the report, nor do I intend to.

Shortly after winning the California primary around midnight on June 5, 1968, Kennedy was shot by Sirhan Sirhan, a 24-year-old Palestinian, allegedly in retaliation for his support of Israel following the 1967 Six-Day War. Kennedy died 25 hours later. Sirhan was arrested, tried, and convicted, though Kennedy's assassination, like his brother's, continues to be the subject of widespread analysis and numerous conspiracy theories.[11]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n250. **^** Schlesinger (1978), p. 676.\n251. **^** Richard Allen, Edwin Guthman (2018). *RFK - His Words for our Times*.

Hilty concludes that Kennedy \"played an unusual combination of roles—campaign director, attorney general, executive overseer, controller of patronage, chief adviser, and brother protector\" and that nobody before him had had such power.[125] His tenure as attorney general was easily the period of greatest power for the office—no previous United States attorney general had enjoyed such clear influence on all areas of policy during an administration.[126] To a great extent, President Kennedy sought the advice and counsel of his younger brother, with Robert being the president's closest political adviser. He was relied upon as both the president's primary source of administrative information and as a general counsel with whom trust was implicit. He exercised widespread authority over every cabinet department, leading the Associated Press to dub him \"Bobby—Washington's No. 2-man\".[126][127]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nClifford's notes indicate that Kennedy was offering not to enter the ongoing Democratic presidential primary if President Johnson would admit publicly to having been wrong in his war policy and appoint \"a group of persons to conduct a study in depth of the issues and come up with a recommended course of action\";[320] Johnson rejected the proposal.[321] On April 1, after President Johnson halted bombing of North Vietnam, RFK said the decision was a \"step toward peace\" and, though offering to collaborate with Johnson for national unity, opted to continue his presidential bid.[322] On May 1, while in Lafayette, Indiana, Kennedy said continued delays in beginning peace talks with North Vietnam meant both more lives lost and the postponing of the \"domestic progress\" hoped for by the US.[323] Later that month, Kennedy called the war \"the gravest kind of error\" in a speech in Corvallis, Oregon.[324] In an interview on June 4, hours before he was shot, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n434. **^** Woods, Jeff (July 1, 2010). \"Governor Reveals Odd Choice for Role Model: RFK\". *Nashville Scene*.

On May 28, Kennedy lost the Oregon primary, marking the first time a Kennedy lost an election, and it was assumed that McCarthy was the preferred choice among the young voters.[351] If he could defeat McCarthy in the California primary, the leadership of the campaign thought, he would knock McCarthy out of the race and set up a one-on-one against Vice President Humphrey at the Democratic National Convention in August.\n\n\n\n## Assassination[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Assassination of Robert F.

During this time, Robert McNamara was serving as Secretary of Defense and one of John F. Kennedy's trusted advisors. When Kennedy received confirmation of the placement of offensive Soviet missiles in Cuba, he immediately set up the 'Executive Committee', referred to as 'ExComm'. This committee included United States government officials, such as Robert McNamara, advising Kennedy on the crisis. Kennedy instructed ExComm to immediately come up with a response to the Soviet threat unanimously without him present.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWith tensions continuing to escalate, it was confirmed[*by whom?*] the crisis had to be resolved within 48 hours when the White House received two messages from Nikita Khrushchev. The first message, an informal one, stated if the United States guaranteed to not invade Cuba then they would take the missiles out. The second message, a more formal one, was broadcast on the radio stating if the United States attacked then Cuba was prepared to retaliate with masses of military power. Although American defense planning focused on using nuclear weapons, Kennedy and McNamara saw it was clear the use of strategic weapons could be suicidal.[36] Following Cuba's aftermath, McNamara stated, \"There is no such thing as strategy, only crisis management.\"[36]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962, McNamara served as a member of EXCOMM and played a large role in the Administration's handling and eventual defusing of the Cuban Missile Crisis. He was a strong proponent of the blockade option over a missile strike and helped persuade the Joint Chiefs of Staff to agree with the blockade option.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* *Cuban Missile Crisis Revisited*.

Kennedy and McNamara instituted a Cold War defense strategy of flexible response, which anticipated the need for military responses short of massive retaliation. McNamara consolidated intelligence and logistics functions of the Pentagon into two centralized agencies: the Defense Intelligence Agency and the Defense Supply Agency. During the Kennedy administration, McNamara presided over a build-up of U.S. soldiers in South Vietnam. After the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin incident, the number of U.S. soldiers in Vietnam escalated dramatically. McNamara and other U.S. policymakers feared that the fall of South Vietnam to a Communist regime would lead to the fall of other governments in the region.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n31. **^** Amadae, SM (2003). \"Chapter 1\". *Rationalizing Capitalist Democracy: The Cold War Origins of Rational Choice Liberalism*.

The majority of officials favored an air attack on Cuba in hopes to destroy the missile sites, although the vote was not unanimous which brought them to other alternatives. By the end of the week, ExComm came up with four different alternative strategies to present to the president: a blockade, an air strike, an invasion, or some combination of these.[35] These actions are known as OPLAN 312, OPLAN 314 and OPLAN 316. A quarantine was a way to prevent the Soviets from bringing any military equipment in or out of Cuba.[36] During the final review of both alternatives on Sunday, October 21, upon Kennedy's request, McNamara presented the argument against the attack and for the quarantine. On Wednesday, October 24 at 10:00 am EDT, the quarantine line around Cuba went into effect.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter the crisis, McNamara recommended to Kennedy that Admiral Anderson and General LeMay be sacked.[34] However, Kennedy was afraid of a Congressional backlash if he sacked two of the chiefs at once.[37] Moreover, Kennedy did not wish for his disagreements with the Joint Chiefs to become public and felt that sacking two of the chiefs at once would lead to speculation in the media about such a disagreement. Kennedy told McNamara: \"All right, you can fire one. Which one will it be?\"[37] Without hesitation, McNamara answered \"Anderson\".[37] Later on in 1963, a White House release announced that Admiral Anderson was the new American ambassador to Portugal.[37]\n\n\n\n### Cost reductions[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Robert S.

Kennedy rejected the concept of first-strike attack and emphasized the need for adequate strategic arms and defense to deter nuclear attack on the United States and its allies. U.S. arms, he maintained, must constantly be under civilian command and control, and the nation's defense posture had to be \"designed to reduce the danger of irrational or unpremeditated general war.\" The primary mission of U.S. overseas forces, in cooperation with its allies, was \"to prevent the steady erosion of the Free World through limited wars\". Kennedy and McNamara rejected massive retaliation for a posture of flexible response. The U.S. wanted choices in an emergency other than \"inglorious retreat or unlimited retaliation\", as the president put it.

Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson. He remains the longest-serving secretary of defense, having remained in office over seven years.

This was the same nuclear strategy planned by the Strategic Air Command (SAC), led by General Curtis LeMay. McNamara did not agree with this approach. He sought other options after seeing that this strategy could not guarantee the destruction of all Soviet nuclear weapons, thus leaving the United States vulnerable to retaliation. He educated NATO members on the Cold War doctrine of deterrence.[27][*further explanation needed*] McNamara's alternative in the doctrine of counterforce was to try to limit the United States nuclear exchange by targeting only enemy military forces.[28] This would prevent retaliation and escalation by holding Soviet cities hostage to a follow-up strike. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNavy destroyer by allegedly withholding recommendations from US Pacific Commanders against executing airstrikes.[93] McNamara was also instrumental in presenting the event to Congress and the public as justification for escalation of the war against the communists.[94] Decades later after the fact in 1995, McNamara met with former North Vietnam Defense Minister Võ Nguyên Giáp, who told his American counterpart that the August 4 attack never happened, a conclusion McNamara eventually came to accept.[95]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAt the end of his life McNamara was a life trustee on the Board of Trustees of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), a trustee of the Economists for Peace and Security, a trustee of the American University of Nigeria, and an honorary trustee for the Brookings Institution.\n\n\nMcNamara died at his home in Washington, D.C., at 5:30 am on July 6, 2009, at the age of 93.[216][217] He is buried at the Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington County, Virginia, with the grave marker also commemorating his wives.[218]\n\n\nMcNamara's papers from his years as Secretary of Defense are housed in the John F.

By 1967, McNamara was suffering visibly from the nervous strain as he went days without shaving and he suffered spasms where his jaw would quiver uncontrollably for hours.[166] Johnson said about him: \"You know, he's a fine man, a wonderful man, Bob McNamara. He has given everything, just about everything, and, you know, we just can't afford another Forrestal\" (a reference to the first Defense Secretary, James Forrestal, who committed suicide due to work-related stress and depression).[166]  \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara with U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff General Curtis LeMay at The Pentagon on April 10, 1963.

In response to McNamara's claim that the Joint Chiefs supported him, he proposed that the Joint Chiefs all resign in protest at McNamara's leadership.[177] General Harold K. Johnson of the Army, who erroneously blamed McNamara for Johnson's decision not to call up the Reserves in 1965, agreed to Wheeler's plan with his only regret being that he did not resign in 1965.[178] The plan collapsed when General Wallace M. Greene of the Marine Corps refused to go along with it.[178]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nKennedy had emerged as a leading critic of the war by 1967, and Johnson stated to Kearns his belief that McNamara had suffered a nervous breakdown, of which Kennedy, a close friend of McNamara, had taken advantage of.[175] Johnson told Kearns: \"Every day, Bobby [Kennedy] would call up McNamara telling him that the war was terrible and immoral, and that he had to leave\".[175] To soften the blow, Johnson claimed to Kearns that he had talked it over with McNamara and had decided to offer him the presidency of the World Bank, \"the only job he really wanted then\".[175] Johnson had chosen the job of World Bank president for McNamara because its rules prohibited the president from involving himself in the domestic affairs of member nations, which would prevent McNamara from criticizing the war after he left office.[176] Johnson's biggest fear was that if he fired McNamara, then he might join with Kennedy in criticizing him and the war; given his status as the longest-serving Defense Secretary, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn September 29, 1972, a passenger on the ferry to Martha's Vineyard recognized McNamara on board and attempted to throw him into the ocean. McNamara declined to press charges. The man remained anonymous but was interviewed years later by author Paul Hendrickson, who quoted the attacker as saying, \"I just wanted to confront (McNamara) on Vietnam.\"[213]\n\n\n\n### Final years and death[edit]\n\n\nAfter his wife's death, McNamara dated Katharine Graham, with whom he had been friends since the early 1960s.[*citation needed*] Graham died in 2001.\n\n\nIn September 2004, McNamara wed Diana Masieri Byfield, an Italian-born widow who had lived in the United States for more than 40 years. It was her second marriage. She was married to Ernest Byfield, a former OSS officer and Chicago hotel owner, thirty years her senior, whose first wife, Gladys Rosenthal Tartiere, leased her 400-acre (1.6 km²) Glen Ora estate in Middleburg, Virginia, to John F. Kennedy during his presidency.[214][215]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMcNamara took other steps to increase U.S. deterrence posture and military capabilities. He raised the proportion of Strategic Air Command (SAC) strategic bombers on 15-minute ground alert from 25% to 50%, thus lessening their vulnerability to missile attack. In December 1961, he established the United States Strike Command (STRICOM). Authorized to draw forces when needed from the Strategic Army Corps (STRAC), the Tactical Air Command, and the airlift units of the Military Air Transport Service and the military services, Strike Command had the mission \"to respond swiftly and with whatever force necessary to threats against the peace in any part of the world, reinforcing unified commands or... carrying out separate contingency operations.\" McNamara also increased long-range airlift and sealift capabilities and funds for space research and development. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHe witnessed hippie girls placing flowers in the guns of the D.C National Guardsman standing in front of the Pentagon.[179] McNamara described the scene as \"hellish\" as the hippie girls bared their breasts to tempt the Guardsman to \"make love, not war\" while other hippies spat in the faces of the Guardsmen.[179] However, despite seeing the March on the Pentagon demonstrators as a sign of social decay, his characteristic competitive spirit came to the fore as he argued that if he had been leading the March on the Pentagon, he would have taken over the Pentagon and shut it down, saying hippies lacked the necessary discipline and intelligence.[179] On 31 October 1967, McNamara wrote Johnson a memo which he sent the next day saying that the war could not be continued as it \"would be dangerous, costly in lives and unsatisfactory to the American people\".[180] Johnson wrote on the margins on the memo remarks such as \"How do we get this conclusion?\" and \"Why believe this?\"[180]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Kennedy and McNamara with Iran's Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi in April 1962\nThe Draft Presidential Memorandum (DPM)—intended for the White House and usually prepared by the systems analysis office—was a method to study and analyze major defense issues. Sixteen DPMs appeared between 1961 and 1968 on such topics as strategic offensive and defensive forces, NATO strategy and force structure, military assistance, and tactical air forces. OSD sent the DPMs to the services and the Joint Chief of Staff (JCS) for comment; in making decisions, McNamara included in the DPM a statement of alternative approaches, force levels, and other factors. The DPM in its final form became a decision document. The DPM was hated by the JCS and uniformed military in that it cut their ability to communicate directly to the White House.[29] The DPMs were also disliked because the systems analysis process was so heavyweight that it was impossible for any service to effectively challenge its conclusions.[29]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)McNamara pointing to a map of Vietnam at a press conference in April 1965\n![](image)McNamara, South Vietnamese PM Nguyễn Cao Kỳ and President Johnson in Honolulu in February 1966\nDuring President John F.

He returned to Harvard in August 1940 to teach accounting in the Business School and became the institution's highest-paid and youngest assistant professor at that time.[12] Following his involvement there in a program to teach analytical approaches used in business to officers of the United States Army Air Forces, he entered the USAAF as a captain in early 1943, serving most of World War II with its Office of Statistical Control. One of his major responsibilities was the analysis of U.S. bombers' efficiency and effectiveness, especially the B-29 forces commanded by Major General Curtis LeMay in India, China, and the Mariana Islands.[13] McNamara established a statistical control unit for the XX Bomber Command and devised schedules for B-29s doubling as transports for carrying fuel and cargo over The Hump. He left active duty in 1946 with the rank of lieutenant colonel and with a Legion of Merit.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nurging support for a coup while the Pentagon was opposed, Kennedy vacillated and finally being unable to make up his mind, gave the power of decision to Lodge.[72] Lodge, who detested Diệm, gave his approval to the generals plotting against him.[73]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn November 1965, McNamara, who had been a supporter of the war, first started to have doubts about the war, saying at a press conference that \"it will be a long war\", which completely contradicted his previous optimistic statements that the war would be brought to a close soon.[121] Although he was a prime architect of the Vietnam War and repeatedly overruled the JCS on strategic matters, McNamara gradually became skeptical about whether the war could be won by deploying more troops to South Vietnam and intensifying the bombing of North Vietnam, a claim he published in a book years later. He also stated later that his support of the war was given out of loyalty to administration policy. He traveled to South Vietnam many times to study the situation firsthand and became increasingly reluctant to approve the large force increments requested by the military commanders.[124][*not specific enough to verify*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn an interview, McNamara said that the Domino Theory was the main reason for entering the Vietnam War. He also stated, \"Kennedy hadn't said before he died whether, faced with the loss of Vietnam, he would [completely] withdraw; but I believe today that had he faced that choice, he would have withdrawn.\"[147]\n\n\n\n### Equality of opportunity[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\ninitiated by McNamara in 1961 came a decision to increase the nation's \"limited warfare\" capabilities. These moves were significant because McNamara was abandoning President Dwight D. Eisenhower's policy of massive retaliation in favor of a flexible response strategy that relied on increased U.S. capacity to conduct limited, non-nuclear warfare.\n\n\nThe Kennedy administration placed particular emphasis on improving the ability to counter communist \"wars of national liberation\", in which the enemy avoided head-on military confrontation and resorted to political subversion and guerrilla tactics. As McNamara said in his 1962 annual report, \"The military tactics are those of the sniper, the ambush, and the raid. The political tactics are terror, extortion, and assassination.\" In practical terms, this meant training and equipping U.S. military personnel, as well as allies such as South Vietnam, for counterinsurgency operations.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the Kennedy administration, McNamara was closely allied in debates in the cabinet with Dean Rusk, the Secretary of State, with both favoring greater American support for South Vietnam.[45] Initially, the main concern of the new Kennedy administration was Laos, not South Vietnam. In February 1961, McNamara spoke in favor of intervention in Laos, saying that six AT-6 planes owned by the Central Intelligence Agency could be fitted to carry 200-pound bombs in support of General Phoumi Nosavan's forces.[46] Rusk shot down that proposal, saying his World War II experiences in Burma had taught him that bombing was ineffective in the jungles and six planes were not enough.[46] In the spring of 1961 Kennedy seriously considered intervening in Laos where the Communist Pathet Lao, supported by North Vietnam, were winning the civil war.[47] At one point, the Joint Chiefs of Staff advised sending 60,000 U.S. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBesides Stennis, the other members of the Senate Armed Forces Committee were senators Henry M. Jackson, Strom Thurmond and Stuart Symington, all of whom were very hostile to McNamara in their questioning of him.[170] Senator Thurmond reproached McNamara: \"I think it is a statement of placating the Communists. It is a statement of appeasing the Communists. It is a statement of no-win\".[172] Privately, McNamara felt that Thurmond was an \"ass\", saying he was a bigoted, ignorant Southern politician whose only values were a mindless militarism, a fervent belief in white supremacy and a fondness for marrying women far younger than himself. McNamara felt that it was beneath him to be questioned by Thurmond, which explained why he was notably truculent in his answers to him.[172]    \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMcNamara commissioned the Vietnam Study Task Force on June 17, 1967. He was inspired by the confrontation at Harvard the previous November as he had discovered that the students he had been debating knew more about Vietnam's history than he did.[138] The task was assigned to Gelb and six officials whom McNamara instructed to examine just how and why the United States became involved in Vietnam, by answering his list of 100 questions starting with American relations with the Viet Minh in World War II.[139][140] McNamara expected them to be done by September 1967; they finished by January 1969.[140] Though Gelb was a hawk who had written pro-war speeches for the Republican Senator Jacob Javits, he and his team, which grew to 36 members by 1969, became disillusioned as they wrote the history; at one point when discussing what were the lessons of Vietnam, future general Paul F. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Development Concept Paper examined performance, schedule, cost estimates, and technical risks to provide a basis for determining whether to begin or continue a research and development program.[32] But in practice, what it proved to be was a cost burden that became a barrier to entry for companies attempting to deal with the military. It aided the trend toward a few large non-competitive defense contractors serving the military. Rather than serving any useful purpose, the overhead necessary to generate information that was often in practice ignored resulted in increased costs throughout the system.[32]\n\n\nThe Readiness, Information, and Control Tables provided data on specific projects, more detailed than in the FYDP, such as the tables for the Southeast Asia Deployment Plan, which recorded by month and quarter the schedule for deployment, consumption rates, and future projections of U.S. forces in Southeast Asia.\n\n\n\n### Cuban Missile Crisis[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Truman and Eisenhower administrations had committed the United States to support the French and native anti-Communist forces in Vietnam in resisting efforts by the Communists in the North to unify the country, though neither administration established actual combat forces in the war. The U.S. role—initially limited to financial support, military advice and covert intelligence gathering—expanded after 1954 when the French withdrew. During the Kennedy administration, the U.S. military advisory group in South Vietnam steadily increased, with McNamara's concurrence, from 900 to 16,000.[42] U.S. involvement escalated after the Gulf of Tonkin incidents in August 1964, involving two purported attacks on a U.S. Navy destroyer by North Vietnamese naval vessels.[44]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nGorman, one of the historians, went up to the blackboard to write simply, \"Don't.\"[141] The team counted Gelb, Gorman, Melvin Gurtov, Hans Heymann, Richard Moorstein, Daniel Ellsberg, Richard Holbrooke, John Galvin, Paul Warnke and Morton Halperin among its members.[140][142][143]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n38. **^** \"SecDef Histories – Robert McNamara\".

The U.S. nuclear policy remained the same.\n\n\n### Other steps[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAir Force about 700 aircraft shot down over North Vietnam whose total value was about $900 million, making the bombing campaign uneconomical.[134] McNamara's doubts were encouraged by his civilian aides such as Leslie H. Gelb and John McNaughton, who complained that their wives and teenage children were chiding them as \"war criminals\" when they came home from work.[135] McNamara's own teenage son, Robert Craig McNamara, was opposed to the war and denounced his father when he came from work every day.[136] McNamara was shocked to discover that the American flag was hanging upside down in his son's bedroom as the younger McNamara told him that he was ashamed of America because of him.[130] McNaughton told McNamara that after having talked to some of the young people that \"a feeling is widely and strongly held...that 'the Establishment' is out of its mind\" and the dominant opinion was \"that we are trying to impose some U.S. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSenator John C. Stennis was a conservative Southern Democrat who enjoyed much influence as a senior member of the Senate Armed Forces Committee.[167] Stennis saw himself more as a champion of the military rather than its overseer, and as such the military often leaked information to him, in the full knowledge that he would take up their cause on Capitol Hill.[168] Reflecting their unhappiness with McNamara's leadership, in the spring of 1967 senior generals and admirals let Stennis know of their belief that the Defense Secretary was mismanaging the war. This led Stennis to schedule hearings for the Senate Armed Forces Committee in August 1967 to examine the charge that \"unskilled civilian amateurs\" (i.e. McNamara) were not letting \"professional military experts\" win the war. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe casualty lists mounted as the number of troops and the intensity of fighting escalated. McNamara put in place a statistical strategy for victory in Vietnam. He concluded that there were a limited number of VC fighters in South Vietnam and that a war of attrition would destroy them. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHerrick of the *Maddox* reported that the \"torpedo boats\" were almost certainly just radar \"blips\" caused by the \"freak weather effects\" of the storm and the reports of an attack on his ship were due to an \"overeager\" radar operator who mistook the motors of the ship for the rush of torpedoes.[90] Johnson promptly seized upon the reports of an attack on a Navy warship in international waters to ask Congress to pass a resolution giving him the authority to wage war in Vietnam.[90] McNamara, via Admiral U. S. Grant Sharp Jr. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe hearings opened on 8 August 1967, and Stennis called as his witnesses numerous admirals and Air Force generals who all testified to their belief that the United States was fighting with \"one arm tied behind its back\", implicitly criticizing McNamara's leadership. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nToward the end of his term McNamara also opposed an anti-ballistic missile (ABM) system proposed for installation in the U.S. in defense against Soviet missiles, arguing the $40 billion \"in itself is not the problem; the penetrability of the proposed shield is the problem.\"[161] Under pressure to proceed with the ABM program after it became clear that the Soviets had begun a similar project, McNamara finally agreed to a \"light\" system which he believed could protect against the far smaller number of Chinese missiles. However, he never believed it was wise for the United States to move in that direction because of psychological risks of relying too much on nuclear weaponry and that there would be pressure from many directions to build a larger system than would be militarily effective.[162]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA safe was installed in McNamara's office at the World Bank to house his papers relating to his time as Defense Secretary, which was a normal courtesy extended to former Defense Secretaries who might face controversy over their actions and wish to defend themselves by quoting from the documentary record.[141] When the Pentagon Papers were finished in April 1969, and a copy of the Papers were brought into McNamara's office, he became angry and said: \"I don't want to see it! Take it back!\"[141] By 1969, McNamara wanted to forget the Vietnam war and did not want any reminders of his former job.[192]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nStennis wrote the committee's report which accused McNamara of having \"consistently overruled the unanimous recommendations of military commanders and the joint chiefs of staff\", whom Stennis wrote had proposed \"systematic, timely and hard-hitting actions\".[170] Stennis damned McNamara for putting in bombing restrictions to protect North Vietnamese civilians and claimed that the war could be easily won if only McNamara would just obey all of the advice he received from the military.[170] Stennis was not influenced by the hearings as he had written the committee's report before the hearings had even began.[170] Johnson saw the hearings as proof that it was time to dismiss McNamara, whom he believed was \"cracking up\" under the strain of the war, as reflected in the Defense Secretary's criticism of the Rolling Thunder bombings.[173] Stennis, an ardent white supremacist who had fiercely opposed Johnson's civil rights legislation, was an old enemy of Johnson's, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nDefense Intelligence Agency\n |\n| --- |\n| Subordinate organizations | * Defense Clandestine Service\n* Defense Attaché System\n* Defense Cover Office\n* Missile and Space Intelligence Center\n* National Center for Medical Intelligence\n* National Media Exploitation Center\n* Joint Intelligence Operations Center Europe Analytic Center/Joint Intelligence Center\n* National Intelligence University\n* Joint Functional Component Command for Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance\n | ![](image)\n |\n| Projects, operations, and programs | * Project Socrates\n* Stargate Project\n* Able Danger\n* Iraq Survey Group\n* Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System\n* Soviet Military Power\n |\n| Oversight | * United States Secretary of Defense\n* Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence\n* Military Intelligence Board\n* Director of National Intelligence\n* United States Intelligence Community\n* United States Department of Defense\n* SSCI\n* HPSCI\n |\n| People | * Robert McNamara\n* Directors\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\"The fundamental issue of Tonkin Gulf involved not deception but, rather, misuse of power bestowed by the resolution,\" McNamara wrote later.[97] Though Johnson now had the authority to wage war, he proved reluctant to use it, for example by ignoring the advice of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to bomb North Vietnam after a VC attack on Bien Hoa Air Base killed five Americans and destroyed 5 B-57 bombers.[98] Knowing of Johnson's hesitance, on 1 December 1964 McNamara recommended a \"graduated\" response program, urging Johnson to launch Operation Barrel Roll, a bombing offensive against North Vietnamese supply lines along the Ho Chi Minh Trail in the southern part of Laos, which was approved by the president.[99] On Christmas Eve 1964, the VC bombed the Brinks Hotel in Saigon, killing two Americans.[100] Despite McNamara's recommendations to bomb North Vietnam, Johnson still hesitated.[101]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHarkins, the officers of the Military Assistance Command, Vietnam altered a map that showed too much of South Vietnam under Viet Cong control, and massaged the statistics to make the Viet Cong appear weaker than they were.[57] McNamara's \"quantitative\" style based upon much number-crunching by computers about trends in Vietnam missed the human dimension.[56] Aspects of the war such as popular views and attitudes in South Vietnam, and that the South Vietnamese president Ngô Đình Diệm favored a \"divide and rule\" strategy of having multiple government departments compete against one another as a way of staying in power were missed by McNamara's \"quantitative\" approach as there was no way that computers could calculate these aspects of the war.[56] Though McNamara had supported plans to intervene in Laos in 1961, by 1962 he had changed his mind.[58] During a discussion with General Lyman Lemnitzer, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* *The Essence of Security: Reflections in Office.* New York: Harper & Row, 1968.\n* *One Hundred Countries, Two Billion People: The Dimensions of Development.* New York: Praeger, 1973.\n* *The McNamara Years at the World Bank: Major Policy Addresses of Robert S.

The secretary believed that the United States could afford any amount needed for national security, but that \"this ability does not excuse us from applying strict standards of effectiveness and efficiency to the way we spend our defense dollars.... You have to make a judgment on how much is enough.\"[*citation needed*] Acting on these principles, McNamara instituted a much-publicized cost reduction program, which, he reported, saved $14 billion in the five-year period beginning in 1961. Although he had to withstand a storm of criticism from senators and representatives from affected congressional districts, he closed many military bases and installations that he judged unnecessary for national security. He was equally determined about other cost-saving measures.[38]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n142. **^** \"Paul C.

Kennedy asked McNamara to tape a statement praising his leadership during the Cuban Missile Crisis with the understanding that the statement was meant for a TV ad.[166] McNamara praised Kennedy's \"shrewd diplomacy\", saying he had \"remained calm and cool, firm, but restrained, never nettled and never rattled\".[192] Though this was a violation of World Bank rules, McNamara felt guilty over refusing Kennedy's requests to resign and decline the World Bank presidency.[192] He was attacked for the tape with the *New York Times* in an editorial lambasting him for his \"poor judgement and poorer taste\".[192] For a moment, McNamara feared he would be fired from the World Bank.[192]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn April 1964, Senator Wayne Morse called the war \"McNamara's War\".[83] In response, McNamara told the press that he was honored, saying \"I think it is a very important war, and I am pleased to be identified with it and do whatever I can to win it\".[84] In May 1964, Senator Richard Russell advised Johnson against relying too much on McNamara, saying \"McNamara is the smartest fella any of us know. But he's got too much-he's opinionated as hell-and he's made up his mind\".[84] Russell told Johnson that he should find an expert, preferably a World War II general who was \"not scared to death of McNamara\" to go to South Vietnam to say that the war was unwinnable and that the United States should pull out, advice that Johnson rejected.[83]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nparticularly if these statistics were compared like baseball standings and there were no stringent requirements as to how and by whom the counts were to be made\".[120] The obsession with \"body counts\" led to much exaggeration of the losses inflicted on the enemy as the officers with the highest \"body counts\" were promoted while also fueling a grisly competition between units to achieve the highest \"body counts\" that led to innocent civilians being killed to inflate their daily \"body counts\". It is generally accepted by historians that the vast daily losses that U.S. officers claimed to have inflicted on the VC were fabricated as many officers desperate for a promotion reported \"body counts\" well above what they were actually achieving.[120]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn February 1965, the VC attacked the American airfield at Pleiku, killing 8 Americans and destroying 10 aircraft.[104] After hearing of the attack, Johnson assembled his national security team together with the Speaker of the House of Representatives, John W. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMcCormack, and the Senate Majority Leader, Mike Mansfield, to announce \"I've had enough of this\".[105] Only Mansfield and the Vice President, Hubert Humphrey, objected to Johnson's plans to bomb North Vietnam.[105] Aircraft from the carrier, USS *Ranger*, launched Operation Flaming Dart bombing the North Vietnamese army base at Đồng Hới later that day.[105] McNamara was forced to tell Johnson that the Flaming Dart raids had done little damage owing to the heavy clouds, which caused the pilots to miss when dropping their bombs, and more raids would be needed.[106] On 11 February, Johnson ordered more bombing raids, and 2 March approved Operation Rolling Thunder, a strategic bombing offensive against North Vietnam that was originally planned to last eight weeks, and instead went on for three years.[107] After the bombing raids started, General William Westmoreland of the Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV), \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWhen working at Ford Motor Company, McNamara resided in Ann Arbor, Michigan, rather than the usual auto executive domains of Grosse Pointe, Birmingham, and Bloomfield Hills.

This goddamned bombing campaign, it's worth nothing, it's done nothing, they dropped more bombs than on all of Europe in all of World War II and it hasn't done a fucking thing!\"[188] McNamara then broke down in tears, saying to Johnson to just accept that the war could not be won and stop listening to Rostow.[189] Henry McPherson, an aide to the president, recalled the scene: \"He reeled off the familiar statistics-how we had dropped more bombs on Vietnam than on all of Europe during World War II. Then his voice broke, and there were tears on his eyes as he spoke of the futility, the crushing futility of the air war. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe rest of us sat silently-I for one with my mouth open, listening to the secretary of defense talk that way about a campaign for which he had, ultimately, been responsible. I was pretty shocked\".[190]  \n\n\nShortly after McNamara departed the Pentagon, he published *The Essence of Security*, discussing various aspects of his tenure and position on basic national security issues.

During this time, Robert McNamara was serving as Secretary of Defense and one of John F. Kennedy's trusted advisors. When Kennedy received confirmation of the placement of offensive Soviet missiles in Cuba, he immediately set up the 'Executive Committee', referred to as 'ExComm'. This committee included United States government officials, such as Robert McNamara, advising Kennedy on the crisis. Kennedy instructed ExComm to immediately come up with a response to the Soviet threat unanimously without him present.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWith tensions continuing to escalate, it was confirmed[*by whom?*] the crisis had to be resolved within 48 hours when the White House received two messages from Nikita Khrushchev. The first message, an informal one, stated if the United States guaranteed to not invade Cuba then they would take the missiles out. The second message, a more formal one, was broadcast on the radio stating if the United States attacked then Cuba was prepared to retaliate with masses of military power. Although American defense planning focused on using nuclear weapons, Kennedy and McNamara saw it was clear the use of strategic weapons could be suicidal.[36] Following Cuba's aftermath, McNamara stated, \"There is no such thing as strategy, only crisis management.\"[36]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962, McNamara served as a member of EXCOMM and played a large role in the Administration's handling and eventual defusing of the Cuban Missile Crisis. He was a strong proponent of the blockade option over a missile strike and helped persuade the Joint Chiefs of Staff to agree with the blockade option.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* *Cuban Missile Crisis Revisited*.

Kennedy and McNamara instituted a Cold War defense strategy of flexible response, which anticipated the need for military responses short of massive retaliation. McNamara consolidated intelligence and logistics functions of the Pentagon into two centralized agencies: the Defense Intelligence Agency and the Defense Supply Agency. During the Kennedy administration, McNamara presided over a build-up of U.S. soldiers in South Vietnam. After the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin incident, the number of U.S. soldiers in Vietnam escalated dramatically. McNamara and other U.S. policymakers feared that the fall of South Vietnam to a Communist regime would lead to the fall of other governments in the region.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n31. **^** Amadae, SM (2003). \"Chapter 1\". *Rationalizing Capitalist Democracy: The Cold War Origins of Rational Choice Liberalism*.

The majority of officials favored an air attack on Cuba in hopes to destroy the missile sites, although the vote was not unanimous which brought them to other alternatives. By the end of the week, ExComm came up with four different alternative strategies to present to the president: a blockade, an air strike, an invasion, or some combination of these.[35] These actions are known as OPLAN 312, OPLAN 314 and OPLAN 316. A quarantine was a way to prevent the Soviets from bringing any military equipment in or out of Cuba.[36] During the final review of both alternatives on Sunday, October 21, upon Kennedy's request, McNamara presented the argument against the attack and for the quarantine. On Wednesday, October 24 at 10:00 am EDT, the quarantine line around Cuba went into effect.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter the crisis, McNamara recommended to Kennedy that Admiral Anderson and General LeMay be sacked.[34] However, Kennedy was afraid of a Congressional backlash if he sacked two of the chiefs at once.[37] Moreover, Kennedy did not wish for his disagreements with the Joint Chiefs to become public and felt that sacking two of the chiefs at once would lead to speculation in the media about such a disagreement. Kennedy told McNamara: \"All right, you can fire one. Which one will it be?\"[37] Without hesitation, McNamara answered \"Anderson\".[37] Later on in 1963, a White House release announced that Admiral Anderson was the new American ambassador to Portugal.[37]\n\n\n\n### Cost reductions[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Robert S.

Kennedy rejected the concept of first-strike attack and emphasized the need for adequate strategic arms and defense to deter nuclear attack on the United States and its allies. U.S. arms, he maintained, must constantly be under civilian command and control, and the nation's defense posture had to be \"designed to reduce the danger of irrational or unpremeditated general war.\" The primary mission of U.S. overseas forces, in cooperation with its allies, was \"to prevent the steady erosion of the Free World through limited wars\". Kennedy and McNamara rejected massive retaliation for a posture of flexible response. The U.S. wanted choices in an emergency other than \"inglorious retreat or unlimited retaliation\", as the president put it.

Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson. He remains the longest-serving secretary of defense, having remained in office over seven years.

This was the same nuclear strategy planned by the Strategic Air Command (SAC), led by General Curtis LeMay. McNamara did not agree with this approach. He sought other options after seeing that this strategy could not guarantee the destruction of all Soviet nuclear weapons, thus leaving the United States vulnerable to retaliation. He educated NATO members on the Cold War doctrine of deterrence.[27][*further explanation needed*] McNamara's alternative in the doctrine of counterforce was to try to limit the United States nuclear exchange by targeting only enemy military forces.[28] This would prevent retaliation and escalation by holding Soviet cities hostage to a follow-up strike. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNavy destroyer by allegedly withholding recommendations from US Pacific Commanders against executing airstrikes.[93] McNamara was also instrumental in presenting the event to Congress and the public as justification for escalation of the war against the communists.[94] Decades later after the fact in 1995, McNamara met with former North Vietnam Defense Minister Võ Nguyên Giáp, who told his American counterpart that the August 4 attack never happened, a conclusion McNamara eventually came to accept.[95]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAt the end of his life McNamara was a life trustee on the Board of Trustees of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), a trustee of the Economists for Peace and Security, a trustee of the American University of Nigeria, and an honorary trustee for the Brookings Institution.\n\n\nMcNamara died at his home in Washington, D.C., at 5:30 am on July 6, 2009, at the age of 93.[216][217] He is buried at the Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington County, Virginia, with the grave marker also commemorating his wives.[218]\n\n\nMcNamara's papers from his years as Secretary of Defense are housed in the John F.

By 1967, McNamara was suffering visibly from the nervous strain as he went days without shaving and he suffered spasms where his jaw would quiver uncontrollably for hours.[166] Johnson said about him: \"You know, he's a fine man, a wonderful man, Bob McNamara. He has given everything, just about everything, and, you know, we just can't afford another Forrestal\" (a reference to the first Defense Secretary, James Forrestal, who committed suicide due to work-related stress and depression).[166]  \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara with U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff General Curtis LeMay at The Pentagon on April 10, 1963.

Kennedy and McNamara, 1962After his election in 1960, President-elect John F. Kennedy first offered the post of Secretary of Defense to Robert A. Lovett, who had already served in that position in the Truman administration; Lovett declined but recommended McNamara. Kennedy had read about McNamara and his career in a *Time* magazine article on December 2, 1960, and interviewed him on December 8, with his brother and right-hand man Robert F. Kennedy also being present.[18] McNamara told Kennedy that he didn't know anything about government, to which Kennedy replied: \"We can learn our jobs together. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nsuch criticism would be especially damaging.[176] \n\n\nWhen a reporter asked McNamara if the Stennis hearings indicated a rift between him and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, McNamara replied: \"My polices don't differ with those of the Joint Chiefs and I think they would be the first to say it\".[177] General Earle \"Bus\" Wheeler, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff had become dissatisfied with McNamara's leadership and was outraged by that remark. In response to McNamara's claim that the Joint Chiefs supported him, he proposed that the Joint Chiefs all resign in protest at McNamara's leadership.[177] General Harold K. Johnson of the Army, who erroneously blamed McNamara for Johnson's decision not to call up the Reserves in 1965, agreed to Wheeler's plan with his only regret being that he did not resign in 1965.[178] The plan collapsed when General Wallace M. Greene of the Marine Corps refused to go along with it.[178]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nKennedy had emerged as a leading critic of the war by 1967, and Johnson stated to Kearns his belief that McNamara had suffered a nervous breakdown, of which Kennedy, a close friend of McNamara, had taken advantage of.[175] Johnson told Kearns: \"Every day, Bobby [Kennedy] would call up McNamara telling him that the war was terrible and immoral, and that he had to leave\".[175] To soften the blow, Johnson claimed to Kearns that he had talked it over with McNamara and had decided to offer him the presidency of the World Bank, \"the only job he really wanted then\".[175] Johnson had chosen the job of World Bank president for McNamara because its rules prohibited the president from involving himself in the domestic affairs of member nations, which would prevent McNamara from criticizing the war after he left office.[176] Johnson's biggest fear was that if he fired McNamara, then he might join with Kennedy in criticizing him and the war; given his status as the longest-serving Defense Secretary, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn September 29, 1972, a passenger on the ferry to Martha's Vineyard recognized McNamara on board and attempted to throw him into the ocean. McNamara declined to press charges. The man remained anonymous but was interviewed years later by author Paul Hendrickson, who quoted the attacker as saying, \"I just wanted to confront (McNamara) on Vietnam.\"[213]\n\n\n\n### Final years and death[edit]\n\n\nAfter his wife's death, McNamara dated Katharine Graham, with whom he had been friends since the early 1960s.[*citation needed*] Graham died in 2001.\n\n\nIn September 2004, McNamara wed Diana Masieri Byfield, an Italian-born widow who had lived in the United States for more than 40 years. It was her second marriage. She was married to Ernest Byfield, a former OSS officer and Chicago hotel owner, thirty years her senior, whose first wife, Gladys Rosenthal Tartiere, leased her 400-acre (1.6 km²) Glen Ora estate in Middleburg, Virginia, to John F. Kennedy during his presidency.[214][215]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMcNamara took other steps to increase U.S. deterrence posture and military capabilities. He raised the proportion of Strategic Air Command (SAC) strategic bombers on 15-minute ground alert from 25% to 50%, thus lessening their vulnerability to missile attack. In December 1961, he established the United States Strike Command (STRICOM). Authorized to draw forces when needed from the Strategic Army Corps (STRAC), the Tactical Air Command, and the airlift units of the Military Air Transport Service and the military services, Strike Command had the mission \"to respond swiftly and with whatever force necessary to threats against the peace in any part of the world, reinforcing unified commands or... carrying out separate contingency operations.\" McNamara also increased long-range airlift and sealift capabilities and funds for space research and development. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHe witnessed hippie girls placing flowers in the guns of the D.C National Guardsman standing in front of the Pentagon.[179] McNamara described the scene as \"hellish\" as the hippie girls bared their breasts to tempt the Guardsman to \"make love, not war\" while other hippies spat in the faces of the Guardsmen.[179] However, despite seeing the March on the Pentagon demonstrators as a sign of social decay, his characteristic competitive spirit came to the fore as he argued that if he had been leading the March on the Pentagon, he would have taken over the Pentagon and shut it down, saying hippies lacked the necessary discipline and intelligence.[179] On 31 October 1967, McNamara wrote Johnson a memo which he sent the next day saying that the war could not be continued as it \"would be dangerous, costly in lives and unsatisfactory to the American people\".[180] Johnson wrote on the margins on the memo remarks such as \"How do we get this conclusion?\" and \"Why believe this?\"[180]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Kennedy and McNamara with Iran's Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi in April 1962\nThe Draft Presidential Memorandum (DPM)—intended for the White House and usually prepared by the systems analysis office—was a method to study and analyze major defense issues. Sixteen DPMs appeared between 1961 and 1968 on such topics as strategic offensive and defensive forces, NATO strategy and force structure, military assistance, and tactical air forces. OSD sent the DPMs to the services and the Joint Chief of Staff (JCS) for comment; in making decisions, McNamara included in the DPM a statement of alternative approaches, force levels, and other factors. The DPM in its final form became a decision document. The DPM was hated by the JCS and uniformed military in that it cut their ability to communicate directly to the White House.[29] The DPMs were also disliked because the systems analysis process was so heavyweight that it was impossible for any service to effectively challenge its conclusions.[29]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)McNamara pointing to a map of Vietnam at a press conference in April 1965\n![](image)McNamara, South Vietnamese PM Nguyễn Cao Kỳ and President Johnson in Honolulu in February 1966\nDuring President John F.

He returned to Harvard in August 1940 to teach accounting in the Business School and became the institution's highest-paid and youngest assistant professor at that time.[12] Following his involvement there in a program to teach analytical approaches used in business to officers of the United States Army Air Forces, he entered the USAAF as a captain in early 1943, serving most of World War II with its Office of Statistical Control. One of his major responsibilities was the analysis of U.S. bombers' efficiency and effectiveness, especially the B-29 forces commanded by Major General Curtis LeMay in India, China, and the Mariana Islands.[13] McNamara established a statistical control unit for the XX Bomber Command and devised schedules for B-29s doubling as transports for carrying fuel and cargo over The Hump. He left active duty in 1946 with the rank of lieutenant colonel and with a Legion of Merit.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nurging support for a coup while the Pentagon was opposed, Kennedy vacillated and finally being unable to make up his mind, gave the power of decision to Lodge.[72] Lodge, who detested Diệm, gave his approval to the generals plotting against him.[73]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn November 1965, McNamara, who had been a supporter of the war, first started to have doubts about the war, saying at a press conference that \"it will be a long war\", which completely contradicted his previous optimistic statements that the war would be brought to a close soon.[121] Although he was a prime architect of the Vietnam War and repeatedly overruled the JCS on strategic matters, McNamara gradually became skeptical about whether the war could be won by deploying more troops to South Vietnam and intensifying the bombing of North Vietnam, a claim he published in a book years later. He also stated later that his support of the war was given out of loyalty to administration policy. He traveled to South Vietnam many times to study the situation firsthand and became increasingly reluctant to approve the large force increments requested by the military commanders.[124][*not specific enough to verify*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn an interview, McNamara said that the Domino Theory was the main reason for entering the Vietnam War. He also stated, \"Kennedy hadn't said before he died whether, faced with the loss of Vietnam, he would [completely] withdraw; but I believe today that had he faced that choice, he would have withdrawn.\"[147]\n\n\n\n### Equality of opportunity[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\ninitiated by McNamara in 1961 came a decision to increase the nation's \"limited warfare\" capabilities. These moves were significant because McNamara was abandoning President Dwight D. Eisenhower's policy of massive retaliation in favor of a flexible response strategy that relied on increased U.S. capacity to conduct limited, non-nuclear warfare.\n\n\nThe Kennedy administration placed particular emphasis on improving the ability to counter communist \"wars of national liberation\", in which the enemy avoided head-on military confrontation and resorted to political subversion and guerrilla tactics. As McNamara said in his 1962 annual report, \"The military tactics are those of the sniper, the ambush, and the raid. The political tactics are terror, extortion, and assassination.\" In practical terms, this meant training and equipping U.S. military personnel, as well as allies such as South Vietnam, for counterinsurgency operations.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the Kennedy administration, McNamara was closely allied in debates in the cabinet with Dean Rusk, the Secretary of State, with both favoring greater American support for South Vietnam.[45] Initially, the main concern of the new Kennedy administration was Laos, not South Vietnam. In February 1961, McNamara spoke in favor of intervention in Laos, saying that six AT-6 planes owned by the Central Intelligence Agency could be fitted to carry 200-pound bombs in support of General Phoumi Nosavan's forces.[46] Rusk shot down that proposal, saying his World War II experiences in Burma had taught him that bombing was ineffective in the jungles and six planes were not enough.[46] In the spring of 1961 Kennedy seriously considered intervening in Laos where the Communist Pathet Lao, supported by North Vietnam, were winning the civil war.[47] At one point, the Joint Chiefs of Staff advised sending 60,000 U.S. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBesides Stennis, the other members of the Senate Armed Forces Committee were senators Henry M. Jackson, Strom Thurmond and Stuart Symington, all of whom were very hostile to McNamara in their questioning of him.[170] Senator Thurmond reproached McNamara: \"I think it is a statement of placating the Communists. It is a statement of appeasing the Communists. It is a statement of no-win\".[172] Privately, McNamara felt that Thurmond was an \"ass\", saying he was a bigoted, ignorant Southern politician whose only values were a mindless militarism, a fervent belief in white supremacy and a fondness for marrying women far younger than himself. McNamara felt that it was beneath him to be questioned by Thurmond, which explained why he was notably truculent in his answers to him.[172]    \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMcNamara commissioned the Vietnam Study Task Force on June 17, 1967. He was inspired by the confrontation at Harvard the previous November as he had discovered that the students he had been debating knew more about Vietnam's history than he did.[138] The task was assigned to Gelb and six officials whom McNamara instructed to examine just how and why the United States became involved in Vietnam, by answering his list of 100 questions starting with American relations with the Viet Minh in World War II.[139][140] McNamara expected them to be done by September 1967; they finished by January 1969.[140] Though Gelb was a hawk who had written pro-war speeches for the Republican Senator Jacob Javits, he and his team, which grew to 36 members by 1969, became disillusioned as they wrote the history; at one point when discussing what were the lessons of Vietnam, future general Paul F. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Development Concept Paper examined performance, schedule, cost estimates, and technical risks to provide a basis for determining whether to begin or continue a research and development program.[32] But in practice, what it proved to be was a cost burden that became a barrier to entry for companies attempting to deal with the military. It aided the trend toward a few large non-competitive defense contractors serving the military. Rather than serving any useful purpose, the overhead necessary to generate information that was often in practice ignored resulted in increased costs throughout the system.[32]\n\n\nThe Readiness, Information, and Control Tables provided data on specific projects, more detailed than in the FYDP, such as the tables for the Southeast Asia Deployment Plan, which recorded by month and quarter the schedule for deployment, consumption rates, and future projections of U.S. forces in Southeast Asia.\n\n\n\n### Cuban Missile Crisis[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Truman and Eisenhower administrations had committed the United States to support the French and native anti-Communist forces in Vietnam in resisting efforts by the Communists in the North to unify the country, though neither administration established actual combat forces in the war. The U.S. role—initially limited to financial support, military advice and covert intelligence gathering—expanded after 1954 when the French withdrew. During the Kennedy administration, the U.S. military advisory group in South Vietnam steadily increased, with McNamara's concurrence, from 900 to 16,000.[42] U.S. involvement escalated after the Gulf of Tonkin incidents in August 1964, involving two purported attacks on a U.S. Navy destroyer by North Vietnamese naval vessels.[44]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nGorman, one of the historians, went up to the blackboard to write simply, \"Don't.\"[141] The team counted Gelb, Gorman, Melvin Gurtov, Hans Heymann, Richard Moorstein, Daniel Ellsberg, Richard Holbrooke, John Galvin, Paul Warnke and Morton Halperin among its members.[140][142][143]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n38. **^** \"SecDef Histories – Robert McNamara\".

The U.S. nuclear policy remained the same.\n\n\n### Other steps[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAir Force about 700 aircraft shot down over North Vietnam whose total value was about $900 million, making the bombing campaign uneconomical.[134] McNamara's doubts were encouraged by his civilian aides such as Leslie H. Gelb and John McNaughton, who complained that their wives and teenage children were chiding them as \"war criminals\" when they came home from work.[135] McNamara's own teenage son, Robert Craig McNamara, was opposed to the war and denounced his father when he came from work every day.[136] McNamara was shocked to discover that the American flag was hanging upside down in his son's bedroom as the younger McNamara told him that he was ashamed of America because of him.[130] McNaughton told McNamara that after having talked to some of the young people that \"a feeling is widely and strongly held...that 'the Establishment' is out of its mind\" and the dominant opinion was \"that we are trying to impose some U.S. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSenator John C. Stennis was a conservative Southern Democrat who enjoyed much influence as a senior member of the Senate Armed Forces Committee.[167] Stennis saw himself more as a champion of the military rather than its overseer, and as such the military often leaked information to him, in the full knowledge that he would take up their cause on Capitol Hill.[168] Reflecting their unhappiness with McNamara's leadership, in the spring of 1967 senior generals and admirals let Stennis know of their belief that the Defense Secretary was mismanaging the war. This led Stennis to schedule hearings for the Senate Armed Forces Committee in August 1967 to examine the charge that \"unskilled civilian amateurs\" (i.e. McNamara) were not letting \"professional military experts\" win the war. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe casualty lists mounted as the number of troops and the intensity of fighting escalated. McNamara put in place a statistical strategy for victory in Vietnam. He concluded that there were a limited number of VC fighters in South Vietnam and that a war of attrition would destroy them. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHerrick of the *Maddox* reported that the \"torpedo boats\" were almost certainly just radar \"blips\" caused by the \"freak weather effects\" of the storm and the reports of an attack on his ship were due to an \"overeager\" radar operator who mistook the motors of the ship for the rush of torpedoes.[90] Johnson promptly seized upon the reports of an attack on a Navy warship in international waters to ask Congress to pass a resolution giving him the authority to wage war in Vietnam.[90] McNamara, via Admiral U. S.

However, he never believed it was wise for the United States to move in that direction because of psychological risks of relying too much on nuclear weaponry and that there would be pressure from many directions to build a larger system than would be militarily effective.[162]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA safe was installed in McNamara's office at the World Bank to house his papers relating to his time as Defense Secretary, which was a normal courtesy extended to former Defense Secretaries who might face controversy over their actions and wish to defend themselves by quoting from the documentary record.[141] When the Pentagon Papers were finished in April 1969, and a copy of the Papers were brought into McNamara's office, he became angry and said: \"I don't want to see it!

The secretary believed that the United States could afford any amount needed for national security, but that \"this ability does not excuse us from applying strict standards of effectiveness and efficiency to the way we spend our defense dollars.... You have to make a judgment on how much is enough.\"[*citation needed*] Acting on these principles, McNamara instituted a much-publicized cost reduction program, which, he reported, saved $14 billion in the five-year period beginning in 1961. Although he had to withstand a storm of criticism from senators and representatives from affected congressional districts, he closed many military bases and installations that he judged unnecessary for national security. He was equally determined about other cost-saving measures.[38]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n142. **^** \"Paul C.

Kennedy asked McNamara to tape a statement praising his leadership during the Cuban Missile Crisis with the understanding that the statement was meant for a TV ad.[166] McNamara praised Kennedy's \"shrewd diplomacy\", saying he had \"remained calm and cool, firm, but restrained, never nettled and never rattled\".[192] Though this was a violation of World Bank rules, McNamara felt guilty over refusing Kennedy's requests to resign and decline the World Bank presidency.[192] He was attacked for the tape with the *New York Times* in an editorial lambasting him for his \"poor judgement and poorer taste\".[192] For a moment, McNamara feared he would be fired from the World Bank.[192]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn April 1964, Senator Wayne Morse called the war \"McNamara's War\".[83] In response, McNamara told the press that he was honored, saying \"I think it is a very important war, and I am pleased to be identified with it and do whatever I can to win it\".[84] In May 1964, Senator Richard Russell advised Johnson against relying too much on McNamara, saying \"McNamara is the smartest fella any of us know. But he's got too much-he's opinionated as hell-and he's made up his mind\".[84] Russell told Johnson that he should find an expert, preferably a World War II general who was \"not scared to death of McNamara\" to go to South Vietnam to say that the war was unwinnable and that the United States should pull out, advice that Johnson rejected.[83]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nparticularly if these statistics were compared like baseball standings and there were no stringent requirements as to how and by whom the counts were to be made\".[120] The obsession with \"body counts\" led to much exaggeration of the losses inflicted on the enemy as the officers with the highest \"body counts\" were promoted while also fueling a grisly competition between units to achieve the highest \"body counts\" that led to innocent civilians being killed to inflate their daily \"body counts\". It is generally accepted by historians that the vast daily losses that U.S. officers claimed to have inflicted on the VC were fabricated as many officers desperate for a promotion reported \"body counts\" well above what they were actually achieving.[120]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn February 1965, the VC attacked the American airfield at Pleiku, killing 8 Americans and destroying 10 aircraft.[104] After hearing of the attack, Johnson assembled his national security team together with the Speaker of the House of Representatives, John W. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMcCormack, and the Senate Majority Leader, Mike Mansfield, to announce \"I've had enough of this\".[105] Only Mansfield and the Vice President, Hubert Humphrey, objected to Johnson's plans to bomb North Vietnam.[105] Aircraft from the carrier, USS *Ranger*, launched Operation Flaming Dart bombing the North Vietnamese army base at Đồng Hới later that day.[105] McNamara was forced to tell Johnson that the Flaming Dart raids had done little damage owing to the heavy clouds, which caused the pilots to miss when dropping their bombs, and more raids would be needed.[106] On 11 February, Johnson ordered more bombing raids, and 2 March approved Operation Rolling Thunder, a strategic bombing offensive against North Vietnam that was originally planned to last eight weeks, and instead went on for three years.[107] After the bombing raids started, General William Westmoreland of the Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV), \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWhen working at Ford Motor Company, McNamara resided in Ann Arbor, Michigan, rather than the usual auto executive domains of Grosse Pointe, Birmingham, and Bloomfield Hills.

This goddamned bombing campaign, it's worth nothing, it's done nothing, they dropped more bombs than on all of Europe in all of World War II and it hasn't done a fucking thing!\"[188] McNamara then broke down in tears, saying to Johnson to just accept that the war could not be won and stop listening to Rostow.[189] Henry McPherson, an aide to the president, recalled the scene: \"He reeled off the familiar statistics-how we had dropped more bombs on Vietnam than on all of Europe during World War II. Then his voice broke, and there were tears on his eyes as he spoke of the futility, the crushing futility of the air war. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe rest of us sat silently-I for one with my mouth open, listening to the secretary of defense talk that way about a campaign for which he had, ultimately, been responsible.

Rusk was a quiet advisor to Kennedy, rarely making his own views known to other officials. He supported diplomatic efforts during the Cuban Missile Crisis, and, though he initially expressed doubts about the escalation of the U.S. role in the Vietnam War, he became known as one of its strongest supporters. Asked to stay on by President Lyndon Johnson after Kennedy's assassination in 1963, Rusk was known to be a favorite of Johnson's. He left the Secretary role in January 1969, and taught international relations at the University of Georgia School of Law.\n\n\n\n\n## Childhood and education[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Government offices\n |\n| --- |\n| Preceded byDean Acheson\n***as Assistant Secretary of State for Congressional Relations and International Conferences*** |  **Assistant Secretary of State for International Organization Affairs** 1949\n | Succeeded byJohn D.

It now employed 23,000 people including 6,000 Foreign Service officers and had diplomatic relations with 98 countries.[26] He had faith in the use of military action to combat communism. Despite private misgivings about the Bay of Pigs invasion, he remained noncommittal during the executive council meetings leading up to the attack and never opposed it outright. Early in his tenure, he had strong doubts about US intervention in Vietnam,[27] but later his vigorous public defense of US actions in the Vietnam War made him a frequent target of anti-war protests. Just as had under the Truman administration, Rusk tended to favor hawkish line towards Vietnam and frequently allied himself in debates in the Cabinet and on the National Security Council with equally hawkish Defense Secretary Robert McNamara.[28]\n\n\n\n### Vietnam and Laos[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nLowenthal, Max (1948), Dawson, Donald S.

Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson, the second-longest serving Secretary of State after Cordell Hull from the Franklin Roosevelt administration. He had been a high government official in the 1940s and early 1950s, as well as the head of a leading foundation. He is cited as one of the two officers responsible for dividing the two Koreas at the 38th parallel.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nRusk stated during his time as Secretary of State that he never saw any evidence that the Soviet Union planned to invade Western Europe and he \"seriously doubted\" that it ever would.[131] Cohen noted that in contrast to his years with Kennedy, Rusk was warmer and more protective towards Johnson, whom he clearly got on better with than he ever did with Kennedy.[132]\n\n\nIn a review of *As I Saw It*, the historian George C. Herring wrote that the book was mostly dull and uninformative when it came to Rusk's time as Secretary of State, telling little that historians did not already know, and the most interesting and passionate parts concerned his youth in the \"Old South\" and his conflict and reconciliation with his son Richard.[133]\n\n\nRusk died of heart failure in Athens, Georgia, on December 20, 1994, at the age of 85.[134] He and his wife are buried at the Oconee Hill Cemetery in Athens.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n131. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** Cohen, Warren (Spring 1991). \"New Light on Dean Rusk?

Shortly after Kennedy was assassinated, Rusk offered his resignation to the new president, Lyndon B.

On December 1, 1968, citing the halt of bombing in North Vietnam, Rusk said that the Soviet Union would need to come forward and do what it could to forward peace talks in southeast Asia.[121] On December 22, Rusk appeared on television to officially confirm the 82 surviving crew members of the USS *Pueblo* intelligence ship, speaking on behalf of the hospitalized President Johnson.[122]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n> He established only a distant relationship with President Kennedy but worked more closely with President Johnson. Both presidents appreciated his loyalty and his low‐key style. Although an indefatigable worker, Rusk exhibited little talent as a manager of the Department of State.[136]\n> \n> \n\n\nRegarding Vietnam, historians agree that President Johnson relied heavily on the advice of Rusk, Defense Secretary Robert McNamara, and national security adviser McGeorge Bundy to the effect that a communist takeover of all of Vietnam was unacceptable, and the only way to prevent it was to escalate America's commitment. Johnson took their conclusions and rejected dissenting views.[137]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring the 1930s Rusk served in the Army reserves. He was called to active duty in December 1940 as a captain. He served as a staff officer in the China Burma India Theater. During the war, Rusk had authorized an air drop of arms to the Viet Minh guerrillas in Vietnam commanded by his future enemy Ho Chi Minh.[9] At war's end he was a colonel, decorated with the Legion of Merit with Oak Leaf Cluster.[6]\n\n\n\n### State Department 1945–1953[edit]\n\n\nRusk returned to America to work briefly for the War Department in Washington. He joined the Department of State in February 1945, and worked for the office of United Nations Affairs. In the same year, he suggested splitting Korea into spheres of U.S. and of Soviet influence at the 38th parallel north.[12] After Alger Hiss left State in January 1947, Rusk succeeded him (as director of the Office of Special Political Affairs), according to Max Lowenthal.[13]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n87. **^** Schoenbaum, Thomas J.

He stated he would consider adopting it if Rusk gave his approval first.[49] Rusk, who had gone to New York to attend a session of the United Nations, cautiously gave approval out of the impression that Kennedy had approved it first.[49] When it emerged that was not the case, Kennedy assembled his foreign policy team for a stormy meeting at the White House, with several, such as McNamara, Vice President Lyndon Johnson, and CIA director John McCone, all speaking for standing with Diem, while others like the Undersecretary of State George Ball, W. Avrell Harriman and Roger Hilsman argued for deposing Diem. Much to Kennedy's annoyance, Rusk maintained a stony silence, refusing to take a side. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n> By process of elimination, and determined to run foreign policy from the White House, Kennedy came to Dean Rusk, the president of the Rockefeller Foundation. Rusk was an acceptable last choice, with the right credentials and the right backers. A Rhodes scholar, a college professor, a World War II officer, an Assistant Secretary of State for the Far East under Truman, a liberal Georgian sympathetic to integration, and a consistent Stevenson supporter, Rusk offended no one. The foreign policy establishment — Acheson, Lovett, liberals Bowles and Stevenson, and *The New York Times* — all sang his praises.

At the time, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Omar Bradley, called war with China \"the wrong war, at the wrong place, at the wrong time, and with the wrong enemy\".[18] In May 1951, Rusk gave a speech at a dinner sponsored by the China Institute in Washington, which he had not submitted to the State Department in advance, where he implied the United States should unify Korea under Syngman Rhee and should overthrow Mao Zedong in China.[18] Rusk's speech attracted more attention than he expected, as the columnist Walter Lippmann ran a column reading \"Bradley vs. Rusk\", accusing Rusk of advocating a policy of unconditional surrender in the Korean war.[18] For embarrassing Acheson, Rusk was forced to resign and went into the private sector as the director of the Rockefeller Foundation.[18]\n\n\n\n### Rockefeller Foundation[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 1 November 1964, the Viet Cong attacked the American airbase at Bien Hoa, killing 4 Americans.[65] Rusk told Ambassador Taylor that with the elections occurring in less than 48 hours, Johnson did not want to act, but after the election there would be \"a more systematic campaign of military pressure on the North with all implications we have always seen in their course of action\".[66]\n\n\n\n### Nasser[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn April 1965, Senator Robert Kennedy during a visit to the White House advised Johnson to sack Rusk and replace him with Bill Moyers.[72] Johnson at first thought this was a joke, saying that Kennedy's brother had appointed him Secretary of State, and was astonished to learn that Kennedy was serious.

His taciturn qualities, which served him so well in negotiating with the Russians, ill-prepared him for the wrenching, introspective, soul-shattering journey that a true reappraisal of Vietnam policy would have involved. Although trained for high office, he was unprepared for such a journey, for admitting that thousands of American lives, and hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese, might have been lost in vain.\"[132]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAs he recalled in his autobiography, *As I Saw It*, Rusk did not have a good relationship with President Kennedy. The president was often irritated by Rusk's reticence in advisory sessions and felt that the State Department was \"like a bowl of jelly\" and that it \"never comes up with any new ideas\". In 1963, *Newsweek* ran a cover story on the National Security Adviser McGeorge Bundy under the title \"Cool Head for the Cold War\".[51] The author of the story wrote that Rusk \"was not known for his force and decisiveness\" and asserted that Bundy was \"the real Secretary of State\".[51] Special counsel to the president Ted Sorensen believed that Kennedy, being well versed and practiced in foreign affairs, acted as his own secretary of state. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n123. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Langguth, A.J. *Our Vietnam 1954–1975*, 2000 p.533\n124. **^** Langguth, A.J. *Our Vietnam 1954–1975*, 2000 p.533-534\n125. **^** Yuenger, James (January 2, 1969). \"Arab Recognition of Israel Still U.S. Goal, Says Rusk\". *Chicago Tribune*.\n126. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** Langguth, A.J. *Our Vietnam 1954–1975*, New York: Simon and Schuster, 2000 p.534\n127. **^** Jones, William (July 27, 1969). \"Rusk Backs ABM, Hails Peace Work\". *Chicago Tribune*.\n128. **^** Cohen, Warren (Spring 1991). \"New Light on Dean Rusk?

Typically he was highly cautious on most issues, except for Vietnam:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn January 2, 1969, Rusk met with five Jewish American leaders in his office to assure them the US had not changed its policy in the Middle East of recognizing the sovereignty of Israel. One of the leaders, the American-Israeli Public Affairs committee's Irving Kane, said afterward that Rusk had successfully convinced him.[125]\n\n\n\n## Retirement[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThis would have a very serious effect on the country.\"[102] When McNamara advised Johnson in October 1967 to agree to North Vietnam's demand that the United States cease the bombing campaign as the precondition for opening peace talks, Rusk opposed the idea of a \"bombing pause\" as removing the \"incentive for peace\", and urged Johnson to continue Operation Rolling Thunder.[103] By this time, many at the State Department were concerned by Rusk's drinking on the job with William Bundy later saying that Rusk was a like a \"zombie\" until he started to drink.[104] McNamara was shocked when he visited him at Foggy Bottom in the afternoon and saw Rusk open his desk to pull out a bottle of scotch, which he proceeded to drink in its entirety.[102] Unlike the abrasive McNamara, who was widely disliked at the Pentagon, Rusk was sufficiently liked by his colleagues in the State Department that none leaked their concerns about his drinking to the media.[105]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n97. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Romano, Renée Christine (2003). *Race Mixing*.

It may be hard for readers today to understand what went through his mind. But it was very clear to me at the time: he believed that because he was a southerner, working for a southern president, such a marriage – if he did not resign or stop it – would bring down immense criticism on both him and the president. ...

So far as I was aware, the marriage had absolutely no effect – political or personal – on Dean or the president.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRusk was a supporter of the Marshall Plan and of the United Nations.[14] In 1948, he supported the Secretary of State George Marshall in advising Truman against recognizing Israel, fearing it would damage relations with oil-rich Arab states like Saudi Arabia, but was overruled by Truman's legal counsel, Clark Clifford, who persuaded the president to recognize Israel.[14] When Marshall was asked to explain why he did not resign over the recognition of Israel, he replied that the secretary of state did not resign over decisions made by the president who had the ultimate control of foreign policy.[14] Rusk, who admired Marshall, supported his decision and always quoted the remark made by Truman: \"The president makes the foreign policy\".[14] In 1949, he was made deputy Undersecretary of State under Dean Acheson, who had replaced Marshall as secretary of state.\n\n\n\n### Assistant secretary of state for Far Eastern affairs[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWhen Johnson first discussed dropping out of the 1968 election at a National Security Council meeting in September 1967, Rusk was opposed, saying: \"You must not go down.

Kennan and General James Gavin, who were both critical of the Vietnam War.[88] Rusk who served as Johnson's principal spokesman on Vietnam was sent by the president together with General Maxwell Taylor to serve as his rebuttal witnesses before the Foreign Relations Committee. Rusk testified that the war was a morally justified struggle to halt \"the steady extension of Communist power through force and threat\".[88] Historian Stanley Karnow wrote the televised hearings were a compelling \"political theater\" as Fulbright and Rusk verbally dueled about the merits of the Vietnam war with both men pouncing on any weaknesses in the other's argument.[88]\n\n\n\n### 1966 hawks versus doves[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn January 5, 1968, notes by Rusk were delivered to Ambassador of the Soviet Union to the United States Anatoly Dobrynin, pleading support from the US to \"avoid recurrence of\" claimed bombing of Russian cargo ships in the Haiphong North Vietnam port the day prior.[106] On February 9, Rusk was asked by Senator William Fulbright over his possible information in regards to a US tactical nuclear weapons introduction in South Vietnam report.[107]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGeorge Herring wrote about Rusk in 1992: \"He is a man utterly without pretense, a thoroughly decent individual, a man of stern countenance and unbending principles. He is a man with a passion for secrecy. He is a shy and reticent man, who as Secretary of State sipped scotch to loosen his tongue for press conferences. Stolid and normally laconic, he also has a keen, dry wit. He has often been described as the 'perfect number two,' a loyal subordinate who had strong—if unexpressed—reservations about the Bay of Pigs operation, but after its failure could defend it as though he had planned it.\"[138]\n\n\nSummarizing the views of historians and political scientists, Smith Simpson states:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRusk quickly became one of Johnson's favorite advisers, and just before the Democratic National Convention the two had a discussion about Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, who was angling to be Johnson's running mate, much to the president's discomfort.[56] Both Johnson and Rusk agreed that Kennedy was \"freakishly ambitious\" with an obsessive desire to one day be president. Rusk told Johnson: \"Mr. President, I just can't wrap my mind around that kind of ambition. I don't know how to understand it.\"[56]\n\n\n\n### Vietnam in 1964[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn a review of his memoir *As I Saw It*, the American historian Warren Cohen noted that little of the acrimony of Rusk's relations with McNamara, Bundy and Fulbright appeared, but that Rusk was unremittingly hostile in his picture of Kennedy's closest adviser and right-hand man, his younger brother Robert, together with the UN Secretary General U Thant.[131] In *As I Saw It*, Rusk expressed considerable anger at the media's coverage of the Vietnam War, accusing anti-war journalists of \"faking\" stories and images that portrayed the war in an unflattering light.[131] Rusk spoke about what he called the \"so-called freedom of the press\", as he maintained that journalists from *The New York Times* and *The Washington Post* only wrote what their editors told them to write, saying, if there were true freedom of the press, both newspapers would have portrayed the war more positively.[131] Despite his hawkish views towards the Soviet Union, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBy 1966, the Johnson administration had become divided between the \"hawks\" and the \"doves\", through the latter term was somewhat misleading as the \"doves\" within the administration merely favored opening peace talks to end the war as opposed to pulling out U.S. forces from Vietnam.[89] Rusk together with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Earle \"Bus\" Wheeler and the National Security Adviser Walt Whitman Rostow were the leading \"hawks\" while the leading \"doves\" was Rusk's former ally McNamara together with Harriman.[90] Rusk equated withdrawal from Vietnam as \"appeasement\", through at times he was willing to advise Johnson to open peace talks as a way to rebut domestic criticism that Johnson was unwilling to consider alternative ways to end the war.[90]\n\n\n\n### 1967 deescalation[edit]\n\n\nOn April 18, 1967, Rusk said the United States was prepared to \"take steps to deescalate the conflict whenever we are assured that the north will take appropriate corresponding steps\".[91][92]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Thomas J.

Now, I'm the Secretary of State of the United States, and I'm on our side! None of your papers or your broadcasting apparatuses are worth a damn unless the United States succeeds. They are trivial compared to that question. So I don't know why people have to be probing for things that one can bitch about, when there are two thousand stories on the same day about things that are more constructive.\"[108] However, despite his rage at the media who he felt were misrepresenting the war, he admitted to finding signs that public opinion was shifting against the war. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn May 1965, Rusk told Johnson that the \"Four Points\" presented by the North Vietnam premier Dong as peace terms were deceptive because \"the third of those four points required the imposition of the National Liberation Front on all South Vietnam\".[73] In June 1965, when General William Westmoreland requested of Johnson 180, 000 troops to Vietnam, Rusk argued to Johnson that the United States had to fight in Vietnam to maintain \"the integrity of the U.S. commitment\" throughout the world, but also wondered aloud if Westermoreland was exaggerating the extent of the problems in South Vietnam in order to have more troops under his command.[74] However, despite his doubts about Westmoreland Rusk in a rare memo to the president warned that if South Vietnam were lost \"the Communist world would draw conclusions that would lead to our ruin and almost certainly to a catastrophic war\".[75] At another meeting, Rusk stated the United States should have committed itself to Vietnam more heavily in 1961, saying that if U.S. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRusk considered resignation in the summer of 1967, because \"his daughter planned to marry a black classmate at Stanford University, and he could not impose such a political burden on the president\",[96] after it became known that his daughter, Peggy, planned to marry Guy Smith,[97] \"a black Georgetown grad working at NASA\".[98] In response, the *Richmond News Leader* stated that it found the wedding offensive, further saying that \"anything which diminishes [Rusk's] personal acceptability is an affair of state.\"[99] He decided not to resign after talking to McNamara and the president.[100] A year after his daughter's wedding, Rusk was invited to join the faculty of the University of Georgia Law School, only to have his appointment denounced by Roy Harris, an ally of Alabama Governor George Wallace and a member of the university's board of regents, who stated that his opposition was because of Peggy Rusk's interracial marriage. The university nonetheless appointed Rusk to the position.[97]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHe later recalled that during a visit to Cherokee County in February 1968 that people were telling him: \"Dean if you can't tell us when this war is going to end, well then maybe we just ought to chuck it.\"[108] Rusk added \"The fact was that we could not, in any good faith, tell them.\"[108] Shortly afterwards, in March 1968 Rusk appeared as a witness before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee chaired by Fulbright that was examining allegations that the Johnson administration had been dishonest about the Gulf of Tonkin incident in 1964.[109] Fulbright made his sympathies clear by wearing a necktie decorated with doves and olive branches.[110] Through Rusk handled himself well under the relentless questioning by Fulbright, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn April 1961, when a proposal to send 100 more American military advisers to South Vietnam to make a total of 800 appeared before Kennedy, Rusk argued for acceptance even as he noted that it violated the Geneva Accords of 1954 (which the United States had not signed, but promised to abide by), which limited the number of foreign military personnel in Vietnam to 700 at a time.[34] Rusk stated that International Control Commission consisting of diplomats from India, Poland and Canada which was supposed to enforce the Geneva Accords should not be informed of the deployment and the advisers \"be placed in varied locations to avoid attention\".[34] Rusk favored a hawkish line on Laos. Kennedy decided otherwise, on the grounds that Laos had no modern airfields and there was a risk of Chinese intervention.[35] Rusk opened the Geneva conference on neutralizing Laos and predicted to Kennedy that the negotiations would fail.[36]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLike most white Southerners, his family was Democratic; young Rusk's hero was President Woodrow Wilson, the first Southern president since the Civil War era.[3] The experience of poverty made him sympathetic to black Americans. As a 9 year old, Rusk attended a rally in Atlanta where President Wilson called on the United States to join the League of Nations.[3] Rusk grew up on the mythology and legends of the \"Lost Cause\" so common to the South, and he came to embrace the militarism of Southern culture as he wrote in a high school essay that \"young men should prepare themselves for service in case our country ever got into trouble.\"[4] At the age of 12, Rusk had joined the ROTC, whose training duties he took very seriously.[5] Rusk had an intense reverence for the military and throughout his later career, he was inclined to accept the advice of generals.[5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAmerican statesman (1909–1994)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRusk and his family moved to Scarsdale, New York, while he served as a Rockefeller Foundation trustee from 1950 to 1961.[19] In 1952 he succeeded Chester L. Barnard as president of the foundation.[6]\n\n\n\n## Secretary of State[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Foreign policy of the John F. Kennedy administration and Foreign policy of the Lyndon B. Johnson administration\n\n### Selection[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Rusk in his later years.\nJanuary 20, 1969 marked Rusk's last day as Secretary of State, and upon leaving Foggy Bottom he delivered a brief valedictory: \"Eight years ago, Mrs. Rusk and I came quietly. We wish now to leave quietly. Thank you very much\".[126] At a farewell dinner hosted by Dobrynin, the longest-serving ambassador in Washington, Rusk told his host: \"What's done cannot be undone.\"[126] After the dinner, Rusk drove away in a modest car that barely seemed to be working, which Dobrynin considered to an apt symbolic end to the Johnson administration.[126] Upon his return to Georgia, Rusk suffered from a prolonged bout of depression and suffered from psychosomatic illnesses, visiting doctors with complaints of chest and stomach pains that appeared to have no physical basis.[126] Unable to work, Rusk was supported throughout 1969 by the Rockefeller Foundation who paid him a salary as a \"distinguished fellow\".[126]   \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nInstead, he got up in front of those big crowds in Cairo and shouted such things as 'Throw your aid into the Red Sea!'\"[68] On January 5, 1965, Johnson suspended all PL 480 aid to Egypt, an action that immediately plunged the Egyptian economy into a crisis.[69] Nasser realized what he had done and began to lobby for the resumption of PL 480 food sales, but got nowhere.[70] Through Nasser knew the best way of ending the crisis was to pull out of Yemen and seek a rapprochement with Saudi Arabia and the United States, he instead turned towards the Soviet Union to seek support for the rapidly contracting Egyptian economy.[71]\n\n\n\n### Robert Kennedy undercuts Rusk[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\ntroops had been sent to fight then, the present difficulties would not exist.[76]\n\n\nRusk came into conflict with his Undersecretary of State, George Ball, about Vietnam. When Ball argued the governing duumvirate of Thieu and Ky in South Vietnam were \"clowns\" unworthy of American support, Rusk replied: \"Don't give me that stuff. You don't understand that at the time of Korea we had to go out and dig up Syngman Rhee out of the bush where he was hiding. There was no government in Korea, either. We're going to get some breaks, and this thing is going to work.\"[77] Rusk felt that Ball's memos arguing that American involvement in the war should be seen by as few as possible.[78] At meetings of the National Security Council, Rusk consistently argued against Ball.[79]\n\n\n\n### Britain will not send troops[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn June 1964, Rusk met with Hervé Alphand, the French ambassador in Washington, to discuss a French plan for neutralization of both Vietnams, a plan which Rusk was skeptical about.[55] Rusk told Alphand: \"To us, the defense of South Vietnam has the same significance as the defense of Berlin.\"[55] In response, Alphand stated: \"The loss of Berlin would shake the foundations of Western security. On the other hand, if we were to lose South Vietnam, we would not be losing much.\"[55] By contrast, Rusk argued that the Berlin issue and the Vietnam war were all part of the same struggle against the Soviet Union and the United States could not falter anywhere.[55]\n\n\n\n### Distrusting Robert Kennedy[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn December 1965, when McNamara first told Johnson that the \"military action approach is an unacceptable way to a successful conclusion\" and urged him to pause the bombing of North Vietnam, Rusk advised the president that there was only a 1 in 20 chance that a bombing pause would lead to peace talks.[82] However, Rusk argued for the bombing pause, saying \"You must think about the morale of the American people if the other side keeps pushing. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nJohnson ordered the Rolling Thunder bombing raids to resume.[83]\n\n\n\n### France versus NATO[edit]\n\n\nAfter President of France Charles de Gaulle withdrew France from the common NATO military command in February 1966 and ordered all American military forces to leave France, President Johnson asked Rusk to seek further clarification from President de Gaulle by asking whether the bodies of buried American soldiers must leave France as well.[85] Rusk recorded in his autobiography that de Gaulle did not respond when asked, \"Does your order include the bodies of American soldiers in France's cemeteries?\"[86][87]\n\n\n\n### Fulbright hearings on Vietnam[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n137. **^** Schulzinger, Robert D.

He was very outspoken about his views on the attack: “Accordingly, there is every reason to believe that the USS *Liberty* was or should have been identified, or at least her nationality determined, prior to the attack. In these circumstances, the later military attack by Israeli aircraft on the USS *Liberty* is quite literally incomprehensible. As a minimum, the attack must be condemned as an act of military irresponsibility reflecting reckless disregard for human life. The subsequent attack by Israeli torpedo boats, substantially after the vessel was or should have been identified by Israeli military forces, manifests the same reckless disregard for human life. At the time of the attack, the USS *Liberty* was flying the American flag and its identification was clearly indicated in large white letters and numerals on its hull. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWilliam Fulbright, proved too controversial.[20] David Halberstam also described Rusk as \"everybody's number two\".[21] Rusk had recently written an article titled \"The President\" in *Foreign Affairs* calling for the president to direct foreign policy with the secretary of state as a mere adviser, which had Kennedy's interest after it was pointed out to him.[22] After deciding that Fulbright's support for segregation disqualified him, Kennedy summoned Rusk for a meeting, where he himself endorsed Fulbright as the man best qualified to be Secretary of State.[22] Rusk himself was not particularly interested in running the State Department as the annual pay for secretary of state was $25,000 while his job as director of the Rockefeller Foundation paid $60,000 per year.[22] Rusk only agreed to take the position out of a sense of patriotism after Kennedy insisted that he take the job.[23]\n\n\nKennedy biographer Robert Dallek explained Rusk's choice thus:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIt was broad daylight and the weather conditions were excellent. Experience demonstrates that both the flag and the identification number of the vessel were readily visible from the air. At a minimum, the attack must be condemned as an act of military recklessness reflecting wanton disregard for human life. The silhouette and conduct of the USS *Liberty* readily distinguished it from any vessel that could have been considered as hostile. The USS *Liberty* was peacefully engaged, posed no threat whatsoever to the torpedo boats, and obviously carried no armament affording it a combat capability. It could and should have been scrutinized visually at close range before torpedoes were fired.”[37] In 1990 he wrote, “I was never satisfied with the Israeli explanation. Their sustained attack to disable and sink *Liberty* precluded an assault by accident or by some trigger-happy local commander. Through diplomatic channels we refused to accept their explanations. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nJust before the peace talks in Paris were due to open on 13 May 1968, Rusk advocated bombing North Vietnam north of the 20 parallel, a proposal strongly opposed by the Defense Secretary Clark Clifford who stated it would wreck the peace talks.[113] Clifford persuaded a reluctant Johnson to stick by his promise of 31 March 1968 of no bombing north of 20 parallel.[114] Rusk continued his advocacy of bombing north of 20 parallel, telling Johnson on 21 May 1968 \"We will not get a solution in Paris until we prove they can't win in the South\".[115] During a meeting on 26 July 1968, Johnson briefed all three presidential candidates about the state of the war and the peace talks.[116] Rusk who attended the meeting agreed with Richard Nixon's statement that bombing provided leverage in the Paris peace talks, saying: \"If the North Vietnamese were not being bombed, they would have no incentive to do anything\".[116] When Nixon asked \"Where was the war lost?\", Rusk replied: \"In the editorial rooms of this country\".[116]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nRusk argued to Johnson: \"Somehow we must change the pace at which these people move, and I suspect that this can only be done with a pervasive intrusion of Americans into their affairs.\"[63] Increasingly, the feeling in Washington was if South Vietnam could not defeat the Viet Cong guerrillas on its own, the Americans would have to step in and win the war that the South Vietnamese had proved incapable of winning.[63] On September 21, Rusk said the US would not be pushed out of the Gulf of Tonkin and that the prevention of it becoming a \"communist lake\" would be assured by the continued presence of American forces there.[64]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1964 and again in 1965, Rusk approached the British Prime Minister Harold Wilson to ask for British troops to go to Vietnam, requests that were refused. The normally Anglophile Rusk saw the refusal as a \"betrayal\".[80] Rusk told the *Times* of London: \"All we needed was just one regiment. The Black Watch would have done it. Just one regiment, but you wouldn't. Well, don't expect us to save you again. They can invade Sussex and we won't do a damn thing about it.\"[80]\n\n\nShortly before his death, Adlai Stevenson, the American ambassador to the UN, mentioned in an interview with the journalist Eric Severeid the aborted peace terms in Rangoon in 1964, saying the UN Secretary General U Thant was disappointed that Rusk had rejected the terms.[81] When Johnson asked Rusk about the matter, the latter replied that in diplomacy \"there is a difference between rejecting a proposal and not accepting it\", a distinction that Rusk claimed that U Thant had missed.[81]\n\n\n\n### Bombing pause discussed[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n70. **^** Ferris, Jesse *Nasser's Gamble*, Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2013 p.139\n71. **^** Ferris, Jesse *Nasser's Gamble*, Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2013 p.141\n72. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Langguth, A.J. *Our Vietnam 1954–1975*, 2000 p.354\n73. **^** Langguth, A.J. *Our Vietnam 1954–1975*, New York: Simon and Schuster, 2000 p.365\n74. **^** Karnow, Stanley *Vietnam: A History*, New York: Viking, 1983 p.423\n75. **^** Langguth, A.J. *Our Vietnam 1954–1975*, New York: Simon and Schuster, 2000 p.371\n76. **^** Langguth, A.J. *Our Vietnam 1954–1975*, New York: Simon and Schuster, 2000 p.378\n77. **^** Langguth, A.J. *Our Vietnam 1954–1975*, New York: Simon and Schuster, 2000 p.367\n78. **^** Langguth, A.J. *Our Vietnam* New York: Simon and Schuster, 2000 p.369\n79. **^** Langguth, A.J. *Our Vietnam 1954–1975*, New York: Simon and Schuster, 2000 p.353\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn December 12, 1960, Democratic President-elect John F. Kennedy nominated Rusk to be Secretary of State. Rusk was not Kennedy's first choice; his first choice, J. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBorn to a poor farm family in Cherokee County, Georgia, Rusk graduated from Davidson College and was a Rhodes Scholar at the University of Oxford, where he immersed himself in English history and customs. After teaching at Mills College in California, he became an army officer in the war against Japan. He served as a staff officer in the China Burma India Theater, becoming a senior aide to Joseph Stilwell, the top American general. As a civilian he became a senior official in 1945 at the State Department, rising to the number three position under Dean Acheson. He became Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs in 1950. In 1952, Rusk left to become president of the Rockefeller Foundation.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nJust after the Gulf of Tonkin incident, Rusk supported the Gulf of Tonkin resolution.[57] \nOn August 29, 1964, amid the ongoing presidential election, Rusk called for bipartisan support to ensure that the US's foreign policy have both consistency and reliability and said Republican presidential nominee Barry Goldwater was creating \"mischief\".[58] The following month, at a September 10 press conference in the main auditorium of the State Department, Rusk said that Senator Goldwater's critiques \"reflect a basic lack of understanding\" of a U.S. President's handling of conflict and peace.[59]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWhile studying in England as a Rhodes Scholar at St. John's College, Oxford, he received the Cecil Peace Prize in 1933.[6][10] Rusk's experiences of the events of the early 1930s decisively shaped his later views, as he told Karnow in an interview: \n\n\n> I was a senior in college the year that the Japanese seized Manchuria and I have the picture still etched in my mind from the newsreel of the Chinese ambassador standing before the League of Nations, pleading for help against the Japanese attack. I myself was present in the Oxford Union on that night in 1933, when they passed the motion that \"this house will not fight for king and country\" ...  \n> So one cannot have lived through those years and not have some pretty strong feelings ... that it was the failure of the governments of the world to prevent aggression that made the catastrophe of World War II inevitable.[11]\n> \n> \n\n\n### Military in Southeast Asia[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nthe televised hearings were another blow to the prestige of the Johnson administration as it became very apparent to the viewers that a number of senators were now opposed to the war or were only lukewarm in their support.[109] When Fulbright asked Rusk to promise Congress a greater say in the war, Rusk replied that Johnson would consult \"appropriate members of Congress\".[110] When Senator Claiborne Pell asked if the war was worth all the suffering, Rusk charged that he was suffering from \"moral myopia\" about \"the endless struggle for freedom\".[110]\n\n\nOn April 17, during an American Society of Newspaper Editors luncheon meeting, Rusk admitted that the United States has taken \"some lumps\" propaganda wise but the Johnson administration should persist in trying to find a location of neutrality for the peace talks to occur.[111] The following day, Rusk added 10 sites to the 5 proposed initially, accusing Hanoi of having a propaganda battle over neutral areas for discussion during a press conference.[112]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn September 1964, a peace initiative was launched by the UN Secretary General U Thant who tried to set up secret peace talks in his native Burma, which were supported by the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev who pressured Ho Chi Minh to take part in the projected peace talks, saying he would only increase Soviet aid to North Vietnam if the North Vietnamese took part in a diplomatic effort to end the war first.[62] U Thant reported to Rusk that the Soviet pressure seemed to be working as North Vietnam's other arms supplier, China, could not match the hi-tech weaponry that only the Soviet Union could supply.[62] Rusk did not press on this information on Johnson, saying to take part in the planned talks in Burma would have signaled \"the acceptance or the confirmation of aggression\".[62] In October, the peace initiative was ended by Khrushchev being ousted and his successor, Leonid Brezhnev, was not interested in U Thant's plan.[62]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| List of international trips made by secretaries of state of the United States\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nAssistant Secretaries of State for International Organization Affairs\n |\n| --- |\n| * Rusk\n* Hickerson\n* Murphy\n* Key\n* Wilcox\n* Cleveland\n* Sisco\n* De Palma\n* Popper\n* Buffum\n* Lewis\n* Maynes\n* McCall\n* Abrams\n* Newell\n* Keyes\n* Williamson\n* Bolton\n* Bennet\n* Lyman\n* Welch\n* Holmes\n* Silverberg\n* Hook\n* Brimmer\n* Crocker\n* Moley\n* Sison\n | ![](image)\n |\n\n| Authority control databases ![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\n |\n| --- |\n| International | * FAST\n* ISNI\n* VIAF\n* WorldCat\n |\n| National | * France\n* BnF data\n* Germany\n* Italy\n* Israel\n* Belgium\n* United States\n* Sweden\n* Japan\n* Czech Republic\n* Australia\n* Netherlands\n* Poland\n |\n| Academics | * CiNii\n |\n| People | * Deutsche Biographie\n* Trove\n |\n| Other | * NARA\n* SNAC\n* IdRef\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nI didn't believe them then, and I don't believe them to this day. The attack was outrageous.”[38][39]\n\n\nAfter an Israeli claim appeared in *The Washington Post* that they had inquired about the presence of U.S. ships in the area before the attack, Rusk telegrammed the U.S. embassy in Tel Aviv and demanded “urgent confirmation.” U.S. Ambassador to Israel Walworth Barbour confirmed that Israel's story was bogus: “No request for info on U.S. ships operating off Sinai was made until after *Liberty* incident. Had Israelis made such an inquiry it would have been forwarded immediately to the chief of naval operations and other high naval commands and repeated to dept.”[40]\n\n\n\n### Asian affairs[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1950, Rusk was made assistant secretary of state for Far Eastern affairs, at his own request, arguing that he knew Asia the best.[14] He played an influential part in the US decision to become involved in the Korean War, and in Japan's postwar compensation for victorious countries, as shown in the Rusk documents. Rusk was a cautious diplomat and always sought international support. Rusk favored support for Asian nationalist movements, arguing that European imperialism was doomed in Asia, but the Atlanticist Acheson favored closer relations with the European powers, which precluded American support for Asian nationalism.[14] Rusk dutifully declared it was his duty to support Acheson.[14]\n\n\n\n#### French Indochina[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFollowing his retirement, he taught international law at the University of Georgia School of Law in Athens, Georgia (1970–1984). Rusk was emotionally exhausted after 8 years as Secretary of State and narrowly survived a nervous breakdown in 1969.[3] Roy Harris, a university regent who served as the Georgia campaign manager for the presidential campaign of George Wallace in 1968, tried to block Rusk's appointment under the ostensible grounds \"We don't want the university to be a haven for broken-down politicians\", but in reality because he was opposed to a man who had allowed his daughter to marry a black man.[126] However, Harris's vote was overruled. Rusk found that the return to teaching in 1970 and the resumption of the academic career he had abandoned in 1940 was emotionally satisfying. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAgainst the criticism made by Edward Lansdale of the embassy in Saigon, Rusk defended the performance of the State Department, saying South Vietnam was a difficult assignment.[29] On 9 March 1961, the communist Pathet Lao won a notable victory on the Plains of Jars, and for a moment the Pathet Lao seemed on the verge of seizing all of Laos.[30] Rusk expressed considerable disgust when he learned that neither side in the Lao civil war fought very hard, citing a report that both sides had broken off combat to go celebrate a water festival for ten days before resuming their battle.[31] Rusk, who had much experience of Southeast Asia during World War Two, expressed much doubt if bombing alone would stop the Pathet Lao, saying it was his experience that bombing only worked with ground troops to hold the ground or advance.[30]\n\n\n\n### Military plans[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWe must be able to say that all has been done.\"[82] When Johnson announced the bombing pause on Christmas Day 1965, Rusk told the press \"We have put everything into the basket of peace except the surrender of South Vietnam.\"[83] Some of the language that Rusk included in his offer for peace talks seemed to calculate to inspire rejection such as the demand that Hanoi must publicly vow \"to cease aggression\" and the bombing pause was \"a step toward peace, although there has not been the slightest hint or suggestion from the other side as to what they would do if the bombing stopped.\"[81] On December 28, 1965, Rusk sent a cable to Henry Cabot Lodge Jr, the ambassador in Saigon, presenting the bombing pause as merely a cynical exercise in public relations as he wrote: \"The prospect of large-scale reinforcements in men and defense budget increases for the next eighteen-month period requires solid preparation of the American public. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHe immersed himself in English history, politics, and popular culture, making lifelong friends among the British elite.[7] Rusk's rise from poverty made him a passionate believer in the \"American Dream\", and a recurring theme throughout his life was his oft-expressed patriotism, a place in which he believed that anyone, no matter how modest their circumstances, could rise up to live the \"American Dream\".[2]\n\n\nRusk married Virginia Foisie (October 5, 1915 – February 24, 1996) on June 9, 1937.[6] They had three children: David, Richard, and Peggy Rusk.[8]\n\n\nRusk taught at Mills College in Oakland, California, from 1934 to 1949 (except during his military service), and he earned an LL.B. degree at the University of California, Berkeley School of Law in 1940.[9]\n\n\n\n## Career prior to 1961[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn regards to the West New Guinea dispute about the Netherlands New Guinea, Rusk favored supporting the NATO ally Netherlands against Indonesia as he saw Sukarno as pro-Chinese.[42] Rusk accused Indonesia of aggression by attacking the Dutch forces in New Guinea in 1962 and believed that Sukarno had violated the United Nations charter, but was again overruled by Kennedy.[42] In a case of *realpolitik*, Kennedy argued the Dutch had no choice, but to be allied with the United States, meaning they could be taken for granted whereas he was highly concerned that Indonesia, which he called \"the most significant nation in Southeast Asia\", might become communist.[42] To improve relations with Sukarno, Kennedy decided to support the Indonesian claim to Dutch New Guinea; Rusk later wrote he felt \"queasy\" about the way that Kennedy sacrificed the Dutch to win over Indonesia and had strong doubts that the \"consultation\" scheduled to determine the future of the territory in 1969 would be a free and fair one.[42]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nA crucial element will be a clear demonstration that we have explored fully every alternative but the aggressors has left us no choice.\"[83] Rusk ordered Henry A. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the last days of the Johnson administration, the president wanted to nominate Rusk to the Supreme Court.[123] Although Rusk had studied the law, he did not have a law degree nor had he ever practiced law, but Johnson pointed out that the constitution did not require legal experience to serve on the Supreme Court and \"I've already talked to Dick Russell and he said you'd be confirmed easily.\"[123] However, Johnson failed to reckon with Senator James Eastland, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who was also a white supremacist and a supporter of segregation.[124] Through Eastland was a fellow Southerner, he had neither forgotten nor forgiven Rusk for allowing his daughter to marry a black man. Eastland announced he would not confirm Rusk if he were nominated to the Supreme Court.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPresident Nasser of Egypt was regarded as a trouble-maker in Washington owing to Egypt's alliance with the Soviet Union and his plans for a pan-Arab state that would of necessity require overthrowing the governments of every Arab state, most notably American allies such as Saudi Arabia.[43] In the Arab Cold War between Egypt and Saudi Arabia, Rusk favored the latter.[43] However, at the same time, Rusk argued to Kennedy to Nasser was a spoiler who wanted to play off the Soviet Union against the United States to get the best possible bargain for Egypt, and if he leaned in a pro-Soviet direction, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBecause Ho Chi Minh is tied with the Politburo, our policy is to support Bao Dai and the French in Indochina until we have time to help them establish a going concern.\"[17]\n\n\n\n#### Korean War[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nRusk felt that the United States had to support Saudi Arabia against Egypt, but he advised Kennedy against pushing Nasser too hard, saying that it would only drive him closer to the Soviet Union.[43] On October 8, 1962, a \"Food for Peace\" deal was signed with Egypt under the United States committed itself to sell at cost $390 million worth of wheat to Egypt for the next three years.[46] By 1962, Egypt imported 50% of its wheat consumed from the United States and owing to the PL 480 law was some $180 million per year at a time when Egypt's foreign reserves were almost deleted owing to a heavy level of military spending.[47]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Political party | Democratic |\n| Spouse | \nVirginia Foisie\n ​\n(m. 1937)​\n |\n| Children | 3, including Peggy, David and Richard |\n| Education | Davidson College (BA)St John's College, Oxford (BS, MA)University of California, Berkeley (LLB) |\n| Signature | ![](image) |\n| Military service |\n| Allegiance | ![](image) United States |\n| Branch/service | ![](image) United States Army |\n| Rank | ![](image) Colonel |\n| Battles/wars | World War II |\n| Awards | Legion of Merit |\n|  |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNasser had become very dependent upon the PL 480 food sales to provide food at cost to his people, and moreover the Soviet Union could not hope to match America's food sales to Egypt.[45] Nasser argued in exchange for PL 480 food sales that he would not start a war with Israel, saying for that for all his fiery speeches he promised to keep the Arab-Israeli dispute \"in the icebox\".[43] Rusk argued that to Kennedy and later Johnson that they should resist congressional pressure to end the PL 480 food sales to Egypt, stating that ending the PL 480 sales would only push Nasser closer to the Soviet Union and end the leverage that kept the peace between Egypt and Israel.[43] When Nasser sent 70, 000 Egyptian troops into Yemen in September 1962 to support the republican government against the royalist guerrillas supported by Saudi Arabia, Rusk approved of increased arm sales to Saudi Arabia, which were an indirect way of supporting the Yemeni royalists.[43] In common with decision-makers in Washington, \n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_UnG1MrkkHn58yA1UQhnydN3J","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

Rusk was a quiet advisor to Kennedy, rarely making his own views known to other officials. He supported diplomatic efforts during the Cuban Missile Crisis, and, though he initially expressed doubts about the escalation of the U.S. role in the Vietnam War, he became known as one of its strongest supporters. Asked to stay on by President Lyndon Johnson after Kennedy's assassination in 1963, Rusk was known to be a favorite of Johnson's. He left the Secretary role in January 1969, and taught international relations at the University of Georgia School of Law.\n\n\n\n\n## Childhood and education[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Government offices\n |\n| --- |\n| Preceded byDean Acheson\n***as Assistant Secretary of State for Congressional Relations and International Conferences*** |  **Assistant Secretary of State for International Organization Affairs** 1949\n | Succeeded byJohn D.

It now employed 23,000 people including 6,000 Foreign Service officers and had diplomatic relations with 98 countries.[26] He had faith in the use of military action to combat communism. Despite private misgivings about the Bay of Pigs invasion, he remained noncommittal during the executive council meetings leading up to the attack and never opposed it outright. Early in his tenure, he had strong doubts about US intervention in Vietnam,[27] but later his vigorous public defense of US actions in the Vietnam War made him a frequent target of anti-war protests. Just as had under the Truman administration, Rusk tended to favor hawkish line towards Vietnam and frequently allied himself in debates in the Cabinet and on the National Security Council with equally hawkish Defense Secretary Robert McNamara.[28]\n\n\n\n### Vietnam and Laos[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nLowenthal, Max (1948), Dawson, Donald S.

He had been a high government official in the 1940s and early 1950s, as well as the head of a leading foundation.

Herring wrote that the book was mostly dull and uninformative when it came to Rusk's time as Secretary of State, telling little that historians did not already know, and the most interesting and passionate parts concerned his youth in the \"Old South\" and his conflict and reconciliation with his son Richard.[133]\n\n\nRusk died of heart failure in Athens, Georgia, on December 20, 1994, at the age of 85.[134] He and his wife are buried at the Oconee Hill Cemetery in Athens.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n131. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** Cohen, Warren (Spring 1991). \"New Light on Dean Rusk?

Shortly after Kennedy was assassinated, Rusk offered his resignation to the new president, Lyndon B. Johnson.[54] However, Johnson liked Rusk and refused his resignation, He remained secretary throughout Johnson's administration.[54]\n\n\n\n### Defending South Vietnam[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Dean Rusk\n |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)Rusk c. 1960s\n |\n|  |\n| 54th United States Secretary of State |\n| **In office**January 21, 1961 – January 20, 1969 |\n| President | John F.

On December 1, 1968, citing the halt of bombing in North Vietnam, Rusk said that the Soviet Union would need to come forward and do what it could to forward peace talks in southeast Asia.[121] On December 22, Rusk appeared on television to officially confirm the 82 surviving crew members of the USS *Pueblo* intelligence ship, speaking on behalf of the hospitalized President Johnson.[122]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n> He established only a distant relationship with President Kennedy but worked more closely with President Johnson. Both presidents appreciated his loyalty and his low‐key style. Although an indefatigable worker, Rusk exhibited little talent as a manager of the Department of State.[136]\n> \n> \n\n\nRegarding Vietnam, historians agree that President Johnson relied heavily on the advice of Rusk, Defense Secretary Robert McNamara, and national security adviser McGeorge Bundy to the effect that a communist takeover of all of Vietnam was unacceptable, and the only way to prevent it was to escalate America's commitment. Johnson took their conclusions and rejected dissenting views.[137]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring the 1930s Rusk served in the Army reserves. He was called to active duty in December 1940 as a captain. He served as a staff officer in the China Burma India Theater. During the war, Rusk had authorized an air drop of arms to the Viet Minh guerrillas in Vietnam commanded by his future enemy Ho Chi Minh.[9] At war's end he was a colonel, decorated with the Legion of Merit with Oak Leaf Cluster.[6]\n\n\n\n### State Department 1945–1953[edit]\n\n\nRusk returned to America to work briefly for the War Department in Washington. He joined the Department of State in February 1945, and worked for the office of United Nations Affairs. In the same year, he suggested splitting Korea into spheres of U.S. and of Soviet influence at the 38th parallel north.[12] After Alger Hiss left State in January 1947, Rusk succeeded him (as director of the Office of Special Political Affairs), according to Max Lowenthal.[13]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n87. **^** Schoenbaum, Thomas J.

He stated he would consider adopting it if Rusk gave his approval first.[49] Rusk, who had gone to New York to attend a session of the United Nations, cautiously gave approval out of the impression that Kennedy had approved it first.[49] When it emerged that was not the case, Kennedy assembled his foreign policy team for a stormy meeting at the White House, with several, such as McNamara, Vice President Lyndon Johnson, and CIA director John McCone, all speaking for standing with Diem, while others like the Undersecretary of State George Ball, W. Avrell Harriman and Roger Hilsman argued for deposing Diem. Much to Kennedy's annoyance, Rusk maintained a stony silence, refusing to take a side. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n> By process of elimination, and determined to run foreign policy from the White House, Kennedy came to Dean Rusk, the president of the Rockefeller Foundation. Rusk was an acceptable last choice, with the right credentials and the right backers. A Rhodes scholar, a college professor, a World War II officer, an Assistant Secretary of State for the Far East under Truman, a liberal Georgian sympathetic to integration, and a consistent Stevenson supporter, Rusk offended no one. The foreign policy establishment — Acheson, Lovett, liberals Bowles and Stevenson, and *The New York Times* — all sang his praises. But most of all, it was clear to Kennedy from their one meeting in December 1960 that Rusk would be a sort of faceless, faithful bureaucrat who would serve rather than attempt to lead.[24]\n> \n> \n\n\nKennedy tended to address Rusk as \"Mr. Rusk\" instead of Dean.[25]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* \"A conversation with Dean Rusk, former U.S. Secretary of State (1961–1969)\" Part of the American Diplomacy and The Lessons of Crisis: Vietnam and the Cold War collections online at Duke University\n* Dean Rusk Oral History Collection, from the Richard B.

At the time, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Omar Bradley, called war with China \"the wrong war, at the wrong place, at the wrong time, and with the wrong enemy\".[18] In May 1951, Rusk gave a speech at a dinner sponsored by the China Institute in Washington, which he had not submitted to the State Department in advance, where he implied the United States should unify Korea under Syngman Rhee and should overthrow Mao Zedong in China.[18] Rusk's speech attracted more attention than he expected, as the columnist Walter Lippmann ran a column reading \"Bradley vs. Rusk\", accusing Rusk of advocating a policy of unconditional surrender in the Korean war.[18] For embarrassing Acheson, Rusk was forced to resign and went into the private sector as the director of the Rockefeller Foundation.[18]\n\n\n\n### Rockefeller Foundation[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 1 November 1964, the Viet Cong attacked the American airbase at Bien Hoa, killing 4 Americans.[65] Rusk told Ambassador Taylor that with the elections occurring in less than 48 hours, Johnson did not want to act, but after the election there would be \"a more systematic campaign of military pressure on the North with all implications we have always seen in their course of action\".[66]\n\n\n\n### Nasser[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn April 1965, Senator Robert Kennedy during a visit to the White House advised Johnson to sack Rusk and replace him with Bill Moyers.[72] Johnson at first thought this was a joke, saying that Kennedy's brother had appointed him Secretary of State, and was astonished to learn that Kennedy was serious.

His taciturn qualities, which served him so well in negotiating with the Russians, ill-prepared him for the wrenching, introspective, soul-shattering journey that a true reappraisal of Vietnam policy would have involved. Although trained for high office, he was unprepared for such a journey, for admitting that thousands of American lives, and hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese, might have been lost in vain.\"[132]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAs he recalled in his autobiography, *As I Saw It*, Rusk did not have a good relationship with President Kennedy. The president was often irritated by Rusk's reticence in advisory sessions and felt that the State Department was \"like a bowl of jelly\" and that it \"never comes up with any new ideas\". In 1963, *Newsweek* ran a cover story on the National Security Adviser McGeorge Bundy under the title \"Cool Head for the Cold War\".[51] The author of the story wrote that Rusk \"was not known for his force and decisiveness\" and asserted that Bundy was \"the real Secretary of State\".[51] Special counsel to the president Ted Sorensen believed that Kennedy, being well versed and practiced in foreign affairs, acted as his own secretary of state. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n123. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Langguth, A.J. *Our Vietnam 1954–1975*, 2000 p.533\n124. **^** Langguth, A.J. *Our Vietnam 1954–1975*, 2000 p.533-534\n125. **^** Yuenger, James (January 2, 1969). \"Arab Recognition of Israel Still U.S. Goal, Says Rusk\". *Chicago Tribune*.\n126. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** Langguth, A.J. *Our Vietnam 1954–1975*, New York: Simon and Schuster, 2000 p.534\n127. **^** Jones, William (July 27, 1969). \"Rusk Backs ABM, Hails Peace Work\". *Chicago Tribune*.\n128. **^** Cohen, Warren (Spring 1991). \"New Light on Dean Rusk?

The Dean Rusk International Studies Program at Davidson College is also named in his honor.\n\n\nDean Rusk Middle School, located in Canton, Georgia, was named in his honor, as was Dean Rusk Hall on the campus of the University of Georgia.\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\nThe consensus of historians is that Rusk was a very intelligent man, but very shy and so deeply immersed in details and the complexities of each case that he was reluctant to make a decision and unable to clearly explain to the media what the government's policies were.[135] Jonathan Coleman says that he was deeply involved in the Berlin Crisis, the Cuban Missile Crisis, NATO, and the Vietnam War. Typically he was highly cautious on most issues, except for Vietnam:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn January 2, 1969, Rusk met with five Jewish American leaders in his office to assure them the US had not changed its policy in the Middle East of recognizing the sovereignty of Israel. One of the leaders, the American-Israeli Public Affairs committee's Irving Kane, said afterward that Rusk had successfully convinced him.[125]\n\n\n\n## Retirement[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThis would have a very serious effect on the country.\"[102] When McNamara advised Johnson in October 1967 to agree to North Vietnam's demand that the United States cease the bombing campaign as the precondition for opening peace talks, Rusk opposed the idea of a \"bombing pause\" as removing the \"incentive for peace\", and urged Johnson to continue Operation Rolling Thunder.[103] By this time, many at the State Department were concerned by Rusk's drinking on the job with William Bundy later saying that Rusk was a like a \"zombie\" until he started to drink.[104] McNamara was shocked when he visited him at Foggy Bottom in the afternoon and saw Rusk open his desk to pull out a bottle of scotch, which he proceeded to drink in its entirety.[102] Unlike the abrasive McNamara, who was widely disliked at the Pentagon, Rusk was sufficiently liked by his colleagues in the State Department that none leaked their concerns about his drinking to the media.[105]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n97. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Romano, Renée Christine (2003). *Race Mixing*.

It may be hard for readers today to understand what went through his mind. But it was very clear to me at the time: he believed that because he was a southerner, working for a southern president, such a marriage – if he did not resign or stop it – would bring down immense criticism on both him and the president. ...

Kennan and General James Gavin, who were both critical of the Vietnam War.[88] Rusk who served as Johnson's principal spokesman on Vietnam was sent by the president together with General Maxwell Taylor to serve as his rebuttal witnesses before the Foreign Relations Committee. Rusk testified that the war was a morally justified struggle to halt \"the steady extension of Communist power through force and threat\".[88] Historian Stanley Karnow wrote the televised hearings were a compelling \"political theater\" as Fulbright and Rusk verbally dueled about the merits of the Vietnam war with both men pouncing on any weaknesses in the other's argument.[88]\n\n\n\n### 1966 hawks versus doves[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn January 5, 1968, notes by Rusk were delivered to Ambassador of the Soviet Union to the United States Anatoly Dobrynin, pleading support from the US to \"avoid recurrence of\" claimed bombing of Russian cargo ships in the Haiphong North Vietnam port the day prior.[106] On February 9, Rusk was asked by Senator William Fulbright over his possible information in regards to a US tactical nuclear weapons introduction in South Vietnam report.[107]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGeorge Herring wrote about Rusk in 1992: \"He is a man utterly without pretense, a thoroughly decent individual, a man of stern countenance and unbending principles. He is a man with a passion for secrecy. He is a shy and reticent man, who as Secretary of State sipped scotch to loosen his tongue for press conferences. Stolid and normally laconic, he also has a keen, dry wit. He has often been described as the 'perfect number two,' a loyal subordinate who had strong—if unexpressed—reservations about the Bay of Pigs operation, but after its failure could defend it as though he had planned it.\"[138]\n\n\nSummarizing the views of historians and political scientists, Smith Simpson states:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRusk quickly became one of Johnson's favorite advisers, and just before the Democratic National Convention the two had a discussion about Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, who was angling to be Johnson's running mate, much to the president's discomfort.[56] Both Johnson and Rusk agreed that Kennedy was \"freakishly ambitious\" with an obsessive desire to one day be president. Rusk told Johnson: \"Mr. President, I just can't wrap my mind around that kind of ambition. I don't know how to understand it.\"[56]\n\n\n\n### Vietnam in 1964[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn a review of his memoir *As I Saw It*, the American historian Warren Cohen noted that little of the acrimony of Rusk's relations with McNamara, Bundy and Fulbright appeared, but that Rusk was unremittingly hostile in his picture of Kennedy's closest adviser and right-hand man, his younger brother Robert, together with the UN Secretary General U Thant.[131] In *As I Saw It*, Rusk expressed considerable anger at the media's coverage of the Vietnam War, accusing anti-war journalists of \"faking\" stories and images that portrayed the war in an unflattering light.[131] Rusk spoke about what he called the \"so-called freedom of the press\", as he maintained that journalists from *The New York Times* and *The Washington Post* only wrote what their editors told them to write, saying, if there were true freedom of the press, both newspapers would have portrayed the war more positively.[131] Despite his hawkish views towards the Soviet Union, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBy 1966, the Johnson administration had become divided between the \"hawks\" and the \"doves\", through the latter term was somewhat misleading as the \"doves\" within the administration merely favored opening peace talks to end the war as opposed to pulling out U.S. forces from Vietnam.[89] Rusk together with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Earle \"Bus\" Wheeler and the National Security Adviser Walt Whitman Rostow were the leading \"hawks\" while the leading \"doves\" was Rusk's former ally McNamara together with Harriman.[90] Rusk equated withdrawal from Vietnam as \"appeasement\", through at times he was willing to advise Johnson to open peace talks as a way to rebut domestic criticism that Johnson was unwilling to consider alternative ways to end the war.[90]\n\n\n\n### 1967 deescalation[edit]\n\n\nOn April 18, 1967, Rusk said the United States was prepared to \"take steps to deescalate the conflict whenever we are assured that the north will take appropriate corresponding steps\".[91][92]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Thomas J.

Now, I'm the Secretary of State of the United States, and I'm on our side! None of your papers or your broadcasting apparatuses are worth a damn unless the United States succeeds. They are trivial compared to that question. So I don't know why people have to be probing for things that one can bitch about, when there are two thousand stories on the same day about things that are more constructive.\"[108] However, despite his rage at the media who he felt were misrepresenting the war, he admitted to finding signs that public opinion was shifting against the war. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn May 1965, Rusk told Johnson that the \"Four Points\" presented by the North Vietnam premier Dong as peace terms were deceptive because \"the third of those four points required the imposition of the National Liberation Front on all South Vietnam\".[73] In June 1965, when General William Westmoreland requested of Johnson 180, 000 troops to Vietnam, Rusk argued to Johnson that the United States had to fight in Vietnam to maintain \"the integrity of the U.S. commitment\" throughout the world, but also wondered aloud if Westermoreland was exaggerating the extent of the problems in South Vietnam in order to have more troops under his command.[74] However, despite his doubts about Westmoreland Rusk in a rare memo to the president warned that if South Vietnam were lost \"the Communist world would draw conclusions that would lead to our ruin and almost certainly to a catastrophic war\".[75] At another meeting, Rusk stated the United States should have committed itself to Vietnam more heavily in 1961, saying that if U.S. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRusk considered resignation in the summer of 1967, because \"his daughter planned to marry a black classmate at Stanford University, and he could not impose such a political burden on the president\",[96] after it became known that his daughter, Peggy, planned to marry Guy Smith,[97] \"a black Georgetown grad working at NASA\".[98] In response, the *Richmond News Leader* stated that it found the wedding offensive, further saying that \"anything which diminishes [Rusk's] personal acceptability is an affair of state.\"[99] He decided not to resign after talking to McNamara and the president.[100] A year after his daughter's wedding, Rusk was invited to join the faculty of the University of Georgia Law School, only to have his appointment denounced by Roy Harris, an ally of Alabama Governor George Wallace and a member of the university's board of regents, who stated that his opposition was because of Peggy Rusk's interracial marriage. The university nonetheless appointed Rusk to the position.[97]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHe later recalled that during a visit to Cherokee County in February 1968 that people were telling him: \"Dean if you can't tell us when this war is going to end, well then maybe we just ought to chuck it.\"[108] Rusk added \"The fact was that we could not, in any good faith, tell them.\"[108] Shortly afterwards, in March 1968 Rusk appeared as a witness before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee chaired by Fulbright that was examining allegations that the Johnson administration had been dishonest about the Gulf of Tonkin incident in 1964.[109] Fulbright made his sympathies clear by wearing a necktie decorated with doves and olive branches.[110] Through Rusk handled himself well under the relentless questioning by Fulbright, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn April 1961, when a proposal to send 100 more American military advisers to South Vietnam to make a total of 800 appeared before Kennedy, Rusk argued for acceptance even as he noted that it violated the Geneva Accords of 1954 (which the United States had not signed, but promised to abide by), which limited the number of foreign military personnel in Vietnam to 700 at a time.[34] Rusk stated that International Control Commission consisting of diplomats from India, Poland and Canada which was supposed to enforce the Geneva Accords should not be informed of the deployment and the advisers \"be placed in varied locations to avoid attention\".[34] Rusk favored a hawkish line on Laos. Kennedy decided otherwise, on the grounds that Laos had no modern airfields and there was a risk of Chinese intervention.[35] Rusk opened the Geneva conference on neutralizing Laos and predicted to Kennedy that the negotiations would fail.[36]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLike most white Southerners, his family was Democratic; young Rusk's hero was President Woodrow Wilson, the first Southern president since the Civil War era.[3] The experience of poverty made him sympathetic to black Americans. As a 9 year old, Rusk attended a rally in Atlanta where President Wilson called on the United States to join the League of Nations.[3] Rusk grew up on the mythology and legends of the \"Lost Cause\" so common to the South, and he came to embrace the militarism of Southern culture as he wrote in a high school essay that \"young men should prepare themselves for service in case our country ever got into trouble.\"[4] At the age of 12, Rusk had joined the ROTC, whose training duties he took very seriously.[5] Rusk had an intense reverence for the military and throughout his later career, he was inclined to accept the advice of generals.[5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAmerican statesman (1909–1994)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRusk and his family moved to Scarsdale, New York, while he served as a Rockefeller Foundation trustee from 1950 to 1961.[19] In 1952 he succeeded Chester L. Barnard as president of the foundation.[6]\n\n\n\n## Secretary of State[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Foreign policy of the John F. Kennedy administration and Foreign policy of the Lyndon B. Johnson administration\n\n### Selection[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Rusk in his later years.\nJanuary 20, 1969 marked Rusk's last day as Secretary of State, and upon leaving Foggy Bottom he delivered a brief valedictory: \"Eight years ago, Mrs. Rusk and I came quietly. We wish now to leave quietly. Thank you very much\".[126] At a farewell dinner hosted by Dobrynin, the longest-serving ambassador in Washington, Rusk told his host: \"What's done cannot be undone.\"[126] After the dinner, Rusk drove away in a modest car that barely seemed to be working, which Dobrynin considered to an apt symbolic end to the Johnson administration.[126] Upon his return to Georgia, Rusk suffered from a prolonged bout of depression and suffered from psychosomatic illnesses, visiting doctors with complaints of chest and stomach pains that appeared to have no physical basis.[126] Unable to work, Rusk was supported throughout 1969 by the Rockefeller Foundation who paid him a salary as a \"distinguished fellow\".[126]   \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nInstead, he got up in front of those big crowds in Cairo and shouted such things as 'Throw your aid into the Red Sea!'\"[68] On January 5, 1965, Johnson suspended all PL 480 aid to Egypt, an action that immediately plunged the Egyptian economy into a crisis.[69] Nasser realized what he had done and began to lobby for the resumption of PL 480 food sales, but got nowhere.[70] Through Nasser knew the best way of ending the crisis was to pull out of Yemen and seek a rapprochement with Saudi Arabia and the United States, he instead turned towards the Soviet Union to seek support for the rapidly contracting Egyptian economy.[71]\n\n\n\n### Robert Kennedy undercuts Rusk[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\ntroops had been sent to fight then, the present difficulties would not exist.[76]\n\n\nRusk came into conflict with his Undersecretary of State, George Ball, about Vietnam. When Ball argued the governing duumvirate of Thieu and Ky in South Vietnam were \"clowns\" unworthy of American support, Rusk replied: \"Don't give me that stuff. You don't understand that at the time of Korea we had to go out and dig up Syngman Rhee out of the bush where he was hiding. There was no government in Korea, either. We're going to get some breaks, and this thing is going to work.\"[77] Rusk felt that Ball's memos arguing that American involvement in the war should be seen by as few as possible.[78] At meetings of the National Security Council, Rusk consistently argued against Ball.[79]\n\n\n\n### Britain will not send troops[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn June 1964, Rusk met with Hervé Alphand, the French ambassador in Washington, to discuss a French plan for neutralization of both Vietnams, a plan which Rusk was skeptical about.[55] Rusk told Alphand: \"To us, the defense of South Vietnam has the same significance as the defense of Berlin.\"[55] In response, Alphand stated: \"The loss of Berlin would shake the foundations of Western security. On the other hand, if we were to lose South Vietnam, we would not be losing much.\"[55] By contrast, Rusk argued that the Berlin issue and the Vietnam war were all part of the same struggle against the Soviet Union and the United States could not falter anywhere.[55]\n\n\n\n### Distrusting Robert Kennedy[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn December 1965, when McNamara first told Johnson that the \"military action approach is an unacceptable way to a successful conclusion\" and urged him to pause the bombing of North Vietnam, Rusk advised the president that there was only a 1 in 20 chance that a bombing pause would lead to peace talks.[82] However, Rusk argued for the bombing pause, saying \"You must think about the morale of the American people if the other side keeps pushing. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nJohnson ordered the Rolling Thunder bombing raids to resume.[83]\n\n\n\n### France versus NATO[edit]\n\n\nAfter President of France Charles de Gaulle withdrew France from the common NATO military command in February 1966 and ordered all American military forces to leave France, President Johnson asked Rusk to seek further clarification from President de Gaulle by asking whether the bodies of buried American soldiers must leave France as well.[85] Rusk recorded in his autobiography that de Gaulle did not respond when asked, \"Does your order include the bodies of American soldiers in France's cemeteries?\"[86][87]\n\n\n\n### Fulbright hearings on Vietnam[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n137. **^** Schulzinger, Robert D.

He was very outspoken about his views on the attack: “Accordingly, there is every reason to believe that the USS *Liberty* was or should have been identified, or at least her nationality determined, prior to the attack. In these circumstances, the later military attack by Israeli aircraft on the USS *Liberty* is quite literally incomprehensible. As a minimum, the attack must be condemned as an act of military irresponsibility reflecting reckless disregard for human life. The subsequent attack by Israeli torpedo boats, substantially after the vessel was or should have been identified by Israeli military forces, manifests the same reckless disregard for human life. At the time of the attack, the USS *Liberty* was flying the American flag and its identification was clearly indicated in large white letters and numerals on its hull. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWilliam Fulbright, proved too controversial.[20] David Halberstam also described Rusk as \"everybody's number two\".[21] Rusk had recently written an article titled \"The President\" in *Foreign Affairs* calling for the president to direct foreign policy with the secretary of state as a mere adviser, which had Kennedy's interest after it was pointed out to him.[22] After deciding that Fulbright's support for segregation disqualified him, Kennedy summoned Rusk for a meeting, where he himself endorsed Fulbright as the man best qualified to be Secretary of State.[22] Rusk himself was not particularly interested in running the State Department as the annual pay for secretary of state was $25,000 while his job as director of the Rockefeller Foundation paid $60,000 per year.[22] Rusk only agreed to take the position out of a sense of patriotism after Kennedy insisted that he take the job.[23]\n\n\nKennedy biographer Robert Dallek explained Rusk's choice thus:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIt was broad daylight and the weather conditions were excellent. Experience demonstrates that both the flag and the identification number of the vessel were readily visible from the air. At a minimum, the attack must be condemned as an act of military recklessness reflecting wanton disregard for human life. The silhouette and conduct of the USS *Liberty* readily distinguished it from any vessel that could have been considered as hostile. The USS *Liberty* was peacefully engaged, posed no threat whatsoever to the torpedo boats, and obviously carried no armament affording it a combat capability. It could and should have been scrutinized visually at close range before torpedoes were fired.”[37] In 1990 he wrote, “I was never satisfied with the Israeli explanation. Their sustained attack to disable and sink *Liberty* precluded an assault by accident or by some trigger-happy local commander. Through diplomatic channels we refused to accept their explanations. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nJust before the peace talks in Paris were due to open on 13 May 1968, Rusk advocated bombing North Vietnam north of the 20 parallel, a proposal strongly opposed by the Defense Secretary Clark Clifford who stated it would wreck the peace talks.[113] Clifford persuaded a reluctant Johnson to stick by his promise of 31 March 1968 of no bombing north of 20 parallel.[114] Rusk continued his advocacy of bombing north of 20 parallel, telling Johnson on 21 May 1968 \"We will not get a solution in Paris until we prove they can't win in the South\".[115] During a meeting on 26 July 1968, Johnson briefed all three presidential candidates about the state of the war and the peace talks.[116] Rusk who attended the meeting agreed with Richard Nixon's statement that bombing provided leverage in the Paris peace talks, saying: \"If the North Vietnamese were not being bombed, they would have no incentive to do anything\".[116] When Nixon asked \"Where was the war lost?\", Rusk replied: \"In the editorial rooms of this country\".[116]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nRusk argued to Johnson: \"Somehow we must change the pace at which these people move, and I suspect that this can only be done with a pervasive intrusion of Americans into their affairs.\"[63] Increasingly, the feeling in Washington was if South Vietnam could not defeat the Viet Cong guerrillas on its own, the Americans would have to step in and win the war that the South Vietnamese had proved incapable of winning.[63] On September 21, Rusk said the US would not be pushed out of the Gulf of Tonkin and that the prevention of it becoming a \"communist lake\" would be assured by the continued presence of American forces there.[64]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1964 and again in 1965, Rusk approached the British Prime Minister Harold Wilson to ask for British troops to go to Vietnam, requests that were refused. The normally Anglophile Rusk saw the refusal as a \"betrayal\".[80] Rusk told the *Times* of London: \"All we needed was just one regiment. The Black Watch would have done it. Just one regiment, but you wouldn't. Well, don't expect us to save you again. They can invade Sussex and we won't do a damn thing about it.\"[80]\n\n\nShortly before his death, Adlai Stevenson, the American ambassador to the UN, mentioned in an interview with the journalist Eric Severeid the aborted peace terms in Rangoon in 1964, saying the UN Secretary General U Thant was disappointed that Rusk had rejected the terms.[81] When Johnson asked Rusk about the matter, the latter replied that in diplomacy \"there is a difference between rejecting a proposal and not accepting it\", a distinction that Rusk claimed that U Thant had missed.[81]\n\n\n\n### Bombing pause discussed[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n70. **^** Ferris, Jesse *Nasser's Gamble*, Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2013 p.139\n71. **^** Ferris, Jesse *Nasser's Gamble*, Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2013 p.141\n72. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Langguth, A.J. *Our Vietnam 1954–1975*, 2000 p.354\n73. **^** Langguth, A.J. *Our Vietnam 1954–1975*, New York: Simon and Schuster, 2000 p.365\n74. **^** Karnow, Stanley *Vietnam: A History*, New York: Viking, 1983 p.423\n75. **^** Langguth, A.J. *Our Vietnam 1954–1975*, New York: Simon and Schuster, 2000 p.371\n76. **^** Langguth, A.J. *Our Vietnam 1954–1975*, New York: Simon and Schuster, 2000 p.378\n77. **^** Langguth, A.J. *Our Vietnam 1954–1975*, New York: Simon and Schuster, 2000 p.367\n78. **^** Langguth, A.J. *Our Vietnam* New York: Simon and Schuster, 2000 p.369\n79. **^** Langguth, A.J. *Our Vietnam 1954–1975*, New York: Simon and Schuster, 2000 p.353\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn December 12, 1960, Democratic President-elect John F.

After teaching at Mills College in California, he became an army officer in the war against Japan. He served as a staff officer in the China Burma India Theater, becoming a senior aide to Joseph Stilwell, the top American general. As a civilian he became a senior official in 1945 at the State Department, rising to the number three position under Dean Acheson. He became Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs in 1950. In 1952, Rusk left to become president of the Rockefeller Foundation.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nJust after the Gulf of Tonkin incident, Rusk supported the Gulf of Tonkin resolution.[57] \nOn August 29, 1964, amid the ongoing presidential election, Rusk called for bipartisan support to ensure that the US's foreign policy have both consistency and reliability and said Republican presidential nominee Barry Goldwater was creating \"mischief\".[58] The following month, at a September 10 press conference in the main auditorium of the State Department, Rusk said that Senator Goldwater's critiques \"reflect a basic lack of understanding\" of a U.S. President's handling of conflict and peace.[59]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWhile studying in England as a Rhodes Scholar at St. John's College, Oxford, he received the Cecil Peace Prize in 1933.[6][10] Rusk's experiences of the events of the early 1930s decisively shaped his later views, as he told Karnow in an interview: \n\n\n> I was a senior in college the year that the Japanese seized Manchuria and I have the picture still etched in my mind from the newsreel of the Chinese ambassador standing before the League of Nations, pleading for help against the Japanese attack. I myself was present in the Oxford Union on that night in 1933, when they passed the motion that \"this house will not fight for king and country\" ...  \n> So one cannot have lived through those years and not have some pretty strong feelings ... that it was the failure of the governments of the world to prevent aggression that made the catastrophe of World War II inevitable.[11]\n> \n> \n\n\n### Military in Southeast Asia[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nthe televised hearings were another blow to the prestige of the Johnson administration as it became very apparent to the viewers that a number of senators were now opposed to the war or were only lukewarm in their support.[109] When Fulbright asked Rusk to promise Congress a greater say in the war, Rusk replied that Johnson would consult \"appropriate members of Congress\".[110] When Senator Claiborne Pell asked if the war was worth all the suffering, Rusk charged that he was suffering from \"moral myopia\" about \"the endless struggle for freedom\".[110]\n\n\nOn April 17, during an American Society of Newspaper Editors luncheon meeting, Rusk admitted that the United States has taken \"some lumps\" propaganda wise but the Johnson administration should persist in trying to find a location of neutrality for the peace talks to occur.[111] The following day, Rusk added 10 sites to the 5 proposed initially, accusing Hanoi of having a propaganda battle over neutral areas for discussion during a press conference.[112]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn September 1964, a peace initiative was launched by the UN Secretary General U Thant who tried to set up secret peace talks in his native Burma, which were supported by the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev who pressured Ho Chi Minh to take part in the projected peace talks, saying he would only increase Soviet aid to North Vietnam if the North Vietnamese took part in a diplomatic effort to end the war first.[62] U Thant reported to Rusk that the Soviet pressure seemed to be working as North Vietnam's other arms supplier, China, could not match the hi-tech weaponry that only the Soviet Union could supply.[62] Rusk did not press on this information on Johnson, saying to take part in the planned talks in Burma would have signaled \"the acceptance or the confirmation of aggression\".[62] In October, the peace initiative was ended by Khrushchev being ousted and his successor, Leonid Brezhnev, was not interested in U Thant's plan.[62]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| List of international trips made by secretaries of state of the United States\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nAssistant Secretaries of State for International Organization Affairs\n |\n| --- |\n| * Rusk\n* Hickerson\n* Murphy\n* Key\n* Wilcox\n* Cleveland\n* Sisco\n* De Palma\n* Popper\n* Buffum\n* Lewis\n* Maynes\n* McCall\n* Abrams\n* Newell\n* Keyes\n* Williamson\n* Bolton\n* Bennet\n* Lyman\n* Welch\n* Holmes\n* Silverberg\n* Hook\n* Brimmer\n* Crocker\n* Moley\n* Sison\n | ![](image)\n |\n\n| Authority control databases ![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\n |\n| --- |\n| International | * FAST\n* ISNI\n* VIAF\n* WorldCat\n |\n| National | * France\n* BnF data\n* Germany\n* Italy\n* Israel\n* Belgium\n* United States\n* Sweden\n* Japan\n* Czech Republic\n* Australia\n* Netherlands\n* Poland\n |\n| Academics | * CiNii\n |\n| People | * Deutsche Biographie\n* Trove\n |\n| Other | * NARA\n* SNAC\n* IdRef\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nI didn't believe them then, and I don't believe them to this day. The attack was outrageous.”[38][39]\n\n\nAfter an Israeli claim appeared in *The Washington Post* that they had inquired about the presence of U.S. ships in the area before the attack, Rusk telegrammed the U.S. embassy in Tel Aviv and demanded “urgent confirmation.” U.S. Ambassador to Israel Walworth Barbour confirmed that Israel's story was bogus: “No request for info on U.S. ships operating off Sinai was made until after *Liberty* incident. Had Israelis made such an inquiry it would have been forwarded immediately to the chief of naval operations and other high naval commands and repeated to dept.”[40]\n\n\n\n### Asian affairs[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1950, Rusk was made assistant secretary of state for Far Eastern affairs, at his own request, arguing that he knew Asia the best.[14] He played an influential part in the US decision to become involved in the Korean War, and in Japan's postwar compensation for victorious countries, as shown in the Rusk documents. Rusk was a cautious diplomat and always sought international support. Rusk favored support for Asian nationalist movements, arguing that European imperialism was doomed in Asia, but the Atlanticist Acheson favored closer relations with the European powers, which precluded American support for Asian nationalism.[14] Rusk dutifully declared it was his duty to support Acheson.[14]\n\n\n\n#### French Indochina[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFollowing his retirement, he taught international law at the University of Georgia School of Law in Athens, Georgia (1970–1984). Rusk was emotionally exhausted after 8 years as Secretary of State and narrowly survived a nervous breakdown in 1969.[3] Roy Harris, a university regent who served as the Georgia campaign manager for the presidential campaign of George Wallace in 1968, tried to block Rusk's appointment under the ostensible grounds \"We don't want the university to be a haven for broken-down politicians\", but in reality because he was opposed to a man who had allowed his daughter to marry a black man.[126] However, Harris's vote was overruled. Rusk found that the return to teaching in 1970 and the resumption of the academic career he had abandoned in 1940 was emotionally satisfying. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAgainst the criticism made by Edward Lansdale of the embassy in Saigon, Rusk defended the performance of the State Department, saying South Vietnam was a difficult assignment.[29] On 9 March 1961, the communist Pathet Lao won a notable victory on the Plains of Jars, and for a moment the Pathet Lao seemed on the verge of seizing all of Laos.[30] Rusk expressed considerable disgust when he learned that neither side in the Lao civil war fought very hard, citing a report that both sides had broken off combat to go celebrate a water festival for ten days before resuming their battle.[31] Rusk, who had much experience of Southeast Asia during World War Two, expressed much doubt if bombing alone would stop the Pathet Lao, saying it was his experience that bombing only worked with ground troops to hold the ground or advance.[30]\n\n\n\n### Military plans[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWe must be able to say that all has been done.\"[82] When Johnson announced the bombing pause on Christmas Day 1965, Rusk told the press \"We have put everything into the basket of peace except the surrender of South Vietnam.\"[83] Some of the language that Rusk included in his offer for peace talks seemed to calculate to inspire rejection such as the demand that Hanoi must publicly vow \"to cease aggression\" and the bombing pause was \"a step toward peace, although there has not been the slightest hint or suggestion from the other side as to what they would do if the bombing stopped.\"[81] On December 28, 1965, Rusk sent a cable to Henry Cabot Lodge Jr, the ambassador in Saigon, presenting the bombing pause as merely a cynical exercise in public relations as he wrote: \"The prospect of large-scale reinforcements in men and defense budget increases for the next eighteen-month period requires solid preparation of the American public. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHe immersed himself in English history, politics, and popular culture, making lifelong friends among the British elite.[7] Rusk's rise from poverty made him a passionate believer in the \"American Dream\", and a recurring theme throughout his life was his oft-expressed patriotism, a place in which he believed that anyone, no matter how modest their circumstances, could rise up to live the \"American Dream\".[2]\n\n\nRusk married Virginia Foisie (October 5, 1915 – February 24, 1996) on June 9, 1937.[6] They had three children: David, Richard, and Peggy Rusk.[8]\n\n\nRusk taught at Mills College in Oakland, California, from 1934 to 1949 (except during his military service), and he earned an LL.B. degree at the University of California, Berkeley School of Law in 1940.[9]\n\n\n\n## Career prior to 1961[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn regards to the West New Guinea dispute about the Netherlands New Guinea, Rusk favored supporting the NATO ally Netherlands against Indonesia as he saw Sukarno as pro-Chinese.[42] Rusk accused Indonesia of aggression by attacking the Dutch forces in New Guinea in 1962 and believed that Sukarno had violated the United Nations charter, but was again overruled by Kennedy.[42] In a case of *realpolitik*, Kennedy argued the Dutch had no choice, but to be allied with the United States, meaning they could be taken for granted whereas he was highly concerned that Indonesia, which he called \"the most significant nation in Southeast Asia\", might become communist.[42] To improve relations with Sukarno, Kennedy decided to support the Indonesian claim to Dutch New Guinea; Rusk later wrote he felt \"queasy\" about the way that Kennedy sacrificed the Dutch to win over Indonesia and had strong doubts that the \"consultation\" scheduled to determine the future of the territory in 1969 would be a free and fair one.[42]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nA crucial element will be a clear demonstration that we have explored fully every alternative but the aggressors has left us no choice.\"[83] Rusk ordered Henry A. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the last days of the Johnson administration, the president wanted to nominate Rusk to the Supreme Court.[123] Although Rusk had studied the law, he did not have a law degree nor had he ever practiced law, but Johnson pointed out that the constitution did not require legal experience to serve on the Supreme Court and \"I've already talked to Dick Russell and he said you'd be confirmed easily.\"[123] However, Johnson failed to reckon with Senator James Eastland, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who was also a white supremacist and a supporter of segregation.[124] Through Eastland was a fellow Southerner, he had neither forgotten nor forgiven Rusk for allowing his daughter to marry a black man. Eastland announced he would not confirm Rusk if he were nominated to the Supreme Court.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPresident Nasser of Egypt was regarded as a trouble-maker in Washington owing to Egypt's alliance with the Soviet Union and his plans for a pan-Arab state that would of necessity require overthrowing the governments of every Arab state, most notably American allies such as Saudi Arabia.[43] In the Arab Cold War between Egypt and Saudi Arabia, Rusk favored the latter.[43] However, at the same time, Rusk argued to Kennedy to Nasser was a spoiler who wanted to play off the Soviet Union against the United States to get the best possible bargain for Egypt, and if he leaned in a pro-Soviet direction, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBecause Ho Chi Minh is tied with the Politburo, our policy is to support Bao Dai and the French in Indochina until we have time to help them establish a going concern.\"[17]\n\n\n\n#### Korean War[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nRusk felt that the United States had to support Saudi Arabia against Egypt, but he advised Kennedy against pushing Nasser too hard, saying that it would only drive him closer to the Soviet Union.[43] On October 8, 1962, a \"Food for Peace\" deal was signed with Egypt under the United States committed itself to sell at cost $390 million worth of wheat to Egypt for the next three years.[46] By 1962, Egypt imported 50% of its wheat consumed from the United States and owing to the PL 480 law was some $180 million per year at a time when Egypt's foreign reserves were almost deleted owing to a heavy level of military spending.[47]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Political party | Democratic |\n| Spouse | \nVirginia Foisie\n ​\n(m. 1937)​\n |\n| Children | 3, including Peggy, David and Richard |\n| Education | Davidson College (BA)St John's College, Oxford (BS, MA)University of California, Berkeley (LLB) |\n| Signature | ![](image) |\n| Military service |\n| Allegiance | ![](image) United States |\n| Branch/service | ![](image) United States Army |\n| Rank | ![](image) Colonel |\n| Battles/wars | World War II |\n| Awards | Legion of Merit |\n|  |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNasser had become very dependent upon the PL 480 food sales to provide food at cost to his people, and moreover the Soviet Union could not hope to match America's food sales to Egypt.[45] Nasser argued in exchange for PL 480 food sales that he would not start a war with Israel, saying for that for all his fiery speeches he promised to keep the Arab-Israeli dispute \"in the icebox\".[43] Rusk argued that to Kennedy and later Johnson that they should resist congressional pressure to end the PL 480 food sales to Egypt, stating that ending the PL 480 sales would only push Nasser closer to the Soviet Union and end the leverage that kept the peace between Egypt and Israel.[43] When Nasser sent 70, 000 Egyptian troops into Yemen in September 1962 to support the republican government against the royalist guerrillas supported by Saudi Arabia, Rusk approved of increased arm sales to Saudi Arabia, which were an indirect way of supporting the Yemeni royalists.[43] In common with decision-makers in Washington, \n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_UnG1MrkkHn58yA1UQhnydN3J","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

Kennedy. He is the father of biographer and historian John Maxwell Taylor and of military historian and author Thomas Happer Taylor.\n\n\nA controversial figure, Taylor was considered, along with Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, to have played a major role during the early days of the Vietnam War in the decision to deploy US combat troops to Vietnam and to escalate the conflict more generally.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)At West Point in 1922\nBorn in Keytesville, Missouri, and raised in Kansas City, Taylor graduated from Northeast High School and attended Kansas City Polytechnic Institute. In 1918, he passed competitive examinations for Congressional appointment by William Patterson Borland to either the United States Military Academy or United States Naval Academy and then passed the Military Academy entrance examination. Taylor attended West Point, graduated fourth in the Class of 1922, and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. He served in Hawaii with the 3rd Engineers from 1923 to 1926.\n\n\nTaylor transferred to the Field Artillery and, from 1926 to 1927, served with the 10th Field Artillery, receiving promotion to first lieutenant. Having demonstrated a facility for foreign languages, he studied French in Paris and was then assigned to West Point as an instructor in French and Spanish. He graduated from the Field Artillery School in 1933, and he completed the course at the United States Army Command and General Staff College in 1935.\n\n\nTaylor was promoted to captain in August 1935 and served at the American embassy in Tokyo from 1935 to 1939, including attaché duty in China in 1937. He graduated from the United States Army War College in 1940 and was promoted to major in July 1940.\n\n\n\n## World War II[edit]\n\n\n### Early assignments[edit]\n\n\nTaylor served on the War Plans Division staff in 1940 and took part in a defense cooperation mission to Latin American countries. He commanded the 1st Battalion of the 12th Field Artillery Regiment from 1940 to 1941, and then served in the Office of the Secretary of the General Staff until 1942. He received temporary promotions to lieutenant colonel in December 1941, colonel in February 1942, and brigadier general in December 1942.\n\n\n\n### Combat in Italy[edit]\n\n\nIn 1942, Taylor became chief of staff of the 82nd Airborne Division, followed by command of the 82nd Airborne Division Artillery, and took part in combat in Sicily and Italy. In 1943, during the planning for the Allied invasion of Italy, Taylor's diplomatic and language skills resulted in his secret mission to Rome to co-ordinate an 82nd air drop with Italian forces. General Dwight D. Eisenhower later said that \"the risks he ran were greater than I asked any other agent or emissary to take during the war.\"[2]\n\n\nHundreds of miles behind the front lines of battle, Taylor was forced by the rules of engagement to wear his American military uniform to prevent himself, if captured, from being shot as a spy. He met with the new Italian prime minister, Marshal Pietro Badoglio, and General Carboni. The air drop near Rome to capture the city was called off at the last minute since Taylor realized that German forces were already moving in to cover the intended drop zones. Transport planes were already in the air when Taylor's message canceled the drop, preventing the mission. His efforts behind enemy lines got Taylor noticed at the highest levels of the Allied command.\n\n\n\n### 101st Airborne Division[edit]\n\n\nAfter the campaigns in the Mediterranean, Taylor was assigned to become the Commanding General (CG) of the 101st Airborne Division, nicknamed \"The Screaming Eagles\", which was then training in England in preparation for the Allied invasion of Normandy, after the division's first commander, Major General William Lee, suffered a heart attack. Taylor received temporary promotion to major general in May 1944.\n\n\n\n![](image)Taylor, pictured here on the left, receiving the Distinguished Service Order from General Sir Bernard Montgomery for gallantry in action at Carentan, France, June 12, 1944.\nTaylor took part in the division's parachute jump into Normandy on June 6, 1944 (D-Day), the first Allied general officer to land in France on D-Day. He subsequently commanded the 101st in the Battle of Normandy, including in the capture of Carentan on June 13, and the division continued to fight in the campaign as regular infantry. The 101st Airborne Division was pulled out of the line in late June, having been in almost continuous action for nearly a month, and in early July, he returned to England to rest and refit and absorb replacements, after having suffered over 4,600 casualties.\n\n\nHaving been brought up to strength, Taylor led the 101st in Operation Market Garden in the Netherlands in September 1944. He was not present for the division's action during the Siege of Bastogne as part of the Battle of the Bulge since he was attending a staff conference in the United States. The Divisional Artillery commander, Brigadier General Anthony McAuliffe, exercised command in his absence. Taylor called the defense of Bastogne the 101st Airborne Division's \"finest hour\" of the war and stated that his absence was one of his greatest disappointments of the war.[3] After Bastogne, Taylor's 101st saw little further service in the war and was sent to the United States in late 1945, where it was deactivated in November.\n\n\n\n## Post-World War II[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Honor Monument at West Point\nOn September 4, 1945, Taylor became superintendent of the United States Military Academy.[4][5][6] In 1947, he drafted the first official Honor Code publication marking the beginning of the written \"Cadet Honor Code\" at West Point.[7] He was succeeded by Bryant Moore on January 28, 1949.[8] Afterwards he was the commander of allied troops in West Berlin from 1949 to 1951; when he left that post, he felt like a \"Berliner,\" more than a decade before John F. Kennedy gave his famous \"Ich bin ein Berliner\" speech in the city.[9] In July 1951 he was promoted to lieutenant general and assigned as the U.S. Army Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and Administration at the Pentagon.\n\n\nIn June 1953, he was sent to Korea, where he commanded the Eighth United States Army during the final combat operations of the Korean War. From 1955 to 1959, he was the Army Chief of Staff -- becoming the first officer since 1917 to serve as Chief of Staff without seeing service during World War I -- succeeding his former mentor, Matthew B. Ridgway. During his tenure, Taylor attempted to guide the service into the age of nuclear weapons by restructuring the infantry division into a Pentomic formation. Observers such as Colonel David Hackworth have written that the effort gutted the role of US Army company and field grade officers, rendering it unable to adapt to the dynamics of combat in Vietnam.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nDuring 1957, President Dwight D. Eisenhower ordered Taylor to deploy 1,000 troops from the 101st Airborne Division to Little Rock, Arkansas to enforce federal court orders to desegregate Central High School during the Little Rock Crisis.\n\n\nAs Army Chief of Staff, Taylor was an outspoken critic of the Eisenhower administration's \"New Look\" defense policy, which he viewed as dangerously overreliant on nuclear arms and neglectful of conventional forces; Taylor also criticized the inadequacies of the Joint Chiefs of Staff system. Frustrated with the administration's failure to heed his arguments, Taylor retired from active service in July 1959. He campaigned publicly against the \"New Look,\" culminating in the publication in January 1960 of a highly critical book, *The Uncertain Trumpet*.\n\n\n\n## Return to active duty[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This article **needs additional citations for verification**.

Kennedy criticized Eisenhower's defense policy and championed a muscular \"flexible response\" policy intentionally aligned with Taylor's views as described in *The Uncertain Trumpet*. After the April 1961 failure of the Bay of Pigs Invasion, Kennedy, who felt the Joint Chiefs of Staff had failed to provide him with satisfactory military advice, appointed Taylor to head a task force to investigate the failure of the invasion.\n\n\nBoth President Kennedy and his brother, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, had immense regard for Taylor, whom they saw as a man of unquestionable integrity, sincerity, intelligence, and diplomacy.[*citation needed*] The Cuba Study Group met for six weeks from April to May 1961 to perform an \"autopsy\" on the disastrous events surrounding the Bay of Pigs Invasion. In the course of their work together, Taylor developed a deep regard and a personal affection for Robert F. Kennedy, a friendship that was wholly mutual and which remained firm until RFK's assassination in 1968.\n\n\nTaylor spoke of Robert Kennedy glowingly: \"He is always on the lookout for a 'snow job,' impatient with evasion and imprecision, and relentless in his determination to get at the truth.\" In January, 1965 Robert Kennedy named his next-to-last son Matthew Maxwell Taylor Kennedy (better known as an adult as \"Max\").\n\n\nShortly after the investigation concluded, the Kennedys' warm feelings for Taylor and the President's lack of confidence in the Joint Chiefs of Staff led John Kennedy to recall Taylor to active duty and install him in the newly created post of military representative to the president. His close personal relationship with the President and White House access effectively made Taylor the President's primary military adviser, cutting out the Joint Chiefs. On October 1, 1962, Kennedy ended this uncomfortable arrangement by appointing Taylor as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a position in which he served until 1964.\n\n\n\n## Vietnam War[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Taylor-Rostow Report, 1963 South Vietnamese coup, Arrest and assassination of Ngo Dinh Diem, Reaction to the 1963 South Vietnamese coup, Cable 243, Buddhist crisis, Krulak Mendenhall mission, and McNamara Taylor mission\n\nTaylor was of crucial importance during the first few years of the Vietnam War, during his time as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and later being appointed Ambassador to the Republic of Vietnam. Whereas Kennedy told Taylor in October 1961 that \"the independence of South Vietnam rests with the people and government of that country\", Taylor soon recommended that 8,000 American combat troops be sent to the region at once. After making his report to the Cabinet and the Chiefs of Staff (with Deputy National Security Adviser Walt Rostow), Taylor reflected on the decision to send troops to South Vietnam: \"I don't recall anyone who was strongly against, except one man, and that was the President. The President just didn't want to be convinced that this was the right thing to do.... It was really the President's personal conviction that U.S. ground troops shouldn't go in.\"[10]\n\n\nIn May 1963, mass protests and civil disobedience broke out in South Vietnam in response to President Ngo Dinh Diem's persecution of the Buddhist majority, which was met with military crackdowns, culminating in nationwide raids on Buddhist temples.[11] In the wake of the raids, the US sent out Cable 243, which called for Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. to lobby for the removal from influence of Diem's younger brother and chief political adviser Ngo Dinh Nhu, and to look for alternative leadership options if Diem refused. As it was known that Diem would never sideline Nhu, it was effectively an authorisation for Lodge to encourage a military coup.[12][13][14] The cable was prepared and sent out over a weekend when many leading Washington figures were away, under the misunderstanding that higher authorisation had been given. Marine General Victor Krulak signed off on behalf of the military without showing Taylor,[15] who was a supporter of Diem. On Monday August 26, at the White House, Kennedy was met with angry comments by Secretary of State Dean Rusk, Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara, CIA Director John McCone and Taylor, all of whom denied authorizing the cable. Kennedy was reported to have said \"My God! My government's coming apart.\"[16] Taylor felt insulted by the final line of the cable which asserted that only the \"minimum essential people\" had seen its contents.[16] During the acrimonious exchange, he condemned the cable as an \"egregious end run\" by an anti-Diem faction.[16] Roger Hilsman rebutted Taylor by asserting that Kennedy and representatives of departments and agencies had approved the message. Years afterward, Taylor declared \"The anti-Diem group centered in State [department] had taken advantage of the absence of the principal officials to get out instructions which would never have been approved as written under normal circumstances\".[17] Taylor claimed that the message was reflective of Forrestal and Hilsman's \"well-known compulsion\" to remove Diem.[18] He accused them of pulling \"a fast one\".[16] Kennedy asked his advisers if they wanted to retract the cable, but they agreed to stand by the original decision to maintain consistency. Taylor said that \"You can't change American policy in twenty-four hours and expect anyone to ever believe you again.\"[16] Taylor also objected to two phone calls on August 24 to Washington from Admiral Harry D. Felt, the commander of US forces in the Pacific, calling for backing to the generals to remove Nhu. Felt said that the mid-level officers would not fight if Nhu was not removed. Taylor became angry that Felt had advised the State Department to move against Diem without first consulting the Joint Chiefs of Staff.[19] Taylor then told Kennedy that Americans would not tolerate their officers selecting the president, and thus they should not usurp the cabinet in doing the same in South Vietnam.[20]\n\n\nTaylor remained opposed to any moves towards the disposal of Diem. Years afterward, he said that Diem was \"a terrible pain in the neck\", but was a devoted servant of his country.[19] Taylor called on Kennedy to support Diem until a better leader had been lined up, pointing out that the officers were divided and therefore could not be relied on to plot and stage a coup.[19]\n\n\n\nMain articles: January 1964 South Vietnamese coup, September 1964 South Vietnamese coup attempt, December 1964 South Vietnamese coup, and 1965 South Vietnamese coup\n\nThe junta led by General Duong Van Minh following Diem's removal lasted three months until General Nguyen Khanh toppled Minh in January 1964. Taylor and other military officials had disagreed with Minh's reluctance to carry out large-scale offensives against the communists and wanted a more aggressive approach.[21] He was known to regard Khanh as the more competent ARVN general.[22] However, Taylor changed his opinion upon being made Ambassador to South Vietnam in July 1964 when Lodge returned to the US.\n\n\nIn August, following widespread Buddhist protests, some senior officers, particularly the Catholic Generals Tran Thien Khiem and Nguyễn Văn Thiệu, decried Khanh's concessions to the Buddhists.[23] They plotted Khánh's removal and sought out Taylor for a private endorsement, but Taylor did not want any more leadership changes, fearing a corrosive effect on the already-unstable government. This deterred Khiêm's group from acting on their plans.[24] On September 13, another coup attempt led by Catholic Generals Duong Van Duc and Lam Van Phat started while Taylor was on a flight from the US[25]—back to Saigon and catching him off-guard.[26] The coup failed, and Taylor helped organize for Khiêm to be made Saigon's representative in Washington.[27] During the coup, Minh had remained silent, angering Khánh and keeping their long-running rivalry going. By the end of October, the Johnson administration had become more supportive of Taylor's negative opinion of Minh and eventually paid for Minh to go on a \"good will tour\" to remove him from the political scene.[27]\n\n\nTaylor frequently clashed with General Nguyen Khanh and helped to engineer his removal, having supported Khanh's deposal of General Duong Van Minh.\n\n\n\n## Criticisms[edit]\n\n\nTaylor received fierce criticism in Major (later Lieutenant General and National Security Advisor) H.R. McMaster's book *Dereliction of Duty.* Specifically, Taylor was accused of intentionally misrepresenting the views of the Joint Chiefs to Defense Secretary Robert McNamara and of cutting the Joint Chiefs out of the decision-making process.[28]\n\n\nWhereas the Chiefs felt that it was their duty to offer unbiased assessments and recommendations on military matters, Taylor was of the firm belief that the chairman should not only support the president's decisions but also be a true believer in them. That discrepancy manifested itself during the early planning phases of the war while it was still being decided what the nature of American involvement should be. McNamara and the civilians of the office of the secretary of defense were firmly behind the idea of graduated pressure: to escalate pressure slowly against North Vietnam in order to demonstrate U.S. resolve. The Joint Chiefs, however, strenuously disagreed with that and believed that if the US got involved further in Vietnam, it should be with the clear intention of winning and through the use of overwhelming force. McMaster contends that using a variety of political maneuvering, including liberal use of outright deception, Taylor succeeded in keeping the Joint Chiefs' opinions away from the President and helped set the stage for McNamara to begin to dominate systematically the U.S. decision making process on Vietnam.\n\n\nTaylor was also criticized by Tom Ricks in his book *The Generals* (2012): \"Maxwell Taylor arguably was the most destructive general in American history. As Army chief of staff in the 1950s, he steered the US military toward engaging in 'brushfire wars.' As White House military adviser during the early 1960s, he encouraged President John F. Kennedy to deepen American involvement in Vietnam. As chairman of the Joint Chiefs, he poisoned relations between the military and civilian leadership. He was also key in picking Gen. William Westmoreland to command the war there.\"\n\n\n\n## Second retirement[edit]\n\n\nTaylor again retired from the Army on July 1, 1964, having been succeeded as Chairman of the Joint Chief of Staff by General Earle Wheeler, and became Ambassador to South Vietnam from 1964 to 1965, succeeding Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. Taylor served in the Pentagon during parts of 1965 as \"SACSA\", the Special Advisor for Counterinsurgency Affairs\". He was Special Consultant to the President and Chairman of the Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board (1965–1969) and President of the Institute for Defense Analyses (1966–1969).\n\n\nAfflicted with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (also called \"Lou Gehrig's disease\"), Taylor spent his last three months at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, DC, and died at 85 years of age on April 19, 1987.[1] He was interred at Arlington National Cemetery.[29]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)This shot was taken on the day that Captain Thomas Happer Taylor arrived in Vietnam to begin his service there and met his father General Taylor on the same day the latter left Vietnam. General William Westmoreland is in the background.\nIn 1925, Taylor married the former Lydia Gardner Happer (1901–1997). They had two sons: John Maxwell Taylor and Thomas Happer Taylor, the latter being a West Point graduate (Class of 1960) and Army officer.\n\n\n\n## Dramatic portrayals[edit]\n\n\n* Taylor was

Kennedy. He is the father of biographer and historian John Maxwell Taylor and of military historian and author Thomas Happer Taylor.\n\n\nA controversial figure, Taylor was considered, along with Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, to have played a major role during the early days of the Vietnam War in the decision to deploy US combat troops to Vietnam and to escalate the conflict more generally.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)At West Point in 1922\nBorn in Keytesville, Missouri, and raised in Kansas City, Taylor graduated from Northeast High School and attended Kansas City Polytechnic Institute. In 1918, he passed competitive examinations for Congressional appointment by William Patterson Borland to either the United States Military Academy or United States Naval Academy and then passed the Military Academy entrance examination. Taylor attended West Point, graduated fourth in the Class of 1922, and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. He served in Hawaii with the 3rd Engineers from 1923 to 1926.\n\n\nTaylor transferred to the Field Artillery and, from 1926 to 1927, served with the 10th Field Artillery, receiving promotion to first lieutenant. Having demonstrated a facility for foreign languages, he studied French in Paris and was then assigned to West Point as an instructor in French and Spanish. He graduated from the Field Artillery School in 1933, and he completed the course at the United States Army Command and General Staff College in 1935.\n\n\nTaylor was promoted to captain in August 1935 and served at the American embassy in Tokyo from 1935 to 1939, including attaché duty in China in 1937. He graduated from the United States Army War College in 1940 and was promoted to major in July 1940.\n\n\n\n## World War II[edit]\n\n\n### Early assignments[edit]\n\n\nTaylor served on the War Plans Division staff in 1940 and took part in a defense cooperation mission to Latin American countries. He commanded the 1st Battalion of the 12th Field Artillery Regiment from 1940 to 1941, and then served in the Office of the Secretary of the General Staff until 1942. He received temporary promotions to lieutenant colonel in December 1941, colonel in February 1942, and brigadier general in December 1942.\n\n\n\n### Combat in Italy[edit]\n\n\nIn 1942, Taylor became chief of staff of the 82nd Airborne Division, followed by command of the 82nd Airborne Division Artillery, and took part in combat in Sicily and Italy. In 1943, during the planning for the Allied invasion of Italy, Taylor's diplomatic and language skills resulted in his secret mission to Rome to co-ordinate an 82nd air drop with Italian forces. General Dwight D. Eisenhower later said that \"the risks he ran were greater than I asked any other agent or emissary to take during the war.\"[2]\n\n\nHundreds of miles behind the front lines of battle, Taylor was forced by the rules of engagement to wear his American military uniform to prevent himself, if captured, from being shot as a spy. He met with the new Italian prime minister, Marshal Pietro Badoglio, and General Carboni. The air drop near Rome to capture the city was called off at the last minute since Taylor realized that German forces were already moving in to cover the intended drop zones. Transport planes were already in the air when Taylor's message canceled the drop, preventing the mission. His efforts behind enemy lines got Taylor noticed at the highest levels of the Allied command.\n\n\n\n### 101st Airborne Division[edit]\n\n\nAfter the campaigns in the Mediterranean, Taylor was assigned to become the Commanding General (CG) of the 101st Airborne Division, nicknamed \"The Screaming Eagles\", which was then training in England in preparation for the Allied invasion of Normandy, after the division's first commander, Major General William Lee, suffered a heart attack. Taylor received temporary promotion to major general in May 1944.\n\n\n\n![](image)Taylor, pictured here on the left, receiving the Distinguished Service Order from General Sir Bernard Montgomery for gallantry in action at Carentan, France, June 12, 1944.\nTaylor took part in the division's parachute jump into Normandy on June 6, 1944 (D-Day), the first Allied general officer to land in France on D-Day. He subsequently commanded the 101st in the Battle of Normandy, including in the capture of Carentan on June 13, and the division continued to fight in the campaign as regular infantry. The 101st Airborne Division was pulled out of the line in late June, having been in almost continuous action for nearly a month, and in early July, he returned to England to rest and refit and absorb replacements, after having suffered over 4,600 casualties.\n\n\nHaving been brought up to strength, Taylor led the 101st in Operation Market Garden in the Netherlands in September 1944. He was not present for the division's action during the Siege of Bastogne as part of the Battle of the Bulge since he was attending a staff conference in the United States. The Divisional Artillery commander, Brigadier General Anthony McAuliffe, exercised command in his absence. Taylor called the defense of Bastogne the 101st Airborne Division's \"finest hour\" of the war and stated that his absence was one of his greatest disappointments of the war.[3] After Bastogne, Taylor's 101st saw little further service in the war and was sent to the United States in late 1945, where it was deactivated in November.\n\n\n\n## Post-World War II[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Honor Monument at West Point\nOn September 4, 1945, Taylor became superintendent of the United States Military Academy.[4][5][6] In 1947, he drafted the first official Honor Code publication marking the beginning of the written \"Cadet Honor Code\" at West Point.[7] He was succeeded by Bryant Moore on January 28, 1949.[8] Afterwards he was the commander of allied troops in West Berlin from 1949 to 1951; when he left that post, he felt like a \"Berliner,\" more than a decade before John F. Kennedy gave his famous \"Ich bin ein Berliner\" speech in the city.[9] In July 1951 he was promoted to lieutenant general and assigned as the U.S. Army Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and Administration at the Pentagon.\n\n\nIn June 1953, he was sent to Korea, where he commanded the Eighth United States Army during the final combat operations of the Korean War. From 1955 to 1959, he was the Army Chief of Staff -- becoming the first officer since 1917 to serve as Chief of Staff without seeing service during World War I -- succeeding his former mentor, Matthew B. Ridgway. During his tenure, Taylor attempted to guide the service into the age of nuclear weapons by restructuring the infantry division into a Pentomic formation. Observers such as Colonel David Hackworth have written that the effort gutted the role of US Army company and field grade officers, rendering it unable to adapt to the dynamics of combat in Vietnam.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nDuring 1957, President Dwight D. Eisenhower ordered Taylor to deploy 1,000 troops from the 101st Airborne Division to Little Rock, Arkansas to enforce federal court orders to desegregate Central High School during the Little Rock Crisis.\n\n\nAs Army Chief of Staff, Taylor was an outspoken critic of the Eisenhower administration's \"New Look\" defense policy, which he viewed as dangerously overreliant on nuclear arms and neglectful of conventional forces; Taylor also criticized the inadequacies of the Joint Chiefs of Staff system. Frustrated with the administration's failure to heed his arguments, Taylor retired from active service in July 1959. He campaigned publicly against the \"New Look,\" culminating in the publication in January 1960 of a highly critical book, *The Uncertain Trumpet*.\n\n\n\n## Return to active duty[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This article **needs additional citations for verification**.

Kennedy criticized Eisenhower's defense policy and championed a muscular \"flexible response\" policy intentionally aligned with Taylor's views as described in *The Uncertain Trumpet*. After the April 1961 failure of the Bay of Pigs Invasion, Kennedy, who felt the Joint Chiefs of Staff had failed to provide him with satisfactory military advice, appointed Taylor to head a task force to investigate the failure of the invasion.\n\n\nBoth President Kennedy and his brother, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, had immense regard for Taylor, whom they saw as a man of unquestionable integrity, sincerity, intelligence, and diplomacy.[*citation needed*] The Cuba Study Group met for six weeks from April to May 1961 to perform an \"autopsy\" on the disastrous events surrounding the Bay of Pigs Invasion. In the course of their work together, Taylor developed a deep regard and a personal affection for Robert F. Kennedy, a friendship that was wholly mutual and which remained firm until RFK's assassination in 1968.\n\n\nTaylor spoke of Robert Kennedy glowingly: \"He is always on the lookout for a 'snow job,' impatient with evasion and imprecision, and relentless in his determination to get at the truth.\" In January, 1965 Robert Kennedy named his next-to-last son Matthew Maxwell Taylor Kennedy (better known as an adult as \"Max\").\n\n\nShortly after the investigation concluded, the Kennedys' warm feelings for Taylor and the President's lack of confidence in the Joint Chiefs of Staff led John Kennedy to recall Taylor to active duty and install him in the newly created post of military representative to the president. His close personal relationship with the President and White House access effectively made Taylor the President's primary military adviser, cutting out the Joint Chiefs. On October 1, 1962, Kennedy ended this uncomfortable arrangement by appointing Taylor as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a position in which he served until 1964.\n\n\n\n## Vietnam War[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Taylor-Rostow Report, 1963 South Vietnamese coup, Arrest and assassination of Ngo Dinh Diem, Reaction to the 1963 South Vietnamese coup, Cable 243, Buddhist crisis, Krulak Mendenhall mission, and McNamara Taylor mission\n\nTaylor was of crucial importance during the first few years of the Vietnam War, during his time as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and later being appointed Ambassador to the Republic of Vietnam. Whereas Kennedy told Taylor in October 1961 that \"the independence of South Vietnam rests with the people and government of that country\", Taylor soon recommended that 8,000 American combat troops be sent to the region at once. After making his report to the Cabinet and the Chiefs of Staff (with Deputy National Security Adviser Walt Rostow), Taylor reflected on the decision to send troops to South Vietnam: \"I don't recall anyone who was strongly against, except one man, and that was the President. The President just didn't want to be convinced that this was the right thing to do.... It was really the President's personal conviction that U.S. ground troops shouldn't go in.\"[10]\n\n\nIn May 1963, mass protests and civil disobedience broke out in South Vietnam in response to President Ngo Dinh Diem's persecution of the Buddhist majority, which was met with military crackdowns, culminating in nationwide raids on Buddhist temples.[11] In the wake of the raids, the US sent out Cable 243, which called for Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. to lobby for the removal from influence of Diem's younger brother and chief political adviser Ngo Dinh Nhu, and to look for alternative leadership options if Diem refused. As it was known that Diem would never sideline Nhu, it was effectively an authorisation for Lodge to encourage a military coup.[12][13][14] The cable was prepared and sent out over a weekend when many leading Washington figures were away, under the misunderstanding that higher authorisation had been given. Marine General Victor Krulak signed off on behalf of the military without showing Taylor,[15] who was a supporter of Diem. On Monday August 26, at the White House, Kennedy was met with angry comments by Secretary of State Dean Rusk, Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara, CIA Director John McCone and Taylor, all of whom denied authorizing the cable. Kennedy was reported to have said \"My God! My government's coming apart.\"[16] Taylor felt insulted by the final line of the cable which asserted that only the \"minimum essential people\" had seen its contents.[16] During the acrimonious exchange, he condemned the cable as an \"egregious end run\" by an anti-Diem faction.[16] Roger Hilsman rebutted Taylor by asserting that Kennedy and representatives of departments and agencies had approved the message. Years afterward, Taylor declared \"The anti-Diem group centered in State [department] had taken advantage of the absence of the principal officials to get out instructions which would never have been approved as written under normal circumstances\".[17] Taylor claimed that the message was reflective of Forrestal and Hilsman's \"well-known compulsion\" to remove Diem.[18] He accused them of pulling \"a fast one\".[16] Kennedy asked his advisers if they wanted to retract the cable, but they agreed to stand by the original decision to maintain consistency. Taylor said that \"You can't change American policy in twenty-four hours and expect anyone to ever believe you again.\"[16] Taylor also objected to two phone calls on August 24 to Washington from Admiral Harry D. Felt, the commander of US forces in the Pacific, calling for backing to the generals to remove Nhu. Felt said that the mid-level officers would not fight if Nhu was not removed. Taylor became angry that Felt had advised the State Department to move against Diem without first consulting the Joint Chiefs of Staff.[19] Taylor then told Kennedy that Americans would not tolerate their officers selecting the president, and thus they should not usurp the cabinet in doing the same in South Vietnam.[20]\n\n\nTaylor remained opposed to any moves towards the disposal of Diem. Years afterward, he said that Diem was \"a terrible pain in the neck\", but was a devoted servant of his country.[19] Taylor called on Kennedy to support Diem until a better leader had been lined up, pointing out that the officers were divided and therefore could not be relied on to plot and stage a coup.[19]\n\n\n\nMain articles: January 1964 South Vietnamese coup, September 1964 South Vietnamese coup attempt, December 1964 South Vietnamese coup, and 1965 South Vietnamese coup\n\nThe junta led by General Duong Van Minh following Diem's removal lasted three months until General Nguyen Khanh toppled Minh in January 1964. Taylor and other military officials had disagreed with Minh's reluctance to carry out large-scale offensives against the communists and wanted a more aggressive approach.[21] He was known to regard Khanh as the more competent ARVN general.[22] However, Taylor changed his opinion upon being made Ambassador to South Vietnam in July 1964 when Lodge returned to the US.\n\n\nIn August, following widespread Buddhist protests, some senior officers, particularly the Catholic Generals Tran Thien Khiem and Nguyễn Văn Thiệu, decried Khanh's concessions to the Buddhists.[23] They plotted Khánh's removal and sought out Taylor for a private endorsement, but Taylor did not want any more leadership changes, fearing a corrosive effect on the already-unstable government. This deterred Khiêm's group from acting on their plans.[24] On September 13, another coup attempt led by Catholic Generals Duong Van Duc and Lam Van Phat started while Taylor was on a flight from the US[25]—back to Saigon and catching him off-guard.[26] The coup failed, and Taylor helped organize for Khiêm to be made Saigon's representative in Washington.[27] During the coup, Minh had remained silent, angering Khánh and keeping their long-running rivalry going. By the end of October, the Johnson administration had become more supportive of Taylor's negative opinion of Minh and eventually paid for Minh to go on a \"good will tour\" to remove him from the political scene.[27]\n\n\nTaylor frequently clashed with General Nguyen Khanh and helped to engineer his removal, having supported Khanh's deposal of General Duong Van Minh.\n\n\n\n## Criticisms[edit]\n\n\nTaylor received fierce criticism in Major (later Lieutenant General and National Security Advisor) H.R. McMaster's book *Dereliction of Duty.* Specifically, Taylor was accused of intentionally misrepresenting the views of the Joint Chiefs to Defense Secretary Robert McNamara and of cutting the Joint Chiefs out of the decision-making process.[28]\n\n\nWhereas the Chiefs felt that it was their duty to offer unbiased assessments and recommendations on military matters, Taylor was of the firm belief that the chairman should not only support the president's decisions but also be a true believer in them. That discrepancy manifested itself during the early planning phases of the war while it was still being decided what the nature of American involvement should be. McNamara and the civilians of the office of the secretary of defense were firmly behind the idea of graduated pressure: to escalate pressure slowly against North Vietnam in order to demonstrate U.S. resolve. The Joint Chiefs, however, strenuously disagreed with that and believed that if the US got involved further in Vietnam, it should be with the clear intention of winning and through the use of overwhelming force. McMaster contends that using a variety of political maneuvering, including liberal use of outright deception, Taylor succeeded in keeping the Joint Chiefs' opinions away from the President and helped set the stage for McNamara to begin to dominate systematically the U.S. decision making process on Vietnam.\n\n\nTaylor was also criticized by Tom Ricks in his book *The Generals* (2012): \"Maxwell Taylor arguably was the most destructive general in American history. As Army chief of staff in the 1950s, he steered the US military toward engaging in 'brushfire wars.' As White House military adviser during the early 1960s, he encouraged President John F. Kennedy to deepen American involvement in Vietnam. As chairman of the Joint Chiefs, he poisoned relations between the military and civilian leadership. He was also key in picking Gen. William Westmoreland to command the war there.\"\n\n\n\n## Second retirement[edit]\n\n\nTaylor again retired from the Army on July 1, 1964, having been succeeded as Chairman of the Joint Chief of Staff by General Earle Wheeler, and became Ambassador to South Vietnam from 1964 to 1965, succeeding Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. Taylor served in the Pentagon during parts of 1965 as \"SACSA\", the Special Advisor for Counterinsurgency Affairs\". He was Special Consultant to the President and Chairman of the Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board (1965–1969) and President of the Institute for Defense Analyses (1966–1969).\n\n\nAfflicted with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (also called \"Lou Gehrig's disease\"), Taylor spent his last three months at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, DC, and died at 85 years of age on April 19, 1987.[1] He was interred at Arlington National Cemetery.[29]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)This shot was taken on the day that Captain Thomas Happer Taylor arrived in Vietnam to begin his service there and met his father General Taylor on the same day the latter left Vietnam. General William Westmoreland is in the background.\nIn 1925, Taylor married the former Lydia Gardner Happer (1901–1997). They had two sons: John Maxwell Taylor and Thomas Happer Taylor, the latter being a West Point graduate (Class of 1960) and Army officer.\n\n\n\n## Dramatic portrayals[edit]\n\n\n* Taylor was
