It is the tallest mountain in the world from base-to-peak on land, measuring 18,000\u00a0ft (5,500\u00a0m),[8] and Earth's highest mountain north of 43\u00b0N. With a topographic prominence of 20,194 feet (6,155\u00a0m)[3] and a topographic isolation of 4,621.1 miles (7,436.9\u00a0km),[3] Denali is the third most prominent and third-most isolated peak on Earth, after Mount Everest and Aconcagua. Located in the Alaska Range in the interior of the U.S. state of Alaska, Denali is the centerpiece of Denali National Park and Preserve.\n\n\n\n![](image)An aerial photo Denali in 1987\nThe Koyukon people who inhabit the area around the mountain have referred to the peak as \"Denali\" for centuries. In 1896, a gold prospector named it \"Mount McKinley\" in support of then-presidential candidate William McKinley; that name was the official name recognized by the federal government of the United States from 1917 until 2015. In August 2015, 40 years after Alaska had done so, the United States Department of the Interior announced the change of the official name of the mountain to Denali.[9][10]\n\n\nIn 1903, James Wickersham recorded the first attempt at climbing Denali, which was unsuccessful. In 1906, Frederick Cook claimed the first ascent, but this ascent is unverified and its legitimacy questioned. The first verifiable ascent to Denali's summit was achieved on June 7, 1913, by climbers Hudson Stuck, Harry Karstens, Walter Harper, and Robert Tatum, who went by the South Summit. In 1951, Bradford Washburn pioneered the West Buttress route, considered to be the safest and easiest route, and therefore the most popular currently in use.[11]\n\n\nOn September 2, 2015, the U.S. Geological Survey announced that the mountain is 20,310 feet (6,190\u00a0m) high,[1] not 20,320 feet (6,194\u00a0m), as measured in 1952 using photogrammetry.\n\n\n\n\n## Geology and features[edit]\n\n\nDenali is a granitic pluton, mostly pink quartz monzonite, lifted by tectonic pressure from the subduction of the Pacific Plate beneath the North American Plate; at the same time, the sedimentary material above and around the mountain was stripped away by erosion.[12][13] The forces that lifted Denali also caused many deep earthquakes in Alaska and the Aleutian Islands. The Pacific Plate is seismically active beneath Denali, a tectonic region that is known as the \"McKinley cluster\".[14]\n\n\nDenali has a summit elevation of 20,310 feet (6,190\u00a0m) above sea level, making it the highest peak in North America and the northernmost mountain above 19,685 feet (6,000\u00a0m) elevation in the world.[1] Measured from base to peak at some 18,000\u00a0ft (5,500\u00a0m), it is among the largest mountains situated entirely above sea level. Denali rises from a sloping plain with elevations from 1,000 to 3,000\u00a0ft (300 to 910\u00a0m), for a base-to-peak height of 17,000 to 19,000\u00a0ft (5,000 to 6,000\u00a0m).[15]\n\n\nBy comparison, Mount Everest rises from the Tibetan Plateau at a much higher base elevation. Base elevations for Everest range from 13,800\u00a0ft (4,200\u00a0m) on the south side to 17,100\u00a0ft (5,200\u00a0m) on the Tibetan Plateau, for a base-to-peak height in the range of 12,000 to 15,300\u00a0ft (3,700 to 4,700\u00a0m).[16] Denali's base-to-peak height is little more than half the 33,500\u00a0ft (10,200\u00a0m) of the volcano Mauna Kea, which lies mostly under water.[17]\n\n\n\n### Geography of the mountain[edit]\n\n\nDenali has two significant summits: the South Summit is the higher one, while the North Summit has an elevation of 19,470\u00a0ft (5,934\u00a0m)[12] and a prominence of approximately 1,270\u00a0ft (387\u00a0m).[18] The North Summit is sometimes counted as a separate peak (see e.g., fourteener) and sometimes not; it is rarely climbed, except by those doing routes on the north side of the massif.\n\n\nFive large glaciers flow off the slopes of the mountain. The Peters Glacier lies on the northwest side of the massif, while the Muldrow Glacier falls from its northeast slopes. Just to the east of the Muldrow, and abutting the eastern side of the massif, is the Traleika Glacier. The Ruth Glacier lies to the southeast of the mountain, and the Kahiltna Glacier leads up to the southwest side of the mountain.[19][20] With a length of 44\u00a0mi (71\u00a0km), the Kahiltna Glacier is the longest glacier in the Alaska Range.\n\n\n\n## Naming[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Denali\u2013Mount McKinley naming dispute\n\nThe Koyukon Athabaskans who inhabit the area around the mountain have for centuries referred to the peak as *Dinale* or *Denali*. The name is based on a Koyukon word for 'high' or 'tall'.[21] During the Russian ownership of Alaska, the common name for the mountain was *Bolshaya Gora* (Russian: \u0411\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0430\u044f \u0413\u043e\u0440\u0430; *bolshaya* 'big'; *gora* 'mountain'), which is the Russian translation of *Denali*.[22] It was briefly called Densmore's Mountain in the late 1880s and early 1890s[23] after Frank Densmore, a gold prospector who was the first non-native Alaskan to reach the base of the mountain.[24]\n\n\nIn 1896, a gold prospector named it *McKinley* as political support for then-presidential candidate William McKinley, who became president the following year. The United States formally recognized the name Mount McKinley after President Wilson signed the Mount McKinley National Park Act of February 26, 1917.[25] In 1965, Lyndon B. Johnson declared the north and south peaks of the mountain the \"Churchill Peaks\", in honor of British statesman Winston Churchill.[26] The Alaska Board of Geographic Names changed the name of the mountain to *Denali* in 1975, which was how it is called locally.[7][27] However, a request in 1975 from the Alaska state legislature to the United States Board on Geographic Names to do the same at the federal level was blocked by Ohio congressman Ralph Regula, whose district included McKinley's home town of Canton.[28]\n\n\nOn August 30, 2015, just ahead of a presidential visit to Alaska, the Barack Obama administration announced the name *Denali* would be restored in line with the Alaska Geographic Board's designation.[10][29] U.S. Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell issued the order changing the name to Denali on August 28, 2015, effective immediately.[9] Jewell said the change had been \"a long time coming\".[30] The renaming of the mountain received praise from Alaska's senior U.S. senator, Lisa Murkowski (R-AK),[31] who had previously introduced legislation to accomplish the name change,[32] but it drew criticism from several politicians from President McKinley's home state of Ohio, such as Governor John Kasich, U.S. Senator Rob Portman, U.S. House Speaker John Boehner, and Representative Bob Gibbs, who described Obama's action as \"constitutional overreach\" because he said an act of Congress was required to rename the mountain.[33][34][35] The *Alaska Dispatch News* reported that the Secretary of the Interior has authority under federal law to change geographic names when the Board of Geographic Names does not act on a naming request within a \"reasonable\" period of time. Jewell told the *Alaska Dispatch News* that \"I think any of us would think that 40 years is an unreasonable amount of time.\"[36]\n\n\nIndigenous names for Denali can be found in seven different Alaskan languages. The names fall into two categories. To the south of the Alaska Range in the Dena'ina and Ahtna languages the mountain is known by names that are translated as \"big mountain\". To the north of the Alaska Range in the Lower Tanana, Koyukon, Upper Kuskokwim, Holikachuk, and Deg Xinag languages the mountain is known by names that are translated as \"the high one\",[37] \"the tall one\" (Koyukon, Lower and Middle Tanana, Upper Kuskokwim, Deg Xinag, and Holikachuk), or \"big mountain\" (Ahtna and Dena'ina).[38]\n\n\nAsked about the importance of the mountain and its name, Will Mayo, former president of the Tanana Chiefs Conference, an organization that represents 42 Athabaskan tribes in the Alaskan interior, said \"It's not one homogeneous belief structure around the mountain, but we all agree that we're all deeply gratified by the acknowledgment of the importance of Denali to Alaska's people.\"[39]\n\n\nThe following table lists the Alaskan Athabascan names for Denali.[38]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Literal meaning\n | Native language\n | Spelling in thelocal practical alphabet\n | Spelling in astandardized alphabet\n | IPA transcription\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 'The tall one'\n | Koyukon | Deenaalee | Diinaalii | /di\u02d0\u02c8n\u00e6li/ |\n| Lower Tanana | Deenadheet, Deenadhee | Diinaadhiit, Diinaadhii | /di\u02c8n\u00e6\u00f0id/ |\n| Middle Tanana | Diineezi | Diinaadhi | /di\u02c8n\u00e6\u00f0i/ |\n| Upper Kuskokwim | Denaze | Diinaazii | /di\u02c8n\u00e6zi/ |\n| Deg Xinag | Dengadh, Dengadhi | Dengadh, Dengadhe | /t\u0259\u02c8\u014ba\u00f0, t\u0259\u02c8\u014ba\u00f0\u0259/ |\n| Holikachuk | Denadhe | Diinaadhii | /di\u02d0\u02c8n\u00e6\u00f0i\u02d0/ |\n| 'Big mountain'\n | Ahtna | Dghelaay Ce'e, Deghilaay Ce'e | Dghelaay Ke'e, Deghilaay Ke'e | /d\u0281\u025b\u02c8l\u0254j \u02c8k\u025b\u0294\u025b/ |\n| Upper Inlet Dena'ina | Dghelay Ka'a | Dghelay Ka'a | /d\u0281\u0259\u02c8laj \u02c8ka\u0294a/ |\n| Lower Inlet Dena'ina | Dghili Ka'a | Dghili Ka'a | /d\u0281ili \u02c8ka\u0294a/ |\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![In a grayscale photograph, two men stand in front of a tent and snowy evergreen trees](image)Hudson Stuck and Harry Karstens, co-leaders of the first successful expedition of four to reach the summit of Denali in 1913, the other members of the expedition being Robert G. Tatum and Walter Harper\nThe Koyukon Athabaskans, living in the Yukon, Tanana and Kuskokwim basins, were the first Native Americans with access to the flanks of the mountain.[4] A British naval captain and explorer, George Vancouver, is the first European on record to have sighted Denali, when he noted \"distant stupendous mountains\" while surveying the Knik Arm of the Cook Inlet on May 6, 1794.[40] The Russian explorer Lavrenty Zagoskin explored the Tanana and Kuskokwim rivers in 1843 and 1844, and was likely the first European to sight the mountain from the other side.[41]\n\n\nWilliam Dickey, a New Hampshire-born resident of Seattle, Washington who had been digging for gold in the sands of the Susitna River, wrote, after his returning from Alaska, an account in the *New York Sun* that appeared on January 24, 1897.[42] His report drew attention with the sentence \"We have no doubt that this peak is the highest in North America, and estimate that it is over 20,000 feet (6,100\u00a0m) high.\" Until then, Mount Logan in Canada's Yukon Territory was believed to be the continent's highest point. Though later praised for his estimate, Dickey admitted that other prospector parties had also guessed the mountain to be over 20,000 feet (6,100\u00a0m).[43] These estimates were confirmed in 1898 by the surveyor Robert Muldrow, who measured its elevation as 20,300 feet (6,200\u00a0m).[44]\n\n\nOn November 5, 2012, the United States Mint released a twenty-five cent piece depicting Denali National Park. It is the fifteenth of the America the Beautiful Quarters series.

The party landed at Cook Inlet in late May, then traveled east, paralleling the Alaska Range, before reaching the slopes of Denali in early August. Camped on the flank of the mountain on August 3, Brooks noted later that while \"the ascent of Mount McKinley had never been part of our plans\", the party decided to delay one day so \"that we might actually set foot on the slopes of the mountain\". Setting off alone, with good weather, on August 4, Brooks aimed to reach a 10,000 feet (3,048\u00a0m) shoulder. At 7,500 feet (2,286\u00a0m), Brooks found his way blocked by sheer ice and, after leaving a small cairn as a marker, descended.[46] After the party's return, Brooks co-authored a \"Plan For Climbing Mt McKinley\", published in *National Geographic* magazine in January 1903, with fellow party-member and topographer D. L. Raeburn, in which they suggested that future attempts at the summit should approach from the north, not the south.[47] The report received substantial attention, and within a year, two climbing parties declared their intent to summit.[48]\n\n\nDuring the early summer of 1903, Judge James Wickersham, then of Eagle, Alaska, made the first recorded attempt to climb Denali, along with a party of four others. The group attempted to get as close to the mountain as possible via the Kantishna river by steamer, before offloading and following Chitsia Creek with a poling boat, mules and backpacks, a route suggested to them by Tanana Athabaskan people they met along the way. The party received further navigational assistance at Anotoktilon, an Athabaskan hunting camp, where residents gave the group detailed directions to reach the glaciers at the foot of Denali. On reaching the mountain, the mountaineers set up base camp on the lower portion of Peters Glacier. Aiming for the northwest buttress of Denali's north peak, they attempted to ascend directly; however, crevasses, ice fall and the lack of a clear passage caused them to turn and attempt to follow a spur via Jeffery Glacier where they believed they could see a way to the summit. After a dangerous ascent, at around 10,000 feet (3,048\u00a0m), Wickersham found that the route did not connect as it had appeared from below, instead discovering \"a tremendous precipice beyond which we cannot go. Our only line of further ascent would be to climb the vertical wall of the mountain at our left, and that is impossible.\" This wall, now known as the Wickersham Wall, juts 15,000 feet (4,572\u00a0m) upwards from the glacier to the north peak of Denali.[49] Because of the route's history of avalanche danger, it was not successfully climbed until 1963.[50]\n\n\nLater in the summer of 1903, Dr. Frederick Cook directed a team of five men on another attempt at the summit. Cook was already an experienced explorer and had been a party-member on successful arctic expeditions commanded both by Robert Peary and Roald Amundsen.[49][51] Yet he struggled to obtain funding for his own expedition, eventually organizing it \"on a shoestring budget\"[52] without any other experienced climbers.[51] The party navigated up the Cook inlet and followed the path of the 1902 Brooks party towards Denali. Cook approached the mountain via the Peters Glacier, as Wickersham had done; however, he was able to overcome the ice fall that had caused the previous group to turn up the spur towards the Wickersham Wall. Despite avoiding this obstacle, on August 31, having reached an elevation of about 10,900 feet (3,322\u00a0m) on the northwest buttress of the north peak, the party found they had reached a dead end and could make no further progress. On the descent, the group completely circumnavigated the mountain, the first climbing party to do so.[53] Although Cook's 1903 expedition did not reach the summit, he received acclaim for the accomplishment, a 1,000 miles (1,609\u00a0km) trek in which he not only circled the entire mountain but also found, on the descent, an accessible pass northeast of the Muldrow Glacier following the headwaters of the Toklat and Chulitna rivers.[49]\n\n\nIn 1906, Cook initiated another expedition to Denali with co-leader Herschel Parker, a Columbia University professor of electrical engineering with extensive mountaineering experience. Belmore Browne, an experienced climber and five other men comprised the rest of the group. Cook and Parker's group spent most of the summer season exploring the southern and southeastern approaches to the mountain, eventually reaching a high point on Tokositna glacier, 25 miles (40\u00a0km) from the summit.[53] During their explorations the party mapped out many of the tributaries and glaciers of the Susitna river along the mountain's south flank.[49] As the summer ended, the team retreated to the coast and began to disperse. In September 1906, Cook and a single party-member, horseman Robert Barrill, journeyed towards the summit again, in what Cook later described as \"a last desperate attempt\" in a telegram to his financial backers.[49] Cook and Barrill spent 12 days in total on the attempt, and claimed to have reached the summit via the Ruth Glacier.[52]\n\n\nUpon hearing Cook's claims, Parker and Browne were immediately suspicious. Browne later wrote that he knew Cook's claims were lies, just as \"any New Yorker would know that no man could walk from the Brooklyn Bridge to Grant's Tomb [a distance of eight miles] in ten minutes.\"[52] In May 1907, *Harper's Magazine* published Cook's account of the climb along with a photograph of what appeared to be Barrill standing on the summit. By 1909, Barrill had recanted at least part of his story about the climb, and others publicly questioned the account; however, Cook continued to assert his claim[54] The controversy continued for decades. In 1956, mountaineers Bradford Washburn and Walter Gonnason tried to settle the matter, with Gonnason attempting to follow Cook's purported route to the summit. Washburn noted inconsistencies between Cook's account of locations of glaciers and found a spot, at 5,400 feet (1,646\u00a0m) and 19 miles (31\u00a0km) southeast of the summit that appeared identical to the supposed summit image. Gonnason was not able to complete the climb, but because he was turned back by poor weather, felt that this did not definitely disprove Cook's story.[55] In 1998, historian Robert Bryce discovered an original and un-cropped version of the \"fake peak\" photograph of Barrill standing on the promontory. It showed a wider view of surrounding features, appearing to definitively discount Cook's claim.[56]\n\n\n\n![Several tents are pitched near the edge of a snow-covered cliff](image)High camp (17,200\u00a0ft or 5,200\u00a0m) of the West Buttress Route pioneered by Bradford Washburn, photographed in 2001\nGiven the skepticism concerning Cook's story, interest in claiming the first ascent remained. Miners and other Alaskans living in Kantishna and Fairbanks wanted the honors to go to local men. In 1909, four Alaska residents \u2013 Tom Lloyd, Peter Anderson, Billy Taylor, and Charles McGonagall \u2013 set out from Fairbanks, Alaska during late December with supplies and dogs that were in part paid for by bettors in a Fairbanks tavern. By March 1910, the men had established a base camp near one of the sites where the Brooks party had been and pressed on from the north via the Muldrow glacier. Unlike some previous expeditions, they discovered a pass, since named McGonagall Pass, which allowed them to bypass the Wickersham Wall and access the higher reaches of the mountain. At roughly 11,000 feet (3,353\u00a0m), Tom Lloyd, old and less physically fit than the others, stayed behind. According to their account, the remaining three men pioneered a route following Karstens Ridge around the Harper Icefall, then reached the upper basin before ascending to Pioneer Ridge. The three men carried a 14-foot-long (4.3\u00a0m) spruce pole. Around 19,000 feet (5,791\u00a0m), Charles McGonagall, older and having exhausted himself carrying the spruce pole, remained behind. On April 3, 1910, Billy Taylor and Peter Anderson scrambled the final few hundred feet to reach the north peak of Denali, at 19,470 feet (5,934\u00a0m) high, the shorter of the two peaks. The pair erected the pole near the top, with the hope that it would be visible from lower reaches to prove they had made it.[57]\n\n\nAfter the expedition, Tom Lloyd returned to Fairbanks, while the three others remained in Kantishna to mine. In Lloyd's recounting, all four men made it to the top of not only the north peak, but the higher south peak as well. When the remaining three men returned to town with conflicting accounts, the entire expedition's legitimacy was questioned.[58] Several years later, another climbing group would claim to have seen the spruce pole in the distance, supporting their north peak claim.[57] However, some continue to doubt they reached the summit. Outside of the single later climbing group, who were friendly with some of the Sourdough expedition men, no other group would ever see it. Jon Waterman, author of the book *Chasing Denali*, which explored the controversy, outlined several reasons to doubt the claim: There was never any photographic evidence. The four men climbed during the winter season, known for much more difficult conditions, along a route that has never been fully replicated. They were inexperienced climbers, ascending without any of the usual safety gear or any care for altitude sickness. They claimed to have ascended from 11,000 feet (3,353\u00a0m) to the top in less than 18 hours, unheard of at a time when siege-style alpinism was the norm.[59] Yet Waterman says \"these guys were men of the trail. They didn't care what anybody thought. They were just tough SOBs.\"[60] He noted that the men were largely unlettered and that some of the ensuing doubt was related to their lack of sophistication in dealing with the press and the contemporary climbing establishment.[59]\n\n\nIn 1912, the Parker-Browne expedition nearly reached the summit, turning back within just a few hundred yards/meters of it due to harsh weather. On July 7, the day after their descent, a 7.4-magnitude earthquake shattered the glacier they had ascended.[61][62][63]\n\n\nThe first ascent of the main summit of Denali came on June 7, 1913, by a party directed by Hudson Stuck and Harry Karstens, along with Walter Harper and Robert Tatum. Karstens relocated to Alaska in the gold rush of 1897, and in subsequent years became involved in a variety of endeavors beyond mining, including helping establish dog mushing routes to deliver mail across vast swathes of territory and supporting expeditions led by naturalist Charles Sheldon near the base of Denali.[64] Stuck was an English-born Episcopal priest who came to Alaska by chance. He became acclimated to the often harsh Alaskan environment because of his many travels between far-flung outposts within his district, climbing mountains as a hobby.[65] At 21 years old, Harper was already known as a skilled and strong outdoorsman, the Alaska-born son of a Koyukon-Athabascan mother and Irish gold prospector father.[66][67] Tatum, also 21 years old, was a theology student working at a Tanana mission, and the least experienced of the team. His primary responsibility on the trip was as a cook.[68]\n\n\nThe team approached the peak from the north via the Muldrow glacier and McGonagall pass. While ferrying loads up to a camp at around 10,800 feet (3,292\u00a0m), they suffered a setback when a stray match accidentally set fire to some supplies, including several tents. The prior year's earthquake had left what had previously been described by the Parker-Browne expedition as a gentle slope ascended in no more than three days as a dangerous, ice-strewn morass on a knife-edged ridge (later named Karstens ridge). It would take the team three weeks to cover the same ground, as Karstens and Harper laboriously cut steps into the ice. On May 30, the team, with the help of some good weather, ascended to a new high camp, situated at 17,500 feet (5,334\u00a0m) in the Grand Basin between the north and south peaks. On June 7, the team made the summit attempt. Temperatures were below \u221220\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221229\u00a0\u00b0C) at times. Every man, and particularly Stuck, suffered from altitude sickness. By midday, Harper became the first climber to reach the summit, followed seconds later by Tatum and Karstens. Stuck arrived last, falling unconscious on the summit.[69]\n\n\nUsing the mountain's contemporary name, Tatum later commented, \"The view from the top of Mount McKinley is like looking out the windows of Heaven!\"[70] During the climb, Stuck spotted, via binoculars, the presence of a large pole near the North Summit; this report confirmed the Sourdough ascent, and it is widely believed presently that the Sourdoughs did succeed on the North Summit. However, the pole was never seen before or since, so there is still some doubt. Stuck also discovered that the Parker-Browne party were only about 200 feet (61\u00a0m) of elevation short of the true summit when they turned back. Stuck and Karstens' team achieved the uncontroversial first ascent of Denali's south peak; however, the news was met with muted interest by the wider climbing community. *Appalachia Journal*, then the official journal of the American Alpine Club, published a small notice of the accomplishment a year later.[65]\n\n\nThe mountain is climbed regularly nowadays. In 2003, around 58% of climbers reached the top. But by that time, the mountain had claimed the lives of nearly 100 mountaineers.[71] The vast majority of climbers use the West Buttress Route, pioneered in 1951 by Bradford Washburn,[11] after an extensive aerial photographic analysis of the mountain. Climbers typically take two to four weeks to ascend Denali. It is one of the Seven Summits; summiting all of them is a challenge for mountaineers.\n\n\nOn August 4, 2018, five people died in the K2 Aviation de Havilland Beaver (DHC-2) crash near Denali.\n\n\n\n### Accidents[edit]\n\n\nFrom 1947 to 2018 in the United States \"2,799 people were reported to be involved in mountaineering accidents\"[72] and 11% of these accidents occurred on Denali.[72] Of these 2,799 accidents, 43% resulted in death and 8% of these deaths occurred on Denali.[72]\n\n\n\n### Timeline[edit]\n\n\n![An aerial view of Denali; an airplane wing is visible in the lower-left corner](image)Denali's West Buttress (lower left to upper right), August 2010\n![A rotating 3-D computer image of the mountain](image)A three-dimensional representation of the mountain created with topographic data\n* 1896\u20131902: Surveys by Robert Muldrow, George Eldridge, Alfred Brooks.[73]\n* 1913: First ascent, by Hudson Stuck, Harry Karstens, Walter Harper, and Robert Tatum via the Muldrow Glacier route.[74]\n* 1932: Second ascent, by Alfred Lindley, Harry Liek, Grant Pearson, Erling Strom.

The United States National Geodetic Survey later determined the summit elevation to be 20,310\u00a0ft (6,190 metres).[1]\n* 2019: On June 20, Karl Egloff (Swiss-Ecuadorian) set new speed records for the ascent (7h 40m) and round-trip (11h 44m), starting and returning to a base camp at 7,200\u00a0ft (2,200\u00a0m) on the Kahiltna Glacier.[98][99]\n\n\n## Weather station[edit]\n\n\n![Denali seen through a green field](image)The east side viewed from Denali National Park and Preserve, which surrounds the mountain\nThe Japan Alpine Club installed a meteorological station on a ridge near the summit of Denali at an elevation of 18,733 feet (5,710\u00a0m) in 1990.[100] In 1998, this weather station was donated to the International Arctic Research Center at the University of Alaska Fairbanks.[100] In June 2002, a weather station was placed at the 19,000-foot (5,800\u00a0m) level. This weather station was designed to transmit data in real-time for use by the climbing public and the science community. Since its establishment, annual upgrades to the equipment have been performed with instrumentation custom built for the extreme weather and altitude conditions. This weather station is the third-highest weather station in the world.[101]\n\n\nThe weather station recorded a temperature of \u221275.5\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221259.7\u00a0\u00b0C) on December 1, 2003. On the previous day of November 30, 2003, a temperature of \u221274.4\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221259.1\u00a0\u00b0C) combined with a wind speed of 18.4 miles per hour (29.6\u00a0km/h) to produce a North American record windchill of \u2212118.1\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221283.4\u00a0\u00b0C).\n\n\nEven in July, this weather station has recorded temperatures as low as \u221222.9\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221230.5\u00a0\u00b0C) and windchills as low as \u221259.2\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221250.7\u00a0\u00b0C).\n\n\n\n### Historical record[edit]\n\n\nAccording to the National Park Service, in 1932 the Liek-Lindley expedition recovered a self-recording minimum thermometer left near Browne's Tower, at about 15,000 feet (4,600\u00a0m), on Denali by the Stuck-Karstens party in 1913. The spirit thermometer was calibrated down to \u221295\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221271\u00a0\u00b0C), and the lowest recorded temperature was below that point. Harry J. Liek took the thermometer back to Washington, D.C. where it was tested by the United States Weather Bureau and found to be accurate. The lowest temperature that it had recorded was found to be approximately \u2212100\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221273\u00a0\u00b0C).[102] Another thermometer was placed at the 15,000-foot (4,600\u00a0m) level by the U.S. Army Natick Laboratory, and was there from 1950 to 1969. The coldest temperature recorded during that period was also \u2212100\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221273\u00a0\u00b0C).[103]\n\n\n\n## Subpeaks and nearby mountains[edit]\n\n\n![The top of Denali is shrouded in clouds](image)Denali, here shrouded in clouds, is large enough to create its own localized weather\nBesides the North Summit mentioned above, other features on the massif which are sometimes included as separate peaks are:\n\n\n\n* South Buttress, 15,885 feet (4,842\u00a0m); mean prominence: 335 feet (102\u00a0m)\n* East Buttress high point, 14,730 feet (4,490\u00a0m); mean prominence: 380 feet (120\u00a0m)\n* East Buttress, most topographically prominent point, 14,650 feet (4,470\u00a0m); mean prominence: 600 feet (180\u00a0m)\n* Browne Tower, 14,530 feet (4,430\u00a0m); mean prominence: 75 feet (23\u00a0m)\n\n\nNearby peaks include:\n\n\n\n* Mount Crosson\n* Mount Foraker\n* Mount Silverthrone\n* Mount Hunter\n* Mount Huntington\n* Mount Dickey\n* The Moose's Tooth\n\n\n## Taxonomic honors[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ice Sheets on Denali\n* *denaliensis*\n\t+ *Ceratozetella denaliensis* (formerly *Cyrtozetes denaliensis* Behan-Pelletier, 1985) is a species of moss mite in the family Mycobatidae sv:Ceratozetella denaliensis\n\t+ *Magnoavipes denaliensis* Fiorillo et al., 2011 (literally \"bird with large feet found in Denali\") is a *Magnoavipes* ichnospecies of bird footprint from the Upper Cretaceous of Alaska and was a large heron-like bird (as larger than a sandhill crane) with three toes and toe pads. pt:Magnoavipes denaliensis\n* *denali*\n\t+ *Cosberella denali\u00a0[sv]* (Fjellberg, 1985) is a springtail.\n\t+ *Proclossiana aphirape denali* Klots, 1940 is a *Boloria* butterfly species of the subfamily Heliconiinae of family Nymphalidae.\n\t+ *Symplecta denali\u00a0[sv]* (Alexander, 1955) is a species of crane fly in the family Limoniidae.\n\t+ *Tipula denali\u00a0[sv]* Alexander, 1969 is a species of crane fly in the family Tipulidae.\n* *denalii*\n\t+ *Erigeron denalii* A.

The mountain is about 90 miles (140\u00a0km) east of El Paso and about 50 miles (80\u00a0km) southwest of Carlsbad, New Mexico. The peak rises more than 3,000 feet (910\u00a0m) above the arid floor of the Chihuahuan Desert.\n\n\n\n\n## Trail and summit[edit]\n\n\nThe peak can be climbed at any time of the year by a maintained stony trail (4.25 miles or 6.8 kilometers each way) with a 3,000-foot (910\u00a0m) elevation gain.[5] The trail is part of the network of hiking trails in the surrounding national park.\n\n\nA stainless steel pyramid marks the summit. It was erected by American Airlines in 1958 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Butterfield Overland Mail, a stagecoach route that passed south of the mountain. One side of the pyramid has the American Airlines logo. The second side displays a U.S. Postal Service tribute to the Pony Express Riders of the Butterfield Stage. The third side displays a compass with the logo of the Boy Scouts of America. \n\n\n\n![](image)\nGuadalupe Peak from Hunter Peak\n\n\nA hiker was found dead on New Year's Eve 2022, as there were wind gusts of more than 50 miles (80\u00a0km) per hour and wind chills were \"well below freezing\" that day, according to the release.\n\n\n\"At nearly 9,000 feet (2,700\u00a0m) above sea level, Guadalupe Peak is a mountain environment with associated risks not found elsewhere in Texas,\" the park said, noting that the hike is a \"very strenuous, 8.4-mile (13.5\u00a0km) round trip hike with a 3,000-foot (910\u00a0m) elevation gain\" to the highest point in the state.\n\n\n\n## Gallery[edit]\n\n\n* ![View west from top of peak.](image)\n\nView west from top of peak.\n* ![Salt Flats from summit.](image)\n\nSalt Flats from summit.\n* ![Guadalupe Mountains in sunset.](image)\n\nGuadalupe Mountains in sunset.\n* ![Hiking trail up the peak.](image)\n\nHiking trail up the peak.\n* ![High elevation (8,100 feet (2,500\u00a0m)) campground near summit.](image)\n\nHigh elevation (8,100 feet (2,500\u00a0m)) campground near summit.\n* ![Culberson County, Texas, from the summit.](image)\n\nCulberson County, Texas, from the summit.\n* ![The pyramid at the summit.](image)\n\nThe pyramid at the summit.\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![map](image)North America portal\n* ![flag](image)United States portal\n* ![flag](image)Texas portal\n* ![icon](image)Mountains portal\n\n\n* List of mountain peaks of North America\n\t+ List of mountain peaks of the United States\n\t\t- List of U.S. states by elevation\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** \"El Capitan\". *NGS Data Sheet*.

The topographic elevation of a summit measures the height of the summit above a geodetic sea level.[b][c] The first table below ranks the 50 highest major summits of California by elevation.\n2. The topographic prominence of a summit is a measure of how high the summit rises above its surroundings.[d][c] The second table below ranks the 50 most prominent summits of California.\n3. The topographic isolation (or radius of dominance) of a summit measures how far the summit lies from its nearest point of equal elevation.[e] The third table below ranks the 50 most isolated major summits of California.\n\n\n\n## Highest major summits[edit]\n\n\n**Map this section's coordinates using** OpenStreetMap\n**Download coordinates as:**\n\n\n\n* KML\n* GPX (all coordinates)\n* GPX (primary coordinates)\n* GPX (secondary coordinates)\n\nOf the highest major summits of California, 16 peaks exceed 4000 meters (13,123 feet) elevation and 46 peaks exceed 3000 meters (9843 feet) elevation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 50 highest summits of California with at least 500\u00a0meters of topographic\u00a0prominence  \n  \n\n| Rank | Mountain peak | Mountain range | Elevation | Prominence | Isolation | Location |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | Mount Whitney[1][2][3][4][f][g] | Sierra Nevada | 14,505\u00a0ft4421\u00a0m | 10,080\u00a0ft3072\u00a0m | 1,646\u00a0mi2,649\u00a0km\n | 36\u00b034\u203243\u2033N 118\u00b017\u203231\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff36.5786\u00b0N 118.2920\u00b0W\ufeff / 36.5786;

All summits in this article have at least 500\u00a0meters of topographic prominence. An ultra-prominent summit is a summit with at least 1500 meters (4921 feet) of topographic prominence.\n2. **^** All elevations in this article include an elevation adjustment from the National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 (NGVD 29) to the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD 88). For further information, please see this United States National Geodetic Survey note.\n3. ^ ***a*** ***b*** If the elevation or prominence of a summit is calculated as a range of values, the arithmetic mean is shown.\n4. **^** The topographic prominence of a summit is the topographic elevation difference between the summit and its highest or key col to a higher summit. The summit may be near its key col or quite far away. The key col for Denali in Alaska is the Isthmus of Rivas in Nicaragua, 7642 kilometers (4749 miles) away.\n5. **^** The topographic isolation of a summit is the great-circle distance to its nearest point of equal elevation.\n6. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** The summit of Mount Whitney is the highest point of the Sierra Nevada, the State of California, and the contiguous United States.\n7. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Mount Whitney is the southernmost and easternmost summit of its elevation in United States.\n8. **^** The elevation of Mount Williamson includes an adjustment of +1.807\u00a0m

Granite Peak is 10 miles (16\u00a0km) north of the Wyoming border and 45 miles (72\u00a0km) southwest of Columbus, Montana.\n\n\nGranite Peak is often considered the second most difficult state high point to climb after Denali in Alaska, due to technical climbing, poor weather, and route finding.[4][5] Granite Peak's first ascent was made by Elers Koch, James C. Whitham, and R.T. Ferguson on August 29, 1923, after several failed attempts by others. It was the last of the state high points to be climbed.[5] Today, climbers typically spend two or three days ascending the peak, stopping over on the Froze-to-Death Plateau, although some climbers choose to ascend the peak in a single day. Another route that has gained popularity in recent years is the Southwest Couloir route, a non-technical route from the south starting near Cooke City; climbers generally take two days to complete it.\n\n\n\n\n## Climate[edit]\n\n\n| Climate data for Granite Peak 45.1650 N, 109.8158 W, Elevation: 12,192\u00a0ft (3,716\u00a0m) (1991\u20132020 normals)\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Mean daily maximum \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n | 17.8(\u22127.9)\n | 16.9(\u22128.4)\n | 21.7(\u22125.7)\n | 27.2(\u22122.7)\n | 36.5(2.5)\n | 46.3(7.9)\n | 56.6(13.7)\n | 56.0(13.3)\n | 47.1(8.4)\n | 34.2(1.2)\n | 23.0(\u22125.0)\n | 17.0(\u22128.3)\n | 33.4(0.8)\n |\n| Daily mean \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n | 8.5(\u221213.1)\n | 6.8(\u221214.0)\n | 10.9(\u221211.7)\n | 15.6(\u22129.1)\n | 24.4(\u22124.2)\n | 33.5(0.8)\n | 42.5(5.8)\n | 42.0(5.6)\n | 33.9(1.1)\n | 22.8(\u22125.1)\n | 13.8(\u221210.1)\n | 8.1(\u221213.3)\n | 21.9(\u22125.6)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n | \u22120.8(\u221218.2)\n | \u22123.4(\u221219.7)\n | 0.2(\u221217.7)\n | 4.0(\u221215.6)\n | 12.2(\u221211.0)\n | 20.7(\u22126.3)\n | 28.4(\u22122.0)\n | 27.9(\u22122.3)\n | 20.7(\u22126.3)\n | 11.5(\u221211.4)\n | 4.6(\u221215.2)\n | \u22120.9(\u221218.3)\n | 10.4(\u221212.0)\n |\n| Average precipitation inches (mm)\n | 6.87(174)\n | 6.61(168)\n | 6.59(167)\n | 6.24(158)\n | 5.44(138)\n | 4.55(116)\n | 3.23(82)\n | 2.68(68)\n | 2.88(73)\n | 4.53(115)\n | 6.52(166)\n | 7.50(191)\n | 63.64(1,616)\n |\n| Source: PRISM Climate Group[6] |\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n![](image)Froze-to-Death Plateau, on the slope leading to the summit\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image) Geography portal\n* ![icon](image) Mountains portal\n* List of mountains in Montana\n* List of U.S. states by elevation\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** \"Granite Peak\". *NGS Data Sheet*.

It is located northeast of Taos and south of Red River in the northern part of the state, and just 2 miles (3.2\u00a0km) southeast of the ski slopes of Taos Ski Valley. It lies in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, the southernmost subrange of the Rocky Mountains. The peak's elevation is 13,167 feet (4,013\u00a0m).\n\n\nFormerly named Taos Peak, after the nearby town of Taos, New Mexico, it was renamed Wheeler Peak in 1950.[3] A plaque at the summit states that the mountain was:\n\n\n\n\n> Named in honor of Major George Montague Wheeler (1832\u20131909) who for ten years led a party of surveyors and naturalists collecting geologic, biologic, planimetric and topographic data in New Mexico and six other southwestern states.\n> \n> \n\n\n\n## Nearby peaks and features[edit]\n\n\nJust north of Wheeler Peak is Mount Walter. At 13,141 feet (4,005\u00a0m) it is the second highest named summit in New Mexico, but it is not usually considered an independent peak as it has only about 53 feet (16\u00a0m) of topographic prominence. It is sometimes mistaken for Wheeler Peak, since it is along the standard route to Wheeler. Lake Fork Peak at 12,881 feet (3,926\u00a0m) lies just across Williams Lake and to the west of Wheeler Mountain.\n\n\nTaos Ski Valley lies to the northwest of Wheeler Peak, while both the town of Taos and Taos Pueblo are about 15 miles (24\u00a0km) to the southwest. \n\n\nWheeler Peak is the focus of the 19,661-acre (79.57\u00a0km2) Wheeler Peak Wilderness area in the Carson National Forest. Much of the mountain area just south of the peak is on Taos Pueblo land. Some 48,000 acres (190\u00a0km2) was returned to the pueblo from the Carson National Forest in 1970[4]\nand another 764 acres (3.09\u00a0km2) in 1996.[5]\n\n\n\n## Climate[edit]\n\n\n| Climate data for Wheeler Peak 36.5619 N, 105.4181 W, Elevation: 12,789\u00a0ft (3,898\u00a0m) (1991\u20132020 normals)\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Mean daily maximum \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n | 27.1(\u22122.7)\n | 27.3(\u22122.6)\n | 32.3(0.2)\n | 36.1(2.3)\n | 45.3(7.4)\n | 56.5(13.6)\n | 59.9(15.5)\n | 57.7(14.3)\n | 51.7(10.9)\n | 41.8(5.4)\n | 34.0(1.1)\n | 27.4(\u22122.6)\n | 41.4(5.2)\n |\n| Daily mean \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n | 15.6(\u22129.1)\n | 15.5(\u22129.2)\n | 20.1(\u22126.6)\n | 24.4(\u22124.2)\n | 33.3(0.7)\n | 43.4(6.3)\n | 47.4(8.6)\n | 45.9(7.7)\n | 40.3(4.6)\n | 31.0(\u22120.6)\n | 23.0(\u22125.0)\n | 16.3(\u22128.7)\n | 29.7(\u22121.3)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n | 4.2(\u221215.4)\n | 3.8(\u221215.7)\n | 7.9(\u221213.4)\n | 12.7(\u221210.7)\n | 21.2(\u22126.0)\n | 30.4(\u22120.9)\n | 34.8(1.6)\n | 34.0(1.1)\n | 28.8(\u22121.8)\n | 20.2(\u22126.6)\n | 11.9(\u221211.2)\n | 5.2(\u221214.9)\n | 17.9(\u22127.8)\n |\n| Average precipitation inches (mm)\n | 3.44(87)\n | 3.23(82)\n | 4.41(112)\n | 4.13(105)\n | 3.00(76)\n | 1.34(34)\n | 3.49(89)\n | 4.10(104)\n | 3.18(81)\n | 3.08(78)\n | 3.73(95)\n | 3.69(94)\n | 40.82(1,037)\n |\n| Source: PRISM Climate Group[6] |\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n## Climbing[edit]\n\n\nThe standard route on Wheeler Peak is along the north ridge. The route starts at the parking lot for Taos Ski Valley, and proceeds east along an old road to a broad saddle at Bull-of-the-Woods Meadow. It then turns south and winds its way among minor peaks and small valleys to gain Wheeler Peak from the north, going over the summit of Mount Walter along the way. This is a practical route, even in winter, due to low (but nonzero) avalanche exposure.\n\n\nAn alternate route is to hike south from Taos Ski Valley to Williams Lake, then take a newly constructed switchback trail to the top. This trail was completed in 2011 by a Forest Service trail crew from the Gallatin National Forest, 8 people working 12 hours per day, building 4 miles of new trail with hand tools to the top in 14 days. \n\n\nAnother alternate route is to begin from the nearby ski resort of Red River. From the town of Red River drive 6.4 miles south on NM 578, then 1.3 miles on FR 58 to the trailhead parking area. From the parking area Wheeler peak is about 7 miles on Forest Trail 91. This route passes two alpine lakes, Lost Lake and Horseshoe Lake.\n\n\nWheeler Peak has a summit register as do many major western peaks.\n\n\n\n![](image)\nPanorama from Wheeler Peak\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Mountains portal\n\n\n* List of mountain peaks of North America\n\t+ List of mountain peaks of the United States\n\t\t- List of U.S. states by elevation\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Wheeler\". *NGS Data Sheet*.
