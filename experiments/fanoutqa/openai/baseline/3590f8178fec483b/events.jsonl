On 7 March, two weeks after scoring four goals in a league fixture against Valencia, he scored five times in a Champions League last 16-round match against Bayer Leverkusen, an unprecedented achievement in the history of the competition.[126][127] In addition to being the joint top assist provider with five assists, this feat made him top scorer with 14 goals, tying José Altafini's record from the 1962–63 season, as well as becoming only the second player after Gerd Müller to be top scorer in four campaigns.[128][129] Two weeks later, on 20 March, Messi became the top goalscorer in Barcelona's history at 24 years old, overtaking the 57-year record of César Rodríguez's 232 goals with a hat-trick against Granada.[130]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAfter a year at Barcelona's youth academy, La Masia, Messi was finally enrolled in the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) in February 2002. Now playing in all competitions, he befriended his teammates, among whom were Cesc Fàbregas and Gerard Piqué.[24] After completing his growth hormone treatment aged 14,[25] Messi became an integral part of the \"Baby Dream Team\", Barcelona's greatest-ever youth side. During his first full season (2002–03), he was top scorer with 36 goals in 30 games for the *Cadetes* A, who won an unprecedented treble of the league and both the Spanish and Catalan cups.[24][26] The Copa Catalunya final, a 4–1 victory over Espanyol, became known in club lore as the *partido de la máscara*, the final of the mask. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nwith Messi scoring Barcelona's only goal in that game.[309] On 15 March, Messi scored two goals in a 4–1 win against Huesca, and became the first player in history to score at least 20 goals in 13 consecutive seasons in the top five European leagues.[310] On 21 March, he surpassed Xavi's record to reach a club record of 768 appearances, in which he also scored a brace in a 6–1 away win against Real Sociedad.[311]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n84. **^** Jackson, Jamie (12 January 2009). \"Ronaldo Adds Fifa World Player of the Year to List of Accolades\". *The Guardian*.

A turning point came on 11 January during a 3–1 victory over Atlético Madrid, the first time Barça's attacking trident of Messi, Luis Suárez and Neymar, dubbed \"MSN\", each scored in a match, marking the beginning of a highly successful run.[172][173] After five years of playing in the centre of the pitch, Messi had returned to his old position on the right wing late the previous year, by his own suggestion according to Suárez, their striker.[173][174] From there, he regained his best form, while Suárez and Neymar ended the team's attacking dependency on their star player.[175][176] With 58 goals from Messi, the trio scored a total of 122 goals in all competitions that season, a record in Spanish football.[177]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n99. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Lowe, Sid (17 May 2010). \"La Liga Title the Least Barcelona Deserve as Madrid Again Finish Empty Handed\". *The Guardian*.

French winger Ludovic Giuly explained how Messi caught the eye in a training session with Frank Rijkaard's first team: \"He destroyed us all... They were kicking him all over the place to avoid being ridiculed by this kid, he just got up and kept on playing. He would dribble past four players and score a goal. Even the team's starting centre-backs were nervous. He was an alien.\"[34]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHe set up his side's first goal and scored twice to end the match in an emphatic 6–2 victory, the team's greatest-ever score at Real Madrid's Santiago Bernabéu Stadium.[87][88] Returning to the wing, he played his first final since breaking into the first team on 13 May, scoring once and assisting a second goal as Barcelona defeated Athletic Bilbao 4–1 to win the Copa del Rey.[89] With 23 league goals from Messi that season, Barcelona became La Liga champions three days later and achieved its fifth double.[85][90]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n191. **^** Gonzalez, Roger (27 August 2015). \"Messi Beats Ronaldo for 2014–15 UEFA Best Player in Europe Award\". *CBS Sports*.

First team director Charly Rexach immediately wanted to sign him, but the board of directors hesitated; at the time it was highly unusual for European clubs to sign foreign players of such a young age. On 14 December, an ultimatum was issued for Barcelona to prove their commitment, and Rexach, with no other paper at hand, offered a contract on a paper napkin.[19][22] In February 2001, the family relocated to Barcelona, where they moved into an apartment near the club's stadium, Camp Nou. During his first year in Spain, Messi rarely played with the *Infantiles* due to a transfer conflict with Newell's; as a foreigner, he could only be fielded in friendlies and the Catalan league. Without football, he struggled to integrate into the team; already reserved by nature, he was so quiet that his teammates initially believed he was mute. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDespite Messi's individual form, Barcelona's four-year cycle of success under Guardiola – one of the greatest eras in the club's history – drew to an end.[131] Although Barcelona won the Copa del Rey against Athletic Bilbao on 25 May, its 14th title of that period, the team lost the league to Real Madrid and was eliminated in the Champions League semi-finals by the eventual champions, Chelsea, with Messi sending a crucial second-leg penalty kick against the crossbar.[132][133] In Barça's last home league match on 5 May, against Espanyol, Messi scored all four goals before approaching the bench to embrace Guardiola, who had announced his resignation as manager.[134] He finished the season as league top scorer in Spain and Europe for a second time, with 50 goals, a La Liga record, while his 73 goals in all competitions surpassed Gerd Müller's 67 goals in the 1972–73 Bundesliga season, making him the single-season top scorer in the history of European club football.[135][136]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 4 February 2017, Messi scored his 27th free-kick for Barcelona in a 3–0 home win over Athletic Bilbao in the league, overtaking Koeman as the club's all-time top-scorer from free-kicks.[219] On 23 April, Messi scored twice in a 3–2 away win over Real Madrid. His game-winning goal in stoppage time was his 500th for Barcelona.[220] His memorable celebration saw him taking off his Barcelona shirt and holding it up to incensed Real Madrid fans – with his name and number facing the crowd.[221] On 27 May, Messi scored a goal and set up another for Paco Alcácer in the 2017 Copa del Rey final, helping Barcelona to a 3–1 victory over Alavés, and was named Man of the Match.[222] In total, Messi finished the 2016–17 season with 54 goals, while his 37 goals in La Liga saw him claim both the Pichichi and European Golden Boot Awards for the fourth time in his career.[223]\n\n\n\n#### 2017–18: domestic double and a record fifth Golden Boot[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs the season's Champions League top scorer with nine goals, the youngest in the tournament's history,[91] Messi scored two goals and assisted two more to ensure a 4–0 quarter-final victory over Bayern Munich.[87] He returned as a false nine during the final on 27 May in Rome against Manchester United. Barcelona were crowned champions of Europe by winning the match 2–0, the second goal coming from a Messi header over goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar. Barcelona thus achieved the first treble in the history of Spanish football.[92] This success was reflected in a new contract, signed on 18 September, which committed Messi to the club through 2016 with a new buyout clause of €250 million, while his salary increased to €12 million.[81]\n\n\n\n#### 2009–10: first Ballon d'Or[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nStatistically, his contribution of goals, shots, and passes had dropped significantly compared to previous seasons.[160][161] He still managed to break two longstanding records in a span of seven days: a hat-trick on 16 March against Osasuna saw him overtake Paulino Alcántara's 369 goals to become Barcelona's top goalscorer in all competitions including friendlies, while another hat-trick against Real Madrid on 23 March made him the all-time top scorer in *El Clásico*, ahead of the 18 goals scored by former Real Madrid player Alfredo Di Stéfano.[160][162] Messi finished the campaign with his worst output in five seasons, though he still managed to score 41 goals in all competitions.[161][163] For the first time in five years, Barcelona ended the season without a major trophy; they were defeated in the Copa del Rey final by Real Madrid and lost the league in the last game to Atlético Madrid, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAs Messi developed into a combination of a number 8 (a creator), a 9 (scorer), and a 10 (assistant),[116] he scored an unprecedented 73 goals and provided 29 assists in all club competitions during the 2011–12 season, producing a hat-trick or more on 10 occasions.[117][118][119] He began the campaign by helping Barcelona win both the Spanish and European Super Cups; in the Supercopa de España, he scored three times to achieve a 5–4 aggregate victory over Real Madrid, overtaking Raúl as the competition's all-time top scorer with eight goals.[120][121] At the close of the year, on 18 December, he scored twice in the FIFA Club World Cup final, a 4–0 victory over Santos, earning the Golden Ball as the best player of the tournament, as he had done two years previously.[122] For his efforts in 2011, he again received the FIFA Ballon d'Or, becoming only the fourth player in history to win the Ballon d'Or three times, after Johan Cruyff, Michel Platini, and Marco van Basten.[123] Additionally, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n42. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Lionel Andrés Messi Cuccittini: Matches 2003–04\".

On 7 March, two weeks after scoring four goals in a league fixture against Valencia, he scored five times in a Champions League last 16-round match against Bayer Leverkusen, an unprecedented achievement in the history of the competition.[126][127] In addition to being the joint top assist provider with five assists, this feat made him top scorer with 14 goals, tying José Altafini's record from the 1962–63 season, as well as becoming only the second player after Gerd Müller to be top scorer in four campaigns.[128][129] Two weeks later, on 20 March, Messi became the top goalscorer in Barcelona's history at 24 years old, overtaking the 57-year record of César Rodríguez's 232 goals with a hat-trick against Granada.[130]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAfter a year at Barcelona's youth academy, La Masia, Messi was finally enrolled in the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) in February 2002. Now playing in all competitions, he befriended his teammates, among whom were Cesc Fàbregas and Gerard Piqué.[24] After completing his growth hormone treatment aged 14,[25] Messi became an integral part of the \"Baby Dream Team\", Barcelona's greatest-ever youth side. During his first full season (2002–03), he was top scorer with 36 goals in 30 games for the *Cadetes* A, who won an unprecedented treble of the league and both the Spanish and Catalan cups.[24][26] The Copa Catalunya final, a 4–1 victory over Espanyol, became known in club lore as the *partido de la máscara*, the final of the mask. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nwith Messi scoring Barcelona's only goal in that game.[309] On 15 March, Messi scored two goals in a 4–1 win against Huesca, and became the first player in history to score at least 20 goals in 13 consecutive seasons in the top five European leagues.[310] On 21 March, he surpassed Xavi's record to reach a club record of 768 appearances, in which he also scored a brace in a 6–1 away win against Real Sociedad.[311]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n84. **^** Jackson, Jamie (12 January 2009). \"Ronaldo Adds Fifa World Player of the Year to List of Accolades\". *The Guardian*.

French winger Ludovic Giuly explained how Messi caught the eye in a training session with Frank Rijkaard's first team: \"He destroyed us all... They were kicking him all over the place to avoid being ridiculed by this kid, he just got up and kept on playing. He would dribble past four players and score a goal. Even the team's starting centre-backs were nervous. He was an alien.\"[34]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHe set up his side's first goal and scored twice to end the match in an emphatic 6–2 victory, the team's greatest-ever score at Real Madrid's Santiago Bernabéu Stadium.[87][88] Returning to the wing, he played his first final since breaking into the first team on 13 May, scoring once and assisting a second goal as Barcelona defeated Athletic Bilbao 4–1 to win the Copa del Rey.[89] With 23 league goals from Messi that season, Barcelona became La Liga champions three days later and achieved its fifth double.[85][90]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n191. **^** Gonzalez, Roger (27 August 2015). \"Messi Beats Ronaldo for 2014–15 UEFA Best Player in Europe Award\". *CBS Sports*.

First team director Charly Rexach immediately wanted to sign him, but the board of directors hesitated; at the time it was highly unusual for European clubs to sign foreign players of such a young age. On 14 December, an ultimatum was issued for Barcelona to prove their commitment, and Rexach, with no other paper at hand, offered a contract on a paper napkin.[19][22] In February 2001, the family relocated to Barcelona, where they moved into an apartment near the club's stadium, Camp Nou. During his first year in Spain, Messi rarely played with the *Infantiles* due to a transfer conflict with Newell's; as a foreigner, he could only be fielded in friendlies and the Catalan league. Without football, he struggled to integrate into the team; already reserved by nature, he was so quiet that his teammates initially believed he was mute. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDespite Messi's individual form, Barcelona's four-year cycle of success under Guardiola – one of the greatest eras in the club's history – drew to an end.[131] Although Barcelona won the Copa del Rey against Athletic Bilbao on 25 May, its 14th title of that period, the team lost the league to Real Madrid and was eliminated in the Champions League semi-finals by the eventual champions, Chelsea, with Messi sending a crucial second-leg penalty kick against the crossbar.[132][133] In Barça's last home league match on 5 May, against Espanyol, Messi scored all four goals before approaching the bench to embrace Guardiola, who had announced his resignation as manager.[134] He finished the season as league top scorer in Spain and Europe for a second time, with 50 goals, a La Liga record, while his 73 goals in all competitions surpassed Gerd Müller's 67 goals in the 1972–73 Bundesliga season, making him the single-season top scorer in the history of European club football.[135][136]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 4 February 2017, Messi scored his 27th free-kick for Barcelona in a 3–0 home win over Athletic Bilbao in the league, overtaking Koeman as the club's all-time top-scorer from free-kicks.[219] On 23 April, Messi scored twice in a 3–2 away win over Real Madrid. His game-winning goal in stoppage time was his 500th for Barcelona.[220] His memorable celebration saw him taking off his Barcelona shirt and holding it up to incensed Real Madrid fans – with his name and number facing the crowd.[221] On 27 May, Messi scored a goal and set up another for Paco Alcácer in the 2017 Copa del Rey final, helping Barcelona to a 3–1 victory over Alavés, and was named Man of the Match.[222] In total, Messi finished the 2016–17 season with 54 goals, while his 37 goals in La Liga saw him claim both the Pichichi and European Golden Boot Awards for the fourth time in his career.[223]\n\n\n\n#### 2017–18: domestic double and a record fifth Golden Boot[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs the season's Champions League top scorer with nine goals, the youngest in the tournament's history,[91] Messi scored two goals and assisted two more to ensure a 4–0 quarter-final victory over Bayern Munich.[87] He returned as a false nine during the final on 27 May in Rome against Manchester United. Barcelona were crowned champions of Europe by winning the match 2–0, the second goal coming from a Messi header over goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar. Barcelona thus achieved the first treble in the history of Spanish football.[92] This success was reflected in a new contract, signed on 18 September, which committed Messi to the club through 2016 with a new buyout clause of €250 million, while his salary increased to €12 million.[81]\n\n\n\n#### 2009–10: first Ballon d'Or[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nStatistically, his contribution of goals, shots, and passes had dropped significantly compared to previous seasons.[160][161] He still managed to break two longstanding records in a span of seven days: a hat-trick on 16 March against Osasuna saw him overtake Paulino Alcántara's 369 goals to become Barcelona's top goalscorer in all competitions including friendlies, while another hat-trick against Real Madrid on 23 March made him the all-time top scorer in *El Clásico*, ahead of the 18 goals scored by former Real Madrid player Alfredo Di Stéfano.[160][162] Messi finished the campaign with his worst output in five seasons, though he still managed to score 41 goals in all competitions.[161][163] For the first time in five years, Barcelona ended the season without a major trophy; they were defeated in the Copa del Rey final by Real Madrid and lost the league in the last game to Atlético Madrid, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAs Messi developed into a combination of a number 8 (a creator), a 9 (scorer), and a 10 (assistant),[116] he scored an unprecedented 73 goals and provided 29 assists in all club competitions during the 2011–12 season, producing a hat-trick or more on 10 occasions.[117][118][119] He began the campaign by helping Barcelona win both the Spanish and European Super Cups; in the Supercopa de España, he scored three times to achieve a 5–4 aggregate victory over Real Madrid, overtaking Raúl as the competition's all-time top scorer with eight goals.[120][121] At the close of the year, on 18 December, he scored twice in the FIFA Club World Cup final, a 4–0 victory over Santos, earning the Golden Ball as the best player of the tournament, as he had done two years previously.[122] For his efforts in 2011, he again received the FIFA Ballon d'Or, becoming only the fourth player in history to win the Ballon d'Or three times, after Johan Cruyff, Michel Platini, and Marco van Basten.[123] Additionally, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n42. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Lionel Andrés Messi Cuccittini: Matches 2003–04\".

He played as a forward for Ferencváros, Slovan Bratislava, Barcelona, and Espanyol, among other clubs. Regarded as one of the best players in history, Kubala is considered a hero of FC Barcelona.[2] A Hungarian national by birth, he also held Czechoslovak and Spanish citizenship, and played for the national teams of all three countries.[3][4][5]\n\n\nKubala was noted for his quick and skilful dribbling, composed and powerful finishing, and accuracy from free kicks. During the 1950s, he was a leading member of the successful Barcelona team, scoring 280 goals in 345 appearances (including unofficial goals). During the club's 1999 centenary celebrations, a fan's poll declared Kubala the best player ever to play for the Spanish club. After retiring as a player, he had two spells as coach of Barcelona and also coached both Spain's senior national team and Olympic team.[6][7]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and career[edit]\n\n\n### Childhood and youth[edit]\n\n\nKubala was born in Budapest, as were his parents, who came from mixed backgrounds. His mother, Anna Stecz, a factory worker, had Polish, Slovak and Hungarian roots, while his father, Pál Kubala Kurjas, a bricklayer, belonged to the Slovak minority of Hungary. Kubala described himself as a \"cosmopolitan\". He began his career as a junior player with Ganz TE, a factory team that played in the Hungarian third division. At the age of 11, he was playing in teams with other players who were three to five years older.[8] At the age of 18, he signed for Ferencvárosi TC where he was a teammate of Sándor Kocsis. In 1946, Kubala moved to Czechoslovakia, allegedly to avoid military service,[*citation needed*] and joined ŠK Slovan Bratislava. In 1947, he married Anna Viola Daučíkova, the sister of the Czechoslovakian national coach, Ferdinand Daučík. In 1948, Kubala returned to Hungary, again to allegedly avoid military service,[*citation needed*] and joined Vasas SC.\n\n\n\n### Refugee[edit]\n\n\nIn January 1949, as Hungary was occupied by the Soviet Union and became a communist satellite state, Kubala fled the country in the back of a truck. Initially, he arrived in the United States zone of Allied-occupied Austria and then moved on to Italy, where he played briefly for Pro Patria. In May 1949, he also agreed to play for Torino in a testimonial against S.L. Benfica but pulled out after his son became ill. On the way back from Lisbon, the plane carrying the Torino team crashed into the Superga hills, killing all 31 people on board.\n\n\nMeanwhile, the Hungarian Football Federation accused Kubala of breach of contract, leaving the country without permission, and failure to do military service. FIFA backed them and imposed a one-year international ban. In January 1950, Kubala, with Ferdinand Daučík as coach, formed his own team, *Hungaria*, which was made up of fellow refugees fleeing Eastern Europe. In the summer of 1950, the team arrived in Spain to play a series of friendlies against a Madrid XI, a Spain XI and RCD Espanyol. They also played a friendly game against the legendary Millonarios FC lead by Alfredo Di Stéfano.[9][10]\n\n\nDuring these games, Kubala was spotted by both Real Madrid and José Samitier, then chief scout at FC Barcelona. Kubala was offered a contract by Real but was persuaded by Samitier to sign for Barcelona. Samitier used his connections within the government of Francisco Franco to help arrange the transfer. Franco's government wanted to utilize Kubala's status as a refugee from one of the USSR's satellite countries to reinforce the regime's validity, thus helping Kubala obtain Spanish citizenship without delay.[11] In the midst of the Cold War, Kubala's escape to the West was used as propaganda by Franco's government and was made into a successful film, *The Stars Search for Peace*, which saw Kubala and Samitier playing themselves.[12][13]\n\n\n\n### FC Barcelona[edit]\n\n\nKubala signed for FC Barcelona on 15 June 1950, and as part of the deal, Ferdinand Daučík also became the Barcelona coach. However, the ban imposed on Kubala was still in place and he did not make his La Liga debut until 1951. He was permitted to play friendlies, and in two consecutive games against Frankfurter S.V., which FC Barcelona won 4–1 and 10–4, he scored six goals and assisted another five. He also played in the Copa del Generalísimo and helped the club win the trophy in 1951.\n\n\n\n![](image)Kubala (center) with special guests Alfredo Di Stéfano (left) and Ferenc Puskás in a match held in his honour in 1961\nIn his first La Liga season, 1951–52, Kubala scored 26 goals in 19 games. This included 7 goals in a 9–0 win over Sporting de Gijón, five against Celta de Vigo and hat-tricks against Sevilla and Racing de Santander. His seven goals against Gijón remain the record for most goals scored in a single match in La Liga. He also scored in the Copa del Generalísimo final as Barcelona beat Valencia 4–2. This season proved to be one of the club's most successful. Coach Daučík and Kubala, together with players like Emilio Aldecoa, Velasco, Joan Segarra and Ramallets, inspired the team to win five trophies, including La Liga, the Copa del Generalísimo, the Latin Cup, and the Copa Eva Duarte. Kubala missed much of the 1952–53 season after contracting tuberculosis, which threatened to end his playing career. However, he made a miraculous recovery and returned to help Barcelona retain both La Liga and the Copa del Generalísimo. He also scored again in the Copa final win, a 2–1 win over Athletic Bilbao. During his time with Barcelona, he scored a total of 14 hat-tricks.\n\n\nIn 1958, Kubala persuaded two fellow Hungarian refugees Sándor Kocsis and Zoltán Czibor to join him at Barcelona. Together with a young Luis Suárez and Evaristo, they formed the nucleus of the team that won a La Liga / Copa del Generalísimo double in 1959 and a La Liga / Fairs Cup double in 1960. However, Kubala found himself out of favour with coach Helenio Herrera and lost his place in the team. As a result, he missed the 1960 European Cup semi-final against Real Madrid which Barcelona lost 6–2 on aggregate. The result saw Herrera lose his job and Kubala restored to the team. In the 1961 European Cup, Barcelona became the first club to beat Real Madrid in the competition. Inspired by Kubala they won 4–3 on aggregate and subsequently reached the final where they lost to Benfica 2–3. Kubala briefly retired as a player in 1961 and initially became a youth coach at Barcelona, before becoming coach of the senior team for the 1962–63 season. However, after losing a Fairs Cup game to Red Star Belgrade, he was dismissed. In the summer of 1963, he played abroad in the Eastern Canada Professional Soccer League with Toronto City.[14]\n\n\n\n## International career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A statue of Kubala in the grounds of the Camp Nou\nKubala played for three international teams – Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Spain. While playing with ŠK Slovan Bratislava, he appeared in six games and scored four goals for Czechoslovakia between 1946 and 1947. After returning to Budapest in 1948, he played three games for Hungary but failed to score. After adopting Spanish nationality, Kubala played 19 times and scored 11 goals for Spain between 1953 and 1961, being one of a small group to have played for the country having been born elsewhere. The highlight of his international career was a hat-trick for Spain against Turkey in 3–0 win in November 1957.[15][16] Despite playing for three countries, Kubala never played in the finals of a major international tournament. He was included in the Spain squad for the 1962 World Cup but, along with Alfredo Di Stéfano, did not play due to injury.\n\n\nAs well as playing for three international teams, Kubala also played for both a Europe XI and the Catalan XI. On 21 October 1953, England played a Europe XI at Wembley Stadium to celebrate the 90th anniversary of the Football Association and Kubala scored twice in the 4–4 draw. He also played four games and scored four times for the Catalan XI. On 26 January 1955, in a game against Bologna at Les Corts, he was joined by guest player Alfredo Di Stéfano; the Catalan XI won 6–2 with two goals from Kubala and one from Di Stéfano. His last game for the Catalan XI was his own testimonial on 4 March 1993 at the Montjuïc Stadium against an International XI. He played the opening ten minutes of the game at age 65.\n\n\n\n## Coaching career[edit]\n\n\nAfter leaving Barcelona, Kubala accepted a contract as a player-coach with RCD Espanyol and teamed up with Alfredo Di Stéfano. During his time at Espanyol he gave a La Liga debut to his son, Branko. In 1966, he joined FC Zürich, again as player-coach, and made his last appearance in a European Cup game against the competition's eventual winners, Celtic. In 1967, Kubala went to Canada, where at Toronto Falcons he enjoyed something of family reunion with his father-in-law, Ferdinand Daučík, his brother-in-law, Yanko Daucik and his son Branko. He appeared in 19 matches for Toronto, scoring five times.[17]\n\n\nBy the end of 1968, he had returned to La Liga, and after a brief spell at Córdoba CF, he became coach of the Spain national team. Kubala ended the team's 11-year absence from the World Cup when he guided the team to the 1978 World Cup, but could not steer them through the first-round group stage. He also managed them at Euro 80, where they were again eliminated in the first round.\n\n\nIn 1980, he returned to Barcelona as a manager for a second short spell before moving to Saudi Arabia where he managed Al-Hilal. He subsequently managed three other La Liga clubs, including CD Málaga whom he guided to the Segunda División title in 1988. His last coaching position was with Paraguay in 1995.[18][19]\n\n\n\n## Career statistics[edit]\n\n\n### Club[edit]\n\n\n\n\nAppearances and goals by club, season and competition\n| Club\n | Season\n | League\n | Cup\n | Continental\n | Total\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Division | Apps | Goals | Apps | Goals | Apps | Goals | Apps | Goals\n |\n| Ganz TE\n | 1943–44[20] | Nemzeti Bajnokság II | 9 | 2 |  |  |  |  | 9 | 2\n |\n| Ferencvárosi | 1944[20] | Nemzeti Bajnokság I |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| 1945[20] | 22 | 19 |  |  |  |  | 22 | 19\n |\n| 1945–46[20] | 27 | 14 |  |  |  |  | 27 | 14\n |\n| Total\n | 49 | 33 |  |  |  |  | 49 | 33\n |\n| Slovan Bratislava | 1946–47[20] | Czechoslovak First League | 24 | 13 |  |  |  |  | 24 | 13\n |\n| 1947–48[20] | 9 | 1 |  |  |  |  | 9 | 1\n |\n| Total\n | 33 | 14 |  |  |  |  | 33 | 14\n |\n| Vasas | 1948–49[20] | Nemzeti Bajnokság I\n | 20 | 10 |  |  |  |  | 20 | 10\n |\n| 1949–50[20] | 12 | 6 |  |  |  |  | 12 | 6\n |\n| Total\n | 32 | 16 |  |  |  |  | 32 | 16\n |\n| Pro Patria | 1949–50[20] | Serie A | 16 | 9 |  |  |  |  | 16 | 9\n |\n| Hungária\n | 1950–51[20] |  | 6 | 5 |  |  |  |  | 6 | 5\n |\n| Barcelona | 1951–52[20][21] | La Liga | 19 | 26 |  |  |  |  | 19 | 26\n |\n| 1952–53[20][21] | 11 | 7 |  |  |  |  | 11 | 7\n |\n| 1953–54[20][21] | 28 | 23 |  |  |  |  | 28 | 23\n |\n| 1954–55[20][21] | 19 | 14 |  |  |  |  | 19 | 14\n |\n| 1955–56[20][21] | 25 | 14 |  |  | 3[a] | 3 | 28 | 17\n |\n| 1956–57[21] | 18 | 9 | 1 | 0 |  |  | 19 | 9\n |\n| 1957–58[21] | 21 | 12 |  |  |  |  | 21 | 12\n |\n| 1958–59[20][21] | 20 | 9 |  |  | 5[a] | 3 | 25 | 12\n |\n| 1959–60[20][21] | 12 | 7 |  |  | 3[b] | 6 | 15 | 13\n |\n| 1960–61[20][21] | 13 | 10 |  |  | 9[c] | 1 | 22 | 11\n |\n| Total\n | 186 | 131 | 1 | 0 | 20 | 13 | 207 | 144\n |\n| Toronto City | 1962[20] | ECPSL |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Espanyol | 1963–64[20][21] | La Liga\n | 29 | 7 |  |  |  |  | 29 | 7\n |\n| Zürich | 1965–66[20] | Nationalliga A | 12 | 7 |  |  |  |  | 12 | 7\n |\n| 1966–67[20][21] | 0 | 0 |  |  | 1[b] | 0 | 1 | 0\n |\n| Total\n | 12 | 7 |  |  | 1 | 0 | 13 | 7\n |\n| Toronto Falcons | 1967[20] | NPSL | 19 | 5 |  |  |  |  | 19 | 5\n |\n| Career total\n | 391 | 229 | 1 | 0 | 21 | 13 | 413 | 242\n |\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Appearances in Inter-Cities Fairs Cup\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Appearances in European Cup\n3. **^** Eight appearances and one goal in European Cup, one appearance in Inter-Cities Fairs Cup\n\n### International[edit]\n\n\n\n\nAppearances and goals by national team and year[21]\n| National team | Year | Apps | Goals\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Czechoslovakia | 1946 | 1 | 0\n |\n| 1947 | 5 | 4\n |\n| Total | 6 | 4\n |\n| Hungary | 1948 | 3 | 0\n |\n| Total | 3 | 0\n |\n| Spain | 1953 | 3 | 1\n |\n| 1954 | 1 | 0\n |\n| 1955 | 2 | 0\n |\n| 1956 | 4 | 4\n |\n| 1957 | 2 | 4\n |\n| 1958 | 3 | 2\n |\n| 1959 | 3 | 0\n |\n| 1960 | 0 | 0\n |\n| 1961 | 1 | 0\n |\n| Total | 19 | 11\n |\n| Career total\n | 28\n | 15\n |\n\n\n## Honours[edit]\n\n\n### Player[edit]\n\n\n**Barcelona**\n\n\n\n* La Liga: 1951–52, 1952–53, 1958–59, 1959–60\n* Copa del Generalísimo: 1951, 1952, 1953, 1957, 1959\n* Inter-Cities Fairs Cup: 1955–58, 1958–60\n* Latin Cup: 1952\n* Copa Eva Duarte: 1952, 1953\n* European Cup runner-up: 1960-61\n\n\n**Individual**\n\n\n\n* Ballon d'Or: fifth place 1957\n\n\n### Manager[edit]\n\n\n**Málaga**\n\n\n\n* Segunda División: 1987–88\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Gaarskjær, Jesper (2010). *Barça: Historien om FC Barcelona*.

He played as a forward for Ferencváros, Slovan Bratislava, Barcelona, and Espanyol, among other clubs. Regarded as one of the best players in history, Kubala is considered a hero of FC Barcelona.[2] A Hungarian national by birth, he also held Czechoslovak and Spanish citizenship, and played for the national teams of all three countries.[3][4][5]\n\n\nKubala was noted for his quick and skilful dribbling, composed and powerful finishing, and accuracy from free kicks. During the 1950s, he was a leading member of the successful Barcelona team, scoring 280 goals in 345 appearances (including unofficial goals). During the club's 1999 centenary celebrations, a fan's poll declared Kubala the best player ever to play for the Spanish club. After retiring as a player, he had two spells as coach of Barcelona and also coached both Spain's senior national team and Olympic team.[6][7]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and career[edit]\n\n\n### Childhood and youth[edit]\n\n\nKubala was born in Budapest, as were his parents, who came from mixed backgrounds. His mother, Anna Stecz, a factory worker, had Polish, Slovak and Hungarian roots, while his father, Pál Kubala Kurjas, a bricklayer, belonged to the Slovak minority of Hungary. Kubala described himself as a \"cosmopolitan\". He began his career as a junior player with Ganz TE, a factory team that played in the Hungarian third division. At the age of 11, he was playing in teams with other players who were three to five years older.[8] At the age of 18, he signed for Ferencvárosi TC where he was a teammate of Sándor Kocsis. In 1946, Kubala moved to Czechoslovakia, allegedly to avoid military service,[*citation needed*] and joined ŠK Slovan Bratislava. In 1947, he married Anna Viola Daučíkova, the sister of the Czechoslovakian national coach, Ferdinand Daučík. In 1948, Kubala returned to Hungary, again to allegedly avoid military service,[*citation needed*] and joined Vasas SC.\n\n\n\n### Refugee[edit]\n\n\nIn January 1949, as Hungary was occupied by the Soviet Union and became a communist satellite state, Kubala fled the country in the back of a truck. Initially, he arrived in the United States zone of Allied-occupied Austria and then moved on to Italy, where he played briefly for Pro Patria. In May 1949, he also agreed to play for Torino in a testimonial against S.L. Benfica but pulled out after his son became ill. On the way back from Lisbon, the plane carrying the Torino team crashed into the Superga hills, killing all 31 people on board.\n\n\nMeanwhile, the Hungarian Football Federation accused Kubala of breach of contract, leaving the country without permission, and failure to do military service. FIFA backed them and imposed a one-year international ban. In January 1950, Kubala, with Ferdinand Daučík as coach, formed his own team, *Hungaria*, which was made up of fellow refugees fleeing Eastern Europe. In the summer of 1950, the team arrived in Spain to play a series of friendlies against a Madrid XI, a Spain XI and RCD Espanyol. They also played a friendly game against the legendary Millonarios FC lead by Alfredo Di Stéfano.[9][10]\n\n\nDuring these games, Kubala was spotted by both Real Madrid and José Samitier, then chief scout at FC Barcelona. Kubala was offered a contract by Real but was persuaded by Samitier to sign for Barcelona. Samitier used his connections within the government of Francisco Franco to help arrange the transfer. Franco's government wanted to utilize Kubala's status as a refugee from one of the USSR's satellite countries to reinforce the regime's validity, thus helping Kubala obtain Spanish citizenship without delay.[11] In the midst of the Cold War, Kubala's escape to the West was used as propaganda by Franco's government and was made into a successful film, *The Stars Search for Peace*, which saw Kubala and Samitier playing themselves.[12][13]\n\n\n\n### FC Barcelona[edit]\n\n\nKubala signed for FC Barcelona on 15 June 1950, and as part of the deal, Ferdinand Daučík also became the Barcelona coach. However, the ban imposed on Kubala was still in place and he did not make his La Liga debut until 1951. He was permitted to play friendlies, and in two consecutive games against Frankfurter S.V., which FC Barcelona won 4–1 and 10–4, he scored six goals and assisted another five. He also played in the Copa del Generalísimo and helped the club win the trophy in 1951.\n\n\n\n![](image)Kubala (center) with special guests Alfredo Di Stéfano (left) and Ferenc Puskás in a match held in his honour in 1961\nIn his first La Liga season, 1951–52, Kubala scored 26 goals in 19 games. This included 7 goals in a 9–0 win over Sporting de Gijón, five against Celta de Vigo and hat-tricks against Sevilla and Racing de Santander. His seven goals against Gijón remain the record for most goals scored in a single match in La Liga. He also scored in the Copa del Generalísimo final as Barcelona beat Valencia 4–2. This season proved to be one of the club's most successful. Coach Daučík and Kubala, together with players like Emilio Aldecoa, Velasco, Joan Segarra and Ramallets, inspired the team to win five trophies, including La Liga, the Copa del Generalísimo, the Latin Cup, and the Copa Eva Duarte. Kubala missed much of the 1952–53 season after contracting tuberculosis, which threatened to end his playing career. However, he made a miraculous recovery and returned to help Barcelona retain both La Liga and the Copa del Generalísimo. He also scored again in the Copa final win, a 2–1 win over Athletic Bilbao. During his time with Barcelona, he scored a total of 14 hat-tricks.\n\n\nIn 1958, Kubala persuaded two fellow Hungarian refugees Sándor Kocsis and Zoltán Czibor to join him at Barcelona. Together with a young Luis Suárez and Evaristo, they formed the nucleus of the team that won a La Liga / Copa del Generalísimo double in 1959 and a La Liga / Fairs Cup double in 1960. However, Kubala found himself out of favour with coach Helenio Herrera and lost his place in the team. As a result, he missed the 1960 European Cup semi-final against Real Madrid which Barcelona lost 6–2 on aggregate. The result saw Herrera lose his job and Kubala restored to the team. In the 1961 European Cup, Barcelona became the first club to beat Real Madrid in the competition. Inspired by Kubala they won 4–3 on aggregate and subsequently reached the final where they lost to Benfica 2–3. Kubala briefly retired as a player in 1961 and initially became a youth coach at Barcelona, before becoming coach of the senior team for the 1962–63 season. However, after losing a Fairs Cup game to Red Star Belgrade, he was dismissed. In the summer of 1963, he played abroad in the Eastern Canada Professional Soccer League with Toronto City.[14]\n\n\n\n## International career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A statue of Kubala in the grounds of the Camp Nou\nKubala played for three international teams – Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Spain. While playing with ŠK Slovan Bratislava, he appeared in six games and scored four goals for Czechoslovakia between 1946 and 1947. After returning to Budapest in 1948, he played three games for Hungary but failed to score. After adopting Spanish nationality, Kubala played 19 times and scored 11 goals for Spain between 1953 and 1961, being one of a small group to have played for the country having been born elsewhere. The highlight of his international career was a hat-trick for Spain against Turkey in 3–0 win in November 1957.[15][16] Despite playing for three countries, Kubala never played in the finals of a major international tournament. He was included in the Spain squad for the 1962 World Cup but, along with Alfredo Di Stéfano, did not play due to injury.\n\n\nAs well as playing for three international teams, Kubala also played for both a Europe XI and the Catalan XI. On 21 October 1953, England played a Europe XI at Wembley Stadium to celebrate the 90th anniversary of the Football Association and Kubala scored twice in the 4–4 draw. He also played four games and scored four times for the Catalan XI. On 26 January 1955, in a game against Bologna at Les Corts, he was joined by guest player Alfredo Di Stéfano; the Catalan XI won 6–2 with two goals from Kubala and one from Di Stéfano. His last game for the Catalan XI was his own testimonial on 4 March 1993 at the Montjuïc Stadium against an International XI. He played the opening ten minutes of the game at age 65.\n\n\n\n## Coaching career[edit]\n\n\nAfter leaving Barcelona, Kubala accepted a contract as a player-coach with RCD Espanyol and teamed up with Alfredo Di Stéfano. During his time at Espanyol he gave a La Liga debut to his son, Branko. In 1966, he joined FC Zürich, again as player-coach, and made his last appearance in a European Cup game against the competition's eventual winners, Celtic. In 1967, Kubala went to Canada, where at Toronto Falcons he enjoyed something of family reunion with his father-in-law, Ferdinand Daučík, his brother-in-law, Yanko Daucik and his son Branko. He appeared in 19 matches for Toronto, scoring five times.[17]\n\n\nBy the end of 1968, he had returned to La Liga, and after a brief spell at Córdoba CF, he became coach of the Spain national team. Kubala ended the team's 11-year absence from the World Cup when he guided the team to the 1978 World Cup, but could not steer them through the first-round group stage. He also managed them at Euro 80, where they were again eliminated in the first round.\n\n\nIn 1980, he returned to Barcelona as a manager for a second short spell before moving to Saudi Arabia where he managed Al-Hilal. He subsequently managed three other La Liga clubs, including CD Málaga whom he guided to the Segunda División title in 1988.

At age 19, he signed for Groningen, before transferring to Ajax in 2007. There, he won the KNVB Cup and the Eredivisie. In 2011, Suárez signed for Premier League club Liverpool, and won the League Cup in his first full season. Having established a strike partnership with Daniel Sturridge, he equalled the goalscoring record for a 38-game Premier League season and won his first European Golden Shoe in 2014. That summer, Suárez moved to Barcelona in a transfer worth £64.98 million (€82.3 million adjusted for inflation), making him one of the most expensive players of all time.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSuárez has been praised for his work rate,[385] movement,[388] and his quickness[384] that allows him to attack from the outside;[367] as such he occasionally played as an inverted winger on the left flank during his time with Ajax.[389] Additionally, Suárez has a liking for often executing dummies (going around the defenders with a fake-out) within his style of dribbling.[390] During his time in Barcelona, he was known for constantly scoring through volleys or half-volleys.[391][392] Suárez also gained a reputation for consistently scoring acrobatic goals, often shooting off balance, or in air, or with overhead bicycle kicks.[393][394][395] Moreover, he is an accurate free kick taker,[396] and has also been known to take penalties.[397]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 1 Messi was given the 2015 award, but rejected it.

At age 19, he signed for Groningen, before transferring to Ajax in 2007. There, he won the KNVB Cup and the Eredivisie.

He later coached Atlético Madrid, Nice and Barcelona and worked as a scout for both Barcelona and Real Madrid.\n\n\nDuring his playing career with Barcelona, Samitier scored 187 official goals and was the club's all-time highest goalscorer at the time of his retirement. As of 2020, he is the club's fifth all-time top goalscorer behind Luis Suárez, László Kubala, César, and Lionel Messi. As a player, Samitier pioneered the *midfield general* role and was nicknamed *Surrealista* (*The Surrealist*) and *Home Magosta* (*The Grasshopper Man*)[3] due to his style.\n\n\nAs a manager, he led Barcelona to a title in La Liga in 1945, and as a scout he recruited another Barcelona legend, László Kubala. However, Samitier was later accused of acting as a double agent when the club tried to sign Alfredo Di Stéfano, and in the 1960s, he fell out with Helenio Herrera and went to work for Real Madrid. Despite his role in the Di Stéfano affair,[3] twice defecting to Real Madrid, and his friendship with Francisco Franco,[3] Samitier remained a legendary figure of FC Barcelona.[*citation needed*] When he died in 1972, he was given a state funeral and a street that leads to Camp Nou.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## Club career[edit]\n\n\n### Early life[edit]\n\n\nBorn in Barcelona, Catalonia, Samitier played as a junior for FC Internacional before, at the age of 17, he made his debut for FC Barcelona in 1919. As his signing-on bonus, he received a luminous watch and a three-piece suit. Among his teammates at the club was his childhood friend Sagibarba. During holidays at the Catalan resort of Cadaqués, Samitier and Sagibarba had played football with, among others, Salvador Dalí. He was also friends with the famous Spanish artist Salvador Dalí.[4]\n\n\n\n### FC Barcelona[edit]\n\n\nBy 1925 Samitier was the highest-paid player in Spain. He was a member of the legendary FC Barcelona team, coached by Jack Greenwell, that, apart from Sagibarba, also included Paulino Alcántara, Ricardo Zamora, Félix Sesúmaga and, later, Franz Platko. Between 1919 and 1933 he won twelve Campionat de Catalunya titles, five Copa del Rey and the very first La Liga title. Among the goals he scored were four in the Copa del Rey finals of 1922, 1925, 1926 and 1928.\n\n\n\n### Madrid CF[edit]\n\n\nIn 1933 an aging Samiter found himself in dispute with the FC Barcelona management and he was dropped from the first team. Real Madrid, then known as *Madrid CF*, were quick to take advantage of the situation. Samitier was reunited with both his friend Ricardo Zamora and then Francisco Bru. Although his career with the Madrid club was short, he did help them win a title in La Liga 1932–33 and the Copa de España in 1934.\n\n\n\n### Samitier Tribute[edit]\n\n\nThe tribute match to Samitier was held on 13 May 1934 at Estadio Chamartín in Madrid, between Madrid FC and Espanyol, and Samitier scored both the first and the last goals of an 8–2 win. Other Madrid goalscorers include the likes of Eugenio, Hilario, Luis Regueiro and Lazcano, while José Padrón scored one of Espanyol's consolation goals.\n\n\n**Madrid**: Zamora (Cayol 45´); Quesada, Maciá, P. Regueiro (Sauto), Bonet, Gurruchaga, (Valle 45´), Lazcano, L. Regueiro (Olivares 45´) Samitier, Hilario and Eugenio.\n\n\n**Espanyol**: Martorell (Eizaguirre 45´); Mas, Pérez, Cifuentes, Solé (Antero 45´), Cristià, Prats, Edelmiro, Iriondo, Padrón and Bosch.\n\n\n\n### Exile in France[edit]\n\n\nIn 1936 Samitier made a brief start to his career as a coach. He succeeded Fred Pentland at Atlético Madrid in the middle of the season, but failed to prevent them from being relegated. However, Samitier's new career and Atlético's relegation were postponed with the start of the Spanish Civil War. He found himself arrested by an anarchist militia, but was eventually released and left for France on a warship. His *escape* was later used by the Nationalist side in an account printed in *Marca*. In October 1936 he joined OGC Nice as a player, where he was reunited once again with Ricardo Zamora. He subsequently scored 21 goals in 48 matches for the French team.[5] He eventually retired as a player in 1939 and was briefly coach at OGC Nice in 1942.\n\n\n\n### Return to Barcelona[edit]\n\n\nSamitier returned to Spain and became manager of CF Barcelona in 1944. In 1945 he guided them to only their second ever La Liga title. Then they beat the Copa del Generalísimo winners Atlético Bilbao to win the Copa de Oro Argentina. Samitier subsequently worked as the clubs *chief scout* and was instrumental in the recruitment of another CF Barcelona legend Ladislao Kubala.\n\n\nIn the summer of 1950 Kubala arrived in Spain with his own team, *Hungaria*. The team was made up of fellow refugees fleeing Eastern Europe. They played a series of friendlies against a *Madrid Select XI*, a Spain XI and RCD Español. During these games, Kubala was spotted by both Real Madrid and Samitier. Kubala was offered a contract by Real but was then persuaded by Samitier to sign for CF Barcelona. It has been suggested that Samitier used his connections within Francoist Spain to help arrange the transfer. In the midst of the Cold War, Kubala's escape to the West was used by Francoist Spain and was made into a film *The Stars Search for Peace* which saw Kubala and Samitier playing themselves.\n\n\n\n## International career[edit]\n\n\nIn 1920, together with Ricardo Zamora, Félix Sesúmaga, Pichichi and José María Belauste, Samitier was a member of the first ever Spanish national squad. The squad, coached by Francisco Bru, won the silver medal at the 1920 Olympic Games.[6] He subsequently made 21 appearances and scored 2 goals for Spain.[1]\n\n\nSamitier also played 26 games and scored at least 20 goals for the Catalan XI.[*citation needed*] However, records from the era do not always include accurate statistics and he may have played and scored more. Together with Paulino Alcántara, Sagibarba and Zamora, he helped the Catalan XI win the Prince of Asturias Cup twice in the 1920s, winning the inter-regional competition in 1923–24 and 1926. In the 1924 final, he scored twice in a 4–4 draw against Castile/Madrid XI and scored again in the replay as the Catalan team won 3–2.[7] Catalonia faced Czechoslovakia twice in 1925 and 1926, and Samitier managed to score in both games, a 2–1 win and a 2–1 defeat, respecteviely.[8][9] His last game for the Catalan XI was his own testimonial on 19 January 1936 at the *Les Corts*. He scored in a 1–1 draw with SK Sidenice of Czechoslovakia.\n\n\n\n## Career statistics[edit]\n\n\n### Club[edit]\n\n\n\n\nAppearances and goals by club, season and competition\n| Club\n | Season\n | League | Cup | Regional | Friendly\n | Total\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Division | Apps | Goals | Apps | Goals | Apps | Goals | Apps | Goals | Apps | Goals\n |\n| Internacional\n | 1916–17\n | La Liga | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 5 | 0 |  |  | 5 | 0\n |\n| 1917–18\n | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 4 | 0 |  |  | 4 | 0\n |\n| 1918–19\n | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 9 | 1 |  |  | 9 | 1\n |\n| Total\n | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 18 | 1 |  |  | 18 | 1\n |\n| FC Barcelona | 1918–19\n | La Liga\n | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1\n |\n| 1919–20\n | 0 | 0 | 3 | 0 | 10 | 0 | 30 | 2 | 43 | 2\n |\n| 1920–21\n | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 12 | 1 | 33 | 0 | 45 | 1\n |\n| 1921–22\n | 0 | 0 | 5 | 2 | 7 | 0 | 37 | 22 | 49 | 24\n |\n| 1922–23\n | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 10 | 0 | 48 | 21 | 58 | 21\n |\n| 1923–24\n | 0 | 0 | 7 | 5 | 10 | 14 | 27 | 41 | 44 | 60\n |\n| 1924–25\n | 0 | 0 | 8 | 10 | 12 | 10 | 17 | 12 | 37 | 32\n |\n| 1925–26\n | 0 | 0 | 4 | 8 | 10 | 7 | 6 | 3 | 21 | 17\n |\n| 1926–27\n | 0 | 0 | 7 | 3 | 14 | 21 | 25 | 23 | 46 | 47\n |\n| 1927–28\n | 0 | 0 | 15 | 21 | 10 | 16 | 10 | 13 | 35 | 50\n |\n| 1928–29\n | 13 | 7 | 7 | 4 | 4 | 2 | 6 | 4 | 30 | 17\n |\n| 1929–30\n | 2 | 3 | 9 | 7 | 9 | 2 | 8 | 8 | 28 | 20\n |\n| 1930–31\n | 1 | 0 | 3 | 2 | 4 | 5 | 12 | 19 | 20 | 26\n |\n| 1931–32\n | 12 | 11 | 7 | 1 | 12 | 14 | 5 | 2 | 36 | 28\n |\n| 1932–33\n | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 6 | 10 | 4 | 3 | 10 | 13\n |\n| 1934–35\n | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2\n |\n| 1935–36\n | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 3 | 1 | 3\n |\n| Total\n | 28 | 21 | 73 | 63 | 130 | 102 | 271 | 179 | 504 | 365\n |\n| Real Madrid CF | 1932–33\n | La Liga\n | 6 | 3 | 0 | 0 |  |  |  |  | 6 | 3\n |\n| 1933–34\n | 2 | 1 | 8 | 5 | 5 | 3 |  |  | 15 | 9\n |\n| Total\n | 8 | 4 | 8 | 5 | 5 | 3 |  |  | 21 | 12\n |\n| Career total\n | 36 | 25 | 81 | 68 | 153 | 106 | 271 | 179 | 543 | 378\n |\n\n\n### International[edit]\n\n\n*Scores and results list Spain's goal tally first, score column indicates score after each Samitier goal.*\n\n\nList of international goals scored by Josep Samitier[1]\n| No.\n | Date\n | Venue\n | Appearance\n | Opponent\n | Score\n | Result\n | Competition\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | 21 December 1924 | Camp de Les Corts, Barcelona, Spain | 11 | ![](image) Austria | 2–1 | 2–1 | Friendly |\n| 2 | 13 December 1931 | Dalymount Park, Dublin, Republic of Ireland | 21 | ![](image) Republic of Ireland | 4–0 | 5–0\n |\n\n\n## Honours[edit]\n\n\n### Player[edit]\n\n\n#### Club[edit]\n\n\n**FC Barcelona**\n\n\n\n* La Liga: 1929\n* Copa del Rey (5): 1920, 1922, 1925, 1926, 1928\n* Catalan Championship (12): 1918–19, 1919–20, 1920–21, 1921–22, 1923–24, 1924–25, 1925–26, 1926–27, 1927–28, 1929–30, 1930–31, 1931–32\n\n\n**Madrid CF**\n\n\n\n* La Liga: 1932–33\n* Copa del Rey: 1934\n\n\n#### International[edit]\n\n\n**Spain**\n\n\n\n* Olympic Games Silver medal: 1920\n\n\n**Catalan XI**\n\n\n\n* Prince of Asturias Cup: 1923-24 and 1926\n\n\n### Manager[edit]\n\n\n**CF Barcelona**\n\n\n\n* La Liga: 1944–45\n* Copa de Oro Argentina: 1945\n\n\n## Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** \"José Samitier, international footballer\". *eu-football.info*.

He later coached Atlético Madrid, Nice and Barcelona and worked as a scout for both Barcelona and Real Madrid.\n\n\nDuring his playing career with Barcelona, Samitier scored 187 official goals and was the club's all-time highest goalscorer at the time of his retirement. As of 2020, he is the club's fifth all-time top goalscorer behind Luis Suárez, László Kubala, César, and Lionel Messi. As a player, Samitier pioneered the *midfield general* role and was nicknamed *Surrealista* (*The Surrealist*) and *Home Magosta* (*The Grasshopper Man*)[3] due to his style.\n\n\nAs a manager, he led Barcelona to a title in La Liga in 1945, and as a scout he recruited another Barcelona legend, László Kubala. However, Samitier was later accused of acting as a double agent when the club tried to sign Alfredo Di Stéfano, and in the 1960s, he fell out with Helenio Herrera and went to work for Real Madrid. Despite his role in the Di Stéfano affair,[3] twice defecting to Real Madrid, and his friendship with Francisco Franco,[3] Samitier remained a legendary figure of FC Barcelona.[*citation needed*] When he died in 1972, he was given a state funeral and a street that leads to Camp Nou.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## Club career[edit]\n\n\n### Early life[edit]\n\n\nBorn in Barcelona, Catalonia, Samitier played as a junior for FC Internacional before, at the age of 17, he made his debut for FC Barcelona in 1919. As his signing-on bonus, he received a luminous watch and a three-piece suit. Among his teammates at the club was his childhood friend Sagibarba. During holidays at the Catalan resort of Cadaqués, Samitier and Sagibarba had played football with, among others, Salvador Dalí. He was also friends with the famous Spanish artist Salvador Dalí.[4]\n\n\n\n### FC Barcelona[edit]\n\n\nBy 1925 Samitier was the highest-paid player in Spain. He was a member of the legendary FC Barcelona team, coached by Jack Greenwell, that, apart from Sagibarba, also included Paulino Alcántara, Ricardo Zamora, Félix Sesúmaga and, later, Franz Platko. Between 1919 and 1933 he won twelve Campionat de Catalunya titles, five Copa del Rey and the very first La Liga title. Among the goals he scored were four in the Copa del Rey finals of 1922, 1925, 1926 and 1928.\n\n\n\n### Madrid CF[edit]\n\n\nIn 1933 an aging Samiter found himself in dispute with the FC Barcelona management and he was dropped from the first team. Real Madrid, then known as *Madrid CF*, were quick to take advantage of the situation. Samitier was reunited with both his friend Ricardo Zamora and then Francisco Bru. Although his career with the Madrid club was short, he did help them win a title in La Liga 1932–33 and the Copa de España in 1934.\n\n\n\n### Samitier Tribute[edit]\n\n\nThe tribute match to Samitier was held on 13 May 1934 at Estadio Chamartín in Madrid, between Madrid FC and Espanyol, and Samitier scored both the first and the last goals of an 8–2 win. Other Madrid goalscorers include the likes of Eugenio, Hilario, Luis Regueiro and Lazcano, while José Padrón scored one of Espanyol's consolation goals.\n\n\n**Madrid**: Zamora (Cayol 45´); Quesada, Maciá, P. Regueiro (Sauto), Bonet, Gurruchaga, (Valle 45´), Lazcano, L. Regueiro (Olivares 45´) Samitier, Hilario and Eugenio.\n\n\n**Espanyol**: Martorell (Eizaguirre 45´); Mas, Pérez, Cifuentes, Solé (Antero 45´), Cristià, Prats, Edelmiro, Iriondo, Padrón and Bosch.\n\n\n\n### Exile in France[edit]\n\n\nIn 1936 Samitier made a brief start to his career as a coach. He succeeded Fred Pentland at Atlético Madrid in the middle of the season, but failed to prevent them from being relegated. However, Samitier's new career and Atlético's relegation were postponed with the start of the Spanish Civil War. He found himself arrested by an anarchist militia, but was eventually released and left for France on a warship. His *escape* was later used by the Nationalist side in an account printed in *Marca*. In October 1936 he joined OGC Nice as a player, where he was reunited once again with Ricardo Zamora. He subsequently scored 21 goals in 48 matches for the French team.[5] He eventually retired as a player in 1939 and was briefly coach at OGC Nice in 1942.\n\n\n\n### Return to Barcelona[edit]\n\n\nSamitier returned to Spain and became manager of CF Barcelona in 1944. In 1945 he guided them to only their second ever La Liga title. Then they beat the Copa del Generalísimo winners Atlético Bilbao to win the Copa de Oro Argentina. Samitier subsequently worked as the clubs *chief scout* and was instrumental in the recruitment of another CF Barcelona legend Ladislao Kubala.\n\n\nIn the summer of 1950 Kubala arrived in Spain with his own team, *Hungaria*. The team was made up of fellow refugees fleeing Eastern Europe. They played a series of friendlies against a *Madrid Select XI*, a Spain XI and RCD Español. During these games, Kubala was spotted by both Real Madrid and Samitier. Kubala was offered a contract by Real but was then persuaded by Samitier to sign for CF Barcelona. It has been suggested that Samitier used his connections within Francoist Spain to help arrange the transfer. In the midst of the Cold War, Kubala's escape to the West was used by Francoist Spain and was made into a film *The Stars Search for Peace* which saw Kubala and Samitier playing themselves.\n\n\n\n## International career[edit]\n\n\nIn 1920, together with Ricardo Zamora, Félix Sesúmaga, Pichichi and José María Belauste, Samitier was a member of the first ever Spanish national squad. The squad, coached by Francisco Bru, won the silver medal at the 1920 Olympic Games.[6] He subsequently made 21 appearances and scored 2 goals for Spain.[1]\n\n\nSamitier also played 26 games and scored at least 20 goals for the Catalan XI.[*citation needed*] However, records from the era do not always include accurate statistics and he may have played and scored more. Together with Paulino Alcántara, Sagibarba and Zamora, he helped the Catalan XI win the Prince of Asturias Cup twice in the 1920s, winning the inter-regional competition in 1923–24 and 1926. In the 1924 final, he scored twice in a 4–4 draw against Castile/Madrid XI and scored again in the replay as the Catalan team won 3–2.[7] Catalonia faced Czechoslovakia twice in 1925 and 1926, and Samitier managed to score in both games, a 2–1 win and a 2–1 defeat, respecteviely.[8][9] His last game for the Catalan XI was his own testimonial on 19 January 1936 at the *Les Corts*.
