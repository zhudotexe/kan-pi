It includes a list of all women who have served in the Senate, a list of current female senators, and a list of states represented by women in the Senate. The first female U.S. senator, Rebecca Latimer Felton, represented Georgia for a single day in 1922, and the first woman elected to the Senate, Hattie Caraway, was elected from Arkansas in 1932. Sixty women have served in the upper house of the United States Congress since its establishment in 1789. As of October 3, 2023, there are 25 women (15 Democrats, 9 Republicans, and 1 Independent) serving as U.S. senators.\n\n\nNancy Kassebaum is currently the oldest living former female member of the Senate at the age 91.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rebecca Latimer Felton (D-Georgia), the first female member of the United States Senate, who served for a single day in 1922.\n![](image)One woman (Barbara Mikulski) was reelected and four women were elected to the Senate in 1992, the \"Year of the Woman,\" Left to right: Senators Murray, Moseley Braun, Mikulski, Feinstein, and Boxer.\n![](image)By the 111th United States Congress (2009–2011), the number of women senators had increased to 17, including 4 Republicans and 13 Democrats\nFor its first 130 years in existence, the Senate's membership was entirely male. Until 1920, few women ran for the Senate. Until the 1990s, very few were elected. This paucity of women was due to many factors, including the lack of women's suffrage in many states until the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, women's limited access to higher education until the mid-1900s, public perceptions of gender roles, and barriers to women's advancement such as sex discrimination.\n\n\nThe first woman to serve in the U.S. Senate was Rebecca Latimer Felton; she represented Georgia for one day in 1922. Ten years later, Hattie Caraway became the first woman to win election to the Senate, representing Arkansas. In 1949, Margaret Chase Smith began her service in the Senate; she was the first woman to serve in both the House and Senate. Her 1960 reelection bid resulted in Chase Smith winning the nation's first-ever United States Senate election with two female major party nominees. In 1972, Elaine Edwards was appointed as the first Catholic woman in the Senate by her husband, the Governor of Louisiana, while she was Louisiana's First Lady; she retired after three months. In 1978, Muriel Humphrey Brown became the first and only Second Lady to serve in the United States Senate, after Hubert Humphrey's unexpected death in office. Humphrey Brown was appointed by the Governor of Minnesota to fill her late husband's Senate seat; she served for less than one year and did not seek to be elected to her husband's seat.\n\n\nIn 1978, Nancy Kassebaum became the first woman ever elected to a full term in the Senate, representing Kansas, without her husband having previously served in Congress.[n 1] Since 1978, there has always been at least one woman in the Senate. The first woman to be elected to the Senate without any family connections was Florida Republican Paula Hawkins, elected in 1980. She was also the first and, to date, only female member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints elected to the United States Senate. In 1990, there were still few women in the Senate as compared to the number of women in the House. The trend of few women in the Senate began to change in the wake of the Clarence Thomas Supreme Court nomination hearings and the subsequent election of the 103rd United States Congress in 1992, which was dubbed the \"Year of the Woman.\"[1] Barbara Mikulski was reelected and four new Democratic women were elected to the Senate. They were Patty Murray of Washington, Carol Moseley Braun of Illinois, Dianne Feinstein of California, and Barbara Boxer of California. Carol Moseley Braun was the first woman of color to serve in the Senate and the first woman to defeat an incumbent senator after she won the 1992 Democratic primary election over Alan Dixon. Later in 1992, Feinstein was the first woman to defeat an incumbent senator from a different party when she defeated John Seymour in a special election. Feinstein entered the Senate the same year as the first female Jewish senator.[2][3][4]\n\n\nBathroom facilities for women in the Senate on the Senate chamber level were first provided in 1992.[5] Women were not allowed to wear pants on the Senate floor until 1993.[6][7] In 1993, Senators Barbara Mikulski and Carol Moseley Braun wore pants onto the floor in defiance of the rule, and female support staff followed soon after, with the rule being amended later that year by Senate Sergeant-at-Arms Martha Pope to allow women to wear pants on the floor so long as they also wore a jacket.[6][7]\n\n\nThe first time two female senators from the same state served concurrently was beginning in 1993; Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer (both D-CA) were both elected in 1992, with Feinstein taking office that same year (as the result of a special election) and Boxer taking office in 1993; Boxer served until 2016, when she retired, and Feinstein was joined by Kamala Harris. In June 1993, Kay Bailey Hutchison won a special election in Texas, and joined Kassebaum as a fellow female Republican senator. These additions significantly diminished the popular perception of the Senate as an exclusive \"boys' club\". Since 1992, there has been at least one new woman elected to the Senate every two years, with the exception of 2004 (Lisa Murkowski was elected for the first time in 2004, but had been appointed to the seat since 2002). \n\n\n\n![](image)Eight Democratic women senators appear at the 2008 Democratic Convention in Denver. It has become a tradition at Democratic conventions for incumbent women senators to appear on opening night.Olympia Snowe of Maine arrived in the Senate in 1995, having previously served in the US House of Representatives and both houses of the Maine state legislature. She and later Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, and Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming are the only women to have served in both houses of a state legislature and both houses of the federal legislature. In 2000, Stabenow and Maria Cantwell became the first women to defeat incumbent *elected* senators in a general election, unseating Senators Spencer Abraham and Slade Gorton respectively.[n 2] Hillary Clinton is the first and only First Lady to run for or win a Senate seat. Clinton joined the Senate in 2001, becoming the first female senator from New York, and served until 2009, when she resigned to become the 67th United States Secretary of State, under President Barack Obama. She was replaced by Kirsten Gillibrand, who has been elected three times and was herself a candidate for president in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries.\n\n\nIn 2008, Kay Hagan became the first woman to unseat a female incumbent, Elizabeth Dole. Upon the opening of the 112th United States Congress in 2011, New Hampshire Democrat Jeanne Shaheen was joined by newly elected Republican Kelly Ayotte, making up the first Senate delegation of two women belonging to different parties.\n\n\nIn November 2022, Dianne Feinstein became the longest-serving female senator in history,[8] surpassing Barbara Mikulski,[9][10] having served for 30 years.[11] Feinstein was retiring at the end of her last term, scheduled for January 3, 2025,[12] but died on September 29, 2023, before her term ended.[13]\n\n\nIn 2012, a record five new female senators were elected. This beat the record of four new female senators from 1992 and set the record of five new women and eleven female senators in one Senate class. The five new women were Democrats Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and Republican Deb Fischer of Nebraska. Hirono was the first Asian-American woman and first Buddhist in the Senate, and Baldwin was the first openly gay person in the Senate.\n\n\nIn 2014, Joni Ernst was elected as the first female combat veteran to serve in the Senate. In 2016, Catherine Cortez Masto was elected as the first Latina senator, while Tammy Duckworth was elected as the first female double amputee in the Senate.[14] In a June 2016 primary election, as a result of California's recent establishment of the top-two primary, Attorney General of California Kamala Harris and U.S. Representative Loretta Sanchez became the first women of the same party to advance to a Senate general election. In November 2016, Harris became the first woman to defeat a woman of the same party in a Senate general election. \n\n\nIn 2016, Hillary Clinton became the first former female senator to win a major party's nomination for President of the United States. Despite winning a plurality of the popular vote, she ultimately lost her bid to Donald Trump.\n\n\nStarting in 2017, United States Senators Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, have held the distinction of being the first and second women elected as both the governor of a state and a United States senator from a state; both served as Governor of New Hampshire before their time in the Senate.\n\n\nIn 2018, Kyrsten Sinema defeated Martha McSally, becoming Arizona's first female senator, as well as the first openly bisexual senator from any state. Two weeks later, Arizona Governor Doug Ducey announced that he would appoint McSally to Arizona's other Senate seat, which was becoming vacant with the resignation of Jon Kyl. Sinema and McSally have been the only concurrently serving female senators to have previously faced off against each other in a Senate election. McSally exited the Senate in late 2020 after losing that year's special election to Mark Kelly, a Democrat.\n\n\nAlso in 2018, Jacky Rosen made political history as the first female one-term outgoing U.S. representative ever elected to the Senate.[15]\n\n\nIn 2023, Patty Murray became the first woman to serve as president pro tempore, a role traditionally given to the most senior member of the majority party in the United States Senate. Dianne Feinstein was the most senior Democratic senator, but declined to serve. This made Murray the third person in line to become president, after the vice president and the Speaker of the House.[16]\n\n\nSixty women have served in the United States Senate since its establishment in 1789.[17] Cumulatively, 36 female U.S. senators have been Democrats, while 23 have been Republicans and one is an independent. As of 2023, no female U.S. senator has ever won election to the House after her Senate term, resigned from a state governorship for the purpose of a Senate appointment by her successor, also won election as an independent or to represent more than one state in non-consecutive elections, served both seats of a state at different times, or represented a third party in her career. In December 2022, Senator Kyrsten Sinema became the first female senator to switch her party affiliation while in office. In September 2023, Senator Dianne Feinstein became the first female senator to die in office.\n\n\nSome female U.S. senators have later run for U.S. president or vice president—see list of female United States presidential and vice presidential candidates. In 2020, Kamala Harris became the first female senator, current or past, to win her vice presidential election bid and become the first female President of the United States Senate in American history.\n\n\n\n## Election, selection, and family[edit]\n\n\nBefore 2001, a plurality of women joined the U.S. Senate through appointment following the death or resignation of a husband or father who previously held the seat. An example is Muriel Humphrey (D-MN), the widow of former senator and Vice President Hubert Humphrey; she was appointed to fill his seat until a special election was held (in which she did not run). However, with the election of three women in 2000, the balance shifted; more women have now entered service as a senator by winning elections than by being appointed.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nRecent examples of selection include Jean Carnahan and Lisa Murkowski. In 2000, Jean Carnahan (D-MO) was appointed to fill the Senate seat won by her recently deceased husband, Mel Carnahan. Carnahan—even though dead—defeated the incumbent senator, John Ashcroft. Carnahan's widow was named to fill his seat by Missouri Governor Roger Wilson until a special election was held. However, she lost the subsequent 2002 election to fill out the rest of the six-year term. In 2002, Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) was appointed by her father Alaska Governor Frank Murkowski, who had resigned from the Senate to become governor, to serve the remaining two years of his term. Lisa Murkowski defeated former governor Tony Knowles in her retention bid in 2004.\n\n\nTwo recent members of the Senate brought with them a combination of name recognition resulting from the political careers of their famous husbands and their own substantial experience in public affairs. The first, former senator Elizabeth Dole (R-NC), was married to former Senate Majority Leader and 1996 Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole and served as Secretary of Transportation under President Ronald Reagan and Secretary of Labor under President George H.W. Bush; she later ran a losing bid for the Republican presidential nomination in 2000. The other, former senator Hillary Clinton (D-NY), wife of former President Bill Clinton, was First Lady of the United States and First Lady of Arkansas before taking her seat in 2000. She too ran an unsuccessful campaign for her party's presidential nomination in 2008; she resigned in 2009 to become the secretary of state for the eventual victor of that election, Barack Obama. In 2016, she ran a successful campaign for her party's presidential nomination, eventually losing in the general election to Republican nominee Donald Trump.\n\n\nAnother famous name is Nancy Landon Kassebaum (R-KS), the daughter of former Kansas governor and one-time presidential candidate Alf Landon. After retiring from the Senate, she married former senator Howard Baker (R-TN). Kassebaum has the distinction of being the first female elected senator who did not succeed her husband in Congress (Margaret Chase Smith was only elected to the Senate after succeeding her husband to his House seat).\n\n\nAmong the women elected or appointed in Senate history, by stature, Barbara Boxer (D-CA) and Barbara Mikulski (D-MD) are the shortest, at 4 feet 11 inches (1.50 m), whereas Kelly Loeffler (R-GA) is the tallest, at 5 feet 11 inches (1.80 m).[18][19][20]\n\n\n\n## List of female U.S. senators[edit]\n\n\n| Portrait\n | Name(lifespan) | State\n | Term\n | Entered by\n | Left for\n | Party\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Term start\n | Term end\n | Length ofservice (days)\n |\n| ![Sen.

This is the second-highest number of women to have served concurrently in the Senate in U.S. history. Fifteen are Democrats, nine are Republicans, and one is an independent.\n\n\nIn January 2019, four new women senators (Blackburn, McSally, Rosen, and Sinema) were seated although two others (Heitkamp and McCaskill) lost reelection bids, so the number of female senators reached 25, at the time with 17 being Democrats and 8 being Republicans. In January 2020, Kelly Loeffler was appointed to the Senate from Georgia, increasing the number of women in the Senate to 26, the highest proportion of women serving as U.S. senators in history.\n\n\nMartha McSally lost an election to finish John McCain's unexpired term on November 3, 2020, and left the Congress on December 2, which reduced the number of female senators to 25. On January 3, 2021, Cynthia Lummis, the first woman senator from Wyoming, began her term, so the number of female senators reached 26 once again. Meanwhile, Kamala Harris was elected Vice President of the United States; she resigned her Senate seat on January 18 in anticipation of the scheduled commencement of her term as Vice President (and thus President of the Senate) on January 20, which reduced the number of female senators to 25. In addition, Loeffler lost the January 5 special election runoff for the remainder of the term to which she had been appointed, and she left office also on January 20, which further reduced the number of women serving in the Senate to 24. On December 9, 2022, Sinema defected from the Democratic Party to become a registered independent, leaving 15 of her fellow women senators from her former party, and on January 3, 2023, Katie Britt, the first Republican woman senator from Alabama and also the first woman ever elected to the Senate from her state, began her term as well, increasing the number to 25 again. The death of Dianne Feinstein on September 29, 2023, brought the number back down to 24. The seating of Feinstein's replacement, appointed senator Laphonza Butler, on October 3 returned the figure to 25.\n\n\nAs of January 2023, four states (Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, and Washington) are represented by two female U.S. senators. Eleven incumbent women in the Senate are former U.S. representatives: Senators Stabenow, Cantwell, Gillibrand, Baldwin, Hirono, Moore Capito, Duckworth, Sinema, Rosen, Blackburn, and Lummis.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Class | State\n | Name\n | Party\n | Prior experience\n | First tookoffice\n | Born\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 3\n | Alabama\n | Katie Britt | Republican | CEO of the Business Council of Alabama, chief of staff to predecessor Richard Shelby | 2023\n(age 40)\n | 1982\n |\n| 3\n | Alaska\n | Lisa Murkowski | Republican | Alaska House of Representatives | 2002\n(age 45)\n | 1957\n |\n| 1\n | Arizona\n | Kyrsten Sinema | Independent[n 25] | Arizona House of Representatives, Arizona Senate, U.S. House of Representatives | 2019\n(age 42)\n | 1976\n |\n| 1\n | California\n | Laphonza Butler | Democratic | Member of the Board of Regents of the University of California, President of EMILY's List | 2023\n(age 44)\n | 1979\n |\n| 1\n | Hawaii\n | Mazie Hirono | Democratic | Hawaii House of Representatives, Lieutenant Governor of Hawaii, gubernatorial nominee, U.S. House of Representatives\n | 2013\n(age 66)\n | 1947\n |\n| 3\n | Illinois\n | Tammy Duckworth | Democratic | U.S. House of Representatives\n | 2017\n(age 49)\n | 1968\n |\n| 2\n | Iowa\n | Joni Ernst | Republican | Montgomery County Auditor, Iowa Senate | 2015\n(age 45)\n | 1970\n |\n| 2\n | Maine\n | Susan Collins | Republican | Massachusetts Deputy Treasurer, gubernatorial nominee | 1997\n(age 45)\n | 1952\n |\n| 1\n | Massachusetts\n | Elizabeth Warren | Democratic | Special Advisor to the President for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau | 2013\n(age 64)\n | 1949\n |\n| 1\n | Michigan\n | Debbie Stabenow | Democratic | Michigan House of Representatives, Michigan Senate, U.S. House of Representatives\n | 2001\n(age 51)\n | 1950\n |\n| 1\n | Minnesota\n | Amy Klobuchar | Democratic-Farmer-Labor | Hennepin County Attorney\n | 2007\n(age 47)\n | 1960\n |\n| 2\n | Minnesota\n | Tina Smith | Democratic-Farmer-Labor | Lieutenant Governor of Minnesota | 2018\n(age 60)\n | 1958\n |\n| 2\n | Mississippi\n | Cindy Hyde-Smith | Republican | Mississippi Senate, Mississippi Commissioner of Agriculture and Commerce | 2018\n(age 59)\n | 1959\n |\n| 1\n | Nebraska\n | Deb Fischer | Republican | Nebraska Legislature | 2013\n(age 62)\n | 1951\n |\n| 3\n | Nevada\n | Catherine Cortez Masto | Democratic | Nevada Attorney General | 2017\n(age 53)\n | 1964\n |\n| 1\n | Nevada\n | Jacky Rosen | Democratic | U.S. House of Representatives\n | 2019\n(age 61)\n | 1957\n |\n| 2\n | New Hampshire\n | Jeanne Shaheen | Democratic | New Hampshire Senate, Governor of New Hampshire | 2009\n(age 62)\n | 1947\n |\n| 3\n | New Hampshire\n | Maggie Hassan | Democratic | New Hampshire Senate, Governor of New Hampshire\n | 2017\n(age 58)\n | 1958\n |\n| 1\n | New York\n | Kirsten Gillibrand | Democratic | U.S. House of Representatives\n | 2009\n(age 43)\n | 1966\n |\n| 1\n | Tennessee\n | Marsha Blackburn | Republican | Tennessee Senate, U.S. House of Representatives\n | 2019\n(age 66)\n | 1952\n |\n| 3\n | Washington\n | Patty Murray | Democratic | Washington Senate | 1993\n(age 43)\n | 1950\n |\n| 1\n | Washington\n | Maria Cantwell | Democratic | Washington House of Representatives, U.S. House of Representatives\n | 2001\n(age 43)\n | 1958\n |\n| 2\n | West Virginia\n | Shelley Moore Capito | Republican | West Virginia House of Delegates, U.S. House of Representatives\n | 2015\n(age 62)\n | 1953\n |\n| 1\n | Wisconsin\n | Tammy Baldwin | Democratic | Wisconsin State Assembly, U.S. House of Representatives\n | 2013\n(age 51)\n | 1962\n |\n| 2\n | Wyoming\n | Cynthia Lummis | Republican | Wyoming House of Representatives, Wyoming Senate, Wyoming Treasurer, U.S. House of Representatives\n | 2021\n(age 66)\n | 1954\n |\n\n\n## List of states represented by women[edit]\n\n\nThirty-three states have been represented by female senators.

afterward, rules were changed so that a senator has the right to bring a child under one year old on the Senate floor and breastfeed him or her during votes.[22] The day after those rules were changed, Maile became the first baby on the Senate floor when Duckworth brought her.[22][23]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Women in the United States House of Representatives\n* Widow's

Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \nOf the female senators who preceded Kassebaum:\nRebecca Latimer Felton, Rose McConnell Long, Dixie Bibb Graves, Vera C. Bushfield, Eva Bowring, Elaine S. Edwards, Muriel Humphrey, and Maryon Pittman Allen were all appointed and were never elected; Gladys Pyle (R-SD) and Hazel Abel (R-NE), were elected, but not to full terms (i.e., to complete terms where the previous senator had died or resigned, not to new six-year terms); Hattie Caraway and Maurine Brown Neuberger were both elected to full six-year terms, but their husbands had held the seat previously. Margaret Chase Smith's (R-ME) husband never served in the Senate, but he did serve in the House. When he died, Margaret won the ensuing election. Of the appointed senators, Long, Bushfield, Humphrey, and Allen were all appointed to fill out part of the terms of their deceased husbands, while Graves and Edwards were appointed by their husbands, the governor of their states at the time. However, Kassebaum's father was a former governor of Kansas, which means that the first woman to be elected to the Senate without any family connections was Paula Hawkins, who was elected in 1980 to represent Florida.\n2. **^** Bob Krueger and John F. Seymour, defeated by Kay Bailey Hutchison and Dianne Feinstein respectively, were appointed to the Senate by the governors of their states.\n3. **^** Latimer Felton was the oldest woman appointed to the Senate (at age 87)  \nShortest-serving woman in the Senate\n4. **^** Succeeded her late husband  \nFirst woman in the Senate to succeed her spouse  \nFirst woman re-elected to the Senate\n5. **^** Succeeded her late husband\n6. **^** Succeeded her late husband\n7. **^** Abel resigned 3 days before the end of her term, a common practice to give her successor seniority advantage.\n8. **^** Followed her late husband (although she did not directly succeed him)\n9. **^** Succeeded her late husband\n10. **^** Succeeded her late husband\n11. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Predecessor resigned early to give successor seniority advantage, so the senator was appointed for the few days prior to the commencement of the elected term\n12. **^** Succeeded her late husband\n13. **^** First non-Christian (Jewish) woman elected to the Senate\n14. **^** First African-American woman elected to the Senate\n15. **^** Lincoln was the first youngest woman to hold the distinction of \"youngest member of the Senate\" (at age 38)  \nLincoln was also the youngest woman elected to the Senate (at age 38)\n16. **^** Succeeded her father  \nFirst woman in the Senate to succeed a living parent\n17. **^** Married to Bob Dole\n18. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** When Kay Hagan defeated Elizabeth Dole, it was the first time in history a woman candidate defeated an incumbent woman.\n19. **^** First openly LGBT and lesbian woman elected to the Senate\n20. **^** First Asian-American woman elected to the Senate  \nFirst Japanese-American woman elected to the Senate  \nFirst Buddhist woman elected to the Senate\n21. **^** First Hispanic and Latina American woman elected to the Senate\n22. **^** First woman with a disability elected to the Senate  \nFirst Southeast Asian-American (Thai) woman elected to the Senate  \nFirst Amerasian or Eurasian woman elected to the Senate\n23. **^** First South Asian-American (Indian) woman elected to the Senate  \nFirst Jamaican American woman elected to the Senate  \nFirst woman of African-American and South Asian descent elected to the Senate\n24. **^** Blackburn was the oldest woman at the time of first election to the Senate (at 66 years and 5 months).\n25. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Sinema was elected as a Democrat in 2018, but switched to an independent in December 2022.\n26. **^** First openly LGBT woman of color appointed to the Senate  \nFirst LGBT African American woman appointed to the Senate\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Year of the Woman\". *U.S. Senate*.\n2. **^** \"Jewesses in politics represent!\".

It includes a list of all women who have served in the Senate, a list of current female senators, and a list of states represented by women in the Senate. The first female U.S. senator, Rebecca Latimer Felton, represented Georgia for a single day in 1922, and the first woman elected to the Senate, Hattie Caraway, was elected from Arkansas in 1932. Sixty women have served in the upper house of the United States Congress since its establishment in 1789. As of October 3, 2023, there are 25 women (15 Democrats, 9 Republicans, and 1 Independent) serving as U.S. senators.\n\n\nNancy Kassebaum is currently the oldest living former female member of the Senate at the age 91.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rebecca Latimer Felton (D-Georgia), the first female member of the United States Senate, who served for a single day in 1922.\n![](image)One woman (Barbara Mikulski) was reelected and four women were elected to the Senate in 1992, the \"Year of the Woman,\" Left to right: Senators Murray, Moseley Braun, Mikulski, Feinstein, and Boxer.\n![](image)By the 111th United States Congress (2009–2011), the number of women senators had increased to 17, including 4 Republicans and 13 Democrats\nFor its first 130 years in existence, the Senate's membership was entirely male. Until 1920, few women ran for the Senate. Until the 1990s, very few were elected. This paucity of women was due to many factors, including the lack of women's suffrage in many states until the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, women's limited access to higher education until the mid-1900s, public perceptions of gender roles, and barriers to women's advancement such as sex discrimination.\n\n\nThe first woman to serve in the U.S. Senate was Rebecca Latimer Felton; she represented Georgia for one day in 1922. Ten years later, Hattie Caraway became the first woman to win election to the Senate, representing Arkansas. In 1949, Margaret Chase Smith began her service in the Senate; she was the first woman to serve in both the House and Senate. Her 1960 reelection bid resulted in Chase Smith winning the nation's first-ever United States Senate election with two female major party nominees. In 1972, Elaine Edwards was appointed as the first Catholic woman in the Senate by her husband, the Governor of Louisiana, while she was Louisiana's First Lady; she retired after three months. In 1978, Muriel Humphrey Brown became the first and only Second Lady to serve in the United States Senate, after Hubert Humphrey's unexpected death in office. Humphrey Brown was appointed by the Governor of Minnesota to fill her late husband's Senate seat; she served for less than one year and did not seek to be elected to her husband's seat.\n\n\nIn 1978, Nancy Kassebaum became the first woman ever elected to a full term in the Senate, representing Kansas, without her husband having previously served in Congress.[n 1] Since 1978, there has always been at least one woman in the Senate. The first woman to be elected to the Senate without any family connections was Florida Republican Paula Hawkins, elected in 1980. She was also the first and, to date, only female member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints elected to the United States Senate. In 1990, there were still few women in the Senate as compared to the number of women in the House. The trend of few women in the Senate began to change in the wake of the Clarence Thomas Supreme Court nomination hearings and the subsequent election of the 103rd United States Congress in 1992, which was dubbed the \"Year of the Woman.\"[1] Barbara Mikulski was reelected and four new Democratic women were elected to the Senate. They were Patty Murray of Washington, Carol Moseley Braun of Illinois, Dianne Feinstein of California, and Barbara Boxer of California. Carol Moseley Braun was the first woman of color to serve in the Senate and the first woman to defeat an incumbent senator after she won the 1992 Democratic primary election over Alan Dixon. Later in 1992, Feinstein was the first woman to defeat an incumbent senator from a different party when she defeated John Seymour in a special election. Feinstein entered the Senate the same year as the first female Jewish senator.[2][3][4]\n\n\nBathroom facilities for women in the Senate on the Senate chamber level were first provided in 1992.[5] Women were not allowed to wear pants on the Senate floor until 1993.[6][7] In 1993, Senators Barbara Mikulski and Carol Moseley Braun wore pants onto the floor in defiance of the rule, and female support staff followed soon after, with the rule being amended later that year by Senate Sergeant-at-Arms Martha Pope to allow women to wear pants on the floor so long as they also wore a jacket.[6][7]\n\n\nThe first time two female senators from the same state served concurrently was beginning in 1993; Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer (both D-CA) were both elected in 1992, with Feinstein taking office that same year (as the result of a special election) and Boxer taking office in 1993; Boxer served until 2016, when she retired, and Feinstein was joined by Kamala Harris. In June 1993, Kay Bailey Hutchison won a special election in Texas, and joined Kassebaum as a fellow female Republican senator. These additions significantly diminished the popular perception of the Senate as an exclusive \"boys' club\". Since 1992, there has been at least one new woman elected to the Senate every two years, with the exception of 2004 (Lisa Murkowski was elected for the first time in 2004, but had been appointed to the seat since 2002). \n\n\n\n![](image)Eight Democratic women senators appear at the 2008 Democratic Convention in Denver. It has become a tradition at Democratic conventions for incumbent women senators to appear on opening night.Olympia Snowe of Maine arrived in the Senate in 1995, having previously served in the US House of Representatives and both houses of the Maine state legislature. She and later Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, and Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming are the only women to have served in both houses of a state legislature and both houses of the federal legislature. In 2000, Stabenow and Maria Cantwell became the first women to defeat incumbent *elected* senators in a general election, unseating Senators Spencer Abraham and Slade Gorton respectively.[n 2] Hillary Clinton is the first and only First Lady to run for or win a Senate seat. Clinton joined the Senate in 2001, becoming the first female senator from New York, and served until 2009, when she resigned to become the 67th United States Secretary of State, under President Barack Obama. She was replaced by Kirsten Gillibrand, who has been elected three times and was herself a candidate for president in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries.\n\n\nIn 2008, Kay Hagan became the first woman to unseat a female incumbent, Elizabeth Dole. Upon the opening of the 112th United States Congress in 2011, New Hampshire Democrat Jeanne Shaheen was joined by newly elected Republican Kelly Ayotte, making up the first Senate delegation of two women belonging to different parties.\n\n\nIn November 2022, Dianne Feinstein became the longest-serving female senator in history,[8] surpassing Barbara Mikulski,[9][10] having served for 30 years.[11] Feinstein was retiring at the end of her last term, scheduled for January 3, 2025,[12] but died on September 29, 2023, before her term ended.[13]\n\n\nIn 2012, a record five new female senators were elected. This beat the record of four new female senators from 1992 and set the record of five new women and eleven female senators in one Senate class. The five new women were Democrats Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and Republican Deb Fischer of Nebraska. Hirono was the first Asian-American woman and first Buddhist in the Senate, and Baldwin was the first openly gay person in the Senate.\n\n\nIn 2014, Joni Ernst was elected as the first female combat veteran to serve in the Senate. In 2016, Catherine Cortez Masto was elected as the first Latina senator, while Tammy Duckworth was elected as the first female double amputee in the Senate.[14] In a June 2016 primary election, as a result of California's recent establishment of the top-two primary, Attorney General of California Kamala Harris and U.S. Representative Loretta Sanchez became the first women of the same party to advance to a Senate general election. In November 2016, Harris became the first woman to defeat a woman of the same party in a Senate general election. \n\n\nIn 2016, Hillary Clinton became the first former female senator to win a major party's nomination for President of the United States. Despite winning a plurality of the popular vote, she ultimately lost her bid to Donald Trump.\n\n\nStarting in 2017, United States Senators Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, have held the distinction of being the first and second women elected as both the governor of a state and a United States senator from a state; both served as Governor of New Hampshire before their time in the Senate.\n\n\nIn 2018, Kyrsten Sinema defeated Martha McSally, becoming Arizona's first female senator, as well as the first openly bisexual senator from any state. Two weeks later, Arizona Governor Doug Ducey announced that he would appoint McSally to Arizona's other Senate seat, which was becoming vacant with the resignation of Jon Kyl. Sinema and McSally have been the only concurrently serving female senators to have previously faced off against each other in a Senate election. McSally exited the Senate in late 2020 after losing that year's special election to Mark Kelly, a Democrat.\n\n\nAlso in 2018, Jacky Rosen made political history as the first female one-term outgoing U.S. representative ever elected to the Senate.[15]\n\n\nIn 2023, Patty Murray became the first woman to serve as president pro tempore, a role traditionally given to the most senior member of the majority party in the United States Senate. Dianne Feinstein was the most senior Democratic senator, but declined to serve. This made Murray the third person in line to become president, after the vice president and the Speaker of the House.[16]\n\n\nSixty women have served in the United States Senate since its establishment in 1789.[17] Cumulatively, 36 female U.S. senators have been Democrats, while 23 have been Republicans and one is an independent. As of 2023, no female U.S. senator has ever won election to the House after her Senate term, resigned from a state governorship for the purpose of a Senate appointment by her successor, also won election as an independent or to represent more than one state in non-consecutive elections, served both seats of a state at different times, or represented a third party in her career. In December 2022, Senator Kyrsten Sinema became the first female senator to switch her party affiliation while in office. In September 2023, Senator Dianne Feinstein became the first female senator to die in office.\n\n\nSome female U.S. senators have later run for U.S. president or vice president—see list of female United States presidential and vice presidential candidates. In 2020, Kamala Harris became the first female senator, current or past, to win her vice presidential election bid and become the first female President of the United States Senate in American history.\n\n\n\n## Election, selection, and family[edit]\n\n\nBefore 2001, a plurality of women joined the U.S. Senate through appointment following the death or resignation of a husband or father who previously held the seat. An example is Muriel Humphrey (D-MN), the widow of former senator and Vice President Hubert Humphrey; she was appointed to fill his seat until a special election was held (in which she did not run). However, with the election of three women in 2000, the balance shifted; more women have now entered service as a senator by winning elections than by being appointed.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nRecent examples of selection include Jean Carnahan and Lisa Murkowski. In 2000, Jean Carnahan (D-MO) was appointed to fill the Senate seat won by her recently deceased husband, Mel Carnahan. Carnahan—even though dead—defeated the incumbent senator, John Ashcroft. Carnahan's widow was named to fill his seat by Missouri Governor Roger Wilson until a special election was held. However, she lost the subsequent 2002 election to fill out the rest of the six-year term. In 2002, Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) was appointed by her father Alaska Governor Frank Murkowski, who had resigned from the Senate to become governor, to serve the remaining two years of his term. Lisa Murkowski defeated former governor Tony Knowles in her retention bid in 2004.\n\n\nTwo recent members of the Senate brought with them a combination of name recognition resulting from the political careers of their famous husbands and their own substantial experience in public affairs. The first, former senator Elizabeth Dole (R-NC), was married to former Senate Majority Leader and 1996 Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole and served as Secretary of Transportation under President Ronald Reagan and Secretary of Labor under President George H.W. Bush; she later ran a losing bid for the Republican presidential nomination in 2000. The other, former senator Hillary Clinton (D-NY), wife of former President Bill Clinton, was First Lady of the United States and First Lady of Arkansas before taking her seat in 2000. She too ran an unsuccessful campaign for her party's presidential nomination in 2008; she resigned in 2009 to become the secretary of state for the eventual victor of that election, Barack Obama. In 2016, she ran a successful campaign for her party's presidential nomination, eventually losing in the general election to Republican nominee Donald Trump.\n\n\nAnother famous name is Nancy Landon Kassebaum (R-KS), the daughter of former Kansas governor and one-time presidential candidate Alf Landon. After retiring from the Senate, she married former senator Howard Baker (R-TN). Kassebaum has the distinction of being the first female elected senator who did not succeed her husband in Congress (Margaret Chase Smith was only elected to the Senate after succeeding her husband to his House seat).\n\n\nAmong the women elected or appointed in Senate history, by stature, Barbara Boxer (D-CA) and Barbara Mikulski (D-MD) are the shortest, at 4 feet 11 inches (1.50 m), whereas Kelly Loeffler (R-GA) is the tallest, at 5 feet 11 inches (1.80 m).[18][19][20]\n\n\n\n## List of female U.S. senators[edit]\n\n\n| Portrait\n | Name(lifespan) | State\n | Term\n | Entered by\n | Left for\n | Party\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Term start\n | Term end\n | Length ofservice (days)\n |\n| ![Sen.

This is the second-highest number of women to have served concurrently in the Senate in U.S. history. Fifteen are Democrats, nine are Republicans, and one is an independent.\n\n\nIn January 2019, four new women senators (Blackburn, McSally, Rosen, and Sinema) were seated although two others (Heitkamp and McCaskill) lost reelection bids, so the number of female senators reached 25, at the time with 17 being Democrats and 8 being Republicans. In January 2020, Kelly Loeffler was appointed to the Senate from Georgia, increasing the number of women in the Senate to 26, the highest proportion of women serving as U.S. senators in history.\n\n\nMartha McSally lost an election to finish John McCain's unexpired term on November 3, 2020, and left the Congress on December 2, which reduced the number of female senators to 25. On January 3, 2021, Cynthia Lummis, the first woman senator from Wyoming, began her term, so the number of female senators reached 26 once again. Meanwhile, Kamala Harris was elected Vice President of the United States; she resigned her Senate seat on January 18 in anticipation of the scheduled commencement of her term as Vice President (and thus President of the Senate) on January 20, which reduced the number of female senators to 25. In addition, Loeffler lost the January 5 special election runoff for the remainder of the term to which she had been appointed, and she left office also on January 20, which further reduced the number of women serving in the Senate to 24. On December 9, 2022, Sinema defected from the Democratic Party to become a registered independent, leaving 15 of her fellow women senators from her former party, and on January 3, 2023, Katie Britt, the first Republican woman senator from Alabama and also the first woman ever elected to the Senate from her state, began her term as well, increasing the number to 25 again. The death of Dianne Feinstein on September 29, 2023, brought the number back down to 24.

afterward, rules were changed so that a senator has the right to bring a child under one year old on the Senate floor and breastfeed him or her during votes.[22] The day after those rules were changed, Maile became the first baby on the Senate floor when Duckworth brought her.[22][23]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Women in the United States House of Representatives\n* Widow's

Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \nOf the female senators who preceded Kassebaum:\nRebecca Latimer Felton, Rose McConnell Long, Dixie Bibb Graves, Vera C. Bushfield, Eva Bowring, Elaine S. Edwards, Muriel Humphrey, and Maryon Pittman Allen were all appointed and were never elected; Gladys Pyle (R-SD) and Hazel Abel (R-NE), were elected, but not to full terms (i.e., to complete terms where the previous senator had died or resigned, not to new six-year terms); Hattie Caraway and Maurine Brown Neuberger were both elected to full six-year terms, but their husbands had held the seat previously. Margaret Chase Smith's (R-ME) husband never served in the Senate, but he did serve in the House. When he died, Margaret won the ensuing election. Of the appointed senators, Long, Bushfield, Humphrey, and Allen were all appointed to fill out part of the terms of their deceased husbands, while Graves and Edwards were appointed by their husbands, the governor of their states at the time. However, Kassebaum's father was a former governor of Kansas, which means that the first woman to be elected to the Senate without any family connections was Paula Hawkins, who was elected in 1980 to represent Florida.\n2. **^** Bob Krueger and John F. Seymour, defeated by Kay Bailey Hutchison and Dianne Feinstein respectively, were appointed to the Senate by the governors of their states.\n3. **^** Latimer Felton was the oldest woman appointed to the Senate (at age 87)  \nShortest-serving woman in the Senate\n4. **^** Succeeded her late husband  \nFirst woman in the Senate to succeed her spouse  \nFirst woman re-elected to the Senate\n5. **^** Succeeded her late husband\n6. **^** Succeeded her late husband\n7. **^** Abel resigned 3 days before the end of her term, a common practice to give her successor seniority advantage.\n8. **^** Followed her late husband (although she did not directly succeed him)\n9. **^** Succeeded her late husband\n10. **^** Succeeded her late husband\n11. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Predecessor resigned early to give successor seniority advantage, so the senator was appointed for the few days prior to the commencement of the elected term\n12. **^** Succeeded her late husband\n13. **^** First non-Christian (Jewish) woman elected to the Senate\n14. **^** First African-American woman elected to the Senate\n15. **^** Lincoln was the first youngest woman to hold the distinction of \"youngest member of the Senate\" (at age 38)  \nLincoln was also the youngest woman elected to the Senate (at age 38)\n16. **^** Succeeded her father  \nFirst woman in the Senate to succeed a living parent\n17. **^** Married to Bob Dole\n18. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** When Kay Hagan defeated Elizabeth Dole, it was the first time in history a woman candidate defeated an incumbent woman.\n19. **^** First openly LGBT and lesbian woman elected to the Senate\n20. **^** First Asian-American woman elected to the Senate  \nFirst Japanese-American woman elected to the Senate  \nFirst Buddhist woman elected to the Senate\n21. **^** First Hispanic and Latina American woman elected to the Senate\n22. **^** First woman with a disability elected to the Senate  \nFirst Southeast Asian-American (Thai) woman elected to the Senate  \nFirst Amerasian or Eurasian woman elected to the Senate\n23. **^** First South Asian-American (Indian) woman elected to the Senate  \nFirst Jamaican American woman elected to the Senate  \nFirst woman of African-American and South Asian descent elected to the Senate\n24. **^** Blackburn was the oldest woman at the time of first election to the Senate (at 66 years and 5 months).\n25. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Sinema was elected as a Democrat in 2018, but switched to an independent in December 2022.\n26. **^** First openly LGBT woman of color appointed to the Senate  \nFirst LGBT African American woman appointed to the Senate\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Year of the Woman\". *U.S. Senate*.\n2. **^** \"Jewesses in politics represent!\".

Loeffler was chief executive officer (CEO) of Bakkt, a subsidiary of commodity and financial service provider Intercontinental Exchange, of which her husband, Jeffrey Sprecher, is CEO. She is a former co-owner of the Atlanta Dream of the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA).[1] Loeffler is a member of the Republican Party.\n\n\nBrian Kemp, the Republican governor of Georgia, appointed Loeffler to the U.S. Senate in December 2019 after Senator Johnny Isakson resigned for health reasons. Loeffler ran in the 2020 Georgia U.S. Senate special election, seeking to hold the Senate seat until January 3, 2023. She finished second in the November 3 election, advancing to a runoff with Democrat Raphael Warnock held on January 5, 2021.[2] She lost the runoff election to Warnock. That same day, her fellow Georgia senator, David Perdue, also lost his bid for re-election. When Perdue's term ended on January 3, 2021, and he was succeeded by Jon Ossoff, Loeffler ascended to be the senior senator from Georgia, a position she held for just under three weeks, until Warnock was sworn in.\n\n\nLoeffler aligned with President Donald Trump, touting her \"100 percent Trump voting record\" during the campaign.[3][4]\n\n\nAfter the November 2020 election, Loeffler and Perdue claimed without evidence that there had been unspecified failures in the 2020 U.S. presidential election, and called for the resignation of Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who rejected the accusations. She later supported a lawsuit by Trump allies seeking to overturn the election results,[5] and also announced her intention to object to the certification of the Electoral College results in Congress.[6] After the attack on the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, Loeffler announced that she would withdraw her objection to the certification of the electoral votes and later voted to certify.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nLoeffler was born in Bloomington, Illinois, to Don and Lynda (née Munsell) Loeffler, and raised on her family's corn and soybean farm in Stanford, Illinois.[7][8] She has a brother, Brian.[9] In 1988, she graduated from Olympia High School in Stanford, where she was in the marching band, ran cross-country and track, and played varsity basketball.[10]\n\n\nIn 1992, Loeffler graduated with a Bachelor of Science in marketing from the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign's Gies College of Business, where she was a member of the Alpha Gamma Delta sorority.[11] After college, she worked for Toyota as a District Account Manager.[12][13] In 1999, Loeffler graduated with a Master of Business Administration (MBA) in international finance and marketing from DePaul University's Kellstadt Graduate School of Business.[8][11] She financed her graduate school tuition by mortgaging land inherited from her grandparents.[8]\n\n\n\n## Early career[edit]\n\n\nAfter earning her MBA, Loeffler worked for Citibank, William Blair & Company, and the Crossroads Group.[14] In 2002, she joined Intercontinental Exchange, a commodity and financial service provider, in investor relations.[15] She married the firm's CEO, Jeffrey Sprecher, in 2004.[8][16] Loeffler was eventually promoted to senior vice president of investor relations and corporate communications.[17] In 2018, she became the chief executive officer (CEO) of Bakkt, a subsidiary of Intercontinental Exchange.[18]\n\n\nIn 2010, Loeffler bought a minority stake in the Atlanta Dream of the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA).[8] In 2011, she and Mary Brock bought the team from Kathy Betty.[17][19] Loeffler took an active role in the team, arranging her travel schedule to attend all games and often meeting with head coach Michael Cooper during halftime to analyze the first half of the game.[20] In February 2021, Loeffler sold her stake in the team.[21]\n\n\nWhen Loeffler left Intercontinental Exchange to join the Senate, the company awarded her over $9 million of financial assets. A spokesperson for Loeffler said Loeffler \"left millions in equity compensation behind\" by joining the Senate.[22]\n\n\n\n### Political donations[edit]\n\n\nAccording to OpenSecrets, as of December 2019, Loeffler and her husband, Jeffrey Sprecher, had donated $3.2 million to political committees. Ninety-seven percent of these donations went to Republicans, and three percent to Democrats, including Hillary Clinton, Chris Dodd, Debbie Stabenow,[23] and Georgia Congressman David Scott (GA–13), who received $10,200.[23][24] Loeffler donated $750,000 to Restore Our Future, a super PAC supporting former Governor Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential campaign.[7] The National Republican Senatorial Committee received $247,500 from Loeffler and Sprecher.[24] In May 2020, Loeffler's husband gave $1 million to a Trump 2020 reelection super PAC, his largest federal political donation to date.[25][26]\n\n\n\n## United States Senator from Georgia (2020 - 2021)[edit]\n\n\n### Appointment[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Loeffler meeting with Mitch McConnell in December 2019\n![](image)Loeffler after being sworn in as Senator by President of the Senate Mike Pence\nLoeffler considered seeking the Republican nomination in the 2014 United States Senate election in Georgia but ultimately passed on the race because of Intercontinental Exchange's pending acquisition of the New York Stock Exchange.[27]\n\n\nOn August 28, 2019, sitting Georgia senator Johnny Isakson announced that he would resign at the end of the year, citing health reasons.[28] On December 4, 2019, in accordance with Georgia law, Governor Kemp appointed Loeffler to fill Isakson's unexpired term until the next regularly scheduled statewide election in November 2020.[29] Kemp traveled to Washington to explain why he wanted to appoint Loeffler instead of Trump's choice, Representative Doug Collins, who helped lead the House opposition to Trump's impeachment. The choice of Loeffler angered many Georgia conservatives who had supported Collins.[7][30][31][32]\n\n\nOn January 6, 2020, Loeffler was sworn into the Senate.[33] She became the second female to represent Georgia in the U.S. Senate. The first was Rebecca Latimer Felton, also the first female U.S. Senator, who served a symbolic one-day term in 1922.[34] The appointment was valid until the runoff election scheduled for January 5, because no candidate in the November 2020 election received a majority of the vote.[2]\n\n\n\n### Tenure and political positions[edit]\n\n\nLoeffler called herself the most conservative Republican in the Senate[35][36] and allied herself with President Trump.[35][37] During her tenure in the Senate, Loeffler sponsored 57 bills and cosponsored 210.[38] She voted in line with President Trump's stated position 80% of the time.[39][3]\n\n\nLoeffler supported Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act.[40] Loeffler opposed abortion and supported anti-abortion legislation.[41][42][43] The anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony List initially opposed Loeffler's appointment, but endorsed her in the 2020 election.[44][45][42] Loeffler donated portions of her Senate salary to anti-abortion pregnancy centers and an anti-LGBTQ adoption agency.[46]\n\n\nOn gun issues, Loeffler received \"A\" ratings from the NRA Political Victory Fund[47] and Gun Owners of America.[48] She cosponsored the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act and opposed the assault weapons ban and red flag law proposals. Loeffler supported constructing a border wall along the Mexico–United States border,[49] and the appointment of conservative judges to federal courts.[50] In September 2020, she introduced legislation to the Senate floor that would bar transgender girls and women from participating in girls' and women's sports.[51] The bill stated \"sex shall be recognized based solely on a person's reproductive biology and genetics at birth\".[52]\n\n\nIn February 2020, Loeffler said that \"Democrats have dangerously and intentionally misled the American people on #Coronavirus readiness\".[53] She went on to say that regarding COVID-19, \"Americans are in good hands with\" the Trump administration.[53] In March 2020, Loeffler said that the U.S. was \"in the best economic position\" to handle COVID-19.[53] She criticized Democrats, writing that they \"continue to play politics with\" COVID-19.[53]\n\n\nIn October 2020, shortly after Trump and First Lady Melania Trump were diagnosed with COVID-19 after attending events where they closely interacted with other individuals while maskless, Loeffler, who often appeared at rallies and gatherings without wearing a mask,[54] blamed their contraction of the disease on the People's Republic of China, tweeting, \"China gave this virus to our President @realDonaldTrump and First Lady @FLOTUS. WE MUST HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE.\"[55]\n\n\nDuring the 2021 United States Electoral College vote count in January 2021, Loeffler was slated to vote against the measure, but after the storming of the U.S. Capitol, which Loeffler witnessed, she changed her mind, saying, \"The events that transpired have forced me to reconsider. I cannot now in good conscience object to the certification of the votes.\"[56]\n\n\n\n### Committees[edit]\n\n\n* **Committee on Health Education Labor & Pensions**\n\t+ Subcommittee on Children and Families\n\t+ Subcommittee on Employment and Workplace Safety\n\t+ Primary Health and Retirement Security\n* **Joint Economic Committee**\n* **Committee on Veterans Affairs**\n* **Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, & Forestry**\n\t+ Conservation, Forestry, and Natural Resources\n\t+ Livestock, Marketing, and Agriculture Security\n\n\n#### COVID-19 insider trading investigation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2020 congressional insider trading scandal\n\nOn March 19, 2020, the release of federal financial disclosure documents showed that Loeffler and her husband Jeffrey Sprecher, chairman and CEO of the Intercontinental Exchange (a corporation that owns the New York Stock Exchange), had sold stock in companies vulnerable to the COVID-19 pandemic with an aggregate value of several million dollars. They began selling stocks on January 24, the same day Loeffler attended a private briefing of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor & Pensions on the spread of the disease, before the public had been alerted to its severity.[57] Loeffler denied any wrongdoing, saying the trades were made by a third-party advisor and that she learned about them only after they occurred.[58] Between January 24 and February 14, the couple sold between $1.275 and $3.1 million worth of stock in 27 companies, while buying stocks worth between $450,000 and $1 million, including in Citrix, which develops remote collaboration software.[59][60]\n\n\nThe government watchdog group Common Cause filed complaints with the Justice Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Senate Ethics Committee, alleging possible violations of the STOCK Act and insider trading laws in the matter of stock sales by Loeffler and three other senators, Richard Burr, Jim Inhofe, and Dianne Feinstein.[61] Loeffler and Sprecher had sold at least $18.7 million in Intercontinental Exchange stock before the 2020 stock market crash.[62] After being criticized for the trades, Loeffler and Sprecher sold their individual stocks in an effort \"to move beyond the distraction\" caused by trades they made before and during the market decline caused by the COVID-19 outbreak.[63] On May 26, 2020, the U.S. Department of Justice announced that it had closed its inquiry into Loeffler.[64] On June 16, 2020, the Senate Ethics Committee dismissed Common Cause's complaint, writing to Loeffler, \"Based on all the information before it, the Committee did not find evidence that your actions violated federal law, Senate Rules or standards of conduct.\"[65]\n\n\n\n![](image)Loeffler in 2020\n### 2020–2021 U.S. Senate special election[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2020–2021 United States Senate special election in Georgia\n\nLoeffler ran to serve the remaining two years of the Senate term to which she had been appointed. She planned to spend $20 million of her own money on her campaign.[66] Under Georgia's election law, all candidates for the seat (regardless of political party) compete in a nonpartisan blanket primary;[67] in addition to Democratic candidates, Loeffler, backed by the National Republican Senatorial Committee, was challenged by fellow Republican Doug Collins, who represented Georgia's 9th congressional district.[68]\n\n\nIn July 2020, Loeffler, who co-owned the Atlanta Dream, wrote the WNBA a public letter objecting to players wearing shirts with \"Black Lives Matter\" and \"Say Her Name\" printed on them, and suggesting they wear American flags instead.[69][70][71] She stated her opposition to the Black Lives Matter movement, saying it \"advocates things like defunding and abolishing the police, abolishing our military, emptying our prisons, destroying the nuclear family\" and \"promotes violence and antisemitism\".[72][71] Her comments led some WNBA players to call for her removal from ownership.[73] Loeffler later said that the movement was \"based on Marxist principles\" and threatens to \"destroy\" America.[74] In August 2020, players from the Dream and several other teams wore \"Vote Warnock\" T-shirts in support of one of Loeffler's Democratic challengers in the special election.[75][76]\n\n\nDuring her 2020 campaign, Loeffler said that she had never disagreed with Trump. When she was asked about the Donald Trump Access Hollywood tape, in which Trump discusses groping women, Loeffler replied that she was \"not familiar with that\".[77] When she was separately asked about a recording of Trump telling Bob Woodward that he was intentionally downplaying COVID-19 in public, she responded that it was \"fake news\".[78]\n\n\nDuring the 2020 campaign, Loeffler touted that she had been endorsed by Marjorie Taylor Greene, a controversial Republican who won the election for Georgia's 14th congressional district. Greene had a history of promotion of the QAnon conspiracy theory and of commentary that has been considered racist.[79][80][81] Asked whether she accepted Greene's endorsement given Greene's history of remarks, Loeffler said she knew nothing about QAnon and criticized the media for misrepresenting or faking events.[78]\n\n\nAs no candidate received over 50% of the vote in the election, Loeffler, who came in second, participated in a runoff election on January 5, 2021, against the primary's first-place finisher, Democratic candidate Raphael Warnock.[2][82][83] The other senate race from the state between David Perdue and Jon Ossoff also went to a runoff. This meant if Democrats won both seats, which they ultimately did, they would take control of the senate in a 50–50 tie, because of the Vice President Kamala Harris having a tie breaking vote. After the November election, Loeffler and the other U.S. Senator from Georgia, David Perdue, claimed without evidence that there had been \"failures\" in the election, and called for the resignation of the Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a fellow Republican. Their rhetoric fed into falsehoods and conspiracy theories among segments of the right, including Trump, who lost the presidential election to Joe Biden.[83][84][82] There was no evidence of wrongdoing in connection with the election.[83] Raffensperger rejected the calls for his resignation.[82] According to *Politico*, Loeffler repeated Trump's baseless claims of fraud because she wanted the support of Trump and his core voters in the January runoff.[85] In December 2020, Loeffler supported a lawsuit by Trump allies seeking to overturn the election results.[5]\n\n\nOn November 20, 2020, Loeffler spoke without a mask at a rally in Canton, Georgia, 46 days before the runoff. Later that day, she tested positive for COVID-19; the result of a subsequent test the following day was inconclusive. She had intermittently worn a mask while campaigning.[54] Attendees at her rallies were mostly maskless.[86] As a consequence of the initial positive test result, Loeffler canceled future appearances at rallies, entering quarantine for the recommended time period.[54] On January 1, 2021, Loeffler absented herself from the successful override of Trump's veto of the defense spending bill.[87]\n\n\nThroughout the campaign she sought to win the support of pro-Trump voters.[88] She touted her endorsement from Trump; he held a rally in the state shortly before the election.[89] At the rally, he asked his supporters to vote for Loeffler, also repeating debunked voter fraud allegations. Her campaign tried to paint her opponent Raphael Warnock as a socialist in a series of campaign ads, calling for people to vote for her to \"hold the line\" against what she called socialism. In a December 6, 2020, debate she repeatedly accused her opponent of being a \"radical liberal\" and refused to admit Joe Biden was the winner of the 2020 United States presidential election.[90] With Democrats in the race calling for $2,000 COVID-19 stimulus payments if they won and Donald Trump backing the policy, she announced she would back the payments.[91]\n\n\nThe Associated Press called the race for Warnock in the early morning hours of January 6.[92] His win was attributed to a large black voter turnout in the runoff.[92] That same day, Loeffler planned to object to the certification of the presidential election results, but after the storming of the United States Capitol, she withdrew her objection and accepted the results. The next day, Loeffler conceded to Warnock.[93]\n\n\n\n## Greater Georgia[edit]\n\n\nFollowing the special election, Loeffler founded Greater Georgia, an organization that planned to register likely conservative voters in Georgia, expand conservative messaging infrastructure, and advocate for changes to voting laws to increase election security.[94] Loeffler personally invested at least $1 million in the organization.[95]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nLoeffler is a Roman Catholic.[42]\n\n\nIn 2004, Loeffler married Jeffrey Sprecher, the founder and CEO of Intercontinental Exchange and Chairman of the New York Stock Exchange.[15] They live in Tuxedo Park, Atlanta,[96] in a $10.5 million, 15,000-square-foot (1,400 m2) estate, bought in 2013 in what was then the most expensive residential real estate transaction ever recorded in Atlanta.[13] They have four additional homes and a condo.[97] In November 2020, *Newsweek* reported Loeffler's and Sprecher's combined net worth at $800 million, making her the wealthiest sitting U.S. Senator at the time.[98][20]\n\n\nLoeffler used a Bombardier Challenger 300 private jet for her Senate work and political campaigning.[99]\n\n\n\n## Electoral history[edit]\n\n\n\n\nUnited States Senate special election in Georgia, November 3, 2020[100]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Democratic** | **Raphael Warnock**  | **1,617,035**  | **32.9%**  |  |\n|  | **Republican** | **Kelly Loeffler (incumbent)**  | **1,273,214**  | **25.9%**  |  |\n|  | Republican | Doug Collins | 980,454\n | 20.0%\n |  |\n|  | Democratic | Deborah Jackson\n | 324,118\n | 6.6%\n |  |\n|  | Democratic | Matt Lieberman\n | 136,021\n | 2.8%\n |  |\n|  | Democratic | Tamara Johnson-Shealey\n | 106,767\n | 2.2%\n |  |\n|  | Democratic | Jamesia James\n | 94,406\n | 1.9%\n |  |\n|  | Republican | Derrick Grayson\n | 51,592\n | 1.0%\n |  |\n|  | Democratic | Joy Felicia Slade\n | 44,945\n | 0.9%\n |  |\n|  | Republican | Annette Davis Jackson\n | 44,335\n | 0.9%\n |  |\n|  | Republican | Kandiss Taylor\n | 40,349\n | 0.8%\n |  |\n|  | Republican | A.

Loeffler was chief executive officer (CEO) of Bakkt, a subsidiary of commodity and financial service provider Intercontinental Exchange, of which her husband, Jeffrey Sprecher, is CEO. She is a former co-owner of the Atlanta Dream of the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA).[1] Loeffler is a member of the Republican Party.\n\n\nBrian Kemp, the Republican governor of Georgia, appointed Loeffler to the U.S. Senate in December 2019 after Senator Johnny Isakson resigned for health reasons. Loeffler ran in the 2020 Georgia U.S. Senate special election, seeking to hold the Senate seat until January 3, 2023. She finished second in the November 3 election, advancing to a runoff with Democrat Raphael Warnock held on January 5, 2021.[2] She lost the runoff election to Warnock. That same day, her fellow Georgia senator, David Perdue, also lost his bid for re-election. When Perdue's term ended on January 3, 2021, and he was succeeded by Jon Ossoff, Loeffler ascended to be the senior senator from Georgia, a position she held for just under three weeks, until Warnock was sworn in.\n\n\nLoeffler aligned with President Donald Trump, touting her \"100 percent Trump voting record\" during the campaign.[3][4]\n\n\nAfter the November 2020 election, Loeffler and Perdue claimed without evidence that there had been unspecified failures in the 2020 U.S. presidential election, and called for the resignation of Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who rejected the accusations. She later supported a lawsuit by Trump allies seeking to overturn the election results,[5] and also announced her intention to object to the certification of the Electoral College results in Congress.[6] After the attack on the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, Loeffler announced that she would withdraw her objection to the certification of the electoral votes and later voted to certify.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nLoeffler was born in Bloomington, Illinois, to Don and Lynda (née Munsell) Loeffler, and raised on her family's corn and soybean farm in Stanford, Illinois.[7][8] She has a brother, Brian.[9] In 1988, she graduated from Olympia High School in Stanford, where she was in the marching band, ran cross-country and track, and played varsity basketball.[10]\n\n\nIn 1992, Loeffler graduated with a Bachelor of Science in marketing from the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign's Gies College of Business, where she was a member of the Alpha Gamma Delta sorority.[11] After college, she worked for Toyota as a District Account Manager.[12][13] In 1999, Loeffler graduated with a Master of Business Administration (MBA) in international finance and marketing from DePaul University's Kellstadt Graduate School of Business.[8][11] She financed her graduate school tuition by mortgaging land inherited from her grandparents.[8]\n\n\n\n## Early career[edit]\n\n\nAfter earning her MBA, Loeffler worked for Citibank, William Blair & Company, and the Crossroads Group.[14] In 2002, she joined Intercontinental Exchange, a commodity and financial service provider, in investor relations.[15] She married the firm's CEO, Jeffrey Sprecher, in 2004.[8][16] Loeffler was eventually promoted to senior vice president of investor relations and corporate communications.[17] In 2018, she became the chief executive officer (CEO) of Bakkt, a subsidiary of Intercontinental Exchange.[18]\n\n\nIn 2010, Loeffler bought a minority stake in the Atlanta Dream of the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA).[8] In 2011, she and Mary Brock bought the team from Kathy Betty.[17][19] Loeffler took an active role in the team, arranging her travel schedule to attend all games and often meeting with head coach Michael Cooper during halftime to analyze the first half of the game.[20] In February 2021, Loeffler sold her stake in the team.[21]\n\n\nWhen Loeffler left Intercontinental Exchange to join the Senate, the company awarded her over $9 million of financial assets. A spokesperson for Loeffler said Loeffler \"left millions in equity compensation behind\" by joining the Senate.[22]\n\n\n\n### Political donations[edit]\n\n\nAccording to OpenSecrets, as of December 2019, Loeffler and her husband, Jeffrey Sprecher, had donated $3.2 million to political committees. Ninety-seven percent of these donations went to Republicans, and three percent to Democrats, including Hillary Clinton, Chris Dodd, Debbie Stabenow,[23] and Georgia Congressman David Scott (GA–13), who received $10,200.[23][24] Loeffler donated $750,000 to Restore Our Future, a super PAC supporting former Governor Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential campaign.[7] The National Republican Senatorial Committee received $247,500 from Loeffler and Sprecher.[24] In May 2020, Loeffler's husband gave $1 million to a Trump 2020 reelection super PAC, his largest federal political donation to date.[25][26]\n\n\n\n## United States Senator from Georgia (2020 - 2021)[edit]\n\n\n### Appointment[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Loeffler meeting with Mitch McConnell in December 2019\n![](image)Loeffler after being sworn in as Senator by President of the Senate Mike Pence\nLoeffler considered seeking the Republican nomination in the 2014 United States Senate election in Georgia but ultimately passed on the race because of Intercontinental Exchange's pending acquisition of the New York Stock Exchange.[27]\n\n\nOn August 28, 2019, sitting Georgia senator Johnny Isakson announced that he would resign at the end of the year, citing health reasons.[28] On December 4, 2019, in accordance with Georgia law, Governor Kemp appointed Loeffler to fill Isakson's unexpired term until the next regularly scheduled statewide election in November 2020.[29] Kemp traveled to Washington to explain why he wanted to appoint Loeffler instead of Trump's choice, Representative Doug Collins, who helped lead the House opposition to Trump's impeachment. The choice of Loeffler angered many Georgia conservatives who had supported Collins.[7][30][31][32]\n\n\nOn January 6, 2020, Loeffler was sworn into the Senate.[33] She became the second female to represent Georgia in the U.S. Senate. The first was Rebecca Latimer Felton, also the first female U.S. Senator, who served a symbolic one-day term in 1922.[34] The appointment was valid until the runoff election scheduled for January 5, because no candidate in the November 2020 election received a majority of the vote.[2]\n\n\n\n### Tenure and political positions[edit]\n\n\nLoeffler called herself the most conservative Republican in the Senate[35][36] and allied herself with President Trump.[35][37] During her tenure in the Senate, Loeffler sponsored 57 bills and cosponsored 210.[38] She voted in line with President Trump's stated position 80% of the time.[39][3]\n\n\nLoeffler supported Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act.[40] Loeffler opposed abortion and supported anti-abortion legislation.[41][42][43] The anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony List initially opposed Loeffler's appointment, but endorsed her in the 2020 election.[44][45][42] Loeffler donated portions of her Senate salary to anti-abortion pregnancy centers and an anti-LGBTQ adoption agency.[46]\n\n\nOn gun issues, Loeffler received \"A\" ratings from the NRA Political Victory Fund[47] and Gun Owners of America.[48] She cosponsored the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act and opposed the assault weapons ban and red flag law proposals. Loeffler supported constructing a border wall along the Mexico–United States border,[49] and the appointment of conservative judges to federal courts.[50] In September 2020, she introduced legislation to the Senate floor that would bar transgender girls and women from participating in girls' and women's sports.[51] The bill stated \"sex shall be recognized based solely on a person's reproductive biology and genetics at birth\".[52]\n\n\nIn February 2020, Loeffler said that \"Democrats have dangerously and intentionally misled the American people on #Coronavirus readiness\".[53] She went on to say that regarding COVID-19, \"Americans are in good hands with\" the Trump administration.[53] In March 2020, Loeffler said that the U.S. was \"in the best economic position\" to handle COVID-19.[53] She criticized Democrats, writing that they \"continue to play politics with\" COVID-19.[53]\n\n\nIn October 2020, shortly after Trump and First Lady Melania Trump were diagnosed with COVID-19 after attending events where they closely interacted with other individuals while maskless, Loeffler, who often appeared at rallies and gatherings without wearing a mask,[54] blamed their contraction of the disease on the People's Republic of China, tweeting, \"China gave this virus to our President @realDonaldTrump and First Lady @FLOTUS. WE MUST HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE.\"[55]\n\n\nDuring the 2021 United States Electoral College vote count in January 2021, Loeffler was slated to vote against the measure, but after the storming of the U.S. Capitol, which Loeffler witnessed, she changed her mind, saying, \"The events that transpired have forced me to reconsider. I cannot now in good conscience object to the certification of the votes.\"[56]\n\n\n\n### Committees[edit]\n\n\n* **Committee on Health Education Labor & Pensions**\n\t+ Subcommittee on Children and Families\n\t+ Subcommittee on Employment and Workplace Safety\n\t+ Primary Health and Retirement Security\n* **Joint Economic Committee**\n* **Committee on Veterans Affairs**\n* **Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, & Forestry**\n\t+ Conservation, Forestry, and Natural Resources\n\t+ Livestock, Marketing, and Agriculture Security\n\n\n#### COVID-19 insider trading investigation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2020 congressional insider trading scandal\n\nOn March 19, 2020, the release of federal financial disclosure documents showed that Loeffler and her husband Jeffrey Sprecher, chairman and CEO of the Intercontinental Exchange (a corporation that owns the New York Stock Exchange), had sold stock in companies vulnerable to the COVID-19 pandemic with an aggregate value of several million dollars. They began selling stocks on January 24, the same day Loeffler attended a private briefing of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor & Pensions on the spread of the disease, before the public had been alerted to its severity.[57] Loeffler denied any wrongdoing, saying the trades were made by a third-party advisor and that she learned about them only after they occurred.[58] Between January 24 and February 14, the couple sold between $1.275 and $3.1 million worth of stock in 27 companies, while buying stocks worth between $450,000 and $1 million, including in Citrix, which develops remote collaboration software.[59][60]\n\n\nThe government watchdog group Common Cause filed complaints with the Justice Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Senate Ethics Committee, alleging possible violations of the STOCK Act and insider trading laws in the matter of stock sales by Loeffler and three other senators, Richard Burr, Jim Inhofe, and Dianne Feinstein.[61] Loeffler and Sprecher had sold at least $18.7 million in Intercontinental Exchange stock before the 2020 stock market crash.[62] After being criticized for the trades, Loeffler and Sprecher sold their individual stocks in an effort \"to move beyond the distraction\" caused by trades they made before and during the market decline caused by the COVID-19 outbreak.[63] On May 26, 2020, the U.S. Department of Justice announced that it had closed its inquiry into Loeffler.[64] On June 16, 2020, the Senate Ethics Committee dismissed Common Cause's complaint, writing to Loeffler, \"Based on all the information before it, the Committee did not find evidence that your actions violated federal law, Senate Rules or standards of conduct.\"[65]\n\n\n\n![](image)Loeffler in 2020\n### 2020–2021 U.S. Senate special election[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2020–2021 United States Senate special election in Georgia\n\nLoeffler ran to serve the remaining two years of the Senate term to which she had been appointed. She planned to spend $20 million of her own money on her campaign.[66] Under Georgia's election law, all candidates for the seat (regardless of political party) compete in a nonpartisan blanket primary;[67] in addition to Democratic candidates, Loeffler, backed by the National Republican Senatorial Committee, was challenged by fellow Republican Doug Collins, who represented Georgia's 9th congressional district.[68]\n\n\nIn July 2020, Loeffler, who co-owned the Atlanta Dream, wrote the WNBA a public letter objecting to players wearing shirts with \"Black Lives Matter\" and \"Say Her Name\" printed on them, and suggesting they wear American flags instead.[69][70][71] She stated her opposition to the Black Lives Matter movement, saying it \"advocates things like defunding and abolishing the police, abolishing our military, emptying our prisons, destroying the nuclear family\" and \"promotes violence and antisemitism\".[72][71] Her comments led some WNBA players to call for her removal from ownership.[73] Loeffler later said that the movement was \"based on Marxist principles\" and threatens to \"destroy\" America.[74] In August 2020, players from the Dream and several other teams wore \"Vote Warnock\" T-shirts in support of one of Loeffler's Democratic challengers in the special election.[75][76]\n\n\nDuring her 2020 campaign, Loeffler said that she had never disagreed with Trump. When she was asked about the Donald Trump Access Hollywood tape, in which Trump discusses groping women, Loeffler replied that she was \"not familiar with that\".[77] When she was separately asked about a recording of Trump telling Bob Woodward that he was intentionally downplaying COVID-19 in public, she responded that it was \"fake news\".[78]\n\n\nDuring the 2020 campaign, Loeffler touted that she had been endorsed by Marjorie Taylor Greene, a controversial Republican who won the election for Georgia's 14th congressional district. Greene had a history of promotion of the QAnon conspiracy theory and of commentary that has been considered racist.[79][80][81] Asked whether she accepted Greene's endorsement given Greene's history of remarks, Loeffler said she knew nothing about QAnon and criticized the media for misrepresenting or faking events.[78]\n\n\nAs no candidate received over 50% of the vote in the election, Loeffler, who came in second, participated in a runoff election on January 5, 2021, against the primary's first-place finisher, Democratic candidate Raphael Warnock.[2][82][83] The other senate race from the state between David Perdue and Jon Ossoff also went to a runoff. This meant if Democrats won both seats, which they ultimately did, they would take control of the senate in a 50–50 tie, because of the Vice President Kamala Harris having a tie breaking vote. After the November election, Loeffler and the other U.S. Senator from Georgia, David Perdue, claimed without evidence that there had been \"failures\" in the election, and called for the resignation of the Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a fellow Republican. Their rhetoric fed into falsehoods and conspiracy theories among segments of the right, including Trump, who lost the presidential election to Joe Biden.[83][84][82] There was no evidence of wrongdoing in connection with the election.[83] Raffensperger rejected the calls for his resignation.[82] According to *Politico*, Loeffler repeated Trump's baseless claims of fraud because she wanted the support of Trump and his core voters in the January runoff.[85] In December 2020, Loeffler supported a lawsuit by Trump allies seeking to overturn the election results.[5]\n\n\nOn November 20, 2020, Loeffler spoke without a mask at a rally in Canton, Georgia, 46 days before the runoff. Later that day, she tested positive for COVID-19; the result of a subsequent test the following day was inconclusive. She had intermittently worn a mask while campaigning.[54] Attendees at her rallies were mostly maskless.[86] As a consequence of the initial positive test result, Loeffler canceled future appearances at rallies, entering quarantine for the recommended time period.[54] On January 1, 2021, Loeffler absented herself from the successful override of Trump's veto of the defense spending bill.[87]\n\n\nThroughout the campaign she sought to win the support of pro-Trump voters.[88] She touted her endorsement from Trump; he held a rally in the state shortly before the election.[89] At the rally, he asked his supporters to vote for Loeffler, also repeating debunked voter fraud allegations. Her campaign tried to paint her opponent Raphael Warnock as a socialist in a series of campaign ads, calling for people to vote for her to \"hold the line\" against what she called socialism. In a December 6, 2020, debate she repeatedly accused her opponent of being a \"radical liberal\" and refused to admit Joe Biden was the winner of the 2020 United States presidential election.[90] With Democrats in the race calling for $2,000 COVID-19 stimulus payments if they won and Donald Trump backing the policy, she announced she would back the payments.[91]\n\n\nThe Associated Press called the race for Warnock in the early morning hours of January 6.[92] His win was attributed to a large black voter turnout in the runoff.[92] That same day, Loeffler planned to object to the certification of the presidential election results, but after the storming of the United States Capitol, she withdrew her objection and accepted the results. The next day, Loeffler conceded to Warnock.[93]\n\n\n\n## Greater Georgia[edit]\n\n\nFollowing the special election, Loeffler founded Greater Georgia, an organization that planned to register likely conservative voters in Georgia, expand conservative messaging infrastructure, and advocate for changes to voting laws to increase election security.[94] Loeffler personally invested at least $1 million in the organization.[95]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nLoeffler is a Roman Catholic.[42]\n\n\nIn 2004, Loeffler married Jeffrey Sprecher, the founder and CEO of Intercontinental Exchange and Chairman of the New York Stock Exchange.[15] They live in Tuxedo Park, Atlanta,[96] in a $10.5 million, 15,000-square-foot (1,400 m2) estate, bought in 2013 in what was then the most expensive residential real estate transaction ever recorded in Atlanta.[13] They have four additional homes and a condo.[97] In November 2020, *Newsweek* reported Loeffler's and Sprecher's combined net worth at $800 million, making her the wealthiest sitting U.S. Senator at the time.[98][20]\n\n\nLoeffler used a Bombardier Challenger 300 private jet for her Senate work and political campaigning.[99]\n\n\n\n## Electoral history[edit]\n\n\n\n\nUnited States Senate special election in Georgia, November 3, 2020[100]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Democratic** | **Raphael Warnock**  | **1,617,035**  | **32.9%**  |  |\n|  | **Republican** | **Kelly Loeffler (incumbent)**  | **1,273,214**  | **25.9%**  |  |\n|  | Republican | Doug Collins | 980,454\n | 20.0%\n |  |\n|  | Democratic | Deborah Jackson\n | 324,118\n | 6.6%\n |  |\n|  | Democratic | Matt Lieberman\n | 136,021\n | 2.8%\n |  |\n|  | Democratic | Tamara Johnson-Shealey\n | 106,767\n | 2.2%\n |  |\n|  | Democratic | Jamesia James\n | 94,406\n | 1.9%\n |  |\n|  | Republican | Derrick Grayson\n | 51,592\n | 1.0%\n |  |\n|  | Democratic | Joy Felicia Slade\n | 44,945\n | 0.9%\n |  |\n|  | Republican | Annette Davis Jackson\n | 44,335\n | 0.9%\n |  |\n|  | Republican | Kandiss Taylor\n | 40,349\n | 0.8%\n |  |\n|  | Republican | A.

A member of the Republican Party, Lummis served as the U.S representative for Wyoming's at-large congressional district from 2009 to 2017. She served in the Wyoming House of Representatives from 1979 to 1983 and from 1985 to 1993, in the Wyoming Senate from 1993 to 1995, and as the Wyoming State Treasurer from 1999 to 2007.\n\n\nLummis was elected treasurer of Wyoming in 1998 and reelected without opposition in 2002. She chaired Mary Mead's gubernatorial campaign in 1990 and Ray Hunkins's gubernatorial campaign in 2006. She also served on Bob Dole's presidential steering committee in Wyoming and chaired Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential campaign in Wyoming.\n\n\nLummis unsuccessfully sought to be appointed to replace Senator Craig L. Thomas in 2007. She was elected to succeed Barbara Cubin in the U.S. House of Representatives in the 2008 election, defeating Democratic nominee Gary Trauner. During her tenure in the House, she was the first Wyoming representative to serve on the Agriculture Committee since 1941, chaired the Science Subcommittee on Energy, co-chaired the Congressional Caucus for Women's Issues, and was active in the Congressional Western Caucus and Freedom Caucus. She served until her retirement in 2017, and was succeeded by Liz Cheney. After her tenure in the House, Lummis sought a position in President Donald Trump's cabinet as Secretary of the Interior, but was not appointed. She was elected to the U.S. Senate in the 2020 election, becoming the first woman to represent Wyoming in the Senate. She voted to reject the certification of Pennsylvania's electoral votes in the 2020 presidential election, which were narrowly won by Joe Biden.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nCynthia Marie Lummis was born on September 10, 1954, in Cheyenne, Wyoming, to Doran Lummis and Enid Bennett. She is descended from German immigrants and her family first came to Wyoming in 1868. Her father chaired the Laramie County Republican Party and served on the county board of commissioners. Her brother Del Lummis also chaired the Laramie County Republican Party.[2][3][4][5]\n\n\nLummis attended Cheyenne East High School, and graduated from the University of Wyoming with a Bachelor of Science degree in animal science in 1976 and a Bachelor of Science in biology in 1978.[6][7][8] She graduated from the University of Wyoming with a Juris Doctor in 1985, and was on the dean's list.[9][10] She worked as a student teacher at Rock River School in 1977.[11]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### State legislature[edit]\n\n\n#### Elections[edit]\n\n\nIn 1978, Lummis was elected to the Wyoming House of Representatives at age 24, the youngest woman to serve in the state legislature.[12][13] She was reelected in 1980, but chose to not seek reelection in 1982.[14][15] Lummis returned to the state house after winning the 1984 election.[16][17] She filed to run for reelection on June 19, 1986, and was reelected after placing third out of 18 candidates.[18][19][20] She was reelected in the 1988 and 1990 elections.[21][22] She was reapportioned to the 8th district in 1992.[23]\n\n\nIn 1990, when Republican Senator Dan Sullivan resigned from the Wyoming Senate, Senate Majority Leader Diemer True stated that Lummis was qualified to replace Sullivan in the state senate. But she could not take the position, as she was busy serving as a campaign manager in the gubernatorial election.[24] In 1992, Lummis ran for a seat in the Wyoming Senate from the 5th district, defeating Norman P. Feagler for the Republican nomination, and incumbent Democratic Senator Harriet Elizabeth Byrd in the general election.[25][26][27] During the campaign Lummis spent $11,661, making her the fifth-highest spending elected candidate in the 1992 election.[28] On June 8, 1994, she announced that she would not run for reelection, saying she had other commitments to her family. Republican nominee Don Lawler was elected to succeed her after defeating Democratic nominee Steve Freudenthal.[29][30]\n\n\n\n#### Tenure[edit]\n\n\nDuring Lummis's tenure in the state house, she chaired the Revenue committee and served on the Judiciary and Agriculture Committees.[31][12][32] During her tenure in the state senate she served on the Judiciary Committee.[33] After leaving the state legislature, she was appointed to Jim Geringer's gubernatorial transition team, and served as his general counsel until 1997.[34][35][36] Geringer appointed Lummis to serve as interim director of the Office of State Lands and Investments in 1997, after he fired Jim Magagna.[37]\n\n\nOn February 28, 1982, Lummis was injured in a car accident while Wiederspahn was driving.[38] She attended the National Conference of State Legislatures national conference in 1982, alongside Senate President Donald Cundall and Representatives Wiederspahn, Peg Shreve, Scott Ratliff, William A. Cross, and George Salisbury.[39] In a 1982 roll-call vote in favor of legislation about the treatment of non-resident traffic offenders, a man cast Lummis's vote while she was outside the room. Lummis changed the vote to a nay after coming back in, and Representative Ken Burns cited this as an example of why electronic voting was needed.[40]\n\n\nDuring the 1988 Republican presidential primaries, Lummis served on Bob Dole's steering committee in Wyoming.[41] A 1989 survey of the financial contributors of the Wyoming Republican Party showed that Lummis was suggested as a candidate for Secretary of State of Wyoming.[42] She served as Republican candidate Mary Mead's campaign manager during the 1990 gubernatorial election.[43]\n\n\n\n### Treasurer[edit]\n\n\n#### Elections[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Results of the 1998 Wyoming Treasurer election   \n**Lummis**: Lummis—50–60%\n Lummis—60–70%\n Lummis—70–80%\n   \n**Loveridge**: Loveridge—50–60%\n\nOn November 17, 1996, incumbent Treasurer Stan Smith announced that he would not seek reelection to a fifth term in 1998. It was speculated that Lummis would replace him.[44] At the Laramie County Republican convention on March 28, 1998, she announced that she would run for treasurer, and formally announced her campaign on April 20, at a press conference alongside Smith.[45][46]\n\n\nDuring the campaign, the Attorney General ruled that public funds could not be used to send state treasurer candidates to an investment seminar.[47] Lummis won the Republican nomination without opposition and defeated Democratic nominee Charyl Loveridge and Libertarian nominee James Blomquist.[48][49]\n\n\nLummis was considered as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination in the 2002 gubernatorial election, but declined to run.[50][51] She announced on April 30 that she would seek reelection as treasurer, and was reelected without opposition in 2002.[52][53][54] Lummis was the only statewide candidate to face no opposition in the 2002 election, as nobody had filed to run in the Democratic primary and no other candidate received the 25 write-in votes required to qualify for the nomination.[55][56] During the campaign she had raised $9,275 and spent $12,151.[57]\n\n\nShe was limited to two terms as treasurer and did not challenge the constitutionality of the legislation, despite the Wyoming Supreme Court having invalidated term limits on state legislators.[58] She endorsed former Speaker Fred Parady to succeed her as treasurer in the 2006 election, but Joseph Meyer won the Republican primary and the general election.[59][60][61]\n\n\n\n#### Tenure[edit]\n\n\nLummis conducted an accounting change by raising the interest rate on the $100 million in Wyoming banks, which reduced Wyoming's expected budget deficit in 1999 by over $5 million.[62] She also planned a 1% increase on the interest yield of Wyoming's $2.6 billion permanent fund, which would raise $26 million per year.[63] She served on the Wyoming Board of Land Commissioners alongside Governor Geringer, Secretary of State Meyer, Auditor Max Maxfield, and superintendent of public instruction Judy Catchpole.[64][65] During her tenure, the Permanent Mineral Trust Fund rose to over $2 billion for the first time.[66]\n\n\nIn April 2001, Lummis announced a conflict of interest involving her role as treasurer of the Arp and Hammond Hardware Company, which she claimed had existed since December 2000 but had existed since April 2000.[67] She and other Republican statewide officials were accused of trying to expand their powers at the expense of Governor Dave Freudenthal, but denied the claims.[68] Lummis claimed that she was the person responsible for the increase in Wyoming's investments during her tenure as treasurer, but Freudenthal said that no one person could take credit for the increase.[69]\n\n\nAs a member of the Wyoming Canvassing Board, Lummis voted unanimously alongside the three other members against a recall of the ballots cast in Natrona County during the 2002 United States House of Representatives election. Even though the results in Natrona County could not overturn the statewide results, they would determine which county was placed first on the ballot. Lummis initially supported a recount, but changed her mind after Mary Ann Collins, the Natrona County Clerk, told her that all of the ballots had been counted.[70]\n\n\nLummis and all other statewide officials in Wyoming attended the first inauguration of George W. Bush. During the 2004 presidential election, she served as one of Wyoming's 28 delegates to the Republican National Convention. Lummis was the only statewide official from Wyoming to attended Bush's second inauguration.[71][72] She served as the chair of Ray Hunkins's campaign during the 2006 gubernatorial election.[73]\n\n\n\n### United States House of Representatives[edit]\n\n\n#### Elections[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Results of the 2008 United States House of Representatives election in Wyoming   \n**Lummis**: Lummis—50–60%\n Lummis—60–70%\n Lummis—70–80%\n   \n**Trauner**: Trauner—40–50%\n Trauner—50–60%\n Trauner—60–70%\n\n![](image)Cynthia Lummis in 2009\n![](image)Cynthia Lummis with representatives Eric Cantor and Mary Fallin\nRepresentative Barbara Cubin, whom Lummis had supported during the 1994 election, announced that she would not run for reelection in the 2008 election.[74][75] On January 2, 2008, Lummis announced that she would run for Cubin's seat, winning the Republican nomination against Mark Gordon, Bill Winney, and Michael Holland, having challenged them to debates held in all 23 Wyoming counties during the primaries.[76][77][78] A poll conducted from January 18 to 21 showed that Lummis had a favorability rating of 29%, unfavorability rating of 17%, a neutral rating of 24%, and 30% did not recognize her.[79] Tucker Fagan, who later served as her chief of staff, served as Lummis's campaign manager. During the campaign Rachael Seidenschnur, her press secretary, resigned after using a fake name to ask Lummis's opponent a question.[80][81][82] She defeated Democratic nominee Gary Trauner in the general election.[83] During the campaign Lummis raised $1,557,313 and spent $1,543,875 while Trauner raised $1,672,707 and spent $1,716,013.[84][85]\n\n\nLummis was reelected in 2010 against Democratic nominee David Wendt and Libertarian nominee John V. Love, after having raised $780,426 and spending $754,270 compared to Wendt, who had raised $65,709 and spent $68,523[86][87][88][89] Lummis announced that she would run for reelection on May 21, 2012, and was reelected in the 2012 election over Democratic nominee Chris Henrichsen after having raised $715,314 and spent $631,026.[90][91][92][93] She was reelected in the 2014 election against Democratic nominee Richard Grayson after having raised $432,666 and spent $300,949.[94][95][96]\n\n\nOn November 12, 2015, Lummis announced that she would not seek reelection in the 2016 election, and Liz Cheney was elected to succeed her.[97][98] Lummis's daughter, Annaliese Wiederspahn, served as Leland Christensen's campaign manager during the Republican primary.[99] Lummis considered running for the Republican nomination in the 2018 gubernatorial election, but declined to run and endorsed Sam Galeotos.[100][101] She sought a position in President Donald Trump's cabinet by attempting to replace Ryan Zinke as United States Secretary of the Interior, but David Bernhardt was appointed instead.[102][103]\n\n\n\n#### Tenure[edit]\n\n\nDuring Lummis's tenure in the House, she served on the Agriculture and Appropriations Committees and on the Energy and Mineral Resources, National Parks, Forests and Public Lands, and Energy and Water Development Subcommittees. She was the first representative from Wyoming to serve on the Agriculture Committee since Frank O. Horton, who served on the committee from 1939 to 1941.[104][105][106][107] In 2011, she was appointed vice chair of the Appropriations Subcommittee of the Agriculture Committee.[108] Lummis left the Appropriations Committee in 2013, saying she had requested her removal from the committee and that it was not part of a purge of radical Republicans from committee positions.[109] She was appointed chair of the Science Subcommittee on Energy in 2013.[110]\n\n\nLummis served as the communications chair and spokesperson of the Congressional Western Caucus and succeeded Dean Heller as vice chair in 2011 following Heller's appointment to the United States Senate.[111][112][113] Lummis was elected to serve on the House Republican Steering Committee in 2010.[106] She was at one point the only female member of the Freedom Caucus and the last until the election of Debbie Lesko.[114][115] Lummis co-chaired the Congressional Caucus for Women's Issues alongside Representative Gwen Moore from 2011 to 2013.[116] She was also a member of the Tea Party Caucus.[117]\n\n\nLummis supported Speaker John Boehner while the Freedom Caucus successfully pushed to remove Boehner.[118] She praised the election of Paul Ryan as Speaker, saying, \"we have ushered in thoughtful, conservative leadership, restored member-driven policy-making to the legislative process and returned regular order that will bring sunshine to back rooms making government work better\".[119]\n\n\nLummis served on the Republican whip team until she was removed from the position in 2015, for voting against giving President Barack Obama the authority to propose a trade agreement with Pacific countries. She said she knew she would be removed from her position on the whip team for her vote but did not regret it. Representatives Steve Pearce and Trent Franks were also removed from the whip team for their votes.[120]\n\n\nDuring the 2008 presidential election, Lummis was supposed to give a speech at the Republican National Convention on the first day, but her speech was canceled due to Hurricane Gustav.[121] During the 2012 Republican presidential primaries she endorsed Mitt Romney and served as the chair of Romney's campaign in Wyoming.[122][123] During the 2016 Republican presidential primaries, she was a campaign surrogate for Rand Paul, and later endorsed Trump in the presidential election.[124][125]\n\n\n\n### United States Senate[edit]\n\n\n#### Elections[edit]\n\n\nAfter Senator Craig L. Thomas died on June 4, 2007, Lummis announced on June 12 that she would seek an appointment to replace him.[126] She placed third in the final vote, making her one of the nominees submitted to the governor as a candidate for appointment, alongside John Barrasso and Tom Sansonetti.[127][128] Freudenthal selected Barrasso to replace Thomas.[129] Lummis was speculated as a possible candidate in the 2014 United States Senate election.[130]\n\n\nOn June 20, 2019, Lummis filed to run for a seat in the United States Senate to succeed retiring Senator Mike Enzi.[131] She won the Republican nomination and defeated Democratic nominee Merav Ben-David in the general election.[132][133] Her victory made her the first woman to represent Wyoming in the United States Senate.[134] She raised more during the campaign than all of her Republican and Democratic opponents combined.[135] During the campaign Lummis raised $3,003,788 and spent $3,037,813 while Ben-David raised $559,626 and spent $545,348.[136][137]\n\n\n\n#### Tenure[edit]\n\n\nDuring her tenure in the Senate, Lummis has served on the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, Environment and Public Works, and Commerce, Science, and Transportation committees.[138] Hans Hunt, a member of the Wyoming state House, resigned so that he could work as Lummis's agriculture and trade policy adviser.[139]\n\n\nDuring the counting of the electoral college vote of the 2020 presidential election Lummis voted to certify the results from Arizona, but against certifying the results from Pennsylvania.[140][141] She voted to acquit Trump during his second impeachment trial.[142]\n\n\nLummis voted against the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 but for the PPP Extension Act and the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act.[143][144][145]\n\n\n\n## Political positions[edit]\n\n\n### Economy[edit]\n\n\nLummis supported the federal takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, but said the government should avoid bailing out private companies.[146] She supported the privatization of Social Security, raising the age at which people received Social Security money, and making the Bush tax cuts permanent.[147][148][149] She voted against the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.[150]\n\n\nIn 2010, the House voted 228 to 192, with Lummis in favor, to prohibit federal funding for NPR.[151] She said that House Democrats had a \"cocaine-like addiction\" to spending.[152] Lummis voted against the Hurricane Sandy relief bill, saying that although victims of Hurricane Sandy deserved the money the federal government should cut its budget to offset the cost of the legislation.[153]\n\n\nLummis has campaigned for a regulatory framework for digital assets, a stance she reiterated after the FTX exchange collapsed.[154][155]\n\n\nLummis was among the 31 Senate Republicans who voted against final passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023.[156]\n\n\n\n### Energy and climate change[edit]\n\n\nIn a 2012 campaign debate, Lummis rejected the scientific consensus on climate change, claiming that climate change was \"not settled science\".[110] She supports the development of nuclear power and oil drilling in Alaska.[157]\n\n\n\n### Equality[edit]\n\n\nIn 1979, Lummis said that it was \"important to me to see Equal Rights Amendment not rescinded\".[12] In 2015, she and Representative Carolyn Maloney led another effort to pass the ERA.[158] In 2013, the House voted 286 to 138, with Lummis against, to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act.[159] She and Senator Chris Van Hollen attempted to have a federal building in Cheyenne named after Louisa Swain, the first woman to vote in the United States.[160]\n\n\n\n### LGBT rights[edit]\n\n\nLummis voted against the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, named after Matthew Shepard, who was murdered in an anti-gay hate crime, stating that she believed that hate crime legislation was \"a state's rights issue\".[161][162] She voted against the repeal of don't ask, don't tell and co-sponsored the State Marriage Defense Act.[163] Following the Supreme Court ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges, which found same-sex marriage bans unconstitutional, Lummis supported the First Amendment Defense Act to protect religious groups that opposed gay marriage.[164] She opposes same-sex marriage and believes that it \"should be left to the states\".[165] She was given a zero percent rating from the Human Rights Campaign during her entire tenure in the House of Representatives.[166][167][168][169] She was one of 12 Republicans to vote to advance the Respect for Marriage Act, legislation that codifies same-sex marriage rights into federal law.[170] On November 29, 2022, Lummis voted for the final passage of the Respect for Marriage Act.[171][172][173] Explaining her decision, reversing her prior opposition to federal same-sex marriage recognition, she said she was \"guided by two things—the Wyoming Constitution and ensuring religious liberties for all citizens and faith-based organizations were protected.\"[174][175]\n\n\n\n### Foreign policy[edit]\n\n\nLummis supported continuing the United States' occupation of Iraq, holding that soldiers should not be withdrawn until General David Petraeus said it was time to leave. She supported the surge of soldiers in Iraq.[176] Lummis was one of four Republicans on the Agriculture Committee to vote in favor of legislation that would have lifted the travel ban on Americans and agricultural products to and from Cuba.[177] Lummis opposed American involvement in the Syrian civil war, stating that the civil war \"should be dealt with by the Arab world\" and that she did not see how \"getting involved in another open-ended and costly conflict is in the best interest of America\".[178][179]\n\n\n\n### Firearms[edit]\n\n\nLummis received an \"A\" rating and endorsement from the NRA Political Victory Fund during the 2008 campaign.[180][181] In 2009, the House voted 279 to 147, with Lummis in favor, to allow people to bring loaded guns into national parks and wildlife refuges.[182]\n\n\n\n### Health care legislation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Cynthia Lummis in 2011\nLummis supported the creation of federal legislation to allow private insurance companies to form interstate insurance pools.[183] She voted against passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2009,[184] and has supported subsequent efforts to defund the ACA.[185]\n\n\nLummis and 182 other Republican members of Congress filed an amicus brief asking the Supreme Court to halt a COVID-19 vaccination mandate for companies with 100 or more employees.[186] During the COVID-19 pandemic, she opposed adding unruly passengers to the \"no-fly\" list, saying that unruly passengers who refuse to comply with mask requirements are not the same as terrorists.[187]\n\n\nLummis co-sponsored legislation in the state house to allow state Medicaid funding to be used for abortions when the mother's life was at risk.[188] The Wyoming \"Right to Choose\" political action committee reported that Lummis was pro-choice after she completed a questionnaire during the 1990 election and the organization endorsed her during the 1992 election.[189][190] Lummis said in the 1990s that abortion was a sin, but that it should not be illegal, because people can better evaluate their circumstances than the state.[191]\n\n\nIn 2015, Lummis cosponsored and voted for legislation in the House to defund Planned Parenthood.[192] The National Right to Life Committee endorsed her in the 2020 election and gave her a 100% anti-abortion rating during her tenure in the U.S. House of Representatives. She supported the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act.[193] Lummis was given a 0% rating by NARAL Pro-Choice America in 2016.[194]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nLummis met Alvin Wiederspahn while both were campaigning during the 1978 election; they married on May 28, 1983. Both later served in the Wyoming House of Representatives, one of the few married couples to do so, though Lummis is a Republican and Wiederspahn was a Democrat.[195][196][197] She remained married to Wiederspahn, with whom she had one child, until his death on October 24, 2014.[198]\n\n\nLummis has a net worth of $12.26 million as of 2015, but reported a net worth between $20 million and $75 million from 2007 to 2008.[199][200] She purchased Bitcoin in 2013 on her son-in-law's advice and became the first U.S. senator to own cryptocurrency.[201] Her enthusiasm for the technology led to her being known as Congress's \"Crypto Queen\".[202] Lummis owned at least $230,000 worth of Bitcoin in 2021.[203] She is a Lutheran and adheres to the Lutheran Church – Missouri Synod (LCMS).[204]\n\n\n\n## Electoral history[edit]\n\n\n\n\n1986 Wyoming House of Representatives Laramie County Republican primary[19]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Republican** | **Cynthia Lummis (incumbent)**  | **6,837**  | **15.54%**  |  |\n|  | **Republican** | **Ellen Crowley**  | **6,521**  | **14.82%**  |  |\n|  | **Republican** | **Bill McIlvain**  | **6,338**  | **14.40%**  |  |\n|  | **Republican** | **April Brimmer Kunz**  | **6,173**  | **14.03%**  |  |\n|  | **Republican** | **Gary Yordy**  | **5,682**  | **12.91%**  |  |\n|  | **Republican** | **Mary Jean McDowell Baker**  | **4,480**  | **10.18%**  |  |\n|  | **Republican** | **Ronald G.

A member of the Republican Party, Lummis served as the U.S representative for Wyoming's at-large congressional district from 2009 to 2017. She served in the Wyoming House of Representatives from 1979 to 1983 and from 1985 to 1993, in the Wyoming Senate from 1993 to 1995, and as the Wyoming State Treasurer from 1999 to 2007.\n\n\nLummis was elected treasurer of Wyoming in 1998 and reelected without opposition in 2002. She chaired Mary Mead's gubernatorial campaign in 1990 and Ray Hunkins's gubernatorial campaign in 2006. She also served on Bob Dole's presidential steering committee in Wyoming and chaired Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential campaign in Wyoming.\n\n\nLummis unsuccessfully sought to be appointed to replace Senator Craig L. Thomas in 2007. She was elected to succeed Barbara Cubin in the U.S. House of Representatives in the 2008 election, defeating Democratic nominee Gary Trauner. During her tenure in the House, she was the first Wyoming representative to serve on the Agriculture Committee since 1941, chaired the Science Subcommittee on Energy, co-chaired the Congressional Caucus for Women's Issues, and was active in the Congressional Western Caucus and Freedom Caucus. She served until her retirement in 2017, and was succeeded by Liz Cheney. After her tenure in the House, Lummis sought a position in President Donald Trump's cabinet as Secretary of the Interior, but was not appointed. She was elected to the U.S. Senate in the 2020 election, becoming the first woman to represent Wyoming in the Senate. She voted to reject the certification of Pennsylvania's electoral votes in the 2020 presidential election, which were narrowly won by Joe Biden.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nCynthia Marie Lummis was born on September 10, 1954, in Cheyenne, Wyoming, to Doran Lummis and Enid Bennett. She is descended from German immigrants and her family first came to Wyoming in 1868. Her father chaired the Laramie County Republican Party and served on the county board of commissioners. Her brother Del Lummis also chaired the Laramie County Republican Party.[2][3][4][5]\n\n\nLummis attended Cheyenne East High School, and graduated from the University of Wyoming with a Bachelor of Science degree in animal science in 1976 and a Bachelor of Science in biology in 1978.[6][7][8] She graduated from the University of Wyoming with a Juris Doctor in 1985, and was on the dean's list.[9][10] She worked as a student teacher at Rock River School in 1977.[11]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### State legislature[edit]\n\n\n#### Elections[edit]\n\n\nIn 1978, Lummis was elected to the Wyoming House of Representatives at age 24, the youngest woman to serve in the state legislature.[12][13] She was reelected in 1980, but chose to not seek reelection in 1982.[14][15] Lummis returned to the state house after winning the 1984 election.[16][17] She filed to run for reelection on June 19, 1986, and was reelected after placing third out of 18 candidates.[18][19][20] She was reelected in the 1988 and 1990 elections.[21][22] She was reapportioned to the 8th district in 1992.[23]\n\n\nIn 1990, when Republican Senator Dan Sullivan resigned from the Wyoming Senate, Senate Majority Leader Diemer True stated that Lummis was qualified to replace Sullivan in the state senate. But she could not take the position, as she was busy serving as a campaign manager in the gubernatorial election.[24] In 1992, Lummis ran for a seat in the Wyoming Senate from the 5th district, defeating Norman P. Feagler for the Republican nomination, and incumbent Democratic Senator Harriet Elizabeth Byrd in the general election.[25][26][27] During the campaign Lummis spent $11,661, making her the fifth-highest spending elected candidate in the 1992 election.[28] On June 8, 1994, she announced that she would not run for reelection, saying she had other commitments to her family. Republican nominee Don Lawler was elected to succeed her after defeating Democratic nominee Steve Freudenthal.[29][30]\n\n\n\n#### Tenure[edit]\n\n\nDuring Lummis's tenure in the state house, she chaired the Revenue committee and served on the Judiciary and Agriculture Committees.[31][12][32] During her tenure in the state senate she served on the Judiciary Committee.[33] After leaving the state legislature, she was appointed to Jim Geringer's gubernatorial transition team, and served as his general counsel until 1997.[34][35][36] Geringer appointed Lummis to serve as interim director of the Office of State Lands and Investments in 1997, after he fired Jim Magagna.[37]\n\n\nOn February 28, 1982, Lummis was injured in a car accident while Wiederspahn was driving.[38] She attended the National Conference of State Legislatures national conference in 1982, alongside Senate President Donald Cundall and Representatives Wiederspahn, Peg Shreve, Scott Ratliff, William A. Cross, and George Salisbury.[39] In a 1982 roll-call vote in favor of legislation about the treatment of non-resident traffic offenders, a man cast Lummis's vote while she was outside the room. Lummis changed the vote to a nay after coming back in, and Representative Ken Burns cited this as an example of why electronic voting was needed.[40]\n\n\nDuring the 1988 Republican presidential primaries, Lummis served on Bob Dole's steering committee in Wyoming.[41] A 1989 survey of the financial contributors of the Wyoming Republican Party showed that Lummis was suggested as a candidate for Secretary of State of Wyoming.[42] She served as Republican candidate Mary Mead's campaign manager during the 1990 gubernatorial election.[43]\n\n\n\n### Treasurer[edit]\n\n\n#### Elections[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Results of the 1998 Wyoming Treasurer election   \n**Lummis**: Lummis—50–60%\n Lummis—60–70%\n Lummis—70–80%\n   \n**Loveridge**: Loveridge—50–60%\n\nOn November 17, 1996, incumbent Treasurer Stan Smith announced that he would not seek reelection to a fifth term in 1998. It was speculated that Lummis would replace him.[44] At the Laramie County Republican convention on March 28, 1998, she announced that she would run for treasurer, and formally announced her campaign on April 20, at a press conference alongside Smith.[45][46]\n\n\nDuring the campaign, the Attorney General ruled that public funds could not be used to send state treasurer candidates to an investment seminar.[47] Lummis won the Republican nomination without opposition and defeated Democratic nominee Charyl Loveridge and Libertarian nominee James Blomquist.[48][49]\n\n\nLummis was considered as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination in the 2002 gubernatorial election, but declined to run.[50][51] She announced on April 30 that she would seek reelection as treasurer, and was reelected without opposition in 2002.[52][53][54] Lummis was the only statewide candidate to face no opposition in the 2002 election, as nobody had filed to run in the Democratic primary and no other candidate received the 25 write-in votes required to qualify for the nomination.[55][56] During the campaign she had raised $9,275 and spent $12,151.[57]\n\n\nShe was limited to two terms as treasurer and did not challenge the constitutionality of the legislation, despite the Wyoming Supreme Court having invalidated term limits on state legislators.[58] She endorsed former Speaker Fred Parady to succeed her as treasurer in the 2006 election, but Joseph Meyer won the Republican primary and the general election.[59][60][61]\n\n\n\n#### Tenure[edit]\n\n\nLummis conducted an accounting change by raising the interest rate on the $100 million in Wyoming banks, which reduced Wyoming's expected budget deficit in 1999 by over $5 million.[62] She also planned a 1% increase on the interest yield of Wyoming's $2.6 billion permanent fund, which would raise $26 million per year.[63] She served on the Wyoming Board of Land Commissioners alongside Governor Geringer, Secretary of State Meyer, Auditor Max Maxfield, and superintendent of public instruction Judy Catchpole.[64][65] During her tenure, the Permanent Mineral Trust Fund rose to over $2 billion for the first time.[66]\n\n\nIn April 2001, Lummis announced a conflict of interest involving her role as treasurer of the Arp and Hammond Hardware Company, which she claimed had existed since December 2000 but had existed since April 2000.[67] She and other Republican statewide officials were accused of trying to expand their powers at the expense of Governor Dave Freudenthal, but denied the claims.[68] Lummis claimed that she was the person responsible for the increase in Wyoming's investments during her tenure as treasurer, but Freudenthal said that no one person could take credit for the increase.[69]\n\n\nAs a member of the Wyoming Canvassing Board, Lummis voted unanimously alongside the three other members against a recall of the ballots cast in Natrona County during the 2002 United States House of Representatives election. Even though the results in Natrona County could not overturn the statewide results, they would determine which county was placed first on the ballot. Lummis initially supported a recount, but changed her mind after Mary Ann Collins, the Natrona County Clerk, told her that all of the ballots had been counted.[70]\n\n\nLummis and all other statewide officials in Wyoming attended the first inauguration of George W. Bush. During the 2004 presidential election, she served as one of Wyoming's 28 delegates to the Republican National Convention. Lummis was the only statewide official from Wyoming to attended Bush's second inauguration.[71][72] She served as the chair of Ray Hunkins's campaign during the 2006 gubernatorial election.[73]\n\n\n\n### United States House of Representatives[edit]\n\n\n#### Elections[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Results of the 2008 United States House of Representatives election in Wyoming   \n**Lummis**: Lummis—50–60%\n Lummis—60–70%\n Lummis—70–80%\n   \n**Trauner**: Trauner—40–50%\n Trauner—50–60%\n Trauner—60–70%\n\n![](image)Cynthia Lummis in 2009\n![](image)Cynthia Lummis with representatives Eric Cantor and Mary Fallin\nRepresentative Barbara Cubin, whom Lummis had supported during the 1994 election, announced that she would not run for reelection in the 2008 election.[74][75] On January 2, 2008, Lummis announced that she would run for Cubin's seat, winning the Republican nomination against Mark Gordon, Bill Winney, and Michael Holland, having challenged them to debates held in all 23 Wyoming counties during the primaries.[76][77][78] A poll conducted from January 18 to 21 showed that Lummis had a favorability rating of 29%, unfavorability rating of 17%, a neutral rating of 24%, and 30% did not recognize her.[79] Tucker Fagan, who later served as her chief of staff, served as Lummis's campaign manager. During the campaign Rachael Seidenschnur, her press secretary, resigned after using a fake name to ask Lummis's opponent a question.[80][81][82] She defeated Democratic nominee Gary Trauner in the general election.[83] During the campaign Lummis raised $1,557,313 and spent $1,543,875 while Trauner raised $1,672,707 and spent $1,716,013.[84][85]\n\n\nLummis was reelected in 2010 against Democratic nominee David Wendt and Libertarian nominee John V.

She was the first representative from Wyoming to serve on the Agriculture Committee since Frank O. Horton, who served on the committee from 1939 to 1941.[104][105][106][107] In 2011, she was appointed vice chair of the Appropriations Subcommittee of the Agriculture Committee.[108] Lummis left the Appropriations Committee in 2013, saying she had requested her removal from the committee and that it was not part of a purge of radical Republicans from committee positions.[109] She was appointed chair of the Science Subcommittee on Energy in 2013.[110]\n\n\nLummis served as the communications chair and spokesperson of the Congressional Western Caucus and succeeded Dean Heller as vice chair in 2011 following Heller's appointment to the United States Senate.[111][112][113] Lummis was elected to serve on the House Republican Steering Committee in 2010.[106] She was at one point the only female member of the Freedom Caucus and the last until the election of Debbie Lesko.[114][115] Lummis co-chaired the Congressional Caucus for Women's Issues alongside Representative Gwen Moore from 2011 to 2013.[116] She was also a member of the Tea Party Caucus.[117]\n\n\nLummis supported Speaker John Boehner while the Freedom Caucus successfully pushed to remove Boehner.[118] She praised the election of Paul Ryan as Speaker, saying, \"we have ushered in thoughtful, conservative leadership, restored member-driven policy-making to the legislative process and returned regular order that will bring sunshine to back rooms making government work better\".[119]\n\n\nLummis served on the Republican whip team until she was removed from the position in 2015, for voting against giving President Barack Obama the authority to propose a trade agreement with Pacific countries. She said she knew she would be removed from her position on the whip team for her vote but did not regret it. Representatives Steve Pearce and Trent Franks were also removed from the whip team for their votes.[120]\n\n\nDuring the 2008 presidential election, Lummis was supposed to give a speech at the Republican National Convention on the first day, but her speech was canceled due to Hurricane Gustav.[121] During the 2012 Republican presidential primaries she endorsed Mitt Romney and served as the chair of Romney's campaign in Wyoming.[122][123] During the 2016 Republican presidential primaries, she was a campaign surrogate for Rand Paul, and later endorsed Trump in the presidential election.[124][125]\n\n\n\n### United States Senate[edit]\n\n\n#### Elections[edit]\n\n\nAfter Senator Craig L. Thomas died on June 4, 2007, Lummis announced on June 12 that she would seek an appointment to replace him.[126] She placed third in the final vote, making her one of the nominees submitted to the governor as a candidate for appointment, alongside John Barrasso and Tom Sansonetti.[127][128] Freudenthal selected Barrasso to replace Thomas.[129] Lummis was speculated as a possible candidate in the 2014 United States Senate election.[130]\n\n\nOn June 20, 2019, Lummis filed to run for a seat in the United States Senate to succeed retiring Senator Mike Enzi.[131] She won the Republican nomination and defeated Democratic nominee Merav Ben-David in the general election.[132][133] Her victory made her the first woman to represent Wyoming in the United States Senate.[134] She raised more during the campaign than all of her Republican and Democratic opponents combined.[135] During the campaign Lummis raised $3,003,788 and spent $3,037,813 while Ben-David raised $559,626 and spent $545,348.[136][137]\n\n\n\n#### Tenure[edit]\n\n\nDuring her tenure in the Senate, Lummis has served on the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, Environment and Public Works, and Commerce, Science, and Transportation committees.[138] Hans Hunt, a member of the Wyoming state House, resigned so that he could work as Lummis's agriculture and trade policy adviser.[139]\n\n\nDuring the counting of the electoral college vote of the 2020 presidential election Lummis voted to certify the results from Arizona, but against certifying the results from Pennsylvania.[140][141] She voted to acquit Trump during his second impeachment trial.[142]\n\n\nLummis voted against the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 but for the PPP Extension Act and the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act.[143][144][145]\n\n\n\n## Political positions[edit]\n\n\n### Economy[edit]\n\n\nLummis supported the federal takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, but said the government should avoid bailing out private companies.[146] She supported the privatization of Social Security, raising the age at which people received Social Security money, and making the Bush tax cuts permanent.[147][148][149] She voted against the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.[150]\n\n\nIn 2010, the House voted 228 to 192, with Lummis in favor, to prohibit federal funding for NPR.[151] She said that House Democrats had a \"cocaine-like addiction\" to spending.[152] Lummis voted against the Hurricane Sandy relief bill, saying that although victims of Hurricane Sandy deserved the money the federal government should cut its budget to offset the cost of the legislation.[153]\n\n\nLummis has campaigned for a regulatory framework for digital assets, a stance she reiterated after the FTX exchange collapsed.[154][155]\n\n\nLummis was among the 31 Senate Republicans who voted against final passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023.[156]\n\n\n\n### Energy and climate change[edit]\n\n\nIn a 2012 campaign debate, Lummis rejected the scientific consensus on climate change, claiming that climate change was \"not settled science\".[110] She supports the development of nuclear power and oil drilling in Alaska.[157]\n\n\n\n### Equality[edit]\n\n\nIn 1979, Lummis said that it was \"important to me to see Equal Rights Amendment not rescinded\".[12] In 2015, she and Representative Carolyn Maloney led another effort to pass the ERA.[158] In 2013, the House voted 286 to 138, with Lummis against, to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act.[159] She and Senator Chris Van Hollen attempted to have a federal building in Cheyenne named after Louisa Swain, the first woman to vote in the United States.[160]\n\n\n\n### LGBT rights[edit]\n\n\nLummis voted against the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, named after Matthew Shepard, who was murdered in an anti-gay hate crime, stating that she believed that hate crime legislation was \"a state's rights issue\".[161][162] She voted against the repeal of don't ask, don't tell and co-sponsored the State Marriage Defense Act.[163] Following the Supreme Court ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges, which found same-sex marriage bans unconstitutional, Lummis supported the First Amendment Defense Act to protect religious groups that opposed gay marriage.[164] She opposes same-sex marriage and believes that it \"should be left to the states\".[165] She was given a zero percent rating from the Human Rights Campaign during her entire tenure in the House of Representatives.[166][167][168][169] She was one of 12 Republicans to vote to advance the Respect for Marriage Act, legislation that codifies same-sex marriage rights into federal law.[170] On November 29, 2022, Lummis voted for the final passage of the Respect for Marriage Act.[171][172][173] Explaining her decision, reversing her prior opposition to federal same-sex marriage recognition, she said she was \"guided by two things—the Wyoming Constitution and ensuring religious liberties for all citizens and faith-based organizations were protected.\"[174][175]\n\n\n\n### Foreign policy[edit]\n\n\nLummis supported continuing the United States' occupation of Iraq, holding that soldiers should not be withdrawn until General David Petraeus said it was time to leave. She supported the surge of soldiers in Iraq.[176] Lummis was one of four Republicans on the Agriculture Committee to vote in favor of legislation that would have lifted the travel ban on Americans and agricultural products to and from Cuba.[177] Lummis opposed American involvement in the Syrian civil war, stating that the civil war \"should be dealt with by the Arab world\" and that she did not see how \"getting involved in another open-ended and costly conflict is in the best interest of America\".[178][179]\n\n\n\n### Firearms[edit]\n\n\nLummis received an \"A\" rating and endorsement from the NRA Political Victory Fund during the 2008 campaign.[180][181] In 2009, the House voted 279 to 147, with Lummis in favor, to allow people to bring loaded guns into national parks and wildlife refuges.[182]\n\n\n\n### Health care legislation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Cynthia Lummis in 2011\nLummis supported the creation of federal legislation to allow private insurance companies to form interstate insurance pools.[183] She voted against passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2009,[184] and has supported subsequent efforts to defund the ACA.[185]\n\n\nLummis and 182 other Republican members of Congress filed an amicus brief asking the Supreme Court to halt a COVID-19 vaccination mandate for companies with 100 or more employees.[186] During the COVID-19 pandemic, she opposed adding unruly passengers to the \"no-fly\" list, saying that unruly passengers who refuse to comply with mask requirements are not the same as terrorists.[187]\n\n\nLummis co-sponsored legislation in the state house to allow state Medicaid funding to be used for abortions when the mother's life was at risk.[188] The Wyoming \"Right to Choose\" political action committee reported that Lummis was pro-choice after she completed a questionnaire during the 1990 election and the organization endorsed her during the 1992 election.[189][190] Lummis said in the 1990s that abortion was a sin, but that it should not be illegal, because people can better evaluate their circumstances than the state.[191]\n\n\nIn 2015, Lummis cosponsored and voted for legislation in the House to defund Planned Parenthood.[192] The National Right to Life Committee endorsed her in the 2020 election and gave her a 100% anti-abortion rating during her tenure in the U.S. House of Representatives. She supported the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act.[193] Lummis was given a 0% rating by NARAL Pro-Choice America in 2016.[194]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nLummis met Alvin Wiederspahn while both were campaigning during the 1978 election; they married on May 28, 1983. Both later served in the Wyoming House of Representatives, one of the few married couples to do so, though Lummis is a Republican and Wiederspahn was a Democrat.[195][196][197] She remained married to Wiederspahn, with whom she had one child, until his death on October 24, 2014.[198]\n\n\nLummis has a net worth of $12.26 million as of 2015, but reported a net worth between $20 million and $75 million from 2007 to 2008.[199][200] She purchased Bitcoin in 2013 on her son-in-law's advice and became the first U.S. senator to own cryptocurrency.[201] Her enthusiasm for the technology led to her being known as Congress's \"Crypto Queen\".[202] Lummis owned at least $230,000 worth of Bitcoin in 2021.[203] She is a Lutheran and adheres to the Lutheran Church – Missouri Synod (LCMS).[204]\n\n\n\n## Electoral history[edit]\n\n\n\n\n1986 Wyoming House of Representatives Laramie County Republican primary[19]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Republican** | **Cynthia Lummis (incumbent)**  | **6,837**  | **15.54%**  |  |\n|  | **Republican** | **Ellen Crowley**  | **6,521**  | **14.82%**  |  |\n|  | **Republican** | **Bill McIlvain**  | **6,338**  | **14.40%**  |  |\n|  | **Republican** | **April Brimmer Kunz**  | **6,173**  | **14.03%**  |  |\n|  | **Republican** | **Gary Yordy**  | **5,682**  | **12.91%**  |  |\n|  | **Republican** | **Mary Jean McDowell Baker**  | **4,480**  | **10.18%**  |  |\n|  | **Republican** | **Ronald G.

Butler began her career as a union organizer, and served as president of California SEIU State Council from 2013 to 2018. A member of the Democratic Party, she was a regent of the University of California system from 2018 to 2021, and the president of EMILY's List from 2021 to 2023. \n\n\nOn October 1, 2023, California Governor Gavin Newsom chose Butler to fill the United States Senate seat left vacant by the death of Dianne Feinstein. She is the first LGBT African American to serve in the Senate.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nButler was born on May 11, 1979, in Magnolia, Mississippi, the youngest of three children. Her father died of heart disease when Butler was 16 years old. She graduated as a salutatorian from South Pike High School in 1997.[1][2][3] Butler earned a bachelor's degree in political science from Jackson State University in 2001.[1][4]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Butler (center) with State Assemblymembers Jimmy Gomez, Bonnie Lowenthal, John Pérez, and Susan Eggman in 2013\nButler began her career as a union organizer for nurses in Baltimore and Milwaukee, janitors in Philadelphia, and hospital workers in New Haven, Connecticut. In 2009, she moved to California, where she organized in-home caregivers and nurses and served as president of SEIU United Long Term Care Workers, SEIU Local 2015.[4][5][6] Butler was elected president of the California SEIU State Council in 2013. She undertook efforts to boost California's minimum wage and raise income taxes on the wealthiest Californians.[4] As president of SEIU Local 2015, Butler endorsed Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Democratic presidential primary.[7] Butler was one of California's electors who voted for Clinton in the 2016 election.[8]\n\n\nIn 2018, California Governor Jerry Brown appointed Butler to a 12-year term as a regent of the University of California.[6] She resigned from her role as regent in 2021.[9]\n\n\nButler joined SCRB Strategies, a California-based political-consulting firm, as a partner in 2018. At SCRB, she played a central role in Kamala Harris's 2020 presidential campaign. She has been a political ally of Harris's since the latter's first run for California Attorney General in 2010, when she helped Harris negotiate a shared SEIU endorsement in the race.[4][10] Butler advised Uber in its dealings with organized labor while at SCRB,[11] at a time when Uber was attempting to stop state legislation from classifying its drivers as employees.[12] The *New York Times* reported that Butler \"advised Uber on how to deal with unions like the Teamsters and S.E.I.U., and sat in on several face-to-face meetings between the gig companies and union representatives\".[13] Butler left SCRB in 2020 to join Airbnb as director of public policy and campaigns in North America.[14][5]\n\n\nIn 2021, Butler was named the third president of EMILY's List. She was the first black woman and first mother to lead the organization.[15][4] In February 2022, Butler joined the board of directors of Vision to Learn.[16][17]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Senate[edit]\n\n\n### Appointment[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Butler sworn in by Vice President Kamala Harris in the Old Senate Chamber in 2023\nIn February 2023, incumbent U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein announced she would not run for a sixth full term in the Senate in 2024. On September 29, 2023, she died at the age of 90. At the time of Feinstein's death, several prominent candidates had already announced campaigns for her seat, including U.S. Representatives Barbara Lee, Katie Porter, and Adam Schiff. California Governor Gavin Newsom had previously pledged to nominate a black woman to the office.[18]\n\n\nOn October 1, 2023, Newsom chose Butler to fill the Senate seat left vacant by Feinstein's death, fulfilling his pledge to appoint a black woman.[19][20] Butler was selected despite not being a resident of California, as she had moved to Maryland in 2021.[21] The United States Constitution requires only that senators be \"inhabitants\" of the state they represent.[21] Newsom's office said that Butler would re-register to vote in California before taking office as a senator.[22] Shortly before nominating Butler, Newsom announced that his nominee would be free to run in 2024 if they chose,[23] a departure from his previous position.[24] On October 19, 2023, Butler announced she would not seek election to a full term in 2024.[25]\n\n\nButler became the first openly LGBT member of the U.S. Senate from California and its first black LGBT member, and was sworn in on October 3, 2023.[26][27]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | **This section is empty.** You can help by adding to it. *(October 2023)*\n |\n\n\n### Committee assignments[edit]\n\n\n* Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs[28]\n* Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs[28]\n* Committee on the Judiciary[28]\n* Committee on Rules and Administration[28]\n\n\n### Caucus memberships[edit]\n\n\n* Congressional Black Caucus[29]\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nButler is a lesbian, and she and her wife, Neneki Lee, have a daughter.[30] They moved to Silver Spring, Maryland, in 2021 when she assumed the presidency of EMILY's List,[31][32] while continuing to own a home in View Park, California, in Los Angeles County.[33] In October 2023, when Newsom appointed her to the Senate, she officially re-domiciled to that home and re-registered to vote in California.[33]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of African-American United States senators\n* List of LGBT members of the United States Congress\n* Women in the United States Senate\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Initial Page\". *Senator Butler*.

Butler began her career as a union organizer, and served as president of California SEIU State Council from 2013 to 2018. A member of the Democratic Party, she was a regent of the University of California system from 2018 to 2021, and the president of EMILY's List from 2021 to 2023. \n\n\nOn October 1, 2023, California Governor Gavin Newsom chose Butler to fill the United States Senate seat left vacant by the death of Dianne Feinstein. She is the first LGBT African American to serve in the Senate.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nButler was born on May 11, 1979, in Magnolia, Mississippi, the youngest of three children. Her father died of heart disease when Butler was 16 years old. She graduated as a salutatorian from South Pike High School in 1997.[1][2][3] Butler earned a bachelor's degree in political science from Jackson State University in 2001.[1][4]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Butler (center) with State Assemblymembers Jimmy Gomez, Bonnie Lowenthal, John Pérez, and Susan Eggman in 2013\nButler began her career as a union organizer for nurses in Baltimore and Milwaukee, janitors in Philadelphia, and hospital workers in New Haven, Connecticut. In 2009, she moved to California, where she organized in-home caregivers and nurses and served as president of SEIU United Long Term Care Workers, SEIU Local 2015.[4][5][6] Butler was elected president of the California SEIU State Council in 2013. She undertook efforts to boost California's minimum wage and raise income taxes on the wealthiest Californians.[4] As president of SEIU Local 2015, Butler endorsed Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Democratic presidential primary.[7] Butler was one of California's electors who voted for Clinton in the 2016 election.[8]\n\n\nIn 2018, California Governor Jerry Brown appointed Butler to a 12-year term as a regent of the University of California.[6] She resigned from her role as regent in 2021.[9]\n\n\nButler joined SCRB Strategies, a California-based political-consulting firm, as a partner in 2018. At SCRB, she played a central role in Kamala Harris's 2020 presidential campaign. She has been a political ally of Harris's since the latter's first run for California Attorney General in 2010, when she helped Harris negotiate a shared SEIU endorsement in the race.[4][10] Butler advised Uber in its dealings with organized labor while at SCRB,[11] at a time when Uber was attempting to stop state legislation from classifying its drivers as employees.[12] The *New York Times* reported that Butler \"advised Uber on how to deal with unions like the Teamsters and S.E.I.U., and sat in on several face-to-face meetings between the gig companies and union representatives\".[13] Butler left SCRB in 2020 to join Airbnb as director of public policy and campaigns in North America.[14][5]\n\n\nIn 2021, Butler was named the third president of EMILY's List. She was the first black woman and first mother to lead the organization.[15][4] In February 2022, Butler joined the board of directors of Vision to Learn.[16][17]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Senate[edit]\n\n\n### Appointment[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Butler sworn in by Vice President Kamala Harris in the Old Senate Chamber in 2023\nIn February 2023, incumbent U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein announced she would not run for a sixth full term in the Senate in 2024. On September 29, 2023, she died at the age of 90. At the time of Feinstein's death, several prominent candidates had already announced campaigns for her seat, including U.S. Representatives Barbara Lee, Katie Porter, and Adam Schiff. California Governor Gavin Newsom had previously pledged to nominate a black woman to the office.[18]\n\n\nOn October 1, 2023, Newsom chose Butler to fill the Senate seat left vacant by Feinstein's death, fulfilling his pledge to appoint a black woman.[19][20] Butler was selected despite not being a resident of California, as she had moved to Maryland in 2021.[21] The United States Constitution requires only that senators be \"inhabitants\" of the state they represent.[21] Newsom's office said that Butler would re-register to vote in California before taking office as a senator.[22] Shortly before nominating Butler, Newsom announced that his nominee would be free to run in 2024 if they chose,[23] a departure from his previous position.[24] On October 19, 2023, Butler announced she would not seek election to a full term in 2024.[25]\n\n\nButler became the first openly LGBT member of the U.S. Senate from California and its first black LGBT member, and was sworn in on October 3, 2023.[26][27]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | **This section is empty.** You can help by adding to it. *(October 2023)*\n |\n\n\n### Committee assignments[edit]\n\n\n* Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs[28]\n* Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs[28]\n* Committee on the Judiciary[28]\n* Committee on Rules and Administration[28]\n\n\n### Caucus memberships[edit]\n\n\n* Congressional Black Caucus[29]\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nButler is a lesbian, and she and her wife, Neneki Lee, have a daughter.[30] They moved to Silver Spring, Maryland, in 2021 when she assumed the presidency of EMILY's List,[31][32] while continuing to own a home in View Park, California, in Los Angeles County.[33] In October 2023, when Newsom appointed her to the Senate, she officially re-domiciled to that home and re-registered to vote in California.[33]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of African-American United States senators\n* List of LGBT members of the United States Congress\n* Women in the United States Senate\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Initial Page\". *Senator Butler*.
