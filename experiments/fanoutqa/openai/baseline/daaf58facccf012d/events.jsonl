You can help by adding missing items with reliable sources.\n\n![](image)\nIndian record label T-Series is the most-subscribed channel, with over 253 million subscribers as of November 2023.[update]\n![](image)\nAmerican YouTube personality MrBeast is the most-subscribed individual and second most-subscribed channel overall, with 211 million subscribers as of November 2023.[update]\n\nA subscriber to a channel on the American video-sharing platform YouTube is a user who has chosen to receive the channel's content by clicking on that channel's \"Subscribe\" button, and each user's subscription feed consists of videos published by channels to which the user is subscribed.[1] The ability to subscribe to users was introduced in October 2005.[2] YouTube began publishing a list of its most-subscribed channels in April 2006.[3] An early archive of the list dates to May 2006.[4]\n\n\nSince mid-2006, when Smosh occupied the top position with less than 3,000 subscribers,[4] at least 10 other YouTube channels have held the top spot; these include American fictional character Bree Avery, American comedian Brooke \"Brookers\" Brodack, American fictional character Fred Figglehorn, Swedish gamer Felix \"PewDiePie\" Kjellberg, American comedian Ryan Higa, American media personality Ray William Johnson, American public speaker Judson Laipply, and English geriatric Peter Oakley.\n\n\nThe most-subscribed channel is the Indian record label T-Series, which hosts its music videos on its channel. With over 253 million subscribers as of November 2023, the channel has held the top position since April 14, 2019.[5][6] The most-subscribed channel which is not 'branded' (i.e., does not belong to an organization or company) is that of American YouTuber MrBeast, who is the second most-subscribed channel overall, with over 211 million subscribers as of November 2023.[6]\n\n\n\n\n## 50 most-subscribed channels[edit]\n\n\nThe following table lists the 50 most-subscribed YouTube channels,[A][6] as well as the primary language and content category of each channel. The channels are ordered by number of subscribers. Those whose displayed subscriber counts are identical, are listed so that the channel whose current growth rate indicates that its displayed subscriber count will exceed that of the other channel is listed first. Automatically generated channels that lack their own videos, such as Music and News, and channels that have been made effectively obsolete as a result of the transferral of their content, such as JustinBieberVEVO and TaylorSwiftVEVO[B] are excluded. \n\n\nAs of November 2023, 20 of the 50 channels listed primarily produce content in English while 17 primarily produce content in Hindi. All 50 channels have surpassed 45 million subscribers, 41 of them have surpassed 50 million subscribers, 27 of them have surpassed 60 million subscribers, 19 of them have surpassed 70 million subscribers, 14 of them have surpassed 80 million subscribers, 12 of them have surpassed 90 million and 9 of them have surpassed 100 million subscribers.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Rank\n | Name\n | Link\n | Brand

During the competition, both channels gained a large number of subscribers at a rapid rate, and surpassed each other's subscriber count on multiple occasions in February, March, and April 2019.[52][53][54][56] T-Series eventually permanently surpassed PewDiePie, and on May 29, 2019 it became the first channel to reach 100 million subscribers.[72]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Internet portal\n* ![](image)Lists portal\n\n\n* List of most-viewed YouTube channels\n* List of most-viewed YouTube videos\n* List of most-liked YouTube videos\n* List of most-disliked YouTube videos\n* List of YouTubers\n* List of most-viewed Indian YouTube videos\n* List of most-viewed Pakistani YouTube videos\n* List of most-viewed Arabic music videos on YouTube\n* List of most-viewed French music videos on YouTube\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The total number of channels listed may exceed 50 if a tie exists for the 50th-highest subscriber count.\n2. **^** These are not to be mistaken for the channels Justin Bieber and Taylor Swift, both of which are included.\n3. **^** Although now called simply \"YouTube\", YouTube's official channel was named \"YouTube Spotlight\" in 2013.\n4. **^** T-Series surpassed PewDiePie in subscriber count on numerous occasions, each lasting fewer than 24 hours, from February to late March 2019.[52][53][54] The first incident to last at least 24 hours began on March 27 and ended on April 1.[55][56]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"The Quickstart Guide to YouTube – Lesson 2: YouTube Basics\". *YouTube Creator Academy*.

You can help by adding missing items with reliable sources.\n\n![](image)\nIndian record label T-Series is the most-subscribed channel, with over 253 million subscribers as of November 2023.[update]\n![](image)\nAmerican YouTube personality MrBeast is the most-subscribed individual and second most-subscribed channel overall, with 211 million subscribers as of November 2023.[update]\n\nA subscriber to a channel on the American video-sharing platform YouTube is a user who has chosen to receive the channel's content by clicking on that channel's \"Subscribe\" button, and each user's subscription feed consists of videos published by channels to which the user is subscribed.[1] The ability to subscribe to users was introduced in October 2005.[2] YouTube began publishing a list of its most-subscribed channels in April 2006.[3] An early archive of the list dates to May 2006.[4]\n\n\nSince mid-2006, when Smosh occupied the top position with less than 3,000 subscribers,[4] at least 10 other YouTube channels have held the top spot; these include American fictional character Bree Avery, American comedian Brooke \"Brookers\" Brodack, American fictional character Fred Figglehorn, Swedish gamer Felix \"PewDiePie\" Kjellberg, American comedian Ryan Higa, American media personality Ray William Johnson, American public speaker Judson Laipply, and English geriatric Peter Oakley.\n\n\nThe most-subscribed channel is the Indian record label T-Series, which hosts its music videos on its channel. With over 253 million subscribers as of November 2023, the channel has held the top position since April 14, 2019.[5][6] The most-subscribed channel which is not 'branded' (i.e., does not belong to an organization or company) is that of American YouTuber MrBeast, who is the second most-subscribed channel overall, with over 211 million subscribers as of November 2023.[6]\n\n\n\n\n## 50 most-subscribed channels[edit]\n\n\nThe following table lists the 50 most-subscribed YouTube channels,[A][6] as well as the primary language and content category of each channel. The channels are ordered by number of subscribers. Those whose displayed subscriber counts are identical, are listed so that the channel whose current growth rate indicates that its displayed subscriber count will exceed that of the other channel is listed first. Automatically generated channels that lack their own videos, such as Music and News, and channels that have been made effectively obsolete as a result of the transferral of their content, such as JustinBieberVEVO and TaylorSwiftVEVO[B] are excluded. \n\n\nAs of November 2023, 20 of the 50 channels listed primarily produce content in English while 17 primarily produce content in Hindi. All 50 channels have surpassed 45 million subscribers, 41 of them have surpassed 50 million subscribers, 27 of them have surpassed 60 million subscribers, 19 of them have surpassed 70 million subscribers, 14 of them have surpassed 80 million subscribers, 12 of them have surpassed 90 million and 9 of them have surpassed 100 million subscribers.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Rank\n | Name\n | Link\n | Brand

During the competition, both channels gained a large number of subscribers at a rapid rate, and surpassed each other's subscriber count on multiple occasions in February, March, and April 2019.[52][53][54][56] T-Series eventually permanently surpassed PewDiePie, and on May 29, 2019 it became the first channel to reach 100 million subscribers.[72]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Internet portal\n* ![](image)Lists portal\n\n\n* List of most-viewed YouTube channels\n* List of most-viewed YouTube videos\n* List of most-liked YouTube videos\n* List of most-disliked YouTube videos\n* List of YouTubers\n* List of most-viewed Indian YouTube videos\n* List of most-viewed Pakistani YouTube videos\n* List of most-viewed Arabic music videos on YouTube\n* List of most-viewed French music videos on YouTube\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The total number of channels listed may exceed 50 if a tie exists for the 50th-highest subscriber count.\n2. **^** These are not to be mistaken for the channels Justin Bieber and Taylor Swift, both of which are included.\n3. **^** Although now called simply \"YouTube\", YouTube's official channel was named \"YouTube Spotlight\" in 2013.\n4. **^** T-Series surpassed PewDiePie in subscriber count on numerous occasions, each lasting fewer than 24 hours, from February to late March 2019.[52][53][54] The first incident to last at least 24 hours began on March 27 and ended on April 1.[55][56]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"The Quickstart Guide to YouTube – Lesson 2: YouTube Basics\". *YouTube Creator Academy*.

In 2017, YouTube reported that time watching family vloggers had increased by 90%.[381][382] However, with the increase in videos featuring children, the site began to face several controversies related to child safety. During Q2 2017, the owners of popular channel FamilyOFive, which featured themselves playing \"pranks\" on their children, were accused of child abuse. Their videos were eventually deleted, and two of their children were removed from their custody.[383][384][385][386] A similar case happened in 2019 when the owner of the channel Fantastic Adventures was accused of abusing her adopted children. Her videos would later be deleted.[387]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n467. **^** \"YouTube Stories are Going Away on 6/26/2023 – YouTube Community\". *Google Help*.

In 2017, YouTube reported that time watching family vloggers had increased by 90%.[381][382] However, with the increase in videos featuring children, the site began to face several controversies related to child safety. During Q2 2017, the owners of popular channel FamilyOFive, which featured themselves playing \"pranks\" on their children, were accused of child abuse. Their videos were eventually deleted, and two of their children were removed from their custody.[383][384][385][386] A similar case happened in 2019 when the owner of the channel Fantastic Adventures was accused of abusing her adopted children. Her videos would later be deleted.[387]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n467. **^** \"YouTube Stories are Going Away on 6/26/2023 – YouTube Community\". *Google Help*.

One channel that had been of concern was \"Cocomelon\" which provided numerous mass-produced animated videos aimed at children.

In 2016, *Time* magazine named him as one of the world's 100 most influential people.[7]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nFelix Arvid Ulf Kjellberg was born on 24 October 1989 in Gothenburg, where he was also raised.[8][9] He was born to Lotta Kristine Johanna (née Hellstrand, born 1958) and Ulf Christian Kjellberg (born 1957), and grew up with his older sister, Fanny.[10] His mother, a former chief information officer (CIO), was named the 2010 CIO of the Year in Sweden.[10] His father is a corporate executive.[11]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn his first video uploaded following his 2020 hiatus, Kjellberg made jokes about the COVID-19 pandemic, and spoke in mock-Chinese phrases. After receiving criticism for these jokes, Kjellberg uploaded another video in which he made more jokes about COVID-19, and defended the jokes he made in his previous video.[157]\n\n\nKjellberg signed an exclusive deal to stream on YouTube in May, as the platform was enrolling high-profile streamers to rival competitors like Twitch and Mixer.[158] At the time of signing with YouTube, Kjellberg had amassed over 800,000 followers on DLive, but due to his deal with the former, and not having streamed on the latter in four months, *Tubefilter* noted that it was unclear if Kjellberg was still affiliated with DLive.[159] Kjellberg's DLive channel was eventually deactivated.[160]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn his early years as a YouTube creator, Kjellberg focused on video game commentaries, most notably of horror and action video games.[19][20][21] Some of his earliest videos featured commentaries of mainstream video games including *Minecraft* and *Call of Duty*, although he was particularly noted for his Let's Plays of *Amnesia: The Dark Descent* and its related mods.[22][23] On these videos, Kjellberg has stated \"I was so shy back then,\" and added, \"It was so weird to me, sitting alone in a room talking into a microphone.

In 2016, *Time* magazine named him as one of the world's 100 most influential people.[7]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nFelix Arvid Ulf Kjellberg was born on 24 October 1989 in Gothenburg, where he was also raised.[8][9] He was born to Lotta Kristine Johanna (née Hellstrand, born 1958) and Ulf Christian Kjellberg (born 1957), and grew up with his older sister, Fanny.[10] His mother, a former chief information officer (CIO), was named the 2010 CIO of the Year in Sweden.[10] His father is a corporate executive.[11]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn his first video uploaded following his 2020 hiatus, Kjellberg made jokes about the COVID-19 pandemic, and spoke in mock-Chinese phrases. After receiving criticism for these jokes, Kjellberg uploaded another video in which he made more jokes about COVID-19, and defended the jokes he made in his previous video.[157]\n\n\nKjellberg signed an exclusive deal to stream on YouTube in May, as the platform was enrolling high-profile streamers to rival competitors like Twitch and Mixer.[158] At the time of signing with YouTube, Kjellberg had amassed over 800,000 followers on DLive, but due to his deal with the former, and not having streamed on the latter in four months, *Tubefilter* noted that it was unclear if Kjellberg was still affiliated with DLive.[159] Kjellberg's DLive channel was eventually deactivated.[160]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn his early years as a YouTube creator, Kjellberg focused on video game commentaries, most notably of horror and action video games.[19][20][21] Some of his earliest videos featured commentaries of mainstream video games including *Minecraft* and *Call of Duty*, although he was particularly noted for his Let's Plays of *Amnesia: The Dark Descent* and its related mods.[22][23] On these videos, Kjellberg has stated \"I was so shy back then,\" and added, \"It was so weird to me, sitting alone in a room talking into a microphone.

He began posting videos to YouTube in early 2012, at the age of 13,[17] under the handle MrBeast6000. His early content ranged from Let's Plays to \"videos estimating the wealth of other YouTubers\".[18] He went viral in 2017 after his \"counting to 100,000\" video earned tens of thousands of views in just a few days, and he has become increasingly popular ever since, with most of his videos gaining tens of millions of views.[18] His videos, typically involving challenges and giveaways, became increasingly grand and extravagant.[19] Once his channel took off, Donaldson hired some of his childhood friends to co-run the brand. As of 2023, the MrBeast team is made up of over 250 people, including Donaldson himself.[20] Other than MrBeast, Donaldson runs the YouTube channels Beast Reacts, MrBeast Gaming, MrBeast 2 (formerly MrBeast Shorts)[21] and the philanthropy channel Beast Philanthropy.[22][23] He formerly ran MrBeast 3 (initially MrBeast 2), which is now inactive.[24][25] As of 2023, he is the highest paid YouTuber,[26] and has an estimated net worth of $500 million.[27]\n\n\nDonaldson is the founder of MrBeast Burger and Feastables; and a co-creator of Team Trees, a fundraiser for the Arbor Day Foundation that has raised over $23 million;[28][29] and Team Seas, a fundraiser for Ocean Conservancy and The Ocean Cleanup that has raised over $30 million.[30] Donaldson won the Creator of the Year award four times at the Streamy Awards in 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023; he also won the Favorite Male Creator award twice at the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards in 2022 and 2023. In 2023, *Time* named him as one of the world's 100 most influential people.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nJames Stephen Donaldson[b] was born on May 7, 1998[31] in Wichita, Kansas.[32] He was mainly raised in Greenville, North Carolina with his brother CJ.[33][34] He moved often and was under the care of au pairs due to his parents working long hours and serving in the military. His parents divorced in 2007.[33] In 2016, Donaldson graduated from Greenville Christian Academy, a small private evangelical Christian high school in the area. He briefly attended East Carolina University before dropping out.[35][36]\n\n\n\n## YouTube career[edit]\n\n\n### Early viral attempts (2012–2017)[edit]\n\n\nDonaldson uploaded his first YouTube video in February 2012, at the age of 13, under the name of \"MrBeast6000\".[37] His early content ranged from Let's Plays, mainly focused on *Minecraft* and *Call of Duty: Black Ops II*,[37] videos estimating the wealth of other YouTubers,[38] videos that offered tips to upcoming YouTube creators and commentary on YouTube drama. Donaldson appeared infrequently in these videos.[37]\n\n\nIn 2015 and 2016, Donaldson began to gain popularity with his \"Worst intros on YouTube\" series poking fun at YouTube video introductions.[37][39][40] By mid-2016, Donaldson had around 30,000 subscribers. In fall 2016, Donaldson dropped out of East Carolina University to pursue a full-time career as a YouTuber.[18][38] His mother did not approve of this and made him move out of the family home.[35]\n\n\nAs his channel grew, Donaldson hired four childhood friends – Kris Tyson (formerly Chris Tyson), Chandler Hallow, Garrett Ronalds and Jake Franklin – to contribute to his channel.[35] They then contacted numerous YouTubers in order to obtain statistics of their successful videos and predict the platform's recommendation system.[41][*clarification needed*] Franklin left the crew in 2020. Afterwards, Karl Jacobs, previously a cameraman, was promoted to take his place.[42][43][44]\n\n\n\n### Rise to fame (2017–2020)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)MrBeast in 2018\nIn January 2017, Donaldson published an almost day-long video of himself counting to 100,000, which became his breakthrough viral video.[19] The ordeal took him 40 hours, with some parts sped up to \"keep it under 24 hours.\"[45] Donaldson gained popularity during this period with stunts, such as attempting to break glass using a hundred megaphones, watching paint dry for an hour,[36] attempting to stay underwater for 24 hours, which ended up failing due to health issues, and an unsuccessful attempt to spin a fidget spinner for a day.[46] By 2018, Donaldson had given out $1 million through his outlandish stunts, which earned him the title of \"YouTube's biggest philanthropist\".[35]\n\n\nDuring the PewDiePie vs T-Series rivalry in 2018, a competition to become the most-subscribed channel on YouTube, Donaldson bought billboards and numerous television and radio advertisements to help PewDiePie gain more subscribers than T-Series.[47][48] During Super Bowl LIII, he bought multiple seats for himself and his team, whose shirts spelled out \"Sub 2 PewDiePie.\"[49][50]\n\n\nIn March 2019, Donaldson organized and filmed a real-life battle royale competition in Los Angeles with a prize of $200,000 (two games were played, making game earnings of $100,000 for each game) in collaboration with *Apex Legends*.[51] The event and prize pool was sponsored by *Apex Legends* publisher Electronic Arts.[52]\n\n\nDonaldson was accused of using counterfeit money in his video titled \"I Opened A FREE BANK\", published on November 23, 2019.[35] He later explained that he used fake money to avoid participant safety concerns and that participants received real checks after the shoot.[35]\n\n\nIn April 2020, Donaldson created a rock, paper, scissors competition stream that featured 32 influencers and a grand prize of $250,000, which at the time became YouTube's most-watched live Original event with 662,000 concurrent viewers.[53] The event was won by Nadeshot.[54] In October 2020, Donaldson hosted another influencer tournament, this time trivia, featuring 24 competitors with a grand prize of $300,000. The tournament was won by siblings Charli and Dixie D'Amelio, which caused controversy due to claims that they cheated.[55]\n\n\n\n### Mainstream success (2021–present)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jimmy Donaldson in 2021\nOn January 1, 2021, Donaldson released the video \"Youtube Rewind 2020, Thank God It's Over\".[56] In Donaldson's video, he explains that he had always believed that YouTubers \"should get more say in Rewind\", and with this in mind, he decided to call \"hundreds of YouTubers\".[56] At the end of the video, Donaldson gives a shout-out to PewDiePie, citing him and his 2018 Rewind as the inspiration for Donaldson's Rewind.[56] A month later, Donaldson signed a Facebook and Snapchat content distribution deal with Jellysmack.[57][58]\n\n\n\n![](image)MrBeast at the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards 2023\nIn November 2021, Donaldson uploaded \"$456,000 *Squid Game* in Real Life!\", a recreation of the survival drama streaming television series *Squid Game* in real life. The video had 456 people compete for a $456,000 cash prize.[59] The video was one of the most-watched YouTube videos of 2021, receiving over 130 million views within a week.[60] A review of the video in *Vice* argued that it \"badly misunderstood the anti-capitalist message of *Squid Game*\".[61] Despite this, *Squid Game* creator Hwang Dong-hyuk has reacted positively to recreations and parodies of the series.[62]\n\n\nIn December 2021, Donaldson created a third influencer tournament featuring 15 competitors with a grand prize of $1,000,000.[63][64][65] In January 2022, *Forbes* ranked Donaldson as YouTube's highest-earning creator, earning an estimated $54 million in 2021. *Forbes* stated that his income in 2021 would have placed him 40th in the 2020 Forbes Celebrity 100, earning as much money as Vin Diesel and Lewis Hamilton did in 2020.[66][67]\n\n\nOn July 28, 2022, Donaldson surpassed 100 million subscribers on his main channel, making him the fifth channel and the second individual YouTuber to achieve the milestone.[68][69] On November 17, 2022, Donaldson achieved the Guinness World Record of \"Most Subscribers for an Individual Male on YouTube\" with his MrBeast channel at 112,193,139 subscribers.[70] The previous record holder, PewDiePie, had held the record as the most subscribed YouTuber for almost ten years.[71] Donaldson achieved one billion video views over a period of 30 days on his main YouTube channel in November 2022.[72] On October 15th, 2023, Donaldson surpassed 200 million subscribers.[73]\n\n\n\n## YouTube content[edit]\n\n\nEarly in his career, Donaldson's content usually consisted of Let's Plays, \"best and worst\" videos and YouTube commentary.[74][37] Donaldson's present-day videos are categorized into three genres: stunt videos, where Donaldson or other participants perform challenges that are interesting, challenging, or dangerous; \"junklord\" videos, where Donaldson uses a large quantity of a particular product in an unusual way or spends an extravagant amount on it; and giveaway videos, where Donaldson gives away large amounts of money or extravagant prizes to people, usually including a competitive aspect.[c] Giveaway videos are considered to be a distinctive feature of Donaldson's content.[74]\n\n\nDonaldson's videos leverage YouTube's recommendation algorithm in order to go viral, mainly by maximizing click-through rate and viewer retention.[74] To maximize click-through rate, he focuses on creating effective topics, titles and thumbnails.[75] In an interview with Lex Fridman, he stated that for him to create a viral video, it needed to be \"original, creative, something people really need to see, ideally never been done before\".[76] His titles are designed to attract attention by promising outrageous stunts, and using certain keywords like \"24-hours\" and \"challenge\".[41][75] His thumbnails are designed to be easily understandable, clearly focused and brightly colored.[77] To maximize viewer retention, Donaldson paces the videos to have viewers engaged throughout. His videos typically span 10-20 minutes. He hooks viewers by explaining the premise in under half a minute at the start of the video,[41] and promises a \"finale\" to have viewers engaged until the end of the video.[74]\n\n\nDonaldson's funding for these videos mainly come from sponsorships and Google's AdSense program.[78] Donaldson was reported in 2022 to spend about $1 million on each video.[79] Although Donaldson's videos rarely turn a profit, he is concentrated more on expanding his YouTube channel rather than earning a profit, stating in an interview with *Rolling Stone*: \"I could be doing cheaper videos, [...] But I just don't want to. I want to push the boundaries to go bigger, bigger\".[79][80] Most of his funding come from sponsorships.[78] Donaldson uses his reaction channel and gaming channel to help finance his main channel, as their videos are relatively cheap to produce and make a substantial amount of money.[79] *The Verge* noted that his revenue is self-perpetuating: \"The more viral he becomes, the more brands want to work with him, and the bigger his own AdSense earnings get. He can then entice viewers with even bigger giveaway videos. It's a never ending cycle.\"[78] Donaldson earns passive income through merchandise, MrBeast Burger, and Feastables.[74][81]\n\n\nAs of 2023, Donaldson employs over 250 people.[82] They include writers, editors and production assistants. Many employees were people familiar to Donaldson, such as friends and family members.[83] Some former employees alleged that Donaldson nurtured a difficult work environment. In a May 2021 *New York Times* article, Matt Turner, an editor for Donaldson from February 2018 to September 2019, claimed that Donaldson berated him almost daily, including calling him a \"retard\". Turner reported that he was regularly not credited for his work.[83] Reporting by *Insider* showed that Turner previously posted a video in 2018 explaining his allegations, and in October 2019 released a deleted Twitter thread which stated that he was \"yelled at, bullied, called mentally retarded and replaceable by Donaldson every single day.\"[84] Nate Anderson, another editor, quit after working for Donaldson for a week in 2018 over what he said were unreasonable demands, and called Donaldson a perfectionist. After releasing a video describing his experience, Anderson reportedly received death threats from Donaldson's fans. Nine other employees who worked for Donaldson also stated that while he was sometimes generous, his demeanor would change when the cameras were off.[83][84] Donaldson disputes these claims, stating: \"We have high standards, but it’s not a toxic work environment.\"[79] Donaldson also claims that he gave Turner $10,000 and suggested a job at another company to him at the end of his contract.\n\n\n\n## Other ventures[edit]\n\n\n### Finger on the App[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2020, Donaldson, in collaboration with Brooklyn-based art collective MSCHF, released a one-time multiplayer mobile game titled *Finger on the App*. In the game, players touch their phone screen and the last person to remove their finger from the screen wins $25,000.[85] In the end, four people ended up winning $20,000 each after keeping their finger on the app for over 70 hours.[86] The game was reportedly so successful that a sequel titled *Finger on the App 2* was planned to originally launch in December 2020. The game was postponed to February, and then further delayed to March 2021 due to a flood of downloads, causing the game to crash and requiring the game's developers to upgrade their servers. This time, the game featured a grand prize of $100,000.[87] The winner kept their finger on the phone screen for around 51 hours. The second-place finisher also received a prize of $20,000.[88]\n\n\n\n### MrBeast Burger[edit]\n\n\nMain article: MrBeast Burger\n\n![](image)A MrBeast Burger restaurant in New Jersey\nWill Hyde, a producer for the MrBeast channel, announced in a November 2020 article with *The Wake Weekly* that Donaldson would launch a virtual restaurant called MrBeast Burger in December 2020. Hyde said his team worked with Virtual Dining Concepts during the development of the restaurant concept. He said that MrBeast Burger will sell franchise rights to serve the burgers to restaurants across the U.S. and customers will be able to order the burgers via online delivery services.[89]\n\n\nIn August 2022, Donaldson announced that he would bring a MrBeast Burger shop to the American Dream Mall in East Rutherford, New Jersey, near New York City, to be the location of his first U.S. restaurant. The restaurant opened on September 4, 2022.[90]\n\n\nOn June 17, 2023, Donaldson expressed wishes to shut down MrBeast Burger due to fears that quality cannot be guaranteed, saying he regrets signing \"a bad deal\" with Virtual Dining Concepts, LLC, but said the company \"won't let me stop even though it's terrible for my brand.\"[91][92][93] On July 31, 2023, Donaldson sued Virtual Dining Concepts to end their partnership, alleging that the company damaged his reputation by prioritizing the expansion of the MrBeast Burger brand over food quality. Donaldson also claimed he received no payment from the partnership.[94][95] Virtual Dining Concepts disputed the claims, stating Donaldson had grown his reputation due to the MrBeast Burger brand, and accused Donaldson of attempting a new deal for personal gain and resorting to \"bullying\" when rejected.[96]\n\n\n\n### Feastables[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Feastables\n\n![](image)Feastables Bar\nIn January 2022, Donaldson announced the creation of a new food company called Feastables, which launched with its own brand of chocolate bars called \"MrBeast Bars\". At launch they offered three flavors of bars: original, almond and quinoa crunch. The launch corresponded with a sweepstakes with over $1 million in prizes, including ten grand prize winners who would receive a chance to compete for a chocolate factory in a future video, emulating *Charlie and the Chocolate Factory*.[97] The video, released in June 2022, contained a series of elimination challenges where the winner won the choice of the chocolate factory or a $500,000 cash prize. Michelin Star chef Gordon Ramsay featured as a judge in the final challenge of the video and ultimately decided who won the cash prize.[98][99] Feastables reportedly made $10 million in its first few months of operation.[100]\n\n\nOn March 3, 2023, Donaldson asked fans on Twitter to \"clean up the presentation\" of Feastables displays on store shelves, and suggested that they obscure competing products. Feastables offered fans entry into a $5,000 raffle if they provided proof of their assistance. The tweets drew criticism and accusations that Feastables was exploiting fans for unpaid labor.[101][102]\n\n\nOn October 2, 2023, Feastables signed a partnership with the Charlotte Hornets to include MrBeast's insignia on their jerseys.[103][104]\n\n\n\n### Investments and partnerships[edit]\n\n\nDonaldson is an investor in the tech startup Backbone, which produces the Backbone One, a controller that makes smartphones appear more similar to Nintendo Switch controllers, and the Backbone app, a content creation and social tools app for its users.[105][106]\n\n\nIn March 2021, Donaldson partnered with Creative Juice financial network to introduce Juice Funds, a $2 million investment fund for content creators.[107][83]\n\n\nIn April 2021, Donaldson became a long-term investor and partner of financial technology company Current.[108][109] The same month, Donaldson received backlash after fans lost large amounts of money in a cryptocurrency scheme that Donaldson had invested in and promoted.[83]\n\n\nIn November 2022, Donaldson partnered with East Carolina University to create a course centered around YouTube content creation.[110][111]\n\n\nIn May 2023, Donaldson featured as a judge on Gordon Ramsay's *Food Stars* show.[112]\n\n\n\n## Philanthropy[edit]\n\n\n### Team Trees[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Team Trees\n\n![](image)Team Trees\nOn October 25, 2019, Donaldson and former NASA engineer and YouTuber Mark Rober announced a collaborative fundraising challenge event on YouTube called #TeamTrees. The goal of this project was to raise $20 million for the Arbor Day Foundation by January 1, 2020, and plant trees \"no later than December 2022.\" Every donation goes to the Arbor Day Foundation, which pledges to plant one tree for every dollar donated. Notable YouTubers such as Rhett & Link, Marshmello, iJustine, Marques Brownlee, The Slow Mo Guys, Ninja, Simone Giertz, Jacksepticeye and Smarter Every Day brought attention to the project, and trees began to be planted in October 2019 in US national parks.[113][114]\n\n\nOn December 19 of that year, the $20,000,000 goal was surpassed.[115] The project has received large donations from corporate executives Jack Dorsey, Susan Wojcicki, Elon Musk[116] and Tobias Lütke,[117] as well as from companies such as Discovery, Verizon and Plants vs. Zombies.[118] Tobias Lütke, founder and CEO of Shopify, holds the record for the highest donation at 1,000,001 trees planted.[119] As of February 11, 2023, the original goal of 20 million trees has been far surpassed, with over 24.3 million trees in the ground.[120]\n\n\n\n### Beast Philanthropy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Greenville received Thanksgiving meals as part of an initiative by Beast Philanthropy and Jennie-O.[121][122]\nOn September 17, 2020, the YouTube channel Beast Philanthropy was created.[123] On the channel's first video, Donaldson announced the charity and food bank and named Darren Margolias, who had appeared in previous videos, as executive director.[24][124] According to the channel description, 100% of its advertising revenue, brand deals and merchandise sales are donated to charity.[19][123]\n\n\nNotable initiatives by Beast Philanthropy include giving away 10,000 turkeys to his hometown Greenville,[121][122] donating 20,000 shoes to children in Africa,[125] and gifting $300,000 worth of technology to various schools.[126]\n\n\n\n### Team Seas[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Team Seas\n\n![](image)Team Seas\nOn October 29, 2021, Donaldson and Rober organized another collaborative challenge event on YouTube titled #TeamSeas. The goal of this project was to raise $30 million for the Ocean Conservancy and The Ocean Cleanup by January 1, 2022. The $30 million goal would fund the removal of 30 million pounds of plastic and other waste from oceans, rivers, and beaches. Donaldson and Rober enlisted thousands of content creators, including AzzyLand, DanTDM, TommyInnit, LinusTechTips, TierZoo, LEMMiNO, The Infographics Show, Hannah Stocking, Dhar Mann and Marques Brownlee, and partnered with BEN and TubeBuddy's initiative of eight million global creators, to promote the fundraiser.[127][128][129]\n\n\n\n### Cataract surgery[edit]\n\n\nIn a video published in January 2023 titled \"1,000 Blind People See For The First Time\", Donaldson paid for cataract surgery for a thousand people who had severely limited vision and had been unable to afford the procedure.[130] Responses to his video on the subject ranged from praise at its intention to spread awareness to criticism that he was creating \"charity porn\" motivated solely by profit.[131] Other comments criticized the American medical system for failing to provide the necessary healthcare to the patients in the video, questioning why patients had to rely on a YouTuber for the procedure.[132]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nDonaldson describes himself as an introvert. Donaldson admits to having difficulty maintaining a social life due to his obsession with YouTube and his intense work ethic. Donaldson's mother, Sue, attributes his withdrawn lifestyle to their frequent relocations and his struggles with Crohn's disease.[133]\n\n\nDonaldson dated Maddy Spidell, a YouTuber, from 2019 to 2022. He has dated Thea Booysen, a gaming streamer, since 2022.[134][135]\n\n\nIn June 2023, Donaldson stated that he was invited to go on a tourist expedition to view the wreck of the *Titanic* in the OceanGate submersible *Titan* but declined the offer.[136] The submersible imploded in the Atlantic Ocean, killing all five aboard.[137]\n\n\n\n### Personal views[edit]\n\n\nIn an April 2022 interview with *The Daily Beast*, Donaldson announced that he was no longer an evangelical Christian and identified himself as an agnostic. He also stated that he had long disagreed with the church's position on homosexuality. He states that during the time he grew up in \"the heart of the Bible Belt\", he had religion \"beat into [his] head every day\", and was taught that \"gay people are the reason God's going to come and burn this Earth\". Although he considered anti-LGBT rhetoric to be normal growing up, he has disavowed it since then, stating: \"I realized, 'Oh, this isn't normal. This is just a weird place I grew up in.' So, that type of thing, I [wish I could] go back in time and be like, 'Hey, stop'.\"[133][138]\n\n\nDonaldson considers himself strictly apolitical, saying that \"I don't want to alienate Republicans and Democrats. ... I like having it where everyone can support charity. My goal is to feed hundreds of millions of people ... it would be very silly of me to alienate basically half of America.\"[133] On a podcast in September 2022, Donaldson has commented he would consider a run for president of the United States \"in like 20 years\", adding that the U.S. is \"due for younger presidents\".[139][140]\n\n\n\n## Public image[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | This section **needs expansion** with: a more detailed description of his popularity and public image. You can help by adding to it. *(October 2023)*\n |\n\n\n![](image)MrBeast's large model gumball machine at Vidcon 2022\nOpinion polls have shown that Donaldson is one of the most well-liked YouTubers on the platform. A 2021 SurveyMonkey poll showed that 70% of respondents have a favorable view of him, compared to 12% who had an unfavorable view.[141] In 2023, *Time* listed him on their *Time 100* list; fellow YouTuber and former NASA engineer Mark Rober wrote on his entry: \"He's constantly raising the bar for creators whether it's through re-creating *Squid Game* in real life or paying for the eye surgeries of 1,000 blind people. He doesn't really understand small thinking or complacency. I don't know what he'll do 10 years down the road, but I know it won't be status quo.\"[142] In 2023, CBC News noted that MrBeast's \"viral videos have stoked a wide range of reaction, from acclaim for their altruism to controversy for perceived exploitation.\"[143]\n\n\nIn October 2018, *The Atlantic* published an article on Donaldson's history of using homophobic slurs.[61][144][145] The article stated that Donaldson, while still a teenager, had had a habit of referring to people as \"fags\" on Twitter and regularly treated being homosexual as a punchline in jokes and \"gay\" as an insult.[144] Donaldson later removed the tweets, and in 2021, a spokesperson for Donaldson said that the YouTuber had \"grown up and matured into someone that doesn't speak like that\".[146]\n\n\nIn 2023, Donaldson's childhood friend and employee, Kris (formerly Chris) Tyson, came out as transgender. When a critic tweeted that her transition would be a “nightmare” for the influencer, Donaldson replied, “Yeah, this is getting absurd. Chris isn’t my ‘nightmare’ he’s my friend and things are fine. All this transphobia is starting to piss me off.”[147][148][149]\n\n\nDuring a Clubhouse room in February 2021, Donaldson booted entrepreneur Farokh Sarmad after he allegedly said he could not pronounce his name, a move that Sarmad later said was racist. Sarmad's claims were questioned and denied by other Clubhouse users, who were present at the call who argued against Sarmad's claims, claiming that Donaldson removed him along with others to make room for women to be more inclusive.[150][151]\n\n\n\n## Filmography[edit]\n\n\n\n\nFilm\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2023\n | *Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem* | Times Square Bystander\n |  | [152] |\n| *Under the Boardwalk* | Hot Sauce Crab\n |  |  |\n\n\n## Awards and nominations[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Ceremony\n | Category\n | Result\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2019\n | 9th Streamy Awards | Breakout Creator\n | Won\n | [153] |\n| Ensemble Cast\n | Nominated\n |\n| Creator of the Year\n | Nominated\n |\n| 2020\n | 12th Annual Shorty Awards | YouTuber of the Year\n | Won\n |  |\n| 10th Streamy Awards | Creator of the Year\n | Won\n | [154][155] |\n| Live Special\n | Won\n |\n| Social Good: Creator\n | Won\n |\n| Social Good: Nonprofit or NGO\n | Won\n |\n| 2021\n | 2021 Kids' Choice Awards | Favorite Male Social Star\n | Nominated\n | [156] |\n| 11th Streamy Awards | Creator of the Year\n | Won\n | [157] |\n| 2022\n | 2022 Kids' Choice Awards | Favorite Male Creator\n | Won\n | [158] |\n| 12th Streamy Awards | Creator of the Year\n | Won\n | [159][160] |\n| Collaboration\n | Nominated\n |\n| Social Good: Creator[d] | Won\n |\n| Creator Product\n | Nominated\n |\n| Editing\n | Nominated\n |\n| Brand Engagement[d] | Won\n |\n| Social Impact Campaign[d] | Nominated\n |\n| 2023\n | 2023 Kids' Choice Awards | Favorite Male Creator\n | Won\n | [161] |\n| 13th Streamy Awards | Creator of the Year\n | Won\n | [162] |\n| Collaboration\n | Won\n |\n| Creator Product\n | Nominated\n |\n| Brand Engagement\n | Nominated\n |\n\n\n### World records[edit]\n\n\n\n\nName of publication, year the record was awarded, name of the record, and the name of the record holder\n| Publication\n | Year\n | World record\n | Record holder\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| *Guinness World Records* | 2021\n | Highest-earning YouTube contributor (current)\n | MrBeast\n | [163] |\n| 2022\n | Largest vegetarian burger\n | [164] |\n| Most subscribers for an individual male on YouTube\n | Jimmy Donaldson\n | [165] |\n| 2023\n | First person to reach 1 million followers on Threads | MrBeast\n | [166] |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of YouTubers\n* List of most-subscribed YouTube channels\n* Night Media\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Only the six main channels are included: MrBeast, MrBeast Gaming, Beast Reacts, MrBeast 2 (formerly MrBeast Shorts), Beast Philanthropy and MrBeast 3 (formerly MrBeast 2).\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Sources conflict on the spelling of Donaldson's middle name.

He began posting videos to YouTube in early 2012, at the age of 13,[17] under the handle MrBeast6000. His early content ranged from Let's Plays to \"videos estimating the wealth of other YouTubers\".[18] He went viral in 2017 after his \"counting to 100,000\" video earned tens of thousands of views in just a few days, and he has become increasingly popular ever since, with most of his videos gaining tens of millions of views.[18] His videos, typically involving challenges and giveaways, became increasingly grand and extravagant.[19] Once his channel took off, Donaldson hired some of his childhood friends to co-run the brand. As of 2023, the MrBeast team is made up of over 250 people, including Donaldson himself.[20] Other than MrBeast, Donaldson runs the YouTube channels Beast Reacts, MrBeast Gaming, MrBeast 2 (formerly MrBeast Shorts)[21] and the philanthropy channel Beast Philanthropy.[22][23] He formerly ran MrBeast 3 (initially MrBeast 2), which is now inactive.[24][25] As of 2023, he is the highest paid YouTuber,[26] and has an estimated net worth of $500 million.[27]\n\n\nDonaldson is the founder of MrBeast Burger and Feastables; and a co-creator of Team Trees, a fundraiser for the Arbor Day Foundation that has raised over $23 million;[28][29] and Team Seas, a fundraiser for Ocean Conservancy and The Ocean Cleanup that has raised over $30 million.[30] Donaldson won the Creator of the Year award four times at the Streamy Awards in 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023; he also won the Favorite Male Creator award twice at the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards in 2022 and 2023. In 2023, *Time* named him as one of the world's 100 most influential people.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nJames Stephen Donaldson[b] was born on May 7, 1998[31] in Wichita, Kansas.[32] He was mainly raised in Greenville, North Carolina with his brother CJ.[33][34] He moved often and was under the care of au pairs due to his parents working long hours and serving in the military. His parents divorced in 2007.[33] In 2016, Donaldson graduated from Greenville Christian Academy, a small private evangelical Christian high school in the area. He briefly attended East Carolina University before dropping out.[35][36]\n\n\n\n## YouTube career[edit]\n\n\n### Early viral attempts (2012–2017)[edit]\n\n\nDonaldson uploaded his first YouTube video in February 2012, at the age of 13, under the name of \"MrBeast6000\".[37] His early content ranged from Let's Plays, mainly focused on *Minecraft* and *Call of Duty: Black Ops II*,[37] videos estimating the wealth of other YouTubers,[38] videos that offered tips to upcoming YouTube creators and commentary on YouTube drama. Donaldson appeared infrequently in these videos.[37]\n\n\nIn 2015 and 2016, Donaldson began to gain popularity with his \"Worst intros on YouTube\" series poking fun at YouTube video introductions.[37][39][40] By mid-2016, Donaldson had around 30,000 subscribers. In fall 2016, Donaldson dropped out of East Carolina University to pursue a full-time career as a YouTuber.[18][38] His mother did not approve of this and made him move out of the family home.[35]\n\n\nAs his channel grew, Donaldson hired four childhood friends – Kris Tyson (formerly Chris Tyson), Chandler Hallow, Garrett Ronalds and Jake Franklin – to contribute to his channel.[35] They then contacted numerous YouTubers in order to obtain statistics of their successful videos and predict the platform's recommendation system.[41][*clarification needed*] Franklin left the crew in 2020. Afterwards, Karl Jacobs, previously a cameraman, was promoted to take his place.[42][43][44]\n\n\n\n### Rise to fame (2017–2020)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)MrBeast in 2018\nIn January 2017, Donaldson published an almost day-long video of himself counting to 100,000, which became his breakthrough viral video.[19] The ordeal took him 40 hours, with some parts sped up to \"keep it under 24 hours.\"[45] Donaldson gained popularity during this period with stunts, such as attempting to break glass using a hundred megaphones, watching paint dry for an hour,[36] attempting to stay underwater for 24 hours, which ended up failing due to health issues, and an unsuccessful attempt to spin a fidget spinner for a day.[46] By 2018, Donaldson had given out $1 million through his outlandish stunts, which earned him the title of \"YouTube's biggest philanthropist\".[35]\n\n\nDuring the PewDiePie vs T-Series rivalry in 2018, a competition to become the most-subscribed channel on YouTube, Donaldson bought billboards and numerous television and radio advertisements to help PewDiePie gain more subscribers than T-Series.[47][48] During Super Bowl LIII, he bought multiple seats for himself and his team, whose shirts spelled out \"Sub 2 PewDiePie.\"[49][50]\n\n\nIn March 2019, Donaldson organized and filmed a real-life battle royale competition in Los Angeles with a prize of $200,000 (two games were played, making game earnings of $100,000 for each game) in collaboration with *Apex Legends*.[51] The event and prize pool was sponsored by *Apex Legends* publisher Electronic Arts.[52]\n\n\nDonaldson was accused of using counterfeit money in his video titled \"I Opened A FREE BANK\", published on November 23, 2019.[35] He later explained that he used fake money to avoid participant safety concerns and that participants received real checks after the shoot.[35]\n\n\nIn April 2020, Donaldson created a rock, paper, scissors competition stream that featured 32 influencers and a grand prize of $250,000, which at the time became YouTube's most-watched live Original event with 662,000 concurrent viewers.[53] The event was won by Nadeshot.[54] In October 2020, Donaldson hosted another influencer tournament, this time trivia, featuring 24 competitors with a grand prize of $300,000. The tournament was won by siblings Charli and Dixie D'Amelio, which caused controversy due to claims that they cheated.[55]\n\n\n\n### Mainstream success (2021–present)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jimmy Donaldson in 2021\nOn January 1, 2021, Donaldson released the video \"Youtube Rewind 2020, Thank God It's Over\".[56] In Donaldson's video, he explains that he had always believed that YouTubers \"should get more say in Rewind\", and with this in mind, he decided to call \"hundreds of YouTubers\".[56] At the end of the video, Donaldson gives a shout-out to PewDiePie, citing him and his 2018 Rewind as the inspiration for Donaldson's Rewind.[56] A month later, Donaldson signed a Facebook and Snapchat content distribution deal with Jellysmack.[57][58]\n\n\n\n![](image)MrBeast at the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards 2023\nIn November 2021, Donaldson uploaded \"$456,000 *Squid Game* in Real Life!\", a recreation of the survival drama streaming television series *Squid Game* in real life. The video had 456 people compete for a $456,000 cash prize.[59] The video was one of the most-watched YouTube videos of 2021, receiving over 130 million views within a week.[60] A review of the video in *Vice* argued that it \"badly misunderstood the anti-capitalist message of *Squid Game*\".[61] Despite this, *Squid Game* creator Hwang Dong-hyuk has reacted positively to recreations and parodies of the series.[62]\n\n\nIn December 2021, Donaldson created a third influencer tournament featuring 15 competitors with a grand prize of $1,000,000.[63][64][65] In January 2022, *Forbes* ranked Donaldson as YouTube's highest-earning creator, earning an estimated $54 million in 2021. *Forbes* stated that his income in 2021 would have placed him 40th in the 2020 Forbes Celebrity 100, earning as much money as Vin Diesel and Lewis Hamilton did in 2020.[66][67]\n\n\nOn July 28, 2022, Donaldson surpassed 100 million subscribers on his main channel, making him the fifth channel and the second individual YouTuber to achieve the milestone.[68][69] On November 17, 2022, Donaldson achieved the Guinness World Record of \"Most Subscribers for an Individual Male on YouTube\" with his MrBeast channel at 112,193,139 subscribers.[70] The previous record holder, PewDiePie, had held the record as the most subscribed YouTuber for almost ten years.[71] Donaldson achieved one billion video views over a period of 30 days on his main YouTube channel in November 2022.[72] On October 15th, 2023, Donaldson surpassed 200 million subscribers.[73]\n\n\n\n## YouTube content[edit]\n\n\nEarly in his career, Donaldson's content usually consisted of Let's Plays, \"best and worst\" videos and YouTube commentary.[74][37] Donaldson's present-day videos are categorized into three genres: stunt videos, where Donaldson or other participants perform challenges that are interesting, challenging, or dangerous; \"junklord\" videos, where Donaldson uses a large quantity of a particular product in an unusual way or spends an extravagant amount on it; and giveaway videos, where Donaldson gives away large amounts of money or extravagant prizes to people, usually including a competitive aspect.[c] Giveaway videos are considered to be a distinctive feature of Donaldson's content.[74]\n\n\nDonaldson's videos leverage YouTube's recommendation algorithm in order to go viral, mainly by maximizing click-through rate and viewer retention.[74] To maximize click-through rate, he focuses on creating effective topics, titles and thumbnails.[75] In an interview with Lex Fridman, he stated that for him to create a viral video, it needed to be \"original, creative, something people really need to see, ideally never been done before\".[76] His titles are designed to attract attention by promising outrageous stunts, and using certain keywords like \"24-hours\" and \"challenge\".[41][75] His thumbnails are designed to be easily understandable, clearly focused and brightly colored.[77] To maximize viewer retention, Donaldson paces the videos to have viewers engaged throughout. His videos typically span 10-20 minutes. He hooks viewers by explaining the premise in under half a minute at the start of the video,[41] and promises a \"finale\" to have viewers engaged until the end of the video.[74]\n\n\nDonaldson's funding for these videos mainly come from sponsorships and Google's AdSense program.[78] Donaldson was reported in 2022 to spend about $1 million on each video.[79] Although Donaldson's videos rarely turn a profit, he is concentrated more on expanding his YouTube channel rather than earning a profit, stating in an interview with *Rolling Stone*: \"I could be doing cheaper videos, [...] But I just don't want to. I want to push the boundaries to go bigger, bigger\".[79][80] Most of his funding come from sponsorships.[78] Donaldson uses his reaction channel and gaming channel to help finance his main channel, as their videos are relatively cheap to produce and make a substantial amount of money.[79] *The Verge* noted that his revenue is self-perpetuating: \"The more viral he becomes, the more brands want to work with him, and the bigger his own AdSense earnings get. He can then entice viewers with even bigger giveaway videos. It's a never ending cycle.\"[78] Donaldson earns passive income through merchandise, MrBeast Burger, and Feastables.[74][81]\n\n\nAs of 2023, Donaldson employs over 250 people.[82] They include writers, editors and production assistants. Many employees were people familiar to Donaldson, such as friends and family members.[83] Some former employees alleged that Donaldson nurtured a difficult work environment. In a May 2021 *New York Times* article, Matt Turner, an editor for Donaldson from February 2018 to September 2019, claimed that Donaldson berated him almost daily, including calling him a \"retard\". Turner reported that he was regularly not credited for his work.[83] Reporting by *Insider* showed that Turner previously posted a video in 2018 explaining his allegations, and in October 2019 released a deleted Twitter thread which stated that he was \"yelled at, bullied, called mentally retarded and replaceable by Donaldson every single day.\"[84] Nate Anderson, another editor, quit after working for Donaldson for a week in 2018 over what he said were unreasonable demands, and called Donaldson a perfectionist. After releasing a video describing his experience, Anderson reportedly received death threats from Donaldson's fans. Nine other employees who worked for Donaldson also stated that while he was sometimes generous, his demeanor would change when the cameras were off.[83][84] Donaldson disputes these claims, stating: \"We have high standards, but it’s not a toxic work environment.\"[79] Donaldson also claims that he gave Turner $10,000 and suggested a job at another company to him at the end of his contract.\n\n\n\n## Other ventures[edit]\n\n\n### Finger on the App[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2020, Donaldson, in collaboration with Brooklyn-based art collective MSCHF, released a one-time multiplayer mobile game titled *Finger on the App*. In the game, players touch their phone screen and the last person to remove their finger from the screen wins $25,000.[85] In the end, four people ended up winning $20,000 each after keeping their finger on the app for over 70 hours.[86] The game was reportedly so successful that a sequel titled *Finger on the App 2* was planned to originally launch in December 2020. The game was postponed to February, and then further delayed to March 2021 due to a flood of downloads, causing the game to crash and requiring the game's developers to upgrade their servers. This time, the game featured a grand prize of $100,000.[87] The winner kept their finger on the phone screen for around 51 hours. The second-place finisher also received a prize of $20,000.[88]\n\n\n\n### MrBeast Burger[edit]\n\n\nMain article: MrBeast Burger\n\n![](image)A MrBeast Burger restaurant in New Jersey\nWill Hyde, a producer for the MrBeast channel, announced in a November 2020 article with *The Wake Weekly* that Donaldson would launch a virtual restaurant called MrBeast Burger in December 2020. Hyde said his team worked with Virtual Dining Concepts during the development of the restaurant concept. He said that MrBeast Burger will sell franchise rights to serve the burgers to restaurants across the U.S. and customers will be able to order the burgers via online delivery services.[89]\n\n\nIn August 2022, Donaldson announced that he would bring a MrBeast Burger shop to the American Dream Mall in East Rutherford, New Jersey, near New York City, to be the location of his first U.S. restaurant. The restaurant opened on September 4, 2022.[90]\n\n\nOn June 17, 2023, Donaldson expressed wishes to shut down MrBeast Burger due to fears that quality cannot be guaranteed, saying he regrets signing \"a bad deal\" with Virtual Dining Concepts, LLC, but said the company \"won't let me stop even though it's terrible for my brand.\"[91][92][93] On July 31, 2023, Donaldson sued Virtual Dining Concepts to end their partnership, alleging that the company damaged his reputation by prioritizing the expansion of the MrBeast Burger brand over food quality. Donaldson also claimed he received no payment from the partnership.[94][95] Virtual Dining Concepts disputed the claims, stating Donaldson had grown his reputation due to the MrBeast Burger brand, and accused Donaldson of attempting a new deal for personal gain and resorting to \"bullying\" when rejected.[96]\n\n\n\n### Feastables[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Feastables\n\n![](image)Feastables Bar\nIn January 2022, Donaldson announced the creation of a new food company called Feastables, which launched with its own brand of chocolate bars called \"MrBeast Bars\". At launch they offered three flavors of bars: original, almond and quinoa crunch. The launch corresponded with a sweepstakes with over $1 million in prizes, including ten grand prize winners who would receive a chance to compete for a chocolate factory in a future video, emulating *Charlie and the Chocolate Factory*.[97] The video, released in June 2022, contained a series of elimination challenges where the winner won the choice of the chocolate factory or a $500,000 cash prize. Michelin Star chef Gordon Ramsay featured as a judge in the final challenge of the video and ultimately decided who won the cash prize.[98][99] Feastables reportedly made $10 million in its first few months of operation.[100]\n\n\nOn March 3, 2023, Donaldson asked fans on Twitter to \"clean up the presentation\" of Feastables displays on store shelves, and suggested that they obscure competing products. Feastables offered fans entry into a $5,000 raffle if they provided proof of their assistance. The tweets drew criticism and accusations that Feastables was exploiting fans for unpaid labor.[101][102]\n\n\nOn October 2, 2023, Feastables signed a partnership with the Charlotte Hornets to include MrBeast's insignia on their jerseys.[103][104]\n\n\n\n### Investments and partnerships[edit]\n\n\nDonaldson is an investor in the tech startup Backbone, which produces the Backbone One, a controller that makes smartphones appear more similar to Nintendo Switch controllers, and the Backbone app, a content creation and social tools app for its users.[105][106]\n\n\nIn March 2021, Donaldson partnered with Creative Juice financial network to introduce Juice Funds, a $2 million investment fund for content creators.[107][83]\n\n\nIn April 2021, Donaldson became a long-term investor and partner of financial technology company Current.[108][109] The same month, Donaldson received backlash after fans lost large amounts of money in a cryptocurrency scheme that Donaldson had invested in and promoted.[83]\n\n\nIn November 2022, Donaldson partnered with East Carolina University to create a course centered around YouTube content creation.[110][111]\n\n\nIn May 2023, Donaldson featured as a judge on Gordon Ramsay's *Food Stars* show.[112]\n\n\n\n## Philanthropy[edit]\n\n\n### Team Trees[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Team Trees\n\n![](image)Team Trees\nOn October 25, 2019, Donaldson and former NASA engineer and YouTuber Mark Rober announced a collaborative fundraising challenge event on YouTube called #TeamTrees. The goal of this project was to raise $20 million for the Arbor Day Foundation by January 1, 2020, and plant trees \"no later than December 2022.\" Every donation goes to the Arbor Day Foundation, which pledges to plant one tree for every dollar donated. Notable YouTubers such as Rhett & Link, Marshmello, iJustine, Marques Brownlee, The Slow Mo Guys, Ninja, Simone Giertz, Jacksepticeye and Smarter Every Day brought attention to the project, and trees began to be planted in October 2019 in US national parks.[113][114]\n\n\nOn December 19 of that year, the $20,000,000 goal was surpassed.[115] The project has received large donations from corporate executives Jack Dorsey, Susan Wojcicki, Elon Musk[116] and Tobias Lütke,[117] as well as from companies such as Discovery, Verizon and Plants vs. Zombies.[118] Tobias Lütke, founder and CEO of Shopify, holds the record for the highest donation at 1,000,001 trees planted.[119] As of February 11, 2023, the original goal of 20 million trees has been far surpassed, with over 24.3 million trees in the ground.[120]\n\n\n\n### Beast Philanthropy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Greenville received Thanksgiving meals as part of an initiative by Beast Philanthropy and Jennie-O.[121][122]\nOn September 17, 2020, the YouTube channel Beast Philanthropy was created.[123] On the channel's first video, Donaldson announced the charity and food bank and named Darren Margolias, who had appeared in previous videos, as executive director.[24][124] According to the channel description, 100% of its advertising revenue, brand deals and merchandise sales are donated to charity.[19][123]\n\n\nNotable initiatives by Beast Philanthropy include giving away 10,000 turkeys to his hometown Greenville,[121][122] donating 20,000 shoes to children in Africa,[125] and gifting $300,000 worth of technology to various schools.[126]\n\n\n\n### Team Seas[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Team Seas\n\n![](image)Team Seas\nOn October 29, 2021, Donaldson and Rober organized another collaborative challenge event on YouTube titled #TeamSeas. The goal of this project was to raise $30 million for the Ocean Conservancy and The Ocean Cleanup by January 1, 2022. The $30 million goal would fund the removal of 30 million pounds of plastic and other waste from oceans, rivers, and beaches. Donaldson and Rober enlisted thousands of content creators, including AzzyLand, DanTDM, TommyInnit, LinusTechTips, TierZoo, LEMMiNO, The Infographics Show, Hannah Stocking, Dhar Mann and Marques Brownlee, and partnered with BEN and TubeBuddy's initiative of eight million global creators, to promote the fundraiser.[127][128][129]\n\n\n\n### Cataract surgery[edit]\n\n\nIn a video published in January 2023 titled \"1,000 Blind People See For The First Time\", Donaldson paid for cataract surgery for a thousand people who had severely limited vision and had been unable to afford the procedure.[130] Responses to his video on the subject ranged from praise at its intention to spread awareness to criticism that he was creating \"charity porn\" motivated solely by profit.[131] Other comments criticized the American medical system for failing to provide the necessary healthcare to the patients in the video, questioning why patients had to rely on a YouTuber for the procedure.[132]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nDonaldson describes himself as an introvert. Donaldson admits to having difficulty maintaining a social life due to his obsession with YouTube and his intense work ethic. Donaldson's mother, Sue, attributes his withdrawn lifestyle to their frequent relocations and his struggles with Crohn's disease.[133]\n\n\nDonaldson dated Maddy Spidell, a YouTuber, from 2019 to 2022. He has dated Thea Booysen, a gaming streamer, since 2022.[134][135]\n\n\nIn June 2023, Donaldson stated that he was invited to go on a tourist expedition to view the wreck of the *Titanic* in the OceanGate submersible *Titan* but declined the offer.[136] The submersible imploded in the Atlantic Ocean, killing all five aboard.[137]\n\n\n\n### Personal views[edit]\n\n\nIn an April 2022 interview with *The Daily Beast*, Donaldson announced that he was no longer an evangelical Christian and identified himself as an agnostic. He also stated that he had long disagreed with the church's position on homosexuality. He states that during the time he grew up in \"the heart of the Bible Belt\", he had religion \"beat into [his] head every day\", and was taught that \"gay people are the reason God's going to come and burn this Earth\". Although he considered anti-LGBT rhetoric to be normal growing up, he has disavowed it since then, stating: \"I realized, 'Oh, this isn't normal. This is just a weird place I grew up in.' So, that type of thing, I [wish I could] go back in time and be like, 'Hey, stop'.\"[133][138]\n\n\nDonaldson considers himself strictly apolitical, saying that \"I don't want to alienate Republicans and Democrats. ... I like having it where everyone can support charity. My goal is to feed hundreds of millions of people ... it would be very silly of me to alienate basically half of America.\"[133] On a podcast in September 2022, Donaldson has commented he would consider a run for president of the United States \"in like 20 years\", adding that the U.S. is \"due for younger presidents\".[139][140]\n\n\n\n## Public image[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | This section **needs expansion** with: a more detailed description of his popularity and public image. You can help by adding to it. *(October 2023)*\n |\n\n\n![](image)MrBeast's large model gumball machine at Vidcon 2022\nOpinion polls have shown that Donaldson is one of the most well-liked YouTubers on the platform. A 2021 SurveyMonkey poll showed that 70% of respondents have a favorable view of him, compared to 12% who had an unfavorable view.[141] In 2023, *Time* listed him on their *Time 100* list; fellow YouTuber and former NASA engineer Mark Rober wrote on his entry: \"He's constantly raising the bar for creators whether it's through re-creating *Squid Game* in real life or paying for the eye surgeries of 1,000 blind people. He doesn't really understand small thinking or complacency. I don't know what he'll do 10 years down the road, but I know it won't be status quo.\"[142] In 2023, CBC News noted that MrBeast's \"viral videos have stoked a wide range of reaction, from acclaim for their altruism to controversy for perceived exploitation.\"[143]\n\n\nIn October 2018, *The Atlantic* published an article on Donaldson's history of using homophobic slurs.[61][144][145] The article stated that Donaldson, while still a teenager, had had a habit of referring to people as \"fags\" on Twitter and regularly treated being homosexual as a punchline in jokes and \"gay\" as an insult.[144] Donaldson later removed the tweets, and in 2021, a spokesperson for Donaldson said that the YouTuber had \"grown up and matured into someone that doesn't speak like that\".[146]\n\n\nIn 2023, Donaldson's childhood friend and employee, Kris (formerly Chris) Tyson, came out as transgender. When a critic tweeted that her transition would be a “nightmare” for the influencer, Donaldson replied, “Yeah, this is getting absurd. Chris isn’t my ‘nightmare’ he’s my friend and things are fine. All this transphobia is starting to piss me off.”[147][148][149]\n\n\nDuring a Clubhouse room in February 2021, Donaldson booted entrepreneur Farokh Sarmad after he allegedly said he could not pronounce his name, a move that Sarmad later said was racist. Sarmad's claims were questioned and denied by other Clubhouse users, who were present at the call who argued against Sarmad's claims, claiming that Donaldson removed him along with others to make room for women to be more inclusive.[150][151]\n\n\n\n## Filmography[edit]\n\n\n\n\nFilm\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2023\n | *Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem* | Times Square Bystander\n |  | [152] |\n| *Under the Boardwalk* | Hot Sauce Crab\n |  |  |\n\n\n## Awards and nominations[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Ceremony\n | Category\n | Result\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2019\n | 9th Streamy Awards | Breakout Creator\n | Won\n | [153] |\n| Ensemble Cast\n | Nominated\n |\n| Creator of the Year\n | Nominated\n |\n| 2020\n | 12th Annual Shorty Awards | YouTuber of the Year\n | Won\n |  |\n| 10th Streamy Awards | Creator of the Year\n | Won\n | [154][155] |\n| Live Special\n | Won\n |\n| Social Good: Creator\n | Won\n |\n| Social Good: Nonprofit or NGO\n | Won\n |\n| 2021\n | 2021 Kids' Choice Awards | Favorite Male Social Star\n | Nominated\n | [156] |\n| 11th Streamy Awards | Creator of the Year\n | Won\n | [157] |\n| 2022\n | 2022 Kids' Choice Awards | Favorite Male Creator\n | Won\n | [158] |\n| 12th Streamy Awards | Creator of the Year\n | Won\n | [159][160] |\n| Collaboration\n | Nominated\n |\n| Social Good: Creator[d] | Won\n |\n| Creator Product\n | Nominated\n |\n| Editing\n | Nominated\n |\n| Brand Engagement[d] | Won\n |\n| Social Impact Campaign[d] | Nominated\n |\n| 2023\n | 2023 Kids' Choice Awards | Favorite Male Creator\n | Won\n | [161] |\n| 13th Streamy Awards | Creator of the Year\n | Won\n | [162] |\n| Collaboration\n | Won\n |\n| Creator Product\n | Nominated\n |\n| Brand Engagement\n | Nominated\n |\n\n\n### World records[edit]\n\n\n\n\nName of publication, year the record was awarded, name of the record, and the name of the record holder\n| Publication\n | Year\n | World record\n | Record holder\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| *Guinness World Records* | 2021\n | Highest-earning YouTube contributor (current)\n | MrBeast\n | [163] |\n| 2022\n | Largest vegetarian burger\n | [164] |\n| Most subscribers for an individual male on YouTube\n | Jimmy Donaldson\n | [165] |\n| 2023\n | First person to reach 1 million followers on Threads | MrBeast\n | [166] |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of YouTubers\n* List of most-subscribed YouTube channels\n* Night Media\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Only the six main channels are included: MrBeast, MrBeast Gaming, Beast Reacts, MrBeast 2 (formerly MrBeast Shorts), Beast Philanthropy and MrBeast 3 (formerly MrBeast 2).\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Sources conflict on the spelling of Donaldson's middle name.

Cocomelon specializes in 3D animation videos of both traditional nursery rhymes and their own original children's songs.\n\n\n\n\n## Content[edit]\n\n\nCocomelon's videos feature children, adults, and animals who interact with each other in daily life. The lyrics appear at the bottom of the screen in the same way on all displays. In 2020, Treasure Studio added Cocomelon content to Netflix, Roku, and Hulu.[2][3] The company also delivers music through popular streaming services.[4] YouTube's content consists of standalone music videos, compilations, and livestreams.\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Videos[edit]\n\n\n#### checkgate aka ThatsMeOnTV.com (2006–2013)[edit]\n\n\nOn September 1, 2006, Cocomelon was created on YouTube to provide free education and entertainment for the founder of Cocomelon, Jay Jeon, his wife, his children. Then known as \"checkgate\",[5] the channel uploaded two versions of the alphabet song to YouTube on their first day.[6] The channel uploaded their third video 9 months later, titled \"Learning ABC Alphabet – Letter \"K\" — Kangaroo Game\". Most videos on the channel taught the alphabet, with a typical length of between one and two minutes.\n\n\n\n#### ABC Kid TV (2013–2018)[edit]\n\n\nIn 2013, after several years of making content for Jay Jeon's children, Treasure Studio began the ABC Kid TV era which introduced a new intro and logo to start a fresh new look to expand their brand. The logo showed a TV with a ladybug in the upper left corner. The channel began remastering older videos, followed by a transition from alphabet videos to nursery rhymes and longer video lengths. Within a few years, the channel introduced computer animation, with their first 3D character being used in *Twinkle Twinkle Little Star* on April 8, 2016. The video featured a 3D flying star guiding 2D characters through the sky. Towards the end of 2016, 3D animation video uploads became more frequent and longer, with some videos using motion capture technology. Animation and music production continued to modernize, and a recurring cast of characters formed before the 2018 rebrand. [*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n#### Cocomelon (2018–present)[edit]\n\n\nIn summer 2018, the channel rebranded again to Cocomelon, introducing a new intro and outro to all their videos. They also added the logo of a watermelon stylized to resemble a traditional box TV, while retaining the ladybug as part of the opening and closing sequences.\n\n\nIn April 2019, *The Wall Street Journal* estimated Cocomelon's yearly ad revenue at $120 million.[7] In late 2020, Cocomelon added content in Spanish and Portuguese.[8][9] Early in 2021, they also added Mandarin Chinese, German, and Arabic.[10][11][12]\n\n\nNina Reyes, who first appeared on the show in 2019, got her own show *Nina's Familia*, a bilingual series following the format of the original, with educational songs and nursery rhymes. The spinoff, to start September 29, 2023, was intended both for children who knew Spanish and for those who did not, and care was taken to make sure Latino culture was well represented.[13]\n\n\nIn July 2020, Jeon sold his company, Treasure Studio, to Moonbug, which had been founded just two years earlier.[14] Moonbug expanded the show to more audiences, inking deals with platforms in South Korea, China, and Europe. \n\n\n\n### Merchandise[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2020, the company's chief executive announced plans to introduce toys based on these characters and has mentioned the possibility of a feature-length film. The toys are expected to include plush dolls and toy vehicles, with an anticipated rollout date in the fall of 2020.[15] Shipment of some toys was later announced for August.[16][17] In December, the company began selling apparel through their website directly.[18]\n\n\n\n### Rise in popularity[edit]\n\n\nAfter nine years on YouTube, Cocomelon reached 1 million subscribers on May 16, 2016. Half a month later, the channel reached one billion total views. The following two years continued to grow with nearly 400,000 subscribers per month to ten million subscribers, and the channel reached seven billion total views. They started increasing rapidly with the release of \"Yes Yes\" Bedtime Song, a video in which TomTom has to use stuffed animals to get JJ to prepare for bed, which was released in July 2017 and became their most viewed video, currently over 1 billion views.\n\n\nCocomelon had the second-largest YouTube channel subscriptions gain in 2019 with an increase of over 36 million, ending the year on 67.4 million in channel subscriptions.[19] In 2018, YouTube's algorithm recommended Cocomelon's video \"Bath Song + More Nursery Rhymes & Kids Songs\" 650 times \"among the 696,468 suggestions that Pew Research Center tracked\" making it the most recommended video on YouTube.[20] As of September 2020, that video has received over 3.2 billion views on YouTube, making it the 19th-most viewed video on the site.[21] In addition, their second-most popular video, \"Yes Yes Vegetables Song\", has received over 2.5 billion views, making it the 36th-most viewed video on the site.[21]\n\n\nBetween May and June 2019, Cocomelon received 2.5 billion total views, averaging 83 million daily viewers. Comparatively, the \"major four TV broadcast networks averaged just 13 million viewers daily during the TV season\".[22] In July 2019, YouTube changed its algorithm after the Federal Trade Commission raised concerns over child safety. Several children's channels were affected, including Cocomelon, which \"dropped from 575 million total views the week before the change, to 436 million the week of, to 307 million the week after, and 282 million the week after that\".[23]\n\n\nOn December 12, 2020, Cocomelon became the third YouTube channel in the world to get 100 million subscribers.\n\n\nCocomelon's videos also achieved popularity outside YouTube; in September 2020 Netflix ranked *Cocomelon* as its third most popular show.[24]\n\n\nCocomelon was ranked #1 on Reelgood's list of Netflix shows for 2020, ahead of *The Office* and *The Queen's Gambit*.[25]\n\n\nIt was predicted Cocomelon would surpass PewDiePie at some point in April–May 2021, becoming the second-most subscribed YouTube channel.[26][27][28] In response to this, PewDiePie released \"Coco,\" a diss track targeted at Cocomelon on February 14, 2021. The video was removed from YouTube shortly after its upload. YouTube cited its harassment and cyberbullying policy as the reason for the video being taken down.[29][30] Two months later, on April 25, 2021, Cocomelon surpassed PewDiePie as predicted. The song remains on major streaming platforms.\n\n\nCocomelon has been involved in the Riyadh Season 2021 show in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, where the companies Spacetoon Event and Moonbug Entertainment collaborated with the Saudi General Entertainment Authority to bring the Cocomelon Town show for 3 months.[31][32]\n\n\nOn September 28, 2023, Netflix released a teaser for a new original series based on the franchise titled *Cocomelon Lane*. It is set to debut on Netflix on November 17, 2023.\n\n\n\n## Telecast[edit]\n\n\nCocomelon has aired on Universal Kids since June 21, 2021, and Cartoon Network's Cartoonito block since January 31, 2022.[33] Cocomelon also premiered on SAB TV in Pakistan on March 29, 2021,[*citation needed*] Cartoonito in the United Kingdom on April 4, 2021, BBC iPlayer in the United Kingdom on June 18, 2021, Tiny Pop in the United Kingdom on November 15, 2021, TV5 in the Philippines as part of Moonbug Kids since September 2022, and Gulli in France since November 7, 2022.[34] Cocomelon also airs on RTÉ Jr Radio.\n\n\n\n### Netflix Original series[edit]\n\n\nNetflix has been airing CoComelon episodes as acquired programming but starting with season 6 the show gained the Netflix Original billing.\n\n\n\n\n\n| No.overall | No. inseason | Title | Original release date |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Season 6** |\n| 1 | 1 | \"Fun with Family and Friends\" | September 5, 2022 (2022-09-05) |\n| **Season 7** |\n| 2 | 1 | \"It's Cody Time\" | February 15, 2023 (2023-02-15) |\n| 3 | 2 | \"Happy Days\" | February 15, 2023 (2023-02-15) |\n| 4 | 3 | \"Wild Imagination\" | February 15, 2023 (2023-02-15) |\n| **Season 8** |\n| 5 | 1 | \"Learning with JJ\" | April 10, 2023 (2023-04-10) |\n\n\n## Concerns[edit]\n\n\nNews media have expressed concern over the anonymous nature of the channel and its visually intense content.\n\n\n\n### Identity of original owners[edit]\n\n\nCocomelon's website has described the company as having 20 employees.[6] When *The Wall Street Journal* attempted to find out who creates Cocomelon videos, they were unable to contact Treasure Studio, which owns the channel.[35] *Wired* magazine located a couple in Irvine, California who seemed to have some ties with Treasure Studio but was unable to confirm that they owned the channel.[36] In February 2020, *Bloomberg Businessweek* identified a couple from Orange County, California as the owners of Treasure Studio and Cocomelon.[37] In mid-2020, Cocomelon was purchased by the children's new media conglomerate Moonbug.[17] In 2022, Moonbug was itself acquired by Candle Media, owned by two former Disney executives.[38]\n\n\n\n### Content[edit]\n\n\nThe *New York Times* has discussed Cocomelon's focus on maintaining children's attention. Jordy Kaufman, a media researcher who runs the Babylab research facility at the Swinburne University of Technology in Melbourne, Australia was quoted as saying that the effect of screen time on child development is \"a big question without clear answers.\"[38]\n\n\n\n## Controversy[edit]\n\n\nOn 1 August 2023, Moonbug Entertainment was awarded US$23.4 million in a copyright case involving against Fuzhou-based company BabyBus, accused of \"blatantly copying\" Cocomelon videos.[39]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of most-subscribed YouTube channels\n* List of most-viewed YouTube channels\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"About Cocomelon - Nursery Rhymes\".

Several children's channels were affected, including Cocomelon, which \"dropped from 575 million total views the week before the change, to 436 million the week of, to 307 million the week after, and 282 million the week after that\".[23]\n\n\nOn December 12, 2020, Cocomelon became the third YouTube channel in the world to get 100 million subscribers.\n\n\nCocomelon's videos also achieved popularity outside YouTube; in September 2020 Netflix ranked *Cocomelon* as its third most popular show.[24]\n\n\nCocomelon was ranked #1 on Reelgood's list of Netflix shows for 2020, ahead of *The Office* and *The Queen's Gambit*.[25]\n\n\nIt was predicted Cocomelon would surpass PewDiePie at some point in April–May 2021, becoming the second-most subscribed YouTube channel.[26][27][28] In response to this, PewDiePie released \"Coco,\" a diss track targeted at Cocomelon on February 14, 2021. The video was removed from YouTube shortly after its upload. YouTube cited its harassment and cyberbullying policy as the reason for the video being taken down.[29][30] Two months later, on April 25, 2021, Cocomelon surpassed PewDiePie as predicted. The song remains on major streaming platforms.\n\n\nCocomelon has been involved in the Riyadh Season 2021 show in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, where the companies Spacetoon Event and Moonbug Entertainment collaborated with the Saudi General Entertainment Authority to bring the Cocomelon Town show for 3 months.[31][32]\n\n\nOn September 28, 2023, Netflix released a teaser for a new original series based on the franchise titled *Cocomelon Lane*. It is set to debut on Netflix on November 17, 2023.\n\n\n\n## Telecast[edit]\n\n\nCocomelon has aired on Universal Kids since June 21, 2021, and Cartoon Network's Cartoonito block since January 31, 2022.[33] Cocomelon also premiered on SAB TV in Pakistan on March 29, 2021,[*citation needed*] Cartoonito in the United Kingdom on April 4, 2021, BBC iPlayer in the United Kingdom on June 18, 2021, Tiny Pop in the United Kingdom on November 15, 2021, TV5 in the Philippines as part of Moonbug Kids since September 2022, and Gulli in France since November 7, 2022.[34] Cocomelon also airs on RTÉ Jr Radio.\n\n\n\n### Netflix Original series[edit]\n\n\nNetflix has been airing CoComelon episodes as acquired programming but starting with season 6 the show gained the Netflix Original billing.\n\n\n\n\n\n| No.overall | No. inseason | Title | Original release date |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Season 6** |\n| 1 | 1 | \"Fun with Family and Friends\" | September 5, 2022 (2022-09-05) |\n| **Season 7** |\n| 2 | 1 | \"It's Cody Time\" | February 15, 2023 (2023-02-15) |\n| 3 | 2 | \"Happy Days\" | February 15, 2023 (2023-02-15) |\n| 4 | 3 | \"Wild Imagination\" | February 15, 2023 (2023-02-15) |\n| **Season 8** |\n| 5 | 1 | \"Learning with JJ\" | April 10, 2023 (2023-04-10) |\n\n\n## Concerns[edit]\n\n\nNews media have expressed concern over the anonymous nature of the channel and its visually intense content.\n\n\n\n### Identity of original owners[edit]\n\n\nCocomelon's website has described the company as having 20 employees.[6] When *The Wall Street Journal* attempted to find out who creates Cocomelon videos, they were unable to contact Treasure Studio, which owns the channel.[35] *Wired* magazine located a couple in Irvine, California who seemed to have some ties with Treasure Studio but was unable to confirm that they owned the channel.[36] In February 2020, *Bloomberg Businessweek* identified a couple from Orange County, California as the owners of Treasure Studio and Cocomelon.[37] In mid-2020, Cocomelon was purchased by the children's new media conglomerate Moonbug.[17] In 2022, Moonbug was itself acquired by Candle Media, owned by two former Disney executives.[38]\n\n\n\n### Content[edit]\n\n\nThe *New York Times* has discussed Cocomelon's focus on maintaining children's attention. Jordy Kaufman, a media researcher who runs the Babylab research facility at the Swinburne University of Technology in Melbourne, Australia was quoted as saying that the effect of screen time on child development is \"a big question without clear answers.\"[38]\n\n\n\n## Controversy[edit]\n\n\nOn 1 August 2023, Moonbug Entertainment was awarded US$23.4 million in a copyright case involving against Fuzhou-based company BabyBus, accused of \"blatantly copying\" Cocomelon videos.[39]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of most-subscribed YouTube channels\n* List of most-viewed YouTube channels\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"About Cocomelon - Nursery Rhymes\".
