Schwarber's home run was the tenth given up by Verlander in the World Series, passing Catfish Hunter for the most allowed in World Series history.[67] Pe\u00f1a hit a home run to put the Astros ahead at 2\u20131 in the fourth inning, becoming the first rookie shortstop to hit a home run in the World Series. The Phillies, who had put runners in scoring position throughout the next four innings, did not score another run off of Verlander, who finished his appearance with six strikeouts and four walks allowed in five innings. In the top of the eighth inning, Altuve scored from third base on a ground out by Yordan \u00c1lvarez, widening the Astros' lead to 3\u20131. In the bottom of the eighth inning, Nick Castellanos scored on an RBI single by Jean Segura, narrowing the Phillies' deficit and putting runners on the corners. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1950 | 1951 | 1952 | 1953 | 1954 | 1955 | 1956 | 1957 | 1958 | 1959 |\n |\n| 1960s | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1960 | 1961 | 1962 | 1963 | 1964 | 1965 | 1966 | 1967 | 1968 | 1969 |\n |\n| 1970s | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1970 | 1971 | 1972 | 1973 | 1974 | 1975 | 1976 | 1977 | 1978 | 1979 |\n |\n| 1980s | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1980 | 1981 | 1982 | 1983 | 1984 | 1985 | 1986 | 1987 | 1988 | 1989 |\n |\n| 1990s | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1990 | 1991 | 1992 | 1993 | ~~1994~~ | 1995 | 1996 | 1997 | 1998 | 1999 |\n |\n| 2000s | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNovember 3, 2022 8:03\u00a0pm (EDT) at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 59\u00a0\u00b0F (15\u00a0\u00b0C), clear\n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Houston** | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 3 | 9 | 0\n |\n| Philadelphia | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 2 | 6 | 1\n |\n| **WP:** Justin Verlander (1\u20130) \u00a0 **LP:** Noah Syndergaard (0\u20131) \u00a0 **Sv:** Ryan Pressly (1)**Home runs:**HOU: Jeremy Pe\u00f1a (1)PHI: Kyle Schwarber (2)**Attendance:** 45,693Boxscore |\n\n\nBefore Game 5, Meek Mill performed a song on the field and rode with the Phillie Phanatic on an ATV.[61] Philadelphia native Jazmine Sullivan performed the national anthem[62] and Brad Lidge threw the ceremonial first pitch to Carlos Ruiz.[63] Noah Syndergaard started for the Phillies[64] and Justin Verlander started for the Astros.[65] The Phillies donned powder blue throwback uniforms from the 1970s and 1980s while the Astros wore their orange jerseys.[66]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* SportsTime Ohio (Cleveland Indians)\n* YES Network (New York Yankees)\n |\n| Fox/MyTVO&O Stations | * New York City: WNYW 5 (Yankees, *1999\u20132001*), WWOR 9 (N.Y.

Jorge Soler was awarded the World Series Most Valuable Player Award after batting .300 in the series with home runs in three of the Braves victories, each time giving them a lead they would never surrender.\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2021 Major League Baseball postseason\n\nThe team with the better regular-season winning percentage, the Houston Astros, had home field advantage in the series, thus hosting Games 1, 2, and 6 (and would have hosted Game 7 if needed).[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Astros and Braves had previously met in the postseason five times, in the National League Division Series when the Astros competed in the National League.[3] Of those five series, the Braves won three (1997, 1999, and 2001) while the Astros won two (2004 and 2005).[3] The Astros and Braves played in the National League West from 1969-1993.\n\n\nThe teams' jerseys lacked a World Series patch for the first time since 1997, though a patch was on their caps.[4]\n\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nManagers Dusty Baker of the Astros (left) and Brian Snitker of the Braves\n\n### Atlanta Braves[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2021 Atlanta Braves season\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n61. **^** \"Soler clears train tracks for massive 3-run HR\". *MLB.com*.

In Atlanta, WCNN and WAOS broadcast in English and Spanish respectively, KBME (in English) and KLAT (in Spanish) aired the games in the Houston market. Outside of those stations, MLB rules dictated that team-affiliated stations carry the ESPN Radio broadcasts of the games.[80]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nKendall Graveman pitched the final two innings for Houston, holding the four-run lead as the Astros avoided elimination and sent the series back to Houston.[53]\n\n\nZack Greinke singled for Houston in the fourth inning as a pinch hitter, becoming the first pitcher with a pinch hit in a World Series game since Jack Bentley of the New York Giants in 1923.[54] Game 5 of the 2021 World Series marked the last game to date in which the designated hitter rule was not used. Starting in 2022, the National League added the DH permanently.[55] This makes Greinke the last pitcher to date to get a hit in the postseason (pitchers such as Shohei Ohtani have since gotten hits in the regular season). Additionally, Freeman's home run in this game is the furthest-hit home run in the World Series since the beginning of distance tracking in 2015, at 460 feet.[56]\n\n\n\n### Game 6[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Max Fried pitched six scoreless innings in Game 6 and earned the win.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Related articles | * Major League Baseball on the radio\n* Home Run Derby\n* MLB Little League Classic\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n2021 MLB season by team\n |\n| --- |\n| |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| AL East | * Baltimore\n* Boston\n* New York\n* Tampa Bay\n* Toronto\n |\n| AL Central | * Chicago\n* Cleveland\n* Detroit\n* Kansas City\n* Minnesota\n |\n| AL West | * Houston\n* Los Angeles\n* Oakland\n* Seattle\n* Texas\n |\n\n | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| NL East | * Atlanta\n* Miami\n* New York\n* Philadelphia\n* Washington\n |\n| NL Central | * Chicago\n* Cincinnati\n* Milwaukee\n* Pittsburgh\n* St. Louis\n |\n| NL West | * Arizona\n* Colorado\n* Los Angeles\n* San Diego\n* San Francisco\n |\n\n |\n |\n| * 2021 MLB draft\n* 2021 All-Star Game\n* MLB at Field of Dreams\n* 2021 MLB Little League Classic\n* 2021 World Series\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBaker became the ninth manager to win both American and National League pennants (having won the latter with the San Francisco Giants in 2002).[16] Baker's gap of 19 years between appearances in the World Series is surpassed only by Bucky Harris, who managed in the 1925 and 1947 editions.[16] At 72 years and 4 months old, Baker became the second-oldest manager in World Series history, the oldest having been Jack McKeon of the Florida Marlins in 2003, who was seven months older.[17] Astros' hitting coach Troy Snitker is the son of Brian Snitker, the Braves manager.[18] As a player, Baker was drafted by the Atlanta Braves in 1967 and spent seven seasons there.\n\n\nThis was the Astros' third World Series appearance in five years, having appeared in 2017 and 2019, and fourth overall, having also appeared in 2005 when they represented the National League.[10] Their only prior World Series title came in 2017.[10]\n\n\n\n## Summary[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nMinute Maid Park (top) and Truist Park\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nUnder second-year manager Dusty Baker, the Houston Astros qualified for the postseason as the American League West division winner, having finished atop the division for the fourth time in five seasons.[11] In the best-of-five American League Division Series, the second-seeded Astros defeated the Chicago White Sox in four games.[12] In the best-of-seven American League Championship Series (ALCS), the Astros defeated the Boston Red Sox in six games,[13] with designated hitter Yordan \u00c1lvarez named ALCS MVP after batting 12-for-23 (.522) in the series.[14] Starting pitcher Lance McCullers Jr., who missed the ALCS due to a forearm strain suffered during the ALDS, was omitted from Houston's World Series roster due to that injury.[15]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nTyler Matzek entered in relief in the bottom of the seventh; Fried allowed no runs on four hits while striking out six batters and walking none in six innings. Atlanta closer Will Smith was brought in to pitch the bottom of the ninth. He allowed a leadoff single to Michael Brantley and retired the next three batters, the last out being a Yuli Gurriel infield grounder fielded by Swanson, who threw to Freeman, giving the Braves the title.[62] With this final inning, Will Smith finished off a postseason in which he closed 11 of 16 Braves games while allowing no runs. Jorge Soler won the World Series Most Valuable Player Award.[63]\n\n\nWith the World Series victory, Joc Pederson became a back-to-back World Series winner on two different teams, joining names like Jack Morris, Ryan Theriot, Jake Peavy and Ben Zobrist who previously accomplished that feat.[64] Pederson had become a fan-favorite throughout his three-month stay in Atlanta, particularly for his preference to wear pearls.[65]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Culture | * AstroTurf\n* Orbit\n* Crawford Boxes\n* Tal's Hill\n* Union Station\n* Big Bamboo Lounge\n* Continental League\n* \"Deep in the Heart of Texas\"\n* Houston Buffs\n* Shriners College Classic\n* *Ball Four*\n* *Brewster McCloud*\n* *The Bad News Bears in Breaking Training*\n* *Murder at the World Series*\n* *Night Game*\n* \"The Hot Tub\" (*Seinfeld* episode)\n* *Boyhood*\n* *Resurrection: The J.R.

The bullpen was dominant throughout the postseason with the late-inning combination of Will Smith, Tyler Matzek, Luke Jackson, and A.J. Minter leading the way. Closer Will Smith struggled at times during the regular season having posted a 3.44 ERA, particularly with a 5.40 ERA during the dog days of a close NL East division race in August. Those struggles however disappeared for Smith in the postseason as the veteran reliever worked 11 consecutive scoreless innings in October allowing only five hits, three walks, and eight strikeouts with six saves.[86] As it turned out, 2021 would be the last full season the bullpen was together as Smith was traded to Houston at the 2022 trade deadline, Jackson suffered an elbow injury in April 2022, and Matzek had a similar injury before the start of the 2022 postseason in October. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Dates | October 26 \u2013 November 2 |\n| Venue | Truist Park (Atlanta) Minute Maid Park (Houston) |\n| MVP | Jorge Soler (Atlanta) |\n| Umpires | Ted Barrett, Dan Bellino, Chris Conroy, Tom Hallion (crew chief), Ron Kulpa, Alfonso M\u00e1rquez, Mike Muchlinski[1] |\n| Broadcast |\n| Television | Fox (United States \u2013 English)Fox Deportes (United States \u2013 Spanish)MLB International (International) |\n| TV announcers | Joe Buck, John Smoltz, Ken Rosenthal and Tom Verducci (Fox)Adrian Garcia Marquez, Edgar Gonzalez and Carlos \u00c1lvarez (Fox Deportes)Scott Braun and Dan Plesac (MLB International) |\n| Radio | ESPN (United States \u2013 English)TUDN (United States \u2013 Spanish)WCNN (ATL \u2013 English)WAOS (ATL \u2013 Spanish)KBME (HOU \u2013 English)KLAT (HOU \u2013 Spanish) |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n90. **^** \"ESPN signs Buck, Aikman to be new MNF voices\". *ESPN.com*.

Additionally, the Dodgers and Rays combined for a .692 winning percentage in the regular season, the highest combined regular-season winning percentage for a World Series matchup ever, surpassing the 1906 World Series between the Cubs and White Sox (.690).[23]\n\n\nThis was the first World Series to feature two cities that held either the NBA or the NHL title the same year, as the Los Angeles Lakers won the 2020 NBA Finals on October 11 and the Tampa Bay Lightning won the 2020 Stanley Cup Finals on September 28.[24] With the Tampa Bay Buccaneers qualifying and eventually winning Super Bowl LV the following winter, Tampa's NHL, MLB and NFL teams all made the championship round within a six-month span.[25]\n\n\nThis was the first World Series since 1993 to have all games played on artificial turf.[26]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Dodgers were the first team since the 2010 San Francisco Giants to win a World Series with fully homegrown rotation starting every postseason game.\n\n\nWith the World Series win, the only team to beat the Dodgers in a series in 2020 was the Rockies, who won two out of three at Dodger Stadium in early September.[76] With the best record in baseball, the Dodgers were also just the seventh team in the Wild Card Era (since 1995) to have at least a share of the best record in baseball and win the World Series, joining the 2018 Red Sox, '16 Cubs, '13 Red Sox, '09 Yankees, '07 Red Sox and '98 Yankees on that list.[77] Because of an expanded 16-team postseason field, the Dodgers' 13 postseason wins were the most in MLB history.[78] This would later be matched by the Texas Rangers in 2023.\n\n\n\n### Series statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Tampa Bay Rays of the American League made their second appearance in the World Series in franchise history and their first since 2008. They finished the shortened regular season with a 40\u201320 (.667) record, the best in the American League. They then swept the Toronto Blue Jays in two games in the Wild Card Series, defeated the New York Yankees in five games in the Division Series, and defeated the Houston Astros in seven games after leading 3\u20130 in the American League Championship Series (ALCS).[13][14] Randy Arozarena hit seven home runs in 14 postseason games prior to the World Series, becoming the first rookie position player to ever win the ALCS Most Valuable Player Award. After his performance in the World Series, Arozarena would break records in home runs, hits, and total bases in a single postseason.[15][16]\n\n\n\n### Los Angeles Dodgers[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2020 Los Angeles Dodgers season\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Regular season | * 1998 Major League Baseball home run record chase\n* Philip Humber's perfect game (2012)\n* London Series\n\t+ 2019\n* MLB at Field of Dreams (2021)\n* Curse of the Bambino\n* Yankees\u2013Red Sox rivalry\n |\n| Postseason games | * The Flip Play (2001)\n* Steve Bartman (2003)\n* The 53-Minute 7th Inning (2015)\n* Chicago Cubs end the Billy Goat curse (2016)\n* Jos\u00e9 Bautista's bat flip\n |\n| World Series games | * The last night of the New York Yankees dynasty (2001)\n* Game 6 of the 2011 World Series\n* Walk-off obstruction (2013)\n* Game 5 of the 2017 World Series (2017)\n* Houston Astros sign stealing scandal (2017)\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n116th edition of Major League Baseball's championship series\n\nThis article is about baseball's World Series.

It was also the first World Series since 1984 to use the designated hitter for all games.[2][3] With 2020 being the inaugural season for Globe Life Field, it became the first ballpark to host the World Series in its first year since Yankee Stadium in 2009.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* *Sunday Night Baseball*\n |\n| Commentators | * All-Star Game\n* Wild Card Round\n* ALCS\n* ALDS\n* NLCS\n* NLDS\n* World Series\n* *Game of the Week*\n |\n| Lore | * 1998 MLB home run record chase\n* Grand Slam Single (1999)\n* Death of Osama bin Laden (2011)\n* Fort Bragg Game (2016)\n* London Series\n* MLB at Field of Dreams (2021)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n63. **^** Horowicz, Michael [@Michaelhorowicz] (October 26, 2020). \"@buckweaver @jphoornstra Charley Steiner points out that with the stands mostly empty, Kershaw could hear his teammates in the dugout with the early warning\" (Tweet).

Despite tweeting that he was asymptomatic, Turner nevertheless took part in the celebration after the Dodgers had won the game, violating MLB protocols.[71] He was the first player to test positive for the virus during the postseason bubble.[72][73] The next day, Major League Baseball announced that Turner would be under investigation.[74] On November 6, Turner apologized for the incident and received no punishment from Rob Manfred, who admitted that MLB could have handled the situation better.[75]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLos Angeles would lose core members to their 2020 championship core over the next few seasons, losing Joc Pederson and Kik\u00e9 Hernandez in free agency in 2020, Corey Seager and Kenley Jansen in free agency in 2021, Justin Turner in free agency in 2022, and non-tendering Cody Bellinger in 2022. Younger members of the team would also experience serious injuries, such as Walker Buehler, Tony Gonsolin, and Dustin May undergoing Tommy John surgery, and Gavin Lux losing a season due to a broken leg. Because of this, the Dodgers once vaulted depth would suffer. They would remain an excellent regular season team, but were upset each of the next three seasons.

It was the third World Series in which home-field advantage was decided by the regular-season records of the American and National league champions, a practice that started in the 2017 season. It was the first World Series in which the Houston Astros had home-field advantage. The series was played in a 2\u20133\u20132 format, with the Astros hosting Games 1, 2, 6, and 7; and the Nationals hosting Games 3, 4, and 5.\n\n\nFor the first time in any of the major North American sports leagues, the visiting team won all the games of a seven-game championship series,[6] surpassing the previous high of five.[7] The road team outscored the home team 49\u201314 in the seven games played. Washington won despite scoring only three runs at home.

The Nationals were also the last team from the 1969 expansion class (which also included the Kansas City Royals, Milwaukee Brewers\u2014who began as the Seattle Pilots\u2014and San Diego Padres) to earn a trip to the series. Also, after their World Series appearance, all National League (NL) teams had played in at least one World Series. The only American League (AL) team that has yet to play in a World Series is the Seattle Mariners, who were part of the 1977 expansion. Prior to this series, the Astros and Nationals had never played each other in a postseason series, even though Houston played in the NL from 1962 to 2012 before moving to the AL West in 2013. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n125. **^** Camerato, Jessica; Casella, Paul. \"Nats deal Max, Trea to LA for 4 prospects\". *MLB.com*.

After being knocked out by the Nationals in the National League Division Series, several Dodgers (the team the Astros beat in the 2017 World Series) reached out to Washington Nationals second baseman Brian Dozier, who had been with Los Angeles the previous year, to warn him that Houston was elaborately stealing signs. Many American League clubs also reached out to Washington to say the same as well.[121]\n\n\nShortly after the 2019 World Series concluded, on November 12, 2019, journalists Ken Rosenthal and Evan Drellich published a story in *The Athletic* detailing for the first time specific allegations that the Astros had engaged in illicit electronic sign stealing. MLB launched an investigation and found evidence that the Astros did engage in illegal electronic sign stealing in 2017 and 2018, but found no evidence that they used the scheme in 2019.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Culture | * AstroTurf\n* Orbit\n* Crawford Boxes\n* Tal's Hill\n* Union Station\n* Big Bamboo Lounge\n* Continental League\n* \"Deep in the Heart of Texas\"\n* Houston Buffs\n* Shriners College Classic\n* *Ball Four*\n* *Brewster McCloud*\n* *The Bad News Bears in Breaking Training*\n* *Murder at the World Series*\n* *Night Game*\n* \"The Hot Tub\" (*Seinfeld* episode)\n* *Boyhood*\n* *Resurrection: The J.R.

Second-year manager Dave Martinez began to receive public pressure to be fired by the Nationals.[12] The team engineered a turnaround and finished the season in second place in the National League East, four games behind the Atlanta Braves, ending the year with a 93\u201369 (.574) record.[13] The Nationals were one of two teams to qualify for the playoffs as a wild card team from the National League.[14] Martinez had missed three games in September for a cardiac catheterization procedure to treat angina.[15]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOctober 30, 2019 7:08\u00a0pm (CDT) at Minute Maid Park in Houston, Texas, 73\u00a0\u00b0F (23\u00a0\u00b0C), roof closed\n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Washington** | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 3 | 1 | 2 | 6 | 9 | 0\n |\n| Houston | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 9 | 1\n |\n| **WP:** Patrick Corbin (1\u20131) \u00a0 **LP:** Will Harris (0\u20131)**Home runs:**WAS: Anthony Rendon (2), Howie Kendrick (1)HOU: Yuli Gurriel (1)**Attendance:** 43,326Boxscore |\n\n\nThis was the 40th time a World Series reached its deciding Game 7.[86][note 7] The starting pitchers were Washington's Max Scherzer, who won Game\u00a01, and Houston's Zack Greinke, who received a no decision in Game\u00a03,[87] making this the first World Series Game\u00a07 started by two previous Cy Young Award winners.[88] Ceremonial first pitches were thrown by former Astros Jeff Bagwell and Craig Biggio.[89]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA two-run home run by Yordan \u00c1lvarez in the top of the second inning gave the Astros an early lead.

The Nationals let all-star third baseman Anthony Rendon leave in free agency to the Los Angeles Angels in the offseason (the Angels also signed 2019 Nationals part-time catcher Kurt Suzuki). The COVID-19 pandemic kept the Nationals from properly celebrating their 2019 championship the following season, as spectators were not allowed in the stands during the shortened season. They raised their championship banner in front of an empty Nationals Park on the first day of the 2020 season, and received their championship rings in the clubhouse rather than on the field in front of the fans.[122] The Nationals finished tied for last in the NL East in 2020. Postseason hero Howie Kendrick retired at the end of the season.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBy 2022, the Lerner family were reporting exploring a sale of the Nationals.[127] Later that year at the trade deadline, the team traded superstar Juan Soto, after he rejected a reported 14-year extension,[128] to San Diego for young players and prospects.[129] Before the start of the 2023 season, patriarch Ted Lerner died at the age of 97. \n\n\nBecause of the trades at the 2021-2022 trade deadlines, the Nationals were surprisingly competitive for much of 2023, despite fielding one of the youngest rosters in baseball.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Baseball portal\n\n\n* 2019 Japan Series\n* 2019 Korean Series\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLeading off the top of the seventh, Kurt Suzuki hit a home run to put the Nationals ahead, 3\u20132. Verlander exited one batter later; he was charged with four runs on seven hits while striking out six batters, and was later assessed the loss. Washington scored five more runs in the seventh off Ryan Pressly, extending their lead to 8\u20132. With a six-run lead, Strasburg was removed before the bottom of the seventh, having held the Astros to two runs on seven hits while striking out seven. In the eighth inning, a two-run home run by Adam Eaton plus a run batted in (RBI) by Asdr\u00fabal Cabrera extended the Nationals' lead to nine runs. A ninth-inning home run by Michael A. Taylor off Chris Devenski pushed the lead to 12\u20132. Astro Mart\u00edn Maldonado hit a home run in the bottom of the ninth off relief pitcher Javy Guerra, but there was no further scoring as the Nationals completed their eighth consecutive playoff win.[42]\n\n\n\n### Game 3[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Michael Brantley was 2-for-4 with two RBIs in Game 3.[45]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSean Doolittle, the Nationals' fifth pitcher of the game, got the final out of the eighth inning and retired the side in order in the bottom of the ninth, concluding matters when Carlos Correa lined out to V\u00edctor Robles to preserve the win. Doolittle earned his second save of the postseason and the underdogs took the series lead, marking the first time in franchise history that the Nationals won a World Series game.[36]\n\n\n\n### Game 2[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Stephen Strasburg earned the win in Game 2.[42]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nStrasburg left with one out in the bottom of the ninth, having held the Astros to two runs on five hits while striking out seven.[75] Sean Doolittle relieved Strasburg, and allowed a two-out double to Carlos Correa, but nothing further, and the Nationals evened the series to force a deciding seventh game.[77] This was the first instance in MLB, NBA, or NHL history when the road team won the first six games of a best-of-seven series.[7]\n\n\n\n#### Interference call and Martinez ejection[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nTrea Turner (left) and umpire Sam Holbrook\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBefore the national anthem sung by Nicole Scherzinger, a moment of silence took place in honor of umpire Eric Cooper,[37] who had died on October 20. Former Astro Brian McCann threw out the ceremonial first pitch to former teammate Evan Gattis.[37] Max Scherzer started for the Nationals, while Gerrit Cole started for the Astros. With two outs in the bottom of the first inning,[note 5] Yuli Gurriel hit a two-run double, giving the Astros a 2\u20130 lead. In the top of the second inning,[note 6] Ryan Zimmerman hit a home run to cut the Astros' lead to 2\u20131. Juan Soto led off the top of the fourth inning with a home run to tie the game, 2\u20132. Soto became the fourth-youngest player to hit a home run in a World Series; Andruw Jones in 1996 was the youngest to date.[38] Adam Eaton batted in a run in the top of the fifth inning, followed two batters later by a Soto two-run double, giving the Nationals a 5\u20132 lead.[39]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n*MLB on Fox*\n |\n| --- |\n| Related programs | * *Baseball Night in America* (2012\u2013present)\n* *The Cheap Seats* (2010\u20132011)\n* *Fox Saturday Baseball* (1996\u2013present)\n* *MLB Whiparound*\n* *Major League Baseball Game of the Week*\n* *Thursday Night Baseball* (1997\u20132001, 2019\u2013present)\n* *This Week in Baseball* (2000\u20132011)\n* *Tuesday Night Baseball* (1997\u20131998)\n |\n| Related articles | * DirecTV N3D\n* FoxTrax\n* Scooter\n* Score bug\n* Television contracts\n\t+ 1990s\n\t+ 2000s\n\t+ 2010s\n\t+ 2020s\n* MLB Network\n* World Series television ratings\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nGreinke was charged with two runs on two hits while striking out three in 6+1\u20443 innings.[90] Roberto Osuna pitched the eighth inning for Houston, when Juan Soto batted in Adam Eaton with two outs to give Washington a two-run lead.[91][92] The Nationals extended their lead to 6\u20132 in the ninth inning, with two runs scoring on a one-out single by Eaton with the bases loaded.

The Los Angeles Dodgers, who last won a World Series in 1988 over the Oakland Athletics, made their second consecutive appearance, after losing to the Houston Astros in 2017. The two franchises faced each other in the 1916 World Series; the Red Sox won the series in five games against the then-Brooklyn Robins.[5]\n\n\n\n![](image)A scorebook from the 1916 World Series\nRed Sox manager Alex Cora and Dodgers manager Dave Roberts were teammates on the Dodgers in 2002, 2003, and 2004. Although they did not play together on the Red Sox, both managers played and won a World Series championship with Boston\u2014Roberts in 2004 and Cora in 2007. This was the first World Series with two managers of color;[6] additionally, both managers were born outside the contiguous United States, as Cora was born in Puerto Rico and Roberts in Japan.[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n2018 Major League Baseball postseason\n |\n| --- |\n| **World Series**\n |\n| * American League Championship Series\n* National League Championship Series\n |\n| * American League Division Series\n* National League Division Series\n |\n| * American League Wild Card Game\n* National League Wild Card Game\n |\n| American League teams | * Boston Red Sox\n* Cleveland Indians\n* Houston Astros\n* New York Yankees\n* Oakland Athletics\n |\n| National League teams | * Atlanta Braves\n* Chicago Cubs\n* Colorado Rockies\n* Los Angeles Dodgers\n* Milwaukee Brewers\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Lore | * Curse of the Bambino\n* Cy Young's perfect game\n* Slaughter's Mad Dash\n* 1948 AL tie-breaker game\n* The Impossible Dream\n* Carlton Fisk waves it fair\n* 1978 AL East tie-breaker game\n* Bill Buckner's error\n* \"Idiots\" break the curse\n* MLB Japan Opening Series 2008\n* 2011 Major League Baseball wild card chase\n* Boston Strong\n* 2019 MLB London Series\n |\n| Rivalries | * New York Yankees\n* Tampa Bay Rays\n |\n| Administration | * Owners: Fenway Sports Group\n\t+ John W.

On the field, Boston's top three starters in 2018 \u2014 Chris Sale, David Price, and Nathan Eovaldi \u2014 all missed significant time due to injury in 2019. Overall, the Red Sox would finish 19 games behind the AL East-leading Yankees in 2019.

The game took longer to play than the entire 1939 World Series, which had seven hours and five minutes of total playing time over four games.[52] Until Game 1 of the 2020 World Series, this was the last time a team won a World Series game in their home ballpark.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCorey Seager returned to the Dodgers after being out for most of the 2018 season due to an elbow injury, while Manny Machado, who replaced him after the All-Star break, signed a record free agent contract with the San Diego Padres.[109] The 2019 Dodgers broke the franchise record for wins at 106, but would experience October heartbreak once again by losing to eventual World Champion Washington Nationals in the NLDS in five games.

D. Martinez, and Chris Sale. Betts led baseball in batting average and slugging percentage, while Martinez led in runs batted in. Sale tossed only 158 innings due to a shoulder injury late in the year, but was otherwise superb, posting a 2.11 earned run average to go along with 237 strikeouts.

At the July trade deadline, the team traded for All-Star shortstop Manny Machado from the Orioles to replace injured shortstop Corey Seager and a former All-Star second baseman Brian Dozier from the Twins. In August, the Dodgers acquired former World Series MVP David Freese from the Pirates. For the second year in a row, the Dodgers broke their franchise record for most team home runs in a season.[16] With a 92\u201371 (.564) record, the team entered the playoffs as a second seed and went on to beat the Atlanta Braves in four games in the 2018 National League Division Series and the Milwaukee Brewers in seven games in the 2018 National League Championship Series,[17] becoming the first team in either league to win Game 7 of a League Championship Series on the road since the 2006 Cardinals.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* 2026\n* 2027\n* 2028\n |\n| World Baseball Classic | * 2023\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nWorld Series\n |\n| --- |\n| 1900s | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1903 | ~~1904~~ | 1905 | 1906 | 1907 | 1908 | 1909 |  |  |  |\n | ![](image)\n |\n| 1910s | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1910 | 1911 | 1912 | 1913 | 1914 | 1915 | 1916 | 1917 | 1918 | 1919 |\n |\n| 1920s | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1920 | 1921 | 1922 | 1923 | 1924 | 1925 | 1926 | 1927 | 1928 | 1929 |\n |\n| 1930s | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1930 | 1931 | 1932 | 1933 | 1934 | 1935 | 1936 | 1937 | 1938 | 1939 |\n |\n| 1940s | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1940 | 1941 | 1942 | 1943 | 1944 | 1945 | 1946 | 1947 | 1948 | 1949 |\n |\n| 1950s | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Related articles | * Major League Baseball on the radio\n* Home Run Derby\n* MLB Little League Classic\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n2018 MLB season by team\n |\n| --- |\n| |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| AL East | * Baltimore\n* Boston\n* New York\n* Tampa Bay\n* Toronto\n |\n| AL Central | * Chicago\n* Cleveland\n* Detroit\n* Kansas City\n* Minnesota\n |\n| AL West | * Houston\n* Los Angeles\n* Oakland\n* Seattle\n* Texas\n |\n\n | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| NL East | * Atlanta\n* Miami\n* New York\n* Philadelphia\n* Washington\n |\n| NL Central | * Chicago\n* Cincinnati\n* Milwaukee\n* Pittsburgh\n* St. Louis\n |\n| NL West | * Arizona\n* Colorado\n* Los Angeles\n* San Diego\n* San Francisco\n |\n\n |\n |\n| * 2018 MLB draft\n* 2018 All-Star Game\n* 2018 MLB Little League Classic\n* 2018 World Series\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring the 2018\u20132019 off-season, the Dodgers signed former Red Sox reliever Joe Kelly to a three-year deal.[95] Kelly was marvelous in the World Series against the Dodgers, having struck out ten batters and not allowing a run in five games pitched.

Kershaw became the first pitcher to start the first game of the World Series in back-to-back years since Cliff Lee did so in 2009 (for the Phillies) and 2010 (for the Rangers) and the first to do so for the same team since Dave Stewart pitched three consecutive Game 1s for the Oakland Athletics from 1988 to 1990.[40] The Red Sox struck in the first inning when Mookie Betts singled, stole second and then scored on a hit by Andrew Benintendi, who subsequently scored on a single by J. D. Martinez. Boston benefited from Dodgers' first baseman David Freese missing a foul pop-up by Betts, and right fielder Yasiel Puig allowing Benintendi to advance to second base on a late throw to the plate.[41] A homer by Matt Kemp in the second inning gave the Dodgers a run, and an RBI single by Manny Machado in the third inning tied the score, 2\u20132. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOver the years, 2018 Red Sox and Dodgers would eventually end up playing for the World Series opposition. Along with Kelly, Price, and Betts, Heath Hembree, Craig Kimbrel, J.D. Martinez, and Ryan Braiser joined the Dodgers in the subsequent years afterwards. On the other hand, Enrique Hernandez, Alex Verdugo, Kenley Jansen, and Justin Turner would later play for Boston. According to sportswriter John Tomase at NBC Sports Boston, up to 25% of the Boston Red Sox\u2019s 2023 projected Opening Day roster were players with direct ties to the Dodgers.[110] Incidentally, J.T. Watkins, the Red Sox video coordinator suspended for one year due to his role in the 2018 scandal, was hired by the Dodgers in 2022.[111]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Baseball portal\n* ![photo](image)Los Angeles portal\n\n\n* 2018 Japan Series\n* 2018 Korean Series\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n102. **^** Vanessa, Romo (January 14, 2020). \"Red Sox Manager Alex Cora To 'Part Ways' With Boston After Sign-Stealing Scandal\". *NPR*.

In a game in April 2017, Machado, then with the Baltimore Orioles, aggressively slid over the second base bag and spiked Dustin Pedroia in the knee. Pedroia missed 56 of the remaining 145 games, twice going on the injured list. The Red Sox responded by throwing at Machado throughout the 2017 season, feeling that the slide was a dirty play.[8] Setbacks to his recovery left Pedroia out of the lineup for all but 11 at-bats during the 2018 season. Before the World Series, Pedroia told WEEI\u2019s Rob Bradford about the slide. \u201cI think about it all the time.\u201d And when Bradford asked if there\u2019s been any contact with Machado since then, Pedroia had a terse response, \u201cno.\u201d[9] In the 2018 World Series, Machado was booed heavily at Fenway Park. \n</fragment>\n</document>",
