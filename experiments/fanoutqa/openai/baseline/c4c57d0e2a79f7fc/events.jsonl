The competition is contested by UEFA members' senior men's national teams, determining the continental champion of Europe. It is the second-most watched football tournament in the world after the FIFA World Cup. The Euro 2012 final was watched by a global audience of around 300 million.[2] The competition has been held every four years since 1960, except for 2020, when it was postponed until 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe, but kept the name Euro 2020. Scheduled to be in the even-numbered year between FIFA World Cup tournaments, it was originally called the **European Nations' Cup** before changing to its current name in 1968. Since 1996, the individual events have been branded as \"**UEFA Euro [year]**\".\n\n\nBefore entering the tournament, all teams other than the host nations (which qualify automatically) compete in a qualifying process. Until 2016, the championship winners could compete in the following year's FIFA Confederations Cup, but were not obliged to do so.[3] From the 2020 edition onwards, the winner competes in the CONMEBOL–UEFA Cup of Champions.\n\n\nThe sixteen European Championship tournaments have been won by ten national teams: Germany and Spain have each won three titles, Italy and France have won two titles, and the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, the Netherlands, Denmark, Greece and Portugal have won one title each. To date, Spain is the only team to have won consecutive titles, doing so in 2008 and 2012.\n\n\nThe most recent championship, held across Europe in 2021 (postponed from 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic), was won by Italy, who lifted their second European title after beating England in the final at Wembley Stadium in London on penalties.[4][5]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Beginnings[edit]\n\n\nRegional tournaments for national teams existed before the advent of a truly pan-European competition. Starting in 1883, the British Home Championship was an annual competition contested between the United Kingdom's four national teams, England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland. Until these national teams entered the FIFA World Cup in 1950, it was the most important international tournament these nations competed in. Similarly, from 1927 until 1960, the Central European International Cup was held six times. It brought together the national teams of Austria, Hungary, Italy, Czechoslovakia, Switzerland, and Yugoslavia. The idea for a pan-European football tournament was first proposed by the French Football Federation's secretary-general Henri Delaunay in 1927, but it was not until 1958 that the tournament was started, three years after Delaunay's death.[6] In honour of Delaunay, the trophy awarded to the champions is named after him.[7] The 1960 tournament, held in France, had four teams competing in the finals out of 17 that entered the competition.[8] It was won by the Soviet Union, beating Yugoslavia 2–1 in a tense final in Paris.[9] Spain withdrew from its quarter-final match against the Soviet Union because of two political protests.[10] Of the 17 teams that entered the qualifying tournament, notable absentees were England, the Netherlands, West Germany and Italy.[11]\n\n\nSpain held the next tournament in 1964, which saw an increase in entries to the qualification tournament, with 29 entering;[12] West Germany was a notable absentee once again and Greece withdrew after being drawn against Albania, with whom they were still at war.[13] The hosts beat the title holders, the Soviet Union, 2–1 at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in Madrid.[14]\n\n\nThe tournament format stayed the same for the 1968 tournament, hosted and won by Italy.[15][16] For the first and only time, a match was decided on a coin toss (the semi-final between Italy and the Soviet Union)[17] and the final went to a replay, after the match against Yugoslavia finished 1–1.[18] Italy won the replay 2–0.[19] More teams entered this tournament (31), a testament to its burgeoning popularity.[20]\n\n\nBelgium hosted the 1972 tournament, which West Germany won, beating the Soviet Union 3–0 in the final, with goals coming from Gerd Müller (twice) and Herbert Wimmer at the Heysel Stadium in Brussels.[21] This tournament would provide a taste of things to come, as the German side contained many of the key members of the 1974 FIFA World Cup Champions.[22][23]\n\n\nThe 1976 tournament in Yugoslavia was the last in which only four teams took part in the final tournament, and the last in which the hosts had to qualify. Czechoslovakia beat West Germany in the newly introduced penalty shootout. After seven successful conversions, Uli Hoeneß missed, leaving Czechoslovakian Antonín Panenka with the opportunity to score and win the tournament. An \"audacious\" chipped shot,[24] described by UEFA as \"perhaps the most famous spot kick of all time\" secured the victory as Czechoslovakia won 5–3 on penalties.[25]\n\n\n\n### Expansion to 8 teams[edit]\n\n\nThe competition was expanded to eight teams in the 1980 tournament, again hosted by Italy. It involved a group stage, with the winners of the groups going on to contest the final, and the runners-up playing in the third place play-off.[26] West Germany won their second European title by beating Belgium 2–1, with two goals scored by Horst Hrubesch at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome.[27] Horst Hrubesch scored early in the first half before René Vandereycken equalised for Belgium with a penalty in the second half. With two minutes remaining, Hrubesch headed the winner for West Germany from a Karl-Heinz Rummenigge corner.[28]\n\n\nFrance won their first major title at home in the 1984 tournament, with their captain Michel Platini scoring 9 goals in just 5 games, including the opening goal in the final, in which they beat Spain 2–0.[29][30] The format also changed, with the top two teams in each group going through to a semi-final stage, instead of the winners of each group going straight into the final. The third place play-off was also abolished.[31]\n\n\n\n![](image)Ruud Gullit and the Netherlands team celebrating their victory in 1988\nWest Germany hosted UEFA Euro 1988, but lost 2–1 to the Netherlands, their traditional rivals, in the semi-finals, which sparked vigorous celebrations in the Netherlands.[32][33] The Netherlands went on to win the tournament in a rematch of their first game of the group stage, beating the Soviet Union 2–0 at the Olympia Stadion in Munich.[34] Marco van Basten scored the second goal, a volley over the keeper from the right wing which is often considered one of the best goals ever scored.[35]\n\n\nUEFA Euro 1992 was held in Sweden, and was won by Denmark, who were only in the finals after UN sanctions prevented Yugoslavia's participation as some of the states constituting the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia were at war with each other.[36][37] The Danes beat holders the Netherlands on penalties in the semi-finals,[38] then defeated world champion Germany 2–0.[39] This was the first tournament in which a unified Germany took part and also the first major tournament to have the players' names printed on their backs.\n\n\n\n### Expansion to 16 teams[edit]\n\n\nEngland hosted UEFA Euro 1996, the first tournament to use the nomenclature \"Euro [year]\" and would see the number of teams taking part double to 16.[40] The hosts, in a replay of the 1990 FIFA World Cup semi-final, were knocked out on penalties by Germany.[41] The surprise team of the tournament was the newly formed Czech Republic, participating on its first international competition following the dissolution of Czechoslovakia, which reached the final after beating Portugal and France in the knockout stage. Germany would go on to win the Final 2–1 thanks to the first golden goal ever in a major tournament, scored by Oliver Bierhoff five minutes into extra time.[42][43] This was Germany's first title as a unified nation.\n\n\nUEFA Euro 2000 was the first tournament to be held by two countries, in the Netherlands and Belgium.[44] France, the reigning World Cup champions, were favoured to win, and they lived up to expectations when they beat Italy 2–1 after extra time, having come from being 1–0 down: Sylvain Wiltord equalised in the last minute of regular time and David Trezeguet scored the winning golden goal in extra time.[45]\n\n\n\n![](image)The UEFA Euro 2004 opening ceremony in Portugal.\nUEFA Euro 2004, like 1992, produced an upset: Greece, who had only qualified for one World Cup (1994) and one European Championship (1980) before, beat hosts Portugal 1–0 in the final (after having also beaten them in the opening game) with a goal scored by Angelos Charisteas in the 57th minute to win a tournament that they had been given odds of 150–1 to win before it began[46] (being the second least likely team to have any success after Latvia)[*citation needed*]. On their way to the Final, they also beat holders France[47] as well as the Czech Republic with a silver goal,[48][49] a rule which replaced the previous golden goal in 2003, before being abolished itself shortly after this tournament.\n\n\nThe 2008 tournament, hosted by Austria and Switzerland, marked the second time that two nations co-hosted and the first edition where the new trophy was awarded.[50] It commenced on 7 June and finished on 29 June.[51] The Final between Germany and Spain was held at the Ernst Happel Stadion in Vienna.[52] Spain defeated Germany 1–0, with a goal scored by Fernando Torres in the 33rd minute, sparking much celebration across the country.[53] This was their first title since the 1964 tournament. Spain were the highest scoring team with 12 goals scored and David Villa finished as the top scorer with four goals. Xavi was awarded the player of the tournament, and nine Spanish players were picked for the team of the tournament.\n\n\nThe UEFA Euro 2012 tournament was co-hosted by Poland and Ukraine.[54] Spain defeated Italy 4–0 in the Final, thus becoming the first nation to defend a European Championship title, as well as the first European team to win three consecutive major tournaments.[55] In scoring the third goal of the final, Torres became the first player to score in two European Championship finals. He was equal top scorer for the tournament with three goals in total, along with Mario Balotelli, Alan Dzagoev, Mario Gómez, Mario Mandžukić, and Cristiano Ronaldo, despite only being used as a substitute player. The tournament was otherwise notable for having the most headed goals in a Euro tournament (26 out of 76 goals in total); a disallowed goal in the England versus Ukraine group game which replays showed had crossed the goal line, and which prompted President of FIFA Sepp Blatter to tweet, \"GLT (Goal-line technology) is no longer an alternative but a necessity\",[56] thus reversing his long-held reluctance to embrace such technology; and some crowd violence in group games.\n\n\n\n### Expansion to 24 teams[edit]\n\n\nIn 2007, the Football Association of Ireland and Scottish Football Association proposed the expansion of the tournament, which was later confirmed by the UEFA Executive Committee in September 2008.[57][58] Out of the 54 member associations of UEFA, only three, including England and Germany, opposed the expansion.[59] On 28 May 2010, UEFA announced that UEFA Euro 2016 would be hosted by France. France beat bids of Turkey (7–6 in voting in the second voting round) and Italy, which had the fewest votes in the first voting round.[60] Euro 2016 was the first to have 24 teams in the finals.[61] This was the third time France have hosted the competition. Portugal, which qualified for the knock-out phase despite finishing third in its group, went on to win the championship by defeating heavily favoured host team France 1–0 in the Final, thanks to a goal from Eder in the 109th minute. Cristiano Ronaldo, Portugal's world-renowned striker, came out of the game due to injury in the 25th minute. This was the first time Portugal won a major tournament.\n\n\nFor the 2020 tournament, three bids were proposed, including a bid from Turkey,[62] a joint bid from the Republic of Ireland, Scotland and Wales,[63] and a joint bid from Georgia and Azerbaijan.[64] In December 2012, however, UEFA announced that the 2020 tournament would be hosted in several cities in various countries across Europe, with the semi-finals and Final being played in London.[65][66] The venues were selected and announced by UEFA on 19 September 2014.[67] However, Brussels was removed as a host city on 7 December 2017 due to delays with the building of the Eurostadium.[68] On 17 March 2020, UEFA announced that Euro 2020 would be delayed by a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe, and proposed it take place from 11 June to 11 July 2021. The competition was postponed in order to reduce pressure on the public services in affected countries and to provide space in the calendar for the completion of domestic leagues that had been suspended.[69] Before the Euro 2020, Dublin was also removed as one of the host cities due to its inability to guarantee spectators to the stadium, while Bilbao was replaced by Seville for the same reason.[70][71] In the Final, Italy defeated maiden finalists England 3–2 on penalties, after the game was tied 1–1 after extra time, to win their second European Championship.[72]\n\n\n\n## Trophy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The trophy on display in 2021\nThe Henri Delaunay Trophy, which is awarded to the winner of the European Championship, is named in honour of Henri Delaunay, the first General Secretary of UEFA, who came up with the idea of a European championship but died five years before the first tournament in 1960. His son Pierre was in charge of creating the trophy.[73] Since the first tournament it has been awarded to the winning team for them to keep for four years, until the next tournament. This trophy bore the words *Coupe d'Europe* (\"European Cup\"), *Coupe Henri Delaunay* (\"Henri Delaunay Cup\"), and *Championnat d'Europe* (\"European Championship\") on the front and a juggling boy on the back.\n\n\nFor the 2008 tournament, the Henri Delaunay Trophy was remodelled to make it larger, as the old trophy was overshadowed by UEFA's other trophies such as the new European Champion Clubs' Cup. The new trophy, which is made of sterling silver, now weighs 8 kilograms (18 lb) and is 60 centimetres (24 in) tall, being 2 kilograms (4.4 lb) heavier and 18 centimetres (7.1 in) longer than the old one. The marble plinth that was serving as base was removed. The new silver base of the trophy had to be enlarged to make it stable. The names of the winning countries that had appeared on the plaques glued to the plinth are now engraved on the back of the trophy,[74] under the word *Coupe Henri Delaunay* and are written in English rather than French its predecessor had. The 1972 and 1980 winning country, West Germany, is written as just *Germany*.[*citation needed*] Since 2016, the juggling boy was returned on the trophy's back.\n\n\nThe players and coaches of the winning team and the runner-up team are awarded gold and silver medals, respectively. Each association that competes in the final tournament receives a commemorative plaque. Each time the team losing semi-finalist, as well as each finalist, receive a dedicated plaque. Though there is no longer a third place play-off, UEFA decided in the 2008 edition to award the semi-final losers (Turkey and Russia) bronze medals for the first time,[75] and did the same in the 2012 edition when Germany and Portugal received bronze medals.[76] However, UEFA decided that losing semi-finalists would no longer receive medals from the 2016 edition onwards.[77] Bronze medals were previously awarded for winners of the third place play-off, the last of which was held in 1980.\n\n\n\n## Format[edit]\n\n\n### The competition[edit]\n\n\nBefore 1980, only four teams qualified for the final tournament. From 1980, eight teams competed. In 1996 the tournament expanded to 16 teams, since it was easier for European nations to qualify for the World Cup than their own continental championship; 14 of the 24 teams at the 1982, 1986 and 1990 World Cups had been European, whereas the European Championship finals still involved only eight teams.\n\n\nIn 2007, there was much discussion about an expansion of the tournament to 24 teams, started by Scotland and the Republic of Ireland, due to the increased number of football associations in Europe after the break-ups of Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union, and the inclusion of Israel and Kazakhstan. The new president of UEFA, Michel Platini, was reported to be in favour of expansion which proved an accurate assumption. Whilst on 17 April 2007, UEFA's executive committee formally decided against expansion in 2012, Platini indicated in June 2008 that UEFA will increase participation from 16 to 24 teams in future tournaments, starting from 2016.[78] On 25 September, it was announced by Franz Beckenbauer that an agreement had been reached, and the expansion to 24 teams would be officially announced the next day.[79]\n\n\nThe competing teams are chosen by a series of qualifying games: in 1960 and 1964 through home and away play-offs; from 1968 through a combination of both qualifying groups and play-off games. The host country was selected from the four finalists after they were determined through qualifying.\n\n\nSince the expansion of the final tournament starting from 1980, the host country, or countries, have been chosen beforehand and qualify automatically.\n\n\nIn most tournaments, the tournament consists of a round-robin group stage followed by a single-elimination knockout stage.\n\n\n\n\n\n| No.\n | Year\n | Host\n | Teams\n | Matches\n | Round 1\n | Final stages\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | 1960 | ![](image) France | 4\n | 4\n | knockout: 4 matches (not counting replays)\n |\n| 2\n | 1964 | ![](image) Spain |\n| 3\n | 1968 | ![](image) Italy | 5\n |\n| 4\n | 1972 | ![](image) Belgium | 4\n | knockout: 4 matches\n |\n| 5\n | 1976 | ![](image) Yugoslavia |\n| 6\n | 1980 | ![](image) Italy | 8\n | 14\n | 2 groups of 4 teams: 12 matches\n | final (round 1 group winners) and third-place match (round 1 group runners-up)\n |\n| 7\n | 1984 | ![](image) France | 15\n | knockout of 4 teams (round 1 group winners and runners-up): 3 matches\n |\n| 8\n | 1988 | ![](image) West Germany |\n| 9\n | 1992 | ![](image) Sweden |\n| 10\n | 1996 | ![](image) England | 16\n | 31\n | 4 groups of 4 teams: 24 matches\n | knockout of 8 teams (round 1 group winners and runners-up): 7 matches\n |\n| 11\n | 2000 | ![](image) Belgium![](image) Netherlands |\n| 12\n | 2004 | ![](image) Portugal |\n| 13\n | 2008 | ![](image) Austria![](image)  Switzerland |\n| 14\n | 2012 | ![](image) Poland![](image) Ukraine |\n| 15\n | 2016 | ![](image) France | 24\n | 51\n | 6 groups of 4 teams: 36 matches\n | knockout of 16 teams (round 1 group winners and runners-up, plus four best third-placed teams): 15 matches\n |\n| 16\n | 2020[s 1] | ![](image) Europe[s 2] |\n| *17* | *2024* | *![](image) Germany* |\n| *18* | *2028* | *![](image) England![](image) Northern Ireland![](image) Republic of Ireland![](image) Scotland![](image) Wales* |\n| *19* | *2032* | *![](image) Italy![](image) Turkey* |\n\n\n1. **^** Postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe\n2. **^** Pan–European edition hosted by eleven countries: Azerbaijan, Denmark, England, Germany, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Romania, Russia, Scotland and Spain\n\nUp to 1968 draws were to be broken via a coin toss in all matches but the final, draw in final match was resolved via a replay.\n\n\nNo third place play-off has been played since 1980.\n\n\n\n### Qualifying[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA European Championship qualifying\n\nTo qualify, a team must finish in one of the qualifying spots or win a play-off. After this, a team proceeds to the finals round in the host country, although hosts qualify for the tournament automatically. The qualifying phase begins in the autumn after the preceding FIFA World Cup, almost two years before the finals.\n\n\nThe groups for qualification are drawn by a UEFA committee using seeding. Seeded teams include reigning champions and other teams based on their performance in the preceding FIFA World Cup qualifying and the last European Championship qualifying. To obtain an accurate view of the teams' abilities, a ranking is produced. This is calculated by taking the total number of points won by a particular team and dividing it by the number of games played, i.e. points per game. In the case of a team having hosted one of the two previous competitions and therefore having qualified automatically, only the results from the single most recent qualifying competition are used. If two teams have equal points per game, the committee then bases their positions in the rankings on:\n\n\n\n1. Coefficient from the matches played in its most recent qualifying competition.\n2. Average goal difference.\n3. Average number of goals scored.\n4. Average number of away goals scored.\n5. Drawing of lots.\n\n\nThe qualifying phase is played in a group format, the composition of the groups is determined through means of a draw of teams from pre-defined seeded bowls. The draw takes place after the preceding World Cup's qualifying competition. For UEFA Euro 2020, the group qualifying phase consisted of ten groups; five of six teams and the remainder of five teams each.\n\n\nEach group is played in a league format with teams playing each other home and away. The top two teams then qualified for the final tournament, with remaining places decided by playoffs depending on their ranking in the UEFA Nations League. As with most leagues, the points are awarded as three for a win, one for a draw, and none for a loss. In the eventuality of one or more teams having equal points after all matches have been played, the following criteria are used to distinguish the sides:\n\n\n\n1. Higher number of points obtained in the group matches played among the teams in question.\n2. Superior goal difference from the group matches played among the teams in question.\n3. Higher number of goals scored in the group matches played among the teams in question.\n4. Higher number of goals scored away from home in the group matches played among the teams in question.\n5. Results of all group matches:\n\t1. Superior goal difference\n\t2. Higher number of goals scored\n\t3. Higher number of goals scored away from home\n\t4. Fair play conduct.\n6. Drawing of lots.\n\n\n### Final tournament[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Map of countries' best results. 10 countries have won, counting Germany and West Germany as one\nSixteen teams progressed to the final tournament for the 2012 tournament. They were joint hosts Poland and Ukraine, the winners and the highest ranked second-placed team from the nine qualifying groups as well as the winners of four play-off matches between the runners-up of the other groups. These sixteen teams were divided equally into four groups, A, B, C and D, each consisting of four teams. The groups were drawn up by the UEFA administration, again using seeding. The seeded teams being the host nations, the reigning champions, should they qualify, and those with the best points per game coefficients over the qualifying phase of the tournament and the previous World Cup qualifying. Other finalists were assigned to by means of a draw, using coefficients as a basis.\n\n\nFor the 2016 tournament, the expansion to 24 teams means that the teams will be drawn into six groups of four, with the six group winners, six group runners-up and the four best third-placed teams advancing to the round of 16 when it becomes a knockout competition.[77]\n\n\nThe groups are again played in a league format, where a team plays its opponents once each. The same points system is used (three points for a win, one point for a draw, no points for a defeat). A schedule for the group matches will be drawn up, but the last two matches in a group must kick off simultaneously. The winner and runner-up of each group progress to the next round, where a knockout system is used (the two teams play each other once, the winner progresses), this is used in all subsequent rounds as well. The winners of the quarter-finals matches progress to the semi-finals, where the winners play in the final. If in any of the knockout rounds, the scores are still equal after normal playing time, extra time and penalties are employed to separate the two teams. Unlike the FIFA World Cup, this tournament no longer has a third place playoff.\n\n\n\n## Results[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of UEFA European Championship finals\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Year\n | Host\n |  | Final\n |  | Third place playoff\n |  | Number of teams\n |\n| Winners\n | Score and venue\n | Runners-up\n | Third place\n | Score and venue\n | Fourth place\n |\n| 1960 | ![](image) France | **![](image)Soviet Union** | **2–1** (a.e.t.)Parc des Princes, Paris | ![](image)Yugoslavia | ![](image)Czechoslovakia | 2–0 Stade Vélodrome, Marseille | ![](image)France | 4\n |\n| 1964 | ![](image) Spain | **![](image)Spain** | **2–1**Santiago Bernabéu, Madrid | ![](image)Soviet Union | ![](image)Hungary | 3–1 (a.e.t.)Camp Nou, Barcelona | ![](image)Denmark | 4\n |\n| 1968 | ![](image) Italy | **![](image)Italy** | **1–1** (a.e.t.)**2–0** (replay)Stadio Olimpico, Rome | ![](image)Yugoslavia | ![](image)England | 2–0 Stadio Olimpico, Rome | ![](image)Soviet Union | 4\n |\n| 1972 | ![](image) Belgium | **![](image)West Germany** | **3–0**Heysel Stadium, Brussels | ![](image)Soviet Union | ![](image)Belgium | 2–1Stade Maurice Dufrasne, Liège | ![](image)Hungary | 4\n |\n| 1976 | ![](image) Yugoslavia | **![](image)Czechoslovakia** | **2–2** (a.e.t.)(5–3 p)Red Star Stadium, Belgrade | ![](image)West Germany | ![](image)Netherlands | 3–2 (a.e.t.)Stadion Maksimir, Zagreb | ![](image)Yugoslavia | 4\n |\n| 1980 | ![](image) Italy | **![](image)West Germany** | **2–1**Stadio Olimpico, Rome | ![](image)Belgium | ![](image)Czechoslovakia | 1–1 [a](9–8 p)Stadio San Paolo, Naples | ![](image)Italy | 8\n |\n| Losing semi-finalists[b] |\n| 1984 | ![](image) France | **![](image)France** | **2–0**Parc des Princes, Paris | ![](image)Spain | ![](image) Denmark and ![](image) Portugal | 8\n |\n| 1988 | ![](image) West Germany | **![](image)Netherlands** | **2–0**Olympiastadion, Munich | ![](image)Soviet Union | ![](image) Italy and ![](image) West Germany | 8\n |\n| 1992 | ![](image) Sweden | **![](image)Denmark** | **2–0**Ullevi, Gothenburg | ![](image)Germany | ![](image) Netherlands and ![](image) Sweden | 8\n |\n| 1996 | ![](image) England | **![](image)Germany** | **2–1** (g.g.)Wembley Stadium, London | ![](image)Czech Republic | ![](image) England and ![](image) France | 16\n |\n| 2000 | ![](image) Belgium![](image) Netherlands | **![](image)France** | **2–1** (g.g.)De Kuip, Rotterdam | ![](image)Italy | ![](image) Netherlands and ![](image) Portugal | 16\n |\n| 2004 | ![](image) Portugal | **![](image)Greece** | **1–0**Estádio da Luz, Lisbon | ![](image)Portugal | ![](image) Czech Republic and ![](image) Netherlands | 16\n |\n| 2008 | ![](image) Austria![](image)  Switzerland | **![](image)Spain** | **1–0**Ernst-Happel-Stadion, Vienna | ![](image)Germany | ![](image) Russia and ![](image) Turkey | 16\n |\n| 2012 | ![](image) Poland![](image) Ukraine | **![](image)Spain** | **4–0**Olimpiyskiy, Kyiv | ![](image)Italy | ![](image) Germany and ![](image) Portugal | 16\n |\n| 2016 | ![](image) France | **![](image)Portugal** | **1–0** (a.e.t.)

The competition is contested by UEFA members' senior men's national teams, determining the continental champion of Europe. It is the second-most watched football tournament in the world after the FIFA World Cup. The Euro 2012 final was watched by a global audience of around 300 million.[2] The competition has been held every four years since 1960, except for 2020, when it was postponed until 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe, but kept the name Euro 2020. Scheduled to be in the even-numbered year between FIFA World Cup tournaments, it was originally called the **European Nations' Cup** before changing to its current name in 1968. Since 1996, the individual events have been branded as \"**UEFA Euro [year]**\".\n\n\nBefore entering the tournament, all teams other than the host nations (which qualify automatically) compete in a qualifying process. Until 2016, the championship winners could compete in the following year's FIFA Confederations Cup, but were not obliged to do so.[3] From the 2020 edition onwards, the winner competes in the CONMEBOL–UEFA Cup of Champions.\n\n\nThe sixteen European Championship tournaments have been won by ten national teams: Germany and Spain have each won three titles, Italy and France have won two titles, and the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, the Netherlands, Denmark, Greece and Portugal have won one title each. To date, Spain is the only team to have won consecutive titles, doing so in 2008 and 2012.\n\n\nThe most recent championship, held across Europe in 2021 (postponed from 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic), was won by Italy, who lifted their second European title after beating England in the final at Wembley Stadium in London on penalties.[4][5]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Beginnings[edit]\n\n\nRegional tournaments for national teams existed before the advent of a truly pan-European competition. Starting in 1883, the British Home Championship was an annual competition contested between the United Kingdom's four national teams, England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland. Until these national teams entered the FIFA World Cup in 1950, it was the most important international tournament these nations competed in. Similarly, from 1927 until 1960, the Central European International Cup was held six times. It brought together the national teams of Austria, Hungary, Italy, Czechoslovakia, Switzerland, and Yugoslavia. The idea for a pan-European football tournament was first proposed by the French Football Federation's secretary-general Henri Delaunay in 1927, but it was not until 1958 that the tournament was started, three years after Delaunay's death.[6] In honour of Delaunay, the trophy awarded to the champions is named after him.[7] The 1960 tournament, held in France, had four teams competing in the finals out of 17 that entered the competition.[8] It was won by the Soviet Union, beating Yugoslavia 2–1 in a tense final in Paris.[9] Spain withdrew from its quarter-final match against the Soviet Union because of two political protests.[10] Of the 17 teams that entered the qualifying tournament, notable absentees were England, the Netherlands, West Germany and Italy.[11]\n\n\nSpain held the next tournament in 1964, which saw an increase in entries to the qualification tournament, with 29 entering;[12] West Germany was a notable absentee once again and Greece withdrew after being drawn against Albania, with whom they were still at war.[13] The hosts beat the title holders, the Soviet Union, 2–1 at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in Madrid.[14]\n\n\nThe tournament format stayed the same for the 1968 tournament, hosted and won by Italy.[15][16] For the first and only time, a match was decided on a coin toss (the semi-final between Italy and the Soviet Union)[17] and the final went to a replay, after the match against Yugoslavia finished 1–1.[18] Italy won the replay 2–0.[19] More teams entered this tournament (31), a testament to its burgeoning popularity.[20]\n\n\nBelgium hosted the 1972 tournament, which West Germany won, beating the Soviet Union 3–0 in the final, with goals coming from Gerd Müller (twice) and Herbert Wimmer at the Heysel Stadium in Brussels.[21] This tournament would provide a taste of things to come, as the German side contained many of the key members of the 1974 FIFA World Cup Champions.[22][23]\n\n\nThe 1976 tournament in Yugoslavia was the last in which only four teams took part in the final tournament, and the last in which the hosts had to qualify. Czechoslovakia beat West Germany in the newly introduced penalty shootout. After seven successful conversions, Uli Hoeneß missed, leaving Czechoslovakian Antonín Panenka with the opportunity to score and win the tournament. An \"audacious\" chipped shot,[24] described by UEFA as \"perhaps the most famous spot kick of all time\" secured the victory as Czechoslovakia won 5–3 on penalties.[25]\n\n\n\n### Expansion to 8 teams[edit]\n\n\nThe competition was expanded to eight teams in the 1980 tournament, again hosted by Italy. It involved a group stage, with the winners of the groups going on to contest the final, and the runners-up playing in the third place play-off.[26] West Germany won their second European title by beating Belgium 2–1, with two goals scored by Horst Hrubesch at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome.[27] Horst Hrubesch scored early in the first half before René Vandereycken equalised for Belgium with a penalty in the second half. With two minutes remaining, Hrubesch headed the winner for West Germany from a Karl-Heinz Rummenigge corner.[28]\n\n\nFrance won their first major title at home in the 1984 tournament, with their captain Michel Platini scoring 9 goals in just 5 games, including the opening goal in the final, in which they beat Spain 2–0.[29][30] The format also changed, with the top two teams in each group going through to a semi-final stage, instead of the winners of each group going straight into the final. The third place play-off was also abolished.[31]\n\n\n\n![](image)Ruud Gullit and the Netherlands team celebrating their victory in 1988\nWest Germany hosted UEFA Euro 1988, but lost 2–1 to the Netherlands, their traditional rivals, in the semi-finals, which sparked vigorous celebrations in the Netherlands.[32][33] The Netherlands went on to win the tournament in a rematch of their first game of the group stage, beating the Soviet Union 2–0 at the Olympia Stadion in Munich.[34] Marco van Basten scored the second goal, a volley over the keeper from the right wing which is often considered one of the best goals ever scored.[35]\n\n\nUEFA Euro 1992 was held in Sweden, and was won by Denmark, who were only in the finals after UN sanctions prevented Yugoslavia's participation as some of the states constituting the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia were at war with each other.[36][37] The Danes beat holders the Netherlands on penalties in the semi-finals,[38] then defeated world champion Germany 2–0.[39] This was the first tournament in which a unified Germany took part and also the first major tournament to have the players' names printed on their backs.\n\n\n\n### Expansion to 16 teams[edit]\n\n\nEngland hosted UEFA Euro 1996, the first tournament to use the nomenclature \"Euro [year]\" and would see the number of teams taking part double to 16.[40] The hosts, in a replay of the 1990 FIFA World Cup semi-final, were knocked out on penalties by Germany.[41] The surprise team of the tournament was the newly formed Czech Republic, participating on its first international competition following the dissolution of Czechoslovakia, which reached the final after beating Portugal and France in the knockout stage. Germany would go on to win the Final 2–1 thanks to the first golden goal ever in a major tournament, scored by Oliver Bierhoff five minutes into extra time.[42][43] This was Germany's first title as a unified nation.\n\n\nUEFA Euro 2000 was the first tournament to be held by two countries, in the Netherlands and Belgium.[44] France, the reigning World Cup champions, were favoured to win, and they lived up to expectations when they beat Italy 2–1 after extra time, having come from being 1–0 down: Sylvain Wiltord equalised in the last minute of regular time and David Trezeguet scored the winning golden goal in extra time.[45]\n\n\n\n![](image)The UEFA Euro 2004 opening ceremony in Portugal.\nUEFA Euro 2004, like 1992, produced an upset: Greece, who had only qualified for one World Cup (1994) and one European Championship (1980) before, beat hosts Portugal 1–0 in the final (after having also beaten them in the opening game) with a goal scored by Angelos Charisteas in the 57th minute to win a tournament that they had been given odds of 150–1 to win before it began[46] (being the second least likely team to have any success after Latvia)[*citation needed*]. On their way to the Final, they also beat holders France[47] as well as the Czech Republic with a silver goal,[48][49] a rule which replaced the previous golden goal in 2003, before being abolished itself shortly after this tournament.\n\n\nThe 2008 tournament, hosted by Austria and Switzerland, marked the second time that two nations co-hosted and the first edition where the new trophy was awarded.[50] It commenced on 7 June and finished on 29 June.[51] The Final between Germany and Spain was held at the Ernst Happel Stadion in Vienna.[52] Spain defeated Germany 1–0, with a goal scored by Fernando Torres in the 33rd minute, sparking much celebration across the country.[53] This was their first title since the 1964 tournament. Spain were the highest scoring team with 12 goals scored and David Villa finished as the top scorer with four goals. Xavi was awarded the player of the tournament, and nine Spanish players were picked for the team of the tournament.\n\n\nThe UEFA Euro 2012 tournament was co-hosted by Poland and Ukraine.[54] Spain defeated Italy 4–0 in the Final, thus becoming the first nation to defend a European Championship title, as well as the first European team to win three consecutive major tournaments.[55] In scoring the third goal of the final, Torres became the first player to score in two European Championship finals. He was equal top scorer for the tournament with three goals in total, along with Mario Balotelli, Alan Dzagoev, Mario Gómez, Mario Mandžukić, and Cristiano Ronaldo, despite only being used as a substitute player. The tournament was otherwise notable for having the most headed goals in a Euro tournament (26 out of 76 goals in total); a disallowed goal in the England versus Ukraine group game which replays showed had crossed the goal line, and which prompted President of FIFA Sepp Blatter to tweet, \"GLT (Goal-line technology) is no longer an alternative but a necessity\",[56] thus reversing his long-held reluctance to embrace such technology; and some crowd violence in group games.\n\n\n\n### Expansion to 24 teams[edit]\n\n\nIn 2007, the Football Association of Ireland and Scottish Football Association proposed the expansion of the tournament, which was later confirmed by the UEFA Executive Committee in September 2008.[57][58] Out of the 54 member associations of UEFA, only three, including England and Germany, opposed the expansion.[59] On 28 May 2010, UEFA announced that UEFA Euro 2016 would be hosted by France. France beat bids of Turkey (7–6 in voting in the second voting round) and Italy, which had the fewest votes in the first voting round.[60] Euro 2016 was the first to have 24 teams in the finals.[61] This was the third time France have hosted the competition. Portugal, which qualified for the knock-out phase despite finishing third in its group, went on to win the championship by defeating heavily favoured host team France 1–0 in the Final, thanks to a goal from Eder in the 109th minute. Cristiano Ronaldo, Portugal's world-renowned striker, came out of the game due to injury in the 25th minute. This was the first time Portugal won a major tournament.\n\n\nFor the 2020 tournament, three bids were proposed, including a bid from Turkey,[62] a joint bid from the Republic of Ireland, Scotland and Wales,[63] and a joint bid from Georgia and Azerbaijan.[64] In December 2012, however, UEFA announced that the 2020 tournament would be hosted in several cities in various countries across Europe, with the semi-finals and Final being played in London.[65][66] The venues were selected and announced by UEFA on 19 September 2014.[67] However, Brussels was removed as a host city on 7 December 2017 due to delays with the building of the Eurostadium.[68] On 17 March 2020, UEFA announced that Euro 2020 would be delayed by a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe, and proposed it take place from 11 June to 11 July 2021. The competition was postponed in order to reduce pressure on the public services in affected countries and to provide space in the calendar for the completion of domestic leagues that had been suspended.[69] Before the Euro 2020, Dublin was also removed as one of the host cities due to its inability to guarantee spectators to the stadium, while Bilbao was replaced by Seville for the same reason.[70][71] In the Final, Italy defeated maiden finalists England 3–2 on penalties, after the game was tied 1–1 after extra time, to win their second European Championship.[72]\n\n\n\n## Trophy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The trophy on display in 2021\nThe Henri Delaunay Trophy, which is awarded to the winner of the European Championship, is named in honour of Henri Delaunay, the first General Secretary of UEFA, who came up with the idea of a European championship but died five years before the first tournament in 1960. His son Pierre was in charge of creating the trophy.[73] Since the first tournament it has been awarded to the winning team for them to keep for four years, until the next tournament. This trophy bore the words *Coupe d'Europe* (\"European Cup\"), *Coupe Henri Delaunay* (\"Henri Delaunay Cup\"), and *Championnat d'Europe* (\"European Championship\") on the front and a juggling boy on the back.\n\n\nFor the 2008 tournament, the Henri Delaunay Trophy was remodelled to make it larger, as the old trophy was overshadowed by UEFA's other trophies such as the new European Champion Clubs' Cup. The new trophy, which is made of sterling silver, now weighs 8 kilograms (18 lb) and is 60 centimetres (24 in) tall, being 2 kilograms (4.4 lb) heavier and 18 centimetres (7.1 in) longer than the old one. The marble plinth that was serving as base was removed. The new silver base of the trophy had to be enlarged to make it stable. The names of the winning countries that had appeared on the plaques glued to the plinth are now engraved on the back of the trophy,[74] under the word *Coupe Henri Delaunay* and are written in English rather than French its predecessor had. The 1972 and 1980 winning country, West Germany, is written as just *Germany*.[*citation needed*] Since 2016, the juggling boy was returned on the trophy's back.\n\n\nThe players and coaches of the winning team and the runner-up team are awarded gold and silver medals, respectively. Each association that competes in the final tournament receives a commemorative plaque. Each time the team losing semi-finalist, as well as each finalist, receive a dedicated plaque. Though there is no longer a third place play-off, UEFA decided in the 2008 edition to award the semi-final losers (Turkey and Russia) bronze medals for the first time,[75] and did the same in the 2012 edition when Germany and Portugal received bronze medals.[76] However, UEFA decided that losing semi-finalists would no longer receive medals from the 2016 edition onwards.[77] Bronze medals were previously awarded for winners of the third place play-off, the last of which was held in 1980.\n\n\n\n## Format[edit]\n\n\n### The competition[edit]\n\n\nBefore 1980, only four teams qualified for the final tournament. From 1980, eight teams competed. In 1996 the tournament expanded to 16 teams, since it was easier for European nations to qualify for the World Cup than their own continental championship; 14 of the 24 teams at the 1982, 1986 and 1990 World Cups had been European, whereas the European Championship finals still involved only eight teams.\n\n\nIn 2007, there was much discussion about an expansion of the tournament to 24 teams, started by Scotland and the Republic of Ireland, due to the increased number of football associations in Europe after the break-ups of Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union, and the inclusion of Israel and Kazakhstan. The new president of UEFA, Michel Platini, was reported to be in favour of expansion which proved an accurate assumption. Whilst on 17 April 2007, UEFA's executive committee formally decided against expansion in 2012, Platini indicated in June 2008 that UEFA will increase participation from 16 to 24 teams in future tournaments, starting from 2016.[78] On 25 September, it was announced by Franz Beckenbauer that an agreement had been reached, and the expansion to 24 teams would be officially announced the next day.[79]\n\n\nThe competing teams are chosen by a series of qualifying games: in 1960 and 1964 through home and away play-offs; from 1968 through a combination of both qualifying groups and play-off games. The host country was selected from the four finalists after they were determined through qualifying.\n\n\nSince the expansion of the final tournament starting from 1980, the host country, or countries, have been chosen beforehand and qualify automatically.\n\n\nIn most tournaments, the tournament consists of a round-robin group stage followed by a single-elimination knockout stage.\n\n\n\n\n\n| No.\n | Year\n | Host\n | Teams\n | Matches\n | Round 1\n | Final stages\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | 1960 | ![](image) France | 4\n | 4\n | knockout: 4 matches (not counting replays)\n |\n| 2\n | 1964 | ![](image) Spain |\n| 3\n | 1968 | ![](image) Italy | 5\n |\n| 4\n | 1972 | ![](image) Belgium | 4\n | knockout: 4 matches\n |\n| 5\n | 1976 | ![](image) Yugoslavia |\n| 6\n | 1980 | ![](image) Italy | 8\n | 14\n | 2 groups of 4 teams: 12 matches\n | final (round 1 group winners) and third-place match (round 1 group runners-up)\n |\n| 7\n | 1984 | ![](image) France | 15\n | knockout of 4 teams (round 1 group winners and runners-up): 3 matches\n |\n| 8\n | 1988 | ![](image) West Germany |\n| 9\n | 1992 | ![](image) Sweden |\n| 10\n | 1996 | ![](image) England | 16\n | 31\n | 4 groups of 4 teams: 24 matches\n | knockout of 8 teams (round 1 group winners and runners-up): 7 matches\n |\n| 11\n | 2000 | ![](image) Belgium![](image) Netherlands |\n| 12\n | 2004 | ![](image) Portugal |\n| 13\n | 2008 | ![](image) Austria![](image)  Switzerland |\n| 14\n | 2012 | ![](image) Poland![](image) Ukraine |\n| 15\n | 2016 | ![](image) France | 24\n | 51\n | 6 groups of 4 teams: 36 matches\n | knockout of 16 teams (round 1 group winners and runners-up, plus four best third-placed teams): 15 matches\n |\n| 16\n | 2020[s 1] | ![](image) Europe[s 2] |\n| *17* | *2024* | *![](image) Germany* |\n| *18* | *2028* | *![](image) England![](image) Northern Ireland![](image) Republic of Ireland![](image) Scotland![](image) Wales* |\n| *19* | *2032* | *![](image) Italy![](image) Turkey* |\n\n\n1. **^** Postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe\n2. **^** Pan–European edition hosted by eleven countries: Azerbaijan, Denmark, England, Germany, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Romania, Russia, Scotland and Spain\n\nUp to 1968 draws were to be broken via a coin toss in all matches but the final, draw in final match was resolved via a replay.\n\n\nNo third place play-off has been played since 1980.\n\n\n\n### Qualifying[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA European Championship qualifying\n\nTo qualify, a team must finish in one of the qualifying spots or win a play-off. After this, a team proceeds to the finals round in the host country, although hosts qualify for the tournament automatically. The qualifying phase begins in the autumn after the preceding FIFA World Cup, almost two years before the finals.\n\n\nThe groups for qualification are drawn by a UEFA committee using seeding. Seeded teams include reigning champions and other teams based on their performance in the preceding FIFA World Cup qualifying and the last European Championship qualifying. To obtain an accurate view of the teams' abilities, a ranking is produced. This is calculated by taking the total number of points won by a particular team and dividing it by the number of games played, i.e. points per game. In the case of a team having hosted one of the two previous competitions and therefore having qualified automatically, only the results from the single most recent qualifying competition are used. If two teams have equal points per game, the committee then bases their positions in the rankings on:\n\n\n\n1. Coefficient from the matches played in its most recent qualifying competition.\n2. Average goal difference.\n3. Average number of goals scored.\n4. Average number of away goals scored.\n5. Drawing of lots.\n\n\nThe qualifying phase is played in a group format, the composition of the groups is determined through means of a draw of teams from pre-defined seeded bowls. The draw takes place after the preceding World Cup's qualifying competition. For UEFA Euro 2020, the group qualifying phase consisted of ten groups; five of six teams and the remainder of five teams each.\n\n\nEach group is played in a league format with teams playing each other home and away. The top two teams then qualified for the final tournament, with remaining places decided by playoffs depending on their ranking in the UEFA Nations League. As with most leagues, the points are awarded as three for a win, one for a draw, and none for a loss. In the eventuality of one or more teams having equal points after all matches have been played, the following criteria are used to distinguish the sides:\n\n\n\n1. Higher number of points obtained in the group matches played among the teams in question.\n2. Superior goal difference from the group matches played among the teams in question.\n3. Higher number of goals scored in the group matches played among the teams in question.\n4. Higher number of goals scored away from home in the group matches played among the teams in question.\n5. Results of all group matches:\n\t1. Superior goal difference\n\t2. Higher number of goals scored\n\t3. Higher number of goals scored away from home\n\t4. Fair play conduct.\n6. Drawing of lots.\n\n\n### Final tournament[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Map of countries' best results. 10 countries have won, counting Germany and West Germany as one\nSixteen teams progressed to the final tournament for the 2012 tournament. They were joint hosts Poland and Ukraine, the winners and the highest ranked second-placed team from the nine qualifying groups as well as the winners of four play-off matches between the runners-up of the other groups. These sixteen teams were divided equally into four groups, A, B, C and D, each consisting of four teams. The groups were drawn up by the UEFA administration, again using seeding. The seeded teams being the host nations, the reigning champions, should they qualify, and those with the best points per game coefficients over the qualifying phase of the tournament and the previous World Cup qualifying. Other finalists were assigned to by means of a draw, using coefficients as a basis.\n\n\nFor the 2016 tournament, the expansion to 24 teams means that the teams will be drawn into six groups of four, with the six group winners, six group runners-up and the four best third-placed teams advancing to the round of 16 when it becomes a knockout competition.[77]\n\n\nThe groups are again played in a league format, where a team plays its opponents once each. The same points system is used (three points for a win, one point for a draw, no points for a defeat). A schedule for the group matches will be drawn up, but the last two matches in a group must kick off simultaneously. The winner and runner-up of each group progress to the next round, where a knockout system is used (the two teams play each other once, the winner progresses), this is used in all subsequent rounds as well. The winners of the quarter-finals matches progress to the semi-finals, where the winners play in the final. If in any of the knockout rounds, the scores are still equal after normal playing time, extra time and penalties are employed to separate the two teams. Unlike the FIFA World Cup, this tournament no longer has a third place playoff.\n\n\n\n## Results[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of UEFA European Championship finals\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Year\n | Host\n |  | Final\n |  | Third place playoff\n |  | Number of teams\n |\n| Winners\n | Score and venue\n | Runners-up\n | Third place\n | Score and venue\n | Fourth place\n |\n| 1960 | ![](image) France | **![](image)Soviet Union** | **2–1** (a.e.t.)Parc des Princes, Paris | ![](image)Yugoslavia | ![](image)Czechoslovakia | 2–0 Stade Vélodrome, Marseille | ![](image)France | 4\n |\n| 1964 | ![](image) Spain | **![](image)Spain** | **2–1**Santiago Bernabéu, Madrid | ![](image)Soviet Union | ![](image)Hungary | 3–1 (a.e.t.)Camp Nou, Barcelona | ![](image)Denmark | 4\n |\n| 1968 | ![](image) Italy | **![](image)Italy** | **1–1** (a.e.t.)**2–0** (replay)Stadio Olimpico, Rome | ![](image)Yugoslavia | ![](image)England | 2–0 Stadio Olimpico, Rome | ![](image)Soviet Union | 4\n |\n| 1972 | ![](image) Belgium | **![](image)West Germany** | **3–0**Heysel Stadium, Brussels | ![](image)Soviet Union | ![](image)Belgium | 2–1Stade Maurice Dufrasne, Liège | ![](image)Hungary | 4\n |\n| 1976 | ![](image) Yugoslavia | **![](image)Czechoslovakia** | **2–2** (a.e.t.)(5–3 p)Red Star Stadium, Belgrade | ![](image)West Germany | ![](image)Netherlands | 3–2 (a.e.t.)Stadion Maksimir, Zagreb | ![](image)Yugoslavia | 4\n |\n| 1980 | ![](image) Italy | **![](image)West Germany** | **2–1**Stadio Olimpico, Rome | ![](image)Belgium | ![](image)Czechoslovakia | 1–1 [a](9–8 p)Stadio San Paolo, Naples | ![](image)Italy | 8\n |\n| Losing semi-finalists[b] |\n| 1984 | ![](image) France | **![](image)France** | **2–0**Parc des Princes, Paris | ![](image)Spain | ![](image) Denmark and ![](image) Portugal | 8\n |\n| 1988 | ![](image) West Germany | **![](image)Netherlands** | **2–0**Olympiastadion, Munich | ![](image)Soviet Union | ![](image) Italy and ![](image) West Germany | 8\n |\n| 1992 | ![](image) Sweden | **![](image)Denmark** | **2–0**Ullevi, Gothenburg | ![](image)Germany | ![](image) Netherlands and ![](image) Sweden | 8\n |\n| 1996 | ![](image) England | **![](image)Germany** | **2–1** (g.g.)Wembley Stadium, London | ![](image)Czech Republic | ![](image) England and ![](image) France | 16\n |\n| 2000 | ![](image) Belgium![](image) Netherlands | **![](image)France** | **2–1** (g.g.)De Kuip, Rotterdam | ![](image)Italy | ![](image) Netherlands and ![](image) Portugal | 16\n |\n| 2004 | ![](image) Portugal | **![](image)Greece** | **1–0**Estádio da Luz, Lisbon | ![](image)Portugal | ![](image) Czech Republic and ![](image) Netherlands | 16\n |\n| 2008 | ![](image) Austria![](image)  Switzerland | **![](image)Spain** | **1–0**Ernst-Happel-Stadion, Vienna | ![](image)Germany | ![](image) Russia and ![](image) Turkey | 16\n |\n| 2012 | ![](image) Poland![](image) Ukraine | **![](image)Spain** | **4–0**Olimpiyskiy, Kyiv | ![](image)Italy | ![](image) Germany and ![](image) Portugal | 16\n |\n| 2016 | ![](image) France | **![](image)Portugal** | **1–0** (a.e.t.)

You can help by updating items to more recent figures from official sources.\n\n![](image)Cartogram of the world's population in 2018; each square represents 500,000 people.\nThis is a **list of countries and dependencies by population**. It includes sovereign states, inhabited dependent territories and, in some cases, constituent countries of sovereign states, with inclusion within the list being primarily based on the ISO standard ISO 3166-1. For instance, the United Kingdom is considered a single entity, while the constituent countries of the Kingdom of the Netherlands are considered separately. In addition, this list includes certain states with limited recognition not found in ISO 3166-1. Also given in a percentage is each country's population compared with the world population, which the United Nations estimates at 8.11 billion as of 2023[update].[1]\n\n\n\n\n## Method[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of countries and dependencies by population density and List of regional organizations by population\n\nFigures used in this chart are based on the most up-to-date estimates or projections by the national census authority, where available, and are usually rounded off.\n\n\nWhere updated national data are not available, figures are based on the estimates or projections for 2022 by the Population Division of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs.\n\n\nBecause the compiled figures are not collected at the same time in every country, or at the same level of accuracy, the resulting numerical comparisons may create misleading conclusions. Furthermore, the addition of figures from all countries may not equal the world total.\n\n\nAreas that form integral parts of sovereign states, such as the countries of the United Kingdom, are counted as part of the sovereign states concerned. Not included are other entities that are not sovereign states, such as the European Union,[a] and independent territories that do not have permanent populations, such as the Chagos Archipelago and various countries' claims to Antarctica.[2]\n\n\n\n## Sovereign states and dependencies by population[edit]\n\n\nNote: A numbered rank is assigned to the 193 member states of the United Nations, plus the two observer states to the United Nations General Assembly. Dependent territories and constituent countries that are parts of sovereign states are not assigned a numbered rank. In addition, sovereign states with limited recognition are included, but not assigned a number rank.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n|  | Country / Dependency | Population | % ofworld | Date | Source (official or

sovereign members delegate to it by treaty certain powers that are often exercised by sovereign states. Its combined population has been estimated at 447,319,916 on 1 January 2020, and it would be ranked 3rd if it were included in the list. It has 5.51% of the world's population — see \"Eurostat-Tables, Graphs and Maps Interface（TGM）table\". European Commission.\n2. **^** Refers to Mainland China; excludes China's special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau, which returned to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 and 1999, respectively.\n3. **^** Includes the population of the India-administered union territories of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh. According to UN estimates, India is set to surpass China by the end of Apr 2023.[6]\n4. **^** Includes the 50 states and the District of Columbia, but excludes the territories of the United States.\n5. **^** Includes the population of Pakistan-administered Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan.\n6. **^** Includes the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol, administrative areas on the Crimean Peninsula occupied by Russia. The Ukrainian government and most of the world's other states consider the Crimean Peninsula part of Ukraine's territory.\n7. **^** Includes the integral 18 regions of France (including 5 overseas departments and regions). Excludes France's 5 overseas collectivities: French Polynesia, Saint Barthélemy, Saint Martin, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, and Wallis and Futuna, and the sui generis collectivity of New Caledonia, which are shown separately. The French Southern and Antarctic Lands (an Antarctic territorial claim hosting only government officials and research station staff) and Clipperton Island (an uninhabited state private property of France) are not listed at all due to their extraordinary nature.\n8. **^** Excludes the 3 British Crown Dependencies and the 14 British Overseas Territories, listed separately. Four British Overseas Territories are not listed due to their extraordinary nature. The 4 not listed are *British Antarctic Territory* (an Antarctic territorial claim hosting only government officials and research station staff), the British Indian Ocean Territory (a military base), South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands (hosts only government officials and research station staff), and the Sovereign Base Areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia (a military base where permanent residency is limited to citizens of the Republic of Cyprus).\n9. **^** Includes Zanzibar.\n10. **^** Excludes the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol, Ukraine's *de jure* territory which is occupied by Russia (however, includes the Donbas region, partly occupied by Russia).\n11. **^** Excludes the disputed territory of Western Sahara (Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic).\n12. **^** Excludes the external territories of Christmas Island, the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, and Norfolk Island.\n13. **^** Taiwan includes Penghu, Kinmen, Matsu and other minor islands.\n14. **^** Includes Somaliland.\n15. **^** Excludes the three constituent countries of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in the Caribbean Sea (Aruba, Curaçao, and Sint Maarten), but includes the three special municipalities of the Caribbean Netherlands (Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba).\n16. **^** Includes East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights.

The Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic's administrative control is limited to approximately 20% of the territory, with the remaining 80% of the territory occupied by Morocco. The United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara is the United Nations peacekeeping mission to the territory (see Western Sahara conflict).\n27. **^** *De facto* independent, *de jure* part of Cyprus.\n28. **^** *De facto* independent, *de jure* part of Moldova.\n29. **^** The political status of Abkhazia is disputed. Having unilaterally declared independence from Georgia in 1992, Abkhazia is formally recognised as an independent state by 5 UN member states (two other states previously recognised it but then withdrew their recognition), while the remainder of the international community recognizes it as as *de jure* Georgian territory. Georgia continues to claim the area as its own territory, designating it as Russian-occupied territory.\n30. **^** *De facto* independent, *de jure* part of Azerbaijan. Artsakh has announced its intention to dissolve all state institutions and cease to exist by 1 January 2024.[193]\n31. **^** South Ossetia's status is disputed. It considers itself to be an independent state, but this is recognised by only a few other countries. The Georgian government and most of the world's other states consider South Ossetia *de jure* a part of Georgia's territory.\n32. **^** 764 residents regardless of citizenship, 618 citizens regardless of residence, 246 resident citizens.[234]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"World Population Dashboard\". *United Nations Population Fund*.

You can help by updating items to more recent figures from official sources.\n\n![](image)Cartogram of the world's population in 2018; each square represents 500,000 people.\nThis is a **list of countries and dependencies by population**. It includes sovereign states, inhabited dependent territories and, in some cases, constituent countries of sovereign states, with inclusion within the list being primarily based on the ISO standard ISO 3166-1. For instance, the United Kingdom is considered a single entity, while the constituent countries of the Kingdom of the Netherlands are considered separately. In addition, this list includes certain states with limited recognition not found in ISO 3166-1. Also given in a percentage is each country's population compared with the world population, which the United Nations estimates at 8.11 billion as of 2023[update].[1]\n\n\n\n\n## Method[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of countries and dependencies by population density and List of regional organizations by population\n\nFigures used in this chart are based on the most up-to-date estimates or projections by the national census authority, where available, and are usually rounded off.\n\n\nWhere updated national data are not available, figures are based on the estimates or projections for 2022 by the Population Division of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs.\n\n\nBecause the compiled figures are not collected at the same time in every country, or at the same level of accuracy, the resulting numerical comparisons may create misleading conclusions. Furthermore, the addition of figures from all countries may not equal the world total.\n\n\nAreas that form integral parts of sovereign states, such as the countries of the United Kingdom, are counted as part of the sovereign states concerned. Not included are other entities that are not sovereign states, such as the European Union,[a] and independent territories that do not have permanent populations, such as the Chagos Archipelago and various countries' claims to Antarctica.[2]\n\n\n\n## Sovereign states and dependencies by population[edit]\n\n\nNote: A numbered rank is assigned to the 193 member states of the United Nations, plus the two observer states to the United Nations General Assembly. Dependent territories and constituent countries that are parts of sovereign states are not assigned a numbered rank. In addition, sovereign states with limited recognition are included, but not assigned a number rank.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n|  | Country / Dependency | Population | % ofworld | Date | Source (official or

sovereign members delegate to it by treaty certain powers that are often exercised by sovereign states. Its combined population has been estimated at 447,319,916 on 1 January 2020, and it would be ranked 3rd if it were included in the list. It has 5.51% of the world's population — see \"Eurostat-Tables, Graphs and Maps Interface（TGM）table\". European Commission.\n2. **^** Refers to Mainland China; excludes China's special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau, which returned to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 and 1999, respectively.\n3. **^** Includes the population of the India-administered union territories of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh. According to UN estimates, India is set to surpass China by the end of Apr 2023.[6]\n4. **^** Includes the 50 states and the District of Columbia, but excludes the territories of the United States.\n5. **^** Includes the population of Pakistan-administered Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan.\n6. **^** Includes the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol, administrative areas on the Crimean Peninsula occupied by Russia. The Ukrainian government and most of the world's other states consider the Crimean Peninsula part of Ukraine's territory.\n7. **^** Includes the integral 18 regions of France (including 5 overseas departments and regions). Excludes France's 5 overseas collectivities: French Polynesia, Saint Barthélemy, Saint Martin, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, and Wallis and Futuna, and the sui generis collectivity of New Caledonia, which are shown separately. The French Southern and Antarctic Lands (an Antarctic territorial claim hosting only government officials and research station staff) and Clipperton Island (an uninhabited state private property of France) are not listed at all due to their extraordinary nature.\n8. **^** Excludes the 3 British Crown Dependencies and the 14 British Overseas Territories, listed separately. Four British Overseas Territories are not listed due to their extraordinary nature. The 4 not listed are *British Antarctic Territory* (an Antarctic territorial claim hosting only government officials and research station staff), the British Indian Ocean Territory (a military base), South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands (hosts only government officials and research station staff), and the Sovereign Base Areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia (a military base where permanent residency is limited to citizens of the Republic of Cyprus).\n9. **^** Includes Zanzibar.\n10. **^** Excludes the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol, Ukraine's *de jure* territory which is occupied by Russia (however, includes the Donbas region, partly occupied by Russia).\n11. **^** Excludes the disputed territory of Western Sahara (Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic).\n12. **^** Excludes the external territories of Christmas Island, the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, and Norfolk Island.\n13. **^** Taiwan includes Penghu, Kinmen, Matsu and other minor islands.\n14. **^** Includes Somaliland.\n15. **^** Excludes the three constituent countries of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in the Caribbean Sea (Aruba, Curaçao, and Sint Maarten), but includes the three special municipalities of the Caribbean Netherlands (Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba).\n16. **^** Includes East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights.

The Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic's administrative control is limited to approximately 20% of the territory, with the remaining 80% of the territory occupied by Morocco. The United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara is the United Nations peacekeeping mission to the territory (see Western Sahara conflict).\n27. **^** *De facto* independent, *de jure* part of Cyprus.\n28. **^** *De facto* independent, *de jure* part of Moldova.\n29. **^** The political status of Abkhazia is disputed. Having unilaterally declared independence from Georgia in 1992, Abkhazia is formally recognised as an independent state by 5 UN member states (two other states previously recognised it but then withdrew their recognition), while the remainder of the international community recognizes it as as *de jure* Georgian territory. Georgia continues to claim the area as its own territory, designating it as Russian-occupied territory.\n30. **^** *De facto* independent, *de jure* part of Azerbaijan. Artsakh has announced its intention to dissolve all state institutions and cease to exist by 1 January 2024.[193]\n31. **^** South Ossetia's status is disputed. It considers itself to be an independent state, but this is recognised by only a few other countries. The Georgian government and most of the world's other states consider South Ossetia *de jure* a part of Georgia's territory.\n32. **^** 764 residents regardless of citizenship, 618 citizens regardless of residence, 246 resident citizens.[234]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"World Population Dashboard\". *United Nations Population Fund*.
