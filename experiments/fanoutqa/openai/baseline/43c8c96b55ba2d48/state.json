In the case of jersey numbers, they are usually no longer available for future players to wear, although they can ask for permission from players whose jerseys are retired. Teams usually display these numbers by hanging banners on the rafters inside their home arena. As of 2022, only two teams in the NBA do not have any retired numbers: the Los Angeles Clippers and the Toronto Raptors. Two players have had their numbers retired by teams they did not play for, and only one player (Bill Russell) had his number retired league wide.\n\n\n\n\n## List[edit]\n\n\n**Key:**\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u2020\u00a0\nInducted to the Basketball Hall of Fame\n\u00a0\u2021\u00a0\nNumber retired league-wide\n\n\nRetired NBA numbers\n| No.\n | Name\n | Team\n | Pos.\n | Years with franchise\n | Note\n | Refs\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 9 | Bob Pettit\u2020\n | Atlanta Hawks | F | 1954\u20131965 | Did not play for franchise in Atlanta.
