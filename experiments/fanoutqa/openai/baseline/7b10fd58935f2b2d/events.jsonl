The band's current touring line-up also includes former core member Sarah Neufeld and multi-instrumentalists Paul Beaubrun, Dan Boeckner and Eric Heigle. Each of the band's studio albums features contributions from composer and violinist Owen Pallett.\n\n\nFounded in 2001 by friends and classmates Butler and Josh Deu, the band came to prominence in 2004 with the release of their critically acclaimed debut album *Funeral*. Their second studio album, *Neon Bible*, won them the 2008 Meteor Music Award for Best International Album and the 2008 Juno Award for Alternative Album of the Year. Their third studio album, *The Suburbs*, was released in 2010 to critical acclaim and commercial success.[2] It received many accolades, including the 2011 Grammy for Album of the Year, the 2011 Juno Award for Album of the Year and the 2011 Brit Award for Best International Album. In 2013, Arcade Fire released their fourth album, *Reflektor*, and scored the feature film *Her*, for which band members Will Butler and Owen Pallett were nominated in the Best Original Score category at the 86th Academy Awards. In 2017, the band released their fifth studio album *Everything Now*, which was succeeded by their sixth studio album *We* in 2022.[3]\n\n\nAll the band's studio albums have received nominations for Best Alternative Music Album at the Grammys. *Funeral* is widely considered by music critics to be one of the greatest albums of the 2000s.[4] The band's work has also been named three times as a shortlist nominee for the Polaris Music Prize: in 2007 for *Neon Bible*, in 2011 for *The Suburbs* and in 2014 for *Reflektor*.\n\n\nThe band has been described as indie rock,[5] art rock,[6] dance-rock,[7][8] and baroque pop.[9] They play guitar, drums, bass guitar, piano, violin, viola, cello, double bass, xylophone, glockenspiel, keyboard, synthesizer, French horn, accordion, harp, mandolin and hurdy-gurdy, and take most of these instruments on tour; the multi-instrumentalist band members switch duties throughout shows.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### 2001–2003: Formation and early work[edit]\n\n\nWin Butler and Josh Deu founded Arcade Fire in Montreal around 2001, having first met at Phillips Exeter Academy as high school students.[10] Butler and Deu's musical ideas began to develop and the first incarnation of the band was born while they were attending McGill University and Concordia University, respectively.[11][12] The duo began rehearsing their material at McGill where they met Régine Chassagne, a music student whom they asked to join them. Deu recalls, \"Win and I played guitar. Everyone played guitar. We had no music to show her, but she ended up saying yes to joining us, and I don't know why. Maybe there was a little spark with Win.\"[11] Halfway through 2001, the band consisted of Butler, Chassagne, Deu, multi-instrumentalist Tim Kile (later of Wild Light), bassist Myles Broscoe (later of Les Angles Morts, Crystal Clyffs, and AIDS Wolf), guitarist/drummer Dane Mills (later of Crackpot) and multi-instrumentalist Brendan Reed (later of Les Angles Morts and founding member of Clues), who lived with Butler and Chassagne in Montreal's Mile End neighbourhood at the time and was a collaborator with them on song-writing and arrangement (2001–2003). During a party in 2001, the band recorded a live Christmas album, *A Very Arcade Xmas*, which they are rumored to have hand-distributed to their friends as a Christmas gift.[13]\n\n\nThe initial Montreal structure of the band began to dissolve in the summer of 2002, when they travelled to Butler's family farm on Mount Desert Island, Maine to record their self-titled EP.[14] Tension between Butler and bassist Myles Broscoe led the latter to exit the band following the recording session. Richard Reed Parry, who had been enlisted to help the band record, began to collaborate with them during the sessions and would go on to join the band shortly afterwards. Around the same time, Joshua Deu left the band to resume his studies; he continued to collaborate on the visual aspects of the band.[11] In the winter of 2003, the band celebrated the release of its EP with a show at Montreal's Casa del Popolo. Before a crowd packed beyond capacity, the band's set ended (in the middle of an encore) with an argument between Butler and Reed, who quit the band on-stage.[15] Mills told gathered friends in the crowd immediately thereafter that he considered the band to have broken up, as such resigning from the band as well. Following the on-stage implosion, Butler's brother Will Butler (subject of the early Arcade Fire song \"William Pierce Butler\") and Tim Kingsbury were brought in to replace Reed and Mills so that the band could continue, and they set out to promote the self-titled EP. The eponymous release (often referred to by fans as the *Us Kids Know EP*) was sold at early shows. After the band achieved fame, the EP was subsequently remastered and given a full release.[16]\n\n\nHoward Bilerman joined the band on drums in the summer of 2003, and they began to play shows together, and record the album that would end up becoming *Funeral*. The promise shown by the new band in their early live shows allowed them to land a record contract with the independent record label, Merge Records, before the end of their first year together.[17]\n\n\nWhen asked about the rumour that the band's name refers to a fire in an arcade, Win Butler replied: \"It's not a rumour, it's based on a story that someone told me. It's not an actual event, but one that I took to be real. I would say that it's probably something that the kid made up, but at the time I believed him.\"[18]\n\n\n\n### 2004–2006: *Funeral*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Funeral (Arcade Fire album)\n\n*Funeral* was released in September 2004 in Canada and February 2005 in Great Britain. The title of the debut album referred to the deaths of several relatives of band members (prominently the Butlers' grandfather, composer/arranger Alvino Rey) during its recording. These events created a somber atmosphere that influenced songs such as \"Une année sans lumière\" (\"A Year Without Light\"), \"In the Backseat\", and \"Haïti\", Chassagne's elegy to her homeland.[19]\n\n\nIt received widespread critical acclaim and topped many year-end and decade-end lists. According to the website Metacritic, the album had the second most appearances on end-of-decade Top 10 lists, only behind Radiohead's *Kid A*.[4] In the updated version of *Rolling Stone'*s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, it was ranked at #151.\n\n\nThe album was critically and commercially acclaimed. It appeared on many top ten album lists for 2004 and 2005 (due to delayed international releases), with Pitchfork, *Filter*, No Ripcord, and The MTV2 2005 Review crowning it the album of the year. *NME* named *Funeral* second[20] in their list of 2005's best albums. NME also named \"Rebellion (Lies)\" the second best track.\nBy November 2005, *Funeral* had gone gold in both Canada and the UK, and sold over half a million copies worldwide,[21] a very large number for an independent release with minimal television or radio exposure. The album became Merge Records' first in the *Billboard* 200 chart[22] and the label's biggest selling album to date, surpassing Neutral Milk Hotel's *In the Aeroplane Over the Sea*.[23]\n\n\n\n![](image)Arcade Fire performing in May 2005\nThe band booked small clubs for their 2004 tour, but growing interest forced many venue changes, far beyond the band's expectations, and the tour continued into mid-2005 throughout the United States, Canada, Europe, the SummerSonic Festival in Japan, and the Hillside Festival in Guelph. Taking much of the summer of 2005 off, the band made key festival appearances at the Halifax Pop Explosion, Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, the Sasquatch! Music Festival, Lollapalooza, Vegoose Festival, Reading and Leeds Festival in the UK, Electric Picnic in Ireland and the Lowlands Festival in the Netherlands.\n\n\nArcade Fire was featured on the April 4, 2005 cover of *Time'*s Canadian edition. On May 1, 2005, the band performed at the Coachella Valley Music & Arts Festival.[24] In May 2005, the band signed a short-term publishing contract with EMI for *Funeral*, and in June the band released a new single, \"Cold Wind\", on *Six Feet Under, Vol. 2: Everything Ends*. The BBC used the track \"Wake Up\" on an advertisement for their autumn 2005 season, and the tracks \"Rebellion (Lies)\" and \"Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels)\" on adverts in January 2006. On September 9, 2005, the band appeared on the British/US television special \"Fashion Rocks\", on which David Bowie joined them for \"Wake Up\". This recording, as well as recordings of the band's collaboration on Bowie's \"Life on Mars\" and \"Five Years\", were made available on the iTunes Music Store in a virtual live EP. The same trip to New York City took them to the *Late Show with David Letterman* and a concert in Central Park. The Central Park show featured a surprise appearance by Bowie. On September 11, 2005, Arcade Fire appeared on the long-running BBC music series *Top of the Pops*, performing \"Rebellion (Lies)\". The band also performed to a TV audience in Paris for Canal+, and the show was later screened on the British television's Channel 4. The band scored two number one songs on MTV2 (UK) *NME* Chart Show, with \"Neighborhood #3 (Power Out)\" and a three-week run with \"Wake Up\". This success followed Rough Trade Records's last-minute decision to release \"Wake Up\" only on 7\"\nvinyl.[25]\n\n\n\"Wake Up\" was played immediately before the Irish rock group U2 started their concerts on their 2005–06 Vertigo Tour; Arcade Fire subsequently opened three shows for that tour, and at the third in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, appeared on stage during U2's encore to join in a cover of Joy Division's \"Love Will Tear Us Apart\".[26] Additionally, *The Dan Patrick Show*, a daily national sports talk show in the US, plays the song as a lead-out every Friday to signify the end of their show. The song was also heard numerous times during the Super Bowl telecast on February 5, 2010.\n\n\n*Funeral* and the single \"Cold Wind\" were nominated for Grammys in the Best Alternative Rock Album and Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media categories (*Six Feet Under, Vol. 2: Everything Ends*), respectively. On April 2, 2006, in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Arcade Fire received the Juno Award for Songwriters Of The Year for three songs from *Funeral*: \"Wake Up\", \"Rebellion (Lies)\", and \"Neighborhood #3 (Power Out)\".[27] The band was nominated for three BRIT Awards: Best International Group, Best International Album, and Best International Breakthrough Act.[28]\n\n\nArcade Fire made an appearance on the BBC show *Later with Jools Holland* on May 12, 2005, performing \"Power Out\" and \"Rebellion (Lies)\". On December 27, 2005, *Funeral* was ranked No.1 on MTV2's \"50 Greatest Albums of the Year\" in the United Kingdom.[*citation needed*] On October 22, 2007, *Funeral* was ranked No.8 in Bob Mersereau's book *The Top 100 Canadian Albums*.[29] In late 2009, Pitchfork ranked the album No.2 in their list of the top 200 albums of the 2000s, behind Radiohead's *Kid A*.[30]\n\n\n\n### 2006–2010: *Neon Bible*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Neon Bible\n\n![](image)Arcade Fire performing in support of *Neon Bible* at the United Palace Theater on May 7, 2007\nDuring the downtime between *Funeral* and the beginning of recording sessions for *Neon Bible*, the band purchased a defunct church in the small Quebec town of Farnham, approximately 70 kilometres (43 mi) southeast of Montreal, and spent the early part of 2006 converting it into a recording studio.[31]\n\n\nThe first track officially released from *Neon Bible* was \"Intervention\" in December 2006 on iTunes. Proceeds from this release were dedicated to Partners in Health.[32] An error resulted in a second song, \"Black Wave/Bad Vibrations\", appearing on iTunes for a short time. The album was leaked to peer-to-peer networks on January 26, 2007, and was officially released March 5, 2007 in the UK and March 6 in North America. *Neon Bible* premiered at number 1 on the Canadian Albums Chart and the Irish Album Charts, and number 2 on the US *Billboard* Top 200 charts and the UK Top 40 Album Chart for the week of March 12, 2007.[33] The album was also number 1 on the Rock and Indie album charts. The first proper single, \"Black Mirror\", reached the No. 1 spot on CBC Radio 3's *R3-30* chart for five consecutive weeks, from March 22 to April 19, 2007, and was the first single by any band ever to spend more than two weeks atop the chart. The album gained much critical acclaim (even being mooted as a strong contender for album of the year), and because of its success saw the band proclaimed the most exciting act on the earth by British music magazine *Q*. *Paste* voted it one of the five best albums of 2007.[34] *Trouser Press* writer Jason Reeher ranked *Neon Bible* \"among the best indie rock recordings of all time\".[35]\n\n\nArcade Fire made their first appearance on *Saturday Night Live* on February 24, 2007 (Episode 618), performing \"Intervention\" and \"Keep the Car Running\".[36] Owen Pallett was not present as he was recording for his solo project. During the performance, one of Win Butler's guitar strings broke, prompting him to rip the strings from his acoustic guitar and smash it on the floor until it shattered. On this guitar, \"sak vide pa kanpe\" was written in duct tape across the front. A Haitian proverb meaning \"An empty sack cannot stand up\" in Creole, this may have been a reference to the extreme poverty of Haiti, the country of origin of Régine Chassagne.[37]\n\n\n\n![](image)Arcade Fire in July 2007\nOn July 10, 2007, *Neon Bible* was named to the shortlist for the 2007 Polaris Music Prize. Patrick Watson was announced as the winner at a gala ceremony on September 24, 2007.[38][39][40] However, due to the band's preference not to participate in compilation albums, they were the only nominee not to have a track on the Polaris promotional compilation 2007 Polaris Music Prize. Some media initially reported that the Polaris committee had snubbed the band by excluding them, leading the band and the committee to issue a joint press release confirming that the band chose not to have a track included on the album.[41]\n\n\nThe *Neon Bible* tour continued into September 2007 with 25+ dates scheduled in North America and Europe through mid-November. In Paris the band did a Take-Away Show video session shot by Vincent Moon.[42] The band toured Australia and New Zealand for the first time in early 2008 as part of the 2008 Big Day Out festival. On October 14, 2007, Win Butler and Régine Chassagne made a surprise guest appearance at a Bruce Springsteen show in Ottawa, playing \"State Trooper\" and \"Keep the Car Running\".[43] The band committed to give Partners in Health $1.00, £1.00, or €1.00 of every ticket sold on its 2008 European and North American tours.[44]\n\n\nArcade Fire further helped PIH, when it recorded \"Lenin\" on Red Hot Organization's latest album, *Dark Was the Night*. Sales from DWTN generated over $850,000 in money donated to AIDS related charities—$300,000 of which was given to PIH on Arcade Fire's behalf.\n\n\nIn February 2008, Win Butler announced on the band's journal that the *Neon Bible* tour had come to an end, after one year of touring and a total of 122 shows (including 33 festivals) in 75 cities and 19 countries.[45]\nCritics met the self-produced *Neon Bible* with acclaim. Publications like *NME* and *IGN* praised the album for its grandiose nature.[46][47]\n\n\nWin Butler has been a vocal supporter of Barack Obama since the end of the New Hampshire Primary.[48] Arcade Fire performed two free concerts for Obama in Cleveland and Nelsonville, Ohio on March 2, 2008 and March 3, 2008 before the state's March 4 primary.[49][50] The band, with Superchunk, performed another two free concerts for Obama on May 1 in Greensboro, North Carolina, and on May 2 in Carrboro, North Carolina before the state's May 6 primary.[51] On January 21, 2009, Arcade Fire and Jay-Z were the musical guests at the Obama Campaign Staff Ball at the DC Armory, at Obama's request. Butler thanked President Obama for his stated intent to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay, and repeatedly thanked the Obama staffers for their work during the election.\n\n\nThe band was rumoured to be working with producer Markus Dravs on the soundtrack for the Richard Kelly film *The Box*.[52] Win Butler denied the claims, but stated that he and Owen Pallett \"may do an instrumental piece or two\" for the film.[53]\n\n\nIn December 2008, *Pitchfork* reported the band set up the website miroir-noir.com to foreshadow the release of a concert film with the same title, reporting, \"Miroir Noir will feature live footage from the Neon Bible tour.\" The film was directed by Vincent Morisset.[54] It was made available to pre-order on December 15, 2008 with the digital version available to download immediately, and the DVD shipping March 31, 2009.[55][56]\n\n\nA re-recorded version of the band's song \"Wake Up\" from their 2004 debut album, *Funeral*, was used for the trailer of the Spike Jonze film *Where the Wild Things Are*, which was released in October 2009.[57] The song \"Wake Up\" has also become popular on sports radio talk shows in the US In 2009, two nationally syndicated shows—*The Dan Patrick Show* and *The Petros and Money Show*—frequently used the song as \"bumper\" music. The National Football League featured this recording in commercials throughout the broadcast of the 2010 Super Bowl. The band donated the proceeds from licensing the song to the NFL to the charity Partners In Health.[58]\n\n\n\n### 2010–2012: *The Suburbs*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: The Suburbs (Arcade Fire album)\n\nOn May 27, 2010, it was announced that a new double-sided 12\" single would be released the same day as the full album, called *The Suburbs*, on August 2 in the UK and on August 3 in the US and Canada.[59] The album is produced by Markus Dravs, who had worked with the band on their previous album, 2007's *Neon Bible,* and was engineered by Marcus Paquin, who has also previously worked with the band.[60] A track-by-track review ahead of *The Suburbs* release by The Quietus website said, \"The progression is similar to the one William Blake takes us through in *Songs of Innocence and of Experience* that suggests forward momentum and maturity.\"[61] The album was released with eight different covers.[62]\n\n\nThe first show announced was Oxegen 2010 which took place in Ireland in July.[63] The band announced that they would play songs from the new album in their headline performance at the Reading and Leeds Festivals in August 2010, with Win Butler noting, \"We're really looking forward to playing the new songs live... [it's] like an inventor emerging from his basement after a year's work.\"[64]\n\n\n\n![](image)Arcade Fire performing at Madison Square Garden in August 2010\nIn July 2010, Arcade Fire announced they would be broadcasting their August 5 concert at Madison Square Garden live via YouTube. They later announced the video would be directed by Terry Gilliam.[65] *The Suburbs* was released worldwide at the start of August 2010 to extensive critical acclaim comparable to *Funeral* and *Neon Bible*.[66] During the 2010 tour, Arcade Fire gave a tribute to Jay Reatard performing the cover of \"Oh, It's Such a Shame\". Win Butler confessed to Zane Lowe that the band wanted Jay Reatard to support the band on this tour, but he had died. *The Suburbs* went on to debut at number one in the US (on the Billboard 200), selling 156,000 units in its first week. It was also number one in the UK and Canada.\n\n\nIn August 2010, Arcade Fire and Google released an interactive music video, written and directed by Chris Milk and produced by B-Reel, which allows the viewer to enter the address where they grew up and the video is then \"geopersonalised\". This video utilizes the band's song \"We Used to Wait\" from *The Suburbs*, and showcases capabilities of HTML5 and Google's Chrome browser. On November 13, 2010, Arcade Fire made their second appearance on *Saturday Night Live*, performing \"We Used to Wait\" and \"Sprawl II (Mountains Beyond Mountains)\".[67]\n\n\nThe album debuted at No. 1 on the Irish Albums Chart, the UK Albums Chart, the US *Billboard* 200 chart,[68] and the Canadian Albums Chart.[69] It won Album of the Year at the 2011 Grammy Awards, Best International Album at the 2011 BRIT Awards, Album of the Year at the 2011 Juno Awards, and the 2011 Polaris Music Prize for best Canadian album. Two weeks after winning Grammy's Album of the Year, the album jumped from No. 52 to No. 12 on the *Billboard* 200, the album's highest ranking since August 2010.[70]\n\n\nIn a nod to the Butlers' maternal grandfather, Alvino Rey, who was an amateur radio operator, the logo used by the band from this time was a variation of that used by the American Radio Relay League. Also, when playing the single \"We Used to Wait\" live, the background video screen features a radio exchange between Rey and a Canadian operator having Call Sign VE3YV. The video also features many other amateur radio artifacts.\n\n\nArcade Fire performed at the 53rd Grammy Awards in February 2011. The band was nominated for Grammy Awards in three categories: Album of the Year, Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, and Best Alternative Music Album (for *The Suburbs*).[71] Out of the three nominations, they won the Grammy for Album of the Year, their second time to be nominated for the award.[72][73][74]\n\n\nAt the 2011 BRIT Awards, *The Suburbs* won Best International Album, and Arcade Fire won the Award for Best International Group.[75]\n\n\nIn March 2011, Arcade Fire was honoured at the Juno Awards of 2011. They won Group of the Year and Songwriter of the Year for \"Ready to Start\", \"Sprawl II (Mountains Beyond Mountains)\", and \"We Used to Wait\", all off *The Suburbs*. *The Suburbs* also won Album of the Year and Alternative Album of the Year.[76]\n\n\nOn April 19, 2011, it was announced that Arcade Fire would release a deluxe edition of their album *The Suburbs* featuring the short film *Scenes from the Suburbs*, by director Spike Jonze, as well as two new tracks, \"Culture War\" and \"Speaking in Tongues\" featuring David Byrne.[77] *Scenes from the Suburbs*, which debuted at the Berlin International Film Festival 2011, has a running time of 30 minutes.[78] The film screened at the SXSW Film Festival 2011 and saw its online premiere on MUBI on June 27, 2011.[79] Writing for the Canadian Press, Nick Patch called the film \"a sci-fi puzzler that seems to blend the paranoia of Terry Gilliam films with the nostalgia of classic Steven Spielberg flicks.\"[80]\n\n\nOn June 16, the album was named as a longlisted nominee (one of 40) for the 2011 Polaris Music Prize.[81] On July 6, the album was named as a shortlisted (one of 10) nominee for the 2011 award. On September 20, 2011, they were awarded the Polaris Prize.\n\n\nOn May 19, 2012, Arcade Fire (minus members Will and Tim) made their third appearance on *Saturday Night Live*, playing as a backup band for musical guest and host Mick Jagger. The band performed \"The Last Time\" with Jagger, and participated in Kristen Wiig's farewell skit, playing \"She's a Rainbow\" into \"Ruby Tuesday\". The band wore *carrés rouges* (red squares) to show support for the 2012 Quebec student protests.[82]\n\n\nArcade Fire recorded a song for *The Hunger Games* soundtrack (*The Hunger Games: Songs from District 12 and Beyond*), called \"Abraham's Daughter\". The song is featured in the movie's end credits. The soundtrack was released on March 20, 2012, debuting at number one on the *Billboard* 200.[83][84] It sold more than 175,000 copies in its first week according to Nielsen SoundScan. It's the first theatrical film soundtrack to top the chart since Michael Jackson's \"This Is It\" debuted at No. 1 on the list. It is also only the 16th soundtrack to debut at No. 1 in the history of the Billboard 200 chart (those soundtracks include film, television, and straight-to-video efforts).[83]\n\n\nArcade Fire also contributed to the movie's original score, *The Hunger Games: Original Motion Picture Score*. The group composed the grand, fascistic-inspired, ominous Panem national anthem, entitled \"Horn of Plenty\", an important and signature leitmotif appearing throughout the film.[85][86] \"We were interested in making music that would be more integral in the movie, just as a mental exercise,\" Butler, who co-wrote the song with Chassagne, explained. \"And there's an anthem that runs throughout the books, the national anthem of the fascist Capitol. So as a thought experiment, we tried to write what that might sound like. It's like the Capitol's idea of itself, basically.\"[85][86] He further added that \"it's not a pop song or anything. More of an anthem that could be playing at a big sporting event like the [Hunger] Games. So we did a structure for that, and then James Newton Howard made a movie-score version of it that happens in several places in the film.\"[85][86] Arcade Fire's Panem national anthem has received strong reviews. According to *Spin Mobile*, \"'Horn of Plenty' sounds both exactly like Arcade Fire and exactly like a futuristic anthem.\"[87]\n\n\n\n### 2013–2015: *Reflektor*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Reflektor\n\n> \n> \"There's a lot of them, and they're mostly self-produced – like, they don't need a producer in a certain way.

$300,000 was donated to Partners in Health.\n* 2010: The NFL purchased rights to \"Wake Up\" for Super Bowl XLIV; all proceeds went to Partners in Health.[58]\n* AF ♥ Haiti campaign: trained 50k+ volunteers to engage fans in Partners in Health's mission.[151]\n\n\n## Members[edit]\n\n\n* ![Win Butler](image)\n\nWin Butler\n* ![Régine Chassagne](image)\n\nRégine Chassagne\n* ![Richard Reed Parry](image)\n\nRichard Reed Parry\n* ![Tim Kingsbury](image)\n\nTim Kingsbury\n* ![Jeremy Gara](image)\n\nJeremy Gara\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Current members**\n* Win Butler – lead and backing vocals, guitar, piano, keyboards, bass guitar, mandolin (2001–present)\n* Régine Chassagne – backing and lead vocals, accordion, piano, keyboards, hurdy gurdy, recorder, drums, percussion (2001–present)\n* Richard Reed Parry – guitar, bass guitar, double bass, piano, keyboards, synthesizers, organ, celesta, accordion, drums, percussion, backing vocals (2003–present)\n* Tim Kingsbury – bass guitar, guitar, double bass, keyboards, backing vocals (2003–present)\n* Jeremy Gara – drums, percussion, guitar, keyboards (2004–present)\n\n**Current touring musicians**\n* Sarah Neufeld – violin, piano, keyboards, synthesizers, tambourine, xylophone, backing vocals (touring member 2013–present;

The band's current touring line-up also includes former core member Sarah Neufeld and multi-instrumentalists Paul Beaubrun, Dan Boeckner and Eric Heigle. Each of the band's studio albums features contributions from composer and violinist Owen Pallett.\n\n\nFounded in 2001 by friends and classmates Butler and Josh Deu, the band came to prominence in 2004 with the release of their critically acclaimed debut album *Funeral*. Their second studio album, *Neon Bible*, won them the 2008 Meteor Music Award for Best International Album and the 2008 Juno Award for Alternative Album of the Year. Their third studio album, *The Suburbs*, was released in 2010 to critical acclaim and commercial success.[2] It received many accolades, including the 2011 Grammy for Album of the Year, the 2011 Juno Award for Album of the Year and the 2011 Brit Award for Best International Album. In 2013, Arcade Fire released their fourth album, *Reflektor*, and scored the feature film *Her*, for which band members Will Butler and Owen Pallett were nominated in the Best Original Score category at the 86th Academy Awards. In 2017, the band released their fifth studio album *Everything Now*, which was succeeded by their sixth studio album *We* in 2022.[3]\n\n\nAll the band's studio albums have received nominations for Best Alternative Music Album at the Grammys. *Funeral* is widely considered by music critics to be one of the greatest albums of the 2000s.[4] The band's work has also been named three times as a shortlist nominee for the Polaris Music Prize: in 2007 for *Neon Bible*, in 2011 for *The Suburbs* and in 2014 for *Reflektor*.\n\n\nThe band has been described as indie rock,[5] art rock,[6] dance-rock,[7][8] and baroque pop.[9] They play guitar, drums, bass guitar, piano, violin, viola, cello, double bass, xylophone, glockenspiel, keyboard, synthesizer, French horn, accordion, harp, mandolin and hurdy-gurdy, and take most of these instruments on tour; the multi-instrumentalist band members switch duties throughout shows.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### 2001–2003: Formation and early work[edit]\n\n\nWin Butler and Josh Deu founded Arcade Fire in Montreal around 2001, having first met at Phillips Exeter Academy as high school students.[10] Butler and Deu's musical ideas began to develop and the first incarnation of the band was born while they were attending McGill University and Concordia University, respectively.[11][12] The duo began rehearsing their material at McGill where they met Régine Chassagne, a music student whom they asked to join them. Deu recalls, \"Win and I played guitar. Everyone played guitar. We had no music to show her, but she ended up saying yes to joining us, and I don't know why. Maybe there was a little spark with Win.\"[11] Halfway through 2001, the band consisted of Butler, Chassagne, Deu, multi-instrumentalist Tim Kile (later of Wild Light), bassist Myles Broscoe (later of Les Angles Morts, Crystal Clyffs, and AIDS Wolf), guitarist/drummer Dane Mills (later of Crackpot) and multi-instrumentalist Brendan Reed (later of Les Angles Morts and founding member of Clues), who lived with Butler and Chassagne in Montreal's Mile End neighbourhood at the time and was a collaborator with them on song-writing and arrangement (2001–2003). During a party in 2001, the band recorded a live Christmas album, *A Very Arcade Xmas*, which they are rumored to have hand-distributed to their friends as a Christmas gift.[13]\n\n\nThe initial Montreal structure of the band began to dissolve in the summer of 2002, when they travelled to Butler's family farm on Mount Desert Island, Maine to record their self-titled EP.[14] Tension between Butler and bassist Myles Broscoe led the latter to exit the band following the recording session. Richard Reed Parry, who had been enlisted to help the band record, began to collaborate with them during the sessions and would go on to join the band shortly afterwards. Around the same time, Joshua Deu left the band to resume his studies; he continued to collaborate on the visual aspects of the band.[11] In the winter of 2003, the band celebrated the release of its EP with a show at Montreal's Casa del Popolo. Before a crowd packed beyond capacity, the band's set ended (in the middle of an encore) with an argument between Butler and Reed, who quit the band on-stage.[15] Mills told gathered friends in the crowd immediately thereafter that he considered the band to have broken up, as such resigning from the band as well. Following the on-stage implosion, Butler's brother Will Butler (subject of the early Arcade Fire song \"William Pierce Butler\") and Tim Kingsbury were brought in to replace Reed and Mills so that the band could continue, and they set out to promote the self-titled EP. The eponymous release (often referred to by fans as the *Us Kids Know EP*) was sold at early shows. After the band achieved fame, the EP was subsequently remastered and given a full release.[16]\n\n\nHoward Bilerman joined the band on drums in the summer of 2003, and they began to play shows together, and record the album that would end up becoming *Funeral*. The promise shown by the new band in their early live shows allowed them to land a record contract with the independent record label, Merge Records, before the end of their first year together.[17]\n\n\nWhen asked about the rumour that the band's name refers to a fire in an arcade, Win Butler replied: \"It's not a rumour, it's based on a story that someone told me. It's not an actual event, but one that I took to be real. I would say that it's probably something that the kid made up, but at the time I believed him.\"[18]\n\n\n\n### 2004–2006: *Funeral*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Funeral (Arcade Fire album)\n\n*Funeral* was released in September 2004 in Canada and February 2005 in Great Britain. The title of the debut album referred to the deaths of several relatives of band members (prominently the Butlers' grandfather, composer/arranger Alvino Rey) during its recording. These events created a somber atmosphere that influenced songs such as \"Une année sans lumière\" (\"A Year Without Light\"), \"In the Backseat\", and \"Haïti\", Chassagne's elegy to her homeland.[19]\n\n\nIt received widespread critical acclaim and topped many year-end and decade-end lists. According to the website Metacritic, the album had the second most appearances on end-of-decade Top 10 lists, only behind Radiohead's *Kid A*.[4] In the updated version of *Rolling Stone'*s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, it was ranked at #151.\n\n\nThe album was critically and commercially acclaimed. It appeared on many top ten album lists for 2004 and 2005 (due to delayed international releases), with Pitchfork, *Filter*, No Ripcord, and The MTV2 2005 Review crowning it the album of the year. *NME* named *Funeral* second[20] in their list of 2005's best albums. NME also named \"Rebellion (Lies)\" the second best track.\nBy November 2005, *Funeral* had gone gold in both Canada and the UK, and sold over half a million copies worldwide,[21] a very large number for an independent release with minimal television or radio exposure. The album became Merge Records' first in the *Billboard* 200 chart[22] and the label's biggest selling album to date, surpassing Neutral Milk Hotel's *In the Aeroplane Over the Sea*.[23]\n\n\n\n![](image)Arcade Fire performing in May 2005\nThe band booked small clubs for their 2004 tour, but growing interest forced many venue changes, far beyond the band's expectations, and the tour continued into mid-2005 throughout the United States, Canada, Europe, the SummerSonic Festival in Japan, and the Hillside Festival in Guelph. Taking much of the summer of 2005 off, the band made key festival appearances at the Halifax Pop Explosion, Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, the Sasquatch! Music Festival, Lollapalooza, Vegoose Festival, Reading and Leeds Festival in the UK, Electric Picnic in Ireland and the Lowlands Festival in the Netherlands.\n\n\nArcade Fire was featured on the April 4, 2005 cover of *Time'*s Canadian edition. On May 1, 2005, the band performed at the Coachella Valley Music & Arts Festival.[24] In May 2005, the band signed a short-term publishing contract with EMI for *Funeral*, and in June the band released a new single, \"Cold Wind\", on *Six Feet Under, Vol. 2: Everything Ends*. The BBC used the track \"Wake Up\" on an advertisement for their autumn 2005 season, and the tracks \"Rebellion (Lies)\" and \"Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels)\" on adverts in January 2006. On September 9, 2005, the band appeared on the British/US television special \"Fashion Rocks\", on which David Bowie joined them for \"Wake Up\". This recording, as well as recordings of the band's collaboration on Bowie's \"Life on Mars\" and \"Five Years\", were made available on the iTunes Music Store in a virtual live EP. The same trip to New York City took them to the *Late Show with David Letterman* and a concert in Central Park. The Central Park show featured a surprise appearance by Bowie. On September 11, 2005, Arcade Fire appeared on the long-running BBC music series *Top of the Pops*, performing \"Rebellion (Lies)\". The band also performed to a TV audience in Paris for Canal+, and the show was later screened on the British television's Channel 4. The band scored two number one songs on MTV2 (UK) *NME* Chart Show, with \"Neighborhood #3 (Power Out)\" and a three-week run with \"Wake Up\". This success followed Rough Trade Records's last-minute decision to release \"Wake Up\" only on 7\"\nvinyl.[25]\n\n\n\"Wake Up\" was played immediately before the Irish rock group U2 started their concerts on their 2005–06 Vertigo Tour; Arcade Fire subsequently opened three shows for that tour, and at the third in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, appeared on stage during U2's encore to join in a cover of Joy Division's \"Love Will Tear Us Apart\".[26] Additionally, *The Dan Patrick Show*, a daily national sports talk show in the US, plays the song as a lead-out every Friday to signify the end of their show. The song was also heard numerous times during the Super Bowl telecast on February 5, 2010.\n\n\n*Funeral* and the single \"Cold Wind\" were nominated for Grammys in the Best Alternative Rock Album and Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media categories (*Six Feet Under, Vol. 2: Everything Ends*), respectively. On April 2, 2006, in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Arcade Fire received the Juno Award for Songwriters Of The Year for three songs from *Funeral*: \"Wake Up\", \"Rebellion (Lies)\", and \"Neighborhood #3 (Power Out)\".[27] The band was nominated for three BRIT Awards: Best International Group, Best International Album, and Best International Breakthrough Act.[28]\n\n\nArcade Fire made an appearance on the BBC show *Later with Jools Holland* on May 12, 2005, performing \"Power Out\" and \"Rebellion (Lies)\". On December 27, 2005, *Funeral* was ranked No.1 on MTV2's \"50 Greatest Albums of the Year\" in the United Kingdom.[*citation needed*] On October 22, 2007, *Funeral* was ranked No.8 in Bob Mersereau's book *The Top 100 Canadian Albums*.[29] In late 2009, Pitchfork ranked the album No.2 in their list of the top 200 albums of the 2000s, behind Radiohead's *Kid A*.[30]\n\n\n\n### 2006–2010: *Neon Bible*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Neon Bible\n\n![](image)Arcade Fire performing in support of *Neon Bible* at the United Palace Theater on May 7, 2007\nDuring the downtime between *Funeral* and the beginning of recording sessions for *Neon Bible*, the band purchased a defunct church in the small Quebec town of Farnham, approximately 70 kilometres (43 mi) southeast of Montreal, and spent the early part of 2006 converting it into a recording studio.[31]\n\n\nThe first track officially released from *Neon Bible* was \"Intervention\" in December 2006 on iTunes. Proceeds from this release were dedicated to Partners in Health.[32] An error resulted in a second song, \"Black Wave/Bad Vibrations\", appearing on iTunes for a short time. The album was leaked to peer-to-peer networks on January 26, 2007, and was officially released March 5, 2007 in the UK and March 6 in North America. *Neon Bible* premiered at number 1 on the Canadian Albums Chart and the Irish Album Charts, and number 2 on the US *Billboard* Top 200 charts and the UK Top 40 Album Chart for the week of March 12, 2007.[33] The album was also number 1 on the Rock and Indie album charts. The first proper single, \"Black Mirror\", reached the No. 1 spot on CBC Radio 3's *R3-30* chart for five consecutive weeks, from March 22 to April 19, 2007, and was the first single by any band ever to spend more than two weeks atop the chart. The album gained much critical acclaim (even being mooted as a strong contender for album of the year), and because of its success saw the band proclaimed the most exciting act on the earth by British music magazine *Q*. *Paste* voted it one of the five best albums of 2007.[34] *Trouser Press* writer Jason Reeher ranked *Neon Bible* \"among the best indie rock recordings of all time\".[35]\n\n\nArcade Fire made their first appearance on *Saturday Night Live* on February 24, 2007 (Episode 618), performing \"Intervention\" and \"Keep the Car Running\".[36] Owen Pallett was not present as he was recording for his solo project. During the performance, one of Win Butler's guitar strings broke, prompting him to rip the strings from his acoustic guitar and smash it on the floor until it shattered. On this guitar, \"sak vide pa kanpe\" was written in duct tape across the front. A Haitian proverb meaning \"An empty sack cannot stand up\" in Creole, this may have been a reference to the extreme poverty of Haiti, the country of origin of Régine Chassagne.[37]\n\n\n\n![](image)Arcade Fire in July 2007\nOn July 10, 2007, *Neon Bible* was named to the shortlist for the 2007 Polaris Music Prize. Patrick Watson was announced as the winner at a gala ceremony on September 24, 2007.[38][39][40] However, due to the band's preference not to participate in compilation albums, they were the only nominee not to have a track on the Polaris promotional compilation 2007 Polaris Music Prize. Some media initially reported that the Polaris committee had snubbed the band by excluding them, leading the band and the committee to issue a joint press release confirming that the band chose not to have a track included on the album.[41]\n\n\nThe *Neon Bible* tour continued into September 2007 with 25+ dates scheduled in North America and Europe through mid-November. In Paris the band did a Take-Away Show video session shot by Vincent Moon.[42] The band toured Australia and New Zealand for the first time in early 2008 as part of the 2008 Big Day Out festival. On October 14, 2007, Win Butler and Régine Chassagne made a surprise guest appearance at a Bruce Springsteen show in Ottawa, playing \"State Trooper\" and \"Keep the Car Running\".[43] The band committed to give Partners in Health $1.00, £1.00, or €1.00 of every ticket sold on its 2008 European and North American tours.[44]\n\n\nArcade Fire further helped PIH, when it recorded \"Lenin\" on Red Hot Organization's latest album, *Dark Was the Night*. Sales from DWTN generated over $850,000 in money donated to AIDS related charities—$300,000 of which was given to PIH on Arcade Fire's behalf.\n\n\nIn February 2008, Win Butler announced on the band's journal that the *Neon Bible* tour had come to an end, after one year of touring and a total of 122 shows (including 33 festivals) in 75 cities and 19 countries.[45]\nCritics met the self-produced *Neon Bible* with acclaim. Publications like *NME* and *IGN* praised the album for its grandiose nature.[46][47]\n\n\nWin Butler has been a vocal supporter of Barack Obama since the end of the New Hampshire Primary.[48] Arcade Fire performed two free concerts for Obama in Cleveland and Nelsonville, Ohio on March 2, 2008 and March 3, 2008 before the state's March 4 primary.[49][50] The band, with Superchunk, performed another two free concerts for Obama on May 1 in Greensboro, North Carolina, and on May 2 in Carrboro, North Carolina before the state's May 6 primary.[51] On January 21, 2009, Arcade Fire and Jay-Z were the musical guests at the Obama Campaign Staff Ball at the DC Armory, at Obama's request. Butler thanked President Obama for his stated intent to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay, and repeatedly thanked the Obama staffers for their work during the election.\n\n\nThe band was rumoured to be working with producer Markus Dravs on the soundtrack for the Richard Kelly film *The Box*.[52] Win Butler denied the claims, but stated that he and Owen Pallett \"may do an instrumental piece or two\" for the film.[53]\n\n\nIn December 2008, *Pitchfork* reported the band set up the website miroir-noir.com to foreshadow the release of a concert film with the same title, reporting, \"Miroir Noir will feature live footage from the Neon Bible tour.\" The film was directed by Vincent Morisset.[54] It was made available to pre-order on December 15, 2008 with the digital version available to download immediately, and the DVD shipping March 31, 2009.[55][56]\n\n\nA re-recorded version of the band's song \"Wake Up\" from their 2004 debut album, *Funeral*, was used for the trailer of the Spike Jonze film *Where the Wild Things Are*, which was released in October 2009.[57] The song \"Wake Up\" has also become popular on sports radio talk shows in the US In 2009, two nationally syndicated shows—*The Dan Patrick Show* and *The Petros and Money Show*—frequently used the song as \"bumper\" music. The National Football League featured this recording in commercials throughout the broadcast of the 2010 Super Bowl. The band donated the proceeds from licensing the song to the NFL to the charity Partners In Health.[58]\n\n\n\n### 2010–2012: *The Suburbs*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: The Suburbs (Arcade Fire album)\n\nOn May 27, 2010, it was announced that a new double-sided 12\" single would be released the same day as the full album, called *The Suburbs*, on August 2 in the UK and on August 3 in the US and Canada.[59] The album is produced by Markus Dravs, who had worked with the band on their previous album, 2007's *Neon Bible,* and was engineered by Marcus Paquin, who has also previously worked with the band.[60] A track-by-track review ahead of *The Suburbs* release by The Quietus website said, \"The progression is similar to the one William Blake takes us through in *Songs of Innocence and of Experience* that suggests forward momentum and maturity.\"[61] The album was released with eight different covers.[62]\n\n\nThe first show announced was Oxegen 2010 which took place in Ireland in July.[63] The band announced that they would play songs from the new album in their headline performance at the Reading and Leeds Festivals in August 2010, with Win Butler noting, \"We're really looking forward to playing the new songs live... [it's] like an inventor emerging from his basement after a year's work.\"[64]\n\n\n\n![](image)Arcade Fire performing at Madison Square Garden in August 2010\nIn July 2010, Arcade Fire announced they would be broadcasting their August 5 concert at Madison Square Garden live via YouTube. They later announced the video would be directed by Terry Gilliam.[65] *The Suburbs* was released worldwide at the start of August 2010 to extensive critical acclaim comparable to *Funeral* and *Neon Bible*.[66] During the 2010 tour, Arcade Fire gave a tribute to Jay Reatard performing the cover of \"Oh, It's Such a Shame\". Win Butler confessed to Zane Lowe that the band wanted Jay Reatard to support the band on this tour, but he had died. *The Suburbs* went on to debut at number one in the US (on the Billboard 200), selling 156,000 units in its first week. It was also number one in the UK and Canada.\n\n\nIn August 2010, Arcade Fire and Google released an interactive music video, written and directed by Chris Milk and produced by B-Reel, which allows the viewer to enter the address where they grew up and the video is then \"geopersonalised\". This video utilizes the band's song \"We Used to Wait\" from *The Suburbs*, and showcases capabilities of HTML5 and Google's Chrome browser. On November 13, 2010, Arcade Fire made their second appearance on *Saturday Night Live*, performing \"We Used to Wait\" and \"Sprawl II (Mountains Beyond Mountains)\".[67]\n\n\nThe album debuted at No. 1 on the Irish Albums Chart, the UK Albums Chart, the US *Billboard* 200 chart,[68] and the Canadian Albums Chart.[69] It won Album of the Year at the 2011 Grammy Awards, Best International Album at the 2011 BRIT Awards, Album of the Year at the 2011 Juno Awards, and the 2011 Polaris Music Prize for best Canadian album. Two weeks after winning Grammy's Album of the Year, the album jumped from No. 52 to No. 12 on the *Billboard* 200, the album's highest ranking since August 2010.[70]\n\n\nIn a nod to the Butlers' maternal grandfather, Alvino Rey, who was an amateur radio operator, the logo used by the band from this time was a variation of that used by the American Radio Relay League. Also, when playing the single \"We Used to Wait\" live, the background video screen features a radio exchange between Rey and a Canadian operator having Call Sign VE3YV. The video also features many other amateur radio artifacts.\n\n\nArcade Fire performed at the 53rd Grammy Awards in February 2011. The band was nominated for Grammy Awards in three categories: Album of the Year, Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, and Best Alternative Music Album (for *The Suburbs*).[71] Out of the three nominations, they won the Grammy for Album of the Year, their second time to be nominated for the award.[72][73][74]\n\n\nAt the 2011 BRIT Awards, *The Suburbs* won Best International Album, and Arcade Fire won the Award for Best International Group.[75]\n\n\nIn March 2011, Arcade Fire was honoured at the Juno Awards of 2011. They won Group of the Year and Songwriter of the Year for \"Ready to Start\", \"Sprawl II (Mountains Beyond Mountains)\", and \"We Used to Wait\", all off *The Suburbs*. *The Suburbs* also won Album of the Year and Alternative Album of the Year.[76]\n\n\nOn April 19, 2011, it was announced that Arcade Fire would release a deluxe edition of their album *The Suburbs* featuring the short film *Scenes from the Suburbs*, by director Spike Jonze, as well as two new tracks, \"Culture War\" and \"Speaking in Tongues\" featuring David Byrne.[77] *Scenes from the Suburbs*, which debuted at the Berlin International Film Festival 2011, has a running time of 30 minutes.[78] The film screened at the SXSW Film Festival 2011 and saw its online premiere on MUBI on June 27, 2011.[79] Writing for the Canadian Press, Nick Patch called the film \"a sci-fi puzzler that seems to blend the paranoia of Terry Gilliam films with the nostalgia of classic Steven Spielberg flicks.\"[80]\n\n\nOn June 16, the album was named as a longlisted nominee (one of 40) for the 2011 Polaris Music Prize.[81] On July 6, the album was named as a shortlisted (one of 10) nominee for the 2011 award. On September 20, 2011, they were awarded the Polaris Prize.\n\n\nOn May 19, 2012, Arcade Fire (minus members Will and Tim) made their third appearance on *Saturday Night Live*, playing as a backup band for musical guest and host Mick Jagger. The band performed \"The Last Time\" with Jagger, and participated in Kristen Wiig's farewell skit, playing \"She's a Rainbow\" into \"Ruby Tuesday\". The band wore *carrés rouges* (red squares) to show support for the 2012 Quebec student protests.[82]\n\n\nArcade Fire recorded a song for *The Hunger Games* soundtrack (*The Hunger Games: Songs from District 12 and Beyond*), called \"Abraham's Daughter\". The song is featured in the movie's end credits. The soundtrack was released on March 20, 2012, debuting at number one on the *Billboard* 200.[83][84] It sold more than 175,000 copies in its first week according to Nielsen SoundScan. It's the first theatrical film soundtrack to top the chart since Michael Jackson's \"This Is It\" debuted at No. 1 on the list. It is also only the 16th soundtrack to debut at No. 1 in the history of the Billboard 200 chart (those soundtracks include film, television, and straight-to-video efforts).[83]\n\n\nArcade Fire also contributed to the movie's original score, *The Hunger Games: Original Motion Picture Score*. The group composed the grand, fascistic-inspired, ominous Panem national anthem, entitled \"Horn of Plenty\", an important and signature leitmotif appearing throughout the film.[85][86] \"We were interested in making music that would be more integral in the movie, just as a mental exercise,\" Butler, who co-wrote the song with Chassagne, explained. \"And there's an anthem that runs throughout the books, the national anthem of the fascist Capitol. So as a thought experiment, we tried to write what that might sound like. It's like the Capitol's idea of itself, basically.\"[85][86] He further added that \"it's not a pop song or anything. More of an anthem that could be playing at a big sporting event like the [Hunger] Games. So we did a structure for that, and then James Newton Howard made a movie-score version of it that happens in several places in the film.\"[85][86] Arcade Fire's Panem national anthem has received strong reviews. According to *Spin Mobile*, \"'Horn of Plenty' sounds both exactly like Arcade Fire and exactly like a futuristic anthem.\"[87]\n\n\n\n### 2013–2015: *Reflektor*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Reflektor\n\n> \n> \"There's a lot of them, and they're mostly self-produced – like, they don't need a producer in a certain way.

They ended the Mother's Day performance with Win Butler stating “A woman’s right to choose forever and ever and ever, amen.”[139]\n\n\nOn August 27, 2022, Win Butler was accused by four people of several instances of sexual misconduct between 2016 and 2020, including sexual assault, unwanted explicit texts, and pursuing relationships with younger, fans ranging in age from 18 to 23.[140] Butler and Chassagne denied the allegations and said all the encounters had been consensual.[141] A few days later, Canadian artist Feist announced that she and her band would be dropping out as the opening act of Arcade Fire's European tour due to the allegations, having donated proceeds from the two shows she had already played to a local women's aid organization in Dublin.[142] Beck also dropped out as the opening act of Arcade Fire's American tour later that year.[143]\n\n\nIn November 2022, Arcade Fire were announced as headliners for the 2023 editions of the Kalorama festival in Lisbon and the Cala Mijas festival in Málaga.[144][145] In April 2023, Arcade Fire were added to Pharrell Williams' curated festival Something in the Water, held in Virginia Beach.[146] In June 2023, Arcade Fire was announced as a Friday headliner for Mexico City's Corona Capital festival in November.[147]\n\n\n\n## Activism[edit]\n\n\n### Haiti[edit]\n\n\nBecause Régine Chassagne is of Haitian descent, Arcade Fire continuously works to support Haitian people through raising awareness of the struggles this country currently faces, as well as the history, specifically the regime of François Duvalier in which 30,000 to 60,000 Haitians were murdered.[148] This time in history is highlighted in Arcade Fire's song \"Haiti\".\n\n\n\n* 2004: Arcade Fire played two shows in the hometown of Haiti where all profits were donated to Albert Schweitzer's hospital in Haiti.[149]\n* 2005–present: Arcade Fire has donated $1.00, £1.00, or €1.00 of every ticket sold on tour to Partners in Health + Kanpe, via Plus1.[150]\n* 2006: Proceeds from the release of track \"Intervention\" were dedicated to Partners in Health.[32]\n* 2009: Arcade Fire recorded \"Lenin\" for Red Hot Organization's \"Dark Was the Night\". $850,000 raised for AIDS relief; $300,000 was donated to Partners in Health.\n* 2010: The NFL purchased rights to \"Wake Up\" for Super Bowl XLIV; all proceeds went to Partners in Health.[58]\n* AF ♥ Haiti campaign: trained 50k+ volunteers to engage fans in Partners in Health's mission.[151]\n\n\n## Members[edit]\n\n\n* ![Win Butler](image)\n\nWin Butler\n* ![Régine Chassagne](image)\n\nRégine Chassagne\n* ![Richard Reed Parry](image)\n\nRichard Reed Parry\n* ![Tim Kingsbury](image)\n\nTim Kingsbury\n* ![Jeremy Gara](image)\n\nJeremy Gara\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Current members**\n* Win Butler – lead and backing vocals, guitar, piano, keyboards, bass guitar, mandolin (2001–present)\n* Régine Chassagne – backing and lead vocals, accordion, piano, keyboards, hurdy gurdy, recorder, drums, percussion (2001–present)\n* Richard Reed Parry – guitar, bass guitar, double bass, piano, keyboards, synthesizers, organ, celesta, accordion, drums, percussion, backing vocals (2003–present)\n* Tim Kingsbury – bass guitar, guitar, double bass, keyboards, backing vocals (2003–present)\n* Jeremy Gara – drums, percussion, guitar, keyboards (2004–present)\n\n**Current touring musicians**\n* Sarah Neufeld – violin, piano, keyboards, synthesizers, tambourine, xylophone, backing vocals (touring member 2013–present;

He co-founded the Montreal-based indie rock band Arcade Fire with Josh Deu and his wife Régine Chassagne.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nButler was born in Truckee, California, and raised in The Woodlands, Texas, with a Mormon upbringing.[4][5][6] He lived in Buenos Aires, Argentina, before his brother Will was born.[7]\n\n\nHis father, Edwin Farnham Butler II, worked as a geologist for oil conglomerate Halliburton in Houston, Texas.[8] His mother, Liza Rey, who performed on the family TV show, *The King Family Show*, plays jazz harp and sings. Butler's parents currently live on Mount Desert Island, Maine.[9] Butler's maternal grandfather was jazz steel guitarist Alvino Rey, a pioneer bandleader whose career spanned eight decades.[10] His maternal grandmother, Luise, was a member of The King Sisters, who starred in a weekly variety program on ABC called *The King Family Show*.\n\n\nAt the age of 15, Butler started attending the Phillips Exeter Academy preparatory school in New Hampshire, where he lived in Abbot Hall.[11] After graduation, he studied photography and creative writing at Sarah Lawrence College, but left after a year.\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nButler moved to Montreal, Quebec, Canada in 2000 to attend McGill University, where he met his future wife, Régine Chassagne,[12] whom he married in 2003.[13] Butler graduated from McGill in 2004 with a bachelor's degree in religious studies.[14][15]\n\n\nButler participated in the 2005 UNICEF benefit project, \"Do They Know It's Hallowe'en?,\" along with Chassagne. The two also collaborated on the music for the Richard Kelly film *The Box*.[16]\n\n\nOn April 2, 2011, LCD Soundsystem played its last concert before its disbandment. Arcade Fire performed with them during the song \"North American Scum.\" During James Murphy's stumbling introduction to the song, Butler shouted out \"shut up and play the hits!\" Murphy immediately responded, \"ladies and gentlemen, for our live record entitled 'Shut Up and Play the Hits'\" and Butler's cry later became the title of the documentary of the concert.[17]\nIn September 2011, Butler played in a charity basketball tournament in Toronto, Ontario, known as \"Rock The Court.\" Several other celebrities and athletes participated, such as Matt Bonner of the San Antonio Spurs.[18]\n\n\nButler also works as a DJ using the stage name Windows 98. Sometimes he works under this moniker as the opening act for Arcade Fire itself.[1][19]\n\n\nIn March 2015, Butler and Chassagne attended the launch of music streaming service Tidal, and revealed themselves, along with other notable artists, as shareholders in the company.[20]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nButler is married to fellow Arcade Fire member Régine Chassagne, who gave birth to the couple's only child, a son, in 2013.[21]\n\n\nButler was naturalized as a Canadian citizen on July 9, 2019, in a ceremony held in Montreal and hosted by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada minister Ahmed Hussen.[22]\n\n\nButler is a frequent participant in the NBA All-Star Celebrity Game, and won the game's Most Valuable Player award in 2016.[23]\n\n\n\n### Sexual misconduct allegations[edit]\n\n\nAccording to a *Pitchfork* article published on August 27, 2022, four individuals have accused Butler of sexual misconduct, with some saying he initially contacted them on social media.[24] Butler said all contact with the accusers was consensual, and he denies all allegations of misconduct. In a statement to Pitchfork, a representative for Butler acknowledged he had sexual interactions with each of them, but said they were not initiated by him and were consensual. Chassagne corroborated his statements.[25]\n\n\nOn November 22, 2022, *Pitchfork* published a follow-up article detailing Butler's manipulative interactions towards a fifth person. These interactions were described by the individual as \"Emotionally abusive, manipulative, toxic, and using his power dynamic to exploit my body at times that were convenient for him.\"[26]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Yoshida, Emily (March 19, 2015). \"Arcade Fire's Win Butler is DJing at SXSW under the name DJ Windows 98, and this is what that's like\". *The Verge*.

She is married to co-founder Win Butler.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and career[edit]\n\n\nRégine Alexandra Chassagne was born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, and grew up in St-Lambert, a suburb south of Montreal.[2][3] Her parents, who were Haitians of mixed French and African descent, moved from Haiti during the dictatorship of François Duvalier, which is alluded to in the Arcade Fire song \"Haïti\", in which she sings, **Mes cousins jamais nés hantent les nuits de Duvalier** (\"My unborn cousins haunt Duvalier's nights\").[4] The line is in reference to the relatives who were killed during the Jérémie Vespers massacre.\n\n\nChassagne attended *Collège Jean-de-Brébeuf* before earning a B.A. in communication studies at Concordia University[5] in 1998,[6] and went on to study jazz voice briefly at McGill University.[7] She was singing jazz at an art opening at Concordia in 2000, when Win Butler met her and persuaded her to join his band. They married in 2003. Ten years later, their son was born on 21 April 2013.[8][9]\n\n\nChassagne has also been involved with a medieval-themed band called *Les Jongleurs de la Mandragore*[10] and with Jimmy Rouleau in the jazz duo Azúcar.[11] She also wrote the music for the two-minute David Uloth short film \"The Shine\", and she contributed to the UNICEF benefit project as part of the North American Hallowe'en Prevention Initiative, performing the song \"Do They Know It's Hallowe'en?\" along with Win Butler.\n\n\nShe plays many instruments on stage, including accordion, drums, xylophone, hurdy-gurdy, keyboards, organ and guitar. In Arcade Fire, Chassagne performs lead vocals on some songs, including \"Haiti\", \"In the Backseat\", \"Black Wave/Bad Vibrations\", \"Empty Room\", \"Abraham's Daughter\", \"Sprawl II (Mountains Beyond Mountains)\", \"Creature Comfort\", \"Electric Blue\", and \"Unconditional II (Race and Religion)\".\n\n\nIn March 2015, Chassagne, along with Win Butler, attended the launch of music streaming service Tidal, and revealed themselves, along with other notable artists, as shareholders in the company.[12]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nChassagne has been married to fellow Arcade Fire member Win Butler since 2003. They had a son in April 2013.[13]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Hoard, Christian (10 March 2005). \"The Fire This Time\". *Rolling Stone*. No. 969. pp. 59–60.

His late father was David Parry of the folk band Friends of Fiddler's Green. His mother, Caroline Balderston Parry, was a poet and musician, and his sister, Evalyn Parry, is a theatre artist, songwriter, and spoken word performer.[2][3] Parry's family is Quaker and Parry grew up attending Toronto Monthly Meeting.[4][5]\n\n\nParry attended Canterbury High School in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada and was one of a dozen members of the Literary Arts program (first generation). His classmates include *Stargate: Atlantis* writer Martin Gero and *The Holmes Show* comedian Kurt Smeaton.\n\n\nIn the mid 1990s, he worked summers at a vegetarian camp in near Chelsea, Quebec, called *Camp Au Grand Bois*.\n\n\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, he studied electroacoustics and contemporary dance at Concordia University in Montreal.\n\n\nThe Bell Orchestre was formed in 2005, along with Sarah Neufeld, Tim Kingsbury as well as Stefan Schneider and French horn player Pietro Amato. Parry primarily plays double bass and is the de facto producer.[6][7] Bell Orchestre released *As Seen Through Windows* with Arts & Crafts Records on March 10, 2009.[8] It was recorded with John Mcentire in Soma Electric Studios in Chicago, Illinois. The album since won a 2011 Juno Award for best instrumental album.\n\n\nA long-time core member of Arcade Fire, he co-produced and collaborated on the debut EP, *Arcade Fire*, before the first lineup of the band fell apart. Helping to reform and recreate the band, Parry brought in Bell Orchestre bandmate Sarah Neufeld, and New International Standards bandmates, Tim Kingsbury and Jeremy Gara.\n\n\nHe has also made musical contributions to albums by The National, Little Scream, Sufjan Stevens, The Unicorns and Islands. On the latter's critically acclaimed 2006 album Return to the Sea, he played several instruments, sang background vocals and arranged strings, and appeared with the band's 2016 10-year-anniversary shows where they played the album in full.\nParry has also performed in a cover band called Phi Slamma Jamma along with Arcade Fire bandmates Will Butler, Jeremy Gara, and Tim Kingsbury. The group performed at the 2011 POP Montreal Festival as well as the 2012 Crossing Brooklyn Ferry Festival.\n\n\nOn January 20, 2007, Parry returned to Canterbury High to perform a concert with Arcade Fire in the school's cafeteria. Only 400 students and staff were permitted to attend the show. Beforehand, those chosen had the opportunity to preview new, unreleased songs from the Arcade Fire's upcoming album. After the show, there was a brief autograph period and the students met with the band members.[9]\n\n\nHe was also formerly a member of the band the New International Standards, with Tim Kingsbury and Jeremy Gara.[5] His first work for Orchestra, entitled *For Heart, Breath and Orchestra.* It was recorded by the Kitchener-Waterloo Symphony, on their 2011 album *From Here on Out* alongside pieces by Jonny Greenwood and Nico Muhly. He has also written commissioned works for Kronos Quartet, yMusic and Bryce Dessner, and his chamber works also have been performed by the Calder Quartet and Warhol Dervish.\nParry appeared at each night of the 2012 All Tomorrow's Parties festival, mounting a \"moving surround sound sci-fi composition for bicycles and boomboxes\" entitled *Drones/Revelations*, as well as performing songs with a folk trio called *Quiet River of Dust*, and as part of a chamber music ensemble performing Parry's *Music for Heart and Breath*. The lineup included Owen Pallett, Nico Muhly, Bryce Dessner, Aaron Dessner, Gaspar Claus, Nadia Sirota, Kyle Resnick, and Dave Nelson.\nHe occasionally performs as drummer and backup singer with Little Scream.[10]\n\n\nParry has also collaborated with The National, arranging vocals and writing guitar parts for their songs on their 2010 album *High Violet* and appeared with them singing and playing guitar and double bass in their Vevo live event as well as on their Late Night with David Letterman appearance in 2011. He has joined them frequently onstage as a guest during many performances, including Lollapalooza 2010 (at which Arcade Fire also performed) and also during a brief segment of Arcade Fire's 2011 midwestern US tour in which The National acted as openers. Parry has also collaborated with Bryce Dessner of The National on classical compositions, performing together at the Edinburgh Festival in 2015.[2]\n\n\nParry recently co-hosted a BBC 6 Music Takeover programme with the members of The National called Arcade Fire and the National Takeover\n[11] Parry and brothers Aaron & Bryce Dessner who play guitar in The National have been long-term friends since meeting on the American alt-rock circuit, regularly appearing on the same festival bills worldwide.\n[11] Their friendship was cemented when Richard from the Arcade Fire contributed to a number of songs on The National's album High Violet, most notably playing double bass and guitar on 'Vanderlyle Crybaby Geeks', and doing the vocal harmony arrangements on 'Conversation 16' and 'Sorrow'. During this show Parry mentioned he was producing an album by a local Montreal artist named Little Scream.\n\n\nIn July 2018 Parry announced the upcoming release of two albums: *Quiet River Of Dust Vol. 1* and *Quiet River Of Dust Vol. 2*.[12] The albums are inspired by Buddhist myths, death poems, British folk songs, and a recent trip to Japan.[12]\n\n\nBetween 2019 and 2021, Richard Reed Parry produced The Sadies' 2022 album *Colder Streams* at Montréal's Skybarn.[13] This was the last album by The Sadies to feature founding member Dallas Good, who died suddenly of natural causes on February 17, 2022, at the age of 48.[14] Shortly after, Parry announced via Instagram that he and Dallas had been working on an album on and off since 2008 with the working title The Watchtower. Unfinished at the time of Dallas Good's death, Parry plans to finish the album.[15]\n\n\n\n## Discography[edit]\n\n\n### Solo works[edit]\n\n\n* *Master Mix: Red Hot + Arthur Russell* (2 tracks on compilation LP), (Yep Roc, 2012)\n* *From Here on Out* Kitchener-Waterloo Symphony, (LP, Analekta, 2012)\n* *Spirit of Talk Talk*, (track on compilation LP, Fierce Panda, 2012)\n* *Have Not Been the Same*, (track on compilation LP, Zunior, 2012)\n* *Music For Heart and Breath* Kronos Quartet, yMusic, Bryce and Aaron Dessner, Nadia Sirota, (LP, Deutsche Grammophon, 2014)\n* *Quiet River of Dust* (LP, Secret City Records, 2018)\n* *Quiet River of Dust Vol. 2: That Side of the River* (LP, ANTI-/Secret City Records, 2019)[16]\n* *The Nest* (soundtrack LP, 2020)[17]\n\n\n### Arcade Fire[edit]\n\n\n* *Arcade Fire* (EP, Merge, 2003)\n* *Funeral* (LP, Merge, 2004)\n* *Neon Bible* (LP, Merge, 2007)\n* *The Suburbs* (LP, Merge, 2010)\n* *Reflektor* (LP, Merge, 2013)\n* *Everything Now* (LP, Sonovox, 2017)\n* *We* (LP, Sonovox, 2022)\n\n\n### Bell Orchestre[edit]\n\n\n* *Bell Orchestre*, (demo, 2002)\n* *Recording a Tape the Colour of the Light*, (album, 2005)\n* *As Seen Through Windows*, (LP, released on March 10, 2009)\n* *Who Designs Nature's How*, (EP, released on August 25, 2009)\n\n\n### Little Scream[edit]\n\n\n* *The Golden Record*, (LP, Secretly Canadian, 2011)\n\n\n### The National[edit]\n\n\n* *Trouble Will Find Me*, (LP, 4AD, 2013)\n* *High Violet*, (LP, 4AD, 2010)\n\n\n### Barr Brothers[edit]\n\n\n* *Sleeping Operator*, (LP, Secret City Records, 2014)\n\n\n### Islands[edit]\n\n\n* *Return to the Sea*, (LP, Rough Trade, 2007)\n\n\n### The Unicorns[edit]\n\n\n* *Who Will Cut Our Hair When We're Gone?*, (LP, Rough Trade, 2004)\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Jeremy Gara and Richard Reed Parry of Arcade Fire.

Unfinished at the time of Dallas Good's death, Parry plans to finish the album.[15]\n\n\n\n## Discography[edit]\n\n\n### Solo works[edit]\n\n\n* *Master Mix: Red Hot + Arthur Russell* (2 tracks on compilation LP), (Yep Roc, 2012)\n* *From Here on Out* Kitchener-Waterloo Symphony, (LP, Analekta, 2012)\n* *Spirit of Talk Talk*, (track on compilation LP, Fierce Panda, 2012)\n* *Have Not Been the Same*, (track on compilation LP, Zunior, 2012)\n* *Music For Heart and Breath* Kronos Quartet, yMusic, Bryce and Aaron Dessner, Nadia Sirota, (LP, Deutsche Grammophon, 2014)\n* *Quiet River of Dust* (LP, Secret City Records, 2018)\n* *Quiet River of Dust Vol. 2: That Side of the River* (LP, ANTI-/Secret City Records, 2019)[16]\n* *The Nest* (soundtrack LP, 2020)[17]\n\n\n### Arcade Fire[edit]\n\n\n* *Arcade Fire* (EP, Merge, 2003)\n* *Funeral* (LP, Merge, 2004)\n* *Neon Bible* (LP, Merge, 2007)\n* *The Suburbs* (LP, Merge, 2010)\n* *Reflektor* (LP, Merge, 2013)\n* *Everything Now* (LP, Sonovox, 2017)\n* *We* (LP, Sonovox, 2022)\n\n\n### Bell Orchestre[edit]\n\n\n* *Bell Orchestre*, (demo, 2002)\n* *Recording a Tape the Colour of the Light*, (album, 2005)\n* *As Seen Through Windows*, (LP, released on March 10, 2009)\n* *Who Designs Nature's How*, (EP, released on August 25, 2009)\n\n\n### Little Scream[edit]\n\n\n* *The Golden Record*, (LP, Secretly Canadian, 2011)\n\n\n### The National[edit]\n\n\n* *Trouble Will Find Me*, (LP, 4AD, 2013)\n* *High Violet*, (LP, 4AD, 2010)\n\n\n### Barr Brothers[edit]\n\n\n* *Sleeping Operator*, (LP, Secret City Records, 2014)\n\n\n### Islands[edit]\n\n\n* *Return to the Sea*, (LP, Rough Trade, 2007)\n\n\n### The Unicorns[edit]\n\n\n* *Who Will Cut Our Hair When We're Gone?*, (LP, Rough Trade, 2004)\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Jeremy Gara and Richard Reed Parry of Arcade Fire.

He plays bass guitar, guitar, and occasionally keyboards.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nKingsbury spent his early years living in and around Guelph, Ontario.[1] He comes from a musical family; his mother Birdie was a pianist and a music director and Parkwood Gardens Community church in Guelph, and Kingsbury sang in the church choir.[2] His brother Brett is a professional classical pianist. After piano lessons as a child, Kingsbury stopped playing music until a friend of his mother gave him a guitar when he was fourteen. He began to teach himself to play and write music.[3] Kingsbury attended John F. Ross in Guelph[4] where he began playing in bands when he was sixteen.[3] Christian rock was an early influence for Kingsbury,[2] especially the music of pioneering American Christian rock artist Larry Norman.[3] Kingsbury cites his later influences as Pavement and Palace and Dinosaur Jr.[3] He played with Gentleman Reg while in high school, only playing one show outside of Guelph.[5]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nAfter high school, Kingsbury moved to Ottawa where he played with a number of bands such as the Killers and Geoffrey Pye, before joining Clark the band. While in Ottawa he met Jeremy Gara. The two played together in a band in Ottawa and would later move to Montreal and play together in The New International Standards, Arcade Fire and Kingsbury's solo project, Sam Patch.[6]\n\n\nKingsbury moved to Montreal in 2001.[7] Kingsbury had a hard time finding full-time work with a band and made ends meet by working as a telemarketer for a pharmaceutical company.[4] At the same time, he played in a number of bands, including the New International Standards.[5] The New International Standards included Richard Reed Parry, Annesley Black and Mike Feuerstack. The band was active for about two years. It was Parry that brought Kingsbury into Arcade Fire.[5]\n\n\n\n### Arcade Fire[edit]\n\n\nKingsbury began to play with Arcade Fire in 2003 after the break-up of the band's original membership.[8] Although Kingsbury primarily plays bass in Arcade Fire, he also plays guitar and sings.[7]\n\n\nGuelph continues to be a contact for Kingsbury and the fellow members of Arcade Fire. Arcade Fire performed at Guelph’s Hillside Festival in 2005, a performance Sam Baijal, artistic director of Hillside, credits with giving the Festival a huge boost in popularity.[4]\n\n\n\n### Other projects[edit]\n\n\nKingsbury also toured and recorded with Montreal band Wolf Parade as a bassist, appearing on the album the 2005 album *Apologies to the Queen Mary*.[9] He has also been involved with the bands Clark and The New International Standards in addition to recording as a solo artist.[10]\n\n\n\n### Sam Patch[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2015 he launched a side project under the name \"Sam Patch\" along with fellow Arcade Fire member Jeremy Gara and Toronto artist Basia Bulat.[11] He played his first show as Sam Patch at Montreal's *Bar Le Ritz*.[12] Kingsbury began writing music while on tour with Arcade Fire and recorded the album *Yeah You, and I* post-tour, with Gara, Bulat. John McEntire of the bands Sea and Cake, and Tortoise and fellow Tortoise member Doug McCombs also appear.[13] Kingsbury named the project after an early 19th-century daredevil by the same name. Sam Patch, also known as the Jersey Jumper, would jump from bridges, buildings and other heights, including the Niagara River at the base of the Falls. Patch met his death in 1829 attempting a stunt at Rochester's High Falls.[6]\n\n\nKingsbury recorded the song \"In to Trouble\" for the film 2020 film *Pieces of a Woman*, and in 2021 released the song as a digital single.[14]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Record, The. \"'To us, he'll always just be Tim'\". *www.therecord.com*.

He has also been involved in the bands Clark, Snailhouse (with fellow Arcade Fire member Sarah Neufeld) and The New International Standards (with Arcade Fire members Richard Reed Parry and Tim Kingsbury). He recently played percussion on Owen Pallett's *Heartland* album (Pallett being a former member and regular contributor to Arcade Fire).[6]\n\n\nAs with other members of Arcade Fire, during live performances he often swaps instruments with other members of the band between songs, often taking on the role of an extra guitarist on certain songs.\n\n\nOn 14 January 2016, Jeremy Gara announced he would release debut solo record 'Limn' on 11 March 2016 sharing the video for album track 'Divinity'.[2] The album is a primarily composed of improvisation and is accompanied by artwork created by Gara.[2] Reviewers have noted it fits in with the Montreal electronic scene and potentially has little crossover appeal.[4]\n\n\nGara has also occasionally filled in on drums on the television program Late Night with Seth Meyers.[7]\n\n\n\n## Discography[edit]\n\n\nKepler\n* 2000: *Fuck Fight Fail* (Troubleman Unlimited)\n* 2002: *Missionless Days* (Resonant Records)\n* 2005: *Attic Salt* (Troubleman Unlimited)[8]\n\n\nArcade Fire\n* 2007: *Neon Bible* (Merge Records)\n* 2010: *The Suburbs* (City Slang)\n* 2013: *Reflektor* (Sonovox Records)[9]\n* 2017: *Everything Now* (Sonovox Records)\n* 2022: *We* (Sonovox Records)\n\n\nArizona Amp and Alternator\n* 2005: *Arizona Amp and Alternator* (AAAA)\n\n\nSusanna Wallumrød\n* 2012: *Wild Dog* (Sonovox Records)[10]\n\n\nMarnie Stern\n* 2023 : *The Comeback Kid* (Joyful Noise Records)[11]\n\n\nSolo release\n* 2016: *Limn* (NRCSS Industry)\n* 2020: *Passerine Finale* (Invada Records)\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Canada portal\n* ![](image)Music portal\n\n\n1. **^** \"Jeremy Gara Discography\".
