It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the 1895 will of Alfred Nobel, who died in 1896. These prizes are awarded for outstanding contributions in chemistry, physics, literature, peace, and physiology or medicine.[1] As dictated by Nobel's will, the award is administered by the Nobel Foundation and awarded by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.[2] The first Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded in 1901 to Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff, of the Netherlands. Each recipient receives a medal, a diploma and a monetary award prize that has varied throughout the years.[3] In 1901, van 't Hoff received 150,782 SEK, which is equal to 7,731,004 SEK in December 2007. The award is presented in Stockholm at an annual ceremony on 10 December, the anniversary of Nobel's death.[4]\n\n\nAt least 25 laureates have received the Nobel Prize for contributions in the field of organic chemistry, more than any other field of chemistry.[5] Two Nobel Prize laureates in Chemistry, Germans Richard Kuhn (1938) and Adolf Butenandt (1939), were not allowed by their government to accept the prize. They would later receive a medal and diploma, but not the money. Frederick Sanger is one out of three laureates to be awarded the Nobel Prize twice in the same subject, in 1958 and 1980. John Bardeen, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1956 and 1972, and Karl Barry Sharpless, who won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 2001 and 2022, are the others. Two others have won Nobel Prizes twice, one in chemistry and one in another subject: Maria Sk\u0142odowska-Curie (physics in 1903, chemistry in 1911) and Linus Pauling (chemistry in 1954, peace in 1962).[6] As of 2022, the prize has been awarded to 189 individuals, including eight women (Maria Sk\u0142odowska-Curie being the first to be awarded in 1911).[7]\n\n\nThere have been eight years for which the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was not awarded (1916, 1917, 1919, 1924, 1933, 1940\u201342). There were also nine years for which the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was delayed for one year. The Prize was not awarded in 1914, as the Nobel Committee for Chemistry decided that none of that year's nominations met the necessary criteria, but was awarded to Theodore William Richards in 1915 and counted as the 1914 prize.[8] This precedent was followed for the 1918 prize awarded to Fritz Haber in 1919,[9] the 1920 prize awarded to Walther Nernst in 1921,[10] the 1921 prize awarded to Frederick Soddy in 1922,[11] the 1925 prize awarded to Richard Zsigmondy in 1926,[12] the 1927 prize awarded to Heinrich Otto Wieland in 1928,[13] the 1938 prize awarded to Richard Kuhn in 1939,[14] the 1943 prize awarded to George de Hevesy in 1944,[15] and the 1944 prize awarded to Otto Hahn in 1945.[16]\n\n\nIn 2020, Ioannidis et al. reported that half of the Nobel Prizes for science awarded between 1995 and 2017 were clustered in just a few disciplines within their broader fields. Atomic physics, particle physics, cell biology, and neuroscience dominated the two subjects outside chemistry, while molecular chemistry was the chief prize-winning discipline in its domain. Molecular chemists won 5.3% of all science Nobel Prizes during this period.[17]\n\n\n\n\n## Laureates[edit]\n\n\n* 1901\n* 1910\n* 1920\n* 1930\n* 1940\n* 1950\n* 1960\n* 1970\n* 1980\n* 1990\n*

according to Alfred Nobel's will of 1895, are awarded to \"those who, during the preceding year, have conferred the greatest benefit to Mankind.\" Additionally, the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel was established by Sveriges Riksbank in 1968 and awarded to a \"person or persons in the field of economic sciences who have produced work of outstanding importance.\"\n\n\nAs of 2023, 65 Nobel Prizes and the Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences have been awarded to 64 women.[1][3] Unique Nobel Prize laureates include 894 men, 60 women, and 27 organizations.[4]\n\n\nThe distribution of Nobel prizes awarded to women is as follows:\n\n\n\n* nineteen women have won the Nobel Peace Prize (16.3% of 110 awarded);[5]\n* seventeen have won the Nobel Prize in Literature (14.28% of 119 awarded);[6]\n* thirteen have won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (5.6% of 230 awarded);[7]\n* eight have won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry (4.1% of 191 awarded);[8]\n* five have won the Nobel Prize in Physics (1.8% of 224 awarded);[9]\n* and three (Elinor Ostrom, Esther Duflo and Claudia Goldin) have won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences (2.17% of 92 awarded).[10]\n\n\nThe first woman to win a Nobel Prize was Marie Curie, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903 with her husband, Pierre Curie, and Henri Becquerel.[11][12] Curie is also the first person and the only woman to have won multiple Nobel Prizes; in 1911, she won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Curie's daughter, Ir\u00e8ne Joliot-Curie, won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1935, making the two the only mother\u2013daughter pair to have won Nobel Prizes.[11]\n\n\nThe most Nobel Prizes awarded to women in a single year was in 2009, when five women became laureates in four categories.\n\n\nThe most recent women to be awarded a Nobel Prize were Claudia Goldin in Economics, Narges Mohammadi for Peace, Anne L'Huillier in Physics and Katalin Karik\u00f3 in Physiology or Medicine (2023), Annie Ernaux in Literature and Carolyn R. Bertozzi for Chemistry (2022), Maria Ressa for Peace (2021), Louise Gl\u00fcck in Literature, Andrea M. Ghez in Physics, Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer A. Doudna in Chemistry (2020), and Esther Duflo in Economics (2019).\n\n\n\n\n## Female laureates[edit]\n\n\n* Physiology or Medicine\n* Physics\n* Chemistry\n* Literature\n* Peace\n* Economic Sciences\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Physiology or Medicine** |\n| No.\n | Year\n | Laureate\n | Name\n | Born\n | Died\n | Rationale\n |\n| 1\n | 1947\n | ![](image) | Gerty Radnitz-Cori | 15 August 1896 Prague, ![](image)\u00a0Austria-Hungary | 26 October 1957 Glendale, Missouri, ![](image)\u00a0United States | \"\"for their discovery of the course of the catalytic conversion of glycogen.\"[13](shared with Carl Ferdinand Cori and Bernardo Houssay) |\n| 2\n | 1977\n | ![](image) | Rosalyn Yalow | 19 July 1921 New York City, New York, ![](image)\u00a0United States | 30 May 2011 The Bronx, New York, ![](image)\u00a0United States | \"for the development of radioimmunoassays of peptide hormones.\"[14](shared with Roger Guillemin and Andrew Schally) |\n| 3\n | 1983\n | ![](image) | Barbara McClintock | 16 June 1902 Hartford, Connecticut, ![](image)\u00a0United States | 2 September 1992 Huntington, New York, ![](image)\u00a0United States | \"for her discovery of mobile genetic elements.\"[15] |\n| 4\n | 1986\n | ![](image) | Rita Levi-Montalcini | 22 April 1909 Turin, ![](image)\u00a0Italy | 30 December 2012 Rome, ![](image)\u00a0Italy | \"for their discoveries of growth factors.\"[16](shared with Stanley Cohen) |\n| 5\n | 1988\n | ![](image) | Gertrude Belle Elion | 23 January 1918 New York City, New York, ![](image)\u00a0United States | 21 February 1999 Chapel Hill, North Carolina, ![](image)\u00a0United States | \"for their discoveries of important principles for drug treatment.\"[17](shared with James W.
