federal republic located primarily in North America, composed of 50 states, five major self-governing territories, several island possessions, and the federal district and national capital of Washington, D.C., where most of the federal government is based.\n\n\nThe U.S. federal government, sometimes simply referred to as \"Washington\", is composed of three distinct branches: legislative, executive, and judicial, whose powers are vested by the U.S. Constitution in the Congress, the president, and the federal courts, respectively. The powers and duties of these branches are further defined by acts of Congress, including the creation of executive departments and courts subordinate to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n\n\n\n## Naming[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A diagram of the political system of the United States\nThe full name of the republic is \"United States of America\". No other name appears in the Constitution, and this is the name that appears on money, in treaties, and in legal cases to which the nation is a party. The terms \"Government of the United States of America\" or \"United States Government\" are often used in official documents to represent the federal government as distinct from the states collectively. \n\n\nIn casual conversation or writing, the term \"Federal Government\" is often used, and the term \"National Government\" is sometimes used. The terms \"Federal\" and \"National\" in government agency or program names generally indicate affiliation with the federal government; for instance, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and National Park Service. Because the seat of government is in Washington, D.C., \"Washington\" is sometimes used as a metonym for the federal government.\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the United States government\n\nThe United States government is based on the principles of federalism and republicanism, in which power is shared between the national government and state governments. The interpretation and execution of these principles, including what powers the federal government should have and how those powers can be exercised, have been debated ever since the adoption of the Constitution. Some make a case for expansive federal powers while others argue for a more limited role for the central government in relation to individuals, the states, or other recognized entities.\n\n\nSince the American Civil War, the powers of the federal government have generally expanded greatly, although there have been periods since that time of legislative branch dominance (e.g., the decades immediately following the Civil War) or when states' rights proponents have succeeded in limiting federal power through legislative action, executive prerogative or by a constitutional interpretation by the courts.[2][3]\n\n\nOne of the theoretical pillars of the U.S. Constitution is the idea of \"checks and balances\" among the powers and responsibilities of the three branches of American government: the executive, the legislative, and the judiciary. For example, while the legislative branch (Congress) has the power to create law, the executive branch under the president can veto any legislation—an act which, in turn, can be overridden by Congress.[4] The president nominates judges to the nation's highest judiciary authority, the Supreme Court, but those nominees must be approved by Congress. The Supreme Court, in turn, can invalidate unconstitutional laws passed by the Congress. These and other examples are examined in more detail in the text below.\n\n\n\n## Legislative branch[edit]\n\n\nMain article: United States Congress\n\n![](image)Seal of the United States Congress\nThe United States Congress, under Article I of the Constitution, is the legislative branch of the federal government. It is bicameral, comprising the House of Representatives and the Senate.\n\n\n\n### Makeup of Congress[edit]\n\n\n#### House of Representatives[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The 435 seats of the U.S. House of Representatives grouped by state\nThe U.S. House of Representatives is made up of 435 voting members, each of whom represents a congressional district in a state from where they were elected. Apportionment of seats among the 50 states is determined by state populations, and it is updated after each decennial U.S. Census. Each member serves a two-year term. \n\n\nIn order to be elected as a representative, an individual must be at least 25 years of age, must have been a U.S. citizen for at least seven years, and must live in the state that they represent. \n\n\nIn addition to the 435 voting members, there are six non-voting members, consisting of five delegates and one resident commissioner. There is one delegate each from Washington, D.C., Guam, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and a resident commissioner from Puerto Rico.[5]\n\n\nUnlike the U.S. Senate, all members of the U.S. House must be elected and cannot be appointed. In the case of a vacancy, the seat must be filled through a special election, as required under Article 1 of the U.S. Constitution.[6]\n\n\n\n#### Senate[edit]\n\n\nIn contrast, the Senate is made up of two senators from each state, regardless of population. There are currently 100 senators (2 from each of the 50 states), who each serve six-year terms. Approximately one-third of the Senate stands for election every two years.\n\n\nIf a vacancy occurs, the state governor appoints a replacement to complete the term or to hold the office until a special election can take place.[7]\n\n\n\n#### Separate powers[edit]\n\n\nThe House and Senate each have particular exclusive powers. For example, the Senate must approve (give \"advice and consent\" to) many important presidential appointments, including cabinet officers, federal judges (including nominees to the Supreme Court), department secretaries (heads of federal executive branch departments), U.S. military and naval officers, and ambassadors to foreign countries. All legislative bills for raising revenue must originate in the House of Representatives. The approval of both chambers is required to pass all legislation, which then may only become law by being signed by the president (or, if the president vetoes the bill, both houses of Congress then re-pass the bill, but by a two-thirds majority of each chamber, in which case the bill becomes law without the president's signature). The powers of Congress are limited to those enumerated in the Constitution; all other powers are reserved to the states and the people. \n\n\nThe Constitution also includes the Necessary and Proper Clause, which grants Congress the power to \"make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers\". Members of the House and Senate are elected by first-past-the-post voting in every state except Louisiana and Georgia, which have runoffs, and Maine and Alaska, which use ranked-choice voting.\n\n\n\n#### Impeachment of federal officers[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Federal impeachment in the United States\n\nCongress has the power to remove the president, federal judges, and other federal officers from office. The House of Representatives and Senate have separate roles in this process. The House must first vote to impeach the official. Then, a trial is held in the Senate to decide whether the official should be removed from office. As of 2023[update], three presidents have been impeached: Andrew Johnson, Bill Clinton, and Donald Trump (twice). None of the three were removed from office following trial in the Senate.[8]\n\n\n\n#### Congressional procedures[edit]\n\n\nArticle I, Section 2, paragraph 2 of the U.S. Constitution gives each chamber the power to \"determine the rules of its proceedings\". From this provision were created congressional committees, which do the work of drafting legislation and conducting congressional investigations into national matters. The 108th Congress (2003–2005) had 19 standing committees in the House and 17 in the Senate, plus 4 joint permanent committees with members from both houses overseeing the Library of Congress, printing, taxation, and the economy. In addition, each house may name special, or select, committees to study specific problems. Today, much of the congressional workload is borne by the subcommittees, of which there are around 150.\n\n\n\n### Powers of Congress[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Article One of the United States Constitution\n\n![](image)The United States Capitol, the seat of government for Congress, the legislative branch of the U.S. government\nThe Constitution grants numerous powers to Congress. Enumerated in Article I, Section 8, these include the powers to levy and collect taxes; to coin money and regulate its value; provide for punishment for counterfeiting; establish post offices and roads, issue patents, create federal courts inferior to the Supreme Court, combat piracies and felonies, declare war, raise and support armies, provide and maintain a navy, make rules for the regulation of land and naval forces, provide for, arm and discipline the militia, exercise exclusive legislation in the District of Columbia, regulate interstate commerce, and to make laws necessary to properly execute powers. Over the two centuries since the United States was formed, many disputes have arisen over the limits on the powers of the federal government. These disputes have often been the subject of lawsuits that have ultimately been decided by the United States Supreme Court.\n\n\n\n#### Congressional oversight[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Congressional oversight\n\nCongressional oversight is intended to prevent waste and fraud, protect civil liberties and individual rights, ensure executive compliance with the law, gather information for making laws and educating the public, and evaluate executive performance.[9]\n\n\nIt applies to cabinet departments, executive agencies, regulatory commissions, and the presidency.\n\n\nCongress' oversight function takes many forms:\n\n\n\n* Committee inquiries and hearings\n* Formal consultations with and reports from the president\n* Senate advice and consent for presidential nominations and for treaties\n* House impeachment proceedings and subsequent Senate trials\n* House and Senate proceedings under the 25th Amendment if the president becomes disabled or if the office of the vice president falls vacant\n* Informal meetings between legislators and executive officials\n* Congressional membership: each state is allocated a number of seats based on its representation (or ostensible representation, in the case of D.C.) in the House of Representatives. Each state is allocated two senators regardless of its population. As of January 2010[update], the District of Columbia elects a non-voting representative to the House of Representatives along with American Samoa, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Northern Mariana Islands.\n\n\n## Executive branch[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Article Two of the United States Constitution and List of United States federal executive orders\n\n![](image)\nJoe Biden  \n46th president\n![](image)\nKamala Harris  \n49th vice president\nsince January 20, 2021\n\n### President[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: President of the United States and Powers of the president of the United States\n\n![](image)The seal of the president of the United States\n![](image)The White House includes the office of the U.S. president, known as the Oval Office, and the offices of key presidential advisors and staff.\n#### Executive powers and duties[edit]\n\n\nThe executive branch is established in Article Two of the United States Constitution, which vests executive power in the president of the United States.[10][11] The president is both the head of state (performing ceremonial functions) and the head of government (the chief executive).[12] The Constitution directs the president to \"take care that the laws be faithfully executed\"[11] and requires the president to swear or affirm to \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.\"[13] Legal scholars William P. Marshall and Saikrishna B. Prakash write of the Clause: \"the President may neither breach federal law nor order their subordinates to do so, for defiance cannot be considered faithful execution. The Constitution also incorporates the English bars on dispensing or suspending the law, with some supposing that the Clause itself prohibits both.\"[14] Many presidential actions are undertaken via executive orders, presidential proclamations, and presidential memoranda.[15]\n\n\nThe president is the commander-in-chief of the armed forces.[11][16] Under the Reception Clause, the president is empowered to \"receive Ambassadors and other public Ministers\"; the president has broad authority to conduct foreign relations, is generally considered to have the sole power of diplomatic recognition,[11][17] and is the United States' chief diplomat,[17] although the Congress also has an important role in legislating on foreign affairs,[11][17] and can, for example, \"institute a trade embargo, declare war upon a foreign government that the President had recognized, or decline to appropriate funds for an embassy in that country.\"[17] The president may also negotiate and sign treaties, but ratifying treaties requires the consent of two-thirds of the Senate.[18]\n\n\nArticle II's Appointments Clause provides that the president \"shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States\" while providing that \"Congress may by Law vest the Appointment of such inferior Officers, as they think proper, in the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments.\"[19] These appointments delegate \"by legal authority a portion of the sovereign powers of the federal government.\"[20]\n\n\nThe Constitution grants the president the \"Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment\"; this clemency power includes the power to issue absolute or conditional pardons, and to issue commute sentences, to remit fines, and to issue general amnesties.[21] The presidential clemency power extends only to federal crimes, and not to state crimes.[22]\n\n\nThe president has informal powers beyond their formal powers. For example, the president has major agenda-setting powers to influence lawmaking and policymaking,[23] and typically has a major role as the leader of their political party.[24]\n\n\n\n#### Election, succession, and term limits[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: United States presidential election\n\nThe president and vice president are normally elected as running mates by the Electoral College; each state has a number of electoral votes equal to the size of its Congressional delegation (*i.e.*, its number of Representatives in the House plus its two senators). The District of Columbia has a number of electoral votes \"equal to the whole number of Senators and Representatives in Congress to which the District would be entitled if it were a State, but in no event more than the least populous State\".[10][25] A President may also be seated by succession. As originally drafted, there was no limit to the time a President could serve, however the Twenty-second Amendment, ratified in 1951, originally limits any president to serving two four-year terms (8 years); the amendment specifically \"caps the service of a president at 10 years\" by providing that \"if a person succeeds to the office of president without election and serves less than two years, he may run for two full terms; otherwise, a person succeeding to office of president can serve no more than a single elected term.\"[26][27]\n\n\n\n#### Veto power, impeachment, and other issues[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Uncle Sam, a common personification of the U.S. federal government, depicted in an early 20th century illustration\nUnder the Presentment Clause of Article I, a bill that passes both chambers of Congress shall be presented to the president, who may sign the bill into law or veto the bill by returning it to the chamber where it originated.[28] If the president neither signs nor vetoes a bill \"within ten Days (Sundays excepted) after it shall have been presented to him\" it becomes a law without the president's signature, \"unless the Congress by their Adjournment prevent its Return in which Case it shall not be a Law\" (called a pocket veto).[28] A presidential veto may be overridden by a two-thirds vote in both houses of Congress vote to override the veto;[28] this occurs relatively infrequently.[29]\n\n\nThe president may be impeached by a majority in the House and removed from office by a two-thirds majority in the Senate for \"treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors\". \n\n\nThe president may not dissolve Congress, but has the power to adjourn Congress whenever the House and Senate cannot agree when to adjourn; no president has ever used this power.[14] The president also has the constitutional power to, \"on extraordinary Occasions, convene both Houses, or either of them\"; this power has been used \" to consider nominations, war, and emergency legislation.\"[14] This Section invests the President with the discretion to convene Congress on \"extraordinary occasions\"; this special session power that has been used to call the chambers to consider urgent matters.[14]\n\n\n\n### Vice president[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Vice President of the United States\n\n![](image)Seal of the vice president of the United States\nThe vice president is the second-highest official in rank of the federal government. The vice president's duties and powers are established in the legislative branch of the federal government under Article 1, Section 3, Clauses 4 and 5 as the president of the Senate; this means that they are the designated presiding officer of the Senate. In that capacity, the vice president has the authority (*ex officio*, for they are not an elected member of the Senate) to cast a tie-breaking vote. Pursuant to the Twelfth Amendment, the vice president presides over the joint session of Congress when it convenes to count the vote of the Electoral College. As first in the U.S. presidential line of succession, the vice president's duties and powers move to the executive branch when becoming president upon the death, resignation, or removal of the president, which has happened nine times in U.S. history. Lastly, in the case of a Twenty-fifth Amendment succession event, the vice president would become acting president, assuming all of the powers and duties of president, except being designated as president. Accordingly, by circumstances, the Constitution designates the vice president as routinely in the legislative branch, or succeeding to the executive branch as president, or possibly being in both as acting president pursuant to the Twenty-fifth Amendment. Because of circumstances, the overlapping nature of the duties and powers attributed to the office, the title of the office and other matters, such has generated a spirited scholarly dispute regarding attaching an exclusive branch designation to the office of vice president.[30][31]\n\n\n\n### Cabinet, executive departments, and agencies[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Cabinet of the United States, United States federal executive departments, and List of federal agencies in the United States\n\nArticle II, Section 2 of the Constitution sets forth the creation of a presidential Cabinet. The role of the Cabinet is to advise the president and carry out the programs and laws of the federal government. The Cabinet is composed of the vice president and the leaders of 15 executive departments. Those executive departments are the Departments of State, Treasury, Defense, Justice, Interior, Agriculture, Commerce, Labor, Health and Human Services, Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, Energy, Education, Veterans Affairs, and Homeland Security.[32]\n\n\nAdditionally, there are seven other members of the Cabinet who are appointed by the president. These are the White House Chief of Staff, Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, Director of the Office of Management & Budget, United States Trade Representative, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, and Administrator of the Small Business Administration.[33]\n\n\nThe heads of the 15 departments are chosen by the president and approved with the \"advice and consent\" of the U.S. Senate. Once confirmed, these \"Cabinet secretaries\" serve at the pleasure of the president. \n\n\nIn addition to the executive departments, a number of staff organizations are grouped into the Executive Office of the President (EOP), which was created in 1939 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt.[33] The EOP is overseen by the White House Chief of Staff. The EOP includes the White House staff, the National Security Council, the Office of Management and Budget, the Council of Economic Advisers, the Council on Environmental Quality, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, the Office of National Drug Control Policy, and the Office of Science and Technology Policy.\n\n\nOutside of the EOP and the executive departments are a number of independent agencies. These include the United States Postal Service (USPS), NASA, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). In addition, there are government-owned corporations, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the National Railroad Passenger Corporation.\n\n\n\n## Judicial branch[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Federal judiciary of the United States\n\nFurther information: Supreme Court of the United States\n\nSee also: Article Three of the United States Constitution\n\nThe Judiciary, under Article III of the Constitution, explains and applies the laws. This branch does this by hearing and eventually making decisions on various legal cases.\n\n\n\n### Overview of the federal judiciary[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Seal of the U.S. Supreme Court\nArticle III section I of the Constitution establishes the Supreme Court of the United States and authorizes the United States Congress to establish inferior courts as their need shall arise. Section I also establishes a lifetime tenure for all federal judges and states that their compensation may not be diminished during their time in office. Article II section II establishes that all federal judges are to be appointed by the president and confirmed by the United States Senate.\n\n\nThe Judiciary Act of 1789 subdivided the nation jurisdictionally into judicial districts and created federal courts for each district. The three tiered structure of this act established the basic structure of the national judiciary: the Supreme Court, 13 courts of appeals, 94 district courts, and two courts of special jurisdiction. Congress retains the power to re-organize or even abolish federal courts lower than the Supreme Court.\n\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court decides cases and controversies, which include matters pertaining to the federal government, disputes between states, and interpretation of the United States Constitution, and, in general, can declare legislation or executive action made at any level of the government as unconstitutional, nullifying the law and creating precedent for future law and decisions. The United States Constitution does not specifically mention the power of judicial review, which is the power to declare a law unconstitutional. There have been instances in the past where such declarations have been ignored by the other two branches. Below the U.S. Supreme Court are the United States Courts of Appeals, and below them in turn are the United States District Courts, which are the general trial courts for federal law, and for certain controversies between litigants who are not deemed citizens of the same state, known as diversity jurisdiction.\n\n\nThere are three levels of federal courts with general jurisdiction, which are courts that handle both criminal and civil suits between individuals. Other courts, such as the bankruptcy courts and the U.S. Tax Court, are specialized courts handling only certain kinds of cases, known as subject matter jurisdiction. The Bankruptcy Courts are supervised by the district courts, and, as such, are not considered part of the Article III judiciary. As such, their judges do not have lifetime tenure, nor are they Constitutionally exempt from diminution of their remuneration.[34] The Tax Court is an Article I Court, not an Article III Court.[35]\n\n\nThe district courts are the trial courts wherein cases that are considered under the Judicial Code (Title 28, United States Code) consistent with the jurisdictional precepts of federal question jurisdiction, diversity jurisdiction, and pendent jurisdiction can be filed and decided. The district courts can also hear cases under removal jurisdiction, wherein a case brought in a state court meets the requirements for diversity jurisdiction, and one party litigant chooses to \"remove\" the case from state court to federal court.\n\n\nThe United States Courts of Appeals are appellate courts that hear appeals of cases decided by the district courts, and some direct appeals from administrative agencies, and some interlocutory appeals. The U.S. Supreme Court hears appeals from the decisions of the courts of appeals or state supreme courts, and in addition has original jurisdiction over a few cases.\n\n\nThe judicial power extends to cases arising under the Constitution, an Act of Congress; a U.S. treaty; cases affecting ambassadors, ministers and consuls of foreign countries in the U.S.; cases and controversies to which the federal government is a party; controversies between states (or their citizens) and foreign nations (or their citizens or subjects); and bankruptcy cases (collectively \"federal-question jurisdiction\"). The Eleventh Amendment removed from federal jurisdiction cases in which citizens of one state were the plaintiffs and the government of another state was the defendant. It did not disturb federal jurisdiction in cases in which a state government is a plaintiff and a citizen of another state the defendant.\n\n\nThe power of the federal courts extends both to civil actions for damages and other redress, and to criminal cases arising under federal law. The interplay of the Supremacy Clause and Article III has resulted in a complex set of relationships between state and federal courts. Federal courts can sometimes hear cases arising under state law pursuant to diversity jurisdiction, state courts can decide certain matters involving federal law, and a handful of federal claims are primarily reserved by federal statute to the state courts. Both court systems have exclusive jurisdiction in some areas and concurrent jurisdiction in others.\n\n\nThe U.S. Constitution safeguards judicial independence by providing that federal judges shall hold office \"during good behavior\"; in practice, this usually means they serve until they die, retire, or resign. A judge who commits an offense while in office may be impeached in the same way as the president or other officials of the federal government. U.S. judges are appointed by the president, subject to confirmation by the Senate. Another Constitutional provision prohibits Congress from reducing the pay of any present Article III judge. However, Congress is able to set a lower salary for all future judges who take office after such a pay reduction is passed by Congress.\n\n\n\n### Relationships between state and federal courts[edit]\n\n\nSeparate from, but not entirely independent of, this federal court system are the court systems of each state, each dealing with, in addition to federal law when not deemed preempted, a state's own laws, and having its own court rules and procedures. Although state governments and the federal government are legally *dual sovereigns*, the Supreme Court of the United States is in many cases the appellate court from the State Supreme Courts (e.g., absent the Court countenancing the applicability of the *doctrine of adequate and independent State grounds*). The Supreme Courts of each state are by this doctrine the final authority on the interpretation of the applicable state's laws and Constitution. Many state constitution provisions are equal in breadth to those of the U.S. Constitution, but are considered \"parallel\" (thus, where, for example, the right to privacy pursuant to a state constitution is broader than the federal right to privacy, and the asserted ground is explicitly held to be \"independent\", the question can be finally decided in a State Supreme Court—the U.S. Supreme Court will decline to take jurisdiction).\n\n\nA State Supreme Court, other than of its own accord, is bound *only* by the U.S. Supreme Court's interpretation of federal law, but is *not* bound by interpretation of federal law by the federal court of appeals for the federal circuit in which the state is included, or even the federal district courts located in the state, a result of the *dual sovereigns* concept. Conversely, a federal district court hearing a matter involving only a question of state law (usually through diversity jurisdiction) must apply the substantive law of the state in which the court sits, a result of the application of the *Erie Doctrine*; however, at the same time, the case is heard under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and the Federal Rules of Evidence instead of state procedural rules (that is, the application of the *Erie Doctrine* only extends to a requirement that a federal court asserting diversity jurisdiction apply *substantive* state law, but not *procedural* state law, which may be different). Together, the laws of the federal and state governments form U.S. law.\n\n\n\n## Budget[edit]\n\n\nMain article: United States federal budget\n\n![](image)Federal revenue and spending of the U.S. federal government as of 2021\n![](image)The financial ratio of federal debt to federal revenue from 1996 through 2022\nThe budget document often begins with the president's proposal to Congress recommending funding levels for the next fiscal year, beginning October 1 and ending on September 30 of the year following. The fiscal year refers to the year in which it ends.\n\n\nFor fiscal year (FY) 2018, the federal government spent $4.11 trillion. Spending equalled 20.3% of gross domestic product (GDP), equal to the 50-year average.[36] The deficit equaled $779 billion, 3.8 percent of GDP. Tax revenue amounted to $3.33 trillion, with receipt categories including individual income taxes ($1,684B or 51%), Social Security/Social Insurance taxes ($1,171B or 35%), and corporate taxes ($205B or 6%).[36]\n\n\n\n## Employees[edit]\n\n\nMain article: United States federal civil service\n\nThe United States federal government had about 2,096,000 civilian employees in FY2016, with about 173,000 of those in the District of Columbia (not counting the United States Postal Service).[37]\n\n\n\n## Elections and voting[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Elections in the United States\n\n![](image)Diagram of the Federal Government and American Union in 1862\nSuffrage, known as the ability to vote, has changed significantly over time. In the early years of the United States, voting was considered a matter for state governments, and was commonly restricted to white men who owned land. Direct elections were mostly held only for the U.S. House of Representatives and state legislatures, although what specific bodies were elected by the electorate varied from state to state. Under this original system, both senators representing each state in the U.S. Senate were chosen by a majority vote of the state legislature. Since the ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913, members of both houses of Congress have been directly elected. Today, U.S. citizens have almost universal suffrage under equal protection of the laws[38] from the age of 18,[39] regardless of race,[40] gender,[41] or wealth.[42] The only significant exception to this is the disenfranchisement of convicted felons, and in some states former felons as well.\n\n\nUnder the U.S. Constitution, the representation of U.S. territories and the federal district of District of Columbia in Congress is limited: while residents of the District of Columbia are subject to federal laws and federal taxes, their only congressional representative is a non-voting delegate; however, they have participated in presidential elections since March 29, 1961.[43]\n\n\nResidents of Puerto Rico other than federal employees do not pay federal personal income taxes on income that has its source in Puerto Rico,[44][45] and do not pay most federal excise taxes (for example, the federal gasoline tax);[45] however, Puerto Ricans pay all other federal taxes, including the federal payroll taxes that fund Social Security and Medicare; the FUTA tax; and business, gift, and estate taxes.[45][44] Puerto Rico is represented in the Congress by a nonvoting Resident Commissioner, a nonvoting delegate.[46]\n\n\n\n## State, tribal, and local governments[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: State governments of the United States, Tribal sovereignty in the United States, and Local government in the United States\n\n![United States](image)The states of the United States as divided into counties (or, in Louisiana and Alaska, parishes and boroughs, respectively). Alaska and Hawaii are not to scale and the Aleutian and uninhabited Northwestern Hawaiian Islands have been omitted.\nState governments have the greatest influence over most Americans' daily lives. The Tenth Amendment prohibits the federal government from exercising any power not delegated to it by the Constitution; as a result, states handle the majority of issues most relevant to individuals within their jurisdiction. Because state governments are not authorized to print currency, they generally have to raise revenue through either taxes or bonds. As a result, state governments tend to impose severe budget cuts or raise taxes any time the economy is faltering.[47]\n\n\nEach state has its own written constitution, government and code of laws. The Constitution stipulates only that each state must have, \"a Republican Government\". Therefore, there are often great differences in law and procedure between individual states, concerning issues such as property, crime, health and education, amongst others. The highest elected official of each state is the Governor, with below him being the Lieutenant Governor. Each state also has an elected state legislature (bicameralism is a feature of every state except Nebraska), whose members represent the voters of the state. Each state maintains its own state court system. In some states, supreme and lower court justices are elected by the people; in others, they are appointed, as they are in the federal system.\n\n\nAs a result of the Supreme Court case *Worcester v. Georgia*, American Indian tribes are considered \"domestic dependent nations\" that operate as sovereign governments subject to federal authority but, in some cases, outside of the jurisdiction of state governments. Hundreds of laws, executive orders and court cases have modified the governmental status of tribes vis-à-vis individual states, but the two have continued to be recognized as separate bodies. Tribal governments vary in robustness, from a simple council used to manage all aspects of tribal affairs, to large and complex bureaucracies with several branches of government. Tribes are currently encouraged to form their own governments, with power resting in elected tribal councils, elected tribal chairpersons, or religiously appointed leaders (as is the case with pueblos). Tribal citizenship and voting rights are typically restricted to individuals of native descent, but tribes are free to set whatever citizenship requirements they wish.\n\n\nThe institutions that are responsible for local government within states are typically counties, municipalities, and special-purpose districts, which make laws that affect their particular area. These laws concern issues such as traffic, the sale of alcohol and the keeping of animals. A county is an administrative or political subdivision of a state, while Louisiana and Alaska have county-equivalent subdivisions called parishes and boroughs, respectively. The specific governmental powers of counties vary widely between the states, with those in Connecticut, Rhode Island, and some parts of Alaska and Massachusetts having little or no power, existing only as geographic distinctions. In other areas, county governments have more power, such as to collect taxes and maintain law enforcement agencies. Twenty states further divide their counties into civil townships. Population centers may be organized into incorporated municipalities of several types, including the city, town, borough, and village. These municipal entities also vary from state to state, and typically subordinate to the government of a county or civil township. However, many rural and suburban regions are in unincorporated areas that have no municipal government below the county or civil township level. Certain cities have consolidated with their county government to form consolidated city-counties, or have been legally separated from counties altogether to form independent cities. States may also create special-purpose districts that perform a single function or a set of related functions within an area inside one or more counties or municipalities, like school districts, water management districts, fire management districts, and library districts.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| President[edit]* Executive Office\n* Line-item veto\n\nCourts[edit]* District courts\n* Federal courts\n* Federal judicial circuit\n | Law[edit]* U.S. Code\n\nAgencies[edit]* Federal agencies\n | * ![flag](image)United States portal\n* ![icon](image)Politics portal\n\nStates and territories[edit]* Political divisions\n* U.S. territory\n\nWorks and websites[edit]* Business.gov\n* Copyright status of work by the U.S. government\n* USA.gov\n\n\n |\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The U.S. Government Publishing Office specifies the capitalization of *Federal Government*, in regards to the national government of the United States, as a proper noun.[1]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"3\" (PDF). *U.S. Government Publishing Office Style Manual* (2016 ed.).

Politics portal\n |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\nThe **federal government of the United States** (**U.S. federal government** or **U.S. government**)[a] is the national government of the United States, a federal republic located primarily in North America, composed of 50 states, five major self-governing territories, several island possessions, and the federal district and national capital of Washington, D.C., where most of the federal government is based.\n\n\nThe U.S. federal government, sometimes simply referred to as \"Washington\", is composed of three distinct branches: legislative, executive, and judicial, whose powers are vested by the U.S. Constitution in the Congress, the president, and the federal courts, respectively. The powers and duties of these branches are further defined by acts of Congress, including the creation of executive departments and courts subordinate to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n\n\n\n## Naming[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A diagram of the political system of the United States\nThe full name of the republic is \"United States of America\". No other name appears in the Constitution, and this is the name that appears on money, in treaties, and in legal cases to which the nation is a party. The terms \"Government of the United States of America\" or \"United States Government\" are often used in official documents to represent the federal government as distinct from the states collectively. \n\n\nIn casual conversation or writing, the term \"Federal Government\" is often used, and the term \"National Government\" is sometimes used. The terms \"Federal\" and \"National\" in government agency or program names generally indicate affiliation with the federal government; for instance, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and National Park Service. Because the seat of government is in Washington, D.C., \"Washington\" is sometimes used as a metonym for the federal government.\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the United States government\n\nThe United States government is based on the principles of federalism and republicanism, in which power is shared between the national government and state governments. The interpretation and execution of these principles, including what powers the federal government should have and how those powers can be exercised, have been debated ever since the adoption of the Constitution. Some make a case for expansive federal powers while others argue for a more limited role for the central government in relation to individuals, the states, or other recognized entities.\n\n\nSince the American Civil War, the powers of the federal government have generally expanded greatly, although there have been periods since that time of legislative branch dominance (e.g., the decades immediately following the Civil War) or when states' rights proponents have succeeded in limiting federal power through legislative action, executive prerogative or by a constitutional interpretation by the courts.[2][3]\n\n\nOne of the theoretical pillars of the U.S. Constitution is the idea of \"checks and balances\" among the powers and responsibilities of the three branches of American government: the executive, the legislative, and the judiciary. For example, while the legislative branch (Congress) has the power to create law, the executive branch under the president can veto any legislation—an act which, in turn, can be overridden by Congress.[4] The president nominates judges to the nation's highest judiciary authority, the Supreme Court, but those nominees must be approved by Congress. The Supreme Court, in turn, can invalidate unconstitutional laws passed by the Congress. These and other examples are examined in more detail in the text below.\n\n\n\n## Legislative branch[edit]\n\n\nMain article: United States Congress\n\n![](image)Seal of the United States Congress\nThe United States Congress, under Article I of the Constitution, is the legislative branch of the federal government. It is bicameral, comprising the House of Representatives and the Senate.\n\n\n\n### Makeup of Congress[edit]\n\n\n#### House of Representatives[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The 435 seats of the U.S. House of Representatives grouped by state\nThe U.S. House of Representatives is made up of 435 voting members, each of whom represents a congressional district in a state from where they were elected. Apportionment of seats among the 50 states is determined by state populations, and it is updated after each decennial U.S. Census. Each member serves a two-year term. \n\n\nIn order to be elected as a representative, an individual must be at least 25 years of age, must have been a U.S. citizen for at least seven years, and must live in the state that they represent. \n\n\nIn addition to the 435 voting members, there are six non-voting members, consisting of five delegates and one resident commissioner. There is one delegate each from Washington, D.C., Guam, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and a resident commissioner from Puerto Rico.[5]\n\n\nUnlike the U.S. Senate, all members of the U.S. House must be elected and cannot be appointed. In the case of a vacancy, the seat must be filled through a special election, as required under Article 1 of the U.S. Constitution.[6]\n\n\n\n#### Senate[edit]\n\n\nIn contrast, the Senate is made up of two senators from each state, regardless of population. There are currently 100 senators (2 from each of the 50 states), who each serve six-year terms. Approximately one-third of the Senate stands for election every two years.\n\n\nIf a vacancy occurs, the state governor appoints a replacement to complete the term or to hold the office until a special election can take place.[7]\n\n\n\n#### Separate powers[edit]\n\n\nThe House and Senate each have particular exclusive powers. For example, the Senate must approve (give \"advice and consent\" to) many important presidential appointments, including cabinet officers, federal judges (including nominees to the Supreme Court), department secretaries (heads of federal executive branch departments), U.S. military and naval officers, and ambassadors to foreign countries. All legislative bills for raising revenue must originate in the House of Representatives. The approval of both chambers is required to pass all legislation, which then may only become law by being signed by the president (or, if the president vetoes the bill, both houses of Congress then re-pass the bill, but by a two-thirds majority of each chamber, in which case the bill becomes law without the president's signature). The powers of Congress are limited to those enumerated in the Constitution; all other powers are reserved to the states and the people. \n\n\nThe Constitution also includes the Necessary and Proper Clause, which grants Congress the power to \"make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers\". Members of the House and Senate are elected by first-past-the-post voting in every state except Louisiana and Georgia, which have runoffs, and Maine and Alaska, which use ranked-choice voting.\n\n\n\n#### Impeachment of federal officers[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Federal impeachment in the United States\n\nCongress has the power to remove the president, federal judges, and other federal officers from office. The House of Representatives and Senate have separate roles in this process. The House must first vote to impeach the official. Then, a trial is held in the Senate to decide whether the official should be removed from office. As of 2023[update], three presidents have been impeached: Andrew Johnson, Bill Clinton, and Donald Trump (twice). None of the three were removed from office following trial in the Senate.[8]\n\n\n\n#### Congressional procedures[edit]\n\n\nArticle I, Section 2, paragraph 2 of the U.S. Constitution gives each chamber the power to \"determine the rules of its proceedings\". From this provision were created congressional committees, which do the work of drafting legislation and conducting congressional investigations into national matters. The 108th Congress (2003–2005) had 19 standing committees in the House and 17 in the Senate, plus 4 joint permanent committees with members from both houses overseeing the Library of Congress, printing, taxation, and the economy. In addition, each house may name special, or select, committees to study specific problems. Today, much of the congressional workload is borne by the subcommittees, of which there are around 150.\n\n\n\n### Powers of Congress[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Article One of the United States Constitution\n\n![](image)The United States Capitol, the seat of government for Congress, the legislative branch of the U.S. government\nThe Constitution grants numerous powers to Congress. Enumerated in Article I, Section 8, these include the powers to levy and collect taxes; to coin money and regulate its value; provide for punishment for counterfeiting; establish post offices and roads, issue patents, create federal courts inferior to the Supreme Court, combat piracies and felonies, declare war, raise and support armies, provide and maintain a navy, make rules for the regulation of land and naval forces, provide for, arm and discipline the militia, exercise exclusive legislation in the District of Columbia, regulate interstate commerce, and to make laws necessary to properly execute powers. Over the two centuries since the United States was formed, many disputes have arisen over the limits on the powers of the federal government. These disputes have often been the subject of lawsuits that have ultimately been decided by the United States Supreme Court.\n\n\n\n#### Congressional oversight[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Congressional oversight\n\nCongressional oversight is intended to prevent waste and fraud, protect civil liberties and individual rights, ensure executive compliance with the law, gather information for making laws and educating the public, and evaluate executive performance.[9]\n\n\nIt applies to cabinet departments, executive agencies, regulatory commissions, and the presidency.\n\n\nCongress' oversight function takes many forms:\n\n\n\n* Committee inquiries and hearings\n* Formal consultations with and reports from the president\n* Senate advice and consent for presidential nominations and for treaties\n* House impeachment proceedings and subsequent Senate trials\n* House and Senate proceedings under the 25th Amendment if the president becomes disabled or if the office of the vice president falls vacant\n* Informal meetings between legislators and executive officials\n* Congressional membership: each state is allocated a number of seats based on its representation (or ostensible representation, in the case of D.C.) in the House of Representatives. Each state is allocated two senators regardless of its population. As of January 2010[update], the District of Columbia elects a non-voting representative to the House of Representatives along with American Samoa, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Northern Mariana Islands.\n\n\n## Executive branch[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Article Two of the United States Constitution and List of United States federal executive orders\n\n![](image)\nJoe Biden  \n46th president\n![](image)\nKamala Harris  \n49th vice president\nsince January 20, 2021\n\n### President[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: President of the United States and Powers of the president of the United States\n\n![](image)The seal of the president of the United States\n![](image)The White House includes the office of the U.S. president, known as the Oval Office, and the offices of key presidential advisors and staff.\n#### Executive powers and duties[edit]\n\n\nThe executive branch is established in Article Two of the United States Constitution, which vests executive power in the president of the United States.[10][11] The president is both the head of state (performing ceremonial functions) and the head of government (the chief executive).[12] The Constitution directs the president to \"take care that the laws be faithfully executed\"[11] and requires the president to swear or affirm to \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.\"[13] Legal scholars William P. Marshall and Saikrishna B. Prakash write of the Clause: \"the President may neither breach federal law nor order their subordinates to do so, for defiance cannot be considered faithful execution. The Constitution also incorporates the English bars on dispensing or suspending the law, with some supposing that the Clause itself prohibits both.\"[14] Many presidential actions are undertaken via executive orders, presidential proclamations, and presidential memoranda.[15]\n\n\nThe president is the commander-in-chief of the armed forces.[11][16] Under the Reception Clause, the president is empowered to \"receive Ambassadors and other public Ministers\"; the president has broad authority to conduct foreign relations, is generally considered to have the sole power of diplomatic recognition,[11][17] and is the United States' chief diplomat,[17] although the Congress also has an important role in legislating on foreign affairs,[11][17] and can, for example, \"institute a trade embargo, declare war upon a foreign government that the President had recognized, or decline to appropriate funds for an embassy in that country.\"[17] The president may also negotiate and sign treaties, but ratifying treaties requires the consent of two-thirds of the Senate.[18]\n\n\nArticle II's Appointments Clause provides that the president \"shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States\" while providing that \"Congress may by Law vest the Appointment of such inferior Officers, as they think proper, in the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments.\"[19] These appointments delegate \"by legal authority a portion of the sovereign powers of the federal government.\"[20]\n\n\nThe Constitution grants the president the \"Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment\"; this clemency power includes the power to issue absolute or conditional pardons, and to issue commute sentences, to remit fines, and to issue general amnesties.[21] The presidential clemency power extends only to federal crimes, and not to state crimes.[22]\n\n\nThe president has informal powers beyond their formal powers. For example, the president has major agenda-setting powers to influence lawmaking and policymaking,[23] and typically has a major role as the leader of their political party.[24]\n\n\n\n#### Election, succession, and term limits[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: United States presidential election\n\nThe president and vice president are normally elected as running mates by the Electoral College; each state has a number of electoral votes equal to the size of its Congressional delegation (*i.e.*, its number of Representatives in the House plus its two senators). The District of Columbia has a number of electoral votes \"equal to the whole number of Senators and Representatives in Congress to which the District would be entitled if it were a State, but in no event more than the least populous State\".[10][25] A President may also be seated by succession. As originally drafted, there was no limit to the time a President could serve, however the Twenty-second Amendment, ratified in 1951, originally limits any president to serving two four-year terms (8 years); the amendment specifically \"caps the service of a president at 10 years\" by providing that \"if a person succeeds to the office of president without election and serves less than two years, he may run for two full terms; otherwise, a person succeeding to office of president can serve no more than a single elected term.\"[26][27]\n\n\n\n#### Veto power, impeachment, and other issues[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Uncle Sam, a common personification of the U.S. federal government, depicted in an early 20th century illustration\nUnder the Presentment Clause of Article I, a bill that passes both chambers of Congress shall be presented to the president, who may sign the bill into law or veto the bill by returning it to the chamber where it originated.[28] If the president neither signs nor vetoes a bill \"within ten Days (Sundays excepted) after it shall have been presented to him\" it becomes a law without the president's signature, \"unless the Congress by their Adjournment prevent its Return in which Case it shall not be a Law\" (called a pocket veto).[28] A presidential veto may be overridden by a two-thirds vote in both houses of Congress vote to override the veto;[28] this occurs relatively infrequently.[29]\n\n\nThe president may be impeached by a majority in the House and removed from office by a two-thirds majority in the Senate for \"treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors\". \n\n\nThe president may not dissolve Congress, but has the power to adjourn Congress whenever the House and Senate cannot agree when to adjourn; no president has ever used this power.[14] The president also has the constitutional power to, \"on extraordinary Occasions, convene both Houses, or either of them\"; this power has been used \" to consider nominations, war, and emergency legislation.\"[14] This Section invests the President with the discretion to convene Congress on \"extraordinary occasions\"; this special session power that has been used to call the chambers to consider urgent matters.[14]\n\n\n\n### Vice president[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Vice President of the United States\n\n![](image)Seal of the vice president of the United States\nThe vice president is the second-highest official in rank of the federal government. The vice president's duties and powers are established in the legislative branch of the federal government under Article 1, Section 3, Clauses 4 and 5 as the president of the Senate; this means that they are the designated presiding officer of the Senate. In that capacity, the vice president has the authority (*ex officio*, for they are not an elected member of the Senate) to cast a tie-breaking vote. Pursuant to the Twelfth Amendment, the vice president presides over the joint session of Congress when it convenes to count the vote of the Electoral College. As first in the U.S. presidential line of succession, the vice president's duties and powers move to the executive branch when becoming president upon the death, resignation, or removal of the president, which has happened nine times in U.S. history. Lastly, in the case of a Twenty-fifth Amendment succession event, the vice president would become acting president, assuming all of the powers and duties of president, except being designated as president. Accordingly, by circumstances, the Constitution designates the vice president as routinely in the legislative branch, or succeeding to the executive branch as president, or possibly being in both as acting president pursuant to the Twenty-fifth Amendment. Because of circumstances, the overlapping nature of the duties and powers attributed to the office, the title of the office and other matters, such has generated a spirited scholarly dispute regarding attaching an exclusive branch designation to the office of vice president.[30][31]\n\n\n\n### Cabinet, executive departments, and agencies[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Cabinet of the United States, United States federal executive departments, and List of federal agencies in the United States\n\nArticle II, Section 2 of the Constitution sets forth the creation of a presidential Cabinet. The role of the Cabinet is to advise the president and carry out the programs and laws of the federal government. The Cabinet is composed of the vice president and the leaders of 15 executive departments. Those executive departments are the Departments of State, Treasury, Defense, Justice, Interior, Agriculture, Commerce, Labor, Health and Human Services, Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, Energy, Education, Veterans Affairs, and Homeland Security.[32]\n\n\nAdditionally, there are seven other members of the Cabinet who are appointed by the president. These are the White House Chief of Staff, Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, Director of the Office of Management & Budget, United States Trade Representative, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, and Administrator of the Small Business Administration.[33]\n\n\nThe heads of the 15 departments are chosen by the president and approved with the \"advice and consent\" of the U.S. Senate. Once confirmed, these \"Cabinet secretaries\" serve at the pleasure of the president. \n\n\nIn addition to the executive departments, a number of staff organizations are grouped into the Executive Office of the President (EOP), which was created in 1939 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt.[33] The EOP is overseen by the White House Chief of Staff. The EOP includes the White House staff, the National Security Council, the Office of Management and Budget, the Council of Economic Advisers, the Council on Environmental Quality, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, the Office of National Drug Control Policy, and the Office of Science and Technology Policy.\n\n\nOutside of the EOP and the executive departments are a number of independent agencies. These include the United States Postal Service (USPS), NASA, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). In addition, there are government-owned corporations, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the National Railroad Passenger Corporation.\n\n\n\n## Judicial branch[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Federal judiciary of the United States\n\nFurther information: Supreme Court of the United States\n\nSee also: Article Three of the United States Constitution\n\nThe Judiciary, under Article III of the Constitution, explains and applies the laws. This branch does this by hearing and eventually making decisions on various legal cases.\n\n\n\n### Overview of the federal judiciary[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Seal of the U.S. Supreme Court\nArticle III section I of the Constitution establishes the Supreme Court of the United States and authorizes the United States Congress to establish inferior courts as their need shall arise. Section I also establishes a lifetime tenure for all federal judges and states that their compensation may not be diminished during their time in office. Article II section II establishes that all federal judges are to be appointed by the president and confirmed by the United States Senate.\n\n\nThe Judiciary Act of 1789 subdivided the nation jurisdictionally into judicial districts and created federal courts for each district. The three tiered structure of this act established the basic structure of the national judiciary: the Supreme Court, 13 courts of appeals, 94 district courts, and two courts of special jurisdiction. Congress retains the power to re-organize or even abolish federal courts lower than the Supreme Court.\n\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court decides cases and controversies, which include matters pertaining to the federal government, disputes between states, and interpretation of the United States Constitution, and, in general, can declare legislation or executive action made at any level of the government as unconstitutional, nullifying the law and creating precedent for future law and decisions. The United States Constitution does not specifically mention the power of judicial review, which is the power to declare a law unconstitutional. There have been instances in the past where such declarations have been ignored by the other two branches. Below the U.S. Supreme Court are the United States Courts of Appeals, and below them in turn are the United States District Courts, which are the general trial courts for federal law, and for certain controversies between litigants who are not deemed citizens of the same state, known as diversity jurisdiction.\n\n\nThere are three levels of federal courts with general jurisdiction, which are courts that handle both criminal and civil suits between individuals. Other courts, such as the bankruptcy courts and the U.S. Tax Court, are specialized courts handling only certain kinds of cases, known as subject matter jurisdiction. The Bankruptcy Courts are supervised by the district courts, and, as such, are not considered part of the Article III judiciary. As such, their judges do not have lifetime tenure, nor are they Constitutionally exempt from diminution of their remuneration.[34] The Tax Court is an Article I Court, not an Article III Court.[35]\n\n\nThe district courts are the trial courts wherein cases that are considered under the Judicial Code (Title 28, United States Code) consistent with the jurisdictional precepts of federal question jurisdiction, diversity jurisdiction, and pendent jurisdiction can be filed and decided. The district courts can also hear cases under removal jurisdiction, wherein a case brought in a state court meets the requirements for diversity jurisdiction, and one party litigant chooses to \"remove\" the case from state court to federal court.\n\n\nThe United States Courts of Appeals are appellate courts that hear appeals of cases decided by the district courts, and some direct appeals from administrative agencies, and some interlocutory appeals. The U.S. Supreme Court hears appeals from the decisions of the courts of appeals or state supreme courts, and in addition has original jurisdiction over a few cases.\n\n\nThe judicial power extends to cases arising under the Constitution, an Act of Congress; a U.S. treaty; cases affecting ambassadors, ministers and consuls of foreign countries in the U.S.; cases and controversies to which the federal government is a party; controversies between states (or their citizens) and foreign nations (or their citizens or subjects); and bankruptcy cases (collectively \"federal-question jurisdiction\"). The Eleventh Amendment removed from federal jurisdiction cases in which citizens of one state were the plaintiffs and the government of another state was the defendant. It did not disturb federal jurisdiction in cases in which a state government is a plaintiff and a citizen of another state the defendant.\n\n\nThe power of the federal courts extends both to civil actions for damages and other redress, and to criminal cases arising under federal law. The interplay of the Supremacy Clause and Article III has resulted in a complex set of relationships between state and federal courts. Federal courts can sometimes hear cases arising under state law pursuant to diversity jurisdiction, state courts can decide certain matters involving federal law, and a handful of federal claims are primarily reserved by federal statute to the state courts. Both court systems have exclusive jurisdiction in some areas and concurrent jurisdiction in others.\n\n\nThe U.S. Constitution safeguards judicial independence by providing that federal judges shall hold office \"during good behavior\"; in practice, this usually means they serve until they die, retire, or resign. A judge who commits an offense while in office may be impeached in the same way as the president or other officials of the federal government. U.S. judges are appointed by the president, subject to confirmation by the Senate. Another Constitutional provision prohibits Congress from reducing the pay of any present Article III judge. However, Congress is able to set a lower salary for all future judges who take office after such a pay reduction is passed by Congress.\n\n\n\n### Relationships between state and federal courts[edit]\n\n\nSeparate from, but not entirely independent of, this federal court system are the court systems of each state, each dealing with, in addition to federal law when not deemed preempted, a state's own laws, and having its own court rules and procedures. Although state governments and the federal government are legally *dual sovereigns*, the Supreme Court of the United States is in many cases the appellate court from the State Supreme Courts (e.g., absent the Court countenancing the applicability of the *doctrine of adequate and independent State grounds*). The Supreme Courts of each state are by this doctrine the final authority on the interpretation of the applicable state's laws and Constitution. Many state constitution provisions are equal in breadth to those of the U.S. Constitution, but are considered \"parallel\" (thus, where, for example, the right to privacy pursuant to a state constitution is broader than the federal right to privacy, and the asserted ground is explicitly held to be \"independent\", the question can be finally decided in a State Supreme Court—the U.S. Supreme Court will decline to take jurisdiction).\n\n\nA State Supreme Court, other than of its own accord, is bound *only* by the U.S. Supreme Court's interpretation of federal law, but is *not* bound by interpretation of federal law by the federal court of appeals for the federal circuit in which the state is included, or even the federal district courts located in the state, a result of the *dual sovereigns* concept. Conversely, a federal district court hearing a matter involving only a question of state law (usually through diversity jurisdiction) must apply the substantive law of the state in which the court sits, a result of the application of the *Erie Doctrine*; however, at the same time, the case is heard under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and the Federal Rules of Evidence instead of state procedural rules (that is, the application of the *Erie Doctrine* only extends to a requirement that a federal court asserting diversity jurisdiction apply *substantive* state law, but not *procedural* state law, which may be different). Together, the laws of the federal and state governments form U.S. law.\n\n\n\n## Budget[edit]\n\n\nMain article: United States federal budget\n\n![](image)Federal revenue and spending of the U.S. federal government as of 2021\n![](image)The financial ratio of federal debt to federal revenue from 1996 through 2022\nThe budget document often begins with the president's proposal to Congress recommending funding levels for the next fiscal year, beginning October 1 and ending on September 30 of the year following. The fiscal year refers to the year in which it ends.\n\n\nFor fiscal year (FY) 2018, the federal government spent $4.11 trillion. Spending equalled 20.3% of gross domestic product (GDP), equal to the 50-year average.[36] The deficit equaled $779 billion, 3.8 percent of GDP. Tax revenue amounted to $3.33 trillion, with receipt categories including individual income taxes ($1,684B or 51%), Social Security/Social Insurance taxes ($1,171B or 35%), and corporate taxes ($205B or 6%).[36]\n\n\n\n## Employees[edit]\n\n\nMain article: United States federal civil service\n\nThe United States federal government had about 2,096,000 civilian employees in FY2016, with about 173,000 of those in the District of Columbia (not counting the United States Postal Service).[37]\n\n\n\n## Elections and voting[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Elections in the United States\n\n![](image)Diagram of the Federal Government and American Union in 1862\nSuffrage, known as the ability to vote, has changed significantly over time. In the early years of the United States, voting was considered a matter for state governments, and was commonly restricted to white men who owned land. Direct elections were mostly held only for the U.S. House of Representatives and state legislatures, although what specific bodies were elected by the electorate varied from state to state. Under this original system, both senators representing each state in the U.S. Senate were chosen by a majority vote of the state legislature. Since the ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913, members of both houses of Congress have been directly elected. Today, U.S. citizens have almost universal suffrage under equal protection of the laws[38] from the age of 18,[39] regardless of race,[40] gender,[41] or wealth.[42] The only significant exception to this is the disenfranchisement of convicted felons, and in some states former felons as well.\n\n\nUnder the U.S. Constitution, the representation of U.S. territories and the federal district of District of Columbia in Congress is limited: while residents of the District of Columbia are subject to federal laws and federal taxes, their only congressional representative is a non-voting delegate; however, they have participated in presidential elections since March 29, 1961.[43]\n\n\nResidents of Puerto Rico other than federal employees do not pay federal personal income taxes on income that has its source in Puerto Rico,[44][45] and do not pay most federal excise taxes (for example, the federal gasoline tax);[45] however, Puerto Ricans pay all other federal taxes, including the federal payroll taxes that fund Social Security and Medicare; the FUTA tax; and business, gift, and estate taxes.[45][44] Puerto Rico is represented in the Congress by a nonvoting Resident Commissioner, a nonvoting delegate.[46]\n\n\n\n## State, tribal, and local governments[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: State governments of the United States, Tribal sovereignty in the United States, and Local government in the United States\n\n![United States](image)The states of the United States as divided into counties (or, in Louisiana and Alaska, parishes and boroughs, respectively). Alaska and Hawaii are not to scale and the Aleutian and uninhabited Northwestern Hawaiian Islands have been omitted.\nState governments have the greatest influence over most Americans' daily lives. The Tenth Amendment prohibits the federal government from exercising any power not delegated to it by the Constitution; as a result, states handle the majority of issues most relevant to individuals within their jurisdiction. Because state governments are not authorized to print currency, they generally have to raise revenue through either taxes or bonds. As a result, state governments tend to impose severe budget cuts or raise taxes any time the economy is faltering.[47]\n\n\nEach state has its own written constitution, government and code of laws. The Constitution stipulates only that each state must have, \"a Republican Government\". Therefore, there are often great differences in law and procedure between individual states, concerning issues such as property, crime, health and education, amongst others. The highest elected official of each state is the Governor, with below him being the Lieutenant Governor. Each state also has an elected state legislature (bicameralism is a feature of every state except Nebraska), whose members represent the voters of the state. Each state maintains its own state court system. In some states, supreme and lower court justices are elected by the people; in others, they are appointed, as they are in the federal system.\n\n\nAs a result of the Supreme Court case *Worcester v. Georgia*, American Indian tribes are considered \"domestic dependent nations\" that operate as sovereign governments subject to federal authority but, in some cases, outside of the jurisdiction of state governments. Hundreds of laws, executive orders and court cases have modified the governmental status of tribes vis-à-vis individual states, but the two have continued to be recognized as separate bodies. Tribal governments vary in robustness, from a simple council used to manage all aspects of tribal affairs, to large and complex bureaucracies with several branches of government. Tribes are currently encouraged to form their own governments, with power resting in elected tribal councils, elected tribal chairpersons, or religiously appointed leaders (as is the case with pueblos). Tribal citizenship and voting rights are typically restricted to individuals of native descent, but tribes are free to set whatever citizenship requirements they wish.\n\n\nThe institutions that are responsible for local government within states are typically counties, municipalities, and special-purpose districts, which make laws that affect their particular area. These laws concern issues such as traffic, the sale of alcohol and the keeping of animals. A county is an administrative or political subdivision of a state, while Louisiana and Alaska have county-equivalent subdivisions called parishes and boroughs, respectively. The specific governmental powers of counties vary widely between the states, with those in Connecticut, Rhode Island, and some parts of Alaska and Massachusetts having little or no power, existing only as geographic distinctions. In other areas, county governments have more power, such as to collect taxes and maintain law enforcement agencies. Twenty states further divide their counties into civil townships. Population centers may be organized into incorporated municipalities of several types, including the city, town, borough, and village. These municipal entities also vary from state to state, and typically subordinate to the government of a county or civil township. However, many rural and suburban regions are in unincorporated areas that have no municipal government below the county or civil township level. Certain cities have consolidated with their county government to form consolidated city-counties, or have been legally separated from counties altogether to form independent cities. States may also create special-purpose districts that perform a single function or a set of related functions within an area inside one or more counties or municipalities, like school districts, water management districts, fire management districts, and library districts.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| President[edit]* Executive Office\n* Line-item veto\n\nCourts[edit]* District courts\n* Federal courts\n* Federal judicial circuit\n | Law[edit]* U.S. Code\n\nAgencies[edit]* Federal agencies\n | * ![flag](image)United States portal\n* ![icon](image)Politics portal\n\nStates and territories[edit]* Political divisions\n* U.S. territory\n\nWorks and websites[edit]* Business.gov\n* Copyright status of work by the U.S. government\n* USA.gov\n\n\n |\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The U.S. Government Publishing Office specifies the capitalization of *Federal Government*, in regards to the national government of the United States, as a proper noun.[1]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"3\" (PDF). *U.S. Government Publishing Office Style Manual* (2016 ed.).

of the People's Republic of China** is based on a system of people's congress within the parameters of a unitary Marxism–Leninist state, in which the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP) enacts its policies through people's congresses. This system is based on the principle of unified state power, in which the legislature, the National People's Congress (NPC), is constitutionally enshrined as \"the highest state organ of power.\" As China's political system has no separation of powers, there is only one branch of government which is represented by the legislature. The CCP through the NPC enacts unified leadership, which requires that all state organs, from the Supreme People's Court to the President of the People's Republic of China, are elected by, answerable to, and have no separate powers than those granted to them by the NPC. The CCP controls appointments in all state bodies through a two-thirds majority in the NPC. The remaining seats are held by nominally independent delegates and eight minor political parties, which are non-oppositional and support the CCP. All government bodies and state-owned enterprises have internal CCP committees that lead the decision-making in these institutions. \n\n\nThe NPC meets annually for about two weeks in March to review and approve major new policy directions, and in between those sessions, delegates its powers to the working legislature, the NPC Standing Committee (NPCSC). This organ adopts most national legislation, interprets the constitution and laws, and conducts constitutional reviews, and is headed by the chairman, one of China's top officials. The president represents China abroad, though since the 1990s, the presidency has always been held by the CCP general secretary. Elected separately by the NPC, the vice president has no power other than what the president bestowed on them but assists the president. The head of the State Council, the NPC's executive organ, is the premier. The CCP general secretary is China's leading official since the CCP is tasked with formulating and setting national policy which the state, after being adopted by the NPC or relevant state organ, is responsible for implementing.[1][2]\n\n\nThe State Council, also referred to as the Central People's Government, consists of, besides the Premier, a variable number of vice premiers, five state councilors (protocol equal of vice premiers but with narrower portfolios), the secretary-general, and 26 ministers and other cabinet-level department heads. It consists of ministries and agencies with specific portfolios. The State Council presents most initiatives to the NPCSC for consideration after previous endorsement by the CCP's Politburo Standing Committee.\n\n\nChina's judicial organs are political organs that perform prosecutorial and court functions. Because of their political nature, China does not have judicial independence. China's courts are supervised by the Supreme People's Court (SPC), which answers to the NPC. The Supreme People's Procuratorate (SPP) is responsible for prosecutions and supervises procuracies at the provincial, prefecture, and county levels. At the same administrative ranking as the SPC and SPP, the National Supervisory Commission (NSC) was established in 2018 to investigate corruption within the CCP and state organs. All courts and their personnel are subject to the effective control of the CCP's Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## Relationship with the Chinese Communist Party[edit]\n\n\nAll government bodies in China are under the control of the CCP, with the CCP constitution declaring that the party is the \"highest force for political leadership\". Senior government officials throughout the country are appointed by the CCP, and are mostly CCP members.[4] All government departments, state-owned enterprises and public institutes include CCP committees, from the village level to the national level. The CCP committees in government bodies largely supervise and lead the bodies, with the State Council mostly dealing with economic matters. As outlined by the CCP constitution: \"Government, the military, society and schools, north, south, east and west – the party leads them all.\"[4]\n\n\nUnder the leadership of Deng Xiaoping, there were proposals to increase the separation of the state and the party, especially advocated by more liberal officials such as Zhao Ziyang.[5][4] The proposals included abolishing CCP committees from some government departments, increasing the influence of the State Council, and having professional managers leader SOEs instead of CCP committees. However, these proposals were eventually abandoned after the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre.[4]\n\n\nOn the relationship between the government and the CCP, James Palmer, writing for *Foreign Policy*, states that, \"[t]he Chinese government is essentially the shadow of the Communist Party, moving as the party does, and consequently government roles matter far less than party ones.\"[6] According to *The Economist*, \"[e]specially when meeting foreigners, officials may present name cards bearing government titles but stay quiet about party positions which may or may not outrank their state jobs.\"[7] According to scholar Rush Doshi, \"[t]he Party sits above the state, runs parallel to the state, and is enmeshed in every level of the state.\"[8]: 35\n\n\nThe integration of the CCP and the state has accelerated under Xi Jinping, chairing eight party commissions that direct government bodies.[4] Under Xi, several government and party bodies have also merged, with one party organization having an external state government name under the \"one institution with two names\" system, further blurring the lines between the party and the state.[4]\n\n\n\n## Constitution[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Constitution of the People's Republic of China\n\nThe Constitution of the PRC was first created on 20 September 1954, before which an interim constitution-like document created by the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference was in force. The second promulgation in 1975 shortened the constitution to just about 30 articles, containing CCP slogans and revolutionary language throughout.[*citation needed*] The role of courts was slashed, and the Presidency was gone. The 3rd promulgation in 1978 expanded the number of articles, but was still under the influence of the very-recent Cultural Revolution.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe current constitution is the PRC's fourth promulgation, declared on 4 December 1982, and has served as a stable constitution for 30 years. The legal power of the CCP is guaranteed by the PRC Constitution and its position as the supreme political authority in the People's Republic of China is put in practice through its comprehensive control of the state, military, and media.[9]\n\n\n\n## National People's Congress[edit]\n\n\nMain article: National People's Congress\n\nSee also: Standing Committee of the National People's Congress\n\n![](image)The 12th National People's Congress held in 2013\nThe National People's Congress (NPC) is the national legislature of China. With 2,977 members in 2023, it is the largest parliamentary body in the world.[10] Under China's current Constitution, the NPC is structured as a unicameral legislature, with the power to legislate, to oversee the operations of the government, and to elect the major officials of state. Its delegates are elected for a five-year term through a multi-tiered electoral system. According to the Constitution, the NPC is the highest state institution within China's political system.[11]: 78\n\n\nThe NPC and the National Committee of the People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), a consultative body whose members represent various people's organizations, are the main deliberative bodies of China, and are often referred to as the Two Sessions.[12] Aside from the CCP, eight minor political parties participate, but are non-oppositional and have no real power.[13][14] They must accept the primacy of the CCP to exist and their members are preapproved by the CCP's United Front Work Department.[15]\n\n\nThe NPC, elected for a term of five years, holds annual sessions every spring, usually lasting from 10 to 14 days, in the Great Hall of the People on the west side of Tiananmen Square, Beijing. These annual meetings are usually timed to occur with the meetings of the CPPCC, providing an opportunity for the officers of state to review past policies and present future plans to the nation. The fourth session of the 12th NPC was held from 5 to 16 March 2016.[16][*non-primary source needed*]\n\n\nThe NPC generally has a reputation of approving the work of the State Council and not engaging in overmuch drafting of laws itself. However, it and its Standing Committee have occasionally asserted themselves. For example, the State Council and the CCP were unable to secure passage of a fuel tax in 2009 to finance the construction of expressways.[17][18] The NPC Standing Committee is more assertive than the NPC itself and has vetoed proposed laws.[11]: 79\n\n\n\n## Leadership[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of leaders of the People's Republic of China\n\n### National leadership[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of national leaders of the People's Republic of China\n\n![](image)Emblem of the Chinese Communist Party ![](image)Paramount leader and General Secretary Xi Jinping\nThe CCP Politburo Standing Committee consists of the government's top leadership. Historically it has had five to nine members, and currently has seven members. Its officially mandated purpose is to conduct policy discussions and make decisions on major issues when the Politburo, a larger decision-making body, is not in session. According to the CCP's constitution, the General Secretary of the Central Committee must also be a member of the CCP Politburo Standing Committee.[19][*better source needed*]\n\n\nThe membership of the PSC is strictly ranked in protocol sequence. Historically, the general secretary (or party chairman) has been ranked first; the rankings of other leaders have varied over time. Since the 1990s, the general secretary (also the president), premier, chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, the chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the secretary of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, the party's top anti-graft body, and the first-ranked secretary of the CCP secretariat have consistently also been members of the Politburo Standing Committee.[20]\n\n\n\n### Paramount leader[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Paramount leader\n\nPower is concentrated in the \"paramount leader,\" an informal title currently occupied by Xi Jinping, who heads the four most important political and state offices: He is the general secretary of the CCP Central Committee, Chairman of the Central Military Commission, and President of the PRC.[21] Near the end of Hu Jintao's term in office, experts observed growing limitations to the paramount leader's *de facto* control over the government,[22] but at the 19th Party Congress in October 2017, Xi Jinping's term limits were removed and his powers were expanded.[23]\n\n\n\n### President[edit]\n\n\nMain article: President of the People's Republic of China\n\nFurther information: Vice President of the People's Republic of China\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | ![](image) |\n| Mao ZedongFirst Chairman | Li XiannianFirst President |\n\n\nUnder the PRC's constitution, the President of the People's Republic of China is a largely ceremonial office with limited powers.[24] However, since 1993, as a matter of convention, the presidency has been held simultaneously by the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, the top leader in the one-party system.[25] The office is officially regarded as an institution of the state rather than an administrative post; theoretically, the president serves at the pleasure of the National People's Congress, the legislature, and is not legally vested to take executive action on its own prerogative.[note 2] The current president is Xi Jinping, who took office in March 2013.\n\n\nThe office was first established in the Constitution of the People's Republic of China in 1954 and successively held by Mao Zedong and Liu Shaoqi. Liu fell into political disgrace during the Cultural Revolution, after which the office became vacant. The office was abolished under the Constitution of 1975, then reinstated in the Constitution of 1982, but with reduced powers. The official English-language translation of the title was \"Chairman\"; after 1982, this translation was changed to \"President\", although the Chinese title remains unchanged.[note 3] In March 2018, presidential term limits were abolished.[26]\n\n\n\n## State Council[edit]\n\n\nMain article: State Council of the People's Republic of China\n\nFurther information: Premier of the People's Republic of China and Ministries of the People's Republic of China\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| Zhou EnlaiFirst Premier | Li QiangCurrent Premier |\n\n\nThe State Council is the cabinet of China. It is officially appointed by the National People's Congress and is chaired by the premier and includes the heads of each governmental department and agency.[27] The premier is assisted by several vice premiers, currently four, each of them overseeing a certain area of administration.[28] The premier, vice premiers and the State Councilors collectively form the inner cabinet that regularly convenes for the State Council Executive Meeting.[29]: 76–80 The State Council includes 26 constituent ministries, and officially oversees the provincial-level governments throughout China.[30]\n\n\n\n## Central Military Commission[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Central Military Commission (China)\n\n![](image)The CMC is housed in the Ministry of National Defense compound (\"August 1st Building\")\nThe Central Military Commission (CMC) exercises the supreme command and control over the People's Liberation Army (PLA), the People's Armed Police, and the Militia. It operates within the CCP under the name \"Central Military Commission of the Communist Party of China\", and as the military arm of the central government under the name \"Central Military Commission of the People's Republic of China\". Under the arrangement of \"one institution with two names\", both commissions have identical personnel, organization and function, and operate under both the party and state systems.[31] The commission is headed by the CMC Chairman.[32]\n\n\n\n## National Supervisory Commission[edit]\n\n\nMain article: National Supervisory Commission\n\nThe National Supervisory Commission (NSC) is the highest state supervisory (anti-corruption) agency of China. At the same administrative ranking as the Supreme People's Court and Supreme People's Procuratorate, it supervises all public officials who exercise public power.[33] It closely operates together with the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of the CCP, and effectively acts as the state arm of the CCDI.[34] It replaced the former Ministry of Supervision.\n\n\n\n## Supreme People's Court and Supreme People's Procuratorate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Emblem of the People's Courts\n![](image)Emblem of the People's ProcuratorateMain articles: Supreme People's Court and Supreme People's Procuratorate\n\nThe Supreme People's Court is the judicial organ of the People's Republic of China and is subject to the control of the CCP's Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission.[3] Hong Kong and Macau, as special administrative regions, have separate judicial systems based on British common law traditions and Portuguese civil-law traditions, respectively. The judges of the Supreme People's Court are appointed by the National People's Congress.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Provincial and local government[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Administrative divisions of the People's Republic of China\n\nThe governors of China's provinces and autonomous regions and mayors of its directly administered municipalities are appointed by the State Council after receiving the nominal consent of the National People's Congress (NPC). The Hong Kong and Macau special administrative regions (SARS) have some local autonomy since they have separate governments, legal systems, and basic constitutional laws, but they come under Beijing's control in matters of foreign policy and national security, and their chief executives are effectively handpicked by the CCP Politburo.\n\n\nBelow the provincial level, there are prefectures and counties. Counties are divided into townships and villages. While most are run by appointed officials, some lower-level jurisdictions have direct elections.\n\n\nWhile operating under strict control and supervision by the central government, China's local governments manage relatively high share of fiscal revenues and expenditures.[35]\n\n\nThrough the late 1980s and the early 1990s, the municipal government regulatory mechanisms expanded, as did their capacity to regulate peri-urban areas.[36]: 81 The 1994 fiscal reforms resulted in the need of local governments to generate non-tax revenue, which they did in the form of revenues through land development and use fees.[36]: 82 This resulted in their increase in both administrative size and geographic size.[36]: 82 From 2002 to at least 2023, the cost of providing public goods has devolved to local governments from the central government and therefore local governments need to generate fees to provide public services.[36]: 82\n\n\nSince 2014, the National New-Type Urbanization Plan has resulted in the consolidation of planning processes that were formerly distributed across different bureaucracies, such as urban and rural land use, tourism planning, and environmental planning.[36]: 87\n\n\n\n### Policy development[edit]\n\n\nAfter the Chinese economic reform, China has been characterized by a high degree of political centralization but significant economic decentralization.[37][38]: 7 The central government sets the strategic direction while local officials carry it out.[38]: 7\n\n\nNew policies are often tested locally before being applied more widely, resulting in a policy process that involves experimentation and feedback.[39]: 14 This method of first implementing policy through local pilot testing was also used during the Mao era.[40]: 108 Generally, high level central government leadership refrains from drafting specific policies, instead using the informal networks and site visits to affirm or suggest changes to the direction of local policy experiments or pilot programs.[41]: 71 The typical approach is that central government leadership begins drafting formal policies, law, or regulations after policy has been developed at local levels.[41]: 71\n\n\n\n## Civil service[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Civil service of the People's Republic of China\nChina's civil service is divided into tiers.[42]: 147 The highest tiers (including department chiefs, deputy department chiefs, and section chiefs) have significant involvement in policy-making.[42]: 147\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Central People's Government (1949–54)\n* Five Yuans of the Republic of China\n* History of political parties in China\n* Political systems of Imperial China\n* Politics of the People's Republic of China\n\t+ Elections in China\n\t+ Orders of precedence in China\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The \"Paramount leader\" is not a formal title, that the leader is usually holding the titles of General Secretary of the Communist Party and Chairman of the Central Military Commission.\n2. **^** It is listed as such in the current Constitution; it is thus equivalent to organs such as the State Council, rather than to offices such as that of the premier.\n3. **^** In Chinese, the President of the PRC is termed *Zhǔxí* (主席) while the Presidents of other countries are termed *Zǒngtǒng* (总统). Furthermore *zhǔxí* continues to have the meaning of \"chairman\" in a generic context.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Natalie Liu (7 October 2022). \"View China's Xi as Party Leader, Not President, Scholars Say\". *Voice of America*.

of the People's Republic of China** is based on a system of people's congress within the parameters of a unitary Marxism–Leninist state, in which the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP) enacts its policies through people's congresses. This system is based on the principle of unified state power, in which the legislature, the National People's Congress (NPC), is constitutionally enshrined as \"the highest state organ of power.\" As China's political system has no separation of powers, there is only one branch of government which is represented by the legislature. The CCP through the NPC enacts unified leadership, which requires that all state organs, from the Supreme People's Court to the President of the People's Republic of China, are elected by, answerable to, and have no separate powers than those granted to them by the NPC. The CCP controls appointments in all state bodies through a two-thirds majority in the NPC. The remaining seats are held by nominally independent delegates and eight minor political parties, which are non-oppositional and support the CCP. All government bodies and state-owned enterprises have internal CCP committees that lead the decision-making in these institutions. \n\n\nThe NPC meets annually for about two weeks in March to review and approve major new policy directions, and in between those sessions, delegates its powers to the working legislature, the NPC Standing Committee (NPCSC). This organ adopts most national legislation, interprets the constitution and laws, and conducts constitutional reviews, and is headed by the chairman, one of China's top officials. The president represents China abroad, though since the 1990s, the presidency has always been held by the CCP general secretary. Elected separately by the NPC, the vice president has no power other than what the president bestowed on them but assists the president. The head of the State Council, the NPC's executive organ, is the premier. The CCP general secretary is China's leading official since the CCP is tasked with formulating and setting national policy which the state, after being adopted by the NPC or relevant state organ, is responsible for implementing.[1][2]\n\n\nThe State Council, also referred to as the Central People's Government, consists of, besides the Premier, a variable number of vice premiers, five state councilors (protocol equal of vice premiers but with narrower portfolios), the secretary-general, and 26 ministers and other cabinet-level department heads. It consists of ministries and agencies with specific portfolios. The State Council presents most initiatives to the NPCSC for consideration after previous endorsement by the CCP's Politburo Standing Committee.\n\n\nChina's judicial organs are political organs that perform prosecutorial and court functions. Because of their political nature, China does not have judicial independence. China's courts are supervised by the Supreme People's Court (SPC), which answers to the NPC. The Supreme People's Procuratorate (SPP) is responsible for prosecutions and supervises procuracies at the provincial, prefecture, and county levels. At the same administrative ranking as the SPC and SPP, the National Supervisory Commission (NSC) was established in 2018 to investigate corruption within the CCP and state organs. All courts and their personnel are subject to the effective control of the CCP's Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## Relationship with the Chinese Communist Party[edit]\n\n\nAll government bodies in China are under the control of the CCP, with the CCP constitution declaring that the party is the \"highest force for political leadership\". Senior government officials throughout the country are appointed by the CCP, and are mostly CCP members.[4] All government departments, state-owned enterprises and public institutes include CCP committees, from the village level to the national level. The CCP committees in government bodies largely supervise and lead the bodies, with the State Council mostly dealing with economic matters. As outlined by the CCP constitution: \"Government, the military, society and schools, north, south, east and west – the party leads them all.\"[4]\n\n\nUnder the leadership of Deng Xiaoping, there were proposals to increase the separation of the state and the party, especially advocated by more liberal officials such as Zhao Ziyang.[5][4] The proposals included abolishing CCP committees from some government departments, increasing the influence of the State Council, and having professional managers leader SOEs instead of CCP committees. However, these proposals were eventually abandoned after the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre.[4]\n\n\nOn the relationship between the government and the CCP, James Palmer, writing for *Foreign Policy*, states that, \"[t]he Chinese government is essentially the shadow of the Communist Party, moving as the party does, and consequently government roles matter far less than party ones.\"[6] According to *The Economist*, \"[e]specially when meeting foreigners, officials may present name cards bearing government titles but stay quiet about party positions which may or may not outrank their state jobs.\"[7] According to scholar Rush Doshi, \"[t]he Party sits above the state, runs parallel to the state, and is enmeshed in every level of the state.\"[8]: 35\n\n\nThe integration of the CCP and the state has accelerated under Xi Jinping, chairing eight party commissions that direct government bodies.[4] Under Xi, several government and party bodies have also merged, with one party organization having an external state government name under the \"one institution with two names\" system, further blurring the lines between the party and the state.[4]\n\n\n\n## Constitution[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Constitution of the People's Republic of China\n\nThe Constitution of the PRC was first created on 20 September 1954, before which an interim constitution-like document created by the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference was in force. The second promulgation in 1975 shortened the constitution to just about 30 articles, containing CCP slogans and revolutionary language throughout.[*citation needed*] The role of courts was slashed, and the Presidency was gone. The 3rd promulgation in 1978 expanded the number of articles, but was still under the influence of the very-recent Cultural Revolution.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe current constitution is the PRC's fourth promulgation, declared on 4 December 1982, and has served as a stable constitution for 30 years. The legal power of the CCP is guaranteed by the PRC Constitution and its position as the supreme political authority in the People's Republic of China is put in practice through its comprehensive control of the state, military, and media.[9]\n\n\n\n## National People's Congress[edit]\n\n\nMain article: National People's Congress\n\nSee also: Standing Committee of the National People's Congress\n\n![](image)The 12th National People's Congress held in 2013\nThe National People's Congress (NPC) is the national legislature of China. With 2,977 members in 2023, it is the largest parliamentary body in the world.[10] Under China's current Constitution, the NPC is structured as a unicameral legislature, with the power to legislate, to oversee the operations of the government, and to elect the major officials of state. Its delegates are elected for a five-year term through a multi-tiered electoral system. According to the Constitution, the NPC is the highest state institution within China's political system.[11]: 78\n\n\nThe NPC and the National Committee of the People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), a consultative body whose members represent various people's organizations, are the main deliberative bodies of China, and are often referred to as the Two Sessions.[12] Aside from the CCP, eight minor political parties participate, but are non-oppositional and have no real power.[13][14] They must accept the primacy of the CCP to exist and their members are preapproved by the CCP's United Front Work Department.[15]\n\n\nThe NPC, elected for a term of five years, holds annual sessions every spring, usually lasting from 10 to 14 days, in the Great Hall of the People on the west side of Tiananmen Square, Beijing. These annual meetings are usually timed to occur with the meetings of the CPPCC, providing an opportunity for the officers of state to review past policies and present future plans to the nation. The fourth session of the 12th NPC was held from 5 to 16 March 2016.[16][*non-primary source needed*]\n\n\nThe NPC generally has a reputation of approving the work of the State Council and not engaging in overmuch drafting of laws itself. However, it and its Standing Committee have occasionally asserted themselves. For example, the State Council and the CCP were unable to secure passage of a fuel tax in 2009 to finance the construction of expressways.[17][18] The NPC Standing Committee is more assertive than the NPC itself and has vetoed proposed laws.[11]: 79\n\n\n\n## Leadership[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of leaders of the People's Republic of China\n\n### National leadership[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of national leaders of the People's Republic of China\n\n![](image)Emblem of the Chinese Communist Party ![](image)Paramount leader and General Secretary Xi Jinping\nThe CCP Politburo Standing Committee consists of the government's top leadership. Historically it has had five to nine members, and currently has seven members. Its officially mandated purpose is to conduct policy discussions and make decisions on major issues when the Politburo, a larger decision-making body, is not in session. According to the CCP's constitution, the General Secretary of the Central Committee must also be a member of the CCP Politburo Standing Committee.[19][*better source needed*]\n\n\nThe membership of the PSC is strictly ranked in protocol sequence. Historically, the general secretary (or party chairman) has been ranked first; the rankings of other leaders have varied over time. Since the 1990s, the general secretary (also the president), premier, chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, the chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the secretary of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, the party's top anti-graft body, and the first-ranked secretary of the CCP secretariat have consistently also been members of the Politburo Standing Committee.[20]\n\n\n\n### Paramount leader[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Paramount leader\n\nPower is concentrated in the \"paramount leader,\" an informal title currently occupied by Xi Jinping, who heads the four most important political and state offices: He is the general secretary of the CCP Central Committee, Chairman of the Central Military Commission, and President of the PRC.[21] Near the end of Hu Jintao's term in office, experts observed growing limitations to the paramount leader's *de facto* control over the government,[22] but at the 19th Party Congress in October 2017, Xi Jinping's term limits were removed and his powers were expanded.[23]\n\n\n\n### President[edit]\n\n\nMain article: President of the People's Republic of China\n\nFurther information: Vice President of the People's Republic of China\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | ![](image) |\n| Mao ZedongFirst Chairman | Li XiannianFirst President |\n\n\nUnder the PRC's constitution, the President of the People's Republic of China is a largely ceremonial office with limited powers.[24] However, since 1993, as a matter of convention, the presidency has been held simultaneously by the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, the top leader in the one-party system.[25] The office is officially regarded as an institution of the state rather than an administrative post; theoretically, the president serves at the pleasure of the National People's Congress, the legislature, and is not legally vested to take executive action on its own prerogative.[note 2] The current president is Xi Jinping, who took office in March 2013.\n\n\nThe office was first established in the Constitution of the People's Republic of China in 1954 and successively held by Mao Zedong and Liu Shaoqi. Liu fell into political disgrace during the Cultural Revolution, after which the office became vacant. The office was abolished under the Constitution of 1975, then reinstated in the Constitution of 1982, but with reduced powers. The official English-language translation of the title was \"Chairman\"; after 1982, this translation was changed to \"President\", although the Chinese title remains unchanged.[note 3] In March 2018, presidential term limits were abolished.[26]\n\n\n\n## State Council[edit]\n\n\nMain article: State Council of the People's Republic of China\n\nFurther information: Premier of the People's Republic of China and Ministries of the People's Republic of China\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| Zhou EnlaiFirst Premier | Li QiangCurrent Premier |\n\n\nThe State Council is the cabinet of China. It is officially appointed by the National People's Congress and is chaired by the premier and includes the heads of each governmental department and agency.[27] The premier is assisted by several vice premiers, currently four, each of them overseeing a certain area of administration.[28] The premier, vice premiers and the State Councilors collectively form the inner cabinet that regularly convenes for the State Council Executive Meeting.[29]: 76–80 The State Council includes 26 constituent ministries, and officially oversees the provincial-level governments throughout China.[30]\n\n\n\n## Central Military Commission[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Central Military Commission (China)\n\n![](image)The CMC is housed in the Ministry of National Defense compound (\"August 1st Building\")\nThe Central Military Commission (CMC) exercises the supreme command and control over the People's Liberation Army (PLA), the People's Armed Police, and the Militia. It operates within the CCP under the name \"Central Military Commission of the Communist Party of China\", and as the military arm of the central government under the name \"Central Military Commission of the People's Republic of China\". Under the arrangement of \"one institution with two names\", both commissions have identical personnel, organization and function, and operate under both the party and state systems.[31] The commission is headed by the CMC Chairman.[32]\n\n\n\n## National Supervisory Commission[edit]\n\n\nMain article: National Supervisory Commission\n\nThe National Supervisory Commission (NSC) is the highest state supervisory (anti-corruption) agency of China. At the same administrative ranking as the Supreme People's Court and Supreme People's Procuratorate, it supervises all public officials who exercise public power.[33] It closely operates together with the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of the CCP, and effectively acts as the state arm of the CCDI.[34] It replaced the former Ministry of Supervision.\n\n\n\n## Supreme People's Court and Supreme People's Procuratorate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Emblem of the People's Courts\n![](image)Emblem of the People's ProcuratorateMain articles: Supreme People's Court and Supreme People's Procuratorate\n\nThe Supreme People's Court is the judicial organ of the People's Republic of China and is subject to the control of the CCP's Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission.[3] Hong Kong and Macau, as special administrative regions, have separate judicial systems based on British common law traditions and Portuguese civil-law traditions, respectively. The judges of the Supreme People's Court are appointed by the National People's Congress.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Provincial and local government[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Administrative divisions of the People's Republic of China\n\nThe governors of China's provinces and autonomous regions and mayors of its directly administered municipalities are appointed by the State Council after receiving the nominal consent of the National People's Congress (NPC). The Hong Kong and Macau special administrative regions (SARS) have some local autonomy since they have separate governments, legal systems, and basic constitutional laws, but they come under Beijing's control in matters of foreign policy and national security, and their chief executives are effectively handpicked by the CCP Politburo.\n\n\nBelow the provincial level, there are prefectures and counties. Counties are divided into townships and villages. While most are run by appointed officials, some lower-level jurisdictions have direct elections.\n\n\nWhile operating under strict control and supervision by the central government, China's local governments manage relatively high share of fiscal revenues and expenditures.[35]\n\n\nThrough the late 1980s and the early 1990s, the municipal government regulatory mechanisms expanded, as did their capacity to regulate peri-urban areas.[36]: 81 The 1994 fiscal reforms resulted in the need of local governments to generate non-tax revenue, which they did in the form of revenues through land development and use fees.[36]: 82 This resulted in their increase in both administrative size and geographic size.[36]: 82 From 2002 to at least 2023, the cost of providing public goods has devolved to local governments from the central government and therefore local governments need to generate fees to provide public services.[36]: 82\n\n\nSince 2014, the National New-Type Urbanization Plan has resulted in the consolidation of planning processes that were formerly distributed across different bureaucracies, such as urban and rural land use, tourism planning, and environmental planning.[36]: 87\n\n\n\n### Policy development[edit]\n\n\nAfter the Chinese economic reform, China has been characterized by a high degree of political centralization but significant economic decentralization.[37][38]: 7 The central government sets the strategic direction while local officials carry it out.[38]: 7\n\n\nNew policies are often tested locally before being applied more widely, resulting in a policy process that involves experimentation and feedback.[39]: 14 This method of first implementing policy through local pilot testing was also used during the Mao era.[40]: 108 Generally, high level central government leadership refrains from drafting specific policies, instead using the informal networks and site visits to affirm or suggest changes to the direction of local policy experiments or pilot programs.[41]: 71 The typical approach is that central government leadership begins drafting formal policies, law, or regulations after policy has been developed at local levels.[41]: 71\n\n\n\n## Civil service[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Civil service of the People's Republic of China\nChina's civil service is divided into tiers.[42]: 147 The highest tiers (including department chiefs, deputy department chiefs, and section chiefs) have significant involvement in policy-making.[42]: 147\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Central People's Government (1949–54)\n* Five Yuans of the Republic of China\n* History of political parties in China\n* Political systems of Imperial China\n* Politics of the People's Republic of China\n\t+ Elections in China\n\t+ Orders of precedence in China\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The \"Paramount leader\" is not a formal title, that the leader is usually holding the titles of General Secretary of the Communist Party and Chairman of the Central Military Commission.\n2. **^** It is listed as such in the current Constitution; it is thus equivalent to organs such as the State Council, rather than to offices such as that of the premier.\n3. **^** In Chinese, the President of the PRC is termed *Zhǔxí* (主席) while the Presidents of other countries are termed *Zǒngtǒng* (总统). Furthermore *zhǔxí* continues to have the meaning of \"chairman\" in a generic context.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Natalie Liu (7 October 2022). \"View China's Xi as Party Leader, Not President, Scholars Say\". *Voice of America*.

branches and is based on popular sovereignty. The Government runs under the framework established by the Constitution of Japan, adopted in 1947. It is a unitary state, containing forty-seven administrative divisions, with the Emperor as its Head of State.[1] His role is ceremonial and he has no powers related to Government.[2] Instead, it is the Cabinet, comprising the Ministers of State and the Prime Minister, that directs and controls the Government and the civil service. The Cabinet has the executive power and is formed by the Prime Minister, who is the Head of Government.[3][4] The Prime Minister is nominated by the National Diet and appointed to office by the Emperor.[5][6]\n\n\nThe National Diet is the legislature, the organ of the Legislative branch. It is bicameral, consisting of two houses with the House of Councilors being the upper house, and the House of Representatives being the lower house. Its members are directly elected by the people, who are the source of sovereignty.[7] It is defined as the supreme organ of sovereignty in the Constitution. The Supreme Court and other lower courts make up the Judicial branch and have all the judicial powers in the state. It has ultimate judicial authority to interpret the Japanese constitution and the power of judicial review. They are independent from the executive and the legislative branches.[8] Judges are nominated or appointed by the Cabinet and never removed by the executive or the legislature except during impeachment.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nBefore The Meiji Restoration, Japan was ruled by the government of a successive military *shōgun*. During this period, effective power of the government resided in the Shōgun, who officially ruled the country in the name of the Emperor.[9] The Shōgun were the hereditary military governors, with their modern rank equivalent to a generalissimo. Although the Emperor was the sovereign who appointed the Shōgun, his roles were ceremonial and he took no part in governing the country.[10] This is often compared to the present role of the Emperor, whose official role is to appoint the Prime Minister.[11]\n\n\n\"Taiseihokan\"（大政奉還）The return of political power to the Emperor (to the Imperial Court) in 1868 meant the resignation of Shōgun Tokugawa Yoshinobu, agreeing to \"be the instrument for carrying out\" the Emperor's orders.[12] This event restored the country to Imperial rule and the proclamation of the Empire of Japan. In 1889, the Meiji Constitution was adopted in a move to strengthen Japan to the level of western nations, resulting in the first parliamentary system in Asia.[13] It provided a form of mixed constitutional-absolute monarchy, with an independent judiciary, based on the Prussian model of the time.[14]\n\n\nA new aristocracy known as the *kazoku* was established. It merged the ancient court nobility of the Heian period, the *kuge*, and the former *daimyō*, feudal lords subordinate to the *shōgun*.[15] It also established the Imperial Diet, consisting of the House of Representatives and the House of Peers. Members of the House of Peers were made up of the Imperial Family, the Kazoku, and those nominated by the Emperor,[16] while members of the House of Representatives were elected by direct male suffrage.[17] Despite clear distinctions between powers of the executive branch and the Emperor in the Meiji Constitution, ambiguity and contradictions in the Constitution eventually led to a political crisis.[18] It also devalued the notion of civilian control over the military, which meant that the military could develop and exercise a great influence on politics.[19]\n\n\nFollowing the end of World War II, the present Constitution of Japan was adopted. It replaced the previous Imperial rule with a form of Western-style liberal democracy.[20]\n\n\nAs of 2020, the Japan Research Institute found the national government is mostly analog, because only 7.5% (4,000 of the 55,000) administrative procedures can be completed entirely online. The rate is 7.8% at the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, 8% at the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, and only 1.3% at the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries.[21]\n\n\nOn 12 February, 2021, Tetsushi Sakamoto was appointed as the Minister of Loneliness to alleviate social isolation and loneliness across different age groups and genders.[22]\n\n\n\n## The Emperor[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko seated in the Chamber of the House of Councillors of the National Diet, with members of the imperial family, the cabinet, and prime minister Naoto Kan giving the government's speech in front of the assembled members of parliament (2010)\nThe Emperor of Japan (天皇) is the head of the Imperial Family and the ceremonial head of state. He is defined by the Constitution to be \"the symbol of the State and of the unity of the people\".[7] However, his role is entirely ceremonial and representative in nature. As explicitly stated in article 4 of the Constitution, he has no powers related to government.[23]\n\n\nArticle 6 of the Constitution of Japan delegates the Emperor the following ceremonial roles:\n\n\n\n1. Appointment of the Prime Minister as designated by the Diet.\n2. Appointment of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court as designated by the Cabinet.\n\n\nWhile the Cabinet is the source of executive power and most of its power is exercised directly by the Prime Minister, several of its powers are exercised through the Emperor. The powers exercised via the Emperor, as stipulated by Article 7 of the Constitution, are:\n\n\n\n1. Promulgation of amendments of the constitution, laws, cabinet orders and treaties.\n\n\n1. Dissolution of the House of Representatives.\n2. Proclamation of general election of members of the Diet.\n3. Attestation of the appointment and dismissal of Ministers of State and other officials as provided for by law, and of full powers and credentials of Ambassadors and Ministers.\n4. Attestation of general and special amnesty, commutation of punishment, reprieve, and restoration of rights.\n5. Awarding of honors.\n6. Attestation of instruments of ratification and other diplomatic documents as provided for by law.\n7. Receiving foreign ambassadors and ministers.\n8. Performance of ceremonial functions.\n\n\nThese powers are exercised in accordance with the binding advice of the Cabinet.\n\n\nThe Emperor is known to hold the nominal ceremonial authority. For example, he is the only person that has the authority to appoint the Prime Minister, even though the Diet has the power to designate the person fitted for the position. One such example can be prominently seen in the 2009 Dissolution of the House of Representatives. The House was expected to be dissolved on the advice of the Prime Minister, but was temporarily unable to do so for the next general election, as both the Emperor and Empress were visiting Canada.[24][25]\n\n\nIn this manner, the Emperor's modern role is often compared to those of the Shogunate period and much of Japan's history, whereby the Emperor held great symbolic authority but had little political power; which is often held by others nominally appointed by the Emperor himself. Today, a legacy has somewhat continued for a retired Prime Minister who still wields considerable power, to be called a *Shadow Shogun* (闇将軍).[26]\n\n\nUnlike his European counterparts, the Emperor is not the source of sovereign power and the government does not act under his name. Instead, the Emperor represents the State and appoints other high officials in the name of the State, in which the Japanese people hold sovereignty.[27] Article 5 of the Constitution, in accordance with the Imperial Household Law, allows a regency to be established in the Emperor's name, should the Emperor be unable to perform his duties.[28]\n\n\nOn November 20, 1989, the Supreme Court ruled it doesn't have judicial power over the Emperor.[29]\n\n\nThe Imperial House of Japan is said to be the oldest continuing hereditary monarchy in the world.[30] According to the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, Japan was founded by the Imperial House in 660 BC by Emperor Jimmu (神武天皇).[31] Emperor Jimmu was the first Emperor of Japan and the ancestor of all of the Emperors that followed.[32] He is, according to Japanese mythology, the direct descendant of Amaterasu (天照大御神), the sun goddess of the native Shinto religion, through Ninigi, his great-grandfather.[33][34]\n\n\nThe **Current Emperor of Japan** (今上天皇) is Naruhito. He was officially enthroned on May 1, 2019, following the abdication of his father.[35][36] He is styled as *His Imperial Majesty* (天皇陛下), and his reign bears the era name of **Reiwa** (令和). Fumihito is the heir presumptive to the Chrysanthemum Throne.\n\n\n\n## Executive[edit]\n\n\nThe **Executive branch** of Japan is headed by the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister is the head of the Cabinet, and is designated by the legislative organ, the National Diet.[5] The Cabinet consists of the Ministers of State and may be appointed or dismissed by the Prime Minister at any time.[4] Explicitly defined to be the source of executive power, it is in practice, however, mainly exercised by the Prime Minister. The practice of its powers is responsible to the Diet, and as a whole, should the Cabinet lose confidence and support to be in office by the Diet, the Diet may dismiss the Cabinet *en masse* with a motion of no confidence.[37]\n\n\n\n### Prime Minister[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Crest of the Prime Minister of Japan\nThe **Prime Minister of Japan** (内閣総理大臣) is designated by the National Diet and serves a term of four years or less; with no limits imposed on the number of terms the Prime Minister may hold. The Prime Minister heads the Cabinet and exercises \"control and supervision\" of the executive branch, and is the head of government and commander-in-chief of the Japan Self-Defense Forces.[38] The prime minister is vested with the power to present bills to the Diet, to sign laws, to declare a state of emergency, and may also dissolve the Diet's House of Representatives at will.[39] The prime minister presides over the Cabinet and appoints, or dismisses, the other Cabinet ministers.[4]\n\n\nBoth houses of the National Diet designates the Prime Minister with a ballot cast under the run-off system. Under the Constitution, should both houses not agree on a common candidate, then a joint committee is allowed to be established to agree on the matter; specifically within a period of ten days, exclusive of the period of recess.[40] However, if both houses still do not agree to each other, the decision made by the House of Representatives is deemed to be that of the National Diet.[40] Upon designation, the Prime Minister is presented with their commission, and then formally appointed to office by the Emperor.[6]\n\n\nAs a candidate designated by the Diet, the prime minister is required to report to the Diet whenever demanded.[41] The prime minister must also be both a civilian and a member of either house of the Diet.[42]\n\n\n\nFor a list of prime ministers prior to 2001, see List of prime ministers of Japan.\n\n\n\n| No. | Name (English) | Name (Japanese) | Gender | Took office | Left office | Term | Cabinets\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | Junichiro Koizumi | 小泉 純一郎\n | Male\n | April 26, 2001\n | September 26, 2006\n | 5 years, 153 days\n | 87th: Koizumi I (R1) (R2)88th: Koizumi II (R)89th: Koizumi III (R) |\n| 2\n | Shinzo Abe | 安倍 晋三\n | Male\n | September 26, 2006\n | September 26, 2007\n | 1 year, 0 days\n | 90th: S.

The members of the Cabinet are appointed by the Prime Minister, and under the Cabinet Law, the number of members of the Cabinet appointed, excluding the Prime Minister, must be fourteen or less, but may only be increased to nineteen should a special need arise.[43][44] Article 68 of the Constitution states that all members of the Cabinet must be civilians and the majority of them must be chosen from among the members of either house of the National Diet.[45] The precise wording leaves an opportunity for the Prime Minister to appoint some non-elected Diet officials.[46] The Cabinet is required to resign *en masse* while still continuing its functions, till the appointment of a new Prime Minister, when the following situation arises:\n\n\n\n1. The Diet's House of Representatives passes a non-confidence resolution, or rejects a confidence resolution, unless the House of Representatives is dissolved within the next ten days.\n2. When there is a vacancy in the post of the Prime Minister, or upon the first convocation of the Diet after a general election of the members of the House of Representatives.\n\n\nConceptually deriving legitimacy from the Diet, whom it is responsible to, the Cabinet exercises its power in two different ways. In practice, much of its power is exercised by the Prime Minister, while others are exercised nominally by the Emperor.[3]\n\n\nArticle 73 of the Constitution of Japan expects the Cabinet to perform the following functions, in addition to general administration:\n\n\n\n1. Administer the law faithfully; conduct affairs of state.\n2. Manage foreign affairs.\n3. Conclude treaties. However, it shall obtain prior or, depending on circumstances, subsequent approval of the Diet.\n4. Administer the civil service, in accordance with standards established by law.\n5. Prepare the budget, and present it to the Diet.\n6. Enact cabinet orders in order to execute the provisions of this Constitution and of the law. However, it cannot include penal provisions in such cabinet orders unless authorized by such law.\n7. Decide on general amnesty, special amnesty, commutation of punishment, reprieve, and restoration of rights.\n\n\nUnder the Constitution, all laws and cabinet orders must be signed by the competent Minister and countersigned by the Prime Minister, before being formally promulgated by the Emperor. Also, all members of the Cabinet cannot be subject to legal action without the consent of the Prime Minister; however, without impairing the right to take legal action.[47]\n\n\n\nFor an updated list of members of the Cabinet, see Current Cabinet of Japan.\n\nMain article: Current Japanese cabinet\n\nAs of 14 December 2023,[update] the makeup of the Cabinet:[48]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|

Building\n![](image)Politics of the Constitution of JapanMain article: Ministries of Japan\n\nThe **ministries of Japan** (中央省庁, *Chuo shōcho*) consist of eleven executive ministries and the Cabinet Office. Each ministry is headed by a Minister of State, which are mainly senior legislators, and are appointed from among the members of the Cabinet by the Prime Minister. The Cabinet Office, formally headed by the Prime Minister, is an agency that handles the day-to-day affairs of the Cabinet. The ministries are the most influential part of the daily-exercised executive power, and since few ministers serve for more than a year or so necessary to grab hold of the organisation, most of its power lies within the senior bureaucrats.[49]\n\n\nBelow is a series of ministry-affiliated government agencies and bureaus responsible for government procedures and activities as of 23 August 2022.[50]\n\n\n\n* Cabinet Office\n\t+ National Public Safety Commission\n\t+ National Police Agency\n\t+ Consumer Affairs Agency\n\t+ Financial Services Agency\n\t+ Fair Trade Commission\n\t+ Food Safety Commission\n\t+ Personal Information Protection Commission\n\t+ Imperial Household Agency\n\t+ Gender Equality Bureau\n\t+ Council on Economic and Fiscal Policy\n\t+ Atomic Energy Commission\n\t+ International Peace Cooperation\n\t+ Council for Science, Technology and Innovation\n\t+ Headquarters for Ocean Policy\n\t+ Northern Territories Affairs Administration\n\t+ Public Relations Office of the Government of Japan\n* Cabinet Secretariat\n\t+ National Information Security Centre\n\t+ National Personnel Authority\n\t+ Coordination Office of Measures on Emerging Infectious Diseases\n\t+ Headquarters for the Abduction Issue\n\t+ Cabinet Legislation Bureau\n\t+ Office of Policy Planning and Coordination on Territory and Sovereignty\n\n\n* Reconstruction Agency\n* Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications\n\t+ Environmental Dispute Coordination Commission\n\t+ Fire and Disaster Management Agency\n* Ministry of Justice\n\t+ Public Security Examination Commission\n\t+ Public Security Intelligence Agency\n\t+ Public Prosecutors Office\n\t+ Immigration Services Agency\n* Ministry of Foreign Affairs\n* Ministry of Finance\n\t+ National Tax Agency\n\t+ Japan Customs\n* Ministry of Defense\n\t+ Acquisition, Technology and Logistics Agency\n\t+ Japan Self-Defence Forces (Ground / Maritime / Air)\n\t+ Joint Staff\n* Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT)\n\t+ Education Policy Bureau\n\t+ Elementary and Secondary Education Bureau\n\t+ Higher Education Bureau\n\t+ Science and Technology Policy Bureau\n\t+ Research Promotion Bureau\n\t+ Agency for Cultural Affairs\n\t+ Japan Sports Agency\n\t+ The Japan Art Academy\n\t+ National Institute for Educational Policy Research\n\t+ National Institute of Science and Technology Policy\n\t+ The Japan Academy\n\t+ Headquarters for Earthquake Research Promotion\n\t+ Japanese National Commission for UNESCO\n* Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare\n\t+ Pension Service\n\t+ Central Labour Relations Commission\n\n\n* Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries\n\t+ Fisheries Agency\n\t+ Forestry Agency\n* Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI)\n\t+ Agency for Natural Resources and Energy\n\t+ Small and Medium Enterprise Agency\n\t+ Japan Patent Office\n\n\n* Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT)\n\t+ Japan Transport Safety Board\n\t+ Japan Tourism Agency\n\t+ Japan Meteorological Agency\n\t+ Japan Coast Guard\n* Ministry of the Environment\n\t+ Nuclear Regulation Authority\n* Board of Audit\n\n\n## Legislative[edit]\n\n\n![](image)National Diet Building, Nagatachō, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo\nMain article: National Diet\n\nThe **Legislative branch** organ of Japan is the **National Diet** (国会). It is a bicameral legislature, composing of a lower house, the House of Representatives, and an upper house, the House of Councillors. Empowered by the Constitution to be \"the highest organ of State power\" and the only \"sole law-making organ of the State\", its houses are both directly elected under a parallel voting system and is ensured by the Constitution to have no discrimination on the qualifications of each members; whether be it based on \"race, creed, sex, social status, family origin, education, property or income\". The National Diet, therefore, reflects the sovereignty of the people; a principle of popular sovereignty whereby the supreme power lies within, in this case, the Japanese people.[7][51]\n\n\nThe Diet responsibilities includes the making of laws, the approval of the annual national budget, the approval of the conclusion of treaties and the selection of the Prime Minister. In addition, it has the power to initiate draft constitutional amendments, which, if approved, are to be presented to the people for ratification in a referendum before being promulgated by the Emperor, in the name of the people.[52] The Constitution also enables both houses to conduct investigations in relation to government, demand the presence and testimony of witnesses, and the production of records, as well as allowing either house of the Diet to demand the presence of the Prime Minister or the other Minister of State, in order to give answers or explanations whenever so required.[41] The Diet is also able to impeach Court judges convicted of criminal or irregular conduct. The Constitution, however, does not specify the voting methods, the number of members of each house, and all other matters pertaining to the method of election of the each members, and are thus, allowed to be determined for by law.[53]\n\n\nUnder the provisions of the Constitution and by law, all adults aged over 18 are eligible to vote, with a secret ballot and a universal suffrage, and those elected have certain protections from apprehension while the Diet is in session.[54] Speeches, debates, and votes cast in the Diet also enjoy parliamentary privileges. Each house is responsible for disciplining its own members, and all deliberations are public unless two-thirds or more of those members present passes a resolution agreeing it otherwise. The Diet also requires the presence of at least one-third of the membership of either house in order to constitute a quorum.[55] All decisions are decided by a majority of those present, unless otherwise stated by the Constitution, and in the case of a tie, the presiding officer has the right to decide the issue. A member cannot be expelled, however, unless a majority of two-thirds or more of those members present passes a resolution therefor.[56]\n\n\nUnder the Constitution, at least one session of the Diet must be convened each year. The Cabinet can also, at will, convoke extraordinary sessions of the Diet and is required to, when a quarter or more of the total members of either house demands it.[57] During an election, only the House of Representatives is dissolved. The House of Councillors is however, not dissolved but only closed, and may, in times of national emergency, be convoked for an emergency session.[58] The Emperor both convokes the Diet and dissolves the House of Representatives, but only does so on the advice of the Cabinet.\n\n\nFor bills to become Law, they are to be first passed by both houses of the National Diet, signed by the Ministers of State, countersigned by the Prime Minister, and then finally promulgated by the Emperor; however, without specifically giving the Emperor the power to oppose legislation.\n\n\n\n### House of Representatives[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Chamber of the House of Representatives\nThe **House of Representatives of Japan** (衆議院) is the Lower house, with the members of the house being elected once every four years, or when dissolved, for a four-year term.[59] As of November 18, 2017, it has 465 members. Of these, 176 members are elected from 11 multi-member constituencies by a party-list system of proportional representation, and 289 are elected from single-member constituencies. 233 seats are required for majority. The House of Representatives is the more powerful house out of the two, it is able to override vetoes on bills imposed by the House of Councillors with a two-thirds majority. It can, however, be dissolved by the Prime Minister at will.[39] Members of the house must be of Japanese nationality; those aged 18 years and older may vote, while those aged 25 years and older may run for office in the lower house.[54]\n\n\nThe legislative powers of the House of Representatives is considered to be more powerful than that of the House of Councillors. While the House of Councillors has the ability to veto most decisions made by the House of Representatives, some however, can only be delayed. This includes the legislation of treaties, the budget, and the selection of the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister, and collectively his Cabinet, can in turn, however, dissolve the House of Representatives whenever intended.[39] While the House of Representatives is considered to be officially dissolved upon the preparation of the document, the House is only formally dissolved by the dissolution ceremony.[60] The dissolution ceremony of the House is as follows:[61]\n\n\n\n1. The document is rubber stamped by the Emperor, and wrapped in a purple silk cloth; an indication of a document of state act, done on behalf of the people.\n2. The document is passed on to the Chief Cabinet Secretary at the House of Representatives President's reception room.\n3. The document is taken to the Chamber for preparation by the General-Secretary.\n4. The General-Secretary prepares the document for reading by the Speaker.\n5. The Speaker of the House of Representatives promptly declares the dissolution of the House.\n6. The House of Representatives is formally dissolved.\n\n\nIt is customary that, upon the dissolution of the House, members will shout the **Three Cheers of Banzai** (萬歲).[60][62]\n\n\n\n### House of Councillors[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Chamber of the House of Councillors\nThe **House of Councillors of Japan** (参議院) is the Upper house, with half the members of the house being elected once every three years, for a six-year term. As of November 18, 2017, it has 242 members. Of these, 73 are elected from the 47 prefectural districts, by single non-transferable votes, and 48 are elected from a nationwide list by proportional representation with open lists. The House of Councillors cannot be dissolved by the Prime Minister.[58] Members of the house must be of Japanese nationality; those aged 18 years and older may vote, while those aged 30 years and older may run for office in the upper house.[54]\n\n\nAs the House of Councillors can veto a decision made by the House of Representatives, the House of Councillors can cause the House of Representatives to reconsider its decision. The House of Representatives however, can still insist on its decision by overriding the veto by the House of Councillors with a two-thirds majority of its members present. Each year, and when required, the National Diet is convoked at the House of Councillors, on the advice of the Cabinet, for an extra or an ordinary session, by the Emperor. A short speech is, however, usually first made by the Speaker of the House of Representatives before the Emperor proceeds to convoke the Diet with his Speech from the throne.[63]\n\n\n\n## Judicial[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Supreme Court Building, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo\n![](image)Tokyo High Court Building\nMain article: Judicial system of Japan\n\nThe **Judicial branch** of Japan consists of the Supreme Court, and four other lower courts; the High Courts, District Courts, Family Courts and Summary Courts.[64] Divided into four basic tiers, the Court's independence from the executive and legislative branches are guaranteed by the Constitution, and is stated as: \"no extraordinary tribunal shall be established, nor shall any organ or agency of the Executive be given final judicial power\"; a feature known as the Separation of Powers.[8] Article 76 of the Constitution states that all the Court judges are independent in the exercise of their own conscience and that they are only bounded by the Constitution and the laws.[65] Court judges are removable only by public impeachment, and can only be removed, without impeachment, when they are judicially declared mentally or physically incompetent to perform their duties.[66] The Constitution also explicitly denies any power for executive organs or agencies to administer disciplinary actions against judges.[66] However, a Supreme Court judge may be dismissed by a majority in a referendum; of which, must occur during the first general election of the National Diet's House of Representatives following the judge's appointment, and also the first general election for every ten years lapse thereafter.[67] Trials must be conducted, with judgment declared, publicly, unless the Court \"unanimously determines publicity to be dangerous to public order or morals\"; with the exception for trials of political offenses, offenses involving the press, and cases wherein the rights of people as guaranteed by the Constitution, which cannot be deemed and conducted privately.[68] Court judges are appointed by the Cabinet, in attestation of the Emperor, while the Chief Justice is appointed by the Emperor, after being nominated by the Cabinet; which in practice, known to be under the recommendation of the former Chief Justice.[69]\n\n\nThe Legal system in Japan has been historically influenced by Chinese law; developing independently during the Edo period through texts such as *Kujikata Osadamegaki*.[70] It has, however, changed during the Meiji Restoration, and is now largely based on the European civil law; notably, the civil code based on the German model still remains in effect.[71] A quasi-jury system has recently came into use, and the legal system also includes a bill of rights since May 3, 1947.[72] The collection of Six Codes makes up the main body of the Japanese statutory law.[71]\n\n\nAll Statutory Laws in Japan are required to be rubber stamped by the Emperor with the **Privy Seal of Japan** (天皇御璽), and no Law can take effect without the Cabinet's signature, the Prime Minister's countersignature and the Emperor's promulgation.[73][74][75][76][77]\n\n\n\n### Supreme Court[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Building of the Supreme Court of Japan\nThe **Supreme Court of Japan** (最高裁判所) is the court of last resort and has the power of Judicial review; as defined by the Constitution to be \"the court of last resort with power to determine the constitutionality of any law, order, regulation or official act\".[78] The Supreme Court is also responsible for nominating judges to lower courts and determining judicial procedures. It also oversees the judicial system, overseeing activities of public prosecutors, and disciplining judges and other judicial personnel.[79]\n\n\n\n### High Courts[edit]\n\n\nThe **High Courts of Japan** (高等裁判所) has the jurisdiction to hear appeals to judgments rendered by District Courts and Family Courts, excluding cases under the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. Criminal appeals are directly handled by the High Courts, but Civil cases are first handled by District Courts. There are eight High Courts in Japan: the Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya, Hiroshima, Fukuoka, Sendai, Sapporo, and Takamatsu High Courts.[79]\n\n\n\n### Penal system[edit]\n\n\nThe **Penal system of Japan** (矯正施設) is operated by the Ministry of Justice. It is part of the criminal justice system, and is intended to resocialize, reform, and rehabilitate offenders. The ministry's Correctional Bureau administers the adult prison system, the juvenile correctional system, and three of the women's guidance homes,[80] while the Rehabilitation Bureau operates the probation and the parole systems.[81]\n\n\n\n## Other government agencies[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Head office of the Bank of Japan, the country's central bank, in Chiyoda, Tokyo\nThe Cabinet Public Affairs Office's Government Directory also listed a number of government agencies that are more independent from executive ministries.[82] The list for these types of agencies can be seen below. \n\n\n\n* Japan National Tourism Organisation (JNTO)\n* Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA)\n* Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO)\n* The Japan Foundation\n* Bank of Japan\n* Japan Mint\n* National Research Bureau of Brewing (NRIB)\n* State Guest Houses (Akasaka Palace, Kyoto State Guest House)\n* National Archives of Japan\n* National Women's Education Centre\n* Japan Broadcasting Corporation (NHK)\n* National Institutes for Cultural Heritage\n* Japan Arts Council\n* Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)\n* Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA)\n* Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST)\n* Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC)\n* National Institute for Materials Science (JIMS)\n* Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA)\n* New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organisation (NEDO)\n* National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID)\n* The Japan Institute for Labour Policy and Training\n\n\n## Local government[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Administrative divisions of Japan\n\n\n| Administrative divisionsof Japan |\n| --- |\n| \nPrefectural |\n| Prefectures |\n| \nSub-prefectural |\n| * Subprefectures\n |\n| Municipal |\n| * Designated cities\n* Core cities\n* Special cities\n* Cities (List)\n* Special wards (Tokyo)\n* Towns\n* Villages\n |\n| \nSub-municipal |\n| * Wards\n |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\nAccording to Article 92 of the Constitution, the local governments of Japan (地方公共団体) are local public entities whose body and functions are defined by law in accordance with the principle of local autonomy.[83][84] The main law that defines them is the Local Autonomy Law.[85][86]　They are given limited executive and legislative powers by the Constitution. Governors, mayors and members of assemblies are constitutionally elected by the residents.\n\n\nThe Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications intervenes significantly in local government, as do other ministries. This is done chiefly financially because many local government jobs need funding initiated by national ministries. This is dubbed as the \"thirty-percent autonomy\".[87]\n\n\nThe result of this power is a high level of organizational and policy standardization among the different local jurisdictions allowing them to preserve the uniqueness of their prefecture, city, or town. Some of the more collectivist jurisdictions, such as Tokyo and Kyoto, have experimented with policies in such areas as social welfare that later were adopted by the national government.[87]\n\n\n\n### Local authorities[edit]\n\n\nJapan is divided into forty-seven administrative divisions, the prefectures are: one metropolitan district (Tokyo), two urban prefectures (Kyoto and Osaka), forty-three rural prefectures, and one \"district\", Hokkaidō. Large cities are subdivided into wards, and further split into towns, or precincts, or subprefectures and counties.\n\n\nCities are self-governing units administered independently of the larger jurisdictions within which they are located. In order to attain city status, a jurisdiction must have at least 500,000 inhabitants, 60 percent of whom are engaged in urban occupations. There are self-governing towns outside the cities as well as precincts of urban wards. Like the cities, each has its own elected mayor and assembly. Villages are the smallest self-governing entities in rural areas. They often consist of a number of rural hamlets containing several thousand people connected to one another through the formally imposed framework of village administration. Villages have mayors and councils elected to four-year terms.[88][89]\n\n\n\n### Structure[edit]\n\n\nEach jurisdiction has a chief executive, called a governor (知事, *chiji*) in prefectures and a mayor (市町村長, *shichōsonchō*) in municipalities. Most jurisdictions also have a unicameral assembly (議会, *gikai*), although towns and villages may opt for direct governance by citizens in a general assembly (総会, *sōkai*). Both the executive and assembly are elected by popular vote every four years.[90][91][92]\n\n\nLocal governments follow a modified version of the separation of powers used in the national government. An assembly may pass a vote of no confidence in the executive, in which case the executive must either dissolve the assembly within ten days or automatically lose their office. Following the next election, however, the executive remains in office unless the new assembly again passes a no confidence resolution.[85]\n\n\nThe primary methods of local lawmaking are local ordinance (条例, *jōrei*) and local regulations (規則, *kisoku*). Ordinances, similar to statutes in the national system, are passed by the assembly and may impose limited criminal penalties for violations (up to 2 years in prison and/or 1 million yen in fines). Regulations, similar to cabinet orders in the national system, are passed by the executive unilaterally, are superseded by any conflicting ordinances, and may only impose a fine of up to 50,000 yen.[88]\n\n\nLocal governments also generally have multiple committees such as school boards, public safety committees (responsible for overseeing the police), personnel committees, election committees and auditing committees.[93] These may be directly elected or chosen by the assembly, executive or both.[87]\n\n\nScholars have noted that political contestations at the local level tend not to be marked by strong party affiliation or political ideologies when compared to the national level. Moreover, in many local communities candidates from different parties tend to share similiar concerns, e.g., regarding depopulation and how to attract new residents. Analyzing the political discourse among local politicians, Hijino suggests that local politics in depopulated areas is marked by two overarching ideas: \"populationism\" and \"listenism.\" He writes, \"“Populationism” assumes the necessity of maintaining and increasing the number of residents for the future and vitality of the municipality. “Listenism” assumes that no decision can be made unless all parties are consulted adequately, preventing majority decisions taken by elected officials over issues contested by residents. These two ideas, though not fully-fledged ideologies, are assumptions guiding the behavior of political actors in municipalities in Japan when dealing with depopulation.\"[94]\n\n\nAll prefectures are required to maintain departments of general affairs, finance, welfare, health, and labor. Departments of agriculture, fisheries, forestry, commerce, and industry are optional, depending on local needs. The Governor is responsible for all activities supported through local taxation or the national government.[87][91]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Japan portal\n* ![icon](image)Politics portal\n\n\n* Japanese honours system\n* Politics of Japan\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"The World Factbook Japan\".

sovereignty. The Government runs under the framework established by the Constitution of Japan, adopted in 1947. It is a unitary state, containing forty-seven administrative divisions, with the Emperor as its Head of State.[1] His role is ceremonial and he has no powers related to Government.[2] Instead, it is the Cabinet, comprising the Ministers of State and the Prime Minister, that directs and controls the Government and the civil service. The Cabinet has the executive power and is formed by the Prime Minister, who is the Head of Government.[3][4] The Prime Minister is nominated by the National Diet and appointed to office by the Emperor.[5][6]\n\n\nThe National Diet is the legislature, the organ of the Legislative branch. It is bicameral, consisting of two houses with the House of Councilors being the upper house, and the House of Representatives being the lower house. Its members are directly elected by the people, who are the source of sovereignty.[7] It is defined as the supreme organ of sovereignty in the Constitution. The Supreme Court and other lower courts make up the Judicial branch and have all the judicial powers in the state. It has ultimate judicial authority to interpret the Japanese constitution and the power of judicial review. They are independent from the executive and the legislative branches.[8] Judges are nominated or appointed by the Cabinet and never removed by the executive or the legislature except during impeachment.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nBefore The Meiji Restoration, Japan was ruled by the government of a successive military *shōgun*. During this period, effective power of the government resided in the Shōgun, who officially ruled the country in the name of the Emperor.[9] The Shōgun were the hereditary military governors, with their modern rank equivalent to a generalissimo. Although the Emperor was the sovereign who appointed the Shōgun, his roles were ceremonial and he took no part in governing the country.[10] This is often compared to the present role of the Emperor, whose official role is to appoint the Prime Minister.[11]\n\n\n\"Taiseihokan\"（大政奉還）The return of political power to the Emperor (to the Imperial Court) in 1868 meant the resignation of Shōgun Tokugawa Yoshinobu, agreeing to \"be the instrument for carrying out\" the Emperor's orders.[12] This event restored the country to Imperial rule and the proclamation of the Empire of Japan. In 1889, the Meiji Constitution was adopted in a move to strengthen Japan to the level of western nations, resulting in the first parliamentary system in Asia.[13] It provided a form of mixed constitutional-absolute monarchy, with an independent judiciary, based on the Prussian model of the time.[14]\n\n\nA new aristocracy known as the *kazoku* was established. It merged the ancient court nobility of the Heian period, the *kuge*, and the former *daimyō*, feudal lords subordinate to the *shōgun*.[15] It also established the Imperial Diet, consisting of the House of Representatives and the House of Peers. Members of the House of Peers were made up of the Imperial Family, the Kazoku, and those nominated by the Emperor,[16] while members of the House of Representatives were elected by direct male suffrage.[17] Despite clear distinctions between powers of the executive branch and the Emperor in the Meiji Constitution, ambiguity and contradictions in the Constitution eventually led to a political crisis.[18] It also devalued the notion of civilian control over the military, which meant that the military could develop and exercise a great influence on politics.[19]\n\n\nFollowing the end of World War II, the present Constitution of Japan was adopted. It replaced the previous Imperial rule with a form of Western-style liberal democracy.[20]\n\n\nAs of 2020, the Japan Research Institute found the national government is mostly analog, because only 7.5% (4,000 of the 55,000) administrative procedures can be completed entirely online. The rate is 7.8% at the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, 8% at the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, and only 1.3% at the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries.[21]\n\n\nOn 12 February, 2021, Tetsushi Sakamoto was appointed as the Minister of Loneliness to alleviate social isolation and loneliness across different age groups and genders.[22]\n\n\n\n## The Emperor[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko seated in the Chamber of the House of Councillors of the National Diet, with members of the imperial family, the cabinet, and prime minister Naoto Kan giving the government's speech in front of the assembled members of parliament (2010)\nThe Emperor of Japan (天皇) is the head of the Imperial Family and the ceremonial head of state. He is defined by the Constitution to be \"the symbol of the State and of the unity of the people\".[7] However, his role is entirely ceremonial and representative in nature. As explicitly stated in article 4 of the Constitution, he has no powers related to government.[23]\n\n\nArticle 6 of the Constitution of Japan delegates the Emperor the following ceremonial roles:\n\n\n\n1. Appointment of the Prime Minister as designated by the Diet.\n2. Appointment of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court as designated by the Cabinet.\n\n\nWhile the Cabinet is the source of executive power and most of its power is exercised directly by the Prime Minister, several of its powers are exercised through the Emperor. The powers exercised via the Emperor, as stipulated by Article 7 of the Constitution, are:\n\n\n\n1. Promulgation of amendments of the constitution, laws, cabinet orders and treaties.\n\n\n1. Dissolution of the House of Representatives.\n2. Proclamation of general election of members of the Diet.\n3. Attestation of the appointment and dismissal of Ministers of State and other officials as provided for by law, and of full powers and credentials of Ambassadors and Ministers.\n4. Attestation of general and special amnesty, commutation of punishment, reprieve, and restoration of rights.\n5. Awarding of honors.\n6. Attestation of instruments of ratification and other diplomatic documents as provided for by law.\n7. Receiving foreign ambassadors and ministers.\n8. Performance of ceremonial functions.\n\n\nThese powers are exercised in accordance with the binding advice of the Cabinet.\n\n\nThe Emperor is known to hold the nominal ceremonial authority. For example, he is the only person that has the authority to appoint the Prime Minister, even though the Diet has the power to designate the person fitted for the position. One such example can be prominently seen in the 2009 Dissolution of the House of Representatives. The House was expected to be dissolved on the advice of the Prime Minister, but was temporarily unable to do so for the next general election, as both the Emperor and Empress were visiting Canada.[24][25]\n\n\nIn this manner, the Emperor's modern role is often compared to those of the Shogunate period and much of Japan's history, whereby the Emperor held great symbolic authority but had little political power; which is often held by others nominally appointed by the Emperor himself. Today, a legacy has somewhat continued for a retired Prime Minister who still wields considerable power, to be called a *Shadow Shogun* (闇将軍).[26]\n\n\nUnlike his European counterparts, the Emperor is not the source of sovereign power and the government does not act under his name. Instead, the Emperor represents the State and appoints other high officials in the name of the State, in which the Japanese people hold sovereignty.[27] Article 5 of the Constitution, in accordance with the Imperial Household Law, allows a regency to be established in the Emperor's name, should the Emperor be unable to perform his duties.[28]\n\n\nOn November 20, 1989, the Supreme Court ruled it doesn't have judicial power over the Emperor.[29]\n\n\nThe Imperial House of Japan is said to be the oldest continuing hereditary monarchy in the world.[30] According to the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, Japan was founded by the Imperial House in 660 BC by Emperor Jimmu (神武天皇).[31] Emperor Jimmu was the first Emperor of Japan and the ancestor of all of the Emperors that followed.[32] He is, according to Japanese mythology, the direct descendant of Amaterasu (天照大御神), the sun goddess of the native Shinto religion, through Ninigi, his great-grandfather.[33][34]\n\n\nThe **Current Emperor of Japan** (今上天皇) is Naruhito. He was officially enthroned on May 1, 2019, following the abdication of his father.[35][36] He is styled as *His Imperial Majesty* (天皇陛下), and his reign bears the era name of **Reiwa** (令和). Fumihito is the heir presumptive to the Chrysanthemum Throne.\n\n\n\n## Executive[edit]\n\n\nThe **Executive branch** of Japan is headed by the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister is the head of the Cabinet, and is designated by the legislative organ, the National Diet.[5] The Cabinet consists of the Ministers of State and may be appointed or dismissed by the Prime Minister at any time.[4] Explicitly defined to be the source of executive power, it is in practice, however, mainly exercised by the Prime Minister. The practice of its powers is responsible to the Diet, and as a whole, should the Cabinet lose confidence and support to be in office by the Diet, the Diet may dismiss the Cabinet *en masse* with a motion of no confidence.[37]\n\n\n\n### Prime Minister[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Crest of the Prime Minister of Japan\nThe **Prime Minister of Japan** (内閣総理大臣) is designated by the National Diet and serves a term of four years or less; with no limits imposed on the number of terms the Prime Minister may hold. The Prime Minister heads the Cabinet and exercises \"control and supervision\" of the executive branch, and is the head of government and commander-in-chief of the Japan Self-Defense Forces.[38] The prime minister is vested with the power to present bills to the Diet, to sign laws, to declare a state of emergency, and may also dissolve the Diet's House of Representatives at will.[39] The prime minister presides over the Cabinet and appoints, or dismisses, the other Cabinet ministers.[4]\n\n\nBoth houses of the National Diet designates the Prime Minister with a ballot cast under the run-off system. Under the Constitution, should both houses not agree on a common candidate, then a joint committee is allowed to be established to agree on the matter; specifically within a period of ten days, exclusive of the period of recess.[40] However, if both houses still do not agree to each other, the decision made by the House of Representatives is deemed to be that of the National Diet.[40] Upon designation, the Prime Minister is presented with their commission, and then formally appointed to office by the Emperor.[6]\n\n\nAs a candidate designated by the Diet, the prime minister is required to report to the Diet whenever demanded.[41] The prime minister must also be both a civilian and a member of either house of the Diet.[42]\n\n\n\nFor a list of prime ministers prior to 2001, see List of prime ministers of Japan.\n\n\n\n| No. | Name (English) | Name (Japanese) | Gender | Took office | Left office | Term | Cabinets\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | Junichiro Koizumi | 小泉 純一郎\n | Male\n | April 26, 2001\n | September 26, 2006\n | 5 years, 153 days\n | 87th: Koizumi I (R1) (R2)88th: Koizumi II (R)89th: Koizumi III (R) |\n| 2\n | Shinzo Abe | 安倍 晋三\n | Male\n | September 26, 2006\n | September 26, 2007\n | 1 year, 0 days\n | 90th: S.

The members of the Cabinet are appointed by the Prime Minister, and under the Cabinet Law, the number of members of the Cabinet appointed, excluding the Prime Minister, must be fourteen or less, but may only be increased to nineteen should a special need arise.[43][44] Article 68 of the Constitution states that all members of the Cabinet must be civilians and the majority of them must be chosen from among the members of either house of the National Diet.[45] The precise wording leaves an opportunity for the Prime Minister to appoint some non-elected Diet officials.[46] The Cabinet is required to resign *en masse* while still continuing its functions, till the appointment of a new Prime Minister, when the following situation arises:\n\n\n\n1. The Diet's House of Representatives passes a non-confidence resolution, or rejects a confidence resolution, unless the House of Representatives is dissolved within the next ten days.\n2. When there is a vacancy in the post of the Prime Minister, or upon the first convocation of the Diet after a general election of the members of the House of Representatives.\n\n\nConceptually deriving legitimacy from the Diet, whom it is responsible to, the Cabinet exercises its power in two different ways. In practice, much of its power is exercised by the Prime Minister, while others are exercised nominally by the Emperor.[3]\n\n\nArticle 73 of the Constitution of Japan expects the Cabinet to perform the following functions, in addition to general administration:\n\n\n\n1. Administer the law faithfully; conduct affairs of state.\n2. Manage foreign affairs.\n3. Conclude treaties. However, it shall obtain prior or, depending on circumstances, subsequent approval of the Diet.\n4. Administer the civil service, in accordance with standards established by law.\n5. Prepare the budget, and present it to the Diet.\n6. Enact cabinet orders in order to execute the provisions of this Constitution and of the law. However, it cannot include penal provisions in such cabinet orders unless authorized by such law.\n7. Decide on general amnesty, special amnesty, commutation of punishment, reprieve, and restoration of rights.\n\n\nUnder the Constitution, all laws and cabinet orders must be signed by the competent Minister and countersigned by the Prime Minister, before being formally promulgated by the Emperor. Also, all members of the Cabinet cannot be subject to legal action without the consent of the Prime Minister; however, without impairing the right to take legal action.[47]\n\n\n\nFor an updated list of members of the Cabinet, see Current Cabinet of Japan.\n\nMain article: Current Japanese cabinet\n\nAs of 14 December 2023,[update] the makeup of the Cabinet:[48]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|

Building\n![](image)Politics of the Constitution of JapanMain article: Ministries of Japan\n\nThe **ministries of Japan** (中央省庁, *Chuo shōcho*) consist of eleven executive ministries and the Cabinet Office. Each ministry is headed by a Minister of State, which are mainly senior legislators, and are appointed from among the members of the Cabinet by the Prime Minister. The Cabinet Office, formally headed by the Prime Minister, is an agency that handles the day-to-day affairs of the Cabinet. The ministries are the most influential part of the daily-exercised executive power, and since few ministers serve for more than a year or so necessary to grab hold of the organisation, most of its power lies within the senior bureaucrats.[49]\n\n\nBelow is a series of ministry-affiliated government agencies and bureaus responsible for government procedures and activities as of 23 August 2022.[50]\n\n\n\n* Cabinet Office\n\t+ National Public Safety Commission\n\t+ National Police Agency\n\t+ Consumer Affairs Agency\n\t+ Financial Services Agency\n\t+ Fair Trade Commission\n\t+ Food Safety Commission\n\t+ Personal Information Protection Commission\n\t+ Imperial Household Agency\n\t+ Gender Equality Bureau\n\t+ Council on Economic and Fiscal Policy\n\t+ Atomic Energy Commission\n\t+ International Peace Cooperation\n\t+ Council for Science, Technology and Innovation\n\t+ Headquarters for Ocean Policy\n\t+ Northern Territories Affairs Administration\n\t+ Public Relations Office of the Government of Japan\n* Cabinet Secretariat\n\t+ National Information Security Centre\n\t+ National Personnel Authority\n\t+ Coordination Office of Measures on Emerging Infectious Diseases\n\t+ Headquarters for the Abduction Issue\n\t+ Cabinet Legislation Bureau\n\t+ Office of Policy Planning and Coordination on Territory and Sovereignty\n\n\n* Reconstruction Agency\n* Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications\n\t+ Environmental Dispute Coordination Commission\n\t+ Fire and Disaster Management Agency\n* Ministry of Justice\n\t+ Public Security Examination Commission\n\t+ Public Security Intelligence Agency\n\t+ Public Prosecutors Office\n\t+ Immigration Services Agency\n* Ministry of Foreign Affairs\n* Ministry of Finance\n\t+ National Tax Agency\n\t+ Japan Customs\n* Ministry of Defense\n\t+ Acquisition, Technology and Logistics Agency\n\t+ Japan Self-Defence Forces (Ground / Maritime / Air)\n\t+ Joint Staff\n* Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT)\n\t+ Education Policy Bureau\n\t+ Elementary and Secondary Education Bureau\n\t+ Higher Education Bureau\n\t+ Science and Technology Policy Bureau\n\t+ Research Promotion Bureau\n\t+ Agency for Cultural Affairs\n\t+ Japan Sports Agency\n\t+ The Japan Art Academy\n\t+ National Institute for Educational Policy Research\n\t+ National Institute of Science and Technology Policy\n\t+ The Japan Academy\n\t+ Headquarters for Earthquake Research Promotion\n\t+ Japanese National Commission for UNESCO\n* Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare\n\t+ Pension Service\n\t+ Central Labour Relations Commission\n\n\n* Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries\n\t+ Fisheries Agency\n\t+ Forestry Agency\n* Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI)\n\t+ Agency for Natural Resources and Energy\n\t+ Small and Medium Enterprise Agency\n\t+ Japan Patent Office\n\n\n* Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT)\n\t+ Japan Transport Safety Board\n\t+ Japan Tourism Agency\n\t+ Japan Meteorological Agency\n\t+ Japan Coast Guard\n* Ministry of the Environment\n\t+ Nuclear Regulation Authority\n* Board of Audit\n\n\n## Legislative[edit]\n\n\n![](image)National Diet Building, Nagatachō, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo\nMain article: National Diet\n\nThe **Legislative branch** organ of Japan is the **National Diet** (国会). It is a bicameral legislature, composing of a lower house, the House of Representatives, and an upper house, the House of Councillors. Empowered by the Constitution to be \"the highest organ of State power\" and the only \"sole law-making organ of the State\", its houses are both directly elected under a parallel voting system and is ensured by the Constitution to have no discrimination on the qualifications of each members; whether be it based on \"race, creed, sex, social status, family origin, education, property or income\". The National Diet, therefore, reflects the sovereignty of the people; a principle of popular sovereignty whereby the supreme power lies within, in this case, the Japanese people.[7][51]\n\n\nThe Diet responsibilities includes the making of laws, the approval of the annual national budget, the approval of the conclusion of treaties and the selection of the Prime Minister. In addition, it has the power to initiate draft constitutional amendments, which, if approved, are to be presented to the people for ratification in a referendum before being promulgated by the Emperor, in the name of the people.[52] The Constitution also enables both houses to conduct investigations in relation to government, demand the presence and testimony of witnesses, and the production of records, as well as allowing either house of the Diet to demand the presence of the Prime Minister or the other Minister of State, in order to give answers or explanations whenever so required.[41] The Diet is also able to impeach Court judges convicted of criminal or irregular conduct. The Constitution, however, does not specify the voting methods, the number of members of each house, and all other matters pertaining to the method of election of the each members, and are thus, allowed to be determined for by law.[53]\n\n\nUnder the provisions of the Constitution and by law, all adults aged over 18 are eligible to vote, with a secret ballot and a universal suffrage, and those elected have certain protections from apprehension while the Diet is in session.[54] Speeches, debates, and votes cast in the Diet also enjoy parliamentary privileges. Each house is responsible for disciplining its own members, and all deliberations are public unless two-thirds or more of those members present passes a resolution agreeing it otherwise. The Diet also requires the presence of at least one-third of the membership of either house in order to constitute a quorum.[55] All decisions are decided by a majority of those present, unless otherwise stated by the Constitution, and in the case of a tie, the presiding officer has the right to decide the issue. A member cannot be expelled, however, unless a majority of two-thirds or more of those members present passes a resolution therefor.[56]\n\n\nUnder the Constitution, at least one session of the Diet must be convened each year. The Cabinet can also, at will, convoke extraordinary sessions of the Diet and is required to, when a quarter or more of the total members of either house demands it.[57] During an election, only the House of Representatives is dissolved. The House of Councillors is however, not dissolved but only closed, and may, in times of national emergency, be convoked for an emergency session.[58] The Emperor both convokes the Diet and dissolves the House of Representatives, but only does so on the advice of the Cabinet.\n\n\nFor bills to become Law, they are to be first passed by both houses of the National Diet, signed by the Ministers of State, countersigned by the Prime Minister, and then finally promulgated by the Emperor; however, without specifically giving the Emperor the power to oppose legislation.\n\n\n\n### House of Representatives[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Chamber of the House of Representatives\nThe **House of Representatives of Japan** (衆議院) is the Lower house, with the members of the house being elected once every four years, or when dissolved, for a four-year term.[59] As of November 18, 2017, it has 465 members. Of these, 176 members are elected from 11 multi-member constituencies by a party-list system of proportional representation, and 289 are elected from single-member constituencies. 233 seats are required for majority. The House of Representatives is the more powerful house out of the two, it is able to override vetoes on bills imposed by the House of Councillors with a two-thirds majority. It can, however, be dissolved by the Prime Minister at will.[39] Members of the house must be of Japanese nationality; those aged 18 years and older may vote, while those aged 25 years and older may run for office in the lower house.[54]\n\n\nThe legislative powers of the House of Representatives is considered to be more powerful than that of the House of Councillors. While the House of Councillors has the ability to veto most decisions made by the House of Representatives, some however, can only be delayed. This includes the legislation of treaties, the budget, and the selection of the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister, and collectively his Cabinet, can in turn, however, dissolve the House of Representatives whenever intended.[39] While the House of Representatives is considered to be officially dissolved upon the preparation of the document, the House is only formally dissolved by the dissolution ceremony.[60] The dissolution ceremony of the House is as follows:[61]\n\n\n\n1. The document is rubber stamped by the Emperor, and wrapped in a purple silk cloth; an indication of a document of state act, done on behalf of the people.\n2. The document is passed on to the Chief Cabinet Secretary at the House of Representatives President's reception room.\n3. The document is taken to the Chamber for preparation by the General-Secretary.\n4. The General-Secretary prepares the document for reading by the Speaker.\n5. The Speaker of the House of Representatives promptly declares the dissolution of the House.\n6. The House of Representatives is formally dissolved.\n\n\nIt is customary that, upon the dissolution of the House, members will shout the **Three Cheers of Banzai** (萬歲).[60][62]\n\n\n\n### House of Councillors[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Chamber of the House of Councillors\nThe **House of Councillors of Japan** (参議院) is the Upper house, with half the members of the house being elected once every three years, for a six-year term. As of November 18, 2017, it has 242 members. Of these, 73 are elected from the 47 prefectural districts, by single non-transferable votes, and 48 are elected from a nationwide list by proportional representation with open lists. The House of Councillors cannot be dissolved by the Prime Minister.[58] Members of the house must be of Japanese nationality; those aged 18 years and older may vote, while those aged 30 years and older may run for office in the upper house.[54]\n\n\nAs the House of Councillors can veto a decision made by the House of Representatives, the House of Councillors can cause the House of Representatives to reconsider its decision. The House of Representatives however, can still insist on its decision by overriding the veto by the House of Councillors with a two-thirds majority of its members present. Each year, and when required, the National Diet is convoked at the House of Councillors, on the advice of the Cabinet, for an extra or an ordinary session, by the Emperor. A short speech is, however, usually first made by the Speaker of the House of Representatives before the Emperor proceeds to convoke the Diet with his Speech from the throne.[63]\n\n\n\n## Judicial[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Supreme Court Building, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo\n![](image)Tokyo High Court Building\nMain article: Judicial system of Japan\n\nThe **Judicial branch** of Japan consists of the Supreme Court, and four other lower courts; the High Courts, District Courts, Family Courts and Summary Courts.[64] Divided into four basic tiers, the Court's independence from the executive and legislative branches are guaranteed by the Constitution, and is stated as: \"no extraordinary tribunal shall be established, nor shall any organ or agency of the Executive be given final judicial power\"; a feature known as the Separation of Powers.[8] Article 76 of the Constitution states that all the Court judges are independent in the exercise of their own conscience and that they are only bounded by the Constitution and the laws.[65] Court judges are removable only by public impeachment, and can only be removed, without impeachment, when they are judicially declared mentally or physically incompetent to perform their duties.[66] The Constitution also explicitly denies any power for executive organs or agencies to administer disciplinary actions against judges.[66] However, a Supreme Court judge may be dismissed by a majority in a referendum; of which, must occur during the first general election of the National Diet's House of Representatives following the judge's appointment, and also the first general election for every ten years lapse thereafter.[67] Trials must be conducted, with judgment declared, publicly, unless the Court \"unanimously determines publicity to be dangerous to public order or morals\"; with the exception for trials of political offenses, offenses involving the press, and cases wherein the rights of people as guaranteed by the Constitution, which cannot be deemed and conducted privately.[68] Court judges are appointed by the Cabinet, in attestation of the Emperor, while the Chief Justice is appointed by the Emperor, after being nominated by the Cabinet; which in practice, known to be under the recommendation of the former Chief Justice.[69]\n\n\nThe Legal system in Japan has been historically influenced by Chinese law; developing independently during the Edo period through texts such as *Kujikata Osadamegaki*.[70] It has, however, changed during the Meiji Restoration, and is now largely based on the European civil law; notably, the civil code based on the German model still remains in effect.[71] A quasi-jury system has recently came into use, and the legal system also includes a bill of rights since May 3, 1947.[72] The collection of Six Codes makes up the main body of the Japanese statutory law.[71]\n\n\nAll Statutory Laws in Japan are required to be rubber stamped by the Emperor with the **Privy Seal of Japan** (天皇御璽), and no Law can take effect without the Cabinet's signature, the Prime Minister's countersignature and the Emperor's promulgation.[73][74][75][76][77]\n\n\n\n### Supreme Court[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Building of the Supreme Court of Japan\nThe **Supreme Court of Japan** (最高裁判所) is the court of last resort and has the power of Judicial review; as defined by the Constitution to be \"the court of last resort with power to determine the constitutionality of any law, order, regulation or official act\".[78] The Supreme Court is also responsible for nominating judges to lower courts and determining judicial procedures. It also oversees the judicial system, overseeing activities of public prosecutors, and disciplining judges and other judicial personnel.[79]\n\n\n\n### High Courts[edit]\n\n\nThe **High Courts of Japan** (高等裁判所) has the jurisdiction to hear appeals to judgments rendered by District Courts and Family Courts, excluding cases under the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. Criminal appeals are directly handled by the High Courts, but Civil cases are first handled by District Courts. There are eight High Courts in Japan: the Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya, Hiroshima, Fukuoka, Sendai, Sapporo, and Takamatsu High Courts.[79]\n\n\n\n### Penal system[edit]\n\n\nThe **Penal system of Japan** (矯正施設) is operated by the Ministry of Justice. It is part of the criminal justice system, and is intended to resocialize, reform, and rehabilitate offenders. The ministry's Correctional Bureau administers the adult prison system, the juvenile correctional system, and three of the women's guidance homes,[80] while the Rehabilitation Bureau operates the probation and the parole systems.[81]\n\n\n\n## Other government agencies[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Head office of the Bank of Japan, the country's central bank, in Chiyoda, Tokyo\nThe Cabinet Public Affairs Office's Government Directory also listed a number of government agencies that are more independent from executive ministries.[82] The list for these types of agencies can be seen below. \n\n\n\n* Japan National Tourism Organisation (JNTO)\n* Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA)\n* Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO)\n* The Japan Foundation\n* Bank of Japan\n* Japan Mint\n* National Research Bureau of Brewing (NRIB)\n* State Guest Houses (Akasaka Palace, Kyoto State Guest House)\n* National Archives of Japan\n* National Women's Education Centre\n* Japan Broadcasting Corporation (NHK)\n* National Institutes for Cultural Heritage\n* Japan Arts Council\n* Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)\n* Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA)\n* Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST)\n* Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC)\n* National Institute for Materials Science (JIMS)\n* Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA)\n* New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organisation (NEDO)\n* National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID)\n* The Japan Institute for Labour Policy and Training\n\n\n## Local government[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Administrative divisions of Japan\n\n\n| Administrative divisionsof Japan |\n| --- |\n| \nPrefectural |\n| Prefectures |\n| \nSub-prefectural |\n| * Subprefectures\n |\n| Municipal |\n| * Designated cities\n* Core cities\n* Special cities\n* Cities (List)\n* Special wards (Tokyo)\n* Towns\n* Villages\n |\n| \nSub-municipal |\n| * Wards\n |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\nAccording to Article 92 of the Constitution, the local governments of Japan (地方公共団体) are local public entities whose body and functions are defined by law in accordance with the principle of local autonomy.[83][84] The main law that defines them is the Local Autonomy Law.[85][86]　They are given limited executive and legislative powers by the Constitution. Governors, mayors and members of assemblies are constitutionally elected by the residents.\n\n\nThe Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications intervenes significantly in local government, as do other ministries. This is done chiefly financially because many local government jobs need funding initiated by national ministries. This is dubbed as the \"thirty-percent autonomy\".[87]\n\n\nThe result of this power is a high level of organizational and policy standardization among the different local jurisdictions allowing them to preserve the uniqueness of their prefecture, city, or town. Some of the more collectivist jurisdictions, such as Tokyo and Kyoto, have experimented with policies in such areas as social welfare that later were adopted by the national government.[87]\n\n\n\n### Local authorities[edit]\n\n\nJapan is divided into forty-seven administrative divisions, the prefectures are: one metropolitan district (Tokyo), two urban prefectures (Kyoto and Osaka), forty-three rural prefectures, and one \"district\", Hokkaidō. Large cities are subdivided into wards, and further split into towns, or precincts, or subprefectures and counties.\n\n\nCities are self-governing units administered independently of the larger jurisdictions within which they are located. In order to attain city status, a jurisdiction must have at least 500,000 inhabitants, 60 percent of whom are engaged in urban occupations. There are self-governing towns outside the cities as well as precincts of urban wards. Like the cities, each has its own elected mayor and assembly. Villages are the smallest self-governing entities in rural areas. They often consist of a number of rural hamlets containing several thousand people connected to one another through the formally imposed framework of village administration. Villages have mayors and councils elected to four-year terms.[88][89]\n\n\n\n### Structure[edit]\n\n\nEach jurisdiction has a chief executive, called a governor (知事, *chiji*) in prefectures and a mayor (市町村長, *shichōsonchō*) in municipalities. Most jurisdictions also have a unicameral assembly (議会, *gikai*), although towns and villages may opt for direct governance by citizens in a general assembly (総会, *sōkai*). Both the executive and assembly are elected by popular vote every four years.[90][91][92]\n\n\nLocal governments follow a modified version of the separation of powers used in the national government. An assembly may pass a vote of no confidence in the executive, in which case the executive must either dissolve the assembly within ten days or automatically lose their office. Following the next election, however, the executive remains in office unless the new assembly again passes a no confidence resolution.[85]\n\n\nThe primary methods of local lawmaking are local ordinance (条例, *jōrei*) and local regulations (規則, *kisoku*). Ordinances, similar to statutes in the national system, are passed by the assembly and may impose limited criminal penalties for violations (up to 2 years in prison and/or 1 million yen in fines). Regulations, similar to cabinet orders in the national system, are passed by the executive unilaterally, are superseded by any conflicting ordinances, and may only impose a fine of up to 50,000 yen.[88]\n\n\nLocal governments also generally have multiple committees such as school boards, public safety committees (responsible for overseeing the police), personnel committees, election committees and auditing committees.[93] These may be directly elected or chosen by the assembly, executive or both.[87]\n\n\nScholars have noted that political contestations at the local level tend not to be marked by strong party affiliation or political ideologies when compared to the national level. Moreover, in many local communities candidates from different parties tend to share similiar concerns, e.g., regarding depopulation and how to attract new residents. Analyzing the political discourse among local politicians, Hijino suggests that local politics in depopulated areas is marked by two overarching ideas: \"populationism\" and \"listenism.\" He writes, \"“Populationism” assumes the necessity of maintaining and increasing the number of residents for the future and vitality of the municipality. “Listenism” assumes that no decision can be made unless all parties are consulted adequately, preventing majority decisions taken by elected officials over issues contested by residents. These two ideas, though not fully-fledged ideologies, are assumptions guiding the behavior of political actors in municipalities in Japan when dealing with depopulation.\"[94]\n\n\nAll prefectures are required to maintain departments of general affairs, finance, welfare, health, and labor. Departments of agriculture, fisheries, forestry, commerce, and industry are optional, depending on local needs. The Governor is responsible for all activities supported through local taxation or the national government.[87][91]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Japan portal\n* ![icon](image)Politics portal\n\n\n* Japanese honours system\n* Politics of Japan\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"The World Factbook Japan\".

It consists of the Federal Chancellor and cabinet ministers. The fundamentals of the cabinet's organisation, as well as the method of its election and appointment, along with the procedure for its dismissal, are set down in articles 62 through 69 of the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany (*Grundgesetz*).\n\n\nIn contrast to the system under the Weimar Republic, the *Bundestag* may only dismiss the Chancellor with a constructive vote of no confidence (electing a new Chancellor at the same time) and can thereby only choose to dismiss the Chancellor with their entire cabinet and not simply individual ministers. These procedures and mechanisms were put in place by the authors of the Basic Law to both prevent another dictatorship and to ensure that there will not be a political vacuum left by the removal of Chancellor through a vote of confidence and the failure to elect a new one in their place, as had happened during the Weimar period with the *Reichstag* removing Chancellors but failing to agree on the election of a new one.\n\n\nIf the Chancellor loses a simple confidence motion (without the election of a new Chancellor by the *Bundestag*), this does not force them out of office, but allows the Chancellor, if they wish to do so, to ask the President of Germany for the dissolution of the *Bundestag*, triggering a snap election within 60 days (this happened in 1972, 1983, and 2005), or to ask the President to declare a legislative state of emergency, which allows the cabinet to use a simplified legislative procedure, in which bills proposed by the cabinet only need the consent of the *Bundesrat* (as yet, this has never been applied). The President is, however, not bound to follow the Chancellor's request in both cases.\n\n\nThe Chancellor and the other members of the cabinet are allowed to be also members of the *Bundestag* (though they are not required to be).\n\n\n\n\n## Process of nomination and appointment[edit]\n\n\nThe Chancellor is elected by the federal parliament (*Bundestag*) on proposal of the President of Germany with a majority of all members of the *Bundestag* (*Chancellor-majority*). However, the *Bundestag* is free to disregard the President's proposal (which has, as of 2023, never happened), in which case the parliament may within 14 days hold further ballots and try to elect another individual, which the parties in the *Bundestag* can now propose themselves, to the post with the same so called Chancellor-majority, whom the President is then obliged to appoint. If the *Bundestag* fails to do so, a last ballot will be held on the 15th day (again the parties in the *Bundestag* may field candidates): If an individual is elected with the Chancellor-majority, the President must appoint them as Chancellor. If not, the President is free to either appoint the individual, who received a plurality of votes on this last ballot, as Chancellor or to dissolve the *Bundestag* and call a snap election within 60 days.\n\n\nFollowing their election in the *Bundestag*, the Chancellor-elect will visit Bellevue Palace, the residence of the President, to receive a certificate of appointment. This is the moment, the elected individual actually enters office. After this short appointment-ceremony, the Chancellor returns to the *Bundestag*, in order to take the oath of office. Having taken the oath, the Chancellor will once again visit Bellevue Palace, this time joined by the individuals the Chancellor intends to propose as members of the cabinet. The President will officially appoint the new cabinet members, again handing over certificates of appointment. After the ministers are appointed, they return to the *Bundestag* and take their oaths of office, completing the appointment-process.\n\n\n\n## Functioning[edit]\n\n\nThe Chancellor is the chief executive leader. Therefore, the whole cabinet's tenure is linked to the Chancellor's tenure: The Chancellor's (and the cabinet's) term automatically ends, if a newly elected *Bundestag* sits for the first time, if they are replaced by a *constructive vote of no confidence*, or if the Chancellor resigns or dies. Nevertheless, apart from the case of a *constructive vote of no confidence*, which by nature instantly invests a new Chancellor (and a new cabinet), the Chancellor and their ministers stay in office as an acting cabinet on the President's request, until the *Bundestag* has elected a new Chancellor. An acting cabinet and its members have (theoretically) the same powers as an ordinary cabinet, but the Chancellor may not ask the *Bundestag* for a motion of confidence or ask the President for the appointment of new ministers. If an acting minister leaves the cabinet, another member of government has to take over their department.\n\n\nThe Chancellor is responsible for guiding the cabinet and deciding its political direction (**Richtlinienkompetenz**). According to the principle of departmentalization (**Ressortprinzip**), the cabinet ministers are free to carry out their duties independently within the boundaries set by the Chancellor's political directives. The Chancellor may at any time ask the President to dismiss a minister or to appoint a new minister; the President's appointment is only a formality, he may not refuse a Chancellor's request for dismissal or appointment of a minister. The Chancellor also decides the scope of each minister's duties and can at his own discretion nominate ministers heading a department and so-called ministers for special affairs without an own department. A Chancellor can also lead a department; this is not usual, but it has occurred on three occasions with Konrad Adenauer and Willy Brandt also serving as Minister of Foreign Affairs, while Helmut Schmidt held the post of Minister of Defence.\n\n\nThe Chancellor's freedom to shape his cabinet is only limited by some constitutional provisions: The Chancellor has to appoint a Minister of Defence, a Minister of Economic Affairs and a Minister of Justice and is implicitly forbidden to head one of these departments himself, as the constitution invests these ministers with some special powers. For example, the Minister of Defence is commander-in-chief during peacetime (only in wartime does the Chancellor becomes supreme commander), the Minister of Economic Affairs may veto decisions by the Federal Cartel Office and the Minister of Justice appoints and dismisses the Public Prosecutor General. If two ministers disagree on a particular point, the cabinet resolves the conflict by a majority vote (**Kollegialprinzip** or principle of deference) or the Chancellor decides the case themselves. This often depends on the Chancellor's governing style.\n\n\nThe Chancellor has to appoint one of the cabinet ministers as Vice Chancellor, who may deputise for the Chancellor in their absence. In coalition governments the Vice Chancellor is usually the highest ranking minister of the second biggest coalition party. If the Chancellor dies or is unwilling or unable to act as Chancellor after the end of their term, until a new Chancellor has been elected, the Vice Chancellor becomes Acting Chancellor until the election of a new Chancellor by the *Bundestag*, who then has to form a new government. (To date, this has happened once: On 7 May 1974 Chancellor Willy Brandt resigned and declared his refusal to act as Chancellor until his successor's election. Vice Chancellor Walter Scheel was appointed as Acting Chancellor and served until the election of Helmut Schmidt on 16 May.)\n\n\nThe Chancellor is in charge of the government's administrative affairs, which are usually delegated to the Head of staff of the Chancellery, who is usually also appointed as minister for special affairs. Details are laid down in the government's rules for internal procedures (**Geschäftsordnung**). These state, for example, that the cabinet is quorate only if at least half of the ministers including the chair (the Chancellor or in their absence the Vice Chancellor) are present. The cabinet regularly convenes on Wednesday mornings in the Chancellery.\n\n\nAccording to established practice, decisions on important armaments exports are made by the Federal Security Council [de] (**Bundessicherheitsrat**), a cabinet committee chaired by the Chancellor. Pursuant to its (classified) rules of procedure, its sessions are confidential. According to practice, the Federal Government presents an annual report on arms exports, which contains statistical information on export permits issued and gives figures for the types of arms concerned as well as their destination. As a general rule, the Federal Government, if asked, is required to inform the *Bundestag* that the Federal Security Council has approved a given armaments export transaction or not.[1]\n\n\n\n## Current cabinet[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Scholz cabinet\n\nThe current and 24th federal cabinet of Germany has been in office since 8 December 2021.

It consists of the Federal Chancellor and cabinet ministers. The fundamentals of the cabinet's organisation, as well as the method of its election and appointment, along with the procedure for its dismissal, are set down in articles 62 through 69 of the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany (*Grundgesetz*).\n\n\nIn contrast to the system under the Weimar Republic, the *Bundestag* may only dismiss the Chancellor with a constructive vote of no confidence (electing a new Chancellor at the same time) and can thereby only choose to dismiss the Chancellor with their entire cabinet and not simply individual ministers. These procedures and mechanisms were put in place by the authors of the Basic Law to both prevent another dictatorship and to ensure that there will not be a political vacuum left by the removal of Chancellor through a vote of confidence and the failure to elect a new one in their place, as had happened during the Weimar period with the *Reichstag* removing Chancellors but failing to agree on the election of a new one.\n\n\nIf the Chancellor loses a simple confidence motion (without the election of a new Chancellor by the *Bundestag*), this does not force them out of office, but allows the Chancellor, if they wish to do so, to ask the President of Germany for the dissolution of the *Bundestag*, triggering a snap election within 60 days (this happened in 1972, 1983, and 2005), or to ask the President to declare a legislative state of emergency, which allows the cabinet to use a simplified legislative procedure, in which bills proposed by the cabinet only need the consent of the *Bundesrat* (as yet, this has never been applied). The President is, however, not bound to follow the Chancellor's request in both cases.\n\n\nThe Chancellor and the other members of the cabinet are allowed to be also members of the *Bundestag* (though they are not required to be).\n\n\n\n\n## Process of nomination and appointment[edit]\n\n\nThe Chancellor is elected by the federal parliament (*Bundestag*) on proposal of the President of Germany with a majority of all members of the *Bundestag* (*Chancellor-majority*). However, the *Bundestag* is free to disregard the President's proposal (which has, as of 2023, never happened), in which case the parliament may within 14 days hold further ballots and try to elect another individual, which the parties in the *Bundestag* can now propose themselves, to the post with the same so called Chancellor-majority, whom the President is then obliged to appoint. If the *Bundestag* fails to do so, a last ballot will be held on the 15th day (again the parties in the *Bundestag* may field candidates): If an individual is elected with the Chancellor-majority, the President must appoint them as Chancellor. If not, the President is free to either appoint the individual, who received a plurality of votes on this last ballot, as Chancellor or to dissolve the *Bundestag* and call a snap election within 60 days.\n\n\nFollowing their election in the *Bundestag*, the Chancellor-elect will visit Bellevue Palace, the residence of the President, to receive a certificate of appointment. This is the moment, the elected individual actually enters office. After this short appointment-ceremony, the Chancellor returns to the *Bundestag*, in order to take the oath of office. Having taken the oath, the Chancellor will once again visit Bellevue Palace, this time joined by the individuals the Chancellor intends to propose as members of the cabinet. The President will officially appoint the new cabinet members, again handing over certificates of appointment. After the ministers are appointed, they return to the *Bundestag* and take their oaths of office, completing the appointment-process.\n\n\n\n## Functioning[edit]\n\n\nThe Chancellor is the chief executive leader. Therefore, the whole cabinet's tenure is linked to the Chancellor's tenure: The Chancellor's (and the cabinet's) term automatically ends, if a newly elected *Bundestag* sits for the first time, if they are replaced by a *constructive vote of no confidence*, or if the Chancellor resigns or dies. Nevertheless, apart from the case of a *constructive vote of no confidence*, which by nature instantly invests a new Chancellor (and a new cabinet), the Chancellor and their ministers stay in office as an acting cabinet on the President's request, until the *Bundestag* has elected a new Chancellor. An acting cabinet and its members have (theoretically) the same powers as an ordinary cabinet, but the Chancellor may not ask the *Bundestag* for a motion of confidence or ask the President for the appointment of new ministers. If an acting minister leaves the cabinet, another member of government has to take over their department.\n\n\nThe Chancellor is responsible for guiding the cabinet and deciding its political direction (**Richtlinienkompetenz**). According to the principle of departmentalization (**Ressortprinzip**), the cabinet ministers are free to carry out their duties independently within the boundaries set by the Chancellor's political directives. The Chancellor may at any time ask the President to dismiss a minister or to appoint a new minister; the President's appointment is only a formality, he may not refuse a Chancellor's request for dismissal or appointment of a minister. The Chancellor also decides the scope of each minister's duties and can at his own discretion nominate ministers heading a department and so-called ministers for special affairs without an own department. A Chancellor can also lead a department; this is not usual, but it has occurred on three occasions with Konrad Adenauer and Willy Brandt also serving as Minister of Foreign Affairs, while Helmut Schmidt held the post of Minister of Defence.\n\n\nThe Chancellor's freedom to shape his cabinet is only limited by some constitutional provisions: The Chancellor has to appoint a Minister of Defence, a Minister of Economic Affairs and a Minister of Justice and is implicitly forbidden to head one of these departments himself, as the constitution invests these ministers with some special powers. For example, the Minister of Defence is commander-in-chief during peacetime (only in wartime does the Chancellor becomes supreme commander), the Minister of Economic Affairs may veto decisions by the Federal Cartel Office and the Minister of Justice appoints and dismisses the Public Prosecutor General. If two ministers disagree on a particular point, the cabinet resolves the conflict by a majority vote (**Kollegialprinzip** or principle of deference) or the Chancellor decides the case themselves. This often depends on the Chancellor's governing style.\n\n\nThe Chancellor has to appoint one of the cabinet ministers as Vice Chancellor, who may deputise for the Chancellor in their absence. In coalition governments the Vice Chancellor is usually the highest ranking minister of the second biggest coalition party. If the Chancellor dies or is unwilling or unable to act as Chancellor after the end of their term, until a new Chancellor has been elected, the Vice Chancellor becomes Acting Chancellor until the election of a new Chancellor by the *Bundestag*, who then has to form a new government. (To date, this has happened once: On 7 May 1974 Chancellor Willy Brandt resigned and declared his refusal to act as Chancellor until his successor's election. Vice Chancellor Walter Scheel was appointed as Acting Chancellor and served until the election of Helmut Schmidt on 16 May.)\n\n\nThe Chancellor is in charge of the government's administrative affairs, which are usually delegated to the Head of staff of the Chancellery, who is usually also appointed as minister for special affairs. Details are laid down in the government's rules for internal procedures (**Geschäftsordnung**). These state, for example, that the cabinet is quorate only if at least half of the ministers including the chair (the Chancellor or in their absence the Vice Chancellor) are present. The cabinet regularly convenes on Wednesday mornings in the Chancellery.\n\n\nAccording to established practice, decisions on important armaments exports are made by the Federal Security Council [de] (**Bundessicherheitsrat**), a cabinet committee chaired by the Chancellor. Pursuant to its (classified) rules of procedure, its sessions are confidential. According to practice, the Federal Government presents an annual report on arms exports, which contains statistical information on export permits issued and gives figures for the types of arms concerned as well as their destination. As a general rule, the Federal Government, if asked, is required to inform the *Bundestag* that the Federal Security Council has approved a given armaments export transaction or not.[1]\n\n\n\n## Current cabinet[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Scholz cabinet\n\nThe current and 24th federal cabinet of Germany has been in office since 8 December 2021.
