It is organized around shared values of pluralism, liberal democracy, and representative government.[1][2][3] G7 members are the major IMF advanced economies.\n\n\nOriginating from an *ad hoc* gathering of finance ministers in 1973, the G7 has since become a formal, high-profile venue for discussing and coordinating solutions to major global issues, especially in the areas of trade, security, economics, and climate change.[4] Each member's head of government or state, along with the EU's Commission President and European Council President, meet annually at the G7 Summit; other high-ranking officials of the G7 and the EU meet throughout the year. Representatives of other states and international organizations are often invited as guests, with Russia having been a formal member (as part of the G8) from 1997 until its expulsion in 2014.\n\n\nThe G7 is not based on a treaty and has no permanent secretariat or office. It is organized through a presidency that rotates annually among the member states, with the presiding state setting the group's priorities and hosting the summit; Japan presides for 2023.[5] While lacking a legal or institutional basis, the G7 is widely considered to wield significant international influence;[6] it has catalyzed or spearheaded several major global initiatives, including efforts to combat the HIV/AIDS pandemic, provide financial aid to developing countries, and address climate change through the 2015 Paris Agreement.[6][1][7] However, the group has been criticized by observers for its allegedly outdated and limited membership, narrow global representation, and ineffectualness.[8][9][10]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Origins[edit]\n\n\nThe concept of a forum for the capitalist world's major industrialized countries emerged before the 1973 oil crisis. On 25 March 1973, the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, George Shultz, convened an informal gathering of finance ministers from West Germany (Helmut Schmidt), France (Valéry Giscard d'Estaing), and the United Kingdom (Anthony Barber) before an upcoming meeting in Washington, D.C. U.S. President Richard Nixon offered the White House as a venue, and the meeting was subsequently held in its library on the ground floor;[11] the original group of four consequently became known as the \"Library Group\".[12] In mid-1973, at the Spring Meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, Shultz proposed the addition of Japan, which all members accepted.[11] The informal gathering of senior financial officials from the U.S., U.K., West Germany, Japan, and France became known as the \"Group of Five\".[13]\n\n\nIn 1974, all five members endured sudden and often troubled changes in leadership. French President Georges Pompidou abruptly died, leading to a fresh presidential election that was closely won by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing. West German Chancellor Willy Brandt, American President Richard Nixon, and Japanese Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka all resigned due to scandals. In the United Kingdom, a hung election led to a minority government whose subsequent instability prompted another election the same year. Consequently, Nixon's successor, Gerald Ford, proposed a retreat the following year for the group's new leaders to learn about one another.\n\n\n\n### First summit and expansion[edit]\n\n\n![](image)First G6 summit at the Chateau de Rambouillet in November 1975\nAt the initiative of Giscard d'Estaing and his German counterpart, Helmut Schmidt, France hosted a three-day summit in November 1975, inviting the Group of Five plus Italy, forming the \"Group of Six\" (G6).[14] Taking place at the Château de Rambouillet, the meeting focused on several major economic issues, including the oil crisis, the collapse of the Bretton Woods system, and the ongoing global recession.[15] The result was the 15-point \"Declaration of Rambouillet\", which, among other positions, announced the group's united commitment to promoting free trade, multilateralism, cooperation with the developing world, and rapprochement with the Eastern Bloc.[16] The members also established plans for future gatherings to take place regularly every year.\n\n\nIn 1976, British Prime Minister Harold Wilson, who had participated in the first G6 summit, resigned from office; Schmidt and Ford believed the group needed an English speaker with more political experience, and advocated for inviting Pierre Trudeau, who had been Prime Minister of Canada for eight years – significantly longer than any G6 leader. Canada was also the next largest advanced economy after the G6 members.[17] The summit in Dorado, Puerto Rico later that year became the first of the current Group of Seven (G7).[15]\n\n\nIn 1977, the United Kingdom, which hosted that year's summit, invited the European Economic Community to join all G7 summits; beginning in 1981, it has attended every gathering through the president of the European Commission and the leader of the country holding the presidency of the Council of the European Union.[18] Since 2009, the then-newly established position of the President of the European Council, who serves as the Union's principal foreign representative, also regularly attends the summits.\n\n\n\n### Rising profile[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Flags of G7 members as seen on University Avenue, Toronto (September 2016)\nUntil the 1985 Plaza Accord, meetings between the seven governments' finance ministers were not public knowledge. The Accord, which involved only the original Group of Five, was announced the day before it was finalized, with a communiqué issued afterward.[19] The 1980s also marked the G7's expanded concerns beyond macroeconomic issues, namely with respect to international security and conflict; for example, it sought to address the ongoing conflicts between Iran and Iraq and between the Soviet Union and Afghanistan.\n\n\nFollowing the 1994 summit in Naples, Russian officials held separate meetings with leaders of the G7. This informal arrangement was dubbed the \"Political 8\" (P8), colloquially the G7+1. At the invitation of the G7 leaders, Russian President Boris Yeltsin was invited first as a guest observer, and later as a full participant. After the 1997 meeting, Russia was formally invited to the next meeting and formally joined the group in 1998, resulting in the Group of Eight (G8).[15] Russia was an outlier in the group, as it lacked the national wealth and financial weight of other members, had never been a major advanced economy, and was not yet an established liberal democracy.[20][21] Its invitation, made during a difficult transition to a post-communist economy, is believed to have been motivated by a desire to encourage its political and economic reforms and international engagement.\n\n\nRussia's membership was suspended in March 2014 in response to its annexation of Crimea.[22][23][24] Members stopped short of permanently ejecting the country,[25] and in subsequent years expressed an openness or express desire to reinstate Russian participation. In January 2017, Russia announced it would permanently leave the G8, which came into effect June 2018.[26][27] In 2020, U.S. President Donald Trump, backed by Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, advocated for Russia's return; all other members rejected the proposal, and Russia expressed no interest.[28]\n\n\n\n## Renewed calls for expanded membership[edit]\n\n\nThere have been various proposals to expand the G7. The U.S.-based Atlantic Council has held the D-10 Strategy Forum since 2014 with representatives from what it calls \"leading democracies\" which support a \"rules-based democratic order\", consisting of all members of the G7 (including the European Union) plus Australia and South Korea. Several democratic countries – including India, Indonesia, Poland, and Spain – participate as observers.[29] Centered around a similar mandate as the G7, the D-10 has been considered by some analysts to be an alternative to the group;[30] This is also favored by various think tanks and former British leader Boris Johnson.[29]\n\n\nIn 2019 under Putin, Russia had signaled support for the inclusion of China, India, and Turkey if the G7 had reinstated Russian membership.[31]\n\n\nIn 2020 under Trump, the U.S. had signaled support for the inclusion of Australia, Brazil, India, and South Korea, plus the reincorporation of Russia.[32][33] The leaders of the other six G7 members unanimously rejected this proposal.[34]\n\n\nAlso in November 2020, Jared Cohen and Richard Fontaine, writing in Foreign Affairs, suggested that the G7 might be expanded to a \"T-12\" of \"Techno Democracies\". Earlier, in June of that same year, the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence (GPAI) was announced. Something of a spin-out of the G7, founded by members Canada and France, GPAI's initial membership was 15, including both the EU and India, as well as Australia, Mexico, New Zealand, Singapore, Slovenia, and the Republic of Korea.\n\n\nBoris Johnson invited members of Australia and the Republic of Korea to the June 2021 G7 summit.[30] India was also invited to the 2021 summit, with an aim to \"deepen the expertise and experience around the table\" along with the other guests, according to a U.K. government statement.[35]\n\n\nIn 2021, French jurist and consultant Eric Garner de Béville, a member of the *Cercle Montesquieu*, proposed Spain's membership to the G7.[36] American Chargé d'Affaires in Spain, Conrad Tribble, stated that the United States \"enthusiastically supports\" a \"greater\" role of Spanish leadership at the international level.[37]\n\n\nIn 2022, Germany has confirmed it will be inviting India,[38] against rumours to the contrary.[39][40][*needs update*]\n\n\nIn 2023, Japan's prime minister Fumio Kishida invited South Korea, Australia, India, Indonesia, Brazil, Vietnam, Comoros (representing the African Union), the Cook Islands (representing the Pacific Islands Forum) and Ukraine to the 49th summit hosted in Hiroshima.[41][42][43][44][45][46]\n\n\n\n## Activities and initiatives[edit]\n\n\n![G7 is located in Europe](image)![1st](image)\n1st\n![3rd, 10th, 17th](image)\n3rd, 10th, 17th\n![4th, 11th](image)\n4th, 11th\n![6th, 13th](image)\n6th, 13th\n![8th](image)\n8th\n![15th](image)\n15th\n![18th](image)\n18th\n![20th](image)\n20th\n![22nd](image)\n22nd\n![24th](image)\n24th\n![25th](image)\n25th\n![27th](image)\n27th\n![29th](image)\n29th\n![31st](image)\n31st\n![32nd](image)\n32nd\n![33rd](image)\n33rd\n![35th](image)\n35th\n![37th](image)\n37th\n![39th](image)\n39th\n![40th](image)\n40th\n![41st](image)\n41st\n![43rd'](image)\n43rd'\n![45th](image)\n45th\n![47th](image)\n47th\nclass=notpageimage|\nHost venues of G7 summits in Europe\n\nThe G7 was founded primarily to facilitate shared macroeconomic initiatives in response to contemporary economic problems; the first gathering was centered around the Nixon shock, the 1970s energy crisis, and the ensuing global recession.[47] Since 1975, the group has met annually at summits organized and hosted by whichever country occupies the annually-rotating presidency;[48] since 1987, the G7 Finance Ministers have met at least semi-annually, and up to four times a year at stand-alone meetings.[49]\n\n\nBeginning in the 1980s, the G7 broadened its areas of concern to include issues of international security, human rights, and global security; for example, during this period, the G7 concerned itself with the ongoing Iran-Iraq War and Soviet occupation of Afghanistan.[48] In the 1990s, it launched a debt-relief program for the 42 heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC);[50] provided $300 million to help build the Shelter Structure over the damaged reactor at Chernobyl;[51] and established the Financial Stability Forum to help in \"managing the international monetary system\".[52]\n\n\n\n![G7 is located in North America](image)![2nd](image)\n2nd\n![7th](image)\n7th\n![9th](image)\n9th\n![14th](image)\n14th\n![16th](image)\n16th\n![21st](image)\n21st\n![23rd](image)\n23rd\n![28th](image)\n28th\n![30th](image)\n30th\n![36th](image)\n36th\n![38th](image)\n38th\n![44th](image)\n44th\nclass=notpageimage|\nHost venues of G7 summits in North America\n\nAt the turn of the 21st century, the G7 began emphasizing engagement with the developing world. At the 1999 summit, the group helped launch the G20, a similar forum made up of the G7 and the next 13 largest economies (including the European Union), in order to \"promote dialogue between major industrial and emerging market countries\";[52] the G20 has been touted by some of its members as a replacement for the G7.[53] Having previously announced a plan to cancel 90% of bilateral debt for the HIPC, totaling $100 billion, in 2005 the G7 announced debt reductions of \"up to 100%\" to be negotiated on a \"case by case\" basis.[54]\n\n\nFollowing the global financial crisis of 2007–2008, which was the worst of its kind since the 1970s,[55] the G7 met twice in Washington, D.C. in 2008 and in Rome, the following February.[56][57] News media reported that much of the world was looking to the group for leadership and solutions.[58] G7 finance ministers pledged to take \"all necessary steps\" to stem the crisis,[59] devising an \"aggressive action plan\" that included providing publicly funded capital infusions to banks in danger of failing.[60] Some analysts criticized the group for seemingly advocating that individual governments develop individual responses to the recession, rather than cohere around a united effort.[61]\n\n\nIn subsequent years, the G7 has faced several geopolitical challenges that have led some international analysts to question its credibility,[62] or propose its replacement by the G20.[63] On 2 March 2014, the G7 condemned the Russian Federation for its \"violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine\" through its military intervention.[64] The group also announced its commitment to \"mobilize rapid technical assistance to support Ukraine in addressing its macroeconomic, regulatory and anti-corruption challenges\", while adding that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) was best suited to stabilizing the country's finances and economy.[64]\n\n\n\n![G7 is located in Japan](image)![5th, 12th, 19th](image)\n5th, 12th, 19th\n![26th](image)\n26th\n![34th](image)\n34th\n![42nd](image)\n42nd\n![49th](image)\n49th\nclass=notpageimage|\nHost venues of G7 summits in Japan\n\nIn response to Russia's subsequent annexation of Crimea, on 24 March the G7 convened an emergency meeting at the official residence of the Prime Minister of the Netherlands, the Catshuis in The Hague; this location was chosen because all G7 leaders were already present to attend the 2014 Nuclear Security Summit hosted by the Netherlands. This was the first G7 meeting neither taking place in a member state nor having the host leader participating in the meeting.[65] The upcoming G8 summit in Sochi, Russia was moved to Brussels, where the EU was the host. On 5 June 2014 the G7 condemned Moscow for its \"continuing violation\" of Ukraine's sovereignty and stated they were prepared to impose further sanctions on Russia.[66] This meeting was the first since Russia was suspended from the G8,[66] and subsequently it has not been involved in any G7 summit.\n\n\nThe G7 has continued to take a strong stance against Russia's \"destabilising behaviour and malign activities\" in Ukraine and elsewhere around the world, following the joint communique from the June 2021 summit in the U.K.[67] The group also called on Russia to address international cybercrime attacks launched from within its borders, and to investigate the use of chemical weapons on Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny.[67] The June 2021 summit also saw the G7 commit to helping the world recover from the global COVID-19 pandemic (including plans to help vaccinate the entire world); encourage further action against climate change and biodiversity loss; and promote \"shared values\" of pluralism and democracy.[35]\n\n\nIn 2022, G7 leaders were invited to attend an extraordinary summit of NATO called in response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.[68][69]\n\n\n\n### Summit organization[edit]\n\n\nThe annual G7 summit is attended by each member's head of government.[70] The member country holding the G7 presidency is responsible for organizing and hosting the year's summit. The serial annual summits can be parsed chronologically in arguably distinct ways, including as the sequence of host countries for the summits has recurred over time and series.[71] Generally every country hosts the summit once every seven years.[72]\n\n\nBesides a main meeting in June or July, a number of other meetings may take place throughout the year; in 2021 for example, seven tracks existed for finance (4–5 June 2021), environmental (20 and 21 May 2021), health (3–4 June 2021), trade (27–28 May 2021), interior (7–9 September 2021) digital and technology (28–29 April 2021), development (3–5 May 2021) and foreign ministers.[73]\n\n\n\n\n## List of summits[edit]\n\n\n\n\nOverview of G7 summits\n| #\n | Date\n | Host\n | Host leader\n | Location held\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1st | 15–17 November 1975 | ![](image) France | Valéry Giscard d'Estaing | Château de Rambouillet, Yvelines | The first and last G6 summit.\n |\n| 2nd | 27–28 June 1976 | ![](image) United States | Gerald R.

Angola, Denmark, Netherlands, and Spain accepted their invitations for the first time.[79] A record of 11 international organizations were represented in this summit.

North Korea was urged to comply with UN resolutions, and Russian responsibility for the Ukrainian conflict was stressed. Supporting economic activity and ensuring price stability was demanded, while inequalities in trade and gender were called to be challenged. It was agreed to help countries in creating conditions that address the drivers of migration: ending hunger, increasing competitiveness, and advancing global health security.[102][103] |\n| 44th | 8–9 June 2018 | ![](image) Canada[104] | Justin Trudeau | La Malbaie, Québec (Charlevoix)[105] | The summit took place at the Manoir Richelieu. Prime Minister Trudeau announced five themes for Canada's G7 presidency, which began in January 2018.

US President Donald Trump did not agree to the economic section of the final statement.[107] The G7 members also announced to recall sanctions and to be ready to take further restrictive measures against Russian Federation for its failure to implement the Minsk Protocol completely.[108] |\n| 45th | 24–26 August 2019 | ![](image) France[109] | Emmanuel Macron | Biarritz, Pyrénées-Atlantiques | It was agreed at the summit that the World Trade Organization, \"with regard to intellectual property protection, to settle disputes more swiftly and to eliminate unfair trade practices\", \"to simplify regulatory barriers and modernize international taxation within the framework of the OECD\", \"to ensure that Iran never acquires nuclear weapons and to foster peace and stability in the region\", and \"to support a truce in Libya that will lead to a long-term ceasefire\".

The People's Republic of China, according to its data, would be the second-largest with 17.90% of the world net wealth,[130] but is excluded because of its relatively low net wealth per adult and Human Development Index.[20] As of 2021, Crédit Suisse reports the G7 (without the European Union) represents around 53% of the global net wealth;[131] including the EU, the G7 accounts for over 60% of the global net wealth.[131]\n\n\n\n\n\nOverview of G7 members\n| Member\n | Trade mil.

About 300 of those reached the 3 m high and 7 km long security fence surrounding the summit location. The protesters questioned the legitimacy of the G7 to make decisions that could affect the whole world. Authorities had banned demonstrations in the area closest to the summit location and 20,000 police were on duty in Southern Bavaria to keep activists and protesters from interfering with the summit.[134][135]\n\n\n\n### 2018 Trump conflict over tariffs and Russia[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: 44th G7 summit and Russo-Ukrainian War\n\nThe 2018 meeting in Charlevoix, Canada, was marred by fractious negotiations concerning tariffs and Donald Trump's position that Russia should be reinstated to the G7. The Trump administration had just imposed steel and aluminium tariffs on many countries, including European countries that are fellow members of the G7, and Canada, the host country for the 2018 meeting. Trump expressed dismay at Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for holding a press conference in which Canada restated its position on tariffs (a public criticism of Trump's economic policy), and directed his representatives at the meeting not to sign the economic section of the joint communiqué that is typically issued at the conclusion of the meeting.\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel described Trump's behaviour as a \"depressing withdrawal\", while French President Emmanuel Macron invited him \"to be serious\".[136] In the final statement signed by all members except the US, the G7 announced its intention to recall sanctions and to be ready to take further restrictive measures within the next months against the Russian Federation for its failure to completely implement the Minsk Agreement.[108]\n\n\nTrump repeated calls for Russia to be re-admitted to the group at the 2019 meeting in Biarritz, saying it should be included in discussions relating to Iran, Syria, and North Korea. The Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte supported Trump's proposal, Shinzo Abe of Japan was neutral, and the rest of the G7 pushed back against the suggestion, after which the atmosphere allegedly became \"tense\". [*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### 2019 Amazon rainforest fires and Brazil[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: 45th G7 summit and 2019 Brazil wildfires\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump's reiteration that Russia should be readmitted to the group (see above), the instigation of a trade war with China, increased tensions in Iran, Trump's alleged reluctance to attend the conference, and a number of international crises made the 2019 G7 meeting in Biarritz, France, the most divided since its inception. Following President Trump's previous revocation of his signature to a joint communiqué agreed to in 2018 due to an alleged slight from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau (see above), French President Emmanuel Macron agreed that the group would not issue a joint communiqué at the Biarritz conference.\n\n\nThe G7 nations pledged US$20 million to help Brazil and other countries in South America fight the wildfires. This money was welcomed, although it was widely seen as a \"relatively small amount\" given the scale of the problem. Macron threatened to block a major trade deal between the European Union and Brazil (Mercosur) that would benefit the agricultural interests accused of driving deforestation.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Build Back Better World\n* Capitalism\n* D-10 Strategy Forum\n* Developed country\n* E7 (countries)\n* G4 (EU)\n* G6 (EU)\n* G8\n* G8+5\n* G10 currencies\n* G20\n* Great power\n* Group of Twelve (G12)\n* Junior 8\n* List of country groupings\n* List of G7 leaders\n* List of multilateral free trade agreements\n* OECD\n* Quint\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"What is the G7?\". *G7 UK Presidency 2021*.

It is organized around shared values of pluralism, liberal democracy, and representative government.[1][2][3] G7 members are the major IMF advanced economies.\n\n\nOriginating from an *ad hoc* gathering of finance ministers in 1973, the G7 has since become a formal, high-profile venue for discussing and coordinating solutions to major global issues, especially in the areas of trade, security, economics, and climate change.[4] Each member's head of government or state, along with the EU's Commission President and European Council President, meet annually at the G7 Summit; other high-ranking officials of the G7 and the EU meet throughout the year. Representatives of other states and international organizations are often invited as guests, with Russia having been a formal member (as part of the G8) from 1997 until its expulsion in 2014.\n\n\nThe G7 is not based on a treaty and has no permanent secretariat or office. It is organized through a presidency that rotates annually among the member states, with the presiding state setting the group's priorities and hosting the summit; Japan presides for 2023.[5] While lacking a legal or institutional basis, the G7 is widely considered to wield significant international influence;[6] it has catalyzed or spearheaded several major global initiatives, including efforts to combat the HIV/AIDS pandemic, provide financial aid to developing countries, and address climate change through the 2015 Paris Agreement.[6][1][7] However, the group has been criticized by observers for its allegedly outdated and limited membership, narrow global representation, and ineffectualness.[8][9][10]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Origins[edit]\n\n\nThe concept of a forum for the capitalist world's major industrialized countries emerged before the 1973 oil crisis. On 25 March 1973, the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, George Shultz, convened an informal gathering of finance ministers from West Germany (Helmut Schmidt), France (Valéry Giscard d'Estaing), and the United Kingdom (Anthony Barber) before an upcoming meeting in Washington, D.C. U.S. President Richard Nixon offered the White House as a venue, and the meeting was subsequently held in its library on the ground floor;[11] the original group of four consequently became known as the \"Library Group\".[12] In mid-1973, at the Spring Meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, Shultz proposed the addition of Japan, which all members accepted.[11] The informal gathering of senior financial officials from the U.S., U.K., West Germany, Japan, and France became known as the \"Group of Five\".[13]\n\n\nIn 1974, all five members endured sudden and often troubled changes in leadership. French President Georges Pompidou abruptly died, leading to a fresh presidential election that was closely won by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing. West German Chancellor Willy Brandt, American President Richard Nixon, and Japanese Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka all resigned due to scandals. In the United Kingdom, a hung election led to a minority government whose subsequent instability prompted another election the same year. Consequently, Nixon's successor, Gerald Ford, proposed a retreat the following year for the group's new leaders to learn about one another.\n\n\n\n### First summit and expansion[edit]\n\n\n![](image)First G6 summit at the Chateau de Rambouillet in November 1975\nAt the initiative of Giscard d'Estaing and his German counterpart, Helmut Schmidt, France hosted a three-day summit in November 1975, inviting the Group of Five plus Italy, forming the \"Group of Six\" (G6).[14] Taking place at the Château de Rambouillet, the meeting focused on several major economic issues, including the oil crisis, the collapse of the Bretton Woods system, and the ongoing global recession.[15] The result was the 15-point \"Declaration of Rambouillet\", which, among other positions, announced the group's united commitment to promoting free trade, multilateralism, cooperation with the developing world, and rapprochement with the Eastern Bloc.[16] The members also established plans for future gatherings to take place regularly every year.\n\n\nIn 1976, British Prime Minister Harold Wilson, who had participated in the first G6 summit, resigned from office; Schmidt and Ford believed the group needed an English speaker with more political experience, and advocated for inviting Pierre Trudeau, who had been Prime Minister of Canada for eight years – significantly longer than any G6 leader. Canada was also the next largest advanced economy after the G6 members.[17] The summit in Dorado, Puerto Rico later that year became the first of the current Group of Seven (G7).[15]\n\n\nIn 1977, the United Kingdom, which hosted that year's summit, invited the European Economic Community to join all G7 summits; beginning in 1981, it has attended every gathering through the president of the European Commission and the leader of the country holding the presidency of the Council of the European Union.[18] Since 2009, the then-newly established position of the President of the European Council, who serves as the Union's principal foreign representative, also regularly attends the summits.\n\n\n\n### Rising profile[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Flags of G7 members as seen on University Avenue, Toronto (September 2016)\nUntil the 1985 Plaza Accord, meetings between the seven governments' finance ministers were not public knowledge. The Accord, which involved only the original Group of Five, was announced the day before it was finalized, with a communiqué issued afterward.[19] The 1980s also marked the G7's expanded concerns beyond macroeconomic issues, namely with respect to international security and conflict; for example, it sought to address the ongoing conflicts between Iran and Iraq and between the Soviet Union and Afghanistan.\n\n\nFollowing the 1994 summit in Naples, Russian officials held separate meetings with leaders of the G7. This informal arrangement was dubbed the \"Political 8\" (P8), colloquially the G7+1. At the invitation of the G7 leaders, Russian President Boris Yeltsin was invited first as a guest observer, and later as a full participant. After the 1997 meeting, Russia was formally invited to the next meeting and formally joined the group in 1998, resulting in the Group of Eight (G8).[15] Russia was an outlier in the group, as it lacked the national wealth and financial weight of other members, had never been a major advanced economy, and was not yet an established liberal democracy.[20][21] Its invitation, made during a difficult transition to a post-communist economy, is believed to have been motivated by a desire to encourage its political and economic reforms and international engagement.\n\n\nRussia's membership was suspended in March 2014 in response to its annexation of Crimea.[22][23][24] Members stopped short of permanently ejecting the country,[25] and in subsequent years expressed an openness or express desire to reinstate Russian participation. In January 2017, Russia announced it would permanently leave the G8, which came into effect June 2018.[26][27] In 2020, U.S. President Donald Trump, backed by Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, advocated for Russia's return; all other members rejected the proposal, and Russia expressed no interest.[28]\n\n\n\n## Renewed calls for expanded membership[edit]\n\n\nThere have been various proposals to expand the G7. The U.S.-based Atlantic Council has held the D-10 Strategy Forum since 2014 with representatives from what it calls \"leading democracies\" which support a \"rules-based democratic order\", consisting of all members of the G7 (including the European Union) plus Australia and South Korea. Several democratic countries – including India, Indonesia, Poland, and Spain – participate as observers.[29] Centered around a similar mandate as the G7, the D-10 has been considered by some analysts to be an alternative to the group;[30] This is also favored by various think tanks and former British leader Boris Johnson.[29]\n\n\nIn 2019 under Putin, Russia had signaled support for the inclusion of China, India, and Turkey if the G7 had reinstated Russian membership.[31]\n\n\nIn 2020 under Trump, the U.S. had signaled support for the inclusion of Australia, Brazil, India, and South Korea, plus the reincorporation of Russia.[32][33] The leaders of the other six G7 members unanimously rejected this proposal.[34]\n\n\nAlso in November 2020, Jared Cohen and Richard Fontaine, writing in Foreign Affairs, suggested that the G7 might be expanded to a \"T-12\" of \"Techno Democracies\". Earlier, in June of that same year, the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence (GPAI) was announced. Something of a spin-out of the G7, founded by members Canada and France, GPAI's initial membership was 15, including both the EU and India, as well as Australia, Mexico, New Zealand, Singapore, Slovenia, and the Republic of Korea.\n\n\nBoris Johnson invited members of Australia and the Republic of Korea to the June 2021 G7 summit.[30] India was also invited to the 2021 summit, with an aim to \"deepen the expertise and experience around the table\" along with the other guests, according to a U.K. government statement.[35]\n\n\nIn 2021, French jurist and consultant Eric Garner de Béville, a member of the *Cercle Montesquieu*, proposed Spain's membership to the G7.[36] American Chargé d'Affaires in Spain, Conrad Tribble, stated that the United States \"enthusiastically supports\" a \"greater\" role of Spanish leadership at the international level.[37]\n\n\nIn 2022, Germany has confirmed it will be inviting India,[38] against rumours to the contrary.[39][40][*needs update*]\n\n\nIn 2023, Japan's prime minister Fumio Kishida invited South Korea, Australia, India, Indonesia, Brazil, Vietnam, Comoros (representing the African Union), the Cook Islands (representing the Pacific Islands Forum) and Ukraine to the 49th summit hosted in Hiroshima.[41][42][43][44][45][46]\n\n\n\n## Activities and initiatives[edit]\n\n\n![G7 is located in Europe](image)![1st](image)\n1st\n![3rd, 10th, 17th](image)\n3rd, 10th, 17th\n![4th, 11th](image)\n4th, 11th\n![6th, 13th](image)\n6th, 13th\n![8th](image)\n8th\n![15th](image)\n15th\n![18th](image)\n18th\n![20th](image)\n20th\n![22nd](image)\n22nd\n![24th](image)\n24th\n![25th](image)\n25th\n![27th](image)\n27th\n![29th](image)\n29th\n![31st](image)\n31st\n![32nd](image)\n32nd\n![33rd](image)\n33rd\n![35th](image)\n35th\n![37th](image)\n37th\n![39th](image)\n39th\n![40th](image)\n40th\n![41st](image)\n41st\n![43rd'](image)\n43rd'\n![45th](image)\n45th\n![47th](image)\n47th\nclass=notpageimage|\nHost venues of G7 summits in Europe\n\nThe G7 was founded primarily to facilitate shared macroeconomic initiatives in response to contemporary economic problems; the first gathering was centered around the Nixon shock, the 1970s energy crisis, and the ensuing global recession.[47] Since 1975, the group has met annually at summits organized and hosted by whichever country occupies the annually-rotating presidency;[48] since 1987, the G7 Finance Ministers have met at least semi-annually, and up to four times a year at stand-alone meetings.[49]\n\n\nBeginning in the 1980s, the G7 broadened its areas of concern to include issues of international security, human rights, and global security; for example, during this period, the G7 concerned itself with the ongoing Iran-Iraq War and Soviet occupation of Afghanistan.[48] In the 1990s, it launched a debt-relief program for the 42 heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC);[50] provided $300 million to help build the Shelter Structure over the damaged reactor at Chernobyl;[51] and established the Financial Stability Forum to help in \"managing the international monetary system\".[52]\n\n\n\n![G7 is located in North America](image)![2nd](image)\n2nd\n![7th](image)\n7th\n![9th](image)\n9th\n![14th](image)\n14th\n![16th](image)\n16th\n![21st](image)\n21st\n![23rd](image)\n23rd\n![28th](image)\n28th\n![30th](image)\n30th\n![36th](image)\n36th\n![38th](image)\n38th\n![44th](image)\n44th\nclass=notpageimage|\nHost venues of G7 summits in North America\n\nAt the turn of the 21st century, the G7 began emphasizing engagement with the developing world. At the 1999 summit, the group helped launch the G20, a similar forum made up of the G7 and the next 13 largest economies (including the European Union), in order to \"promote dialogue between major industrial and emerging market countries\";[52] the G20 has been touted by some of its members as a replacement for the G7.[53] Having previously announced a plan to cancel 90% of bilateral debt for the HIPC, totaling $100 billion, in 2005 the G7 announced debt reductions of \"up to 100%\" to be negotiated on a \"case by case\" basis.[54]\n\n\nFollowing the global financial crisis of 2007–2008, which was the worst of its kind since the 1970s,[55] the G7 met twice in Washington, D.C. in 2008 and in Rome, the following February.[56][57] News media reported that much of the world was looking to the group for leadership and solutions.[58] G7 finance ministers pledged to take \"all necessary steps\" to stem the crisis,[59] devising an \"aggressive action plan\" that included providing publicly funded capital infusions to banks in danger of failing.[60] Some analysts criticized the group for seemingly advocating that individual governments develop individual responses to the recession, rather than cohere around a united effort.[61]\n\n\nIn subsequent years, the G7 has faced several geopolitical challenges that have led some international analysts to question its credibility,[62] or propose its replacement by the G20.[63] On 2 March 2014, the G7 condemned the Russian Federation for its \"violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine\" through its military intervention.[64] The group also announced its commitment to \"mobilize rapid technical assistance to support Ukraine in addressing its macroeconomic, regulatory and anti-corruption challenges\", while adding that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) was best suited to stabilizing the country's finances and economy.[64]\n\n\n\n![G7 is located in Japan](image)![5th, 12th, 19th](image)\n5th, 12th, 19th\n![26th](image)\n26th\n![34th](image)\n34th\n![42nd](image)\n42nd\n![49th](image)\n49th\nclass=notpageimage|\nHost venues of G7 summits in Japan\n\nIn response to Russia's subsequent annexation of Crimea, on 24 March the G7 convened an emergency meeting at the official residence of the Prime Minister of the Netherlands, the Catshuis in The Hague; this location was chosen because all G7 leaders were already present to attend the 2014 Nuclear Security Summit hosted by the Netherlands. This was the first G7 meeting neither taking place in a member state nor having the host leader participating in the meeting.[65] The upcoming G8 summit in Sochi, Russia was moved to Brussels, where the EU was the host. On 5 June 2014 the G7 condemned Moscow for its \"continuing violation\" of Ukraine's sovereignty and stated they were prepared to impose further sanctions on Russia.[66] This meeting was the first since Russia was suspended from the G8,[66] and subsequently it has not been involved in any G7 summit.\n\n\nThe G7 has continued to take a strong stance against Russia's \"destabilising behaviour and malign activities\" in Ukraine and elsewhere around the world, following the joint communique from the June 2021 summit in the U.K.[67] The group also called on Russia to address international cybercrime attacks launched from within its borders, and to investigate the use of chemical weapons on Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny.[67] The June 2021 summit also saw the G7 commit to helping the world recover from the global COVID-19 pandemic (including plans to help vaccinate the entire world); encourage further action against climate change and biodiversity loss; and promote \"shared values\" of pluralism and democracy.[35]\n\n\nIn 2022, G7 leaders were invited to attend an extraordinary summit of NATO called in response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.[68][69]\n\n\n\n### Summit organization[edit]\n\n\nThe annual G7 summit is attended by each member's head of government.[70] The member country holding the G7 presidency is responsible for organizing and hosting the year's summit. The serial annual summits can be parsed chronologically in arguably distinct ways, including as the sequence of host countries for the summits has recurred over time and series.[71] Generally every country hosts the summit once every seven years.[72]\n\n\nBesides a main meeting in June or July, a number of other meetings may take place throughout the year; in 2021 for example, seven tracks existed for finance (4–5 June 2021), environmental (20 and 21 May 2021), health (3–4 June 2021), trade (27–28 May 2021), interior (7–9 September 2021) digital and technology (28–29 April 2021), development (3–5 May 2021) and foreign ministers.[73]\n\n\n\n\n## List of summits[edit]\n\n\n\n\nOverview of G7 summits\n| #\n | Date\n | Host\n | Host leader\n | Location held\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1st | 15–17 November 1975 | ![](image) France | Valéry Giscard d'Estaing | Château de Rambouillet, Yvelines | The first and last G6 summit.\n |\n| 2nd | 27–28 June 1976 | ![](image) United States | Gerald R.

US President Donald Trump did not agree to the economic section of the final statement.[107] The G7 members also announced to recall sanctions and to be ready to take further restrictive measures against Russian Federation for its failure to implement the Minsk Protocol completely.[108] |\n| 45th | 24–26 August 2019 | ![](image) France[109] | Emmanuel Macron | Biarritz, Pyrénées-Atlantiques | It was agreed at the summit that the World Trade Organization, \"with regard to intellectual property protection, to settle disputes more swiftly and to eliminate unfair trade practices\", \"to simplify regulatory barriers and modernize international taxation within the framework of the OECD\", \"to ensure that Iran never acquires nuclear weapons and to foster peace and stability in the region\", and \"to support a truce in Libya that will lead to a long-term ceasefire\".

The People's Republic of China, according to its data, would be the second-largest with 17.90% of the world net wealth,[130] but is excluded because of its relatively low net wealth per adult and Human Development Index.[20] As of 2021, Crédit Suisse reports the G7 (without the European Union) represents around 53% of the global net wealth;[131] including the EU, the G7 accounts for over 60% of the global net wealth.[131]\n\n\n\n\n\nOverview of G7 members\n| Member\n | Trade mil.

About 300 of those reached the 3 m high and 7 km long security fence surrounding the summit location. The protesters questioned the legitimacy of the G7 to make decisions that could affect the whole world. Authorities had banned demonstrations in the area closest to the summit location and 20,000 police were on duty in Southern Bavaria to keep activists and protesters from interfering with the summit.[134][135]\n\n\n\n### 2018 Trump conflict over tariffs and Russia[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: 44th G7 summit and Russo-Ukrainian War\n\nThe 2018 meeting in Charlevoix, Canada, was marred by fractious negotiations concerning tariffs and Donald Trump's position that Russia should be reinstated to the G7. The Trump administration had just imposed steel and aluminium tariffs on many countries, including European countries that are fellow members of the G7, and Canada, the host country for the 2018 meeting. Trump expressed dismay at Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for holding a press conference in which Canada restated its position on tariffs (a public criticism of Trump's economic policy), and directed his representatives at the meeting not to sign the economic section of the joint communiqué that is typically issued at the conclusion of the meeting.\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel described Trump's behaviour as a \"depressing withdrawal\", while French President Emmanuel Macron invited him \"to be serious\".[136] In the final statement signed by all members except the US, the G7 announced its intention to recall sanctions and to be ready to take further restrictive measures within the next months against the Russian Federation for its failure to completely implement the Minsk Agreement.[108]\n\n\nTrump repeated calls for Russia to be re-admitted to the group at the 2019 meeting in Biarritz, saying it should be included in discussions relating to Iran, Syria, and North Korea. The Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte supported Trump's proposal, Shinzo Abe of Japan was neutral, and the rest of the G7 pushed back against the suggestion, after which the atmosphere allegedly became \"tense\". [*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### 2019 Amazon rainforest fires and Brazil[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: 45th G7 summit and 2019 Brazil wildfires\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump's reiteration that Russia should be readmitted to the group (see above), the instigation of a trade war with China, increased tensions in Iran, Trump's alleged reluctance to attend the conference, and a number of international crises made the 2019 G7 meeting in Biarritz, France, the most divided since its inception. Following President Trump's previous revocation of his signature to a joint communiqué agreed to in 2018 due to an alleged slight from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau (see above), French President Emmanuel Macron agreed that the group would not issue a joint communiqué at the Biarritz conference.\n\n\nThe G7 nations pledged US$20 million to help Brazil and other countries in South America fight the wildfires. This money was welcomed, although it was widely seen as a \"relatively small amount\" given the scale of the problem. Macron threatened to block a major trade deal between the European Union and Brazil (Mercosur) that would benefit the agricultural interests accused of driving deforestation.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Build Back Better World\n* Capitalism\n* D-10 Strategy Forum\n* Developed country\n* E7 (countries)\n* G4 (EU)\n* G6 (EU)\n* G8\n* G8+5\n* G10 currencies\n* G20\n* Great power\n* Group of Twelve (G12)\n* Junior 8\n* List of country groupings\n* List of G7 leaders\n* List of multilateral free trade agreements\n* OECD\n* Quint\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"What is the G7?\". *G7 UK Presidency 2021*.

Canada stretches from the Atlantic Ocean in the east to the Pacific Ocean in the west; to the north lies the Arctic Ocean.[1] Greenland is to the northeast with a shared border on Hans Island. To the southeast Canada shares a maritime boundary with France's overseas collectivity of Saint Pierre and Miquelon, the last vestige of New France.[2] By total area (including its waters), Canada is the second-largest country in the world, after Russia. By land area alone, however, Canada ranks fourth, the difference being due to it having the world's largest proportion of fresh water lakes.[3] Of Canada's thirteen provinces and territories, only two are landlocked (Alberta and Saskatchewan) while the other eleven all directly border one of three oceans.\n\n\nCanada is home to the world's northernmost settlement, Canadian Forces Station Alert, on the northern tip of Ellesmere Island—latitude 82.5°N—which lies 817 kilometres (508 mi) from the North Pole.[4] Much of the Canadian Arctic is covered by ice and permafrost.[5] Canada has the longest coastline in the world, with a total length of 243,042 kilometres (151,019 mi);[6] additionally, its border with the United States is the world's longest land border, stretching 8,891 kilometres (5,525 mi).[7] Three of Canada's Arctic islands, Baffin Island, Victoria Island and Ellesmere Island, are among the ten largest in the world.[8]\n\n\nCanada can be divided into seven physiographic regions: the Canadian Shield, the interior plains, the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Lowlands, the Appalachian region, the Western Cordillera, Hudson Bay Lowlands and the Arctic Archipelago.[9] Canada is also divided into fifteen terrestrial and five marine ecozones,[10] encompassing over 80,000 classified species of life.[11] Since the end of the last glacial period, Canada has consisted of eight distinct forest regions, including extensive boreal forest on the Canadian Shield;[12] 42 percent of the land acreage of Canada is covered by forests (approximately 8 percent of the world's forested land), made up mostly of spruce, poplar and pine.[13] Canada has over 2,000,000 lakes—563 greater than 100 km2 (39 sq mi)—which is more than any other country, containing much of the world's fresh water.[14][15] There are also freshwater glaciers in the Canadian Rockies, the Coast Mountains and the Arctic Cordillera.[16] A recent global remote sensing analysis also suggested that there were 6,477 km2 of tidal flats in Canada, making it the 5th ranked country in terms of how much tidal flat occurs there.[17] Protected areas of Canada and National Wildlife Areas have been established to preserve ecosystems.[18]\n\n\nCanada is geologically active, having many earthquakes and potentially active volcanoes, notably the Mount Meager massif, Mount Garibaldi, Mount Cayley, and the Mount Edziza volcanic complex.[19] Average winter and summer high temperatures across Canada range from Arctic weather in the north, to hot summers in the southern regions, with four distinct seasons.\n\n\n\n\n## Physiography [edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of regions of Canada § Primary, secondary, and local geographic\n\nSee also: Geological history of North America\n\n![](image)Canada can be divided into seven physiographic regions: the Canadian Shield, the interior plains, the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Lowlands, the Appalachian region, the Western Cordillera, Hudson Bay Lowlands, and the Arctic Archipelago.\nCanada covers 9,984,670 km2 (3,855,100 sq mi) and a panoply of various geoclimatic regions, of which there are seven main regions.[9] Canada also encompasses vast maritime terrain, with the world's longest coastline of 243,042 kilometres (151,019 mi).[20] The physical geography of Canada is widely varied. Boreal forests prevail throughout the country, ice is prominent in northerly Arctic regions and through the Canadian Rocky Mountains, and the relatively flat Canadian Prairies in the southwest facilitate productive agriculture.[21] The Great Lakes feed the St. Lawrence River (in the southeast) where lowlands host much of Canada's population.\n\n\nThe National Topographic System is used by Natural Resources Canada for providing general purpose topographic maps of the country. The maps provide details on landforms and terrain, lakes and rivers, forested areas, administrative zones, populated areas, roads and railways, as well as other man-made features.[22] These maps are used by all levels of government and industry for forest fire and flood control (as well as other environmental issues), depiction of crop areas, right-of-way, real estate planning, development of natural resources and highway planning.[22]\n\n\n\n### Appalachian Mountains[edit]\n\n\nThe Appalachian mountain range extends from Alabama in southern United States through the Gaspé Peninsula and the Atlantic Provinces, creating rolling hills indented by river valleys.[23] It also runs through parts of southern Quebec.[23]\n\n\nThe Appalachian Mountains (more specifically the Chic-Choc, Notre Dame, and Long Range Mountains) are an old and eroded range of mountains, approximately 380 million years in age. Notable mountains in the Appalachians include Mount Jacques-Cartier (Quebec, 1,268 m or 4,160 ft), Mount Carleton (New Brunswick, 817 m or 2,680 ft), The Cabox (Newfoundland, 814 m or 2,671 ft).[24] Parts of the Appalachians are home to a rich endemic flora and fauna and are considered to have been nunataks during the last glaciation era.\n\n\n\n### Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Lowlands[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A map of the Great Lakes Basin showing the five sub-basins within. Left to right they are: Superior, including Nipigon's basin, (magenta); Michigan (cyan); Huron (pale green); Erie (yellow); Ontario (light coral).\nThe Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Lowlands, or simply St. Lawrence Lowlands, is a physiographic region of Eastern Canada that comprises a section of southern Ontario bounded on the north by the Canadian Shield and by three of the Great Lakes — Lake Huron, Lake Erie and Lake Ontario — and extends along the St. Lawrence River to the Strait of Belle Isle[25] and the Atlantic Ocean. The lowlands comprise three sub-regions that were created by intrusions from adjacent physiographic regions — the West Lowland, Central Lowland and East Lowland.[25] The West Lowland includes the Niagara Escarpment, extending from the Niagara River to the Bruce Peninsula and Manitoulin Island.[25] The Central Lowland stretches between the Ottawa River and the St. Lawrence River.[25] The East Lowland includes Anticosti Island, Îles de Mingan, and extends to the Strait of Belle Isle.\n\n\nThe St. Lawrence Lowlands is one of the most densely populated, prosperous and productive regions in Canada. Major urban areas include Toronto, Montreal, Ottawa-Gatineau and Quebec City. \n\n\n\nThe St. Lawrence Lowlands was covered by surficial deposits left by ice sheets following the Pleistocene glaciations.[25] It is the smallest of Canada's seven physiographic regions — the others being the Arctic Lands, the Cordillera, the Interior Plains, the Canadian Shield, the Hudson Bay Lowlands and the Appalachian Uplands — distinguished by topography and geology.[25] The boundaries of the area largely reflect that of the Mixedwood Plains Ecozone, the smallest of Canada's fifteen terrestrial ecozones.\n\n### Canadian Shield[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Canadian Shield\n\n![](image)The Canadian Shield is a broad region of Precambrian rock (pictured in shades of red)\nThe northeastern part of Alberta, northern parts of Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec, all of Labrador and the Great Northern Peninsula of Newfoundland, eastern mainland Northwest Territories, most of Nunavut's mainland and, of its Arctic Archipelago, Baffin Island and significant bands through Somerset, Southampton, Devon and Ellesmere islands are located on a vast rock base known as the Canadian Shield.[26] The Shield mostly consists of eroded hilly terrain and contains many lakes and important rivers used for hydroelectric production, particularly in northern Quebec and Ontario. The Shield also encloses an area of wetlands around the Hudson Bay. Some particular regions of the Shield are referred to as mountain ranges, including the Torngat and Laurentian Mountains.[27]\n\n\nThe Shield cannot support intensive agriculture, although there is subsistence agriculture and small dairy farms in many of the river valleys and around the abundant lakes, particularly in the southern regions. Boreal forest covers much of the shield, with a mix of conifers that provide valuable timber resources in areas such as the Central Canadian Shield forests ecoregion that covers much of Northern Ontario.\n\n\nThe Canadian Shield is known for its vast mineral reserves such as emeralds, diamonds and copper, and is there also called the \"mineral house\".[27]\n\n\n\n### Canadian Interior Plains[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Interior Plains\n![](image)Palliser's Triangle, delineating prairie soil types in the Prairie provinces.\nThe Canadian Prairies (usually referred to as simply the Prairies in Canada) is a region in Western Canada. It includes the Canadian portion of the Great Plains and the Prairie provinces, namely Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba.[28] These provinces are partially covered by grasslands, plains, and lowlands, mostly in the southern regions. The northernmost reaches of the Canadian Prairies are less dense in population, marked by forests and more variable topography.[29] If the region is defined to include areas only covered by prairie land, the corresponding region is known as the Interior Plains.[30] Physical or ecological aspects of the Canadian Prairies extend to northeastern British Columbia, but that area is not included in political use of the term.[31]\n\n\n\nThe prairies in Canada are a temperate grassland and shrubland biome within the prairie ecoregion of Canada that consists of northern mixed grasslands in Alberta, Saskatchewan, southern Manitoba, as well as northern short grasslands in southeastern Alberta and southwestern Saskatchewan.[32] The Prairies Ecozone of Canada includes the northern tall grasslands in southern Manitoba and Aspen parkland, which covers central Alberta, central Saskatchewan, and southern Manitoba.[33] The Prairie starts from north of Edmonton and it covers the three provinces in a southward-slanting line east to the Manitoba–Minnesota border.[34] Alberta has the most land classified as prairie, while Manitoba has the least, as the boreal forest begins more southerly in Manitoba than in Alberta.[35]\n\n### Canadian Arctic[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Arctic Archipelago\n\nWhile the largest part of the Canadian Arctic is composed of seemingly endless permafrost and tundra north of the tree line, it encompasses geological regions of varying types: the Arctic Cordillera (with the British Empire Range and the United States Range on Ellesmere Island) contains the northernmost mountain system in the world. The Arctic Lowlands and Hudson Bay lowlands comprise a substantial part of the geographic region often designated as the Canadian Shield (in contrast to the sole geologic area). The ground in the Arctic is mostly composed of permafrost, making construction difficult and often hazardous, and agriculture virtually impossible.[36]\n\n\nThe Arctic, when defined as everything north of the tree line, covers most of Nunavut and the northernmost parts of Northwest Territories, Yukon, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec and Labrador. The archipelago consists of 36,563 islands, of which 94 are classified as major islands, being larger than 130 km2 (50 sq mi), and cover a total area of 1,400,000 km2 (540,000 sq mi).[36]\n\n\n\n### Western Cordillera[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Pacific Cordillera (Canada)\n\n![](image)Map of the Hart Ranges in British Columbia\nThe Coast Mountains in British Columbia run from the lower Fraser River and the Fraser Canyon northwestward, separating the Interior Plateau from the Pacific Ocean.[37] Its southeastern end is separated from the North Cascades by the Fraser Lowland, where nearly a third of Western Canada's population reside.\n\n\nThe coastal flank of the Coast Mountains is characterized by an intense network of fjords and associated islands, very similar to the Norwegian coastline in Northern Europe; while their inland side transitions to the high plateau with dryland valleys notable for a series of large alpine lakes similar to those in southern Switzerland, beginning in deep mountains and ending in flatland. They are subdivided in three main groups, the Pacific Ranges between the Fraser River and Bella Coola, the Kitimat Ranges from there northwards to the Nass River, and the Boundary Ranges from there to the mountain terminus in Yukon at Champagne Pass and Chilkat Pass northwest of Haines, Alaska.[37] The Saint Elias Mountains lie to their west and northwest, while the Yukon Ranges and Yukon Basin lie to their north. On the inland side of the Boundary Ranges are the Tahltan and Tagish Highlands and also the Skeena Mountains, part of the Interior Mountains system, which also extend southwards on the inland side of the Kitimat Ranges.[37]\n\n\nThe terrain of the main spine of the Coast Mountains is typified by heavy glaciation, including several very large icefields of varying elevation. Of the three subdivisions, the Pacific Ranges are the highest and are crowned by Mount Waddington, while the Boundary Ranges contain the largest icefields, the Juneau Icefield being the largest. The Kitimat Ranges are lower and less glacier-covered than either of the other two groupings, but are extremely rugged and dense.\n\n\nThe Coast Mountains are made of igneous and metamorphic rock from an episode of arc volcanism related to subduction of the Kula and Farallon Plates during the Laramide orogeny about 100 million years ago.[38] The widespread granite forming the Coast Mountains formed when magma intruded and cooled at depth beneath volcanoes of the Coast Range Arc whereas the metamorphic formed when intruding magma heated the surrounding rock to produce schist.\n\n\nThe Insular Mountains extend from Vancouver Island in the south to the Haida Gwaii in the north on the British Columbia Coast. It contains two main mountain ranges, the Vancouver Island Ranges on Vancouver Island and the Queen Charlotte Mountains on Haida Gwaii.[39]\n\n\n\n### Hudson Bay Lowlands[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Hudson Bay Lowlands approximately coincide with the Southern Hudson Bay taiga ecoregion of North America.\nThe Hudson Bay Lowlands is a vast wetland located between the Canadian Shield and southern shores of Hudson Bay and James Bay. Most of the area lies within the province of Ontario, with smaller portions reaching into Manitoba and Quebec. Many wide and slow-moving rivers flow through this area toward the saltwater of Hudson Bay: these include the Churchill, Nelson and Hayes in Manitoba, Severn, Fawn, Winisk, Asheweig, Ekwan, Attawapiskat, and Albany in Ontario, and the Harricana, Rupert and Eastmain in Quebec.[40] This is the largest wetland in Canada, and one of the largest in the world.[41] The region can be subdivided into three bands running roughly northwest to southeast: the Coastal Hudson Bay Lowland (a narrow band along the northern coast),[42] Hudson Bay Lowland (a broader band extending to slightly south of the Ekwan River),[43] and James Bay Lowland (all the rest of the southern/eastern lands, making up close to 50% of the total Lowlands area).[44]\n\n\n\nThe entire area was covered by ice during the last glaciation, and the peatlands have accumulated over the last ten thousand years. Plants from more temperate regions mix with arctic species.[45] A majority of the wetland is peat bog, although salt marshes occur along the coast, and marshes and wet meadows occur along the major rivers. The wetlands provide important habitat for migratory birds including shorebirds (e.g., yellow rail) and waterfowl (e.g., snow geese). Large mammals include polar bears and wolverines.[41]\n\n#### Extreme points[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Extreme points of Canada\n\nSee also: Extreme points of Canadian provinces\n\n![](image)Topographic map\nThe northernmost point of land within the boundaries of Canada is Cape Columbia, Ellesmere Island, Nunavut 83°06′40″N 69°58′19″W﻿ / ﻿83.111°N 69.972°W﻿ / 83.111; -69.972﻿ (Cape Columbia, Nunavut).[46] The northernmost point of the Canadian mainland is Zenith Point on Boothia Peninsula, Nunavut 72°00′07″N 94°39′18″W﻿ / ﻿72.002°N 94.655°W﻿ / 72.002; -94.655﻿ (Zenith Point, Nunavut).[46] The southernmost point is Middle Island, in Lake Erie, Ontario (41°41′N 82°40′W); the southernmost water point lies just south of the island, on the Ontario–Ohio border (41°40′35″N). The southernmost point of the Canadian mainland is Point Pelee, Ontario 41°54′32″N 82°30′32″W﻿ / ﻿41.909°N 82.509°W﻿ / 41.909; -82.509﻿ (Point Pelee, Ontario).[46] The lowest point is sea level at 0 m,[47] whilst the highest point is Mount Logan, Yukon, at 5,959 m / 19,550 ft 60°34′01″N 140°24′18″W﻿ / ﻿60.567°N 140.405°W﻿ / 60.567; -140.405﻿ (Mount Logan, Yukon).[46]\n\n\nThe westernmost point is Boundary Peak 187 (60°18′22.929″N 141°00′7.128″W) at the southern end of the Yukon–Alaska border, which roughly follows 141°W but leans very slightly east as it goes North 60°18′04″N 141°00′36″W﻿ / ﻿60.301°N 141.010°W﻿ / 60.301; -141.010﻿ (Boundary Peak 187).[48][46] The easternmost point is Cape Spear, Newfoundland (47°31′N 52°37′W) 47°31′23″N 52°37′08″W﻿ / ﻿47.523°N 52.619°W﻿ / 47.523; -52.619﻿ (Cape Spear, Newfoundland).[46] The easternmost point of the Canadian mainland is Elijah Point, Cape St. Charles, Labrador (52°13′N 55°37′W) 52°13′01″N 55°37′16″W﻿ / ﻿52.217°N 55.621°W﻿ / 52.217; -55.621﻿ (Elijah Point, Labrador).[46]\n\n\nThe Canadian pole of inaccessibility is allegedly near Jackfish River, Alberta (59°2′N 112°49′W).[49] The furthest straight-line distance that can be travelled to Canadian points of land is between the southwest tip of Kluane National Park and Reserve (next to Mount Saint Elias) and Cripple Cove, Newfoundland (near Cape Race) at a distance of 3,005.60 nautical miles (5,566.37 km; 3,458.78 mi).\n\n\n\n## Climatology [edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Temperature in Canada\n\n![](image)Köppen climate classification types of Canada\nClimate varies widely from region to region. Winters can be harsh in many parts of the country, particularly in the interior and Prairie provinces, which experience a continental climate, where daily average temperatures are near −15 °C (5 °F), but can drop below −40 °C (−40 °F) with severe wind chills.[50] In non-coastal regions, snow can cover the ground for almost six months of the year, while in parts of the north snow can persist year-round. Coastal British Columbia has a temperate climate, with a mild and rainy winter. On the east and west coasts, average high temperatures are generally in the low 20s °C (70s °F), while between the coasts, the average summer high temperature ranges from 25 to 30 °C (77 to 86 °F), with temperatures in some interior locations occasionally exceeding 40 °C (104 °F).[51]\n\n\nMuch of Northern Canada is covered by ice and permafrost; however, the future of the permafrost is uncertain because the Arctic has been warming at three times the global average as a result of climate change in Canada.[52] Canada's annual average temperature over land has warmed by 1.7 °C (3.1 °F), with changes ranging from 1.1 to 2.3 °C (2.0 to 4.1 °F) in various regions, since 1948.[53] The rate of warming has been higher across the North and in the Prairies.[53] In the southern regions of Canada, air pollution from both Canada and the United States—caused by metal smelting, burning coal to power utilities, and vehicle emissions—has resulted in acid rain, which has severely impacted waterways, forest growth and agricultural productivity in Canada.[54]\n\n\n\n## Biogeography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Wildlife of Canada\n\n![](image)ELC Ecozones and ecoprovinces of Canada\nCanada is divided into fifteen major terrestrial and five marine ecozones, that are further subdivided into 53 ecoprovinces, 194 ecoregions, and 1,027 ecodistricts.[10] These eco-areas encompass over 80,000 classified species of Canadian wildlife, with an equal number yet to be formally recognized or discovered.[55] Due to pollution, loss of biodiversity, over-exploitation of commercial species, invasive species, and habitat loss, there are currently more than 800 wild life species at risk of being lost.[56]\n\n\nCanada's major biomes are the tundra, boreal forest, grassland, and temperate deciduous forest. British Columbia contains several smaller biomes, including; mountain forest which extends to Alberta, and a small temperate rainforest along the Pacific coast, the semi arid desert located in the Okanagan and alpine tundra in the higher mountainous regions.[57]\n\n\nOver half of Canada's landscape is intact and relatively free of human development.[58] Approximately half of Canada is covered by forest, totaling around 2.4 million km2 (0.93 million sq mi).[59] The boreal forest of Canada is considered to be the largest intact forest on earth, with around 300,000 square kilometres (120,000 sq mi) undisturbed by roads, cities or industry.[60] The Canadian Arctic tundra is the second-largest vegetation region in the country consisting of dwarf shrubs, sedges and grasses, mosses and lichens.[61]\n\n\nApproximately 12.1 percent of the nation's landmass and freshwater are conservation areas, including 11.4 percent designated as protected areas.[18] Approximately 13.8 percent of its territorial waters are conserved, including 8.9 percent designated as protected areas.[18]\n\n\n\n## Palaeogeography[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Volcanism of Canada and Geology of Canada\n\n![](image)Mount Edziza, a stratovolcano in northwestern British Columbia\n![](image)A topographic map of Canada, showing elevations shaded from green (lower) to brown (higher)\nVolcanic activity is a major part of the geology of Canada and is characterized by many types of volcanic landform, including lava flows, volcanic plateaus, lava domes, cinder cones, stratovolcanoes, shield volcanoes, submarine volcanoes, calderas, diatremes, and maars, along with less common volcanic forms such as tuyas and subglacial mounds.\n\n\nThough Canada's volcanic history dates back to the Precambrian eon, at least 3.11 billion years ago, when its part of the North American continent began to form,[62] volcanism continues to occur in Western and Northern Canada in modern times, where it forms part of an encircling chain of volcanoes and frequent earthquakes around the Pacific Ocean called the Pacific Ring of Fire.[63] Because volcanoes in Western and Northern Canada are in relatively remote and sparsely populated areas and their activity is less frequent than with other volcanoes around the Pacific Ocean, Canada is commonly thought to occupy a gap in the Ring of Fire between the volcanoes of the western United States to the south and the Aleutian volcanoes of Alaska to the north.[64] Even so, the mountainous landscapes of the Canadian provinces of Alberta, British Columbia, Yukon, and the Northwest Territories include more than 100 volcanoes that have been active during the past two million years and whose eruptions have claimed many lives.[64]\n\n\n\nVolcanic activity is responsible for many of Canada's geological and geographical features and mineralization, including the nucleus of the North American continent, known as the Canadian Shield. Volcanism has led to the formation of hundreds of volcanic areas and extensive lava formations across Canada. The country's different volcano and lava types originate from different tectonic settings and types of volcanic eruptions, ranging from passive lava eruptions to violent explosive eruptions. Canada has a rich record of very large volumes of magmatic rock called large igneous provinces, represented by deep-level plumbing systems consisting of giant dike swarms, sill provinces and layered intrusions.[65] The most capable large igneous provinces in Canada are Archean greenstone belts estimated at 3.8 to 2.5 billion years old, containing a rare volcanic rock called komatiite.[65]\n\n## Hydrography[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of rivers of Canada and Watersheds of North America\n\n![](image)Rivers of Canada\nCanada holds vast reserves of water: its rivers discharge nearly 7% of the world's renewable water supply,[66] Canada has over 2,000,000 lakes—563 greater than 100 square kilometres (39 sq mi)—which is more than any other country and has the third largest amount of glacier water.[67] Canada is also home to about twenty five percent (134.6 million ha) of the world's wetlands that support a vast array of local ecosystems.[68]\n\n\nCanada's waterways host forty-seven rivers of at least 600 kilometres (370 mi) in length, with the two longest being the Mackenzie River, that begins at Great Slave Lake and ends in the Arctic Ocean, with its drainage basin covering a large part of northwestern Canada, and the Saint Lawrence River, which drains the Great Lakes into the Gulf of St. Lawrence ending in the Atlantic Ocean. The Mackenzie, including its tributaries is over 4,200 kilometres (2,600 mi) in length and lies within the second largest drainage basin of North America, while the St. Lawrence 3,058 kilometres (1,900 mi) in length, drains the world's largest system of freshwater lakes.[69]\n\n\nThe Atlantic watershed drains the entirety of the Atlantic provinces (parts of the Quebec-Labrador border are fixed at the Atlantic Ocean-Arctic Ocean continental divide), most of inhabited Quebec and large parts of southern Ontario. It is mostly drained by the economically important St. Lawrence River and its tributaries, notably the Saguenay, Manicouagan, and Ottawa rivers. The Great Lakes and Lake Nipigon are also drained by the St. Lawrence. The Churchill River and Saint John River are other important elements of the Atlantic watershed in Canada.[70]\n\n\n\n![](image)Drainage basins of Canada\nThe Hudson Bay watershed drains over a third of Canada. It covers Manitoba, northern Ontario and Quebec, most of Saskatchewan, southern Alberta, southwestern Nunavut, and the southern half of Baffin Island. This basin is most important in fighting drought in the prairies and producing hydroelectricity, especially in Manitoba, northern Ontario and Quebec. Major elements of this watershed include Lake Winnipeg, Nelson River, the North Saskatchewan and South Saskatchewan Rivers, Assiniboine River, and Nettilling Lake on Baffin Island. Wollaston Lake lies on the boundary between the Hudson Bay and Arctic Ocean watersheds and drains into both. It is the largest lake in the world that naturally drains in two directions.[70]\n\n\nThe continental divide in the Rockies separates the Pacific watershed in British Columbia and Yukon from the Arctic and Hudson Bay watersheds. This watershed irrigates the agriculturally important areas of inner British Columbia (such as the Okanagan and Kootenay valleys), and is used to produce hydroelectricity. Major elements are the Yukon, Columbia and Fraser rivers.[70]\n\n\nThe northern parts of Alberta, Manitoba, and British Columbia, most of Northwest Territories and Nunavut, and parts of Yukon are drained by the Arctic watershed. This watershed has been little used for hydroelectricity, with the exception of the Mackenzie River. The Peace, Athabasca and Liard Rivers, as well as Great Bear Lake and Great Slave Lake (respectively the largest and second largest lakes wholly enclosed by Canada) are significant elements of the Arctic watershed. Each of these elements eventually merges with the Mackenzie, thereby draining the vast majority of the Arctic watershed.[70]\n\n\nThe southernmost part of Alberta drains into the Gulf of Mexico through the Milk River and its tributaries. The Milk River originates in the Rocky Mountains of Montana, then flows into Alberta, then returns into the United States, where it is drained by the Missouri River. A small area of southwestern Saskatchewan is drained by Battle Creek, which empties into the Milk River.[70]\n\n\n\n## Natural resources[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Economy of Canada\n\nCanada's abundance of natural resources is reflected in their continued importance in the economy of Canada. Major resource-based industries are fisheries, forestry, agriculture, petroleum products and mining.[71]\n\n\nThe fisheries industry has historically been one of Canada's strongest. Unmatched cod stocks on the Grand Banks of Newfoundland launched this industry in the 16th century. Today these stocks are nearly depleted, and their conservation has become a preoccupation of the Atlantic Provinces. On the West Coast, tuna stocks are now restricted. The less depleted (but still greatly diminished) salmon population continues to drive a strong fisheries industry. Canada claims 22 km (12 nmi) of territorial sea, a contiguous zone of 44 km (24 nmi), an exclusive economic zone of 5,599,077 km2 (2,161,816 sq mi) with 370 km (200 nmi) and a continental shelf of 370 km (200 nmi) or to the edge of the continental margin.\n\n\nFive per cent of Canada's land area is arable, none of which is for permanent crops. Three per cent of Canada's land area is covered by permanent pastures. Canada has 7,200 square kilometres (2,800 sq mi) of irrigated land (1993 estimate). Agricultural regions in Canada include the Canadian Prairies, the Lower Mainland and various regions within the Interior of British Columbia, the St. Lawrence Basin and the Canadian Maritimes. Main crops in Canada include flax, oats, wheat, maize, barley, sugar beets and rye in the prairies; flax and maize in Western Ontario; Oats and potatoes in the Maritimes. Fruit and vegetables are grown primarily in the Annapolis Valley of Nova Scotia, Southwestern Ontario, the Golden Horseshoe region of Ontario, along the south coast of Georgian Bay and in the Okanagan Valley of British Columbia. Cattle and sheep are raised in the valleys and plateaus of British Columbia. Cattle, sheep and hogs are raised on the prairies, cattle and hogs in Western Ontario, sheep and hogs in Quebec, and sheep in the Maritimes. There are significant dairy regions in central Nova Scotia, southern New Brunswick, the St. Lawrence Valley, northeastern Ontario, southwestern Ontario, the Red River valley of Manitoba and the valleys in the British Columbia Interior, on Vancouver Island and in the Lower Mainland.\n\n\n\n![](image)The bulk of oil and gas production occurs in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin (mostly light green), which stretches from southwestern Manitoba to northeastern British Columbia.\nFossil fuels are a more recently developed resource in Canada, with oil and gas being extracted from deposits in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin since the mid-1900s. While Canada's crude oil deposits are fewer, technological developments in recent decades have opened up oil production in Alberta's Oil Sands to the point where Canada now has some of the largest reserves of oil in the world. In other forms, Canadian industry has a long history of extracting large coal and natural gas reserves.\n\n\nCanada's mineral resources are diverse and extensive. Across the Canadian Shield and in the north there are large iron, nickel, zinc, copper, gold, lead, molybdenum, and uranium reserves. Large diamond concentrations have been recently developed in the Arctic, making Canada one of the world's largest producers. Throughout the Shield there are many mining towns extracting these minerals. The largest, and best known, is Sudbury, Ontario. Sudbury is an exception to the normal process of forming minerals in the Shield since there is significant evidence that the Sudbury Basin is an ancient meteorite impact crater. The nearby, but less known Temagami Magnetic Anomaly has striking similarities to the Sudbury Basin. Its magnetic anomalies are very similar to the Sudbury Basin, and so it could be a second metal-rich impact crater.[72] The Shield is also covered by vast boreal forests that support an important logging industry.\n\n\nCanada's many rivers have afforded extensive development of hydroelectric power. Extensively developed in British Columbia, Ontario, Quebec and Labrador, the many dams have long provided a clean, dependable source of energy.\n\n\n\n## Environmental issues[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Environmental issues in Canada\n\n![](image)Industry is a significant source of air pollution in Canada.\nAir pollution and resulting acid rain severely affects lakes and damages forests.[54] Metal smelting, coal-burning utilities, and vehicle emissions impact agricultural and forest productivity. Ocean waters are also becoming contaminated by agricultural, industrial, mining, and forestry activities.[54]\n\n\nGlobal climate change and the warming of the polar region will likely cause significant changes to the environment, including loss of the polar bear,[73] the exploration for resource then the extraction of these resources and an alternative transport route to the Panama Canal through the Northwest Passage.\n\n\nCanada is currently warming at twice the global average, and this is effectively irreversible.[74]\n\n\n\n## Political geography[edit]\n\n\nFor historical political boundaries of Canada, see Territorial evolution of Canada.\n\n![Labelled map of Canada detailing its provinces and territories](image)A political map of Canada showing its 10 provinces and 3 territories\nCanada is divided into ten provinces and three territories. According to Statistics Canada, 72.0 percent of the population is concentrated within 150 kilometres (93 mi) of the nation's southern border with the United States, 70.0% live south of the 49th parallel, and over 60 percent of the population lives along the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River between Windsor, Ontario, and Quebec City. This leaves the vast majority of Canada's territory as sparsely populated wilderness; Canada's population density is 3.5 people per square kilometre (9.1 people/sq mi), among the lowest in the world. Despite this, 79.7 percent of Canada's population resides in urban areas, where population densities are increasing.[75]\n\n\nCanada shares with the U.S. the world's longest binational border at 8,893 kilometres (5,526 mi); 2,477 kilometres (1,539 mi) are with Alaska. The Danish island dependency of Greenland lies to Canada's northeast, separated from the Canadian Arctic islands by Baffin Bay and Davis Strait. As of June 14, 2022, Canada shares a land border with Greenland on Hans Island.[76] The French islands of Saint Pierre and Miquelon lie off the southern coast of Newfoundland in the Gulf of St. Lawrence and have a maritime territorial enclave within Canada's exclusive economic zone.[77]\n\n\nCanada's geographic proximity to the United States has historically bound the two countries together in the political world as well. Canada's position between the Soviet Union (now Russia) and the U.S. was strategically important during the Cold War since the route over the North Pole and Canada was the fastest route by air between the two countries and the most direct route for intercontinental ballistic missiles. Since the end of the Cold War, there has been growing speculation that Canada's Arctic maritime claims may become increasingly important if global warming melts the ice enough to open the Northwest Passage.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n**BC**\n\n**AB**\n\n**SK**\n\n**MB**\n\n**ON**\n\n**QC**\n\n**NB**\n\n**PE**\n\n**NS**\n\n**NL**\n\n**YT**\n\n**NT**\n\n**NU**\n\n![Canadian Provinces and Territories](image)\nGeography by province\n\n* Atlas of Canada\n* *Canadian Geographic*\n* Canadian Rockies\n* Extreme points of North America\n* List of highest points of Canadian provinces and territories\n* National Parks of Canada\n* List of Ultras of Canada\n* Mountain peaks of Canada\n* Temperature in Canada\n* ![flag](image) Canada portal\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Canada\". *The World Factbook* (2024 ed.).

Canada stretches from the Atlantic Ocean in the east to the Pacific Ocean in the west; to the north lies the Arctic Ocean.[1] Greenland is to the northeast with a shared border on Hans Island. To the southeast Canada shares a maritime boundary with France's overseas collectivity of Saint Pierre and Miquelon, the last vestige of New France.[2] By total area (including its waters), Canada is the second-largest country in the world, after Russia. By land area alone, however, Canada ranks fourth, the difference being due to it having the world's largest proportion of fresh water lakes.[3] Of Canada's thirteen provinces and territories, only two are landlocked (Alberta and Saskatchewan) while the other eleven all directly border one of three oceans.\n\n\nCanada is home to the world's northernmost settlement, Canadian Forces Station Alert, on the northern tip of Ellesmere Island—latitude 82.5°N—which lies 817 kilometres (508 mi) from the North Pole.[4] Much of the Canadian Arctic is covered by ice and permafrost.[5] Canada has the longest coastline in the world, with a total length of 243,042 kilometres (151,019 mi);[6] additionally, its border with the United States is the world's longest land border, stretching 8,891 kilometres (5,525 mi).[7] Three of Canada's Arctic islands, Baffin Island, Victoria Island and Ellesmere Island, are among the ten largest in the world.[8]\n\n\nCanada can be divided into seven physiographic regions: the Canadian Shield, the interior plains, the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Lowlands, the Appalachian region, the Western Cordillera, Hudson Bay Lowlands and the Arctic Archipelago.[9] Canada is also divided into fifteen terrestrial and five marine ecozones,[10] encompassing over 80,000 classified species of life.[11] Since the end of the last glacial period, Canada has consisted of eight distinct forest regions, including extensive boreal forest on the Canadian Shield;[12] 42 percent of the land acreage of Canada is covered by forests (approximately 8 percent of the world's forested land), made up mostly of spruce, poplar and pine.[13] Canada has over 2,000,000 lakes—563 greater than 100 km2 (39 sq mi)—which is more than any other country, containing much of the world's fresh water.[14][15] There are also freshwater glaciers in the Canadian Rockies, the Coast Mountains and the Arctic Cordillera.[16] A recent global remote sensing analysis also suggested that there were 6,477 km2 of tidal flats in Canada, making it the 5th ranked country in terms of how much tidal flat occurs there.[17] Protected areas of Canada and National Wildlife Areas have been established to preserve ecosystems.[18]\n\n\nCanada is geologically active, having many earthquakes and potentially active volcanoes, notably the Mount Meager massif, Mount Garibaldi, Mount Cayley, and the Mount Edziza volcanic complex.[19] Average winter and summer high temperatures across Canada range from Arctic weather in the north, to hot summers in the southern regions, with four distinct seasons.\n\n\n\n\n## Physiography [edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of regions of Canada § Primary, secondary, and local geographic\n\nSee also: Geological history of North America\n\n![](image)Canada can be divided into seven physiographic regions: the Canadian Shield, the interior plains, the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Lowlands, the Appalachian region, the Western Cordillera, Hudson Bay Lowlands, and the Arctic Archipelago.\nCanada covers 9,984,670 km2 (3,855,100 sq mi) and a panoply of various geoclimatic regions, of which there are seven main regions.[9] Canada also encompasses vast maritime terrain, with the world's longest coastline of 243,042 kilometres (151,019 mi).[20] The physical geography of Canada is widely varied. Boreal forests prevail throughout the country, ice is prominent in northerly Arctic regions and through the Canadian Rocky Mountains, and the relatively flat Canadian Prairies in the southwest facilitate productive agriculture.[21] The Great Lakes feed the St. Lawrence River (in the southeast) where lowlands host much of Canada's population.\n\n\nThe National Topographic System is used by Natural Resources Canada for providing general purpose topographic maps of the country. The maps provide details on landforms and terrain, lakes and rivers, forested areas, administrative zones, populated areas, roads and railways, as well as other man-made features.[22] These maps are used by all levels of government and industry for forest fire and flood control (as well as other environmental issues), depiction of crop areas, right-of-way, real estate planning, development of natural resources and highway planning.[22]\n\n\n\n### Appalachian Mountains[edit]\n\n\nThe Appalachian mountain range extends from Alabama in southern United States through the Gaspé Peninsula and the Atlantic Provinces, creating rolling hills indented by river valleys.[23] It also runs through parts of southern Quebec.[23]\n\n\nThe Appalachian Mountains (more specifically the Chic-Choc, Notre Dame, and Long Range Mountains) are an old and eroded range of mountains, approximately 380 million years in age. Notable mountains in the Appalachians include Mount Jacques-Cartier (Quebec, 1,268 m or 4,160 ft), Mount Carleton (New Brunswick, 817 m or 2,680 ft), The Cabox (Newfoundland, 814 m or 2,671 ft).[24] Parts of the Appalachians are home to a rich endemic flora and fauna and are considered to have been nunataks during the last glaciation era.\n\n\n\n### Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Lowlands[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A map of the Great Lakes Basin showing the five sub-basins within. Left to right they are: Superior, including Nipigon's basin, (magenta); Michigan (cyan); Huron (pale green); Erie (yellow); Ontario (light coral).\nThe Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Lowlands, or simply St. Lawrence Lowlands, is a physiographic region of Eastern Canada that comprises a section of southern Ontario bounded on the north by the Canadian Shield and by three of the Great Lakes — Lake Huron, Lake Erie and Lake Ontario — and extends along the St. Lawrence River to the Strait of Belle Isle[25] and the Atlantic Ocean. The lowlands comprise three sub-regions that were created by intrusions from adjacent physiographic regions — the West Lowland, Central Lowland and East Lowland.[25] The West Lowland includes the Niagara Escarpment, extending from the Niagara River to the Bruce Peninsula and Manitoulin Island.[25] The Central Lowland stretches between the Ottawa River and the St. Lawrence River.[25] The East Lowland includes Anticosti Island, Îles de Mingan, and extends to the Strait of Belle Isle.\n\n\nThe St. Lawrence Lowlands is one of the most densely populated, prosperous and productive regions in Canada. Major urban areas include Toronto, Montreal, Ottawa-Gatineau and Quebec City. \n\n\n\nThe St. Lawrence Lowlands was covered by surficial deposits left by ice sheets following the Pleistocene glaciations.[25] It is the smallest of Canada's seven physiographic regions — the others being the Arctic Lands, the Cordillera, the Interior Plains, the Canadian Shield, the Hudson Bay Lowlands and the Appalachian Uplands — distinguished by topography and geology.[25] The boundaries of the area largely reflect that of the Mixedwood Plains Ecozone, the smallest of Canada's fifteen terrestrial ecozones.\n\n### Canadian Shield[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Canadian Shield\n\n![](image)The Canadian Shield is a broad region of Precambrian rock (pictured in shades of red)\nThe northeastern part of Alberta, northern parts of Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec, all of Labrador and the Great Northern Peninsula of Newfoundland, eastern mainland Northwest Territories, most of Nunavut's mainland and, of its Arctic Archipelago, Baffin Island and significant bands through Somerset, Southampton, Devon and Ellesmere islands are located on a vast rock base known as the Canadian Shield.[26] The Shield mostly consists of eroded hilly terrain and contains many lakes and important rivers used for hydroelectric production, particularly in northern Quebec and Ontario. The Shield also encloses an area of wetlands around the Hudson Bay. Some particular regions of the Shield are referred to as mountain ranges, including the Torngat and Laurentian Mountains.[27]\n\n\nThe Shield cannot support intensive agriculture, although there is subsistence agriculture and small dairy farms in many of the river valleys and around the abundant lakes, particularly in the southern regions. Boreal forest covers much of the shield, with a mix of conifers that provide valuable timber resources in areas such as the Central Canadian Shield forests ecoregion that covers much of Northern Ontario.\n\n\nThe Canadian Shield is known for its vast mineral reserves such as emeralds, diamonds and copper, and is there also called the \"mineral house\".[27]\n\n\n\n### Canadian Interior Plains[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Interior Plains\n![](image)Palliser's Triangle, delineating prairie soil types in the Prairie provinces.\nThe Canadian Prairies (usually referred to as simply the Prairies in Canada) is a region in Western Canada. It includes the Canadian portion of the Great Plains and the Prairie provinces, namely Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba.[28] These provinces are partially covered by grasslands, plains, and lowlands, mostly in the southern regions. The northernmost reaches of the Canadian Prairies are less dense in population, marked by forests and more variable topography.[29] If the region is defined to include areas only covered by prairie land, the corresponding region is known as the Interior Plains.[30] Physical or ecological aspects of the Canadian Prairies extend to northeastern British Columbia, but that area is not included in political use of the term.[31]\n\n\n\nThe prairies in Canada are a temperate grassland and shrubland biome within the prairie ecoregion of Canada that consists of northern mixed grasslands in Alberta, Saskatchewan, southern Manitoba, as well as northern short grasslands in southeastern Alberta and southwestern Saskatchewan.[32] The Prairies Ecozone of Canada includes the northern tall grasslands in southern Manitoba and Aspen parkland, which covers central Alberta, central Saskatchewan, and southern Manitoba.[33] The Prairie starts from north of Edmonton and it covers the three provinces in a southward-slanting line east to the Manitoba–Minnesota border.[34] Alberta has the most land classified as prairie, while Manitoba has the least, as the boreal forest begins more southerly in Manitoba than in Alberta.[35]\n\n### Canadian Arctic[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Arctic Archipelago\n\nWhile the largest part of the Canadian Arctic is composed of seemingly endless permafrost and tundra north of the tree line, it encompasses geological regions of varying types: the Arctic Cordillera (with the British Empire Range and the United States Range on Ellesmere Island) contains the northernmost mountain system in the world. The Arctic Lowlands and Hudson Bay lowlands comprise a substantial part of the geographic region often designated as the Canadian Shield (in contrast to the sole geologic area). The ground in the Arctic is mostly composed of permafrost, making construction difficult and often hazardous, and agriculture virtually impossible.[36]\n\n\nThe Arctic, when defined as everything north of the tree line, covers most of Nunavut and the northernmost parts of Northwest Territories, Yukon, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec and Labrador. The archipelago consists of 36,563 islands, of which 94 are classified as major islands, being larger than 130 km2 (50 sq mi), and cover a total area of 1,400,000 km2 (540,000 sq mi).[36]\n\n\n\n### Western Cordillera[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Pacific Cordillera (Canada)\n\n![](image)Map of the Hart Ranges in British Columbia\nThe Coast Mountains in British Columbia run from the lower Fraser River and the Fraser Canyon northwestward, separating the Interior Plateau from the Pacific Ocean.[37] Its southeastern end is separated from the North Cascades by the Fraser Lowland, where nearly a third of Western Canada's population reside.\n\n\nThe coastal flank of the Coast Mountains is characterized by an intense network of fjords and associated islands, very similar to the Norwegian coastline in Northern Europe; while their inland side transitions to the high plateau with dryland valleys notable for a series of large alpine lakes similar to those in southern Switzerland, beginning in deep mountains and ending in flatland. They are subdivided in three main groups, the Pacific Ranges between the Fraser River and Bella Coola, the Kitimat Ranges from there northwards to the Nass River, and the Boundary Ranges from there to the mountain terminus in Yukon at Champagne Pass and Chilkat Pass northwest of Haines, Alaska.[37] The Saint Elias Mountains lie to their west and northwest, while the Yukon Ranges and Yukon Basin lie to their north. On the inland side of the Boundary Ranges are the Tahltan and Tagish Highlands and also the Skeena Mountains, part of the Interior Mountains system, which also extend southwards on the inland side of the Kitimat Ranges.[37]\n\n\nThe terrain of the main spine of the Coast Mountains is typified by heavy glaciation, including several very large icefields of varying elevation. Of the three subdivisions, the Pacific Ranges are the highest and are crowned by Mount Waddington, while the Boundary Ranges contain the largest icefields, the Juneau Icefield being the largest. The Kitimat Ranges are lower and less glacier-covered than either of the other two groupings, but are extremely rugged and dense.\n\n\nThe Coast Mountains are made of igneous and metamorphic rock from an episode of arc volcanism related to subduction of the Kula and Farallon Plates during the Laramide orogeny about 100 million years ago.[38] The widespread granite forming the Coast Mountains formed when magma intruded and cooled at depth beneath volcanoes of the Coast Range Arc whereas the metamorphic formed when intruding magma heated the surrounding rock to produce schist.\n\n\nThe Insular Mountains extend from Vancouver Island in the south to the Haida Gwaii in the north on the British Columbia Coast. It contains two main mountain ranges, the Vancouver Island Ranges on Vancouver Island and the Queen Charlotte Mountains on Haida Gwaii.[39]\n\n\n\n### Hudson Bay Lowlands[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Hudson Bay Lowlands approximately coincide with the Southern Hudson Bay taiga ecoregion of North America.\nThe Hudson Bay Lowlands is a vast wetland located between the Canadian Shield and southern shores of Hudson Bay and James Bay. Most of the area lies within the province of Ontario, with smaller portions reaching into Manitoba and Quebec. Many wide and slow-moving rivers flow through this area toward the saltwater of Hudson Bay: these include the Churchill, Nelson and Hayes in Manitoba, Severn, Fawn, Winisk, Asheweig, Ekwan, Attawapiskat, and Albany in Ontario, and the Harricana, Rupert and Eastmain in Quebec.[40] This is the largest wetland in Canada, and one of the largest in the world.[41] The region can be subdivided into three bands running roughly northwest to southeast: the Coastal Hudson Bay Lowland (a narrow band along the northern coast),[42] Hudson Bay Lowland (a broader band extending to slightly south of the Ekwan River),[43] and James Bay Lowland (all the rest of the southern/eastern lands, making up close to 50% of the total Lowlands area).[44]\n\n\n\nThe entire area was covered by ice during the last glaciation, and the peatlands have accumulated over the last ten thousand years. Plants from more temperate regions mix with arctic species.[45] A majority of the wetland is peat bog, although salt marshes occur along the coast, and marshes and wet meadows occur along the major rivers. The wetlands provide important habitat for migratory birds including shorebirds (e.g., yellow rail) and waterfowl (e.g., snow geese). Large mammals include polar bears and wolverines.[41]\n\n#### Extreme points[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Extreme points of Canada\n\nSee also: Extreme points of Canadian provinces\n\n![](image)Topographic map\nThe northernmost point of land within the boundaries of Canada is Cape Columbia, Ellesmere Island, Nunavut 83°06′40″N 69°58′19″W﻿ / ﻿83.111°N 69.972°W﻿ / 83.111; -69.972﻿ (Cape Columbia, Nunavut).[46] The northernmost point of the Canadian mainland is Zenith Point on Boothia Peninsula, Nunavut 72°00′07″N 94°39′18″W﻿ / ﻿72.002°N 94.655°W﻿ / 72.002; -94.655﻿ (Zenith Point, Nunavut).[46] The southernmost point is Middle Island, in Lake Erie, Ontario (41°41′N 82°40′W); the southernmost water point lies just south of the island, on the Ontario–Ohio border (41°40′35″N). The southernmost point of the Canadian mainland is Point Pelee, Ontario 41°54′32″N 82°30′32″W﻿ / ﻿41.909°N 82.509°W﻿ / 41.909; -82.509﻿ (Point Pelee, Ontario).[46] The lowest point is sea level at 0 m,[47] whilst the highest point is Mount Logan, Yukon, at 5,959 m / 19,550 ft 60°34′01″N 140°24′18″W﻿ / ﻿60.567°N 140.405°W﻿ / 60.567; -140.405﻿ (Mount Logan, Yukon).[46]\n\n\nThe westernmost point is Boundary Peak 187 (60°18′22.929″N 141°00′7.128″W) at the southern end of the Yukon–Alaska border, which roughly follows 141°W but leans very slightly east as it goes North 60°18′04″N 141°00′36″W﻿ / ﻿60.301°N 141.010°W﻿ / 60.301; -141.010﻿ (Boundary Peak 187).[48][46] The easternmost point is Cape Spear, Newfoundland (47°31′N 52°37′W) 47°31′23″N 52°37′08″W﻿ / ﻿47.523°N 52.619°W﻿ / 47.523; -52.619﻿ (Cape Spear, Newfoundland).[46] The easternmost point of the Canadian mainland is Elijah Point, Cape St. Charles, Labrador (52°13′N 55°37′W) 52°13′01″N 55°37′16″W﻿ / ﻿52.217°N 55.621°W﻿ / 52.217; -55.621﻿ (Elijah Point, Labrador).[46]\n\n\nThe Canadian pole of inaccessibility is allegedly near Jackfish River, Alberta (59°2′N 112°49′W).[49] The furthest straight-line distance that can be travelled to Canadian points of land is between the southwest tip of Kluane National Park and Reserve (next to Mount Saint Elias) and Cripple Cove, Newfoundland (near Cape Race) at a distance of 3,005.60 nautical miles (5,566.37 km; 3,458.78 mi).\n\n\n\n## Climatology [edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Temperature in Canada\n\n![](image)Köppen climate classification types of Canada\nClimate varies widely from region to region. Winters can be harsh in many parts of the country, particularly in the interior and Prairie provinces, which experience a continental climate, where daily average temperatures are near −15 °C (5 °F), but can drop below −40 °C (−40 °F) with severe wind chills.[50] In non-coastal regions, snow can cover the ground for almost six months of the year, while in parts of the north snow can persist year-round. Coastal British Columbia has a temperate climate, with a mild and rainy winter. On the east and west coasts, average high temperatures are generally in the low 20s °C (70s °F), while between the coasts, the average summer high temperature ranges from 25 to 30 °C (77 to 86 °F), with temperatures in some interior locations occasionally exceeding 40 °C (104 °F).[51]\n\n\nMuch of Northern Canada is covered by ice and permafrost; however, the future of the permafrost is uncertain because the Arctic has been warming at three times the global average as a result of climate change in Canada.[52] Canada's annual average temperature over land has warmed by 1.7 °C (3.1 °F), with changes ranging from 1.1 to 2.3 °C (2.0 to 4.1 °F) in various regions, since 1948.[53] The rate of warming has been higher across the North and in the Prairies.[53] In the southern regions of Canada, air pollution from both Canada and the United States—caused by metal smelting, burning coal to power utilities, and vehicle emissions—has resulted in acid rain, which has severely impacted waterways, forest growth and agricultural productivity in Canada.[54]\n\n\n\n## Biogeography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Wildlife of Canada\n\n![](image)ELC Ecozones and ecoprovinces of Canada\nCanada is divided into fifteen major terrestrial and five marine ecozones, that are further subdivided into 53 ecoprovinces, 194 ecoregions, and 1,027 ecodistricts.[10] These eco-areas encompass over 80,000 classified species of Canadian wildlife, with an equal number yet to be formally recognized or discovered.[55] Due to pollution, loss of biodiversity, over-exploitation of commercial species, invasive species, and habitat loss, there are currently more than 800 wild life species at risk of being lost.[56]\n\n\nCanada's major biomes are the tundra, boreal forest, grassland, and temperate deciduous forest. British Columbia contains several smaller biomes, including; mountain forest which extends to Alberta, and a small temperate rainforest along the Pacific coast, the semi arid desert located in the Okanagan and alpine tundra in the higher mountainous regions.[57]\n\n\nOver half of Canada's landscape is intact and relatively free of human development.[58] Approximately half of Canada is covered by forest, totaling around 2.4 million km2 (0.93 million sq mi).[59] The boreal forest of Canada is considered to be the largest intact forest on earth, with around 300,000 square kilometres (120,000 sq mi) undisturbed by roads, cities or industry.[60] The Canadian Arctic tundra is the second-largest vegetation region in the country consisting of dwarf shrubs, sedges and grasses, mosses and lichens.[61]\n\n\nApproximately 12.1 percent of the nation's landmass and freshwater are conservation areas, including 11.4 percent designated as protected areas.[18] Approximately 13.8 percent of its territorial waters are conserved, including 8.9 percent designated as protected areas.[18]\n\n\n\n## Palaeogeography[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Volcanism of Canada and Geology of Canada\n\n![](image)Mount Edziza, a stratovolcano in northwestern British Columbia\n![](image)A topographic map of Canada, showing elevations shaded from green (lower) to brown (higher)\nVolcanic activity is a major part of the geology of Canada and is characterized by many types of volcanic landform, including lava flows, volcanic plateaus, lava domes, cinder cones, stratovolcanoes, shield volcanoes, submarine volcanoes, calderas, diatremes, and maars, along with less common volcanic forms such as tuyas and subglacial mounds.\n\n\nThough Canada's volcanic history dates back to the Precambrian eon, at least 3.11 billion years ago, when its part of the North American continent began to form,[62] volcanism continues to occur in Western and Northern Canada in modern times, where it forms part of an encircling chain of volcanoes and frequent earthquakes around the Pacific Ocean called the Pacific Ring of Fire.[63] Because volcanoes in Western and Northern Canada are in relatively remote and sparsely populated areas and their activity is less frequent than with other volcanoes around the Pacific Ocean, Canada is commonly thought to occupy a gap in the Ring of Fire between the volcanoes of the western United States to the south and the Aleutian volcanoes of Alaska to the north.[64] Even so, the mountainous landscapes of the Canadian provinces of Alberta, British Columbia, Yukon, and the Northwest Territories include more than 100 volcanoes that have been active during the past two million years and whose eruptions have claimed many lives.[64]\n\n\n\nVolcanic activity is responsible for many of Canada's geological and geographical features and mineralization, including the nucleus of the North American continent, known as the Canadian Shield. Volcanism has led to the formation of hundreds of volcanic areas and extensive lava formations across Canada. The country's different volcano and lava types originate from different tectonic settings and types of volcanic eruptions, ranging from passive lava eruptions to violent explosive eruptions. Canada has a rich record of very large volumes of magmatic rock called large igneous provinces, represented by deep-level plumbing systems consisting of giant dike swarms, sill provinces and layered intrusions.[65] The most capable large igneous provinces in Canada are Archean greenstone belts estimated at 3.8 to 2.5 billion years old, containing a rare volcanic rock called komatiite.[65]\n\n## Hydrography[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of rivers of Canada and Watersheds of North America\n\n![](image)Rivers of Canada\nCanada holds vast reserves of water: its rivers discharge nearly 7% of the world's renewable water supply,[66] Canada has over 2,000,000 lakes—563 greater than 100 square kilometres (39 sq mi)—which is more than any other country and has the third largest amount of glacier water.[67] Canada is also home to about twenty five percent (134.6 million ha) of the world's wetlands that support a vast array of local ecosystems.[68]\n\n\nCanada's waterways host forty-seven rivers of at least 600 kilometres (370 mi) in length, with the two longest being the Mackenzie River, that begins at Great Slave Lake and ends in the Arctic Ocean, with its drainage basin covering a large part of northwestern Canada, and the Saint Lawrence River, which drains the Great Lakes into the Gulf of St. Lawrence ending in the Atlantic Ocean. The Mackenzie, including its tributaries is over 4,200 kilometres (2,600 mi) in length and lies within the second largest drainage basin of North America, while the St. Lawrence 3,058 kilometres (1,900 mi) in length, drains the world's largest system of freshwater lakes.[69]\n\n\nThe Atlantic watershed drains the entirety of the Atlantic provinces (parts of the Quebec-Labrador border are fixed at the Atlantic Ocean-Arctic Ocean continental divide), most of inhabited Quebec and large parts of southern Ontario. It is mostly drained by the economically important St. Lawrence River and its tributaries, notably the Saguenay, Manicouagan, and Ottawa rivers. The Great Lakes and Lake Nipigon are also drained by the St. Lawrence. The Churchill River and Saint John River are other important elements of the Atlantic watershed in Canada.[70]\n\n\n\n![](image)Drainage basins of Canada\nThe Hudson Bay watershed drains over a third of Canada. It covers Manitoba, northern Ontario and Quebec, most of Saskatchewan, southern Alberta, southwestern Nunavut, and the southern half of Baffin Island. This basin is most important in fighting drought in the prairies and producing hydroelectricity, especially in Manitoba, northern Ontario and Quebec. Major elements of this watershed include Lake Winnipeg, Nelson River, the North Saskatchewan and South Saskatchewan Rivers, Assiniboine River, and Nettilling Lake on Baffin Island. Wollaston Lake lies on the boundary between the Hudson Bay and Arctic Ocean watersheds and drains into both. It is the largest lake in the world that naturally drains in two directions.[70]\n\n\nThe continental divide in the Rockies separates the Pacific watershed in British Columbia and Yukon from the Arctic and Hudson Bay watersheds. This watershed irrigates the agriculturally important areas of inner British Columbia (such as the Okanagan and Kootenay valleys), and is used to produce hydroelectricity. Major elements are the Yukon, Columbia and Fraser rivers.[70]\n\n\nThe northern parts of Alberta, Manitoba, and British Columbia, most of Northwest Territories and Nunavut, and parts of Yukon are drained by the Arctic watershed. This watershed has been little used for hydroelectricity, with the exception of the Mackenzie River. The Peace, Athabasca and Liard Rivers, as well as Great Bear Lake and Great Slave Lake (respectively the largest and second largest lakes wholly enclosed by Canada) are significant elements of the Arctic watershed. Each of these elements eventually merges with the Mackenzie, thereby draining the vast majority of the Arctic watershed.[70]\n\n\nThe southernmost part of Alberta drains into the Gulf of Mexico through the Milk River and its tributaries. The Milk River originates in the Rocky Mountains of Montana, then flows into Alberta, then returns into the United States, where it is drained by the Missouri River. A small area of southwestern Saskatchewan is drained by Battle Creek, which empties into the Milk River.[70]\n\n\n\n## Natural resources[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Economy of Canada\n\nCanada's abundance of natural resources is reflected in their continued importance in the economy of Canada. Major resource-based industries are fisheries, forestry, agriculture, petroleum products and mining.[71]\n\n\nThe fisheries industry has historically been one of Canada's strongest. Unmatched cod stocks on the Grand Banks of Newfoundland launched this industry in the 16th century. Today these stocks are nearly depleted, and their conservation has become a preoccupation of the Atlantic Provinces. On the West Coast, tuna stocks are now restricted. The less depleted (but still greatly diminished) salmon population continues to drive a strong fisheries industry. Canada claims 22 km (12 nmi) of territorial sea, a contiguous zone of 44 km (24 nmi), an exclusive economic zone of 5,599,077 km2 (2,161,816 sq mi) with 370 km (200 nmi) and a continental shelf of 370 km (200 nmi) or to the edge of the continental margin.\n\n\nFive per cent of Canada's land area is arable, none of which is for permanent crops. Three per cent of Canada's land area is covered by permanent pastures. Canada has 7,200 square kilometres (2,800 sq mi) of irrigated land (1993 estimate). Agricultural regions in Canada include the Canadian Prairies, the Lower Mainland and various regions within the Interior of British Columbia, the St. Lawrence Basin and the Canadian Maritimes. Main crops in Canada include flax, oats, wheat, maize, barley, sugar beets and rye in the prairies; flax and maize in Western Ontario; Oats and potatoes in the Maritimes. Fruit and vegetables are grown primarily in the Annapolis Valley of Nova Scotia, Southwestern Ontario, the Golden Horseshoe region of Ontario, along the south coast of Georgian Bay and in the Okanagan Valley of British Columbia. Cattle and sheep are raised in the valleys and plateaus of British Columbia. Cattle, sheep and hogs are raised on the prairies, cattle and hogs in Western Ontario, sheep and hogs in Quebec, and sheep in the Maritimes. There are significant dairy regions in central Nova Scotia, southern New Brunswick, the St. Lawrence Valley, northeastern Ontario, southwestern Ontario, the Red River valley of Manitoba and the valleys in the British Columbia Interior, on Vancouver Island and in the Lower Mainland.\n\n\n\n![](image)The bulk of oil and gas production occurs in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin (mostly light green), which stretches from southwestern Manitoba to northeastern British Columbia.\nFossil fuels are a more recently developed resource in Canada, with oil and gas being extracted from deposits in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin since the mid-1900s. While Canada's crude oil deposits are fewer, technological developments in recent decades have opened up oil production in Alberta's Oil Sands to the point where Canada now has some of the largest reserves of oil in the world. In other forms, Canadian industry has a long history of extracting large coal and natural gas reserves.\n\n\nCanada's mineral resources are diverse and extensive. Across the Canadian Shield and in the north there are large iron, nickel, zinc, copper, gold, lead, molybdenum, and uranium reserves. Large diamond concentrations have been recently developed in the Arctic, making Canada one of the world's largest producers. Throughout the Shield there are many mining towns extracting these minerals. The largest, and best known, is Sudbury, Ontario. Sudbury is an exception to the normal process of forming minerals in the Shield since there is significant evidence that the Sudbury Basin is an ancient meteorite impact crater. The nearby, but less known Temagami Magnetic Anomaly has striking similarities to the Sudbury Basin. Its magnetic anomalies are very similar to the Sudbury Basin, and so it could be a second metal-rich impact crater.[72] The Shield is also covered by vast boreal forests that support an important logging industry.\n\n\nCanada's many rivers have afforded extensive development of hydroelectric power. Extensively developed in British Columbia, Ontario, Quebec and Labrador, the many dams have long provided a clean, dependable source of energy.\n\n\n\n## Environmental issues[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Environmental issues in Canada\n\n![](image)Industry is a significant source of air pollution in Canada.\nAir pollution and resulting acid rain severely affects lakes and damages forests.[54] Metal smelting, coal-burning utilities, and vehicle emissions impact agricultural and forest productivity. Ocean waters are also becoming contaminated by agricultural, industrial, mining, and forestry activities.[54]\n\n\nGlobal climate change and the warming of the polar region will likely cause significant changes to the environment, including loss of the polar bear,[73] the exploration for resource then the extraction of these resources and an alternative transport route to the Panama Canal through the Northwest Passage.\n\n\nCanada is currently warming at twice the global average, and this is effectively irreversible.[74]\n\n\n\n## Political geography[edit]\n\n\nFor historical political boundaries of Canada, see Territorial evolution of Canada.\n\n![Labelled map of Canada detailing its provinces and territories](image)A political map of Canada showing its 10 provinces and 3 territories\nCanada is divided into ten provinces and three territories. According to Statistics Canada, 72.0 percent of the population is concentrated within 150 kilometres (93 mi) of the nation's southern border with the United States, 70.0% live south of the 49th parallel, and over 60 percent of the population lives along the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River between Windsor, Ontario, and Quebec City. This leaves the vast majority of Canada's territory as sparsely populated wilderness; Canada's population density is 3.5 people per square kilometre (9.1 people/sq mi), among the lowest in the world. Despite this, 79.7 percent of Canada's population resides in urban areas, where population densities are increasing.[75]\n\n\nCanada shares with the U.S. the world's longest binational border at 8,893 kilometres (5,526 mi); 2,477 kilometres (1,539 mi) are with Alaska. The Danish island dependency of Greenland lies to Canada's northeast, separated from the Canadian Arctic islands by Baffin Bay and Davis Strait. As of June 14, 2022, Canada shares a land border with Greenland on Hans Island.[76] The French islands of Saint Pierre and Miquelon lie off the southern coast of Newfoundland in the Gulf of St. Lawrence and have a maritime territorial enclave within Canada's exclusive economic zone.[77]\n\n\nCanada's geographic proximity to the United States has historically bound the two countries together in the political world as well. Canada's position between the Soviet Union (now Russia) and the U.S. was strategically important during the Cold War since the route over the North Pole and Canada was the fastest route by air between the two countries and the most direct route for intercontinental ballistic missiles. Since the end of the Cold War, there has been growing speculation that Canada's Arctic maritime claims may become increasingly important if global warming melts the ice enough to open the Northwest Passage.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n**BC**\n\n**AB**\n\n**SK**\n\n**MB**\n\n**ON**\n\n**QC**\n\n**NB**\n\n**PE**\n\n**NS**\n\n**NL**\n\n**YT**\n\n**NT**\n\n**NU**\n\n![Canadian Provinces and Territories](image)\nGeography by province\n\n* Atlas of Canada\n* *Canadian Geographic*\n* Canadian Rockies\n* Extreme points of North America\n* List of highest points of Canadian provinces and territories\n* National Parks of Canada\n* List of Ultras of Canada\n* Mountain peaks of Canada\n* Temperature in Canada\n* ![flag](image) Canada portal\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Canada\". *The World Factbook* (2024 ed.).

Metropolitan France has a total size of 551,695 km2 (213,011 sq mi) (Europe only). It is the third largest country in Europe by area (after Russia and Ukraine) and the largest in Western Europe.\n\n\n\n\n## Physical geography of Metropolitan France[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Köppen climate classification map of Metropolitan France\n![](image)Land use in Metropolitan France, with urban areas shown in red, 2006.\n![](image)Natural resources of France. Metals are in blue (Al — aluminium ore, Fe — iron ore, W — tungsten, Au — gold, U — uranium). Fossil fuels are in red (C — coal, L — lignite, P — petroleum, G — natural gas). Non-metallic minerals are in green (F — fluorite, K — potash, T — talc).\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nThe French metropolitan territory is relatively large, so the climate is not uniform, giving rise to the following climate nuances:\n\n\n\n* The cool semi-arid climate (*BSk*) concerns the western part of the Bouches-du-Rhône area and the Roussillon plain of the Pyrénées-Orientales with hot summers and cool winters with insufficient average annual rainfall in some years.\n* The hot-summer mediterranean climate (*Csa*) is found along the Gulf of Lion and further inland. Summers are hot and dry, winters are cool and the autumn season can be very rainy near the Cévennes.\n* The warm-summer mediterranean climate (*Csb*) is found in the northwestern part of Brittany and along the Gulf of Lion but higher in altitude, in the mountains. Summers are warm (but not hot) and dry, winters are cool and can be cold in the mountains, with rainy autumns.\n* The humid subtropical climate (*Cfa*) is found in southwestern France, in the Toulouse area. In France, the humid subtropical climate is not as hot and humid as in the southeastern United States. Summers are hot and wetter than in the mediterranean basin and winters are cool and somewhat foggy in the plains.\n* The oceanic climate (*Cfb*) concerns a large part of France, as far as Champagne and Burgundy and of course around the coasts of the Bay of Biscay, the English Channel and the North Sea. Summers are pleasantly warm (rarely hot), somewhat dry and winters are cool and wet.\n* The subalpine oceanic climate (*Cfc*) is found at the foot of the Pyrenees, Massif central and western French Alps as in the mountains of Vercors and Chartreuse. Summers are short, cool and wet and winters are moderately cold, long and snowy.\n* The warm-summer mediterranean continental climate (*Dsb*) is found in all the mountainous regions of Southern France between 700 and 1,400 metres a.s.l. Summers are pleasantly warm and dry while winters are very cold and snowy.\n* The cool-summer mediterranean continental climate (*Dsc*) is found in all the mountainous regions of Southern France between 1,400 and 2,300-2,400 metres a.s.l. Summers are cool, short and dry while winters are very cold and snowy.\n* The warm-summer humid continental climate (*Dfb*) is found in the far east of France or in all the mountain ranges, far from the ocean or the sea. Summers are warm to hot and stormy and winters are cold, somewhat dry and snow is not uncommon. Above 500–600 meters a.s.l in the northeastern quarter of France, the snowpack can persist throughout the winter. In January 1985, in Mouthe, the temperature has dropped under −41.2 °C (−42.2 °F).\n* The subalpine climate (*Dfc*) is found in all the mountainous regions of France between 1,100-1,400 meters a.s.l in the Vosges mountains and 1,400-2,300 metres a.s.l in the southern French Alps or in the Pyrenees. Summers are cool, short and stormy while winters are very cold, long and snowy.\n* The alpine tundra climate (*ET*) is found in all the mountainous regions of France, generally above 2,000 or 2,300-2,400 metres a.s.l depending on the mountain ranges. Summers are chilly, stormy and windy and winters are extremely cold, long and snowy.\n* The ice cap climate (*EF*) is found in all the mountainous regions of France that have a glacier, in the highest mountains of the Alps or the Pyrenees. The climate in the Mont Blanc massif (up to 4,810 meters a.s.l) is an ice cap climate for example. Summers are cold and wet and winters are extremely cold, long and snowy.\n\n\nClimate change in France includes above average heating.[1]\n\n\n\n### Elevation extremes[edit]\n\n\n* Lowest point: Étang de Lavalduc, Bouches-du-Rhône -10 m\n* Highest point: Mont Blanc 4,808 m See also: Evolution of highest point of France\n\n\n### Land use[edit]\n\n\n* *Arable land*: 33.40%\n* *Permanent crops*: 1.83%\n* *Other*: 64.77% (2007)\n\n\n*Irrigated land:* 26,420 km2 (2007)\n\n\n*Total renewable water resources:* 211 km3 (2011)\n\n\n*Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural):* 31.62 km3/yr (19%/71%/10%) (512.1 m3/yr per capita) (2009)\n\n\n\n### Natural resources[edit]\n\n\nCoal, iron ore, bauxite, zinc, uranium, antimony, arsenic, potash, feldspar, fluorspar, gypsum, timber, fish, gold, clay, petroleum, silver\n\n\n\n### Natural hazards[edit]\n\n\nFlooding, avalanches, midwinter windstorms, drought, forest fires in the south near the Mediterranean\n\n\n\n### Environment[edit]\n\n\nThe region that now comprises France consisted of open grassland during the Pleistocene Ice Age. France gradually became forested as the glaciers retreated starting in 10,000 BC, but clearing of these primeval forests began in Neolithic times. These forests were still fairly extensive until the medieval era.\n\n\nIn prehistoric times, France was home to large predatory animals such as wolves and brown bears, as well as herbivores such as elk. The larger fauna have disappeared outside the Pyrenees Mountains where bears live as a protected species. Smaller animals include martens, wild pigs, foxes, weasels, bats, rodents, rabbits, and assorted birds.\n\n\nBy the 15th century, France had largely been denuded of its forests and was forced to rely on Scandinavia and their North American colonies for lumber. Significant remaining forested areas are in the Gascony region and north in the Alsace-Ardennes area. The Ardennes Forest was the scene of extensive fighting in both world wars.\n\n\nThe north central part of this region is dominated by the Paris Basin, which consists of a layered sequence of sedimentary rocks. Fertile soils over much of the area make good agricultural land. The Normandy coast to the northwest is characterized by high, chalk cliffs, while the Brittany coast (the peninsula to the west) is highly indented where deep valleys were drowned by the sea, and the Biscay coast to the southwest is marked by flat, sandy beaches.\n\n\nA recent global remote sensing analysis suggested that there were 1,433 km2 of tidal flats in France, making it the 23rd ranked country in terms of tidal flat area.[2]\n\n\n\n* ![Forest in Sollières-Sardières (Natura 2000 site).](image)\n\nForest in Sollières-Sardières (Natura 2000 site).\n* ![Calanques National Park in Bouches-du-Rhône](image)\n\nCalanques National Park in Bouches-du-Rhône\n* ![Mont Blanc, the highest summit in Western Europe](image)\n\nMont Blanc, the highest summit in Western Europe\n* ![Étang de Lavalduc, the lowest point in France](image)\n\nÉtang de Lavalduc, the lowest point in France\n\n\n## Political geography[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

The first-level administrative division of Integral France is regions. Besides this the French Republic has sovereignty over several other territories, with various administrative levels. \n\n\n\n* Metropolitan (i.e. European) France is divided into 12 *régions* and 1 territorial collectivity, Corsica. However, Corsica is referred to as a region in common speech. These regions are subdivided into 96 *départements*, which are further divided into 320 arrondissements, which are further divided into 1,995 cantons, which are further divided into 34,836 communes (as of 1/1/2021).[3]\n* Five overseas regions (*régions d'outre-mer*, or *ROM*): Guadeloupe, French Guiana, Martinique, Mayotte, and Réunion, with identical status to metropolitan regions. Each of these overseas regions also being an overseas département (*département d'outre-mer*, or *DOM*), with the same status as a **département** of metropolitan France. This double structure (*région*/**département**) is new, due to the recent extension of the regional scheme to the overseas départements, and may soon transform into a single structure, with the merger of the regional and departmental assemblies. Another proposed change is that new *départements* are created such as in the case of Réunion, where it has been proposed to create a second **département** in the south of the island, with the *région* of Réunion above these two *départements*.\n* Four overseas collectivities (*collectivités d'outre-mer*, or *COM*): Saint-Pierre and Miquelon, Saint Barthélemy, Saint Martin, and Wallis and Futuna.\n* One overseas \"country\" (*pays d'outre-mer*, or *POM*): French Polynesia.

Metropolitan France has a total size of 551,695 km2 (213,011 sq mi) (Europe only). It is the third largest country in Europe by area (after Russia and Ukraine) and the largest in Western Europe.\n\n\n\n\n## Physical geography of Metropolitan France[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Köppen climate classification map of Metropolitan France\n![](image)Land use in Metropolitan France, with urban areas shown in red, 2006.\n![](image)Natural resources of France. Metals are in blue (Al — aluminium ore, Fe — iron ore, W — tungsten, Au — gold, U — uranium). Fossil fuels are in red (C — coal, L — lignite, P — petroleum, G — natural gas). Non-metallic minerals are in green (F — fluorite, K — potash, T — talc).\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nThe French metropolitan territory is relatively large, so the climate is not uniform, giving rise to the following climate nuances:\n\n\n\n* The cool semi-arid climate (*BSk*) concerns the western part of the Bouches-du-Rhône area and the Roussillon plain of the Pyrénées-Orientales with hot summers and cool winters with insufficient average annual rainfall in some years.\n* The hot-summer mediterranean climate (*Csa*) is found along the Gulf of Lion and further inland. Summers are hot and dry, winters are cool and the autumn season can be very rainy near the Cévennes.\n* The warm-summer mediterranean climate (*Csb*) is found in the northwestern part of Brittany and along the Gulf of Lion but higher in altitude, in the mountains. Summers are warm (but not hot) and dry, winters are cool and can be cold in the mountains, with rainy autumns.\n* The humid subtropical climate (*Cfa*) is found in southwestern France, in the Toulouse area. In France, the humid subtropical climate is not as hot and humid as in the southeastern United States. Summers are hot and wetter than in the mediterranean basin and winters are cool and somewhat foggy in the plains.\n* The oceanic climate (*Cfb*) concerns a large part of France, as far as Champagne and Burgundy and of course around the coasts of the Bay of Biscay, the English Channel and the North Sea. Summers are pleasantly warm (rarely hot), somewhat dry and winters are cool and wet.\n* The subalpine oceanic climate (*Cfc*) is found at the foot of the Pyrenees, Massif central and western French Alps as in the mountains of Vercors and Chartreuse. Summers are short, cool and wet and winters are moderately cold, long and snowy.\n* The warm-summer mediterranean continental climate (*Dsb*) is found in all the mountainous regions of Southern France between 700 and 1,400 metres a.s.l. Summers are pleasantly warm and dry while winters are very cold and snowy.\n* The cool-summer mediterranean continental climate (*Dsc*) is found in all the mountainous regions of Southern France between 1,400 and 2,300-2,400 metres a.s.l. Summers are cool, short and dry while winters are very cold and snowy.\n* The warm-summer humid continental climate (*Dfb*) is found in the far east of France or in all the mountain ranges, far from the ocean or the sea. Summers are warm to hot and stormy and winters are cold, somewhat dry and snow is not uncommon. Above 500–600 meters a.s.l in the northeastern quarter of France, the snowpack can persist throughout the winter. In January 1985, in Mouthe, the temperature has dropped under −41.2 °C (−42.2 °F).\n* The subalpine climate (*Dfc*) is found in all the mountainous regions of France between 1,100-1,400 meters a.s.l in the Vosges mountains and 1,400-2,300 metres a.s.l in the southern French Alps or in the Pyrenees. Summers are cool, short and stormy while winters are very cold, long and snowy.\n* The alpine tundra climate (*ET*) is found in all the mountainous regions of France, generally above 2,000 or 2,300-2,400 metres a.s.l depending on the mountain ranges. Summers are chilly, stormy and windy and winters are extremely cold, long and snowy.\n* The ice cap climate (*EF*) is found in all the mountainous regions of France that have a glacier, in the highest mountains of the Alps or the Pyrenees. The climate in the Mont Blanc massif (up to 4,810 meters a.s.l) is an ice cap climate for example. Summers are cold and wet and winters are extremely cold, long and snowy.\n\n\nClimate change in France includes above average heating.[1]\n\n\n\n### Elevation extremes[edit]\n\n\n* Lowest point: Étang de Lavalduc, Bouches-du-Rhône -10 m\n* Highest point: Mont Blanc 4,808 m See also: Evolution of highest point of France\n\n\n### Land use[edit]\n\n\n* *Arable land*: 33.40%\n* *Permanent crops*: 1.83%\n* *Other*: 64.77% (2007)\n\n\n*Irrigated land:* 26,420 km2 (2007)\n\n\n*Total renewable water resources:* 211 km3 (2011)\n\n\n*Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural):* 31.62 km3/yr (19%/71%/10%) (512.1 m3/yr per capita) (2009)\n\n\n\n### Natural resources[edit]\n\n\nCoal, iron ore, bauxite, zinc, uranium, antimony, arsenic, potash, feldspar, fluorspar, gypsum, timber, fish, gold, clay, petroleum, silver\n\n\n\n### Natural hazards[edit]\n\n\nFlooding, avalanches, midwinter windstorms, drought, forest fires in the south near the Mediterranean\n\n\n\n### Environment[edit]\n\n\nThe region that now comprises France consisted of open grassland during the Pleistocene Ice Age. France gradually became forested as the glaciers retreated starting in 10,000 BC, but clearing of these primeval forests began in Neolithic times. These forests were still fairly extensive until the medieval era.\n\n\nIn prehistoric times, France was home to large predatory animals such as wolves and brown bears, as well as herbivores such as elk. The larger fauna have disappeared outside the Pyrenees Mountains where bears live as a protected species. Smaller animals include martens, wild pigs, foxes, weasels, bats, rodents, rabbits, and assorted birds.\n\n\nBy the 15th century, France had largely been denuded of its forests and was forced to rely on Scandinavia and their North American colonies for lumber. Significant remaining forested areas are in the Gascony region and north in the Alsace-Ardennes area. The Ardennes Forest was the scene of extensive fighting in both world wars.\n\n\nThe north central part of this region is dominated by the Paris Basin, which consists of a layered sequence of sedimentary rocks. Fertile soils over much of the area make good agricultural land. The Normandy coast to the northwest is characterized by high, chalk cliffs, while the Brittany coast (the peninsula to the west) is highly indented where deep valleys were drowned by the sea, and the Biscay coast to the southwest is marked by flat, sandy beaches.\n\n\nA recent global remote sensing analysis suggested that there were 1,433 km2 of tidal flats in France, making it the 23rd ranked country in terms of tidal flat area.[2]\n\n\n\n* ![Forest in Sollières-Sardières (Natura 2000 site).](image)\n\nForest in Sollières-Sardières (Natura 2000 site).\n* ![Calanques National Park in Bouches-du-Rhône](image)\n\nCalanques National Park in Bouches-du-Rhône\n* ![Mont Blanc, the highest summit in Western Europe](image)\n\nMont Blanc, the highest summit in Western Europe\n* ![Étang de Lavalduc, the lowest point in France](image)\n\nÉtang de Lavalduc, the lowest point in France\n\n\n## Political geography[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

The first-level administrative division of Integral France is regions. Besides this the French Republic has sovereignty over several other territories, with various administrative levels. \n\n\n\n* Metropolitan (i.e. European) France is divided into 12 *régions* and 1 territorial collectivity, Corsica. However, Corsica is referred to as a region in common speech. These regions are subdivided into 96 *départements*, which are further divided into 320 arrondissements, which are further divided into 1,995 cantons, which are further divided into 34,836 communes (as of 1/1/2021).[3]\n* Five overseas regions (*régions d'outre-mer*, or *ROM*): Guadeloupe, French Guiana, Martinique, Mayotte, and Réunion, with identical status to metropolitan regions. Each of these overseas regions also being an overseas département (*département d'outre-mer*, or *DOM*), with the same status as a **département** of metropolitan France. This double structure (*région*/**département**) is new, due to the recent extension of the regional scheme to the overseas départements, and may soon transform into a single structure, with the merger of the regional and departmental assemblies.

Wetlands and marshy conditions are found close to the Dutch border and along the Frisian coast. Sandy Mecklenburg in the northeast has many glacier-formed lakes dating to the last glacial period.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGermany has a total of 2,389 km (1,484 mi) of coastline and borders totaling 3,714 km (2,308 mi) (clockwise from north: Denmark 140 km (87 mi), Poland 467 km (290 mi), Czech Republic 704 km (437 mi),[24] Austria 801 km (498 mi), Switzerland 348 km (216 mi), France 418 km (260 mi), Luxembourg 128 km (80 mi), Belgium 133 km (83 mi), Netherlands 575 km (357 mi)). The German-Austrian border crosses itself near Jungholz. The border with Belgium includes five German exclaves due to the Vennbahn railway line. The border with Switzerland includes the German exclave village of Büsingen am Hochrhein which is separated from the rest of Germany by a strip of Swiss territory 680 metres wide at its narrowest point.\n\n\n\n### Rivers[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The major German rivers\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of rivers of Germany.\n\nThe main rivers in Germany are:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGermany comprises sixteen states that are collectively referred to as *Länder*.[31] \nEach state has its own state constitution[32] and is largely autonomous in regard to its internal organisation. Due to differences in size and population the subdivision of these states varies, especially between city states (*Stadtstaaten*) and states with larger territories (*Flächenländer*). For regional administrative purposes five states, namely Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Hesse, North Rhine-Westphalia and Saxony, consist of a total of 22 Government Districts (*Regierungsbezirke*). As of July 2021 Germany is divided into 400 districts (*Kreise*) on municipal level, these consist of 294 rural districts and 106 urban districts.[33][34]\n\n\n\n![](image)\n![Lower Saxony](image) Lower Saxony\n\n![Free Hanseatic City of Bremen](image) Bremen\n\n![Hamburg](image) Hamburg\n\n![Mecklenburg-Vorpommern](image) Mecklenburg-  \nVorpommern\n\n![Saxony-Anhalt](image) Saxony-  \nAnhalt\n\n![Saxony](image) Saxony\n\n![Brandenburg](image) Brandenburg\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSouthern Germany's landforms are defined by various linear hill and mountain ranges like the two adjacent ranges of the Swabian and Franconian Alb (reaching approximately from the source of the Danube in the southwest of Baden-Württemberg, south of Stuttgart, across Swabia into Central Franconia and to the valley of the river Main) and the Bavarian Forest along the border between Bavaria and the Czech Republic. The Alps on the southern border are the highest mountains, but relatively little Alpine terrain lies within Germany (in southeastern Swabia and Upper Bavaria) compared to Switzerland and Austria. The Black Forest, on the southwestern border with France, separates the Rhine from the headwaters of the Danube on its eastern slopes.\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n![Coastal dunes](image)\nSummer coastal climate on the island of Sylt in Schleswig-Holstein\n![Thuringian Forest](image)\nThuringian Forests in winter\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPhytogeographically, Germany is shared between the Atlantic European and Central European provinces of the Circumboreal Region within the Boreal Kingdom. The territory of Germany can be subdivided into two ecoregions: European-Mediterranean montane mixed forests and Northeast-Atlantic shelf marine.[26] The majority of Germany is covered by either arable land (33%) or forestry and woodland (31%). Only 15% is covered by permanent pastures.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* The Rhine (*Rhein* in German) with a German section extending 865 km (537 mi) (main tributaries including the Neckar, the Main and the Moselle (*Mosel*));\n* The Elbe with a German section of 727 km (452 mi) (also drains into the North Sea); and\n* The Danube (*Donau*) with a German length of 687 km (427 mi).\n\n\nFurther important rivers include the Saale and the Main in central Germany, the Neckar in the southwest, the Weser in the North and the Oder at the eastern border.\n\n\n\n### Caves[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Show caves in Germany\nThroughout the Karst rocks many caves were formed especially in the valley of the Hönne.

Besides that, there is a strong west–east cline in temperature. This is explained by the northwestern Germany's flat and open landscapes and its closeness to the sea, and South's higher terrain, larger distance from the sea, and the Alps. These mountains prevent much of the usually warmer Mediterranean air blowing into southern Germany. To the north of the Alps and the Carpathians, the local climate becomes colder, even at the same latitude and altitude. This is caused by some areas being further away from the Atlantic Ocean's Gulf Stream, known for having a warm current for its latitude, in addition to being closer to Russia's and Siberia's extremely cold winter winds. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nEven if Siberian winter winds are not dominating, when they do hit Germany, temperatures can in extreme cases fall to -20 C in the mountains and below during the nights, and this has an effect on the average temperatures of November to March. Although rare, when such cold air reaches Germany, the North-Eastern parts become mainly affected, while the Southwest receives few cold days in general. The Gulf Stream results in the coast having the mildest nights in the winter, almost never freezing.\n\n\nThe warmest area in Germany is the area bordering France, west of the Schwarzwald hills, roughly between Mannheim to the north and the Swiss border to the south. The coldest area (except for mountain peaks) is found in the southeastern parts of eastern Germany around Dresden and Görlitz up to Berlin.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | 0.0(32.0)\n | 0.1(32.2)\n | 2.0(35.6)\n | 4.5(40.1)\n | 8.1(46.6)\n | 11.2(52.2)\n | 13.3(55.9)\n | 12.8(55.0)\n | 9.7(49.5)\n | 6.8(44.2)\n | 3.5(38.3)\n | 1.0(33.8)\n | 6.1(42.9)\n |\n| Mean minimum °C (°F)\n | −9.1(15.6)\n | −8.0(17.6)\n | −5.3(22.5)\n | −3.1(26.4)\n | 0.9(33.6)\n | 5.2(41.4)\n | 7.7(45.9)\n | 6.9(44.4)\n | 3.7(38.7)\n | −0.8(30.6)\n | −3.8(25.2)\n | −7.1(19.2)\n | −11.8(10.8)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | −23.4(−10.1)\n | −19.2(−2.6)\n | −13.4(7.9)\n | −8.8(16.2)\n | −2.9(26.8)\n | −0.5(31.1)\n | 2.9(37.2)\n | 1.9(35.4)\n | −1.3(29.7)\n | −6.0(21.2)\n | −10.4(13.3)\n | −18.0(−0.4)\n | −23.4(−10.1)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 61.7(2.43)\n | 53.8(2.12)\n | 55.0(2.17)\n | 48.2(1.90)\n | 62.1(2.44)\n | 86.3(3.40)\n | 87.4(3.44)\n | 83.3(3.28)\n | 66.9(2.63)\n | 64.7(2.55)\n | 63.5(2.50)\n | 69.2(2.72)\n | 802.1(31.58)\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 54.3\n | 78.8\n | 124.8\n | 172.6\n | 198.7\n | 201.3\n | 207.2\n | 196.5\n | 149.4\n | 104.5\n | 58.9\n | 45.2\n | 1,592.2\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMoving south, central Germany features rough and somewhat patternless hilly and mountainous countryside, some of it formed by ancient volcanic activity. The Rhine valley cuts through the western part of this region. The central uplands continue east and north as far as the Saale and merge with the Ore Mountains on the border with the Czech Republic. Upland regions include the Eifel, Hunsrück and Palatine Forest west of the Rhine, the Taunus hills north of Frankfurt, the Vogelsberg massif, the Rhön, and the Thuringian Forest. South of Berlin, the east-central part of the country is more like the low northern areas, with sandy soil and river wetlands such as the Spreewald region.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe plants and animals of Germany are those generally common to central Europe. Beeches, oaks, and other deciduous trees constitute one-third of the forests; conifers are increasing as a result of reforestation. Spruce and fir trees predominate in the upper mountains, while pine and larch are found in sandy soil. There are many species of ferns, flowers, fungi, and mosses. Fish abound in the rivers and the North Sea. Wild animals include deer, wild boar, mouflon, fox, badger, hare, Eurasian lynx, and small numbers of beaver. Extinct/endangered animals include gray wolf, brown bear, and European bison. Various migratory birds cross Germany in the spring and autumn.\n\n\nThe national parks in Germany include the Wadden Sea National Parks, the Jasmund National Park, the Vorpommern Lagoon Area National Park, the Müritz National Park, the Lower Oder Valley National Park, the Harz National Park, the Saxon Switzerland National Park and the Bavarian Forest National Park.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Geography of Germany.\n\n* Kostenlose Deutschland-Karten\n* Geoberg.de: Geologie Deutschlands – Fotografien geologischer Objekte aus Deutschland\n* mineralienatlas.de: Reiches Erz aus dem Harz\n* Deutscher Klimaatlas\n* Geography of Germany – Encyclopedia of World Geography\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nGermany articles\n |\n| --- |\n| General  History | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGermany's climate is temperate and marine in the west and humid continental in the east. It has cool winters in the west and cold winters in the east. It has moderate rainfall year-round and is mostly overcast from November to February. Summers are warm, more so in the south. The north and centre of Germany lies fully in the temperate climatic zone in which humid westerly winds predominate. In the northwest and the north, the climate is oceanic. Winters there are cool and summers warm. In the east, the climate shows clear continental features; winters are cold and summers warm. Dry periods are often recorded.\n\n\nIn the centre and the south, there is a transitional climate between oceanic or continental. Winters are cool and summers warm, though maximum temperatures can exceed 30 °C (86 °F) for several days in a row during heat waves.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n9. **^** \"Ausgabe der Klimadaten: Monatswerte\".

The area of Germany ranked 63rd and covers 357,021 km2 (137,847 sq mi), consisting of 349,223 km2 (134,836 sq mi) of land and 7,798 km2 (3,011 sq mi) of waters, smaller than Japan but larger than Republic of the Congo.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nElevation ranges from the mountains of the Alps (highest point: the Zugspitze at 2,962 metres (9,718 ft)) in the south to the shores of the North Sea (Nordsee) in the northwest and the Baltic Sea (Ostsee) in the northeast. Between lie the forested uplands of central Germany and the low-lying lands of northern Germany (lowest point: Neuendorf-Sachsenbande at 3.54 metres (11.6 ft) below sea level), traversed by some of Europe's major rivers such as the Rhine, Danube and Elbe.[4]\n\n\nGermany has the second-most borders of any European country, after Russia. It shares borders with nine countries: Denmark in the north, Poland and the Czech Republic in the east, Switzerland (its only non-EU neighbor) and Austria in the south, France in the southwest and Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands in the west. Germany also shares a maritime border with Sweden in the north and the United Kingdom in the northwest.\n\n\n\n\n## Area[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nClimate of Europe\n |\n| --- |\n| Sovereign states | * Albania\n* Andorra\n* Armenia\n* Austria\n* Azerbaijan\n* Belarus\n* Belgium\n* Bosnia and Herzegovina\n* Bulgaria\n* Croatia\n* Cyprus\n* Czech Republic\n* Denmark\n* Estonia\n* Finland\n* France\n* Georgia\n* Germany\n* Greece\n* Hungary\n* Iceland\n* Ireland\n* \n* Italy\n* Kazakhstan\n* Latvia\n* Liechtenstein\n* Lithuania\n* Luxembourg\n* Malta\n* Moldova\n* Monaco\n* Montenegro\n* Netherlands\n* North Macedonia\n* Norway\n* Poland\n* Portugal\n* Romania\n* Russia\n* San Marino\n* Serbia\n* Slovakia\n* Slovenia\n* Spain\n* Sweden\n* Switzerland\n* Turkey\n* Ukraine\n* United Kingdom\n* Vatican City\n |\n| States with limitedrecognition | * Abkhazia\n* Kosovo\n* Northern Cyprus\n* South Ossetia\n* Transnistria\n |\n| Dependencies andother entities | * Åland\n* Faroe Islands\n* Gibraltar\n* Guernsey\n* Isle of Man\n* Jersey\n* Svalbard\n |\n| Other entities | * European Union\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWith an estimated 83.2 million inhabitants in December 2020, Germany is the most populous country in the European Union and ranks as the 19th largest country in the world in terms of population.

Sandy Mecklenburg in the northeast has many glacier-formed lakes dating to the last glacial period.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGermany has a total of 2,389 km (1,484 mi) of coastline and borders totaling 3,714 km (2,308 mi) (clockwise from north: Denmark 140 km (87 mi), Poland 467 km (290 mi), Czech Republic 704 km (437 mi),[24] Austria 801 km (498 mi), Switzerland 348 km (216 mi), France 418 km (260 mi), Luxembourg 128 km (80 mi), Belgium 133 km (83 mi), Netherlands 575 km (357 mi)). The German-Austrian border crosses itself near Jungholz. The border with Belgium includes five German exclaves due to the Vennbahn railway line. The border with Switzerland includes the German exclave village of Büsingen am Hochrhein which is separated from the rest of Germany by a strip of Swiss territory 680 metres wide at its narrowest point.\n\n\n\n### Rivers[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The major German rivers\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of rivers of Germany.\n\nThe main rivers in Germany are:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGermany comprises sixteen states that are collectively referred to as *Länder*.[31] \nEach state has its own state constitution[32] and is largely autonomous in regard to its internal organisation. Due to differences in size and population the subdivision of these states varies, especially between city states (*Stadtstaaten*) and states with larger territories (*Flächenländer*). For regional administrative purposes five states, namely Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Hesse, North Rhine-Westphalia and Saxony, consist of a total of 22 Government Districts (*Regierungsbezirke*). As of July 2021 Germany is divided into 400 districts (*Kreise*) on municipal level, these consist of 294 rural districts and 106 urban districts.[33][34]\n\n\n\n![](image)\n![Lower Saxony](image) Lower Saxony\n\n![Free Hanseatic City of Bremen](image) Bremen\n\n![Hamburg](image) Hamburg\n\n![Mecklenburg-Vorpommern](image) Mecklenburg-  \nVorpommern\n\n![Saxony-Anhalt](image) Saxony-  \nAnhalt\n\n![Saxony](image) Saxony\n\n![Brandenburg](image) Brandenburg\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSouthern Germany's landforms are defined by various linear hill and mountain ranges like the two adjacent ranges of the Swabian and Franconian Alb (reaching approximately from the source of the Danube in the southwest of Baden-Württemberg, south of Stuttgart, across Swabia into Central Franconia and to the valley of the river Main) and the Bavarian Forest along the border between Bavaria and the Czech Republic. The Alps on the southern border are the highest mountains, but relatively little Alpine terrain lies within Germany (in southeastern Swabia and Upper Bavaria) compared to Switzerland and Austria. The Black Forest, on the southwestern border with France, separates the Rhine from the headwaters of the Danube on its eastern slopes.\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n![Coastal dunes](image)\nSummer coastal climate on the island of Sylt in Schleswig-Holstein\n![Thuringian Forest](image)\nThuringian Forests in winter\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPhytogeographically, Germany is shared between the Atlantic European and Central European provinces of the Circumboreal Region within the Boreal Kingdom. The territory of Germany can be subdivided into two ecoregions: European-Mediterranean montane mixed forests and Northeast-Atlantic shelf marine.[26] The majority of Germany is covered by either arable land (33%) or forestry and woodland (31%).

The biggest culture cave of Europe is located in Balve.\n\n\n\n### Tidal flats[edit]\n\n\nA recent global remote sensing analysis suggested that there were 2,783 km2 of tidal flats in Germany, making it the 11th ranked country in terms of how much tidal flat occurs there.[25]\n\n\n\n### Natural resources[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![Berlin](image) Berlin\n\n![Thuringia](image) Thuringia\n\n![Hesse](image) Hesse\n\n![North Rhine-Westphalia](image) North Rhine-  \nWestphalia\n\n![Rhineland-Palatinate](image) Rhineland-Palatinate\n\n![Bavaria](image) Bavaria\n\n![Baden-Württemberg](image) Baden-  \nWürttemberg\n\n![Saarland](image) Saarland\n\n![Schleswig-Holstein](image) Schleswig-Holstein\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nGeographical features of Germany\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Zugspitze is the highest elevation in Germany.\n* Northernmost point: List, Sylt, Schleswig-Holstein 55°03′N 8°24′E﻿ / ﻿55.050°N 8.400°E﻿ / 55.050; 8.400﻿ (List on Sylt (Northernmost point))\n* Northernmost point in mainland Germany: Rodenäs, Schleswig-Holstein 54°54′N 8°49′E﻿ / ﻿54.900°N 8.817°E﻿ / 54.900; 8.817﻿ (Aventoft (northernmost on continent))\n* Southernmost point: Haldenwanger Eck, Oberstdorf, Bavaria 47°16′12.39″N 10°10′41.95″E﻿ / ﻿47.2701083°N 10.1783194°E﻿ / 47.2701083; 10.1783194﻿ (Haldenwanger Eck at Oberstdorf (Southernmost point))\n* Westernmost point: Isenbruch, Selfkant, North Rhine-Westphalia 51°3′N 5°52′E﻿ / ﻿51.050°N 5.867°E﻿ / 51.050; 5.867﻿ (Isenbruch near Millen (Westernmost point))\n* Easternmost point: Deschka, Neißeaue, Saxony 51°16′N 15°2′E﻿ / ﻿51.267°N 15.033°E﻿ / 51.267; 15.033﻿ (Deschka (Easternmost point))\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| State | Capital | Area (km2) | Population[35] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Baden-Württemberg | Stuttgart | 35,752 | 11,103,043\n |\n| Bavaria | Munich | 70,549 | 13,140,183\n |\n| Berlin | Berlin | 892 | 3,664,088\n |\n| Brandenburg | Potsdam | 29,477 | 2,531,071\n |\n| Bremen | Bremen | 404 | 680,130\n |\n| Hamburg | Hamburg | 755 | 1,852,478\n |\n| Hesse | Wiesbaden | 21,115 | 6,293,154\n |\n| Mecklenburg-Vorpommern | Schwerin | 23,174 | 1,610,774\n |\n| Lower Saxony | Hanover | 47,618 | 8,003,421\n |\n| North Rhine-Westphalia | Düsseldorf | 34,043 | 17,925,570\n |\n| Rhineland-Palatinate | Mainz | 19,847 | 4,098,391\n |\n| Saarland | Saarbrücken | 2,569 | 983,991\n |\n| Saxony | Dresden | 18,416 | 4,056,941\n |\n| Saxony-Anhalt | Magdeburg | 20,445 | 2,180,684\n |\n| Schleswig-Holstein | Kiel | 15,763 | 2,910,875\n |\n| Thuringia | Erfurt | 16,172 | 2,120,237\n |\n\n |\n\n\n### Urbanization[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of cities in Germany; List of cities in Germany with more than 100,000 inhabitants; and Metropolitan regions in Germany\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n25. **^** Murray, N.J.; Phinn, S.R.; DeWitt, M.; Ferrari, R.; Johnston, R.; Lyons, M.B.; Clinton, N.; Thau, D.; Fuller, R.A.

Besides that, there is a strong west–east cline in temperature. This is explained by the northwestern Germany's flat and open landscapes and its closeness to the sea, and South's higher terrain, larger distance from the sea, and the Alps. These mountains prevent much of the usually warmer Mediterranean air blowing into southern Germany. To the north of the Alps and the Carpathians, the local climate becomes colder, even at the same latitude and altitude. This is caused by some areas being further away from the Atlantic Ocean's Gulf Stream, known for having a warm current for its latitude, in addition to being closer to Russia's and Siberia's extremely cold winter winds. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nEven if Siberian winter winds are not dominating, when they do hit Germany, temperatures can in extreme cases fall to -20 C in the mountains and below during the nights, and this has an effect on the average temperatures of November to March. Although rare, when such cold air reaches Germany, the North-Eastern parts become mainly affected, while the Southwest receives few cold days in general. The Gulf Stream results in the coast having the mildest nights in the winter, almost never freezing.\n\n\nThe warmest area in Germany is the area bordering France, west of the Schwarzwald hills, roughly between Mannheim to the north and the Swiss border to the south. The coldest area (except for mountain peaks) is found in the southeastern parts of eastern Germany around Dresden and Görlitz up to Berlin.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | 0.0(32.0)\n | 0.1(32.2)\n | 2.0(35.6)\n | 4.5(40.1)\n | 8.1(46.6)\n | 11.2(52.2)\n | 13.3(55.9)\n | 12.8(55.0)\n | 9.7(49.5)\n | 6.8(44.2)\n | 3.5(38.3)\n | 1.0(33.8)\n | 6.1(42.9)\n |\n| Mean minimum °C (°F)\n | −9.1(15.6)\n | −8.0(17.6)\n | −5.3(22.5)\n | −3.1(26.4)\n | 0.9(33.6)\n | 5.2(41.4)\n | 7.7(45.9)\n | 6.9(44.4)\n | 3.7(38.7)\n | −0.8(30.6)\n | −3.8(25.2)\n | −7.1(19.2)\n | −11.8(10.8)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | −23.4(−10.1)\n | −19.2(−2.6)\n | −13.4(7.9)\n | −8.8(16.2)\n | −2.9(26.8)\n | −0.5(31.1)\n | 2.9(37.2)\n | 1.9(35.4)\n | −1.3(29.7)\n | −6.0(21.2)\n | −10.4(13.3)\n | −18.0(−0.4)\n | −23.4(−10.1)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 61.7(2.43)\n | 53.8(2.12)\n | 55.0(2.17)\n | 48.2(1.90)\n | 62.1(2.44)\n | 86.3(3.40)\n | 87.4(3.44)\n | 83.3(3.28)\n | 66.9(2.63)\n | 64.7(2.55)\n | 63.5(2.50)\n | 69.2(2.72)\n | 802.1(31.58)\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 54.3\n | 78.8\n | 124.8\n | 172.6\n | 198.7\n | 201.3\n | 207.2\n | 196.5\n | 149.4\n | 104.5\n | 58.9\n | 45.2\n | 1,592.2\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMoving south, central Germany features rough and somewhat patternless hilly and mountainous countryside, some of it formed by ancient volcanic activity. The Rhine valley cuts through the western part of this region. The central uplands continue east and north as far as the Saale and merge with the Ore Mountains on the border with the Czech Republic. Upland regions include the Eifel, Hunsrück and Palatine Forest west of the Rhine, the Taunus hills north of Frankfurt, the Vogelsberg massif, the Rhön, and the Thuringian Forest. South of Berlin, the east-central part of the country is more like the low northern areas, with sandy soil and river wetlands such as the Spreewald region.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe plants and animals of Germany are those generally common to central Europe. Beeches, oaks, and other deciduous trees constitute one-third of the forests; conifers are increasing as a result of reforestation. Spruce and fir trees predominate in the upper mountains, while pine and larch are found in sandy soil. There are many species of ferns, flowers, fungi, and mosses. Fish abound in the rivers and the North Sea. Wild animals include deer, wild boar, mouflon, fox, badger, hare, Eurasian lynx, and small numbers of beaver. Extinct/endangered animals include gray wolf, brown bear, and European bison. Various migratory birds cross Germany in the spring and autumn.\n\n\nThe national parks in Germany include the Wadden Sea National Parks, the Jasmund National Park, the Vorpommern Lagoon Area National Park, the Müritz National Park, the Lower Oder Valley National Park, the Harz National Park, the Saxon Switzerland National Park and the Bavarian Forest National Park.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Geography of Germany.\n\n* Kostenlose Deutschland-Karten\n* Geoberg.de: Geologie Deutschlands – Fotografien geologischer Objekte aus Deutschland\n* mineralienatlas.de: Reiches Erz aus dem Harz\n* Deutscher Klimaatlas\n* Geography of Germany – Encyclopedia of World Geography\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nGermany articles\n |\n| --- |\n| General  History | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGermany's climate is temperate and marine in the west and humid continental in the east. It has cool winters in the west and cold winters in the east. It has moderate rainfall year-round and is mostly overcast from November to February. Summers are warm, more so in the south. The north and centre of Germany lies fully in the temperate climatic zone in which humid westerly winds predominate. In the northwest and the north, the climate is oceanic. Winters there are cool and summers warm. In the east, the climate shows clear continental features; winters are cold and summers warm. Dry periods are often recorded.\n\n\nIn the centre and the south, there is a transitional climate between oceanic or continental. Winters are cool and summers warm, though maximum temperatures can exceed 30 °C (86 °F) for several days in a row during heat waves.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n9. **^** \"Ausgabe der Klimadaten: Monatswerte\".

Summers are hot with many days up to 40 °C (104 °F). Sometimes, minimum temperatures do not drop below 20 °C (68 °F), which is relatively rare in other regions, except the North Sea coast and western city climates.[6][7]\n\n\nThe recorded extremes are a maximum of 41.2 °C (106.2 °F) (July 2019, Duisburg-Bearl & Tönisvorst),[*citation needed*] and a minimum of −37.8 °C (−36.0 °F) (February 1929, in Pfaffenhofen an der Ilm).[8]\n\n\n\n####

It lies between latitudes 35° and 47° N, and longitudes 6° and 19° E. Italy borders Switzerland (698 km or 434 mi), France (476 km or 296 mi), Austria (404 km or 251 mi) and Slovenia (218 km or 135 mi). San Marino (37 km or 23 mi) and Vatican City (3.4 km or 2.1 mi) are enclaves. The total border length is 1,836.4 km (1,141.1 mi). Including islands, Italy has a coastline of 7,900 km (4,900 mi) on the Adriatic Sea, Ionian Sea, Tyrrhenian Sea, Ligurian Sea, Sea of Sardinia and Strait of Sicily.\n\n\nThe Italian geographical region,[2][3] in its traditional and most widely accepted extent, has an area of approximately 324,000 square kilometres (125,000 sq mi),[2] which is greater than the area of the entire Italian Republic (301,230 square kilometres or 116,310 square miles). The Italian geographical region also includes territories that are sovereign parts of Croatia, France, Slovenia and Switzerland, as well as the four small independent states of the Principality of Monaco, the Republic of Malta, the Republic of San Marino and the Vatican City State (the Holy See).[4]\n\n\n\n\n## General features[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Satellite image of Italy.\nItaly is joined to the central-western section of the European continent by the Alps. Due to its position, it constitutes a bridge between Europe and Africa. In particular, the Italian peninsula is located in the center of the Mediterranean Sea, between the Balkans and Hellenic peninsula to the east, the Iberian peninsula to the west, North Africa to the south and continental Europe to the north separated by the Alps.\n\n\nItaly also separates the western basin of the Mediterranean Sea from the eastern basin — that is, the Tyrrhenian Sea from the Ionian Sea — extending towards the west with Calabria and Sicily, which together geologically form a peninsular extension. Only 140 km (87 mi) separate Sicily and Africa (the Tunisian peninsula), by the channel of Sicily.[5]\n\n\nTo the east, Salento is 70 km (43 mi) from the Albanian coast,[6] at the narrowest point of the Strait of Otranto. It is Capo d'Otranto (also called *Punta Palascìa*), located at 40° 7' north latitude and 18° 31' east longitude. To the north of Salento lies the long and narrow inlet of the Adriatic Sea.\n\n\n\n![](image)Map of the climate of Italy\nThe islands of Sardinia and Corsica then divide the Tyrrhenian Sea from the Sardinian Sea.\n\n\n\n![](image)Vetta d'Italia, until 1997 considered the northernmost point of Italy, is now located 400 m further north in the Testa Gemella Occidentale\n![](image)Punta Pesce Spada in Lampedusa, the southernmost point\n![](image)The lighthouse of Punta Palascìa, better known as Capo d'Otranto, the easternmost point of the Italian territory\n![](image)Rocca Bernauda, the westernmost point of the Italian territory\nThe coastal development of the Italian peninsula and islands is vast; about 8,000 kilometres (5,000 mi),[7][8] which is much larger than that of the Iberian peninsula, but much less than that of the Balkans.\n\n\nItaly has a prevalence of hilly areas (41.6% of the territory) compared to mountainous areas (35.2% of the territory), or flat areas (23.2%).[9]\n\n\nThe Italian soil today is the result of anthropization and is partly mountainous, partly hilly, partly volcanic, partly endolagunar with bumps, polesine, islands, dried up by reclamation (Bonifiche Circeo, Ferraresi, Comacchio, Ostiense, Pisana and so on) with ever greater raising of embankments (for example the withdrawal of 1.7 billion cubic meters per year of fresh water, from 20 consortia from Veneto alone).\n\n\nNo inhabited center in Italy is more than 294 km (183 mi) from the sea and the Italian municipality farthest from the sea is Madesimo (province of Sondrio) which is 294 km (183 mi) from the Ligurian Sea.[10]\n\n\n\n### Boundaries[edit]\n\n\nItaly borders Switzerland (698 km or 434 mi), France (476 km or 296 mi), Austria (404 km or 251 mi) and Slovenia (218 km or 135 mi). San Marino (37 km or 23 mi) and Vatican City (3.4 km or 2.1 mi) are enclaves. The total border length is 1,836.4 km (1,141.1 mi).

The Italian geographical region also includes territories that are sovereign parts of Croatia, France, Slovenia and Switzerland, as well as the four small independent states of the Principality of Monaco, the Republic of Malta, the Republic of San Marino and the Vatican City State (the Holy See).[4] Italy and the Italian geographical region are both divided into three parts, albeit with some differences.\n\n\n\n### Continental Italy[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Northern Italy\n\nContinental Italy defined as the southern side of the Alps, the Po Valley, Liguria and the portion of the Apennines bounded by the conventional line that connects La Spezia to Rimini.[16] The region of Nice (corresponding to the historic County of Nice), Italian Switzerland, part of Julian March and other less extensive portions of territory such as Valle Stretta, Gondo and Val Monastero, are not part of the Italian Republic in its continental part but they are part of the Italian geographical region. Conversely, the Val di Lei, the Val di Livigno, the San Candido basin, the Rio Sesto valley and the Tarvisio basin, although part of the Italian Republic, are not included in the Italian geographical region.\n\n\n\n### Peninsular Italy[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Central Italy, Southern Italy, and Italian peninsula\n\nBy peninsular Italy we mean the entire southern part of the aforementioned line, up to Punta Melito in Calabria (which is the southernmost point of the peninsula) and Santa Maria di Leuca in Apulia. San Marino and the Vatican City are foreign territories, although included in the Italian geographical region.\n\n\nThe Italian peninsula occupies a median position between the three main peninsulas of southern Europe, emerging right in the center of the Mediterranean Sea, with large islands and some archipelagos.\n\n\n\n### Insular Italy[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Insular Italy and List of islands of Italy\n\n![](image)Map of Italian islands.\nInsular Italy is made up of Sardinia, Sicily and numerous smaller islands, scattered or grouped into archipelagos in the seas that bathe the coasts of the peninsula. Corsica is not politically included in insular Italy since it belongs to France, however, it is included in the Italian geographical region.\n\n\nThe five largest islands belonging to the Italian state are, in order of size:\n\n\n\n* Sicily (25,707 km2 or 9,926 sq mi)\n* Sardinia (24,090 km2 or 9,300 sq mi)\n* Elba (223 km2 or 86 sq mi)\n* Sant'Antioco (108.9 km2 or 42.0 sq mi)\n* Pantelleria (83 km2 or 32 sq mi).\n\n\nOther islands belonging to Italy are grouped into the following archipelagos:\n\n\n\n* Archipelago of the Gulf of La Spezia, formed by the island of Palmaria, Tino and Tinetto;\n* Tuscan archipelago, formed by the island of Elba, the largest and most important of the group from whose bowels iron has been extracted for centuries. To the north of the island of Elba rise Capraia and Gorgona, to the south Pianosa, Montecristo, Giannutri and the island of Giglio. Minor islets are Cerboli and Palmaiola off the coast of Elba, the Islet of the Sparviero at Punta Ala, the Formiche di Grosseto, the Formica di Burano, the Formica di Montecristo (or Scoglio d'Africa) and some islets off the coast of promontory of the Argentario including Argentarola, Isola Rossa and Isolotto, in addition to the Secche della Meloria and the Secche di Vada.\n* The Phlegraean Islands (Ischia and Procida) plus Capri, in the Gulf of Naples; sometimes the three islands are included in the Campanian Archipelago;\n* Pontine islands: Ponza, Palmarola, Zannone and Ventotene, in the gulf of Gaeta;\n* Archipelago of the Aeolian Islands or Lipari, which includes Salina, Lipari, the largest of the group, Vulcano, a now almost extinct volcano; Panarea and then Stromboli, an eruptive cone still in activity which was called *Stronghilo* by the ancient Greeks (hence Stromboli), due to its conical shape of an inverted top on the sea; to these must be added Filicudi and Alicudi;\n* Aegadian Islands, i.e. the islands of Favignana, Marettimo, Levanzo and Stagnone, which arise between Marsala and Trapani, west of Sicily;\n* Pelagie Islands, including Linosa, Lampione and Lampedusa;\n* In Sicily we still find Ustica off the Gulf of Palermo and Pantelleria in the middle of the Sicilian Channel;\n* The group of the Tremiti Islands and the island of Pianosa, which rise in the Adriatic Sea;\n* To the north of Sardinia the Asinara and the archipelago of La Maddalena, to the south San Pietro and Sant'Antioco.\n* The Cheradi Islands of San Pietro and San Paolo in the Gulf of Taranto.\n\n\n## Orography[edit]\n\n\n### Mountains[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mont Blanc (Monte Bianco) in Aosta Valley, the highest point in the European Union\nAlmost 40% of the Italian territory is mountainous,[17] with the Alps as the northern boundary and the Apennine Mountains forming the backbone of the peninsula and extending for 1,350 km (840 mi).[17] The Alpine mountain range is linked with the Apennines with the Colle di Cadibona pass in the Ligurian Alps.[18] Nineteen Italian regions are crossed by either the Alps or the Apennines, or their offshoots. Sardinia has mountains with their own characteristics and are included in the Sardinian-Corsican relief, since it also affects Corsica.\n\n\nThe Alps (formed during the Mesozoic and Cenozoic)[19] surround the Po Valley to the north, east and west, and develop along the entire northern border of Italy (about 1,000 km or 620 mi), creating a natural border. The Alps contain the highest peak in the European Union, Mont Blanc, at 4,810 meters (15,780 ft) above sea level, located between the Aosta Valley and France.\n\n\nThe Apennines (formed during the Oligocene)[20] rise south of the Po Valley and run from north to south throughout the Italian peninsula, from Liguria to Calabria and continue in northern Sicily ending in the Madonie, acting as a watershed between the Tyrrhenian and Adriatic-Ionian coast.\n\n\nThe highest peaks in Italy are found in the Western Alps, where there are numerous peaks that exceed 4,000 meters (13,000 ft) including Monte Rosa (4,634 meters or 15,203 feet), the Cervino (4,478 meters or 14,692 feet) and Mont Blanc which with its 4,810 meters (15,780 ft). The maximum height of the Apennines is the Gran Sasso d'Italia (2,912 meters or 9,554 feet).\n\n\nWorldwide-known mountains in Italy are Monte Cervino (Matterhorn), Monte Rosa, Gran Paradiso in the West Alps, and Bernina, Stelvio and Dolomites along the eastern side of the Alps.\n\n\n\n### Hills[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Euganean Hills\nThe hills cover most of the Italian territory. They are mainly located in the central-southern part of the peninsula,[21] along the sides of the Apennine ridge, but also in the pre-Alpine area, close to the Alps.[21]\n\n\nThe hilly reliefs, which alternate with hollows and valleys, have slight slopes and do not exceed 800 meters or 2,600 feet.\n\n\nThe first two hilly systems are the subalpine hills and the Preappennino, two hilly strips arranged between the Alps and the Po Valley and between the Apennines and the Adriatic coast respectively.[22] The subalpine hills widen more in the western part of the Po Valley, where they form the hills of the Langhe and Montferrat.[22] Two other hill systems are the Tyrrhenian Anti-Apennine, which extends from the Colline Metallifere of Tuscany to Vesuvius and the Beneventane Hills in Campania, and the Adriatic Anti-Apennine, present in Puglia with the Murge and Gargano hills.[22]\n\n\nThe Italian hills have different origins:\n\n\n\n* The Langhe, Monferrato, Chianti and Murge are sedimentary hills[21] formed by the lifting of the seabed.\n* The Beneventane Hills are of tertiary formation, that is, composed of gravel stratifications or masses of pebbles mixed with limestone and sandstone, probably due to the raising of the lake bottom.\n* The hills of Brianza, of Canavese and more generally of the entire strip that runs at the foot of the Alps are morainic,[21] that is, made up of deposits of earth and crushed stone transported by ancient glaciers.\n* The Euganean Hills and numerous other formations in Tuscany, Lazio, Campania are of volcanic origin,[21] i.e. they are the remains of ancient extinct volcanoes, rounded by a long erosion.\n\n\n### Plains[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Plain of Campidano\nThe plains make up 23.2% of the Italian national territory. In between the two lies a large plain in the valley of the Po, the largest river in Italy, which flows 652 km (405 mi) eastward from the Cottian Alps to the Adriatic. The Po Valley is the largest plain in Italy, with 46,000 km2 (18,000 sq mi), and it represents over 70% of the total plain area in the country.[17] The Po Valley is divided into two bands:[22] the high plain, which borders the Alpine and Apennine hills, and the low plain located in the center and extended up to the Po delta.\n\n\nIn the peninsular part and in the islands there are only small plains often located along the coasts and at the mouth of the major rivers, near which they formed:[22] this is the case, for example, of the Tavoliere delle Puglie, of the Campidano in Sardinia or the Maremma in Tuscany.[22]\n\n\nThe Italian plains have different origins:\n\n\n\n* Most of it is of alluvial origin, that is, formed by the debris deposited by the rivers along their course. The Po Valley, Valdarno, Pontine Marshes, Campidano, Metapontino, Plain of Sele, Salento, Plain of Sibari, Plain of Catania and Plain of Sant'Eufemia are alluvial.[23]\n* The second largest Italian plain is the Tavoliere delle Puglie,[23] which is a rising plain, formed from the raising of the seabed.\n* Other plains, for example the Plain of Campania, are of volcanic origin[23] where the ashes of the volcanoes have filled the surrounding valleys, transforming them into fertile plains.\n\n\n## Hydrography[edit]\n\n\nItaly is surrounded, except to the north, by the sea, and its territory has a rich reserve of inland waters (rivers and lakes). The southern regions, however, are drier than the northern ones, due to the scarcity of rains and the absence of glaciers that can feed the rivers.\n\n\n\n### Rivers[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Po river in Turin\n![](image)The Tiber river in Rome\nItalian rivers are shorter than those of other European regions due to the Apennines that run along the entire length of the peninsula, dividing the waters into two opposite sides. They are numerous however, due to the relative abundance of rains in Italy in general, and to the presence of the Alpine chain, rich in snowfields and glaciers, in northern Italy.\n\n\nThe fundamental watershed follows the ridge of the Alps and the Apennines and defines five main slopes, corresponding to the seas into which the rivers flow: the Adriatic, Ionic, Tyrrhenian, Ligurian and Mediterranean sides.[24] Italian rivers are categorized into two main groups: the Alpine-Po river rivers and the Apennine-island rivers.[24]\n\n\nThe longest Italian river is the Po (652 km or 405 mi), which flows from the Monviso, runs through the entire Po Valley from west to east, and then flows, with a delta, into the Adriatic Sea. In addition to being the longest, it is also the river with the largest basin and the largest flow at its mouth. The second longest Italian river is the Adige (410 km or 250 mi), which originates near Lake Resia and flows into the Adriatic Sea, after having made a north-south route, near Chioggia. The third longest river in Italy is the Tiber (405 km or 252 mi), the second longest Italian river in terms of hydrographic basin; it was formed on Monte Fumaiolo (in Emilia-Romagna) and flows into the Tyrrhenian Sea after having crossed the center of Rome. After the Tiber, in order of length are the rivers Adda (313 km or 194 mi), Oglio (280 km or 170 mi), Tanaro (276 km or 171 mi) and Ticino (248 km (154 mi), of which 157 km (98 mi) is in Italy).\n\n\nMost of Italy's rivers drain either into the Adriatic Sea (such as Po, Piave, Adige, Brenta, Tagliamento, Reno) or into the Tyrrhenian (like Arno, Tiber and Volturno), though the waters from some border municipalities drain into the Black Sea through the basin of the Drava (Innichen and Sexten in Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol, Tarvisio in Friuli-Venezia-Giulia) or the Inn (Livigno in Lombardy), both tributaries of the Danube, and the waters from the Lago di Lei in Lombardy drain into the North Sea through the basin of Rhine.\n\n\n\n### Lakes[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lake Garda is the largest of the Italian lakes\nIn Italy there are more than 1,000 lakes, mostly artificially created by the damming of river valleys.[25]\n\n\nIn the north of the country are a number of subalpine moraine-dammed lakes (the Italian Lakes), including the largest in Italy, the Garda (370 km2 or 143 sq mi).[26] Other well known of these subalpine lakes are Lake Maggiore (212.5 km2 or 82 sq mi), whose most northerly section is part of Switzerland, Como (which holds the record of depth in the Italian Republic, which amounts to 410 m or 1,350 ft)[27] (146 km2 or 56 sq mi), Orta, Lugano, Iseo, Idro. These lakes occupy wide valleys carved by ancient glaciers.\n\n\nIn Italy there are also coastal lakes, such as Lake Lesina, separated from the sea by a narrow strip of land, and volcanic lakes (Lake Bolsena, Lake Vico, Lake Bracciano), which occupy the craters of extinct volcanoes. Lake Trasimeno, on the other hand, formed in a hollow in the territory.[26] Other notable lakes in the Italian peninsula are Varano and Omodeo in Sardinia.\n\n\nThe swamps and ponds that in the past covered vast flat areas of Italy, in recent centuries have been largely dried up;[26] the few remaining wetlands, such as the Valli di Comacchio in Emilia-Romagna or the Stagno di Cagliari in Sardinia, are protected as very precious natural environments.[26]\n\n\nAlong the Italian coasts there are lagoons, among which the Venetian Lagoon, that of Grado Lagoon and that of Marano Lagoon in the northern Adriatic stand out for their size and importance, and the Orbetello Lagoon on the Tuscan coast.\n\n\n\n### Seas and coasts[edit]\n\n\n![](image)View of the Strait of Messina\n![](image)Population density (*left*) and elevation above sea level (*right*) in Veneto (2010). Veneto is particularly vulnerable to rising sea level.\nThe Italian peninsula overlooks the Mediterranean Sea, which around it is divided into various seas.[26]\n\n\nThe Ligurian Sea bathes the coasts of Liguria and, according to the cartography of the Hydrographic Institute of the Navy, the northern Tuscan coasts to the south as far as the island of Elba.\n\n\nThe Tyrrhenian Sea bathes the western coasts of the peninsula south of the island of Elba (and therefore all the regions from Tuscany to Calabria), the northern coasts of Sicily and the eastern coasts of Sardinia.\n\n\nThe Adriatic Sea bathes the eastern coasts of the peninsula, from Friuli Venezia Giulia to the Cape of Santa Maria di Leuca, Apulia.\n\n\nThe Ionian Sea bathes the eastern coasts of Sicily and Calabria, the coast of Basilicata and the western coasts of Apulia.\n\n\nTo the south of Sicily lies the Strait of Sicily, while to the west of Sardinia lies the Sea of Sardinia.[28]\n\n\nItaly has a coastline of approximately 7,900 km (4,900 mi),[29][30] with a great variety of shapes that depends both on the nature of the mainland and on the action of the sea.\n\n\nThe Adriatic coasts are quite straight, characterized to the north by the gulfs of Trieste and Venice, in the center by the Conero promontory, to the south by that of the Gargano, which forms the Gulf of Manfredonia. The Adriatic coasts are low and sandy,[26] with lagoons in the northern section. Only in the Trieste area, in correspondence with the Gargano, the Conero and the lower eastern Salento (between Otranto and Santa Maria di Leuca) do rocky sections follow one another.\n\n\nThe Ionian coasts are mainly low and sandy and are characterized by the wide Gulf of Taranto, closed to the east by the Salento Peninsula (which divides it from the Adriatic) and to the west by the Calabrian peninsula (which divides it from the Tyrrhenian Sea).\n\n\nThe Strait of Messina connects the Ionian and the Tyrrhenian seas.\n\n\nThe Tyrrhenian coasts are very articulated, with rocky stretches alternating with sandy beaches, with numerous gulfs and headlands. Among the many gulfs include Naples, Salerno and Gaeta, between the peninsulas that of Sorrento and the promontories that of Circeo and that of Piombino. In the Tyrrhenian Sea, there are three important channels: between the island of Elba and the Tuscan coast the Strait of Piombino, between Elba and Corsica the Strait of Corsica,[26] and between Sardinia and Corsica the Strait of Bonifacio.\n\n\nThe Ligurian Sea, which has the Gulf of Genoa at its center, has high and rocky coasts in the Riviera di Levante and mixed coasts in the Riviera di Ponente.[26]\n\n\n\n## Geology[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The prefecture of L'Aquila after the earthquake of 6 April 2009\n![](image)Etna eruption in 2011\nThe underground thrusts that millions of years ago gave rise to the reliefs of Italy still continue: the earthquakes and the eruptive activity of volcanoes testify to this.\n\n\n\n### Earthquakes[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of earthquakes in Italy\n\nSqueezed between two plates, the African Plate and the Eurasian Plate, Italy is very subject to earthquakes, even intense ones, so much so that it holds the record in Europe.[31] In particular, the areas at greatest seismic risk are the north and south-west of Sicily, the whole Apennines (but in particular the central-southern area), northern Apulia, almost all of Friuli Venezia Giulia and finally the north-west of Veneto. On the contrary, the areas with little or no seismic risk are the Alps (excluding the extreme western and eastern area), most of the Po Valley, the Tyrrhenian coasts up to Lazio, central-southern Apulia, Sardinia and central Sicily.[32]\n\n\n\n### Volcanoes[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of volcanoes in Italy\n\nItaly is also known for the presence of numerous volcanoes, the most well-known being Vesuvius near Naples, Etna near Catania (which with its 3,343 m (10,968 ft) is the highest volcano in Europe),[Note 2] Stromboli and Vulcano, in the Aeolian Islands in the province of Messina, in addition to the large caldera formed by the Campi Flegrei in Campania.\n\n\nThe peninsula also has many extinct volcanoes, that is, which have ceased their eruptive activity, such as the Euganean Hills in the province of Padua, Mount Amiata in Tuscany, the Berici Hills in the province of Vicenza and the Castelli Romani area, where there are several lakes that occupy the craters of ancient volcanoes. The lakes of Bracciano, Vico and Bolsena in northern Lazio also had a similar origin.\n\n\nIn recent years, numerous studies have also been conducted to better understand the structure and destructive potential of the submarine volcano Marsili, located about 140 km (87 mi) north of Sicily and about 150 km (93 mi) west of Calabria. With its 70 km (43 mi) of length and 30 km (19 mi) of width (equal to 2,100 km2 (810 sq mi) of surface) the Marsili is one of the largest volcanoes in Europe.\n\n\nMany elements of the Italian territory are of volcanic origin. Most of the small islands and archipelagos in the south, like Capraia, Ponza, Ischia, Eolie, Ustica and Pantelleria are volcanic islands.\n\n\n\n## Gallery[edit]\n\n\n* ![Astronaut photograph highlighting the night-time appearance of southern Italy.](image)\n\nAstronaut photograph highlighting the night-time appearance of southern Italy.\n* ![Southern Italy and Sicily on the 1849 map.](image)\n\nSouthern Italy and Sicily on the 1849 map.\n* ![Etna, the highest active volcano in Europe.](image)\n\nEtna, the highest active volcano in Europe.\n* ![Asinara island with the Aragonese Torre della Pelosa (16th century), Sardinia.](image)\n\nAsinara island with the Aragonese Torre della Pelosa (16th century), Sardinia.\n* ![The coastal areas of Liguria have a Mediterranean climate.](image)\n\nThe coastal areas of Liguria have a Mediterranean climate.\n* ![Landscape of Tuscany.](image)\n\nLandscape of Tuscany.\n* ![Rice paddies in the Po Valley near Vercelli.](image)\n\nRice paddies in the Po Valley near Vercelli.\n* ![Marmore waterfall, the world's tallest man-made waterfall, was created by the ancient Romans.](image)\n\nMarmore waterfall, the world's tallest man-made waterfall, was created by the ancient Romans.\n* ![Mount Vesuvius looms over the ruins of Pompeii.](image)\n\nMount Vesuvius looms over the ruins of Pompeii.\n* ![Panorama of Venice and its lagoon.](image)\n\nPanorama of Venice and its lagoon.\n* ![The Karst Plateau drops vertically into the Adriatic Sea near Trieste.](image)\n\nThe Karst Plateau drops vertically into the Adriatic Sea near Trieste.\n* ![Gran Sasso d'Italia, the highest peak of the Apennines.](image)\n\nGran Sasso d'Italia, the highest peak of the Apennines.\n* ![Vineyards in the Montferrat hills, with the Monviso in the background.](image)\n\nVineyards in the Montferrat hills, with the Monviso in the background.\n* ![Livigno, the highest comune in Italy, during winter.](image)\n\nLivigno, the highest comune in Italy, during winter.\n* ![The Strait of Messina as seen from the mainland.](image)\n\nThe Strait of Messina as seen from the mainland.\n* ![La Canna rock off the coast of Filicudi.](image)\n\n*La Canna* rock off the coast of Filicudi.\n* ![Southern coast of Sardinia.](image)\n\nSouthern coast of Sardinia.\n* ![The Po river as seen in Cremona, on a foggy winter day.](image)\n\nThe Po river as seen in Cremona, on a foggy winter day.\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n**Map all coordinates using** OpenStreetMap\n**Download coordinates as:**\n\n\n\n* KML\n* GPX (all coordinates)\n* GPX (primary coordinates)\n* GPX (secondary coordinates)\n\n* Climate of Italy\n* Italy (geographical region)\n* List of islands of Italy\n* Natural hazards in Italy\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** 2006 estimates.\n2. **^** If the Caucasus Mountains is considered outside the natural borders of the European continent, Etna appears to be the highest volcano in Europe; including the Caucasus, Etna still remains the continent's highest active volcano.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Italia\", *Dizionario enciclopedico italiano* (in Italian), vol. VI, Treccani, 1970, p. 413\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** \"Italia\". *L'Enciclopedia Geografica* (in Italian).

Italy, whose territory largely coincides with the homonymous geographical region,[1] is located in southern Europe and comprises the long, boot-shaped Italian Peninsula crossed by the Apennines, the southern side of Alps, the large plain of the Po Valley and some islands including Sicily and Sardinia. Italy is part of the Northern Hemisphere. Two of the Pelagie Islands (Lampedusa and Lampione) are located on the African continent.\n\n\nThe total area of Italy is 301,230 km2 (116,310 sq mi), of which 294,020 km2 (113,520 sq mi) is land and 7,210 km2 (2,784 sq mi) is water. It lies between latitudes 35° and 47° N, and longitudes 6° and 19° E. Italy borders Switzerland (698 km or 434 mi), France (476 km or 296 mi), Austria (404 km or 251 mi) and Slovenia (218 km or 135 mi). San Marino (37 km or 23 mi) and Vatican City (3.4 km or 2.1 mi) are enclaves. The total border length is 1,836.4 km (1,141.1 mi). Including islands, Italy has a coastline of 7,900 km (4,900 mi) on the Adriatic Sea, Ionian Sea, Tyrrhenian Sea, Ligurian Sea, Sea of Sardinia and Strait of Sicily.\n\n\nThe Italian geographical region,[2][3] in its traditional and most widely accepted extent, has an area of approximately 324,000 square kilometres (125,000 sq mi),[2] which is greater than the area of the entire Italian Republic (301,230 square kilometres or 116,310 square miles). The Italian geographical region also includes territories that are sovereign parts of Croatia, France, Slovenia and Switzerland, as well as the four small independent states of the Principality of Monaco, the Republic of Malta, the Republic of San Marino and the Vatican City State (the Holy See).[4]\n\n\n\n\n## General features[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Satellite image of Italy.\nItaly is joined to the central-western section of the European continent by the Alps. Due to its position, it constitutes a bridge between Europe and Africa. In particular, the Italian peninsula is located in the center of the Mediterranean Sea, between the Balkans and Hellenic peninsula to the east, the Iberian peninsula to the west, North Africa to the south and continental Europe to the north separated by the Alps.\n\n\nItaly also separates the western basin of the Mediterranean Sea from the eastern basin — that is, the Tyrrhenian Sea from the Ionian Sea — extending towards the west with Calabria and Sicily, which together geologically form a peninsular extension. Only 140 km (87 mi) separate Sicily and Africa (the Tunisian peninsula), by the channel of Sicily.[5]\n\n\nTo the east, Salento is 70 km (43 mi) from the Albanian coast,[6] at the narrowest point of the Strait of Otranto. It is Capo d'Otranto (also called *Punta Palascìa*), located at 40° 7' north latitude and 18° 31' east longitude. To the north of Salento lies the long and narrow inlet of the Adriatic Sea.\n\n\n\n![](image)Map of the climate of Italy\nThe islands of Sardinia and Corsica then divide the Tyrrhenian Sea from the Sardinian Sea.\n\n\n\n![](image)Vetta d'Italia, until 1997 considered the northernmost point of Italy, is now located 400 m further north in the Testa Gemella Occidentale\n![](image)Punta Pesce Spada in Lampedusa, the southernmost point\n![](image)The lighthouse of Punta Palascìa, better known as Capo d'Otranto, the easternmost point of the Italian territory\n![](image)Rocca Bernauda, the westernmost point of the Italian territory\nThe coastal development of the Italian peninsula and islands is vast; about 8,000 kilometres (5,000 mi),[7][8] which is much larger than that of the Iberian peninsula, but much less than that of the Balkans.\n\n\nItaly has a prevalence of hilly areas (41.6% of the territory) compared to mountainous areas (35.2% of the territory), or flat areas (23.2%).[9]\n\n\nThe Italian soil today is the result of anthropization and is partly mountainous, partly hilly, partly volcanic, partly endolagunar with bumps, polesine, islands, dried up by reclamation (Bonifiche Circeo, Ferraresi, Comacchio, Ostiense, Pisana and so on) with ever greater raising of embankments (for example the withdrawal of 1.7 billion cubic meters per year of fresh water, from 20 consortia from Veneto alone).\n\n\nNo inhabited center in Italy is more than 294 km (183 mi) from the sea and the Italian municipality farthest from the sea is Madesimo (province of Sondrio) which is 294 km (183 mi) from the Ligurian Sea.[10]\n\n\n\n### Boundaries[edit]\n\n\nItaly borders Switzerland (698 km or 434 mi), France (476 km or 296 mi), Austria (404 km or 251 mi) and Slovenia (218 km or 135 mi). San Marino (37 km or 23 mi) and Vatican City (3.4 km or 2.1 mi) are enclaves. The total border length is 1,836.4 km (1,141.1 mi).

The Italian geographical region also includes territories that are sovereign parts of Croatia, France, Slovenia and Switzerland, as well as the four small independent states of the Principality of Monaco, the Republic of Malta, the Republic of San Marino and the Vatican City State (the Holy See).[4] Italy and the Italian geographical region are both divided into three parts, albeit with some differences.\n\n\n\n### Continental Italy[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Northern Italy\n\nContinental Italy defined as the southern side of the Alps, the Po Valley, Liguria and the portion of the Apennines bounded by the conventional line that connects La Spezia to Rimini.[16] The region of Nice (corresponding to the historic County of Nice), Italian Switzerland, part of Julian March and other less extensive portions of territory such as Valle Stretta, Gondo and Val Monastero, are not part of the Italian Republic in its continental part but they are part of the Italian geographical region. Conversely, the Val di Lei, the Val di Livigno, the San Candido basin, the Rio Sesto valley and the Tarvisio basin, although part of the Italian Republic, are not included in the Italian geographical region.\n\n\n\n### Peninsular Italy[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Central Italy, Southern Italy, and Italian peninsula\n\nBy peninsular Italy we mean the entire southern part of the aforementioned line, up to Punta Melito in Calabria (which is the southernmost point of the peninsula) and Santa Maria di Leuca in Apulia. San Marino and the Vatican City are foreign territories, although included in the Italian geographical region.\n\n\nThe Italian peninsula occupies a median position between the three main peninsulas of southern Europe, emerging right in the center of the Mediterranean Sea, with large islands and some archipelagos.\n\n\n\n### Insular Italy[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Insular Italy and List of islands of Italy\n\n![](image)Map of Italian islands.\nInsular Italy is made up of Sardinia, Sicily and numerous smaller islands, scattered or grouped into archipelagos in the seas that bathe the coasts of the peninsula. Corsica is not politically included in insular Italy since it belongs to France, however, it is included in the Italian geographical region.\n\n\nThe five largest islands belonging to the Italian state are, in order of size:\n\n\n\n* Sicily (25,707 km2 or 9,926 sq mi)\n* Sardinia (24,090 km2 or 9,300 sq mi)\n* Elba (223 km2 or 86 sq mi)\n* Sant'Antioco (108.9 km2 or 42.0 sq mi)\n* Pantelleria (83 km2 or 32 sq mi).\n\n\nOther islands belonging to Italy are grouped into the following archipelagos:\n\n\n\n* Archipelago of the Gulf of La Spezia, formed by the island of Palmaria, Tino and Tinetto;\n* Tuscan archipelago, formed by the island of Elba, the largest and most important of the group from whose bowels iron has been extracted for centuries. To the north of the island of Elba rise Capraia and Gorgona, to the south Pianosa, Montecristo, Giannutri and the island of Giglio. Minor islets are Cerboli and Palmaiola off the coast of Elba, the Islet of the Sparviero at Punta Ala, the Formiche di Grosseto, the Formica di Burano, the Formica di Montecristo (or Scoglio d'Africa) and some islets off the coast of promontory of the Argentario including Argentarola, Isola Rossa and Isolotto, in addition to the Secche della Meloria and the Secche di Vada.\n* The Phlegraean Islands (Ischia and Procida) plus Capri, in the Gulf of Naples; sometimes the three islands are included in the Campanian Archipelago;\n* Pontine islands: Ponza, Palmarola, Zannone and Ventotene, in the gulf of Gaeta;\n* Archipelago of the Aeolian Islands or Lipari, which includes Salina, Lipari, the largest of the group, Vulcano, a now almost extinct volcano; Panarea and then Stromboli, an eruptive cone still in activity which was called *Stronghilo* by the ancient Greeks (hence Stromboli), due to its conical shape of an inverted top on the sea; to these must be added Filicudi and Alicudi;\n* Aegadian Islands, i.e. the islands of Favignana, Marettimo, Levanzo and Stagnone, which arise between Marsala and Trapani, west of Sicily;\n* Pelagie Islands, including Linosa, Lampione and Lampedusa;\n* In Sicily we still find Ustica off the Gulf of Palermo and Pantelleria in the middle of the Sicilian Channel;\n* The group of the Tremiti Islands and the island of Pianosa, which rise in the Adriatic Sea;\n* To the north of Sardinia the Asinara and the archipelago of La Maddalena, to the south San Pietro and Sant'Antioco.\n* The Cheradi Islands of San Pietro and San Paolo in the Gulf of Taranto.\n\n\n## Orography[edit]\n\n\n### Mountains[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mont Blanc (Monte Bianco) in Aosta Valley, the highest point in the European Union\nAlmost 40% of the Italian territory is mountainous,[17] with the Alps as the northern boundary and the Apennine Mountains forming the backbone of the peninsula and extending for 1,350 km (840 mi).[17] The Alpine mountain range is linked with the Apennines with the Colle di Cadibona pass in the Ligurian Alps.[18] Nineteen Italian regions are crossed by either the Alps or the Apennines, or their offshoots. Sardinia has mountains with their own characteristics and are included in the Sardinian-Corsican relief, since it also affects Corsica.\n\n\nThe Alps (formed during the Mesozoic and Cenozoic)[19] surround the Po Valley to the north, east and west, and develop along the entire northern border of Italy (about 1,000 km or 620 mi), creating a natural border. The Alps contain the highest peak in the European Union, Mont Blanc, at 4,810 meters (15,780 ft) above sea level, located between the Aosta Valley and France.\n\n\nThe Apennines (formed during the Oligocene)[20] rise south of the Po Valley and run from north to south throughout the Italian peninsula, from Liguria to Calabria and continue in northern Sicily ending in the Madonie, acting as a watershed between the Tyrrhenian and Adriatic-Ionian coast.\n\n\nThe highest peaks in Italy are found in the Western Alps, where there are numerous peaks that exceed 4,000 meters (13,000 ft) including Monte Rosa (4,634 meters or 15,203 feet), the Cervino (4,478 meters or 14,692 feet) and Mont Blanc which with its 4,810 meters (15,780 ft). The maximum height of the Apennines is the Gran Sasso d'Italia (2,912 meters or 9,554 feet).\n\n\nWorldwide-known mountains in Italy are Monte Cervino (Matterhorn), Monte Rosa, Gran Paradiso in the West Alps, and Bernina, Stelvio and Dolomites along the eastern side of the Alps.\n\n\n\n### Hills[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Euganean Hills\nThe hills cover most of the Italian territory. They are mainly located in the central-southern part of the peninsula,[21] along the sides of the Apennine ridge, but also in the pre-Alpine area, close to the Alps.[21]\n\n\nThe hilly reliefs, which alternate with hollows and valleys, have slight slopes and do not exceed 800 meters or 2,600 feet.\n\n\nThe first two hilly systems are the subalpine hills and the Preappennino, two hilly strips arranged between the Alps and the Po Valley and between the Apennines and the Adriatic coast respectively.[22] The subalpine hills widen more in the western part of the Po Valley, where they form the hills of the Langhe and Montferrat.[22] Two other hill systems are the Tyrrhenian Anti-Apennine, which extends from the Colline Metallifere of Tuscany to Vesuvius and the Beneventane Hills in Campania, and the Adriatic Anti-Apennine, present in Puglia with the Murge and Gargano hills.[22]\n\n\nThe Italian hills have different origins:\n\n\n\n* The Langhe, Monferrato, Chianti and Murge are sedimentary hills[21] formed by the lifting of the seabed.\n* The Beneventane Hills are of tertiary formation, that is, composed of gravel stratifications or masses of pebbles mixed with limestone and sandstone, probably due to the raising of the lake bottom.\n* The hills of Brianza, of Canavese and more generally of the entire strip that runs at the foot of the Alps are morainic,[21] that is, made up of deposits of earth and crushed stone transported by ancient glaciers.\n* The Euganean Hills and numerous other formations in Tuscany, Lazio, Campania are of volcanic origin,[21] i.e. they are the remains of ancient extinct volcanoes, rounded by a long erosion.\n\n\n### Plains[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Plain of Campidano\nThe plains make up 23.2% of the Italian national territory. In between the two lies a large plain in the valley of the Po, the largest river in Italy, which flows 652 km (405 mi) eastward from the Cottian Alps to the Adriatic. The Po Valley is the largest plain in Italy, with 46,000 km2 (18,000 sq mi), and it represents over 70% of the total plain area in the country.[17] The Po Valley is divided into two bands:[22] the high plain, which borders the Alpine and Apennine hills, and the low plain located in the center and extended up to the Po delta.\n\n\nIn the peninsular part and in the islands there are only small plains often located along the coasts and at the mouth of the major rivers, near which they formed:[22] this is the case, for example, of the Tavoliere delle Puglie, of the Campidano in Sardinia or the Maremma in Tuscany.[22]\n\n\nThe Italian plains have different origins:\n\n\n\n* Most of it is of alluvial origin, that is, formed by the debris deposited by the rivers along their course. The Po Valley, Valdarno, Pontine Marshes, Campidano, Metapontino, Plain of Sele, Salento, Plain of Sibari, Plain of Catania and Plain of Sant'Eufemia are alluvial.[23]\n* The second largest Italian plain is the Tavoliere delle Puglie,[23] which is a rising plain, formed from the raising of the seabed.\n* Other plains, for example the Plain of Campania, are of volcanic origin[23] where the ashes of the volcanoes have filled the surrounding valleys, transforming them into fertile plains.\n\n\n## Hydrography[edit]\n\n\nItaly is surrounded, except to the north, by the sea, and its territory has a rich reserve of inland waters (rivers and lakes). The southern regions, however, are drier than the northern ones, due to the scarcity of rains and the absence of glaciers that can feed the rivers.\n\n\n\n### Rivers[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Po river in Turin\n![](image)The Tiber river in Rome\nItalian rivers are shorter than those of other European regions due to the Apennines that run along the entire length of the peninsula, dividing the waters into two opposite sides. They are numerous however, due to the relative abundance of rains in Italy in general, and to the presence of the Alpine chain, rich in snowfields and glaciers, in northern Italy.\n\n\nThe fundamental watershed follows the ridge of the Alps and the Apennines and defines five main slopes, corresponding to the seas into which the rivers flow: the Adriatic, Ionic, Tyrrhenian, Ligurian and Mediterranean sides.[24] Italian rivers are categorized into two main groups: the Alpine-Po river rivers and the Apennine-island rivers.[24]\n\n\nThe longest Italian river is the Po (652 km or 405 mi), which flows from the Monviso, runs through the entire Po Valley from west to east, and then flows, with a delta, into the Adriatic Sea. In addition to being the longest, it is also the river with the largest basin and the largest flow at its mouth. The second longest Italian river is the Adige (410 km or 250 mi), which originates near Lake Resia and flows into the Adriatic Sea, after having made a north-south route, near Chioggia. The third longest river in Italy is the Tiber (405 km or 252 mi), the second longest Italian river in terms of hydrographic basin; it was formed on Monte Fumaiolo (in Emilia-Romagna) and flows into the Tyrrhenian Sea after having crossed the center of Rome. After the Tiber, in order of length are the rivers Adda (313 km or 194 mi), Oglio (280 km or 170 mi), Tanaro (276 km or 171 mi) and Ticino (248 km (154 mi), of which 157 km (98 mi) is in Italy).\n\n\nMost of Italy's rivers drain either into the Adriatic Sea (such as Po, Piave, Adige, Brenta, Tagliamento, Reno) or into the Tyrrhenian (like Arno, Tiber and Volturno), though the waters from some border municipalities drain into the Black Sea through the basin of the Drava (Innichen and Sexten in Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol, Tarvisio in Friuli-Venezia-Giulia) or the Inn (Livigno in Lombardy), both tributaries of the Danube, and the waters from the Lago di Lei in Lombardy drain into the North Sea through the basin of Rhine.\n\n\n\n### Lakes[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lake Garda is the largest of the Italian lakes\nIn Italy there are more than 1,000 lakes, mostly artificially created by the damming of river valleys.[25]\n\n\nIn the north of the country are a number of subalpine moraine-dammed lakes (the Italian Lakes), including the largest in Italy, the Garda (370 km2 or 143 sq mi).[26] Other well known of these subalpine lakes are Lake Maggiore (212.5 km2 or 82 sq mi), whose most northerly section is part of Switzerland, Como (which holds the record of depth in the Italian Republic, which amounts to 410 m or 1,350 ft)[27] (146 km2 or 56 sq mi), Orta, Lugano, Iseo, Idro. These lakes occupy wide valleys carved by ancient glaciers.\n\n\nIn Italy there are also coastal lakes, such as Lake Lesina, separated from the sea by a narrow strip of land, and volcanic lakes (Lake Bolsena, Lake Vico, Lake Bracciano), which occupy the craters of extinct volcanoes. Lake Trasimeno, on the other hand, formed in a hollow in the territory.[26] Other notable lakes in the Italian peninsula are Varano and Omodeo in Sardinia.\n\n\nThe swamps and ponds that in the past covered vast flat areas of Italy, in recent centuries have been largely dried up;[26] the few remaining wetlands, such as the Valli di Comacchio in Emilia-Romagna or the Stagno di Cagliari in Sardinia, are protected as very precious natural environments.[26]\n\n\nAlong the Italian coasts there are lagoons, among which the Venetian Lagoon, that of Grado Lagoon and that of Marano Lagoon in the northern Adriatic stand out for their size and importance, and the Orbetello Lagoon on the Tuscan coast.\n\n\n\n### Seas and coasts[edit]\n\n\n![](image)View of the Strait of Messina\n![](image)Population density (*left*) and elevation above sea level (*right*) in Veneto (2010). Veneto is particularly vulnerable to rising sea level.\nThe Italian peninsula overlooks the Mediterranean Sea, which around it is divided into various seas.[26]\n\n\nThe Ligurian Sea bathes the coasts of Liguria and, according to the cartography of the Hydrographic Institute of the Navy, the northern Tuscan coasts to the south as far as the island of Elba.\n\n\nThe Tyrrhenian Sea bathes the western coasts of the peninsula south of the island of Elba (and therefore all the regions from Tuscany to Calabria), the northern coasts of Sicily and the eastern coasts of Sardinia.\n\n\nThe Adriatic Sea bathes the eastern coasts of the peninsula, from Friuli Venezia Giulia to the Cape of Santa Maria di Leuca, Apulia.\n\n\nThe Ionian Sea bathes the eastern coasts of Sicily and Calabria, the coast of Basilicata and the western coasts of Apulia.\n\n\nTo the south of Sicily lies the Strait of Sicily, while to the west of Sardinia lies the Sea of Sardinia.[28]\n\n\nItaly has a coastline of approximately 7,900 km (4,900 mi),[29][30] with a great variety of shapes that depends both on the nature of the mainland and on the action of the sea.\n\n\nThe Adriatic coasts are quite straight, characterized to the north by the gulfs of Trieste and Venice, in the center by the Conero promontory, to the south by that of the Gargano, which forms the Gulf of Manfredonia. The Adriatic coasts are low and sandy,[26] with lagoons in the northern section. Only in the Trieste area, in correspondence with the Gargano, the Conero and the lower eastern Salento (between Otranto and Santa Maria di Leuca) do rocky sections follow one another.\n\n\nThe Ionian coasts are mainly low and sandy and are characterized by the wide Gulf of Taranto, closed to the east by the Salento Peninsula (which divides it from the Adriatic) and to the west by the Calabrian peninsula (which divides it from the Tyrrhenian Sea).\n\n\nThe Strait of Messina connects the Ionian and the Tyrrhenian seas.\n\n\nThe Tyrrhenian coasts are very articulated, with rocky stretches alternating with sandy beaches, with numerous gulfs and headlands. Among the many gulfs include Naples, Salerno and Gaeta, between the peninsulas that of Sorrento and the promontories that of Circeo and that of Piombino. In the Tyrrhenian Sea, there are three important channels: between the island of Elba and the Tuscan coast the Strait of Piombino, between Elba and Corsica the Strait of Corsica,[26] and between Sardinia and Corsica the Strait of Bonifacio.\n\n\nThe Ligurian Sea, which has the Gulf of Genoa at its center, has high and rocky coasts in the Riviera di Levante and mixed coasts in the Riviera di Ponente.[26]\n\n\n\n## Geology[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The prefecture of L'Aquila after the earthquake of 6 April 2009\n![](image)Etna eruption in 2011\nThe underground thrusts that millions of years ago gave rise to the reliefs of Italy still continue: the earthquakes and the eruptive activity of volcanoes testify to this.\n\n\n\n### Earthquakes[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of earthquakes in Italy\n\nSqueezed between two plates, the African Plate and the Eurasian Plate, Italy is very subject to earthquakes, even intense ones, so much so that it holds the record in Europe.[31] In particular, the areas at greatest seismic risk are the north and south-west of Sicily, the whole Apennines (but in particular the central-southern area), northern Apulia, almost all of Friuli Venezia Giulia and finally the north-west of Veneto. On the contrary, the areas with little or no seismic risk are the Alps (excluding the extreme western and eastern area), most of the Po Valley, the Tyrrhenian coasts up to Lazio, central-southern Apulia, Sardinia and central Sicily.[32]\n\n\n\n### Volcanoes[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of volcanoes in Italy\n\nItaly is also known for the presence of numerous volcanoes, the most well-known being Vesuvius near Naples, Etna near Catania (which with its 3,343 m (10,968 ft) is the highest volcano in Europe),[Note 2] Stromboli and Vulcano, in the Aeolian Islands in the province of Messina, in addition to the large caldera formed by the Campi Flegrei in Campania.\n\n\nThe peninsula also has many extinct volcanoes, that is, which have ceased their eruptive activity, such as the Euganean Hills in the province of Padua, Mount Amiata in Tuscany, the Berici Hills in the province of Vicenza and the Castelli Romani area, where there are several lakes that occupy the craters of ancient volcanoes. The lakes of Bracciano, Vico and Bolsena in northern Lazio also had a similar origin.\n\n\nIn recent years, numerous studies have also been conducted to better understand the structure and destructive potential of the submarine volcano Marsili, located about 140 km (87 mi) north of Sicily and about 150 km (93 mi) west of Calabria. With its 70 km (43 mi) of length and 30 km (19 mi) of width (equal to 2,100 km2 (810 sq mi) of surface) the Marsili is one of the largest volcanoes in Europe.\n\n\nMany elements of the Italian territory are of volcanic origin. Most of the small islands and archipelagos in the south, like Capraia, Ponza, Ischia, Eolie, Ustica and Pantelleria are volcanic islands.\n\n\n\n## Gallery[edit]\n\n\n* ![Astronaut photograph highlighting the night-time appearance of southern Italy.](image)\n\nAstronaut photograph highlighting the night-time appearance of southern Italy.\n* ![Southern Italy and Sicily on the 1849 map.](image)\n\nSouthern Italy and Sicily on the 1849 map.\n* ![Etna, the highest active volcano in Europe.](image)\n\nEtna, the highest active volcano in Europe.\n* ![Asinara island with the Aragonese Torre della Pelosa (16th century), Sardinia.](image)\n\nAsinara island with the Aragonese Torre della Pelosa (16th century), Sardinia.\n* ![The coastal areas of Liguria have a Mediterranean climate.](image)\n\nThe coastal areas of Liguria have a Mediterranean climate.\n* ![Landscape of Tuscany.](image)\n\nLandscape of Tuscany.\n* ![Rice paddies in the Po Valley near Vercelli.](image)\n\nRice paddies in the Po Valley near Vercelli.\n* ![Marmore waterfall, the world's tallest man-made waterfall, was created by the ancient Romans.](image)\n\nMarmore waterfall, the world's tallest man-made waterfall, was created by the ancient Romans.\n* ![Mount Vesuvius looms over the ruins of Pompeii.](image)\n\nMount Vesuvius looms over the ruins of Pompeii.\n* ![Panorama of Venice and its lagoon.](image)\n\nPanorama of Venice and its lagoon.\n* ![The Karst Plateau drops vertically into the Adriatic Sea near Trieste.](image)\n\nThe Karst Plateau drops vertically into the Adriatic Sea near Trieste.\n* ![Gran Sasso d'Italia, the highest peak of the Apennines.](image)\n\nGran Sasso d'Italia, the highest peak of the Apennines.\n* ![Vineyards in the Montferrat hills, with the Monviso in the background.](image)\n\nVineyards in the Montferrat hills, with the Monviso in the background.\n* ![Livigno, the highest comune in Italy, during winter.](image)\n\nLivigno, the highest comune in Italy, during winter.\n* ![The Strait of Messina as seen from the mainland.](image)\n\nThe Strait of Messina as seen from the mainland.\n* ![La Canna rock off the coast of Filicudi.](image)\n\n*La Canna* rock off the coast of Filicudi.\n* ![Southern coast of Sardinia.](image)\n\nSouthern coast of Sardinia.\n* ![The Po river as seen in Cremona, on a foggy winter day.](image)\n\nThe Po river as seen in Cremona, on a foggy winter day.\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n**Map all coordinates using** OpenStreetMap\n**Download coordinates as:**\n\n\n\n* KML\n* GPX (all coordinates)\n* GPX (primary coordinates)\n* GPX (secondary coordinates)\n\n* Climate of Italy\n* Italy (geographical region)\n* List of islands of Italy\n* Natural hazards in Italy\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** 2006 estimates.\n2. **^** If the Caucasus Mountains is considered outside the natural borders of the European continent, Etna appears to be the highest volcano in Europe; including the Caucasus, Etna still remains the continent's highest active volcano.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Italia\", *Dizionario enciclopedico italiano* (in Italian), vol. VI, Treccani, 1970, p. 413\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** \"Italia\". *L'Enciclopedia Geografica* (in Italian).

About 80 million of the urban population is heavily concentrated on the Pacific coast of Honshu.[24]\n\n\n81% of the population lives on Honshu, 10% on Kyushu, 4.2% on Hokkaido, 3% on Shikoku, 1.1% in Okinawa Prefecture and 0.7% on other Japanese islands such as the Nanpō Islands. Nearly 1 in 3 Japanese people live in the Greater Tokyo Area, and over half live in the Kanto, Kinki, and Chukyo metropolitan areas.[115]\n\n\n\n### Honshu[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n*Okinawa Prefecture* (沖縄県) is the southernmost prefecture of Japan.[126] It encompasses two thirds of the Ryukyu Islands over 1,000 kilometres (620 mi) long. It has a population of 1,445,812 (2017) and a density of 662 persons/km2. *Okinawa Island* (沖縄本島 or 沖縄島) is the smallest and most southwestern of the five main islands, 1,206.98 km2 (466.02 sq mi).[11] It has the smallest population of 1,301,462 (2014) and the highest population density of 1083.6 persons/km2.\n\n\n\n### Nanpō Islands[edit]\n\n\n*Nanpō Islands* (南方諸島) are the groups of islands that are located to the south and east of the main islands of the Japanese archipelago. They extend from the Izu Peninsula west of Tokyo Bay southward for about 1,200 kilometres (750 mi), to within 500 kilometres (310 mi) of the Mariana Islands. The Nanpō Islands are all administered by Tokyo Metropolis.\n\n\n\n### Taiheiyō Belt[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Sea of Japan has a surface area of 978,000 km2 (378,000 sq mi), a mean depth of 1,752 m (5,748 ft) and a maximum depth of 3,742 m (12,277 ft). It has a carrot-like shape, with the major axis extending from southwest to northeast and a wide southern part narrowing toward the north. The coastal length is about 7,600 km (4,700 mi) with the largest part (3,240 km or 2,010 mi) belonging to Russia. The sea extends from north to south for more than 2,255 km (1,401 mi) and has a maximum width of about 1,070 km (660 mi).[79]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)A topographic map of Japan\nAbout 73% of Japan is mountainous,[22] with a mountain range running through each of the main islands. Japan's highest mountain is Mount Fuji, with an elevation of 3,776 m (12,388 ft). Japan's forest cover rate is 68.55% since the mountains are heavily forested. The only other developed nations with such a high forest cover percentage are Finland and Sweden.[14]\n\n\nSince there is little level ground, many hills and mountainsides at lower elevations around towns and cities are often cultivated. As Japan is situated in a volcanic zone along the Pacific deeps, frequent low-intensity earth tremors and occasional volcanic activity are felt throughout the islands. Destructive earthquakes occur several times a century. Hot springs are numerous and have been exploited by the leisure industry.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)A map of Japan\n![](image)Japanese archipelago with outlined islands\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nGeographical features of Japan\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n## External links[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Geography of Japan.\n\n* \"Colton's Japan: Nippon, Kiusiu, Sikok, Yesso and the Japanese Kuriles\" a map from 1855\n* Terrain of Japan – GJI Maps (Geospatial Information Authority of Japan)\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nJapan articles\n |\n| --- |\n| * Index\n* Outline\n |\n| History | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Regions and prefectures of Japan\nMain article: Regions of Japan\n\nJapan is informally divided into eight regions from northeast (Hokkaidō) to southwest (Ryukyu Islands):[21]\n\n\n\n* Hokkaidō\n* Tōhoku region\n* Kantō region\n* Chūbu region\n* Kansai (or Kinki) region\n* Chūgoku region\n* Shikoku\n* Kyūshū\n\n\nEach region contains several prefectures, except the Hokkaido region, which comprises only Hokkaido Prefecture.\n\n\nThe regions are not official administrative units, but have been traditionally used as the regional division of Japan in a number of contexts. For example, maps and geography textbooks divide Japan into the eight regions, weather reports usually give the weather by region, and many businesses and institutions use their home region as part of their name (Kinki Nippon Railway, Chūgoku Bank, Tohoku University, etc.). While Japan has eight High Courts, their jurisdictions do not correspond with the eight regions.\n\n\n\n## Composition, topography and geography[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n112. **^** \"歴代全国ランキング\" (in Japanese).

In 2023, a government recount of the islands with digital maps increased the total from 6,852 to 14,125 islands.[9] The five main islands are (from north to south) Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, Kyushu and Okinawa. Three of the four major islands (Honshu, Kyushu and Shikoku) are separated by narrow straits of the Seto Inland Sea and form a natural entity. The 6,847 smaller islands are called remote islands.[10][11] This includes the Bonin Islands, Daitō Islands, Minami-Tori-shima, Okinotorishima, the Ryukyu Islands, the Volcano Islands, Nansei Islands, and the Nanpō Islands, as well as numerous islets, of which 430 are inhabited. The Senkaku Islands are administered by Japan but disputed by China. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThere are plans to build underwater habitats in Japan's Exclusive Economic Zone. Currently no underwater city is constructed yet. For example, the Ocean Spiral by Shimizu Corporation would have a floating dome 500 meters in diameter with hotels, residential and commercial complexes. It could be 15 km long. This allows mining of the seabed, research and production of methane from carbon dioxide with micro-organisms. The Ocean Spiral was co-developed with JAMSTEC and Tokyo University.[132][133]\n\n\n\n## Extreme points[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Extreme points of Japan\n![](image)The summit of Mount Fuji is the highest point in Japan.\nMain article: Extreme points of Japan\n\nJapan extends from 20° to 45° north latitude (Okinotorishima to Benten-jima) and from 122° to 153° east longitude (Yonaguni to Minami Torishima).[19] These are the points that are farther north, south, east or west than any other location in Japan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Kyogashima, Kobe – first man-made island built by Taira no Kiyomori in 1173[38]\n* The Hibiya Inlet, Tokyo – first large scale reclamation project started in 1592[38]\n* Dejima, Nagasaki – built during Japan's national isolation period in 1634.

Rice has a 100% food self-sufficiency. This makes it difficult to meet Japan's food demand without imports.\n\n\n\n### Marine resources[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Japan's exclusive economic zones:Japan's EEZ\nJoint regime with Republic of Korea\nEEZ claimed by Japan, disputed by others\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Heading\n | Location\n | Prefecture | Bordering entity\n | Coordinates† | Ref\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| North (disputed)\n | Cape Kamoiwakka on Etorofu | Hokkaido‡ | Sea of Okhotsk | 45°33′26″N 148°45′09″E﻿ / ﻿45.55722°N 148.75250°E﻿ / 45.55722; 148.75250﻿ (Cape Kamoiwakka (Northernmost – disputed)) | [134] |\n| North (undisputed)\n | Benten-jima | Hokkaidō | La Pérouse Strait | 45°31′38″N 141°55′06″E﻿ / ﻿45.52722°N 141.91833°E﻿ / 45.52722; 141.91833﻿ (Bentenjima (Northernmost – undisputed)) | [135] |\n| South\n | Okinotorishima | Tokyo\n | Philippine Sea | 20°25′31″N 136°04′11″E﻿ / ﻿20.42528°N 136.06972°E﻿ / 20.42528; 136.06972﻿ (Okinotorishima (Southernmost)) |  |\n| East\n | Minami Torishima | Tokyo\n | Pacific Ocean\n | 24°16′59″N 153°59′11″E﻿ / ﻿24.28306°N 153.98639°E﻿ / 24.28306; 153.98639﻿ (Minami Torishima (Easternmost)) |  |\n| West\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nGeography of Asia\n |\n| --- |\n| Sovereign states | * Afghanistan\n* Armenia\n* Azerbaijan\n* Bahrain\n* Bangladesh\n* Bhutan\n* Brunei\n* Cambodia\n* China\n* Cyprus\n* East Timor (Timor-Leste)\n* Egypt\n* Georgia\n* India\n* Indonesia\n* Iran\n* Iraq\n* Israel\n* Japan\n* Jordan\n* Kazakhstan\n* North Korea\n* South Korea\n* Kuwait\n* Kyrgyzstan\n* Laos\n* Lebanon\n* Malaysia\n* Maldives\n* Mongolia\n* Myanmar\n* Nepal\n* Oman\n* Pakistan\n* Philippines\n* Qatar\n* Russia\n* Saudi Arabia\n* Singapore\n* Sri Lanka\n* Syria\n* Tajikistan\n* Thailand\n* Turkey\n* Turkmenistan\n* United Arab Emirates\n* Uzbekistan\n* Vietnam\n* Yemen\n |\n| States withlimited recognition | * Abkhazia\n* Northern Cyprus\n* Palestine\n* South Ossetia\n* Taiwan\n |\n| Dependencies andother territories | * British Indian Ocean Territory\n* Christmas Island\n* Cocos (Keeling) Islands\n* Hong Kong\n* Macau\n |\n| * ![](image) Category\n* ![](image) Asia portal\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nJapan's sea territory is 4,470,000 km2 (1,730,000 sq mi).[13] Japan ranks fourth with its exclusive economic zone ocean water volume from 0 to 2,000 m (6,600 ft) depth.

The relief map of the Japanese archipelago shows that 50% of Japan's sea territory has an ocean volume between 0 and 4,000 m (13,000 ft) depth. The other 50% has a depth of 4,000 m (13,000 ft) to over 6,000 m (20,000 ft). 19% has a depth of 0 to 1,000 m (3,300 ft). Thus Japan possesses one of the largest ocean territories with a combination of all depths from shallow to very deep sea.[6] Multiple long undersea mountain ranges stretch from Japan's main islands to the south. They occasionally reach above the sea surface as islands. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAround 15 million years ago, the volcanic shoreline of the Asian continent was pushed out into a series of volcanic island arcs.[16] This created the \"back-arc basins\" known as the Sea of Japan and Sea of Okhotsk with the formal shaping of the Japanese archipelago.[16] The archipelago also has summits of mountain ridges that were uplifted near the outer edge of the continental shelf.[27] About 73 percent of Japan's area is mountainous, and scattered plains and intermontane basins (in which the population is concentrated) cover only about 27 percent.[27] A long chain of mountains runs down the middle of the archipelago, dividing it into two halves, the \"face\", fronting on the Pacific Ocean, and the \"back\", toward the Sea of Japan.[27] On the Pacific side are steep mountains 1,500 to 3,000 meters high, with deep valleys and gorges.[27]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Rank\n | Name\n | Region\n | Prefecture\n | Length\n(km)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | Shinano | Hokuriku | Nagano, Niigata | 367\n |\n| 2\n | Tone | Kantō | Saitama, Chiba, Ibaraki, Tochigi, Gunma | 322\n |\n| 3\n | Ishikari | Hokkaidō | Hokkaidō | 268\n |\n| 4\n | Teshio | Hokkaidō | Hokkaidō | 256\n |\n| 5\n | Kitakami | Tōhoku | Iwate, Miyagi | 249\n |\n| 6\n | Abukuma | Tōhoku | Fukushima, Miyagi | 239\n |\n| 7\n | Mogami | Tōhoku | Yamagata | 229\n |\n| 8\n | Tenryu | Chūbu | Nagano, Aichi, Shizuoka | 212\n |\n| 9\n | Agano | Hokuriku | Niigata | 210\n |\n| 10\n | Shimanto | Shikoku | Kōchi | 196\n |\n\n\n### Lakes and coasts[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Aerial view of Lake Biwa\nMain article: List of lakes of Japan\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 20 | Nakadōri Island | 168.34 | 65.00 | Gotō Islands |\n| 21 | Hirado Island | 163.42 | 63.10 |  |\n| 22 | Miyako-jima | 158.87 | 61.34 |  |\n| 23 | Shōdoshima | 153.30 | 59.19 |  |\n| 24 | Okushiri Island | 142.97 | 55.20 |  |\n| 25 | Iki Island | 138.46 | 53.46 |  |\n| 26 | Suō-Ōshima | 128.31 | 49.54 |  |\n| 27 | Okinoerabujima | 93.63 | 36.15 |  |\n| 28 | Etajima | 91.32 | 35.26 |  |\n| 29 | Izu Ōshima | 91.06 | 35.16 | Izu Islands |\n| 30 | Nagashima Island, Kagoshima | 90.62 | 34.99 |  |\n| 31 | Rebun Island | 80 | 31 |  |\n| 32 | Kakeromajima | 77.39 | 29.88 |  |\n| 33 | Kurahashi-jima | 69.46 | 26.82 |  |\n| 34 | Shimokoshiki-jima | 66.12 | 25.53 |  |\n| 35 | Ōmishima Island, Ehime | 66.12 | 25.53 |  |\n| 36 | Hachijō-jima | 62.52 | 24.14 |  |\n| 37 | Kume Island | 59.11 | 22.82 | Okinawa Islands |\n| 38 | Kikaijima | 56.93 | 21.98 | Amami Islands |\n| 39 | Nishinoshima | 55.98 | 21.61 |  |\n| 40 | Miyake-jima | 55.44 | 21.41 |  |\n| 41 | Notojima | 46.78 | 18.06 |  |\n| 42 | Kamikoshiki-jima | 45.08 | 17.41 |  |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nJapan has a longstanding claim of the Southern Kuril Islands (Etorofu, Kunashiri, Shikotan, and the Habomai Islands). These islands were occupied by the Soviet Union in 1945.[137] The Kuril Islands historically belong to Japan.[138] The Kuril Islands were first inhabited by the Ainu people and then controlled by the Japanese Matsumae clan in the Edo Period.[139] The Soviet Union did not sign the San Francisco Treaty in 1951. The U.S. Senate Resolution of April 28, 1952, ratifying of the San Francisco Treaty, explicitly stated that the USSR had no title to the Kurils.[140] This dispute has prevented the signing of a peace treaty between Japan and Russia.\n\n\nGeographically the Kuril Islands are a northeastern extension of Hokkaido.

The parts of islands facing the Pacific Plate are typically younger and display a larger proportion of volcanic products, while island parts facing the Sea of Japan are mostly heavily faulted and folded sedimentary deposits. In northwest Japan are thick quaternary deposits. This makes determination of the geological history and composition difficult and it is not yet fully understood.[62]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n34. **^** Kawanabe, H.; Nishino, M.; and Maehata, M., editors (2012). *Lake Biwa: Interactions between Nature and People.* pp 119-120.

Lake Biwa was created by plate tectonics in an active rift zone. This created a very deep lake with a maximum depth of 104 m (341 ft). Thus it has not naturally filled with sediment. Over the course of millions of years, a diverse ecosystem evolved in the lake. It has more than 1,000 species and subspecies. There are 46 native fish species and subspecies,[34] including 11 species and 5 subspecies that are endemic or near-endemic.[32] Approximately 5,000 water birds visit the lake each year.\n\n\nThe following are the 10 largest lakes of Japan.[35]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nEast of the undersea mountain ranges are three oceanic trenches: the Kuril–Kamchatka Trench (max depth 10,542 m (34,587 ft)), Japan Trench (max depth 10,375 m (34,039 ft)) and Izu–Ogasawara Trench (max depth 9,810 m (32,190 ft)).\n\n\nThere are large quantities of marine life and mineral resources in the ocean and seabed of Japan. At a depth of over 1,000 m (3,300 ft) there are minerals such as manganese nodules, cobalt in the crust and hydrothermal deposits.\n\n\n\n## Geology[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The islands comprising the Japanese Archipelago were separated from the Asian continent by back-arc spreading.\n![](image)Tectonic map of Japan (French)\nMain article: Geology of Japan\n\n### Tectonic plates[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nJapan is generally a rainy country with high humidity.[27] Because of its wide range of latitude,[27] seasonal winds and different types of ocean currents,[*citation needed*] Japan has a variety of climates, with a latitude range of the inhabited islands from 24°N – 46°N, which is comparable to the range between Nova Scotia and The Bahamas in the east coast of North America.[27] Tokyo is between 35°N – 36°N, which is comparable to that of Tehran, Athens, or Las Vegas.[27]\n\n\nAs Mount Fuji and the coastal Japanese Alps provide a rain shadow, Nagano and Yamanashi Prefectures receive the least precipitation in Honshu, though it still exceeds 900 millimetres (35 in) annually. A similar effect is found in Hokkaido, where Okhotsk Subprefecture receives as little as 750 millimetres (30 in) per year. All other prefectures have coasts on the Pacific Ocean, Sea of Japan, Seto Inland Sea or have a body of salt water connected to them. Two prefectures—Hokkaido and Okinawa—are composed entirely of islands.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* The Kuril–Kamchatka Trench is in the northwest Pacific Ocean. It lies off the southeast coast of Kamchatka and parallels the Kuril Island chain to meet the Japan Trench east of Hokkaido.[57]\n* The Japan Trench extends 8,000 km (4,971 mi) from the Kuril Islands to the northern end of the Izu Islands. Its deepest part is 8,046 m (26,398 ft).[58] The Japan Trench is created as the oceanic Pacific Plate subducts beneath the continental Okhotsk Plate. The subduction process causes bending of the down going plate, creating a deep trench. Continuous movement on the subduction zone associated with the Japan Trench is one of the main causes of tsunamis and earthquakes in northern Japan, including the megathrust 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. The rate of subduction associated with the Japan Trench has been recorded at about 7.9–9.2 cm (3.1–3.6 in)/yr.[17]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Kabira Bay on Ishigaki Island, Okinawa Prefecture in March\n![](image)Sakura blossoms with Himeji Castle in Hyōgo Prefecture in April\n![](image)Mount Yari, Nagano Prefecture in August\nJapan's varied geographical features divide it into six principal climatic zones.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n7. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"World review of fisheries and aquaculture\". *Food and Agriculture Organization*.

The Yamato Basin and Tsushima Basin have thick ocean crusts.[79] The continental shelves of the sea are wide on the eastern shores along Japan. On the western shores, they are narrow particularly along the Korean and Russian coast, averaging about 30 km (19 mi).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Japanese archipelago is relatively far away from the Asian continent. Kyushu is closest to the southernmost point of the Korean peninsula with a distance of 190 km (120 mi), which is almost 6 times farther away than from England to France across the English Channel. Thus historically Kyushu was the gateway between Asia and Japan. China is separated by 800 km (500 mi) of sea from Japan's big main islands. Hokkaido is near Sakhalin, which was occupied by Japan from 1905 to 1945. Most of the population lives on the Pacific coast side of Honshū. The west coast facing the Sea of Japan is less densely populated.[24]\n\n\nThe Japanese archipelago was difficult to reach since before ancient history. During the Paleolithic period around 20,000 BCE at the height of the Last Glacial Maximum, there was a land bridge between Hokkaido and Sakhalin which linked Japan with the Asian continent. The land bridge disappeared when the sea levels rose in the Jōmon period around 10,000 BCE.[25]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n27. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** ***k*** ***l*** ***m*** ***n*** ***o*** ***p*** ***q*** ***r*** ***s*** ***t*** ***u*** ***v*** ***w*** ***x*** ***y*** ***z*** ***aa*** ***ab*** ***ac*** ***ad*** ***ae*** ***af*** ***ag*** ***ah*** ***ai*** ***aj*** ![Public Domain](image) This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain: Dolan, Ronald E., ed.

The Japan Trench is created as the oceanic Pacific Plate subducts beneath the continental Okhotsk Plate.[17] The continuous subduction process causes frequent earthquakes, tsunami and stratovolcanoes.[18] The islands are also affected by typhoons. The subduction plates have pulled the Japanese archipelago eastward, created the Sea of Japan and separated it from the Asian continent by back-arc spreading 15 million years ago.[16]\n\n\nThe climate varies from humid continental in the north to humid subtropical and tropical rainforest in the south.

About 80 million of the urban population is heavily concentrated on the Pacific coast of Honshu.[24]\n\n\n81% of the population lives on Honshu, 10% on Kyushu, 4.2% on Hokkaido, 3% on Shikoku, 1.1% in Okinawa Prefecture and 0.7% on other Japanese islands such as the Nanpō Islands.

It has a carrot-like shape, with the major axis extending from southwest to northeast and a wide southern part narrowing toward the north. The coastal length is about 7,600 km (4,700 mi) with the largest part (3,240 km or 2,010 mi) belonging to Russia. The sea extends from north to south for more than 2,255 km (1,401 mi) and has a maximum width of about 1,070 km (660 mi).[79]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)A topographic map of Japan\nAbout 73% of Japan is mountainous,[22] with a mountain range running through each of the main islands. Japan's highest mountain is Mount Fuji, with an elevation of 3,776 m (12,388 ft). Japan's forest cover rate is 68.55% since the mountains are heavily forested. The only other developed nations with such a high forest cover percentage are Finland and Sweden.[14]\n\n\nSince there is little level ground, many hills and mountainsides at lower elevations around towns and cities are often cultivated. As Japan is situated in a volcanic zone along the Pacific deeps, frequent low-intensity earth tremors and occasional volcanic activity are felt throughout the islands. Destructive earthquakes occur several times a century.

In 2023, a government recount of the islands with digital maps increased the total from 6,852 to 14,125 islands.[9] The five main islands are (from north to south) Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, Kyushu and Okinawa. Three of the four major islands (Honshu, Kyushu and Shikoku) are separated by narrow straits of the Seto Inland Sea and form a natural entity. The 6,847 smaller islands are called remote islands.[10][11] This includes the Bonin Islands, Daitō Islands, Minami-Tori-shima, Okinotorishima, the Ryukyu Islands, the Volcano Islands, Nansei Islands, and the Nanpō Islands, as well as numerous islets, of which 430 are inhabited.

Rice has a 100% food self-sufficiency. This makes it difficult to meet Japan's food demand without imports.\n\n\n\n### Marine resources[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Japan's exclusive economic zones:Japan's EEZ\nJoint regime with Republic of Korea\nEEZ claimed by Japan, disputed by others\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Heading\n | Location\n | Prefecture | Bordering entity\n | Coordinates† | Ref\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| North (disputed)\n | Cape Kamoiwakka on Etorofu | Hokkaido‡ | Sea of Okhotsk | 45°33′26″N 148°45′09″E﻿ / ﻿45.55722°N 148.75250°E﻿ / 45.55722; 148.75250﻿ (Cape Kamoiwakka (Northernmost – disputed)) | [134] |\n| North (undisputed)\n | Benten-jima | Hokkaidō | La Pérouse Strait | 45°31′38″N 141°55′06″E﻿ / ﻿45.52722°N 141.91833°E﻿ / 45.52722; 141.91833﻿ (Bentenjima (Northernmost – undisputed)) | [135] |\n| South\n | Okinotorishima | Tokyo\n | Philippine Sea | 20°25′31″N 136°04′11″E﻿ / ﻿20.42528°N 136.06972°E﻿ / 20.42528; 136.06972﻿ (Okinotorishima (Southernmost)) |  |\n| East\n | Minami Torishima | Tokyo\n | Pacific Ocean\n | 24°16′59″N 153°59′11″E﻿ / ﻿24.28306°N 153.98639°E﻿ / 24.28306; 153.98639﻿ (Minami Torishima (Easternmost)) |  |\n| West\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nGeography of Asia\n |\n| --- |\n| Sovereign states | * Afghanistan\n* Armenia\n* Azerbaijan\n* Bahrain\n* Bangladesh\n* Bhutan\n* Brunei\n* Cambodia\n* China\n* Cyprus\n* East Timor (Timor-Leste)\n* Egypt\n* Georgia\n* India\n* Indonesia\n* Iran\n* Iraq\n* Israel\n* Japan\n* Jordan\n* Kazakhstan\n* North Korea\n* South Korea\n* Kuwait\n* Kyrgyzstan\n* Laos\n* Lebanon\n* Malaysia\n* Maldives\n* Mongolia\n* Myanmar\n* Nepal\n* Oman\n* Pakistan\n* Philippines\n* Qatar\n* Russia\n* Saudi Arabia\n* Singapore\n* Sri Lanka\n* Syria\n* Tajikistan\n* Thailand\n* Turkey\n* Turkmenistan\n* United Arab Emirates\n* Uzbekistan\n* Vietnam\n* Yemen\n |\n| States withlimited recognition | * Abkhazia\n* Northern Cyprus\n* Palestine\n* South Ossetia\n* Taiwan\n |\n| Dependencies andother territories | * British Indian Ocean Territory\n* Christmas Island\n* Cocos (Keeling) Islands\n* Hong Kong\n* Macau\n |\n| * ![](image) Category\n* ![](image) Asia portal\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nJapan's sea territory is 4,470,000 km2 (1,730,000 sq mi).[13] Japan ranks fourth with its exclusive economic zone ocean water volume from 0 to 2,000 m (6,600 ft) depth. Japan ranks fifth with sea volume of 2,000–3,000 meters, fourth with 3,000–4,000 meters, third with 4,000–5,000 meters and first with volume of 5,000 to over 6,000 meters. The relief map of the Japanese archipelago shows that 50% of Japan's sea territory has an ocean volume between 0 and 4,000 m (13,000 ft) depth. The other 50% has a depth of 4,000 m (13,000 ft) to over 6,000 m (20,000 ft). 19% has a depth of 0 to 1,000 m (3,300 ft). Thus Japan possesses one of the largest ocean territories with a combination of all depths from shallow to very deep sea.[6] Multiple long undersea mountain ranges stretch from Japan's main islands to the south. They occasionally reach above the sea surface as islands. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAround 15 million years ago, the volcanic shoreline of the Asian continent was pushed out into a series of volcanic island arcs.[16] This created the \"back-arc basins\" known as the Sea of Japan and Sea of Okhotsk with the formal shaping of the Japanese archipelago.[16] The archipelago also has summits of mountain ridges that were uplifted near the outer edge of the continental shelf.[27] About 73 percent of Japan's area is mountainous, and scattered plains and intermontane basins (in which the population is concentrated) cover only about 27 percent.[27] A long chain of mountains runs down the middle of the archipelago, dividing it into two halves, the \"face\", fronting on the Pacific Ocean, and the \"back\", toward the Sea of Japan.[27] On the Pacific side are steep mountains 1,500 to 3,000 meters high, with deep valleys and gorges.[27]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Rank\n | Name\n | Region\n | Prefecture\n | Length\n(km)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | Shinano | Hokuriku | Nagano, Niigata | 367\n |\n| 2\n | Tone | Kantō | Saitama, Chiba, Ibaraki, Tochigi, Gunma | 322\n |\n| 3\n | Ishikari | Hokkaidō | Hokkaidō | 268\n |\n| 4\n | Teshio | Hokkaidō | Hokkaidō | 256\n |\n| 5\n | Kitakami | Tōhoku | Iwate, Miyagi | 249\n |\n| 6\n | Abukuma | Tōhoku | Fukushima, Miyagi | 239\n |\n| 7\n | Mogami | Tōhoku | Yamagata | 229\n |\n| 8\n | Tenryu | Chūbu | Nagano, Aichi, Shizuoka | 212\n |\n| 9\n | Agano | Hokuriku | Niigata | 210\n |\n| 10\n | Shimanto | Shikoku | Kōchi | 196\n |\n\n\n### Lakes and coasts[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Aerial view of Lake Biwa\nMain article: List of lakes of Japan\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 20 | Nakadōri Island | 168.34 | 65.00 | Gotō Islands |\n| 21 | Hirado Island | 163.42 | 63.10 |  |\n| 22 | Miyako-jima | 158.87 | 61.34 |  |\n| 23 | Shōdoshima | 153.30 | 59.19 |  |\n| 24 | Okushiri Island | 142.97 | 55.20 |  |\n| 25 | Iki Island | 138.46 | 53.46 |  |\n| 26 | Suō-Ōshima | 128.31 | 49.54 |  |\n| 27 | Okinoerabujima | 93.63 | 36.15 |  |\n| 28 | Etajima | 91.32 | 35.26 |  |\n| 29 | Izu Ōshima | 91.06 | 35.16 | Izu Islands |\n| 30 | Nagashima Island, Kagoshima | 90.62 | 34.99 |  |\n| 31 | Rebun Island | 80 | 31 |  |\n| 32 | Kakeromajima | 77.39 | 29.88 |  |\n| 33 | Kurahashi-jima | 69.46 | 26.82 |  |\n| 34 | Shimokoshiki-jima | 66.12 | 25.53 |  |\n| 35 | Ōmishima Island, Ehime | 66.12 | 25.53 |  |\n| 36 | Hachijō-jima | 62.52 | 24.14 |  |\n| 37 | Kume Island | 59.11 | 22.82 | Okinawa Islands |\n| 38 | Kikaijima | 56.93 | 21.98 | Amami Islands |\n| 39 | Nishinoshima | 55.98 | 21.61 |  |\n| 40 | Miyake-jima | 55.44 | 21.41 |  |\n| 41 | Notojima | 46.78 | 18.06 |  |\n| 42 | Kamikoshiki-jima | 45.08 | 17.41 |  |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nJapan has a longstanding claim of the Southern Kuril Islands (Etorofu, Kunashiri, Shikotan, and the Habomai Islands).

The U.S. Senate Resolution of April 28, 1952, ratifying of the San Francisco Treaty, explicitly stated that the USSR had no title to the Kurils.[140] This dispute has prevented the signing of a peace treaty between Japan and Russia.\n\n\nGeographically the Kuril Islands are a northeastern extension of Hokkaido.

Lake Biwa was created by plate tectonics in an active rift zone. This created a very deep lake with a maximum depth of 104 m (341 ft). Thus it has not naturally filled with sediment. Over the course of millions of years, a diverse ecosystem evolved in the lake. It has more than 1,000 species and subspecies. There are 46 native fish species and subspecies,[34] including 11 species and 5 subspecies that are endemic or near-endemic.[32] Approximately 5,000 water birds visit the lake each year.\n\n\nThe following are the 10 largest lakes of Japan.[35]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nEast of the undersea mountain ranges are three oceanic trenches: the Kuril–Kamchatka Trench (max depth 10,542 m (34,587 ft)), Japan Trench (max depth 10,375 m (34,039 ft)) and Izu–Ogasawara Trench (max depth 9,810 m (32,190 ft)).\n\n\nThere are large quantities of marine life and mineral resources in the ocean and seabed of Japan. At a depth of over 1,000 m (3,300 ft) there are minerals such as manganese nodules, cobalt in the crust and hydrothermal deposits.\n\n\n\n## Geology[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The islands comprising the Japanese Archipelago were separated from the Asian continent by back-arc spreading.\n![](image)Tectonic map of Japan (French)\nMain article: Geology of Japan\n\n### Tectonic plates[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nJapan is generally a rainy country with high humidity.[27] Because of its wide range of latitude,[27] seasonal winds and different types of ocean currents,[*citation needed*] Japan has a variety of climates, with a latitude range of the inhabited islands from 24°N – 46°N, which is comparable to the range between Nova Scotia and The Bahamas in the east coast of North America.[27] Tokyo is between 35°N – 36°N, which is comparable to that of Tehran, Athens, or Las Vegas.[27]\n\n\nAs Mount Fuji and the coastal Japanese Alps provide a rain shadow, Nagano and Yamanashi Prefectures receive the least precipitation in Honshu, though it still exceeds 900 millimetres (35 in) annually. A similar effect is found in Hokkaido, where Okhotsk Subprefecture receives as little as 750 millimetres (30 in) per year. All other prefectures have coasts on the Pacific Ocean, Sea of Japan, Seto Inland Sea or have a body of salt water connected to them. Two prefectures—Hokkaido and Okinawa—are composed entirely of islands.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* The Kuril–Kamchatka Trench is in the northwest Pacific Ocean. It lies off the southeast coast of Kamchatka and parallels the Kuril Island chain to meet the Japan Trench east of Hokkaido.[57]\n* The Japan Trench extends 8,000 km (4,971 mi) from the Kuril Islands to the northern end of the Izu Islands. Its deepest part is 8,046 m (26,398 ft).[58] The Japan Trench is created as the oceanic Pacific Plate subducts beneath the continental Okhotsk Plate. The subduction process causes bending of the down going plate, creating a deep trench. Continuous movement on the subduction zone associated with the Japan Trench is one of the main causes of tsunamis and earthquakes in northern Japan, including the megathrust 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. The rate of subduction associated with the Japan Trench has been recorded at about 7.9–9.2 cm (3.1–3.6 in)/yr.[17]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Kabira Bay on Ishigaki Island, Okinawa Prefecture in March\n![](image)Sakura blossoms with Himeji Castle in Hyōgo Prefecture in April\n![](image)Mount Yari, Nagano Prefecture in August\nJapan's varied geographical features divide it into six principal climatic zones.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n7. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"World review of fisheries and aquaculture\". *Food and Agriculture Organization*.

The Yamato Basin and Tsushima Basin have thick ocean crusts.[79] The continental shelves of the sea are wide on the eastern shores along Japan. On the western shores, they are narrow particularly along the Korean and Russian coast, averaging about 30 km (19 mi).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Japanese archipelago is relatively far away from the Asian continent. Kyushu is closest to the southernmost point of the Korean peninsula with a distance of 190 km (120 mi), which is almost 6 times farther away than from England to France across the English Channel. Thus historically Kyushu was the gateway between Asia and Japan. China is separated by 800 km (500 mi) of sea from Japan's big main islands. Hokkaido is near Sakhalin, which was occupied by Japan from 1905 to 1945. Most of the population lives on the Pacific coast side of Honshū. The west coast facing the Sea of Japan is less densely populated.[24]\n\n\nThe Japanese archipelago was difficult to reach since before ancient history. During the Paleolithic period around 20,000 BCE at the height of the Last Glacial Maximum, there was a land bridge between Hokkaido and Sakhalin which linked Japan with the Asian continent. The land bridge disappeared when the sea levels rose in the Jōmon period around 10,000 BCE.[25]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n27. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** ***k*** ***l*** ***m*** ***n*** ***o*** ***p*** ***q*** ***r*** ***s*** ***t*** ***u*** ***v*** ***w*** ***x*** ***y*** ***z*** ***aa*** ***ab*** ***ac*** ***ad*** ***ae*** ***af*** ***ag*** ***ah*** ***ai*** ***aj*** ![Public Domain](image) This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain: Dolan, Ronald E., ed.

The Japan Trench is created as the oceanic Pacific Plate subducts beneath the continental Okhotsk Plate.[17] The continuous subduction process causes frequent earthquakes, tsunami and stratovolcanoes.[18] The islands are also affected by typhoons. The subduction plates have pulled the Japanese archipelago eastward, created the Sea of Japan and separated it from the Asian continent by back-arc spreading 15 million years ago.[16]\n\n\nThe climate varies from humid continental in the north to humid subtropical and tropical rainforest in the south. These differences in climate and landscape have allowed the development of a diverse flora and fauna, with some rare endemic species, especially in the Ogasawara Islands.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 6 | Kussharo | Hokkaidō | Kushiro | Teshikaga | Acidotrophic crater lake | Fresh | 79.3 | 117.5 | 121 | 2.25\n |\n| 7 | Shinji | San'in | Shimane | Matsue, Izumo, Hikawa | Brackish | Brackish | 79.1 | 6.0 | 0 | 0.34\n |\n| 8 | Shikotsu | Hokkaidō | Ishikari | Chitose | Crater lake | Fresh | 78.4 | 360.1 | 247 | 20.9\n |\n| 9 | Tōya | Hokkaidō | Iburi | Tōyako, Sōbetsu | Oligotrophic crater lake | Fresh | 70.7 | 179.9 | 84 | 8.19\n |\n| 10 | Hamana | Tōkai | Shizuoka | Hamamatsu, Kosai, Arai | Brackish lagoon | Brackish | 65.0 | 13.1 | 0 | 0.35\n |\n\n\n![](image)Seto Inland Sea\nExtensive coastal shipping, especially around the Seto Inland Sea, compensates for the lack of navigable rivers.[27] The Pacific coastline south of Tokyo is characterized by long, narrow, gradually shallowing inlets produced by sedimentation, which has created many natural harbors.[27] The Pacific coastline north of Tokyo, the coast of Hokkaidō, and the Sea of Japan coast are generally unindented, with few natural harbors.[27]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nJapan has the third largest geothermal reserves in the world.

The Royal Observatory, Greenwich, in south-east London, is the defining point of the Prime Meridian.\n\n\nThe UK lies between the North Atlantic and the North Sea, and comes within 35 km (22 mi) of the north-west coast of France, from which it is separated by the English Channel. It shares a 499 km (310 mi) international land boundary with the Republic of Ireland.[3][4] The Channel Tunnel bored beneath the English Channel now links the UK with France.\n\n\nThe British Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies are covered in their own respective articles, see below.\n\n\n\n\n## Area[edit]\n\n\nThe total area of the United Kingdom according to the Office for National Statistics is 248,532 square kilometres (95,960 sq mi), comprising the island of Great Britain, the northeastern one-sixth of the island of Ireland (Northern Ireland) and many smaller islands.

The UK is the world's 80th largest country by land area and the 10th largest in Europe (if European Russia is included).\n\n\n\n## Physical geography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)UK's topography\n![](image)As this geological map of Great Britain demonstrates, the geology of the UK is varied and complex.\nThe physical geography of the UK varies greatly. England consists of mostly lowland terrain, with upland or mountainous terrain only found north-west of the Tees–Exe line. The upland areas include the Lake District, the Pennines, North York Moors, Exmoor and Dartmoor. The lowland areas are typically traversed by ranges of low hills, frequently composed of chalk, and flat plains. Scotland is the most mountainous country in the UK and its physical geography is distinguished by the Highland Boundary Fault which traverses the Scottish mainland from Helensburgh to Stonehaven. The faultline separates the two distinctively different regions of the Highlands to the north and west, and the Lowlands to the south and east. The Highlands are predominantly mountainous, containing the majority of Scotland's mountainous landscape, while the Lowlands contain flatter land, especially across the Central Lowlands, with upland and mountainous terrain located at the Southern Uplands. Wales is mostly mountainous, though south Wales is less mountainous than north and mid Wales. Northern Ireland consists of mostly hilly landscape and its geography includes the Mourne Mountains as well as Lough Neagh, at 388 square kilometres (150 sq mi), the largest body of water in the UK.[12]\n\n\nThe overall geomorphology of the UK was shaped by a combination of forces including tectonics and climate change, in particular glaciation in northern and western areas.\n\n\nThe tallest mountain in the UK (and British Isles) is Ben Nevis, in the Grampian Mountains, Scotland. The longest river is the River Severn which flows from Wales into England. The largest lake by surface area is Lough Neagh in Northern Ireland, though Scotland's Loch Ness has the largest volume.\n\n\n\n### Geology[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Geology of Great Britain and Geology of Ireland\n\nThe geology of the UK is complex and diverse, a result of it being subject to a variety of plate tectonic processes over a very extended period of time. Changing latitude and sea levels have been important factors in the nature of sedimentary sequences, whilst successive continental collisions have affected its geological structure with major faulting and folding being a legacy of each orogeny (mountain-building period), often associated with volcanic activity and the metamorphism of existing rock sequences. As a result of this eventful geological history, the UK shows a rich variety of landscapes.[13]\n\n\n\n#### Precambrian[edit]\n\n\nThe oldest rocks in the British Isles are the Lewisian gneisses, metamorphic rocks found in the far north-west of Scotland and in the Hebrides (with a few small outcrops elsewhere), which date from at least 2,700 Ma (Ma = million years ago). South and east of the gneisses are a complex mixture of rocks forming the North West Highlands and Grampian Highlands in Scotland. These are essentially the remains of folded sedimentary rocks that were deposited between 1,000 Ma and 670 Ma over the gneiss on what was then the floor of the Iapetus Ocean.\n\n\n\n#### Palaeozoic[edit]\n\n\nAt 520 Ma, what is now Great Britain was split between two continents; the north of Scotland was located on the continent of Laurentia at about 20° south of the equator, while the rest of the country was on the continent of Gondwana near the Antarctic Circle. In Gondwana, England and Wales were largely submerged under a shallow sea studded with volcanic islands. The remains of these islands underlie much of central England with small outcrops visible in many places.\n\n\nAbout 500 Ma southern Britain, the east coast of North America and south-east Newfoundland broke away from Gondwana to form the continent of Avalonia, which by 440 Ma had drifted to about 30° south. During this period north Wales was subject to volcanic activity. The remains of these volcanoes are still visible, one example of which is Rhobell Fawr dating from 510 Ma. Large quantities of volcanic lava and ash known as the Borrowdale Volcanics covered the Lake District and this can still be seen in the form of mountains such as Helvellyn and Scafell Pike.\n\n\nBetween 425 and 400 Ma Avalonia had joined with the continent of Baltica, and the combined landmass collided with Laurentia at about 20° south, joining the southern and northern halves of Great Britain together. The resulting Caledonian Orogeny produced an Alpine-style mountain range in much of north and west Britain.\n\n\nThe collision between continents continued during the Devonian period, producing uplift and subsequent erosion, resulting in the deposition of numerous sedimentary rock layers in lowlands and seas. The Old Red Sandstone and the contemporary volcanics and marine sediments found in Devon originated from these processes.\n\n\nAround 360 Ma Great Britain was lying at the equator, covered by the warm shallow waters of the Rheic Ocean, during which time the Carboniferous Limestone was deposited, as found in the Mendip Hills and the Peak District of Derbyshire. Later, river deltas formed and the sediments deposited were colonised by swamps and rain forest. It was in this environment that the Coal Measures were formed, the source of the majority of Britain's extensive coal reserves.\n\n\nAround 280 Ma the Variscan orogeny mountain-building period occurred, again due to collision of continental plates, causing major deformation in south-west England. The general region of Variscan folding was south of an east–west line roughly from south Pembrokeshire to Kent. Towards the end of this period granite was formed beneath the overlying rocks of Devon and Cornwall, now exposed at Dartmoor and Bodmin Moor.\n\n\nBy the end of the Carboniferous period the various continents of the Earth had fused to form the super-continent of Pangaea. Britain was located in the interior of Pangea where it was subject to a hot arid desert climate with frequent flash floods leaving deposits that formed beds of red sedimentary rock.\n\n\n\n#### Mesozoic[edit]\n\n\nAs Pangaea drifted during the Triassic, Great Britain moved away from the equator until it was between 20° and 30° north. The remnants of the Variscan uplands in France to the south were eroded down, resulting in layers of the New Red Sandstone being deposited across central England.\n\n\nPangaea began to break up at the start of the Jurassic period. Sea levels rose and Britain drifted on the Eurasian Plate to between 31° and 40° north. Much of Britain was under water again, and sedimentary rocks were deposited and can now be found underlying much of England from the Cleveland Hills of Yorkshire to the Jurassic Coast in Dorset. These include sandstones, greensands, oolitic limestone of the Cotswold Hills, corallian limestone of the Vale of White Horse and the Isle of Portland. The burial of algae and bacteria below the mud of the seafloor during this time resulted in the formation of North Sea oil and natural gas.\n\n\n\n![](image)1815 geological by William Smith\nThe modern continents having formed, the Cretaceous saw the formation of the Atlantic Ocean, gradually separating northern Scotland from North America. The land underwent a series of uplifts to form a fertile plain. After 20 million years or so, the seas started to flood the land again until much of Britain was again below the sea, though sea levels frequently changed. Chalk and flints were deposited over much of Great Britain, now notably exposed at the White Cliffs of Dover and the Seven Sisters, and also forming Salisbury Plain.\n\n\n\n#### Cenozoic[edit]\n\n\nBetween 63 and 52 Ma, the last volcanic rocks in Great Britain were formed. The major eruptions at this time produced the Antrim Plateau, the basaltic columns of the Giant's Causeway and Lundy Island in the Bristol Channel.\n\n\nThe Alpine Orogeny that took place in Europe about 50 Ma, was responsible for the folding of strata in southern England, producing the London Basin syncline, the Weald-Artois Anticline to the south, the North Downs, South Downs and Chiltern Hills.\n\n\nDuring the period the North Sea formed, Britain was uplifted. Some of this uplift was along old lines of weakness left from the Caledonian and Variscan Orogenies long before. The uplifted areas were then eroded, and further sediments, such as the London Clay, were deposited over southern England.\n\n\nThe major changes during the last 2 million years were brought about by several recent ice ages. The most severe was the Anglian Glaciation, with ice up to 1,000 m (3,300 ft) thick that reached as far south as London and Bristol. This took place between about 478,000 to 424,000 years ago, and was responsible for the diversion of the River Thames onto its present course. During the most recent Devensian glaciation, which ended a mere 10,000 years ago, the icesheet reached south to Wolverhampton and Cardiff. Among the features left behind by the ice are the fjords of the west coast of Scotland, the U-shaped valleys of the Lake District and erratics (blocks of rock) that have been transported from the Oslo region of Norway and deposited on the coast of Yorkshire.\n\n\nAmongst the most significant geological features created during the last twelve thousand years are the peat deposits of Scotland, and of coastal and upland areas of England and Wales.\n\n\nAt the present time Scotland is continuing to rise as a result of the weight of Devensian ice being lifted. Southern and eastern England is sinking, generally estimated at 1 mm (1⁄25 in) per year, with the London area sinking at double the speed partly due to the continuing compaction of the recent clay deposits.\n\n\n\n### Mountains and hills[edit]\n\n\n![](image)At 1,345 metres (4,413 ft), Ben Nevis is the highest peak in the UK.\nMain article: List of mountains and hills of the United Kingdom\n\nThe ten tallest mountains in the UK are all found in Scotland. The highest peaks in each part of the UK are:\n\n\n\n* Scotland: Ben Nevis, 1,345 metres (4,413 ft)\n* Wales: Snowdon (Yr Wyddfa), (Snowdonia), 1,085 metres (3,560 ft)\n* England: Scafell Pike (Cumbrian Mountains), 978 metres (3,209 ft)\n* Northern Ireland: Slieve Donard (Mourne Mountains), 852 metres (2,795 ft)\n\n\nThe ranges of mountains and hills in the UK include:\n\n\n\n* Scotland: Cairngorms, Scottish Highlands, Southern Uplands, Grampian Mountains, Monadhliath Mountains, Ochil Hills, Campsie Fells, Cuillin\n* Wales: Brecon Beacons (Bannau Brycheiniog), Cambrian Mountains (Mynyddoedd Cambria), Clwydian Hills (Bryniau Clwyd), Snowdonia (Eryri), Black Mountains (Y Mynyddoedd Duon), Preseli Hills (Y Preseli)\n* England: Cheviot Hills, Chilterns, Cotswolds, Dartmoor, Lincolnshire Wolds, Exmoor, Lake District, Malvern Hills, Mendip Hills, North Downs, Peak District, Pennines, South Downs, Shropshire Hills, Yorkshire Wolds\n* Northern Ireland: Mourne Mountains, Antrim Plateau, Sperrin Mountains\n\n\nThe lowest point of the UK is in the Fens of East Anglia, in England, parts of which lie up to 4 metres (13 ft) below sea level.\n\n\n\n### Rivers and lakes[edit]\n\n\nMain articles\n\n* List of lakes and lochs in the United Kingdom;\n* List of rivers of the United Kingdom;\n* List of waterfalls of the United Kingdom.\n\n\nThe longest river in the UK is the River Severn (220 mi; 350 km) which flows through both Wales and England.\n\n\nThe longest rivers in the UK contained fully within each of its constituent nations are:\n\n\n\n* England: River Thames (215 mi; 346 km)\n* Scotland: River Tay (117 mi; 188 km)\n* Northern Ireland: River Bann (76 mi; 122 km)\n* Wales: River Usk (78 mi; 126 km)\n\n\nThe largest lakes (by surface area) in the UK by country are:\n\n\n\n* Northern Ireland: Lough Neagh (147.39 sq mi; 381.7 km2)\n* Scotland: Loch Lomond (27.46 sq mi; 71.1 km2)\n* England: Windermere (5.69 sq mi; 14.7 km2)\n* Wales: Bala Lake (Llyn Tegid) (1.87 sq mi; 4.8 km2)\n\n\nThe deepest lake in the UK is Loch Morar with a maximum depth of 309 metres (1,014 ft); Loch Ness is second at 228 metres (748 ft) deep. The deepest lake in England is Wastwater which achieves a depth of 79 metres (259 ft).\n\n\nLoch Ness is the UK's largest lake in terms of volume.\n\n\n\n### Artificial waterways[edit]\n\n\n*Main articles:* Waterways in the United Kingdom, Canals of Great Britain, Dams and reservoirs in United Kingdom\n\n\nAs a result of its industrial history, the United Kingdom has an extensive system of canals, mostly built in the early years of the Industrial Revolution, before the rise of competition from the railways. The United Kingdom also has numerous dams and reservoirs to store water for drinking and industry. The generation of hydroelectric power is rather limited, supplying less than 2% of British electricity, mainly from the Scottish Highlands.\n\n\n\n### Coastline[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Coastline of the United Kingdom\n\n![](image)United Kingdom maritime claims\nThe UK has a coastline which measures about 12,429 km (7,723 mi).[14] The heavy indentation of the coastline helps to ensure that no location is more than 125 km (78 mi) from tidal waters.\n\n\nThe UK claims jurisdiction over the continental shelf, as defined in continental shelf orders or in accordance with agreed upon boundaries, an exclusive fishing zone of 200 nmi (370.4 km; 230.2 mi), and territorial sea of 12 nmi (22.2 km; 13.8 mi).\n\n\nThe UK has an Exclusive Economic Zone of 773,676 km2 (298,718 sq mi) in Europe. However, if all crown dependencies and overseas territories are included then the total EEZ is 6,805,586 km2 (2,627,651 sq mi) which is the 5th largest in the world.\n\n\n\n#### Inlets[edit]\n\n\n* Cardigan Bay\n* Lyme Bay\n* Bristol Channel\n* Thames Estuary\n* Morecambe Bay\n* Solway Firth\n* The Wash\n* Humber Estuary\n* Firth of Forth\n* Firth of Tay\n* Moray Firth\n* Firth of Clyde\n* Firth of Lorn\n\n\n#### Headlands[edit]\n\n\nThe geology of the United Kingdom is such that there are many headlands along its coast. A list of headlands of the United Kingdom details many of them.\n\n\n\n### Tidal flats[edit]\n\n\nA recent global remote sensing analysis suggested that there were 2,697 km2 (1,041 sq mi) of tidal flats in the United Kingdom, making it the 12th ranking country in terms of how much tidal flat occurs there.[15]\n\n\n\n### Islands[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of islands of the United Kingdom\n\nIn total, it is estimated that the UK is made up of over one thousand small islands, the majority located off the north and west coasts of Scotland. About 130 of these are inhabited according to the 2001 census.\n\n\nThe largest island in the UK is Great Britain. The largest islands by constituent country are Lewis and Harris in Scotland at 841 sq mi (2,180 km2), Wales' Anglesey at 276 sq mi (710 km2), the Isle of Wight in England at 147 sq mi (380 km2), and Rathlin Island in Northern Ireland at roughly 6 sq mi (16 km2);\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate of the United Kingdom\n\nThe climate of the UK is generally temperate, although significant local variation occurs, particularly as a result of altitude and distance from the coast. In general the south of the country is warmer than the north, and the west wetter than the east. Due to the warming influence of the Gulf Stream, the UK is significantly warmer than some other locations at a similar latitude, such as Newfoundland.\n\n\nThe prevailing winds are southwesterly, from the North Atlantic Current. More than 50% of the days are overcast.[16] There are few natural hazards, although there can be strong winds and floods, especially in winter.\n\n\nAverage annual rainfall varies from over 3,000 mm (118.1 in) in the Scottish Highlands down to 553 mm (21.8 in) in Cambridge. The county of Essex is one of the driest in the UK, with an average annual rainfall of around 600 mm (23.6 in), although it typically rains on over 100 days per year. In some years rainfall in Essex can be below 450 mm (17.7 in), less than the average annual rainfall in Jerusalem and Beirut.\n\n\nThe highest temperature recorded in the UK was 40.3 °C (104.5 °F) at Coningsby in Lincolnshire, on 20 July 2022.[17] The lowest was −27.2 °C (−17.0 °F) recorded at Braemar in the Grampian Mountains, Scotland, on 11 February 1895 and 10 January 1982 and Altnaharra, also in Scotland, on 30 December 1995.\n\n\n\n## Human geography[edit]\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n Largest urban areas of the United Kingdom(England and Wales: 2011 census built-up area;[18] Scotland: 2016 estimates settlement;[19] Northern Ireland: 2001 census urban area)[20]\n |\n| --- |\n| Rank | Urban area |  Pop. | Principal settlement | Rank | Urban area |  Pop. | Principal settlement |\n| 1 | **Greater London** | 9,787,426 | London | 11 | **Bristol** | 617,280 | Bristol |\n| 2 | **Greater Manchester** | 2,553,379 | Manchester | 12 | **Edinburgh** | 512,150 | Edinburgh |\n| 3 | **West Midlands** | 2,440,986 | Birmingham | 13 | **Leicester** | 508,916 | Leicester |\n| 4 | **West Yorkshire** | 1,777,934 | Leeds | 14 | **Belfast** | 483,418 | Belfast |\n| 5 | **Greater Glasgow** | 985,290 | Glasgow | 15 |  **Brighton & Hove** | 474,485 | Brighton |\n| 6 | **Liverpool** | 864,122 | Liverpool | 16 |  **South East Dorset** | 466,266 | Bournemouth |\n| 7 | **South Hampshire** | 855,569 | Southampton | 17 |  **Cardiff** | 390,214 | Cardiff |\n| 8 | **Tyneside** | 774,891 | Newcastle upon Tyne | 18 | **Teesside** | 376,633 | Middlesbrough |\n| 9 | **Nottingham** | 729,977 | Nottingham | 19 | **Stoke-on-Trent** | 372,775 | Stoke-on-Trent |\n| 10 | **Sheffield** | 685,368 | Sheffield | 20 |  **Coventry** | 359,262 | Coventry |\n\n![](image)The United Kingdom is composed of four parts: England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.\n![](image)The United Kingdom's cities, other large centres, and selected smaller places\n### Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of the United Kingdom\n\n### Political geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Politics of the United Kingdom\n\n#### National government[edit]\n\n\nThe UK is governed as a whole by the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Of the four countries that make the UK, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have devolved administrations and legislatures:\n\n\n\n* Northern Ireland – Northern Ireland Assembly\n* Scotland – Scottish Parliament\n* Wales – Senedd (Welsh Parliament)\n\n\nThe devolved administrations and legislatures can make laws in a number of areas, such as culture, education, local government, and environment.\n\n\nBy contrast, England has no devolved system of government, that is, the Parliament of the United Kingdom makes laws for England, as well as for reserved matters in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. England is governed by UK government ministers and legislated for by the UK parliament. The London region has a devolved assembly but proposals for elected Regional Assemblies in England were rejected in the first referendum covering North East England. (*See Government of England.*)\n\n\nThe UK (specifically, Northern Ireland) has an international land boundary with the Republic of Ireland of 499 km.[3][4] There is also a boundary between the jurisdiction of France and the UK on the Channel Tunnel.\n\n\n\n#### Local government[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Local government in England, Local government in Scotland, Local government in Wales, and Local government in Northern Ireland\n\nEach part of the UK is subdivided into further local governmental regions:\n\n\n\n* England: Unitary Authorities, county councils, district councils, parish councils\n* Wales: Principal areas, communities\n* Scotland: Council areas, communities\n* Northern Ireland: Districts\n\n\nHistorically the UK was divided into counties or shires: administrative areas through which all civil responsibilities of the government were passed. Each county or shire had a county town as its administrative centre and was divided into individual parishes that were defined along ecclesiastic boundaries.\n\n\nBetween 1889 (1890 in Scotland) and 1974, the political boundaries were based on the traditional counties, but due to changes in population centres, the traditional counties became impractical as local government areas in certain highly urbanised areas. The Local Government Act 1972 created a new system of administrative counties, designed to take account of the widely differing populations across different parts of the country.\n\n\nIn the 1990s further population growth led to more political changes on a local level. Unitary authorities were formed across the entirety of Scotland and Wales, and in larger cities in England. Many unpopular administrative counties were also abolished at this time, leading to a mixture of two-tier and single-purpose authorities. Further reorganisations are planned if and when regional assemblies in England are revisited in the future.\n\n\n\n### Economic geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economic geography of the United Kingdom\n\nThe economic geography of the UK reflects not only its current position in the global economy, but its long history both as a trading nation and an imperial power.\n\n\nThe UK led the industrial revolution and its highly urban character is a legacy of this, with all its major cities being current or former centres of various forms of manufacturing. However, this in turn was built on its exploitation of natural resources, especially coal and iron ore.\n\n\n\n#### Primary industry[edit]\n\n\nThe UK's primary industry was once dominated by the coal industry, heavily concentrated in the north, the Midlands and south Wales. This is all but gone and the major primary industry is North Sea oil. Its activity is concentrated on the UK Continental Shelf to the north-east of Scotland.\n\n\n\n#### Manufacturing[edit]\n\n\nThe UK's heavy manufacturing drove the industrial revolution. A map of the major UK cities gives a good picture of where this activity occurred, in particular Belfast, Birmingham, Glasgow, Liverpool, London, Manchester, Newcastle and Sheffield. Today there is no heavy manufacturing industry in which UK-based firms can be considered world leaders. However, areas of the UK still have a notable manufacturing base, including the Midlands which remains a strong manufacturing centre, and the North West which accounts for 60% of the United Kingdom's manufacturing output.[21] More recently, high technology firms have concentrated largely along the M4 motorway, partly because of access to Heathrow Airport, but also because of agglomeration economies.\n\n\n\n#### Finance and services[edit]\n\n\nOnce, every large city had a stock exchange. Now, the UK financial industry is concentrated overwhelmingly in the City of London and Canary Wharf, with back office and administrative operations often dispersed around the south of England. London is one of the world's great financial centres and is usually referred to as a world city. There is also a significant legal and ebusiness industry in Leeds.\n\n\n\n#### Regional disparity[edit]\n\n\nThe effect of changing economic fortune has contributed to the creation of the so-called North-South divide, in which decaying industrial and ex-industrial areas of Northern England, Scotland and Wales contrast with the wealthy, finance and technology-led southern economy. This has led successive governments to develop regional policy to try to rectify the imbalance. However, this is not to say that the north–south divide is uniform; some of the worst pockets of deprivation can be found in London, whilst parts of Cheshire and North Yorkshire are very wealthy. Nor is the North-South divide limited to the economic sphere; cultural and political divisions weigh heavily too.\n\n\n\n## Natural resources[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of the United Kingdom\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

Since prehistoric times, man has deforested much of the United Kingdom.\n\n\nAgriculture is intensive, highly mechanised, and efficient by European standards, producing about 60% of food needs with only 1% of the labour force. It contributes around 2% of GDP. Around two thirds of production is devoted to livestock, one third to arable crops.\n\n\nIn 1993, it was estimated that land use was:\n\n\n\n* Arable land: 25%\n* Permanent crops: 0%\n* Permanent pastures: 46%\n* Forests and Woodland: 10%\n* Other: 19%\n* Irrigated: 1,080 km2\n\n\nThe UK has a variety of natural resources including:\n\n\n\n* Geological: coal, petroleum, natural gas, limestone, chalk, gypsum, silica, rock salt, china clay, iron ore, tin, silver, gold, lead.\n* Agricultural: arable land, wheat, barley, sheep\n\n\nThe UK has large coal, natural gas, and oil reserves; primary energy production accounts for 10% of GDP, one of the highest shares of any industrial nation. Due to the island location of the UK, the country has great potential for generating electricity from wave power and tidal power, although these have not yet been exploited on a commercial basis.\n\n\n\n## Environment[edit]\n\n\n### Current issues[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section needs to be **updated**.

It has met Kyoto Protocol target of a 12.5% reduction from 1990 levels and intends to meet the legally binding target of a 20% cut in emissions by 2010. By 2015, to recycle or compost at least 33% of household waste. Between 1998-99 and 1999–2000, household recycling increased from 8.8% to 10.3% respectively.\n\n\nAccording to a 2018 survey for the World Wide Fund for Nature, the United Kingdom is one of the most nature-depleted countries in the world, coming in 189th place out of 218 countries.[24][25]\n\n\n\n### International agreements[edit]\n\n\nThe United Kingdom is a party to many international agreements, including:\nAir Pollution, Air Pollution-Nitrogen Oxides, Air Pollution-Sulphur 94, Air Pollution-Volatile Organic Compounds, Antarctic-Environmental Protocol, Antarctic-Marine Living Resources, Antarctic Seals, Antarctic Treaty, Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Environmental Modification, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Marine Dumping, Marine Life Conservation, Nuclear Test Ban, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Tropical Timber 83, Tropical Timber 94, Wetlands and Whaling.\n\n\nThe UK has signed, but not ratified, the international agreement on Air Pollution-Persistent Organic Pollutants.\n\n\n\n## Geography of dependent territories[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Map of the UK, overseas territories and crown dependencies at the same geographic scale\n### Crown dependencies[edit]\n\n\n* Geography of the Isle of Man\n* Geography of the Channel Islands\n\t+ Geography of Jersey\n\t+ Geography of Guernsey\n\t+ Geography of Alderney\n\t+ Geography of Sark\n\t+ Geography of Herm\n\n\n### Overseas territories[edit]\n\n\n* Geography of Anguilla\n* Geography of Bermuda\n* Geography of the British Antarctic Territory\n* Geography of the British Indian Ocean Territory\n* Geography of the British Virgin Islands\n* Geography of the Cayman Islands\n* Geography of the Falkland Islands\n* Geography of Gibraltar\n* Geography of Montserrat\n* Geography of the Pitcairn Islands\n* Geography of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha\n* Geography of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands\n* Geography of Akrotiri and Dhekelia\n* Geography of the Turks and Caicos Islands\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* British Overseas Territories\n* City status in the United Kingdom\n* Conservation in the United Kingdom\n* Demographics of the United Kingdom\n* Extreme points of the United Kingdom\n* Centre points of the United Kingdom\n* Geography of England\n* Geography of Europe\n* Geography of Ireland\n* Geography of Scotland\n* Geography of Wales\n* List of caves in the United Kingdom\n* List of conurbations in the United Kingdom\n* List of places in the United Kingdom\n* North-South divide in the United Kingdom\n* Towns of the United Kingdom\n* Transport in the United Kingdom\n\t+ Rail transport in the United Kingdom\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Does not include the three Crown Dependencies (768 km2 or 297 sq mi) and the 14 overseas territories (1,742,857 km2 or 672,921 sq mi), shown separately.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This article includes a list of general references, but **it lacks sufficient corresponding inline citations**.

With a total area of approximately 248,532 square kilometres (95,960 sq mi), the UK occupies the major part of the British Isles archipelago and includes the island of Great Britain, the north-eastern one-sixth of the island of Ireland and many smaller surrounding islands.[1] It is the world's 7th largest island country.[2] The mainland areas lie between latitudes 49°N and 59°N (the Shetland Islands reach to nearly 61°N), and longitudes 8°W to 2°E. The Royal Observatory, Greenwich, in south-east London, is the defining point of the Prime Meridian.\n\n\nThe UK lies between the North Atlantic and the North Sea, and comes within 35 km (22 mi) of the north-west coast of France, from which it is separated by the English Channel. It shares a 499 km (310 mi) international land boundary with the Republic of Ireland.[3][4] The Channel Tunnel bored beneath the English Channel now links the UK with France.\n\n\nThe British Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies are covered in their own respective articles, see below.\n\n\n\n\n## Area[edit]\n\n\nThe total area of the United Kingdom according to the Office for National Statistics is 248,532 square kilometres (95,960 sq mi), comprising the island of Great Britain, the northeastern one-sixth of the island of Ireland (Northern Ireland) and many smaller islands. This makes it the 7th largest island country in the world.[2] England is the largest country of the United Kingdom, at 132,938 square kilometres (51,330 sq mi) accounting for just over half the total area of the UK. Scotland at 80,239 square kilometres (30,980 sq mi), is second largest, accounting for about a third of the area of the UK. Wales and Northern Ireland are much smaller, covering 21,225 and 14,130 square kilometres (8,200 and 5,460 sq mi) respectively.[5]\n\n\nThe area of the countries of the United Kingdom is set out in the table below. Information about the area of England, the largest country, is also broken down by region.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Rank\n | Name\n | Area\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | England\n∟ South West[6]\n∟ East of England\n∟ South East[7]\n∟ East Midlands\n∟ Yorkshire and the Humber\n∟ North West[8]\n∟ West Midlands[9]\n∟ North East[10]\n∟ London[11]\n | 132,938 km2\n23,837 km2\n19,120 km2\n19,096 km2\n15,627 km2\n15,420 km2\n14,165 km2\n12,998 km2\n8,592 km2\n1,572 km2\n |\n| 2\n | Scotland | 80,239 km2 |\n| 3\n | Wales | 21,225 km2 |\n| 4\n | Northern Ireland | 14,130 km2 |\n|  | United Kingdom | 248,532 km2 |\n|  | Overseas territories | 1,727,570 km2 |\n\n\nThe British Antarctic Territory, which covers an area of 1,709,400 km2 (660,000 sq mi) is geographically the largest of the British Overseas Territories followed by the Falkland Islands which covers an area of 12,173 km2 (4,700 sq mi). The remaining twelve overseas territories cover an area 5,997 km2 (2,315 sq mi).\n\n\nOther countries with very similar land areas to the United Kingdom include Guinea (slightly larger), Uganda, Ghana and Romania (all slightly smaller). The UK is the world's 80th largest country by land area and the 10th largest in Europe (if European Russia is included).\n\n\n\n## Physical geography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)UK's topography\n![](image)As this geological map of Great Britain demonstrates, the geology of the UK is varied and complex.\nThe physical geography of the UK varies greatly. England consists of mostly lowland terrain, with upland or mountainous terrain only found north-west of the Tees–Exe line. The upland areas include the Lake District, the Pennines, North York Moors, Exmoor and Dartmoor. The lowland areas are typically traversed by ranges of low hills, frequently composed of chalk, and flat plains. Scotland is the most mountainous country in the UK and its physical geography is distinguished by the Highland Boundary Fault which traverses the Scottish mainland from Helensburgh to Stonehaven. The faultline separates the two distinctively different regions of the Highlands to the north and west, and the Lowlands to the south and east. The Highlands are predominantly mountainous, containing the majority of Scotland's mountainous landscape, while the Lowlands contain flatter land, especially across the Central Lowlands, with upland and mountainous terrain located at the Southern Uplands. Wales is mostly mountainous, though south Wales is less mountainous than north and mid Wales. Northern Ireland consists of mostly hilly landscape and its geography includes the Mourne Mountains as well as Lough Neagh, at 388 square kilometres (150 sq mi), the largest body of water in the UK.[12]\n\n\nThe overall geomorphology of the UK was shaped by a combination of forces including tectonics and climate change, in particular glaciation in northern and western areas.\n\n\nThe tallest mountain in the UK (and British Isles) is Ben Nevis, in the Grampian Mountains, Scotland. The longest river is the River Severn which flows from Wales into England. The largest lake by surface area is Lough Neagh in Northern Ireland, though Scotland's Loch Ness has the largest volume.\n\n\n\n### Geology[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Geology of Great Britain and Geology of Ireland\n\nThe geology of the UK is complex and diverse, a result of it being subject to a variety of plate tectonic processes over a very extended period of time. Changing latitude and sea levels have been important factors in the nature of sedimentary sequences, whilst successive continental collisions have affected its geological structure with major faulting and folding being a legacy of each orogeny (mountain-building period), often associated with volcanic activity and the metamorphism of existing rock sequences. As a result of this eventful geological history, the UK shows a rich variety of landscapes.[13]\n\n\n\n#### Precambrian[edit]\n\n\nThe oldest rocks in the British Isles are the Lewisian gneisses, metamorphic rocks found in the far north-west of Scotland and in the Hebrides (with a few small outcrops elsewhere), which date from at least 2,700 Ma (Ma = million years ago). South and east of the gneisses are a complex mixture of rocks forming the North West Highlands and Grampian Highlands in Scotland. These are essentially the remains of folded sedimentary rocks that were deposited between 1,000 Ma and 670 Ma over the gneiss on what was then the floor of the Iapetus Ocean.\n\n\n\n#### Palaeozoic[edit]\n\n\nAt 520 Ma, what is now Great Britain was split between two continents; the north of Scotland was located on the continent of Laurentia at about 20° south of the equator, while the rest of the country was on the continent of Gondwana near the Antarctic Circle. In Gondwana, England and Wales were largely submerged under a shallow sea studded with volcanic islands. The remains of these islands underlie much of central England with small outcrops visible in many places.\n\n\nAbout 500 Ma southern Britain, the east coast of North America and south-east Newfoundland broke away from Gondwana to form the continent of Avalonia, which by 440 Ma had drifted to about 30° south. During this period north Wales was subject to volcanic activity. The remains of these volcanoes are still visible, one example of which is Rhobell Fawr dating from 510 Ma. Large quantities of volcanic lava and ash known as the Borrowdale Volcanics covered the Lake District and this can still be seen in the form of mountains such as Helvellyn and Scafell Pike.\n\n\nBetween 425 and 400 Ma Avalonia had joined with the continent of Baltica, and the combined landmass collided with Laurentia at about 20° south, joining the southern and northern halves of Great Britain together. The resulting Caledonian Orogeny produced an Alpine-style mountain range in much of north and west Britain.\n\n\nThe collision between continents continued during the Devonian period, producing uplift and subsequent erosion, resulting in the deposition of numerous sedimentary rock layers in lowlands and seas. The Old Red Sandstone and the contemporary volcanics and marine sediments found in Devon originated from these processes.\n\n\nAround 360 Ma Great Britain was lying at the equator, covered by the warm shallow waters of the Rheic Ocean, during which time the Carboniferous Limestone was deposited, as found in the Mendip Hills and the Peak District of Derbyshire. Later, river deltas formed and the sediments deposited were colonised by swamps and rain forest. It was in this environment that the Coal Measures were formed, the source of the majority of Britain's extensive coal reserves.\n\n\nAround 280 Ma the Variscan orogeny mountain-building period occurred, again due to collision of continental plates, causing major deformation in south-west England. The general region of Variscan folding was south of an east–west line roughly from south Pembrokeshire to Kent. Towards the end of this period granite was formed beneath the overlying rocks of Devon and Cornwall, now exposed at Dartmoor and Bodmin Moor.\n\n\nBy the end of the Carboniferous period the various continents of the Earth had fused to form the super-continent of Pangaea. Britain was located in the interior of Pangea where it was subject to a hot arid desert climate with frequent flash floods leaving deposits that formed beds of red sedimentary rock.\n\n\n\n#### Mesozoic[edit]\n\n\nAs Pangaea drifted during the Triassic, Great Britain moved away from the equator until it was between 20° and 30° north. The remnants of the Variscan uplands in France to the south were eroded down, resulting in layers of the New Red Sandstone being deposited across central England.\n\n\nPangaea began to break up at the start of the Jurassic period. Sea levels rose and Britain drifted on the Eurasian Plate to between 31° and 40° north. Much of Britain was under water again, and sedimentary rocks were deposited and can now be found underlying much of England from the Cleveland Hills of Yorkshire to the Jurassic Coast in Dorset. These include sandstones, greensands, oolitic limestone of the Cotswold Hills, corallian limestone of the Vale of White Horse and the Isle of Portland. The burial of algae and bacteria below the mud of the seafloor during this time resulted in the formation of North Sea oil and natural gas.\n\n\n\n![](image)1815 geological by William Smith\nThe modern continents having formed, the Cretaceous saw the formation of the Atlantic Ocean, gradually separating northern Scotland from North America. The land underwent a series of uplifts to form a fertile plain. After 20 million years or so, the seas started to flood the land again until much of Britain was again below the sea, though sea levels frequently changed. Chalk and flints were deposited over much of Great Britain, now notably exposed at the White Cliffs of Dover and the Seven Sisters, and also forming Salisbury Plain.\n\n\n\n#### Cenozoic[edit]\n\n\nBetween 63 and 52 Ma, the last volcanic rocks in Great Britain were formed. The major eruptions at this time produced the Antrim Plateau, the basaltic columns of the Giant's Causeway and Lundy Island in the Bristol Channel.\n\n\nThe Alpine Orogeny that took place in Europe about 50 Ma, was responsible for the folding of strata in southern England, producing the London Basin syncline, the Weald-Artois Anticline to the south, the North Downs, South Downs and Chiltern Hills.\n\n\nDuring the period the North Sea formed, Britain was uplifted. Some of this uplift was along old lines of weakness left from the Caledonian and Variscan Orogenies long before. The uplifted areas were then eroded, and further sediments, such as the London Clay, were deposited over southern England.\n\n\nThe major changes during the last 2 million years were brought about by several recent ice ages. The most severe was the Anglian Glaciation, with ice up to 1,000 m (3,300 ft) thick that reached as far south as London and Bristol. This took place between about 478,000 to 424,000 years ago, and was responsible for the diversion of the River Thames onto its present course. During the most recent Devensian glaciation, which ended a mere 10,000 years ago, the icesheet reached south to Wolverhampton and Cardiff. Among the features left behind by the ice are the fjords of the west coast of Scotland, the U-shaped valleys of the Lake District and erratics (blocks of rock) that have been transported from the Oslo region of Norway and deposited on the coast of Yorkshire.\n\n\nAmongst the most significant geological features created during the last twelve thousand years are the peat deposits of Scotland, and of coastal and upland areas of England and Wales.\n\n\nAt the present time Scotland is continuing to rise as a result of the weight of Devensian ice being lifted. Southern and eastern England is sinking, generally estimated at 1 mm (1⁄25 in) per year, with the London area sinking at double the speed partly due to the continuing compaction of the recent clay deposits.\n\n\n\n### Mountains and hills[edit]\n\n\n![](image)At 1,345 metres (4,413 ft), Ben Nevis is the highest peak in the UK.\nMain article: List of mountains and hills of the United Kingdom\n\nThe ten tallest mountains in the UK are all found in Scotland. The highest peaks in each part of the UK are:\n\n\n\n* Scotland: Ben Nevis, 1,345 metres (4,413 ft)\n* Wales: Snowdon (Yr Wyddfa), (Snowdonia), 1,085 metres (3,560 ft)\n* England: Scafell Pike (Cumbrian Mountains), 978 metres (3,209 ft)\n* Northern Ireland: Slieve Donard (Mourne Mountains), 852 metres (2,795 ft)\n\n\nThe ranges of mountains and hills in the UK include:\n\n\n\n* Scotland: Cairngorms, Scottish Highlands, Southern Uplands, Grampian Mountains, Monadhliath Mountains, Ochil Hills, Campsie Fells, Cuillin\n* Wales: Brecon Beacons (Bannau Brycheiniog), Cambrian Mountains (Mynyddoedd Cambria), Clwydian Hills (Bryniau Clwyd), Snowdonia (Eryri), Black Mountains (Y Mynyddoedd Duon), Preseli Hills (Y Preseli)\n* England: Cheviot Hills, Chilterns, Cotswolds, Dartmoor, Lincolnshire Wolds, Exmoor, Lake District, Malvern Hills, Mendip Hills, North Downs, Peak District, Pennines, South Downs, Shropshire Hills, Yorkshire Wolds\n* Northern Ireland: Mourne Mountains, Antrim Plateau, Sperrin Mountains\n\n\nThe lowest point of the UK is in the Fens of East Anglia, in England, parts of which lie up to 4 metres (13 ft) below sea level.\n\n\n\n### Rivers and lakes[edit]\n\n\nMain articles\n\n* List of lakes and lochs in the United Kingdom;\n* List of rivers of the United Kingdom;\n* List of waterfalls of the United Kingdom.\n\n\nThe longest river in the UK is the River Severn (220 mi; 350 km) which flows through both Wales and England.\n\n\nThe longest rivers in the UK contained fully within each of its constituent nations are:\n\n\n\n* England: River Thames (215 mi; 346 km)\n* Scotland: River Tay (117 mi; 188 km)\n* Northern Ireland: River Bann (76 mi; 122 km)\n* Wales: River Usk (78 mi; 126 km)\n\n\nThe largest lakes (by surface area) in the UK by country are:\n\n\n\n* Northern Ireland: Lough Neagh (147.39 sq mi; 381.7 km2)\n* Scotland: Loch Lomond (27.46 sq mi; 71.1 km2)\n* England: Windermere (5.69 sq mi; 14.7 km2)\n* Wales: Bala Lake (Llyn Tegid) (1.87 sq mi; 4.8 km2)\n\n\nThe deepest lake in the UK is Loch Morar with a maximum depth of 309 metres (1,014 ft); Loch Ness is second at 228 metres (748 ft) deep. The deepest lake in England is Wastwater which achieves a depth of 79 metres (259 ft).\n\n\nLoch Ness is the UK's largest lake in terms of volume.\n\n\n\n### Artificial waterways[edit]\n\n\n*Main articles:* Waterways in the United Kingdom, Canals of Great Britain, Dams and reservoirs in United Kingdom\n\n\nAs a result of its industrial history, the United Kingdom has an extensive system of canals, mostly built in the early years of the Industrial Revolution, before the rise of competition from the railways. The United Kingdom also has numerous dams and reservoirs to store water for drinking and industry. The generation of hydroelectric power is rather limited, supplying less than 2% of British electricity, mainly from the Scottish Highlands.\n\n\n\n### Coastline[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Coastline of the United Kingdom\n\n![](image)United Kingdom maritime claims\nThe UK has a coastline which measures about 12,429 km (7,723 mi).[14] The heavy indentation of the coastline helps to ensure that no location is more than 125 km (78 mi) from tidal waters.\n\n\nThe UK claims jurisdiction over the continental shelf, as defined in continental shelf orders or in accordance with agreed upon boundaries, an exclusive fishing zone of 200 nmi (370.4 km; 230.2 mi), and territorial sea of 12 nmi (22.2 km; 13.8 mi).\n\n\nThe UK has an Exclusive Economic Zone of 773,676 km2 (298,718 sq mi) in Europe. However, if all crown dependencies and overseas territories are included then the total EEZ is 6,805,586 km2 (2,627,651 sq mi) which is the 5th largest in the world.\n\n\n\n#### Inlets[edit]\n\n\n* Cardigan Bay\n* Lyme Bay\n* Bristol Channel\n* Thames Estuary\n* Morecambe Bay\n* Solway Firth\n* The Wash\n* Humber Estuary\n* Firth of Forth\n* Firth of Tay\n* Moray Firth\n* Firth of Clyde\n* Firth of Lorn\n\n\n#### Headlands[edit]\n\n\nThe geology of the United Kingdom is such that there are many headlands along its coast. A list of headlands of the United Kingdom details many of them.\n\n\n\n### Tidal flats[edit]\n\n\nA recent global remote sensing analysis suggested that there were 2,697 km2 (1,041 sq mi) of tidal flats in the United Kingdom, making it the 12th ranking country in terms of how much tidal flat occurs there.[15]\n\n\n\n### Islands[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of islands of the United Kingdom\n\nIn total, it is estimated that the UK is made up of over one thousand small islands, the majority located off the north and west coasts of Scotland. About 130 of these are inhabited according to the 2001 census.\n\n\nThe largest island in the UK is Great Britain. The largest islands by constituent country are Lewis and Harris in Scotland at 841 sq mi (2,180 km2), Wales' Anglesey at 276 sq mi (710 km2), the Isle of Wight in England at 147 sq mi (380 km2), and Rathlin Island in Northern Ireland at roughly 6 sq mi (16 km2);\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate of the United Kingdom\n\nThe climate of the UK is generally temperate, although significant local variation occurs, particularly as a result of altitude and distance from the coast. In general the south of the country is warmer than the north, and the west wetter than the east. Due to the warming influence of the Gulf Stream, the UK is significantly warmer than some other locations at a similar latitude, such as Newfoundland.\n\n\nThe prevailing winds are southwesterly, from the North Atlantic Current. More than 50% of the days are overcast.[16] There are few natural hazards, although there can be strong winds and floods, especially in winter.\n\n\nAverage annual rainfall varies from over 3,000 mm (118.1 in) in the Scottish Highlands down to 553 mm (21.8 in) in Cambridge. The county of Essex is one of the driest in the UK, with an average annual rainfall of around 600 mm (23.6 in), although it typically rains on over 100 days per year. In some years rainfall in Essex can be below 450 mm (17.7 in), less than the average annual rainfall in Jerusalem and Beirut.\n\n\nThe highest temperature recorded in the UK was 40.3 °C (104.5 °F) at Coningsby in Lincolnshire, on 20 July 2022.[17] The lowest was −27.2 °C (−17.0 °F) recorded at Braemar in the Grampian Mountains, Scotland, on 11 February 1895 and 10 January 1982 and Altnaharra, also in Scotland, on 30 December 1995.\n\n\n\n## Human geography[edit]\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n Largest urban areas of the United Kingdom(England and Wales: 2011 census built-up area;[18] Scotland: 2016 estimates settlement;[19] Northern Ireland: 2001 census urban area)[20]\n |\n| --- |\n| Rank | Urban area |  Pop. | Principal settlement | Rank | Urban area |  Pop. | Principal settlement |\n| 1 | **Greater London** | 9,787,426 | London | 11 | **Bristol** | 617,280 | Bristol |\n| 2 | **Greater Manchester** | 2,553,379 | Manchester | 12 | **Edinburgh** | 512,150 | Edinburgh |\n| 3 | **West Midlands** | 2,440,986 | Birmingham | 13 | **Leicester** | 508,916 | Leicester |\n| 4 | **West Yorkshire** | 1,777,934 | Leeds | 14 | **Belfast** | 483,418 | Belfast |\n| 5 | **Greater Glasgow** | 985,290 | Glasgow | 15 |  **Brighton & Hove** | 474,485 | Brighton |\n| 6 | **Liverpool** | 864,122 | Liverpool | 16 |  **South East Dorset** | 466,266 | Bournemouth |\n| 7 | **South Hampshire** | 855,569 | Southampton | 17 |  **Cardiff** | 390,214 | Cardiff |\n| 8 | **Tyneside** | 774,891 | Newcastle upon Tyne | 18 | **Teesside** | 376,633 | Middlesbrough |\n| 9 | **Nottingham** | 729,977 | Nottingham | 19 | **Stoke-on-Trent** | 372,775 | Stoke-on-Trent |\n| 10 | **Sheffield** | 685,368 | Sheffield | 20 |  **Coventry** | 359,262 | Coventry |\n\n![](image)The United Kingdom is composed of four parts: England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.\n![](image)The United Kingdom's cities, other large centres, and selected smaller places\n### Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of the United Kingdom\n\n### Political geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Politics of the United Kingdom\n\n#### National government[edit]\n\n\nThe UK is governed as a whole by the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Of the four countries that make the UK, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have devolved administrations and legislatures:\n\n\n\n* Northern Ireland – Northern Ireland Assembly\n* Scotland – Scottish Parliament\n* Wales – Senedd (Welsh Parliament)\n\n\nThe devolved administrations and legislatures can make laws in a number of areas, such as culture, education, local government, and environment.\n\n\nBy contrast, England has no devolved system of government, that is, the Parliament of the United Kingdom makes laws for England, as well as for reserved matters in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. England is governed by UK government ministers and legislated for by the UK parliament. The London region has a devolved assembly but proposals for elected Regional Assemblies in England were rejected in the first referendum covering North East England. (*See Government of England.*)\n\n\nThe UK (specifically, Northern Ireland) has an international land boundary with the Republic of Ireland of 499 km.[3][4] There is also a boundary between the jurisdiction of France and the UK on the Channel Tunnel.\n\n\n\n#### Local government[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Local government in England, Local government in Scotland, Local government in Wales, and Local government in Northern Ireland\n\nEach part of the UK is subdivided into further local governmental regions:\n\n\n\n* England: Unitary Authorities, county councils, district councils, parish councils\n* Wales: Principal areas, communities\n* Scotland: Council areas, communities\n* Northern Ireland: Districts\n\n\nHistorically the UK was divided into counties or shires: administrative areas through which all civil responsibilities of the government were passed. Each county or shire had a county town as its administrative centre and was divided into individual parishes that were defined along ecclesiastic boundaries.\n\n\nBetween 1889 (1890 in Scotland) and 1974, the political boundaries were based on the traditional counties, but due to changes in population centres, the traditional counties became impractical as local government areas in certain highly urbanised areas. The Local Government Act 1972 created a new system of administrative counties, designed to take account of the widely differing populations across different parts of the country.\n\n\nIn the 1990s further population growth led to more political changes on a local level. Unitary authorities were formed across the entirety of Scotland and Wales, and in larger cities in England. Many unpopular administrative counties were also abolished at this time, leading to a mixture of two-tier and single-purpose authorities. Further reorganisations are planned if and when regional assemblies in England are revisited in the future.\n\n\n\n### Economic geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economic geography of the United Kingdom\n\nThe economic geography of the UK reflects not only its current position in the global economy, but its long history both as a trading nation and an imperial power.\n\n\nThe UK led the industrial revolution and its highly urban character is a legacy of this, with all its major cities being current or former centres of various forms of manufacturing. However, this in turn was built on its exploitation of natural resources, especially coal and iron ore.\n\n\n\n#### Primary industry[edit]\n\n\nThe UK's primary industry was once dominated by the coal industry, heavily concentrated in the north, the Midlands and south Wales. This is all but gone and the major primary industry is North Sea oil. Its activity is concentrated on the UK Continental Shelf to the north-east of Scotland.\n\n\n\n#### Manufacturing[edit]\n\n\nThe UK's heavy manufacturing drove the industrial revolution. A map of the major UK cities gives a good picture of where this activity occurred, in particular Belfast, Birmingham, Glasgow, Liverpool, London, Manchester, Newcastle and Sheffield. Today there is no heavy manufacturing industry in which UK-based firms can be considered world leaders. However, areas of the UK still have a notable manufacturing base, including the Midlands which remains a strong manufacturing centre, and the North West which accounts for 60% of the United Kingdom's manufacturing output.[21] More recently, high technology firms have concentrated largely along the M4 motorway, partly because of access to Heathrow Airport, but also because of agglomeration economies.\n\n\n\n#### Finance and services[edit]\n\n\nOnce, every large city had a stock exchange. Now, the UK financial industry is concentrated overwhelmingly in the City of London and Canary Wharf, with back office and administrative operations often dispersed around the south of England. London is one of the world's great financial centres and is usually referred to as a world city. There is also a significant legal and ebusiness industry in Leeds.\n\n\n\n#### Regional disparity[edit]\n\n\nThe effect of changing economic fortune has contributed to the creation of the so-called North-South divide, in which decaying industrial and ex-industrial areas of Northern England, Scotland and Wales contrast with the wealthy, finance and technology-led southern economy. This has led successive governments to develop regional policy to try to rectify the imbalance. However, this is not to say that the north–south divide is uniform; some of the worst pockets of deprivation can be found in London, whilst parts of Cheshire and North Yorkshire are very wealthy. Nor is the North-South divide limited to the economic sphere; cultural and political divisions weigh heavily too.\n\n\n\n## Natural resources[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of the United Kingdom\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

Since prehistoric times, man has deforested much of the United Kingdom.\n\n\nAgriculture is intensive, highly mechanised, and efficient by European standards, producing about 60% of food needs with only 1% of the labour force. It contributes around 2% of GDP. Around two thirds of production is devoted to livestock, one third to arable crops.\n\n\nIn 1993, it was estimated that land use was:\n\n\n\n* Arable land: 25%\n* Permanent crops: 0%\n* Permanent pastures: 46%\n* Forests and Woodland: 10%\n* Other: 19%\n* Irrigated: 1,080 km2\n\n\nThe UK has a variety of natural resources including:\n\n\n\n* Geological: coal, petroleum, natural gas, limestone, chalk, gypsum, silica, rock salt, china clay, iron ore, tin, silver, gold, lead.\n* Agricultural: arable land, wheat, barley, sheep\n\n\nThe UK has large coal, natural gas, and oil reserves; primary energy production accounts for 10% of GDP, one of the highest shares of any industrial nation. Due to the island location of the UK, the country has great potential for generating electricity from wave power and tidal power, although these have not yet been exploited on a commercial basis.\n\n\n\n## Environment[edit]\n\n\n### Current issues[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section needs to be **updated**.

It has met Kyoto Protocol target of a 12.5% reduction from 1990 levels and intends to meet the legally binding target of a 20% cut in emissions by 2010. By 2015, to recycle or compost at least 33% of household waste. Between 1998-99 and 1999–2000, household recycling increased from 8.8% to 10.3% respectively.\n\n\nAccording to a 2018 survey for the World Wide Fund for Nature, the United Kingdom is one of the most nature-depleted countries in the world, coming in 189th place out of 218 countries.[24][25]\n\n\n\n### International agreements[edit]\n\n\nThe United Kingdom is a party to many international agreements, including:\nAir Pollution, Air Pollution-Nitrogen Oxides, Air Pollution-Sulphur 94, Air Pollution-Volatile Organic Compounds, Antarctic-Environmental Protocol, Antarctic-Marine Living Resources, Antarctic Seals, Antarctic Treaty, Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Environmental Modification, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Marine Dumping, Marine Life Conservation, Nuclear Test Ban, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Tropical Timber 83, Tropical Timber 94, Wetlands and Whaling.\n\n\nThe UK has signed, but not ratified, the international agreement on Air Pollution-Persistent Organic Pollutants.\n\n\n\n## Geography of dependent territories[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Map of the UK, overseas territories and crown dependencies at the same geographic scale\n### Crown dependencies[edit]\n\n\n* Geography of the Isle of Man\n* Geography of the Channel Islands\n\t+ Geography of Jersey\n\t+ Geography of Guernsey\n\t+ Geography of Alderney\n\t+ Geography of Sark\n\t+ Geography of Herm\n\n\n### Overseas territories[edit]\n\n\n* Geography of Anguilla\n* Geography of Bermuda\n* Geography of the British Antarctic Territory\n* Geography of the British Indian Ocean Territory\n* Geography of the British Virgin Islands\n* Geography of the Cayman Islands\n* Geography of the Falkland Islands\n* Geography of Gibraltar\n* Geography of Montserrat\n* Geography of the Pitcairn Islands\n* Geography of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha\n* Geography of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands\n* Geography of Akrotiri and Dhekelia\n* Geography of the Turks and Caicos Islands\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* British Overseas Territories\n* City status in the United Kingdom\n* Conservation in the United Kingdom\n* Demographics of the United Kingdom\n* Extreme points of the United Kingdom\n* Centre points of the United Kingdom\n* Geography of England\n* Geography of Europe\n* Geography of Ireland\n* Geography of Scotland\n* Geography of Wales\n* List of caves in the United Kingdom\n* List of conurbations in the United Kingdom\n* List of places in the United Kingdom\n* North-South divide in the United Kingdom\n* Towns of the United Kingdom\n* Transport in the United Kingdom\n\t+ Rail transport in the United Kingdom\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Does not include the three Crown Dependencies (768 km2 or 297 sq mi) and the 14 overseas territories (1,742,857 km2 or 672,921 sq mi), shown separately.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This article includes a list of general references, but **it lacks sufficient corresponding inline citations**.

The northern border of the United States with Canada is the world's longest bi-national land border.\n\n\n\n\n## Area[edit]\n\n\nFrom 1989 through 1996, the total area of the US was listed as 9,372,610 km2 (3,618,780 sq mi) (land and inland water only). The listed total area changed to 9,629,091 km2 (3,717,813 sq mi) in 1997 (Great Lakes area and coastal waters added), to 9,631,418 km2 (3,718,711 sq mi) in 2004, to 9,631,420 km2 (3,718,710 sq mi) in 2006, and to 9,826,630 km2 (3,794,080 sq mi) in 2007 (territorial waters added). Currently, the CIA *World Factbook* gives 9,826,675 km2 (3,794,100 sq mi),[7] the United Nations Statistics Division gives 9,629,091 km2 (3,717,813 sq mi),[8] and the *Encyclopedia Britannica* gives 9,522,055 km2 (3,676,486 sq mi) (Great Lakes area included but not coastal waters).[9] These sources consider only the 50 states and the Federal District and exclude overseas territories. The US has the 2nd largest Exclusive Economic Zone of 11,351,000 km2 (4,383,000 sq mi).\n\n\nBy total area (water as well as land), the United States is either slightly larger or smaller than the People's Republic of China, making it the world's third or fourth-largest country. China and the United States are smaller than Russia and Canada in total area but are larger than Brazil. By land area only (exclusive of waters), the United States is the world's third largest country, after Russia and China, with Canada in fourth. Whether the US or China is the third largest country by total area depends on two factors: (1) the validity of China's claim on Aksai Chin and Trans-Karakoram Tract (both these territories are also claimed by India, so are not counted); and (2) how the US calculates its surface area. Since the initial publishing of the World Factbook, the CIA has updated the total area of the United States several times.[10]\n\n\n\n## General characteristics[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Borders of the United States\n\n![](image)A satellite image of the contiguous United States, where temperate and subtropical forests of deciduous, coniferous, broadleaved evergreen, mixed vegetation, grasslands, montane forests, and croplands prevail are prevalent in the east, transitioning to prairies, boreal forests, the Rockies in the west, and deserts in the southwest. Much of the country's population is centered around the Great Lakes and Atlantic states.\n![](image)A satellite image of Hawaii, where volcanoes prevail on the Big Island; the islands have rugged coastlines, sandy beaches, and a tropical environment, though temperatures and humidity tend to be less extreme because of nearly constant trade winds from the east.\nThe United States shares land borders with Canada to the north and Mexico to the south, a territorial water border with Russia in the northwest, and two territorial water borders in the southeast between Florida and Cuba, and Florida and the Bahamas. The contiguous 48 states are otherwise bounded by the Pacific Ocean on the west, the Atlantic Ocean on the east, and the Gulf of Mexico to the southeast. Alaska borders the Pacific Ocean to the south and southwest, the Bering Strait to the west, and the Arctic Ocean to the north; Hawaii lies far to the southwest of the mainland in the Pacific Ocean.\n\n\nForty-eight of the states are in the single region between Canada and Mexico. This group is referred to, with varying precision and formality, as the *contiguous United States*, and as the \"Lower 48\". Alaska, which is included in the term \"continental United States\", is located at the northwestern end of North America.\n\n\nThe nation's capital city, Washington, D.C., was established in 1800 after being relocated there from Philadelphia. It was established as a federal district located on land donated by the state of Maryland; Virginia also donated land, but it was returned in 1849. The United States also has overseas territories with varying levels of autonomy and organization, including the Caribbean territories of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, formerly known as the Danish Virgin Islands and purchased by the United States at the beginning of World War II, the Pacific territories of American Samoa, Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands, and several uninhabited island territories. Some of the territories acquired were part of the territorial evolution of the United States or a product of the nation's effort to gain access to the east.\n\n\nNearly all of the United States is in the Northern Hemisphere with the exception of American Samoa and Jarvis Island.[11]\n\n\n\n## Physiographic divisions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A physiographical map of the contiguous 48 states of the U.S. and indicating the age of the exposed surface and the type of terrain\n![](image)An aerial photo over northern Ohio; much of the central United States is covered by relatively flat, arable land.\nWithin the continental U.S. there are eight distinct physiographic divisions. [12] These major divisions are:\n\n\n\n* Laurentian Upland – part of the Canadian Shield that extends into the northern United States Great Lakes area.\n* Atlantic Plain – the coastal regions of the eastern and southern parts include the continental shelf, the Atlantic Coast and the Gulf Coast.\n* Appalachian Highlands – lying on the eastern side of the United States, it includes the Appalachian Mountains, the Watchung Mountains, the Adirondacks and New England province originally containing the Great Eastern Forest, a stretch of mixed temperature and subtropical montane forests, some of which are rainforests.\n* Interior Plains – part of the interior continental United States, it includes the Great Plains, as well as a number of highland and mountainous regions, like the Black Hills, dense cave systems, painted hills and badland features.\n* Interior Highlands – also part of the interior continental United States, this division includes the Ozark Plateau, the Ouachita Mountains, and other smaller mountain systems. This region is located largely in the warm temperate/subtropical moist and dry forest biomes.\n* Rocky Mountain System – one branch of the Cordilleran system lying far inland in the western states.\n* Intermontane Plateaus – also divided into the Columbia Plateau, the Colorado Plateau and the Basin and Range Province, it is a system of plateaus, basins, ranges and gorges between the Rocky and Pacific Mountain Systems. It is the setting for the Grand Canyon, the Great Basin and Death Valley.\n* Pacific Mountain System – the coastal mountain ranges and features in the west coast of the United States.\n\n\n![](image)Denali, also known as Mount McKinley, in Alaska, is the highest land-based mountain in the world, at 20,310 ft (6,190.5 m).\n![](image)The Grand Canyon, seen here from Moran Point, is among the most famous locations in the country.\nThe eastern United States has a varied topography. A broad, flat coastal plain lines the Atlantic and Gulf shores from the Texas-Mexico border to New York City, and includes the Florida peninsula. This broad coastal plain and barrier islands make up the widest and longest beaches in the United States, much of it composed of soft, white sands. The Florida Keys are a string of coral islands that reach the southernmost city on the United States mainland at Key West in South Florida. \n\n\nAreas further inland feature rolling hills, mountains, and a diverse collection of temperate and subtropical moist and wet forests. Parts of interior Florida and South Carolina are also home to sandhill communities. The Appalachian Mountains form a line of low mountains separating the eastern seaboard from the Great Lakes and the Mississippi basins. New England features rocky seacoasts and rugged mountains with peaks up to 6,200 feet and valleys dotted with rivers and streams. Offshore islands dot the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. A recent global remote sensing analysis suggested that there were 6,622 km² of tidal flats in the United States, making it the 4th ranked country in terms of tidal flat area.[13]\n\n\nThe five Great Lakes are located in the north-central portion of the country, four of them forming part of the border with Canada; only Lake Michigan is situated entirely within the United States. The southeast United States, generally stretching from the Ohio River southwards, includes a variety of warm temperate and subtropical moist and wet forests, as well as warm temperate and subtropical dry forests nearer the Great Plains in the west of the region. West of the Appalachians lies the lush Mississippi River basin and two large eastern tributaries, the Ohio River and the Tennessee River. The Ohio and Tennessee valleys and the Midwest consist largely of rolling hills, interior highlands and small mountains, jungle-like marsh and swampland near the Ohio River, and productive farmland, stretching south to the Gulf Coast. The Midwest also has a vast amount of cave systems.\n\n\nThe Great Plains lie west of the Mississippi River and east of the Rocky Mountains. A large portion of the country's agricultural products are grown in the Great Plains. Before their general conversion to farmland, the Great Plains were noted for their extensive grasslands, from tallgrass prairie in the eastern plains to shortgrass steppe in the western High Plains. Elevation rises gradually from less than a few hundred feet near the Mississippi River to more than a mile high in the High Plains. The generally low relief of the plains is broken in several places, most notably in the Ozark and Ouachita Mountains, which form the U.S. Interior Highlands, the only major mountainous region between the Rocky Mountains and the Appalachian Mountains.[14][15]\n\n\nThe Great Plains come to an abrupt end at the Rocky Mountains. The Rocky Mountains form a large portion of the Western U.S., entering from Canada and stretching nearly to Mexico. The Rocky Mountain region is the highest region of the United States by average elevation. The Rocky Mountains generally contain fairly mild slopes and wider peaks compared to some of the other great mountain ranges, with a few exceptions, including the Teton Range in Wyoming and the Sawatch Range in Colorado. The highest peaks of the Rockies are found in Colorado, the tallest peak being Mount Elbert at 14,440 ft (4,400 m). Instead of being one generally continuous and solid mountain range, it is broken up into several smaller intermittent mountain ranges, forming a large series of basins and valleys.\n\n\nWest of the Rocky Mountains lies the Intermontane Plateaus, also known as the Intermountain West, a large, arid desert lying between the Rockies and the Cascades and Sierra Nevada ranges. The large southern portion, known as the Great Basin, consists of salt flats, drainage basins, and many small north–south mountain ranges. The Southwest is predominantly a low-lying desert region. A portion known as the Colorado Plateau, centered around the Four Corners region, is considered to have some of the most spectacular scenery in the world. It is accentuated in such national parks as Grand Canyon, Arches, Mesa Verde and Bryce Canyon, among others. Other smaller Intermontane areas include the Columbia Plateau, which covers eastern Washington state, western Idaho and northeast Oregon and the Snake River Plain in southern Idaho.\n\n\nThe Intermontane Plateaus come to an end at the Cascade Range and the Sierra Nevada. The Cascades consist of largely intermittent, volcanic mountains, many rising prominently from the surrounding landscape. The Sierra Nevada, further south, is a high, rugged, and dense mountain range. It contains the highest point in the contiguous 48 states, Mount Whitney (14,505 ft or 4,421 m). It is located at the boundary between California's Inyo and Tulare counties, just 84.6 mi or 136.2 km west-northwest of the lowest point in North America at the Badwater Basin in Death Valley National Park at 279 ft or 85 m below sea level.[16] These areas contain some spectacular scenery as well, as evidenced by such national parks as Yosemite and Mount Rainier. West of the Cascades and Sierra Nevada is a series of valleys, such as the Central Valley in California and the Willamette Valley in Oregon. Along the coast is a series of low mountain ranges known as the Pacific Coast Ranges.\n\n\nAlaska contains some of the most dramatic scenery in the country. Tall, prominent mountain ranges rise up sharply from broad, flat tundra plains. On the islands off the south and southwest coast are many volcanoes. Hawaii, far to the south of Alaska in the Pacific Ocean, is a chain of tropical, volcanic islands, popular as a tourist destination for many from East Asia and the mainland United States.\n\n\nThe territories of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands encompass a number of tropical isles in the northeastern Caribbean Sea. In the Pacific Ocean the territories of Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands occupy the limestone and volcanic isles of the Mariana archipelago, and American Samoa (the only populated US territory in the southern hemisphere) encompasses volcanic peaks and coral atolls in the eastern part of the Samoan Islands chain.[note 3]\n\n\nThe Atlantic coast of the United States is low, with minor exceptions. The Appalachian Highland owes its oblique northeast–southwest trend to crustal deformations which in very early geological time gave a beginning to what later came to be the Appalachian Mountain system. This system had its climax of deformation so long ago (probably in Permian time) that it has since then been very generally reduced to moderate or low relief. It owes its present-day altitude either to renewed elevations along the earlier lines or to the survival of the most resistant rocks as residual mountains. The oblique trend of this coast would be even more pronounced but for a comparatively modern crustal movement, causing a depression in the northeast resulting in an encroachment of the sea upon the land. Additionally, the southeastern section has undergone an elevation resulting in the advance of the land upon the sea.\n\n\nWhile the Atlantic coast is relatively low, the Pacific coast is, with few exceptions, hilly or mountainous. This coast has been defined chiefly by geologically recent crustal deformations, and hence still preserves a greater relief than that of the Atlantic. The low Atlantic coast and the hilly or mountainous Pacific coast foreshadow the leading features in the distribution of mountains within the United States.\n\n\nThe east coast Appalachian system, originally forest covered, is relatively low and narrow and is bordered on the southeast and south by an important coastal plain. The Cordilleran system on the western side of the continent is lofty, broad and complicated, having two branches, the Rocky Mountain System and the Pacific Mountain System. In between these mountain systems lie the Intermontane Plateaus. Both the Columbia River and Colorado River rise far inland near the easternmost members of the Cordilleran system, and flow through plateaus and intermontane basins to the ocean. Heavy forests cover the northwest coast, but elsewhere trees are found only on the higher ranges below the Alpine region. The intermontane valleys, plateaus and basins range from treeless to desert with the most arid region being in the southwest.\n\n\nThe Laurentian Highlands, the Interior Plains and the Interior Highlands lie between the two coasts, stretching from the Gulf of Mexico northward, far beyond the national boundary, to the Arctic Ocean. The central plains are divided by a hardly perceptible height of land into a Canadian and a United States portion. It is from the United States side that the great Mississippi system discharges southward to the Gulf of Mexico. The upper Mississippi and some of the Ohio basin is the semi-arid prairie region, with trees originally only along the watercourses. The uplands towards the Appalachians were included in the great eastern forested area, while the western part of the plains has an arid climate supporting only scanty native plant life, and in the south, it is practically barren.\n\n\nElevation extremes:\n\n\n\n* Lowest point: Death Valley, Inyo County, California −280 ft (−85.3 m)\n* Highest point: Denali, Denali Borough, Alaska 20,310 ft (6,190.5 m)\n\n\n## Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate of the United States\n\n![](image)The Köppen climate types of the United States, including the five inhabited U.S. territories)\n![](image)A map of average precipitation across the contiguous United States\nDue to its large size and wide range of geographic features, the United States contains examples of nearly every global climate. The climate is subtropical in the Southern United States, continental in the north, tropical in Hawaii and southern Florida, polar in Alaska, semiarid in the Great Plains west of the 100th meridian, Mediterranean in coastal California and arid in the Great Basin and the Southwest. Its comparatively favorable agricultural climate contributed (in part) to the country's rise as a world power, with infrequent severe drought in the major agricultural regions, a general lack of widespread flooding, and a mainly temperate climate that receives adequate precipitation.\n\n\nThe main influence on U.S. weather is the polar jet stream which migrates northward into Canada in the summer months, and then southward into the US in the winter months. The jet stream brings in large low-pressure systems from the northern Pacific Ocean that enters the US mainland over the Pacific Northwest. The Cascade Range, Sierra Nevada, and Rocky Mountains pick up most of the moisture from these systems as they move eastward via the orographic effect, and they are greatly diminished by the time they reach the High Plains.\n\n\nOnce they move over the Great Plains, uninterrupted flat land allows them to reorganize and can lead to major clashes of air masses. In addition, moisture from the Gulf of Mexico is often drawn northward. When combined with a powerful jet stream, this can lead to violent thunderstorms, especially during spring and summer. Sometimes during winter, these storms can combine with another low-pressure system as they move up the East Coast and into the Atlantic Ocean, where they intensify rapidly. \nThese storms are known as Nor'easters and often bring widespread, heavy rain, wind, and snowfall to New England. The uninterrupted grasslands of the Great Plains also lead to some of the most extreme climate swings in the world. Temperatures can rise or drop rapidly, winds can be extreme, and the flow of heat waves or Arctic air masses often advance uninterrupted through the plains.\n\n\nThe Great Basin and Columbia Plateau (the Intermontane Plateaus) are arid or semiarid regions that lie in the rain shadow of the Cascades and Sierra Nevada. Precipitation averages less than 15 inches (38 cm). The Southwest is a hot desert, with temperatures exceeding 100 °F (37.8 °C) for several weeks at a time in summer. The Southwest and the Great Basin are also affected by the monsoon from the Gulf of California from July to September, which brings localized but often severe thunderstorms to the region.\n\n\nMuch of California consists of a Mediterranean climate, with sometimes excessive rainfall from October–April and nearly no rain the rest of the year. In the Pacific Northwest rain falls year-round but is much heavier during winter and spring. The mountains of the west receive abundant precipitation and very heavy snowfall. The Cascades are one of the snowiest places in the world, with some places averaging over 600 inches (1,524 cm) of snow annually, but the lower elevations closer to the coast receive very little snow.\n\n\nFlorida has a subtropical climate in the northern part of the state and a tropical climate in the southern part of the state. Summers are wet and winters are dry in Florida. Annually, much of Florida and the deep southern states is frost-free. The mild winters of Florida allow a massive tropical fruit industry to thrive in the central part of the state, making the US second to only Brazil in citrus production worldwide.\n\n\nAnother significant (but localized) weather effect is lake-effect snow that falls south and east of the Great Lakes, especially in the hilly portions of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and on the Tug Hill Plateau in New York. The lake effect dumped well over 5 feet (1.52 m) of snow in the area of Buffalo, New York throughout the 2006–2007 winter. The Wasatch Front and Wasatch Range in Utah can also receive significant lake effect accumulations from the Great Salt Lake.\n\n\n\n### Extremes[edit]\n\n\nSee also: U.S. state temperature extremes\n\n![](image)Pago Pago Harbor in American Samoa has the highest annual rainfall of any harbor in the world.[17]\nIn northern Alaska, tundra and arctic conditions predominate, and the temperature has fallen as low as −80 °F (−62.2 °C).[18] On the other end of the spectrum, Death Valley, California once reached 134 °F (56.7 °C), the highest temperature ever recorded on Earth.[19][20]\n\n\nOn average, the mountains of the western states receive the highest levels of snowfall on Earth. The greatest annual snowfall level is at Mount Rainier in Washington, at 692 inches (1,758 cm); the record there was 1,122 inches (2,850 cm) in the winter of 1971–72. This record was broken by the Mt. Baker Ski Area in northwestern Washington which reported 1,140 inches (2,896 cm) of snowfall for the 1998–99 snowfall season. Other places with significant snowfall outside the Cascade Range are the Wasatch Mountains in Utah, the San Juan Mountains in Colorado, and the Sierra Nevada in California.\n\n\nIn the east, the region near the Great Lakes and the mountains of the Northeast receive the most snowfall, although they do not near snowfall levels in the western United States. Along the northwestern Pacific coast, rainfall is greater than anywhere else in the continental U.S., with Quinault Rainforest in Washington having an average of 137 inches (348 cm).[21] Hawaii receives even more, with 404 inches (1,026 cm) measured annually in the Big Bog, in Maui.[22] Pago Pago Harbor in American Samoa is the rainiest harbor in the world (because of the 523 meter Rainmaker Mountain).[17] The Mojave Desert, in the southwest, is home to the driest locale in the U.S. Yuma, Arizona, has an average of 2.63 inches (6.7 cm) of precipitation each year.[23]\n\n\nIn central portions of the U.S., tornadoes are more common than anywhere else on Earth[24] and touch down most commonly in the spring and summer. Deadly and destructive hurricanes occur almost every year along the Atlantic seaboard and the Gulf of Mexico. The Appalachian region and the Midwest experience the worst floods, though virtually no area in the U.S. is immune to flooding. The Southwest has the worst droughts; one is thought to have lasted over 500 years and to have hurt Ancestral Pueblo peoples.[25] The West is affected by large wildfires each year.\n\n\n\n## Natural disasters[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of natural disasters in the United States\n\n![](image)A powerful tornado near Dimmitt, Texas on June 2, 1995\nThe United States is affected by a variety of natural disasters yearly. Although drought is rare, it has occasionally caused major disruption, such as during the Dust Bowl (1931–1942). Farmland failed throughout the Plains, entire regions were substantially depopulated, and dust storms ravaged the land.\n\n\n\n### Tornadoes and hurricanes[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Tornadoes in the United States and Hurricanes in the United States\n\n![](image)Total devastation in Gulfport, Mississippi caused by storm surge from Hurricane Katrina in 2005\nAccording to a 2023 Gallup survey, around one in three Americans said that they directly experienced a severe weather condition over the previous two years.[26] The Great Plains and Midwest, due to the contrasting air masses, see frequent severe thunderstorms and tornado outbreaks during spring and summer with around 1,000 tornadoes occurring each year.[27] The strip of land from north Texas north to Kansas and Nebraska and east into Tennessee is known as Tornado Alley, where many houses have tornado shelters and many towns have tornado sirens, due to the very frequent tornado formation in the region.\n\n\nHurricanes are another natural disaster found in the US, which can hit anywhere along the Gulf Coast or the Atlantic Coast as well as Hawaii in the Pacific Ocean. Particularly at risk are the central and southern Texas coasts, the area from southeastern Louisiana east to the Florida Panhandle, peninsular Florida, and the Outer Banks of North Carolina, although any portion of the coast could be struck. The U.S. territories and possessions in the Caribbean, including Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, are also vulnerable to hurricanes due to their location in the Caribbean Sea.\n\n\nHurricane season runs from June 1 to November 30, with a peak from mid-August through early October. Some of the more devastating hurricanes have included the Galveston Hurricane of 1900, Hurricane Andrew in 1992, Hurricane Katrina in 2005, and Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Maria in 2017.\n\n\nHurricanes (known as cyclones in the Pacific Ocean) fail to make landfall on the Pacific Coast of the United States due to water temperatures being too cool to sustain them. However, the remnants of tropical cyclones from the Eastern Pacific occasionally impact the western United States, bringing moderate to heavy rainfall.\n\n\n\n### Flooding[edit]\n\n\nOccasional severe flooding is experienced in the United States. Significant floods throughout history include the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927, the Great Flood of 1993, and widespread flooding and mudslides caused by the 1982–83 El Niño event in the western United States. Flooding is still prevalent, mostly on the Eastern Coast, during hurricanes or other inclement weather, for example in 2012, when Hurricane Sandy devastated the region. Localized flooding can, however, occur anywhere, and mudslides from heavy rain can cause problems in any mountainous area, particularly the Southwest. Large stretches of desert shrub in the west can fuel the spread of wildfires. The narrow canyons of many mountain areas in the west and severe thunderstorm activity during the summer lead to flash floods as well, which can sometimes be devastating, while nor'easter snowstorms can bring activity to a halt throughout the Northeast (although heavy snowstorms can occur almost anywhere).\n\n\n\n### Geologic[edit]\n\n\nThe West Coast of the continental United States makes up part of the Pacific Ring of Fire, an area of heavy tectonic and volcanic activity that is the source of 90% of the world's earthquakes. [28] The American Northwest sees the highest concentration of active volcanoes in the United States, in Washington, Oregon and northern California along the Cascade Mountains. There are several active volcanoes located in the islands of Hawaii, including Kilauea in ongoing eruption since 1983, but they do not typically adversely affect the inhabitants of the islands. There has not been a major life-threatening eruption on the Hawaiian Islands since the 17th century. Volcanic eruptions can occasionally be devastating, such as in the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens in Washington.\n\n\nThe Ring of Fire makes California and southern Alaska particularly vulnerable to earthquakes. Earthquakes can cause extensive damage, such as the 1906 San Francisco earthquake or the 1964 Good Friday earthquake near Anchorage, Alaska. California is well known for seismic activity and requires large structures to be earthquake resistant to minimize loss of life and property.[29] Outside of devastating earthquakes, California experiences minor earthquakes on a regular basis.\n\n\nThere have been about 100 significant earthquakes annually from 2010 to 2012. Past averages were 21 a year. This is believed to be due to the deep disposal of wastewater from fracking. None have exceeded a magnitude of 5.6, and no one has been killed.[30]\n\n\n\n### Other natural disasters[edit]\n\n\nOther natural disasters include tsunamis around the Pacific Basin, mudslides in California, and forest fires in the western half of the contiguous U.S. Although drought is relatively rare, it has occasionally caused major economic and social disruption, such as during the Dust Bowl (1931–1942), which resulted in widespread crop failures and dust storms, beginning in the southern Great Plains and reaching to the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n\n\n### Consequences[edit]\n\n\nAccording to report by U.S. Census Bureau, in 2022 natural disasters led to the forced displacement of 3.3 million people, more than 1.3% of the U.S. adult population, with half of the displacements being caused by the hurricanes. The survey-report stated that in Florida, the devastation caused by Hurricanes Ian and Nicole resulted in the relocation of around 1 million people, or about one in every 17 adult residents. In Louisiana, where inhabitants were still dealing with the devastating results of Hurricane Ida the year before, more than 409,000 people, or almost one in every eight residents, were moved.

The northern border of the United States with Canada is the world's longest bi-national land border.\n\n\n\n\n## Area[edit]\n\n\nFrom 1989 through 1996, the total area of the US was listed as 9,372,610 km2 (3,618,780 sq mi) (land and inland water only). The listed total area changed to 9,629,091 km2 (3,717,813 sq mi) in 1997 (Great Lakes area and coastal waters added), to 9,631,418 km2 (3,718,711 sq mi) in 2004, to 9,631,420 km2 (3,718,710 sq mi) in 2006, and to 9,826,630 km2 (3,794,080 sq mi) in 2007 (territorial waters added). Currently, the CIA *World Factbook* gives 9,826,675 km2 (3,794,100 sq mi),[7] the United Nations Statistics Division gives 9,629,091 km2 (3,717,813 sq mi),[8] and the *Encyclopedia Britannica* gives 9,522,055 km2 (3,676,486 sq mi) (Great Lakes area included but not coastal waters).[9] These sources consider only the 50 states and the Federal District and exclude overseas territories. The US has the 2nd largest Exclusive Economic Zone of 11,351,000 km2 (4,383,000 sq mi).\n\n\nBy total area (water as well as land), the United States is either slightly larger or smaller than the People's Republic of China, making it the world's third or fourth-largest country. China and the United States are smaller than Russia and Canada in total area but are larger than Brazil. By land area only (exclusive of waters), the United States is the world's third largest country, after Russia and China, with Canada in fourth. Whether the US or China is the third largest country by total area depends on two factors: (1) the validity of China's claim on Aksai Chin and Trans-Karakoram Tract (both these territories are also claimed by India, so are not counted); and (2) how the US calculates its surface area. Since the initial publishing of the World Factbook, the CIA has updated the total area of the United States several times.[10]\n\n\n\n## General characteristics[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Borders of the United States\n\n![](image)A satellite image of the contiguous United States, where temperate and subtropical forests of deciduous, coniferous, broadleaved evergreen, mixed vegetation, grasslands, montane forests, and croplands prevail are prevalent in the east, transitioning to prairies, boreal forests, the Rockies in the west, and deserts in the southwest. Much of the country's population is centered around the Great Lakes and Atlantic states.\n![](image)A satellite image of Hawaii, where volcanoes prevail on the Big Island; the islands have rugged coastlines, sandy beaches, and a tropical environment, though temperatures and humidity tend to be less extreme because of nearly constant trade winds from the east.\nThe United States shares land borders with Canada to the north and Mexico to the south, a territorial water border with Russia in the northwest, and two territorial water borders in the southeast between Florida and Cuba, and Florida and the Bahamas. The contiguous 48 states are otherwise bounded by the Pacific Ocean on the west, the Atlantic Ocean on the east, and the Gulf of Mexico to the southeast. Alaska borders the Pacific Ocean to the south and southwest, the Bering Strait to the west, and the Arctic Ocean to the north; Hawaii lies far to the southwest of the mainland in the Pacific Ocean.\n\n\nForty-eight of the states are in the single region between Canada and Mexico. This group is referred to, with varying precision and formality, as the *contiguous United States*, and as the \"Lower 48\". Alaska, which is included in the term \"continental United States\", is located at the northwestern end of North America.\n\n\nThe nation's capital city, Washington, D.C., was established in 1800 after being relocated there from Philadelphia. It was established as a federal district located on land donated by the state of Maryland; Virginia also donated land, but it was returned in 1849. The United States also has overseas territories with varying levels of autonomy and organization, including the Caribbean territories of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, formerly known as the Danish Virgin Islands and purchased by the United States at the beginning of World War II, the Pacific territories of American Samoa, Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands, and several uninhabited island territories. Some of the territories acquired were part of the territorial evolution of the United States or a product of the nation's effort to gain access to the east.\n\n\nNearly all of the United States is in the Northern Hemisphere with the exception of American Samoa and Jarvis Island.[11]\n\n\n\n## Physiographic divisions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A physiographical map of the contiguous 48 states of the U.S. and indicating the age of the exposed surface and the type of terrain\n![](image)An aerial photo over northern Ohio; much of the central United States is covered by relatively flat, arable land.\nWithin the continental U.S. there are eight distinct physiographic divisions. [12] These major divisions are:\n\n\n\n* Laurentian Upland – part of the Canadian Shield that extends into the northern United States Great Lakes area.\n* Atlantic Plain – the coastal regions of the eastern and southern parts include the continental shelf, the Atlantic Coast and the Gulf Coast.\n* Appalachian Highlands – lying on the eastern side of the United States, it includes the Appalachian Mountains, the Watchung Mountains, the Adirondacks and New England province originally containing the Great Eastern Forest, a stretch of mixed temperature and subtropical montane forests, some of which are rainforests.\n* Interior Plains – part of the interior continental United States, it includes the Great Plains, as well as a number of highland and mountainous regions, like the Black Hills, dense cave systems, painted hills and badland features.\n* Interior Highlands – also part of the interior continental United States, this division includes the Ozark Plateau, the Ouachita Mountains, and other smaller mountain systems. This region is located largely in the warm temperate/subtropical moist and dry forest biomes.\n* Rocky Mountain System – one branch of the Cordilleran system lying far inland in the western states.\n* Intermontane Plateaus – also divided into the Columbia Plateau, the Colorado Plateau and the Basin and Range Province, it is a system of plateaus, basins, ranges and gorges between the Rocky and Pacific Mountain Systems. It is the setting for the Grand Canyon, the Great Basin and Death Valley.\n* Pacific Mountain System – the coastal mountain ranges and features in the west coast of the United States.\n\n\n![](image)Denali, also known as Mount McKinley, in Alaska, is the highest land-based mountain in the world, at 20,310 ft (6,190.5 m).\n![](image)The Grand Canyon, seen here from Moran Point, is among the most famous locations in the country.\nThe eastern United States has a varied topography. A broad, flat coastal plain lines the Atlantic and Gulf shores from the Texas-Mexico border to New York City, and includes the Florida peninsula. This broad coastal plain and barrier islands make up the widest and longest beaches in the United States, much of it composed of soft, white sands. The Florida Keys are a string of coral islands that reach the southernmost city on the United States mainland at Key West in South Florida. \n\n\nAreas further inland feature rolling hills, mountains, and a diverse collection of temperate and subtropical moist and wet forests. Parts of interior Florida and South Carolina are also home to sandhill communities. The Appalachian Mountains form a line of low mountains separating the eastern seaboard from the Great Lakes and the Mississippi basins. New England features rocky seacoasts and rugged mountains with peaks up to 6,200 feet and valleys dotted with rivers and streams. Offshore islands dot the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. A recent global remote sensing analysis suggested that there were 6,622 km² of tidal flats in the United States, making it the 4th ranked country in terms of tidal flat area.[13]\n\n\nThe five Great Lakes are located in the north-central portion of the country, four of them forming part of the border with Canada; only Lake Michigan is situated entirely within the United States. The southeast United States, generally stretching from the Ohio River southwards, includes a variety of warm temperate and subtropical moist and wet forests, as well as warm temperate and subtropical dry forests nearer the Great Plains in the west of the region. West of the Appalachians lies the lush Mississippi River basin and two large eastern tributaries, the Ohio River and the Tennessee River. The Ohio and Tennessee valleys and the Midwest consist largely of rolling hills, interior highlands and small mountains, jungle-like marsh and swampland near the Ohio River, and productive farmland, stretching south to the Gulf Coast. The Midwest also has a vast amount of cave systems.\n\n\nThe Great Plains lie west of the Mississippi River and east of the Rocky Mountains. A large portion of the country's agricultural products are grown in the Great Plains. Before their general conversion to farmland, the Great Plains were noted for their extensive grasslands, from tallgrass prairie in the eastern plains to shortgrass steppe in the western High Plains. Elevation rises gradually from less than a few hundred feet near the Mississippi River to more than a mile high in the High Plains. The generally low relief of the plains is broken in several places, most notably in the Ozark and Ouachita Mountains, which form the U.S. Interior Highlands, the only major mountainous region between the Rocky Mountains and the Appalachian Mountains.[14][15]\n\n\nThe Great Plains come to an abrupt end at the Rocky Mountains. The Rocky Mountains form a large portion of the Western U.S., entering from Canada and stretching nearly to Mexico. The Rocky Mountain region is the highest region of the United States by average elevation. The Rocky Mountains generally contain fairly mild slopes and wider peaks compared to some of the other great mountain ranges, with a few exceptions, including the Teton Range in Wyoming and the Sawatch Range in Colorado. The highest peaks of the Rockies are found in Colorado, the tallest peak being Mount Elbert at 14,440 ft (4,400 m). Instead of being one generally continuous and solid mountain range, it is broken up into several smaller intermittent mountain ranges, forming a large series of basins and valleys.\n\n\nWest of the Rocky Mountains lies the Intermontane Plateaus, also known as the Intermountain West, a large, arid desert lying between the Rockies and the Cascades and Sierra Nevada ranges. The large southern portion, known as the Great Basin, consists of salt flats, drainage basins, and many small north–south mountain ranges. The Southwest is predominantly a low-lying desert region. A portion known as the Colorado Plateau, centered around the Four Corners region, is considered to have some of the most spectacular scenery in the world. It is accentuated in such national parks as Grand Canyon, Arches, Mesa Verde and Bryce Canyon, among others. Other smaller Intermontane areas include the Columbia Plateau, which covers eastern Washington state, western Idaho and northeast Oregon and the Snake River Plain in southern Idaho.\n\n\nThe Intermontane Plateaus come to an end at the Cascade Range and the Sierra Nevada. The Cascades consist of largely intermittent, volcanic mountains, many rising prominently from the surrounding landscape. The Sierra Nevada, further south, is a high, rugged, and dense mountain range. It contains the highest point in the contiguous 48 states, Mount Whitney (14,505 ft or 4,421 m). It is located at the boundary between California's Inyo and Tulare counties, just 84.6 mi or 136.2 km west-northwest of the lowest point in North America at the Badwater Basin in Death Valley National Park at 279 ft or 85 m below sea level.[16] These areas contain some spectacular scenery as well, as evidenced by such national parks as Yosemite and Mount Rainier. West of the Cascades and Sierra Nevada is a series of valleys, such as the Central Valley in California and the Willamette Valley in Oregon. Along the coast is a series of low mountain ranges known as the Pacific Coast Ranges.\n\n\nAlaska contains some of the most dramatic scenery in the country. Tall, prominent mountain ranges rise up sharply from broad, flat tundra plains. On the islands off the south and southwest coast are many volcanoes. Hawaii, far to the south of Alaska in the Pacific Ocean, is a chain of tropical, volcanic islands, popular as a tourist destination for many from East Asia and the mainland United States.\n\n\nThe territories of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands encompass a number of tropical isles in the northeastern Caribbean Sea. In the Pacific Ocean the territories of Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands occupy the limestone and volcanic isles of the Mariana archipelago, and American Samoa (the only populated US territory in the southern hemisphere) encompasses volcanic peaks and coral atolls in the eastern part of the Samoan Islands chain.[note 3]\n\n\nThe Atlantic coast of the United States is low, with minor exceptions. The Appalachian Highland owes its oblique northeast–southwest trend to crustal deformations which in very early geological time gave a beginning to what later came to be the Appalachian Mountain system. This system had its climax of deformation so long ago (probably in Permian time) that it has since then been very generally reduced to moderate or low relief. It owes its present-day altitude either to renewed elevations along the earlier lines or to the survival of the most resistant rocks as residual mountains. The oblique trend of this coast would be even more pronounced but for a comparatively modern crustal movement, causing a depression in the northeast resulting in an encroachment of the sea upon the land. Additionally, the southeastern section has undergone an elevation resulting in the advance of the land upon the sea.\n\n\nWhile the Atlantic coast is relatively low, the Pacific coast is, with few exceptions, hilly or mountainous. This coast has been defined chiefly by geologically recent crustal deformations, and hence still preserves a greater relief than that of the Atlantic. The low Atlantic coast and the hilly or mountainous Pacific coast foreshadow the leading features in the distribution of mountains within the United States.\n\n\nThe east coast Appalachian system, originally forest covered, is relatively low and narrow and is bordered on the southeast and south by an important coastal plain. The Cordilleran system on the western side of the continent is lofty, broad and complicated, having two branches, the Rocky Mountain System and the Pacific Mountain System. In between these mountain systems lie the Intermontane Plateaus. Both the Columbia River and Colorado River rise far inland near the easternmost members of the Cordilleran system, and flow through plateaus and intermontane basins to the ocean. Heavy forests cover the northwest coast, but elsewhere trees are found only on the higher ranges below the Alpine region. The intermontane valleys, plateaus and basins range from treeless to desert with the most arid region being in the southwest.\n\n\nThe Laurentian Highlands, the Interior Plains and the Interior Highlands lie between the two coasts, stretching from the Gulf of Mexico northward, far beyond the national boundary, to the Arctic Ocean. The central plains are divided by a hardly perceptible height of land into a Canadian and a United States portion. It is from the United States side that the great Mississippi system discharges southward to the Gulf of Mexico. The upper Mississippi and some of the Ohio basin is the semi-arid prairie region, with trees originally only along the watercourses. The uplands towards the Appalachians were included in the great eastern forested area, while the western part of the plains has an arid climate supporting only scanty native plant life, and in the south, it is practically barren.\n\n\nElevation extremes:\n\n\n\n* Lowest point: Death Valley, Inyo County, California −280 ft (−85.3 m)\n* Highest point: Denali, Denali Borough, Alaska 20,310 ft (6,190.5 m)\n\n\n## Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate of the United States\n\n![](image)The Köppen climate types of the United States, including the five inhabited U.S. territories)\n![](image)A map of average precipitation across the contiguous United States\nDue to its large size and wide range of geographic features, the United States contains examples of nearly every global climate. The climate is subtropical in the Southern United States, continental in the north, tropical in Hawaii and southern Florida, polar in Alaska, semiarid in the Great Plains west of the 100th meridian, Mediterranean in coastal California and arid in the Great Basin and the Southwest. Its comparatively favorable agricultural climate contributed (in part) to the country's rise as a world power, with infrequent severe drought in the major agricultural regions, a general lack of widespread flooding, and a mainly temperate climate that receives adequate precipitation.\n\n\nThe main influence on U.S. weather is the polar jet stream which migrates northward into Canada in the summer months, and then southward into the US in the winter months. The jet stream brings in large low-pressure systems from the northern Pacific Ocean that enters the US mainland over the Pacific Northwest. The Cascade Range, Sierra Nevada, and Rocky Mountains pick up most of the moisture from these systems as they move eastward via the orographic effect, and they are greatly diminished by the time they reach the High Plains.\n\n\nOnce they move over the Great Plains, uninterrupted flat land allows them to reorganize and can lead to major clashes of air masses. In addition, moisture from the Gulf of Mexico is often drawn northward. When combined with a powerful jet stream, this can lead to violent thunderstorms, especially during spring and summer. Sometimes during winter, these storms can combine with another low-pressure system as they move up the East Coast and into the Atlantic Ocean, where they intensify rapidly. \nThese storms are known as Nor'easters and often bring widespread, heavy rain, wind, and snowfall to New England. The uninterrupted grasslands of the Great Plains also lead to some of the most extreme climate swings in the world. Temperatures can rise or drop rapidly, winds can be extreme, and the flow of heat waves or Arctic air masses often advance uninterrupted through the plains.\n\n\nThe Great Basin and Columbia Plateau (the Intermontane Plateaus) are arid or semiarid regions that lie in the rain shadow of the Cascades and Sierra Nevada. Precipitation averages less than 15 inches (38 cm). The Southwest is a hot desert, with temperatures exceeding 100 °F (37.8 °C) for several weeks at a time in summer. The Southwest and the Great Basin are also affected by the monsoon from the Gulf of California from July to September, which brings localized but often severe thunderstorms to the region.\n\n\nMuch of California consists of a Mediterranean climate, with sometimes excessive rainfall from October–April and nearly no rain the rest of the year. In the Pacific Northwest rain falls year-round but is much heavier during winter and spring. The mountains of the west receive abundant precipitation and very heavy snowfall. The Cascades are one of the snowiest places in the world, with some places averaging over 600 inches (1,524 cm) of snow annually, but the lower elevations closer to the coast receive very little snow.\n\n\nFlorida has a subtropical climate in the northern part of the state and a tropical climate in the southern part of the state. Summers are wet and winters are dry in Florida. Annually, much of Florida and the deep southern states is frost-free. The mild winters of Florida allow a massive tropical fruit industry to thrive in the central part of the state, making the US second to only Brazil in citrus production worldwide.\n\n\nAnother significant (but localized) weather effect is lake-effect snow that falls south and east of the Great Lakes, especially in the hilly portions of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and on the Tug Hill Plateau in New York. The lake effect dumped well over 5 feet (1.52 m) of snow in the area of Buffalo, New York throughout the 2006–2007 winter. The Wasatch Front and Wasatch Range in Utah can also receive significant lake effect accumulations from the Great Salt Lake.\n\n\n\n### Extremes[edit]\n\n\nSee also: U.S. state temperature extremes\n\n![](image)Pago Pago Harbor in American Samoa has the highest annual rainfall of any harbor in the world.[17]\nIn northern Alaska, tundra and arctic conditions predominate, and the temperature has fallen as low as −80 °F (−62.2 °C).[18] On the other end of the spectrum, Death Valley, California once reached 134 °F (56.7 °C), the highest temperature ever recorded on Earth.[19][20]\n\n\nOn average, the mountains of the western states receive the highest levels of snowfall on Earth. The greatest annual snowfall level is at Mount Rainier in Washington, at 692 inches (1,758 cm); the record there was 1,122 inches (2,850 cm) in the winter of 1971–72. This record was broken by the Mt. Baker Ski Area in northwestern Washington which reported 1,140 inches (2,896 cm) of snowfall for the 1998–99 snowfall season. Other places with significant snowfall outside the Cascade Range are the Wasatch Mountains in Utah, the San Juan Mountains in Colorado, and the Sierra Nevada in California.\n\n\nIn the east, the region near the Great Lakes and the mountains of the Northeast receive the most snowfall, although they do not near snowfall levels in the western United States. Along the northwestern Pacific coast, rainfall is greater than anywhere else in the continental U.S., with Quinault Rainforest in Washington having an average of 137 inches (348 cm).[21] Hawaii receives even more, with 404 inches (1,026 cm) measured annually in the Big Bog, in Maui.[22] Pago Pago Harbor in American Samoa is the rainiest harbor in the world (because of the 523 meter Rainmaker Mountain).[17] The Mojave Desert, in the southwest, is home to the driest locale in the U.S. Yuma, Arizona, has an average of 2.63 inches (6.7 cm) of precipitation each year.[23]\n\n\nIn central portions of the U.S., tornadoes are more common than anywhere else on Earth[24] and touch down most commonly in the spring and summer. Deadly and destructive hurricanes occur almost every year along the Atlantic seaboard and the Gulf of Mexico. The Appalachian region and the Midwest experience the worst floods, though virtually no area in the U.S. is immune to flooding. The Southwest has the worst droughts; one is thought to have lasted over 500 years and to have hurt Ancestral Pueblo peoples.[25] The West is affected by large wildfires each year.\n\n\n\n## Natural disasters[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of natural disasters in the United States\n\n![](image)A powerful tornado near Dimmitt, Texas on June 2, 1995\nThe United States is affected by a variety of natural disasters yearly. Although drought is rare, it has occasionally caused major disruption, such as during the Dust Bowl (1931–1942). Farmland failed throughout the Plains, entire regions were substantially depopulated, and dust storms ravaged the land.\n\n\n\n### Tornadoes and hurricanes[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Tornadoes in the United States and Hurricanes in the United States\n\n![](image)Total devastation in Gulfport, Mississippi caused by storm surge from Hurricane Katrina in 2005\nAccording to a 2023 Gallup survey, around one in three Americans said that they directly experienced a severe weather condition over the previous two years.[26] The Great Plains and Midwest, due to the contrasting air masses, see frequent severe thunderstorms and tornado outbreaks during spring and summer with around 1,000 tornadoes occurring each year.[27] The strip of land from north Texas north to Kansas and Nebraska and east into Tennessee is known as Tornado Alley, where many houses have tornado shelters and many towns have tornado sirens, due to the very frequent tornado formation in the region.\n\n\nHurricanes are another natural disaster found in the US, which can hit anywhere along the Gulf Coast or the Atlantic Coast as well as Hawaii in the Pacific Ocean. Particularly at risk are the central and southern Texas coasts, the area from southeastern Louisiana east to the Florida Panhandle, peninsular Florida, and the Outer Banks of North Carolina, although any portion of the coast could be struck. The U.S. territories and possessions in the Caribbean, including Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, are also vulnerable to hurricanes due to their location in the Caribbean Sea.\n\n\nHurricane season runs from June 1 to November 30, with a peak from mid-August through early October. Some of the more devastating hurricanes have included the Galveston Hurricane of 1900, Hurricane Andrew in 1992, Hurricane Katrina in 2005, and Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Maria in 2017.\n\n\nHurricanes (known as cyclones in the Pacific Ocean) fail to make landfall on the Pacific Coast of the United States due to water temperatures being too cool to sustain them. However, the remnants of tropical cyclones from the Eastern Pacific occasionally impact the western United States, bringing moderate to heavy rainfall.\n\n\n\n### Flooding[edit]\n\n\nOccasional severe flooding is experienced in the United States. Significant floods throughout history include the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927, the Great Flood of 1993, and widespread flooding and mudslides caused by the 1982–83 El Niño event in the western United States. Flooding is still prevalent, mostly on the Eastern Coast, during hurricanes or other inclement weather, for example in 2012, when Hurricane Sandy devastated the region. Localized flooding can, however, occur anywhere, and mudslides from heavy rain can cause problems in any mountainous area, particularly the Southwest. Large stretches of desert shrub in the west can fuel the spread of wildfires. The narrow canyons of many mountain areas in the west and severe thunderstorm activity during the summer lead to flash floods as well, which can sometimes be devastating, while nor'easter snowstorms can bring activity to a halt throughout the Northeast (although heavy snowstorms can occur almost anywhere).\n\n\n\n### Geologic[edit]\n\n\nThe West Coast of the continental United States makes up part of the Pacific Ring of Fire, an area of heavy tectonic and volcanic activity that is the source of 90% of the world's earthquakes. [28] The American Northwest sees the highest concentration of active volcanoes in the United States, in Washington, Oregon and northern California along the Cascade Mountains. There are several active volcanoes located in the islands of Hawaii, including Kilauea in ongoing eruption since 1983, but they do not typically adversely affect the inhabitants of the islands. There has not been a major life-threatening eruption on the Hawaiian Islands since the 17th century. Volcanic eruptions can occasionally be devastating, such as in the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens in Washington.\n\n\nThe Ring of Fire makes California and southern Alaska particularly vulnerable to earthquakes. Earthquakes can cause extensive damage, such as the 1906 San Francisco earthquake or the 1964 Good Friday earthquake near Anchorage, Alaska. California is well known for seismic activity and requires large structures to be earthquake resistant to minimize loss of life and property.[29] Outside of devastating earthquakes, California experiences minor earthquakes on a regular basis.\n\n\nThere have been about 100 significant earthquakes annually from 2010 to 2012. Past averages were 21 a year. This is believed to be due to the deep disposal of wastewater from fracking. None have exceeded a magnitude of 5.6, and no one has been killed.[30]\n\n\n\n### Other natural disasters[edit]\n\n\nOther natural disasters include tsunamis around the Pacific Basin, mudslides in California, and forest fires in the western half of the contiguous U.S. Although drought is relatively rare, it has occasionally caused major economic and social disruption, such as during the Dust Bowl (1931–1942), which resulted in widespread crop failures and dust storms, beginning in the southern Great Plains and reaching to the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n\n\n### Consequences[edit]\n\n\nAccording to report by U.S. Census Bureau, in 2022 natural disasters led to the forced displacement of 3.3 million people, more than 1.3% of the U.S. adult population, with half of the displacements being caused by the hurricanes. The survey-report stated that in Florida, the devastation caused by Hurricanes Ian and Nicole resulted in the relocation of around 1 million people, or about one in every 17 adult residents. In Louisiana, where inhabitants were still dealing with the devastating results of Hurricane Ida the year before, more than 409,000 people, or almost one in every eight residents, were moved.
