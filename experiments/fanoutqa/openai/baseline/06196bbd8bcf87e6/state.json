Timbaland and Tweet performed \"The Rain (Supa Dupa Fly)\", Eve and Keyshia Cole performed \"Hot Boyz\" and \"Work It\", Fatman Scoop and Ciara performed \"Lose Control\", and Nelly Furtado performed \"Get Ur Freak On (The Remix)\".[53] Since 2007, Elliott's seventh studio album has had several different forms with extensive delays. In 2007, she worked with Timbaland, Swizz Beatz, Danja, T-Pain and DJ Toomp and planned to release an album at the beginning of 2008.[54] In January 2008, \"Ching-a-Ling\" was released as the lead single for the *Step Up 2: The Streets* soundtrack, which also featured \"Shake Your Pom Pom\" produced by Timbaland. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nA year after Elliott's most successful album to date was released, Elliott felt pressured by her label to release another album hoping to capitalize on her recent success.[49] Elliott's singles, \"Pass That Dutch\" and \"I'm Really Hot\", from her fifth album, *This Is Not a Test!* (released November 2003), both rose the urban charts. However, both were not as successful at pop radio in comparison to many of her previous efforts. *This Is Not A Test* sold 690,000 copies in the United States[49] and has been certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Elliott has since stated that \"the album *This Is Not A Test* came out extremely too quickly for me. I didn't want it to come out when it did.\"[50] In 2004, Elliott was featured on Ciara's hit single \"1, 2 Step\", with her verse interpolating Teena Marie's single, \"Square Biz\". Elliott premiered her own reality show on the UPN Network, *The Road to Stardom with Missy Elliott* in 2005 even though it was not renewed for a second season. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nMTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year\n |\n| --- |\n| 1980s | * \"You Might Think\"\u00a0\u2013 The Cars (1984)\n* \"The Boys of Summer\"\u00a0\u2013 Don Henley (1985)\n* \"Money for Nothing\"\u00a0\u2013 Dire Straits (1986)\n* \"Sledgehammer\"\u00a0\u2013 Peter Gabriel (1987)\n* \"Need You Tonight\" / \"Mediate\"\u00a0\u2013 INXS (1988)\n* \"This Note's for You\"\u00a0\u2013 Neil Young (1989)\n |\n| 1990s | * \"Nothing Compares 2 U\"\u00a0\u2013 Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor (1990)\n* \"Losing My Religion\"\u00a0\u2013 R.E.M.

She is the daughter of Rita Lamae (n\u00e9e Bray; d. 2018),[5] a teacher at Irvington High School (Dana's alma mater), and Lancelot Amos Owens, a police officer.[6][7][8] Her parents divorced when she was ten.[9]\n\n\nShe was raised in the Baptist faith.[10] She attended Catholic school in Newark, New Jersey[11][12] and Essex Catholic Girls' High School in Irvington but graduated from Irvington High School.[13][14][9] After high school, she attended classes at Borough of Manhattan Community College.[15]\n\n\nShe found her stage name, *Latifah* (\u0644\u0637\u064a\u0641\u0629 *la\u0163\u012bfa*), meaning \"delicate\" and \"very kind\" in Arabic, in a book of Arabic names when she was eight.[9] Always tall, the 5-foot-10-inch (1.78\u00a0m) Dana was a power forward on her high school basketball team.[16][17] She performed the number \"Home\" from the musical *The Wiz* in a grammar school play.[18]\n\n\n\n## Music career[edit]\n\n\n### 1988\u20131989: Career beginnings[edit]\n\n\nShe began beat boxing for the hip-hop group Ladies Fresh and was an original member of the Flavor Unit, which, at that time, was a crew of MCs grouped around producer DJ King Gemini, who made a demo recording of Queen Latifah's rap Princess of the Posse. He gave the recording to Fab 5 Freddy, the host of *Yo! MTV Raps*. The song got the attention of Tommy Boy Music employee Dante Ross, who signed Latifah and in 1989 released her first single, \"Wrath of My Madness\". More recent artists, like Ice Cube and Lil' Kim, would go on to sample Latifah's track in their songs, \"Wrath of Kim's Madness\" and \"You Can't Play With My Yo-Yo\" in later years. Latifah has a two-octave vocal range.[19] She is considered a contralto, having the ability to both rap and sing.[19]\n\n\n\n### 1989\u20132002: Rap and hip-hop[edit]\n\n\nLatifah made her mark in hip-hop by rapping about the issues surrounding a black woman. Her songs had covered topics including domestic violence, harassment on the streets, and relationship problems.[20]\nFreddy helped Latifah sign with Tommy Boy Records, which released Latifah's first album *All Hail the Queen* in 1989, when she was nineteen.[9] That year, she appeared as Referee on the UK label Music of Life album *1989\u00a0\u2013 The Hustlers Convention (live)*. She received a Candace Award from the National Coalition of 100 Black Women in 1992.[21] The single \"Ladies First\" featuring Monie Love became the first collaborative track by two female rappers not in a group.[22] In 1993, she released the album *Black Reign*, which was certified Gold in the United States[23] and produced the Grammy Award-winning song \"U.N.I.T.Y.\" In 1998, co-produced by Ro Smith, now CEO of Def Ro Inc., she released her fourth hip-hop album *Order in the Court*, which was released by Motown Records. Latifah was also a member of the hip-hop collective Native Tongues.\n\n\nLatifah performed in the Super Bowl XXXII halftime show, making her the first rapper to do so.[24]\n\n\n\n### 2003\u20132009: Change to traditional singing[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Queen Latifah hosts LEAGUE National Awards and Recognition Luncheon 2008\nAfter *Order in the Court*, Latifah shifted primarily to singing soul music and jazz standards, which she had used sparingly in her previous hip-hop-oriented records. In 2004, she released the soul/jazz standards *The Dana Owens Album*. On July 11, 2007, Latifah sang at the famed Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles as the headlining act in a live jazz concert. In front of a crowd of more than 12,400, she was backed by a 10-piece live orchestra and three backup vocalists, which was billed as the Queen Latifah Orchestra. Latifah performed new arrangements of standards including \"California Dreaming\", first made popular by 1960s icons the Mamas & the Papas. Later in 2007, Latifah released an album titled *Trav'lin' Light*. Jill Scott, Erykah Badu, Joe Sample, George Duke, Christian McBride, and Stevie Wonder made guest appearances.[25] The album was nominated for a Grammy in the \"Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album\" category.[26]\n\n\nIn 2009, Latifah, along with the NJPAC Jubilation Choir,[27] recorded the title track on the album *Oh, Happy Day: An All-Star Music Celebration*, covering the song that the Edwin Hawkins Singers made popular in 1969.[28]\n\n\n\n### 2008\u2013present: Return to hip-hop[edit]\n\n\nIn 2008, Latifah was asked if she would make another hip-hop album. She was quoted stating that the album was done already and it would be called *All Hail the Queen II*. The following year, in 2009, she released her album *Persona*. The song \"Cue the Rain\" was released as the album's lead single.[29] 2011 saw Queen Latifah sing \"Who Can I Turn To\" in a duet with Tony Bennett for his album *Duets II*.[30] In January 2012, while appearing on *106 & Park* with Dolly Parton, to promote *Joyful Noise*, Latifah stated that she had been working on a new album.\n\n\n\n## Film and television[edit]\n\n\n### 1991\u20132001: Early career[edit]\n\n\nShe began her film career by having supporting roles in the 1991 and 1992 films *House Party 2*, *Juice* and *Jungle Fever*. Moreover, she has guest starred in two episodes during the second season (1991\u20131992) of the NBC hit *The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air* and had a guest role as herself on a tv sitcom *Hangin' with Mr. Cooper* in 1993.

She possesses a two-octave vocal range. Queen Latifah is a contralto, and she has the ability to rap and sing. Her biggest musical influences are EPMD, KRS-One, LL Cool J, Public Enemy, and Run\u2013D.M.C.[48] She also cites Bessie Smith as one of her influences.[49]\n\n\n*Al Hail the Queen* features hip-hop, reggae, soulful back-up vocals, boppish scatting, snappy horn back-ups, and house music. She described the work as \"a creative outlet... and sometimes it can become like a newspaper that people read with their ears.\"[50]\n\n\nEarly in her career, Queen Latifah's lyrics were described as woman-centered and Afrocentric. The rapper often used Afrocentric attires during public appearances and music videos, looks that became her trademark.[51] In 1990, *The New York Times*' Michelle Wallace described her art as \"politically sophisticated\", which \"seems worlds apart from the adolescent, buffoonish sex orientation of most rap.\"[52] For *AllMusic*, her \"strong, intelligent, no-nonsense\" persona made her \"arguably the first MC who could properly be described as feminist\".[2] Queen Latifah did not identify as a feminist at the time, and expressed that her music was not exclusive for the female audience.[53] On the topic, author Tricia Rose wrote that Black female rappers likely did not identify with feminism during that time because it was perceived as a movement that focused primarily on white women's issues.[54]\n\n\n\n## Products and endorsements[edit]\n\n\nLatifah is a celebrity spokesperson for CoverGirl cosmetics, Curvation women's underwear, Pizza Hut, and Jenny Craig.[55] She represents her own line of cosmetics for women of color called the CoverGirl Queen Collection.[56] Latifah has also launched a perfume line called \"Queen\" and \"Queen of Hearts\". On May 23, 2018, Latifah was named the godmother of Carnival Cruise Lines' vessel Carnival Horizon. Apart from singing, Queen Latifah has written a book on confidence and self-respect called *Ladies First: Revelations of a Strong Woman.*[57]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nRaised in East Orange, New Jersey, Latifah has been a resident of Colts Neck, New Jersey; Rumson, New Jersey; and Beverly Hills, California.[58]\n\n\nLatifah's older brother, Lancelot Jr., was killed in 1992 in an accident involving a motorcycle that Latifah had purchased for him.[9] A 2006 interview revealed that Latifah still wears the key to the motorcycle around her neck,[9] visible throughout her performance in her sitcom *Living Single*. In 1995, Latifah was the victim of a carjacking, which also resulted in the shooting of her boyfriend, Sean Moon.[59]\n\n\nIn 1996, she was arrested and charged with possession of marijuana and possession of a loaded handgun.[60] In 2002, she was arrested for driving under the influence in Los Angeles County.[61] She was placed on three years' probation after being convicted.[62]\n\n\nOn March 21, 2018, her mother, actress Rita Owens, died due to heart failure, an issue she had been battling since 2004.[63]\n\n\nLatifah long refused to address speculation around her sexuality and personal life, telling *The New York Times* in 2008 that \"I don't feel like I need to share my personal life, and I don't care if people think I'm gay or not\".[64] At the BET Awards 2021, during her acceptance speech for the Lifetime Achievement Award, she publicly acknowledged her partner Eboni Nichols and son Rebel for the first time, ending the speech with \"happy Pride!\"[65]\n\n\nIn the January 2020 season 6, episode 4 of *Finding Your Roots* titled \"This Land Is My Land\", Latifah learned that her family were descended from a line of freed Negroes, since her ancestors were listed by name in the U.S. pre\u2013Civil War census of 1860 in Virginia.[66] Slaves were almost never listed by name in pre\u2013U.S. Civil War censuses. Latifah also learned the exact date her ancestors became free which was October 1, 1792, the date her second earliest known ancestor, a woman named \"Jug\" or Juggy Owens, was emancipated from slavery.[67]\n\n\n\n### Feud with Foxy Brown[edit]\n\n\nDisagreements between Foxy Brown and Queen Latifah began in mid-1996, where media reports indicated that Brown was a prime target of Latifah's diss record \"Name Callin'\", which was featured on the *Set It Off* soundtrack.[68] In response, Brown made allegations of Latifah \"checking her out\" at musical events and further questioned Latifah's sexuality in various public radio interviews. In 1998, Brown released a diss record titled \"10% Dis\", where she continually questioned Latifah's sexuality and accused her of being jealous.[69][70]\n\n\nBy late spring of 1998, Latifah responded to Brown through another diss record titled \"Name Callin' Part II\".[71][72] On the record, Latifah disses Brown about her heavy reliance on sex appeal, in which she implies that Brown has to rely on skimpy outfits to hide her \"half-assed flow\".[71][73] Foxy Brown retaliated via a response-diss record titled \"Talk to Me\", in which Brown made fun of the ratings of Latifah's television talk show and went on to make various homophobic remarks to both Latifah and then-newcomer Queen Pen.[74]\n\n\nA significant part of media dubbed Latifah \"the winner\" of the feud.[72] Hip-hop magazine *Ego Trip* stated that Latifah won the feud with her diss record \"Name Callin' Part II\" and added that she showed that \"the lady's still first\", in reference to Latifah's 1990 single, \"Ladies First\".[72] In 2000, Brown and Latifah reconciled; to prove that the truce was real, Brown performed her song \"Na Na Be Like\" on *The Queen Latifah Show*.[75]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nOften cited as one of the best female rappers,[76] Queen Latifah achieved groundbreaking success[77] in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and became what *Pitchfork* considered as the \"most recognizable female rapper\" of the golden era of hip hop.[78] *AllMusic* writer Steve Huey stated that Latifah was \"certainly not the first female rapper, but she was the first one to become a bona fide star.\"[2] In the book *Notable Black American Women*, Jessie Carney Smith hailed her as \"rap's first feminist\" and \"one of the few women to make a mark in the male-dominated field of rap music\".[79] *Variety* called her \"one of the major forerunners for women in modern hip-hop,\"[80] and *The Guardian* referred to her as a \"pioneer of female rap\".[81]\n\n\nThroughout her career, several media publications have referred to her as the \"Queen of Rap\"[50][82][83] including *New York* magazine (1990) via editor Dinitia Smith,[79] as well as \"Queen of Hip Hop\".[82][81][84][51] Latifah became the first solo female rapper to receive a RIAA certification for an album (*Black Reign*), a commercial breakthrough that the *AllMusic* editor considered as creating a path for \"a talented crew of women rappers to make their own way onto the charts as the 90s progressed\".[2] Her breakthrough also helped place New Jersey on the hip hop map.[51] In 1998, she performed in the Super Bowl XXXII halftime show, making her the first rapper to do so.[24]\n\n\nAccording to an *African American Review* journal, her afrocentric feminist music video for \"Ladies First\" presented a \"televisual moment\" and disrupted the continuity of sexism and racism that dominated the music videos at the time.[85] The song was listed on the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll,[86] and was one of the firsts texts to address the declining standards of male-female relationships in community life.[54] Author Tricia Rose expressed that it \"offered hip-hop for the development of pro-female pro-black diasporas political consciousness.\"[54] In *Consequence*, Okla Jones noted that the song \"U.N.I.T.Y.\"\u2014which lyrics confront slurs against women in hip-hop culture and address other types of disrespect\u2014created a path for future female rappers to be \"their authentic selves\".[87]\n\n\n\n### Acting[edit]\n\n\n*Vibe* magazine has noted her as the first female rapper to cross over into TV & film,[88] as an artist that \"broke barriers and set standards\" for Black women in music to follow, and cited her as the \"First Lady of Hip-Hop\".[22] For her performance as Matron \"Mama\" Morton in *Chicago*, Latifah earned a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, becoming the first woman in hip hop to earn an Oscar nomination.[89]\n\n\n\n### Cultural impact[edit]\n\n\nQueen Latifah has been cited as an influence on R&B, soul, and hip-hop artists, such as Eve,[90] Da Brat,[91] Lil' Kim,[92] Fugees,[93] Jill Scott,[94] Lauryn Hill,[95] Missy Elliott,[96] Remy Ma,[97] Ivy Queen,[98] Foxy Brown,[99] Ms. Dynamite,[100] Naughty by Nature,[101] Rapsody,[102] Megan Thee Stallion,[103] as well as actors Michael K. Williams,[104] Keke Palmer,[105] Vin Diesel,[106] and author Jason Reynolds.[107]\n\n\nPlaywright Lin-Manuel Miranda has stated that Latifah inspired the portrayal of Angelica Schuyler in the musical *Hamilton*.[108] In 2020, *Vogue* editor Janelle Okwodu considered her a fashion icon that \"helped to start a conversation about body image that continues to this day\", crediting her among the first artists that pioneered the \"climate of size inclusivity and muses of all shapes\".[109]\n\n\n\n## Accolades[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of awards and nominations received by Queen Latifah\n\nQueen Latifah became the first female hip-hop recording artist to get nominated for an Oscar. In 2003, Queen Latifah was awarded Artist of the Year by Harvard Foundation.[110] In 2006, Latifah became the first hip-hop artist to receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame,[111] and was also inducted into the New Jersey Hall of Fame in 2011.[112] In her music career, Queen Latifah has sold nearly 2 million albums in the US.[113][114] *The Root* ranked her at number 35 on *The Root* 100 list.[115] In 2017, American Black Film Festival honored Latifah with the Entertainment Icon award.[116] In 2018, she received an honorary Doctor of Fine Arts Degree by the Rutgers University.[117] In 2019, Harvard University awarded the W. E. B. Du Bois Medal to Queen Latifah for cultural contributions.[118] In 2023, Queen Latifah's debut album *All Hail the Queen,* was added into the Library of Congress's National Recording Registry, making it the earliest female rap recording to enter the National Recording Registry,[119] and made her the second female hip-hop recording artist to have her music included after Lauryn Hill;[120][121] however some outlets incorrectly reported her as the first to accomplish the feat.[122][123]\n\n\nShe is a recipient of a Grammy Award from six nominations, a Golden Globe Award, two Screen Actors Guild Awards from five nominations, two NAACP Image Awards from thirteen nominations, one Primetime Emmy Award from three nominations, and an Academy Award nomination. In 2021, she received the BET Lifetime Achievement Award and was the first rapper female or male to be awarded.[124]\n\n\n\n## Discography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Queen Latifah discography\n\n**Studio albums**\n\n\n\n* *All Hail the Queen* (1989)\n* *Nature of a Sista'* (1991)\n* *Black Reign* (1993)\n* *Order in the Court* (1998)\n* *The Dana Owens Album* (2004)\n* *Trav'lin' Light* (2007)\n* *Persona* (2009)\n\n\n## Tours[edit]\n\n\nLatifah, Jill Scott and Erykah Badu joined to create and own the rights to the Sugar Water Festival Tour, LLC.
