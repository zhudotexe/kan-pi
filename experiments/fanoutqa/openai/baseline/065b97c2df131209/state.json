Since joining the Steelers in 2007, he has led the team to ten playoff runs, seven division titles, three AFC Championship Games, two Super Bowl appearances, and a title in Super Bowl XLIII. At age 36, Tomlin became the youngest head coach to win the Super Bowl, a record which was later beaten by Sean McVay in Super Bowl LVI. He has never had a losing season.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nTomlin was born in Hampton, Virginia,[1] the younger of two sons; his brother, Eddie, is three and a half years older. Their father, Ed Tomlin, played football at Hampton Institute in the 1960s, was drafted by the Baltimore Colts, and later played for the Montreal Alouettes in the Canadian Football League. The elder Tomlin died in January 2012 from an apparent heart attack in Ocala, Florida, at the age of 63. However, Tomlin hardly knew his birth father and was raised by his mother and stepfather, Julia and Leslie Copeland, who married when Tomlin was six years old.\n\n\nTomlin graduated in 1990 from Denbigh High School in Newport News, Virginia. He graduated from the College of William and Mary with a sociology degree in 1995,[2] becoming a member of Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity. As a wide receiver, Tomlin was a second-team All-Yankee Conference selection in 1994.\n\n\n\n## Coaching career[edit]\n\n\n### College football[edit]\n\n\nTomlin's coaching career began in 1995 as the wide receiver coach at Virginia Military Institute under head coach Bill Stewart. Tomlin spent the 1996 season as a graduate assistant at the University of Memphis, where he worked with the defensive backs and special teams. Following a brief stint on the University of Tennessee at Martin's coaching staff, Tomlin was hired by Arkansas State University in 1997 to coach its defensive backs. He stayed there for two seasons, before being hired as defensive backs coach by the University of Cincinnati.\n\n\n\n### National Football League[edit]\n\n\n#### Positions coach[edit]\n\n\nTomlin was hired as the defensive backs coach for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2001 under head coach Tony Dungy, where he first learned the Tampa 2 defense that he would use in later coaching jobs.[3]\n\n\nTomlin was retained under new head coach Jon Gruden, and in 2002 and 2005, the Buccaneers led the NFL in total defense (fewest yards allowed per game). During Tomlin's tenure, the defense never ranked worse than sixth overall. When the Buccaneers won Super Bowl XXXVII in January 2003, the team recorded a Super Bowl-record five interceptions, three of which were returned for touchdowns.[4]\n\n\n\n#### Defensive coordinator[edit]\n\n\nTomlin was selected by Vikings' head coach Brad Childress to be his defensive coordinator in 2006.[5][6]\n\n\nTwo of the players on the Vikings roster were older than Tomlin, and Tomlin had been a teammate of Vikings' safety Darren Sharper while at William and Mary. The 2006 Vikings finished with the NFL's eighth-best overall defense, but had the unusual distinction of finishing as the top-ranked defense against the run[7] and the worst-ranked defense against the pass.[8]\n\n\n\n#### Head coach[edit]\n\n\nAfter spending 2006 as the Vikings' defensive coordinator, Tomlin was selected to interview for the vacant head coaching position with the 2005 Super Bowl Champion Pittsburgh Steelers. With only a year of experience as a defensive coordinator, Tomlin was hired on January 27, 2007, to become the 16th head coach in franchise history, replacing Bill Cowher, who retired after spending 15 years with the team. Tomlin had also interviewed for the head coaching vacancy with the Miami Dolphins, a job that eventually went to former Indiana head coach Cam Cameron.\n\n\nWith Tomlin, the Steelers continued a trend of hiring head coaches in their 30s. The others were Cowher (age 34 in 1992), Chuck Noll (38 in 1969), Bill Austin (38 in 1966), John Michelosen (32 in 1948), Jim Leonard (35 in 1945), Aldo Donelli (33 in 1941), Walt Kiesling (35 in 1939), Johnny \"Blood\" McNally (33 in 1937), and Joe Bach (34 in 1935).[*citation needed*]\n\n\nTomlin is the 10th African-American head coach in NFL history and the first for the Steelers franchise. Steelers owner Dan Rooney has served as the head of the NFL's diversity committee and proposed the Rooney Rule, requiring that teams interview at least one minority candidate when hiring a new head coach. Although Tomlin's ascension to an NFL head coaching job has been cited as evidence of the rule working as intended,[9] Rooney himself disputed this, as he had already interviewed a minority candidate prior to interviewing Tomlin.[10]\n\n\n\n\n> \n> The Rooney Rule dictates that for all head-coaching openings, each team must interview at least one minority candidate. But here's what's interesting: The coach who might be the Rooney Rule's greatest advertisement didn't benefit from it. \"Let me say this: Mike Tomlin was not part of the Rooney Rule,\" Rooney said. \"We had already interviewed Ron Rivera [then the Bears' defensive coordinator], and so that fulfilled the obligation,\" Rooney said. \"We went on, had heard about Mike, called him in and talked to him. He was very impressive.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\nTerms of Tomlin's contract were not officially released. The *Pittsburgh Post-Gazette* reported a four-year deal paying $2.5 million per year, with an option for a fifth year. He is the team's third consecutive head coach to win his first game, and the first in team history to win his first game against the rival Cleveland Browns.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn contrast to Bill Cowher, who retained only longtime running backs coach Dick Hoak from Chuck Noll's staff (Hoak himself retired just before Cowher's resignation), Tomlin did retain many of Cowher's assistants, most notably defensive coordinator Dick LeBeau, whose defensive philosophy contrasted with Tomlin's. This was done in order to keep team chemistry with the players, since the team was only one year removed from a Super Bowl win at the time of Tomlin's hiring. The Steelers finished Tomlin's first season as head coach with the top-ranked defense in the NFL.[11] Tomlin led the Steelers to the 2007 AFC North Division championship and a 10\u20136 record in his first year as head coach.[12] The Steelers lost in the first round of the playoffs to the Jacksonville Jaguars, 31\u201329. Tomlin began his career with a 15\u20137 record in regular season play\u2014as did his predecessor Cowher and all-time win-leader Don Shula.[13] Tomlin set a Steelers record for most wins, after winning 22\u00a0games in his first two seasons as head coach; in addition he became the first Steelers coach to win division titles in his first two seasons.[14]\n\n\nWhen the Steelers defeated the Baltimore Ravens in the 2008 AFC Championship Game,[15] Tomlin became the youngest NFL head coach to lead his team to a Super Bowl.[16] He also became the third African-American to coach a team to the Super Bowl, following Chicago's Lovie Smith and Indianapolis's Tony Dungy, the two opposing coaches in Super Bowl XLI. After only two seasons, with a record of 22\u201310, Tomlin was the winningest head coach in Steelers history based on win percentage (68.8%).[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n![](image)Tomlin in the victory parade after winning Super Bowl XLIII\nOn January 29, 2009, Tomlin was named the 2008 Motorola NFL Coach of the Year.[17] Three days later, at age 36, he became the youngest head coach to win the Super Bowl when the Steelers defeated the Arizona Cardinals in Super Bowl XLIII by a score of 27\u201323.[18] The previous record was held by Jon Gruden, who was 39 when he won Super Bowl XXXVII with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Coincidentally, Tomlin was the defensive backs coach under Gruden when the Buccaneers won the Super Bowl and was a key component in their success that year.[19] Tomlin's record was eclipsed by Sean McVay who was 303 days younger when winning Super Bowl LVI.[20]\n\n\nFollowing their Super Bowl-winning season, Tomlin and the Steelers recorded a 9\u20137 record in the 2009 season, missing the playoffs.[21][22]\n\n\nOn July 13, 2010, Tomlin signed a three-year contract extension with the Steelers.[23] That season, he coached the Steelers to a 12\u20134 record and led them to the Super Bowl for the second time in three years.[24] In Super Bowl XLV, the Steelers lost to the Green Bay Packers by a score of 31\u201325.[25]\n\n\nOn November 13, 2011, Tomlin won his 50th game as the Steelers' head coach with a 24\u201317 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals. Of the Steelers' 16 head coaches in franchise history, he was the fourth to reach this milestone. On July 24, 2012, Tomlin received a three-year contract extension through the 2016 season.[26] The financial terms were not disclosed. The Steelers recorded another 12\u20134 regular season mark in the 2011 season.[27] The Steelers' season ended in the Wild Card Round with a 29\u201323 overtime loss to the Denver Broncos.[28]\n\n\nIn the 2012 season, the Steelers finished with an 8\u20138 record after struggling with injuries to quarterback Ben Roethlisberger and the offensive line and adjusting to the system of new offensive coordinator Todd Haley.[29][30] It was the second time the Steelers failed to make the playoffs under Tomlin's tenure as head coach.\n\n\nFacing the Baltimore Ravens on November 28, 2013, in a primetime Thanksgiving Day game with major playoff implications, Tomlin became the subject of controversy when video replay showed him interfering with a kick return. With the Steelers trailing 13\u20137 in the third quarter, Tomlin stood just off the field along the visiting team's sideline as Baltimore's Jacoby Jones broke free on a kickoff return for a potential game-breaking touchdown.[31] Tomlin, with his back to the approaching play, appeared to glance over his shoulder then place his foot briefly onto the field as he jumped out of the way, causing Jones to veer inside where he was tackled. Several Ravens players claimed Tomlin had intentionally interfered with Jones; if officials had agreed, a touchdown could have been awarded to the Ravens based on the palpably unfair act. However, no penalty was called for interference or for standing in the white border area reserved for the officiating crew. Whether it was intentional or not, Tomlin was widely criticized in the media. Following the game, Tomlin defended himself, stating he had simply wandered too close to the field while watching the play on the stadium's Jumbotron, a mistake he said coaches often make.[32] The league subsequently announced it was investigating the matter, with the potential of a heavy fine and forfeited draft picks.[31] On December 4, 2013, the NFL announced that they had fined Tomlin $100,000, and hinted it was considering stripping the Steelers of one or more draft picks because his actions affected the play on the field.[33] The $100,000 fine was tied for the second-highest for a coach in NFL history and was also tied for the highest for a coach who does not also have the powers of general manager. Then-Minnesota Vikings head coach Mike Tice was fined $100,000 in 2005 for scalping Super Bowl tickets.[34] Tomlin led the team to another 8\u20138 record in the 2013 season, missing the postseason.[35]\n\n\nTomlin led the Steelers to improvement in the 2014 season, going 11\u20135 and winning the AFC North.[36] The team saw their season end in the Wild Card Round to the Baltimore Ravens in a 30\u201317 loss.[37]\n\n\nIn the 2015 season, Tomlin and the Steelers recorded a 10\u20136 mark, which qualified the team for the postseason.[38] The Steelers defeated the Cincinnati Bengals 18\u201316 in the Wild Card Round before falling to the Denver Broncos 23\u201316 in the Divisional Round.[39][40]\n\n\nThe 2016 season marked significant improvement for the Steelers. Tomlin led the team to a 11\u20135 record and AFC North title.[41] The Steelers defeated the Miami Dolphins 30\u201312 in the Wild Card Round and the Kansas City Chiefs 18\u201316 in the Divisional Round.[42][43] In the Steelers' first AFC Championship Game since the 2010 season, they fell to the New England Patriots 36\u201317.[44]\n\n\nTomlin and the Steelers went 13\u20133 and won the AFC North in the 2017 season.[45] Despite the successful regular season, the team went one-and-done in the playoffs, losing 45\u201342 to the Jacksonville Jaguars in the Divisional Round.[46]\n\n\nTomlin led the Steelers to a 9\u20136\u20131 mark in the 2018 season, missing the playoffs.[47]\n\n\nIn 2019, Tomlin lost his starting quarterback, Ben Roethlisberger, after a narrow Week 2 28\u201326 loss to the Seattle Seahawks.[48] Although the Steelers had started the season 0\u20133, they got their first win in a Week 4 27\u20133 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals on *Monday Night Football*.[49] The Steelers did lose the following week to the division-winning Baltimore Ravens in a 26\u201323 overtime loss. After the 1\u20134 start, the Steelers would go on a winning streak winning their next four games straight going 5\u20134. After then losing a game on the road to the Cleveland Browns by a score of 21\u201314, the Steelers won three more straight and were 8\u20135 and fighting for a playoff spot with the loss of Roethlisberger and multiple injuries on the offense. The Steelers would lose their final three games and finish the season with an 8\u20138 record in spite of multiple quarterback changes and an 0\u20133 start.[50]\n\n\nAt the end of the 2020 season, Tomlin was tied with Pete Carroll for 21st place on the NFL's all-time regular-season wins list with 145.\n\n\nTomlin was fined US$100,000 by the NFL for not properly wearing a face mask, as required for coaches during the COVID-19 pandemic, during a Week 8 game in the 2020 NFL season on November 6, 2020.[51] After Week 9 of the 2020 season, Tomlin recorded his 14th consecutive non-losing season since becoming a head coach, tying him with Marty Schottenheimer for the longest streak of all time.[52] The Steelers finished the 2020 season with a 12\u20134 record but lost in the Wild Card Round of the playoffs to the Cleveland Browns.[53] Tomlin announced that he tested positive for COVID-19 after the season on February 22, 2021.[54]\n\n\nOn April 20, 2021, Tomlin signed a three-year contract extension to remain the Steelers' head coach through 2024.[55] Tomlin led the Steelers to a 9\u20137\u20131 mark in the 2021 season.[56] The Steelers made the playoffs but saw their season end in the Wild Card Round to the Kansas City Chiefs in a 42\u201321 loss.[57] The 2022 season was Tomlin\u2019s 16th with the team, passing predecessor Bill Cowher for the second-longest tenure as head coach of the Steelers.[58] December 11, 2022 marked the 32nd matchup between Tomlin and Baltimore Ravens head coach John Harbaugh, surpassing Curly Lambeau and Steve Owen for the second-most head-to-head matchups between head coaches in NFL history (the current record is held by Lambeau and George Halas with 49).[59] Tomlin coached the Steelers to a 9\u20138 record in 2022, missing the playoffs.[60]\n\n\n\n## Head coaching record[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Team | Year | Regular season | Postseason\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Won | Lost | Ties | Win\u00a0% | Finish | Won | Lost | Win\u00a0% | Result\n |\n| PIT | 2007 | 10 | 6 | 0 | .625 | **1st in AFC North** | 0 | 1 | .000 | **Lost to Jacksonville Jaguars in AFC Wild Card Game** |\n| PIT | 2008 | 12 | 4 | 0 | .750 | **1st in AFC North** | 3 | 0 | 1.000 | **Super Bowl XLIII champions** |\n| PIT | 2009 | 9 | 7 | 0 | .563 | 3rd in AFC North | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014\n |\n| PIT | 2010 | 12 | 4 | 0 | .750 | **1st in AFC North** | 2 | 1 | .667 | **Lost to Green Bay Packers in Super Bowl XLV** |\n| PIT | 2011 | 12 | 4 | 0 | .750 | **2nd in AFC North** | 0 | 1 | .000 | **Lost to Denver Broncos in AFC Wild Card Game** |\n| PIT | 2012 | 8 | 8 | 0 | .500 | 3rd in AFC North | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014\n |\n| PIT | 2013 | 8 | 8 | 0 | .500 | 2nd in AFC North | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014\n |\n| PIT | 2014 | 11 | 5 | 0 | .688 | **1st in AFC North** | 0 | 1 | .000 | **Lost to Baltimore Ravens in AFC Wild Card Game** |\n| PIT | 2015 | 10 | 6 | 0 | .625 | **2nd in AFC North** | 1 | 1 | .500 | **Lost to Denver Broncos in AFC Divisional Game** |\n| PIT | 2016 | 11 | 5 | 0 | .688 | **1st in AFC North** | 2 | 1 | .667 | **Lost to New England Patriots in AFC Championship Game** |\n| PIT | 2017 | 13 | 3 | 0 | .813 | **1st in AFC North** | 0 | 1 | .000 | **Lost to Jacksonville Jaguars in AFC Divisional\nGame** |\n| PIT | 2018 | 9 | 6 | 1 | .594 | 2nd in AFC North | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014\n |\n| PIT | 2019 | 8 | 8 | 0 | .500 | 2nd in AFC North | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014\n |\n| PIT | 2020 | 12 | 4 | 0 | .750 | **1st in AFC North** | 0 | 1 | .000 | **Lost to Cleveland Browns in AFC Wild Card\nGame** |\n| PIT | 2021 | 9 | 7 | 1 | .559 | **2nd in AFC North** | 0 | 1 | .000 | **Lost to Kansas City Chiefs in AFC Wild Card\nGame** |\n| PIT | 2022 | 9 | 8 | 0 | .529 | 3rd in AFC North | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014\n |\n| PIT | 2023 | 6\n | 3\n | 0\n | .571\n | TBD in AFC North\n | \u2014\n | \u2014\n | \u2014\n | \u2014\n |\n| Total | 169 | 95 | 2 | .636 |  | 8 | 9 | .471 |  |\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nTomlin met his wife while they were students at The College of William & Mary.

Widely regarded as one of the greatest head coaches of all time,[2][3][4] he holds numerous coaching records, including the record of most Super Bowl wins (six) as a head coach, all with the Patriots, along with two more during his time as the defensive coordinator of the New York Giants, for the record of eight combined total Super Bowl victories as coach and coordinator.[5] Belichick is often referred to as a \"student of the game\", with a deep knowledge of the intricacies of each player position, and is known as a renowned American football historian.[6][7][8][9] Under his tenure with the Patriots, he was a central figure as the head coach as well as the chief executive during the franchise's dynasty from 2001 to 2019.[10]\n\n\nBelichick is a descendant of the Bill Parcells coaching tree. He began his coaching career in 1975 as an assistant for the Baltimore Colts, and became the defensive coordinator for New York Giants head coach Bill Parcells by 1985. Parcells and Belichick won two Super Bowls together before Belichick left to become the head coach of the Cleveland Browns in 1991. He remained in Cleveland for five seasons but was fired following the team's 1995 season. He rejoined Parcells, first in New England where the team lost Super Bowl XXXI, and later with the New York Jets.\n\n\nAfter being named head coach of the Jets, Belichick resigned after only one day on the job to accept the head coaching job for the New England Patriots on January 27, 2000. Since then, he has led the Patriots to 17 AFC East division titles, 13 appearances in the AFC Championship Game, and nine Super Bowl appearances, with a record six wins. Overall, Belichick has won eight Super Bowl titles (the most of any individual in NFL history) and finished as runner-up four times from his combined time as an assistant and head coach.\n\n\nBelichick is the NFL's longest-tenured active head coach, as well as the first all-time in playoff coaching wins with 31 and third in regular season coaching wins in the NFL with 298.[11] In addition, Belichick is second place for combined regular season and postseason wins, and also second place for most regular season coaching wins with one franchise.[12] He is one of only three head coaches who have won six NFL titles.[13] He was named the AP NFL Coach of the Year for the 2003, 2007, and 2010 seasons. Belichick has also been selected to the NFL 2000s All-Decade Team, NFL 2010s All-Decade Team, as well as the NFL 100th Anniversary All-Time Team, and is the only active head coach on the latter team.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nBelichick was born on April 16, 1952, in Nashville[14] the son of Jeannette (Munn) and Steve Belichick (born Stephen Bili\u010di\u0107).[15] Bill was named after College Football Hall of Fame coach Bill Edwards, who was his godfather.[16] Belichick is of Croatian ancestry[17] and his paternal grandparents, Ivan Bili\u010di\u0107 and Marija (Mary) Barkovi\u0107, emigrated from the Croatian village of Dragani\u0107, Karlovac, in 1897, settling in Monessen, Pennsylvania.[18]\n\n\nHe was raised in Annapolis, Maryland[19] where his father was an assistant football coach at the United States Naval Academy. Belichick has said his father is one of his most important football mentors, and Belichick often studied football with him.[20] Bill reportedly learned to break down game films at a young age by watching his father and the Navy staff do their jobs.[21] He graduated from Annapolis High School in 1970 with classmate Sally Brice-O'Hara.[22][23] While there he played football and lacrosse, with the latter being his favorite sport.[24] He enrolled at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, for a postgraduate year, with the intention of improving his grades and test scores to be admitted into a quality college.[25] The school honored him 40 years later by inducting him into its Athletics Hall of Honor in 2011.[26]\n\n\nBelichick attended Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut where he played center and tight end. In addition to being a member of the football team, he played lacrosse and squash, serving as the captain of the lacrosse team during his senior season. A member of Chi Psi fraternity,[27] he earned a bachelor's degree in economics in 1975.[28] Eventually he was part of the inaugural induction class into the university's Athletics Hall of Fame in spring 2008.[29]\n\n\n\n## Coaching career[edit]\n\n\n### Early coaching positions[edit]\n\n\nAfter graduating, Belichick took a $25-per-week job as an assistant to Baltimore Colts head coach Ted Marchibroda in 1975.[30] In 1976, he joined the Detroit Lions as their assistant special teams coach before adding tight ends and wide receivers to his coaching duties in 1977.[31] He was dismissed along with head coach Tommy Hudspeth and the rest of the coaching staff on January 9, 1978.[32] He spent the 1978 season with the Denver Broncos as their assistant special teams coach and defensive assistant.[33]\n\n\n\n### New York Giants (1979\u20131990)[edit]\n\n\nIn 1979, Belichick began a 12-year stint with the New York Giants alongside head coach Ray Perkins as a defensive assistant and special teams coach.[34] He added linebackers coaching to his duties in 1980 and was named defensive coordinator in 1985 under head coach Bill Parcells, who had replaced Perkins in 1983. The Giants won Super Bowl XXI and Super Bowl XXV following the 1986 and 1990 seasons.[35][36] His defensive game plan from the New York Giants' 20\u201319 upset of the Buffalo Bills in Super Bowl XXV has been placed in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.[37]\n\n\n\n### Cleveland Browns (1991\u20131995)[edit]\n\n\nFrom 1991 until 1995, Belichick was the head coach of the Cleveland Browns. During his tenure in Cleveland, he compiled a 36\u201344 record, leading the team to the playoffs in 1994, his only winning year with the team.[38] Coincidentally, his one playoff victory during his Browns tenure was achieved against the New England Patriots, who were coached by former Giants head coach Bill Parcells, in the Wild Card Round during that postseason.[39] In Belichick's last season in Cleveland, the Browns finished 5\u201311, despite starting 3\u20131.[40] One of his most controversial moves was cutting quarterback Bernie Kosar midway through the 1993 season. Kosar was signed by the Dallas Cowboys two days later and won a Super Bowl with the Cowboys in Super Bowl XXVIII as a backup. In November 1995, in the middle of the ongoing football season, Browns owner Art Modell had announced he would move his franchise to Baltimore after the season.[41] After first being given assurances that he would coach the new team that would later become the Baltimore Ravens, Belichick was instead fired on February 14, 1996, one week after the shift was officially announced.[42]\n\n\n\n### New England Patriots (1996)[edit]\n\n\nAfter his dismissal by the Cleveland Browns, Belichick served under Parcells again as assistant head coach and defensive backs coach with the Patriots for the 1996 season. The Patriots finished with an 11\u20135 record and won the AFC Championship over the Jacksonville Jaguars, but they lost to the Green Bay Packers in Super Bowl XXXI amid rumors of Parcells's impending defection.[43][44]\n\n\n\n### New York Jets (1997\u20131999)[edit]\n\n\nBelichick had two stints as the head coach of the New York Jets without ever coaching a game.\n\n\nIn February 1997, Belichick, who had been an assistant coach under Bill Parcells with the New York Giants and New England Patriots, was named the Jets interim head coach while the Jets and Patriots continued to negotiate compensation to release Parcells from his contract with the Patriots and allow Parcells to coach the Jets.[45] Six days later the Patriots and Jets reached an agreement that allowed Parcells to coach the Jets, and Belichick became the team's assistant head coach and defensive coordinator.[46]\n\n\nWhen Parcells stepped down as head coach after the 1999 season, he had already arranged with team management to have Belichick succeed him. However, Belichick was the New York Jets' head coach for only one day. On January 4, 2000, when Belichick was introduced as head coach to the media\u2014the day after his hiring was publicized\u2014he turned it into a surprise resignation announcement. Before taking the podium, he scrawled a resignation note on a napkin that read, in its entirety, *\"I resign as HC of the NYJ.\"* He then delivered a half-hour speech explaining his resignation to the assembled press corps.[47]\n\n\nSoon after this bizarre turn of events, he was introduced as the Patriots' 12th full-time head coach, succeeding the recently fired Pete Carroll.[48] The Patriots had inquired to the Jets about permission to interview him for their vacant spot at head coach just prior to Parcells stepping down.[49] Parcells and the Jets claimed that Belichick was still under contract to the Jets, and demanded compensation from the Patriots. NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue agreed, and the Patriots gave the Jets a first-round draft pick in 2000 in exchange for the right to hire Belichick.[50]\n\n\n\n### New England Patriots (2000\u2013present)[edit]\n\n\nSoon after hiring Belichick, owner Robert Kraft gave him near-complete control over the team's football operations, making him the *de facto* general manager as well. Until 2009, Belichick split many of the duties normally held by a general manager on other clubs with player personnel director Scott Pioli, though Belichick had the final say on football matters.[51] Pioli left for the Kansas City Chiefs after the 2008 season.[52]\n\n\nThe Patriots went 5\u201311 in the 2000 regular season and missed the playoffs.[53]\n\n\n\n#### Starting Brady over Bledsoe, \"Patriot Way\", first three Super Bowl wins: 2001\u20132004[edit]\n\n\nIn 2001, the Patriots went 11\u20135 in the regular season, and defeated the Oakland Raiders (in the \"Tuck Rule Game\") and Pittsburgh Steelers on the way to the Super Bowl.[54][55] In Super Bowl XXXVI, Belichick's defense held the St. Louis Rams' offense, which had averaged 31 points during the season, to 17 points, and the Patriots won on a last-second field goal by Adam Vinatieri.[56] The win was the first Super Bowl championship in Patriots history.[57]\n\n\nThe following season (2002)\u2014the first in Gillette Stadium\u2014the Patriots went 9\u20137 and missed the playoffs.[58] New England finished with the same record as the New York Jets and the Miami Dolphins, but the Jets won the AFC East title as a result of the third tiebreaker (record among common opponents).[59]\n\n\n\n![](image)Belichick (right) at the Patriots' visit to the White House in 2004\nThe Patriots' 2003 season started with a 31\u20130 loss to the Buffalo Bills in Week 1, a few days after they released team defensive captain Lawyer Milloy.[60][61] However, they dominated through the remainder of the season to finish 14\u20132, setting a new franchise record for wins in a season.[62] In the final week of the regular season, the Patriots avenged their loss to the Bills by the same 31\u20130 score.[63] They defeated the Tennessee Titans in the Divisional Round. Playing against the Indianapolis Colts and Co-MVP Peyton Manning in the AFC Championship (Steve McNair of the Titans was also Co-MVP), the Patriots recorded four interceptions, and advanced to Super Bowl XXXVIII, where they defeated the Carolina Panthers 32\u201329 on a late Adam Vinatieri field goal.[64][65] Belichick was awarded the NFL Coach of the Year Award.\n\n\nIn 2004, the Patriots once again finished with a 14\u20132 record, and they defeated the Indianapolis Colts in the Divisional Round.[66][67] They opened the season at 6\u20130, which combined with the 15 straight wins to end the previous season, gave New England 21 consecutive victories to break the record for most wins in a row formerly held by the Miami Dolphins with 18 straight victories in the 1972 and 1973 seasons. They defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers in the AFC Championship. In Super Bowl XXXIX, the Patriots beat the Philadelphia Eagles and became only the second team to win three Super Bowls in four years.[68][69] Belichick is the only coach to accomplish the feat as the Dallas Cowboys had two head coaches in the stretch they won three of four from 1992 to 1995.\n\n\n\n#### The perfect season, Randy Moss, the Manning brothers, and Brady's injury: 2005\u20132009[edit]\n\n\nWith a new defensive coordinator in Eric Mangini and no named offensive coordinator, the Patriots went 10\u20136 in the 2005 season and defeated the Jacksonville Jaguars in the Wild Card Round before losing to the Denver Broncos in the Divisional Round.[70][71][72] Earlier, with a season-opening win over the Oakland Raiders, Belichick notched his 54th win with the Patriots, passing Mike Holovak as the winningest coach in Patriots history.\n\n\nThe Patriots finished with a 12\u20134 record in the 2006 season and defeated the New York Jets by a score of 37\u201316 in the Wild Card Round.[73][74] They then beat the San Diego Chargers the next week in the Divisional Round, before losing to the eventual Super Bowl XLI winner Indianapolis Colts in the AFC Championship by a score of 38\u201334.[75][76] The Patriots led 21\u20133 mid-way during the second quarter, but the Colts mounted one of the great comebacks in playoff history.[77]\n\n\n\n![](image)Belichick during an August 28, 2009, preseason game against the Washington Redskins\nIn 2007, Belichick led the Patriots to the first perfect regular season since the introduction of the 16-game regular season schedule in 1978, only the fourth team to do so in National Football League history after the 1934[78] and 1942 Chicago Bears[79] and 1972 Miami Dolphins. In the Divisional Round of the playoffs, they defeated the Jacksonville Jaguars by a score of 31\u201320. In the AFC Championship, the Patriots defeated the San Diego Chargers by a score of 21\u201312. The Patriots were upset in Super Bowl XLII by the New York Giants, his former team, due to the defense allowing a famous play to David Tyree near the end of regulation[80] The Patriots' failure to attain a \"perfect season\" (undefeated and untied, including playoffs) preserved the Miami Dolphins as the sole team to do so, having finished their 1972 regular season at 14\u20130 and having won three games in the playoffs. Only two other teams in professional football have recorded a perfect season\u2014the 1948 Cleveland Browns (14\u20130) of the then All-America Football Conference and the 1948 Calgary Stampeders (12\u20130) of the Canadian Football League. No team in the former American Football League had a perfect season.\n\n\nIn the Patriots' 2008 season-opener against the Kansas City Chiefs, quarterback Tom Brady sustained a season-ending injury in the first quarter.[81] Backup quarterback Matt Cassel was named the starter for the remainder of the season. However, with a win in Week 2, the Patriots broke their own record for regular season wins in a row with 21 (2006\u201308). After losing over a dozen players to the injured reserve list, including Rodney Harrison, Adalius Thomas, and Laurence Maroney, the Patriots still managed their league-leading eighth consecutive season with a winning record, going 11\u20135.[82] Nevertheless, the Patriots, who finished second in the AFC East, missed the playoffs for the first time since 2002, losing on tiebreakers to the Miami Dolphins (who won the division on the fourth tiebreaker, better conference record) and the Baltimore Ravens (who beat out the Patriots for the last playoff spot due to a better conference record).[83] The 1985 Denver Broncos are the only other 11-win team to miss the playoffs in a 16-game season.[84]\n\n\nIn 2009, with a fully healthy Tom Brady back as the starting quarterback, Belichick was able to guide the Patriots to yet another AFC East division title with a 10\u20136 record.[85] However, the Patriots lost to the Baltimore Ravens in the Wild Card Round.[86]\n\n\n\n#### Spygate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Spygate (NFL)\n\nIn an incident dubbed \"Spygate,\"[87] on September 9, 2007, NFL security caught a Patriots video assistant taping the New York Jets' defensive signals from the sidelines, which is not an approved location. The NFL rules state \"No video recording devices of any kind are permitted to be in use in the coaches' booth, on the field, or in the locker room during the game.\" Jets coach Eric Mangini, a former Patriots assistant, tipped off league officials that the Patriots might have been filming their signals. After the game, the Jets formally complained to the league.\n\n\nOn September 13, the NFL fined Belichick $500,000\u2014the largest fine ever imposed on a coach in the league's 87-year history,[88] and fined the Patriots $250,000. Additionally, the Patriots forfeited their first-round draft pick in the 2008 NFL Draft. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, a former employee of the Jets, said that he fined the Patriots as a team because Belichick exercises so much control over the Patriots' on-field operations that \"his actions and decisions are properly attributed to the club.\" Goodell considered suspending Belichick, but decided that taking away draft picks would be more severe in the long run.[89] Gary Myers, *New York Daily News* columnist, stated Belichick should have been suspended by Goodell for the Patriots' next game against the Jets.[90]\n\n\nBelichick later issued the following statement:\n\n\n\n\n> I accept full responsibility for the actions that led to tonight's ruling. Once again, I apologize to the Kraft family and every person directly or indirectly associated with the New England Patriots for the embarrassment, distraction and penalty my mistake caused. I also apologize to Patriots fans and would like to thank them for their support during the past few days and throughout my career. [...] As the Commissioner acknowledged, our use of sideline video had no impact on the outcome of last week's game. We have never used sideline video to obtain a competitive advantage while the game was in progress. [...] Part of my job as head coach is to ensure that our football operations are conducted in compliance of the league rules and all accepted interpretations of them. My interpretation of a rule in the Constitution and Bylaws was incorrect. [...] With tonight's resolution, I will not be offering any further comments on this matter. We are moving on with our preparations for Sunday's game.\n> \n> \n\n\nThe sanctions against Belichick were the harshest imposed on a head coach in league history until the New Orleans Saints' Sean Payton was suspended for the entire 2012 season for covering up a scheme in which bounties were paid for deliberately knocking opponents out of games.\n\n\nFollowing the incident and its fallout, Belichick led the Patriots to a perfect 16\u20130 regular season record, and was awarded the 2007 NFL Coach of the Year Award, as voted on by the Associated Press.[91]\n\n\n\n#### Making five Super Bowls and winning three, Gronkowski, and \"We're on to Cincinnati\": 2010\u20132019[edit]\n\n\nIn the 2010 season, Belichick and the Patriots finished with a 14\u20132 record for the top seed in the AFC.[92] However, their postseason ended quickly with a 28\u201321 loss to the New York Jets in the divisional round.[93]\n\n\nIn the 2011 season, the Patriots topped the AFC with a 13\u20133 record.[94] Following a victory over the Denver Broncos in the divisional round, the Patriots won the AFC Championship game, beating the Baltimore Ravens 23\u201320 when the Ravens failed to score a touchdown and Baltimore's kicker, Billy Cundiff, missed a routine 32-yard field goal attempt to tie the game and send it into overtime.[95][96] This sent New England to their fifth Super Bowl under Belichick. In Super Bowl XLVI, the Patriots lost in the Super Bowl XLII rematch to the New York Giants by a score of 21\u201317.[97]\n\n\n\n![](image)Belichick at the 2012 Time 100 gala\nOn September 26, 2012, following a 31\u201330 loss to the Baltimore Ravens, Belichick was fined $50,000 for grabbing a replacement official's arm while asking for more specific clarity on a ruling after Baltimore had narrowly converted a last-second field goal attempt to secure the win.[98] The Patriots finished the 2012 regular season with a 12\u20134 record. In the divisional round of the playoffs, they defeated the Houston Texans by a score of 41\u201328 and made it to the AFC Championship Game, where they lost to the eventual Super Bowl XLVII champion Baltimore Ravens by a score of 28\u201313, ending their season.[99][100]\n\n\nBelichick's Patriots began the 2013 season with much upheaval on the offensive side of the ball with the injury of Rob Gronkowski, the arrest and subsequent release of Aaron Hernandez, the departures of Wes Welker to the Denver Broncos and Danny Woodhead to the San Diego Chargers in free agency, and the release of Brandon Lloyd. To replace them, the Patriots signed Danny Amendola in free agency, drafted rookies Aaron Dobson and Josh Boyce, and signed undrafted rookie free agent Kenbrell Thompkins. The team ended the season with a 12\u20134 record, winning the AFC East and securing a playoff berth and a first-round bye, seeding second in the AFC standings.[101] In the divisional round, they defeated the Indianapolis Colts by a score of 43\u201322.[102] They lost to the Denver Broncos in the AFC Championship Game by a score of 26\u201316.[103]\n\n\nIn the 2014 season, Belichick's Patriots started 2\u20132. At a mid-week press conference following a 41\u201314 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs, Belichick famously uttered \"We're on to Cincinnati\" (referring to the Patriots' next opponent) several times in response to follow-up questions and criticisms of his team, Brady in particular.[104] Ultimately, they recorded a 12\u20134 record for the third straight season.[105] In the divisional round, they defeated the Baltimore Ravens by a score of 35\u201331.[106] In the AFC Championship Game, they defeated the Indianapolis Colts by a score of 45\u20137.[107] They reached Super Bowl XLIX, where they defeated the Seattle Seahawks by a score of 28\u201324.[108] With his fourth championship as head coach, Belichick tied Chuck Noll for most Super Bowl wins by a head coach.[109]\n\n\n\n![](image)Belichick with President Barack Obama and Robert Kraft\nIn the 2015 season, Belichick's Patriots recorded a 12\u20134 record for the fourth straight season.[110] They defeated the Kansas City Chiefs in the divisional round.[111] In the AFC Championship Game, they lost to the eventual Super Bowl 50 champion Denver Broncos by a score of 20\u201318.[112]\n\n\nIn the 2016 season, Belichick's Patriots recorded a 14\u20132 record, which earned them the #1 seed for the AFC playoffs.[113] In the divisional round, they defeated the Houston Texans.[114] In the AFC Championship Game, they defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers.[115] They reached Super Bowl LI, where they defeated the Atlanta Falcons in a comeback victory by a score of 34\u201328 in overtime.[116] The Patriots were down 28\u20133 at one point in the third quarter.[117] With the victory, Belichick won his record fifth Super Bowl title as a head coach.[118]\n\n\nIn the 2017 season, Belichick's Patriots went 13\u20133, setting an NFL record eighth consecutive 12-or-more-win seasons, capturing their ninth consecutive AFC East title and their 15th of the last 17 seasons. They defeated the Tennessee Titans in the divisional round by a score of 35\u201314, and the Jacksonville Jaguars in the AFC Championship Game by a score of 24\u201320, claiming their second consecutive AFC title, while also extending their record of consecutive AFC Championship Game appearances with seven.[119][120] Super Bowl LII was Belichick's eighth title game as head coach and his eleventh overall in any capacity, which was also the Patriots' tenth appearance, all extending NFL records. *The Ringer* wrote that Belichick's \"team is different from many of New England's famous teams from the previous decade: The first iteration of the Patriots dynasty relied on defense. This year, they are 29th in yards allowed (though fifth in points allowed) and instead have perfected the art of situational football\". The latter Patriots teams have been noted for mounting late comebacks in playoff games.[121][122]\n\n\nHowever, the Patriots fell to the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl LII, 41\u201333, as Eagles quarterback Nick Foles repeated his dominant NFC Championship Game performance and led Philadelphia to victory in a high-scoring game. The Patriots were down early, as they had been in most of their Super Bowl wins. However, they could not make a comeback this time, although they came very close. Eagles defensive end Brandon Graham strip-sacked Tom Brady to get the ball back with about 2 minutes to go in the 4th quarter. The Patriots did get the ball again before the end of the game, but they ran out of time to score.[123]\n\n\nIn the 2018 season, Belichick's Patriots went 11\u20135, failing to win 12 or more games for the first time since 2009. Despite this, the Patriots still captured their 10th consecutive AFC East title and their 16th of the last 18 years. They defeated the Los Angeles Chargers in the divisional round by a score of 41\u201328 and the Kansas City Chiefs in the AFC Championship Game 37\u201331 in a tough overtime game in Kansas City to advance to their third straight Super Bowl.[124][125] In Super Bowl LIII, the Patriots defeated the Los Angeles Rams 13\u20133 to give Belichick his sixth Super Bowl championship as a head coach and his eighth overall to have the most Super Bowl rings in NFL history. His six championships matched both George Halas and Curly Lambeau for most championships as a head coach. The Patriots' defense held the high-scoring Rams offense to 260 total yards.[126][127]\n\n\nOn May 13, 2019, Belichick announced that he would assume another role as the Patriots' defensive coordinator starting the 2019 season.[128] On October 27, 2019, with the Patriots' win over the Cleveland Browns, Belichick obtained his 300th win, regular and postseason combined, as a head coach.[129] The Patriots finished the 2019 regular season with a 12\u20134 record, winning their 11th consecutive AFC East title.[130] They were defeated in the wild-card round of the playoffs by the Tennessee Titans, led by former Patriots linebacker Mike Vrabel, by the final score of 20\u201313.[131]\n\n\n\n#### Brady goes to Tampa Bay, Cam Newton, and Mac Jones: 2020\u2013present[edit]\n\n\nFollowing the departure of Tom Brady to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Belichick and the Patriots were faced with an uncertain quarterback situation for the first time in nearly two decades.[132] During the offseason, the Patriots signed former Carolina Panthers starter Cam Newton for the 2020 NFL season.[133] The off-season routines and schedules, as well as the normal processes of regular season were severely disrupted by the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the unanticipated difficulties and challenges of the pandemic, the Patriots were in the hunt for a playoff spot until late in the season, ultimately finishing 7\u20139. 2020 was Belichick's first losing season since his first year in New England.[134]\n\n\nIn the 2021 NFL Draft, the Patriots selected quarterback Mac Jones with the 15th overall pick.[135] After Jones and Newton competed for the starting job during the preseason, Belichick made the decision to release Newton and name Jones the starter for the upcoming season.[136][137] In week 4 of that season, Brady's Buccaneers visited the Patriots in his first trip to Gillette Stadium since signing with the Patriots. A missed 56-yard field goal by Patriots kicker Nick Folk allowed Tampa Bay to narrowly escape with a 19\u201317 victory.[138] Immediately after the game, Brady and Belichick shared a quick embrace on the field before Brady greeted his former teammates and other members of the Patriots organization.[139] Though fans criticized Belichick for his lack of warmth displayed towards his former quarterback, the two privately spoke at length in the Buccaneers locker room following the match.[140] Belichick helped lead the Patriots to a 10\u20137 record in 2021. The team fell to the Buffalo Bills in the Wild Card Round.[141]\n\n\nIn the 2022 season, despite starting quarterback Mac Jones being injured in Week 3 and subsequently missing three more weeks, the Patriots remained in the hunt for a playoff spot until the last week, finishing with a record of 8-9.[142][143]\n\n\nIn Week 4 of the 2023 season, the Patriots lost to the Dallas Cowboys, 38\u20133. In doing so, Belichick suffered the worst loss of his coaching career (35 points).[144] The following week, the Patriots lost to the Saints, 34\u20130, giving Belichick his worst home loss of his career.[145] In Week 7, New England upset the Buffalo Bills 29\u201325 to earn Belichick his 300th career regular season win as an NFL head coach.[146]\n\n\n\n#### Overall record in New England[edit]\n\n\nUnder Belichick, the Patriots have a regular-season record of 262\u2013108\u20130 over 23 seasons.[147] Belichick is far and away the most successful coach in Patriots history; his 262 wins with the franchise are more than quadruple those of runner-up Mike Holovak. Belichick has also compiled a 30\u201312 record in the playoffs with New England, including a 6\u20133 record in Super Bowls. He has led the Patriots to 17 divisional titles, including five consecutive titles from 2003 to 2007 and eleven consecutive titles from 2009 to 2019. This streak of eleven consecutive playoff appearances is the most in NFL history for any team.[148]\n\n\n\n## Head coaching record[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Team | Year | Regular season | Postseason\n |\n| ---

Daboll, New York Giants (2022\u2013present)[175]\n\n\nThree of Belichick's former players have become NFL or NCAA head coaches:\n\n\n\n* Kliff Kingsbury, Texas Tech (2013\u20132018), Arizona Cardinals (2019\u20132022)[176]\n* Mike Vrabel, Tennessee Titans (2018\u2013present)[177]\n* Kevin O'Connell, Minnesota Vikings (2022\u2013present)[178]\n\n\nDuring the offseason, Belichick visits other football programs to learn from their experiences. For example, he has studied the Navy run offense, sought Bill Walsh (in past years) to understand more about the San Francisco 49ers as an organization and the West Coast offense as a system,[179] and spent time with Jimmy Johnson to learn about drafting and contract negotiations.[180]\n\n\nThe track record of Belichick's coaching tree has been characterized as poor. Former assistant coaches under Belichick had a combined 208\u2013296\u20131 (.413) record as head coaches of their own teams through November 28, 2020, and a number of them ended their brief tenures as head coaches by being fired midseason.[181] As of the end of the 2020 season, the only members of this coaching tree to have career NFL head coaching records above .500 were former coaches Groh (9\u20137) and O'Brien (52\u201348 during season, 2\u20134 in playoffs), and current coach Vrabel (29\u201319 during season, 2\u20132 in playoffs).[182]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nNick Saban and Belichick are good friends. In 2007, When Belichick spoke about their relationship, he said: \"Two successful Croats in the same division of NFL. You must admit, you don't see that every day.\"[183] In May 2018, President Donald Trump appointed Belichick to be a member of his Council on Sports, Fitness & Nutrition.[184]\n\n\nBelichick has an Alaskan Klee Kai dog named Nike.[185] Interest in the breed surged after Nike made an appearance on camera during the 2020 NFL Draft.[186]\n\n\n\n### Relationships[edit]\n\n\nBelichick married businesswoman Debby Clarke in 1977, but they divorced in the summer of 2006.[187][188] The couple have three children. They allegedly separated before the 2004 season, which was disclosed by the Patriots in July 2005. Belichick was also accused of maintaining a relationship with former Giants receptionist Sharon Shenocca, which helped precipitate her divorce.[189]\n\n\nStarting in 2007, Belichick was in a relationship with Linda Holliday, who was the executive director of the Bill Belichick Foundation.[190][191] The relationship ended in 2023.\n\n\n\n### Children[edit]\n\n\nHe has three children with Debby Clarke Belichick: Amanda, Stephen and Brian. \n\n\nAmanda is a 2007 graduate of Wesleyan University, where she, like her father, played lacrosse. After college, she worked at Connecticut preparatory school Choate Rosemary Hall as a lacrosse coach and in the admissions department. In 2009 she became an assistant coach for the University of Massachusetts Amherst women's lacrosse team,[192] before joining the Ohio State Buckeyes in the same position the next year.[193] After serving as interim head women's lacrosse coach at Wesleyan,[194] she was named head women's lacrosse coach at Holy Cross College in Massachusetts in July 2015.[195]\n\n\nStephen played lacrosse and football at Rutgers University on scholarship. He was hired as an assistant coach with the New England Patriots in May 2012,[196] was promoted to safeties coach in 2016,[197] and moved to outside linebackers coach in 2020.[198]\n\n\nBrian was hired to the Patriots' front office as a scouting assistant in 2016,[199] served as a coaching assistant from 2017 to 2019, and was promoted to safeties coach prior to the 2020 season.[200]\n\n\n\n### Declined Presidential Medal of Freedom[edit]\n\n\nOn January 10, 2021, *Politico* reported then-President Donald Trump planned to award Belichick the Presidential Medal of Freedom.[201] Belichick indicated that he was flattered to be considered for the honor, but declined the award in a statement issued the next day.[202] His statement referenced the January 6 United States Capitol attack, which had occurred a few days earlier, and cited his \"great reverence for our nation's values, freedom and democracy\" in light of that event.[203][204] A number of Massachusetts politicians, including Senator Ed Markey and Representative Jim McGovern, had previously called on him to decline after news of the award became public.[205]\n\n\n\n## Media and entertainment[edit]\n\n\n* The Belichick Plaza at Wesleyan University (formerly Warren Street lobby) was dedicated in recognition of the leadership and generosity of Belichick.[206]\n* *A Song of Ice and Fire* author George R.

Martin has mentioned Belichick and the Patriots in his interviews and in his work.[*citation needed*]\n* In the *Madden NFL* video game series, his name is not used because he is not a member of the NFL Coaches Association, which licenses the game. Belichick is the only NFL head coach who has chosen not to join the association.[207]\n* Belichick is well known as a fan of the rock band Bon Jovi, who visited Patriots training camp on August 14, 2006.[208][209] Their 2002 song \"Bounce\" is dedicated to Belichick.[210]\n* Belichick had a cameo appearance in an episode of the Denis Leary drama *Rescue Me* as a mourner at a funeral, alongside former Boston Bruin Phil Esposito.\n* The 2008 *South Park* episode \"Eek, a Penis!\" deals with fallout from the 2007 National Football League videotaping controversy.\n* In September 2011, a two-hour documentary following Belichick through the entire 2009 season was aired as the first two episodes of the NFL Network documentary series *A Football Life*. According to NFL Network, the premiere was the most-watched documentary in the history of the NFL Network, and the second-most watched broadcast in the Boston media market, beating all the broadcast networks, and finishing second only to a Boston Red Sox game.[211]\n* In the *Family Guy* episode \"3 Acts of God\" it is revealed that God won't let the New England Patriots win games because Belichick never smiles.[212]\n* Belichick's \"We're on to Cincinnati\" press conference during the 2014 season is spoofed by comedian Frank Caliendo.[213]\n* A glowering Belichick is featured in the third episode of the twenty-eighth season of *The Simpsons*, entitled \"The Town\".\n* Episode 96 of ESPN's *30 for 30* series is entitled \"The Two Bills\", and covers the history between Belichick and Bill Parcells.\n* In 2021, Belichick received a Sports Emmy for his work as an analyst on NFL Network's \"NFL 100 All-Time Team\" series in 2019.[214]\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)American football portal\n* ![](image)Biography portal\n\n\n* Brady\u2013Belichick era\n* List of National Football League head coach wins leaders\n* List of professional gridiron football coaches with 200 wins\n* List of Super Bowl head coaches\n* List of National Football League head coaches by playoff record\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Belichick exercises extensive authority over the Patriots' football operations, effectively making him the team's *de facto* general manager.[1]\n2. **^** The wins in Super Bowls XXI and XXV were as a defensive coordinator\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"New England Patriots' Biography of Bill Belichick\". *Patriots.com*.

He came to prominence as the offensive coordinator for the Atlanta Falcons, whose offense in 2016 led the league in points scored and helped the team reach Super Bowl LI. Shanahan became the head coach of the 49ers the following season, whom he has led to three playoff runs, two division titles, three NFC Championship Games, and a Super Bowl appearance in Super Bowl LIV.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nShanahan was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, while his father Mike Shanahan coached at the University of Minnesota.[2] He attended Saratoga High School in Saratoga, California in 1994, while his father worked as offensive coordinator for the San Francisco 49ers.[3] He later attended Cherry Creek High School in Greenwood Village, Colorado, while his father served as head coach of the Denver Broncos.[4] Shanahan accepted a scholarship offer by Carl Franks of Duke University, but chose to transfer as redshirt freshman to the University of Texas at Austin.[5] Shanahan played wide receiver on a Longhorn team that featured future college coach Major Applewhite as well as future NFL players Roy Williams, Cedric Benson, Bo Scaife, Mike Williams, Quentin Jammer, and Chris Simms.[6] Shanahan caught 14 passes for 127 yards in his career for the University of Texas at Austin.[7]\n\n\n\n## Coaching career[edit]\n\n\n### College career[edit]\n\n\n\n> I studied every potential Xs and Os play and issue possible. I spent my whole life working on that. My goal was that any question a player could have about anything on the field, I'd be able to answer it.\n> \n> \u2014\u200aKyle Shanahan, 2006[8]\n> \n\n\nSoon after he graduated from Texas in 2003, Shanahan became graduate assistant to Karl Dorrell at UCLA.[9][10]\n\n\n\n### Tampa Bay Buccaneers[edit]\n\n\nShanahan was hired as assistant coach for offensive quality control under head coach Jon Gruden with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2004.[11]\n\n\n\n### Houston Texans[edit]\n\n\nIn 2006, Shanahan was hired by Gary Kubiak to serve as wide receivers coach for the Houston Texans.[12] Kubiak had previously served as offensive coordinator under Mike Shanahan with the Broncos. At the time, Kyle Shanahan was the youngest position coach in the NFL. A season later, Shanahan received another promotion to become the Texans quarterback coach.[13] In 2007, he had also been offered to become offensive coordinator at the University of Minnesota, where former Broncos assistant Tim Brewster just became head coach. Shanahan declined, citing his decision to be an NFL coach.[14] Shanahan was immediately dealt as the frontrunner for the vacant offensive coordinator position after Mike Sherman had left the Texans to take over as head coach at Texas A&M University.[15]\n\n\nOn January 11, 2008, Shanahan was officially promoted, becoming the youngest coordinator in the NFL, being more than three years younger than Josh McDaniels of the New England Patriots.[16]\n\n\n\n### Washington Redskins[edit]\n\n\nIn 2010, Shanahan left the Texans to join his father, Mike Shanahan, with the Washington Redskins. The Washington Redskins\u2019 performance during his tenure led some to question whether Shanahan's hiring was an example of unearned nepotism.[17] In 2012, Shanahan was fined $25,000 for insulting the replacement officials and confronting one after a loss to the Cincinnati Bengals.[18] On December 30, 2013, Kyle, along with his father and some of the coaching staff, were fired from the Washington Redskins.[19]\n\n\n\n### Cleveland Browns[edit]\n\n\nOn February 1, 2014, it was reported by media outlets that Shanahan was hired as offensive coordinator for the Cleveland Browns.[20] Prior to his hiring by the Browns, Shanahan interviewed for the vacant offensive coordinator jobs held by the Miami Dolphins[21] and Baltimore Ravens.[22] On January 8, 2015, Shanahan resigned from his offensive coordinator position due to friction with head coach Mike Pettine and possibly how the front office was run.[23]\n\n\n\n### Atlanta Falcons[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Shanahan at Falcons training camp in 2016\nOn January 18, 2015, the Atlanta Falcons hired Shanahan as their new offensive coordinator.[24][25] After going 8\u20138 in 2015, the Falcons' offense under Shanahan was the highest-scoring offense in the league in 2016 and earned an 11\u20135 record, a division title, and a Super Bowl LI berth against the New England Patriots.[26] Shanahan was named the NFL Assistant Coach of the Year for the 2016 season.[27]\n\n\nDuring Super Bowl LI, the Falcons held a 28\u20133 lead over the Patriots, in part thanks to Shanahan's play-calling and the Falcons' execution of those plays. However, Shanahan was criticized for being too aggressive by not using a ball-control running attack late in the game which resulted in the Falcons losing by a score of 34\u201328 in overtime.[28][29]\n\n\n\n### San Francisco 49ers[edit]\n\n\nOn February 6, 2017, one day after the Super Bowl, Shanahan was officially hired as the next head coach of the San Francisco 49ers, signing a six-year deal.[30][31][32]\n\n\n\n#### 2017 season[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2017 San Francisco 49ers season\n\nShanahan won his first preseason game 27\u201317 against the Kansas City Chiefs on August 11, 2017.[33] However, the 49ers had begun the season 0\u20139.[34] On November 12, 2017, Shanahan won his first regular-season game against the New York Giants by a score of 31\u201321.[35] Three weeks later, he led the 49ers to a 15\u201314 victory over the Chicago Bears, which marked the first start for quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo as a 49er.[36] On December 31, 2017, the last day of the 2017 NFL regular season, Shanahan and the 49ers defeated the Los Angeles Rams 34\u201313, ending the season on a five-game win streak and winning six out of the last seven games.[37][38]\n\n\n\n#### 2018 season[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2018 San Francisco 49ers season\n\nThe 49ers managed to win only four games in 2018.[39] The team was impacted by an early season-ending torn ACL to starting quarterback Garoppolo.[40] Garoppolo's injury was immediately viewed as ruining the 49ers hopes for the season, despite Shanahan's optimistic outlook on Garoppolo's replacement, C.

Beathard.[41]\n\n\n\n#### 2019 season[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2019 San Francisco 49ers season\n\n![](image)Shanahan in a game against his former team, the Washington Redskins\nThe 49ers won their first eight games of the 2019 season, making Shanahan only the third coach, along with Tom Landry and Marvin Lewis to begin 8\u20130 after an earlier 0\u20138 season start.[34] The 49ers finished the regular season with a 13\u20133 record, winning the NFC West division title and securing the #1 seed which gave the team home-field advantage throughout the playoffs.[42][43]\n\n\nThe 49ers defeated the Minnesota Vikings 27\u201310 in the Divisional Round[44] and advanced to the NFC Championship, where they beat the Green Bay Packers 37\u201320[45] and advanced to Super Bowl LIV, where they lost to the Kansas City Chiefs 31\u201320.[46]\n\n\n\n#### 2020 season[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2020 San Francisco 49ers season\n\nOn June 15, 2020, the 49ers signed Shanahan to a new six-year contract extension through the 2025 season.[47][48] Shanahan was fined $100,000 by the NFL for not properly wearing a face mask, as required for coaches during the COVID-19 pandemic, during a Week 2 game in the 2020 NFL season on September 21, 2020.[49] The 49ers suffered multiple injuries to key starters throughout the season and missed the playoffs, finishing the season with a 6\u201310 record.[50][51][52]\n\n\n\n#### 2021 season[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2021 San Francisco 49ers season\n\nShanahan was fined $50,000 by the NFL on July 1, 2021, for violating practice rules during organized team activities.[53] After starting the season 3\u20135, the 49ers won seven of their last nine games to finish 10\u20137 and enter the postseason as a wild card team.[54][55] The 49ers defeated the Dallas Cowboys 23\u201317 in the Wild Card Round[56] and defeated the Green Bay Packers 13\u201310 in the Divisional Round,[57] before losing 20\u201317 in the NFC Championship to the eventual Super Bowl Champion Los Angeles Rams.[58]\n\n\n\n#### 2022 season[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2022 San Francisco 49ers season\n\nIn the 2022 season, Shanahan led the 49ers to a 13\u20134 regular season mark, which earned the team the NFC West title and the #2 seed in the NFC for the postseason. [59][60] The 49ers accomplished their regular season success in spite of injuries to Trey Lance and Jimmy Garoppolo. The emergence of rookie Brock Purdy as the team's starting quarterback in the latter part of the season contributed to the team's success.[61][62] Shanahan helped lead the 49ers to a third NFC Championship appearance in four seasons following victories over the Seattle Seahawks in the Wild Card Round and the Dallas Cowboys in the Divisional Round.[63][64] In the NFC Championship against the Philadelphia Eagles, the 49ers were forced to substitute Josh Johnson in for an injured Purdy. Johnson suffered a concussion and was forced to leave the game as well as well. Purdy then returned to finish the game, but was ineffective due to his injury. The Eagles won 31\u20137.[65]\n\n\n\n#### 2023 season[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2023 San Francisco 49ers season\n\nPrior to the 2023 season, Shanahan signed a contract extension through 2027.[66]\n\n\n\n## Head coaching record[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Team | Year | Regular season | Postseason\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Won | Lost | Ties | Win\u00a0% | Finish | Won | Lost | Win\u00a0% | Result\n |\n| SF | 2017 | 6 | 10 | 0 | .375 | 4th in NFC West | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014\n |\n| SF | 2018 | 4 | 12 | 0 | .250 | 3rd in NFC West | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014\n |\n| SF | 2019 | 13 | 3 | 0 | .813 | **1st in NFC West** | 2 | 1 | .667 | **Lost to Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl LIV** |\n| SF | 2020 | 6 | 10 | 0 | .375 | 4th in NFC West | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014\n |\n| SF | 2021 | 10 | 7 | 0 | .588 | **3rd in NFC West** | 2 | 1 | .667 | **Lost to Los Angeles Rams in NFC Championship Game** |\n| SF | 2022 | 13 | 4 | 0 | .765 | **1st in NFC West** | 2 | 1 | .667 | **Lost to Philadelphia Eagles in NFC Championship Game** |\n| SF | 2023 | 6 | 3 | 0 | .625 |  | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014\n |\n| Total | 58 | 49 | 0 | .543 |  | 6 | 3 | .667 |  |\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nShanahan and his wife have three children, Stella, Carter and Lexi.[67][68]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Kyle Shanahan Record, Statistics, and Category Ranks\". *Pro-Football-Reference.com*.

From 2006 to 2018, he was the head coach of the Green Bay Packers. In 2011, he led the team to a win in Super Bowl XLV over his hometown Pittsburgh Steelers. He was previously the offensive coordinator for the San Francisco 49ers and New Orleans Saints.\n\n\nDuring his 16 seasons as a head coach in the NFL, McCarthy has an overall regular season record of 155\u201397\u20132.[1] He is among the only five head coaches (Tom Landry, Chuck Noll, Andy Reid and Bill Belichick) to lead one franchise to eight straight playoff appearances. McCarthy is second to Curly Lambeau in all-time wins leading the Packers.[2]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nMcCarthy was born and raised in Pittsburgh, in the blue-collar neighborhood of Greenfield. His mother, Ellen McCarthy, was a secretary who also worked in restaurants and for the Peace & Justice Center.[3] His father, Joe McCarthy, was a firefighter for the Pittsburgh Fire Bureau and an officer for the Pittsburgh Police. He also owned a bar called Joe McCarthy's Bar and Grill,[4] which Mike spent his Sundays cleaning before church.[3] McCarthy was raised as a Pittsburgh Steelers fan.[5][6]\n\n\nMcCarthy was one of five siblings. He has three sisters, Colleen, Ellen, and Kellie, and a younger brother Joseph McCarthy III (d. 2015). Mike attended St. Rosalia primary school, where he played basketball.[3][7] He later made annual donations to the school.[3] McCarthy attended Bishop Boyle High School.[3]\n\n\n\n### Playing career[edit]\n\n\nIn 1984, McCarthy attended Scottsdale Community College in Arizona, playing one season for the Fighting Artichokes football team.[8][9] McCarthy transferred to Baker University, an NAIA school located in Baldwin City, Kansas. He was a two-time all-conference tight end.[8][10][11] In 1986 McCarthy was captain of\u00a0the team, which finished the season as the national runner-up in NAIA Division II.[8]\n\n\nIn 1987, McCarthy earned a B.S. in business administration.[12]\n\n\n\n## Coaching career[edit]\n\n\n### College[edit]\n\n\nIn 1987, Duane Dirk, the defensive coordinator at Fort Hays State University in Kansas, hired McCarthy as a defensive graduate assistant (GA). Over the next two years, McCarthy focused on linebackers and defensive ends.[13] During his time as the defensive graduate assistant, McCarthy pursued a master of science degree; he graduated with a M.S. in Sports Administration in 1989.[14]\n\n\nAfter serving as a graduate assistant at Fort Hays State from 1987 to 1988, McCarthy returned home to Pittsburgh. On July 30, 1989, McCarthy contacted Mike Gottfried, the head coach at the University of Pittsburgh, looking for a coaching job, but no positions were available. McCarthy was told to mail his resume. He later showed up at Gottfried's office without an appointment to introduce himself. A couple of days later, one of Gottfried's assistants resigned, and McCarthy was offered a volunteer coach position without pay.[15] McCarthy later worked under coach Paul Hackett.[6]\n\n\nHe served as a graduate assistant for three seasons before coaching wide receivers during the 1992 season. Initially, he also worked the night shift on the Pennsylvania Turnpike as a toll collector during the off-season to supplement his income.[16] McCarthy stated he spent his time in the tollbooth reviewing the University of Pittsburgh playbook.[3]\n\n\n\n### Kansas City Chiefs[edit]\n\n\nIn 1993, McCarthy and Paul Hackett left Pittsburgh and were hired by the NFL's Kansas City Chiefs under head coach Marty Schottenheimer.[6] McCarthy worked two years as an offensive quality control assistant. As Head Coach of the Green Bay Packers, McCarthy hired six former quality control coaches to serve as his position coaches.[17] In 1993 and 1994, McCarthy worked with Hall of Fame quarterback Joe Montana.[18]\n\n\nIn 1995, McCarthy became quarterbacks coach for the Chiefs, overseeing Rich Gannon, Elvis Grbac, and Steve Bono. McCarthy's signal callers threw 52 interceptions \u2014 the lowest in the American Football Conference (AFC) during the years from 1995 through 1998.[18]\n\n\n\n### Green Bay Packers[edit]\n\n\nWhen Schottenheimer resigned from the Chiefs after the 1998 season[19] McCarthy left Kansas City and became the Packers' quarterbacks coach. There he worked with Hall of Famer Brett Favre.[20] In the 1999 season, while working with McCarthy, Packers quarterback Brett Favre threw for 4,091 yards, the fourth-best total of his career.[18][21] While McCarthy was quarterbacks coach, the 1999 Packers team was ranked seventh in passing and ninth in overall offense in the league.[18]\n\n\n\n### New Orleans Saints[edit]\n\n\nIn 2000, McCarthy was hired as the offensive coordinator for the New Orleans Saints.[21] That year, the Saints achieved a 10\u20136 regular season record,[22] then\nwon their first playoff game in the franchise's history and finished 10th overall in offense.[23] McCarthy was selected as National Football Conference (NFC) Assistant Coach of the Year by USA Today in 2000.[23]\n\n\nThe Saints failed to make the playoffs over the next three years. In 2002 the Saints led the NFC in scoring, with 49 touchdowns and 432 points, but slowed down at the end of the season. In 2003, the Saints scored 340 points\u2014their eighth highest-scoring season ever. All of McCarthy's four years with the Saints rank in the team's top 10 years for offense.[18]\n\n\nWhile McCarthy was with the team, the Saints\u2019 offense set 25 individual and 10 team records. Joe Horn caught 45 touchdowns and 437 passes for 6,289 yards.[18] During McCarthy's time with the team, running backs Ricky Williams and Deuce McCallister both had a 1,000-yard season.[18] In his first two years, running back Ricky Williams would run for 2,245 yards with 14 touchdowns.[24] McCarthy stayed with the team for five seasons through 2004.[23]\n\n\n\n### San Francisco 49ers[edit]\n\n\nIn 2005, McCarthy served as offensive coordinator for the San Francisco 49ers by coach Mike Nolan.[25] His unit had setbacks, including the trade of their most experienced quarterback, Tim Rattay.[18] Rattay was replaced by a rookie quarterback, top draft pick Alex Smith, who was injured in week 7 of the season.[18]\n\n\nThe team finished the season ranked 30th in the NFL in points scored and dead last in yards gained.[26] Despite this, rookie running back Frank Gore would emerge to run for 608 rushing yards on 127 carries with a 4.8 Yards Per Carry (YPC).[27][28] Wide receiver Brandon Lloyd had 733 yards receiving and five touchdowns.[29][30]\n\n\n\n### Green Bay Packers[edit]\n\n\n![Mike McCarthy](image)Mike McCarthy 2007\n#### 2006\u20132009[edit]\n\n\nAfter Mike Sherman took the Packers to a 4-12 record in 2005, the team released him on January 2, 2006 and immediately started interviewing for a replacement.[31] McCarthy was interviewed by Packers general manager Ted Thompson on January 8, 2006, and was offered the head coaching position three days later.[20]\n\n\nIn 2006, the Packers started with a 4\u20138 record, but the team still managed to win their last four games after both quarterback Brett Favre and backup quarterback Aaron Rodgers sustained injuries, finishing the season 8\u20138, and ending with a win against their archrival, the Chicago Bears.[32][33]\n\n\nMcCarthy guided the Packers to an 8\u20131 record in the first 9 games of the 2007 season, tying Washington's Joe Gibbs for the best win\u2013loss ratio to start the first 25 games of a career at 16\u20139 and passing Vince Lombardi, who went 15\u201310, for the best coaching start in Packers' history.[34] The team finished the regular season with a 13\u20133 record and obtained the number two seed in the NFC playoffs.[35] McCarthy led the Packers to the NFC Championship game, where they lost to the eventual Super Bowl-winning New York Giants in overtime.\n\n\nAfter the 2007 season, he finished second in voting for The Associated Press Coach of the Year award, garnering 15 votes to Bill Belichick's 29 votes.[36] He signed a five-year contract extension with the team on January 19, 2008, which raised his salary to $3.4 million a year.[37]\n\n\nThe 2008 season was a tumultuous one. Aaron Rodgers, previously the backup, became the starting quarterback when Brett Favre announced his retirement in March. Favre then changed his mind and sought his previous position as the Green Bay quarterback. The organization reiterated its intent to move forward with Rodgers as the new face of the Packers, although Favre was offered the backup position behind Rodgers. Favre refused the offer, and the organization traded him to the New York Jets in exchange for a conditional fourth-round draft pick.[38]\n\n\nThe 2008 season started with a 5\u20135 record, followed by five consecutive losses. The season ended with a 31\u201321 victory over the Detroit Lions, bringing the Packers' regular season record to 6\u201310. The Packers finished third in the NFC North, ahead of only the Lions, and did not make the playoffs.[39] Under McCarthy, quarterback Aaron Rodgers threw for over 4,000 yards and posted a 93.8 passer rating.[40]\n\n\nRodgers improved on his 2008 statistics in 2009, but was sacked 50 times, more than any other quarterback in the NFL. The Packers dominated teams with losing records but were swept by their rival Minnesota Vikings, led by former Packers franchise quarterback Brett Favre. The Packers lost to the previously winless Tampa Bay Buccaneers, but then came back to beat the NFC East-leading Dallas Cowboys.[41] Under McCarthy's leadership, they then began a five-game winning streak and qualified for the playoffs with a Week 17 win over the Cardinals, finishing with an 11\u20135 record.\n\n\nThis was the second playoff berth in McCarthy's tenure.[42] The Packers lost the wild-card round to the Arizona Cardinals in overtime, 51\u201345.[43]\n\n\n\n#### 2010[edit]\n\n\n![](image)McCarthy and quarterback Aaron Rodgers in 2012\nIn 2010, the Packers had 25 players on the injured reserve list throughout the season. Running back Ryan Grant sustained an injury in week one that sidelined him for the rest of the season. McCarthy nonetheless led the Packers to a 10\u20136 regular season finish, never losing by more than four points and never trailing by more than 7 throughout the entire season.[44] This record earned them second place in the NFC North, behind the Chicago Bears,[45] with whom they split victories in the regular season.[46]\n\n\nThey went into the NFC playoffs as the sixth seed.[47] The Packers defeated the number three-seeded Philadelphia Eagles by a 21\u201316 score in the wild-card round. They then played the number one-seeded Atlanta Falcons, beating them by a convincing margin of 48\u201321.\n\n\nThe Packers then played the second-seeded Chicago Bears for the third time that season in the NFC Championship game. They won 21\u201314 and advanced to Super Bowl XLV. After this game, McCarthy's team had a 3\u20130 postseason record on the road.[46][48]\n\n\n\n##### Super Bowl XLV[edit]\n\n\nSuper Bowl XLV pitted the Packers against the Pittsburgh Steelers. This was the first time these two storied franchises had played each other in the postseason.[49] Ahead of the game, confident in his team's performance, McCarthy had the team fitted for Super Bowl championship rings.[50]\n\n\nThe Packers defeated the Steelers 31\u201325 to win their fourth Super Bowl and 13th NFL title overall.[51][49] The win returned the Lombardi Trophy to Green Bay for the first time since the team's 1996 season.[52]\n\n\n\n#### 2011\u20132017[edit]\n\n\nThe 2011 Packers team was a record-setting one, leading the NFL in points scored and setting a franchise record for wins at 15-1 and consecutive wins. McCarthy's offensive strategies facilitated quarterback Aaron Rodgers' NFL MVP season, as he threw for 4,643 yards and 45 touchdowns, throwing most often to receiver Jordy Nelson.[53][54]\n\n\nThe Packers' season ended, however, in the NFC Divisional Round, where they played the New York Giants. The team had suffered a number of setbacks, including the season-ending neck injury of defensive back Nick Collins, and appeared to have suffered, rather than benefited, from the time off, dropping 9 passes in this game.[53] Eli Manning of the Giants attacked the Packers\u2019 weaker defense (ranked 19th in scoring defense) and the Packers lost 37\u201320.[54]\n\n\n2012 saw the Packers attain an 11\u20135 record that ranked them first in the NFC North Division, the first time the Packers had won two consecutive NFC titles since the three they won during the 2002\u20132004 seasons. McCarthy's offensive strategies led to the Packers scoring 433 points, with Aaron Rodgers passing for 4,295 yards.[55] The 2012 postseason was the 28th time the franchise had secured a playoff berth.[56] After beating the Vikings in the first round they lost to the 49ers in the divisional round by a score of 45-31.\n\n\nIn 2013 McCarthy led the 2013 Packers to a regular season record of 8\u20137\u20131 and the NFC North title, the third consecutive division win.[57] That year, McCarthy took his team to their fifth straight playoff appearance.[58] During the summer of 2014, the village board of Ashwaubenon, Wisconsin voted to rename Potts Avenue \u201cMike McCarthy Way.\u201d[59]\n\n\nIn 2014 McCarthy guided the Packers to their fourth consecutive NFC North title with a 12\u20134 record during the regular season. The team ranked sixth in the NFL in total offense, with an average of 386 yards per game, and first in points scored, with an average of 30.4 points per game. In receiving yards, Jordy Nelson led the team with 1,519 yards. Aaron Rodgers threw for 4,381 yards and Eddie Lacy recorded 1,139 rushing yards.[60][61]\n\n\nIn November 2014, McCarthy signed a contract extension through 2018.[62] With a victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in week 16 of the 2014 season, McCarthy notched his 99th win, passing Hall of Famer Vince Lombardi (98) for second on the Packers' all-time wins list, behind only Hall of Famer Curly Lambeau (212).[63][64]\n\n\nThe Packers defeated the Dallas Cowboys in the divisional round of the playoffs, but then, in the NFC Championship game against the Seattle Seahawks, the Packers collapsed, despite holding a 16\u20130 lead at halftime and a 19\u20137 lead in the final minutes of the fourth quarter, going on to lose the game 22\u201328 in overtime. McCarthy was criticized after making several questionable play calls during this loss.[65] At the start of the game, he went for two field goals at the 1 yard line, and was criticized for \"not going for it\".[66] During the last five minutes of the game, McCarthy called three run plays to Eddie Lacy with 3:52 minutes left, and the Packers punted on fourth down; critics slammed McCarthy for \"not giving Aaron Rodgers a chance\" to win the game.[67] A day after the loss, McCarthy stated that he is \"not questioning his play-calling\", as well as stating that he \"came to run the ball\".[68]\n\n\nOthers defended him; in March 2015, at the annual owners' meetings, Bill Belichick stated that McCarthy is \"one of the best coaches I've ever gone up against.\"[69][70]\n\n\nNotwithstanding his rejection of the criticism of his heavily run-dependent strategy McCarthy relinquished play calling duties to long-time assistant Tom Clements in February 2015.[71]\n\n\nWhile the Packers made the playoffs for the seventh consecutive time after the 2015 season, the team struggled with a languishing running game. In December, McCarthy once again took over play calling responsibilities. After he did so, the Packers recorded a 28\u20137 victory over the Cowboys, running the ball for 230 yards.[72][73]\n\n\nThe 2016 season made Mike McCarthy the fourth head coach in the history of the NFL to take his team to eight-plus consecutive playoff appearances.[74] In the postseason, McCarthy's Packers won the wild card game against the Giants (38\u201313) and then the NFC Divisional Playoff against the Cowboys (34\u201331). The team lost to the Atlanta Falcons at the NFC Championship (44\u201321).[75]\n\n\nMcCarthy's 2017 team started the season with a 4\u20131 record, but was later hamstrung by an injury to Rodgers, who sustained a collarbone injury in week 6 versus Minnesota. Afterwards, backup quarterback Brett Hundley made his first career start.[76] With only a backup quarterback to work with, McCarthy failed to clinch a postseason appearance in 2017.[77]\n\n\n\n#### 2018[edit]\n\n\nOn January 2, 2018, it was announced that McCarthy had signed a one-year contract extension with the Green Bay Packers.[78]\n\n\nOn December 2, 2018, after a 20\u201317 loss to the Arizona Cardinals, McCarthy was released by the Packers after 13 seasons as the head coach.[79] He finished his tenure with the Packers with a 125\u201377\u20132 (.618) regular-season record and a 10\u20138 (.556) post-season record for a combined record of 135\u201385\u20132 (.613). McCarthy led the team to nine playoff appearances and a Super Bowl win.[1]\n\n\nThe timing of the personnel decision caught McCarthy by surprise, as he noted in an interview with ESPN.com. McCarthy said: \u201cTime provides the opportunity for reflection and clarity and that's where I'm at now. And it's clear to me now that both sides needed a change.\u201d[2]\n\n\n\n#### 2019 Hiatus[edit]\n\n\nAfter McCarthy was released as Packers head coach, he expressed plans to interview with the New York Jets and the Cleveland Browns.[80] The Arizona Cardinals expressed interest, but he declined to proceed with an interview.[81][82]\n\n\nMcCarthy's interview with the Browns was initially scheduled for Thursday, January 3,[83] before being moved to a week later.[84] The Browns offered McCarthy the head coach position, but he declined it, because it would have required him to retain Freddie Kitchens as offensive coordinator. The Browns hired Kitchens instead.[85]\n\n\nMcCarthy interviewed with the Jets on January 5, 2019.[86] The Jets also interviewed Kansas City Chiefs offensive coordinator Eric Bieniemy and former Miami Dolphins coach Adam Gase.[86] The Jets proceeded to hire Adam Gase.[87]\n\n\nOn January 9, 2019, McCarthy announced that he intended to sit out the 2019 season and return for 2020.[88] McCarthy spent time improving his football knowledge and strategies. In collaboration with fellow coaches such as Jim Haslett, Frank Cignetti Jr. and Scott McCurley, McCarthy studied league playbooks, league trends, and analytics, with the intention of returning to the NFL. He said that his \u201cMcCarthy Project\u201d made him \u201cdefinitely a better coach.\u201d[89]\n\n\n\n### Dallas Cowboys[edit]\n\n\n#### 2020\u20132021[edit]\n\n\nAfter Head Coach Jason Garrett parted ways with the Dallas Cowboys, McCarthy interviewed for the job. The interview for the vacant head coach position took place over 12 hours. McCarthy interviewed with Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, executive vice president Stephen Jones, and chief sales and marketing officer Jerry Jones Jr.\n\n\nOn January 7, 2020, McCarthy was announced as the Cowboys' new head coach.[90][91][92][93] McCarthy, who spent his season off watching game film and learning about analytics with fellow coaches, told Jones during the interview that he watched every play of the 2019 season. During his introductory press conference to announce his hiring, McCarthy said: \u201cI need to confess: I told Jerry I watched every play of the 2019 season. I wanted the job. You do what you gotta do right?\u201d[93]\n\n\nMcCarthy is the Cowboys' ninth head coach since the organization was founded in 1960. On September 13, 2020, McCarthy lost his debut as the head coach of the Cowboys against the Los Angeles Rams by a score of 20\u201317.[94] On September 20, 2020, McCarthy received his first win as the Cowboys' head coach in a 40\u201339 comeback win against the Atlanta Falcons.[95]\n\n\nThe Cowboys finished the 2020 season with a 6\u201310 record, placing third in the NFC East.[96] After losing starting quarterback Dak Prescott to a broken ankle early in the season (October 11), the Cowboys still remained in playoff contention in a weak conference for most of the season. The team struggled defensively, allowing 473 points, which was the Cowboys' worst-ever defensive showing.[97] After the season, the Cowboys released defensive coordinator Mike Nolan, along with defensive line coach Jim Tomsula.[98]\n\n\n\n#### 2021\u20132022[edit]\n\n\nMcCarthy was fined $50,000 by the NFL on July 1, 2021, for violating practice rules during organized team activities.[99] As a result of the fine, McCarthy said in a statement the majority of the 7 to 9 plays the NFL discussed with him involved younger players.[100]\n\n\nFrom July through September 2021, McCarthy and the Cowboys were featured on the HBO sports documentary *Hard Knocks*. The experience, which McCarthy called \u201ca good one,\u201d involved a large camera crew filming the entirety of Cowboys training camp.[101][102]\n\n\nFor the 2021 season, McCarthy guided the team to a 12-5 record and division title, including sweeping the entire NFC East for the first time since 1998.[103] After a week 9 loss to the Denver Broncos, McCarthy displayed a can of Anti-Monkey Butt powder in a presentation to the team. He informed the Cowboys that although the prior week\u2019s loss had been a \u201cRed Ass Week,\u201d McCarthy was confident his team would stage a comeback.[104][105] McCarthy missed the December 2nd game against the New Orleans Saints after testing positive for COVID 19 and being placed in COVID protocols for 10 days.[106] The Cowboys were upset at home by the San Francisco 49ers in the playoffs in the wild-card round. The game ended with the clock running out on the Cowboys following a quarterback draw as they attempted to spike the ball to stop the clock to permit a final pass play.\n\n\nMcCarthy was particularly criticized for his decision to use a quarterback draw with 14 seconds left in the fourth quarter, instead of going for two or more passes from further out.[107] McCarthy defended his decision, explaining that he was hoping to get another, easier play in after coming closer to the end zone and that he thought that 14 seconds was sufficient to allow his team to do this.[108]\n\n\n\n#### 2022\u20132023[edit]\n\n\nBefore the 2022 season, McCarthy was fined $100,000 by the NFL for violating offseason practice rules.[109] McCarthy canceled a preseason practice instead holding a team bonding golf event.[110]\n\n\nFor the 2022 season, McCarthy led the Cowboys to a 12-5 record, tying the 2021 season record and placing second in the NFC East.[111][112] In game 1 versus the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, quarterback Dak Prescott suffered a thumb fracture that required surgery and absence from the team until Week 7.[113][114] McCarthy replaced him with backup quarterback Cooper Rush who went 4-1 over the next five games.[114][115] McCarthy dealt with other injuries from key players including safety Jayron Kearse and left tackle Tyron Smith.[116] Before a week 9 game against the Packers, McCarthy got emotional about a return to Green Bay. He also said he was looking forward to seeing Aaron Rodgers.[117] McCarthy led the Cowboys to a 31-14 victory in the Wild Card game versus the Buccaneers, which according to Tom Brady would be the last game of his career.[118][119] McCarthy's season ended following the Cowboys\u2019 loss to the 49ers in the divisional round.[120]\n\n\nIn January 2023, McCarthy announced that the Cowboys would be parting ways with offensive coordinator Kellen Moore.[121] He also parted ways with six other coaches.[122] In February 2023, team owner Jerry Jones stated that McCarthy would call plays during the following season.[123] McCarthy hired new coaching staff, including assistant offensive line coach Ramon Chinyoung and offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer.[124][125]\n\n\n\n## Awards[edit]\n\n\nIn 2007, McCarthy was voted the Motorola NFL Coach of the Year[126] after twice receiving Coach of the Week awards.[127][128] He was also named the NFL Alumni's Coach of the Year by a group of former players.[129]\n\n\nIn 2008, McCarthy received the distinguished service award at the Lee Remmel sports awards banquet in Green Bay.[130] McCarthy was selected as National Football Conference (NFC) Assistant Coach of the Year by USA Today in 2000.[23]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nIn 1995, McCarthy and his high school sweetheart, Christine, amicably divorced. On March 15, 2008, Mike and Jessica McCarthy were married. The couple has five children between them; two sons from Jessica's previous marriage, a daughter from McCarthy's previous marriage[131] and two daughters together.[132][133][134]\n\n\nMcCarthy and his wife Jessica have a history of giving back to communities and people in need. The couple were involved with the Seven Loaves Project in Rwanda.[135] They founded the McCarthy Family Foundation, a charitable nonprofit. The McCarthy Family Foundation has donated frequently to the American Family Children's Hospital in Madison, Wisconsin. McCarthy hosts an annual golf tournament to benefit the hospital, and his foundation's fundraising was integral for the building of the hospital's Surgical Neonatal Intensive Care Unit.[136]\u00a0The Foundation has donated to the MVP Foundation which brings together combat veterans and former professional athletes as they transition to a new life off the field.[137]\n\n\nThe foundation has also donated $100,000 (which the Green Bay Packers matched) to the Green Bay Police Foundation. The funds were used to purchase protective equipment for police officers in the area. The money was also spent on outreach programs intended to build community relations, and on bias prevention training for the officers.[15]\n\n\nOn February 26, 2019, McCarthy was accused of berating three high school basketball referees after his stepsons playoff game. McCarthy went on a \"verbal tirade\" while following the officials to their locker room.

He has served as the quarterback coach of the Washington Commanders, Notre Dame, and the Atlanta Falcons and has been the offensive coordinator for the Los Angeles Rams and the Tennessee Titans.\n\n\n\n\n## Playing career[edit]\n\n\nBorn and raised in Mount Pleasant, Michigan, LaFleur attended Western Michigan University in Kalamazoo and played wide receiver in 1998 and 1999. He transferred to Saginaw Valley State in Division II, and he played quarterback from 2000 to 2002, guiding the Cardinals to the D-II playoffs each season.[3] LaFleur left Saginaw Valley State as their all-time leader in passing yards, completions, and passing touchdowns. LaFleur was inducted into the SVSU Cardinal Athletic Hall of Fame on October 1, 2021.\n\n\nLaFleur briefly played professionally in the National Indoor Football League with the Omaha Beef as the backup quarterback in 2003 and, the following summer, signed with the Billings Outlaws. LaFleur spent his time with the Beef eating only chicken, due to hazing from the older players. [4][5][6]\n\n\n\n## Coaching career[edit]\n\n\n### Early years[edit]\n\n\nLaFleur's coaching career began in 2003 at his alma mater, Saginaw Valley State, as an offensive graduate assistant, during which time he also substitute taught in the local high schools, specializing in math. LaFleur proceeded to Central Michigan University in Mount Pleasant and assisted the offensive staff in 2004 and 2005. In 2006, he coached quarterbacks and receivers at Northern Michigan University in Marquette. LaFleur was the offensive coordinator at Ashland University in Ohio in 2007.[7]\n\n\n\n### Houston Texans[edit]\n\n\nLaFleur then was hired in 2008 by the Houston Texans to serve as an offensive assistant. He assisted both wide receivers and quarterbacks during his two-year stint there and developed a close relationship with offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan.\n\n\n\n### Washington Redskins[edit]\n\n\nWhen Shanahan's father Mike was hired by the Washington Redskins, Kyle brought LaFleur to Washington to coach the quarterbacks in 2010.[8] From 2011 to 2013, LaFleur worked alongside 3 other future head coaches in Washington; Kyle Shanahan, Sean McVay, and Mike McDaniel. A primary responsibility of LaFleur's for the 2012 season was to mentor rookie quarterbacks Robert Griffin III and Kirk Cousins.[9]\n\n\n\n### Notre Dame[edit]\n\n\nAfter six years of coaching in the NFL, LaFleur returned to college football as the quarterbacks coach at the University of Notre Dame in 2014. LaFleur tutored senior quarterback Everett Golson who posted 3,445 yards and 29 touchdowns through the air, helping him become just the fourth quarterback in school history to eclipse such totals in a single season.[10]\n\n\n\n### Atlanta Falcons[edit]\n\n\n![](image)LaFleur with the Falcons in 2016\nOn February 5, 2015, LaFleur returned to the NFL as the quarterbacks coach for the Atlanta Falcons working under offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan, with whom he had previously worked with while with the Washington Redskins and Houston Texans. LaFleur's younger brother, Mike, was also an offensive assistant with the Falcons.[11]\n\n\nIn 2016, LaFleur coached Matt Ryan on his way to winning his sole NFL MVP award. The Falcons reached Super Bowl LI, where they faced the New England Patriots, but squandered a large lead and lost 34\u201328 in overtime.[12]\n\n\n\n### Los Angeles Rams[edit]\n\n\nOn February 8, 2017, LaFleur joined the Los Angeles Rams coaching staff as offensive coordinator, working under head coach Sean McVay, with whom he had previously worked during his tenure with the Washington Redskins.[13] Under LaFleur and McVay, the Rams finished the year with an 11\u20135 record and as the league's number one scoring offense, scoring 478 points through 16 games.[14]\n\n\n\n### Tennessee Titans[edit]\n\n\nOn January 30, 2018, LaFleur left his position with the Rams to take the same position with the Tennessee Titans.[15] Joining new head coach Mike Vrabel, LaFleur's role in directing the offense increased, as he had play-calling responsibilities unlike during his tenure with the Rams.[16] The season was plagued with injuries, with the Titans losing star tight end Delanie Walker in Week 1, and Mariota dealing with an incessant nerve injury throughout the season.[17] LaFleur and the Titans finished the season with the 27th ranked scoring offense in the NFL.[18]\n\n\n\n### Green Bay Packers[edit]\n\n\nLaFleur was hired as the head coach of the Green Bay Packers on January 8, 2019.[19] On May 30, 2019, LaFleur suffered a torn Achilles while playing basketball.[20] LaFleur also led the Packers to a 2\u20132 preseason.[21]\n\n\n\n#### 2019 season[edit]\n\n\nOn September 5, 2019, LaFleur made his regular-season head coaching debut against the Chicago Bears, and led the Packers to a 10\u20133 victory.[22] He also became the first Green Bay coach to win his first game against the Bears since Vince Lombardi in 1959.[23] The Packers finished with a 13\u20133 record in LaFleur's first season as a head coach, and in the process, LaFleur became the first Packers rookie head coach to win 10 games, make the playoffs, and win the NFC North (as well as going 6\u20130 in division play in the process). In addition, the 13 wins were the most from a rookie coach since Jim Harbaugh did it with the 49ers in 2011.\n\n\nLaFleur led Green Bay to their first postseason berth since the 2016 season as the NFC's number two seed, as he won his postseason debut against the Seattle Seahawks 28\u201323 in the divisional round of the playoffs to advance to the NFC Championship Game, where the Packers fell to the top-seeded San Francisco 49ers 37\u201320.\n\n\n\n#### 2020 season[edit]\n\n\nThe Packers began the 2020 season by winning all four games prior to an early Week 5 bye. After a 5\u20131 start, LaFleur lost his first-ever divisional game, with a 22\u201328 home loss to the Minnesota Vikings.[24] Despite this, the Packers continued rolling, and LaFleur clinched his second consecutive NFC North title and playoff berth in Week 14 with a 31\u201324 victory against the Detroit Lions. With a 35\u201316 win over the Chicago Bears in Week 17, Green Bay clinched the NFC's number one seed and home-field advantage throughout the playoffs for the first time since the 2011 season. The Packers also closed the season out on a six-game winning streak, and LaFleur extended his win\u2013loss record in December games to 9\u20130.\n\n\nLaFleur finished with a 26\u20136 record in his first two seasons as coach, tied for the second-best start for a coach since the 1970 merger (only George Seifert, at 28\u20134, has a better record). His team finished as the league's number one offense, scoring 509 points over the course of the season, and with quarterback Aaron Rodgers throwing for a Packers franchise-record 48 touchdowns.[25]\n\n\nIn the playoffs, LaFleur and the Packers hosted the Los Angeles Rams, who had the league's number one scoring defense and were led by one of LaFleur's former bosses, Rams coach Sean McVay.[26] The Packers defeated the Rams, 32\u201318,[27] to host the NFC Championship Game for the first time since 2007, where they lost to the eventual Super Bowl champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers, 31\u201326. LaFleur was criticized for his decision to kick a field goal when the Packers were down 31-23 instead of trying to tie the game with a touchdown and a two-point conversion under league MVP Aaron Rodgers.[28]\n\n\n\n#### 2021 season[edit]\n\n\nLaFleur's 2021 season began with a 38\u20133 loss to the New Orleans Saints. They proceeded to win each of their next six games to bring the 6\u20131 Packers to a Thursday night showdown with the NFL's last unbeaten team, the 7\u20130 Arizona Cardinals. In addition to playing on the road on a short week, the Packers were forced to play without their top three wide receivers, after Davante Adams and Allen Lazard tested positive for COVID-19[29] and Marquez Valdes-Scantling remained out with a hamstring injury since Week 3. Despite the challenges, the Packers emerged victorious, 24\u201321 with a thrilling last-minute interception of Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray by cornerback Rasul Douglas, and LaFleur became the winningest head coach through his first 40 career games in NFL history.[30]\n\n\nThe following week, star quarterback Aaron Rodgers tested positive for COVID-19,[31] and LaFleur named second-year quarterback Jordan Love the starter for their Week 9 game against the Kansas City Chiefs. Although Love was relentlessly blitzed during his first career start, he managed to complete 19 of 34 passes for 190 yards, 1 touchdown and 1 interception. LaFleur took the blame for not being able to counter the Chiefs' aggressive defensive strategies.[32] Special teams miscues ultimately cost the Packers the game, falling 7\u201313 to drop them to 7\u20132.\n\n\nThe Packers then shut out Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson the following week, the first such occurrence in his career, to win their Week 10 game 17\u20130. In Week 11, LaFleur's Packers fell 31\u201334 to their division rival Minnesota Vikings, but rebounded to win 36\u201328 against LaFleur's former boss Sean McVay and the Los Angeles Rams the following week. The Packers clinched their third consecutive NFC North title with a tight 31\u201330 Week 15 victory over the Baltimore Ravens. LaFleur became the first head coach since Dallas's Barry Switzer to win the division in each of his first three years as head coach.\n\n\nWith a 37\u201310 Week 17 victory over the Minnesota Vikings, LaFleur's Packers clinched home-field advantage throughout the NFC playoffs and became the first team in NFL history to win 13 games a season in 3 consecutive years. In addition, LaFleur broke a 30-year-old record by George Seifert for the most wins by a head coach (39) through his first 3 seasons in the league. The win also meant to this point in his career, LaFleur had never lost consecutive regular season games during his 3-year tenure.\n\n\nThe Packers dealt with a notable amount of injuries throughout the season. Top pass-rusher Za'Darius Smith had not played since Week 1, while top cornerback Jaire Alexander had been out since spraining his shoulder in Week 4. Top tackle David Bakhtiari tore his ACL during the 2020 season, and didn't return until Week 18. His replacement, offensive lineman Elgton Jenkins, was lost for the season with a similar ACL injury in Week 11. In addition, starting tight end Robert Tonyan met a similar fate during the Packers' Week 8 showdown in Arizona.[33]\n\n\nAt the end of the regular season, quarterback Aaron Rodgers was named NFL MVP for the second consecutive year and for the fourth time in his career. Rodgers noted LaFleur's contributions to his winning MVP in 2 of LaFleur's 3 seasons as head coach. Rodgers became the first player in the NFL to win consecutive MVP awards in 12 years, when Peyton Manning won in 2008 and 2009. In the playoffs, they lost their first game to the San Francisco 49ers, 13\u201310, giving LaFleur a 2\u20133 postseason record and no Super Bowl appearances in their three straight 13-win seasons. He took the blame for the Packers\u2019 poor special teams effort, particularly one play where they were missing a man on the field during San Francisco's game-winning field goal.[34]\n\n\n\n#### 2022 season[edit]\n\n\nLaFleur's 2022 season as head coach began with another opening day loss this time to the Minnesota Vikings. The Packers would go on to win 3 straight, however, after the 3\u20131 start the season started to fall apart. In their next 8 games they would just go 1\u20137, making their record on the year 4\u20138.\n\n\nThe Packers won their next 4 games in a row to get back to a .500 record, setting up a matchup with the Detroit Lions at home with a playoff berth on the line. The Packers would ultimately lose 20\u201316, finishing with an 8\u20139 record and giving Matt LaFleur his first losing season as head coach, as well as his first missing the playoffs.\n\n\n\n## Head coaching record[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Team | Year | Regular season | Postseason\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Won | Lost | Ties | Win\u00a0% | Finish | Won | Lost | Win\u00a0% | Result\n |\n| GB | 2019 | 13 | 3 | 0 | .813 | **1st in NFC North** | 1 | 1 | .500 | **Lost to San Francisco 49ers in NFC Championship Game** |\n| GB | 2020 | 13 | 3 | 0 | .813 | **1st in NFC North** | 1 | 1 | .500 | **Lost to Tampa Bay Buccaneers in NFC Championship Game** |\n| GB | 2021 | 13 | 4 | 0 | .765 | **1st in NFC North** | 0 | 1 | .000 | **Lost to San Francisco 49ers in NFC Divisional Game** |\n| GB | 2022 | 8 | 9 | 0 | .471 | 3rd in NFC North | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014\n |\n| GB | 2023 | 4 | 6 | 0 | .286 |  | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014\n |\n| Total | 51 | 25 | 0 | .671 |  | 2 | 3 | .400 |  |\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nLaFleur is married to BreAnne Maak, whom he met in college, and they have two sons, Luke and Ty.[35] His younger brother, Mike, is the offensive coordinator for the Los Angeles Rams.[36] Robert Saleh was the best man at LaFleur's wedding, as the two became close while working as graduate assistants at Central Michigan and as assistant coaches for the Houston Texans from 2008\u20132009.[37]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Happy Birthday to Head Coach Matt LaFleur!\". *Green Bay Packers*.
