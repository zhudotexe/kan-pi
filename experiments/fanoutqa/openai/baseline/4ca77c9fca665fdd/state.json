CormenCharles E. LeisersonRonald L. RivestClifford Stein |\n| Language | English |\n| Subject | Computer algorithms |\n| Publisher | MIT Press |\n| Publication date\n | 1990 (first edition) |\n| Publication place | United States |\n| Pages | 1312 |\n| ISBN | 978-0-262-04630-5 |\n\n\n***Introduction to Algorithms*** is a book on computer programming by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford Stein. The book has been widely used as the textbook for algorithms courses at many universities[1] and is commonly cited as a reference for algorithms in published papers, with over 10,000 citations documented on CiteSeerX.[2] The book sold half a million copies during its first 20 years.[3] Its fame has led to the common use of the abbreviation \"**CLRS**\" (Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, Stein), or, in the first edition, \"**CLR**\" (Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest).[4]\n\n\nIn the preface, the authors write about how the book was written to be comprehensive and useful in both teaching and professional environments. Each chapter focuses on an algorithm, and discusses its design techniques and areas of application. Instead of using a specific programming language, the algorithms are written in pseudocode. The descriptions focus on the aspects of the algorithm itself, its mathematical properties, and emphasize efficiency.[5]\n\n\n\n\n## Editions[edit]\n\n\nThe first edition of the textbook did not include Stein as an author, and thus the book became known by the initialism CLR. It included two chapters (\"Arithmetic Circuits\" & \"Algorithms for Parallel Computers\") that were dropped in the second edition. After the addition of the fourth author in the second edition, many began to refer to the book as \"CLRS\". This first edition of the book was also known as \"The Big White Book (of Algorithms).\" With the second edition, the predominant color of the cover changed to green, causing the nickname to be shortened to just \"The Big Book (of Algorithms).\"[6] The third edition was published in August 2009. The fourth edition was published in April 2022, which has colors added to improve visual presentations.[7]\n\n\n\n## Cover design[edit]\n\n\nThe mobile depicted on the cover, *Big Red* (1959) by Alexander Calder, can be found at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City.[8] *An Introduction to Language* by Fromkin also uses Calder's mobile on its cover.\n\n\n\n## Table of contents[edit]\n\n\nSource[9]\n\n\n\n* I Foundations\n\t+ 1 The Role of Algorithms in Computing\n\t+ 2 Getting Started\n\t+ 3 Characterizing Running Times\n\t+ 4 Divide-and-Conquer\n\t+ 5 Probabilistic Analysis and Randomized Algorithms\n* II Sorting and Order Statistics\n\t+ 6 Heapsort\n\t+ 7 Quicksort\n\t+ 8 Sorting in Linear Time\n\t+ 9 Medians and Order Statistics\n* III Data Structures\n\t+ 10 Elementary Data Structures\n\t+ 11 Hash Tables\n\t+ 12 Binary Search Trees\n\t+ 13 Red-Black Trees\n* IV Advanced Design and Analysis Techniques\n\t+ 14 Dynamic Programming\n\t+ 15 Greedy Algorithms\n\t+ 16 Amortized Analysis\n* V Advanced Data Structures\n\t+ 17 Augmenting Data Structures\n\t+ 18 B-Trees\n\t+ 19 Data Structures for Disjoint Sets\n* VI Graph Algorithms\n\t+ 20 Elementary Graph Algorithms\n\t+ 21 Minimum Spanning Trees\n\t+ 22 Single-Source Shortest Paths\n\t+ 23 All-Pairs Shortest Paths\n\t+ 24 Maximum Flow\n\t+ 25 Matching in Bipartite Graphs\n* VII Selected Topics\n\t+ 26 Parallel Algorithms\n\t+ 27 Online Algorithms\n\t+ 28 Matrix Operations\n\t+ 29 Linear Programming\n\t+ 30 Polynomials and the FFT\n\t+ 31 Number-Theoretic Algorithms\n\t+ 32 String Matching\n\t+ 33 Machine-Learning Algorithms\n\t+ 34 NP-Completeness\n\t+ 35 Approximation Algorithms\n* VIII Appendix: Mathematical Background\n\t+ A Summations\n\t+ B Sets, Etc.\n\t+ C Counting and Probability\n\t+ D Matrices\n\n## Publication history[edit]\n\n\n* Cormen, Thomas H.; Leiserson, Charles E.; Rivest, Ronald L.

As part of this effort, he developed the Cilk multithreaded language. He invented the fat-tree interconnection network, a hardware-universal interconnection network used in many supercomputers, including the Connection Machine CM5, for which he was network architect. He helped pioneer the development of VLSI theory, including the retiming method of digital optimization with James B. Saxe and systolic arrays with H. T. Kung. He conceived of the notion of cache-oblivious algorithms, which are algorithms that have no tuning parameters for cache size or cache-line length, but nevertheless use cache near-optimally. He developed the Cilk language for multithreaded programming, which uses a provably good work-stealing algorithm for scheduling. Leiserson coauthored the standard algorithms textbook *Introduction to Algorithms* together with Thomas H. Cormen, Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford Stein.\n\n\nLeiserson received a BS degree in computer science and mathematics from Yale University in 1975 and a PhD degree in computer science from Carnegie Mellon University in 1981, where his advisors were Jon Bentley and H. T. Kung.[2]\n\n\nHe then joined the faculty of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he is now a professor. In addition, he is a principal in the Theory of Computation research group in the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, and he was formerly director of research and director of system architecture for Akamai Technologies. He was Founder and chief technology officer of Cilk Arts, Inc., a start-up that developed Cilk technology for multicore computing applications. (Cilk Arts, Inc. was acquired by Intel in 2009.)\n\n\nLeiserson's dissertation, *Area-Efficient VLSI Computation*, won the first ACM Doctoral Dissertation Award. In 1985, the National Science Foundation awarded him a Presidential Young Investigator Award. He is a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), and the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM). He received the 2014 Taylor L. Booth Education Award from the IEEE Computer Society \"for worldwide computer science education impact through writing a best-selling algorithms textbook, and developing courses on algorithms and parallel programming.\" He received the 2014 ACM-IEEE Computer Society Ken Kennedy Award for his \"enduring influence on parallel computing systems and their adoption into mainstream use through scholarly research and development.\" He was also cited for \"distinguished mentoring of computer science leaders and students.\" He received the 2013 ACM Paris Kanellakis Theory and Practice Award for \"contributions to robust parallel and distributed computing.\"\n\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Thinking Machines Corporation\n* Thomas H.

Stein is chair of the Industrial Engineering and Operations Research Department at Columbia University. Prior to joining Columbia, Stein was a professor at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire.\n\n\nStein's research interests include the design and analysis of algorithms, combinatorial optimization, operations research, network algorithms, scheduling, algorithm engineering and computational biology.\n\n\nStein has published many influential papers in the leading conferences and journals in his fields of research, and has occupied a variety of editorial positions including in the journals *ACM Transactions on Algorithms*, *Mathematical Programming*, *Journal of Algorithms*, *SIAM Journal on Discrete Mathematics* and *Operations Research Letters*. His work has been funded by the National Science Foundation and the Sloan Foundation. As of November 1, 2015, his publications have been cited over 46,000 times, and he has an h-index of 42.[2]\n\n\nStein is the winner of several prestigious awards including an NSF Career Award, an Alfred Sloan Research Fellowship and the Karen Wetterhahn Award for Distinguished Creative or Scholarly Achievement. He is also the co-author of two textbooks: \n\n\n\n* *Introduction to Algorithms*, with T. Cormen, C. Leiserson and R. Rivest, which is currently the best-selling textbook in algorithms and has been translated into 8 languages. About 39,500 of Stein's 46,000 citations are made to this book.\n* *Discrete Mathematics for Computer Science*, with Ken Bogart and Scot Drysdale, which is a new textbook that covers discrete math at an undergraduate level.\n\n\nStein earned his B.S.E. from Princeton University in 1987, a Master of Science from The Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1989, and a PhD also from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1992.[3][4]\n\n\nIn recent years, Stein has built up close ties with the Norwegian research community which earned him an honorary doctorate from the University of Oslo (May 2010).\n\n\n\n## Bibliography[edit]\n\n\n* Cormen, Thomas H.; Leiserson, Charles E.; Rivest, Ronald L.; Stein, Clifford (2001). *Introduction to Algorithms* (second\u00a0ed.).
