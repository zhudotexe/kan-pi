Riot specified that it should weigh 70 pounds (about 32 kilograms), though the actual weight of the finished cup was reduced so it would not be too heavy to lift in victory.\nThe World Championship Cups for 2012 and for 2014 were created by Thomas Lyte.[82]\n\n\nIn 2022, Riot Games announced the formation of a multi-year partnership with American jewelry brand Tiffany & Co., producing a newly designed Summoner's Cup with a weight of 44 pounds (about 20 kilograms).[83]\n\n\n\n## Results[edit]\n\n\n### By year[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Location\n | Final\n | No. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Champion\n | Score\n | Runner-up\n |\n| 2011 | Jönköping | Fnatic | 2\n | 1\n | against All authority\n | 8\n |\n| 2012 | Los Angeles | Taipei Assassins | 3\n | 1\n | Azubu Frost | 12\n |\n| 2013 | Culver City Los Angeles\n | SK Telecom T1 | 3\n | 0\n | Royal Club | 14\n |\n| 2014 | Singapore Taipei BusanSeoul | Samsung White | 3\n | 1\n | Star Horn Royal Club\n | 16\n |\n| 2015 | Paris London Brussels Berlin | SK Telecom T1\n | 3\n | 1\n | KOO Tigers | 16\n |\n| 2016 | San Francisco Chicago New York Los Angeles\n | SK Telecom T1\n | 3\n | 2\n | Samsung Galaxy | 16\n |\n| 2017 | Wuhan Guangzhou Shanghai Beijing | Samsung Galaxy\n | 3\n | 0\n | SK Telecom T1\n | 24\n |\n| 2018 | Seoul Busan Gwangju Incheon | Invictus Gaming | 3\n | 0\n | Fnatic\n | 24\n |\n| 2019 | Berlin Madrid Paris\n | FunPlus Phoenix | 3\n | 0\n | G2 Esports | 24\n |\n| 2020 | Shanghai\n | Damwon Gaming | 3\n | 1\n | Suning | 22\n |\n| 2021 | Reykjavík | Edward Gaming | 3\n | 2\n | DWG KIA\n | 22\n |\n| 2022 | Mexico CityNew YorkAtlantaSan Francisco\n | DRX | 3\n | 2\n | T1\n | 24\n |\n| 2023 | BusanSeoul\n | T1\n | 3\n | 0\n | Weibo Gaming\n | 22\n |\n| 2024 | London\n |  |  |  |  |  |\n\n\n### By region[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Region\n | Titles\n | Runner-up\n | Total\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| South Korea (LCK)\n | 8\n | 6\n | 14\n |\n| China (LPL)\n | 3\n | 4\n | 7\n |\n| EMEA (LEC)\n | 1\n | 3\n | 4\n |\n| Asia-Pacific (PCS)[b] | 1\n | 0\n | 1\n |\n\n\n### By team[edit]\n\n\n*Italics* indicates a team/organization has been disbanded, acquired or no longer participates in the regional league.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Team\n | Region\n | Champions\n | Runners-up\n | Total\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| T1[c] | South Korea (LCK)\n | 4\n | 2\n | 6\n |\n| Gen.G[d] | South Korea (LCK)\n | 2[e] | 1[e] | 3\n |\n| Fnatic | EMEA (LEC)\n | 1\n | 1\n | 2\n |\n| Dplus KIA[f] | South Korea (LCK)\n | 1\n | 1\n | 2\n |\n| Invictus Gaming | China (LPL)\n | 1\n | 0\n | 1\n |\n| J Team[g] | Asia-Pacific (PCS)\n | 1[h] | 0\n | 1\n |\n| FunPlus Phoenix | China (LPL)\n | 1\n | 0\n | 1\n |\n| Edward Gaming | China (LPL)\n | 1\n | 0\n | 1\n |\n| DRX | South Korea (LCK)\n | 1\n | 0\n | 1\n |\n| Royal Never Give Up[i] | China (LPL)\n | 0\n | 2\n | 2\n |\n| Weibo Gaming[j] | China (LPL)\n | 0\n | 2[k] | 2\n |\n| G2 Esports | EMEA (LEC)\n | 0\n | 1\n | 1\n |\n| Hanwha Life Esports[l] | South Korea (LCK)\n | 0\n | 1[m] | 1\n |\n| *against All authority* | EMEA (LEC)\n | 0\n | 1\n | 1\n |\n| *CJ Entus* | South Korea (LCK)\n | 0\n | 1[n] | 1\n |\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The qualifier was available only for Philippines and Singapore.

In the final, DRX defeated T1 3–2 in a close series, becoming the first team to win the championship after starting from the play-in stage.[69][70] DRX's top laner, Hwang \"Kingen\" Seong-hoon, was named the MVP of the series.[71] Their victory was considered a Cinderella and underdog success story, as they had come from the play-in stage as Korea's fourth seed representative, and had beaten some of the more favored and accomplished teams along the way, including the previous worlds champions Edward Gaming in a 3–2 reverse sweep in the quarterfinals, and defeating the LCK Summer Split champions Gen.G 3–1 in the semifinals.[72]\n\n\n\n### 2023[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2023 League of Legends World Championship\n\nThe 2023 World Championship was held from 10 October to 19 November 2023, with the event taking place in two cities across South Korea: Seoul and Busan. Twenty-two teams qualified to participate at the World Championship based on placement within their own regional leagues and previous regional results in international play.[73] Albeit, one team qualified for the event through the newly-inaugurated Worlds Qualifying Series between the fourth-seeded teams from the LEC and LCS.[74]\n\n\nThe format for the event differed to the previous editions, with the introduction of a play-in stage, consisting of eight teams who are split into two double elimination brackets. There, three teams qualified to the second stage of the event where the qualifying teams, along with thirteen other teams, faced off in a swiss-system tournament to determine the qualifiers to the knockout stage, with the eventual champions being crowned at the conclusion of the single-elimination knockout stage.[75]\n\n\nThe finals was played at the Gocheok Sky Dome on 19 November, 2023 between Weibo Gaming from the League of Legends Pro League (LPL), and previous years' finalist T1 from the League of Legends Champions Korea (LCK).[76] In the final, T1 defeated Weibo Gaming 3–0, extending their record for the most world championships won by single team with four titles.[77] T1's top laner, Choi \"Zeus\" Woo-je, was named the MVP of the series, while fellow teammate Lee \"Faker\" Sang-hyeok became the first player to win four World Championships.[78][79]\n\n\n\n### 2024[edit]\n\n\nDuring the finals' broadcast of the 2023 World Championship, it was announced that the 2024 World Championship final will take place in London at The O2 Arena on 2 November 2024.[80][81]\n\n\n\n## Trophy[edit]\n\n\nRiot Games, which owns *League of Legends*, commissioned the winner's trophy as the Summoner's Cup. Riot specified that it should weigh 70 pounds (about 32 kilograms), though the actual weight of the finished cup was reduced so it would not be too heavy to lift in victory.\nThe World Championship Cups for 2012 and for 2014 were created by Thomas Lyte.[82]\n\n\nIn 2022, Riot Games announced the formation of a multi-year partnership with American jewelry brand Tiffany & Co., producing a newly designed Summoner's Cup with a weight of 44 pounds (about 20 kilograms).[83]\n\n\n\n## Results[edit]\n\n\n### By year[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Location\n | Final\n | No. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Champion\n | Score\n | Runner-up\n |\n| 2011 | Jönköping | Fnatic | 2\n | 1\n | against All authority\n | 8\n |\n| 2012 | Los Angeles | Taipei Assassins | 3\n | 1\n | Azubu Frost | 12\n |\n| 2013 | Culver City Los Angeles\n | SK Telecom T1 | 3\n | 0\n | Royal Club | 14\n |\n| 2014 | Singapore Taipei BusanSeoul | Samsung White | 3\n | 1\n | Star Horn Royal Club\n | 16\n |\n| 2015 | Paris London Brussels Berlin | SK Telecom T1\n | 3\n | 1\n | KOO Tigers | 16\n |\n| 2016 | San Francisco Chicago New York Los Angeles\n | SK Telecom T1\n | 3\n | 2\n | Samsung Galaxy | 16\n |\n| 2017 | Wuhan Guangzhou Shanghai Beijing | Samsung Galaxy\n | 3\n | 0\n | SK Telecom T1\n | 24\n |\n| 2018 | Seoul Busan Gwangju Incheon | Invictus Gaming | 3\n | 0\n | Fnatic\n | 24\n |\n| 2019 | Berlin Madrid Paris\n | FunPlus Phoenix | 3\n | 0\n | G2 Esports | 24\n |\n| 2020 | Shanghai\n | Damwon Gaming | 3\n | 1\n | Suning | 22\n |\n| 2021 | Reykjavík | Edward Gaming | 3\n | 2\n | DWG KIA\n | 22\n |\n| 2022 | Mexico CityNew YorkAtlantaSan Francisco\n | DRX | 3\n | 2\n | T1\n | 24\n |\n| 2023 | BusanSeoul\n | T1\n | 3\n | 0\n | Weibo Gaming\n | 22\n |\n| 2024 | London\n |  |  |  |  |  |\n\n\n### By region[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Region\n | Titles\n | Runner-up\n | Total\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| South Korea (LCK)\n | 8\n | 6\n | 14\n |\n| China (LPL)\n | 3\n | 4\n | 7\n |\n| EMEA (LEC)\n | 1\n | 3\n | 4\n |\n| Asia-Pacific (PCS)[b] | 1\n | 0\n | 1\n |\n\n\n### By team[edit]\n\n\n*Italics* indicates a team/organization has been disbanded, acquired or no longer participates in the regional league.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Team\n | Region\n | Champions\n | Runners-up\n | Total\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| T1[c] | South Korea (LCK)\n | 4\n | 2\n | 6\n |\n| Gen.G[d] | South Korea (LCK)\n | 2[e] | 1[e] | 3\n |\n| Fnatic | EMEA (LEC)\n | 1\n | 1\n | 2\n |\n| Dplus KIA[f] | South Korea (LCK)\n | 1\n | 1\n | 2\n |\n| Invictus Gaming | China (LPL)\n | 1\n | 0\n | 1\n |\n| J Team[g] | Asia-Pacific (PCS)\n | 1[h] | 0\n | 1\n |\n| FunPlus Phoenix | China (LPL)\n | 1\n | 0\n | 1\n |\n| Edward Gaming | China (LPL)\n | 1\n | 0\n | 1\n |\n| DRX | South Korea (LCK)\n | 1\n | 0\n | 1\n |\n| Royal Never Give Up[i] | China (LPL)\n | 0\n | 2\n | 2\n |\n| Weibo Gaming[j] | China (LPL)\n | 0\n | 2[k] | 2\n |\n| G2 Esports | EMEA (LEC)\n | 0\n | 1\n | 1\n |\n| Hanwha Life Esports[l] | South Korea (LCK)\n | 0\n | 1[m] | 1\n |\n| *against All authority* | EMEA (LEC)\n | 0\n | 1\n | 1\n |\n| *CJ Entus* | South Korea (LCK)\n | 0\n | 1[n] | 1\n |\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The qualifier was available only for Philippines and Singapore.

It marked the ninth final of a *LoL* World Championship and the first time either of the teams had reached the world finals. It was the first time FPX had reached Worlds. FPX were one of three Chinese representatives from the *League of Legends* Pro League at the 2019 Worlds, the others being Royal Never Give Up and Invictus Gaming, the victors of the previous Worlds. G2 Esports were one of three European representatives from the *League of Legends* European Championship alongside Fnatic and Splyce.\n\n\nThe series was a best of five and was played in front of over 15,000 spectators, with more than 40 million concurrent live stream viewers and a total of over 100 million total viewers. The series ended 3–0 in favour of FPX after a dominating performance from all their players.\n\n\nFPX's jungler Gao \"Tian\" Tian-Liang earned the title of Most Valuable Player. The series marked the first international victory for FPX, though they would go on to fail to qualify for the 2020 World Championship.\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\nMain article: League of Legends\n\n![The game's main map. It is a square, with the team bases on the top right and bottom right corners. There are three pathways to each base: one diagonally across the centre, and the others going up and turning at the top left and bottom right corners.](image)A simplified representation of Summoner's Rift. The yellow paths are the \"lanes\" down which minions march; blue and red dots represent turrets. The fountains are the dark areas within each base, and are beside each Nexus. The dotted black line indicates the river.\n*League of Legends* is a 2009 multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game developed by Riot Games.[1] Each year, Riot hosts a World Championship (Worlds) featuring the most successful teams globally throughout the year-long season.[2] The 2019 Worlds, the ninth edition of the World Championship, as with its predecessors, was played on the map \"Summoner's Rift\", a play-field featuring three lanes defined by their location—top, middle, and bottom—and two jungle quadrants, mirrored diagonally down a neutral zone known as the river.[3] Summoner's Rift is played by ten players, five per team,[4] through an isometric perspective as players control characters, known as \"champions\",[5] split between five roles respective on their location on the map: top, jungle, middle, attack damage carry, and support. The latter two are both played in the bottom lane.[6][a] The two teams are referred to as red and blue. The red team spawns in the top right and the blue team spawns in the bottom left.[5]\n\n\nIn professional play, players choose their champions during champion select. This consists of four phases: banning phase and picking phase, both of which occur twice. The blue team starts, banning one champion at their discretion. This is then interchanged between the teams until six total champions have been banned, three per team. Blue side then picks their first champion, followed by red side selecting two champions before blue side completes the first phase of picking and banning by also locking in two champions. The teams then begin the second banning phase, starting with red side. The teams interchange until four additional champions have been banned, for a total of ten. Red side also initiates the second picking phase by selecting one champion. Blue side then responds by picking two champions before red side finalises the process by locking in the final champion.[10]\n\n\nThe ultimate goal of the game is to destroy the enemy team's Nexus.[1] This is accomplished through leveling up and purchasing items with gold, the in-game currency.[4] In the lanes there are turrets and inhibitors, defensive objectives for the opposing team to destroy, as well as a constant stream of minions that can be killed for gold and experience. Similarly, the jungle contains monsters that reward gold and experience upon defeating them.[4] In the river, there are two major neutral objectives. The Rift Herald spawns on the top side of the river and on death, rewards the team with an active item that respawns the Rift Herald, dealing significant damage to the opposing team's defensive structures. At 20 minutes in, the Rift Herald disappears and is replaced by Baron Nashor. Baron Nashor provides the team that kills it with substantial buffs. On the bottom side of the map, dragons spawn.[4] Random elemental dragons that provide small permanent buffs to the acquiring team continue to spawn until 35 minutes in, at which point the Elder Dragon will spawn that upon being slain, provides the team with a powerful temporary buff.[11] Gold and experience points are also obtained through killing these neutral monsters.[4]\n\n\n\n## Route to the final[edit]\n\n\n### G2 Esports[edit]\n\n\nG2 Esports were dominant throughout the entirety of 2019, both domestically and internationally. In their domestic region, the *League of Legends* European Championship (LEC), they would triumph over Origen to win the 2019 Spring Split. The match was a five game series and occurred in the Ahoy Arena in Rotterdam, Netherlands on 13 April 2019 with an attending audience of 15,000, along with livestreams hosted through Twitch.tv and YouTube.[12] G2 won the series 3–0 in under 75 minutes of combined game time. This set an LEC record, beating the former fastest five game series by over half an hour. G2 would also win game three, the final game, in a record 18 minutes 31 seconds.[13] They would ultimately finish the Spring Split with a 13–5 record.[14] G2's victory qualified them for the 2019 Mid-Season Invitational (MSI). An international tournament, they would need to compete against teams from other regions. After reaching the semi-finals, G2 beat the *League of Legends* Champions Korea (LCK) representative SKT T1, a team considered a favourite of the tournament, to reach the finals. The North American League Championship Series representative Team Liquid would be G2's opponent after Team Liquid upset the Chinese *League of Legends* Pro League (LPL) representative Invictus Gaming to reach the finals. G2 beat Team Liquid 3–0 in a best of five. The series was the quickest international best of five in League of Legends history. This victory marked the first time a European team had won the event.[15]\n\n\n\n![](image)The players of G2 Esports lifting the 2019 Mid-Season Invitational trophy. Pictured left to right: Caps, Perkz, Mikyx, Promisq, Wunder, Jankos\nAfter MSI, the LEC 2019 Summer Split commenced. Here, G2 would perform better than in the previous season, ending with a 15–3 record.[14] The team would once again reach the finals, this time facing Fnatic in the Nikos Galis Olympic Indoor Hall in Athens, Greece on 8 September 2019.[16][17] The series would become one of the most viewed esports events of all time, peaking at 850,000 livestream viewers.[16] This finals would prove more difficult for G2 than the Spring Split, with the first game going the way of Fnatic. The series would then ping-pong between the two teams until the scoreline was 2–2. In the final game, G2 would draft a team composition that would be strong in the early game, in order to gain a quick lead and snowball into an early victory. This would prove successful, and G2 would win the series win 3–2. This victory cemented G2 as the European first seed for the 2019 *League of Legends* World Championship and marked their fourth Worlds appearance.[18][19]\n\n\nG2 was seeded into Group A for Worlds alongside Griffin, Cloud9, and Hong Kong Attitude.[19] G2 remained undefeated throughout the group stage until their final game where they would lose against Griffin. This resulting in a tied overall record of 5–1 for G2 and Griffin and in determining the winner of the group, G2 lost the tie-breaker, finishing second in the group.[20] Having progressed into the knockout stage, G2 defeated Damwon Gaming, a representative from the LCK,[21] in the quarterfinals and SKT T1 in the semifinals to reach the 2019 *League of Legends* World Championship Final.[22]\n\n\n\n### FunPlus Phoenix[edit]\n\n\nAfter disappointing performances from FunPlus Phoenix (FPX) in their domestic region, the *League of Legends* Pro League, in 2018, where they ended with records of 9–10 and 8–11 in the Spring and Summer Splits respectively, the team saw major roster changes, as Kim \"Doinb\" Tae-sang replaced the midlaner and Gao \"Tian\" Tian-Liang, previously of Suning, joined as the jungler. These changes would prove successful as they would begin 2019 by achieving a third-place finish in the Spring Split. This split proved useful for building synergies between the team's players. For instance, Doinb developed a playstyle that involved consistently leaving his own lane to roam the map accompanied with Tian and Liu \"Crisp\" Qing-Song, the support, to gank opposing lanes with a significant numbers advantage.[23]\n\n\nIn the Summer Split, FPX displayed dominance, losing only one series all split to Invictus Gaming, the victors of the 2018 *League of Legends* World Championship. The team would face off against Bilibili Gaming in the semi-finals, losing the first game but ending the series 3–1. The same would occur in the finals against Royal Never Give Up, which they would similarly win 3–1 to claim the 2019 Summer Split title. This victory made FPX the first seed for China at the World Championships and marked their first appearance at the World Championship.[23][19]\n\n\nFPX was seeded into Group B for Worlds, alongside J Team, GAM Esports, and Splyce, the lattermost winning their respective play-ins bracket.[19][23] FPX began their Worlds stint by losing to J Team on the first day of groups, however they would then win three games in a row before losing to Splyce. After this loss, they would win one more game before competing in a tiebreaker against Splyce as they had both ended groups with a 4–2 record. FPX would win this game, finishing first in the group.[24][23] Having advanced from groups into the knockout stage, FPX continued to use their signature playstyle and would trump Fnatic in the quarterfinals and Invictus Gaming in the semifinals to reach the finals against G2.[23]\n\n\n\n## Background and pre-series[edit]\n\n\n![](image)AccorHotels Arena in Paris, which was the venue for the final\nG2 Esports were alongside Fnatic in representing the LEC and FPX were alongside Royal Never Give Up and Invictus Gaming, the victors of the previous Worlds, in representing the LPL. This series marked the first time either team had reached the World Finals, despite G2 having made three appearances in past World Championships.[19][25] The Finals were a best of five series, with the first team to win a total of three games being crowned the champions.[26]\n\n\n\n![](image)The opening ceremony incorporated holographic projections to support the live musical performances. The *League of Legends* character Ekko stands on the left hand side.\nThe series was held on 10 November 2019 at AccorHotels Arena in Paris, France for 15,000 spectators.[27] The event was livestreamed via Twitch.tv and YouTube in multiple languages, as well as through the official *LoL Esports* website.[22] Globally, Riot reported that the finals alone reached 44 million concurrent online viewers at its peak, with an estimated total of over 100 million total viewers over the course of the series. This equated to an average minute audience of 21.8 million.[28] Prior to the commencement of the games, Riot held an opening ceremony featuring performances from musical artists that had collaborated with *League of Legends* throughout the year. This began at 13:00 local time (UTC+02:00).[22] The ceremony began with Valerie Broussard performing \"Awaken\",[29] a song released in conjunction with Riot at the start of 2019 to celebrate the beginning of the game's ninth season.[30] This was immediately followed by True Damage, a fictional hip-hop group akin to that of K/DA, featuring Becky G, Keke Palmer, Jeon So-yeon of the K-pop girl group G-Idle, Duckwrth, and Thutmose, performing \"GIANTS\".[31] Finally, the 2019 World Championship promotion song \"Phoenix\" was performed by Cailin Russo and Chrissy Costanza to conclude the opening ceremony.[32] Throughout the ceremony, holographic projections were cast onto the stage to visualise *League of Legends* characters in the real world.[33][34]\n\n\nThe English streams were cast by Chris \"PapaSmithy\" Smith, Trevor \"Quickshot\" Henry, and Sam \"Kobe\" Hartman-Kenzler.[35]\n\n\n\n### Team line-ups[edit]\n\n\nNeither team made any line-up changes going into the finals.[36] FunPlus Phoenix's head coach was Chen \"WarHorse\" Ju-Chih and G2 Esports' head coach was Fabian \"GrabbZ\" Lohmann.[37][38]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Role\n | FunPlus Phoenix\n | G2 Esports\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Top\n | Kim \"GimGoon\" Han-saem\n | Martin \"Wunder\" Hansen |\n| Jungle\n | Gao \"Tian\" Tian-Liang\n | Marcin \"Jankos\" Jankowski\n |\n| Middle\n | Kim \"Doinb\" Tae-sang | Rasmus \"Caps\" Winther |\n| ADC\n | Lin \"Lwx\" Wei-Xiang\n | Luka \"Perkz\" Perkovic |\n| Support\n | Liu \"Crisp\" Qing-Song\n | Mihael \"Mikyx\" Mehle\n |\n| **References:**[36][39][7] |\n\n\n## Series[edit]\n\n\n### Game 1[edit]\n\n\nGame 1 Team Compositions[40]\n| Role\n | FunPlus Phoenix\n | G2 Esports\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Top\n | Gangplank\n | Ryze\n |\n| Jungle\n | Lee Sin\n | Elise\n |\n| Middle\n | Nautilus\n | Pyke\n |\n| ADC\n | Sivir\n | Varus\n |\n| Support\n | Thresh\n | Tahm Kench\n |\n\nThe champion selection phase for the first game commenced shortly after the conclusion of the opening ceremony.

In the first banning phase, FPX opted to ban Syndra, Gragas, and Kai'Sa, while G2 Esports banned Pantheon,[41] a champion that had been banned in every previous game throughout the World Championship;[42] Qiyana; and Xayah.[41] Following the first ban phase, FPX first picked Nautilus, a champion the casters described as a \"flex pick\",[43] or a champion capable of being played in multiple positions.[44] It was ultimately played by Doinb, their midlaner.[45] G2 Esports responded by locking in Varus for Perkz and Ryze for Wunder.[46] For the remaining picks of the first pick phase, FPX chose Lee Sin for Tian and Sivir for LWX, and G2 chose Tahm Kench for Mikyx as their final pick.[47] Before the second pick phase, G2 banned Blitzcrank and Braum and FPX banned and Rek'Sai and Olaf.[48] As G2 were on red side, they got the first pick of the second pick phase, selecting Elise for Jankos. This was followed by Gangplank and Thresh from FPX, for GimGoon and Crisp, respectively, and with G2's last pick, they chose Pyke for Caps.[49]\n\n\nUpon the players loading into the game, it was paused immediately due to technical problems for several minutes.[26] The teams opted to \"split\" the map, meaning both junglers began in the opposing team's jungle.[50] After three minutes of play, the first blood of the match went the way of FPX after GimGoon, assisted by Tian and Doinb, successfully executed a tower dive against Wunder.[51] A few minutes later, Tian took the first drake of the game.[52] Eleven minutes in, the fight involving all ten players erupted when Doinb and Jankos met in the top side river. Crisp was brought very low but avoided death by using a stopwatch (a consumable item that temporarily makes the user invulnerable[53]) when Caps used his ultimate ability. Ultimately, no member of either team died.[54] One minute later Perkz was caught out in the top lane and was killed by LWX.[55] Tian furthered his team's lead in the 14th minute by taking the second drake of the game, though G2 Esports traded it for the Rift Herald as compensation,[56] which they then used to destroy the first tower for additional gold.[57]\n\n\nThe game ended in just under 41 minutes.[40]\n\n\n\n\n### Game 2[edit]\n\n\nGame 2 Team Compositions[58]\n| Role\n | G2 Esports\n | FunPlus Phoenix\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Top\n | Akali\n | Kled\n |\n| Jungle\n | Elise\n | Lee Sin\n |\n| Middle\n | Tristana\n | Ryze\n |\n| ADC\n | Yasuo\n | Kai'Sa\n |\n| Support\n | Gragas\n | Galio\n |\n\nGame 2 ended in 25:38 minutes, with a final kill scoreline of 20-4, in favour of FPX.[58]\n\n\n\n\n### Game 3[edit]\n\n\nGame 3 Team Compositions[59]\n| Role\n | FunPlus Phoenix\n | G2 Esports\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Top\n | Gangplank\n | Ryze\n |\n| Jungle\n | Lee Sin\n | Jarvan IV\n |\n| Middle\n | Galio\n | Veigar\n |\n| ADC\n | Xayah\n | Ezreal\n |\n| Support\n | Thresh\n | Nautilus\n |\n\nG2 took first blood in the third game, but lost in 30:22.[59] FPX would claim the Summoner's Cup in their first World's appearance.[60]\n\n\n\n\n## Post-series[edit]\n\n\nThe tournament had a base prize pool of US$2.225 million. Of this, the winners, FunPlus Phoenix, received 37.5% ($834,375) of the pool. For coming second, G2 was rewarded 13.5% ($300,375).[61] Alongside this, the prize pool is increased through a percentage of the commissions from the year's promotional \"Championship\" skin—a form of virtual cosmetic that modifies the look of the player's champion.[62] Championship skins are given to champions that are seen consistently in the professional leagues and tournaments that year. 2019's Championship skin was given to Ryze, who had a 95.2% presence at the 2019 Mid-Season Invitational.[63] As with previous world champions, FPX worked directly with Riot's visual department to release skins for their chosen champions, with one per player. The skins imitate the team's design, hence FPX's skins include \"a fiery motif, with bird-like masks\".[64] The chosen champions were Gangplank, picked by GimGoon; Lee Sin, picked by Tian; Malphite, picked by Doinb; Vayne, picked by LWX; and Thresh, picked by Crisp.[64] The profits of these skins go in part to the players and their team, as well as to their respective professional league.[62]\n\n\nIn the following season, FPX would fail to qualify for the 2020 *League of Legends* World Championship after an inconsistent year.[65][66] Despite accruing 30 championship points in the LPL Spring Split from finishing third,[67] the team was unable to perform in the Summer Split and were knocked out of contention by Invictus Gaming in the loser's bracket qualifier.[68] In their stead, Top Esports, JD Gaming, LGD Gaming, and Suning represented the Chinese region.[65] G2 Esports would qualify and attend the next year's Worlds representing Europe alongside Fnatic, Rogue, and MAD Lions.[65] G2 would ultimately place third, losing to DAMWON Gaming in the semi-finals. DAMWON Gaming would go on to win the tournament.[69]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The roles in *League of Legends* are often referred to in the community as \"top laner\", \"jungler\", \"midlaner\", \"ADC\" (Attack Damage Carry), and \"support\".[7][8] The latter two are conjunctively known as \"botlaners\".[9]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Blue, Rosario (July 18, 2020). \"League of Legends: a beginner's guide\". *TechRadar*.

The series ended 3–0 in favour of FPX after a dominating performance from all their players.\n\n\nFPX's jungler Gao \"Tian\" Tian-Liang earned the title of Most Valuable Player. The series marked the first international victory for FPX, though they would go on to fail to qualify for the 2020 World Championship.\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\nMain article: League of Legends\n\n![The game's main map. It is a square, with the team bases on the top right and bottom right corners. There are three pathways to each base: one diagonally across the centre, and the others going up and turning at the top left and bottom right corners.](image)A simplified representation of Summoner's Rift. The yellow paths are the \"lanes\" down which minions march; blue and red dots represent turrets. The fountains are the dark areas within each base, and are beside each Nexus. The dotted black line indicates the river.\n*League of Legends* is a 2009 multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game developed by Riot Games.[1] Each year, Riot hosts a World Championship (Worlds) featuring the most successful teams globally throughout the year-long season.[2] The 2019 Worlds, the ninth edition of the World Championship, as with its predecessors, was played on the map \"Summoner's Rift\", a play-field featuring three lanes defined by their location—top, middle, and bottom—and two jungle quadrants, mirrored diagonally down a neutral zone known as the river.[3] Summoner's Rift is played by ten players, five per team,[4] through an isometric perspective as players control characters, known as \"champions\",[5] split between five roles respective on their location on the map: top, jungle, middle, attack damage carry, and support. The latter two are both played in the bottom lane.[6][a] The two teams are referred to as red and blue. The red team spawns in the top right and the blue team spawns in the bottom left.[5]\n\n\nIn professional play, players choose their champions during champion select. This consists of four phases: banning phase and picking phase, both of which occur twice. The blue team starts, banning one champion at their discretion. This is then interchanged between the teams until six total champions have been banned, three per team. Blue side then picks their first champion, followed by red side selecting two champions before blue side completes the first phase of picking and banning by also locking in two champions. The teams then begin the second banning phase, starting with red side. The teams interchange until four additional champions have been banned, for a total of ten. Red side also initiates the second picking phase by selecting one champion. Blue side then responds by picking two champions before red side finalises the process by locking in the final champion.[10]\n\n\nThe ultimate goal of the game is to destroy the enemy team's Nexus.[1] This is accomplished through leveling up and purchasing items with gold, the in-game currency.[4] In the lanes there are turrets and inhibitors, defensive objectives for the opposing team to destroy, as well as a constant stream of minions that can be killed for gold and experience. Similarly, the jungle contains monsters that reward gold and experience upon defeating them.[4] In the river, there are two major neutral objectives. The Rift Herald spawns on the top side of the river and on death, rewards the team with an active item that respawns the Rift Herald, dealing significant damage to the opposing team's defensive structures. At 20 minutes in, the Rift Herald disappears and is replaced by Baron Nashor. Baron Nashor provides the team that kills it with substantial buffs. On the bottom side of the map, dragons spawn.[4] Random elemental dragons that provide small permanent buffs to the acquiring team continue to spawn until 35 minutes in, at which point the Elder Dragon will spawn that upon being slain, provides the team with a powerful temporary buff.[11] Gold and experience points are also obtained through killing these neutral monsters.[4]\n\n\n\n## Route to the final[edit]\n\n\n### G2 Esports[edit]\n\n\nG2 Esports were dominant throughout the entirety of 2019, both domestically and internationally. In their domestic region, the *League of Legends* European Championship (LEC), they would triumph over Origen to win the 2019 Spring Split. The match was a five game series and occurred in the Ahoy Arena in Rotterdam, Netherlands on 13 April 2019 with an attending audience of 15,000, along with livestreams hosted through Twitch.tv and YouTube.[12] G2 won the series 3–0 in under 75 minutes of combined game time. This set an LEC record, beating the former fastest five game series by over half an hour. G2 would also win game three, the final game, in a record 18 minutes 31 seconds.[13] They would ultimately finish the Spring Split with a 13–5 record.[14] G2's victory qualified them for the 2019 Mid-Season Invitational (MSI). An international tournament, they would need to compete against teams from other regions. After reaching the semi-finals, G2 beat the *League of Legends* Champions Korea (LCK) representative SKT T1, a team considered a favourite of the tournament, to reach the finals. The North American League Championship Series representative Team Liquid would be G2's opponent after Team Liquid upset the Chinese *League of Legends* Pro League (LPL) representative Invictus Gaming to reach the finals. G2 beat Team Liquid 3–0 in a best of five. The series was the quickest international best of five in League of Legends history. This victory marked the first time a European team had won the event.[15]\n\n\n\n![](image)The players of G2 Esports lifting the 2019 Mid-Season Invitational trophy. Pictured left to right: Caps, Perkz, Mikyx, Promisq, Wunder, Jankos\nAfter MSI, the LEC 2019 Summer Split commenced. Here, G2 would perform better than in the previous season, ending with a 15–3 record.[14] The team would once again reach the finals, this time facing Fnatic in the Nikos Galis Olympic Indoor Hall in Athens, Greece on 8 September 2019.[16][17] The series would become one of the most viewed esports events of all time, peaking at 850,000 livestream viewers.[16] This finals would prove more difficult for G2 than the Spring Split, with the first game going the way of Fnatic. The series would then ping-pong between the two teams until the scoreline was 2–2. In the final game, G2 would draft a team composition that would be strong in the early game, in order to gain a quick lead and snowball into an early victory. This would prove successful, and G2 would win the series win 3–2. This victory cemented G2 as the European first seed for the 2019 *League of Legends* World Championship and marked their fourth Worlds appearance.[18][19]\n\n\nG2 was seeded into Group A for Worlds alongside Griffin, Cloud9, and Hong Kong Attitude.[19] G2 remained undefeated throughout the group stage until their final game where they would lose against Griffin. This resulting in a tied overall record of 5–1 for G2 and Griffin and in determining the winner of the group, G2 lost the tie-breaker, finishing second in the group.[20] Having progressed into the knockout stage, G2 defeated Damwon Gaming, a representative from the LCK,[21] in the quarterfinals and SKT T1 in the semifinals to reach the 2019 *League of Legends* World Championship Final.[22]\n\n\n\n### FunPlus Phoenix[edit]\n\n\nAfter disappointing performances from FunPlus Phoenix (FPX) in their domestic region, the *League of Legends* Pro League, in 2018, where they ended with records of 9–10 and 8–11 in the Spring and Summer Splits respectively, the team saw major roster changes, as Kim \"Doinb\" Tae-sang replaced the midlaner and Gao \"Tian\" Tian-Liang, previously of Suning, joined as the jungler. These changes would prove successful as they would begin 2019 by achieving a third-place finish in the Spring Split. This split proved useful for building synergies between the team's players. For instance, Doinb developed a playstyle that involved consistently leaving his own lane to roam the map accompanied with Tian and Liu \"Crisp\" Qing-Song, the support, to gank opposing lanes with a significant numbers advantage.[23]\n\n\nIn the Summer Split, FPX displayed dominance, losing only one series all split to Invictus Gaming, the victors of the 2018 *League of Legends* World Championship. The team would face off against Bilibili Gaming in the semi-finals, losing the first game but ending the series 3–1. The same would occur in the finals against Royal Never Give Up, which they would similarly win 3–1 to claim the 2019 Summer Split title. This victory made FPX the first seed for China at the World Championships and marked their first appearance at the World Championship.[23][19]\n\n\nFPX was seeded into Group B for Worlds, alongside J Team, GAM Esports, and Splyce, the lattermost winning their respective play-ins bracket.[19][23] FPX began their Worlds stint by losing to J Team on the first day of groups, however they would then win three games in a row before losing to Splyce. After this loss, they would win one more game before competing in a tiebreaker against Splyce as they had both ended groups with a 4–2 record. FPX would win this game, finishing first in the group.[24][23] Having advanced from groups into the knockout stage, FPX continued to use their signature playstyle and would trump Fnatic in the quarterfinals and Invictus Gaming in the semifinals to reach the finals against G2.[23]\n\n\n\n## Background and pre-series[edit]\n\n\n![](image)AccorHotels Arena in Paris, which was the venue for the final\nG2 Esports were alongside Fnatic in representing the LEC and FPX were alongside Royal Never Give Up and Invictus Gaming, the victors of the previous Worlds, in representing the LPL. This series marked the first time either team had reached the World Finals, despite G2 having made three appearances in past World Championships.[19][25] The Finals were a best of five series, with the first team to win a total of three games being crowned the champions.[26]\n\n\n\n![](image)The opening ceremony incorporated holographic projections to support the live musical performances. The *League of Legends* character Ekko stands on the left hand side.\nThe series was held on 10 November 2019 at AccorHotels Arena in Paris, France for 15,000 spectators.[27] The event was livestreamed via Twitch.tv and YouTube in multiple languages, as well as through the official *LoL Esports* website.[22] Globally, Riot reported that the finals alone reached 44 million concurrent online viewers at its peak, with an estimated total of over 100 million total viewers over the course of the series. This equated to an average minute audience of 21.8 million.[28] Prior to the commencement of the games, Riot held an opening ceremony featuring performances from musical artists that had collaborated with *League of Legends* throughout the year. This began at 13:00 local time (UTC+02:00).[22] The ceremony began with Valerie Broussard performing \"Awaken\",[29] a song released in conjunction with Riot at the start of 2019 to celebrate the beginning of the game's ninth season.[30] This was immediately followed by True Damage, a fictional hip-hop group akin to that of K/DA, featuring Becky G, Keke Palmer, Jeon So-yeon of the K-pop girl group G-Idle, Duckwrth, and Thutmose, performing \"GIANTS\".[31] Finally, the 2019 World Championship promotion song \"Phoenix\" was performed by Cailin Russo and Chrissy Costanza to conclude the opening ceremony.[32] Throughout the ceremony, holographic projections were cast onto the stage to visualise *League of Legends* characters in the real world.[33][34]\n\n\nThe English streams were cast by Chris \"PapaSmithy\" Smith, Trevor \"Quickshot\" Henry, and Sam \"Kobe\" Hartman-Kenzler.[35]\n\n\n\n### Team line-ups[edit]\n\n\nNeither team made any line-up changes going into the finals.[36] FunPlus Phoenix's head coach was Chen \"WarHorse\" Ju-Chih and G2 Esports' head coach was Fabian \"GrabbZ\" Lohmann.[37][38]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Role\n | FunPlus Phoenix\n | G2 Esports\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Top\n | Kim \"GimGoon\" Han-saem\n | Martin \"Wunder\" Hansen |\n| Jungle\n | Gao \"Tian\" Tian-Liang\n | Marcin \"Jankos\" Jankowski\n |\n| Middle\n | Kim \"Doinb\" Tae-sang | Rasmus \"Caps\" Winther |\n| ADC\n | Lin \"Lwx\" Wei-Xiang\n | Luka \"Perkz\" Perkovic |\n| Support\n | Liu \"Crisp\" Qing-Song\n | Mihael \"Mikyx\" Mehle\n |\n| **References:**[36][39][7] |\n\n\n## Series[edit]\n\n\n### Game 1[edit]\n\n\nGame 1 Team Compositions[40]\n| Role\n | FunPlus Phoenix\n | G2 Esports\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Top\n | Gangplank\n | Ryze\n |\n| Jungle\n | Lee Sin\n | Elise\n |\n| Middle\n | Nautilus\n | Pyke\n |\n| ADC\n | Sivir\n | Varus\n |\n| Support\n | Thresh\n | Tahm Kench\n |\n\nThe champion selection phase for the first game commenced shortly after the conclusion of the opening ceremony. FPX were on blue side which gave them the opportunity to ban and pick the first champions of the game. In the first banning phase, FPX opted to ban Syndra, Gragas, and Kai'Sa, while G2 Esports banned Pantheon,[41] a champion that had been banned in every previous game throughout the World Championship;[42] Qiyana; and Xayah.[41] Following the first ban phase, FPX first picked Nautilus, a champion the casters described as a \"flex pick\",[43] or a champion capable of being played in multiple positions.[44] It was ultimately played by Doinb, their midlaner.[45] G2 Esports responded by locking in Varus for Perkz and Ryze for Wunder.[46] For the remaining picks of the first pick phase, FPX chose Lee Sin for Tian and Sivir for LWX, and G2 chose Tahm Kench for Mikyx as their final pick.[47] Before the second pick phase, G2 banned Blitzcrank and Braum and FPX banned and Rek'Sai and Olaf.[48] As G2 were on red side, they got the first pick of the second pick phase, selecting Elise for Jankos. This was followed by Gangplank and Thresh from FPX, for GimGoon and Crisp, respectively, and with G2's last pick, they chose Pyke for Caps.[49]\n\n\nUpon the players loading into the game, it was paused immediately due to technical problems for several minutes.[26] The teams opted to \"split\" the map, meaning both junglers began in the opposing team's jungle.[50] After three minutes of play, the first blood of the match went the way of FPX after GimGoon, assisted by Tian and Doinb, successfully executed a tower dive against Wunder.[51] A few minutes later, Tian took the first drake of the game.[52] Eleven minutes in, the fight involving all ten players erupted when Doinb and Jankos met in the top side river. Crisp was brought very low but avoided death by using a stopwatch (a consumable item that temporarily makes the user invulnerable[53]) when Caps used his ultimate ability. Ultimately, no member of either team died.[54] One minute later Perkz was caught out in the top lane and was killed by LWX.[55] Tian furthered his team's lead in the 14th minute by taking the second drake of the game, though G2 Esports traded it for the Rift Herald as compensation,[56] which they then used to destroy the first tower for additional gold.[57]\n\n\nThe game ended in just under 41 minutes.[40]\n\n\n\n\n### Game 2[edit]\n\n\nGame 2 Team Compositions[58]\n| Role\n | G2 Esports\n | FunPlus Phoenix\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Top\n | Akali\n | Kled\n |\n| Jungle\n | Elise\n | Lee Sin\n |\n| Middle\n | Tristana\n | Ryze\n |\n| ADC\n | Yasuo\n | Kai'Sa\n |\n| Support\n | Gragas\n | Galio\n |\n\nGame 2 ended in 25:38 minutes, with a final kill scoreline of 20-4, in favour of FPX.[58]\n\n\n\n\n### Game 3[edit]\n\n\nGame 3 Team Compositions[59]\n| Role\n | FunPlus Phoenix\n | G2 Esports\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Top\n | Gangplank\n | Ryze\n |\n| Jungle\n | Lee Sin\n | Jarvan IV\n |\n| Middle\n | Galio\n | Veigar\n |\n| ADC\n | Xayah\n | Ezreal\n |\n| Support\n | Thresh\n | Nautilus\n |\n\nG2 took first blood in the third game, but lost in 30:22.[59] FPX would claim the Summoner's Cup in their first World's appearance.[60]\n\n\n\n\n## Post-series[edit]\n\n\nThe tournament had a base prize pool of US$2.225 million. Of this, the winners, FunPlus Phoenix, received 37.5% ($834,375) of the pool. For coming second, G2 was rewarded 13.5% ($300,375).[61] Alongside this, the prize pool is increased through a percentage of the commissions from the year's promotional \"Championship\" skin—a form of virtual cosmetic that modifies the look of the player's champion.[62] Championship skins are given to champions that are seen consistently in the professional leagues and tournaments that year. 2019's Championship skin was given to Ryze, who had a 95.2% presence at the 2019 Mid-Season Invitational.[63] As with previous world champions, FPX worked directly with Riot's visual department to release skins for their chosen champions, with one per player. The skins imitate the team's design, hence FPX's skins include \"a fiery motif, with bird-like masks\".[64] The chosen champions were Gangplank, picked by GimGoon; Lee Sin, picked by Tian; Malphite, picked by Doinb; Vayne, picked by LWX; and Thresh, picked by Crisp.[64] The profits of these skins go in part to the players and their team, as well as to their respective professional league.[62]\n\n\nIn the following season, FPX would fail to qualify for the 2020 *League of Legends* World Championship after an inconsistent year.[65][66] Despite accruing 30 championship points in the LPL Spring Split from finishing third,[67] the team was unable to perform in the Summer Split and were knocked out of contention by Invictus Gaming in the loser's bracket qualifier.[68] In their stead, Top Esports, JD Gaming, LGD Gaming, and Suning represented the Chinese region.[65] G2 Esports would qualify and attend the next year's Worlds representing Europe alongside Fnatic, Rogue, and MAD Lions.[65] G2 would ultimately place third, losing to DAMWON Gaming in the semi-finals. DAMWON Gaming would go on to win the tournament.[69]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The roles in *League of Legends* are often referred to in the community as \"top laner\", \"jungler\", \"midlaner\", \"ADC\" (Attack Damage Carry), and \"support\".[7][8] The latter two are conjunctively known as \"botlaners\".[9]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Blue, Rosario (July 18, 2020). \"League of Legends: a beginner's guide\". *TechRadar*.
