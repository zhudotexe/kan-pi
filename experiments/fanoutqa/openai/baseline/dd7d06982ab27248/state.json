It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the 1895 will of Alfred Nobel, which are awarded for outstanding contributions in chemistry, physics, literature, peace, and physiology or medicine.[1] As dictated by Nobel's will, the award is administered by the Nobel Foundation and awarded by the Swedish Academy.[2] The first Nobel Prize in Literature was awarded in 1901 to Sully Prudhomme of France.[3] Each recipient receives a medal, a diploma and a monetary award prize that has varied throughout the years.[4] In 1901, Prudhomme received 150,782 SEK, which is equivalent to 8,823,637.78 SEK in January 2018. The award is presented in Stockholm at an annual ceremony on December 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death.[5]\n\n\nAs of 2022, the Nobel Prize in Literature has been awarded to 119 individuals.[6] The youngest laureate was Rudyard Kipling, who was 41 years old when he was awarded in 1907. The oldest laureate to receive the prize was Doris Lessing, who was 88 when she was awarded in 2007. It has been awarded posthumously once, to Erik Axel Karlfeldt in 1931.[7] When he received the award in 1958, Russian-born Boris Pasternak was forced to publicly reject the award under pressure from the government of the Soviet Union. In 1964, Jean-Paul Sartre made known that he did not wish to accept the Nobel Prize in Literature,[8] as he had consistently refused all official honors in the past.[9] However the Nobel committee does not acknowledge refusals, and includes Pasternak and Sartre in its list of Nobel laureates.[10]\n\n\nSeventeen women have been awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, the second highest number of any of the Nobel Prizes behind the Nobel Peace Prize.[11][12] There have been four instances in which the award was given to two people (1904, 1917, 1966, 1974). There have been seven years in which the Nobel Prize in Literature was not awarded (1914, 1918, 1935, 1940\u20131943). There have been three years for which the Nobel Prize in Literature was delayed one year: the prizes for 1915,[13] 1949[14] and 2018[15][16][6] were each awarded together with that of the following year in October of the following year. As of 2022, there have been 29 English-speaking laureates of the Nobel Prize in Literature, followed by French with 16 laureates and German with 14 laureates. France has the highest number of Nobel laureates.\n\n\n\n\n## Laureates[edit]\n\n\n* 1901\n* 1910\n* 1920\n* 1930\n* 1940\n* 1950\n* 1960\n* 1970\n* 1980\n* 1990\n* 2000\n* 2010\n* 2020\n\n\n\n|

The Swedish Academy decides who, if anyone, will receive the prize. The academy announces the name of the laureate in early October. It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the will of Alfred Nobel in 1895. Literature is traditionally the final award presented at the Nobel Prize ceremony. On some occasions, the award has been postponed to the following year, most recently in 2018 as of July 2023.[4][5][6]\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\n![](image)In 1901, French poet and essayist Sully Prudhomme (1839\u20131907) was the first person to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, \"in special recognition of his poetic composition, which gives evidence of lofty idealism, artistic perfection, and a rare combination of the qualities of both heart and intellect.\"\nAlfred Nobel stipulated in his last will and testament that his money be used to create a series of prizes for those who confer the \"greatest benefit on mankind\" in physics, chemistry, peace, physiology or medicine, and literature.[7][8] Although Nobel wrote several wills during his lifetime, the last was written a little over a year before he died, and it was signed at the Swedish-Norwegian Club in Paris on 27 November 1895.[9][10] Nobel bequeathed 94% of his total assets, 31\u00a0million Swedish *kronor* (US$198\u00a0million, \u20ac176\u00a0million in 2016), to establish and endow the five Nobel Prizes.[11] Due to the level of scepticism surrounding the will, it was not until 26 April 1897 that the Storting (Norwegian Parliament) approved it.[12][13] The executors of his will were Ragnar Sohlman and Rudolf Lilljequist, who formed the Nobel Foundation to take care of Nobel's fortune and organise the prizes.\n\n\nThe members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee that were to award the Peace Prize were appointed shortly after the will was approved. The prize-awarding organisations followed: the Karolinska Institutet on 7 June, the Swedish Academy on 9 June, and the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences on 11 June.[14][15] The Nobel Foundation then reached an agreement on guidelines for how the Nobel Prize should be awarded. In 1900, the Nobel Foundation's newly created statutes were promulgated by King Oscar II.[13][16][17] According to Nobel's will, the prize in literature should be determined by \"the Academy in Stockholm\", which was specified by the statutes of the Nobel Foundation to mean the Swedish Academy.[18]\n\n\n\n## Nomination and award procedure[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of nominees for the Nobel Prize in Literature.\n\nEach year, the Swedish Academy sends out requests for nominations of candidates for the Nobel Prize in Literature. Members of the Academy, members of literature academies and societies, professors of literature and language, former Nobel literature laureates, and the presidents of writers' organisations are all allowed to nominate a candidate. It is not allowed to nominate oneself.[19]\n\n\nThousands of requests are sent out each year, and as of 2011[update] about 220 proposals were returned.[20] These proposals must be received by the Academy by 1 February, after which they are examined by the Nobel Committee, a working group within the Academy comprising four to five members.[21] By April, the committee narrows the field to around 20 candidates.[20] By May, a shortlist of five names is approved by the Academy.[20] The next four months are spent reading and reviewing the works of the five candidates.[20] In October, members of the Academy vote, and the candidate who receives more than half of the votes is named the Nobel laureate in Literature. No one can get the prize without being on the list at least twice; thus, many authors reappear and are reviewed repeatedly over the years.[20] The academicians read works in their original language, but when a candidate is shortlisted from a language that no member masters, they call on translators and oath-sworn experts to provide samples of that writer's work.[20] Other elements of the process are similar to those of other Nobel Prizes.[21] The Swedish Academy is composed of 18 members who are elected for life and, until 2018, not technically permitted to leave.[22] On 2 May 2018, King Carl XVI Gustaf amended the rules of the academy and made it possible for members to resign. The new rules also mention that a member who has been inactive in the work of the academy for more than two years can be asked to resign.[23][24] The members of the Nobel committee are elected for a period of three years from among the members of the academy and are assisted by specially appointed expert advisers.[25]\n\n\nThe award is usually announced in October. Sometimes, however, the award has been announced the year after the nominal year, the latest such case being the 2018 award. In the midst of controversy surrounding claims of sexual assault, conflict of interest, and resignations by officials, on 4 May 2018, the Swedish Academy announced that the 2018 laureate would be announced in 2019 along with the 2019 laureate.[5][4] Some years, such as in 1949, no candidate received the required majority of the votes, and for that reason, the prize was postponed and announced the following year.[26]\n\n\n\n## Prizes[edit]\n\n\nA Literature Nobel Prize laureate receives a gold medal, a diploma bearing a citation, and a sum of money.[27] The amount of money awarded depends on the income of the Nobel Foundation that year.[28] The literature prize can be shared between two, but not three, laureates.[29] If a prize is awarded jointly, the prize money is split equally between them.[30]\n\n\nThe prize money of the Nobel Prize has been fluctuating since its inauguration but as of 2012[update] it stood at kr\u00a08,000,000 (about US$1,100,000), previously it was kr\u00a010,000,000.[31][32][33] This was not the first time the prize amount was decreased\u2014beginning with a nominal value of kr\u00a0150,782 in 1901 (worth 8,123,951 in 2011 SKr) the nominal value has been as low as kr\u00a0121,333 (2,370,660 in 2011 SKr) in 1945\u2014but it has been uphill or stable since then, peaking at an SKr-2011 value of 11,659,016 in 2001.[33]\n\n\nThe laureate is also invited to give a lecture during \"Nobel Week\" in Stockholm; the highlight is the prize-giving ceremony and banquet on 10 December.[34] It is the second richest literary prize in the world.\n\n\n\n### Medals[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Nobel Prize medal \u00a7\u00a0Literature\n\nThe literature medal features a portrait of Alfred Nobel in left profile on the obverse.[35] It was designed by Erik Lindberg.[35] The reverse of the medal depicts a '... young man sitting under a laurel tree who, enchanted, listens to and writes down the song of the Muse'.[36][35] It is inscribed \"*Inventas vitam iuvat excoluisse per artes*\" (\"It is beneficial to have improved (human) life through discovered arts\"), an adaptation of \"*inventas aut qui vitam excoluere per artes*\" from line 663 of book 6 of the *Aeneid* by the Roman poet Virgil.[36] A plate below the figures is inscribed with the name of the recipient. The text \"ACAD. SUEC.\" denoting the Swedish Academy is also inscribed on the reverse.[36]\n\n\nBetween 1902 and 2010, the Nobel Prize medals were struck by the Myntverket, the Swedish royal mint, located in Eskilstuna. In 2011, the medals were made by the Det Norske Myntverket in Kongsberg. The medals have been made by Svenska Medalj in Eskilstuna since 2012.[35]\n\n\n\n### Diplomas[edit]\n\n\nNobel laureates receive a diploma directly from the King of Sweden. Each diploma is uniquely designed by the prize-awarding institutions for the laureate who receives it.[37] The diploma contains a picture and text that states the name of the laureate and normally a citation of why they received the prize.[37]\n\n\n\n## Laureates[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of Nobel laureates in Literature.\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Literature has been awarded 116 times between 1901 and 2023 to 120 individuals: 103 men and 17 women. The prize has been shared between two individuals on four occasions. It was not awarded on seven occasions. The laureates have included writers in 25 different languages. The youngest laureate was Rudyard Kipling, who was 41 years old when he was awarded in 1907. The oldest laureate to receive the prize was Doris Lessing, who was 88 when she was awarded in 2007. It has been awarded posthumously once, to Erik Axel Karlfeldt in 1931. On some occasions, the awarding institution, the Swedish Academy, has awarded the prize to its own members; Verner von Heidenstam in 1916, the posthumous prize to Karlfeldt in 1931, P\u00e4r Lagerkvist in 1951, and the shared prize to Eyvind Johnson and Harry Martinson in 1974. Selma Lagerl\u00f6f was elected a member of the Swedish Academy in 1914, five years after she was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1909. Two writers have declined the prize, Boris Pasternak in 1958 (\"Accepted first, later caused by the authorities of his country (Soviet Union) to decline the Prize\", according to the Nobel Foundation) and Jean-Paul Sartre in 1964. [38]\n\n\n\n### Interpretations of Nobel's guidelines[edit]\n\n\nAlfred Nobel's guidelines for the prize, stating that the candidate should have bestowed \"the greatest benefit on mankind\" and written \"in an idealistic direction,\" have sparked much discussion. In the early history of the prize, Nobel's \"idealism\" was read as \"a lofty and sound idealism.\" The set of criteria, characterised by its conservative idealism, holding church, state, and family sacred, resulted in prizes for Bj\u00f8rnstjerne Bj\u00f8rnson, Rudyard Kipling, and Paul Heyse. During World War I, there was a policy of neutrality, which partly explains the number of awards to Scandinavian writers. In the 1920s, \"idealistic direction\" was interpreted more generously as \"wide-hearted humanity,\" leading to awards for writers like Anatole France, George Bernard Shaw, and Thomas Mann. In the 1930s, \"the greatest benefit on mankind\" was interpreted as writers within everybody's reach, with authors like Sinclair Lewis and Pearl Buck receiving recognition. From 1946, a renewed Academy changed focus and began to award literary pioneers like Hermann Hesse, Andr\u00e9 Gide, T. S. Eliot, and William Faulkner. During this era, \"the greatest benefit on mankind\" was interpreted in a more exclusive and generous way than before. Since the 1970s, the Academy has often given attention to important but internationally unnoticed writers, awarding writers like Isaac Bashevis Singer, Odysseus Elytis, Elias Canetti, and Jaroslav Seifert.\n\n\nFrom 1986, the Academy acknowledged the international horizon in Nobel's will, which rejected any consideration of the nationality of the candidates, and awarded authors from all over the world, such as Wole Soyinka from Nigeria, Naguib Mahfouz from Egypt, Octavio Paz from Mexico, Nadine Gordimer from South Africa, Derek Walcott from St. Lucia, Toni Morrison, the first African-American on the list, Kenzaburo Oe from Japan, and Gao Xingjian, the first laureate to write in Chinese.[18] In the 2000s, V. S. Naipaul, Mario Vargas Llosa, and the Chinese writer Mo Yan have been awarded, but the policy of \"a prize for the whole world\" has been less noticeable as the Academy has mostly awarded European and English-language writers from the Western literary tradition. In 2015, a rare prize to a non-fiction writer was awarded to Svetlana Alexievich.[39]\n\n\n\n### Shared prize[edit]\n\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Literature can be shared between two individuals. However, the Academy has been reluctant to award shared prizes, mainly because divisions are liable to be interpreted as a result of a compromise. The shared prizes awarded to Frederic Mistral and Jos\u00e9 Echegaray in 1904 and to Karl Gjellerup and Henrik Pontoppidan in 1917 were, in fact, both results of compromises. The Academy has also hesitated to divide the prize between two authors, as a shared prize runs the risk of being regarded as only half a laurel. Shared prizes are exceptional, and more recently, the Academy has awarded a shared prize on only two occasions, to Shmuel Yosef Agnon and Nelly Sachs in 1966, and to Eyvind Johnson and Harry Martinson in 1974.[18]\n\n\n\n### Recognition of a specific work[edit]\n\n\nNobel Prize Laureates in Literature are awarded for the author's life work, but on some occasions, the Academy has singled out a specific work for particular recognition. For example, Knut Hamsun was awarded in 1920 \"for his monumental work, *Growth of the Soil*,\" Thomas Mann in 1929 \"principally for his great novel, *Buddenbrooks*, which has won steadily increased recognition as one of the classic works of contemporary literature,\" John Galsworthy in 1932 \"for his distinguished art of narration which takes its highest form in *The Forsyte Saga*,\" Roger Martin du Gard in 1937 \"for the artistic power and truth with which he has depicted human conflict as well as some fundamental aspects of contemporary life in his novel-cycle *Les Thibault',\" Ernest Hemingway in 1954 \"for his mastery of the art of narrative, most recently demonstrated in* The Old Man and the Sea*, and for the influence that he has exerted on contemporary style,\" and Mikhail Sholokhov in 1965 \"for the artistic power and integrity with which, in his epic of the Don, he has given expression to a historic phase in the life of the Russian people\".[38]*\n\n\n\n### Potential candidates[edit]\n\n\nNominations are kept secret for fifty years until they are publicly available at The Nomination Database for the Nobel Prize in Literature. Currently, only nominations submitted between 1901 and 1971 are available for public viewing.[40]\n\n\n\n\n> What about the rumours circling around the world about certain people being nominated for the Nobel Prize this year? \u2013 Well, either it's just a rumour, or someone among the invited nominators has leaked information. Since the nominations are kept secret for 50 years, you'll have to wait until then to find out.[41]\n> \n> \n> \u2014\u200ain Nomination FAQ \u2013 Frequently Asked Questions about the Nomination and Selection of Nobel Laureates\n> \n\n\n## Criticism[edit]\n\n\nAlthough the Nobel Prize in Literature has become the world's most prestigious literature prize,[42] the Swedish Academy has attracted significant criticism for its handling of the award. Many authors who have won the prize have fallen into obscurity, while others rejected by the jury remain widely studied and read. In the *Wall Street Journal*, Joseph Epstein wrote, \"You might not know it, but you and I are members of a club whose fellow members include Leo Tolstoy, Henry James, Anton Chekhov, Mark Twain, Henrik Ibsen, Marcel Proust, James Joyce, Jorge Luis Borges and Vladimir Nabokov. The club is the Non-Winners of the Nobel Prize in Literature. All these authentically great writers, still alive when the prize, initiated in 1901, was being awarded, didn't win it.\"[43] Other notable names from the non-western canon who were ignored despite being nominated several times for the prize include Sri Aurobindo and Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan. The prize has \"become widely seen as a political one \u2013 a peace prize in literary disguise\", whose judges are prejudiced against authors with political tastes different from theirs.[44] Tim Parks has expressed skepticism that it is possible for \"Swedish professors ... [to] compar[e] a poet from Indonesia, perhaps translated into English with a novelist from Cameroon, perhaps available only in French, and another who writes in Afrikaans but is published in German and Dutch...\".[45] As of 2021, 16 of the 118 recipients have been of Scandinavian origin. The Academy has often been alleged to be biased towards European, and in particular Swedish, authors.[46]\n\n\nNobel's \"vague\" wording for the criteria for the prize has led to recurrent controversy. In the original Swedish, the word *idealisk* translates as \"ideal.\"[3][47] The Nobel Committee's interpretation has varied over the years. In recent years, this means a kind of idealism championing human rights on a broad scale.[3][48]\n\n\n\n### Controversies about Nobel laureate selections[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Nobel Prize controversies \u00a7\u00a0Literature\n\nFrom 1901 to 1912, the committee, led by the conservative Carl David af Wirs\u00e9n, assessed the literary quality of a work in relation to its contribution to humanity's pursuit of the \"ideal.\" Leo Tolstoy, Henrik Ibsen, \u00c9mile Zola, and Mark Twain were rejected in favour of authors who are little read today.[47][49]\n\n\nLater, the prize has often been controversial due to the Swedish Academy's Eurocentric choices of laureates for political reasons, as seen in the years 1970, 2005, and 2019, and for the Academy awarding its own members, as happened in 1974.[50]\n\n\n\n### Nationality-based criticism[edit]\n\n\n![](image)French author Albert Camus was the first African-born writer to receive the award.\nThe prize's focus on European men, and Swedes in particular, has been the subject of criticism, even from Swedish newspapers.[51] The majority of laureates have been European, with Sweden itself receiving more prizes (8) than all of Asia (7, if Turkish Orhan Pamuk is included), as well as all of Latin America (7, if Saint Lucian Derek Walcott is included). In 2009, Horace Engdahl, then the permanent secretary of the Academy, declared that \"Europe still is the centre of the literary world\" and that \"the US is too isolated, too insular. They don't translate enough and don't really participate in the big dialogue of literature.\"[52]\n\n\nIn 2009, Engdahl's replacement, Peter Englund, rejected this sentiment (\"In most language areas ... there are authors that really deserve and could get the Nobel Prize and that goes for the United States and the Americas, as well\") and acknowledged the Eurocentric nature of the award, saying that, \"I think that is a problem. We tend to relate more easily to literature written in Europe and in the European tradition.\"[53] American critics are known to object that those from their own country, like Philip Roth, Thomas Pynchon, and Cormac McCarthy, have been overlooked, as have Latin Americans such as Jorge Luis Borges, Julio Cort\u00e1zar, and Carlos Fuentes, while in their place Europeans lesser-known to that continent have triumphed. The 2009 award to Herta M\u00fcller, previously little-known outside Germany but many times named favourite for the Nobel Prize, re-ignited the viewpoint that the Swedish Academy was biased and Eurocentric.[54]\n\n\nThe 2010 prize was awarded to Mario Vargas Llosa, a native of Peru in South America, a generally well-regarded decision. When the 2011 prize was awarded to the Swedish poet Tomas Transtr\u00f6mer, permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy Peter Englund said the prize was not decided based on politics, describing such a notion as \"literature for dummies.\"[55] The Swedish Academy awarded the next two prizes to non-Europeans, Chinese author Mo Yan and Canadian short story writer Alice Munro. French writer Patrick Modiano's win in 2014 renewed questions of Eurocentrism; when asked by *The Wall Street Journal* \"So no American this year, yet again. Why is that?\", Englund reminded Americans of the Canadian origins of the previous year's recipient, the Academy's desire for literary quality and the impossibility of rewarding everyone who deserves the prize.[56]\n\n\n\n### Overlooked literary achievements[edit]\n\n\nIn the history of the Nobel Prize in Literature, many critical literary figures were ignored. The literary historian Kjell Espmark admitted that \"as to the early prizes, the censure of bad choices and blatant omissions is often justified. Tolstoy, Ibsen, and Henry James should have been rewarded instead of, for instance, Sully Prudhomme, Eucken, and Heyse.\"[57] There are omissions which are beyond the control of the Nobel Committee such as the early death of an author as was the case with Marcel Proust, Italo Calvino, and Roberto Bola\u00f1o. According to Kjell Espmark, \"the main works of Kafka, Cavafy, and Pessoa were not published until after their deaths, and the true dimensions of Mandelstam's poetry were revealed above all in the unpublished poems that his wife saved from extinction and gave to the world long after he had perished in his Siberian exile.\"[57] British novelist Tim Parks ascribed the never-ending controversy surrounding the decisions of the Nobel Committee to the \"essential silliness of the prize and our own foolishness at taking it seriously\"[58] and noted that \"eighteen (or sixteen) Swedish nationals will have a certain credibility when weighing up works of Swedish literature, but what group could ever really get its mind round the infinitely varied work of scores of different traditions. And why should we ask them to do that?\"[58]\n\n\nAlthough several Scandinavians were awarded, two of the most celebrated writers, Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen and Swedish author August Strindberg, were repeatedly bypassed by the committee, but Strindberg holds the singular distinction of being awarded an Anti-Nobel Prize, conferred by popular acclaim and national subscription and presented to him in 1912 by future prime minister Hjalmar Branting.[59][60][61]\n\n\nPaul Val\u00e9ry was nominated twelve times between 1930 and 1945 but died just as the Academy intended to award him the prize in 1945.[62][63]\n\n\nJames Joyce wrote the books that rank 1st and 3rd on the Modern Library 100 Best Novels \u2013 *Ulysses* and *Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man* \u2013 but Joyce was never nominated for the prize. Kjell Espmark, a member of the Nobel Prize committee and author of the history of the prize, claimed that Joyce's \"stature was not properly recognized even in the English-speaking world,\" but that Joyce doubtless would have been awarded if he had lived in the late 1940s when the Academy began to award literary pioneers like T. S. Eliot.[64]\n\n\nArgentine writer Jorge Luis Borges was nominated for the prize several times, but the Academy did not award it to him, though he was among the final candidates some years in the 1960s.[65]\n\n\nGraham Greene was nominated for the prize twenty times between the years 1950 and 1966.[66] Greene was a celebrated candidate to be awarded the prize in the 1960s and 1970s, and the Academy was criticised for passing him over.[18]\n\n\nFrench novelist and intellectual Andr\u00e9 Malraux was seriously considered for the prize in the 1950s. Malraux was competing with Albert Camus but was rejected several times, especially in 1954 and 1955, \"so long as he does not come back to novel.\" Thus, Camus was awarded the prize in 1957.[67] Malraux was again considered in 1969 when he was competing with Samuel Beckett for the prize. Some members of the Nobel committee supported a prize to Malraux, but Beckett was awarded.[68]\n\n\nW. H. Auden was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature ten times in the 1960s[69] and was among the final candidates for the prize several times, but the Academy favoured other writers. In 1964 Auden and Jean-Paul Sartre were the leading candidates, and the Academy favoured Sartre as Auden's best work was thought \"too far back in time.\" In 1967 Auden was one of three final candidates along with Graham Greene and the awarded Guatemalan author Miguel \u00c1ngel Asturias.[70][71]\n\n\n\n### Controversies about Swedish Academy board members[edit]\n\n\nMembership in the 18-member academy, who select the recipients, is technically for life.[22] Until 2018, members were not allowed to leave, although they might refuse to participate.[22] For members who did not participate, their board seat was left vacant until they died.[72] Twelve active/participating members are required for a quorum.[72]\n\n\nIn 1989, three members, including the former permanent secretary Lars Gyllensten, resigned in protest after the academy refused to denounce Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini for calling for the death of Salman Rushdie, author of *The Satanic Verses*.[22] A fourth member, Knut Ahnlund, decided to remain in the academy but later refused to participate in their work and resigned in 2005 in protest of the Nobel Prize in Literature awarded to Elfriede Jelinek. According to Ahnlund, the decision to award Jelinek ruined the worth of the Nobel Prize in Literature for a long time.[73][74]\n\n\n\n#### 2018 controversy and award cancellation[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2018, three members of the academy board resigned in response to a sexual misconduct investigation involving author Jean-Claude Arnault, who is married to board member Katarina Frostenson.[72] Arnault was accused by at least 18 women of sexual assault and harassment. He and his wife were also accused of leaking the names of prize recipients on at least seven occasions so friends could profit from bets.[75][72] He denied all accusations, although he was later convicted of rape and sentenced to two years and six months in prison.[76][77][78] Sara Danius, the board secretary, hired a law firm to investigate if Frostenson had leaked confidential information and if Arnault had any influence on the Academy, but no legal action was taken. The investigation caused a split within the Academy. Following a vote to exclude board member Frostenson, the three members resigned in protest over the decisions by the Academy.[72][22][79] Two former permanent secretaries, Sture All\u00e9n and Horace Engdahl, called Danius a weak leader.[72]\n\n\nOn 10 April, Danius was asked to resign from her position by the Academy, bringing the number of empty seats to four.[80] Although the Academy voted against removing Katarina Frostenson from the committee,[81] she voluntarily agreed to withdraw from participating in the academy, bringing the total of withdrawals to five. Because two other seats were still vacant from the Rushdie affair, this left only 11 active members, one short of the quorum needed to vote in replacements. On 4 May 2018, the Swedish Academy announced that the selection would be postponed until 2019, when two laureates would be chosen. It was still technically possible to choose a 2018 laureate, as only eight active members are required to choose a recipient. However, there were concerns that the academy was not in any condition to credibly present the award.[4][5][6][82] The New Academy Prize in Literature, not affiliated with either the Nobel Foundation or the Swedish Academy, was created as an alternative award for 2018 only.[83]\n\n\nThe scandal was widely seen as damaging to the credibility of the prize and its authority.[72] As noted by Andrew Brown in *The Guardian* in a lengthy deconstruction of the scandal:\n\n\n\n\n> \"The scandal has elements of a tragedy, in which people who set out to serve literature and culture discovered they were only pandering to writers and the people who hang around with them. The pursuit of excellence in art was entangled with the pursuit of social prestige. The academy behaved as if the meals in its clubhouse were as much an accomplishment as the work that got people elected there.\"[84]\n> \n> \n\n\nKing Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden said a reform of the rules may be evaluated, including the introduction of the right to resign in respect of the current lifelong membership of the committee.[85] On 5 March 2019, it was announced that the Nobel Prize in Literature would once again be awarded, and laureates for both 2018 and 2019 would be announced together. The decision came after several changes were made to the structure of the Swedish Academy as well as to the Nobel Committee members selection, in order to \"[restore] trust in the Academy as a prize-awarding institution\".[86]\n\n\n\n## Similar international prizes[edit]\n\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Literature is not the only literary prize for which all nationalities are eligible. Other notable international literary prizes include the Neustadt International Prize for Literature, the Jerusalem Prize, Franz Kafka Prize, the International Booker Prize, and the Formentor Prix International. The journalist Hephzibah Anderson has noted that the International Booker Prize \"is fast becoming the more significant award, appearing an ever more competent alternative to the Nobel\".[87] However, since 2016, the International Booker Prize now recognises an annual book of fiction translated into English.[88] Previous winners of the International Booker Prize who have gone on to win the Nobel Prize in Literature include Alice Munro and Olga Tokarczuk. The Neustadt International Prize for Literature is regarded as one of the most prestigious international literary prizes, often referred to as the American equivalent of the Nobel Prize.[89][90] Like the Nobel Prize, it is awarded not for any one work but for an entire body of work. It is frequently seen as an indicator of who may be awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature. Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez (1972 Neustadt, 1982 Nobel), Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz (1978 Neustadt, 1980 Nobel), Octavio Paz (1982 Neustadt, 1990 Nobel), Tomas Transtr\u00f6mer (1990 Neustadt, 2011 Nobel) were first awarded the Neustadt International Prize for Literature before being awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature.\n\n\nAnother award of note is the Spanish Princess of Asturias Award (formerly Prince of Asturias Award) in Letters. During the first years of its existence, it was almost exclusively awarded to writers in the Spanish language, but in more recent times, writers in other languages have been awarded as well. Writers who have won both the Asturias Award in Letters and the Nobel Prize in Literature include Camilo Jos\u00e9 Cela, G\u00fcnter Grass, Doris Lessing, and Mario Vargas Llosa.\n\n\nThe non-monetary America Award in Literature presents itself as an alternative to the Nobel Prize. To date, Peter Handke, Harold Pinter, Jos\u00e9 Saramago, and Mario Vargas Llosa are the only writers to have received both the America Award and the Nobel Prize in Literature.\n\n\nThere are also prizes for honouring the lifetime achievement of writers in specific languages, like the Miguel de Cervantes Prize (for Spanish language, established in 1976) and the Cam\u00f5es Prize (for Portuguese language, established in 1989). Nobel laureates who were also awarded the Miguel de Cervantes Prize include Octavio Paz (1981 Cervantes, 1990 Nobel); Mario Vargas Llosa (1994 Cervantes, 2010 Nobel); and Camilo Jos\u00e9 Cela (1995 Cervantes, 1989 Nobel). Jos\u00e9 Saramago is the only author to receive both the Cam\u00f5es Prize (1995) and the Nobel Prize (1998) to date.\n\n\nThe Hans Christian Andersen Award is sometimes referred to as \"the Little Nobel\". The award has earned this appellation since, in a similar manner to the Nobel Prize in Literature, it recognises the lifetime achievement of writers, though the Andersen Award focuses on a single category of literary works (children's literature).[91]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* The Big Read\n* List of literary awards\n* List of Nobel laureates\n* List of Nobel laureates in Literature\n* List of nominees for the Nobel Prize in Literature\n* Lists of 100 best books\n* Nobel Library\n* Swedish Academy Nordic Prize\n* World literature\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"The Nobel Prize amounts\".

Few people would deny Harold Pinter is a worthy recipient of the 2005 Nobel Prize in Literature. As a poet, screenwriter and author of more than 30 plays, he has dominated the English literary scene for half a century. However, his outspoken criticism of US foreign policy and opposition to the war in Iraq undoubtedly make him one of the more controversial figures to be awarded this prestigious honour. Indeed, the Nobel academy's decision could be read in some quarters as a selection with an inescapably political element. 'There is the view that the Nobel literature prize often goes to someone whose political stance is found to be sympathetic at a given moment,' said Alan Jenkins, deputy editor of the Times Literary Supplement. 'For the last 10 years he has been more angry and vituperative, and that cannot have failed to be noticed.' However, Mr Jenkins insists that, though Pinter's political views may have been a factor, the award is more than justified on artistic criteria alone. 'His dramatic and literary achievement is head and shoulders above any other British writer. He is far and away the most interesting, the best, the most powerful and most original of English playwrights.'\n49. **^** Eldridge, Richard (27 March 2009). *The Oxford Handbook of Philosophy and Literature*.
