It is the sequel to *Spider-Man: Homecoming* (2017) and *Spider-Man: Far From Home* (2019), and the 27th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film was directed by Jon Watts and written by Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers. It stars Tom Holland as Peter Parker / Spider-Man alongside Zendaya, Benedict Cumberbatch, Jacob Batalon, Jon Favreau, Jamie Foxx, Willem Dafoe, Alfred Molina, Benedict Wong, Tony Revolori, Marisa Tomei, Andrew Garfield, and Tobey Maguire. In the film, Parker asks Dr. Stephen Strange (Cumberbatch) to use magic to make his identity as Spider-Man a secret again following its public revelation at the end of *Far From Home*. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA third MCU Spider-Man film was planned during the production of *Homecoming* in 2017. Negotiations between Sony and Marvel Studios to alter their deal\u2014in which they produce the Spider-Man films together\u2014ended with Marvel Studios leaving the project in August 2019, but a negative fan reaction led to a new deal between the companies a month later. Watts, McKenna, Sommers, and Holland were set to return, and filming took place from October 2020 to March 2021 in New York City and Atlanta. *No Way Home* serves as a crossover between the MCU and the *Spider-Man* films directed by Sam Raimi and Marc Webb, featuring several actors reprising their roles from those films, including previous Spider-Man actors Maguire and Garfield. The involvement of both actors was the subject of wide speculation and numerous leaks despite the efforts of Sony, Marvel, and the cast to conceal their involvement.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nActors reprising their roles from earlier *Spider-Man* films include Willem Dafoe as Green Goblin, Alfred Molina as Doctor Octopus, Jamie Foxx as Electro, Thomas Haden Church as Sandman, Rhys Ifans as Lizard, and J. K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson.\n\nIn April 2021, Molina confirmed that he was appearing in the film, explaining that he had been told not to talk about his role in the film during production but he realized that his appearance had been widely rumored and reported on.[26] Later that month, J. B. Smoove revealed that he was returning as Julius Dell from *Far From Home*,[46] while Cox stated that he was not involved with the film.[115] In early May, Garfield denied that he had been asked to appear in the film, but later said \"never say never\",[116][117] while Angourie Rice was revealed to be returning as Betty Brant.[43] Later that month, Stone denied her involvement in the film.[118]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRhys Ifans reprises his role as Dr. Curt Connors / Lizard, an Oscorp scientist from Webb's *The Amazing Spider-Man* (2012) who transformed into a large reptilian monster while trying to regrow his missing arm. Thomas Haden Church reprises his role as Flint Marko / Sandman, a small-time thief from Raimi's *Spider-Man 3* who received an ability to transform into sand.[22] Both Ifans and Church returned to voice the characters, though footage at the end of the film when they revert to their human forms was archival footage from *The Amazing Spider-Man* and *Spider-Man 3*, respectively.[39] Watts served as a stand-in for Church on-set by providing motion-capture reference to the uncredited body double who physically replaced Church in the role.[40] Charlie Cox reprises his role as Matt Murdock from Marvel Television's Netflix series,[41] and Tom Hardy reprises his roles as Eddie Brock / Venom from Sony's Spider-Man Universe (SSU) in an uncredited cameo appearance in the mid-credits scene.[42]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Tom Holland as Peter Parker / Spider-Man:  \nA teenager and Avenger who received spider-like abilities after being bitten by a radioactive spider.[5] The film explores the fallout of *Spider-Man: Far From Home*'s (2019) mid-credits scene, in which Parker's identity as Spider-Man is exposed,[6] and Parker is more pessimistic in contrast to previous Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) films. Holland said Parker feels defeated and insecure and was excited to explore the darker side of the character.[7] The adjustment back to portraying Parker, including raising his voice pitch and returning to the mindset of a \"na\u00efve, charming teenager\", was strange for Holland after taking on more mature roles such as in *Cherry* (2021).[8]\n* Zendaya as Michelle \"MJ\" Jones-Watson:  \nParker's classmate and girlfriend.[9][10][11] The character's full name is revealed in the film, having previously just been known as Michelle Jones, bringing her closer to the comics counterpart Mary Jane Watson.[10]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBy December 2020, Alfred Molina was set to reprise his role as Otto Octavius / Doctor Octopus from Sam Raimi's *Spider-Man 2* (2004),[25] with Tobey Maguire reprising his role as Peter Parker / Spider-Man from Raimi's *Spider-Man* film trilogy and Andrew Garfield returning as Peter Parker / Spider-Man from Webb's *The Amazing Spider-Man* films.[31] A cameo appearance of Maguire and Garfield alongside Holland as their respective Spider-Men had previously been considered for the Sony Pictures Animation film *Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse* (2018), but was cut then because Sony felt at that moment that it would be too risky and confusing.[99] At that time, *Collider* reported that Maguire and Garfield would appear in the film alongside Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson from Raimi's *Spider-Man* film trilogy and Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy from the *Amazing Spider-Man* films.[100] The first draft of the script included other characters from the *Spider-Man* and *Amazing Spider-Man* films, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFans will be in heaven\".[236] Peter Debruge of *Variety* praised Garfield's and Maguire's performances and felt the film \"provides enough resolution for the past two decades of Spider-Man adventures that audiences who've tuned out along the way will be rewarded for giving this one a shot\".[33] Writing for *Den of Geek*, Don Kaye gave the film 4 out of 5 stars, for its action sequences, performances and chemistry of the cast, stating that \"*No Way Home* channels the entire spectrum of Spider-Man movies while setting the character on a course all his own at last\".[237] Jennifer Bisset of *CNET* praised the action sequences, performances, and story, writing: \"A Russo Brothers influence can almost be felt ushering Holland's third Spider-Man movie into new, weightier territory. If the character is to become the next Tony Stark, this is the way to etch a few more scars into a more interesting hero's facade. If you came for the biggest movie of the year, you'll definitely leave satisfied\".[238]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Lead actor Tom Holland and director Jon Watts in 2016\nDuring production on *Spider-Man: Homecoming* (2017), two sequels were being planned by Marvel Studios and Sony Pictures.[53] In June 2017, star Tom Holland explained that each film would take place during a different year of high school for Peter Parker / Spider-Man, with the third being set during the character's senior year.[54] Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige noted in July 2019 that the third film would feature \"a Peter Parker story that has never been done before on film\" due to the ending of the second film, *Spider-Man: Far From Home* (2019), which publicly reveals that Parker is Spider-Man.[55]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n2021 Marvel Studios film\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Spider-Man: No Way Home |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)Theatrical release poster\n |\n| Directed by | Jon Watts |\n| Based on | Spider-Manby * Stan Lee\n* Steve Ditko\n |\n| Produced by | * Kevin Feige\n* Amy Pascal\n |\n| Starring | * Tom Holland\n* Zendaya\n* Benedict Cumberbatch\n* Jacob Batalon\n* Jon Favreau\n* Jamie Foxx\n* Willem Dafoe\n* Alfred Molina\n* Benedict Wong\n* Tony Revolori\n* Marisa Tomei\n* Andrew Garfield\n* Tobey Maguire\n |\n| Cinematography | Mauro Fiore |\n| Edited by | * Jeffrey Ford\n* Leigh Folsom Boyd\n |\n| Music by | Michael Giacchino |\n| Productioncompanies\n | * Columbia Pictures\n* Marvel Studios\n* Pascal Pictures\n |\n| Distributed by | Sony Pictures Releasing |\n| Release dates\n | * December\u00a013,\u00a02021\u00a0(2021-12-13) (Fox Village Theatre)\n* December\u00a017,\u00a02021\u00a0(2021-12-17) (United States)\n |\n| Running time\n | 148 minutes[1] |\n| Country | United States |\n| Language | English |\n| Budget | $200\u00a0million[2] |\n| Box office | $1.922\u00a0billion[3][4] |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n60. **^** Thorne, Will (September 5, 2019). \"Sony Pictures Chief on Spider-Man Split: 'For the Moment the Door is Closed'\". *Variety*.

The film received positive reviews from critics and grossed over $1.9 billion worldwide, surpassing its predecessor as the highest-grossing film released by Sony Pictures. It became the highest-grossing film of 2021, the sixth-highest-grossing film of all time, the highest grossing Spider-Man film, and set several other box office records, including those for films released during the COVID-19 pandemic. The film received a nomination for Best Visual Effects at the 94th Academy Awards, among numerous other accolades. An extended version of the film, subtitled *The More Fun Stuff Version*, had a global theatrical release in September 2022. A sequel is in development.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 93%, with an average score of 7.9/10, based on 430 reviews. The site's critical consensus reads: \"A bigger, bolder *Spider-Man* sequel, *No Way Home* expands the franchise's scope and stakes without losing sight of its humor and heart.\"[233] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 71 out of 100, based on 60 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[234] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a rare \"A+\" grade on an A+ to F scale, the first live-action Spider-Man film and the fourth MCU film overall to earn the score after *The Avengers* (2012), *Black Panther* (2018), and *Avengers: Endgame*.[213] PostTrak reported 96% of audience members gave it a positive score, with 91% saying they would definitely recommend it.[213]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nJeffrey Ford and Leigh Folsom Boyd served as the film's editors.[137] The visual effects were provided by Cinesite, Clear Angle Studios, Crafty Apes, Digital Domain, Folks VFX, Framestore, Luma Pictures, Monsters Aliens Robots Zombies, Mr. X, Perception, Secret Lab, Sony Pictures Imageworks, and SSVFX.[138]\n\n\n\n## Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *Spider-Man: No Way Home* (soundtrack)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nVary of *Variety* noted that these reports were not confirmed and questioned whether the returning actors would be making more than cameo appearances.[104] Shortly after, Holland denied that Maguire and Garfield would appear in the film.[86] Many of the actors returning from previous *Spider-Man* films were brought to set in cloaks in order to help prevent their involvements in the film from leaking.[105] Around Christmas 2020, McKenna and Sommers rewrote the introductions of Maguire and Garfield as well as much of the third act in time for those actors to start filming. They had not been able to focus on those scenes earlier because they were busy during filming of much of the first and second acts in the previous months.[16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n262. **^** Barnes, Brooks (December 17, 2021). \"Kevin Feige and Amy Pascal on the Future of 'Spider-Man' and the M.C.U.\" *The New York Times*.

The existing deal had Marvel and Feige produce the Spider-Man films for Sony and receive 5% of their revenue. Sony wanted to expand the deal to include more films while keeping the same terms of the original agreement. Disney expressed concern with Feige's workload producing the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) franchise already and asked for a 25\u201350% stake in any future films Feige produced for Sony.[56][59][58] Unable to come to an agreement, Sony announced that it would be moving forward on the next Spider-Man film without Feige or Marvel's involvement. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Films | * *Spider-Man* (2002)\n* *Spider-Man 2* (2004)\n* *Spider-Man 3* (2007)\n* Accolades\n |\n| Characters | * Peter Parker\n* Mary Jane Watson\n* Harry Osborn\n* Norman Osborn\n* Otto Octavius\n* J.

Molina was surprised by this approach because he had aged in the years since he made that film; digital de-aging was also used to make him look physically the same as in *Spider-Man 2*.[26] The mechanical tentacles were created completely through CGI, rather than blending them with puppetry as in *Spider-Man 2*.[27][24]\n* Benedict Wong as Wong: Strange's mentor and friend who became the new Sorcerer Supreme during Strange's absence in the Blip.[28][19]\n* Tony Revolori as Eugene \"Flash\" Thompson: Parker's classmate and former rival.[29]\n* Marisa Tomei as May Parker:  \n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTwo weeks later, Peter visits MJ to reintroduce himself to her and Ned, but he decides against it.

He expressed interest in a film focusing on the Miles Morales version of Spider-Man instead. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Fan films | * *Spider-Man* (1969)\n* *Spider-Man Versus Kraven the Hunter*

who personally spoke to Disney CEO Bob Iger and Sony Pictures Motion Picture Group chairman Tom Rothman,[61] the companies returned to negotiations.[62] Sony and Disney announced a new agreement at the end of September which would allow Marvel Studios and Feige to produce another MCU Spider-Man film for Sony with Amy Pascal, scheduled for July 16, 2021.[5] Disney was reportedly co-financing 25% of the film in exchange for 25% of its profits, while retaining the character's merchandising rights.[5][62] Feige said he was \"thrilled\" that the character would remain in the MCU and said \"all of us at Marvel Studios are very excited that we get to keep working\" on the franchise. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Music | * *The Amazing Spider-Man*\n* *The Amazing Spider-Man 2*\n* *Music from

Batalon and Zendaya note that Holland could not be trusted with the actual title since he had \"accidentally\" revealed the second film's title. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nShe was hopeful that May's work as a community organizer would be featured in the film.[30] Also in June, Charlie Cox, who portrayed Matt Murdock / Daredevil in Marvel Television's Netflix series, was contacted by Feige about reprising his role in upcoming Marvel Studios projects starting with appearances in *No Way Home* and the Disney+ series *She-Hulk: Attorney at Law*.[73][74] The next month, Holland said production was planned to take place from late 2020 to February 2021,[75] and Sony shifted the film's release date to December 17, 2021.[76] Tony Revolori was also confirmed to be reprising his role as Flash Thompson.[29] In early October, Jacob Batalon and Benedict Cumberbatch were set to reprise their MCU roles of Ned Leeds and Strange, while Jamie Foxx was set to return as Max Dillon / Electro from Marc Webb's *The Amazing Spider-Man 2* (2014), with filming beginning later in the month.[17][12] Immediately prior to the beginning of filming, several other key actors in the film had yet to sign on. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n*CNN*'s Brian Lowry praised the humor and wrote, \"What's already apparent, though, is that this movie was conceived to be savored and enjoyed. And in what has become an increasingly elusive phenomenon, that will include whoops and hollers from appreciative fans in theaters, where *Spider-Man* will first reveal its secrets, and then, more than likely, shows off its legs.\"[243] Richard Roeper of *Chicago Sun-Times* gave the film 3 out of 4 and praised the performances of Holland and Zendaya, writing: \"There's nothing new or particularly memorable about the serviceable CGI and practical effects, but we remain invested in the outcome in large part because Holland remains the best of the cinematic Spider-Men, while Zendaya lends heart and smarts and warmth to every moment she's onscreen. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n99. **^** Bisset, Jennifer. \"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse almost had Tom Holland, Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield cameos\". *CNet*.

The film was directed by Jon Watts from a screenplay by the writing teams of Jonathan Goldstein and John Francis Daley, Watts and Christopher Ford, and Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers. Tom Holland stars as Peter Parker / Spider-Man, alongside Michael Keaton, Jon Favreau, Gwyneth Paltrow, Zendaya, Donald Glover, Jacob Batalon, Laura Harrier, Tony Revolori, Bokeem Woodbine, Tyne Daly, Marisa Tomei, and Robert Downey Jr. In the film, Peter Parker tries to balance high school life with being Spider-Man while facing the Vulture (Keaton).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn September 2019, Marvel Studios and Sony Pictures announced that they were set to produce a third film, after an impasse between the two companies during negotiations.[288] Watts returned to direct,[289] from a script by McKenna and Sommers.[290] Holland, Zendaya, Favreau, Tomei, Batalon,[291] and Revolori reprise their roles,[289] while Benedict Cumberbatch and Benedict Wong reprise their MCU roles as Doctor Strange and Wong.[292][291] Actors returning from past *Spider-Man* films include Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield returning as their versions of Spider-Man from Sam Raimi's *Spider-Man* trilogy and Marc Webb's *The Amazing Spider-Man* films, respectively,[293] alongside Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn / Green Goblin, Alfred Molina as Otto Octavius / Doctor Octopus, and Thomas Haden Church as Flint Marko / Sandman from Sam Raimi's *Spider-Man* trilogy, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn February 2015, Marvel Studios and Sony reached a deal to share the film rights for Spider-Man, integrating the character into the established MCU. The following June, Holland was cast as the title character, and Watts was hired to direct. This was followed shortly by the hiring of Daley and Goldstein. In April 2016, the film's title was revealed, along with additional cast, including Downey in his MCU role of Tony Stark / Iron Man. Principal photography began in June 2016 at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia, and continued in Atlanta, Los Angeles, and New York City. The other screenwriters were revealed during filming, which concluded in Berlin in October 2016. The production team made efforts to differentiate the film from previous Spider-Man films.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n6. **^** Young, Kai (October 25, 2023). \"Official MCU Timeline Book Admits Spider-Man: Homecoming Mistake\". *Screen Rant*.

He felt that this was also the responsibility of this film since it had to introduce Spider-Man to the already established MCU.[115] Specific comics that Watts noted as potential influences were *Ultimate Spider-Man* and *Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane*.[132] In December, Oliver Scholl signed on to be the production designer for the film.[133]\n\n\n\n### Pre-production[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nKenneth Turan of the *Los Angeles Times* gave the film a mixed review, criticizing the \"juvenile\" depiction of Parker and Watts' \"unevenly orchestrated\" direction, but feeling that the film \"finds its pace and rhythm by the end\" and praising Keaton's performance.[271] *The Hollywood Reporter*'s John DeFore found the film to be \"occasionally exciting but often frustrating\", and suggested it might have worked better if less focus had been put on integrating the film with the MCU. DeFore did praise Holland's performance as \"winning\" despite the script, and called Zendaya a scene-stealer.[272] Mick LaSalle, writing for the *San Francisco Chronicle*, said the film was a \"pretty good Spider-Man movie\" that \"breaks no new ground\", not exploring the human side of the character enough and instead focusing on action that is not thrilling.[273] At *The Telegraph*, Robbie Collin argued that \"a little of the new Spider-Man went an exhilaratingly long way in *Captain America: Civil War* last year. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nSpider-Man in other media\n |\n| --- |\n| Television | * *Spider-Man* (1967\u201370)\n* *Spidey Super Stories* (1974\u201377)\n* *The Amazing Spider-Man* (1977\u201379)\n* *Spider-Man* (1978\u201379)\n* *Spider-Man* (1981\u201382)\n* *Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends* (1981\u201383)\n* *Spider-Man* (1994\u201398)\n* *Spider-Man Unlimited* (1999\u20132001)\n* *Spider-Man: The New Animated Series* (2003)\n* *The Spectacular Spider-Man* (2008\u201309)\n* *Ultimate Spider-Man* (2012\u201317)\n* *Spider-Man* (2017\u201320)\n* *Spidey and His Amazing Friends* (2021\u2013present)\n |\n| Film | * *Spider-Man* (1977)\n* *Spider-Man* (1978)\n* *Spider-Man Strikes Back* (1978)\n* *The Dragon's Challenge* (1981)\n* *Spider-Man* (2002)\n* *Spider-Man 2* (2004)\n* *Spider-Man 3* (2007)\n* *The Amazing Spider-Man* (2012)\n* *The Amazing Spider-Man 2* (2014)\n* *Homecoming* (2017)\n* *Into the Spider-Verse* (2018)\n* *Spider-Ham: Caught in a Ham* (2019)\n* *Far From Home* (2019)\n* *No Way Home* (2021)\n* *Across the Spider-Verse* (2023)\n* *The Spider Within: A Spider-Verse Story* (2023)\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| *Spider-Man: Homecoming*\n |\n| --- |\n| | * v\n* t\n* e\nSpider-Man in film\n |\n| --- |\n| Franchises | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| *The Amazing Spider-Man* | * *Spider-Man* (1977)\n* *Spider-Man Strikes Back* (1978)\n* *Spider-Man: The Dragon's Challenge* (1981)\n |\n| Japanese *Spider-Man* | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Film | * *Spider-Man* (1978)\n |\n| Characters | * Takuya Yamashiro\n |\n\n |\n| *Spider-Man* | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Films | * *Spider-Man* (2002)\n* *Spider-Man 2* (2004)\n* *Spider-Man 3* (2007)\n* Accolades\n |\n| Characters | * Peter Parker\n* Mary Jane Watson\n* Harry Osborn\n* Norman Osborn\n* Otto Octavius\n* J.

Stark also builds in a \"training wheels\" protocol, to initially limit Parker's access to all of its features. Carroll noted Marvel went through the comics and \"pull[ed] out all the sort of fun and wacky things the suit did\" to include in the *Homecoming* suit.[154] Spider-Man's web-shooters have various settings, first teased at the end of *Civil War*, which Carroll explained allowed him to \"adjust the spray\" to different settings like the spinning web, web ball, or ricochet web. He compared this to a DSLR camera.[114]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHolland felt this would carry over well to the film, where other characters do not suspect Parker of being Spider-Man.[14] It took 25 to 45 minutes for Holland to get into costume, depending on if he had to wear a stunt harness underneath the suit.[13] Holland initially signed for six MCU films, including three Spider-Man films.[15]\n* Michael Keaton as Adrian Toomes / Vulture:  \n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWatts, Holland, Batalon, Harrier, Revolori, and Zendaya appeared at the 2016 San Diego Comic-Con to show an exclusive clip of the film,[36][197] which also had a panel at Comic Con Experience 2016.[198] The first trailer for *Homecoming* premiered on *Jimmy Kimmel Live!* on December 8, 2016,[199] and was released online alongside an international version, which Feige thought was different enough that \"it would be fun for people to see both.\"[18] The shots of Vulture descending through a hotel atrium and Spider-Man swinging with Iron Man flying beside him were created specifically for the trailer. Watts explained that the Vulture shot was created for Comic-Con and \"was never meant to be in the movie\", but he was able to repurpose the angle for Vulture's reveal in the film. The Spider-Man and Iron Man shot was created because the marketing team wanted a shot of the two together, and existing shots \"just didn't look that great\" then. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nthe film's largest markets were China ($115.7 million),[243] South Korea ($51.4 million), and the United Kingdom ($34.8 million).[264]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Tom Holland's performance as Spider-Man received praise.\nThe review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 92%, with an average score of 7.6/10, based on 400 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"*Spider-Man: Homecoming* does whatever a second reboot can, delivering a colorful, fun adventure that fits snugly in the sprawling MCU without getting bogged down in franchise-building.\"[265] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 73 out of 100, based on 51 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[266] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave it an 89% overall positive score and a 74% \"definite recommend\".[103]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHowever, a small adjustment was made to a 2011 deal that gave Marvel full control of Spider-Man's merchandising rights, in exchange for a one-time payment of $175\u00a0million to Sony and paying up to $35\u00a0million for each future Spider-Man film rather than receiving their previous five percent of a Spider-Man film's revenue\u2014Marvel could now reduce their $35\u00a0million payment if the co-produced film grossed more than $750\u00a0million.[100] Marvel Studios still received five percent of first dollar gross for the film.[101] Lone Star Funds also co-financed the film with Sony, via its LSC Film Corporation deal,[102] covering 25 percent of the $175\u00a0million budget,[103] while Columbia Pictures officially served as co-producer with Marvel Studios.[104] Sony also paid Marvel Studios an undisclosed producer fee.[105]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHe also said that the film hoped to use one of Spider-Man's rogues that have not been seen in film yet,[126] and that filming would begin in June 2016.[127] In July 2015, it was reported that Marisa Tomei had been offered the role of May Parker, Peter's aunt.[50] It was also revealed that Daley and Goldstein, after missing out on the director role, had begun negotiations to write the screenplay,[128] and were given three days to present Marvel with their pitch;[129] both confirmed shortly after that they had reached a deal to write the screenplay.[130] The pair had proposed a take on the character that was \"diametrically opposed\" to the previous Spider-Man films, creating a laundry list of all the elements seen in those films and actively trying to avoid re-using them. They chose to focus on the high school aspects of the character rather than the \"drama and weight of the tragedy that leads to the origin of Spider-Man\". \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n295. **^** Dornbush, Jonathon (February 24, 2021). \"Spider-Man 3's Title Is Spider-Man: No Way Home\". *IGN*.

Bagley penciled the flagship Spider-Man title from 1991 to 1996.[82] During that time, Bagley's rendition of Spider-Man was used extensively for licensed material and merchandise.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nSpider-Man\n |\n| --- |\n| * **Stan Lee**\n* **Steve Ditko**\n |\n| Characters | * Peter Parker\n* Ben Reilly\n* Miguel O'Hara\n* Miles Morales\n* Otto Octavius\n* Supporting characters\n* Enemies\n* Alternative versions of Spider-Man\n* Incarnations of Spider-Man\n |\n| Locations | * Midtown High School\n* *Daily Bugle*\n* Oscorp\n* Life Foundation\n* Parker Industries\n* Alchemax\n |\n| Comic books | * *The Amazing Spider-Man*\n* Storylines\n |\n| Other media | * In film\n* In television\n* In video games\n\t+ *Marvel's Spider-Man*\n* In novels\n* In literature\u200e\n |\n| Toys | * *The Amazing Spider-Man* (pinball)\n* *Spider-Man* (pinball)\n* *Spider-Man Classics*\n* *Spider-Man and Friends*\n* Lego Spider-Man\n |\n| See also | * Bibliography of works on Spider-Man\n* \"With great power comes great responsibility\"\n |\n| * **![](image)** **Category**\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFollowing the 2015 *Secret Wars* event, a number of Spider-Man-related titles were either relaunched or created as part of the \"All-New, All-Different Marvel\" event. Among them, *The Amazing Spider-Man* was relaunched as well and primarily focused on Peter Parker continuing to run Parker Industries and becoming a successful businessman operating worldwide.[105] It also tied with *Civil War II* (involving an Inhuman named Ulysses Cain who can predict possible futures), *Dead No More* (where Ben Reilly [the original Scarlet Spider] revealed to be revived and as one of the antagonists instead), and *Secret Empire* (during Hydra's reign led by a Hydra influenced Captain America/Steve Rogers, and the dismissal of Parker Industries by Peter Parker to stop Otto Octavius). Starting in September 2017, Marvel started the Marvel Legacy event which renumbered several Marvel series to their original numbering. The *Amazing Spider-Man* was put back to its original numbering for #789. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWith issue No. 30 (June 2001), J. Michael Straczynski took over as writer[90] and oversaw additional storylines \u2013 most notably his lengthy \"Spider-Totem\" arc, which raised the issue of whether Spider-Man's powers were magic-based, rather than as the result of a radioactive spider's bite. Additionally, Straczynski resurrected the plot point of Aunt May discovering her nephew was Spider-Man,[91] and returned Mary Jane, with the couple reuniting in *The Amazing Spider-Man* (vol. 2) #50. Straczynski gave Spider-Man a new profession, having Parker teach at his former high school.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* *Spider-Man/Black Cat: The Evil that Men Do* (2002)\n* *Venom vs. Carnage* (2004)\n* *Spider-Man: House of M* (2005)\n* *Spider-Man and the Fantastic Four* (2007)\n* *Spider-Man: With Great Power* (2008)\n* *Astonishing Spider-Man & Wolverine* (2010)\n* *Spider-Man and the X-Men* (2014)\n |\n| Outsidemainstreamcontinuity | * *Marvel Adventures Spider-Man*\n* *Spider-Gwen*\n* *Spider-Man 2099*\n* *Spider-Man: Chapter One*\n* *Spider-Man Noir*\n* *Spider-Man: India*\n* *Spider-Girl*\n* *Peter Porker, the Spectacular Spider-Ham*\n* *Spider-Man: Reign*\n* *Ultimate Spider-Man*\n* *Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man*\n* *Spider-Man: Life Story*\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Manga series | * *Spider-Man: The Manga*\n* *Spider-Man J*\n* *Marvel Mangaverse: Spider-Man*\n\t+ *Legend of the Spider-Clan*\n\t+ *The Rings of Fate*\n* *Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane*\n* *Spider-Man: Fake Red*\n* *Spider-Man: Octopus Girl*\n* *Spider-Man: Kizuna*\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFollowing this, Marvel made *The Amazing Spider-Man* the company's sole Spider-Man title, increasing its frequency of publication to three issues monthly, and inaugurating the series with a sequence of \"back to basics\" story arcs under the banner of \"Brand New Day\". Parker now exists in a changed world where he and Mary Jane had never married, and Parker has no memory of being married to her, with domino effect differences in their immediate world. The most notable of these revisions to Spider-Man continuity are the return of Harry Osborn, whose death in *The Spectacular Spider-Man* No. 200 (May 1993) is erased; and the reestablishment of Spider-Man's secret identity, with no one except Mary Jane able to recall that Parker is Spider-Man (although he soon reveals his secret identity to the New Avengers and the Fantastic Four). Under the banner of *Brand New Day*, Marvel tried to only use newly created villains instead of relying on older ones. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn January 2022, it was announced that writer Zeb Wells and John Romita Jr. would be working on a relaunched *The Amazing Spider-Man*, bringing the number of volumes for the title to its sixth, with the series beginning in April 2022 as a semi-monthly publication. The relaunch encompasses both a legacy numbering of #900 as well as the 60th anniversary for the character. The relaunch took place months after a mysterious event that left Peter on bad terms with the superhero community and ended his relationship with Mary Jane. He ends up taking a job at Oscorp and begins working closely with Norman Osborn and starts dating Black Cat. The volume's first crossover event was entitled *Dark Web*, with Chasm having teamed up with Madelyne Pryor to bring limbo to Earth. It's later revealed that Benjamin Rabin, the emissary of the Mayan god of mischief Wayeb', sent Peter and Mary Jane to an alternate dimension to conduct a ceremony that would allow Wayeb to control the Earth. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Crossovers | * *Superman vs. The Amazing Spider-Man* (1976)\n* *Superman and Spider-Man* (1981)\n* *Spider-Men* (2012)\n* *Spider-Verse* (2014)\n |\n| Storylines | * \"If This Be My Destiny...!\" (1965)\n* \"Green Goblin Reborn!\" (1971)\n* \"The Six Arms Saga\" (1971)\n* \"The Night Gwen Stacy Died\" (1973)\n* \"Nothing Can Stop the Juggernaut!\" (1982)\n* \"The Kid Who Collects Spider-Man\" (1984)\n* \"Secret Wars\" (1984)\n* \"Alien Costume Saga\" (1984)\n* \"The Death of Jean DeWolff\" (1985)\n* \"The Wedding!\" (1987)\n* \"Fearful Symmetry: Kraven's Last Hunt\" (1987)\n* \"Torment\" (1990)\n* \"Maximum Carnage\" (1993)\n* \"The Clone Saga\" (1994-1996)\n* \"Identity Crisis\" (1998)\n* \"The Gathering of Five\" and \"The Final Chapter\" (1998)\n* \"Flowers for Rhino\" (2001)\n* \"The Other\" (2005)\n* \"Civil War\" (2006-2007)\n* \"Back in Black\" (2007)\n* \"One More Day\" (2007)\n* \"Brand New Day\" (2008)\n* \"New Ways to Die\" (2008)\n* \"Spidey Meets the President!\" (2009)\"\n* \"The Gauntlet\" and \"Grim Hunt\" (2009)\n* \"One Moment in Time\" (2010)\n* \"Big Time\" (2010)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDavid Michelinie took over as writer in the next issue, for a story arc in #290\u2013292 (July\u2013Sept. 1987) that led to the marriage of Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson in *Amazing Spider-Man Annual* No. 21. The \"Kraven's Last Hunt\" storyline by writer J.M. DeMatteis and artists Mike Zeck and Bob McLeod crossed over into *The Amazing Spider-Man* #293 and 294.[77] Issue No.298 (Mar. 1988) was the first Spider-Man comic to be drawn by future industry star Todd McFarlane, the first regular artist on *The Amazing Spider-Man* since Frenz's departure. McFarlane revolutionized Spider-Man's look. His depiction \u2013 \"Ditko-esque\" poses,[78] large eyes; wiry, contorted limbs; and messy, knotted, convoluted webbing \u2013 influenced the way virtually all subsequent artists would draw the character. McFarlane's other significant contribution to the Spider-Man canon was the design for what would become one of Spider-Man's most wildly popular antagonists, the supervillain Venom.[79] Issue No. 299 (Apr. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn March 2018, it was announced that writer Nick Spencer would be writing the main semi-monthly *The Amazing Spider-Man* series beginning with a new No. 1, replacing long-time writer Dan Slott, as part of the Fresh Start relaunch that July.[106]\nThe first five-issue story arc was titled 'Back to Basics.' During the *Back to Basics* story, Kindred, a mysterious villain with some relation to Peter's past, was introduced, and Peter resumed his romantic relationship with Mary Jane once more. The first major story under Spencer was *Hunted* which ran through issues 16 through 23, the story also included four \".HU\" issues for issues 16, 18, 19, and 20.

After 32 issues, the volume was once again relaunched as part of *Marvel Legacy*, returning to the overall \"legacy\" numbering with issue No. 789 in late 2017. Less than a year later, the series was relaunched again with a fifth volume as part of Marvel's *Fresh Start*. For the first time, although the issue numbers were again restarted from #1, the issues also bore the overall \"legacy\" issue number. A sixth volume commenced in April 2022 to celebrate Spider-Man's 60th anniversary.

The relaunch included the Sandman being regressed to his criminal ways and the \"death\" of Mary Jane, which was ultimately reversed. Other elements included the introduction of a new Spider-Woman (who was spun off into her own short-lived series) and references to John Byrne's miniseries *Spider-Man: Chapter One*, which was launched at the same time as the reboot. Byrne also penciled issues #1\u201318 (from 1999 to 2000) and wrote #13\u201314, John Romita Jr. took his place soon after in October 2000.

Issue No. 4 introduced Silk, a new heroine who was bitten by the same spider as Peter Parker. Issues #7\u20138 featured a team-up between Ms. Marvel and Spider-Man, and had backup stories that tied into \"Edge of Spider-Verse\". The next major plot arc, titled \"Spider-Verse\", began in Issue No. 9 and ended in No. 15, features every Spider-Man from across the dimensions being hunted by Morlun, and a team-up to stop him, with Peter Parker of Earth-616 in command of the Spider-Men's Alliance. *The Amazing Spider-Man Annual* No. 1 of the relaunched series was released in December 2014, featuring stories unrelated to \"Spider-Verse\".\n\n\n\n### The Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* *Spider-Man: Kraven's Last Hunt* [#293\u2013294; *Web of Spider-Man* #31\u201332; *The Spectacular Spider-Man* #131\u2013132] (ISBN\u00a00785134506)\n* *Visionaries: Todd McFarlane* [#298\u2013305] (ISBN\u00a00785108009)\n* *Legends, Vol. 2: Todd McFarlane* [#306\u2013314; *The Spectacular Spider-Man Annual* #10] (ISBN\u00a00785110372)\n* *Legends, Vol. 3: Todd McFarlane* [#315\u2013323, 325, 328] (ISBN\u00a00785110399)\n* *Spider-Man: Venom Returns* [#330\u2013333, 344\u2013347;*Annual* #25] (ISBN\u00a00871359669)\n* *Spider-Man: Carnage* [#344\u2013345, 359\u2013363] (ISBN\u00a00871359715)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAlthough credited only as artist for most of his run, Ditko would eventually plot the stories as well as draw them, leaving Lee to script the dialogue.

The exact reasons for the Ditko-Lee split have never been fully explained.[33] Spider-Man successor artist John Romita Sr., in a 2010 deposition, recalled that Lee and Ditko \"ended up not being able to work together because they disagreed on almost everything, cultural, social, historically, everything, they disagreed on characters...\"[34]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter Spencer left the book, Marvel announced the \"Beyond\" era of Spider-Man would start in #75.

The book would also be released three times a month. \"Beyond\" would focus on Ben Reilly taking up the mantle of Spider-Man once again but backed by the Beyond corporation. Peter also falls ill and cannot be Spider-Man so he gives Ben his blessing to carry on as the main Spider-Man. However, following the conclusion of the storyline in #93, Peter has resumed active duties as Spider-Man, while Ben suffers a mental breakdown and becomes the villain Chasm.\n\n\n\n### 2022 relaunch[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWith No. 389, writer J. M. DeMatteis, whose Spider-Man credits included the 1987 \"Kraven's Last Hunt\" story arc and a 1991\u20131993 run on *The Spectacular Spider-Man*, took over the title. From October 1994 to June 1996, *Amazing* stopped running stories exclusive to it, and ran installments of multi-part stories that crossed over into all the Spider-Man books. One of the few self-contained stories during this period was in No. 400 (April 1995), which featured the death of Aunt May \u2013 later revealed to have been faked (although the death still stands in the MC2 continuity). The \"Clone Saga\" culminated with the revelation that the Spider-Man who had appeared in the previous 20 years of comics was a clone of the real Spider-Man. This plot twist was massively unpopular with many readers,[87] and was later reversed in the \"Revelations\" story arc that crossed over the Spider-Man books in late 1996.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThat year Peter Parker revealed his Spider-Man identity on live television in the company-crossover storyline \"Civil War\",[92][93] in which the superhero community is split over whether to conform to the federal government's new Superhuman Registration Act. This knowledge was erased from the world with the event of the four-part, crossover story arc, \"One More Day\", written partially by J. Michael Straczynski and illustrated by Joe Quesada, running through *The Amazing Spider-Man* #544\u2013545 (Nov.-Dec. 2007), *Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man* No. 24 (Nov. 2007) and *The Sensational Spider-Man* No. 41 (Dec. 2007), the final issues of those two titles. Here, the demon Mephisto makes a Faustian bargain with Parker and Mary Jane, offering to save Parker's dying Aunt May if the couple will allow their marriage to have never existed, rewriting that portion of their pasts. This story arc marked the end of Straczynski's work on the title.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Lee-Ditko era continued to usher in a significant number of villains and supporting characters, including Doctor Octopus in No. 3 (July 1963);[12][13] the Sandman and Betty Brant in No. 4 (Sept. 1963);[14] the Lizard in No. 6 (Nov. 1963);[15][16] Living Brain in No. 8 (Jan. 1964); Electro in No. 9 (Mar. 1964);[17][18] Mysterio in No. 13 (June 1964);[19] the Green Goblin in No. 14 (July 1964);[20][21] Kraven The Hunter in No. 15 (Aug. 1964);[22] reporter Ned Leeds in No. 18 (Nov. 1964);[23] and the Scorpion in No. 20 (Jan. 1965).[24] The Molten Man was introduced in No. 28 (Sept. 1965) which also featured Parker's graduation from high school.[25] Peter began attending Empire State University in No. 31 (Dec. 1965), which featured the first appearances of friends and classmates Gwen Stacy[26] and Harry Osborn.[27] Harry's father, Norman Osborn first appeared in No. 23 (April 1965) as a member of Jameson's country club but was not named nor revealed as Harry's father until No. 37 (June 1966).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n***The Amazing Spider-Man*** is an ongoing American superhero comic book series featuring the Marvel Comics superhero Spider-Man as its title character and main protagonist. Being in the mainstream continuity of the franchise, it was the character's first title, launching seven months after his introduction in the final issue of *Amazing Fantasy*. The series began publication with a March 1963 cover date and has been published nearly continuously to date over six volumes with only one significant interruption. Issues of the title currently feature an issue number within its sixth volume, as well as a \"legacy\" number reflecting the issue's overall number across all *Amazing Spider-Man* volumes.

Free of any of the baggage the character had accrued since the death of Gwen, he was supposed to reconnect the audience to Spider-Man. The problem is, all writing is a magic trick. You try to pull fast ones on the audience so that they don't look too closely. In this case, it was easy to cast Marvel as Bullwinkle, announcing his intention to pull a rabbit out of his hat, and the fans as a skeptical Rocky loudly proclaiming, 'That trick never works!' And it didn't. Because fans don't like to be treated as if they're stupid.\n88. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Hunt, James (August 5, 2008). \"The Marvel 500s: How Many Are There?\". *Comic Book Resources*.

Comics historian Les Daniels noted that \"Steve Ditko squeezes every ounce of anguish out of Spider-Man's predicament, complete with visions of the uncle he failed and the aunt he has sworn to save.\"[28] Peter David observed that \"After his origin, this two-page sequence from *Amazing Spider-Man* No. 33 is perhaps the best-loved sequence from the Stan Lee/Steve Ditko era.\"[29] Steve Saffel stated the \"full page Ditko image from *The Amazing Spider-Man* No. 33 is one of the most powerful ever to appear in the series and influenced writers and artists for many years to come.\"[30] and Matthew K. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* *Spider-Man: Trouble on the Horizon* [#678\u2013681, 679.1] (ISBN\u00a0978-0-7851-6003-8)\n* *Spider-Man: Ends of the Earth* [#682\u2013687; *Amazing Spider-Man: Ends of the Earth* #1; *Avenging Spider-Man* #8] (ISBN\u00a00785160051)\n* *Spider-Man: Lizard \u2013 No Turning Back* [#688\u2013691; *Untold Tales of Spider-Man* #9] (ISBN\u00a0978-0-7851-6008-3)\n* *Spider-Man: Danger Zone* [#692\u2013697; *Avenging Spider-Man* #11] (ISBN\u00a00785160094)\n* *Spider-Man: Dying Wish* [#698\u2013700] (ISBN\u00a00-7851-6523-1)\n* *The Amazing Spider-Man Omnibus Vol. 1* [#1\u201338, *Annual* #1\u20132; *Amazing Fantasy* #15; *Strange Tales Annual* #2; *Fantastic Four Annual* #1] (ISBN\u00a00785124020)\n* *The Amazing Spider-Man Omnibus Vol. 2* [#39\u201367, *Annual* #3\u20135; *Spectacular Spider-Man* #1\u20132] (ISBN\u00a0978-1302901806)\n* *Marvel Masterworks: The Amazing Spider-Man Vol. 1* [#1\u201310; *Amazing Fantasy* #15] (ISBN\u00a00-7851-1256-1)\n* *Marvel Masterworks: The Amazing Spider-Man Vol. 2* [#11\u201319, *Annual* #1] (ISBN\u00a00-7851-1264-2)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nComic book series\n\nThis article is about the comic book series.

Filmmakers Tobe Hooper, James Cameron, and Joseph Zito were all attached to direct the film at one point. However, the project would languish in development hell due to licensing and financial issues. After progress on the film stalled for nearly 25 years, it was licensed for a worldwide release by Columbia Pictures in 1999 after it acquired options from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) on all previous scripts developed by Cannon Films, Carolco, and New Cannon. Exercising its option on just two elements from the multi-script acquisition (a different screenplay was written by James Cameron, Ted Newsom, John Brancato, Barney Cohen, and Joseph Goldman), Sony hired Koepp to create a working screenplay (credited as Cameron's), and Koepp received sole credit in final billing.

Directed by Sam Raimi from a screenplay by David Koepp, it is the first installment in Raimi's *Spider-Man* trilogy, produced by Columbia Pictures in association with Marvel Enterprises and Laura Ziskin Productions, and distributed by Sony Pictures Releasing. The film stars Tobey Maguire as the titular character, alongside Willem Dafoe, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, Cliff Robertson, and Rosemary Harris. The film chronicles Spider-Man's origin story and early superhero career. After being bitten by a genetically altered spider, outcast teenager Peter Parker develops spider-like superhuman abilities and adopts a masked superhero identity to fight crime and injustice in New York City, facing the sinister Green Goblin in the process.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nJ. K. Simmons portrays J. Jonah Jameson, the grouchy publisher of the *Daily Bugle* newspaper who considers Spider-Man a criminal. Ron Perkins portrays Mendel Stromm, Osborn's head scientist, while Gerry Becker and Jack Betts play board members Maximillian Fargas and Henry Balkan. Stanley Anderson plays General Slocum and Jim Ward plays the Project Coordinator. John Paxton portrays Bernard Houseman, the butler to the Osborn family. Joe Manganiello portrays Parker's bully and rival Flash Thompson, while Sally Livingstone portrays Liz Allan.[14] Jason Padgett portrays Flash's Crony.[15] Bill Nunn, Ted Raimi and Elizabeth Banks portray Daily Bugle editor Robbie Robertson, Daily Bugle employees Ted Hoffman, and Jameson's secretary Betty Brant, respectively.[16][17] Michael Papajohn appears as \"The Carjacker\", the robber who kills Ben Parker.[18] Bruce Campbell, a long-time colleague of director Sam Raimi, cameoed as the announcer at the wrestling ring Parker takes part in. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nRemaining a constant in all the rewrites was the \"organic webshooter\" idea from the Cameron \"scriptment\".[70] Raimi felt he would stretch the audience's suspension of disbelief too far to have Parker invent mechanical webshooters.[71]\n\n\nRosenberg removed Doctor Octopus and created several new action sequences.[72] Raimi felt adding a third origin story would make the film too complex. Sequences removed from the final film had Spider-Man protecting Maximilian Fargas, the wheelchair-using Oscorp executive, from the Goblin, and Spider-Man defusing a hostage situation on a train.[60] As production neared, Ziskin hired award-winning writer Alvin Sargent, to polish the dialogue, primarily between Parker and Mary Jane.[73] Columbia gave the Writers Guild of America a list of four writers as contributors to the final *Spider-Man* script: Rosenberg, Sargent and James Cameron, all three of whom voluntarily relinquished credit to the fourth, Koepp.[66]\n\n\n\n### Casting[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n66. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Hiltzik, Michael A.

K. Simmons, is often cited as one of the film's high points. Eric Harrison, of the *Houston Chronicle*, was initially skeptical of the casting of Maguire, but after seeing the film he stated, \"it becomes difficult to imagine anyone else in the role.\"[213] *USA Today* critic Mike Clark believed the casting rivaled that of Christopher Reeve as 1978's *Superman*.[214] Owen Gleiberman, of *Entertainment Weekly*, had mixed feelings about the casting, particularly Tobey Maguire. \"Maguire, winning as he is, never quite gets the chance to bring the two sides of Spidey\u2014the boy and the man, the romantic and the avenger\u2014together.\"[215] *The Hollywood Reporter*'s Kirk Honeycutt thought: \"the filmmakers' imaginations work in overdrive from the clever design of the cobwebby opening credits and Spider-Man and M.J.'s upside down kiss\u2014after one of his many rescues of her\u2014to a finale that leaves character relationships open ended for future adventures.\"[216]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBy 1985, a new script was being written by Ted Newsom and John Brancato. In this version, Peter Parker receives his spider-like abilities from a cyclotron experiment. Doctor Octopus served as the antagonist and was written as Parker's mentor turned enemy. Barney Cohen was brought in to do a rewrite which added humor, additional action scenes, and a supporting villain.[38] Newsom and Brancato had John Cusack in mind for the part of Peter Parker.[39] Cannon hired Joseph Zito to direct the film having previously directed the commercially successful *Invasion U.S.A.* for the studio. For the role of Peter Parker/Spider-Man, the studio considered Tom Cruise while Zito was interested in casting actor and stuntman Scott Leva who had previously done promotional appearances as Spider-Man for Marvel.[40] Bob Hoskins was considered for Doctor Octopus while Lauren Bacall and Katharine Hepburn were considered for Aunt May. The role of Uncle Ben was considered for Gregory Peck and Paul Newman. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker / Spider-Man:  \nAn academically gifted high school student who is socially inept. After a genetically engineered spider bites him, he gains spider-like powers, including super-strength, enhanced reflexes, a \"spider sense\" that warns him of incoming danger, and the ability to climb walls and shoot spiderwebs (in a departure from the comics, where he utilizes web-shooters).

There, a genetically engineered \"super-spider\" bites him, and he falls ill upon returning home.

Without the context of eyes or mouth, a lot of body language had to be put in so that there would be emotional content. Raimi wanted to convey the essence of Spider-Man as being, \"the transition that occurs between him being a young man going through puberty and being a superhero.\" Dykstra said his crew of animators had never reached such a level of sophistication to give subtle hints of still making Spider-Man feel like a human being.[132] When two studio executives were shown shots of the computer generated character, they believed it was actually Maguire performing stunts.[60] In addition, Dykstra's crew had to composite areas of New York City and replaced every car in shots with digital models. Raimi did not want it to feel entirely like animation, so none of the shots were 100% computer-generated.[133]\n\n\n\n## Music[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Spider-Man |\n| --- |\n| ![Spider-Man in his suit crawling over a building and looking towards the viewer.

The film received positive reviews from audiences and critics who praised Raimi's direction, the story, the performances, visual effects, action sequences, and musical score. It was the first film to reach $100 million in a single weekend, as well as the most successful film based on a comic book at the time. With a box office gross of over $825 million worldwide, it was the third highest-grossing film of 2002, the highest-grossing superhero film, and the sixth-highest-grossing film overall at the time of its release. The film garnered nominations for Best Sound and Best Visual Effects at the 75th Academy Awards, among numerous other accolades. *Spider-Man* is credited for redefining the modern superhero genre, as well as the summer blockbuster.[7][8][9] After its success, the film spawned two sequels, *Spider-Man 2* (2004) and *Spider-Man 3* (2007). \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn April 1999, although Sony Pictures optioned from MGM all preceding script versions of a *Spider-Man* film, it only exercised the options on \"the Cameron material\", which contractually included a multi-author screenplay and a forty-five-page \"scriptment\" credited only to James Cameron. The studio announced they were not hiring Cameron himself to direct the film nor would they be using his script.[57] The studio lined up Roland Emmerich, Tony Scott, Chris Columbus, Barry Sonnenfeld, Tim Burton, Michael Bay, Ang Lee, David Fincher, Jan de Bont and M. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n*LA Weekly*'s Manohla Dargis wrote, \"It isn't that Spider-Man is inherently unsuited for live-action translation; it's just that he's not particularly interesting or, well, animated.\"[217] Giving it two and a half stars out of four, Roger Ebert of the *Chicago Sun-Times* felt that the film lacked a decent action element: \"Consider the scene where Spider-Man is given a cruel choice between saving Mary Jane or a cable car full of school kids. He tries to save both, so that everyone dangles from webbing that seems about to pull loose. The visuals here could have given an impression of the enormous weights and tensions involved, but instead the scene seems more like a bloodless storyboard of the idea.\"[218]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n22. **^** Lawrence, Gregory (July 11, 2020). \"Tig Notaro on 'Under a Rock', 'Star Trek: Discovery', and Auditioning for 'Spider-Man'\". *Collider*.

Jonah Jameson in the film. The project was tentatively titled *Spider-Man: The Movie* and was budgeted between $15\u201320 million. Following the critical and financial failure of *Superman IV: The Quest for Peace* and *Masters of the Universe* which were produced by Cannon, the budget for *Spider-Man: The Movie* was cut to $7 million. Joseph Zito was unwilling to compromise and stepped down as director. He was replaced by Albert Pyun who was willing to make the film at a lower budget. The project was cancelled following Cannon's acquisition by Path\u00e9 and Golan's departure from the studio.[35]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn addition to featuring Spider-Man's origin story, it also included reimagined versions of the villains Electro and Sandman; the former was portrayed as a megalomaniacal businessman named Carlton Strand, while the latter was written as Strand's personal bodyguard named Boyd. Cameron's treatment also featured heavy profanity, and a sex scene between Spider-Man and Mary Jane Watson atop the Brooklyn Bridge. Carolco set a $50 million budget for *Spider-Man*, but progress stalled when Golan sued Carolco for attempting to make the film without his involvement.[46] Cameron had recently completed *True Lies* for 20th Century Fox as part of a production deal with the studio. Fox attempted to acquire the film rights to Spider-Man for Cameron but this proved unsuccessful. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n12. **^** \"Rosemary Harris as Aunt May Parker\". *BBC Home*.

Koepp's rewrite substituted the Green Goblin as the main antagonist and added Doctor Octopus as the secondary antagonist.[68] Raimi felt the Green Goblin and the surrogate father-son theme between Norman Osborn and Peter Parker would be more interesting, thus, he dropped Doctor Octopus from the film.[69] In June, Columbia hired Scott Rosenberg to rewrite Koepp's material. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNight Shyamalan, Tony Scott, and David Fincher were considered to direct the project before Raimi was hired as director in 2000.

Raimi had used more traditional special effects in his previous films and learned a lot about using computers during production.[65] Raimi worked hard to plan all the sequences of Spider-Man swinging from buildings, which he described as, \"ballet in the sky.\" The complexity of such sequences meant the budget rose from an initially planned $70\u00a0million to around $100\u00a0million.[27] Shots were made more complicated because of the main characters' individual color schemes, so Spider-Man and the Green Goblin had to be shot separately for effects shots: Spider-Man was shot in front of a greenscreen, while the Green Goblin was shot against bluescreen. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Films | * *Venom* (2018)\n* *Venom: Let There Be Carnage* (2021)\n* *Morbius* (2022)\n* *Madame Web* (2024)\n* *Venom: The Last Dance* (2024)\n* *Kraven the Hunter* (2024)\n |\n| Characters | * Venom\n |\n\n |\n| *Spider-Verse* | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Films | * *Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse* (2018)\n\t+ accolades\n* *Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse* (2023)\n\t+ accolades\n |\n| Short films | * *Spider-Ham: Caught in a Ham* (2019)\n* *The Spider Within: A Spider-Verse Story* (2023)\n |\n| Characters | * Gwen Stacy\n |\n\n |\n\n |\n| Music | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA CGI/spin-off animated series, *Spider-Man: The New Animated Series*, ran on July to September 2003; it was intended to be the continuation of the first film, and was an alternate sequel to the film different from the events of the later sequels.[224]\n\n\n\n## Video game[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Spider-Man (2002 video game)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBeginning in 1975, Marvel Comics made plans to bring their characters to the big screen.

However, the release of *Blade* by New Line Cinema in 1998 and the development of *X-Men* by 20th Century Fox convinced some studios that a Marvel character \"could carry on\" a movie.[50] Marvel would emerge from bankruptcy in 1998 and declare that Menahem Golan's option had expired and that the rights had reverted to them. Marvel would then sell the film rights to Sony Pictures Entertainment, Columbia Pictures' parent company for $7 million.[51] The deal came to effect in March 1999.[52]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWith *Spider-Man* cast, filming was set to begin November 2000 in New York City and on Sony soundstages.

Only *Avengers: Infinity War*, *The Dark Knight*, *Black Panther*, *The Avengers* and *Avengers: Endgame* have sold more tickets than *Spider-Man*. *Spider-Man* was the highest-grossing superhero origin film, a record it held for 15 years until it was surpassed by *Wonder Woman* (2017).[196][197] As of 2020, it is the 12th-highest-grossing superhero film, as well as the 12th-highest-grossing comic book adaptation in general.[198][199][200]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn Los Angeles, locations included the Natural History Museum (for the Columbia University lab where Parker is bitten and receives his powers), the Pacific Electricity Building (the *Daily Bugle* offices) and Greystone Mansion (for the interiors of Norman Osborn's home), the latter of which was the set that was used for *Batman*.[120] In April, 4 of the Spider-Man costumes were stolen, and Sony put up a $25,000 reward for their return.[121] They were recovered after 18 months and a former movie studio security guard and an accomplice were arrested.[122][123][124] Production moved to New York City for two weeks, taking in locations such as the Queensboro Bridge, the exteriors of Columbia University's Low Memorial Library and the New York Public Library, and a rooftop garden in the Rockefeller Center.[109] The crew returned to Los Angeles where production continued, filming wrapped in June 2001.[73] The Flatiron Building was used for the *Daily Bugle*.[73]\n\n\n\n### Design[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nUpon graduating, Peter begins using his abilities to fight injustice, donning a spandex costume and the masked persona of Spider-Man. J. Jonah Jameson, publisher of the *Daily Bugle* newspaper, hires Peter as a freelance photographer, since he is the only person providing clear images of Spider-Man. Upon discovering that Oscorp's board plans to oust him to sell the company to Quest, Norman assassinates them. Jameson dubs the mysterious killer the \"Green Goblin.\"\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe following court case led to the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health to fine Sony $58,805.[111] Raimi rented out a Warner Bros. Studio lot for the set to use to film the upside down kiss scene.[112] Kirsten Dunst said that filming the upside down kiss scene was not so romantic, she said that Maguire could not breathe as water was pouring down into his nose while hanging upside down.[113] Dunst also called shooting the scene \"awful\".[114] Maguire also said that he was gasping for air.[115] He and Franco had tension on set due to Franco's infatuation with Dunst, who was dating Maguire at the time.[116] Randy Savage refused a Stunt Double to do a mid-flip so Savage did the stunt and injured himself.[117] The scene where Peter catches Mary Jane and the food tray was done completely in camera, with Maguire's hand glued to the tray. The scene took 156 takes in 16 hours to accomplish.[118][119]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nStylistically, there was heavy criticism of the Green Goblin's costume, which led *IGN*'s Richard George to comment years later: \"We're not saying the comic book costume is exactly thrilling, but the Goblin armor (the helmet in particular) from *Spider-Man* is almost comically bad... Not only is it not frightening, it prohibits expression.\"[219]\n\n\n*Entertainment Weekly* put \"the kiss in *Spider-Man*\" on its end-of-the-decade \"best-of\" list, saying: \"There's a fine line between romantic and corny. And the rain-soaked smooch between Spider-Man and Mary Jane from 2002 tap-dances right on that line. The reason it works? Even if she suspects he's Peter Parker, she doesn't try to find out. And that's sexy.\"[220]\n\n\n*Empire* magazine ranked *Spider-Man* 437 in its *500 Greatest Movies of All Time* list in 2008.[221]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of accolades received by the 2002\u20132007 Spider-Man film series\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n169. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** Gray, Brandon (May 6, 2002). \"'Spider-Man' Takes Box Office on the Ultimate Spin: $114.8 Million\". *Box Office Mojo*.

Another, which would eventually lead to the final product, featured an enlarged logo on the chest and red stripes going down the sides of the legs.[60] In early development, Acheson experimented with a potential helmet-like design for the suit, which was then scrapped. It was designed as a single piece, including the mask. A hard shell was worn underneath the mask to make the shape of the head look better and to keep the mask tight while keeping the wearer comfortable. For scenes in which Spider-Man would take his mask off, there was an alternate suit where the mask was a separate piece. The webbing, which accented the costume, was cut by computer. The mask eye lenses were designed to have a mirror look.[128]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAt the box office, *Spider-Man* became 2002's highest-grossing film with $407,022,860 in the U.S. and Canada, defeating *The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers* and *Attack of the Clones*.[190] As of 2021, *Spider-Man* ranks as the 37th-highest-grossing film of all time in the U.S. and Canada, not adjusted for inflation. The film also grossed $418,002,176 from its international markets, bringing its worldwide total to $825,025,036[191] making it 2002's third-highest-grossing film behind *The Two Towers* and *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets* and the 58th-highest-grossing film of all time, worldwide.[192] Additionally, it was the highest-grossing Sony film of all time, beating out *Men in Black*.[193][194] *Spider-Man* also dethroned *Batman*'s record for becoming the highest-grossing superhero film of all time.[193][195] The film sold an estimated 69,484,700 tickets in the US.[191] It held the record for most tickets sold by a comic book movie until *The Dark Knight* topped it in 2008. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe next day, Peter finds he is no longer near-sighted and has developed spider-like abilities: he can shoot webs out of his wrists and has quick reflexes, superhuman speed and strength, and a heightened ability to sense danger. Brushing off his Uncle Ben's advice that \"with great power comes great responsibility\", Peter considers buying a car to impress Mary Jane. He enters an underground wrestling event to win the money for it and wins his first match, but is cheated out of his earnings. After Ben is carjacked and killed moments later, Peter pursues the carjacker, only to find out it was a thief he let escape. The thief attempts to flee but dies after falling out a window. Meanwhile, a crazed Norman interrupts a product test by Oscorp's rival Quest Aerospace and kills several people.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPrincipal photography officially began on January 8, 2001, in Culver City, California.[73] After the September 11 attacks happened that year, certain sequences were re-filmed, and a shot of the Twin Towers was removed from the film which can be found on the Sony Stock Footage website.[106][107][108] Sony's Stage 29 was used for Parker's Forest Hills home, and Stage 27 was used for the wrestling sequence where Parker takes on Bonesaw McGraw (Randy Savage). Stage 27 was also used for the complex Times Square sequence where Spider-Man and the Goblin battle for the first time, where a three-story set with a breakaway balcony piece was built. The scene also required shooting in Downey, California.[109] On March 6,[110] 45-year-old construction worker Tim Holcombe was killed when a forklift modified as a construction crane crashed into a construction basket that he was in. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n224. **^** \"Spider-Man on TV\". *IGN*.

Due to *Spider-Man*'s popularity with younger children, this prompted much controversy. The BBFC defended its decision, arguing that the film could have been given a \"15\". Despite this, North Norfolk and Breckland District Councils, in East Anglia, changed it to a \"PG\", and Tameside council, Manchester, denoted it a \"PG-12\". In late August, the BBFC relaxed its policy to \"12A\", leading Sony to re-release the film.[150][151]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Unproduced | * *Silver & Black*\n* *Gambit*\n* Marvel Comics imprints\n* 20th Century Fox\n\t+ *X-Men* film series\n |\n| Franchises | * Marvel Cinematic Universe\n\t+ films\n\t+ Phase One\n\t+ Two\n\t+ Three\n\t+ Four\n\t+ Five\n\t+ Six\n* Sony's Spider-Man Universe\n* *X-Men* film series\n |\n| Related | * Marvel Studios\n |\n| * ![](image) **Category**\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nSam Raimi\n |\n| --- |\n| * Unrealized projects\n |\n| Films directed | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Feature | * *It's Murder!* (1977)\n* *The Evil Dead* (1981)\n* *Crimewave* (1985)\n* *Evil Dead II* (1987)\n* *Darkman* (1990)\n* *Army of Darkness* (1992)\n* *The Quick and the Dead* (1995)\n* *A Simple Plan* (1998)\n* *For Love of the Game* (1999)\n* *The Gift* (2000)\n* *Spider-Man* (2002)\n* *Spider-Man 2* (2004)\n* *Spider-Man 3* (2007)\n* *Drag Me to Hell* (2009)\n* *Oz the Great and Powerful* (2013)\n* *Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness* (2022)\n |\n| Short | * *Within the Woods* (1978)\n* *The Black Ghiandola* (2017)\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAt this point, James Cameron had abandoned the project and began work on *Titanic*.[47] He would reveal in a 1997 interview on *The Howard Stern Show* that he had *Titanic* star Leonardo DiCaprio in mind for the lead role.[48] In 1995, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) acquired 21st Century Film Corporation which had given them access to the previous Spider-Man scripts.
