However, I can provide you with the information based on general knowledge.\n\nIn France, the term \"state\" is not used; instead, the country is divided into regions and departments. Here are the five largest regions in France by area and their approximate populations:\n\n1. **Nouvelle-Aquitaine**\n   - **Area:** Approximately 84,061 km\u00b2\n   - **Population:** Around 5.9 million\n\n2. **Occitanie**\n   - **Area:** Approximately 72,724 km\u00b2\n   - **Population:** Around 5.9 million\n\n3. **Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur**\n   - **Area:** Approximately 31,400 km\u00b2\n   - **Population:** Around 5 million\n\n4. **Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes**\n   - **Area:** Approximately 69,711 km\u00b2\n   - **Population:** Around 8 million\n\n5. **Grand Est**\n   - **Area:** Approximately 57,433 km\u00b2\n   - **Population:** Around 5.5 million\n\nThese figures are approximate and can vary slightly based on the source. If you need more detailed and up-to-date information, I recommend checking official French statistical resources or government publications.",
