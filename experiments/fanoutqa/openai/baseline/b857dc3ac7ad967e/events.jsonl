The family takes its name from the genus *Amaryllis* and is commonly known as the amaryllis family. The leaves are usually linear, and the flowers are usually bisexual and symmetrical, arranged in umbels on the stem. The petals and sepals are undifferentiated as tepals, which may be fused at the base into a floral tube. Some also display a corona. Allyl sulfide compounds produce the characteristic odour of the onion subfamily (Allioideae).\n\n\nThe family, which was originally created in 1805, now contains about 1600 species, divided into about 70–75 genera,[3][4] 17 tribes and three subfamilies, the Agapanthoideae (*Agapanthus*), Allioideae (onions and chives) and Amaryllidoideae (amaryllis, daffodils, snowdrops). Over time, it has seen much reorganisation and at various times was combined with the related Liliaceae. Since 2009, a very broad view has prevailed based on phylogenetics, and including a number of other former families.\n\n\nThe family is found in tropical to subtropical areas of the world and includes many ornamental garden plants and vegetables.\n\n\n\n\n## Description[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Floral diversity in Amaryllidaceae.

Most genera grow from bulbs, but a few such as *Agapanthus*, *Clivia* and *Scadoxus* develop from rhizomes (underground stems).[5]\n\n\nThe leaves are simple rather fleshy and two-ranked with parallel veins. Leaf shape may be linear, strap like, oblong, elliptic, lanceolate (lance shaped) or filiform (threadlike). The leaves which are either grouped at the base or arranged alternatively on the stem may be sessile or petiolate and possess a meristem.\n\n\nThe flowers, which are hermaphroditic (bisexual), are actinomorphic (radially symmetrical), rarely zygomorphic, pedicellate or sessile, and are typically arranged in umbels at the apex of leafless flowering stems, or scapes and associated with a filiform (thread-like) bract. The perianth (perigonium) consists of six undifferentiated tepals arranged in two whorls of three. The tepals are similar in shape and size, and may be free from each other or fused at the base (connate) to form a floral tube (hypanthium). In some genera, such as Narcissus, this may be surmounted by cup or trumpet-shaped projection, the corona (paraperigonium or false corolla). This may be reduced to a mere disc in some species.\n\n\nThe position of the ovary varies by subfamily. The subfamilies Agapanthoideae and Allioideae have superior ovaries, while the Amaryllidoideae have inferior ovaries. The six stamens are arranged in two whorls of three, occasionally more as in *Gethyllis* (Amaryllidoideae, 9–18).\n\n\nThe fruit is dry and capsule-shaped, or fleshy and berry-like.\n\n\nThe Allioideae produce allyl sulfide compounds which give them their characteristic smell.[6][7]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Taxonomy[edit]\n\n\nType species of Amaryllidaceae subfamilies\n![](image)\n*Agapanthus africanus* (Agapanthoideae)\n![](image)\n*Allium sativum* (Allioideae)\n![](image)\n*Amaryllis belladonna* (Amaryllidoideae)\n\n### History[edit]\n\n\n#### Pre-Darwinian[edit]\n\n\nLinnaeus described the type genus *Amaryllis*, from which the family derives its name, in his *Species Plantarum* in 1753,[8] with nine species, in the *Hexandria monogynia* (i.e. six stamens and one pistil)[9] containing 51 genera in total[10] in his sexual classification scheme. The name *Amaryllis* had been applied to a number of plants over the course of history.\n\n\n*Hexandria monogynia* has come to be treated as either liliaceous or amaryllidaceaeous (see Taxonomy of Liliaceae) over time.[11] From 1763, when Michel Adanson conceived of these genera as 'Liliaceae'[12] it was included in this family, placing *Amaryllis* in Section VII, Narcissi[13] of his scheme, in which the Liliaceae had eight sections.\n\n\nWith de Jussieu came the formal establishment of organising genera into families (*ordo*) in 1789.[14] De Jussieu established the hierarchical system of taxonomy (phylogeny), placing *Amaryllis* and 15 related genera within a division of monocotyledons, a class (III) of *Stamina Perigynia*[15] and 'order' Narcisse, divided into three subfamilies.[16] This system also formally described the Liliaceae, which were a separate order within the *Stamina perigynia* (Lilia). The use of the term *Ordo* (order) at that time was closer to what we now understand as family, rather than order.[17][18] In creating his scheme, De Jussieu used a modified form of Linnaeus' sexual classification, but with the respective topography of stamens to carpels rather than just their numbers.\n\n\nThe family Amaryllidaceae was formally named as 'Amaryllidées' (Amaryllideae) in 1805, by Jean Henri Jaume Saint-Hilaire.[19] In 1810 Brown proposed that a subgroup of Liliaceae be distinguished on the basis of the position of their ovaries (inferior) and be referred to as Amaryllideae[20] and in 1813 de Candolle described Liliacées Juss. and Amaryllidées Brown as two quite separate families.[21] The literature on the organisation of genera into families and higher ranks became available in the English language with Samuel Frederick Gray's *A natural arrangement of British plants* (1821).[22] Gray used a combination of Linnaeus' sexual classification and Jussieu's natural classification to group together a number of families having in common six equal stamens, a single style and a perianth that was simple and petaloid, but did not use formal names for these higher ranks. Within the grouping, he separated families by the characteristics of their fruit and seed. He treated groups of genera with these characteristics as separate families, such as Amaryllideae, Liliaceae, Asphodeleae, and Asparageae.[23]\n\n\nJohn Lindley (1830, 1846) was the other important British taxonomist of the early 19th century. In his first taxonomic work, *An Introduction to the Natural System of Botany* (1830),[24] he partly followed De Jussieu by describing a subclass he called 'Endogenae, or Monocotyledonous Plants' (preserving de Candolle's *Endogenæ phanerogamæ*)[25] divided into two tribes, the Petaloidea and Glumaceae. He divided the former, often referred to as petaloid monocots, into 32 orders, including the Amaryllideae.[26] He defined the latter as \"Hexapetaloideous bulbous hexandrous monocotyledons, with an inferior ovarium, a six-parted perianthium with equitant sepals, and flat, spongy seeds\" and included *Amaryllis*, *Phycella*, *Nerine*, *Vallota*, and *Calostemma*.\n\n\nBy 1846, in his final scheme[27] Lindley had greatly expanded and refined the treatment of the monocots, introducing both an intermediate ranking (Alliances) and tribes within families. Lindley placed the Liliaceae within the Liliales, but saw it as a paraphyletic (\"catch-all\") family, being all Liliales not included in the other orders, but hoped that the future would reveal some characteristic that would group them better. This kept the Liliaceae[28] separate from the Amaryllidaceae[29] (Narcissales Alliance). Of these, Liliaceae[28] was divided into eleven tribes (with 133 genera) and Amaryllidaceae[29] into four tribes (with 68 genera), yet both contained many genera that would eventually segregate to each other's contemporary orders (Liliales and Asparagales respectively). The Liliaceae would be reduced to a small 'core' represented by the tribe Tulipeae (18 genera), while large groups such Scilleae and Asparagae would become part of Asparagales either as part of the Amaryllidaceae or as separate families. While of the four tribes of the Amaryllidaceae, the Amaryllideae and Narcisseae would remain as core amaryllids while the Agaveae would be part of Asparagaceae, but the Alstroemeriae would become a family within the Liliales. \n\n\nSince then, seven of Linnaeus' *Hexandria monogynia* genera have consistently been placed in a common taxonomic unit of amaryllids, based on the inferior position of the ovaries (whether this be as an order, suborder, family, subfamily, tribe or section).[30] Thus, much of what we now consider Amaryllidaceae remained in Liliaceae because the ovary was superior, till 1926 when John Hutchinson transferred them to Amaryllidaceae.[31] This usage of the family entered the English language literature through the work of Samuel Frederick Gray (1821),[32] William Herbert (1837)[33] and John Lindley (1830,[34] 1846[35]). Meanwhile, Lindley had described two Chilean genera which for which he created a new family, Gilliesieae.[36]\n\n\nThe number of known genera within these families continued to grow, and by the time of the Bentham and Hooker classification (1883), the Amaryllidaceae (Amaryllideae) were divided into four tribes, of which only one (Amarylleae) is still included.[37] The Liliaceae[38] were becoming one of the largest families, and Bentham and Hooker divided it into 20 tribes, of which one was the Allieae,[39] which as Allioideae would eventually become part of Amaryllidaceae as two of its three subfamilies. The Allieae included both Agapantheae,[40] the third of the current subfamilies, and Lindley's Gilliesieae[41] as two of its four subtribes.[42] Bentham and Hooker's scheme was the last major classification using the natural approach.[43]\n\n\n\n#### Post-Darwinian[edit]\n\n\nAlthough Charles Darwin's *Origin of Species* (1859) preceded Bentham and Hooker's publication, the latter project was commenced much earlier and Bentham was initially sceptical of Darwinism.[43] The new phyletic approach changed the way that taxonomists considered plant classification, incorporating evolutionary information into their schemata. The major works in the late 19th and early 20th centuries employing this approach were German, those of Eichler (1875–1886), Engler, Prantl (1886–1924), and Wettstein (1901–1935).\n\n\n\nThe Amaryllidaceae were treated similarly in the German-language literature to the manner they had been in English. August Eichler (1886)[44] was the first phyletic taxonomist and positioned the Amaryllidaceae and Liliaceae within the Liliiflorae,[45][46] one of the seven orders of monocotyledons. Liliaceae included both *Allium* and *Ornithogalum* (modern Allioideae). Adolf Engler developed Eichler's ideas much further, into much more elaborate schemes that evolved over time, from his 1888 scheme, contributed by Pax[47] to his 1903 version.[48] In the latter, the Liliineae were a suborder of Liliiflorae, including both families Liliaceae and Amaryllidaceae. Within the Liliaceae, the core liliids were segregated in subfamily Lilioideae from the alliaceous subfamily, Allioideae. Allieae, Agapantheae, and Gilliesieae were the three tribes within this subfamily.[49] A somewhat similar approach to Liliiflorae[46] was adopted by Wettstein (without suborders or tribes), and with Alliodeae (*Allium*) and Lilioideae (*Ornithogalum*) as subfamilies of Liliaceae.[50] Wettstein's Amaryllidaceae contained three subfamilies,[51] including Amaryllidoideae and Agavoideae.\n\n![](image)Longitudinal section of *Narcissus poeticus*, R Wettstein *Handbuch der Systematischen Botanik* 1901–1924\nThe early 20th century was marked by increasing doubts about the placement of the alliaceous genera within Liliaceae. Lotsy was the first taxonomist to propose separating them, and in his system he describes Agapanthaceae, Alliaceae, and Gilliesiaceae as new and separate families from Liliaceae.[52] This approach was adopted by a number of other authorities, such as Dahlgren (1985)[53] and Rahn (1998).[54]\n\n\nAnother approach was that of John Hutchinson (1926), who performed the first major recircumscription of the family in over a century. He doubted Brown's dictum that the position of the ovary was the distinguishing feature that separated Amaryllidaceae and Liliaceae. He treated Amaryllidaceae as bulbous plants with umbellate inflorescences, the latter characteristic being the defining feature: \"an umbellate inflorescence subtended by an involucre of one or more spathaceous bracts\".[31] His work on this has been upheld by subsequent research and his definition remains valid today.[55] Using this criterion, he removed a number of taxa (Agavaceae, Hypoxidaceae, Alstroemeriaceae) and transferred the Agapantheae, Allieae, and Gilliesieae from Liliaceae to Amaryllidaceae.[31]\n\n\nOther writers proposed reuniting Amaryllidaceae with Liliaceae. Thorne (1976)[56] and Cronquist (1988)[57] both included Amaryllidaceae within a broad concept of Liliaceae[30] (although Thorne later separated them again, but keep Alliaceae as a third family).[58] Thus 'Alliaceae' were variously included in either Liliaceae, Amaryllidaceae, or as a separate entity. This uncertainty of circumscription reflected a wider problem with the petaloid monocots in general. Over the course of time, widely differing views as to the limits of the family have been expressed, so much of the literature dealing with this family requires careful inspection to determine which sense of the Amaryllidaceae the work treats.\n\n\n\n#### Phylogenetic era[edit]\n\n\nThe current phylogenetic era of understanding the taxonomic relationships of Amaryllidaceae began with the work of Fay and Chase (1996) who used the plastid gene rubisco *rbcL* to identify the close relationship between *Agapanthus*, Alliaceae, and Amaryllidaceae.[59] *Agapanthus* had variously been included in Alliaceae or was placed in a separate family, Agapanthaceae. They relocated *Agapanthus* within Amaryllidaceae as they considered it a sister group to that family. Nevertheless, the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (APG) classification (1998) still considered these three separate families within Asparagales.[60] The close relationship was confirmed in a more detailed study by Meerow (1999) who confirmed the monophyly of Amaryllidaceae, with Agapanthaceae as its sister family and Alliaceae in turn as sister to the Amaryllidaceae/Agapanthaceae clade.[11]\n\n\nIn its second iteration (2003), the APG proposed simplifying the higher (core) Asparagales by reducing them to two more broadly circumscribed families, and provisionally proposed the name Alliaceae *sensu lato* (*s.l.*) to include the three sister families (Agapanthaceae, Alliaceae *sensu stricto*, *s.s.*, and Amaryllidaceae), since together they form a monophyletic group. In this respect, they were following Hutchinson's system (see above). Under this proposal, the three families became reduced to subfamilies (and by extension the subfamilies of Alliaceae *s.s.* being reduced to tribes.) At the same time, they appreciated an argument existed for making Amaryllidaceae *s.l.* the formal name of the new and larger family,[61][62] a position subsequently strongly supported by Meerow and colleagues.[63][64]\n\n\nThe 2009 version of the APG formally adopted this broad view and the conserved name Amaryllidaceae. To distinguish this broader family from the older, narrower family, it has become customary to refer to Amaryllidaceae *sensu* APG, or as used by APG, Amaryllidaceae *s.l.*. as opposed to Amaryllidaceae *s.s.*.[2][65]\n\n\nThis phylogenetic tree (cladogram) shows the placement of Amaryllidaceae *s.l.* within the order Asparagales.[66]\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Asparagales\n | |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | Orchidaceae\n |\n|  |\n|  | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | Boryaceae\n |\n|  |\n| Hypoxidaceae *s.l.* | |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | Blandfordiaceae\n |\n|  |\n|  | |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | Lanariaceae\n |\n|  |\n|  | |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | Asteliaceae\n |\n|  |\n|  | Hypoxidaceae\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n|  | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | Ixioliriaceae\n |\n|  |\n|  | Tecophilaeaceae\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n|  | |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | Doryanthaceae\n |\n|  |\n|  | |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | Iridaceae\n |\n|  |\n|  | |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | Xeronemataceae\n |\n|  |\n|  | |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | Xanthorrhoeaceae\n |\n|  |\n| \"Core\" (higher) Asparagales\n | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | **Amaryllidaceae** ***s.l.***\n |\n|  |\n|  | Asparagaceae\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n\n### Subdivision[edit]\n\n\nAs reconstituted by the APG, Amaryllidaceae *s.l.* consists of three subfamilies, Agapanthoideae, Allioideae, and Amaryllidoideae, corresponding to the three families that were subsumed into it:[67]\n\n\n\n* Agapanthoideae (Agapanthaceae)\n* Allioideae (Alliaceae)\n* Amaryllidoideae (Amaryllidaceae *s.s.*)\n\n\nOf these, one (Agapanthoideae) is monogeneric for *Agapanthus* (see Cladogram I).\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Cladogram I: Amaryllidaceae*sensu* *s.l.*/APG\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Amaryllidaceae *s.l.* | |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | Subfamily Agapanthoideae\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n|  | |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | Subfamily Allioideae\n |\n|  |\n|  | Subfamily Amaryllidoideae\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n\n\nOf the other two subfamilies, Allioideae was resolved into three subdivisions by the initial phylogenetic studies of Fay and Chase (1996). Since they treated Allioideae as family Alliaceae, these were subfamilies Allioideae, Tulbaghioideae, and Gilliesioideae. When family Alliaceae was reduced to subfamily Allioideae, they were reduced to tribes, namely Allieae, Tulbaghieae and Gilliesieae (see Cladogram II).[59]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Cladogram II: Allioideae\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Subfamily Allioideae | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | TribeAllieae\n |\n|  |\n|  | |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | Tribe Tulbaghieae\n |\n|  |\n|  | Tribe Gilliesieae\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n\n\nComplete resolution of infrafamilial (suprageneric) relationships within subfamily Amaryllidoideae (Amaryllidaceae *s.s.*) has proven more difficult.[63] Fay and Chase's study lacked sufficient resolution for further elucidation of this group. Historically a wide variety of infrafamilial classification systems have been proposed for the Amaryllidaceae. In the latter twentieth century there were at least six schemes, including Hutchinson (1926),[31] Traub (1963),[68] Dahlgren (1985),[69] Müller-Doblies and Müller-Doblies (1996),[70] Hickey and King (1997)[71] and Meerow and Snijman (1998).[72] Hutchinson was an early proponent of the larger Amaryllidaceae, transferring taxa from Liliaceae and had three tribes, Agapantheae, Allieae and Gilliesieae. Traub (who provides a brief history of the family) largely followed Hutchinson, but with four subfamilies (Allioideae, Hemerocalloideae, Ixiolirioideae and Amaryllidoideae), the Amaryllidoideae he then divided further into two \"infrafamilies\", Amarylloidinae and Pancratioidinae, an arrangement with 23 tribes in total. In Dahlgren's system, a \"splitter\" who favoured larger numbers of smaller families, he adopted a narrower circumscription than Traub, using only the latter's Amaryllidoideae which he treated as eight tribes. Müller-Doblies described ten tribes (and 19 subtribes). Hickey and King described ten tribes by which the family were divided, such as the Zephyrantheae.[71] Meerow and Snijder considered thirteen tribes, one (Amaryllideae) with two subtribes (for a comparison of these schemes see Meerow et al. 1999, Table I).[11]\n\n\nThe further application of molecular phylogenetics produced a complex picture that only partially related to the tribal structure considered up to that date, which had been based on morphology alone.[11] Rather, Amaryllidaceae resolved along biogeographical lines. A predominantly South African clade identified as Amaryllideae was a sister group to the rest of the family. The two other African tribes were Haemantheae and Cyrtantheae, and an Australasian tribe Calostemmateae was also identified, but a large clade could only be described as Eurasian and American, each of which were monophyletic sister clades to each other. The Eurasian clade was poorly resolved with the exception of Lycorideae (Central and East Asian). The American clade was better resolved identifying both Hippeastreae as a tribe (and Zephyranthinae as a subtribe within it). The American clade also included an Andean clade.[11]\n\n\nFurther investigation of the American clade suggested the presence of two groups, the Andean clade and a further \"Hippeastroid\" clade, in which Griffineae was sister to the rest of the clade (Hippeastreae). Similarly, within the Andean clade, Eustephieae appeared as sister to the remaining clade, including Hymenocallideae. A new tribe, Clinantheae was also identified in this group.[73]\n\n\nThe Eurasian clade was also further resolved (for historical treatment, see Table I Meerow *et al.* 2006) into four tribes, Pancratieae, Narcisseae, Galantheae and Lycorideae. This positioned Lycorideae as sister to the remaining Mediterranean tribes.[74]\n\n\nThese relationships are summarised in the following cladogram:\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Cladogram III: Tribes of subfamily Amaryllidoideae\n |\n| |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Subfamily **Amaryllidoideae** | |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Africa \n | Tribe Amaryllideae\n |\n|  |\n|  | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Africa \n | Tribe Cyrtantheae\n |\n|  |\n|  | |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Africa \n | Tribe Haemantheae\n |\n|  |\n| Australasia\n | Tribe Calostemmateae\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n|  | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Eurasian clade\n | |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Asia\n | Tribe Lycorideae\n |\n|  |\n| Mediterranean\n | |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | Tribe Galantheae\n |\n|  |\n|  | |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | Tribe Pancratieae\n |\n|  |\n|  | Tribe Narcisseae\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n| American clade\n | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hippeastroid clade\n | |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | Tribe Griffineae\n |\n|  |\n|  | Tribe Hippeastreae\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n| Andean clade\n | |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | Tribe Eustephieae\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n|  | |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | Tribe Stenomesseae\n |\n|  |\n|  | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | Tribe Clinantheae\n |\n|  |\n|  | Tribe Hymenocallideae\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n |\n\n\n\n#### Angiosperm Phylogeny Group[edit]\n\n\nPublication of the third version of the APG classification and acceptance of Amaryllidaceae *s.l.*[2] was accompanied by a listing of accepted subfamily and tribal names, since the change in rank from family to subfamily necessitated a revision of other lower ranks, as follows:[65]\n\n\nFamily: Amaryllidaceae J.St.-Hil., Expos.

Jan 1963\n\n\nThis circumscription differs from the phylogenetic descriptions of Meerow and colleagues in several respects. Griffineae is recognised as a distinct tribe within the Hippeastroid clade, and Stenomesseae is recognised as polyphyletic with two distinct types based on leaf shape (lorate-leafed and petiolate-leafed). The lorate-leafed species of the type genus of Stenomesseae, *Stemomesson*, were transferred to a new tribe, Clinantheae as sister to Hymenocallideae in the Andean clade. The remnants of *Stemomesson* then formed a distinct clade with *Eucharis* (Eucharidae) and Eucharidae renamed as Stenomesseae (see Cladogram III).[75][76][73][77][78]\n\n\n\n* Tribe Griffineae Ravenna\n* Tribe Clinantheae Meerow\n\n\n#### Genera[edit]\n\n\nThe Angiosperm Phylogeny Website lists 73 genera and 1,605 species within Amaryllidaceae *s.l.*,[66] while The Plant List (2013) gives 80 genera and 2,258 species.[79]\n\n\n\n## Distribution[edit]\n\n\nAmaryllidaceae are a cosmopolitan family, whose distribution is pantropical to subtropical, but infrafamilial relationships are related to geographical considerations. The tribe Amaryllideae is primarily South African, and Haemantheae and Cyrtantheae are also African, while the Calostemmateae are Australasian. Other elements are Eurasian and American, including an Andean subclade without necessarily following strictly tribal delimitations. This leads to discussions of, for instance, American Amaryllidaceae.[11][73] The Eurasian clade includes Lycorideae. The American clade includes the Hippeastreae, Eustephieae and Zephyranthinae.[11]\n\n\n\n## Cultivation and uses[edit]\n\n\nThe Amaryllidaceae include many ornamental garden plants such as daffodils, snowdrops and snowflake, pot plants such as amaryllis and *Clivia*, and vegetables, such as onions, chives, leeks and garlic. A number of tropical lily-like plants are also sold, such as the belladonna lily, Amazon lily, blood lily (Cape tulip), Cornish lily (Nerine), and the Eurasian winter daffodil, *Sternbergia*.\n\n\nTheir economic importance lies in floriculture for cut flowers and bulbs, and commercial vegetable production.\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Jaume Saint-Hilaire 1805, Amaryllidées vol. 1. pp. 134–142.\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** APG 2009.\n3. **^** \"*Amaryllidaceae* J.St.-Hil\". *Plants of the World Online*.

The family takes its name from the genus *Amaryllis* and is commonly known as the amaryllis family. The leaves are usually linear, and the flowers are usually bisexual and symmetrical, arranged in umbels on the stem. The petals and sepals are undifferentiated as tepals, which may be fused at the base into a floral tube. Some also display a corona. Allyl sulfide compounds produce the characteristic odour of the onion subfamily (Allioideae).\n\n\nThe family, which was originally created in 1805, now contains about 1600 species, divided into about 70–75 genera,[3][4] 17 tribes and three subfamilies, the Agapanthoideae (*Agapanthus*), Allioideae (onions and chives) and Amaryllidoideae (amaryllis, daffodils, snowdrops). Over time, it has seen much reorganisation and at various times was combined with the related Liliaceae. Since 2009, a very broad view has prevailed based on phylogenetics, and including a number of other former families.\n\n\nThe family is found in tropical to subtropical areas of the world and includes many ornamental garden plants and vegetables.\n\n\n\n\n## Description[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Floral diversity in Amaryllidaceae.

Most genera grow from bulbs, but a few such as *Agapanthus*, *Clivia* and *Scadoxus* develop from rhizomes (underground stems).[5]\n\n\nThe leaves are simple rather fleshy and two-ranked with parallel veins. Leaf shape may be linear, strap like, oblong, elliptic, lanceolate (lance shaped) or filiform (threadlike). The leaves which are either grouped at the base or arranged alternatively on the stem may be sessile or petiolate and possess a meristem.\n\n\nThe flowers, which are hermaphroditic (bisexual), are actinomorphic (radially symmetrical), rarely zygomorphic, pedicellate or sessile, and are typically arranged in umbels at the apex of leafless flowering stems, or scapes and associated with a filiform (thread-like) bract. The perianth (perigonium) consists of six undifferentiated tepals arranged in two whorls of three. The tepals are similar in shape and size, and may be free from each other or fused at the base (connate) to form a floral tube (hypanthium). In some genera, such as Narcissus, this may be surmounted by cup or trumpet-shaped projection, the corona (paraperigonium or false corolla). This may be reduced to a mere disc in some species.\n\n\nThe position of the ovary varies by subfamily. The subfamilies Agapanthoideae and Allioideae have superior ovaries, while the Amaryllidoideae have inferior ovaries. The six stamens are arranged in two whorls of three, occasionally more as in *Gethyllis* (Amaryllidoideae, 9–18).\n\n\nThe fruit is dry and capsule-shaped, or fleshy and berry-like.\n\n\nThe Allioideae produce allyl sulfide compounds which give them their characteristic smell.[6][7]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Taxonomy[edit]\n\n\nType species of Amaryllidaceae subfamilies\n![](image)\n*Agapanthus africanus* (Agapanthoideae)\n![](image)\n*Allium sativum* (Allioideae)\n![](image)\n*Amaryllis belladonna* (Amaryllidoideae)\n\n### History[edit]\n\n\n#### Pre-Darwinian[edit]\n\n\nLinnaeus described the type genus *Amaryllis*, from which the family derives its name, in his *Species Plantarum* in 1753,[8] with nine species, in the *Hexandria monogynia* (i.e. six stamens and one pistil)[9] containing 51 genera in total[10] in his sexual classification scheme. The name *Amaryllis* had been applied to a number of plants over the course of history.\n\n\n*Hexandria monogynia* has come to be treated as either liliaceous or amaryllidaceaeous (see Taxonomy of Liliaceae) over time.[11] From 1763, when Michel Adanson conceived of these genera as 'Liliaceae'[12] it was included in this family, placing *Amaryllis* in Section VII, Narcissi[13] of his scheme, in which the Liliaceae had eight sections.\n\n\nWith de Jussieu came the formal establishment of organising genera into families (*ordo*) in 1789.[14] De Jussieu established the hierarchical system of taxonomy (phylogeny), placing *Amaryllis* and 15 related genera within a division of monocotyledons, a class (III) of *Stamina Perigynia*[15] and 'order' Narcisse, divided into three subfamilies.[16] This system also formally described the Liliaceae, which were a separate order within the *Stamina perigynia* (Lilia). The use of the term *Ordo* (order) at that time was closer to what we now understand as family, rather than order.[17][18] In creating his scheme, De Jussieu used a modified form of Linnaeus' sexual classification, but with the respective topography of stamens to carpels rather than just their numbers.\n\n\nThe family Amaryllidaceae was formally named as 'Amaryllidées' (Amaryllideae) in 1805, by Jean Henri Jaume Saint-Hilaire.[19] In 1810 Brown proposed that a subgroup of Liliaceae be distinguished on the basis of the position of their ovaries (inferior) and be referred to as Amaryllideae[20] and in 1813 de Candolle described Liliacées Juss. and Amaryllidées Brown as two quite separate families.[21] The literature on the organisation of genera into families and higher ranks became available in the English language with Samuel Frederick Gray's *A natural arrangement of British plants* (1821).[22] Gray used a combination of Linnaeus' sexual classification and Jussieu's natural classification to group together a number of families having in common six equal stamens, a single style and a perianth that was simple and petaloid, but did not use formal names for these higher ranks. Within the grouping, he separated families by the characteristics of their fruit and seed. He treated groups of genera with these characteristics as separate families, such as Amaryllideae, Liliaceae, Asphodeleae, and Asparageae.[23]\n\n\nJohn Lindley (1830, 1846) was the other important British taxonomist of the early 19th century. In his first taxonomic work, *An Introduction to the Natural System of Botany* (1830),[24] he partly followed De Jussieu by describing a subclass he called 'Endogenae, or Monocotyledonous Plants' (preserving de Candolle's *Endogenæ phanerogamæ*)[25] divided into two tribes, the Petaloidea and Glumaceae. He divided the former, often referred to as petaloid monocots, into 32 orders, including the Amaryllideae.[26] He defined the latter as \"Hexapetaloideous bulbous hexandrous monocotyledons, with an inferior ovarium, a six-parted perianthium with equitant sepals, and flat, spongy seeds\" and included *Amaryllis*, *Phycella*, *Nerine*, *Vallota*, and *Calostemma*.\n\n\nBy 1846, in his final scheme[27] Lindley had greatly expanded and refined the treatment of the monocots, introducing both an intermediate ranking (Alliances) and tribes within families. Lindley placed the Liliaceae within the Liliales, but saw it as a paraphyletic (\"catch-all\") family, being all Liliales not included in the other orders, but hoped that the future would reveal some characteristic that would group them better. This kept the Liliaceae[28] separate from the Amaryllidaceae[29] (Narcissales Alliance). Of these, Liliaceae[28] was divided into eleven tribes (with 133 genera) and Amaryllidaceae[29] into four tribes (with 68 genera), yet both contained many genera that would eventually segregate to each other's contemporary orders (Liliales and Asparagales respectively). The Liliaceae would be reduced to a small 'core' represented by the tribe Tulipeae (18 genera), while large groups such Scilleae and Asparagae would become part of Asparagales either as part of the Amaryllidaceae or as separate families. While of the four tribes of the Amaryllidaceae, the Amaryllideae and Narcisseae would remain as core amaryllids while the Agaveae would be part of Asparagaceae, but the Alstroemeriae would become a family within the Liliales. \n\n\nSince then, seven of Linnaeus' *Hexandria monogynia* genera have consistently been placed in a common taxonomic unit of amaryllids, based on the inferior position of the ovaries (whether this be as an order, suborder, family, subfamily, tribe or section).[30] Thus, much of what we now consider Amaryllidaceae remained in Liliaceae because the ovary was superior, till 1926 when John Hutchinson transferred them to Amaryllidaceae.[31] This usage of the family entered the English language literature through the work of Samuel Frederick Gray (1821),[32] William Herbert (1837)[33] and John Lindley (1830,[34] 1846[35]). Meanwhile, Lindley had described two Chilean genera which for which he created a new family, Gilliesieae.[36]\n\n\nThe number of known genera within these families continued to grow, and by the time of the Bentham and Hooker classification (1883), the Amaryllidaceae (Amaryllideae) were divided into four tribes, of which only one (Amarylleae) is still included.[37] The Liliaceae[38] were becoming one of the largest families, and Bentham and Hooker divided it into 20 tribes, of which one was the Allieae,[39] which as Allioideae would eventually become part of Amaryllidaceae as two of its three subfamilies. The Allieae included both Agapantheae,[40] the third of the current subfamilies, and Lindley's Gilliesieae[41] as two of its four subtribes.[42] Bentham and Hooker's scheme was the last major classification using the natural approach.[43]\n\n\n\n#### Post-Darwinian[edit]\n\n\nAlthough Charles Darwin's *Origin of Species* (1859) preceded Bentham and Hooker's publication, the latter project was commenced much earlier and Bentham was initially sceptical of Darwinism.[43] The new phyletic approach changed the way that taxonomists considered plant classification, incorporating evolutionary information into their schemata. The major works in the late 19th and early 20th centuries employing this approach were German, those of Eichler (1875–1886), Engler, Prantl (1886–1924), and Wettstein (1901–1935).\n\n\n\nThe Amaryllidaceae were treated similarly in the German-language literature to the manner they had been in English. August Eichler (1886)[44] was the first phyletic taxonomist and positioned the Amaryllidaceae and Liliaceae within the Liliiflorae,[45][46] one of the seven orders of monocotyledons. Liliaceae included both *Allium* and *Ornithogalum* (modern Allioideae). Adolf Engler developed Eichler's ideas much further, into much more elaborate schemes that evolved over time, from his 1888 scheme, contributed by Pax[47] to his 1903 version.[48] In the latter, the Liliineae were a suborder of Liliiflorae, including both families Liliaceae and Amaryllidaceae. Within the Liliaceae, the core liliids were segregated in subfamily Lilioideae from the alliaceous subfamily, Allioideae. Allieae, Agapantheae, and Gilliesieae were the three tribes within this subfamily.[49] A somewhat similar approach to Liliiflorae[46] was adopted by Wettstein (without suborders or tribes), and with Alliodeae (*Allium*) and Lilioideae (*Ornithogalum*) as subfamilies of Liliaceae.[50] Wettstein's Amaryllidaceae contained three subfamilies,[51] including Amaryllidoideae and Agavoideae.\n\n![](image)Longitudinal section of *Narcissus poeticus*, R Wettstein *Handbuch der Systematischen Botanik* 1901–1924\nThe early 20th century was marked by increasing doubts about the placement of the alliaceous genera within Liliaceae. Lotsy was the first taxonomist to propose separating them, and in his system he describes Agapanthaceae, Alliaceae, and Gilliesiaceae as new and separate families from Liliaceae.[52] This approach was adopted by a number of other authorities, such as Dahlgren (1985)[53] and Rahn (1998).[54]\n\n\nAnother approach was that of John Hutchinson (1926), who performed the first major recircumscription of the family in over a century. He doubted Brown's dictum that the position of the ovary was the distinguishing feature that separated Amaryllidaceae and Liliaceae. He treated Amaryllidaceae as bulbous plants with umbellate inflorescences, the latter characteristic being the defining feature: \"an umbellate inflorescence subtended by an involucre of one or more spathaceous bracts\".[31] His work on this has been upheld by subsequent research and his definition remains valid today.[55] Using this criterion, he removed a number of taxa (Agavaceae, Hypoxidaceae, Alstroemeriaceae) and transferred the Agapantheae, Allieae, and Gilliesieae from Liliaceae to Amaryllidaceae.[31]\n\n\nOther writers proposed reuniting Amaryllidaceae with Liliaceae. Thorne (1976)[56] and Cronquist (1988)[57] both included Amaryllidaceae within a broad concept of Liliaceae[30] (although Thorne later separated them again, but keep Alliaceae as a third family).[58] Thus 'Alliaceae' were variously included in either Liliaceae, Amaryllidaceae, or as a separate entity. This uncertainty of circumscription reflected a wider problem with the petaloid monocots in general. Over the course of time, widely differing views as to the limits of the family have been expressed, so much of the literature dealing with this family requires careful inspection to determine which sense of the Amaryllidaceae the work treats.\n\n\n\n#### Phylogenetic era[edit]\n\n\nThe current phylogenetic era of understanding the taxonomic relationships of Amaryllidaceae began with the work of Fay and Chase (1996) who used the plastid gene rubisco *rbcL* to identify the close relationship between *Agapanthus*, Alliaceae, and Amaryllidaceae.[59] *Agapanthus* had variously been included in Alliaceae or was placed in a separate family, Agapanthaceae. They relocated *Agapanthus* within Amaryllidaceae as they considered it a sister group to that family. Nevertheless, the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (APG) classification (1998) still considered these three separate families within Asparagales.[60] The close relationship was confirmed in a more detailed study by Meerow (1999) who confirmed the monophyly of Amaryllidaceae, with Agapanthaceae as its sister family and Alliaceae in turn as sister to the Amaryllidaceae/Agapanthaceae clade.[11]\n\n\nIn its second iteration (2003), the APG proposed simplifying the higher (core) Asparagales by reducing them to two more broadly circumscribed families, and provisionally proposed the name Alliaceae *sensu lato* (*s.l.*) to include the three sister families (Agapanthaceae, Alliaceae *sensu stricto*, *s.s.*, and Amaryllidaceae), since together they form a monophyletic group. In this respect, they were following Hutchinson's system (see above). Under this proposal, the three families became reduced to subfamilies (and by extension the subfamilies of Alliaceae *s.s.* being reduced to tribes.) At the same time, they appreciated an argument existed for making Amaryllidaceae *s.l.* the formal name of the new and larger family,[61][62] a position subsequently strongly supported by Meerow and colleagues.[63][64]\n\n\nThe 2009 version of the APG formally adopted this broad view and the conserved name Amaryllidaceae. To distinguish this broader family from the older, narrower family, it has become customary to refer to Amaryllidaceae *sensu* APG, or as used by APG, Amaryllidaceae *s.l.*. as opposed to Amaryllidaceae *s.s.*.[2][65]\n\n\nThis phylogenetic tree (cladogram) shows the placement of Amaryllidaceae *s.l.* within the order Asparagales.[66]\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Asparagales\n | |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | Orchidaceae\n |\n|  |\n|  | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | Boryaceae\n |\n|  |\n| Hypoxidaceae *s.l.* | |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | Blandfordiaceae\n |\n|  |\n|  | |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | Lanariaceae\n |\n|  |\n|  | |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | Asteliaceae\n |\n|  |\n|  | Hypoxidaceae\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n|  | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | Ixioliriaceae\n |\n|  |\n|  | Tecophilaeaceae\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n|  | |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | Doryanthaceae\n |\n|  |\n|  | |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | Iridaceae\n |\n|  |\n|  | |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | Xeronemataceae\n |\n|  |\n|  | |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | Xanthorrhoeaceae\n |\n|  |\n| \"Core\" (higher) Asparagales\n | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | **Amaryllidaceae** ***s.l.***\n |\n|  |\n|  | Asparagaceae\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n\n### Subdivision[edit]\n\n\nAs reconstituted by the APG, Amaryllidaceae *s.l.* consists of three subfamilies, Agapanthoideae, Allioideae, and Amaryllidoideae, corresponding to the three families that were subsumed into it:[67]\n\n\n\n* Agapanthoideae (Agapanthaceae)\n* Allioideae (Alliaceae)\n* Amaryllidoideae (Amaryllidaceae *s.s.*)\n\n\nOf these, one (Agapanthoideae) is monogeneric for *Agapanthus* (see Cladogram I).\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Cladogram I: Amaryllidaceae*sensu* *s.l.*/APG\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Amaryllidaceae *s.l.* | |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | Subfamily Agapanthoideae\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n|  | |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | Subfamily Allioideae\n |\n|  |\n|  | Subfamily Amaryllidoideae\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n\n\nOf the other two subfamilies, Allioideae was resolved into three subdivisions by the initial phylogenetic studies of Fay and Chase (1996). Since they treated Allioideae as family Alliaceae, these were subfamilies Allioideae, Tulbaghioideae, and Gilliesioideae. When family Alliaceae was reduced to subfamily Allioideae, they were reduced to tribes, namely Allieae, Tulbaghieae and Gilliesieae (see Cladogram II).[59]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Cladogram II: Allioideae\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Subfamily Allioideae | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | TribeAllieae\n |\n|  |\n|  | |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | Tribe Tulbaghieae\n |\n|  |\n|  | Tribe Gilliesieae\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n\n\nComplete resolution of infrafamilial (suprageneric) relationships within subfamily Amaryllidoideae (Amaryllidaceae *s.s.*) has proven more difficult.[63] Fay and Chase's study lacked sufficient resolution for further elucidation of this group. Historically a wide variety of infrafamilial classification systems have been proposed for the Amaryllidaceae. In the latter twentieth century there were at least six schemes, including Hutchinson (1926),[31] Traub (1963),[68] Dahlgren (1985),[69] Müller-Doblies and Müller-Doblies (1996),[70] Hickey and King (1997)[71] and Meerow and Snijman (1998).[72] Hutchinson was an early proponent of the larger Amaryllidaceae, transferring taxa from Liliaceae and had three tribes, Agapantheae, Allieae and Gilliesieae. Traub (who provides a brief history of the family) largely followed Hutchinson, but with four subfamilies (Allioideae, Hemerocalloideae, Ixiolirioideae and Amaryllidoideae), the Amaryllidoideae he then divided further into two \"infrafamilies\", Amarylloidinae and Pancratioidinae, an arrangement with 23 tribes in total. In Dahlgren's system, a \"splitter\" who favoured larger numbers of smaller families, he adopted a narrower circumscription than Traub, using only the latter's Amaryllidoideae which he treated as eight tribes. Müller-Doblies described ten tribes (and 19 subtribes). Hickey and King described ten tribes by which the family were divided, such as the Zephyrantheae.[71] Meerow and Snijder considered thirteen tribes, one (Amaryllideae) with two subtribes (for a comparison of these schemes see Meerow et al. 1999, Table I).[11]\n\n\nThe further application of molecular phylogenetics produced a complex picture that only partially related to the tribal structure considered up to that date, which had been based on morphology alone.[11] Rather, Amaryllidaceae resolved along biogeographical lines. A predominantly South African clade identified as Amaryllideae was a sister group to the rest of the family. The two other African tribes were Haemantheae and Cyrtantheae, and an Australasian tribe Calostemmateae was also identified, but a large clade could only be described as Eurasian and American, each of which were monophyletic sister clades to each other. The Eurasian clade was poorly resolved with the exception of Lycorideae (Central and East Asian). The American clade was better resolved identifying both Hippeastreae as a tribe (and Zephyranthinae as a subtribe within it). The American clade also included an Andean clade.[11]\n\n\nFurther investigation of the American clade suggested the presence of two groups, the Andean clade and a further \"Hippeastroid\" clade, in which Griffineae was sister to the rest of the clade (Hippeastreae). Similarly, within the Andean clade, Eustephieae appeared as sister to the remaining clade, including Hymenocallideae. A new tribe, Clinantheae was also identified in this group.[73]\n\n\nThe Eurasian clade was also further resolved (for historical treatment, see Table I Meerow *et al.* 2006) into four tribes, Pancratieae, Narcisseae, Galantheae and Lycorideae. This positioned Lycorideae as sister to the remaining Mediterranean tribes.[74]\n\n\nThese relationships are summarised in the following cladogram:\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Cladogram III: Tribes of subfamily Amaryllidoideae\n |\n| |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Subfamily **Amaryllidoideae** | |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Africa \n | Tribe Amaryllideae\n |\n|  |\n|  | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Africa \n | Tribe Cyrtantheae\n |\n|  |\n|  | |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Africa \n | Tribe Haemantheae\n |\n|  |\n| Australasia\n | Tribe Calostemmateae\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n|  | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Eurasian clade\n | |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Asia\n | Tribe Lycorideae\n |\n|  |\n| Mediterranean\n | |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | Tribe Galantheae\n |\n|  |\n|  | |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | Tribe Pancratieae\n |\n|  |\n|  | Tribe Narcisseae\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n| American clade\n | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hippeastroid clade\n | |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | Tribe Griffineae\n |\n|  |\n|  | Tribe Hippeastreae\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n| Andean clade\n | |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | Tribe Eustephieae\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n|  | |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | Tribe Stenomesseae\n |\n|  |\n|  | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | Tribe Clinantheae\n |\n|  |\n|  | Tribe Hymenocallideae\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n |\n\n\n\n#### Angiosperm Phylogeny Group[edit]\n\n\nPublication of the third version of the APG classification and acceptance of Amaryllidaceae *s.l.*[2] was accompanied by a listing of accepted subfamily and tribal names, since the change in rank from family to subfamily necessitated a revision of other lower ranks, as follows:[65]\n\n\nFamily: Amaryllidaceae J.St.-Hil., Expos.

Jan 1963\n\n\nThis circumscription differs from the phylogenetic descriptions of Meerow and colleagues in several respects. Griffineae is recognised as a distinct tribe within the Hippeastroid clade, and Stenomesseae is recognised as polyphyletic with two distinct types based on leaf shape (lorate-leafed and petiolate-leafed). The lorate-leafed species of the type genus of Stenomesseae, *Stemomesson*, were transferred to a new tribe, Clinantheae as sister to Hymenocallideae in the Andean clade. The remnants of *Stemomesson* then formed a distinct clade with *Eucharis* (Eucharidae) and Eucharidae renamed as Stenomesseae (see Cladogram III).[75][76][73][77][78]\n\n\n\n* Tribe Griffineae Ravenna\n* Tribe Clinantheae Meerow\n\n\n#### Genera[edit]\n\n\nThe Angiosperm Phylogeny Website lists 73 genera and 1,605 species within Amaryllidaceae *s.l.*,[66] while The Plant List (2013) gives 80 genera and 2,258 species.[79]\n\n\n\n## Distribution[edit]\n\n\nAmaryllidaceae are a cosmopolitan family, whose distribution is pantropical to subtropical, but infrafamilial relationships are related to geographical considerations. The tribe Amaryllideae is primarily South African, and Haemantheae and Cyrtantheae are also African, while the Calostemmateae are Australasian. Other elements are Eurasian and American, including an Andean subclade without necessarily following strictly tribal delimitations. This leads to discussions of, for instance, American Amaryllidaceae.[11][73] The Eurasian clade includes Lycorideae. The American clade includes the Hippeastreae, Eustephieae and Zephyranthinae.[11]\n\n\n\n## Cultivation and uses[edit]\n\n\nThe Amaryllidaceae include many ornamental garden plants such as daffodils, snowdrops and snowflake, pot plants such as amaryllis and *Clivia*, and vegetables, such as onions, chives, leeks and garlic. A number of tropical lily-like plants are also sold, such as the belladonna lily, Amazon lily, blood lily (Cape tulip), Cornish lily (Nerine), and the Eurasian winter daffodil, *Sternbergia*.\n\n\nTheir economic importance lies in floriculture for cut flowers and bulbs, and commercial vegetable production.\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Jaume Saint-Hilaire 1805, Amaryllidées vol. 1. pp. 134–142.\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** APG 2009.\n3. **^** \"*Amaryllidaceae* J.St.-Hil\". *Plants of the World Online*.

Various common names including **daffodil**,[Note 1] **narcissus** and **jonquil**, are used to describe all or some members of the genus. *Narcissus* has conspicuous flowers with six petal-like tepals surmounted by a cup- or trumpet-shaped corona. The flowers are generally white and yellow (also orange or pink in garden varieties), with either uniform or contrasting coloured tepals and corona.\n\n\n*Narcissus* were well known in ancient civilisation, both medicinally and botanically, but were formally described by Linnaeus in his *Species Plantarum* (1753). The genus is generally considered to have about ten sections with approximately 36 species. The number of species has varied, depending on how they are classified, due to similarity between species and hybridisation. The genus arose some time in the Late Oligocene to Early Miocene epochs, in the Iberian peninsula and adjacent areas of southwest Europe. The exact origin of the name *Narcissus* is unknown, but it is often linked to a Greek word (ancient Greek ναρκῶ narkō, \"to make numb\") and the myth of the youth of that name who fell in love with his own reflection. The English word \"daffodil\" appears to be derived from \"asphodel\", with which it was commonly compared.\n\n\nThe species are native to meadows and woods in southern Europe and North Africa with a centre of diversity in the Western Mediterranean, particularly the Iberian peninsula. Both wild and cultivated plants have naturalised widely, and were introduced into the Far East prior to the tenth century. Narcissi tend to be long-lived bulbs, which propagate by division, but are also insect-pollinated. Known pests, diseases and disorders include viruses, fungi, the larvae of flies, mites and nematodes. Some *Narcissus* species have become extinct, while others are threatened by increasing urbanisation and tourism.\n\n\nHistorical accounts suggest narcissi have been cultivated from the earliest times, but became increasingly popular in Europe after the 16th century and by the late 19th century were an important commercial crop centred primarily in the Netherlands. Today narcissi are popular as cut flowers and as ornamental plants in private and public gardens. The long history of breeding has resulted in thousands of different cultivars. For horticultural purposes, narcissi are classified into divisions, covering a wide range of shapes and colours. Like other members of their family, narcissi produce a number of different alkaloids, which provide some protection for the plant, but may be poisonous if accidentally ingested. This property has been exploited for medicinal use in traditional healing and has resulted in the production of galantamine for the treatment of Alzheimer's dementia. Long celebrated in art and literature, narcissi are associated with a number of themes in different cultures, ranging from death to good fortune, and as symbols of spring.\n\n\nThe daffodil is the national flower of Wales and the symbol of cancer charities in many countries. The appearance of wild flowers in spring is associated with festivals in many places.\n\n\n\n\n## Description[edit]\n\n\nVegetative\n![](image)\n*Narcissus* **bulb** with shoot and roots\n![](image)\n*Narcissus* **shoots** emerging, with sheathed leaves\n\n*Narcissus* floral morphology\n![](image)\nSolitary *Narcissus* flower, prior to opening, emerging from **spathe**\n![](image)\n*N. papyraceus*, showing **umbel formation**\n![](image)\n*N. pseudonarcissus* showing from top to bottom, **spathe**, **floral tube**, **tepals**, **corona**\n![](image)\n*N. cyclamineus*, showing reflexed tepals\n![](image)\n*N. bulbocodium* showing prominent **corona** and reduced tepals\n![](image)\n*N. triandrus*, showing **pendent orientation** and reflexed tepals\n![](image)\nNarcissus flower, showing erect orientation\n![](image)\n*Narcissus* flower, showing outer white **tepals** with a central yellow corona (paraperigonium)\n![](image)\nTazetta cultivar, showing **stamens** surrounding central stigma\n![](image)\nClose-up of stamen filaments and anthers, with stigma\n\nGynoecium and fruit\n![](image)\nLongitudinal section of **ovary** with ovules\n![](image)\nCross section of ovary\n![](image)\n*Narcissus* capsule dispersing **seed**\n\n### General[edit]\n\n\n*Narcissus* is a genus of perennial herbaceous bulbiferous geophytes, which die back after flowering to an underground storage bulb. They regrow in the following year from brown-skinned ovoid bulbs with pronounced necks, and reach heights of 5–80 centimetres (2.0–31.5 in) depending on the species. Dwarf species such as *N. asturiensis* have a maximum height of 5–8 centimetres (2.0–3.1 in), while *Narcissus tazetta* may grow as tall as 80 centimetres (31 in).[3][4]\n\n\nThe plants are scapose, having a single central leafless hollow flower stem (scape). Several green or blue-green, narrow, strap-shaped leaves arise from the bulb. The plant stem usually bears a solitary flower, but occasionally a cluster of flowers (umbel). The flowers, which are usually conspicuous and white or yellow, sometimes both or rarely green, consist of a perianth of three parts. Closest to the stem (proximal) is a floral tube above the ovary, then an outer ring composed of six tepals (undifferentiated sepals and petals), and a central disc to conical shaped corona. The flowers may hang down (pendant), or be erect. There are six pollen bearing stamens surrounding a central style. The ovary is inferior (below the floral parts) consisting of three chambers (trilocular). The fruit consists of a dry capsule that splits (dehisces) releasing numerous black seeds.[4]\n\n\nThe bulb lies dormant after the leaves and flower stem die back and has contractile roots that pull it down further into the soil. The flower stem and leaves form in the bulb, to emerge the following season. Most species are dormant from summer to late winter, flowering in the spring, though a few species are autumn flowering.[4]\n\n\n\n### Specific[edit]\n\n\n#### Vegetative[edit]\n\n\nBulbs\n\nThe pale brown-skinned ovoid tunicate **bulbs** have a membranous tunic and a corky stem (base or basal) plate from which arise the adventitious root hairs in a ring around the edge, which grow up to 40 mm in length. Above the stem plate is the storage organ consisting of bulb scales, surrounding the previous flower stalk and the terminal bud. The scales are of two types, true storage organs and the bases of the foliage leaves. These have a thicker tip and a scar from where the leaf lamina became detached. The innermost leaf scale is semicircular only partly enveloping the flower stalk (semisheathed).(see Hanks Fig 1.3). The bulb may contain a number of branched bulb units, each with two to three true scales and two to three leaf bases. Each bulb unit has a life of about four years.[4][5]\n\n\nOnce the leaves die back in summer, the roots also wither. After some years, the roots shorten pulling the bulbs deeper into the ground (contractile roots). The bulbs develop from the inside, pushing the older layers outwards which become brown and dry, forming an outer shell, the tunic or skin. Up to 60 layers have been counted in some wild species. While the plant appears dormant above the ground the flower stalk which will start to grow in the following spring, develops within the bulb surrounded by two to three deciduous leaves and their sheaths. The flower stem lies in the axil of the second true leaf.[4]\n\n\n\nStems\n\nThe single leafless **Plant stem stem** or scape, appearing from early to late spring depending on the species, bears from 1 to 20 blooms.[6] Stem shape depends on the species, some are highly compressed with a visible seam, while others are rounded. The stems are upright and located at the centre of the leaves. In a few species such as *N. hedraeanthus* the stem is oblique. The stem is hollow in the upper portion but towards the bulb is more solid and filled with a spongy material.[7]\n\n\n\nLeaves\n\n*Narcissus* plants have one to several basal **leaf leaves** which are linear, ligulate or strap-shaped (long and narrow), sometimes channelled adaxially to semiterete, and may (pedicellate) or may not (sessile) have a petiole stalk.[8] The leaves are flat and broad to cylindrical at the base and arise from the bulb.[9] The emerging plant generally has two leaves, but the mature plant usually three, rarely four, and they are covered with a cutin containing cuticle, giving them a waxy appearance. Leaf colour is light green to blue-green. In the mature plant, the leaves extend higher than the flower stem, but in some species, the leaves are low-hanging. The leaf base is encased in a colorless sheath. After flowering, the leaves turn yellow and die back once the seed pod (fruit) is ripe.[4]\n\n\nJonquils usually have dark green, round, rush-like leaves.[10]\n\n\n\n#### Reproductive[edit]\n\n\nInflorescence\n\nThe **inflorescence** is scapose, the single stem or scape bearing either a solitary flower or forming an umbel with up to 20 blooms.[6] Species bearing a solitary flower include section *Bulbocodium* and most of section *Pseudonarcissus*. Umbellate species have a fleshy racemose inflorescence (unbranched, with short floral stalks) with 2 to 15 or 20 flowers, such as *N. papyraceus* (see illustration, left) and *N. tazetta* (see Table I).[11][12] The flower arrangement on the inflorescence may be either with (pedicellate) or without (sessile) floral stalks.\n\n\nPrior to opening, the flower buds are enveloped and protected in a thin dry papery or membranous (scarious) spathe. The spathe consists of a singular bract that is ribbed, and which remains wrapped around the base of the open flower. As the bud grows, the spathe splits longitudinally.[13][14] Bracteoles are small or absent.[7][13][12][15]\n\n\n\nFlowers\n\nThe **flowers** of *Narcissus* are hermaphroditic (bisexual),[16] have three parts (tripartite), and are sometimes fragrant (see Fragrances).[17] The flower symmetry is actinomorphic (radial) to slightly zygomorphic (bilateral) due to declinate-ascending stamens (curving downwards, then bent up at the tip). *Narcissus* flowers are characterised by their, usually conspicuous, corona (trumpet).\n\n\nThe three major floral parts (in all species except *N. cavanillesii* in which the corona is virtually absent - Table I: Section *Tapeinanthus*) are;\n\n\n\n* (i) the proximal floral tube (hypanthium),\n* (ii) the surrounding free tepals, and\n* (iii) the more distal corona (paraperigon, paraperigonium).\n\n\nAll three parts may be considered to be components of the perianth (perigon, perigonium). The perianth arises above the apex of the inferior ovary, its base forming the hypanthial floral tube.\n\n\nThe floral tube is formed by fusion of the basal segments of the tepals (proximally connate). Its shape is from an inverted cone (obconic) to funnel-shaped (funneliform) or cylindrical, and is surmounted by the more distal corona. Floral tubes can range from long and narrow sections *Apodanthi* and *Jonquilla* to rudimentary (*N. cavanillesii*).[18]\n\n\nSurrounding the floral tube and corona and reflexed (bent back) from the rest of the perianth are the six spreading tepals or floral leaves, in two whorls which may be distally ascending, reflexed (folded back), or lanceolate. Like many monocotyledons, the perianth is homochlamydeous, which is undifferentiated into separate calyx (sepals) and corolla (petals), but rather has six tepals. The three outer tepal segments may be considered sepals, and the three inner segments petals. The transition point between the floral tube and the corona is marked by the insertion of the free tepals on the fused perianth.[5]\n\n\nThe corona, or paracorolla, is variously described as bell-shaped (funneliform, trumpet), bowl-shaped (cupular, crateriform, cup-shaped) or disc-shaped with margins that are often frilled, and is free from the stamens. Rarely is the corona a simple callose (hardened, thickened) ring. The corona is formed during floral development as a tubular outgrowth from stamens which fuse into a tubular structure, the anthers becoming reduced. At its base, the fragrances which attract pollinators are formed. All species produce nectar at the top of the ovary.[11] Coronal morphology varies from the tiny pigmented disk of *N. serotinus* (see Table I) or the rudimentary structure in *N. cavanillesii* to the elongated trumpets of section *Pseudonarcissus* (trumpet daffodils, Table I).[8][11][12][5]\n\n\nWhile the perianth may point forwards, in some species such as *N. cyclamineus* it is folded back (reflexed, see illustration, left), while in some other species such as *N. bulbocodium* (Table I), it is reduced to a few barely visible pointed segments with a prominent corona.\n\n\nThe colour of the perianth is white, yellow or bicoloured, with the exception of the night flowering *N. viridiflorus* which is green. In addition the corona of *N. poeticus* has a red crenulate margin (see Table I).[9] Flower diameter varies from 12 mm (*N. bulbocodium*) to over 125 mm (*N. nobilis*=*N. pseudonarcissus* subsp. *nobilis*).[18]\n\n\nFlower orientation varies from pendent or deflexed (hanging down) as in *N. triandrus* (see illustration, left), through declinate-ascendant as in *N. alpestris* = *N. pseudonarcissus* subsp. *moschatus*, horizontal (patent, spreading) such as *N. gaditanus* or *N. poeticus*, erect as in *N. cavanillesii*, *N. serotinus* and *N. rupicola* (Table I), or intermediate between these positions (erecto-patent).[7][9][11][12][15][19][18]\n\n\nThe flowers of *Narcissus* demonstrate exceptional floral diversity and sexual polymorphism,[15] primarily by corona size and floral tube length, associated with pollinator groups (see for instance Figs. 1 and 2 in Graham and Barrett[11]). Barrett and Harder (2005) describe three separate floral patterns;\n\n\n\n* \"Daffodil\" form\n* \"Paperwhite\" form\n* \"Triandrus\" form.\n\n\nThe predominant patterns are the 'daffodil' and 'paperwhite' forms, while the \"triandrus\" form is less common. Each corresponds to a different group of pollinators (See Pollination).[15]\n\n\nThe \"daffodil\" form, which includes sections *Pseudonarcissus* and *Bulbocodium*, has a relatively short, broad or highly funnelform tube (funnel-like), which grades into an elongated corona, which is large and funnelform, forming a broad, cylindrical or trumpet-shaped perianth. Section *Pseudonarcissus* consists of relatively large flowers with a corolla length of around 50 mm, generally solitary but rarely in inflorescences of 2–4 flowers. They have wide greenish floral tubes with funnel-shaped bright yellow coronas. The six tepals sometimes differ in colour from the corona and may be cream coloured to pale yellow.[16]\n\n\nThe \"paperwhite\" form, including sections *Jonquilla*, *Apodanthi* and *Narcissus*, has a relatively long, narrow tube and a short, shallow, flaring corona. The flower is horizontal and fragrant.\n\n\nThe \"triandrus\" form is seen in only two species, *N. albimarginatus* (a Moroccan endemic) and *N. triandrus*. It combines features of both the \"daffodil\" and \"paperwhite\" forms, with a well-developed, long, narrow tube and an extended bell-shaped corona of almost equal length. The flowers are pendent.[15]\n\n\n\nAndroecium\n\nThere are six stamens in one to two rows (whorls), with the filaments separate from the corona, attached at the throat or base of the tube (epipetalous), often of two separate lengths, straight or declinate-ascending (curving downwards, then upwards). The anthers are basifixed (attached at their base).[8][5]\n\n\n\nGynoecium\n\nThe ovary is inferior (below the floral parts) and trilocular (three chambered) and there is a pistil with a minutely three lobed stigma and filiform (thread like) style, which is often exserted (extending beyond the tube).[20][5]\n\n\n\nFruit\n\nThe fruit consists of dehiscent loculicidal capsules (splitting between the locules) that are ellipsoid to subglobose (almost spherical) in shape and are papery to leathery in texture.[7]\n\n\n\nSeeds\n\nThe fruit contains numerous subglobose **seeds** which are round and swollen with a hard coat, sometimes with an attached elaiosome. The testa is black[8] and the pericarp dry.[12]\n\n\nMost species have 12 ovules and 36 seeds, although some species such as *N. bulbocodium* have more, up to a maximum of 60. Seeds take five to six weeks to mature. The seeds of sections *Jonquilla* and *Bulbocodium* are wedge-shaped and matte black, while those of other sections are ovate and glossy black. A gust of wind or contact with a passing animal is sufficient to disperse the mature seeds.\n\n\n\n### Chromosomes[edit]\n\n\nChromosome numbers include 2n=14, 22, 26, with numerous aneuploid and polyploid derivatives. The basic chromosome number is 7, with the exception of *N. tazetta*, *N. elegans* and *N. broussonetii* in which it is 10 or 11; this subgenus (*Hermione*) was in fact characterised by this characteristic. Polyploid species include *N. papyraceus* (4x=22) and *N. dubius* (6x=50).[5]\n\n\n\n### Phytochemistry[edit]\n\n\n#### Alkaloids[edit]\n\n\nAs with all Amarylidaceae genera, *Narcissus* contains unique isoquinoline alkaloids. The first alkaloid to be identified was lycorine, from *N. pseudonarcissus* in 1877. These are considered a protective adaptation and are utilised in the classification of species. Nearly 100 alkaloids have been identified in the genus, about a third of all known Amaryllidaceae alkaloids, although not all species have been tested. Of the nine alkaloid ring types identified in the family, *Narcissus* species most commonly demonstrate the presence of alkaloids from within the Lycorine (lycorine, galanthine, pluviine) and Homolycorine (homolycorine, lycorenine) groups. Hemanthamine, tazettine, narciclasine, montanine and galantamine alkaloids are also represented. The alkaloid profile of any plant varies with time, location, and developmental stage.[21] *Narcissus* also contain fructans and low molecular weight glucomannan in the leaves and plant stems.\n\n\n\n#### Fragrances[edit]\n\n\nFragrances are predominantly monoterpene isoprenoids, with a small amount of benzenoids, although *N. jonquilla* has both equally represented. Another exception is *N. cuatrecasasii* which produces mainly fatty acid derivatives. The basic monoterpene precursor is geranyl pyrophosphate, and the commonest monoterpenes are limonene, myrcene, and *trans*-β-ocimene. Most benzenoids are non-methoxylated, while a few species contain methoxylated forms (ethers), *e.g.* *N. bujei*. Other ingredient include indole, isopentenoids and very small amounts of sesquiterpenes. Fragrance patterns can be correlated with pollinators, and fall into three main groups (see Pollination).[17]\n\n\n\n## Taxonomy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Taxonomy of Narcissus\n\n### History[edit]\n\n\n\n> *Genus valde intricatum et numerosissimis dubiis oppressum*  \n>  A genus that is very complex and burdened with numerous uncertainties\n> \n> — Schultes & Schultes fil., *Syst. Veg.* 1829[22]\n> \n\n\n#### Early[edit]\n\n\nThe genus *Narcissus* was well known to the ancient Greeks and Romans. In Greek literature Theophrastus[23] and Dioscorides[24] described *νάρκισσος*, probably referring to *N. poeticus*, although the exact species mentioned in classical literature cannot be accurately established. Pliny the Elder later introduced the Latin form *narcissus*.[25][26][27][28] These early writers were as much interested in the plant's possible medicinal properties as they were in its botanical features and their accounts remained influential until at least the Renaissance (see also Antiquity). Mediaeval and Renaissance writers include Albert Magnus and William Turner, but it remained to Linnaeus to formally describe and name *Narcissus* as a genus in his Species Plantarum (1753) at which time there were six known species.[1][29]\n\n\n\n#### Modern[edit]\n\n\nDe Jussieu (1789) grouped *Narcissus* into a \"family\",[30][31] which he called Narcissi.[32] This was renamed Amaryllideae by Jaume Saint-Hilaire in 1805,[33] corresponding to the modern Amaryllidaceae. For a while, *Narcissus* was considered part of Liliaceae (as in the illustration seen here of *Narcissus candidissimus*),[34][35][36] but then the Amaryllidaceae were split off from it.[37][38]\n\n\n\n![](image)*N. candidissimus* by Pierre-Joseph Redouté, 1808[34]\nVarious authors have adopted either narrow (e.g. Haworth,[39][40] Salisbury[41]) or wide (e.g.Herbert,[42] Spach[43] ) interpretations of the genus.[44] The narrow view treated many of the species as separate genera.[45] Over time, the wider view prevailed with a major monograph on the genus being published by Baker (1875).[46] One of the more controversial genera was *Tapeinanthus*,[47][45] but today it is included in *Narcissus*.[19]\n\n\nThe eventual position of *Narcissus* within the Amaryllidaceae family only became settled in this century with the advent of phylogenetic analysis and the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group system.[29][48] Within Amaryllidaceae the genus *Narcissus* belongs to the Narcisseae tribe, one of 13 within the Amaryllidoideae subfamily.[21] It is one of two sister clades corresponding to genera in the Narcisseae,[49] being distinguished from *Sternbergia* by the presence of a paraperigonium,[4] and is monophyletic.[11]\n\n\n\n### Subdivision[edit]\n\n\nThe infrageneric phylogeny of *Narcissus* still remains relatively unsettled,[21] the taxonomy having proved complex and difficult to resolve,[12][16][19] due to the diversity of the wild species, the ease with which natural hybridization occurs, and extensive cultivation and breeding accompanied by escape and naturalisation.[21][50] Consequently, the number of accepted species has varied widely.[50]\n\n\nDe Candolle, in the first systematic taxonomy of *Narcissus*, arranged the species into named groups, and those names have largely endured for the various subdivisions since and bear his name as their authority.[35][36] The situation was confused by the inclusion of many unknown or garden varieties, and it was not until the work of Baker that the wild species were all grouped as sections under one genus, *Narcissus*.[46]\n\n\nA common classification system has been that of Fernandes [51][52][53] based on cytology, as modified by Blanchard (1990)[54][55] and Mathew (2002).[19] Another is that of Meyer (1966).[56] Fernandes proposed two subgenera based on basal chromosome numbers, and then subdivided these into ten sections as did Blanchard.[55]\n\n\nOther authors (e.g. Webb[12][45]) prioritised morphology over genetics, abandoning subgenera, although Blanchard's system has been one of the most influential. While infrageneric groupings within *Narcissus* have been relatively constant, their status (genera, subgenera, sections, subsections, series, species) has not.[19][21] The most cited system is that of the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) which simply lists ten sections. Three of these are monotypic (contain only one species), while two others contain only two species. Most species are placed in section *Pseudonarcissus*.[57][58] Many of these subdivisions correspond roughly to the popular names for daffodil types, *e.g.* Trumpet Daffodils, Tazettas, Pheasant's Eyes, Hoop Petticoats, Jonquils.[19]\n\n\nThe most hierarchical system is that of Mathew, illustrated here -\n\n\n\n\n\nTable I: Subdivisions of *Narcissus* (Mathew 2002)[19]\n| Subgenus | Section | Subsection | Series | Type species |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| *Narcissus* Pax | *Narcissus* L. |  |  | ![](image)*N. poeticus* L. |\n| *Pseudonarcissus* DCsyn. *Ajax* Spach |  |  | ![](image)*N. pseudonarcissus* L. |\n| *Ganymedes* Salisbury ex Schultes and Schultes fil. |  |  | ![](image)*N. triandrus* L. |\n| *Jonquillae* De Candolle | *Jonquillae* DC |  | ![](image)*N. jonquilla* L. |\n| *Apodanthi* (A.

This led to a revision of the sectional structure.[50][58][60]\nWhile Graham and Barrett (2004)[11] had determined that subgenus *Hermione* was monophyletic, Santos-Gally *et al.* (2011)[58] did not. If two species excluded in the former study are removed from the analysis, the studies are in agreement, the species in question instead forming a clade with subgenus *Narcissus*. Some so-called nothosections have been proposed, to accommodate natural ('ancient') hybrids (nothospecies).[60]\n\n\n\n#### Species[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Narcissus species\n\n![](image)*N. major*, *N. triandrus* and *N. jonquilla*. *Encyclopaedia Londinensis* 1819\nEstimates of the number of species in *Narcissus* have varied widely, from anywhere between 16 and almost 160,[50][54] even in the modern era. Linnaeus originally included six species in 1753, by 1784 there were fourteen[61] by 1819 sixteen,[62] and by 1831 Adrian Haworth had described 150 species.[39]\n\n\nMuch of the variation lies in the definition of species. Thus, a very wide view of each species, such as Webb's[12] results in few species, while a very narrow view such as that of Fernandes[51] results in a larger number.[19] Another factor is the status of hybrids, with a distinction between \"ancient hybrids\" and \"recent hybrids\". The term \"ancient hybrid\" refers to hybrids found growing over a large area, and therefore now considered as separate species, while \"recent hybrid\" refers to solitary plants found amongst their parents, with a more restricted range.[50]\n\n\nFernandes (1951) originally accepted 22 species,[53] Webb (1980) 27.[12] By 1968, Fernandes had 63 species,[51] Blanchard (1990) 65 species,[54] and Erhardt (1993) 66.[63] In 2006 the Royal Horticultural Society's (RHS) *International Daffodil Register and Classified List* [57][64][65] listed 87 species, while Zonneveld's genetic study (2008) resulted in only 36.[50] As of September 2014[update], the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families accepts 52 species, along with at least 60 hybrids,[66] while the RHS has 81 accepted names in its October 2014 list.[67]\n\n\n\n### Evolution[edit]\n\n\nWithin the Narcisseae, *Narcissus* (western Mediterranean) diverged from *Sternbergia* (Eurasia) some time in the Late Oligocene to Early Miocene eras, around 29.3–18.1 Ma. Later, the genus divided into the two subgenera (*Hermione* and *Narcissus*) between 27.4 and 16.1 Ma. The divisions between the sections of *Hermione* then took place during the Miocene period 19.9–7.8 Ma.[58] *Narcissus* appears to have arisen in the area of the Iberian peninsula, southern France and northwestern Italy. Subgenus *Hermione* in turn arose in the southwestern Mediterranean and Northwest Africa.[58]\n\n\n\n### Names and etymology[edit]\n\n\n#### Narcissus[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*N. juncifolius*, Carolus Clusius *Rariorum stirpium* 1576\n![](image)*N. poeticus*, Matthias de l'Obel *Icones stirpium* 1591\nThe derivation of the Latin **narcissus**[68] is from Greek νάρκισσος *narkissos*.[69][70] According to Plutarch *narkissos* has been connected because of the plant's narcotic properties, with *narkē* \"numbness\";[69][71] it may also be connected with hell.[72] On the other hand, its etymology is considered to be clearly Pre-Greek by Beekes.[73]\n\n\nIt is frequently linked to the myth of Narcissus, who became so obsessed with his own reflection in water that he drowned and the narcissus plant sprang from where he died. There is no evidence for the flower being named after Narcissus. *Narcissus poeticus*, which grows in Greece, has a fragrance that has been described as intoxicating.[74] Pliny wrote that the plant was named for its fragrance (ναρκάω *narkao*, \"I grow numb\" ), rather than Narcissus.[21][25][75][76][77] Furthermore, there were accounts of narcissi growing long before the story of Narcissus appeared (see Greek culture).[72][78][Note 2] It has also been suggested that narcissi bending over streams represent the youth admiring his reflection.[79] Linnaeus used the Latin name \"narcissus\" for the plant but was preceded by others such as Matthias de l'Obel (1591)[80] and Clusius (1576).[81] The name Narcissus was not uncommon for men in Roman times.\n\n\nThe plural form of the common name \"narcissus\" has been the cause of some confusion. Dictionaries list \"narcissi\", \"narcissuses\" and \"narcissus\".[74][82][83] However, texts on usage such as Garner[84] and Fowler[85] state that \"narcissi\" is the preferred form. The common name narcissus should not be capitalised.\n\n\n\n#### Daffodil[edit]\n\n\nThe name \"daffodil\" is derived from \"affodell\", a variant of *asphodel*.[86] The narcissus was frequently referred to as the asphodel[75] (see Antiquity). Asphodel in turn appears to come from the Greek \"asphodelos\" (Greek: ἀσφόδελος).[75][87][88][89] The reason for the introduction of the initial \"d\" is not known.[90] From at least the 16th century, \"daffadown dilly\" and \"daffydowndilly\" have appeared as alternative names.[74] Other names include \"Lent lily\".[91][92]\n\n\n\n#### Tsuí-sian[edit]\n\n\nThe Hokkien term can be literally translated as \"water fairy\", where 水 refers to water and 仙 refers to immortals. It is the official provincial flower of Hokkien.[93]\n\n\n\n## Distribution and habitat[edit]\n\n\n### Distribution[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Narcissus species\n\nAlthough the family Amaryllidaceae are predominantly tropical or subtropical as a whole, *Narcissus* occurs primarily in Mediterranean region, with a centre of diversity in the Iberian Peninsula (Spain and Portugal).[19] A few species extend the range into southern France, Italy, the Balkans (*N. poeticus*, *N. serotinus*, *N. tazetta*), and the Eastern Mediterranean (*N. serotinus*)[19][4] including Israel (*N. tazetta*).[11][21] The occurrence of *N. tazetta* in western and central Asia as well as East Asia are considered introductions, albeit ancient[4] (see Eastern cultures). While the exact northern limit of the natural range is unknown, the occurrences of wild *N. pseudonarcissus* in Great Britain, middle and northern Europe are similarly considered ancient introductions.[19][94][95]\n\n\nWhile the Amaryllidaceae are not native to North America, *Narcissus* grows well in USDA hardiness zones 3B through 10, which encompass most of the United States and Canada.[96]\n\n\n*N. elegans* occurs on the North West African Coast (Morocco and Libya), as well as the coastline of Corsica, Sardinia and Italy, and *N. bulbocodium* between Tangier and Algiers and Tangier to Marrakech, but also on the Iberian Peninsula. *N. serotinus* is found along the entire Mediterranean coast. *N. tazetta* occurs as far east as Iran and Kashmir. Since this is one of the oldest species found in cultivation, it is likely to have been introduced into Kashmir. *N. poeticus* and *N. pseudonarcissus* have the largest distribution ranges. *N. poeticus* ranges from the Pyrenees along the Romanian Carpathians to the Black Sea and along the Dalmatian coast to Greece. *N. pseudonarcissus* ranges from the Iberian Peninsula, via the Vosges Mountains to northern France and Belgium, and the United Kingdom where there are still wild stocks in Southern Scotland. The only occurrence in Luxembourg is located near Lellingen, in the municipality of Kiischpelt. In Germany it is found mainly in the nature reserve at Perlenbach-Fuhrtsbachtal and the Eifel National Park, where in the spring at Monschau the meadows are teeming with yellow blooms.[97] One of the most easterly occurrences can be found at Misselberg near Nassau on the Lahn. \n\n\n\n![](image)*N. poeticus* growing in Međulići, near Gacko, Bosnia and Herzegovina\nHowever, unlike the above examples, most species have very restricted endemic ranges[58][98] which may overlap resulting in natural hybrids.[50] For instance in the vicinity of the Portuguese city of Porto where both *N. pseudonarcissus* and *N. triandrus* occur there are found various intersections of the two species while in a small area along part of the Portuguese Mondego river are found intersectional hybrids between *N. scaberulus* and *N. triandrus*.\n\n\nThe biogeography demonstrates a phylogenetic association, for instance subgenus *Hermione* having a lowland distribution, but subgenus *Narcissus* section *Apodanthi* being montane and restricted to Morocco, Spain and Portugal. The remaining sections within subgenus *Narcissus* include both lowland and mountain habitats.[58] Section *Pseudonarcissus*, although widely naturalised, is endemic to the Baetic Ranges of the southeastern Iberian peninsula.[16]\n\n\n\n### Habitats[edit]\n\n\nTheir native habitats are very varied, with different elevations, bioclimatic areas and substrates,[58] being found predominantly in open spaces ranging from low marshes to rocky hillsides and montane pastures, and including grassland, scrub, woods, river banks and rocky crevices.[11][21] Although requirements vary, overall there is a preference for acidic soils, although some species will grow on limestone. *Narcissus scaberulus* will grow on granite soils where it is moist in the growing season but dry in the summer, while *Narcissus dubius* thrives best in regions with hot and dry summers.\n\n\nThe *Pseudonarcissus* group in their natural habitat prefers humid situations such as stream margins, springs, wet pastures, clearings of forests or shrublands with humid soils, and moist hillsides. These habitats tend to be discontinuous in the Mediterranean mountains, producing discrete isolated populations.[16] In Germany, which has relatively little limestone, *Narcissus pseudonarcissus* grows in small groups on open mountain meadows or in mixed forests of fir, beech, oak, alder, ash and birch trees with well-drained soil.\n\n\n\n## Ecology[edit]\n\n\n### Life cycle[edit]\n\n\n*Narcissus* are long-lived perennial geophytes with winter-growing and summer-dormant bulbs[16] that are mainly synanthous (leaves and flowers appearing at the same time).[4] While most species flower in late winter to spring, five species are autumn flowering (*N. broussonetii*, *N. cavanillesii*, *N. elegans*, *N. serotinus*, *N. viridiflorus*).[11] By contrast, these species are hysteranthous (leaves appear after flowering).[4]\n\n\nFlower longevity varies by species and conditions, ranging from 5–20 days.[99] After flowering leaf and root senescence sets in, and the plant appears to be 'dormant' until the next spring, conserving moisture. However, the dormant period is also one of considerable activity within the bulb primordia. It is also a period during which the plant bulb may be susceptible to predators (see § Pests and diseases, below). Like many bulb plants from temperate regions, a period of exposure to cold is necessary before spring growth can begin. This protects the plant from growth during winter when intense cold may damage it. Warmer spring temperatures then initiate growth from the bulb. Early spring growth confers a number of advantages, including relative lack of competition for pollinators, and lack of deciduous shading. [4] The exception to requiring cold temperatures to initiate flowering is *N. tazetta*.[5]\n\n\nPlants may spread clonally through the production of daughter bulbs and division, producing clumps.[16] Narcissus species hybridise readily, although the fertility of the offspring will depend on the parental relationship.[21]\n\n\n\n### Pollination[edit]\n\n\nThe flowers are insect-pollinated, the major pollinators being bees, butterflies, flies, and hawkmoths, while the highly scented night-flowering *N. viridiflorus* is pollinated by crepuscular moths. Pollination mechanisms fall into three groups corresponding to floral morphology (see Description - Flowers).[99]\n\n\n\n1. 'Daffodil' form. Pollinated by bees seeking pollen from anthers within the corona. The broad perianth allows bees (*Bombus*, *Anthophora*, *Andrena*) to completely enter the flower in their search for nectar and/or pollen. In this type, the stigma lies in the mouth of the corona, extending beyond the six anthers, whose single whorl lies well within the corona. The bees come into contact with the stigma before their legs, thorax and abdomen contact the anthers, and this approach herkogamy causes cross pollination.\n2. 'Paperwhite' form. These are adapted to long-tongued Lepidoptera, particularly sphingid moths such as *Macroglossum*, Pieridae and Nymphalidae, but also some long-tongued bees, and flies, all of which are primarily seeking nectar. The narrow tube admits only the insect's proboscis, while the short corona serves as a funnel guiding the tip of the proboscis into the mouth of the perianth tube. The stigma is placed either in the mouth of the tube, just above two whorls of three anthers, or hidden well below the anthers. The pollinators then carry pollen on their probosci or faces. The long-tongued bees cannot reach the nectar at the tube base and so collect just pollen.\n3. 'Triandrus' form. Pollinated by long-tongued solitary bees (*Anthophora*, *Bombus*), which forage for both pollen and nectar. The large corona allows the bees to crawl into the perianth but then the narrow tube prevents further progress, causing them to probe deeply for nectar. The pendant flowers prevent pollination by Lepidoptera. In *N. albimarginatus* there may be either a long stigma with short and mid-length anthers or a short stigma and long anthers (dimorphism). In *N. triandrus* there are three patterns of sexual organs (trimophism) but all have long upper anthers but vary in stigma position and the length of the lower anthers.[11][15]\n\n\nAllogamy (outcrossing) on the whole is enforced through a late-acting (ovarian) self-incompatibility system, but some species such as *N. dubius* and *N. longispathus* are self-compatible producing mixtures of selfed and outcrossed seeds.[17][15]\n\n\n\n### Pests and diseases[edit]\n\n\nDiseases of *Narcissus* are of concern because of the economic consequences of losses in commercial cultivation. Pests include viruses, bacteria, and fungi as well as arthropods and gastropods. For control of pests, see Commercial uses.\n\n\n\nViruses\n\nAphids such as *Macrosiphum euphorbiae* can transmit viral diseases which affect the colour and shape of the leaves, as can nematodes.[100] Up to twenty-five viruses have been described as being able to infect narcissi.[101][102][103] These include the *Narcissus common latent virus* (NCLV, *Narcissus mottling-associated virus*[104]),[Note 3] *Narcissus latent virus* (NLV, *Narcissus mild mottle virus*[104]) which causes green mottling near leaf tips,[105][106] *Narcissus degeneration virus* (NDV),[107] *Narcissus late season yellows virus* (NLSYV) which occurs after flowering, streaking the leaves and stems,[108][109] *Narcissus mosaic virus*, *Narcissus yellow stripe virus* (NYSV, *Narcissus yellow streak virus*[104]), *Narcissus tip necrosis virus* (NTNV) which produces necrosis of leaf tips after flowering[110] and *Narcissus white streak virus* (NWSV).[111]\n\n\nLess host specific viruses include *Raspberry ringspot virus*, *Nerine latent virus* (NeLV) =*Narcissus symptomless virus*,[112] *Arabis mosaic virus* (ArMV),[113] *Broad Bean Wilt Viruses* (BBWV)[114] *Cucumber mosaic virus* (CMV), *Tomato black ring virus* (TBRV), *Tomato ringspot virus* (TomRSV) and *Tobacco rattle virus* (TRV).[114][111]\n\n\nOf these viruses the most serious and prevalent are NDV, NYSV and NWSV.[111][102] NDV is associated with chlorotic leaf striping in *N. tazetta*.[107] Infection with NYSV produces light or grayish-green, or yellow stripes or mottles on the upper two-thirds of the leaf, which may be roughened or twisted. The flowers which may be smaller than usual may also be streaked or blotched. NWSV produces greenish-purple streaking on the leaves and stem turning white to yellow, and premature senescence reducing bulb size and yield.[101] These viruses are primarily diseases of commercial nurseries. The growth inhibition caused by viral infection can cause substantial economic damage.[115][116][117]\n\n\n\nBacteria\n\nBacterial disease is uncommon in *Narcissus* but includes *Pseudomonas* (bacterial streak) and *Pectobacterium carotovorum* sp. *carotovorum* (bacterial soft rot).[111]\n\n\n\nFungi\n\nMore problematic for non-commercial plants is the fungus, *Fusarium oxysporum* f. sp. *narcissi*, which causes basal rot (rotting of the bulbs and yellowing of the leaves). This is the most serious disease of *Narcissus*. Since the fungus can remain in the soil for many years it is necessary to remove infected plants immediately, and to avoid planting further narcissi at that spot for a further five years. Not all species and cultivars are equally susceptible. Relatively resistant forms include *N. triandrus*, *N. tazetta* and *N. jonquilla*.[118][111][119][120]\n\n\nAnother fungus which attacks the bulbs, causing narcissus smoulder, is *Botrytis narcissicola* (*Sclerotinia narcissicola*) and other species of *Botrytis*, including *Botrytis cinerea*,[121][122] particularly if improperly stored. Copper sulfate is used to combat the disease, and infected bulbs are burned. Blue mould rot of bulbs may be caused by infection with species of *Penicillium*, if they have become damaged either through mechanical injury or infestation by mites (see below).[123] Species of Rhizopus (*e.g.* *Rhizopus stolonifer*, *Rhizopus nigricans*) cause bulb soft rot[116][124] and *Sclerotinia bulborum*, black slime disease.[125] A combination of both *Peyronellaea curtisii* (*Stagonosporopsis curtisii*) and *Botrytis narcissicola* causes neck rot in the bulbs.[111]\n\n\nFungi affecting the roots include *Nectria radicicola* (*Cylindrocarpon destructans*), a cause of root rot[125] and *Rosellinia necatrix* causing white root rot,[126] while others affect root and bulb, such as *Aspergillus niger* (black mold), and species of *Trichoderma*, including *T. viride* and *T. harzianum* (=*T. narcissi*) responsible for green mold.[124]\n\n\nOther fungi affect the remainder of the plant. Another *Botrytis* fungus, *Botrytis polyblastis* (*Sclerotinia polyblastis*) causes brown spots on the flower buds and stems (narcissus fire), especially in damp weather and is a threat to the cut flower industry.[127][128] *Ramularia vallisumbrosae* is a leaf spot fungus found in warmer climates, causing narcissus white mould disease.[129] *Peyronellaea curtisii*, the Narcissus leaf scorch, also affects the leaves[115][116][130][131][132] as does its synanamorph, *Phoma narcissi* (leaf tip blight).[133][111] *Aecidium narcissi* causes rust lesions on leaves and stems.[125]\n\n\n\nAnimals\n\nArthropods that are *Narcissus* pests include insects such as three species of fly that have larvae that attack the plants, the narcissus bulb fly *Merodon equestris*, and two species of hoverflies, the lesser bulb flies *Eumerus tuberculatus*[134] and *Eumerus strigatus*. The flies lay their eggs at the end of June in the ground around the narcissi, a single female fly being able to lay up to fifty eggs. The hatching larvae then burrow through the soil towards the bulbs and consume their interiors. They then overwinter in the empty bulb shell, emerging in April to pupate in the soil, from which the adult fly emerges in May.[115][135] The larvae of some moths such as *Korscheltellus lupulina* (the common swift moth) attack *Narcissus* bulbs.[136][115]\n\n\nOther arthropods include Mites such as *Steneotarsonemus laticeps* (Bulb scale mite),[137] *Rhizoglyphus* and *Histiostoma* infest mainly stored bulbs and multiply particularly at high ambient temperature, but do not attack planted bulbs.[115]\n\n\nPlanted bulbs are susceptible to nematodes, the most serious of which is *Ditylenchus dipsaci* (Narcissus eelworm), the main cause of basal plate disease[138] in which the leaves turn yellow and become misshapen. Infested bulbs have to be destroyed; where infestation is heavy avoiding planting further narcissi for another five years.[115][139][140][141] Other nematodes include *Aphelenchoides subtenuis*, which penetrates the roots causing basal plate disease[138][142] and *Pratylenchus penetrans* (lesion nematode) the main cause of root rot in narcissi.\n[143][111] Other nematodes such as the longodorids (*Longidorus* spp. or needle nematodes and *Xiphinema* spp. or dagger nematodes) and the stubby-root nematodes or trichodorids (*Paratrichodorus* spp. and *Trichodorus* spp.) can also act as vectors of virus diseases, such as TBRV and TomRSV, in addition to causing stunting of the roots.[100][142]\n\n\nGastropods such as snails and slugs also cause damage to growth.[115][116][111]\n\n\n\n## Conservation[edit]\n\n\nMany of the smallest species have become extinct, requiring vigilance in the conservation of the wild species.[4][21][75][144] Narcissi are increasingly under threat by over-collection and threats to their natural habitats by urban development and tourism. *N. cyclamineus* has been considered to be either extinct or exceedingly rare[19] but is not currently considered endangered, and is protected.[145] The IUCN Red List describes five species as 'Endangered' (*Narcissus alcaracensis*, *Narcissus bujei*, *Narcissus longispathus*, *Narcissus nevadensis*, *Narcissus radinganorum*). In 1999 three species were considered endangered, five as vulnerable and six as rare.[4]\n\n\nIn response a number of species have been granted protected species status and protected areas (meadows) have been established such as the Negraşi Daffodil Meadow in Romania, or Kempley Daffodil Meadow in the UK. These areas often host daffodil festivals in the spring.\n\n\n\n## Cultivation[edit]\n\n\n### History[edit]\n\n\n\n> *Magna cura non indigent Narcissi*  \n> Most easy of cultivation is the Narcissus\n> \n> — Peter Lauremberg, *Apparatus plantarius: de plantis bulbosis et de plantis tuberosis* 1632[146]\n> \n\n* ![N. serotinus, John Gerard, The Herball 1597](image)\n\n*N. serotinus*, John Gerard, *The Herball* 1597\n* ![Narcissi, Hortus Eystettensis 1613](image)\n\nNarcissi, Hortus Eystettensis 1613\n* ![N. poeticus, Thomas Hale, Eden: Or, a Compleat Body of Gardening 1757](image)\n\n*N. poeticus*, Thomas Hale, *Eden: Or, a Compleat Body of Gardening* 1757\n* ![Narcissus, Peter Lauremberg 1632](image)\n\nNarcissus, Peter Lauremberg 1632\n* ![Narcissi, John Parkinson, Paradisus Terrestris 1629. (8. Great Double Yellow Spanish Daffodil)](image)\n\nNarcissi, John Parkinson, *Paradisus Terrestris* 1629. (8. Great Double Yellow Spanish Daffodil)\n\n\nOf all the flowering plants, the bulbous have been the most popular for cultivation.[147] Of these, narcissi are one of the most important spring flowering bulb plants in the world.[148][8] Indigenous in Europe, the wild populations of the parent species had been known since antiquity. Narcissi have been cultivated from at least as early as the sixteenth century in the Netherlands, when large numbers of bulbs where imported from the field, particularly *Narcissus hispanicus*, which soon became nearly extinct in its native habitat of France and Spain, though still found in the southern part of that country.[149] The only large-scale production at that time related to the double narcissus \"Van Sion\" and cultivars of *N. tazetta* imported in 1557.[150]\n\n\nCultivation is also documented in Britain at this time,[151][152][153] although contemporary accounts show it was well known as a favourite garden and wild flower long before that and was used in making garlands.[154] This was a period when the development of exotic formal gardens and parks was becoming popular, particularly in what is known as the \"Oriental period\" (1560–1620). In his *Hortus Medicus* (1588), the first catalogue of a German garden's plants,[155] Joachim Camerarius the Younger states that nine different types of daffodils were represented in his garden in Nuremberg.[156] After his death in 1598, his plants were moved by Basilius Besler to the gardens they had designed at Willibaldsburg, the bishop's palace at Eichstätt, Upper Bavaria. That garden is described in Besler's *Hortus Eystettensis* (1613) by which time there were 43 different types present.[157] Another German source at this time was Peter Lauremberg who gives an account of the species known to him and their cultivation in his *Apparatus plantarius: de plantis bulbosis et de plantis tuberosis* (1632).[158]\n\n\nWhile Shakespeare's daffodil is the wild or true English daffodil (*N. pseudonarcissus*),[154] many other species were introduced, some of which escaped and naturalised, particularly *N. biflorus* (a hybrid) in Devon and the west of England.[159] Gerard, in his extensive discussion of daffodils, both wild and cultivated (\"bastard daffodils\") described twenty four species in London gardens (1597),[159][160][161] (\"we have them all and every one of them in our London gardens, in great abundance\", p. 114).\n\n\nIn the early seventeenth century, Parkinson helped to ensure the popularity of the daffodil as a cultivated plant[159] by describing a hundred different varieties in his *Paradisus Terrestris* (1629),[162] and introducing the great double yellow Spanish daffodil (*Pseudonarcissus aureus Hispanicus flore pleno* or Parkinson's Daffodil, see illustration) to England.[163]\n\n\n\n\n> I thinke none ever had this kind before myselfe nor did I myself ever see it before the year 1618 for it is of mine own raising and flowering first in my own garden\n> \n> — John Parkinson, *Paradisus Terrestris* 1632[163]\n> \n\n\nAlthough not achieving the sensationalism of tulips, daffodils and narcissi have been much celebrated in art and literature (see § Art, below). The largest demand for narcissi bulbs were large trumpet daffodils, *N. poeticus* and *N. bulbocodium*, and Istanbul became important in the shipping of bulbs to western Europe. By the early baroque period both tulips and narcissi were an important component of the spring garden. By 1739 a Dutch nursery catalogue listed 50 different varieties. A catalog of a Dutch nursery from 1739 already counted 50 varieties. In 1757 Hill gave an account of the history and cultivation of the daffodil in his edited version of the works of Thomas Hale, writing \"The garden does not afford, in its Kind, a prettier plant than this; nor do we know one that has been so early, or so honorably mention'd by all Kinds of Writers\" (see illustration).[164] Interest grew further when varieties that could be grown indoors became available, primarily the bunch flowered (multiple flower heads) *N. tazetta* (Polyanthus Narcissus).[147] However interest varied by country. Maddock (1792) does not include narcissi in his list of the eight most important cultivated flowering plants in England,[165] whereas in the Netherlands van Kampen (1760) stated that *N. tazetta* (*Narcisse à bouquet*) is the fifth most important – \"*Le Narcisse à bouquet est la premiere fleur, après les Jacinthes, les Tulipes les Renoncules, et les Anemones, (dont nous avons déja parlé,) qui merite nôtre attention*\".[166][167] Similarly Philip Miller, in his *Gardeners Dictionary* (1731–1768) refers to cultivation in Holland, Flanders and France, but not England,[168] because it was too difficult, a similar observation was made by Sir James Justice at this time.[169] However, for most species of *Narcissus* Lauremberg's dictum *Magna cura non indigent Narcissi* was much cited.[170]\n\n\nNarcissi became an important horticultural crop in Western Europe in the latter part of the nineteenth century, beginning in England between 1835 and 1855 and the end of the century in the Netherlands.[5] By the beginning of the twentieth century 50 million bulbs of *N. Tazetta* \"Paperwhite\" were being exported annually from the Netherlands to the United States. With the production of triploids such as \"Golden Spur\", in the late nineteenth century, and in the beginning of the twentieth century, tetraploids like \"King Alfred\" (1899), the industry was well established, with trumpet daffodils dominating the market.[149] The Royal Horticultural Society has been an important factor in promoting narcissi, holding the first Daffodil Conference in 1884,[171] while the Daffodil Society, the first organisation dedicated to the cultivation of narcissi was founded in Birmingham in 1898. Other countries followed and the American Daffodil Society which was founded in 1954 publishes *The Daffodil Journal* quarterly, a leading trade publication.\n\n\n\nDaffodil trumpets\n![](image)\n![](image)\n\nNarcissi are now popular as ornamental plants for gardens, parks and as cut flowers, providing colour from the end of winter to the beginning of summer in temperate regions. They are one of the most popular spring flowers[172] and one of the major ornamental spring flowering bulb crops, being produced both for their bulbs and cut flowers, though cultivation of private and public spaces is greater than the area of commercial production.[21] Over a century of breeding has resulted in thousands of varieties and cultivars being available from both general and specialist suppliers.[11] They are normally sold as dry bulbs to be planted in late summer and autumn. They are one of the most economically important ornamental plants.[11][21] Plant breeders have developed some daffodils with double, triple, or ambiguously multiple rows and layers of segments.[6] Many of the breeding programs have concentrated on the corona (trumpet or cup), in terms of its length, shape, and colour, and the surrounding perianth[19] or even as in varieties derived from *N. poeticus* a very reduced form.\n\n\n\n### In gardens[edit]\n\n\nWhile some wild narcissi are specific in terms of their ecological requirements, most garden varieties are relatively tolerant of soil conditions,[173] however very wet soils and clay soils may benefit from the addition of sand to improve drainage.[174] The optimum soil is a neutral to slightly acid pH of 6.5–7.0.[173]\n\n\nBulbs offered for sale are referred to as either 'round' or 'double nose'. Round bulbs are circular in cross section and produce a single flower stem, while double nose bulbs have more than one bulb stem attached at the base and produce two or more flower stems, but bulbs with more than two stems are unusual.[175] Planted narcissi bulbs produce daughter bulbs in the axil of the bulb scales, leading to the dying off the exterior scales.[173] To prevent planted bulbs forming more and more small bulbs, they can be dug up every 5–7 years, and the daughters separated and replanted separately, provided that a piece of the basal plate, where the rootlets are formed, is preserved. For daffodils to flower at the end of the winter or early spring, bulbs are planted in autumn (September–November). This plant does well in ordinary soil but flourishes best in rich soil. Daffodils like the sun but also accept partial shade exposure.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nNarcissi are well suited for planting under small thickets of trees, where they can be grouped as 6–12 bulbs.[176] They also grow well in perennial borders,[173] especially in association with day lilies which begin to form their leaves as the narcissi flowers are fading.[174] A number of wild species and hybrids such as \"Dutch Master\", \"Golden Harvest\", \"Carlton\", \"Kings Court\" and \"Yellow Sun\" naturalise well in lawns,[173] but it is important not to mow the lawn till the leaves start to fade, since they are essential for nourishing the bulb for the next flowering season.[173] Blue Scilla and Muscari which also naturalise well in lawns and flower at the same time as narcissus, make an attractive contrast to the yellow flowers of the latter. Unlike tulips, narcissi bulbs are not attractive to rodents and are sometimes planted near tree roots in orchards to protect them.[177]\n\n\n\n### Propagation[edit]\n\n\nThe commonest form of commercial propagation is by twin-scaling, in which the bulbs are cut into many small pieces but with the two scales still connected by a small fragment of the basal plate. The fragments are disinfected and placed in nutrient media. Some 25–35 new plants can be produced from a single bulb after four years. Micropropagation methods are not used for commercial production but are used for establishing commercial stock.[178] [140]\n\n\n\n### Breeding[edit]\n\n\nFor commercial use, varieties with a minimum stem length of 30 centimetres (12 in) are sought, making them ideal for cut flowers. Florists require blooms that only open when they reach the retail outlet. For garden plants the objectives are to continually expand the colour palette and to produce hardy forms, and there is a particular demand for miniature varieties. The cultivars so produced tend to be larger and more robust than the wild types.[4] The main species used in breeding are *N. bulbocodium*, *N. cyclamineus*, *N. jonquilla*, *N. poeticus*, *N. pseudonarcissus*, *N. serotinus* and *N. tazetta*.[179]\n\n\n*Narcissus pseudonarcissus* gave rise to trumpet cultivars with coloured tepals and corona, while its subspecies *N. pseudonarcissus* subsp. *bicolor* was used for white tepaled varieties. To produce large cupped varieties, *N. pseudonarcissus* was crossed with *N. poeticus*, and to produce small cupped varieties back crossed with *N. poeticus*. Multiheaded varieties, often called \"Poetaz\" are mainly hybrids of *N. poeticus* and *N. tazetta*.[4]\n\n\n\n### Classification[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Range of *Narcissus* cultivars\nMain article: List of Narcissus horticultural divisions\n\nFor horticultural purposes, all *Narcissus* cultivars are split into 13 divisions as first described by Kington (1998),[180] for the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS),[6] based partly upon flower form (shape and length of corona), number of flowers per stem, flowering period and partly upon genetic background. Division 13, which includes wild daffodils, is the exception to this scheme.[181] The classification is a useful tool for planning planting. Most commercially available narcissi come from Divisions 1 (Trumpet), 2 (Large cupped) and 8 (Tazetta).\n\n\nGrowers register new daffodil cultivars by name and colour with the Royal Horticultural Society, which is the international registration authority for the genus.[64] Their *International Daffodil Register* is regularly updated with supplements available online[64] and is searchable.[19][65] The most recent supplement (2014) is the sixth (the fifth was published in 2012).[182] More than 27,000 names were registered as of 2008,[182] and the number has continued to grow. Registered daffodils are given a division number and colour code[183] such as 5 W-W (\"Thalia\").[184] In horticultural usage it is common to also find an unofficial Division 14: Miniatures, which although drawn from the other 13 divisions, have their miniature size in common.[185] Over 140 varieties have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit (See List of Award of Garden Merit narcissus).\n\n\n\n#### Colour code[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*Narcissus* \"Geranium\" **8 W-O**\nDaffodil breeding has introduced a wide range of colours, in both the outer perianth tepal segment and the inner corona. In the registry, daffodils are coded by the colours of each of these two parts. Thus \"Geranium\", Tazetta (Division 8) as illustrated here with a white outer perianth and orange corona is classified as **8 W-O**.\n\n\n\n## Toxicity[edit]\n\n\n### Pharmacology[edit]\n\n\nAll *Narcissus* species contain the alkaloid poison lycorine, mostly in the bulb but also in the leaves.[186] Members of the monocot subfamily Amaryllidoideae present a unique type of alkaloids, the norbelladine alkaloids, which are 4-methylcatechol derivatives combined with tyrosine. They are responsible for the poisonous properties of a number of the species. Over 200 different chemical structures of these compounds are known, of which 79 or more are known from *Narcissus* alone.[187]\n\n\nThe toxic effects of ingesting *Narcissus* products for both humans and animals (such as cattle, goats, pigs, and cats) have long been recognised and they have been used in suicide attempts. Ingestion of *N. pseudonarcissus* or *N. jonquilla* is followed by salivation, acute abdominal pains, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, then neurological and cardiac events, including trembling, convulsions, and paralysis. Death may result if large quantities are consumed.\n\n\nThe toxicity of *Narcissus* varies with species, *N. poeticus* being more toxic than *N. pseudonarcissus*, for instance. The distribution of toxins within the plant also varies, for instance, there is a five times higher concentration of alkaloid in the stem of *N. papyraceus* than in the bulb, making it dangerous to herbivores more likely to consume the stem than the bulb, and is part of the plant's defence mechanisms. The distribution of alkaloids within tissues may also reflect defence against parasites.[21] The bulbs can also be toxic to other nearby plants, including roses, rice, and cabbages, inhibiting growth.[21] For instance placing cut flowers in a vase alongside other flowers shortens the life of the latter.[188]\n\n\n\n### Poisoning[edit]\n\n\nMany cases of poisoning or death have occurred when narcissi bulbs have been mistaken for leeks or onions and cooked and eaten. Recovery is usually complete in a few hours without any specific intervention. In more severe cases involving ingestion of large quantities of bulbs, activated carbon, salts and laxatives may be required, and for severe symptoms intravenous atropine and emetics or stomach pumping may be indicated. However, ingestion of large quantities accidentally is unusual because of a strong unpleasant taste. When narcissi were compared with a number of other plants not normally consumed by animals, narcissi were the most repellent, specifically *N. pseudonarcissus*. Consequently, narcissus alkaloids have been used as repellents and may also discourage fungi, molds, and bacteria.[21]\n\n\nOn 1 May 2009, a number of schoolchildren fell ill at Gorseland Primary School in Martlesham Heath, Suffolk, England, after a daffodil bulb was added to soup during a cookery class.[186]\n\n\n\n### Topical effects[edit]\n\n\nOne of the most common dermatitis problems for flower pickers, packers, florists, and gardeners, \"daffodil itch\", involves dryness, fissures, scaling, and erythema in the hands, often accompanied by subungual hyperkeratosis (thickening of the skin beneath the nails). It is blamed on exposure to calcium oxalate, chelidonic acid or alkaloids such as lycorine in the sap, either due to a direct irritant effect or an allergic reaction.[189][190] It has long been recognised that some cultivars provoke dermatitis more readily than others. *N. pseudonarcissus* and the cultivars \"Actaea\", \"Camparelle\", \"Gloriosa\", \"Grande Monarque\", \"Ornatus\", \"Princeps\" and \"Scilly White\" are known to do so.[21][191]\n\n\nIf bulb extracts come into contact with wounds, both central nervous system and cardiac symptoms may result. The scent can also cause toxic reactions such as headaches and vomiting from *N. bulbocodium*.[21]\n\n\n\n## Uses[edit]\n\n\n### Traditional medicine[edit]\n\n\nDespite the lethal potential of *Narcissus* alkaloids, they have been used for centuries as traditional medicines for a variety of complaints, including cancer. Plants thought to be *N. poeticus* and *N. tazetta* are described in the Bible in the treatment for what is thought to be cancer.[188][192][193][194] In the Classical Greek world Hippocrates (ca. B.C. 460–370) recommended a pessary prepared from narcissus oil for uterine tumors, a practice continued by Pedanius Dioscorides (ca. A.D. 40–90) and Soranus of Ephesus (A.D. 98–138) in the first and second centuries A.D., while the Roman Pliny the Elder (A.D. 23–79), advocated topical use.[188] The bulbs of *N. poeticus* contain the antineoplastic agent narciclasine. This usage is also found in later Arabian, North African, Central American and Chinese medicine during the Middle Ages.[188] In China N. tazetta var. chinensis was grown as an ornamental plant but the bulbs were applied topically to tumors in traditional folk medicine. These bulbs contain pretazettine, an active antitumor compound.[21][194][195]\n\n\n*Narcissus* products have received a variety of other uses. The Roman physician Aulus Cornelius Celsus listed narcissus root in *De Medicina* among medical herbs, described as emollient, erodent, and \"powerful to disperse whatever has collected in any part of the body\". N. tazetta bulbs were used in Turkey as a remedy for abscesses in the belief they were antiphlogistic and analgesic. Other uses include the application to wounds, strains, painful joints, and various local ailments as an ointment called 'Narcissimum'. Powdered flowers have also been used medically, as an emetic, a decongestant and for the relief of dysentery, in the form of a syrup or infusion. The French used the flowers as an antispasmodic, the Arabs the oil for baldness and also an aphrodisiac. In the eighteenth century the Irish herbal of John K'Eogh recommended pounding the roots in honey for use on burns, bruises, dislocations and freckles, and for drawing out thorns and splinters. *N. tazetta* bulbs have also been used for contraception, while the flowers have been recommended for hysteria and epilepsy.[21] In the traditional Japanese medicine of kampo, wounds were treated with narcissus root and wheat flour paste;[196] the plant, however, does not appear in the modern kampo herb list.\n\n\nThere is also a long history of the use of *Narcissus* as a stimulant and to induce trance like states and hallucinations. Sophocles referred to the narcissus as the \"Chaplet of the infernal Gods\",[72] a statement frequently wrongly attributed to Socrates (see Antiquity).[21]\n\n\n\n### Biological properties[edit]\n\n\nExtracts of *Narcissus* have demonstrated a number of potentially useful biological properties including antiviral, prophage induction, antibacterial, antifungal, antimalarial, insecticidal, cytotoxic, antitumor, antimitotic, antiplatelet, hypotensive, emetic, acetylcholine esterase inhibitory, antifertility, antinociceptive, chronotropic, pheromone, plant growth inhibitor, and allelopathic.[21] An ethanol extract of *Narcissus* bulbs was found effective in one mouse model of nociception, para-benzoquinone induced abdominal constriction, but not in another, the hot plate test.[197] Most of these properties are due to alkaloids, but some are also due to mannose-binding lectins. The most-studied alkaloids in this group are galantamine (galanthamine),[198] lycorine, narciclasine, and pretazettine.\n\n\nIt is likely that the traditional use of narcissi for the treatment of cancer was due to the presence of isocarbostyril constituents such as narciclasine, pancratistatin and their congeners. *N. poeticus* contains about 0.12g of narciclasine per kg of fresh bulbs.[188]\n\n\nAcetylcholine esterase inhibition has attracted the most interest as a possible therapeutic intervention, with activity varying by a thousandfold between species, and the greatest activity seen in those that contain galantamine or epinorgalanthamine.[59]\n\n\nThe rodent repellant properties of *Narcissus* alkaloids have been utilised in horticulture to protect more vulnerable bulbs.[199]\n\n\n\n### Therapeutics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Daffodils growing in Wales\nOf all the alkaloids, only galantamine has made it to therapeutic use in humans, as the drug galantamine for Alzheimer's disease. Galantamine is an acetylcholine esterase inhibitor which crosses the blood brain barrier and is active within the central nervous system.[21] Daffodils are grown commercially near Brecon in Powys, Wales, to produce galantamine.[200]\n\n\n\n### Commercial uses[edit]\n\n\nThroughout history the scent of narcissi has been an important ingredient of perfumes, a quality that comes from essential oils rather than alkaloids.[21] Narcissi are also an important horticultural crop,[50][75] and source of cut flowers (floriculture).\n\n\n\n![](image)Daffodil production in the Netherlands\nThe Netherlands, which is the most important source of flower bulbs worldwide is also a major centre of narcissus production. Of 16,700 hectares (ha) under cultivation for flower bulbs, narcissi account for about 1,800 hectares. In the 1990s narcissus bulb production was at 260 million, sixth in size after tulips, gladioli, irises, crocuses and lilies and in 2012 it was ranked third.[148] About two-thirds of the area under cultivation is dedicated to about 20 of the most popular varieties. In the 2009/2010 season, 470 cultivars were produced on 1578 ha. By far the largest area cultivated is for the miniature 'Tête-à-Tête', followed at some distance by 'Carlton'. The largest production cultivars are shown in Table II.[201]\n\n\n\n\n\n Table II: Area under cultivation in the Netherlands, by cultivar\n| Cultivar | Division | Colour | Area (ha)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \"Tête-à-Tête\" | 6: Cyclamineus | Yellow | 663\n |\n| \"Carlton\" | 2: Large cup | Yellow | 54\n |\n| \"Bridal Crown\" | 4: Double | White–Yellow | 51\n |\n| \"Dutch Master\" | 1: Trumpet | Yellow | 47\n |\n| \"Jetfire\" | 6: Cyclamineus | Yellow–Orange | 42\n |\n| \"Ice Follies\" | 2: Large cup | White | 36\n |\n\n\n\"Carlton\" and \"Ice Follies\" (Division 2: Large cup) have a long history of cultivation, together with \"Dutch Master\" and \"Golden Harvest\" (1: yellow). \"Carlton\" and \"Golden Harvest\" were introduced in 1927, and \"Ice Follies\" in 1953. \"Carlton\", with over 9 billion bulbs (350 000 tons), is among the more numerous individual plants produced in the world.[202] The other major areas of production are the United States,[148] Israel which exported 25 million *N. tazetta* cultivar bulbs in 2003,[201] and the United Kingdom.\n\n\nIn the United Kingdom a total of 4100 ha were planted with bulbs, of which 3800 ha were Narcissi, the UK's most important bulb crop, much of which is for export,[203] making this the largest global production centre, about half of the total production area. While some of the production is for forcing, most is for dry bulb production. Bulb production and forcing occurs in the East, while production in the south west is mainly for outdoor flower production.[204] The farm gate value was estimated at £10m in 2007.[205]\n\n\n\n![](image)Narcissi growing at Keukenhof\nProduction of both bulbs and cut flowers takes place in open fields in beds or ridges, often in the same field, allowing adaptation to changing market conditions. Narcissi grow best in mild maritime climates. Compared to the United Kingdom, the harsher winters in the Netherlands require covering the fields with straw for protection. Areas with higher rainfall and temperatures are more susceptible to diseases that attack crops. Production is based on a 1 (UK) or 2 (Netherlands) year cycle. Optimal soil pH is 6.0–7.5. Prior to planting disinfection by hot water takes place, such as immersion at 44.4 °C for three hours.[140]\n\n\nBulbs are harvested for market in the summer, sorted, stored for 2–3 weeks, and then further disinfected by a hot (43.5 °C) bath. This eliminates infestations by narcissus fly and nematodes. The bulbs are then dried at a high temperature, and then stored at 15.5 °C.[4] The initiation of new flower development in the bulb takes place in late spring before the bulbs are lifted, and is completed by mid summer while the bulbs are in storage. The optimal temperature for initiation is 20 °C followed by cooling to 13 °C.[5]\n\n\nTraditionally, sales took place in the daffodil fields prior to harvesting the bulbs, but today sales are handled by Marketing Boards although still before harvesting. In the Netherlands there are special exhibition gardens for major buyers to view flowers and order bulbs, some larger ones may have more than a thousand narcissus varieties on display. While individuals can visit these gardens they cannot buy bulbs at retail, which are only available at wholesale, usually at a minimum of several hundredweight. The most famous display is at Keukenhof, although only about 100 narcissus varieties are on display there.\n\n\n\n#### Forcing[edit]\n\n\nThere is also a market for forced blooms, both as cut flowers and potted flowers through the winter from Christmas to Easter, the long season requiring special preparation by growers.\n\n\n\n##### Cut flowers[edit]\n\n\nFor cut flowers, bulbs larger than 12 cm in size are preferred. To bloom in December, bulbs are harvested in June to July, dried, stored for four days at 34 °C, two weeks at 30 and two weeks at 17–20 °C and then placed in cold storage for precooling at 9 degrees for about 15–16 weeks. The bulbs are then planted in light compost in crates in a greenhouse for forcing at 13 °C–15 °C and the blooms appear in 19–30 days.[4][140]\n\n\n\n##### Potted flowers[edit]\n\n\nFor potted flowers a lower temperature is used for precooling (5 °C for 15 weeks), followed by 16 °C–18 °C in a greenhouse. For later blooming (mid- and late-forcing), bulbs are harvested in July to August and the higher temperatures are omitted, being stored a 17–20 °C after harvesting and placed in cold storage at 9 °C in September for 17–18 (cut flowers) or 14–16 (potted flowers) weeks. The bulbs can then be planted in cold frames, and then forced in a greenhouse according to requirements.[140] *N. tazetta* and its cultivars are an exception to this rule, requiring no cold period. Often harvested in October, bulbs are lifted in May and dried and heated to 30 °C for three weeks, then stored at 25 °C for 12 weeks and planted. Flowering can be delayed by storing at 5 °C–10 °C.[111]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Narcissus in culture\n\n### Symbols[edit]\n\n\n![](image)N. triandrus 'Thalia', considered a grave flower\nThe daffodil is the national flower of Wales, associated with Saint David's Day (March 1). The narcissus is also a national flower symbolising the new year or *Nowruz* in the Iranian culture.\n\n\nIn the West the narcissus is perceived as a symbol of vanity, in the East as a symbol of wealth and good fortune (see § Eastern cultures, below), while in Persian literature, the narcissus is a symbol of beautiful eyes.\n\n\nIn western countries the daffodil is also associated with spring festivals such as Lent and its successor Easter. In Germany the wild narcissus, *N. pseudonarcissus*, is known as the *Osterglocke* or \"Easter bell.\" In the United Kingdom the daffodil is sometimes referred to as the Lenten lily.[91][92][Note 4]\n\n\nAlthough prized as an ornamental flower, some people consider narcissi unlucky, because they hang their heads implying misfortune.[21] White narcissi, such as *N triandrus* \"Thalia\", are especially associated with death, and have been called grave flowers.[206][207] In Ancient Greece narcissi were planted near tombs, and Robert Herrick describes them as portents of death, an association which also appears in the myth of Persephone and the underworld (see § Art, below).\n\n\n\n### Art[edit]\n\n\n#### Antiquity[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Demeter and Persephone surrounded by daffodils - \"*Demeter rejoiced, for her daughter was by her side*\"\nThe decorative use of narcissi dates as far back as ancient Egyptian tombs, and frescoes at Pompeii.[208] They are mentioned in the King James Version of the Bible[209] as the Rose of Sharon[75][210][211][212] and make frequent appearances in classical literature.[164]\n\n\n\n#### Greek culture[edit]\n\n\nThe narcissus appears in two Graeco-Roman myths, that of the youth Narcissus who was turned into the flower of that name, and of the Goddess Persephone snatched into the Underworld by the god Hades while picking the flowers. The narcissus is considered sacred to both Hades and Persephone,[213] and grows along the banks of the river Styx in the underworld.[207]\n\n\nThe Greek poet Stasinos mentioned them in the *Cypria* amongst the flowers of Cyprus.[214] The legend of Persephone comes to us mainly in the seventh century BC Homeric Hymn *To Demeter*,[215] where the author describes the narcissus, and its role as a lure to trap the young Persephone. The flower, she recounts to her mother was the last flower she reached for before being seized.\n\n\nOther Greek authors making reference to the narcissus include Sophocles and Plutarch. Sophocles, in *Oedipus at Colonus* utilises narcissus in a symbolic manner, implying fertility,[216] allying it with the cults of Demeter and her daughter Kore (Persephone),[217] and by extension, a symbol of death.[218] Jebb comments that it is *the flower of imminent death* with its fragrance being narcotic, emphasised by its pale white colour. Just as Persephone reaching for the flower heralded her doom, the youth Narcissus gazing at his own reflection portended his own death.[217] Plutarch refers to this in his *Symposiacs* as numbing the nerves causing a heaviness in the limbs.[219] He refers to Sophocles' \"crown of the great Goddesses\", which is the source of the English phrase \"Chaplet of the infernal Gods\" incorrectly attributed to Socrates.[72]\n\n\nA passage by Moschus, describes fragrant narcissi.[220][221][222] Homer in his *Odyssey*[223][224][225][226] described the underworld as having Elysian meadows carpeted with flowers, thought to be narcissus, as described by Theophrastus.[75][227][Note 5] A similar account is provided by Lucian describing the flowers in the underworld.[228][229][230] The myth of the youth Narcissus is also taken up by Pausanias. He believed that the myth of Persephone long antedated that of Narcissus, and hence discounted the idea the flower was named after the youth.[78]\n\n\n\n#### Roman culture[edit]\n\n\nVirgil, the first known Roman writer to refer to the narcissus, does so in several places, for instance twice in the *Georgics*.[231] Virgil refers to the cup shaped corona of the narcissus flower, allegedly containing the tears of the self-loving youth Narcissus.[232] Milton makes a similar analogy \"*And Daffodillies fill their Cups with Tears*\".[233] Virgil also mentions narcissi three times in the *Eclogues*.[234][235]\n\n\nThe poet Ovid also dealt with the mythology of the narcissus. In his *Metamorphoses*, he recounts the story of the youth Narcissus who, after his death, is turned into the flower,[236][237] and it is also mentioned in Book 5 of his poem *Fasti*.[238][239] This theme of metamorphosis was broader than just *Narcissus*; for instance see crocus, laurel and hyacinth.[240]\n\n\n\n#### Western culture[edit]\n\n\n*I wandered lonely as a Cloud*\n\n\n> \n> ![I](image) wandered lonely as a Cloud  \n> \n> That floats on high o'er Vales and Hills,  \n> \n> When all at once I saw a crowd  \n> \n> A host of dancing Daffodils;  \n> \n> Along the Lake, beneath the trees,  \n> \n> Ten thousand dancing in the breeze.  \n> \n>   \n> \n> The waves beside them danced, but they  \n> \n> Outdid the sparkling waves in glee: –  \n> \n> A poet could not but be gay  \n> \n> In such a laughing company:  \n> \n> I gaz'd – and gaz'd – but little thought  \n> \n> What wealth the shew to me had brought:  \n> \n>   \n> \n> For oft when on my couch I lie  \n> \n> In vacant or in pensive mood,  \n> \n> They flash upon that inward eye  \n> \n> Which is the bliss of solitude,  \n> \n> And then my heart with pleasure fills,  \n> \n> And dances with the Daffodils.\n> \n> \n\n\nWilliam Wordsworth (1804 version)[241] \n\n![](image)\n\nAlthough there is no clear evidence that the flower's name derives directly from the Greek myth, this link between the flower and the myth became firmly part of western culture. The narcissus or daffodil is the most loved of all English plants,[154] and appears frequently in English literature. Many English writers have referred to the cultural and symbolic importance of *Narcissus*[242][243][244][245]). No flower has received more poetic description except the rose and the lily, with poems by authors from John Gower, Shakespeare, Milton (see Roman culture, above), Wordsworth, Shelley and Keats. Frequently the poems deal with self-love derived from Ovid's account.[246][247] Gower's reference to the yellow flower of the legend has been assumed to be the daffodil or *Narcissus*,[248] though as with all references in the older literature to the flower that sprang from the youth's death, there is room for some debate as to the exact species of flower indicated, some preferring *Crocus*.[249] Spenser announces the coming of the Daffodil in *Aprill* of his *Shepheardes Calender* (1579).[250]\n\n\nShakespeare, who frequently uses flower imagery,[245] refers to daffodils twice in *The Winter's Tale* [251] and also *The Two Noble Kinsmen*. Robert Herrick alludes to their association with death in a number of poems.[252][253] Among the English romantic movement writers none is better known than William Wordsworth's short 1804 poem *I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud*[241] which has become linked in the popular mind with the daffodils that form its main image.[75][207][246][254] Wordsworth also included the daffodil in other poems.[255] Yet the description given of daffodils by his sister, Dorothy is just as poetic, if not more so,[170] just that her poetry was prose and appears almost an unconscious imitation of the first section of the Homeric *Hymn to Demeter* (see Greek culture, above).[256][170][257] Among their contemporaries, Keats refers to daffodils among those things capable of bringing \"joy for ever\".[258]\n\n\nMore recently A. E. Housman, using one of the daffodil's more symbolic names (see Symbols), wrote *The Lent Lily* in *A Shropshire Lad*, describing the traditional Easter death of the daffodil.[259]\n\n\nIn *Black Narcissus*, Rumer Godden describes the disorientation of English nuns in the Indian Himalayas, and gives the plant name an unexpected twist, alluding both to narcissism and the effect of the perfume *Narcisse Noir* (Caron) on others. The novel was later adapted into the 1947 British film of the same name. The narcissus also appears in German literature such as that of Paul Gerhardt.[260]\n\n\nIn the visual arts, narcissi are depicted in three different contexts, mythological (Narcissus, Persephone), floral art, or landscapes. The Narcissus story has been popular with painters and the youth is frequently depicted with flowers to indicate this association.[74][240] The Persephone theme is also typified by Waterhouse in his *Narcissus*, the floral motif by van Scorel and the landscape by Van Gogh's *Undergrowth*.\n\n\nNarcissi first started to appear in western art in the late Middle Ages, in panel paintings, particularly those depicting crucifixion. For instance that of the Westfälischer Meister in Köln in the Wallraf-Richartz-Museum, Cologne,[261] where daffodils symbolise not only death but also hope in the resurrection, because they are perennial and bloom at Easter.[207][262][263]\n\n\n\n**Narcissi in art**\n\n* ![Jan van Scorel: Madonna of the Daffodils with the Child and Donors, 1535](image)\n\nJan van Scorel: *Madonna of the Daffodils with the Child and Donors*, 1535\n* ![Vincent van Gogh: Undergrowth with Two Figures, 1890](image)\n\nVincent van Gogh: *Undergrowth with Two Figures*, 1890\n* ![Waterhouse: Narcissus, 1912](image)\n\nWaterhouse: *Narcissus*, 1912\n* ![Crucifixion, Westfälischer Meister c. 1415](image)\n\nCrucifixion, Westfälischer Meister c. 1415\n\n\n#### Eastern cultures[edit]\n\n\nIn Chinese culture *Narcissus tazetta* subsp. *chinensis* (Chinese sacred lilies), which can be grown indoors, is widely used as an ornamental plant.[264][265] It was probably introduced to China by Arab traders travelling the Silk Road prior to the Song dynasty for medicinal use.[50][264][265] Spring-flowering, they became associated with Chinese New Year, signifying good fortune, prosperity and good luck[266] and there are many legends in Chinese culture associated with *Narcissus*.[267][268][269] In contrast to the West, narcissi have not played a significant part in Chinese Garden art,[270] however, Zhao Mengjian in the Southern Song dynasty was noted for his portrayal of narcissi.[271][272] Narcissus bulb carving and cultivation has become an art akin to Japanese bonsai. The Japanese novel *Narcissu* contains many references to the narcissus, where the main characters set out for the famed narcissus fields on Awaji Island.[273][274]\n\n\n\n#### Islamic culture[edit]\n\n\nNarcissi are one of the most popular garden plants in Islamic culture.[275] Prior to the Arab conquest of Persia, the Persian ruler Khosrau I (r. 531–579) is said to have not been able to tolerate them at feasts because they reminded him of eyes, an association that persists to this day.[276] The Persian phrase نرگس شهلا (*narges-e šahlâ*, literally \"a reddish-blue narcissus\")[277] is a well-known metonymy for the \"eye(s) of a mistress\"[277] in the classical poetries of the Persian, Urdu,[278] Ottoman Turkish, Azerbaijani and Chagatai languages; to this day also the vernacular names of some narcissus cultivars (for example, *Shahla-ye Shiraz* and *Shahla-ye Kazerun*).[279] As described by the poet Ghalib (1797–1869), \"God has given the eye of the narcissus the power of seeing\".[276] The eye imagery is also found in a number of poems by Abu Nuwas.[280][281][282][283] Another poet who refers to narcissi, is Rumi. Even the prophet Mohammed is said to have praised the narcissus,[284] though some of the sayings that were cited as proof are considered \"weak\" records.[285]\n\n\n\n**Narcissi in Eastern and Islamic cultures**\n\n* ![Chinese Sacred Lily](image)\n\nChinese Sacred Lily\n* ![Chinese decorative carved Narcissus bulb](image)\n\nChinese decorative carved *Narcissus* bulb\n* ![N. poeticus symbolising the eye in Islamic culture](image)\n\n*N. poeticus* symbolising the eye in Islamic culture\n\n\n### Popular culture[edit]\n\n\nThe word \"daffodil\" has been used widely in popular culture, from Dutch cars (DAF Daffodil) to Swedish rock bands (The Daffodils) to slurs against homosexuals and cross-dressers (as in the film *J. Edgar*, when Hoover's mother explains why real-life cross-dresser Barton Pinkus[286] was called \"Daffy\" (short for \"Daffodil\" and the equivalent of a pansy[287]), and admonishes, \"I'd rather have a dead son than a daffodil for a son\".[288][289][290][291][292]\n\n\n\n### Festivals[edit]\n\n\nIn some areas where narcissi are prevalent, their blooming in spring is celebrated in festivals. For instance, the slopes around Montreux, Switzerland and its associated riviera come alive with blooms each May (*May Snow*) at the annual Narcissi Festival.[293] Festivals are also held in many other countries.\n\n\n\n### Cancer[edit]\n\n\nVarious cancer charities around the world, such as the American Cancer Society,[294] Cancer Society,[295] Cancer Council,[296] Irish Cancer Society,[297] and Marie Curie in the UK[298] use the daffodil as a fundraising symbol on \"Daffodil Days\".[299]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of Narcissus species\n* List of Narcissus horticultural divisions\n* List of AGM narcissus – Narcissus cultivars given the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit\n* Narcissus in culture\n* Orange trumpet\n* Taxonomy of Narcissus\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The word \"daffodil\" is also applied to related genera such as *Sternbergia*, *Ismene* and *Fritillaria meleagris*. It has been suggested that the word \"Daffodil\" be restricted to the wild species of the British Isles, *N. pseudonarcissus*. (Halevy 1985, Rees A. R.

Various common names including **daffodil**,[Note 1] **narcissus** and **jonquil**, are used to describe all or some members of the genus. *Narcissus* has conspicuous flowers with six petal-like tepals surmounted by a cup- or trumpet-shaped corona. The flowers are generally white and yellow (also orange or pink in garden varieties), with either uniform or contrasting coloured tepals and corona.\n\n\n*Narcissus* were well known in ancient civilisation, both medicinally and botanically, but were formally described by Linnaeus in his *Species Plantarum* (1753). The genus is generally considered to have about ten sections with approximately 36 species. The number of species has varied, depending on how they are classified, due to similarity between species and hybridisation. The genus arose some time in the Late Oligocene to Early Miocene epochs, in the Iberian peninsula and adjacent areas of southwest Europe. The exact origin of the name *Narcissus* is unknown, but it is often linked to a Greek word (ancient Greek ναρκῶ narkō, \"to make numb\") and the myth of the youth of that name who fell in love with his own reflection. The English word \"daffodil\" appears to be derived from \"asphodel\", with which it was commonly compared.\n\n\nThe species are native to meadows and woods in southern Europe and North Africa with a centre of diversity in the Western Mediterranean, particularly the Iberian peninsula. Both wild and cultivated plants have naturalised widely, and were introduced into the Far East prior to the tenth century. Narcissi tend to be long-lived bulbs, which propagate by division, but are also insect-pollinated. Known pests, diseases and disorders include viruses, fungi, the larvae of flies, mites and nematodes. Some *Narcissus* species have become extinct, while others are threatened by increasing urbanisation and tourism.\n\n\nHistorical accounts suggest narcissi have been cultivated from the earliest times, but became increasingly popular in Europe after the 16th century and by the late 19th century were an important commercial crop centred primarily in the Netherlands. Today narcissi are popular as cut flowers and as ornamental plants in private and public gardens. The long history of breeding has resulted in thousands of different cultivars. For horticultural purposes, narcissi are classified into divisions, covering a wide range of shapes and colours. Like other members of their family, narcissi produce a number of different alkaloids, which provide some protection for the plant, but may be poisonous if accidentally ingested. This property has been exploited for medicinal use in traditional healing and has resulted in the production of galantamine for the treatment of Alzheimer's dementia. Long celebrated in art and literature, narcissi are associated with a number of themes in different cultures, ranging from death to good fortune, and as symbols of spring.\n\n\nThe daffodil is the national flower of Wales and the symbol of cancer charities in many countries. The appearance of wild flowers in spring is associated with festivals in many places.\n\n\n\n\n## Description[edit]\n\n\nVegetative\n![](image)\n*Narcissus* **bulb** with shoot and roots\n![](image)\n*Narcissus* **shoots** emerging, with sheathed leaves\n\n*Narcissus* floral morphology\n![](image)\nSolitary *Narcissus* flower, prior to opening, emerging from **spathe**\n![](image)\n*N. papyraceus*, showing **umbel formation**\n![](image)\n*N. pseudonarcissus* showing from top to bottom, **spathe**, **floral tube**, **tepals**, **corona**\n![](image)\n*N. cyclamineus*, showing reflexed tepals\n![](image)\n*N. bulbocodium* showing prominent **corona** and reduced tepals\n![](image)\n*N. triandrus*, showing **pendent orientation** and reflexed tepals\n![](image)\nNarcissus flower, showing erect orientation\n![](image)\n*Narcissus* flower, showing outer white **tepals** with a central yellow corona (paraperigonium)\n![](image)\nTazetta cultivar, showing **stamens** surrounding central stigma\n![](image)\nClose-up of stamen filaments and anthers, with stigma\n\nGynoecium and fruit\n![](image)\nLongitudinal section of **ovary** with ovules\n![](image)\nCross section of ovary\n![](image)\n*Narcissus* capsule dispersing **seed**\n\n### General[edit]\n\n\n*Narcissus* is a genus of perennial herbaceous bulbiferous geophytes, which die back after flowering to an underground storage bulb. They regrow in the following year from brown-skinned ovoid bulbs with pronounced necks, and reach heights of 5–80 centimetres (2.0–31.5 in) depending on the species. Dwarf species such as *N. asturiensis* have a maximum height of 5–8 centimetres (2.0–3.1 in), while *Narcissus tazetta* may grow as tall as 80 centimetres (31 in).[3][4]\n\n\nThe plants are scapose, having a single central leafless hollow flower stem (scape). Several green or blue-green, narrow, strap-shaped leaves arise from the bulb. The plant stem usually bears a solitary flower, but occasionally a cluster of flowers (umbel). The flowers, which are usually conspicuous and white or yellow, sometimes both or rarely green, consist of a perianth of three parts. Closest to the stem (proximal) is a floral tube above the ovary, then an outer ring composed of six tepals (undifferentiated sepals and petals), and a central disc to conical shaped corona. The flowers may hang down (pendant), or be erect. There are six pollen bearing stamens surrounding a central style. The ovary is inferior (below the floral parts) consisting of three chambers (trilocular). The fruit consists of a dry capsule that splits (dehisces) releasing numerous black seeds.[4]\n\n\nThe bulb lies dormant after the leaves and flower stem die back and has contractile roots that pull it down further into the soil. The flower stem and leaves form in the bulb, to emerge the following season. Most species are dormant from summer to late winter, flowering in the spring, though a few species are autumn flowering.[4]\n\n\n\n### Specific[edit]\n\n\n#### Vegetative[edit]\n\n\nBulbs\n\nThe pale brown-skinned ovoid tunicate **bulbs** have a membranous tunic and a corky stem (base or basal) plate from which arise the adventitious root hairs in a ring around the edge, which grow up to 40 mm in length. Above the stem plate is the storage organ consisting of bulb scales, surrounding the previous flower stalk and the terminal bud. The scales are of two types, true storage organs and the bases of the foliage leaves. These have a thicker tip and a scar from where the leaf lamina became detached. The innermost leaf scale is semicircular only partly enveloping the flower stalk (semisheathed).(see Hanks Fig 1.3). The bulb may contain a number of branched bulb units, each with two to three true scales and two to three leaf bases. Each bulb unit has a life of about four years.[4][5]\n\n\nOnce the leaves die back in summer, the roots also wither. After some years, the roots shorten pulling the bulbs deeper into the ground (contractile roots). The bulbs develop from the inside, pushing the older layers outwards which become brown and dry, forming an outer shell, the tunic or skin. Up to 60 layers have been counted in some wild species. While the plant appears dormant above the ground the flower stalk which will start to grow in the following spring, develops within the bulb surrounded by two to three deciduous leaves and their sheaths. The flower stem lies in the axil of the second true leaf.[4]\n\n\n\nStems\n\nThe single leafless **Plant stem stem** or scape, appearing from early to late spring depending on the species, bears from 1 to 20 blooms.[6] Stem shape depends on the species, some are highly compressed with a visible seam, while others are rounded. The stems are upright and located at the centre of the leaves. In a few species such as *N. hedraeanthus* the stem is oblique. The stem is hollow in the upper portion but towards the bulb is more solid and filled with a spongy material.[7]\n\n\n\nLeaves\n\n*Narcissus* plants have one to several basal **leaf leaves** which are linear, ligulate or strap-shaped (long and narrow), sometimes channelled adaxially to semiterete, and may (pedicellate) or may not (sessile) have a petiole stalk.[8] The leaves are flat and broad to cylindrical at the base and arise from the bulb.[9] The emerging plant generally has two leaves, but the mature plant usually three, rarely four, and they are covered with a cutin containing cuticle, giving them a waxy appearance. Leaf colour is light green to blue-green. In the mature plant, the leaves extend higher than the flower stem, but in some species, the leaves are low-hanging. The leaf base is encased in a colorless sheath. After flowering, the leaves turn yellow and die back once the seed pod (fruit) is ripe.[4]\n\n\nJonquils usually have dark green, round, rush-like leaves.[10]\n\n\n\n#### Reproductive[edit]\n\n\nInflorescence\n\nThe **inflorescence** is scapose, the single stem or scape bearing either a solitary flower or forming an umbel with up to 20 blooms.[6] Species bearing a solitary flower include section *Bulbocodium* and most of section *Pseudonarcissus*. Umbellate species have a fleshy racemose inflorescence (unbranched, with short floral stalks) with 2 to 15 or 20 flowers, such as *N. papyraceus* (see illustration, left) and *N. tazetta* (see Table I).[11][12] The flower arrangement on the inflorescence may be either with (pedicellate) or without (sessile) floral stalks.\n\n\nPrior to opening, the flower buds are enveloped and protected in a thin dry papery or membranous (scarious) spathe. The spathe consists of a singular bract that is ribbed, and which remains wrapped around the base of the open flower. As the bud grows, the spathe splits longitudinally.[13][14] Bracteoles are small or absent.[7][13][12][15]\n\n\n\nFlowers\n\nThe **flowers** of *Narcissus* are hermaphroditic (bisexual),[16] have three parts (tripartite), and are sometimes fragrant (see Fragrances).[17] The flower symmetry is actinomorphic (radial) to slightly zygomorphic (bilateral) due to declinate-ascending stamens (curving downwards, then bent up at the tip). *Narcissus* flowers are characterised by their, usually conspicuous, corona (trumpet).\n\n\nThe three major floral parts (in all species except *N. cavanillesii* in which the corona is virtually absent - Table I: Section *Tapeinanthus*) are;\n\n\n\n* (i) the proximal floral tube (hypanthium),\n* (ii) the surrounding free tepals, and\n* (iii) the more distal corona (paraperigon, paraperigonium).\n\n\nAll three parts may be considered to be components of the perianth (perigon, perigonium). The perianth arises above the apex of the inferior ovary, its base forming the hypanthial floral tube.\n\n\nThe floral tube is formed by fusion of the basal segments of the tepals (proximally connate). Its shape is from an inverted cone (obconic) to funnel-shaped (funneliform) or cylindrical, and is surmounted by the more distal corona. Floral tubes can range from long and narrow sections *Apodanthi* and *Jonquilla* to rudimentary (*N. cavanillesii*).[18]\n\n\nSurrounding the floral tube and corona and reflexed (bent back) from the rest of the perianth are the six spreading tepals or floral leaves, in two whorls which may be distally ascending, reflexed (folded back), or lanceolate. Like many monocotyledons, the perianth is homochlamydeous, which is undifferentiated into separate calyx (sepals) and corolla (petals), but rather has six tepals. The three outer tepal segments may be considered sepals, and the three inner segments petals. The transition point between the floral tube and the corona is marked by the insertion of the free tepals on the fused perianth.[5]\n\n\nThe corona, or paracorolla, is variously described as bell-shaped (funneliform, trumpet), bowl-shaped (cupular, crateriform, cup-shaped) or disc-shaped with margins that are often frilled, and is free from the stamens. Rarely is the corona a simple callose (hardened, thickened) ring. The corona is formed during floral development as a tubular outgrowth from stamens which fuse into a tubular structure, the anthers becoming reduced. At its base, the fragrances which attract pollinators are formed. All species produce nectar at the top of the ovary.[11] Coronal morphology varies from the tiny pigmented disk of *N. serotinus* (see Table I) or the rudimentary structure in *N. cavanillesii* to the elongated trumpets of section *Pseudonarcissus* (trumpet daffodils, Table I).[8][11][12][5]\n\n\nWhile the perianth may point forwards, in some species such as *N. cyclamineus* it is folded back (reflexed, see illustration, left), while in some other species such as *N. bulbocodium* (Table I), it is reduced to a few barely visible pointed segments with a prominent corona.\n\n\nThe colour of the perianth is white, yellow or bicoloured, with the exception of the night flowering *N. viridiflorus* which is green. In addition the corona of *N. poeticus* has a red crenulate margin (see Table I).[9] Flower diameter varies from 12 mm (*N. bulbocodium*) to over 125 mm (*N. nobilis*=*N. pseudonarcissus* subsp. *nobilis*).[18]\n\n\nFlower orientation varies from pendent or deflexed (hanging down) as in *N. triandrus* (see illustration, left), through declinate-ascendant as in *N. alpestris* = *N. pseudonarcissus* subsp. *moschatus*, horizontal (patent, spreading) such as *N. gaditanus* or *N. poeticus*, erect as in *N. cavanillesii*, *N. serotinus* and *N. rupicola* (Table I), or intermediate between these positions (erecto-patent).[7][9][11][12][15][19][18]\n\n\nThe flowers of *Narcissus* demonstrate exceptional floral diversity and sexual polymorphism,[15] primarily by corona size and floral tube length, associated with pollinator groups (see for instance Figs. 1 and 2 in Graham and Barrett[11]). Barrett and Harder (2005) describe three separate floral patterns;\n\n\n\n* \"Daffodil\" form\n* \"Paperwhite\" form\n* \"Triandrus\" form.\n\n\nThe predominant patterns are the 'daffodil' and 'paperwhite' forms, while the \"triandrus\" form is less common. Each corresponds to a different group of pollinators (See Pollination).[15]\n\n\nThe \"daffodil\" form, which includes sections *Pseudonarcissus* and *Bulbocodium*, has a relatively short, broad or highly funnelform tube (funnel-like), which grades into an elongated corona, which is large and funnelform, forming a broad, cylindrical or trumpet-shaped perianth. Section *Pseudonarcissus* consists of relatively large flowers with a corolla length of around 50 mm, generally solitary but rarely in inflorescences of 2–4 flowers. They have wide greenish floral tubes with funnel-shaped bright yellow coronas. The six tepals sometimes differ in colour from the corona and may be cream coloured to pale yellow.[16]\n\n\nThe \"paperwhite\" form, including sections *Jonquilla*, *Apodanthi* and *Narcissus*, has a relatively long, narrow tube and a short, shallow, flaring corona. The flower is horizontal and fragrant.\n\n\nThe \"triandrus\" form is seen in only two species, *N. albimarginatus* (a Moroccan endemic) and *N. triandrus*. It combines features of both the \"daffodil\" and \"paperwhite\" forms, with a well-developed, long, narrow tube and an extended bell-shaped corona of almost equal length. The flowers are pendent.[15]\n\n\n\nAndroecium\n\nThere are six stamens in one to two rows (whorls), with the filaments separate from the corona, attached at the throat or base of the tube (epipetalous), often of two separate lengths, straight or declinate-ascending (curving downwards, then upwards). The anthers are basifixed (attached at their base).[8][5]\n\n\n\nGynoecium\n\nThe ovary is inferior (below the floral parts) and trilocular (three chambered) and there is a pistil with a minutely three lobed stigma and filiform (thread like) style, which is often exserted (extending beyond the tube).[20][5]\n\n\n\nFruit\n\nThe fruit consists of dehiscent loculicidal capsules (splitting between the locules) that are ellipsoid to subglobose (almost spherical) in shape and are papery to leathery in texture.[7]\n\n\n\nSeeds\n\nThe fruit contains numerous subglobose **seeds** which are round and swollen with a hard coat, sometimes with an attached elaiosome. The testa is black[8] and the pericarp dry.[12]\n\n\nMost species have 12 ovules and 36 seeds, although some species such as *N. bulbocodium* have more, up to a maximum of 60. Seeds take five to six weeks to mature. The seeds of sections *Jonquilla* and *Bulbocodium* are wedge-shaped and matte black, while those of other sections are ovate and glossy black. A gust of wind or contact with a passing animal is sufficient to disperse the mature seeds.\n\n\n\n### Chromosomes[edit]\n\n\nChromosome numbers include 2n=14, 22, 26, with numerous aneuploid and polyploid derivatives. The basic chromosome number is 7, with the exception of *N. tazetta*, *N. elegans* and *N. broussonetii* in which it is 10 or 11; this subgenus (*Hermione*) was in fact characterised by this characteristic. Polyploid species include *N. papyraceus* (4x=22) and *N. dubius* (6x=50).[5]\n\n\n\n### Phytochemistry[edit]\n\n\n#### Alkaloids[edit]\n\n\nAs with all Amarylidaceae genera, *Narcissus* contains unique isoquinoline alkaloids. The first alkaloid to be identified was lycorine, from *N. pseudonarcissus* in 1877. These are considered a protective adaptation and are utilised in the classification of species. Nearly 100 alkaloids have been identified in the genus, about a third of all known Amaryllidaceae alkaloids, although not all species have been tested. Of the nine alkaloid ring types identified in the family, *Narcissus* species most commonly demonstrate the presence of alkaloids from within the Lycorine (lycorine, galanthine, pluviine) and Homolycorine (homolycorine, lycorenine) groups. Hemanthamine, tazettine, narciclasine, montanine and galantamine alkaloids are also represented. The alkaloid profile of any plant varies with time, location, and developmental stage.[21] *Narcissus* also contain fructans and low molecular weight glucomannan in the leaves and plant stems.\n\n\n\n#### Fragrances[edit]\n\n\nFragrances are predominantly monoterpene isoprenoids, with a small amount of benzenoids, although *N. jonquilla* has both equally represented. Another exception is *N. cuatrecasasii* which produces mainly fatty acid derivatives. The basic monoterpene precursor is geranyl pyrophosphate, and the commonest monoterpenes are limonene, myrcene, and *trans*-β-ocimene. Most benzenoids are non-methoxylated, while a few species contain methoxylated forms (ethers), *e.g.* *N. bujei*. Other ingredient include indole, isopentenoids and very small amounts of sesquiterpenes. Fragrance patterns can be correlated with pollinators, and fall into three main groups (see Pollination).[17]\n\n\n\n## Taxonomy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Taxonomy of Narcissus\n\n### History[edit]\n\n\n\n> *Genus valde intricatum et numerosissimis dubiis oppressum*  \n>  A genus that is very complex and burdened with numerous uncertainties\n> \n> — Schultes & Schultes fil., *Syst. Veg.* 1829[22]\n> \n\n\n#### Early[edit]\n\n\nThe genus *Narcissus* was well known to the ancient Greeks and Romans. In Greek literature Theophrastus[23] and Dioscorides[24] described *νάρκισσος*, probably referring to *N. poeticus*, although the exact species mentioned in classical literature cannot be accurately established. Pliny the Elder later introduced the Latin form *narcissus*.[25][26][27][28] These early writers were as much interested in the plant's possible medicinal properties as they were in its botanical features and their accounts remained influential until at least the Renaissance (see also Antiquity). Mediaeval and Renaissance writers include Albert Magnus and William Turner, but it remained to Linnaeus to formally describe and name *Narcissus* as a genus in his Species Plantarum (1753) at which time there were six known species.[1][29]\n\n\n\n#### Modern[edit]\n\n\nDe Jussieu (1789) grouped *Narcissus* into a \"family\",[30][31] which he called Narcissi.[32] This was renamed Amaryllideae by Jaume Saint-Hilaire in 1805,[33] corresponding to the modern Amaryllidaceae. For a while, *Narcissus* was considered part of Liliaceae (as in the illustration seen here of *Narcissus candidissimus*),[34][35][36] but then the Amaryllidaceae were split off from it.[37][38]\n\n\n\n![](image)*N. candidissimus* by Pierre-Joseph Redouté, 1808[34]\nVarious authors have adopted either narrow (e.g. Haworth,[39][40] Salisbury[41]) or wide (e.g.Herbert,[42] Spach[43] ) interpretations of the genus.[44] The narrow view treated many of the species as separate genera.[45] Over time, the wider view prevailed with a major monograph on the genus being published by Baker (1875).[46] One of the more controversial genera was *Tapeinanthus*,[47][45] but today it is included in *Narcissus*.[19]\n\n\nThe eventual position of *Narcissus* within the Amaryllidaceae family only became settled in this century with the advent of phylogenetic analysis and the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group system.[29][48] Within Amaryllidaceae the genus *Narcissus* belongs to the Narcisseae tribe, one of 13 within the Amaryllidoideae subfamily.[21] It is one of two sister clades corresponding to genera in the Narcisseae,[49] being distinguished from *Sternbergia* by the presence of a paraperigonium,[4] and is monophyletic.[11]\n\n\n\n### Subdivision[edit]\n\n\nThe infrageneric phylogeny of *Narcissus* still remains relatively unsettled,[21] the taxonomy having proved complex and difficult to resolve,[12][16][19] due to the diversity of the wild species, the ease with which natural hybridization occurs, and extensive cultivation and breeding accompanied by escape and naturalisation.[21][50] Consequently, the number of accepted species has varied widely.[50]\n\n\nDe Candolle, in the first systematic taxonomy of *Narcissus*, arranged the species into named groups, and those names have largely endured for the various subdivisions since and bear his name as their authority.[35][36] The situation was confused by the inclusion of many unknown or garden varieties, and it was not until the work of Baker that the wild species were all grouped as sections under one genus, *Narcissus*.[46]\n\n\nA common classification system has been that of Fernandes [51][52][53] based on cytology, as modified by Blanchard (1990)[54][55] and Mathew (2002).[19] Another is that of Meyer (1966).[56] Fernandes proposed two subgenera based on basal chromosome numbers, and then subdivided these into ten sections as did Blanchard.[55]\n\n\nOther authors (e.g. Webb[12][45]) prioritised morphology over genetics, abandoning subgenera, although Blanchard's system has been one of the most influential. While infrageneric groupings within *Narcissus* have been relatively constant, their status (genera, subgenera, sections, subsections, series, species) has not.[19][21] The most cited system is that of the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) which simply lists ten sections. Three of these are monotypic (contain only one species), while two others contain only two species. Most species are placed in section *Pseudonarcissus*.[57][58] Many of these subdivisions correspond roughly to the popular names for daffodil types, *e.g.* Trumpet Daffodils, Tazettas, Pheasant's Eyes, Hoop Petticoats, Jonquils.[19]\n\n\nThe most hierarchical system is that of Mathew, illustrated here -\n\n\n\n\n\nTable I: Subdivisions of *Narcissus* (Mathew 2002)[19]\n| Subgenus | Section | Subsection | Series | Type species |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| *Narcissus* Pax | *Narcissus* L. |  |  | ![](image)*N. poeticus* L. |\n| *Pseudonarcissus* DCsyn. *Ajax* Spach |  |  | ![](image)*N. pseudonarcissus* L. |\n| *Ganymedes* Salisbury ex Schultes and Schultes fil. |  |  | ![](image)*N. triandrus* L. |\n| *Jonquillae* De Candolle | *Jonquillae* DC |  | ![](image)*N. jonquilla* L. |\n| *Apodanthi* (A.

This led to a revision of the sectional structure.[50][58][60]\nWhile Graham and Barrett (2004)[11] had determined that subgenus *Hermione* was monophyletic, Santos-Gally *et al.* (2011)[58] did not. If two species excluded in the former study are removed from the analysis, the studies are in agreement, the species in question instead forming a clade with subgenus *Narcissus*. Some so-called nothosections have been proposed, to accommodate natural ('ancient') hybrids (nothospecies).[60]\n\n\n\n#### Species[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Narcissus species\n\n![](image)*N. major*, *N. triandrus* and *N. jonquilla*. *Encyclopaedia Londinensis* 1819\nEstimates of the number of species in *Narcissus* have varied widely, from anywhere between 16 and almost 160,[50][54] even in the modern era. Linnaeus originally included six species in 1753, by 1784 there were fourteen[61] by 1819 sixteen,[62] and by 1831 Adrian Haworth had described 150 species.[39]\n\n\nMuch of the variation lies in the definition of species. Thus, a very wide view of each species, such as Webb's[12] results in few species, while a very narrow view such as that of Fernandes[51] results in a larger number.[19] Another factor is the status of hybrids, with a distinction between \"ancient hybrids\" and \"recent hybrids\". The term \"ancient hybrid\" refers to hybrids found growing over a large area, and therefore now considered as separate species, while \"recent hybrid\" refers to solitary plants found amongst their parents, with a more restricted range.[50]\n\n\nFernandes (1951) originally accepted 22 species,[53] Webb (1980) 27.[12] By 1968, Fernandes had 63 species,[51] Blanchard (1990) 65 species,[54] and Erhardt (1993) 66.[63] In 2006 the Royal Horticultural Society's (RHS) *International Daffodil Register and Classified List* [57][64][65] listed 87 species, while Zonneveld's genetic study (2008) resulted in only 36.[50] As of September 2014[update], the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families accepts 52 species, along with at least 60 hybrids,[66] while the RHS has 81 accepted names in its October 2014 list.[67]\n\n\n\n### Evolution[edit]\n\n\nWithin the Narcisseae, *Narcissus* (western Mediterranean) diverged from *Sternbergia* (Eurasia) some time in the Late Oligocene to Early Miocene eras, around 29.3–18.1 Ma. Later, the genus divided into the two subgenera (*Hermione* and *Narcissus*) between 27.4 and 16.1 Ma. The divisions between the sections of *Hermione* then took place during the Miocene period 19.9–7.8 Ma.[58] *Narcissus* appears to have arisen in the area of the Iberian peninsula, southern France and northwestern Italy. Subgenus *Hermione* in turn arose in the southwestern Mediterranean and Northwest Africa.[58]\n\n\n\n### Names and etymology[edit]\n\n\n#### Narcissus[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*N. juncifolius*, Carolus Clusius *Rariorum stirpium* 1576\n![](image)*N. poeticus*, Matthias de l'Obel *Icones stirpium* 1591\nThe derivation of the Latin **narcissus**[68] is from Greek νάρκισσος *narkissos*.[69][70] According to Plutarch *narkissos* has been connected because of the plant's narcotic properties, with *narkē* \"numbness\";[69][71] it may also be connected with hell.[72] On the other hand, its etymology is considered to be clearly Pre-Greek by Beekes.[73]\n\n\nIt is frequently linked to the myth of Narcissus, who became so obsessed with his own reflection in water that he drowned and the narcissus plant sprang from where he died. There is no evidence for the flower being named after Narcissus. *Narcissus poeticus*, which grows in Greece, has a fragrance that has been described as intoxicating.[74] Pliny wrote that the plant was named for its fragrance (ναρκάω *narkao*, \"I grow numb\" ), rather than Narcissus.[21][25][75][76][77] Furthermore, there were accounts of narcissi growing long before the story of Narcissus appeared (see Greek culture).[72][78][Note 2] It has also been suggested that narcissi bending over streams represent the youth admiring his reflection.[79] Linnaeus used the Latin name \"narcissus\" for the plant but was preceded by others such as Matthias de l'Obel (1591)[80] and Clusius (1576).[81] The name Narcissus was not uncommon for men in Roman times.\n\n\nThe plural form of the common name \"narcissus\" has been the cause of some confusion. Dictionaries list \"narcissi\", \"narcissuses\" and \"narcissus\".[74][82][83] However, texts on usage such as Garner[84] and Fowler[85] state that \"narcissi\" is the preferred form. The common name narcissus should not be capitalised.\n\n\n\n#### Daffodil[edit]\n\n\nThe name \"daffodil\" is derived from \"affodell\", a variant of *asphodel*.[86] The narcissus was frequently referred to as the asphodel[75] (see Antiquity). Asphodel in turn appears to come from the Greek \"asphodelos\" (Greek: ἀσφόδελος).[75][87][88][89] The reason for the introduction of the initial \"d\" is not known.[90] From at least the 16th century, \"daffadown dilly\" and \"daffydowndilly\" have appeared as alternative names.[74] Other names include \"Lent lily\".[91][92]\n\n\n\n#### Tsuí-sian[edit]\n\n\nThe Hokkien term can be literally translated as \"water fairy\", where 水 refers to water and 仙 refers to immortals. It is the official provincial flower of Hokkien.[93]\n\n\n\n## Distribution and habitat[edit]\n\n\n### Distribution[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Narcissus species\n\nAlthough the family Amaryllidaceae are predominantly tropical or subtropical as a whole, *Narcissus* occurs primarily in Mediterranean region, with a centre of diversity in the Iberian Peninsula (Spain and Portugal).[19] A few species extend the range into southern France, Italy, the Balkans (*N. poeticus*, *N. serotinus*, *N. tazetta*), and the Eastern Mediterranean (*N. serotinus*)[19][4] including Israel (*N. tazetta*).[11][21] The occurrence of *N. tazetta* in western and central Asia as well as East Asia are considered introductions, albeit ancient[4] (see Eastern cultures). While the exact northern limit of the natural range is unknown, the occurrences of wild *N. pseudonarcissus* in Great Britain, middle and northern Europe are similarly considered ancient introductions.[19][94][95]\n\n\nWhile the Amaryllidaceae are not native to North America, *Narcissus* grows well in USDA hardiness zones 3B through 10, which encompass most of the United States and Canada.[96]\n\n\n*N. elegans* occurs on the North West African Coast (Morocco and Libya), as well as the coastline of Corsica, Sardinia and Italy, and *N. bulbocodium* between Tangier and Algiers and Tangier to Marrakech, but also on the Iberian Peninsula. *N. serotinus* is found along the entire Mediterranean coast. *N. tazetta* occurs as far east as Iran and Kashmir. Since this is one of the oldest species found in cultivation, it is likely to have been introduced into Kashmir. *N. poeticus* and *N. pseudonarcissus* have the largest distribution ranges. *N. poeticus* ranges from the Pyrenees along the Romanian Carpathians to the Black Sea and along the Dalmatian coast to Greece. *N. pseudonarcissus* ranges from the Iberian Peninsula, via the Vosges Mountains to northern France and Belgium, and the United Kingdom where there are still wild stocks in Southern Scotland. The only occurrence in Luxembourg is located near Lellingen, in the municipality of Kiischpelt. In Germany it is found mainly in the nature reserve at Perlenbach-Fuhrtsbachtal and the Eifel National Park, where in the spring at Monschau the meadows are teeming with yellow blooms.[97] One of the most easterly occurrences can be found at Misselberg near Nassau on the Lahn. \n\n\n\n![](image)*N. poeticus* growing in Međulići, near Gacko, Bosnia and Herzegovina\nHowever, unlike the above examples, most species have very restricted endemic ranges[58][98] which may overlap resulting in natural hybrids.[50] For instance in the vicinity of the Portuguese city of Porto where both *N. pseudonarcissus* and *N. triandrus* occur there are found various intersections of the two species while in a small area along part of the Portuguese Mondego river are found intersectional hybrids between *N. scaberulus* and *N. triandrus*.\n\n\nThe biogeography demonstrates a phylogenetic association, for instance subgenus *Hermione* having a lowland distribution, but subgenus *Narcissus* section *Apodanthi* being montane and restricted to Morocco, Spain and Portugal. The remaining sections within subgenus *Narcissus* include both lowland and mountain habitats.[58] Section *Pseudonarcissus*, although widely naturalised, is endemic to the Baetic Ranges of the southeastern Iberian peninsula.[16]\n\n\n\n### Habitats[edit]\n\n\nTheir native habitats are very varied, with different elevations, bioclimatic areas and substrates,[58] being found predominantly in open spaces ranging from low marshes to rocky hillsides and montane pastures, and including grassland, scrub, woods, river banks and rocky crevices.[11][21] Although requirements vary, overall there is a preference for acidic soils, although some species will grow on limestone. *Narcissus scaberulus* will grow on granite soils where it is moist in the growing season but dry in the summer, while *Narcissus dubius* thrives best in regions with hot and dry summers.\n\n\nThe *Pseudonarcissus* group in their natural habitat prefers humid situations such as stream margins, springs, wet pastures, clearings of forests or shrublands with humid soils, and moist hillsides. These habitats tend to be discontinuous in the Mediterranean mountains, producing discrete isolated populations.[16] In Germany, which has relatively little limestone, *Narcissus pseudonarcissus* grows in small groups on open mountain meadows or in mixed forests of fir, beech, oak, alder, ash and birch trees with well-drained soil.\n\n\n\n## Ecology[edit]\n\n\n### Life cycle[edit]\n\n\n*Narcissus* are long-lived perennial geophytes with winter-growing and summer-dormant bulbs[16] that are mainly synanthous (leaves and flowers appearing at the same time).[4] While most species flower in late winter to spring, five species are autumn flowering (*N. broussonetii*, *N. cavanillesii*, *N. elegans*, *N. serotinus*, *N. viridiflorus*).[11] By contrast, these species are hysteranthous (leaves appear after flowering).[4]\n\n\nFlower longevity varies by species and conditions, ranging from 5–20 days.[99] After flowering leaf and root senescence sets in, and the plant appears to be 'dormant' until the next spring, conserving moisture. However, the dormant period is also one of considerable activity within the bulb primordia. It is also a period during which the plant bulb may be susceptible to predators (see § Pests and diseases, below). Like many bulb plants from temperate regions, a period of exposure to cold is necessary before spring growth can begin. This protects the plant from growth during winter when intense cold may damage it. Warmer spring temperatures then initiate growth from the bulb. Early spring growth confers a number of advantages, including relative lack of competition for pollinators, and lack of deciduous shading. [4] The exception to requiring cold temperatures to initiate flowering is *N. tazetta*.[5]\n\n\nPlants may spread clonally through the production of daughter bulbs and division, producing clumps.[16] Narcissus species hybridise readily, although the fertility of the offspring will depend on the parental relationship.[21]\n\n\n\n### Pollination[edit]\n\n\nThe flowers are insect-pollinated, the major pollinators being bees, butterflies, flies, and hawkmoths, while the highly scented night-flowering *N. viridiflorus* is pollinated by crepuscular moths. Pollination mechanisms fall into three groups corresponding to floral morphology (see Description - Flowers).[99]\n\n\n\n1. 'Daffodil' form. Pollinated by bees seeking pollen from anthers within the corona. The broad perianth allows bees (*Bombus*, *Anthophora*, *Andrena*) to completely enter the flower in their search for nectar and/or pollen. In this type, the stigma lies in the mouth of the corona, extending beyond the six anthers, whose single whorl lies well within the corona. The bees come into contact with the stigma before their legs, thorax and abdomen contact the anthers, and this approach herkogamy causes cross pollination.\n2. 'Paperwhite' form. These are adapted to long-tongued Lepidoptera, particularly sphingid moths such as *Macroglossum*, Pieridae and Nymphalidae, but also some long-tongued bees, and flies, all of which are primarily seeking nectar. The narrow tube admits only the insect's proboscis, while the short corona serves as a funnel guiding the tip of the proboscis into the mouth of the perianth tube. The stigma is placed either in the mouth of the tube, just above two whorls of three anthers, or hidden well below the anthers. The pollinators then carry pollen on their probosci or faces. The long-tongued bees cannot reach the nectar at the tube base and so collect just pollen.\n3. 'Triandrus' form. Pollinated by long-tongued solitary bees (*Anthophora*, *Bombus*), which forage for both pollen and nectar. The large corona allows the bees to crawl into the perianth but then the narrow tube prevents further progress, causing them to probe deeply for nectar. The pendant flowers prevent pollination by Lepidoptera. In *N. albimarginatus* there may be either a long stigma with short and mid-length anthers or a short stigma and long anthers (dimorphism). In *N. triandrus* there are three patterns of sexual organs (trimophism) but all have long upper anthers but vary in stigma position and the length of the lower anthers.[11][15]\n\n\nAllogamy (outcrossing) on the whole is enforced through a late-acting (ovarian) self-incompatibility system, but some species such as *N. dubius* and *N. longispathus* are self-compatible producing mixtures of selfed and outcrossed seeds.[17][15]\n\n\n\n### Pests and diseases[edit]\n\n\nDiseases of *Narcissus* are of concern because of the economic consequences of losses in commercial cultivation. Pests include viruses, bacteria, and fungi as well as arthropods and gastropods. For control of pests, see Commercial uses.\n\n\n\nViruses\n\nAphids such as *Macrosiphum euphorbiae* can transmit viral diseases which affect the colour and shape of the leaves, as can nematodes.[100] Up to twenty-five viruses have been described as being able to infect narcissi.[101][102][103] These include the *Narcissus common latent virus* (NCLV, *Narcissus mottling-associated virus*[104]),[Note 3] *Narcissus latent virus* (NLV, *Narcissus mild mottle virus*[104]) which causes green mottling near leaf tips,[105][106] *Narcissus degeneration virus* (NDV),[107] *Narcissus late season yellows virus* (NLSYV) which occurs after flowering, streaking the leaves and stems,[108][109] *Narcissus mosaic virus*, *Narcissus yellow stripe virus* (NYSV, *Narcissus yellow streak virus*[104]), *Narcissus tip necrosis virus* (NTNV) which produces necrosis of leaf tips after flowering[110] and *Narcissus white streak virus* (NWSV).[111]\n\n\nLess host specific viruses include *Raspberry ringspot virus*, *Nerine latent virus* (NeLV) =*Narcissus symptomless virus*,[112] *Arabis mosaic virus* (ArMV),[113] *Broad Bean Wilt Viruses* (BBWV)[114] *Cucumber mosaic virus* (CMV), *Tomato black ring virus* (TBRV), *Tomato ringspot virus* (TomRSV) and *Tobacco rattle virus* (TRV).[114][111]\n\n\nOf these viruses the most serious and prevalent are NDV, NYSV and NWSV.[111][102] NDV is associated with chlorotic leaf striping in *N. tazetta*.[107] Infection with NYSV produces light or grayish-green, or yellow stripes or mottles on the upper two-thirds of the leaf, which may be roughened or twisted. The flowers which may be smaller than usual may also be streaked or blotched. NWSV produces greenish-purple streaking on the leaves and stem turning white to yellow, and premature senescence reducing bulb size and yield.[101] These viruses are primarily diseases of commercial nurseries. The growth inhibition caused by viral infection can cause substantial economic damage.[115][116][117]\n\n\n\nBacteria\n\nBacterial disease is uncommon in *Narcissus* but includes *Pseudomonas* (bacterial streak) and *Pectobacterium carotovorum* sp. *carotovorum* (bacterial soft rot).[111]\n\n\n\nFungi\n\nMore problematic for non-commercial plants is the fungus, *Fusarium oxysporum* f. sp. *narcissi*, which causes basal rot (rotting of the bulbs and yellowing of the leaves). This is the most serious disease of *Narcissus*. Since the fungus can remain in the soil for many years it is necessary to remove infected plants immediately, and to avoid planting further narcissi at that spot for a further five years. Not all species and cultivars are equally susceptible. Relatively resistant forms include *N. triandrus*, *N. tazetta* and *N. jonquilla*.[118][111][119][120]\n\n\nAnother fungus which attacks the bulbs, causing narcissus smoulder, is *Botrytis narcissicola* (*Sclerotinia narcissicola*) and other species of *Botrytis*, including *Botrytis cinerea*,[121][122] particularly if improperly stored. Copper sulfate is used to combat the disease, and infected bulbs are burned. Blue mould rot of bulbs may be caused by infection with species of *Penicillium*, if they have become damaged either through mechanical injury or infestation by mites (see below).[123] Species of Rhizopus (*e.g.* *Rhizopus stolonifer*, *Rhizopus nigricans*) cause bulb soft rot[116][124] and *Sclerotinia bulborum*, black slime disease.[125] A combination of both *Peyronellaea curtisii* (*Stagonosporopsis curtisii*) and *Botrytis narcissicola* causes neck rot in the bulbs.[111]\n\n\nFungi affecting the roots include *Nectria radicicola* (*Cylindrocarpon destructans*), a cause of root rot[125] and *Rosellinia necatrix* causing white root rot,[126] while others affect root and bulb, such as *Aspergillus niger* (black mold), and species of *Trichoderma*, including *T. viride* and *T. harzianum* (=*T. narcissi*) responsible for green mold.[124]\n\n\nOther fungi affect the remainder of the plant. Another *Botrytis* fungus, *Botrytis polyblastis* (*Sclerotinia polyblastis*) causes brown spots on the flower buds and stems (narcissus fire), especially in damp weather and is a threat to the cut flower industry.[127][128] *Ramularia vallisumbrosae* is a leaf spot fungus found in warmer climates, causing narcissus white mould disease.[129] *Peyronellaea curtisii*, the Narcissus leaf scorch, also affects the leaves[115][116][130][131][132] as does its synanamorph, *Phoma narcissi* (leaf tip blight).[133][111] *Aecidium narcissi* causes rust lesions on leaves and stems.[125]\n\n\n\nAnimals\n\nArthropods that are *Narcissus* pests include insects such as three species of fly that have larvae that attack the plants, the narcissus bulb fly *Merodon equestris*, and two species of hoverflies, the lesser bulb flies *Eumerus tuberculatus*[134] and *Eumerus strigatus*. The flies lay their eggs at the end of June in the ground around the narcissi, a single female fly being able to lay up to fifty eggs. The hatching larvae then burrow through the soil towards the bulbs and consume their interiors. They then overwinter in the empty bulb shell, emerging in April to pupate in the soil, from which the adult fly emerges in May.[115][135] The larvae of some moths such as *Korscheltellus lupulina* (the common swift moth) attack *Narcissus* bulbs.[136][115]\n\n\nOther arthropods include Mites such as *Steneotarsonemus laticeps* (Bulb scale mite),[137] *Rhizoglyphus* and *Histiostoma* infest mainly stored bulbs and multiply particularly at high ambient temperature, but do not attack planted bulbs.[115]\n\n\nPlanted bulbs are susceptible to nematodes, the most serious of which is *Ditylenchus dipsaci* (Narcissus eelworm), the main cause of basal plate disease[138] in which the leaves turn yellow and become misshapen. Infested bulbs have to be destroyed; where infestation is heavy avoiding planting further narcissi for another five years.[115][139][140][141] Other nematodes include *Aphelenchoides subtenuis*, which penetrates the roots causing basal plate disease[138][142] and *Pratylenchus penetrans* (lesion nematode) the main cause of root rot in narcissi.\n[143][111] Other nematodes such as the longodorids (*Longidorus* spp. or needle nematodes and *Xiphinema* spp. or dagger nematodes) and the stubby-root nematodes or trichodorids (*Paratrichodorus* spp. and *Trichodorus* spp.) can also act as vectors of virus diseases, such as TBRV and TomRSV, in addition to causing stunting of the roots.[100][142]\n\n\nGastropods such as snails and slugs also cause damage to growth.[115][116][111]\n\n\n\n## Conservation[edit]\n\n\nMany of the smallest species have become extinct, requiring vigilance in the conservation of the wild species.[4][21][75][144] Narcissi are increasingly under threat by over-collection and threats to their natural habitats by urban development and tourism. *N. cyclamineus* has been considered to be either extinct or exceedingly rare[19] but is not currently considered endangered, and is protected.[145] The IUCN Red List describes five species as 'Endangered' (*Narcissus alcaracensis*, *Narcissus bujei*, *Narcissus longispathus*, *Narcissus nevadensis*, *Narcissus radinganorum*). In 1999 three species were considered endangered, five as vulnerable and six as rare.[4]\n\n\nIn response a number of species have been granted protected species status and protected areas (meadows) have been established such as the Negraşi Daffodil Meadow in Romania, or Kempley Daffodil Meadow in the UK. These areas often host daffodil festivals in the spring.\n\n\n\n## Cultivation[edit]\n\n\n### History[edit]\n\n\n\n> *Magna cura non indigent Narcissi*  \n> Most easy of cultivation is the Narcissus\n> \n> — Peter Lauremberg, *Apparatus plantarius: de plantis bulbosis et de plantis tuberosis* 1632[146]\n> \n\n* ![N. serotinus, John Gerard, The Herball 1597](image)\n\n*N. serotinus*, John Gerard, *The Herball* 1597\n* ![Narcissi, Hortus Eystettensis 1613](image)\n\nNarcissi, Hortus Eystettensis 1613\n* ![N. poeticus, Thomas Hale, Eden: Or, a Compleat Body of Gardening 1757](image)\n\n*N. poeticus*, Thomas Hale, *Eden: Or, a Compleat Body of Gardening* 1757\n* ![Narcissus, Peter Lauremberg 1632](image)\n\nNarcissus, Peter Lauremberg 1632\n* ![Narcissi, John Parkinson, Paradisus Terrestris 1629. (8. Great Double Yellow Spanish Daffodil)](image)\n\nNarcissi, John Parkinson, *Paradisus Terrestris* 1629. (8. Great Double Yellow Spanish Daffodil)\n\n\nOf all the flowering plants, the bulbous have been the most popular for cultivation.[147] Of these, narcissi are one of the most important spring flowering bulb plants in the world.[148][8] Indigenous in Europe, the wild populations of the parent species had been known since antiquity. Narcissi have been cultivated from at least as early as the sixteenth century in the Netherlands, when large numbers of bulbs where imported from the field, particularly *Narcissus hispanicus*, which soon became nearly extinct in its native habitat of France and Spain, though still found in the southern part of that country.[149] The only large-scale production at that time related to the double narcissus \"Van Sion\" and cultivars of *N. tazetta* imported in 1557.[150]\n\n\nCultivation is also documented in Britain at this time,[151][152][153] although contemporary accounts show it was well known as a favourite garden and wild flower long before that and was used in making garlands.[154] This was a period when the development of exotic formal gardens and parks was becoming popular, particularly in what is known as the \"Oriental period\" (1560–1620). In his *Hortus Medicus* (1588), the first catalogue of a German garden's plants,[155] Joachim Camerarius the Younger states that nine different types of daffodils were represented in his garden in Nuremberg.[156] After his death in 1598, his plants were moved by Basilius Besler to the gardens they had designed at Willibaldsburg, the bishop's palace at Eichstätt, Upper Bavaria. That garden is described in Besler's *Hortus Eystettensis* (1613) by which time there were 43 different types present.[157] Another German source at this time was Peter Lauremberg who gives an account of the species known to him and their cultivation in his *Apparatus plantarius: de plantis bulbosis et de plantis tuberosis* (1632).[158]\n\n\nWhile Shakespeare's daffodil is the wild or true English daffodil (*N. pseudonarcissus*),[154] many other species were introduced, some of which escaped and naturalised, particularly *N. biflorus* (a hybrid) in Devon and the west of England.[159] Gerard, in his extensive discussion of daffodils, both wild and cultivated (\"bastard daffodils\") described twenty four species in London gardens (1597),[159][160][161] (\"we have them all and every one of them in our London gardens, in great abundance\", p. 114).\n\n\nIn the early seventeenth century, Parkinson helped to ensure the popularity of the daffodil as a cultivated plant[159] by describing a hundred different varieties in his *Paradisus Terrestris* (1629),[162] and introducing the great double yellow Spanish daffodil (*Pseudonarcissus aureus Hispanicus flore pleno* or Parkinson's Daffodil, see illustration) to England.[163]\n\n\n\n\n> I thinke none ever had this kind before myselfe nor did I myself ever see it before the year 1618 for it is of mine own raising and flowering first in my own garden\n> \n> — John Parkinson, *Paradisus Terrestris* 1632[163]\n> \n\n\nAlthough not achieving the sensationalism of tulips, daffodils and narcissi have been much celebrated in art and literature (see § Art, below). The largest demand for narcissi bulbs were large trumpet daffodils, *N. poeticus* and *N. bulbocodium*, and Istanbul became important in the shipping of bulbs to western Europe. By the early baroque period both tulips and narcissi were an important component of the spring garden. By 1739 a Dutch nursery catalogue listed 50 different varieties. A catalog of a Dutch nursery from 1739 already counted 50 varieties. In 1757 Hill gave an account of the history and cultivation of the daffodil in his edited version of the works of Thomas Hale, writing \"The garden does not afford, in its Kind, a prettier plant than this; nor do we know one that has been so early, or so honorably mention'd by all Kinds of Writers\" (see illustration).[164] Interest grew further when varieties that could be grown indoors became available, primarily the bunch flowered (multiple flower heads) *N. tazetta* (Polyanthus Narcissus).[147] However interest varied by country. Maddock (1792) does not include narcissi in his list of the eight most important cultivated flowering plants in England,[165] whereas in the Netherlands van Kampen (1760) stated that *N. tazetta* (*Narcisse à bouquet*) is the fifth most important – \"*Le Narcisse à bouquet est la premiere fleur, après les Jacinthes, les Tulipes les Renoncules, et les Anemones, (dont nous avons déja parlé,) qui merite nôtre attention*\".[166][167] Similarly Philip Miller, in his *Gardeners Dictionary* (1731–1768) refers to cultivation in Holland, Flanders and France, but not England,[168] because it was too difficult, a similar observation was made by Sir James Justice at this time.[169] However, for most species of *Narcissus* Lauremberg's dictum *Magna cura non indigent Narcissi* was much cited.[170]\n\n\nNarcissi became an important horticultural crop in Western Europe in the latter part of the nineteenth century, beginning in England between 1835 and 1855 and the end of the century in the Netherlands.[5] By the beginning of the twentieth century 50 million bulbs of *N. Tazetta* \"Paperwhite\" were being exported annually from the Netherlands to the United States. With the production of triploids such as \"Golden Spur\", in the late nineteenth century, and in the beginning of the twentieth century, tetraploids like \"King Alfred\" (1899), the industry was well established, with trumpet daffodils dominating the market.[149] The Royal Horticultural Society has been an important factor in promoting narcissi, holding the first Daffodil Conference in 1884,[171] while the Daffodil Society, the first organisation dedicated to the cultivation of narcissi was founded in Birmingham in 1898. Other countries followed and the American Daffodil Society which was founded in 1954 publishes *The Daffodil Journal* quarterly, a leading trade publication.\n\n\n\nDaffodil trumpets\n![](image)\n![](image)\n\nNarcissi are now popular as ornamental plants for gardens, parks and as cut flowers, providing colour from the end of winter to the beginning of summer in temperate regions. They are one of the most popular spring flowers[172] and one of the major ornamental spring flowering bulb crops, being produced both for their bulbs and cut flowers, though cultivation of private and public spaces is greater than the area of commercial production.[21] Over a century of breeding has resulted in thousands of varieties and cultivars being available from both general and specialist suppliers.[11] They are normally sold as dry bulbs to be planted in late summer and autumn. They are one of the most economically important ornamental plants.[11][21] Plant breeders have developed some daffodils with double, triple, or ambiguously multiple rows and layers of segments.[6] Many of the breeding programs have concentrated on the corona (trumpet or cup), in terms of its length, shape, and colour, and the surrounding perianth[19] or even as in varieties derived from *N. poeticus* a very reduced form.\n\n\n\n### In gardens[edit]\n\n\nWhile some wild narcissi are specific in terms of their ecological requirements, most garden varieties are relatively tolerant of soil conditions,[173] however very wet soils and clay soils may benefit from the addition of sand to improve drainage.[174] The optimum soil is a neutral to slightly acid pH of 6.5–7.0.[173]\n\n\nBulbs offered for sale are referred to as either 'round' or 'double nose'. Round bulbs are circular in cross section and produce a single flower stem, while double nose bulbs have more than one bulb stem attached at the base and produce two or more flower stems, but bulbs with more than two stems are unusual.[175] Planted narcissi bulbs produce daughter bulbs in the axil of the bulb scales, leading to the dying off the exterior scales.[173] To prevent planted bulbs forming more and more small bulbs, they can be dug up every 5–7 years, and the daughters separated and replanted separately, provided that a piece of the basal plate, where the rootlets are formed, is preserved. For daffodils to flower at the end of the winter or early spring, bulbs are planted in autumn (September–November). This plant does well in ordinary soil but flourishes best in rich soil. Daffodils like the sun but also accept partial shade exposure.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nNarcissi are well suited for planting under small thickets of trees, where they can be grouped as 6–12 bulbs.[176] They also grow well in perennial borders,[173] especially in association with day lilies which begin to form their leaves as the narcissi flowers are fading.[174] A number of wild species and hybrids such as \"Dutch Master\", \"Golden Harvest\", \"Carlton\", \"Kings Court\" and \"Yellow Sun\" naturalise well in lawns,[173] but it is important not to mow the lawn till the leaves start to fade, since they are essential for nourishing the bulb for the next flowering season.[173] Blue Scilla and Muscari which also naturalise well in lawns and flower at the same time as narcissus, make an attractive contrast to the yellow flowers of the latter. Unlike tulips, narcissi bulbs are not attractive to rodents and are sometimes planted near tree roots in orchards to protect them.[177]\n\n\n\n### Propagation[edit]\n\n\nThe commonest form of commercial propagation is by twin-scaling, in which the bulbs are cut into many small pieces but with the two scales still connected by a small fragment of the basal plate. The fragments are disinfected and placed in nutrient media. Some 25–35 new plants can be produced from a single bulb after four years. Micropropagation methods are not used for commercial production but are used for establishing commercial stock.[178] [140]\n\n\n\n### Breeding[edit]\n\n\nFor commercial use, varieties with a minimum stem length of 30 centimetres (12 in) are sought, making them ideal for cut flowers. Florists require blooms that only open when they reach the retail outlet. For garden plants the objectives are to continually expand the colour palette and to produce hardy forms, and there is a particular demand for miniature varieties. The cultivars so produced tend to be larger and more robust than the wild types.[4] The main species used in breeding are *N. bulbocodium*, *N. cyclamineus*, *N. jonquilla*, *N. poeticus*, *N. pseudonarcissus*, *N. serotinus* and *N. tazetta*.[179]\n\n\n*Narcissus pseudonarcissus* gave rise to trumpet cultivars with coloured tepals and corona, while its subspecies *N. pseudonarcissus* subsp. *bicolor* was used for white tepaled varieties. To produce large cupped varieties, *N. pseudonarcissus* was crossed with *N. poeticus*, and to produce small cupped varieties back crossed with *N. poeticus*. Multiheaded varieties, often called \"Poetaz\" are mainly hybrids of *N. poeticus* and *N. tazetta*.[4]\n\n\n\n### Classification[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Range of *Narcissus* cultivars\nMain article: List of Narcissus horticultural divisions\n\nFor horticultural purposes, all *Narcissus* cultivars are split into 13 divisions as first described by Kington (1998),[180] for the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS),[6] based partly upon flower form (shape and length of corona), number of flowers per stem, flowering period and partly upon genetic background. Division 13, which includes wild daffodils, is the exception to this scheme.[181] The classification is a useful tool for planning planting. Most commercially available narcissi come from Divisions 1 (Trumpet), 2 (Large cupped) and 8 (Tazetta).\n\n\nGrowers register new daffodil cultivars by name and colour with the Royal Horticultural Society, which is the international registration authority for the genus.[64] Their *International Daffodil Register* is regularly updated with supplements available online[64] and is searchable.[19][65] The most recent supplement (2014) is the sixth (the fifth was published in 2012).[182] More than 27,000 names were registered as of 2008,[182] and the number has continued to grow. Registered daffodils are given a division number and colour code[183] such as 5 W-W (\"Thalia\").[184] In horticultural usage it is common to also find an unofficial Division 14: Miniatures, which although drawn from the other 13 divisions, have their miniature size in common.[185] Over 140 varieties have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit (See List of Award of Garden Merit narcissus).\n\n\n\n#### Colour code[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*Narcissus* \"Geranium\" **8 W-O**\nDaffodil breeding has introduced a wide range of colours, in both the outer perianth tepal segment and the inner corona. In the registry, daffodils are coded by the colours of each of these two parts. Thus \"Geranium\", Tazetta (Division 8) as illustrated here with a white outer perianth and orange corona is classified as **8 W-O**.\n\n\n\n## Toxicity[edit]\n\n\n### Pharmacology[edit]\n\n\nAll *Narcissus* species contain the alkaloid poison lycorine, mostly in the bulb but also in the leaves.[186] Members of the monocot subfamily Amaryllidoideae present a unique type of alkaloids, the norbelladine alkaloids, which are 4-methylcatechol derivatives combined with tyrosine. They are responsible for the poisonous properties of a number of the species. Over 200 different chemical structures of these compounds are known, of which 79 or more are known from *Narcissus* alone.[187]\n\n\nThe toxic effects of ingesting *Narcissus* products for both humans and animals (such as cattle, goats, pigs, and cats) have long been recognised and they have been used in suicide attempts. Ingestion of *N. pseudonarcissus* or *N. jonquilla* is followed by salivation, acute abdominal pains, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, then neurological and cardiac events, including trembling, convulsions, and paralysis. Death may result if large quantities are consumed.\n\n\nThe toxicity of *Narcissus* varies with species, *N. poeticus* being more toxic than *N. pseudonarcissus*, for instance. The distribution of toxins within the plant also varies, for instance, there is a five times higher concentration of alkaloid in the stem of *N. papyraceus* than in the bulb, making it dangerous to herbivores more likely to consume the stem than the bulb, and is part of the plant's defence mechanisms. The distribution of alkaloids within tissues may also reflect defence against parasites.[21] The bulbs can also be toxic to other nearby plants, including roses, rice, and cabbages, inhibiting growth.[21] For instance placing cut flowers in a vase alongside other flowers shortens the life of the latter.[188]\n\n\n\n### Poisoning[edit]\n\n\nMany cases of poisoning or death have occurred when narcissi bulbs have been mistaken for leeks or onions and cooked and eaten. Recovery is usually complete in a few hours without any specific intervention. In more severe cases involving ingestion of large quantities of bulbs, activated carbon, salts and laxatives may be required, and for severe symptoms intravenous atropine and emetics or stomach pumping may be indicated. However, ingestion of large quantities accidentally is unusual because of a strong unpleasant taste. When narcissi were compared with a number of other plants not normally consumed by animals, narcissi were the most repellent, specifically *N. pseudonarcissus*. Consequently, narcissus alkaloids have been used as repellents and may also discourage fungi, molds, and bacteria.[21]\n\n\nOn 1 May 2009, a number of schoolchildren fell ill at Gorseland Primary School in Martlesham Heath, Suffolk, England, after a daffodil bulb was added to soup during a cookery class.[186]\n\n\n\n### Topical effects[edit]\n\n\nOne of the most common dermatitis problems for flower pickers, packers, florists, and gardeners, \"daffodil itch\", involves dryness, fissures, scaling, and erythema in the hands, often accompanied by subungual hyperkeratosis (thickening of the skin beneath the nails). It is blamed on exposure to calcium oxalate, chelidonic acid or alkaloids such as lycorine in the sap, either due to a direct irritant effect or an allergic reaction.[189][190] It has long been recognised that some cultivars provoke dermatitis more readily than others. *N. pseudonarcissus* and the cultivars \"Actaea\", \"Camparelle\", \"Gloriosa\", \"Grande Monarque\", \"Ornatus\", \"Princeps\" and \"Scilly White\" are known to do so.[21][191]\n\n\nIf bulb extracts come into contact with wounds, both central nervous system and cardiac symptoms may result. The scent can also cause toxic reactions such as headaches and vomiting from *N. bulbocodium*.[21]\n\n\n\n## Uses[edit]\n\n\n### Traditional medicine[edit]\n\n\nDespite the lethal potential of *Narcissus* alkaloids, they have been used for centuries as traditional medicines for a variety of complaints, including cancer. Plants thought to be *N. poeticus* and *N. tazetta* are described in the Bible in the treatment for what is thought to be cancer.[188][192][193][194] In the Classical Greek world Hippocrates (ca. B.C. 460–370) recommended a pessary prepared from narcissus oil for uterine tumors, a practice continued by Pedanius Dioscorides (ca. A.D. 40–90) and Soranus of Ephesus (A.D. 98–138) in the first and second centuries A.D., while the Roman Pliny the Elder (A.D. 23–79), advocated topical use.[188] The bulbs of *N. poeticus* contain the antineoplastic agent narciclasine. This usage is also found in later Arabian, North African, Central American and Chinese medicine during the Middle Ages.[188] In China N. tazetta var. chinensis was grown as an ornamental plant but the bulbs were applied topically to tumors in traditional folk medicine. These bulbs contain pretazettine, an active antitumor compound.[21][194][195]\n\n\n*Narcissus* products have received a variety of other uses. The Roman physician Aulus Cornelius Celsus listed narcissus root in *De Medicina* among medical herbs, described as emollient, erodent, and \"powerful to disperse whatever has collected in any part of the body\". N. tazetta bulbs were used in Turkey as a remedy for abscesses in the belief they were antiphlogistic and analgesic. Other uses include the application to wounds, strains, painful joints, and various local ailments as an ointment called 'Narcissimum'. Powdered flowers have also been used medically, as an emetic, a decongestant and for the relief of dysentery, in the form of a syrup or infusion. The French used the flowers as an antispasmodic, the Arabs the oil for baldness and also an aphrodisiac. In the eighteenth century the Irish herbal of John K'Eogh recommended pounding the roots in honey for use on burns, bruises, dislocations and freckles, and for drawing out thorns and splinters. *N. tazetta* bulbs have also been used for contraception, while the flowers have been recommended for hysteria and epilepsy.[21] In the traditional Japanese medicine of kampo, wounds were treated with narcissus root and wheat flour paste;[196] the plant, however, does not appear in the modern kampo herb list.\n\n\nThere is also a long history of the use of *Narcissus* as a stimulant and to induce trance like states and hallucinations. Sophocles referred to the narcissus as the \"Chaplet of the infernal Gods\",[72] a statement frequently wrongly attributed to Socrates (see Antiquity).[21]\n\n\n\n### Biological properties[edit]\n\n\nExtracts of *Narcissus* have demonstrated a number of potentially useful biological properties including antiviral, prophage induction, antibacterial, antifungal, antimalarial, insecticidal, cytotoxic, antitumor, antimitotic, antiplatelet, hypotensive, emetic, acetylcholine esterase inhibitory, antifertility, antinociceptive, chronotropic, pheromone, plant growth inhibitor, and allelopathic.[21] An ethanol extract of *Narcissus* bulbs was found effective in one mouse model of nociception, para-benzoquinone induced abdominal constriction, but not in another, the hot plate test.[197] Most of these properties are due to alkaloids, but some are also due to mannose-binding lectins. The most-studied alkaloids in this group are galantamine (galanthamine),[198] lycorine, narciclasine, and pretazettine.\n\n\nIt is likely that the traditional use of narcissi for the treatment of cancer was due to the presence of isocarbostyril constituents such as narciclasine, pancratistatin and their congeners. *N. poeticus* contains about 0.12g of narciclasine per kg of fresh bulbs.[188]\n\n\nAcetylcholine esterase inhibition has attracted the most interest as a possible therapeutic intervention, with activity varying by a thousandfold between species, and the greatest activity seen in those that contain galantamine or epinorgalanthamine.[59]\n\n\nThe rodent repellant properties of *Narcissus* alkaloids have been utilised in horticulture to protect more vulnerable bulbs.[199]\n\n\n\n### Therapeutics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Daffodils growing in Wales\nOf all the alkaloids, only galantamine has made it to therapeutic use in humans, as the drug galantamine for Alzheimer's disease. Galantamine is an acetylcholine esterase inhibitor which crosses the blood brain barrier and is active within the central nervous system.[21] Daffodils are grown commercially near Brecon in Powys, Wales, to produce galantamine.[200]\n\n\n\n### Commercial uses[edit]\n\n\nThroughout history the scent of narcissi has been an important ingredient of perfumes, a quality that comes from essential oils rather than alkaloids.[21] Narcissi are also an important horticultural crop,[50][75] and source of cut flowers (floriculture).\n\n\n\n![](image)Daffodil production in the Netherlands\nThe Netherlands, which is the most important source of flower bulbs worldwide is also a major centre of narcissus production. Of 16,700 hectares (ha) under cultivation for flower bulbs, narcissi account for about 1,800 hectares. In the 1990s narcissus bulb production was at 260 million, sixth in size after tulips, gladioli, irises, crocuses and lilies and in 2012 it was ranked third.[148] About two-thirds of the area under cultivation is dedicated to about 20 of the most popular varieties. In the 2009/2010 season, 470 cultivars were produced on 1578 ha. By far the largest area cultivated is for the miniature 'Tête-à-Tête', followed at some distance by 'Carlton'. The largest production cultivars are shown in Table II.[201]\n\n\n\n\n\n Table II: Area under cultivation in the Netherlands, by cultivar\n| Cultivar | Division | Colour | Area (ha)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \"Tête-à-Tête\" | 6: Cyclamineus | Yellow | 663\n |\n| \"Carlton\" | 2: Large cup | Yellow | 54\n |\n| \"Bridal Crown\" | 4: Double | White–Yellow | 51\n |\n| \"Dutch Master\" | 1: Trumpet | Yellow | 47\n |\n| \"Jetfire\" | 6: Cyclamineus | Yellow–Orange | 42\n |\n| \"Ice Follies\" | 2: Large cup | White | 36\n |\n\n\n\"Carlton\" and \"Ice Follies\" (Division 2: Large cup) have a long history of cultivation, together with \"Dutch Master\" and \"Golden Harvest\" (1: yellow). \"Carlton\" and \"Golden Harvest\" were introduced in 1927, and \"Ice Follies\" in 1953. \"Carlton\", with over 9 billion bulbs (350 000 tons), is among the more numerous individual plants produced in the world.[202] The other major areas of production are the United States,[148] Israel which exported 25 million *N. tazetta* cultivar bulbs in 2003,[201] and the United Kingdom.\n\n\nIn the United Kingdom a total of 4100 ha were planted with bulbs, of which 3800 ha were Narcissi, the UK's most important bulb crop, much of which is for export,[203] making this the largest global production centre, about half of the total production area. While some of the production is for forcing, most is for dry bulb production. Bulb production and forcing occurs in the East, while production in the south west is mainly for outdoor flower production.[204] The farm gate value was estimated at £10m in 2007.[205]\n\n\n\n![](image)Narcissi growing at Keukenhof\nProduction of both bulbs and cut flowers takes place in open fields in beds or ridges, often in the same field, allowing adaptation to changing market conditions. Narcissi grow best in mild maritime climates. Compared to the United Kingdom, the harsher winters in the Netherlands require covering the fields with straw for protection. Areas with higher rainfall and temperatures are more susceptible to diseases that attack crops. Production is based on a 1 (UK) or 2 (Netherlands) year cycle. Optimal soil pH is 6.0–7.5. Prior to planting disinfection by hot water takes place, such as immersion at 44.4 °C for three hours.[140]\n\n\nBulbs are harvested for market in the summer, sorted, stored for 2–3 weeks, and then further disinfected by a hot (43.5 °C) bath. This eliminates infestations by narcissus fly and nematodes. The bulbs are then dried at a high temperature, and then stored at 15.5 °C.[4] The initiation of new flower development in the bulb takes place in late spring before the bulbs are lifted, and is completed by mid summer while the bulbs are in storage. The optimal temperature for initiation is 20 °C followed by cooling to 13 °C.[5]\n\n\nTraditionally, sales took place in the daffodil fields prior to harvesting the bulbs, but today sales are handled by Marketing Boards although still before harvesting. In the Netherlands there are special exhibition gardens for major buyers to view flowers and order bulbs, some larger ones may have more than a thousand narcissus varieties on display. While individuals can visit these gardens they cannot buy bulbs at retail, which are only available at wholesale, usually at a minimum of several hundredweight. The most famous display is at Keukenhof, although only about 100 narcissus varieties are on display there.\n\n\n\n#### Forcing[edit]\n\n\nThere is also a market for forced blooms, both as cut flowers and potted flowers through the winter from Christmas to Easter, the long season requiring special preparation by growers.\n\n\n\n##### Cut flowers[edit]\n\n\nFor cut flowers, bulbs larger than 12 cm in size are preferred. To bloom in December, bulbs are harvested in June to July, dried, stored for four days at 34 °C, two weeks at 30 and two weeks at 17–20 °C and then placed in cold storage for precooling at 9 degrees for about 15–16 weeks. The bulbs are then planted in light compost in crates in a greenhouse for forcing at 13 °C–15 °C and the blooms appear in 19–30 days.[4][140]\n\n\n\n##### Potted flowers[edit]\n\n\nFor potted flowers a lower temperature is used for precooling (5 °C for 15 weeks), followed by 16 °C–18 °C in a greenhouse. For later blooming (mid- and late-forcing), bulbs are harvested in July to August and the higher temperatures are omitted, being stored a 17–20 °C after harvesting and placed in cold storage at 9 °C in September for 17–18 (cut flowers) or 14–16 (potted flowers) weeks. The bulbs can then be planted in cold frames, and then forced in a greenhouse according to requirements.[140] *N. tazetta* and its cultivars are an exception to this rule, requiring no cold period. Often harvested in October, bulbs are lifted in May and dried and heated to 30 °C for three weeks, then stored at 25 °C for 12 weeks and planted. Flowering can be delayed by storing at 5 °C–10 °C.[111]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Narcissus in culture\n\n### Symbols[edit]\n\n\n![](image)N. triandrus 'Thalia', considered a grave flower\nThe daffodil is the national flower of Wales, associated with Saint David's Day (March 1). The narcissus is also a national flower symbolising the new year or *Nowruz* in the Iranian culture.\n\n\nIn the West the narcissus is perceived as a symbol of vanity, in the East as a symbol of wealth and good fortune (see § Eastern cultures, below), while in Persian literature, the narcissus is a symbol of beautiful eyes.\n\n\nIn western countries the daffodil is also associated with spring festivals such as Lent and its successor Easter. In Germany the wild narcissus, *N. pseudonarcissus*, is known as the *Osterglocke* or \"Easter bell.\" In the United Kingdom the daffodil is sometimes referred to as the Lenten lily.[91][92][Note 4]\n\n\nAlthough prized as an ornamental flower, some people consider narcissi unlucky, because they hang their heads implying misfortune.[21] White narcissi, such as *N triandrus* \"Thalia\", are especially associated with death, and have been called grave flowers.[206][207] In Ancient Greece narcissi were planted near tombs, and Robert Herrick describes them as portents of death, an association which also appears in the myth of Persephone and the underworld (see § Art, below).\n\n\n\n### Art[edit]\n\n\n#### Antiquity[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Demeter and Persephone surrounded by daffodils - \"*Demeter rejoiced, for her daughter was by her side*\"\nThe decorative use of narcissi dates as far back as ancient Egyptian tombs, and frescoes at Pompeii.[208] They are mentioned in the King James Version of the Bible[209] as the Rose of Sharon[75][210][211][212] and make frequent appearances in classical literature.[164]\n\n\n\n#### Greek culture[edit]\n\n\nThe narcissus appears in two Graeco-Roman myths, that of the youth Narcissus who was turned into the flower of that name, and of the Goddess Persephone snatched into the Underworld by the god Hades while picking the flowers. The narcissus is considered sacred to both Hades and Persephone,[213] and grows along the banks of the river Styx in the underworld.[207]\n\n\nThe Greek poet Stasinos mentioned them in the *Cypria* amongst the flowers of Cyprus.[214] The legend of Persephone comes to us mainly in the seventh century BC Homeric Hymn *To Demeter*,[215] where the author describes the narcissus, and its role as a lure to trap the young Persephone. The flower, she recounts to her mother was the last flower she reached for before being seized.\n\n\nOther Greek authors making reference to the narcissus include Sophocles and Plutarch. Sophocles, in *Oedipus at Colonus* utilises narcissus in a symbolic manner, implying fertility,[216] allying it with the cults of Demeter and her daughter Kore (Persephone),[217] and by extension, a symbol of death.[218] Jebb comments that it is *the flower of imminent death* with its fragrance being narcotic, emphasised by its pale white colour. Just as Persephone reaching for the flower heralded her doom, the youth Narcissus gazing at his own reflection portended his own death.[217] Plutarch refers to this in his *Symposiacs* as numbing the nerves causing a heaviness in the limbs.[219] He refers to Sophocles' \"crown of the great Goddesses\", which is the source of the English phrase \"Chaplet of the infernal Gods\" incorrectly attributed to Socrates.[72]\n\n\nA passage by Moschus, describes fragrant narcissi.[220][221][222] Homer in his *Odyssey*[223][224][225][226] described the underworld as having Elysian meadows carpeted with flowers, thought to be narcissus, as described by Theophrastus.[75][227][Note 5] A similar account is provided by Lucian describing the flowers in the underworld.[228][229][230] The myth of the youth Narcissus is also taken up by Pausanias. He believed that the myth of Persephone long antedated that of Narcissus, and hence discounted the idea the flower was named after the youth.[78]\n\n\n\n#### Roman culture[edit]\n\n\nVirgil, the first known Roman writer to refer to the narcissus, does so in several places, for instance twice in the *Georgics*.[231] Virgil refers to the cup shaped corona of the narcissus flower, allegedly containing the tears of the self-loving youth Narcissus.[232] Milton makes a similar analogy \"*And Daffodillies fill their Cups with Tears*\".[233] Virgil also mentions narcissi three times in the *Eclogues*.[234][235]\n\n\nThe poet Ovid also dealt with the mythology of the narcissus. In his *Metamorphoses*, he recounts the story of the youth Narcissus who, after his death, is turned into the flower,[236][237] and it is also mentioned in Book 5 of his poem *Fasti*.[238][239] This theme of metamorphosis was broader than just *Narcissus*; for instance see crocus, laurel and hyacinth.[240]\n\n\n\n#### Western culture[edit]\n\n\n*I wandered lonely as a Cloud*\n\n\n> \n> ![I](image) wandered lonely as a Cloud  \n> \n> That floats on high o'er Vales and Hills,  \n> \n> When all at once I saw a crowd  \n> \n> A host of dancing Daffodils;  \n> \n> Along the Lake, beneath the trees,  \n> \n> Ten thousand dancing in the breeze.  \n> \n>   \n> \n> The waves beside them danced, but they  \n> \n> Outdid the sparkling waves in glee: –  \n> \n> A poet could not but be gay  \n> \n> In such a laughing company:  \n> \n> I gaz'd – and gaz'd – but little thought  \n> \n> What wealth the shew to me had brought:  \n> \n>   \n> \n> For oft when on my couch I lie  \n> \n> In vacant or in pensive mood,  \n> \n> They flash upon that inward eye  \n> \n> Which is the bliss of solitude,  \n> \n> And then my heart with pleasure fills,  \n> \n> And dances with the Daffodils.\n> \n> \n\n\nWilliam Wordsworth (1804 version)[241] \n\n![](image)\n\nAlthough there is no clear evidence that the flower's name derives directly from the Greek myth, this link between the flower and the myth became firmly part of western culture. The narcissus or daffodil is the most loved of all English plants,[154] and appears frequently in English literature. Many English writers have referred to the cultural and symbolic importance of *Narcissus*[242][243][244][245]). No flower has received more poetic description except the rose and the lily, with poems by authors from John Gower, Shakespeare, Milton (see Roman culture, above), Wordsworth, Shelley and Keats. Frequently the poems deal with self-love derived from Ovid's account.[246][247] Gower's reference to the yellow flower of the legend has been assumed to be the daffodil or *Narcissus*,[248] though as with all references in the older literature to the flower that sprang from the youth's death, there is room for some debate as to the exact species of flower indicated, some preferring *Crocus*.[249] Spenser announces the coming of the Daffodil in *Aprill* of his *Shepheardes Calender* (1579).[250]\n\n\nShakespeare, who frequently uses flower imagery,[245] refers to daffodils twice in *The Winter's Tale* [251] and also *The Two Noble Kinsmen*. Robert Herrick alludes to their association with death in a number of poems.[252][253] Among the English romantic movement writers none is better known than William Wordsworth's short 1804 poem *I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud*[241] which has become linked in the popular mind with the daffodils that form its main image.[75][207][246][254] Wordsworth also included the daffodil in other poems.[255] Yet the description given of daffodils by his sister, Dorothy is just as poetic, if not more so,[170] just that her poetry was prose and appears almost an unconscious imitation of the first section of the Homeric *Hymn to Demeter* (see Greek culture, above).[256][170][257] Among their contemporaries, Keats refers to daffodils among those things capable of bringing \"joy for ever\".[258]\n\n\nMore recently A. E. Housman, using one of the daffodil's more symbolic names (see Symbols), wrote *The Lent Lily* in *A Shropshire Lad*, describing the traditional Easter death of the daffodil.[259]\n\n\nIn *Black Narcissus*, Rumer Godden describes the disorientation of English nuns in the Indian Himalayas, and gives the plant name an unexpected twist, alluding both to narcissism and the effect of the perfume *Narcisse Noir* (Caron) on others. The novel was later adapted into the 1947 British film of the same name. The narcissus also appears in German literature such as that of Paul Gerhardt.[260]\n\n\nIn the visual arts, narcissi are depicted in three different contexts, mythological (Narcissus, Persephone), floral art, or landscapes. The Narcissus story has been popular with painters and the youth is frequently depicted with flowers to indicate this association.[74][240] The Persephone theme is also typified by Waterhouse in his *Narcissus*, the floral motif by van Scorel and the landscape by Van Gogh's *Undergrowth*.\n\n\nNarcissi first started to appear in western art in the late Middle Ages, in panel paintings, particularly those depicting crucifixion. For instance that of the Westfälischer Meister in Köln in the Wallraf-Richartz-Museum, Cologne,[261] where daffodils symbolise not only death but also hope in the resurrection, because they are perennial and bloom at Easter.[207][262][263]\n\n\n\n**Narcissi in art**\n\n* ![Jan van Scorel: Madonna of the Daffodils with the Child and Donors, 1535](image)\n\nJan van Scorel: *Madonna of the Daffodils with the Child and Donors*, 1535\n* ![Vincent van Gogh: Undergrowth with Two Figures, 1890](image)\n\nVincent van Gogh: *Undergrowth with Two Figures*, 1890\n* ![Waterhouse: Narcissus, 1912](image)\n\nWaterhouse: *Narcissus*, 1912\n* ![Crucifixion, Westfälischer Meister c. 1415](image)\n\nCrucifixion, Westfälischer Meister c. 1415\n\n\n#### Eastern cultures[edit]\n\n\nIn Chinese culture *Narcissus tazetta* subsp. *chinensis* (Chinese sacred lilies), which can be grown indoors, is widely used as an ornamental plant.[264][265] It was probably introduced to China by Arab traders travelling the Silk Road prior to the Song dynasty for medicinal use.[50][264][265] Spring-flowering, they became associated with Chinese New Year, signifying good fortune, prosperity and good luck[266] and there are many legends in Chinese culture associated with *Narcissus*.[267][268][269] In contrast to the West, narcissi have not played a significant part in Chinese Garden art,[270] however, Zhao Mengjian in the Southern Song dynasty was noted for his portrayal of narcissi.[271][272] Narcissus bulb carving and cultivation has become an art akin to Japanese bonsai. The Japanese novel *Narcissu* contains many references to the narcissus, where the main characters set out for the famed narcissus fields on Awaji Island.[273][274]\n\n\n\n#### Islamic culture[edit]\n\n\nNarcissi are one of the most popular garden plants in Islamic culture.[275] Prior to the Arab conquest of Persia, the Persian ruler Khosrau I (r. 531–579) is said to have not been able to tolerate them at feasts because they reminded him of eyes, an association that persists to this day.[276] The Persian phrase نرگس شهلا (*narges-e šahlâ*, literally \"a reddish-blue narcissus\")[277] is a well-known metonymy for the \"eye(s) of a mistress\"[277] in the classical poetries of the Persian, Urdu,[278] Ottoman Turkish, Azerbaijani and Chagatai languages; to this day also the vernacular names of some narcissus cultivars (for example, *Shahla-ye Shiraz* and *Shahla-ye Kazerun*).[279] As described by the poet Ghalib (1797–1869), \"God has given the eye of the narcissus the power of seeing\".[276] The eye imagery is also found in a number of poems by Abu Nuwas.[280][281][282][283] Another poet who refers to narcissi, is Rumi. Even the prophet Mohammed is said to have praised the narcissus,[284] though some of the sayings that were cited as proof are considered \"weak\" records.[285]\n\n\n\n**Narcissi in Eastern and Islamic cultures**\n\n* ![Chinese Sacred Lily](image)\n\nChinese Sacred Lily\n* ![Chinese decorative carved Narcissus bulb](image)\n\nChinese decorative carved *Narcissus* bulb\n* ![N. poeticus symbolising the eye in Islamic culture](image)\n\n*N. poeticus* symbolising the eye in Islamic culture\n\n\n### Popular culture[edit]\n\n\nThe word \"daffodil\" has been used widely in popular culture, from Dutch cars (DAF Daffodil) to Swedish rock bands (The Daffodils) to slurs against homosexuals and cross-dressers (as in the film *J. Edgar*, when Hoover's mother explains why real-life cross-dresser Barton Pinkus[286] was called \"Daffy\" (short for \"Daffodil\" and the equivalent of a pansy[287]), and admonishes, \"I'd rather have a dead son than a daffodil for a son\".[288][289][290][291][292]\n\n\n\n### Festivals[edit]\n\n\nIn some areas where narcissi are prevalent, their blooming in spring is celebrated in festivals. For instance, the slopes around Montreux, Switzerland and its associated riviera come alive with blooms each May (*May Snow*) at the annual Narcissi Festival.[293] Festivals are also held in many other countries.\n\n\n\n### Cancer[edit]\n\n\nVarious cancer charities around the world, such as the American Cancer Society,[294] Cancer Society,[295] Cancer Council,[296] Irish Cancer Society,[297] and Marie Curie in the UK[298] use the daffodil as a fundraising symbol on \"Daffodil Days\".[299]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of Narcissus species\n* List of Narcissus horticultural divisions\n* List of AGM narcissus – Narcissus cultivars given the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit\n* Narcissus in culture\n* Orange trumpet\n* Taxonomy of Narcissus\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The word \"daffodil\" is also applied to related genera such as *Sternbergia*, *Ismene* and *Fritillaria meleagris*. It has been suggested that the word \"Daffodil\" be restricted to the wild species of the British Isles, *N. pseudonarcissus*. (Halevy 1985, Rees A. R. Narcissus pp. 268–271)\n2. **^** Prior here refers to the poet *Pamphilus*, but it is likely he meant *Pamphos*.\n3. **^** This *Carlavirus* should not be confused with the similarly named *Narcissus latent virus* which is a *Macluravirus*.\n4. **^** Rarely \"Lentern\", especially ecclesiastical usage as here, or dialect, particularly Scottish (Masefield 2014, p. 104)(Jamieson 1879, Care Sonday vol I p. 284)(Wright 1905, vol 3 H–L, Lentren p. 575)\n5. **^** The Asphodel of the Greek underworld has been variously associated with the white *Asphodelus ramosus* (Macmillan (1887)) or the yellow *Asphodeline lutea* (Graves (1949)), previously classified as *Asphodelus luteus*.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Linnaeus, Carl (1753). \"Narcissus\". *Species Plantarum*.

It was introduced to Europe in the 16th century. It is widely cultivated everywhere in the temperate world for its strongly fragrant flowers which appear exceptionally early in the season, and frequently forced to flower at Christmas time.[2]\n\n\n\n\n## Description[edit]\n\n\nIt is a bulbous plant, with a 3–7 cm (1.2–2.8 in) diameter bulb. The leaves are strap-shaped, 15–35 cm (5.9–13.8 in) long and 1–3 cm (0.39–1.18 in) broad, with a soft, succulent texture, and produced in a basal whorl. The flowering stem is a raceme, which grows to 20–35 cm (7.9–13.8 in) (rarely to 45 cm (18 in)) tall, bearing 2–50 fragrant purple flowers 2–3.5 cm long with a tubular, six-lobed perianth.\n\n\n\n## Mythology[edit]\n\n\nIn Greek mythology, Hyacinth was a young man admired by Apollo and Zephyr, but killed by a discus in a jealous fight between the two gods; a flower was allegedly named after him when it sprang from his blood. However, Theophrastus describes both a cultivated and a wild plant called ὑάκινθος (*hyakinthos*), neither of which are considered to be the modern hyacinth.[3]\n\n\n\n## Reproduction[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This article **needs additional citations for verification**. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed.*Find sources:* \"Hyacinthus orientalis\" – news **·** newspapers **·** books **·** scholar **·** JSTOR *(February 2023)* *(Learn how and when to remove this message)*\n |\n\n\nThe reproduction of the plant in cultivation can be done easily by dividing the newly appeared bulbs from the main plant. In nature, this method is also used by the hyacinth, but the plant also has a specific kind of reproduction by seeds.\n\n\nThe plant is pollinated by different insects such as honey bees. The flowers are very fragrant and attract the insects by rewarding them with nectar.[4]\n\n\nAfter flowering, the ripening of the seed capsules begins. They are fleshy, spherical structures.[4] When the capsules reach maturity, they get dried and split into three parts. Each part has two subdivisions and contains a different quantity of seeds. The seeds are black grains with one white elaiosome of variable size. The seeds are dispersed through myrmecochory; that is, ants find the seeds and take them into their burrows, where they use the elaiosome for food. There, the seeds can germinate.\n\n\n\n## Cultivation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hyacinth cultivars, showing many of the available colors\n*H. orientalis* has a long history of cultivation as an ornamental plant, grown across the Mediterranean region, and later France (where it is used in perfumery), the Netherlands (a major centre of cultivation) and elsewhere.\n\n\nIt flowers in the early spring, growing best in full sun to part shade in well-drained, but not dry, soil. It requires a winter dormancy period, and will only persist in cold-weather regions. It is grown for the clusters of strongly fragrant, brightly coloured flowers. Over 2,000 cultivars have been selected and named, with flower colour in shades of blue, white, pale yellow, pink, red or purple; most cultivars have also been selected for denser flower spikes than the wild type, bearing 40–100 or more flowers on each spike.\n\n\n\n### Cultivars[edit]\n\n\n![](image)’Delft Blue’\nThe following cultivars have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit:-[5]\n\n\n\n* 'Aida'[6] (deep blue)\n* 'Anna Marie'[7] (pink)\n* 'Blue Festival'[8] (pale blue)\n* 'Blue Jacket'[9] (blue)\n* 'Chicago'[10] (violet blue)\n* 'City of Haarlem'[11] (cream)\n* 'Delft Blue'[12] (blue)\n* 'Fairly'[13] (white)\n* 'Gipsy Queen'[14] (salmon pink)\n* 'Jan Bos'[15] (deep pink)\n* 'L'Innocence'[16] (white)\n* 'Miss Saigon'[17] (deep pink)\n* 'Ostara'[18] (blue)\n* 'Paul Hermann'[19] (mauve-pink)\n* 'Royal Navy'[20] (dark blue)\n* 'Yellow Queen'[21] (cream yellow)\n\n### Forcing[edit]\n\n\nHyacinths are among the most popular bulbs selected for the process known as forcing, whereby plants are induced to flower earlier than their natural season (in this case, Christmas). It involves depriving bulbs of light and warmth for a period of several weeks, before growing them on in a bright, cool place such as a kitchen windowsill. It is possible to grow the bulbs in a narrow-necked vase of water, thus being able to view the root growth. Alternatively, bulbs can be purchased pre-forced.[22][23]\n\n\n\n## Toxicity[edit]\n\n\n*H. orientalis* contains alkaloids and is toxic if eaten in large quantities. The bulb, however, is the most poisonous part and should not be ingested under any circumstances.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of poisonous plants\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"The Plant List: A Working List of All Plant Species\".\n2. **^** Brickell, Christopher, ed.

It was introduced to Europe in the 16th century. It is widely cultivated everywhere in the temperate world for its strongly fragrant flowers which appear exceptionally early in the season, and frequently forced to flower at Christmas time.[2]\n\n\n\n\n## Description[edit]\n\n\nIt is a bulbous plant, with a 3–7 cm (1.2–2.8 in) diameter bulb. The leaves are strap-shaped, 15–35 cm (5.9–13.8 in) long and 1–3 cm (0.39–1.18 in) broad, with a soft, succulent texture, and produced in a basal whorl. The flowering stem is a raceme, which grows to 20–35 cm (7.9–13.8 in) (rarely to 45 cm (18 in)) tall, bearing 2–50 fragrant purple flowers 2–3.5 cm long with a tubular, six-lobed perianth.\n\n\n\n## Mythology[edit]\n\n\nIn Greek mythology, Hyacinth was a young man admired by Apollo and Zephyr, but killed by a discus in a jealous fight between the two gods; a flower was allegedly named after him when it sprang from his blood. However, Theophrastus describes both a cultivated and a wild plant called ὑάκινθος (*hyakinthos*), neither of which are considered to be the modern hyacinth.[3]\n\n\n\n## Reproduction[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This article **needs additional citations for verification**. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed.*Find sources:* \"Hyacinthus orientalis\" – news **·** newspapers **·** books **·** scholar **·** JSTOR *(February 2023)* *(Learn how and when to remove this message)*\n |\n\n\nThe reproduction of the plant in cultivation can be done easily by dividing the newly appeared bulbs from the main plant. In nature, this method is also used by the hyacinth, but the plant also has a specific kind of reproduction by seeds.\n\n\nThe plant is pollinated by different insects such as honey bees. The flowers are very fragrant and attract the insects by rewarding them with nectar.[4]\n\n\nAfter flowering, the ripening of the seed capsules begins. They are fleshy, spherical structures.[4] When the capsules reach maturity, they get dried and split into three parts. Each part has two subdivisions and contains a different quantity of seeds. The seeds are black grains with one white elaiosome of variable size. The seeds are dispersed through myrmecochory; that is, ants find the seeds and take them into their burrows, where they use the elaiosome for food. There, the seeds can germinate.\n\n\n\n## Cultivation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hyacinth cultivars, showing many of the available colors\n*H. orientalis* has a long history of cultivation as an ornamental plant, grown across the Mediterranean region, and later France (where it is used in perfumery), the Netherlands (a major centre of cultivation) and elsewhere.\n\n\nIt flowers in the early spring, growing best in full sun to part shade in well-drained, but not dry, soil. It requires a winter dormancy period, and will only persist in cold-weather regions. It is grown for the clusters of strongly fragrant, brightly coloured flowers. Over 2,000 cultivars have been selected and named, with flower colour in shades of blue, white, pale yellow, pink, red or purple; most cultivars have also been selected for denser flower spikes than the wild type, bearing 40–100 or more flowers on each spike.\n\n\n\n### Cultivars[edit]\n\n\n![](image)’Delft Blue’\nThe following cultivars have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit:-[5]\n\n\n\n* 'Aida'[6] (deep blue)\n* 'Anna Marie'[7] (pink)\n* 'Blue Festival'[8] (pale blue)\n* 'Blue Jacket'[9] (blue)\n* 'Chicago'[10] (violet blue)\n* 'City of Haarlem'[11] (cream)\n* 'Delft Blue'[12] (blue)\n* 'Fairly'[13] (white)\n* 'Gipsy Queen'[14] (salmon pink)\n* 'Jan Bos'[15] (deep pink)\n* 'L'Innocence'[16] (white)\n* 'Miss Saigon'[17] (deep pink)\n* 'Ostara'[18] (blue)\n* 'Paul Hermann'[19] (mauve-pink)\n* 'Royal Navy'[20] (dark blue)\n* 'Yellow Queen'[21] (cream yellow)\n\n### Forcing[edit]\n\n\nHyacinths are among the most popular bulbs selected for the process known as forcing, whereby plants are induced to flower earlier than their natural season (in this case, Christmas). It involves depriving bulbs of light and warmth for a period of several weeks, before growing them on in a bright, cool place such as a kitchen windowsill. It is possible to grow the bulbs in a narrow-necked vase of water, thus being able to view the root growth. Alternatively, bulbs can be purchased pre-forced.[22][23]\n\n\n\n## Toxicity[edit]\n\n\n*H. orientalis* contains alkaloids and is toxic if eaten in large quantities. The bulb, however, is the most poisonous part and should not be ingested under any circumstances.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of poisonous plants\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"The Plant List: A Working List of All Plant Species\".\n2. **^** Brickell, Christopher, ed.

Their flowers are usually large, showy, and brightly coloured, generally red, orange, pink, yellow, or white (usually in warm colours). They often have a different coloured blotch at the base of the tepals (petals and sepals, collectively), internally. Because of a degree of variability within the populations and a long history of cultivation, classification has been complex and controversial. The tulip is a member of the lily family, Liliaceae,[1] along with 14 other genera, where it is most closely related to *Amana*, *Erythronium*, and *Gagea* in the tribe Lilieae. \n\n\nThere are about seventy-five species, and these are divided among four subgenera. The name \"tulip\" is thought to be derived from a Persian word for turban, which it may have been thought to resemble by those who discovered it. Tulips were originally found in a band stretching from Southern Europe to Central Asia, but since the seventeenth century have become widely naturalised and cultivated (*see map*). In their natural state, they are adapted to steppes and mountainous areas with temperate climates. Flowering in the spring, they become dormant in the summer once the flowers and leaves die back, emerging above ground as a shoot from the underground bulb in early spring.\n\n\nGrowing wild over much of the Near East and Central Asia, tulips had probably been cultivated in Persia from the 10th century. By the 15th century, tulips were among the most prized flowers; becoming the symbol of the later Ottomans. Tulips were cultivated in Byzantine Constantinople as early as 1055 but they did not come to the attention of Northern Europeans until the sixteenth century, when Northern European diplomats to the Ottoman court observed and reported on them.[2] They were rapidly introduced into Northern Europe and became a much-sought-after commodity during tulip mania. Tulips were frequently depicted in Dutch Golden Age paintings, and have become associated with the Netherlands, the major producer for world markets, ever since. In the seventeenth-century Netherlands, during the time of the tulip mania, an infection of tulip bulbs by the tulip breaking virus created variegated patterns in the tulip flowers that were much admired and valued. While truly broken tulips are not cultivated anymore, the closest available specimens today are part of the group known as the Rembrandts – so named because Rembrandt painted some of the most admired breaks of his time.[3]\n\n\nBreeding programmes have produced thousands of hybrid and cultivars in addition to the original species (known in horticulture as botanical tulips). They are popular throughout the world, both as ornamental garden plants and as cut flowers.\n\n\n\n\n## Description[edit]\n\n\nTulip morphology\n![Collection of tulip bulbs, some sliced to show interior scales](image)\n**Bulbs**, showing tunic and scales\n![Flower of Tulipa orphanidea, showing cup shape](image)\nCup-shaped flower of *Tulipa orphanidea*\n![Photograph of Tulipa clusiana, showing six identical tepals (petals and sepals)](image)\nStar-shaped flower of *Tulipa clusiana* with three sepals and three petals, forming six identical tepals\n\nTulips are perennial herbaceous bulbiferous geophytes that bloom in spring and die back after flowering to an underground storage bulb. Depending on the species, tulip plants can be between 10 and 70 cm (4 and 28 inches) high.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nTulip stems have few leaves. Larger species tend to have multiple leaves. Plants typically have two to six leaves, some species up to 12. The tulip's leaf is cauline (born on a stem), strap-shaped, with a waxy coating, and the leaves are alternate (alternately arranged on the stem), diminishing in size the further up the stem. These fleshy blades are often bluish-green in colour.[4][5][6] The bulbs are truncated basally and elongated towards the apex. They are covered by a protective tunic (tunicate) which can be glabrous or hairy inside.[7][6]\n\n\n\n### Flowers[edit]\n\n\nThe tulip's flowers are usually large and are actinomorphic (radially symmetric) and hermaphrodite (contain both male (androecium) and female (gynoecium) characteristics), generally erect, or more rarely pendulous, and are arranged more usually as a single terminal flower, or when pluriflor as two to three (e.g. *Tulipa turkestanica*), but up to four, flowers on the end of a floriferous stem (scape), which is single arising from amongst the basal leaf rosette. In structure, the flower is generally cup or star-shaped. As with other members of Liliaceae the perianth is undifferentiated (perigonium) and biseriate (two whorled), formed from six free (i.e. apotepalous) caducous tepals arranged into two separate whorls of three parts (trimerous) each. The two whorls represent three petals and three sepals, but are termed tepals because they are nearly identical. The tepals are usually petaloid (petal-like), being brightly coloured, but each whorl may be different, or have different coloured blotches at their bases, forming darker colouration on the interior surface. The inner petals have a small, delicate cleft at the top, while the sturdier outer ones form uninterrupted ovals.[3]\n\n\nThe flowers have six distinct, basifixed introrse stamens arranged in two whorls of three, which vary in length and may be glabrous or hairy. The filaments are shorter than the tepals and dilated towards their base.[7] The style is short or absent and each stigma has three distinct lobes, and the ovaries are superior, with three chambers.[7]\n\n\n\n#### Colours[edit]\n\n\nThe \"Semper Augustus\" was the most expensive tulip during the 17th-century tulip mania. “The colour is white, with Carmine on a blue base, and with an unbroken flame right to the top” – wrote Nicolas van Wassenaer in 1624 after seeing the tulip in the garden of one Dr Adriaen Pauw, a director of the new East India Company. With limited specimens in existence at the time and most owned by Pauw, his refusal to sell any flowers, despite wildly escalating offers, is believed by some to have sparked the mania.[3]\n\n\nTulip flowers come in a wide variety of colours, except pure blue (several tulips with \"blue\" in the name have a faint violet hue), and have absent nectaries.[4][5][6][7] Tulip flowers are generally bereft of scent and are the coolest of floral characters. The Dutch regarded this lack of scent as a virtue, as it demonstrates the flower's chasteness.[3]\n\n\nWhile tulips can be bred to display a wide variety of colours, black tulips have historically been difficult to achieve. The Queen of the Night tulip is as close to black as a flower gets, though it is, in fact, a dark and glossy maroonish purple - nonetheless, an effect prized by the Dutch.[3] The first truly black tulip was bred in 1986 by a Dutch flower grower in Bovenkarspel, Netherlands. The specimen was created by cross-breeding two deep purple tulips, the Queen of the Night and Wienerwald tulips.[8]\n\n\n\n### Fruit[edit]\n\n\nThe tulip's fruit is a globose or ellipsoid capsule with a leathery covering and an ellipsoid to globe shape. Each capsule contains numerous flat, disc-shaped seeds in two rows per chamber.[9] These light to dark brown seeds have very thin seed coats and endosperm that do not normally fill the entire seed.[10][7]\n\n\n\n### Phytochemistry[edit]\n\n\nTulipanin is an anthocyanin found in tulips. It is the 3-rutinoside of delphinidin. The chemical compounds named tuliposides and tulipalins can also be found in tulips and are responsible for allergies.[11] Tulipalin A, or α-methylene-γ-butyrolactone, is a common allergen, generated by hydrolysis of the glucoside tuliposide A. It induces a dermatitis that is mostly occupational and affects tulip bulb sorters and florists who cut the stems and leaves.[12] Tulipanin A and B are toxic to horses, cats and dogs.[13] The colour of a tulip is formed from two pigments working in concert; a base colour that is always yellow or white, and a second laid-on anthocyanin colour. The mix of these two hues determines the visible unitary colour. The breaking of flowers occurs when a virus suppresses anthocyanin and the base colour is exposed as a streak.[3]\n\n\n\n### Fragrance[edit]\n\n\nThe great majority of tulips, both species and cultivars, have no discernable scent, but a few of both are scented to a degree, and Anna Pavord describes *T. Hungarica* as \"strongly scented\",[14] and among cultivars, some such as \"Monte Carlo\" and \"Brown Sugar\" are \"scented\", and \"Creme Upstar\" \"fragrant\".[15]\n\n\n\n## Taxonomy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Taxonomy of Tulipa\n\n*Tulipa* is a genus of the lily family, Liliaceae, once one of the largest families of monocots, but which molecular phylogenetics has reduced to a monophyletic grouping with only 15 genera. Within Liliaceae, *Tulipa* is placed within Lilioideae, one of three subfamilies, with two tribes. Tribe Lilieae includes seven other genera in addition to *Tulipa*.\n\n\n\n### Subdivision[edit]\n\n\nThe genus, which includes about 75 species, is divided into four subgenera.[6]\n\n\n\n* *Clusianae* (4 species)\n* *Orithyia* (4 species)\n* *Tulipa* (52 species)\n* *Eriostemones* (16 species)\n\n\n### Etymology[edit]\n\n\nThe word *tulip*, first mentioned in western Europe in or around 1554 and seemingly derived from the \"Turkish Letters\" of diplomat Ogier Ghiselin de Busbecq, first appeared in English as *tulipa* or *tulipant*, entering the language by way of French: *tulipe* and its obsolete form *tulipan* or by way of Modern Latin *tulipa*, from Ottoman Turkish *tülbend* (\"muslin\" or \"gauze\"), and may be ultimately derived from the Persian: دلبند *delband* (\"Turban\"), this name being applied because of a perceived resemblance of the shape of a tulip flower to that of a turban.[16] This may have been due to a translation error in early times when it was fashionable in the Ottoman Empire to wear tulips on turbans. The translator possibly confused the flower for the turban.[6]\n\n\nOgier Ghiselin de Busbecq stated that the \"Turks\" used the word *tulipan* to describe the flower. Extensive speculation has tried to understand why he would state this, given that the Turkish word for tulip is *lale*. It is from this speculation that *tulipan* being a translation error referring to turbans is derived. This etymology has been challenged and makes no assumptions about possible errors. At no point does Busbecq state this was the word used in Turkey, he simply states it was used by the \"Turks\". On his way to Constantinople Busbecq states he travelled through Hungary and used Hungarian guides. Until recent times \"Turk\" was a common term when referring to Hungarians. The word *tulipan* is in fact the Hungarian word for tulip. As long as one recognizes \"Turk\" as a reference to Hungarians, no amount of speculation is required to reconcile the word's origin or form. Busbecq may have been simply repeating the word used by his \"Turk/Hungarian\" guides.[17]\n\n\nThe Hungarian word *tulipan* may be adopted from an Indo-Aryan reference to the tulip as a symbol of resurrection, *tala* meaning \"bottom or underworld\" and *pAna* meaning \"defence\".[17] Prior to arriving in Europe the Hungarians, and other Finno-Ugrians, embraced the Indo-Iranian cult of the dead, Yima/Yama, and would have been familiar with all of its symbols including the tulip.[18]\n\n\n\n## Distribution and habitat[edit]\n\n\n![Map from Turkmenistan to Tien-Shan](image)Eastern end of the tulip range from Turkmenistan on the eastern shore of the Caspian Sea to the Pamir-Alai and Tien-Shan mountains\nTulips are mainly distributed along a band corresponding to latitude 40° north, from southeast of Europe (Greece, Albania, North Macedonia, Kosovo, Southern Serbia, Bulgaria, most part of Romania, Ukraine, Russia) and Turkey in the west, through the Levant (Syria, Israel, Palestinian Territories, Lebanon and Jordan) and the Sinai Peninsula. From there it extends eastwards through Jerevan (Armenia), and Baku (Azerbaijan) and on the eastern shore of the Caspian Sea through Turkmenistan, Bukhara, Samarkand and Tashkent (Uzbekistan), to the eastern end of the range in the Pamir-Alai and Tien-Shan mountains in Central Asia, which form the centre of diversity.[19] Further to the east, *Tulipa* is found in the western Himalayas, southern Siberia, Inner Mongolia, and as far as the northwest of China. While authorities have stated that no tulips west of the Balkans are native,[20] subsequent identification of *Tulipa sylvestris* subsp. *australis* as a native of the Iberian peninsula and adjacent North Africa shows that this may be a simplification. In addition to these regions in the west tulips have been identified in Greece, Cyprus and the Balkans. In the south, Iran marks its furthest extent, while the northern limit is Ukraine.[21] Although tulips are also throughout most of the Mediterranean and Europe, these regions do not form part of the natural distribution. Tulips were brought to Europe by travellers and merchants from Anatolia and Central Asia for cultivation, from where they escaped and naturalised (*see map*). For instance, less than half of those species found in Turkey are actually native.[20] These have been referred to as neo-tulipae.[22][23][6]\n\n\nTulips are indigenous to mountainous areas with temperate climates, where they are a common element of steppe and winter-rain Mediterranean vegetation. They thrive in climates with long, cool springs and dry summers. Tulips are most commonly found in meadows, steppes and chaparral, but also introduced in fields, orchards, roadsides and abandoned gardens.[22][6]\n\n\n\n## Ecology[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Variegation produced by the tulip breaking virus\n*Botrytis tulipae* is a major fungal disease affecting tulips, causing cell death and eventually the rotting of the plant.[24] Other pathogens include anthracnose, bacterial soft rot, blight caused by *Sclerotium rolfsii*, bulb nematodes, other rots including blue molds, black molds and mushy rot.[25]\n\n\nThe fungus *Trichoderma viride* can infect tulips, producing dried leaf tips and reduced growth, although symptoms are usually mild and only present on bulbs growing in glasshouses.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nVariegated tulips admired during the Dutch tulipomania gained their delicately feathered patterns from an infection with the tulip breaking virus, a mosaic virus that was carried by the green peach aphid, *Myzus persicae*. While the virus produces fantastically streaked flowers, it also weakens plants and reduces the number of offsets produced. Dutch growers would go to extraordinary lengths during tulipomania to make tulips break, borrowing alchemists’ techniques and resorting to sprinkling paint powders of the desired hue or pigeon droppings onto flower roots.[3]\n\n\nTulips affected by the mosaic virus are called \"broken\"; while such plants can occasionally revert to a plain or solid colouring, they will remain infected and have to be destroyed. Today the virus is almost eradicated from tulip growers' fields. The multicoloured patterns of modern varieties result from breeding; they normally have solid, un-feathered borders between the colours.\n\n\nTulip growth is also dependent on temperature conditions. Slightly germinated plants show greater growth if subjected to a period of cool dormancy, known as vernalisation. Furthermore, although flower development is induced at warmer temperatures (20–25 °C or 68–77 °F), elongation of the flower stalk and proper flowering is dependent on an extended period of low temperature (< 10 °C or 50 °F).[26] Tulip bulbs imported to warm-winter areas are often planted in autumn to be treated as annuals.\n\n\nThe colour of tulip flowers also varies with growing conditions.[27]\n\n\n\n## Cultivation[edit]\n\n\n### History[edit]\n\n\n#### Islamic World[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*Tulipa sylvestris* subsp. *australis*[a] with seedpod by Sydenham Edwards (1804)[28]\nCultivation of the tulip began in Iran (Persia), probably in the 10th century.[6] Early cultivars must have emerged from hybridisation in gardens from wild collected plants, which were then favoured, possibly due to flower size or growth vigour. The tulip is not mentioned by any writer from antiquity,[29] therefore it seems probable that tulips were introduced into Anatolia only with the advance of the Seljuks.[29] In the Ottoman Empire, numerous types of tulips were cultivated and bred,[30] and today, 14 species can still be found in Turkey.[29] Tulips are mentioned by Omar Kayam and Jalāl ad-Dīn Rûmi.[29] Species of tulips in Turkey typically come in red, less commonly in white or yellow. The Ottoman Turks had discovered that these wild tulips were great changelings, freely hybridizing (though it takes 7 years to show colour) but also subject to mutations that produced spontaneous changes in form and colour.[3]\n\n\nA paper by Arthur Baker[31] reports that in 1574, Sultan Selim II ordered the Kadi of A‘azāz in Syria to send him 50,000 tulip bulbs. However, John Harvey[32] points out several problems with this source, and there is also the possibility that tulips and hyacinth (*sümbüll*), originally Indian spikenard (*Nardostachys jatamansi*) have been confused. Sultan Selim also imported 300,000 bulbs of *Kefe Lale* (also known as Cafe-Lale, from the medieval name Kaffa, probably *Tulipa schrenkii*) from Kefe in Crimea, for his gardens in the Topkapı Sarayı in Istanbul.[33]\n\n\nIt is also reported that shortly after arriving in Constantinople in 1554, Ogier Ghislain de Busbecq, ambassador of the Austrian Habsburgs to the court of Suleyman the Magnificent, claimed to have introduced the tulip to Europe by sending a consignment of bulbs west. The fact that the tulip's first official trip west took it from one court to the other could have contributed to its ascendency.[3]\n\n\nSultan Ahmet III maintained famous tulip gardens in the summer highland pastures (*Yayla*) at Spil Dağı above the town of Manisa.[34] They seem to have consisted of wild tulips. However, of the 14 tulip species known from Turkey, only four are considered to be of local origin,[35] so wild tulips from Iran and Central Asia may have been brought into Turkey during the Seljuk and especially Ottoman periods. Also, Sultan Ahmet imported domestic tulip bulbs from the Netherlands.\n\n\nThe gardening book *Revnak'ı Bostan* (Beauty of the Garden) by Sahibül Reis ülhaç Ibrahim Ibn ülhaç Mehmet, written in 1660 does not mention the tulip at all, but contains advice on growing hyacinths and lilies.[36] However, there is considerable confusion of terminology, and tulips may have been subsumed under hyacinth, a mistake several European botanists were to perpetuate. In 1515, the scholar Qasim from Herat in contrast had identified both wild and garden tulips (lale) as anemones (*shaqayq al-nu'man*), but described the crown imperial as *laleh kakli*.[36]\n\n\nIn a Turkic text written before 1495, the Chagatay Husayn Bayqarah mentions tulips (*lale*).[37] Babur, the founder of the Mughal Empire, also names tulips in the Baburnama.[38] He may actually have introduced them from Afghanistan to the plains of India, as he did with other plants like melons and grapes.[39] The tulip represents the official symbol of Turkey.[40]\n\n\nIn Moorish Andalus, a \"Makedonian bulb\" (*basal al-maqdunis*) or \"bucket-Narcissus\" (*naryis qadusi*) was cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens. It was supposed to have come from Alexandria and may have been Tulipa sylvestris, but the identification is not wholly secure.[41]\n\n\n\n#### Introduction to Western Europe[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Tulip cultivation in the Netherlands\n![](image)The Keukenhof in Lisse, Netherlands\nAlthough it is unknown who first brought the tulip to Northwestern Europe, the most widely accepted story is that it was Oghier Ghislain de Busbecq, an ambassador for Emperor Ferdinand I to Suleyman the Magnificent. According to a letter, he saw \"an abundance of flowers everywhere; Narcissus, hyacinths and those in Turkish called Lale, much to our astonishment because it was almost midwinter, a season unfriendly to flowers.\"[42][43] However, in 1559, an account by Conrad Gessner describes tulips flowering in Augsburg, Swabia in the garden of Councillor Heinrich Herwart.[44] In Central and Northern Europe, tulip bulbs are generally removed from the ground in June and must be replanted by September for the winter.[*citation needed*] It is doubtful that Busbecq could have had the tulip bulbs harvested, shipped to Germany and replanted between March 1558 and Gessner's description the following year. Pietro Andrea Mattioli illustrated a tulip in 1565 but identified it as a narcissus.\n\n\nCarolus Clusius is largely responsible for the spread of tulip bulbs in the final years of the 16th century; he planted tulips at the Vienna Imperial Botanical Gardens in 1573. He finished the first major work on tulips in 1592 and made note of the colour variations. After he was appointed the director of the Leiden University's newly established Hortus Botanicus, he planted both a teaching garden and his private garden with tulips in late 1593. Thus, 1594 is considered the date of the tulip's first flowering in the Netherlands, despite reports of the cultivation of tulips in private gardens in Antwerp and Amsterdam two or three decades earlier. These tulips at Leiden would eventually lead to both the tulip mania and the tulip industry in the Netherlands.[45] Over two raids, in 1596 and in 1598, more than one hundred bulbs were stolen from his garden.\n\n\nTulips spread rapidly across Europe, and more opulent varieties such as double tulips were already known in Europe by the early 17th century. These curiosities fitted well in an age when natural oddities were cherished especially in the Netherlands, France, Germany and England, where the spice trade with the East Indies had made many people wealthy. *Nouveaux riches* seeking wealthy displays embraced the exotic plant market, especially in the Low Countries where gardens had become fashionable. A craze for bulbs soon grew in France, where in the early 17th century, entire properties were exchanged as payment for a single tulip bulb. The value of the flower gave it an aura of mystique, and numerous publications describing varieties in lavish garden manuals were published, cashing in on the value of the flower. An export business was built up in France, supplying Dutch, Flemish, German and English buyers. The trade drifted slowly from the French to the Dutch.[46]\n\n\nBetween 1634 and 1637, the enthusiasm for the new flowers in Holland triggered a speculative frenzy now known as the tulip mania that eventually led to the collapse of the market three years later. Tulip bulbs had become so expensive that they were treated as a form of currency, or rather, as futures, forcing the Dutch government to introduce trading restrictions on the bulbs.[46] Around this time, the ceramic tulipiere was devised for the display of cut flowers stem by stem. Vases and bouquets, usually including tulips, often appeared in Dutch still-life painting. To this day, tulips are associated with the Netherlands, and the cultivated forms of the tulip are often called \"Dutch tulips\". The Netherlands has the world's largest permanent display of tulips at the Keukenhof.\n\n\nThe majority of tulip cultivars are classified in the taxon *Tulipa ×gesneriana*. They have usually several species in their direct background, but most have been derived from *Tulipa suaveolens* (today often regarded as a synonym with *Tulipa schrenkii*). *Tulipa ×gesneriana* is in itself an early hybrid of complex origin and is probably not the same taxon as was described by Conrad Gessner in the 16th century.[6]\n\n\nThe UK's National Collection of English florists' tulips and Dutch historic tulips, dating from the early 17th century to c.1960, is held by Polly Nicholson at Blackland House, near Calne in Wiltshire.[47]\n\n\n\n#### Introduction to the United States[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Dallas Arboretum and Botanical Garden\nIt is believed the first tulips in the United States were grown near Spring Pond at the Fay Estate in Lynn and Salem, Massachusetts. From 1847 to 1865, Richard Sullivan Fay, Esq., one of Lynn's wealthiest men, settled on 500 acres (2 km2; 202 ha) located partly in present-day Lynn and partly in present-day Salem. Mr. Fay imported many different trees and plants from all parts of the world and planted them among the meadows of the Fay Estate.[48]\n\n\n\n### Propagation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nTulip pistil surrounded by stamens\n![](image)\nTulip stamen with pollen grains\nThe reproductive organs of a tulip\n\nThe Netherlands is the world's main producer of commercial tulip plants, producing as many as 3 billion bulbs annually, the majority for export.[49]\n\n\n\"Unlike many flower species, tulips do not produce nectar to entice insect pollination. Instead, tulips rely on wind and land animals to move their pollen between reproductive organs. Because they are self-pollinating, they do not need the pollen to move several feet to another plant but only within their blossoms.\"[50]\n\n\nTulips can be propagated through bulb offsets, seeds or micropropagation.[51] Offsets and tissue culture methods are means of asexual propagation for producing genetic clones of the parent plant, which maintains cultivar genetic integrity. Seeds are most often used to propagate species and subspecies or to create new hybrids. Many tulip species can cross-pollinate with each other, and when wild tulip populations overlap geographically with other tulip species or subspecies, they often hybridise and create mixed populations. Most commercial tulip cultivars are complex hybrids, and often sterile.\n\n\nOffsets require a year or more of growth before plants are large enough to flower. Tulips grown from seeds often need five to eight years before plants are of flowering size. To prevent cross-pollination, increase the growth rate of bulbs and increase the vigour and size of offsets, the flower and stems of a field of commercial tulips are usually topped using large tractor-mounted mowing heads. The same goals can be achieved by a private gardener by clipping the stem and flower of an individual specimen. Commercial growers usually harvest the tulip bulbs in late summer and grade them into sizes; bulbs large enough to flower are sorted and sold, while smaller bulbs are sorted into sizes and replanted for sale in the future.\n\n\nBecause tulip bulbs don't reliably come back every year, tulip varieties that fall out of favour with present aesthetic values have traditionally gone extinct. Unlike other flowers that do not suffer this same limitation, the Tulip's historical forms do not survive alongside their modern incarnations.[3]\n\n\n\n### Horticultural classification[edit]\n\n\n![](image)'Gavota', a division 3 cultivar\n![](image)'Yonina', a division 6 cultivar\n![](image)'Texas Flame', a division 10 cultivar\nIn horticulture, tulips are divided into fifteen groups (Divisions) mostly based on flower morphology and plant size.[52][53]\n\n\n\n* **Div. 1: Single early** – with cup-shaped single flowers, no larger than 8 cm (3 inches) across. They bloom early to mid-season. Growing 15 to 45 cm (6 to 18 inches) tall.\n* **Div. 2: Double early** – with fully double flowers, bowl shaped to 8 cm (3 inches) across. Plants typically grow from 30–40 cm (12–16 inches) tall.\n* **Div. 3: Triumph** – single, cup shaped flowers up to 6 cm (2.5 inches) wide. Plants grow 35–60 cm (14–24 inches) tall and bloom mid to late season.\n* **Div. 4: Darwin hybrid** – single flowers are ovoid in shape and up to 6 cm (2.5 inches) wide. Plants grow 50–70 cm (20–28 inches) tall and bloom mid to late season. This group should not be confused with older Darwin tulips, which belong in the Single Late Group below.\n* **Div. 5: Single late** – cup or goblet-shaped flowers up to 8 cm (3 inches) wide, some plants produce multi-flowering stems. Plants grow 45–75 cm (18–30 inches) tall and bloom late season.\n* **Div. 6: Lily-flowered** – the flowers possess a distinct narrow 'waist' with pointed and reflexed petals. Previously included with the old Darwins, only became a group in their own right in 1958.[54]\n* **Div. 7: Fringed (Crispa)** – cup or goblet-shaped blossoms edged with spiked or crystal-like fringes, sometimes called “tulips for touch” because of the temptation to “test” the fringes to see if they are real or made of glass. Perennials with a tendency to naturalize in woodland areas, growing 45–65 cm (18–26 inches) tall and blooming in late season.\n* **Div. 8: Viridiflora**\n* **Div. 9: Rembrandt**\n* **Div. 10: Parrot**\n* **Div. 11: Double late** – Large, heavy blooms. They range from 46 to 56 cm (18 to 22 inches) tall.\n* **Div. 12: Kaufmanniana** – Waterlily tulip. Medium-large creamy yellow flowers marked red on the outside and yellow at the centre. Stems 15 cm (6 inches) tall.\n* **Div. 13: Fosteriana (Emperor)**\n* **Div. 14: Greigii** – Scarlet flowers 15 cm (6 inches) across, on 15-centimetre (6 in) stems. Foliage mottled with brown.[55]\n* **Div. 15: Species or Botanical** – The terms \"species tulips\" and \"botanical tulips\" refer to wild species in contrast to hybridised varieties.[56] As a group they have been described as being less ostentatious but more reliably vigorous as they age.[57][58]\n* **Div. 16: Multiflowering** – not an official division, these tulips belong in the first 15 divisions but are often listed separately because they have multiple blooms per bulb.\n\n\nThey may also be classified by their flowering season:[59]\n\n\n\n* Early flowering: Single Early Tulips, Double Early Tulips, Greigii Tulips, Kaufmanniana Tulips, Fosteriana Tulips, § Species tulips\n* Mid-season flowering: Darwin Hybrid Tulips, Triumph Tulips, Parrot Tulips\n* Late season flowering: Single Late Tulips, Double Late Tulips, Viridiflora Tulips, Lily-flowering Tulips, Fringed (Crispa) Tulips, Rembrandt Tulips\n\n\n#### Neo-tulipae[edit]\n\n\n![Tulip Bulb Depth](image)Tulip bulb planting depth 15 cm (6 inches)\nA number of names are based on naturalised garden tulips and are usually referred to as neo-tulipae. These are often difficult to trace back to their original cultivar, and in some cases have been occurring in the wild for many centuries. The history of naturalisation is unknown, but populations are usually associated with agricultural practices and are possibly linked to saffron cultivation[*clarification needed*]. Some neo-tulipae have been brought into cultivation, and are often offered as botanical tulips. These cultivated plants can be classified into two Cultivar Groups: 'Grengiolensis Group', with picotee tepals, and the 'Didieri Group' with unicolourous tepals.\n\n\n\n### Horticulture[edit]\n\n\nTulip bulbs are typically planted around late summer and fall, in well-drained soils. Tulips should be planted 10 to 15 cm (4 to 6 inches) apart from each other. The recommended hole depth is 10 to 20 cm (4 to 8 inches) deep and is measured from the top of the bulb to the surface. Therefore, larger tulip bulbs would require deeper holes. Species tulips are normally planted deeper.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Culture and politics[edit]\n\n\n### Iran[edit]\n\n\nThe celebration of Persian New Year, or Nowruz, dating back over 3,000 years, marks the advent of spring, and tulips are used as a decorative feature during the festivities.[60]\n\n\nA sixth-century legend, similar to the tale of *Romeo and Juliet*, tells of tulips sprouting where the blood of the young prince Farhad spilt after he killed himself upon hearing the (deliberately false) story that his true love had died.[60]\n\n\nThe tulip was a topic for Persian poets from the thirteenth century. The poem *Gulistan* by Musharrifu'd-din Saadi, described a visionary garden paradise with \"The murmur of a cool stream / bird song, ripe fruit in plenty / bright multicoloured tulips and fragrant roses...\".[61] In recent times, tulips have featured in the poems of Simin Behbahani.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe tulip is the national symbol for martyrdom in Iran[62] (and Shi'ite Islam generally), and has been used on postage stamps and coins. It was common as a symbol used in the 1979 Islamic Revolution, and a red tulip adorns the flag redesigned in 1980. The sword in the centre, with four crescent-shaped petals around it, create the word \"Allah\" as well as symbolising the five pillars of Islam. The tomb of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini is decorated with 72 stained glass tulips, representing 72 martyrs who died at the Battle of Karbala in 680CE. It was also used as a symbol on billboards celebrating casualties of the 1980–1988 war with Iraq.[60]\n\n\nThe tulip also became a symbol of protest against the Iranian government after the presidential election in June 2009, when millions turned out on the streets to protest the re-election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. After the protests were harshly suppressed, the Iranian Green Movement adopted the tulip as a symbol of their struggle.[60]\n\n\nThe word for tulip in Persian is \"laleh\" (لاله), and this has become popular as a girl's name.[62] The name has been used for commercial enterprises, such as the Laleh International Hotel, as well as public facilities, such as Laleh Park[60] and Laleh Hospital,[63] and the tulip motif remains common in Iranian culture.[60]\n\n\n\n* Iranian 20 rial coin\n* ![Obverse with 22 tulips](image)\n\nObverse with 22 tulips\n* ![Reverse with three tulips](image)\n\nReverse with three tulips\n\n\n### In other countries and cultures[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Turkish Airlines uses a grey tulip emblem on its aircraft\nTulips are called *lale* in Turkish (from the Persian: لاله, romanized: *laleh* from لال *lal* 'red'[64]). When written in Arabic letters, *lale* has the same letters as *Allah*, which is why the flower became a holy symbol. It was also associated with the House of Osman, resulting in tulips being widely used in decorative motifs on tiles, mosques, fabrics, crockery, etc. in the Ottoman Empire.[6] The tulip was seen as a symbol of abundance and indulgence. The era during which the Ottoman Empire was wealthiest is often called the Tulip era or *Lale Devri* in Turkish.\n\n\nTulips became popular garden plants in the east and west, but, whereas the tulip in Turkish culture was a symbol of paradise on earth and had almost a divine status, in the Netherlands it represented the briefness of life.[6]\n\n\nIn Christianity, tulips symbolise passion, belief and love. White tulips represent forgiveness while purple tulips represent royalty, both important aspects of Easter.[*citation needed*] In Calvinism, the five points of the doctrines of grace have been summarized under the acrostic TULIP.[65][66]\n\n\nBy contrast to other flowers such as the coneflower or lotus flower, tulips have historically been capable of genetically reinventing themselves to suit changes in aesthetic values. In his 1597 herbal, John Gerard says of the tulip that \"nature seems to play more with this flower than with any other that I do know\". When in the Netherlands, beauty was defined by marbled swirls of vivid contrasting colours, the petals of tulips were able to become \"feathered\" and \"flamed\". However, in the 19th century, when the English desired tulips for carpet bedding and massing, the tulips were able to once again accommodate this by evolving into \"paint-filled boxes with the brightest, fattest dabs of pure pigment\". This inherent mutability of the tulip even led the Ottoman Turks to believe that nature cherished this flower above all others.[3]\n\n\n*The Black Tulip* (1850) is a historical romance by Alexandre Dumas, père. The story takes place in the Dutch city of Haarlem, where a reward is offered to the first grower who can produce a truly black tulip.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe tulip occurs on a number of the Major Arcana cards of occultist Oswald Wirth's deck of Tarot cards, specifically the Magician, Emperor, Temperance and the Fool, described in his 1927 work *Le Tarot, des Imagiers du Moyen Âge*.[67][68]\n\n\n\n### Tulip festivals[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

There is also a popular festival in Morges, Switzerland. Every spring, there are tulip festivals in North America, including the Tulip Time Festival in Holland, Michigan, the Skagit Valley Tulip Festival in Skagit Valley, Washington, the Tulip Time Festival in Orange City and Pella, Iowa, and the Canadian Tulip Festival in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Tulips are also popular in Australia and several festivals are held in September and October, during the Southern Hemisphere's spring. The Indira Gandhi Memorial Tulip Garden hosts an annual tulip festival which draws huge attention and has an attendance of over 200,000.\n\n\n\n## Consumption[edit]\n\n\nTulip petals are edible. The taste varies by variety and season, and is roughly similar to lettuce or other salad greens. Some people are allergic to tulips.[70][71]\n\n\nTulip bulbs look similar to onions, but should not generally be considered food. The toxicity of bulbs is not well understood, nor is there an agreed-upon method of safely preparing them for human consumption. There have been reports of illness when eaten, depending on quantity.[72] During the Dutch famine of 1944–45, tulip bulbs were eaten out of desperation, and Dutch doctors provided recipes.[73][74]\n\n\n\n### Animals[edit]\n\n\nAs with other plants of the lily family, tulips are poisonous to domestic animals including horses, cats and dogs.[13] In cats, ingestion of small amounts of tulips can include vomiting, depression, diarrhoea, hypersalivation, and irritation of the mouth and throat, and larger amounts can cause abdominal pain, tremors, tachycardia, convulsions, tachypnea, difficulty breathing, cardiac arrhythmia, and coma. All parts of the tulip plant are poisonous to cats, while the bulb is especially dangerous. A veterinarian should be contacted immediately if a cat has ingested tulip.[75] In the American East, White-tailed Deer eat tulip flowers ravenously, with no apparent ill effects.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of Award of Garden Merit tulips\n* Tulip period\n\n\n## Explanatory notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Illustration of *Tulipa sylvestris* subsp. *australis*, identified as Tulipa breyniana\n\n## Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"*Tulipa* L\". *Plants of the World Online*.

Their flowers are usually large, showy, and brightly coloured, generally red, orange, pink, yellow, or white (usually in warm colours). They often have a different coloured blotch at the base of the tepals (petals and sepals, collectively), internally. Because of a degree of variability within the populations and a long history of cultivation, classification has been complex and controversial. The tulip is a member of the lily family, Liliaceae,[1] along with 14 other genera, where it is most closely related to *Amana*, *Erythronium*, and *Gagea* in the tribe Lilieae. \n\n\nThere are about seventy-five species, and these are divided among four subgenera. The name \"tulip\" is thought to be derived from a Persian word for turban, which it may have been thought to resemble by those who discovered it. Tulips were originally found in a band stretching from Southern Europe to Central Asia, but since the seventeenth century have become widely naturalised and cultivated (*see map*). In their natural state, they are adapted to steppes and mountainous areas with temperate climates. Flowering in the spring, they become dormant in the summer once the flowers and leaves die back, emerging above ground as a shoot from the underground bulb in early spring.\n\n\nGrowing wild over much of the Near East and Central Asia, tulips had probably been cultivated in Persia from the 10th century. By the 15th century, tulips were among the most prized flowers; becoming the symbol of the later Ottomans. Tulips were cultivated in Byzantine Constantinople as early as 1055 but they did not come to the attention of Northern Europeans until the sixteenth century, when Northern European diplomats to the Ottoman court observed and reported on them.[2] They were rapidly introduced into Northern Europe and became a much-sought-after commodity during tulip mania. Tulips were frequently depicted in Dutch Golden Age paintings, and have become associated with the Netherlands, the major producer for world markets, ever since. In the seventeenth-century Netherlands, during the time of the tulip mania, an infection of tulip bulbs by the tulip breaking virus created variegated patterns in the tulip flowers that were much admired and valued. While truly broken tulips are not cultivated anymore, the closest available specimens today are part of the group known as the Rembrandts – so named because Rembrandt painted some of the most admired breaks of his time.[3]\n\n\nBreeding programmes have produced thousands of hybrid and cultivars in addition to the original species (known in horticulture as botanical tulips). They are popular throughout the world, both as ornamental garden plants and as cut flowers.\n\n\n\n\n## Description[edit]\n\n\nTulip morphology\n![Collection of tulip bulbs, some sliced to show interior scales](image)\n**Bulbs**, showing tunic and scales\n![Flower of Tulipa orphanidea, showing cup shape](image)\nCup-shaped flower of *Tulipa orphanidea*\n![Photograph of Tulipa clusiana, showing six identical tepals (petals and sepals)](image)\nStar-shaped flower of *Tulipa clusiana* with three sepals and three petals, forming six identical tepals\n\nTulips are perennial herbaceous bulbiferous geophytes that bloom in spring and die back after flowering to an underground storage bulb. Depending on the species, tulip plants can be between 10 and 70 cm (4 and 28 inches) high.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nTulip stems have few leaves. Larger species tend to have multiple leaves. Plants typically have two to six leaves, some species up to 12. The tulip's leaf is cauline (born on a stem), strap-shaped, with a waxy coating, and the leaves are alternate (alternately arranged on the stem), diminishing in size the further up the stem. These fleshy blades are often bluish-green in colour.[4][5][6] The bulbs are truncated basally and elongated towards the apex. They are covered by a protective tunic (tunicate) which can be glabrous or hairy inside.[7][6]\n\n\n\n### Flowers[edit]\n\n\nThe tulip's flowers are usually large and are actinomorphic (radially symmetric) and hermaphrodite (contain both male (androecium) and female (gynoecium) characteristics), generally erect, or more rarely pendulous, and are arranged more usually as a single terminal flower, or when pluriflor as two to three (e.g. *Tulipa turkestanica*), but up to four, flowers on the end of a floriferous stem (scape), which is single arising from amongst the basal leaf rosette. In structure, the flower is generally cup or star-shaped. As with other members of Liliaceae the perianth is undifferentiated (perigonium) and biseriate (two whorled), formed from six free (i.e. apotepalous) caducous tepals arranged into two separate whorls of three parts (trimerous) each. The two whorls represent three petals and three sepals, but are termed tepals because they are nearly identical. The tepals are usually petaloid (petal-like), being brightly coloured, but each whorl may be different, or have different coloured blotches at their bases, forming darker colouration on the interior surface. The inner petals have a small, delicate cleft at the top, while the sturdier outer ones form uninterrupted ovals.[3]\n\n\nThe flowers have six distinct, basifixed introrse stamens arranged in two whorls of three, which vary in length and may be glabrous or hairy. The filaments are shorter than the tepals and dilated towards their base.[7] The style is short or absent and each stigma has three distinct lobes, and the ovaries are superior, with three chambers.[7]\n\n\n\n#### Colours[edit]\n\n\nThe \"Semper Augustus\" was the most expensive tulip during the 17th-century tulip mania. “The colour is white, with Carmine on a blue base, and with an unbroken flame right to the top” – wrote Nicolas van Wassenaer in 1624 after seeing the tulip in the garden of one Dr Adriaen Pauw, a director of the new East India Company. With limited specimens in existence at the time and most owned by Pauw, his refusal to sell any flowers, despite wildly escalating offers, is believed by some to have sparked the mania.[3]\n\n\nTulip flowers come in a wide variety of colours, except pure blue (several tulips with \"blue\" in the name have a faint violet hue), and have absent nectaries.[4][5][6][7] Tulip flowers are generally bereft of scent and are the coolest of floral characters. The Dutch regarded this lack of scent as a virtue, as it demonstrates the flower's chasteness.[3]\n\n\nWhile tulips can be bred to display a wide variety of colours, black tulips have historically been difficult to achieve. The Queen of the Night tulip is as close to black as a flower gets, though it is, in fact, a dark and glossy maroonish purple - nonetheless, an effect prized by the Dutch.[3] The first truly black tulip was bred in 1986 by a Dutch flower grower in Bovenkarspel, Netherlands. The specimen was created by cross-breeding two deep purple tulips, the Queen of the Night and Wienerwald tulips.[8]\n\n\n\n### Fruit[edit]\n\n\nThe tulip's fruit is a globose or ellipsoid capsule with a leathery covering and an ellipsoid to globe shape. Each capsule contains numerous flat, disc-shaped seeds in two rows per chamber.[9] These light to dark brown seeds have very thin seed coats and endosperm that do not normally fill the entire seed.[10][7]\n\n\n\n### Phytochemistry[edit]\n\n\nTulipanin is an anthocyanin found in tulips. It is the 3-rutinoside of delphinidin. The chemical compounds named tuliposides and tulipalins can also be found in tulips and are responsible for allergies.[11] Tulipalin A, or α-methylene-γ-butyrolactone, is a common allergen, generated by hydrolysis of the glucoside tuliposide A. It induces a dermatitis that is mostly occupational and affects tulip bulb sorters and florists who cut the stems and leaves.[12] Tulipanin A and B are toxic to horses, cats and dogs.[13] The colour of a tulip is formed from two pigments working in concert; a base colour that is always yellow or white, and a second laid-on anthocyanin colour. The mix of these two hues determines the visible unitary colour. The breaking of flowers occurs when a virus suppresses anthocyanin and the base colour is exposed as a streak.[3]\n\n\n\n### Fragrance[edit]\n\n\nThe great majority of tulips, both species and cultivars, have no discernable scent, but a few of both are scented to a degree, and Anna Pavord describes *T. Hungarica* as \"strongly scented\",[14] and among cultivars, some such as \"Monte Carlo\" and \"Brown Sugar\" are \"scented\", and \"Creme Upstar\" \"fragrant\".[15]\n\n\n\n## Taxonomy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Taxonomy of Tulipa\n\n*Tulipa* is a genus of the lily family, Liliaceae, once one of the largest families of monocots, but which molecular phylogenetics has reduced to a monophyletic grouping with only 15 genera. Within Liliaceae, *Tulipa* is placed within Lilioideae, one of three subfamilies, with two tribes. Tribe Lilieae includes seven other genera in addition to *Tulipa*.\n\n\n\n### Subdivision[edit]\n\n\nThe genus, which includes about 75 species, is divided into four subgenera.[6]\n\n\n\n* *Clusianae* (4 species)\n* *Orithyia* (4 species)\n* *Tulipa* (52 species)\n* *Eriostemones* (16 species)\n\n\n### Etymology[edit]\n\n\nThe word *tulip*, first mentioned in western Europe in or around 1554 and seemingly derived from the \"Turkish Letters\" of diplomat Ogier Ghiselin de Busbecq, first appeared in English as *tulipa* or *tulipant*, entering the language by way of French: *tulipe* and its obsolete form *tulipan* or by way of Modern Latin *tulipa*, from Ottoman Turkish *tülbend* (\"muslin\" or \"gauze\"), and may be ultimately derived from the Persian: دلبند *delband* (\"Turban\"), this name being applied because of a perceived resemblance of the shape of a tulip flower to that of a turban.[16] This may have been due to a translation error in early times when it was fashionable in the Ottoman Empire to wear tulips on turbans. The translator possibly confused the flower for the turban.[6]\n\n\nOgier Ghiselin de Busbecq stated that the \"Turks\" used the word *tulipan* to describe the flower. Extensive speculation has tried to understand why he would state this, given that the Turkish word for tulip is *lale*. It is from this speculation that *tulipan* being a translation error referring to turbans is derived. This etymology has been challenged and makes no assumptions about possible errors. At no point does Busbecq state this was the word used in Turkey, he simply states it was used by the \"Turks\". On his way to Constantinople Busbecq states he travelled through Hungary and used Hungarian guides. Until recent times \"Turk\" was a common term when referring to Hungarians. The word *tulipan* is in fact the Hungarian word for tulip. As long as one recognizes \"Turk\" as a reference to Hungarians, no amount of speculation is required to reconcile the word's origin or form. Busbecq may have been simply repeating the word used by his \"Turk/Hungarian\" guides.[17]\n\n\nThe Hungarian word *tulipan* may be adopted from an Indo-Aryan reference to the tulip as a symbol of resurrection, *tala* meaning \"bottom or underworld\" and *pAna* meaning \"defence\".[17] Prior to arriving in Europe the Hungarians, and other Finno-Ugrians, embraced the Indo-Iranian cult of the dead, Yima/Yama, and would have been familiar with all of its symbols including the tulip.[18]\n\n\n\n## Distribution and habitat[edit]\n\n\n![Map from Turkmenistan to Tien-Shan](image)Eastern end of the tulip range from Turkmenistan on the eastern shore of the Caspian Sea to the Pamir-Alai and Tien-Shan mountains\nTulips are mainly distributed along a band corresponding to latitude 40° north, from southeast of Europe (Greece, Albania, North Macedonia, Kosovo, Southern Serbia, Bulgaria, most part of Romania, Ukraine, Russia) and Turkey in the west, through the Levant (Syria, Israel, Palestinian Territories, Lebanon and Jordan) and the Sinai Peninsula. From there it extends eastwards through Jerevan (Armenia), and Baku (Azerbaijan) and on the eastern shore of the Caspian Sea through Turkmenistan, Bukhara, Samarkand and Tashkent (Uzbekistan), to the eastern end of the range in the Pamir-Alai and Tien-Shan mountains in Central Asia, which form the centre of diversity.[19] Further to the east, *Tulipa* is found in the western Himalayas, southern Siberia, Inner Mongolia, and as far as the northwest of China. While authorities have stated that no tulips west of the Balkans are native,[20] subsequent identification of *Tulipa sylvestris* subsp. *australis* as a native of the Iberian peninsula and adjacent North Africa shows that this may be a simplification. In addition to these regions in the west tulips have been identified in Greece, Cyprus and the Balkans. In the south, Iran marks its furthest extent, while the northern limit is Ukraine.[21] Although tulips are also throughout most of the Mediterranean and Europe, these regions do not form part of the natural distribution. Tulips were brought to Europe by travellers and merchants from Anatolia and Central Asia for cultivation, from where they escaped and naturalised (*see map*). For instance, less than half of those species found in Turkey are actually native.[20] These have been referred to as neo-tulipae.[22][23][6]\n\n\nTulips are indigenous to mountainous areas with temperate climates, where they are a common element of steppe and winter-rain Mediterranean vegetation. They thrive in climates with long, cool springs and dry summers. Tulips are most commonly found in meadows, steppes and chaparral, but also introduced in fields, orchards, roadsides and abandoned gardens.[22][6]\n\n\n\n## Ecology[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Variegation produced by the tulip breaking virus\n*Botrytis tulipae* is a major fungal disease affecting tulips, causing cell death and eventually the rotting of the plant.[24] Other pathogens include anthracnose, bacterial soft rot, blight caused by *Sclerotium rolfsii*, bulb nematodes, other rots including blue molds, black molds and mushy rot.[25]\n\n\nThe fungus *Trichoderma viride* can infect tulips, producing dried leaf tips and reduced growth, although symptoms are usually mild and only present on bulbs growing in glasshouses.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nVariegated tulips admired during the Dutch tulipomania gained their delicately feathered patterns from an infection with the tulip breaking virus, a mosaic virus that was carried by the green peach aphid, *Myzus persicae*. While the virus produces fantastically streaked flowers, it also weakens plants and reduces the number of offsets produced. Dutch growers would go to extraordinary lengths during tulipomania to make tulips break, borrowing alchemists’ techniques and resorting to sprinkling paint powders of the desired hue or pigeon droppings onto flower roots.[3]\n\n\nTulips affected by the mosaic virus are called \"broken\"; while such plants can occasionally revert to a plain or solid colouring, they will remain infected and have to be destroyed. Today the virus is almost eradicated from tulip growers' fields. The multicoloured patterns of modern varieties result from breeding; they normally have solid, un-feathered borders between the colours.\n\n\nTulip growth is also dependent on temperature conditions. Slightly germinated plants show greater growth if subjected to a period of cool dormancy, known as vernalisation. Furthermore, although flower development is induced at warmer temperatures (20–25 °C or 68–77 °F), elongation of the flower stalk and proper flowering is dependent on an extended period of low temperature (< 10 °C or 50 °F).[26] Tulip bulbs imported to warm-winter areas are often planted in autumn to be treated as annuals.\n\n\nThe colour of tulip flowers also varies with growing conditions.[27]\n\n\n\n## Cultivation[edit]\n\n\n### History[edit]\n\n\n#### Islamic World[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*Tulipa sylvestris* subsp. *australis*[a] with seedpod by Sydenham Edwards (1804)[28]\nCultivation of the tulip began in Iran (Persia), probably in the 10th century.[6] Early cultivars must have emerged from hybridisation in gardens from wild collected plants, which were then favoured, possibly due to flower size or growth vigour. The tulip is not mentioned by any writer from antiquity,[29] therefore it seems probable that tulips were introduced into Anatolia only with the advance of the Seljuks.[29] In the Ottoman Empire, numerous types of tulips were cultivated and bred,[30] and today, 14 species can still be found in Turkey.[29] Tulips are mentioned by Omar Kayam and Jalāl ad-Dīn Rûmi.[29] Species of tulips in Turkey typically come in red, less commonly in white or yellow. The Ottoman Turks had discovered that these wild tulips were great changelings, freely hybridizing (though it takes 7 years to show colour) but also subject to mutations that produced spontaneous changes in form and colour.[3]\n\n\nA paper by Arthur Baker[31] reports that in 1574, Sultan Selim II ordered the Kadi of A‘azāz in Syria to send him 50,000 tulip bulbs. However, John Harvey[32] points out several problems with this source, and there is also the possibility that tulips and hyacinth (*sümbüll*), originally Indian spikenard (*Nardostachys jatamansi*) have been confused. Sultan Selim also imported 300,000 bulbs of *Kefe Lale* (also known as Cafe-Lale, from the medieval name Kaffa, probably *Tulipa schrenkii*) from Kefe in Crimea, for his gardens in the Topkapı Sarayı in Istanbul.[33]\n\n\nIt is also reported that shortly after arriving in Constantinople in 1554, Ogier Ghislain de Busbecq, ambassador of the Austrian Habsburgs to the court of Suleyman the Magnificent, claimed to have introduced the tulip to Europe by sending a consignment of bulbs west. The fact that the tulip's first official trip west took it from one court to the other could have contributed to its ascendency.[3]\n\n\nSultan Ahmet III maintained famous tulip gardens in the summer highland pastures (*Yayla*) at Spil Dağı above the town of Manisa.[34] They seem to have consisted of wild tulips. However, of the 14 tulip species known from Turkey, only four are considered to be of local origin,[35] so wild tulips from Iran and Central Asia may have been brought into Turkey during the Seljuk and especially Ottoman periods. Also, Sultan Ahmet imported domestic tulip bulbs from the Netherlands.\n\n\nThe gardening book *Revnak'ı Bostan* (Beauty of the Garden) by Sahibül Reis ülhaç Ibrahim Ibn ülhaç Mehmet, written in 1660 does not mention the tulip at all, but contains advice on growing hyacinths and lilies.[36] However, there is considerable confusion of terminology, and tulips may have been subsumed under hyacinth, a mistake several European botanists were to perpetuate. In 1515, the scholar Qasim from Herat in contrast had identified both wild and garden tulips (lale) as anemones (*shaqayq al-nu'man*), but described the crown imperial as *laleh kakli*.[36]\n\n\nIn a Turkic text written before 1495, the Chagatay Husayn Bayqarah mentions tulips (*lale*).[37] Babur, the founder of the Mughal Empire, also names tulips in the Baburnama.[38] He may actually have introduced them from Afghanistan to the plains of India, as he did with other plants like melons and grapes.[39] The tulip represents the official symbol of Turkey.[40]\n\n\nIn Moorish Andalus, a \"Makedonian bulb\" (*basal al-maqdunis*) or \"bucket-Narcissus\" (*naryis qadusi*) was cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens. It was supposed to have come from Alexandria and may have been Tulipa sylvestris, but the identification is not wholly secure.[41]\n\n\n\n#### Introduction to Western Europe[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Tulip cultivation in the Netherlands\n![](image)The Keukenhof in Lisse, Netherlands\nAlthough it is unknown who first brought the tulip to Northwestern Europe, the most widely accepted story is that it was Oghier Ghislain de Busbecq, an ambassador for Emperor Ferdinand I to Suleyman the Magnificent. According to a letter, he saw \"an abundance of flowers everywhere; Narcissus, hyacinths and those in Turkish called Lale, much to our astonishment because it was almost midwinter, a season unfriendly to flowers.\"[42][43] However, in 1559, an account by Conrad Gessner describes tulips flowering in Augsburg, Swabia in the garden of Councillor Heinrich Herwart.[44] In Central and Northern Europe, tulip bulbs are generally removed from the ground in June and must be replanted by September for the winter.[*citation needed*] It is doubtful that Busbecq could have had the tulip bulbs harvested, shipped to Germany and replanted between March 1558 and Gessner's description the following year. Pietro Andrea Mattioli illustrated a tulip in 1565 but identified it as a narcissus.\n\n\nCarolus Clusius is largely responsible for the spread of tulip bulbs in the final years of the 16th century; he planted tulips at the Vienna Imperial Botanical Gardens in 1573. He finished the first major work on tulips in 1592 and made note of the colour variations. After he was appointed the director of the Leiden University's newly established Hortus Botanicus, he planted both a teaching garden and his private garden with tulips in late 1593. Thus, 1594 is considered the date of the tulip's first flowering in the Netherlands, despite reports of the cultivation of tulips in private gardens in Antwerp and Amsterdam two or three decades earlier. These tulips at Leiden would eventually lead to both the tulip mania and the tulip industry in the Netherlands.[45] Over two raids, in 1596 and in 1598, more than one hundred bulbs were stolen from his garden.\n\n\nTulips spread rapidly across Europe, and more opulent varieties such as double tulips were already known in Europe by the early 17th century. These curiosities fitted well in an age when natural oddities were cherished especially in the Netherlands, France, Germany and England, where the spice trade with the East Indies had made many people wealthy. *Nouveaux riches* seeking wealthy displays embraced the exotic plant market, especially in the Low Countries where gardens had become fashionable. A craze for bulbs soon grew in France, where in the early 17th century, entire properties were exchanged as payment for a single tulip bulb. The value of the flower gave it an aura of mystique, and numerous publications describing varieties in lavish garden manuals were published, cashing in on the value of the flower. An export business was built up in France, supplying Dutch, Flemish, German and English buyers. The trade drifted slowly from the French to the Dutch.[46]\n\n\nBetween 1634 and 1637, the enthusiasm for the new flowers in Holland triggered a speculative frenzy now known as the tulip mania that eventually led to the collapse of the market three years later. Tulip bulbs had become so expensive that they were treated as a form of currency, or rather, as futures, forcing the Dutch government to introduce trading restrictions on the bulbs.[46] Around this time, the ceramic tulipiere was devised for the display of cut flowers stem by stem. Vases and bouquets, usually including tulips, often appeared in Dutch still-life painting. To this day, tulips are associated with the Netherlands, and the cultivated forms of the tulip are often called \"Dutch tulips\". The Netherlands has the world's largest permanent display of tulips at the Keukenhof.\n\n\nThe majority of tulip cultivars are classified in the taxon *Tulipa ×gesneriana*. They have usually several species in their direct background, but most have been derived from *Tulipa suaveolens* (today often regarded as a synonym with *Tulipa schrenkii*). *Tulipa ×gesneriana* is in itself an early hybrid of complex origin and is probably not the same taxon as was described by Conrad Gessner in the 16th century.[6]\n\n\nThe UK's National Collection of English florists' tulips and Dutch historic tulips, dating from the early 17th century to c.1960, is held by Polly Nicholson at Blackland House, near Calne in Wiltshire.[47]\n\n\n\n#### Introduction to the United States[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Dallas Arboretum and Botanical Garden\nIt is believed the first tulips in the United States were grown near Spring Pond at the Fay Estate in Lynn and Salem, Massachusetts. From 1847 to 1865, Richard Sullivan Fay, Esq., one of Lynn's wealthiest men, settled on 500 acres (2 km2; 202 ha) located partly in present-day Lynn and partly in present-day Salem. Mr. Fay imported many different trees and plants from all parts of the world and planted them among the meadows of the Fay Estate.[48]\n\n\n\n### Propagation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nTulip pistil surrounded by stamens\n![](image)\nTulip stamen with pollen grains\nThe reproductive organs of a tulip\n\nThe Netherlands is the world's main producer of commercial tulip plants, producing as many as 3 billion bulbs annually, the majority for export.[49]\n\n\n\"Unlike many flower species, tulips do not produce nectar to entice insect pollination. Instead, tulips rely on wind and land animals to move their pollen between reproductive organs. Because they are self-pollinating, they do not need the pollen to move several feet to another plant but only within their blossoms.\"[50]\n\n\nTulips can be propagated through bulb offsets, seeds or micropropagation.[51] Offsets and tissue culture methods are means of asexual propagation for producing genetic clones of the parent plant, which maintains cultivar genetic integrity. Seeds are most often used to propagate species and subspecies or to create new hybrids. Many tulip species can cross-pollinate with each other, and when wild tulip populations overlap geographically with other tulip species or subspecies, they often hybridise and create mixed populations. Most commercial tulip cultivars are complex hybrids, and often sterile.\n\n\nOffsets require a year or more of growth before plants are large enough to flower. Tulips grown from seeds often need five to eight years before plants are of flowering size. To prevent cross-pollination, increase the growth rate of bulbs and increase the vigour and size of offsets, the flower and stems of a field of commercial tulips are usually topped using large tractor-mounted mowing heads. The same goals can be achieved by a private gardener by clipping the stem and flower of an individual specimen. Commercial growers usually harvest the tulip bulbs in late summer and grade them into sizes; bulbs large enough to flower are sorted and sold, while smaller bulbs are sorted into sizes and replanted for sale in the future.\n\n\nBecause tulip bulbs don't reliably come back every year, tulip varieties that fall out of favour with present aesthetic values have traditionally gone extinct. Unlike other flowers that do not suffer this same limitation, the Tulip's historical forms do not survive alongside their modern incarnations.[3]\n\n\n\n### Horticultural classification[edit]\n\n\n![](image)'Gavota', a division 3 cultivar\n![](image)'Yonina', a division 6 cultivar\n![](image)'Texas Flame', a division 10 cultivar\nIn horticulture, tulips are divided into fifteen groups (Divisions) mostly based on flower morphology and plant size.[52][53]\n\n\n\n* **Div. 1: Single early** – with cup-shaped single flowers, no larger than 8 cm (3 inches) across. They bloom early to mid-season. Growing 15 to 45 cm (6 to 18 inches) tall.\n* **Div. 2: Double early** – with fully double flowers, bowl shaped to 8 cm (3 inches) across. Plants typically grow from 30–40 cm (12–16 inches) tall.\n* **Div. 3: Triumph** – single, cup shaped flowers up to 6 cm (2.5 inches) wide. Plants grow 35–60 cm (14–24 inches) tall and bloom mid to late season.\n* **Div. 4: Darwin hybrid** – single flowers are ovoid in shape and up to 6 cm (2.5 inches) wide. Plants grow 50–70 cm (20–28 inches) tall and bloom mid to late season. This group should not be confused with older Darwin tulips, which belong in the Single Late Group below.\n* **Div. 5: Single late** – cup or goblet-shaped flowers up to 8 cm (3 inches) wide, some plants produce multi-flowering stems. Plants grow 45–75 cm (18–30 inches) tall and bloom late season.\n* **Div. 6: Lily-flowered** – the flowers possess a distinct narrow 'waist' with pointed and reflexed petals. Previously included with the old Darwins, only became a group in their own right in 1958.[54]\n* **Div. 7: Fringed (Crispa)** – cup or goblet-shaped blossoms edged with spiked or crystal-like fringes, sometimes called “tulips for touch” because of the temptation to “test” the fringes to see if they are real or made of glass. Perennials with a tendency to naturalize in woodland areas, growing 45–65 cm (18–26 inches) tall and blooming in late season.\n* **Div. 8: Viridiflora**\n* **Div. 9: Rembrandt**\n* **Div. 10: Parrot**\n* **Div. 11: Double late** – Large, heavy blooms. They range from 46 to 56 cm (18 to 22 inches) tall.\n* **Div. 12: Kaufmanniana** – Waterlily tulip. Medium-large creamy yellow flowers marked red on the outside and yellow at the centre. Stems 15 cm (6 inches) tall.\n* **Div. 13: Fosteriana (Emperor)**\n* **Div. 14: Greigii** – Scarlet flowers 15 cm (6 inches) across, on 15-centimetre (6 in) stems. Foliage mottled with brown.[55]\n* **Div. 15: Species or Botanical** – The terms \"species tulips\" and \"botanical tulips\" refer to wild species in contrast to hybridised varieties.[56] As a group they have been described as being less ostentatious but more reliably vigorous as they age.[57][58]\n* **Div. 16: Multiflowering** – not an official division, these tulips belong in the first 15 divisions but are often listed separately because they have multiple blooms per bulb.\n\n\nThey may also be classified by their flowering season:[59]\n\n\n\n* Early flowering: Single Early Tulips, Double Early Tulips, Greigii Tulips, Kaufmanniana Tulips, Fosteriana Tulips, § Species tulips\n* Mid-season flowering: Darwin Hybrid Tulips, Triumph Tulips, Parrot Tulips\n* Late season flowering: Single Late Tulips, Double Late Tulips, Viridiflora Tulips, Lily-flowering Tulips, Fringed (Crispa) Tulips, Rembrandt Tulips\n\n\n#### Neo-tulipae[edit]\n\n\n![Tulip Bulb Depth](image)Tulip bulb planting depth 15 cm (6 inches)\nA number of names are based on naturalised garden tulips and are usually referred to as neo-tulipae. These are often difficult to trace back to their original cultivar, and in some cases have been occurring in the wild for many centuries. The history of naturalisation is unknown, but populations are usually associated with agricultural practices and are possibly linked to saffron cultivation[*clarification needed*]. Some neo-tulipae have been brought into cultivation, and are often offered as botanical tulips. These cultivated plants can be classified into two Cultivar Groups: 'Grengiolensis Group', with picotee tepals, and the 'Didieri Group' with unicolourous tepals.\n\n\n\n### Horticulture[edit]\n\n\nTulip bulbs are typically planted around late summer and fall, in well-drained soils. Tulips should be planted 10 to 15 cm (4 to 6 inches) apart from each other. The recommended hole depth is 10 to 20 cm (4 to 8 inches) deep and is measured from the top of the bulb to the surface. Therefore, larger tulip bulbs would require deeper holes. Species tulips are normally planted deeper.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Culture and politics[edit]\n\n\n### Iran[edit]\n\n\nThe celebration of Persian New Year, or Nowruz, dating back over 3,000 years, marks the advent of spring, and tulips are used as a decorative feature during the festivities.[60]\n\n\nA sixth-century legend, similar to the tale of *Romeo and Juliet*, tells of tulips sprouting where the blood of the young prince Farhad spilt after he killed himself upon hearing the (deliberately false) story that his true love had died.[60]\n\n\nThe tulip was a topic for Persian poets from the thirteenth century. The poem *Gulistan* by Musharrifu'd-din Saadi, described a visionary garden paradise with \"The murmur of a cool stream / bird song, ripe fruit in plenty / bright multicoloured tulips and fragrant roses...\".[61] In recent times, tulips have featured in the poems of Simin Behbahani.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe tulip is the national symbol for martyrdom in Iran[62] (and Shi'ite Islam generally), and has been used on postage stamps and coins. It was common as a symbol used in the 1979 Islamic Revolution, and a red tulip adorns the flag redesigned in 1980. The sword in the centre, with four crescent-shaped petals around it, create the word \"Allah\" as well as symbolising the five pillars of Islam. The tomb of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini is decorated with 72 stained glass tulips, representing 72 martyrs who died at the Battle of Karbala in 680CE. It was also used as a symbol on billboards celebrating casualties of the 1980–1988 war with Iraq.[60]\n\n\nThe tulip also became a symbol of protest against the Iranian government after the presidential election in June 2009, when millions turned out on the streets to protest the re-election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. After the protests were harshly suppressed, the Iranian Green Movement adopted the tulip as a symbol of their struggle.[60]\n\n\nThe word for tulip in Persian is \"laleh\" (لاله), and this has become popular as a girl's name.[62] The name has been used for commercial enterprises, such as the Laleh International Hotel, as well as public facilities, such as Laleh Park[60] and Laleh Hospital,[63] and the tulip motif remains common in Iranian culture.[60]\n\n\n\n* Iranian 20 rial coin\n* ![Obverse with 22 tulips](image)\n\nObverse with 22 tulips\n* ![Reverse with three tulips](image)\n\nReverse with three tulips\n\n\n### In other countries and cultures[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Turkish Airlines uses a grey tulip emblem on its aircraft\nTulips are called *lale* in Turkish (from the Persian: لاله, romanized: *laleh* from لال *lal* 'red'[64]). When written in Arabic letters, *lale* has the same letters as *Allah*, which is why the flower became a holy symbol. It was also associated with the House of Osman, resulting in tulips being widely used in decorative motifs on tiles, mosques, fabrics, crockery, etc. in the Ottoman Empire.[6] The tulip was seen as a symbol of abundance and indulgence. The era during which the Ottoman Empire was wealthiest is often called the Tulip era or *Lale Devri* in Turkish.\n\n\nTulips became popular garden plants in the east and west, but, whereas the tulip in Turkish culture was a symbol of paradise on earth and had almost a divine status, in the Netherlands it represented the briefness of life.[6]\n\n\nIn Christianity, tulips symbolise passion, belief and love. White tulips represent forgiveness while purple tulips represent royalty, both important aspects of Easter.[*citation needed*] In Calvinism, the five points of the doctrines of grace have been summarized under the acrostic TULIP.[65][66]\n\n\nBy contrast to other flowers such as the coneflower or lotus flower, tulips have historically been capable of genetically reinventing themselves to suit changes in aesthetic values. In his 1597 herbal, John Gerard says of the tulip that \"nature seems to play more with this flower than with any other that I do know\". When in the Netherlands, beauty was defined by marbled swirls of vivid contrasting colours, the petals of tulips were able to become \"feathered\" and \"flamed\". However, in the 19th century, when the English desired tulips for carpet bedding and massing, the tulips were able to once again accommodate this by evolving into \"paint-filled boxes with the brightest, fattest dabs of pure pigment\". This inherent mutability of the tulip even led the Ottoman Turks to believe that nature cherished this flower above all others.[3]\n\n\n*The Black Tulip* (1850) is a historical romance by Alexandre Dumas, père. The story takes place in the Dutch city of Haarlem, where a reward is offered to the first grower who can produce a truly black tulip.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe tulip occurs on a number of the Major Arcana cards of occultist Oswald Wirth's deck of Tarot cards, specifically the Magician, Emperor, Temperance and the Fool, described in his 1927 work *Le Tarot, des Imagiers du Moyen Âge*.[67][68]\n\n\n\n### Tulip festivals[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

There is also a popular festival in Morges, Switzerland. Every spring, there are tulip festivals in North America, including the Tulip Time Festival in Holland, Michigan, the Skagit Valley Tulip Festival in Skagit Valley, Washington, the Tulip Time Festival in Orange City and Pella, Iowa, and the Canadian Tulip Festival in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Tulips are also popular in Australia and several festivals are held in September and October, during the Southern Hemisphere's spring. The Indira Gandhi Memorial Tulip Garden hosts an annual tulip festival which draws huge attention and has an attendance of over 200,000.\n\n\n\n## Consumption[edit]\n\n\nTulip petals are edible. The taste varies by variety and season, and is roughly similar to lettuce or other salad greens. Some people are allergic to tulips.[70][71]\n\n\nTulip bulbs look similar to onions, but should not generally be considered food. The toxicity of bulbs is not well understood, nor is there an agreed-upon method of safely preparing them for human consumption. There have been reports of illness when eaten, depending on quantity.[72] During the Dutch famine of 1944–45, tulip bulbs were eaten out of desperation, and Dutch doctors provided recipes.[73][74]\n\n\n\n### Animals[edit]\n\n\nAs with other plants of the lily family, tulips are poisonous to domestic animals including horses, cats and dogs.[13] In cats, ingestion of small amounts of tulips can include vomiting, depression, diarrhoea, hypersalivation, and irritation of the mouth and throat, and larger amounts can cause abdominal pain, tremors, tachycardia, convulsions, tachypnea, difficulty breathing, cardiac arrhythmia, and coma. All parts of the tulip plant are poisonous to cats, while the bulb is especially dangerous. A veterinarian should be contacted immediately if a cat has ingested tulip.[75] In the American East, White-tailed Deer eat tulip flowers ravenously, with no apparent ill effects.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of Award of Garden Merit tulips\n* Tulip period\n\n\n## Explanatory notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Illustration of *Tulipa sylvestris* subsp. *australis*, identified as Tulipa breyniana\n\n## Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"*Tulipa* L\". *Plants of the World Online*.
