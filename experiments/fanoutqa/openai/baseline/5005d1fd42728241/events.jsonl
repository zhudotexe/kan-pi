His stage name was derived from inputting his birth name into a rap name generator.[4]\n\n\nMalone began his musical career in 2011, and gained recognition with his 2015 debut single \"White Iverson\",[5] which peaked at number 14 on the US *Billboard* Hot 100. Malone signed a recording contract with Republic Records[6] to release his debut album *Stoney* (2016); it contained the diamond-certified single \"Congratulations\" (featuring Quavo) and peaked at number four on the *Billboard* 200.[7] His second album, *Beerbongs & Bentleys* (2018), debuted at number one on the *Billboard* 200, also setting numerous streaming records.[7] It contained the *Billboard* Hot 100 number-one singles \"Rockstar\" (featuring 21 Savage) and \"Psycho\" (featuring Ty Dolla Sign), and was nominated for Album of the Year at the 61st Grammy Awards.\n\n\nHis third number one single, \"Sunflower\" (with Swae Lee) was released in promotion for the accompanying soundtrack to the 2018 animated film *Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse*; it became the highest-certified song in RIAA history, receiving 17 platinum plaques. \"Sunflower\" was also included on Malone's third album *Hollywood's Bleeding* (2019), which became his second album to peak the *Billboard* 200[8] and spawned the similarly successful 2020 follow-up single \"Circles\", which was his fourth US number-one song and spent 61 weeks on the Hot 100.[9]\nHis fourth album, *Twelve Carat Toothache* was released in June 2022, spearheaded by the US top-ten singles \"I Like You (A Happier Song)\" (featuring Doja Cat) and \"One Right Now\" (with the Weeknd). His eponymous fifth album (2023) explored pop rock and reached similar success, supported by the lead single \"Chemical\".\n\n\nMalone is among the best-selling music artists with over 80 million records sold.[10] His numerous accolades include ten *Billboard* Music Awards, three American Music Awards, one MTV Video Music Award, and nine Grammy Award nominations.[11] He holds several *Billboard* chart records: He is the first solo lead artist to top both the Rap Airplay and Adult Contemporary charts, while \"Circles\" set the record for longest climb to number one (41 weeks) on the Adult Contemporary chart by a solo artist.[12] As of 2024, Malone holds the record for the artist with the most diamond-certified songs, with eight to his name.[13]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nAustin Richard Post was born on July 4, 1995,[1] in Syracuse, New York.[14][15] He was raised by his father, Richard Post, and his stepmother, Jodie. His father had been a DJ in his youth and introduced Malone to many different genres of music including hip hop, country, and rock.[16] When Malone was nine years old,[17] he and his family moved to Grapevine, Texas, after his father became the manager of concessions for the football team Dallas Cowboys.[18][19] Malone began to play the guitar and auditioned for the American band Crown the Empire in 2010, but was rejected after his guitar strings broke during the audition. He credited his initial interest in learning guitar to the video game *Guitar Hero*.[20]\n\n\nMalone has expressed his affinity for alternative rock music, and appeared for a DJ set at Emo Nite in Los Angeles, California, in June 2017, playing songs by American alt-rock band My Chemical Romance at the event.[21] According to Malone, his first foray into professional music began when he was in a heavy metal band.[22] He says soon afterwards he transitioned to softer rock as well as hip hop, before beginning to experiment on FL Studio.[23]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### 2011–2016: Career beginnings and *Stoney*[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Malone performing in 2015\nAccording to Malone, he chose \"Post Malone\" as his stage name when he was \"14 or 15\".[24] The name was rumored to be a reference to the professional basketball player Karl Malone,[25] but Malone later explained that \"Post\" is his last name, and he used a \"rap name generator\" to get \"Malone\".[4] At the age of 16, using audio editor Audacity, Malone created his first mixtape, *Young and After Them Riches*.[26] He showed it to some of his classmates at Grapevine High School.[20][27] He was voted \"Most Likely to Become Famous\" by his classmates as a senior in high school. He worked at a Chicken Express as a teenager.[20]\n\n\nAt age 17, Malone released a parody synth-pop ballad song called \"Why Don't You Love Me\" under the alias Leon DeChino, intended for a school project. The song reappeared online in 2016. Malone later referenced the DeChino alias on his song \"Psycho\".[28][29]\n\n\nMalone later enrolled in Tarrant County College, but dropped out.[30] After leaving college, Malone moved to Los Angeles with his longtime friend Jason Probst, a professional game streamer.[31][32][33]\n\n\nAfter moving to Los Angeles, Malone, Probst, and several other producers and artists formed the music group BLCKVRD and recorded music together.[34] Several members of the group, including Malone, moved into a house in the San Fernando Valley together.

His father had been a DJ in his youth and introduced Malone to many different genres of music including hip hop, country, and rock.[16] When Malone was nine years old,[17] he and his family moved to Grapevine, Texas, after his father became the manager of concessions for the football team Dallas Cowboys.[18][19] Malone began to play the guitar and auditioned for the American band Crown the Empire in 2010, but was rejected after his guitar strings broke during the audition. He credited his initial interest in learning guitar to the video game *Guitar Hero*.[20]\n\n\nMalone has expressed his affinity for alternative rock music, and appeared for a DJ set at Emo Nite in Los Angeles, California, in June 2017, playing songs by American alt-rock band My Chemical Romance at the event.[21] According to Malone, his first foray into professional music began when he was in a heavy metal band.[22] He says soon afterwards he transitioned to softer rock as well as hip hop, before beginning to experiment on FL Studio.[23]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### 2011–2016: Career beginnings and *Stoney*[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Malone performing in 2015\nAccording to Malone, he chose \"Post Malone\" as his stage name when he was \"14 or 15\".[24] The name was rumored to be a reference to the professional basketball player Karl Malone,[25] but Malone later explained that \"Post\" is his last name, and he used a \"rap name generator\" to get \"Malone\".[4] At the age of 16, using audio editor Audacity, Malone created his first mixtape, *Young and After Them Riches*.[26] He showed it to some of his classmates at Grapevine High School.[20][27] He was voted \"Most Likely to Become Famous\" by his classmates as a senior in high school.

Stating that Brexit will \"impact every aspect of the music industry.

Not a Man in a Skirt\", referencing news reports that had misgendered the victim.[128][24] Ricky Martin has stated that Bad Bunny \"has become an icon for the Latin queer community\" due to his support of gay and transgender Latinos as well as his embrace of drag culture.[24] Bad Bunny was recognized for his allyship in 2023 by queer advocacy organization GLAAD when Ricky Martin presented him with the Vanguard Award for allyship at the 34th GLAAD Media Awards.[129]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBad Bunny has also expressed publicly that he views his own sexuality as fluid. In a 2020 interview with the *Los Angeles Times*, he stated “At the end of the day, I don’t know if in 20 years I will like a man. One never knows in life. But at the moment I am heterosexual and I like women.”[130] This fluidity was on display at the 2022 MTV Video Music Awards, when he kissed a male dancer during his performance of “Tití Me Preguntó.”[131]\n\n\n\n### Activism[edit]\n\n\nBad Bunny criticized the lack of humanitarian aid in the wake of Hurricane Maria, which devastated the island of Puerto Rico.[132] He established the Good Bunny Foundation, which distributes toys to children living in poverty in Puerto Rico.[24]\n\n\nIn 2019, he was nominated for Telemundo's inaugural *Premios Tu Música Urbano*, in the category of \"Humanitarian Award of the Year.\"[133]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n**Bad Bunny** at Wikipedia's sister projects:\n* ![](image)**Media** from Commons\n* ![](image)**Quotations** from Wikiquote\n* ![](image)**Data** from Wikidata\n\n| Authority control databases ![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\n |\n| --- |\n| International | * ISNI\n* VIAF\n* WorldCat\n |\n| National | * Chile\n* Spain\n* Germany\n* United States\n* Czech Republic\n |\n| Artists | * Grammy Awards\n* MusicBrainz\n |\n| Other | * IdRef\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n143. **^** Powell, Jason (April 10, 2021). \"WrestleMania 37 results: Powell's live review of night one featuring Sasha Banks vs. Bianca Belair for the Smackdown Women's Championship, Bobby Lashley vs. Drew McIntyre for the WWE Championship, Kofi Kingston and Xavier Woods vs. AJ Styles and Omos for the Raw Tag Titles, Bad Bunny and Damian Priest vs The Miz and John Morrison\". *Pro Wrestling Dot Net*.
