K. Rowling's series of eponymous novels. The majority of the books' plot covers seven years in the life of the orphan Harry, who, on his eleventh birthday, learns he is a wizard. Thus, he attends Hogwarts to practise magic under the guidance of the kindly headmaster Albus Dumbledore and other school professors along with his best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. Harry also discovers that he is already famous throughout the novel's magical community, and that his fate is tied with that of Lord Voldemort – the internationally feared Dark Wizard and murderer of his parents, James and Lily Potter. The book and film series revolve around Harry's struggle to adapt to the wizarding world and defeat Voldemort.\n\n\nHarry is regarded as a fictional icon and has been described by many critics, readers, and audiences as one of the greatest literary and film characters of all time. He was portrayed by Daniel Radcliffe in all eight *Harry Potter* films from *Philosopher's Stone* (2001) to *Deathly Hallows – Part 2* (2011).\n\n\n\n\n## Concept and creation[edit]\n\n\nAccording to Rowling, the idea for both the Harry Potter books and its eponymous character came while waiting for a delayed train from Manchester, England to London in 1990. She stated that the idea of \"this scrawny, black-haired, bespectacled boy who didn't know he was a wizard became more and more real to me\".[2] While developing the ideas for her book, she also decided to make Harry an orphan who attended a boarding school called Hogwarts. She explained in a 1999 interview with *The Guardian*: \"Harry had to be an orphan—so that he's a free agent, with no fear of letting down his parents, disappointing them ... Hogwarts has to be a boarding school—half the important stuff happens at night! Then there's the security. Having a child of my own reinforces my belief that children above all want security, and that's what Hogwarts offers Harry.\"[3]\n\n\nHer own mother's death on 30 December 1990 inspired Rowling to write Harry as a boy longing for his dead parents, his anguish becoming \"much deeper, much more real\" than in earlier drafts because she related to it herself.[2] In a 2000 interview with *The Guardian*, Rowling also established that the character of Wart in T. H. White's novel *The Once and Future King* is \"Harry's spiritual ancestor\".[4] Finally, she established Harry's birth date as 31 July, the same as her own. However, she maintained that Harry was not directly based on any real-life person: \"he came just out of a part of me\".[5]\n\n\nRowling has also maintained that Harry is a suitable real-life role model for children. \"The advantage of a fictional hero or heroine is that you can know them better than you can know a living hero, many of whom you would never meet ... if people like Harry and identify with him, I am pleased, because I think he is very likeable.\"[6]\n\n\n\n## Appearances[edit]\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*[edit]\n\n\nHarry is an orphan living with his abusive aunt and uncle, Vernon and Petunia Dursley and their bullying son, Dudley. On his eleventh birthday, Harry discovers he is a wizard when Rubeus Hagrid delivers him an acceptance letter to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He learns that his parents, James and Lily Potter, were murdered by a powerful dark wizard, Lord Voldemort. Harry, instead, survived Voldemort's killing curse, which ended up bouncing back and apparently killing Voldemort, leaving a lightning bolt shaped scar on his forehead. Thus Harry became famous in the wizarding world.\n\n\nHagrid takes Harry to Diagon Alley to shop for his school supplies. He gifts Harry an owl that he names Hedwig, while Harry buys his very first wand at Ollivanders. The owner reveals to him that the cores of Harry and Lord Voldemort's wands have feathers from the same phoenix bird, establishing a powerful connection between the two. At the end of the summer, Harry boards the Hogwarts Express, where he befriends Ronald Weasley and meets Hermione Granger, who both him and Ron initially dislike. Upon his arrival at Hogwarts, Harry is sorted into Gryffindor House after begging the Sorting Hat not to put him in Slytherin House. He finds mentors in Transfiguration professor and head of Gryffindor Minerva McGonagall and headmaster Albus Dumbledore, whereas he forms a rivalry with Draco Malfoy, a classmate from an elitist wizarding family, and the condescending Potions master, Severus Snape, Draco's mentor and the head of Slytherin House. Following an unfortunate accident during his Flying class, Harry becomes the youngest Seeker on the Gryffindor Quidditch team in a century. Harry and Ron are tricked by Malfoy into leaving their dorms at night and Hermione follows them. While trying to hide, they come across a gigantic three-headed dog guarding a trapdoor. The three finally become best friends when Harry and Ron save Hermione from a troll. During Christmas holidays, Harry receives an anonymous gift – his father's invisibility cloak. Aided by the cloak, he is able to explore the school undisturbed. On one of his nightly trips, he sees his parents in an abandoned mirror. It is the Mirror of Erised, which shows what the viewer most desires.\n\n\nProfessor Snape's behavior and leg injury arouse the suspicion of Harry, Ron and Hermione, who believe he is attempting to enter the trapdoor. After Harry loses control of his broomstick, Hermione thinks Snape has jinxed Harry's broom. News arrives that someone attempted to rob the same Gringotts Bank's vault from which Hagrid had previously retrieved an item on Dumbledore's orders. Harry and his friends suspect it is the same object as the one beneath the trapdoor, which they identify with the philosopher's stone. Harry and his friends decide to descend through the trapdoor to protect the stone, but they are presented with a series of obstacles and Ron and Hermione are forced to remain behind. Harry faces the Defence Against the Dark Arts professor, Quirinus Quirrell, who reveals he was behind all the difficulties they encountered throughout the school year. Voldemort now inhabits Quirrell's body and is trying to obtain the philosopher's stone, hidden in the Mirror of Erised. The mirror recognises Harry's lack of greed for the stone and deposits it into his pocket, but Quirrell soon discovers it and tries to snatch it from Harry. The professor attempts to kill him. However, his flesh burns upon contact with Harry's skin. Harry's scar begins hurting and he passes out.\n\n\nHarry awakens in the school's infirmary, where Dumbledore explains how Harry originally survived Voldemort. His mother's sacrifice created a magical protection for him, which also acted against and killed Professor Quirrell. Voldemort unfortunately survived, while the philosopher's stone has been destroyed to prevent it being stolen. During the school's year-end feast, Gryffindor is awarded the House Cup thanks to the many points Harry and his friends obtained with their adventure. Harry returns to the Dursleys for the summer.\n\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets*[edit]\n\n\nIn the second book, *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets*, Rowling pits Harry against Tom Riddle, Lord Voldemort's \"memory\" within a secret diary which has possessed Ron's younger sister Ginny. When Muggle-born students are suddenly being Petrified, many suspect that Harry may be behind the attacks, further alienating him from his peers. Furthermore, Harry begins to doubt his worthiness for House of Gryffindor, particularly considering he discovers he shares Lord Voldemort's ability to communicate with snakes via Parseltongue. In the climax, Ginny disappears. To rescue her, Harry battles Riddle and the monster he controls that is hidden in the Chamber of Secrets. To defeat the monster, Harry summons the Sword of Godric Gryffindor from the Sorting Hat supplied by Dumbledore's pet phoenix, Fawkes. In doing so, Dumbledore later restores Harry's self-esteem by explaining that that feat is clear proof of his worthiness of his present house.\n\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban*[edit]\n\n\nIn the third book, *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban*, Rowling uses a time travel premise. Harry learns that his parents were betrayed to Voldemort by their friend Peter Pettigrew, who framed Harry's godfather Sirius Black for the crimes, condemning him to Azkaban, the wizard prison. When Sirius escapes to find Harry, Harry and Hermione use a Time Turner to save him and a hippogriff named Buckbeak. When Pettigrew escapes, an innocent Sirius becomes a hunted fugitive once again. Harry learns how to create a Patronus, which takes the form of a stag, the same as his late father's.\n\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire*[edit]\n\n\nIn the previous books, Harry is written as a child, but Rowling states that in the fourth novel, *Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire*, \"Harry's horizons are literally and metaphorically widening as he grows older.\"[7] Harry's developing maturity becomes apparent when he becomes romantically interested in Cho Chang, a student in Ravenclaw house. Tension mounts, however, when Harry is mysteriously chosen by the Goblet of Fire to compete in the dangerous Triwizard Tournament, even though another Hogwarts champion, Cedric Diggory, has already been selected. Voldemort uses the Tournament for an elaborate scheme to lure Harry into a deadly trap. During the Tournament's final challenge, Harry and Cedric are transported to a graveyard, using a portkey, where Cedric is killed by Peter Pettigrew, and Voldemort, aided by Pettigrew, uses Harry's blood in a gruesome ritual to resurrect his body. When Harry duels Voldemort, their wands' magical streams connect, forcing the spirit echoes of Voldemort's victims, including Cedric and James and Lily Potter, to be expelled from his wand. The spirits briefly protect Harry as he escapes to Hogwarts with Cedric's body. For Rowling, this scene is important because it shows Harry's bravery, and by retrieving Cedric's corpse, he demonstrates selflessness and compassion. Says Rowling, \"He wants to save Cedric's parents additional pain.\" She added that preventing Cedric's body from falling into Voldemort's hands is based on the classic scene in the *Iliad* where Achilles retrieves the body of his best friend Patroclus from the hands of Hector. Rowling also mentioned that book four rounds off an era in Harry's life, and the remaining three books are another,[7] \"He's no longer protected. He's been very protected until now. But he's very young to have that experience. Most of us don't get that until a bit later in life. He's only just coming up to 15 and that's it now.\"[8]\n\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix*[edit]\n\n\nIn the fifth book, *Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix*, the Ministry of Magic has been waging a smear campaign against Harry and Dumbledore, disputing their claims that Voldemort has returned. Harry is made to look like an attention-seeking liar, and Dumbledore a trouble-maker. A new character is introduced when the Ministry of Magic appoints Dolores Umbridge as the latest Hogwarts' Defence Against the Dark Arts instructor (and Ministry spy). Because the paranoid Ministry suspects that Dumbledore is building a wizard army to overthrow them, Umbridge refuses to teach students real defensive magic. She gradually gains more power, eventually ousting Dumbledore and seizing control of the school. As a result, Harry's increasingly angry and erratic behaviour nearly estranges him from Ron and Hermione.\n\n\nRowling says she put Harry through extreme emotional stress to show his emotional vulnerability and humanity—a contrast to his nemesis, Voldemort. \"[Harry is] a very *human* hero, and this is, obviously, a contrast, between him, as a very human hero, and Voldemort, who has deliberately *de*humanised himself. And Harry, therefore, did have to reach a point where he did almost break down, and say he *didn't* want to play any more, he *didn't* want to be the hero any more – and he'd lost too much. And he didn't want to lose anything else. So that – *Phoenix* was the point at which I decided he would have his breakdown.\"[9]\n\n\nAt Hermione's urging, Harry forms a secret student organisation called Dumbledore's Army to teach more meaningful defence against the dark arts as Professor Umbridge is making them read off a textbook. Their plan is thwarted, however, when a Dumbledore's Army member, Marietta Edgecombe, betrays them and informs Umbridge about the D.A., causing Dumbledore to be ousted as Headmaster. Harry suffers another emotional blow, when his beloved godfather, Sirius, is killed during a duel with Sirius' cousin, the Death Eater Bellatrix Lestrange, at the Department of Mysteries, but Harry ultimately defeats Voldemort's plan to steal an important prophecy. Rowling stated: \"And now he [Harry] will rise from the ashes strengthened.\"[9] A side plot of *Order of the Phoenix* involves Harry's romance with Cho Chang, but the relationship quickly unravels. Says Rowling: \"They were never going to be happy, it was better that it ended early!\"[10]\n\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince*[edit]\n\n\nIn the sixth book, *Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince*, Harry enters a tumultuous puberty that, Rowling says, is based on her and her younger sister's own difficult teenage years.[11] Rowling also made an intimate statement about Harry's personal life: \"Because of the demands of the adventure that Harry is following, he has had less sexual experience than boys of his age might have had.\"[12] This inexperience with romance was a factor in Harry's failed relationship with Cho. Now his thoughts concern Ginny, and a vital plot point in the last chapter includes Harry ending their budding romance to protect her from Voldemort.\n\n\nA new character appears when former Hogwarts Potions master Horace Slughorn replaces Snape, who assumes the Defence Against the Dark Arts post. Harry suddenly excels in Potions, using an old textbook once belonging to a talented student known only as \"The Half-Blood Prince\". The book contains many handwritten notes, revisions, and new spells; Hermione, however, believes Harry's use of it is cheating. Through private meetings with Dumbledore, Harry learns about Voldemort's orphaned youth, his rise to power, and how he splintered his soul into Horcruxes to achieve immortality. Two Horcruxes have been destroyed—the diary and a ring; and Harry and Dumbledore locate another, although it is a fake. When Death Eaters invade Hogwarts, Snape kills Dumbledore. As Snape escapes, he proclaims that he is the Half-Blood Prince (being the son of a muggle father and the pure-blood Eileen Prince). It now falls upon Harry to find and destroy Voldemort's remaining Horcruxes and to avenge Dumbledore's death. In a 2005 interview, Rowling stated that [after the events in the sixth book] Harry has, \"taken the view that they are now at war. He does become more battle-hardened. He's now ready to go out fighting. And he's after revenge [against Voldemort and Snape].\"[13]\n\n\nThis book also focuses on the mysterious activities of Harry's rival Draco Malfoy. Voldemort has coerced a frightened Malfoy into attempting to kill Dumbledore. During a duel in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom, Harry uses the Half-Blood Prince's spell, *Sectumsempra*, on Malfoy, who suffers near-fatal injuries as a result. Harry is horrified by what he has done and also comes to feel sympathy for Draco, after learning he was forced to do Voldemort's bidding under the threat of his and his parents' deaths.\n\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows*[edit]\n\n\nIn *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows*, Harry, Ron, and Hermione leave Hogwarts to complete Dumbledore's task: to search for and destroy Voldemort's remaining four Horcruxes, then find and kill the Dark Lord. The three pit themselves against Voldemort's newly formed totalitarian police state, an action that tests Harry's courage and moral character. Voldemort's seizure of the Ministry of Magic leads to discriminatory and genocidal policies against Muggle-borns, fuelled by propaganda and fear. According to J. K. Rowling, telling scenes are when Harry uses *Cruciatus Curse* and *Imperius Curse*, unforgivable curses for torture and mind-control, on Voldemort's servants, and also when he casts *Sectumsempra* on Draco Malfoy during the bathroom fight in the sixth book. Each time shows a \"flawed and mortal\" side to Harry. However, she explains, \"He is also in an extreme situation and attempting to defend somebody very good against a violent and murderous opponent.\"[14]\n\n\nHarry experiences occasional disturbing visions of Draco being forced to perform the Death Eaters' bidding and feels \"sickened ... by the use to which Draco was now being put by Voldemort\", again showing his compassion for an enemy.\n\n\nEach Horcrux Harry must defeat cannot be destroyed easily. They must be destroyed with basilisk venom, Godric Gryffindor's sword, or some other destructive substance. In Book Two, Harry destroys the first horcrux, Tom Riddle's diary, with a basilisk fang, and in Book Six Dumbledore destroys the ring with Gryffindor's sword. Ron destroys Slytherin's locket with the sword, Hermione destroys Hufflepuff's cup with a basilisk fang, and Crabbe destroys Ravenclaw's diadem with Fiendfyre (cursed flame). Neville kills the snake Nagini with the sword, and Voldemort destroys the final accidental Horcrux: a fragment of soul embedded in Harry's scar.\n\n\nHarry comes to recognise that his own single-mindedness makes him predictable to his enemies and often clouds his perceptions. When Voldemort kills Snape later in the story, Harry discovers that Snape was not the traitorous murderer he believed him to be, but a tragic antihero who was loyal to Dumbledore. In Chapter 33 ('The Prince's Tale') Snape's memories reveal that he loved Harry's mother Lily, but their friendship ended over his association with future Death Eaters and his \"blood purity\" beliefs. When Voldemort murdered the Potters, a grieving Snape vowed to protect Lily's child, although he loathed young Harry for being James Potter's son. The memories also reveal that Snape did not murder Dumbledore, but carried out Dumbledore's prearranged plan. Dumbledore, dying from a slow-spreading curse, wanted to protect Snape's position within the Death Eaters and to spare Draco from completing Voldemort's task of murdering him.\n\n\nTo defeat Harry, Voldemort steals the most powerful wand ever created, the Elder Wand, from Dumbledore's tomb and twice casts the Killing Curse on Harry with it. The first attempt merely stuns Harry into a deathlike state; the murder attempt fails because Voldemort used Harry's blood in his resurrection during book four. The protection that his mother gave Harry with her sacrifice tethers Harry to life, as long as his blood and her sacrifice run in the veins of Voldemort. In the chapter \"King's Cross\", Dumbledore's spirit talks to Harry whilst in this deathlike state. Dumbledore informs Harry that when Voldemort disembodied himself during his failed attempt to kill Harry as a baby, Harry became an unintentional Horcrux; Harry could not kill Voldemort while the Dark Lord's soul shard remained within Harry's body. The piece of Voldemort's soul within Harry was destroyed through Voldemort's first killing curse with the Elder Wand because Harry willingly faced death, which cast a sacrificial protection on the defenders of Hogwarts.\n\n\nIn the book's climax, Voldemort's second Killing Curse hurled at Harry also fails and rebounds upon Voldemort, finally killing him. The spell fails because Harry, not Voldemort, had become the Elder Wand's true master and the wand could not harm its own master. Harry has each of the Hallows (the Invisibility Cloak, the Resurrection Stone, and the Elder Wand) at some point in the story but never unites them. However, J. K. Rowling said the difference between Harry and Voldemort is that Harry willingly accepts mortality, making him stronger than his nemesis. \"The real master of Death accepts that he must die, and that there are much worse things in the world of the living.\" At the very end, Harry decides to leave the Elder Wand in Dumbledore's tomb and the Resurrection Stone hidden in the forest, but he keeps the Invisibility Cloak because it had belonged to his father.[14]\n\n\n\n#### Epilogue[edit]\n\n\nIn the epilogue of *Deathly Hallows*, which is set nineteen years after Voldemort's death, Harry and Ginny are a couple and have three children: James Sirius Potter, who has already been at Hogwarts for at least one year, Albus Severus Potter, who is starting his first year there, and Lily Luna Potter, who is two years away from her first year at the school. According to Rowling, after Voldemort's defeat, Harry joins the \"reshuffled\" Auror Department under Kingsley Shacklebolt's mentoring, and ends up eventually rising to become Head of said department in 2007.[15] Rowling said that his old rival Draco has a grudging gratitude towards Harry for saving his life in the final battle, but the two are not friends.[14]\n\n\n\n## Film appearances[edit]\n\n\nIn the eight *Harry Potter* films screened from 2001 to 2011, Harry Potter was portrayed by British actor Daniel Radcliffe. Radcliffe was asked to audition for the role of Harry in 2000 by producer David Heyman, while in attendance at a play titled *Stones in His Pockets* in London.[16][17]\n\n\nIn a 2007 interview with MTV, Radcliffe stated that, for him, Harry is a classic coming of age character: \"That's what the films are about for me: a loss of innocence, going from being a young kid in awe of the world around him, to someone who is more battle-hardened by the end of it.\"[18] He also said that for him, important factors in Harry's psyche are his survivor's guilt in regard to his deceased parents and his lingering loneliness. Because of this, Radcliffe talked to a bereavement counsellor to help him prepare for the role.[18] Radcliffe was quoted as saying that he wished for Harry to die in the books, but he clarified that he \"can't imagine any other way they can be concluded\".[18] After reading the last book, where Harry and his friends do indeed survive and have children, Radcliffe stated he was glad about the ending and lauded Rowling for the conclusion of the story.[19] Radcliffe stated that the most repeated question he has been asked is how *Harry Potter* has influenced his own life, to which he regularly answers it has been \"fine\", and that he did not feel pigeonholed by the role, but rather sees it as a huge privilege to portray Harry.[20]\n\n\nRadcliffe's Harry was named the 36th greatest movie character of all time in 2011, and 67th in 2018 by *Empire*.[21]\n\n\n\n## Appearance in other material[edit]\n\n\nIn *Harry Potter and the Cursed Child*, Harry appears again with his son Albus Severus, who was one of the two main protagonists of the series with Draco's son Scorpius.\n\n\n\n## Characterisation[edit]\n\n\n### Outward appearance[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A stylized image of Harry and the two most instantly recognizable features of his appearance: his lightning bolt scar and circular glasses\nThroughout the series, Harry is described as having his father's perpetually untidy black hair, his mother's bright green eyes, and a lightning bolt-shaped scar on his forehead. He is further described as \"small and skinny for his age\" with \"a thin face\" and \"knobbly knees\", and he wears Windsor glasses. In the first book, his scar is described as \"the only thing Harry liked about his own appearance\". When asked about the meaning behind Harry's lightning bolt scar, Rowling said, \"I wanted him to be physically marked by what he has been through. It was an outward expression of what he has been through inside ... It is almost like being the chosen one or the cursed one, in a sense.\"[22] In the later part of the series Harry grows taller, and by the seventh book is said to be 'almost' the height of his father, and 'tall' by other characters.[23]\n\n\nRowling explained that Harry's image came to her when she first thought up Harry Potter, seeing him as a \"scrawny, black-haired, bespectacled boy\".[2] She also mentioned that she thinks Harry's glasses are the clue to his vulnerability.[24]\n\n\n\n### Personality[edit]\n\n\nAccording to Rowling, Harry is strongly guided by his own conscience, and has a keen feeling of what is right and wrong. Having \"very limited access to truly caring adults\", Rowling said, Harry \"is forced, for such a young person, to make his own choices\".[25] He \"does make mistakes\", she conceded, but in the end, he does what his conscience tells him to do. According to Rowling, one of Harry's pivotal scenes came in the fourth book when he protects his dead schoolmate Cedric Diggory's body from Voldemort, because it shows he is brave and selfless.[7]\n\n\nRowling has stated that Harry's character flaws include anger and impulsiveness; however, Harry is also innately honourable.[14][26] \"He's not a cruel boy. He's competitive, and he's a fighter. He doesn't just lie down and take abuse. But he does have native integrity, which makes him a hero to me. He's a normal boy but with those qualities most of us really admire.\"[27] For the most part, Harry shows humility and modesty, often downplaying his achievements; though he uses a litany of his adventures as examples of his maturity early in the fifth book. However, these very same accomplishments are later employed to explain why he should lead Dumbledore's Army, at which point he asserts them as having just been luck, and denies that they make him worthy of authority. After the seventh book, Rowling commented that Harry has the ultimate character strength, which not even Voldemort possesses: the acceptance of the inevitability of death.\n\n\n\n### Magical abilities and skills[edit]\n\n\nThroughout the series, Harry Potter is described as a gifted wizard apprentice. He has a particular talent for flying, which manifests itself in *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone* the first time he tries it, and gets him a place on a Quidditch team one year before the normal minimum joining age. He captains it in his sixth year. In his fourth year (*Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire*), Harry is able to confront a dragon on his broomstick.\n\n\nHarry is also gifted in Defence Against the Dark Arts, in which he becomes proficient due to his repeated encounters with Voldemort and various monsters. In his third year, Harry becomes able to cast the very advanced Patronus Charm, and by his fifth year he has become so talented at the subject that he is able to teach his fellow students in Dumbledore's Army, some even older than him how to defend themselves against Dark Magic. At the end of that year, he achieves an 'Outstanding' Defence Against the Dark Arts O.W.L., something that not even Hermione achieved. He is a skilled duellist, the only one of the six Dumbledore's Army members to be neither injured nor incapacitated during the battle with Death Eaters in the Department of Mysteries in *[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix*. He also fends off numerous Death Eaters during his flight to the Burrow at the beginning of *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows*.\n\n\nHarry also had the unusual ability to speak and understand \"Parseltongue\", a language associated with Dark Magic. This, it transpires, is because he harbours a piece of Voldemort's soul. He loses this ability after the part of Voldemort's soul inside him is destroyed at the end of *The Deathly Hallows*. However, in the events of *Harry Potter and the Cursed Child*, it was revealed that he had not lost the ability to recognise or speak the language when he encountered Delphini, Voldemort's daughter, who was trying to use his son and Draco Malfoy's son Scorpius to fulfill a prophecy that could guarantee the return of Voldemort by changing time.\n\n\n\n### Possessions[edit]\n\n\nHarry's parents left behind a somewhat large pile of wizard's gold, used as currency in the world of magic, in a vault in the wizarding bank, Gringotts. After Sirius' death later in the series, all of his remaining possessions are also passed along to Harry, including Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place, and Sirius's vast amount of gold were transferred into Harry's account at Gringotts.\n\n\nAmong the school items Harry purchases in Diagon Alley after discovering his gold inheritance is his first wand, an 11-inch-long holly and phoenix feather model that he learns is the twin of Voldemort's wand, as the feathers that both wands contain as their cores both comes from Fawkes, the phoenix that Dumbledore keeps as a pet in his office until his death in *Half-Blood Prince*.[28] Harry's wand is broken in *Deathly Hallows*. For a time, he borrows Hermione's wand, and later steals Draco's. With his defeat of Voldemort at the end of the series, he comes into the possession of the Elder Wand, but uses it only to repair his holly wand, before returning it to Dumbledore's tomb, from which Voldemort had stolen it. In the film version of *Deathly Hallows Part 2*, Harry destroys the Elder Wand.\n\n\nHarry also inherits indirectly two of his father's prized possessions. One is the Marauder's Map, given to him by interim owners Fred and George Weasley, which endows Harry with comprehensive knowledge of Hogwarts' facilities, grounds, and occupants. The other is his father's invisibility cloak, given to him by Dumbledore, which eventually proves Harry's descent from the Peverell family. Harry uses these tools both to aid in excursions at school and to protect those he cares about; the Invisibility Cloak, in particular, can hide two full-grown people. If three fully-grown people hide under the cloak their feet will be visible. When Harry reaches his age of maturity at seventeen, Molly Weasley gives him a pocket watch which had once belonged to her brother Fabian Prewett, as it is traditional to give a boy a watch when he turns seventeen.\n\n\nThroughout the majority of the books, Harry also has a pet owl named Hedwig, used to deliver and receive messages and packages. Hedwig is killed in the seventh book, about which Rowling says: \"The loss of Hedwig represented a loss of innocence and security. She has been almost like a cuddly toy to Harry at times. I know that death upset a lot of people!\"[14] As a Quidditch player, Harry has owned two high-quality brooms. The first, a Nimbus Two Thousand, was procured for him by Professor Minerva McGonagall when Harry was added to Gryffindor's Quidditch team despite being a first-year student. This broom was destroyed by the Whomping Willow during a match in Harry's third year. It was replaced by a Firebolt, an even faster (and more expensive) broom, purchased for Harry by Sirius; however, as Sirius was believed to be trying to murder Harry at the time, the broom was subjected to stringent security inspections before Harry was allowed to ride it. Harry used it throughout his Hogwarts career until it, along with Hedwig, was lost during the July escape from Privet Drive in the final book.\n\n\nHarry also owns a mokeskin pouch, or small 'bag' that is used for storing items, which no one but the owner can get out. He receives this from Hagrid as a 17th birthday present. Harry uses the pouch throughout the course of *Deathly Hallows* to keep several sentimental (yet, as he himself admits, otherwise worthless) objects such as the Marauder's Map, a shard of the magical mirror given to him by his god-father Sirius, the fake Horcrux locket that had belonged to Sirius's brother R.A.B. (Regulus Arcturus Black), the Snitch bequeathed to him by Dumbledore, containing the Resurrection Stone that had previously been set into Voldemort's grandfather Marvolo Gaunt's signet ring, which Harry discovers is actually the second Hallow, a letter from his mother to Sirius with part of a photo (of him and his father, James), and eventually, his own broken wand (which Harry later repairs with the Elder Wand).\n\n\n\n### Family[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n*Harry Potter* family tree\n |\n| --- |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

Potter and the Cursed Child*, Bellatrix is depicted as having had a secret daughter — Delphini (Delphi) \"The Augurey\" — who claims to also be the daughter of Lord Voldemort.\n |\n\n\nIn the novels, Harry is the only child of James and Lily Potter, orphaned as an infant. Rowling made Harry an orphan from the early drafts of her first book. She felt an orphan would be the most interesting character to write about.[3] However, after her mother's death, Rowling wrote Harry as a child longing to see his dead parents again, incorporating her own anguish into him. Harry is categorised as a \"half-blood\" wizard in the series, because although both his parents were magical, Lily was \"Muggle-born\", and James was a pure-blood.\n\n\nHarry's aunt and uncle kept the truth about his parents' deaths from Harry, telling him that they had died in a car crash.[2] James Potter is a descendant of Ignotus Peverell, the third of the three original owners of the Deathly Hallows, and thus so is Harry, a realisation he makes during the course of the final book. The lineage continues at the end of the saga through his three children with Ginny: James Sirius Potter, Albus Severus Potter and Lily Luna Potter.\n\n\nIn an original piece published on the Pottermore website in September 2015, Rowling described the history of the Potter family in greater detail, beginning with the 12th-century wizard Linfred of Stinchcombe, \"a locally well-beloved and eccentric man, whose nickname, 'the Potterer', became corrupted in time to 'Potter'\". Linfred was the inventor of a number of remedies that evolved into potions still used in the modern day, including Skele-Gro and Pepperup Potion. These successful products garnered Linfred the earnings that formed the basis of the family's wealth, which grew with the work of successive generations. Linfred's oldest son, Hardwin, married a beautiful young witch from Godric's Hollow named Iolanthe Peverell, the granddaughter of Ignotus Peverell, who continued the tradition of passing down Ignotus' Invisibility Cloak through the generations. Two of Harry Potter's ancestors have sat on the Wizengamot: Ralston Potter and Henry Potter. Ralston was a member from 1612 to 1652, and an ardent supporter of the Statute of Secrecy. Henry Potter, known as \"Harry\" to his closest loved ones, was a direct descendant of Hardwin and Iolanthe, and a paternal great-grandfather of Harry Potter. Henry served on the Wizengamot from 1913 to 1921, and caused a minor controversy when he publicly condemned then Minister for Magic, Archer Evermonde, for prohibiting the magical community from helping Muggles waging the First World War. Henry's son, Fleamont Potter, who was given his grandmother's surname as his given name in order to grant the dying wish of Henry's mother to continue her family name, garnered a reputation for his duels at Hogwarts, which were provoked when others mocked him for his name. Fleamont quadrupled the family gold by creating magical Sleekeazy's Hair Potion, selling his company at a vast profit when he retired. Fleamont and his wife, Euphemia, had given up hope of having a child when she became pregnant with their son, James, who would go on to marry Lily Evans and bear a son of their own, Harry Potter. Fleamont and Euphemia lived to see James and Lily marry, but they would never meet their famous grandson, as they both died of dragon pox, stemming from their advanced age.[29][30]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Statue of Harry Potter on a Nimbus 2000 in Leicester Square, London\nIn 2002, Harry Potter was voted No. 85 among the \"100 Best Fictional Characters\" by *Book* magazine[31] and also voted the 35th \"Worst Briton\" in Channel 4's \"100 Worst Britons We Love to Hate\" programme.[32] *Entertainment Weekly* ranked Harry Potter number two on its 2010 \"100 Greatest Characters of the Last 20 Years\" list, saying \"Long after we've turned the last page and watched the last end credit, Harry still feels like someone we know. And that's the most magical thing about him.\"[33] UGO Networks listed Harry as one of their best heroes of all time, who said that \"Harry is a hero to the often oppressed and downtrodden young fan boys and girls out there, who finally have an icon that is respected and revered by those who might otherwise look down on robe-wearing and wand waving as dork fodder\".[34] Harry Potter was also ranked number thirty-six on *Empire*'s 2008 list of \"100 Greatest Movie Characters of All Time\".[35] IGN said that Harry Potter was their favourite *Harry Potter* character, calling him a \"sympathetic figure\" and saying in response to his fights against Voldemort that \"everybody loves an underdog story of good vs. evil\".[36]\n\n\nOn the other hand, he has received criticism. In *The Irish Times*, Ed Power wrote \"Potter, by contrast, is an anointed cherub, told he is special from the very outset. He has no winning attributes yet ... is fawned over endlessly. Harry is thus the ultimate 'Special One' – celebrated as an overachiever before he's achieved anything. ... In Potter, [Rowling] encourages the underage reader to identify with a young man who is exceptional only because the author insists this to be the case. You're extraordinary no matter what. Is that an outlook I want to pass onto my kids?\"[37] Author Lannah Marshall criticised the character, saying \"What I hear about Harry Potter, more often than not, is that he is a bland character. Defence of this includes that he is an audience surrogate, or what I call a 'puppet protagonist'. A puppet protagonist is a main character with dull, limited personality, enabling the audience to step inside the role and use their imagination to fill in the rest. The prevalence of first-person narration within Young Adult (YA) simply adds to the tide of puppet protagonists; introducing hundreds of bland, forgetful leads into interesting and complex stories to allow the reader to feel part of the tale. It's like we're going back to the second-person horrors of choose-your-own-adventure books.\"[38]\n\n\nDespite blowback from some Christian fundamentalists critical of Rowling's usage of witchcraft and magic in the series,[39] other Christian critics, including Rev. John Killinger, have argued that Potter is a Christ figure in the series. Killinger opined in 2002 that \"J.K. Rowling has written *the* Christ story of the 21st century, and it's wonderful that she has attained such a magnificent following worldwide.\" He noted several allusions to Jesus in Potter's character arcs in *Philosopher's Stone* and *Chamber of Secrets*.[40] Rowling herself later admitted that the Gospel story inspired that of Harry Potter, especially with his ultimate sacrifice in *Deathly Hallows* and apparent death before returning to defeat Voldemort once and for all.[41]\n\n\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Harry and the Potters perform at the Horace Mann School in Riverdale, Bronx, New York.\nAccording to halloweenonline.com, *Harry Potter* sets were the fifth-best selling Halloween costume of 2005.[42] In addition, wizard rock bands like Harry and the Potters and others regularly dress up in the style of Harry Potter, sporting painted forehead scars, black wigs, and round bottle top glasses. Wizard rock is a musical movement dating from 2002 that consists of at least 200 bands made up of young musicians, playing songs about *Harry Potter*.[43][44] The movement started in Massachusetts with the band Harry and the Potters, who cosplay as Harry during live performances.[45][46]\n\n\n\n### Parodies[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Parodies of Harry Potter\n\nIn April 2009, a group of University of Michigan students eventually known as StarKid Productions performed *Harry Potter: The Musical*, a two-act musical parody that featured major elements from all seven books and an original score. They posted the entire musical on their YouTube channel but removed it in late June, to edit some more mature elements from the videos. The musical, re-titled *A Very Potter Musical*, was reposted on 5 July 2009, starring Darren Criss as Harry Potter. A sequel was premiered at the 2010 HPEF Harry Potter Conference Infinitus, and released on YouTube on 22 July at 8 pm EST. The sequel was called *A Very Potter Sequel* and featured the Death Eaters using the Time-Turner to go back in time to Harry's first year in Hogwarts.[47] Harry Potter is spoofed in the *Barry Trotter* series by American writer Michael Gerber, where a \"Barry Trotter\" appears as the eponymous antihero. On his homepage, Gerber describes Trotter as an unpleasant character who \"drinks too much, eats like a pig, sleeps until noon, and owes everybody money\".[48] The author stated \"[s]ince I really liked Rowling's books ... I felt obligated to try to write a spoof worthy of the originals\".[49]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Kyle McCarley [@KyleMcCarley] (21 June 2019). \"Alohamora!

K. Rowling's series of eponymous novels. The majority of the books' plot covers seven years in the life of the orphan Harry, who, on his eleventh birthday, learns he is a wizard. Thus, he attends Hogwarts to practise magic under the guidance of the kindly headmaster Albus Dumbledore and other school professors along with his best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. Harry also discovers that he is already famous throughout the novel's magical community, and that his fate is tied with that of Lord Voldemort – the internationally feared Dark Wizard and murderer of his parents, James and Lily Potter. The book and film series revolve around Harry's struggle to adapt to the wizarding world and defeat Voldemort.\n\n\nHarry is regarded as a fictional icon and has been described by many critics, readers, and audiences as one of the greatest literary and film characters of all time. He was portrayed by Daniel Radcliffe in all eight *Harry Potter* films from *Philosopher's Stone* (2001) to *Deathly Hallows – Part 2* (2011).\n\n\n\n\n## Concept and creation[edit]\n\n\nAccording to Rowling, the idea for both the Harry Potter books and its eponymous character came while waiting for a delayed train from Manchester, England to London in 1990. She stated that the idea of \"this scrawny, black-haired, bespectacled boy who didn't know he was a wizard became more and more real to me\".[2] While developing the ideas for her book, she also decided to make Harry an orphan who attended a boarding school called Hogwarts. She explained in a 1999 interview with *The Guardian*: \"Harry had to be an orphan—so that he's a free agent, with no fear of letting down his parents, disappointing them ... Hogwarts has to be a boarding school—half the important stuff happens at night! Then there's the security. Having a child of my own reinforces my belief that children above all want security, and that's what Hogwarts offers Harry.\"[3]\n\n\nHer own mother's death on 30 December 1990 inspired Rowling to write Harry as a boy longing for his dead parents, his anguish becoming \"much deeper, much more real\" than in earlier drafts because she related to it herself.[2] In a 2000 interview with *The Guardian*, Rowling also established that the character of Wart in T. H. White's novel *The Once and Future King* is \"Harry's spiritual ancestor\".[4] Finally, she established Harry's birth date as 31 July, the same as her own. However, she maintained that Harry was not directly based on any real-life person: \"he came just out of a part of me\".[5]\n\n\nRowling has also maintained that Harry is a suitable real-life role model for children. \"The advantage of a fictional hero or heroine is that you can know them better than you can know a living hero, many of whom you would never meet ... if people like Harry and identify with him, I am pleased, because I think he is very likeable.\"[6]\n\n\n\n## Appearances[edit]\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*[edit]\n\n\nHarry is an orphan living with his abusive aunt and uncle, Vernon and Petunia Dursley and their bullying son, Dudley. On his eleventh birthday, Harry discovers he is a wizard when Rubeus Hagrid delivers him an acceptance letter to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He learns that his parents, James and Lily Potter, were murdered by a powerful dark wizard, Lord Voldemort. Harry, instead, survived Voldemort's killing curse, which ended up bouncing back and apparently killing Voldemort, leaving a lightning bolt shaped scar on his forehead. Thus Harry became famous in the wizarding world.\n\n\nHagrid takes Harry to Diagon Alley to shop for his school supplies. He gifts Harry an owl that he names Hedwig, while Harry buys his very first wand at Ollivanders. The owner reveals to him that the cores of Harry and Lord Voldemort's wands have feathers from the same phoenix bird, establishing a powerful connection between the two. At the end of the summer, Harry boards the Hogwarts Express, where he befriends Ronald Weasley and meets Hermione Granger, who both him and Ron initially dislike. Upon his arrival at Hogwarts, Harry is sorted into Gryffindor House after begging the Sorting Hat not to put him in Slytherin House. He finds mentors in Transfiguration professor and head of Gryffindor Minerva McGonagall and headmaster Albus Dumbledore, whereas he forms a rivalry with Draco Malfoy, a classmate from an elitist wizarding family, and the condescending Potions master, Severus Snape, Draco's mentor and the head of Slytherin House. Following an unfortunate accident during his Flying class, Harry becomes the youngest Seeker on the Gryffindor Quidditch team in a century. Harry and Ron are tricked by Malfoy into leaving their dorms at night and Hermione follows them. While trying to hide, they come across a gigantic three-headed dog guarding a trapdoor. The three finally become best friends when Harry and Ron save Hermione from a troll. During Christmas holidays, Harry receives an anonymous gift – his father's invisibility cloak. Aided by the cloak, he is able to explore the school undisturbed. On one of his nightly trips, he sees his parents in an abandoned mirror. It is the Mirror of Erised, which shows what the viewer most desires.\n\n\nProfessor Snape's behavior and leg injury arouse the suspicion of Harry, Ron and Hermione, who believe he is attempting to enter the trapdoor. After Harry loses control of his broomstick, Hermione thinks Snape has jinxed Harry's broom. News arrives that someone attempted to rob the same Gringotts Bank's vault from which Hagrid had previously retrieved an item on Dumbledore's orders. Harry and his friends suspect it is the same object as the one beneath the trapdoor, which they identify with the philosopher's stone. Harry and his friends decide to descend through the trapdoor to protect the stone, but they are presented with a series of obstacles and Ron and Hermione are forced to remain behind. Harry faces the Defence Against the Dark Arts professor, Quirinus Quirrell, who reveals he was behind all the difficulties they encountered throughout the school year. Voldemort now inhabits Quirrell's body and is trying to obtain the philosopher's stone, hidden in the Mirror of Erised. The mirror recognises Harry's lack of greed for the stone and deposits it into his pocket, but Quirrell soon discovers it and tries to snatch it from Harry. The professor attempts to kill him. However, his flesh burns upon contact with Harry's skin. Harry's scar begins hurting and he passes out.\n\n\nHarry awakens in the school's infirmary, where Dumbledore explains how Harry originally survived Voldemort. His mother's sacrifice created a magical protection for him, which also acted against and killed Professor Quirrell. Voldemort unfortunately survived, while the philosopher's stone has been destroyed to prevent it being stolen. During the school's year-end feast, Gryffindor is awarded the House Cup thanks to the many points Harry and his friends obtained with their adventure. Harry returns to the Dursleys for the summer.\n\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets*[edit]\n\n\nIn the second book, *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets*, Rowling pits Harry against Tom Riddle, Lord Voldemort's \"memory\" within a secret diary which has possessed Ron's younger sister Ginny. When Muggle-born students are suddenly being Petrified, many suspect that Harry may be behind the attacks, further alienating him from his peers. Furthermore, Harry begins to doubt his worthiness for House of Gryffindor, particularly considering he discovers he shares Lord Voldemort's ability to communicate with snakes via Parseltongue. In the climax, Ginny disappears. To rescue her, Harry battles Riddle and the monster he controls that is hidden in the Chamber of Secrets. To defeat the monster, Harry summons the Sword of Godric Gryffindor from the Sorting Hat supplied by Dumbledore's pet phoenix, Fawkes. In doing so, Dumbledore later restores Harry's self-esteem by explaining that that feat is clear proof of his worthiness of his present house.\n\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban*[edit]\n\n\nIn the third book, *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban*, Rowling uses a time travel premise. Harry learns that his parents were betrayed to Voldemort by their friend Peter Pettigrew, who framed Harry's godfather Sirius Black for the crimes, condemning him to Azkaban, the wizard prison. When Sirius escapes to find Harry, Harry and Hermione use a Time Turner to save him and a hippogriff named Buckbeak. When Pettigrew escapes, an innocent Sirius becomes a hunted fugitive once again. Harry learns how to create a Patronus, which takes the form of a stag, the same as his late father's.\n\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire*[edit]\n\n\nIn the previous books, Harry is written as a child, but Rowling states that in the fourth novel, *Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire*, \"Harry's horizons are literally and metaphorically widening as he grows older.\"[7] Harry's developing maturity becomes apparent when he becomes romantically interested in Cho Chang, a student in Ravenclaw house. Tension mounts, however, when Harry is mysteriously chosen by the Goblet of Fire to compete in the dangerous Triwizard Tournament, even though another Hogwarts champion, Cedric Diggory, has already been selected. Voldemort uses the Tournament for an elaborate scheme to lure Harry into a deadly trap. During the Tournament's final challenge, Harry and Cedric are transported to a graveyard, using a portkey, where Cedric is killed by Peter Pettigrew, and Voldemort, aided by Pettigrew, uses Harry's blood in a gruesome ritual to resurrect his body. When Harry duels Voldemort, their wands' magical streams connect, forcing the spirit echoes of Voldemort's victims, including Cedric and James and Lily Potter, to be expelled from his wand. The spirits briefly protect Harry as he escapes to Hogwarts with Cedric's body. For Rowling, this scene is important because it shows Harry's bravery, and by retrieving Cedric's corpse, he demonstrates selflessness and compassion. Says Rowling, \"He wants to save Cedric's parents additional pain.\" She added that preventing Cedric's body from falling into Voldemort's hands is based on the classic scene in the *Iliad* where Achilles retrieves the body of his best friend Patroclus from the hands of Hector. Rowling also mentioned that book four rounds off an era in Harry's life, and the remaining three books are another,[7] \"He's no longer protected. He's been very protected until now. But he's very young to have that experience. Most of us don't get that until a bit later in life. He's only just coming up to 15 and that's it now.\"[8]\n\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix*[edit]\n\n\nIn the fifth book, *Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix*, the Ministry of Magic has been waging a smear campaign against Harry and Dumbledore, disputing their claims that Voldemort has returned. Harry is made to look like an attention-seeking liar, and Dumbledore a trouble-maker. A new character is introduced when the Ministry of Magic appoints Dolores Umbridge as the latest Hogwarts' Defence Against the Dark Arts instructor (and Ministry spy). Because the paranoid Ministry suspects that Dumbledore is building a wizard army to overthrow them, Umbridge refuses to teach students real defensive magic. She gradually gains more power, eventually ousting Dumbledore and seizing control of the school. As a result, Harry's increasingly angry and erratic behaviour nearly estranges him from Ron and Hermione.\n\n\nRowling says she put Harry through extreme emotional stress to show his emotional vulnerability and humanity—a contrast to his nemesis, Voldemort. \"[Harry is] a very *human* hero, and this is, obviously, a contrast, between him, as a very human hero, and Voldemort, who has deliberately *de*humanised himself. And Harry, therefore, did have to reach a point where he did almost break down, and say he *didn't* want to play any more, he *didn't* want to be the hero any more – and he'd lost too much. And he didn't want to lose anything else. So that – *Phoenix* was the point at which I decided he would have his breakdown.\"[9]\n\n\nAt Hermione's urging, Harry forms a secret student organisation called Dumbledore's Army to teach more meaningful defence against the dark arts as Professor Umbridge is making them read off a textbook. Their plan is thwarted, however, when a Dumbledore's Army member, Marietta Edgecombe, betrays them and informs Umbridge about the D.A., causing Dumbledore to be ousted as Headmaster. Harry suffers another emotional blow, when his beloved godfather, Sirius, is killed during a duel with Sirius' cousin, the Death Eater Bellatrix Lestrange, at the Department of Mysteries, but Harry ultimately defeats Voldemort's plan to steal an important prophecy. Rowling stated: \"And now he [Harry] will rise from the ashes strengthened.\"[9] A side plot of *Order of the Phoenix* involves Harry's romance with Cho Chang, but the relationship quickly unravels. Says Rowling: \"They were never going to be happy, it was better that it ended early!\"[10]\n\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince*[edit]\n\n\nIn the sixth book, *Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince*, Harry enters a tumultuous puberty that, Rowling says, is based on her and her younger sister's own difficult teenage years.[11] Rowling also made an intimate statement about Harry's personal life: \"Because of the demands of the adventure that Harry is following, he has had less sexual experience than boys of his age might have had.\"[12] This inexperience with romance was a factor in Harry's failed relationship with Cho. Now his thoughts concern Ginny, and a vital plot point in the last chapter includes Harry ending their budding romance to protect her from Voldemort.\n\n\nA new character appears when former Hogwarts Potions master Horace Slughorn replaces Snape, who assumes the Defence Against the Dark Arts post. Harry suddenly excels in Potions, using an old textbook once belonging to a talented student known only as \"The Half-Blood Prince\". The book contains many handwritten notes, revisions, and new spells; Hermione, however, believes Harry's use of it is cheating. Through private meetings with Dumbledore, Harry learns about Voldemort's orphaned youth, his rise to power, and how he splintered his soul into Horcruxes to achieve immortality. Two Horcruxes have been destroyed—the diary and a ring; and Harry and Dumbledore locate another, although it is a fake. When Death Eaters invade Hogwarts, Snape kills Dumbledore. As Snape escapes, he proclaims that he is the Half-Blood Prince (being the son of a muggle father and the pure-blood Eileen Prince). It now falls upon Harry to find and destroy Voldemort's remaining Horcruxes and to avenge Dumbledore's death. In a 2005 interview, Rowling stated that [after the events in the sixth book] Harry has, \"taken the view that they are now at war. He does become more battle-hardened. He's now ready to go out fighting. And he's after revenge [against Voldemort and Snape].\"[13]\n\n\nThis book also focuses on the mysterious activities of Harry's rival Draco Malfoy. Voldemort has coerced a frightened Malfoy into attempting to kill Dumbledore. During a duel in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom, Harry uses the Half-Blood Prince's spell, *Sectumsempra*, on Malfoy, who suffers near-fatal injuries as a result. Harry is horrified by what he has done and also comes to feel sympathy for Draco, after learning he was forced to do Voldemort's bidding under the threat of his and his parents' deaths.\n\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows*[edit]\n\n\nIn *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows*, Harry, Ron, and Hermione leave Hogwarts to complete Dumbledore's task: to search for and destroy Voldemort's remaining four Horcruxes, then find and kill the Dark Lord. The three pit themselves against Voldemort's newly formed totalitarian police state, an action that tests Harry's courage and moral character. Voldemort's seizure of the Ministry of Magic leads to discriminatory and genocidal policies against Muggle-borns, fuelled by propaganda and fear. According to J. K. Rowling, telling scenes are when Harry uses *Cruciatus Curse* and *Imperius Curse*, unforgivable curses for torture and mind-control, on Voldemort's servants, and also when he casts *Sectumsempra* on Draco Malfoy during the bathroom fight in the sixth book. Each time shows a \"flawed and mortal\" side to Harry. However, she explains, \"He is also in an extreme situation and attempting to defend somebody very good against a violent and murderous opponent.\"[14]\n\n\nHarry experiences occasional disturbing visions of Draco being forced to perform the Death Eaters' bidding and feels \"sickened ... by the use to which Draco was now being put by Voldemort\", again showing his compassion for an enemy.\n\n\nEach Horcrux Harry must defeat cannot be destroyed easily. They must be destroyed with basilisk venom, Godric Gryffindor's sword, or some other destructive substance. In Book Two, Harry destroys the first horcrux, Tom Riddle's diary, with a basilisk fang, and in Book Six Dumbledore destroys the ring with Gryffindor's sword. Ron destroys Slytherin's locket with the sword, Hermione destroys Hufflepuff's cup with a basilisk fang, and Crabbe destroys Ravenclaw's diadem with Fiendfyre (cursed flame). Neville kills the snake Nagini with the sword, and Voldemort destroys the final accidental Horcrux: a fragment of soul embedded in Harry's scar.\n\n\nHarry comes to recognise that his own single-mindedness makes him predictable to his enemies and often clouds his perceptions. When Voldemort kills Snape later in the story, Harry discovers that Snape was not the traitorous murderer he believed him to be, but a tragic antihero who was loyal to Dumbledore. In Chapter 33 ('The Prince's Tale') Snape's memories reveal that he loved Harry's mother Lily, but their friendship ended over his association with future Death Eaters and his \"blood purity\" beliefs. When Voldemort murdered the Potters, a grieving Snape vowed to protect Lily's child, although he loathed young Harry for being James Potter's son. The memories also reveal that Snape did not murder Dumbledore, but carried out Dumbledore's prearranged plan. Dumbledore, dying from a slow-spreading curse, wanted to protect Snape's position within the Death Eaters and to spare Draco from completing Voldemort's task of murdering him.\n\n\nTo defeat Harry, Voldemort steals the most powerful wand ever created, the Elder Wand, from Dumbledore's tomb and twice casts the Killing Curse on Harry with it. The first attempt merely stuns Harry into a deathlike state; the murder attempt fails because Voldemort used Harry's blood in his resurrection during book four. The protection that his mother gave Harry with her sacrifice tethers Harry to life, as long as his blood and her sacrifice run in the veins of Voldemort. In the chapter \"King's Cross\", Dumbledore's spirit talks to Harry whilst in this deathlike state. Dumbledore informs Harry that when Voldemort disembodied himself during his failed attempt to kill Harry as a baby, Harry became an unintentional Horcrux; Harry could not kill Voldemort while the Dark Lord's soul shard remained within Harry's body. The piece of Voldemort's soul within Harry was destroyed through Voldemort's first killing curse with the Elder Wand because Harry willingly faced death, which cast a sacrificial protection on the defenders of Hogwarts.\n\n\nIn the book's climax, Voldemort's second Killing Curse hurled at Harry also fails and rebounds upon Voldemort, finally killing him. The spell fails because Harry, not Voldemort, had become the Elder Wand's true master and the wand could not harm its own master. Harry has each of the Hallows (the Invisibility Cloak, the Resurrection Stone, and the Elder Wand) at some point in the story but never unites them. However, J. K. Rowling said the difference between Harry and Voldemort is that Harry willingly accepts mortality, making him stronger than his nemesis. \"The real master of Death accepts that he must die, and that there are much worse things in the world of the living.\" At the very end, Harry decides to leave the Elder Wand in Dumbledore's tomb and the Resurrection Stone hidden in the forest, but he keeps the Invisibility Cloak because it had belonged to his father.[14]\n\n\n\n#### Epilogue[edit]\n\n\nIn the epilogue of *Deathly Hallows*, which is set nineteen years after Voldemort's death, Harry and Ginny are a couple and have three children: James Sirius Potter, who has already been at Hogwarts for at least one year, Albus Severus Potter, who is starting his first year there, and Lily Luna Potter, who is two years away from her first year at the school. According to Rowling, after Voldemort's defeat, Harry joins the \"reshuffled\" Auror Department under Kingsley Shacklebolt's mentoring, and ends up eventually rising to become Head of said department in 2007.[15] Rowling said that his old rival Draco has a grudging gratitude towards Harry for saving his life in the final battle, but the two are not friends.[14]\n\n\n\n## Film appearances[edit]\n\n\nIn the eight *Harry Potter* films screened from 2001 to 2011, Harry Potter was portrayed by British actor Daniel Radcliffe. Radcliffe was asked to audition for the role of Harry in 2000 by producer David Heyman, while in attendance at a play titled *Stones in His Pockets* in London.[16][17]\n\n\nIn a 2007 interview with MTV, Radcliffe stated that, for him, Harry is a classic coming of age character: \"That's what the films are about for me: a loss of innocence, going from being a young kid in awe of the world around him, to someone who is more battle-hardened by the end of it.\"[18] He also said that for him, important factors in Harry's psyche are his survivor's guilt in regard to his deceased parents and his lingering loneliness. Because of this, Radcliffe talked to a bereavement counsellor to help him prepare for the role.[18] Radcliffe was quoted as saying that he wished for Harry to die in the books, but he clarified that he \"can't imagine any other way they can be concluded\".[18] After reading the last book, where Harry and his friends do indeed survive and have children, Radcliffe stated he was glad about the ending and lauded Rowling for the conclusion of the story.[19] Radcliffe stated that the most repeated question he has been asked is how *Harry Potter* has influenced his own life, to which he regularly answers it has been \"fine\", and that he did not feel pigeonholed by the role, but rather sees it as a huge privilege to portray Harry.[20]\n\n\nRadcliffe's Harry was named the 36th greatest movie character of all time in 2011, and 67th in 2018 by *Empire*.[21]\n\n\n\n## Appearance in other material[edit]\n\n\nIn *Harry Potter and the Cursed Child*, Harry appears again with his son Albus Severus, who was one of the two main protagonists of the series with Draco's son Scorpius.\n\n\n\n## Characterisation[edit]\n\n\n### Outward appearance[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A stylized image of Harry and the two most instantly recognizable features of his appearance: his lightning bolt scar and circular glasses\nThroughout the series, Harry is described as having his father's perpetually untidy black hair, his mother's bright green eyes, and a lightning bolt-shaped scar on his forehead. He is further described as \"small and skinny for his age\" with \"a thin face\" and \"knobbly knees\", and he wears Windsor glasses. In the first book, his scar is described as \"the only thing Harry liked about his own appearance\". When asked about the meaning behind Harry's lightning bolt scar, Rowling said, \"I wanted him to be physically marked by what he has been through. It was an outward expression of what he has been through inside ... It is almost like being the chosen one or the cursed one, in a sense.\"[22] In the later part of the series Harry grows taller, and by the seventh book is said to be 'almost' the height of his father, and 'tall' by other characters.[23]\n\n\nRowling explained that Harry's image came to her when she first thought up Harry Potter, seeing him as a \"scrawny, black-haired, bespectacled boy\".[2] She also mentioned that she thinks Harry's glasses are the clue to his vulnerability.[24]\n\n\n\n### Personality[edit]\n\n\nAccording to Rowling, Harry is strongly guided by his own conscience, and has a keen feeling of what is right and wrong. Having \"very limited access to truly caring adults\", Rowling said, Harry \"is forced, for such a young person, to make his own choices\".[25] He \"does make mistakes\", she conceded, but in the end, he does what his conscience tells him to do. According to Rowling, one of Harry's pivotal scenes came in the fourth book when he protects his dead schoolmate Cedric Diggory's body from Voldemort, because it shows he is brave and selfless.[7]\n\n\nRowling has stated that Harry's character flaws include anger and impulsiveness; however, Harry is also innately honourable.[14][26] \"He's not a cruel boy. He's competitive, and he's a fighter. He doesn't just lie down and take abuse. But he does have native integrity, which makes him a hero to me. He's a normal boy but with those qualities most of us really admire.\"[27] For the most part, Harry shows humility and modesty, often downplaying his achievements; though he uses a litany of his adventures as examples of his maturity early in the fifth book. However, these very same accomplishments are later employed to explain why he should lead Dumbledore's Army, at which point he asserts them as having just been luck, and denies that they make him worthy of authority. After the seventh book, Rowling commented that Harry has the ultimate character strength, which not even Voldemort possesses: the acceptance of the inevitability of death.\n\n\n\n### Magical abilities and skills[edit]\n\n\nThroughout the series, Harry Potter is described as a gifted wizard apprentice. He has a particular talent for flying, which manifests itself in *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone* the first time he tries it, and gets him a place on a Quidditch team one year before the normal minimum joining age. He captains it in his sixth year. In his fourth year (*Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire*), Harry is able to confront a dragon on his broomstick.\n\n\nHarry is also gifted in Defence Against the Dark Arts, in which he becomes proficient due to his repeated encounters with Voldemort and various monsters. In his third year, Harry becomes able to cast the very advanced Patronus Charm, and by his fifth year he has become so talented at the subject that he is able to teach his fellow students in Dumbledore's Army, some even older than him how to defend themselves against Dark Magic. At the end of that year, he achieves an 'Outstanding' Defence Against the Dark Arts O.W.L., something that not even Hermione achieved. He is a skilled duellist, the only one of the six Dumbledore's Army members to be neither injured nor incapacitated during the battle with Death Eaters in the Department of Mysteries in *[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix*. He also fends off numerous Death Eaters during his flight to the Burrow at the beginning of *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows*.\n\n\nHarry also had the unusual ability to speak and understand \"Parseltongue\", a language associated with Dark Magic. This, it transpires, is because he harbours a piece of Voldemort's soul. He loses this ability after the part of Voldemort's soul inside him is destroyed at the end of *The Deathly Hallows*. However, in the events of *Harry Potter and the Cursed Child*, it was revealed that he had not lost the ability to recognise or speak the language when he encountered Delphini, Voldemort's daughter, who was trying to use his son and Draco Malfoy's son Scorpius to fulfill a prophecy that could guarantee the return of Voldemort by changing time.\n\n\n\n### Possessions[edit]\n\n\nHarry's parents left behind a somewhat large pile of wizard's gold, used as currency in the world of magic, in a vault in the wizarding bank, Gringotts. After Sirius' death later in the series, all of his remaining possessions are also passed along to Harry, including Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place, and Sirius's vast amount of gold were transferred into Harry's account at Gringotts.\n\n\nAmong the school items Harry purchases in Diagon Alley after discovering his gold inheritance is his first wand, an 11-inch-long holly and phoenix feather model that he learns is the twin of Voldemort's wand, as the feathers that both wands contain as their cores both comes from Fawkes, the phoenix that Dumbledore keeps as a pet in his office until his death in *Half-Blood Prince*.[28] Harry's wand is broken in *Deathly Hallows*. For a time, he borrows Hermione's wand, and later steals Draco's. With his defeat of Voldemort at the end of the series, he comes into the possession of the Elder Wand, but uses it only to repair his holly wand, before returning it to Dumbledore's tomb, from which Voldemort had stolen it. In the film version of *Deathly Hallows Part 2*, Harry destroys the Elder Wand.\n\n\nHarry also inherits indirectly two of his father's prized possessions. One is the Marauder's Map, given to him by interim owners Fred and George Weasley, which endows Harry with comprehensive knowledge of Hogwarts' facilities, grounds, and occupants. The other is his father's invisibility cloak, given to him by Dumbledore, which eventually proves Harry's descent from the Peverell family. Harry uses these tools both to aid in excursions at school and to protect those he cares about; the Invisibility Cloak, in particular, can hide two full-grown people. If three fully-grown people hide under the cloak their feet will be visible. When Harry reaches his age of maturity at seventeen, Molly Weasley gives him a pocket watch which had once belonged to her brother Fabian Prewett, as it is traditional to give a boy a watch when he turns seventeen.\n\n\nThroughout the majority of the books, Harry also has a pet owl named Hedwig, used to deliver and receive messages and packages. Hedwig is killed in the seventh book, about which Rowling says: \"The loss of Hedwig represented a loss of innocence and security. She has been almost like a cuddly toy to Harry at times. I know that death upset a lot of people!\"[14] As a Quidditch player, Harry has owned two high-quality brooms. The first, a Nimbus Two Thousand, was procured for him by Professor Minerva McGonagall when Harry was added to Gryffindor's Quidditch team despite being a first-year student. This broom was destroyed by the Whomping Willow during a match in Harry's third year. It was replaced by a Firebolt, an even faster (and more expensive) broom, purchased for Harry by Sirius; however, as Sirius was believed to be trying to murder Harry at the time, the broom was subjected to stringent security inspections before Harry was allowed to ride it. Harry used it throughout his Hogwarts career until it, along with Hedwig, was lost during the July escape from Privet Drive in the final book.\n\n\nHarry also owns a mokeskin pouch, or small 'bag' that is used for storing items, which no one but the owner can get out. He receives this from Hagrid as a 17th birthday present. Harry uses the pouch throughout the course of *Deathly Hallows* to keep several sentimental (yet, as he himself admits, otherwise worthless) objects such as the Marauder's Map, a shard of the magical mirror given to him by his god-father Sirius, the fake Horcrux locket that had belonged to Sirius's brother R.A.B. (Regulus Arcturus Black), the Snitch bequeathed to him by Dumbledore, containing the Resurrection Stone that had previously been set into Voldemort's grandfather Marvolo Gaunt's signet ring, which Harry discovers is actually the second Hallow, a letter from his mother to Sirius with part of a photo (of him and his father, James), and eventually, his own broken wand (which Harry later repairs with the Elder Wand).\n\n\n\n### Family[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n*Harry Potter* family tree\n |\n| --- |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

Potter and the Cursed Child*, Bellatrix is depicted as having had a secret daughter — Delphini (Delphi) \"The Augurey\" — who claims to also be the daughter of Lord Voldemort.\n |\n\n\nIn the novels, Harry is the only child of James and Lily Potter, orphaned as an infant. Rowling made Harry an orphan from the early drafts of her first book. She felt an orphan would be the most interesting character to write about.[3] However, after her mother's death, Rowling wrote Harry as a child longing to see his dead parents again, incorporating her own anguish into him. Harry is categorised as a \"half-blood\" wizard in the series, because although both his parents were magical, Lily was \"Muggle-born\", and James was a pure-blood.\n\n\nHarry's aunt and uncle kept the truth about his parents' deaths from Harry, telling him that they had died in a car crash.[2] James Potter is a descendant of Ignotus Peverell, the third of the three original owners of the Deathly Hallows, and thus so is Harry, a realisation he makes during the course of the final book. The lineage continues at the end of the saga through his three children with Ginny: James Sirius Potter, Albus Severus Potter and Lily Luna Potter.\n\n\nIn an original piece published on the Pottermore website in September 2015, Rowling described the history of the Potter family in greater detail, beginning with the 12th-century wizard Linfred of Stinchcombe, \"a locally well-beloved and eccentric man, whose nickname, 'the Potterer', became corrupted in time to 'Potter'\". Linfred was the inventor of a number of remedies that evolved into potions still used in the modern day, including Skele-Gro and Pepperup Potion. These successful products garnered Linfred the earnings that formed the basis of the family's wealth, which grew with the work of successive generations. Linfred's oldest son, Hardwin, married a beautiful young witch from Godric's Hollow named Iolanthe Peverell, the granddaughter of Ignotus Peverell, who continued the tradition of passing down Ignotus' Invisibility Cloak through the generations. Two of Harry Potter's ancestors have sat on the Wizengamot: Ralston Potter and Henry Potter. Ralston was a member from 1612 to 1652, and an ardent supporter of the Statute of Secrecy. Henry Potter, known as \"Harry\" to his closest loved ones, was a direct descendant of Hardwin and Iolanthe, and a paternal great-grandfather of Harry Potter. Henry served on the Wizengamot from 1913 to 1921, and caused a minor controversy when he publicly condemned then Minister for Magic, Archer Evermonde, for prohibiting the magical community from helping Muggles waging the First World War. Henry's son, Fleamont Potter, who was given his grandmother's surname as his given name in order to grant the dying wish of Henry's mother to continue her family name, garnered a reputation for his duels at Hogwarts, which were provoked when others mocked him for his name. Fleamont quadrupled the family gold by creating magical Sleekeazy's Hair Potion, selling his company at a vast profit when he retired. Fleamont and his wife, Euphemia, had given up hope of having a child when she became pregnant with their son, James, who would go on to marry Lily Evans and bear a son of their own, Harry Potter. Fleamont and Euphemia lived to see James and Lily marry, but they would never meet their famous grandson, as they both died of dragon pox, stemming from their advanced age.[29][30]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Statue of Harry Potter on a Nimbus 2000 in Leicester Square, London\nIn 2002, Harry Potter was voted No. 85 among the \"100 Best Fictional Characters\" by *Book* magazine[31] and also voted the 35th \"Worst Briton\" in Channel 4's \"100 Worst Britons We Love to Hate\" programme.[32] *Entertainment Weekly* ranked Harry Potter number two on its 2010 \"100 Greatest Characters of the Last 20 Years\" list, saying \"Long after we've turned the last page and watched the last end credit, Harry still feels like someone we know. And that's the most magical thing about him.\"[33] UGO Networks listed Harry as one of their best heroes of all time, who said that \"Harry is a hero to the often oppressed and downtrodden young fan boys and girls out there, who finally have an icon that is respected and revered by those who might otherwise look down on robe-wearing and wand waving as dork fodder\".[34] Harry Potter was also ranked number thirty-six on *Empire*'s 2008 list of \"100 Greatest Movie Characters of All Time\".[35] IGN said that Harry Potter was their favourite *Harry Potter* character, calling him a \"sympathetic figure\" and saying in response to his fights against Voldemort that \"everybody loves an underdog story of good vs. evil\".[36]\n\n\nOn the other hand, he has received criticism. In *The Irish Times*, Ed Power wrote \"Potter, by contrast, is an anointed cherub, told he is special from the very outset. He has no winning attributes yet ... is fawned over endlessly. Harry is thus the ultimate 'Special One' – celebrated as an overachiever before he's achieved anything. ... In Potter, [Rowling] encourages the underage reader to identify with a young man who is exceptional only because the author insists this to be the case. You're extraordinary no matter what. Is that an outlook I want to pass onto my kids?\"[37] Author Lannah Marshall criticised the character, saying \"What I hear about Harry Potter, more often than not, is that he is a bland character. Defence of this includes that he is an audience surrogate, or what I call a 'puppet protagonist'. A puppet protagonist is a main character with dull, limited personality, enabling the audience to step inside the role and use their imagination to fill in the rest. The prevalence of first-person narration within Young Adult (YA) simply adds to the tide of puppet protagonists; introducing hundreds of bland, forgetful leads into interesting and complex stories to allow the reader to feel part of the tale. It's like we're going back to the second-person horrors of choose-your-own-adventure books.\"[38]\n\n\nDespite blowback from some Christian fundamentalists critical of Rowling's usage of witchcraft and magic in the series,[39] other Christian critics, including Rev. John Killinger, have argued that Potter is a Christ figure in the series. Killinger opined in 2002 that \"J.K. Rowling has written *the* Christ story of the 21st century, and it's wonderful that she has attained such a magnificent following worldwide.\" He noted several allusions to Jesus in Potter's character arcs in *Philosopher's Stone* and *Chamber of Secrets*.[40] Rowling herself later admitted that the Gospel story inspired that of Harry Potter, especially with his ultimate sacrifice in *Deathly Hallows* and apparent death before returning to defeat Voldemort once and for all.[41]\n\n\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Harry and the Potters perform at the Horace Mann School in Riverdale, Bronx, New York.\nAccording to halloweenonline.com, *Harry Potter* sets were the fifth-best selling Halloween costume of 2005.[42] In addition, wizard rock bands like Harry and the Potters and others regularly dress up in the style of Harry Potter, sporting painted forehead scars, black wigs, and round bottle top glasses. Wizard rock is a musical movement dating from 2002 that consists of at least 200 bands made up of young musicians, playing songs about *Harry Potter*.[43][44] The movement started in Massachusetts with the band Harry and the Potters, who cosplay as Harry during live performances.[45][46]\n\n\n\n### Parodies[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Parodies of Harry Potter\n\nIn April 2009, a group of University of Michigan students eventually known as StarKid Productions performed *Harry Potter: The Musical*, a two-act musical parody that featured major elements from all seven books and an original score. They posted the entire musical on their YouTube channel but removed it in late June, to edit some more mature elements from the videos. The musical, re-titled *A Very Potter Musical*, was reposted on 5 July 2009, starring Darren Criss as Harry Potter. A sequel was premiered at the 2010 HPEF Harry Potter Conference Infinitus, and released on YouTube on 22 July at 8 pm EST. The sequel was called *A Very Potter Sequel* and featured the Death Eaters using the Time-Turner to go back in time to Harry's first year in Hogwarts.[47] Harry Potter is spoofed in the *Barry Trotter* series by American writer Michael Gerber, where a \"Barry Trotter\" appears as the eponymous antihero. On his homepage, Gerber describes Trotter as an unpleasant character who \"drinks too much, eats like a pig, sleeps until noon, and owes everybody money\".[48] The author stated \"[s]ince I really liked Rowling's books ... I felt obligated to try to write a spoof worthy of the originals\".[49]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Kyle McCarley [@KyleMcCarley] (21 June 2019). \"Alohamora!

K. Rowling's *Harry Potter* series. She first appears in the novel *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone* (1997), on the Hogwarts express as a first year student on her way to Hogwarts. After Harry and Ron save her from a mountain troll in the girls' restroom, she becomes best friends with them and often uses her quick wit, deft recall, and encyclopaedic knowledge to lend aid in dire situations. Rowling has stated that Hermione resembles herself as a young girl, with her insecurity and fear of failure.[2]\n\n\nThe character has had immense popularity. The version of Hermione portrayed by Emma Watson in all eight *Harry Potter* films from *Philosopher's Stone* in 2001 to *Deathly Hallows – Part 2* in 2011 was voted the best female character of all time in a poll conducted amongst Hollywood professionals by *The Hollywood Reporter* in 2016.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## Character development[edit]\n\n\nHermione is a Muggle-born Gryffindor,[4] who becomes best friends with Harry Potter and Ron Weasley. Rowling states that she was born on 19 September 1979[2] and she was nearly twelve when she first attended Hogwarts.[5] She is an overachiever who excels academically and is described by Rowling as a \"very logical, upright and good\" character.[6] Rowling adds that Hermione's parents, two Muggle dentists, are a bit bemused by their odd daughter but \"quite proud of her all the same\".[6] They are well aware of the wizard world and have visited Diagon Alley with her.[7] Hermione is an only child.[6] But Rowling revealed in a 2004 interview that Hermione was originally intended to have a sister, but the planned sibling did not appear since she felt it \"might be too late now\" to introduce the character.[8] Rowling has called the character of Luna Lovegood the \"anti-Hermione\" as they are so very different.[9]\n\n\nRowling said the character of Hermione has several autobiographic influences: \"I did not set out to make Hermione like me but she is a bit like me. She is an exaggeration of how I was when I was younger.\"[6] She recalled being called a \"little know-it-all\" in her youth.[2] And she says that not unlike herself, \"there is a lot of insecurity and a great fear of failure\" beneath Hermione's swottiness. Finally, according to Rowling, next to Albus Dumbledore, Hermione is the perfect expository character; because of her encyclopedic knowledge, she can always be used as a plot dump to explain the *Harry Potter* universe.[10] Rowling also states that her feminist conscience is rescued by Hermione, \"who's the brightest witch of her age\" and a \"very strong female character.\"[11]\n\n\nHermione's first name is taken from a character in William Shakespeare's *The Winter's Tale*, though Rowling has said that the two characters have little to nothing in common.[12] Rowling said that she wanted her name to be unusual since if fewer girls had the name, fewer girls would get teased for it and it seemed the sort of name that \"a pair of professional dentists, who liked to prove how clever they were\" would give their daughter.[12] Her original surname was \"Puckle\", but Rowling felt the name \"did not suit her at all\", and so the less frivolous Granger was used.[2]\n\n\n\n## *Harry Potter* books[edit]\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*[edit]\n\n\nHermione first appears in *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone* when she meets Harry and Ron on the Hogwarts Express, where she mocks Ron for his inability to perform a spell to turn his rat yellow. She proves just how much she knows by declaring that she memorized all the textbooks by heart. She constantly annoys her peers with her knowledge, so Harry and Ron initially consider her arrogant, especially after she criticises Ron's incantation of the *Levitation* Charm.[13] They heartily dislike her until they rescue her from a troll, for which she is so thankful that she lies to protect them from punishment, thus winning their friendship.[14] Hermione's knack for logic later enables the trio to solve a puzzle that is essential to retrieving the Philosopher's Stone, and she defeats the constrictive Devil's Snare plant by summoning a jet of \"bluebell flame\".[15][a]\n\n\nHermione is the brains behind the plan to enter the place where the Stone is hidden. She responds to Harry's wariness of Professor Severus Snape and is also suspicious of him. She reveals to Harry and Ron that she does a lot of research in the library, which helped her defeat the Devil's Snare and work out the logic of the potions.\n\n\nRowling said on her website that she resisted her editor's requests to remove the troll scene, stating \"Hermione is so very arrogant and annoying in the early part of *Philosopher's Stone* that I really felt it needed something (literally) huge to bring her together with Harry and Ron.\"[2]\n\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets*[edit]\n\n\nHermione (along with Ron's mother Molly Weasley and a few female students of Hogwarts) develops a liking for Defence Against the Dark Arts (DADA) teacher Gilderoy Lockhart as he had written all the books required for the DADA in *Chamber of Secrets*.[16] During a morning confrontation between the Gryffindor and Slytherin Quidditch teams, a brawl nearly ensues after Draco Malfoy calls her a \"Mudblood\", an insulting epithet for Muggle-born wizards when she defends the Gryffindor Quidditch team. She concocts the Polyjuice Potion needed for the trio to disguise themselves as Draco's housemates to collect information about the Heir of Slytherin who has reopened the Chamber of Secrets. However, she is unable to join Harry and Ron in the investigation after the hair plucked from the robes of Slytherin student Millicent Bulstrode (with whom Hermione was previously matched up during Lockhart's ill-fated Duelling Club) was that of her cat, whose appearance she takes on in her human form; it takes several weeks for the effects to completely wear off. Hermione is Petrified by the basilisk after successfully identifying the creature through library research. Though she lies incapacitated in the hospital wing, the information she has found and left behind is crucial to Harry and Ron in their successful mission to solve the mystery of the Chamber of Secrets. Hermione is revived after Harry kills the basilisk, but she is distraught to learn that all end-of-year exams have been cancelled as a school treat.[17]\n\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban*[edit]\n\n\nHermione buys a cat named Crookshanks, who takes to chasing Ron's pet rat, Scabbers.[18] Before the start of term, Professor Minerva McGonagall secretly gives Hermione a Time-Turner, a device which lets her go back in time and handle her heavy class schedule, though this is not revealed until the penultimate chapter. Much tension comes into play between Hermione and her two best friends; Harry is furious with her because she told McGonagall that he got a Firebolt, which was confiscated to be inspected for traces of dark magic. Ron is angry because he feels Crookshanks caused Scabbers' disappearance, while Hermione fiercely maintains that Crookshanks is innocent.\n\n\nWhile filling in for Remus Lupin in one DADA class, Snape labels Hermione \"an insufferable know-it-all\" and penalises Gryffindor after she speaks out of turn in her attempt to describe a werewolf when no one else does. She correctly deduces Lupin's secret after completing Snape's homework assignment from the class. Crookshanks proves vital in exposing Scabbers as Peter Pettigrew, an erstwhile friend of James and Lily Potter, who revealed their whereabouts to Voldemort the night of their murders, and was able to wrongly implicate Sirius Black (revealed to be Harry's godfather) in the Potters' deaths.[19][20] The Time-Turner enables Hermione and Harry to rescue Sirius and the hippogriff Buckbeak.[19][20]\n\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire*[edit]\n\n\nHermione is horrified by the cruelty that house-elves suffer, and establishes S.P.E.W., the Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare, as an effort to gain basic rights for them. She is Bulgarian Quidditch prodigy Viktor Krum's date at the Yule Ball of the Triwizard Tournament.[21] The proper pronunciation of her name (*Her-my-oh-nee*) is interjected into the plot when she teaches it to Krum; the best he can do is \"Herm-own-ninny,\" but she has no problem with it.[2] She later gets into a heated argument with Ron after he accuses her of \"fraternising with the enemy\" about her friendship with Krum. In the book, Hermione's feelings toward Ron are hinted at when she says that Ron can't see her \"like a girl,\" but Krum could. She supports Harry through the Triwizard Tournament, helping him prepare for each task. At the end of the second task, Krum asks her to come to see him over the summer in Bulgaria, but she politely declines. Near the end of term, she stops fraudulent tabloid reporter and unregistered Animagus, Rita Skeeter, who had published defamatory material about Hermione, Harry, and Hagrid during the Triwizard Tournament, by holding her Animagus form (a beetle) captive in a jar.[22]\n\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix*[edit]\n\n\nHermione becomes a Gryffindor prefect along with Ron and befriends Luna Lovegood, but their friendship has a rocky start after Hermione chastises the publication of Luna's father: \"*The Quibbler*'s rubbish, everyone knows that.\" She also lambasts housemate Lavender Brown for believing the *Daily Prophet's* allegations of Harry fabricating stories of Voldemort's return. Ron and Hermione spend much of their time bickering, likely due to their growing romantic feelings toward one another, but they show continued loyalty to Harry. One turning point in the series is when Hermione conceives the idea of Harry secretly teaching defensive magic to a small band of students in defiance of the Ministry of Magic's dictum to teach only the subject's basic principles from a textbook, with no hands-on practice. Hermione gets an unexpectedly huge response, and the group becomes the nascent Dumbledore's Army. She is involved in the battle in the Department of Mysteries and seriously injured by a spell from Death Eater Antonin Dolohov, but makes a full recovery.[23][24]\n\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince*[edit]\n\n\nNew Potions professor Horace Slughorn invites Hermione to join his \"Slug Club\",[25] and she helps Ron retain his spot on the Gryffindor Quidditch team when she casts a confund spell on Cormac McLaggen, causing him to miss his last save attempt during Keeper tryouts. Hermione's feelings for Ron continue to grow and she decides to make a move by inviting him to Slughorn's Christmas Party, but he romances Lavender instead in retaliation for his belief that Hermione had kissed Krum years earlier. She attempts to get even by dating Cormac at the Christmas party, but her plan goes awry and she abandons him midway through the party.[26][27] Ron and Hermione continually feud with each other (Ron is upset with her because she set birds to attack him after seeing him and Lavender kissing; Hermione is mostly mad because of her growing jealousy) until he suffers a near-fatal poisoning from tainted mead, which frightens her enough to reconcile with him. After Dumbledore's death, Ron and Hermione both vow to stay by Harry's side regardless what happens.[28] A minor subplot in the book is that Hermione and Harry form a rivalry in Potions, as Hermione is used to coming first in her subjects and is angry that Harry outperforms her undeservedly by following tips and different instructions written in the margins of Harry's potions book by the previous owner. Hermione is also the only one of the trio to successfully pass her Apparition test (Ron failed, albeit barely, and Harry was too young).\n\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows*[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hermione carrying Dobby's corpse.\nIn the seventh and last book, Hermione accompanies Harry on his quest to destroy Voldemort's remaining Horcruxes. Before leaving on the quest, she helps ensure the safety of her parents by placing a false memory charm on them, making them think they are Wendell and Monica Wilkins, whose lifetime ambition is to move to Australia. She inherits Dumbledore's copy of *The Tales of Beedle the Bard*, which allows her to decipher some secrets of the Deathly Hallows. She prepared for their departure and journey by placing an Undetectable Extension Charm on a small beaded purse so she can fill the infinite depths of the bag with things they will need. Hermione's spell saves her and Harry from Lord Voldemort and his snake Nagini in Godric's Hollow, though the ricochet snaps Harry's wand. When she, Ron, and Harry are caught by Snatchers, who are hunting for Muggle-borns under the Ministry's orders, Hermione disguises Harry by temporarily disfiguring his face with a Stinging Jinx. She also tries to pass herself off as former Hogwarts student Penelope Clearwater and a half-blood to avoid persecution, but they are recognised and taken to Malfoy Manor. Bellatrix Lestrange tortures her with a Cruciatus Curse in an attempt to extract information on how Hermione, Harry, and Ron came to possess Godric Gryffindor's sword (which was supposed to be safe in the Lestrange vault at Gringotts). Bellatrix orders for Griphook the goblin to inspect the sword and tell whether it is fake or real. To save Hermione, Harry convinces him to lie to Bellatrix that the sword is a fake. When the others escape their cell, Bellatrix threatens to slit Hermione's throat. Hermione, Harry, Ron and the other prisoners being held in Malfoy Manor are eventually rescued by Dobby.\n\n\nHermione later uses Polyjuice Potion to impersonate Bellatrix when the trio steal Hufflepuff's cup (a Horcrux) from Gringotts. She, Harry, and Ron join Dumbledore's Army in the Battle of Hogwarts, during which Hermione destroys Hufflepuff's cup in the Chamber of Secrets with a basilisk fang. Hermione and Ron also share their first kiss during the battle.[29] In the final battle in the Great Hall, Hermione fights Bellatrix with the help of Ginny Weasley and Luna. However, the three of them are unable to defeat Bellatrix and stop fighting her once Molly Weasley orders them to disengage.[30]\n\n\n\n#### Epilogue[edit]\n\n\nIn the epilogue of *Deathly Hallows*, which is set nineteen years after Voldemort's death, Hermione and Ron have two children: Rose Granger-Weasley, whom they are sending off to her first year at Hogwarts, and a younger son named Hugo.[DH Ch.37] Though the epilogue does not explicitly say Hermione and Ron are married,[31] news articles and other sources treat it as fact.[32][33][34]\n\n\n\n## In other material[edit]\n\n\nIn *Harry Potter and the Cursed Child*, it is shown that Hermione has become Minister for Magic, succeeding Kingsley Shacklebolt.\n\n\n\n## Characterisation[edit]\n\n\n### Appearance[edit]\n\n\nThe books describe Hermione as having \"bushy brown hair\"[35][36][37] and brown eyes.[38] Her front buck teeth, already very large,[35][37] grow uncontrollably in *Goblet of Fire* after she is affected by a spell cast by Draco Malfoy.[39] Madam Pomfrey attends to her in the hospital wing and, at her request, shrinks the teeth down to a normal size that matches her mouth.[40] In the films, her hair is less bushy[41] and she always has regular teeth except for a scene at the end of *Philosopher's Stone* where Emma Watson wore fake teeth. She stopped wearing them for the rest of the films because they caused difficulties in speech.[42]\n\n\nThere is controversy[43] over whether Hermione's skin colour is ever categorically established in the books. Some take as proof a line from *Prisoner of Azkaban*: \"Hermione's white face was sticking out from behind a tree.\"[44] They interpret this as a direct description of her skin tone. Others interpret it as a description relative to her usual complexion, arising due to fright and anxiety as she watches Harry Potter's attempt to save the hippogriff Buckbeak from execution. J.K. Rowling herself says Hermione \"turned white\" in that she \"lost colour from her face after a shock.\"[43]\n\n\nAnother description from early in *Prisoner of Azkaban* is: \"They were there, both of them, sitting outside Florean Fortescue's Ice-Cream Parlour, Ron looking incredibly freckly, Hermione very brown, both waving frantically at him.\"[45] Some claim this is a direct description of her skin colour, while others claim it's a relative description of the results of a tan acquired over the summer break.[46]\n\n\n\n### Personality[edit]\n\n\nHermione's most prominent features include her prodigious intellect and cleverness. She is levelheaded, book-smart, and always very logical. Throughout the series, Hermione uses the skills of a librarian and teacher to gather the information needed to defeat Voldemort, the \"Dark Lord\". When in doubt, she always turns to the school library.[47] She is often bossy yet unfailingly dutiful and loyal to her friends—a person who can always be counted on. J.K. Rowling said that Hermione \"never strays off the path; she always keeps her attention focused on the job that must be done.\"[48] Despite Hermione's intelligence and bossy attitude, Rowling says Hermione has \"quite a lot of vulnerability in her personality,\"[49] as well as a \"sense of insecurity underneath,\" feels, \"utterly inadequate... and to compensate, she tries and strives to be the best at everything at school, projecting a confidence that irritates people.\"[50] During her DADA exam at the end of *Prisoner of Azkaban*, Hermione reveals that her biggest fear is failure after a Boggart takes the form of Professor McGonagall and tells her that she has failed all her exams.[51]\n\n\nHermione is extremely compassionate; and very quick to help others, especially the defenceless, such as Neville Longbottom, first-years, House-Elves, fellow Muggle-borns, half-giants like Hagrid, and werewolves like Lupin. After publication of the last book, J.K. Rowling revealed that Hermione's career in the Ministry was to fight for the rights of the oppressed and disenfranchised (such as House-elves or Muggle-borns). Hermione is also very protective of her friends and values them so much that Rowling has suggested that, if Hermione looked in the Mirror of Erised, she would see Harry, Ron, and herself alive and Voldemort defeated.[52] Hermione also learns to ignore what bullies such as Draco Malfoy say to her, often preventing Harry and Ron from retaliating and thinking of some way to outsmart him. She accepts her status as a Muggle-born, and says in *Deathly Hallows* that she is \"a Mudblood and proud of it\".[53]\n\n\n\n### Magical abilities and skills[edit]\n\n\nHermione is portrayed during the whole series as an exceptionally talented young witch. J.K. Rowling has said that Hermione is a \"borderline genius.\"[54] She got ten O.W.L.s, which were nine Outstanding and one Exceeds Expectations. She is the best student in Harry's year and is repeatedly the first student to master any spell or charm introduced in her classes and even from more advanced years, as evidenced when she can conjure a Protean Charm on the D.A.'s fake Galleon coins, which is a N.E.W.T. level charm.[55] She is also the first one of her age to be able to cast non-verbal spells.[56] Hermione is a competent duellist – Rowling has stated that during the first three books Hermione could have beaten Harry in any magical duel, but by the fourth book Harry had become so good at DADA that he would have defeated Hermione.[57] Hermione did not tend to do as well in subjects that were not learned through books or formal training, as broom flying did not come as naturally to her in her first year as it did to Harry,[58] and she showed no affinity for Divination, which she dropped from her third-year studies.[59][60] She was also not good at Wizard's Chess, as it was the only thing at which she ever lost to Ron.[61]\n\n\nHermione's Patronus is an otter, Rowling's favourite animal. In the *Deathly Hallows* book, while they enter the Ministry of Magic under disguise, Hermione impersonates Mafalda Hopkirk. Her wand is made of vine wood and dragon heartstring core; vine is the wood ascribed to Hermione's fictional birth month (September) on the Celtic calendar.[62]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\nHermione is viewed by many as a feminist icon.[63] In *The Ivory Tower and Harry Potter,* the first book-length analysis of the *Harry Potter* series (edited and compiled by Lana A. Whited), a chapter titled \"Hermione Granger and the Heritage of Gender\" by Eliza T. Dresang, discusses Hermione's role in the series and its relation to feminist debates.[64] The chapter begins with an analysis of Hermione's name and the role of previous characters with the same name in mythology and fiction, and the heritage Hermione has inherited from these characters due to her name. Dresang also emphasises Hermione's parallelism with Rowling herself and how, as Hermione has some attributes from Rowling herself, she must be a strong character.\n\n\nThe chapter also points out that, despite being born to Muggle parents, Hermione's magical abilities are innate. Her \"compulsion for study\" helps both the character's development, which makes Hermione \"a prime example that information brings power\", and the plot of the series, as her knowledge of the wizard world is often used to \"save the day\". Dresang states that \"Harry and Ron are more dependent on Hermione than she is on them.\" However, she adds that Hermione's \"hysteria and crying happen far too often to be considered a believable part of the development of Hermione's character and are quite out of line with her core role in the book.\"[64]\n\n\nUGO Networks listed Hermione as one of their best heroes of all time, saying, \"Most of us can probably recall having a classmate like Hermione when we were in grammar school\"—one who \"can at first be a little off-putting, but once you get to know her, she's not a bad chick to have on your side\".[65] *IGN* also listed Hermione as their second top *Harry Potter* character, praising her character development.[66] In 2016 *The Hollywood Reporter* did a poll of Hollywood professionals, including actors, writers and directors, into their favourite female characters of all time; Hermione topped the poll.[3]\n\n\nPhilip Nel of Kansas State University notes that \"Rowling, who worked for Amnesty International, evokes her social activism through Hermione's passion for oppressed elves and the formation of her 'Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare'\".[67] Scholars such as Brycchan Carey have praised the books' abolitionist sentiments, viewing Hermione's Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare as a model for younger readers' political engagement.[68][69]\n\n\nHowever, in an analysis for *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows*, Rowland Manthrope states that \"seven books on, we still only know her as swottish, sensible Hermione—a caricature, not a character.\"[70]\n\n\n\n## Portrayals[edit]\n\n\n### Film series[edit]\n\n\nEmma Watson played Hermione in all eight *Harry Potter* films. Watson's Oxford theatre teacher passed her name on to the casting agents of *Philosopher's Stone*, impressed with her school play performances.[71][*failed verification*] Though Watson took her audition seriously, she \"never really thought she had any chance\" of getting the part.[72] The producers were impressed by Watson's self-confidence and she outperformed the thousands of other girls who applied.[73]\n\n\nRowling herself was supportive of Watson after her first screen test.[71] When asked if she thought actors suited the characters, Rowling said, \"Yes, I did. Emma Watson in particular was very, very like Hermione when I first spoke to her, I knew she was perfect from that first phone call.\"[8]\n\n\nWatson was well-received for the first film; IGN even commented that \"from Hermione Granger's perfect introduction to her final scene, Watson is better than I could have possibly imagined. She steals the show.\"[74] IGN also wrote that her \"astute portrayal of Hermione has already become a favourite among fans.\"[75]\n\n\nBefore the production of *Half-Blood Prince*, Watson considered not returning,[76] but eventually decided that \"the pluses outweighed the minuses\" and that she could not bear to see anyone else play Hermione.[77]\n\n\nWatson has said that Hermione is a character who makes \"brain not beauty cool,\" and that though Hermione is \"slightly socially inept,\" she is \"not ashamed of herself.\"[78] When filming *Chamber of Secrets*, Watson was \"adamant\" that she wasn't like Hermione, but she reflects that \"as I got older, I realised she was the greatest role model a girl could have.\"[79] In 2007, before the release of *Order of the Phoenix,* Watson said, \"There are too many stupid girls in the media. Hermione's not scared to be clever. I think sometimes really smart girls dumb themselves down a bit, and that's bad. When I was nine or ten, I would get really upset when they tried to make me look geeky, but now I absolutely love it. I find it's so much pressure to be beautiful. Hermione doesn't care what she looks like. She's a complete tomboy.\"[77]\n\n\nScreenwriter Steve Kloves revealed in a 2003 interview that Hermione was his favourite character. \"There's something about her fierce intellect coupled with a complete lack of understanding of how she affects people sometimes that I just find charming and irresistible to write.\"[10]\n\n\n\n### Theatre[edit]\n\n\nIn *Harry Potter and the Cursed Child*, Hermione is played by Eswatini-born actress Noma Dumezweni, known for her work in *Linda*, *A Raisin in the Sun* and *A Human Being Died That Night*.[80] Dumezweni described the role as a \"privilege and a responsibility\" and said that \"we all aspire to be Hermione.\"[81] The choice of a black actress to play her, led to criticism on social media, which J.K. Rowling described as being by \"a bunch of racists\", adding that the books never explicitly mention her race or skin tone (though she did write in *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban*, \"Hermione's white face was sticking out from behind a tree.\"[44]) and that she has been portrayed as black in fan art.[43] Dumezweni herself called the backlash \"so unimaginative\",[82] stating that \"So many young actors and actresses have told me that they’re so pleased I’m playing Hermione because they can see a version of themselves on the stage.\"[83]\n\n\nDumezweni got praise for her performance; *The Independent* said that she \"did a tremendous job as the stern witch.\"[84] At the 2017 Laurence Olivier Awards, Dumezweni got the Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role for her portrayal of Hermione.[83]\n\n\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\n\nHermione has been parodied in many sketches and animated series. On *Saturday Night Live*, Lindsay Lohan played Hermione.[85] On his show *Big Impression*, Alistair McGowan did a sketch, \"Louis Potter and the Philosopher's Scone\". It featured impressions of Nigella Lawson as Hermione.[86] In 2003, Comic Relief performed a spoof story called *Harry Potter and the Secret Chamberpot of Azerbaijan*, in which Miranda Richardson, who plays Rita Skeeter in the Harry Potter films, featured as Hermione.[87][88] Hermione also features in the *Harry Bladder* sketches in *All That*, where she appears as Herheiny and is played by Lisa Foiles. *The Wedge*, an Australian sketch comedy, parodies Hermione and Harry in love on a *\"Cooking With...\"* show before being caught by Snape.[89] Hermione also appears as Hermione Ranger in *Harry Podder: Dude Where's My Wand?*, a play by Desert Star Theater in Utah, written by sisters Laura J., Amy K. and Anna M. Lewis.[90][91] In the 2008 American comedy film *Yes Man*, Allison (played by Zooey Deschanel) accompanies Carl (Jim Carrey) to a Harry Potter-themed party dressed as Hermione.\n\n\nIn *Harry Cover*, a French comic book parody of *Harry Potter* by Pierre Veys (later translated into Spanish and English), Hermione appears as Harry Cover's friend Hormone.[92] Hermione also appears in *Potter Puppet Pals* sketches by Neil Cicierega; and in the *A Very Potter Musical*, *A Very Potter Sequel*, and *A Very Potter Senior Year* musicals by StarKid Productions played by Bonnie Gruesen in the first two and Meredith Stepien in the third.\n\n\nHermione is the focus of the fan-created web-series, *Hermione Granger and the Quarter Life Crisis*.\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The scene in which Hermione solves the puzzle during the entrance to the Philosopher's Stone was not included in the movie.\n\n## Bibliography[edit]\n\n\n*Page numbers are shown as (UK/US) where applicable*\n* Rowling, J. K.

K. Rowling's *Harry Potter* series. She first appears in the novel *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone* (1997), on the Hogwarts express as a first year student on her way to Hogwarts. After Harry and Ron save her from a mountain troll in the girls' restroom, she becomes best friends with them and often uses her quick wit, deft recall, and encyclopaedic knowledge to lend aid in dire situations. Rowling has stated that Hermione resembles herself as a young girl, with her insecurity and fear of failure.[2]\n\n\nThe character has had immense popularity. The version of Hermione portrayed by Emma Watson in all eight *Harry Potter* films from *Philosopher's Stone* in 2001 to *Deathly Hallows – Part 2* in 2011 was voted the best female character of all time in a poll conducted amongst Hollywood professionals by *The Hollywood Reporter* in 2016.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## Character development[edit]\n\n\nHermione is a Muggle-born Gryffindor,[4] who becomes best friends with Harry Potter and Ron Weasley. Rowling states that she was born on 19 September 1979[2] and she was nearly twelve when she first attended Hogwarts.[5] She is an overachiever who excels academically and is described by Rowling as a \"very logical, upright and good\" character.[6] Rowling adds that Hermione's parents, two Muggle dentists, are a bit bemused by their odd daughter but \"quite proud of her all the same\".[6] They are well aware of the wizard world and have visited Diagon Alley with her.[7] Hermione is an only child.[6] But Rowling revealed in a 2004 interview that Hermione was originally intended to have a sister, but the planned sibling did not appear since she felt it \"might be too late now\" to introduce the character.[8] Rowling has called the character of Luna Lovegood the \"anti-Hermione\" as they are so very different.[9]\n\n\nRowling said the character of Hermione has several autobiographic influences: \"I did not set out to make Hermione like me but she is a bit like me. She is an exaggeration of how I was when I was younger.\"[6] She recalled being called a \"little know-it-all\" in her youth.[2] And she says that not unlike herself, \"there is a lot of insecurity and a great fear of failure\" beneath Hermione's swottiness. Finally, according to Rowling, next to Albus Dumbledore, Hermione is the perfect expository character; because of her encyclopedic knowledge, she can always be used as a plot dump to explain the *Harry Potter* universe.[10] Rowling also states that her feminist conscience is rescued by Hermione, \"who's the brightest witch of her age\" and a \"very strong female character.\"[11]\n\n\nHermione's first name is taken from a character in William Shakespeare's *The Winter's Tale*, though Rowling has said that the two characters have little to nothing in common.[12] Rowling said that she wanted her name to be unusual since if fewer girls had the name, fewer girls would get teased for it and it seemed the sort of name that \"a pair of professional dentists, who liked to prove how clever they were\" would give their daughter.[12] Her original surname was \"Puckle\", but Rowling felt the name \"did not suit her at all\", and so the less frivolous Granger was used.[2]\n\n\n\n## *Harry Potter* books[edit]\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*[edit]\n\n\nHermione first appears in *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone* when she meets Harry and Ron on the Hogwarts Express, where she mocks Ron for his inability to perform a spell to turn his rat yellow. She proves just how much she knows by declaring that she memorized all the textbooks by heart. She constantly annoys her peers with her knowledge, so Harry and Ron initially consider her arrogant, especially after she criticises Ron's incantation of the *Levitation* Charm.[13] They heartily dislike her until they rescue her from a troll, for which she is so thankful that she lies to protect them from punishment, thus winning their friendship.[14] Hermione's knack for logic later enables the trio to solve a puzzle that is essential to retrieving the Philosopher's Stone, and she defeats the constrictive Devil's Snare plant by summoning a jet of \"bluebell flame\".[15][a]\n\n\nHermione is the brains behind the plan to enter the place where the Stone is hidden. She responds to Harry's wariness of Professor Severus Snape and is also suspicious of him. She reveals to Harry and Ron that she does a lot of research in the library, which helped her defeat the Devil's Snare and work out the logic of the potions.\n\n\nRowling said on her website that she resisted her editor's requests to remove the troll scene, stating \"Hermione is so very arrogant and annoying in the early part of *Philosopher's Stone* that I really felt it needed something (literally) huge to bring her together with Harry and Ron.\"[2]\n\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets*[edit]\n\n\nHermione (along with Ron's mother Molly Weasley and a few female students of Hogwarts) develops a liking for Defence Against the Dark Arts (DADA) teacher Gilderoy Lockhart as he had written all the books required for the DADA in *Chamber of Secrets*.[16] During a morning confrontation between the Gryffindor and Slytherin Quidditch teams, a brawl nearly ensues after Draco Malfoy calls her a \"Mudblood\", an insulting epithet for Muggle-born wizards when she defends the Gryffindor Quidditch team. She concocts the Polyjuice Potion needed for the trio to disguise themselves as Draco's housemates to collect information about the Heir of Slytherin who has reopened the Chamber of Secrets. However, she is unable to join Harry and Ron in the investigation after the hair plucked from the robes of Slytherin student Millicent Bulstrode (with whom Hermione was previously matched up during Lockhart's ill-fated Duelling Club) was that of her cat, whose appearance she takes on in her human form; it takes several weeks for the effects to completely wear off. Hermione is Petrified by the basilisk after successfully identifying the creature through library research. Though she lies incapacitated in the hospital wing, the information she has found and left behind is crucial to Harry and Ron in their successful mission to solve the mystery of the Chamber of Secrets. Hermione is revived after Harry kills the basilisk, but she is distraught to learn that all end-of-year exams have been cancelled as a school treat.[17]\n\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban*[edit]\n\n\nHermione buys a cat named Crookshanks, who takes to chasing Ron's pet rat, Scabbers.[18] Before the start of term, Professor Minerva McGonagall secretly gives Hermione a Time-Turner, a device which lets her go back in time and handle her heavy class schedule, though this is not revealed until the penultimate chapter. Much tension comes into play between Hermione and her two best friends; Harry is furious with her because she told McGonagall that he got a Firebolt, which was confiscated to be inspected for traces of dark magic. Ron is angry because he feels Crookshanks caused Scabbers' disappearance, while Hermione fiercely maintains that Crookshanks is innocent.\n\n\nWhile filling in for Remus Lupin in one DADA class, Snape labels Hermione \"an insufferable know-it-all\" and penalises Gryffindor after she speaks out of turn in her attempt to describe a werewolf when no one else does. She correctly deduces Lupin's secret after completing Snape's homework assignment from the class. Crookshanks proves vital in exposing Scabbers as Peter Pettigrew, an erstwhile friend of James and Lily Potter, who revealed their whereabouts to Voldemort the night of their murders, and was able to wrongly implicate Sirius Black (revealed to be Harry's godfather) in the Potters' deaths.[19][20] The Time-Turner enables Hermione and Harry to rescue Sirius and the hippogriff Buckbeak.[19][20]\n\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire*[edit]\n\n\nHermione is horrified by the cruelty that house-elves suffer, and establishes S.P.E.W., the Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare, as an effort to gain basic rights for them. She is Bulgarian Quidditch prodigy Viktor Krum's date at the Yule Ball of the Triwizard Tournament.[21] The proper pronunciation of her name (*Her-my-oh-nee*) is interjected into the plot when she teaches it to Krum; the best he can do is \"Herm-own-ninny,\" but she has no problem with it.[2] She later gets into a heated argument with Ron after he accuses her of \"fraternising with the enemy\" about her friendship with Krum. In the book, Hermione's feelings toward Ron are hinted at when she says that Ron can't see her \"like a girl,\" but Krum could. She supports Harry through the Triwizard Tournament, helping him prepare for each task. At the end of the second task, Krum asks her to come to see him over the summer in Bulgaria, but she politely declines. Near the end of term, she stops fraudulent tabloid reporter and unregistered Animagus, Rita Skeeter, who had published defamatory material about Hermione, Harry, and Hagrid during the Triwizard Tournament, by holding her Animagus form (a beetle) captive in a jar.[22]\n\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix*[edit]\n\n\nHermione becomes a Gryffindor prefect along with Ron and befriends Luna Lovegood, but their friendship has a rocky start after Hermione chastises the publication of Luna's father: \"*The Quibbler*'s rubbish, everyone knows that.\" She also lambasts housemate Lavender Brown for believing the *Daily Prophet's* allegations of Harry fabricating stories of Voldemort's return. Ron and Hermione spend much of their time bickering, likely due to their growing romantic feelings toward one another, but they show continued loyalty to Harry. One turning point in the series is when Hermione conceives the idea of Harry secretly teaching defensive magic to a small band of students in defiance of the Ministry of Magic's dictum to teach only the subject's basic principles from a textbook, with no hands-on practice. Hermione gets an unexpectedly huge response, and the group becomes the nascent Dumbledore's Army. She is involved in the battle in the Department of Mysteries and seriously injured by a spell from Death Eater Antonin Dolohov, but makes a full recovery.[23][24]\n\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince*[edit]\n\n\nNew Potions professor Horace Slughorn invites Hermione to join his \"Slug Club\",[25] and she helps Ron retain his spot on the Gryffindor Quidditch team when she casts a confund spell on Cormac McLaggen, causing him to miss his last save attempt during Keeper tryouts. Hermione's feelings for Ron continue to grow and she decides to make a move by inviting him to Slughorn's Christmas Party, but he romances Lavender instead in retaliation for his belief that Hermione had kissed Krum years earlier. She attempts to get even by dating Cormac at the Christmas party, but her plan goes awry and she abandons him midway through the party.[26][27] Ron and Hermione continually feud with each other (Ron is upset with her because she set birds to attack him after seeing him and Lavender kissing; Hermione is mostly mad because of her growing jealousy) until he suffers a near-fatal poisoning from tainted mead, which frightens her enough to reconcile with him. After Dumbledore's death, Ron and Hermione both vow to stay by Harry's side regardless what happens.[28] A minor subplot in the book is that Hermione and Harry form a rivalry in Potions, as Hermione is used to coming first in her subjects and is angry that Harry outperforms her undeservedly by following tips and different instructions written in the margins of Harry's potions book by the previous owner. Hermione is also the only one of the trio to successfully pass her Apparition test (Ron failed, albeit barely, and Harry was too young).\n\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows*[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hermione carrying Dobby's corpse.\nIn the seventh and last book, Hermione accompanies Harry on his quest to destroy Voldemort's remaining Horcruxes. Before leaving on the quest, she helps ensure the safety of her parents by placing a false memory charm on them, making them think they are Wendell and Monica Wilkins, whose lifetime ambition is to move to Australia. She inherits Dumbledore's copy of *The Tales of Beedle the Bard*, which allows her to decipher some secrets of the Deathly Hallows. She prepared for their departure and journey by placing an Undetectable Extension Charm on a small beaded purse so she can fill the infinite depths of the bag with things they will need. Hermione's spell saves her and Harry from Lord Voldemort and his snake Nagini in Godric's Hollow, though the ricochet snaps Harry's wand. When she, Ron, and Harry are caught by Snatchers, who are hunting for Muggle-borns under the Ministry's orders, Hermione disguises Harry by temporarily disfiguring his face with a Stinging Jinx. She also tries to pass herself off as former Hogwarts student Penelope Clearwater and a half-blood to avoid persecution, but they are recognised and taken to Malfoy Manor. Bellatrix Lestrange tortures her with a Cruciatus Curse in an attempt to extract information on how Hermione, Harry, and Ron came to possess Godric Gryffindor's sword (which was supposed to be safe in the Lestrange vault at Gringotts). Bellatrix orders for Griphook the goblin to inspect the sword and tell whether it is fake or real. To save Hermione, Harry convinces him to lie to Bellatrix that the sword is a fake. When the others escape their cell, Bellatrix threatens to slit Hermione's throat. Hermione, Harry, Ron and the other prisoners being held in Malfoy Manor are eventually rescued by Dobby.\n\n\nHermione later uses Polyjuice Potion to impersonate Bellatrix when the trio steal Hufflepuff's cup (a Horcrux) from Gringotts. She, Harry, and Ron join Dumbledore's Army in the Battle of Hogwarts, during which Hermione destroys Hufflepuff's cup in the Chamber of Secrets with a basilisk fang. Hermione and Ron also share their first kiss during the battle.[29] In the final battle in the Great Hall, Hermione fights Bellatrix with the help of Ginny Weasley and Luna. However, the three of them are unable to defeat Bellatrix and stop fighting her once Molly Weasley orders them to disengage.[30]\n\n\n\n#### Epilogue[edit]\n\n\nIn the epilogue of *Deathly Hallows*, which is set nineteen years after Voldemort's death, Hermione and Ron have two children: Rose Granger-Weasley, whom they are sending off to her first year at Hogwarts, and a younger son named Hugo.[DH Ch.37] Though the epilogue does not explicitly say Hermione and Ron are married,[31] news articles and other sources treat it as fact.[32][33][34]\n\n\n\n## In other material[edit]\n\n\nIn *Harry Potter and the Cursed Child*, it is shown that Hermione has become Minister for Magic, succeeding Kingsley Shacklebolt.\n\n\n\n## Characterisation[edit]\n\n\n### Appearance[edit]\n\n\nThe books describe Hermione as having \"bushy brown hair\"[35][36][37] and brown eyes.[38] Her front buck teeth, already very large,[35][37] grow uncontrollably in *Goblet of Fire* after she is affected by a spell cast by Draco Malfoy.[39] Madam Pomfrey attends to her in the hospital wing and, at her request, shrinks the teeth down to a normal size that matches her mouth.[40] In the films, her hair is less bushy[41] and she always has regular teeth except for a scene at the end of *Philosopher's Stone* where Emma Watson wore fake teeth. She stopped wearing them for the rest of the films because they caused difficulties in speech.[42]\n\n\nThere is controversy[43] over whether Hermione's skin colour is ever categorically established in the books. Some take as proof a line from *Prisoner of Azkaban*: \"Hermione's white face was sticking out from behind a tree.\"[44] They interpret this as a direct description of her skin tone. Others interpret it as a description relative to her usual complexion, arising due to fright and anxiety as she watches Harry Potter's attempt to save the hippogriff Buckbeak from execution. J.K. Rowling herself says Hermione \"turned white\" in that she \"lost colour from her face after a shock.\"[43]\n\n\nAnother description from early in *Prisoner of Azkaban* is: \"They were there, both of them, sitting outside Florean Fortescue's Ice-Cream Parlour, Ron looking incredibly freckly, Hermione very brown, both waving frantically at him.\"[45] Some claim this is a direct description of her skin colour, while others claim it's a relative description of the results of a tan acquired over the summer break.[46]\n\n\n\n### Personality[edit]\n\n\nHermione's most prominent features include her prodigious intellect and cleverness. She is levelheaded, book-smart, and always very logical. Throughout the series, Hermione uses the skills of a librarian and teacher to gather the information needed to defeat Voldemort, the \"Dark Lord\". When in doubt, she always turns to the school library.[47] She is often bossy yet unfailingly dutiful and loyal to her friends—a person who can always be counted on. J.K. Rowling said that Hermione \"never strays off the path; she always keeps her attention focused on the job that must be done.\"[48] Despite Hermione's intelligence and bossy attitude, Rowling says Hermione has \"quite a lot of vulnerability in her personality,\"[49] as well as a \"sense of insecurity underneath,\" feels, \"utterly inadequate... and to compensate, she tries and strives to be the best at everything at school, projecting a confidence that irritates people.\"[50] During her DADA exam at the end of *Prisoner of Azkaban*, Hermione reveals that her biggest fear is failure after a Boggart takes the form of Professor McGonagall and tells her that she has failed all her exams.[51]\n\n\nHermione is extremely compassionate; and very quick to help others, especially the defenceless, such as Neville Longbottom, first-years, House-Elves, fellow Muggle-borns, half-giants like Hagrid, and werewolves like Lupin. After publication of the last book, J.K. Rowling revealed that Hermione's career in the Ministry was to fight for the rights of the oppressed and disenfranchised (such as House-elves or Muggle-borns). Hermione is also very protective of her friends and values them so much that Rowling has suggested that, if Hermione looked in the Mirror of Erised, she would see Harry, Ron, and herself alive and Voldemort defeated.[52] Hermione also learns to ignore what bullies such as Draco Malfoy say to her, often preventing Harry and Ron from retaliating and thinking of some way to outsmart him. She accepts her status as a Muggle-born, and says in *Deathly Hallows* that she is \"a Mudblood and proud of it\".[53]\n\n\n\n### Magical abilities and skills[edit]\n\n\nHermione is portrayed during the whole series as an exceptionally talented young witch. J.K. Rowling has said that Hermione is a \"borderline genius.\"[54] She got ten O.W.L.s, which were nine Outstanding and one Exceeds Expectations. She is the best student in Harry's year and is repeatedly the first student to master any spell or charm introduced in her classes and even from more advanced years, as evidenced when she can conjure a Protean Charm on the D.A.'s fake Galleon coins, which is a N.E.W.T. level charm.[55] She is also the first one of her age to be able to cast non-verbal spells.[56] Hermione is a competent duellist – Rowling has stated that during the first three books Hermione could have beaten Harry in any magical duel, but by the fourth book Harry had become so good at DADA that he would have defeated Hermione.[57] Hermione did not tend to do as well in subjects that were not learned through books or formal training, as broom flying did not come as naturally to her in her first year as it did to Harry,[58] and she showed no affinity for Divination, which she dropped from her third-year studies.[59][60] She was also not good at Wizard's Chess, as it was the only thing at which she ever lost to Ron.[61]\n\n\nHermione's Patronus is an otter, Rowling's favourite animal. In the *Deathly Hallows* book, while they enter the Ministry of Magic under disguise, Hermione impersonates Mafalda Hopkirk. Her wand is made of vine wood and dragon heartstring core; vine is the wood ascribed to Hermione's fictional birth month (September) on the Celtic calendar.[62]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\nHermione is viewed by many as a feminist icon.[63] In *The Ivory Tower and Harry Potter,* the first book-length analysis of the *Harry Potter* series (edited and compiled by Lana A. Whited), a chapter titled \"Hermione Granger and the Heritage of Gender\" by Eliza T. Dresang, discusses Hermione's role in the series and its relation to feminist debates.[64] The chapter begins with an analysis of Hermione's name and the role of previous characters with the same name in mythology and fiction, and the heritage Hermione has inherited from these characters due to her name. Dresang also emphasises Hermione's parallelism with Rowling herself and how, as Hermione has some attributes from Rowling herself, she must be a strong character.\n\n\nThe chapter also points out that, despite being born to Muggle parents, Hermione's magical abilities are innate. Her \"compulsion for study\" helps both the character's development, which makes Hermione \"a prime example that information brings power\", and the plot of the series, as her knowledge of the wizard world is often used to \"save the day\". Dresang states that \"Harry and Ron are more dependent on Hermione than she is on them.\" However, she adds that Hermione's \"hysteria and crying happen far too often to be considered a believable part of the development of Hermione's character and are quite out of line with her core role in the book.\"[64]\n\n\nUGO Networks listed Hermione as one of their best heroes of all time, saying, \"Most of us can probably recall having a classmate like Hermione when we were in grammar school\"—one who \"can at first be a little off-putting, but once you get to know her, she's not a bad chick to have on your side\".[65] *IGN* also listed Hermione as their second top *Harry Potter* character, praising her character development.[66] In 2016 *The Hollywood Reporter* did a poll of Hollywood professionals, including actors, writers and directors, into their favourite female characters of all time; Hermione topped the poll.[3]\n\n\nPhilip Nel of Kansas State University notes that \"Rowling, who worked for Amnesty International, evokes her social activism through Hermione's passion for oppressed elves and the formation of her 'Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare'\".[67] Scholars such as Brycchan Carey have praised the books' abolitionist sentiments, viewing Hermione's Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare as a model for younger readers' political engagement.[68][69]\n\n\nHowever, in an analysis for *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows*, Rowland Manthrope states that \"seven books on, we still only know her as swottish, sensible Hermione—a caricature, not a character.\"[70]\n\n\n\n## Portrayals[edit]\n\n\n### Film series[edit]\n\n\nEmma Watson played Hermione in all eight *Harry Potter* films. Watson's Oxford theatre teacher passed her name on to the casting agents of *Philosopher's Stone*, impressed with her school play performances.[71][*failed verification*] Though Watson took her audition seriously, she \"never really thought she had any chance\" of getting the part.[72] The producers were impressed by Watson's self-confidence and she outperformed the thousands of other girls who applied.[73]\n\n\nRowling herself was supportive of Watson after her first screen test.[71] When asked if she thought actors suited the characters, Rowling said, \"Yes, I did. Emma Watson in particular was very, very like Hermione when I first spoke to her, I knew she was perfect from that first phone call.\"[8]\n\n\nWatson was well-received for the first film; IGN even commented that \"from Hermione Granger's perfect introduction to her final scene, Watson is better than I could have possibly imagined. She steals the show.\"[74] IGN also wrote that her \"astute portrayal of Hermione has already become a favourite among fans.\"[75]\n\n\nBefore the production of *Half-Blood Prince*, Watson considered not returning,[76] but eventually decided that \"the pluses outweighed the minuses\" and that she could not bear to see anyone else play Hermione.[77]\n\n\nWatson has said that Hermione is a character who makes \"brain not beauty cool,\" and that though Hermione is \"slightly socially inept,\" she is \"not ashamed of herself.\"[78] When filming *Chamber of Secrets*, Watson was \"adamant\" that she wasn't like Hermione, but she reflects that \"as I got older, I realised she was the greatest role model a girl could have.\"[79] In 2007, before the release of *Order of the Phoenix,* Watson said, \"There are too many stupid girls in the media. Hermione's not scared to be clever. I think sometimes really smart girls dumb themselves down a bit, and that's bad. When I was nine or ten, I would get really upset when they tried to make me look geeky, but now I absolutely love it. I find it's so much pressure to be beautiful. Hermione doesn't care what she looks like. She's a complete tomboy.\"[77]\n\n\nScreenwriter Steve Kloves revealed in a 2003 interview that Hermione was his favourite character. \"There's something about her fierce intellect coupled with a complete lack of understanding of how she affects people sometimes that I just find charming and irresistible to write.\"[10]\n\n\n\n### Theatre[edit]\n\n\nIn *Harry Potter and the Cursed Child*, Hermione is played by Eswatini-born actress Noma Dumezweni, known for her work in *Linda*, *A Raisin in the Sun* and *A Human Being Died That Night*.[80] Dumezweni described the role as a \"privilege and a responsibility\" and said that \"we all aspire to be Hermione.\"[81] The choice of a black actress to play her, led to criticism on social media, which J.K. Rowling described as being by \"a bunch of racists\", adding that the books never explicitly mention her race or skin tone (though she did write in *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban*, \"Hermione's white face was sticking out from behind a tree.\"[44]) and that she has been portrayed as black in fan art.[43] Dumezweni herself called the backlash \"so unimaginative\",[82] stating that \"So many young actors and actresses have told me that they’re so pleased I’m playing Hermione because they can see a version of themselves on the stage.\"[83]\n\n\nDumezweni got praise for her performance; *The Independent* said that she \"did a tremendous job as the stern witch.\"[84] At the 2017 Laurence Olivier Awards, Dumezweni got the Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role for her portrayal of Hermione.[83]\n\n\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\n\nHermione has been parodied in many sketches and animated series. On *Saturday Night Live*, Lindsay Lohan played Hermione.[85] On his show *Big Impression*, Alistair McGowan did a sketch, \"Louis Potter and the Philosopher's Scone\". It featured impressions of Nigella Lawson as Hermione.[86] In 2003, Comic Relief performed a spoof story called *Harry Potter and the Secret Chamberpot of Azerbaijan*, in which Miranda Richardson, who plays Rita Skeeter in the Harry Potter films, featured as Hermione.[87][88] Hermione also features in the *Harry Bladder* sketches in *All That*, where she appears as Herheiny and is played by Lisa Foiles. *The Wedge*, an Australian sketch comedy, parodies Hermione and Harry in love on a *\"Cooking With...\"* show before being caught by Snape.[89] Hermione also appears as Hermione Ranger in *Harry Podder: Dude Where's My Wand?*, a play by Desert Star Theater in Utah, written by sisters Laura J., Amy K. and Anna M. Lewis.[90][91] In the 2008 American comedy film *Yes Man*, Allison (played by Zooey Deschanel) accompanies Carl (Jim Carrey) to a Harry Potter-themed party dressed as Hermione.\n\n\nIn *Harry Cover*, a French comic book parody of *Harry Potter* by Pierre Veys (later translated into Spanish and English), Hermione appears as Harry Cover's friend Hormone.[92] Hermione also appears in *Potter Puppet Pals* sketches by Neil Cicierega; and in the *A Very Potter Musical*, *A Very Potter Sequel*, and *A Very Potter Senior Year* musicals by StarKid Productions played by Bonnie Gruesen in the first two and Meredith Stepien in the third.\n\n\nHermione is the focus of the fan-created web-series, *Hermione Granger and the Quarter Life Crisis*.\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The scene in which Hermione solves the puzzle during the entrance to the Philosopher's Stone was not included in the movie.\n\n## Bibliography[edit]\n\n\n*Page numbers are shown as (UK/US) where applicable*\n* Rowling, J. K.

K. Rowling's *Harry Potter* fantasy novel series. His first appearance was in the first book of the series, *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*, as the best friend of Harry Potter and Hermione Granger. He is a member of the Weasley family, a pure blood family that resides in \"The Burrow\" outside Ottery St. Catchpole. Being the only member of the three main characters raised in magical society, he also provides insight into the Wizarding World's magical customs and traditions. Along with Harry and Hermione, he is a member of Gryffindor house and is present for most of the action throughout the series.\n\n\n\n\n## Character development[edit]\n\n\nAccording to Rowling, Ron was among the characters she created on the first day.[1] Ron is inspired by Rowling's best friend Sean Harris (to whom *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets* is dedicated), but she has clearly stated that she \"never set out to describe Sean in Ron, but Ron has a Sean-ish turn of phrase.\"[2] Like Harris is to Rowling, Ron is \"always there\" when Harry needs him. Ron fits many of the stereotypes expected of the sidekick; he is often used as comic relief, is loyal to the hero, and lacks much of the talent Harry possesses, at least, early on, in terms of magical power. However, he proves his bravery and magical ability several times, such as by playing 'real wizard's chess' in the first book, entering into the Forbidden Forest with Harry during the second book despite his arachnophobia, producing a full-corporeal Patronus Charm in the fifth book and even, in the seventh book, getting basilisk fangs from the Chamber of Secrets by mimicking Parseltongue without understanding it.\n\n\nSome of Ron's qualities serve as foils to Harry's. Whereas Harry is an orphan with more gold than he needs, Ron comes from a loving but poor family. Many of his possessions are hand-me-downs. Harry is famous but would prefer to avoid the spotlight; Ron, in comparison, is often perceived as a mere lackey and sometimes becomes jealous of the recognition Harry receives. Overshadowed by his many siblings and the fame and achievements of his friends, Ron's inferiority complex and need to prove himself are the main thrusts of his character arc. As the books progress, he matures from an insecure boy to a competent young man capable of strategy and leadership.\n\n\n\n## Appearances[edit]\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*[edit]\n\n\nRowling first introduces Ron with his family in *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*. Harry is lost at King's Cross railway station, and the Weasleys guide him through the barrier at Platform 9¾ into the wizarding world. Ron and Harry share a compartment on the Hogwarts Express, and they begin their friendship. Ron is fascinated with the famous Harry, and Harry is fascinated with the ordinary Ron. On the train, they both meet Hermione Granger as well, whom they initially dislike but who later becomes their close friend after they save each other during a dangerous encounter with a mountain troll.[PS Ch.6] Ron and Harry share the same classes throughout the series and generally have similar academic successes and disappointments. Ron plays a vital part in the quest to save the Philosopher's Stone. His strategy at Wizard's Chess allows Hermione and Harry to proceed safely through a dangerous, life-sized animated chess game. During the game, Ron allows his piece to be sacrificed and is subsequently knocked unconscious.[PS Ch.16] At the Leaving Feast, the last dinner of the school year, Albus Dumbledore, Hogwarts's Headmaster, awards Ron fifty House points to Gryffindor for \"the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many years.\" These last-minute points help support Gryffindor's securing of the House Cup.[PS Ch.17]\n\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets*[edit]\n\n\nThe second instalment, *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets*, takes place the year following the events of the *Philosopher's Stone*.\nDuring the summer, Ron attempts to write to Harry several times. He receives no reply because Dobby the house elf is stopping Harry's wizard mail. Ron becomes so concerned that he and his brothers Fred and George fly their father's enchanted Ford Anglia car to Harry's home at his aunt and uncle's house. Harry spends the next month at the Weasleys' home, The Burrow. While attempting to depart from King's Cross station, Harry and Ron find themselves unable to enter the barrier to access Platform 9¾. With Harry, Ron conceives the idea of taking the flying Ford Anglia to Hogwarts. The plan is successful, but the Anglia loses power at the end of the journey and crashes into the Whomping Willow. Ron and Harry survive the impact, but Ron's wand is broken in the process, and the car drives itself off into the Forbidden Forest, a forest at the edge of the Hogwarts grounds in which student access is prohibited. Ron receives a Howler from his mother, berating him for taking the car.\n\n\nLater in the novel, Ron and Harry transform themselves using Polyjuice Potion to resemble Draco Malfoy's close associates Crabbe and Goyle, so that they can spy on him, and find out what he knows about the Chamber of Secrets. During the hunt to find the Heir of Slytherin, Ron is responsible for providing the first clue to the identity of Tom Marvolo Riddle, recalling that he saw the name \"T. M. Riddle\" on a trophy inscribed \"For Special Services to the School\". Later Ron is forced to come face-to-face with his worst nightmare, spiders, in the Forbidden Forest, where the two have ventured at Hagrid's suggestion. Giant spiders nearly devour the two of them, but the Weasley Ford Anglia returns from the Forbidden Forest and rescues the pair. Ron and Harry then discover the entrance into the Chamber, and enter it in the hopes of saving Ginny, Ron's sister, who had been kidnapped and kept in the Chamber. Due to an accident with Ron's wand, the Chamber Entrance's ceiling collapses, trapping Ron on one side and Harry on the other. Harry goes on to rescue Ginny and save the day. Ron and Harry are given Special Awards for Services to the School for this, and he receives two hundred points, along with Harry for their success in the Chamber of Secrets.\n\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban*[edit]\n\n\nIn *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban*, Ron's rat, Scabbers, already seen in *Philosopher's Stone*, goes missing, for which he blames Hermione's new cat Crookshanks, and the two have a falling-out.[PoA Ch.11][PoA Ch.12] They eventually make up when Hermione has a nervous breakdown brought by taking too many classes and distress at the fate of the hippogriff Buckbeak. The animal, owned by Hagrid, has been put on trial for injuring Draco and risks execution. Ron offers to help with the preparation of Buckbeak's defence, but this fails to help. Harry, Ron and Hermione go to see Hagrid on the day of the execution where they discover Scabbers hiding in Hagrid's hut.[PoA Ch.15] As they leave, Scabbers struggles free of Ron and runs away. He chases Scabbers to the Whomping Willow where he is grabbed by a large black dog and dragged into a tunnel hidden below the tree.[PoA Ch.16][PoA Ch.17]\n\n\nHarry and Hermione follow the tunnel, which leads to the Shrieking Shack. The dog is actually the animal form of Sirius Black (an Animagus), Harry's godfather and an escaped convict from the wizard prison Azkaban. The school's Defence Against the Dark Arts professor Remus Lupin arrives just after Harry and Hermione. Along with Sirius, Lupin casts a spell on Scabbers, who also turns out to be an Animagus by the name of Peter Pettigrew. Pettigrew was Sirius's, Lupin's, and Harry's father James Potter's school friend, thought to have been murdered by Sirius.[PoA Ch.16][PoA Ch.16] Pettigrew, who had lived as a rat ever since faking his death, denies everything, but Sirius and Lupin piece together that he has been a servant of Voldemort, and it was he who divulged the secret whereabouts of Harry's parents, leading to their murder. Initially, Ron does not believe Sirius and refuses to turn over Scabbers to him, but he is disgusted when he learns his rat's identity. Pettigrew escapes when the main characters lead him out of the Whomping Willow.[PoA Ch.18][PoA Ch.19][PoA Ch.20] Ron, knocked out by a spell from Pettigrew, is taken to the hospital wing, and is forced to remain there while Harry and Hermione travel back in time to save Sirius and Buckbeak.[PoA Ch.21] At the end of the novel, Sirius sends Ron an excitable little owl whom Ginny names Pigwidgeon, but whom Ron refers to as \"Pig\".[PoA Ch.22]\n\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire*[edit]\n\n\nIn *Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire*, the Weasleys invite Harry and Hermione to the Quidditch World Cup. Ron is in awe of his favourite Quidditch champion, Viktor Krum.[GoF Ch.7][GoF Ch.8] Ron is even more excited when Krum, still a student at the Durmstrang wizarding school, comes to Hogwarts to take part in the Triwizard Tournament, a magical wizarding tournament opposing the top three magic schools in Europe.[GoF Ch.12] However, when Harry, underage, mysteriously becomes the fourth Tournament champion, Ron joins the dissenters who think Harry somehow cheated his way into the tournament and feels let down; according to Hermione, this stems from Ron's latent envy caused by being left out of the spotlight shared by Harry or his brothers. The rift is serious enough that the friends fail to make up for nearly a month.[GoF Ch.17] They only reconcile shortly after Harry successfully gets by a fire-breathing dragon in the first task; Ron realises how dangerous the Tournament is and finally believes that Harry did not enter himself.\n\n\nAt Christmas time, as per Triwizard Tournament tradition, Hogwarts hosts a Yule Ball. Ron and Harry panic at the prospect of having to secure dates for the event, and Ron appalls Hermione with his immature approach, particularly for failing to extend her an invitation, apparently failing until the last minute to even realise she is a girl. At the last minute, Harry saves the day by getting Parvati Patil and her sister Padma to agree to come with the duo, although Padma seems less than pleased at Ron's surly attitude and shabby dress. Ron becomes overcome with jealousy when he sees Hermione with her date: his former idol Krum. When Hermione comes over to Ron and Harry for a friendly chat, Ron loses control and accuses her of \"fraternising with the enemy\" and giving away Harry's Triwizard secrets. At the evening's end, the two have a heated row, in which Hermione tells Ron he should have asked her before Krum, rather than simply hoping to secure her by default.[GoF Ch.23] Ron completely fails to get the hint and remains either in denial or oblivious to the pair's increasingly obvious feelings for each other. Ron's jealousy over Krum is mirrored by Hermione's dislike of Fleur Delacour (of the Beauxbatons Academy and a Triwizard competitor), on whom Ron has an obvious crush.[GoF Ch.22]\n\n\nIn the Second Task of the Tournament, Ron is the person selected for Harry to rescue from the depths of the Hogwarts Lake, as he is the one whom Harry would most miss. Harry successfully saves him and Ron mocks him gently for thinking that the hostages for the task were in actual danger.[GoF Ch.26]\n\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix*[edit]\n\n\nIn *Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix*, Ron is appointed a Gryffindor prefect, much to the surprise of himself and everyone else, especially Hermione, the other new prefect.[OotP Ch.9] His brother, Percy, now distant and disconnected from the family, sends Ron an owl congratulating him and advising him to \"sever ties\" with Harry and side himself instead with Dolores Umbridge, the abominable new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts; the letter angers Ron.[OotP Ch.14] Ron explicitly shows his support and loyalty for Harry when his classmates imply Harry is lying about the return of Voldemort, sometimes using his power as prefect to threaten them into silence.[OotP Ch.15] Though they spend their usual amount of time bickering, Ron and Hermione present a united front endorsing Harry. Ron supports Hermione's suggestion of Harry teaching students practical Defence Against the Dark Arts, which Umbridge, using the Ministry of Magic to slowly take over the Dumbledore-run school, has all but banned. He co-founds the secret students' group called Dumbledore's Army.[OotP Ch.15] He also joins the Gryffindor Quidditch team as Keeper, but his nerves and confidence issues often get the better of him during practices and matches, causing the Slytherins to make up a song about how Ron will make sure Slytherin win the interhouse Quidditch Cup. However, during the last match, Ron plays better and wins the game and the Quidditch Cup for Gryffindor. At the climax of the novel, Ron battles the Death Eaters alongside Harry, Hermione, Ginny, Neville Longbottom and Luna Lovegood at the Department of Mysteries. He is injured in the fight, but makes a full recovery by the end of the novel.\n\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince*[edit]\n\n\nIn *Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince* Ron, who has grown taller over the summer, attracts the attention of Lavender Brown. Harry, the new Quidditch Captain, picks Ron to continue as Keeper for the Gryffindor Quidditch team, over competing candidate Cormac McLaggen who is equally-skilled but has difficulty with teamwork and following orders.[HBP Ch.11] Upon learning Hermione most likely had kissed Krum, Ron performs increasingly badly at Quidditch, and thrown off by jealousy of his former idol, becomes unkind to Hermione. His low self-esteem is not helped much by his younger sister Ginny who after Ron reacts badly to finding her kissing her boyfriend, throws in the fact that of those in the group, Ron is the only one who has never had his first kiss. To bolster Ron's confidence, Harry pretends to give him Felix Felicis, a potion which makes the drinker lucky; believing he has actually taken it, Ron performs admirably and Gryffindor wins the match. However, this leads to a major row between Ron and Hermione: Hermione accuses Harry of helping Ron cheat, while Ron berates Hermione for having no faith in his abilities.[HBP Ch.14] At a post-game celebration, Ron kisses Lavender (though Ginny describes it as \"eating her face\"). Hermione, jealous and seeking retaliation, takes McLaggen as her date to new Potions professor Horace Slughorn's Christmas party, but he proves to be an egomaniac.[HBP Ch.15] After Christmas, Hermione continues to ignore Ron, stopping only to give him disdainful looks and occasional snide remarks. By now, Ron is visibly discontent with his relationship with Lavender.[HBP Ch.17]\n\n\nOn his birthday in March, Ron accidentally eats Amortentia-infused Chocolate Cauldrons (actually meant for Harry). After being cured by Slughorn, he then consumes poisoned mead (which Draco Malfoy actually intended for Dumbledore). Harry saves his life by forcing a bezoar, a poison antidote, into his mouth, and Ron is transferred to the hospital wing. A panic-stricken Hermione arrives, forgetting her past anger. While sitting by his bed, Hermione, Harry, Ginny and the twins hear Ron mutter Hermione's name in his delirium, although they do not hear what he is saying and ignore it. Conversely, Ron feigns sleep when Lavender visits him. Upon recovering, Ron and Hermione reconcile,[HBP Ch.18][HBP Ch.19][HBP Ch.20] and a little while later, Ron and Lavender break up. Rowling in an interview said that she \"really enjoyed writing the Ron/Lavender business, and the reason that was enjoyable was Ron up to this point has been quite immature compared to the other two, and he kind of needed to make himself worthy of Hermione....he had to grow up emotionally and now he's taken a big step up.\"[3]\n\n\nInitially, Ron does not support Harry's belief that Draco Malfoy is a Death Eater, a follower of Voldemort, but is later convinced. Before leaving Hogwarts with Dumbledore to recover a Horcrux Harry arranges for Ron, Hermione, and Ginny—together with any of Dumbledore's Army they can summon—to keep a close watch on Malfoy and Snape. Harry also provides them with the remains of his vial of Felix Felicis, to aid them in the effort.[HBP Ch.25] Despite the D.A.'s watch, Malfoy provides the Death Eaters entrance into Hogwarts, and a battle ensues. Thanks to Felix Felicis, Ron, Hermione and Ginny are unharmed by the Death Eater's hexes during the battle.[HBP Ch.29] Snape kills Dumbledore during the battle when Malfoy proves that he is unable to.[HBP Ch.27] During his funeral, Ron comforts a weeping Hermione. Ron and Hermione vow to help Harry find and destroy the Horcruxes and kill Voldemort, even if it means leaving Hogwarts.[HBP Ch.30]\n\n\nAttention is drawn several times to Ron's deepening relationships to Harry and Hermione, with unresolved romantic tension with Hermione being one of the main subplots of the novel (and indeed, the entire series). Furthermore, Harry and Ron's friendship has strengthened to the point where Harry can tell Ron that his Quidditch performance is endangering his membership on the team without either character taking it personally.\n\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows*[edit]\n\n\nRon agrees to go with Harry and Hermione on the quest to destroy all of Voldemort's Horcruxes. Worried that the Ministry, now taken over by Voldemort, will learn he is with Harry on a quest, Ron dresses the family ghoul up in pyjamas and spreads the story he is ill with \"spattergroit\", a type of highly contagious magical illness. Ron disguises himself as Reginald Cattermole as the trio attempts to find the locket Horcrux in the possession of Dolores Umbridge.\n\n\nHarry decides he wants someone to wear the Horcrux at all times, fearing it might be lost or stolen. This has a much more profound effect on Ron than it seems to have on Hermione or Harry. Ron ends up lashing out in frustration at the lack of comforts and a concrete plan, eventually leaving his friends behind. Distressed over his absence, Harry and Hermione do not even mention his name during the time that he is gone. However, when they finally mention his name, Ron, who had immediately regretted his decision to leave but was captured by Snatchers and then could not return due to Hermione's anti-Death Eater enchantments, was led to Harry's location by unknown magic within the Deluminator he inherited from Dumbledore. Ron dramatically returns by saving Harry from drowning when Harry is attempting to recover Godric Gryffindor's sword from an icy pool. Harry, a sudden believer in the fate created by his return, immediately forgives Ron and insists it must be Ron who uses the sword to destroy Slytherin's locket. However, the portion of Voldemort's soul inside it plays on Ron's insecurities by revealing that Ron thinks he is \"least loved by a mother who craved a daughter\", then showing him a doppelgänger of Harry who tells him that Harry was happier without him and a doppelgänger of Hermione who does not return his affections and is involved instead with Harry. Ron summons his courage and overcomes the spell, destroying the locket, but is visibly shaken until Harry tells him that he regards Hermione as a sister and a friend, nothing more.\n\n\nThe trio are eventually captured by Snatchers, and Bellatrix Lestrange tortures Hermione with the Cruciatus Curse for information. This sends Ron into a panic, and he continually screams and fights with all his effort to save her, despite Harry's instruction that he calm down and think of a better plan. The trio and some other prisoners are rescued by Dobby, but the house-elf is killed by Bellatrix during the escape. Eventually, the trio returns to Hogwarts, hoping to find the last unknown Horcrux shown in Harry's vision. Having lost the Sword of Gryffindor to Griphook the goblin, Ron gets an idea to procure more Basilisk fangs and manages to speak enough Parseltongue to open the Chamber of Secrets, where Hermione destroys the Horcrux in Helga Hufflepuff's cup. He begins to worry about the fate of Hogwarts' elves. Upon hearing this, Hermione drops the basilisk fangs she was carrying and kisses him for the first time. He also takes part in the Battle of Hogwarts, witnessing the death of his brother Fred, and teams up with Neville to defeat Fenrir Greyback.\n\n\n\n#### Epilogue[edit]\n\n\nIn the epilogue of *Deathly Hallows*, which is set nineteen years after Voldemort's death, Ron and Hermione have two children: Rose Granger-Weasley, whom they are sending off to her first year at Hogwarts, and a younger son named Hugo.[DH Ch.37] Though the epilogue does not explicitly say Ron and Hermione are married,[DH Ch.37] news articles and other sources treat it as a fact.[4][5][6] Ron has also passed his Muggle driving test, despite Hermione's apparent belief that he could not do so without Confunding the examiner. (Ron secretly reveals to Harry he actually did Confund the examiner.) He and Harry work for the Ministry of Magic as Aurors, and along with Hermione they have helped to revamp the Ministry; it is far different from the one that existed previously.[7] Before becoming an Auror, Ron joins George at Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes, which becomes a very lucrative business.[8]\n\n\n\n## Characterisation[edit]\n\n\n### Outward appearance[edit]\n\n\nRowling introduces Ron as \"tall, thin and gangling, with freckles, big hands and feet, and a long nose.\"[PS Ch.6] Ron has the trademark red hair of the Weasleys and is indeed one of Harry's tallest schoolmates, even outgrowing some of his older brothers. Rowling states in the novels that Ron has freckles, though Rupert Grint, the actor who plays Ron, has none. Rowling has also stated that Ron has blue eyes.\n\n\n\n### Personality[edit]\n\n\nRon is known for his humour, loyalty, readiness to defend his friends and his love of food. Rowling in an interview described Ron as very funny but insensitive and immature, saying \"There's a lot of immaturity about Ron, and that's where a lot of the humor comes from.\"[9] As his first exercise with the actors who portray the central trio, Alfonso Cuarón, who directed the third film in the series, *Prisoner of Azkaban*, assigned them to write an autobiographical essay about their character, written in the first person, spanning birth to the discovery of the magical world, and including the character's emotional experience. Of Rupert Grint's essay, Cuarón recalls, \"Rupert didn't deliver the essay. When I questioned why he didn't do it, he said, 'I'm Ron; Ron wouldn't do it.' So I said, 'Okay, you do understand your character.'\"[10] Commenting on Ron's character development in the final book, Rowling explained that \"Ron is the most immature of the three main characters, but in part seven he grows up. He was never strong footed, people see him mostly as Harry's friend; his mother had actually wanted a girl and in the last book he finally has to acknowledge his weaknesses. But it's exactly that which makes Ron a man.\"[11]\n\n\n\n### Magical abilities and skills[edit]\n\n\nRon is given his brother Charlie's old, chipped wand, which is made out of ash and has a unicorn hair sticking out of the end. He holds the wand together with Spellotape after nearly breaking it in half at the start of *Chamber of Secrets*, but it malfunctions dreadfully after this, backfiring spells, making strange noises, and emitting objects from the wrong end. Ron's new wand is fourteen inches, willow and unicorn hair, which he procures before the start of his third year at Hogwarts. Ron's talents are rarely shown, but he, like the other DA members, survives a violent encounter with adult Death Eaters in *Order of the Phoenix*, and it is implied that during the Death Eater assault in *Half-Blood Prince* he held his own quite well because he was being helped by Felix Felicis, the good luck potion. In *Deathly Hallows*, Ron loses his original wand, and takes Peter Pettigrew's wand for his own. Following this, Ron begins to demonstrate more aptitude and general knowledge, along with a sudden spurt in maturity after a terrible row with Harry. For a while, he effectively leads the trio in the hunt for the Horcruxes while Harry suffers a major depression.\n\n\nRowling has stated that Ron's Patronus Charm takes the form of a Jack Russell Terrier, \"a really sentimental choice\" as Rowling herself owns a Jack Russell.[12]\n\n\n\n### Family tree[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n*Harry Potter* family tree\n |\n| --- |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |

from the *Harry Potter* film series.\n2. **^** In *Harry Potter and the Cursed Child*, Bellatrix is depicted as having had a secret daughter — Delphini (Delphi) \"The Augurey\" — who claims to also be the daughter of Lord Voldemort.\n |\n\n\n![](image)The Weasley family as shown in *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban*, from left to right: Fred or George, Ron, Charlie, Molly, Arthur, Ginny, Bill, Percy, and George or Fred.\n\nRon was born into the **Weasley family** on 1 March 1980,[13][HBP Ch.18] the sixth of their seven children, and the youngest son. His middle name, Bilius, is the same as that of a deceased uncle. Ron grew up in the family home, The Burrow, near the village of Ottery St Catchpole in Devon. Ron has six siblings: his five older brothers, Bill, Charlie, Percy, twins Fred and George, and a younger sister, Ginny, each with their own distinct personality trait. Ron is often overshadowed by his siblings' accomplishments, but this is shown to be borne out of a lack of belief in himself, rather than a lack of actual talent or skill. Like his brothers, Percy and Bill he is made a Prefect. Like Fred, George and Ginny, he joins the Quidditch team and eventually grows to be an excellent Keeper.\n\n\nThe Weasley family is one of the few remaining pure blood wizarding families, though they were considered \"blood traitors\" for associating with non-pure-bloods. Moreover, they are far from rich, and are looked down upon by snobbish \"old families\" such as the Malfoys. All of the Weasleys have been sorted into Gryffindor House at Hogwarts. All of the Weasley children, except Bill and Percy who both were Head Boy, are known to have played on the Gryffindor Quidditch team, with Charlie being the captain of the team for at least one of his school years. Bill, Charlie, and Ron were also chosen as the prefect of their House. The Weasleys also all work for the Order of the Phoenix, and all are members except for Ron, Percy, and Ginny, who (as of the end of *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows*) are not known to have officially been inducted into the Order. Arthur is distantly related to Sirius Black and is part of the famed Black family, though he and the rest of his immediate family have been considered \"blood traitors\" and are disowned. Other distant relatives include Draco Malfoy, Nymphadora Tonks, and Bellatrix Lestrange.\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\nThe character is highly popular. Ron was chosen by IGN as their third favourite *Harry Potter* character, who said that Ron's status as comic relief made him \"instantly endearing\" and that his frustration and flirtation with Hermione Granger was a \"highlight\".[14] His friendship with Harry is listed as among the best portrayed in literature and film[15] and his friends-to-lovers relationship with Hermione Granger is often referred to as a fan favorite and one of the best pairings in the series.[*citation needed*] However, many fans disapproved of the pairing, and Rowling herself has admitted in a 2014 interview that the relationship was \"a form of wish fulfillment\" and \"that Hermione and Ron would probably need relationship counseling\".[16]\n\n\n\n## Portrayals[edit]\n\n\n### Film series[edit]\n\n\nRupert Grint portrays Ron Weasley in all eight Harry Potter films. He auditioned after seeing a segment on the BBC children's news programme, Newsround, inviting children to send in information about themselves. Grint sent in a photo, a self-written script and a rap, documenting his desire to portray the character.[17]\n\n\nRowling was supportive of the casting, calling Grint \"perfect\" for the role of Ron.[18] Grint's portrayal of the character was critically acclaimed with him receiving a Satellite Award in the category of \"Outstanding New Talent\",[19] and a Young Artist Award for \"Most Promising Young Newcomer\" for his performance in the first film. His performance has often been cited as the best of three main characters.[20]\n\n\n\n### Theatre[edit]\n\n\nIn 2016, British actor Paul Thornley played Ron Weasley in the original London cast of *Harry Potter and the Cursed Child* at the Palace Theatre, London in the West End. He was nominated for Best Supporting Actor in a Play at the 2017 Whatsonstage.com Awards. Thornley reprised his role as Ron Weasley on Broadway at the Lyric Theater in 2018.\n\n\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\n\nRon Weasley has made several appearances in parodies of *Harry Potter* and pop culture:\n\n\nSeth Meyers appeared as Ron in *Saturday Night Live* in the sketch in which Lindsay Lohan portrays Hermione.[21]\n\n\nOn his *The Big Impression* show, Alistair McGowan did a sketch called \"Louis Potter and the Philosopher's Scone\". It featured impressions of Anne Robinson as Ron.[22]\n\n\nIn 2003, Comic Relief performed a spoof story called *Harry Potter and the Secret Chamberpot of Azerbaijan*, in which Jennifer Saunders appeared as both Ron and J. K. Rowling.[23][24]\n\n\nIn *Harry Podder: Dude Where's My Wand?*, a play by Desert Star Theater in Utah, written by sisters Laura J., Amy K. and Anna M. Lewis, Ron appears as \"Ron Sneasley\".[25]\n\n\nIn the *Harry Bladder* sketches in *All That*, Ron appears as ReRon and is played by Bryan Hearne.\n\n\nRon also is a regular character in *Potter Puppet Pals* sketches by Neil Cicierega. In one of the episodes, \"The Mysterious Ticking Noise\", Ron, along with Snape, Harry, Hermione and Dumbledore, is killed by a bomb placed by Voldemort; the episode being the seventeenth most viewed video of all time as of 2008 and the winner for \"Best Comedy\" of the year 2007 at YouTube.[26]\n\n\nIn the 2008 American comedy film *Yes Man*, Carl (portrayed by Jim Carrey) attends a Harry Potter-themed party hosted by Norman (Rhys Darby), in which Norman disguises as Ron.\n\n\nIn *A Very Potter Musical* (2009), *A Very Potter Sequel* (2010) and *A Very Potter Senior Year*, parody musicals by StarKid Productions, Ron was portrayed by Joey Richter.\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Fraser, Lindsay (2001). *Conversations with J.

K. Rowling's *Harry Potter* fantasy novel series. His first appearance was in the first book of the series, *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*, as the best friend of Harry Potter and Hermione Granger. He is a member of the Weasley family, a pure blood family that resides in \"The Burrow\" outside Ottery St. Catchpole. Being the only member of the three main characters raised in magical society, he also provides insight into the Wizarding World's magical customs and traditions. Along with Harry and Hermione, he is a member of Gryffindor house and is present for most of the action throughout the series.\n\n\n\n\n## Character development[edit]\n\n\nAccording to Rowling, Ron was among the characters she created on the first day.[1] Ron is inspired by Rowling's best friend Sean Harris (to whom *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets* is dedicated), but she has clearly stated that she \"never set out to describe Sean in Ron, but Ron has a Sean-ish turn of phrase.\"[2] Like Harris is to Rowling, Ron is \"always there\" when Harry needs him. Ron fits many of the stereotypes expected of the sidekick; he is often used as comic relief, is loyal to the hero, and lacks much of the talent Harry possesses, at least, early on, in terms of magical power. However, he proves his bravery and magical ability several times, such as by playing 'real wizard's chess' in the first book, entering into the Forbidden Forest with Harry during the second book despite his arachnophobia, producing a full-corporeal Patronus Charm in the fifth book and even, in the seventh book, getting basilisk fangs from the Chamber of Secrets by mimicking Parseltongue without understanding it.\n\n\nSome of Ron's qualities serve as foils to Harry's. Whereas Harry is an orphan with more gold than he needs, Ron comes from a loving but poor family. Many of his possessions are hand-me-downs. Harry is famous but would prefer to avoid the spotlight; Ron, in comparison, is often perceived as a mere lackey and sometimes becomes jealous of the recognition Harry receives. Overshadowed by his many siblings and the fame and achievements of his friends, Ron's inferiority complex and need to prove himself are the main thrusts of his character arc. As the books progress, he matures from an insecure boy to a competent young man capable of strategy and leadership.\n\n\n\n## Appearances[edit]\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*[edit]\n\n\nRowling first introduces Ron with his family in *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*. Harry is lost at King's Cross railway station, and the Weasleys guide him through the barrier at Platform 9¾ into the wizarding world. Ron and Harry share a compartment on the Hogwarts Express, and they begin their friendship. Ron is fascinated with the famous Harry, and Harry is fascinated with the ordinary Ron. On the train, they both meet Hermione Granger as well, whom they initially dislike but who later becomes their close friend after they save each other during a dangerous encounter with a mountain troll.[PS Ch.6] Ron and Harry share the same classes throughout the series and generally have similar academic successes and disappointments. Ron plays a vital part in the quest to save the Philosopher's Stone. His strategy at Wizard's Chess allows Hermione and Harry to proceed safely through a dangerous, life-sized animated chess game. During the game, Ron allows his piece to be sacrificed and is subsequently knocked unconscious.[PS Ch.16] At the Leaving Feast, the last dinner of the school year, Albus Dumbledore, Hogwarts's Headmaster, awards Ron fifty House points to Gryffindor for \"the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many years.\" These last-minute points help support Gryffindor's securing of the House Cup.[PS Ch.17]\n\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets*[edit]\n\n\nThe second instalment, *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets*, takes place the year following the events of the *Philosopher's Stone*.\nDuring the summer, Ron attempts to write to Harry several times. He receives no reply because Dobby the house elf is stopping Harry's wizard mail. Ron becomes so concerned that he and his brothers Fred and George fly their father's enchanted Ford Anglia car to Harry's home at his aunt and uncle's house. Harry spends the next month at the Weasleys' home, The Burrow. While attempting to depart from King's Cross station, Harry and Ron find themselves unable to enter the barrier to access Platform 9¾. With Harry, Ron conceives the idea of taking the flying Ford Anglia to Hogwarts. The plan is successful, but the Anglia loses power at the end of the journey and crashes into the Whomping Willow. Ron and Harry survive the impact, but Ron's wand is broken in the process, and the car drives itself off into the Forbidden Forest, a forest at the edge of the Hogwarts grounds in which student access is prohibited. Ron receives a Howler from his mother, berating him for taking the car.\n\n\nLater in the novel, Ron and Harry transform themselves using Polyjuice Potion to resemble Draco Malfoy's close associates Crabbe and Goyle, so that they can spy on him, and find out what he knows about the Chamber of Secrets. During the hunt to find the Heir of Slytherin, Ron is responsible for providing the first clue to the identity of Tom Marvolo Riddle, recalling that he saw the name \"T. M. Riddle\" on a trophy inscribed \"For Special Services to the School\". Later Ron is forced to come face-to-face with his worst nightmare, spiders, in the Forbidden Forest, where the two have ventured at Hagrid's suggestion. Giant spiders nearly devour the two of them, but the Weasley Ford Anglia returns from the Forbidden Forest and rescues the pair. Ron and Harry then discover the entrance into the Chamber, and enter it in the hopes of saving Ginny, Ron's sister, who had been kidnapped and kept in the Chamber. Due to an accident with Ron's wand, the Chamber Entrance's ceiling collapses, trapping Ron on one side and Harry on the other. Harry goes on to rescue Ginny and save the day. Ron and Harry are given Special Awards for Services to the School for this, and he receives two hundred points, along with Harry for their success in the Chamber of Secrets.\n\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban*[edit]\n\n\nIn *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban*, Ron's rat, Scabbers, already seen in *Philosopher's Stone*, goes missing, for which he blames Hermione's new cat Crookshanks, and the two have a falling-out.[PoA Ch.11][PoA Ch.12] They eventually make up when Hermione has a nervous breakdown brought by taking too many classes and distress at the fate of the hippogriff Buckbeak. The animal, owned by Hagrid, has been put on trial for injuring Draco and risks execution. Ron offers to help with the preparation of Buckbeak's defence, but this fails to help. Harry, Ron and Hermione go to see Hagrid on the day of the execution where they discover Scabbers hiding in Hagrid's hut.[PoA Ch.15] As they leave, Scabbers struggles free of Ron and runs away. He chases Scabbers to the Whomping Willow where he is grabbed by a large black dog and dragged into a tunnel hidden below the tree.[PoA Ch.16][PoA Ch.17]\n\n\nHarry and Hermione follow the tunnel, which leads to the Shrieking Shack. The dog is actually the animal form of Sirius Black (an Animagus), Harry's godfather and an escaped convict from the wizard prison Azkaban. The school's Defence Against the Dark Arts professor Remus Lupin arrives just after Harry and Hermione. Along with Sirius, Lupin casts a spell on Scabbers, who also turns out to be an Animagus by the name of Peter Pettigrew. Pettigrew was Sirius's, Lupin's, and Harry's father James Potter's school friend, thought to have been murdered by Sirius.[PoA Ch.16][PoA Ch.16] Pettigrew, who had lived as a rat ever since faking his death, denies everything, but Sirius and Lupin piece together that he has been a servant of Voldemort, and it was he who divulged the secret whereabouts of Harry's parents, leading to their murder. Initially, Ron does not believe Sirius and refuses to turn over Scabbers to him, but he is disgusted when he learns his rat's identity. Pettigrew escapes when the main characters lead him out of the Whomping Willow.[PoA Ch.18][PoA Ch.19][PoA Ch.20] Ron, knocked out by a spell from Pettigrew, is taken to the hospital wing, and is forced to remain there while Harry and Hermione travel back in time to save Sirius and Buckbeak.[PoA Ch.21] At the end of the novel, Sirius sends Ron an excitable little owl whom Ginny names Pigwidgeon, but whom Ron refers to as \"Pig\".[PoA Ch.22]\n\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire*[edit]\n\n\nIn *Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire*, the Weasleys invite Harry and Hermione to the Quidditch World Cup. Ron is in awe of his favourite Quidditch champion, Viktor Krum.[GoF Ch.7][GoF Ch.8] Ron is even more excited when Krum, still a student at the Durmstrang wizarding school, comes to Hogwarts to take part in the Triwizard Tournament, a magical wizarding tournament opposing the top three magic schools in Europe.[GoF Ch.12] However, when Harry, underage, mysteriously becomes the fourth Tournament champion, Ron joins the dissenters who think Harry somehow cheated his way into the tournament and feels let down; according to Hermione, this stems from Ron's latent envy caused by being left out of the spotlight shared by Harry or his brothers. The rift is serious enough that the friends fail to make up for nearly a month.[GoF Ch.17] They only reconcile shortly after Harry successfully gets by a fire-breathing dragon in the first task; Ron realises how dangerous the Tournament is and finally believes that Harry did not enter himself.\n\n\nAt Christmas time, as per Triwizard Tournament tradition, Hogwarts hosts a Yule Ball. Ron and Harry panic at the prospect of having to secure dates for the event, and Ron appalls Hermione with his immature approach, particularly for failing to extend her an invitation, apparently failing until the last minute to even realise she is a girl. At the last minute, Harry saves the day by getting Parvati Patil and her sister Padma to agree to come with the duo, although Padma seems less than pleased at Ron's surly attitude and shabby dress. Ron becomes overcome with jealousy when he sees Hermione with her date: his former idol Krum. When Hermione comes over to Ron and Harry for a friendly chat, Ron loses control and accuses her of \"fraternising with the enemy\" and giving away Harry's Triwizard secrets. At the evening's end, the two have a heated row, in which Hermione tells Ron he should have asked her before Krum, rather than simply hoping to secure her by default.[GoF Ch.23] Ron completely fails to get the hint and remains either in denial or oblivious to the pair's increasingly obvious feelings for each other. Ron's jealousy over Krum is mirrored by Hermione's dislike of Fleur Delacour (of the Beauxbatons Academy and a Triwizard competitor), on whom Ron has an obvious crush.[GoF Ch.22]\n\n\nIn the Second Task of the Tournament, Ron is the person selected for Harry to rescue from the depths of the Hogwarts Lake, as he is the one whom Harry would most miss. Harry successfully saves him and Ron mocks him gently for thinking that the hostages for the task were in actual danger.[GoF Ch.26]\n\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix*[edit]\n\n\nIn *Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix*, Ron is appointed a Gryffindor prefect, much to the surprise of himself and everyone else, especially Hermione, the other new prefect.[OotP Ch.9] His brother, Percy, now distant and disconnected from the family, sends Ron an owl congratulating him and advising him to \"sever ties\" with Harry and side himself instead with Dolores Umbridge, the abominable new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts; the letter angers Ron.[OotP Ch.14] Ron explicitly shows his support and loyalty for Harry when his classmates imply Harry is lying about the return of Voldemort, sometimes using his power as prefect to threaten them into silence.[OotP Ch.15] Though they spend their usual amount of time bickering, Ron and Hermione present a united front endorsing Harry. Ron supports Hermione's suggestion of Harry teaching students practical Defence Against the Dark Arts, which Umbridge, using the Ministry of Magic to slowly take over the Dumbledore-run school, has all but banned. He co-founds the secret students' group called Dumbledore's Army.[OotP Ch.15] He also joins the Gryffindor Quidditch team as Keeper, but his nerves and confidence issues often get the better of him during practices and matches, causing the Slytherins to make up a song about how Ron will make sure Slytherin win the interhouse Quidditch Cup. However, during the last match, Ron plays better and wins the game and the Quidditch Cup for Gryffindor. At the climax of the novel, Ron battles the Death Eaters alongside Harry, Hermione, Ginny, Neville Longbottom and Luna Lovegood at the Department of Mysteries. He is injured in the fight, but makes a full recovery by the end of the novel.\n\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince*[edit]\n\n\nIn *Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince* Ron, who has grown taller over the summer, attracts the attention of Lavender Brown. Harry, the new Quidditch Captain, picks Ron to continue as Keeper for the Gryffindor Quidditch team, over competing candidate Cormac McLaggen who is equally-skilled but has difficulty with teamwork and following orders.[HBP Ch.11] Upon learning Hermione most likely had kissed Krum, Ron performs increasingly badly at Quidditch, and thrown off by jealousy of his former idol, becomes unkind to Hermione. His low self-esteem is not helped much by his younger sister Ginny who after Ron reacts badly to finding her kissing her boyfriend, throws in the fact that of those in the group, Ron is the only one who has never had his first kiss. To bolster Ron's confidence, Harry pretends to give him Felix Felicis, a potion which makes the drinker lucky; believing he has actually taken it, Ron performs admirably and Gryffindor wins the match. However, this leads to a major row between Ron and Hermione: Hermione accuses Harry of helping Ron cheat, while Ron berates Hermione for having no faith in his abilities.[HBP Ch.14] At a post-game celebration, Ron kisses Lavender (though Ginny describes it as \"eating her face\"). Hermione, jealous and seeking retaliation, takes McLaggen as her date to new Potions professor Horace Slughorn's Christmas party, but he proves to be an egomaniac.[HBP Ch.15] After Christmas, Hermione continues to ignore Ron, stopping only to give him disdainful looks and occasional snide remarks. By now, Ron is visibly discontent with his relationship with Lavender.[HBP Ch.17]\n\n\nOn his birthday in March, Ron accidentally eats Amortentia-infused Chocolate Cauldrons (actually meant for Harry). After being cured by Slughorn, he then consumes poisoned mead (which Draco Malfoy actually intended for Dumbledore). Harry saves his life by forcing a bezoar, a poison antidote, into his mouth, and Ron is transferred to the hospital wing. A panic-stricken Hermione arrives, forgetting her past anger. While sitting by his bed, Hermione, Harry, Ginny and the twins hear Ron mutter Hermione's name in his delirium, although they do not hear what he is saying and ignore it. Conversely, Ron feigns sleep when Lavender visits him. Upon recovering, Ron and Hermione reconcile,[HBP Ch.18][HBP Ch.19][HBP Ch.20] and a little while later, Ron and Lavender break up. Rowling in an interview said that she \"really enjoyed writing the Ron/Lavender business, and the reason that was enjoyable was Ron up to this point has been quite immature compared to the other two, and he kind of needed to make himself worthy of Hermione....he had to grow up emotionally and now he's taken a big step up.\"[3]\n\n\nInitially, Ron does not support Harry's belief that Draco Malfoy is a Death Eater, a follower of Voldemort, but is later convinced. Before leaving Hogwarts with Dumbledore to recover a Horcrux Harry arranges for Ron, Hermione, and Ginny—together with any of Dumbledore's Army they can summon—to keep a close watch on Malfoy and Snape. Harry also provides them with the remains of his vial of Felix Felicis, to aid them in the effort.[HBP Ch.25] Despite the D.A.'s watch, Malfoy provides the Death Eaters entrance into Hogwarts, and a battle ensues. Thanks to Felix Felicis, Ron, Hermione and Ginny are unharmed by the Death Eater's hexes during the battle.[HBP Ch.29] Snape kills Dumbledore during the battle when Malfoy proves that he is unable to.[HBP Ch.27] During his funeral, Ron comforts a weeping Hermione. Ron and Hermione vow to help Harry find and destroy the Horcruxes and kill Voldemort, even if it means leaving Hogwarts.[HBP Ch.30]\n\n\nAttention is drawn several times to Ron's deepening relationships to Harry and Hermione, with unresolved romantic tension with Hermione being one of the main subplots of the novel (and indeed, the entire series). Furthermore, Harry and Ron's friendship has strengthened to the point where Harry can tell Ron that his Quidditch performance is endangering his membership on the team without either character taking it personally.\n\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows*[edit]\n\n\nRon agrees to go with Harry and Hermione on the quest to destroy all of Voldemort's Horcruxes. Worried that the Ministry, now taken over by Voldemort, will learn he is with Harry on a quest, Ron dresses the family ghoul up in pyjamas and spreads the story he is ill with \"spattergroit\", a type of highly contagious magical illness. Ron disguises himself as Reginald Cattermole as the trio attempts to find the locket Horcrux in the possession of Dolores Umbridge.\n\n\nHarry decides he wants someone to wear the Horcrux at all times, fearing it might be lost or stolen. This has a much more profound effect on Ron than it seems to have on Hermione or Harry. Ron ends up lashing out in frustration at the lack of comforts and a concrete plan, eventually leaving his friends behind. Distressed over his absence, Harry and Hermione do not even mention his name during the time that he is gone. However, when they finally mention his name, Ron, who had immediately regretted his decision to leave but was captured by Snatchers and then could not return due to Hermione's anti-Death Eater enchantments, was led to Harry's location by unknown magic within the Deluminator he inherited from Dumbledore. Ron dramatically returns by saving Harry from drowning when Harry is attempting to recover Godric Gryffindor's sword from an icy pool. Harry, a sudden believer in the fate created by his return, immediately forgives Ron and insists it must be Ron who uses the sword to destroy Slytherin's locket. However, the portion of Voldemort's soul inside it plays on Ron's insecurities by revealing that Ron thinks he is \"least loved by a mother who craved a daughter\", then showing him a doppelgänger of Harry who tells him that Harry was happier without him and a doppelgänger of Hermione who does not return his affections and is involved instead with Harry. Ron summons his courage and overcomes the spell, destroying the locket, but is visibly shaken until Harry tells him that he regards Hermione as a sister and a friend, nothing more.\n\n\nThe trio are eventually captured by Snatchers, and Bellatrix Lestrange tortures Hermione with the Cruciatus Curse for information. This sends Ron into a panic, and he continually screams and fights with all his effort to save her, despite Harry's instruction that he calm down and think of a better plan. The trio and some other prisoners are rescued by Dobby, but the house-elf is killed by Bellatrix during the escape. Eventually, the trio returns to Hogwarts, hoping to find the last unknown Horcrux shown in Harry's vision. Having lost the Sword of Gryffindor to Griphook the goblin, Ron gets an idea to procure more Basilisk fangs and manages to speak enough Parseltongue to open the Chamber of Secrets, where Hermione destroys the Horcrux in Helga Hufflepuff's cup. He begins to worry about the fate of Hogwarts' elves. Upon hearing this, Hermione drops the basilisk fangs she was carrying and kisses him for the first time. He also takes part in the Battle of Hogwarts, witnessing the death of his brother Fred, and teams up with Neville to defeat Fenrir Greyback.\n\n\n\n#### Epilogue[edit]\n\n\nIn the epilogue of *Deathly Hallows*, which is set nineteen years after Voldemort's death, Ron and Hermione have two children: Rose Granger-Weasley, whom they are sending off to her first year at Hogwarts, and a younger son named Hugo.[DH Ch.37] Though the epilogue does not explicitly say Ron and Hermione are married,[DH Ch.37] news articles and other sources treat it as a fact.[4][5][6] Ron has also passed his Muggle driving test, despite Hermione's apparent belief that he could not do so without Confunding the examiner. (Ron secretly reveals to Harry he actually did Confund the examiner.) He and Harry work for the Ministry of Magic as Aurors, and along with Hermione they have helped to revamp the Ministry; it is far different from the one that existed previously.[7] Before becoming an Auror, Ron joins George at Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes, which becomes a very lucrative business.[8]\n\n\n\n## Characterisation[edit]\n\n\n### Outward appearance[edit]\n\n\nRowling introduces Ron as \"tall, thin and gangling, with freckles, big hands and feet, and a long nose.\"[PS Ch.6] Ron has the trademark red hair of the Weasleys and is indeed one of Harry's tallest schoolmates, even outgrowing some of his older brothers. Rowling states in the novels that Ron has freckles, though Rupert Grint, the actor who plays Ron, has none. Rowling has also stated that Ron has blue eyes.\n\n\n\n### Personality[edit]\n\n\nRon is known for his humour, loyalty, readiness to defend his friends and his love of food. Rowling in an interview described Ron as very funny but insensitive and immature, saying \"There's a lot of immaturity about Ron, and that's where a lot of the humor comes from.\"[9] As his first exercise with the actors who portray the central trio, Alfonso Cuarón, who directed the third film in the series, *Prisoner of Azkaban*, assigned them to write an autobiographical essay about their character, written in the first person, spanning birth to the discovery of the magical world, and including the character's emotional experience. Of Rupert Grint's essay, Cuarón recalls, \"Rupert didn't deliver the essay. When I questioned why he didn't do it, he said, 'I'm Ron; Ron wouldn't do it.' So I said, 'Okay, you do understand your character.'\"[10] Commenting on Ron's character development in the final book, Rowling explained that \"Ron is the most immature of the three main characters, but in part seven he grows up. He was never strong footed, people see him mostly as Harry's friend; his mother had actually wanted a girl and in the last book he finally has to acknowledge his weaknesses. But it's exactly that which makes Ron a man.\"[11]\n\n\n\n### Magical abilities and skills[edit]\n\n\nRon is given his brother Charlie's old, chipped wand, which is made out of ash and has a unicorn hair sticking out of the end. He holds the wand together with Spellotape after nearly breaking it in half at the start of *Chamber of Secrets*, but it malfunctions dreadfully after this, backfiring spells, making strange noises, and emitting objects from the wrong end. Ron's new wand is fourteen inches, willow and unicorn hair, which he procures before the start of his third year at Hogwarts. Ron's talents are rarely shown, but he, like the other DA members, survives a violent encounter with adult Death Eaters in *Order of the Phoenix*, and it is implied that during the Death Eater assault in *Half-Blood Prince* he held his own quite well because he was being helped by Felix Felicis, the good luck potion. In *Deathly Hallows*, Ron loses his original wand, and takes Peter Pettigrew's wand for his own. Following this, Ron begins to demonstrate more aptitude and general knowledge, along with a sudden spurt in maturity after a terrible row with Harry. For a while, he effectively leads the trio in the hunt for the Horcruxes while Harry suffers a major depression.\n\n\nRowling has stated that Ron's Patronus Charm takes the form of a Jack Russell Terrier, \"a really sentimental choice\" as Rowling herself owns a Jack Russell.[12]\n\n\n\n### Family tree[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n*Harry Potter* family tree\n |\n| --- |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |

the daughter of Lord Voldemort.\n |\n\n\n![](image)The Weasley family as shown in *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban*, from left to right: Fred or George, Ron, Charlie, Molly, Arthur, Ginny, Bill, Percy, and George or Fred.\n\nRon was born into the **Weasley family** on 1 March 1980,[13][HBP Ch.18] the sixth of their seven children, and the youngest son. His middle name, Bilius, is the same as that of a deceased uncle. Ron grew up in the family home, The Burrow, near the village of Ottery St Catchpole in Devon. Ron has six siblings: his five older brothers, Bill, Charlie, Percy, twins Fred and George, and a younger sister, Ginny, each with their own distinct personality trait. Ron is often overshadowed by his siblings' accomplishments, but this is shown to be borne out of a lack of belief in himself, rather than a lack of actual talent or skill. Like his brothers, Percy and Bill he is made a Prefect. Like Fred, George and Ginny, he joins the Quidditch team and eventually grows to be an excellent Keeper.\n\n\nThe Weasley family is one of the few remaining pure blood wizarding families, though they were considered \"blood traitors\" for associating with non-pure-bloods. Moreover, they are far from rich, and are looked down upon by snobbish \"old families\" such as the Malfoys. All of the Weasleys have been sorted into Gryffindor House at Hogwarts. All of the Weasley children, except Bill and Percy who both were Head Boy, are known to have played on the Gryffindor Quidditch team, with Charlie being the captain of the team for at least one of his school years. Bill, Charlie, and Ron were also chosen as the prefect of their House. The Weasleys also all work for the Order of the Phoenix, and all are members except for Ron, Percy, and Ginny, who (as of the end of *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows*) are not known to have officially been inducted into the Order. Arthur is distantly related to Sirius Black and is part of the famed Black family, though he and the rest of his immediate family have been considered \"blood traitors\" and are disowned. Other distant relatives include Draco Malfoy, Nymphadora Tonks, and Bellatrix Lestrange.\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\nThe character is highly popular. Ron was chosen by IGN as their third favourite *Harry Potter* character, who said that Ron's status as comic relief made him \"instantly endearing\" and that his frustration and flirtation with Hermione Granger was a \"highlight\".[14] His friendship with Harry is listed as among the best portrayed in literature and film[15] and his friends-to-lovers relationship with Hermione Granger is often referred to as a fan favorite and one of the best pairings in the series.[*citation needed*] However, many fans disapproved of the pairing, and Rowling herself has admitted in a 2014 interview that the relationship was \"a form of wish fulfillment\" and \"that Hermione and Ron would probably need relationship counseling\".[16]\n\n\n\n## Portrayals[edit]\n\n\n### Film series[edit]\n\n\nRupert Grint portrays Ron Weasley in all eight Harry Potter films. He auditioned after seeing a segment on the BBC children's news programme, Newsround, inviting children to send in information about themselves. Grint sent in a photo, a self-written script and a rap, documenting his desire to portray the character.[17]\n\n\nRowling was supportive of the casting, calling Grint \"perfect\" for the role of Ron.[18] Grint's portrayal of the character was critically acclaimed with him receiving a Satellite Award in the category of \"Outstanding New Talent\",[19] and a Young Artist Award for \"Most Promising Young Newcomer\" for his performance in the first film. His performance has often been cited as the best of three main characters.[20]\n\n\n\n### Theatre[edit]\n\n\nIn 2016, British actor Paul Thornley played Ron Weasley in the original London cast of *Harry Potter and the Cursed Child* at the Palace Theatre, London in the West End. He was nominated for Best Supporting Actor in a Play at the 2017 Whatsonstage.com Awards. Thornley reprised his role as Ron Weasley on Broadway at the Lyric Theater in 2018.\n\n\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\n\nRon Weasley has made several appearances in parodies of *Harry Potter* and pop culture:\n\n\nSeth Meyers appeared as Ron in *Saturday Night Live* in the sketch in which Lindsay Lohan portrays Hermione.[21]\n\n\nOn his *The Big Impression* show, Alistair McGowan did a sketch called \"Louis Potter and the Philosopher's Scone\". It featured impressions of Anne Robinson as Ron.[22]\n\n\nIn 2003, Comic Relief performed a spoof story called *Harry Potter and the Secret Chamberpot of Azerbaijan*, in which Jennifer Saunders appeared as both Ron and J. K. Rowling.[23][24]\n\n\nIn *Harry Podder: Dude Where's My Wand?*, a play by Desert Star Theater in Utah, written by sisters Laura J., Amy K. and Anna M. Lewis, Ron appears as \"Ron Sneasley\".[25]\n\n\nIn the *Harry Bladder* sketches in *All That*, Ron appears as ReRon and is played by Bryan Hearne.\n\n\nRon also is a regular character in *Potter Puppet Pals* sketches by Neil Cicierega. In one of the episodes, \"The Mysterious Ticking Noise\", Ron, along with Snape, Harry, Hermione and Dumbledore, is killed by a bomb placed by Voldemort; the episode being the seventeenth most viewed video of all time as of 2008 and the winner for \"Best Comedy\" of the year 2007 at YouTube.[26]\n\n\nIn the 2008 American comedy film *Yes Man*, Carl (portrayed by Jim Carrey) attends a Harry Potter-themed party hosted by Norman (Rhys Darby), in which Norman disguises as Ron.\n\n\nIn *A Very Potter Musical* (2009), *A Very Potter Sequel* (2010) and *A Very Potter Senior Year*, parody musicals by StarKid Productions, Ron was portrayed by Joey Richter.\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Fraser, Lindsay (2001). *Conversations with J.
