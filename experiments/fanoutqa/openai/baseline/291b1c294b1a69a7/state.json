The club won six trophies in a calendar year in 2009, becoming one of only 2 male football teams in the world to win the coveted sextuple, apart from FC Bayern Munich in 2020. FC Barcelona also has professional teams in other sports like FC Barcelona Regal (basketball), FC Barcelona Handbol (handball), FC Barcelona Hoquei (roller hockey), FC Barcelona Ice Hockey (ice hockey), FC Barcelona Futsal (futsal) and FC Barcelona Rugby (rugby union), all at one point winners of the highest national and/or European competitions.

It is the capital and largest city of the autonomous community of Catalonia, as well as the second-most populous municipality of Spain. With a population of 1.6 million within city limits,[7] its urban area extends to numerous neighbouring municipalities within the province of Barcelona and is home to around 4.8 million people,[3] making it the fifth most populous urban area in the European Union after Paris, the Ruhr area, Madrid and Milan.[3] It is one of the largest metropolises on the Mediterranean Sea, located on the coast between the mouths of the rivers Llobregat and Bes\u00f2s, bounded to the west by the Serra de Collserola mountain range.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe development of Barcelona was promoted by two events in 1986: Spanish accession to the European Community, and particularly Barcelona's designation as host city of the 1992 Summer Olympics.[57][58] The process of urban regeneration has been rapid, and accompanied by a greatly increased international reputation of the city as a tourist destination. The increased cost of housing has led to a slight decline (\u221216.6%) in the population over the last two decades of the 20th century as many families move out into the suburbs. This decline has been reversed since 2001, as a new wave of immigration (particularly from Latin America and from Morocco) has gathered pace.[59]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1900, almost a third (28.9 percent) of the population were children (aged younger than 14 years). In 2017, this age group constituted only 12.7% of the population. In 2017, people aged between 15 and 24 years made up 9 percent of the population; those aged between 25 and 44 years made up 30.6 percent of the population; while those aged between 45 and 64 years formed 56.9% of all Barcelonans. In 1900, people aged 65 and older made up just 6.5 percent of the population. In 2017, this age group made up 21.5 percent of the population.[80][81]\n\n\n\n### Migration[edit]\n\n\n\n\nLargest groups of foreign residents in Barcelona[82]\n| Nationality | Population(2019) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Italy | 36,276\n |\n| China | 21,658\n |\n| Pakistan | 20,643\n |\n| France | 16,940\n |\n| Morocco | 14,418\n |\n| Colombia | 12,290\n |\n| Honduras | 11,744\n |\n| Peru | 10,558\n |\n| Venezuela | 10,185\n |\n| Philippines | 9,439\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Ajuntament de Barcelona\".

Less well known is that the city industrialised early, taking off in 1833, when Catalonia's already sophisticated textile industry began to use steam power. It became the first and most important industrial city in the Mediterranean basin. Since then, manufacturing has played a large role in its history.\n\n\nBorsa de Barcelona (Barcelona Stock Exchange) is the main stock exchange in the northeastern part of the Iberian Peninsula.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe result was a large-scale immigration from poorer regions of Spain (particularly Andalusia, Murcia and Galicia), which in turn led to rapid urbanisation.\n\n\n\n### Late twentieth century[edit]\n\n\nIn 1992, Barcelona hosted the Summer Olympics. The after-effects of this are credited with driving major changes in what had, up until then, been a largely industrial city. As part of the preparation for the games, industrial buildings along the sea-front were demolished and 3\u00a0km (2\u00a0mi) of beach were created. New construction increased the road capacity of the city by 17%, the sewage handling capacity by 27% and the amount of new green areas and beaches by 78%. Between 1990 and 2004, the number of hotel rooms in the city doubled. Perhaps more importantly, the outside perception of the city was changed making, by 2012, Barcelona the 12th most popular city destination in the world and the 5th amongst European cities.[50][51][52][53][54]\n\n\n\n### Recent history[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2016, about 59% of the inhabitants of the city were born in Catalonia and 18.5% coming from the rest of the country. In addition to that, 22.5% of the population was born outside of Spain, a proportion which has more than doubled since 2001 and more than quintupled since 1996 when it was 8.6% respectively 3.9%.[75]\n\n\nThe most important region of origin of migrants is Europe, with many coming from Italy (26,676) or France (13,506).[75] Moreover, many migrants come from Latin American nations such as Bolivia, Ecuador or Colombia. Since the 1990s, and similar to other migrants, many Latin Americans have settled in northern parts of the city.[83]\n\n\nThere exists a relatively large Pakistani community in Barcelona with up to twenty thousand nationals. The community consists of significantly more men than women. Many of the Pakistanis are living in Ciutat Vella. First Pakistani migrants came in the 1970s, with increasing numbers in the 1990s.[84]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Estadi Ol\u00edmpic de Montju\u00efc (Barcelona Olympic Stadium) built for the 1936 Summer Olympics named *People's Olympiad*, main stadium of 1992 Summer Olympics\n![](image)The Camp Nou, the largest stadium in Europe\nBarcelona has a long sporting tradition and hosted the highly successful 1992 Summer Olympics as well as several matches during the 1982 FIFA World Cup (at the two stadiums).

He notes that they pirate electricity, internet and water allowing them to live on less than one euro a day.

The 2004 Universal Forum of Cultures left the city a large concrete bathing zone on the eastmost part of the city's coastline.

Barcelona also is home to the Barcelona Symphony and Catalonia National Orchestra (Orquestra Simf\u00f2nica de Barcelona i Nacional de Catalunya, usually known as OBC), the largest symphonic orchestra in Catalonia. In 1999, the OBC inaugurated its new venue in the brand-new Auditorium (L'Auditori). It performs around 75 concerts per season and its current director is Eiji Oue.[137] It is home to the Barcelona Guitar Orchestra, directed by Sergi Vicente. The major thoroughfare of La Rambla is home to mime artists and street performers. Yearly, two major pop music festivals take place in the city, the S\u00f3nar Festival and the Primavera Sound Festival. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBuses in Barcelona are a major form of public transport, with extensive local, interurban and night bus networks. Most local services are operated by the TMB, although some other services are operated by a number of private companies, albeit still within the ATM fare structure. A separate private bus line, known as Aerob\u00fas, links the airport with the city centre, with its own fare structure.\n\n\nThe Estaci\u00f3 del Nord (Northern Station), a former railway station which was renovated for the 1992 Olympic Games, now serves as the terminus for long-distance and regional bus services.\n\n\n\n### Taxi[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSome older sources suggest that the city may have been named after the Carthaginian general Hamilcar Barca, who was supposed to have founded the city in the 3rd century BC,[22] but there is no evidence that Barcelona was ever a Carthaginian settlement, or that its name in antiquity, *Barcino*, had any connection with the Barcid family of Hamilcar.[23] During the Middle Ages, the city was variously known as *Barchinona*, *Bar\u00e7alona*, *Barchelonaa*, and *Barchenona*.\n\n\nInternationally,[*citation needed*] Barcelona's name is abbreviated colloquially to 'Bar\u00e7a' as a result of its status as the hometown of the football club FC Barcelona, whose anthem is the *Cant del Bar\u00e7a* (\"Bar\u00e7a chant\").

As one of the two biggest cities in Spain, Barcelona is subject to a special law articulated through the *Carta Municipal* (Municipal Law). A first version of this law was passed in 1960 and amended later, but the current version was approved in March 2006.[125] According to this law, Barcelona's city council is organised in two levels: a political one, with elected city councillors, and one executive, which administers the programs and executes the decisions taken on the political level.[126] This law also gives the local government a special relationship with the central government and it also gives the mayor wider prerogatives by the means of municipal executive commissions.[127] It expands the powers of the city council in areas like telecommunications, city traffic, road safety and public safety. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBarcelona was recognised as the Southern European City of the Future for 2014/15, based on its economic potential,[99] by *FDi Magazine* in their bi-annual rankings.[100]\n\n\n\n### Trade fair and exhibitions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nThe World Trade Center Barcelona\n![](image)\nThe Palau de Congressos de Barcelona\n\nDrawing upon its tradition of creative art and craftsmanship, Barcelona is known for its award-winning industrial design. It also has several congress halls, notably Fira de Barcelona \u2013 the second largest trade fair and exhibition centre in Europe, that host a quickly growing number of national and international events each year (at present above 50). The total exhibition floor space of Fira de Barcelona venues is 405,000\u00a0m2 (41\u00a0ha), not counting Gran Via centre on the Plaza de Europa. However, the Eurozone crisis and deep cuts in business travel affected the council's positioning of the city as a convention centre.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSpanish is the most spoken language in Barcelona (according to the linguistic census held by the Government of Catalonia in 2013) and it is understood almost universally. Catalan is also very commonly spoken in the city: it is understood by 95% of the population, while 72.3% can speak it, 79% can read it, and 53% can write it.[76] Knowledge of Catalan has increased significantly in recent decades thanks to a language immersion educational system.\n\n\nAfter Catalan and Spanish, the most spoken languages in Barcelona are those from North Africa, such as Amazigh and Arabic, followed by Bengali, Urdu, Panjabi, Mandarin Chinese, Romanian, English, Russian and Quechua, according to data collected by the University of Barcelona.[77]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Port Vell in winter\nThe Barcelona harbour is the leading European cruiser port and a very important Mediterranean turnaround base.[148] In 2013, 3.6\u00a0million pleasure cruise passengers used the Port of Barcelona.[146]\n\n\nThe Port Vell area also houses the Maremagnum (a commercial mall), a multiplex cinema, the IMAX Port Vell and one of Europe's largest aquariums \u2013 Aquarium Barcelona, containing 8,000 fish and 11 sharks contained in 22 basins filled with 4 million litres of sea water.

The rainfall pattern is characterised by a short (3 months) dry season in summer, as well as less winter rainfall than in a typical Mediterranean climate. However, both June and August are wetter than February, which is unusual for the Mediterranean climate. This subtype, labelled as \"Portuguese\" by the French geographer George Viers after the climate classification of Emmanuel de Martonne[68] and found in the NW Mediterranean area (e.g. Marseille), can be seen as transitional to the humid subtropical climate (*Cfa*) found in inland areas.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Montju\u00efc Castle\n* Montju\u00efc Communications Tower\n* Old Hospital de la Santa Creu\n* Palau de la Generalitat de Catalunya\n* Palau del Parlament de Catalunya\n* Palau G\u00fcell\n* Palau Nacional\n* Royal Palace of Pedralbes\n* Palau Reial Major\n* Palau Robert\n* Poble Espanyol\n* Port Ol\u00edmpic\n* Port Vell\n* Sagrada Fam\u00edlia\n* Santa Maria del Mar\n* Santa Maria del Pi\n* Temple Expiatori del Sagrat Cor\n* Torre de Collserola\n* Torre Gl\u00f2ries\n* Venetian Towers\n* Virreina Palace\n* World Trade Center Barcelona\n |\n| Museums | * Archaeology Museum of Catalonia\n* Barcelona Museum of Contemporary Art\n* CaixaForum Barcelona\n* Can Framis Museum\n* Centre d'Art Santa M\u00f2nica\n* Centre de Cultura Contempor\u00e0nia de Barcelona\n* CosmoCaixa Barcelona\n* FC Barcelona Museum\n* Fundaci\u00f3 Antoni T\u00e0pies\n* Fundaci\u00f3 Joan Mir\u00f3\n* Gabinet de les Arts Gr\u00e0fiques\n* Gaud\u00ed House Museum\n* Jard\u00ed Bot\u00e0nic de Barcelona\n* Juan Antonio Samaranch Olympic and Sports Museum\n* Maritime Museum\n* Museu Barbier-Mueller d'Art Precolomb\u00ed\n* Museu de la M\u00fasica\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)B-20 motorway in Barcelona\nBarcelona lies on three international routes, including European route E15 that follows the Mediterranean coast, European route E90 to Madrid and Lisbon, and European route E09 to Paris.

Areas outside of the urbanised districts can have as much as 2\u00a0\u00b0C of difference in temperatures throughout the year.[69] Its average annual temperature is 21.2\u00a0\u00b0C (70.2\u00a0\u00b0F) during the day and 15.1\u00a0\u00b0C (59.2\u00a0\u00b0F) at night. The average annual temperature of the sea is about 20\u00a0\u00b0C (68\u00a0\u00b0F). In the coldest month, January, the temperature typically ranges from 12 to 18\u00a0\u00b0C (54 to 64\u00a0\u00b0F) during the day, 6 to 12\u00a0\u00b0C (43 to 54\u00a0\u00b0F) at night and the average sea temperature is 13\u00a0\u00b0C (55\u00a0\u00b0F).[70] In the warmest month, August, the typical temperature ranges from 27 to 31\u00a0\u00b0C (81 to 88\u00a0\u00b0F) during the day, about 23\u00a0\u00b0C (73\u00a0\u00b0F) at night and the average sea temperature is 26\u00a0\u00b0C (79\u00a0\u00b0F).[70] Generally, the summer or \"holiday\" season lasts about six months, from May to October. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Barcelona\u2013El Prat Airport as seen from the air\nBarcelona is served by Barcelona-El Prat Airport, about 17\u00a0km (11\u00a0mi) south-west of the centre of Barcelona. It is the second-largest airport in Spain, and the largest on the Mediterranean coast, which handled more than 50.17\u00a0million passengers in 2018, showing an annual upward trend.[145] It is a main hub for Vueling Airlines and Ryanair, and also a focus for Iberia and Air Europa. The airport mainly serves domestic and European destinations, although some airlines offer destinations in Latin America, Asia and the United States. The airport is connected to the city by highway, metro (Airport T1 and Airport T2 stations), commuter train (Barcelona Airport railway station) and scheduled bus service. A new terminal (T1) has been built, and entered service on 17 June 2009.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* ***Krasnogorsk and Moscow***,\u00a0Moscow Oblast (de facto)\n* ***Kursk***,\u00a0Kursk Oblast\n* ***Lipetsk***,\u00a0Lipetsk Oblast\n* ***Murmansk***,\u00a0Murmansk Oblast\n* ***Nizhny Novgorod***,\u00a0Nizhny Novgorod Oblast\n* ***Orenburg***,\u00a0Orenburg Oblast\n* ***Oryol***,\u00a0Oryol Oblast\n* ***Penza***,\u00a0Penza Oblast\n* ***Pskov***,\u00a0Pskov Oblast\n* ***Rostov-on-Don***,\u00a0Rostov Oblast\n* ***Ryazan***,\u00a0Ryazan Oblast\n* ***Saint Petersburg***,\u00a0Leningrad Oblast (de facto)\n* ***Samara***,\u00a0Samara Oblast\n* ***Saratov***,\u00a0Saratov Oblast\n* ***Smolensk***,\u00a0Smolensk Oblast\n* ***Tambov***,\u00a0Tambov Oblast\n* ***Tula***,\u00a0Tula Oblast\n* ***Tver***,\u00a0Tver Oblast\n* ***Ulyanovsk***,\u00a0Ulyanovsk Oblast\n* ***Veliky Novgorod***,\u00a0Novgorod Oblast\n* ***Vladimir***,\u00a0Vladimir Oblast\n* ***Volgograd***,\u00a0Volgograd Oblast\n* ***Vologda***,\u00a0Vologda Oblast\n* ***Voronezh***,\u00a0Voronezh Oblast\n* ***Yaroslavl***,\u00a0Yaroslavl Oblast\n |\n| Federal cities | * ***Moscow***,\u00a0Moscow\n* ***Saint Petersburg***,\u00a0Saint Petersburg\n* ***Sevastopol***,\u00a0Sevastopol (disputed)\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Sagrada Fam\u00edlia church, designed by Gaud\u00ed\n![](image)Palau de la M\u00fasica Catalana\nThe *Barri G\u00f2tic* (Catalan for \"Gothic Quarter\") is the centre of the old city of Barcelona. Many of the buildings date from medieval times, some from as far back as the Roman settlement of Barcelona. Catalan *modernista* architecture (related to the movement known as Art Nouveau in the rest of Europe) developed between 1885 and 1950 and left an important legacy in Barcelona. Several of these buildings are World Heritage Sites. Especially remarkable is the work of architect Antoni Gaud\u00ed, which can be seen throughout the city. His best-known work is the immense but still unfinished church of the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia, which has been under construction since 1882 and is still financed by private donations.

Eurostat places Paris (6.5 million people) behind London (8 million) and ahead of Berlin (3.5 million), based on the 2012 populations of what Eurostat calls \"urban audit core cities\".[157]\nThe population of Paris today is lower than its historical peak of 2.9 million in 1921.[158] The principal reasons were a significant decline in household size, and a dramatic migration of residents to the suburbs between 1962 and 1975. Factors in the migration included de-industrialisation, high rent, the gentrification of many inner quarters, the transformation of living space into offices, and greater affluence among working families. The city's population loss came to a temporary halt at the beginning of the 21st century; the population increased from 2,125,246 in 1999 to 2,240,621 in 2012, before declining again slightly in 2017, 2018, and again in 2021.[159][160]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"R\u00e9pertoire national des \u00e9lus: les maires\" (in French). data.gouv.fr, Plateforme ouverte des donn\u00e9es publiques fran\u00e7aises. 16 December 2022.

Other difficult areas are located in the Seine valley, in \u00c9vry et Corbeil-Essonnes (Essonne), in Mureaux, Mantes-la-Jolie (Yvelines), and scattered among social housing districts created by Delouvrier's 1961 \"ville nouvelle\" political initiative.[149]\n\n\nThe Paris agglomeration's urban sociology is basically that of 19th-century Paris: the wealthy live in the west and southwest, and the middle-to-working classes are in the north and east.

Of the foreign visitors, the greatest number came from the United States (2.6\u00a0million), United Kingdom (1.2\u00a0million), Germany (981\u00a0thousand) and China (711\u00a0thousand).[204]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe other most-visited Paris museums in 2021 were the Fondation Louis Vuitton (691,000), the Mus\u00e9e du Quai Branly \u2013 Jacques Chirac, featuring the indigenous art and cultures of Africa, Asia, Oceania, and the Americas. (616,000); the Mus\u00e9e Carnavalet (History of Paris) (606,000), and the Petit Palais, the art museum of the City of Paris (518,000).[213]\n\n\n\n![](image)Mus\u00e9e du quai Branly\nThe Mus\u00e9e de l'Orangerie, near both the Louvre and the Orsay, also exhibits Impressionists and Post-Impressionists, including most of Claude Monet's large *Water Lilies* murals. The Mus\u00e9e national du Moyen \u00c2ge, or Cluny Museum, presents Medieval art. The Guimet Museum, or *Mus\u00e9e national des arts asiatiques*, has one of the largest collections of Asian art in Europe. There are also notable museums devoted to individual artists, including the Mus\u00e9e Picasso, the Mus\u00e9e Rodin and the Mus\u00e9e national Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSixty-two percent of its buildings date from 1949 and before, 20 percent were built between 1949 and 1974, and only 18 percent of the buildings remaining were built after that date.[139] Two-thirds of the city's 1.3 million residences are studio and two-room apartments. Paris averages 1.9 people per residence, a number that has remained constant since the 1980s, but it is much less than \u00cele-de-France's 2.33 person-per-residence average. Only 33 percent of principal residence Parisians own their habitation (against 47 percent for the entire \u00cele-de-France): the major part of the city's population is a rent-paying one.[139] Social or public housing represented 19.9 percent of the city's total residences in 2017. Its distribution varies widely throughout the city, from 2.6 percent of the housing in the wealthy 7th arrondissement, to 39.9 percent in the 19th arrondissement.[140]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPrior to the 2020 Paris municipal election, each of Paris's 20 arrondissements had its own town hall and a directly elected council (*conseil d'arrondissement*), which, in turn, elects an arrondissement mayor.[114] The council of each arrondissement is composed of members of the Conseil de Paris and also members who serve only on the council of the arrondissement. The number of deputy mayors in each arrondissement varies depending upon its population. As of 1996, there were a total of 20 arrondissement mayors and 120 deputy mayors.[109] The creation of Paris Centre, a unified administrative division with a single mayor covering the first four arrondissements, took effect with the said 2020 election; the other 16 arrondissements continue to have their own mayors.[115]\n\n\n\n### M\u00e9tropole du Grand Paris[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe most prestigious sculptors who made their reputation in Paris in the modern era are Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Auguste Bartholdi (Statue of Liberty), Auguste Rodin, Camille Claudel, Antoine Bourdelle, Paul Landowski (statue of *Christ the Redeemer* in Rio de Janeiro) and Aristide Maillol. The Golden Age of the School of Paris ended between the two world wars.\n\n\n\n### Museums[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of museums in Paris\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nParis is a major railway, highway, and air-transport hub served by two international airports: Charles de Gaulle Airport (the third-busiest airport in Europe) and Orly Airport.[11][12] Opened in 1900, the city's subway system, the Paris M\u00e9tro, serves 5.23 million passengers daily;[13] it is the second-busiest metro system in Europe after the Moscow Metro. Gare du Nord is the 24th-busiest railway station in the world and the busiest outside Japan, with 262 million passengers in 2015.[14] Paris is especially known for its museums and architectural landmarks: the Louvre received 7.8 million visitors in 2022, keeping its position as the most-visited art museum in the world.[15] The Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, Mus\u00e9e Marmottan Monet and Mus\u00e9e de l'Orangerie are noted for their collections of French Impressionist art. The Pompidou Centre Mus\u00e9e National d'Art Moderne has the largest collection of modern and contemporary art in Europe and Mus\u00e9e Rodin and Mus\u00e9e Picasso. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSince the inauguration of its first line in 1900, Paris's M\u00e9tro network has grown to become the city's most widely used local transport system; today it carries about 5.23 million passengers daily[283] through 16 lines, 308 stations (391 stops) and 226.9\u00a0km (141.0\u00a0mi) of rails. Superimposed on this is a 'regional express network', the RER, whose five lines, 257 stops and 587\u00a0km (365\u00a0mi) of rails connect Paris to more distant parts of the urban area. In addition, the Paris region is served by a light rail network, the tramway. Opened since 1992 for its first line, thirteen lines are currently operational. The network is 164.4 kilometres (102.2\u00a0mi) long with 248 stations.\n\n\n\n#### Air[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBal-musette is a style of French music and dance that first became popular in Paris in the 1870s and 1880s; by 1880 Paris had some 150 dance halls.[231] Patrons danced the bourr\u00e9e to the accompaniment of the cabrette (a bellows-blown bagpipe locally called a \"musette\") and often the vielle \u00e0 roue (hurdy-gurdy) in the caf\u00e9s and bars of the city. Parisian and Italian musicians who played the accordion adopted the style and established themselves in Auvergnat bars,[232] anParis became a major centre for jazz and still attracts jazz musicians from all around the world to its clubs and caf\u00e9s.[233]\n\n\nParis is the spiritual home of gypsy jazz in particular, and many of the Parisian jazzmen who developed in the first half of the 20th century began by playing Bal-musette in the city.[232] Django Reinhardt rose to fame in Paris, having moved to the 18th arrondissement in a caravan as a young boy, and performed with violinist St\u00e9phane Grappelli and their Quintette du Hot Club de France in the 1930s and 1940s.[234]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n173. **^** Burchardt, Marian; Michalowski, Ines (26 November 2014). *After Integration: Islam, Conviviality and Contentious Politics in Europe*.

The *Moulin Rouge* was opened in 1889 and became the birthplace of the dance known as the French Cancan. It helped make famous the singers Mistinguett and \u00c9dith Piaf and the painter Toulouse-Lautrec, who made posters for the venue. In 1911, the dance hall Olympia Paris invented the grand staircase as a settling for its shows, competing with its great rival, the *Folies Berg\u00e8re*. Its stars in the 1920s included the American singer and dancer Josephine Baker. Later, Olympia Paris presented Dalida, Edith Piaf, Marlene Dietrich, Miles Davis, Judy Garland and the Grateful Dead.\n\n\nThe Casino de Paris presented many famous French singers, including Mistinguett, Maurice Chevalier and Tino Rossi. Other famous Paris music halls include *Le Lido*, on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, opened in 1946; and the Crazy Horse Saloon, featuring strip-tease, dance and magic, opened in 1951. A half dozen music halls exist today in Paris, attended mostly by visitors to the city.[219]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe City of Paris is the centre of the \u00cele-de-France region, or Paris Region, with an official estimated population of 12,271,794 inhabitants on January 1, 2023, or about 19% of the population of France,[2] making the region France's primate city. The Paris Region had a GDP of \u20ac765 billion (US$1.064 trillion, PPP)[8] in 2021, the highest in the European Union.[9] According to the Economist Intelligence Unit Worldwide Cost of Living Survey, in 2022, Paris was the city with the ninth-highest cost of living in the world.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring the First World War, Paris sometimes found itself on the front line; 600 to 1,000 Paris taxis played a small but highly important symbolic role in transporting 6,000 soldiers to the front line at the First Battle of the Marne. The city was also bombed by Zeppelins and shelled by German long-range guns.[66] In the years after the war, known as *Les Ann\u00e9es Folles*, Paris continued to be a mecca for writers, musicians and artists from around the world, including Ernest Hemingway, Igor Stravinsky, James Joyce, Josephine Baker, Eva Kotchever, Henry Miller, Ana\u00efs Nin, Sidney Bechet[67] and Salvador Dal\u00ed.[68]\n\n\nIn the years after the peace conference, the city was also home to growing numbers of students and activists from French colonies and other Asian and African countries, who later became leaders of their countries, such as Ho Chi Minh, Zhou Enlai and L\u00e9opold S\u00e9dar Senghor.[69]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Median income in Paris and its nearest departments in 2018 (high income in red, low income in yellow)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Blois (Loir-et-Cher)\n* Saint-\u00c9tienne (Loire)\n* Le Puy-en-Velay (Haute-Loire)\n* Nantes (Loire-Atlantique)\n* Orl\u00e9ans (Loiret)\n* Cahors (Lot)\n* Agen (Lot-et-Garonne)\n* Mende (Loz\u00e8re)\n* Angers (Maine-et-Loire)\n* Saint-L\u00f4 (Manche)\n* Ch\u00e2lons-en-Champagne (Marne)\n* Chaumont (Haute-Marne)\n* Laval (Mayenne)\n* Nancy (Meurthe-et-Moselle)\n* Bar-le-Duc (Meuse)\n* Vannes (Morbihan)\n* Metz (Moselle)\n* Nevers (Ni\u00e8vre)\n* Lille (Nord)\n* Beauvais (Oise)\n* Alen\u00e7on (Orne)\n* Arras (Pas-de-Calais)\n* Clermont-Ferrand (Puy-de-D\u00f4me)\n* Pau (Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques)\n* Tarbes (Hautes-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es)\n* Perpignan (Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales)\n* Strasbourg (Bas-Rhin)\n* Colmar (Haut-Rhin)\n* Lyon (Rh\u00f4ne)\n* Vesoul (Haute-Sa\u00f4ne)\n* M\u00e2con (Sa\u00f4ne-et-Loire)\n* Le Mans (Sarthe)\n* Chamb\u00e9ry (Savoie)\n* Annecy (Haute-Savoie)\n* Paris (Paris)\n* Rouen (Seine-Maritime)\n* Melun (Seine-et-Marne)\n* Versailles (Yvelines)\n* Niort (Deux-S\u00e8vres)\n* Amiens (Somme)\n* Albi (Tarn)\n* Montauban (Tarn-et-Garonne)\n* Toulon (Var)\n* Avignon (Vaucluse)\n* La Roche-sur-Yon (Vend\u00e9e)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Hall, Peter; Pain, Kathy (2012). *The Polycentric Metropolis: Learning from Mega-City Regions in Europe*.

By 2020 its basic competencies will include urban planning, housing and protection of the environment.[116][118] The first president of the metropolitan council, Patrick Ollier, was elected on 22 January 2016. Though the Metropole has a population of nearly seven million people and accounts for 25 percent of the GDP of France, it has a very small budget: just 65 million Euros, compared with eight billion Euros for the City of Paris.[119]\n\n\n\n### Regional government[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Magdalena Frackowiak at Paris Fashion Week (Fall 2011)\nSince the 19th century, Paris has been an international fashion capital, particularly in the domain of haute couture (clothing hand-made to order for private clients).[252] It is home to some of the largest fashion houses in the world, including Dior and Chanel, as well as many other well-known and more contemporary fashion designers, such as Karl Lagerfeld, Jean-Paul Gaultier, Yves Saint Laurent, Givenchy, and Christian Lacroix. Paris Fashion Week, held in January and July in the Carrousel du Louvre among other renowned city locations, is one of the top four events on the international fashion calendar.[253][254] Moreover, Paris is also the home of the world's largest cosmetics company: L'Or\u00e9al as well as three of the top five global makers of luxury fashion accessories: Louis Vuitton, Herm\u00e9s, and Cartier.[255] Most of the major fashion designers have their showrooms along the Avenue Montaigne, between the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es and the Seine.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The Sorbonne University\nParis is the d\u00e9partement with the highest proportion of highly educated people. In 2009, around 40 percent of Parisians held a *licence*-level diploma or higher, the highest proportion in France,[309] while 13 percent have no diploma, the third-lowest percentage in France. Education in Paris and the \u00cele-de-France region employs approximately 330,000 people, 170,000 of whom are teachers and professors teaching approximately 2.9 million students in around 9,000 primary, secondary, and higher education schools and institutions.[310]\n\n\nThe University of Paris, founded in the 12th century, is often called the Sorbonne after one of its original medieval colleges. It was broken up into thirteen autonomous universities in 1970, following the student demonstrations in 1968. Most of the campuses today are in the Latin Quarter where the old university was located, while others are scattered around the city and the suburbs.[311]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)A map of the arrondissements of Paris\nFor almost all of its long history, except for a few brief periods, Paris was governed directly by representatives of the king, emperor, or president of France. The city was not granted municipal autonomy by the National Assembly until 1974.[109] The first modern elected mayor of Paris was Jacques Chirac, elected 20 March 1977, becoming the city's first mayor since 1871 and only the fourth since 1794. The current mayor is Anne Hidalgo, a socialist, first elected 5 April 2014[110] and re-elected 28 June 2020.[111]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Several video games, including *Hotline Miami*, the Gameloft racing game *Asphalt Overdrive*, *Scarface: The World Is Yours*, and the fictional Vice City in several video games across the *Grand Theft Auto* series, most notably *Grand Theft Auto: Vice City*, is based on Miami.[155]\n\n\n\n### Entertainment and performing arts[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Non-Hispanic Black population of the city of Miami peaked in 1990 at almost 90,000 (making up nearly a quarter of the population of the city).

At the time of the most recent census in 2020, it was found to be 52,447, only 11.7% of the population. Reasons for this include high costs in areas such as Liberty City and Little Haiti, compounded with gentrification.[85][86]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n75. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** \"General Population Characteristics FLORIDA 1980 Census of Population\" (PDF). *07553445v1chA-Cpt11sec1ch002.pdf*.

This caused the Non-Hispanic White population to rise from a nadir of 11.8% at the time of the 2000 census to 11.9% at the time of the 2010 census. After this, the Non-Hispanic White population grew significantly faster than the city as a whole did during the 2010s, and by the time of the 2020 census, Non-Hispanic Whites made up 14.0% of the population of the city and numbered 61,829, the highest number since the 1980s.

In 2011, 85% of Telemundo's original programming was filmed in Miami.[137] Miami is also a significant music recording center, with the Sony Music Latin headquarters in the city,[138] along with many other smaller record labels. The city also attracts many artists for music video and film shoots.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Authority control databases ![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\n |\n| --- |\n| International | * FAST\n* VIAF\n\t+ 2\n* WorldCat\n |\n| National | * Spain\n* France\n* BnF data\n* Argentina\n* Catalonia\n* Germany\n* Israel\n* United States\n* Czech Republic\n* Greece\n* Croatia\n |\n| Geographic | * MusicBrainz area\n |\n| Other | * Encyclopedia of Modern Ukraine\n* NARA\n* IdRef\n |\n\nPortals:* ![flag](image) Florida\n* ![icon](image) Geography\n* ![flag](image) United States\n* ![map](image) North America\n* ![](image) Cities\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Barry University, Miami Shores[209]\n* Broward College, Fort Lauderdale[210]\n* Florida Atlantic University, Boca Raton[211]\n* Florida International University, University Park[212]\n* Florida Memorial University, Miami Gardens[213]\n* Keiser University, Fort Lauderdale[214]\n* Miami Dade College, Miami[215]\n* Miami International University of Art & Design\n* Nova Southeastern University, Davie[216]\n* Palm Beach Atlantic University, West Palm Beach[217]\n* Palm Beach State College, Lake Worth Beach[218]\n* St. Thomas University, Miami Gardens[219]\n* Southeastern College, West Palm Beach[220]\n* Talmudic University of Florida, Miami Beach[221]\n* University of Fort Lauderdale, Lauderhill[222]\n* University of Miami, Coral Gables[223]\n\n\n### Primary and secondary schools[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Miami-Dade County Public Schools\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Counties | * Alachua\n* Baker\n* Bay\n* Bradford\n* Brevard\n* Broward\n* Calhoun\n* Charlotte\n* Citrus\n* Clay\n* Collier\n* Columbia\n* DeSoto\n* Dixie\n* Duval\n* Escambia\n* Flagler\n* Franklin\n* Gadsden\n* Gilchrist\n* Glades\n* Gulf\n* Hamilton\n* Hardee\n* Hendry\n* Hernando\n* Highlands\n* Hillsborough\n* Holmes\n* Indian River\n* Jackson\n* Jefferson\n* Lafayette\n* Lake\n* Lee\n* Leon\n* Levy\n* Liberty\n* Madison\n* Manatee\n* Marion\n* Martin\n* Miami\u2011Dade\n* Monroe\n* Mosquito (former county)\n* Nassau\n* Okaloosa\n* Okeechobee\n* Orange\n* Osceola\n* Palm Beach\n* Pasco\n* Pinellas\n* Polk\n* Putnam\n* Santa Rosa\n* Sarasota\n* Seminole\n* St. Johns\n* St. Lucie\n* Sumter\n* Suwannee\n* Taylor\n* Union\n* Volusia\n* Wakulla\n* Walton\n* Washington\n |\n| **![flag](image) Florida portal**\n |\n\nTemplate:USLargestMetros\n\nTemplate:Florida cities and mayors of 100,000 population\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n128. **^** \"Arquitectonica Studios \u2013 Miami Headquarters\". *Arquitectonica*.

However, only 50 were actually built.[139] Rapid high-rise construction led to fast population growth in the Miami's inner neighborhoods, with Downtown, Brickell and Edgewater becoming the fastest-growing areas of the city. The city currently has the seven tallest (as well as fifteen of top twenty) skyscrapers in the state of Florida, with the tallest being the 868-foot (265\u00a0m) Panorama Tower.[140]\n\n\nThe housing market crash of 2007 caused a foreclosure crisis in the area.[141] Like other metro areas in the United States, crime in Miami is localized to specific neighborhoods.[142] In a 2016 study by the website *24/7 Wall Street*, Miami was rated as the worst U.S. city in which to live, based on crime, poverty, income inequality, education, and housing costs that far exceed the national median.[143]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Bayfront Park on Biscayne Bay in February 2017\nThe City of Miami has various lands operated by the National Park Service, the Florida Division of Recreation and Parks, and the City of Miami Department of Parks and Recreation.\n\n\nMiami's tropical weather allows for year-round outdoor activities.[193] The city has numerous marinas, rivers, bays, canals, and the Atlantic Ocean, which make boating, canoeing, sailing, and fishing popular outdoor activities. Biscayne Bay has numerous coral reefs that make snorkeling and scuba diving popular. There are over 80 parks and gardens in the city.[194] The largest and most popular parks are Bayfront Park and Museum Park (located in the heart of Downtown and the location of the Miami-Dade Arena and Bayside Marketplace), Tropical Park, Peacock Park, Virginia Key, and Watson Island.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCuban immigrants in the 1960s originated the Cuban sandwich and brought medianoche, Cuban espresso, Bistec de palomilla, and croquetas, all of which have grown in popularity among all Miamians and have become symbols of the city's varied cuisine. Today, these are part of the local culture and can be found throughout the city at window caf\u00e9s, particularly outside of supermarkets and restaurants.[161][162] Some of these locations, such as the Versailles restaurant in Little Havana, are landmark eateries of Miami. Located on the Atlantic Ocean, and with a long history as a seaport, Miami is also known for its seafood, with many seafood restaurants located along the Miami River and in and around Biscayne Bay.[163] The city is also the headquarters of restaurant chains such as Burger King and Benihana.\n\n\n\n### Dialect[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Miami accent\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| ZIP Codes | 33101-33102, 33106, 33109, 33111-33112, 33114, 33116, 33119, 33122, 33124-33138, 33140-33147, 33149-33158, 33160-33170, 33172-33199, 33206, 33222, 33231, 33233-33234, 33238-33239, 33242-33243, 33245, 33247, 33255-33257, 33261, 33265-33266, 33269, 33280, 33283, 33296, 33299\n |\n| Area code(s) | 305, 786, 645 |\n| FIPS code | 12-45000 |\n| GNIS feature ID | 277593, 2411786 |\n| GDP (Miami-Dade County, 2021) | $155\u00a0billion[10] (14th) |\n| GMP (Metro, 2021) | $403\u00a0billion[11][12] (12th) |\n| Website | miamigov.com |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThere has been a Norwegian Seamen's church in Miami since the early 1980s.

Around 4,000 of them are Norwegian. The church is also an important place for the 150 Norwegians that work at Walt Disney World in Central Florida.[119]\n\n\nAccording to the 2022 Point-In-Time Homeless Count, there were 3,440 homeless people in Miami-Dade County,[120] 970 of which were on the streets.

The city is located 300\u00a0km (186\u00a0mi) northwest of Buenos Aires, on the west bank of the Paran\u00e1 River. Rosario is the third-most populous city in the country, and is also the most populous city in Argentina that is not a capital (provincial or national). With a growing and important metropolitan area, Greater Rosario has an estimated population of 1,750,000 as of 2020[update].[4][5] One of its main attractions includes the neoclassical, Art Nouveau,[6] and Art Deco architecture that has been retained over the centuries in hundreds of residences, houses and public buildings.\n\n\nRosario is the head city of the Rosario Department and is located at the heart of the major industrial corridor in Argentina. The city is a major railroad terminal and the shipping center for north-eastern Argentina. Ships reach the city via the Paran\u00e1 River, which allows the existence of a 10-metre-deep (34\u00a0ft) port. The Port of Rosario is subject to silting and must be dredged periodically.[7] Exports include wheat, flour, hay, linseed and other vegetable oils, corn, sugar, lumber, meat, hides, and wool. Manufactured goods include flour, sugar, meat products, and other foodstuffs. The Rosario-Victoria Bridge, opened in 2004, spans the Paran\u00e1 River, connecting Rosario with the city of Victoria, across the Paran\u00e1 Delta. The city plays a critical role in agricultural commerce, and thus finds itself at the center of a continuing debate over taxes levied on big-ticket agricultural goods such as soy.\n\n\nAlong with Paran\u00e1, Rosario is one of the few Argentine cities that cannot point to a particular individual as its founder. The city's patron is the \"Virgin of the Rosary\", whose feast day is October 7.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Rosario\n\n### Early settlement[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Map of the city of Rosario c. 1877\n![](image)Rosario port area in 1888\nEven though the city did not have a clear foundation date or any official acknowledgement thereof, most commentators state that Rosario was founded on 7 October 1793 with a local population of 457 inhabitants.[8] Nonetheless, the town was officially declared a *city* on 3 August 1852, at the time it was known as ***Pago de los Arroyos***, that is, \"land of the streams\", a reference to the several small rivers that traverse the southern region of Santa Fe, like the Ludue\u00f1a Stream, the Saladillo Stream and others, emptying into the Paran\u00e1 River. In 1689, captain Lu\u00eds Romero de Pi\u00f1eda received part of the lands of the Pago de los Arroyos by royal decree, as payment for services to the Spanish Crown. Before that, the area was originally inhabited by various indigenous tribes, some of which lived in *reducciones*, a type of mission founded by Franciscans. These missions were ultimately attacked and destroyed by hostile tribes of the Chaco region.\n\n\nRomero de Pi\u00f1eda established the first permanent settlement, an *estancia* \u2014 intended as farmland, not as a town. In 1719, the Jesuits bought another part and established *Estancia San Miguel*. The area was still so scarcely populated that it had no central authority; it was ruled from the provincial capital (Santa Fe), and in turn from Buenos Aires.\n\n\nIn 1724, another colonial settlement was initiated by Santiago de Montenegro, who set up a mill, drew plans for the future town, built a chapel, and was appointed mayor in 1751. The area of control of this local government extended northward from today's Rosario; only in 1784 was it divided into two smaller jurisdictions.\n\n\nOn February 27, 1812, General Manuel Belgrano raised the newly created Argentine flag on the shores of the Paran\u00e1, for the first time. Because of this, Rosario is known as the \"Cradle of the Argentine Flag\". The National Flag Memorial marks the occasion.\n\n\n\n### 19th century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rosario's old Customs Office, on Belgrano Avenue\nThe province of Santa Fe suffered greatly from the civil war that afflicted Argentina after 1820. Demographic growth was relatively slow. During this period, Rosario was a small settlement and a stop on the way from the city of Santa Fe to Buenos Aires. In 1823, it was elevated to the category of \"village\" (*Ilustre y Fiel Villa del Rosario*). Charles Darwin travelled through the area in 1832 and described Rosario as \"a large town\" with about 2,000 residents. In 1841, a decree of the *caudillo* and Governor of Buenos Aires, Juan Manuel de Rosas, banned navigation of the Paran\u00e1 and Paraguay rivers to non-Argentine vessels, and thus shut off the Port of Rosario to foreign trade.\n\n\nOn 25 December 1851, a small group of locals and the military guard of the city declared their support for the rival *caudillo* Justo Jos\u00e9 de Urquiza. As a reward for their participation in the Battle of Caseros, triumphant Urquiza wrote to the governor of Santa Fe on 9 June 1852 asking for Rosario to be granted city status. Governor Domingo Crespo justified the request at the provincial legislative body, marking the geographically strategic position of the town for national and international trade, and on 5 August, Rosario was formally declared a city.\n\n\nUrquiza opened up the river for free international trade. The city's economy and population expanded at an accelerated rate. By 1880, Rosario had become the first export outlet of Argentina. During the last 15 years of the 19th century, the city more than doubled its population, in part due to immigration. By 1887 it had about 50,000 inhabitants, of whom 40% were European immigrants, who brought new ideas from Europe and began to turn Rosario into a politically progressive city (contrasting with the more conservative, aristocratic Santa Fe).\n\n\nDuring the second half of the 19th century, there was a movement promoting that the city of Rosario become the capital of the republic. Ovidio Lagos, founder of the oldest Argentine newspaper, *La Capital*, was one of the strongest proponents of this idea (one of the main avenues in Rosario now carries his name). Rosario was indeed declared the federal capital on three occasions, but each time the law was vetoed by the Executive Branch (once by Bartolom\u00e9 Mitre and twice by Domingo Faustino Sarmiento). In 1911, the French-owned railway company Ferrocarril Rosario y Puerto Belgrano opened a line between Rosario and Puerto Belgrano, Argentina's main naval base. By 1926, Rosario had 407,000 inhabitants, 47% of them foreign, many coming from Europe in the wake of World War I.\n\n\n\n### Contemporary history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)National Flag Memorial, downtown Rosario\nIn 1969, workers and students took to the streets and organized strikes in what has been dubbed the \"Rosariazo\" against the dictatorship. A few years later, in 1976, the military dictatorship made hundreds of dissident citizens \"disappear\" in what is known as the Dirty War.\n\n\nIn 1983, Argentina returned to democratic rule, but in 1989, hyperinflation caused the economic collapse of the country. In Rosario there were riots and looting episodes. Under the Menem administration, the situation worsened as the industrial sector of the city was dismantled by foreign competition, and agricultural exports stagnated. In 1995, unemployment in the area reached 21.1% and a large part of Rosario's population fell below the poverty line.\n\n\nSince the recovery of the national economy that followed the 2001 collapse, Rosario's economic situation has improved. The boom in agricultural exports has caused a large increase in consumer spending and investment. The Socialist Party has won mayoral races in the city in every election since Councilman H\u00e9ctor Cavallero's 1989 election. Cavallero's successor, Hermes Binner (elected in 1995), was elected Governor of Santa Fe in 2007 and became the runner-up in the 2011 presidential election on the FAP ticket. Mayor Miguel Lifschitz's administration, elected in 2007, took advantage of the economic boom to invest heavily in public works as well as in public health (which takes up about a quarter of the whole budget). Mayor M\u00f3nica Fein became, in 2011, the first Socialist woman elected mayor in Argentine history.[9]\n\n\nAfter the 1990s, Rosario became a major city of the illegal drug trade in Argentina, headed by a drug dealing family called \"Los Monos\" (\"The Monkeys\").[10] Early during 2018, it was estimated by national news sources that a turf war between local drug gangs (\"Los Funes\" and \"Los Camino\") was costing an average of one life every twenty five hours.[11][12]\n\n\n\n### Historical images\n[edit]\n\n\n* ![Mercado Sud (c.1903)](image)\n\nMercado Sud (c.1903)\n* ![Palace of Justice (c.1905)](image)\n\nPalace of Justice (c.1905)\n* ![Hotel Savoy (c.1910)](image)\n\nHotel Savoy (c.1910)\n* ![San Mart\u00edn Square (c.1920s)](image)\n\nSan Mart\u00edn Square (c.1920s)\n* ![Hip\u00f3lito Yrigoyen on a train during an electoral campaign (1926)](image)\n\nHip\u00f3lito Yrigoyen on a train during an electoral campaign (1926)\n* ![Inauguration of the National Flag Memorial (1957)](image)\n\nInauguration of the National Flag Memorial (1957)\n\n\n## Government[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Government of Rosario\n\n![](image)*Palacio de los Leones* (City Hall)\nRosario is ruled by an executive branch represented by a mayor (seat: Palacio de los Leones), and a legislative branch, consisting of a Deliberative Council (seat: Palacio Vassallo). The mayor is elected for a four-year term, and the Council renews half of its 21 members every two years.\n\n\n\n### Municipal Centre District (CMD)[edit]\n\n\nSince 1997, a municipal program of decentralization of legislative activities was carried out, materialized in 6 Municipal Centres of District (Centre, North, South, West, Northwest and Southwest).\n\n\nThe city is divided into six large administrative districts (Center, North, Northwest, West, Southwest, and South), with Municipal District Centers that provide services to the population.\n\n\nFor years, local people and institutions have been pushing the provincial government to grant Rosario the status of Autonomous City. Some, with the sponsorship of the governors of Santa Fe, Entre R\u00edos and C\u00f3rdoba as well as other important politicians, have put forward a legislative project to move the National Congress to Rosario, to decentralize the national government.[13]\n\n\nSince the return to democracy in 1983, the mayors of Rosario were Horacio Usandizaga, H\u00e9ctor Cavallero (standing in for Usandizaga, then re-elected), Hermes Binner (re-elected once), Miguel Lifschitz (re-elected once), and, since December 2011 to December 2019, M\u00f3nica Fein. Currently, the mayor is Pablo Javkin, whose term lasts from December 2019 to 2023. From Cavallero on (1989), the mayor has been a member of the Socialist Party, since December 2019, Rosario's mayor is from a different political party, ending more than 30 years of socialism.\n\n\nThe city does not have a police force of its own (it is served by the provincial police), but in 2004 it pioneered the creation of a special patrol force of unarmed officers called *Guardia Urbana Municipal* (\"Municipal Urban Guard\"), which was later used as a model for Buenos Aires and other cities.\n\n\n\n![](image)*Parroquia del Perpetuo Socorro*, a church at Lisandro de la Torre district\n### Municipal statistics[edit]\n\n\nThe municipality of Rosario comprises 178.69 square kilometres (69.0\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), of which 117.2\u00a0km2 (45\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) are urbanized, in 6,306 housing blocks. Of this area, 9.3\u00a0km2 (3.6\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), 5.3% is devoted to green spaces (parks, boulevards, plazas), which gives over 10 m2 of green space per inhabitant.\n\n\nElectric power is supplied to the whole urban area and running water reaches 97% of the population (about 350,000 homes). Natural gas is provided to 227,152 homes.[14]\n\n\nWith the recovery of the national economy since 2002, the city experienced a real-estate boom. In the period 2003\u20132006, the construction sector added 2\u00a0million m2, investing about $900 million. Despite this increased supply, both price and rent have increased sharply compared to the values during the 1990s.\n\n\nAccording to experts, this growth was propelled by the increased purchasing power of farmers around Rosario, helped by competitive exports, and the overall preference for safer investment options.[15]\n\n\n\n### Health[edit]\n\n\nRosario has several public health centers: five municipal hospitals (including a children's hospital and an emergency hospital/trauma center) and a municipal outpatient-only center, plus two large provincial hospitals (Hospital Provincial and Hospital Centenario), and their associated primary care centers in the city proper and its metropolitan area.\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Economy of Argentina\n\n![](image)Bolsa de Comercio Rosario: The Rosario Stock Exchange\nRosario is the centre of a metropolitan region whose economy is based on services and industry, generating the second-largest urban gross regional product of Argentina, after Greater Buenos Aires.[*citation needed*][16] The principal manufacturing sector is the agro industry, whose industries are placed in the northern and southern areas of Greater Rosario; the investments over the last decade have transformed Rosario into a major role of processing oil of the world[17] Many other sectors contribute to the diversified industrial offerings of the city. Rosario and its metropolitan area produce 20% of the cars, 4% of the domestic refrigerators, 80% of the machinery for the food industry and 100% of the auto bodies for long-distance buses made in Argentina.\n\n\nOther important sectors include the petrochemical sector, with three plants located in the suburbs of San Lorenzo and Port San Martin; the chemistry sector, with plants for sulphuric acid, fertilizers, resins and other products; the cellulose industry; the meat industry; ironworks; auto parts; the plants and equipment for bottled oil; agricultural machinery; and the materials and equipment for the construction industry.\nWorldwide international companies settled in Rosario include, among others, General Motors, Cargill, Unilever, John Deere, Petrobr\u00e1s, ICI, Dow, Tenneco and Mahle.\n\n\nThe main financial bank at the city of Rosario is the Municipal Bank of Rosario. Its central offices are located in the financial district, on San Mart\u00edn St., and there are several additional offices throughout the city. It is focused on small and medium enterprises and other organizations, especially through micro credits, and may be considered an \"ethical bank.\"[18]\n\n\n\n![](image)Wood chips carrier Racer on the Paran\u00e1 River, just coming under the Rosario-Victoria Bridge\nThe Municipal Bank was founded in 1896 to support the financial needs of the citizens and small businesses in the highly productive region of southern Santa Fe Province, centered in Rosario. At the time, the city had around 92,000 inhabitants and was already the most important port on the Paran\u00e1 River. The idea of creating a municipal financial institution was expressed in 1893 by Mayor Floduardo Grandoli, citing the proliferation of \"centers of usury\" that exploited those in need of credit, especially the poor (something not addressed by the profile of the Provincial Bank of Santa Fe, which granted loans only to demonstrably solvent persons). Acting on this, the municipal Counseling Commission passed a bill (on 1 February 1895) dictating an \"Organic Charter of the Municipal Bank of Loans and Savings Accounts;\" the bank opened exactly one year later.\n\n\nThe seat of the bank was moved in 1905. Its name was changed to its present form on 14 May 1940 by a municipal bill. Its location was moved again, for the last time so far, in 1986. Following some political controversy, the bank in 2006 was capitalized by the municipality to comply with new regulations dictated by the Central Bank, and transformed into a joint stock company, with only 1% of the stock belonging to the municipal state. A special clause was added, dictating that this minimum share is unchangeable, to prevent hypothetical attempts at privatization.[19]\n\n\nThe Rosario Board of Trade hosts the country's largest commodity market, dealing in cereals and oilseeds, and also the largest futures exchange (ROFEX). The banking sector includes the state-owned Municipal Bank of Rosario, with branches and offices throughout the city, and the central branch of the New Bank of Santa Fe.\n\n\nThe largest technological center in Argentina \u2013 Polo Tecnol\u00f3gico Rosario (PTR) \u2013 is located in Rosario within La Siberia site. The center focuses mainly on research and development of the three following areas: biotechnology, software development, and telecommunications. It currently employs 3,500 people, and it is expected to grow 100% by 2015 to become one of the largest in Latin America.\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nRosario has many cultural activities in many artistic disciplines with national and international reach. The city has produced important personalities in the fields of music, painting, philosophy, politics, poetry, literature, medicine, and law. Among the city's important theaters are El C\u00edrculo, Sala Lavard\u00e9n, Broadway, Astengo Auditorium, and La Comedia. A cultural complex known as Puerto de la M\u00fasica,[20] designed by the modernist architect Oscar Niemeyer (of Brasilia fame), is to be built along the banks of the Paran\u00e1 River. If completed, it will be one of the largest centers for musical performance in Latin America. In 2012, after years without progress, it was put on indefinite hold due to financial constraints. January 1995 saw the launch of the Rosario District Fishing Championship, held in the Parana River. Three years later, in 1998, a 10-year-old Lionel Messi was crowned Junior Champion.\n\n\nThe city has several museums, including Juan B. Castagnino Fine Arts Museum, Firma y Odilo Est\u00e9vez Municipal Decorative Art Museum, Dr. Julio Marc Provincial Historical Museum, City Museum, and Museum of Contemporary Art of Rosario (MACRo). The Dr. \u00c1ngel Gallardo Provincial Natural Sciences Museum was rebuilt after a fire in 2003 and re-opened at a new location in 2006. Rosario also has a public astronomy complex, located in Urquiza Park, which consists of an observatory (inaugurated in 1970) and a planetarium (1984).\n\n\nThe Fundaci\u00f3n Italia is a cultural institution created in 1985 as a \"cultural bond with Italy\". It has organized a Neapolitan music concert, performances of *Madame Butterfly* and numerous talks about the present and future of Argentina. Among the people invited to give these talks were economists Domingo Cavallo and Alfonso Prat Gay, renowned scholars Beatriz Sarlo and Silvia Bleichmar, journalists Alejandro Rozitchner and Jorge As\u00eds, filmmaker Fernando Solanas and former presidents of Chile (Ricardo Lagos), Argentina (Eduardo Duhalde), and Uruguay (Luis Alberto Lacalle Herrera).\n\n\n\n![](image)*El C\u00edrculo* Theatre\n![](image)Planetarium of Rosario\n![](image)Museum of Contemporary Art of Rosario\n![](image)Municipal Museum of Rosario\n### Cultural centers[edit]\n\n\n* Centro Cultural Roberto Fontanarrosa\n* Centro Popular de la Memoria\n* Centro Cultural Islas Malvinas\n* Centro Cultural Estaci\u00f3n Provincial\n* Grupo Pasajes\n* Centro de Cultura & Comunicaci\u00f3n\n* Centro Cultural El N\u00facleo\n* Centro Cultural Los Hornos\n\n\n### Theaters[edit]\n\n\n* Teatro El C\u00edrculo\n* Teatro La Comedia\n* Teatro Auditorio Fundaci\u00f3n\n* Teatro Sala Lavard\u00e9n\n* Teatro Puerto de la M\u00fasica\n* Teatro Municipal Coliseo Podest\u00e1\n* Anfiteatro Mart\u00edn Fierro\n* Teatro La Nonna\n* Teatro La Hermandad del Princesa\n* Sala 420\n* Taller de Teatro de la UNLP\n* Complejo \"El Teatro\"\n* Teatro \"La Lechuza\"\n* Teatro vorterix\n\n\n### Museums[edit]\n\n\n* Dr. Julio Marc Provincial Historical Museum\n* Dr. \u00c1ngel Gallardo Provincial Natural Sciences Museum\n* Firma y Odilo Est\u00e9vez Municipal Decorative Art Museum\n* Juan B.

In 1919, construction began of the Popular Opinion. La Tribuna rose Partners in 1928. Moreover, it had started the construction of a new box office. In 1941, the Tribune Paddock (formerly Partners Tribune) was demolished. The final podium of professional construidaes, begun in 1972. Independence Hippodrome was the initiator in Argentina night time racing, with lighting facilities for this purpose. There's also the Jockey Club de Rosario.\n\n\n\nTracks\nThe racecourse features three tracks that are used for entertainment, vacation, and skills.\nThe Main Track has 1,794 metres (5,886\u00a0ft) of sand. This track is open on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday for tests, with Sunday competitions.\n\n\nThe Assistant Track 1 has 1,650\u00a0m (5,413\u00a0ft) with sand, used on Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays, and Sundays inclusive for the tournaments and some special courses such as race trot.\n\n\nThe Assistant Track 2 has 1,450\u00a0m (4,757\u00a0ft) of land used to jog and tame.\n\n\n\nTribunes\n* Ex-Tribune Partners: with a privileged view of the oval track and focused, this building covers 1,300\u00a0m2 (13,990\u00a0sq\u00a0ft) and three levels, the second is a restaurant seating 150 people.\n* Professional-Tribune, has a covered area of 300\u00a0m2 (3,229\u00a0sq\u00a0ft).

It was commissioned in 1944 and inaugurated on June 20, 1957 \u2013 the anniversary of the death of Manuel Belgrano, creator of the Argentine flag, who raised it for the first time on an island in the river on February 27, 1812.\n\n\nThe complex has a total area of about 10,000\u00a0m2 (107,600\u00a0sq\u00a0ft) and was constructed using stone primarily sourced in the Andes. The structure was designed by the architects \u00c1ngel Guido and Alejandro Bustillo, and the monument was adorned with works by sculptors Lola Mora, Eduardo Barnes, Alfredo Bigatti, and Jos\u00e9 Fioravanti.[23][24]\n\n\nThe Memorial (Monumento) has three parts: the Tower (Torre) or mast, 70 metres (230\u00a0ft) high, which commemorates the Revolution of May 1810 and houses Manuel Belgrano's crypt in its base; the Civic Courtyard (Patio C\u00edvico), which symbolizes the effort of the organization of the state (the Courtyard is used for massive open-air shows), and the Triumphal Propylaeum (Propileo Triunfal), representing the nation as organized after the 1853 Constitution. Under the Propylaeum there is the Honor Room for the Flags of America (where the flags of all American nations are displayed).\n\n\nThe complex faces Belgrano Avenue, and is delimited by C\u00f3rdoba and Santa Fe Streets, the latter of which slopes down towards the river at this point. The Propylaeum can be accessed from the pedestrian passage called Pasaje Juramento (\"Oath Passage\"), which starts at Buenos Aires St. between the municipal building (Palacio de los Leones) and the Cathedral, in front of Plaza 25 de Mayo (May 25 Square). Statues flank the passage by famous sculptor Lola Mora.\n\n\nThe Memorial and the National Flag Park located in front of it are the seat of the main celebrations of Flag Day on June 20. The 50th anniversary of the inauguration of the complex, in 2007, was marked by a special celebration and by the unveiling of a new lighting system.\n[25] El Puerto de la M\u00fasica will be a theater with a total capacity of 30,000 people located by the Paran\u00e1 River.\n\n\nArchitect Oscar Niemeyer came up with the concept by expanding the show from inside the theater to a much larger outside audience. The concrete curvilinear shape building with an area of 215,278\u00a0sq\u00a0ft (20,000.0\u00a0m2) is the first design of Oscar Niemeyer in Argentina.[26] The project will be a distinctive part of Rosario's skyline. Construction will begin at the end of 2010 and is expected to be completed by 2014.\n\n\n\n#### Planetarium[edit]\n\n\nLocated in Urquiza Park, Rosario's Municipal Astronomical Complex is one of the principal astronomical centers of the region.\n\n\nThe planetarium has a core team, together with its secondary elements, providing an artificial image of the sky through projections made on a fixed hemispherical dome that functions as a display.\n\n\nThe assembly is installed in the Room \"Oscar Claudio Caprile\", located in the heart of the magnificent building that is shaped like a comet.\n\n\nFor its technical characteristics in terms of size, quality of sound and image, and interior comfort, this room is considered among the best in the world.\n\n\nThe building in the shape of a comet forms a part of the complex that includes the \"Prof. Victor Capolongo\" observatory and the experimental science museum.\n\n\n\n##### The observatory[edit]\n\n\nMunicipal Astronomical Observatory \"Prof. Victor Capolongo\" was inaugurated on June 18, 1970, and named its first director.\n\n\nThe Observatory facilitates outreach, teaching, and research in the field of astronomy and related sciences and informs the public of phenomena that occur in the sky, such as eclipses, planetary configurations, passages of comets, etc.\n\n\nTo that end, the Observatory has installed two telescopes. One Coud\u00e9 refractor has a 150\u00a0mm (5.9\u00a0in) aperture and 2,250\u00a0mm (88.6\u00a0in) focal distance provided with Lyot's monochromatic filter for solar observation. Another Cassegrain reflector has 300\u00a0mm (11.8\u00a0in) aperture, constructed by the Carl Zeiss company.\n\n\nThere are realized observations and astronomical photography of all the visible celestial objects in Rosario's sky, according to time of year and especially the Sun, the Moon, and the planets Jupiter, Saturn, Mars, and Venus.\n\n\nThe asteroid 14812 Rosario was named in the city's honor as a result.[27]\n\n\n\n##### Experimental Science Museum[edit]\n\n\nThis museum was inaugurated on September 24, 1987. It is the first in Argentina and differs from traditional museums, in that it has equipment and instruments to demonstrate the laws of nature, which can be interactively used by the general public.\n\n\nThus, visitors of all ages can use telescopes and microscopes or experiment with lasers, sound mixers, radios of various types, computers, solar cells, etc.\n\n\nTo complement this, exhibit panels have photographs and explanatory texts of science and technology: mathematics and computer science, engineering, physics, astronomy, astronautics, geology, chemistry, and biology. In addition, an important area is intended for periodic samples, such as the Space Age, energy: renewable and rational use, from sand to glass, among others. The museum staff is supported by contributions from the Ministry of Science and Technology Office, the Municipality of Rosario, and the contributions made by institutions and individuals.\n\n\nThe museum audiovisual projections are made in the Video Sector Science, which has an area called \"CIENCIANI\u00d1O\" (ChildScience) for children aged 4 to 10. The museum works in the evening, similar to the Planetarium. Educational institutions at all levels are treated in shift assignments.\n\n\n\n#### Statue of Che Guevara[edit]\n\n\nThe 4-metre-tall bronze statue of Che Guevara was unveiled on 14 June 2008[28] to commemorate the 80th anniversary of his birth. It is made from 75,000 bronze keys donated by Argentines nationwide[28] and weighs 2.7 tons. The statue was made by artist Andr\u00e9s Zerneri and is the first such monument to Guevara in his native Argentina.[29]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of Argentina\n\n### Demographic distribution[edit]\n\n\n\n\nHistorical population| Year | Pop. | \u00b1% |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1858 | 9,785 | \u2014\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 |\n| 1869 | 23,169 | +136.8% |\n| 1887 | 50,914 | +119.8% |\n| 1900 | 112,462 | +120.9% |\n| 1910 | 192,278 | +71.0% |\n| 1926 | 407,354 | +111.9% |\n| 1947 | 584,587 | +43.5% |\n| 1960 | 669,173 | +14.5% |\n| 1970 | 806,942 | +20.6% |\n| 1980 | 956,761 | +18.6% |\n| 1991 | 1,118,905 | +16.9% |\n| 2001 | 1,161,188 | +3.8% |\n| 2010 | 1,193,605 | +2.8% |\n\n\n![](image)Diagram of the Municipal Districts of Rosario, Centre District, North District, Northwest District, West District, Southwest District and South District\nRosario is located in the Province of Santa Fe, Argentina. This metropolis has a population of about 1.2 million (1,159,004 est.), thus being Argentina's third most populated urban settlement, after C\u00f3rdoba.[30] Greater Rosario comprises Rosario itself (population about 910,000) and a large area around it, spreading in all directions except eastward (because of the Paran\u00e1 River). Directly to the south, it includes the city of Villa Gobernador G\u00e1lvez, with a population of about 75,000, about 10\u00a0km (6.2\u00a0mi) from Rosario city center.\n\n\nTo the west and south-west there are several smaller towns and cities (Funes, Rold\u00e1n, P\u00e9rez, Soldini); Rold\u00e1n is 23\u00a0km (14\u00a0mi) from the Rosario city centre. These settlements were incorporated into the metropolis due to their vicinity to major roads leading into Rosario, and many people living there habitually commute to Rosario.\n\n\nThe farthest end is to the north, following the coast of the river; from Rosario, one finds, in succession and usually merging into each other, the towns of Granadero Baigorria, Capit\u00e1n Berm\u00fadez, Fray Luis Beltr\u00e1n, San Lorenzo (already in a different *departamento*, with a population of over 40,000), and Puerto General San Mart\u00edn, the last being at a distance of 35\u00a0km (22\u00a0mi) from Rosario.\n\n\nThe north of the Greater Rosario is one end of an area traditionally called *Cord\u00f3n Industrial* (\"Industrial Corridor\"), since it was traditionally a heavily industrialized productive region. The prelude to the economic crisis in the 1990s largely dismantled the industrial infrastructure and damaged agricultural exports. These sectors were largely revitalized by 2006 as the national economy continued to recover, but high levels of poverty and unemployment persist in the city's western neighborhoods (official surveys indicated that in 2011, 6.5% of the metro area population was under the poverty line; and that in 2012, 8.3% of the labor force was unemployed).[5][31]\n\n\nIn 1876 the total population was 203,509; by 1926, Rosario had 407,000 inhabitants, 47% of them foreign, many having arrived from Europe in the wake of World War I. Most of these were Italian, and among them, a majority from the north-western region of Liguria.\n\n\nAs of the 2010 Census, there were 1,193,605 people residing in the city and 31 surrounding districts, making Greater Rosario the third-largest metro area in Argentina even as its population growth has leveled off.[3] The population density in Rosario proper was 6,680 inhabitants\u00a0per square kilometer (17,300 inhabitants/sq\u00a0mi); but, only about 2,400/km2 (6,200/sq\u00a0mi) in the suburbs.[32]\n\n\n\n![](image)*Club Espa\u00f1ol de Rosario*, club of the Spanish community in Rosario\nThe 2010 Census also showed a relatively aged population. With 21% under the age of fifteen and 17% over sixty, the people have an age structure similar to those in many North American cities. They are, likewise, more elderly on average than Argentines as a whole (of whom 25% were under 15 and 14%, over 60).[3]\n\n\nThe ethnic make-up of Rosario changed in the late 19th century, when significant numbers of European immigrants arrived in the city. Prior to this the city's population had been almost completely European-descent in ethnic origin. As Buenos Aires was the first landfall in Argentina for many migrant ships coming from Europe in the 1850s and 1890s, Rosario started to experience a diverse influx of people.[*citation needed*] The main contributors were Spain, Italy, France, Croatia, Poland, Russia, Romania, Ukraine, the Balkans (especially Greece, Serbia and Montenegro), Switzerland, Germany, United Kingdom, Ireland, and Scandinavia (especially Sweden). By the 1910s, 43 percent of the city population was non-native Argentine after immigration rates peaked.[33][34]\n\n\nMost immigrants, regardless of origin, settled in the city or around Greater Rosario. However, in the first stages of immigration, some formed colonies (especially agricultural colonies) in different parts of the city, often encouraged by the Argentine government and/or sponsored by private individuals and organizations.\n\n\nChristianity is the dominant faith with Roman Catholicism as the most practiced, followed by Protestantism. Judaism is the second-most professed religion in the city as Rosario has one of the largest Jewish communities in Argentina. There is also a local Islamic society.[35]\n\n\n\n### Districts[edit]\n\n\nRosario is divided into six districts, most named by location, although the easternmost is called *Centre District* for it includes the oldest part of the city, historically called *Centro* (City Centre). The data given below are from the 2001 census [INDEC].\n\n\n\n![](image)Villa Hortensia, the seat of the North District\n![](image)Seat of the Center District, at the former Rosario Central railway station\nCentre District\nPopulation: 261,047 \u00a0 Area: 20.37\u00a0km2 (11.45% of the city)  \n\nPopulation density: 12,815 inhab/km2 \u00a0 Housing: 110,152 units\n\n\n\nNorth District\nPopulation: 131,495 \u00a0 Area: 35.02\u00a0km2 (19.6% of the city)  \n\nPopulation density: 3,744 inhab/km2 \u00a0 Housing: 40,492 units\n\n\n\nNorthwest District\nPopulation: 144,461 \u00a0 Area: 44.14\u00a0km2 (24.7% of the city)  \n\nPopulation density: 3,273 inhab/km2 \u00a0 Housing: 41,740 units\n\n\n\nWest District\nPopulation: 106,356 \u00a0 Area: 40.21\u00a0km2 (22.5% of the city)  \n\nPopulation density: 2,645 inhab/km2 \u00a0 Housing: 31,625 units\n\n\n\nSouthwest District\nPopulation: 103,446 \u00a0 Area: 20.19\u00a0km2 (11.3% of the city)  \n\nPopulation density: 5,123 inhab/km2 \u00a0 Housing: 28,284 units\n\n\n\nSouth District\nPopulation: 160,771 \u00a0 Area: 18.76\u00a0km2 (10.5% of the city)  \n\nPopulation density: 8,569 inhab/km2 \u00a0 Housing: 48,541 units\n\n\n\n## Urban structure[edit]\n\n\n### Centre District[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nDowntown Rosario has many bars and caf\u00e9s.\n![](image)\nThe central offices of the Municipal Bank of Rosario, as pictured in 2006\n\nAt Rosario city center, C\u00f3rdoba Street is the main avenue. It begins at the Flag Memorial Park, climbs towards the district area, and becomes a pedestrian walk for seven blocks, between Plaza 25 de Mayo and Plaza Pringles. Along C\u00f3rdoba Ave to the west *Paseo del Siglo* (\"Walk of the Century\") was settled, with former houses of wealthy families, finally there is also the *San Mart\u00edn Square*, and elsewhere, *Plaza Montenegro* (on *Peatonal San Mart\u00edn*, the pedestrian-only four blocks of San Mart\u00edn Street) and *Plaza Sarmiento*.\n\n\nOro\u00f1o Boulevard (going north\u2013south) and Pellegrini Avenue (east-west) mark the boundaries of the town center together with the river. At their confluence starts the Parque de la Independencia, that houses the Juan B. Castagnino Fine Arts Museum, the Newell's Old Boys football club, and the sports clubs *Provincial* and *Gimnasia y Esgrima*, as well as the horse racetrack and the former *Sociedad Rural* (Rural Society).\n\n\nTowards the south, beyond Pellegrini Avenue, there are two more boulevards, 27 de Febrero and Segu\u00ed, and avenues Uriburu, Arij\u00f3n and Battle y Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez.\nTo the west, after Oro\u00f1o, there are the avenues Ovidio Lagos and Francia, Avellaneda Boulevard and Provincias Unidas Avenue. The main *barrios* in the south are La Tablada, Parque Casado, Las Heras, Las Delicias and Las Flores. The city ends in the Saladillo Stream.\n\n\nAmong the districts in the west are Echesortu, Belgrano, Tri\u00e1ngulo, Moderno, Godoy and Fisherton. To the north-east there lie Pichincha, Ludue\u00f1a, Lisandro de la Torre (home of Rosario Central's stadium) and Empalme Graneros.\n\n\n\n![](image)Night view of the luxury Dolfines Guaran\u00ed Towers, May 2010\nNext to the stadium, there is the Parque Alem, and nearby the Sorrento thermal power plant. To the north lie the districts of Alberdi, La Florida (with a popular beach resort of the same name), Parque Field (built under US President John F. Kennedy's Alliance for Progress development plans) and Rucci. The main streets are Alberdi Avenue and its continuation, Rondeau Boulevard (which leads to the Rosario-Victoria Bridge and the city of Granadero Baigorria). These are crossed by the avenues Las Tres V\u00edas, G\u00e9nova, Sorrento, and Puccio.\n\n\nAn important part of Rosario's urban character is its riverbank. The city recovered the riverbank of the Paran\u00e1 not long ago, thanks to a reorganization of terrains formerly owned by the port and the national railroad system. Going from the center immediately north of the port, the riverbank is surrounded by a large number of parks; Argentine flag Memorial, Parque de Espa\u00f1a, Parque de las Colectividades and Parque Sunchales.\n\n\n\n### Greater Rosario[edit]\n\n\nThrough the years, Rosario has spread in all directions. Towards the south, beyond Pellegrini, there are two more boulevards, 27 de Febrero and Segu\u00ed, and avenues Uriburu, Arij\u00f3n and Battle y Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez.To the west, after Oro\u00f1o, there are the avenues Ovidio Lagos and Francia, Avellaneda Boulevard and Provincias Unidas Avenue. The main neighborhoods in the south are La Tablada, Parque Casado, Las Heras, Las Delicias and Las Flores. The city ends in the Saladillo Stream (the natural border with Villa Gobernador G\u00e1lvez). This is just south of the great barrio Grandoli.\n\n\nAmong the neighborhoods in the west are Echesortu, Belgrano, Tri\u00e1ngulo, Moderno, Godoy, and Fisherton (near the west end of the city, formerly the home of hierarchical personnel of English railroad companies established in Rosario).\nTo the north-east there lie the neighborhoods of Pichincha (a red-light district in the early 20th century, now home to an open-air antiquities fair: *Mercado de antig\u00fcedades \"Feria Retro La Huella\"*), Ludue\u00f1a, Lisandro de la Torre (home of the Rosario Central football club) and Empalme Graneros; these last three are in the influence area of the Ludue\u00f1a Stream, now contained by underground piping, but until the 1980s a source of floods.\n\n\nNext to the Rosario Central stadium, there is a large park, Parque Alem, and not far from it, there stands the Sorrento thermoelectric power plant. North of the Lisandro de la Torre neighborhood, there are Alberdi (formerly an independent town), La Florida (with a popular beach resort of the same name), and Rucci.\n\n\nThe main streets in the north are Alberdi Avenue and its continuation, Rondeau Boulevard (which leads to the north exit of the city, the access to the Rosario-Victoria Bridge, and the town of Granadero Baigorria). These major arteries are crossed by several avenues: Las Tres V\u00edas, G\u00e9nova, Sorrento, and Puccio.\n\n\n\n## Transportation[edit]\n\n\nRosario's strategic location is destined to become a significant transportation hub and as the bi-oceanic corridor that links the State of Rio Grande do Sul (Brazil), an important component in global distribution and the core center of a key corridor in the Mercosur, the Common Market for the South.[36]\n\n\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Rosario, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 50 min. 9% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 14 min, while 19% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 4.3\u00a0km, while 4% travel for over 12\u00a0km in a single direction.[37]\n\n\n\n### Road transport[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Front entrance and clock tower of the Mariano Moreno Bus Terminal in Rosario\n![](image)Trolleybus in the city centre\n![](image)The city had a tramway network until 1963.\nThe Rosario public transport system includes buses, trolleybuses and taxicabs.\n\n\nThe Rosario trolleybus system consists of only one main trunk line. It is presently operated by a government-owned corporation, SEMTUR (Sociedad del Estado Municipal para el Transporte Urbano de Rosario, \"Municipal State Society for Rosario Urban Transport\"), as are some of Rosario's other urban bus lines.\n\n\nPlaza Sarmiento is the hub of the city bus system, about 40 urban lines in the metropolitan area that provide service every 5 to 10 minutes.\n\n\nBus fares are pre-paid by means of either a rechargeable plastic card or a disposable paper card with a magnetic stripe which can be bought from post offices, automatic vending machines, and private businesses. For occasional use, a larger fare can be paid using a coin machine in the bus unit. The interurban lines have differential fares, and some allow payment in cash only. The municipal administration is phasing out the paper cards, in favor of the plastic ones, during the second half of 2012.\n\n\nThe urban bus fleet was partially renewed during the recovery of the national economy, since 2003, and consists of about 730 units. In 2005 the average age of the buses was five years and 11 months. Improvements in the economy have led to increased use of public transport and comparatively less use of bicycles. According to the Rosario Transportation Office, in 2005 there were about 11 million bus journeys per month,[38] by 2007, usage has climbed to 420,000 people every day (12.6 million per month).\n\n\nA significant number of buses run on natural gas, as it also happens in Argentina as a whole since the price of this fuel is quite low compared to the alternatives. The idea to transform all buses to this system did not prosper; most buses run on heavily subsidized diesel fuel.\n\n\nIn 2012 bus lanes were added to several pairs of parallel streets traversing the downtown area.[1] Bus stops along these are spaced every three blocks instead of the usual two. For the most part, they leave room to only one additional, narrow lane on the left for cars and other vehicles. They can be used for taxis carrying passengers as well. They are exclusive for public transport during weekdays and on Saturday morning; stopping or parking on the affected streets is forbidden, as well as right turns. Their implementation attracted opposition from residents and shop owners but was well received by habitual bus users since they reduce the time needed to get out of the crowded central area by a noticeable amount.[39]\n\n\nRosario has a medium-sized taxi fleet, with units painted black and outlined in yellow. Some belong to radio-taxi companies and can be reserved by telephone; others only in the streets. As the economy of Argentina recovers, the capacity of the taxi fleet has been strained by higher usage. In September 2005, the Deliberative Council approved the compulsory installation of radio-call systems in all taxi units, but this requirement has not been fulfilled.\n\n\nRosario is also a major hub for long-distance overland transportation from the Mariano Moreno Bus Terminal,[40] (*Terminal de Omnibus*), across from the Patio de la Madera Convention and Exposition Centre complex, about 15 blocks west of Plaza San Martin.\nThe transportation facility serves 73 bus companies in short, medium, and long-distance travel, carrying 1,100.000 passengers per month to 784 national and international destinations, which comprise most major domestic cities including Puerto Iguaz\u00fa, Salta and Bariloche and international destinations such as Asunci\u00f3n, Paraguay, Curitiba and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and Montevideo, Uruguay, destinations may be long but white-clad chauffeurs handle comfortable long-distance coaches with modern conveniences.\n\n\n\n### Railway[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Nuevo Central Argentino (NCA) freight railway yards\n![](image)Rosario Sur Station, refurbished to run inter-city services on the General Mitre Railway\n![](image)Rosario Norte\n![](image)The Center Municipal District (former Rosario Central station)\nRosario was one of the main cities chosen by the British and French railway companies that built and operated some of the railways in Argentina during the 19th and early 20th centuries, with more than 15 stations operating in the city. When the entire Argentine railway network was nationalised during the presidency of Juan Per\u00f3n, most of the stations (by then under the administration of State-owned company Ferrocarriles Argentinos) were closed for passenger services to reduce costs, leaving only a few active.\n\n\nAfter the railway privatization in the early 1990s during Carlos Menem's presidency, the passenger services were considerably reduced. The lines operated by Nuevo Central Argentino (NCA) handle most of the cargo. Additionally, two private companies provided limited passenger services to several major cities. Trenes de Buenos Aires (TBA) ran weekly trains south to Retiro in Buenos Aires and north to Santa Fe. The company Ferrocentral also operated weekly trains south to Buenos Aires and northwest to C\u00f3rdoba and Tucum\u00e1n.\n\n\nNowadays, passenger services to Rosario are being operated by state-owned company Trenes Argentinos, running trains to Rosario Norte[41] with stop in Rosario Sur.\n\n\nThe other station in the main district, Rosario Oeste, used to concentrate all the passenger services when railways were nationalised in 1948, but currently operates for freight trains only.\n\n\nAs of June 2021, only two stations remain active for passenger services in the city. The following chart describes the total of existing railway stations in Rosario:\n\n\n\n\n\n**Railway stations in Rosario**\n| Station\n | Original company\n | Nationalised\n | Status (passenger)\n | Current operator\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Rosario | C\u00f3rdoba and Rosario | Belgrano | Closed (1949) [note 1] | \u2014\n |\n| Rosario Central | Central Argentine | Mitre | Closed (1977) [note 2] | \u2014\n |\n| Rosario Norte [note 3] | BA & Rosario | Mitre | Active | Trenes Argentinos / NCA |\n| Rosario Oeste | C\u00f3rdoba Central | Belgrano | Closed (1993) | Trenes Argentinos CyL |\n| Rosario | Santa Fe Western | Mitre | Closed (1900) [note 4] | \u2014\n |\n| Rosario | Prov.

The network is currently in the bidding process, with large firms like Siemens and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China bidding for its construction.[51] It is expected to begin at the recently inaugurated Rosario Sur Station and run northwards through the city.[52]\n\n\n\n### Roadways[edit]\n\n\nRosario is linked to the rest of the country by a number of roads: the Aramburu Highway (southeast, to Buenos Aires), National Route 9 (from Buenos Aires to Rosario and then north and west up to Jujuy and Bolivia), the Brigadier Estanislao L\u00f3pez Highway (north, to Santa Fe City), National Route 11 (to the north of Santa Fe, Formosa and Paraguay), National Route 33 (to the southwest of Santa Fe and the province of Buenos Aires, and then through National Route 7 to San Luis, Mendoza and Chile), National Route 34 (north to Santiago del Estero, Tucum\u00e1n and Bolivia), and National Route 174 (east, to Entre R\u00edos, over the Rosario-Victoria Bridge).\n\n\nIt is surrounded with an extensive system of two belt-highways called Circunvalaci\u00f3n Motorway and A012 which in turn set the limits of the city.\n\n\nThe beltway is 30\u00a0km (19\u00a0mi) and was built for traffic to avoid the congested city centre, allowing drivers to bypass the city going around it in a much shorter time.\nIn its 30-kilometre (19\u00a0mi) length, it intersects with National Route 9, National Route 3, National Route 34, National Route 11 and National Route 174.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Rosario-Victoria Bridge\nThe official numbering system denotes this road as \"A008\" but this denomination is mostly unknown by the locals as it is still called \"*Avenida de Circunvalaci\u00f3n 25 de Mayo*\" (\"*25 of May Beltway Avenue*\") commemorating the May Revolution of 1810. Some sections are named after different personalities by local decree. For example:\n\n\n\n* The section from the east end on 27 Boulevard to the crossing of Ayacucho Street (old exit to the Rosario-Buenos Aires Highway, now access to Provincial Route 21), is called *\"National Route A008 Tte. General Juan Carlos S\u00e1nchez\"* by decree #232 of 14 May 1981.\n* The section between National Route 9 and the exit to Santa Fe (the state capital) National Route 11 on the intersection with Rondeau Boulevard is called *\"National Route A008 Dr. Constantino Razzetti\"* by law #25769 of 1 September 2003.\n\n\nThe A012 is the second beltway at the southeast of the city. It has a semi-circular length centered around the city, running as a long-length beltway. From the National Route 9 junction on km marker 278, in the town of Esther, to the junction with National Route 11 on km marker 326 in the city of San Lorenzo it runs for 67\u00a0km (41.6\u00a0mi).\n\n\nThis road is popularly known as the *Second Rosario Beltway*, as it borders the metropolitan area of greater Rosario.\nThrough National Decree 1595 of 1979[53] this road switched to federal control. Beforehand this road was called Provincial Route 16.\n\n\n\n### Airports[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Rosario International Airport\n\n![](image)Rosario International Airport\nThe Rosario \u2013 Islas Malvinas International Airport is located 13\u00a0km (8\u00a0mi) west-northwest from the center of Rosario, a city in the Santa Fe Province of Argentina. The city of Funes lies directly to the west of the airport, and part of the city limit shares a border with the property of the airport grounds. The airport covers an area of 550 hectares (1,400 acres) and is operated by the Province of Santa Fe.[54][55]\n\n\nThe airport serves the Greater Rosario area and is the main hub for Sol L\u00edneas A\u00e9reas and is also served by Aerol\u00edneas Argentinas, Copa and Gol Transportes A\u00e9reos. There are domestic flights within Argentina from Rosario to Buenos Aires, C\u00f3rdoba, Mar del Plata (via Buenos Aires), Mendoza (v\u00eda C\u00f3rdoba), Santa Fe and Villa Gesell (via Buenos Aires) cities as well as international services to, Porto Alegre, Brazil, and Punta del Este, Uruguay (direct flight in summer and via Buenos Aires in fall, winter and spring).\nThe airport is at an altitude of 25 metres (82\u00a0ft). Its longest runway measures 3,000 metres (9,843\u00a0ft).\n\n\n\n### Port[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Port of Rosario\n\n![](image)The Port of Rosario, c.\u20091910\nThe Port of Rosario is an inland port and a major goods-shipping centre of Argentina, located in the city of Rosario, province of Santa Fe, on the left-hand (western) shore of the Paran\u00e1 River, about 550\u00a0km (340\u00a0mi) upstream from the Atlantic Ocean.[56][57]\n\n\nAt this point of the course of the Paran\u00e1 River (Kilometer 420, Mile 260), there is the depth transition between overseas and river navigation. The main channel of the river directly in front of the port has an advantageous configuration that allows preservation of a depth of 10 metres (34\u00a0ft) with minor periodic dredging. This allows for downstream navigation of vessels up to Panamax standards. The Paran\u00e1 is about 600 metres (1,970\u00a0ft) wide at Kilometer 418. It becomes 2,000\u00a0m (1.2\u00a0mi) wide downstream.\n\n\nThe port is the largest of a series located in the several cities of the Greater Rosario that lie on the Paran\u00e1; the last (northernmost) able of overseas traffic being Puerto General San Mart\u00edn (23\u00a0km (14\u00a0mi). It is part of the Bi-Oceanic Corridor, which joins the Atlantic with the Pacific Ocean via Buenos Aires, Rosario, C\u00f3rdoba, and the Cuyo region; going north\u2013south it forms the axis of the Paraguay-Paran\u00e1 waterway. It directly services the area of Santa Fe that produces a large portion of Argentine exports, and indirectly the whole Mercosur trade bloc. In 2003 the traffic in the port amounted to 2.9\u00a0million tonnes (3,200,000 short tons).\n\n\nCargo from other parts of Argentina is brought into the port by the railway lines of the Nuevo Central Argentino, communicating with C\u00f3rdoba (west) and Z\u00e1rate, Buenos Aires (south), as well as the multiple national and provincial roads and highways that converge in Rosario. Communication with the north-eastern part of the country was enhanced by the 2003 opening of the Rosario-Victoria Bridge, that joins the city with the province of Entre R\u00edos. The Rosario International Airport (located 15\u00a0km (9\u00a0mi) west) has also been refurbished to work with cargo traffic.\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Teachers' School, on C\u00f3rdoba Avenue\n![](image)National University of Rosario Law School\nRosario is an important educational centre at a national and international level. It is the home of the National University of Rosario (UNR) since 1968, which includes the Law Faculty, the Medicine Faculty, the Humanities Faculty and an advanced study centre called *Ciudad Universitaria de Rosario* (university city of Rosario) that is home to more than 10 colleges, among them the Faculty of Psychology, the Faculty of Political Sciences, and the Faculty of Architecture. It is also home of the Rosario Regional Faculty, a branch of the National Technological University (UTN). All of these national colleges are free.\n\n\nIn the city there are approximately 624 establishments destined for elementary levels and secondary education, the Technical Institute, which depends directly on the UNR. With a solid tradition as for university education, it is head of several academic institutions, and is public, and free access.\n\n\nCurrently, there are some 80,000 university students at various institutions around the city, representing approximately 8.5% of the total population. This rate is one of the highest in Argentina. In Rosario, nearly 15% of the population benefits from higher education degrees, or have undergone at least some university studies.\n\n\nRosario has private colleges, as the Pontifical Catholic University of Argentina (UCA), the Austral University, the University of the Latin American Educational Center (UCEL), the Interamerican Open University (UAI), the Italian University of Rosario (IUNIR), the San Martin University and the University of Concepcion del Uruguay which are private institutions.\n\n\n\n## Language[edit]\n\n\nRosario is the third largest urban center where Rioplatense Spanish is spoken, after Buenos Aires and Montevideo. The local language evidences the typical linguistic features that characterize this dialect, notably the voseo (use of *vos* instead of *t\u00fa* as pronoun for the second person singular) and the *she\u00edsmo* (form of ye\u00edsmo where *ll-* and *y-* are pronounced as a voiceless [\u0283]). Although the *espa\u00f1ol rosarino* does not differ substantially from the other variants of the same dialect, it presents particularities easily noticeable by those who live in the other main populated areas of the region.\n\n\nOne of the most notable characteristics of the language of Rosario's area of influence is the process of aspiration and disappearance of the *-s*. When the *-s* is in implosive position, end of syllable or word followed by consonant, its sound becomes a soft and voiceless aspiration [h] (the word *obispo* is pronounced **o\u031e\u02c8\u03b2ihpo\u031e**). In the popular and vulgar language, the final *-s*, *-r*, or *-d* are sometimes suppressed, although this phenomenon is commonly associated to sociocultural groups of lower formal education.[58]\n\n\nJust as in Buenos Aires, the *voseo* is pronominal and verbal. The pronoun *t\u00fa* and its associated verbal forms are inexistent (which is not the case of the Montevideo variant) The tendency to add a final *-s* to the verbal forms of the second person plural (*vos fuistes*, *vos vinistes*), which is rather common in Buenos Aires, is very unusual among Rosario natives.\n\n\nEven though the lexicon of Rosario and Buenos Aires is effectively identical, there are numerous terms and idioms that Rosario shares with the rest of the country (even areas where a different dialect prevails) but not with the capital, as well as other words and expressions that are unique to the *rosarino* speech, both formal and informal.\n\n\nThe *Rosarigasino* is a type of Jerigonza (game of words) that originated in the city and was rather common in the informal speech during the 20th century. Although it has fallen into disuse, it has become a language of cult among certain local groups.\n\n\n\n## Sports[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lionel Messi, born in Rosario in 1987\nRosario is the home of the football clubs Rosario Central (founded 1889) and Newell's Old Boys (founded 1903). Both play in Primera Divisi\u00f3n Argentina. Central has won four National championships (in 1971, 1973, 1980 and in 1987), six National cups (1913, 1915, two cups in 1916, 1920 and 2018),[59][60] and one international title: the Conmebol Cup (in 1995, precursor of the current Copa Sudamericana).[61][62][63][64][65][66]\nNewell's has 6 National championships (in 1974, 1988, 1991, 1992, 2004 and in 2013) and 3 National cups (in 1911, 1921 and in 1949). Rosario's other football clubs are Club Atl\u00e9tico Central C\u00f3rdoba, currently playing in Primera C, Club Atl\u00e9tico Tiro Federal Argentino in Torneo Argentino A and Argentino de Rosario in Primera D.\n\n\nIt is also the hometown of Argentine internationals Lionel Messi, \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda, Maximiliano Rodr\u00edguez, C\u00e9sar Delgado, Ezequiel Lavezzi, Mauro Icardi, Giovani Lo Celso, Leandro Fern\u00e1ndez, Ezequiel Garay, Luciana Aymar, Juan Imhoff, \u00c1ngel Correa, Nicol\u00e1s Vergallo and Leonardo Senatore.\n\n\nThe city received international attention as the host of the II South American Games in 1982, as one of the host cities of the 1978 FIFA World Cup, the 1982 FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship, the 1993 FIVB Volleyball Men's U21 World Championship, the 2001 FIFA World Youth Championship and the 1990 Basketball World Cup.[67] Rosario also bid for the 2019 Pan American Games but the Argentine Olympic Committee (COA) voted to support La Punta instead.[68]\n\n\nRosario is the second choice site for Argentine rugby tests, after Buenos Aires. Famous rugby clubs from the city include Club Atl\u00e9tico del Rosario \u2013 one of the four UAR founding clubs \u2013 and also Jockey Club de Rosario and Duendes Rugby Club, both former winners of the Nacional de Clubes title. The city hosted the 2010 IRB Junior World Championship.\n\n\nThe 2010 Women's Hockey World Cup, 2004 and 2012 Champions Trophy and the 2014\u201315 Women's FIH Hockey World League Final were played there.\n\n\nIn 2014 the city hosted the Inline speed skating World Championship at Parque de la Independencia[69] and in 2015 it hosted the men's, women's and juniors' FIRS Inline Hockey World Championships at Club Atl\u00e9tico Provincial's indoor arena.[70]\n\n\nRosario hosted the 2017 World Archery Youth Championships, and will host the 2018 FIBA Under-17 Basketball World Cup, and the 2019 South American Beach Games.\n\n\n\n### Motorsports[edit]\n\n\nThe city was the starting point for the 2014 Dakar Rally, as well as the finishing point in 2016. It also hosted the 2015 World RX of Argentina.\n\n\n\n## Events[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Participants carry the national colors on Flag Day (June 20).\n* *Festival Latinoamericano de Video Rosario* (Rosario Latin American Video Festival).

Annual event, starting in 1985, showcasing music, song, dance, cuisine and customs of foreign communities in Argentina, in the ample room provided by the *Parque Nacional a la Bandera* (National Flag Park). Usually held in November; in 2004 it was postponed to the beginning of December in order to avoid overlap with the Third International Congress of the Spanish Language.\n* *Festival Internacional de Poes\u00eda de Rosario* (International Poetry Festival). Annual event since 1993 (November).\n* *Festival Iberoamericano de Cine de Rosario* (Ibero-American Film Festival). Annual event since 2003 (November).\n* *Leyendas* (\"Legends\").

Annually since 1999, usually in autumn (April/May), sometimes in spring (November).\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Rosario\n\n![](image)Rosario metropolitan area in the Province of Santa Fe\nThe city of Rosario measures 178.69\u00a0km2 (69.0\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), not all of them are fully urbanized. Its extreme points are:\n\n\n\n* Latitude: parallels 32\u00b052\u203218\u2033 and 33\u00b002\u203222\u2033 South.\n* Longitude: meridians 60\u00b036\u203244\u2033 and 60\u00b047\u203246\u2033 West.\n\n\nThe geographical center is approximately at 32\u00b057\u20322\u2033S 60\u00b042\u203215\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff32.95056\u00b0S 60.70417\u00b0W\ufeff / -32.95056; -60.70417\n\n\nThe city is located on a smoothly undulated plain typical of the Pampas, between 22.5 and 24.6 metres above mean sea level; the original settlement rests on the ravine on the right-hand shore of the Paran\u00e1, opposite a group of islands of the Paran\u00e1 Delta which are partly in the jurisdiction of the province of Entre R\u00edos. The nearest city across the river's flood plain (60\u00a0km) is Victoria, Entre R\u00edos, linked to Rosario by the Rosario-Victoria Bridge.\n\n\nRosario lies on the ravine of the right-hand shore of the Paran\u00e1, about 24 metres (79\u00a0ft) above mean sea level, in a place with a natural slope to the low shore. The point of origin of the city is *Plaza 25 de Mayo* (\"May 25 Square\"), now surrounded by the municipality (*Palacio de los Leones*), the Basilica Cathedral of Our Lady of the Rosary, the Central Post Office, the Decorative Art Museum and a building called *La Bola de Nieve* (\"The Snowball\"). Between the Cathedral and the municipal building is *Pasaje Juramento* (\"Oath Passage\"), leading to the Flag Memorial. The streets mostly follow a regular checkerboard pattern.\n\n\n\n## Climate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Climate chart\nThe Rosario area has a *Pampean*, humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: Cfa/Cwa),[71] and is well known for its changeable weather conditions. The city has average temperatures of 23.7\u00a0\u00b0C (74.7\u00a0\u00b0F) maximum and 11.8\u00a0\u00b0C (53.2\u00a0\u00b0F) minimum. The annual rainfall is 1,038\u00a0mm (40.9\u00a0in).\n\n\nRosario is usually warmer than other mainland Argentine capital cities in the winter. The lowest average in winter is 4.4\u00a0\u00b0C (40\u00a0\u00b0F). This is due in part to the city's flat topography, its situation on the Paran\u00e1 River bank, and the presence of high density of urbanization. Those conditions have created a microclimate known as urban heat island that often means that the city is significantly warmer than its surrounding rural areas.\n\n\nThe temperature difference usually is larger at night than during the day and larger in winter than in summer, and is most apparent when winds are weak. However, snowfalls are extremely rare: the most recent occurrence of sleet in the CBD was on 9 July 2007.\nDuring the spring, Rosario commonly enjoys extended periods of warm weather and clear skies. On average, Rosario has average day-night temperatures of 23\u201310\u00a0\u00b0C (73\u201350\u00a0\u00b0F). The city experiences hot and humid summer days, with maximum temperatures above 35\u00a0\u00b0C (95\u00a0\u00b0F), when northerly winds blow humid air from Brazil. The record high temperature is 40.5\u00a0\u00b0C (104.9\u00a0\u00b0F) on January 9, 2006, while the record low is \u22128.4\u00a0\u00b0C (17\u00a0\u00b0F) on July 15, 2020.[72]\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Rosario (Islas Malvinas Airport), elevation: 25 m, 1991\u20132020 normals, extremes 1875\u2013present\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 40.6(105.1)\n | 39.3(102.7)\n | 37.0(98.6)\n | 34.3(93.7)\n | 32.9(91.2)\n | 29.6(85.3)\n | 31.6(88.9)\n | 36.1(97.0)\n | 37.3(99.1)\n | 38.0(100.4)\n | 39.5(103.1)\n | 40.7(105.3)\n | 40.7(105.3)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 30.9(87.6)\n | 29.4(84.9)\n | 27.7(81.9)\n | 23.9(75.0)\n | 20.1(68.2)\n | 17.0(62.6)\n | 16.5(61.7)\n | 19.2(66.6)\n | 21.5(70.7)\n | 24.3(75.7)\n | 27.5(81.5)\n | 29.8(85.6)\n | 24.0(75.2)\n |\n| Daily mean \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 24.8(76.6)\n | 23.4(74.1)\n | 21.5(70.7)\n | 17.7(63.9)\n | 14.2(57.6)\n | 11.0(51.8)\n | 10.1(50.2)\n | 12.3(54.1)\n | 15.0(59.0)\n | 18.2(64.8)\n | 21.3(70.3)\n | 23.6(74.5)\n | 17.8(64.0)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 18.7(65.7)\n | 17.7(63.9)\n | 16.0(60.8)\n | 12.4(54.3)\n | 9.4(48.9)\n | 6.2(43.2)\n | 4.9(40.8)\n | 6.3(43.3)\n | 8.7(47.7)\n | 12.3(54.1)\n | 15.0(59.0)\n | 17.3(63.1)\n | 12.1(53.8)\n |\n| Record low \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 7.0(44.6)\n | 5.0(41.0)\n | 1.2(34.2)\n | \u22120.9(30.4)\n | \u22126.1(21.0)\n | \u22128.1(17.4)\n | \u22128.4(16.9)\n | \u22127.8(18.0)\n | \u22124.8(23.4)\n | \u22121.2(29.8)\n | 1.8(35.2)\n | 5.1(41.2)\n | \u22128.4(16.9)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 120.7(4.75)\n | 127.4(5.02)\n | 138.4(5.45)\n | 119.9(4.72)\n | 57.7(2.27)\n | 28.3(1.11)\n | 23.0(0.91)\n | 35.3(1.39)\n | 48.0(1.89)\n | 118.7(4.67)\n | 108.2(4.26)\n | 127.9(5.04)\n | 1,053.5(41.48)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (\u2265 0.1 mm) | 7.3\n | 7.7\n | 7.4\n | 8.5\n | 5.3\n | 4.5\n | 4.2\n | 3.6\n | 5.3\n | 8.9\n | 8.2\n | 9.0\n | 79.8\n |\n| Average snowy days\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.1\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.1\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 67.8\n | 72.8\n | 75.4\n | 78.1\n | 81.0\n | 80.9\n | 77.9\n | 72.6\n | 68.5\n | 69.3\n | 65.6\n | 65.5\n | 73.0\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 297.6\n | 240.1\n | 235.6\n | 183.0\n | 173.6\n | 147.0\n | 173.6\n | 195.3\n | 195.0\n | 223.2\n | 267.0\n | 288.3\n | 2,619.3\n |\n| Mean daily sunshine hours | 9.6\n | 8.5\n | 7.6\n | 6.1\n | 5.6\n | 4.9\n | 5.6\n | 6.3\n | 6.5\n | 7.2\n | 8.9\n | 9.3\n | 7.2\n |\n| Percent possible sunshine | 73\n | 71\n | 64\n | 64\n | 58\n | 50\n | 52\n | 59\n | 56\n | 58\n | 65\n | 65\n | 61\n |\n| Source 1: Servicio Meteorol\u00f3gico Nacional[73][74][75] |\n| Source 2: Meteo Climat (record highs and lows),[76] Oficina de Riesgo Agropecuario (March/April/October/November/December record highs, and July/September/October/December record low),[77] UNLP (percent sun 1971\u20131980)[78] |\n\n## Broadcasting and communications[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rosario offices of Telecom Argentina\n![](image)Headquarters of *La Capital* newspaper\nRosario has two private local television channels, Canal 3 and Canal 5 (the latter is part of the national network Telef\u00e9), and a relay station for the public national station, Canal 7 Argentina. There are also three cable TV networks (the national ones Cablevisi\u00f3n and Multicanal, and a local network, Cablehogar), which support two local channels, Canal 4 Noticias and Canal 6.\n\n\nThere are four AM radio stations: three private (licensed by the state) ones, LT3 Radio 2 (LT2), and LT8, and one public, Radio Nacional Rosario, property of the national state. Among the multitude (above 200) of FM stations, some notable ones are FM Vida, Estaci\u00f3n del Siglo, FM Del Rosario, Cristal FM, Radio Hollywood, Fisherton-CNN, Continental Rosario, Radio 10 Rosario, Radiof\u00f3nica, and Cl\u00e1sica Rosario.\n\n\nThe city has three notable newspapers: *La Capital* (Argentina's oldest newspaper, founded in 1867, and still published today), *Rosario/12* (founded in 1991), and *El Ciudadano & La Regi\u00f3n* (founded in 1999).\n\n\nRosario is located at the center of Argentina's optical fiber ring. The main data transport companies offer all their services in the city, from public phones to mobile networks and broadband Internet access through DSL, cable modem and Wi-Fi, and including public Internet navigation centers (cybercafes).\n\n\nAbout 96% of homes have a domestic telephone line, giving a total of 472,170 lines; cell phone usage has also become pervasive, as happened in Argentina as a whole since the beginning of the 21st century, reaching over 86% of the residents (866,000 mobile lines in July 2004). This demand, boosted by low prices and sale promotions, and coupled with restrictions on the installation of antennas and alleged lack of investment by the providers, sometimes degrades the quality of the service. Most notably, the mobile network collapsed almost completely in the celebrations of Christmas, New Year's Day and Friend's Day in 2004 and 2005.\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\nNotable people from Rosario include the following:\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| * Luciana Aymar, field hockey player\n* Gato Barbieri, jazz composer\n* Antonio Berni, painter\n* Marcelo Bielsa, football coach\n* Emiliano Boffelli, rugby union player\n* Felipe Martinez Carbonell, film director[79]\n* \u00c1ngel Correa, football player\n* Jos\u00e9 Cura, operatic tenor[80][81]\n* \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda, football player\n* Lucio Fontana, artist\n* Roberto Fontanarrosa, cartoonist\n* Ang\u00e9lica Gorodischer, writer\n* Che Guevara, revolutionary\n* Hugo Guti\u00e9rrez, football player\n* Jana Rodriguez Hertz, mathematician\n* Mauro Icardi, football player\n | * Juan Imhoff, rugby union player\n* Libertad Lamarque, actress\n* Giovanni Lo Celso, football player\n* Gerardo Martino, football player and coach\n* Valeria Mazza, model\n* Yamile Saied Mendez, writer\n* C\u00e9sar Luis Menotti, football coach\n* Lionel Messi, football player\n* Alberto Olmedo, actor/comedian\n* Fito P\u00e1ez, singer-songwriter\n* Patricio Pron, writer\n* Maximiliano Rodr\u00edguez, football player\n* Leonardo Senatore, rugby union player\n* Dorothy Wrinch, mathematician and biochemical theorist\n* Alberto Demiddi, rower\n* Juan Carlos Baglietto, singer\n\n\n |\n\n* ![Libertad Lamarque](image)\n\nLibertad Lamarque\n* ![Che Guevara](image)\n\nChe Guevara\n* ![\u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda](image)\n\n\u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda\n* ![Lionel Messi](image)\n\nLionel Messi\n* ![Luciana Aymar](image)\n\nLuciana Aymar\n* ![Marcelo Bielsa](image)\n\nMarcelo Bielsa\n* ![Valeria Mazza](image)\n\nValeria Mazza\n* ![Juan Imhoff](image)\n\nJuan Imhoff\n* ![Felipe Martinez Carbonell](image)\n\nFelipe Martinez Carbonell\n\n\n## Twin towns \u2013 sister cities[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of twin towns and sister cities in Argentina\n\nRosario is twinned with:[82]\n\n\n\n* ![Italy](image) Alessandria, Italy\n* ![Kazakhstan](image) Almaty, Kazakhstan\n* ![Paraguay](image) Asunci\u00f3n, Paraguay\n* ![Spain](image) Bilbao, Spain\n* ![Venezuela](image) Caracas, Venezuela\n* ![Ecuador](image) Cuenca, Ecuador\n* ![Senegal](image) Dakar, Senegal\n* ![Israel](image) Haifa, Israel\n* ![Italy](image) Imperia, Italy\n* ![Kuwait](image) Kuwait City, Kuwait\n* ![Colombia](image) Manizales, Colombia\n* ![Colombia](image) Medell\u00edn, Colombia\n* ![Mexico](image) Monterrey, Mexico\n* ![Uruguay](image) Montevideo, Uruguay\n* ![Greece](image) Piraeus, Greece\n* ![Peru](image) Pisco, Peru\n* ![Brazil](image) Porto Alegre, Brazil\n* ![China](image) Shanghai, China\n* ![Cuba](image) Santa Clara, Cuba\n* ![Bolivia](image) Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia\n* ![Cuba](image) Santiago de Cuba, Cuba\n* ![Dominican Republic](image) Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic\n* ![United States](image) St. Louis, United States\n* ![Italy](image) Turin, Italy\n* ![Chile](image) Valpara\u00edso, Chile\n\n### Cooperation agreements[edit]\n\n\nRosario also cooperates with:[83]\n\n\n\n* ![Chile](image) Vi\u00f1a del Mar, Chile\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Argentina portal\n\n\n* History of Rosario\n* Port of Rosario\n* Geography of Rosario\n* Government of Rosario\n* Districts of Rosario\n* Olinto Gallo Workshops\n* Palacio Cabanellas\n* Parana River steamers\n* Rondeau Boulevard\n* 2013 Rosario gas explosion\n* Fernando Traverso's Bicis\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** \"Sitio de la Municipalidad de Rosario\". *Sitio de la Municipalidad de Rosario*.\n2. **^** P\u00e1gina del Ministerio de Educaci\u00f3n de la Naci\u00f3n sobre el Monumento Hist\u00f3rico Nacional a la Bandera.
